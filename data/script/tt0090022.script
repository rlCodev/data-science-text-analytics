               INT. SHACK - DAY

               Darkness. Quiet. The CAMERA MOVES through the gloom of the 
               small, dirty, wooden hut, past a broken table, over a well-
               worn saddle lying on the floor. Now, a pair of boots standing 
               empty by the rotting remains of a rough-hewn bunk, up to a 
               holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed. The still shape 
               of a man, a bedroll his only protection from the splintery 
               planks. This is EMMETT, fast asleep.

               The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes in. 
               For a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morning 
               light, his two six-guns blasting even before the door has 
               bounced shut behind him, returning the hut to darkness.

               Emmett's holster, the gun gone.

               The gun is here in Emmett's hand, erupting now with three 
               quick explosions. The intruder flies against the far wall of 
               the hut and lands on the floor dead. From outside, two bullets 
               pierce the plank wall behind Emmett, light streaming through 
               in .45 calibre shafts.

               Emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor. He fires once 
               over the bunk. In the moment of quiet that follows, we hear 
               running FOOTSTEPS outside the hut. Emmett follows their 
               progress with the point of his gun, but holds his fire. 
               Suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the 
               shack, and the table disintegrates in a new column of light.

               Emmett glances upward, but quickly returns his attention to 
               the side walls, trying to follow that gunman. Now more fire 
               comes from there and more footsteps. Another shotgun blast 
               showers Emmett with debris, but he ignores it, concentrating 
               on the walls.

               WHAT HE SEES. The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack in 
               the wall, momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the 
               light. Emmett fires once ahead of him, stopping his progress 
               and forcing him back to the crack. Emmett fires his last 
               shot there, and the man outside goes down hard.

               The shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and blows 
               a crater in the dirt by Emmett's foot. The shape of a man 
               flashes across the new hole. Emmett looks across the room at 
               the top bunk, where the barrel of his Winchester protrudes a 
               few inches from the bare planks. Emmett throws his empty six-
               gun noisily into the far corner of the hut. Instantly the 
               man on the roof blasts away in that direction.

               Emmett dives for the bunk. With the tips of his fingers, he 
               pulls hard on the muzzle. The Winchester flips full circle 
               into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above.

               With an odd kind of inevitability, as though seeking its 
               rightful place, the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light, 
               where it is met by Emmett's steady, waiting hands. Before it 
               has even settled, he has cocked and fired twice through a 
               hole in the roof. Emmett stops and lowers the carbine. The 
               Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened 
               ceiling. Debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form.

               Emmett listens, moves silently to the door, and opens it 
               carefully. WE FOLLOW him outside, out into the bright 
               sunlight, into the awesome promise of the American West.

               EXT. SHACK - DAY

               Emmett moves warily around the isolated shack. There are no 
               more attackers. He looks off into the distance. Two riderless 
               horses, galloping away, are the only moving things in the 
               empty landscape. A third saddled horse, a pinto, stands 
               nervously near Emmett's horse, which is tied to a stake.

               Emmett walks to the body of the Man Outside and looks down 
               at him. He doesn't know him. He moves to the pinto and calms 
               it. He examines the distinctive brand on its flank, a circle 
               with two wavy lines beneath it. Emmett is clearly mystified. 
               He rests his arms on the saddle and stares after the 
               retreating horses.

               THE MAIN TITLE BEGINS.

               EXT. EMMETT RIDES (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY/NIGHT

               Emmett travels, the saddled pinto in tow. He moves from high 
               mountain terrain down-country, through meadow and canyon. He 
               makes night camp near a rushing stream. The land flattens as 
               he approaches the desert. The sun beats at him as he dismounts 
               at the edge of a white-hot plain. He takes a short pull from 
               his canteen and squints off across the flat, empty space. 
               All he can see ahead is blinding sand and blue sky.

               THE MAIN TITLE ENDS.

               EXT. DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

               Emmett is now surrounded by the white blankness, moving slowly 
               under the broiling sun.

               He stops his walking horses and squints out into the distance, 
               seeing something. We see it too, but just barely: a distant, 
               horizontal smudge on the glaring sand.

               Emmett reaches the smudge. It is a man, barefoot and dressed 
               only in longjohns, his head propped on a rock, eyes closed. 
               The man's skin is burned red and beginning to blister, his 
               lips parched. Yet there is a curious ease to his repose. If 
               he has lain down here to die, he has done it in peace. This 
               is PADEN.

               Emmett lifts Paden's head and puts the canteen to his lips. 
               Paden's eyes struggle to open in the glare. He takes a few 
               sips of the water. His lips crack with a slight smile at the 
               taste. He looks up at Emmett, takes another sip, and tries 
               to speak. Emmett must lean down to hear his raspy whisper as 
               he tries again.

                                     PADEN
                         Pleased to meet you.

               EXT. NIGHT CAMP - DESERT - NIGHT

               The terrain here is more hospitable. Paden, wrapped snugly 
               in a blanket, lies with his head against the saddle from the 
               pinto. Emmett is preparing his bedroll across the fire.

                                     EMMETT
                         Two of the horses ran off, but that 
                         pinto you're riding hung around.

                                     PADEN
                         You got no idea what they were after?

               Emmett shakes his head "no".

                                     PADEN
                         Offend anybody lately?

                                     EMMETT
                         Not for five years.

               Paden understands.

                                     PADEN
                         Jefferson City?

                                     EMMETT
                         No, Leavenworth.

                                     PADEN
                         I've never been in there. They just 
                         jumped you out of the blue?

                                     EMMETT
                         I had to get up anyway.

                                     PADEN
                              (smiles)
                         Me, I'm riding along, minding my own 
                         business. Four cowboys come by and 
                         we decide to ride together for a 
                         while, friendly as can be. I always 
                         figure you might as well approach 
                         life like everybody's your friend or 
                         nobody is... don't make much 
                         difference. We get out in the middle 
                         of that frying pan and suddenly 
                         everybody's pointing their gun but 
                         me. I guess they admired my horse. 
                         She's a great one, a sweet little 
                         bay.

                                     EMMETT
                         Looks like that's not all they 
                         admired.

                                     PADEN
                         Yup. The whole rig. I don't care 
                         much about the rest, but I surely 
                         will miss that bay. Least they didn't 
                         kill me. That was right considerate, 
                         I thought. They were laughing when 
                         they left me. Thought it was real 
                         funny. I walked for a little while 
                         but there was no use, so I gave it 
                         up. Figured it was just bad luck.

               Emmett comes over and fills Paden's coffee cup.

                                     EMMETT
                         Looks like those boys are headed 
                         south, so they weren't the same ones 
                         that jumped me. Which way you going?

                                     PADEN
                         Where's the pinto going?

                                     EMMETT
                         I gotta stop by Turley and meet a 
                         guy.

                                     PADEN
                         Where's Turley?

                                     EMMETT
                         South of here, past Chimayo.

                                     PADEN
                         Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. 
                         Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.

                                     EMMETT
                         Yeah, maybe a bath.

               Emmett settles down at his saddle and pulls a blanket over 
               himself. Paden glances at the rifle in its scabbard on the 
               pinto's saddle by his head.

                                     PADEN
                         Is this loaded?

               Emmett nods and closes his eyes. Paden smiles at the implied 
               trust and settles down himself.

               EXT. APPROACHING CHIMAYO - DAY

               Emmett and Paden, who is still clad only in longjohns, ride 
               toward the low, adobe settlement of Chimayo.

               EXT. ENTERING CHIMAYO - DAY

               Emmett and Paden enter the town past a cluster of teepees. 
               Three Cavalry troopers ride past them.

               EXT. STREET - CHIMAYO - DAY

               The little settlement is the center of civilization for miles 
               around. The U. S. Cavalry maintains an outpost here, and 
               there are many soldiers on the street. Emmett and Paden pull 
               up to the general store. Paden dismounts and hands his reins 
               to Emmett. Passersby look with curiosity at the undressed 
               Paden.

                                     EMMETT
                         I'll get these horses tended.

               Paden nods and looks doubtfully at the store. He scratches 
               himself. Emmett produces some money and flips Paden a coin. 
               Paden nods.

                                     PADEN
                         I'm good for it.

               Emmett rides up the street, leading the pinto. Paden starts 
               toward the store and nearly collides with a shocked woman, 
               who covers the eyes of the little girl with her and crosses 
               the street. Paden gives an apologetic tip to his non-existent 
               hat as he watches them go. Before he can turn back to the 
               store, his eye is caught by something up the street. He reacts 
               big.

               WHAT HE SEES. His horse, a good-looking bay. And, dawdling 
               his way out of a saloon, a disreputable-looking Cowboy.

               Paden's hand slaps his side, where his gun should be. He 
               grimaces and looks around desperately, then hurries into the 
               store.

               INT. STORE - DAY

               The lone CLERK is showing a woman customer a bolt of cloth 
               at the back of the store. Paden hurries in and makes a bee-
               line to the display case holding handguns and ammo. He spots 
               something he likes and taps the glass impatiently. The Clerk 
               reacts with distaste to Paden's appearance.

                                     PADEN
                         Excuse me, there --

                                     CLERK
                         I'll be with you in a moment, sir.

               Paden looks out the front window, up the street. The Cowboy 
               is untying the bay's reins.

               Paden, more agitated now, glances back at the Clerk, then 
               moves around and opens the back of the display case. He 
               extracts a shiny, new Colt .45. The Clerk reacts with alarm 
               and moves toward Paden.

                                     CLERK
                         Just a minute there, fella. When I'm 
                         done with this lady --

                                     PADEN
                         I'll take this one.

               He drops his coin on the case top.

                                     CLERK
                              (looking at coin)
                         That one's twenty dollars.

               Paden is frustrated. He leans to peer out the window again.

                                     PADEN
                         How much to borrow it?

                                     CLERK
                         These guns are for sale.

                                     PADEN
                              (indicates his coin)
                         What can I get for that?

               The Clerk gives up on putting him off and comes around the 
               display case, disgruntled.

               EXT. IN FRONT OF SALOON - DAY

               The Cowboy mounts the bay.

               INT. STORE - DAY

               Paden holds a broken-down memory of a gun as though it were 
               a cow chip.

                                     PADEN
                              (resigned)
                         What's it take?

               The Clerk holds up a box of shells.

                                     CLERK
                         This is extra.

               Paden snatches it from his grasp and heads out of the store.

                                     PADEN
                         I'll be back.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Paden hurries out into the middle of the street. Several 
               passersby stop to look at him. A teenage girl lets out a 
               delighted shriek.

               IN FRONT OF THE SALOON. The Cowboy has turned the bay into 
               the middle of the street and now looks to see what all the 
               fuss is about. When he makes out Paden standing alone, his 
               expression changes.

               Paden is having trouble extracting a shell from the ammo 
               box. He glances up the street at the Cowboy and sees that he 
               has been spotted. He shakes one shell loose and drops the 
               box, trying to insert the bullet in the gun.

               The Cowboy pulls his six-gun, leans forward, and spurs the 
               bay hard toward Paden. He raises his gun and fires at Paden. 
               There is general alarm in the street as the bystanders dive 
               for cover.

               Paden gets the shell loaded as the Cowboy bears down on him, 
               firing. The bullets kick up the dust in front and back of 
               Paden, who now raises his pistol slowly. A bullet tears 
               through the floppy material at his crotch. The Cowboy is 
               almost upon him when Paden fires. The Cowboy is knocked off 
               the horse and hits the street dead.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A big, tough Cavalry SERGEANT has been summoned by a TROOPER 
               and now walks briskly toward --

               A small crowd gathered around Paden, who is affectionately 
               stroking his reacquired horse. Two troopers flank him 
               suspiciously. The Sergeant glances at the body of the Cowboy, 
               then pushes through the crowd and confronts Paden.

                                     TROOPER
                              (indicating Paden)
                         This is the man, Sergeant. He claims 
                         the animal was stolen.

                                     SERGEANT
                         How do I know this is your horse?

               The bay nuzzles Paden.

                                     PADEN
                         Can't you see this horse loves me?

                                     SERGEANT
                         I had a gal do that to me, but that 
                         didn't make her my wife.

                                     PADEN
                         I'll tell you what, on the underside 
                         of this saddle I got my name 
                         scratched. Take a look and you'll 
                         see.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Oh, yeah, and what would your name 
                         be?

                                     SHERIFF COBB (O.S.)
                         Paden.

               The Sergeant and Paden both look to see COBB come through 
               the crowd; he is an imposing man in a duster. Paden's reaction 
               is deep and mixed, a whole chapter in his life coming back 
               at him.

                                     PADEN
                              (quietly)
                         Hello, Cobb.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Hello, Paden. How ya doing?

                                     SERGEANT
                         You know this man, Cobb?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I surely do.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to troopers)
                         Let's see that saddle.

               One of the troopers uncinches the saddle and flops it upside-
               down in the dust. "Paden" is scratched on the underside.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (satisfied)
                         All right, move along, folks. Get 
                         these children out of here.

               The crowd begins to break up. Paden and Cobb are left facing 
               one another. Cobb takes in Paden's longjohns.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I see you're prospering without me.

                                     PADEN
                         It's been a while.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Where's the dog?

               Paden's look pierces Cobb, but he bends to pick up his saddle 
               and when he straightens, there is a smile on his face.

               OMIT

               EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

               Cobb and Paden come out of the general store and start down 
               the sidewalk. Paden is a little unsteady in a pair of cheap 
               boots. A small pile of clothing is in his arms. On his head 
               is a bad-looking new hat. He catches his reflection in a 
               window and tries to give the hat a rakish tilt.

                                     PADEN
                         Appreciate the loan. I'm good for 
                         it.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Let's talk about that.
                              (a beat)
                         I'm looking for some men.

                                     PADEN
                         I've given that up.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         So have I. I've got a legitimate job 
                         now. I can use a guy like you.

                                     PADEN
                              (doubtful)
                         You've got a legitimate job.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.

                                     PADEN
                         You're right.

               Cobb stops and faces Paden.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think 
                         I finally found my place in the world.

                                     PADEN
                         Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. 
                         But I think I'll keep looking for 
                         mine.

               KYLE, a tough associate of Cobb's, hurries up to them.

                                     KYLE
                              (to Cobb)
                         He's getting out.

               Kyle goes back up the street.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (smiling)
                         C'mon, this'll interest you.

               Cobb moves off after Kyle. Paden watches a moment 
               thoughtfully, then follows.

               EXT. STOCKADE - DAY

               Kyle is digging into a saddlebag on one of three saddled 
               horses at the gate of the stockade. Trooper guards flank the 
               entrance. Cobb comes up and stares at the gate. Paden reaches 
               the end of the sidewalk and leans against a post, watching.

               The heavy gate is opened and a jailkeep steps out into the 
               sunlight; he looks back into the gloom. TYREE comes out, 
               wearing civilian clothes, shackled hand and foot. He's mean.

               The jailkeep unlocks Tyree's irons and steps back, a little 
               too quickly. Tyree nods at Cobb and a smile slits his face. 
               Kyle comes up and hands Tyree his holster. Tyree buckles it 
               on and bends to tie it to his thigh.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Look who's here, Tyree. It's our old 
                         riding buddy.

               Tyree looks up and straightens slowly at the sight of Paden. 
               No love lost. Cobb, standing between them, grins and then 
               laughs. He takes the reins of his horse from Kyle and swings 
               up.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I invited Paden to join us, but he's 
                         not having any.

               Kyle and Tyree mount up. Tyree looks down at the longjohned 
               Paden with a sneer.

                                     TYREE
                              (like a knife)
                         Where's the dog?

               The three head out of the village, passing Paden.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (to Paden)
                         You owe me thirteen bucks.

               Cobb spurs his horse and the three gallop away in the dust.

                                     PADEN
                              (to himself)
                         Thirteen... bad luck.

               EXT. RESTAURANT/SIDEWALK - DAY

               Emmett and Paden come out of a restaurant. Paden is now bathed 
               and fully dressed for the first time and he looks quite 
               different, better. The old gun he purchased is stuck in his 
               belt. Three horses -- Emmett's, the pinto, Paden's bay -- 
               are tied to the post in the street.

               Paden is fussing with his new, cheap hat. Emmett takes a 
               close look at Paden's bay.

                                     EMMETT
                         I see what you like, she's mighty 
                         pretty.

                                     PADEN
                         And bridle-wise, too. She's the only 
                         thing I lost I really cared about.
                              (he messes with his 
                              hat, disgruntled)
                         'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great 
                         one. Got a pretty silver band on it. 
                         My head spent three years training 
                         it.
                              (frowns at his new 
                              hat)
                         I surely do miss that hat.

               Emmett gives him an amused look; this sounds kind of familiar. 
               Emmett unties his two horses.

                                     EMMETT
                         I gotta be going.

                                     PADEN
                         Going to Turley, was it?

                                     EMMETT
                              (nods)
                         Gotta meet a guy and head out for 
                         Silverado.

               Paden takes the excess reins of the bay and begins idly 
               slapping them around the post, distracted. Emmett swings up 
               to his horse.

                                     PADEN
                         What's Turley like?

                                     EMMETT
                              (he doesn't make 
                              distinctions)
                         It's a town...

                                     PADEN
                         They got a saloon there?

                                     EMMETT
                         I expect.

                                     PADEN
                         Women?

                                     EMMETT
                         I expect.

               Paden takes a long time looking around the village's main 
               street. It doesn't look promising. Emmett regards him with 
               growing bemusement. Finally --

                                     EMMETT
                         Maybe you want to ride along with me 
                         as far as Turley.

               Paden lights up slightly at the suggestion. He looks up at 
               Emmett. This is how Paden makes his decisions these days. He 
               seems to be digesting it slowly.

                                     PADEN
                         Maybe... I'll ride along... as far 
                         as Turley.

               Emmett nods and turns his horses into the street. Paden mounts 
               up and follows him.

               EXT. TRIP TO TURLEY (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

               The two men, leading the pinto, make their way through desert 
               country to Turley.

               EXT. EDGE OF TURLEY - DAY

               Near the corrals at the end of the main street of the small 
               town of Turley, a small WAGON TRAIN is loosely formed up, 
               waiting. The settlers from the wagon train mill about. Several 
               regard Emmett and Paden with unusual interest as they ride 
               by on their way into town.

               One of the Settlers is a lovely young woman. She glances at 
               the two men, then returns her attention to her wagon. Both 
               Emmett and Paden notice her. She is HANNAH.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - TURLEY - DAY

               A tall gallows is being constructed in the middle of an 
               intersection. Emmett and Paden look it over as they ride 
               past. Two workmen pause in their labors and look them over.

               EXT. SALOON/HOTEL - TURLEY - DAY

               This is the busy part of town. Amidst the street traffic and 
               pedestrians sits a wagon with three Settler men, who watch 
               Emmett and Paden's arrival with enormous interest. As the 
               two travelers hitch their horses in front of the saloon, the 
               oldest man, HOBART, approaches them with some agitation.

                                     HOBART
                              (yelling)
                         Baxter, Hawley, where the hell have 
                         you been? You're late! And I'll tell 
                         you, I don't like it. It's a bad 
                         start, boys.

               Emmett and Paden exchange looks.

                                     HOBART
                         I've got my people sitting down 
                         there...
                              (indicates end of 
                              street)
                         ...swatting flies and raring to go.

                                     EMMETT
                         I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 
                         'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he 
                         ain't Hawley.

                                     HOBART
                         You're not Baxter?

                                     EMMETT
                         My name is Emmett.

                                     HOBART
                              (to Paden)
                         And you're not Baxter, either?

                                     PADEN
                         No, I'm not Hawley.

                                     HOBART
                         Well, god-dammit! God-dammit!

               Hobart turns and looks across to the other Settler men. He 
               yells.

                                     HOBART
                         They ain't Baxter and Hawley! Where 
                         the hell are Baxter and Hawley!

               All this commotion has attracted some attention and amusement 
               from passersby.

                                     BAXTER (O.S.)
                         Quit your yelling, old man. We're 
                         right here.

               Hobart looks around to find two tough-looking men on horse-
               back behind him -- BAXTER and HAWLEY.

                                     HOBART
                         Who you calling an old man?

               Baxter gets down from his horse and smiles, friendly for 
               him.

               Emmett and Paden watch with interest.

                                     BAXTER
                              (offers his hand)
                         Calm down, Mr. Hobart. I'm Nord 
                         Baxter. That there is my partner, 
                         Tom Hawley.

               Hobart takes his hand grudgingly. He's glad they showed up.

                                     HOBART
                              (gruff)
                         You're late. It's a bad start, boys.

                                     BAXTER
                              (grinning)
                         Yes, sir. We'll just have to get you 
                         people to Silverado that much quicker.

               Emmett and Paden have continued to watch. Now Hawley looks 
               over at them suspiciously.

                                     HOBART
                         All right. Let's get going.

                                     BAXTER
                         You remember my letter, don't you, 
                         Mr. Hobart? Half now and half when 
                         we get there.

                                     HOBART
                              (remembering, impatient)
                          I remember, I remember. C'mere.

               Hobart, Baxter, and Hawley move to the wagon, where the two 
               other Settlers wait. The younger of the two, CONRAD, eyes 
               the guides suspiciously. Hobart speaks to the third man, a 
               huge, bearded fellow called EB. Eb sits upon a strongbox in 
               the bed of the wagon, an awesome blunderbuss in his arms.

                                     HOBART
                         Open the box, Eb.

               Eb stands, unlatches the strongbox, and opens it, revealing 
               an impressive cache of coins and paper money. Hobart extracts 
               a pouch of coins and hands it to Baxter, who pockets it.

                                     CONRAD
                         Don't you want to count it?

                                     BAXTER
                         Not at all, friend. We trust you. 
                         Now let's get this train on its way 
                         to Silverado.

               Emmett and Paden watch the other five men head in the 
               direction of the wagon train. Paden looks over at Emmett.

               INT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

               At the back of the big room is a registration desk for the 
               hotel and stairs to the rooms. Emmett and Paden are eating 
               near a table of three Tough Men. Emmett is questioning a 
               WAITRESS, and his questions are making her nervous.

                                     EMMETT
                         ...He's about my size, energetic 
                         young fella, wears two guns in a 
                         fancy rig. He'd be a stranger here.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (moving away quickly)
                         I don't know him, I told you. I ain't 
                         seen nobody.

               Paden, munching on a biscuit, has noticed something out in 
               the street; he gets up and walks to the entrance.

               EXT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

               WHAT PADEN SEES. The wagon train is moving by. Paden's 
               attention is drawn to the seat of one of the wagons. Hannah, 
               the lovely settler woman, is there; sitting beside her in a 
               husbandly manner is Conrad. Paden is interested enough in 
               the pretty girl that he barely registers a new arrival at 
               the saloon's hitching post. The newcomer takes his saddle-
               bags and a Henry .44 rifle from his horse and comes up into 
               the saloon.

               INT. SALOON/HOTEL - DAY

               The newcomer is a lithe, strong, black man -- MAL. He has no 
               other weapon besides the rifle. Mal looks around the room 
               and walks wearily to the registration desk, although there 
               is no one behind it. He RINGS a bell for service.

               At the sound of the bell several of the patrons look up and 
               spot Mal for the first time. The three Tough Men are instantly 
               displeased at the sight of the black man. Paden, returning 
               to his meal, notes their attitude and glances over at Mal.

               Mal leaves his saddlebags at the registration desk, but takes 
               the rifle as he walks across to the bar. The nervous Waitress 
               is working there. The sight of Mal only adds to her agitation.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (cold)
                         What do you want?

                                     MAL
                              (friendly, tired)
                         I haven't had a drink of whiskey or 
                         slept in a bed for ten days. Give me 
                         a bottle.

               The Waitress hesitates, uncertain. She places a shot glass 
               and a bottle on the bar beyond an elaborate, brass, nude 
               statuette whose upraised arms hold dishes full of hard-boiled 
               eggs. Mal has leaned his rifle against the bar and must now 
               move a few steps to stand before the whiskey.

               The three Tough Men exchange looks as Mal uncorks the bottle 
               and slowly, lovingly fills his shot glass. He puts the bottle 
               down and regards the glass for a long moment of pleasant 
               anticipation. Mal's hand has started for the glass when the 
               saloon's PROPRIETOR appears from a back room.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                              (sharply)
                         Hey! What are you doing, buck?

               Mal draws his hand back and straightens slightly. A different 
               kind of weariness comes into his face.

                                     MAL
                         Having a drink.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         No, you're not. Get out of here.

               The Proprietor shoots the Waitress a withering look; she 
               shrugs helplessly and hurries away. At the tables two of the 
               three Tough Men quietly rise and separate, moving toward the 
               two ends of the bar. Emmett and Paden watch.

                                     MAL
                              (flat)
                         I haven't had a drink of whiskey or 
                         slept in a bed for ten days.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         You ain't getting them here.

                                     MAL
                              (gravely)
                         I'm real sorry to hear that.

               At this, the First Man steps forward quickly, snatches Mal's 
               rifle, and slides it down the bar. Mal looks across the 
               distance at his only weapon.

                                     PADEN
                              (quietly, to Emmett)
                         Doesn't look quite fair.

                                     EMMETT
                              (watching carefully)
                         Which way do you mean?

               The Second Man lurches up to the bar and pins Mal's arms 
               behind him. The First Man moves quickly, cocking back his 
               arm for a punch square in Mal's face. As the blow is 
               unleashed, Mal bends forward with terrific speed and force, 
               pulling the Second Man onto his back. The Second Man's face 
               is suddenly where Mal's was an instant ago, and the First 
               Man's punch lands hard on it. Mal slams the Second Man's 
               back against the edge of the bar; he falls to the floor. Mal 
               blocks a blow from the First Man and steps in with a flurry 
               of body blows.

               Back at the Tough Men's table, the Third Man pushes back his 
               chair as if to rise. Emmett has just picked up a chicken 
               leg; now he waves it ever so slightly at the Third Man: "Stay 
               out of it". The Man looks at Emmett and Paden, then settles 
               back into his seat.

               Mal sends the First Man crashing down through a table with a 
               final blow. He turns in time to see the Second Man, back on 
               his feet, grab Mal's whiskey bottle and break it against the 
               bar. Mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing 
               whiskey -- what a waste. The Second Man lunges with the sharp 
               glass. Mal lifts the heavy statuette easily with one hand 
               and uses its upraised arms to catch the Man's wrist and twist 
               the bottle painfully from his grasp. Mal's other hand hits 
               the Man once in the throat, and he is down.

               The Proprietor rises from behind the bar, a sawed-off shotgun 
               in his hand. Mal spins, swinging the statuette brutally 
               against the Proprietor's arm. The shotgun clatters to the 
               floor as the Proprietor recoils in pain, crashing into a 
               shelf of glasses. The fight is over.

               Suddenly, standing in the doorway holding a leveled gun is 
               an enormously tall figure -- SHERIFF LANGSTON. Dressed rather 
               elegantly in suit and bowler, he dwarfs the man at his side, 
               DEPUTY KERN. He surveys the scene as the three injured men 
               stir back to life. When he speaks, it is, surprisingly, with 
               a British accent --

                                     LANGSTON
                         What's all this then?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         This nigger's breaking up my place, 
                         Sheriff Langston.

                                     LANGSTON
                         I don't like that word much, Carter.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         We don't serve them here and you 
                         know it. I asked him to leave and he 
                         went crazy on us. He owes me money 
                         for this damage.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Is that a fact?

                                     EMMETT
                         'Fraid not, Sheriff. These other 
                         fellas started the ruckus.

               Langston's attention focuses on Emmett and Paden.

                                     LANGSTON
                         There are three strangers in this 
                         room, traveller, and these gents you 
                         are accusing aren't them.
                              (to Mal, indicating 
                              Emmett and Paden)
                         Are these your friends?

                                     MAL
                              (shakes his head "no")
                         I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess 
                         I came to the wrong place.

                                     LANGSTON
                              (taking in the mess)
                         Came to the wrong town. I don't 
                         tolerate this kind of thing. It's 
                         hard on the peace, and it's hard on 
                         the furniture. Now, knowing a bit 
                         about Carter here, I'm going to let 
                         you go without paying for the damages. 
                         But go you will, and I mean now.

                                     MAL
                         Is there a place in town that takes... 
                         my kind?

                                     LANGSTON
                         You misunderstand. I want you out of 
                         town. In fact, I want you all the 
                         way out of my jurisdiction.

                                     MAL
                              (seething)
                         That ain't right.

                                     LANGSTON
                         I decide what's right in this 
                         jurisdiction. Now move.

               Mal glares at Langston and, finally, moves. He takes his 
               rifle from the bar, then walks over, picks up his saddlebags, 
               and slings them over his shoulder. He is almost to the door 
               when he stops, turns, and walks slowly back to the bar. The 
               shot glass full of whiskey has miraculously survived the 
               fracas. Mal brings it to his lips and swallows with 
               satisfaction. He turns and goes out the front door. Langston 
               motions to Deputy Kern to follow and witness Mal's departure.

               Langston turns and looks at Emmett and Paden as he slowly 
               uncocks his revolver and holsters it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Who's going to pay for all this, 
                         Sheriff?

                                     LANGSTON
                         Don't press your luck, Carter.

               Langston moves to Emmett and Paden's table and pulls up a 
               chair. He lifts the last biscuit from a basket. He takes a 
               fastidious bite.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Now let's talk about you chaps.

                                     PADEN
                         We'd rather stay.

                                     LANGSTON
                         We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff 
                         John Langston. As you may have 
                         guessed, I am not from these parts.

                                     PADEN
                         You're kidding.

                                     LANGSTON
                              (ignoring that)
                         But the good citizens of Turley have 
                         taken me in their embrace, and for 
                         one simple reason. I maintain the 
                         peace. So when strangers come to 
                         town, I always ask them their 
                         business. Have you come for the 
                         hanging?

                                     EMMETT
                              ("no")
                         I'm just meeting a guy here and moving 
                         on. So far I haven't been able to 
                         find him.

                                     LANGSTON
                         In my town, when you're looking for 
                         someone, you ask me.

                                     EMMETT
                         All right. I'm looking for a young 
                         fella, full of juice. About my size, 
                         wears a fancy two-gun rig.

               Langston takes a long time reacting to this information. Now 
               he slides his chair back a foot, giving his gun hand a little 
               more room.

                                     LANGSTON
                         I know where that gentleman is.

               OMIT

               INT. CELLBLOCK - EVENING

               A lean, young man is bouncing around his cell, playing hacky 
               sack, keeping a small, leather, bean bag from falling to the 
               floor by kicking it with his bare feet. This is JAKE.

               Langston opens the door to the cellblock and speaks over his 
               shoulder to Emmett and Paden, who have removed their guns.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Now I want everyone to behave himself.

               At the sight of Emmett, Jake's face lights up. And then he 
               does an extraordinary thing: with one long stride he is across 
               the cell and into the air; he hits the bars halfway up and 
               clings like a monkey. Paden reacts as if he is one.

                                     JAKE
                         Emmett! Am I glad to see you!

                                     EMMETT
                              (touching him)
                         Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?

                                     JAKE
                         You got me. This is a crazy town, 
                         Emmett. I think we ought to get out 
                         of here.

               Jake lowers himself and darts about as he talks.

                                     JAKE
                         All I did was kiss a girl.

                                     EMMETT
                              (skeptical)
                         That's why they got you in jail?

                                     JAKE
                         Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy 
                         didn't like it and we had some words, 
                         so I decided to get out of there.

               Jake looks at Emmett as though that should make it perfectly 
               clear. Emmett waits.

                                     JAKE
                         So I did, I got out of there, I don't 
                         want no trouble. You know me.
                              (indeed, Emmett does)
                         So I walked out on the street and 
                         the fella tried to shoot me in the 
                         back.

                                     EMMETT
                         ...And you had to kill him?

                                     JAKE
                         No, no, no! I winged him, and he 
                         dropped his gun.

                                     EMMETT
                         You're in here for winging a guy?

               Paden watches, fascinated.

                                     JAKE
                         Well, no, not exactly. See then his 
                         friend opened up on me.

                                     EMMETT
                         What friend is that?

                                     JAKE
                         The one with the shotgun.

                                     LANGSTON
                         The dead one.

               There is a long moment of silence in the cellblock.

                                     EMMETT
                         Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- 
                         was it self-defense?

                                     JAKE
                              (after a moment, 
                              quieter now)
                         Honest to God, Emmett, he would've 
                         killed me.

                                     LANGSTON
                         The jury saw it differently.

                                     PADEN
                              (putting it all 
                              together)
                         So this is the guy you're going to 
                         hang?

                                     LANGSTON
                         Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.

                                     PADEN
                              (nods)
                         I was afraid of that.

               Emmett steps back and leans against the opposite wall, looking 
               down at his boots.

                                     JAKE
                         Emmett, can't you help me?

               Emmett looks up at the young man. He looks sad.

                                     EMMETT
                         Jake, you know the law. You know 
                         what they did to me.

               Jake remembers. It makes him gloomy.

                                     EMMETT
                         Blind Pete always said you'd hang.

               Jake's eyes flick over Emmett, but his expression doesn't 
               change.

                                     EMMETT
                         I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be 
                         proved right.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Ten A.M.

                                     EMMETT
                         Right... I thought they always did 
                         it at dawn.
                              (to Jake)
                         So long, kid. I'm sorry.

               Emmett walks out. Jake watches as the other two follow.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Emmett and Paden walk along the sparsely populated sidewalk. 
               They are quiet for a few moments. Finally --

                                     PADEN
                         Shame about the kid. Seems a lively 
                         sort.

                                     EMMETT
                              (morosely)
                         He is that.

                                     PADEN
                         I hate to see any man swing. Bad 
                         luck.

                                     EMMETT
                         Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust 
                         him out of there.

               Paden stops. Emmett has moved a couple more steps before he 
               notices and turns back to Paden.

                                     PADEN
                         You'll have to deal me out on that. 
                         I've had some experience with that 
                         sort of thing, and I don't want any 
                         more.

                                     EMMETT
                         I understand.

                                     PADEN
                         It's not going to be easy.

                                     EMMETT
                         It never is. But he's my brother.
                              (Paden reacts)
                         We're going to California together. 
                         But first we're going to stop in 
                         Silverado and see our sister. And I 
                         can't show up there with a story 
                         like this.

               Paden nods. He is sympathetic.

                                     PADEN
                         Then I guess this is where we part 
                         ways. Sorry.

                                     EMMETT
                         No hard feelings.

                                     PADEN
                         C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

                                     EMMETT
                         You haven't got any money.

                                     PADEN
                         All right, you buy me a drink.

               They cross the street toward the crowded, noisy saloon.

                                     PADEN
                         You know, a good smelly saloon is my 
                         favorite place in the world.

               INT. SALOON/HOTEL - NIGHT

               This is the busiest place in town, really packed. Emmett 
               heads for a spot at the bar, but Paden, who is taking in the 
               scene with relish, stops in his tracks, staring across the 
               room.

               WHAT HE SEES. Through the moving jumble of bodies and the 
               heavy smoke, Paden's hat with its silver band, floating atop 
               an unseen head at a poker table.

               Paden adjusts the old gun stuck in his belt and goes in that 
               direction.

               At the table a heavy game is in progress. An UGLY COWBOY is 
               wearing Paden's hat. Paden plants himself across the table 
               from the man. In seconds, Paden's posture brings things to a 
               halt. Quiet ripples out across the room. The Ugly Cowboy 
               looks up and recognizes Paden.

                                     PADEN
                         You're wearing my hat. What else you 
                         got that's mine?

                                     UGLY COWBOY
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about, mister.

               He shifts a little in his chair. His right hand slides off 
               the table. Bystanders back away. Emmett watches from the 
               bar.

                                     PADEN
                         I hope your hand isn't tickling my 
                         bone-handled Colt. If you stand up 
                         real slow and let me see, you might 
                         live through this night.

               The Ugly Cowboy hesitates, his eyes darting. He pushes his 
               chair back slowly and begins to rise as if in compliance. 
               But now a bone-handled Colt is in his hand, clearing his 
               holster. Paden is quicker. He snatches his gun from his belt 
               and fires.

               Paden's eyes, squinting through a cloud of gunsmoke, as we 
               hear the Ugly Cowboy's body CRASH to the floor in his chair. 
               Paden's glance now darts down at an angle.

               WHAT HE SEES. His hat lands on the saloon floor, spins once 
               on its brim, and settles into stillness like a tossed coin.

               Silence in the saloon. Then, in a far corner, the BANGING of 
               chairs and a door SLAMMING. Paden's gun points that way, but 
               there is no one there. Only an overturned chair, and an empty 
               pair of boots -- Paden's.

               Paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots. Emmett 
               moves to the dead man, unbuckles the gunbelt, and pulls it 
               free of the body. He picks up the bone-handled Colt and puts 
               it in the holster, then stops abruptly. We hear the steady 
               advance of FOOTSTEPS across the saloon floor. Emmett's eyes 
               follow the off-screen presence.

               Paden, seated, is pulling on his newly-regained boots with a 
               delighted air when a shadow surges up and engulfs him. He 
               looks up.

               Sheriff Langston towers over him.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

               Paden is brusquely deposited in the cell next to a surprised 
               Jake by Sheriff Langston and DEPUTY BLOCK.

                                     PADEN
                         You're making a big mistake.

               Langston is not interested. He and Block go out.

                                     JAKE
                         That's what I told 'em.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Deputy Block eyes Emmett, who loiters by the door as Langston 
               settles himself.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Maybe I ought to throw you in jail 
                         too. Then you could be with all your 
                         friends.

                                     EMMETT
                         I haven't done anything.

                                     LANGSTON
                         I want you out of town before the 
                         hanging.

                                     EMMETT
                         I'll be long gone.

               OMIT

               INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

               Paden forlornly regards a snoring drunk in another cell as 
               Jake talks to him.

                                     JAKE
                         You mean you ain't coming with Emmett 
                         and me?

                                     PADEN
                         I can't say I'm convinced you're 
                         going anywhere.

                                     JAKE
                         Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.

                                     PADEN
                         I've got no reason to run. It was a 
                         fair fight and there were plenty of 
                         witnesses.

                                     JAKE
                              (bubbly)
                         Yeah, that's what happened with me 
                         too.

                                     PADEN
                         The other guy drew first.

                                     JAKE
                              (same for him)
                         Right!

               Paden looks a little discouraged, but is still unconvinced.

               EXT. GALLOWS - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               Emmett sits up on the new gallows in the deserted 
               intersection, his legs dangling through the dropped trap 
               door. Now he begins idly collecting wood shavings into a 
               little pile.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

               Paden steps close to the bars that separate the cells and 
               looks up at Jake, who is dangling at arm's length from one 
               of the overhead bars in his cell.

                                     PADEN
                              (whispering)
                         Your brother seems pretty good, but 
                         it isn't going to be easy getting in 
                         here.

               Jake drops down to the floor.

                                     JAKE
                         He ain't coming in, we're going out.
                              (motions)
                         Gimme your belt.

               Paden, trying to follow this, unbuckles his belt.

                                     JAKE
                         Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?

                                     PADEN
                              (handing him the belt)
                         We didn't get that far.

                                     JAKE
                         Blind Pete taught me a great trick.

               Jake grasps Paden's belt by the buckle and snaps it at Paden 
               with a CRACK, like a lion tamer.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Deputy Block cheats at solitaire while Langston dozes at his 
               desk. Now we hear FOOTSTEPS and BANGING outside.

                                     STABLE BOY (O.S.)
                         Sheriff! Sheriff! Open up!

               Block unlocks the door as Langston comes groggily to life. A 
               STABLE BOY bounces at the door, pointing off.

                                     STABLE BOY
                         Sheriff Langston, come quick!

               He disappears. Langston goes out, calling back to Block --

                                     LANGSTON
                         Lock this door and don't let anybody 
                         in.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Langston hurries up the street after the Stable Boy.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Deputy Block bolts the front door.

                                     PADEN (O.S.)
                              (shouting)
                         Hey! What are you doing, you crazy 
                         kid? Don't do it!

               Block draws his six-gun and edges suspiciously toward the 
               door to the cellblock.

                                     PADEN (O.S.)
                         Oh, Jesus! Somebody stop him!

               Block turns the doorknob and pushes the door open with his 
               foot, gun ready. He moves into the cellblock.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - DAWN

               Block moves cautiously to where he can see the cells. A 
               strange look crosses his face.

               Jake is hanging by the neck from the overhead bars, two belts 
               forming the noose, his head at a disgusting angle from his 
               body. One foot gives a final twitch and he is still.

                                     PADEN
                         Cut him down! For God's sake, cut 
                         him down!

               Block is confused, uncertain. He doesn't want to go in there.

                                     PADEN
                         Hurry up! You might be able to save 
                         him!

                                     BLOCK
                         What for? So we can hang him?

               Paden, sincerely desperate now, looks up at Jake, whose face 
               is turning blue.

                                     PADEN
                         I think I'm going to be sick... when 
                         I see what Langston does to you when 
                         he gets here.

               Block lets it sink in, then takes some keys from his belt.

                                     BLOCK
                              (to Paden)
                         You get way back there.

               Paden moves back quickly, motioning for Block to hurry. Block 
               holsters his six-gun, opens Jake's cell door, and goes inside. 
               He gets up on the cot, pulling a knife from a sheath. He 
               strains up against Jake's body, stretching to cut the belt.

               Suddenly Jake can stand it no longer: he sputters to life, 
               his long-held breath blasting in Block's face. Block, 
               startled, stumbles backwards off the cot, raising the knife 
               threateningly. Jake grabs the overhead bars, swings up, and 
               kicks Block in the chest. The deputy careens across the cell 
               and hits the bars. He throws the knife outside the cell and 
               draws his gun, ready to shoot Jake.

               As Block's finger pulls the trigger, Paden's thumb intrudes 
               between the hammer and the firing pin. Paden has reached 
               through the bars behind Block to grasp the gun with his right 
               hand. Now with his left he grabs a handful of Block's hair 
               and slams the deputy's head hard back against the bars. As 
               Block slides unconscious to the floor, Paden keeps the gun, 
               wincingly uncocking it.

                                     PADEN
                         Got to be real quiet here.

               Jake has unhooked himself and is freeing his makeshift noose. 
               He rubs his reddened neck.

                                     JAKE
                              (a hoarse whisper)
                         Right.

               EXT. GALLOWS - DAWN

               Langston huffs to a stop next to the Stable Boy, his 
               countenance a picture of outraged befuddlement. He, the Stable 
               Boy, and just one other surprised citizen are the only 
               witnesses: the gallows is aflame, burning like a pyre.

               Langston considers this phenomenon, a suspicion slowly growing 
               in his mind.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Paden and Jake come out warily. The street is deserted. Paden 
               straps his holster on; he's glad to have it back at last. 
               Not as glad, however, as Jake, who seems to have a nearly 
               religious relationship with his rig, an elaborately tooled, 
               double gunbelt with two pearl-handled Colts.

                                     JAKE
                         That's the longest I ever did it. 
                         'Bout bust a gut.

                                     PADEN
                              (finger to lips: 
                              "quiet")
                         What now?

                                     JAKE
                         We wait.

               The two men move carefully off the porch and into the street.

               A wood stair goes up the outside of the jail to a door. Now, 
               high behind Jake, Deputy Kern comes out, nightshirt flapping, 
               cocking the carbine in his hands. He has thumped down five 
               steps before he focuses on Jake and Paden. He starts to raise 
               the carbine.

               Both men see the deputy, but Jake's reaction is so fast that 
               Paden need only watch. Jake spins and, before he has stopped, 
               both his Colts are erupting in his hands. The carbine flies 
               out of Kern's grasp and clatters down the steps. Jake 
               continues to fire -- the stair at Kern's foot splinters and 
               he steps backwards and up. Jake continues to splinter the 
               steps at Kern's feet, until he has made the deputy exactly 
               retrace his steps and retreat back through the door. The 
               firing stops.

               Paden gives Jake an odd look. Paden may have seen someone 
               this fast and good before, but he can't remember it. He puts 
               his finger to his lips -- "shhh".

                                     PADEN
                         Where's your brother?

                                     JAKE
                              (reloading fast)
                         He'll be here.

               A bullet WHIZZES between the two men as we hear shots from 
               the far end of the street. Langston is coming toward them 
               firing. They move back to the cover of the jail porch.

               ALLEY ACROSS THE STREET. Emmett roars into view, riding his 
               horse and leading two others: Paden's bay and the pinto.

               A window above the jail breaks open and Kern starts firing 
               at Emmett.

               DOWN THE STREET. Langston, behind a wagon, uses a British 
               two-handed grip to fire off a few rounds.

               Emmett brings the horses over, and Paden swings quickly up. 
               Jake focuses his attention, unleashing a fusillade as Emmett 
               leads the pinto along the front of the jail.

                                     EMMETT
                         Jake, come on!

               DOWN THE STREET. Langston lifts his head from behind the now 
               bullet-pocked wagon. He's impressed.

               Jake runs along the porch, hits the top of the hitching post 
               on the fly, and takes off, landing lightly in the saddle of 
               the pinto. The three men gallop out of town in a cloud of 
               dust.

               EXT. RIDE OUT OF TURLEY (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               The three men ride hell-for-leather away from town. At the 
               first bend they leave the road and head off cross-country, 
               their horses straining up craggy hillsides and sliding down 
               dusty slopes. There is some good riding going on here.

               EXT. THE CHASE (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               INTERCUTTING the three men and the Posse Langston has raised, 
               as the Posse closes ground over choppy terrain. Now the three 
               fugitives come through some trees along the bank of a stream 
               and splash across to the other side.

               EXT. A SPLIT IN THE TRAIL - THE CHASE CONTINUES - DAY

               The three men come thundering along a dusty trail to the 
               place where it splits. The high road disappears up the side 
               of a ridge; the low road is really the bed of an arroyo. The 
               three men exchange looks. Paden plunges into the arroyo. 
               Emmett shrugs to Jake, and the brothers follow Paden.

               INTERCUTTING. The Posse splashes across the stream. The three 
               fugitives twist their way through the crooked arroyo.

               AT THE SPLIT IN THE TRAIL. Langston pulls his group to a 
               halt. He looks at the tracks leading into the arroyo, and a 
               smile splits his face. He leads the Posse up the high road 
               fast.

               EXT. ARROYO - DAY

               IN THE ARROYO. Paden and Emmett pull up, looking back at 
               Jake, who has stopped at the last bend in the gully, watching 
               their rear. Now he rides up to the others.

                                     JAKE
                         I think we lost 'em.

                                     EMMETT
                         There's nobody coming?

               Jake shakes his head "no". Paden and Emmett exchange long 
               looks. Paden looks to the ground above them, even more 
               worried.

                                     PADEN
                         Oh-oh.

               They spur their horses out of there.

               EXT. MOUTH OF ARROYO/FLATLANDS - DAY

               The three riders break out of the arroyo and exchange looks 
               of glee on seeing the clear flatlands ahead. SHOTS ring out. 
               They look over their shoulders to see Langston's Posse, 
               practically on top of them, pouring over the lip of a rise 
               and firing at will.

               The three men whip their horses and head flat out across the 
               open space toward a cluster of boulders three hundred yards 
               away. They are vulnerable and exposed as shots PING around 
               them. They are not going to make it.

               WITH THE POSSE. Deputy Block jumps from his horse onto the 
               top of a boulder and lies prone, bracing his Winchester for 
               an accurate shot.

                                     BLOCK
                              (to himself)
                         Let's see you fake this one, kid.

               He is about to fire when suddenly the rocky surface in front 
               of his face explodes. He is so startled, he falls off the 
               boulder.

               Another Posse member is coming between two tall rocks when a 
               bullet hits near his head and ricochets into the rock on the 
               other side. His horse rears up, and the horse coming up behind 
               him collides with it.

               Langston and Deputy Kern have just started across the flats, 
               but pull up next to a cactus at this new firing. An arm of 
               the cactus is immediately severed by a .44 slug.

                                     KERN
                         Is that them shooting?

                                     LANGSTON
                              (pointing)
                         No. It's coming from those rocks.

               WHAT HE SEES. Paden, Emmett, and Jake are now halfway to the 
               cover of the distant rocks. Another shot CRACKS, and a puff 
               of smoke appears from ahead of them in the boulders.

                                     KERN
                         Let's go. He ain't hitting anything.

                                     LANGSTON
                         You idiot, he's hit everything he's 
                         aimed at.

                                     KERN
                         ...But they won't be out of our 
                         jurisdiction till they pass Flat 
                         Top!

               As Paden, Emmett, and Jake disappear among the boulders, 
               Langston rises high in his stirrups to catch a final glimpse. 
               His bowler is blown off his head. He lowers himself back to 
               his saddle.

                                     LANGSTON
                         Today my jurisdiction ends here.

               He turns his horse back. The others do likewise.

                                     LANGSTON
                              (over his shoulder, 
                              to Kern)
                          Pick up my hat.

               EXT. BOULDERS - DAY

               Emmett and Paden rein in their frothing horses in the natural 
               bowl of rocks near a tied horse and the remains of a campfire. 
               Jake has stopped short of them and taken his horse back to 
               peer out toward the Posse. Grinning, he comes back to the 
               others. The three riders bring their horses around and focus 
               on a spot above them.

               On the top of the highest boulder, Mal leaves a comfortable, 
               prone shooting position and eases himself down to a lower 
               rock. A bandolier of .44 bullets dangles from one hand. He 
               rests his Henry rifle at an angle across one shoulder.

                                     JAKE
                              (to the others)
                         This a friend of yours?

                                     PADEN
                         He is now.

                                     JAKE
                         Who is he?

                                     PADEN
                         Oh, a guy who got run out of town...

                                     EMMETT
                         ...just like us.

               EXT. HIGH DESERT - DAY

               An awesome rock spire soars into the perfect blue sky above 
               the orange desert. The sight is spectacular. The slow surge 
               of MUSIC exhilarating. It is the perfect setting in which to 
               see the four horsemen who now appear on a ridge. Here they 
               come --

               Riding together, side by side, for the first time -- Emmett, 
               Paden, Jake, and Mal.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               The travellers crest a hill above a wide desert plain and 
               pull up at the surprising sight below -- there in the 
               distance, stopped dead in a disorderly line, is the wagon 
               train we saw leave Turley. The horsemen exchange puzzled 
               looks.

               EXT. WAGON TRAIN - DESERT PLAIN - DAY

               The Settlers are clustered near a wagon as the four horsemen 
               ride down on them. There is a tense silence as they dismount 
               and approach the group. Hobart, the leader, steps forward to 
               meet them. After a long perusal --

                                     HOBART
                              (calling)
                         It's okay, Zeke.

               From the cover of a nearby wagon, Zeke appears, lowering a 
               shotgun that had been trained on the newcomers.

                                     EMMETT
                         Hobart, what are you people doing 
                         here?

                                     HOBART
                         This is where Baxter and Hawley brung 
                         us.

                                     EMMETT
                         Well, they're wrong. This territory 
                         is full of bad characters.

                                     HOBART
                         And they were two of them. Look --

               He gestures and the Settlers part to reveal the wagon which 
               held the money box in Turley. The money box is gone, but the 
               still form of its giant guardian, Eb, lies in the bed of the 
               wagon, dead.

                                     HOBART
                         Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb 
                         here and stole our money box.
                              (gestures)
                         They went north and we're going after 
                         them.

               The newcomers now see that a few of the Settler men and boys 
               are preparing to ride in pursuit. Mal and Paden exchange 
               looks, not terribly impressed.

                                     EMMETT
                         Forget the money. You've got to get 
                         these people out of here. This is no 
                         place to be sitting with women and 
                         kids.

                                     JAKE
                         Your next water ain't for three days.

                                     HOBART
                         We got no life in Silverado without 
                         that money. Everybody put in, that's 
                         our whole stake.

               Paden looks around. His gaze falls on Hannah, somber now, 
               but still lovely. Conrad, her husband, stands beside her.

               Mal has been watching a little girl cling to the leg of one 
               of the Settler men who is going out on the chase. Now the 
               black man quietly mounts his horse, and speaks to an older, 
               solid-looking man, MR. PARKER, standing by his wife.

                                     MAL
                         How long have they been gone?

                                     MR. PARKER
                         About an hour.

               Emmett and Paden watch Mal with interest. Jake is excited by 
               this development. He jumps up on his horse.

                                     JAKE
                         I'll go with you, Mal!

               Paden isn't so quick to commit, but then he notices Hannah 
               gazing up at Mal and Jake with radiant admiration. He digests 
               that and moves toward his horse.

                                     PADEN
                         Deal me in.

               He steals a look at Hannah as he mounts up. Emmett has watched 
               all this with growing resignation. Now he speaks crisply, 
               all business.

                                     EMMETT
                         Jake, you know the way out of here. 
                         I want you to get this train moving 
                         toward Silverado, and fast. I'll go 
                         with these guys.

               Jake is disappointed, but nods agreement. Emmett turns to 
               Hobart and the Settler posse.

                                     EMMETT
                         You men stay with your wagons and 
                         your families. Get rolling and keep 
                         your eyes peeled.

               Emmett moves toward his horse, as Conrad, rifle in hand, 
               steps forward belligerently.

                                     CONRAD
                         Wait a minute! If you do get the 
                         money, how do we know you'll come 
                         back?

                                     EMMETT
                              (flashes him a look)
                         If we don't, you can keep my brother.

                                     HOBART
                              (to Emmett)
                         I'm trusting you, mister.

                                     CONRAD
                              (to Hobart)
                         You trusted Baxter. I'm not letting 
                         these men out of my sight.

               As Conrad moves toward his horse, Paden looks at Hannah, now 
               standing all alone. Paden thinks he acted too quickly.

                                     EMMETT
                              (indicating Hannah)
                         If I'd brought a pretty lady like 
                         that into a place like this, I'd 
                         stay close.

               Paden reacts to Emmett's interest in Hannah.

                                     CONRAD
                         That's none of your business, mister. 
                         Let's get going.

                                     PADEN
                              (quietly, to Emmett)
                         I think you got a point, Emmett. 
                         Maybe I better stay here with her.

               Emmett smiles and snaps his reins, moving out with Mal. 
               Reluctantly, Paden follows, twisting around for a last glimpse 
               of Hannah.

               WHAT HE SEES. Hannah moves toward Conrad's horse, as if to 
               touch her husband. But Conrad, his face set in suspicion, 
               barely nods farewell as he sweeps by her. She looks after 
               him desolately.

               Mal, Paden, Emmett, and Conrad ride off to the north, as 
               Jake begins yelling orders to the Settlers to get things 
               moving. What he lacks in expertise, he makes up for in 
               enthusiasm.

               EXT. HIGH DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

               The four men track the killers across the rugged terrain. 
               Sometimes, Emmett gets down from his horse to examine the 
               tracks.

               On a flat, rocky expanse, the chase party is temporarily 
               stalled. Emmett and Paden confer, balked. Mal, peering ahead, 
               spots something and points it out to the two expert trackers: 
               a steaming horse patty. They head off in that direction.

               OMIT

               EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

               The four men crawl to the lip of the canyon and get a clear 
               view of the activity below; the box canyon has been turned 
               into a hideout for the Dawson Gang, a band of border raiders. 
               There are about twenty-five outlaws moving about among the 
               tents, caves, and wagons of the encampment. Their horses are 
               penned in a natural alcove in the rock off the main floor of 
               the canyon.

               The strongbox from the wagon train sits on the tailgate of a 
               wagon. Next to it is a large keg of whiskey from which the 
               outlaws are drawing generous portions. Baxter and Hawley 
               have brought the loot proudly back to their cohorts, and the 
               celebration is centered around this wagon.

               On the rim the pursuers exchange looks in reaction to this 
               new situation.

                                     PADEN
                              (to Emmett)
                         You know, hanging around with you is 
                         no picnic.

                                     EMMETT
                         Anybody got any ideas?

               EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - BOX CANYON - DAY

               One of the outlaws spills some whiskey onto the money in the 
               strongbox. DAWSON, the leader of the gang, angrily slams the 
               strongbox closed and kicks the offending outlaw. Suddenly, 
               there are cries of warning from the Sentinel at the entrance 
               to the box canyon. HOOFBEATS echo into the canyon from that 
               direction. The outlaws react en masse with a frightening 
               display of armed readiness.

               WHERE THE TRAIL ENTERS THE CANYON. From the shadows emerge 
               two galloping horses: on the first is Emmett, who holds the 
               reins of the second, across whose saddle is draped the 
               seemingly lifeless body of Paden. The Sentinel watches them 
               pass under the point of his carbine.

               AT THE WAGON. Emmett dismounts quickly and ties both horses 
               to a wheel. Dawson decides not to shoot this guy yet. He 
               watches as Emmett runs back across the canyon to the cover 
               of some crates and crouches down behind them, looking up at 
               the rim above the entrance. The outlaws, guns pointed, stand 
               around him.

                                     TALL OUTLAW
                              (to Dawson)
                         Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?

                                     DAWSON
                              (approaching Emmett)
                         In a minute!

               Emmett, still cowering, looks over his shoulder at Dawson. 
               He speaks now, and throughout, very fast.

                                     EMMETT
                         I wouldn't do that. You're going to 
                         need every gun when that posse gets 
                         here.

                                     DAWSON
                         Posse? What the hell you talking 
                         about?

                                     EMMETT
                         My partner and me robbed the bank in 
                         Turley and headed out with a posse 
                         on our tails. My partner there caught 
                         one a ways back, and I think he kicked 
                         off while I was looking for this 
                         damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't 
                         you? I'm Tex LaRue.
                              (offers his hand for 
                              only a second)
                         Used to ride with Ry Morris. You 
                         know him. Well, Andy Sims told me 
                         there was a hideout here, so I headed 
                         for it. Hope you don't mind.

               Paden, lying over the saddle, his face shielded by his hat, 
               winces at this story.

                                     DAWSON
                         You brought a posse to my best hideout 
                         and you want to know if I mind. 
                         Mister, I don't know any of those 
                         names and you're about to die.

                                     EMMETT
                         Wait a minute! If you don't believe 
                         me, ask them...
                              (indicates Baxter and 
                              Hawley)
                         ...they saw me and my pal in Turley 
                         before we did the job.

               Baxter and Hawley peer at Emmett and nod to each other.

                                     BAXTER
                         I saw 'em there, all right, but I 
                         don't know about any bank job.

                                     DAWSON
                         If you took the bank in Turley, 
                         where's the money?

               Emmett crouches lower, looking nervously at the rocks.

                                     EMMETT
                         I'd get down if I were you. They may 
                         be up there now.

                                     DAWSON
                              (just as he suspected)
                         No money, eh?

                                     EMMETT
                         The money's in my saddlebags over 
                         there, but I ain't stepping out to 
                         get it.

               The outlaws, all of whom are standing in the open, think 
               he's crazy. Dawson motions Hawley toward Emmett's horse. 
               Hawley is almost there when gunfire erupts from the rocks 
               above and Hawley goes down dead. Now all the outlaws hit the 
               dirt, some firing wildly. Paden unobtrusively frees his rope. 
               Dawson comes down beside Emmett.

               EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

               Conrad and Mal fire into the canyon, then move to new 
               positions.

               EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

               ABOVE THE ENTRANCE to the box canyon the Sentinel disappears 
               into the rocks, moving upward.

               AT THE CRATES. Down the line from Emmett, an outlaw gets 
               hit. The outlaws can't see anything to shoot at.

                                     EMMETT
                              (agitated)
                         If we charge them, they won't have a 
                         chance. But we gotta get to the 
                         horses.

                                     DAWSON
                         What do you mean, the horses?

               Emmett jumps up. He yells to the other outlaws.

                                     EMMETT
                         Cover me!

               He runs in a mad zig-zag toward the gate of the horses' pen.

               EXT. RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

               Mal, firing rapidly, follows Emmett's route with precision.

               EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

               Mal's shots kick up dust inches from Emmett's flying feet. 
               Once Emmett throws a glance upwards; Mal's cutting it pretty 
               close. Baxter slides in next to Dawson, who is thinking hard.

                                     BAXTER
                              (indicating Emmett)
                         Brave man.

                                     DAWSON
                         I think there's only a couple of 
                         guys up there and this asshole's one 
                         of them.

               AT THE WAGON. An outlaw is cowering beneath the wagon, but 
               doesn't notice as Paden reaches out and secures the latch on 
               the money box.

               AT THE HORSE PEN. Emmett throws open the make-shift gate and 
               runs in among the horses, yelling and waving his arms. The 
               horses begin to run out of the pen.

               AT THE CRATES. Dawson jumps up and orders his men forward. A 
               line of outlaws rushes toward the pen, all the while firing 
               up at the rim. Paden appears at a gallop from behind, pulling 
               Emmett's horse beside him. A rope stretches from his 
               saddlehorn to the strongbox bouncing along in the dirt.

               Paden comes through the line of outlaws firing and heads for 
               the pen. A few of the outlaws make the mistake of closing 
               the gap and aiming at Paden's back. The bouncing strongbox 
               knocks them head over heels.

               Emmett leaps from a rock onto his passing horse, firing behind 
               him. He and Paden go down the trail in the midst of the 
               outlaws' horses. The strongbox careens after them.

               EXT. MOUTH OF CANYON TRAIL - DAY

               Mal and Conrad, mounted; are waiting as Emmett and Paden 
               ride out of the mouth of the canyon. Beyond them, the outlaws' 
               horses scatter toward the horizon. Paden jumps off his horse 
               and picks up the strongbox.

               IN THE ROCKS ABOVE THEM the Sentinel from the outlaw camp 
               positions himself to fire at the men below.

                                     EMMETT
                              (to Mal)
                         That was some idea of yours. Next 
                         time you go in.

               Paden is tying the strongbox to his saddlehorn when there is 
               the loud CLICK of Conrad's rifle being cocked. He nervously 
               points it at the others.

                                     CONRAD
                         I knew it. Put that box on my horse.

                                     MAL
                         Mister, you got a lot to learn about 
                         people.

               A SHOT rings out. Conrad takes it in the chest and flies off 
               his horse. Now an amazing sight -- Emmett, Paden, and Mal 
               all turn and fire at once. The Sentinel is really dead.

               EXT. DESERT RISE - DAY

               Below in the distance the wagon train moves across the desert, 
               dwarfed by giant rock walls. Now, coming right PAST CAMERA, 
               at a gallop ride Emmett, Paden, Mal, and Conrad's horse with 
               his body slung over it.

               EXT. DESERT - DAY

               Hannah sits alone on the high seat of her wagon. She is 
               unaware that behind her the four horses approach. And that 
               her husband is dead.

               OMIT

               EXT. WAGON TRAIN CAMP - NIGHT

               Mal, Emmett, and Jake lounge about a campfire within the 
               quiet circle of wagons. Emmett is whittling a whistle pipe 
               out of a stick.

                                     MAL
                         After the war my family worked a 
                         little piece of land near Savannah 
                         for a while. But the way it was down 
                         there then... well, they made it 
                         hard every way they could. Finally 
                         my daddy figured the promised land 
                         was out this direction. By that time 
                         I was so sick of farming, I didn't 
                         want to touch another hoe ever. I 
                         wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy 
                         took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and 
                         my little sister headed out without 
                         me. They've got a little place south 
                         of Silverado. I guess they've done 
                         okay. Good enough anyway so that 
                         when my ma wrote me last time, she 
                         said they needed my help to work the 
                         place. That was almost nine months 
                         ago she wrote. Letter took a while 
                         to find me, but when it did, it was 
                         just the right time.

                                     EMMETT
                         Where were you?

                                     MAL
                         Chicago. Working in the slaughter-
                         houses.

                                     JAKE
                         Chicago! You been to Chicago? Was it 
                         wonderful?

                                     MAL
                              (remembering)
                          No.

               Paden walks into the light of the fire and pours himself a 
               cup of coffee.

                                     EMMETT
                         Where you been?

                                     PADEN
                              (caught, vamps)
                         Oh, I was just checking the, ah...
                              (gestures vaguely 
                              over his shoulder)
                         ...you know, lookin' in.

               He concentrates on his coffee and moves away from the light. 
               Mal, Emmett, and Jake exchange amused, knowing looks.

                                     JAKE
                         Jeez, Paden, her old man ain't even 
                         cold yet!

               Mal and Emmett laugh.

               EXT. ROLLING DESERT - DAY

               SERIES OF SHOTS as the wagon train rolls westward.

               Paden is driving Hannah's wagon; she sits beside him on the 
               seat.

                                     PADEN
                         He acted bravely out there, Hannah. 
                         Just bad luck his getting hit. Could 
                         have been any one of us.

                                     HANNAH
                         I don't believe in luck. I know what 
                         Conrad was like. Don't tell me what 
                         you think I want to hear.

                                     PADEN
                         Never will again.

                                     HANNAH
                         We got married just before this trip, 
                         so we could come out here and try 
                         the land. It's hard to find a man 
                         willing to take on a life like that.

               She pauses and takes the reins from him.

                                     HANNAH
                         Love isn't the only important thing.

               Emmett rides up on Hannah's side and keeps pace beside them, 
               smiling at the sight of the couple.

                                     EMMETT
                         How you doing, m'am? Getting enough 
                         help?

               Hannah, caught between the two men, smiles.

                                     HANNAH
                         More than enough.

                                     EMMETT
                         Have you thought at all about your 
                         plans?

                                     HANNAH
                         Some. I've been talking to the 
                         Parkers. One thing I know I'm not 
                         doing -- I'm not going back.

               OMIT

               EXT. RIVER CROSSING (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               The wagon train splashes noisily across the river, drivers 
               yelling loudly to urge on their teams. Emmett, Paden, Mal, 
               and Jake, on horseback, direct the crossing.

               EXT. APPROACHING SILVERADO - DAY

               The wagon train is moving through pretty, rolling country. 
               Mal rides up to join Emmett and Paden on point ahead of the 
               train. In his hand is a yellowed letter. He points off to 
               the south where a dramatic half-dome of rock towers above 
               the hills.

                                     MAL
                         This is it, gents. My ma told me to 
                         head south past that rock.

                                     PADEN
                         Good luck, Mal.

                                     EMMETT
                         Maybe we'll see you sometime.

                                     MAL
                              (doesn't think so)
                         Yeah... maybe. So long.

               He rides away, and he doesn't look back.

               EXT. FORK OF THE ROAD (OUTSIDE SILVERADO) - DAY

               A buckboard with a man and a young girl in it is stopped at 
               the fork, its two occupants standing up and waving excitedly.

               As the wagon train pulls to a halt, Hobart climbs down from 
               the lead wagon and is embraced by the homesteader from the 
               buckboard, BRADLEY.

               Bradley points off along the right fork of the road as he 
               speaks to Hobart.

                                     BRADLEY
                         It's right down this road aways. 
                         I'll ride in with you myself.
                              (to the girl in the 
                              buckboard)
                         Carol, go spread the word our people 
                         are here.

               The girl, CAROL, whips the buckboard into motion and 
               disappears down the road. Bradley is looking down the line 
               of wagons.

                                     BRADLEY
                         I thought there'd be more of you. 
                         But I thank the Lord for each and 
                         every one. We'll have a solid strip 
                         of bottomland under the plow when 
                         you people stake your claims.
                              (a grim look at Hobart)
                         And we're going to need every hand 
                         to hold it.

               AT HANNAH'S WAGON. Emmett has brought his horse up to face 
               Hannah and, on horseback beside her wagon, Paden.

                                     EMMETT
                         Hope to see you again, m'am.

               She nods demurely.

                                     PADEN
                         I think I'll ride along with the 
                         lady here. Just take a look at this 
                         farmland before I come into Silverado. 
                         See what makes a trip this hard worth 
                         taking.
                              (catches Emmett's 
                              amused look)
                         I'll see you around.

                                     EMMETT
                         I'll be around.

               AT THE LEAD WAGON. Hobart has what might be tears in his 
               eyes as he picks up the reins and looks at the countryside.

                                     HOBART
                         I feel like I've arrived in Canaan.

                                     BRADLEY
                         When we got here, we thought it was 
                         Eden. And it's pretty close -- right 
                         down to the serpents.

               The wagon train moves out along the right fork of the road 
               as Emmett and Jake, waving goodbye, ride straight ahead toward 
               town.

               EXT. ENTERING SILVERADO - DAY

               Silverado is a sprawling, active, handsome frontier town, a 
               cattle center and supply station for the burgeoning silver 
               mines to the west. Emmett and Jake ride into town.

               OMIT

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Mal comes around the shoulder of a hill and reins to a halt. 
               He takes the yellowed letter from his pocket and checks a 
               detail. He smiles at the stand of cottonwoods that marks his 
               route. After all these years, he's excited to be approaching 
               some kind of home. He hurries on.

               EXT. LAND OFFICE/HOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - DAY

               The land office is in the front of the first floor of the 
               Hollis home, a separate, two-story structure on a side street.

               Now we're looking down the porch as KATE HOLLIS embraces her 
               brothers, Emmett and Jake. Her big, bear-like, gentle husband, 
               J.T., comes out to add his greetings. After the laying on of 
               hands, the attention of all four is drawn to the doorway and 
               a figure we cannot yet see.

               Now he steps shyly into view: eleven-year-old AUGIE. Jake 
               makes a show of shaking Augie's hand, man to man. Emmett 
               kneels to greet him at eye level; the boy's grown a lot in 
               five years.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               Mal reaches the top of the hill, a look of high expectation 
               on his face. But now he pulls up sharply, his expression 
               changing. Not what he expected.

               Down below in a pretty, little valley that recently embraced 
               a farm are hundreds of cattle, roaming free across the last 
               remnants of the fields. And the burnt-out remains of a small 
               farmhouse.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - DAY

               Mal dismounts near the blackened timbers and walks into the 
               ruins. He looks around in a daze: he's home, but there's no 
               home there.

               EXT. KNOLL ABOVE BRADLEY'S PLACE (HOMESTEADER LAND) - DUSK

               Paden and Hannah are just reaching the top of the knoll. In 
               the distance below them is Bradley's farm, in the barnyard 
               of which the wagon train has pulled up for this first night.

                                     HANNAH
                         Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to 
                         join their parcel to mine. We'll 
                         work them together.
                              (she points)
                         Mine starts right over there. It's 
                         all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, 
                         isn't it?

                                     PADEN
                              (nods, looking at her)
                         And a pretty lady.

               She turns to face him with a clear-eyed gaze that is almost 
               scary.

                                     HANNAH
                         A lot of men have told me that. Maybe 
                         it's true. I guess some women are 
                         slow to believe it.

                                     PADEN
                         Believe it.

                                     HANNAH
                         They're drawn to me by that. But it 
                         never lasts.

                                     PADEN
                         Why?

                                     HANNAH
                         Because they don't like what I want.

                                     PADEN
                         What's that?

                                     HANNAH
                              (turns back toward 
                              her view)
                         I want to build something, make things 
                         grow. That takes hard work -- a 
                         lifetime of it. That's not why men 
                         come to a pretty woman.

               He shakes his head, agreeing, though she cannot see it.

                                     HANNAH
                         After a while, I won't be so pretty. 
                         But this land will be.

               She turns to face him again. He understands now as well as 
               she that romance is not in their future. But friendship could 
               be.

                                     PADEN
                         Hannah, don't tell me what you think 
                         I want to hear.

               Hannah laughs with him.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT

               Mal has made a fire in the remains of the fireplace and is 
               cooking food. As he sits back, he senses he is being watched. 
               He turns. There at the edge of the light stands an old black 
               man holding a Henry .44 rifle like Mal's -- his father, EZRA 
               JOHNSON. The two men look at each other a long time.

                                     MAL
                         Daddy?

                                     EZRA
                         I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae 
                         had come back to see me. But I never 
                         thought it'd be my boy. I never 
                         thought that.

               Mal goes to him and encloses him in his arms.

                                     MAL
                         Ma?

               Ezra looks up at him and shakes his head.

                                     EZRA
                         She was sick for a long time. She 
                         was sick when she wrote you, but she 
                         didn't say it. I never thought you'd 
                         come. But she did.

               Mal takes it hard. They move back to the fire together.

                                     MAL
                         Where is Rae?

                                     EZRA
                         She's gone, gone to town. She hated 
                         working on the farm...
                              (a bitter glance)
                         ...just like you.

                                     MAL
                              (gestures)
                         What happened?

                                     EZRA
                         They run me off. They burned me out. 
                         They made it so I couldn't do. Just 
                         like Georgia. If you won't sell, 
                         they take it anyway.

                                     MAL
                         Who?

                                     EZRA
                              (as though it were 
                              obvious)
                         The cattle! This valley runs down to 
                         a clear creek. That's why we picked 
                         this spot, and that's why they don't 
                         want us here.

                                     MAL
                         You own this land.

                                     EZRA
                         I paid the government for it, all 
                         right. That don't mean much out here.
                              (he motions behind 
                              him)
                         Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat 
                         in a cave in those hills. Hiding 
                         out, afraid to walk my own land.

                                     MAL
                         What about the law?

                                     EZRA
                         Whose law? The law here runs a man 
                         down -- just like these cattle.

               Mal thinks about that and grows very angry. Finally --

                                     MAL
                         That ain't right and I've had enough 
                         of what ain't right.

               INT. HOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - NIGHT

               The group is finishing dinner in the kitchen/sitting room at 
               the back of the ground floor. Augie is tooting the carved 
               whistle pipe that Emmett has given him. Kate and Emmett begin 
               to clear the dishes as Jake and J.T. continue to sit.

                                     JAKE
                         I thought running the land office 
                         would be easy work, J.T., but it 
                         sounds like what you got here ain't 
                         much fun.

                                     J.T.
                         We got a bad situation here, and 
                         those homesteaders you brought in 
                         with you are going to make it worse.
                              (indicates front of 
                              house)
                         When they come into this office to 
                         stake their claims, I think it's 
                         going to be the start of real trouble. 
                         They're going to cut McKendrick off 
                         on the north.

                                     KATE
                         J.T.'s done everything he can. I 
                         married a brave man. Augie, take 
                         that delightful gift your uncle gave 
                         you out of here while we're talking.
                              (back to others)
                         McKendrick picked the new sheriff 
                         himself, so J.T. can't even get the 
                         law enforced.

                                     J.T.
                         Half the gunslingers that drift into 
                         town turn up on our police force.

                                     EMMETT
                         A man could die of thirst before 
                         anybody offered him a drink around 
                         here.

               J.T. pulls a bottle of whiskey from a cabinet and sets up 
               three glasses, but Kate pantomimes for him to add one for 
               her.

                                     EMMETT
                         Maybe you all ought to come to 
                         California with Jake and me.
                              (across the room)
                         How 'bout it, Augie, you want to go 
                         with us?

                                     AUGIE
                         Sure!

                                     JAKE
                         You know, Augie, there are no schools 
                         in California.

                                     AUGIE
                              (aglow)
                         Really?

                                     KATE
                         Augie's going to grow up here. There's 
                         nothing wrong with the land, it's 
                         just some of the people.

                                     J.T.
                         The problem is, Emmett, you killed 
                         the wrong McKendrick.

                                     KATE
                         Why, J.T., watch what you're saying 
                         around Augie. Emmett didn't kill 
                         anybody.

                                     EMMETT
                         Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure 
                         enough, but I think you'd have to 
                         say I killed old Murdo. I think that's 
                         definitely the word.

                                     JAKE
                         It was my fault.

                                     KATE
                         It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those 
                         McKendricks don't know how to act 
                         like human beings.

                                     J.T.
                         His son is worse than he was. He's 
                         smoother, so you don't always hear 
                         him coming, but he'll do anything to 
                         keep his range free.

                                     KATE
                              (intensely)
                         I'm worried what he's going to do 
                         when he finds out you boys are back.

               Emmett puts his arm around her.

                                     EMMETT
                         I think Jake here can take care of 
                         himself. I did five years I didn't 
                         owe. McKendrick ought to be satisfied 
                         with that and let it lie.

               Kate looks between her brothers. She is not reassured.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT

               Having smothered the fire, Mal mounts up, then reaches down 
               to pull his father onto the horse behind him. They begin 
               picking their way through the cattle when two night-riding 
               cowboys, RED and SCRUFFY, approach through the gloom.

                                     RED
                         Is that you, Ezra?

                                     SCRUFFY
                              (to his mate, jovially)
                         You see pretty good, Red. Is there 
                         one or two of them?
                              (He laughs)
                         What brings you out of your hole, 
                         Johnson?

                                     RED
                         We're going to find that place one 
                         of these days. Who you got with you, 
                         Ezra?

                                     EZRA
                         This is my son. He's come home.

                                     SCRUFFY
                         Ain't that sweet, Red? I'm afraid 
                         you boys are trespassing on McKendrick 
                         land.

                                     MAL
                         You got it all wrong, mister. This 
                         is our place.

                                     RED
                         What? Mr. McKendrick bought this 
                         place from your father.

                                     EZRA
                         That's a lie.

                                     MAL
                         Tomorrow we're going to town to 
                         straighten that out once and for 
                         all. The next day we'll be back 
                         here... farming. And these cattle 
                         better be gone.

               The two cowboys are taken aback. They look to each other for 
               guidance.

                                     MAL
                         If I find any cattle on our land 
                         after tomorrow, I'm going to start 
                         carving them into steaks. And believe 
                         me, that's one thing I know about.

                                     SCRUFFY
                         Killing cattle is a hanging offense 
                         in these parts. If we shot you down 
                         right now, we'd be within our rights.

                                     MAL
                         Mister, you ever seen what a Henry 
                         rifle can do in the hands of someone 
                         who knows how to use it?

               The two cowboys tense, their gun hands flexing.

                                     SCRUFFY
                         Who would that be? You?

               Behind Mal, Ezra lowers the barrel of his own Henry toward 
               the cowboys and cocks it. He looks like a man coming back to 
               life. The two cowboys are dumbfounded. They turn and start 
               to ride away. Scruffy shouts back at them --

                                     SCRUFFY
                         This ain't the end of it!

                                     MAL
                              (to Ezra)
                         We're going to get your land back, 
                         Daddy... our land.

                                     EZRA
                              (marvelling at events)
                         Maybe we will! Maybe we will! 
                              (pause)
                         After all, I never thought I'd get 
                         my son back.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               Paden rides along the dark street, drawn irresistibly toward 
               the thinking MUSIC, lights, and hubbub of the big saloon -- 
               The Midnight Star.

               INT. MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Paden comes in and looks around with some pleasure. It's an 
               expansive place, busy now with gamblers, drinkers, and 
               brightly-dressed saloon girls. A piano player bangs away in 
               the corner. Paden has to smile. This is the way a saloon 
               ought to be. Now, even Paden is home.

               Paden walks up to stand at the bar. The BARTENDER is busy at 
               the far end of the bar. Paden is patiently waiting to get 
               his attention when he hears a woman's voice behind him, on 
               his side of the bar.

                                     STELLA (O.S.)
                         What can I do you for, stranger?

               Paden turns to face his interlocutor, but at first cannot 
               find her. After a moment, though, he looks down to see a 
               small woman in a velvet dress -- STELLA.

                                     PADEN
                         You work here?

                                     STELLA
                         I run the place. What can I get you?

               She is already moving away toward the near end of the bar. 
               He watches her disappear around the end, then sees the top 
               of her head appear behind the bar down there. As she moves 
               back toward him, she gets taller and taller, until she is 
               facing him eye to eye across the bar.

                                     PADEN
                         Bourbon.

               As she reaches under the bar and produces bottle and glass, 
               Paden leans over and peeks behind the bar. A foot-wide ramp 
               runs the length of it.

                                     PADEN
                         Nifty.

                                     STELLA
                              (smiles)
                         The world is what you make of it, 
                         friend. If it doesn't fit, you make 
                         alterations.

                                     PADEN
                         I'll drink to that. Will you join 
                         me, Miss --

                                     STELLA
                         Stella.

                                     PADEN
                         Paden.

               Stella sets up a glass for herself, and they shake hands. 
               Paden looks up at a carved ornamental star on the back wall, 
               over the words "The Midnight Star".

                                     PADEN
                         Stella... Are you the midnight star 
                         herself?

                                     STELLA
                         I am. I'm always there, but I only 
                         shine at night.

               A saloon girl -- a lovely, young, black woman -- RAE passes 
               with some drinks. Paden watches her go, then looks around 
               the room.

                                     PADEN
                         My compliments to you, Miss Stella. 
                         This is what I call a saloon.

                                     STELLA
                         Thanks. That's what I call it too.

                                     PADEN
                         And I know what I'm talking about.

                                     STELLA
                         You like a good saloon?

                                     PADEN
                         It's the only place I'm happy.

                                     STELLA
                         Me too. What's wrong with us?

               Their eyes meet for a moment, and a real connection is made.

                                     PADEN
                         You wouldn't be needing any help 
                         around here, would you? Maybe with 
                         the gambling?

                                     STELLA
                              (points)
                         You see that fellow over there in 
                         the gray coat?

               Paden nods, and now we see him too: a big man in some gambler-
               like finery -- KELLY. He is leaning over a poker game.

                                     STELLA
                         That's Kelly, my so-called partner. 
                         He runs that side.

                                     PADEN
                         So-called?

                                     STELLA
                         Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, 
                         lying cheat, he's just the man I 
                         would have picked.

                                     PADEN
                         Why'd you go into business with him?

                                     STELLA
                         I don't own this place. The man who 
                         does stuck me with Kelly.

                                     PADEN
                         Who's the owner?

                                     STELLA
                         Here he comes right now.

               Stella nods toward the door, and Paden turns to look. Cobb 
               enters through the swinging doors. He looks around with a 
               proprietary air as he walks to the bar. He is almost there 
               before his gaze settles on Paden and Stella. He stops in his 
               tracks, and a big grin splits his face.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Well, look at this! Two of my favorite 
                         people in the world, talking to each 
                         other.

               Cobb moves up and puts an arm around Paden as he shakes his 
               hand. Stella is interested in this connection, but she doesn't 
               faze easily. Paden is the surprised one.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Stella, this is one of my oldest 
                         surviving friends. Treat him right.

                                     STELLA
                         That was my plan.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (laughs)
                         Oh, yeah, you two are going to get 
                         along fine. You got a lot in common.

               Cobb looks across the room and yells.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Kelly, get over here.
                              (to Paden)
                         You didn't come all this way just to 
                         pay me back that money, did you?
                              (turns to Kelly)
                         Kelly, meet my friend Paden.

                                     KELLY
                              (cool)
                         Howdy.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Give the man a line of credit. He 
                         already owes the house thirteen bucks.

               Kelly casts a wary, appraising glance over Paden, nods, and 
               moves off.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You got a place to stay?

                                     PADEN
                         I just got to town.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Stella, we still got an extra room 
                         out back, don't we?

                                     STELLA
                         It's not in use at the moment.

               Cobb comes around the end of the bar to stand next to Stella.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         What brings you into my saloon?

                                     PADEN
                         Luck, I guess.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (cackles at this)
                         Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd 
                         changed your mind about the job.

                                     PADEN
                         You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.

               Cobb looks at Paden a long time and laughs.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         That ain't the half of it, friend.

               He turns away, taking off his coat, and hangs it on a peg 
               back there. When he turns back, rolling up his sleeves, our 
               eyes are drawn to the same thing as Paden's: a shiny, silver 
               sheriff's star.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Welcome to heaven.

               INT. CAVE - MORNING

               Mal is asleep on some hay in the small cave his father has 
               fixed up as a hideout and home. A shadow falls across him.

               Ezra stands looking at his son with loving eyes. In his hands 
               are a water bucket and his Henry rifle. Now he turns quietly 
               away.

               EXT. CAVE - MORNING

               Ezra emerges. From here, it would be impossible to tell that 
               the cave was inhabited. Except that, on this morning, Mal's 
               horse is tied nearby. Ezra looks around cautiously and moves 
               off into the rocks.

               EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING

               Ezra picks his way among the boulders warily.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

               Ezra comes out of the surrounding rocks and goes to the edge 
               of the spring. A stream runs off downhill from the pool. He 
               props the rifle against a rock and bends to drink from the 
               spring. He hears something and turns quickly. What he sees 
               makes him reach for the rifle, but the sound of several GUNS 
               COCKING freezes him inches from it.

               There are four Cowboys, McKendrick's men, emerging from their 
               hiding places. Their eyes search the surrounding rocks. 
               Scruffy and Red, the cowboys from the previous night, are 
               there, but the leader is HOYT.

                                     HOYT
                         Where's the other one, Johnson?

               Ezra is silent.

                                     HOYT
                         You couldn't leave well enough alone, 
                         could you, old man?
                              (resigned)
                         Our orders are to run you two off. 
                         If you tell us where your son is, we 
                         won't have to do any shooting.

                                     EZRA
                         You're lying, Hoyt... like always.

                                     HOYT
                         Not this time. I got my orders.

               Ezra thinks a moment, looks over at Scruffy, then back to 
               Hoyt.

                                     EZRA
                         My son's on his way to town.

                                     HOYT
                         That's too bad. You'll have to go by 
                         yourself.

               INT. CAVE - MORNING

               The distant ROAR OF GUNS echoes in the small space. Mal awakes 
               with a start. Did he dream it? He looks around.

                                     MAL
                         Daddy?

               EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING

               Mal, rifle in hand and frantic, is lost among the rocks. Now 
               he stops, listening. He hears HOOFBEATS. He scrambles to the 
               top of a boulder and looks down.

               WHAT HE SEES. The four Cowboys far below are riding away 
               from the base of the hill.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

               Mal comes out of the rocks. Ezra's rifle is no longer propped 
               where he left it. Ezra is gone. Mal rushes to the edge of 
               the spring, in agony. He looks around desperately, and then 
               freezes.

               Ezra's dead body is floating away down the mountain stream. 
               Mal splashes into the water, tripping and sliding on the 
               slippery rocks. Finally, he is able to reach Ezra. Mal sits 
               in the water and hugs his father to him.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

               Only a few customers. Early light streams in over gambling 
               tables draped with dust covers. Stella is busy behind the 
               bar. Paden and Emmett are nursing cups of coffee at a table.

                                     PADEN
                         Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but 
                         she's got a hard idea for living.

                                     EMMETT
                              (doesn't follow)
                         Yeah?

                                     PADEN
                         All I'm saying is, you won't trip 
                         over me if you look her up.

                                     EMMETT
                              (understands, but --)
                         I'm going to California with my 
                         brother.

               Cobb comes in the swinging doors, heading for the bar. Paden 
               waves him over.

                                     PADEN
                         Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. 
                         He's a friend of mine.
                              (to Emmett)
                         This is Sheriff Cobb.

                                     EMMETT
                              (shaking hands)
                         Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (interested)
                         Pleasure is mine. Always happy to 
                         meet a friend of Paden's.
                              (yelling to Stella)
                         Stella, bring Kelly out here, will 
                         you?

               Cobb turns back to Emmett with an odd smile on his face.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You're Kate Hollis' brother, aren't 
                         you?
                              (Emmett nods)
                         You're the one who killed old Murdo 
                         McKendrick.

               Paden watches as the two men let that hang between them.

                                     EMMETT
                         Didn't have much choice. He was about 
                         to shoot my brother in the back.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Can't be having that now can we?

               Stella appears with Kelly, who speaks to Cobb.

                                     KELLY
                         You wanted to see me?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         We're going to make some adjustments. 
                         I wanted you to be here when I offered 
                         Paden your job. I think he could do 
                         it without getting greedy. Stella 
                         and I are tired of you skimming our 
                         profits.

               Stella is surprised. The charge is true, but she didn't know 
               this was coming.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I'm done talking. Get out.

                                     KELLY
                         You can't do this.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (smiling)
                         Really?

               Without warning Cobb hits Kelly viciously in the stomach. 
               Stella jumps. Cobb grabs the doubled-over Kelly by the hair 
               and the belt, and propels him out of the saloon, letting go 
               before Kelly crashes through the swinging doors and into the 
               street. Cobb comes back toward the table as though nothing 
               had happened.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         How about it, Paden? You want the 
                         job?

               Paden, considering, glances at the still swinging doors.

                                     PADEN
                         I see you're an understanding boss.

               Cobb chuckles, picks up Paden's coffee cup, and takes a sip.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Nothing like that will happen between 
                         us.

                                     PADEN
                         Maybe we ought to ask Stella.

               He turns toward her. She likes the idea.

                                     STELLA
                         You'd be welcome.

               She is smiling at him warmly when suddenly her eyes shift, 
               her expression changes, and she screams --

                                     STELLA
                         No, Kelly! He'll kill you!

               Cobb is already in motion. He spins, drawing his gun, and 
               fires repeatedly at the swinging doors. Kelly has been aiming 
               over them and is blasted back into the street as the slats 
               splinter. Cobb holsters his gun. The coffee cup is still in 
               his other hand. He takes a final sip, puts the cup down, and 
               licks a spilled drop off his thumb.

               Stella is repulsed. Cobb fixes her with a malevolent look, 
               and his tone is icy --

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Thanks for warning me.

               Stella rushes out to the street, as Emmett and Paden get up. 
               Emmett and Cobb are very close for one moment.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Didn't have much choice.

               They go out through the gathering crowd.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Down the street a stagecoach is rolling into town. Cobb steps 
               off the porch to kneel beside Kelly's body. He looks across 
               at the already-kneeling Stella.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I never enjoy killing a man.

               Stella stands, so for a moment she is taller than he. She 
               stalks back into the saloon.

               The stagecoach has pulled up across the street. A tall, lanky 
               gambler has disembarked and now walks toward the saloon, 
               carrying his heavy satchel. He moves through the assembled 
               people until he is standing over Kelly's body. This is SLICK.

                                     SLICK
                         Excuse me, Sheriff. I'm a gambler 
                         who would like to run an honest game 
                         in your town. To whom do I speak 
                         about that?
                              (glances down)
                         I hope it's not this gentleman.

               Cobb likes his style. He smiles and turns to indicate Paden.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         That's him.

               Paden and Cobb exchange looks for a second. Then Cobb is 
               bustling off.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I gotta get somebody to clean up 
                         this mess.

               Emmett and Paden watch Cobb move down the street.

                                     EMMETT
                         You used to ride with that guy?

               Paden looks at Emmett, then down at Kelly.

               EXT. REAR OF HOLLIS HOME - DAY

               Jake unhitches the pinto and begins to lead it away. Suddenly, 
               Augie appears from nowhere on the back porch, jumps up to 
               the railing, and leaps out toward the pinto's back -- just 
               as Jake did in the escape from Turley. But Augie misses and 
               lands in the dirt. Jake, irritated, watches the child dust 
               himself off.

                                     JAKE
                         What're you doing? I told you to 
                         practice with a horse that's not 
                         moving.

               Jake turns and starts away. Augie runs after him.

                                     AUGIE
                         Where you going?

                                     JAKE
                         I got things to do, kid. I'm a busy 
                         man.

                                     AUGIE
                         I'll go with you.

                                     JAKE
                              (stops, looks at him)
                         A grown man can't have a little boy 
                         with him everywhere he goes.

               Jake walks away. Augie watches, then yells --

                                     AUGIE
                         Who's a grown man?

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Stella works at the spigots of some large kegs, filling empty 
               bottles with a portion of whiskey, diluting them with water, 
               and corking them. Paden comes in and watches her. She hands 
               him a bottle to cork and starts the process again as he shakes 
               it.

                                     PADEN
                         Is this a fair mix?

                                     STELLA
                         I'm saving lives here. The straight 
                         stuff would raise a blood blister on 
                         boot leather.

                                     PADEN
                         I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.

               They share a smile. Paden takes down a fancier bottle from a 
               shelf, examining the label.

                                     PADEN
                         What's this?

                                     STELLA
                         That's the good stuff.

                                     PADEN
                         Oh, yeah? How good?

               She understands him and produces two glasses with a grin.

                                     PADEN
                              (pouring the drinks)
                         Here's to the good stuff.

               Stella lifts her glass, sealing the bond.

                                     STELLA
                         May it last a long time.

               Before they can drink, the Bartender bursts in.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You better get out here.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               The room is crowded but silent, frozen. Near the middle of 
               the bar the sexy, young, saloon girl, PHOEBE, stands 
               frightened between Jake and Tyree, the mean fellow we saw 
               released at Chimayo -- now a deputy for Sheriff Cobb. The 
               two men appear about to draw.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my 
                         job.

                                     TYREE
                         Shut up.

                                     JAKE
                         I don't believe a lady has to explain 
                         anything to a man this ugly.

               Slick watches from a card table nearby, with Rae standing 
               beside him. Now his hand drops casually from the curve of 
               her rear to the vicinity of his boot.

               Paden and Stella come up on opposite sides of the bar, him 
               in front. Paden sees everything in the room: Tyree's friends, 
               Deputies Kyle and GARTH, are behind Jake and clearly poised 
               to kill him if Tyree fails.

                                     PADEN
                         What's the problem here?

                                     TYREE
                              (with venom)
                         Stay out of it, Paden.

                                     STELLA
                         He can't do that, Tyree. Cobb's hired 
                         him.

                                     TYREE
                         That's Cobb's mistake.

                                     STELLA
                         Come out of there, Phoebe. You've 
                         done enough.

               As Phoebe starts to move from between the men, Tyree grabs 
               her viciously by the arm. In the instant of that movement, 
               Paden's hand flashes out and draws Tyree's Colt out of its 
               holster from behind. Garth and Kyle tense as Tyree whirls on 
               Paden, eyes flaming. But his own gun is pointed at his chest.

                                     PADEN
                         Get out of here, Jake.

                                     JAKE
                         All I did was kiss the girl.

                                     PADEN
                         That's what you said in Turley. You 
                         remember how that ended.

                                     JAKE
                         What's the matter, Paden? You afraid 
                         I couldn't get those two behind me?

                                     PADEN
                         I don't want you getting anyone in 
                         my place.

               Jake looks at Paden, who motions him out with the gun. Jake 
               starts to move grudgingly, but first flashes Phoebe a big 
               "see you later" look. He goes out.

                                     TYREE
                              (to Paden)
                         I should have killed you a long time 
                         ago.

               Paden flips the gun in his grasp and hands it to Tyree, butt 
               first.

                                     PADEN
                         Why not now?

               The situation is now totally reversed, and no one can quite 
               believe it. Tyree cocks the gun. At the poker table Slick 
               lifts his pant leg, revealing the handle of a custom-made 
               dagger secreted in his boot.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't do it, Tyree. I just lost a 
                         partner. If you kill him, I'll never 
                         get anyone to work here.

               Tyree considers for a moment, then holsters his gun. To Stella --

                                     TYREE
                         Better start looking.

               He goes out. Garth and Kyle follow. Phoebe hurries away from 
               Stella's hard look. Slick relaxes. The piano kicks in. Paden 
               leans against the bar toward Stella.

                                     STELLA
                         You really are a gambler.

                                     PADEN
                         Give me some of the good stuff.

               EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - DAY

               A door opens on the upstairs porch and Rae emerges, giggling 
               and buttoning her dress. A hand reaches out and pulls her 
               back inside for another squealing embrace. She pushes herself 
               free and comes outside again, then starts down the exterior 
               stairs. She is almost to the bottom when she stops suddenly.

               Mal stands at the bottom of the stairs. They look at each 
               other a long time. Conflicting emotions race across Rae's 
               face, but the winner is cold anger.

                                     MAL
                         Hello, Rae.

                                     RAE
                         What are you doing here? I thought 
                         you were done with our family.

                                     MAL
                         Daddy's dead.

               Rae seems to sway, then sits down on the stairs above Mal. 
               For a moment she is somewhere else, but when she returns, 
               her look is as hard as before.

                                     MAL
                         He was murdered.

                                     RAE
                         Who did it?

                                     MAL
                         I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And 
                         when I am sure, they're going to 
                         pay.

                                     RAE
                              (bitter)
                         Oh that's just fine. Where were you 
                         when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's 
                         too late, Mal. Now you finally show 
                         up and all you can think of is to 
                         get yourself killed.

               Now Slick comes down the stairs behind Rae, pulling on his 
               jacket. Mal glares at him; this is who can buy his sister 
               now.

                                     SLICK
                         Are you all right, Rae?

                                     RAE
                         Yeah, I'm okay.

               Slick seems unperturbed by Mal's glare. To Rae --

                                     SLICK
                         Will you introduce me to your friend?

                                     RAE
                         He's not my friend. He used to be my 
                         brother.

                                     SLICK
                              (offers his hand to 
                              Mal)
                         Calvin Stanhope... but my mother 
                         called me Slick.

               Mal just looks at the proffered hand. Slick retracts it 
               without offense.

                                     SLICK
                         I know what you're thinking, mister, 
                         but I think Rae's a special lady. 
                         Excuse me.

               Slick comes down past Mal and moves off. Mal watches him go, 
               then turns to Rae.

                                     MAL
                         What are you doing here, Rae? This 
                         ain't for you.

                                     RAE
                         It's none of your business.

                                     MAL
                         Rae, all we got is each other.

                                     RAE
                              (standing up)
                         I don't have any family any more.

               She brushes past him and is gone.

               OMIT

               EXT. BRADLEY'S PLACE - NIGHT

               Carol, Bradley's daughter, and a Friend are playing on the 
               roof of the farmhouse, above the noisy activity of the 
               welcoming celebration. Now Bradley steps into the foreground.

                                     BRADLEY
                         Don't fall off of there, you fools!

                                     HOBART
                         Might do them some good, Daniel. I 
                         wasn't worth a damn until I fell off 
                         the barn on my head.

               The two men turn to look at the dancing. It's a festive scene 
               all around: tables are laden with food near a large bonfire, 
               a few of the covered wagons are pulled up nearby, children 
               dart about before the pick-up band of musicians.

               Now we see, here among the sodbusters, whirling by with a 
               comely lass, Jake, looking mighty slim without his double 
               gunbelt. He and his partner glide by Emmett, who stands 
               shouting over the din with Hannah and Mr. and MRS. PARKER.

                                     MRS. PARKER
                         Hannah's the hardest-working gal I 
                         ever saw.

                                     MR. PARKER
                         It's going to be all right.

                                     EMMETT
                         I wish you the best, Mrs. Parker.

               Mr. Parker twirls his wife off into the dance. Emmett and 
               Hannah, a slightly awkward couple, stroll away from the music. 
               This is the first time Emmett has seemed less than certain.

                                     EMMETT
                         The Parkers seem like nice folks.

                                     HANNAH
                         They've been kind to me.

                                     EMMETT
                              (after a few steps)
                         Paden sends his best.

                                     HANNAH
                              (smiles)
                         I guess I put a good scare into him.

               Emmett smiles in agreement.

                                     HANNAH
                         I'm surprised to see you out here 
                         tonight.

                                     EMMETT
                         I just came out to say goodbye.

                                     HANNAH
                              (stopped)
                         Goodbye?

                                     EMMETT
                         Yeah, me and Jake will be heading 
                         out for California soon.

               Hannah is silent for a moment. She sits down at one of the 
               tables and looks at him. For the first time there is a 
               softness in her voice.

                                     HANNAH
                         You came all the way out here to 
                         tell me you're going to California? 
                         All you had to do was go, and we'd 
                         never see each other again.

                                     EMMETT
                         That's why I'm here.

               She gives him an odd look, a soft challenge to his reticence.

                                     HANNAH
                         Why?

               He sits down beside her and looks at his boots.

                                     EMMETT
                         You don't make it easy on a fellow.

                                     HANNAH
                         Didn't Paden tell you that?

               Emmett smiles at that and looks into her lovely eyes. After 
               a long moment --

                                     HANNAH
                         Maybe you thought you'd be back this 
                         way someday.

                                     EMMETT
                         Yeah... that must have been it.

               UP ON THE ROOF of the farmhouse, Carol is yelling and 
               gesturing to her oblivious father below, while her Friend 
               stares frozen into the night.

               Jake is wiping his brow as he stands at the edge of the 
               dancers. He looks up at Carol quizzically.

               Only now do we hear it, over the din of the music: the THUNDER 
               of hooves. Out of the night, streaming around the farm 
               buildings, comes a horde of masked Cowboys, McKendrick's 
               men. They send up a horrible yell and begin firing their 
               weapons in the air.

               Their arrival is so sudden that the celebrants are frozen in 
               their places, mothers hugging children to them, men far from 
               their weapons. There are SCREAMS.

               Emmett grabs a panicked child from the path of the horses 
               and moves back, passing her to Hannah. He's trying to gauge 
               his response in the midst of all these innocents.

               Two Cowboys have roped opposite ends of a section of fence 
               and now pull the deadly drag, already thick with ravaged 
               corn, through the barnyard, knocking over everything in its 
               path.

               Jake slides through the chaos toward his gunbelt, hung on a 
               peg on the barn wall.

               A Cowboy pulls the gate from the pigsty, and the pigs squeal 
               out. Another Cowboy begins shooting them with a Henry rifle. 
               On the roof, Carol looks in horror at the death of her prize 
               sow.

               Emmett is herding as many Settlers as he can toward the cover 
               of the barn.

               Bradley edges toward the door of his farmhouse.

               Hobart is urging some women between two wagons. A Cowboy 
               rides by and kicks him viciously.

               Hoyt pulls up, looks around, then gestures to some of his 
               men. Two Cowboys with prepared torches in their hands ride 
               up to the bonfire and swing low, lighting their firebrands. 
               One moves ahead toward the farmhouse, reins his horse, and 
               heaves the torch high in the air toward the roof on which 
               the two children perch.

               In the air, the tumbling flame suddenly explodes at the ROAR 
               of a shotgun. Sparks shower harmlessly to the ground.

               Bradley has shot it out of the air with one barrel of his 
               shotgun. The blast has created a momentary, shocked lull in 
               the attack. Bradley looks wild.

               Emmett watches, fearful. His hand is on his gun.

               Hoyt looks at Bradley. Bradley swings the shotgun around 
               toward the other torch-bearer.

               The Cowboy who tossed the first torch shoots Bradley dead. 
               Carol screams.

               Emmett looks across the yard at Jake, who steps out from the 
               cowering homesteaders, a gun in each hand. Emmett draws and 
               kills the man who shot Bradley. Now all the Settlers hit the 
               dirt.

               Jake fires from both hands repeatedly. One Cowboy dies and 
               another takes it in the arm. The man who was shooting the 
               pigs swings his rifle around toward Jake, and Emmett kills 
               him with one shot.

               Hoyt reacts big to the presence of deadly wolves in the midst 
               of these sheep. He peers through the tumult, trying to see 
               their faces. His Cowboys are shooting wildly into the crowd 
               now, but he rides through them, signalling a retreat.

               Emmett jumps from the top of a fence to the roof of the house, 
               the Henry rifle in his hand. He scrambles to the peak of the 
               roof, where the two children still cower. Bracing the rifle 
               on the chimney, he takes careful aim. Once... twice... he 
               fires. One Cowboy dead, one wounded and fleeing.

               Hannah runs up to the riderless horse of a fallen Cowboy and 
               pulls a rifle from its scabbard. She cocks it and fires off 
               at the retreating Cowboys. Jake mounts a horse Pony Express-
               style and rides out of the barnyard.

               OMIT

               EXT. BRADLEY'S PLACE - NIGHT

               LATER. Emmett lowers a weeping Carol to the ground. The girl 
               rushes toward her fallen father and her mother, who cradles 
               the body. Hobart intercepts the girl, trying to shield her 
               from the sight. Emmett's eyes meet Hobart's. Hobart lets 
               Carol go.

               Emmett walks through the devastation to where Hannah stands 
               dazed, rifle still in hand. Emmett puts his arm around her. 
               She jumps at his touch, then moves against him. Jake rides 
               into the barnyard and up to Emmett. He is flushed.

                                     JAKE
                         There's two more out there walking 
                         home, if they can walk.

               Emmett's gaze is caught by something across the barnyard. 
               Hannah follows his gaze.

               Mr. Parker stumbles out of the darkness at the side of the 
               barn, sobbing. Hannah breaks from Emmett and rushes to Mr. 
               Parker. When she is beside him, she freezes, staring into 
               the shadows.

               Emmett watches.

               EXT. ALLEY/STREET - SILVERADO - DAY

               Augie is standing circus-style on the saddle of the pinto as 
               he rides down the alley. As he approaches the main street, 
               his foot slips, and he bumps down hard into the saddle. The 
               horse is barely in his control as he bounces out into the 
               busier thoroughfare, and into the path of -- An imposing 
               phalanx of four horsemen: Hoyt, Scruffy, SWANN, and their 
               boss, ETHAN MCKENDRICK. The pinto shies as the horsemen pull 
               up abruptly.

                                     AUGIE
                         Sorry 'bout that.

               Swann looks with interest at the pinto, then reaches out and 
               grabs the reins from Augie's hand.

                                     AUGIE
                         Hey!

                                     SWANN
                         Where'd you get this horse, kid?

                                     AUGIE
                         This is my uncle's horse.

                                     SWANN
                         The hell it is.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                              (irritable)
                         What's the problem, Swann?

               Emmett steps off the sidewalk on the other side of the street 
               and approaches the group, his eyes on McKendrick.

                                     EMMETT
                         Yeah, what's the problem?

               McKendrick turns at the sound of Emmett's voice. Something 
               powerful flicks through his eyes, but not too many people 
               would see it.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Emmett.

                                     EMMETT
                         McKendrick.

               Hoyt eyes Emmett, who seems familiar. Emmett looks at Swann 
               in such a way that Swann releases the reins of the pinto.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         I didn't know you were out.

                                     EMMETT
                         Did it seem short to you?

               McKendrick reacts to Emmett's tone.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         That's all over as far as I'm 
                         concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.

                                     EMMETT
                         Sounds good.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         All right then.
                              (to his men)
                         Let's go.

                                     SWANN
                         Mr. McKendrick, don't you recognize 
                         that pinto?

                                     MCKENDRICK
                              (doesn't)
                         What?

                                     SWANN
                         That's Lee's horse.

                                     HOYT
                         Shut up, Swann.

               Now McKendrick understands. He avoids Emmett's gaze and speaks 
               to Swann.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Forget it.

                                     EMMETT
                         Wait a minute. Get down off of there, 
                         Augie.

               Augie hops down as Emmett takes the reins. Emmett gives Augie 
               a look and a small nod, and the boy steps away.

               Emmett looks once again at the distinctive brand on the 
               pinto's flank, a circle with two wavy lines beneath it. Now 
               he leads the pinto around beside McKendrick's horse so he 
               can see the brand on that animal. McKendrick has to twist in 
               his saddle to watch Emmett. The brands are the same. Emmett 
               looks up at McKendrick. Things are clear between them.

                                     EMMETT
                         The man who lost this horse must 
                         have been working for you. I should 
                         have known. But you changed your 
                         brand, Ethan.

               McKendrick's tone is different now --

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         A lot of things changed when my father 
                         died.

               Emmett lays the reins of the pinto across the front of 
               McKendrick's saddle, but they might just as well be a 
               gauntlet. McKendrick picks them up. He and his men move down 
               the street. Emmett walks over and takes Augie beneath his 
               arm.

               DOWN THE STREET. Hoyt rides close to McKendrick but looks 
               back over his shoulder.

                                     HOYT
                         Mr. McKendrick, he was one of them 
                         last night at Bradley's.

               McKendrick reacts: more bad news.

               INT. LAND OFFICE - DAY

               J.T. supervises the newly-arrived Settlers as they file their 
               homestead claims. There is a battle-weary but resolved air 
               to the group after the night attack. They are going to stick 
               it out. The last step in the filing process is to sign in a 
               large register. Mr. Parker signs and moves away. Hannah steps 
               up for her turn. Her face is a little harder today, but her 
               hand is steady.

               EXT. LAND OFFICE/HOLLIS HOUSE - DAY

               Several of the Settlers' wagons are here, guarded by vigilant, 
               armed men. Their attitude has become more wary, siege-like. 
               Parker climbs onto a wagon. Hannah is about to follow when 
               Emmett approaches with Augie, who runs off around the house. 
               Several of the Settlers greet Emmett warmly. Emmett looks 
               closely at Hannah's face.

                                     EMMETT
                         Are you all right?

                                     HANNAH
                         This is a brutal land.

                                     EMMETT
                         You must have known that before you 
                         came.

                                     HANNAH
                         It's one thing to know it...

               She looks off, then bitterly --

                                     HANNAH
                         We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.
                              (with an edge)
                         He said he'd... look into it.
                              (Emmett understands)
                         I can't believe he's the law out 
                         here. Now I see why you all wear 
                         guns.

                                     EMMETT
                         How's Mr. Parker doing?

                                     HANNAH
                         Just like you'd think. But he's not 
                         going to run. We're sticking to our 
                         plan. Now we both need help.

               Emmett looks her over. He's not liking her any less.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO JAIL - DAY

               Cobb sits with his boots up on his desk. McKendrick sits in 
               the shadows across the room.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         He must be pretty good.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         He's good, all right. Too good for 
                         my men. That's why you've got to 
                         take care of it.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         What about his brother?

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         We'll handle that. He's careless.

               Cobb looks out the window.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Things are getting messy around here.
                              (he looks at McKendrick)
                         I hear Ezra Johnson got himself 
                         killed.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         I heard that too.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Did you hear his son is still around?

               McKendrick reacts to that, and Cobb can't suppress a smile. 
               McKendrick sees it and stands up.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Cobb, looks like you're finally going 
                         to earn your money.

               INT. OFFICE - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Stella and Cobb have been dividing the receipts between them. 
               Cobb puts another sum in a leather pouch.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         This'll be for Paden.

               Stella is impressed by the amount. Cobb notes her reaction.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         It's an advance. We want him to know 
                         he's going to be happy here.

                                     STELLA
                         I wouldn't worry about that.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I thought you two would get along.

               Cobb opens the office door and holds it for Stella.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Cobb and Stella come out into the saloon, which is not yet 
               crowded. Stella moves up her ramp behind the bar as Cobb 
               walks along in front of it.

                                     STELLA
                         From what I've seen, Paden doesn't 
                         care much about money.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         He says he doesn't care about 
                         anything, but he does. There's just 
                         no telling what it's going to be.

               Slick is standing at the bar. Cobb settles in next to him. 
               They nod at each other.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Howdy, Mr. Slick.

                                     SLICK
                         Sheriff.

               Cobb turns to Stella, who has put a bottle before him and is 
               pouring Cobb and herself drinks. Cobb seems to be including 
               Slick in the following story, though he addresses Stella.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Let me tell you about your friend 
                         Paden. Me and him and Tyree and a 
                         few other boys did a good bit of 
                         riding together a few years back. 
                         Business, you know, and business was 
                         pretty good. We were moving around a 
                         lot, the way you have to in that 
                         work, and somewhere along the line 
                         we picked up this dog. One of the 
                         boys took to feeding it, so it 
                         followed us everywhere. Anyway, this 
                         one time we were leaving a little 
                         Missouri town in quite a hurry, with 
                         a bunch of the locals on our tails. 
                         The dog somehow got tangled up with 
                         Tyree's horse and Tyree went flying. 
                         Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped 
                         up, so he shot the dog. Didn't kill 
                         him, though. Before you know it, 
                         Paden's off his horse and holding 
                         the dog. He'd gone all strange on 
                         us. Said we should go on without 
                         him. I thought he was kidding at 
                         first. But he wasn't. Tyree was ready 
                         to plug 'em both. And all this with 
                         the posse coming down on us. Here I 
                         thought we were pals after all that 
                         riding. And suddenly he's more worried 
                         about a mutt. So we did like he asked 
                         and left him. He went to jail for a 
                         dog.

               Stella has been listening intently. Now her glance shifts: 
               Paden has walked up beside Cobb. Cobb lifts his glass to 
               Paden with a grin, but speaks to Stella.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         And you want to hear the funny part? 
                         Paden didn't even like the damn dog.

               Paden gives Cobb an odd glance but smiles.

                                     PADEN
                         It evened out in the end. They locked 
                         me up, but the dog sprung me.

               Cobb and Slick laugh, but Stella just watches Paden.

                                     STELLA
                         Where's the dog now?

                                     PADEN
                         He left me.

               Cobb takes the bottle and a couple glasses.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         C'mon, Paden, I'll buy you a drink.

               Cobb leads Paden to a table in the corner. As Paden sits 
               down, Cobb drops the pouch on the table. Paden glances at 
               the contents as Cobb pours the drinks.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I took out thirteen dollars.

                                     PADEN
                         This is a lot of money.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I told you this was a sweet set-up.

                                     PADEN
                         It is that.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Maybe you could run it without Stella.

               Paden looks sharply at Cobb. With some heat --

                                     PADEN
                         This is her life. I'll go before she 
                         does.

               Cobb is amused but not surprised.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Easy, boy. Just an idea.

                                     PADEN
                         Well, thanks, but forget it.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You know, Paden, what makes all this 
                         work is me doing my job. The fellows 
                         you came to town with are causing 
                         some trouble. It's going to take a 
                         little straightening out. I have my 
                         responsibilities. I want you to 
                         understand. It has nothing to do 
                         with us.

               Paden looks at Cobb a long time, then at his drink.

                                     PADEN
                         What is it you want from me?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between 
                         us.

                                     PADEN
                         I'm a great believer in doing nothing.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         So we understand each other?

                                     PADEN
                         Don't worry about me. If you're taking 
                         on Emmett, the last place I want to 
                         be is between you.

               EXT. ARROYO - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY

               We move along the burnished barrel of the old Henry .44 rifle 
               to Emmett's eye, sighting along its length.

               Now we see his target. In the distance is a small cactus 
               plant. Emmett squeezes off a shot. The cactus does not move. 
               He aims again and fires quickly. Again, nothing at the cactus.

               AT THE CACTUS. Now we're right behind the target plant, Emmett 
               in the distance. When he fires, a thin needle at the top 
               edge of the plant is blown away, the bullet leaving a shallow 
               trough in the green skin. He fires again, and the next needle 
               disappears. Now there are four troughs. He's been hitting 
               from the start.

               Emmett lowers the rifle, walks back to his horse tied nearby, 
               and leaves the rifle, then moves away from the horse again.

               He stops, looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away. He 
               shakes the fingers of his gun hand once, then very quickly: 
               he draws his Colt and fires. The can jumps into the air. 
               While it is still moving, Emmett holsters the gun, releasing 
               it, then draws again and fires. As the can jumps once more, 
               Emmett repeats the action. Six times he draws. The can doesn't 
               stop moving until after the last shot.

               The horrible NOISE echoes away as Emmett holds the empty gun 
               before him. From behind a rock ahead of him, Deputy Garth 
               appears.

                                     GARTH
                         You're empty, mister.

               Emmett immediately begins to bolt toward his horse. A lasso 
               settles around his arms and whips him viciously backwards. 
               In a second he is back on his feet and running like a bull 
               toward Deputy Kyle, who has stepped from the brush to throw 
               the rope. Immediately a second lasso catches Emmett from the 
               other side and pulls taut. A deputy on horseback, CHARLIE, 
               has roped him. Charlie and Kyle pull their ropes, yanking 
               Emmett onto his back.

               Now appearing around a bend in the arroyo is Tyree, a nasty 
               glint in his eye. He rides hard directly toward Emmett. Emmett 
               watches the pounding hooves approach. He struggles but can't 
               move. Tyree's horse thunders over him, one hoof catching his 
               side with a sickening THUD. Emmett writhes in agony.

               Tyree turns his horse and heads back. Kyle pulls harder on 
               his rope. Tyree rides over Emmett again, but we can't see 
               the damage for the dust. Tyree walks his horse over and looks 
               down, as Garth, Kyle, and Charlie converge.

               Emmett's head is bleeding, his body crumpled. But he looks 
               up at them through pain-squinted eyes.

                                     GARTH
                         Ain't you dead yet, mister?

                                     TYREE
                         Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.

               They all laugh at this.

                                     TYREE
                              (to Emmett)
                         Guess you couldn't hear us coming.
                              (to the others)
                         He was practicing so hard for a fight, 
                         he missed the whole thing.

               The others cackle. Garth draws his gun.

                                     GARTH
                         So long, stranger.

               He starts to lower the muzzle toward Emmett. There is the 
               echoing CRACK of a shot and the gun flies from Garth's 
               shattered hand.

               Mal stands on a rock above them, his rifle pointed.

                                     MAL
                         I don't want to kill you, and you 
                         don't want to be dead. Drop your 
                         guns.

               The other deputies exchange glances as Garth bends in pain.

                                     KYLE
                         He can't be that good, Tyree.

                                     TYREE
                         Do you want to find out?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (dropping his rope)
                         I think we should do like he says.

               As the others start to unbuckle their holsters, Charlie, the 
               compliant one, draws on Mal. Mal shoots him out of the saddle, 
               dead. The others freeze.

               EXT. TRAIL - BASE OF HILLS - DAY

               Mal comes into view, leading a motley remuda. Emmett is tied 
               onto his horse, unconscious. The four deputies' riderless 
               horses are strung along behind. All their guns have been 
               tied on Emmett's horse. Now Mal releases the extra horses 
               and shoos them away. He leads Emmett's horse up the trail 
               into the hills.

               EXT. CAVE - DAY

               Emmett and Mal's horses are tied near the entrance.

               INT. CAVE - DAY

               Mal has tended to Emmett's head wound and now binds a large, 
               ugly bruise on his ribs. Emmett, half-conscious, writhes in 
               pain, and now his eyes flicker open. Confused, he makes a 
               futile attempt to rise.

                                     EMMETT
                         ...Gotta go...

                                     MAL
                         Sure.

               Emmett passes out again.

               EXT. ROAD - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DUSK

               The three surviving deputies, gunless, trudge along the road. 
               Garth holds his wounded hand close to his body.

               INT. CAVE - DUSK

               Emmett lies sleeping in the flickering light of the fire. 
               Mal sits nearby, his Henry rifle lying at his feet. He is 
               examining the Henry that Emmett had at the arroyo. Emmett 
               wakes up, wincing.

                                     EMMETT
                         Where are we?

                                     MAL
                         Someplace safe. How you feeling?

               Emmett's look makes it clear -- "bad".

                                     EMMETT
                         I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

                                     MAL
                         I didn't just come along. I was 
                         looking for you.
                              (Emmett doesn't 
                              understand)
                         Jake said you were out there. I saw 
                         him in town, and he told me about 
                         that business the other night. Said 
                         you boys took a Henry off one of 
                         McKendrick's men. I wanted to see 
                         it.

                                     EMMETT
                         That's it.

               Mal looks at the rifle in his arms sadly.

                                     MAL
                         This was my father's. The men who 
                         killed him took it.

                                     EMMETT
                              (looks at him a moment)
                         I'm sorry.

               Emmett tries to move his pain-racked body.

                                     EMMETT
                         I gotta get to my brother. If they 
                         came after me, they'll want him too.

                                     MAL
                         You'll never make it.

                                     EMMETT
                              (still trying)
                         Have to.

               Mal reaches out with a strong hand and eases Emmett back 
               down.

                                     MAL
                         I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.

                                     EMMETT
                              (after a long look)
                         Be careful. You're in it now. And 
                         it's gonna get mean.

                                     MAL
                         So far that's all I seen in this 
                         life.

               EXT./INT. LIVERY STABLE - EDGE OF TOWN - DUSK

               It's quiet here, nobody around. We move up to the hay-loading 
               window at the loft level. Now Jake dives into view, leaping 
               from the hayloft to a beam and flipping completely around 
               it. We hear GIGGLES. Phoebe climbs the ladder onto the loft 
               and looks in wonder at her manic companion, who now flies 
               back onto the loft. They look at each other with hungry 
               anticipation.

               EXT. ALLEY/STREET NEAR HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mal, on foot, makes his way cautiously through the gloom to 
               the end of the alley. He looks over at the Hollis home and 
               land office, windows aglow. Now Mal spots a Cowboy down the 
               street smoking a cigarette as he leans against a hitching 
               post. Mal is peering at him uncertainly when the front door 
               of the Hollis house opens, and Kate steps out onto the porch. 
               The Cowboy steps quickly back into the shadows, and Mal notes 
               it.

               Kate vigorously shakes a tablecloth over the railing and 
               turns back inside, talking as she goes.

                                     KATE
                         Augie, I've had enough of this. Kiss 
                         your father and get in bed.

               She closes the door behind her. Mal sees the cowboy called 
               Red coming down the street and hurries away in the direction 
               he came from.

               Red comes up to the WATCHING COWBOY.

                                     RED
                         No sign of him yet?
                              ("no")
                         He ain't at the saloon either.

                                     WATCHING COWBOY
                         Where is that boy?

               INT. RAE'S ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR (SECOND FLOOR) - NIGHT

               Rae is finishing her evening's makeup in the cracked mirror 
               of her cramped, little room. Mal slides in the door behind 
               her, closing it quickly. He carries his rifle. She sees his 
               reflection and stiffens but continues making up.

                                     RAE
                         Get out. We have nothing to talk 
                         about.

                                     MAL
                         Rae, I need help.

                                     RAE
                         Why come to me?

                                     MAL
                         Because you're my sister. There's 
                         nobody else.
                              (a beat)
                         The men who killed Daddy are after 
                         Jake. I gotta talk to him.

                                     RAE
                         What's stopping you?

                                     MAL
                         They're watching the Hollis place. I 
                         can't get through.

                                     RAE
                         What makes you think I could?

                                     MAL
                         Why would they stop you?

                                     RAE
                              (bitter irony)
                         Because I'm your sister.

               Mal sits down on her bed. She looks at him a moment.

                                     RAE
                         Wait here.

               INT. SALOON - NIGHT

               Stella is working behind the bar. Slick is playing poker at 
               a table nearby. Now Rae appears and whispers in his ear. He 
               throws in his cards, gets up, and follows her toward the 
               stairs. Stella watches.

               INT. RAE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Mal looks up as the door opens, then stands up when he sees 
               that Rae has brought Slick with her.

                                     MAL
                         Why him?

                                     RAE
                         Shut up. You need help, don't you?

               EXT. CHURCH - SILVERADO - NIGHT

               We are looking up at the church steeple from across the 
               square. Now Slick steps into the foreground, looks around, 
               and waves someone on from behind. Mal comes into the frame.

                                     SLICK
                              (quietly)
                         Jake said he'd meet you behind the 
                         church. Be careful. They're all over 
                         the place.

               Mal's opinion of Slick has softened. He offers his hand.

                                     MAL
                         Thanks.

                                     SLICK
                              (shakes hands)
                         Good luck.

               Mal looks around, then slips away toward the church. Slick 
               stands and watches.

               EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - NIGHT

               Mal comes around the corner of the building. Cobb is lounging 
               comfortably on the back steps. Mal aims his rifle, but Cobb 
               doesn't move.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.

               Mal cocks the hammer.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Don't shoot the sheriff. It's against 
                         the law.

               Three deputies appear quietly out of the shadows behind Mal, 
               their guns pointed. The door behind Cobb opens, revealing 
               Garth, his hand bandaged. Mal lowers the rifle.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         So's killing a deputy.

               Tyree comes up behind Mal and takes the rifle from his hand. 
               Suddenly he hits him in the kidney with the rifle butt. Mal 
               goes down.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         We're going to give you a fair 
                         trial...

               Garth has come down the steps and over to Mal. He holds his 
               bandaged hand out in front of him, then kicks Mal viciously.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         ...followed by a first-class hanging.

               Finally Cobb gets up and walks over to look down at Mal.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Or you can ride out of here before 
                         dawn.

               Mal turns his head so he can look up at Cobb.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         All you gotta do is tell me where to 
                         find your friend Emmett.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Rae is serving drinks at a table in the noisy saloon. She 
               sees Slick come in. Their eyes meet, but he goes to the bar 
               and orders a drink. She hurries over there. Slick throws 
               back a shot and turns to her, upset.

                                     SLICK
                         Did your brother tell you he killed 
                         a deputy?

               Rae is taken aback.

                                     SLICK
                         Jake never showed up. Sheriff Cobb 
                         arrested Mal. Took him off to jail.

               Rae begins to crack. Slick takes her into his arms. Stella 
               moves up behind the bar, looking closely at Rae.

                                     STELLA
                         What's going on here, Rae?

               INT. CELLBLOCK - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

               Close on Mal as he dabs at a split lip with the tail of his 
               shirt. He's sitting on a cot in a cell. He has been beaten 
               more. As the door to the outer office clangs open, he reacts 
               with resignation; here comes more pain. But when he looks 
               up, it is Paden standing outside the bars. Behind Paden, 
               Garth throws a hostile look at Mal and goes out. Paden notes 
               Mal's condition. Mal regards Paden coolly.

                                     PADEN
                         Why are they doing this, Mal?

                                     MAL
                         Because they enjoy it.

                                     PADEN
                         I heard from Stella you were trying 
                         to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?

                                     MAL
                         You don't know?

               Paden takes the rebuke and shakes his head "no".

                                     MAL
                         Cobb's men just about killed him. 
                         That's what happened.

               Paden reacts.

                                     MAL
                         I got there just short of too late.

                                     PADEN
                              (pained)
                         Lucky.

               Mal snorts derisively at that and glances around.

                                     MAL
                         Yeah, it's working out real good.

                                     PADEN
                         Where's Emmett now?

               Mal gives him a disbelieving look.

                                     MAL
                         You're working for Cobb these days, 
                         aren't you?

               Paden grimly acknowledges that.

                                     MAL
                         Your friends have been beating me to 
                         find that out. You think I'm gonna 
                         just tell you?

               Mal gets up to face Paden, separated by only a few inches 
               and the steel bars.

                                     MAL
                         You waltzed in here pretty easy, and 
                         you can go out the same way.
                              (motions him away)
                         Me they're figuring to carry out.

               Paden knows that no explanation will suffice here. Sadly, he 
               turns away from his former riding companion and leaves.

               OMIT

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Rae waits nervously behind the noisy saloon, peering into 
               the darkness. Now she sees what she's been waiting for: Paden 
               comes out of the shadows. His mind elsewhere, it takes him a 
               moment to focus on Rae.

                                     RAE
                         Is he all right?

                                     PADEN
                              (considers a moment)
                         It looks bad, Rae. He's a hard man, 
                         and he won't give them what they 
                         want. It's gonna cost him.

                                     RAE
                         Can't you stop them?

                                     PADEN
                         I don't think so.

               Rae begins to cry quietly and leans against a wall. Phoebe 
               appears from the other direction and goes up to Rae.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Rae? It's Phoebe.

               EXT. REAR OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               Jake has put his horse in the little corral behind the Hollis 
               house. He whistles as he goes up onto the back porch and in 
               the door.

               INT. KITCHEN/SITTING ROOM (HOLLIS HOUSE) - NIGHT

               There is one, dim lamp burning in the room. Jake sails his 
               hat across the room onto a hook, picks up a match, and lights 
               a second lamp. He calls out softly.

                                     JAKE
                         Kate?

               He picks up the lamp and moves toward the dark office at the 
               front of the house and the stairs which lead upstairs. He 
               steps through the door and freezes. A cocked six-gun appears 
               near his ear.

               INT. LAND OFFICE (HOLLIS HOUSE) - NIGHT

               In the light of Jake's lamp he sees: four masked men have 
               Kate, J.T., and Augie gagged and held at gunpoint. The little 
               boy is in his nightshirt. For one long moment Jake seems to 
               be considering a play. McKendrick is the one with the gun to 
               Jake's head.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Don't.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Rae has been tearfully telling Phoebe her story as Paden 
               stands nearby.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Looking for Jake? Jake's been with 
                         me all evening. I just left him.

                                     PADEN
                              (suddenly alert)
                         Where is he now?

                                     PHOEBE
                         He went home.

               Paden takes off running into the darkness. Phoebe looks after 
               him, confused. Rae grabs her by the shoulders.

                                     RAE
                         All evening? Even after Slick came?

                                     PHOEBE
                         Slick?

               Rae begins to understand an awful truth.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               A masked man (Hoyt) steadies Jake, hands bound behind his 
               back, on one of the horses Red and the Watching Cowboy have 
               brought up to the front of the house. Another of the men 
               (Scruffy) is just coming out onto the porch.

               INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

               Inside only two masked men remain, McKendrick and Swann. 
               J.T. watches them with hostile eyes. Swann notices Kate 
               peering out the window at Jake.

                                     SWANN
                         Take a long look, lady. It's the 
                         last you'll see of him.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Shut up.

               McKendrick has been looking thoughtfully at the ledgers and 
               records shelved around the land office. Now he picks up the 
               lamp Jake brought into the room. It lights his eyes above 
               the bandana mask. They lock with J.T.'s . McKendrick heaves 
               the lamp into the shelves. Kerosene flames engulf the ledgers. 
               McKendrick starts to move toward the door.

               J.T. snaps. He picks up a heavy register book and hurtles it 
               with enormous force, hitting McKendrick in the back of the 
               head and knocking him down. J.T. dives for McKendrick's gun.

               Kate watches in terror, then sees Swann point his gun at the 
               scrambling J.T. She grabs Swann's arm, and his gun fires 
               into the floor.

               J.T. comes up with McKendrick's gun and fires quickly at 
               Swann, who has thrown off Kate. Swann, hit in the shoulder, 
               crashes back through a window and out onto the porch.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Jake reacts in anguish and twists in his saddle. Hoyt points 
               a cocked gun at him.

               INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

               Scruffy, back at the door now, fires twice into J.T., slamming 
               his big body backward against the base of a counter.

               Kate's scream is muffled by her gag. Augie, eyes wide, darts 
               to his father's body, but rather than embrace him, he pries 
               the gun from J.T.'s fingers and raises it toward Scruffy. 
               Kate sees what's happening and leaps at Scruffy. He viciously 
               pistol-whips her. Her unconscious, falling body knocks the 
               gun from Augie's hand.

               McKendrick is straightening now, his head clearing. His 
               bandana has fallen from his face. He looks in horror at the 
               wounded Hollises. Augie stares at his revealed face.

               Scruffy's gun is cocked and pointed at Augie.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Stop it!

                                     SCRUFFY
                         He saw you.

               McKendrick hates the way it's gone.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         Bring him with us.

               EXT. END OF STREET - NIGHT

               Paden runs up. Down the street in front of the Hollis house 
               a mass of men and horses, lit by the growing flames, thunders 
               away into the night. Paden races toward the house, as 
               neighbors rush about raising the alarm.

               EXT. HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               Paden runs up to the open front door and is momentarily 
               stopped by the heat.

               INT. LAND OFFICE - NIGHT

               In among the flames a bleeding Kate is desperately trying to 
               drag J.T.'s inert bulk to the door. Paden reaches her, picks 
               her up, and runs out. Two neighbors pass him on their way to 
               J.T.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               A chaotic scene as the fire-fighting is organized. Several

               Neighbor Women help Paden ease Kate down on a blanket.

                                     KATE
                         Help J.T.!

                                     NEIGHBOR WOMAN
                         Where's Augie?
                              (to Paden)
                         Her boy must be upstairs!

               Paden rises as if to go back in, but stops at --

                                     KATE
                         No, no... they took him. They took 
                         my Augie.

               Paden reacts to this, then turns as the two neighbors lay 
               J.T.'s body nearby.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Word of the fire has not reached here, and normal, noisy 
               activity reigns. Slick is dealing a three-man poker game.

               Rae watches him from across the room, then takes a drink 
               over to him. When she places it before him, he looks up 
               appreciatively, then goes back to his game. She puts her 
               arms around him from behind and kisses his neck, then slides 
               sensuously into the empty seat beside him. He ignores her 
               adoring look and roaming hands, but smiles as he plays.

               BENEATH THE TABLE. Rae's left hand roves excitingly high on 
               Slick's thigh. Now, so smooth and quick we barely see it, 
               her right hand lifts his trouser leg and slips the custom-
               made dagger from his boot.

               Slick deals a hand. Rae watches him thoughtfully. The swinging 
               doors behind them crash open, and a TOWNSMAN bursts in.

                                     TOWNSMAN
                         Fire! The land office is on fire!

               Most of the patrons rush out, including the players in Slick's 
               game, who grab their chips first. Slick peeks at one of the 
               thrown-down hands out of curiosity, then rises slowly.

                                     SLICK
                         Shall we take a look?

               Rae nods, and when she rises to take his arm, her hands are 
               empty.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               The townspeople have formed a bucket brigade in a losing 
               battle with the fire at the Hollis house. SHOUTS fill the 
               air above the ROAR of the inferno.

               Stella is among the new arrivals from the saloon. She is 
               stopped by the sight of Kate, bloody and hysterical, being 
               borne away. Horrified by the scene, Stella now snaps out of 
               it and begins YELLING ORDERS to the saloon patrons to help 
               fight the blaze.

               Paden is only a few feet from the flames, at the head of the 
               bucket line. He is in shirt sleeves, sweaty and sooty. The 
               heat of the fire is driving the line back. The Townsman next 
               to Paden yells to him --

                                     TOWNSMAN
                         There's no way! It's a goner!

               Cobb, Tyree, and Kyle appear from the shadows. Cobb takes in 
               the scene and spots J.T. being carried across the street. He 
               motions Tyree over to investigate, then moves toward the 
               fire.

               Slick and Rae arrive within the light of the blaze. Slick 
               watches with detached interest, but Rae's gaze quickly locks 
               on Cobb moving through the chaos. She sees him now with new 
               eyes.

               Phoebe, crying, watches as J.T.'s limp body is hurried off 
               on a stretcher, DR. SKINNER in attendance. She turns and is 
               face to face with Tyree, who grasps her arms. She regards 
               him with revulsion and fear, then breaks from him and runs 
               off.

               Cobb moves up next to Paden.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Give it up.

               Paden glances at him, then throws more water on. But now the 
               bucket line slows to a halt. The townspeople fade back a 
               little to watch the inevitable.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I hate to see this kind of thing in 
                         my town.

               Paden glares at Cobb, who is watching the fire.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I'm going to have to look into this.

                                     PADEN
                         Yeah, maybe I will too.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                              (looks at him)
                         I thought we talked about that.

                                     PADEN
                         We didn't talk about this.
                              (a beat, indignant)
                         They took the little boy, Cobb.

               Paden moves off toward a nearby hitching post, where he has 
               left his gunbelt and hat. Cobb looks after him a moment, 
               then follows. They are now a short distance from the 
               onlookers. Paden straps on his gunbelt, but his eyes are on 
               Cobb as he approaches, silhouetted against the flames.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You're still worried about the dog, 
                         aren't you?

               Paden ties his holster to his thigh.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything 
                         will be put straight in a few days.

                                     PADEN
                         I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson 
                         straight.

               Something flicks through Cobb's eyes. He turns slowly and 
               looks at the scene behind him. At the edge of the crowd a 
               tired Stella sits on an overturned bucket, watching the fire; 
               she wipes her sweaty brow with the sleeve of her dress. Still 
               looking that way --

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I never could count on you to be 
                         reasonable.
                              (turns back to Paden)
                         Don't force me to make an adjustment 
                         around here.

                                     PADEN
                         Cobb, you've got nothing I need.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I'm not thinking about your future, 
                         Paden. I'm worried about Stella.

                                     PADEN
                         What's she got to do with it?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Not a thing. She's just a mutual 
                         friend.
                              (a beat)
                         But if you wind up on the wrong side 
                         of this, she's going to get hurt.

               Paden stares at Cobb, but now his eyes follow Cobb's right 
               hand, which swings up to Paden's shoulder.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         I'm just trying to save you from 
                         yourself. Don't change your luck.

               Cobb lets his hand drop and begins to move away.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Get some sleep, Paden. Things'll 
                         look better tomorrow.

               Paden watches as Cobb walks over to Stella. Cobb takes a 
               handkerchief from his pocket and squats before Stella. He 
               starts to wipe her forehead solicitously, but she takes the 
               handkerchief from his hand. Cobb looks back at Paden as he 
               rises and moves off.

               Paden turns and looks into the leaping flames. Our eyes can 
               barely discern the change as these flames dissolve into 
               others, the fire now in --

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               The low fire illuminates Emmett, who is sitting on the hay. 
               He is sweating badly and seems to be concentrating on some 
               rigorous task. Now we see what it is -- to stand up. He 
               struggles to his feet, wincing in pain, his hand steadying 
               against the rock. When he is upright, he tries to clear his 
               head and finally lets go of the wall. For a moment he seems 
               all right. Then, suddenly, he drops heavily back to the floor. 
               The fall sends more pain shooting through his ribs. He's 
               going nowhere.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

               Middle of the night. All is quiet, no one on the street. Rae 
               watches from the shadows across the street as DEPUTY FOX 
               leaves the jail and moves away. Rae goes toward the jail.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               The place is nearly deserted. Paden sits alone at a table 
               killing a bottle of the good stuff. Stella watches him pour 
               another drink.

                                     STELLA
                         Can't you drink any faster? We need 
                         the bottles.

               Paden throws her a look as she takes one of the empty chairs.

                                     STELLA
                         What is it that I can't figure?

                                     PADEN
                         What do you mean?

                                     STELLA
                         Cobb's got something on you, and it 
                         must be pretty good.

               Paden is impressed, even at this late date, by her acuity.

                                     PADEN
                         What makes you say that?

                                     STELLA
                         If he didn't you'd never sit still 
                         while this was happening.

                                     PADEN
                         You sure? Maybe that's the kind of 
                         friend I am.

                                     STELLA
                              (laughs derisively)
                         Nah!
                              (moving on)
                         What's he got? This is a nice saloon, 
                         but there are other nice saloons. 
                         It's not the money. Not for you. Why 
                         can't I get ahold of it?
                              (watches him take a 
                              drink)
                         Cobb says there's no telling what 
                         you're going to care about.

                                     PADEN
                              (bitterly amused)
                         Is that what he said? Well, he figured 
                         it okay this time.

               She regards him as he looks at his glass. Then he looks up, 
               and for one moment their eyes meet. Paden, uncomfortable, 
               quickly looks away. In that second, she understands her own 
               role in this. And she is deeply moved. They are silent 
               together.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

               Mal looks up as the door to the outer office clangs open. 
               Deputy Garth comes in with Rae in tow. Mal comes to the front 
               of his cell.

                                     GARTH
                         Look who's here, Johnson, it's your 
                         sweet little sister. You remember 
                         her, works at The Midnight Star. 
                         Everybody knows her.

               Mal and Rae look at each other.

                                     GARTH
                         She wanted to see you. Course I had 
                         to search her. I'm not sure I did a 
                         good job. Might have missed something.
                              (holds up his bandaged 
                              hand)
                         Only got one good hand, you know.

               Rae steps toward Mal, but Garth suddenly grabs her arm and 
               flings her back against the wall opposite Mal's cell. He 
               moves close to Rae and slips the big ring of keys over his 
               bandaged right hand, freeing his left. He looks once at Mal, 
               then down Rae's body. His left hand fondles her.

                                     GARTH
                         Maybe I better check her a little 
                         closer.

               Mal's eyes flame as Garth takes Rae in a lascivious embrace. 
               Suddenly Rae dips to one side within his arms. Her hand comes 
               up from her boot with Slick's dagger and plunges it into 
               Garth's back. The deputy jolts back a few steps in shock, 
               already pulling a six-gun from his belt with his left hand. 
               He fires once into Rae's body. She goes down.

               Garth is cocking the gun again with weakening fingers when 
               Mal's hand encircles his neck and pulls him violently back 
               against the bars. Garth's gun clatters away down the hall.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

               Deputy Fox has heard the shot and is running toward the jail.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

               Garth, his neck broken, lies crumpled outside Mal's cell. 
               Rae is unconscious and bloodied against the far wall. The 
               large key ring is on the floor under Garth's leg and out of 
               Mal's reach. Mal's anguished gaze darts from Rae to the keys 
               as he begins to drag the dead weight of Garth's leg toward 
               the bars. The key ring is dragged a few inches, then slips 
               free. Mal tries again, then hears the front door SLAM open 
               in the outer office. Mal looks at the gun lying useless down 
               the hall.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO JAIL - NIGHT

               Fox draws his gun as he rushes across toward the cellblock 
               door.

                                     FOX
                         Garth! You in there, Garth?

               INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

               The keys still lie in the middle of the hall, the gun down 
               at the end.

               Fox comes through the door, gun raised, and takes in the 
               sight of the two bodies. He looks up in surprise as Slick's 
               dagger flies into his chest with a THUNK. Fox dies.

               Down the line of bars, Mal's right arm is extended into the 
               corridor, as it was when he released the knife.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Paden is leaning all the way over the bar to extract a glass 
               from beneath it. He straightens and walks back to the table, 
               where Stella still sits. Now, however, she has drawn her 
               legs up before her on the chair and is hugging her knees, 
               deep in thought. The saloon is now empty save for these two.

               Paden pours them each a drink and hands Stella's to her. 
               This brings her back. He clinks his glass with hers and toasts --

                                     PADEN
                         To my midnight star.

               They exchange a long look, then drink.

                                     STELLA
                         Cobb's using me to stop you. So good 
                         people are being hurt because of me.
                              (a beat)
                         That makes me mad.

               Listening closely, he finds this last bit endearing.

                                     STELLA
                         Some people think because they're 
                         stronger -- or meaner -- they can 
                         push you around. I've seen a lot of 
                         that. But it's only true if you let 
                         it be. The world is what you make of 
                         it.

                                     PADEN
                         I like your attitude. But it can be 
                         risky.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm ready for that.

               There is a challenge in her eyes as she reaches out and slides 
               the whiskey bottle away from him.

                                     STELLA
                         How about you?

                                     PADEN
                         I don't want you to get hurt.

                                     STELLA
                         He can't hurt me if he's dead.

               Paden looks at her with growing appreciation. A light is 
               coming back into his face. A smile slowly grows on his lips, 
               mirroring hers.

               The door behind the bar bangs open, and Phoebe comes out, 
               breathless.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Stella, come quick!

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

               Phoebe leads them into the dimly-lit room and goes to her 
               knees beside Rae, who lies wounded on the floor. Rae is semi-
               conscious and moaning. Stella stoops to examine her wound.

                                     PHOEBE
                              (crying)
                         She sprung her brother... all by 
                         herself! And this is what happened... 
                         He brought her here.

                                     PADEN
                         Where'd he go?

                                     PHOEBE
                         I told him about Jake and the little 
                         boy. He went off after Emmett.

                                     STELLA
                              (to Phoebe)
                         Stop your crying. Go get Doc Skinner 
                         and bring him to the shed.
                              (to Paden)
                         Pick her up.

               Phoebe hurries out. Paden kneels next to Stella.

                                     STELLA
                         I've got a place I can hide her.

                                     PADEN
                         You better get in there with her 
                         until this thing is over.

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               Emmett works by the light of the fire, checking one of the 
               guns taken from the deputies. He hears something we do not, 
               but continues to work for a few moments more. Now we hear 
               it: an approaching rider. Emmett stands up gingerly and moves 
               painfully back into the shadows. He is much improved but 
               still tentative.

               Mal comes into the cave carrying his Henry rifle. Emmett 
               reappears, lowering his gun.

                                     EMMETT
                         I didn't think you were going to 
                         make it back.

               Mal steps into the light, revealing his bruised face.

                                     MAL
                         I almost didn't.

                                     EMMETT
                              (reacts to Mal's 
                              condition)
                         Where's Jake?

                                     MAL
                         McKendrick's men got him.

                                     EMMETT
                         Is he alive?

               Mal indicates that he doesn't know. Emmett accepts that and 
               picks up his gunbelt.

                                     MAL
                         It's worse than that, Emmett.

               Emmett looks up, waiting.

                                     MAL
                         They took him at your sister's house. 
                         Her husband was shot. I don't know 
                         if he's going to make it.

               Emmett feels real pain.

                                     EMMETT
                         Kate?

                                     MAL
                         She was hurt... pretty bad.
                              (hates to tell him)
                         Emmett, they took the little boy 
                         with them.

               Emmett lets this all sink in. And then his face and body 
               begin to transform. All the pain is swept away in a surging 
               current of vengeful energy. The MUSIC begins to build, as 
               Emmett moves with eerie deliberateness to arm himself. He 
               picks up one of the extra gunbelts and loops it over his 
               shoulder.

               Mal slides into his bandolier. Emmett indicates the gunbelts 
               remaining on the floor.

                                     EMMETT
                         Want one of these?

               Mal turns. He now holds his father's Henry rifle in addition 
               to his own, one awesome weapon in each hand.

                                     MAL
                         This oughta do.

               OMIT

               EXT. HOTEL - SILVERADO - DAWN

               Cobb, having just finished breakfast, steps out into the 
               morning light and looks around at his domain. He works the 
               toothpick in his mouth and watches Tyree come slowly up the 
               street on horseback. They nod their greetings and head down 
               the street.

               EXT. JAIL - DAWN

               Tyree ties his horse in front, and the two men go inside.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Cobb is barely in the door when he stops, noticing something 
               out of place. The gun cabinet has been forced open; its 
               splintered door is ajar.

                                     TYREE
                         Garth!
                              (nothing)
                         Yo, Fox!

               Tyree draws his gun, but Cobb is already moving toward the 
               cellblock door.

               INT. CELLBLOCK - DAWN

               Cobb and Tyree survey the scene: the empty cell, three pools 
               of blood, two bodies -- Garth and Fox. Cobb watches as Tyree 
               checks the two deputies and shakes his head.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Get Kyle and Dusty over here. And 
                         keep your eyes open. I'm running out 
                         of deputies.

               He goes out.

               INT. SALOON STAIRS - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

               The Bartender comes to the head of the stairs wearing a 
               nightshirt.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Stella ain't here, Sheriff. I checked 
                         her room.

               Now we see Cobb waiting at the bottom of the steps, 
               thoughtful.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         And you don't know where Paden is?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Haven't seen him since last night.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Let me know if you do. And tell Stella 
                         I want to see her.

               Cobb turns and walks to the open, outer doors at the corner 
               of the saloon. The swinging doors are still hooked back for 
               the night. When Cobb stops in the doorway, he casts a long 
               shadow across the room. He stares out into the town for 
               several beats, then lifts his gun from its holster and checks 
               the action.

               EXT. BORDER OF MCKENDRICK RANCH - MORNING

               The McKendrick brand is fashioned in wood at the peak of an 
               arch over the road. Beyond it, in the distance, cattle are 
               grazing on the rolling land.

               EXT. MCKENDRICK GRAZING LAND - MORNING

               Hundreds of cattle are grazing here in the morning light, a 
               sea of speckled hides. Now a Cowboy pulls up in the 
               foreground. He is heavily armed. His watchful gaze is not on 
               the cattle, but outward toward the horizon.

               EXT. BUNKHOUSE/CENTRAL AREA - MCKENDRICK RANCH - MORNING

               More Cowboys here, armed and watchful. Red comes along a 
               corral and climbs up onto a fence to peer into the distance.

               EXT. CASA GRANDE - VERANDA - MORNING

               Scruffy, scratching his belly, walks along the porch of the 
               main ranch house, the casa grande. As he comes up to us at 
               the corner and looks around, we see that he is wearing Jake's 
               elaborately tooled, double gunbelt with the pearl-handled 
               Colts.

               As he moves down the other side of the house, we see 
               McKendrick standing at a window, looking out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               We're behind McKendrick now. On the wall next to the window 
               there is a large, framed photograph of Murdo McKendrick, a 
               big, ferocious man, sitting rather stiffly in a chair. On 
               one side of him stands his wife, as thin and tough as a nail. 
               On the other, beneath a large, paternal hand, a small boy -- 
               young Ethan.

               McKendrick turns away from the window and for an instant his 
               eye is stopped by the photograph. McKendrick looks unsettled. 
               He hasn't slept.

               INT. BEDROOM (SECOND FLOOR) - MORNING

               Augie is huddled on a bed in the corner of the dark room, 
               frightened, still wearing the nightshirt he had on when 
               abducted. Suddenly, sunlight blinds him.

               The Watching Cowboy from the night before has thrown open 
               the curtains. He looks out over the roof of the veranda, 
               then turns back. He gives Augie an odd look and moves toward 
               the door, first kicking a Guard Cowboy awake in his chair.

               EXT. ROLLING RANGE - MORNING

               Emmett and Mal ride side by side. Relentless. You wouldn't 
               want to be the people they're going to visit.

               Now a solitary rider appears on the ridge above them, moving 
               the same way. Mal notices him first, then Emmett. It is Paden, 
               and now he is sloping down to join them.

               He moves in alongside them. They exchange looks. Then all 
               three look ahead. Where they are going.

               INT. STORAGE SHED - SILVERADO - DAY

               Dr. Skinner has tended Rae on a cot in the dark recess of 
               the shed and now moves with Stella to the door. Phoebe kneels 
               beside Rae.

                                     DR. SKINNER
                         If her skin gets cold, you better 
                         come for me.

               Stella nods, then cracks the door to peek outside.

               EXT./INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

               WHAT SHE SEES. This shed is down the alley from the back of 
               the Midnight Star. The alley is empty.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Dr. Skinner comes out and begins to walk away. Slick appears 
               from between two buildings. They nod to each other, and Dr. 
               Skinner walks away. Slick watches him for a moment, then 
               moves up the alley, looking around as he goes. He walks past 
               the shed and on toward the street.

               EXT. CORNER OF ALLEY AND STREET - DAY

               Slick reaches the end of the alley and stops. Cobb comes 
               down the sidewalk toward him. They talk confidentially. Slick 
               shakes his head. They part, continuing their separate prowls.

               EXT. CENTRAL AREA - MCKENDRICK RANCH - DAY

               IN THE CORRAL. One of the horses drinking at the trough lifts 
               its head, ears twitching. A wave of restlessness goes through 
               the horses. On the top of the fence, Red notices and begins 
               to listen intently.

               ON THE VERANDA. Scruffy stands up from a step and looks off 
               toward the rise beyond the corrals. Alarm creeps into his 
               face.

               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann, his shoulder bandaged, comes out to 
               join a Sentry Cowboy looking with concern at the rise. 
               Suddenly, the Sentry Cowboy starts running toward a saddled 
               horse nearby. Red has jumped from the fence now too and 
               mounted up quickly. The two horsemen head off toward the 
               rise at a gallop.

               Swann looks in alarm at --

               THE CREST OF THE RISE. Pouring into view with a ground-shaking 
               RUMBLE is a huge herd of stampeding cattle.

               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Swann turns to the door of the bunkhouse 
               and shouts inside.

                                     SWANN
                         Stampede!

               ON THE RISE. Red and the Sentry Cowboy tear toward the 
               oncoming cattle. They fire their guns repeatedly in the air, 
               trying to turn the herd.

               AT THE CORRAL. Scruffy runs across from the casa grande and 
               joins other Cowboys trying to saddle and mount panicked 
               horses. Scruffy's horse rears and breaks away from him.

               ON THE RISE. Red and the Sentry Cowboy are closing with the 
               dust-enshrouded herd, still firing their guns. Suddenly, 
               from the cloud, there are answering shots. The Sentry Cowboy 
               is shot dead off his horse.

               Emerging like a spirit from the dust at the edge of the herd, 
               comes Emmett, six-gun in hand.

               On the other side of the herd, Paden's form materializes. He 
               aims his Winchester and fires. Red's horse rears. Red goes 
               down and the herd pounds over him.

               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt comes out the door, buckling on his 
               gunbelt. He looks at the on-rushing stampede, then toward 
               the corral where several Cowboys are swinging up on their 
               horses. Suddenly, there is gunfire from the roof of the 
               bunkhouse above Hoyt. One of the Cowboys in the corral goes 
               down. Another draws his gun and lifts it toward the bunkhouse, 
               but is shot before he can fire. The other Cowboys head for 
               cover. Hoyt stops some men who are coming out the door behind 
               him, and edges out to try to locate the source of the fire.

               ON THE VERANDA. McKendrick comes out of the casa grande and 
               runs to the corner of the veranda nearest the rise. He takes 
               in the stampede, which is almost upon them now, then hears 
               gunfire to his right. He looks back there and sees Mal on 
               the bunkhouse roof, above Hoyt and firing from the protection 
               of the raised rim. Now Mal swings his rifle around toward 
               McKendrick. McKendrick jumps around the corner of the house 
               as the wall where he was standing takes a hit.

               SERIES OF SHOTS. The stampede hits the ranch. The herd splits, 
               the mass of cattle heading between the casa grande and the 
               bunkhouse/corral area; the rest go around behind the casa 
               grande. They take down everything in their way. Fences fall, 
               holding pens are destroyed, horses run free, and Cowboys 
               scramble away from the deadly current of rampaging cattle.

               NEAR THE BARN. Paden pulls up on the edge of the flow and 
               fires repeatedly at the Cowboys scrambling for safety. Swann 
               is among those hit.

               BEHIND THE CASA GRANDE. Emmett pulls his horse out of the 
               flow, protected by the building, then dismounts, ties the 
               horse, and runs up to the back door of the house. He throws 
               away the empty, extra six-gun in his hand as he looks 
               carefully inside. He draws his own gun and goes in.

               NEAR THE BARN. Paden is coming under increasing fire from 
               the bunkhouse as the cattle thin. He rides into the barn at 
               the end of the corral.

               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt directs some of his men, including 
               Scruffy, to work their way along under the eaves of the 
               bunkhouse and go after Paden. Hoyt glances upward toward the 
               sound of Mal's rifle.

               INT. CASA GRANDE - DAY

               Emmett works his way carefully down the central hall, gun 
               ready. He looks up the main staircase, sees nothing, and 
               edges forward. At the top of the stairs behind him, the 
               Watching Cowboy jumps into view. Emmett spins and ducks as 
               the Watching Cowboy fires. The finial splinters. Emmett's 
               shot follows immediately. The Watching Cowboy is hit and 
               tumbles the full length of the stairs, dead.

               EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

               ON THE VERANDA. McKendrick reacts to the shots behind him in 
               his house. He moves toward a window and opens it.

               ON THE BUNKHOUSE ROOF. Mal switches to his father's Henry 
               and shifts around to fire at some outriding Cowboys who are 
               thundering in from the range.

               AT THE BARN. Three cowboys dive through the main door in 
               pursuit of Paden. Scruffy, one of Jake's pearl-handled Colts 
               at the ready, sneaks along the side of the barn.

               INT. CASA GRANDE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

               Emmett moves away from the stairwell and cautiously rounds a 
               corner, focused on an open bedroom door up ahead. Suddenly, 
               the Guard Cowboy steps boldly into view in that doorway, gun 
               raised, using Augie as a shield. Emmett cannot fire. He dives 
               back around the corner as the Guard Cowboy gets off a shot. 
               Seeing his miss, the Guard Cowboy slams closed the bedroom 
               door and locks it.

               Instantly Emmett is running that way. He flies into the 
               bedroom next door.

               INT. HOSTAGE BEDROOM - DAY

               The Guard Cowboy has backed against the wall, gun raised 
               toward the door. Augie is still clutched to his chest.

               The window overlooking the roof of the veranda implodes and 
               Emmett arrives in a shower of glass. The stunned Guard Cowboy 
               spins, opening an angle between himself and Augie. Emmett 
               doesn't need much. He fires before he stops rolling. The 
               Guard Cowboy falls back against the wall.

               INT. CASA GRANDE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY

               McKendrick, gun poised, stands over the body of the Watching 
               Cowboy, reacting to the shots above. He is about to go up 
               there when the front door crashes open as a Cowboy, shot by 
               Mal, staggers into the hall. He leans against the hall table 
               and fires out the door. Two more shots from Mal finish the 
               Cowboy and a large vase.

               McKendrick changes him mind about going upstairs. He moves 
               quickly toward the door at the back of the house.

               INT. HOSTAGE BEDROOM - DAY

               Augie is trembling in Emmett's arms. Emmett soothes him, 
               then looks into his tear-stained face.

                                     EMMETT
                         Augie, where's Jake?

                                     AUGIE
                              (chokes it out)
                         He's dead.

               Emmett reacts to this hard news.

                                     AUGIE
                         They hung him!

               Slowly a peculiar twinkle grows in Emmett's eyes.

                                     EMMETT
                         They hung him?

               EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

               AT THE BUNKHOUSE. Hoyt is hugging the side wall of the 
               bunkhouse. He warily looks around the back corner.

               WHAT HE SEES. Mal's horse is tethered near a stack of crates 
               and barrels that rises almost to the roof.

               INT. BARN - DAY

               Paden is in an empty stall part-way down one side of the 
               barn. The three Cowboys have him pinned down from the front. 
               Paden's horse does a panicky dance in the central aisle. The 
               horses in the other stalls are spooked.

               Scruffy sneaks in the back door of the barn. He peeks around 
               the wall of a stall at Paden's unprotected back. When he 
               sees Paden stop to reload his Colt, Scruffy steps out and 
               aims at him.

               Quite unexpectedly, someone swings down from the loft above, 
               kicking Scruffy and sending him flying into the recess of a 
               stall. Now the figure drops into view. It's Jake! He dives 
               after Scruffy.

               Paden, reloaded now and unaware of the struggle behind him, 
               has to shrink back from a splintering rail. Now he hears two 
               muffled shots from the back of the barn. He looks over there. 
               After a beat, Jake steps into Paden's view, grinning like a 
               maniac and happily buckling his reacquired gunbelt. Paden 
               does a double take. Jake gives him a big "Here I am!" gesture, 
               then indicates he's going up to the loft again to help out 
               with the guys up front. But first, with real relish, he checks 
               his pearl-handled Colts: he draws both at once, tips them up 
               to look into the cylinders, then spins them back into their 
               holsters. Then, with a leap, to the loft.

               EXT. RANGE NEAR CASA GRANDE - DAY

               McKendrick rides flat out toward town.

               INT. BARN - DAY

               There are Cowboys in the first stalls on each side of the 
               barn, and a third in a stall closer to Paden. Jake drops 
               down from the loft behind the first two, his guns in his 
               holsters. They both see him and react. Jake draws both guns 
               and shoots one, spins, and shoots the other.

               The third Cowboy turns to look. His mistake. Paden flies 
               into view and shoots him dead.

               Paden approaches Jake with wonder. Jake shows him an ugly 
               bruise where the rope was around his neck. When he speaks, 
               it is in a hoarse whisper --

                                     JAKE
                         New record.

                                     PADEN
                              (slaps him on the 
                              back)
                         Let's get out of here.

               Paden catches his horse and swings up. Jake pulls a horse 
               from a stall. It is the much-contested pinto, bare-backed 
               but bridled. Paden rides out the back of the barn.

               EXT. CENTRAL AREA - DAY

               BACK OF THE BARN. Paden rides out, but pulls up when he 
               notices that Jake is not following. He is about to go back 
               when something catches his eye.

               WHAT HE SEES. Hoyt is just climbing onto the roof of the 
               bunkhouse, catty-corner from Mal's position.

               Paden squeezes off a shot, but Hoyt has already disappeared 
               from view. Paden looks along the bunkhouse, where he can see 
               Mal firing. Mal is protected at present from Hoyt by the big 
               chimney he is braced against. But if he isn't warned, Hoyt 
               will surprise him. A Cowboy in the bunkhouse spots Paden and 
               fires at him. Paden must warn Mal quickly. Yelling is hopeless 
               in the din. Paden aims carefully at Mal and fires.

               AT MAL. The chimney is hit just above Mal's head. He swings 
               his rifle around toward -- Paden! Paden signals wildly about 
               Hoyt. Mal understands just in time: he flops around the 
               chimney just as Hoyt gets a bead on him. Without knowing it, 
               Mal avenges his father's murder. Hoyt is blown off the roof.

               The bulk of the herd has passed, but confused cattle are 
               everywhere.

               AT THE VERANDA. Jake has ridden across the open area under 
               heavy fire and now rides for protection up and onto the side 
               veranda of the house, firing into all the windows. His 
               momentum carries him all the way out the other end. When he 
               is beyond the porch, he hears a yell, two voices --

                                     EMMETT AND AUGIE
                         Jake!?!

               Jake looks up with a grin. Emmett has Augie out on the roof 
               of the veranda. They are pleased in the extreme at the sight 
               of Jake. Jake brings his horse beneath them and gestures to 
               Augie.

               Augie swallows hard once, strides twice, and leaps out, down, 
               and onto the bare back of the pinto behind Jake.

               Paden comes riding up with Emmett's horse in tow. Emmett 
               moves to the edge of the veranda roof and drops into his 
               saddle. He winces, his ribs throbbing. They turn their horses 
               away from the ranch and head out.

               EXT. RANGE NEAR CASA GRANDE - DAY

               The three horses with four riders come tearing toward us. 
               They form a dusty "V" as they intersect with Mal's arrival 
               from the other side of the bunkhouse. Even now, shots are 
               fired after them. But they are on their way.

               EXT. SHOP ACROSS FROM SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SILVERADO - DAY

               The SHOPKEEPER is placing items in his front window when his 
               eye is caught by something across the street. We can see 
               only a dim reflection of it in the glass. With a concerned 
               look, the Shopkeeper comes outside.

               WHAT HE SEES. Trouble. Five men, loaded for bear, are coming 
               out of Cobb's office: Cobb, McKendrick, Tyree, Kyle, and 
               DUSTY, another deputy.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Dusty mounts up and rides toward the center of town. Kyle 
               goes off in another direction on foot. McKendrick unhitches 
               his horse and speaks to Cobb with some bitterness.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         It never should've got this far, 
                         Cobb.

               Cobb eyes him coolly.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         This is as far as it's going.

               McKendrick swings up and jacks a cartridge into the chamber 
               of his Winchester. He's not as confident as Cobb.

                                     MCKENDRICK
                         I'll do my part. But you better watch 
                         your ass. These guys'll shoot it 
                         off.

               He heads off in the same direction as Dusty. Tyree moves up 
               next to Cobb.

                                     TYREE
                         I'm gonna enjoy this.

               Cobb gives him a sideways glance, then looks around wistfully.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         This used to be a peaceful town.

               Tyree moves off in yet a new direction. The Shopkeeper 
               approaches Cobb nervously.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         What's going on, Sheriff?

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Hide and watch.

               The Shopkeeper reacts big and scurries away to spread the 
               word.

               EXT. STREET CORNER/HOTEL - DAY

               Dusty pulls up at the hotel on the corner and throws his 
               reins over the post. Then, with rifle in hand, he stands on 
               his saddle and climbs to the roof of the porch. He looks 
               down the street, cocks his rifle, and settles into hiding 
               behind the hotel sign.

               McKendrick rides by slowly, exchanging looks with Dusty, and 
               moves down the street.

               Several townspeople have seen Dusty. The panicky, street-
               clearing word spreads.

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

               Rae writhes in pain on the cot. Stella's hand is on Rae's 
               forehead as she speaks to Phoebe.

                                     STELLA
                         Better bring the doc.
                              (as Phoebe turns)
                         Be careful.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The Milliner is urgently closing the shutters on his shop as 
               passersby hurry for home. Phoebe edges out of the alley 
               nearby, turns, and finds herself face to face with Tyree. He 
               regards her malevolently.

                                     TYREE
                         Where you going?

                                     PHOEBE
                              (scared)
                         Nowhere.

                                     TYREE
                         This is no time to be on the streets. 
                         Maybe you oughta come along with me.

               He grasps her arm hard and pulls her along the sidewalk.

               EXT. BOOT HILL - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY

               The four horsemen and the boy pull up near the cemetery and 
               look down at Silverado. Jake lowers Augie to the ground. 
               Emmett hands him a blanket and speaks down to him.

                                     EMMETT
                         Stay here till we get back. Don't 
                         come in.

               The four riders look from the town to each other and check 
               their weapons.

                                     EMMETT
                              (to them all)
                         I'll see you around.

                                     PADEN
                              (smiles)
                         Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

                                     JAKE
                         You're on! Let's get 'em!

               Jake kicks the bare-back into motion and tears off directly 
               toward town. Emmett heads off to the left. Paden begins to 
               move after Jake, but slower. Mal stops him with --

                                     MAL
                         Hey, Paden...

               They look at each other.

                                     MAL
                         Good luck.

               Paden nods it back to him, and the bond is re-formed. Mal 
               heads off at a gallop to the right. They are all going to 
               enter town from different directions.

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

               Rae MOANS loudly, and Stella instinctively reaches out to 
               quiet her, worried about discovery. Stella throws a frustrated 
               glance toward the door -- where is Phoebe?

               She can't wait. She goes to the door and peeks out.

               INT./EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

               Slick checks Rae's room and closes the door. He too is 
               frustrated. Now he looks out the hall window, down at the 
               alley.

               WHAT HE SEES. Stella steps quickly out of the storage shed 
               and moves away.

               Slick runs for the steps.

               EXT. ALLEY NEAR STORAGE SHED - DAY

               Slick runs past the shed door and peers between buildings in 
               search of Stella. She's gone. He comes back to the shed. 
               Before opening the door he does an odd thing: he chops his 
               left forearm sharply downward and a shiny derringer slides 
               crisply into his grip from beneath his sleeve. He enters 
               cautiously.

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

               Slick moves through the dim light. He hears a MOAN and steps 
               forward. He looks down at Rae. Half-delirious, she focuses 
               on him and reacts in terror. He makes the derringer disappear 
               and kneels beside her.

                                     SLICK
                         Don't be afraid, baby. I'll stay 
                         with you until your little friend 
                         comes back.

               EXT. STREET NEAR MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

               Jake comes riding down the street, waving his hat, WHOOPING 
               and HOLLERING. The few remaining pedestrians run for cover 
               at the sight.

                                     JAKE
                              (yelling)
                         Come on out, boys! Jake's in town! 
                         Let's start the ball!

               Jake jumps off the pinto and hitches it in front of the 
               saloon. As he approaches the entrance, set in the cut-off 
               corner of the building, he executes a fast pirouette, scanning 
               down all four blocks that meet here. He finds the doors locked 
               and kicks them open with a loud BANG. He goes inside.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               Tyree has heard the commotion and moves toward it.

               EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Stella is pounding on the door without luck. She gives up, 
               looks around, and hurries off.

               EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

               Tyree stops across the street from the Midnight Star and 
               looks at Jake's horse and the open doors. Across the 
               intersection Kyle appears at a run. Tyree motions him to go 
               around the back of the saloon. Tyree runs across the street. 
               When he is on the porch of the saloon, he pulls his gun and 
               begins edging toward the open doors.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

               It's dark in here with the shutters closed. Tyree jumps 
               inside, gun poised. When Kyle bangs through from the back, 
               Tyree almost shoots him. They scan the room and advance 
               cautiously into the shadows. Nobody here. Now they back out, 
               eyeing the dark stairwell.

               When they are safely on the porch, Tyree motions for Kyle to 
               go down one side of the building while he starts down the 
               other.

               Jake appears from beneath Stella's ramp behind the bar and 
               vaults lightly over the bar. In a moment he stands just inside 
               the open doorway. He peeks out, then turns so his back is to 
               the outside, his guns still holstered.

               EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

               Jake backs quietly out onto the porch. When he stops, he can 
               see both Tyree and Kyle moving along their respective porches.

                                     JAKE
                         Hey!

               Tyree and Kyle spin at the sound. Only then does Jake draw 
               both guns and, pointing them in two completely different 
               directions, he shoots both men at once.

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

               Slick has made himself comfortable next to Rae, who has fallen 
               into a fitful sleep. Now he hears something. The door of the 
               shed opens and closes. He waits confidently for Stella to 
               appear around the intervening wall of barrels and crates.

               But he's looking too low. Mal steps into view, the big Henry 
               rifle in his hand. Slick's eyes widen, but he gets control 
               quickly and rises, trying to gauge Mal's attitude.

               Mal looks from Rae to Slick and back to Rae.

                                     SLICK
                         I'm glad you're here, Mal. I've been 
                         watching her, but she needs a doctor.

                                     MAL
                         Yeah.

               He looks at Slick as he leans his rifle against the wall. 
               Slick looks at the rifle, then at Mal. Mal seems to 
               concentrate on Rae and makes a move that way. When he is 
               past Slick, Slick makes the peculiar, chopping gesture of 
               his left forearm that snaps the derringer into his hand.

               Mal has been waiting for something and is already turning 
               into Slick. Before Slick can raise his gun hand, Mal has 
               Slick's wrist in a vise-like grip. Mal's other arm encircles 
               Slick's torso and crushes him against Mal's body. Two strong 
               men strain against each other.

               The cocked derringer wavers perilously toward the sleeping 
               Rae. Suddenly, Mal twists Slick around, banging his hand 
               into the wall, and the derringer fires. Slick lets it clatter 
               to the floor.

               Rae wakes with a start and watches the combatants in terror.

               The men's eyes are only inches apart. Something flashes 
               through Mal's and he loosens his embrace. Instantly, Slick 
               dips to the right, lifting his boot to his hand. But his 
               dagger is not there.

               Slick's surprised look is answered by Mal's tight grin.

                                     MAL
                         Looking for this?

               Their bodies jerk as Slick gets his last surprise and goes 
               limp in Mal's arms. He falls to the floor, his own boot dagger 
               protruding from his ribcage.

               Mal kneels to embrace his sister.

               EXT. STREETS ON FRINGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

               Emmett rides slowly down the street, his Winchester held 
               ready on his thigh. His eyes continually scan the buildings 
               and alleyways. He slowly rounds a corner.

               Way behind him, off his right shoulder, McKendrick has brought 
               his horse to a stop between two buildings and is carefully 
               aiming at Emmett's back with his Winchester. Now he pulls 
               the hammer back with a CLICK.

               Emmett hears it and twists in the saddle as McKendrick fires. 
               The shot is good, but Emmett's Winchester takes the hit and 
               jumps in his hand. He levels it at McKendrick, cocks the 
               hammer, and squeezes the trigger. Nothing. He tries to work 
               the lever as McKendrick fires again. Emmett's rifle is 
               useless. He throws it away and draws his Colt, firing twice.

               Emmett's bullets hit close to McKendrick. His horse shies. 
               McKendrick turns his horse and rides behind a building.

               SERIES OF SHOTS. Emmett chases after McKendrick along a 
               parallel street. Each man prepares to fire as they reach the 
               intermittent spaces between buildings. McKendrick gets a 
               clear shot and fires twice. Emmett rides around a building 
               and speeds toward McKendrick's path. He comes into the open, 
               ready to fire, but McKendrick is heading off down an alley. 
               Rather than follow, Emmett moves to cut him off.

               EXT. EDGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

               McKendrick has pulled up behind a barn. When Emmett comes 
               into view, McKendrick fires twice, then spurs his horse back 
               into town. Emmett squeezes off one carefully aimed shot, 
               just missing McKendrick before he disappears.

               EXT. BOOT HILL - DAY

               The echoes of gunfire reach the little boy waiting at the 
               cemetery. Augie watches and wonders.

               EXT. HOTEL STREET - DAY

               McKendrick comes out of an alley and tears toward the 
               intersection which Dusty commands from the roof of the hotel 
               porch. McKendrick waves his rifle at Dusty and rounds the 
               corner of the hotel.

               Now Emmett comes out of the alley in pursuit. He slows a bit 
               since McKendrick is no longer in sight. As he moves down the 
               block toward the hotel intersection, he looks into the loading 
               yard of the feed warehouse, which forms a cul-de-sac on his 
               left.

               Now Dusty opens fire from the protection of the hotel sign. 
               Bullets kick up dirt around Emmett, but instead of retreating, 
               he slings himself Indian-fashion down along the protected 
               side of his horse, and rides toward the sign.

               Emmett aims over the mane and fires: once, twice, through 
               the sign. Dusty rises, hit, and Emmett kills him with a third 
               shot. Dusty crashes through the sign to fall to the street.

               Emmett has just straightened in his saddle and snapped open 
               the loading gate of his empty Colt, when McKendrick opens up 
               from where he has reappeared down the street. Emmett is hit 
               in the thigh.

               For one long second there is perfect clarity between the 
               men. Emmett's eyes stare from his pain-contorted countenance 
               at his adversary. McKendrick hesitates only a breath to look 
               at Emmett before raising the rifle and charging.

               Emmett wheels his horse and painfully spurs it back down the 
               block. As McKendrick's fire hits around him, Emmett turns 
               into the nearest cover -- the loading yard of the feed 
               warehouse.

               McKendrick rides toward the mouth of the loading yard with 
               all he's got. He can't let Emmett reload. The glint of victory 
               is in his eyes as he draws near the loading yard.

               He raises his rifle in preparation for the coming clear shot 
               at his trapped enemy. As his horse begins to pass in front 
               of the loading yard, we hear a terrible RUMBLE OF HOOFBEATS 
               on wood. McKendrick's expression changes to horror.

               Emmett has ridden onto the loading dock of the warehouse and 
               charged toward this end. Now he jumps his horse straight out 
               into the air over McKendrick's horse. The hooves of Emmett's 
               horse catch McKendrick full force with a HORRIBLE SOUND.

               Emmett's horse lands on its feet, but just barely. From a 
               cloud of dust Emmett watches McKendrick's horse race on, 
               riderless. Its master is a still shape in the dirt.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Stella has been hurrying through the empty streets. Now she 
               pauses to listen to the new silence.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Cobb listens too. He sits on the steps at the front of his 
               office, toying with an object in his hands. Now he brings it 
               to his mouth. It is his sheriff's badge, and he breathes a 
               fog onto it, then polishes it on his sleeve. He looks at it 
               another moment, smiles to himself, then pins it on his chest.

               EXT. STREETS NEAR SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Paden is walking. He is calm. He rounds a corner and moves 
               out into the center of the new street.

               AT THE END OF THE STREET. Cobb looks up from his seat and 
               sees Paden coming toward him. He had a feeling it would be 
               this way. It makes him sad. He stands up and walks to the 
               center of the street.

               Paden keeps coming. He watches Cobb, resigned. Now Paden 
               stops.

               Stella comes out of an alley. When she takes in the scene, 
               she steps onto the sidewalk and puts her hand on a post. She 
               looks back and forth between the men.

               Cobb sees her, but his only real concern is Paden. Paden 
               sees her, too. His gaze returns to Cobb.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         What a waste. This could have been 
                         such a sweet deal for us.

                                     PADEN
                         Yeah. Bad luck.
                              (a beat)
                         Good-bye, Cobb.

                                     SHERIFF COBB
                         Good-bye, Paden.

               They both draw, and it's impossible to say who moved first. 
               But one is luckier. Paden stands as Cobb falls.

               Paden holsters his gun as though it weighed a hundred pounds.

               CUT TO BLACK.

               SLOW FADE-UP over the SOUNDS of tinkling glasses, piano music, 
               and friendly voices.

               INT. SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

               Four shot glasses sparkle in a line on the bar. A bottle of 
               the good stuff is used to fill them.

               Stella is pouring the drinks from behind the bar. Now the 
               glasses are lifted by Mal, Jake, Paden, and Emmett. Stella 
               holds up the bottle and proposes a toast --

                                     STELLA
                         To California!

               They echo her and clink glasses. Stella clinks with the 
               bottle. When they toss back their drinks, she tips the bottle 
               to her lips, then puts it down on the bar, as the four glasses 
               come down.

                                     EMMETT
                         Gotta go.

                                     MAL
                         Right.

               The four men move toward the door as Stella walks down her 
               ramp. Emmett walks with a slight limp.

               EXT. MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

               Phoebe stands on the porch talking across to Rae, much 
               recovered, who sits on the seat of a wagon heavily loaded 
               with farming supplies. Rae wears a simple dress and looks 
               quite different.

               The men come out onto the porch. Emmett shakes Mal's hand 
               and watches him climb onto the wagon. Mal gets the wagon 
               going, and the other wave.

               Jake has slipped his arm around Phoebe's waist. Now he turns 
               her into his arms for a big kiss.

               Emmett is watching Mal and Rae roll away when a woman's hand 
               touches his back. He turns to find Hannah looking up at him. 
               Paden watches from nearby.

                                     HANNAH
                         Weren't you going to come out to say 
                         good-bye?

                                     EMMETT
                         I already did that.

                                     HANNAH
                         This time you're really going?
                              (he nods)
                         You know where I'll be.

                                     EMMETT
                         That I do.

               They look at each other. She kisses him and steps back. When 
               Emmett looks up from her, Paden is watching him with an amused 
               look. The two men shake hands. Emmett and Jake mount up.

                                     JAKE
                         So long, Paden.

               Paden gives him a nod. Kate and Augie roll up in a buggy. In 
               the back seat, a blanket across his legs, sits J.T. They 
               wait for the brothers. Augie drives for his recovering mother. 
               Stella comes out and stands by Phoebe.

               Hannah is now standing next to Paden. Emmett looks at them 
               as though they were a couple.

                                     EMMETT
                              (to Paden)
                         You might make a farmer yet.

                                     PADEN
                         I've got a job.

               He puts his arm against the post, and his coat is drawn back 
               to reveal the shiny sheriff's badge on his vest.

               Emmett touches the brim of his hat and turns his horse away. 
               He and Jake flank the buggy and head off.

               EXT. OUTSIDE OF TOWN - MORNING

               Emmett and Jake take turns leaning down from their saddles 
               to kiss Kate and Augie and shake hands with J.T.

                                     EMMETT
                              (to Augie)
                         Take care of your folks.

               One final look, and they're off. Jake turns in the saddle 
               only once --

                                     JAKE
                         We'll be back!

               They spur their horses forward, chasing their shadows, heading 
               west.

                                         THE END
