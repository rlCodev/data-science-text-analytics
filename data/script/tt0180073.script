               IN THE BLACKNESS

               The hypnotic voice of a master story-teller:

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         Dear Reader... I've a naughty tale 
                         to tell, plucked from the pages of 
                         history. Tarted up, true, but 
                         guaranteed to stimulate the senses...

               FADE UP ON:

               A STORM-TOSSED SKY

               Rising into the frame, a YOUNG WOMAN's FACE. Her hair whips 
               about in the wind; her face is brittle... beautiful... and 
               as engimatic as St. Theresa. Is she in ecstasy, or in pain?

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         The story of Mademoiselle Renard, a 
                         ravishing young aristocrat, whose 
                         sexual proclivities ran the gamut 
                         from winsome to bestial. Who doesn't 
                         dream of indulging every spasm of 
                         lust, feeding each depraved hunger?

               MALE FINGERS appear at MADEMOISELLE RENARD's collarbone; 
               they start to trace the delicate curve of her neck; her 
               decolletage... MADEMOISELLE seems to writhe, to twist...

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Owing to her noble birth, Mademoiselle 
                         Renard was granted full immunity to 
                         do just that, inflicting pain and 
                         pleasure with equal zest, until one 
                         day --

               Suddenly, ANOTHER FACE enters the frame; a BRUTISH FIGURE 
               WITH A NEANDERTHAL FACE in a roughly sewn leather hood.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Mademoiselle found herself at the 
                         mercy of a man whose skill in the 
                         Art of Pain exceeded her own.

               The WOMAN's eyes flare with fear. There's no question as to 
               her emotion now; she is terrified. The DARK FIGURE forcefully 
               pulls down her dress, revealing the pale skin of her 
               shoulders.

               ANGLE ON: THE WOMAN'S HANDS. The MAN secures them behind her 
               back, and tightens leather bindings around her arms; they 
               cut into her flesh. He gathers her hair gently in his gloved 
               hands, then -- viciously -- he yanks her head back.

               ECU: THE WOMAN'S FACE. She gasps, her eyes thrust upward.

               She's in a courtyard of some kind. And -- in an enormous 
               tower, standing behind a barred window, the SHADOWY FIGURE 
               OF A PRISONER, his hands in irons.

               TITLE CARD: "Picpus Prison outside Paris. 1794."

               TIGHT SHOT: The eyes of the PRISONER, watching the grisly 
               proceedings below.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         How easily, dear Reader, one changes 
                         from predator to prey! And how swiftly 
                         pleasure is taken from some and given 
                         to others!

               ANGLE ON: THE WOMAN as the MASKED MAN -- her executioner -- 
               lowers her head into the grooved block of the guillotine.

               WOMAN's POV: Rows and rows of faces are stare up at her, the 
               jaunty red caps of the JACOBINS interspersed throughout. The 
               CROWD is eerily silent. They seem to be waiting like vultures, 
               ready to descend once blood is shed.

               Near-by, the BODIES OF FRESHLY KILLED ARISTOCRATS are tossed -- 
               like refuse -- into a cart. MEN stand among the dead, foraging 
               for stray riches. An OLD HAG wrestles to pull a gold ring 
               off a wayward, stiff hand.

               CLOSE UP: THE WOMAN'S FACE in shock. A DROP OF BLOOD lands 
               on her cheek from above.

               The CAMERA sweeps UP, UP, UP, past the looming EXECUTIONER, 
               all the way to the GLINTING BLADE OF THE GUILLOTINE, blood 
               from the previous victim dripping from its edge.

               TOP SHOT OF THE WOMAN, HER HEAD POISED FOR DECAPITATION

               The basket waits below; blood seeps through the wicker onto 
               the cobblestones and beneath the FEET of the THRONG.

               THE PRISON TOWER

               The PRISONER turns away from the grisly proceedings below.

               MASTER SHOT: THE GUILLOTINE LOOMS ABOVE THE CROWD

               ANGLE ON: QUILLS, RIPPLING IN THE BREEZE

               Through a tiny window, THE PRISONER sits with his back to 
               us, hunched over his desk in a silk dressing gown. A lush 
               wig trails in ringlets down his back. He writes, furiously.

               ANGLE ON: THE BLADE, TREMBLING, READY TO FALL

               THE EXECUTIONER jiggles the rope, and -- with a terrible, 
               rumbling gravity -- the blade breaks free -- wobbling wildly -- 
               accelerating in speed --

               ANGLE ON: THE PRISONER'S QUILL

               as he dips it into a crimson ink-well. Issuing from the depths 
               of his soul, an odd sound indeed; a little tune with the 
               sing-song cadences of a children's nursery rhyme:

               Claire de la Lune. Outside his window, the BLOODTHIRSTY ROAR 
               OF THE MASSES.

               ANGLE ON: THE GUILLOTINE

               The blade falls -- down, down, down -- aiming right for the 
               woman -- the tender flesh of her exposed neck -- faster -- 
               faster -- until: THE SCREEN SPLASHES BLOOD RED. A SICKENING 
               CRUNCH, followed by a dull THUD.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CHARENTON

               A diagonal patch of red slides open, and we see the EYES OF 
               A YOUNG GIRL, staring straight at us:

                                     MADELEINE
                         Your linens, please.

               CARD: "The Charenton Asylum for the Insane; Years Later."

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUED

               MADELEINE, on tip toe, stares through the peephole of a cell 
               door, her laundry basket on her hip. She's a sweet faced 
               naif with a dirt-smudged face and plenty of spirit.

               A trap in the lower half of the door opens, and through it 
               an unseen hand pushes a bundle of dirty bedsheets.

               MADELEINE gathers them in her basket and moves to the next 
               cell.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Your linens.

               VALCOUR, the asylum's prefect, leads a bald, effeminate 
               lunatic named PITOU from his cell for a morning 
               "constitutional." MADELEINE skirts past them both.

                                     VALCOUR
                              (to MADELEINE)
                         Morning.

                                     MADELEINE
                         G'morning.

               She reaches the last door, and glances anxiously up and down 
               the hallway before sliding open the peephole.

               MADELEINE'S POV: The PRISONER -- over a decade older -- is 
               still hunched over his desk, composing to his heart's content. 
               His silk robe is tattered, and his wig is thin with age.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Pss. 'S me.

               A bundle of sheets tumbles out the trap. MADELEINE kneels.

               There's something bulky hidden in the cloth: a manuscript, 
               written in an ornate hand.

                                     VOICE OF THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                              (mellifluous and low)
                         Careful. The ink's still wet.

               The peephole slides open from inside; a single eye stares 
               out, bloodshot and reptilian.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Now hurry.

               MADELEINE smiles a mischievous smile, then moves on her way.

               INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               She empties the dirty sheets into an enormous pile, then 
               plucks the manuscript from the bottom of the basket, and 
               conceals it under her shawl. Her MOTHER -- an older woman 
               with milky white eyes -- stands over a steaming vat of boiling 
               lye. She stirs a twisted mass of linens with her long, forked 
               laundry pole. Blindness prevents her from seeing MADELEINE, 
               but she hears her nonetheless:

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         That you, Maddy?

               MADELEINE hoists up a basket of clean, wet laundry. She says 
               with feigned innocence:

                                     MADELEINE
                         Yes, Mother. Just taking the bleached 
                         ones out to dry.

               EXT. CHARENTON COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

               Hanging sheets, two chambermaids: MICHETTE and CHARLOTTE, 
               the first as comely as the second is dour. Hastily, MADELEINE 
               drops off her basket of wet linens.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Aren't you going to lend us a hand, 
                         then?

               But MADELEINE's already disappeared.

               EXT. CHARENTON--THE TERRACE AND GROUNDS

               MADELEINE dodges past PATIENTS, basking in the morning light, 
               clutching the hidden manuscript tightly to her breast. PITOU 
               combs imaginary locks with a silver hairbrush; OTHER LUNATICS 
               toss a leather ball in a game of catch.

               As MADELEINE careens around an enormous hedge, she practically 
               runs into THE EXECUTIONER from the opening sequence: BOUCHON. 
               His grim duties during the Terror have since landed him in 
               the madhouse. MADELEINE can feel the manuscript slipping 
               under her shawl and scrambles to catch it before it drops. 
               When she tries to dodge BOUCHON, he blocks her way.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bouchon!

               MADELEINE looks up to see -- sure enough -- the ABBE de 
               COULMIER, the asylum's administrator. He's surprisingly young 
               with lustrous eyes and a handsome face.

               He calls to the LUNATIC, sternly:

                                     COULMIER
                         Remember your manners.

               BOUCHON offers a shy smile, sans most of his teeth. Then -- 
               with great solemnity -- he bows low for MADELEINE to pass.

               She mouths "thank-you" to COULMIER, then scurries on.

               ANGLE ON: THE ABBE DE COULMIER, watching MADELEINE go. HE 
               gazes out at the Elysium spread before him. He can't disguise 
               his satisfaction; Charenton is a good place, a happy place.

               EXT. A PAVILION ON THE EDGE OF THE GROUNDS - MORNING

               Out-of-breath, MADELEINE reaches the front gate. She glances 
               nervously to and fro, then slips the manuscript through the 
               bars to a waiting HORSEMAN.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Here it is; the last chapter.

                                     HORSEMAN
                         Monsieur Masse says he'd like another 
                         manuscript, quick as you please. 
                         He's got himself three presses, and 
                         he can't print 'em fast enough.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll pass the word on, then.

                                     HORSEMAN
                         I'll pay you another visit, with a 
                         share of the profits, once its sold.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll be waiting.

                                     HORSEMAN
                              (grinning flirtatiously)
                         Maybe someday you'll tell me your 
                         name.

               MADELEINE coquettishly arches an eyebrow. The HORSEMAN rears 
               his steed, then charges away in a cloud of dust.

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               CU: A HUGE WOODEN CRATE.

               A BLACK MARKETEER pries the lid off with a crowbar. Inside, 
               stacks of newly-bound volumes embossed with the title Justine.

                                     BLACK MARKETEER
                         This just in; the very latest from 
                         the Marquis de Sade!

               WELL-DRESSED CUSTOMERS snake their way down the grimy street. 
               The MEN hide their faces behind high collars; the WOMEN wear 
               veiled hats. Money changes hands; books fly from the box. 
               Trade is brisk.

               EXT. FOP STREET - CONTINUOUS

               A CROWD has secretly gathered: a MILLINER, a BLACKSMITH, a 
               BUTCHER, and a SOCIETY FOP, to name a few. A STREET URCHIN 
               keeps an eye out for passing police. The FOP reads from the 
               book in a loud whisper:

                                     FOP
                         "Our story concerns a nymph named 
                         Justine, as pretty a maid as ever 
                         entered a nunnery, with a body so 
                         firm and ripe, it seemed a shame to 
                         commit it to God..."

               INT. THE EMPEROR'S PALACE - DAY

               CLOSE UP: THE BOOK as THE FOP'S VOICE bleeds into another, 
               more stentorian ONE:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         "One morning, the Bishop placed his 
                         hand upon her thigh. 'Holy Father!,' 
                         cried she, 'I've come to confess my 
                         sins, not commit them anew!'"

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               A CABINET MINISTER -- MONSIEUR DELBENÈ -- reads aloud.

               NAPOLEON listens, surrounded by his retinue: MINISTERS, 
               GUARDS, a PAINTER, a SCULPTOR and TWO GAUNT TAILORS -- mouths 
               rimmed with pins -- who trim his ermine cape.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         "heedless, the old priest turned her 
                         over on his knee and lifted her skirts 
                         high above her hips, exposing the 
                         pink flesh of her backside. There -- 
                         between the orbs of her dimpled ass -- 
                         lay a blushing rosebud, begging to 
                         be... plucked."

               DELBEN clears his throat.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         "Before Justine could wrestle from 
                         his grasp, this most ungodly man 
                         took a communion wafer -- the body 
                         of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and placed 
                         it on the girl's twitching orifice --
                         "
                              (beat)
                         Must I, Your Majesty?

               The PAINTER, THE SCULPTOR and THE TAILORS are on tenterhooks; 
               NAPOLEON merely arches an eyebrow.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         "As he loosened his manhood from 
                         beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered 
                         a Latin prayer. And then -- with a 
                         mighty thrust -- drove it into her 
                         very entrails --"

                                     NAPOLEON
                              (interrupting at last)
                         Enough!

               THE EMPEROR grabs the book from DELBENÈ.

                                     NAPOLEON
                         Seize every copy; we'll torch them 
                         all on the palace lawn, in full public 
                         view.

               NAPOLEON tosses it into the fireplace. For a blistering 
               moment, we see the book's title: Justine, by Anonymous. It 
               explodes into a ball of flame.

                                     NAPOLEON
                         As for the author... shoot him.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         A word of caution, Sire: we all 
                         remember what happened to Robespierre, 
                         Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to 
                         death, and history might even regard 
                         you as a despot.

                                     NAPOLEON
                         But I am history.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         Of course, Your Highness. 
                         Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de 
                         Sade... succeed, where countless 
                         physicians and priests have failed...

                                     NAPOLEON
                         Yes?

                                     DELBENÈ
                              (sly)
                         No one can fault Napoleon for merely 
                         bringing a man to his senses.

               NAPOLEON gets it; he smiles. This DELBENÈ is clever; very 
               clever indeed. DELBEN smiles back; it's a plan.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         Might I suggest that we order an 
                         appraisal of the Charenton Asylum, 
                         and the rather notorious inmate in 
                         her care. I've the perfect candidate 
                         for the job: Doctor Royer-Collard, 
                         the distinguished alienist. He's a 
                         staunchly moral man of impeccable 
                         character and iron resolve --

               INT. TREATMENT ROOM AT THE HOTEL DIEU

               CLOSE UP: A BLITHERING MADMAN with wild eyes and a drooling 
               lower-lip. With a LURCH, he tips backwards. His head is 
               submerged in a pool of icy blue water. He puckers and gasps 
               for air.

               Reflected in the pool, the face of DR. ROYER-COLLARD, an 
               immaculately groomed gentleman, in his fifties with a square 
               jaw. He looks down at the waterlogged LUNATIC with chilling 
               satisfaction.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         My colleagues have called me old 
                         fashioned; even barbaric.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               The LUNATIC is strapped into a chair with a collapsible back. 
               When ROYER-COLLARD gives the signal -- an imperious nod -- a 
               POCKMARKED ATTENDANT -- the DOCTOR'S footman, GAILLON -- 
               cranks the lever, and the LUNATIC flips backward into a 
               "calming pool." The effect is anything but. As the MADMAN 
               flounders, ROYER-COLLARD explains to DELBEN:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor 
                         an... aggressive... course of 
                         treatment.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         Quite.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I don't seek popularity or renown, 
                         Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher 
                         mission.

               ROYER-COLLARD gives the signal again. GAILLON raises the 
               lever, and the GOON surges upright, his ribcage heaving.

               ROYER-COLLARD strides up to the PATIENT and regards him with 
               sanctimony. The MADMAN quivers under his gaze.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         To take God's tiny blunders... those 
                         He has forsaken... and condition 
                         them with the same force... the same 
                         rigor... you would employ to train a 
                         feral dog or wild stallion.

               Another nod, another crank, and -- with a scream of protest --  
               the LUNATIC is again lowered into the pool.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It may not be pretty, but it is mercy 
                         just the same.

               Splashing and gurgling; DELBENÈ shouts above the tumult:

                                     DELBENÈ
                         It's the Emperor's dearest hope that 
                         you might bring your expertise -- 
                         your proficiency -- to the Charenton 
                         asylum --

               ROYER-COLLARD tastes the idea for a moment.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Charenton? The administrator there 
                         is quite well-loved, is he not?

                                     DELBENÈ
                         I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. 
                         You'll have to be politic.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Do you know how I define "idealism," 
                         Monsieur Delbenè?

               Delben waits for an answer; the DOCTOR's eyes twinkle.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Youth's final luxury.

               ROYER-COLLARD emits a knowing laugh. Delbenè joins him.

               EXT. THE SINISTER GATES OF THE HOTEL DIEU - LATER

               They swing open with a deafening clang, and a DARK CARRIAGE 
               bursts forth. Riding atop it, a pock-marked footman named 
               GAILLON. Its curtains are drawn and it moves at a hell-bent 
               pitch. Strapped to the back, the "calming" chair.

               INT. CHARENTON CHAPEL - DAY

               ONE HAND, GENTLY GUIDING ANOTHER over script written on 
               parchment. COULMIER teaches MADELEINE penmanship; together, 
               they copy a page from St. Augustine's City of God.

               MADELEINE can't help glancing at COULMIER from the corner of 
               her eye: such a virile man dressed in the chaste robes of a 
               monk. An intriguing contradiction.

                                     COULMIER
                         Of course, we mustn't just copy the 
                         words; it's important that we know 
                         what they mean. St. Augustine tells 
                         us that angels and demons walk among 
                         us on the earth; that sometimes, 
                         they jointly inhabit the soul of a 
                         single man...

               MADELEINE can feel his breath on her neck. She turns to him 
               and asks with innocent eyes wide:

                                     MADELEINE
                         Then how can we know who is truly 
                         good, and who is evil?

                                     COULMIER
                         We can't. All we can do is guard 
                         against our own corruption.

               Self-conscious now, COULMIER draws back.

                                     COULMIER
                         You'll practice reading tonight on 
                         your own? For me?

               MADELEINE nods. Indeed she will.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CHARENTON - NIGHT

               Lollygagging in straw, FOUR RIPE ADOLESCENTS: GUERIN, the 
               stable boy, his shirt open in the heat from the near-by 
               laundry vats; MICHETTE, the scullery maid, tumbling out of 
               her corset; LOUISON, the groundkeeper's son, in his 
               nightshirt; CHARLOTTE, primly buttoned to the neck; and 
               MADELEINE. As she "practices reading" from a few stray sheets 
               of parchment, the OTHERS listen enrapt:

                                     MADELEINE
                         "And so the Professor lifted Colombe's 
                         skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me 
                         be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the 
                         ways of love.' With that, he slid 
                         her pantalettes down, down, down 
                         over her knees, and there -- nestled 
                         between her legs -- as pink as a 
                         tulip, as slick as an eel --"

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (interrupting)
                         We oughtn't be reading his nasty 
                         stories --

                                     MADELEINE
                         No one's forcing you to listen.

               The TWO GIRLS lock eyes; CHARLOTTE burns with humiliation.

               Slowly, she sinks back to her place on the ground. Even she 
               can't resist THE MARQUIS' prose.

                                     MADELEINE
                              (with satisfaction)
                         Very well then.

               MADELEINE re-settles, resuming her story:

                                     MADELEINE
                         "...he gazed upon her Venus mound; 
                         her flaxen quim; the winking eye of 
                         God."

               GUERIN nuzzles MICHETTE's neck; CHARLOTTE glances at LOUISON 
               hopefully; he ignores her. She pouts, then interrupts again:

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You've been to his quarters, haven't 
                         you?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Once or twice.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I hear he's got a whetstone and 
                         chisel, and he uses them to sharpen 
                         his teeth.

                                     MADELEINE
                         He's a writer, not a madman.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Then what's he doing here?

                                     LOUISON
                         Murder.

                                     MADELEINE
                         That's not so!

                                     LOUISON
                         He writes books so wicked -- so black 
                         with evil -- that one man killed his 
                         wife, after reading 'em...

                                     GUERIN
                         And two young mothers miscarried 
                         their babies!

                                     LOUISON
                         I'd say that's murder enough.

                                     MADELEINE
                         If you're going to slander him, then 
                         you don't deserve to hear his stories --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (an accusation)
                         I think she's sweet on him, that's 
                         what I think.

               GUERIN -- meanwhile -- has groped beneath MICHETTE's blouse 
               and now fondles her breast. She purrs and glances at MADELEINE 
               with a little half-smile:

                                     MICHETTE
                         It's not the Marquis she's sweet on; 
                         Is it, Madeleine?

               MADELEINE gives MICHETTE a playful slap, and the TWO GIRLS 
               burst into giggles.

               ANGLE ON: THE LINEN PANTRY, A FEW FEET AWAY

               In the wall, the discernible shape of an old wooden door 
               with wrought-iron hinges. Clearly, it was once a portal, but 
               it was plastered shut long ago. In its knotty, rotting wood -- 
               where the hinge meets the stone -- a tiny gap. Peeping through 
               it -- spying on the FOURSOME -- BOUCHON. A low GRUNT as he 
               pleasures himself in the dark.

               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The HORSES' HOOVES of the DOCTOR's carriage cut into the 
               dirt; mud flies as it barrels on its way.

               INT. A CORRIDOR IN CHARENTON - THE NEXT MORNING

               MADELEINE is slipping fresh linen through the traps in each 
               cell door. She reaches the last one.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Fresh linens.

               A HAND reaches out to grab hers. It's heavily powdered, and 
               wears an amber ring with an arachnid trapped in stone.

                                     THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                         I'm hungry for a proper visit.

                                     MADELEINE
                              (holding her own)
                         Don't start --

                                     THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                         Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it 
                         through my tiny hole...

               The HAND lets her go. MADELEINE rises, cautiously looking 
               about. She reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a 
               key. She inserts it in the lock; it turns.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               MADELEINE enters. Upon first glance, it's less like a hospital 
               room than the apartment of a faded aristocrat. On the walls, 
               sketches of courtesans in erotic poses, culled from Justine 
               and Juliette. On the bookshelf, medical volumes: The History 
               of Madness, Lateau's Illustrated Anatomy, and Diseases of 
               the Bowel. In the corner, a foot-stool carved from human 
               bone. And -- atop an ornate wooden desk, mottled with ink-
               stains -- an explosion of quills. But no sign of the MARQUIS.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Marquis? Where'd you get to, then?

               Tentatively, MADELEINE proceeds toward the bedroom.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               A large canopied bed -- its velvet drapes closed -- beckons 
               to MADELEINE with the ominous allure of an open casket. She 
               extends a trembling hand to part the curtains.

               ANGLE ON: THE BED. It's empty. But -- rearing up behind 
               MADELEINE -- a SHADOW.

                                     VOICE
                         Well....?

               MADELEINE whirls around to face the MARQUIS. He steps into a 
               halo of light. Given his years of incarceration, he's still 
               dressed in the finery of Louis XIV, though its become frayed 
               and off-color. His wig is immaculately coifed but thin with 
               age. Still, there's something sensual about him; perhaps 
               it's the odor of decadence, which lingers over him like 
               perfume.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Did I frighten you?

                                     MADELEINE
                         You? Frighten me? That's a good one! 
                         I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd 
                         have thought such a spent body can 
                         still boast such a fertile mind?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's the only frontier I have left, 
                         plumcake.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I suppose you want to know about 
                         that silly book of yours.

               MADELEINE can't restrain herself any longer; she smiles, and 
               pulls a small bag -- heavy with coins -- from her apron 
               pocket.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It sold like the devil, 'fore they 
                         started burning it.

               She tosses the bag to THE MARQUIS, who catches it and grins:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The peril of composing such incendiary 
                         prose...

                                     MADELEINE
                         I put myself at life and limb. Surely 
                         that's worth a few louis.

               The MARQUIS rummages in the pouch for some money.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         If only these coins purchased your 
                         other talents, too.

                                     MADELEINE
                         There's something else I want from 
                         you.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You've already stolen my heart, as 
                         well as another more prominent organ, 
                         south of the Equator...

                                     MADELEINE
                         Your publisher says I'm not to leave 
                         without a new manuscript.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I've just the story... inspired by 
                         these very surroundings....

               The MARQUIS dislodges a stone from the wall, and pulls out a 
               scroll of pages, then blows on them. Dust fills the air.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry 
                         lass, the darling of the lower wards, 
                         where they entomb the criminally 
                         insane.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Is it awfully violent?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Most assuredly.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Is it terribly erotic?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Fiendishly so.

               MADELEINE squeals with delight.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         But it comes with a price.

               MADELEINE's face pales a bit. What might that be?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         A kiss for each page.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Must I administer them directly, or 
                         might I blow them?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (cooing low in her 
                              ear)
                         The price, my coquette, is every bit 
                         as firm as I am...

                                     MADELEINE
                              (with a nervous giggle)
                         Oh, you. You talk same as you write.

               She blows a wayward curl from her face, and leans in to kiss 
               THE MARQUIS. A quick peck. He passes her a single page. She 
               takes it, shuts her eyes, and puckers her lips again. This 
               time, THE MARQUIS traces her lower lip with his forefinger. 
               MADELEINE trembles, partly in fear, partly with pleasure. 
               Then he plants a kiss on her lips. He inserts his tongue -- 
               forcefully -- and her eyes pop open in surprise.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CHARENTON - MEANWHILE

               As COULMIER makes his rounds, he encounters CLEANTE, "the 
               bird man." CLEANTE carries a tiny cage, complete with a 
               warbling BIRD. CLEANTE gives a little trill. COULMIER smiles.

                                     COULMIER
                         What are we today, Cleante? A 
                         bullfinch, or a nightengale?

                                     CLEANTE
                         There's but one kind of bird in a 
                         madhouse, Abbe.

               COULMIER notices -- at the end of the hall -- the door to 
               the MARQUIS's cell is ajar. Concern flashes across his face.

                                     COULMIER
                         Don't tell me: a loon. Sorry. I've 
                         heard that one before --

               And with that, he heads down the hall to investigate.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/BEDROOM - MEANWHILE

               AN EVER-GROWING PILE OF PAPERS

               MADELEINE draws back from the MARQUIS; her breasts rise and 
               fall under her blouse. THE MARQUIS' eyes flare with hunger.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's a long story, this one.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The climax comes at a higher cost; 
                         you must sit on my lap.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You demand a lot from your readers, 
                         you do.

               She gathers her skirts, and crawls into his lap. As she 
               fidgets to get comfortable, the MARQUIS gives a low, 
               pleasurable moan. He passes her another page.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The story's thrilling conclusion 
                         comes at a premium.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What's that then?

               He grabs her breasts, tight as a vice, and hisses:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (low and hypnotic:)
                         Your maidenhead. And then you must 
                         sew it up as tightly as the day you 
                         were born, and come back to me renewed 
                         so I can deflower it a second time.

               MADELEINE wriggles out of his grasp, and SLAPS him, hard.

               The MARQUIS is stunned, but impressed by her gumption.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Some things belong on paper, others 
                         in life. It's a blessed fool who 
                         can't tell the difference.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mademoiselle LeClerc.

               COULMIER stands in the doorway, looking none too pleased.

               Quickly, MADELEINE shoves the manuscript under her blouse.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You're in the nick of time. This old 
                         lech forgot himself. He thought I 
                         was a character in one of his nasty 
                         stories!

               She heads out the door, clutching the manuscript against her 
               bosom. COULMIER ducks out after her.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He steals a moment alone with her:

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine --

                                     MADELEINE
                         Yes, Abbe?

                                     COULMIER
                         The next time you feel the urge to 
                         visit the Marquis, I hope you'll 
                         come to confession instead.

               MADELEINE nods, contrite, and slips out. COULMIER turns to 
               find THE MARQUIS standing right behind him.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?

                                     COULMIER
                         It's not even noon --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Conversation, like certain portions 
                         of the anatomy, always runs more 
                         smoothly when it's lubricated.

               Glug, glug, glug as the MARQUIS pours two glasses of wine.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's a rare vintage from an obscure 
                         village in Bordeaux. Rather than 
                         crush the grape underfoot, they place 
                         the fruit on the belly of a bride 
                         and reap its juices when the young 
                         husband steers his vessel into port.

               He sniffs his glass rapturously, then passes one to COULMIER:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         A full-bodied flavor with just a 
                         hint of wantonness? Bottom's up!

               COULMIER takes the glass. THE MARQUIS watches; will he gag? 
               Will he spit it out? COULMIER sips. He swallows. Finally:

                                     COULMIER
                         It's from our own cellar. I recognize 
                         the taste.

               THE MARQUIS' face falls.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I should've told you it was the blood 
                         of Christ; you'd believe that, 
                         wouldn't you?

                                     COULMIER
                         We treat you well enough here, don't 
                         we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, 
                         in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique 
                         writing desk, all the way from 
                         LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an 
                         ostrich --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (grumbling)
                         It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled 
                         me pink.

                                     COULMIER
                         In exchange, we ask only that you 
                         follow the rules. Now you know as 
                         well as I do... you're not to 
                         entertain visitors in your quarters.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?

                                     COULMIER
                         I'm not a beautiful young prospect, 
                         ripe for corruption.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't be so sure.

               COULMIER's amused in spite of himself. THE MARQUIS laughs, 
               too, only with a slightly sinister edge.

                                     COULMIER
                         Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge 
                         these wicked thoughts of yours on 
                         paper; maybe they'll govern you less 
                         in life.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (with a smile)
                         I'll fill page after page, I promise.

               COULMIER raises his glass in a friendly toast:

                                     COULMIER
                         Cheers.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MEANWHILE

               The swiftness of the COACH makes the ground quake.

               INT. CHARENTON - THE ART STUDIO - LATER

               COULMIER reads from a large parchment scroll with a Royal 
               wax Seal, newly-broken. VALCOUR stands by, anxious.

                                     VALCOUR
                         They've got no right, sending someone 
                         to sit on your shoulder. I work for 
                         you; I won't take orders from a 
                         stranger.

                                     COULMIER
                              (brightly; hiding 
                              concern)
                         You needn't worry, Valcour. It's 
                         administrative, nothing more.

               VALCOUR watches COULMIER, unconvinced, as the ABBE rolls up 
               the scroll, tucks it under his arm, and strolls among the 
               PATIENTS, dressed in smocks and painting at easels. He gently 
               chastises one LUNATIC who's chewing on his brush:

                                     COULMIER
                         Please don't eat the paint, Pascal.

               Next, he steps forward to inspect a painting by DAUPHIN, a 
               cheery fellow with severe burns on much of his face. The 
               canvas depicts a grisly scene; a desperate father shepherds 
               his children out of a burning house, his robes ablaze.

                                     COULMIER
                         Bravo, Dauphin. It's far better to 
                         paint fires than to set them, isn't 
                         it?

               DAUPHIN grins, happy for COULMIER's approval. A joyous burst 
               of the Papae Marcelli mass.

               INT. CHARENTON - CHAPEL

               A ROW OF HAUNTED, RUINED FACES. But -- from deep in their 
               souls -- AN ASTONISHINGLY BEAUTIFUL SOUND, like a choir of 
               angels. COULMIER conducts, jubilant. As the music soars, it 
               seems to transform -- even redeem -- the singers. MADELEINE 
               watches -- admiringly -- from the corner.

               EXT. CHARENTON TERRACE AND GROUNDS - MEANWHILE

               The RUMBLE of HOOVES. The DOCTOR's COACH -- with its Gothic 
               accoutrement -- lurches into the drive. GAILLON hops off, 
               and opens the door. ROYER-COLLARD disembarks. Emanating from 
               within, the EXHILARATING MUSIC. The DOCTOR and GAILLON 
               exchange a look; have they come to the right place?

               INT. CHARENTON - CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

               As COULMIER conducts, he notices several SINGERS are 
               distracted; they're staring past him, all the way down the 
               nave. He turns to see ROYER-COLLARD, flanked by GAILLON and 
               VALCOUR, in the doorway. VALCOUR shoots COULMIER a look that 
               says "He's here." COULMIER turns, and silences the choir 
               with a smile.

                                     COULMIER
                         That's all for today, thank-you.

               The CHOIR disperses. COULMIER bounds down the aisle, his arm 
               outstretched in welcome. MADELEINE lingers, listening.

                                     COULMIER
                         Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first 
                         to welcome you to Charenton --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         This may feel a tad awkward, my 
                         friend, but it needn't be. I've merely 
                         come to oversee your work here; 
                         understood?

                                     COULMIER
                         Of course.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It's a formality; truly.

                                     COULMIER
                         You're a man of Science; I'm a man 
                         of God. Charenton stands to profit 
                         from us both, I'm certain.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I'll need an office on the grounds; 
                         someplace to store my things.

                                     COULMIER
                              (a hint of anxiety)
                         If you don't mind my asking... why 
                         has the Emperor taken such sudden 
                         interest in my... our... affairs?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It seems a particular patient of 
                         yours has captured his fancy.

               THE MARQUIS, VIEWED THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE OF HIS CELL DOOR

               HE RAILS AGAINST THE WORLD:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Why, why, WHY should this be happening 
                         to me?!

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               A TRIO OF LUNATICS, REHEARSING A PLAY IN THE MARQUIS' COMPANY

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Once again, gentleman!

               FRANVAL kneels before PITOU, holding a lady's satin shoe.

               PITOU -- meanwhile -- is preoccupied with his wig; a flowing 
               cascade of golden curls. Behind them, a tawdry back-drop of 
               the French countryside. FRANVAL wreaks havoc with his lines, 
               reciting them in painfully sing-song fashion:

                                     FRANVAL
                         "I'm just a lowly cobbler, and I 
                         have been all my life. But with this 
                         shoe, I'm asking you to be a cobbler's 
                         wife --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (interrupting)
                         It's a dreadful play, true! A 
                         festering pustule on the face of 
                         literature. Why the parchment it's 
                         written upon isn't worthy to wipe my 
                         ass! BUT YOU NEED NOT MAKE IT WORSE! 
                         Say your lines with conviction, ma 
                         cherie! Like a true actor!

                                     FRANVAL
                         But I'm not an actor; I'm a dyspeptic.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Seduce her, you goon!

               INT. THE CORRIDOR - MEANWHILE

               COULMIER and ROYER-COLLARD confer, en route to THE MARQUIS' 
               CELL.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I understand he practices the very 
                         crimes he preaches in his fiction.

                                     COULMIER
                         A few indiscretions in his youth.

               ROYER-COLLARD cocks an eyebrow:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've 
                         read his case history. At sixteen, 
                         he violated a serving girl with a 
                         crucifix. After six months in the 
                         dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a 
                         prostitute, cutting her flesh with a 
                         razor, then cauterizing the wounds 
                         with wax --

                                     COULMIER
                         I hope you'll judge him by his 
                         progress here, and not his past 
                         reputation.

               THEY reach the cell door. ROYER-COLLARD gazes in at THE 
               MARQUIS as he would a creature at the zoo.

                                     COULMIER
                         He's made a great success of our 
                         Little Theater; there's seldom an 
                         empty seat. Not to mention its 
                         therapeutic value.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Playing dress-up with cretins? That 
                         sounds like a symptom of madness; 
                         not its cure.

               Suddenly, THE MARQUIS rears up in the peephole to confront 
               ROYER-COLLARD face-to-face.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Homo perversio, Doctor. A species 
                         that thrives in captivity.

               Their eyes meet; flicker of recognition passes between them. 
               Doppelgangers, meeting for the first time. COULMIER 
               interjects:

                                     COULMIER
                         This is Dr. Royer-Collard; he's 
                         joining us here in an...

               He looks to the DOCTOR for help:

                                     COULMIER
                         ...advisory capacity.

               The DOCTOR considers the word "advisory", then nods. THE 
               MARQUIS' eyebrow arches in surprise.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Welcome to our humble madhouse, 
                         Doctor. I trust you'll find yourself 
                         at home.

               And with that, he slams the peephole shut.

               INT. THE ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               COULMIER and ROYER-COLLARD make their way through the asylum. 
               High above -- along the railing of the grand staircase -- 
               MADELEINE appears, flanked by MICHETTE and CHARLOTTE. They've 
               come to size up the new DOCTOR.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Why is he in your care, and not a 
                         proper prison?

                                     COULMIER
                         His wife's influence.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         His wife's?

                                     COULMIER
                         Better to have an insane spouse than 
                         a criminal one.

               Whispers from the GIRLS above; COULMIER shoots MADELEINE a 
               look that says "behave yourself." She watches the TWO MEN 
               turn the corner.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And he's never once attempted escape?

                                     COULMIER
                         A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't 
                         last a day on the streets without 
                         capture.

               INT. THE INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

               NUNS tend PATIENTS with various maladies; others mash herbs. 
               A PHRENOLOGIST uses pincers to measure a PATIENT's scalp.

                                     COULMIER
                         Besides, every wholesome thing he 
                         might desire, he has at Charenton. A 
                         library, filled with the world's 
                         great books, music lessons, watercolor 
                         exercises --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         What is the impact of all these 
                         amenities upon his psyche?

                                     COULMIER
                         He no longer roars or spits. He no 
                         longer taunts the guards or molests 
                         his fellow wards --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And his writing?

               COULMIER suppresses a tiny smile.

                                     COULMIER
                         Oh. That.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Well...?

                                     COULMIER
                         It's essential to his recovery; a 
                         purgative for the toxins in his mind.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Do you favor its publication?

                                     COULMIER
                         For sale? To the general public? 
                         Certainly not; it's unprintable.

               DR. ROYER-COLLARD reaches inside his jacket, and pulls out a 
               copy of Justine. He hands it to the ABBE, who's dumbfounded. 
               COULMIER starts to scan the pages; the unmistakable prose of 
               you-know-who.

                                     COULMIER
                         Dear God...

               He looks up to see that the DOCTOR has moved on, strolling 
               down the hall with authority. He races to catch up.

                                     COULMIER
                         You have to believe me, I had no 
                         idea --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         All France is aghast at this book, 
                         yet you've not heard of it?

                                     COULMIER
                         I've taken vows to live my life within 
                         these walls; not outside them.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a 
                         conviction... an idealism... peculiar 
                         to the very young. And so I'll be 
                         candid. The Ministry has sent me 
                         here with the most explicit... the 
                         most severe instructions.

                                     COULMIER
                              (nervous now)
                         Yes?

               INT. CHARENTON - R.C'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               GAILLON, VALCOUR and ORVOLLE appear, bringing in paraphernalia 
               from the DOCTOR's carriage. A few items are particularly 
               menacing; a helmet for trephining; a wire sarcophagus, and 
               the nefarious calming chair. COULMIER stares at these 
               instruments of torture with a mixture of wonder and 
               foreboding.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Unless we set Charenton on a straight 
                         and narrow course, she'll be shut 
                         down forever by order of the Emperor.

                                     COULMIER
                              (disbelieving)
                         Shut down?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         In their eyes, the Marquis is the 
                         surest barometer of your progress 
                         here.

                                     COULMIER
                              (his voice rising in 
                              protest)
                         But he's one among some two hundred 
                         wards --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Have you tried bleeding him with 
                         leeches? The calming chair? Maybe 
                         you should flog him at the stake?

                                     COULMIER
                         Why? So he'll learn to fear 
                         punishment, rather than pursue virtue 
                         for its own reward?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You're a sentimental man.

                                     COULMIER
                         A practical man, sir. Given the 
                         Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound 
                         thrashing on bare flesh may not 
                         qualify as a deterrent.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You find this amusing, do you?

               COULMIER rallies passionately on his own behalf:

                                     COULMIER
                         On the contrary. Let me take up this 
                         matter with the Marquis myself --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And place my reputation at stake?

                                     COULMIER
                         Charenton is my life's work. To have 
                         her wrested from beneath me now --

               ROYER-COLLARD pauses. His face softens, and he sighs:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I've stringent standards, true, but 
                         I've something else the Ministry 
                         failed to take into account; a heart.

               COULMIER almost collapses with relief and gratitude.

                                     COULMIER
                         Thank-you, Doctor. I'll effect his 
                         contrition; you have my word.

               INT. A CORRIDOR AT CHARENTON - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

               COULMIER barrels down the hall, fuming. His head is deep in 
               the pages of the book; he almost bumps headlong into MADELEINE 
               on her morning rounds. She drops her laundry basket and 
               flattens herself against the wall:

                                     MADELEINE
                         What is it, Abbe?

               She starts dogging COULMIER down the hall.

                                     COULMIER
                         The Marquis. He's embarrassed us...
                              (with incredulity)
                         ...before Napoleon himself.

               COULMIER stops. He turns to MADELEINE, disheartened, and 
               confides the full force of THE MARQUIS' betrayal:

                                     COULMIER
                         He's been slipping manuscripts to 
                         his publisher.

               MADELEINE feigns surprise and says in a guilty voice:

                                     MADELEINE
                         He has?

               COULMIER nods -- tersely -- and marches toward THE MARQUIS' 
               door. He reaches for the key-chain on his belt.

                                     COULMIER
                         I place my trust too carelessly, 
                         Madeleine.

               Unbeknownst to COULMIER, this stings her. He turns the key 
               in the lock and enters, closing the door behind him.

               MADELEINE opens the peephole to spy on the scene which 
               follows:

               INT. THE MARQUIS'APARTMENT/DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               COULMIER storms in to find THE MARQUIS in a cloud of white 
               powder; he's dusting some fresh pages to set the ink.

               COULMIER slams the book down.

                                     COULMIER
                         This is a complete... an utter...
                              (his voice falls)
                         ...disappointment.

               THE MARQUIS fingers the book, disapprovingly:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the 
                         type's too small --

                                     COULMIER
                         What did you do? Bribe one of the 
                         guards?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         But you implored me to write! For 
                         curative purposes, to stave off my 
                         madness --

                                     COULMIER
                         But you've no right to publish! Behind 
                         my back, without my sanction!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Have you truly read the book in 
                         question? Or did you run -- 
                         straightaway -- to the dog-eared 
                         pages?

                                     COULMIER
                         Enough to discern its tenor.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         And --?

                                     COULMIER
                         It's not even a proper novel! It's 
                         nothing but an encyclopedia of 
                         perversions! Frankly, it even fails 
                         as an exercise in craft. The 
                         characters are wooden; the dialogue 
                         is inane. Not to mention the endless 
                         repetition of words like "nipple" 
                         and "pikestaff" --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         There I was taxed; it's true.

                                     COULMIER
                         And such puny scope! Nothing but the 
                         very worst in man's nature!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I write of the great, eternal truths 
                         that bind together all mankind! The 
                         whole world over, we eat, we shit, 
                         we fuck, we kill and we die.

                                     COULMIER
                         But we also fall in love; we build 
                         cities, we compose symphonies, and 
                         we endure. Why not put that in your 
                         books as well?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

                                     COULMIER
                         But isn't that the duty of art? To 
                         elevate us above the beast?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I thought that was your duty, Abbe, 
                         not mine.

                                     COULMIER
                         One more trick like this, and I'll 
                         be forced to revoke all your 
                         liberties!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? 
                         He's come to usurp your place here, 
                         hasn't he?

                                     COULMIER
                              (blurting the truth)
                         More than your writing's at stake. 
                         The Ministry has threatened us with 
                         closure.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         They can't be serious.

                                     COULMIER
                         Our future lies in the stroke of 
                         your pen.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (impressed, even 
                              flattered)
                         Mightier than the sword indeed.

                                     COULMIER
                         Put yourself in my place. I've your 
                         fellow patients to consider. If 
                         Charenton falls, they've no place to 
                         go. No manner in which to clothe or 
                         feed themselves --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and 
                         pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, 
                         as Nature intended.

                                     COULMIER
                         You among them?

               This gives THE MARQUIS pause; COULMIER has a point.

                                     COULMIER
                              (his most passionate 
                              plea yet)
                         If ever I showed you a kind hand, 
                         Marquis.... If ever I granted you 
                         walking privileges on a Spring day, 
                         or slipped an extra pillow beneath 
                         your door... if ever I shared your 
                         wine, laughed at your vulgarities, 
                         or humored you with argument... then 
                         you will oblige me now. For your 
                         sake, and for all Charenton.

               THE MARQUIS -- seemingly touched -- says quietly:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You've a touch of the poet, too; 
                         perhaps you should take up the quill.

                                     COULMIER
                              (undaunted)
                         Do I have your word?

               THE MARQUIS catches MADELEINE's reflection in his mirror.

               In her face, the question: "What on earth are you going to 
               do?" He winks at her.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Have no fear, Abbe.

               He turns back to COULMIER. He has the open, honest eyes of a 
               Spaniel, but his words are double-edged:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I swear; all that Charenton has given 
                         me, I'll repay a hundred-fold.

               MADELEINE's eyes grow wide with wonder at the prospect.

                                     COULMIER
                         If you only mean to dupe me again --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (indignant now)
                         Honestly! You cut me to the core! 
                         What's the point of all your valiant 
                         attempts at rehabilitation if -- 
                         when I finally succumb -- when at 
                         long last, I pledge myself to 
                         righteous conduct -- you regard me 
                         with nothing but suspicion? Have you 
                         no faith in your own medicine?

               COULMIER smiles; THE MARQUIS has a point.

                                     COULMIER
                              (reassured)
                         Thank-you.

               INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' CELL - MEANWHILE

               MADELEINE slides the peephole shut. She hears a sound; staring 
               at her intensely from the opposite end of the hall, ROYER-
               COLLARD.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         My, my. At Charenton, even the walls 
                         have eyes.

                                     MADELEINE
                              (under her breath)
                         Mmmm... don't they?

               She scoops up her laundry and barrels on her way. COULMIER 
               leaves the MARQUIS and steps into the hall. He's surprised 
               to see the DOCTOR.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Well?

                                     COULMIER
                         I spoke to him with reason and 
                         compassion; the tools which serve us 
                         best here.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And --?

                                     COULMIER
                         He's sworn to obedience.

               The DOCTOR -- ever doubtful -- mutters "tsk, tsk, tsk," and 
               turns to leave; COULMIER calls after him, insistent:

                                     COULMIER
                         He's more than a patient, Doctor; 
                         the Marquis is my friend --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You keep strange company, Abbe. But 
                         if you truly have matters in hand 
                         here --

                                     COULMIER
                         I have.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         -- then I've friends of my own to 
                         visit.

               ANGLE ON: THE MARQUIS, watching, ever-watching, from the 
               hole in his door.

               EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE

               The THUNDER of HOOVES. The DOCTOR's COACH takes a hair-pin 
               turn at a furious pace.

               EXT. THE PANTHEMONT CONVENT - MOMENTS LATER

               ROYER-COLLARD stands beneath the convent's trellis, and pounds 
               on the door. It opens, revealing the MOTHER SUPERIOR -- SISTER 
               NOIRCEUIL -- a severe-looking nun in a wimple.

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         Yes?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I've come for my bride.

               INT. PANTHEMONT CONVENT/CLOISTERS - CONTINUOUS

               SISTER NOIRCEUIL leads ROYER-COLLARD down the corridor; a 
               heavy set of keys dangles from the belt around her waist.

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         We'd not expected you for some time. 
                         Simone has not yet come of age.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I've taken a new post at Charenton; 
                         I need the succor only a wife can 
                         provide.

               They arrive at the room of the convent's ward, SIMONE.

               INT. PANTHEMONT CONVENT - SIMONE'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

               They interrupt the GIRL in prayer before a porcelain figure 
               of the MADONNA; she rises. With her doe-like eyes and cherubic 
               skin, SIMONE could be the DOCTOR's daughter as readily as 
               his wife.

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         You remember Dr. Royer-Collard.

               SIMONE blushes, and casts her eyes downward.

                                     SIMONE
                         I'd not forget the man to whom I was 
                         promised.

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         He's come to collect you.

                                     SIMONE
                              (with alarm:)
                         Today? This minute?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         My apologies, Mademoiselle; I'd no 
                         time to write.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE PANTHEMONT CONVENT - MINUTES LATER

               SIMONE stands in her traveling cape, clutching her MADONNA, 
               ROYER-COLLARD beside her. A CLUSTER of NUNS has gathered to 
               bid SIMONE adieu; among them, the twins SISTER FLAVIE and 
               SISTER ROSE FATIMA. The MOTHER SUPERIOR hands SIMONE a small 
               valise:

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         Be grateful, child. It's my experience 
                         that most poor girls who are orphaned 
                         never wed; They wind up spinsters, 
                         or worse still... nuns.

               She takes SIMONE by the chin; her fingers are talons.

                                     SISTER NOIRCEUIL
                         Thank God that Fortune has spared 
                         you from such a Fate.

               SISTER NOIRCEUIL bows her head toward ROYER-COLLARD, giving 
               him permission to go. He extends his arm to SIMONE.

               Hesitantly, she takes it. He guides her toward the waiting 
               carriage. SISTER NOIRCEUIL is grimly pleased. SISTER FLAVIE 
               and SISTER ROSE FATIMA exchange a look of grave concern.

                                     SISTER ROSE FATIMA
                         Good-bye, Simone.

                                     SISTER FLAVIE
                         God bless, Simone.

               EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - A SHORT TIME LATER

               The DOCTOR's carriage lurches down the cobblestone road.

               INT. THE DOCTOR'S CARRIAGE

               ROYER-COLLARD sits stiffly by his new bride; she stares out 
               the window. Looming on the horizon, a towering chateau.

               SIMONE's eyes grow wide with wonder. TWO MEN stand outside, 
               waiting to greet them, with their own carriage and driver 
               standing by.

                                     DELBENÈ (O.S.)
                         The Emperor wishes to ensure your 
                         comfort while at Charenton.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU - CONTINUOUS

               Delbenè accompanies ROYER-COLLARD and SIMONE across the drive 
               toward the chateau.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         Consider the chateau a gift, provided 
                         you're willing to finance the 
                         necessary repairs.

               The DOCTOR assesses his new home up-close; it's fallen into 
               grave disuse. Practically a ruin. Delbenè gestures to MONSIEUR 
               PROUIX, a dimpled young fellow, nattily dressed.

                                     DELBENÈ
                         Monsieur Prouix is the court's most 
                         promising young architect; he's at 
                         your disposal.

               MONSIEUR PROUIX offers a friendly grin; the DOCTOR gives him 
               the cursory once-over.

               INT. THE CHATEAU - ATRIUM

               The THREE MEN enter, SIMONE a few paces behind. An opulent 
               space, fallen into desuetude: a marble floor with matching 
               columns, a domed ceiling, and an expansive staircase.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (dryly)
                         It has possibilities, yes. Simone?

               SIMONE flinches, surprised the DOCTOR is addressing her so 
               publicly. She says in a voice hushed with awe:

                                     SIMONE
                         I'm to live here?

               ROYER-COLLARD moves toward the stairs; something catches his 
               attention. Underfoot, a huge, crimson stain, rimmed in yellow. 
               The DOCTOR gets down on his haunches and runs a hands over 
               it. He glances up at Delbenè, his face a question mark.

                                     DELBENÈ
                              (coldly)
                         The place hasn't been occupied since 
                         the Terror; it belonged to the Duc 
                         de Blangis, an avowed monarchist. 
                         The Jacobins were most... unforgiving.

               Lying askance, a moldy old shoe with a cracked heel.

               Delbenè sidles up to ROYER-COLLARD and says confidentially:

                                     DELBENÈ
                         His wife was trying to escape; they 
                         caught her on the stair, and set 
                         upon her with bayonets.
                              (shuddering)
                         "There but for the grace of God"... 
                         eh, Doctor?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I don't shed tears over the past, 
                         Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the 
                         future.

               ROYER-COLLARD stands and turns to PROUIX:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         We'd best quarry fresh marble, don't 
                         you think?

               PROUIX dutifully makes a note.

               INT. THE CHATEAU - UPPER ATRIUM

               ROYER-COLLARD coaxes PROUIX aside for a confidential 
               conversation:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You're to humor my wife in all things. 
                         If she wants Venetian glass, she's 
                         to have it. Italian tile, Dutch 
                         velvet; spare no expense.
                              (lowering his voice 
                              to a whisper)
                         But in her bedchamber, see to it 
                         that the door locks from the outside. 
                         And on her windows... an iron grate.

                                     PROUIX
                         Bars, sir?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         In the convent, Simone was spared 
                         the world's temptations. I won't 
                         have her falling prey to them now.

               ROYER-COLLARD glances over the railing, down below; SIMONE 
               stands, overwhelmed, in the enormous atrium. Over her head, 
               the beating of wings.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         She's a rare bird; I intend to keep 
                         her caged.

               SIMONE'S POV: TRAPPED WHITE DOVES flap their feathers madly, 
               trying to get through the glass above.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PANTHEMONT CONVENT - AFTERNOON

               LOUISON and GUERIN have come to exchange alms for candles 
               from the nuns who make them, SISTER ROSE FATIMA and SISTER 
               FLAVIE. The BOYS load boxes onto the asylum cart. They gossip:

                                     GUERIN
                         No!

                                     SISTER ROSE FATIMA
                         It's a scandal, truly. Him, pretending 
                         to be a God-fearing man!

                                     SISTER FLAVIE
                         And that's not all; he's far too old 
                         to marry, and she's far too young --

               LOUISON and GUERIN exchange a grin.

               INT. LAUNDRY - LATER

               GUERIN whispers the tale to a gloriously naked MICHETTE, as 
               he makes love to her in the straw. His words are interspersed 
               with gasps and moans.

                                     MICHETTE
                         No!

                                     GUERIN
                         -- I say -- the comely little thing -- 
                         is barely sixteen --

               MICHETTE giggles, and turns to her left. There -- surprise --  
               lies LOUISON, pleasuring her from the other side.

                                     LOUISON
                         -- I say -- ah! -- she's even younger --

               INT. THE SERVANT'S QUARTERS - LATER

               MICHETTE -- in her knickers -- now relays the story to 
               MADELEINE. CHARLOTTE glowers, always the odd one out.

                                     MADELEINE
                         No!

                                     MICHETTE
                         -- from a convent, no less; she was 
                         meant to be a nun --

               INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' CELL - THAT NIGHT

               MADELEINE stands on her overturned basket, whispering to THE 
               MARQUIS through the peephole. Her lips are luscious rubies 
               in his ear:

                                     MADELEINE
                         -- he's old enough to have fathered 
                         her twice over --

               THE MARQUIS' eyes spark with inspiration.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Why, the hypocrite. It has all the 
                         makings of a farce, hasn't it? Run 
                         straightaway, and tell Franval to 
                         cancel rehearsal...

               CLOSE UP: A MAGNIFICENT WHITE QUILL PEN.

               As he blithely hums "Claire de la Lune," THE MARQUIS dips 
               the quill into his ink well; the liquid shoots up the 
               feather's shaft, turning it a deep purple color.

               On his PARCHMENT, in calligraphic script, the words "The 
               Crimes of Love: A Play in Several Lascivious Acts..."

               THE MARQUIS' little tune rises all the way to symphonic tones, 
               and we fade up to...

               EXT. CHARENTON TERRACE - EVENING

               Tonight the place looks less like a madhouse and more like 
               the Comèdie Francaise. Mingling on the steps, bejeweled 
               DOWAGERS and GENTLEMEN in frock-coats. Flanking COULMIER, 
               two GRAND DAMES: MADAME BOUGIVAL and MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL, 
               who's never without her small LAPDOG, even at the theater.

               They bill and coo around the comely priest like magpies.

                                     MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL
                         Abbe de Coulmier! You rascal! Your 
                         comedies have become quite the rage; 
                         I had to claw my way to a ticket.

                                     COULMIER
                         I can hardly take credit --

                                     MADAME BOUGIVAL
                              (interrupting the 
                              ABBE)
                         And so expertly acted! That charming 
                         young man in last week's comedy...
                              (sotto voce)
                         ...I'd no idea he was an imbecile!

                                     COULMIER
                         Everyone has talents, if we look for 
                         them.

                                     MADAME BOUGIVAL
                              (appraising the ABBE)
                         Mmm. Yes. I'm sure.

               COULMIER notices ROYER-COLLARD mounting the steps with SIMONE. 
               In her finery, SIMONE looks less like a society bride, and 
               more like a child playing dress-up. COULMIER gives the DOCTOR 
               a cordial wave. ROYER-COLLARD nods, curtly.

                                     MADAME BOUGIVAL
                         Is that the new Doctor? You must be 
                         thrilled. Such a renowned expert, 
                         right here, at Charenton!

                                     COULMIER
                              (evasively)
                         Ah! Curtain time.

                                     MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL
                         I'll say one thing for him; he has a 
                         beautiful daughter.

               ANGLE ON: A CARRIAGE, PULLING UP TO THE STEPS. A MYSTERIOUS 
               WOMAN disembarks. She's in her middle years, with a dark 
               bonnet to disguise her identity. She ascends the steps to 
               CHARENTON.

               CLOSE UP: A PLACARD FOR "THE HAPPY SHOEMAKER"

               A hand crumples it; tears it up.

               FRAME WIDENS

               and we see it's THE MARQUIS. He's in the linen pantry, which 
               has been jerry-rigged as a BACKSTAGE AREA for the evening's 
               Little Theater Peformance, which will take place in the 
               laundry. Poised near him, the Stage Manager for the evening, 
               MADELEINE. They exchange a conspiratorial glance; tonight's 
               performance is going to go splendidly! THE MARQUIS surveys 
               the LUNATIC CAST spread out before him, readying their night 
               of glory.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Remember, gentlemen! Inside each of 
                         your delicate minds... your 
                         distinctive bodies... ART is waiting 
                         to be born. So let's give the Doctor 
                         a performance I hope he'll remember 
                         forever...

               The CAST gives a rallying cry; THE MARQUIS turns and peers 
               out the tattered velvet curtains.

               MARQUIS' POV: The catacombs have been converted into a make-
               shift theater-in-the-round. The place has a slightly sinister 
               feel; one of Dante's lower circles. A primitive platform 
               stage has been erected in the spot customarily held by MADAME 
               LECLERC's vat.

               The SOCIETY FOLK sit on benches alongside the FEEBLE and the 
               DAMNED. THE LUNATIC QUARTET plays its bizarre instruments: 
               18th century curled horns, and home-made strings. A grinning 
               DAUPHIN lights the torches that will illuminate the stage. 
               From the AUDIENCE, excited twitters.

               A grand night for slumming among the loons! A bacchanal!

               He sees RENEE PELAGIE take her seat, and lower her hood, 
               craning her neck for a sight of the man she loves. Next, he 
               marks ROYER-COLLARD, sitting on a newly-erected dais next to 
               his lovely wife SIMONE. COULMIER sits at the DOCTOR's 
               shoulder, pointing out various notables in the crowd:

                                     COULMIER
                         Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- 
                         and of course -- the Marquis' wife --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (evincing interest)
                         Oh indeed?

               Meanwhile -- backstage -- FRANVAL nervously taps the MARQUIS 
               on the shoulder:

                                     FRANVAL
                         Begging your pardon; it's time to 
                         begin.

               THE MARQUIS drops the curtain, and reminds FRANVAL:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The dedication, word for word; it's 
                         every bit as crucial as the play 
                         which follows --

               FRANVAL nods and takes a deep breath. He bounds onto the 
               stage.

                                     FRANVAL
                              (his voice quavering)
                         Madames and Messieurs, there's been 
                         a change in tonight's program.

               ANGLE ON: COULMIER, who stiffens with apprehension. This is 
               an unexpected development.

                                     FRANVAL
                         We will not be performing The Happy 
                         Shoemaker.

               From the AUDIENCE, stirs and murmurs. Perhaps a few 
               disappointed sighs. From the wings, THE MARQUIS gestures for 
               FRANVAL to take a few significant steps forward, toward the 
               DOCTOR.

                                     FRANVAL
                         Instead, we'd like to premiere a new 
                         play in honor of the newly-appointed 
                         Dr. Royer-Collard and his lovely 
                         bride, married nary a week today --

               ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD AND HIS WIFE. The DOCTOR smiles at 
               SIMONE, and touches her hand, fondly. A polite smattering of 
               applause.

               ANGLE ON: FRANVAL

                                     FRANVAL
                         -- a comedy entitled...

               He dries up. From backstage, THE MARQUIS hisses:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         The Crimes of Love!

                                     FRANVAL
                         ...The Crimes of Love, written by 
                         one of Charenton's very own wards!

               FRANVAL glances back at THE MARQUIS. THE AUDIENCE follows 
               suit. The moment they see SADE, they break into even louder 
               applause than they gave ROYER-COLLARD. The asylum's most 
               notorious inmate! Right here, before their very eyes!

               In a show of false modesty, THE MARQUIS blushes, steps out 
               from behind the curtain, and gives a cursory little bow.

               ROYER-COLLARD glances back at COULMIER as if to say "What's 
               this?" COULMIER starts fingering his rosary in nervous 
               anticipation. RENEE PELAGIE just closes her eyes.

               ANGLE ON: THE STAGE AS THE BAND PLAYS

               A LUNATIC dressed as an ANGEL sits high atop one ladder, and 
               a DEVIL on another. Together, the TWO start pummeling the 
               stage with artificial snow. BOUCHON stands in the wings, 
               heaving a giant set of bellows, creating the North Wind.

               INT. BACKSTAGE

               MADELEINE rushes to ready the cast; DAUPHIN is dressed as a 
               MOTHER SUPERIOR; he looks markedly like Sister Noirceuil of 
               the Panthemont Convent. Behind him, PITOU is the FEMALE 
               INGENUE; a veritable Simone. He cries out for his bonnet:

                                     PITOU
                         My hat, my hat!

               MADELEINE afixes his hat, hands PITOU and DAUPHIN each a 
               hobby horse, and pushes them toward the STAGE.

               ANGLE: ONSTAGE

               DAUPHIN and PITOU ride down the ramp which leads from the 
               linen pantry onto the wooden stage...

                                     INGENUE
                         Oh Sister Saint-Fond, whither do we 
                         go? Passing o'er rivers, canyons and 
                         snow?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Hurry, Eugenie, for we must not tarry; 
                         I deliver you now to the man you 
                         shall marry!

               ANGLE ON: SIMONE

               Her girlish face alive with pleasure, charmed by the spectacle 
               before her.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Once you have rested, at your leisure -- 
                         he'll coach you in the ways of 
                         pleasure.

               A RIPPLE through the AUDIENCE; tonight's performance is 
               saucier than usual. As DAUPHIN and PITOU move offstage, 
               BOUCHON collects their hobby horses.

               TWO LUNATICS enter, covered in ornate vines. They form an 
               ARCHWAY. With a drum roll and a thunder-clap, CLEANTE rises 
               from the AUDIENCE -- just a few seats away from ROYER-COLLARD --  
               and hops onstage to assume the role of THE LIBERTINE. GASPS 
               of SURPRISE from the crowd. He wears a coat and hat that 
               match the DOCTOR's.

               PITOU and DAUPHIN re-enter from the wings.

                                     LIBERTINE
                         At last she arrives, my hard-won 
                         bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry 
                         inside. There you'll find such 
                         treasures await you; Marzipan and 
                         meringue to sate you!

                                     INGENUE
                         Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- 
                         a rarity; How lucky I am to receive 
                         his charity!

               The INGENUE ducks through the HUMAN ARCHWAY into the imagined 
               CHATEAU. The LIBERTINE passes the MOTHER SUPERIOR a comically 
               large purse.

                                     LIBERTINE
                         Thank you, dear Sister, for abetting 
                         me so; Bringing her here to this 
                         secluded Chateau! Little does she 
                         know the terrors in store; when I 
                         tutor her in --

               He leans into ROYER-COLLARD for this last bit:

                                     LIBERTINE
                         ...les crimes de l'amour!

               ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD. He glances all the way past the 
               play, through the AUDIENCE seated in the opposite bank.

               There -- looming in the back row against the wall -- THE 
               MARQUIS, who grins; the poison arrow has hit his mark. The 
               DOCTOR -- ever composed, grins back. An even-handed challenge 
               that says "I know what you're up to; you're only dooming 
               yourself." Slyly, THE MARQUIS slips behind a column, 
               disappearing from view.

               ROYER-COLLARD whispers to SIMONE:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Leave at once --

                                     SIMONE
                         But it's just begun --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Do as I say.

               A forlorn SIMONE exits; GAILLON escorts her toward the door.

               ANGLE ON: THE DOOR

               As SIMONE and GAILLON slip toward the exit, THE MARQUIS stands 
               waiting for them. He casts a knowing glance at SIMONE, then 
               wisecracks to GAILLON:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Leaving so soon? Oh, but of course! 
                         You've seen it before.

               GAILLON just glares and hurries SIMONE up the stairs.

               ANGLE: ONSTAGE

               The play continues, full-throttle: BOUCHON pushes a bed 
               onstage. The INGENUE cowers on the mattress; the LIBERTINE 
               leaps upon her.

                                     LIBERTINE
                         Quickly, my suckling, out of your 
                         clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid 
                         it grows!

                                     INGENUE
                         Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! 
                         You're not my lover; you're a 
                         monstrous rouè!

               The LIBERTINE yanks up the INGENUE's legs and dives beneath 
               her skirts. From beneath the fabric, a host of VULGAR SOUNDS.

                                     LIBERTINE
                         Do as I say! Stick your legs in the 
                         air! It's true, I'm a pig and you've 
                         truffles down there --

               This is all COULMIER can bear; he rises from his seat, in 
               pursuit of THE MARQUIS. He aims for the door, but THE MARQUIS 
               has already disappeared. COULMIER starts scanning the crowd, 
               hoping to find him in the sea of faces.

               ANGLE ON: RENEE PELAGIE

               She turns, aware of her husband's presence somewhere behind 
               her. MADAME BOUGIVAL says loudly to MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL:

                                     MADAME BOUGIVAL
                         Who do you suppose is to blame? The 
                         author... or his Muse?

               RENEE's face falls, stricken. MADAME BOUGIVAL and MADEMOISELLE 
               CLAIRWIL titter behind their fans.

               ANGLE: ONSTAGE

               THE LIBERTINE continues to pleasure THE INGENUE with his 
               mouth:

                                     INGENUE
                              (her tone changing)
                         Good heavens, what's this? Such a 
                         wicked sensation! A feeling somewhere 
                         between shame and elation! Yes! That's 
                         the way; use your tongue like a wand 
                         in much the same manner as Sister 
                         Saint-Fond!

               INT. BACKSTAGE

               MADELEINE scurries about, readying the LUNATIC CAST for the 
               Second Act: A FAUX NAPOLEON, A MALE NUN, FRANVAL, DAUPHIN 
               and a LOON DRESSED AS JESUS CHRIST.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Quickly; the second act!

               They exit onto the stage. MADELEINE is alone now backstage. 
               Or so it seems, until BOUCHON looms up behind her in the 
               darkness.

               BOUCHON's POV: MADELEINE peer through the curtains at the 
               performance. He admires the nape of her neck; her soft 
               shoulders. Meanwhile -- onstage -- the play moves apace:

                                     THE LIBERTINE
                         I had a suspicion the Sister was 
                         Sapphic!

                                     THE INGENUE
                         I'd tell you more, but it's simply 
                         too graphic. Suffice it to say, she's 
                         a preference for lasses! Even at 
                         Vespers, she always made passes --

               ANGLE ON: MADELEINE

               Suddenly, BOUCHON's hands appears around the base of her 
               neck; his finger flicker across her cheek. Her face fills 
               with shock, and she disappears behind the curtain.

                                     LIBERTINE
                         My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! 
                         Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!

                                     INGENUE
                         Was ever a man more risquè? He wants 
                         to take me every way!

               ANGLE: BACKSTAGE

               BOUCHON yanks MADELEINE behind a curtain, and pushes her -- 
               hard -- against a stone wall. With a visceral grunt, he gropes 
               her beneath her petticoat. She gives a sharp yelp, and reaches 
               for an iron, still red-hot from the day's work.

               She presses it -- hard -- against BOUCHON's cheek. His flesh 
               sizzles.

                                     BOUCHON
                         Ahhhhhggggg...

               ANGLE: ONSTAGE

               The obscene pantomime gets wilder by the minute:

               ANGLE ON: THE AUDIENCE

               COULMIER hears BOUCHON's tortured cry, and lurches from the 
               dais, marching directly across the stage. VALCOUR leaps up 
               from his own aisle seat, and follows the PRIEST. The 
               rollicking play continues onstage:

                                     LIBERTINE
                         I'll plunder every lovely pore until 
                         you're week and cry "no more!"

                                     INGENUE
                         I tremble with fear! You're bound to 
                         pound the quivering lips of my Venus 
                         mound!

                                     LIBERTINE
                         And then -- to prove your truly mine -- 
                         I'll plunder you, darling, from 
                         behind!

                                     INGENUE
                         What of my lips, will you soil them 
                         too? When you've broken every other 
                         taboo?

                                     LIBERTINE
                         I'll fill every slippery hollow; if 
                         you're obliging, then you'll swallow!

               COULMIER rips aside the backstage curtain, revealing MADELEINE -- 
               still out of breath -- and BOUCHON, grabbing his face in 
               pain. The AUDIENCE -- giddy and oblivious -- starts to peal 
               with pleasure; they're certainly getting their money's worth 
               tonight!

               VALCOUR seizes BOUCHON roughly.

                                     COULMIER
                         Take him to the infirmary for a 
                         plaster, and an ice bath. That'll 
                         cool him.

               VALCOUR drags a quivering BOUCHON away.

                                     COULMIER
                         Has he hurt you?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (bravely)
                         His stinking breath caused my eyes 
                         to run, that's all.

               COULMIER kisses her on the forehead. She clutches him in a 
               hug, and dissolves into tears. COULMIER looks up to see THE 
               MARQUIS standing nearby. The TWO MEN lock eyes for an instant; 
               a flicker of jealousy passes between them.

                                     COULMIER
                         You mean to take us all down with 
                         you?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (with mock innocence)
                         Don't be absurd; it's only a play.

               COULMIER glances past THE MARQUIS to see ROYER-COLLARD rise 
               from his seat, and -- imperiously -- gather his hat and coat.

               Their eyes meet for an instant; ROYER-COLLARD shoots daggers.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (to the audience now, 
                              expansively)
                         It's only a play!

               The AUDIENCE is on its feet now; some cry "Bravo!" Others 
               hurl insults at the stage. Frantic, FRANVAL gestures to the 
               STAGE HANDS to bring the curtain down.

               EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE - MINUTES LATER

               The DOCTOR flings open the door of his carriage, where SIMONE 
               waits for him.

                                     COULMIER
                         It was fiction, of course.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (brusquely)
                         Of course.

                                     COULMIER
                         It was not inspired by circumstance.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         No. It most certainly was not.

               He boards, slamming the door shut with finality:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. 
                         Exploiting those drooling, pathetic 
                         cretins for financial gain --

                                     COULMIER
                         That's not our intent --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         -- a veritable freak show for tourists 
                         and curiosity seekers. Charenton is 
                         a sanatorium; she is not a circus. 
                         The theater is henceforth closed. As 
                         for your avowed friend -- playwright 
                         emeritus of the madhouse --

               COULMIER swallows; he knows what's coming.

                                     COULMIER
                         I'll do everything in my power --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (cutting him off 
                              abruptly)
                         Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced 
                         to report to the Ministry that the 
                         inmates are indeed running the asylum.

               The carriage screeches away, leaving Coulmier alone in the 
               night air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

               COULMIER bursts into the MARQUIS's quarters to find him 
               enjoying a late-night snack of fricandeau, a napkin tied 
               around his neck.

                                     COULMIER
                         I hope you're satisfied; he's shut 
                         down the theater.

               THE MARQUIS plucks the napkin from around his neck, and tosses 
               it haughtily onto his plate.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         He can't do that to me.

                                     COULMIER
                         How can one man possibly be so 
                         selfish?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         We held a mirror up to the Doctor, 
                         and -- apparently -- he didn't like 
                         what he saw.

               COULMIER charges to THE MARQUIS' desk and plucks a handfull 
               of quills from the ink stand.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (dropping his fork)
                         What the devil --

                                     COULMIER
                         If you won't be true to your word, 
                         then you've left me no choice.

               COULMIER grabs quills off the window-sill, the side-board 
               and the secretary. THE MARQUIS realizes COULMIER means 
               business; he lunges for the ink stand. It spills, sending 
               ink all over his desk.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         But I kept my promise! I didn't 
                         publish --

               COULMIER shoots a glare that says "Oh, please."

                                     COULMIER
                         Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn 
                         them back through good behavior --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You can't --! You mustn't --! I've 
                         all the demons of hell in my head; 
                         my only salvation is to vent them on 
                         paper --

                                     COULMIER
                         Try reading, for a change. The writer 
                         who produces more than he reads? The 
                         sure mark of an amateur.

               He snares a Bible off the shelf, tossing it to THE MARQUIS.

                                     COULMIER
                         Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, 
                         and more artfully written.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (spitting on its cover)
                         That monstrous God of yours? He strung 
                         up his very own son like a side of 
                         veal; I shudder to think what He'd 
                         do to me.

                                     COULMIER
                         You know what sacrilege is, don't 
                         you? The last refuge of the failed 
                         provocateur.

               COULMIER yanks open the desk drawer. In it, bottles of ink. 
               He starts to fill his pockets.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (truly frightened now)
                         I'll die of loneliness! I've no 
                         company but the characters I create --

                                     COULMIER
                         Whores and pederasts? You're better 
                         off without them.

               The MARQUIS abruptly switches gears; he has a new idea.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I have a proposition.

                                     COULMIER
                         You always do.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Madeleine. She's besotted with me; 
                         she'd do anything I ask. She could 
                         pay you a midnight visit --

                                     COULMIER
                         I don't know who you insult more; 
                         her or me.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         "Part the gates of heaven," as it 
                         were --

                                     COULMIER
                              (sharply)
                         That's enough.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You're tense, darling. You could use 
                         a long, slow screw.

                                     COULMIER
                         Good day, Marquis.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         THEN BUGGER ME!

               COULMIER exits, locking the door behind him.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         GOD DAMN YOU, ABBE! HAVE YOU NO TRUE 
                         SENSE OF MY CONDITION? OF ITS GRAVITY?
                         My writing is involuntary, like the 
                         beating of my heart! My constant 
                         erection! I can't help it!

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               From inside his cell, the MARQUIS pounds on the door.

                                     THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                         MAGGOT!

               COULMIER pauses. He hears the sliding of the peep-hole in 
               the door. He turns back to see the MARQUIS staring at him 
               through the tiny slit.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Where there's a will, there's a way. 
                         And a maniac is matchless for 
                         invention.

               The peephole slams shut.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - SOMETIME LATER

               VALCOUR admits the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN from the theater, THE 
               MARQUIS' WIFE, RENEE PELAGIE. The MARQUIS stares out his 
               cell window without acknowledging her.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I've done just as you bade me; I've 
                         paid a visit to the woodcarver. He 
                         laughed and called me a whore, but 
                         took my money just the same.

               She sets a satchel down on his desk, and unwraps it.

               Inside, two wooden prods, each about nine inches long. One 
               is ebony; the other rosewood.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I don't know which gives you greater 
                         pleasure; the objects themselves, or 
                         the humiliation I endure procuring 
                         them on your behalf.

               Next, she proffers a small box tied with a gold bow:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         And -- last but not least -- I've 
                         brought you aniseed drops and some 
                         chocolate pastilles.

               This gets his attention; he turns.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Did you now, Madame?

               His face softens, and he says with a suggestive lilt:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         They're filled with cream, yes? You 
                         know I shan't touch them, unless 
                         they're positively bursting -- 
                         erupting -- with cream.

               RENEE PELAGIE blushes happily, delighted that she's pleased 
               him. THE MARQUIS crosses to her; en route, he notices VALCOUR, 
               spying through the peephole. He snaps it shut.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         What else have you brought that I 
                         might nibble upon?

               He presses her against the wall, cupping her breast, and 
               kissing the tip of her nose. She offers faint protest:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Oh, Donatien... you mustn't...

               He licks the rim of her ear as he whispers:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Hm? Tell me. What other treats?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                              (helpless with giggles)
                         ....shame on you, truly...

               Suddenly -- savagely -- he slaps her; she reels, stunned.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm 
                         to sit here, gorging myself on useless 
                         trifles, sucking down your little 
                         sweetmeats, when what I truly need --
                         what I truly require -- are a few 
                         quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Forgive me, I beg you --

               He pulls the drawers from his desk, and hurls them to the 
               ground; they splinter.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't you see? I've been raped! Far 
                         more egregiously than any of my 
                         wretched characters --

               RENEE PELAGIE breaks away from him, and says in a voice 
               cracked with emotion:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         How was I to know, my darling?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         How was I to tell you? By writing a 
                         letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?

               RENEE PELAGIE backs herself into a corner, a safe distance 
               from her husband, and implores:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... 
                         your only ally... you must stop making 
                         such a monstrous spectacle of 
                         yourself.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (incredulous)
                         You've come to lecture me?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         To flaunt your deviance in public? 
                         Upon a stage?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         They've put you up to this, haven't 
                         they?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         You ought to court the Doctor's favor, 
                         not his contempt.

               THE MARQUIS tears open the box of candy, and pops one into 
               his mouth. He chews:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I ought to carve my name into his 
                         backside, and fill the wounds with 
                         salt --

               RENEE PELAGIE's eyes well; she dabs them with a handkerchief.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         You're here -- safe -- surrounded by 
                         brick and mortar; but my prison is 
                         far crueler. It has no walls.

               She starts speaking in a mad rush, tripping over her own 
               words, frantic to spill it all out before he cuts her off:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Everywhere I go, they point and 
                         whisper! At the opera, they hiss at 
                         me when I take my box. When I went 
                         to church... the priest refused to 
                         even hear my confession; he said I 
                         was already damned! Why must I suffer 
                         for your sins?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's the way of all martyrs, isn't 
                         it?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Give me back my anonymity, that's 
                         all I ask! Let me be invisible again!

               THE MARQUIS explodes now, his eyes spinning with rage.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Tell me; have you done anything to 
                         secure my release? NO! Have you 
                         petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought 
                         audience with the Emperor --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         He refuses to be seen in my company! 
                         He blanches at the mention of your 
                         name --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's a convenience, isn't it, having 
                         your husband locked away! You no 
                         longer have to hold your tongue, or 
                         hoist your skirts! Or crack your 
                         mouth, so I can put it to its one 
                         pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, 
                         NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, 
                         AREN'T YOU?

               RENEE PELAGIE starts to sob, convulsively. VALCOUR -- hearing 
               the commotion -- re-enters the cell.

                                     VALCOUR
                         What in the name a' God --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Take this cow away; I can't look at 
                         her.

               VALCOUR escorts a fragile RENEE PELAGIE from the room.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Perhaps you'll find a place for her 
                         in the West Wing, eh? AMONG THE 
                         HYSTERICS?

               As they lumber out, THE MARQUIS bellows after them:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         LOCK HER UP AS WELL, SO SHE KNOWS 
                         HOW IT FEELS! THE GORGON! THE SOW!

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

               In the rear of her carriage, RENEE PELAGIE. She's dried her 
               tears, and now bears a look of fierce resolve: a woman imbued 
               with a mission.

               INT. CHATEAU - THE ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

               CRAFTSMEN buzz about the place like flies, carrying gilded 
               mirrors, uncrating sculpture, fitting wall sconces, etc.

               GAILLON stands by at the door. ROYER-COLLARD AND MONSIEUR 
               PROUIX are at one end of the room, in rapt consultation.

               Swatches, marble samples, and blueprints litter their table.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         For a woman of humble origin, your 
                         wife certainly has refined tastes! 
                         When I suggest granite for the foyer, 
                         she's quick to counter with Peruvian 
                         marble. Peruvian marble! It costs a 
                         fortune to import!

               SIMONE wafts past on the balcony above; she glances down at 
               them, smiles. ROYER-COLLARD assumes the smile is meant for 
               him; he offers a tiny wave.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (beaming)
                         Whatever her heart desires, Monsieur 
                         Prouix.

               MONSIEUR PROUIX assumes the smile is his; he offer his own 
               toothsome grin.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         I'd like nothing better, sir, than 
                         to grant her every wish.
                              (sotto voce, to the 
                              DOCTOR)
                         But on the modest sum you've accorded 
                         me -- I'm an architect, not a magician --

               RENEE PELAGIE brushes past GAILLON with gale force:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I must see the Doctor at once. It's 
                         a matter of dire urgency...

               ROYER-COLLARD spies her instantly; their eyes lock.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It is customary to write first, and 
                         request an appointment --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Desperation has driven me past 
                         etiquette, all the way to frenzy.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         My schedule is not subject to the 
                         whims of lunatics.

               RENEE PELAGIE removes her hat, indicating her intention to 
               stay.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in 
                         a madhouse. Your every waking moment 
                         is governed by the insane.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (with a sigh)
                         I pray you: be succinct.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps 
                         you're not yet familiar with my 
                         husband, and his unusual case.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         With all due respect, Madame, all 
                         France is familiar with your husband.
                              (to MONSIEUR PROUIX)
                         Grant us a moment alone, won't you, 
                         Monsieur Prouix?

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         Happily, sir. Your servant, sir.

               He gestures for the CRAFTSMEN to follow him out. The room -- 
               a veritable hive of activity -- is now silent. DR. ROYER-
               COLLARD offers RENEE PELAGIE a seat.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Madame, please.

               RENEE sits.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I assume you've come to plead for 
                         clemency on your husband's behalf.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest 
                         hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed 
                         forever, and that when at last he 
                         perishes in the dank bowels of your 
                         institution, he be left as carrion 
                         for the rodents and the worms.

               The DOCTOR's somewhat taken aback:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I stand corrected, Madame.

               Now that she's alone in the DOCTOR's company, the full force 
               of RENEE PELAGIE's despair issues forth:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         If you can't cure him -- truly cure 
                         him -- then -- at least -- I beg you -- 
                         harness the beast that rages in his 
                         soul.

               The wheels in ROYER-COLLARD'S brain begin to turn; he idly 
               fingers a swatch of fabric.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It's not so easily done, Madame.

               He rises, circling RENEE PELAGIE.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You're aware, are you not, that it 
                         costs a great deal to house your 
                         husband at Charenton...

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I pay his stipend every month, far 
                         more dutifully than I should.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         That barely covers the cost of his 
                         room. There's nary a penny left over 
                         for appropriate treatments. Opiates 
                         to quell his temper. Restraints to 
                         chasten him when he misbehaves.

               RENEE PELAGIE can sense the direction of the conversation; 
               she blushes, and stares at her hands in her lap.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Perhaps if you were to buttress your 
                         entreaties with the means to oblige 
                         them...

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I am not a wealthy woman.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         But you've a pension, haven't you, 
                         from the sale of his books?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         It's tainted money, Doctor.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         What a beautiful thought, Marquise.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         What thought is that?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         That ill-gotten funds, borne of his 
                         degeneracy, might now effect his 
                         salvation.

               RENEE ponders the thought; it has a certain righteous 
               symmetry.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         If you're truly determined to step 
                         out of the shadow of your husband's 
                         celebrity --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Oh, but I am!

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         -- words alone are insufficient.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         It's beyond perversity. That honor 
                         should carry a price tag...

               The DOCTOR rises and crosses to her:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Imagine; old friends once again 
                         deigning to kiss your hand.
                              (kissing her hand, 
                              seductively)
                         "Why, Marquise. Enchanted to see 
                         you.

               Welcome back from your long, dark descent into the abyss of 
               infamy."

               RENEE's flustered; it's been a long time, and the DOCTOR 
               does have his charms.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Don't toy with me, Doctor.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Now is the time to secure your 
                         epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, 
                         Charenton's most revered 
                         philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.

               A torturous moment of indecision for RENEE PELAGIE.

               EXT. CHATEAU - MINUTES LATER

               The DOCTOR and RENEE PELAGIE step into the sun.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Rest assured that your generosity 
                         speeds your husband ever faster toward 
                         a cure.

               MONSIEUR PROUIX bolts up from the front steps of the CHATEAU. 
               ROYER-COLLARD whispers through his teeth:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         The Peruvian marble; without question.

               MONSIEUR PROUIX stares after the DOCTOR, baffled. The DOCTOR 
               escorts RENEE PELAGIE into her carriage. She gazes soulfully 
               into his eyes:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I am eternally in your debt.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And I in yours.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Doctor... Can I impart to you his 
                         cruelest trick?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Of course.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Once... long ago... in the folly of 
                         youth... he made me love him.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' BEDROOM - MEANWHILE

               THE MARQUIS lies against his pillow, his eyes flickering 
               malevolently in the candlelight. He hears the tinkling of 
               dinner china outside his door.

               INT. A CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               MADELEINE carries a dinner tray for THE MARQUIS. She reaches 
               his cell. He slides open his peep-hole. His voice has the 
               desperate rasp of a man in withdrawal:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Madeleine, my sweet... can you smuggle 
                         a paper and quill to me?

               MADELEINE shoves the tray under his door; she glances down 
               the hall to see VALCOUR stationed there.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I don't dare. The Doctor's got his 
                         eye on you, sharper than ever now.

               She gives him an apologetic look, and ambles on her way.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The MARQUIS plops his tray down on his desk. Wine from the 
               carafe sloshes out; a few drops land on his napkin. He stares 
               at the pattern of the burgundy drops against the white of 
               the linen. He traces a finger along the splotch.

               His face lights up; an idea. He grabs the carafe in one hand.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He steps into the room. In front of him, his bed. The sheets 
               are stretched against it immaculately: not so much as a 
               wrinkle. Inch after inch of white; a beautiful blank page.

               CLOSE UP: A ROAST CHICKEN

               The MARQUIS rips into the meat with his hands; he ferrets 
               out a bone. Next, he takes a tiny carving knife, and whittles 
               away at it, sharpening its point and hollowing its marrow. 
               Voila. A make-shift quill. He dips it into the carafe. Next, 
               he tries a few strokes on the pillow-case over his desk. It 
               makes a clean, bold line. His eyes fill with grateful tears, 
               and he hugs himself in the night air.

               EXT. THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - NIGHT

               One lamp burns in the darkness in the MARQUIS' chamber; the 
               sound of a quill scraping across linen.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         "Dr. Montalivet was -- politely put -- 
                         a diminutive man. When flaccid, his 
                         member was little more than a bobbin, 
                         and -- when enflamed -- it towered a 
                         mere four inches. To compensate, he 
                         strove to impress his lady love with 
                         a host of other endowments; fine-
                         wine, fresh game, and a house as 
                         large as his other fortunes were 
                         small..."

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               An enormous table separates ROYER-COLLARD from SIMONE.

               Even the dining room is in the midst of renovation; half the 
               walls are covered in silk damask; the other half are bare. 
               SIMONE reads from a thin book. ROYER-COLLARD has had more 
               than his share from the carafe of wine; he's feeling 
               "expansive" tonight.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         We've ceiling beams en route from 
                         Provence, and -- next week -- a 
                         muralist arrives from Paris, to paint 
                         a trompel'oeil in the ballroom.

               SIMONE doesn't look up from her reading.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Doesn't that please you?

                                     SIMONE
                              (unconvincingly)
                         Very much.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I'd prefer to have our brandy in the 
                         salon. There we can sit... side-by-
                         side... before the fire.

                                     SIMONE
                         I'd rather read, thank-you.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You prefer a book to your husband's 
                         company?

               SIMONE glances down at her hands, trembling in her lap. She 
               can't bring herself to answer.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Well, no wonder; I'm only flesh and 
                         blood. That's no match -- is it? -- 
                         for the printed page.

               He stands, sullen, and tosses his napkin onto his plate.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Good evening, then. I hope you enjoy 
                         your solitude.

               INT. CHATEAU - BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER

               The canopy around the bed is closed. Behind it, a comely 
               silhouette; SIMONE is awake, reading.

               NEW ANGLE: INSIDE THE CANOPIED BED - CONTINUOUS

               Dressed only in a night-shift, SIMONE holds a book in one 
               hand and a candle in the other. She hears footsteps; the 
               door opens. SIMONE blows out her candle. Through the curtain, 
               she sees the looming shadow of her husband, carrying a taper 
               of his own. ROYER-COLLARD parts the drapes.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I apologize if I took a severe tone.

               He plucks the book from her hands, and regards its title for 
               a moment: A Lady's Garden of Verse. He smiles, bemused.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You can't be blamed for your naivetè, 
                         not when it's chief among your charms.

               He climbs into bed next to her; she rolls on her side, facing 
               away from him. He presses himself hard against her back and 
               whispers hoarsely in her ear:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Perhaps the Sisters failed to instruct 
                         you in the ways of marriage; the 
                         nightly duty of a wife to her husband.

               He takes the hem of her night-shift in hand, and with a 
               wrenching rrrriiiippp starts to tear it up the rear.

               SIMONE -- terrified at what's to come -- seeks solace from 
               the room's only comfort: the porcelain MADONNA from the 
               Panthemont Convent sitting on her nightstand. The VIRGIN 
               exudes a holy light that illuminates SIMONE, even as she's 
               violated by her husband.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

               Sunlight falls in a crisscross pattern through the grate on 
               the MARQUIS' window. He snores, asleep at his desk. A KNOCK.

                                     MADELEINE (V.O.)
                         Your linens!

               His eyes snap open.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               MADELEINE pounds again, glancing nervously at the everpresent 
               VALCOUR.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Now or never!

               The trap opens, and sheets pour out. MADELEINE gathers them, 
               and notices something odd. Her face lights up with amazement. 
               She unfurls the top sheet. It's covered in script. She stuffs 
               it down in her basket, and scurries past VALCOUR.

               INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               MADELEINE sits by the fire. She unfolds THE MARQUIS' bedsheet 
               with loving care; like his pillowcase, its covered in words. 
               She starts to transcribe it. MADAME LECLERC sits near-by in 
               her rocking chair, knitting, her hands nimble in spite of 
               her blindness. She hears the "scratch, scratch" of a quill 
               tip across parchment.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         If you won't read it to your own 
                         Mama, then perhaps you ought not to 
                         be reading it at all.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's not your cup of tea, Mama.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         Come now, darling, give it a read.

               She clears her throat, and begins to read:

                                     MADELEINE
                         "Monsieur Bouloir was a man whose 
                         erotic tastes might discreetly be 
                         described as 'post-mortem.'"

               MADAME LECLERC can't help it; she smiles a naughty smile.

               Emboldened, MADELEINE starts to read in proud, clear tones:

                                     MADELEINE
                         "A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest 
                         conquest was a maid six decades his 
                         senior, deceased a dozen years."

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                              (interrupting)
                         Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too 
                         terrible!
                              (a pause, and then)
                         Well. Go on.

                                     MADELEINE
                         "The vigor with which he made love 
                         caused her bones to dislodge. Still, 
                         he granted her the highest compliment 
                         he accorded any woman..."

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                              (on tenterhooks)
                         Yes?

                                     MADELEINE
                         "Well worth the dig!"

               MOTHER and DAUGHTER shriek with delight and revulsion.

               ANGLE ON: BOUCHON'S CELL

               He -- too -- issues a low giggle, amused by the story, aroused 
               by its reader...

               EXT. THE PAVILION AT CHARENTON - DAWN

               MADELEINE slips the manuscript to the HORSEMAN.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You asked my name once; it's 
                         Madeleine.

                                     HORSEMAN
                         Sweet, then? Like the pastry?

               He grins and cracks the reins; his horse canters away.

               MADELEINE calls after him.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Haven't you a name yourself?

               He calls back, ever the flirt:

                                     HORSEMAN
                         Ride away with me someday, and perhaps 
                         I'll tell you.

               INT. THE LAUNDRY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

               MADAME LECLERC sinks the scribbled sheets into a steaming 
               vat of boiling water. She shoves it down with a large stirring 
               stick. The water turns red.

               EXT. CHARENTON - COURTYARD - LATER

               CHARLOTTE and MICHETTE are pulling the sodden sheets from 
               their baskets in order to hang them. They exchange a look; 
               something's askance. The sheets have an odd crimson hue.

               "Off-color" indeed.

               INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Steam rises thick as soup from the laundry vats. With a 
               flourish, ROYER-COLLARD unrolls a ruddy bedsheet for 
               MADELEINE's inspection. COULMIER stands by. MADAME LECLERC 
               creaks back and forth in her chair, anxiously.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Your mother may be blind as a bat, 
                         but you've a keen pair of eyes, 
                         haven't you?

               MADELEINE flares defensively on her mother's behalf.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Mama's blind on account of the lye 
                         in the laundry kettles; soaking sheets 
                         for lunatics cost the poor woman her 
                         sight.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         This could cost her far more --

                                     COULMIER
                              (intervening)
                         You'll get more from her with kindness 
                         than you will with force.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         What could cause a tincture like 
                         this?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'm only a laundress; not a detective.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                              (panicked)
                         Now's not the time to be cheeky, 
                         Maddy.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Perhaps your kettles are stained 
                         with rust. Maybe the lye's turned 
                         rancid. Or maybe... just maybe...

               He plucks a candle from the wall sconce, and holds it behind 
               the sheet; bleeding through the fabric, traces of cursive.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         ...these sheets once belonged to our 
                         friend, The Marquis.

                                     MADELEINE
                         We've over two hundred beds. They 
                         could've been anybody's.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Such a fine thread-count? Decorated 
                         in his very own script?

               ROYER-COLLARD turns to COULMIER and says decisively:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         She's lying. It shows in her face.

               COULMIER looks at MADELEINE, imploringly. Now is the time to 
               tell the truth. But MADELEINE -- though her cheeks are 
               blushing with guilt -- doesn't budge.

               INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' CELL

               Stacked in the hallway, THE MARQUIS' furnishings; his chaise 
               longue, his wardrobe, his bed. Paintings tilted against the 
               wall; sculptures sitting upside down. And trundling from his 
               cell, GUARDS. ONE carries drawers, newly pulled from chests. 
               ANOTHER, a candelabra and a crate of nicknacks. From inside, 
               we hear THE MARQUIS crying in protest:

                                     THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                         No! Don't you dare! Touch that, and 
                         I'll have your testicles on toast! 
                         MORONS! THIEVES! Help! That's 
                         fifteenth century, you goon! PUT 
                         THOSE IVORIES DOWN --

               LOUISON comes teetering forth with a wheelbarrow, stacked 
               high with books, and -- marching down the hall in supervisory 
               mode -- COULMIER.

                                     LOUISON
                         Almost done, sir.

                                     COULMIER
                         Remember -- anything -- ANYTHING he 
                         might fashion as a quill. His entire 
                         room, stripped bare.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               COULMIER bursts in; THE MARQUIS rails. COULMIER goes right 
               to work, casing the bedroom, orchestrating the further removal 
               of items from the room.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         So! The Doctor cracks the whip, and 
                         you dance!

               He gestures toward the barren space in the center of the 
               room, incredulous:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?

                                     COULMIER
                              (gesturing to GUERIN)
                         His rug.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         And my chaise -- am I being denied 
                         the privilege of sitting -- of 
                         plopping down my ass --

               GUERIN gathers the rug, and heads for the door. LOUISON 
               returns with the wheelbarrow, now empty.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; 
                         it costs more than you'll earn in 
                         your lifetime --

                                     COULMIER
                         Valcour. His chair.

               VALCOUR and LOUISON cart out the MARQUIS' arm-chair, orange 
               peels and all. COULMIER starts emptying books from the shelves 
               into the wheelbarrow; pages scatter and bindings break. The 
               MARQUIS decides to "pitch in" with rueful glee.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Fine! Take it! Take it all! Here --

               He tosses a candlestick into the wheelbarrow:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Careful, it's slippery, you've no 
                         idea where it's been. A box of Kama 
                         Sutra powder, ready to dust whomever 
                         you please...

               He plucks a small statue of the Virgin Mary from his shelf.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         And we mustn't forget Mary, sweet 
                         Mary, the Jewish Whore; God's little 
                         harlot!

               He hurls it into the wheelbarrow, too.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Virgin birth -- ha! An entire 
                         religion, built on an oxymoron!

                                     COULMIER
                         Orvolle. His wine.
                              (back to THE MARQUIS)
                         From now on, nothing but water at 
                         every meal --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         -- water! --

                                     COULMIER
                         -- and your meat shall be de-boned.

               The MARQUIS attempts to pirate away a pair of wine bottles, 
               but VALCOUR intercepts them.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?

                                     COULMIER
                         Because your writing continues, 
                         unchecked.

               COULMIER starts plucking THE MARQUIS' pornographic etchings 
               off the wall. Panicked now, THE MARQUIS rails:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! 
                         I ONLY RECORD IT!

                                     COULMIER
                         Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest 
                         nightmares! And to what end? Nothing 
                         but your own morbid gratification --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Morbid gratification? NO! I write 
                         what I've seen; the endless procession 
                         to the chopping block. We're all 
                         lined up at the guillotine, waiting 
                         for the crunch of the blade. Rivers 
                         of blood are flowing beneath our 
                         feet, Abbe.

               THE MARQUIS turns back to COULMIER with the eyes of a man 
               who has seen too much.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I've been to hell, young man. You've 
                         only read about it.

               COULMIER realizes -- for the first time -- the full depth of 
               THE MARQUIS's misanthropy. There's no point in arguing 
               further.

                                     COULMIER
                         I am sorry, Marquis. Truly.

               He turns and heads into the corridor. THE MARQUIS follows 
               him out the door.

               INT. THE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               THE MARQUIS pulls him up short.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Tell me, Priest. These chastity vows 
                         of yours. How strict are they?

               COULMIER pauses, stiffening. THE MARQUIS turns unctious:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Suppose you only put it in her mouth --

               Suddenly, COULMIER lunges at the MARQUIS, pinning him to the 
               wall by his neck. VALCOUR, ORVOLLE, GUERIN and LOUISON all 
               freeze, ready to pounce. PITOU and DAUPHIN have emerged from 
               their cells, curious about the clammer. CLEANTE watches from 
               his peephole.

               THE MARQUIS gives a sly grin; he's hit a nerve. COULMIER 
               lets THE MARQUIS go with a shove. His face stone, he heads 
               back down the long hall.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         PIOUS LITTLE WORM --

               ORVOLLE and VALCOUR grab him by each arm; he glares at 
               COULMIER; his eyes are wild.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         In conditions of adversity, the artist 
                         flourishes.

               They drag him back to his cell and slam the door.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               C.U. THE MARQUIS' REFLECTION

               Suddenly, it shatters, splintering like ice. THE MARQUIS has 
               slammed his own fist into a lone mirror. He picks up a shard 
               of glass and braces himself. With a grimace, he slashes his 
               finger. He winces, a sound lodged somewhere between pleasure 
               and pain. Next, he holds his finger over the ink well, and 
               squeezes. Blood starts to dribble -- one drop at a time -- 
               into the tiny bottle.

               LONG SHOT: THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - MORNING

               Fall at the asylum; the topiary has shed its leaves; tangled 
               branches claw at the air like giant, hungry birds.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               MADELEINE collects bedding on her routine run. She steps 
               over VALCOUR, who's snoring loudly outside THE MARQUIS' door. 
               The trap opens, and THE MARQUIS grabs her by the ankle.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (choking back sobs)
                         Psst. Madeleine. I beg you...

               MADELEINE looks down. On all ten of THE MARQUIS' fingertips, 
               bandages torn from cloth and soaked with bloodstains.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What have they done to you now?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Tortures so arcane, so medieval, 
                         even I haven't the words to describe 
                         them. If you've an ounce of pity in 
                         your heart, you'll throw caution 
                         aside, and unlock my door...

               MADELEINE glances at VALCOUR, who shifts in his sleep.

                                     MADELEINE
                         God help me; I don't dare.

               THE MARQUIS abruptly shifts his tone; no tears now.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't be a dunce, child. I've a 
                         surprise for you. Now open the 
                         frigging door.

               MADELEINE screws up her courage, and slips the key in the 
               lock. She twists the handle, leaving the door ajar.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               THE MARQUIS stands before MADELEINE, looking absolutely 
               resplendent, in a suit covered in words, all written in his 
               own blood. Quite a feat indeed. She gasps; her eyes fill 
               with tears.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (proudly)
                         My newest book begins at my right 
                         cuff, continues across my back, and 
                         completes itself at the base of my 
                         left shoe...

                                     MADELEINE
                         I don't believe it!

               He turns in a slow circle, like a fashion model on parade.

               A few tell-tale words are visible: "pikestaff," perhaps.

               Maybe "nipple." MADELEINE can't help it; she blurts a giggle. 
               THE MARQUIS joins her. Soon, they're both helpless with 
               laughter. Suddenly, THE MARQUIS remembers VALCOUR, just 
               outside the door. He presses a finger to his lips; MADELEINE 
               goes silent.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Take your leave, quickly, so you 
                         won't be blamed for my misbehavior.

               Suddenly -- impulsively -- she kisses him, hard, upon the 
               lips.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You can't be a proper writer without 
                         a touch of madness, can you?

               She slips out. THE MARQUIS stands for a moment, stunned by 
               her unexpected display of feeling.

               INT. THE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               MADELEINE almost runs into CHARLOTTE, whose been spying on 
               her in the hall. CHARLOTTE scowls:

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Traffic with the Devil, Maddy, and 
                         you'll pay the Devil's price.

               Just then, THE MARQUIS slips from his cell and scurries past, 
               a vision in his hand-tailored novel. CHARLOTTE's eyes bulge 
               with astonishment. MADELEINE grins. With a tremor in her 
               voice, CHARLOTTE cries out:

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Valcour! Valcour!

               MADELEINE breaks into a run, disappearing around the corner.

               INT. CHARENTON - DINING ROOM - DAY

               THE FACES OF THE LUNATICS, AGAPE WITH WONDER. One mouths a 
               few words, aloud. Another stomps his feet with reckless 
               enthusiasm.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               Dancing down the center of the longest table, THE MARQUIS.

               He skips over loaves of bread, and overturned goblets.

               PITOU is reading his waistcoat; BOUCHON paws at his leggings.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Feast your eyes!

               He thrusts out his ass:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Two chapters, one for each cheek! MY 
                         WRITING LIVES!

               Giddy from the loss of blood, THE MARQUIS collapses on the 
               table. THE LUNATICS pounce upon him to read every word; he 
               laughs with victorious delight.

                                     CLEANTE
                              (overlapping)
                         "Sister Mary Quesnet had the most 
                         dextrous vulva in all France --"

                         "-- so he set about removing her 
                         teeth --"

                                     BOUCHON
                              (overlapping)
                         "She'd never been with another woman, 
                         never mind her own mother --"

                         "-- twin orbs of delight -- with her 
                         puckered mouth, she swallowed him 
                         whole --"

                                     PITOU
                         "She wore her ass proudly --"

               ANGLE ON: THE DINING HALL DOORS, BANGING OPEN

               ROYER-COLLARD enters, VALCOUR, GAILLON and CHARLOTTE -- the 
               stool pigeon -- flank him on either side; he spies the MARQUIS 
               instantly.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (to VALCOUR)
                         Take this beast back to his cage.

               All the PATIENTS stare dumbly at the DOCTOR.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't tell me. You've come to read 
                         my trousers.

               On ROYER-COLLARD's face, the utmost contempt; the MARQUIS 
               grins, ear-to-ear.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't keep me in suspense. What'll 
                         it be? Fifty lashes? A night on the 
                         rack?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I won't sully my hands with him.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Nor should you. That's the first 
                         rule of politics, isn't it?
                              (a sly insinuation)
                         The man who orders the execution 
                         never drops the blade.

               INT. THE MARQUIS APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER

               CLOSE UP: COULMIER, whose face bears all the frustration of 
               a new parent, saddled with an incorrigible child.

                                     COULMIER
                         You're lucky it falls to me to punish 
                         you.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               COULMIER paces, to and fro. The MARQUIS, still dressed in 
               his "novel," sits on the floor.

                                     COULMIER
                         If it were up to the Doctor, you'd 
                         be flayed alive.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         A man after my own heart...

                                     COULMIER
                         What in God's name am I to do with 
                         you? The more I forbid, the more 
                         you're provoked!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I could be convinced to abandon my 
                         writing, quite voluntarily.

                                     COULMIER
                         What on earth would that require?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         A night spent with the partner of my 
                         choice.

                                     COULMIER
                         You expect me to pimp Madeleine?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I wasn't talking about Madeleine.

               The MARQUIS blows a kiss in COULMIER's direction; COULMIER 
               turns a fiery red.

                                     COULMIER
                         OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Coulmier, you animal!

                                     COULMIER
                         I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex 
                         without flirtation is merely rape!

                                     COULMIER
                         NOW STRIP.

               The MARQUIS begins to undress, hurriedly. First his tailcoat, 
               then his waistcoat.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         My shoes; they're naught but 
                         punctuation.

               COULMIER just glares. THE MARQUIS kicks them off, too. He 
               twists the amber ring off his finger.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         My jewels, family or otherwise?

               Once again, COULMIER refuses to be roped into THE MARQUIS' 
               little game. THE MARQUIS seizes the ring in his teeth, and 
               proffers COULMIER a gritted, ugly smile. COULMIER plucks the 
               ring out of his maw. THE MARQUIS now stands in nothing but 
               his stockings and trousers.

                                     COULMIER
                         Your breeches as well.

               THE MARQUIS unhooks the first button on his breeches, then 
               waits, expectantly, for COULMIER to do the rest.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You started this little game; you 
                         finish it. Or haven't you the courage?

               COULMIER falters; he wasn't expecting this.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (snorting derisively)
                         I thought not.

               He lets his trousers drop. In the dim shadows, the MARQUIS 
               is naked now, except for his hair. He sidles up, close, to 
               COULMIER, his breath in the priest's ear:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? 
                         Power over another man.

                                     COULMIER
                         Your wig. Remove your wig.

               The MARQUIS slides off his wig, and places it over his 
               privates, swinging it, like the tail of a horse. COULMIER 
               reaches out and grabs it away.

                                     COULMIER
                         You'll no longer spread your insidious 
                         gospel, where art's magnitude is the 
                         breadth of its depravity! FROM NOW 
                         ON, YOU WILL NOT EVEN WRITE YOUR OWN 
                         IGNOMINIOUS NAME!

               So much anger seethes between them, it's electric.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Are your convictions so fragile that 
                         mine cannot stand in opposition to 
                         them? Is your God so flimsy? So weak? 
                         For shame!

               The thinnest trace of a smile dances on COULMIER's lips; 
               he's won this round, and he knows it.

                                     COULMIER
                         Don't flatter yourself, Marquis. 
                         You're not the Anti-Christ. You're 
                         nothing but a malcontent who knows 
                         how to spell.

               With that, COULMIER exits with THE MARQUIS' clothing in his 
               arms. THE MARQUIS is left alone, naked and pathetic, in an 
               empty cell.

               INT. CORRIDOR - MEANWHILE

               ROYER-COLLARD storms down the hall toward MADELEINE's 
               quarters, with VALCOUR, GAILLON and CHARLOTTE on his heels.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I saw her with my own eyes. She put 
                         the key in the latch, just as proud 
                         as you please --

               EXT. CHARENTON - COURTYARD

               MADELEINE'S HEAD, FRAMED AGAINST THE SKY

               Reminiscent of the GUILLOTINE VICTIM in the film's opening 
               sequence. A SECOND HEAD looms into frame. Only -- instead of 
               belonging to an EXECUTIONER -- this one belongs to VALCOUR.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               VALCOUR ties MADELEINE's wrists to the posts of the well in 
               the center of the yard. With scissors, he slowly cuts the 
               laces up the back of her corset, exposing her back. Next, he 
               raises a steel-tipped martinet, poised to whip.

               MADELEINE's POV: She singles out faces: ROYER-COLLARD, who 
               watches imperiously from a window above, GAILLON at his side. 
               CHARLOTTE, who watches the proceedings with smug satisfaction. 
               MADAME LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. 
               MICHETTE, LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with 
               sympathy. And -- separated by a fence -- the LUNATICS -- 
               FRANVAL, PITOU, CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them.

               BOUCHON, a hideous scar on his cheek from the iron, all but 
               drools in anticipation.

               VALCOUR looks to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike; 
               coolly ROYER-COLLARD grants it. MADELEINE flinches in 
               anticipation of the blow. It comes down, hard.

               ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD

               As MADELEINE shudders in pain, the DOCTOR can't help himself; 
               he quivers -- ever so slightly -- with pleasure.

               An angry welt appears on MADELEINE's skin. Then another.

               She chokes back tears, enduring her punishment with dignity. 
               COULMIER bursts forth from the CROWD.

                                     COULMIER
                         FREE HER. NOW.

               VALCOUR stops short; he turns to ROYER-COLLARD. THE DOCTOR 
               stands, menacingly.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         He'll do no such thing.

                                     COULMIER
                         It's a weak man who tests his mettle 
                         on the backs of children --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         This child let loose the beast from 
                         its cage --

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine's not wicked. It's the 
                         Marquis who's corrupted her. That's 
                         not her fault; it's mine.

               COULMIER turns to VALCOUR, and whispers urgently:

                                     COULMIER
                         Your dagger. Give me your dagger.

               VALCOUR looks to the DOCTOR; which superior should he honor?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         LEAVE HER DULY STRUNG.

               COULMIER reaches out and slides the dagger from VALCOUR's 
               belt. He slices through the rope that binds MADELEINE; she 
               grabs him for support, and whispers urgently:

                                     MADELEINE
                         I was wrong to free him, but so are 
                         you -- for taking all his treasures -- 
                         his quills and his ink --

                                     COULMIER
                         Not now, or we're both done for.

               COULMIER turns back to ROYER-COLLARD and shouts:

                                     COULMIER
                         If only blood will appease you, then 
                         shed mine.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You'd suffer in her stead?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Abbe, no --

               COULMIER proffers both fists to VALCOUR.

                                     COULMIER
                         Go ahead. Bind them. Bind them.

               Reluctantly, VALCOUR ties Coulmier's hands together. Next, 
               he hikes them over the whipping post. He loosens COULMIER's 
               vestments, stripping them to the waist. Next, he raises his 
               martinet and turns to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         That won't be necessary.

               A sigh of relief from the CROWD. As VALCOUR frees him, 
               COULMIER rubs his wrists. ROYER-COLLARD stares at him with 
               steel eyes.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         If you want to martyr yourself, Abbe, 
                         do it for God. Not a chambermaid. 
                         Now put your clothes back on.

               COULMIER -- chastened -- turns a blazing red.

               INT. CHARENTON - INFIRMARY - LATER THAT DAY

               MADELEINE sits on the examining table, her bodice pulled 
               down around her waist. A severe-looking NUN prepares salve 
               for the lashes on her back. COULMIER sits behind a small 
               folding screen -- for modesty -- and talks to MADELEINE; it 
               takes considerable strength of will to keep from peeking at 
               her.

                                     COULMIER
                         Had I known your taste in novels, I 
                         never would've taught you to read.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Don't say that; reading's my 
                         salvation.

                                     COULMIER
                         But why must you indulge in his 
                         pornography?

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's a hard day's wages, slaving 
                         away for madmen. What I've seen in 
                         life, it takes a lot to hold my 
                         interest.

               The NUN presses a sponge against a particularly nasty gash;

                                     MADELEINE
                         Ow!

                                     COULMIER
                         But why heap such ghastly fantasies 
                         atop an already ghastly existence?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I put myself in his stories. I play 
                         the parts. Each strumpet, each 
                         murderess.

                                     COULMIER
                         Why not act the role of heroines 
                         instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, 
                         or St. Joan?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (simply:)
                         If I wasn't such a bad woman on the 
                         page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't 
                         be such a good woman in life.

               The NUN has finished dressing her wounds; MADELEINE stands.

               COULMIER'S POV: Through the partition in the screen, COULMIER 
               catches a glimpse of MADELEINE's body: the upturn of her 
               breasts, the soft slope of her back. He turns away, ashamed.

                                     COULMIER
                         This is no place for a child like 
                         you.

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - ATRIUM - LATER

               ROYER-COLLARD sits at a table, ledger before him, MONSIEUR 
               PROUIX on one side, GAILLON on the other. Lining up for 
               payment, various CRAFTSMEN: a BRICKLAYER, perhaps, A 
               CARPENTER, A GARDENER. The DOCTOR hands a small sheath of 
               bills to a particularly large STONE-MASON. When the STONE 
               MASON steps out of the frame, the DOCTOR is confronted by a 
               surprising sight: an incensed RENEE PELAGIE.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Good God, Marquise --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my 
                         husband's resources are all but 
                         exhausted. And to what end, I ask 
                         you?

               ROYER-COLLARD glances behind her; more MEN await payment.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         This is neither the time nor the 
                         place --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         If only you'd remained true to our 
                         contract! Opiates, for his nerves! 
                         Restraints! The man warrants a bed 
                         of nails --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (sotto voce)
                         I can say, with the utmost sincerity, 
                         that every franc you've given me has 
                         been put to sterling use.

               RENEE PELAGIE glances about the room, taking inventory of 
               its contents.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         That much is painfully clear.

               He stands and announces:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Gentleman, if you'll excuse us... 
                         only a moment... thank you, thank 
                         you...

               Amidst grumbles, GAILLON clears the room, closing the door 
               behind him. MONSIEUR PROUIX hovers behind it, listening.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You've no right to assault me in 
                         this fashion; I'll call for my 
                         footman. I'll have you removed --

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I 
                         be betrayed by every man I meet --

               SIMONE appears on the balcony above. She's overheard the 
               commotion, and senses something is amiss. The DOCTOR shifts 
               his gaze, staring up at her; RENEE PELAGIE notices that the 
               DOCTOR's attention has been diverted, and whirls around to 
               face SIMONE.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Ah! This must be the little Madame.

               SIMONE offers a faint, uncertain smile.

                                     SIMONE
                         How do you do?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         I must confess, I envy you.

                                     SIMONE
                         Envy me? But why?

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Your husband's name brings you honor, 
                         doesn't it? You can walk down the 
                         street without insult; without falling 
                         debris.

               RENEE PELAGIE's brow darkens with sinister pleasure; she 
               gestures at the riches in the room:

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         But suppose the whole world knew 
                         that all this splendor was the result 
                         of fraudulence? Of extortion?

               SIMONE stares at her husband, alarmed.

                                     SIMONE
                         Why has she come here?

               RENEE PELAGIE continues to address SIMONE, even as she fixes 
               her stare upon the DOCTOR.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         Public scorn carries a terrible sting. 
                         Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.

                                     RENEE PELAGIE
                         And why not? My fortune, siphoned 
                         away. My reputation, past repair. 
                         I've nothing left to lose.
                              (her eyes narrowing)
                         Silence my husband, or you'll come 
                         to know an infamy to rival his own.

               RENEE PELAGIE glances at SIMONE, who glances at her husband, 
               who glowers back at RENEE PELAGIE.

               EXT. A SEEDY BACKSTREET - PARIS

               A YOUNG WOMAN navigates the winding streets. In her elegant 
               attire -- notably the broad-brimmed hat which conceals her 
               face -- she's clearly out of place in this neighborhood.

               VENDORS in cramped shanties and make-shift stalls cry out to 
               THE WOMAN as she passes. Their VOICES fade in and out of one-
               another, like a demented chorus. The FIRST is a hairy, 
               toothless bag o' bones:

                                     FIRST VENDOR
                         Psst... Mademoiselle.... I've only a 
                         few doses of Spanish fly left...

               The WOMAN continues on her way, without glancing back. Her 
               cape billows behind her. The SECOND VENDOR is a scurvy little 
               jackal indeed.

                                     SECOND VENDOR
                         Cat-o'-nine-tails here, guaranteed 
                         to raise a welt...

               The THIRD -- a feisty little DWARF -- has nothing but herself 
               to sell. She coos to the WOMAN:

                                     THIRD VENDOR
                         Curious, aren't you? If I can pleasure 
                         me-self, I can pleasure you, too...

               At the end of the line, the WOMAN reaches the most decrepit 
               booth of all. She reaches to ring the tiny bell, and the 
               knocker falls off in her hand. She pounds on the door with 
               her fist instead. From WITHIN, scurrying sounds. The DOOR 
               cracks open a sliver, and an EYE peers out:

                                     VOICE
                              (with an insinuating 
                              lilt)
                         Yes?

               INT. PAWNBROKER'S - CONTINUOUS

               The PAWNBOKER's a sinister fellow with shifty eyes. His 
               CUSTOMER is none other than SIMONE, the DOCTOR's wife. She 
               glances about to ensure that the coast is clear.

                                     SIMONE
                              (covertly)
                         I'm in search of a book; perhaps you 
                         know it.

               She slips the PAWNBROKER a scrap of paper; he reads it, then 
               regards her warily.

                                     PAWNBROKER
                         I've only got one copy left; rescued 
                         it meself from the bonfire.

               SIMONE bats her eyes, hopefully. The PAWNBROKER sighs, reaches 
               under the counter, and pulls up a STRONG BOX, with a chain 
               yoking it to the floor. The PAWNBROKER reaches high on a 
               shelf for the hidden key.

                                     SIMONE
                         Please hurry. My husband locks the 
                         door at dusk.

               THE PAWNBROKER opens the lock, and lifts the lid; in the 
               box, Justine. SIMONE scrounges in her purse for the requisite 
               francs.

                                     PAWNBROKER
                         Sweet little thing like you shouldn't 
                         be reading such filth anyway.

                                     SIMONE
                         I grew up in a convent, sir. 
                         Everything I know in the world, I 
                         owe to books.

               And the book itself almost seems to speak...

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         "To the young maidens of the world..."

               INT. RC CHATEAU - BEDROOM - LATER

               SIMONE is at her vanity, with a letter-opener and a glue 
               pot. Gently, she loosens the cover off A Lady's Garden of 
               Verse.

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         "Wrest yourselves free from the 
                         tyranny of virtue, and taste without 
                         shame the pleasures of the flesh..."

               She slathers it with glue, and starts affixing it to her 
               newly-purchased copy of the Marquis de Sade.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         "Male power lies in the clench of a 
                         fist. But a woman's power lies 
                         elsewhere...

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

               ROYER-COLLARD snoozes in his nightcap. SIMONE has her head 
               deep in a book: A Lady's Garden of Verse.

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         "...in the velvet cavity betwixt her 
                         thighs..."

               The light from her oil lamp irritates THE DOCTOR; he opens 
               one eye.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         It's late, Simone, darling. Put your 
                         poems aside.

               SIMONE just licks her forefinger, and turns the page.

               INT. CHATEAU - DINING ROOM/ATRIUM - THE NEXT DAY

               PROUIX holds a swatch against the dining room wall for 
               SIMONE's approval: the Napoleonic crest, in royal blue

                                     PROUIX
                         Or -- if you prefer -- a Florentine 
                         tapestry?

               SIMONE glances at ROYER-COLLARD, who's preoccupied with the 
               FOREMAN in the atrium. She turns to PROUIX and smiles:

                                     SIMONE
                         Are you a literary man?

                                     PROUIX
                         Excuse me?

               From the folds of her skirt, SIMONE pulls her book.

                                     SIMONE
                         I so admire men with an appetite 
                         for... books.

               Intrigued, PROUIX takes the parcel. He opens the book and 
               peers under the false cover. His face turns bright red.

                                     PROUIX
                         Madame, how could you... have you 
                         actually read this volume?

                                     SIMONE
                         I've memorized it. Would you like me 
                         to recite?

               She giggles. PROUIX joins in, knowingly.

                                     PROUIX
                         There comes a time in a young lady's 
                         life when she has to cast book's 
                         aside, and learn from experience.

               SIMONE cocks her head at a coy angle:

                                     SIMONE
                              (a challenge:)
                         That, Monsieur, requires a teacher.

               INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

               COULMIER is paying a visit to MADELEINE and MADAME LECLERC.

               The OLD WOMAN sips tea; MADELEINE folds laundry.

                                     COULMIER
                         I've good news; I hope you'll agree.

               THE TWO WOMEN look to him, expectantly.

                                     COULMIER
                         I've found employment for you both 
                         with the Widow Rougemont in town.

               MADELEINE's alarmed; she doesn't want to leave Charenton.

               COULMIER does his best to keep the news upbeat:

                                     COULMIER
                         You'll have your own cottage on the 
                         grounds, and ten francs a month to 
                         use as you please.

               MADAME LECLERC nearly drops her teacup in delight.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         You're more than a priest; you're an 
                         angel! Ain't he, Maddy?

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's because of the Marquis, isn't 
                         it?

                                     COULMIER
                         In part, yes.

                                     MADELEINE
                              (quietly)
                         He's not the man who's cast a shadow 
                         here.

               COULMIER knows what she says is true, but can't admit it.

                                     COULMIER
                         The Doctor's a respected man, a friend 
                         of the court --

                                     MADELEINE
                         I haven't been to see the Marquis 
                         for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- 
                         I swear it. I won't speak to him, I 
                         won't even utter his name --

                                     COULMIER
                         Is that a promise you can truly keep?

               She can't answer. COULMIER glances at MADAME LECLERC; her 
               blindness gives him license to touch MADELEINE. He strokes 
               her cheek; she presses his hand tightly against her face.

                                     COULMIER
                         Charenton has changed; it's not safe 
                         for you here.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I've you to look after me, haven't 
                         I?

               EXT. ROYER-COLLARD'S RENOVATED CHATEAU

               The place looks immaculate down to the last detail.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         "Most Esteemed Dr. Royer-Collard. At 
                         long last, your Chateau is complete."

               CLOSE ON: THE WINDOW OF THE CHATEAU

               Through it, we see PROUIX, sitting in an open dressing gown 
               at a small cherry-wood secretary, proof-reading a note.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         "You'll find everything in its 
                         assigned place."

               INT. CHATEAU - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         "The chintz draperies, the English 
                         bell pulls, even the ivory door stops. 
                         Only one detail is missing..."

               He emits a series of staccato moans followed by a long sigh. 
               SIMONE rises from between the ARCHITECT's legs. Her camisole 
               is askew, and her face is aglow.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         "...your wife."

                                     SIMONE
                         Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's 
                         still a prison, even with Chinese 
                         silk and chandeliers.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         "By the time you read this, we'll be 
                         long gone; bound for England or points 
                         beyond..."

                                     SIMONE
                         Tell him -- if he uncovers our 
                         whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists 
                         with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat-
                         pin through my heart.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                              (genuinely touched)
                         You'd do that, rather than forsake 
                         our love?

                                     SIMONE
                         No. But tell him I would.

               PROUIX's face falls. SIMONE's leans over and whispers in his 
               ear to console him:

                                     SIMONE
                         Sign it quickly. Then you can ravish 
                         me again. On linens for which he so 
                         dearly paid.

               PROUIX rebound with puppy-dog eagerness; he traces her lips 
               with his forefinger.

                                     MONSIEUR PROUIX
                         Yes, on the satin twill... and then, 
                         I beg you, on the bear-skin rug in 
                         his study... and finally... as a 
                         crowning gesture... we'll leave 
                         puddles of love on the Peruvian 
                         marble!

               Slowly, he inserts his finger all the way into her mouth.

               SIMONE sucks on it happily, like an infant nursing a teat.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT. CHATEAU - LATER

               ROYER-COLLARD walks up the impressive steps to the front 
               door, GAILLON at his heels. Stuck there -- with a quill pen -- 
               a letter. He plucks it, glances back at GAILLON, then starts 
               to read. His iron jaw begins to quake.

               INT. CHATEAU - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

               He rushes through the grand foyer, up the magnificent 
               staircase.

               INT. CHATEAU - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Lying haphazardly in the center of the mattress: A Ladies' 
               Garden of Verse. ROYER-COLLARD makes a grab for it, only to 
               turn it over and discover its true contents. A primal cry 
               rises in ROYER-COLLARD's throat. Savagely he rips into the 
               pages with his bare hands, shredding them. THE MARQUIS' words 
               flutter down like snow. They fill the screen

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CHARENTON - DUNGEON

               CLOSE UP: THE MARQUIS' FACE, as the words trickle down, then 
               gradually disappear. His hair is sopping wet. His skin is a 
               pale blue, lined with purple veins. His teeth chatter, and 
               he sputters for air. A loud CRANK, and he disappears from 
               the frame with a start.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL THE MARQUIS, STRAPPED INTO THE CALMING 
               CHAIR IN THE DUNGEON

               GAILLON flips the lever. THE MARQUIS rises from the frigid 
               bath; his expression is one of distilled fury. He cries out -- 
               ferociously -- to an UNSEEN PRESENCE.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Show your face! I've a right to see 
                         my Inquisitor! You've an aptitude 
                         for torture I really quite admire -- 
                         we're cut from the same cloth, you 
                         and I --

               GAILLON gives another YANK, dunking THE MARQUIS again with a 
               loud SPLASH. When he rises, THE MARQUIS hisses at GAILLON:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         It thrills you, doesn't it, to hurt 
                         me thus? Look, you're solid as bone, 
                         you're straining your trousers --

               Another dunk, another splash. THE MARQUIS tries a new tact:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Stop, I beg you! I'll write dainty 
                         stories! Odes to Virtue! If even 
                         your God will forgive me, so should 
                         you --

               Dunk, splash. Now, THE MARQUIS roars:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         EACH ABUSE -- EACH TORMENT -- ONLY 
                         CALCIFIES MY RAGE! DON'T YOU SEE, 
                         YOU MORON? YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS FUCK! 
                         THE LONGER YOU CONTINUE YOUR 
                         VEXATIONS, THE DEEPER YOU ROOT MY 
                         PRINCIPLES IN MY HEART --

               ANGLE ON: THE DUNGEON DOOR

               We see the recipient of THE MARQUIS' spleen: peering through 
               the peephole, ROYER-COLLARD. In his eyes, some small measure 
               of vengeance, sated. He slips out of sight.

               INT. MADELEINE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               MADELEINE tosses and turns on the straw mattress she shares 
               with her mother; perspiration plasters her hair to her face. 
               Finally, she crawls out of bed, and slips out of the room.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Torches light the way as MADELEINE moves down the corridor.

               In the distance, we hear sounds previously unassociated with 
               Charenton: the clanking of chains and the wailing of inmates. 
               Perhaps GAILLON thunders down the hall, PITOU and DAUPHIN 
               under each arm. At last, MADELEINE reaches the ABBE's 
               quarters, and raps on his door.

               INT. COULMIER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

               COULMIER draws on his robe, and cracks the door. MADELEINE 
               slithers inside. He whispers:

                                     COULMIER
                         You shouldn't be calling on me, not 
                         at this hour; suppose the 
                         nightwatchman saw you, or the cook --

               COULMIER sticks his head out the door, glancing to and fro, 
               then closes it tightly; he can't disguise his pleasure at 
               seeing MADELEINE.

                                     MADELEINE
                              (cutting him off:)
                         Don't turn us out, Abbe.

                                     COULMIER
                         "Turn you out?"

               Somewhere, a patient wails in the night; another pounds his 
               head against stone. All Charenton rumbles with discontent.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's a sin against God for me to 
                         refuse your kindness. But my heart's 
                         held fast here...

                                     COULMIER
                         By whom? The Marquis?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (with a rueful little 
                              laugh)
                         Mother's not half so blind as you.

               COULMIER understands the magnitude of MADELEINE's confession; 
               he also knows -- all to well -- its futility:

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine, I... there are certain 
                         things... feelings... we must not 
                         voice.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Why not?

                                     COULMIER
                         They incite us to act. In ways we 
                         should not... cannot... a lesson the 
                         Marquis would do well to learn.

               MADELEINE's so full of feeling that she starts to cry.

               COULMIER reaches for her, and takes her in his arms.

                                     COULMIER
                         Don't. Shhh. You mustn't...

               He feels her body against his own. His resistance spent, 
               they kiss. Abruptly, he pulls back.

                                     COULMIER
                         Go back to your room. Quickly.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What? What've I done?

                                     COULMIER
                         Don't come back, not tonight, not 
                         again --

                                     MADELEINE
                         You'll hate me now, won't you?

               With no choice before him, he lies:

                                     COULMIER
                         I love you, Madeleine, as a 
                         parishioner -- as a child of God --

               COULMIER swings open the door. He summons all his willpower:

                                     COULMIER
                         My vows are mine and mine alone. So 
                         are my failings. Forgive me.

               Stung, MADELEINE stifles a sob. She gives COULMIER a final 
               hurt look and slips out the door. Alone now, COULMIER tries 
               to walk off his arousal, circling the room like a prisoner 
               in a cage. Impulsively, he goes to the door and opens it 
               again.

               INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COULMIER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

               He sees the figure of a GIRL, lurking in the shadows.

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine --

               Furtively, the GIRL steps forward; it's CHARLOTTE. She shoots 
               him an accusatory glare; COULMIER ducks back inside, his 
               heart pounding.

               INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR

               MADELEINE, still smarting from COULMIER's rejection, walks 
               down the gloomy, forbidding hall. She stops. Somewhere deep 
               within, MADELEINE makes a sudden, irrevocable decision. She 
               abruptly turns around, heading toward the MARQUIS.

               INT. COULMIER'S QUARTERS

               COULMIER kneels on the floor of his cell, his vestments 
               lowered around his waist. He prays. Clutched tightly in his 
               hand, a braided scourge.

                                     COULMIER
                         "...Lead us not into temptation..."

               He cracks the whip against his bare back; it leaves a wicked 
               stripe. His body flinches, but his voice doesn't waver.

                                     COULMIER
                         "...but deliver us from evil..."

               And another crack...

               INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' QUARTERS

               MADELEINE watches as VALCOUR turns a corner. Once the coast 
               is clear, she scrambles for her key.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

               She slips inside. She holds up her candle and -- crumpled in 
               the corner -- THE MARQUIS. He glances at her, a wounded 
               animal.

                                     MADELEINE
                         They've taken your clothes?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         They decreed me a savage, and now 
                         they have made me one.

               MADELEINE -- embarrassed -- abruptly turns away.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Surely you've seen a man naked.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's only been described to me. In 
                         your books.

               She rallies and turns to squint at him, seated in the gloom.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I must say, in your novels you stoke 
                         the most unrealistic expectations.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         You're far crueler than I, my sweet.

               MADELEINE tosses her shawl to him which he fastens like a 
               skirt around his waist.

                                     MADELEINE
                         The Abbe's sending me away. He fears 
                         for me here, what with the likes of 
                         you --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears 
                         for himself. He's like a man starving, 
                         and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork 
                         chop dolloped with heavy cream --

                                     MADELEINE
                         He's a man of God; he's true to his 
                         vows.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         First and foremost, he's a MAN. You 
                         remind him of that fact, and he 
                         resents you for it.

               MADELEINE's brow darkens; she knows it's true.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't you see, my sweet? In us, they 
                         see their own appetites, stripped 
                         bare. And so we are reviled; we are 
                         beaten, we are trounced, we are 
                         ridiculed, and we are silenced.
                              (past hopelessness)
                         What's to be done? It's the artist's 
                         lot.

               In MADELEINE, something stirs. An idea.

                                     MADELEINE
                         It needn't be; not if you've another 
                         story.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         How do you propose I write it? With 
                         dust, upon the air?

                                     MADELEINE
                         You could whisper it through the 
                         walls of your cell.

               MADELEINE sees THE MARQUIS perk, ever-so-slightly.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Yes; that's it! A final volley from 
                         us both!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Go on, child.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale 
                         to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll 
                         whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, 
                         who'll whisper it to his neighbor 
                         Franval --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (getting the idea)
                         -- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --

                                     MADELEINE
                         -- whose cell lies next to the linen 
                         cabinet! There, armed with a quill 
                         of my own, I'll commit it to paper!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (with real momentum 
                              now)
                         Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --

                                     MADELEINE
                              (practically squealing)
                         A tale more horrible than all the 
                         rest combined!

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Something to make the angels weep, 
                         and the Saints to gasp for air...

               He kisses her fingers, one by one.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Practice your handwriting, my lovely.
                         So you'll do my words justice.

               She nods, even as her eyes fill with happy tears.

               EXT. CHARENTON - COURTYARD - DAY

               A rumble of thunder from overhead; a storm is approaching.

               MADELEINE tugs a sheet off the line. Standing behind it, 
               COULMIER. MADELEINE -- startled -- gives a little cry.

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine --

               Angrily, tugs down the next sheet.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You don't fear the Marquis' sway on 
                         me. You fear your own.

               COULMIER reaches to take her by the arm:

                                     COULMIER
                         If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd 
                         like the chance to explain myself --

                                     MADELEINE
                              (nasty, but tinged 
                              with hurt:)
                         Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's 
                         watching.

               She grabs her basket by both handles and -- insolently -- 
               skirts COULMIER and heads inside. COULMIER starts to follow, 
               but in response she hurries her step.

               INT. EXT. THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - THAT NIGHT

               The sky cracks open with a deafening sound. Lightning cracks. 
               Rain begins to pelt the stone walls of Charenton.

               INT. THE LINEN PANTRY - A SHORT TIME LATER

               MADELEINE swings open the door and sets down her laundry 
               basket. She lights a small wall sconce, filling the room 
               with an orange glow. She closes the door behind her. Next, 
               she clears a space for herself on a small sewing table, 
               pushing aside a pin-cushion, bolts of thread, and a heavy 
               pair of scissors. She lifts a sheet off the top of the basket. 
               Under it, a stack of parchment, an inkwell, and a quill. She 
               removes each item, one-by-one. An EYEBALL watches her every 
               move.

               INT. BOUCHON'S CELL

               BOUCHON's hunched on the floor, peering through the old wooden 
               door. A belt hoists his sack-cloth trousers above his waist. 
               He's been dislodging bricks from the interior of his cell 
               wall to reveal the hidden door to the pantry.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

               The MARQUIS dislodges a small stone from the wall, and peers 
               into the neighboring cell.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Psst... Cleante! Are you there? ARE 
                         YOU THERE?

               INT. CLEANTE'S CELL

               CLEANTE is a study in nervous tics; his eyes blink, his ears 
               wiggle, and his mouth quivers.

                                     CLEANTE
                         Marquis? Is that you?

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         For fuck's sake, who else would it 
                         be? The witching hour's arrived; 
                         you've alerted the others, yes?

               INT. CLEANTE'S CELL

                                     CLEANTE
                         I'm no longer a man! I awoke to 
                         discover I'd turned into a sparrow!

               CLEANTE begins to warble. THE MARQUIS stares through the 
               wall at CLEANTE, eye-to-eye. His words are hypnotic:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd 
                         turned into a cat. If you don't do 
                         as I say, I'll sink my little fangs 
                         into your drumsticks, and suck the 
                         marrow straight out of your bones.

                                     CLEANTE
                              (trembling convulsively)
                         At your service, Count.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Now give the signal.

               CLEANTE lets loose with a piercing trill, to alert his 
               compatriots.

               INT. DAUPHIN'S CELL

               He sparks to the sound; at last, it's time!

               INT. FRANVAL'S CELL

               He looks up from his reading, candle in hand.

               INT. BOUCHON'S CELL

               Even he registers the whistle with a low grunt.

               INT. THE LINEN PANTRY

               MADELEINE whispers a tiny prayer, clutching the ink pot to 
               her bosom.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         And so we begin...

               With a certain improvisatory relish, THE MARQUIS begins to 
               spin his tale:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         "Our story concerns the prostitute 
                         Fanchon, whom Nature equipped with a 
                         tight and downy fissure between her 
                         thighs, and the most finely cleft 
                         ass ever moulded by the hand of 
                         God..."

               Through the chink, THE MARQUIS hears CLEANTE moaning, ever 
               so softly, masturbating to the tale. THE MARQUIS barks:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         CLEANTE!

               INT. CLEANTE'S CELL

               CLEANTE springs into action, rushing to the opposite side of 
               the room and perching on a chair. He whispers through a hole 
               by a beam in the ceiling:

                                     CLEANTE
                         "Fanchon was a prostitute with a 
                         tight and downy fissure between her 
                         thighs..."

               He starts to forget the phrase; THE MARQUIS hisses from across 
               the room:

                                     THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
                         ...the most finely cleft ass...

               INT. THE MARQUIS' CELL

               Under his breath, THE MARQUIS frets:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         My glorious prose, filtered through 
                         the minds of the insane?
                              (a sudden, consoling 
                              thought)
                         Who knows? They might improve it.

               INT. DAUPHIN'S CELL

               DAUPHIN crouches, listening, as CLEANTE transmits the words:

                                     CLEANTE (O.S.)
                         "...and the most finely cleft ass 
                         ever moulded by the hand of God!"

               He scurries across the room to relay the words to --

               INT. FRANVAL'S CELL

               -- Franval.

                                     DAUPHIN (O.S.)
                         "...a harlot, she was, name of 
                         Fanchon, with a downy fissure and a 
                         heavenly ass..."

               FRANVAL lopes over to the wall he shares with BOUCHON. He 
               removes a small sculptured crucifix, revealing a gap in the 
               stone.

                                     FRANVAL
                         Psst... Bouchon...

               INT. BOUCHON'S CELL

               BOUCHON' still busy peeping on MADELEINE, heedless of FRANVAL.

                                     FRANVAL (O.S.)
                         ...BOUCHON!

               Distracted, BOUCHON turns in the direction of FRANVAL's voice. 
               FRANVAL has to whisper loudly so the story carries:

                                     FRANVAL
                         "...'S about a harlot named Fanchon, 
                         with a downy fissure and a heavenly 
                         ass...."

               BOUCHON's lips curl in a grin.

                                     MADELEINE (O.S.)
                         Bouchon! You've something for me, 
                         haven't you?

               Almost shyly, BOUCHON ekes out the words:

               Smoke pours out from beneath DAUPHIN's cell, and into the 
               hall. VALCOUR -- several guards in tow -- races down the 
               corridor to investigate.

               MADELEINE hears their footsteps rushing past, and the rising

               transfixed by what she sees.

               MADELEINE'S POV: She glances to her right, in time to see 
               VALCOUR and his MEN tearing open DAUPHIN's door. Smoke pours 
               forth. The GUARDS are disoriented; it stings their eyes, and 
               fills their lungs. They stumble; VALCOUR coughs, then doubles 
               over. As he wretches, DAUPHIN clips the keys from his belt 
               and slips outside.

               MADELEINE senses that all hell is about to break loose; she 
               closes the door, and turns pack to retrieve her parchment 
               and tell-tale quill. She glances up to see -- with horror --  
               that BOUCHON's door has been dismantled. She stands and backs 
               away, until she bumps into a HULKING FIGURE. She turns. It's 
               BOUCHON, sewing scissors in hand. MADELEINE tries to calm

                         Remember your manners, Bouchon, like 
                         the Abbe says.

               But his leer tells the truth. She tries to dodge him, but --
               with a lunge -- he's upon her.

               They pick up the sing-song cry, screaming Madeleine's name

               COULMIER rushes down the hall and glances into MADELEINE's

               A burning pillow cascades down, trailing straw. As COULMIER

               CHAMBERMAID, rushing past.

               The CHAMBERMAID enters the infirmary; COULMIER races after

               who lurch toward him in the smokey haze like zombies. An 
               aging MADMEN with elephantiasis; a WITHERED OLD CRONE in a 
               stolen nun's habit with a hideous grin, her hands thrust 
               under her own skirts; ONE AILING MADMAN carries ANOTHER 
               through the murk; a demented pieta. In the background, 
               curtains blaze.

               COULMIER catches sight of the CHAMBERMAID. He makes a beeline 
               for her, grabs her by the arm, and swirls her around.

               It's not MADELEINE at all, but CHARLOTTE. COULMIER can't 
               help it; his face betrays dismay.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's her fault the Devil's unleashed 
                         himself upon us... it's her fault...

               COULMIER thrusts CHARLOTTE aside.

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine! Madeleine!

               From outside, a horrible scream. COULMIER's eyes fill with 
               alarm.

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE

               ROYER-COLLARD empties the last dregs from his wine bottle; a 
               pitiful little puddle in the bottom of his glass. Before 
               him, the asylum record books in grave disarray. GAILLON 
               lounges in a near-by chair. As the DIN of the RIOT grows 
               around them, they exchange a look; one that says "We knew 
               this would happen. How could it not?"

               EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE

               COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All 
               around him, WARDS -- like pagans -- are stripping off their 
               clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's 
               shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron.

               The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to see 
               MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed. It's MICHETTE, pinned 
               to the wall, set upon by a group of LASCIVIOUS WARDS, their 
               limbs all intertwined in an orgiastic frenzy.

               ONE BESTIAL MAN turns to look at COULMIER, his eyes wild, a 
               scrap of MICHETTE's clothing dripping from his mouth, like a 
               flap of flesh.

               COULMIER dives in to rescue her, but -- instead -- he's set 
               upon by more MISCREANTS, who tug at his robes and paw at his 
               hair, like creatures turning on their Master.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE

               From above, the insistent, demonic chanting of Madeleine's 
               name. GAILLON bursts from the office and makes for the stairs; 
               ROYER-COLLARD strides out after him, glancing imperiously 
               this way and that.

               INT. THE MARQUIS APARTMENT

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (a desperate howl)
                         MADELEINE!

               EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE

               Still fending off MADMEN, COULMIER bellows at the sky:

                                     COULMIER
                         MADELEINE!

               INT. OUTSIDE THE LINEN PANTRY

               As he passes, ROYER-COLLARD hears a scuffle from within.

               He pauses, and reaches for the knob. Just then, he hears 
               COULMIER and THE MARQUIS in the distance, each crying out 
               for MADELEINE. From the pantry, her voice:

                                     MADELEINE (O.S.)
                         Abbe? Is that you?... He means to 
                         kill me... save me as you have 
                         before... I beg you... I'm sorry for 
                         all that I said... please... oh, 
                         please...

               ROYER-COLLARD's face calcifies with hate. From inside, a 
               heart-piercing scream. He feels a surge of victory in his 
               chest, and lifts his hand from the knob.

               INT. THE GRAND STAIRCASE AT CHARENTON

               Cinders fall from above. Poised along the stair, ORVOLLE, 
               VALCOUR and GAILLON. They're passing pails of water upward 
               in an effort to quell the flames. ROYER-COLLARD joins the 
               line, passing a sloshing bucket from ORVOLLE to VALCOUR

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Quickly now! Altogether men, as one!

               ORVOLLE looks at him, surprised to see the aloof DOCTOR 
               suddenly so proactive.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         QUICKLY! Before it reaches the rafters 
                         on the upper floors --

               GAILLON gazes at his BOSS with glowing admiration. Coming 
               down the stairs -- disoriented in the smoke and the melee -- 
               MADAME LECLERC. With one hand, she clings to the railing. 
               With the other, she grasps at the air.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         Maddy! Where are you, child? Maddy!

               The LUNATIC QUARTET -- in their night drawers, their faces 
               blackened with ash -- trundle after her, playing a jaunty 
               tune.

               INT. OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

               COULMIER -- his cassock torn and soaked through, his face 
               scratched -- races down the stairs THE MARQUIS, meanwhile, 
               screams bloody murder from the peephole in his cell:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Let me out your morons! Let me loose!

               COULMIER catches his eye, and shoots an accusatory glare.

               "You've played a part in this, haven't you?" he seems to be 
               asking. THE MARQUIS turns silent, even stony, staring back 
               at COULMIER with lethal eyes. COULMIER moves on.

               INT. BOUCHON'S CELL

               COULMIER races through the room. He sees the dismantled door, 
               lifted off its hinges, lying sideways against the wall.

               INT. THE LINEN PANTRY

               Coulmier's eyes dart feverishly about; the linens are drenched 
               in blood. He glances down at his feet; he sees a few pieces 
               of parchment. He picks up a sheet. The last SENTENCE READS 
               "tear out her tongue" before trailing off the page. He 
               recognizes the curve of MADELEINE's script.

               His heart pounding, he moves toward the laundry room, 
               terrified of what he might find. Underfoot, a growing pool 
               of water.

               COULMIER'S POV: At the far end of the laundry room, BOUCHON, 
               dripping wet, his lower lip quivering like a naughy child, 
               recedes into the shadows. Meanwhile, MADAME LECLERC emerges 
               from the smoke, clutching her stirring stick like a pike for 
               protection. THE SOUND OF WATER SLOSHING. She turns, her face 
               full of dread.

               ANGLE ON: THE LAUNDRY VAT. Water cascades down the sides of 
               the vat. MADAME LECLERC climbs atop her pedestal, inserts 
               her stick into the brew, and begins to stir.

               COULMIER stands, dizzy, the room spinning around him in a 
               mad whirl that becomes...

               THE SWIRLING WATERS OF THE LAUNDRY VAT

               Rising to the surface like a phantom from the mist, MADELEINE. 
               Her skin is translucent blue. As her corpse rolls in the 
               water, we see that it is riddled with scissor gashes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHARENTON/PAVILION - THE NEXT DAY - DAWN

               The sun turns the horizon a feverish red. In the distance, a 
               cock crows. ORVOLLE and LOUISON nail wooden planks across 
               Charenton's windows; WORKMEN fortify the grounds with 
               barriers. The asylum stands, like an injured beast, too 
               obstinate -- and now, too cruel -- to die.

               ANGLE ON: THE PAVILION. The HORSEMAN waits, but there's no 
               one to greet him with a manuscript. A final, lingering look 
               and -- dejected -- he turns to leave. His horse rears up on 
               its hind legs in distress, then gallops away through the 
               morning mist.

               INT. BOUCHON'S CELL - THAT AFTERNOON

               The door swings open, and light illuminates BOUCHON. As soon 
               as he sees VALCOUR and GAILLON in the doorway, he scuttles 
               under his cot.

                                     VALCOUR
                         Now, now. Don't be shy. We've a nice 
                         surprise just waiting for you...

               BOUCHON peers out from beneath the bed.

                                     VALCOUR
                         That's a good boy.

               INT. THE DUNGEON - MINUTES LATER

               Sweat trickles in tiny rivulets down BOUCHON's forehead. We 
               hear the CREAK of HINGES; a metal cage snaps over his face.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               VALCOUR AND GAILLON, SOLDERING SHUT THE IRON DUMMY

               BOUCHON's eyes bulge as he's encased -- forever -- in a 
               sarcophagus made of steel.

               PULL BACK EVEN FURTHER TO:

               INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE - MORNING

               ROYER-COLLARD closes the door to the dungeon, and cracks his 
               knuckles with barely-controlled fury. COULMIER sits, his 
               head bowed.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Of course, we mustn't blame Bouchon; 
                         he's merely one of Nature's 
                         experiments, gone awry. No discipline. 
                         No conscience. No morality.

               He rears up from behind his desk:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         IN FACT, IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROVIDE 
                         THOSE THINGS ON HIS BEHALF. IS IT 
                         NOT?

               COULMIER raises his head. His eyes are red from crying, but 
               he's resolved not to lose his temper before the DOCTOR.

                                     COULMIER
                         As you say, Doctor.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         He was so impressed with the Marquis' 
                         tale that he chose to re-enact it, 
                         yes?

               Upon a certain chambermaid.

               COULMIER nods. ROYER-COLLARD blithely sticks the knife in 
               and gives it a turn.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind 
                         me of her name...

                                     COULMIER
                         I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say 
                         it.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         HER NAME, ABBE.

               COULMIER chokes back a sob and manages:

                                     COULMIER
                         Madeleine.

               THE DOCTOR tosses MADELEINE's bloody manuscript onto the 
               center of the desk, and lays into COULMIER savagely:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         So tell me: when you're called before 
                         God, how will you answer for 
                         Madeleine's death?

               INT. CORRIDOR - SHORT TIME LATER

               COULMIER blazes down the hall, torch in hand.

               INT. A PIT - CONTINUOUS

               COULMIER climbs down a spiral stair built along the parameters 
               of an enormous pit. In its center, a LUNATIC, crouched in a 
               feral pose. He wears a heavy iron collar with four long 
               chains, each strapped to a different wall in the room. He no 
               longer resembles a man; he looks like a beast, trapped in a 
               stone cage; it's THE MARQUIS. He peers into the gloom with 
               wolverine eyes.

                                     COULMIER
                         Murderer!

               THE MARQUIS blurts, defensively:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?

                                     COULMIER
                         Your words drove Bouchon to --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to 
                         do? Police my readers as you police 
                         me? Suppose one of your precious 
                         wards had attempted to walk on water 
                         and drowned? Would you condemn the 
                         Bible? I think not!

                                     COULMIER
                         An innocent child is dead.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                              (icily)
                         So many authors are denied the 
                         gratification of a concrete response 
                         to their work. I am blessed, am I 
                         not?

               This flagrant disregard for MADELEINE cuts through COULMIER.

                                     COULMIER
                         It's no secret that you loved her.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Oh, that's rich -- coming from her 
                         lapdog --

                                     COULMIER
                         I saw the longing in your eye --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         -- that was lust --

                                     COULMIER
                         -- the passion in your heart --

               THE MARQUIS grabs his own crotch:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Don't confuse one organ with another --

                                     COULMIER
                         I know, because I felt it myself --

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!

                                     COULMIER
                         AND DID YOU?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.

                                     COULMIER
                         You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; 
                         and yet with her, you cooed. You 
                         courted. You begged.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Go to hell!

                                     COULMIER
                         Why was it you never took her by 
                         force?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Who's to say I did not?

                                     COULMIER
                         Was it impotence?

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         NEVER!

                                     COULMIER
                         Then it must've been love --

               The MARQUIS chokes on COULMIER's last word.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN 
                         EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, 
                         SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --

                                     COULMIER
                              (triumphant)
                         We inspected the body, Marquis. She 
                         died a virgin.

               A stunned pause. The MARQUIS cracks -- a tiny cry at first, 
               which erupts into genuine sobbing. He sinks to his knees, 
               and claws the dirt with his hands. Finally, he whispers:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Give her a proper burial. In the 
                         churchyard, at my expense. Do not 
                         inter her sweet body in the same 
                         ground as the devils who inhabit 
                         this accursed place.

               Pause, and then:

                                     COULMIER
                         Your terrible secret, revealed. You're 
                         a man, after all.

               Suddenly -- savagely -- THE MARQUIS spits in his face.

               COULMIER wipes away the indignity. He stands, severe now.

                                     COULMIER
                         All that remains now is your 
                         punishment.

               THE MARQUIS extends his arm:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one 
                         of us will bleed?

                                     COULMIER
                         Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.

               For once, THE MARQUIS' balks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.OPERATING THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

               CLOSE UP: THE MARQUIS' LEFT HAND

               VALCOUR manacles it to an operating table.

               CLOSE UP: THE MARQUIS' RIGHT HAND

               VALCOUR cuffs it, too.

               Next, GAILLON splays the MARQUIS' feet, and clamps them in 
               irons. He buckles leather restraints around the MARQUIS' 
               torso. The MARQUIS cranes his head, and glances at the table 
               beside him. On it, primitive medical instruments, laid out 
               ominously in a row. A RAT scurries across them.

               GAILLON sharpens his blade on a stone. COULMIER watches.

                                     GAILLON
                         I've opium to numb the pain.

                                     COULMIER
                              (crisply:)
                         Our intention here is punitive. If 
                         we numb the pain, what's the point?

               The MARQUIS twists his neck to find the PRIEST:

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Abbe de Coulmier!

                                     COULMIER
                         I'm here.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Surely you'll grant me a final word.

                                     COULMIER
                              (terse)
                         Of course.

               The MARQUIS' eyes flash with malevolence.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         Would that I were so easily silenced.

               COULMIER wrenches his hand free. GAILLON raises his scalpel, 
               and looks to COULMIER for permission to begin.

               COULMIER nods.

               INT. OUTSIDE THE OPERATING THEATER

               From within, an animal cry. COULMIER walks down the corridor, 
               away from the grisly proceedings. On his face, a tiny flicker; 
               perhaps -- somewhere deep down in his soul -- he feels the 
               thrill of victory.

               INT. CHARENTON - ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE - A SHORT TIME LATER

               The DOCTOR is knee-deep in paperwork; COULMIER bursts into 
               the room. He slams a glass jar down on the DOCTOR's desk.

               Bobbling in alcohol, THE MARQUIS' tongue, so long and 
               serpentine it's wrapped around a dowel.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (surprised)
                         My, my. You have exceeded my 
                         expectations.

                                     COULMIER
                         And my own.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         How is the patient faring?

                                     COULMIER
                         Poorly.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         And you? It must've been an ordeal.

                                     COULMIER
                         I'm not the first man God has asked 
                         to shed blood in His name. I will 
                         not be the last.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Will you sleep soundly tonight?

                                     COULMIER
                              (faltering)
                         No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect 
                         to sleep again.

               INT. CHARENTON - CHAPEL - LATER

               On a slab in the center of the chapel lies MADELEINE, draped 
               in white silk. A CREAK as the door opens. COULMIER approaches 
               the body, and places a wreath of newly-cut flowers at 
               MADELEINE's head. He kneels to pray. In a voice choking with 
               emotion, he mumbles:

                                     COULMIER
                         "In nomine patris et filii et spiritu 
                         santu..."

               A bead of sweat trickles down COULMIER's face. He takes the 
               hem of MADELEINE's death shroud, and wipes the droplet away. 
               The shroud slides off MADELEINE's face. She lies dormant.

               Her skin is rosy, and her lips are slightly parted. Unable 
               to resist, COULMIER tugs the shroud off further, exposing 
               her shoulders. COULMIER marvels at her breasts, sloping 
               beneath the fabric. His heart pounds like a kettle drum.

               Impulsively, COULMIER pulls the shroud all the way off. 
               MADELEINE lies before him, flawless. There are no wounds, no 
               sign of the gore which accompanied her death.

               He gazes at her with an almost childlike wonder. Slowly, he 
               circles the body. Tentatively, he reaches out his finger to 
               touch her lips; to trace the white porcelain of her 
               collarbone; perhaps even graze his hand across her breast. 
               He hesitates, then he leans down to kiss her. It's an almost 
               chaste moment, but it stuns her awake.

               MADELEINE lives. COULMIER leaps back, alarmed. But MADELEINE 
               wraps her arms around his neck. She returns the kiss, 
               passionately.

               It's all the encouragement COULMIER needs; he crawls astride 
               her on the slab. Soon, he's running his hands in and out of 
               her rounded thighs, feeling each hollow, each moist crevice. 
               His touch grows from gentle to frantic as desire mounts.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Ah!

               Roughly, COULMIER parts her legs. She grabs his back, her 
               nails digging into his skin, as though she were hanging on 
               for dear life. With a guttural sound -- his Id, at last 
               unleashed -- COULMIER grimaces with pleasure and enters her.

               One savage thrust; then two. His eyes light on the crucifix 
               hanging across from him on the wall.

               ANGLE ON: THE CRUCIFIX. CHRIST's forehead is pierced through 
               with nettles, and blood flows in tiny rivers down his face. 
               He stares at COULMIER.

               ANGLE ON, COULMIER who shudders and glances down at the body 
               beneath him.

               COULMIER's POV: The lifeless corpse of MADELEINE, bearing 
               the wounds which killed her, desecrated, on the cold marble.

                                                             ABRUPT CUT TO:

               INT. COULMIER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

               COULMIER's eyes bolt open. He lurches upright, and tries to 
               stay the bile rising in his throat. A loud knocking at his 
               door.

                                     VALCOUR (O.S.)
                         Abbe! You'd best come quick.

               INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               VALCOUR and COULMIER move down the hall like bullets down 
               the barrel of a gun.

               INT. THE PIT - CONTINUOUS

               VALCOUR unlocks the wrought-iron gate, and they enter.

               Gasping for breath, VALCOUR covers his face with a 
               handkerchief. He raises his lantern. In the din -- flickering 
               orange -- words. Everywhere, words. On the ceiling. Written 
               on the floor. Etched on the walls. It's as if the TWO MEN 
               have stumbled into the tomb of Tutankhamen, with its glyphic 
               texts, or a Sanskrit monument covered in symbols.

                                     VALCOUR
                         He spat into his own filth. Made 
                         himself a kind of paint.

               COULMIER stares, awe-struck. He can't help but be impressed; 
               the effort is nothing less than Herculean.

                                     COULMIER
                         Dear God.

               COULMIER glances down to the pit's base. There, the MARQUIS 
               lies, his face pale and his breathing shallow. In spite of 
               his decrepitude, there's the look of triumph in his eyes. A 
               look which says, "I persevered."

               COULMIER rushes to him. He feels for his heart-beat; it's 
               faint. The MARQUIS tries to speak, but the soiled bandage 
               across his mouth prevents him. He can only murmur. COULMIER 
               calls up to VALCOUR.

                                     COULMIER
                         Free his mouth.

                                     VALCOUR
                         Mustn't do that, sir.

                                     COULMIER
                         I must grant him his last rites.

                                     VALCOUR
                         I don't take my orders from you; not 
                         anymore.

                                     COULMIER
                         You'd deny a dying man his salvation?

               Sullenly, VALCOUR tosses his knife down to the ground, then 
               recedes into darkness. COULMIER tenderly cradles the MARQUIS' 
               head in his lap, and mops his brow. He takes the knife and 
               delicately snips the bandage; it falls away.

               Slowly, painfully, the MARQUIS parts his lips. He coughs for 
               air. He tries to speak, but -- sans his tongue -- he can't 
               form words.

                                     COULMIER
                         Shhh... shhh...
                              (praying softly)
                         Dear Heavenly Father. Prove Your 
                         infinite mercy, and open Your gates 
                         to this man, no less Your child than 
                         any other.

               COULMIER kisses the MARQUIS' forehead. He makes a painful 
               admission for the first time:

                                     COULMIER
                         There is... in each of us... such 
                         beauty... and such abomination. No... 
                         man... is... exempt.

               The MARQUIS tries to smile. COULMIER smiles, too, his eyes 
               brimming with tears. The old affection between the two men 
               is evident, even now.

                                     COULMIER
                         Forgive him. Forgive us all.

               COULMIER places the small ivory crucifix of his rosary over 
               the MARQUIS's mouth.

                                     COULMIER
                         There now. Kiss the cross.

               A flicker of life in the MARQUIS's eyes; a remnant of his 
               old self. He opens his mouth savagely, and grabs the crucifix 
               in his teeth.

               COULMIER tries to wrest it out, but the MARQUIS clamps down 
               tighter with his teeth. The chain breaks; rosary beads go 
               streaming across his face, bouncing across the stone floor.

               With concerted effort -- almost gagging -- the MARQUIS 
               swallows. COULMIER watches, appalled. We see the shape of 
               the cross -- in relief -- as it inches down the MARQUIS' 
               gullet, beneath his skin. Finally -- with a last gulp -- the 
               crucifix goes down; The MARQUIS has ingested Christ.

               THE MARQUIS' pupils roll back into his lids. He stares at 
               COULMIER with a lifeless gaze. COULMIER finally breaks; he 
               lets loose with a primal cry:

                                     COULMIER
                         NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

               INT. DAUPHIN'S CELL - MEANWHILE

               DAUPHIN is shackled to the wall; his skull has been trephined, 
               and bears the trace of his own barbaric surgery.

               He hears the scream, echoing down the corridor. His face 
               contorts in empathetic pain.

               INT. PITOU'S CELL - MEANWHILE

               PITOU desperately covers his ears with his hands, but he 
               can't ward off the sound.

               INT. CLEANTE'S CELL - MEANWHILE

               CLEANTE -- sitting atop a crudely-fashioned perch -- hears 
               his Master, and lets loose with an urgent whistle.

               INT. THE DUNGEON - MEANWHILE

               BOUCHON peers out from his human cage.

               INT. THE MARQUIS' PIT

               COULMIER's whole face contorts in pain and rage; a man crying 
               deep from within the Belly of the Beast.

               FADE UP ON:

               THE BRIGHT, SHINING FACE OF THE NEW ABBE DE RICHARD He has 
               all the optimism -- the idealism -- that COULMIER once brought 
               to the halls of Charenton.

               SUBTITLE: ONE YEAR LATER

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

               INT. CHARENTON CORRIDOR - SOMETIME LATER

               ROYER-COLLARD greets ABBE DU MAUPAS, a youthful priest with 
               a face filled with optimism; he carries a small traveling 
               valise.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                         I'm pleased to have the new post, 
                         sir.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         I'm afraid that our endowment has 
                         shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're
                         the laughing stock of all France. 
                         But -- on a happier note --

               The DOCTOR smiles, and pats the ABBE jovially on the arm.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         -- the hospital is now in my sole 
                         command.

               ABBE DU MAUPAS all but runs to keep pace with the DOCTOR.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Here each man must work for his keep.

               ROYER-COLLARD swings open the gate to the work-room for the 
               ABBE DU MAUPAS.

               INT. CHARENTON ASYLUM WORK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The place is abuzz with the sound of industry; the bowels of 
               Charenton have been transformed into a veritable publishing 
               house.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         The Charenton Press, Abbe.

               ROYER-COLLARD waves toward a bank of printer's desks, where 
               a few PATIENTS -- FRANVAL among them -- are setting type, 
               their fingers blackened by printer's ink.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         The compulsive inmates set the type --

               He gestures toward sewing and binding tables, where DAUPHIN -- 
               among others -- bind the books, their aprons sticky with 
               glue.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         -- and the listless ones do the 
                         binding.

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                         It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients 
                         are so subdued; so docile.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         They've the satisfaction only a hard 
                         day's labor can provide.

               CLEANTE turns the handle on a giant press. PITOU plucks out 
               the pages -- one-by-one -- and hangs them on lines to dry.

               ABBE DU MAUPAS notices the title page: Opus Sadicum.

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                              (stunned)
                         I don't believe it. The Marquis de 
                         Sade? You're actually publishing his 
                         novels?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Ever since his unfortunate death, 
                         there's been a surge of interest in 
                         his work. I'll use the profits to 
                         restore Charenton to her former glory.

                                     A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh, Doctor.

               It's CHARLOTTE. No longer a common chambermaid, she looks 
               resplendent now in a dress befitting a young woman of station; 
               perhaps a future DOCTOR's bride.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You've a meeting with Herr Becker at 
                         four o'clock. He wants to publish a 
                         Swiss edition -- on gilded paper, 
                         bound in calfskin.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Thank-you, Charlotte.

               CHARLOTTE turns coquettish; she and the DOCTOR exchange a 
               telling smile; theirs is more than a professional alliance.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My pleasure. Truly.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Have a look at page seventy-four; 
                         I've turned the corner down...

               EXT. THE COURTYARD - MEANWHILE

               VALCOUR and GAILLON load crates of books onto wagons.

               MICHETTE -- idling by the well -- watches as the COACHMEN 
               depart, charging toward Paris and beyond.

               INT. CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

               ROYER-COLLARD escorts the young ABBE on a tour, passing 
               through the PATIENT's WARD.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Of course, everything's not as 
                         harmonious as it seems. I hope you've 
                         a strong constitution.

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                         My years tending the lepers at St. 
                         Emilion steeled me for life's 
                         grisliest offerings, Doctor.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         We've still a few lone incurables. 
                         Prone to violence, to perversion.

               They reach THE MARQUIS old cell; the peephole is open.

               ABBE DU MAUPAS steps forward to get a look at the MADMAN 
               inside; A FIGURE stands with his back to us. His hair is 
               long and unkept. The PATIENT speaks:

                                     VOICE
                         So you're my successor. Yes?

               Slowly, the speaker turns around. It's COULMIER. The ABBE --
               startled -- exchanges a look with ROYER-COLLARD; who is this 
               haunted figure?

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                         My successor?

               COULMIER barks a scabrous laugh, then abruptly changes his 
               tone. He presses himself against the door, and implores DU 
               MAUPAS:

                                     COULMIER
                         Listen to me, Abbe, and listen well.

               He casts a sidelong glance in ROYER-COLLARD's direction:

                                     COULMIER
                         I've stared into the face of evil...
                              (back to the ABBE:)
                         ...and I've lived to tell the tale. 
                         Now... for your own sake... let me 
                         write it down.

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Gibberish, my friend. He rants and 
                         he raves --

               COULMIER offers the DU MAUPAS a challenge, urging him to 
               defy ROYER-COLLARD:

                                     COULMIER
                         Prove you've an ounce of Christian 
                         charity... Bring me parchment...  
                         ink... and a quill.

               ABBE DU MAUPAS looks to the DOCTOR; what should he do?

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         You'll do no such thing. This patient 
                         poses a grave danger, to himself and 
                         to others.

               With lightning speed, COULMIER reaches through the peephole, 
               grabbing ROYER-COLLARD by the collar. He yanks him, hard, 
               against the door, strangling him with his own cravatte. The 
               DOCTOR's face starts turning purple.

               ABBE DU MAUPAS pauses for a moment; who should he honor?

               His employer, or the mad prophet in the cell? Impulsively he 
               acts, loosening COULMIER's grip on the DOCTOR. ROYER-COLLARD 
               gasps for air.

                                     ABBE DU MAUPAS
                         Are you all right, sir?

                                     COULMIER
                         Don't you see --

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                              (interrupting)
                         Don't you see, Abbe?

               A pause, and then contemptuously:

                                     ROYER-COLLARD
                         Some men are past redemption.

               ROYER-COLLARD straightens his collar and smooths back his 
               hair, and starts striding back down the hall. ABBE DU MAUPAS -- 
               queasy now -- follows, but he can't help glancing back at 
               COULMIER.

                                     COULMIER (O.S.)
                         A quill! A quill, goddamn you! A 
                         QUILL!

               INT. COULMIER'S CELL

               Discouraged, COULMIER slides down to the ground, defeated.

               He hardly notices when the trap opens, and a bundle of sheets 
               tumbles forth. Hoping against all hope, he folds the top 
               sheet back. There -- nestled in the fabric -- an ink well, 
               parchment, and a quill. He leaps to his feet, and slides 
               open the peephole. Staring back at him: the milky eyes of 
               MADAME LECLERC.

                                     MADAME LECLERC
                         Use it well; you owe her that.

               COULMIER's eyes fill with grateful tears.

               ANGLE ON: MADAME LECLERC, TEETERING DOWN THE HALL

               As she goes about her rounds, she sings THE MARQUIS' song, 
               Claire de la Lune.

               A QUILL PEN, FLICKERING ACROSS THE PAGE

               It seems to dance. The VOICE OF THE MARQUIS rises up from 
               the stone walls of Charenton:

                                     THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
                         "Beloved Reader... I leave you now 
                         with a tale penned by the Abbe de 
                         Coulmier, a man who found freedom in 
                         the unlikliest of places. At the 
                         bottom of an inkwell; on the tip of 
                         a quill."

               COULMIER scribbles away with all the fervor -- the mission -- 
               of a man frantic to impart his story to the world.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         "Be forewarned: its plot is 
                         bloodsoaked, its characters depraved 
                         and its themes unwholesome at best. 
                         But in order to know virtue, we must 
                         acquaint ourselves with vice. Only 
                         then can we know the full measure of 
                         man.

               Sunlight ignites COULMIER's face. A smile flickers across 
               his lips.

                                     THE MARQUIS
                         So come, I dare you... turn the 
                         page..."

               COULMIER begins to hum Claire de la Lune as we FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
