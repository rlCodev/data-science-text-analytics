                                     PRODUCTION DRAFT

                

               FADE IN:

               We descend upon Carpathian Ridge, a crescent-shaped cliff 
               that extrudes from the dense Virginia evergreens above a 
               deep rock canyon. The cliff marks the end of a dirt road 
               that winds down from above.

               Donnie Darko (sixteen) is asleep at the edge of the cliff. 
               With his bike collapsed next to him, he is shivering, curled 
               up on the foetal position.

               He slowly opens his eyes and looks around, disoriented by 
               the morning light. He then stands up, looking down into the 
               expansive rock canyon. After a moment of hesitation, he takes 
               his bike back up the hill.

               EXT. MIDDLESEX - MORNING (11 A.M.)

               Montage is choreographed to 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS.

               Donnie pedals down into the suburban village of Middlesex, 
               Virginia... passing by a large rock 'Middlesex' rock-pattern.

               Donnie pedals past two neighbourhood women who are 
               speedwalking with handweights. They smile at him.

               A Pontiac Trans-Am speeds by.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - DAY (SATURDAY 1 P.M.)

               Donnie turns the corner and heads towards the garage.

               We pan over to the Darko house... moving through the front 
               yard where Eddie Darko (forty-four) pulls the cord and his 
               gas-powered leaf-blower roars to life.

               Elizabeth Darko (nineteen) comes out the front door. She 
               approaches her dad from behind. Eddie turns and aims the 
               leaf-blower at her face... blasting her with air.

               EXT. DARKO DRIVEWAY - NEXT

               Donnie parks his bike and goes inside.

               EXT. DARKO BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

               We pull back from Samantha Darko (ten) as she is jumping on 
               a trampoline and pan over to Rose Darko (forty-two) as she 
               sits at a table reading a paperback copy of Stephen King's 
               "IT". She glances over to the kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

               Donnie walks into the kitchen. He then goes to the 
               refrigerator.

               Printed in magic marker on the refrigerator notepad is the 
               phrase:

                                     WHERE IS DONNIE?

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (5 P.M.)

               The opening theme of "Who's the Boss?" begins as we see Tony 
               Danza's blue van and the title card. We reveal Samantha, 
               sitting on the floor, singing softly to the theme song "Brand 
               New Life" performed by Larry Weiss.

               We pan over to Donnie, sitting in the La-Z Boy.

               INT. KITCHEN - EVENING (6 P.M.)

               The Darko family has convened for dinner. They eat silently 
               for several moments.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm voting for Dukakis.

                                     EDDIE
                         Perhaps when you have children of 
                         your own that need braces, and you 
                         can't afford them because half of 
                         your husband's paycheck goes to the 
                         federal government, you'll regret 
                         that decision.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (amused bitterness)
                         I'm not gonna squeeze one out until 
                         I'm thirty.

                                     DONNIE
                         Will you still be working at Yarn 
                         Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to 
                         raise children.

                                     ROSE
                         No, a year of partying is enough. 
                         She'll be going to Harvard this fall.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I haven't been accepted yet, mother.

                                     ROSE
                              (smiles)
                         If you think Michael Dukakis will 
                         provide for this country prior to 
                         the point when you decide to squeeze 
                         one out, then I think you're 
                         misinformed.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         When can I squeeze one out?

                                     DONNIE
                              (to his sister)
                         Not until like... eighth grade.

                                     ROSE
                              (to Donnie)
                         Excuse me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Donnie? You're a dick.

                                     DONNIE
                         Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, 
                         there. Maybe you should be the one 
                         in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay 
                         someone two hundred dollars an hour 
                         to listen to all of your thoughts... 
                         so we won't have to.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad 
                         why you stopped taking your 
                         medication.

               An awkward silence.

                                     ROSE
                              (surprised)
                         You've stopped taking your medication?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         When can I squeeze one out, Mom?

                                     DONNIE
                              (glaring at Elizabeth)
                         You're such a fuck-ass.

                                     ROSE
                         When did you stop taking your 
                         medication?

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (laughing)
                         Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

                                     ROSE
                         That's enough.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (to Donnie)
                         You can suck a fuck.

                                     DONNIE
                         Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how 
                         exactly does one suck a fuck?

                                     ROSE
                              (disgusted)
                         We will not have this kind of language 
                         at the dinner table.

               They are all silent for a moment.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         What's a fuck-ass?

               Despite his brave efforts to hold back laughter, Eddie Darko 
               lets out a slight guffaw.

               INT. ELIZABETH'S ROOM - EVENING (SATURDAY NIGHT, 9 P.M.)

               Elizabeth talks on the phone, getting ready for her Saturday 
               night. Rose knocks and then enters.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (into the phone)
                         No. I took a year off to be with 
                         you.
                              (beat)
                         Of course I care. Don't get angry.
                              (covering the phone)
                         What?

                                     ROSE
                         How did you know --

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (cutting her off)
                         I didn't realise it was such a big 
                         deal.

                                     ROSE
                         It is a big deal.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I caught him flushing pills down the 
                         toilet. He knows you check the 
                         container.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NEXT

               Donnie lies on his bed, reading "Collected Short Stories" by 
               Graham Greene. His room is an organised wreck.

               Rose enters and begins to pick things up of the floor.

                                     DONNIE
                         Get out of my room.

               Rose bitterly turns to leave, but stops at the door.

                                     ROSE
                         I wish I knew where you went at night.
                              (beat)
                         Did you toilet paper the Johnson's 
                         house?

                                     DONNIE
                              (still reading)
                         I stopped rolling houses in the sixth 
                         grade, Mom.
                              (beat)
                         Get out of my room.

                                     ROSE
                         You know... it would be nice to look 
                         at you some time... and see my son. 
                         I don't recognise this person today.

                                     DONNIE
                         Then why don't you start taking the 
                         goddamn pills?

               Donnie leans over and turns off his lamp. Rose turns and 
               leaves her son alone in the dark, closing the door behind 
               her.

                                     DONNIE
                         Bitch.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NEXT

               Rose stops in her tracks, hearing this. She then walks into 
               her bedroom and closes the door.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT

               Rose goes into bed with Eddie, who is reading a hardback 
               copy of Stephen King's "The Tommyknockers".

                                     ROSE
                         Our son just called me a bitch.

                                     EDDIE
                              (beat)
                         You're not a bitch.

               INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NEXT

               Donnie removes his pills from the medicine cabinet. We see 
               insert that reads: L. THURMAN M.D.

               He looks at the bottle for a moment, and then takes three 
               pills and swallows them... staring at his reflection in the 
               mirror.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (12 A.M.)

               Eddie sits up in bed, unable to sleep.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               The TV pops on. Eddie drops into the La-Z Boy.

               They are replaying a Bush/Dukakis debate. Eddie laughs.

               INT. FOYER - NEXT

               We pull back and pan over to a grandfather clock... as the 
               hand reaches midnight.

               TITLE CARD:

                                      OCTOBER 2 1988

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, 1 A.M.)

                                     VOICE
                              (whisper)
                         Wake... up... Donnie.

               Donnie jerks upright in his bed, awakened from a bad dream. 
               He looks over at his alarm clock: 12:50 a.m. His expression 
               is distant... confused.

               INT. FOYER - NEXT

               Donnie walks downstairs.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               Donnie stares at Eddie, asleep in the La-Z Boy.

               INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

               Donnie walks into the kitchen, removes the magic marker from 
               the refrigerator message board.

               INT. FOYER - NEXT

               Donnie walks to the front and exits the house.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NEXT

               Donnie walks down the front walk to the street.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NEXT

               Donnie walks down the street.

               EXT. SEVENTH HOLE - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

               Donnie arrives next to the pin and stares off into the 
               distance.

                                     VOICE
                         Helluva night for a walk... huh, 
                         Donnie?

               Donnie stares off into the distance.

                                     VOICE
                         Tonight is very special, Donnie.

                                     DONNIE
                         What?

                                     VOICE
                         I've been watching you.
                              (beat)
                         Do you believe in God, Donnie?

               Donnie doesn't answer. He holds his stomach, taking deep 
               breaths.

                                     VOICE
                         God loves his children, Donnie. God 
                         loves you.

               There... standing on the seventh hole is a six-foot-tall 
               figure dressed in a grotesque bunny suit.

               Donnie stares at the Bunny nervously as a wave of nausea 
               overcomes him.

                                     BUNNY
                         My name is Frank.
                              (beat)
                         I want you to follow me.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why?

                                     FRANK
                         I'm here to save you.
                              (beat)
                         The world is coming to an end, Donnie.

               Donnie doesn't answer.

                                     FRANK
                         Look up in the sky, Donnie.

               He looks up into the black night.

                                     FRANK
                         28 days... 6 hours... 42 minutes... 
                         12 seconds. That is when the world 
                         will end.

               Donnie looks back at Frank. His expression is a vacant expanse 
               of confusion.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               Elizabeth comes through the front door, leans back against 
               it, closes her eyes.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

               Eddie Darko sleeps reclined in the La-Z Boy. The final notes 
               of the Channel 12 National Anthem fade away to static.

               From above... a thunderous crash. Plaster rains from the 
               ceiling ...Books fly off the bookshelf as the entire wall-
               mount collapses to the floor.

               Eddie jerks awake.

               INT. FOYER - NEXT

               Elizabeth falls back in horror as plaster rains down from 
               around the chandelier... debris falling in the dining-room 
               doorway.

               EXT. SEVENTH HOLE - MORNING (SUNDAY MORNING, 10 A.M.)

               Donnie is curled up, asleep on the green. A golf ball lands 
               on the green and rolls within inches of his head.

               A golf cart filled with four older men arrives. Dr. Fisher 
               (forty-five) gets out first.

                                     DR. FISHER
                         Donnie Darko?
                              (beat)
                         Son? What's going on here?

               Jim Cunningham (forty), the man riding shotgun, gets out of 
               the cart and walks over.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Who is it, Don?

                                     DR. FISHER
                         Eddie Darko's kid.

               Donnie gets up and brushes himself off. On his arm he sees 
               something written in black magic marker.

               Numbers... 28:06:42:12.

               Donnie stares at the numbers on his arm, confused.

                                     DR. FISHER
                              (to Jim, kissing his 
                              ass)
                         Sorry about this, Jim, just a... a 
                         kid from the neighbourhood.
                              (back to Donnie)
                         So let's stay off the greens at night, 
                         OK?

               Jim Cunningham stares at Donnie with a friendly grin.

                                     DONNIE
                         Sorry, Dr. Fisher. It won't happen 
                         again.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET / DARKO HOUSE - MORNING (11 A.M.)

               Donnie walks down the street towards his house.

               A fire engine. Two police cars. A news van... All parked in 
               front of his house.

               There are dozens of neighbours in the street surrounding a 
               barricade. Donnie moves through the crowd where a Police 
               Officer is standing.

                                     DONNIE
                         Hey, I live here!

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Are you... Donnie Darko?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah!

               The Officer lets him through.

               Near the cul-de-sac there is a large caterpillar crane lifting 
               something from inside the house. There are firemen roaming 
               around. Two Police Officers are speaking with Eddie and Rose.  
               Donnie looks over at the house.

               A crane lifts a gigantic jet engine over from the house 
               towards a large flatbed truck. Firemen kick pieces of wood 
               and shingle from the roof.

               He turns and sees his entire family standing there. Eddie is 
               holding Samantha.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         It fell on your room.

               EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - LATER ON

               Two men in suits approach from a black sedan. A police officer 
               directs them to Rose. One of the men removes a badge from 
               his pocket and holds it up for Rose to see.

                                     MAN
                         Mrs. Darko, my name is Bob Garland 
                         and this is David Coleman. We're 
                         with the FAA. If you don't mind, 
                         we'd like to speak with you and your 
                         husband privately.

               Elizabeth looks over at Donnie with a grin.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (whispering)
                         They don't know where it came from.

               Donnie looks over in awe as the mammoth engine is now strapped 
               to the flatbed truck. A man in a silver firesuit sprays the 
               engine down with water.

               EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - MOMENTS LATER

               Eddie is signing some documents in front of Garland at a 
               table that has been set up. Another FAA guy is there.

                                     FAA MAN
                              (pointing to the 
                              document)
                         And then here as well.

               Eddie signs off, and Garland takes the documents.

                                     GARLAND
                         We've arranged for you to stay at a 
                         hotel, get some sleep. We'll take 
                         care of things here.

               Eddie picks Samantha up into his arms. He stands with Rose 
               and Elizabeth... turning towards Donnie... who seems lost in 
               a trance.

                                     EDDIE
                         Come on, Donnie... we're going to a 
                         hotel.

               INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 614 - SUNDOWN (SUNDAY NIGHT, 5:30 
               P.M.)

               Donnie lies in bed, watching television. Elizabeth is spread 
               out on the other bed. Samantha sits on the edge of Elizabeth's 
               bed, holding a stuffed unicorn named Ariel.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         If it fell from a plane, then what 
                         happened to the plane?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         They don't know, Samantha.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Is there any way that we can make 
                         money from this? Couldn't we get on 
                         television if we sue the airline?

               INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 615 - NEXT

               Rose and Eddie lie awake in the dark.

                                     ROSE
                         So let me get this straight. No 
                         airline will claim ownership of the 
                         engine. So we have to wait for the 
                         FAA to decide who fixes my roof.
                              (beat)
                         Fuck that. We're taking the money 
                         out of savings.

                                     EDDIE
                              (quoting Rod Serling)
                         You are entering a new dimension of 
                         sight and sound...

               Rose begins to laugh.

               INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 614 - NEXT

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? 
                         He stinks.

                                     DONNIE
                         When you fall asleep tonight, I'm 
                         gonna fart in your face.

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (walking to the door)
                         I'm telling Mom.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Samantha, don't go over there.

               INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 615 - LATER THAT NIGHT

                                     EDDIE
                         Frankie Feedler.

                                     ROSE
                         What?

                                     EDDIE
                         Frankie Feedler. You remember him 
                         from high school?

                                     ROSE
                              (long beat)
                         He was a year ahead of us?

                                     EDDIE
                         He died, remember? On the way to the 
                         prom.
                              (beat)
                         He was doomed.

               Rose lies there silently.

                                     EDDIE
                         Jesus Christ. They could have said 
                         the same thing about Donnie. Our 
                         Donnie.
                              (beat)
                         But he dodged it. He dodged his 
                         bullet, Rose.

               Rose rolls over to embrace him.

                                     EDDIE
                         That's my boy.

               Moments later, the door to the adjoining room opens. It is 
               Samantha.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Mom, Donnie said he's gonna fart in 
                         my face.

                                      OCTOBER 3 1988

               EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING (MONDAY MORNING, 7 A.M.)

               Rose drops Donnie and Samantha off at the corner.

                                     ROSE
                         Ms. Farmer will pick you up from 
                         recital. Bye, now.

               She pulls of in the Taurus.

               Already waiting at the bus stop is Joanie James (eleven). 
               Also Cherita Chen (fifteen).

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Hi, Cherita.

                                     CHERITA
                         Chut up.

               Also there are Donnie's two best friends, Sean Smith (sixteen) 
               and Ronald Fisher (fifteen)

                                     RONALD
                              (raising his hands in 
                              victory)
                         DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're 
                         famous! I called you, like, a jillion 
                         times last night!

                                     DONNIE
                         We went to a hotel.

                                     RONALD
                         My dad said he found you on the golf 
                         course. Are you sleepwalking again?

                                     DONNIE
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     SEAN
                         Now that you're famous, you gotta 
                         have a smoke.

               Sean hands Donnie a Marlboro Red and he takes it, looking 
               over at Samantha and Joanie.

                                     DONNIE
                         What happens if you tell Mom and Dad 
                         about this, Samantha?

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You'll put Ariel in the garbage 
                         disposal.

                                     JOANIE
                         So... grody.

               Sean, Ronald and Donnie light up. Ronald is the most amateur-
               looking.

                                     SEAN
                         Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?

                                     CHERITA
                         Chut up.

                                     RONALD
                              (mimicking)
                         Chut up!

                                     SEAN
                         Go back to China, bitch!

                                     DONNIE
                         Leave her alone, man.

               Cherita looks over at Donnie... her quiet devastation poorly 
               hidden.

               EXT. / INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - MORNING (8 A.M.)

               The following montage is three long Steadicam shots in the 
               main school hallway and courtyard.

               We follow Donnie and his friends as they pour out of the 
               back of the emergency exit of the school bus to 'Head Over 
               Heels' by Tears for Fears.

               We pick up teachers Karen Pomeroy (twenty-seven) and Dr. 
               Kenneth Monnitoff (thirty) and Kitty Farmer (forty-two), 
               with Jim Cunningham, as they make their way through the 
               hallways.

               Swarms of girls surround Donnie as he makes his way to his 
               locker. There is a huge smile on his face.

               We reveal Gretchen Ross (fifteen)... we see Principal Cole 
               (thirty-eight) and then Samantha's dance team (Sparkle Motion) 
               practising their routine in the courtyard.

               We follow Ms. Pomeroy into English class... then time-lapse 
               dissolve through the doorway...

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY (8:30 A.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy has been reading from "The Destructors" by Graham 
               Greene.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         "There would be headlines in the 
                         papers. Even the grown-up gangs who 
                         ran the betting at the all-in 
                         wrestling and the barrow-boys would 
                         hear with respect how Old Misery's 
                         house had been destroyed. It was as 
                         though this plan had been with him 
                         all his life, pondered through the 
                         seasons, now in his fifteenth year 
                         crystallised with the pain of 
                         puberty."

               Donnie sits in the front.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         What is Graham Greene trying to 
                         communicate in this passage? Why do 
                         the children break into Old Misery's 
                         house?

               Joanie James raises her hand.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Joanie.

                                     JOANIE
                         They wanted to rob him.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Joanie, if you had actually read the 
                         short story... which, at a whopping 
                         thirteen pages must have kept you up 
                         all night, you would know that the 
                         children find a great deal of money 
                         hidden in a mattress. But they burn 
                         it.

               The class gives an "Awwww." Joanie blushes.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your 
                         recent brush with mass destruction, 
                         you can give us your opinion?

                                     DONNIE
                         Well... they say it right when they 
                         are ripping the place to shreds. 
                         When they flood the house. That 
                         like... destruction is a form of 
                         creation. So the fact that they burn 
                         the money is... ironic. They just 
                         want to see what happens when they 
                         tear the world apart.
                              (beat)
                         They want to change things.

               Gretchen Ross stands at the doorway to the classroom.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         May we help you?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         I just registered, and I think they 
                         put me in the wrong English class.

               Ms. Pomeroy studies her.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         You look like you belong here.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Umm, where do I sit?

               Ms. Pomeroy thinks for a moment. There are several empty 
               chairs.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Sit next to the boy you think is the 
                         cutest. Girls, get up.

               The whole class begins to freak out. The girls all get out 
               of their seats... eating this up. Ronald fixes his hair.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Quiet! Let her choose.

               Without hesitation, Gretchen scans the class for every guy. 
               As she gracefully takes her seat next to Donnie, they make 
               eye contact. Donnie grins ear to ear.

               The class freaks out laughing.

               INT. TAURUS - SUNSET (MONDAY NIGHT, 6 P.M.)

               Eddie drives Donnie down Old Gun Road, a windy back-road 
               that goes towards the country.

                                     EDDIE
                         So how was school today?

                                     DONNIE
                         It was great. We had peanut-butter 
                         sandwiches and apples and honey at 
                         snacktime. And then during show-and-
                         tell, my stuffed walrus was a big 
                         hit.

                                     EDDIE
                         Good Lord.
                              (beat)
                         So the construction guys say it'll 
                         take about a week to fix the roof. 
                         Damn airline better not fuck us on 
                         the shingle match.

                                     DONNIE
                         Do they know yet?

                                     EDDIE
                         Know what?

                                     DONNIE
                         Where it came from?

                                     EDDIE
                         No... apparently they can't tell us 
                         what happened yet. Something about a 
                         matching serial number that got 
                         burned.
                              (beat)
                         But I had to sign a form saying I 
                         wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

                                     DONNIE
                         So we're not supposed to tell anybody 
                         what nobody knows?

                                     EDDIE
                         You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you 
                         want.

               Suddenly, Eddie slams on the brakes and the station wagon 
               comes to a sudden stop.

                                     EDDIE
                         Oh, shit!

                                     DONNIE
                         Grandma Death.

               Standing in the road directly in front of the car is Roberta 
               Sparrow (101 years old, a.k.a. Grandma Death).

               Grandma Death lives in a modest brick house that sits back 
               in a huge grassy field that overlooks the entire town. Her 
               mailbox sits on the edge of Old Gun Road.

               EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT

               Donnie gets out of the car and takes Grandma Death's hand, 
               walking her back towards her mailbox. He opens it for her.

                                     DONNIE
                         No mail today.
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe tomorrow.

               Grandma Death smiles back at him... and begins to walk slowly 
               back to her house. She then turns and takes Donnie's hands 
               into her frail grip.

                                     GRANDMA DEATH
                              (speaking slowly)
                         Every living creature... on this 
                         earth...
                              (beat)
                         ...dies alone.

               Donnie stands there silently for a moment, and then Grandma 
               Death turns back towards her house.

               EXT. DR. THURMAN'S RANCH - SUNSET

               We see a large colonial rancher in the distance.

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING

               Dr. Lilian Thurman (fifty-eight) is a beautiful older woman.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Your mother said that you've been 
                         skipping cycles of your medication.

                                     DONNIE
                         I've been taking it. I just like to 
                         make her feel guilty for all of this. 
                         You know, abuse her. Psychologically.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         All of this... certainly isn't your 
                         mother's fault, Donald.

               He is quiet for a moment.

                                     DONNIE
                         So, I met a new friend.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Would you like to talk about this 
                         friend?

                                     DONNIE
                         His name is Frank.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Frank.

                                     DONNIE
                         I think he saved my life.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How so?

                                     DONNIE
                         Don't you watch the news?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         I don't own a television.

                                     DONNIE
                         A jet engine fell on my house... 
                         landed on my bed. While I was talking 
                         to Frank on the golf course.

               Dr. Thurman looks at him for a long beat, analysing whether 
               or not he is telling her the truth.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm not kidding.

               Concerned, Dr. Thurman leans in closer.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Frank... instructed you... to get 
                         out of bed... just before this 
                         happened.

                                     DONNIE
                         He said to follow him.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Follow him where?

                                     DONNIE
                         Into the future.
                              (beat)
                         Then he said that the world was coming 
                         to an end.

               He rubs his arm, where the numbers are still lightly drawn.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Do you believe that the world is 
                         coming to an end?

                                     DONNIE
                              (long beat)
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         That's stupid.

               INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY

               In the empty school hallway... a gigantic tidal wave forms 
               in the distance and comes crashing towards us between the 
               lockers.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY TUESDAY MORNING, 2 A.M.)

               Donnie lies on the couch... fast asleep. His eyes slowly 
               open.

               There, standing in the corner of the room in the shadows is 
               Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         Wake up, Donnie.

               INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - NIGHT

               In the dark school hallway, Donnie rounds the corner with a 
               flashlight, a can of spray paint, and an axe. Frank stands 
               in the same hallway where the tidal wave crashed.

               INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - NEXT

               Donnie shines the flashlight through the basement. He 
               approaches some old piping.

               Donnie puts the axe back over his shoulder and then lowers 
               it fiercely. The smashing of metal against metal echoes 
               through the huge room.

               The same group stands and waits for the bus. The guys smoke.

               Cherita stands alone. Samantha is reading something to Joanie.

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (reading)
                         "And then the prince was led into a 
                         world of strange and beautiful magic."

                                     JOANIE
                         Wow.

               Donnie grabs the piece of paper from his sister.

                                     DONNIE
                              (reading out loud)
                         "The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Donnie! Give it back!

               He pushes her away.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         You're wrinkling it!

                                     SEAN
                         Hey, it's 7:45. The bus shoulda been 
                         here, like, twenty minutes ago.

                                     RONALD
                         Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts 
                         and hijacked the bus.

                                     SEAN
                              (excited)
                         You know, there's, like, this rule. 
                         We get to go home at 7:55.

                                     RONALD
                         There's no rule!

                                     SEAN
                         Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't 
                         show up in thirty minutes, you're 
                         supposed to go straight home.

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah... he's right. Because if we 
                         keep waiting, some guy in a van might 
                         pull up and try to molest us. And 
                         then our parents could sue the school 
                         board.

               Everyone starts to get excited... looking down the road to 
               see if the bus is coming.

               Sean's watch hits 7:55. No bus.

                                     SEAN
                         All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.

                                     RONALD
                         Let's go to Donnie's house. His 
                         parents are both at work.

               The three guys begin walking.

                                     DONNIE
                         Come on, Sam, you can call Joanie's 
                         mom from home.

               The two girls follow them. Cherita stands at the corner.

                                     DONNIE
                         Hey, Cherita... you should go home.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah, if you're still here and the 
                         bus comes, we'll get in trouble.

                                     CHERITA
                         Chut up.

                                     SEAN
                         Hey, porky pig. I hope you get 
                         molested!

               Suddenly, Emily Bates (ten) and Susie Bates (eight) run up 
               to the bus stop.

                                     EMILY
                         Hey! Our mom said that school is 
                         cancelled today because it's flooded!

                                     JOANIE
                         No... way.

               A horrible expression appears on Donnie's face.

               INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - MORNING

               A janitor named Leroy (fifty-five) stands at the end of the 
               hall with Principal Cole. Water rushes past their feet down 
               the steps.

                                     LEROY
                         I got twelve classrooms full of water. 
                         All coming from a busted water main.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         What else?

                                     LEROY
                         What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you 
                         ain't gonna believe what else.

               EXT. BACK COURTYARD - MORNING

               They stand before the bronze Middlesex mongrel. Spray-painted 
               on the concrete before it is the phrase: THEY MADE ME DO IT.

               There are papers strewn everywhere. Embedded in the head of 
               the mongrel is an axe.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         Christ. Is that an axe?

                                     LEROY
                         Yep.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         How did this happen?

                                     LEROY
                              (beat)
                         I guess they made him do it.

               Leroy can't help himself. He has to laugh.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         You're fired.

               Principal Cole walks off.

               EXT. BUS STOP 2 - EARLY MORNING (8:15 A.M.)

               Donnie, Sean, Ronald, Samantha and Joanie, Emily and Susie 
               walk from their bus stop.

                                     RONALD
                         School's closed! Everybody go home!

                                     EMILY
                         Nuh-uh.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Yeah-huh. A cat burglar broke him 
                         and trashed everything.

               Susie talks with Emily. Joanie and Samantha listen in.

                                     EMILY
                         Mom said that the boys' locker room 
                         looked like a swimming pool... and 
                         that they found faeces everywhere.

                                     SUSIE
                         What are faeces?

                                     EMILY
                         Baby mice.

                                     SUSIE
                         Aww.

                                     JOANIE
                         Oh my God, that is so grody.

               EXT. BUS STOP 3 - NEXT

               Sean looks down to another bus stop down the street.

                                     SEAN
                         School's cancelled!

               A bunch of young kids scream out... jumping up and down.

               EXT. BUS STOP 4 - NEXT

               Donnie approaches another corner alone. Ricky Danforth 
               (seventeen) and Seth Devlin (eighteen) stand with Gretchen.

                                     SETH
                              (smoking a cigarette)
                         Has anyone ever told you that you're 
                         sexy?

                                     RICKY
                         I like your boobs.

               Gretchen looks at them with disgust.

               Donnie walks into the group.

                                     DONNIE
                         Hey...

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Hey...

                                     DONNIE
                         School's cancelled.

               They look at one another, surprised.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (to Donnie)
                         Wanna walk me home?

                                     DONNIE
                         Sure.

               They quickly begin to walk off. Seth and Ricky look off at 
               them, furious.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Don't look so freaked.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm not. But you should check your 
                         backpack 'cause those guys like to 
                         steal shit.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Fuck them.

               Gretchen smiles at Donnie, and then turns back and gives 
               them the middle finger.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NEXT (8:30 A.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen walk along the sidewalk together.

                                     DONNIE
                         So... you just moved here?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Yeah. My parents got divorced. My 
                         mom has a restraining order against 
                         my stepdad.
                              (beat)
                         He has... emotional problems.

                                     DONNIE
                         Oh, I... have those too.
                              (beat)
                         What kind of problems does your dad 
                         have?

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (long beat)
                         He stabbed my mom four times in the 
                         chest.

               Donnie is shocked.

                                     DONNIE
                         Wow. Did he go to jail?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         He fled. They still can't find him.
                              (beat)
                         My mom and I had to change our names 
                         and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded 
                         kind of cool.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm sorry. I was in jail once.
                              (beat)
                         I accidentally burned down this house. 
                         It was abandoned. I got held back in 
                         school again. Can't drive until I'm 
                         eighteen.
                              (babbling)
                         I think when I grow up I want to be 
                         a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe 
                         both. Then I'll write a book and 
                         draw the illustrations like a comic 
                         book. You know, change things.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds 
                         like a superhero.

                                     DONNIE
                         What makes you think I'm not?

               Gretchen smiles. She looks over at her house.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         I should go. For physics. Monnitoff 
                         says I have to write an essay on the 
                         greatest invention ever to benefit 
                         mankind.

                                     DONNIE
                         That's easy. Antiseptics.

               She gives him a look.

                                     DONNIE
                         I mean, the whole sanitation thing.  
                         Joseph Lister... 1895. Before 
                         antiseptics there was no sanitation, 
                         especially in medicine.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         You mean soap?

                                     DONNIE
                         Don't knock soap. Without it, disease 
                         would spread rapidly. If we ran out... 
                         you and I would never live to see 
                         the year 2000.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Wonder where we'll be then.

                                     DONNIE
                         The best thing about soap is that 
                         it's the only thing on earth that 
                         can never get dirty. No matter what 
                         crap you throw on it... it always 
                         rubs off. And there it is again... 
                         perfect.

                         Until it withers away.

               She stares at him for a moment.

                                     DONNIE
                         It's a good thing the school was 
                         flooded today.

                         Why is that?

                         We never would have had this 
                         conversation.

               She smiles.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         You're weird.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         That was a compliment.

                                     DONNIE

                         Where are we going?

                         No... I mean, will you GO with me?  
                         That's like... what they call it 
                         here. Going together.

                         Sure.

               She gets up and begins to walk up the hill.

                                     DONNIE
                         Where are you going?

               TITLE CARD:

                                      OCTOBER 6 1988

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING (THURSDAY, 6 P.M.)

               Dr. Thurman sits next to Donnie. His eyes are closed.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         And when I clap my hands twice, you 
                         will wake up. Do you understand?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         So, tell me about your day, Donald.

                                     DONNIE
                         I met a girl.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What is her name?

                                     DONNIE
                         Gretchen. We're going together now.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Do you think a lot about girls?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How are things going at school?

                                     DONNIE
                         I think about girls a lot.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         I asked you about school.

                                     DONNIE
                         I think about... fucking a lot during 
                         school.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What else do you think about during 
                         school?

                                     DONNIE
                         I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Who is the boss?

                                     DONNIE
                         I just turn the volume down and think 
                         about fucking Alyssa Milano.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What about your family, Donnie?

                                     DONNIE
                         No, I don't think about fucking my 
                         family. That's sick!

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Donnie... I want to hear about your 
                         friend Frank.

               Donnie is now undoing his belt. He is no longer paying 
               attention.

               Dr. Thurman quickly claps her hands. Donnie jolts awake...  
               disoriented.

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY (FRIDAY, 8:30 A.M.)

               Donnie sits with his eyes wide open, staring at something.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                              (out of shot)
                         Aaron Armitage... Cherita Chen.

               Donnie's face has gone white.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         Donald Darko.

               We reveal on the blackboard the phrase, "They made me do 
               it", written over and over again.

               We reveal two Police Officers standing next to Principal 
               Cole in the corner of the classroom.

               Donnie gets up and walks over to the board and writes the 
               phrase.

               He then sits down again without hesitation.

               The Police Officer hesitates for a moment, lingering over 
               Donnie's penmanship. He then places a '?' next to Donnie's 
               name on the roster. Ms. Pomeroy makes eye-contact with him.

               INT. HEALTH CLASS - AFTERNOON (FRIDAY, 1 P.M.)

               We pull back from a television: a cloud formation blows across 
               the screen revealing a logo that reads: CUNNING VISIONS 
               PRODUCTIONS. A series of interviews follows.. infomercial 
               style.

                                     LINDA CONNIE
                         And what I realised was that my entire 
                         life I was a victim of my own FEAR. 
                         I was FEEDING FEAR WITH FOOD... and 
                         finally... I looked in the mirror. 
                         Not just IN THE MIRROR. I looked 
                         THROUGH the mirror. And in that image 
                         I saw my EGO REFLECTION.

               Donnie's health class is assembled in uniform rows in front 
               of a television cart. Ms. Farmer paces in front of them.

                                     SHANDA RIESMAN
                              (with her arm around 
                              her geeky son)
                         ...and for two years I thought it 
                         was NORMAL for a fifteen-year-old to 
                         wet the bed.

               Laughter from the students.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         QUIET!

                                     SHANDA RIESMAN
                              (choking up)
                         We tried everything. But the solution 
                         was there... all along.

                                     LARRY RIESMAN
                              (burst out emotionally)
                         I'm not AFRAID anymore!

               A montage of "family" imagery follows.

                                     NARRATOR
                         All across America... people have 
                         come together to join hands. People 
                         who believe that human life is too 
                         important... too valuable to be 
                         controlled by FEAR.

               A middle-aged man walks out onto a country patio. It is Jim 
               Cunningham... the guy from the golf course.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Hello. My name is Jim Cunningham. 
                         And welcome to "Controlling Fear".

               The title CONTROLLING FEAR appears on the screen... followed 
               by PART ONE: ATTITUDINAL BELIEFS.

                                     FRANK (V.O.)
                         Pay close attention, you could miss 
                         something.

               Donnie stares at the screen... at Jim Cunningham.

               EXT. OLD GUN RUINS - AFTERNOON (FRIDAY MAGIC HOUR, 4:30 
               P.M.)

               The ruins of a brick chimney sit in the middle of a field. 
               Donnie, Sean and Ronald have lined up several empty beer 
               bottles, cans and stuffed animals on the hearth.

               They take turns blasting these targets with a BB gun.

               Blam! A can falls over. Ronald hands the gun to Donnie. Sean 
               pulls out a bottle of Raspberry Night Train and takes a sip. 
               He hands the bottle to Ronald.

                                     RONALD
                         What is this shit?

                                     SEAN
                         Raspberry.

               He takes a big sip... which results in a dry heave.

                                     RONALD
                         Raspberry. That's good shit.

               Donnie aims the crosshairs on Smurfette's head. He pulls the 
               trigger. Smurfette falls over.

                                     RONALD
                         Wicked.

                                     SEAN
                         No more fuckin' for her.

                                     RONALD
                         Smurfette doesn't fuck.

                                     SEAN
                         Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the 
                         other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf 
                         made her, 'cause the other smurfs 
                         were getting too horny.

                                     RONALD
                         Not Vanity. He's a homo.

               Blam! A bottle shatters.

                                     SEAN
                         Then she fucks 'em all while Vanity 
                         watches. And Papa Smurf films it.

               Ronald takes another sip of Night Train... followed by another 
               dry heave. Blam! A bottle breaks.

                                     DONNIE
                         First of all... Papa Smurf didn't 
                         create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She 
                         was sent in as Gargemel's evil spy, 
                         with the intention of destroying the 
                         smurf village. But the overwhelming 
                         Goodness of the Smurf Way of Life 
                         transformed her into the Smurfette 
                         we all know and love. And as for the 
                         whole gang-bang scenario... it just 
                         couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. 
                         They probably don't even have 
                         reproductive organs down there under 
                         those little white pants. The only 
                         reason they exist is because of magic 
                         spells and witchcraft... which is 
                         all a bunch of bullshit if you ask 
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         That's what's so illogical about the 
                         smurfs... what's the point of living 
                         if you don't have a dick?

               Donnie aims the gun... pulls the trigger. Blam! A bottle 
               breaks.

                                     RONALD
                         Dammit, Donnie! Why do you always 
                         gotta get all smart on us!

               Donnie takes the bottle of Night Train and takes a small 
               sip.

               Their conversation is interrupted by the squealing of tyres.

               EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT (MAGIC HOUR, 5 P.M.)

               Down the hill, a Dodge minivan is stopped on Old Gun Road.

               Grandma Death is once again in the middle of the street.

                                     DONNIE
                         Grandma Death.

               Ms. farmer leans her head out of the window.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Excuse me!

               Grandma Death doesn't hear her. She wanders around in circles.

               Furious, Ms. Farmer gets out of the car and walks over to 
               the old woman, walking her by the shoulders back to her 
               driveway.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Please stay out of the road, Ms. 
                         Sparrow. If this happens again, I'm 
                         going to call social services.

               Ms. Farmer gets back behind the wheel and they drive off.

               Grandma Death lurks around her mailbox.

                                     RONALD
                         How old is Grandma Death?

                                     DONNIE
                         A hundred and one, I think. Every 
                         day she does the same thing. But 
                         there's never any mail.

               Grandma Death approaches the mailbox.

                                     SEAN
                         Here we go... this could be it.

               She opens it... then closes it. Walks away.

                                     RONALD
                         Awwww. That sucks.

               She approaches the box again...

                                     SEAN
                         Wait a minute... we may still have 
                         mail...

               Opens it... closes it. Walks away.

                                     RONALD
                         Noooo!

               They continue to watch her, sipping liquor into the sunset, 
               as Grandma Death repeats this act like an ancient wind-up 
               doll.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (FRIDAY, 7 P.M.)

               Donnie lies on the couch watching television... where there 
               is a news story about the flooded school. Several construction 
               workers are packing up their things.

               INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER (7:15 P.M.)

               Looking nauseous, Donnie opens the medicine cabinet and 
               retrieves his pills. He takes four of them. Donnie takes a 
               drink of water, closing his eyes. He puts the pills back and 
               closes the cabinet.

               In the mirror's reflection is Frank. Donnie jumps.

                                     FRANK
                         You got away with it. Don't worry.

               Donnie reaches his hand out towards Frank and it presses 
               against an invisible wall, as if he were pressing his hand 
               against liquid glass.

                                     DONNIE
                         How can you do that?

                                     FRANK
                         I can do anything I want... and so 
                         can you...

               Donnie stares closely at Frank. He then removes his hands 
               and moves back away from him.

               EXT. MIDDLESEX SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

               A sign reads: EMERGENCY PTA MEETING TONIGHT.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

               Parents and teachers convene in front of the auditorium 
               entrance.

               Kitty Farmer hands out Xeroxed images of something.

               Eddie and Rose chit-chat with other concerned parents.

               Ms. Pomeroy approaches Kitty Farmer.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         What are you trying to accomplish 
                         here?

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (indignant)
                         There was urine and faeces flooded 
                         in my office.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER ON

               The crowd settles... Principal Cole takes the stage.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         In co-operation with the county 
                         police, we have begun an active 
                         investigation into the cause of the 
                         flooding... and our suspects include 
                         several of our own students.

               Kitty Farmer stands up in her seat near the front row.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         I want to know why this FILTH is 
                         being taught to our children.

               The crowd stirs.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         Kitty, I would appreciate... if you 
                         could wait...

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... 
                         but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex 
                         child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person 
                         here who transcends the parent-teacher 
                         bridge.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         Kitty...

                                     MS. FARMER
                         The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is 
                         that there is material being taught 
                         to our children that is cause for 
                         this destructive behaviour.

               She stands up.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         I have in my hand Graham Greene's 
                         "The Destructors". This short story 
                         is part of my daughter's English 
                         assignment. In this story, several 
                         children destroy an elderly man's 
                         house from inside out. They destroy 
                         his house without motive, without 
                         moral consequence. They destroy 
                         private property... and they get 
                         away with it.

               Ms. Pomeroy shakes her head bitterly.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         And how do they do this? They FLOOD 
                         the house... by breaking through the 
                         water main!

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                              (trying to calm her)
                         This meeting of the PTA was called 
                         to inform the parents of our ongoing 
                         investigation...

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (enraged)
                         I AM THE PTA! And I say that this 
                         FILTH is directly related to this 
                         vandalism.

               Applause from the crowd.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         I think this garbage should be 
                         removed.

               Several shouts of approval come from the crowd.

               INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - EVENING

               Donnie continues to converse with Frank.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why did you make me flood the school?

                                     FRANK
                         We just want to guide you in the 
                         right direction.

                                     DONNIE
                         Who is... we?

                                     FRANK
                         You'll know soon enough.

                                     DONNIE
                              (desperate)
                         Where did you come from?

                                     FRANK
                              (beat)
                         Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

               A moment of silence.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Who are you talking to?

               Donnie turns to see Samantha is standing in the doorway. 
               Frank is gone.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               A heated debate among the parents is under way. Frustrated, 
               Rose stands up. Karen Pomeroy is furious.

                                     ROSE
                         Excuse me... but what is the real 
                         issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books 
                         from school.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         The PTA is here to acknowledge that 
                         there is pornography in our school's 
                         curriculum.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                              (standing up)
                         My GOD... woman, are you drunk?

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Excuse me? You need to go back to 
                         grad school.

                                     ROSE
                              (to Kitty)
                         Do you even know who Graham Greene 
                         is?

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (to Rose)
                         I think we've all seen "Bonanza".

               Ms. Pomeroy is disgusted. Rose and Eddie burst out laughing, 
               grab their coats, and leave.

               EXT. WIZARD'S ARCADE - AFTERNOON (SATURDAY, 1 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen play a Sega race-car driving game. Donnie 
               drives a souped-up red Ferrari through the Grand Canyon.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         So when you sleepwalk, can you 
                         remember afterward? Like, do you 
                         dream?

                                     DONNIE
                         No. I just wake up and I look around, 
                         try to figure out where I am... how 
                         I got there.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         My dad said never wake a 
                         sleepwalker... because they could 
                         drop dead.

               The Trans-Am crashes head on into a tree. Game Over.

                                     DONNIE
                         It's like this big force... that's 
                         in your brain. But sometimes it grows 
                         bigger... and it spread down into 
                         your arms and legs... and it just 
                         sends you someplace.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         So when you sleepwalk, you go 
                         somewhere familiar?

                                     DONNIE
                         No. Every time I wake up somewhere 
                         different. Sometimes my bike is laying 
                         there next to me. Like once when I 
                         woke up on the edge of this cliff up 
                         on Carpathian Ridge.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         And you'd never been there before?

               They sit silently for a moment.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Donnie?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Do you ever feel as though there's 
                         always someone watching you?

                                     DONNIE
                         Why?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Well... maybe someone is, like... 
                         giving you these dream steroids. And 
                         sleepwalking ...is someone showing 
                         you the way.

                                     OCTOBER 13 1988

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (THURSDAY, 8 A.M.)

               Donnie stands in front of the class. Ms. Pomeroy sits behind 
               her desk. On the chalkboard is "Poetry Day".

                                     DONNIE
                         "A storm is coming, Frank says. A 
                         storm that will swallow the 
                         children... and I will deliver them 
                         from the kingdom of pain."
                              (beat)
                         "I will deliver the children to their 
                         doorsteps. I will send the monsters 
                         back to the underground. I will send 
                         them back to a place where no one 
                         can see them... except for me. Because 
                         I am Donnie Darko."

               Donnie returns to his seat. Ms. Pomeroy stares at him 
               intensely.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Who is Frank?

                                     DONNIE
                         A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

               The class begins to laugh. Donnie looks over at Gretchen.

               INT. HEALTH CLASS - AFTERNOON (THURSDAY, 1 P.M.)

               Ms. Farmer stands next to the television where Jim Cunningham 
               narrates the Lifeline tutorial.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         And so, let us begin Lifeline Exercise 
                         No. 1.

               "PLEASE PRESS STOP NOW" appears on the screen.

               Ms. Farmer stops the tape and moves to the blackboard. On 
               it, she has drawn a horizontal line book-ended by the words 
               "Love" and "Fear".

                                     MS. FARMER
                         As you can see, the Lifeline is 
                         controlled by two polar extremes: 
                         "Fear" and "Love". Fear is in the 
                         negative energy spectrum. Love is in 
                         the positive energy spectrum.

                                     SEAN
                              (to Donnie)
                         No duh.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Excuse me?
                              (defensive)
                         "No duh" is a product of fear.

               She stares them down for a moment... shaking her head.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (handing out cards)
                         Now, on each card is a CHARACTER 
                         DILEMMA which applies to the Lifeline. 
                         Please read each character dilemma 
                         aloud... and place an X on the 
                         Lifeline in the appropriate place.

               The students read their cards.

                                     KITTY FARMER
                         We'll start in the front.

               Cherita Chen stands up and walks over to the blackboard. Ms.  
               Farmer pulls up large white cards that have black-and-white 
               animated cartoons on them.

                                     CHERITA
                         Juanita has an important maths test 
                         today. She has known about the test 
                         for several weeks, but has not 
                         studied. In order to keep from failing 
                         her class, Juanita decides that she 
                         will cheat on the maths test.

               Cherita places an X near the "Fear" end of the lifeline.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Good. Next.

               Donnie watches as several more students interpret their 
               respective human dilemmas.

               Finally... it is his turn.

                                     DONNIE
                         Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground 
                         filled with money. She takes the 
                         wallet to the address on the driver's 
                         license but keeps the money inside 
                         the wallet.

               Donnie looks at the blackboard.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't 
                         get this.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (impatient)
                         Just place an X in the appropriate 
                         place on the Lifeline.

                                     DONNIE
                         I just don't get this. Everything 
                         can't be lumped into two categories. 
                         That's too simple.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         The Lifeline is divided that way.

                                     DONNIE
                         Well, life isn't that simple. So 
                         what if Ling Ling kept the cash and 
                         returned the wallet? That has nothing 
                         to do with either fear or love.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (impatient)
                         Fear and love are the deepest of 
                         human emotions.

                                     DONNIE
                         Well, yeah... OK, but you're not 
                         listening to me. There are other 
                         things that need to be taken into 
                         account here. Like the whole spectrum 
                         of human emotion. You're just lumping 
                         everything into these two 
                         categories... and, like, denying 
                         everything else.

               Ms. Farmer stares at Donnie vehemently. She can't believe 
               what she's hearing.

                                     DONNIE
                         People aren't that simple.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (not knowing how to 
                              argue with him)
                         If you don't complete the assignment, 
                         you'll get a zero for the day.

               Donnie thinks for a moment... and then raises his hand.

               INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 P.M.)

               Donnie and his parents sit in front of Principal Cole.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         Donald... let me preface this by 
                         saying that your Iowa scores are...
                              (looking down at the 
                              file)
                         ...intimidating.
                              (rubbing his temples)
                         So... let's go over this again. What 
                         exactly did you say to Ms. Farmer?

               Donnie does not answer. We reveal Ms. Farmer standing in the 
               corner.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (furious)
                         He asked me to... forcibly insert 
                         the Lifeline exercise card into my 
                         anus.

               Silence. Rose looks down, furious. Eddie lets out a snort 
               laugh which he tries to conceal with a cough. It doesn't 
               work.

               INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE / OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER (2:15 P.M.)

               Eddie and Donnie exit Cole's office, moving on while Rose 
               approaches Kitty, who looks visibly shaken.

                                     ROSE
                         Kitty, I don't know what to say. 
                         They've suspended him for two days.
                              (beat)
                         Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly 
                         don't know what has gotten into him.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Rose, I'll tell you this because our 
                         daughters have been on dance team 
                         together for two years and I respect 
                         you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing 
                         your son's behaviour today, I have... 
                         significant doubts...
                              (stopping herself)
                         Our paths through life must be 
                         righteous. I urge you to go home and 
                         look in the mirror and pray that 
                         your son does not succumb to the 
                         path of fear.

               Kitty Farmer turns and walks away.

               EXT. DARKO BACKYARD / PATIO - SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR, 5:30 P.M.)

               Samantha jumps up and down on the trampoline.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (5:30 P.M.)

               Donnie walks into his room again for the first time since 
               the accident, looking around at the new furniture, paint and 
               carpet. Everything is perfect.

               Elizabeth appears in the doorway behind him with a cordless 
               phone in her hand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (into the phone)
                         Oh my God, remember that gym teacher, 
                         Ms. Farmer?
                              (beat)
                         Yeah. Well, I guess my brother called 
                         her a fat bitch today in class and 
                         got suspended. And my parents just 
                         bought him all of this new shit.
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine 
                         would have fallen on my room.

               INT. MARINO'S ITALIAN BISTRO - NIGHT (6 P.M.)

               Eddie and Rose sit across from one another at the bistro 
               patio... having a quiet dinner to themselves.

                                     ROSE
                         He's too old to be behaving this 
                         way.

               Eddie considers this.

                                     EDDIE
                         Oh, I say we buy him a moped.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

               Donnie lies in bed... looking up at the ceiling. He then 
               rolls over and looks at the calendar on his wall. The days 
               of the month of October are marked off with an X in each 
               square. Tacked onto the calendar is a drawing of Frank.

                                     DONNIE
                         28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 
                         seconds.

               INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (FRIDAY, 2:30 P.M.)

               As everyone is leaving class, Donnie stays behind.

                                     DONNIE
                         Dr. Monnitoff?

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Donnie.

                                     DONNIE
                         I know that this is gonna sound kinda 
                         weird... but do you know anything 
                         about time travel?

               Dr. Monnitoff pauses, turns and looks at Donnie. He seems to 
               know something.

               INT. PHYSICS CLASS - LATER ON

               Dr. Monnitoff has drawn a diagram on the blackboard. In his 
               hand he holds a copy of Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History 
               of Time".

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         So... according to Hawking... 
                         wormholes might be able to provide a 
                         short cut for jumping between two 
                         distant regions of space-time.

                                     DONNIE
                         So... in order to travel back in 
                         time, you'd have to have a big 
                         spaceship or something that can travel 
                         faster than the speed of light --

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Theoretically.

                                     DONNIE
                         -- and be able to find one of these 
                         wormholes.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen 
                         bridge, which is, theoretically... a 
                         wormhole in space controlled by man.

                                     DONNIE
                         So... that's it?

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         The basic principles of time travel 
                         are there.
                              (beat)
                         So you have the vessel and the portal.  
                         And the vessel can be anything. Most 
                         likely a spacecraft.

               EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - NEXT

               Cherita Chen listens to this conversation intently.

               INT. PHYSICS CLASS - NEXT

                                     DONNIE
                         Like a DeLorean.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                              (smiling)
                         A metal craft of any kind.

               Donnie stares at him intently. Dr. Monnitoff walks over to 
               his desk and picks up a book.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Don't tell anybody that I gave you 
                         this.
                              (beat)
                         The woman who wrote it... used to 
                         teach here a long time ago. She was 
                         a nun for many years and then 
                         overnight she just became this 
                         entirely different person. She up 
                         and left the Church, wrote this book, 
                         and started teaching science.

               Donnie takes the battered book... we see the cover.

               INT. SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

               Donnie stands before an array of old photographs. We zoom in 
               to a black-and-white photograph of a young Robert Sparrow 
               standing in a class photograph dated 1944.

               Donnie looks down at the book, and then at the photograph.

                                     DONNIE
                         Roberta Sparrow... Grandma Death.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FRIDAY, 6 P.M.)

               Donnie sits down for dinner with his family.

                                     DONNIE
                         It's called "The Philosophy of Time 
                         Travel".

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What does time travel have to do 
                         with philosophy?

                                     DONNIE
                         Guess who wrote it?

               No one seems to know.

                                     DONNIE
                         Grandma Death.

                                     ROSE
                         That is a terrible nickname.

                                     EDDIE
                         Grandma Death.

                                     DONNIE
                              (to Eddie)
                         You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost 
                         hit her with the car the other day.

                                     ROSE
                         I've heard she's loaded.

               The family is taken aback.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're right. Roberta Sparrow was 
                         famous for her gem collections. Kids 
                         used to try and steal stuff from her 
                         all the time. Over the years... as 
                         she got older, she became more and 
                         more of a recluse... now she just 
                         likes to stay up there all by herself.

                                     DONNIE
                         I guess she just lost faith in the 
                         world.

               EXT. DARKO BACKYARD - SUNSET (SATURDAY, 5:30 P.M.)

               Slow motion. Donnie and Gretchen jump up and down on the 
               trampoline, lost among falling autumn leaves.

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY (SUNDAY, 12 P.M.)

               Donnie is back on Dr. Thurman's couch.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How many times have you seen Frank?

                                     DONNIE
                         Four times... so far.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Can anyone else see him?

                                     DONNIE
                         I don't think so. It's like a TV 
                         station. And they're tuned into mine 
                         and no one else's.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Who is they? Is Frank part of some 
                         larger group?

                                     DONNIE
                         I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. 
                         That Frank is a sign. I told her I 
                         thought it was ridiculous.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         A sign from whom?

                                     DONNIE
                              (changing the subject)
                         I think that Frank wants me to go to 
                         this woman.
                              (holding up the book)
                         She wrote a book about time travel. 
                         Frank asked me if I believed in time 
                         travel. That can't just be a random 
                         coincidence.
                              (beat)
                         My dad almost hit her with the car 
                         the other day, and she said the 
                         creepiest thing. She said that every 
                         living creature on this earth dies 
                         alone.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How does that make you feel?

                                     DONNIE
                         It reminded me of my dog Callie.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Is Callie still around?

                                     DONNIE
                         No. She died when I was eight. We 
                         couldn't find her for days. She went 
                         and crawled underneath our back 
                         porch...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Do you feel alone right now?

               He looks at her for a moment.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'd like to believe that I'm not... 
                         but I've just never seen any proof. 
                         So I just choose not to bother with 
                         it. It's, like, I could spend my 
                         whole life thinking about it... 
                         debating it in my head. Weighing the 
                         pros and cons. And in the end, I 
                         still wouldn't have any proof. So... 
                         I don't even debate it any more.  
                         Because it's absurd.
                              (beat)
                         I don't want to be alone.
                              (beat)
                         So, does that make me, like, an 
                         atheist?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         No. That makes you keep searching.

               Donnie takes this in for a moment.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (SUNDAY, 7:15 P.M.)

               Eddie and Dr. Fisher watch the Redskins game. Ronald and 
               Donnie watch the game in the family room.

                                     EDDIE
                         Ahh... we need Theisman.

                                     DR. FISHER
                         We need a miracle.

               INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

               Rose and Anne Fisher (forty-five) share a bottle of wine at 
               the kitchen table.

                                     ANNE
                         And so, his tapes made me realise 
                         that for forty-five years I have 
                         been a a prisoner of fear. Rose, you 
                         have to meet Jim Cunningham.
                              (taking a sip of wine)
                         I can't believe he's not married.

               Samantha bounces through the kitchen and into the family 
               room, wearing a Dorothy outfit from "The Wizard of Oz".

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               Donnie sits back in the La-Z Boy, dozing off...

               John Madden's CBS chalkboard unfolds on the TV screen. Madden 
               traces his electronic lines across the screen, tracing the 
               movement of the players... as their images are frozen in 
               time.

               Donnie's eyes close... and then re-open.

               Donnie turns his head and sees that the room is momentarily 
               bathed in artificial white light, as if God hit the slow-
               motion button during a flash of lightning.

               Donnie turns his head and sees that protruding from his 
               father's stomach... is a thick spear made of silvery plastic 
               gel.

               As Eddie gets up from the couch to walk over to the 
               refrigerator... his spear precedes him... morphing into an 
               extruded arrow that reaches the refrigerator several seconds 
               before him.

               The spear traces the exact geography of his movement through 
               time... using his centre of gravity as its axis point.

               Donnie turns and sees Samantha skipping from the kitchen... 
               as her spear bounces several feet in front of her like a 
               caterpillar.

               Her spear... smaller than her father's... is proportional to 
               her mass.

                                     SAMANTHA
                              (her voice echoing 
                              through the silence)
                         Follow the yellow brick road...

               Donnie looks down at his stomach and sees his own spear 
               protruding outward. It then begins to extrude forward towards 
               the foyer.

               He does not follow it. It then retreats back in and beckons 
               him to follow.

               Like a child transfixed by a firefly... Donnie follows the 
               path of his spear into the foyer.

               INT. FOYER / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NXT

               Donnie and his spear round the corner and arrive in his 
               parents' bedroom.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               His spear leads him to the closet. He opens the closet door... 
               and the spear leads him down to a box hidden beneath his 
               father's shoe rack.

               Donnie removes the box from the closet and unlatches it. 
               Inside is a gun. Donnie removes the pistol from the box... 
               staring at it with the same childlike expression.

               Suddenly... Donnie's universe snaps back to normal. The white 
               light strobes... the spear has vanished.

               Donnie still holds the gun. His expression changes to nervous 
               shock.

               His eyes linger over the gun for a moment, he then quickly 
               puts it back in the box... and carefully places the box back 
               under the shoe rack.

               TITLE CARD:

                                     OCTOBER 18 1988

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (8:30 A.M.)

               We see the students placing the Graham Greene books on Ms.  
               Pomeroy's desk.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         It gives me no pleasure to deny you 
                         the right to read one of the great 
                         writers of the twentieth century. 
                         But... alas, I have not yet been 
                         elected Queen of the Universe. And 
                         until that day, I will be forced to 
                         obey the rules... and so will you. 
                         So... if anyone is found carrying 
                         this book in school, they will be 
                         suspended.

               Donnie slips his book into his backpack.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         But let's not worry. Someone has 
                         already pre-ordered several dozen 
                         copies at Sarasota Mall Waldenbooks. 
                         now, in Mr. Greene's absence, we 
                         will be reading another classic. 
                         Richard Adams' "Watership Down".

               She begins to hand out copies of the paperback novel. Beth 
               Farmer smiles when she sees the cover.

                                     BETH
                         Awww. Bunnies.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                              (whispering in his 
                              ear)
                         Donnie, maybe you and Frank can read 
                         this one together.

               INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MIDDAY (11:30 A.M.)

               Donnie walks along the edge of the school. Suddenly, a figure 
               approaches, grabbing him from behind, placing a switchblade 
               next to his throat It is Seth Devlin.

                                     SETH
                         Did you tell them that I flooded the 
                         school?

                                     DONNIE
                         I didn't say shit.

                                     SETH
                         That's not what I heard. Now they 
                         think I did it.

                                     DONNIE
                         Well, if you're innocent, then you 
                         have nothing to worry about.

                                     SETH
                         You know what? I think that you did 
                         it.

               Seth takes the knife and pokes the tip softly into the flesh 
               of Donnie's neck, drawing a small amount of blood.

               He pushes Donnie away. Donnie touches his neck in shock.

               INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (2:30 P.M.)

               Donnie walks into the classroom and takes his seat next to 
               Gretchen. He is sweating profusely.

               Dr. Monnitoff is handing out papers. The bell rings People 
               shuffle out.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Don't forget tomorrow we'll be meeting 
                         with our partners for the Young 
                         Inventors Fair.

               Donnie rubs his finger over his neck wound.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         What happened to your neck?

                                     DONNIE
                         I don't want to talk about it.
                              (changing the subject)
                         So what happened to your neck?

               EXT. GOLF COURSE FOREST - THAT AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen walk around the trail.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Were you ever afraid of the dark?

               They pull over to a stop.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why?

               She thinks for a moment.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Babies cry because they're afraid of 
                         the dark. And because they have no 
                         memories... for all they know... 
                         every night could be the last forever. 
                         Like, perpetual darkness.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why not just buy your baby a night 
                         light?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         That's not good enough. You've got 
                         to go back in time and take all those 
                         hours of darkness and pain and replace 
                         them... with whatever you wanted.

                                     DONNIE
                         With, like, images?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the 
                         Grand Canyon. Things that remind you 
                         how beautiful the world can be.

               Donnie stops and takes Gretchen's hand.

                                     DONNIE
                         You know... we've been going together 
                         for a week and a half...

                                     GRETCHEN
                         And what?

                                     DONNIE
                         Well...

                                     GRETCHEN
                         You want to kiss me...

               Donnie goes in for an awkward kiss... but Gretchen turns and 
               denies him.

               Donnie turns away, embarrassed.

                                     DONNIE
                         That's alright... I understand.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (embarrassed)
                         No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

                                     DONNIE
                         I always wanted it to be at a time 
                         when... when it reminds you how 
                         beautiful the world can be.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Yeah. And right now there's some fat 
                         guy over there watching us.

               A man in a red jogging suit is standing there in the forest 
               smoking a cigarette. He turns away... disappearing into the 
               woods.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - LATER THAT AFTERNOON (4 P.M.)

               Donnie rides along the sidewalk... and skids to a stop, seeing 
               a wallet lying there.

               Donnie opens the wallet, looking at the ID. It reads:

                  JIM CUNNINGHAM 42 POWDERHAM DRIVE MIDDLESEX, VA 23113

                                     FRANK (V.O.)
                              (echoing in Donnie's 
                              head)
                         Now you know where he lives.

               Donnie looks over and sees that he is in front of Cunningham's 
               Tudor mansion.

               INT. KITCHEN - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

               Donnie sits at the kitchen island with Elizabeth, carving a 
               pumpkin.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         So I hear you have a girlfriend.

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What's her name?

                                     DONNIE
                         You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (defensive)
                         Why would I tell Mom?

                                     DONNIE
                         Because you tell Mom everything.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No I don't.
                              (long beat)
                         She worries about you.

                                     DONNIE
                         Well, don't worry... I'm taking my 
                         medication.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's not that. I mean mouthing off 
                         to your teachers. I'll admit... when 
                         Dad told me what you said to Ms. 
                         Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

                                     DONNIE
                         I was just being honest.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Yeah... well, that's not the way the 
                         world works. If you keep being too 
                         honest, the world will eventually 
                         find a way to destroy you.

                                     DONNIE
                         Her name is Gretchen.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's a nice name.
                              (beat)
                         OK, let me see it.

               Donnie turns the carved jack o' lantern around and we see 
               that it looks remarkably like Frank.

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NIGHT (8 P.M.)

               Rose and Eddie sit in front of Dr. Thurman.

                                     ROSE
                         Thank you for seeing us... We... 
                         just felt that it was time to 
                         discuss...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What I think is going on with your 
                         son.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you know about his past. And 
                         when you said to look for signs of 
                         aggression... He was recently 
                         suspended from school for insulting 
                         his gym teacher.

                                     EDDIE
                         She deserved it.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Rose... let me just lay out what I 
                         believe is happening here. Donnie's 
                         aggressive behaviour seems to stem 
                         from his increased detachment from 
                         reality. His inability to cope with 
                         the forces in the world that he 
                         perceives to be threatening.

               Rose smiles nervously.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Has your son ever told you about 
                         Frank?

                                     ROSE
                         Come again?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?

                                     ROSE
                         Frank?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Donnie is experiencing what is 
                         commonly called a daylight 
                         hallucination.

                                     ROSE
                         You're telling me my son has an 
                         imaginary friend?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         He has described lengthy 
                         conversations... physical encounters 
                         with what I believe to be a 
                         manifestation of his subconscious 
                         mind.

               Rose looks over at Eddie with an expression of panic.

                                     ROSE
                         I... What can we do?

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         I would like to put him through more 
                         hypnotherapy... and increase his 
                         medication.

               Eddie looks at Rose... who nods in approval.

                                     ROSE
                         If that's what you think is necessary.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         But let me remind you that this 
                         treatment is... experimental.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Donnie walks into the kitchen and removes a butcher's knife 
               from a drawer.

               INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Donnie stands in front of the bathroom mirror... catatonic...  
               looking at his reflection.

               Frank stands behind him.

               Suddenly, Donnie turns around with the butcher's knife and 
               lunges at Frank with all of his weight.

               The knife collides with Frank's invisible force field as if 
               it were liquid steel. Donnie lunges repeatedly at Frank with 
               psychotic rage... but the knife bounces off.

               TITLE CARD:

                                     OCTOBER 20 1988

               INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MORNING (10 A.M.)

               The auditorium is packed with Middlesex mongrels. Jim 
               Cunningham takes the stage.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                              (shouting)
                         Good morning, mongrels!

                                     AUDIENCE
                              (scattered voices)
                         Good morning...

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         That's all the gusta you can musta? 
                         I said, "Good morning!"

                                     AUDIENCE
                              (yelling louder)
                         Good MORNING!

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Now that's better... but I still 
                         sense some students out there... who 
                         are AFRAID... just to say GOOD 
                         MORNING!

                                     AUDIENCE
                              (screaming)
                         GOOD MORNING!

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Are you AFRAID?

                                     AUDIENCE
                              (screaming louder)
                         GOOD MORNING!

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Now that's what I like to hear!
                              (suddenly serious)
                         Because too many young men and women 
                         today are paralysed by their fears. 
                         They give in to their feelings of 
                         self-doubt... they surrender their 
                         bodies to the temptations of drugs, 
                         alcohol and premarital sex. Empty 
                         solutions. These are toxic 
                         chemicals... and disease-spreading 
                         behaviour.

               A large screen lowers behind him.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         I would like to tell you a story 
                         today about a young man whose life 
                         was destroyed by the instruments of 
                         fear. A young man searching for 
                         love... in all the wrong places.
                              (shaking his head 
                              tragically)
                         His name was Frank.

               On the giant screen, an image slide appears of a young cartoon 
               teenager whose eyes are whacked out on drugs. The title 
               appears:

                                   HIS NAME WAS FRANK.

               Upon hearing the name Frank, Donnie falls into a paranoid 
               trance.

               Gretchen, who looks extremely bored, leans over to Donnie.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Let's get out of here.

               Donnie ignores her. His eyes are locked on Jim Cunningham, 
               who begins his rousing re-enactment of the sad, unfortunate 
               downfall of Frank.

               Within minutes, Jim Cunningham has the crowd laughing... 
               enamoured of him with his cartoon slide show.

               INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NEXT (10:30 A.M.)

               Donnie is in a trance.

                                     DONNIE
                         We're moving through time.

                         What?

               The huge screen rises upwards and Jim Cunningham takes 
               questions from the crowd from portable mike stands in the 
               back of the auditorium.

               Several students get up and go to the mikes.

                                     DORKY GIRL
                         Hi. Um... my stepsister... like... I 
                         sometimes worry that she eats too 
                         much.

                                     OVERWEIGHT GIRL
                              (mortified; yelling 
                              at her sister from 
                              the crowd)
                         Shut up, Kim!

                                     DORKY GIRL
                         I'm just trying to help you!

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         There's no need to be embarrassed. 
                         Many times we eat because we are 
                         afraid to face the reality of our 
                         ego reflections. We shouldn't just 
                         look INTO the mirror. We should look 
                         THROUGH the mirror.

                                     DORKY GIRL
                         Thanks.

               Kitty Farmer runs out onto the stage and hands Jim Cunningham 
               a bottle of water and a towel. She gives him the thumbs-up 
               sign, and runs back offstage.

                                     LANKY KID
                         Um... How can I decide what I want 
                         to be when I grow up?

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         I think you should look deep within 
                         yourself... deep within your heart... 
                         and find what it is in the world 
                         that makes you feel LOVE. Just pure 
                         LOVE. And then go to that. In your 
                         studies... in your athletics... go 
                         towards love.

                                     LANKY KID
                         Thank you.

               Donnie gets up from his seat and goes to the mike.

                                     LARRY RIESMAN
                         What can I do to learn how to fight?

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Violence is a product of fear. Those 
                         who love themselves enough should 
                         have no need to fight another person. 
                         Learn to truly love yourself... and 
                         the world will be yours.

                                     LARRY RIESMAN
                         Okay.

               Donnie steps up to the mike stand.

                                     DONNIE
                              (furious)
                         How much are they paying you to be 
                         here?

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Excuse me? What's your name, son?

                                     DONNIE
                         Gerald.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

                                     DONNIE
                         Well, Jim, I think you're full of 
                         shit!

               There are rumblings from the faculty. Some laughter from the 
               student body.

                                     DONNIE
                         Are you telling us this crap because 
                         you want us to buy your book? Because 
                         I'll tell you something, that was 
                         some of the worst advice I've ever 
                         heard!
                              (to Dorky Girl)
                         If you want your sister to lose 
                         weight... tell her to get off the 
                         couch, stop eating Twinkies... and 
                         maybe go out for field hockey.
                              (to Lanky Kid)
                         You're never gonna know what you 
                         want to be when you grow up. Most of 
                         the time, nobody does. How about 
                         you, Jim?
                              (to Larry)
                         And you... Sick of some jerk shoving 
                         your head in a toilet? Then go lift 
                         some weights... take a karate lesson. 
                         And when he tries to do it again... 
                         kick him in the balls.

               More rumblings from the faculty... Laughter from the students 
               gets louder.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                              (getting angry)
                         I think you are afraid to ask me for 
                         advice. I think that you are a very 
                         troubled... confused young man. I 
                         think you're searching for answers 
                         in all the wrong places.

                                     DONNIE
                              (long beat)
                         Well, I think you're the fucking 
                         Anti-Christ.

               The crowd is stirring. Students break out into applause. 
               Principal Cole approaches Donnie and removes him from the 
               auditorium.

               Gretchen watches him go with a smile.

               EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (3:30 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen walk down the wooded road.

                                     DONNIE
                              (mumbling)
                         They suspended me for two days.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (stopping)
                         Are you okay?

                                     DONNIE
                              (long beat)
                         I've been seeing stuff... a lot of 
                         really messed-up stuff.
                              (beat)
                         Do you know who Grandma Death is?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Who?

                                     DONNIE
                         The old crazy woman who lives off 
                         Old Gun Road.

               Donnie takes out the book by Roberta Sparrow.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Oh, yeah.
                              (taking the book)
                         "The Philosophy of Time Travel". 
                         What is this?

                                     DONNIE
                         She wrote it.
                              (beat)
                         There are chapters in this book that 
                         describe the stuff I've been seeing. 
                         It can't just be a coincidence.
                              (beat)
                         Will you come see her with me?

               EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen stand at the end of Grandma Death's 
               driveway.

               Gretchen leads Donnie up to the front porch of the decrepit 
               house. She then rings the doorbell. They wait for several 
               moments... nothing happens.

               Gretchen then goes and peers through a window.

                                     DONNIE
                         I know she's here. She never leaves 
                         the house.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Maybe she's asleep.

               They walk to the end of the driveway, and Donnie stops at 
               the mailbox. He opens it... empty.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (pointing at the house)
                         Donnie, look.

               In an upstairs window of the house, the silhouette of Grandma 
               Death peers down at them ominously.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Donnie sits at his desk, sealing an envelope. The address 
               reads:

                 MS. ROBERTA SPARROW 22 OLD GUN ROAD MIDDLESEX, VA 23113

               TITLE CARD:

                                     OCTOBER 23 1988

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING (6 P.M.)

               Dr. Thurman looks at a diagram from Sparrow's book. Donnie 
               is pacing around her office.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         And they grow out of our stomachs?

                                     DONNIE
                         It was just like she described them 
                         in her book. Like they were alive. 
                         The way that they looked... moved... 
                         smelled. They were like workers... 
                         assigned to each one of us.
                              (long beat, then 
                              distant)
                         I followed my spear... and I found 
                         something...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What did you find?

               Donnie is silent for a moment.

                                     DONNIE
                         Nothing.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Have you told Gretchen about the 
                         spears?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah, but if I told her about the 
                         other stuff about Frank...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Are you embarrassed by these things 
                         that you see?

                                     DONNIE
                         You know... every week I come in 
                         here and I tell you stuff... and 
                         it's all embarrassing. I tell you 
                         stuff that I don't tell anyone else... 
                         and you know what? It's your turn, 
                         Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything 
                         else until you tell me something 
                         embarrassing about yourself.

               Donnie makes a "zipper lip" gesture.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                              (long, stubborn beat)
                         I once had an extended sexual fantasy 
                         involving Mr. Rogers.

               Donnie just stares at her.

                                     DONNIE
                         Whoa.
                              (beat)
                         That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing 
                         to be embarrassed about. I have sexual 
                         fantasies all the time too.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         I know.

                                     DONNIE
                         I mean... Gretchen... She won't even 
                         let me kiss her. She says because 
                         it's our first kiss... she's, like, 
                         waiting for this big... moment or 
                         something. I just don't get it. I 
                         just want to get it over with so we 
                         can move on to the good stuff.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         The good stuff.

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah... you know...
                              (whispering)
                         Fucking.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                              (cutting him off)
                         Have you ever made love, Donald?

               Donnie looks at her... and we know the answer.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (7:15 P.M.)

               The entire family is having dinner. Donnie is lost in a 
               trance.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Donnie, are you coming to my talent 
                         show tomorrow?

               Donnie ignores her.

                                     ROSE
                         He can't, Samantha. He's been 
                         suspended from after-school 
                         activities. Donnie... are you still 
                         with us?
                              (beat)
                         How was your therapy session tonight?

                                     DONNIE
                         Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so 
                         bad a lady. I can tell her anything.

               Rose appears surprised and then sad at this comment. She 
               looks at Eddie, who just looks down at his plate of food.

               EXT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (12 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen are at the front of the room, presenting 
               their invention. Dr. Monnitoff presides.

                                     DONNIE
                         So, we call them... IMGs.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Infant Memory Generators.

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy 
                         these glasses for your infant, and 
                         they wear them at night when they 
                         sleep.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         And inside these glasses are these 
                         slide photographs. And each photograph 
                         is of something peaceful... or 
                         beautiful. Whatever pictures the 
                         parent wants to put inside.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         What effect do you think this would 
                         have on an infant?

                                     DONNIE
                         Well... the thing is, nobody remembers 
                         their infancy. And anyone who says 
                         they do is lying. We think that this 
                         would help develop memory earlier in 
                         life.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Did you stop and think that maybe 
                         infants need darkness? That darkness 
                         is part of their natural development.

               Seth Davis raises his hand.

                                     SETH
                         What if the parents, like... put in 
                         photographs of Satan... pentagrams, 
                         dead people... stuff like that?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Is that what you'd show your kids?

                                     SETH
                         I mean, didn't your dad, like, stab 
                         your mom?

               Dr. Monnitoff looks over at Seth calmly.

                                     SETH
                         Get out.

               Seth begins to walk out. Gretchen doesn't answer. There is 
               only the 80 IQ grin... staring back at her face. The room is 
               silent.

               EXT. SCHOOL FRONT ENTRANCE - NEXT (2:15 P.M.)

               Gretchen walks out the front door. Donnie comes chasing after 
               her.

                                     DONNIE
                         Gretchen! Gretchen... wait up!

               She turns and faces him, tears in her eyes.

                                     DONNIE
                         I'm so sorry.

               They embrace... kissing for the first time.

               EXT. BYRD THEATRE - MAGIC HOUR (5:30 P.M.)

               The old-fashioned theatre marquee reads:

                                   HALLOWEEN FRIGHTMARE

                      THE EVIL DEAD / THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST

               Donnie and Gretchen approach the box office.

                                     DONNIE
                         Two for "Evil Dead", please.

               INT. BYRD THEATRE - NEXT

               Donnie and Gretchen sit in the middle of the huge, empty 
               theatre.

               "The Evil Dead" unfolds. They eat popcorn and watch silently.

               Donnie looks over and sees that Gretchen is asleep.

               Donnie turns back to the movie... beginning to look ill.

                                     FRANK
                         Feeling sick?

               Donnie turns his head over and looks across Gretchen. Frank 
               is sitting next to her.

                                     FRANK
                         I want to show you something.

                                     DONNIE
                         You have to do something for me first.

                                     FRANK
                         You have a request?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing 
                         that stupid bunny suit.

                                     FRANK
                         Why are you wearing that stupid man 
                         suit?

                                     DONNIE
                         Take it off. I want to see you.

               After a moment, Frank slowly reaches up and removes the rabbit 
               headpiece.

               Donnie's eyes widen.

               Underneath the headpiece is the human face of a handsome 
               young man. His left eye does not exist, because it has 
               imploded into the socket. There is blood oozing from the 
               wound.

                                     FRANK
                         Satisfied?

               Donnie just stares at him.

                                     DONNIE
                         What happened to your eye?

                                     FRANK
                         I am so sorry.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why do they call you Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         It is the name of my father... and 
                         his father before me.

                                     DONNIE
                         How much longer is this gonna last?

                                     FRANK
                         You should already know that.
                              (beat)
                         Watch the movie, Donnie. I have 
                         something to show you.

               Donnie looks at the screen.

               On the screen, "The Evil Dead" morphs into a Time Portal.

                                     FRANK
                         There's a storm coming.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever seen a Portal, Donnie?

               Suddenly... the screen morphs into an image of a large Tudor 
               house.

                                     FRANK
                         Burn it to the ground.

               Donnie pulls out Jim Cunningham's wallet from his pocket.

               Donnie contemplates his fate for several more moments, and 
               then gets up and walks out.

               EXT. BYRD THEATRE - NIGHT (6:30 P.M.)

               Donnie walks slowly past the theatre marquee.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

               On the stage, among blowing autumn leaves, Cherita Chen 
               performs a strangely beautiful mime act to Symphony No. 3 by 
               Henryk Gorecki.

               When her act is finally over, the crowd is indifferent, with 
               scattered applause and laughter. Ms. Pomeroy stands up and 
               applauds enthusiastically.

               Clearly affected by the laughter, Cherita walks offstage.

               In the front row, the entire Darko family has assembled.

               INT. AUDITORIUM BACKSTAGE - NIGHT (7:15 P.M.)

               Kitty Farmer stands with the five-member dance team in a 
               huddle.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Now girls... I want you to 
                         concentrate. Failure is not an option. 
                         And Bethany... if you feel the need 
                         to vomit up there. Just swallow it.

                                     BETH
                         OK, Mom.

               Jim Cunningham walks past them towards the stage. He stops 
               and touches Samantha on the shoulder... smiling.

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Good luck out there.

               She smiles nervously back at him. He exits onto the stage.

               INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NEXT (7:20 P.M.)

                                     JIM CUNNINGHAM
                         Thank you... Cherita Chen. That was 
                         Autumn Angel.
                              (clearing throat)
                         Next... it is my distinct pleasure 
                         to introduce to you... Emily Bates... 
                         Suzy Bailey... Samantha Darko... 
                         Beth Farmer... and Joanie James. 
                         They are... SPARKLE MOTION!

               The audience roars with applause as the lights dim.

               The following montage alternates between the auditorium stage 
               and Jim Cunningham's house.

               The stage lights slowly raise as the opening beat of 'West 
               End Girls' by the Pet Shop Boys begins.

               Under the soft stage lights... Sparkle Motion unfolds.

               Donnie approaches Jim Cunningham's house.

               Sparkle Motion... in perfect synchronicity.

               In the living room of the house... Donnie walks through, 
               dousing gasoline all over the place with psychotic force. A 
               trail of fire spreads.

               A mystery woman emerges from the back wall of the auditorium.

               A couch and curtains become engulfed in flames.

               Middlesex girls are jumping up and down in the aisles.

               Eddie and Rose are smiling ear to ear.

               Elizabeth Darko is cracking up at the entire scene.

               Kids are going bonkers in the aisles.

               The mystery woman takes off her glasses.

               Slow motion: fire engulfs a deer taxidermy.

               Ms. Pomeroy gets into the groove.

               The parents are now on their feet.

               The crowd roars even louder.

               Slow motion: Sparkle Motion stands triumphant.

               Slow motion: Donnie stands before a wall of flames.

               EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (8 P.M.)

               Cherita sits alone in the courtyard at the base of the mongrel 
               statue... defeated and alone.

               INT. BYRD THEATRE - NIGHT (9 P.M.)

               Donnie walks into the theatre and sits next to Gretchen, who 
               is asleep. As the credits to the film roll, Donnie wakes 
               her.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (disoriented)
                         What? How long was I asleep?

                                     DONNIE
                         The whole movie. Let's go.

               INT. JIM CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT (9:45 P.M.)

               Firemen walk through the charred room shining flashlight.

               A Fireman shines his flashlight onto a mysterious door with 
               smoke emerging from it.

               He kicks the door in... and shines the flashlight into the 
               dark hole.

               EXT. CARPATHIAN RIDGE - SUNRISE (5 A.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen lie awake on a pile of blankets... staring 
               out into the abyssal canyon.

               Helicopter shot: we swoop down over Carpathian Ridge... past 
               Donnie and Gretchen... over the canyon and the endless expanse 
               of evergreen forest.

               TITLE CARD:

                                     OCTOBER 22 1988

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE BACKYARD / PATIO - MORNING (11 A.M.)

               Donnie and Eddie are in the backyard raking leaves onto a 
               giant sheet.

                                     DONNIE
                         I know everyone thinks I'm a nutcase.  
                         I've been getting a lot of weird 
                         looks from people lately.

               They rake in silence for a moment.

                                     EDDIE
                              (angry)
                         Who's been giving you weird looks?

                                     DONNIE
                         A lot of people. Teachers. Younger 
                         kids. It's like they're afraid of me 
                         for some reason.
                              (beat)
                         But that's OK... because I know I 
                         deserve it.

               Eddie stops raking.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're my only son...

                                     DONNIE
                         I know, Dad.

                                     EDDIE
                         I know I'm not the best... 
                         communicator.
                              (beat)
                         But whatever happens in your life... 
                         whatever obstacles you come up 
                         against... you just say... and do 
                         whatever is in your heart. You be 
                         honest... and tell the truth... even 
                         if they look at you funny... and 
                         they will. They'll tell you that 
                         you're wrong. They'll call you a 
                         fool.
                              (beat)
                         But what you've got to understand, 
                         son, is that almost all of those 
                         people are full of bullshit... and 
                         they're scared of people like you. 
                         Because you're smarter than all of 
                         them.

               Donnie smiles at his father.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON (1 P.M.)

               Donnie sits on his bed and stares at the calendar on his 
               wall.

               Each day is marked with an X.

               He takes his pills from his nightstand... and downs three.

               There are noises coming from downstairs.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Donnie comes downstairs to see Elizabeth glued to the TV.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh my God, that's him. That's the 
                         guy from last night.

               On the television: a Newscaster stands in front of the charred 
               heap of what was once a large suburban house. Firefighters 
               mill about behind her.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         As firefighters continue their 
                         investigation, arson has not been 
                         ruled out as a cause of the fire, 
                         particularly because of the shocking 
                         discovery made earlier today among 
                         the burned ruins. In the basement of 
                         the house, authorities have discovered 
                         what has been described as a kiddie-
                         porn dungeon.

               Policemen emerge from the basement with several large boxes 
               of evidence.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Cunningham, who has become a recent 
                         celebrity for his motivational books, 
                         audio tapes and videos, ducked his 
                         head from cameras when he was arrested 
                         at the Sarasota Heights Golf Club 
                         this morning. In a vicious statement, 
                         Cunning Visions executive Linda Connie 
                         attacked the Middlesex Fire 
                         Department... claiming a vast 
                         conspiracy.

               Donnie stares at the television... speechless, horrified. On 
               the TV, Jim Cunningham hides his face from the camera.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh my God. Dad played golf with that 
                         guy.

               Donnie says nothing, turns around... and walks upstairs.

               INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (2 P.M.)

               Donnie and Dr. Monnitoff are having another in-depth 
               conversation.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Each vessel travels along a vector 
                         path through space-time... along its 
                         centre of gravity.

                                     DONNIE
                              (to himself)
                         Like a spear.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Beg pardon?

                                     DONNIE
                         Like a spear that comes out of your 
                         stomach?

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         Uhh... sure. And in order for the 
                         vessel to travel through time it 
                         must find the portal, in this case 
                         the wormhole, or some unforeseen 
                         portal that lies undiscovered.

                                     DONNIE
                         Could these wormholes appear in 
                         nature?

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         That... is highly unlikely. You're 
                         talking about an act of God.

                                     DONNIE
                         If God controls time... then all 
                         time is pre-decided. Then every living 
                         thing travels along a set path.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         I'm not following you.

                                     DONNIE
                         If you could see your path or channel 
                         growing out of your stomach, you 
                         could see into the future. And that's 
                         a form of time travel, right?

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                         You are contradicting yourself, 
                         Donnie. If we could see our destines 
                         manifest themselves visually... then 
                         we would be given the choice to betray 
                         our chosen destinies. The very fact 
                         that this choice exists... would 
                         mean that all pre-formed destiny 
                         would end.

                                     DONNIE
                         Not if you chose to stay within God's 
                         channel...

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                              (cutting him off)
                         Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue 
                         this conversation. I could lose my 
                         job.

               INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - AFTERNOON (2:30 P.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy sits across from Dr. Monnitoff. They both grade 
               papers silently.

               Dr. Monnitoff stares at her for a long moment.

                                     DR. MONNITOFF
                              (incredulous)
                         Donnie... Darko.

               She stares at him for a while, haunted by something.

               INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy sits across from Principal Cole.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         I'm sorry, Karen, this is a 
                         specialised school. We don't think 
                         the methods you've undertaken here 
                         are appropriate.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         "Appropriate".
                              (trying to contain 
                              her anger)
                         With all due respect, sir, what 
                         specifically about my methods do you 
                         find inappropriate?

               Principal Cole stares at her for a moment.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         I don't have to get myself into a 
                         debate about this, Karen, I believe 
                         I have made myself clear.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         You call this... clarity? I don't 
                         think you have a clue what it's really 
                         like to communicate with these kids. 
                         You don't think that they can smell 
                         your bullshit from a mile away? Every 
                         day that goes by... that we fail 
                         to... inspire them... is another 
                         moment that we all lose. And we are 
                         losing them to apathy, and this... 
                         prescribed nonsense. They are slipping 
                         away...

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                         I am sorry that you have failed. Now 
                         if you'll excuse me, I have another 
                         appointment. You can finish out the 
                         week.

               INT. SCHOOL OFFICE / TEACHER'S LOUNGE - NEXT (3:15 P.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy steps out from Principal Cole's office. She sees 
               Kitty Farmer and the Sparkle Motion girls milling about. The 
               mystery woman is there as well.

               Ms. Pomeroy glares at Kitty Farmer before leaving.

               EXT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - NEXT (3:30 P.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy steps outside through an emergency exit. She 
               stares out at the beautiful forest. Her eyes are filled with 
               tears.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         FUUUUUUUCKKKKKK!!!!!

               Hearing the scream from the distance, we see Cherita Chen 
               turn her head in shock as she walks alone along the edge of 
               the school building, eating her lunch.

               She and Ms. Pomeroy share a moment of eye contact before she 
               turns and heads back into the school.

               INT. MAIN SCHOOL HALLWAY - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

               Ms. Pomeroy walks slowly through the hallway, wiping tears 
               from her face.

                                     PRINCIPAL COLE
                              (over the intercom)
                         Good afternoon. It is my great 
                         pleasure to announce that the 
                         Middlesex Middle School dance team 
                         has been invited to perform on Ed 
                         McMahon's Star Search '88 in Los 
                         Angeles, California...

               INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFICE - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

               The Sparkle Motion girls squeal with excitement... jumping 
               up and down. Kitty Farmer pumps her fist in victory.

               Suddenly... Linda Connie bursts into the office, grabbing 
               Kitty by the arm. The teacher holds up a newspaper... where 
               there is a headline that reads: JIM CUNNINGHAM CHARGED.

               Kitty's facial expression goes from elation to horror.

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (8:30 P.M.)

               The classroom is dark. The students watch "Watership Down", 
               the movie.

               Donnie is asleep. Gretchen stares at him. Ms. Pomeroy stares 
               at Gretchen.

               Suddenly, she turns on the lights, turning off the TV.

               Donnie wakes up... with dark circles under his eyes.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         And when the other rabbits hear of 
                         Fiver's vision, do they believe him?
                              (cough)
                         It could be the death of an entire 
                         way of life, the end of an era.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why should we care?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

                                     DONNIE
                         Why should I mourn for a rabbit like 
                         it was a human?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Is the death of one species less 
                         tragic than another?

                                     DONNIE
                         Of course. A rabbit is not like us. 
                         It has no history books... it has no 
                         knowledge of sorrow or regret. I 
                         like bunnies and all. They're cute... 
                         and they're horny. And if you're 
                         cute and horny... then you're probably 
                         happy that you don't know who you 
                         are... or why you're even alive. But 
                         the only thing I've known rabbits to 
                         do is have sex as many times as 
                         possible before they die.

               He looks over at Gretchen, who looks angry at this.

                                     DONNIE
                         There's no point in crying for a 
                         dead rabbit... who never feared death 
                         to begin with.

               The class is silent for a moment.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         You're wrong.
                              (beat)
                         You're wrong about these rabbits. 
                         These rabbits can talk. They are the 
                         product of the authors imagination. 
                         And he cares for them. So we care 
                         for them too. We care that their 
                         home has been destroyed... and that 
                         their lives are in danger. 
                         Otherwise... we've missed the point.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         But aren't we forgetting the miracle 
                         of storytelling? The dea ex machina. 
                         The god machine. That is how the 
                         rabbits are saved.

               Gretchen looks across the room at Donnie with a disdainful 
               expression.

               INT. MAIN SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER (9 A.M.)

               Donnie approaches Gretchen at her locker.

                                     DONNIE
                         You want to skip fourth period and 
                         go to the Ridge?

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (angry)
                         What's wrong with you?

                                     DONNIE
                         What do you mean?

               She turns and walks off, leaving Donnie broken and dejected.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (6:30 P.M.)

               Donnie sits at his desk looking at an intricate drawing of a 
               cloud formation. On it he has written: THE PORTAL.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

               Rose and Eddie are in the kitchen. He is getting ready for a 
               business trip.

               Samantha is jumping up and down. Elizabeth is jumping up and 
               down, dancing with her.

               Donnie looks into the kitchen from the foyer, catching his 
               family in a serene, contented moment of happiness. A moment 
               that he chooses not to interrupt.

               TITLE CARD:

                                     OCTOBER 25 1988

               INT. / EXT. FOYER / FRONT PORCH - DAY (3 P.M.)

               Doorbell rings. Rose answers the door.

               Kitty Farmer is there on the front porch. She is wearing a T-
               shirt that reads: GOD IS AWESOME!

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         Kitty...

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Rose, we have a crisis.
                              (beat)
                         I am sure that you are aware of the 
                         horrible allegations against Jim 
                         Cunningham.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, I saw the news. Something about 
                         a kiddie-porn dungeon.

                                     MS. FARMER
                              (holding up her hand)
                         Please! Don't say those words.
                              (shaking her head)
                         Well... as you can see... many of us 
                         are devastated by this news. This is 
                         obviously some kind of conspiracy 
                         meant to destroy an innocent man. 
                         And I have taken it upon myself to 
                         spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence 
                         campaign. But unfortunately my civic 
                         duties have created a conflict of 
                         interest... which involves you.

                                     ROSE
                         Beg pardon?

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Rose... I have to appear at his 
                         arraignment tomorrow morning. And as 
                         you know, the girls also leave for 
                         Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, 
                         as their coach... I was the obvious 
                         choice to chaperone them on the trip.

                                     ROSE
                         But now you can't go.

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Yes. And believe me, of all the other 
                         mothers I would never dream of asking 
                         you, given the predicament with your 
                         son. But none of the other mothers 
                         are able to go.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so 
                         last-minute... Eddie is in New York...

                                     MS. FARMER
                         Rose... I don't know if you realise 
                         how great an opportunity this is for 
                         our daughters. This has been a dream 
                         of ours for a long time.
                              (beat)
                         Sometimes I doubt your commitment to 
                         Sparkle Motion.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

               Rose is standing in Donnie's room alone. She stares at a 
               drawing of Frank that he has tacked onto his bulletin board.

               Donnie appears in the doorway. Rose jumps.

                                     DONNIE
                         I feel like... I'm approaching 
                         something horrible.

               Donnie walks over and sits on his bed. Rose goes and sits 
               next to him.

                                     ROSE
                         I have to take the girls to Los 
                         Angeles tomorrow.

                                     DONNIE
                         Do you get to meet Ed?

                                     ROSE
                         If I'm lucky.
                              (beat)
                         So... I won't be back until the first. 
                         Your dad will be back on Sunday, so 
                         I've put Elizabeth in charge until 
                         then. She has the car... so she can 
                         drive you to your therapy tomorrow.

                                     DONNIE
                         How does it feel to have a wacko for 
                         a son?

                                     ROSE
                              (embracing him)
                         It feels wonderful.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE DRIVEWAY - MORNING (10 A.M.)

               Rose brings her luggage out to the airport van. Mystery Woman 
               loads Beth Farmer into the van.

               Donnie sits on the back-porch steps, watching everyone 
               silently. Elizabeth gives Samantha a hug.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're gonna win. I know it.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         So do I.
                              (to Donnie)
                         Bye, Donnie.

               Donnie waves goodbye.

                                     ROSE
                         Here are the keys to the Taurus. 
                         There's plenty of groceries in the 
                         fridge. And I left money on the 
                         kitchen table. And don't forget...

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll 
                         miss your flight.

               Rose turns... wanting to say goodbye to Donnie, but not 
               knowing how. She smiles and waves goodbye.

               Donnie waves back.

               Rose turns and goes to the van... handing the driver her 
               last bag.

                                     DONNIE
                         Mom...

               Donnie stands up and reluctantly approaches from the porch.

                                     DONNIE
                         There's nothing broken... in my brain.

               Rose stands there for a moment, looking at her only son.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Come on, Mom!

                                     ROSE
                              (to Donnie, holding 
                              back tears)
                         I know.

               She gets into the van, as Donnie and Elizabeth watch them 
               drive off.

               INT. SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

               Donnie walks up to Gretchen, who stands at her locker with 
               several other girls. The girls whisper to each other as he 
               approaches.

                                     DONNIE
                         Will you please talk to me?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good 
                         time.

                                     DONNIE
                         Then when? I have to talk to you.

               Gretchen walks away, looking back at him with apologetic 
               eyes.

               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MOMENTS LATER (3:15 P.M.)

               Donnie walks alone through the hallways... lost.

               He stumbles upon Ms. Pomeroy's room. She sits behind her 
               desk... which has been packed up into a cardboard box.

                                     DONNIE
                              (knocking on the door)
                         Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you 
                         be off with your friends, scaring 
                         old people?

                                     DONNIE
                         Where are you going?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         I don't know. That's a good 
                         question... but suffice to say that 
                         I am no longer your English teacher. 
                         They fired me.

                                     DONNIE
                         That's bullshit. You're a good 
                         teacher.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good 
                         student. Lazy... but a good student.  
                         Unlike most of the others, you 
                         question Mom and Dad's rules.

                                     DONNIE
                         What do I tell the rest of the class 
                         when they ask about you?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                              (long beat)
                         Tell them that everything is going 
                         to be just fine.
                              (beat)
                         It is up to the children to save 
                         themselves these days. Because the 
                         parents... they don't have a clue.

               Donnie looks at the blackboard. On it she has written in 
               perfect penmanship: "Cellar Door".

                                     DONNIE
                         What's "Cellar Door"?

                                     MS. POMEROY
                              (spaced out)
                         A famous linguist once said... that 
                         of all the phrases in the English 
                         language, of all the endless 
                         combinations of words in all of 
                         history... that "Cellar Door" is the 
                         most beautiful.

               She is silent for a moment.

                                     DONNIE
                         Cellar door.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Sometimes it's the only thing that 
                         keeps us going.

               She takes the box and crosses the room towards Donnie.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         So... will Donnie find his Cellar 
                         Door?

                                     DONNIE
                         I think I already have.
                              (beat)
                         But now she won't even talk to me.

                                     MS. POMEROY
                         Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let 
                         her get away.
                              (stopping at the door)
                         She was right about the rabbits. Go.

               INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NEXT (3:15. P.M.)

               And with that... Ms. Pomeroy turns and walks down the hallway 
               with her career in a cardboard box... heading towards the 
               bright Friday afternoon sunlight.

               Donnie walks back down the hallway... lost in his own 
               introspection.

               Across the way... at her locker... as Cherita Chen. Donnie 
               approaches her slowly like a cat.

               She turns from her locker... and they make eye contact.

               She looks at him warily, frightened. A book falls from her 
               arms onto the floor.

               Written in large letters on the brown book cover is his name.

               DONNIE DARKO.

               He comes face to face with her, grabs her earmuffs with both 
               hands, and touches his forehead to hers as if he were going 
               to kiss her.

                                     DONNIE
                              (long beat)
                         I promise that one day things will 
                         get better for you.

               Cherita holds still for a moment, trembling, and then jerks 
               back from him. Her earmuffs come off in his hands.

               She backs away from him slowly. A single tear rolls down her 
               cheek.

                                     CHERITA
                         Chut... up!

               She then turns and runs down the hall... disappearing from 
               sight.

               EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (4 P.M.)

               Donnie walks by himself... thinking... wearing Cherita's 
               earmuffs.

                                     OCTOBER 29 1988

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY (1:30 P.M.)

               DONNIE IS UNDER HYPNOSIS

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         And when I clap my hands together 
                         twice, you will wake up. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         So, your parents... why did you 
                         disappoint them?

                                     DONNIE
                         I... I was playing with fire.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Is it Frank who wants you to destroy 
                         the world, to set the world on fire?

               Donnie doesn't answer.

                                     DONNIE
                         People get hurt.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         But it was an accident. The house 
                         was under construction.

                                     DONNIE
                         People get hurt. I don't want to 
                         hurt anyone.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         But you were punished.

                                     DONNIE
                         Yes. I went to jail.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Do you wish that you were punished 
                         by your parents instead?

                                     DONNIE
                         They... didn't buy me what I wanted 
                         for Christmas that year.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What did you want for Christmas that 
                         year?

                                     DONNIE
                         Hungry Hungry Hippos.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How did you feel... being denied 
                         those Hungry Hungry Hippos?

                                     DONNIE
                         Regret.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What else makes you feel regret?

                                     DONNIE
                         That I did it again.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                              (alarmed)
                         You've done it again?

                                     DONNIE
                         Yes. I flooded my school... and I 
                         burned down that pervert's house. I 
                         think I only have a few days left... 
                         before they catch me.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Why did you do these things, Donnie? 
                         Did Frank tell you to commit these 
                         crimes?

               He does not respond.

                                     DONNIE
                         I have to obey him... because he 
                         saved my life. He controls me and I 
                         have to obey him or I'll be left all 
                         alone... and I'll never figure out 
                         what all of this means...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         If God exists?

                                     DONNIE
                         I think now that he might...

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Why?

                                     DONNIE
                         Because I'm so horny.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         God exists because you're horny.

                                     DONNIE
                         I think so. I think that's one of 
                         the clues. It's a clue that tells 
                         us... to keep going.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Where are we going?

               No answer.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Where are we going, Donald?

                                     DONNIE
                         I have the power to build a time 
                         machine.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         How is that possible?

                                     DONNIE
                         Grandma Death will teach me how. 
                         Soon.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Then how is time travel possible?

                                     DONNIE
                         It would have to be God's portal. 
                         They will lead me to it. Then I will 
                         go back in time... and I won't feel 
                         regret anymore.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         When will this happen?

                                     DONNIE
                         Soon. Time is almost up.

               Donnie gets up on his feet, staggering around the room. He 
               looks frightened... childlike.

                                     DONNIE
                         It has to happen soon, it has to 
                         happen soon.

               Dr. Thurman gets up and tries to control Donnie... following 
               him around the room.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         What is going to happen?

                                     DONNIE
                              (freaking out)
                         Frank is going to kill.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Who is he going to kill?

               Dr. Thurman grabs him, trying to get him under control in an 
               awkward embrace.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Who is he going to kill?

               Donnie stares across the office like a frightened child... 
               as the room becomes white with artificial light.

               Frank is there in the office... staring back at him.

                                     DONNIE
                              (freaking out)
                         I can see him right now!

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Where is he, Donald?

                                     DONNIE
                         He's right there... He can read my 
                         mind and he'll show me the way out 
                         of this. The sky is going to open 
                         up... and then He will reveal himself 
                         to me.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         If the sky were to suddenly open 
                         up... there would be no law... there 
                         would be no rule. There would only 
                         be you and your memories... the 
                         choices you've made and the people 
                         you've touched. The life that has 
                         been carved out from your subconscious 
                         is the only evidence by which you 
                         will be judged... by which you must 
                         judge yourself. Because when this 
                         world ends, there will only be you 
                         and him... and no one else.

                                     DONNIE
                         It's too late. I've already ruined 
                         my life.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         You will survive this... Donald. I 
                         promise you that you will survive. 
                         You must let me help you.
                              (beat)
                         And when I clap my hands together, 
                         you will wake up.

               She claps her hands together twice... and Donnie snaps out 
               of his trance.

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 P.M.)

               Donnie, calmed down and putting his jacket on, walks slowly 
               to the doorway.

               Dr. Thurman stands looking out the window.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Donald?

               Donnie turns back and faces her. Beat.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Your medication. They're placebos. 
                         Just pills made out of water.

                                     DONNIE
                         Thank you.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Donald, an atheist is someone who 
                         denies altogether the existence of a 
                         God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic 
                         is someone who believes that there 
                         can be no proof of the existence of 
                         God... but does not deny the 
                         possibility that God exists.

                                     DONNIE
                         Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

                                     DR. THURMAN
                         Goodbye, Donald.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Donnie walks into the kitchen, where Elizabeth is sitting at 
               the table.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (in shock)
                         I got in. I'm going to Harvard.

                                     DONNIE
                         Congratulations.

               Donnie sits down across from her.

                                     DONNIE
                         Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday 
                         night. It's Halloween Carnival. We 
                         should throw a party. We could totally 
                         get away with it.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (long beat)
                         Okay, but it has to be a small one.

                                     DONNIE
                         Everything is going to be just fine.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE - NIGHT (9 P.M.)

               Neighbourhood kids are trick-or-treating. The man in the red 
               jogging suit shines a flashlight towards the house.

               There are at least two dozen cars parked in front... and 
               somebody is already throwing toilet paper in the trees.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT (9:30 P.M.)

               The doorbell rings. Donnie answers the door... only to find 
               Sean and Ronald dressed in black with monster masks. They 
               are both carrying backpacks.

               Donnie is dressed in a black skeleton suit, and his face is 
               painted white like a skull.

                                     SEAN
                         We got eggs, water balloons, and a 
                         dozen rolls of toilet paper.

                                     RONALD
                         I stole four beers from my dad.

                                     DONNIE
                         There's a keg here.

                                     SEAN
                         Only pussies drink keg beer.

               They go back into the house towards the kitchen. There are 
               at least forty people, already quite wasted, many carrying 
               their own twelve-packs of beer under their arms.

               Almost everyone is wearing a costume. Donnie and his friends 
               weave through the crowd toward the patio.

               EXT. BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

               Donnie and his friends watching the party unfold.

               The party grows larger.

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Dr. Thurman paces around her office with the phone to her 
               ear.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The phone is ringing. The answering machine picks up.

               INT. FOYER - LATER ON (11 P.M.)

               The doorbell rings... and once again Donnie is the one to 
               answer it. To his surprise... it is Gretchen standing on his 
               front porch.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (very upset)
                         Hey.

                                     DONNIE
                         Hey. You OK?

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (walking inside)
                         My mom is gone.

                                     DONNIE
                         Where is she?

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (close to tears)
                         I don't know. She didn't leave a 
                         note. The house is all messed up.

                                     DONNIE
                         But you're OK?

               She nods yes.

                                     DONNIE
                         Did you call the cops?

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Yeah, they told me to get out of the 
                         house.

               Donnie takes Gretchen into the hallway and gives her a hug.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         I'm so scared... I just keep thinking 
                         that something awful has happened. 
                         It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

                                     DONNIE
                              (embraces her)
                         It's safe here.

               Donnie takes Gretchen upstairs. We reveal Elizabeth watching 
               them go.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               Elizabeth walks over to a friend.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (yelling over the 
                              music)
                         Have you seen Frank?

                                     FRIEND
                         No. I think they said they were going 
                         on a beer run.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT (11:15 P.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen sit on the bed. Gretchen takes a sip of 
               beer.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Some people are just born with tragedy 
                         in their blood.

               He kisses her. He then pulls back.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         What?

                                     DONNIE
                         There's something you have to know, 
                         Gretchen.
                              (beat)
                         Everything is going to be just fine.

               They lie down together... silently listening to the party 
               below.

               The phone is ringing. The answering machine picks up.

                                     ROSE
                              (on the answering 
                              machine)
                         If you're there, please pick up.
                              (beat)
                         Oh well... there's good news. The 
                         girls... they got three and a half 
                         stars... and they get to come back 
                         for the quarter-finals.

               INT. LAX TERMINAL - NIGHT (9 P.M. PST)

               Rose stands at a payphone while the Sparkle Motion girls 
               wait at the terminal.

                                     SAMANTHA
                         Semi-finals, Mom!

                                     ROSE
                         Sorry... semi-finals. Anyway... we're 
                         taking the red-eye back tonight and 
                         we should arrive around six a.m. I 
                         hope everything is alright. Bye.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT (12 A.M.)

               We move towards the grandfather clock and see the minute 
               hand reach midnight.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT (12:30 A.M.)

               Donnie and Gretchen walk downstairs. They kiss, and she goes 
               towards the family room.

               Donnie walks towards the kitchen, but then doubles over 
               against the wall in pain.

               Suddenly... the room blows out with a strobe of white light... 
               as costumed teenagers and their vector spears intersect in a 
               shimmering maze of chaos.

               Donnie slowly follows his spear as it leads him through the 
               crowd... directly towards the refrigerator.

               Donnie stares blankly at what he sees... scrawled in magic 
               marker on the memo board.

               It reads: FRANK WAS HERE... WENT TO GET BEER!!

               Donnie stares at the board for several moment... he then 
               turns his head and sees a teenager with a Ronald Reagan mask 
               walk by.

               He then sees another spear come towards him. Gretchen rounds 
               the corner, coming in from the family room.

               Donnie falls to his knees and puts his face inside the end 
               of Gretchen's spear. We see his P.O.V. -- an abyssal tunnel 
               of light.

                                     DONNIE
                         Come with me.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Where are we going?

               He grabs her and pulls her out the back of the kitchen into 
               the back yard. Ronald and Sean follow.

               EXT. BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

               They move through the backyard.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Donnie, what's going on!

               She stops him.

                                     DONNIE
                         Time is running out. We have to go 
                         see Grandma Death. We have to talk 
                         to her.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Why? Is this about the book?

                                     DONNIE
                         No. Frank.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Who's Frank?

               Ronald and Sean approach.

                                     SEAN
                         Donnie? Where are we going?

               Donnie looks at Gretchen... This is it.

                                     DONNIE
                         She knows. I know she knows.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NIGHT (1:15 A.M.)

               The group of hour ride their bikes down the street.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT (1:45 A.M.)

               They ride their bikes through the forest.

               EXT. GRANDMA DEATH'S HOUSE - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

               They stand in front of the dark house. It is pitch-black. No 
               lights anywhere.

                                     SEAN
                         There's nobody here... Just forget 
                         it.

               Then... there is a clanking noise from somewhere around the 
               side of the house. Everyone hears it.

               Donnie looks towards the lower front of the house where there 
               is a cellar door.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Is that a cellar door?

                                     DONNIE
                              (his eyes widen)
                         Yeah...

               The cellar door is ajar... and there is a dim light coming 
               out from inside.

                                     RONALD
                         Don't open it, Donnie. Let's just 
                         leave.

               INT. GRANDMA DEATH'S CELLAR - NEXT

               Donnie and Gretchen open the door to the cellar... and descend 
               down into a murky pit with a stone floor.

               Inside... the room is quite large... filled with row after 
               row of boxes, paintings, antique furniture and chandeliers. 
               There is even an ancient piano in the back.

               Gretchen slowly reaches her hand out and places her finger 
               on the deepest piano key.

               Suddenly a figure emerges from the shadows and slams Donnie 
               into the wall. He then grabs Gretchen by placing an arm around 
               her neck with a butcher's knife.

               It is Ricky Danforth. Seth comes out from another corner... 
               also brandishing a butcher's knife. Both have pantyhose pulled 
               over their heads.

                                     RICKY
                         Get the fuck out! Now!

               Ricky drags Gretchen out. Seth drags Donnie out.

               EXT. GRANDMA DEATH'S HOUSE - NEXT

               The four of them come bursting out of the cellar.

               Seth holds Donnie's arms down with his knees and places the 
               butcher's knife against his throat.

               Ricky throws Gretchen down hard onto the shoulder of Old Gun 
               Road.

               She lets out a gasp of pain as her head hits the gravel.

                                     RICKY
                         Motherfuckers!

                                     SETH
                         I have... a bigger knife now.

               Sean and Ronald watch... dumbfounded, backing away.

               Seth just stares down at Donnie with his dead eyes... pushing 
               the knife down harder, cutting off Donnie's air supply.

                                     SEAN
                         Hey... there's someone coming! Look, 
                         there's a car coming!

               Seth slowly turns his head and sees... far down Old Gun 
               Road... approaching headlights.

                                     DONNIE
                              (barely audible whisper)
                         Dea ex machina...

                                     SETH
                         What did you say?

                                     DONNIE
                         Our saviour...

               The headlights are getting close.

                                     RICKY
                         They called the fuckin' cops!

               Gretchen struggles to breathe on the shoulder of the road... 
               the wind knocked out of her, semi-conscious.

                                     SETH
                         That's no cop...

               The headlights are getting close.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (in a hoarse whisper)
                         Donnie...

               Even closer...

                                     DONNIE
                         You better run.

                                     RICKY
                         Forget it... let's go!

               Seth doesn't move... He just stares down at Donnie.

                                     RICKY
                         Come on! Let's go!

                                     SETH
                         You're dead, Donnie Darko.

               Seth gets up and runs off with Ricky into the forest... just 
               as the approaching car crests the top of Old Gun Road at 
               breakneck speed.

               Suddenly, in the bright glow of the car's headlights... is 
               the silhouette of Grandma Death... standing in the middle of 
               the road.

               In her right hand she is clutching a letter.

               Donnie's letter.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Donnie...

               The car swerves left, barely missing Grandma Death.

               The Pontiac tries to brake hard... but the wheels lock... 
               and it goes skidding onto the shoulder.

               Gretchen raises her head from the gravel... into bright 
               headlight beams.

               The Trans-Am goes barrelling over her like a speed-bump... 
               and her limp body rolls off into the grassy ditch.

               The Trans-Am skids off into the grass and collides head-on 
               with the crumbling stone chimney... which explodes into the 
               crumpled hood of the car... as it eventually comes to a stop 
               in a fury of smoke.

               Donnie staggers to his feet... regaining his breath. He runs 
               over to Gretchen and kneels down next to her.

                                     DONNIE
                         Gretchen... wake up. Wake up.

               Her neck is broken. She has no pulse.

               The passenger door to the Trans-Am opens, and a passenger in 
               a clown costume gets out.

               The driver's side door opens and the driver gets out.

               He is wearing a rabbit suit. A Halloween costume.

               He is holding the grotesque rabbit helmet in his hand.

               It is Frank.

                                     PASSENGER
                         Frank... what'd you do... what'd you 
                         do!

               Frank approaches Donnie... who raises his head from Gretchen 
               to see him for the first time... face to face... with an 
               expression of shocked horror.

                                     PASSENGER
                         She's dead. You killed her, Frank!

               Frank is in shock.

                                     FRANK
                         She's dead.

               Donnie slowly nods his head. Sean and Ronald approach him 
               slowly.

               Grandma Death looms behind them.

                                     FRANK
                         What the fuck. Look at my fucking 
                         car!

                                     PASSENGER
                         Let's get out of here. Let's get out 
                         of here, Frank!

                                     FRANK
                         What were you stupid fucks doing in 
                         the middle of the road?

                                     DONNIE
                         Waiting for you.

               Donnie raises the gun from his father's closet with his right 
               hand, and to his own surprise, he pulls the trigger.

               Frank's left eye implodes as the bullet passes through his 
               head. His body falls limply to the ground.

                                     PASSENGER
                         Holy shit...

               The Passenger turns and runs off into the woods.

                                     RONALD
                         What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you 
                         do!

                                     DONNIE
                              (very calm)
                         Go home. Go home and tell your parents 
                         that everything is going to be just 
                         fine.

               After contemplation of the recent events... Sean and Ronald 
               turn and run off in the opposite direction.

               Donnie is left alone... with the dead bodies.

               He turns and stares at Grandma Death... who is calmly standing 
               there... with his letter in her hand.

                                     GRANDMA DEATH
                         A storm is coming.
                              (beat)
                         You must hurry.

               Donnie is still in shock.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - EARLY MORNING (4:30 A.M.)

               Donnie carries Gretchen home.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               Donnie looks down at Elizabeth asleep on the couch. He then 
               leans down and gives her a kiss on the forehead.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NEXT

               Donnie walks out to the Taurus, then stops and looks up at 
               the sky.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NEXT

               The Time Portal begins to form above the house.

               Donnie touches his stomach... feeling sick once again.

               Donnie then steps into the car, where Gretchen sits in the 
               passenger seat. He turns on the engine and peels out of the 
               driveway.

               INT. FORD TAURUS - EARLY MORNING

               Donnie drives the Taurus up Carpathian Ridge.

               EXT. CARPATHIAN RIDGE - EARLY MORNING (5:30 A.M.)

               Donnie sits on the roof of the Taurus looking out.

               He smiles, lighting a cigarette.

                                     DONNIE
                         28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 
                         seconds. We're almost home.

               EXT. SKY - NEXT

               We see the Time Portal in the distance, forming.

               INT. FLIGHT 2806 - DAWN (6 A.M.)

               Samantha Darko is fast asleep. Her head rests on Rose's 
               shoulder.

               She looks out of the window at the rising sun.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE - DAWN

               The Portal continues to form above the Darko house.

               Police cars pull up in front of the house.

               EXT. CARPATHIAN RIDGE - DAWN

               Donnie continues to stare out at the canyon.

               EXT. SKY - NEXT

               We see the Time Portal once again.

               INT. FORD TAURUS - NEXT

               Donnie steps off the hood and gets into the car.

               He takes Gretchen's hand.

               INT. FLIGHT 2806 - NEXT

               On the plane, Rose looks out of the window as the jet wing 
               explodes (audio only... we don't see it). She screams out as 
               the cabin shakes violently.

               EXT. DARKO HOUSE - DAWN

               The Time Portal continues to form over the house.

               EXT. SKY - NEXT

               The left jet engine from Flight 2806 falls downward through 
               the sky. Beneath it, the Portal forms itself.

               EXT. SKY - NEXT

               The falling jet engine approaches the hexagonal plate of 
               light which accelerates downwards... forming a tunnel with 
               walls made of swirling liquid marble.

               The jet engine passes into the hexagonal plate.

               INT. / EXT. VARIOUS

               In a series of inter-velometer time-lapse shots... the entire 
               suburban landscape retreats backward in a fury of speed.

               Shot 1: a time-lapse of the mongrel statue.

               Shot 2: a time-lapse of the main school hallway.

               Shot 3: a time-lapse of the main school building.

               Shot 4: a time-lapse of neighbourhood street/Darko house.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               We move towards Donnie's empty bed.

               TITLE CARD:

                                      OCTOBER 2 1988

               INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

               Dr. Thurman wakes up.

               Jim Cunningham wakes up... sobbing.

               Kitty Farmer wakes up... coming to a horrible realisation.

               Karen Pomeroy and Dr. Monnitoff wake up together.

               Cherita Chen wakes up.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

               The jet engine falls silently through the night down towards 
               the Darko house... having travelled back in time.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NEXT

               Donnie wakes up. He is laughing hysterically.

               The engine crashes through his ceiling... engulfing the room.

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

               Eddie jumps up from the La-Z Boy... startled awake by the 
               impact.

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT

               Rose sits up in bed, hearing the crash.

                                     ROSE
                         Eddie?

               INT. FOYER - NEXT

               Elizabeth leans against the wall, screaming.

               INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NEXT

               The mammoth jet engine has plummeted all the way down through 
               the house, creating a cavernous hole that splits Donnie's 
               room in half. The smoke from the wreckage begins to clear.

               Above the engine is Donnie... impaled through the stomach by 
               a wooden beam that was once part of the floor beneath his 
               bed.

               There is blood gushing from his mouth, as his face is 
               contorted into an expression that could almost be a smile.

               EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - MORNING (11 A.M.)

               The same disaster scene as before... only more media, more 
               neighbours, and a Coroner. People stand around in shock...  
               disbelief.

               From the other end of the street, a girl comes riding along 
               on a bike... slowly taking in the entire scene. She pulls up 
               to the kerb where a kid named David (eleven) is standing 
               around.

               It is Gretchen Ross.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         Hi... what's going on here?

                                     DAVID
                         Horrible accident. My neighbour... 
                         he got killed.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         What happened?

                                     DAVID
                         He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

               She stares at the house, where paramedics wheel a body out 
               of the front door.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         What was his name?

                                     DAVID
                         Donnie. Donnie Darko.

               They stare at the front yard for a while. We see Elizabeth. 
               We see Eddie, carrying Samantha... who is crying.

                                     DAVID
                         I feel bad for his family.

                                     GRETCHEN
                              (long beat)
                         Yeah.

                                     DAVID
                         Did you know him?

               She stares at the family for several moments... and then 
               shakes her head slowly as if trying to locate a memory that 
               is slipping away.

                                     GRETCHEN
                         No.

               Rose, leaning against a tree while smoking a cigarette, 
               notices them. She seems to recognise Gretchen... from 
               somewhere in the vast reservoir of her memory.

               She waves at her.

               She waves back.

               Fade out.

                                         THE END
