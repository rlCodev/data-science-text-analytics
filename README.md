# Age Restriction Analysis of Movie Scripts
The goal of our project is to automate and extend the age rating of movies based on the script of the movie. The criteria for our evaluation will be primarily based on the official rating rules used by the [Motion Picture Association](https://www.filmratings.com/RatingsGuide).

### Future Planning

Currently, the project is behind schedule with respect to the initial milestone plan. This should be made up by the lecture break from 22.12.22 to 07.01.23.
One reason for the delay is the change in data sourcing. The operator of a platform for film scripts had unexpectedly stopped responding.
