# Age Restriction Analysis of Movie Scripts
The goal of our project is to automate and extend the age rating of movies based on the script of the movie. The criteria for our evaluation will be primarily based on the official rating rules used by the [Motion Picture Association](https://www.filmratings.com/RatingsGuide).
