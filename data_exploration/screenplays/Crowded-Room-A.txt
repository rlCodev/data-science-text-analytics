    --------------------------------------------------------------

    FADE IN:

    We don't know what we're looking at.  It's an abstract
    mass -- swirling lines in constant motion -- but we're too
    close to see any form.

    As WE PULL BACK, we can now make out that they are what
    seem like animated streaks of charcoal -- forming and
    reforming into a series of drawings:

    First, a small girl, clutching a rag doll.  She stares
    plaintively into the lens as around the edges of the
    frame, a male figure with a thick, black moustache,
    cradles her protectively in his arms.

    But this image quickly changes to a landscape -- evil and
    foreboding.  A desolate farmhouse against an overcast sky.
    Leafless trees with spiky tentacles for branches sprout
    like eruptions from the very bowels of hell.  It's every
    shade of gray -- ominous, depraved.

    Now we start to close in on this landscape's heart of
    darkness -- a constricted old corn crib -- but before we
    get close enough to see inside it, the scene shifts.  A
    pale, sad-eyed teenage girl looking straight at us.  Then
    we move to a line drawing of the rag doll that the little
    girl had clutched earlier -- only now it hangs from a
    noose, surrounded by long, shattered lines that recall the
    farmhouse branches.  The last shift leads us to a dark
    haired little boy, scared into impenetrable silence, as he
    is approached from behind by the immense, leering
    presence of an adult male.

    Finally, this Rotoscope animated picture transform itself
    into reality -- an actual oil painting, wet and glistening
    on a canvas.  It's the first image we've seen that has
    dimension or texture.  In a moment, a paint-stained hand
    enters the frame and feverishly smears the adult figure
    beyond all recognition with its fingers, leaving the
    little boy alone in the F.G.  Then, the hand leaves,
    returning with a paint brush.  It re-does the area
    surrounding the child in a wash of midnight blue.  As it
    does, we hear:

                             DONNA (V.O.)
              He had some kind of stain or
              something on his hands.

                             KLEBERG (V.O.)
              Stain?  What, like dirt?

                             BOXERBAUM (V.O.)
              Oil?

                             DONNA (V.O.)
              No.  They were blue.  Dark blue.
              All over his fingers.

                             KLEBERG (V.O.)
              Ink?

                             DONNA (V.O.)
              No.  I don't know what it was.  But
              it had a funny smell to it.


    INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

    DONNA WEST is a short, plump woman in her twenties, eyes
    red from crying, hair in her face, talking to POLICE CHIEF
    KLEBERG and DETECTIVE BOXERBAUM.  She's huddled across a
    table from them in a blanket.  Beside her stands a FEMALE
    POLICE OFFICER.

    A LEGEND COMES UP ON SCREEN: OCTOBER 22, 1977

                             DONNA
              Oh, God, I don't know.  I can't
              think.

                             BOXERBAUM
              Alright, don't worry about his
              hands.  Just try and tell us
              whatever you remember so that we can
              get a statement.

                             DONNA
              It was about eight A.M. and I was
              getting out of my car in the parking
              lot.

                             KLEBERG
              This is at Ohio State?

                             DONNA
              Yes, I'm an optometry student there.


    EXT.  PARKING LOT - MORNING

    DONNA WEST is getting out of her beat up Toyota.  We see
    what she describes.

                             DONNA (V.O.)
              I had gone around to the passenger
              side to pick up some books, and as I
              was leaning in...

    BILLY MILLIGAN, a regular looking guy, maybe a little
    burlier than average, with a full mustache and brown
    tinted sunglasses, enters frame.  He holds a small
    revolver, which he presses against DONNA'S arm.

                             BILLY
              Would you please get in the car?

    Frightened, she does.  BILLY goes around to the driver's
    side and gets in.  He takes out a pair of handcuffs and
    cuffs her to the inside of the door.  He goes through her
    bag and pulls out her car keys.  He starts the car and
    drives off.


    INT.  CAR

    As they drive away from the campus.

                             DONNA
              Where are we going?

    But BILLY is muttering to himself, oblivious to her
    question.

                             DONNA
              I know this is gonna sound
              ridiculous, but I have an optometry
              test today...

    He looks at her suddenly.

                             BILLY
              You can study for it if you want.
              This won't take long.  Go on.

    She picks up a text book with her trembling free hand and
    feigns studying.


    EXT.  ROAD

    As the car drives through a deserted stretch of
    countryside.


    INT.  CAR

    DONNA is "studying" stealing glances at BILLY.  Suddenly,
    BILLY grabs her bag and pulls out her address book.  As he
    rips out pages.

                             BILLY
              I'm taking these addresses and phone
              numbers.  If you say anything to the
              police, I'll send someone from my
              brotherhood after you.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    KLEBERG and BOXERBAUM.

                             KLEBERG
              His "brotherhood"?

    ANGLE

    But now we see they're not talking to DONNA WEST, they're
    talking to CARRIE DRYER -- a prettier GIRL also in her
    twenties, also very upset.  There's a sketch artist there.

                             CARRIE
              That's what he said.  He belonged to
              a brotherhood and they'd send
              someone after me if I said anything.

                             BOXERBAUM
              Was he high?  Could you tell?

                             CARRIE
              It's weird.  There was liquor on his
              breath... I mean he reeked... but he
              drove perfectly.  In fact, he didn't
              act drunk at all, except when he
              would talk to himself.

                             SKETCH ARTIST
                      (holds up a sketch of
                       Billy)
              How's this?

                             CARRIE
              He didn't have a moustache.  He was
              clean shaven.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY is now clean shaven, driving through the woods.
    Handcuffed to the passenger door is CARRIE DRYER.  BILLY
    is muttering to himself.  He wears sunglasses.


    EXT.  CAR

    As it bumps over train tracks.


    INT.  CAR

    The jostling seems to jar him back to reality.  He turns
    on CARRIE.

                             BILLY
              Take off your pants.

                             CARRIE
              What?

                             BILLY
              Take your fucking pants off!

    She does the best she can with only one hand.

                             BILLY
              You won't run away without any pants
              on.


    EXT.  WOODS

    The car is parked.  BILLY and CARRIE stand beside it --
    she is in a blouse and underwear.

                             BILLY
                      (gently)
              Are you cold?

    She shakes her head "no".  BILLY lays CARRIE'S buckskin
    jacket down on the muddy ground.

                             BILLY
                      (awkwardly, not
                       looking at her)
              Take off your underwear and lay
              down.

    CARRIE dissolves in tears.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    KLEBERG and BOXERBAUM.

                             BOXERBAUM
                      (offers Kleenex)
              It's O.K.  You want to stop for a
              while?

    ANGLE

    A different WOMAN is there, taking the Kleenex to wipe her
    eyes.  It is POLLY NEWTON, a little younger than the other
    two.

                             POLLY
              No.  I'm all right.

                             KLEBERG
              Did he hit you or push you or hurt
              you in any way?

                             POLLY
              No.  He wrote me a poem.

                             BOXERBAUM
              A poem?

                             POLLY
                      (nods)
              A love poem.  He never showed it to
              me because he was afraid you'd trace
              his handwriting.


    EXT.  WOODS

    POLLY lies on the ground, naked from the waist down.
    BILLY crumples up a piece of paper, then slides next to
    her and holds her gently like one would a lover.

                             BILLY
              Do you know what it's like to be
              lonely?  Not to be held by anyone?
              Not to know the meaning of love?

    He looks at her and takes off his sunglasses.  His eyes
    repeatedly drift slowly to one side, then dart back to
    center.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    DONNA WEST and the two cops.

                             DONNA
              It's called nystagmus.  I'm an
              optometry student.  I recognized it
              immediately.  An involuntary
              oscillation of the eyeballs.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    CARRIE DRYER and the two cops.

                             CARRIE
              He never took off his glasses.  I
              don't know.

                             KLEBERG
              Then what happened?

    CARRIE breaks down.

                             CARRIE
              He... raped... me...


    EXT.  WOODS

    BILLY on top of CARRIE.  We don't see much, but it's
    obvious what is going on.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    DONNA WEST staring straight off into space.


    EXT.  WOODS

    BILLY on top of DONNA.  She stares off exactly as she had
    in the police station.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    The FEMALE POLICE OFFICER holding POLLY, who is crying
    uncontrollably.


    EXT.  WOODS

    BILLY holding POLLY tightly after the rape.  They are both
    standing half-dressed.

                             BILLY
              I'm sorry we had to meet under these
              circumstances.  I really love you.

    His eyes drift and dart.  He puts on his sunglasses.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    POLLY NEWTON and the OFFICERS.

                             POLLY
              Then he drove me back into town and
              made me cash him a check at my bank.

                             KLEBERG
                      (to Boxerbaum)
              Same as the others.

                             POLLY
              Then he took me to Wendy's.

                             BOXERBAUM
              Wendy's?

                             POLLY
              For a burger.

    The COPS give each other a look.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    DONNA WEST and the OFFICERS.

                             DONNA
              Then we finally went back to the
              campus and he left.  Oh yeah -- he
              said his name was Phil.

    THREE TRAYS OF MUG SHOTS

    thud down onto the table

    ANGLE

    to include CARRIE DRYER and the OFFICERS.

                             CARRIE
              There's this many criminals around
              here?

                             BOXERBAUM
              That's just the young, white male
              sex offenders.  And only the ones
              who've been arrested.

    CARRIE starts going through the photos.

    POLLY

    going through photos.  She comes to one of BILLY, wearing
    mutton chops.  She stops.  The OFFICERS react.

                             POLLY
              It sure looks like him... but I
              can't be sure.

    DONNA, KLEBERG and BOXERBAUM.

                             DONNA
                      (jumps up, knocking
                       over her chair)
              That's him.  No doubt about it.  I'm
              positive.

    KLEBERG picks it up and WE PRESS IN on a name:

              WILLIAM STANLEY MILLIGAN.


    EXT.  OHIO STATE CAMPUS - NIGHT

    A SERIES OF CUTS

    It looks like an embassy under siege.  Uniformed COPS
    with dogs comb the area.  Armed COPS keep watch from every
    roof top.  Flashlights dart everywhere -- occasionally
    illuminating posters of the police sketch of BILLY on
    campus walls and windows.  In their dorm rooms, frightened
    GIRLS watch from their windows, while below MALE CO-EDS
    travel in packs with baseball bats.  A newspaper vending
    machine shows the Columbus Dispatch headline: CAMPUS
    RAPIST MANHUNT CONTINUES - POLICE URGE CURFEW.


    EXT.  CHANNINGWAY APARTMENTS

    A two story apartment complex.  Three unmarked police cars
    pull up in front.


    INT.  CAR

    BOXERBAUM driving, a young PLAIN CLOTHES OFFICER in the
    passenger seat.

                             BOXERBAUM
              5673 Old Livingston.  That's his
              current address.

    The YOUNG OFFICER checks his weapon, puts it back in the
    waistband of his pants, then puts on a Domino Pizza hat
    and grabs a pizza box from the back seat.


    EXT.  REAR OF BUILDING

    TWO OFFICERS carefully approach the rear of BILLY'S ground
    floor apartment.  One looks in a window.  He can't see
    anyone, but the floor of the living room is covered with
    kids toys: blocks, trucks, etc.  Then we hear voices.  We
    can't make out what they're saying, but It's some kind of
    argument between three men: one with an English accent,
    one with some sort of Eastern European accent, and one
    American mid-west.

                             FIRST OFFICER
              Shit.  He's not alone.


    EXT.  FRONT DOOR

    As the YOUNG OFFICER rings the bell.
    In a moment, BILLY answers the door.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              Pizza.  You Billy Milligan?

                             BILLY
              Who?

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              Billy Milligan?  5673 Old
              Livingston?

                             BILLY
              I'm not Billy Milligan and I didn't
              order any pizza.


    INT.  CAR

    As BOXERBAUM watches from a distance -- his hand on his
    gun.


    EXT.  FRONT DOOR

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              You're sure you're not William
              Stanley Milligan?

                             BILLY
              Huh?

    The YOUNG OFFICER throws the pizza up into BILLY'S face
    and pulls out his gun, holding it against his head.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              Freeze.  Police Officer.

                             BILLY
              What's going on?

    COPS are suddenly everywhere.  Bursting in through the
    back door, piling out of cars, all with guns drawn.


    INT.  REAR OF APARTMENT

    Where the TWO OFFICERS who heard voices are barreling
    through, expecting an ambush.

                             FIRST OFFICER
              He's not alone!

                             SECOND OFFICER
              Alright, motherfuckers, come on out!

    THE YOUNG OFFICER grabs BILLY and turns him around.  Using
    BILLY'S body as a shield, he drags him through the
    apartment, looking for accomplices.

    THE COPS

    kick the closet door, then the bathroom door -- all empty.

    ONE COP

    steps on a LEGGO fort -- crushing it.

    ANOTHER COP

    grabs a Smith and Wesson nine millimeter from under a
    chair in the living room.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              Where are they?

                             BILLY
              Who?  There's no one here.

    A COP

    finds several paintings.  He moves one and reveals the
    picture of the little boy we saw being worked on earlier.
    BOXERBAUM enters frame.  It clicks.  He goes over to BILLY
    and yanks his fingers open.  They're completely paint
    stained.

    ANOTHER COP

    finds wallets, cash and I.D.'s on top of a dresser.  He
    picks up two credit cards and a drivers license belonging
    to Carrie Dryer.  Donna West and Polly Newton,
    respectively.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
                      (as he cuffs Billy)
              William Milligan, you're under
              arrest.  You have the right to
              remain silent...
                      (etc.)

    As we PRESS IN on BILLY.


    EXT.  THE FRANKLIN COUNTY JAIL

    As a police truck pulls up.  TWO GUARDS open the rear
    doors and out steps a group of PRISONERS, all handcuffed
    to each other -- except for BILLY, who pops out free as a
    bird, giving the GUARDS the finger.  The BLACK PRISONER
    who had been cuffed to him is panicked.

                             BLACK PRISONER
              I didn't do nothin' I swear I didn't
              do nothin'

    ONE GUARD holds BILLY while the other re-cuffs him.


    INT.  POLICE STATION

    TV CAMERAS and REPORTERS everywhere, demanding
    information.  POLICE CHIEF KLEBERG makes his way through
    the chaos without answering them.  We FOLLOW him into a
    room where TWO OFFICERS are unloading a carton onto a
    table.  It is filled with every make weapon imaginable.

                             KLEBERG
              Jesus Christ.  It's a fucking
              arsenal.


    INT.  CELL

    BILLY sits in the middle of the floor drawing a picture.
    It's simple, childish.  TWO GUARDS watch him from the
    other side of the bars.  One holds a cup.  The other bangs
    the bars with his nightstick.

                             FIRST GUARD
              Hey, Jew Boy.

                             SECOND GUARD
              What do you know -- we have a
              goddamn Rembrandt on our hands.

                             FIRST GUARD
              Maybe he can draw himself a new
              asshole after the cons at Lima get
              through humpin' the one he's got.
              They don't look too kindly on
              rapists over there.

                             SECOND GUARD
              They sent you down some Kool-Aid.
              You want it?

    BILLY looks up.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Is that a no?

    The GUARD starts to turn away, but BILLY gets up.  He
    comes to the bars and reaches for the cup.  The GUARD
    grabs his wrist and pulls.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Hey, you think we oughta tattoo this
              Jew Boy?

                             FIRST GUARD
              Yeah.  Put some numbers right there.

    BILLY pulls his arm free as the GUARDS laugh.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Here ya go, Rembrandt.

    He throws the drink onto BILLY'S picture, ruining it.

    Instantly, BILLY changes.  His eyes, his gait.  His chest
    expands and his adrenaline flows a mile a minute as he
    gets up and walks over to the toilet bowl.  He squats and
    grabs hold of it.  The GUARDS give each other a look, then
    eye him warily.  Sweat pours down as he focuses his
    strength till it's like the pinpoint of a laser.  Then,
    with a mighty heave he rips the toilet from the wall,
    stands and hurls it at the GUARDS in one impossible
    motion.  It smashes into a million pieces -- porcelain
    shards fly into the GUARD'S faces, cutting them to
    ribbons.


    INT.  CELL

    BILLY being beaten senseless by SIX GUARDS as they put him
    into a straitjacket.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    BILLY is nearly unconscious as the GUARDS drag him down
    the narrow hallway -- laying into him the entire way.


    INT.  SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

    They throw BILLY in.  His head hits the cement hard as the
    cell door slams shut behind him with a thunderous echo.


    INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE

    KLEBERG in front of a phalanx of microphones, reading a
    statement.

                             KLEBERG
              We do have a suspect in custody.
              His name is William Stanley
              Milligan.  He has one prior
              conviction from a run-in with a
              prostitute.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    A GUARD carries a tray of food toward BILLY'S cell.

                             KLEBERG (V.O.)
              We continue to treat this
              investigation very carefully and
              very thoroughly but with the
              evidence we've already gathered, we
              feel extremely confident.

    The GUARD reaches the cell door.  As he opens it.

                             GUARD
              O.K., rapist, chow time.  We all
              took turns spitting in your food
              before I brought it down, but you
              can ignore that, can't ya?  Just
              pretend it's soup...

    His eyes suddenly go wide.

                             GUARD
              Jesus H. Christ.

    ANGLE

    BILLY is fast asleep in the middle of his cell.  He is out
    of the straitjacket and is using it as a pillow.  And he's
    sucking his thumb.


    INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE

                             KLEBERG
              Open and shut.  A textbook
              investigation.


    INT.  A DRAB WHITE ROOM

    DR. ADAM FINK, a clinical psychologist, sits across a
    table from BILLY.

    TIGHT ON A PAGE OF NOTES

    At the top of the page, beside BILLY'S vital statistics,
    DR. FINK fills in his name.  Underneath, he writes:
    PRELIMINARY REPORT.

    ANGLE

    on them both, DR. FINK just watches for a moment.  BILLY
    is withdrawn and out of it, like a boxer who's taken one
    too many left hooks.  There's a wall between him and the
    world.

                             DR. FINK
              Do you know why you're here, Billy?

    No response.

    TIGHT ON THE FORM

    Under COMMENTS, the DOCTOR writes: eyes completely normal.
    No evidence of nystagmus.

    ANGLE

                             DR. FINK
              Billy?

                             BILLY
                      (snaps back slightly)
              Oh.

                             DR. FINK
              Do you know why you're here?

                             BILLY
              No.

                             DR. FINK
              Did you understand what the police
              officers said when you were
              arrested?

                             BILLY
              The... what?

                             DR. FINK
              Do you know why you've been
              arrested?  Billy?

    He just stares blankly.  DR. FINK writes.

    TIGHT ON THE NOTES

    DR. FINK is adding: SULLEN; NON-COMMUNICATIVE; TOTALLY
    DISORIENTED.

    BILLY

    suddenly energetic, even hyper -- night and day to the way
    we've just seen him.

                             BILLY
                      (laughing)
              You should have seen their fuckin'
              faces when them van doors opened and
              BOOM!.  There I am, out of the cuffs
              and givin' them the finger.  Shit...
              Whassamatter, Doc, not actin' crazy
              enough for ya?  How's this?

    He rubs his lips up and down with his finger and makes a
    "crazy" sound.  As he does:

    ANGLE

    to reveal he's talking to DR. RICHARD EDMUNDS, in the same
    room, some time later.  EDMUNDS holds DR. FINK'S report
    and is completely confused.  BILLY laughs.  Then:

                             BILLY
              Who do you have to fuck to get
              somethin' to eat around here?  I'm
              starving.  And a lawyer might be
              nice.  What do you say?

    TIGHT AS BILLY CONTINUES

    Next to DR. FINK'S report, we see DR. EDMUNDS' hand fill
    in his own report.  He's already put down his name,
    BILLY'S name and underneath written: FOLLOW UP REPORT.
    Now we see him writing: OUTGOING, OBNOXIOUS, TOTALLY
    COHERENT AND AWARE.  EYES NORMAL.

                             BILLY
              The novelty's wearin' thin, you know
              what I mean?  I been in places worse
              than this in my life, and I'll tell
              you something... there isn't a box
              on Earth can hold me.  Certainly not
              this two bit, rinky dink drunk tank.

                             DR. EDMUNDS
              I'd like to talk to you about the
              attacks.

                             BILLY
              Hey, I wasn't there.  I don't know
              what they're talkin' about because I
              didn't do a fuckin' thing they
              accused me of.  And I don't lie.

    Using his right hand.  BILLY starts doodling a sketch of a
    landscape on the table with a marker.  EDMUNDS looks at
    him quizzically.

                             DR. EDMUNDS
              I want to play a little game.  Write
              down the first thing that comes into
              your mind.

    He moves a pen and a piece of paper toward BILLY, who
    writes with his right hand.  EDMUNDS looks at the
    information on his form.

    TIGHT ON THE REPORT

    Scan down BILLY'S listed vital statistics -- Hair: Brown;
    Eyes: Brown; Height: six feet; Weight: 175; Birthdate: 2-
    14-55; etc. until he gets to: Left Handed.

    BACK TO BILLY - FINISHING

    He hands back the paper.  It says: I AM INNOCENT.

    TIGHT ON THE PREVIOUS TWO REPORTS

    On DR. EDMUNDS, "Left Handed" has been crossed out and
    "Right Handed" written in.  Next to them is a third form,
    with the NAME: DR. CLAIRE HUBBARD and SUPERVISOR'S REPORT
    written underneath.

    ANGLE

    The same room.  DR. HUBBARD, hopelessly confused, and
    BILLY, who now appears to be a frightened child.  Fragile.
    Near tears.  Knees drawn up into a fetal position in the
    chair.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Are you alright?  You look like
              you're about to fall apart.

                             BILL
              I'm scared.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              There's nothing to be scared of.
              I'm Dr. Hubbard from the Southwest
              Community Mental Health Center and
              I'm here to ask you a few questions.
              Where are you currently living?

                             BILLY
              Here.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              What's your Social Security number?

                             BILLY
              I don't know.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Is it 126-44-6218?

                             BILLY
              I don't know.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Billy, if I'm going to help you,
              you're going to have to try and...

                             BILLY
              Billy's asleep.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              What?

                             BILLY
              Billy's asleep.  And the others
              don't want me to wake him up.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              What others?

                             BILLY
              The other people.  They want Billy
              to stay asleep.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Who are these other people?

                             BILLY
              I can't talk about it.  I made a
              mistake telling you.  Promise you
              won't say anything to anyone.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              I promise.  But you have to tell
              me...

                             BILLY
                      (upset)
              I can't...

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Alright, you don't have to say
              anything else, but would you do me a
              favor?

                             BILLY
              What?

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Would you sign your name for me?

                             BILLY
              O.K.

    She gives him a pen and paper.  He takes it into his left
    hand and scrawls in a child's penmanship: DANNY.


    INT.  HALL OUTSIDE OF SAME DRAB WHITE ROOM

    Through the door, we see BILLY, alone, waiting.  Outside,
    DR. HUBBARD and JUDY STEVENSON, a public defense
    attorney, are talking.

                             JUDY
              Multiple personality disorder?  You
              mean like Sybil?

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Worse -- if one of the personalities
              is a violent criminal.

                             JUDY
              With all respect, Doctor, if you
              were a rapist, caught dead to rights
              with a ton of evidence in your
              apartment, wouldn't you try and make
              up a story, too?  Trust me, this is
              a guy who read a bestseller and got
              a brainstorm.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Maybe, but I don't think so.  He's
              already been seen by three separate
              doctors because no one could make
              head of tails of him.

                             JUDY
              Well, I thought I'd seen it all, but
              I have to admit "I didn't do it, he
              did" "No I didn't" "Yes he did" --
              that's a new one even to me.

                             DR. HUBBARD
              Just come in and talk to him with
              me -- then decide.

                             JUDY
              We'll represent him no matter what.
              We have to.  But fine--
                      (as they go in)
              I only have a caseload that high
              sitting on my desk while I waste a
              whole afternoon here...


    INT.  GARY SCHWEICKART'S PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICE

    The first thing we hear is reggae music: Bob Marley's
    "Jammin", with a male voice that can't really sing,
    singing along.  Then we PAN along the office -- a royal
    mess -- books, papers everywhere -- a poster of the BILL
    OF RIGHTS with "NULL AND VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW"
    stamped across it in red letters.  We finally come to a
    big, bear-like figure in an ex-hippie's khaki shirt and
    jeans -- late thirties, with a beard and an oversized
    stogie, skankin' around the office.  This is GARY
    SCHWEICKART.

                             GARY
                      (in a Jamaican
                       accent)
              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my
              client, Jah Skank Irie, is innocent.
              For it is not the ganja weed that is
              on trial here today, only the man...
              mon.

    JUDY burst in.

                             JUDY
              Gary, put down what you're doing and
              get your ass down to Franklin with
              me.

                             GARY
                      (Jamaican accent)
              Whoa -- don't get your knickers in a
              twist -- you'll give yourself one of
              them aneurisms.

                             JUDY
              I'm serious, Gary.  I think you
              should see this.

    She dumps her notes on his desk.

                             GARY
                      (drops the accent)
              Billy Milligan?

                             JUDY
              Yes.

                             GARY
              Uh uh.  Sorry, Judy, one of the
              perks of getting to be the boss is
              you don't have to give up all your
              free time representing the Campus
              Rapist if you don't want to.  And I
              don't want to.  Besides, I already
              met him before I ordered the
              psychiatric evaluation, and he
              specifically asked for a female
              lawyer.

                             JUDY
                      (smiles, she knows
                       he's  gonna like
                       this)
              He's not guilty.

                             GARY
                      (he does, his eyes
                       twinkle, he loves a
                       challenge)
              Not guilty?  They got enough hard
              evidence to lock him up till
              doomsday.

                             JUDY
                      (leans in)
              I'm telling you, Billy Milligan did
              not commit those rapes.  At least
              come down and talk to him.

    A beat.  GARY leaps up, grabs his beret to leave.


    INT.  THAT SAME DRAB WHITE ROOM

    JUDY, GARY and BILLY.  BILLY has withdrawn completely into
    himself -- eyes half-closed, his lips moving in some
    internal conversation.  JUDY looks at GARY, who just sits
    there -- skeptical and impassive.  Finally, BILLY opens
    his eyes and is suddenly infused with the same belligerent
    energy he had while talking to DR. EDMUNDS.

                             BILLY
                      (to Judy)
              Who's Ranger Bob?

                             JUDY
              This is Gary Schweickart.  He works
              with me in the Public Defenders
              office.

                             BILLY
              Howdy, Bob.

    GARY smiles tightly.  He doesn't like him right off.

                             JUDY
              You don't remember meeting him
              briefly when you first came in?

                             BILLY
                      (shakes his head)
              That's not a face you forget.

                             JUDY
              I know that you requested a female
              attorney, but Gary's the most
              qualified...

                             BILLY
              I didn't request nothin'

                             JUDY
              Well, Billy did.

                             BILLY
              Billy's asleep.

                             GARY
                      (getting annoyed)
              Well, someone did.

                             BILLY
                      (imitates Gary)
              Well, someone ain't me.

                             JUDY
              Who are you?

                             BILLY
              Tommy.

                             JUDY
              And have we met before?

                             BILLY
              Yeah.  You came in with one of the
              headshrinkers.

                             JUDY
              And at that time you answered to the
              name Billy?

                             BILLY
              We all do.  Saves time.  But that
              don't mean we like it.

                             GARY
              Alright... Tommy... we'd like to ask
              you a few questions.  How old are
              you?

                             BILLY
              Sixteen.

                             GARY
              How much time do you spend as Billy?
              Were you there when he got out of
              the straitjacket?

                             BILLY
                      (laughs)
              Yeah, that was me.  Billy couldn't
              get out of a wet paper bag.  I can
              dislocate my shoulder to slip it
              down to where I can loosen the ties.

                             GARY
              Where'd you learn to do that?

    BILLY looks away.

                             JUDY
              Tommy?

                             BILLY
              You got somethin' else you wanna
              know or can I leave?

                             JUDY
              No.  Please.  How many of you live
              there with Billy?

    BILLY smiles.

                             JUDY
              More than three?  More than five?

                             BILLY
              I'm not really sure.  A lot.

                             GARY
              Were you there when... whoever you
              were at the time was arrested?

                             BILLY
              No.  That was Danny.

                             JUDY
              The little boy.

                             BILLY
              Danny's the keeper of pain.

                             GARY
              What does that mean?

                             BILLY
              College man, Bob?  Ivy League?

    GARY steams.

                             BILLY
              It means whenever Billy's in any
              pain, Danny comes onto the spot to
              take it.

                             JUDY
              The spot?  What's that?

                             BILLY
              Jesus Christ... it's not my job to
              answer all these questions.  I'm
              outta here.

                             JUDY
              No, wait... Tommy...

    But BILLY has retreated into himself once again.  Eyes
    glazed and half-closed -- lips moving silently.

                             GARY
              This is what you dragged me here for
              in the middle of the day?

                             JUDY
              Wait.

    In a moment, BILLY "returns" -- but now he sits with
    impeccable posture, his fingertips pressed together in
    front of him.  He speaks in clipped, precise tones with a
    perfect Knightsbridge English accent.

                             BILLY
              I must apologize for Tommy's
              impudence.  He gets frustrated from
              being locked up.  My name is Arthur.
              How do you do?

    JUDY and GARY exchange a look.  He ain't buying it.

                             JUDY
              How do you do?

    JUDY looks again at GARY, who half rolls his eyes.

                             GARY
                      (mutters)
              Yeah, how are ya...

                             BILLY
              Well, understandably, I've been
              better.  But Tommy said you have
              some questions.

                             JUDY
              Yes.  Gary was asking about the
              arrest.

                             GARY
              The police found an arsenal of
              weapons in your apartment.

                             BILLY
              I have nothing to do with those.
              The only one permitted to handle
              guns is Ragen.  He's the Keeper of
              Rage.

                             GARY
              He used those guns when he kidnapped
              and raped those three women.

                             BILLY
                      (icily calm)
              Ragen never raped anyone.  He
              committed the robberies because we
              were skint, but he denies,
              absolutely, having anything to do
              sexually with those women.  And of
              the many things he undoubtedly is, a
              liar is not among them.  All our
              lives people have accused us of
              being liars.  It's become a point of
              honor never to tell a falsehood.

                             JUDY
              But if you don't always volunteer
              the truth, then that's lying by
              omission.

                             BILLY
              Oh come now.  As an attorney, you
              know very well a witness is under
              no compulsion to volunteer
              information he hasn't been asked
              for.  You would be the first one to
              tell a client not to elaborate
              unless it was in his best interest.
              But why don't you meet Ragen and ask
              him yourself?

                             JUDY
              Isn't Ragen the one who pulled the
              toilet from the wall and threw it at
              the guards?

                             BILLY
              He's learned to control his flow of
              adrenaline.  It gives him unnatural
              strength.
                      (playfully)
              But don't worry -- he won't hurt you.
              Unless, of course, he feels
              threatened.

                             GARY
              Alright... Arthur -- I'd like to
              meet him.

    BILLY smiles -- then gets up and moves his chair to the
    far side of the room -- putting as much distance between
    himself and them as possible.  He sites back down and then
    retreats once more.  Eyes look down -- lips move.

                             GARY
              How much education has he had?

                             JUDY
              Not much.  Some high school.  D
              average.  I.Q.'s a hundred.  He
              paints, though.

                             GARY
              Paints?

                             JUDY
              Portraits, landscapes.  He's good.

    Then, BILLY'S back.  He seems bigger -- hulking --
    crouched like a wary fighter.  The tension in his facial
    muscles change his appearance.  His eyes squint narrowly,
    giving them a piercing quality -- his brow beetles.  And
    he speaks in a thick, Slavic accent.

                             BILLY
              Who called me a liar?

                             GARY
                      (a little unnerved)
              I said the evidence indicated that
              someone in there raped those three
              woman.

                             BILLY
              I admit three robberies near
              university.  But other things you
              say I do is a lie.  And if we go to
              jail, I'll kill the children.  Jail
              is no place for little ones.

                             JUDY
              What little ones?  There are
              children there with you?

                             GARY
              If you killed the little ones...
              wouldn't that also mean your own
              death?

                             BILLY
                      (coolly)
              We are all different people.

                             GARY
              But when you get hurt...

                             BILLY
              I feel nothing.

                             JUDY
              Because Danny is the Keeper of Pain?

                             BILLY
              Exactly.  Danny is empath.

                             JUDY
              And Billy knows nothing about you?

                             BILLY
              He has amnesia.  Arthur and I keep
              him asleep to protect him.
              Depending on circumstances, either I
              rule or Arthur does.  In prison, I
              control spot because is dangerous
              place.  As protector, I have complete
              command.  In situations where is no
              danger, and where intelligence and
              logic are more important, then
              Arthur controls spot.

                             GARY
              Do you know Tommy?

                             BILLY
              Of course.

                             GARY
              He mentioned the spot, too.  Can you
              describe to us just what that means.
              Billy?... Uh...
                      (he looks to Judy
                       for help)

                             JUDY
              Ragen.

                             GARY
              Ragen.

    But suddenly, RAGEN is gone.  JUDY and GARY look at each
    other.  There is none of the usual lips moving and quasi
    R.E.M. state.  He's just blank.  Then, in a moment, he
    "returns".  He seems tentative, frightened, softer.

                             JUDY
              Hello.

    No reply.

                             JUDY
              Have we met?  My name is Judy
              Stevenson.  This is Gary
              Schweickart.  We're your attorneys.
              Do you have a name?

                             GARY
              Judy.

    She looks at GARY.

                             GARY
              His eyes.

    She looks back to BILLY.  His eyes seem to wander and dart
    back and forth of their own volition, like an ocular
    pendulum.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    As GARY and JUDY come out.  GARY immediately lights a
    cigarette.

                             GARY
              Either he's a multiple, or else he's
              the greatest liar anybody's ever
              seen.

                             JUDY
              Right.

                             GARY
              The question is which is it?

                             JUDY
                      (convinced)
              Gary...

    As they talk, WE CUT TO:

    BILLY alone in his empty cell, eyes half-closed, lips
    moving silently.

                             GARY (O.C.)
              He's facing hard time.

                             JUDY (O.C.)
              He's got one right handed
              personality.

                             GARY (O.C.)
              Lots of people are ambidextrous.

                             JUDY (O.C.)
              Ragen speaks and writes prefect
              Serbo-Croation.

                             GARY (O.C.)
              So do ten million Serbs.

                             JUDY (O.C.)
              Apparently, Arthur's fluent in
              Arabic and Swahili.

                             GARY (O.C.)
              Having a facility for languages
              doesn't automatically make you one
              hand short for bridge.

                             JUDY (O.C.)
              The escape artist, the wandering
              eyes, the electronics expert...

    GARY and JUDY.

                             GARY
              All of that can be mastered.

                             JUDY
              All by one person?  With a hundred
              I.Q.?  From a small farm in Ohio?
              You're looking for some kind of
              miraculous, inexplicable "thing" to
              prove this to you beyond a shadow of
              a doubt.  Well, it's an illness,
              Gary... not a magic trick.  And I
              believe him.

                             GARY
                      (sighs heavily)
              I do, too.  And I feel like I can
              convince my wife of it when she asks
              me why I came down here for fifteen
              minutes, and came back five hours
              later.  But how in hell am I ever
              gonna convince a judge?  Or a
              prosecutor?  No one's ever been
              acquitted of a crime before by
              blaming it on another personality.

                             JUDY
              You won't have to.  He will.


    INT.  ISOLATION CELL

    BILLY sits on his cot in a cold sweat.  Something is
    clearly terrifying him.  He looks across the cell toward a
    piece of steel over the sink shiny enough to serve as a
    mirror.  He is frozen.


    INT.  OUTSIDE THE ISOLATION CELL

    It's a big, opaque, steel door with a small opening two
    thirds up in the middle.  A GUARD approaches with keys.
    There's a loud rumbling coming from inside.

                             GUARD
              Alright, Milligan.  Exercise time.

    As he turns the key:

                             GUARD
              One hour in the yard, all to
              yourself.

    As he opens the door:

                             GUARD
              Come on... Milligan...

    Now we see BILLY lying in a pool of blood on the floor.
    The sink is smashed into a million pieces and his wrists
    have been slashed lengthwise with a shard of porcelain.
    Hot water shoots from the blood-stained sink like a
    firehose gone haywire.  He meant business.  He's fainted
    and landed on his own arm, which is saving his life.  The
    GUARD runs in.

                             GUARD
              Help!  We got an emergency!  Quick!


    INT.  HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT

    BILLY lies in bed, staring off blankly, while GARY and
    JUDY talk to him.

                             GARY
              How ya feelin', Billy?  You were out
              for quite some time.

                             JUDY
              Do you know where you are?  You're
              in the hospital, but you're gonna be
              just fine.  Your hearing is going to
              go ahead as scheduled.

                             GARY
              Well, why don't you get some rest.
              We'll check in with you tomorrow.

                             JUDY
              Goodnight, Billy.

    He remains motionless.  They leave and we follow them into
    the hall.

                             JUDY
              What do you think?

                             GARY
              I don't know.  But there were no
              hammers or crowbars in that cell
              with him.  He broke that sink with
              his bare fist.


    INT.  HEARING ROOM

    MEMBERS OF THE ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY, JUDY, BILLY and A
    PROSECUTOR, along with a COURT STENOGRAPHER and TWO POLICE
    OFFICERS.  BILLY'S wrists are bandaged.  GARY enters,
    obviously agitated.

                             JUDY
                      (to Gary)
              What's wrong?

                             GARY
              I just found out they're gonna try
              and send him to jail for a parole
              violation and keep him there till
              the trial.  We need him in a
              hospital with doctors for those
              ninety days to build a case.

                             JUDY
              Parole violation?

                             GARY
              But there's a statute of limitations
              and this is the last day they can
              nail him on it.

                             JUDY
              What are you gonna do?

                             GARY
              Wing it.

                             CHAIRMAN
                      (nods to the
                       Prosecutor)
              Mr. Yavitch?  Shall we begin?

                             PROSECUTOR
              Mr. Chairman, members of the Adult
              Parole Authority, the state moves
              that possession of an unregistered
              firearm is a direct violation of the
              defendant's parole, and he should
              therefore be remanded to Lebanon
              State Prison until trial date.

                             GARY
              Objection, Mr. Chairman.

                             MR. CHAIRMAN
              Mr. Schweickart -- don't you own a
              tie?

                             GARY
                      (disheveled as
                       usual)
              I do, your honor, but I like to save
              it for funerals.

                             CHAIRMAN
              What is your objection?

                             GARY
              Are these the weapons that were
              found in the defendant's home?

                             PROSECUTOR
              Mr. Chairman, Mr. Schweickart knows
              damn well that they are.

                             GARY
              Mr. Chairman, Mr. Schweickart does
              not know damn well that they are
              because Mr. Schweickart has yet to
              see any ballistics report.

                             PROSECUTOR
              The weapons have not been test fired
              yet, you honor, so the report has
              not been completed.  But I fail to
              see in what way that is prescient to
              the decision at hand.

                             GARY
                      (winging it)
              It is "prescient" counsel, because
              without any proof of it's ability to
              propel a ballistic, this... "thing"
              is not a gun, your honor.

                             PROSECUTOR
              Oh come on, Schweickart, of course
              it's a gun.
                      (to the Chairman)
              It's a gun.  Obviously it's a gun.

    GARY grabs it and holds it to his head.

                             JUDGE
              Mr. Schweickart...

    JUDY and BILLY duck -- the PROSECUTOR finches -- but GARY
    pulls the trigger.  It's unloaded.

                             GARY
              Legally, until it shoots a bullet
              it's as much a gun as it is a
              zucchini.  And having zucchinis
              found in your apartment is not a
              violation of Mr. Milligan's or
              anybody else's parole.  Mr.
              Chairman, gentlemen, since the
              statute of limitations of Mr.
              Milligan's alleged parole violation
              is up today.  I move that the
              defendant be allowed to stay at
              Harding Hospital, under the
              supervision of a trained psychiatric
              staff until it is time for him to
              stand trial.

                             PROSECUTOR
              Mr. Chairman...

    The CHAIRMAN raps his gavel.

                             CHAIRMAN
              So be it.  Next time get your shit
              together, counsel.

    Shakes his head, chuckling.

                             CHAIRMAN
              Zucchinis...


    EXT.  HARDING HOSPITAL - DAY

    BILLY is escorted from a police car by TWO UNIFORMED
    OFFICERS.  He is handcuffed.


    INT.  HARDING HOSPITAL

    An admitting nurse signs a release form, accepting
    delivery of BILLY with a big ORDERLY.

                             NURSE
              Take those off him.

                             FIRST OFFICER
              Not while he's still ours.

    She finishes, they uncuff him.  To the nurse:

                             FIRST OFFICER
              Can I give you a little advice?
              Keep him away from the toilets.  Let
              him piss in a bucket.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    BILLY, the NURSE and the ORDERLY walking down the hall.

                             NURSE
              Doctor Harding's not here right now,
              but he'll look in on you as soon as
              he arrives.

    As they walk, they pass people who are obviously deeply
    disturbed, as well as TWO FEMALE PSYCH-TECHS.

                             FIRST PSYCH-TECH
                      (after they've
                       passed)
              I'm not gonna stand for it.

                             SECOND PSYCH-TECH
              Jean...

                             FIRST PSYCH-TECH
              It's a con.  It's a lousy con.  And
              I'm not gonna treat him.


    INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

    BILLY is alone.  He looks at the door.  An eye is watching
    him through the peephole.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    A PSYCH-TECH sits on a stool, watching him and taking
    notes.

    THE NOTES:

              5:00 Sitting cross legged on bed, quiet.
              5:15 Sitting cross legged on bed, staring.
              5:32 Standing, looking out the window.


    INT.  DAY ROOM - DAY

    BILLY sits, alone and sullen, while other PATIENTS either
    smoke, play cards or stare into space.  Another YOUNG MALE
    PATIENT sits next to him.  He's got a tin of peanut
    brittle.

                             PATIENT
              Want some?  My folks bring it.  Your
              folks come visit you?

                             BILLY
              My folks are divorced.  Leave me
              alone.

                             PATIENT
              What's your name?  Come on, what's
              your name?

                             BILLY
              Allen.

                             PATIENT
                      (sympathetic)
              Only they call you Billy, right?
              But that's not your name, is it?  I
              understand.

                             BILLY
                      (softening)
              You do?

                             PATIENT
              They do that all the time here.
                      (offers his hand)
              Natalie Wood.  How do you do?

    BILLY shakes it.


    INT.  EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

    At Harding Hospital.  BILLY attached to an EEG, while a
    TECHNICIAN looks at the results.  He's obviously confused.

    TIGHT

    on the print out.


    INT.  OFFICE - DAY

    At Harding.  The TECHNICIAN is showing the printout to a
    DOCTOR.

                             DOCTOR
              It's got to be a mistake.  A glitch
              in the machine.

                             TECHNICIAN
              I've never had a problem before.

                             DOCTOR
              Well, what do you want me to say?
              Adults do not emit spiked Theta
              waves on their EEG's.  Only children
              do.  Try changing the electrode.


    INT.  EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

    The TWO DOCTORS are administering another EEG to BILLY.
    They seem satisfied with the results this time.

                             DOCTOR
              See?  Completely normal.  Those
              electrodes are for shit.

                             TECHNICIAN
              But I didn't change the electrode.
              I had to order it.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    DOCTOR HARDING approaches BILLY'S peephole and peers in.
    Beside him is the ADMITTING NURSE.


    INT.  ROOM

    BILLY is on the floor, drawing.  He's made a very
    disturbing picture of a tombstone that's inscribed: DO NOT
    R.I.P.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

                             NURSE
              I think he's looking forward to
              meeting you, Doctor.

                             DR. HARDING
                      (gulps a little)
              I'll see him in my office.  Lots of
              coffee, please.

    He heads off down the hall.


    INT.  OUTSIDE HARDING'S OFFICE

    BILLY is dropped off by an ORDERLY.

                             HARDING
                      (rises to greet him)
              Ah, Billy, come on in.  Sit down.
              Coffee?

    The ORDERLY leaves, closing the door and shutting us out.


    INT.  HEARING ROOM

    It's small and sterile.  The JUDGE, PROSECUTOR,
    STENOGRAPHER, DR. HARDING, GARY, JUDY and BILLY are
    present.

                             HARDING
              Your honor, based on my interviews
              with the defendant, it is my opinion
              that, William S. Milligan suffers
              from Multiple Personality Disorder
              and has fragmented into ten separate
              personality manifestations.  At the
              time of the acts in question, I
              believe he was mentally ill and
              unable to distinguish between right
              and wrong.  Further, he did not have
              the ability to refrain from
              committing these acts.  These
              findings are consistent with a plea
              of not guilty by reason of insanity,
              and I would, therefore, recommend
              that he be remanded to Athens State
              Hospital for suitable treatment.

                             JUDGE
              Mr. Yavitch, do you contest these
              findings?

                             PROSECUTOR
              No, your honor.  The prosecution
              does not.

                             JUDGE
              Then, lacking any evidence to the
              contrary, this court has no
              alternative than to find the
              defendant not guilty by reason of
              insanity.

    He raps his gavel three times.


    EXT.  COURTHOUSE

    BILLY is led, handcuffed, by TWO POLICEMEN, out a back
    entrance, but they still collide with a handful of
    REPORTERS.

                             REPORTER
              How do you feel now that you've been
              found not guilty?

                             BILLY
              I feel better now that it's all over
              with and I finally have come back to
              a reality that I've missed for so
              long.

                             SECOND REPORTER
              Do you have any recollection of the
              crimes your other personalities have
              been charged with?

                             BILLY
              Very little.  Certain things come to
              me in forms of dreams that you could
              call memories, but I can't really
              distinct between memories -- the
              realities...

                             REPORTER
                      (aside to another
                       Reporter)
              Yeah, right.  And I'm Doris Day.

                             BILLY
              ... because my emotions split so far
              apart -- love, hate and fear...

                             SECOND REPORTER
              Billy, what do you want to do with
              your life?

                             BILLY
              Become a citizen again.

    The COPS lead him away.


    INT.  POLICE CAR

    BILLY sits in back, flanked by the TWO POLICEMEN.  It's
    freezing cold.  They're bundled up -- BILLY wears just a
    suit.  One POLICEMAN drinks hot coffee.

                             FIRST POLICEMAN
              Well, you got away with it, didn't
              ya?  You must be pretty proud of
              yourself.

    BILLY shivers silently.

                             FIRST POLICEMAN
              You turn my stomach.  I've got two
              daughters.  Come on, you can tell
              me -- you're fakin', right?

                             SECOND POLICEMAN
              Ray...
                      (to Billy)
              You look cold.  You want some hot
              coffee?  Here.

    The SECOND POLICEMAN, who wears thick gloves, purposely
    shoves the cup at BILLY'S handcuffed hands so that the
    coffee spills all over his lap, scalding him.  The
    POLICEMEN laugh.

    Out the window, BILLY realizes they're passing by a turn
    off on the road marked by a covered bridge.  He gets
    upset.

    WE PRESS IN on BILLY.  Then:

    TYMPANI ROLL


    INT.  THE SHOWROOM AT THE EDEN ROC HOTEL IN MIAMI BEACH

    It's 1958, and filled with middle aged JEWISH COUPLES out
    for the resort's Saturday night entertainment.  The MEN
    are in suits and the WOMEN are dressed to the teeth --
    falls attached to over-teased hair, false eyelashes and
    stiff, heavy gowns.  Minks draped over chairbacks.
    Spotlights roam the stage and the audience.

                             ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
              Ladies and gentlemen.  The Eden Roc
              Hotel welcomes you to the Grand
              Ballroom.  Have we got a show for
              you tonight!

    PRESS IN on BILLY, AGE THREE.

    He's in a suit and bowtie, on a stool next to the kitchen
    entrance, watching the stage in rapt fascination.  WAITERS
    and BUSBOYS rush past him loaded down with trays full of
    drinks.

                             ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
              Claire and Myrna -- the Barry
              Sisters...
                      (applause)
              The dancing stylings of Tanya and
              Briaggi...
                      (applause)
              And now, please welcome the adults
              only comedy of Johnny Morrison.

    THE STAGE

    Over applause, the band plays JOHNNY'S lead-in music.  He
    bounds on stage, all sweat and smiles -- his old shirt
    collar too tight for his extra chin.  But the spotlights
    keep roaming -- leaving him in the dark.  He gives a "can
    you believe this shit?" face and the audience reluctantly
    plays along.  This is the oldest shtick in the book.  Once
    again, the band plays his little intro.  Once again the
    audience applauds -- but less than before.  And this time,
    instead of the spots landing on him at the music cut-off,
    they focus on an empty spot across the stage.  Scattered
    laughter.  More groans.

    BILLY

    laughing hard.

    THE STAGE

                             JOHNNY
              Now you know why it's cheaper here
              than the Fountainbleu.

    Nothing.  No response.  Just chairs scuffling and forks on
    dessert plates.

    INTERCUT

    Between BILLY and the SPOTLIGHT, as JOHNNY continues with
    his act.  BILLY is fascinated by it: it's sharp, defined
    glow, lighting up just one perfect circle while all around
    it is darkness.

                             JOHNNY
              Two women at the Fountainbleu are
              looking through a hole in the wall
              into the men's steam room.  They
              see one poor shnook, naked as a
              jaybird with a towel over his face.
              The first woman says: "Ciel... would
              you look at that?  He's not Jewish."
              The other woman says "Jewish?  He's
              not even a guest here."

    Rimshot.

    THE STAGE

                             JOHNNY
                      (flop sweat now)
              Alright, already.

    He whistles at the spot through his two fingers and
    motions it towards him.  It moves maybe a foot in his
    direction.  He commits the comic's cardinal sin -- he
    laughs when the audience doesn't.  He's the joke now.

    BILLY

    oblivious.  Laughing -- deliriously happy.  Suddenly, a
    BUSBOY with a tray full of glasses bangs into him and
    everything smashes to the ground.

                             BUSBOY
                      (cleaning)
              Goddammit!

                             BILLY
              I'm sorry.

                             BUSBOY
              Get out of the goddamn aisle.  I
              been just missin' you all night.

                             BILLY
              I couldn't see before.

                             BUSBOY
              Well, that's too bad -- what the
              hell are you doin' in here all
              alone, anyway?

                             BILLY
                      (points to Johnny)
              That's my Daddy.

                             BUSBOY
              Yeah?  Well, he stinks.  That steam
              room joke is as old as my Aunt
              Bessie's ass.

    He goes to lift BILLY off the stool.

                             BUSBOY
              Now sit someplace else, before I
              have you thrown out.

                             BILLY
              No!

    TWO BIG HANDS -- more like paws -- enter frame and lift
    the BUSBOY off the ground.  They belong to a second
    BUSBOY, huge and mustachioed.  He speaks with a thick
    Slavic accent.

                             SECOND BUSBOY
              Leave him alone.

                             BUSBOY
                      (scared)
              Hey, buddy, I was only...

                             SECOND BUSBOY
              Just leave him alone.

    He tosses the FIRST BUSBOY aside like a piece of crumpled
    up paper and gives his attention to BILLY.

                             BILLY
              I couldn't see before.  That's my
              Daddy.

    He lifts BILLY up onto his shoulders.

                             SECOND BUSBOY
              There.  Now you see everything.

    THE STAGE

    as JOHNNY finally walks over to the spot and steps inside
    it.  A couple of people applaud.

    BILLY

    on the BUSBOY'S shoulders -- eyes glued to his FATHER --
    all lit up against the blackness.


    INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

    BILLY'S MOTHER, DOROTHY, is coming, watching a soap opera
    and talking on the phone all at the same time.  BILLY,
    still three, has a toy ambulance that he's running all
    over with -- rolling it over everything, making siren
    noises, "vrooming" at the top of his lungs.  Finally:

                             DOROTHY
              Billy, please -- can't you see I'm
              tryin' to watch the TV?  Now take
              that someplace else.

    He takes the car down the hall -- vrooming slightly
    quieter.  WE HOLD on a framed photo of JOHNNY MORRISON and
    JIMMY DURANTE.  Baby BILLY sits on DURANTE'S knee.

    BILLY

    arrives at a door leading to the garage.  He opens it and
    immediately starts coughing.  It's filled with fumes.  He
    looks inside the car, which is running, and sees his
    FATHER, slumped over on the front seat.


    INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

    It's filled with people, all in black, all eating.  BILLY
    is in a black suit and bowtie, getting underneath
    everybody's feet, still carrying his ambulance.  He vrooms
    very quietly.  He looks over at his MOTHER, red-eyed from
    crying, on a sofa with another WOMAN.  DOROTHY breaks
    down.

                             DOROTHY
              My God, he looks just like him.  I
              can't look at him.  I can't...

    THE OTHER WOMAN quickly bustles BILLY away.

                             WOMAN
              Come on, son.  Your Mother's very
              upset.


    INT.  BILLY'S BEDROOM

    It's empty as the WOMAN brings BILLY inside.

                             WOMAN
              Now you just sit up here and play
              for a while, alright?  That's all
              grown up stuff goin' on downstairs.
              And soon your Mama's gonna take you
              back home with her to Ohio.  Won't
              that be fun?

    She leaves and closes the door.  He sits alone in the
    middle of the floor.  He spins the wheels of his ambulance
    against the worn out rug.

                             BILLY
                      (softly, a siren)
              Wooooo... woooo...

    And he rolls it slowly out of frame.  Beat... beat...
    beat... it rolls back to him.  And it's been turned around
    to face him.  BILLY looks up and smiles.

    ANGLE

    to reveal a three year old GIRL, all in white.  She's the
    girl from the painting with the rag doll.

                             GIRL
              Vrooom... vrooom...

    BILLY

    He rolls it back to her.


    INT.  BOWLING ALLEY

    There's a piano bar and DOROTHY is in a ratty, red
    sequined dress, singing "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves
    You." As she does, WE SEE BILLY, age eight, not really
    watching, just sitting sullenly -- blowing air bubbles in
    his Coke.  Someone's watching though.  CHALMER MILLIGAN
    sits at the bar, smiling at DOROTHY.  She starts
    performing just to him.  BILLY realizes what's going on
    and watches carefully.  CHALMER catches BILLY'S look and
    feels exposed.  He turns his attention back to DOROTHY.

    LATER

    CHALMER and DOROTHY, laughing in a booth over drinks.

    PAN OVER

    to the next booth -- BILLY is fast asleep.


    EXT.  CARNIVAL - NIGHT

    Lots of people and rides.  BILLY, DOROTHY and CHALMER are
    in line for one ride, but as they get to the gate:

                             ATTENDANT
              Sorry, he's too little.  There's a
              height requirement.

    BILLY is stricken.

                             CHALMER
                      (to Billy)
              Well, tell ya what -- you wait here
              and we'll meet you right after.
              It's a short one, this one.

    He ushers DOROTHY onto the ride as BILLY steps aside --
    watching and waiting.


    INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

    CHALMER watches from the sofa as BILLY sits with crayons
    and a pad on the floor.  BILLY reaches for the red one,
    but CHALMER'S foot comes down on it.  A beat as BILLY
    looks up at him.  Finally, CHALMER lifts his foot and
    BILLY takes it.


    INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

    DOROTHY is shaking BILLY out of a deep sleep.  She's
    breathless with excitement.

                             DOROTHY
              Billy, wake up.  Look.

    She shows him an engagement ring on her finger.

                             DOROTHY
              He asked me to marry him.  We're not
              going to be alone anymore.

    She hugs him tight.


    INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

    BILLY and DOROTHY doing the dishes together.

                             BILLY
              I don't know what to call him.

                             DOROTHY
              Chalmer is your Daddy, now.  You
              call him Daddy Chal.

    BILLY looks into the living room at CHALMER, asleep in
    front of the TV, a beer in his hand.  CHALMER opens his
    eyes unexpectedly, startling BILLY.

                             CHALMER
              What are you doin' in there?  Only
              sissies help their Mama's do dishes.
              You come in here with me and watch
              some TV.

    BILLY is nervous.

                             DOROTHY
                      (privately)
              Go on.  He's you Daddy, now.  You
              mind him.  He loves you.

    BILLY goes inside.


    INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

    The three of them at the dinner table.  No talking -- just
    quiet eating.

                             DOROTHY
              Billy, would you please pass the
              salt?

    He grabs it and goes to hand it to his MOTHER, but CHALMER
    grabs his other wrist.

                             CHALMER
              Salt gets passed clockwise.

                             BILLY
              What?

                             CHALMER
              Everything at the table gets passed
              clockwise.

                             BILLY
              Why?

                             CHALMER
              Because that's how we did it when I
              was growin' up.  It learned me
              manners -- you don't have everybody
              reachin' all over the table for
              everything -- gettin' in everybody's
              food.

    BILLY passes it clockwise, via CHALMER, who gives it to
    DOROTHY.

                             DOROTHY
              Thank you.

                             CHALMER
              It's just like when I taught you to
              sit with your hands on your knees
              and your feet flat on the floor when
              you're not eatin'.  And you don't
              have to know the reason for
              everything, anyway.  If I say to do
              something, then that's enough.
              Right?

                             BILLY
              Yes.

                             CHALMER
              Yes, what?

                             BILLY
              Yes, Daddy Chal.


    INT.  LIVING ROOM - EVENING

    CHALMER, BILLY and DOROTHY watching TV.  Ed Sullivan.
    CHALMER'S got a beer in one hand and his other arm is
    around DOROTHY as he starts fondling her breast.

                             DOROTHY
                      (smiling awkwardly,
                       pulling away)
              Chalmer...

                             CHALMER
                      (a hoarse whisper)
              What...?

    He leans in to kiss her neck.  BILLY watches.  CHALMER
    looks right at him, then nuzzles her.

                             DOROTHY
                      (still mindful of
                       decorum)
              No...

                             CHALMER
                      (climbing on her now,
                       but not really
                       threatening)
              Don't tell me no -- we're married
              now.

    He thinks he's being playful.  A hand inside her blouse.
    BILLY still watches in silence.

                             DOROTHY
                      (catches Billy's look
                       to Chalmer)
              Billy...

                             CHALMER
              So?

    He looks at BILLY once more, then, never taking his eyes
    off him, slides his tongue into DOROTHY'S ear.

                             DOROTHY
                      (gets up)
              We can go in the bedroom.

    She leaves and goes upstairs.  BILLY looks at CHALMER.

                             CHALMER
              What are you looking at?
                      (an icy hiss)
              You bend them eyes while I'm talkin'
              to you, boy.

    BILLY looks down.  CHALMER drains his beer and tosses the
    empty can at him, then heads upstairs.  In a moment, we
    hear a hit.  DOROTHY screams.  Another hit.  BILLY sits
    closer to the TV -- turns up the volume.  A plate spinner
    on Ed Sullivan.  As the beating continues upstairs.  BILLY
    changes the channel, landing on an old Basil
    Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movie.  He stare hard
    as Holmes performs some miraculous demonstration of
    deduction.  BILLY turns up the volume till it drowns
    everything else out.


    INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

    BILLY sits drawing at the table while his MOTHER does the
    ironing.  The drawing is a landscape, and remarkably good
    for a nine year old.

                             DOROTHY
              Is it that late?  God, I don't know
              where the time went.

    She leaves the room and heads upstairs.  As BILLY looks
    up, he sees CHALMER standing in the next room, staring at
    him.  BILLY goes back to drawing, but is unnerved.  He
    looks up again -- CHALMER is gone.  He tentatively leaves
    the kitchen and pads very slowly into the living room.  No
    one there.  BILLY sits on the sofa and looks up -- there's
    CHALMER, leaning against the wall next to the entrance
    way.  BILLY is startled.

                             BILLY
              Hello, Daddy Chal...

    No response.  CHALMER'S eyes bore a hole right through the
    boy.  BILLY picks up a magazine.  He leaf's through a
    couple of pages, consumed with fright, then puts it back
    carefully -- perfectly -- in the center of the coffee
    table.  He glances up.  CHALMER hasn't moved.  He's still
    staring.  BILLY puts his hands on his knees and his feet
    flat on the floor.  Then he gets up and exits the room
    from the opposite side where CHALMER is.


    EXT.  BACK PORCH

    As BILLY comes out of the house.  He goes into the yard
    and wanders restlessly -- tosses a stick.  He gathers all
    his courage and looks back towards the house.  There is
    CHALMER, watching him from the window.  Terrified, BILLY
    starts to cry silently.  Suddenly, his MOTHER'S voice
    startles him.

                             DOROTHY
              Billy!

    She's at the upstairs window.

                             DOROTHY
              Come on to bed!


    INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

    BILLY lies awake.  He's exhausted, but more scared.  Every
    time he starts to nod off, he forces his eyes back open
    with a start.  He pinches his arm and twists hard to keep
    himself up.


    INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

    BILLY, eyes puffy from lack of sleep, sits opposite
    CHALMER and DOROTHY.  CHALMER doesn't look like he's slept
    much, either.

                             DOROTHY
              Look what I made for my two men
              this morning.  Pancakes and bacon
              and fresh squeezed juice...

                             CHALMER
              We're going to the farm today,
              Billy.  There's a lot to be done.

    BILLY is gripped by fear.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY and CHALMER moving down a long, lonely road.
    Neither one says a word.  They both just stare straight
    ahead.


    EXT.  CAR

    As it turns off one road and onto another -- this one
    containing the covered bridge.  It's the same one that
    adult BILLY passed in the police car.  A farm can be seen
    in the distance amongst the spindly, leafless trees.


    EXT.  FARM - DAY

    CHALMER sits on the ground, drinking beer and staring.

    ANGLE

    to include the corn crib from the charcoal animation.
    BILLY is locked inside, trying to ignore his step-father's
    stare.


    INT.  CORN CRIB

    BILLY sees a cardinal on a tree branch.  He has some
    paints with him and starts to sketch out the bird on a
    piece of slate.  Suddenly CHALMER pops up in front of him,
    carrying a shovel.  He unlocks the corn crib.

                             CHALMER
              Come on...

    He leads BILLY out and they walk off into a field as the
    cardinal flies away to freedom.


    EXT.  FIELD

    BILLY is digging a long hole that's already knee deep.
    CHALMER sits and watches.  He holds a rusty, hollow, metal
    pipe in his hand -- about a foot long and four inches
    wide.

                             CHALMER
              Six feet.  You hear me?

    BILLY continues digging.


    EXT.  FIELD

    CHALMER pushes a rototiller, churning up the ground for
    the coming season.

    WE FOLLOW him as he goes.  Finally, he passes the pipe he
    was holding earlier -- only now it sticks up six inches
    from the ground.  As CHALMER rides out of frame we hear
    the amplified sound of shallow breathing.


    INT.  BARN

    We see BILLY only from the naked torso up.  Through a
    window, we can see CHALMER outside, drinking under a tree.
    His pants are undone.  BILLY'S back is to us.  He's tied
    to the rototiller -- straddling it.  His eyes are wet
    from crying.  He struggles against the rope, but it's no
    use.  Then, his eyes fix into the middle distance.  He
    stares so hard, it hurts.

    A BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT

    shining straight into our eyes.  At first it has no form,
    no perimeters.

    BILLY

    staring.

    THE LIGHT

    feels like a birth as we PULL BACK from its center,
    gathering velocity.  It rumbles, then roars, until we
    finally get to it's outer edge.  Now it has a shape.  It's
    a spotlight -- sharp, defined.  Surrounded by darkness.
    Like the spot that shone on Johnny Morrison at the Eden
    Roc.

    BILLY

    staring even harder.

    THE SPOT

    as a form emerges from it's deepest recesses.  It's human.
    A teenage boy.  The figure stretches out it's hand.

    BILLY

    Suddenly, he blinks -- like we've seen the adult BILLY
    do.  His entire face seems to change.  He's not terrified
    anymore, merely confused.  He reaches his face over to his
    constrained hand and touches his cheek with his fingers.
    He has no idea why he's been crying.  He looks around the
    barn -- then out at CHALMER, who is oblivious.  BILLY
    looks at the rope around his wrists.  They are tied to
    each other, close together, but there's still some slack.
    He takes a beat, then uses one hand to push the thumb of
    his other hand far across it palm.  His eyes are clenched
    in concentration.  His hand turns beet red.  Suddenly,
    there's a snap and his thumb is successfully dislocated.
    With his thumb pulled out of its socket and draped across
    his palm, the thickest part of his hand is now thinner
    than his wrist, enabling him to slide it out from the
    rope.  He snaps it back in place and undoes his other
    wrist.  Outside the window, CHALMER is now passed out
    drunk.


    INT.  BARN

    THE CARDINAL painted on the piece of slate.  It's been
    signed: BILLY.  BILLY is fully dressed now, rubbing his
    still red thumb, when he stumbles upon it.  He picks up
    the paintbrush next to it and adds some touches.
    Satisfied, he signs a second name beneath the one that's
    already there: TOMMY.


    EXT.  STREET

    It's a brilliant Fall day.  BILLY, age nine, is walking to
    school past an apple orchard.  He carries a big, shiny red
    apple -- polishing it as he goes.  He never sees the car
    that suddenly rounds the bend and heads straight for him.
    We hear a MAN and a WOMAN giggling drunkenly from inside
    -- completely oblivious.  It is virtually upon him, when,
    as if shoved from behind by an invisible force, BILLY is
    thrown clear of the automobile.  It crushes the apple into
    sauce and disappears around the next bend, but BILLY lands
    safely.  He starts to cry.  Then we hear a voice.  It has
    a thick East European accent.

                             RAGEN'S VOICE
              Christene...

    BILLY looks up.

                             RAGEN'S VOICE
              Please... don't cry... I get you
              another apple.

    TIGHT

    on a adult pair of hands as they shimmy up a tree trunk
    and grab an apple.


    EXT.  STREET

    BILLY, holding this new apple, walking happily to school
    once more.

    RAGEN'S FACE

    against a dark and indistinct background.  He's inspired
    by the Eden Roc busboy -- intense, olive-skinned, with a
    full black moustache.

                             RAGEN
              I will always be here to protect
              you.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    BILLY, age twenty one, is working out with a set of
    nunchuks.  He handles them like an expert, like a killer.
    Sweat covers his bare chest.  His hands are a blur.  He
    punctuates each move with a throaty war cry, still in the
    thick Yugoslavian accent, as he uses a mannequin's face
    and torso to simulate the disarming and vicious pummeling
    of an attacker.  He ends with a fierce, sustained scream
    of a warrior.  When he comes back to himself, he looks
    down: the mannequin is in shreds.  He opens the
    refrigerator.  It's empty.  He grabs his wallet from his
    pocket and opens it.  It's empty.  He throws it angrily to
    the floor.  He goes to the sink and sticks his head under,
    to wash the sweat off the get a drink, when the doorbell
    rings.  BILLY approaches it warily.  He keeps his accent
    all through this.

                             BILLY
              Who is it?

                             GORDY (O.C.)
              Gordy.

    BILLY grabs an M-16 from under a chair, reaches high on a
    shelf for a clip and pops it in, then holds it to his side
    as he opens the door a few inches.  GORDY is eighteen,
    thin, pale and high as a kite.

                             GORDY
              Shit, it's cold.  You got any
              scotch?

    He starts to enter, but BILLY blocks his way.

                             GORDY
              What's wrong?  We gonna do this in
              front of the neighbors?  I've got
              the money.

    GORDY takes out sixty bucks in crumpled bills.  BILLY
    looks at it, then lets him in.  GORDY walks past him into
    the living room.

                             BILLY
              Where are you going?

                             GORDY
                      (not looking back,
                       imitates him)
              Where am I going?

    GORDY pulls out a dresser drawer and put it on the floor.

                             BILLY
              Hey.

    GORDY reaches in and BILLY moves right for him, the gun
    barrel coming to rest on his back.  GORDY pulls out a
    cellophane bag that's been duck taped to the back of the
    dresser.  It's got several smaller bags inside, each
    stocked with a different supply of pills.

                             GORDY
              Whoa.  Jackpot.

    He turns and sees the gun pointed straight at him.

                             GORDY
              What's wrong?  I showed you the
              money.

    He tosses it to BILLY.

                             GORDY
              Cool it.

    But BILLY is stunned.  He's never seen the pills before.
    He lowers his gun and grabs the bag.  As he opens it and
    pulls out its contents:

                             GORDY
              What are you gettin' all excited
              for?  Have I ever ripped you off?
              Never.  Wow, you got the reds.

    BILLY drops the bag to the floor.

                             BILLY
              How did you know this was there?

                             GORDY
                      (picking them up)
              That's where you always keep 'em.
              Oh no.  Are you gonna get all weird
              again?  I hate when you do this
              shit.

    GORDY pockets sixty dollars worth of speed, then sees the
    nunchuks and a set of free weights.

                             GORDY
              I didn't know you were so into that
              stuff.

    He picks up the nunchuks -- does a few comically inane
    moves.

                             BILLY
              Put them down.

                             GORDY
                      (he does)
              Boy, who put the bug up your ass
              today?  And what's with the commie
              accent?  You know, the guy I work
              for is looking for a bodyguard.
              Someone to drive the car to the
              pick-ups and look like an animal so
              no one pulls any shit.  You wanna
              meet him?  The pay is good.

                             BILLY
              How much?

                             GORDY
              I don't know -- ask him.  The
              sumbitch is made of money.  I'm
              goin' over there now.  You wanna
              come?

                             BILLY
              We need money.

                             GORDY
              So come on.  His name's Foley.

    BILLY grabs a sweatshirt and they leave.


    EXT.  HOOVER RESERVOIR - DAY

    As the water roars below, BILLY sits alone in his parked
    car.  Thirty yards away is a parked MERCEDES.  TWO MEN sit
    in the front seat, while GORDY leans in the back window
    talking to FOLEY.  BILLY is tense, but stoic.  In a
    moment, GORDY turns.  He gets out of the car.

                             GORDY
              He wants to talk to you.

    BILLY gets out of the car.  The other THREE MEN get out of
    theirs.  BILLY takes the long walk over, but upon reaching
    them one MAN spins him around to face the car while
    holding an automatic to his head and the OTHER starts to
    frisk him.  Immediately, BILLY elbows the MAN WITH THE GUN
    in the throat, delivers a quick flurry of knifehand karate
    strikes to his face, breaking his nose, then holds him in
    front of his own body.  BILLY grabs the MAN'S hand,
    wrapping his finger around the finger that was already
    guarding the trigger, and straightens the henchman's arm,
    using it to point the gun directly at FOLEY.

                             BILLY
              It is not good to move.  I put
              three bullets between your eyes
              before you take step.

    FOLEY puts his hands up.  BILLY turns to the SECOND
    FLUNKIE.

                             BILLY
              You.  Take gun from under jacket
              with two fingers and put on ground.

    The MAN hesitates.

                             BILLY
              Do it now or you will be smiling out
              of your sleeve.

    He does as BILLY says.  BILLY pushes the FIRST MAN away,
    holding onto the gun.

                             BILLY
              I would say you need better
              bodyguard than these two.

                             FOLEY
                      (to the two men)
              Go over there.  I'm going to have a
              talk with Mr. Milligan.


    INT.  MERCEDES

    FOLEY presses a button and a bar opens.

                             FOLEY
              What do you drink?

                             BILLY
              Vodka.

                             FOLEY
              No shit.  Where'd you get a name
              like Milligan?

                             BILLY
              Names mean nothing.  I am
              Yugoslavian.

                             FOLEY
              Well, Billy.  I'm in the shipping
              business, and my drivers need
              protection.

                             BILLY
              I am a protector.  You have job.  I
              do it.  I need money.

                             FOLEY
              Oh, don't worry, you'll make money.

                             BILLY
              Except one thing.  I do not hurt
              people unless my life is in danger,
              and I do not harm womans.

                             FOLEY
              It's a deal.

    They shake hands.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    GORDY'S taking a hit of speed and washing it down with a
    swig of vodka.

                             GORDY
              Where'd you learn karate?  Who are
              you really?  Ex-C.I.A.?  Mercenary?

    But BILLY has drawn into himself -- lips moving silently.

                             GORDY
              You O.K.?
                      (holds out the speed)
              Here, you want a B.B.?

    BILLY "returns".  He quickly checks out the scene -- where
    he is and who he's with.

                             BILLY
                      (almost relieved)
              Gordy.

    BILLY smiles and takes a pill.  After he swallows it,
    GORDY offers him the vodka.  BILLY reaches past him for a
    beer.

    GORDY shrugs and picks up a volume of poetry by Emily
    Dickinson.

                             GORDY
                      (laughs)
              Poetry?  You read this shit?  Or you
              got a girlfriend I don't know about?

    BILLY has never seen it before.  GORDY reads:

                             GORDY
              Hope is the thing with feathers
              That perches in the soul,
              And sings the tune without the words
              And never stops at all.

    BILLY grabs it and throws it across the room.

                             BILLY
              I've never seen it before.

                             GORDY
              No?  Then who the hell's it belong
              to?

    The book has landed in front of a painting of the
    withdrawn, teenage girl with long pair parted in the
    middle.

    As we PRESS IN on BILLY, we CROSSFADE to:


    INT.  BILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

    He's nine years old.  DOROTHY'S approaching voice wakes
    him up.

                             DOROTHY
              Billy!  you're gonna be late for
              school!

    She opens the door.

                             DOROTHY
              Billy, come on.

    He looks at her, confused.

                             DOROTHY
              Let's go.  I'm making blueberry
              pancakes.


    INT.  SPOT

    The bright, white light, surrounded by darkness.  PHIL is
    there, tucking a napkin into his collar.  He's a tough
    looking twenty year old with bad skin and three days of
    growth of beard.


    INT.  KITCHEN

    BILLY, still age nine, tucking a napkin into his collar.
    He's smothering his pancakes in a ton of syrup and wolfing
    them down in huge, convict size bites.

                             DOROTHY
              I'm not going to show this report
              card to Daddy Chal.  One D, all the
              rest F's... What's wrong, Billy?  I
              know you're bright.  You go to
              school every day.  Why don't you
              learn?  It's like there's two
              Billy's.  And one of them I don't
              care for very much at all.  Now
              you're going to have to try and do
              better, and that's all there is to
              it.  Understand?

                             BILLY
              Do you have any black coffee?


    INT.  THIRD GRADE CLASSROOM

    It's very Eisenhower fifties mid-west.  Thanksgiving
    turkey cut-outs on the windows; Autumn leaf displays, etc.
    The CHILDREN are all taking their seats.  BILLY doesn't
    know were he belongs.  He finally sits, but immediately, a
    GIRL approaches.

                             GIRL
              That's my seat.

                             BILLY
              Go to hell.

                             GIRL
              Miss Haworth, Billy Milligan just
              swore at me and he's sitting in my
              seat.

                             BILLY
                      (under his breath)
              Jesus...

    BILLY stands and the GIRL sits.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              What's the matter, Billy?  Don't you
              remember where your seat it?

    He shakes his head no.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              I'm getting very tired of this
              little game, Billy.  Now take your
              seat.

    By this time, there's only one seat left unoccupied.
    BILLY sits.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              Thank you.  Now maybe we can get on
              with our arithmetic test.

    As MISS HAWORTH passes out the mimeographed quiz sheets,
    BILLY is gripped with fear.  He looks at the sheet.  It's
    like hieroglyphics to him.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              Alright class, you may begin.

    The KIDS start work -- BILLY freezes.  A beat then:

    TIGHT

    on an adult hand, holding a pencil, poised over the test.
    We hear an English accent:

                             ARTHUR (O.C.)
              Oh, dear, really.  You must be
              joking.

    ANGLE

    on the classroom.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              Ssh!

    BILLY sits with a completely different posture and
    demeanor.  He looks down his nose at the test and races
    through it.  He's done almost immediately and puts down
    his pencil.

    MISS HAWORTH

    looks up from her desk.

                             MISS HAWORTH
              Done already?

    ANGLE

    to include BILLY.  He's back to being himself -- scared
    and confused.  He has no idea how he got to school.

                             MISS HAWORTH
                      (approaching)
              Aren't you even going to check your
              work?

    He doesn't respond.  She takes the paper and looks at it.
    Then:

                             MISS HAWORTH
              Let me see your arms.

    He rolls up his sleeves.  Then she looks all around his
    desk.

                             BILLY
              What's wrong?

                             MISS HAWORTH
                      (extremely
                       suspicious)
              They're all correct.


    EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

    It's a Saturday and there's no one around, except for
    BILLY, now age fourteen.  He's throwing rocks from about
    thirty yards away -- trying to break windows.  We're
    behind him as he hears PHIL'S twenty year old voice.

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              Hey.

    VERY QUICK CUTS.  FIRST:

    An ANGLE on BILLY'S face, speaking as PHIL, with a thick
    New York accent.

                             BILLY
              What are you doing?

    Another ANGLE on BILLY'S face, answering as KEVIN -- also
    twenty.

                             BILLY
              Bustin' windows.

    An adult hand, picking up a rock.

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              Cool.  Let me.

    BILLY

    throwing a rock and shattering a window.


    INT.  SPOT

    PHIL, in the light, wiping the dirt off his hands.


    EXT.  THE SCHOOL

    BILLY is baffled, looking around.

                             BILLY
                      (as Kevin)
              Where are you?

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              Where are you?

                             BILLY
                      (as Kevin)
              I'm standing on the hill -- behind
              the school.

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              Yeah?  Me too.


    INT.  SPOT

    KEVIN, now in the light.  He's twenty, blonde hair, green
    eyes -- a tough guy like PHIL.

                             KEVIN
              What's your name?

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              Philip, what's yours?

                             KEVIN
              Kevin.

    ANGLE

    In the distance, KEVIN is lit in the spot.  In the F.G.,
    PHIL in semi-darkness, is unaware of him.

                             PHIL
              That's a funny name.

                             KEVIN
              Yeah?  I'd bust you if I could see
              you.

                             PHIL
              Where ya live?


    EXT.  THE SCHOOL

    BILLY casually throws rocks at the school, breaking
    windows as he speaks.

                             BILLY
                      (as Kevin)
              On Spring Street.  Where you from?

                             PHIL (O.C.)
              I'm from Brooklyn, New York, but now
              I live on Spring Street, too.


    INT.  SPOT

    KEVIN

                             KEVIN
              It's 933 Spring.  A white house.
              Owned by some guy named Chalmer
              Milligan.  He calls me Billy.

    KEVIN reaches down.


    EXT.  SCHOOL - BILLY'S HAND

    picking up a rock.

                             BILLY (O.C.)
              Jeez -- that's where I live.  I know
              the same guy.  He calls me Billy,
              too.  I play along for the pancakes.

    BILLY throws the rock -- then turns around.


    INT.  SPOT

    KEVIN turns, as BILLY just did, and comes face to face
    with PHILIP.

                             PHIL
              I ain't never seen you there.

                             KEVIN
              I ain't never seen you there,
              either.

                             PHIL
                      (popping open a
                       Zippo)
              Well, shit, pal, let's go down to
              the woods and light fires.

                             KEVIN
              Cool.


    EXT.  SCHOOL

    BILLY runs off towards the woods, Zippo in hand.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    BILLY, age twenty one, has discovered drugs stashed behind
    the dresser drawer.  He checks them out, then speaks with
    Arthur's British accent.

                             BILLY
              L.S.D.  Kevin and Philip have become
              undesirables.  Something must be
              done to banish them from the spot.

    BANG!

    MUSIC blasts.  Elton John's "Madman Across the Water".
    The screen is filled with a wash of deep blue.  BILLY
    enters frame, silhouetted against it, paintbrush in hand.
    He attacks the blue with whites and yellows.

    In a SERIES OF CUTS:

    The painting is incredibly detailed -- fine, delicate
    lines forming eyes and strands of hair -- but his manner
    is frenetic.  He paces the floor, staring at the canvas
    the way a matador sizes up a bull, then hurls himself at
    it -- always reigning himself in to achieve the
    controlled, meticulous tension that the painting demands.

    THE SPOT

    ALLEN painting.  Cigarette dangling from his mouth.

    THE PAINTING

    further along.  It's like a story unfolding.  Symbols,
    clocks, faces -- all corresponding to some private vision
    of BILLY'S.


    INT.  APARTMENT

    TIME CUT.  BILLY is drenched now.  He paints a section,
    then steps back to look at it.  Dissatisfied he takes a
    can of red paint and flings it across the canvas.  He
    stops a moment to catch his breath, then starts all over
    again.  In a moment, he "blinks".  His demeanor changes,
    his posture, the way he holds the brush.  He goes from
    looking like an artist in complete command of his craft,
    to looking like some guy holding a paintbrush.  He sees
    the bag of drugs ARTHUR had left out earlier and picks
    them up, hungrily.  From out of an envelope, he shakes out
    a small piece of paper with a stamp of a loopy cartoon
    horse on it.  He smiles wickedly, then puts it to his
    tongue and licks the purple microdot off the tip of its
    muzzle.

    BILLY

    painting -- tripping out of his mind.

    BILLY - LATER

    now ALLEN, the personality who had originally started the
    painting.  He's looking aghast.

    HIS POV

    PHIL has turned it into some sixties psychedelic nightmare
    and signed it.

    BILLY

    lights a cigarette, then starts painting over it --
    starting again.

    BILLY

    painting in detail once more.  His neck is sore.  His
    fingers are sore.  It's pitch black outside.

    BILLY - DAWN

    finally finished.  Ashtray overflowing.  He's looking at
    the result.  It is a major work -- complicated -- probably
    over-complicated -- full of the confusion and enormity of
    what's inside him.  He signs it: ALLEN.  He wipes the
    sweat off his face, walks to the sofa and lies down.  He's
    asleep in seconds.


    INT.  APARTMENT - LATER

    BILLY wakes up.  A beat.  He walks over to the painting.
    He looks at it, then reaches for a handful of crayons.


    INT.  SPOT

    Three year old CHRISTENE picking up crayons.


    INT.  APARTMENT - LATER

    BILLY stands stunned.  There are childish squiggles and
    drawings all over the canvas.  It's completely ruined.
    His eyes fill with tears.


    INT.  DARKENED AREA

    There is a male figure moving through the shadows, though
    we can hardly discern any activity.

    ANGLE

    to include the spot in the distance.  RAGEN is in it.  In
    the foreground, now, the lurking male figure enters the
    frame.  We see him, only partially and from behind,
    watching RAGEN.


    EXT.  WOODS

    Fourteen year old BILLY is practicing pulling a knife from
    his boot and chucking it at a tree with lightning speed
    and accuracy.


    INT.  SPOT

                             ARTHUR'S VOICE
              Ragen Vadascovinich.

    RAGEN turns quickly.


    EXT.  WOODS

    BILLY has his knife out in a defense stance.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN is in the same position.

                             RAGEN
              Where are you?

                             ARTHUR'S VOICE
              I'm right here.


    EXT.  WOODS

    BILLY is all alone, talking to himself in the woods.

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              We are in the same body.  We share
              it.  You are in my head and I am in
              yours.  And there are others as
              well, but most of them don't know
              about each other.


    INT.  SPOT

    ARTHUR stands just outside the spot, talking to RAGEN.
    He's twenty two, with a patrician air and John Lennon
    glasses.

                             RAGEN
              Is true -- I have heard voices
              before -- but how can you be same
              place I am?  Is not possible.

                             ARTHUR
              It's simple, really.  Whoever is on
              the spot holds the consciousness.
              Right now, it's you.  When it's
              someone else, we are very often
              unaware.

    RAGEN eyes him warily.

                             ARTHUR
              Do you play chess?

                             RAGEN
              Of course.


    INT.  BILLY'S MIND

    RAGEN and ARTHUR in a limbo-like space, playing chess.
    Though they are obviously sitting, we can see not chairs.
    It's like they are sitting in blackness.  In the
    background, we can see CHRISTENE, all of three years old,
    sitting in the spot, drawing happily.

                             ARTHUR
              If we are to survive in the world,
              we will have to bring some order out
              of this chaos.  Billy wanders
              around, oblivious, starting things
              and not finishing them -- getting
              into all kinds of ridiculous
              scrapes -- switching in front of
              people.  And some, like Philip and
              Kevin are quite destructive and need
              to be carefully monitored.


    INT.  CLASSROOM

    Fourteen year old BILLY and his class are taking a math
    test, but BILLY, currently occupied by CHRISTENE'S
    personality, is drawing pictures all over the test sheet.
    A GIRL sitting next to him is watching him incredulously.

    ARTHUR AND RAGEN

    playing chess.  CHRISTENE drawing in the spot in the
    background.

                             ARTHUR
              Ah, an Indian defense.  Very good.

                             RAGEN
              Who is that?

    He indicates a four year boy sitting alone, staring
    blankly.

                             ARTHUR
              That is Shawn.  He's completely
              deaf.  He takes the spot to block
              out his mother's cries.  We've got
              all kinds here.  But there's got to
              be a way of controlling things.

                             RAGEN
              Does Billy know about us?

                             ARTHUR
              No.

                             RAGEN
              Should he be told?

                             ARTHUR
              I think it would drive him insane.

                             RAGEN
              Then how can things be controlled?

                             ARTHUR
              We'll make rules.  Everyone will
              have specific duties that are
              tailored toward their particular
              talents.  Tommy is an electronics
              genius, as well as an escape artist.
              Several of us are painters.  I excel
              at foreign languages and dabble in
              medicine and biochemistry.  The
              girls do domestic chores.

                             RAGEN
              There are women here?

                             ARTHUR
              Oh yes.  April and Adalana.  They do
              the cooking, the shopping, the
              cleaning... checkmate.

                             RAGEN
              What about me?

                             ARTHUR
              You shall continue your role as
              protector...


    EXT.  ROAD

    Fourteen year old BILLY jogging -- sweat pours down.

                             ARTHUR (V.O.)
              ... developing yourself physically...
              learning the martial arts --
              weaponry -- being able to step into
              a dangerous situation at a moments
              notice.

    He speeds up -- running harder and harder.  The intensity
    in his face is enormous -- as if every fiber of his being
    were perfectly focused on this one activity.


    INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY

    A TEACHER is droning on, writing endlessly at the
    blackboard.  She has lost control of the class, which is
    chatting away, paying little or no attention.

                             TEACHER
              The War of the Roses was a series of
              wars fought by two English families
              in the late 15th Century for the
              rule of the country.

    As she speaks, the class gets quieter and quieter in the
    background, until there's just the TEACHER and a strange
    whispering.

                             TEACHER
              The House of Lancaster had a red
              rose as its emblem while the House
              of York had a white rose.  The
              forces of the House of Lancaster won
              and their leader, Henry Tudor,
              father of the future Henry VII,
              became king...

    Finally, she turns around and stops speaking.

    ANGLE

    to include class.  They are all staring at BILLY, age
    fourteen, who sits at his desk, eyes glazed and half
    rolled into his head -- lips moving a mile a minute --
    whispering in a strange gibberish.


    INT.  SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

    A sign on his desk identifies him as such.  He faces
    BILLY.

                             COUNSELOR
              Do you know why you're here, Billy?
              Do you want to talk about it?

    BILLY looks away.  The COUNSELOR comes around his desk and
    sits close to BILLY.

                             COUNSELOR
              You can say anything here.  Go on.
              What are your feelings?

                             BILLY
              It's like a dream that comes and
              goes.  My step-dad hates me.  I hear
              him screaming.  I hear other voices,
              too.  I get blamed for stuff I
              didn't do.  People call me a liar.
              I never know what time it is -- or
              what day it is.  Sometimes I feel
              like I'm going crazy.  I don't know
              what's in my pockets.  And I see
              lots of things that aren't real.
              There's a locked door and someone's
              pounding to get out.  I see a woman
              falling down and suddenly she's
              turning into a pile of metal and I
              can't reach her and I'm so scared
              and lonely and I'm afraid to ask for
              help.  I need help.  Oh God...
                      (self-conscious,
                       through sniffles)
              Hey, I'm the only kid who can take a
              trip without LSD.

                             COUNSELOR
              It's all right, Billy.  We're going
              to get you some help.


    INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

    BILLY being examined by a G.P. -- while his MOTHER looks
    on.  After a bit:

                             DOCTOR
              Ears normal, eyes normal, throat
              O.K. -- I don't see anything yet.
              Alright, Billy, take off your pants.

    His face crumbles.  He's overcome by fear.

                             DOROTHY
              Go on, Billy, you mind the doctor.

    The DOCTOR reaches for BILLY'S belt, and BILLY screams in
    terror.

                             BILLY
              Nooo!!!

    It echoes into eternity as WE CUT TO:


    INT.  COLUMBUS STATE HOSPITAL

    BILLY walking down a corridor with a different DOCTOR,
    leaving his MOTHER behind.  As they go, they pass all
    manner of disturbed children.

                             DOCTOR
              Don't worry, Billy.  No one's going
              to hurt you.  We're here to help
              you.


    INT.  EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

    The DOCTOR gives BILLY two pills in a small, paper
    container.  BILLY puts them in his mouth.

    QUICK CUTS:

    BILLY taking different pills on a different day.

    The same day.

    And again.  Now he washes them down with water.


    INT.  DOCTOR'S CONSULTATION OFFICE

    BILLY, DOROTHY and CHALMER, across the desk from the
    DOCTOR.

                             DOCTOR
              He certainly seems high strung, and
              his mood swings are unpredictable.
              He also likes to pretend or role
              play quite a bit.  But I don't
              really see that there's anything
              more we can do for him here.  Try
              changing his diet.  He seems to do
              better on Jello day.


    INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY

    As BILLY walks through with his books, other KIDS point
    and whisper to each other.  Some laugh.  As he passes one
    little GIRL, she yells from behind.

                             GIRL
              Billy Milligan is a psycho!  He was
              in the loony bin!

    The KIDS laugh.


    EXT.  THE ROOF OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

    It's windy as all hell as BILLY inches his way towards the
    edge.  He's a million miles away -- his eyes fixed in the
    middle distance.


    INT.  SPOT

    BILLY, with the very same expression, inside the
    spotlight.  We hear voices from around the periphery.

                             RAGEN'S VOICE
              We must do something.  We must act
              now.

                             ARTHUR'S VOICE
              Push him off the spot or he'll jump.


    EXT.  THE ROOF

    BILLY still moving forward -- ever closer.


    INT.  SPOT

    He appears to be walking -- but he doesn't move.  It's as
    if he's on a treadmill.

                             TOMMY'S VOICE
              Oh let him jump.  Who needs him
              around, anyway?  Always embarrassing
              us -- always getting us into
              trouble...

                             ARTHUR'S VOICE
              No.  It's our responsibility to keep
              him safe.


    EXT.  ROOF

    BILLY'S picking up speed now.  This is the final push.


    INT.  SPOT

    BILLY going fast -- still gaining no ground.

                             RAGEN'S VOICE
              Take spot.  Quickly.

                             ARTHUR'S VOICE
                      (he's trying)
              I can't.

                             TOMMY'S VOICE
              The hell with him.  Loser...


    EXT.  ROOF

    BILLY at the edge -- about to jump.


    INT.  SPOT

                             RAGEN'S VOICE
              No!

    And now RAGEN emerges from the darkness, running full
    speed.  He tackles BILLY.


    EXT.  ROOF

    BILLY suddenly throwing himself to the ground just a step
    before going over.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN and BILLY on the ground.

                             RAGEN
                      (after catching his
                       breath)
              We must put him to sleep, is too
              dangerous otherwise.

    ARTHUR emerges close enough to the light to be visible.

                             ARTHUR
              I agree.  He can no longer function
              for himself.  He shall relinquish
              the spot indefinitely.  Even if it
              means he never wakes up again.


    EXT.  ROOF

    BILLY, on the ground, eyelids heavy, lips moving.
    Suddenly, he is still.  Then, his eyes open fully.  He
    gets up.  He's completely confused at being on the roof.


    INT.  SPOT

    Which is now occupied by ALLEN, the fourteen year old, all
    alone in the light.  His confused expression is an exact
    duplicate of BILLY'S on the roof.  Somewhere in the B.G.,
    a small girl laughs softly.

    WE PAN OVER

    into the surrounding semi-darkness, where RAGEN kneels
    before CHRISTENE, a finger to his lips.

                             RAGEN
              Ssh.  Billy is sleeping.

    WE CONTINUE TO PAN

    as RAGEN indicates BILLY, lying in what we can only assume
    is a bed -- but the darkness is too thick to see below his
    body.  He is fast asleep.

    THIS IMAGE TRANSFORMS INTO ROTOSCOPE ANIMATION

    which segues into a series of fluid images:

    PAINTINGS

    done by BILLY.  Portraits, still lifes, landscapes -- done
    and signed by different personalities, ending with a
    portrait of SHAWN.


    INT.  LANCASTER ELECTROPLATING

    It looks like something out of Dante's Inferno.  Gigantic
    machinery, churning out sparks and steam, motored by
    propane and hydraulics.  The noise is deafening as huge,
    hook-covered ladders roll on suspended tracks and dip an
    endless supply of metal parts into a succession of
    electrified acid baths.  MEN duck and weave in goggles and
    huge, rubber gloves, narrowly avoiding decapitation or
    electrocution as they do their routines.

    WE TRACK TO BILLY

    standing at the operator's control panel.  It's a
    mystifying series of buttons, levers and speakers -- and
    BILLY is completely dumbfounded.

    BILLY POV

    He sees everything, but hears nothing.  Silence.  He is
    deaf.

    ANGLE - SOUND NORMAL

    as suddenly there's a zinc stack up in one of the acetone
    rinses.  The parts keep rolling along on the overhead
    conveyor track -- compounding the jam.

                             WORKER
              Power off!  Power off!

    BILLY IN SILENCE

    knows he's yelling at him, but hasn't any idea what he's
    supposed to do.  He sees the WORKER'S lips move.

                             WORKER
              Milligan!

    The FOREMAN runs up and pulls the power switch.  The
    entire apparatus grinds to a halt.

                             FOREMAN
                      (we lip read only)
              What the hell is wrong with you?

    ANGLE - SOUND NORMAL

                             FOREMAN
              Don't you hear him?  Billy?  Knock
              knock...

    BILLY "blinks".  He's confused.  He knows where he is, but
    not how he got there.

                             FOREMAN
              What's going on?

                             BILLY
              Nothin', Ted.  We got a problem?

                             FOREMAN
              Yeah, we got a problem.  I got a
              train wreck over there and you're
              sittin' here pullin' your pud.  You
              do good work when you do it, but I
              can't run my factory at your
              convenience.

                             BILLY
              What are you talkin' about?
                      (calls out)
              Hey, Willie, you got a traffic jam?

                             FOREMAN
              I'm sorry, Billy.  You have to
              leave.

                             BILLY
              What?

                             FOREMAN
              You're fired.

                             BILLY
              Fired?

                             FOREMAN
              Come up front.  I'll pay you off for
              the week.


    INT.  CAFETERIA RESTAURANT - DAY

    BILLY is at the cashier with a tray full of food.  He's
    still got grease stained hands from work.

                             CASHIER
              That's $2.85, please.

    BILLY reaches into his wallet -- but it's empty.  He's
    completely confused.  He checks his other pockets as the
    line gets impatient behind him, but pulls out fists full
    of candy.  He looks at the CASHIER in embarrassment --
    then bolts out of the restaurant, leaving his food behind.


    INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

    BILLY lies in bed, eyes half closed, lips moving.  All we
    can make out is a vague muttering.


    INT.  SOMEBODY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Right smack in the middle of a party.  Lots of people
    dancing, drinking, making small talk.  We pick out BILLY,
    sitting on a sofa next to FRANCINE.  She's
    unselfconsciously beautiful.  Her edge is tough.
    Unpampered.  But not without its sweetness.  BILLY looks
    lost beside her.

                             FRANCINE
              You O.K.?

                             BILLY
              Yeah, fine.

                             FRANCINE
              I kept sayin' "Billy".  Did you hear
              me?

                             BILLY
              I was just thinking.  Sorry.

                             FRANCINE
                      (flirting a little)
              What about?  Somethin' I made you
              think about?

                             BILLY
              Uh... who's party is this?

                             FRANCINE
              I know, me too.  I know he works at
              the same plant as my friend Liz.
              But she told me you used to work
              there, too.

                             BILLY
              I, uh... I'm embarrassed.  I forgot
              your name.

                             FRANCINE
                      (playful)
              I didn't tell you yet.  It's
              Francine... And I know you're Billy.
              I asked Liz right when I came in and
              seen ya.  God, that must sound so
              slutty.

                             BILLY
              I like girls to be a little slutty.

                             FRANCINE
                      (laughs)
              I bet you do.

                             BILLY
              I don't like the stuck up kind.

                             FRANCINE
              I know -- me either.  Walkin' around
              all perfect like they don't have no
              dark part.  But you know they do,
              'cause everybody does.  That's my
              favorite part -- the dark part.
              How about you?

                             BILLY
              I don't know.  I guess I've never
              run into it.

                             FRANCINE
              Sure you have.  People just don't
              like you knowin' that's what you ran
              into.  Hey, do that trick with your
              eyes again.

                             BILLY
              What trick?

                             FRANCINE
              Where you make your eyes go funny.

                             BILLY
              How much have you had to drink?

                             FRANCINE
              Me?  What about you?

    He looks at the beer in his hand, not knowing how it got
    there, and not feeling the least bit drunk.

                             FRANCINE
              One minute you're fallin' down
              drunk, the next you're sober.  You
              gotta teach me that one.  So, are we
              going to your place?

    He looks at her -- suddenly brightened.

                             FRANCINE
              You said you'd show me your
              paintings.  Come on, I wanna see
              'em.  I'll just say goodnight to
              Liz.

    She gets up and crosses to her girlfriend.  BILLY sits
    there and fades away into himself.  Immediately, he's back
    -- drunk and cocky.  He downs the rest of his beer and
    walks toward FRANCINE, deftly grabbing a joint out from
    behind some guy's ear as he passes.  He puts an arm around
    her waist and leads her out.


    INT.  CAR

    Parked on the street -- BILLY and FRANCINE inside.  She's
    busy looking in her compact.

                             FRANCINE
              Are you O.K. to drive?  You downed
              at least two sixes that I saw.

    BILLY "leaves" a moment, then "returns" -- he has changed.

                             FRANCINE
              Huh?  Are you O.K.?

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              I'm perfectly fine.

                             FRANCINE
                      (laughing, and doing
                       an  English accent)
              Oh, well then, home, William.

    He starts the car and pulls out.


    EXT.  STREET

    As BILLY and FRANCINE drive off.

                             FRANCINE (V.O.)
              You're on the wrong side of the
              road!

    And, indeed, he is.  An oncoming car narrowly misses them.
    He pulls back to the right side and they continue out of
    frame.

    PAINTINGS

    four or five, one after the other.  Landscapes,
    portraits...

    FRANCINE

    looking at them with BILLY.

                             FRANCINE
              Hey, you're really good.  I mean it.
              The trees look like trees -- the
              people look like people... I
              couldn't do that.

                             BILLY
                      (he's Allen now)
              Thanks.

                             FRANCINE
              You sure must like kids.

    Several of the portraits are of the "children".

                             BILLY
                      (he feels this
                       deeply)
              Kids are very important.  But you
              have to be careful how you paint
              them -- they're so easy to mess
              up...

    She leans over and kisses him tenderly.  They separate.
    She leads him to the bed.  They kiss again.  Their eyes
    are closed -- but he opens his mid-kiss.  His eyeballs
    drift with nystagmus and a tear emerges -- rolling down
    his cheek.  He closes them again as he lays her down.


    INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

    BILLY is naked, fast asleep.

    ANGLE

    to include FRANCINE, in his oversized tee shirt, silently
    looking around the apartment.  It's fairly run down and
    cheaply furnished.  There is a conspicuous absence of
    photographs.  She approaches BILLY'S desk.  In one area,
    it is stacked with medical texts and biology primers.  In
    another, tools, wires and electronic parts lie scattered.
    She opens a drawer, checking to make sure she's not waking
    him, and, inside, finds a few children's books: Dr. Seuss
    "Green Eggs and Ham", "Little Red Riding Hood", etc.  She
    closes it and opens another.  Inside are papers in hand
    written Arabic.  Pages and pages of it.  She puts them
    back and closes the drawer.  She moves to his closet, goes
    inside and closes the door behind her.  She pulls a string
    and the light goes on.  There among his clothes, she finds
    a .38 pistol inside a shoe box.  She smiles.  She's found
    the dark part.  She closes the box, turns off the light
    and opens the door.  There stands BILLY, scaring the shit
    out of her.

                             BILLY
                      (sharply)
              What are you doing in there?

                             FRANCINE
              I got cold.  I was looking for
              pajamas or a sweater.

    A beat, as he scrutinizes her.  She smiles privately.  He
    grabs a robe off a chair and puts it around her shoulders.
    He holds her to him.

                             BILLY
              What happened?  Last thing I
              remember we laid down on the bed --
              did I fall asleep for a minute?

                             FRANCINE
              A minute?  It's almost dawn.  Come
              on back to bed.

    She leads him.  As they lie down, she kisses him.  She
    pulls away.

                             FRANCINE
              You're not tired, are you?  Once
              just ain't enough for me tonight.

    She looks at him -- eyes twinkling.  He has absolutely no
    memory of their having made love.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

    He sits at his desk, translating Arabic from a thick
    hardcover.  As he moves the book closer, a note falls out.
    It says: You have hidden talents.  - F.  BILLY crumples it
    up angrily, then feels something in his pocket.  He
    reaches in and pulls out an empty condom wrapper.  He
    throws it in the trash.

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              She spent the night.  Bloody hell.


    INT.  SHOWER

    BILLY scrubs himself, singing, feeling good.


    INT.  APARTMENT

    BILLY, in his jacket, grabs his lunch pail and heads out
    the door.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY driving, singing along with the radio.


    EXT.  LANCASTER ELECTROPLATING

    As BILLY pulls up.


    INT.  LANCASTER ELECTROPLATING

    In full operation.  The belly of the beast.  BILLY walks
    in, happy as a clam.  A couple of GUYS look at him funny.

                             BILLY
                      (nods)
              Roy.  Leaky.

    He makes his way to the makeshift locker area: there are
    boxes in rows attached to a wall, facing out.  Each one
    has a name written on masking tape.  Several GUYS are
    there, getting their goggles and gloves.  BILLY ambles up
    to what should be his box, but someone's in front of it.
    He looks at the tape.  There's a second piece of tape over
    what obviously was once his.  It now says JACK DECKER.
    DECKER turns around.

                             DECKER
              Yeah?

    BILLY is confused, but consumed with an all too familiar
    feeling of dread.  He starts to back up.  Another GUY
    walks past him.

                             GUY
              Hey, Billy.  Long time, no see...

    BILLY turns and bolts.  He nearly knocks over the FOREMAN
    as he heads for the door.


    EXT.  ELECTROPLATING FACTORY - MORNING

    BILLY runs out of the building and leans against the chain
    link fence.  A beat, then he changes.  His confusion and
    panic replaced by RAGEN'S predatory glare.


    EXT.  BAIT SHOP - NIGHT

    We're in back.  Crates of worms have been delivered and
    await unpacking tomorrow.

    ANGLE

    GORDY and BILLY in GORDY'S car as they pull up...

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              I do not like this.

                             GORDY
              Calm down.

                             BILLY
              They are early.

                             GORDY
              So they're early.  The merchandise
              won't have a chance to get stale.

    He pats the merchandise on the back seat: fourteen pounds
    of marijuana, divided into bricks.

                             GORDY
              Go on.  Take the stash bag.

    BILLY grabs a small satchel with a couple ounces in
    plastic bags inside, and gets out, leaving the door open.

    STACKS OF CRATES

    filled with worms.  BILLY and the CONNECTION meet in their
    shadows.

                             CONNECTION
              Well, well.  The Russky.

    BILLY is completely humorless.  He gives up the taste.
    The CONNECTION smells it.  Feels it.

                             CONNECTION
              Sticky.  Green.  Good.  Bring out
              the rest.

                             BILLY
              Where are the guns?

    The CONNECTION motions behind him.

    ANGLE

    A SECOND CONNECTION is standing by the car.  Beside him,
    on the ground, is a crate covered by a canvas tarp.

    BILLY and THE CONNECTION.

                             BILLY
              Bring over here.

                             CONNECTION
              Dope first.

                             BILLY
              No.

                             CONNECTION
              Look man, we're cuttin' you a
              ridiculous deal as it is.

    BILLY

    during the following, looks over at the canvas covered
    crate.  From underneath the bottom, he sees several worms
    crawl out.

                             CONNECTION (O.C.)
              You take advantage of my good nature
              and I'm gonna take my toys and go
              home.

    BILLY and CONNECTION.

    BILLY knows he's being stung.

                             BILLY
              We do not do business.

    He turns and walks back toward GORDY and the car.  In an
    moment, there is gunfire at his back.  As the TWO
    CONNECTIONS empty their clips, BILLY tears ass between
    columns of stacked bait.  Bullets splinter the wood,
    blowing holes wide enough for tangled masses of worms to
    squirm out of.  BILLY returns some fire but GORDY has no
    gun and can't cover him.  BILLY reaches the car and dives
    through the open window of the wide open door.  He uses
    the car chassis for protection, but it's too dangerous for
    him to lift himself high enough to see where he's
    shooting.

    BILLY

    lays on the ground and sees his attackers from their feet
    to the bottoms of their thighs.  He opens fire -- knee
    capping one, and ripping a hole in the other's ankles.
    They both hit the ground.  Now BILLY can see their faces
    under the car.  He smiles and waves.  GORDY has started
    the engine by now and BILLY hauls himself into the
    passenger seat.  They take off, leaving the two wounded
    CONNECTIONS writhing in the exhaust amongst the swarms of
    escaped worms.


    INT.  APARTMENT

    BILLY stands in the middle of the living room talking to
    himself in an English accent.

                             BILLY
              It's getting harder and harder to
              keep control.  The mix-up times are
              happening far too frequently.  The
              undesirable personalities have been
              stealing.  And today I found this.

    He's holding a bail receipt.

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              Someone is doing drugs.  No one can
              hold a job.

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              It's all slipping away...


    INT.  APARTMENT

    Press in on BILLY'S face -- lost, empty.  He closes his
    eyes and the screen blacks out.  A second later:

    BILLY'S POV

    separating from kissing FRANCINE.  She's sweating.  They
    have been making love.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    In a restaurant, facing people who are eating at other
    tables.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    BILLY looking in the medicine cabinet mirror in his
    bathroom.  It's morning and he's going to shave.  He opens
    the cabinet, reaches for the shaving cream, then stops.
    He can't figure out why there's a box of Tampax in there.
    Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    MEN working on a factory assembly line.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    Facing a MAN from the assembly line in a bar.  He's
    laughing at a joke BILLY told saying "You're a funny guy"
    -- so his response is directly to camera.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    FRANCINE cooking in BILLY'S kitchen.  We see her at the
    stove from behind.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    FRANCINE, holding a new box of tampons and a wastepaper
    basket, talking directly to camera.

                             FRANCINE
                      (peeved)
              Why do you keep throwing out my
              tampons?  My toothbrush and my
              hairspray, too.  You know, if you
              don't want me to keep stuff here,
              just tell me.

    A SECOND LATER:

    A FOREMAN -- angry, veins bulging in his forehead.

                             FOREMAN
                      (to camera)
              What do you call this?

    He holds up a wrongly put together piece of machinery.

                             FOREMAN
              My six year old could put this
              together.  Go home, Milligan.
              You're fired.

    Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    BILLY'S hands shaking out a Tuinal and a Quaalude from two
    separate bottles.  He lifts his hands toward the lens.
    Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    Painting on a canvas.  Blackout.

    A SECOND LATER:

    FRANCINE, naked, sitting up in bed.  She's upset.

                             FRANCINE
                      (to camera)
              I don't understand it.  You're so
              gentle when you make love.

    BILLY

    sweating, sitting opposite her in bed.  The camera
    continues pressing in on his face as it did at the start
    of this section.


    EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

    It's a roadside stop on the highway -- empty and quiet.
    BILLY is outside his car with the ATTENDANT, who's
    finishing filling the tank.  BILLY pays him and gets back
    in the car.


    INT.  CAR

    As BILLY sits.  His eyes close a moment.  When they re-
    open, they are filled with fear and confusion.  He sits
    immobilized for a long moment, looking around for help.
    He moves his hands toward the steering wheel.

    TIGHT

    on the steering wheel.  Two small child's hands reach into
    frame and grab it.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY with his adult hands on the steering wheel.  He
    looks down.

    TIGHT

    on the gas pedal as a small child's foot tries vainly to
    reach it.  He's way too short.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY, trying not to panic.  He rubs his nose with his
    sleeve.  Finally, he moves over to the passenger seat and
    waits for an adult to drive him home.

    LATER

    Same situation, only now he has to go to the bathroom.  He
    holds his crotch like a little kid.  He gets out of the
    car and sees the "MENS" sign.  All is quiet as he walks
    past three or four parked cars and enters the bathroom.


    INT.  BATHROOM

    It's very dimly lit and BILLY'S eyes need a second to
    adjust.  The lightbulb's been removed from the overhead
    fixture.  The stall door is closed.  A middle aged MAN in
    a sweater and glasses is washing his hands.  There are two
    urinals, one low for children.  That's the one BILLY goes
    to.  The MAN at the sink looks at BILLY in the mirror.
    The stall door opens and a SECOND MAN steps out.  He's a
    big, working class kind of guy in a porkpie hat and
    leather jacket.  Instead of leaving, he just stands
    against one wall.  In a moment, a WOMAN comes out of the
    same stall.  She's tall and flamboyant.  She sashays over
    to the urinal beside BILLY and glances over.  Now we get
    our first real look at her.  It's immediately clear that
    she is a man in drag.  BILLY, more confused than
    frightened, looks at the transvestite, who smiles.  Now
    the other two men go into the toilet stall and close the
    door.

                             TRANSVESTITE
              Hey sweetheart, got somethin' there
              for me?

    The TRANSVESTITE reaches down to touch BILLY'S penis.

    ANGLE

    BILLY opening his eyes.  There's fire in them.  BILLY
    grabs the TRANSVESTITE by the blouse, lifts him off the
    ground and throws him into the side of the toilet stall,
    leaving a big dent in the metal.  He/she slides down,
    quivering, to the floor.  The TWO MEN come out of the
    stall.  One gets away, but one runs smack into BILLY who
    punches him hard in the face.  His ring cuts open the
    MAN'S lip.  He turns back to the TRANSVESTITE, who has
    gotten up and is shrieking at him, waving a knife.

                             TRANSVESTITE
              You bastard!  I'll cut your heart
              out, motherfucker!

    In a flash, BILLY does a quick flurry of karate hits and
    kicks that leave the TRANSVESTITE unconscious under the
    sink.  BILLY looks over to the SECOND MAN.

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              He will live.  I am very careful
              about what bones I break.

    Suddenly, BILLY blinks hard -- shakes his head -- looks
    around, quickly surveying the situation.  He picks up the
    TRANSVESTITE'S purse up off the floor and empties it --
    nothing valuable.  He turns back to the SECOND MAN.

                             SECOND MAN
              No... please...

    BILLY takes the MAN'S watch off his wrist.  The MAN offers
    his wallet, which BILLY takes.  He now has a New York
    accent.

                             BILLY
              The jacket.

    He takes it off the BILLY grabs it.

                             BILLY
              Don't breath a word, you hear me?
              You hear me?

                             SECOND MAN
                      (breathless)
              Yes...

                             BILLY
                      (holds up wallet)
              I know where you live, now.

    And BILLY leaves.


    INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

    From the bathroom we hear the shower running while
    FRANCINE, sorting dirty laundry on the bed, has found
    something that's stopped her dead in her tracks.  The MAN
    from the gas station's wallet lies in front of her, and in
    her hands she holds credit cards with this stranger's
    name.  She looks over to the dresser.  There's the watch.
    Over the back of the chair is the leather jacket.  On the
    desk is a fistful of money.  The shower is turned off.
    She freezes.  She quickly puts the things back in the
    wallet and the wallet back in BILLY'S pocket.  BILLY
    emerges from the bathroom in a towel and kisses her on the
    head as he passes.


    INT.  GRILLI'S TAKEOUT ITALIAN - NIGHT

    GRILLI is making BILLY a hero: sausage, provolone, tomato
    sauce.  He puts it, steaming hot, into a white paper bag.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    BILLY enters, tosses the keys on the table, lays the white
    bag on the counter, and goes into the bedroom.  He walks
    into the closet and bends for his slippers as the door
    shuts behind him.  He stands up and hits his head on the
    shelf.  He slumps down, holding his head.

    OUTSIDE THE CLOSET

    crouched, he kicks open the door.  He's changed.  He's
    like a panther.  He grabs a gun from a shoebox and stalks
    the apartment.  As he enters the kitchen, he senses
    movement.  There's a strange, white bag on the counter,
    and the steam rising makes it crinkle and move.  BILLY
    quickly aims and fires, bouncing it off the wall.  He
    ducks behind the counter, then peers over it cautiously.
    The gun trained on the bag as it lays on the floor.  He
    walks around the counter and carefully uses the gun barrel
    to open the top of the bag.  There he sees what looks like
    a bloody mess and jumps back, firing again.  Finally he
    can see that it's a sandwich.  Confused, he picks it up
    and puts it back on the counter.  He goes back in the
    bedroom, puts the gun down and lays on top of the bed.  He
    closes his eyes.


    INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

    BILLY enters, rubbing his stomach.  He grabs a plate and a
    napkin and goes for the white bag.  He sees what a mess it
    is.  He pulls out the shredded sandwich.

                             BILLY
              What the fuck...?


    INT.  GRILLI'S

    The phone rings and GRILLI picks it up.

                             GRILLI
              Grilli's Heros.

                             BILLY
                      (on phone)
              What's going on?  I bought a
              Stromboli hero and when I got it
              home it was all mangled.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    BILLY on the phone.

                             BILLY
              It looks like it's been put through
              a blender.  You son of a bitch, you
              just lost yourself a customer.

    He hangs up.


    INT.  GRILLI'S

    GRILLI is completely confused.  As he hangs up:

                             GRILLI
              Ohio, man.  Must be something in the
              water...


    EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

    BILLY'S car zipping down a two lane highway in the rain.
    He's swerving.


    INT.  CAR - NIGHT

    BILLY unloads a couple of Black Beauties and washes them
    down with a swig of Jack Daniels.


    EXT.  POND - NIGHT

    It's not far from the side of the road.  BILLY'S pulled
    the car over and sits, barefoot, in the swampy grass,
    looking out at the water.  A stray dog comes out of the
    shadows.  He's big, part Shepard, but seems friendly
    enough.

                             BILLY
                      (New York accent)
              Hey, Boy.  What are you doin' here
              all alone?  C'mere.

    But the dog hangs back -- his eyes flashing in the light
    that's reflected off the water.  Somehow he knows not to
    come closer.  Somehow he knows everything.

                             BILLY
              What are you lookin' at me like that
              for?  What's wrong?  Come here.

    The dog recedes back into the darkness.

                             BILLY
              Crazy mutt...

    Then, in a moment, a car speeds past.  There's a dull thud
    as it goes.  BILLY hears a whimpering noise and gets up.
    He's blind drunk as he wanders toward the crying.  There,
    near the highway, lies the wounded dog.  It's bleeding
    like crazy, obviously a hit and run victim.  BILLY kneels
    down and scoops it up.


    INT.  HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

    BILLY bursts in, holding the wounded animal.  He's in a
    frenzy, flagging down any NURSE or DOCTOR in sight.

                             BILLY
                      (New York accent)
              Help me.  He's been hit by a car.  I
              found him by the side of the road...

                             NURSE
              Sir, you can't bring him in here --
              this is a medical hospital.  We'll
              call the veterinary hospital.

                             BILLY
              He's not gonna make it to a vet.

                             NURSE
                      (going for a phone)
              We'll send him in an ambulance.
              There's nothing we can do.

                             BILLY
                      (chasing her)
              What the fuck is wrong with you?
              He's a living creature!

                             NURSE
                      (to another)
              Call security.

                             BILLY
              Fuck security.

    A DOCTOR comes over.

                             DOCTOR
              O.K., why don't you just settle
              down.  You've had a lot to drink.

    BILLY ignores him and heads down the corridor.

                             BILLY
              Somebody help me!  Anybody!

    SECURITY GUARDS head off after him, grabbing him by the
    arms, trying to wrestle the dog away.


    INT.  BILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

    He's asleep in bed, covers pulled up to his chin.  He
    looks like he had a bad night.  His eyes pry open, one at
    a time.  It only takes a moment for him to realize
    something is wrong.  He looks down to the foot of the bed.

    ANGLE

    as BILLY slowly pulls the covers up, revealing his bare
    feet.  They're caked in mud and wet grass.  The covers
    keep pulling.  His ankles are also filthy -- and something
    more: there's a trickle of dried blood.  He keeps pulling.
    It's some grotesque true life parody of the horse's head
    in "The Godfather." BILLY is completely covered in blood.
    And he hasn't got any idea why.  He's fully dressed.


    INT.  BATHROOM

    BILLY is in a panic.  His shirt is off and he's trying to
    wash out the blood in the sink.  He scrubs it first with
    soap, then Comet and a brush.  Suddenly, FRANCINE is at
    the bathroom door, loaded down with groceries.  She stares
    in horror at what's going on.

                             BILLY
              Go away!

    He kicks the door shut in her face.

    OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM DOOR

                             FRANCINE
              Billy, what have you done?!  There's
              blood everywhere -- my God, Billy!

    The door flies open.  There's BILLY -- crazed.

                             BILLY
              Get the hell out of here and don't
              say a word to anybody.

    He goes back to scrubbing.

                             FRANCINE
                      (near hysteria)
              What's happening to you?  I wake up
              scared every day.  Billy, I don't
              know if you're gonna be sweet or act
              crazy or sit and stare at the
              wall -- and I don't know if it's my
              fault or what I did wrong.  Tell
              me -- I can fix it.  Please...

    She stumbles to the closet, and pulls out the shoebox
    while he comes into the bedroom and puts the wet shirt
    over a chair to dry.  She emerges with the .38 in hand.

                             FRANCINE
              I know you have guns, Billy.  You
              don't have to hide them.  I want to
              know where you've been getting all
              this money from?  New watches, new
              clothes -- you haven't held a job
              steady in six months!  Billy...
              Billy...

    She turns him around to face her.  His eyes are rolled up
    under his lids -- his lips going frantically.  He's
    oblivious to her as she pulls back in fear.


    INT.  SPOT

    It's empty.  Around the edges, ARTHUR, RAGEN, TOMMY,
    ALLEN, PHIL and KEVIN are in a frenzied argument.  In the
    distance, we hear FRANCINE continuing to speak to BILLY,
    trying to snap him back.

                             ARTHUR
              It's time to break this off once and
              for all.

                             ALLEN
              No.

                             TOMMY
              Where did all the blood come from?

                             RAGEN
                      (to Arthur)
              You were supposed to dominate spot.
              Is your fault.

                             ARTHUR
              I'm trying -- I can't keep control.
              The others steal time and I can't
              stop them.

                             PHIL
              So what?  Would ya listen to him?
              He thinks he shits crumpets.

                             KEVIN
                      (to Arthur)
              If we all listened to you we'd be
              sitting with our thumbs up our
              asses.

                             ARTHUR
              There must be some code, some kind
              of order.

                             RAGEN
              I agree.

                             ARTHUR
              We must re-group.  And the first
              step is to eliminate her.

                             ALLEN
              You can't.  I won't let you.

                             ARTHUR
              You've nothing to say about it.

    ADALANA comes forward.  She's nineteen, with long, stringy
    black hair.  Her eyes drift with nystagmus.  She has a
    pathetic kind of gravity that shuts the others up.

                             ADALANA
              It's not fair.  You can't shut out
              the only love we have.  No one else
              touches us.  Feelings matter more
              than staying in control.  They
              matter more than anything.

                             PHIL
              Shut up.

                             ADALANA
              Without love we'll die.

    Behind her, we can see TOMMY has gotten into the SPOT and
    picked up the gun, which he now holds to his head and
    cocks.  The others don't notice.


    INT.  BEDROOM

    As FRANCINE watches in fear.  BILLY holds the cocked .38
    to his head.

                             FRANCINE
              Billy... Billy, come on...

    He twirls it on his finger and puts the barrel in his
    mouth.

                             FRANCINE
              Billy... you're scaring me...

    In one swift move, he aims and shoots out a lamp,
    darkening the room to an eerie glow.  FRANCINE screams as
    the bullet leaves a hole in the wall.


    INT.  SPOT

    As the others argue.  RAGEN grabs the gun from TOMMY and
    takes the spot.

                             RAGEN
              You know rules!  Only I touch guns!


    INT.  BEDROOM

    BILLY angrily slaps the gun down on the desk.  He turns
    and paces as he rants:

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              Things have gone too far.  I take
              control from now on.
                      (English accent)
              No, that's not the solution...

    FRANCINE takes this opportunity to grab the .38 and run
    out of the apartment.  BILLY realizes and chases after
    her.


    INT.  STAIRWAY

    FRANCINE a flight ahead of BILLY, running for her life.


    EXT.  STREET

    FRANCINE gets in her car and is frantically hitting all
    the buttons to lock the four doors as BILLY reaches her.
    He looks inhuman -- a maniac.  He's carrying a screwdriver
    and banging on the driver's side window with it, chipping
    the glass.  She turns the key and starts to pull away from
    the curb, but BILLY jumps on the hood and starts
    frantically puncturing the windshield with the
    screwdriver.  Shards of glass fly into the car, whizzing
    past her face, cutting her forehead and cheek.

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              Give me the gun!  Give me the gun!

    Terrified, she stops the car, opens the window just wide
    enough to fit the gun through.  He grabs it and she
    immediately rolls the window back up.  He jumps off the
    hood and stalks his way back inside as FRANCINE burst into
    tears.


    INT.  AIRPLANE IN FLIGHT

    A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN talks to BILLY, who sits next to her.

                             WOMAN
              Fifty four years old, my first time
              on a plane... can you believe it?
              My daughter finally got me a ticket.
              She says let me do something for
              you.  I said if you really wanna do
              something for me, stop seeing that
              musician who gave your dog angina.
              The truth.  He played that damn
              guitar so loud, he killed the dog.
              If I gave you her number, would you
              call her?  I'm gonna write it down.
                      (and she does)
              Is this you first time going to
              England?

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              Madam, it's my home.


    EXT.  OUTSIDE THE GATES OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE

    ARTHUR is in his glory.  BILLY wears a suit and bowler
    hat, and carries an umbrella.

    IN FRONT OF BIG BEN

    BILLY checks his vest pocket watch against the huge clock.

    BILLY

    crossing Abbey Road.  He takes his shoes off first,
    reproducing the album cover.

    BILLY

    coming out of a fish & chips shop -- happily munching
    away.  He passes a BUSINESSMAN in a suit.  Next to him,
    it's painfully clear how removed from reality ARTHUR'S
    cliched vision of a proper Englishman is.

                             BILLY
                      (greets him)
              Cheerio, wot.

    The BUSINESSMAN gives an odd look to this antiquated
    stranger as he passes.


    INT.  PUB - NIGHT

    It's noisy and crowded.  BILLY has a cream tea and is
    sitting at a table, expounding to the several uninterested
    people crammed onto his banquette.

                             BILLY
                      (as Arthur)
              The decline of the empire can be
              directly linked to disastrous labor
              policies since the war.  Misguided
              attempts to withdraw from
              colonization in Africa left a void
              not only economically, but in the
              national psyche.  We must bring the
              conservatives back to power
              immediately.

    The only person even looking at him is a PUNK with
    "EXPLOITED" tattooed across his forehead and spiked, black
    hair.  BILLY looks down his nose at him.

                             BILLY
              I've obviously returned just in
              time.


    EXT.  WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - NIGHT

    BILLY, alone in the lamplight, crossing the Thames with
    the city lit up behind him.  He is reciting Wordsworth's
    poem as he goes.

                             BILLY
              Earth has not anything to show more fair
              Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
              A sight so touching in its majesty
              The city now doth, like a garment, wear
              The beauty of the morning...

    It's the middle of the night.

                             BILLY
              Well...

    He stops and takes his return airplane ticket from his
    pocket, looks at it a moment, then tears it into a dozen
    pieces.  He lets them scatter over the water like
    confetti.


    INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

    BILLY wakes up wearing pajamas in a Hampstead bed and
    breakfast.  He doesn't know where he is.  The bed is
    strange.  The room is strange.  Panicked, he goes to the
    window and looks out: double decker buses, big black
    taxicabs, all driving on the wrong side of the street.  He
    turns back to the room, sweating now.  He sees a suitcase
    and lurches for it.  He pulls out unfamiliar clothes,
    toiletries.  He finds his wallet.  It's filled with
    strange, colored money.  Then he sees a passport he
    doesn't remember obtaining.  The picture has him in a suit
    and a bowler.  He notices a United Airlines ticket
    envelope on the night table and opens it.  It's empty.
    He's verging on hysteria now as he runs out into the
    hallway and down a narrow flight of stairs, where he
    passes the PROPRIETOR.

                             PROPRIETOR
              Bit of breakfast, then, gov'ner?
              It's included...

    But BILLY just tears past him, out the front door and into
    the street.  He paces the sidewalk, terrified and angry at
    the same time, ranting to no one.

                             BILLY
              What's going on?  What the hell am I
              doing here?  What's wrong with me?

    He falls down to his knees, tears streaming down now, and
    beats his fists into the curb.

                             BILLY
              What's wrong with me?  I want to
              die... please, God, let me die...


    INT.  GOVERNMENTAL OFFICE - ENGLAND

    A UNIFORMED IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL is stamping BILLY'S
    certificate of deportation.  As a conversation goes on
    around him, BILLY zones out -- lost in thought.

                             FIRST OFFICIAL
              No passport, no money, no ticket
              home...

                             SECOND OFFICIAL
              That's not clever, is it?

                             FIRST OFFICIAL
              Bloody Americans -- think they own
              the world.

    PRESS IN ON BILLY

    We hear a FEMALE VOICE inside his head.  It's insinuating,
    manipulative.

                             APRIL (V.O.)
              It's all your fault.  Everything.
              Our whole life is ruined and it's
              all because of him.  He has to pay
              for what he's done to us.  He has to
              die.  There are ways.  Things we can
              do to him...


    INT.  CORN CRIB

    The one at the farm.  CHALMER is tied, shirtless, to a
    chair.  A lit blowtorch enter frame and comes straight at
    him.  CHALMER screams.

    ANGLE

    APRIL nineteen, long hair, big, crazy eyes.  She has the
    blowtorch.


    INT.  PLANE

    BILLY heading home from England.  A UNIFORMED OFFICER sits
    beside him, but he's staring off.

                             APRIL (V.O.)
              We could burn his body -- bit by
              bit -- so he'd never be able to hurt
              anyone again.  The heat would
              cauterize his wounds as we went, so
              there would be no blood.


    INT.  CORN CRIB

    APRIL is force feeding CHALMER pills.

                             APRIL (V.O.)
              We'd keep him awake with
              amphetamines, so that he'd suffer
              here on Earth -- before he went to
              hell.


    INT.  AIRPLANE

    BILLY is so intense by now, that the UNIFORMED OFFICER is
    looking at him funny.


    INT.  SPOT

    From the near darkness, APRIL whispers into RAGEN'S ear --
    like the snake convincing Eve to bite the apple.

                             APRIL
              Don't forget what he did to the
              children.  To Christene... He has to
              be stopped.  He has to die.


    EXT.  WOODS - DAY

    BILLY has a telescope, which he's taking apart.  He pulls
    two hairs from his head and carefully wets them to the
    inside of the eyepiece, which he's removed from the
    telescope.  He looks through it -- then glues the cross
    hairs in place.  He swigs from a bottle of Stoli.


    INT.  CHALMER MILLIGAN'S HOUSE

    CHALMER MILLIGAN is getting ready for work: putting a
    large key ring on his belt, etc.  Of course, he's thirteen
    years older then we've last seen him.  He walks into the
    front hall, but, as he passes the mirror, a light flashes
    in the reflection, it blinds him for a split second.  He
    doesn't think much about it and goes for the hall closet
    door.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    The flash of light.  It comes from the sun hitting the
    homemade telescopic sight that BILLY has mounted onto a
    carbine.  He's hiding behind a tree across the road, with
    the weapon aimed straight for CHALMER'S front door.


    INT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER puts on his jacket, then his hat.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    BILLY watching and waiting.


    INT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER, ready to go, reaches for the doorknob.


    EXT.  HOUSE - BILLY'S POV

    The doorknob turns.

    BILLY

    starts to pull the trigger.

    THE DOORKNOB

    stops turning.


    INT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER, his hand still on the doorknob, realizes he's
    forgotten something.  He leaves the frame.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    BILLY suspended, waiting.  A car passes from out of
    nowhere.  The DRIVER looks over in BILLY'S direction.
    BILLY ducks behind a tree before he's seen.  His eyes half
    close.  His lips move.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN in the light, holding the carbine.  ARTHUR emerges
    from the darkness.

                             ARTHUR
              What are you doing?


    INT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER, in his bedroom, retrieves his wallet from a
    dresser and leaves the room.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN aiming the rifle once more, while ARTHUR pleads with
    him.

                             ARTHUR
              You can't kill him.  They'll send us
              to jail -- including the children.
              How do you expect them to survive in
              prison?

                             RAGEN
              I will protect them.  He must be
              stopped so he can never hurt
              children again.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    BILLY, carbine poised, still lost inside himself and
    muttering.


    INT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER re-entering the front hall.


    INT.  SPOT

                             ARTHUR
              Killing is wrong.  We only protect
              ourselves if we are threatened.

    APRIL emerges.

                             APRIL
              What about what he did to us?  We'll
              never be able to get on with our
              lives as long as we know he's
              somewhere out there.  We'll never
              feel safe.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    The doorknob is turning once again.

    BILLY

    aiming -- the scope pressed so tight against him, it
    makes a deep, red imprint.

                             ARTHUR (V.O.)
              Ragen...


    INT.  SPOT

    ARTHUR has brought out CHRISTENE.

                             CHRISTENE
              Please don't hurt him.

    RAGEN looks over.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    BILLY, sweating, his eye a couple of inched from the
    eyepiece now.

    FLASHBACK - VERY FAST

    BILLY, age eight, tied to a door that's been taken off its
    hinges and laid across two saw horses.  CHALMER'S standing
    over him with a knife and a cat.  He lifts them out of
    frame above BILLY'S naked chest.  BILLY begins vomiting,
    but because of his supine position, he chokes.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    BILLY still sweating.

    THE DOOR OPENS

    The angle is such that we can't see CHALMER yet.
    Suddenly, he emerges.

    TIGHT ON BILLY

    the trigger is slick with sweat.

    FLASHBACK - VERY FAST

    The Farm.  From behind, we see CHALMER is taking a leak.
    Once he walks away, we see that he's actually been
    urinating into the pipe that sticks up from the ground.

    THE PRESENT - CHALMER

    shutting and locking the door behind him.


    INT.  SPOT

    CHRISTENE has come right up to RAGEN.  She's crying.

                             CHRISTENE
              Ragen, I'm scared.  I don't want
              anymore nightmares.

                             ARTHUR
              If we kill him, then they were all
              right.  We're crazy.  And we will
              never get better.

    RAGEN looks at CHRISTENE.

                             CHRISTENE
                      (through tears)
              Please...

    He looks at APRIL -- a woman possessed with hatred.


    EXT.  HOUSE

    CHALMER turns back from locking the door and comes down
    the walk.

    CHALMER

    in BILLY'S crosshairs.

    BILLY

    Rifle poised.

    CHALMER

    suddenly looks up and straight at the lens.

    BILLY'S FINGER

    squeezes the trigger.

    A SHOT RINGS OUT.

    CHALMER

    still alive, looks over.

    LEAVES

    scatter from the treetop.

    BILLY

    leaning against the far side if the tree -- the
    carbine pointing straight up -- as leaves fall around him.
    He is hyper-ventilating.

    CHALMER

    takes off in his car -- driving right past BILLY,
    but never seeing him.

    THE SPOT

    CHRISTENE hugging RAGEN as ARTHUR looks on and APRIL
    slinks back into darkness.

    THE PAINTING

    of DANNY with CHALMER looming over him.

    BILLY - IN HIS APARTMENT

    obliterates CHALMER with his hands, as we had seen
    earlier, and starts to re-do the background in dark blue.
    This is the first time since the rapes that we've seen him
    wearing a full moustache.

    BILLY

    at his mailbox.  The blue paint still on his fingers.

    BILLY'S MAILBOX

    as he pulls out an envelope.  Inside is an eviction notice
    for non-payment of rent.  He crumples it angrily.

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              The money is gone.  The bills have
              not been paid.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN rants.

                             RAGEN
              The trip to London leaves us broke.
              Now we are evicted.  Something must
              be done.

    PHIL and KEVIN approaches him.

                             PHIL
              We can't hold a job.  We can't count
              on Billy to do anything.  We're
              starving.  There's only one way for
              us to make any money.

    KEVIN holds out a pistol to RAGEN.

                             KEVIN
              You don't have to hurt anyone --
              just force some guy to cash a check.

    In the shadows, CHRISTENE is standing, holding her rag
    doll.  Her big blue eyes starting to dim.

                             CHRISTENE
              I'm hungry.

    RAGEN looks at her, his heart full.  He picks her up and
    cradles her in his arms.  This is the inspiration for the
    painting of them we saw earlier.


    INT.  APARTMENT

    BILLY, standing there, cradling thin air, gently rocking
    back and forth.  His gun is in the waistband of his pants.


    EXT.  ROAD

    BILLY is jogging, wearing the same outfit he had on during
    the rapes.


    EXT.  PARKING LOT

    The same lot on the Ohio State campus where we saw BILLY
    abduct the women.  BILLY swigs from a bottle of vodka.
    He's wearing dark brown tinted sunglasses.

    INTERCUT

    between BILLY and various students, teachers, etc., both
    male and female.  He has no plan.  He's just looking for
    someone to rob.  He sees a young woman park a gold Toyota.
    She gets out of the car -- it is DONNA WEST.  BILLY turns
    away to look elsewhere.

                             BILLY
                      (Ragen's accent)
              I do not rob womans.

    A beat.  Behind his glasses, BILLY "blinks."

    WE PRESS IN ON HIM

    as he suddenly turns back toward DONNA WEST.


    INT.  SPOT

    In the semi-darkness, RAGEN is passed out, cradling his
    empty bottle of vodka.

    WE PAN OVER

    so that we're staring straight into the spotlight.  It
    blinds us.  A hand raises the gun into frame.


    EXT.  PARKING LOT

    DONNA WEST is leaning in through the passenger seat
    window, when the gun enters frame and presses against her
    arm.

    WE PULL UP

    to reveal not BILLY, but ADALANA holding it.

                             ADALANA
              Would you please get in the car?

    Terrified, DONNA gets in the car.  ADALANA walks around to
    the driver's side and gets in.


    INT.  CAR

    Instead of ADALANA sitting down behind the wheel, KEVIN
    does.  He cuffs DONNA to the door and pulls her car keys
    from her bag.


    EXT.  CAR

    As it pulls away from the curb.


    INT.  SPOT

    ADALANA is upset and confused in the dark periphery of the
    spot.  In the actual light sits KEVIN at the wheel of the
    car.

                             DONNA (O.C.)
              Where are we going?

    ADALANA clenches her eyes shut.


    INT.  CAR

    ANGLE

    on DONNA WEST.

                             DONNA
              I know this is gonna sound
              ridiculous, but I have an optometry
              test today.

    ANGLE

    as ADALANA is suddenly sitting there.  She looks at DONNA.

                             ADALANA
              You can study for it if you want.
              This won't take long.  Go on.


    INT.  SPOT

    ALLEN, visible in the dark, obviously upset, cigarette in
    hand.

                             ALLEN
              What's going on?  Does Arthur know
              about this?


    INT.  CAR

    DONNA picks up a text book with her trembling free hand
    and feigns studying.  ADALANA behind the wheel.


    EXT.  ROAD

    As the car drives through a deserted stretch of
    countryside.


    INT.  CAR

    DONNA is "studying", stealing glances at her abductor.
    Suddenly:

    ANGLE

    KEVIN grabs her bag and pulls out her address book.  As he
    rips out pages:

                             KEVIN
              I'm taking these addresses and phone
              numbers.  If you say anything to the
              police, I'll send someone from my
              brotherhood after you.


    EXT.  COLUMBUS STREET

    BILLY "comes to" as RAGEN but we see BILLY'S body.  He's
    still dressed the same way.  He is confused, as usual,
    standing in front of a grocery store.


    INT.  GROCERY STORE - DAY

    BILLY, still dressed the same way, is paying for a large
    bag of groceries with a thick wad of bills.  Behind him,
    TWO WOMEN talk.

                             FIRST WOMAN
              Kidnapped her right out of the
              parking lot.

                             SECOND WOMAN
              My God.  Black fella or white?

                             FIRST WOMAN
              Black, I think.

                             CASHIER
              My daughter goes to that school.

                             BILLY
                      (Ragen's accent)
              Thank you.

    BILLY leaves, oblivious.


    INT.  BILLY'S KITCHEN

    He still has his moustache as he loads the refrigerator
    full of groceries and shuts the door, then leaves frame.
    A beat.  He returns and opens the refrigerator.  It's
    empty.  He grabs his wallet -- it's empty.  He touches his
    face -- he is completely clean shaven.


    INT.  SPOT

    ALLEN arguing with PHIL and KEVIN.  In the B.G., ADALANA
    controls the spot -- sitting behind the wheel of a
    different car.

                             PHIL
              Shut up, faggot.

                             KEVIN
              Yeah.  Go paint a picture.

                             ALLEN
              This is a bad mix-up time.  Arthur
              should be controlling the spot.  Or
              Ragen if you're going to rob
              somebody.  Where is Ragen?


    INT.  SPOT

    ADALANA behind the wheel.  PHILIP watching.


    INT.  CAR

    BILLY is driving through the woods.  Handcuffed to the
    passenger door is CARRIE DRYER.  BILLY is muttering to
    himself, wearing sunglasses.


    EXT.  CAR

    As it bumps over train tracks.


    INT.  CAR

    The jostling has made PHILIP appear in the car.  He turns
    on CARRIE.

                             PHIL
              Take off your pants.

                             CARRIE
              What?

                             PHIL
              Take your fucking pants off!

    She does the best she can with one hand.

                             PHIL
              You won't run away without any pants
              on.


    INT.  SPOT

    ADALANA pleading with PHILIP from outside the spotlight.

                             ADALANA
              Don't hurt her.

                             KEVIN
                      (comes up behind her)
              Shut up.

                             ADALANA
              I have to hold the spot.  Please.

                             KEVIN
              Fuck you.

    ADALANA clenches her eyes shut.


    EXT.  WOODS

    The car is parked.  BILLY and CARRIE stand beside it --
    she is in a blouse and underwear.

                             BILLY
                      (gently)
              Are you cold?

    She shakes her hear "no".  BILLY lays CARRIE'S buckskin
    jacket down on the muddy ground.

                             BILLY
                      (awkwardly, not
                       looking at her)
              Take off your underwear and lay
              down.

    CARRIE dissolves in tears.


    INT.  SPOT

    PHIL and KEVIN looking at ADALANA, who is lit by the
    spotlight.

                             PHIL
              That fucking bitch.


    INT.  BILLY'S BEDROOM

    Reality.  A jarring switch.  BILLY is in a frenzy.  He's
    ripping his wallet to shreds -- it's empty again.  He
    throws it across the room, breaking a vase.  Then he sees
    the cellophane bag full of pills and grabs it.

                             BILLY
                      (Slavic accent)
              Dammit!  Someone is spending all
              money on drugs!  Arthur!


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN, alone, ranting.

                             RAGEN
              Arthur!


    INT.  BATHROOM

    As BILLY empties the pills into the toilet and flushes.
    He looks up into the mirror -- and sees RAGEN'S
    reflection.


    EXT.  WOODS

    POLLY NEWTON and BILLY are sitting on the ground.  He's
    wearing his sunglasses.  She's naked from the waist down.
    He has a pencil and paper in his hand and is reading to
    her.

                             BILLY
              Hope is the thing with feathers
              That perches in the soul
              And sings the tune without the words
              And never stops at all
              And sweetest in the gale is heard
              And sore must be the storm
              That could abash the little bird
              That kept so many warm
              I've heard it in the chilliest land
              And on the strangest sea
              Yet never in extremity
              It asked a crumb of me

              I can't let you have it.  The police
              could trace my handwriting.

    He crumples it up and stuffs the pieces in his pocket.

    ANGLE

    POLLY is lying on her back -- cold and frightened.  As she
    speaks, ADALANA enters frame and lies next to her.

                             ADALANA
              Do you know what it's like to be
              lonely?  Not to be held by anyone?
              Not to know the meaning of love?

    She takes off her sunglasses.  Her eyes drift to the side
    and dart back to center.  She rolls on top of POLLY and
    kisses her.


    INT.  SPOT - QUICK, SILENT CUTS

    RAGEN passed out.

    ANGLE

    ARTHUR, also asleep.

    ANGLE

    CHRISTENE, sleeping, sucking her thumb.


    EXT.  WOODS

    ADALANA on top of CARRIE DRYER.


    INT.  SPOT

    ALLEN watching, crying.

    ANGLE

    PHILIP and KEVIN watching, annoyed.


    EXT.  WOODS

    ADALANA on top of DONNA WEST.


    INT.  SPOT

    ADALANA in the light -- just her face.  Tears roll down
    her cheeks.

                             ADALANA
              I'm sorry we had to meet under these
              circumstances.  I really love you.

    She puts on her sunglasses.

    WE PAN SLOWLY AROUND

    into the shadows, until we finally come to BILLY -- lying
    on a bed of darkness -- fast asleep -- as he has been the
    past seven years.


    INT.  SPOT

    PHILIP and KEVIN.

                             PHIL
              Alright, that's enough.  Let's get
              the check cashed.


    INT.  CAR

    POLLY in the passenger seat as they drive -- but suddenly,
    TOMMY finds himself behind the wheel.  He looks over --
    total confusion.

                             TOMMY
              What the fuck?


    INT.  WENDY'S

    TOMMY and POLLY having burgers and shakes.  She's
    completely freaked out.  He assumes he's on a date.

                             TOMMY
              So, I apologize for forgettin' your
              name -- I haven't been out on a date
              in a while... you have enough food?
              You want somethin' else?

    TOMMY "blinks."

    ANGLE

    Now PHILIP is there.  He looks around -- annoyed at where
    they are.

                             PHIL
                      (getting up, grabbing
                       her hand)
              Come on.


    INT.  CAR

    PHILIP and POLLY leaving the drive-thru window at the bank
    with a fresh wad of cash.


    INT.  BILLY'S APARTMENT

    DANNY, age eight, is building with a set of Leggos.  He's
    very determined -- as focused and concentrated as BILLY is
    while painting.  The doorbell rings.  He answers it.  The
    COP is there, dressed in a Domino's Pizza uniform, holding
    a pizza.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              You Billy Milligan?

                             DANNY
              Who?


    INT.  LIVING ROOM

    As instant replay of the earlier scene: COPS swarming the
    place -- the YOUNG OFFICER using DANNY for a shield.  ONE
    COP steps on DANNY'S Leggo fort -- crushing it.

                             YOUNG OFFICER
              Where are they?

                             DANNY
              Who?  There's no one here.


    INT.  CELL

    CHRISTENE sits in the middle of the floor drawing a
    picture.  TWO GUARDS are there.

                             SECOND GUARD
              They sent you down some Kool-Aid.
              You want it?

    CHRISTENE looks up.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Is that a no?

    CHRISTENE gets up, reaches for the cup, the GUARD grabs
    her wrist.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Hey, you think we oughta tattoo this
              Jew Boy?

                             FIRST GUARD
              Yeah.  Put some numbers right there.

    CHRISTENE pulls her arm free as the GUARDS laugh.

                             SECOND GUARD
              Here ya go, Rembrandt.

    He throws the drink -- ruining the picture.

    ANGLE

    as RAGEN rises into the frame -- fire in his eyes.  He
    walks over to the toilet bowl, squats and grabs hold of
    it.

    THE BARS

    as the toilet crashes against them, exploding to
    smithereens.  The shards cut the GUARD'S faces to ribbons.

    SIX GUARDS

    beating RAGEN and putting him into a straitjacket.


    INT.  ISOLATION CELL

    TOMMY in a straitjacket.  He pops his shoulder out of its
    socket, dislocating it, and slips free.


    INT.  ISOLATION CELL - LATER

    CHRISTENE, asleep using the straitjacket for a pillow and
    sucking her thumb, as we hear the approaching guard:

                             GUARD (O.C.)
              O.K. rapist, chow time.  We all
              took turns spitting on your food
              before I brought it down, but you
              can ignore that, can't ya?  just
              pretend it's soup...

    Light spills in from the corridor.

                             GUARD
              Jesus H. Christ...


    INT.  SPOT

    SHAWN sits in the near dark, making a heart inscribed
    "Happy Valentine's Day."

    PULL BACK

    to reveal RAGEN and ARTHUR talking nearby.

                             RAGEN
              February 14th.  Is twenty first
              birthday.  I think it is time to
              wake him.

                             ARTHUR
              Absolutely not.  He can't handle it.

                             RAGEN
              In jail I control spot.  Is time.


    INT.  CELL

    BILLY is there now.  We haven't seen him for a long time.
    He is confused and disoriented.


    INT.  SPOT

    As RAGEN, ARTHUR, TOMMY and ALLEN watch BILLY, who is in
    the light.

                             BILLY
              I thought I was dead.  I though...

    FLASHBACK

    BILLY heading for the edge of Lancaster High School roof
    at fourteen.

    SAME THING FROM BILLY'S POV

    The ground looks very far away.


    INT.  CELL

    BILLY looks at his body.  It can't be his.  He sees the
    bars.  The cot.  He starts breathing faster.  He sees a
    shiny piece of steel bolted into one wall, which serves as
    a mirror.  His knees are weak as he gets up and walks
    towards it.


    INT.  MIRROR

    He gets near enough to look at his reflection.  Almost
    immediately, he is reduced to utter panic.

    Everything goes crazy.  QUICK CUTS.  No reality.

    BILLY'S HAND

    as it springs to his mouth to stifle a scream -- but the
    hand is an adult's not the teenager's that he expects.

    TIGHT

    on ALLEN'S FACE against blackness.

    TIGHT

    on TOMMY'S FACE against blackness.

    BILLY

    looking in the mirror, touching his stubble.  His thinning
    hair.  He cries out.

    ANGLE

    on the cell.  BILLY is talking in ARTHUR'S English accent.

                             BILLY
              My God -- sweet Jesus Christ.

    FAST CUT

    BILLY, in the cell, whirls around and hits the sinks with
    his clenched fist.  It shatters into a million pieces.
    Water sprays everywhere.  His hand is a bloody stump.


    INT.  SPOT

    RAGEN, in the light, sweating buckets.  His clenched fist
    drips red.

    BILLY

    in the cell.

                             BILLY
                      (an anguished cry)
              What's happening?!!


    INT.  SPOT

    CHRISTENE in the spotlight, happily holding her hand in
    the torrent of water -- splashing and playing.


    INT.  CELL

    BILLY has his hand in the middle of the spray, as
    CHRISTENE did.


    INT.  CELL - QUICK CUT

    BILLY grabbing one of the porcelain shards from the floor.

    BILLY'S WRIST

    as he slashes it lengthwise.

    TIGHT

    on ARTHUR'S FACE against blackness.

    TIGHT

    on ADALANA'S FACE against blackness.


    INT.  CELL

    As BILLY passes out, landing on top of his arm.  He's in a
    pool of blood and foam and porcelain.

    TIGHT

    on CHRISTENE'S FACE against blackness.  She loses
    consciousness.

    ALLEN

    against blackness.  Confused, he loses consciousness as
    well.


    INT.  SPOT

    It's empty.  Bright light illuminating nothing.

    THE SCREEN SUDDENLY BLACKS OUT

    DANNY

    Everything is white and silent -- it's jarring after the
    tumultuousness of the last section.  He's in a hospital
    bed, completely confused.

    ANGLE

    GARY and JUDY are there with him.

                             GARY
              How ya feeling, Billy?  You were out
              for quite some time.


    INT.  EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

    Eight year old DANNY is having an EEG performed.  The
    TECHNICIAN is confused by the printout.


    INT.  EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

    The TECHNICIAN and DOCTOR are there now, looking at a
    normal printout.

                             DOCTOR
              See?  Completely normal.  Those
              electrodes are for shit.

                             TECHNICIAN
              But I didn't change the electrodes.
              I had to order it.

    WE PAN AROUND

    to see that ARTHUR is now hooked up to the EEG.


    INT.  ROOM - DAY

    Harding Hospital, as DR. HARDING watches through the
    peephole.  APRIL sits on the floor, drawing a tombstone
    that reads DO NOT R.I.P.

    TIGHT ON JUDGE

                             JUDGE
              Lacking any evidence to the
              contrary, this court has no
              alternative than to find the
              defendant not guilty by reason of
              insanity.

    He raps his gravel three times.


    EXT.  ATHENS MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - DAY

    Establishing shot.


    EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

    It's on the grounds at Athens.  Several months have
    passed.  BILLY sits alone in the grass.  We are some
    distance away.  He has a half finished canvas and a
    paintbrush that hangs limply in his right hand.

    ANGLE

    closer as ROSALIE DRAKE, a nurse, approaches and sits next
    to him.

                             ROSALIE
              You're awfully quiet today, Allen.
              I almost thought it was Danny
              sitting out here, till I saw the
              brush in your right hand.  Allen?

    BILLY turns his head toward ROSALIE.  Her eyes well up.

                             ROSALIE
              Oh my God.

                             BILLY
              I'm Billy.


    INT.  DR. CAUL'S OFFICE

    DR. CAUL is there, alone, with BILLY.  BILLY seems stable,
    self-possessed.

                             CAUL
              Good afternoon, Billy.  How are you
              feeling today?

                             BILLY
              Fine, thanks, Dr. Caul.  How are
              you?

                             CAUL
              I'm just fine.  Now, you've been
              responding so well to the Amitol,
              that I've talked with Arthur and
              Ragen and the others, and we all
              feel that you're ready for this.

                             BILLY
              Yes.

                             CAUL
              Alright then.

    ANGLE

    to reveal a VCR and monitor.  DR. CAUL presses play and
    we:

    INTERCUT

    between BILLY'S reaction and the screen.  His emotions run
    the gamut as he watches.

    THE MONITOR

    BILLY sitting in the very same room with DR. CAUL.  They
    wear the same outfits.  BILLY'S knees are jiggling.


    INT.  OFFICE

    BILLY notices his own knees are jiggling and stops them.

    THE MONITOR

    BILLY, eyes half closed, lips moving silently.  And
    suddenly, he's back, with all the facial and physical
    characteristics we've come to recognize as RAGEN.

                             BILLY
              You have made quite a few enemies,
              Dr. Caul.  I'm not one of your
              enemies, at the moment.  It is
              Arthur.

                             DR. CAUL
              Why?

                             BILLY
              The things that Arthur was keeping
              secret was exposed, the other day.
              There was penetration by the
              undesirables.

                             DR. CAUL
              Explain the undesirables.  We need
              to understand that.

                             BILLY
              The undesirables are people who was
              silenced by Arthur because their
              functions were no longer necessary --
              um -- for a multitude of reasons
              they were silenced.

                             DR. CAUL
              Then why are they still around?

                             BILLY
              What do you want us to do?  Murder
              them?

    As he continues, we PRESS IN on BILLY, watching himself --
    face to face with this locked door thrown open for the
    first time.

    THE MONITOR - TIME CUT - INTERCUT WITH BILLY WATCHING

    Now it's the TOMMY personality.

                             BILLY
              It gets frustratin' 'cause people
              keep callin' ya Billy and you don't
              pay attention and then, finally,
              you're like: oh yeah, I'm Billy.
              But I'm not Billy.  I'm Tommy.

    THE MONITOR - TIME CUT - INTERCUT WITH BILLY WATCHING

    It's now the ARTHUR personality.

                             DR. CAUL (O.C.)
                      (on tape)
              How did you learn Arabic?  How did
              Ragen learn Serbo-Croation?  Or
              Tommy electronics and escape
              artistry...?

                             BILLY
                      (English accent)
              Different ways.  Books.  The
              library.  By doing.  Everyone has a
              special job, special abilities --
              and it is each person's
              responsibility to develop them.

    THE MONITOR - TIME CUT - INTERCUT WITH BILLY WATCHING

    ALLEN smoking.

                             DR. CAUL (O.C.)
                      (in room)
              That's Allen.  He's the only one who
              smokes.  He's also the only one
              who's right handed.  At the time of
              the trial, we thought there were
              only ten of you, because Arthur had
              already banished the undesirables by
              that point.

                             BILLY
              Yeah.  Philip, Kevin, April,
              Adalana -- he kicked a whole bunch
              out when everything happened.

                             DR. CAUL
              So then, how many of you are there
              all together?

                             BILLY
              Twenty three.

                             DR. CAUL
              Twenty three.  Plus Billy?

                             BILLY
              Plus Billy.

    THE MONITOR - TIME CUT - INTERCUT WITH BILLY WATCHING

                             DR. CAUL (O.C.)
                      (on tape)
              What about Adalana?  She's a female.

                             BILLY
                      (as Arthur)
              You must understand that Billy
              associates any type of male
              sexuality with abuse and torture.
              Just as Tommy can get out of ropes
              and Ragen can protect himself
              physically.  Adalana was created to
              make and seek love.


    INT.  THE ROOM

    BILLY watching the monitor -- tears form.

    THE MONITOR

    It's the ADALANA personality -- meek, teary, nystagmatic.

    TV ANCHORWOMAN

    on the 6:00 news.

                             ANCHORWOMAN
              In the ten months he's been at the
              Athens Mental Health Center, campus
              rapist Billy Milligan has been
              described by doctors as a model
              patient who has made enormous
              progress and even started the
              Foundation Against Child Abuse with
              money earned from the sale of his
              paintings.  But there is a new
              controversy swirling around him
              today.


    EXT.  STEPS OF FRANKLIN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

    It's a mob scene -- hordes of protesters, mostly women,
    are screaming and chanting anti-rape slogans.  A SPEAKER
    quiets them.  A LEGEND identifies the speaker as State
    Representative Dick Molinaro.

                             MOLINARO
              It has come to our attention that
              Billy Milligan's doctors have been
              letting him take unsupervised trips
              from the hospital into town as part
              of his therapy.  This is completely
              unacceptable!  I have today called
              Judge Kinworthy to sign a court
              order sending Milligan away to the
              maximum security facility at Lima,
              where he'll never again be allowed
              to roam freely in the community!


    INT.  GARY SCHWEICKART'S KITCHEN

    He is watching the news while eating dinner with his
    family.  This has taken him completely by surprise.

                             GARY
              What?!


    INT.  DR. CAUL'S OFFICE - DAY

    DR. CAUL and GARY.

                             GARY
              Is it true?  Have you been letting
              him out of the hospital?

                             DR. CAUL
              Yes.

                             GARY
              Alone?

                             DR. CAUL
              He has a treatable illness, Mr.
              Schweickart.  And ultimately, the
              point of any treatment is to make
              the patient well enough to be
              discharged.

                             GARY
              But is he ready?

                             DR. CAUL
              Yes.  He's met all of his
              personalities and is finally
              becoming one Billy.  He's no longer
              a danger to himself or anybody else.
              And you can take that to the bank.

                             GARY
              Where is he now?

                             DR. CAUL
              Upstairs.  But it's crucial he not
              be sent to Lima.  It's a snake pit.
              He'll revert completely.  All the
              work we've done here will be lost.

                             GARY
              It's an election year.  This
              Molinaro guy has 'em all whipped up
              into a frenzy.  The National
              Organization of Women, the National
              Lesbian Coalition...

                             DR. CAUL
              A little boy is repeatedly sodomized
              and tortured for a period of years.
              In order to survive, he fragments
              his personality -- because he is
              trying desperately to gain some kind
              of control over what for him is an
              unfathomable situation.  That's a
              basic human response, Mr.
              Schweickart.  No matter how unusual
              the route he chose, since the dawn
              of time, when man can't control his
              reality, he makes up someone who
              can.  It's why we created God.
              Ragen, Arthur, Adalana -- they were
              Billy's God's -- and, like God, they
              demanded terrible sacrifices. He
              couldn't stop worshiping them when
              they demanded he break the law.


    INT.  DAY ROOM

    At Athens.  A NURSE sits reading the Columbus Dispatch.
    BILLY is front page news.  An AIDE pops his head in,
    starting her.

                             AIDE
              I'm grabbing some lunch.  You have
              to babysit.

    He leads BILLY in.

                             AIDE
              See you in an hour.

                             NURSE
                      (terrified to be
                       alone with him)
              But...

    The AIDE is gone.  BILLY looks broken, a little boy.  The
    NURSE, however, is trembling so much that a lock of hair
    on her forehead is vibrating.  Suddenly, GARY enters.  The
    NURSE gasps.

                             GARY
              Sorry.

                             NURSE
              You startled me.

                             GARY
              I'm Billy's defense attorney.  Dr.
              Caul said it'd be alright if I
              talked to him alone...

    Before the words are out of his mouth, she has bolted.

                             GARY
              ... for awhile.  Hey, Billy.

    BILLY looks up.

                             GARY
              Long time no see.

                             BILLY
              I'm sorry.  I don't know who
              you are.

    And in that moment it all truly crystallizes for GARY for
    the first time -- just what it's like to be BILLY
    MILLIGAN.  GARY smiles warmly and extends his hand.

                             GARY
              Gary Schweickart.  I'm your lawyer.
              I'm here to help.

    BILLY shakes it.


    EXT.  GRAVEYARD - DAY

    It's on the hospital grounds, but as we TRACK with GARY
    and BILLY, we see there are no names on the tombstones --
    only numbers.

                             BILLY
              I apologize.  I don't remember a lot
              of people I've met.

                             GARY
              That's O.K.  I'm meeting you now.
              This is kind of a morbid place to
              take a walk, isn't it?

                             BILLY
              This is where I come sometimes to
              try and sort things out.  When you
              don't have any family or a friend in
              the world and nobody gives a damn
              and you die here, all your records
              are destroyed.  But they keep a list
              of who's buried where so that in
              case some long, lost relative shows
              up they can say "Oh yeah, he's
              number forty one." That's what
              happens to you if you're sick.  If
              you're the black sheep.

                             GARY
              How's therapy going?

                             BILLY
              Good.  Last week in group therapy
              they had another multiple there.
              That was a crowded room.

    GARY laughs.

                             BILLY
              They're gonna send me to Lima,
              aren't they?

                             GARY
              Not necessarily.

                             BILLY
              I'll die there.

                             GARY
              There's going to be a hearing and
              you're going to get to finally tell
              your side of the story.

                             BILLY
              No one believes that I'm sick.

                             GARY
              They will.  Unless they believe that
              a little boy who was placed in a
              mental hospital when he was fourteen
              for acting like different people was
              really planning his defense eight
              years in advance.

                             BILLY
              Why are you helping me?

                             GARY
              'Cause you deserve it.


    INT.  SUBURBAN DEN - DAY

    CHALMER MILLIGAN, flanked by a lawyer, sits on his couch
    in front of a sea of microphones.

                             CHALMER
                      (referring to notes)
              I, Chalmer Milligan, have been
              accused by my adopted son, William,
              of threatening, abusing and
              sodomizing him, particularly over
              the period when he was eight or nine
              years old.  This accusation is
              completely false.  William is a
              habitual liar, and I feel that he is
              continuing a pattern of lying which
              he established many years ago.
              These accusations have caused me
              extreme embarrassment, mental
              anguish and suffering, and I make
              this statement in order to set the
              record straight and clear my good
              name.


    EXT.  ATHENS MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - DAY

    Outside the fence, a crowd of protesters are there,
    consumed with bloodlust.  They chant and throw rocks at
    the building, calling BILLY a liar and a rapist.


    INT.  DAY ROOM

    BILLY sits with JUDY STEPHENSON listening to the furor
    outside.

                             JUDY
              Don't listen to them.  They just
              believe what they read in the
              papers.

    A NURSE enters.

                             NURSE
              Billy?  You have a visitor.

    DOROTHY, BILLY'S mother, enters.

                             JUDY
              I'll wait outside.

    JUDY leaves with the NURSE.  DOROTHY sits across from
    BILLY.

                             DOROTHY
              Hello, Billy.  You look fine.
              People sure are talkin' about you.
              You're a regular celebrity.  Billy,
              I...

                             BILLY
              It's all right, Mama.  You went
              through it, too.  When I close my
              eyes and picture you -- it's with a
              bloody mouth and black eyes and half
              the hair pulled out of your head.

    She is crying.

                             BILLY
              But I can't help you with your
              guilt.  Don't ask me to.

    He takes her hand.


    INT.  CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF DAY ROOM

    DOROTHY passes JUDY on her way out.

                             JUDY
              Are you alright?  I'm Judy
              Stephenson.  I work in the Public
              Defender's office.

                             DOROTHY
              How do you do.  I'm sorry...

                             JUDY
              Don't be silly.  But Mrs. Moore, I
              wonder if I could talk to you a
              moment?

                             DOROTHY
              Yes?

                             JUDY
              The statements your ex-husband has
              made -- we have to know -- are they
              true?  Did Billy make it all up?

                             DOROTHY
              I've made my statement.  I wouldn't
              have any way of knowing the
              extent...

                             JUDY
              Please.  Off the record.

    A beat.  DOROTHY cries, then pulls her hair back,
    revealing nasty disfiguring scars.

                             DOROTHY
              This is Chalmer Milligan.  And this.
              And this.  He destroyed that little
              boy.  And I didn't stop him.

    She moves away down the hall, leaving JUDY alone.


    INT.  GARY SCHWEICKART'S BEDROOM - MORNING

    He's tightening the knot on his tie in the mirror as his
    WIFE looks on.

                             WIFE
              Wearing a suit, huh?  You must be
              worried.

                             GARY
              Piece of cake.

    But his hand isn't steady enough to do the knot.


    INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

    In GARY'S house.  As he comes out from the bedroom he
    passes his small, red-haired DAUGHTER.

                             DAUGHTER
                      (confused)
              Daddy, you match.


    INT.  FRANKLIN COUNTY COURTHOUSE

    We can hear the ever present protesters outside as GARY
    and JUDY walk briskly down a corridor to the courtroom.

                             JUDY
              See the paper this morning?  People
              believe Chalmer's story.

                             GARY
              They also once thought you could get
              the clap from toilet seats.

                             JUDY
              You can't?

    They turn a corner and walk smack into DICK MOLINARO and
    ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL BANKS, who's leading the
    prosecution.

                             MOLINARO
                      (nods)
              Gary.  Judy.

                             GARY
                      (pointedly)
              Dick.

                             MOLINARO
              You know Mr. Banks.

                             GARY
              You send him to Lima and you're
              gonna kill him.

                             BANKS
              Lima's a mental health facility, not
              death row.

                             GARY
              It's a butcher shop.  Dr. Caul
              talks about medical conditions and
              sacrificing Gods... you know what I
              see?  I see a little kid who had no
              way out, so he created a bunch of
              comic book heroes.  The Justice
              League of America.  The escape
              artist, the Yugoslavian hitman...

                             MOLINARO
              The rapist.

                             GARY
              No one wants to make him a saint --
              we just don't want to execute a guy
              who wasn't even there at the scene
              of the crimes.

                             MOLINARO
              I know you, Schweickart.  You don't
              think you're on the right side
              unless you feel like the underdog.
              Well, this time your compassion is
              misplaced.  Try thinking about the
              victims.  Try thinking about their
              families.  I'm gonna stop you, Gary.
              And I'm not gonna lose a night's
              sleep afterwards.


    INT.  COURTROOM

    The JUDGE, BANKS, MOLINARO, SCHWEICKART, JUDY STEPHENSON,
    BILLY, HIS MOTHER, A BAILIFF and A STENOGRAPHER.  BILLY is
    on the stand.

                             GARY
              Have you ever been to Lima?

                             BILLY
              Yes.  For a week.

                             GARY
              And when you were there, did you
              receive hypnotherapy?

                             BILLY
              No.

                             GARY
              Group therapy?

                             BILLY
              No.

                             GARY
              Art therapy?

                             BILLY
              No.

                             GARY
              Do you have any confidence in your
              doctor there, Dr. Milkie?

                             BILLY
              No.  He doesn't believe I'm sick.
              He gave me Stelazine.  It messed me
              up.

                             GARY
              Billy, before you were arrested and
              Dr. Caul started treating you, did
              you ever suspect that there was
              anything wrong with you?

                             BILLY
              Sure.  I knew I lost time and heard
              voices in my head, but I thought
              that happened to everybody.

                             GARY
              Didn't you think it strange that no
              one talked about it?

                             BILLY
              I was so scared and embarrassed, I
              figured everyone else was, too.
              Then, every once in a while, I'd
              hear someone say "I don't know where
              the day went" or "Did I have fun
              last night?".  I thought that was as
              close as anybody came to discussing
              it.

                             GARY
              And how do you feel now, after ten
              months at Athens?

                             BILLY
              Well, I feel whole, like I'm one
              person for the first time in my
              life.  I used to feel like a freak.
              But then I got to thinkin' -- in my
              life, I've learned to get out of
              handcuffs and straitjackets, be a
              righty or a lefty, control if I'm
              drunk or sober, talk Arabic, Hebrew,
              Yugoslavian, Japanese, learn martial
              arts, play piano and drums, make my
              eye shake, be an artist... And, I'm
              no rocket scientist... my I.Q. is
              pretty average -- so I got to
              thinkin' if I could do all that,
              then couldn't everybody?  They just
              don't know how to tap into it.  But
              if they have a brain, just like I
              have a brain -- and it's made up of
              the same muscle and stuff that mine
              is, then maybe, just maybe, if they
              went through what I went through as
              a kid, they might have split up into
              a bunch of different people like I
              did.  And then I didn't feel like
              such a freak.  I felt like someone
              who got forced to open a door
              everybody else gets to keep locked.
              I felt like that but for the grace
              of God go there.
                      (he turns to the
                       Judge)
              I don't want to hurt anybody ever
              again, your honor.  I can't get out
              of bed in the morning knowing what
              I've done.  But I want to keep
              getting better.  And I know that
              won't happen if you send me to Lima.

    on his feet -- delivering his summation.

                             BANKS
                      (reads from a book)
              Multiple Personality Disorder is a
              form of narcissism.  A willful
              disease.  Cowardly.  It is the five
              year old child with powdered sugar
              on his lips saying "I didn't eat the
              last doughnut."

    He put the book down.

                             BANKS
              You have already heard the testimony
              from his psychiatric resident at
              Lima State Hospital, Dr. Frederick
              Milkie, who, after examining the
              defendant, concluded not only that
              he did not suffer from M.P.D., but
              that in all probability, the
              disorder itself does not exist.  The
              defense has certainly offered no
              physiological evidence to the
              contrary.  Only differing
              professional opinion.  But, your
              honor, the validity of Mr.
              Milligan's psychiatric claims is not
              at issue here.  What is at issue is
              the safety of this community from a
              convicted sex offender.

                             GARY
              That's a lie.  He was acquitted.

                             BANKS
              You're absolutely right, counsel,
              and I apologize.  He was
              acquitted -- by reason of insanity.
              Insanity, your honor.  Insanity
              which made Billy Milligan strap on a
              Smith & Wesson, jog to the Ohio
              State University campus, on not one,
              not two, but three separate
              occasions, abduct a young woman,
              drive her to a secluded area in the
              woods and rape her.  And now, Dr.
              Caul and his staff want to allow
              this man, who is, by his own
              admission and by the court's edict,
              insane, to roam freely and
              unsupervised through the streets of
              this city.  Well, your honor, if
              this man is well and not serving
              very hard time, then there has been
              a gross miscarriage of justice.  But
              if he is truly insane, and not
              responsible for his actions at the
              time of the crimes, then send him to
              Lima, where this community can rest
              assured he will not be allowed to
              walk the streets and do yet more
              irreparable damage.  When you break
              a teacup, you glue it back together.
              But do you ever feel safe using it
              again?  No.  You put it away in the
              cupboard and close the door.  Your
              honor, there's a lot more at stake
              here than just being scalded by some
              hot water.

    He sits.

                             JUDY
                      (to Gary)
              Jesus Christ.

                             JUDGE
              Mr. Schweickart, are you ready with
              your summation?

    GARY gets up.

                             GARY
              Your honor, the prosecution is
              right.  There is more at stake here
              than just being scalded by some hot
              water.  There's also a hell of a lot
              more at stake than a cracked teacup.
              There's a human life.  One that's
              been robbed of every chance at
              normalcy from the age of eight by
              vicious and relentless child abuse.
              Faust made a pact with the devil.
              Well, Billy Milligan made a pact,
              too.  But he did it to survive.
              Something inside his eight year old
              mind said "I can't fight this man
              who adopts me, then rapes me.  Who
              tells me to call him Daddy, then
              buries me alive with just a metal
              pipe over my face for air.  And then
              urinates down the pipe.  I can't
              protect myself -- and neither can my
              mother.  And I'm too afraid to tell
              the police.  Or a teacher.  Because
              if I do, he'll kill me.  So I'll go
              to sleep.  And I'll let someone else
              take over my mind and my body to
              protect me.  And they can escape out
              of the ropes when he ties me up.
              And they can defend me.  And
              outsmart him.  And take the pain so
              I don't kill myself just to make it
              stop."  The only problem was, the
              personalities didn't conveniently go
              away when he grew up and no longer
              needed them.  They stayed.  And in
              order to fight fire with fire, some
              of those personalities had learned
              to be as angry and destructive as
              their tormentor.  And finally one of
              those personalities was a part of
              him who needed and demanded love.
              And her name was Adalana.  And three
              times, last October, in the woods
              outside Columbus, she took it.  By
              force.  The devil had finally come
              with the bill.  You've heard Dr.
              Caul and Dr. Harding both testify
              that Multiple Personality Disorder
              not only does exist, but that it's
              symptoms cannot be faked.
              Amnesiatic fugue states cannot be
              faked.  Nystagmus cannot be faked.
              And you've also heard them say that
              he's no longer a threat to himself
              or anybody else, but that if he's
              sent to Lima, where he will be given
              drugs instead of therapy, Billy will
              almost certainly re-fragment, and
              destroy all the remarkable progress
              he's made since coming to Athens.
              And although the prosecution has
              made a lot of the fact that Billy's
              doctors see it as essential to his
              recovery that he be allowed
              furloughs off of hospital grounds
              and into the city, there is a
              fundamental issue not being
              addressed here -- and that is the
              fact that Billy Milligan is not a
              criminal.  The court decided that
              when he was found not guilty.  And
              they were right to do so, We all
              like to think of ourselves as
              compassionate and caring human
              beings and yet as soon as that
              compassion threatens to demand
              something real from us -- a
              demonstration -- proof of its
              existence -- we draw the line.
              Please, your honor, let's use this
              opportunity to take one small step
              in narrowing the gap between our
              potential for compassion and the
              reality of its limits.  If I have an
              incurable disease, and I don't know
              it, and I give it to you, and you
              die -- can I to be tried as a
              murderer?  No.  I didn't know I was
              sick.  So you decide to quarantine
              me instead, which is only sensible,
              since we don't want me to hurt
              anyone else.  But, if I'm then cured
              to the point where I'm no longer
              contagious... do you never let me
              out again?  Billy Milligan has been
              fighting for his life since he was
              eight years old, your honor.  Now
              that he's finally got a piece of it
              back -- please don't take it away
              from him.

    GARY sits.


    INT.  WAITING ROOM - DAY

    BILLY, GARY and JUDY sit waiting.  They say nothing.
    BILLY'S eyes move from one to the other, but they don't
    return the looks.  Then, a BAILIFF enters.

                             BAILIFF
              The Judge is ready.


    INT.  COURTROOM

    As the JUDGE renders his decision.

                             JUDGE
              The court finds that the respondent,
              due to his mental illness, is
              dangerous to himself and to others
              and requires hospitalization in a
              maximum security facility.  It is
              ordered, therefore, that the
              respondent, William Stanley
              Milligan, be committed to the Lima
              State Hospital in Lima, Ohio.

    He raps his gravel.  BILLY sinks into his chair, into
    himself.  GARY knocks his stack of papers to the floor.
    Outside the courtroom, there is an eruption of cheers as
    MOLINARO gives the thumbs up at the window.  GARY finally
    approaches BILLY.  They hug.

                             GARY
                      (in Billy's ear)
              I'm gonna get you out.  I swear to
              God.


    EXT.  COURTHOUSE

    BILLY being led away in handcuffs through the crowd.
    Flashbulbs pop.


    EXT.  COURTHOUSE STEPS

    GARY and JUDY watching as BANKS and MOLINARO are
    interviewed.

                             INTERVIEWER
              Do you have any comment, Mr.
              Molinaro?

                             MOLINARO
              Yeah, I have a comment.  What took
              them so long?


    INT.  POLICE CAR

    TWO COPS shove BILLY roughly into the back seat.

                             COP
              We got you now, motherfucker.

    The car pulls away.


    EXT.  ROAD - DAY

    The police car driving through a light drizzle.  We hear
    BILLY'S V.O.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              Dear Gary, Billy is asleep.
              Something very bad is happening but
              I don't know what.  The doctors say
              bad things about us and what hurts
              most is they are right.


    EXT.  LIMA - DAY

    The car pulls up and delivers BILLY.  It is every bit as
    horrific as one might expect.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              We, I, am a freak, a misfit, a
              biological error.  We all hate this
              place, but it's where we belong.

                             COP
                      (as he gets Billy out
                       of the car)
              Welcome to Hell.


    INT.  LIMA

    MEN in the deepest throes of mental illness wander the
    corridors, some naked, as BILLY is taken to his room.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              Ragen is stopping everything for
              good.  He has to.  He says if you do
              not speak, you do no damage to
              anyone on the outside or the inside.
              No one can blame us for anything.

    A LINE

    of zombied out MEN, including BILLY, getting their
    Thorazine.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              The span of attention will be turned
              inward and it will enforce the total
              block.  By shutting out the real
              world, we can live peacefully in
              ours.  We know that a world without
              pain is a world without feeling...
              but a world without feeling is a
              world without pain.

    The MAN in front of BILLY has now reached the head of the
    line.  He becomes upset.  He refuses the medication,
    screams "No!" and runs off.  BILLY steps up and takes his
    medicine.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    BILLY walking aimlessly.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              When I'm not asleep and not on the
              spot, it's like I'm lying face down
              on a street of glass that stretches
              out forever and I can look down
              through it.  Beyond that, in the
              farthest ground, it seems like stars
              of outer space, but then there's a
              circle.  A beam of light.

    BILLY

    receiving electro-shock therapy.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              It's almost as if it's coming out of
              my eyes because it's always in front
              of me.  Around it, some of my people
              are lying in coffins.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    A continuation of the earlier shot: BILLY walks aimlessly.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              The lids aren't on them because
              they're not dead yet.


    INT.  ROOM AT LIMA

    A DOCTOR, in a suit and white lab coat, is hitting BILLY
    with a Bible as he's held down by ATTENDANTS.

                             DOCTOR
              I rebuke you demons, in the name of
              the savior, Jesus Christ!  Leave
              this wretched soul!

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              They're asleep, waiting for
              something.  There are some empty
              coffins because not everyone has
              come there yet.


    INT.  CORRIDOR

    BILLY continues walking.  He reaches a MEN'S ROOM and
    looks in.  The toilets are stainless steel.  He shifts his
    gaze.  The MAN who refuses his Thorazine is running the
    sink water at a boiling hot temperature.  He looks at
    BILLY through the steam.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              Danny and the other young ones want
              a chance at life.  The older ones
              have given up hope.

    The MAN puts his finger under the water -- never taking
    his eyes off BILLY.  The flesh quickly bubbles and boils
    off.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              Danny named this place because he
              made it.

    The MAN brings what's left of his digit to his mouth and
    bites it off.

                             BILLY (V.O.)
              He calls it "The Dying Place".


    INT.  BILLY'S ROOM

    A GUARD throws in some paints, a brush and a piece of
    paper, then leaves.  BILLY picks up the paintbrush, but
    sets the paper aside.  He turns to the white wall and
    starts a mural.  It begins to segue into the Rotoscope
    animation -- then flowing once more into reality as it
    charts the accelerated progress of the painting.  Back and
    forth, until it's become a lush, green landscape.
    Idyllic, lyrical.

    WE PRESS IN on BILLY, in both reality and animation, as he
    paints, until we can no longer see the room around him --
    just BILLY, enveloped in this peaceful, green Eden --
    painting himself out of Hell and into a world of escape.


    LEGEND ON SCREEN:

    Gary Schweickart appealed Billy Milligan's case to the
    Supreme Court.  On December 4, 1980, he was returned to
    Athens State Hospital, where he was successfully fused.
    Lima State Hospital was closed soon afterwards, amid
    indictments for patient abuse.


    A SECOND LEGEND REPLACES THE FIRST:

    Today, after thirteen years in the Ohio Mental Health
    System.  Billy Milligan is a free man and supporting
    himself as an artist.
