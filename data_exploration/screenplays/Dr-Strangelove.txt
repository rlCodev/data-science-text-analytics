           For more than a year, ominous rumors have been privately circulating among high
              level western leaders, that the Soviet Union had been at work on what was
              darkly hinted to be the ultimate weapon, a doomsday device. Intelligence
            sources traced the site of the top secret Russian project to the perpetually
            fog shrouded wasteland below the arctic peaks of the Zokov islands. What they
             were building, or why it should be located in a such a remote and desolate
                                      place, no one could say.

           Very well, now, listen to me carefully. The base is being put on condition red.
                          I want this flashed to all sections immediately. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
               Condition red, sir. Yes. Jolly good idea, keeps the men on their toes.

            I shouldn't tell you this, Mandrake, but you're a good officer and you have a
                       right to know. It looks like we're in a shooting war.

              Mandrake, that's all I've been told. It just came in on the Red Phone. My
              orders are for this base to be sealed tight, and that's what I mean    to
             do: seal it tight. Now, I want you to transmit plan R, R for Robert, to the
                                      wing. Plan R for Robert.

             In order to guard against surprise nuclear attack, America's Strategic Air
           Command        maintains a large force of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day.
          Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear        bombload of 50 megatons, equal to 16 times
        the total explosive force of all the bombs and         shells used by all the armies
            in World War Two. Based in America, the Airborne alert force is deployed from
           the Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean, but they have one geographical factor in
                  common: they are all two hours from their targets inside Russia.

           plan R unless them Russkies had already clobbered Washington and alot of other

              Your commie has no regard for human life, not even his own. And for this
            reason, men, I want to impress upon you the need for extreme   watchfulness.
           The enemy may come individually,       or he may come in strength. He may even
           come in        the uniform of our own troops. But however he comes we must stop
            him. We must not allow him to gain entrance to this base. Now, I am going to 
             give you three simple rules. First, trust no   one, whatever his uniform or
        rank, unless he is     known to you personally. Second, anyone or      anything that
           approaches within 200 yards of the perimeter is to be fired upon. Third, if in
            doubt, shoot first, and ask questions afterwards. I would sooner accept a few
            casualties through accident than lose the      entire base and its personnel
             through carelessness. Any variation on these rules must        come from me
           personally. Now, men, in conclusion, I would like to say that, in the two years
           it has been my privilege to be your commanding officer, I have always expected
          the best from you, and you have never given me         anything less than that.

           Excuse me sir, something rather interesting's just cropped up. Listen to that.
           Music. Civilian broadcasting. I think those fellows in the Pentagon have given
              us some sort of exercise to test our readiness. Personally, I think it's
             taking it a bit too far; our fellows will be inside Russian radar cover in
              about twenty minutes. You listen to that. Traffic block full of stations

              was in progress we would certainly not be hearing civilian broadcasting.

             attack was not in progress then your use of plan R, in fact your orders to
               the entire wing... oh. Well I would say, sir, that there was something

               recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action open: total
               committment. Mandrake, do you recall what Clemenzo once said about war?

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                  No. I don't think I do sir, no. 

                                                RIPPER 
             He said war was to important to be left to the Generals. When he said that,
            fifty years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to
              be left to politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the
           inclination for strategic thought. I can no longer sit back and allow Communist
                infiltration, Communist indoctrination, communist subversion, and the
             international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious
                                           bodily fluids.

   INT. WAR ROOM - PENTAGON 

   

                                              MUFFLEY 
                                      Sam, is everybody here? 

                                                STAINS 
                Mr. President, the Secretary of State is in Vietnam, the Secretary of
                Defense is in Laos, and the Vice President is in Mexico City. We can 
                   establish contact with them at any time if it's necessary. The
                             undersecretaries are all here, of course. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                        Right. Now, General Turgidson, what's going on here? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
               Mr. President, about thirty-five minutes ago, General Jack Ripper, the
              commanding General of Burpleson Air Force Base, issued an order to the 34
               B-52's of his wing which were airborne at the time as part of a special
              exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick. Now, it appears that
             the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia. The
           planes are fully armed with nuclear weapons with an average load of 40 megatons
              each. Now the central display of Russia will indicate the position of the
               planes. The triangles are their primary targets, the squares are their
             secondary targets. The aircraft will begin penetrating Russian radar cover
                                         within 25 minutes. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand. I was under the
             impression that I was the only one in authority to order the use of nuclear
                                              weapons. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            That's right sir. You are the only person authorized to do so. And although I
               hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to look like
                               General Ripper exceeded his authority. 

                                                MUFFLEY
              It certainly does. Far beyond the point I would have imagined possible. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                   Well perhaps you're forgetting the provisions of plan R, sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                              Plan R? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            Plan R is an emergency war plan in which a lower echelon commander may order
             nuclear retaliation after a sneak attack if the normal chain of command is
             disrupted. You approved it, sir. You must remember. Surely you must recall,
              sir, when Senator Buford made that big hassle about our deterrent lacking
            credibility. The idea was for plan R to be a sort of retaliatory safeguard. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                            A safeguard. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             I admit the human element seems to have failed us here. But the idea was to
           discourage the Russkies from any hope that they could knock out Washington, and
              yourself, sir, as part of a general sneak attack, and escape retaliation
                           because of lack of proper command and control. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            Well I assume then, that the planes will return automatically once they reach
                                       their failsafe points. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            Well, sir, I'm afraid not. You see the planes were holding at their failsafe
             points when the go code was issued. Now, once they fly beyond failsafe they
           do not require a second order to proceed. They will fly until they reach their
                                              targets. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                Then why haven't you radioed the planes countermanding the go code? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
               Well, I'm afraid we're unable to communicate with any of the aircraft. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                                Why? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
           As you may recall, sir, one of the provisions of plan R provides that once the
            go code is received the normal SSB radios in the aircraft are switched into a
           special coded device, which I believe is designated as CRM114. Now, in order to
             prevent the enemy from issuing fake or confusing orders, CRM114 is designed
             not to receive at all, unless the message is preceded by the correct three
                                     letter code group prefix. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
             Then do you mean to tell me, General Turgidson, that you will be unable to
                                        recall the aircraft? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             That's about the size of it. However, we are plowing through every possible
                 three letter combination of the code. But since there are seventeen
              thousand permutations it's going to take us about two and a half days to
                                         transmit them all. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                How soon did you say the planes would penetrate Russian radar cover? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                               About eighteen minutes from now, sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                              Are you in contact with General Ripper? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                 Ah.. No sir, no, General Ripper sealed off the base and cut off all
                                          communications. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                              Where did you get all this information? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
              General Ripper called Strategic Air Command headquarters shortly after he
            issued the go code. I have a partial transcript of that conversation if you'd
                                        like me to read it. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                              Read it. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
           The duty officer asked General Ripper to confirm the fact the he had issued the
            go code and he said, "Yes gentlemen, they are on their way in and no one can
             bring them back. For the sake of our country and our way of life, I suggest
                 you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise we will be totally
             destroyed by red retaliation. My boys will give you the best kind of start,
            fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell won't stop them now. So
              let's get going. There's no other choice. God willing, we will prevail in
            peace and freedom from fear and in true health through the purity and essence
           of our natural fluids. God bless you all." Then he hung up. We're still trying
                        to figure out the meaning of that last phrase, sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
              There's nothing to figure out General Turgidson. This man is obviously a
                                             psychotic. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            Well, I'd like to hold off judgment on a thing like that, sir, until all the
                                           facts are in. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                           (anger rising) 
               General Turgidson, when you instituted the human reliability tests, you
                assured me there was no possibility of such a thing ever occurring. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             Well I don't think it's quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a
                                        single slip up sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                  I want to speak to General Ripper on the telephone, personally. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                                 I'm afraid that's impossible, sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
           General Turgidson, I am becoming less and less interested in your estimates of
                         what is possible and impossible. General Faceman. 

                                               FACEMAN 
                                             Yes, sir. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                    Are there any army units stationed anywhere near Burpleson? 

                                                FACEMAN
                                   Well ah, I'll just check, sir. 

                                                   
Turgidson's phone beeps 

   

                                             TURGIDSON 
                                               Hello. 
                                      (pause, then whispering) 
              I told you never to call me here; don't you know where I am? (pause) Well
                look, baby, I can't talk to you now. My president needs me. Of course
                               Bucky would rather be there with you. 
                                              (pause) 
              Of course it isn't only physical. I deeply respect you as a human being.
                         Someday I'm going to make you Mrs. Buck Turgidson. 
                                              (pause) 
            Listen, you go back to sleep. Bucky'll be back there just as soon as he can.
                      Alright. Listen, sug', don't forget to say your prayers. 
                                  (hangs up and composes himself) 

                                               FACEMAN 
               Apparently, the 23rd airborne division is stationed seven miles away at
                                             Alvarado. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
             General Faceman, I want them to enter the base, locate General Ripper, and
                          put him in immediate telephone contact with me. 

                                               FACEMAN 
                                             Yes, sir. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                 Mr. President, if I may advise, under condition red it is standard
              procedure that the base be sealed off, and the base be defended by base 
             security troops. Any force trying to enter there would certainly encounter
                                       very heavy casualties. 

                                               FACEMAN 
             General Turgidson, with all due respect for your defense team, my boys can
                             brush 'em aside without too much trouble. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
               Mr. President, there are one or two points I'd like to make, if I may. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                         Go ahead, General. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             One, our hopes for recalling the 843rd bomb wing are quickly being reduced
             to a very low order of probability. Two, in less than fifteen minutes from
             now the Russkies will be making radar contact with the planes. Three, when
               they do, they are going to go absolutely ape, and they're gonna strike
               back with everything they've got. Four, if prior to this time, we have
              done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities, we will
              suffer virtual annihilation. Now, five, if on the other hand, we were to
             immediately launch an all out and coordinated attack on all their airfields
             and missile bases we'd stand a damn good chance of catching 'em with their
               pants down. Hell, we got a five to one missile superiority as it is. We
              could easily assign three missiles to every target, and still have a very
             effective reserve force for any other contingency. Now, six, an unofficial
           study which we undertook of this eventuality, indicated that we would destroy 
              ninety percent of their nuclear capabilities. We would therefore prevail,
                and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties from their 
                  remaining force which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
             General, it is the avowed policy of our country never to strike first with
                                          nuclear weapons. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            Well, Mr. President, I would say that General Ripper has already invalidated
                                       that policy. (laughs)

            That was not an act of national policy and there are still alternatives left
                                            open to us. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching a moment of truth both for
              ourselves as human beings and for the life of our nation. Now, the truth
              is not always a pleasant thing, but it is necessary now make a choice, to
            choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless, distinguishable
             post-war environments: one where you got twenty million people killed, and
                 the other where you got a hundred and fifty million people killed. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                        You're talking about mass murder, General, not war. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
               Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do
              say... no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh... depended on
                                            the breaks. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
              I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolph
                                              Hitler! 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with
                  the American people, than with your image in the history books. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
             General Turgidson, I think I've heard quite sufficient from you, thank you
                                             very much!

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                     Oh, good. Any difficulty?

                                               MUFFLEY 
                Yes, that can't be helped. Have him brought down here straight away. 

                                                STAINS 
                                             Yes, sir. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                        Is that the Russian Ambassador you're talking about? 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                        Yes, it is, General. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
            Ahh, am I to understand the Russian Ambassador is to be admitted entrance to
                                           the War Room? 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                             That is correct. He is here on my orders. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             I... I don't know exactly how to put this, sir, but are you aware of what a
                        serious breach of security that would be? I mean... 
                                   (begins closing his notebooks) 
                           he'll see everything. He'll see the big board! 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            That is precisely the idea, General. That is precisely the idea. Stains, get
                                   Premier Kissov on the Hotline.

             Well, listen, how do you think I feel about it? Can you imagine how I feel
              about it, Dimitri? Why do you think I'm calling you? Just to say hello? 
                                              (listens)
            Of course I like to speak to you. Of course I like to say hello. Not now, but
              any time, Dimitri. I'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has
                                             happened.

              friendly, ... you probably wouldn't have even got it. They will not reach
                              their targets for at least another hour.

             Well I'll tell you. We'd like to give your air staff a complete run down on
              the targets, the flight plans, and the defensive systems of the planes.

              Yes! I mean, if we're unable to recall the planes, then I'd say that, uh,
                  well, we're just going to have to help you destroy them, Dimitri.

               What? I see, just ask for Omsk Information. I'm sorry too, Dimitri. I'm

             Alright! You're sorrier than I am! But I am sorry as well. I am as sorry as
              you are, Dimitri. Don't say that you are more sorry than I am, because I
            am capable of being just as sorry as you are. So we're both sorry, alright? 
            (listens) Alright. Yes he's right here. Yes, he wants to talk to you. Just a

             When it is detonated, it will produce enough lethal radioactive fallout so
               that within ten months, the surface of the earth will be as dead as the

              Ah, come on DeSadeski, that's ridiculous. Our studies show that even the
                       worst fallout is down to a safe level after two weeks.

              Cobalt thorium G has a radioactive halflife of ninety three years. If you
             take, say, fifty H-bombs in the hundred megaton range and jacket them with
                cobalt thorium G, when they are exploded they will produce a doomsday
              shroud. A lethal cloud of radioactivity which will encircle the earth for
                                        ninety three years!

               No sir. It is not a thing a sane man would do. The doomsday machine is
                            designed to to trigger itself automatically. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                               But surely you can disarm it somehow. 

                                              DESADESKI  
             No. It is designed to explode if any attempt is ever made to untrigger it. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                                           Automatically? 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                         Ahh.. it's an obvious commie trick, Mr. President. 
                (walks backwards towards the big board) We're wasting valuable time. 
                   (falls over backwards and does a somersault, and brings himself
                                        back onto his feet) 
                    Look at the big board! They're getting ready to clobber us! 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            But this is absolute madness, ambassador. Why should you build such a thing? 

                                              DESADESKI  
              There are those of us who fought against it, but in the end we could not
             keep up with the expense involved in the arms race, the space race, and the
              peace race. And at the same time our people grumbled for more nylons and
               washing machines. Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction of
            what we'd been spending on defense in a single year. But the deciding factor
               was when we learned that your country was working along similar lines,
                               and we were afraid of a doomsday gap. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                  This is preposterous. I've never approved of anything like that. 

                                              DESADESKI  
                                 Our source was the New York Times. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                    Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything like that in the works? 

                                                   
Stains and Turgidson, who have been listening to Muffley and DeSadeski Stains'
 station at the round table, slowly turn their heads in search of Strangelove. 

   

                                            STRANGELOVE 
                                          (in wheelchair) 
                                  A moment please, Mr. President. 

                                                   
Stomps one foot on the tile floor, pushes back from the table and begins
 wheeling towards the discussion between Muffley and DeSadeski.

   

                                            STRANGELOVE  
                 Under the authority granted me as director of weapons research and
             development, I commissioned last year a study of this project by the Bland
            corporation. Based on the findings of the report, my conclusion was that this
               idea was not a practical deterrent, for reasons which, at this moment,
                                      must be all too obvious. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                 Then you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing? 

            Strangelove carefully plucks cigarette from his shaking right hand, which is in
                                           a black glove. 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
              Mr. President, the technology required is easily within the means of even
                  the smallest nuclear power. It requires only the will to do so. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            But, how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically, and at
                               the same time impossible to untrigger? 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
             Mr. President, it is not only possible, it is essential. That is the whole
                idea of this machine, you know. Deterrence is the art of producing in
            the mind of the enemy... the fear to attack. And so, because of the automated
             and irrevocable decision making process which rules out human meddling, the
              doomsday machine is terrifying. It's simple to understand. And completely
                                     credible, and convincing. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                     Gee, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines, Stainsy. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
             But this is fantastic, Strangelove. How can it be triggered automatically? 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
            Well, it's remarkably simple to do that. When you merely wish to bury bombs,
                 there is no limit to the size. After that they are connected to a 
           gigantic complex of computers. Now then, a specific and clearly defined set of 
            circumstances, under which the bombs are to be exploded, is programmed into a
                                         tape memory bank. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
             Strangelove. What kind of a name is that? That ain't no kraut name, is it,
                                              Stainsy? 

                                                STAINS 
              He changed it when he became a citizen. It used to be Merkwurkdigliebe. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                           Hmm. A kraut, by any other name, huh, Stainsy? 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
              Yes, but the... whole point of the doomsday machine... is lost... if you
                        keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh? 

                                              DESADESKI  
              It was to be announced at the Party Congress on Monday. As you know, the
                                      Premier loves surprises.

   Bullets cut down picture frames behind the desk. Ripper, standing, shoots back
 at unseen machinegunner. Mandrake is now crouching by his side.

                Stay with me Mandrake. Ripper and Mandrake crawl to one side of desk.
                              Alright, Mandrake, now feed me. Feed me. 

                                                   
Ripper stands and exchanges fire with attacking troops. Enemy fire subsides.

                                              (laughs) 
              Jack, don't you think we'd be better off in some other part of the room,
                                  away from all this flying glass? 

                                                RIPPER 
                Ah, naah. We're ok here. Mandrake, do you realize that in addition to
               fluoridated water, why, there are studies underway to fluoridate salt,
               flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Mandrake.
                                       Children's ice cream? 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                             Good Lord. 

                                                RIPPER 
                              You know when fluoridation first began? 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                     No. No, I don't, Jack. No. 

                                                RIPPER 
             Nineteen hundred and forty six. Nineteen fortysix, Mandrake. How does that
             coincide with your postwar commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious,
                isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily 
              fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any
                        choice. That's the way your hard core commie works. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
            Jack... Jack, listen, tell me, ah... when did you first become, well, develop
                                            this theory. 

                                                RIPPER 
             Well, I ah, I I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act
                                              of love. 

                                                   
Mandrake sighs fearfully 

   

                                               RIPPER 
             Yes a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I
                  was able to interpret these feelings correctly: loss of essence. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                               Yes... 

                                                RIPPER 
               I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women... women sense my
             power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake, but
                                     I do deny them my essence. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                          Heh heh... yes.

               No no, Jack. Not a bit of it. No, I'm sure they all gave you their very
             best. And I'm equally sure they all died thinking of you, every man jack of
              them, heh, Jack. Supposing a bit of water has gone off, eh? And certainly
             one can never be too sure about those sort of things. Would you look at me
             now. Do I look all rancid and clotted? You look at me, Jack, eh? Look, eh?
             And I drink a lot of water, you know. I'm what you might call a water man,
             Jack. That's what I am. And I can swear to you, my boy, swear to you, that
                 there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids. Not a thing, Jackie.

                 Oh... well... I don't know, Jack. Difficult to think of under these
               conditions. But, well, what happened was they got me on the old Rangoon
                 HNRR railway. I was laying train mines for the bloody Japanese puff
                                               puffs.

              Ah, oh no, I ah... I don't think they wanted me to talk, really. I don't
              think they wanted me to say anything. It was just their way of having... 
                a bit of fun, the swines. Strange thing is they make such bloody good
                                              cameras.

                                               MANDRAKE 
            Yes. does a double take Yes, well you may have... you may have quite a point
                                            there, Jack.

                       I don't know how well I could stand up under torture. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
            Well of course the answer to that is, boy, no one ever does. And my advice to
              you, Jack, is to give me the code now. And if those devils come back and
            try any rough stuff, we'll fight them together, boy, like we did just now, on
               the floor, eh? You with the old gun, and me with the belt and the ammo,
                 feeding you, Jack! Feed me, you said, and I was feeding you, Jack.

             No, Mandrake. I happen to believe in a life after this one, and I know I'll
                       have to answer for what I've done. And I think I can. 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                Yes, well of course you can, Jack, of course you can. You can! I'm a
            religious man, myself, you know, Jack. I believe in all that sort of thing, 
                                 and... I'm hoping, you know, Jack.

 the 50 cal. which he lets fall.

                                 You dropped your gun, Jack, yes... 
             (picks up the machine gun and carries it) you know what I'm  (Ripper begins
              removing his jacket here) no, Jack. Let me take that for you. I'll take 
              that for you, Jack.  (takes Ripper's jacket and drapes it over the gun) 
             And, ah, you know what I'm hoping, Jack? I'm hoping you're going to give me
                         the code, boy. That's what I'm hoping. And, ah... 
                                    (Ripper enters the washroom) 
            oh, you're going have a little wash and brush up, are you? What a good idea.
             Always did wonders for a man, that, Jack. A little wash and brush up. Water
              on the back of the neck, and... makes you feel marvelous. That's what we
                need, Jack! Water on the back of the neck and the code. Now, ... now
                    supposing I play a little guessing game with you, Jack, boy. 
                                    (Ripper shuts washroom door) 
                    I'll try and guess... I'll try and guess what the code is...

                                                   
A gun shot rings out from within the washroom - Mandrake gapes at the closed
 door, drops the machine gun, and pushes on the door, which is blocked after
 opening a few inches.

           place an emergency person to person call with President Merkin Muffley in the 
                Pentagon, Washington D.C. Aaaa... Burpleson3-9180. No, I'm perfectly
            serious, operator, the President, yes the President of the United States. I'm
             sorry, I haven't got enough change. Um, could you... could you make this a
                                      collect call, operator? 

                                                   
Mandrake waits on the call to be placed while Guano looks on.

                                     Just one second, operator. 
                                             (to Guano) 
                     They won't accept the call. Have you got fifty-five cents? 

                                                GUANO 
             Well, you don't think I'd go into combat with loose change in my pocket, do
                                                you? 

                                               MANDRAKE 
              Operator, look, ah... is it possible to make this an ordinary... ordinary
                      trunk call? Well, what do you call it... you know, ah... 
                                 (raps on phone box with knuckles)

                                    (counts change in his palm) 
            Oh, blast. Still twenty cents short. Operator, hold on one... ah... I shan't
             keep you a second. (to Guano)  Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine, I want you
                    to shoot the lock off it. There may be some change in there. 

                                                GUANO 
                                      That's private property.

               Colonel, can you possibly imagine what is going to happen to you, your
              frame, outlook, way of life and everything, when they learn that you have
             obstructed a telephone call to the President of the United States? Can you
               imagine? Shoot it off! Shoot! With the gun! That's what the bullets are
                                           for, you twit! 

                                                GUANO 
             Ok. I'm gonna get your money for you. But if you don't get the President of
              the Unites States on that phone, you know what's going to happen to you? 

                                               MANDRAKE 
                                               What? 

                                                GUANO 
                      You're going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company. 

                                                   
Turns to the Coke machine and fires into it. Change spills from the coin return
 slot. As Guano bends to collect it, coke streams from a bullet hole and showers
 his face.

                                        targeted for Lapuda!

              trained to do it. You know, it's it's initiative! Look, Dimitri, you know
                exactly where they're going and I'm sure your entire air defense can
            stop a single plane. Listen, I mean, it's not going to help either one of us

             it's secondary target it Bordkov, I mean it's it's true, Dimitri! You gotta

            Mr. President, I would not rule out the chance to preserve a nucleus of human
                          specimens. It would be quite easy... heh heh... 
                                   (rolls forward into the light) 
           at the bottom of ah ... some of our deeper mineshafts. The radioactivity would
               never penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep. And in a matter of
             weeks, sufficient improvements in dwelling space could easily be provided. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
                            How long would you have to stay down there?

              aa...nn... Radioactive halflife of uh,... hmm.. I would think that uh...
                                 possibly uh... one hundred years. 

                                                   
On finishing his calculations, he pulls the slide rule roughly from his gloved
 hand, and returns it to within his jacket. 

   

                                              MUFFLEY 
                You mean, people could actually stay down there for a hundred years?

              It would not be difficult mein Fuhrer! Nuclear reactors could, heh... I'm
                 sorry. Mr. President. Nuclear reactors could provide power almost 
              indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plantlife. Animals could be bred
             and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the available
               mine sites in the country. But I would guess... that ah, dwelling space
               for several hundred thousands of our people could easily be provided. 

                                               MUFFLEY 
            Well I... I would hate to have to decide.. who stays up and.. who goes down. 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
                 Well, that would not be necessary Mr. President. It could easily be
            accomplished with a computer. And a computer could be set and programmed to 
           accept factors from youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross
            section of necessary skills. Of course it would be absolutely vital that our
            top government and military men be included to foster and impart the required
                              principles of leadership and tradition.

             Naturally, they would breed prodigiously, eh? There would bemuch time, and
               little to do. But ah with the proper breeding techniques and a ratio of
            say, ten females to each male, I would guess that they could then work their
              way back to the present gross national product within say, twenty years.

                                             Excuse me.

                                                   
He struggles with wayward right arm, ultimately subduing it with a beating from
 his left

             Also when... when they go down into the mine everyone would still be alive.
             There would be no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion will be one
                 of nostalgia for those left behind, combined with a spirit of bold
                             curiosity for the adventure ahead! Ahhhh! 

                                                   
Right arm reflexes into Nazi salute. He pulls it back into his lap and beats it
 again. Gloved hand attempts to strangle him.

            Doctor, you mentioned the ration of ten women to each man. Now, wouldn't that
           necessitate the abandonment of the so called monogamous sexual relationship, I
                                mean, as far as men were concerned? 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
             Regrettably, yes. But it is, you know, a sacrifice required for the future
             of the human race. I hasten to add that since each man will be required to
           do prodigious... service along these lines, the women will have to be selected
                 for their sexual characteristics which will have to be of a highly
                                        stimulating nature. 

                                              DESADESKI  
                 I must confess, you have an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor. 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
                                          Thank you, sir. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
                                            (to Muffley) 
               I think we should look at this from the military point of view. I mean,
            supposing the Russkies stashes away some big bomb, see. When they come out in
                               a hundred years they could take over! 

                                                   
DeSadeski begins walking away from the crowd around Strangelove and the
 President, toward the banquet table. 

   

                                              GENERAL 
               I agree, Mr. President. In fact, they might even try an immediate sneak
                        attack so they could take over our mineshaft space. 

                                              TURGIDSON 
           Yeah. I think it would be extremely naive of us, Mr. President, to imagine that
             these new developments are going to cause any change in Soviet expansionist
                                              policy. 

                                                   
DeSadeski kneels, unseen, and begins photographing the big board with a secret
 camera within a pocket watch. 

   

                                             TURGIDSON 
             I mean, we must be... increasingly on the alert to prevent them from taking
             over other mineshaft space, in order to breed more prodigiously than we do,
             thus, knocking us out in superior numbers when we emerge! Mr. President, we
                                must not allow... a mine shaft gap! 

                                             STRANGELOVE 
                                              ...sir! 
                                 (stands up out of his wheelchair) 
                                        I have a plan. Heh. 
                              (pauses, realizing that he is standing) 
                                      Mein Fuhrer, I can walk! 

                                                   

MULTIPLE SCENES OF EXPLODING BOMBS, dancing to the tune of "We'll Meet Again." 

   FADE OUT:
 

    

 

                                              THE END
