               FADE IN:

               EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  DAY

               Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading: "THIS IS 
               WHERE IT IS  PARALLEL 38." Below these words, arrows point 
               to "NORTH KOREA" in one direction, "SOUTH KOREA" in opposite 
               one. Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the 
               north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to 
               the hospital Admitting Ward.

               Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze goes 
               from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can 
               read at first are the very large letters: "M-A-S-H." Moving 
               closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can 
               make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large letters 
               it says: "4077TH," and then we see there is the remainder of 
               a word following each of the large letters, but in much 
               smaller print, so that "M-A-S-H" becomes "Mobile Army Surgical 
               Hospital." The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S. 
               Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each into 
               the Admitting Ward.

               LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the 
               Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches 
               grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into 
               his hospital. CORPORAL "RADAR" O'REILLY, with a long thin 
               neck, large ears and a knack for anticipating his Colonel's 
               wishes, moves up close behind him.

                                     HENRY
                              (loudly)
                         O'Reilly!

                                     RADAR
                              (at his side)
                         Yes, sir?

                                     HENRY
                         Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! 
                         Tell Major Burns...

                                     RADAR
                         One of the surgeons from the day 
                         shift will have to stay on duty 
                         tonight?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, dammit, and...

               He interrupts himself, frightened by the intense expression 
               on Radar's face. The Corporal's head is turning back and 
               forth like an actual radar receiver, monitoring the northern 
               horizon where the valley of a river meanders between 
               mountainous ridges.

                                     HENRY
                         O'Reilly, what is it?
                              (appalled at the 
                              thought)
                         There aren't more choppers coming?

                                     RADAR
                         I'm afraid so, Colonel.

                                     HENRY
                         We've got too many wounded for us to 
                         handle now! Get on the phone right 
                         away and...

                                     RADAR
                         Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach 
                         General Hammond in Seoul for you. 
                         You think he'll finally break down 
                         and give us two more surgeons?

               The DISTANT SOUND of more HELICOPTERS becomes faintly audible 
               to the normal human ear, and a moment later one appears over 
               a ridge.

               TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. MOTOR POOL AND RAILROAD DEPOT  325TH EVACUATION 
               HOSPITAL  YONG-DONG-PA  DAY

               Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep, 
               each carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag. Though 
               they still wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as 
               captain's bars on their caps and overcoats, they are far 
               from West Point standards in dress and manner. DUKE, 29, is 
               still solidly built like the fullback he once was. HAWKEYE, 
               28, a former end, is taller and rangier, wears glasses. Their 
               accents, Georgia and Maine respectively, are in sharp 
               contrast. A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT who has driven the Jeep up 
               climbs out.

                                     MOTOR POOL DRIVER
                         You the guys going to the 4077th?

                                     DUKE
                         I'm one of 'em.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (state of Maine 
                              affirmative)
                         Ayuh. I'm the other then.

               As they stow their gear in the back of the Jeep.

                                     MOTOR POOL SARGEANT
                         Lots of luck.

               He leaves.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         My name's Hawkeye Pierce.

                                     DUKE
                         Duke Forrest.

               Hawkeye takes the driver's seat. Duke, getting into the right-
               hand side, has no objection, just a question.

                                     DUKE
                         You got directions?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink 
                         to wake me up.

                                     DUKE
                         I got some.

               He turns around and opens his barracks bag, where he finds a 
               pint bottle conveniently located near the top.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Make it yourself, or is it real?

                                     DUKE
                         Georgia, where I come from, it's 
                         real if you make it yourself. But I 
                         been buying from the Yankee Government 
                         since they put me in this soldier 
                         suit and give me a rate.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Tax-free booze. It's about all you 
                         can say for army life.

                                     DUKE
                              (passing bottle)
                         Where you from with that crazy way 
                         of talking?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Crabapple Cove. Maine.

                                     DUKE
                         Damn! That must be about as far north 
                         as you can get.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Pretty near. What do you know about 
                         the outfit we're going to?

                                     DUKE
                         C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant 
                         Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of 
                         them regular army clowns. Push you 
                         around so it's hard to get any decent 
                         work done.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We got to head them off, right at 
                         the start. Push them around first.

               They have exchanged the bottle a couple of times. In the act 
               of raising it to his mouth, Hawkeye looks toward the hospital 
               doorway.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I think we already caught their eye.

               Two MPs have emerged from the hospital administration offices 
               and are heading toward them. Hawkeye goes into action quickly, 
               starting the Jeep engine.

                                     DUKE
                         What's the initials 'MP' stand for, 
                         Hawkeye?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!

               The Jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and 
               accelerates dangerously as it careens out of the hospital 
               grounds.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. ROAD NEAR OUIJONGBU  DAY

               Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road  
               they come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen: 
               "Last chance before Peking". A short distance behind the 
               sign, it is now revealed are three parked U.S. Army trucks, 
               in front of which parades a group of Korean prostitutes from 
               fourteen to forty-five.

               Despite the autumn weather, their costumes, mixed American 
               mail order and Korean, are chosen for seductive appeal rather 
               than warmth.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore 
                         
                              (pronounced 'howah')
                         House. You in the market Duke?

                                     DUKE
                              (in negation)
                         I done my shopping in Seoul last 
                         night.

               They now have a fairly clear view of a GI and a Korean female 
               lying in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks, 
               their activity only partially concealed by a blanket.

                                     DUKE
                         Curb service is right.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. APPROACH TO 4077TH MASH  DAY

               Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road 
               where they can get a downward look at their future home. The 
               river valley in which the 4077th Mash is situated is almost 
               surrounded by mountains. The components of the post are spread 
               out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of level ground 
               in the middle. At the closed end of the horseshoe is the 
               main hospital building, made of wood with a tin roof marked 
               by a large red cross; everything else is canvas. To the left 
               of the main building are strung out the Admitting Ward, 
               Laboratory, Dental Clinic, Mess Hall, PX, Showers Tent, Barber 
               Tent and the Enlisted Men's Tents. On the right side are the 
               Postop Ward, Officers' Tents, Nurses' Tents, Korean Domestics' 
               Tents and finally, the Officers' Club. In the f.g., from 
               Duke and Hawkeye's angle are four helicopters belonging to 
               the 5th Air Rescue Squadron, and the signs we have already 
               seen marking the post and the 38th Parallel.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Well, there it is. Jesus!

                                     DUKE
                         The spot we picked to spend the 
                         winter. Maybe we ought to look a 
                         little harder.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MASH MESS HALL  DAY

               As Hawkeye and Duke enter. The large tent has two floor levels 
               separated by a railing into a section for officers and one 
               for enlisted men, the two groups being much closer to 
               numerical equality here than in an ordinary military 
               installation. There is a further voluntary piece of 
               segregation within the officers' section: the men  medical 
               officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a 
               helicopter pilot  are at one long, rectangular table; the 
               nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutenant to captain, 
               at another.

               Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the 
               officers' section, but Duke calls his attention to the 
               outstanding feature of the nurses' table: LIEUTENANT DISH, 
               24, blonde and clearly, even in her winter fatigues, the 
               sexiest looking nurse in military history.

                                     DUKE
                         What do you think of that piece of 
                         scenery, Yankee boy?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Finest kind. We'll sit where we can 
                         get the best view.

               Accordingly, they select seats close to the nurses and facing 
               the Lieutenant. Some personnel are on duty in the hospital 
               during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the 
               following three nurses with whom we will become acquainted 
               are present here:

               KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly 
               built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE, 
               also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive, 
               cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent male 
               matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as 
               inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and 
               LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match Dish or Leslie by physical 
               standards but has the asset of instant availability.

               A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue pants 
               and an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke and 
               Hawkeye's plates with food. Duke is hungry enough to turn 
               his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to 
               keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating. Thus neither 
               of them is aware of the attention they are getting from the 
               male officers' group, which includes HENRY, a couple of 
               medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED 
               (officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Catholic 
               Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter 
               Zaldowski, Dental Officer), both in their thirties; and 
               CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an Australian anesthesiologist.

               There is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unlisted 
               men's section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER, 
               Henry's overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young, 
               black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who looks 
               too young and nervous to be in any man's army; and PFC 
               SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him 
               halfway around the world.

               Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by 
               Duke and Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and crosses 
               to where they are sitting.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just 
                         passing through?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Nope, we're assigned heah.

               With which reminder we will abandon all indications of the 
               Maine accent.

                                     DUKE
                         Y'all were short a couple cutters 
                         and we're what the Army sent.

                                     HENRY
                         Don't you know the first thing you're 
                         supposed to do at a new post is 
                         present yourself to the commanding 
                         officer with your orders?

                                     DUKE
                         Reckon so, but we been boozing all 
                         day and you work up an appetite.

                                     HENRY
                              (taking out orders 
                              and handing Duke a 
                              copy)
                         You're welcome to one of these, 
                         whatever they are.

                                     DUKE
                              (finding his orders)
                         They give you copies to burn.

               Henry scans both papers to find what he considers the most 
               important part. There is a RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY in the 
               distance.

                                     HENRY
                         Good. You've both been working close 
                         to the front.

                                     DUKE
                              (listening to artillery)
                         Never this close.

                                     HENRY
                         They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I 
                         just got word. We have our slack 
                         periods but when the action starts, 
                         you'll have more work in twelve hours 
                         than a civilian surgeon does in a 
                         week.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye 
                         and Duke are here.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Henry)
                         That's right, pal. You just sit up 
                         front and sign the mail, and leave 
                         the cutting to us.

                                     HENRY
                         I may need you to go to work 
                         practically immediately. But meanwhile 
                         perhaps you'd like to meet some of 
                         your fellow officers.

                                     DUKE
                         Just one for a start.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         The blonde dish.

                                     HENRY
                         If you mean...
                              (looking toward 
                              Lieutenant Dish)
                         She is a lieutenant in the Army 
                         Nursing Corps, Captain.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's 
                         already... involved with somebody 
                         here.

                                     HENRY
                         They've all tried. Nobody's got to 
                         first base.

               He is interrupted by the fact that Dish and Knocko have risen 
               from their table and are passing right by them on their way 
               to the door.

               The Lieutenant has just as nice a walk as you would hope 
               for, and the men's eyes follow her till she is again out of 
               hearing distance.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Why bother with first base? I'd go 
                         right for the home run.

               The Painless Pole and Dago Red have come over.

                                     DAGO RED
                         This the new talent, Henry?

                                     HENRY
                         Captain Pierce, Captain Forrest... 
                         Father Mulcahy, the Catholic Chaplain 
                         of the area, and Captain Waldowski, 
                         our Dental Officer.

                                     PAINLESS
                         Better known as Painless Pole.

               Murrhardt and Bandini come over and all ADLIB introductions 
                asking each other their backgrounds, etc.

                                     BANDINI
                         We all call him Dago Red.

                                     DUKE
                         I'm Duke and he's Hawkeye.

                                     PAINLESS
                         Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic 
                         anytime you feel like playing a little 
                         poker, or even if a tooth is bothering 
                         you.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Poker sounds great. When do you play?

                                     MURRHARDT
                         He said anytime. Day and night, seven 
                         days a week. The players change but 
                         the game never stops.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Hawkeye and Duke)
                         You'll be living with Major Burns. 
                         O'Reilly!

               Before his name is uttered, Radar has already risen from the 
               enlisted men's group, and is now at Henry's side.

                                     RADAR
                         Sir?

                                     HENRY
                         Don't do that, Radar! You make me 
                         nervous.

                                     RADAR
                         Sir?

                                     HENRY
                         Don't come so quickly when I call. I 
                         want you to take these officers...

                                     RADAR
                         To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.

                                     HENRY
                         Stop that, O'Rielly!

                                     RADAR
                         Sir?

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, get out of here!

                                     RADAR
                         Yes, Colonel.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. / INT. "THE SWAMP" (PRESENTLY FRANK'S TENT)  DAY

               Hawkeye and Duke drag their bags from the Jeep, which Radar 
               drives away. They look over their new residence, a standard 
               army tent, square with peaked roof, a wooden door attached 
               to the canvas. Then as they approach it, they become aware 
               of a youthful Korean voice reading, in heavily accented 
               English, words that have no meaning for the speaker.

                                     HO-JON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         'Yea, though I walk through the valley 
                         of the shadow of death... '

                                     DUKE
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         One of his ancestors, I think.

                                     HO-JON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         'I shall fear no evil for Thou art 
                         with me...'

               They open the door of the tent and go in. There are three 
               canvas cots with sleeping bags on them, a plank floor, an 
               oil stove, electric light, a few crude shelves, one table 
               and one chair plus assorted crates serving as same.

               MAJOR FRANK BURNS, 35, from Wisconsin, is sitting on one of 
               the two more favorably situated cots listening to HO-JON, a 
               Korean boy of 16, read from the Bible. He corrects the word 
               that has given Ho-Jon the most trouble.

                                     FRANK
                         Thou. For Thou art with me.
                              (sees Duke and Hawkeye, 
                              jumps up)
                         Welcome, welcome, welcome!

                                     DUKE
                         What the hell's going on here?

                                     FRANK
                         This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our 
                         houseboy. I'm teaching him English.

                                     DUKE
                         Where's he gonna use that kind of 
                         talk? 'The valley of the shadow of 
                         death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...
                              (rummages in barracks 
                              bag)
                         I got something for you.

               He takes out sex magazine, gives it to Ho-Jon in such a way 
               that we see the nude on the cover, but Frank doesn't.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Frank)
                         Little light reading matter. Just 
                         right for his age.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Duke)
                         Well, southern boy, I suppose you 
                         want the sack that's convenient to 
                         the door.

                                     DUKE
                         And gets the wind every time it opens. 
                         No, thanks. I'll take that one.

               He indicates the unoccupied cot which, like Frank's, is at 
               the rear of the tent with the stove between it and the front 
               door. Hawkeye shrugs and reaches into his barracks bag.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Let's choose for it.
                              (finds baseball bat, 
                              hands it to Duke)
                         You toss.

               Duke tosses the bat vertically in the air. As it comes down 
               Hawkeye grabs it expertly at the tape with his left hand. 
               Duke puts his left hand above that, and Duke is left with 
               his right hand waving in the air with nothing to grab.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Ho-Jon)
                         Part of your education. Always use 
                         your own bat.

               He tosses Valpac onto the desired cot.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ADMITTING WARD  NIGHT

               It's pretty full already and more wounded are being brought 
               in by corpsmen. In contrast to the opening scene, where the 
               casualties were a generalized fact seen at a distance, in 
               this scene they are viewed individually and at close range, 
               and the effect, both on the eye and the ear, is almost 
               unbearable. Hawkeye, in a white gown as are all the surgeons 
               and nurses, moves from a patient he has just examined to one 
               who is letting out a number of unintelligible SOUNDS mixed 
               in with such clear and frequently repeated words as "Christ," 
               "Mother," "God damn" and "Please." As Hawkeye approaches, 
               Lieutenant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in

                         Two-man job. How much blood has he 
                         had?

                         Duke...

               Duke has just examined a patient. He takes a step towards 
               Hawkeye.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         This kid's ready but we won't know 
                         all the damage till we get in and 
                         see what's happened. What have you 
                         got?

                                     DUKE
                         Nothing can't wait. Shall we check 
                         it out with the Major?

               He indicates a Major who is standing a short distance away, 
               looking like a boss but not actually doing anything. Also in 
               Admitting Ward are, Murrhardt, Lieutenant Dish, PFC Seidman, 
               Corporal Judson.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Naw, I already found out. The only 
                         thing he doesn't like about being in 
                         charge is making decisions.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               NOTE: All principal cast should be available for all operating 
               scenes.

               There are three operations going on at once. Here all 
               personnel wear white caps and masks and it is hard to identify 
               individuals except that at close range we can distinguish 
               Hawkeye by his glasses and Duke by his eyes and his build. 
               They are working together with great efficiency and an 
               instinctive collaboration that seems to require no verbal 
               exchange. What we see them do, without necessarily recognizing 
               the portion of anatomy involved, is to cut out a section of 
               bowel damaged by a shell fragment, and start sewing the 
               divided ends together.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye and Duke are working together on the last stages of 
               a leg amputation. This time there is no doubt about the 
               surgical process we are watching; we see the almost severed 
               leg and the process of controlling bleeding; then the limb 
               is actually separated from its stump and handed by Duke to a 
               corpsman. Hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Hot pack.

               Watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it 
               out, he recognizes, despite cap and mask, that it is 
               Lieutenant Dish. His eyes linger on hers for a brief moment.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room, tears in 
               her eyes, trying to control her sobs, and moves just outside 
               the circle of light from the fixture over the entrance. There, 
               no longer under observation, she lets herself cry. Hawkeye 
               comes out the door, registers surprise at the sight of her 
               just as if he hadn't followed her out. He moves to her side 
               and puts a comforting arm around her.

               She looks up just long enough to see who it is, then buries 
               her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six 
                         months I've been here and there are 
                         still times when I can't stand it. I 
                         just go to pieces.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         There's nothing ridiculous about it.
                              (turns her face up to 
                              his)
                         A kid like you...

               She doesn't move her head from the way he has arranged it, 
               and her lips are very close to his. He kisses her and it 
               turns out, from the ardent way she responds, that's what she 
               wanted him to do.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Thank you, Captain Pierce.
                              (her voice full of 
                              need)
                         It's been so long.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         No trouble at all.
                              (then)
                         Hawkeye.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         How did you get called that?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only 
                         book my father ever read.

               He kisses her again and again she clings to him.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You're getting a workout, you and 
                         Captain Forrest, your first night.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It isn't always this rough?

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Oh, no. We have dull stretches every 
                         week or so, thank God, when there's 
                         nothing to do after midnight.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         They don't have to be dull. I mean 
                         if you and me put our minds 
                         together...

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Our minds?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         For a start. I just have a hunch... 
                         well, it isn't entirely a hunch...

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You're an attractive man.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You have a certain modest charm 
                         yourself.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                              (continuing her own 
                              thoughts)
                         But I'm married.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Something else we have in common.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Very happily married.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Same here.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         And absolutely determined to be 
                         faithful to my husband. Do we have 
                         that in common, Captain?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It's a matter of definition. Faithful 
                         in spirit, yes.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         I don't make the distinction. But 
                         the sex urge is a powerful force. In 
                         women just as much as men.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Ayuh.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You'd think now, with only six weeks 
                         before they ship me back home, it 
                         would be easier. But it isn't.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Of course not.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         It's terribly hard. Sometimes the 
                         temptation is just too much.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Then why not, as long as it wouldn't 
                         hurt anybody...?

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                              (not hearing him, 
                              just continuing her 
                              own thought)
                         But you've made me feel strong again, 
                         Captain. Hawkeye.
                              (smiling, tears gone, 
                              ready to return to 
                              work)
                         You helped me pull together when I 
                         needed it.

               With a grateful look at him, she goes back inside. Hawkeye 
               contemplates the accomplishment she has credited him with, 
               and finds it appalling.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye and Duke are working across the table from each other 
               again, this time inside a man's chest, stopping a hemorrhage 
               and debriding the wound.

                                     DUKE
                         Now that's what I call real pretty. 
                         We can close up here and go into his 
                         belly.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He can't take much more time on the 
                         table.

                                     DUKE
                         So we got to cut him fast. I figure 
                         from the X-ray it ain't just the 
                         spleen. We also got to snatch his 
                         right kidney.

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  MORNING

               Wearing fatigues now, Hawkeye and Duke are making their weary 
               way from the hospital to their tent after a night's work. 
               There is an announcement coming over the post-wide public 
               address system, but it doesn't concern them.

                                     SARGEANT VOLLMER'S VOICE
                              (over P.A.)
                         Captain Murrhardt, please report to 
                         the Colonel's office at the earliest 
                         opportunity. Captain Murrhardt.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  MORNING

               Ho-Jon throws a match into the oil stove, but it doesn't 
               work. He looks into it, strikes another match, and this time 
               it lights up so quickly he is almost singed by the flame. 
               Hawkeye and Duke open the door and come in. Ho-Jon straightens 
               and bows.

                                     HO-JON
                         Good morning, Captain Pierce and 
                         Captain Forrest.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You can cut the bow.

                                     HO-JON
                         I have not understood what you means.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (demonstrating bow)
                         That. It's out of the act.

               He and Duke remove their outer clothing during the ensuing:

                                     HO-JON
                         Because is not democrash? All peoples 
                         created equal?

                                     DUKE
                         Hey, you been sneaking some reading 
                         outside the frigging Bible!

                                     HO-JON
                         I have great interest for America, 
                         his peoples and his custom.

                                     DUKE
                         Good, because we got a fine old 
                         American custom we want to teach 
                         you. You know what these are?

               He gives Ho-Jon two bottles. The boy looks at the labels.

                                     HO-JON
                         Gin. I know, yes.
                              (reads other label)
                         Dry...

                              word)
                         ...vermouth.

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  MORNING

               Frank walks toward the tent from the direction of the 
               hospital.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  MORNING

               Frank opens the door and is taken aback by the sight of the 
               two bottles on the table and Ho-Jon filling glasses held by 
               Duke and Hawkeye, who have climbed into their sleeping bags. 
               He is so disturbed he fails to shut the door.

                                     FRANK
                         Is that liquor?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon 
                         to be a bartender. Join us?

                                     DUKE
                         But first will you please kindly 
                         shut the goddam door?

                                     FRANK
                         I don't drink intoxicants.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Duke)
                         Christ Almighty, I think he means 
                         it!

                                     DUKE
                         We been had.

                                     FRANK
                         I don't believe it's right for you 
                         to involve a boy who's not seventeen 
                         years old yet...

                                     DUKE
                         The door, Frank, the door! Where you 
                         from anyhow, Alaska?

                                     FRANK
                              (closing door)
                         Wisconsin.

                                     DUKE
                         Same general idea.

               Frank proceeds to take off his outer clothing preparatory to 
               retiring.

                                     HO-JON
                         Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go 
                         wash clothes.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.

                                     FRANK
                         So long, Ho-Jon.

                                     DUKE
                         You make a mean martini, kid.

               Ho-Jon goes out. Duke and Hawkeye settle back to enjoy their 
               drinks but they both come bolt upright when they see Frank 
               drop to his knees by his cot and begin to intone the Lord's 
               Prayer.

                                     FRANK
                         Our Father who art in Heaven Hallow'd 
                         be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy 
                         will be done, On earth as it is in 
                         Heaven...

               Hawkeye and Duke find it hard to believe their eyes and ears. 
               They never expected to see a grown man behaving as Frank is 
               now.

                                     FRANK
                         Give us this day our daily...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You ever caught this bread, and 
                         forgive our syndrome before, Duke?

                                     FRANK
                         ...trespasses as we forgive those 
                         who trespass against...

                                     DUKE
                         Us. Lead us not into...

                                     FRANK
                         ...No cases over the age of temptation 
                         but deliver us eight. from evil. For 
                         Thine is the kingdom, the power and...

                                     HAWKEYE & DUKE
                         ...the glory forever. Amen.
                              (raising martini 
                              glasses)
                         Amen!

                                     DUKE
                              (singing)
                         Onward Christian soldiers...

                                     DUKE & HAWKEYE
                              (singing)
                         Marching as to war. With the cross 
                         of Jesus going on before. Christ our 
                         Royal Master, leads against the foe. 
                         Forward into battle...

                                     DUKE
                              (breaking off singing, 
                              points to Frank)
                         He ain't finished!

               For a moment, before Hawkeye speaks, some of the words Frank 
               is mumbling come through.

                                     FRANK
                         ...And for our young men on the field 
                         of battle, that they may return home 
                         to their dear ones...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Come clean with us, Frank. Were you 
                         on this religious kick back home, or 
                         did you start to crack up here on 
                         the post?

                                     FRANK
                              (ignoring him)
                         ...And for our Supreme Commander 
                         over here and our Commander-in-Chief 
                         in Washington.

                                     DUKE
                         How long does the show go on, Frank?

               Frank turns his head toward Duke while remaining in praying 
               position.

                                     FRANK
                         It gets longer all the time. Now I 
                         have your soul to pray for, and 
                         Captain Pierce's.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. HENRY'S OUTER OFFICE  DAY

               Sargeant Vollmer is working on some papers at his desk when 
               Hawkeye and Duke come in. They pass right by him and head 
               for Henry's door.

                                     VOLLMER
                         Hey! That's a Colonel's office!

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (hand on Henry's door)
                         Ayuh. Just who we're looking for.
                              (opens door)
                         Henry, you got to do something!

               LESLIE exits from Henry's office as they enter.

               INT. HENRY'S OFFICE  DAY

               Henry is at his desk. Duke and Hawkeye come in and seat 
               themselves in informal comfort. Both watch Leslie exit.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We've stuck it out for a whole week 
                         now... Pretty girl.

                                     DUKE
                         We sure don't aim to cause any 
                         trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow 
                         on you.

                                     HENRY
                         You don't aim to cause any trouble  
                         But?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         But we strongly suspect something 
                         will happen to screw up this splendid 
                         organization of yours if you don't 
                         get that sky pilot out of our tent.

                                     HENRY
                         Your tent?

                                     DUKE
                         Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She 
                         don't seem the type to keep you awake 
                         praying.

                                     HENRY
                              (pause)
                         I have been in this Army a long time. 
                         I know just what you guys are up to. 
                         But there are limits...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We'll find out what they are when 
                         you throw us out.

                                     HENRY
                         That's all the commitment you're 
                         offering me?
                              (to Duke)
                         Or do you have some more extravagant 
                         gesture of cooperation?

                                     DUKE
                         No, Hawkeye just said it all.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Except we forgot one other small 
                         thing.

                                     DUKE
                         What's that?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         The chest-cutter.

                                     DUKE
                         Yeah, that's right.
                              (to Henry)
                         You better get us a chest-cutter 
                         before there's trouble.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         This outfit needs somebody who can 
                         find his way around the pulmonary 
                         anatomy when the bases are loaded.

                                     DUKE
                         And it's the ninth inning.

                                     HENRY
                         Forget it. No Mash unit has a chest 
                         surgeon and we aren't about to get 
                         one. Your housing problem I'll give 
                         some thought to in the next couple 
                         of weeks.

               Radar O'Reilly comes in with "Emergency" written all over 
               his expressive face. He makes a hand gesture to Henry that 
               could loosely be construed as a salute.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, O'Reilly?

                                     DUKE
                         How you, Radar?

                                     RADAR
                         They're running behind in the OR, 
                         sir, and the Preop Ward is all jammed 
                         up. Two choppers and three ambulances 
                         full.

               This is the most serious kind of crisis for the outfit, and 
               Henry's expression shows it.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Duke and Hawkeye)
                         You boys'll have to go to work early.

                                     DUKE
                         You fixing to add overtime to a twelve-
                         hour day? The union ain't gonna like 
                         it.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You work those kind of hours, you 
                         got to have rest. Which you can't 
                         get with somebody jabbering away on 
                         a direct line to heaven.

                                     HENRY
                              (crisply)
                         Major Burns will be out of your tent 
                         in twenty-four hours.
                              (to Radar)
                         Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain 
                         Forrest are on their way.

               Radar goes out. Duke gets to his feet and Hawkeye makes a 
               preliminary move toward doing so.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         About that chest-cutter...

                                     HENRY
                         I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask 
                         any more than that!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We don't want any more than that.
                              (following Duke out)
                         Right now.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  DUSK

               Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish are walking close together in an 
               otherwise deserted area.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Cold?

               He puts an arm around her without waiting for an answer. She 
               smiles at him fondly.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Even if I weren't.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Maria...

               He kisses her and they cling together, standing outside a 
               tent identified by a sign: "OFFICER'S CLUB."

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Oh, Hawkeye, I don't think I could 
                         stick it out these next few weeks 
                         without you.

               Hawkeye opens the door of the Officers' Club, looks in.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Nobody here.

               He steps aside to let her precede him in. There is nothing 
               inside except a pool table. She hesitates. He takes her in 
               his arms again, this time pressing his hands against the 
               seat of her fatigue pants.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You understand why I still can't...

               Ho-Jon appears in his line of vision, not hers.

                                     HO-JON
                         Captain Pierces...

               Hawkeye lets go of her, and they try to look like innocent 
               strollers.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?

                                     HO-JON
                         Finest kind. Captain Forrests say 
                         you better haul ass home quick. We 
                         got new chest-cutter in our tent.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. THE SWAMP  DUSK

               The wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it 
               as "THE SWAMP."

               INT. THE SWAMP  DUSK

               First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot, looking across the 
               tent at the newcomer. Attached to the canvas wall behind him 
               is a photograph of his wife and two sons, aged four and two. 
               Next we turn our attention to Duke on the adjoining cot 
               (formerly Frank's). He also has a family picture on display: 
               his wife, two-year-old daughter and an infant. Then we get 
               our first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN, their new tentmate, about 
               30, tall and very thin, his head pretty well hidden inside 
               the hood of a parka. He is using cellophane tape to install 
               one of the popular nude photos of the day (such as the one 
               of Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early 
               1950's).

               Completing the group is Ho-Jon, who sits on the floor, 
               silently taking in everything that is done or said.

               Finished with his decorating effort, Trapper reaches into 
               the depths of his parka to produce a can of beer. He digs 
               into the other side, finds an opener and opens the beer. 
               Then his head goes back inside the parka along with the can 
               as he takes a swig from it.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         Now I got you for a witness, I'm 
                         going to try again. So far all I 
                         dragged out of him is he's from 
                         Bahston and he's only been in the 
                         Army two months.
                              (to Trapper)
                         Where were you when they drafted 
                         you?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Home.

                                     DUKE
                         I mean, what were you doing? Were 
                         you a resident or on a staff 
                         someplace?

                                     TRAPPER
                         That's right.

                                     DUKE
                         Where?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Hospital.

                                     DUKE
                         Which hospital?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Back home.

                                     DUKE
                         Is there any reason why we shouldn't 
                         know the name of it?

                                     TRAPPER
                         No.
                              (a long swig of beer)
                         Or why you should.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Duke)
                         I think I've seen this nut somewhere.
                              (to Trapper)
                         Haven't I?

                                     TRAPPER
                         If you don't know what you've seen, 
                         why should I?

               Hawkeye is unsatisfied. He keeps staring at Trapper, sure 
               he's seen him before.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Trapper)
                         You ready to switch to a little tonic 
                         we generally take us about this time? 
                         Ho-Jon...

               Ho-Jon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a 
               hospital ice-bag, puts them into the pitcher along with gin 
               and a dash of vermouth.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Don't you use olives?

                                     DUKE
                         Where you think you are, boy? They 
                         probably never seen a olive in this 
                         country.

               Ho-Jon pours three water-glasses full of martini and starts 
               to distribute them.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Trapper)
                         That's the front up the road a few 
                         miles. We have to get by without 
                         some of the comforts of home.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I like an olive.

               He reaches into his parka, comes up with a bottle of olives, 
               takes one out and puts it into the martini Ho-Jon serves 
               him. Then, as Hawkeye and Duke gape at him, he offers them 
               the bottle.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               There are two operations going on, one of them being a simple 
               procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse. The other by 
               contrast is a very special event. Trapper is operating, 
               assisted by another surgeon, a couple of nurses, a corpsman, 
               and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK. Beside these actual 
               participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both 
               shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), Frank 
               and Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as 
               spectators.

               Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or 
               some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and 
               involving a large chest incision. We see enough of the process 
               to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area, 
               but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching, 
               especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an 
               operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.

               The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room 
               noises.

               Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assistants 
               and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for 
               us to hear.

               There are four stages to the action:

               1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive 
               audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by the 
               fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared 
               to attempt.

               2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance 
               with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his 
               way to his destination.

               3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The 
               suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper 
               is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries 
               have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and 
               hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and 
               accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive. 
               Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for 
               confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper 
               has the situation under control.

               4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his 
               satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon, 
               to close up. Henry's smile of relief is unsure and only 
               tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal that the job has 
               been done to perfection.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  DAY

               Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in 
               fatigues. Some enlisted men are tossing a football around. 
               One of them makes a wild throw and the ball rolls to a stop 
               at Trapper's feet. He stops to look at it and the other two 
               halt with him. Then very slowly, Trapper leans over and picks 
               up the ball, waving Hawkeye downfield.

               Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty 
               yards away, Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms. 
               Hawkeye just stands where he is, holding the ball, oblivious 
               of the enlisted men who want it back, as Trapper and Duke 
               continue toward him.

               Revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! 
                         Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat 
                         Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?

                                     DUKE
                         Sixteen times.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We didn't have a chance, little 
                         Androscoggin College against the Big 
                         Green, but there was this blizzard 
                         and we held then nothing nothing 
                         till the last twenty seconds. Then 
                         this great passer of theirs let one 
                         go, snow and all...

                                     TRAPPER
                         Lucky you didn't have your mouth 
                         open or it would have gone down your 
                         throat.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He's Trapper John! Only man in history 
                         who ever found fulfillment in the 
                         ladies' can of a Boston and Maine 
                         Railroad car! When the Conductor 
                         caught him in there with his Winter 
                         Carnival date, she screamed: 'He 
                         trapped me!' What have you been doing 
                         since those days, Trapper?

                                     DUKE
                         What does he have to do? A score 
                         like that, a man could just live on 
                         his reputation.

               The enlisted men, increasingly concerned about their football, 
               are muttering mutinously to each other. Hawkeye is too carried 
               away about Trapper's identity to notice this till Trapper 
               calls it to his attention.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         Ball.

               Hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men, and, 
               finally getting the point, throws it back to them.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (relieved to find 
                              another subject)
                         What gives over there?

               They look across the compound to the Shower Tent, behind 
               which an Army truck full of GIs has just pulled up. While 
               Hawkeye and Duke explain what's going on to Trapper, and the 
               three of them move in for a closer look, we see the visiting 
               GIs drop one by one from the rear of the truck, pay their 
               admission fees and take their places in the line leading up 
               to the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of 
               the tent.

                                     DUKE
                         Must be Painlees Pole Day in the 
                         Shower Tent.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Trapper)
                         You met him. Walt Waldowski, the 
                         Dental Officer.

                                     DUKE
                         Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.

                                     TRAPPER
                         What are they peeking at? Captain 
                         Waldowski in the shower?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Part of him. Painless is the owner 
                         and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. 
                         That's where he comes from...

                         Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed 
                         to have run up the highest lifetime

               EXT. SHOWER TENT  DAY

               Corporal Judson from Mississippi takes his turn at the 
               peephole. His speech is that of the rural southern black.

                                     JUDSON
                         Ah'd purely love to see it angry.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye and Duke are working on a patient about whose chances 
               their faces reveal extreme pessimism. The nurse in attendance 
               is Leslie.

               Hawkeye takes the patient's blood pressure and frowns at the 
               reading.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         This kid looks like a loser. Maybe 
                         we better get the bead-jiggler to 
                         put in a fix.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Leslie)
                         Call Dago Red.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Without interfering with the administration of blood and 
               other medical measures, Dago Red is just finishing giving 
               last rites to the patient.

                                     DAGO RED
                         ...May God remit unto thee the pains 
                         of the present and future life, open 
                         to thee the gates of heaven, and 
                         bring thee to everlasting life.
                              (makes the sign of 
                              the Cross)
                         May Almighty God bless thee, Father, 
                         Son and Holy Ghost.

                                     LESLIE
                              (taking patient's 
                              pulse)
                         Duke...

               She wants him to feel it and he does, reacting excitedly.

                                     DUKE
                         Slowing down!

               Hawkeye meanwhile is checking blood pressure again.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Going up. Nice work, Red.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  DAY

               Dago Red is the cocktail guest of the three Swampmen. Ho-Jon 
               sits in his usual place on the floor, following everything 
               that's said and refilling martini glasses wherever needed.

                                     DAGO RED
                         There's sort of a built-in prayer 
                         for the sick man to get well, but of 
                         course that's not the basic intention.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I don't care about the intention. I 
                         just know your Cross Action is a 
                         plus on our side. I've seen it come 
                         through four times.

                                     DUKE
                         And you've had a natural four times 
                         in a row in a crap game. Right? Does 
                         that mean...?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Not without lots of praying and 
                         kissing the dice.
                              (to Dago Red)
                         It's a different ritual but it works 
                         the same.

                                     DUKE
                         What do you think, Trapper?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Me? I was raised a mackerel-snapper...

               Dago Red gives him a quick, intent look, which Hawkeye notes.

                                     TRAPPER
                         ...But I turned in my knee pads.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Ho-Jon, give the Father some more 
                         martini.

                                     DAGO RED
                         Just a taste, Ho-Jon.
                              (to the group)
                         I'd better get to the point... what 
                         I came here for today.

                                     DUKE
                         You came because we asked you, for a 
                         drink.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We wanted to tell you how you were 
                         helping us with your fixes.

                                     DAGO RED
                         Well, sure, but I'm also worried 
                         about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His 
                         poker players got in an argument and 
                         asked him for a ruling, and he said 
                         what difference did it make, it was 
                         just a card game.

               It's obvious from the shocked reactions of the Swampmen that 
               the priest couldn't have reported a more ominous symptom.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I guess I'm getting a toothache I 
                         better have looked at.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DENTAL CLINIC  DAY

               There is no activity around the dental chair, but the nonstop 
               poker game is thriving as Hawkeye enters, carrying a bottle 
               in a paper bag. The players are evenly divided between 
               officers (UGLY JOHN, MURRHARDT and a visiting HELICOPTER 
               PILOT) and enlisted men (VOLLMER, RADAR and JUDSON).

                                     UGLY JOHN
                         Take a seat, Hawk. We can use a fresh 
                         pigeon.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Got to see the man about a tooth. 
                         Where is he?

                                     RADAR
                              (to Vollmer)
                         Call. With a pair of kings.
                              (to Hawkeye, pointing 
                              to smaller tent 
                              attached)
                         Inside.

               Hawkeye goes on into Painless' private quarters.

                                     VOLLMER
                              (indignantly, to Radar)
                         How can you call with one lousy pair? 
                         Ought to be a house rule against 
                         mind reading.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. PAINLESS' TENT  DAY

               Painless is lying on his back on the cot, staring blankly at 
               the ceiling. Hawkeye has poured drinks from his bottle and 
               is sipping his, but Painless' remains untouched.

                                     PAINLESS
                         If a man isn't a man anymore, what's 
                         he got left to live for?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Tell me the whole story, Walt.

                                     PAINLESS
                         There's this native broad works in 
                         the laundry. I don't know if you've 
                         noticed.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         There's only one worth noticing.

                                     PAINLESS
                         You noticed. I wasn't going to fool 
                         around over here. I've got these 
                         three girls I'm engaged to back 
                         home...

               He indicates three photographs of young women, displayed 
               with equal prominence. Any one of them could make Miss 
               America.

                                     PAINLESS
                         But I had this feeling I ought to 
                         make the effort. To test myself. And 
                         I flunked.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What did you have to test, for God's 
                         sake... the dental Don Juan of 
                         Detroit?

                                     PAINLESS
                         Don Juanism is just a cover... I've 
                         been reading up on it.
                              (emotionally overcome, 
                              turning away)
                         I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been 
                         living a lie!

               Moved by the intensity of his self-denunciation, Hawkeye 
               bends down close to Painless, puts a comforting hand on his 
               shoulder.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Painless, you mustn't talk that way. 
                         It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?

                                     PAINLESS
                         Homosexuality.

               Hawkeye straightens abruptly, his hand rising from Painless' 
               shoulder as from a hot stove.

                                     PAINLESS
                         Now I know that's been my problem 
                         since I was a kid. But it only caught 
                         up to me last night.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You've been drawn to other males? 
                         Since you were a kid?

                                     PAINLESS
                         No, never in the slightest.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Just in dreams?

                                     PAINLESS
                         Or in dreams either. I repressed it 
                         completely. Classic pattern of 
                         inhibition.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         That's what you've been doing all 
                         these years with every dame you could 
                         lay your hands on? Repressing your 
                         real self?

                                     PAINLESS
                         But it's all over now, and I can't 
                         face it. Imagine if you found out 
                         you were one, you wouldn't like 
                         breaking the news to your wife. Well, 
                         I got the same problem multiplied.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You don't have any problem. You've 
                         got thirty good years ahead of you, 
                         easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down 
                         as you grow older, get along with 
                         just two fiancees, but...

                                     PAINLESS
                         No, one thing I finally know for 
                         sure, I'll never function with a 
                         woman again.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  NIGHT

               Hawkeye is reporting to Duke and Trapper. Murrhardt and 
               Bandini are there, as well as Ho-Jon.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         There ought to be a law against 
                         dentists reading. Matter of fact, I 
                         thought there was. Anyway, this is 
                         an obsession. He can't be persuaded 
                         out of it.

                                     HO-JON
                              (appearing in doorway)

                         Don't mention the sex thing unless 
                         he brings it up.

               A perfunctory knock on the door is immediately followed by 
               the entrance of Painless.

                                     DUKE
                         How you, Walt? We was just fixing to 
                         have a nightcap.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Ho-Jon)
                         Pour one for Painless.

               Ho-Jon serves drinks all around. There is a silence as each 
               of the hosts tries to think of a conversational opening.

                                     PAINLESS
                         I thought you guys ought to know. 
                         I'm going to commit suicide.

               This leads to another silence, broken by Trapper, who doesn't 
               go so far as to stand up but leans way out from his sack to 
               grasp the dentist by the hand.

                                     TRAPPER

               INT. DAGO RED'S TENT  DAY

               The priest is sitting at his desk reading his breviary when 
               Hawkeye and Trapper enter. Trapper goes over to Red's beer 
               supply, opens it and distributes three cans while Hawkeye 
               greets their host.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         How they goin', Losing Preacher? 
                         What do you hear from the Pope?

                                     DAGO RED
                         You talked to Walt?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He's parted his moorings.

                                     TRAPPER
                         We're throwing him a Last Supper. We 
                         came to invite you.

                         The Painless Pole plans to cross the 
                         Great Divide tonight and we need 
                         your help to straighten him out.

                                     DAGO RED
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows 
                         he's loused himself with the Church, 
                         but it's part of our plan to make 
                         him think he has the keys to the 
                         kingdom. Which he will think if you 
                         grease the skids for him.

                                     DAGO RED
                         I don't think I can give absolution 
                         to a man who's about to commit 
                         suicide. It's a mortal sin.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What is, Red, the intention or the 
                         act?

                                     DAGO RED
                              (confused)
                         I believe it takes both. I'd have to 
                         look it up.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Just use common sense. Your job is 
                         preventing sin, and the way to do 
                         that is give him your best Cross 
                         Action.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Or you can let him knock himself 
                         out. You personally'd be sending him 
                         to his grave.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         An eternal damnation.

                              (feeling cornered)
                         I don't know. I'm not sure what the 
                         Military Vicar's office would think...

                                     TRAPPER
                         They sure as hell won't hear about 
                         it from us.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DENTAL CLINIC  NIGHT

               The poker table, and dental chair have been removed to make 
               room for two long tables from the Mess Hall. At these a 
               sumptuous, candlelit, stag banquet is coming to an end. The 
               guests are doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots 
               and enlisted men. Duke is on his feet, raising a glass of 
               champagne in a toast. (All our male cast except Henry and 
               Frank)

                                     DUKE
                         Y'all come here to say a final goodbye 
                         to our old friend Walt. But maybe it 
                         ain't so final. Maybe he's just going 
                         on ahead into the Unknown to do a 
                         little recon job for us all.

               During this tribute the guests rise, their eyes on the guest 
               of honor, who sits with his food untouched, a vacant 
               expression on his face. When Duke has finished and everyone 
               has drunk the toast, they applaud and sit down again. Trapper 
               raps for attention and indicates Hawkeye, who rises.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I just got this one thing to say. 
                         Nobody ordered Walt to take on this 
                         mission. He volunteered, for certain 
                         death. That's what we award our 
                         highest medal for. That's what being 
                         a soldier is all about.

               Except for Painless himself, the gathering is deeply moved 
               by this thought, some of them to the point of tears. Again 
               Trapper restores order.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Only one man here can add anything 
                         to that.

               He looks to Dago Red, who stands up, dressed for the first 
               time in the priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass. He 
               walks to where Painless sits and there begins the viaticum 
               (holy communion for those in danger of death).

                                     DAGO RED
                         Receive, my brother, this food for 
                         your journey...

               A coffin, borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red 
               is still speaking, is lined with blankets, equipped with a 
               pillow for comfortable reclining prior to the onset of death, 
               and furnished with mementos of Painless' earthly career: two 
               fresh decks of cards, a box of poker chips, a fifth of scotch, 
               some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his 
               three fiancees. It is set down on the floor next to Painless, 
               who regards it with the first show of interest he has 
               manifested during the proceedings.

                                     DAGO RED
                              (bestowing the sacred 
                              host)
                         ...The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
                         that He may guard you from the wicked 
                         enemy and lead you into everlasting 
                         life. Amen.

               Red is making the sign of the Cross when Painless' curiosity 
               asserts itself.

                                     PAINLESS
                         What the hell's that?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Coffin. Yours.

                                     PAINLESS
                         I'm not even dead yet.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You're a pretty heavy guy to lug 
                         around. Be a hell of a lot more 
                         convenient for everybody if you got 
                         into the box as soon as you've taken 
                         the capsule.

               He produces and opens a small box, inside which, surrounded 
               by pure white cotton, a black capsule is displayed like a 
               rare jewel. Dago Red, meanwhile, preferring not to know what 
               happens from here on, makes his way out.

                                     PAINLESS

                              capsule)
                         How do you take it?

                         With whiskey. A good swallow first 
                         and a big one afterwards. Speeds it 
                         into the bloodstream.

               Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand, the capsule 
               with the other. He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey, then, 
               with the capsule in front of his face, hesitates.

                                     PAINLESS

                         best.

                         You want it straight? Medical history 
                         records no instance of anyone taking

                         Here goes nothing.

               He pops the capsule into his mouth and washes it down with a 
               large drink of whiskey. Hawkeye gestures to the waiting 
               coffin. Painless gets up and lowers himself into it.

                         I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for 
                         me, what's heaven really like?

                                     TRAPPER
                         It's a bedroom where a man is always 
                         at his peak and doesn't have to take 
                         any time outs.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         And all the angels are built like 
                         Lieutenant Dish.

               The Last Supper guests are filing by the coffin, bending low 
               to shake Painless' hand and murmur words of farewell.

                                     DUKE
                         Drink up, Walt. One for the glory 
                         road.

               He holds the glass to Painless' lips, helps him down the 
               rest of the whiskey.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. POSTOP WARD  NIGHT

               Hawkeye finishes checking a patient, looks to doorway and 
               sees lieutenant Dish standing there. He crosses to join her.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Thanks for coming, Maria.
                              (takes her arm and 
                              leads her through 
                              exit)
                         Sorry it had to be so late.

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  NIGHT

               Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish walk from the Postop Ward.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You're leaving tomorrow?

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         In less than twelve hours I'll be on 
                         my way.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         That's when the real strain starts. 
                         Three weeks on a troopship.
                              (embraces her)
                         Poor baby.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                              (kissing him)
                         Dear, sweet Hawkeye.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Though I guess who it'll really be 
                         rough on is your husband.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You're on his side all of the sudden?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         A man would be more considerate. He 
                         wouldn't come home to his wife a 
                         nervous wreck.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         How would he avoid it... as if I 
                         needed to ask?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It could be a purely impersonal thing. 
                         What matters is the therapeutic value 
                         of relieving your tensions.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You should have been a marriage 
                         counselor.
                              (drawing his head 
                              closer to hers)
                         But I'll show you what's wrong with 
                         your theory.

               They kiss passionately. Dish is shaken by it and that shows 
               in her voice when she continues making her point.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         Do you think anything between us 
                         could be impersonal? Or pure? You 
                         better forget logic, because you're 
                         proving why I shouldn't go to bed 
                         with you.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (after a moment of 
                              massive internal 
                              struggle)
                         I didn't mean with me.

               It takes a couple of seconds for what he has said to penetrate 
               her consciousness. She looks at him incredulously.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You're asking for somebody else?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It happens to be a matter of life 
                         and death.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         A man is going to die if he doesn't 
                         have my fair young body?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have 
                         the same privilege that comes on 
                         rare occasions to the chief executive 
                         of some state or nation... the 
                         privilege of restoring life, by one 
                         tender act of mercy, to a doomed 
                         fellow creature.

               While he is speaking, a blue light goes on in a tent in the 
               background. As they turn to see what is going on, four men 
               carrying a heavy box approach the tent.

               EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT (OFFICER'S CLUB)

               At closer range the box is revealed to be Painless' coffin 
               with the departed dentist inside it. The four men who carry 
               it into the tent are Radar, Judson, Boone and Seidman. This 
               tent doesn't have a wooden door like the Swamp, just a flap.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT

               The four enlisted men carry the coffin, empty, out of the 
               tent. Then Hawkeye and Dish appear, moving slowly toward the 
               tent as he continues to break down her resistance.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He should come to now for a while, 
                         but he's got so much dope in him by 
                         tomorrow he won't know fact from 
                         fantasy.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         You think he won't.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What do you care? You'll be on your 
                         way to Japan.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel 
                         terrible if anything happened to 
                         him...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It's your decision, Maria. I don't 
                         want to high-pressure you.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         I'd be crazy to think my virtue, 
                         such as it is, was more important 
                         than his life...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         In fact I'd rather not try to 
                         influence you at all.
                              (opening tent flap)
                         Let's just go in and take a look, 
                         and then you think it through for 
                         yourself.

               INT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT

               The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their 
               disposal  cushions, parachute cloth, mirrors and little 
               touches of elegance gathered from all over the post  to 
               resemble a luxurious bedroom on the home front. Lying in bed 
               (the pool table) between clean, inviting sheets is Painless. 
               The boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare 
               shoulders. Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads her to 
               the side of the bed.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         One last look at him...
                              (raises sheet, 
                              uncovering Painless 
                              to the knees)
                         ...still alive...
                              (slips raised sheet 
                              into Dish's grasp)
                         ...the whole man.

               Dish's eyes pop at what she sees. So astounded is she that 
               she doesn't notice Hawkeye has given her the sheet and made 
               off.

                                     LIEUTENANT DISH
                         My God, Hawkeye, I never realized... 
                         I never even dreamed...
                              (becoming aware he's 
                              no longer at her 
                              side)
                         Hawkeye! Hawk...

               She finds he's disappeared altogether. She can't resist 
               turning her gaze back to the uncovered Painless. Then she 
               drops the sheet.

               EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT  NIGHT

               The tent flap drops into place, continuing the movement of 
               the sheet. Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent 
               to its peak, which points firmly upwards.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. THE SWAMP  MORNING

               There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead. Hawkeye emerges 
               from the tent to look at it, verifying that it is coming 
               from the peaceful south rather than the embattled north. 
               Then he sees Lieutenant Dish coming out of her tent, wearing 
               her Army uniform and followed by one of the enlisted men 
               carrying her bags. Hawkeye waves goodbye but Dish doesn't 
               see him. Her face, seen up close, has a serene, faraway look, 
               neither happy nor unhappy, but enriched by experience.

               Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him; 
               he understands it's a question of preoccupation and not a 
               deliberate snub. He starts across the compound to the Mess 
               Hall, noting that the helicopter is descending to land on 
               the far side of the hospital.

               EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  MORNING

               There is a small welcoming party on hand, headed by Henry 
               himself, to greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter. 
               When it lands the door is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will 
               soon be known) gets out smartly, which is the way she does 
               everything. Her official name is Major Margaret Houlihan and 
               she is tallish, willowish, blondish, fortyish, prettyish. 
               She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake hands. The 
               others in the greeting party are out of the habit of saluting, 
               and have to be reminded by a stern look from their Commanding 
               Officer.

               As Henry and Hot Lips, followed by the others, head for the 
               hospital entrance, Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted 
               man behind her.

               She gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after 
               her. A moment later the chopper is airborne again.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

               One of the first people Hawkeye sees in the officer's section 
               is Painless, who is eating an enormous breakfast with great 
               gusto.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Morning Painless. How they goin'?

                                     PAINLESS
                         Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.

               INT. POSTOP WARD  DAY

               Frank is listening gravely to a wounded soldier's heartbeat 
               through a stethoscope. Standing by awaiting orders is Private 
               Boone. Frank has a disturbed reaction to the lack of vital 
               signs from the patient.

                                     FRANK
                              (to Boone)
                         Get me one c.c. of adrenaline and a 
                         cardiac needle.

                                     BOONE
                         What's a...?

                                     FRANK
                         Never mind questions. Get them!

               As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he 
               is supposed to perform, Trapper, a couple of beds away, in 
               the soiled fatigues he wears on nonoperating room duty, can 
               see and hear what is going on. While he watches, Frank checks 
               the patient further and establishes that he is dead. With a 
               disappointed sigh, he drops the man's lifeless arm and throws 
               the bedcovers back over him up to his neck.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               Henry is showing Hot Lips through the hospital and introducing 
               her to personnel. At the moment he is presenting Knocko.

                                     HENRY
                         Captain Williams, Major.
                              (to Knocko)
                         Major Houlihan is our new Chief Nurse.

               Knocko holds out her hand in friendly greeting, and is 
               startled to find Hot Lips expects a salute instead.

               INT. POSTOP WARD  DAY

               Trapper, having observed Frank's recognition of the fact his 
               patient is dead, is unprepared for what the Major does when 
               Boone comes running back with a syringe, a small vial and an 
               ordinary hypodermic needle.

                                     BOONE
                              (anxiously)
                         This what you wanted, Major?

                                     FRANK
                              (looking at vial)
                         No, you idiot. I said adrenaline. 
                         And a cardiac needle.

               He turns back to the patient and goes all over again through 
               the same checking process he followed before.

                                     BOONE
                              (desperately)
                         I'll ask a nurse!

                                     FRANK
                         It's too late. You killed him, Boone.

               A ghastly look appears on Boone's face. He tries to say 
               something, can't get it out, and bursts into tears instead. 
               Then additionally ashamed of himself for this weakness, he 
               runs out. Frank, deciding not to discipline the boy for the 
               display of unsoldierly conduct, is proceeding about his 
               business when Trapper accosts him.

                                     TRAPPER
                         You got a moment, Frank?

               He indicates the Utility Room, which leads off the Operating 
               Room and the Postop Ward. When Frank assents, Trapper opens 
               the door and ushers him in.

               INT. UTILITY ROOM  DAY

               It's a small room containing, among other items, a table 
               with a pot of coffee and cups which are available to medical 
               personnel at all hours.

                                     TRAPPER
                         You all through work for the day?

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, I am. Why do you want to know?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Make sure you got time to sleep this 
                         off.

               He puts his whole hundred and thirty pounds behind a right 
               uppercut that lands squarely on Frank's jaw. At the same 
               instant the door from the Operating Room opens, and Henry 
               gallantly makes way for Hot Lips to precede him.

                                     HENRY
                         This is the...

               Frank drops to the floor, momentarily knocked out.

                                     HENRY
                         T-Trapper!... C-C-Captain McIntyre... 
                         what the hell... ?

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (staring at Trapper 
                              incredulously)
                         That's a captain?

               Frank is coming to and could probably get back into the fight 
               by a count of eight if he had any desire to.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Trapper)
                         What's going on? Who started this?

                                     TRAPPER
                         You mean who hit who?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, that's what I mean.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I did. First and only blow. So far.

                                     FRANK
                              (getting up)
                         He wouldn't have touched me if I'd 
                         had my guard up. Let us settle this 
                         between ourselves, Colonel. Alone.

                                     HENRY
                         What do you think I'm running, an 
                         English boarding school? McIntyre, 
                         you're under arrest. Confine yourself 
                         to quarters, pending an investigation.

                                     TRAPPER
                         If you say so, Henry. But remember 
                         my claustrophobia.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Hot Lips)
                         I deeply regret this unfortunate 
                         incident. We try to remember we're a 
                         military organization.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I certainly would have thought so.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  NIGHT

               Henry is standing indignantly over Trapper, who is sipping a 
               beer in his sleeping bag. Duke, Hawkeye and Ho-Jon are 
               witnesses to the encounter.

                                     HENRY
                              (yelling)
                         What's wrong with you?

                                     TRAPPER
                         I don't know. I must have lost my 
                         punch. I didn't think the son-of-a-
                         bitch would get up.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. 
                         You know Trapper wouldn't sock him 
                         without a good reason.

                                     HENRY
                         There's no reason good enough for 
                         one medical officer to strike another.

                                     DUKE
                         That there Frank Burns is a menace. 
                         Whenever a patient croaks on him 
                         it's either God's will or somebody 
                         else's fault.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         This time he did it to a kid who's 
                         simple enough to believe him. Why 
                         don't you dump the mother, Henry? He 
                         creates more work than he gets done.

                                     HENRY
                         I should fire him because he got in 
                         the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've 
                         put up with a lot from you guys, but 
                         now I finally have to take 
                         disciplinary action.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Christ. All of a sudden it's West 
                         Point.

                                     DUKE
                         What are you going to do with him?

                                     HENRY
                         Well...
                              (to Trapper)
                         I was going to name you Chief 
                         Surgeon...
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         To consult on both shifts, yours and 
                         Frank's.

                                     DUKE
                         Hey, that's great, Henry! Good 
                         thinking!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         First decent idea you've had in a 
                         month.

                                     HENRY
                         Now I'll have to wait at least a 
                         week. If I announced it tomorrow, 
                         after what our new Chief Nurse saw 
                         this afternoon, they'd hear her 
                         yelling from Seoul to Washington.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

               Hot Lip's handsome face is relaxed into her most charming 
               smile as she approaches Hawkeye at the table where he sits 
               by himself having a late breakfast after a long night's work. 
               Hawkeye (like Trapper and Duke) no longer makes any attempt 
               at a proper military appearance.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Captain Pierce, would I be 
                         imposing...?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Honey, nobody as pretty as you could 
                         ever impose... please sit down. 
                         Coffee?

               He offers her some from the pot beside him, and she holds 
               out a cup while he pours it.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Captain, I've been observing the 
                         nurses on your shift. But naturally 
                         your own opinion is more informed 
                         than mine.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I'm glad you feel that way, Major, 
                         because you see it's a team effort... 
                         doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and 
                         I feel responsible for my whole team, 
                         and I want you to know I'm satisfied 
                         with them.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         All of them?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         That's right. We work well together.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Major Burns is far from satisfied.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         That don't surprise me. If you're a 
                         good observer, you must have observed 
                         by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         On the contrary, I've observed he's 
                         not only a good technical surgeon, 
                         he's a good military surgeon. And 
                         that includes how a man dresses and 
                         how he bears himself and his sense 
                         of what it means to be an officer in 
                         the United States Army.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         And his track record, that don't 
                         count? Look, honey, when you watch 
                         the two shifts try to notice which 
                         one does the most work with the least 
                         fuss.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I've noticed that both nurses and 
                         enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly 
                         to you but...

                                     HOT LIPS
                         That kind of familiarity is 
                         inconsistent with maximum efficiency 
                         in a military organization.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Okay, Major, honey.
                              (pushes back his chair)
                         I'm going to have a couple shots 
                         scotch and go to bed. I'd normally 
                         ask you to join me but obviously 
                         you're a female version of the routine 
                         Regular Army clown. And that turns 
                         me off, so just leave my outfit alone 
                         and we'll get along fine.
                              (stands up to go)
                         See you around the campus.

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (icily)
                         I wonder how a degenerated person 
                         like you could have reached a position 
                         of responsibility in the Army Medical 
                         Corps.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Sister, if I knew the answer to that 
                         I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. / INT. MESS HALL  DAY (SNOW ON GROUND)

               People are going in and out of the Mess Hall, when an 
               announcement comes over the public address system.

                                     VOLLMER'S VOICE
                              (over P.A. system)
                         Attention, everybody. I have an 
                         announcement. 'Effective today, 
                         Thirteen April, Captain John S. 
                         McIntyre, U.S. Army Reserve, is 
                         appointed Chief Surgeon at 4077th 
                         Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. Henry 
                         B. Blake, Commanding Officer.'
                              (informally, on his 
                              own)
                         Nice going, Trapper.

               Ugly John and Captain Bandini shake Trapper's hand in 
               congratulations. The only two officers in the outfit who 
               don't like the news come out of the Mess Hall together: Major 
               Burns and Houlihan.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         There's no point appealing to Colonel 
                         Blake. They've got him bewitched.

                                     FRANK
                         No. The only thing to do is write 
                         General Hammond.
                              (knowing perfectly 
                              well she has her own 
                              tent)
                         But it's hard to find a place around 
                         here for a private discussion.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I have a tent to myself.

                                     FRANK
                         People will talk.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I don't mind. If we give them 
                         something to talk about.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. HOT LIP'S TENT  NIGHT

               Hot Lips finishes reading the letter she and Frank have 
               drafted, signs it and stands up as she folds it and puts it 
               in a prepared envelope.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I think it's a marvelous letter.

                                     FRANK
                         We're a good team.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         We think the same way.

                                     FRANK
                         It's supper time.
                              (as casually as he 
                              can say it)
                         But you're not hungry are you?

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Ravenous. What about you?

                                     FRANK
                              (trying to hide his 
                              disappointment)
                         Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Anyway, we want to get this letter 
                         off.

               He grabs her and kisses her and from her reaction we get a 
               clear picture of the kind of female she is. She responds to 
               the kiss fervently, pressing her lips and body against his, 
               but the moment she decides to end it she switches right back 
               to her businesslike manner.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         The sooner it reaches him, the sooner 
                         we can turn this into a tight military 
                         outfit.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING  AT MAIL DEPOSIT BOX  NIGHT

               Frank deposits the letter in the box while Hot Lips stands 
               by. Then they proceed on their way to the Mess Hall, unaware 
               that they have been observed by Radar on the other side of 
               the partition into which the mailbox is set.

               INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING  NIGHT

               Radar picks up the letter Frank deposited and reads the 
               address.

               INT. THE SWAMP  NIGHT

               There is a party going on. Present, in addition to the three 
               occupants, are Painless, Ugly John, Bandini, Judson, Vollmer, 
               Ho-Jon, Boone, Murrhardt and Seidman. Radar enters, engages 
               Hawkeye's attention and shows him the letter. Hawkeye glances 
               through it, looks to Radar for confirmation and, getting it, 
               tears up the letter. Meanwhile under Duke's leadership, a 
               bedpan is affixed with adhesive tape to Trapper's head.

                                     DUKE
                         Hail to the chief! We-all got a 
                         responsibility, men. He's crowned 
                         like a king ought to be, but he can't 
                         just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. 
                         He has to be carried by native 
                         bearers.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Good thinking, Duke. How about it, 
                         Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of 
                         the boys?

                                     HO-JON
                         I don't get what you mean, native 
                         bearers.

                                     MURRHARDT
                         Bear is the same thing as carry.

                                     HO-JON
                         It's the other word I'm not sure.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (afraid of where this 
                              is leading)
                         Never mind. Forget it.

                                     DUKE
                              (simultaneously)
                         A native is someone who is born in a 
                         particular place.

                                     HO-JON
                         And if I go to New York, the natives 
                         there will carry me? I don't think 
                         so.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I don't think so either.

                                     DUKE
                         I don't think I should have opened 
                         my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.

                                     HO-JON
                              (smiling)
                         That's okay. Live a little, learn a 
                         little.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MESS HALL  NIGHT

               Frank and Hot Lips, sitting by themselves in a corner are 
               disgusted, and the rest of the people there are mildly amused, 
               by the spectacle of Trapper's entrance. The new Chief Surgeon, 
               still wearing his bedpan crown, is borne in on his cot by 
               Hawkeye, Duke, Painless and Ugly John. They set him down and 
               break into song.

                                     DUKE, HAWKEYE, PAINLESS AND UGLY JOHN
                              (singing)
                         Hail to the Chief And King of all 
                         the surgeons He needs a queen To 
                         satisfy his urgin's.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (loudly, pointing at 
                              Hot Lips)
                         I'd like to try out that one over 
                         there.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Very well, Your Majesty.
                              (starting toward Frank 
                              and Hot Lips)
                         Congratulations, Frank. He picked 
                         you.

                                     TRAPPER
                         No, no, that one.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Oh, you want to play it straight?
                              (to Hot Lips)
                         I guess I owe you an apology.

               Her eyes blazing with indignation, Hot Lips gets up and stalks 
               out.

               Frank follows her.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. HOT LIPS' TENT  NIGHT

               Frank is sitting next to Hot Lips on her cot with a soothing 
               arm around her.

                                     FRANK
                         Godless buffoons, all of them.

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (her hands on his 
                              face, turning it 
                              towards her)
                         It's that disrespect for you, that's 
                         what I can't forgive them.

                                     FRANK
                         Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me 
                         sore is how they behave towards you.
                              (pulling her into a 
                              tight embrace)
                         They ought to be grateful to have 
                         you.
                              (kisses her, his hand 
                              vanishing beneath 
                              her skirt)
                         I certainly am.

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (undoing one of his 
                              buttons and sliding 
                              her hand under his 
                              blouse)
                         And I'm grateful for you, Frank, 
                         especially with those boors around. 
                         We've grown very close in a short 
                         time.

               He kisses her around the neck and bosom, removing such of 
               the clothing as gets in the way.

                                     FRANK
                         It isn't just chance, I'm sure of 
                         that. God meant us to find each other.

               Instead of lingering on a scene that threatens to become 
               pornographic, our attention is drawn down beneath Hot Lips' 
               cot, where a strange object is being inserted under the canvas 
               wall of the tent. It is a microphone.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         His will be done.
                              (then, in excited 
                              response to an 
                              inflammatory move on 
                              his part)
                         Da-a-arling!

               EXT. HOT LIPS' TENT  NIGHT

               Radar, who has just planted the microphone, lets a coil of 
               wire spin out as he moves away.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. HENRY'S OUTER OFFICE  NIGHT

               Gathered here illicitly, in what is not only Sergeant 
               Vollmer's domain but the communication hub of the post, are 
               Trapper, Duke, Radar and Ugly John. They are listening, on 
               their own private speaker, to what is being said in Hot Lips' 
               tent.

                                     HOT LIPS' VOICE
                              (over speaker)
                         Frank... Frank... Frank... Frank... 
                         Frank...

                                     DUKE
                         What'd'y'all reckon he's doing to 
                         her?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Casting her horoscope.

                                     FRANK'S VOICE
                              (over speaker)
                         Give me your lips, love. Set me on 
                         fire.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Radar)
                         Plug it in, boy. We got no call to 
                         be selfish with a show like this.

               Radar accordingly transfers the lead from the microphone to 
               the outlet for the post loudspeaker system.

               EXT. ENLISTED MEN'S TENTS  NIGHT

               The occupants of one tent are engaged in a crap game, while 
               the men in the adjoining one are settling down for the night. 
               They are all dumbfounded to hear Hot Lips' voice over the 
               public address speakers.

                                     HOT LIPS' VOICE
                              (over speaker)
                         I want you to make love to me all 
                         night. I don't want anything to take 
                         you away from me.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye is performing surgery on a patient, assisted by 
               Captain Bandini. Both doctors and Leslie, the nurse working 
               with them, have stopped to listen to the lovers' dialogue 
               coming over the OR speaker.

                                     FRANK'S VOICE
                              (over speaker)
                         Nothing can, with the Colonel gone. 
                         I'm in charge tonight.

               INT. HOT LIPS' TENT  NIGHT

               Frank is on top of Hot Lips and, though the details of their 
               amorous activity are hidden under the covers, we can see 
               enough to know it is reaching a climax.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         I like a man who is in charge.

               Each word she speaks is instantly echoed on the speaker system 
               so that the word "charge" is still sounding after she has 
               finished saying it. She suddenly realizes there is something 
               wrong, though she doesn't immediately figure out what it is.

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (disturbed)
                         Frank...

                                     FRANK
                         Don't stop now! Please...

               The word "please" is repeated so distinctly outside that, 
               while Frank in his critical condition remains unaware of it, 
               Hot Lips sits bolt upright, pushing him aside.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Wait a second...

                                     FRANK
                         I can't... couldn't.

               EXT. FRONT OF THE 4077TH  DAY

               A Jeep driven by Henry pulls up near the hospital entrance, 
               from which Radar emerges to meet him. Leslie also joins them.

                                     RADAR
                         Good morning, Colonel.

                                     HENRY
                         Morning, Radar. How were things?

                                     RADAR
                         Splendid, sir. No problems.

                                     HENRY
                         Morning, Captain.

                                     LESLIE
                         Morning, Colonel.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

               Hot Lips is finishing breakfast at a table with some of the 
               other nurses. Frank is sitting near her but at another table 
               with a handful of male officers, including Hawkeye directly 
               opposite him.

               Duke and Trapper enter together as Hot Lips rises to leave.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (cheerily, to nurses)
                         Morning, girls. Good morning Major.

                                     HOT LIPS
                              (coldly)
                         Good morning.

                                     DUKE
                         Hiya, Frank. Hiya, Hot Lips.

               Duke and Trapper continue on their way to their table in the 
               officers' section. Frank reacts angrily and is about to go 
               after Duke when Hot Lips touches his shoulder and speaks in 
               a low tone.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         No, leave all the rowdiness to them. 
                         Calm down, drink your coffee.

               Hawkeye probably can't make out her exact words, but his 
               gaze follows her as she goes out the open door. The he looks 
               at Frank, bending low across the table as if he, too, had 
               something confidential to say, but actually speaking quite 
               distinctly.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Tell me, Frank, is that stuff you're 
                         tapping any good?

               Frank reacts with such rage he can't speak for a moment.

               EXT. MESS HALL  DAY

               Henry, Leslie and Radar, passing by the Mess Hall entrance, 
               encounter Hot Lips on her way out. Her salute catches Henry 
               by surprise, but he makes a quick stab at returning it though 
               his attention is on what he sees through the Mess Hall 
               windows.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Radar)
                         Hawkeye and Frank Burns. That's 
                         encouraging.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

               Hawkeye, who can see Henry outside (which Frank can't), 
               affects surprise at receiving no answer to his question.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I was just asking...

                                     FRANK
                         Shut up or I'll tear you apart.

               EXT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     HENRY
                         Can you make out what they're talking 
                         about?

                                     RADAR
                         I can try, sir.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I only wanted to know what she's 
                         like in the sack. Do those big boobs 
                         hold up or are they kind of droopy?

               EXT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     RADAR
                              (to Henry)
                         Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion 
                         on a point of anatomy.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Also I'm curious whether she's a 
                         moaner or...

                                     FRANK
                         Say that again and I'll kill you.

               EXT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     RADAR
                         The Major wishes to have the question 
                         repeated.

               INT. MESS HALL  DAY

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You know, does she go in for sound 
                         effects...?

               He keeps a wary eye on Frank while talking, and thus is able 
               to duck the coffee pot Frank hurls at him. From where Henry 
               stands in the doorway, this act of unprovoked aggression is 
               astonishing enough, for he can see Hawkeye innocently eating 
               his cereal, but the Colonel is even more amazed when Frank 
               follows it by springing across the table onto Hawkeye and 
               raining blows on him. Hawkeye puts up no resistance but simply 
               covers his head and screams.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Help! He's gone mad! Help, somebody!

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  DAY

               Two MPs are dragging Frank in a straitjacket to an MP Jeep. 
               They load him into the back and one of them gets in alongside 
               him while the other takes the wheel.

               Watching the MPs drive off with their prisoner are Henry, 
               Duke and Trapper.

                                     DUKE
                         Fair's fair, Henry. If I get into 
                         Hot Lips and jump Hawkeye Pierce, do 
                         I get to go home, too?

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY INDUCTION CENTER IN SEOUL  DAY 
               (SNOW IS GONE)

               It is now February. A jeep with Hawkeye at the wheel, Ho-Jon 
               beside him, drives up to the entrance. Hawkeye gives Ho-Jon 
               a final instruction as the boy gets out of the Jeep and goes 
               into the building. Hawkeye finds a place to park in the shade. 
               Lieutenant Scorch is with them.

                                     LIEUTENANT SCORCH
                         It was really nice of you to take me 
                         along.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I didn't have much choice.

                                     LIEUTENANT SCORCH
                         You really say the cutest things.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Yeah!

               INT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER  DAY

               The locale is established by the presence of military 
               personnel in uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR, 
               with the aid of one assistant, is examining in quick 
               succession a long line of naked young Korean boys. Ho-Jon's 
               turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the process is: a 
               brief overall scrutiny for visible defects, a blood pressure 
               reading, and the application of a stethoscope to a few key 
               spots. Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by 
               the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethoscope 
               to the boy's heart. He turns to check the blood pressure 
               figure which his assistant is about to record on the form he 
               has taken from Ho-Jon.

               Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the 
               heartbeat, and the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for 
               military service.

                                     KOREAN DOCTOR
                              (to assistant, in 
                              Korean)
                         We can't take this one. His heartbeat 
                         is much too fast, and his blood 
                         pressure is dangerously high.
                              (to Ho-Jon)
                         Have you ever seen a doctor before?
                              (abruptly, to assistant)
                         Wait a minute! What does it say there 
                         about where he's been working?
                              (takes Ho-Jon's form 
                              and reads the 
                              information for 
                              himself; then, to 
                              assistant)
                         Get the check on his urine sample 
                         right away.
                              (to Ho-Jon)
                         You'll have to wait around for a 
                         while, young man. I need some more 
                         information before I talk to you 
                         again.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER  DAY

               Hawkeye, with Lieutenant Scorch, waiting in the Jeep, is 
               startled at being addressed by a stranger, whom he recognizes 
               as the doctor that examined Ho-Jon. Ho-Jon is with him.

                                     KOREAN DOCTOR
                              (in English)
                         You please excuse...
                              (as Hawkeye turns and 
                              sees them)
                         I have been making examination of 
                         this young man to find if he will be 
                         soldier in our army.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it 
                         go?

                                     KOREAN DOCTOR
                         I don't liking it at all, what I 
                         hear when I listen to the heart. And 
                         such a blood pressure for so young a 
                         boys. Is frightening.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I'm sorry to hear that. You think 
                         he's unfit for military service?

                                     KOREAN DOCTOR
                         At first is no doubt. But then I am 
                         seeing on his paper he work in 
                         American hospital. And I think there 
                         are so many drugs in such a places, 
                         he could take some by mistake.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Why would he do that?

                                     KOREAN DOCTOR
                         Who is knowing? But the drug I have 
                         find in his urine is solving all 
                         mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone 
                         his fast heart and high blood 
                         pressure. So I think maybe you will 
                         like to tell him goodbye. Okay?

               He gives Hawkeye a warm smile and leaves the two of them 
               alone. It's clear from Hawkeye's expression that he has no 
               choice but to admit defeat.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Sorry, Ho-Jon. I didn't think they'd 
                         be that sharp. But I'm still going 
                         to start the ball rolling for you to 
                         go to college in America when you 
                         get out. My old school, Androscoggin.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. OFFICERS' LATRINE  DAY

               It's a warm spring day in a climate much like the northeastern 
               part of the United States. At first we see nothing but the 
               latrine tent, which is identified by a sign. A couple of 
               small missiles propelled with considerable force strike the 
               canvas, but it is only when they roll back to the ground 
               that we can identify them as golf balls. A closer look at 
               the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered around, 
               and then we see two Korean Houseboys appear from protected 
               places on the sides of the tent, looking carefully to make 
               sure there are no more balls coming, and proceed to gather 
               up those on the ground. During this action there is the SOUND 
               of a helicopter landing near the hospital.

               EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE  DAY

               The disreputability in clothes and grooming that has been 
               increasing with each view of the Swampmen has reached an 
               extreme stage in the view we now get of Hawkeye and Trapper. 
               ALong with their soiled fatigue pants, Hawkeye wears a torn, 
               dirty T-shirt of some unlikely color, Trapper a sport shirt 
               that looks as if he had picked it up in Hawaii on the way 
               over and worn it ever since. Both are unshaven.

               Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces 
               the iron club he has been using for the medium-range shots 
               they have been practicing. Taking out drivers, they set tees 
               in the ground and, as the houseboys run up with the balls, 
               Trapper indicates they will be shooting down the longest 
               dimension of the field. After addressing the balls with a 
               few practice swings, they deliver expert drives that are not 
               only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight in the intended 
               direction.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (pleased with himself)
                         I came within about ten yards of 
                         you. You know something, Trapper, 
                         the way we been going, if we ever 
                         got to see a real golf course again, 
                         I bet we could burn it up.

                                     TRAPPER
                         As far as the greens maybe. I don't 
                         know if my putting would come back 
                         or not, without some practice.

               The SOUND of the helicopter taking off again doesn't concern 
               them till they realize it is headed directly toward them. It 
               comes down so close to them they step back to avoid the wind 
               from the propeller blades, which the PILOT keeps going as he 
               and Vollmer climb out.

                                     VOLLMER
                              (to pilot)
                         That's him on the right.

                                     PILOT
                         That's Captain McIntyre?

                                     VOLLMER
                              (to Trapper)
                         The Lieutenant's flown up from Seoul 
                         just to find you.

                                     PILOT
                         You're Captain McIntyre?

                                     TRAPPER
                         That's what the Army calls me. Stick 
                         out your tongue, take off your shirt 
                         and tell me where it hurts you.

               His face showing his bewilderment, the Pilot silently hands 
               Trapper a long white envelope and a large brown one. Trapper 
               tears open the white one, glances at the top copy of the 
               order it contains.

                                     TRAPPER
                         '...Proceed immediately to Kokura, 
                         Japan...'
                              (to Pilot)
                         Do you know what this is about?

                                     PILOT
                         There's a GI there whose father's a 
                         Congressman. A grenade went off in 
                         training and they think there's a 
                         piece of it in his heart.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (opening brown envelope)
                         These his X-rays?

                                     PILOT
                         Yes, sir. Apparently some big chest 
                         surgeon in Boston told the Congressman 
                         the only man to take care of his son 
                         was Captain John McIntyre.
                              (his doubt undiminished)
                         I suppose there could be more than 
                         one doctor with that name...

               Trapper meanwhile has held the X-rays up to the sunlight and 
               invited Hawkeye to look at them at the same time.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (looking back at 
                              orders; to Hawkeye)
                         General Hammond says I can take anyone 
                         along I need to assist me. Want to 
                         come?

               Hawkeye uses the pretense of scanning the X-rays from another 
               angle to draw Trapper aside, so they can speak without the 
               Pilot and Vollmer hearing them.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I'm not so sure the goddam thing's 
                         in his heart.

                                     TRAPPER
                         'Course it isn't, but how many chances 
                         do we get to go to Japan? With our 
                         golf clubs.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. AIRPORT IN KOKURA, JAPAN  DAY

               It is a bright, sunny afternoon in peaceful Japan. Hawkeye 
               and Trapper, in the same outlandish clothes, walk from the 
               military transport plane in which they have made the trip 
               from Seoul, and approach a car with "25TH STATION HOSPITAL" 
               emblazoned on its side.

               The driver, SERGEANT GORMAN, is asleep. With their golf clubs 
               slung over their shoulders, they get into the back seat. 
               Hawkeye pulls the door closed with the loudest possible BANG, 
               and succeeds in waking Gorman, who turns on them with outraged 
               indignation.

                                     GORMAN
                         Garrada there!

                                     TRAPPER
                         What?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Let me translate. I've had some 
                         exposure to the language. The young 
                         man is from Brooklyn and he wants us 
                         to vacate this vehicle.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Gorman)
                         But weren't you supposed to meet the 
                         surgeons who are going to slice up 
                         the Congressman's son?

                                     GORMAN
                         You guys are the quacks?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You betcher ever-loving A, buddy-
                         boy.

                                     GORMAN
                         Poor kid. Goddam Army.

                                     TRAPPER
                         But besides the operation, we've got 
                         to get in at least eighteen holes of 
                         golf.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         So let's haul ass, Sergeant.

                                     GORMAN
                         Goddam Army.

               But he starts the engine.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ARMY CAR  DAY

               There is silence between Sergeant Gorman and his passengers 
               as the military hospital comes into view. But something else 
               comes into view in the distance at the same time: the 
               unmistakable contours of a golf course.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Look.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Beautiful. What do you think? Should 
                         we stop and play nine holes now and 
                         operate on the kid later? If he's 
                         still alive.

                                     GORMAN
                         Goddam Army.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I think we ought to operate first, 
                         no frills, get through it on the 
                         double. Then we'll be nice and relaxed 
                         on the course.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Good thinking.

                                     GORMAN
                         Goddam, goddam Army.

               They are coming to a stop in front of the hospital.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL  DAY

               A PRETTY WAC sits behind a reception desk doing a job so 
               utterly routine she doesn't even look up from her magazine 
               when Hawkeye puts a question to her.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Where's the Congressman's son at, 
                         honey?

                                     PRETTY WAC
                         Ward Six.

               But then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a 
               full look, and her reaction indicates clearly that she is 
               not prepared for unkempt, unmilitary-looking men carrying 
               golf bags.

                                     PRETTY WAC
                         Hey you can't go in there! Who are 
                         you?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I'm the pro from Dover and this is 
                         my favorite caddie.

                                     PRETTY WAC
                         Well, you can't go in. No till you 
                         tell me your business and I check 
                         with Colonel Merrill's office.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (relenting)
                         Well, if you must know...

               But Trapper has meanwhile made a feint toward the door, to 
               which the Pretty Wac responds by rising and interposing 
               herself in his path.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         Hold it. If this soldier enforces 
                         her own orders. I'm ready to take 
                         her on. Anxious. Single combat.

               He moves toward the girl, who holds her ground staunchly 
               till they are almost in contact. Then she takes a step back, 
               and continues to take one step backwards for each one of his 
               in her direction. When they get close to the door, her 
               resistance collapses entirely and she scurries back to her 
               seat at the desk, where she grabs the phone as Trapper and 
               Hawkeye march through the door.

                                     PRETTY WAC
                              (into phone)
                         Colonel Marril's office.

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL  DAY

               All personnel, American and Japanese (who, like the Koreans 
               at MASH, do the menial work) react in surprise to the sight 
               of Trapper and Hawkeye making their way around a few corners 
               till they find Ward Six.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. WARD SIX  DAY

               Two golf bags are propped against the foot of the 
               Congressman's son's bed. Trapper listens closely to the boy's 
               chest while Hawkeye bends down to his ear to reassure him. A 
               WARD NURSE hovers near him, not actually cooperating with 
               them but not defying them either.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Congressman's son)
                         Don't worry, son. That's Captain 
                         McIntyre, and he's the best chest 
                         surgeon in the Far East and maybe in 
                         the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you 
                         up fine. Your daddy saw to that.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Just like we thought, it's a routine 
                         problem. Nurse, who's in charge of 
                         operating room preparations?

               By the time he has begun his question to her, the WARD NURSE 
               has spotted someone approaching of whom she is in obvious 
               dread. And it is at this figure that she points by way of 
               answer: a firece looking NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN.

                                     WARD NURSE
                         Sh-sh-she is.

               Anticipating that a major confrontation is about to take 
               place, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to keep it away from their 
               patient's beside. Accordingly they pick up their golf bags 
               and go to meet the advancing Captain.

                                     NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
                         What are you hoodlums doing in this 
                         hospital?

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (politely)
                         We're surgeons, ma'am, we're here to 
                         work. All we want is our starting 
                         time.

                                     NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
                         You can't even look at a patient 
                         here till Colonel Merrill says it's 
                         okay. And he's still out for lunch.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (quietly)
                         Look, Mother. I want to go to work 
                         in one hour. We're the pros from 
                         Dover and we figure to crack that 
                         kid's chest and get out to the golf 
                         course before it's dark. So find the 
                         gas-passer and tell him to premedicate 
                         the patient. Then bring me the latest 
                         pictures on him; the ones we saw 
                         must be forty-eight hours old by 
                         now. And tell the kitchen to rustle 
                         up some lunch. Ham and eggs'll do; 
                         steak would be even better. And give 
                         me at least one nurse who knows how 
                         to work in close without getting her 
                         tits in my way.
                              (as she hesitates)
                         You're going to have to move quicker 
                         than that. I said an hour.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               CAPTAIN E.B. (ME LAY) MARSTON is the anesthesiologist at the 
               25th.

               Wearing gown, cap, and mask, he is busily at work checking 
               the Congressman's son to make sure he is properly 
               anesthetized. At that moment the doors open and in come 
               Trapper and Hawkeye, also wearing OR outfits, as are the two 
               nurses who stand by waiting for them. Trapper looks 
               questioningly at Me Lay, who answers with a nod that all is 
               ready.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               The atmosphere in the OR is tense. Hawkeye is maintaining 
               proper traction on the clamp that holds the lung in place, 
               while Trapper concentrates on removing the fragment.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Got it.

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         I demand an explanation!

               COLONEL MERRILL, Commanding Officer of the hospital, has 
               stormed through the OR swinging doors in full military uniform 
               without any antiseptic precautions.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to circulating nurse)
                         Get that dirty old man out of the 
                         operating room!

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         I'm Colonel Merrill!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Beat it, Pop. If this chest gets 
                         infected, I'll tell the Congressman 
                         who did it.

               To everyone's astonishment, including the Colonel's, it works. 
               He turns around and walks out without another word. Most 
               affected of all by Hawkeye's audacity is Me Lay, who reacts 
               with a sharp look in Hawkeye's direction and then by picking 
               up his anesthesia chart and writing, in the space labeled 
               "First Assistant," the name "Hawkeye Pierce."

                                     TRAPPER
                         Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.

                                     ME LAY
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         May I have the surgeon's name, please?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He's the pro from Dover and I'm the 
                         Ghost of Smokey Joe.

                                     ME LAY
                         Save that crap for the rest of the 
                         clamdiggers back home.

               Both surgeons stop working in their surprise. Hawkeye looks 
               at the anesthesia chart and sees where Me Lay has written 
               his name. Then he takes a closer look at Me Lay himself, or 
               what shows of him between his cap and his mask.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Trapper)
                         Did I ever tell you about Me Lay 
                         Marston?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Your high school friend who went 
                         around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to 
                         all the young females in the 
                         community. As I remember, you said 
                         it was quite a successful approach.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Well, he wouldn't score more than 
                         once in seven or eight tries, but 
                         the important thing was he didn't 
                         waste time socializing. Anyway, 
                         Trapper John, this is Me Lay.

                                     ME LAY
                         The real Trapper John? The one who 
                         threw you the famous pass and went 
                         to greater glory on the Boston and 
                         Maine Railroad?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         The one and only.

                                     ME LAY
                         Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to 
                         shake your hand if you'll hurry up 
                         and get that chest closed.
                              (looks around to make 
                              sure the nurses can't 
                              hear)
                         You still working the trains?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Planes mostly. May take a crack at 
                         rickshaws. How does the direct 
                         approach work over here?

                                     ME LAY
                         I been out of action since I got 
                         over here five months ago.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You don't go after the local scrunch?

                                     ME LAY
                         I'm too busy, actually. Not for the 
                         Army, of course, but where I live. 
                         Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric 
                         Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. 
                         The guy has this crude hospital for 
                         kids and a whorehouse on the side to 
                         finance it, all in the same building.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. SURGEONS' DRESSING ROOM, 25TH STATION HOSPITAL  DAY

               Hawkeye and Trapper have washed and put their golf practice 
               clothes back on. Me Lay is dressed in fresh fatigues with 
               Captain's bars.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Me Lay)
                         What do you do in the joint besides 
                         pimp?

                                     ME LAY
                         That's about the only thing I don't 
                         do  that I'm built for. I inspect 
                         the girls and take care of some of 
                         the kids in the hospital. Sometimes 
                         I tend bar and act as bouncer.

               A CORPORAL enters with the manner of a messenger from on 
               high.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Captain Pierce? Captain McIntyre? 
                         Colonel Merrill wishes you to report 
                         to his office immediately.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Tell him we'll think about it.
                              (to Trapper)
                         I suppose we do have to reach some 
                         sort of understanding with the old 
                         boy.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Me Lay)
                         What's the bastard really like?

                                     ME LAY
                              (for the Corporal's 
                              benefit as well as 
                              theirs)
                         Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty-
                         five years in the Regular Army, a 
                         soldier first and a doctor second. A 
                         member of several patriotic 
                         organizations, he believes it's 
                         America's God-given mission to 
                         maintain a foothold for freedom on 
                         the Asian mainland.

                                     TRAPPER
                         That bad?
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         But I guess you're right. We might 
                         as well see him.
                              (reaches for golf 
                              bag, to Corporal)
                         Got any caddie carts?

                                     CORPORAL
                         What?

               Trapper just slings his golf bag over his shoulder with a 
               sigh, as does Hawkeye. Me Lay, meanwhile, has written a few 
               words on a scrap of paper.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Corporal)
                         Never mind.

                                     ME LAY
                              (hands paper to Hawkeye)
                         The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. 
                         Why don't you meet me there when 
                         you're through golf for drinks and 
                         dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Mine's already been struck, and it 
                         doesn't have to be very fancy.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Corporal)
                         Lead the way.

               The Corporal does so and they follow him out.

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL  DAY

               Hawkeye and Trapper come out of the dressing room after the 
               Corporal and follow him down a corridor. Then they realize 
               to their surprise that there are two other soldiers following 
               them who have been stationed outside the dressing door. Their 
               invitation from the Colonel is getting to seem less casual 
               every moment.

               INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OUTER OFFICE  DAY

               A SECOND LIEUTENANT and a Sergeant seated on opposite sides 
               of a desk look up with interest as Trapper and Hawkeye come 
               in with escorts fore and aft.

                                     SECOND LIEUTENANT
                         These the prisoners?

                                     CORPORAL
                         Yes, sir.

               Hawkeye and Trapper exchange looks.

                                     SECOND LIEUTENANT
                         They can wait in the Colonel's office. 
                         He'll be back in a few minutes.

               The Corporal opens the door to the Colonel's empty and quite 
               luxurious office. Trapper and Hawkeye go in with their golf 
               bags.

               INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OFFICE  DAY

               Trapper and Hawkeye enter, the door closing behind them, and 
               look around. It is a long time since they have seen 
               surroundings like these, with Western upholstered furniture, 
               pictures on the walls and high quality wall-to-wall carpeting. 
               It is this last feature that attracts Hawkeye's attention. 
               He squats down to feel its texture and with a look invites 
               Trapper to do the same. Trapper is also impressed with the 
               smoothness of the surface, and without having to exchange a 
               word about it, they each find a putter and a golf ball and 
               start lining up targets for their brief sorely missed putting 
               practice.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OFFICE  DAY

               The Colonel comes in militarily, which is the way he makes 
               all his entrances.

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         You men are under arrest!

                                     TRAPPER
                         Quiet! Can't you see I'm putting?

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         I'll have you...!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Please!
                              (completes a putt, 
                              walks over and picks 
                              up ball)
                         Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, 
                         we have you. Your boys blew this 
                         case, we bailed you out. We figure 
                         we ought to hang around a day to 
                         check the Congressman's kid, and we 
                         also figure to play some golf. So if 
                         that's okay with you, we got a deal.

                                     TRAPPER
                         And if it isn't, why don't we call 
                         Washington on your telephone? You 
                         tell your story, we'll tell ours.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (picking up his clubs)
                         When you make up your mind, get in 
                         touch. The golf club is probably the 
                         best place to leave a message.

               Trapper has also taken his golf bag, and the two of them 
               walk out serenely together. The Colonel supports himself on 
               his desk as he makes his way to his chair and sits down to 
               absorb the shock to his system.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. JAPANESE GOLF CLUB PRO SHOP  LATE AFTERNOON

               The shop features an assortment of Western style golfing 
               attire, all about two decades behind the times. Trapper is 
               holding a pair of 'plus fours' in front of him to test the 
               size. The GOLF PRO looks on with the studied approval of the 
               dedicated salesman everywhere; Hawkeye with amusement.

                                     TRAPPER
                         These the longest you've got?

                                     GOLF PRO
                         Wonderful. They are looking like 
                         they are made for you.

               Hawkeye has discovered a pair of knee-length argyle socks, 
               which he exhibits to Trapper.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We got to have these to wear with 
                         them.
                              (glances out window)
                         You know, by the time we get all 
                         this stuff on, it'll be practically 
                         dark.

               Two GIRL CADDIES enter the shop while he is speaking. They 
               are very young, not more than seventeen, dressed in slacks. 
               They see Trapper and Hawkeye's golf bags and start to sling 
               them over their shoulders.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (agreeing)
                         Yeah, maybe we ought to...
                              (sees caddies)
                         Hey, who are they?

                                     GOLF PRO
                         Your caddies. But perhaps it is 
                         becoming too late to start.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (walking over to 
                              caddies for closer 
                              look)
                         Not at all.
                              (touches the prettier 
                              one under the chin 
                              to raise her downcast 
                              head)
                         What's your name, honey?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Come on, Trapper. We got to forget 
                         golf for today.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I don't know why. As long as it's 
                         light enough to see your caddie.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Golf Pro)
                         What's the age of consent in this 
                         country?

                                     GOLF PRO
                         Which? I do not know what you mean.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Never mind.
                              (to Trapper)
                         Let's take one sport at a time. The 
                         place for tonight's is the New Era 
                         Pediatric Hospital Et Cetera.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. & W.  DINING ROOM  NIGHT

               Trapper and Hawkeye, dressed in kimonos, are sitting Japanese 
               style on the floor with Me Lay around a low table. Three 
               girls serve them attentively, doing everything for them except 
               actually feeding them.

               A girl named MICHIKO takes away a plate that Trapper has 
               left virtually untouched and puts a bowl of thick soup in 
               front of him.

               The second girl serves soup to Hawkeye and Me Lay, and the 
               third brings in a large bowl of rice.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Soup? Rice? What are we doing, 
                         beginning all over again?

                                     ME LAY
                         No, we had a clear soup to start. 
                         This is a thick one and you ought to 
                         taste it. There's nothing like it 
                         back home.

                                     TRAPPER
                         How can I taste it now? We've already 
                         had like twelve courses.

                                     MICHIKO
                         You are not wishing to eat more? I 
                         bring you most special plum brandy.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I don't want it. I don't want to 
                         eat, I don't want to drink.
                              (reaches out and grabs 
                              Michiko's ankle)
                         All I want...

               There is a KNOCK on the door, followed immediately by the 
               entrance of a Japanese nurse, who indicates an urgent desire 
               to speak to Me Lay. Me Lay gets up and listens to what she 
               tells him in an undertone. Trapper meanwhile has succeeded 
               in pulling Michiko off her feet, and makes clear the general 
               direction of his intentions by sprawling out on the floor 
               with her in his embrace.

                                     ME LAY
                              (to Hawkeye and Trapper)
                         Can you guys take one minute to look 
                         at a kid for me?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Now?

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Me Lay)
                         Why can't you look at him?

                                     ME LAY
                         I have but well, you know, I've been 
                         mainly an anesthetist a long time 
                         now and... well, I'd like you guys 
                         to take a look at him.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What's the story?

                                     ME LAY
                         Well, one of the girls got careless 
                         and two days ago she gave birth to 
                         an eight-pound American-Japanese 
                         male.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What's wrong with him?

                                     ME LAY
                         Every time we feed him, it either 
                         comes right back up or he coughs and 
                         turns blue and has a hell of a time.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (releasing Michiko 
                              and sitting up 
                              reluctantly)
                         We don't have to see him. Call that 
                         halfassed Army hospital and tell 
                         them to be ready to put some lipiodol 
                         in this kid's esophagus and take X-
                         rays.

                                     ME LAY
                         But it's ten-thirty at night. We 
                         can't get military personnel out for 
                         a civilian. A foreign civilian.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Don't give them any unnecessary 
                         details. Just say the pros from Dover 
                         are on their way with an emergency. 
                         And you'd better get the OR cranked 
                         up because I got a feeling you're 
                         going to pass some gas while I help 
                         Trapper close a little bastard's 
                         tracheo-esophageal fistula.

               INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Three OR nurses are at work getting things on order when the 
               swinging doors open and Me Lay, carrying the two-day-old 
               baby, enters, accompanied by Hawkeye and Trapper. Nothing 
               has led the nurses to expect an infant patient, and they are 
               distinctly taken aback.

                                     FIRST OR NURSE
                         Where did that baby come from? Is 
                         that what you got us up for?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Yes, ladies, that's why we got you 
                         up. Me Lay, put him down there...
                              (indicating operating 
                              table)
                         ...and get ready to start giving him 
                         the anesthetic.
                              (to nurses)
                         We stumbled on this deal. We didn't 
                         want it but we don't see how we can 
                         walk away from it, no matter whose 
                         rules are broken. This baby has no 
                         legal right to be taken care of in 
                         an Army hospital, though his father 
                         was probably an American soldier. 
                         But he's going to die if we don't 
                         fix him now, tonight. So what about 
                         it?

                                     FIRST OR NURSE
                         Let's get going.

               Me Lay places the mask attached to his gas container on the 
               baby's face ans starts to administer a carefully limited 
               quantity.

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         This time I will not be intimidated!

               He has come into the OR while he is talking, and he is so 
               menacing that all preparations are halted while he finishes 
               his pronouncement.

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         I command that this improper and 
                         illegal use of Army facilities cease 
                         immediately. Twice you men have forced 
                         me into appeasing your aggression by 
                         threatening me with what you'll say 
                         to a certain Congressman. Well, I 
                         don't care what you tell him or anyone 
                         else! I don't care if it costs me my 
                         command and my whole career in the 
                         Army. On this point I stand as a 
                         matter of principle, as unshakable 
                         as the Rock of Gibraltar.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Me Lay? Trapper?

               Moving in concert, Hawkeye and Trapper grab Colonel Merrill 
               and drag him over to Me Lay's end of the operating table. Me 
               Lay takes the anesthetic mask from the baby's face and clamps 
               it firmly on the Colonel's. The Colonel struggles for a while 
               but they manage to hold him and pretty soon he is quiet.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Is he out?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Like the Rock of Gibraltar.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. & W.  HALLWAY  NIGHT

               Trapper, Hawkeye and Me Lay are half-dragging, half-carrying 
               Colonel Merrill along a corridor, and girls, including Michiko 
               and the others we have seen before, have come out of their 
               rooms to watch.

                                     ME LAY
                         He's coming to.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Let's get his clothes off quick.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DR. N.E.P.H. & W.  BEDROOM  NIGHT

               Colonel Merrill is stirring on the bed as Hawkeye and Me Lay 
               remove the last item of his clothing. The Colonel opens his 
               eyes but he is still too drugged to have any idea where he 
               is or how he got there.

                                     ME LAY
                         Okay, Michiko.

               Michiko moves toward the bed, removing the kimono which is 
               her only garment. At the same time Hawkeye grabs a camera, 
               which is all ready for use with a flashbulb attachment and 
               starts to take a series of shots of the Colonel and Michiko, 
               both naked in the bed. The Colonel reacts to the intermittent 
               bursts of light.

                                     COLONEL MERRILL
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     MICHIKO
                         Please, you no worry, sweetheart. 
                         Just keeping close.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (after five or six 
                              shots)
                         All right, that's plenty. You can 
                         put your clothes on, Colonel.

               Michiko reaches for her kimono and puts it back on as she 
               gets out of bed. The Colonel sits up, still a bit dazed but 
               becoming more aware of what's happening all the time.

                                     COLONEL MERILL
                         I've been framed!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         That's what they all say. But I have 
                         photographic evidence here that you're 
                         a lecherous old man and a disgrace 
                         to the uniform. However, I won't 
                         even develop the film if your people 
                         watch that baby we operated on like 
                         he was the Congressman's grandson. 
                         Which for all we know he may be.

               INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. & W.  HALLWAY  NIGHT

               Michiko joins Me Lay.

                                     MICHIKO
                         Where is Captain McIntyre? I am 
                         waiting so long for him.

               Me Lay open a bedroom door, revealing Trapper fully dressed 
               and sound asleep on the bed.

                                     ME LAY
                         Give him a few hours, Michiko. Right 
                         now he couldn't get up a flight of 
                         stairs.

               Michiko's answering smile indicates superior feminine wisdom 
               in these matters. She goes into the room, closing the door 
               behind her.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. WARD SIX. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL  DAY

               Hawkeye, dressed in the Japanese adaptation of the well-
               dressed American golfer of the 1930's, and carrying his golf 
               bag, is at the Congressman's son's bedside. He looks at the 
               boy's chart and then at the patient himself, finding both of 
               them quite satisfactory.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM  DAY

               Trapper, similarly outfitted with individual variations of 
               his own, has just examined the baby they operated on. He 
               writes out some instructions and gives them to a nurse. Then 
               he picks up his golf bag and goes out to a corridor where 
               Hawkeye is waiting for him.

               They start to walk toward the hospital entrance, finally 
               ready for a few hours of relaxation on the golf course.

                                     VOICE
                              (over loudspeaker 
                              system)
                         Captain Pierce and Captain McIntyre! 
                         Please contact the message center. 
                         Captain Pierce and Captain McIntyre!

               They look at each other with foreboding.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It couldn't be good news.

               By joint unspoken agreement, they quicken their pace in the 
               same direction. Then their resolution falters.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to a passing nurse)
                         Where's the goddam message center?

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. 4077TH MASH  LATE AFTERNOON

               OR facilities are being utilized to capacity. For the first 
               time we see Henry himself in surgeon's working dress, winding 
               up an operation. Completing his work, looking tired and 
               anxious, he walks through the crowded OR to the Preop Ward, 
               which is also jammed up with cases awaiting surgery. Leslie 
               comes to meet him.

                                     HENRY
                         What's the lineup, Major?

                                     LESLIE
                         Six cases ready for surgery, sir, 
                         and four more that just need a little 
                         more blood or a little more time for 
                         the antibiotics to take hold.

                                     HENRY
                         I guess we can handle them, if there 
                         aren't any six o'clock choppers. 
                         Every time they fly while it's still 
                         daylight, they've got wounded that 
                         can't wait.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  LATE AFTERNOON

               Henry's watch says a minute or two after six o'clock. Once 
               more, as at the beginning, he is standing outside the 
               Admitting Ward with Radar, listening for helicopters coming 
               from the north. Radar, straining his superhearing to listen, 
               reacts unhappily to a sound neither we nor Henry can catch.

                                     RADAR
                         Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of 
                         them, I'm afraid.

                                     HENRY
                         Damn.

                                     RADAR
                              (a puzzled look)
                         And another one, but it's from the 
                         south.
                              (looking south)
                         There.

               Henry looks eagerly to the south as the COMBINED SOUND of 
               three helicopters becomes audible and quickly mounts in 
               intensity.

               EXT. SKY TO THE SOUTH  DAY

               A helicopter (the type that came from Seoul to pick up Trapper 
               and Hawkeye, rather than the Air Rescue Squadron ones that 
               bring the wounded from the front) approaches the landing 
               area and starts to make its descent. There is a golf bag 
               full of clubs attached to each of its pods.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY

               Trapper and Hawkeye, conspicuous because they are still in 
               their golf costumes, are among the surgeons checking the 
               newly arrived wounded. More cases are still being brought in 
               from helicopters and ambulances, mainly on stretchers, a few 
               under their own power assisted by a Medical Corpsman or two. 
               This is really the most hideous face of war; the mangled 
               bodies and limbs and faces, the expressions alive with pain 
               and dulled by shock, are more terrible than any number of 
               quiescent corpses. Trapper finishes examining a man and speaks 
               to Hot Lips.

                                     TRAPPER
                         This one goes right to the OR. Tell 
                         Duke to do him ahead of the busted 
                         spleen.
                              (moving on to another 
                              patient, a Korean)
                         And this kid can't wait. I'll take 
                         him myself, before I get to that 
                         ruptured diaphragm.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Captain...
                              (securing his attention)
                         'This kid' is a prisoner of war.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Yeah?

                                     HOT LIPS
                         It's an American boy's rupture you're 
                         supposed to close.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Listen, we get a deluge like this, 
                         just deciding priorities on a medical 
                         basis is hard enough. So never mind 
                         the side issues.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               A few days later. Duke is working deep inside a belly with a 
               new young surgeon, CAPTAIN LAPHAM, assisting him. Lapham 
               glances at the patient's face.

                                     LAPHAM
                         Duke...

               Duke looks, too, and the patient's eyes are enough to tell 
               him the job he's doing no longer has any function. After an 
               almost superfluous check of the heartbeat, Lapham closes the 
               man's eyes.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye, with Ugly John handling the anesthetic, is digging 
               out pieces of metal from a face that will never quite look 
               like a face again.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Trapper, with Painless filling in as anesthesioloigist, is 
               working in close to a patient's heart. Suddenly all the lights 
               in the OR go out. This is not an unprecedented event, and 
               one by one three corpsmen appear in different locations around 
               the operating table with flashlights whose combined beams 
               make it possible for Trapper to carry on.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               With the electric light restored, Duke and Lapham are at 
               work on another case, removing several feet of small bowel 
               no longer useful to the owner.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Henry and Murrhardt, with Scorch assisting, are amputating 
               an arm.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               A dead patient, face covered with a sheet is removed from an 
               operating table by two corpsmen. Immediately two other 
               corpsmen bring a stretcher to the other side of the table 
               and unload a new patient onto it. Ugly John and a nurse start 
               to prepare him for surgery.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye, with Knocko helping, is sewing up an incision which 
               we can see is in the area of the groin. Dago Red comes by.

                                     DAGO RED
                         Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He'll live if that's what you mean. 
                         But somebody better be around when 
                         he comes to and finds out there's 
                         nothing left between his legs.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY

               A few days later. A new group of patients is being brought 
               in on stretchers by corpsmen. Trapper and Duke are examining 
               an unconscious Negro private. Trapper looks at him with 
               special attention to the eyes. The right pupil is dilated 
               and fixed. Duke meanwhile checks his pulse and blood pressure.

                                     DUKE
                         Pulse, slow, very little pressure.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Look at that right eye.

                                     DUKE
                         Epidural hematoma?

                                     TRAPPER
                         I don't know what else. You've been 
                         that route a little, haven't you?

                                     DUKE
                         Not enough to be a pro.

               He moves to another case. Duke continues to examine the 
               private with particular attention to the right side of the 
               head. The more he observes, the more alarmed he becomes.

                                     DUKE
                              (to corpsman)
                         Into the OR! Right now.

               He runs ahead of the stretcher through the Preop Ward. At 
               the entrance to the OR he runs into Knocko.

                                     DUKE
                         Quick, Knocko, get me gloves, knife, 
                         hammer, chisel, Gelfoam and a drain.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               Knocko finishes saving and cleaning the right temporal area 
               of the unconscious private's head, and Duke wastes no time 
               making an incision down to the bone.

                                     DUKE
                         Okay, give me the hammer and chisel. 
                         There are drills you can make nice, 
                         neat holes in the skull with, but we 
                         ain't got none.
                              (taking hammer and 
                              chisel, fortifying 
                              himself for the act)
                         So here goes.

               He pounds the chisel into the private's skull and keeps at 
               it till he cracks his way through. Blood flows out in a 
               torrent. Duke pulls his tools away and just watches. Very 
               quickly he is rewarded by the sight of a torrent diminishing 
               to a dribble.

                                     KNOCKO
                         What happens now?

                                     DUKE
                         We sew him up.

               He stuffs Gelfoam down into the bleeding site, puts in a 
               rubber drain and starts to sew the skin back together with 
               silk sutures.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               The private is moaning and stirring restlessly on the table 
               as Duke finishes closing the incision and Knocko takes the 
               Patient's pulse.

                                     KNOCKO
                         Pulse is way back. Nearly sixty.

                                     DUKE
                         We took the pressure off his brain. 
                         You know, Knocko, this boy might 
                         just make it, and if he does you and 
                         me ought to be ready with a story.

                                     KNOCKO
                         What do you mean?

                                     DUKE
                         One thing everybody knows for sure 
                         that don't know hardly anything else, 
                         is how delicate any kind of brain 
                         surgery is. So I certainly wouldn't 
                         like it if there was somebody going 
                         around saying all I did was crack 
                         him on the head with a hammer and 
                         chisel.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ADMITTING WARD  DAY

               Hawkeye is examining a young PRIVATE FIRST CLASS who is in 
               shock, semiconscious and saturated with mud over his whole 
               uniform, hair and skin. There is a muddy, bloody bandage 
               around his neck.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to a corpsman)
                         Get that bandage off so I can see 
                         what the hell's underneath.

               He moves on to the next stretcher. The corpsman undoes the 
               bandage and pulls it away. The Private First Class turns his 
               head to the left, and blood spurts two feet into the air 
               from a hole in the right side of his neck.

                                     PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
                         Mama, Mama! Oh, Mama, I'm dying!

               The blood continues to gush as the people in the immediate 
               vicinity watch in fascination. As it comes down again if 
               falls on the PFC's face and into his mouth. He reacts by 
               coughing, spraying his audience with blood. Hawkeye runs 
               back and sticks his index finger down the hole, blocking off 
               the severed artery and stopping the flow of blood.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to corpsmen)
                         Bring him to the OR right on this 
                         stretcher. I can't take my finger 
                         out. Somebody find Ugly John and get 
                         his ass in there.

               They are already in motion toward OR, Hawkeye moving along 
               beside the stretcher with his finger in the hole. On the way 
               they pass near Leslie.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         This one is urgent, Les. Start 
                         somebody cutting off his clothes. 
                         Tell the lab to come in with a couple 
                         of pints of low titre O, and type 
                         and cross-match him for five or six 
                         more. Get somebody to do two 
                         countdowns and start the blood. Come 
                         to think of it, get somebody to start 
                         rounding up donors, and send some 
                         cowboys to Seoul for all the goddam 
                         blood they can get. And get that 
                         miserable gas-passer in here!

                                     UGLY JOHN
                              (at OR entrance)
                         I'm here.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Good. Get him asleep and a tube in 
                         him if you can. His common carotid 
                         is cut and I can't do anything with 
                         the son-of-a-bitch jumping all over 
                         the place.
                              (to Leslie)
                         Find somebody to help me. I got to 
                         keep a finger on this or we lose 
                         him, and I can't get it clamped with 
                         my left hand.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  DAY

               The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without 
               Hawkeye losing his finger pressure on the artery. The clothes 
               have been cut off him, and Ugly John has both blood and 
               anesthetic going into him, the latter through an intratracheal 
               tube. Hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he 
               enlarges the wound around his right index finger. Then he 
               tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger into the wound 
               to clamp the artery but he can't manage it lefthanded.

               He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every 
               surgeon and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot 
               Lips. Ugly John is having a hard time fulfilling his dual 
               function as it is, and can't possibly take on another. Hawkeye 
               tried again with the clamp and fails, and then, to his great 
               relief, there appears within in his peripheral vision as he 
               concentrates his attention on the PFC's neck, a male figure, 
               gowned, capped, masked and gloved. It doesn't matter to 
               Hawkeye which of his colleagues it is; he just tells him 
               what assistance he needs from him.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Grab this Kelly, ride it down my 
                         fingers and we'll have this mother 
                         under control.

               The newcomer, though Hawkeye doesn't realize it, is Dago 
               Red.

               Following instructions, he takes the clamp and inserts it in 
               the wound.

                                     DAGO RED
                         What do I do with it Hawk? This is a 
                         little out of my line.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Didn't recognize you, Red. When you 
                         get the clamp all the way down, open 
                         it as wide as you can and see if you 
                         can close it on the artery.

               Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously. When he widens the 
               clamp and starts to close it again, he has the satisfying 
               sensation of feeling something substantial, and seizes it 
               vigorously.

                                     DAGO RED
                         I got it! I got it!

               But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeye's finger 
               and Hawkeye, by reflex action, pulls it out to where we can 
               see it with the clamp grasping it. The blood starts to spurt 
               again and Hawkeye goes back into the wound, but this time 
               with his left index finger.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You got my finger for Christ's sake. 
                         But maybe I can do better with my 
                         right hand.
                              (inserts a retractor 
                              into wound, puts the 
                              working end of it in 
                              Dago Red's hands, 
                              taking back the Kelly 
                              clamp)
                         Pull it toward you. More. Good.
                              (rides clamp down his 
                              left index finger 
                              and this time he 
                              closes it on the 
                              right place)
                         There. That does it for now.
                              (to Ugly John)
                         We'll keep him right where he is 
                         till Trapper John can give me a hand 
                         sewing that artery back together.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  LATE AFTERNOON

               Two helicopters descend to the ground, and corpsmen start 
               unloading the wounded. Also visible are a couple of ambulances 
               that are being unloaded. Henry and the three Swampmen have 
               stepped outside the Admitting Ward entrance to watch. They 
               are all haggard, unshaven and groggy, but Henry, the oldest, 
               is the one who shows the strain the most.

                                     HENRY
                         Fifteenth straight day there've been 
                         six o'clock choppers. How long can a 
                         battle go on?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You got to relax, Henry. Since the 
                         deluge started, you been working in 
                         the OR and running the outfit, too.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Best thing you could do for all of 
                         us is grab some sack time.

                         Radar!

               Radar appears as usual on the instant.

                                     RADAR
                         Yes, sir? I've been trying to persuade 
                         the Colonel to take some rest.

                                     DUKE
                         Well, stop persuading, just make 
                         him.

                                     RADAR
                              (to Duke)
                         Yes, sir.
                              (to Henry)
                         Come along, sir.

               Henry is so fatigued he allows himself to be led away by 
               Radar.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Believe me, Henry, outside of us, no 
                         one'll even know you're gone.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. PREOP WARD  DAY

               Here the more seriously wounded of those brought into the 
               Admitting Ward are getting transfusions, have had Foley 
               catheters inserted in their bladders and/or Levin tubes in 
               their stomachs, and have their X-rays on display on wires in 
               front of each cot. Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke are checking 
               them to establish priorities. They reach the last cot, on 
               which Ho-Jon is lying, attended by a Corpsman we haven't 
               seen before.

                                     CORPSMAN
                         This kid is pretty bad.

               Out of habit Hawkeye looks at the X-ray first.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         For you, Trapper.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (looking at X-ray)
                         Okay, but I'll need you to help. 
                         Duke, will you take that belly back 
                         there? The Australian?

               Duke turns back to undertake his assignment. Trapper and 
               Hawkeye continue to study the X-ray.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It's in pretty deep.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. 
                         I'm afraid it's hit more that just 
                         the lung.

               Ho-Jon opens his eyes and smiles at the sight of his old 
               friends.

                                     CORPSMAN
                              (to Ho-Jon)
                         You'll be okay, boy.

                                     HO-JON
                         I know. I got the best there is. 
                         Captain Pierce and Captain...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Christ, it's Ho-Jon!

                                     TRAPPER
                         Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a 
                         shell in your chest, but we'll take 
                         it out as soon as you've had more 
                         blood. Hey, Radar!

               Radar, passing through the ward, comes over in response to 
               the summons.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Radar)
                         Has that A-negative come from Seoul? 
                         We'll need some in the OR.

                                     RADAR
                         There isn't any. We keep ordering 
                         and they don't deliver.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We got to have at least one pint. 
                         It's for Ho-Jon.

               Radar reacts in surprise and looks toward Ho-Jon's cot.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye is assisting Trapper in making the incision in Ho-
               Jon's right chest. Ugly John is giving the boy additional 
               anesthetic.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         If we squeeze him through, I'm going 
                         to get him into Androscoggin College.

                                     TRAPPER
                         How about squeezing him through into 
                         Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is 
                         catch lobsters, he can learn that 
                         here.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. 
                         If he's as good as I think he is, he 
                         can move into the big league later. 
                         But Androscoggin first.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (studying the incision)
                         We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Never mind the conversation. Do it, 
                         Dad.

                                     TRAPPER
                         You aspirate the blood from the chest 
                         cavity. Damn, there's more of it 
                         than I thought.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (preparing to use 
                              suction device)
                         If we don't get that pint, he's in 
                         trouble.

               EXT. AND INT. HENRY'S TENT  NIGHT

               Radar, followed by an associate lab technician, enters Henry's 
               tent.

               Henry is snoring away in deep sleep. Gently Radar straightens 
               Henry's right arm and deftly injects Novocaine over a vein. 
               Henry stirs.

                                     HENRY
                              (mumbling in sleep)
                         Not now, honey. Gobacksleep.

               The lab technician tightens the sleeve of Henry's T-shirt to 
               serve as a tourniquet, and Radar expertly inserts a needle 
               into the vein and starts extracting blood into a pint 
               container.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye has finished aspirating the blood. Trapper reaches 
               down into the wound.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (triumphantly)
                         I got it. Here, feel. In the cava.

               He takes his hand out and lets Hawkeye put his in.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I don't feel anything.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Oh, Jesus.

               He indicates that he wants to feel again. Hawkeye withdraws 
               his hand and Trapper puts his back in again.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I can't feel it now either. The mother 
                         must have gone in.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I don't get it.

                                     TRAPPER
                         It was in the cava and the hole sealed 
                         itself off. I must have jiggled it 
                         just enough to turn it loose. I can't 
                         feel it in the heart or the right 
                         pulmonary artery. So it's in the 
                         left pulmonary artery.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What do we do?

                                     TRAPPER
                         We'll have to close this hole and 
                         make one on the other side.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Be kind of rough on him if there's 
                         no blood. Why don't we close up and 
                         sit on him a couple of days?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Sure, that's the right way... at 
                         John Hopkins or someplace. But how 
                         do we know there won't be even more 
                         of a jam-up a few days from now? 
                         Maybe we won't be able to get to him 
                         when we want to. Maybe the goddam 
                         thing'll erode the artery when 
                         nobody's looking. Our best shot is 
                         now.

               Radar comes up to the operating table with a container of 
               blood.

                                     RADAR
                         A-negative. I've cross-matched it.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I though you said we didn't have a 
                         drop.

                                     RADAR
                         I found a doner.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Trapper has exposed Ho-Jon's left pulmonary artery. Duke and 
               Hawkeye are assisting him by applying traction to the tapes 
               on either side of where Trapper is now cutting the artery, 
               so that there is only a small flow of blood from the incision. 
               Trapper brings out his hand and displays the tiny metal 
               fragment which is the object of their efforts.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Ugly John)
                         How is he?

                                     UGLY JOHN
                         Nice.

                         Arterial silk.

               He starts to sew the artery back together.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM

               The artery is joined again.

                              (to Hawkeye and Duke)
                         Ease off on those tapes, and let's 
                         see how much it bleeds.
                              (sees a few drops of 
                              blood come through

               INT. HENRY'S OFFICE  DAY

               Henry is on the phone. Hawkeye, Duke, Painless and Radar 
               wait eagerly for the news.

                                     HENRY
                              (into phone)
                         Colonel Blake here.

               INT. GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE, 325 EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               HAMMOND, a one-star general, has a major and a lieutenant 
               colonel with him as he talks to Henry.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                              (into phone)
                         I got news for you, Henry. You've 
                         been so concerned about that battle 
                         for Old Baldy. It's all over.

               INT. HENRY'S OFFICE  DAY

               Henry nods happily to the others to tell them that the word 
               is favorable.

                                     HENRY
                              (into phone)
                         Thanks, General. Thanks for calling.

               He hangs up and turns to the others to pass on the General's 
               exact words.

               INT. GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE, 325 EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               The General wasn't through talking and didn't expect Henry 
               to hang up at that point. He is quite startled, in fact, 
               because he has been saving the most important piece of 
               information for the end.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND

                              lieutenant colonel)
                         He didn't wait to hear who won.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. FIELD NEAR RIVERBANK  DAY

               A very hot day in late August. Standing all by itself in an 
               empty field is a sign on which some fairly careful carpentry 
               and lettering work has been expended. It reads: "38TH PARALLEL 
               MEDICAL SOCIETY MEETS HERE SUNDAYS."

               CAMERA PANS to the river, where Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke 
               are lying on their stomachs, naked or nearly so, on air 
               mattresses. The heat from which they seek relief is obviosly 
               intense, and they are pampering themselves further with tall, 
               ice-filled drinks. On the riverbank near them stands one 
               empty cup and one half-full bottle of Pimms No. 1 Cup, and 
               all three surgeons are more noticeably drunk than we have 
               previously seen them.

                                     TRAPPER
                         She had this shiny black hair piled 
                         up on her head, but later on she let 
                         it hang loose and I'll be damned if 
                         it didn't come all the way down to 
                         her ass.

                                     DUKE
                         I've always had a hankering for blonde 
                         pussy myself. My wife's hair is a 
                         wonderful golden yellow, and this 
                         time of year it gets even lighter.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I guess that's why you go for Hot 
                         Lips Houlihan.

                                     DUKE
                         You know damn well I nearly puke 
                         when I look at her. I don't even 
                         think she's a real blonde.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         How can you say a thing like that 
                         about an officer in the United States 
                         Army?

                                     DUKE
                         I not only say it, I'll back it up 
                         twenty buck's worth.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.
                              (to Trapper)
                         You're a witness.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you 
                         prove who's right?

                                     DUKE
                         There's only one way.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. SHOWER TENT  NIGHT

               Twelve hours later. The shower tent is simply an ordinary 
               Army tent enclosing a row of showers supplied by a water 
               tank on a high platform in back of the tent. Duke and Hawkeye 
               are working under cover of darkness to loosen each of the 
               stakes that secures the tent to the ground around it.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. THE SWAMP  DAY

               The following afternoon. Trapper and Hawkeye sit in chairs 
               outside their tent, glasses in hand, still on their tall, 
               hot-weather drink kick. Trapper looks at his watch.

                                     TRAPPER
                         It's five minutes into nurses' shower 
                         hour. Where are they?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         They're coming.

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  DAY

               The Swamp is at the end of the officers' row nearest the 
               nurses' tents, so they have a good view of the women as they 
               emerge from their quarters dressed in bathrobes and carrying 
               towels, shower caps and bars of soap. The first two to appear 
               are Knocko and Lieutenant Scorch. Next, from her own private 
               tent, comes Hot Lips.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures 
                         you promised to look at of my kids. 
                         You too, Wilma. It won't take a 
                         minute.
                              (to Hot Lips politely)
                         You can see them too, if you want.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         No, thank you. I'm not the slightest 
                         bit interested.

               She continues on across the compound and enters the shower 
               tent.

               Knocko and Lieutenant Scorch come over to the Swamp while 
               Hawkeye goes inside to find the pictures. Then two more nurses 
               emerge from a tent and head for the showers. Trapper gets up 
               and saunters over to intercept them.

               EXT. SHOWER TENT  DAY

               The door of the tent is closed behind Hot Lips, and after a 
               moment there is the sound of water being turned on. Then our 
               attention is drawn to the peak of the tent, to which a thin 
               scarcely visible strand of wire has been attached. The wire 
               is drawn taut and runs across the peak of the barbershop 
               tent next door and down the far side of it to where Duke 
               sits on the ground operating a sort of windlass upon which 
               the wire is wound. He turns the crank with a quick burst of 
               energy.

               Back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas 
               tight, the loosened stakes come out of the ground, and the 
               whole tent is whisked right off its center pole, revealing 
               Hot Lips nude under the shower.

               EXT. BARBERSHOP TENT  DAY

               Duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the 
               crucial view of Hot Lips. The he calls across the compound 
               to Hawkeye.

                                     DUKE
                         Okay, Yankee know-it-all! Pay up!

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. HENRY'S TENT  DAY

               Hot Lips, in her robe, her hair still wet from the shower, 
               carrying her towel and shower cap, is expressing her wrath 
               forcefully to Henry, ignoring the facts that he is in bed 
               and that Leslie is in bed with him, which explains why we 
               have never seen anybody make a pass at her.

                                     HOT LIPS
                         This isn't a hospital, it's an insane 
                         asylum! And it's your fault because 
                         you don't do anything to discourage 
                         them!

                                     HENRY
                         What do you expect me to do?

                                     HOT LIPS
                         Put them under arrest! See what a 
                         courtmartial thinks of their drunken 
                         hooliganism. It started with their 
                         calling me Hot Lips and your letting 
                         them get away with it. You let them 
                         get away with everything! And if you 
                         don't turn them over to the MPs now, 
                         I'm going to resign my commission 
                         and...!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, g-g-goddamit, Hot Lips, resign 
                         your ggodam c-commission!

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH  NIGHT

               Two days later. An Army car bearing the single star of a 
               brigadier general drives up to the entrance. The sergeant at 
               the wheel jumps out and open the rear door for General Hammond 
               and his aide, a captain.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                              (to aide)
                         Tell them I want to talk to all the 
                         officers on the post except those on 
                         emergency duty.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MESS HALL  NIGHT

               Most of the officers of 4077th Mash are assembled to listen 
               to General Hammond. Henry and Hot Lips are both in the front 
               row but separated by some distance and not looking at each 
               other. All the Swampmen are on hand.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         ...These are very serious accusations, 
                         and without prejudging the charges 
                         against him, I am suspending Colonel 
                         Blake from all his duties during the 
                         investigation, which I will conduct 
                         myself. I will also serve as your 
                         Commanding Officer during that time. 
                         I shall be calling on a number of 
                         you for your individual testimony on 
                         the points at issue.

               Thank you. Carry on.

               INT. DENTAL CLINIC  NIGHT

               Hawkeye, Duke and Painless are playing poker with a British, 
               a Norwegian and an Australian officer. It is close to two 
               o'clock the same night. General Hammond opens the door and 
               looks in, doesn't like what he sees and steps inside. All 
               six players are immediately aware of his presence but decide 
               to act as if they weren't.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to British Officer, 
                              who is dealing)
                         Gimme three.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a 
                         seriously wounded patient for whom 
                         you are responsible. Yet I find you 
                         in a poker game.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You betcher ass, Dad.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         What?

                                     BRITISH OFFICER
                         One to the dealer.
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         You're the opener.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Check.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Pierce! That soldier requires 
                         immediate attention. I'm a surgeon 
                         and I know.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         You betcher ass, General.

                                     BRITISH OFFICER
                         I'll wager a dollar.

                                     DUKE
                         I fold.

                                     PAINLESS
                         See the bet.

                                     NORWEGIAN OFFICER
                         Me likewise.

               Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Are you going to take care of your 
                         patient or are you going to play 
                         poker?

                                     BRITISH OFFICER
                         King-high flush.

               Painless and the Norwegian throw in their hands, and the 
               Englishman pulls in the pot.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to the general)
                         I'm going to play poker until three 
                         a.m. or until the patient is ready 
                         for surgery. However, if you'd like 
                         to operate on him yourself right 
                         now, be my guest. I get the same 
                         dough whether I work or not.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         I want to talk to you, Pierce.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         There's nothing to talk about, 
                         General. You take the case yourself 
                         or join me at three o'clock. Either 
                         way you're liable to learn something.

               The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded 
               him, but as the poker players start a new hand, he decides 
               against making an issue on terms selected by Hawkeye. Instead 
               he turns around and goes out.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Ugly John is attending a Korean soldier on the operating 
               table with a belly wound. The OR clock reveals that the time 
               is 2:55. Hawkeye and Seidman look in.

                                     UGLY JOHN
                         He's practically there.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Seidman)
                         Please ask General Hammond to join 
                         us.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. SURGEONS' WASH-UP ROOM  NIGHT

               General Hammond joins Hawkeye at the scrub sink, prepared to 
               take part in the coming operation.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         General, at one-thirty when I checked 
                         him last, this guy had had less than 
                         a pint of blood, and he'd lost two 
                         or three. His pulse then was 120 and 
                         his blood pressure was about 90. 
                         Now, at three o'clock, he's had three 
                         pints of blood. His pulse is 80 and 
                         his pressure 120. His collapsed lung 
                         has been expanded and he's had a 
                         gram of terramycin intravenously. We 
                         can operate on him safely and we 
                         should do it quickly, but we don't 
                         have to do it frantically or 
                         carelessly.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Hawkeye has been doing the repair work in the patient's belly, 
               with General Hammond functioning as a largely nonparticipating 
               assistant.

               The incision is still open with sections of bowel on which 
               repairs have been done still exposed.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Now, General, I'm going to sandbag 
                         you. Do you think we're ready to get 
                         out of this belly?

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Obviously you don't think so, and I 
                         don't know why.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes 
                         in the large bowel. They've all been 
                         in the small bowel, but the smell is 
                         different. I caught a whiff of large 
                         bowel, but it ain't staring us in 
                         the face, right?

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Right.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         So if it ain't staring us in the 
                         face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. 
                         And that, along with the look of the 
                         wounds, makes me figure he's got a 
                         hole in his sigmoid colon that we 
                         won't find unless we look for it.

               He has been working all the time he has been talking, and 
               now, after a little more manipulation within the incision, 
               is able to indicate the perforation he has hypothecated.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         And there it is.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, 
                         the kind of job I have, I don't get 
                         much chance to keep up with what 
                         goes on in the OR.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll 
                         tell you what makes him the best 
                         C.O. you've got in any of your 
                         hospitals. He leaves all the medical 
                         decisions to the men who do the day-
                         to-day work and understand what 
                         meatball surgery is.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. THE SWAMP  DAY

               The following day. General Hammond is having a drink with 
               Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke. Ho-Jon keeps the glasses full.

                                     TRAPPER
                         It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot 
                         Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.

                                     DUKE
                         Or her figger.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         She's so square she's even against 
                         our having a football team.

               This stirs the General's curiosity, but Duke speaks before 
               he has a chance to ask his question.

                                     DUKE
                         You don't think we'd be speaking up 
                         for a goddam Regular Army colonel, 
                         do you, if it wasn't important? 
                         Begging your pardon, General. I 
                         forgot.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                              (to Hawkeye)
                         Football?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Anybody you replaced Henry with 
                         couldn't last. We guarantee that.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         I didn't know you had a football 
                         team.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Well, it's still pretty much in the 
                         talk stage.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         We had a team at the 325th Evac last 
                         fall. I coached the boys myself.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I think I heard about that.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Now we're working out a schedule of 
                         the outfits we're going to play this 
                         year. We all chip into a pool and 
                         make bets.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Must be fun. But the point we want 
                         to make about Henry...

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                              (rising)
                         I'm sure we could find a date for 
                         your team. Why don't I take it up 
                         with Henry?
                              (exiting)
                         Thanks for the drink, boys.

               After the General has left, the other two Swampmen look at 
               Hawkeye uncomprehendingly.

                                     DUKE
                         Where the hell we going to get us a 
                         football team?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         All three of us played for our 
                         schools. And there are at least four 
                         other guys...

                                     TRAPPER
                         But he's got five times the man-power 
                         to draw on.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We can balance that by getting 
                         ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say 
                         he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a 
                         specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon 
                         Jones.

                                     DUKE
                         Never heard of him.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' 
                         Jones.

                                     DUKE
                         The nigra boy with the Philadelphia 
                         Eagles?

                                     TRAPPER
                         He only lasted one season.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         On account he got caught in the doctor 
                         draft. He was a surgical resident 
                         playing semi-pro ball weekends when 
                         the Eagles signed him.

                                     DUKE
                         How come nobody knows about him? And 
                         you do?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I worked with Spearchucker my first 
                         month over here, at the 72nd Evac in 
                         Taegu. Most of the colored guys know 
                         who he is but they're not talking 
                         because he asked them not to.

                                     TRAPPER
                         So what makes you think he'll play 
                         for us?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We'll cut him in on the bets we make. 
                         And still have enough profit to send 
                         Ho-Jon to college.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Might make kind of a social issue, 
                         not having any other Negro officer.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         He can move in here with us.

                                     DUKE
                         Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a 
                         long way, learning to put up with a 
                         couple of crazy Yankees, but...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Don't tell me about your problems, 
                         boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.

               INT. HENRY'S OFFICE  DAY

               Henry, nervous at what he thinks is going to be his showdown 
               with General Hammond, is startled by the General's unexpected 
               proposal.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         If we had closer relations, there 
                         wouldn't be any misunderstandings. 
                         That's where a football game would 
                         help. Between your outfit and mine.

                                     HENRY
                         A football game?

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Special Services in Tokyo are all 
                         for it. They say it's one of the 
                         main gimmicks we have to keep the 
                         American way of life going here in 
                         Asia.

                                     HENRY
                         But what about Major Houlihan?

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

                                     HENRY
                         N-n-no thanks, G-General.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH  DAY

               It is September. A helicopter descends to the ground in the 
               familiar location and, as on earlier occasions, Medical 
               Corpsmen come from the hospital to aid in unloading it. But 
               this time the cargo, instead of wounded men, turns out to be 
               boxes which the corpsmen rip open and which contains football 
               uniforms: black shoes, cardinal red jerseys, white helmets 
               and white pants.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE  DAY

               A day or two later. Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from 
               the chopper load. Practice at this point is confined to 
               kicking and passing the three footballs at their disposal, 
               and the uniforms still look clean and new. Trapper is a good 
               passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average receiver, and Duke 
               punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are dropped 
               more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is 
               pretty ragged. Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly 
               John, Boone, Painless and Judson. On the sidelines watching 
               are Henry, with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital 
               tubing around his neck, and, in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a 
               very big, broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         If I can make a suggestion, Coach.

                                     HENRY
                         The way I run an organization, any 
                         man in it has the right to speak his 
                         mind.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         In that case, here are ten basic 
                         plays. I think that's about all this 
                         bunch can handle.

               He hands Henry ten sheets of paper, on each of which a running 
               or pass play is diagrammed down to the finest detail.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll 
                         certainly take a look at these. Where 
                         the hell did you ever get that name?

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         I used to throw the javelin.

               Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the ball 
               right to where Henry and Spearchucker are standing.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Listen, we look pretty lousy out 
                         there, right?

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         Well, for college players that have 
                         been out of training seven or eight 
                         years...

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I'm thinking about how we can make 
                         more money.
                              (to Henry)
                         Suppose we bet only part of our dough 
                         and keep this big animal out of the 
                         game the whole first half and let 
                         them roll up some points. Then you 
                         could bet the rest of our bundle 
                         between the halves and get the General 
                         and his friends to give us some real 
                         odds.

                                     HENRY
                         It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         It's the only way we can make enough 
                         to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.

               EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               It is November. The Mash team, in uniform, comes out of the 
               quonset hut assigned to it as dressing quarters. Already on 
               the bench toward which the players head are a few supporters 
               including Dago Red, Knocko and Leslie. Radar is also there 
               serving as water boy.

               Spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held 
               together at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being 
               recognized as he looks over their opponents, who now file 
               out of their quonset hut.

               The first notable thing about them is that they number twenty-
               five as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the 
               Mash team.

               Second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them, 
               one black and one white are enormous, bigger than 
               Spearchucker. The uniforms are orange and black.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         Those two big guys were tackles on 
                         the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead 
                         played halfback with the Rams.

                                     HENRY
                         They can't do that to me!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         The bastards outconned us.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         I think we could still have a chance.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         If you start the game instead of 
                         waiting, you mean?

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         No, let's stick to that strategy 
                         till we see whether you boys can do 
                         two things. The first is get that 
                         halfback out of the game. He had one 
                         year with the Rams before the Army 
                         got him, but he didn't play too often 
                         because he's one of those hot dogs.

                                     DUKE
                         What?

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         When he sees a little running room, 
                         he likes to make a show... you know, 
                         stutter steps and cross-overs and 
                         all that jazz. Also he never learned 
                         to button up when he gets hit, so if 
                         you two can get a good shot at him 
                         once, you can hurt him.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         But we'd have to break his leg or 
                         something to keep him out of the 
                         game for good.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Not necessarily.

                                     UGLY JOHN
                         As long as there's a pile-up, we can 
                         do our bit to encourage his permanent 
                         withdrawal from the contest.

                                     TRAPPER
                         It's a technique Ugly John and I 
                         worked out in case something like 
                         this came up.

                                     DUKE
                              (gazing across at 
                              opposition tackles)
                         Look at the size of those two beasts.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I don't think I could hurt one of 
                         them with a sledgehammer.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         You can make them run. They've got 
                         the occupational disease of oversized 
                         ex-athletes. They're carrying thirty 
                         pounds extra apiece. So we run 
                         everything wide, wide, wide... make 
                         them move more then they want to on 
                         every play.

               EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               The Mash team is lined up to kick off, which is Duke's 
               function.

               There is only one official, a REFEREE, dressed in conventional 
               white.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         The pro halback is playing safety. 
                         Kick it to anybody else.

               Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled 
               to his left. But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard 
               line simply runs to his left and back a little toward his 
               own goal line in order to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he 
               charges downfield from his safety position. He sidesteps, 
               straight-arms or otherwise eludes all eleven of the Mash 
               players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown. A few moments 
               later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after 
               touchdown.

                                     HENRY
                              (screaming from 
                              sidelines)
                         Stop him! Stop that man!

                                     DUKE
                              (as they line up to 
                              receive)
                         Sure, you just blindfold him first 
                         and tie him to a stake.

               Duke is the one to receive the kickoff, which he takes on 
               the ten.

               He runs it back about twenty yards, dodging several enemy 
               tacklers, then sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing 
               down on him. Duke runs back and forth sideways a few times, 
               not gaining any ground but making the other man move.

                                     DUKE
                         Hawkeye!

               He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye, toward whom both tackles 
               from Cleveland now run. Hawkeye leads them almost from one 
               side of the field to the other, then reverses direction, 
               keeping them on the move till he sees a chance to throw a 
               lateral to Trapper.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                              (from the bench)
                         That's the stuff! Run the hams off 
                         those big hogs!

               Trapper returns the ball to Duke, who manages to make a couple 
               of yards forward and a lot more sideways before the Ram 
               halfback cuts him down from the rear. The Mash team goes 
               into its first huddle.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to huddle)
                         Okay, don't give them a chance to 
                         get their breath. Hawkeye wide to 
                         the right.

               They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winged T 
               formation. Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the center, 
               runs back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at 
               left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes 
               him all the way to the right sideline with the two Cleveland 
               tackles in pursuit.

               Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one 
               of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards.

               On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but his 
               blockers are of no use against the pro tackles, whom he sees 
               descending on him. Trapper starts running straight back for 
               a while, then makes a dash to the right followed by a dash 
               to the left. He is almost tackled again, and his only route 
               of escape is back toward his own goal line.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                              (from the sideline)
                         Throw it! Throw it!

               Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots 
               Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the 
               ball to him.

               Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and 
               he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play. 
               Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the 
               opposition any rest, the team huddles.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to huddle)
                         Wide to the left. Duke, you're the 
                         pacesetter this time.

               They go into action again. This time Trapper, taking the 
               ball from Vollmer, gives it to Duke, who makes a feint at an 
               off-tackle play, then turns back and into a wide end run 
               instead. Duke is still a good ball carrier by college 
               standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs 
               who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a running 
               duel with the professionals. When they finally nab him, he 
               is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage 
               line, but the ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting 
               and wishing they hadn't allowed all that extra poundage to 
               accumulate. On the fourth down, of course, they have to punt. 
               Duke goes back to receive the ball from Vollmer at center.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Don't try to get it far down. Kick 
                         it up high so we can get there and 
                         surround that son-ofa-bitch.

                                     DUKE
                         Yeah, if I can.

               He does a good job of it. The kick is high enough so there 
               are several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets 
               under it.

               He raises his right arm for a fair catch. The would-be Mash 
               tacklers, including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated. They 
               array themselves defensively while their opponents have a 
               huddle and line up to take the offense.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Duke and Trapper)
                         Let's get him this time. I don't 
                         think they've got anyone else who 
                         can carry the ball.

               As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips the 
               ball to the Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the tackle, 
               sees Hawkeye, untouched by blockers, closing in from the 
               outside, and makes his beautiful cross-over to cut back in. 
               At the same time he is hit at the knees by Hawkeye, and high 
               by Duke. And there are quite a few other Mash players in the 
               immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John in the forefront, 
               so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy 
               halfback.

               A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside 
               his jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extracts 
               a hypodermic needle. With the skill of an expert 
               anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled and 
               stunned halfback, and plunges the needle into his arm.

               The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash 
               players on top of the pile and orally expressing his 
               disapproval.

                                     REFEREE
                         Get off the guy! He's tackled. You 
                         don't all need to jump on.

               The Mash players quickly remove themselves. Duke and Hawkeye 
               are the last to get up. Remaining on the ground is the former 
               halfback for the Rams, still firmly clutching the ball but 
               looking as if he needed to get a lot of air into his lungs. 
               His captain, the white pro tackle, takes one look at him and 
               speaks to the Referee.

                                     325TH CAPTAIN
                         Time! Time!

               The Referee blows his whistle to stop the clock. The captain 
               waves for assistance from the sidelines, and the trainer and 
               water boy come running in. Radar also appears from the 
               opposite sideline with water for his team. Ugly John takes 
               advantage of his presence to slip the hypodermic he has been 
               concealing in his hand into Radar's pocket.

               Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the 
               Ram halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest 
               up. A couple of his teammates assist him to the bench. The 
               Mash players observe this.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Well, he's taken care of. Scratch 
                         one hot dog.

                                     DUKE
                         You really think we hurt him that 
                         bad?

                                     TRAPPER
                         Hell, no, all you did was knock the 
                         wind out of him. But he won't be 
                         playing any more football today.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. 325TH EVAC TEAM'S DRESSING ROOM  DAY

               It is between the halves and the General's players are 
               resting, especially the ex-Cleveland tackles, who are 
               stretched out prone.

               General Hammond and his TRAINER (a medical Corps Captain) 
               are concentrating on the ex-Los Angeles halfback, who sits 
               on a table looking groggy. Henry sticks his head in the door.

                                     TRAINER
                              (to Ram halfback)
                         The Trainer has to assist the man, 
                         and the moment he lets go of him, 
                         the halfback crumples to the floor.

                                     HENRY
                              (starting out again)
                         Sorry. You obviously won't be wanting 
                         any more bets.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         The hell we won't! You bastards pulled 
                         something, I don't know what, but 
                         we've been beating you without him. 
                         Ane we'll go on beating you!

                                     HENRY
                         You willing to b-back that up with 
                         odds?

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Damn right. Three to one, as much as 
                         you want to put up.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               The two teams have taken the field again. Hawkeye has switched 
               to left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield. 
               This time General Hammond's men are kicking off to Henry's. 
               It's a long kick but it doesn't go toward the center of the 
               goal line, where Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke, 
               who runs toward Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.

               The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as 
               to converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five. But 
               the other Mash players divide themselves into equal units of 
               five to do nothing but take out the two tackles. The other 
               opposing players are no problem for Spearchucker, who runs 
               around or right through them, and crosses their goal line 
               for a touchdown. The ball is brought out for the extra point 
               which Duke scores with a place kick. Before the teams 
               reassemble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th 
               team detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something 
               to General Hammond, whose reaction is to stand up and shake 
               his fist in Henry's direction. On the Mash bench, Radar leans 
               over to Henry.

                                     RADAR
                         General Hammond, sir, has just been 
                         informed about the identity of Captain 
                         Jones. His ringers recognized our 
                         ringer.

               On the field Duke is preparing to kick off.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (to Spearchucker)
                         What's the matter?

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         We may be in trouble, I can't catch 
                         my breath. I've got the occupational 
                         disease of oversized ex-athletes.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL  DAY

               Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass, 
               but the two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength 
               left to put him out of action with their combined efforts. 
               They block him so forcibly, in fact, that he drops to the 
               ground and has some trouble getting up. The pass is completed 
               and the receiver tackled on the Mash thirty-five yard line.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         Timeout!
                              (to Referee as latter 
                              blows whistle)
                         How much left?

                                     REFEREE
                         Minute and twenty-five seconds. And 
                         that's a first down.

               Radar comes out to the Mash huddle with his water-bucket and 
               towels.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         We got to stop them right here.

                                     DUKE
                         And get ourselves another touchdown 
                         to win.
                              (looking to opponents' 
                              huddle)
                         I wish to hell we knew what they 
                         were plotting.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (getting an idea)
                         Radar!

                                     RADAR
                         All you have to do is ask.
                              (concentrates on the 
                              huddle twelve yards 
                              away)
                         The quarterback is saying they'll 
                         run the old Statue of Liberty. Their 
                         left end will come across and take 
                         the ball out of his hand and try to 
                         get around our left end.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         What else?

                                     RADAR
                         Everyone's talking at once, but now 
                         the captain is telling them to shut 
                         up. The quarterback says, if the 
                         Statue of Liberty doesn't work, 
                         they'll go into the double wing with 
                         the left halfback taking the handoff 
                         first and then slipping it to the 
                         right halfback heading to the left.

               The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to 
               resume action. The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if 
               to pass, his left end starts to his right, and the whole 
               Mash eleven starts to their left. Only Ugly John finds himself 
               temporarily buried under a 265-pound tackle. The other ten 
               men in red meet the enemy left end after he takes the ball 
               off the quarterback's hand, and they bring him down for a 
               loss. The opposing team goes into another huddle but their 
               strategy remains as Radar overheard it. When the left halfback 
               starts to his right, the Mash players start to their right, 
               and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries 
               to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered. 
               Spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws 
               him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball. A 
               pile of half a dozen MASH players pounces on it, causing 
               some damage to each other.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                              (to Referee)
                         Time!

               He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with 
               him, then walks into his team's huddle.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Spearchucker)
                         You got to be the one. We're all 
                         agreed on that.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         No, it's too far and we're all too 
                         bushed. I just told the referee we're 
                         going to try something different. We 
                         make the center eligible by...

                                     VOLLMER
                         Me? I can't catch a pass.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         You don't have to. We line up with 
                         everybody to the right of center 
                         except Hawkeye, who drops back a 
                         yard just before the snap. At the 
                         same time Duke moves to the right 
                         side of the line.
                              (to Vollmer)
                         That makes you eligible but all you 
                         have to do is take the ball right 
                         back from Trapper between your legs 
                         and hide it under your belly. Trapper, 
                         you make like you got the ball, fake 
                         to me and keep going. One of the big 
                         guys will hit you, maybe both...

                                     TRAPPER
                         No! I only got my GI insurance.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                              (to Vollmer)
                         As soon as that happens, Sergeant, 
                         you start walking, not running to 
                         their goal line. Remember that, don't 
                         run! Come on, we just got time!

               They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, with 
               all the linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer's right. Their 
               opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more 
               confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the ball 
               from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and Duke 
               squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning the 
               ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout to 
               Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continues 
               backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and 
               were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he create 
               this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing 
               clearly that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, descend 
               on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other orange-
               and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vollmer, 
               holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide 
               the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a painful 
               blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at an 
               angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition think 
               he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury.

               Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks 
               back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove 
               themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye that 
               only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and 
               that he isn't paying much attention to him.

               From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight 
               of his center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.

                                     HENRY
                         What's going on? What the hell are 
                         you doing?

               He opens his arms enough for Henry to see the pigskin cradled 
               there.

                                     HENRY
                         Then run for God's sake! Run!

               Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line, which 
               has the unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to 
               what is happening.

               He races across the field to cut Vollmer off. Spearchucker 
               starts into motion at the same instant and gets down there 
               so fast that just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a 
               way that would throw him out of bounds on the two-yard line, 
               Spearchucker hurls himself against the safety man with a 
               strong and well-aimed block that sends both men across the 
               goal line.

               General Hammond runs onto the field in vehement protest.

                                     GENERAL HAMMOND
                         Illegal! Illegal!

               The Referee, looking at his watch and raising his Army .45 
               to signal the end of the game, goes over to meet the General 
               and explain the sad truth to him.

               INT. MASH TEAM'S DRESSING ROOM  DAY

               Some of the players are partly undressed but most of them 
               are too exhausted to begin that process. Trapper is stretched 
               out on a bench, apparently unconscious. Henry enters 
               triumphantly, waving a thick stack of paper money.

                                     HENRY
                         We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as 
                         Androscoggin... if there is such a 
                         place. And the big news is, the 
                         General wants a rematch.

                                     TRAPPER
                         I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring 
                         from football.

                                     DUKE
                         Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my 
                         last game.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Same here. You can retire my number.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, there's one big satisfaction.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         What's that, Henry?

                                     HENRY
                         I out-coached that General Hammond.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH  EVENING

               A covered Army truck pulls up with the victorious football 
               team breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing 
               a boisterous old drinking song. Several of them have bottles 
               in their hands as they descend to the ground. Hawkeye and 
               Duke are among the first and the noisiest until they notice 
               Lapham (the new surgeon we saw the first time during the 
               deluge) standing under the light at the hospital entrance. 
               There is something in his expression that makes them break 
               off their singing abruptly. Trapper and Spearchucker, jumping 
               down after them, react the same way, and their sudden silence 
               affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the singing 
               has died out entirely. Hawkeye and Duke run toward the 
               hospital entrance, Trapper and Spearchucker a little behind 
               them.

                                                          BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

               INT. AT HO-JON'S BEDSIDE  EVENING

               Ho-Jon is unconscious. Lapham holds an X-ray while Trapper 
               scans it.

                                     TRAPPER
                         It's a massive one.

               The X-ray is passed on to Hawkeye, Duke and Spearchucker in 
               turn.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         Isn't he awful young...?

                                     TRAPPER
                         That's the artery we sewed up last 
                         summer. Had to end up smaller, that 
                         much easier for the thrombosis to 
                         occur.

               Ho-Jon opens his eyes, slowly reacting to the pressure of 
               all the doctors.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Pain bad, Ho-Jon?

                                     HO-JON
                              (with considerable 
                              effort)
                         I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  
                         maneating  shark.

                                     TRAPPER
                              (to Lapham)
                         More demerol.

               Lapham goes off to get the medication.

                                     HO-JON
                         You  must  open  me  up  again?

                                     DUKE
                         No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open 
                         you up.

               Duke's words are intentionally ambiguous, and when Ho-Jon 
               looks from one doctor to another to find the real meaning of 
               them, they all try not to reveal it. But he knows.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. DENTAL CLINIC  DAY

               Hawkeye and Trapper are in a stud poker game along with 
               Painless, Vollmer, Radar, a helicopter pilot and the Norwegian 
               Officer we saw playing before. There is an entrance to the 
               hospital visible through a window, and an ambulance is parked 
               outside it.

                                     VOLLMER
                         Pair of sevens'll say a buck.

               The ambulance driver and another soldier come out of the 
               hospital bearing a shrouded corpse on a stretcher. Hawkeye, 
               choosing not to call the bet, turns over his cards, stands 
               up restlessly and sees the body on the stretcher. Trapper, 
               who has a view out the window from the seat, also sees it, 
               and the effect on him is to take his attention momentarily 
               from the game.

                                     PAINLESS
                         Make it two.

               The helicopter pilot folds his hand, and it's Trapper's turn 
               to be next. Radar, who is dealing, waits a moment to see if 
               he has to be reminded.

                                     RADAR
                         Two dollars to you, Trapper.

               Ho-Jon's body is tossed into the back of the ambulance. 
               Trapper checks his cards and turns them over.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Sorry. I'm out.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. MASH COMPOUND  NIGHT

               Three months later, a cold winter night with snow on the 
               ground.

               Hawkeye, in a heavy sweater, is running toward the brightly 
               lit hospital.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

               Spearchucker is doing a brain operation with Duke assisting. 
               Hawkeye comes in excitedly but stops within a few feet of 
               the operating table because he isn't sterile. He grabs a 
               surgical mask and holds it in front of his face as he speaks 
               to Duke.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Henry's got our orders! We're going 
                         home!

                                     DUKE
                         When?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Any time. Whenever we want.

                                     DUKE
                         Be right with you.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         You mind if we get out of this guy's 
                         brain first?

                                     DUKE
                         What's there to do? You found the 
                         sliver.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         There might be another tiny piece we 
                         missed. I want to look around before 
                         we close up.

                                     DUKE
                              (to Hawkeye, referring 
                              to Spearchucker)
                         Perfectionist.

               He works the retractor he is holding to spread the incision 
               while Spearchucker probes it.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         There's no transportation anyway 
                         this time of night.

                                     DUKE
                         We could steal one of the choppers.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         I looked. Suspicious bastards got 
                         them all locked up.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. THE SWAMP  DAY

               The next day, snow still on the ground. Ugly John is at the 
               wheel of a Jeep into which Hawkeye and Duke are storing the 
               same Valpacs and barracks bags they arrived with more than a 
               year before. There is a small group gathered to say goodbye, 
               including Dago Red, Lapham and Vollmer, who is Regular Army, 
               but none of the others who were part of the outfit when they 
               first arrived. When they are all ready to take off, Hawkeye 
               and Duke go back inside the Swamp.

               INT. THE SWAMP  DAY

               Trapper is drunk and gloomy, Spearchucker in fairly good 
               spirits.

               Duke pours small drinks into three glasses and adds some to 
               the drink Trapper is already holding.

                                     DUKE
                         Y'all mind the store.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Four goddam months. And they don't 
                         even give you time off for good 
                         behavior.

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (shaking hands with 
                              Spearchucker)
                         See you.

                                     SPEARCHUCKER
                         It's possible

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (extending hand to 
                              Trapper)
                         Hang in there.

                                     TRAPPER
                         Why don't you for Christ's sake get 
                         the hell out of here?

               And that's what they proceed to do.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. JAPANESE SEAPORT DOCK  DAY

               A couple of days later. Hawkeye and Duke are inspecting the 
               troopship on which they will make the long voyage to Seattle. 
               They have undergone a startling transformation: they have 
               had shaves and haircuts, and they have abandoned their 
               fatigues for clean, new-looking uniforms with Eisenhower 
               jackets adorned with their proper insignia, including a 
               caduceus of the Medical Corps. There is a lot of activity on 
               board the ship and on the dock, where a MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT 
               with a notebook accosts them.

                                     MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Excuse me, gentlemen, but are you 
                         sailing on the troopship tomorrow?

                                     DUKE
                         That's right.

                                     MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         May I have your names, please?

                                     DUKE
                         Sure, my...

                                     HAWKEYE
                              (overlapping)
                         What for?

                                     MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         We need medical officers for short-
                         arm inspection starting the first 
                         afternoon out.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is 
                         Captain George Limburger, and this 
                         is Captain Walter Camembert.

                                     MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                              (writing)
                         C-A-M-E-M...?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.

                                     MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work 
                         out of the hospital here.

               He salutes them and goes on his way.

                                     DUKE
                              (indicating his 
                              shoulder insignia)
                         I thought we were heading for trouble 
                         putting on all these trinkets.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, 
                         if we want to be halfway human by 
                         the time we get back to our wives.

                                     DUKE
                         But no short-arm inspection. I'm 
                         with you there.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Screw it. We been earning our keep 
                         as respectable knife artists. Why 
                         should we do work any pill-rolling 
                         punk could handle?

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. HARBOR  DAY

               The big troopship is making its way out of the harbor and 
               heading for open ocean.

               EXT. TROOPSHIP  DAY

               A SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT walks along the deck at the 
               officers' end of the ship.

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Captain Limburger! Captain Camembert!

               All he gets in response are funny looks and laughter. By the 
               time he comes near where Hawkeye and Duke are standing, the 
               Sergeant is beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar 
               about the names he is calling. For added protection Hawkeye 
               and Duke have replaced their Medical Corps insignia with the 
               simple cross of the Chaplain's Corps.

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Excuse me, Sergeant.

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Yes, Reverend?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         What do you want with those two 
                         medical officers?

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         They're supposed to hold short-arm 
                         inspection.

                                     DUKE
                         You can't be serious, man.

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Why not?

                                     DUKE
                         The reason they're being shipped 
                         home is they're the two biggest 
                         fairies in the Far East Command.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Be the longest short-arm inspection 
                         you ever held!

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                         Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for 
                         tipping me off.
                              (consulting list)
                         You don't know a Captain Forrest or 
                         a Captain Pierce, do you?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         They missed the boat.

                                     SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
                              (making a note)
                         Thanks.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Glad to help.

               The Segeant goes off in one direction, Duke and Hawkeye in 
               another.

               Pretty soon they come across a dice game and stop to watch.

                                     DUKE
                         This a closed game or you take 
                         anybody's dough?

               A couple of the DICE PLAYERS look up and react adversely to 
               the Chaplain's Corps insignia.

                                     FIRST DICE PLAYER
                         Well, almost anybody's.

                                     SECOND DICE PLAYER
                              (apologetically, to 
                              Duke)
                         Kind of a rough game, Reverend.

                                     DUKE
                         Hell, man, that don't matter. We're 
                         loaded. We were big wheels in the 
                         black market in Seoul.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Plus running the opium concession 
                         for the whole Eighth Army.

               These confessions arouse the interest of all the players. 
               One, a SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN, looks at them intently, then 
               smiles.

                                     SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
                         They're not chaplains at all. They're 
                         doctors from the 4077th Mash. I had 
                         a piece of steel dug out of my back 
                         there.

               The player who told them it was a rough game, an infantry 
               captain, extends his hand to greet them.

                                     SECOND DICE PLAYER
                         Pleasure to have you. Lot of my men 
                         went through your outfit.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Glad to know you. Listen, we're 
                         ducking short-arm inspection but our 
                         cover isn't going to last long. How 
                         would you two boys like to do us a 
                         favor? Be Forrest and Pierce of the 
                         Medical Corps between here and 
                         Seattle.

                                     SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
                         We wouldn't know how to go about it.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Nothing to it. You just turn a chair 
                         around backwards and rest your chin 
                         on the top. You sit there with a big 
                         cigar in your mouth and and every 
                         now and then, just to show you're 
                         looking, you say, 'Don't wave it so 
                         close to my cigar, soldier.' That's 
                         all you do. You can't go wrong.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. U.S. CIVILIAN AIRLINER  NIGHT

               It is March. A STEWARDESS with a stern look approaches Duke 
               and Hawkeye. Duke is sucking on a bottle of scotch.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         I've told you twice to put away that 
                         bottle. Now I'll have to ask the 
                         captain to come back and speak to 
                         you.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Never mind your captain, honey.
                              (takes bottle from 
                              Duke and puts it 
                              away)
                         I'll take care of mine. Till we land 
                         in Chicago.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. MEN'S ROOM  MIDWAY AIRPORT  CHICAGO  NIGHT

               The bottle of scotch stands on a shelf over the wash basins. 
               Duke is combing his hair, Hawkeye shaving.

                                     ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                              (over loudspeaker 
                              system)
                         Flight 616 for Cincinnati, Knoxville 
                         and Atlanta, now boarding at Gate 
                         Five.

               Hawkeye reaches for the bottle, hands it to Duke, who takes 
               a sip and passes it back. Hawkeye kills it and throws it 
               into a trash can.

                                     DUKE
                         Let's hear from you, you goddam 
                         Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Like the Spearchucker said, that's 
                         possible. Anyway, it's been an 
                         interesting association.

               Duke picks up his bags and starts out. Hawkeye resumes 
               shaving.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               INT. ATLANTA AIRPORT  DAY

               Duke is among the passengers entering the airport from an 
               incoming flight. He spots his wife and two daughters, now 
               three and one-and-a-half. He starts eagerly toward them but 
               we never get a distinct look at them.

                                                                TIME LAPSE:

               EXT. ROCKLAND, MAINE AIRPORT  DAY

               Here incoming passengers can be met outside the terminal 
               building.

               Hawkeye disembarks from a Northeast Airlines Convair and 
               sees his wife waiting for him with their sons, aged five and 
               three. The older one lets go his mother's hand, dashes out 
               to his father and jumps into his arms.

                                     FIVE-YEAR-OLD
                         How they goin', Hawkeye?

                                     HAWKEYE
                         Finest kind.

               He looks toward his wife, but we don't see her in clear focus.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
