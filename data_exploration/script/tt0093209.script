               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - SEPTEMBER 1939 - DAY

               COLOUR

               Raking down a line of suburban gardens lit by a late-summer
               sun. Heads move back and forth above the fences that divide
               the narrow strips of land, moving to the sound of unseen
               lawn mowers.


               In one of these gardens two children, BILL (aged eight) and
               his sister SUE (aged six) disport themselves. They are
               sprawled out on the lawn, heads and hands intent on
               something hidden from view in the lush vegetation of a
               rockery garden. Beneath those flowers and plants is a dark
               and mysterious forest, shaded by huge leaves, and broken up
               by towering boulders. Mounted figures of medieval knights
               ride in, guided by BILL'S gigantic hand. A wizard appears
               in the path of the riders who draw up sharply. BILL gives
               an impression of neighing horses. SUE'S face looms up
               between large leaves. She makes the sound of spooky wind.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               In the penumbra of the room, the mother, GRACE, in droopy
               flowered frock, crosses, floats towards the walnut wireless
               and, with trembling hand, switches it on. Its green dial
               glows with stations like Droitwich and Hilversum. She
               glides back and drapes herself behind an armchair in which
               her husband, CLIVE, sits solemn and motionless.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               The sound of the lawn-mower ceases abruptly. BILL looks up
               sharply. The neighbours' heads come to rest on top of the
               garden fences. They turn, listening. BILL inclines his head
               towards the french windows, sensing the dread moment. He
               walks towards the door and is framed there. He regards his
               parents.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               They look back with unseeing, inward-turned eyes. Young
               BILL gathers confused fragments of the fateful
               announcement.

                                   CHAMBERLAIN (V.O)
                         ...those assurances... by eleven
                         o'clock... a state of war... that
                         this country... at war with
                         Germany.

               The boy catches his mother's eye. She smiles en embarrassed
               smile. The boy is embarrassed by her embarrassment. His
               father's glassy solemnity angers him. In the garden, SUE
               sings.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                         Flat foot floogie with a Floy
                         Floy.

               BILL turns to his sister.

                                   BILL
                         Stop that, Sue!

               CLIVE is startled out of his funereal reverie.

                                   BILL
                         She just sings it. She doesn't
                         know what it means.

               An older sister, DAWN, a tumescent fifteen, stumbles into
               the room in a nightdress.

                                   DAWN
                         Where are my stockings? I can't
                         find my stockings!

               Her mother, GRACE, interrupts her with outstretched arms.

                                   GRACE
                         Dawn, darling. They've started a
                         war again.

               GRACE says it as though announcing that dinner is served,
               but her voice is torn by a sob as she holds DAWN in her
               arms.

                                   GRACE
                             (Whispering and sobbing)
                         We mustn't frighten the little
                         ones.

               DAWN is appalled by her mother's display of sentiment. She
               wrenches free.

                                   DAWN
                         I don't care! I want my
                         stockings!

               CLIVE get's up, blazing. He seizes DAWN and shakes her.

                                   CLIVE
                         Stockings? War! Don't you
                         understand! War!

                                   DAWN
                         I don't care!

                                   CLIVE
                         War! War!

               GRACE inserts herself between them.

                                   GRACE
                         Clive. Don't. Dawn, please.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               BILL calls out from the garden. He is jumping up and down,
               pointing at the sky.

                                   BILL
                         German planes! German planes!

               They run out. GRACE sweeps little SUE into her arms, buring
               her face in her bosom and rushing back into the shelter of
               the house. DAWN and CLIVE scan the sky for planes, There
               are none.

                                   BILL
                         I did see them. I did.

                                   DAWN
                         He's the worst liar.

               DAWN swings a fist at BILL and chases him inti the room,
               raining savage blows upon him.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Father is white with rage. He seizes them, one in each
               hand. Mother cowers with SUE.

                                   CLIVE
                         These are the fruits of my loins?

               DAWN lunges at BILL. The GRANDMOTHER enters, tall, frail,
               elegant, ga-ga, deaf.

                                   GRANDMA
                         Is it peace in out time?

                                   GRACE
                             (shouting)
                         No, Mother! It's War! War!

                                   GRANDMA
                         Or what?

                                   GRACE:
                         War! War! War!

               The wireless begins to play 'God Save the King'. Father
               immediately lets go of the children and stands rigidly to
               attention.
               The others simmer down and shuffle into stiff and still
               poses. GRANDMOTHER, who perhaps cannot hear the Anthem, is
               baffled, shakes her head.



               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               The sirens sound. A shocking blast of noises, the sickening
               ululations of the air-raid warning. They call out over the
               rows of bow-fronted semi-detached, lower-middle-class
               houses. Some of the occupants, more daring or more confused
               than their neighbours, burst out of their front doors,
               turning in frenzied circles, craning at the heavens.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               The rigid family once more jerks into movement at the sound
               of the siren, looking forcefully out of the french windows,
               hiding under the table, clutching each other. The siren
               stops. They wait, anxiously. Silence. Even the birds
               stopped singing at the wailing of the first siren. This was
               perhaps the worst moment of the war, the first moment, when
               war was still an unknown dread thing. The siren again, but
               this time, a long sustained note.

                                   CLIVE
                         That's the all-clear. Testing.
                         They were just testing.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE walks tentatively into the garden, looking up,
               shielding his eyes against the sun. The others join Him,
               one by one.

                                   GRACE
                         Such a beautiful day too.

               All search the clear blue sky. The sound of the lawn-mower
               starts up again where it left off before the war.

                                   SUE
                             (singing)
                         Flat Foot Floogie with a Floy
                         Floy.



               INT. CINEMA - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A Ministry of Information film advises and demonstrates how
               to glue strips of paper to windows to avoid flying glass,
               and how to construct an air-raid shelter. On the
               soundtrack, in addition to the patronizing commentary
               voice, is the sound of hundreds of screaming children.

               BILL and SUE sit among the children's matinee audience. The
               children pay no attention to the screen, but fight and
               shout, throw things at each other, jump over seats, cry,
               wander up and down the aisles.

               The soundtrack changes to dramatic music and a
               transformation takes place. All movement and talking
               ceases. Hundreds of rapt faces stare at the screen where
               Hopalong Cassidy rides into action.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               COLOUR

               CLIVE has put an Anderson shelter at the end of the small
               garden, He is shovelling earth on to its humped corrugated
               metal roof. His friend, MAC, is watching him.

                                   CLIVE
                         Going to put a rockery garden
                         over it, Mac.

               BILL's voice echoes from inside the shelter.

                                   BILL (O.S.)
                         Dad. It's full of water again.

               CLIVE and MAC peer in to see the boy splashing up and down,
               water over his ankles. He clutches his submerged foot in
               mock agony.

                                   BILL
                         Crocodiles! Aah!

                                   CLIVE
                         The sodding water table.

                                   MAC
                         Could you seal it over with hot
                         pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the
                         hull of a ship.

                                   CLIVE
                             (caustic)
                         Thanks. I hope you can come for
                         the launching.

               INT/EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN/GARDEN - DAY

               The windows are criss-crossed with brown paper. Beyond, in
               the garden, MAC has taken off his jacket and is shovelling
               earth onto the shelter. BILL walks barefoot towards the
               house, carrying his wet socks and shoes in his hands.

                                   MOLLY
                         It's not fair on them. It's
                         selfish to keep them with you.

                                   GRACE
                         My aunt in Australia has
                         offered..

               BILL sits on the steps at the half-open kitchen door and
               wrings the water from his socks. SUE comes in and GRACE
               signals MOLLY to be circumspect, but she blunders on.

                                   MOLLY
                         Snap it up. Great chance for
                         them. Lot more future out there.

               BILL listens, talking it all in. GRACE Watches little SUE
               waddle out carrying planes.

                                   GRACE
                         It's so far way. I couldn't bear
                         it.

                                   MOLLY
                         Kids don't care. You're thinking
                         of yourself.

               GRACE turns away. Fighting back tears. MOLLY impulsively
               takes GRACE in her arms.

                                   MOLLY
                         I didn't mean it like that,
                         Grace. Why does it always come
                         out wrong?

                                   GRACE
                         I know you mean well.

               MOLLY laughs and holds her at arms length.

                                   MOLLY
                         There you go again. You're so
                         bloody nice. I want to shake you.

               She does, mock serious.

                                   GRACE
                         Nothing will ever be the same
                         again, Molly. And the funny thing
                         is, I'm glad.

               MOLLY looks at her, surprised.

                                   MOLLY
                         Now you're talking.

               SUE listening to this, sees BILL on the steps and gives him
               a questioning look. He shrugs, trying to conceal his
               anxiety from his sister.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               DAWN lies in bed, head buried in pillows in that deepest of
               all sleep, the Sunday morning adolescent lie-in. BILL
               shakes her, jumps on top of her, imitates an air-raid
               warning, tries to pull off the bedclothes but she holds
               them tight.

                                   BILL
                         There's a soldier at he door,
                         looking for you.

               She whips back the sheet, wide awake. One look at his face
               is enough to see that he is lying.

                                   DAWN
                         You're the biggest fibber.

                                   BILL
                         It's dinner time. It really is.
                         Cross my heart.

               She snakes out an arm and pulls him into bed. She rolls on
               top of him, tickling him and smothering him with kisses.

                                   DAWN
                         If there's no solider, I'll have
                         you instead.

               He giggles and struggles, gets into a panic, but she is
               merciless, won't stop. Finally he starts to cry. She leaps
               out of bed, disgusted with him.

                                   DAWN
                         Cry baby Bunting.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GRACE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLIVE rummages in the wardrobe, chuckling to himself. He
               finds his Sam Browne belt and Army cap from the First Wold
               War.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               MOLLY and GRACE and GRANDMA have 'gin and its', the men
               brown ale. They are in high spirits. SUE is doing a puzzle
               on the floor. MOLLY shouts into GRANDMA'S ear.

                                   MOLLY
                         Few bombs might wake up this
                         country.

               GRACE fills MAC'S glass in a tender gesture. A look passes
               between them. MOLLY is a friend and wife, they love and
               suffer in common. DAWN appears, wearing a defiant slash of
               lipstick.

                                   GRACE
                         I doubt if a few bombs would wake
                         up Dawn on a Sunday morning.

                                   DAWN
                         This phoney war get's on my
                         nerves. If we're going to have a
                         war, I wish they'd get it
                         started.

                                   GRACE
                         Just ignore her, Mac.

               CLIVE appears having stripped to the waist but wearing his
               Sam Browne from the First Wold War. They all shriek with
               laughter. CLIVE, encouraged by this response, does drill
               movements and then demonstrates how to salute.

                                   CLIVE
                         There are many ways of saluting..
                             (He demonstrates.)
                         ..An old soldier insulting a
                         young subaltern.

               His hand flies to his forehead, gouging the air, the salute
               transformed into an obscene gesture. More laughter.

                                   CLIVE
                         As an officer, you counter that
                         with one of these.

               He raises his arm slowly and languidly until his limp hand
               just brushes his temple. A faraway look in his eyes
               disdains any acknowledgement of the insulting salute. A
               tiny skirmish in the class war.

               BILL and SUE swing on the leather straps of the Sam Browne.
               They want him to stop. They sense something dangerous,
               alien, their father in an unfamiliar role, another person.

               The wireless has been on all this time, playing music and
               now come the chimes of Big Ben. It is news time. The adults
               are suddenly stock-still and serious, leaving the children
               stranded in an excited state..

                                   NEWSREADER (V.O.)
                         Here is the news and this is
                         Alvar Lidell reading it.

               The children are told to be quiet. The room becomes a
               frieze of portentous concentration.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               BILL slips into the garden, looks up at the leaden sky
               imploringly.

                                   BILL
                         Come on. Come on.

               The news bulletin filters out into the garden. Norway has
               fallen, perhaps, or Churchill become Prime Minister.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The meal has been eaten. They are animated again, but more
               reflective, DAWN is winding wool with GRANDMA. BILL and SUE
               have also left the table. BILL is looking at the Sam
               Browne, now slung over the armchair, with its tangy smell
               of deep polish like shiny milk chocolate, a mysterious icon
               of war. The conversation at the table drifts over to him.

                                   MAC
                         ...It was a toss-up. His company
                         went to India, mine went to
                         France. Flip of a coin.

                                   CLIVE
                         ...two Indians to fan me all
                         night. The heat.

                                   MAC
                         ....buried In a shell-hole for
                         thee days, while he's out there
                         playing polo and sticking pigs.

                                   GRACE
                         It was the best time of his life.

                                   MAC
                         How many of our class left? You
                         and me out of twenty-eight.

                                   CLIVE
                         And Jim.

                                   MAC
                         What's left of him. He'll never
                         see outside of the Star and
                         Garter.

               BILL sinks his teeth into Same Browne. He bites hard and is
               pleased to see that his teeth marks go quite deep into the
               leather.

                                   CLIVE
                         I rode into battle...

               DAWN, winding wool, knows this speech by heart and mimes it
               silently with her father.

                                   CLIVE
                         ...On horseback, with a drawn
                         sword, leading a battalion of
                         Gurkhas against the Turks.

               GRANDMA watches DAWN'S moving lips and strains to hear.

                                   GRANDMA
                         I can't hear you.

                                   MOLLY
                         And where were the Turks?

               She also knows the story.

                                   GRACE
                         No Turks.

                                   CLIVE
                         We didn't know that. It was a
                         suicide mission. Machetes against
                         artillery. Volunteers only.

                                   GRACE
                         They'd gone.

                                   MOLLY
                         Saw Clive coming.

               They all have a good laugh at CLIVE'S expense and he takes
               it well enough. BILL drifts over to his lead soldiers
               spread out in a corner of the room. They are an eclectic
               mix of cowboys, Indians, the Medieval Knights, as well as
               modern militia and a few farm animals.

                                   CLIVE
                         We all had to write a last letter
                         home.

                                   GRACE
                         And it was the last. Hasn't
                         written a letter since. Not even
                         a birthday card.

               BILL sets a mounted knight against a clutch of modern
               infantry.

                                   MAC
                         It's not like when you're in it.
                         Just young boys spilling their
                         guts in the mud.

                                   DAWN
                         What were they like, the Germans,
                         when you were a prisoner of war?

               BILL looks up with interest. The others fall silent.

                                   MAC
                         Most of them were very decent to
                         me.

                                   MOLLY
                         I wish you wouldn't go saying
                         that. You'll get into trouble.

                                   DAWN
                         You can speak German, can't you?

                                   MAC
                         A bit.

                                   DAWN
                         Say something. I want to know
                         what it sounds like.

                                   MOLLY
                         Certainly not!

                                   MAC
                         In den ganzen Welt die meisten
                         Leute sind dumm.

                                   MOLLY
                         Not so loud!



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Later. The two men are in post-prandial sleep in the
               armchairs on either side of the fire. Sounds of washing up
               and women's voices come from the kitchen. BILL walks up
               very close and examines the two warriors from the Great
               War, or the First Wold War, as it was now coming to be
               known. Their mouths are open, slack. His father's false
               teeth click up and down as he breathes. MAC shifts his
               backside in his sleep to let a fart up from the side of the
               leatherette armchair. BILL looks at CLIVE's mottled skin,
               the stubble, the sagging epidermis around the eyes. He goes
               to the mantelpiece and takes down a silver-framed picture
               of his father as a baby-faced second lieutenant wearing
               that same Sam Browne. BILL holds the picture next to his
               father's snoring face. Once again, a new bulletin begins on
               the ever-playing wireless.

                                   BILL
                         Dad, the News. It's the News.

               CLIVE stirs.

                                   CLIVE
                         Go off and play, son.

               BILL shakes him.

                                   BILL
                         But Dad, It's the News.

                                   CLIVE
                         Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm
                         not sleeping, just closing my
                         eyes.

               BILL is confused. He still feels it is his duty to wake
               him.

                                   BILL
                             (shouting)
                         The Germans! They've landed!

               GRACE and MOLLY appear at the door, alarmed. The men sleep
               on.

                                   BILL
                         Only joking.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE are in two beds, side by side. Between them is
               a crystal set and they are sharing the earphones listening
               to Itma or Much Binding in the Marsh. Their door is half
               open and a gust of shots and cries rises from below. BILL
               gets up and goes to the door.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLYWAY AND LANDING - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE venture out on to the landing and peer through
               the banisters to the hallway and front door below.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               MAC and MOLLY are leaving, as CLIVE and GRACE help them on
               with their coats. They have had a few more drinks, and are
               making sentimental farewells.

                                   MOLLY
                         Bloody gin. Always makes me cry.

                                   MAC
                         Got some wires crossed. Only
                         weeps when she's happy.

                                   GRACE
                         You're making me start now.

               MAC embarrasses her.

                                   MAC
                         Now, now Grace.

               He turns to CLIVE and takes him by the shoulders. They are
               both quiet drunk.

                                   MAC
                         Root it out Clive... the thought
                         of it, before it takes hold.

                                   CLIVE
                         Weeds will grow, Mac.

                                   MAC
                         Consider Grace, the kids. I love
                         them like my own. And you.

                                   CLIVE
                         Kiss me Hardy.

               As he mentions the children Molly wails anew.

                                   MOLLY
                         Why couldn't I have the kids? Is
                         he sitting up there... saying...
                         "Grace, yes; Molly, no?"

               GRACE holds her tight.

                                   GRACE
                         Better off, Molly. What's to
                         become of the poor mites!

               SUE'S face creases and tears well up. BILL puts a
               protective arm about her.

                                   MAC
                         You're a mug, Clive. We did our
                         bit in the Last Lot.

                                   CLIVE
                         If King and Country call, Mac,
                         you go as soon as I will.

               MAC'S face goes white with anger.

                                   MAC
                         What did we know? We were
                         seventeen.

                                   CLIVE
                             (with a far-off look)
                         I heard the drum and fife
                         yesterday, Mac, marching past.
                         Made my hair stand on end.
                         I thought, I've been asleep for
                         twenty years.

               MAC wants to hit him. He turns away, trembling.

                                   MAC
                         Go the Hell.

               He puts an arm about MOLLY and plunges into the blacked-out
               dark-winter-night. As GRACE turns back, she glimpses the
               children on the landing above.

                                   GRACE
                         Do you know what time it is? Go
                         back to bed, this instant.

               They dart out of sight.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE slide under the bedclothes. SUE is whimpering.

                                   BILL
                         We're not going to be like them
                         when we grow up. We're not even
                         like them now.

               He picks up the earphones and twiddles with the crystal
               wireless. It is the News again. BILL fiddles with the lead
               soldiers, his eyes getting heavy.



               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               Infantry advance as shells bust all about them. CLIVE and
               MAC push forward, side by side. MAC is hit, goes down,
               cries out for help, but CLIVE does not seem to notice.

               A muddy field. Silence. Aftermath of battle. BILL searches
               among the dead. They are half-buried, covered in mud, all
               one texture with the earth. BILL finds CLIVE and MAC, lying
               side by side, dead. He is quite unconcerned, pulls his
               father's Sam Browne which slips off easily. He wipes the
               mud away and starts to eat it. It seems to be made of
               chocolate.



               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

               COLOUR

               A 1938 Vauxhall 12 is parked outside a recruiting centre. A
               boisterous crowd of young men mills about, passing in and
               out, encouraging each other, cheering each new man who
               steps out a soldier.
               Next door is a pub and there is a continuous exchange of
               customers between the two establishments. BILL and SUE wait
               inside the car. She is whining in the back, sucking her
               thumb. BILL sits in the driving seat, pretending to drive,
               making all the right noises.

                                   SUE
                         He's never going to come back.
                         He's gone off to be a soldier and
                         Mummy doesn't even know.

                                   BILL
                         It doesn't matter, I can drive
                         the car home.

                                   SUE
                         You wouldn't.

                                   BILL
                         Would.

                                   SUE
                         You couldn't.

                                   BILL
                         Could.

               CLIVE, arm in arm with a PAL, comes out of the pub and over
               to the car. He gets in after much handshaking and back
               slapping.

                                   CLIVE
                         Sorry, kids. Joined up. I needed
                         some Dutch courage to tell your
                         mother.

               The PAL opens the passenger door and leans in.

                                   PAL
                         Never say die!

                                   CLIVE
                         Steady the Buffs.

                                   PAL
                         Up the Arsenal!

               CLIVE leans across and slams the door closed. The PAL waves
               at the window. CLIVE pulls away. The PAL runs alongside,
               waving. CLIVE laughs and waves back.

                                   CLIVE
                         He's one of the best.

               Still the PAL keeps up with the car, running frantically.

                                   SUE
                         Daddy you shut his hand in the
                         door.

               The PAL jumps on the running board and crouches there, red
               faced, eyes bulging. He waves desperately at the window.

                                   CLIVE
                         The silly bugger.

               He pulls up the and opens the door. The PAL clasps his hand
               and writhes in agony.

                                   CLIVE
                         You silly bugger. We're trying to
                         win a war and you start off by
                         shutting your fingers in the
                         bloody car door.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

               CLIVE is putting the car on blocks, taking off the wheels.
               BILL helps him.

                                   CLIVE
                         That's it for the duration.
                             (runs a duster over the
                              bodywork)
                         I shall miss the old girl. Pop in
                         and give her a polish, Billy boy.
                         Just now and then. A car needs to
                         be cherished.

               GRACE has appeared at the door and heard some of this.

                                   GRACE
                         Has Sue got it right?

                                   CLIVE
                         What's that?

                                   GRACE
                         You joined up.

                                   CLIVE
                         Oh, that.

                                   GRACE
                         I wish you could have told me
                         yourself.
                             (he takes Grace in his
                              arms.)
                         Oh, Grace, it's not for long.
                         They say it'll be over by
                         Christmas.

               CLIVE laughs and tickles her, trying to get round her, keep
               it light. GRACE laughs despite herself. BILL makes a face,
               disgusted by the show of sentiment.

                                   GRACE
                         Don't be so daft. Act your age.
                             (extricates herself)
                         I can't cope on my own. I'd
                         better let the children go.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE leads BILL out on to the lawn, goes down on one knee
               and puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. He looks solemnly
               into his son's eyes.

                                   CLIVE
                         Billy boy. Before I go, there's
                         something I want to tell you.
                         You're old enough now. It's time.
                             (produces a cricket ball
                              from his pocket.)
                         The Googly. Your hand is too
                         small to master it, but not to
                         start practising. Anyway, I'm
                         going to pass on the secret now,
                         father to son, in case anything
                         happens to me.
                             (demonstrates)
                         You know the off-break, right?

               He flicks the ball out of his wrist. BILL nods.

                                   CLIVE
                         And the leg-break?

               BILL knows that too. The ball comes out of his hand,
               spinning the other way.

                                   CLIVE
                         Now, the googly looks like a leg
                         break, but it's really an off
                         break. Got it? Like this.

                                   BILL
                         It's like telling fibs.

                                   CLIVE
                         That's it. When you tell a lie,
                         you hope to get away with it.
                         When someone else does, you want
                         to find them out. A good batsman
                         will spot a googly. A good bowler
                         will hide it. Always remember
                         that, son.

               BILL flicks the ball this way and that, experimenting.
               CLIVE watches him tenderly, a moment of perfect harmony. He
               folds BILL in his arms, holding him fast.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               BILL swings on the front gate looking back at his mother,
               SUE and DAWN bidding their farewells to CLIVE in a
               confusion of tears and forced gaiety.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT GARDEN - DAY

               CLIVE finally strides away, head high, a military spring
               already in his step. Behind him GRACE shuts the door as
               though closing a chapter of their lives.

                                   BILL
                         Dad! Dad!

               CLIVE, now some twenty yards away, looks back. BILL throws
               the cricket ball and CLIVE catches it neatly. He smiles and
               marches down Rosehill Avenue. BILL is puzzled as CLIVE
               shows no sign of returning the ball. He calls after him.

                                   BILL
                         Dad!

               CLIVE is now eighty yards down the street. He suddenly
               turns smiling broadly, and with a prodigious throw he send
               the ball in a high arc towards his son. BILL juggles his
               position, cups his hands, gets under it as the hard, heavy
               ball hurtles downwards. At the last moment he loses his
               nerve and jumps back, letting the ball thump onto the lawn.
               He looks towards CLIVE, full of shame. BILL is relieved to
               see that CLIVE has turned the corner.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               BILL winces as he and SUE are passed from hand to hand,
               hugged and kissed by many female members of the family -
               DAWN, GRANDMA and GRACE'S three sisters, FAITH, HOPE and
               CHARITY. MOLLY is on hand with MAC, the only male. On the
               table are the remains of the farewell party, an iced cake,
               balloons, gaudy wrapping paper. Encouraging cries fly
               about. "Aren't you lucky?" "Isn't it exciting?" "I wish I
               could hide in your suitcase." From the smothering embraces,
               BILL casts a pleading look to MAC who reaches out and hauls
               him from the women.

                                   MAC
                         You survived that. The war should
                         be no problem.

               GRACE ties a label to BILL'S lapel. It declares his name
               and other details.

                                   GRACE
                         Time to go.

               She leads the children out MAC follows, carrying two
               suitcases.



               EXT. WATERLOO STATION - DAY

               MAC and GRACE lead BILL and SUE into the concourse where
               hundreds of children are assembled, each wearing an
               identification label. The noise is overwhelming. The
               organizers shout into megaphones. One buy has fainted and
               is put on a stretcher by St. Johns Ambulance men and, to
               get through the crowd, they hold the stretcher above their
               heads. The boy recovers, sits up and waves to his friends.
               The parents throng behind the barrier and they follow him.
               WOMEN'S VOLUNTARY SERVICE (W.V.S) Volunteers stand by.

                                   W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Australia?

               GRACE nods. The W.V.S WOMAN examines the labels on SUE and
               BILL and checks them against her list. The steam ad noise
               have suffocating effect on GRACE.

                                   W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Say goodbye and pass them
                         through.

               GRACE weeps as she embraces SUE. BILL fights back the tears
               and turns away embarrassed when his mother wants a kiss
               from him.

                                   BILL
                         I'm going to miss the war and
                         it's all your fault.

               They are sucked into the enclosure and quickly disappear
               among the throng of refugee children. GRACE tries to follow
               with her eyes, searching for them hungrily. They disappear.
               MAC flinches at the pain he sees in her face. She lunges
               forward, and tries to push through the barrier.

                                   GRACE
                         I can't do it. What's the point?

                                   MAC
                         It's just the wrench, Grace. It's
                         for their sake.

               He tries to restrain her, but she breaks free.

                                   GRACE
                         Let me through, I want my
                         children.

                                   W.V.S. WOMAN
                         No one goes in there. You signed
                         the forms, didn't you?

                                   GRACE
                         Yes, I did. And now I want them
                         back.

                                   W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Too late. Plenty of others
                         would've been glad of their
                         places.

               The W.V.S. WOMAN and an ARP MAN are forcibly holding her.
               MAC cannot bear to watch her pain. He leaps over the
               barrier, grans SUE and BILL and hoists them out of the pen.
               BILL is acutely embarrassed at the scene his mother is
               making. He struggles to get free of MAC.

                                   BILL
                         Let me alone. I want to go. I
                         want to go.

               MAC swings them over to GRACE. She snatches up SUE and hugs
               her. Over the child's shoulder her eye is drawn to a poster
               depicting a ghostly Hitler hovering over a mother and her
               children. He whispers in her ear "Take them back".

                                   BILL
                         In front of everybody. They were
                         all looking at us. Why did you
                         have to do it?

               GRACE is shattered, drained. She becomes calm almost
               dreamy.

                                   GRACE
                         Please yourself.
                             (turns to Mac)
                         Let them go, if they want.

                                   MAC
                         Grace!

               GRACE turns back to the barrier, which is still defended by
               the W.V.S WOMAN with the clipboard.

                                   W.V.S. WOMAN
                         Changed your mind?

                                   GRACE
                         Yes.

                                   W.V.S WOMAN
                         Well, you're too late. Apply
                         again. On your head be it.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               BILL glues balsa wood wings on to a model Spitfire.
               Opposite him, across the dining-room table, GRACE is
               cutting something out of the newspaper. DAWN'S school books
               are spread out on the table, but she has abandoned them in
               favour of a dancing lesson by Victor Sylvester on the
               wireless. She steers her imaginary partner between the
               furniture, her face concentrates, trying to follow the
               steps.

                                   VICTOR SYLVESTER (V.O.)
                         Slow, quick, quick, slow. Right
                         forward.. left together.. Three,
                         four.. Back together.. Turn..
                         One, two.. Quick, quick, slow.

               GRACE crosses the room towards the kitchen. DAWN passes in
               from of her and she falls into step partnering her daughter
               in the dance.

                                   DAWN
                         You know it? It must be an old
                         one.

                                   GRACE
                         Ancient. Have you finished your
                         homework?

                                   DAWN
                         After this dance.

               She mouths the steps, "Forward..quick, quick, slow"



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               GRACE pins the newspaper cutting to a bulletin board which
               also displays a 'war map' with pins in it showing the
               progress of hostilities. The cutting is a David Low cartoon
               showing a soldier standing defiantly on a rocky promontory
               looking across a stormy sea towards France, saying 'Very
               well alone.' She is deeply moved by it. BILL enters and
               watches her, sensitive of her mood, but he has a mournful
               duty. He takes out the pins, representing the German Army
               in Russia.

                                   BILL
                         I've got to move the Germans to
                         Minsk. They've taken Minsk.

               GRACE lays a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                                   GRACE
                         Tomorrow. Give them one more
                         night of freedom. Move them in
                         the morning.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Swirling to the dance music, DAWN comes face to face with
               the clock on the mantelpiece and registers the hours. She
               dives for the wireless and searches for another station.
               She is satisfied when she hears the stenorian tones of Lord
               Haw-Haw's nightly propaganda broadcast from Germany.

                                   DAWN
                         Quick! Lord Haw-Haw! He's
                         starting.

               BILL scampers in. GRACE hovers by the door.

                                   LORD HAW-HAW (V.O.)
                         ..the soldiers like to wager
                         among themselves, what day will
                         the German army enter Moscow? One
                         thing is certain: much sooner
                         than anyone thought. From here in
                         Berlin, listeners in Britain, I
                         can give some very definite news.
                         There will be a bomber raid on
                         London tonight, the fourteenth
                         night in succession. Look out for
                         bombs if you live in Carshalton
                         or Croydon. There will be
                         incendiary attacks if you live in
                         Fulham and Hammersmith. And watch
                         out in Kew; be alert in
                         Walthamstow.

               BILL looks at his mother, DAWN gets up and goes over to the
               wireless, staring at it.

                                   BILL
                         That's us.

                                   GRACE
                         It's just German Propaganda.

                                   DAWN
                         He always knows.

                                   GRACE
                         Half the time he's bluffing.

               A moment of dread hangs over the room. GRACE summons her
               resolve and bustles over to the wireless and snaps it off.

                                   GRACE
                         Bill, off to bed.

               She gives him a shove towards the door to silence his
               protest. She takes DAWN by the shoulder and presses her
               into a chair and pushes her head into her homework.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sirens are sounding, one after the other, some distant,
               some close, then the one at the end of the street, like
               dogs howling in the night waking other dogs. Three German
               bombers, a Heinkel, a Dornier and a Stuka, fly in formation
               across the black sky. GRACE appears behind the model
               planes, which hang on threads from the ceiling, wakes BILL
               and SUE and they stumble out of bed.



               INT. ROHAN'S HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

               GRACE leads BILL and SUE down the stairs. They sleep on
               their feet in this familiar routine. DAWN is still dressed
               below, playing dance records on the gramophone and
               finishing homework.

                                   GRACE
                         We better go to the shelter.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               They open the French windows and fierce wind cuts into the
               room.

                                   DAWN
                         It's freezing out.

               GRACE hesitates, then closes the windows.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               They squeeze themselves into the tiny space under the
               stairs, close the door and light a candle. BILL and SUE
               complain irritably as they try to arrange their limbs. The
               shoving and pushing wakes them up.

               GRACE gives each of them a biscuit from a tin.

                                   DAWN
                         What would we do if a German came
                         into the house?

                                   GRACE
                         Don't be silly, Dawn.

                                   DAWN
                         Well, why do you always bring the
                         carving knife in here?

               DAWN picks up the knife, pretending to hear someone outside
               the cupboard door. She presses her ear to the thin wooden
               partition. BILL'S eyes bulge. He is half convinced. Even
               GRACE looks uneasy. SUE, reacting automatically to crisis,
               pulls on her red and white 'Mickey Mouse' gasmask. Suddenly
               DAWN thrusts the knife through a crack in the boards. She
               makes a blood curdling cry.

               GRACE slaps her, amused, despite herself. BILL seizes DAWN
               from behind and pulls her back on top of him. They writhe
               and giggle. BILL cocks an ear.

                                   BILL
                         Flak!

               They are stock-still, straining to hear. He is right. The
               anti-aircraft guns have started up. Their crisp 'crump'
               sound gets closer and more frequent. Another separate sound
               intrudes - falling bombs. The explosions are at regular
               intervals, each one louder than the last.

                                   BILL
                         Basket bombing
                         Counts between the bombs
                         Two and three and four and five
                         and six and..

               The next bomb falls closer.

                                   GRACE
                         Why didn't I take you to the
                         shelter?

               Her hands tough and caress the children, as though weaving
               a protective charm over them.

                                   BILL
                         ...four and five and six and...

               Another, louder still. They sit tense and straining every
               muscle, willing the bombs away.

                                   GRACE
                         If only I'd let you go to
                         Australia.

                                   BILL
                         ...and five and six and...

               It is deafening, shaking the house.

                                   DAWN
                         The next one is ours. Either it
                         hits us or it goes past us.

                                   BILL
                         ...and four and five...

                                   DAWN
                         Please God. Not on us. Drop it on
                         Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.

                                   BILL
                         ...and six...

               It drops, some way past them. They slump exhausted against
               each other. A fire-engine bell approaches. The flask goes
               on. DAWN gets up, untangles herself from the others.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm not going to die like a rat
                         in a trap. Let me out of here.

               Staggers out of the cupboard.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm going outside.

               BILL scrambles after her.

                                   GRACE
                         Wait. Don't.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

               DAWN runs out. Searchlights criss-cross the sky. Anti
               aircraft shells make little white puffs in the black sky,
               the sound coming much later. Up the road, a house is
               blazing. A fire engine swings by. ARP MEN run in the
               street. DAWN dances in the tiny front garden.

                                   DAWN
                         Quick, quick.. slow, quick, slow.

               BILL hesitates in the porch.

                                   DAWN
                         It's lovely. Lovely. Does little
                         Billy want to see the fireworks?

               BILL runs out, sees something by the kerb and picks it up.

                                   BILL
                         Shrapnel! And it's still hot.

               He tosses it from hand to hand. At the far end of the
               street, the skyline of central London is silhouetted
               against a burning sky. GRACE suddenly laughs at the sight
               of the burning house down the street. She is shocked at her
               own reaction.

                                   GRACE
                         Come in at once, or I wash my
                         hands of you.

               A shell bursts right overhead and they duck into the open
               doorway. The four of them are framed there, looking up at
               the savage sky where the Battle of Britain rages. BILL
               watches enraptured.



               EXT. THE CITY OF LONDON - NIGHT

               BLACK AND WHITE

               St. Paul's sites at the heart of the blazing city.



               EXT. STREET - DAY

               COLOUR

               DAWN, in school uniform, rides off on her bicycle. BILL and
               SUE come out with satchels and gasmasks. GRACE watches them
               making their way along the street scarred and damaged by
               the night's bombing. PEOPLE scratch in the rubble to
               salvage their belongings.

               BILL'S eyes are fixed on the ground searching from
               shrapnel. Now and then he stops to retrieve a piece. SUE
               dawdles along behind him, one foot in the gutter, the other
               on the kerb.

               BILL looks up as he hears a voice groaning from a bomb
               site. SUE is now some way ahead. The street is suddenly
               deserted. He looks back at the bomb-scarred house. The
               front of the house is gone and flowery wallpapers are
               revealed. The voice cries out again, a panting, rasping
               moan. BILL ventures forward. Now a WOMAN'S VOICE, groaning.

                                   MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh fuck... oh fuck... oh fuck...

               A white hand and forearm stretch up from the debris. BILL
               shifts position until he can SEE TWO HEADS, a MALE and
               FEMALE, pressed against a mattress which is leaning against
               a broken wall. He darts back on the street and looks for
               help. The street is still deserted. He hesitates, then runs
               up the street for all he is worth.



               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               BILL and SUE are late. They run into the yard where the
               other children are already lining up in their respective
               classes. The HEADMASTER is a wizened Welshman, too old for
               military service. He struts up and down.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Dressing from the right!

               He points an accusing finger at BILL.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Late! My study before prayers.

               They shuffle into their correct spacing.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Eyes front! Keep still down
                         there, you little ones. It's
                         discipline that wins wars.

               Inspects his troops.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Now quick march. Left... right...
                         left... right. Swing those arms.

               INT. HEADMASTER'S STUDY - DAY

               BILL flinches and winces as the cane strikes his hand.



               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

               The children are praying, eyes closed, hands joined. On the
               dais, the teachers, mostly women, are lined up.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Oh God, bring destruction to our
                         enemies. Make these young one's
                         true soldiers of the Lord. Guide
                         Mr. Churchill's hand in the
                         cunning war.

               Some of the boy's covertly swap pieces of shrapnel and
               cigarette cards as the HEADMASTER'S tirade grows in
               passion, but BILL is mesmerized and fearful of this daily
               rhetoric. He blows on his hands, shakes them to alleviate
               the pain inflicted by the caning.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Let our righteous shells smite
                         down the Messerschmitts and the
                         Fokkers.

               BILL'S face, twisted in anxious anticipation, awaits the
               next blow.



               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Lord, send troublesome dreams to
                         Herr Hitler. Let him not sleep
                         the sleep of the innocent. And
                         comfort our warriors at the
                         fronts. Brighten their swords,
                         burnish their bullets with your
                         fire.

               BILL jerks convulsively and grins as the cane connects.



               INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

               The HEADMASTER reaches a climatic peak, then is silent,
               head sinking to his chest. He continues, very quietly.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         We beseech Thee, Oh Lord, to have
                         mercy on these Thy children.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         We dedicate our studies this day
                         to the war effort.



               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               BILL covertly shows the welts on his hands to his neighbour
               as he and thirty other nice-year-old children are harangued
               by a large red-faced woman, their TEACHER. She sprays a lot
               of saliva as she speaks. A coloured linen projection of the
               world is hung over the blackboard. She slaps it with her
               cane, pointing to many countries .

                                   TEACHER
                         Pink... pink... pink... pink...
                         What are the pink bits, Rohan?

               BILL stands up, still seeking balm for his hands - he has
               them tucked under his armpits.

                                   BILL
                         They're ours, Miss.

                                   TEACHER
                         Yes, the British Empire.

               A boy, HARPER, sits in front row and is in saliva range.
               Each time the TEACHER turns back to the blackboard, the boy
               wipes his desk flamboyantly with a cloth, much to the
               spluttering amusement of his classmates.

                                   TEACHER
                         Harper, what fraction of the
                         earth's surface is British?

                                   HARPER
                         Don't know, Miss.

                                   TEACHER
                         Anyone?

               A girl shoots up her hand. JENNIFER BAKER.

                                   JENNIFER
                         Two-fifths, Miss.

                                   TEACHER
                         Yes. Two-fifths. Ours. And that's
                         what the war is all about. Men
                         are fighting and dying to save
                         the pink bits for you ungrateful
                         little twerps.

               The pinched little faces find this notion difficult to
               absorb. They stare back blankly at the British Empire. A
               SIREN SOUNDS an air raid warning.

                                   TEACHER
                         Books away! Scramble!

               They grab their gasmasks and run from the class, cheering.



               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               The children swarm to the shelters, which are long narrow
               concrete structures in sandbags to absorb blast.



               INT. SHELTERS - DAY

               The children file in mostly, laughing and chatting. There
               are clattering duckboards on the ground affording cover
               from an inch or two of water. Along each side of the
               shelters are narrow benches. The children sit facing each
               other. The HEADMASTER'S steel-studded boots hammer noisily
               down the steps. He raises his arm high.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Gasmasks on!

               They open up their cases and pull on their masks. The
               HEADMASTER conducts their breathing,. Moving his arms up
               and down to indicate a rhythm.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Slowly... in... out...don't
                         panic... in... out...

               There is a HISSING SOUND as they inhale, then a RASPING
               comic RASPBERRY as the air is pushed out of the sides of
               the rubber masks.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         In... out... These masks are
                         given to us to filter away
                         abominations of the enemy.

               He marches up and down in the narrow gap between the scabby
               knees of children.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Now, nine times table. One times
                         nine is nine...

               The  children's muffled voices chant the multiplication
               table rubbery GURGLING SOUNDS merge from the gasmasks.
               Hidden behind his mask, BILL finally gives was to angry
               tears. He sticks out his tongue as the HEADMASTER passes
               by.

                                   HEADMASTER
                         Two times nine is eighteen...

               (And so on)



               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               BILL and SUE turn into their street on their way home from
               school, looking lifeless and dull, but their faces lights
               up with excitement as the fifty-foot length of a BARRAGE
               BALLOON suddenly rises from behind the houses to the
               distant SOUND of CHILDREN CHEERING. They sprint into their
               house.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               BILL and SUE run through the hallway and into the living
               room, scattering satchels, hats, gasmasks in their wake.
               Their excitement is far too intense to explain to the
               startled GRACE. They burst out through the French Windows
               into the Garden.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               They run to the back fence. In the waste ground beyond the
               garden, where a further row of house was to be built when
               war intervened, BILL and SUE witness a TEAM of mostly
               AIRWOMEN, (WRAFS) intent on launching the BALLOON Some
               twenty WOMEN, each holding a tether, are paying out their
               lines under the rhythmic commands of their LEADER. There is
               a c able attached to the winch mounted on a TRUCK, and this
               is wound out as the balloon rises. The balloon has a
               comforting, humorous aspect, and the children laugh and
               giggle as they watch.



               NEWSREEL

               BLACK AND WHITE

               Like a school of basking whales, barrage balloons fill the
               sky. It Is a newsreel of the Battle of Britain. A dramatic
               scene follows: A DOG FIGHT between SPITFIRES and GERMAN
               BOMBERS. A patriotic, punning commentary, pulsating music.



               INT. CINEMA - DAY

               COLOUR

               GRACE and her three children are glimpsed in their seats,
               watching. BILL is totally engrossed, enthralled. Out of
               habit, he simulates the engine noise of the planes and the
               clutter of cannon fire.

               Suddenly a caption is superimposed on the screen:

               AIR RAID IN PROGRESS - YOU ARE ADVISED TO TAKE SHELTER.

               GRACE leads them out. They shuffle up the aisle, dragging
               their feet, watching over their shoulders as they go.

                                   BILL
                         Can't we just see the end?

                                   DAWN
                         They've got the real thing
                         outside.

                                   BILL
                         It's not the same.



               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               A number of PEOPLE have come out of their suburban gardens
               and look up at the pale-blue-winter sky. GRACE, SUE and
               BILL are among them.

               A SQUADRON OF SPITFIRES is attacking a formation of GERMAN
               BOMBERS. They are distant black dots high above the barrage
               balloons. The planes WHEEL and DIVE and give a splendid
               display of AEROBATICS. Being so high, there is almost no
               sound of engines or cannon and the feeling of unreality is
               heightened.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT GARDEN - DAY

               One of the GERMAN PLANES is HIT as the PILOT leaps from his
               burning plane and a PARACHUTE blossoms and checks his fall.
               GRACE draws the children back into the corner of the house
               as the PLANE CRASHES. They creep out again. The dog fight
               continues but the German planes have lost formation and
               dispersed. The battle has become straggly and is rapidly
               disappearing from view. Meanwhile, the PILOT'S PARACHUTE
               drifts ever CLOSER as he descends, causing great
               excitement.



               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               NEIGHBOURS run in the direction of the FALLING AIRMAN. Some
               WOMEN carry garden forks and others pick up rocks on the
               way. GRACE and the children hurry back into the house.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

               They go out through the back gate to join an excited throng
               of NEIGHBOURS.



               EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

               The PILOT drifts on to the wasteland where the barrage
               balloon bravely flies. People rush in from all sides, as he
               makes an elegant landing and gathers his parachute. A crowd
               of women, children and OLD MEN encircle him. He looks no
               more than twenty-years old. The crowd watches every move he
               makes. They edge back as he reaches into his pocket. But it
               is only a silk handkerchief that he pulls out. He wipes his
               hands, puts it away. He moves to an empty oil drum and sits
               on it. He crosses his legs and carefully lights a
               cigarette. His affects the greatest nonchalance as he
               smokes. A little way off a huge hoarding gives the
               impression of the houses that were to be built on this
               site, an idyll of suburban bliss. The PILOT looks at the
               idealized family group on the poster and then at GRACE and
               her children. He smiles ironically.

                                   GRACE
                         England is so beautiful, and he
                         had to land here of all places.

               Finally, a rather aged POLICE CONSTABLE arrives on the
               scene. The onlookers thrust him forward. He advances a few
               paces, the stops. Hesitating, quite at a loss. He looks at
               the PILOT then back to the crowd. They egg him on.
               Resolutely, the CONSTABLE pulls out his truncheon and steps
               forward.

                                   CONSTABLE
                         Now then. Now then.

               The German PILOT gets languidly to his feet. The POLICEMAN
               Retreats a pace. A TITTER or two ripples through the crowd.
               Encouragingly, the PILOT half raises his hands in the
               'stick-em-up' position, the cigarette held delicately
               between the pale fingers. It is a taunting but oddly gentle
               gesture. The CONSTABLE takes him by the arm and leads him
               off. The crowd opens up to let them pass. As he does, DAWN
               catches his eye and he winks at her. She gives him a
               flirtatious smile. GRACE is horrified. She seizes DAWN and
               forces her face against her own breast, hiding her gaze
               from the lewdness of the enemy.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN is bent over, looking between her legs at BILL as he
               tries to draw a stocking seam up the back of her calf. He
               must continuously lick the brown crayon. She holds a hand
               mirror in such a way that she can see the progress of his
               work.

                                   DAWN
                         It's crooked. Rub that bit out
                         and do it again.

               She cuff's him and he resumes. He stops halfway up her
               thigh.

                                   DAWN
                         Well, keep going. Don't stop now.

               He goes higher, then hesitates again.

                                   BILL
                         Nobody is going to see this far
                         up.

               She leers at him.

                                   DAWN
                         Don't be so sure.

               He blushes. She stands up and pirouettes, her flared skirt
               swings out, exposing her knickers.

                                   DAWN
                         When I jitterbug.



               INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               DAWN, swinging as she jitterbugs with a young CANADIAN
               SOLDIER, BRUCE. They are good. He hoists her over his
               shoulder. They whirl and swirl. The music changes to a slow
               waltz.

                                   BRUCE
                         It was great for me, how was it
                         for you.

                                   DAWN
                         A bit too quick.

                                   BRUCE
                         Well. Now we can do it slow. Are
                         those some kind of stockings
                         you're wearing?

                                   DAWN
                         They might be.

                                   BRUCE
                         I mean, no suspenders. They just
                         kinda' disappear up your ass.

               She slaps his face. He Holds up his hands in mock horror
               and backs away.

                                   BRUCE
                         Quit it. Help me someone. The
                         girl's beating on me.

               Jeers and laughter from fellow CANADIANS on the dance
               floor. DAWN turns and walks off, head in the air, but not
               forgetting to wriggle her bottom as she goes. BRUCE grins
               admiringly and stalks after her on tiptoe. His pals love
               it.



               EXT. SKY - DAY

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A SPITFIRE is attacked by a GERMAN PLANE. The pilot twists
               and turns away, trying to escape. The pilot is BILL! His
               eyes bulge with fear as the enemy bullets rip into his
               fuselage. The rat-a-tat of the gunfire wakes him up.



               INT. ROHAN'S HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               COLOUR

               BILL opens his eyes, and they alight upon his MODEL
               SPITFIRE suspended on a thread over his bed. The cannon
               fire gradually resolves into a TAPPING on the WINDOW.
               Blearily he gets up and unlatches it. A Dishevelled DAWN
               climbs through, threading her way between the model
               airplanes hanging from the ceiling and stepping down over
               the table on which BILL has his shrapnel collection spread.

                                   BILL
                             (whispering)
                         Mind that shrapnel

               DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.

                                   DAWN
                             (whispering)
                         I'm starting my own collection.

                                   BILL
                             (impressed)
                         It's Canadian. Where'd you get
                         it?

               She pockets it and creeps out of the door, smiling smugly.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN pulls back the covers and slides into bed, fully
               dressed. She is asleep as her head hits the pillow. A
               distant SIREN starts-up,warning of an air-raid.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - GRACE'S BEDDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE is instantly alert as the SIRENS call to one another,
               coming CLOSER. She throws on her dressing-gown, pulls on
               her fur-lined boots, picks up the ever-packed bag at her
               bedside and hurries out of the door.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE shakes BILL and SUE awake.

                                   GRACE
                         Bill, Sue. Air-raid!

               They tumble out of bed and into their dressing-gowns like
               automata.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE enters, shakes DAWN who does not respond. GRACE pulls
               back the covers and is surprised to see DAWN fully dressed,
               wearing make-up and with slightly crooked seams down the
               back of her legs.

                                   GRACE
                         Dawn, what have you been up to?

               DAWN murmurs her protest. GRACE pulls her out of bed, but
               DAWN crawls back in.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm not going to that shelter.
                         I'd sooner die.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

               BOMBS are already falling. GRACE switches on a light and
               hurries down the stairs leading her two children through
               the familiar routine. She calls back. BILL bumps down the
               stairs, on his bottom, half asleep.

                                   GRACE
                         Dawn! Come down here!

               Shew starts back up the stairs, but is halted by a BOMB
               dropping close by. She runs down again, scoops up the two
               little ones and heads from the living room.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               As they approach the French windows, another BOMB EXPLODES
               very close by.
               Before its sound is heard, there is a tremendous BLAST,
               which rips off the blackout curtains and sends them
               floating into the room. The WINDOWS are TORN OUT and most
               of the fragmented glass hangs limply from the brown paper
               that criss-crosses the panes for just this eventuality.

               Every loose object is hurled inwards. The room light
               flickers on and off and shell-bursts illuminate the room
               from without. GRACE and the children are thrown back
               against the wall, but before they hit it the process is
               reversed and the blast is sucked out again. They are pulled
               back towards the windows together with the glass and loose
               fragments of the room. This all happens slowly as though
               the room is filled with water and the windows were a
               reversible sluice gate. SUE'S long blonde-hair is first
               blown, then sucked across her face. Then comes the SOUND of
               the EXPLOSION itself, Which seems to have the effect od
               draining water from the room. The People and the bric-a
               brac all drop to the floor, dead weights once more.

               The children clutch their ears, SCREAMING. GRACE has one or
               two cuts. She gathers up the children, spreading her blood
               on them, and frightens herself, confused as to whom the
               blood belongs. She wipes it away, crying out a desperate
               prayer.

                                   GRACE
                         Please, God. Take me, but spare
                         them.

               She carries SUE and drags BILL through the shattered French
               windows, out into the garden and towards the Anderson
               shelter.



               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

               Two more BOMBS EXPLODE, further way, but still close enough
               for the blast to force them off balance. They stumble and
               fall, covering their ears against the pressure. They tumble
               into the SHELTER, stepping into several inches of water.
               The ack-ack keeps up the barrage, and the EXPLODING SHELLS
               intermittently LIGHT UP the SKY. GRACE, mumbling Dawn's
               name, clambers out of the shelter to fetch her.

               GRACE sees DAWN coming down the garden. She looks dazed as
               she staggers quite slowly with one arm wound around her
               head. As she gets closer, GRACE sees that her eyes are
               glazed and she is MOANING. GRACE leads her into the SHELTER
               and covers her with a blanket. SUE is fast asleep already
               in spite of everything. DAWN looks at her mother
               accusingly.

                                   DAWN
                         You don't care if I die. How
                         could you leave me there? Even if
                         you don't love me?

               DAWN desperately wants her mother to take her in her arms,
               but GRACE sits stiffly upright, unyielding.

                                   DAWN
                         Tell me the truth. You had to get
                         married, didn't you? Because of
                         me.

                                   GRACE
                         The ideas you get in your head.

                                   DAWN
                         That's why you never liked me.
                         I'm different from you. Well,
                         everything's different now, so it
                         doesn't matter. So there.

               Finally DAWN bends forward and puts her head on her
               mother's lap and cries, at first softly, the more bitterly.
               GRACE holds her and rocks her at last. BILL watches this,
               perplexed, as perhaps he always will be, by the complex
               emotional interplay that passes between women.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               GRACE and DAWN are cleaning up the debris. Some plaster has
               fallen and there is a pall of dust. They are singing
               merrily, glad to be alive, to have survived the night.

               Outside the front window, BILL and SUE can be seen, having
               ventured out, eager to explore the damage done to Rosehill
               Avenue.



               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               BILL picks up shrapnel. Several houses have been damaged,
               one heavily so. Outside this house, a handful of people has
               gathered watching the ARP MEN as they comb through the
               smouldering ruins. Two of them are working a stirrup pump
               as they extinguish a small fire in a corner of a room. Some
               children come up to BILL and SUE. They are flushed and
               excited, bursting with news. One buy, ROGER, blurts it out.

                                   ROGER
                         Pauline's mum got killed.

                                   BILL
                         No, she didn't.

                                   ROGER
                         Yes, she did, didn't she?

               He appeals to his companions, particularly to a GIRL, JANE,
               a little older than the others.

                                   JANE
                         Yes, she did. Killed stone dead.

                                   ROGER
                         You can ask her. Ask Pauline.

               He points over at the ruined house, and sure enough there
               is PAULINE, a girl of twelve. From time to time, a
               silicosis NEIGHBOUR goes over to her, offering help, but
               PAULINE shakes her head and looks away. She just's stands
               there as though her mother has told her to wait on that
               spot and not to talk to any strangers until she got back.
               The children drift across towards her and stop a few feet
               away. They stare intently, studying her face.

                                   ROGER
                         Isn't that right? You're mum got
                         killed last night?

               PAULINE nods affirmatively. A BOY throws a miniature
               parachute into the air. It opens up and drops neatly at
               PAULINE'S feet.

                                   ROGER
                         There you are. I told you.

               He jabs BILL in the ribs, finding a physical vent for his
               excitement. BILL lashes back at him with a violent anger
               that scares and quells the other boy. The group falls
               silent.

               PAULINE steals glances at them out of the corner of her
               eye. She is not a popular girl, careful and self-conscious,
               and she cannot help enjoying this situation. She flushes.

                                   JANE
                         Do you feel rotten, Pauline?

               PAULINE shakes her head. The children move away from her
               and start to fool around, scrapping and laughing, but when
               they get back within a certain distance of PAULINE, they
               grow quiet and move away again. BILL nudges SUE.

                                   BILL
                         Go and ask her if she wants to
                         play.

                                   SUE
                         Ask her yourself.

                                   BILL
                         You do it. You're a girl.

               SUE edges slowly towards her, not without nervous glances
               back at her brother.

                                   SUE
                         Pauline.

               PAULINE does not deign to answer the little girl.

                                   SUE
                         Pauline. Do you want some
                         shrapnel?

               She has fragments in her hand. She offers then to PAULINE.
               It is possibly part of the bomb that killed her mother.
               PAULINE shakes her head.

                                   SUE
                         Do you want to play?

               PAULINE shakes her head again. SUE goes back to BILL who
               has been watching carefully at a distance. After a moment,
               they turn back and walk home. ROGER sees another newcomer
               approaching. He calls out.

                                   ROGER
                         Hey, Terry. Pauline's mum got
                         killed last night.

                                   TERRY
                         She never.

                                   ROGER
                         She did too.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               BILL and SUE enter, bursting with their news. GRACE'S
               sister, HOPE, has come to help and so have MOLLY and MAC,
               and a Neighbour, MRS. EVANS, on whom DAWN wished a bomb.
               GRACE'S arm is bandaged, MAC is scoring panes of glass with
               a diamond cutter. He has a dollop of putty. BILL is
               immediately distracted and cannot resist kneading the
               putty. DAWN brings in a tray of tea. They are all in high
               spirits, almost festive. SUE tugs at her mother's skirt.

               SUE
                         Pauline's mummy got deaded.

               GRACE'S attention is elsewhere. She does not hear.

                                   MOLLY
                         You're lucky up here. The East
                         End's been burning for three
                         nights. Incendiaries.

               DAWN hands the neighbour her tea.

                                   DAWN
                         Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?

                                   MRS. EVANS
                         Touch wood.

                                   DAWN
                         You had a near-miss the other
                         might.

                                   MRS. EVANS
                         I hear they're dropping diseased
                         rats on bomb sites.

                                   DAWN
                         BILL found this tiny little
                         parachute. So that's what it was
                         for.

               They all slurp their tea and talk at once. HOPE is dusting
               the piano.

                                   HOPE
                         Is the piano all right, Grace? It
                         was knocked clean over.

               GRACE goes over to it and opens the lid, runs her fingers
               over the keys.

                                   GRACE
                         It seems to have survived.

                                   MAC
                         Play something, Grace.

                                   MOLLY
                         We never used to sing much before
                         the war, did we? Not in daytime
                         anyway.

               DAWN starts to sing 'Mareseatoats and Doeseaboats and
               Littleambseativy' and GRACE picks it up on the piano. DAWN
               dances around the room. There is something wild and
               abandoned about her.

                                   MRS. EVANS
                         Dawn's come on fast.

                                   MOLLY
                         That's the war for you. Quick,
                         quick, quick.

                                   MRS. EVANS
                         Didn't I see you with a soldier,
                         Dawn?

               It is just a teasing guess. She roars with laughter.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm just doing my bit for the war
                         effort.

               GRACE stops playing.

                                   GRACE
                         I won't have this vulgar talk in
                         my house.

                                   DAWN
                         It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm
                         fifteen. I'm still at school. I
                         want to be a nun when I grow up.

               MAC goes over to GRACE. He picks up some sheet music from a
               pile scattered on the floor. He selects a piece and props
               it on the music stand.

                                   MAC
                         Try and few bars of old Fred,
                         Grace.

               GRACE is softened by his tone. Their eyes meet for a
               moment. She turns the stool back to the keyboard and plays
               Chopin, particularly poignant since the fall of Warsaw.
               They listen with teary eyes. 'Mareseatoats and Doeseaboats 
               and Chopin. It is the spirit of the Blitz.

                                   SUE
                             (whispering to Bill)
                         Tell them about Pauline's mum.

                                   BILL
                         Not now. They wouldn't believe
                         me.

               STOCK FILM

               BLACK AND WHITE

               The Chopin continues over a scenes of bomb-ruined London,
               desolate and devastated.



               EXT. BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               COLOUR

               A surreal landscape: a flight of stairs leading nowhere, an
               exposed bathroom; a house entirely destroyed but for one
               fragment of wall jutting up, and on it still hangs a
               picture. BILL wanders among these wonders, scavenging. A
               marauding gang of boys approaches. They spread out and move
               up on BILL from all sides, trapping him. ROGER, the boy who
               told of Pauline's mother's death, is among them and appears
               to be their leader.

                                   ROGER
                         What are you doing here? This is
                         our territory

                                   BILL
                         Looking for shrapnel.

                                   A BOY
                         What you got?

               Two of them grab BILL and wrench his fist open, extracting
               a piece of metal.

                                   A BOY
                         Look, a detonator.

               The others gather round, scrapping and shoving for a better
               look, BILL'S arms are twisted behind his back and his eyes
               are covered with a very dirty handkerchief. They take him
               to a ruined house.



               INT. RUINED HOUSE - DAY

               The room has a brazier, table and chairs. They remove the
               blindfold and he sees a wondrous sight, a collection of
               bullets, shells and bomb fragments. ROGER slaps the shell
               proudly.

                                   ROGER
                         Unexploded.

                                   BOY
                         You were spying.

                                   BILL
                         I never was.

                                   ROGER
                         Yes, you was. Make him talk.

               They twist his arm. Several of the boys are smoking. One
               takes a .303 Bullet and tightens in into an old vice fixed
               to the table. BILL is fighting back the tears. ROGER leans
               over BILL.

                                   BILL
                         I know a secret.

                                   ROGER
                         What's that?

                                   BILL
                         The Germans are dropping men on
                         bomb sites.

                                   ROGER
                         Who told you that?

               They loosen their grip on his arm.

                                   BILL
                         My uncle's in the War Office. He
                         said, Don't go on the bomb sites.
                         "Boys are going missing all the
                         time."

                                   ROGER
                         They're not.

               BILL has captured their attention. They release him.

                                   BILL
                         If you find them hiding, they cut
                         your throat. They have to, or
                         they'd get found out.

               The boys begin to get nervous, glancing about them. The BOY
               on the vice aims a nail at the top of the bullet,
               brandishing a hammer in the other hand.

                                   BOY
                         I wish one would come through the
                         door now.

               He hammers the nail and the bullet EXPLODES, embedding
               itself in the door. They jump out of their skins.

                                   ROGER
                         You want to join our gang?

                                   BILL
                         I don't mind.

                                   ROGER
                         Do you know any swear words?

                                   BILL
                         Yes.

                                   ROGER
                         Say them.

               BILL is stubbornly silent.

                                   ROGER
                         Well go on then. You can't join
                         if you can't answer.

                                   BILL
                         I only know one.

               They laugh derisively.

                                   ROGER
                         Well say that one then.

               BILL cannot get himself to say it, try as he will. They
               groan and jeer. BILL forces it out, the one that he heard
               on the bomb site.

                                   BILL
                         Fuck!

               They fall respectfully silent, exchange covert looks.

                                   ROGER
                         That word is special. That word
                         is only for something really
                         important. Now, repeat after
                         me... Bugger off.

                                   BILL
                         Bugger off.

                                   ROGER
                         Sod.

                                   BILL
                         Sod.

                                   ROGER
                         Bloody.

                                   BILL
                         Bloody.

                                   ROGER
                         Now put them together. Bugger
                         off, you bloody sod.

                                   BILL
                         Bugger off, you bloody sod.

                                   ROGER
                         OK. You're in.

               He gets up, leading them out of the room.

                                   ROGER
                         Let's smash things up.

               They go into a newly bombed house and, armed with stout
               sticks and iron bars, indulge in an orgy of destruction.
               ROGER has an air-gun and specializes in picking of light
               bulbs. BILL is tentative at first, but the violence is
               infectious. Pent-up aggression bursts and his is wilder and
               worse than the others.



               EXT. BUILDER'S YARD - DAY

               ROGER leads the way, clambering over a damaged wall and
               dropping into an enclosed yard. The others tumble after him
               and ROGER raises a warning arm and addresses the gang
               solemnly.

                                   ROGER
                         This is top secret.

               He points to a corner where dozens of sign-posts, uprooted
               from crossroads, have been piled against each other, their
               arms spread out forlonly announcing the names of towns and
               their distances.

                                   ROGER
                         They pulled them up from all the
                         crossroads, so when the Germans
                         land they'll lose their way.

                                   BILL
                         Won't they have maps?

                                   ROGER
                         They'll have to go to a shop to
                         buy a map, stupid. Then they'll
                         give zemselves avay viz ze vay
                         zay tork.

               One BOY starts to goose-step and sing.

                                   BOY
                             (singing)
                         Ven der Fuhrer says
                         Vis iss der master race,
                         Ve vart, vart, vart,
                         Right in der Fuhrer's face.



               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LANDING AD STAIRS - NIGHT

               DAWN, watched by BILL, tiptoes down the stairs. She opens
               the front door as silently as possible. Vera Lynn dispenses
               sexy sentimentality on the wireless ('Sincerely Yours').
               GRACE appears. DAWN is caught in the act.

                                   GRACE
                         And where do you think you're
                         going?

                                   DAWN
                         Out.

                                   GRACE
                         You go to bed this minute and
                         take off that lipstick.

                                   DAWN
                         No, I won't.

               GRACE files at her, enraged, and slaps her head and face.

                                   GRACE
                         You wouldn't dare defy me if your
                         father was here.

               DAWN covers her head with her arms until GRACE stops,
               exhausted.

                                   DAWN
                         If you've finished, I'm going.

               She steps out of the door. GRACE grabs her, tearing her
               blouse, and swings her back inside. They wrestle wildly,
               both whimpering and moaning. BILL watches from above as the
               fight imperceptibly transforms and mother and daughter are
               finally hugging each other and crying.

                                   DAWN
                         I want him. I want him so much.
                         I'll kill myself if I can't have
                         him.

                                   GRACE
                         There, there, my baby.

               GRACE lets go and turns towards the living room where Vera
               Lynn wails a lament.

                                   GRACE
                         Go if you want. What does it
                         matter? We might be all dead
                         tomorrow.

               DAWN'S make-up is smudged, her clothes torn.

                                   DAWN
                         I can't go like this.

               GRACE turns back and takes DAWN'S hand.

                                   GRACE
                         You better bring him home, if you
                         really love him. Don't kill love.
                         You'll regret it for the rest of
                         your life.

                                   DAWN
                         Who said anything about love?

               EXT. BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               The gang's H.Q. is even further improved. They have put in
               some expensive furniture.
               They have a wireless and a cocktail bar that opens to reveal
               a nest of mirrors reflecting the bottles within. The gang
               fool's around, in and out of the room, smoking and drinking
               beer. A girl walks past, throwing them a flirtatious look. It
               is PAULINE the girl who lost her mother in an air-raid. They 
               whistle and shout at her.

                                   BOY #1
                         Want to see our den?

                                   BOY #2
                         We got a bed.

               They laugh bawdily and she turns up her nose. One of the boys
               starts to wrestle with her. She starts to struggle. They pin
               back her arms and try and kiss her. Her breasts push up
               against her blouse like little apples. ROGER whispers
               something in her ear. She protests.

                                   ROGER
                         Go on, Pauline. Be a sport.

                                   PAULINE
                         No, I won't. There's too many of
                         you.

                                   ROGER
                         One at a time.

                                   PAULINE
                         No, I won't.

                                   ROGER
                         I'll give you something.

               He gets a box, opens it and shows it her. It is full of
               looted jewelry, brooches, cheap bracelets. PAULINE is
               delighted. She pokes around and chooses a necklace, puts it
               on.

                                   PAULINE
                         All right. Line up.

               They form a n orderly queue and PAULINE pulls up her skirt.
               She holds her knickers open by the elastic so that it is
               possible to look inside. The boys file past, each peering
               inside her knickers for a second or two.

                                   BOY 2
                         I seen better.

               BILL is on the end. As his turn approaches, his face is tense
               with apprehension.

                                   PAULINE
                         It won't bite you.

               They all laugh at his expense. Hi swings punches, flying in
               all directions and they hits back. One or two land. They hurt
               the recipients and they hit back. ROGER calls a halt.

                                   ROGER
                         Pack it in. It's time to smash
                         things up.

               EXT. ANOTHER BOMBED SITE - EVENING

               The gang loot and pillage, smashing as they go. Behind a
               piece of broken wall, BILL discovers a soldier and a girl
               clasped together, the girl is pressed against a door. BILL
               moves closer. The soldier fumbles with her clothing, but she
               is so wild with passion that his efforts are impeded. BILL
               registers the familiar gasps and cries that he is becoming
               accustomed to hearing from the injured, the dying and the
               coupling. The girl moves her head and her face becomes
               visible over the soldier's shoulder. It is DAWN. She sees
               BILL as he sees her. She mouths the words: 'Go away'. He
               turns to shake and cry. He moves away, then on an angry
               impulse picks up a stone and throws it. The soldier lets out
               a cry. He turns revealing himself as BRUCE.

                                   BILL
                             (shouting)
                         Fuck!

               Hearing the sacred cry, the gang come running. They see BILL
               hurling stones and quickly join in. BRUCE protests angrily
               and throws a couple of rocks himself, but he is overwhelmed.
               He protects DAWN from the onslaught and they flee.

                                   ROGER
                         Teach him a lesson. Think they can
                         come over here and take our women.

                                   BOY 2
                         Wasn't that your sister, Rohan?

               BILL shakes his head, denying her.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               GRACE is cutting down a coat for SUE; BILL is reading a
               comic, the Dandy; DAWN is darning stockings. The doorbell
               SOUNDS and DAWN catapults from her chair to greet the
               visitor. She returns with BRUCE, now evidently a welcome and
               regular guest.

               BILL throws friendly punches, one wild one catches him in the
               crotch. He takes it bravely. He distributes largesse, a tin
               of corned beef and a packet of tea for GRACE, chewing gum for
               SUE, a model barrage balloon for BILL and a pair of nylons
               for DAWN.

                                   BRUCE
                         You need suspenders for this kind.

               She laughs, then holds the stockings against her skin in a
               transport of sexual delight.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm going to cross my legs and make
                         that rustling noise.

               Finally and dramatically, BRUCE pulls out a package in a
               brown-paper bag. He gives it to GRACE. She opens it. It is a
               piece of beef steak. GRACE is overcome.

                                   GRACE
                         Steak! I can't remember the last
                         time...

                                   BRUCE
                         crooning ironically

               'The last time I saw sirloin...'

               GRACE holds the raw meat in her two hands and impulsively
               kisses it.

                                   BRUCE
                         Take it away. I know your husband's
                         been away a long time, but....

                                   DAWN
                         Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.

               He holds up his hands in supplication.

                                   BRUCE
                         Sorry, sorry. Too long in the
                         barrack room.

               Itma has just ended and a programme has started up about the
               evacuation of Dunkirk. Its tone is quasi-religious -
               patriotic as it tells of the armada of little boats
               heroically snatching the remnants of the British Army out of
               the jaws of the Nazis. Churchill's voice booms out of the
               wireless.

                                   CHURCHILL (V.0.)
                         If the British Empire lasts for a
                         thousand years, men will say, this
                         was their finest hour.

               BRUCE has been horsing around with BILL, and all the time
               DAWN devours him with her eyes.

                                   GRACE
                         Oh, do let's listen to this. I
                         never tire of listening to it. I
                         gives me goose pimples.

                                   BRUCE
                         You haven't been taking your orange
                         juice.

               The insolent sally gives DAWN the excuse to jump on him and
               force him on to the sofa and into a respectful silence.
               Stirring music punctuates the dramatic narration, which
               celebrates the bravery of the soldiers fighting their last
               ditch stand. BRUCE giggles.

                                   BRUCE
                         Don't sound the Dunkirk I was at. I
                         saw no fighting. We did a lot of
                         running backwards, though. Then we
                         got to the beach and we couldn't
                         run no more. And Jerry just sat
                         there and let us alone. If he'd
                         come after us, boy

               shakes his head and laughs as though it would have been the
               funniest moment of the war.

               We were beat so bad, discipline was all to Hell. We told the
               soldiers to jump in the briny. There was no grub but we broke
               into the wine stores, and everybody got smashed. When the
               boats came, a lot of guys threw away their gear and filled
               their kitbags with loot. One buddy of mine burst into a
               jeweler's, his backpack was full of gold and silver. We had
               to wade out to the boats and he was so heavy he couldn't haul
               himself up. He slipped and sank like a stone.

               He laughs again. The broadcast comes to its moving climax.

                                   GRACE
                         How can you say such things? Can't
                         you hear what happened?

                                   BRUCE
                         I was there.

                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         God laid his hand upon the waters
                         and they were still. The armada of
                         little boats brought their precious
                         cargo into safe havens. They lived
                         to fight another day.

                                   BRUCE
                         He who turns and runs away lives to
                         fight another day.

               The inspiring, patriotic music, Elgar, wells up.

                                   GRACE
                         I don't care what you say. It
                         filled our hearts that day. The
                         little people stood up for once
                         against the tyrant. Stood up and
                         said no!

               BRUCE impressed, despite himself. DAWN is quite affected too,
               by her mother's deep feeling.

                                   GRACE
                         That's how we put up with the
                         bombing and the rationing, because
                         of Dunkirk. Because of the spirit
                         of Dunkirk, and because of that we
                         shall never give in, never.

               The Elgar continues into:

               NEWSREEL

               BACK AND WHITE

               A shot of troops being ferried from Dunkirk beaches by the
               little boats. An open fishing boat is packed with soldiers,
               mostly standing, while two men row. The soldiers begin to
               sway and 'la-la' to the Elgar soundtrack. They are serious
               and sombre, except for one, BRUCE, who is grinning.

               CLIVE, leather helmet and goggles iced up, rides to the Rohan
               House on a Norton motorbike. The street is snow-covered and
               the road is covered in brown slush. BILL and SUE run out to
               greet him. He dismounts painfully, his huge army greatcoat is
               also rimmed with frost. His face is so stiff with cold that
               he cannot crack a smile and presents an intimidating figure
               to the children, who draw up  short. When he speaks, he can
               hardly form words. He staggers alarmingly from the stiffness
               as he walks, and cramp in one leg makes him hop up and down.

                                   CLIVE

                         got a thirty-six hour pass.

               He holds out his arms. They cower back, then turn on their
               heels and scurry into the house,  calling their mother.

               CLIVE has changed into civvies and is soaking his feet in a
               bowl of hot water. Tea has been laid and the family
               assembled. They watch CLIVE warily. They have learned to live
               without him and his reappearance has upset the new ballance.

                                   CLIVE
                         Hand me my backpack, Bill.

               BILL hands it to him and CLIVE proudly pulls out an un
               labelled can and plants it firmly on the centre of tea table.

                                   GRACE
                         And what's that?

                                   CLIVE
                         Jam.

               BILL and SUE jump for joy.

                                   BILL AND SUE
                             (chanting)
                         Jam! Jam! Jam!

                                   GRACE
                         Jam? What kind of jam? It's not
                         like any jam I know.

                                   CLIVE
                         German jam. It's German jam.

               The table falls deathly silent. They stare at the can as
               though it was a time bomb.

                                   CLIVE
                         It's all right. It came from a
                         German chip. It got sunk, and this
                         stuff washed ashore, crates of it.
                         Jam. Our fellows found it on the
                         beach, by the rifle range.

               GRACE picks it up gingerly, turns it, searches the blank
               silver-grey metal for a sign, a clue, a portent.

                                   GRACE
                         We don't know anything about it

                                   CLIVE
                         Well, it's off ration. We know
                         that.

                                   GRACE
                         How do we know they didn't plant it
                         there? They know we're mad on jam.
                         They could poison half the country.

               CLIVE surveys the suspicious hostile faces. Angrily, he
               seizes the can and jabs it clumsily with the paper opener.

                                   GRACE
                         Come away, children. I don't want
                         you to stand too close while he's
                         opening it.

               They retreat to the corner of the room. CLIVE has it opened
               and bends back the top to reveal a deep-red jam. GRACE
               ventures forward and peers at it.

                                   CLIVE
                         Well?

                                   GRACE
                         It looks....foreign.

                                   CLIVE
                         Jam is jam! It's just jam!

                                   DAWN
                         Well, I'm not having any. Even if
                         it's not poisoned. I don't think
                         it's right. It's not patriotic.

                                   BILL
                         You don't like jam. You hate jam.
                         You never eat jam.

                                   DAWN
                         That's not the point.

               There is an impasse. They stare at it gloomily. CLIVE waves
               grandly at the jam.

                                   CLIVE
                         Taste it. Why don't you taste it?

                                   GRACE
                         You taste it.

               The eyes turn on CLIVE. The situation forces their resentment
               for one who has not shared in their hardships, who abandoned
               them, in fact. The jam has become a test. He looks into the
               faces of his family. Resolutely, he takes up a teaspoon,
               picks up the can and begins to eat. Grimly and steadily he
               ladles the jam to his mouth. They watch him carefully for
               signs of pain. Before their doubts are dispelled, he has
               consumed a third of the can. BILL is the first to crack.

                                   BILL
                         Give us some, Dad.

               CLIVE stops eating, puts the can back on the table and they
               all dig in. The tension is dispelled. SUE climbs on CLIVE'S
               lap and he feeds her himself. They laugh and chatter and
               stuff bread and jam in their mouths.

                                   GRACE
                         You mean they let you go through
                         the officer training course and
                         then said you were too old for a
                         commission?

                                   CLIVE
                         That's it.

                                   GRACE
                         Why didn't they say that before you
                         started?

                                   CLIVE
                         I wasn't too old when I started the
                         course. I was too old when it
                         finished.

                                   GRACE
                         What are you going to be then?

                                   CLIVE
                         A clerk. I'm doing a typing course.
                         I'll be typing for England.

               GRACE goes to him, puts an arm around him.

                                   GRACE
                         Poor Clive. You wanted it so much.

               He looks up at her, beaten, uncomprehending. She kisses him.

                                   GRACE
                         You're such a baby.

               The DOORBELL SOUNDS. DAWN scoots out to answer it.

                                   BILL
                         It's lovely jam. It's nearly as
                         nice as English jam.

               CLIVE grins, quickly recovered from his bad moment.

                                   CLIVE
                         You know what I always say? Jam is
                         jam, the world over.

               DAWN reappears with BRUCE. CLIVE darts a querying look at
               GRACE. He winces at the sight of his little girl looking up
               adorningly at a Canadian soldier.

                                   DAWN
                         Bruce, this is my father. Dad, this
                         is Corporal Bruce Carey.

               CLIVE laughs awkwardly, outranked.

                                   BILL
                         Bruce, look! Dad got some German
                         jam.

                                   SUE
                         We thought it was poison.

               They laugh. BRUCE looks at it with mock suspicion, then
               tastes it with his fingertip. His eyes bulge and he clutches
               his throat.

                                   BRUCE
                         The poison was at the bottom.

               He falls to the ground in the most agonized convulsions. The
               children scream with laughter and jump on top of him.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN STEPS - DAY

               The kitchen door is open, admitting thin winter sunlight.
               GRACE works within. Outside, CLIVE is cleaning his kit,
               helped by BILL. Belt and gaiters are balanced and laid out to
               dry. CLIVE is sitting on the steps, putting dubbin on his
               boots,  BILL polishing his father's hat badge, totally
               absorbed in its beauty. GRACE appears, outs a hand on CLIVE'S
               shoulder, closes her eyes, let's the sun caress her face.

                                   GRACE
                         When do you think you'll get leave
                         again?

                                   CLIVE
                         Not till Christmas, I don't
                         suppose.

               SUE appears and sprawls herself across her father's lap.

                                   CLIVE
                         I'm glad you didn't send them to
                         your aunt.

                                   GRACE
                         I've had a letter from her. They've
                         moved house.

                                   CLIVE
                         Where to?

               She smiles, eyes still closed.

                                   GRACE
                         Woolamaloo.

               CLIVE splutters with amusement.

                                   CLIVE
                         Not Woolamaloo?

               BILL looks up, grinning.

                                   BILL
                         Woolamaloo? We would have lived in
                         Woolamaloo?

               CLIVE starts to sing the old music-hall song.

                                   CLIVE
                             (singing)
                         W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, oo.
                         Upon my word, it's true.
                         It's the way to spell
                         Woolamaloo.

               They join in, in a ragged way, knowing it well.

                                   EVERYBODY
                             (singing)
                         I bet you a dollar,
                         There isn't a scholar,
                         To spell it right first go, O,
                         W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, Loo-O

               DAWN comes through the kitchen with MAC and MOLLY, who find
               the Rohans in good spirits. There are arm greetings all
               round.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               BILL is giving his father and MAC a tour of the bomb damage.
               He picks his way expertly through the rubble, and they
               clamber after him.

                                   CLIVE
                         What kind of war is this Mac? Up
                         there in Cumberland, we never see
                         an air-raid. The worst problem I
                         have is getting a new typewriter
                         ribbon. When I rode in against the
                         Turks, I knew what it was about.

                                   MAC
                         Did you? You thought you did. We've
                         been gypsed, all our lives. Look at
                         your street.

               They pause, looking out of a shattered window on the street.
               It is a monotonous row of semi-detached houses, lying between
               other identical rows, now pocked with bomb damage, drab and
               dreary.

                                   CLIVE
                         What about it?

                                   MAC
                         Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill.
                         And it's certainly not an avenue.

                                   CLIVE
                         Why not?

                                   MAC
                         You need trees for an avenue.

                                   CLIVE
                         There was talk of planting some
                         when we first came.

                                   MAC
                         Propaganda. We've been had.

               They fall silent, watching BILL as he greets some other boys.

                                   CLIVE
                         How's your war, Mac?

                                   MAC
                         Never done better. On the fiddle.
                         Like everyone else.

                                   CLIVE
                         Except the servicemen.

                                   MAC
                         Naturally.

                                   CLIVE
                         I don't understand. Is there any
                         point to it?

                                   MAC
                         There is all right. This Hitter
                         fellow. We've got to winkle him
                         out. And get shot of some of our
                         lot at the same time.

               They watch BILL rooting about in the rubble.

                                   CLIVE
                         Look at how wild the boy's got. As
                         for Dawn. Sixteen, going around
                         with a soldier.
                             (shakes his head)
                         Keep and eye on them for me, Mac,
                         there's a pal. I've made a mess
                         of it all.
                             (his voices cracks. A
                              sob wells up.)
                         I've been such a bloody fool.

               BILL has come up behind them and watches covertly. MAC clasps
               CLIVE in his arms.

                                   MAC
                         You always were, Clive. Steady the
                         Buffs.

                                   CLIVE
                         Bugger the Buffs.

               Cries and shouts come from the street. BILL swings across a
               crater on a dangling electric cable and scrambles into the
               road. There is panic and pandemonium. The local barrage
               balloon's fins have punctured and it has lost stability. It
               is careering wildly like a kite out of control. CLIVE and MAC
               clamber into the street as the balloon skims across the sky,
               its steel cable shearing a chimney stack which tumbles down
               onto the front garden sending people scattering in all
               directions. BILL runs up,  mad with excitement, as SUE and
               DAWN come out of the house with GRACE and MOLLY and look up.
               CLIVE sprints across to them.

                                   CLIVE
                         Take cover! We're being attacked by
                         our own balloons!

               They take no notice of his entreaty, curiosity getting the
               better of them.

                                   MOLLY
                         It's having a nervous breakdown.

               She giggles. The balloon bumps on the rooftop then shoots up
               into the sky again. GRACE starts to laugh.

                                   GRACE
                         It's so wonderful.

               CLIVE earnestly dashes back and forth, wanting to do
               something, but completely unable to decide what.

                                   CLIVE
                         Don't panic!
                             (goes over to Mac)
                         Keep your head!

                                   MAC
                         I will if you will!

               The balloon does a fat little waltz in the sky. CLIVE
               suddenly explodes with laughter. DAWN has SUE in her arms.

                                   DAWN
                         He just got fed up with all the
                         other boring old barrage balloons
                         and decided it was time to have
                         some fun.

               Two ARP MEN run down the street, urging people to go inside.
               The family retreat grudgingly towards their house, but hover
               in the front garden watching and laughing. Six HOME GUARDS
               march into Rosehill Avenue at the double. The balloon has
               risen into the sky and the people are drawn out again into
               the street, looking up. The HOME GUARDS come to a halt and
               raise their rifles.

                                   BILL
                         Boo! Leave it alone!

               The balloon suddenly plunges down towards the street,
               scattering the HOME GUARDS. Women SCREAM and everyone dashes
               for cover again. BILL laughs derisively.

                                   BILL
                         They're scared of old fatty.

               The GUARDS form up again and fire at the balloon. It bursts
               into flames. The shreds of burning cloth, followed by the
               spiralling cable, plunges into the street. There are cries if
               regret and the family and others step forward to inspect the
               smouldering remains with the same sadness that is felt at the
               end of a firework display.

                                   BILL
                         Why did they have to go and do
                         that?

               INT. W.V.S CENTRE - DAY

               A make-do-and-mend session, where clothes are exchanged,
               repaired, altered and cut down. It is swarming with women and
               children. MOLLY and GRACE rummage among the racks of
               clothing. SUE and BILL, bored and resigned, are obliged to
               try on items of used clothing.

                                   MOLLY
                         God, how I hate all this scrimping
                         and squalor.

                                   GRACE
                         I don't mind it. It was harder
                         before the war. Trying to keep up
                         appearances. Now it's patriotic to
                         be poor.

               In the absence of men, women are everywhere stripping down to
               their underwear to try on the clothes. BILL tries not to
               watch, acutely embarrassed.

                                   MOLLY
                         I don't know how you cope, Grace.
                         Three kids, army pay. On your own.

                                   GRACE
                         You know something, Molly? I like
                         it on my own. I never got used to
                         sharing a bed, not really.

               MOLLY pulls of her dress and suddenly, inches from BILL'S
               face, are those mysterious few inches of white suspendered
               leg between the stocking-tops and the camiknickers.

                                   MOLLY
                         I love a man in bed, the smell of
                         him, the hairiness rubbing against
                         you, the weight of him. And when
                         they do it to you in the middle of
                         the night and you don't know if
                         you're dreaming or it's really
                         happening to you. That's the best.
                         No guilty feelings. Not that I
                         should have any, wide awake.

               MOLLY pulls on a flowered silk dress that clings to her
               figure. She smooths it out.

                                   GRACE
                         Molly!

                                   MOLLY
                         Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He
                         hasn't toughed me for ages. And not
                         often ever. My life started when
                         Mac went on nights.

               She dissolves in a fit of giggles. GRACE helps SUE with a
               sensible navy-blue coat. It is heavy and dull. SUE doesn't
               like it. Her face creases and tears well up.

                                   GRACE
                         You're having me on, Molly.

                                   MOLLY
                         Am I? Maybe I am.

                                   GRACE
                         You've been drinking. Your tipsy.

                                   MOLLY
                         Tipsy, topsy, turvy.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE each have a torch, which serve as a searchlight.
               BILL smokes a woodbine and he blows the smoke around the
               suspended model aircraft.
               Spitfires, Hurricanes, Messerschmitts, Heinkels are picked
               out in turn. As they appear,BILL simulates their engine
               noise. With considerable dexterity, he uses his free hand to
               fire his ack-ack guns, and papier-mache pellets, pre-soaked
               in ink, fly through the air. BILL animates a distressed plane
               plummeting to earth. His triumph is interrupted by a TAP at
               the window. Expertly he dogs his Woodbine then goes to the
               window. He opens it and DAWN steps through. He is about to
               close it after her when BRUCE'S face appears. BILL lets fly
               an ink pellet catching BRUCE square on the forehead. DAWN
               holds up a threatening hand and the children shrink back as
               BRUCE clambers in. The two of them tiptoe into the next
               bedroom, DAWN throwing a warning glance over her shoulder.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT

               BILL and SUE share the keyhole, which affords a partial view
               of Dawn's bed. Complicated combinations of limbs cross the
               field of view, offering a tantalizing version of events
               within. The children give up and return to their room,
               whispering.

                                   SUE
                         I suppose they're still learning,
                         that's why they keep moving about.

                                   BILL
                         It's easy. I've done it.

                                   SUE
                         Who with?

                                   BILL
                         Pauline.

                                   SUE
                         Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy
                         moves on top of her. That's what
                         they do when they know how.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S ROOM - NIGHT.

               BRUCE turns on his back with a deep sigh of satisfaction.

                                   BRUCE
                             (whispering)
                         Boy, that was some air-raid.

                                   DAWN
                         Air-raid?

                                   BRUCE
                         Didn't you feel the house rock? You
                         must have seen all those shell
                         bursts.

               She sticks the pillow in her mouth to stop laughing. BRUCE
               turns and whispers in her ear.

                                   BRUCE
                         Let's get married. We'll live in
                         Montreal. I'll teach you French. Je
                         t'aime, mon petit chou.

               Even when he's serious, his manner is teasing.

                                   DAWN
                         Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil it.

               She is genuinely irritated.

               FILM EXTRACT

               BLACK AND WHITE

               A scene from a forties romantic movie. The couple on the
               screen are deeply in love, but he must go off to the war.
               Their parting is bitter-sweet, prolonged and accompanied by a
               symphony orchestra playing its heart out.

               EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

               COLOUR

               MAC sits between MOLLY and GRACE. He looks from one to the
               other. They are both weeping,

               lost in the movie, and oblivious of him. SUE sleeps, lying
               across her mother's lap. BILL squirms with embarrassment as
               the screen lovers kiss. He turns his face away. When he looks
               back, he is disgusted to see that they are still at it.

               EXT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL leans over to the balustrade of the pillar portico
               looking out on to Trafalgar Square. The strains of  a
               passionate piano recital reverberate from inside the Gallery.
               Soldiers and their girls, hand in hand, listen enraptured.

               EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - DAY

               Barrage balloons hang over Admiralty Arch and garland Nelson
               astride his column.

               EXT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL threads his way through the crowd, past signs announcing
               Dame Myra Hess's lunchtime concerts (SOLD OUT) and into the
               marbled hall.

               INT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

               BILL slides back into his seat next to GRACE as DAME Myra
               concludes the WARSAW Concerto. The audience rises to its
               feet, applauding, GRACE, he eyes shining, is among them. MAC
               watches her pleasure with pleasure.
               BILL is disturbed by the music, by the eruption of emotion
               and some wearing blue uniforms demoting the war wounded. They
               clap and clap.

                                   GRACE
                         Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't
                         been to a concert since...

                                   MAC
                         ...since I used to take you to the
                         Proms?

                                   GRACE
                         That's right. Not since then Not
                         since I got married.

               Their eyes meet. The audience is drowning in it own applause.
               Everyone is crying, or laughing, or both. GRACE and MAC among
               them. In the emotional tumult they reveal more than they
               intend. The audience falls silent. BILL'S gaze drifts to the
               wall where huge paintings by special war artists hang. GRACE
               tears her eyes away from MAC. She senses BILL watching her
               and turns her attention to Dame Myra's fingers flying over
               the keys.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The table has been stretched to embrace the Rohan family,
               including GRACE'S SISTERS. They wear paper hats, have
               finished their Christmas dinner, and are listening
               attentively to King George VI stuttering painfully through
               his Christmas message.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               It is raining. BRUCE hurries along the street, and as he
               enters the Rohan's front gate, he pauses, pulls an old silk
               stocking over his head and takes two glass eyes from his
               pocket. They look as though they once belonged to a stuffed
               stag. He pushes them inside the stocking and positions them
               just under his own eyes so that he can peek over them. He
               crawls under the bow window.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The King falters to a conclusion.

                                   CLIVE
                         He was a lot better this year.

               MAC and the others mumble agreement.

                                   BILL
                         You said that last year, Dad.

                                   CLIVE
                         The land and the King are one, my
                         son. If he stutters we falter. He's
                         getting batter, and so are we.

               The National Anthem strikes up on the wireless. They all rise
               and stand to attention.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               BRUCE raises his head and presses his grotesque face to the
               window. He taps on the glass. He is startled to see the
               assembled family standing upright and staring back at him
               without expression. He cavorts and waves his arms, but still
               gets no response. Sheepishly, he slinks into the porch and
               pulls off the stocking. The door opens to reveal DAWN.

                                   DAWN
                         Dad's furious. It was 'God Save The
                         King'.

               He goes inside and she closes the door. He pushes the stag's
               eyes into his own sockets and scrunches up his face to grip
               them into place. DAWN turns back and he lunges, trying to
               kiss her. She squeals wit laughter.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               A charade is in progress. CLIVE and MAC are got up as
               prostitutes, wearing their wives'  clothes. GRACE and MOLLY
               are dressed as men. There is a lot of salacious flirting and
               an argument breaks out over the price of whores. MOLLY says
               the word 'tart' emphatically and BILL jumps out of his seat,
               yelling:

                                   BILL
                         Jam tart! Jam tart! I got it! I got
                         it!

               The four actors abandon their characterizations and applaud
               young BILL. BRUCE watches in amazement.

                                   BRUCE
                         Jesus Christ! This is Christmas?

               GRACE'S father rises, his glass held aloft.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         The for my annual toast. Charge
                         your glasses.

               There are groans and mutterings of disapproval. He cuts an
               impressive figure,white hair, drooping moustache, waistcoat
               and watch-chain. His eyes take on a faraway look, sombre and
               serious. His wife, pointedly leaves the room, slamming the
               door behind her.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         To Mary McDonald, Thelma
                         Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily
                         Sanderson...
                             (savours each name,
                              smiles, shakes is head,
                              has a special emphasis
                              or tone of voice for
                              every one of them.)
                         ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now
                         there was a spirit. And Marjorie
                         Anderson.

                                   GRACE
                         Father, that's enough now

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         And...and...Henry Chapman's girl,
                         was it Thelma? No, I can see those
                         cornflower eyes...I've lost your
                         name, my sweetness.

               Tears come to his eyes. He falters. There are cries of
               'shame'. HOPE, GRACE'S sister, jumps to her feet.

                                   HOPE
                         Do we have to listen to this
                         nonsense every year? You're drunk,
                         Dadda. Sit down.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         ...Betty Browning...Betty, let me
                         tell you something. I'm seventy
                         three years old, I've seen half the
                         wonders of the world and I never
                         laid eyes on a finer sight than the
                         curve of Betty Browning's
                         breasts...

               raises his glass again

               My girls Dead you may be, or old and withered. But while I
               live, I will do you honour to the last. Bless all of you.

               He drinks and slumps down into his chair, overcome with
               melancholy. Only MOLLY applauds and only DAWN looks
               sympathetic. BILL taps his grandfather's knee.

                                   BILL
                         It was Sheila, Grandpa.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE looks up  sadly.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                   BILL
                         Henry Chapman's daughter. It was
                         Sheila. I remember her from last
                         year.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         So it was. Sheila. This boy will go
                         far.

               BILL turns away to DAWN, stifling his giggles.

                                   BILL
                         I made it up!

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

               DAWN and BRUCE kiss goodbye in the porch. She pulls away,
               sensing something amiss.

                                   DAWN
                         What's wrong?

               He looks away, unhappy and awkward.

                                   DAWN
                         What is it?

                                   BRUCE
                         We're not supposed to say, but
                         we're being shipped out tomorrow.

                                   DAWN
                         Where?

                                   BRUCE
                         I don't know?

                                   DAWN
                         You do, you do. You're just not
                         saying.

                                   BRUCE
                         I swear I don't know.
                             (offers her a little
                              box)
                         Here's your Christmas present.

               She opens it. A diamond ring. She gasps, then trusts it back
               at him angrily.

                                   DAWN
                         You expect me to spend the rest of
                         the war sitting at home staring at
                         a ring? And you'll meet some French
                         girl who can speak your own
                         language. No thank you!

                                   BRUCE
                         Please yourself.

               BRUCE hurls the little box into the next-door bomb site and
               storms off into the night. DAWN slams the door.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               DAWN buries her head in a cushion, crying and wailing. Only
               MAC and MOLLY of the guests remain, and they are playing
               cards with CLIVE and GRACE. GRACE goes to comfort DAWN.

                                   GRACE
                         What is it, pet?

                                   DAWN
                         He's being posted. I was terrible
                         to him.

                                   GRACE
                         Don't leave it like that. Go after
                         him. Swallow your pride.

               EXT. ARMY CAMP - DAY

               CLIVE and DAWN riding pillion, pull up at the Guard House on
               his old Norton. DAWN slides down and hurries to the Guard
               House. CLIVE props up the bike and follows her. A convoy of
               trucks pulls out of the gate. Soldiers lean out of the back
               of the lorries, cheering and whistling when they see DAWN.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - DAY

               The SERGEANT of the Guard sits toasting his toes on a coke
               stove. DAWN addresses CLIVE as he enters.

                                   DAWN
                         We've missed them. They've gone.
                             (turns back to the
                              Sergeant)
                         Can't you tell me where? You can
                         see I'm not a spy.

                                   SERGEANT
                         I would if I could, but I can't.

               He points to a  wall on which two posters are pinned. One
               says 'Careless talk costs lives, the other, ' Walls Have
               Ears'. DAWN is shattered. CLIVE puts his arm about her.

                                   CLIVE
                         He'll write as soon as he can.

                                   SERGEANT
                         Sure, he will. You'll meet again
                             (sings)
                         don't know where,
                         don't know when.
                         But in the meantime, I am free
                         tomorrow night.

               CLIVE leads her out. A sprig of mistletoe hangs over the
               door. DAWN rips it down and flings it back at the SERGEANT.
               It hits him square in the face.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

               CLIVE is packed up, ready to go. The family has come to bid
               farewell, all except BILL, who suddenly appears with a
               triumphant whoop.

                                   BILL
                         I found it! I found it!

               He hands the little ring box to DAWN. She opens it and looks
               at the ring, but does not put it on her finer. CLIVE and
               GRACE watch tenderly.

                                   DAWN
                         You needn't have bothered, Bill.

               They watch CLIVE as he rides away. Behind them, the Christmas
               tree can be seen in the window. As they turn to go in, GRACE
               looks warily at DAWN.

                                   GRACE
                         That letter this morning, was it
                         from Bruce?

               DAWN nods.

                                   GRACE
                         What did he say?

                                   DAWN
                         He said I was right. I shouldn't
                         wait for him. I was better to make
                         a clean break.

                                   GRACE
                         I think it's very sensible in the
                         circumstances.

                                   DAWN
                         Now he's gone and made me fall in
                         love with him, which I never wanted
                         to do. I told him that.

               She runs into the house and up the stairs.

               EXT. SEASIDE RESORT - DAY

               GRACE, MAC, BILL and SUE are finishing a frugal picnic on the
               beach. They are muffled up against the nip of early spring.
               The sand is criss-crossed with pointed iron spikes and coils
               of barbed wire. Curt signs warn against mines and other
               hazards. BILL and SUE start to play happily and messily in
               the sand. In the distance, they hear MUFFLED, deep-throated
               EXPLOSIONS.

                                   BILL
                         What's that?

                                   MAC
                         Big Berthas, shelling France.
                         Twenty-five-mile range, they have.

                                   BILL
                         Wow!

                                   MAC
                         They send over a few every day, to
                         let them know we're still here.
                         Each shell costs as much as a Ford
                         8.

                                   BILL
                         Who pays for them?

                                   MAC
                         We will, you will, for the rest of
                         our lives?

               BILL gets out a rubber ball, and spins it in is fingers.

                                   GRACE
                         Remember this beach, Mac? All those
                         summers. Out two families,
                         together.

                                   MAC
                         Happy days.
                             (watches Bill's efforts
                              with the ball)
                         When you're bigger, Bill, I'll
                         teach you the googly.

               BILL smiles a secret smile.

                                   BILL
                         Thanks.

               GRACE starts to sing.

                                   GRACE
                             (singing)
                         There'll be blue birds over,
                         The white cliffs of Dover...

               MAC and the children join in. BILL practices his spin, finger
               and wrist.

                                   ALL
                             (singing)
                         ...tomorrow.
                         Just you wait and see...

               Another CRUMP from Big Bertha.

                                   BILL
                         There goes another Ford 8, Uncle
                         Mac.

               EXT. RAILWAY - NIGHT

               The train is unlit to comply with the blackout, the only
               illumination being as the fire-box door of the loco opened.

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Moonlight flickers intermittently into the compartment,
               lending a jerky, monochrome quality to the scene. SUE sleeps,
               thumb in mouth. BILL dozes in the corner of the compartment.
               GRACE and MAC sit side by side.

                                   GRACE
                             (softly)
                         Mac, did you ever find out who
                         Molly went off with?

                                   MAC
                         A Polish pilot. It's like one of
                         those jokes on the wireless.

               He stares out of the window, the pale broken light making
               patterns on his face.

                                   GRACE
                         You miss her. I know you do.

               He smiles ruefully.

                                   MAC
                         She said, 'I know you love me, Mac,
                         but you've never loved me enough.'

                                   GRACE
                         Not loving enough. That is a
                         terrible thing to do to someone. I
                         suppose I did it to Clive. Always
                         held something back.

               BILL stirs and fidgets, half hearing, squinting through
               drooping lids. MAC and GRACE lower their voices further
               whispering.

                                   MAC
                         It's all better left unsaid, Grace.

                                   GRACE
                         You were never apart, you and
                         Clive. He kept asking and asking.
                         And I waited and waited for you to
                         say something. And you never did.

                                   MAC
                         Clive had a job. I didn't. I
                         couldn't.

               They fall silent. GRACE smiles ruefully.

                                   GRACE
                         He could always make me laugh.

                                   MAC
                         We did the decent thing.

                                   GRACE
                         This war's put an end to decent
                         things. I want to close my eyes and
                         jump and give myself for once, hold
                         nothing back.

                                   MAC
                         We can't change what's past. Not
                         even the war can do that.

                                   GRACE
                         We did all the proper things, and
                         we lost love. That's sad, Mac.

               Their eyes meet and acknowledge what might have been, of
               happiness accidentally missed.

                                   GRACE
                         If I saw this at the pictures, I'd
                         be crying my eyes out, but I can't
                         shed a tear for myself.

               In the pale half-light, they seem young and innocent. He
               takes her hand. They almost kiss. But for children, they
               would. Finally, MAC turns away and looks out at the dark,
               heavy shapes of the approaching city.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - NIGHT

               As GRACE, MAC, BILL and SUE turn into the avenue, they see a
               house burning. It is theirs. When they get closer, they see
               it is gutted and the roof has collapsed. The firemen have
               hoses trained on it, but it is too hot to get into the front
               door. GRACE'S first thought is for her Daughter.

                                   GRACE
                         Dawn! Dawn!

               DAWN is with a knot of neighbours, watching the blaze. GRACE
               is so relieved to see her that she smiles and becomes quite
               tranquil.

                                   GRACE
                         Thank God you're safe.

               The FIRECHIEF approaches her.

                                   FIRECHIEF
                         Was this your house, madam?

                                   GRACE
                         I didn't know there was a raid.

                                   FIRECHIEF
                         It wasn't a bomb, just afire.

                                   GRACE
                         What do you mean, a fire?

                                   FIRECHIEF
                         It happens in wartime as well, you
                         know.

               MAC is shattered. He puts an arm round GRACE. She throws him
               a look, haunted with guilt, and she moves away to console her
               children, who watch the blaze impassively.

                                   DAWN
                         I just wished I'd worn my nylons.

               GRACE suddenly seized by a dread thought. She runs to the
               FIRECHIEF.

                                   GRACE
                         My ration books are in there.

               She makes a wild dash at the house, but MAC and the
               neighbours restain her. BILL remains next to the FIRECHIEF.

                                   BILL
                         My shrapnel collection should be
                         all right.

                                   FIRECHIEF
                         Oh yes, I should think so.

               EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               Mac's car drives up to the charred ruins of the house. GRACE
               and the children get out. ROGER and his gang are already
               looting. BILL charges ROGER and punches him in the face. They
               fall and roll in the wet ashes. The bigger boy is so taken
               aback by BILL'S ferocity that he cannot gain an advantage.
               MAC stops GRACE from interfering, understanding the boy's
               need.
               PAULINE has appeared and smiles knowingly as she watches.
               Other children gather. ROGER picks himself up and the gang
               beats a retreat.

               INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

               GRACE, MAC, DAWN and SUE join BILL in the house and scratch
               among the debris to see what can be salvaged.

               EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY

               They ferry bit and pieces to the car. GRACE discovers the
               charred remnants of a photo album. There are pictures with un
               burnt fragments and she carries it carefully to the car.

                                   GRACE
                         Mac, look! Some of the snaps are
                         saved.

               It is open at the picture of the two families at the very
               beach they visited yesterday. It is burned around the edges,
               only MOLLY and CLIVE are unscathed and they smile happily.
               GRACE and MAC look at it then at each other. It feeds their
               guilt. The neighbours gather and awkwardly try to express
               their sympathy. MRS. EVANS arrives with some clothes.

                                   MRS. EVANS
                         This coat should fit you Grace. And
                         here are some things for Dawn. And
                         a few bits for the kitchen.

                                   GRACE
                         Thank you, Evelyne.

               BILL is acutely embarrassed. He catches PAULINE'S smirking
               look. He fights to hold back the tears, but finally fails.

                                   GRACE
                         It's only a house. We still have
                         each other.

                                   BILL
                         I don't care about the house, I
                         just hate all these people watching
                         us and being nice.

               EXT. THE THAMES RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Carrying GRACE and the three children, MAC's car draws up on
               the towpath facing an island on which is a number of wooden
               bungalows with verandas decorated in fretted scroll work.
               Neat lawns slope down to the river's edge where varnished
               punts and skiffs like sleekly tethered. GRANDFATHER GEORGE 
               has spotted them and he rear-sculls his dinghy across the
               water to fetch them.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Coming. Coming. Deliverance is at
                         hand. All will be well.

               GRANDMOTHER comes down from the bungalow to the edge of the
               river and waves encouragingly. BILL is captivated by the
               river. Moorhens thread through the tendrils of weeping
               willow. As electric slip launch is moored where they wait. He
               strokes its glassy varnish. MAC unloads the boot of the car.

                                   MAC
                         Another world, eh Billy? And not
                         twenty miles from Picadilly.

               GRACE comes alongside DAWN and waves her mother on the far
               bank, only forty yards away. DAWN glances nervously at GRACE.

                                   DAWN
                         Are you strong enough for another
                         shock? You're going to be a
                         grandma.
                             (waves across the river
                              at her own
                              Grandmother.)
                         Hello, Grandma.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE  docks his craft expertly and lassoes a
               mooring post. GRACE lets out an hysterical cry.

                                   GRACE
                         I don't believe this is happening
                         to me.

                                   DAWN
                         It's not. It's happening to me.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         responding to GRACE

               It's only a house, and a ghastly one at that. They should all
               be burned and bombed and the builder hanged.

               MAC and GRANDFATHER GEORGE load the family's few possessions
               on the boat.

                                   GRACE
                         What did I do to deserve this?

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You married that fool, Clive,
                         that's what. Never mind, you can
                         stay with us.

                                   GRACE
                             (to Dawn)
                         How long?

                                   DAWN
                         Three and a half months.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         As long as that? Well, all right.
                         Why not? It's nearly summer. Let
                         the nippers run wild.

               The children have got into the boat. GRACE turns to MAC and
               kisses him awkwardly.

                                   GRACE
                         Bless you, Mac. What would I have
                         done without you?

                                   MAC
                             (ruefully)
                         You might still have a house.

                                   GRACE
                             (wistfully)
                         I wish it could all have been
                         different.

                                   MAC
                         Look after yourself, Grace.

               He watches them as they cross the river, conscious of the gap
               widening between himself and GRACE.

                                   GRACE
                         Everything I have left in the world
                         is in this little boat.

               BILL studies GRANDFATHER GEORGE's sculling technique.

                                   BILL
                         Can I try?

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Put your hand on mine, get the
                         knack of it.

               BILL holds the gnarled old hand and moves in unison.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I shall teach you the ways of the
                         river. Another year in that awful
                         suburb and you would be past
                         saving. Look, they're coming this
                         way! The future on the march. I
                         curse you, Volt, Watt and Amp.

               Looming over GRANDFATHER GEORGE's bungalow is a newly
               constructed electric pylon.

               INT. BUNGALOW - BILL'S AND DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

               BILL wakes, looks at the river.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAWN

               A grey dawn light touches the mist lying over a glassy river.
               BILL comes down out of the house and stands at the edge of
               the water: not a breath of wind, not a soul stirring. He
               slips out of his grandfather's voluminous pajama pants.
               Delicately, he lowers himself into the river, careful not to
               crack the perfect smoothness of the water. He slides slowly
               in until only his head is showing. He swims out into the
               centre of the stream, without disturbing the water. He stops,
               takes a breath then submerges, leaving not a ripple, never a
               trace. The dawn river is once more unobserved, its secret
               self again.

               INT. BUNGALOW - BILL'S AND DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

               BILL comes in wet from bathing, to find DAWN half dressed
               contemplating her slightly swollen nave. They share a small
               room in which are two bunk beds.

                                   DAWN
                         Have a listen. See if you can hear
                         anything.

               With some reluctance, BILL puts an ear to her stomach. His
               cold wet hair gives her a shock. She slaps him.

                                   DAWN
                         You're icy cold. A shock like that
                         could give me a miscarriage.
                             (grinning)
                         That's an idea, do it again.

               DAWN giggles and it is BILL's turn to be shocked.

                                   GRANDMA (O.S.)
                         Breakfast, all!

               DAWN leaves the room while BILL climbs into his clothes.

               INT. BUNGALOW - DINING ROOM - DAY

               The room lets out, through open French windows, on to a back
               garden sown with vegetables for some yards and then giving
               way to orchard and pasture. The morning sun streams in.
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE sits at ne end facing the garden. GRACE,
               SUE, GRANDMA and DAWN flank him. GRANDFATHER GEORGE  is not
               the best in the morning. He glares at BILL as he enters and
               slips quietly into his seat.

                                   GRANDMA
                         Did they say how long it would take
                         to get new ration books, Grace?

                                   GRACE
                             (shouting and
                              emancipating)
                         Up to six weeks, I think.

                                   GRANDMA
                         How are we going to cope?

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Nettle soup, like we did in the
                         Great War. Very nourishing. Bill
                         and I will catch fish. The river
                         fowl will be laying eggs soon.
                         We'll hunt, We'll forage. We'll
                         overcome.

                                   GRANDMA
                         What about tea and sugar. Clever
                         Dick?

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE holds up a warming hand.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Keep still! Nobody move!

               His aspect fills them with dread. His eyes are boring holes
               in the cabbage patch, outside the French windows, where a rat
               is crouching.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                             (dramatic whisper)
                         Mother!! Fetch my gun.

                                   GRANDMA
                         What's that, dear?

               He points urgently at where the gun stands against the wall.
               GRANDMA creeps on tiptoe over to the gun and hands it to him,
               resuming her place without making a sound. He raises the
               shotgun, aiming along the length of the table. The children
               are statues, only their eyes darting from him to the rat and
               back. The barrel is inches from their faces. He fires. They
               jump. Smoke fills the room, He curses under his breath, as
               the rat escapes. He puts down the gun and readdresses his
               boiled egg, as an afterthought, he turns to BILL.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Never let a rat creep up on you.

                                   BILL
                         I think you hit him, Grandpa. He
                         was limping when he ran off.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE gives him a searching look, but BILL is
               all innocence. DAWN stifles a giggle. GRACE sees what goes on
               and suppresses a smile herself. BILL suddenly coughs and
               splutters to hid his laughter.
               DAWN goes red in the face, tears come to her eyes and her
               shoulders shake. SUE suddenly tinkles with innocent mirth and
               the suppressed laughter bursts out of them all. They roar and
               gasp and shudder and cannot stop. GRANDMA, quiet perplexed,
               smiles, happy to see them all so happy. GRANDFATHER GEORGE,
               eyes blazing with anger, glares at them disdainfully, but the
               dam has burst and, fear him as they do, the laughter pours
               out unabated and their eyes are filled with tears.

               INT. RIVER - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE  poles the punt up the river. GRACE, 
               GRANDMA and SUE lounge in the cushions. BILL stands alongside
               the old man, learning the way of it.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Up, two, three. Throw the pole
                         forward, let it slide through your
                         fingers.  Don't push until it hits
                         the bottom.

               BILL takes it all in.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Now check that spinner.

               BILL crawls along the shiny deck and hauls in a fishing line.

                                   BILL
                         No luck, Grandpa.

               He lets it out again. A wood-fired steam launch, all polished
               brass, with an elegant canopy, chugs past them. An elderly
               couple occupies it, seated in wicker armchairs.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                             (raises his cap to them)
                         Good day, ma,am. Greetings
                         Edward.

               They are beguiled by the smell of the afternoon. GRACE trails
               her fingers dreamily through in the water. Willows,
               bulrushes, glides past.

                                   GRANDMA
                         ...such nice boys with straw
                         boaters and blazers. All the punts
                         lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like
                         fireflies. And the gramophone going
                         on one of the boats. Always the
                         Charleston, the Charleston, the
                         Charleston. Oh, you girls.

                                   GRACE
                         Wasn't it lovely?

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE entrusts the pole to BILL. He struggles
               with the technique, does quite well. The the pole sticks in
               deep mud. He cannot extricate it.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Let it go. Let it go.

               But BILL hangs on to the pole and the punt moves on until he
               is stretched between them. Finally, he hops on to the pole
               and clings to it.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Stay put. Hang on.

               He takes a paddle and drives the boat back to where BILL is
               stranded. The pole starts to topple in a small arc.
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE renews his efforts and BILL is able to
               step neatly on to the rear decking. The old an eases the pole
               from the mud.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Now there's a lesson for life.
                         Never give up the punt for the
                         pole.

               EXT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S RIVERSIDE GARDEN - DAY

               Tea is being laid on the lawn by GRANDMA, GRACE and DAWN;
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE reclines in the faded swing-seat. BILL
               ferries FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY (his three aunts) to the
               island in the dingy. He rear-sculls with some difficulty, but
               well enough. GRANDFATHER GEORGE examines his daughters with
               binoculars as they 'ooh' and 'aah' greetings on their
               approach. They disembark and there is much hugging and
               kissing. They have all brought clothing for the family and
               dresses and blouses are held up, examined and admired.

               The daughters clearly disapprove of GRANDFATHER GEORGE and
               only offer perfunctory kisses, HOPE ignoring him completely.
               SUE is held up and passed from hand to hand as though she
               were a frock herself. They take it in turns to shout
               clarification to their mother. They flutter around DAWN, who
               is now showing her pregnancy.

                                   FAITH
                         No word from Bruce, my pet?

               It was meant well, but it makes DAWN bristle.

                                   FAITH
                         All men are beasts, darling.

                                   DAWN
                         That's what I like about them.

                                   FAITH
                         Dawn! Really!

               BILL slides over to his grandfather.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         All hens and no cocks. Too many
                         women in the family. They're a
                         different species from us, Bill.
                         Love them, but don't try to
                         understand them. That road leads to
                         ruin. Let's make a nuisance of
                         ourselves.

               He mingles among the women, deciding to goad his daughter
               HOPE.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You look frustrated, Hope. That
                         husband of yours still can't rise
                         to the occasion?

               HOPE flares up, but bites her tongue and turns away.
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns to BILL, confidingly.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I won't have the husbands here. All
                         four married duds, including your
                         mother.

                                   HOPE
                         He's a menace. He ought to be
                         locked up.

                                   CHARITY
                         Don't let him get his claws into
                         you Billy, Grace.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE continues his advice to BILL.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         They'll tame you if they can, cage
                         you and feed you tidbits. Better
                         retreat to prepared positions.

               He leads BILL round to the back garden away  from the river.
               All the bungalows are built up on piers against flooding. He
               reaches under the house and retrieves an old cricket bat and
               ball. He thrusts the ball at BILL.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Bags I bat first.

               He takes guard against the trunk of an old apple tree. BILL
               twists his fingers around the ball and bowls a spinner to
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE who waits for it to break, then plays it
               back. The next ball breaks the other way and clean bowls him.
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE looks back at BILL with astonishment.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         That was a googly!

                                   BILL
                         I know.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You're a dark horse, bowling
                         googlies at your age. Toss me up
                         another.

                                   BILL
                         No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my
                         turn.

               With ill grace, GRANDFATHER GEORGE surrenders the bat and
               offers a harmless arthritic delivery which BILL thumps into
               the gooseberry bushes. GRANDFATHER GEORGE curses and pricks
               his fingers as he tries to retrieves the ball. He looks up
               irritably at the sounds of laughter from his daughters. He
               snarls in their direction.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Want to know why they're called
                         Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

                                   BILL
                         Why?

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Your grandmother. She named them
                         after virtues I lack. That's
                         marriage for you.

               He bowls again. BILL hammers it away. GRANDFATHER GEORGE
               glares at him, trembling with fury.

                                   BILL
                         It's only a game, Grandpa.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE gets himself under control and trots off
               to find the ball.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               BILL and SUE are in the dingy, pushing a stand of reeds. BILL
               hangs over and bows, hauling the boat along by pulling on the
               reeds. The parting rushes reveal a moorhens nest, neatly
               suspended above the water on bent-over reeds meshed together.
               There are some dozen speckled eggs. BILL carefully extracts
               one of them ad places it in a little basket in the boat,
               which already contains a number of eggs which he has
               presumably taken from other nests.

               Further upstream, BILL steps out of the boat into some
               shallows.
               He gropes under the water and hauls up a night fishing line.
               SUE shares his disappointment when there is no catch.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               The dingy pulls up at the landing stage. GRANDFATHER GEORGE,
               using a stick, limps down the garden to meet them. SUE hands
               him the basket of eggs.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Where's the fish? No fish, no
                         supper. Be off with you and don't
                         come back empty handed.

               He gives the boat a shove with his stick and turns back to
               the house. SUE looks weepy. BILL mouths some of his
               repertoire of swear words. From the dormer window, DAWN
               witnesses their humiliation. She laughs and waves. As
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns back to the house, she ducks out of
               sight.

               EXT. WEIR - DAY

               They row up to the head of the weir. BILL casts a line and
               fixes the rod to the gunwale, He ties up the boat and slips
               over the side. He checks a net arrangement he has fixed at
               the base of the waterfall to snare unwary fish swimming over
               the weir. It is empty. SUE paddles in the soft weed that
               grows on the steps of the weir, letting it seep between her
               toes. BILL kneels and runs his fingers through the same
               luminous-green weed. They become absorbed in it. BILL lowers
               his body into the water and lets himself slide over the weed.
               SUE follows suit. Soon they have discovered a glorious game,
               sliding like eels down the weir and plunging into the pool
               below. Back and forth they go. In the far distance, an air
               raid siren wails, They pay no attention, so caught up are
               they in their pleasure. SUE checks the fishing line fixed to
               the boat. Nothing.

                                   SUE
                         I'm scared of going back without
                         any fish. I hate Grandpa.

               They look up at the SOUND of 'ack-ack' fire. BILL spots a
               German plane high above them.

                                   BILL
                         Looks like a stray bomber. He's
                         lost his squadron.

               Suddenly there is a BLAST OF AIR and a BOOMING EXPLOSION. Two
               hundred yards up the river, a great plume of water spurts up.
               They drop flat on the steps of the weir. BILL peers
               cautiously over the rim of the waterfall. SUE seems his
               astonishment turn to a broad grin. Floating towards the weir
               are dozens of fish stunned by the blast. Joyously, they
               gather them up and throw them into the boat.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               GRACE, dawn and the GRANDPARENTS all look amazed admiration
               at the boat laden with fish.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         This is going too far, young man.

                                   BILL
                         But Grandpa, you said...

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I concede I was insistent, but how
                         the Devil...

               DAWN looks sharply at the smug faces of her brother and
               sister.

                                   DAWN
                         It looks a bit fishy to me.

                                   GRACE
                         Could we salt them, or smoke them,
                         do you think?

               They fall to unloading the fish.

                                   GRANDMA
                         It's like feeding of the five
                         thousand. It's a miracle.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Well,lad. So it's miracles now, is
                         it?

                                   DAWN
                         They'll stink the place out by
                         morning. Why not invite all your
                         friends to supper, Grandpa.

               He looks up darkly from his task.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I have no friends, only relations.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               BILL, now wielding the pole with great aplomb, send the punt
               gliding up river. DAWN heavily pregnant and languidly
               melancholic, lies in the cushions, bare foot dangling in the
               river. DAWN stiffens as the figure of a man in uniform comes
               running along the riverbank. As he catches up with them, he
               is revealed as BRUCE and the uniform of a Canadian soldier.
               He waves and calls them.

                                   DAWN
                         Ignore him, the bastard.

               BILL hesitates, but a withering look from DAWN keeps him on
               course. BRUCE levels with them. He calls across thirty yards
               of river.

                                   BRUCE
                         Dan! It's me!

               She refuses even to acknowledge him. Under her breath, she
               instructs BILL.

                                   DAWN
                         Keep going. Stay on this bank.

               BILL whips up speed, keeping to the opposite side of the
               river from BRUCE, who wades out up to his knees and holds out
               his arms, pleadingly.

                                   BRUCE
                         Give me a chance to explain.

               SUE waves at him. DAWN glowers at her.

                                   DAWN
                         I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.

               Fully clothed, his khaki cap perched on his head, BRUCE swims
               out towards the punt. By the time he reaches the middle of
               the river, they are fifty years upstream. BRUCE swims back to
               the shore. Dripping wet, he runs up the riverbank until he is
               well ahead of the punt and plunges in again. This time, his
               course coincides with the punt. He grabs the side of the boat
               and hangs on, out of breath.

                                   BRUCE
                         Couldn't write...secret
                         posting...came as soon as I heard
                         about the baby.

               DAWN grabs a paddle and forces him under the water. He pops
               up further down the boat.

                                   BRUCE
                         I went AWOL to be with you. I'm a
                         deserter.

               She cracks the paddle over his head. He sinks under the
               water, his cap floats away. BILL rescues it. BRUCE does not
               reappear. They wait, become alarmed. DAWN kneels down, peers
               into the water.

                                   DAWN
                         Oh, Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?

               His head pops up inches from her face. Levering himself up on
               the boat, he kisses her on the mouth. She grabs his hair
               smothering him with kisses.

                                   DAWN
                         I missed you so much.

               BILL and SUE exchange disgusted looks.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               They are all gathered together. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, GRANDMA,
               GRACE, HOPE, CHARITY, BILL and SUE. CLIVE, in uniform, gives
               his daughter way. MAC and MOLLY are together again All
               witness the quiet, subdued marriage of DAWN and BRUCE. The
               only guests are two military POLICEMEN sit in the back. They
               appear to be ordinary soldiers until they step outside the
               church and put their red caps on.

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY

               The bridal pair come out and the VICAR, considerably
               embarrassed, makes his excuses and backs away. A picture is
               taken. The REDCAPS seize BRUCE by each arm. DAWN clings to
               him, a last kiss, and he is borne away. They all stand at the
               church doors waving to him as he is driven away in a jeep.
               There is some dutiful sniffing from the women, but since DAWN
               seems quite happy, there is no need for sympathetic tears.
               GRACE impulsively hugs MOLLY.

                                   GRACE
                         I'm so glad you could come. Here we
                         are, all together again.

                                   MOLLY
                         Happy as can be. In the old groove.

               CLIVE shakes MAC's hand warmly.

                                   MAC
                         So you're going to be a
                         grandfather.

                                   CLIVE
                         And I'm still just a lad myself.

                                   MAC
                         Don't bother to grow up. It's no
                         fun at all.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

               The party is on the veranda. BILL and SUE sit on the steps.
               GRANDFATHER is alone on the swing seat. GRACE and her three
               sisters are a sting quartet. They finish a piece. The others
               clap. It leaves them a little melancholy.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         What can you do with four
                         daughters, I asked myself, A string
                         quartet was all I could come up
                         with. They hated me for making them
                         learn.

                                   GRACE
                         And now we're glad you did.

               CLIVE raises his glass. He is tipsy.

                                   CLIVE
                         Here's to music. And absent
                         friends.

                                   MAC
                         And absent bridegrooms!

                                   CLIVE
                         And the bride.

                                   ALL
                         The bride.

                                   CLIVE
                         And here's to my CO. He's wangled
                         me a posting close to home. He said
                         your house burns down, your
                         daughter gets married, you're
                         always on compassionate leave. You
                         might as well stay down there!

               There are cries of congratulations and encouragement.

                                   GRACE
                         I've found a bungalow to rent up
                         the towpath, Clive. I never want to
                         leave the river again. The children
                         have had such a wonderful summer.

                                   CLIVE
                         Fair enough.
                             (raises glass)
                         The river.

                                   ALL
                         The river.

                                   CLIVE
                         And loyal friends.

               He tips his glass at MAC, who squirms a little. The drink has
               made CLIVE sound excessively sincere and sentimental, so much
               so that if he were sober, it might seem like irony.

                                   CLIVE
                         ...and good and faithful wives.

               He points his glass at MOLLY and GRACE and waves it at the
               sisters and DAWN.

                                   CLIVE
                         We hope, and trust.

               He laughs, and the others join in, an awkward moment. GRACE
               and MOLLY catch each others eye.

                                   CLIVE
                         And grumpy grandfathers.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Since you are shortly to join our
                         ranks, I throw down the gauntlet. A
                         cricket match. You and Mac against
                         Bill and me. Back garden.

               The three men and one boy rise to the challenge and file down
               the side of the house to the lawn at the back.

                                   CLIVE
                         You know Mac played for Surrey
                         Seconds, and I opened for the
                         Indian Army. Are you sure...

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE waves his objection aside.

                                   MAC
                             (to Clive, an aside)
                         It's an olive branch. Take it.
                         It's the best he can do.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - GARDEN - DAY

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         We're putting you in to bat.

               He hands CLIVE the bat, and flips the ball to BILL with a
               broad wink. CLIVE takes guard against the apple tree, which
               is now heavy with fruit. BILL bowls. The ball turns, beats
               the bat. MAC pats down the grass where the ball bounced.

                                   CLIVE
                         Fine delivery, Bill, Good length.
                         Turned a bit too.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE hands the ball back to BILL and nudges
               him.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                             (whispering)
                         Give him the you-know-what.

                                   BILL
                         Very well, Grandpa.

               BILL delivers his googly. It bamboozles is father who pops up
               caught and bowled. CLIVE is startled. As MAC takes the bat,
               CLIVE offers a warning.

                                   CLIVE
                         I think it was a googly.

               MAC takes guard. BILL Bowls. He plays forward, smothering the
               spin. Still no run. The next ball is pitched short. MAC plays
               back, waits for the ball to break in from the leg which it
               does more sharply than he expects. He just manages to dig it
               out. The next is the googly. MAC does not spot it. It cuts i
               from the off and clean bowls him. GRANDFATHER GEORGE cackles
               triumphantly.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Googly. You didn't spot it either.

                                   CLIVE
                         I taught him how and now he turns
                         it against me.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?

                                   MAC
                         The wicked old bugger.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         This boy will make his way in the
                         world.

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE slaps BILL on the back with such
               enthusiasm that he sends the boy sprawling. CLIVE catches
               him, holds him close and whispers in his ear.

                                   CLIVE
                         I'm proud of you.

               Cries of alarm come from the house. CLIVE hears his name
               called. They hurry back.

               INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The men arrive to find the women in a state of alarm. They
               are gathered in a knot around DAWN. BILL pushes his way
               forward.

                                   GRACE
                         Clive, go for the doctor. It's
                         Dawn. She's in labour.

               BILL peers between the women and catches a glimpse of DAWN
               standing arched against a chair, one hand supporting the
               baby's head which has appeared between her legs.

                                   CLIVE
                         Hot water! Lots of hot water!

                                   FAITH
                         What for?

                                   CLIVE
                         I don't know. They always say that
                         at the pictures.

               He rushes out.

               EXT. BUNGALOW - VERANDA  - DAY

               CLIVE runs down to veranda steps.

                                   HOPE
                         She just went to the toilet, and it
                         came out.

               MAC joins CLIVE and they run to the boat and fumble awkwardly
               with the oars.

               INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               GRACE tries to be calm. She holds DAWN gingerly.

                                   GRACE
                         Now take deep breaths, and push.

                                   DAWN
                         Why? It's coming on its own. It
                         doesn't hurt.

               BILL comes to SUE's side and they catch another glimpse of
               the baby's head. SUE wrinkles her nose.

                                   SUE
                         It's all sticky.

               BILL passes clean out and crumples to the floor.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF A GREAT HOUSE - DAY

               BILL is running flat out, running for his life. He passes a
               blurred orchard, a garden, a park.

               EXT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY

               BILL, still running hard, looks over his shoulder and turns
               in to a bungalow that faces on to the river.

               INT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY

               The living room is cheerful and spacious. Out of the window,
               the sun sets over the river. DAWN breast-feeds the baby, now
               a week or two old. GRACE knits a tiny pair of leggings. SUE
               is drawing a picture. CLIVE snoozes in an armchair. They are
               listening to Churchill on the wireless.

                                   CHURCHILL (V.O.)
                         ...it is not the end. It is not the
                         beginning.

               BILL enters, flushed and panting. His eyes are bright with
               excitement. He goes to DAWN and, reaching inside his shirt,
               pulls out a peach and hands it to her reverentially.

                                   BILL
                         I scrumped it. I nearly got caught.
                         They chased me for ages.

               DAWN take's it. It looks pretty miserable. Most of the furry
               skin has rubbed off during its hazardous journey next to
               BILL's skin. DAWN's first impulse is to make a sarcastic
               comment, but in her new maturity, she bites it back and
               smiles.

                                   DAWN
                         You did that for me, and on the
                         last day of your holidays?

                                   BILL
                             (blushing)
                         Well, for the baby, really.

                                   DAWN
                         Thank you Billy, from the baby and
                         me.

               INT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S CAR - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE drives his old Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire
               along the river towpath. Beside him sits a very morose BILL
               wearing  a school cap, with a satchel, gasmask, and a
               suitcase on his lap. GRANDFATHER GEORGE adjusts the
               advance/retard lever and glares at the sullen boy.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You miserable little tripe-hound.
                         I'm the one who should be fed up,
                         sacrificing my last sup of black
                         market petrol to take you to
                         school.

                                   BILL
                         I have to live in Rosehill Avenue
                         as well.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Only till they get you into the
                         local school.

                                   BILL
                         With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You'll be at home for the weekends.
                         Now shut up, or walk.

               They pass a film unit setting up equipment on the river bank.
               Extras dressed as soldiers - Germans, British, American -
               lounge, smoke and drink tea.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Strapping fellows playing silly
                         buggers with a war on. Outrageous.

               BILL cranes back watching as long as he can.

               EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

               The car draws up outside the school entrance. A grim wall
               surrounds the institution and BILL gets out, head hung low,
               and walks towards the gate as though to the gallows.
               GRANDFATHER GEORGE watches from the car. He grips the
               steering wheel angrily. A teacher strides past. GRANDFATHER
               GEORGE shouts after him out of the window.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         All you do is knock the sense out
                         of them and fill them up with muck.

               EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

               As BILL enters, he is astonished to see hundreds of children
               in a state of delirious celebration. Boys fling their caps in
               the air. They cheer. They whoop. They run amok. Behind them
               lie the smouldering ruins of the school. BILL cheers louder
               than anyone. He remembers his grandfather, turns on his heel
               and runs back to the road.

               EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE is awkwardly turning the car in the road.
               He drives off. BILL runs flat out and comes up to the window,
               shouting.

                                   BILL
                         Grandpa! There's no school! It's
                         been hit by a bomb!

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE slows up.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         I have to hand it to you, Bill,
                         you come up with some good ones.
                         Go back and take your medicine.

               He drives off leaving BILL stranded. A fire engine and ARP
               vehicles race up to the school. They pass GRANDFATHER GEORGE
               and doubt shows in is face. He stops, gets out. Boys are
               spilling out of school, cheering. BILL runs up to him.

                                   BILL
                         It's true.

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         You're much more convincing when
                         you're making it up.

               They get into the car.

                                   BILL
                         Grandpa, if you think of something
                         hard enough, can you make it
                         happen?

                                   GRANDFATHER GEORGE
                         Apparently so.

               A barking laugh wells up and escapes his throat. It bursts
               forth in great waves like a flood that has been dammed up for
               years.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               GRANDFATHER GEORGE's laugh, and BILL's too, ring out over the
               autumn river which beckons to BILL with the promise of stolen
               days.

               THE EN]D
