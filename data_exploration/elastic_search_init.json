Then we see Allison s name, under it Alex s,                 under that Robert s, under that Quentin s, then under that                 the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by  Starring Tim                 Roth as the Bellboy.  Then  The Guests  listed in alphabetical                 order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors                  names, we...                 FADE UP ON A WALL                 The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards                 from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C.,  Wish You                 Were Here  from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches,                 etc....                 The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s                 hotel, the  Mon Signor,  in its heyday, with a full staff of                 30 people posed on the lawn in front.                 An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:                                       VOICE-OVER                          There used to be a staff of fifty in                           this place. I m the only one left                           from those days. It all comes down                           to one sap: the night-shift bellhop,                           that s me. What the hell is a bellhop?                           You know where the name comes from?                               (silence)                          Of course not... It s so simple it s                           stupid. They ring a bell and you                           hop. You hop to front and center. No                           heroes in this line, kid. Just men                           doing a job. No questions asked,                           none answered. I try to keep it                           simple, kid, not too personal...                 Another voice of a young man interrupts.                                       TED                          You met any of those old stars?                                       THE OLD GUY                          Stars! Are you kidding me? I took                           Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for                           Christ s sakes. I taught Shirley                           Temple how to roller-skate. I saw                           Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three                           cheese sandwiches right on the spot                           you re sitting, kid. What did you                           say your name was?                                       TED                          Ted.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used                           to come down at night and doze off                           in the kitchen. She liked the sound                           of the fans out back spinning around.                           Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol                           Flynn used to call me  Alibi.  You ll                           pick up a few stories yourself, kid.                                       TED                          I don t think so, not like yours.                                       THE OLD GUY                          What do you think a star does when                           he goes to the bathroom, kid?                                       TED                          Beats me.                                       THE OLD GUY                          He pulls his pants down and takes a                           crap just like you and me. Take my                           word for it.                 A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with                 a lip print on it signed  Marilyn.  The camera pulls back to                 reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a                 small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is                 dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop s cap on. He                 looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a                 young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The                 old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Camacho!                                       TED                          Who?                                       THE OLD GUY                          The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar,                           wrapped in Miami. I get a box of                           them every Christmas from the chairman                           of the board. I think he sends them                           to me to keep my mouth shut. It s                           tough not to get a little personal                           in this business.                 The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at                 his cap, lost in thought.                                       TED                          What do you mean?                 The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Put it on.                 Ted puts the cap on.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Frankly, you look stupid... like the                           Philip Morris guy. I can t believe I                           wore that thing for fifty years. You                           keep it.                 The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on.                 Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old                 straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the                 door. Ted follows.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Stay away from night clerks, kids,                           hookers, and marital disputes.                 The Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the                 eye.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Never have sex with the clientele.                                       TED                          No way, not me. You got any other                           advice.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Always get a tip.                 The door slams shut on the back room.                 INT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT                 The big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at                 one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda.                 It s also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast-                talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty --                 stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in                 hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the                 front door. Betty sees him.                                       BETTY                          Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute!                 The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around.                                       THE OLD GUY                          What?                 Betty comes from behind the desk.                                       BETTY                          I just want to say good-bye.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Who are you?                                       BETTY                          Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your                           boss.                 The Old Guy squints his eyes at the young gal.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam                           cigar went out.                                       BETTY                          Yeah, sure.                 She speaks to the Old Guy as she lights his cigar and he                 puffs away.                                       BETTY                          I just want you to know, from the                           owner and all the staff, your fifty                           years of service have been an                           inspiration to us all. You re a legend                           in your own time, and the Mon Signor                           will never be the --                                       THE OLD GUY                          Just forward my cigars, Red.

Betty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her                 in his bellbody uniform, sans cap.                                       TED                          Sam the bellboy.

Unless you sell turkeys, business is                           dead. You just got butterflies, that s                           all.

BETTY                          Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to                           do is hold the fort. It s New Year s                           Eve. Most of the guests are going                           out. You ll just be giving them a                           little nod as they come staggering                           in at three... four... five... in                           the morning. Nobody s having any                           parties, a few get-togethers, but no                           parties. You got about three people                           checking in tonight, that s it. The                           only variable is Chester Rush in the                           penthouse.                                       TED                          Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky                           Detective?                                       BETTY                          Yeah, him and his entourage checked                           in last night. They re in the                           penthouse. The only reason I refer                           to it as a variable is that he s a                           movie star. Ya never know about movie                           stars. I m tellin  ya, Ted, it s                           cake.                 Betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.                                       BETTY                               (continuing)                          And look, if you have any problems,                           call me at the party.                 Ted thinks about it for a moment.                                       TED                          Okay.                                       BETTY                          Great --                                       TED                          -- For fifty bucks.                                       BETTY                          Fifty bucks!                                       TED                          You re shirking your duties for this                           Nazi. For that you pay a price, and                           the price is fifty bucks.                                       BETTY                          One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that s                           not a fair price. You re taking                           advantage of the situation. Twenty                           bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair                           price.                                       TED                          Yeah, but what you re doin  to me                           ain t fair. And, you are completely                           and totally taking advantage of me                           and your position. So fifty bucks is                           the perfect price.                 Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.                                       BETTY                          Okay, but don t be a pussy. You don t                           bother me unless it s an emergency.                           In fact, for fifty bucks, you better                           not call me unless the fuckin                            building s burning down.                 She gives him the money.                                       BETTY                          Get ready to take the desk.                 Betty leaves.                 Ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares                 himself for the night.                 FADE TO BLACK                 STORY TITLE CARD:                                           ROOM 321                                        STRANGE BREW                  FADE IN:                 EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK                 Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a                 taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is                 a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to                 see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess).                 She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and                 is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.                 Ted takes Athena s luggage onto his cart. But one item in a                 woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is                 concerned as he attempts to lift it.                                       ATHENA                          Pleeze be careful -- my God. You                           have no idea...                 Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely                 heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily.                 The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed                 with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put                 this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at                 Ted, who is out of breath.                                       ATHENA                          I m usually a good tipper, but this                           one -- this cab driver -- he had                           green all around him. I don t like                           that in a man.                 Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.                                       TED                          Green? Is that bad? Like you read                           auras or something like that?                                       ATHENA                          Something like that.                                       TED                          Yeah, well what color are you seein                            around me... how s the tip lookin?                                       ATHENA                          I see purple... in your face, and...                 As if she can t help herself, Athena s eyes are strangely                 drawn to his crotch.                 She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be                 charmingly oblivious.                 Athena looks back into his face.                                       ATHENA                          ...you re okay.                 Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the  purple  in                 it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his                 crotch and giving her a confused side glance.                 INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK                 Ted shifts hats to check the girl in. He checks her                 reservation.                                       ATHENA                          Athena Z.                                       TED                               (scratching his head --                               weird name, okay)                          You re booked in the Honeymoon Suite --                          just one night? With all this luggage?                                       ATHENA                          I will only need to stay till sunrise.                                       TED                          Okay... and how will you be paying?                                       ATHENA                          With gold.                 He looks at this wacky Gypsy chick numbly -- she pulls out                 her Gold Card and smiles.                 EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK                 The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor.                 Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her                 room.                 AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR                 Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In                 the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids                 poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms                 beyond the still hot tub.                 Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in                 front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of                 a little Cupid and mumbles,  Perfect.                  Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed,                 she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance                 wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.                                       ATHENA                          Well -- the other bag -- I need it.                                       TED                          Right.                 He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He                 laughs sickly.                                       TED                          What the hell you got in here, lady?                           Nuclear weapons?                 She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the                 bag.                                       ATHENA                               (dryly)                          The White Cliffs of Dover.                 Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and                 pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it                 to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.                                       ATHENA                          The others will be coming soon. Send                           them, pleeze.                 Ted nods, confused by  the others,  and walks off with the                 cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.                                       TED                          Oh -- I forgot to show you how to                           turn on the Jacuzzi.                 But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water                 begins to flow from the baby cupids  urns into the hot tub.                                       ATHENA                          I been in dis  place many New Year s.                           So... you send the others to me,                           huh. Go now.                 As she says this, the door closes with a strange force,                 shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the                 suite.                 IN THE SUITE BEDROOM                 A round bed with pink tuck n roll headboard. It s impossible                 to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were                 achieved by laughing.                 Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of                 stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it                 like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the                 head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.                 Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching                 high-heeled slippers.                 And these she places with reverence on the bed.                                       ATHENA                          On this night, oh great goddess Diana,                           we restore your virgin flesh and                           bring you back to real life.                 CLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact.                                       ATHENA                          Soon -- I take you to the pond for a                           cleansing. Well, it s a swimming                           pool, but it will be under the setting                           sun, okay?                 INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS                 Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first                 guest, Elspeth arrives.                 She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue                 eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like                 Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and                 a silver sword on her shoulder.                                       TED                          May I help you?                                       ELSPETH                          I... we... have a reservation.                 Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva!                 ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a                 long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling                  PUSSY  across her breasts. This is Kiva.                 Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette                 machine. Just as Ted s eyes grow wide with anxiety, several                 packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent s hands.                                       KIVA                          Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies                           for this boring ass night.                                       ELSPETH                               (to Ted)                          We have a reservation in the Honeymoon                           Suite.                                       TED                          Oh yeah... you must be one of  the                           others.  And what re you carrying --                           the Rock of Gibraltar?                 She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He                 walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile                 luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth                 turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva                 lights up.                                       ELSPETH                          What d I tell you about smoking?                                       KIVA                          You smoke.                                       ELSPETH                          That s right -- I smoke, and I m                           addicted to it, and I don t want the                           same thing to happen to you.                                       KIVA                               (in game-show host                                voice)                           Hello -- welcome to this week s                           edition of the Hypocrite of the Year                           Award --                  As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host,                 Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with                 an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva! That s enough --                 She cuts Kiva s ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly.                                       KIVA                          You re not my mother!                                       ELSPETH                          Yes I am.                                       KIVA                          Then why re we sleeping together?                 Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning                 to unfold here.                 Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at                 his scrutiny.                                       ELSPETH                          Well... I didn t mean it... literally.                           I... I happen to be the only one                           who... cares about you --                 But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted,                 flustered.                                       ELSPETH                          Please -- take us to our room!                 Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword,                 but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots                 him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous                 laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.                 AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR                 The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee                 tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room.                 Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the                 hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With                 most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers                 are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.                 But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the                 Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white                 powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands                 him a tip as he gawks at the circle.                                       ELSPETH                          Flea powder. One of the others is                           bringing her cat.                 Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look                 to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor.                 He shakes his head and leaves.                                       ELSPETH                          You re gonna have to wait in the                           other room.                                       KIVA                          Why?                                       ELSPETH                          Because I said so.                                       KIVA                          I ll watch TV.                                       ELSPETH                          You can t watch TV because the noise                           will interfere with our ritual.                 Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway.                 She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.                                       KIVA                          Okay... Mommy.                 Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom.                 Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar,                 whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing                 the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.                 Kiva, behind Elspeth s back, exits from the bedroom doorway                 into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the                 honeymoon bedroom.                 Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with                 the  cleansed  artifact and lays the slab in the center of                 the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her                 sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with                 tender affection.                                       ATHENA                          Soon -- our goddess will come. I                           will go get her negligee.                 Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks!                 Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat                 is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes                 the negligee off the irrepressible youth.                                       ATHENA                          What are you doing! Have you no                           respect -- who -- who is dis girl?                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the                           TV! I can t leave her at home --                           she s on probation and I gotta keep                           an eye on her.                                       ATHENA                          Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot                           stay here during the ritual. She may                           be one of your kind, but she is not                           one of us.                                       ELSPETH                          She stays!! Or I go -- along with my                           offering!                 The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --                                       ATHENA                          TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!                                       KIVA                               (in a seductive pout)                          Make me...                 Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated                 as she firmly demands from Elspeth --                                       ATHENA                          Let s not forget -- I am the High                           Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis                           girl!                 Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and                 respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.                                       ATHENA                               (eyes lifted to heaven,                                wearily)                          Tell me -- did we have these problems                           in Salem? I don t think so...                 IN THE BEDROOM                 Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a                 soft touch.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva... you know what I love about                           you?                 Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.                                       ELSPETH                          Your sweet side.                                       KIVA                          And what do I get if I m sweet?                                       ELSPETH                          You get whatever you want. And you                           know what else I love about you?                                       KIVA                               (seduced now)                          What?                                       ELSPETH                          Your nose.                 And saying this, she kisses Kiva s nose and leaves the room.                 Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she                 has the last word.                                       ELSPETH                          And I saw you checking her out.                 Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.                 IN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK                 The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer                 luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous                 Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over                 her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the                 hall like a Southern princess.                                       JEZEBEL                               (talking to her cat                                in baby talk)                          Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet                           little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the                           baby.                 AT THE DOOR                 Jezebel bursts in, chattering.                                       JEZEBEL                          Well, this is just darlin ! Just                           darlin  Hi-dee, girls...                 Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place                 has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of                 exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at                 work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She                 stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub,                 which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents                 her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her                 breasts and sucks in the vibes:  Ahhhh.                  Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms,                 but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks                 it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it                 sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.                                       JEZEBEL                          Toodle-loo.                 And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors                 to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing                 on herself.                                       JEZEBEL                          Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a                           new lil  fool -- what the hell is                           she doin  here on our night of annual                           ritual?

His face is etched                 in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his                 hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.                 Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female                 intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native                 American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.                 But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down                 the hall, blissed-out.

FRONT DESK--NIGHT                 The last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from                 the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother,                 with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple                 scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by                 herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is                 Eva.

IN THE ELEVATOR                 Ted holds Eva s hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. There                 is a shy quiet tension here.

IN THE SUITE                 The room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing                 palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other-                earthly. The other four girls are arranging the altar as Eva                 enters.                                       ATHENA                          You are very late, Eva.                                       EVA                          I m sorry, Athena.

She hands him a tip and smiles, then                 takes it back.

But burying the                           placenta is also a very sound                           ecological practice --  cause of the                           oxygen it carries.

Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She                 kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar,                 and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on                 the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on                 pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from                 the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone                 to materialize into the garments.                                       ATHENA                          We need fresh rosemary from the                           kitchen. Mostly what we need is from                           the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?                 Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.                                       TED                          Yeah, yeah, rosemary.

Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. He looks at                 this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He                 turns, points at Eva.                 Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as                 she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing                 connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning                 with dizziness. Athena smirks.                                       ATHENA                          Get to work, man.                 Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs                 off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their                 most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or                 vials.                 Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction                 of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi,                 with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva...                                       KIVA                          What?

She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her                 feet.                                       KIVA                          Don t put me in there by myself.                           I ll miss you way too much.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva, don t do this to me.                 Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of                 the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.                                       KIVA                          Please... if you just lemme... I ll                           play dress-up with you, the way you                           like it... you know what I mean...                           remember...?                 Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up.                 Kiva pours on softer seduction.                                       KIVA                          We can pretend and I ll do it                           exactly... the way you want it...                           with the egg whites and the kilt.                 Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth s hand and                 presses it lightly on her face.                                       ELSPETH                          You mean... like last week?                 Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted  ick                  sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she s revealing this                 side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously                 looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted                 Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an                 impatient and stern Athena.                 Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.                                       ELSPETH                          We ll talk about this later, Kiva.                                       KIVA                               (angrily)                          No!                 She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her                 arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.                                       JEZEBEL                          Aw, really now -- child abuse?                                       ELSPETH                          You stay outta this!                                       ATHENA                          I demand this stop now, Elspeth!                 Elspeth lets go of Kiva s hair. Kiva jerks away from her.                                       KIVA                          I m running away from you!                                       ELSPETH                          Fine. Go ahead. And I ll call your                           parole officer and she ll find you                           and send you back to Eastlake!                 Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.                                       ATHENA                          Now that the fucking melodrama is                           over, can we start the goddamn ritual --                          pleeze?                 Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her                 shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.                                       ATHENA                          We are communing here on New Year s                           Eve to bring to life the great goddess                           Diana, who was turned to stone in                           this very room forty years ago today.                 The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to                 sway within the circle.                                       ATHENA                          Diana, great beautiful one, we make                           these offerings to you, that we may                           undo the wicked spell which deprived                           you of the seed of your lover, your                           virginal blood, of your very life.                           We now form the symbolic rock with                           our bodies.                 And saying this, the girls all form a  rock  with their bodies                 gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly                 they start to unfold from the rock.                 The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the                 Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of                 clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.                 They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the                 semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is                 Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself                 between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a                 bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.                                       ATHENA                          On this night, in this hour, we Call                           upon the Ancient Power O Goddess                           bride, I offer thee Milk from a                           mother s sweet titty!                 Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on                 the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now                 steps forward with her offering in a vial.                                       ELSPETH                          To reverse the evil which has been                           done I make this offering to the                           Divine One A whore not, an innocent                           was, For whom I seized a virgin s                           blood.                                       JEZEBEL                          Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust,                           To undo this awful spell is a real                           must. To bring you life and get you                           high I offer the sweat of five men s                           thighs.                 The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her                 offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle.                 Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She                 unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.                                       RAVEN                          Diana, oh great one, we live without                           sun Until this wicked curse is undone.                           In hope that you live, and to us                           appear, I have collected a year s                           worth of tears.                 She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it s                 Eva s turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the                 altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting                 for Eva s offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she                 goes.                 Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle                 with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to                 incant.                                       EVA                          Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will,                           I was to bring fresh sperm from my                           Bill. I had him erect, and his semen                           would follow But alas I was hot, so                           hot that I swallowed.                 The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK! Athena                 opens her eyes, wildly.                                       ATHENA                          You stupid little witch! You swallowed                           the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!                 Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.                                       ELSPETH                          It just shows what an amazing lack                           of control you have over yourself,                           Eva!                                       JEZEBEL                          Honey, why didn t you just use your                           hands? Didn t your mama teach you                           not to put them things in your mouth?                                       RAVEN                          I understand though...                 Eva bursts into tears. Athena is firm.                                       ATHENA                          There is no time to cry over swallowed                           sperms. You re gonna have to get                           some, baby. You have one hour to                           prove what kind of witch you really                           are.                 Just then: a knock at the door.                                       ATHENA                               (calling out)                          What do you want?!                                       TED                          Ted... the bellboy.                 Athena smiles and turns to Eva.                                       ATHENA                          Mr. Bellboy, come right in!                 Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the                 fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all                 except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.                 Amazingly, Ted s attention is captivated by Eva s sorrow,                 not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers                 her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks                 away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart.                 Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels                 in the cart.                                       TED                          Here s the things you asked for. Oh,                           and uhh, sorry, but I m not gonna                           pick the eyes outta this dead fish.                 He points to the trout. Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes                 into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window.                 She smirks at him comtemptuously.                                       ATHENA                               (handing Ted 50 bucks)                          Okay, mister, here s your fifty-dollar                           tip, only, you have to do one more                           thing... make our little Eva smile.                           Can you? We ll leave you alone.                               (to Eva, firmly)                          And don t use your mouth!                 The girls step out. Athena turns to Eva and points to her                 watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The                 door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He                 covers her with a shawl.                 IN THE HALLWAY                 The other witches listen at the door.                                       ELSPETH                          If she doesn t get his goop in ten                           minutes, I m going to take him myself.                                       JEZEBEL                          Ha! That ll be a first for you.                                       ELSPETH                          Oh shit -- Kiva!                 She runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already                 sneaking out the bedroom door.

We meet back                 here in one hour and let s all have faith that Eva can get                 this guy off.                 The witches disperse.                 INT. HONEYMOON SUITE--NIGHT                 Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in                 front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile.                 But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.                                       TED                          Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this                           fifty bucks!                                       EVA                          Oh look, they don t care if I smile                           or not! All they want is...                 Ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.                                       EVA                          You won t understand, believe me.                 She begins to cry tearfully again.                                       TED                          Try me. I ve been around, y know.                 He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him                 helplessly.

ELSPETH                          No. And virtually no cervical cancer,                           either.                                       ATHENA                          Okay, girls, enough Sex Education                           101, let s get going with our ritual,                           goddammit.                 Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts                 again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we                 see black bondage tape on her nipples. Elspeth darts a quick                 look at the tape, looks at the other witches -- not sure she                 likes this -- but she goes with it. The witches sway in a                 circle, eyes closed, as Eva makes her offering.                                       EVA                          Goddess Diana, I offer you The jism                           of one I wooed for you That you may                           live and know such bliss Of getting                           laid by a guy like this.                 The witches all incant.                                       ALL OF THE WITCHES                          So must it be. Three times three                           times three.                 They march half-naked as they moan and revel in eerie cries.                 The Jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil. Their cries heighten;                 the potion bubbles over.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 HOURS LATER                 Athena reads from a huge leatherbound book, The Book of                 Shadows, full of potions and spells. Four discouraged witches                 pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly                 under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much                 for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab.

They pick up their bags and head out.                                       JEZEBEL                               (cuddling her cat)                          I can t believe we have to carry our                           own bags out!

Jezebel s cat leaps from her arms as                 she hoists her luggage. Eva walks out satisfied, thought                 perhaps a little sore --  ouch,  she says, and smiles. Athena                 takes one last look at their goddess slab.

After a moment, the latch is thrown                 and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark                 room.                 INT.

At the other end of the gun stands                 a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile                 and a  just try fuckin  with me  look on his face.

Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of                 assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like                 they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward,                 gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                               (to Angela)                          I am an upset man, Theodore.                                       TED                          How do you know my name, sir?                                       SIGFRIED                          I m psychic, Theodore.                                       TED                          Look my name is Ted, actually, and I                           have no idea what s going on here,                           but I ve obviously come at a bad                           time.                                       SIGFRIED                          Let s not belabor the fact that you                           have no sense of timing, Theodore.                           The fact is you re here.                 Sigfried turns to Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          And I couldn t think of a better                           time for you to introduce me to your                           beau than on New Year s Eve.                                       TED                          Oh fuck, there s a mistake. You re                           fucking wrong here. My name is                           Theodore, yes! My mother named me                           that and I hate the name. But I m a                           fucking bellhop. People call me Ted.                           I work here.                 Suddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his                 pistol smack into Ted s temple, sending him to the floor.                 Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock.                                       SIGFRIED                          Look, I d love to sit here all night                           with you talking about things like                           when you broke in your first mitt --                               (pause)                          That was insensitive of me, wasn t                           it, T H E O D O R E? But let s cut                           to the chase, okay?                                       TED                          Okay.                                       SIGFRIED                          So apologize!                 A tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who                 can t figure out what the fuck this guy wants.                                       TED                          For what?                 Sigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back.                                       SIGFRIED                          You are really beginning to annoy                           me, Theodore.                 Sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.                                       TED                          Look, obviously you two are working                           something out and if I could help                           you with your problem I would.                                       SIGFRIED                          What are you saying? Are you saying                           I got a problem? Are you trying to                           say I don t give her what she needs?                           That I m FUCKING INSENSITIVE!!                                       TED                          Look, is this about another man? Or                           something?                 Ted has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried s mood swings                 drastically; he bends down next to Ted.                                       SIGFRIED                          Let s get our ABC s right, here,                           Theodore. Theodore, right?                                       TED                          Ted s better.                                       SIGFRIED                          Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife                           cheats on me?                                       TED                          I didn t say that... I...                                       SIGFRIED                          Oh, for Christ s sake, Theodore,                           this is about as intimate a situation                           as you can get, you, me, and Angela                           here. It s pretty cozy. To say nothing                           of how stupid an idea it is to lie                           to a man with a loaded gun without                           considering the possible response. I                           demand an apology!                 The phone rings.                                       SIGFRIED                          Don t move. I ve got to take this.                 Sigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone.                                       SIGFRIED                               (into phone)                          What?                               (pause)                          We ain t got any needles here, kid.                           Just a big fucking gun.                 He listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up.                                       SIGFRIED                               (to Ted)                          Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember.                 Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position.                                       SIGFRIED                          I want you to pray for forgiveness,                           Theodore.                 Sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the                 same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move,                 but thinks better of it. Sigfried s eyes pop open. He cuts a                 look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Now say after me,  I apologize...                                        TED                          I apologize...                                       SIGFRIED                          For what?                 Ted looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with                 intense, wide-open eyes.                                       SIGFRIED                          For fucking what?                                       TED                          That I said you might have been                           unfaithful?                                       SIGFRIED                           That I said you might have been                           unfaithful?  Listen, Theodore, you re                           in church here... you re kneeling in                           front of an altar. Truth... truth is                           all it hears. Say the following,  I,                           Theodore, must humbly and sincerely                           apologize for saying that you fucked                           another man!                  Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have                 a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor,                 turning his face to Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Satisfied?                 Angela nods.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Do you accept the fucking apology?                 Naturally, Angela says nothing.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          You always gotta get the last word,                           don t you? It s one way with you,                           Angela, isn t it? I give and I give                           and I get nothing back.                 Sigfried turns to Ted.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          She just sits there waiting for me                           to jump through hoops...                 Angela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with                 bated breath for a response. Sigfried s had enough.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Stupid me, for a second I thought                           you were going to say something...                           something like,  I m sorry.  HA!                            I m sorry.  You re absolutely right,                           love cakes, I wouldn t want it that                           way. That s one thing you can say                           about Angela. She ll never do anything                           she doesn t want to do. If the feeling                           ain t there, she just isn t going to                           do it. There is nothing in this world                           as fucked as a woman who gives when                           she doesn t want to. Never let that                           happen to you, Theodore. It makes                           you feel very little indeed.                 Ted beckons Sigfried.                                       TED                          You mind if I...?                                       SIGFRIED                          Go ahead. Spit it out.                                       TED                          I don t mean to upset you further,                           sir, but I think she was trying to                           say yes.                                       SIGFRIED                          Are you condescending to me, Theodore?                                       TED                          Absolutely not, I would never do                           that.                                       SIGFRIED                          Why don t you just say it?                                       TED                          Say what?                                       SIGFRIED                          That you think I m an idiot.                                       TED                          I would never say that.                                       SIGFRIED                          You think you re superior to me,                           don t ya, Theodore? You don t think                           I notice there is a gag in the woman s                           mouth.                                       TED                          Of course you do.                                       SIGFRIED                          Naturally  of course.  And do you                           know how I know that?                                       TED                          How, sir?                                       SIGFRIED                          Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH!                           I m gonna let you in on a little                           secret about communication, Theodore.                           It s all in the eyes...                               (points the gun at                                Ted)                          Him?                               (turns the gun on                                himself)                          Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let s                           drag it out.                 Sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving                 the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing                 into the bathroom.                 INT. ROOM                 Ted finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela                 implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation:                 His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the                 fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted                 paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to                 get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what                 appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point                 and cautiously removes the gag from Angela s mouth. Angela                 spits an old sock out.                                       TED                          What!

TED                          Listen, lady, I don t know what in                           the hell is going on here, but I d                           appreciate it if you would explain                           to that nutcase that he s making a                           big mistake.

TED                          But I ve never seen you people before,                           we re complete strangers.

Ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie Angela or                 not.                                       TED                          I don t know if I can do this. It s                           too hard.                                       ANGELA                          Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped                           to consider how many times you change                           your underwear in a lifetime?                 On nervous impulse, Ted begins the calculations.                                       ANGELA                          I don t mean literally, you ignoramus.

There s a                           gun in my suitcase behind the bed,                           it s loaded...

Get the gun and I ll shoot                            anybody.                                        TED                          And make me an accessory in the murder                           of your husband?                 Ted collapses to his knees in front of Angela.                                       TED                          That s not fair. It just isn t fair.

Well,                           maybe there are two sides to this                           thing.                                       ANGELA                          There are two sides to a plate, still                           you only eat off of one. Now GET THE                           GUN!                                       TED                          So why s he got you tied up?                                       ANGELA                          I m a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun!                 Ted is at a loss as to what to do. Angela turns on the charm.                                       ANGELA                          Come on, Ted. Come over here just                           for a minute. You can do it. Come                           on, Ted. You look like a good guy.                 Ted creeps towards her.                                       ANGELA                          That s it, Teddy. You look so much                           more attractive when you re self-                          assured.                 Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He s heard from the                 bathroom belting out  Life is but a dream... she-boom, she-                boom.                                        ANGELA                               (she panics)                          Quick, he s coming back. Put the gag                           back in, and remember the gun!                 Ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth.                                       TED                          Nine thousand, three hundred and                           twenty-two times, to the best of my                           estimation.                 INT. ROOM                 Sigfried coughs, sending a chill up Ted s spine. Ted whips                 around to discover Sigfried leaning up against the door to                 the bathroom.                                       SIGFRIED                          I was just beginning to think I could                           trust you, Theodore. Silly me.                 Ted s fingers are frozen over Angela s lips.                                       TED                          I was just trying to help her breathe                           a little.                                       SIGFRIED                          Don t let me stop you, Teddy. You                           don t mind me calling you Teddy, do                           you?                                       TED                          That s fine.                                       SIGFRIED                          I used to have a little bunny rabbit                           named Teddy, it looked real cute                           nibbling on Angela s ear. Only problem                           here is you re no bunny rabbit,                           Theodore, and it really fuckin  razzes                           me to picture you doin  it. But don t                           let me stop you, Teddy... no need to                           play sneaky-poo.                 Ted starts to back toward the door.                                       TED                          Look, man, if this is some kind of                           Voodoo thing and you want me to have                           sex with your wife, there is                           absolutely no way.                                       SIGFRIED                               (shouts at the top of                                his lungs)                          I said, nibble, asshole! Now!                 The directness of Sigfried s command, coupled with the SOUND                 of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela.                 Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy                 makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he                 closes in, Angela s eyes close.                                       TED                               (whispers)                          Sorry, lady.                 Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                          What s the matter, no whiz left in                           the cheese? I m not cramping your                           style, am I?                                       TED                          Look, I m not playing this game                           anymore.                 Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him.                                       SIGFRIED                          It s almost all over, Theodore, and                           soon you can go home to Mommy.                 Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried s powerful bear                 hug and blasts out the following monologue.                                       TED                          My name is not Theodore, it s TED,                           TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT                           TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes,                           my mother did me the service of naming                           me Theodore and I haven t a clue as                           to how you know that because everyone                           who knows that lives a long way away                           from here. Do you have any idea what                           it s like to go to school where all                           the other kids  parents are in jail                           doing time for crimes like grand                           larceny, aggravated assault, burglary                           and murder, and you get stuck with a                           mother who names you Theodore and                           dressed you up in little matching                           pink outfits with, get this, a little                           blue bow fucking tie! Well, I ll                           tell you what happens. Pretty soon                           Theodore becomes  Theo the Thumper,                            and when Theo the Thumper gets old                           enough, he packs his bags and goes                           thousands of miles away where he can                           put the whole bloody mess behind                           him. So, if you don t mind, shoot me                           now, because no one is going to call                           me that again. My name is Ted, okay?                           Got it? TED!                 Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence.                 He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand.                                       SIGFRIED                          Sigfried.                                       TED                          What?                                       SIGFRIED                          My name is Sigfried.                                       TED                          Sigfried?                 Sigfried cuts a  Something wrong with that?  look at Ted.                                       SIGFRIED                          Yah, Sigfried.                                       TED                          Nice to meet you, Sigfried.                 Ted cautiously takes Sigfried s hand.                                       SIGFRIED                          Very impressive, Ted.  Theo the                           Thumper? ... Ouch. It s a deal, kid.                           Ted it will be.                                       TED                          Thanks.                 Sigfried holds onto Ted s hand. The soft sound of distant                 fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled                 countdown signal that it s New Year s.                 Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of                 nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted s                 mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really                 getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure.                 He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he                 flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all                 over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve                 while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.                                       TED                          You okay, mister? I ll get help!                 Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at                 Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          That s the wrong door, sir.                 Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the                 gun into his crotch.                 Sigfried pulls Ted s face closer to his.                                       SIGFRIED                          Get me the nitro... it s in the                           bathroom cabinet. Now!                 Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling                 mess behind.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME                 Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an                 earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place.                 An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills                 are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to                 hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked                  Nitro.  No luck.                 Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.                 He figures this is the best chance he s got to make a break.                 Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm                 through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in                 the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-                bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the                 apartment.                                       SIGFRIED (O.S.)                               (shouting in the                                distance)                          It s no time to take a leak, Teddy,                           I m fucking dying here!                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT                 Outside the window, Ted s in another world. He s almost safe.                 It s a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water                 in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass                 off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the                 witches  room from the floor below.                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT                 Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her                 name out, to no avail.                 The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for                 help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang                 there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have                 found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably                 everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody                 hand print. It s not his blood.                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT                 Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around,                 spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag                 on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him.                 After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.                                       TED                          Hi...                 No answer. Something s wrong with the guy, all the blood is                 drained from his face and he is mumbling something.                                       TED                          Listen, I m stuck here in a situation                           that I can t even begin to explain,                           but would you be so kind as to get                           help? Could you call the police,                           please?                 Silence.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          You okay?                 The young man manages to belt out the word  ice  just before                 hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted s                 strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the                 bathroom. He falls back on the floor.                 He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices                 something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks                 into the bedroom.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER                 Ted looks around the still room. No one s there.                                       TED                          Sigfried?                 He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his                 eye, he spots Sigfried s hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out                 on the floor. Angela s chair has been knocked on its side.                 Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag                 from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.                                       ANGELA                          Where s the fucking nitro?                                       TED                          I couldn t find it!                                       ANGELA                          You took long enough. Untie me, for                           Christ s sake, you fucking upset him                           and he s dying.                 Ted struggles to untie Angela.                                       TED                          I thought you wanted to kill him.                                       ANGELA                          You d make a great cop, Theodore.                 The knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.                                       TED                          I can t handle this alone, I d better                           get help.                 Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who s been                 taking in the whole conversation.                                       SIGFRIED                          I tie a pretty good knot, don t I,                           Ted?                                       TED                          Thank God you re okay...                                       SIGFRIED                          Never felt better.                 Angela hears Sigfried s voice from behind her back.                                       ANGELA                          You bastard!                                       SIGFRIED                               (to Angela)                          Come on, honey, don t get mad. It                           was just a little test, and I m glad                           I did it because now I ll know forever                           that you really do love me. Truly                           and deeply.                                       ANGELA                          If the simple fact that I didn t                           want your bloated, dead body lying                           out on the floor is love, then no                           wonder we find ourselves as we are                           at this very fucking moment.                                       SIGFRIED                          Oh, no. I heard you and there was                           genuine care in that voice. Can t be                           denied. Can it, Ted?                                       TED                          I think you re right and, if you                           just keep this kind of open dialogue                           going, you ll go a long way to                           resolving this misunderstanding.                 Ted edges his way toward the door.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          You d be surprised what happens when                           people just listen to each other                           without succumbing to all that pain                           and anger.                                       ANGELA                          You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for                           you to say after you fuck another                           man s wife. You should at least have                           the guts to stand by your convictions.                 Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope                 of ever getting out of the room.                                       TED                          That s a lie, Sigfried. I swear to                           God.                 Angela continues her tirade.                                       ANGELA                          When I think of all the times you                           were inside me promising me a better                           life, it makes me want to puke.                 Sigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at Ted s                 chest.                                       TED                          Why are you doing this? What have I                           ever done to you people?                                       ANGELA                          What didn t you do, stick man?                           Unfortunately, you don t have the                           balls to back up the actions of your                           huge cock.                 The words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs                 weaken.                                       SIGFRIED                               (whimpering)                          He s got a huge cock?                                       TED                          She s lying again, mister. It s not                           that big.                                       SIGFRIED                          Show it to me.                                       TED                          Come on, man, she s lying. Can t you                           see she s fucking with you?                                       ANGELA                          Put it this way, God made up for                           what he did to Gumby with Ted here.                                       SIGFRIED                          Show it to me.                                       ANGELA                          Show him your cock, Theodore.                 Sigfried runs over to Angela and kneels in front of her.                                       SIGFRIED                          Stop talking about his cock, will                           you?!                                       ANGELA                          It s hard to stop talking about                           something so huge. I could go on and                           on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop,                           wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile,                           Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber,                           salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong,                           dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy,                           prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee,                           wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol,                           joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third-                          leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.                 Angela is on a roll. She fires the words at Sigfried, hitting                 him pointblank. He staggers. He pleads with her to stop,                 covering his ears. Ted watches the man crumble.                                       ANGELA                               (continuing)                          Junior, the little head, little guy,                           Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake,                           one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder,                           shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin                           flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter,                           instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod,                           cherrypicker, log, pole.                 Sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop                 the flow; she manages to give him a  fuck of a bite  in the                 process. Meanwhile, Ted figures this to be his moment to                 make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by                 Sigfried at the one-yard line. After a struggle, the two men                 rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.                                       SIGFRIED                          Please, don t leave me. I ll call                           you Ted from now on.                                       TED                          It s not me, mister, I swear.                                       SIGFRIED                          Personally, I don t give a fuck,                           Ted, it s just I don t want to be                           alone right now. I m feeling a little                           vulnerable.                 Sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half-empty                 bottle of Jack Daniel s, and passes it to Ted, who takes a                 hit.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted.                           You know my father used to say that                           forgiveness is the only thing that                           evil can t sink its teeth into.

TED                          What?                                       SIGFRIED                          What was it like?                                       TED                          What was what like?                                       SIGFRIED                          You know, you and her.                                       TED                          Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do                           you want me to say?                                       SIGFRIED                          Either way you re fucked, right? You                           ever gonna see her again, Theodore?                                       TED                          If I ever saw her again, I d run the                           other way.                                       SIGFRIED                          Promise?                                       TED                          I promise.                 Sigfried releases Ted and stands up.                                       SIGFRIED                          You re lying, but I can respect that,                           Ted. If you told me, it would no                           longer be a secret, and secrets have                           a power, kid. You open that box and                           they disappear forever. A bad secret                           will rip you apart, but the good one                           are all you got. In the end, when                           all the people you knew are dead and                           gone, all you ll have left are you                           secrets. And when you die, the box                           is open and it all blows away --                           dust to dust -- all the anger,                           jealousy, desire and love just blow                           away.                 Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          So you know what I say, let s call                           it a truce, kiddo.                 Sigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open                 window. Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfried s voice                 and follows him to the window willingly.                 The two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          I m a man of love, Theodore. Love is                           all I live for.                                       TED                          I can see that.                                       SIGFRIED                          Maybe to a fault.                                       TED                          Don t beat yourself up over it.                                       SIGFRIED                          That s nice of you to say, Ted, but                           I probably should make a clean break                           of it, cut her loose and get my own                           place. I just can t imagine living                           without her. Do you think I should                           seek professional help?                                       TED                          It s not for everyone, but maybe in                           your case it could help.                                       SIGFRIED                          You ever been out on the ocean at                           night?                 Ted shakes his head.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          I have... scary as a motherfucker,                           all that darkness around you. It s                           like a big black carpet rolled out                           as far as the eye can see. Sometimes,                           if you re lucky, you ll see a light.                           It could be as small as a little                           spark, but it will cut a path straight                           through all that blackness, straight                           to you. It could be another boat, or                           some distant fire on an island, but                           that light will shed a shining path                           of diamonds cutting through mile                           after mile of darkness to lie at                           your feet. That s love, Ted, it s                           like a path of light in an ocean of                           darkness.                 Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed                 by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out,                 shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela                 stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.                 Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood.                 Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up                 at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands                 the bullets to Ted.                                       ANGELA                               (to Ted)                          You d better go check to see if I                           killed anybody downstairs.                 Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.                                       TED                          You people gonna be okay?                 Angela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back.                                       ANGELA                          We re fine, Ted.                 Ted points to a tray with half-eaten food on it.                                       TED                          Would you like me to...?                                       ANGELA                          Another time, Ted.                 Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at                 the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before                 closing the door behind him.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER                 Ted walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic                 Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him.                                       YOUNG GUY                          Happy New Year, buddy.                                       TED                          Happy New Year.                                       YOUNG GUY                          I was just in room 404, what a party!                           You know where room 409 is at?                                       TED                          Beats me. It s somewhere around here.                 The guy takes off in the direction Ted s walking from. Ted                 suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting                 to the Young Guy.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          Hey, what s your name?                 The door SLAMS on room 409.                 FADE OUT                 FADE TO BLACK                 STORY TITLE CARD:                                           ROOM 716                                      THE MISBEHAVERS                  FADE UP                 THE FRONT DESK                 SUPER: 10:30 p.m.                 Ted is relaxing at the front desk. He breathes slowly. He                 finally has one moment s peace after an already long night.                 He even has a chance to straighten his tie.                 The phone RINGS.                                       TED                          Front desk.                                                                      CUT TO:                 ROOM 716                 CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man s mouth as he                 speaks into the telephone.                                       MAN                          Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.                 Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an                 already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to                 face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his                 mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.                 He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his                 tie.                 He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife                 and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a                 beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine,                 and Juancho, six.                 Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.                 He watches his Wife comb Juancho s hair down and to the side                 like an idiot.                 Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away                 from his Wife and snatches the comb.                                       MAN                          Give me that...                 Man begins to slick Juancho s hair back.                                       MAN                          There... see? You look cool with                           your hair up like this. Like me...                 Juancho is smiling now. He s happy he s going to look like                 his dad.                                       MAN                          Not down and to the side, all stupid                           like your mom likes to comb it.                 Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous                 ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her                 long, unmanageable hair.                 Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled                 mess.                 Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho s                 hair. Juancho s hair is thinner than Man s, so it won t stay                 up.                 Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle                 on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.                 Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he s smoking                 too, just like his dad.                 Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down                 to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down                 at Juancho s, which won t stay up.                 Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration.                                        MAN                          You ve got your mother s hair.                 In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho s hair.                                       MAN                          I can t do anything with it.                 Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho s hair back down and to                 the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an                 idiot again.                                       MAN                          There. Go.                 Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.                 Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.                                       WIFE                               (putting a plastic                                clip in Sarah s hair)                          There. Go.                 Sarah exits.                 Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a                 new cigarette.                                       WIFE                               (mocking)                          So, are we gonna have fun tonight?                 Man blows smoke in Wife s face as he walks out of the                 bathroom.                                       WIFE                          I didn t think so.                 Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.                 Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels                 turning in Man s head.                 He turns back to the bathroom.                 He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning                 rubber.                                       MAN                          Hey.                 Wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband. She is                 beautiful.                                       MAN                               (shrugs)                          Let s just leave the kids here.                 Wife glances out at the children, eyes glued to the tube.                                       WIFE                          Here in the room? By themselves?                                       MAN                          No... with the television.                 Wife thinks about it for a second. She shrugs a  sure.                                        MAN                          You want to have fun tonight, don t                           you?                                       WIFE                          Yes.                                       MAN                          They ll be fine.                 He kisses Wife s face and exits the bathroom. She covers the                 wet spot with more cake makeup.                                       MAN                          Hey.                 The children turn to face him.                                       MAN                          You guys are going to stay here and                           watch TV.                 The children look at each other.                                       MAN                          I want you to be in bed asleep before                           twelve. Your mother and I will be                           back later on.                 Wife goes straight for the door.                                       MAN                          Okay?                 He blows one kiss. One for both of them.                 As Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the                 children...                                       MAN                          Don t misbehave.                 He closes the door.                 Sarah stands in the middle of the room. She s looking at the                 door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.                 Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She                 touches the edges of the fabric.                                       SARAH                          Why did we have to get all dressed                           up if we weren t going with them?

They wait.                                                                      CUT TO:                 ROOM 716                 Juancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the                 floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps                 to the window and begins unlatching it.                                       SARAH                          What are you doing?                                       JUANCHO                          Escaping. Stinks in here, anyway.                 Man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in                 the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho.                 Juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back                 inside. He leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the TV                 with the remote.                                       MAN                               (stern)                          What did I say?                 Juancho turns to Man as if he d been sitting there watching                 television the whole time.

Ted appears at the door with Man s champagne.                                       TED                          The champagne you ordered, sir.                                       MAN                          No time for this. Leave it on ice.                 Ted proceeds to place the champagne in the room.                                       WIFE                          But I want some now...                 Ted is torn. Man pushes him into the room.                                       MAN                          There ll be plenty for you and the                           party, baby, you can bomb yourself                           all you want at the party.                                       WIFE                          What a waste.                 Ted places the bucket near the bed. After setting up the                 bottle, he turns to leave, but now Man closes the door,                 trapping Ted inside with them.

TED                          No, you distinctly said five hundred.                 The angrier Man gets, the quieter he talks.                                       MAN                          You calling me a liar?                 Ted, while not backing down, massages the situation.

Ted not only doesn t back down, but psychologically pokes                 his finger in the scary Man s chest.                                       TED                          Well then, if you say five hundred                           one last time, we got a deal.                 Man s eyes narrow. He physically pokes his finger in Ted s                 chest.                                       MAN                          You fuckin  with me, Pendejo?

You win, tough guy, five hundred.                 Man respects Ted for not backing down, but not insulting him                 either. A skill Man never learned. Wife shoots a look at the                 children.

If you need anything,                           dial 0 and ask for Ted.                 Sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it:  TED --                 BELLHOP.                  Sarah looks up at Ted. She clips the pin to her dress and                 smiles shyly at him.                 Man puts the money in Ted s pocket and then grabs his ear,                 pulling him close.

CLOSE ON the shoes and socks.                 Sarah looks over at Juancho s bare feet. Her nose twitches.                                       SARAH                          Your feet stink.                 Juancho smells his feet.                                       JUANCHO                          They don t stink.                 Sarah throws his shoes and socks behind her. They land on                 the bed.                 Juancho is flipping channels and finds an interesting show.                                       JUANCHO                          Check it out. T & A.                 Sarah realizes he found a Nudie station.                                       SARAH                          Change it.

SARAH                          Not this kind of TV. Change it.                 Juancho rolls up in a ball, the remote tucked in some recess                 of his stomach.                 Sarah hits him, then goes to the phone. She punches 0, sits                 on the bed, and checks the name on the name tag pinned to                 her shirt.

She has an unusually adult                 temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and                 sees that the nudies are still in full force.                                       SARAH                          Change the channel, now!                 Juancho turns around. He has a face like someone just laid a                 fart in his nose.                                       JUANCHO                          Man, you re the one with the stinky                           feet.                 Sarah smells her feet. Twice.                                       SARAH                          They don t stink.                                       JUANCHO                          Yeah, they do.                                       SARAH                          Here, smell for yourself.                 She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He s reluctant.                 Fearful.                                       SARAH                          Go ahead.                 He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his                 head to her foot. Very slowly.                 Sarah waits until he s close enough to her foot before she                 kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed                 and crashing to the floor.                 She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the                 channel to a cartoon.                 Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander                 about. Looking for something to do...                 Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It s only a                 matter of time before he finds mischief.                 Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for                 the bottle.                                       JUANCHO                               (holding up the bottle)                          Hey, get a bottle opener!                 Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the                 champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she                 wants some champagne too.                 She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho                 unwraps the bottle top.                 Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few                 hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer                 slide forward.                 Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks                 down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and                 casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone                 rings.                 FRONT DESK                 Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room                 404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at                 the board and see room 716 s light blinking.                 He sighs in exasperation.                 INT. ROOM                 Sarah sees Juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently.                                       SARAH                          Don t shake it!

Then don t                           call me.                                       SARAH                          I thought I d tell you that your                           cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.                           There s all kinds of leftover stuff                           around here.                 Sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand                 several times.                                       SARAH                          Needles and things. We re not supposed                           to have needles here, are we? I mean,                           they don t come with the room, do                           they? Send someone up here to clean                           this place up right.                 The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks                 surprised.                                       SARAH                               (to Juancho)                          I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!                               (to Ted)                          I gotta go. My brother just exploded                           the champagne all over the room. Oh,                           and bring us a couple of toothbrushes.                           There s a card in the bathroom that                           says you ll bring free toothbrushes                           if we ask for them.                 She hangs up.                 A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the                 elevator.                 Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They                 turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the                 taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.                 Sarah clearly doesn t like it, but tries to pretend she does.                 Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how                 to make room-to-room calls.                                       SARAH                          I m calling another room, give me                           three numbers.                                       JUANCHO                          4-0-9.                 Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.                 She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.                                       SARAH                          Hello? Hi. You don t know me, and I                           don t know you, but... do you have                           any needles? We ve got needles here                           and I was wondering if they come                           with the room or not. Don t have                           any? Thanks. Just checking.                 She hangs up.                 Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his                 father s coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes                 one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.                 Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an                 idea.                 MONTAGE:                 In the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother s lipstick.                 ROOM 716                 Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick                 to draw a bull s-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She                 writes numbers next to each circle representing points.                 Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging                 out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.                                       SARAH                               (pointing out the                                rules)                          The center is the bull s eye, 100                           points, this one s 10 points, this                           one s 20 points.                 WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point                 slot.                                       SARAH                          Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out                           of the way!                 Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to                 the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the                 needle into the curtain to hide it.                 Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter                 with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.                 He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots                 the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping                 into the carpet.                                       TED                          I brought you some milk and cookies.                           If you want some you have to eat                           them now, because you re going to                           sleep.                                       SARAH                          We re going to sleep now?                                       TED                          Your parents said put you to bed                           before midnight. Well, it s before                           midnight. Maybe that way you ll leave                           me alone.                                       SARAH                          Those aren t milk and cookies.                                       TED                          We were out of cookies, so I brought                           you milk and Saltines. Don t complain!                           Now hurry up and eat. You re going                           to bed right now.                 Juancho bites into a Saltine. Sarah simply examines one.                                       JUANCHO                          These are old.                                       SARAH                          They re stale.

Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray.                 She s a little drunk.                 Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.                 Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and                 drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.                                       TED                          No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time.                           Now, I don t want you guys wandering                           around, so if you need to go to the                           restroom, go now.                 They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.                 He sees the painting on the wall but can t figure out what s                 different about it.                 The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of                 the painting.                 Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks                 on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to                 throw the socks across the room.                 The kids come back out.                                       JUANCHO                          What about our pajamas?

TED                          Okay. Then stay in those clothes.                 The kids lie on the bed.                 Sarah notices a jar of Mentholatum ointment on the dinner                 tray.                                       SARAH                          What s that?                                       TED                          Oh, this is just some Mentholatum                           ointment. Come on, under the covers.                           Close your eyes and I ll tell you a                           story.                 The children close their eyes. Ted opens the jar of the                 ointment and sniffs it.                 Strong stuff by the look on his face.                                       TED                          Your dad says he doesn t trust                           babysitters. I don t blame him. You                           know what my babysitter did to me                           once?                               (confiding)                          I never told my parents, either.                 The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.                 Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.                                       TED                          I hated going to sleep.

So what my                           babysitter did to make sure I d go                           to sleep and not be tempted to get                           up, was, she d take some of this                           vapor rub stuff... Can you smell                           this?                 Eyes closed, the kids inhale. They smell the ointment and                 nod yes.                                       TED                          Well, she d just dab a little of                           this over each eyelid, so that I                           would be sure and keep my eyes closed                           all night.                 Ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says                 this.                                       TED                          There.

The smell helps clear                           your sinuses too, so it s doing double                           duty.

Sleep                           well and I won t tell your parents                           about the champagne.                 Ted leaves.                                                                      CUT TO:                 AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS                 After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the                 loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.                 Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming                 from the window and she tilts her head toward it.                 The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her                 face.                 She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for                 the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets                 to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the                 sink.                 She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully.                 She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them                 in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.                 She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and                 grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.                 Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still                 closed.                                       JUANCHO                          Are you watching TV?                 The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.                                       SARAH                          Yep. If you wanna watch too, you                           have to go wash your face.                 Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He                 slams into the wall, hard.                                       SARAH                          Be careful...                 Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more                 cautious.                 Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and                 shudders.                 She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells                 it.                 She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne.                 Nothing.                 Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his                 foot and smells it.                 She drops his foot.                 Juancho stares blankly at her.                 Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.                 Juancho looks at her as if she s drunk.                 Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She                 takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks                 toward the mattress.                 Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.                 Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see                 what is underneath it.                 Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed                 into the bedsprings is a woman s dead and beaten corpse.

Thinking.                 Juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous                 puffs.                 Sarah carries the phone over to Juancho and snatches the                 cigarette away from him.

You!                 FRONT DESK                 Ted slams down the phone.                 As he walks away from the counter, he spots the children s                 parents driving up to the valet out front.                                       TED                          Oh shit!                 Ted breaks into a sprint and dives into a closing elevator.                                                                      CUT TO:                 ROOM 716                 Sarah continues to cover the body with the mattress.                 ELEVATOR                 Close on Ted s face as the elevator car races up seven floors.                 LOBBY                 The Man is carrying his drunk Wife through the lobby. Not                 happy.                 ROOM 716                 Ted bursts into the room. He sees the disarray.                 Ted pushes the champagne out of Sarah s hand, spilling it                 onto the floor.                                       TED                          What the fuck is going on??!!                 He sees Juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth                 and rips it away from him. The butt goes flying onto the                 carpet near the spreading champagne spill.

TED                          It s your feet!                 Sarah grabs the mattress and pulls it off herself.                 Ted sees the rotting corpse.                 Vomit spews out of Ted s mouth.

Tears well in Sarah s eyes as she looks at the body.                                       SARAH                          Don t call her that...

SARAH                          Stop calling her that!!                 Sarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and                 stabs it into Ted s leg.                                       TED                          FUCK!!                 Sarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle.                 She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted                 tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle                 sticking out of his leg.                                       TED                          Jesus!!                 Juancho lights up another cigarette.                 The champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt.                 The carpet bursts into flames around the spill.                                                              CUT OUTSIDE TO:                 EXT. ROOM                 CLOSE ON a key going into the keyhole outside.                                                                     BACK TO:                 ROOM 716                 Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it                 makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle                 still stuck in his leg.                 Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman s foot for                 support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV                 on to the Nudie channel, just as...                 Man opens the door.                 Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm,                 the door knob in the other hand. He s looking mean.                 Man s POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We                 pan up the dead woman s leg to find Ted holding her foot. We                 pan down Ted s leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting                 out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken                 syringe plunger.                 We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire                 blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne                 bottle in Sarah s hand, then over to the cigarette hanging                 out of Juancho s mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of                 his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts                 immediately.                 Man drops his Wife to the floor.                 In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the                 fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window                 behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through                 the room.                 Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...                                       MAN                          Did they misbehave?                 Ted stares blankly at Man (the camera) as the sprinklers                 burst on... drenching the room as the picture                 FADES TO BLACK                                          FOUR ROOMS                 FADE UP ON                 INT.

The doors open and a                 wet, disheveled, and frantic Ted steps out.                 He staggers across the lobby to the reception desk. He grabs                 the phone.                 INT. BETTY S APT--ALMOST DAWN                 The wild New Year s Eve party is winding down.

But it was                           still an unnerving way to start off                           the night.

MARGARET                          Did it have a real long barrel or a                           short barrel?                                       TED                          What difference does it make?                                       MARGARET                          Well, for one thing it s the                           difference between a .44 Magnum and                           a Magnum .357.                                       TED                          Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392,                           it was a fuckin  loaded gun, pointed                           at my fuckin  head!

Betty wakes up from the floor.                                       BETTY                          Yeah, whatcha screamin  about?

Betty takes the phone.                                       BETTY                          Ted, what s the problem?

TED                          Well, most recently, there s room                           716. There s a scary Mexican gangster                           dude pokin  his finger in my chest.                           There s his hooligan kids snapping                           their fingers at me. There s the                           putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore                           stuffed in the springs of a bed.                           There re rooms blazing afire...                           There s a needle from God knows where                           stuck in my leg, infecting me with                           God knows what, and finally, there s                           me walking out the fuckin  door right                           now! Buenas noches.                 A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven t heard before. Ted s                 head turns toward it.                 It s the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is                 ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.                 Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The                 sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks                 style again.                                       BETTY                               (suddenly alert)                          Is that the penthouse?                                       TED                          Yeah.                                       BETTY                          That s the Chester Rush party, they                           want something.

BETTY                               (panicking)                          Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you re                           freaked, I know you re stressed.

TED                          Yes, I did.                                       BETTY                          No problem, this is a hotel, we ve                           had dead bodies before, it s just                           the price of doing business. You                           said the hotel was on fire. Is it                           still on fire?                                       TED                          No, it s out.                                       BETTY                          Good, sprinkler system worked like a                           charm. Now, you wanna leave, you ve                           had enough. Perfectly understandable.                           I ll take care of everything else.                           The only thing I ask is that you                           take care of Chester Rush. Then you                           can leave.                                       TED                          Now, look --                                       BETTY                          Ted, he s a very important guest of                           this hotel. In fact, he is the most                           important guest at the hotel. The                           Mon Signor used to be a haven for                           movie stars. Through the thirties                           and forties, and the first half of                           the fifties, more movie stars -- if                           you break it down on a night-by-night                           basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor                           than any other hotel in Hollywood.                           Now, we had some hard time in the                           eighties, even though we were the                           official hotel of Cannon Pictures,                           but we re coming back strong in the                           nineties. And a movie star clientele                           is important to that comeback. If we                           can keep stars of his magnitude happy,                           we re on our way. So, Ted, just take                           care of him, then you can leave.                                       TED                          Look, I don t feel like --                                       BETTY                          He probably just wants some champagne!                           You can do that, can t you? Please                           just take care of him, the entire                           staff of the Mon Signor is begging                           you!                 Ted crumbles.                                       TED                          Okay. But get your ass here pronto.                                       BETTY                          You re a good man, Ted. Thanks.                 Ted hangs up the phone. And picks up the board phone.                                       TED                          Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay.                           How can I help you?                 FADE TO BLACK                 STORY TITLE CARD:                                        THE PENTHOUSE                                   THE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD                  EXT. HALLWAY TO PENTHOUSE--NIGHT                 The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the                 hallway.                 There s been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit                 less disheveled than in the last scene. He s only minorly                 successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit,                 his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.                 He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at                 the door.                 A woman opens the door, it s Angela from Alex s story.                                       ANGELA                          Hi, Theodore.                                       TED                          What the hell are you doing here?                 She holds up the drink she has in her hand.                                       ANGELA                          Having a drink.

ANGELA                          Are you kidding, he ll be asleep                           till Christmas.                 From behind her we hear:                                       VOICE (O.S.)                          Entrez, entrez.                 Angela steps aside and Ted wheels in the tray.                 INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT                 The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the                 house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the                 hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the                 Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this                 moment in time, he s the king, and he has the swagger of a                 new king. After only one movie, he s pulled the sword out of                 the stone. And the look on his face says,  King s good.                  Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once                 upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however,                 at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as                 Ted.                 One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair                 with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in                 his hand.                 The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back                 and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to                 the rest of the room s activity.                 In Chester s hand is an ever present glass of champagne,                 which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the                 room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers,                 and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.

TED                          Actually, it s not Theodore,                               (he throws a look at                                Angela)                          It s Ted.                 Chester rises from the couch.                                       CHESTER                          So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying --                           would you care for some champagne?                           That s not what I was saying, but                           would you care for some champagne?                                       TED                          No, thank you.                                       CHESTER                          Ya sure? Cristal. It s the best. I                           never liked champagne before I had                           Cristal, now I love it.                                       TED                          Okay, yeah, sure.                 As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass:                                       CHESTER                          -- As I was saying, Ted, don t worry                           about being late. For our purposes,                           promptness is far behind thoroughness.                 On  thoroughness,  he hands Ted the glass.                                       CHESTER                          Chin-chin.                 They clink glasses and drink.                                       CHESTER                          Whadya say, Ted?                                       TED                          Thank you?                                       CHESTER                          No, not thank you. Whadya say about                           the tasty beverage?                                       TED                          It s good.                                       CHESTER                          Fuckin  good, Ted. It s fuckin  good.                           Let s try it again, shall we? So,                           Ted, whadya think about the beverage.                                       TED                          It s fuckin  good.                                       CHESTER                          You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It s                           fuckin  Cristal, everything else is                           piss.                 Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted.                                       NORMAN                          Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!                 Ted knows he s being laughed at, but not why.                                       CHESTER                               (to Norman)                          Knock it off, you re making my friend                           Ted here uneasy.                               (to Ted)                          Pay no attention to Norman here,                           Ted, he s just fuckin  wit  ya, that s                           all. That s from Quadrophenia. Now                           me, myself, when I think of bellboys                           I think of --  bellboy  isn t an                           insult, is it? Is there another name                           for what you do that I m ignorant                           of? Bellman, bellperson --                                       TED                          Bellboy s fine.                                       CHESTER                          Good. I m glad they haven t changed                           that. There s a friendliness to                            bellboy.  As I was saying, Ted,                           when Norman thinks of bellboys, he                           thinks of Quadrophenia.                 But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy,                 with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?                                       TED                          No.                                       CHESTER                          You should, it s one of Jerry s better                           movies. He never says a word through                           the entire film. A completely silent                           performance. How many actors can                           pull that off? And he has to go to                           France to get respect. That says it                           all about America right there. The                           minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper                           in this fuckin  country gonna write                           articles calling the man a genius.                           It s not right. It s not right and                           it s not fair. But why should that                           surprise anybody? When has America                           ever been fair? We might be right                           every once in a while, but we re                           very rarely fair.                                       TED                          Where do you want this?                                       CHESTER                          You in a hurry, Ted?

(arm around Ted)                          The Man sitting in the chair, with                           the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand                           and the sense of humor, is Norman.                           Norman, say hello to Ted.                                       NORMAN                          What s up?                 Norman shakes his hand.                                       CHESTER                          The sociable son of a bitch on the                           telephone is Leo. And the person on                           the other end of the phone is his                           lovely wife Ellen.                               (to Leo)                          Leo, say hello to Ted.                 Leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.                                       LEO                          Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.                               (back to phone)                          What?                               (pause)                          What does punctuality have to do                           with love?                                       CHESTER                          Which brings me to me, Chester Rush,                           Ted. Pleased to meetcha.                 Chester shakes Ted s hand.                                       TED                          I know. I m sorry I haven t seen                           your movie.                 Chester stops.                 Ted wonders if he should have said that.                 Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more                 champagne. When he talks now it s slower and somewhat                 distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.                                       CHESTER                          It s quite all right, Ted, nothing                           to feel sorry about. That s why God                           invented video. But you know, Ted, a                           lot of people did see it.                 Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses                 his face, and he slowly puts it down.                 His manner gives the room a chill.                 When he talks, he addresses the room.                                       CHESTER                          Who drank out of this bottle last?                 No answer.                 Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.                                       CHESTER                          Who drank out of this bottle -- not                           the other bottles -- this bottle                           last?                                       NORMAN                          What s wrong, Chester?                 He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.                                       CHESTER                          It s fuckin  flat, Norman, that s                           what s wrong. The champagne -- the                           fuckin  Cristal s fuckin  flat.                 Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal.                 Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo                 walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little                 frightened.                 When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention                 back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle.                 But it s not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so                 far. It s more troubled and distracted.                                       CHESTER                          I was saying, Ted, a lot of people                           did see it. And not just on video,                           either. Leo, what was the final take                           on domestic?                 Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy s cool.                                       LEO                          72.1 million.                               (worried tone)                          You okay, champ?                                       CHESTER                               (struggling with bottle)                          I m cool, so talk to your wife.                 Leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside                 the room.                                       CHESTER                               (to Ted)                          72.1 million dollars. That s before                           video and before foreign, and before                           pay-TV and before free TV. We re                           talking fuckin  asses in fuckin                            seats.

On the cover is a picture of Chester smiling,                 standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy                 Corvelle. The headline reads:  Hollywood s Hottest New Star                 Next to America s Hottest Old Car.

TED                          I don t have a part.                                       CHESTER                          Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta                           say:  The less a man makes declarative                           statements, the less he s apt to                           look foolish in retrospect.  Now                           there re some inherent obstacles in                           this undertaking. First of all, I m                           not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre                           on that show, travelin  the                           countryside collecting fingers. We re                           all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman                           to lose his finger. We just wanna                           chop it off. So if fate doesn t smile                           on ol  Norman, we ll put his finger                           on ice and rush  im to a hospital,                           where in all likelihood be able to                           sew it back on.

NORMAN                          Our side.                                       CHESTER                          So Norman s protected. His interests                           have been looked after. My interests,                           on the other hand, have not. I am as                           emotionally attached to my car as                           Norman is physically to his finger.                           I m putting up a very expensive piece                           of machinery on this wager. Now, if                           I lose, I lose, I have no problem                           with that. I m a big boy, I knew                           what I was doing. However, if I win,                           I wanna win. If Norman lights his                           lighter ten times in a row, he s                           gonna have no emotional problems                           about taking my car keys whatsoever.                           But if I win, it s not inconceivable                           that Leo or myself, at the last                           minute, might not be able to wield                           the ax. Which brings us full circle                           to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed                           Ted. We want you to be the diceman.                 Pause as they all look at him. Angela breaks it.                                       ANGELA                          Helluva night, huh, Ted?                                       TED                          I gotta get out of here.                 Ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door.                 Chester whips out a hundred-dollar bill and quickly calls to                 Ted from his position at the bar.                                       CHESTER                          Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill                           here with your name on it, whether                           you do what we ask or not, just to                           sit back down in the chair for one                           minute more.                 Ted spins in his direction.                                       TED                          I m not gonna cut off his finger!                                       CHESTER                          Maybe you will and maybe you won t,                           but that has nothing to do with this                           hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You                           can tell us all to go fuck off and                           walk right out that door. But if you                           sit back down and wait sixty seconds                           before you do it, you ll be a hundred                           dollars richer.

But a minute from now,                           I m gonna walk out the door, and                           when I do, there ll be no hard                           feelings?

No hard feelings. Right, guys?                 Everybody agrees.                 Ted wearily sits back down.                 Chester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar.                                       CHESTER                          Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper.

NORMAN                          Here, here.                 Everybody gets in their position by the bar. Norman lays his                 left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out.                 In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to                 strike.                 Chester hands Ted the meat cleaver.                 Ted takes it, raises it up above Norman s finger, in position.                                       CHESTER                          Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect!

Ted, holding the                 cleaver, stares focused on Norman s pinky.                 Norman readies himself.                 Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo.                 Takes a breath.                 And strikes.                 It sparks, but doesn t light.                 Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing                 off Norman s pinky.                 Norman lets out a scream.                 Ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money                 and walks out the door.                 INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN                 CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it                 at the elevator at the other end.                 Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT,                 he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it,                 smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might ve been a bad                 night, but it s been a profitable one. He chuckles at the                 irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the                 camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.                 All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the                 door.                 As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for                 the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.                 As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats...                 then...                 The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out.                 Everybody s screaming, yelling different things to one                 another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand,                 he s screaming and crying.                                       NORMAN                          My finger, my fucking finger!!                 Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo s                 trying to direct everything. Everybody s in frantic activity,                 except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and                 watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the                 elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The                 bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around                 like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes.                 Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up,                 get to the elevator, and push the button.                 When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.                                       ANGELA                          You know, I m gonna call it a night                           and go back to my room. It s been                           fun.                 The doors close on the screaming maniacs.                 Angela walks through a door marked  Stairway.                  INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN                 MEDIUM STAIRWAY DOOR                 CREDIT ROLL continues Angela comes through the door; we                 STEADICAM in front of her as she walks the halls, looking                 for her room.

The look on her face combines strange                 awe and mild shock.                 Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell,                 wearing Diana s see-through negligee and slippers, armed                 with Elspeth s sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward                 her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.                                       ANGELA                          You okay, lady?                 The bombshell looks up at her dizzily.                                       ANGELA                          I said -- you looking for someone?

Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect                 through the eyes.                 Having had enough emotional intensity tonight, Angela breaks                 their eye contact.                                       ANGELA                          Lady, I haven t seen anybody.                 Diana quietly says,  Ohhh,  as she drifts on down the hall                 in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening                 her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway --                 empty.                 She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door                 closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.
