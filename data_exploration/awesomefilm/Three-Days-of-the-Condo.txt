Weaving through traffic on a mini-powered SOLEX is JOSEPH

sweater. A long scarf is tied around his throat and trails
behind him. The SOLEX is battered and misses occasionally.
Sometimes he peddles to assist the one cylinder engine.

It nestles among others of its ilk, behind a black iron fence

FROM THE MAN'S POV
TURNER under FINAL CREDIT moves toward the gate of the house
and pushes it open. Beside the gate is a polished bronze
plaque reading:
AMERICAN LITERARY
HISTORICAL SOCIETY
TURNER reaches the unlocked gate, pushes it open.
INT. ALHS HOUSE - RECEPTION AREA
A red light flashes and a warning buzzer sounds. Aside from
that, the first floor of this place looks just like what that
plaque says it is.
MRS. RUSSELL is at her cluttered desk. She has short grey
disheveled hair and smokes incessantly.
JENNINGS, a burly ex-sergeant, not quite comfortable in
civilian clothes, is bent over an open drawer loading film
into a hidden CAMERA. They BOTH look toward a small TV
monitor screen.
EXT. ALHS - HOUSE TURNER
He suddenly turns his back to the lens of a TV camera which
is discreetly placed.
INT. ALHS HOUSE - MRS. RUSSELL AND JENNINGS
They exchange a glance of disapproval of Turner's probably
daily-prank. As Mrs. Russell opens her desk drawer to press
a button releasing the outer door you glimpse within it a
.45.
The door opens.

Turner enters.

FLASH CUT of Jennings' desk where the Camera quickly snaps a
photo.
TURNER CLOSES the door behind him. He strides toward the
stairs, flipping up the visor. He points to his nose.
TURNER

TURNER
I was bucking headwinds, put down twelve
minutes. It's gonna rain by 10:20.
MRS RUSSELL
Thanks a lot. I left my umbrella on the
bus.
All without stopping. TURNER moves toward the rear office,
now taking his helmet off. He stops at the open door at
rear. Plants fill the room, on desk, along windowsills,
radiators and hanging from planters. And there's that odd
ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT that encourages plant-growth.
TURNER
Dr. Lappe...?
DR. LAPPE -- standing on a chair, watering one of the hanging
plants with a long-snouted watering-can -- just checks his
pocket-watch, says nothing. Turner ignores the inference,
goes on:
TURNER
Was there anything in the early pouch?
DR. LAPPE
Yes ... but nothing in response to your
report.
Oh.

TURNER
(rallying)
Maybe this afternoon.
DR. LAPPE
Please have the book you're working on
analyzed and on the computer by four
o'clock.
Yes Sir.

TURNER
And he's on his way again.

Up the-curved staircase.

INT. TURNER'S OFFICE - DAY
That one with all the models and the red wall. He enters -crosses to his desk, picks up a mystery novel from his inbasket, looks at it a moment, then puts it aside. Under
BRIGHT LIGHT, he arranges some IBM-runs. We can SEE they're
machine-translations, side-by-side, in 3 or 4 languages.

EXT. ALHS HOUSE
A light van pulls up and stops at the curb. As the DRIVER
waits, a uniformed MESSENGER gets out and goes in through the
gate. Logo on van and on the uniform says..."AAA-AROW
MESSENGER SERVICE."
Suddenly it starts to rain.
INT. HAROLD AND RAY'S OFFICE
HAROLD still works over galley proofs while RAY is working at
the terminal of a computer. TURNER pokes his head in.
TURNER
When can I get some computer time, Ray?

Five pieces, right?
JENNINGS
Affirmative. Fiver.
The envelope goes into a dispatch bag. As TURNER starts
towards the stairs, DR LAPPE comes out of his office carrying
a sheet of paper.
DR. LAPPE
Where is Mr. Heidegger?
MRS. RUSSELL
He called in sick, Dr. Lappe.

TURNER
(yelling)
Hey! Leave that bike alone!
CAMERA reveals two kids toying with the SOLEX.
ONE KID
What is it?
TURNER
Never mind, just leave it alone.
The kids walk away mumbling. TURNER looks up at the black
sky, holds his hand out to feel the rain, checks his watch
and nods. As he walks back inside CAMERA PANS TO THE BLUE
FIAT. PUSHES CLOSER to the Man behind the wheel. We still
do not see his face. His only move is to trace his finger
down a list of names computer typed on a sheet of paper.
Then he pulls up one photograph of an elderly leaky-eyed man.
The name under the photo reads R. HEIDEGGER. The MAN checks
his watch, then gets out of the car into the rain.
INT. TURNER'S OFFICE - DAY
TURNER's standing at his desk. He compares those machinetranslations again, briefly -- and shoves them aside. He
sits, pulls the galleys of that novel out of his "IN" box.
CLOSER ON TEST
TURNER's hand moving steadily down the page, part some speedreading technique...passes a certain phrase, jumps back to
it: we READ:
...The next morning, at dawn,
they transferred me to the
East Wing, 17. It was worse
than Lubjanka.
TURNER picks up a marker, draws a transparent yellow line
through certain key words: "East Wing, 17 ... Worse than
Lubjanka." He picks up the page and heads out.

EXT. REAR OF ALHS - DAY
TURNER squeezes out of the coal chute, into a narrow alley.
The close, overhanging buildings provide shelter from the
rain. TURNER pushes through a gate leading to another alley
that runs at rightangles to this one ... leading out to East
78th Street.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY
A MAN -- walking AWAY FROM CAMERA -- stops beside the blue
Fiat. He tilts his umbrella to one side, sees that the rain
has eased up enough to do without the umbrella; he collapses
it, resumes his walk.
He looks straight ahead; seems uninterested in any of the
street-life. He does one strange thing, however: passing a
waste-basket, without stopping he shoves the umbrella deep
into it, almost buries it in old newspapers and garbage.
EXT. EAST 78TH STREET - DAY
TURNER emerges from the alley, jogs across 78th Street, turns
onto Madison Avenue.

Simultaneously, a VERY TALL THIN MAN rounds onto ALHS street
from Fifth. His raincoat BULGES oddly.

JIMMY works on the lunch order with deft hands.

TURNER starts FAST along sidewalk Madison, suddenly HALTS.
Coming towards him is a woman pushing a baby carriage. She
is a dyky governess type, reflections GLINTING off her thick
glasses. She SEES him. She STOPS too, and BENDS over the
pram like to take something out.
Covering her with the pistol in his pocket, TURNER BACKS

What she takes from the pram, is not a machine gun or hand
grenade, of course, but just a BABY. She rearranges the
darling.

JOUBERT.
TURNER looks at JOUBERT: his posture, the way he's dressed,
the way his hair is trimmed. He learns nothing ... except
perhaps he's a foreigner...

between them ... JOUBERT looks away.

Someone is always willing to pay.

No. It is -- quite restful. Almost

There is only yourself. And the belief

So ... Atwood just took the games too

sooner than that. What do you think the
