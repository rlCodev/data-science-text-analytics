   FADE IN: 


   EXT. PANORAMIC VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - SUNSET 


   As we hear "What is Love" by HADDAWAY -- night falls and 
   partytime begins. 


   SUPERIMPOSE:  SUNSET BLVD., 11:03 PM 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. DANCE CLUBS - NIGHT 


   Coconut Teaser, The Palace, The Roxbury, Tatou, etc. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. DANCE CLUBS- QUICK SHOTS - NIGHT 


   Of random dancers -- gyrating, flirting, making out, drinking. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. PALACE - NIGHT 


   The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a crowded dance floor -- and 
   SETTLES ON the rhythmically swaying backs of... 


   STEVE & DOUG BUTABI 


   Our heroes.  In their minds, Steve is tall, dark and handsome and DOUG is a little genius. Neither is correct 
   -- except for the tall and little part. 


   They simultaneously turn and scope the room.  In unison, 
   their heads bop to the MUSIC.  Doug steps out from the 
   bar. 


					  DOUG 
				(to O.S. female) 
		   Hey!  You want to dance?  No? 
		   Yes?  Alright, don't worry about 
		   it. 


   Doug, rejected, steps back as Steve steps out. 


					  STEVE 
				(to O.S. female) 
		   Do you want to dance?  You do? 
		   You don't?  Not a problem. 


   They are no strangers to rejection, so neither is fazed. 
   Doug enthusiastically steps towards two attractive girls. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, you wanna...? 


   Two attractive girls turn their backs to Doug. 


					  DOUG 
				(remaining positive) 
		   No?  Maybe I'll see you later. 


   Doug steps back.  Steve spots GIRL AT end of BAR and 
   dances over to her. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, do you want to dance? 


					  GIRL AT BAR 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
				(cheerfully) 
		   Alright, you know where I'll be. 


   Steve steps back.  Doug sees a pretty woman on a balcony, 
   waving to someone. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(pointing to each other) 
		   You want him?  Me?  Him?  Me? 


   Pretty woman waves them off, frustrated, and dissapears. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Oh, you're okay? 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright then. 


   They turn around to the bar, bartender is standing in 
   front of them. 


					  STEVE 
		   Bartender, can I get a beer? 


   The bartender pays no attention and walks away.  Second 
   bartender comes from the opposite direction. 


					  DOUG 
		   Barkeep, what do you have on tap? 


   The second bartender ignores them, walks away.  The 
   bartenders keep crossing past the, paying no attention. 


					  STEVE 
		   Big guy, could I get a... 


					  DOUG 
		   My man, how 'bout a... 


					  STEVE 
		   S'cuse me, partner... 


					  DOUG 
		   Yo, buddy, I was wondering... you 
		   know what?  Don't worry about it. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, we're good. 


   They turn back to the dance floor and bop.  Suddenly, a 
   HOT GIRL dances in front of them. 


   Doug dances up behind her and frantically gyrates.  She 
   turns away -- only to find... 


   Steve gyrating behind her.  The guys close in on her 
   trapping her in the middle. 


					  HOT GIRL 
		   Get off me! 


   She runs off, furious.  The guys, unaware that she's 
   upset, celebrate. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Score! 


   They high five.  The doorman comes over with the upset 
   Girl and pulls the guys out. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   What?  What's goin' on?  What's 
		   your problem? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - NIGHT 


   The road flies by as we PAN UP the front grill of a red 
   BMW to reveal Doug and Steve.  The car stops next to two 
   girls in a white Porshe. 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


					  DOUG 
		   We got some sweetness on the left. 


   Doug Turns UP the STEREO really loud so the car is 
   pounding. 


					  STEVE 
				(to the girls) 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
				(to the girls) 
		   How you ladies doin' tonight? 


   INTERCUT GIRLS' POV 


   The guys moving their mouths -- but the girls can't hear 
   them. 


					  GIRL #1 
		   Turn your music down! 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah!  Just follow us! 


					  GIRL #2 
		   You're a big stupid ass! 


					  STEVE 
		   No.  You have beautiful eyes! 


					  DOUG 
		   I like you too! 


					  GIRL #1 
		   Go home, jerkoff! 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay, we'll meet you there. 


   The light turns green.  Girls drive off. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ROXBURY CLUB - NIGHT 


   A neon sign reads "ROXBURY." 


   ROXBURY CLUB FRONT DOOR 


   A huge muscular BOUNCER, wearing a headset, guards the 
   roped off area.  Doug and Steve confidently strut past 
   the crowd. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Stop! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Guys, this is the Roxbury.  No one 
		   gets in unless you're on the list. 


					  DOUG 
		   We're on the list. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Names? 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
		   Steve Butabi. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   You're brothers? 


					  DOUG 
		   No... 


   They slowly turn to each other and bust. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   ... Yes! 


   They high five, laughing. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Quite a joke. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug is hilarious. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, I know. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Yeah, you ever hear this one? 
		   You're not on the list. 


   Behind Steve and Doug, a '98 yellow FERRARI SCREECHES up 
   to the valet.  Car door opens and... 


   RICHARD GRIECO 


   gets out.  Looking great, in an Armani suit, beautiful 
   supermodel accompanies him. 


					  STEVE 
				(beside himself) 
		   Is that...? 


					  DOUG 
		   It is.  The King of '21 Jump 
		   Street.'  Richard Grieco. 


   Grieco quickly steps past Steve and Doug. 


					  STEVE 
				(aside to Doug) 
		   Check the wheels. 


					  DOUG 
		   Check the hottie. 


   The Bouncer jumps aside, letting them enter.  Richard 
   inadvertently rubs his nose as he enters. 


   DOUG & STEVE 


   Watching.  They both imitate his nose rub and try to 
   follow him in.  The Bouncer steps in front of them. 


					  DOUG 
				(yelling at Grieco 
				 like they know him) 
		   Alright, we'll see you later then! 
				(to Bouncer) 
		   You know what?  We're gonna take 
		   off now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Maybe we'll hang out later. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   There's no chance of that 
		   happening. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sounds good. 


   The guys exit. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


   The guys are driving. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know what was wrong with that 
		   place. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's hard to say, since we didn't 
		   get in. 


					  DOUG 
		   It's just a poorly run operation. 
		   They can't properly evaluate the 
		   incoming clientele. 


					  STEVE 
		   I thought we just didn't look cool 
		   enough. 


					  DOUG 
		   C'mon.  You?  You're a beautiful 
		   man.  I tell you what I'd do if it 
		   were my club.  I would treat all 
		   the outside wannabes just as well 
		   as any legendary former television 
		   star. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's pretty Roosevelt of you. 


					  DOUG 
		   It's just what I believe in. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD - LATER 


   A police car drives behind them, turns on the SIREN. 


   INT. BMW 


   The sound of the SIREN mixes with their MUSIC. 


					  DOUG 
		   Must be the new dance mix version. 


					  POLICE OFFICER (O.S.) 
				(loud speaker) 
		   Pull over to the side of the road! 


   A female POLICE OFFICER signals them to pull over. 


   DRIVER'S WINDOW 


   The officer steps up to their car. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   You know you were doing fifty? 


					  STEVE 
				(yelling over radio) 
		   What? 


   She reaches in, shuts OFF RADIO -- starts filling out 
   ticket. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   This is a twenty-five mile an hour 
		   zone. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hottie cop likes you. 


					  STEVE 
		   You serious? 


					  DOUG 
		   You think she pulls over anybody? 
		   Mave a move. 


					  STEVE 
				(turning to her) 
		   What's going on? 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Not much, I'm just giving you an 
		   eighty dollar ticket. 


					  DOUG 
		   She is so into you. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Can I see your license and 
		   registration? 


   Steve pulls the documents off the sun visor, hands them 
   over. 


					  STEVE 
				(seductively) 
		   I think I got what you're looking 
		   for. 


   She takes it, walks back to police car.  Doug adjusts the 
   rearview mirror. 


   POLICE CAR 


   She's on the radio. 


					  DOUG 
		   She's calling her friends. 


					  STEVE 
		   Seriously? 


					  DOUG 
		   Here she comes. 


					  STEVE 
		   How's my hair? 


   She hands Steve the papers and a ticket. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   I want you to do me a favor. 


					  STEVE 
		   Whatever you say, TJ Hooker. 


					  POLICE OFFICER 
		   Please obey any and all posted 
		   speed limit signs.  Have a good 
		   night. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's already good, now that you've 
		   served and protected me. 


   She laughs it off, walks away.  Doug takes the ticket. 


					  DOUG 
		   Way to go, my friend.  You got her 
		   badge number plus a month from now 
		   you have a date to meet her at the 
		   Municipal State Court.  Up top! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Score! 


   They high five and PEEL OUT. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. FLORENTINE GARDENS DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 


   This is a very downscale crowd, crappy cars, surrounding a dilapidated building. 


   INT. FLORENTINE GARDENS CLUB - NIGHT 


   Completely packed.  People are physically wedged up 
   against one another. 


					  DOUG 
		   This is what it's all about. 


   A big SECURITY GUY plows through the area. 


					  SECURITY GUY 
		   Folks, we got to keep this area 
		   clear! 


   The crowd moves, sweeping the guys along.  Doug and Steve 
   settle in a different spot. 


					  STEVE 
		   There's a good feeling in here. 


					  ANOTHER SECURITY GUY 
		   People, there's no lingering by 
		   the exits! 


   As it moves, Doug is engulfed in the crowd and 
   disappears. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug?... Hey, Doug!... Whoa! 


   Steve is shoved away as the crowd moves again. 


   DOUG 


   jumps up and pops his head above the crowd. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve! 


   STEVE 


   is wedged into a corner. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


   DOUG 


   pops up near the entrance to the men's room. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve! 


   DANCE FLOOR 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. MEN'S BATHROOM 


   Doug's face is wedged up against a mirror.  He struggles 
   to pull a cellular phone put of his pocket and dial. 


   INTERCUT WITH: 


   DANCE FLOOR 


   Steve is wedged against a blinking light.  We hear a 
   cellular PHONE RING.  Steve reaches in his pocket and 
   pulls out his phone. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hello? 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, it's Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, hey, Doug.  So, what's going on? 


					  DOUG 
		   Not much.  Where are you? 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't know.  Where are you? 


   Doug gets pushed up against a urinal. 


					  DOUG 
		   There's a lot of guys pulling down 
		   their pants, so it's either the 
		   bathroom or the V.I.P room.  Meet 
		   me back at the bar.  If I don't 
		   make it, I'll see you tommorow at
		   home. 


   DOUG hangs up.  O.S.  we hear someone UNZIP. 


					  DOUG 
				(panicked) 
		   Hey, just hold on a second. 


   Doug moves away. 


   INT. DANCE FLOOR - LATER THAT NIGHT 


   Two very bored club girls are standing up against a wall. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, anyway, I'm standing there 
		   waiting to use the pay phone... 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, he was.  Seriously. 


					  DOUG 
		   And this guy who's on the phone 
		   turns around and tips his hat like 
		   this. 


   DOUG does a "tip your hat" motion. 


					  STEVE 
		   And who do you think the guy was? 


   Girls still stone-faced. 


					  DOUG 
		   Emilio Estevez. 


					  STEVE 
		   The Mighty Duckman.  Swear to God. 
		   I was there. 


					  DOUG 
				(teasing) 
		   Of course, you were.  You're the 
		   one who yelled the breakfast 
		   clubber's name. 


					  STEVE 
		   I was like -- 'Emilioooo!' 


					  DOUG 
		   So, anyway... you guys want to 
		   make out or what? 


   The girls stare at them. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. AM/PM MIN-MART GAS STATION - NIGHT 


   The guys pull up.  Doug gets out and starts to pump gas. 


					  DOUG 
		   Score some chippage.  I'll meet 
		   you in there. 


   Steve exits into the AM/PM.  Doug notices a woman puttng   
   gas into her car.  She feins a smile, looks away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey! 


   Doug starts pulling the pump in and out of the gas
   tank -- simulating copulation.  She's repulsed. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. AM/PM -- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Steve looking at a bag of Pork Rinds.  Doug comes up from 
   behind. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, she's totally looking at you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Who? 


   Doug motions toward the CASHIER.  She snaps her gum and 
   is reading People magazine. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ask her where the chips are. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, I know where they are. 


   DOUG pushes him.  Steve walks over to the Cashier. 


					  STEVE 
		   Excuse me, I'm looking for the 
		   potato chips.  You know, chips 
		   made out of potato. 


					  CASHIER 
		   They're right behind you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wow, you really know what's going 
		   on, don't you? 


   He turns away and pretends to look at the chips.  Doug 
   gives him a thumbs up. 


   Richard Grieco enters the store and walks up to the 
   Cashier.  She lights up, recognizing Grieco. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, look. 


   Doug and Steve walk up to Grieco. 


					  DOUG 
				(trying to be cool) 
		   Hey. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   ... Hey. 


					  DOUG 
		   Remember us?  We were at the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Grieco) 
		   We were outside? 


   Grieco turns to Cashier. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Could I get a pack of Marlboro 
		   Lights and that 12-pack of 
		   Trojans.  Thanks. 


   Cashier rings it up,  hands it to him. 


					  CASHIER 
				(obviously enamored) 
		   Thanks. 


   Grieco exits, they all watch.  Steve approaches Cashier. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, I think I'm gonna need a 12- 
		   pack of Trojans over there. 


					  CASHIER 
		   You know, they expire in two 
		   years. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 


   Doug and Steve watch Grieco's Ferrari drive off as they 
   sit on the car and eat Pork Rinds. 


					  DOUG 
		   That nabob has got it going on. 


					  STEVE 
				(sadly envious) 
		   Kickin' it at the Roxbury, rollin' 
		   a banana Ferrari. 


					  DOUG 
		   Tasty geisha by his side. 


					  STEVE 
		   The man is a bag of chips. 


					  DOUG 
				(correcting him) 
		   All that and a bag of chips. 


					  STEVE 
		   Right.  Well, we're doing okay.  I 
		   got a number tonight. 


					  DOUG 
				(thrilled) 
		   Let me see it! 


   Steve hands him a cocktail napkin.  Doug reads it. 


					  DOUG 
		   555...?  Steve, this isn't real. 
		   It's one of those fake T.V. 
		   numbers. 


					  STEVE 
		   Is not. 


					  DOUG 
		   Is, too.  I get this number all 
		   the time. 


					  STEVE 
		   At least she respected me enough 
		   to write a fake number.  We'll get 
		   a real one one of these days. 


					  DOUG 
		   One of these days?  Steve, don't 
		   you get it?  These are our days. 
		   Now!  Today!  Ahora! 


					  STEVE 
		   Ah whatta? 


   Doug jumps off the car, starts pacing. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, we're young.  We're 
		   supposed to purge ourselves of the 
		   party virus or we'll just get so 
		   clogged up that when we're like 
		   forty we'll just explode. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, like one of those individual 
		   plastic butters you get in the 
		   diner.  You know, like when you 
		   squish it, just bursts out all 
		   over the place. 


   Steve makes explosion sound. 


					  DOUG 
		   Forget the butter, Steve.  I'm 
		   trying to explain -- 


					  STEVE 
				(interrupting) 
		   Or like when you put an egg in a 
		   microwave and all the yellow stuff 
		   flies out. 


   He mimes exploding egg. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's an exceptional way to 
		   visualize it but listen to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh!  Remember in camp when we put 
		   that can of beans in the fire? 


					  DOUG 
		   And it exploded.  Yes.  Steve!  If 
		   we're ever going to live up to our 
		   full potential, we've got to get 
		   this partying out of our systems 
		   now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Let's do it. 


   They both get in the car. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BMW - NIGHT 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Alright, let's do it!  Do it! 
		   Woo! 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Do what?  Everything's closed. 


   Beat. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then let's go home. 


					  STEVE 
				(excited) 
		   Let's go home!  Wooo! 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - MORNING 


   The house is a bad '80s combination of classical styles. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 


   We PAN AROUND to see semi-juvenile furniture -- which is 
   overwhelmed by a huge stereo system. 


   Doug sleeps, mouth open.  A piece of red licorice reaches 
   INTO FRAME and starts darting in and out of Doug's mouth. 
   He coughs and waves it away.  The licorice starts going 
   up his nostril.  Doug wakes up. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey!  Knock it off! 


					  STEVE 
		   Twizzled you, my friend. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, you totally got me. 


   STEVE laughs at this, starts eating the licorice. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was in my nose. 


   Steve stops eating. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. KITCHEN -- DAY 


   Two giant Great Danes plow through, knocking over plates. 
   We meet their dad, KAMEHL BUTABI, fifties, Eugene Levi- 
   type, with some sort of Middle Eastern accent. 


					 MR. BUTABI 
		  Captain!  Tenille!  Stop that! 


   Steve and Doug, in silk bathrobes, hair completely 
   disheveled, enter. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Look at this.  Barbara, look who's 
		   honoring us with their presence. 


   We meet their mom, BARBARA BUTABI, well kept trophy wife. 
   She tries to straighten out their hair. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Ma!... come on. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
				 (handing Doug orange 
				  juice) 
		  Here... 


					  DOUG 
				(rejecting juice) 
		   Mom, I'm trying to get my body to 
		   enter the zone, so I can optimize 
		   my fat-burning potential, and 
		   orange juice does not help! 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, according to 'Fit for Life' 
		   the idea of a balanced breakfast 
		   is a fallacy.  Your body is only 
		   prepared to accept one form of 
		   food in the A.M. -- fruit. 


   Steve grabs the glass. 


					  DOUG 
		   You can putrefy your insides if 
		   you want to.  But, I'm having a 
		   cup of cooked oatmeal, one 
		   tablespoon protein power... 


   As Doug continues, Mr. Butabi gets more and more annoyed. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... and four soy sausage links. 
				(to Steve) 
		   That's how you hit your peak. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(sarcastic) 
		   Quick, Barbara, look at Doug.  He 
		   is hitting his peak.  You don't 
		   want to miss this. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Honey, if you're going to hit your 
		   peak, do it in your room. 


					  STEVE 
		   All I want for breakfast is some 
		   sliced mangos and persimmons. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   That's enough, you two.  Your 
		   mother is not the maid. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, can you tell the maid I want 
		   some sliced mangos and persimmons? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I want you both at work in half an 
		   hour.  And, Steve wear something 
		   nice.  Emily's back from school. 


					  DOUG 
		   Excuse me, Dad, but I think you're 
		   confusing Steve for someone who 
		   gives a flying rat's ass. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wow, a flying rat's ass.  That 
		   would be wild to see. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Kamehl, they'll be there.  Just 
		   let them have their breakfast. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Sure.  Eat.  They need their 
		   strength so they can stay out all 
		   night for their dancing and their 
		   orgies. 


					  STEVE 
		   For your information, Dad, Doug 
		   and I were not able to find an 
		   orgy last night. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Barbara, explain something to me. 
		   They graduate from high school and what 
		   do they do?  Nothing.  Do they go 
		   to college?  No.  Do they take any 
		   intrest in my business?  No.  Do 
		   they think about the future?  No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, if you know all the answers, 
		   why do you keep asking the questions? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Half an hour.  I want to see your 
		   dance club asses at the store. 


   Mr. Butabi exists. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. RODEO DRIVE - SIDEWALK- AFTERNOON 


   "Staying Alive" by the BEE GEES.  Set of shoes walking, a 
   la the opening of Saturday Night Fever. 


   We WIDEN to another set of shoes -- PAN UP to reveal Doug 
   and Steve, strutting down the street like John Travolta. 
   Each holds a silk plant. 


   INT. STORE WINDOW - CELL PHONE 


   We see the guys pass.  They stop and hold up their cell 
   phone to the one in the window -- same way Travolta did 
   with the shoe. 


   A beautiful WOMAN walks by.  They turn to look at her 
   ass.  They run back and stand in front of her. She 
   pushes them aside. 


					  WOMAN 
		   Jerks. 


  She exits.  They continue.  They pass a cappucino 
  cart. 


					  CAPPUCINO SALESMAN 
		   Single or double? 


   They look at each other to confirm their choice. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Double. 


   They walk with their iced cappucinos in bubble top cups 
   with straws.  MUSIC FADES. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK PLANT STORE - LATER 


   Steve and Doug enter holding silk plants.  Mr. Butabi 
   walks up to them, takes the plants.  Doug is wearing a 
   Walkman. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Good.  Steve, you have a customer. 
		   Doug, go ring that man up. 


   They both nod agreeably.  Steve exists.  Doug doesn't 
   move, still listening to the Walkman.  Mr. Butabi pulls 
   his walkman off and points at the register.  Doug exists. 


   CASH REGISTER COUNTER 


   Doug steps behind the counter, helping a COUPLE with several silk floral arrangements. 


					  DOUG 
		   How will you be paying for this? 
		   Cash, check or charge? 


					  MAN 
				(pulling it out) 
		   Charge. 


					  DOUG 
			    (looking at it) 
		   Visa, Mastercard, or Discover? 


					  MAN 
		   Move your thumb. 


   Doug moves it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh... Visa.  Good one. 


   Doug makes a "you got me" motion.  He slides the card 
   through. 


					  DOUG 
		   I think something's wrong with 
		   your card.  You sure this is 
		   yours?  'Cause it's not 
		   processing. 


					  MAN 
		   It's my card. 


					  DOUG 
		   I better call it in. 


   Doug calls. 


					  DOUG 
		   Operator 238 please. 


   INTERCUT WITH: 


   INT. CREDIT SWITCHBOARD -- CONTINIOUS ACTION 


   SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR, with headset, in front of computer, 
   answers phone. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Authorization.  Card number? 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Doug, I told you not to call anymore. 


					  DOUG 
		   I got to get an approval. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   The card's fine. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not the card, sweetness.  Me. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Shut up and swipe it. 


					  DOUG 
		   I can go for that. 


   Doug swipes it through. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... that feel good?  'Cause I 
		   could swipe it all night. 


   Doug keeps swiping it.  The couple looks at each other. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   It's fine.  Good-bye. 


   She hangs up.  Doug happily hangs up. 


					  DOUG 
				(notices couple 
				 still waiting) 
		   ... Oh, can I help you with 
		   something? 


   ROW OF SILK FERNS 


   A middle-aged lady CUSTOMER is perusing.  Steve walks up. 


					  STEVE 
		   Excuse me, may I show you around 
		   the Silk Garden.  Home of a 
		   wondrous variety of flora and 
		   fauna -- all made of silk. 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   Are these supposed to be ferns? 


					  STEVE 
		   That's what people will say.  But 
		   guess what? 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
				(whispers in ear) 
		   ... it's not real.  It's silk. 
				(acting in shock) 
		   Oh, be careful! 


					  CUSTOMER #1 
		   What's wrong? 


					  STEVE 
		   You've accidentally wandered into 
		   the Enchanted Forest.  Allow me to 
		   be your guide. 


   Steve ducks behind the four or five silk trees that make 
   up the "forest" and sticks his head out from between two 
   trees -- now wearing a safari hat.  He picks up a    watering pot, tips it on a plant -- nothing comes out. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know what I just did? 


					  CUSTOMER #3 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
		   I just watered your plant for a 
		   whole year. 


							   CUE TO: 


   LITTLE DIORAMA OF NIGHT 


   It's a show box on the register counter, cut up silk 
   flowers inside.  Doug is making two figures dance. 


					  DOUG 
				(male voice) 
		   What's up?  You want to dance? 
				(female voice) 
		   With you.  Oh, God, yes. 


   Doug slams the figures together, singing a dance song. 
   Mr. Butabi enters. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What are you doing? 


   Doug pulls the diorama away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not much. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You don't spend enough time in 
		   dance clubs?  You have to cut up 
		   my plants, and make toys of them? 


					  DOUG 
		   This club had a jungle theme. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(calling off) 
		   Carlos!  Come work the cash 
		   register. 
				(to Doug) 
		   You get your brother and load 
		   the truck. 


   CARLOS, middle-aged assistant manager, steps behind 
   counter.  Doug grabs the diorama and exits. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. STOREFRONT - LATER 


   Next door to "BUTABI'S SILK GARDEN" is "BRIGHT IDEA" lamp 
   store.  Steve gingerly loads a tree into the store van. 
   Doug tosses his in. 


					  EMILY (O.S.) 
		   Steve!  Steve! 


   Steve starts to turn.  Doug tries to stop him. 


					  DOUG 
		   Don't look! 


   EMILY ANDERSON, a plain over-eager girl, early 20s, 
   bounces out of the lamp store, holding a CHANDELIER in 
   one hand that TINKLES every time she moves. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Steve.  Hey, Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Emily. 


					  DOUG 
				(turning away) 
		   Whatever. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, I guess you're back from 
		   school and working in the lamp 
		   store again. 


					  EMILY 
		   Yeah, I missed you. 


					  DOUG 
		   Pardon me.  I got to talk to my 
		   brother a second. 


   Doug pulls Steve aside. 


					  DOUG 
		   What, do you like her or something? 


					  STEVE 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then why are you talking to her? 


					  STEVE 
		   She's talking to me. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, look at me.  It is your 
		   destiny to be with a variety of lady 
		   girls.  Not just one lamp store 
		   troll.  And quite frankly, your level 
		   of looks is way above her level of 
		   looks.  So for her own good, just 
		   walk away. 


					  STEVE 
		   You are so smart. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's why I'm here. 


					  EMILY 
		   So, Steve, you gonna ask me out 
		   'cause I think we could have a really 
		   good time... 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, that sounds good. 


   Doug annoyed, steps between them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Back off, chicklet! 


					  EMILY 
		   What's your problem.  Doug? 


					  DOUG 
		   Emily, I don't know if you know 
		   this, but my brother and I?  We 
		   live life in the fast lane.  That 
		   means no stop signs, no red 
		   lights, and no pulling over to 
		   take pictures.  Now you see this 
		   man over here? 


   Doug motions to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
		   He's my co-pilot on this magic 
		   carpet ride.  It's a two-man 
		   operation.  One -- two -- 
				(points at Emily) 
		   -- crowd. 


					  EMILY 
		   Shut up, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sh!  I just don't want you to get 
		   hurt. 


   Their father walks over. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Emily! 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Mr. Butabi. 


   Their father puts his arm around Steve. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You know my son, Steve, here, 
		   likes you. 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, come on! 


   Doug, frustrated, walks away.  FRED ANDERSON, Emily's 
   overweight father, walks over, also holding a CHANDELIER 
   and TINKLING, puts his arm around Emily. 


					  FRED 
				(gregarious) 
		   Mr. Butabi, is Steve asking Emily 
		   to marry him again?  Ha, ha. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Ha, ha, with the way they carry on, I 
		   think they're already planning their 
		   honeymoon, Mr. Anderson. 


					  FRED 
		   Ha.  Ha.  Did I tell you?  I've 
		   already booked a wedding band. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Ha.  Ha.  Yes, and if they have 
		   enough grandchildren we won't have to 
		   hire salesmen anymore.  Ha, ha, ha... 


   Doug stands behind them and mocks laughing along with 
   them. 


					  FRED 
		   Kamehl, you kill me. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   No, you kill me.  You murder me. 


					  FRED 
				(as he walks away) 
		   ... salesmen.  That's great. 


   Emily waves good-bye to Steve. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, can you just leave Steve alone? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What?  Your brother likes the girl. 


					  DOUG 
		   No, he doesn't. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, I don't. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, nothing personal, but Emily's 
		   like a pigwoman from a planet of pig 
		   people.  And she's trying to take 
		   Steve on her porky little spaceship 
		   so she can take him back to the 
		   Planet Pig! 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on 
		   the Pig Planet?  Bacon and sausage. 


					  DOUG 
				(laughing) 
		   Nice call. 


   They high five. 


					  STEVE 
		   Every once in a while I'll hit pay 
		   dirt. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   This is all too bad, because that 
		   girl is going to be his wife. 


					  DOUG 
		   No, she's not. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Doug) 
		   You know, they could also eat ham. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Enough of pig talk.  Doug, do you 
		   see this wall?  When they marry, 
		   we can knock it down.  Then 
		   combine stores and have the first 
		   plant/lamp store.  And Steve and 
		   Emily can run it and it's up to 
		   them if they want to keep you 
		   around. 


					  DOUG 
		   Are you seeing planes?  Is your 
		   name Tatu?  Because I think you're 
		   living on Fantasy Island. 


					  STEVE 
		   God, that was a sweet show. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I have a fantasy.  That I 
		   have two capable sons who listen 
		   to me.  Look how you load the 
		   truck.  You've done enough damage 
		   for one day.  Get out of here. 
		   I'm sick of both of you! 


   Their father slams the van closed and exits into the 
   store. 
 

					 STEVE 
		   So, we're on a break? 


					  DOUG 
		   I guess. 


					  STEVE 
		   You want to Crunch it? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, I'll Crunch. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CRUNCH GYM - STEVE AND DOUG'S POV - DAY 


   of the cardiovascular room.  Long line of stairmasters, 
   treadmills, etc.  We PASS people working out. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   What's up, Stacey? 


   STACEY rolls her eyes at them and turns away. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Patty, work it. 


					  PATTY 
		   Shut up. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   Ritchie, you're the man. 


					  RITCHIE 
		   Fuck off. 


   The guys stop to look at a WOMAN on the inner thigh 
   machine.  She opens and closes her legs, notices them. 


					  WOMAN 
		   What? 


   They look back up and walk away. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Tom-meee! 


   Steve raises his hand to high five a bodybuilder, who 
   ignores them. 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
		   Catch you later. 


   INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 


   A huge muscle guy is looking in the mirror as he pumps a 
   barbell.  Doug and Steve step over.  This is the first 
   time we see them, in their gym attire -- tight Spandex 
   pants, mesh tank tops and giant weight belts. 


					  DOUG 
		   Excuse me, can the rest of us use 
		   the mirror? 


   The muscle guy moves over.  Doug picks up a small    dumbbell.  Steve spots. 


					  DOUG 
				(pumps it) 
		   How's my form? 


					  STEVE 
		   Looking good.  Relax the 
		   shoulders... breathe through it... 
		   lift don't swing... feel the 
		   burn... stitch in time... and let 
		   me hear this one... 


					  DOUG 
				(screaming) 
		   Aaaaaaaaah! 


   Steve joins in. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 


   Doug finishes, drops dumbbell. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sweet pump.  Got some veinage 
		   going. 


   Two girls walk over. 


					  DOUG 
				(whispers to Steve) 
		   Ask me what time it is. 


					  STEVE 
		   But I know what time it is. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hotties. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh... 
				(loudly) 
		   Excuse me, do you know what time 
		   it is? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, Let me check my watch. 


   Doug elaborately twists his arm to look at his watch -- 
   flexing his triceps and displaying them to their full 
   advantage. 


					  DOUG 
		   I... think it's... quarter three. 


   Doug stays unnaturally in that position till the girls 
   leave.  He relaxes. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ladies love triceps. 


   CRAIG, an overenthusiastic trainer, steps up to them. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Doug!  Steve!  What's up? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Craig! 


					  CRAIG 
		   Looking large, gentlemen.  You 
		   guys want the rest of my power 
		   bar? 


   -- holding it up. 


					  DOUG 
				(holding it up) 
		   No, we got a Nitro bar. 


					  CRAIG 
				(holding it up) 
		   How 'bout an Energy Booster Bar? 


					  STEVE 
				(holding it up) 
		   No, we got a Muscle Triplicator 
		   Bar. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Okay, but let me know if you need 
		   some carbs.  I got a case of 
		   'carbolicious' in the back.  But 
		   supplements aside, can I get some 
		   quality time with you fellas? 


					  DOUG 
		   We're in between sets.  Lay it on. 


					  CRAIG 
		   How long we been friends? 


					  STEVE 
		   All seven years of high school. 


					  CRAIG 
		   That's right.  That's why I got to be 
		   real with you now.  And I'm not gonna 
		   sugar coat it.  As a professional 
		   trainer,  I'm a little worried about 
		   your pecs.  You guys don't go all the 
		   way down.  It's called full 
		   extension.  And I'm not seeing it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Craig, you're right.  We actually had 
		   a long talk about that the other 
		   night. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I just don't want you to cheat 
		   yourselves.  I'm sorry I had to come 
		   down on you like this, but in a weird 
		   way, that's my job. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, that's why we love you and we 
		   hate you. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Still friends? 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   You know it. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I'm glad we had this talk. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, we don't talk, we do. 


   They all nod. 


   INT. AEROBICS CLASS - LATER 


   A very fit AEROBICS TEACHER stands on a mini-stage. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   Okay, everybody, I'm Shelley.  Are 
		   you ready to Cardio-Funk? 


					  CROWD (O.S.) 
		   Yeah! 


					  DOUG 
			  No!... Yes! 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, man, you are hilarious. 


   They high-five.  MUSIC STARTS.  "MOVE YOUR BODY" by 
   Amber. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   Okay!  Here comes the countdown! 
		   Three... two... one! 


   PAN a line of aerobicizers.  Everyone is in synch -- 
   except Doug and Steve, who work out chaotically. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   ... and kick! 


   Everyone kicks.  But, they continue their hyper dance. 


					  AEROBICS TEACHER 
		   ... and reach. 


   Everyone reaches.  They continue being out of synch. 


   Suddenly, they stop, put fingers on their necks and stare 
   up at a clock.  Simultaneously, they go right back into 
   their manical dance. 


   MUSIC ENDS.  Everyone but Doug and Steve stop.  People 
   stare at them.  They continue in silence, then slowly 
   wind down as they notice people staring. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright!  Yeah! 


					  STEVE 
		   Cardio-funk! 


					  DOUG 
		   Thank you, Shelley! 


   Shelley stares at them.  After a few uncomfortable beats. 
  


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   ... what's up? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. CRUNCH GYM - AFTERNOON 


   Doug and Steve simultaneously put on their sunglasses. 


					  STEVE 
		   Should we go back to work? 


					  DOUG 
		   Probably. 


					  STEVE 
		   What do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   We shaked it, let's bake it. 


   They walk off. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON 


   Guys drive along highway in BMW.  Ocean on one side. 
   Steve stares off at the ocean. 


					 STEVE 
		   Water. 


					   DOUG 
		   Where? 


					  STEVE 
		   There. 


   Doug turns. 


					  DOUG 
		   Right. 


   EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON 


   We see Steve and Doug, waist up.  They have lotion caked 
   up unevenly on themselves. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, I told Dad we should put 
		   some ferns and some silk banana 
		   trees in front of the store. 
		   'Cause then passersby and the like 
		   could see 'em and we could attract 
		   more customers. 


					  DOUG 
				(unsure what he just 
				 heard) 
		   Moonwalk that by me again? 


					  STEVE 
		   I just said I was talking to Dad 
		   about the store and... 


					  DOUG 
		   The store?  You're sitting around 
		   thinking about the store? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah. 


					  DOUG 
		   Why? 


					  STEVE 
		   That's where we work. 


					  DOUG 
				(exploding) 
		   That's right.  And is that all you 
		   want to do with your life?  Is 
		   that all you think we're capable 
		   of doing -- 


   Two hot bikini babes walk past them.  Guys immediately 
   stop arguing and turn.  We -- 


							   CUT TO: 


   SAME SCENE - WIDE ANGLE 


   -- to see the guys full body, for the first time. 
   They're wearing black Gucci G-string bathing suits.  They 
   flex and hold uncomfortable body positions to show off 
   their muscles. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  STEVE 
		   Want to go for a swim or what? 


					  DOUG 
				(strangled, twisting 
				 arm unnaturally) 
		   ... about quarter after... five 


   The girls walk away.  The guys stop flexing and resume 
   their argument. 


					  DOUG 
		   -- capable of doing with our 
		   lives! 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Doug, why are you Mt. St. 
		   Helensing on me? 


					  DOUG 
		   Because I want more for you.  I 
		   care about you. 


					  STEVE 
		   That is so sweet of you. 


					  DOUG 
		   I know.  And you deserve better. 
		   You deserve to get into the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, there's a list.  You have to 
		   be like a Richard Grieco type guy. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type 
		   guys.  We should be on that list. 
		   We're 'A' club people leading a 
		   'B' club life. 


					  STEVE 
		   We've been going to 'B' Clubs? 
		   Why didn't you ever tell me this? 


					  DOUG 
		   I didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
		   I know how sensitive you are. 


					  DOUG 
		   'Cause we settle.  'Cause we keep 
		   going to all those 'B' clubs ever 
		   night  They can smell 'B' club on us 
		   like barf in a bathroom.  From now 
		   on, the only club we go to is the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, how -- 


					  DOUG 
		   But, nothing. 


					  STEVE 
		   We can't -- 


					  DOUG 
		   We can.  And we will.  Because no 
		   matter how many lists and roped 
		   off areas the big bouncer in the 
		   sky throws in front of us, we will 
		   get through.  You know why? 


					  STEVE 
		   We're good-looking? 


					  DOUG 
		   Very good-looking.  You especially. 
		   Now, repeat after me. 


					  STEVE 
		   'After me.'  Sorry.  I'm just 
		   kidding. 


					  DOUG 
				(completely serious) 
		   And it was hysterical.  I'm just not 
		   laughing to preserve the drama of the 
		   previous moment. 


					  STEVE 
		   Understood.  Continue. 


					  DOUG 
		   Repeat after me.  We can get in the 
		   Roxbury. 


					  STEVE 
		   We can get into the Roxbury. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   Roxbury!  Roxbury!  Roxbury! 


   They leap up and down.  Two girls walk by.  They 
   immediately stop. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What's up? 


								   CUT TO: 


   INT. BUTABI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


   Mr. Butabi, Mrs. Butabi, Fred Anderson, MABEL ANDERSON, 
   Fred's middle America wife, and Emily are having coffee 
   in the living room.  Emily is obviously dressed up to 
   attract Steve. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(mid-conversation) 
		   ... And then, and I swear this is 
		   true, someone came into the store 
		   today and thought it was a real 
		   plant store. 


					  MABEL 
		   No? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I would not kid about that. 


   Doug and Steve burst in, still in their black Gucci G- 
   strings, head up the stairs. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Hello? 


   Doug and Steve turn. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey. 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   The Andersons here.  Get dressed 
		   and come join us. 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Sorry, Dad, we're busy 
		   tonight. 


					  EMILY 
		   I like your bathing suit, Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   Thanks Emily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, again! 


					  STEVE 
		   I mean, whatever, Emily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Nice to see you, folks. 


   The guys rush upstairs.  Suddenly, we hear MUSIC pounding 
   from their room. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Excuse me a minute. 


   Mr. Butabi goes upstairs. 


   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT 


   The guys are picking out their clothes in the closet 
   Mr. Butabi enters and shuts off the MUSIC. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   If I tell you to do something, you 
		   do it.  And what is this business 
		   of coming in naked.  Put on your 
		   pants and come down. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ain't on our 'Things to do' list. 
		   Daddy-o.  Steve and I have 
		   something extremely important to 
		   do tonight. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, to come downstairs. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad! 


   Doug goes in their bathroom and slams the door. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Why can I not get through to him? 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. 
		   You just keep putting things in, 
		   face down, and you need to have a 
		   cover page, because if you don't 
		   -- people don't know where it's 
		   coming from and sometimes you 
		   don't get through on the first 
		   call.  That's why you got a redial 
		   button and a memory button 
		   because... you know... actually, I 
		   never use those buttons.  I always 
		   screw it up.  I don't know. 


   Doug opens the bathroom door. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Steve) 
		   Don't try to explain it to him. 
		   He'll never understand. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Oh, I understand.  You are going 
		   out tonight. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's right. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I just don't understand what 
		   you're driving. 


   Mr. Butabi takes their keys off the dresser and grabs 
   their cell phones and starts to exit. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Hey!  Dad!  What are you doing! 


   Mr. Butabi exits. 


   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 


   Emily is standing, singing "Memories" from Cats. 
   Everyone is listening. 


					  EMILY 
		   'Memories, all alone in the 
		   moonlight...' 


   Fred nods "isn't she good" to Kamehl, who agrees. 


   Steve and Doug, dressed to kill, stomp down the stairs. 
   Doug turns to Mr. Butabi. 


					  DOUG 
		   You can take away our phones.  You 
		   can take away our keys.  But, you 
		   can't take away our dreams! 


					  STEVE 
		   That's right.  'Cause we're like 
		   sleeping when we have them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Later much. 


   The guys exit.  Steve pauses a moment. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, nice voice. 


					  DOUG (O.S.) 
		   Steve! 


   Steve exits. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Mrs. Butabi runs after them, holding old brick-sized 
   cell phones. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Boys!  Boys! 


   The guys stop. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   I don't like you going out without 
		   a phone.  What if something 
		   happens? 


   She hands them the cell phones. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ma, these are embarrassing. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Take it in case of emergency. 


   She kisses them and walks back in. 


					  DOUG 
		   Did Ma get lipstick on me? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, but it looks like you were 
		   making out. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, good. 


   In b.g., Mom gets knocked over by Great Danes.  No one 
   notices. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - LATER 


   We see the van driving down the street. 


   INT. SILK GARDEN VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug Pulls down sun visor, checks his hair.  Tries rear- 
   view mirror -- still good.  Then leans across Steve, 
   who's driving, and looks in the driver's side 
   view mirror -- still good. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, how's my hair? 


					  STEVE 
		   Looks good. 


					  DOUG 
		   Roxbury good? 


					  STEVE 
		   You know it.  How do I look? 


					  DOUG 
		   Robust and attractive.  I gotta 
		   tell you -- tonight, I can taste 
		   it. 


   Steve doesn't respond and suddenly SLAMS the BRAKES. 
   Doug gets thrown forward. 


					  STEVE 
				(completely losing 
				 it) 
		   I can't taste it, Doug!  I can't! 
		   I'm so scared right now I don't 
		   know what to do! 


					  DOUG 
				(calming him down) 
		   Bro, you're mad cowing on me. 
		   Relax. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm nervous, man.  We've put all 
		   this pressure on ourselves to get 
		   into the Roxbury, and I don't know 
		   if we can deliver! 


					  DOUG 
		   You gotta take control of yourself. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, you gotta take control!  I am 
		   barely hanging on here!... You... 


   Steve starts crying.  Doug cradles him. 


					  DOUG 
		   Whoa... settle down... relax... 
		   think puppies and candy canes... 
		   easy... 


   Doug notices two girls walking by the van. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's up? 


					  STEVE 
				(completely 
				 recovered) 
		   How you doing, little lady? 


   From O.S., a beer BOTTLE flies INTO FRAME at them and 
   SMASHES on the van. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright.  Maybe later then. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and 
		   I hate to be the one to burst it.  I 
		   just don't think our names are on 
		   that list. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, get real.  The bouncer isn't 
		   checking a list.  He's checking us. 
		   Man, I can't believe all this time, 
		   that's what you thought. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, why didn't we ever get in before? 


					  DOUG 
		   We were kids.  We were completely 
		   immature. 


					  STEVE 
		   But that was last night.  And now we 
		   don't even have our car. 


					  DOUG 
		   Perfect.  Rites of passage.  Like 
		   that Africa show on P.B.S.  When it's 
		   time for a boy to become a man, they 
		   send him to the jungle with nothing 
		   but a spear to hunt the lion 
		   The van is our spear and the Roxbury is 
		   our lion.  And when the hunt is over, 
		   we shall be men. 


					  STEVE 
		   Does the bouncer know about this? 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, Steve, what really matters 
		   is that at the end of the night -- 
		   when all is said and done and all 
		   hotties have been hit upon -- if 
		   either of us has just one girl's 
		   number, just one, then we'll know, 
		   for the first time in our lives, 
		   we're really worth something. 


   EXT. ROXBURY CLUB - NIGHT 


   The guys pull up -- get out.  Steve tosses Doug the keys. 
   Doug tosses the keys to the valet -- who ignores them. 
   Keys fall to the ground.  Doug runs over, picks up keys 
   -- hands them to the valet.  Walks back to Steve. 


					  DOUG 
		   Storm the castle. 


					  STEVE 
		   Take no prisoners. 


   Doug and Steve try to walk/bop up to the Bouncer.  They 
   wave to people who aren't there, trying to act cool, and 
   attempt to walk in.  Bouncer stops them. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, my good hombre, remember us 
		   from last night? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug and Steve Butabi. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   You're brothers? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   No... Yes! 


					  STEVE 
		   Works every time. 


   They laugh hysterically. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Now, I remember.  You can't come in. 


   A flashy guy walks past them, in SLOW MOTION, slapping a 
   fifty dollar bill into the Bouncer's hand and entering. 


					  DOUG 
				(aside to Steve) 
		   Okay, it's time to play a little 
		   softball. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hello, my good man.  How's it going 
		   tonight? 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Good.  You're still not getting in. 


					   DOUG 
		   Well, that's not what a good 
		   friends of mine told me.  Maybe you 
		   know him?  His name is Abraham. 


   Doug drops a five dollar bill on the Bouncer's clipboard. 
   The Bouncer doesn't move. 


					  DOUG 
		   You don't know him? 


					  STEVE 
		   How 'bout his two friends?  George 
		   Washington and... George 
		   Washington? 


   Steve drops two one-dollar bills.  The Bouncer doesn't 
   move. 


					  DOUG 
		   Let's not forget the other boy in 
		   the band, Mr. Hamilton.  He's a 
		   little lonely, wants to join his 
		   buddies. 


   DOUG holds out a ten.  He waves it up and down, sideways, 
   drops it, but the Bouncer still doesn't respond. 


					  STEVE 
		   Wait up, look what we got here... 


   Steve reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change, 
   starts dropping coins. 


					  STEVE 
		   Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, 
		   Lincoln... 


					  DOUG 
		   ...Roosevelt, Roosevelt, 
		   Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a 
		   commemorative coin -- '84 
		   Olympics -- what a proud chapter 
		   in Angelino history. 


   The Bouncer looks down and turns his clipboard over, 
   dropping all the money to the ground.  OFF guys' 
   reaction... 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK VAN - LATER 


   The van stops and starts as they look out the window. 


					  DOUG 
		   There's one! 


   Steve stops.  They look out. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's not an A.T.M.  That's where 
		   you drop off your videos. 


					  DOUG 
		   Wait, there's one! 


   Steve stops short.  They look out.

   EXT. VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   We see a yellow FERRARI BARREL into the back of the 
   flower van.

   INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   The guys are thrown forward.  All the plants are thrown 
   on top of them.

   EXT. VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Richard Grieco is driving the other car, BLONDE MODEL 
   with him. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Oh, shit!  The car. 


					  BLONDE MODEL 
		   Car?  What about me? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   No, this car is illegal.  All I 
		   need is a police report. 


					  BLONDE 
		   What do you mean? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   It's a racing car.  I imported it 
		   illegally. 


   The guys slowly get out of their van, dazed, dragging 
   plants as they get out. 


					  STEVE 
		   You okay? 


					  DOUG 
		   Let me see... 


   Doug slowly bops his head, feeling if there's anything 
   loose. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Ah, great.  They're starting in 
		   with the neck injuries.  I'm 
		   screwed. 


   Both guys check if their heads still work.  Grieco comes 
   over. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey, sorry about your car. 


					  DOUG 
		   No way.  Richard Grieco! 


					  STEVE 
		   Remember, we saw you last night? 


   Grieco nods, unsure, but agreeable. 


					  DOUG 
				(To Richard) 
		   Like Walt Disney says, my man, 
		   'It's a small world after it all.' 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So, are you guys alright? 


					  STEVE 
		   My neck hurts. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
				(re:  cars) 
		   Right, so, what do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   We were just going to the Roxbury 
		   again. 


					  STEVE 
		   But we couldn't get in. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey, you guys want me to get you 
		   in the Roxbury? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Yeah! 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Great.  Follow me. 


   Grieco goes back to his car. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is amazing. 


					  DOUG 
		   See?  It all comes from within. 
		   And he felt it.  Because he's an 
		   actor and he's very sensitive. 


   The guys get back in the van. 


   INT. VAN 


					  DOUG 
		   Put in 'D' and blast me. 


   Steve shoots Binaca spray into Doug's mouth and shifts. 


   GRIECO'S CAR (MOVING) 


   Grieco is driving. 




					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   We got to make a stop at the Roxbury. 


					  BLONDE MODEL 
		   What about the party? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   I don't want a lawsuit, okay? 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ROXBURY - LATER 


   Richard Grieco walks with the Blonde Model, Steve and 
   Doug trailing behind, walking past a huge line of club 
   goers.  Steve starts breathing heavy -- he's nervous. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, keep it together.  Think 
		   F-R-A. Focus, rhythm, attitude. 


					  STEVE 
		   Got it... Fra. 


   They all reach the entrance. 


					  BOUNCER 
		   Mr. Grieco.  Nice to see you. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   I got two. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Bouncer) 
		   That's right.  We're with Richard 
		   Grieco. 


					  STEVE 
				(to line of people) 
		   That's right.  Grieco!

   INT. ROXBURT - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Red velvet curtains.  Steve and Doug push through the 
   curtains and are stunned. 


   STEVE AND DOUG'S POV 


   Beautiful, sexy, expensively dressed people mill around. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh my God, Doug, this is the most 
		   amazing place I've ever been. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Hey guys!  This is the coat room. 
		   The club's in here. 


   The guys follow Grieco. 


   INT. DANCE CLUB - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   The guys enter with Grieco.  MUSIC BLASTING. Long, 
   crowded bar, odd-shaped velvet couches, model types are 
   Velcroed to the walls, huge crowded dance floor.  This is 
   it. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
				(stunned) 
		   ...Sweet. 


    The guys follow Grieco, greeting passing women. 


					  DOUG 
		   Whats' up? 


					  STEVE 
		   What's up?... 
				(faster) 
		   What's up, what's up, whats' up, 
		   what's up, what's up... 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Get a hold of yourself. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sorry, it's hottie overload in here. 


					  DOUG 
		   Pace yourself. 


					  STEVE 
				(counting to himself) 
		   ... What's up?... two, three... 
		   What's up? 


   MR. ZADIR, the club owner, 45, Armani suit, magnanimously 
   greets them, holding a drink -- he speaks with a foreign 
   accent. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Richard, my man!  Good to see you. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Benny.  Place is kickin'. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Actually, it's jumping.  Like '21 
		   Jump Street,' right?  Ha! 
				(to Steve and Doug) 
		   My children watch the reruns on 
		   T.V. land. 
				(to Grieco) 
		   Who are your friends? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir.  He 
		   owns this place.  These are uh.. 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
		   Steve Butabi. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Let me show you my V.I.P. table. 


   They follow Zadir through the crowd.  As they walk... 


					  DOUG 
				(aside to Steve) 
		   Oh my God!  The owner. 


					  STEVE 
		   I know! 


					  DOUG 
		   He's the man who pulls the 
		   strings.  The Gepetto of party. 


					  STEVE 
		   Plus, he's the owner. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sh!  Listen and learn, my friend. 


   They arrive at a table overlooking the dance floor. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(waving to someone O.S.) 
		   Yes!  I see you!  Excuse me, I 
		   have to say hello to Bob Saget. 


   Mr. Zadir exits. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So, you guys come here a lot? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, all the time. 


					  STEVE 
		   But, we're never been inside. 


   Grieco and his date look at each other. 


					  DOUG 
				(aside) 
		   Steve, what are you saying, be 
		   cool. 
				(to Grieco) 
		   So, is Johnny Depp meeting you 
		   here or what? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   No.  So you guys look like you 
		   really know how to party. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, yeah, we never stop. 


					  STEVE 
		   We're pretty much out of control. 


   Mr. Zadir returns, shouting behind him. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(to Bob O.S.) 
		   I get it, Bob, the club is 
		   crowded, so it's a 'Full House' 
		   like your show. 
				(to Richard) 
		   He's too much. 


   Grieco and his date start to get up. 


					 RICHARD GRIECO 
		  Benny, we'll see you at the party. 
		  I'll see you guys. 


					 DOUG/STEVE 
		  See ya.  Richard Grieco! 


					 RICHARD GRIECO 
			    (To Blonde) 
		   Their necks looked alright, right? 


   Grieco and Blonde exit.  A waiter puts a bottle of 
   champagne on the table and Zadir begins to pour glasses 
   -- he's obviously had a few. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sir, I just want to say, and I mean 
		   this with the utmost sincerity, it is 
		   an honor to shoot the shit with the 
		   owner of the club of all clubs. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and we're proficient club 
		   hoppers -- so we know what we're 
		   talking about. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Thank you. 


					  DOUG 
		   I mean, we usually go this place 
		   called 'The Palace' and that place is 
		   rank.  The music is ancient. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, no celeb citings and the women 
		   are oinkers. 


					  DOUG 
		   And they let any asswad in the 
		   door.  It's the worst. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   I own that place also. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, but it's a really good 
		   location. 


					  STEVE 
		   And the drinks are reasonably 
		   priced. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   No, no.  You are right.  That's 
		   what's wrong with this club 
		   business.  One day you are hot 
		   next day you are not.  People get 
		   bored easily. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, you know I had this great 
		   idea.  You should make this place 
		   like a tropical jungle. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, lots of silk plants and 
		   vines. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, but they're not real vines. 
		   They're bungee cords and people 
		   could like swing from one end to 
		   the other so if you left your 
		   friends at the bar, you could get 
		   back to them. 


   Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and the barmaids could wear 
		   loincloths -- but tasteful.  Like 
		   the ones they wear in strip clubs. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   You could not insure bungee cords. 
		   People jumping back and forth. 
		   Too expensive. 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay.  Hit delete on that one. 
		   Doug, tell him about your street 
		   idea. 


					  DOUG 
		   I was just thinking, you know how 
		   people get bummed waiting outside 
		   to get in the club. 


   Zadir nods, listening to this one. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is good.  You're gonna love 
		   this. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, you make the outside of the 
		   club look like the inside.  You 
		   know, you put down a rug outside 
		   and some couches and pipe out some 
		   music.  People will love it.  But, 
		   then on the inside. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, this is the good part. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Looks like the street.  You 
		   know, you park some cars inside, a 
		   mailbox, street signs, and that 
		   way when they come in, it's like 
		   the outside is the inside and 
		   inside is the outside. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doesn't that blow your mind? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   It hurts my brain to think about 
		   it.

   CAMBI and VIVICA, predatory model types, scope out the

					  CAMBI 
		   How many? 


					  VIVICA 
		   One. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Uch.  How'd he get in? 


					  VIVICA 
				(annoyed) 
		   ... Look, I don't see anything 
		   over six figures... So, let's just 
		   go. 


   Vivica stabs out her cigarette, begins to pack up. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Wait a second.  That's that Zadir 
		   guy. 


   Vivica looks up. 


   STEVE AND DOUG AND MR. ZADIR 


   laughing and drinking champagne. 


   CAMBI and VIVICA 


					  CAMBI 
		   Too bad he's married.  He owns all 
		   the clubs in town.  Plus, dry 
		   cleaners, that beeper service, and 
		   Mailboxes, Etc... 


					  VIVICA 
		   Who are those guys with him? 


   Cambi reaches into her purse and pulls out Money 
   magazine's richest people issue. 


					  CAMBI 
		   I can't find them, but if they're 
		   with Zadir, they've got to be 
		   worth something. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Great.  Let's work. 


   TABLE 


   The guys are pitching Zadir another idea, GILBERT 
   GOTTFRIED comes over.

		   Benny! 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in? 


					  GILBERT GOTTFRIED 
		   You have to say hello to my friend 
		   at the other table.  Not this 
		   table.  No.  No.  The other one. 
		   Looks like this table -- other 
		   people around it.  I have a friends 
		   and he needs you to say hello to 
		   him at the other table. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   You have a friend? 


					  GILBERT GOTTFRIED 
		   Oh my God!  You got me!  I didn't 
		   see it coming.  No.  It was coming 
		   but I was not able to see it. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   I better go before he explodes. 


   Gilbert and Zadir walk away. 


					  DOUG 
				(nervous) 
		   Was I too pushy?  I was too pushy. 
		   Did I speak well? 


					  STEVE 
		   You were totally articulate. 


					  DOUG 
		   Maybe he didn't like our ideas. 
		   It's hard to pitch in a night 
		   club.  You ever notice, the music 
		   is blasting in here.  We should 
		   try to get a meeting. 


   Steve starts looking off at something, mesmerized. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, Steve, what if we... 


   Doug sees what Steve is watching.  He also becomes 
   mesmerized. 


   CAMBI AND VIVICA 


   In SLOW MOTION, like two cars, the girls saunter across 
   the dance floor, toward Steve and Doug. 


   STEVE and DOUG 


   even more mesmerized. 


   CAMBI AND VIVICA 


   even closer. 


   STEVE AND DOUG 


   still staring at the girls.  The girls walk up to them. 


					  STEVE 
				(on automatic) 
		   Up what's?  You want to dance? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Yes. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, she said 'Yes.' 


					  STEVE 
		   What? 


					  DOUG 
				(amazed) 
		   Hotties want to shake it, come on. 


   DANCE FLOOR 


   Steve and Doug surround the girls and frenetically 
   gyrate, pushing into them.  The girls escape and Steve 
   and Doug end up slam dancing against each other. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hey, guys!  Over here. 


   Cambi takes Doug's hand.  Vivica grabs Steve's hand. 


   "This is Your Night" by AMBER starts.  The following is a 
   perfectly choreographed dance to the music. 


   The girls dance seductively, dancing toward the boys. 


   Doug and Steve, unsure what's going on, look at each 
   other. 


   Simultaneously, the girls start to mimic the girls' 
   moves. 


   The boys do some hand jive, the girls match them   perfectly. 


   They begin a variety of dips, swings and techno style 
   dances. 


   They're incredible.  The crowd watches them... 


   Doug and Steve start doing some moves together. 


   An impressed JOHN TRAVOLTA comes over to them. 


   John adds his own movements and the guys follow suit. 


   John, Steve, Doug, and the girls do a synchronized 
   dance. 


   THE MUSIC STOPS.  Crowd cheers. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Travolta) 
		   Bro, you are incredible! 


					  DOUG 
		   Seriously, unbelievable stuff out 
		   there.  So, you want to hang out? 


					 JOHN TRAVOLTA 
		   No. 


   Travolta starts to exit. 


					  STEVE 
		   Alright, catch you later then. 


					 JOHN TRAVOLTA 
		   I don't think so.

   EXT. LAUREL CANYON  -- LATER 


   Mr. Zadir's black limo is driving. 


   INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir, Vivica and Cambi are inside. 
   Zadir pops open a bottle of Dom Perignon and starts 
   pouring. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Wow, 1980, good year! 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, '80 was an excellent year. 
		   Devo had a big hit that year. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie' 
		   started that year. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was just a cheap spinoff. 


					  STEVE 
		   That was a spinoff? 


					  DOUG 
		   Of course, those characters 
		   originated on 'Happy Days.' 


					  STEVE 
		   I did not know that. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But, 
		   does Chachi give a Fuck about Joanie? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Cambi makes a good point.  But 
		   tonight we should have fun, not dwell 
		   on Scott Baio. 


					  STEVE 
				(drinking) 
		   Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dom Perignon's good but you know what 
		   really makes a party -- Redi Whip. 


					  STEVE 
		   But not like when you put it on 
		   stuff.  It's when you're half 
		   pressing on that little white nozzle 
		   and like before it comes out, you 
		   suck on it, and it's really fun. 


					  CAMBI 
		   You mean like nitrous oxide? 
		   Whippets? 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(taken aback) 
		   ... No! 


					  DOUG 
				(dumbfounded) 
		   Tscha!  What is that? 


   Mr. Zadir lowers the panel between the driver and the 
   rear. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(to driver) 
		   Dooey!  We must stop and get Redi 
		   Whip! 


   DOOEY, 35, black suit and tie, looks in a rearview mirror 
   . 


					  DOOEY 
		   Yes, sir. 


   Zadir raises the panel. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Dooey) 
		   But it has to be Redi Whip in a can! 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Wait, he can't hear you. 


   Zaidir lowers the panel, nods to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   I was just saying it has to be 
		   Redi Whip in a can. 
  


					  DOOEY 
				(annoyed) 
		   Right. 


   Zadir raises the panel. 


					  DOUG 
		   He really can't hear us? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dooey, tell your mother I had a 
		   really good time last night! 


					  STEVE 
		   And your father! 


					  DOUG 
		   What? 


					  STEVE 
		   I mean your sister! 


					  DOUG 
		   Good one. 


   The guys high five.  Cambi and Vivica exchange looks of 
   disbelief.  Dooey lowers the panel. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Mr. Zadir, I'm pulling over here 
		   to get whipped cream.

   EXT. 7-11- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Dooey pulls over and gets out.  Doug looks out the 
   window. 


   DOUG'S POV 


   He watches Dooey talking to the cash register person. 


					  DOUG 
		   I'll be right back. 


   Doug gets out.

   INT. 7-11- CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Dooey hands the cash register person a credit card, who 
   swipes it.  Doug rushes in. 


					  DOUG

   Doug grabs the phone. 


					  DOUG 
		   Operator 238, please... What's up? 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CREDIT CARD CENTER - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   It's the same Switchboard Operator he talked to at the 
   store.  The following conversation is INTERCUT... 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
				(resigned) 
		   Hello, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   Guess where we went tonight? 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Let me see, the 7-11 on Ventura? 


					  DOUG 
		   No, I mean, before this, you sly 
		   little credit vixen. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   Doug! 


					  DOUG 
		   The Roxbury with Richard Grieco 
		   and Bob Saget.  You gotta come out 
		   sometime. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   I would.  But then there'd be no 
		   one to approve all the money you 
		   spend. 


					  DOUG 
		   You're always thinking of me. 


					  SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR 
		   The card's good.  'Bye, Doug. 


   She hangs up.  Doug hands the phone back. 


					  DOUG 
		   She approved.

   EXT. MANSION - LATER 


   Modern style house.  Lights dot a gravel driveway that 
   leads to the entrance.  The limo drives up. 


					  STEVE (V.O.) 
		   Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir. 


   EXT. BACK YARD OF MANSION 


   THERE'S A PARTY IN FULL SWING.  Spice Girls are   performing.  A pool with a waterfall is the center of the party.  People are dancing, drinking, swimming, etc. 


   PATIO DOOR 


   opens.  Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir and the girls enter. 


					  DOUG 
		   Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. 
		   For a guy who owns sleazy night 
		   clubs, the decor in your house is quite 
		   tasteful. 


					  STEVE 
		   Good one. 


   The guys nod to each other, proud of their compliment. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Excuse us, we're going to the 
		   ladies' room. 


   The girls walk off.  Mr. Zadir notices something. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Anna Nicole!  Put something on! 
		   You are making us sick! 


   Mr. Zadir walks away. 


					  DOUG 
		   Do you feel it, Steve?  We are 
		   finally experiencing the party 
		   lifestyle to the fullest degree. 
		   Let's mingle. 


   They walk over to a Fabio type MODEL GUY. 


					  DOUG 
		   How's it hanging?  You want to 
		   mingle? 


					  STEVE 
		   Cool party, huh? 


					  MODEL GUY 
			    (who the hell are 
				these guys) 
		   ... I guess. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into 
		   gear right about... 


   Steve and Doug pause a moment.  Model Guy looks at each 
   of them. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... now. 
		   


					  DOUG 
		   So, what do you do? 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   I'm a model. 


					  DOUG 
		   Oh, right.  So are we. 


					  STEVE 
		   It's a hard job. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, you know, like you got to 
		   stand still all the time and uh... 


					  STEVE 
				(racking his brain) 
		   ... Standing still.  Standing 
		   still is really hard.  My foot 
		   cramps sometimes. 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   I know what you mean.  What agency 
		   you with?  Elite, Ford? 


					  STEVE 
		   Uh huh. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Model) 
		   So, do you like mingling? 


					  MODEL GUY 
		   Excuse me. 


   The Model Guy walks away. 


					  STEVE 
		   Nice guy. 


					  DOUG 
				(off at Model Guy) 
		   See you on the shoot! 


   As they start eating their pasta primavera again, a NAKED 
   WOMAN emerges from the pool and walks directly towards 
   them.  Steve and Doug forget how to chew and stand, 
   stunned. 


					  NAKED WOMAN 
		   Can you pass me a towel, please? 


   They talk directly to her breasts, trying to be 
   nonchalant, but answering questions she hasn't asked. 


					  STEVE 
		   Good.  How are you? 


					  DOUG 
		   ... about eight o'clock, eight 
		   fifteen. 


					  NAKED WOMAN 
		   They're right behind you.  Can you 
		   just reach over? 


					  STEVE 
		   Thanks.  All the time. 


					  DOUG 
		   Sagittarius. 


					  STEVE 
		   BMW. 


					  DOUG 
		   Right off Sunset. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vanilla mostly. 


   She shoves by them and exits.  Mr. Zadir comes over. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Look at this, I have the Spice 
		   Girls, yet nobody is dancing. 


   The guys snap out of it. 


					  DOUG 
		   With all due party-throwing 
		   respect, you know what the problem 
		   is, Mr. Zadir?  This pool is 
		   taking up all the prime dancing 
		   real estate. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, you know, if there were a big 
		   piece of glass you could put over the 
		   pool, you could use it as a dance 
		   floor.  And it would be really sweet 
		   because people would feel like they 
		   were dancing on water. 


					  DOUG 
		   And you could put fish in the water 
		   and it would be like the ocean. 


					  STEVE 
		   Or, Doug, you know what would be 
		   another amazing idea?  You could have 
		   a special room for people who want to 
		   dance naked. 


					  DOUG 
		   Plus, then you could have a room next 
		   to that room with a one-way mirror so 
		   other people could watch them. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(calming them down) 
		   Boys, boys, please let's not talk 
		   business.  We'll schedule a meeting 
		   for this. 


   Guys silently/joyously high five their meeting.  Cambi, 
   Vivica enter. 


					  CAMBI 
		   There you are. 


					  VIVICA 
		   We got scared. 


					  DOUG 
				(protective) 
		   Of who?  We'll kick his ass. 


					  CAMBI 
		   No, we got scared someone stole 
		   you away from us. 


   Doug and Steve ponder the meaning of this statement for a 
   beat, having rarely heard a compliment. 


					  DOUG 
				(realizes it's a 
				 compliment) 
		   Oh... 
				(to Steve) 
		   Like some other girls would steal 
		   us away. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, right... Oh! 


					  CAMBI 
		   Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we 
		   borrowed them for a while? 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   Yes... 


   They all look at him. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
		   ... No! 
				(laughs) 
		   Got you! 


					  DOUG 
		   Good one, Mr. Zadir. 


					  STEVE 
		   He totally got me. 


					  DOUG 
		   Mr. Zadir, let me just say that 
		   you, sir, are a load and a half. 


					  MR. ZADIR 
				(laughing) 
		   Thank you, Doug! 


   The guys and girls exit.   
CUT TO: 


   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER 


   The guys are entertaining the girls with their killer 
   impression of Hall & Oates. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
				(singing) 
		   ... Oh, oh, here she comes... 


   The guys do a "here she comes" step. 


					  STEVE 
		   Watch out, boy, she'll chew you 
		   up. 


   Doug chews. 


					  STEVE 
		   Whoa, here she comes... 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   She's a maneater! 


   The girls look blankly at them.  The guys stop. 


					  DOUG 
		   Guess who that was? 


					  VIVICA 
		   I have no idea. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well, I was supposed to have a 
		   moustache. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Sonny and Cher? 


					  STEVE 
		   Okay, we'll give you another hint. 


   The guys get into their Hall and Oates positions. 


					  STEVE 
				(singing) 
		   She's a rich girl. 


					  DOUG 
				(singing) 
		   And she's going to go far 'cause 
		   she knows it doesn't matter 
		   anyway. 


   Cambi stands. 


					  CAMBI 
				(shutting them up) 
		   Guys, guys!  I have an idea.  You 
		   want to have some fun? 


					  DOUG 
		   Sure, fun is our last name. 


					  STEVE 
		   Plus, fun spelled backwards is 
		   'nuf.'  And you can never have 
		   'nuf' fun. 


					  VIVICA 
				(takes Steve by the hand) 
		   Great.  Let's go. 


					  STEVE 
		   Where we going? 


					  VIVICA 
		   They're staying in here.  And 
		   we're going in there. 


   Vivica pulls Steve into an adjoining guest bedroom. 


					  DOUG 
				(as the door shuts) 
		   Steve! 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug! 


   INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Vivica sits on the bed.  Steve awkwardly stands by the 
   door. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Nice room. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, it's great. 
				(yelling at door) 
		   Doug, you should check out this 
		   room! 


					  VIVICA 
		   I think he's busy. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm just a big believer in 
		   sharing. 


   Vivica sensually lies back on the bed, staring at Steve. 
   Steve is uncomfortable, starts walking around. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Steve, why don't you come over 
		   here? 


   Vivica pats the bed a few times, inviting him over. 
   Steve watches.  Thinks.  Then goes over to the bed and 
   also pats it a few times, turning it into a drum solo. 


					  VIVICA 
				(stopping him) 
		   Steve! 


   Steve stops, looks at her. 


					  STEVE 
		   Viv, you know what I heard when I 
		   first met you? 


					  VIVICA 
		   What? 


   Steve starts making a very loud inappropriate shrill 
   ambulance siren sound -- over and over. 


					  VIVICA 
		   What are you doing? 


   Steve stops. 


					  STEVE 
		   That's an ambulance.  Coming to 
		   take me away because the sight of 
		   you just stopped my heart. 


   Steve is very proud of his comment, and makes another 
   siren sound.

   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug is sitting next to Cambi, trying to think of 
   something to say. 


					  DOUG 
				(trying to be suave) 
		   So, Cambi, can I ask you 
		   something?  Do you like 
		   blueberries or strawberries? 


					  MR. CAMBI 
		   Why? 


					  DOUG 
		   I want to know what type of 
		   pancakes to order you in the 
		   morning. 


   He looks proud of his line as we begin to hear Steve O.S. 
   -- from the next room -- making more SIREN SOUNDS, over 
   and over. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know, I was wondering... 
				(snaps, annoyed at 
				 siren sound) 
		   Steve! 


					  STEVE (O.S.) 
				(stops siren sound) 
		   ... Sorry! 


					  DOUG 
		   I was wondering... 


   Doug starts looking at Cambi's shirt label. 


					  CAMBI 
		   What are you doing? 


					  DOUG 
		   Checking your label.  Just as I 
		   thought.  Made in heaven. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Doug, you've gotten past the 
		   opening line. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, is that a mirror in your 
		   pocket? 


					  CAMBI 
		   What? 


					  DOUG 
		   'Cause I can see myself in your 
		   pants. 


					  CAMBI

   Vivica is bored.

				(yelling at the door) 
		   Steve, did you hear that? 
				(to Cambi) 
		   You don't even know how funny that 
		   is.  You are funny.  You don't

   INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Vivica is inches away from Steve's mouth. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vivica, I've been thinking.  Our

		   strong now.  We've had some great 
		   times together that I'll never 
		   forget.  Remember when I saw you 
		   at the pool? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Yeah? 


					  STEVE 
		   So, I was just remembering back. 
				(sighs) 
		   You know, an open dialogue is an 
		   essential element to any 
		   successful long term relationship. 
		   I think we have something special 
		   going on here and I don't want to 
		   move too fast. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Is this your first time? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yes.  Isn't it yours? 


   Vivica smiles and pounces on Steve, knocking him OUT OF 
   FRAME.

		   I just! 


					  STEVE

					  DOUG 
		   This is historical!  This what

   They high-five.  Doug suddenly catches himself,  changes 
   back to cool attitude -- Steve follows. 


					  DOUG 
		   Not that it hasn't happened before. 


					  STEVE 
		   Of course not. 


					  DOUG 
		   I mean it was alright. 


					  STEVE 
		   The usual. 


   They stand there, posing cool, but awkward for a beat. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm gonna go back in the --

   They run back in the bedrooms.

					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was great. 


					  STEVE 
		   I know.  Are we A club people now? 


   Doug looks at him -- then to answer, he pulls out a small 
   piece of paper, shows it to Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   You got a number!  Wooo! 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Woo!  We got a number! 


   They jump up and down, embracing, happy as hell.

   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - NEXT DAY 


   Doug is working feverishly at his desk.  There are phone 
   books, rolodex, staplers, notepads in front of him. 
   Steve enters with a shopping bag. 


					  DOUG 
		   Where have you been?  We've got to 
		   get ready for our business meeting 
		   with Mr. Zadir? 


					   STEVE 
		    I got some great new supplies for 
		    our business. 


   Steve starts pulling items out of the bag,  Doug doesn't 
   pay attention. 


					  STEVE 
		   'Post Its' to annotate important 
		   documents.  'Little Post Its' 
		   'cause you write smaller than me. 
		   'While you were out' pads -- for 
		   while you are out.  Scotch tape, 
		   in case the Post Its lose their 
		   adhesive-osity.  And mugs with our 
		   names on them.  Yours says, 
		   'Doug.' 


   Doug turns around. 


					  DOUG 
		   Okay, here's what we're gonna do. 


					  STEVE 
				(interrupting) 
		   Did you call Mr. Zadir? 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve, before you talk to a man like 
		   Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully 
		   developed plan of attack.  You have 
		   to have all your ducks in row. 


					  STEVE 
		   I didn't know to get ducks. 


					  DOUG 
		   That's an expression. 


					  STEVE 
		   So, we're going back to the dance 
		   club idea? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  Now you set up the office. 
		   I'm gonna call some real estate 
		   people to talk about locations. 
		   At that point, I'd like to 
		   schedule a meeting.  Can you do 
		   tweleve thirty. 


   Doug checks his Filofax.  Steve unwraps a new Filofax and 
   starts looking through it. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm clear. 


					  DOUG 
		   Great.  Be prepared to discuss 
		   possible club names and themes. 


					  STEVE 
		   What about music? 


					  DOUG 
		   We'll have to schedule another 
		   meeting for that.  Hey, you know 
		   what?  Maybe we should have a pre- 
		   meeting to brainstorm before our 
		   scheduled meeting. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah.  That way we won't look like 
		   idiots at our meeting. 


					  DOUG 
		   Exactly.  Okay, I'm gonna roll a 
		   few calls.  We should order in. 


					  STEVE 
		   I can take care of that. 
				(to door) 
		   Ma! 


   Doug pulls out the phone, starts dialing.  Steve starts 
   organizing the desk. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah? 


					  DOUG 
		   I was just thinking.  Dad would 
		   really be proud of us right now. 


   They both smile.  Mrs. Butabi enters. 

  
					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   Boys, your father's furious.  You 
		   were supposed to be at work an 
		   hour ago. 


					  DOUG 
		   Alright, we're gonna have to do 
		   some re-scheduling.

   INT. SILK PLANT STORE -AFTERNOON 


   Doug, behind cash register, holding clipboard, on the 
   phone.			    


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, hello, I'm interested in your 
		   sound systems.  I've heard good  
		   things about your woofers and    
		   tweeters. 
	   


   Steve walks over. 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, I... 


					  DOUG 
		   I'm on a call. 


   Steve nods, knowing what to do.  He pulls a Post-It, 
   writes something down and sticks it on Doug's clipboard. 
   A LADY walks up with a small plant.  Doug puts a	"Register Closed" sign on the counter.  The Lady leaves 
   and we FOLLOW her TO Mr. Butabi.	  


					  LADY 
		   Mr. Butabi, where is the other 
		   cash register? 


   MR. BUTABI'S POV 


   Cash register.  There are several Post-Its stuck to the 
   counter.  Steve is filling out another one. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I'll be with you in a second, Mrs. 
		   Manicotti. 


   Mr. Butabi goes over to the cash register. 


					  DOUG 
		   One second, Dad. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   It's good to see you're on a 
		   break.  I mean, after all, you've 
		   been here almost twenty minutes 
		   now and it's hard work listening 
		   to your walking man and ringing up 
		   the one customer you've had. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   This is a very nice sign.  Except for 
		   one thing. 
				(exploding) 
		   This is the only register!  This is 
		   why I pay you -- to push a button and 
		   take the money.  Is that too much? 
		   Is there some problem I don't know 
		   about?  Did you injure your button 
		   pushing finger in a bad cell phone 
		   accident? 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, why don't you go to Rexall's 
		   Drug Store.  I think you need to 
		   purchase a bottle of chill pills. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Just when I thought I had you doing 
		   the absolute minimum, you astound me 
		   with how much less you can do. 


					  DOUG 
		   For your information, Dad, we are 
		   working our asses off. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, our week's filling up pretty 
		   quick. 


					  DOUG 
		   Dad, last night, Steve and I 
		   happen to have made a very 
		   important business contact. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Oh, what are you dancing the 
		   Macarena with Donald Trump? 


					  STEVE 
		   Did you want me to go the drug 
		   store to get those pills? 


					  DOUG 
		   I think we should tell him now. 
				(excited) 
		   Dad, you're gonna love this.  We're 
		   working on this club idea which could 
		   include many silk plant opportunities 
		   and guess who we thought could be our 
		   supplier? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I need you to give me 
		   opportunities.  I feed you, I clothe 
		   you, I put a roof over your head and 
		   I pay for your little phones so you 
		   can call other idiots.  I give up on 
		   you two.  I am ashamed to call you my 
		   sons. 


					  DOUG 
		   There you go again, Dad.  You always 
		   tell us to do something with our 
		   lives and when we finally do, what 
		   happens?  You got to put us down. 
		   You never support us, you never 
		   encourage us, and you never care 
		   about what's important to us.  Right, 
		   Steve? 


					  STEVE 
		   Do you need a prescription for those 
		   pills? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   It's my own fault.  I spoil you. 
		   From now on, you are no longer 
		   allowed to go out to clubs at 
		   night. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   What? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Now enough wasting time.  Go clean 
		   up the stock room. 


					  DOUG 
		   You know what, Poppason, not only 
		   will Steve and I not clean the 
		   stock room, but we are officially 
		   out of here! 
				(to Steve) 
		   Come on. 


   Doug starts walking out. 


					  STEVE 
		   But what about the stock room? 


					  DOUG 
		   We quit! 
				(turns back to Dad) 
		   And we don't need you!  We made 
		   big contacts last night! 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, plus we met these girls, 
		   Dad, and you wouldn't believe what 
		   happened. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Dad) 
		   We're gonna make it without you. 
		   You'll see. 


   Doug exits, Steve follows him. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, I'll see tonight when you get 
		   hungry and you come home to eat my 
		   food.  And when you come crawling 
		   to me for more money! 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. SILK PLANT STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Doug and Steve barrel out the front door and head 
   straight for the van.  Emily, in a sexy sun dress, 
   carrying two big huge oversized lightbulbs where her 
   breasts would be, steps in front of them. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hey, Steve!  Do you want to go to 
		   the beach later?  I've got my 
		   bathing suit on under this. 


					  DOUG 
				(to Emily) 
		   Not now! 


   Doug blows by Emily.  Beat.  He steps back INTO FRAME -- 
   takes a second look at the odd bulb positions -- and 
   exits again.  The guys start getting into the van. 


					  EMILY 
		   I'm not talking to you, Doug. 
		   You're an ass. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, we're experiencing a major 
		   family crisis.  I'm gonna have to 
		   take a rain check on this convo. 


					  DOUG 
		   Steve!  Car! 


					  STEVE 
				(as he gets into 
				 the car) 
		   Nice bulbs, Emily. 


   Steve gets in.  They PEEL OUT. 


					  EMILY 
				(yells after them) 
		   So, you want to go out tonight? 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   The guys speed along on their way to Butabi.  Doug is 
   looking over a sheet of paper. 


					  DOUG 
		   Okay, these are the ideas we'll 
		   pitch him.  The Jungle Paradise. 


					  STEVE 
		   Killer. 


					  DOUG 
		   The Inside Out Club. 


					  STEVE 
		   Money. 


					  DOUG 
		   The Civil War. 


					  STEVE 
		   That one needs work. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  We'll hold off on that one. 
		   And let's not forget our ace in 
		   the hole -- The Naked Room. 


					  STEVE 
		   I think we should call it 'The 
		   Nudist Colony.' 


					  DOUG 
		  That sounds like a strip club. 
		  And this is a dance club. 


					  STEVE 
		   You're right.  We'll go with 'The 
		   Naked Room.'

   EXT. ZADIR'S MANSION 


   The silk van drives up.  Steve and Doug get out and walk 
   up to the locked gate. 


					  DOUG 
		   Zadir's gonna be excited to see 
		   us.  This is it, bro... 


   Doug presses the intercom.  They wait. 


					  STEVE 
		   This is it. 


   Doug presses the intercom buzzer again.  No response.  As 
   they wait, Steve starts to sing to himself. 


					  STEVE 
				(very softly) 
		   'This is it, make your mistakes 
		   where you are.  This is it...' 


   We realize Steve is singing "This Is It" by Kenny 
   Loggins.  Doug slowly joins in as they pass the time. 


					  STEVE/DOUG 
		   '... We're going no further.' 


   The both step singing as Doug hits the buzzer again. 
   After a beat of waiting, Steve picks up the song where 
   they left off... 


					  STEVE 
				(soloing much louder) 
		   'Here!  The moment is now, no 
		   place for goodbyes...' 


   INTERCOM 


   Male voice starts singing the next lyric. 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   'And now I'm not so sure... doo 
		   doo... deep in my heart...' 


					  DOUG/STEVE/INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   This is it! 


   BACK TO SCENE 


   They stop singing. 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   You guys know 'Footloose'? 


					  DOUG 
				(running to 
				 intercom) 
		   Actually, we're here to see Mr. 
		   Zadir.  It's Steve and Doug Butabi. 


					  STEVE 
				(softly to himself) 
		   '... pick up your Sunday shoes...' 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   Mr. Zadir's not here. 


					  STEVE 
		   We were supposed to have a meeting 
		   with him about our ideas.  Like 
		   there's one where the inside is 
		   outside and there's one about a 
		   jungle and... 


					  DOUG 
				(shutting him up, 
				 covering the 
				 intercom) 
		   Steve!  Never talk concepts with 
		   the intercom. 
			    (to intercom) 
		   Can we come inside and wait for 
		   him? 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Can we leave him a message? 


					  INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   No. 


					  STEVE 
				(to Doug) 
		   Let's just forget it. 


					  DOUG 
		   Stay strong, sailor. 
				(to intercom) 
		   Do you know where we can find him? 


					 INTERCOM (V.O.) 
		   He's at the office in Wilshire. 


   They jump in the car and drive off.

   We see a large engraved marble "Zadir Industries" sign 
   above the entrance. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. ELEVATOR - LATER 


   We see each elevator button is the name of Zadir's many 
   businesses (Zadir Dry Cleaners, Zadir Beepers, Zadir 
   Gaming & Entertainment, Zadir Real Estate, Executive 
   Suite). 


   DOUG AND STEVE 


   listen to a MUZAK VERSION of "WHAT IS LOVE" by Haddaway. 
   Their heads begin to bop very slowly.  A hot-looking 
   businesswoman gets on.  They guys smile politely and wait 
   patiently.  We hear a DING.  The businesswoman gets off. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, Steve, did you notice we 
		   forgot to ask her something? 


					  STEVE 
		   You mean, 'What's up?' 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah.  That's weird. 


					  STEVE 
		   Actually, it's not.  We're both 
		   involved in serious relationships 
		   now, and our ladies know they can 
		   trust us.  'Trust' being the key 
		   element in any worthwhile 
		   commitment. 


					  DOUG 
		   Why go out for burgers when we've 
		   got steak at home? 


					  STEVE 
		   You're right.  We should get lunch 
		   after this. 


   INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES - RECEPTION - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Elevator doors open.  Doug and Steve exit onto a very 
   modern white glass floor. 


   RECEPTION AREA 


   Doug and Steve walk over to a RECEPTIONIST. 


					  DOUG 
		   Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. 
		   Zadir. 


					  RECEPTIONIST 
		   You're brothers? 


   Doug and Steve give each other a look.  They're tempted 
   to tell their "brother joke." 


					  DOUG 
		   Ma'am, thanks for the setup, but 
		   we really can't get into that 
		   right now. 


   Steve looks down the hall of offices to his left. 


   STEVE'S POV 


   At the end of the hall, Mr. Zadir and Dooey quickly walk 
   by. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  STEVE 
		   Doug, Mr. Zadir! 


   The guys run down the hall. 


					  RECEPTIONIST 
		   Hey, you can't...! 


   HALLWAY 


   The guys run past office files, they pass a Fed Ex woman. 
   Steve stops in his tracks. 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
		   but I'm in a serious relationship 
		   right now. 


   Steve immediately jumps back into full stride. 


   END OF HALLWAY 


   The guys turn a corner. 


   CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR 


   As Dooey closes the door, we see Mr. Zadir at the head of 
   a board meeting.  Zadir does not see them.  Dooey turns 
   around. 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Dooey!  My very main man.  Up top! 


   The guys raise their hands to high five. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER 


   Dooey forcefully drags the guys by their shirts, through 
   the door and towards the elevators. 


					  STEVE 
				(sincere) 
		   So, Dooey, how's everything goin'? 


					  DOUG 
		   Ragin' party last night. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Yeah, is that what my mother said 
		   to you... 
			    (indicating he heard 
				them in the limo) 
		   ... or was it my father? 


   Dooey drops the guys next to the elevator, presses the 
   down button, begins to walk away. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, Zadir wants to have this 
		   meeting by the elevators? 


   Dooey stops and slowly turns around. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit 
		   last night.  I was out till four in 
		   the morning trying to find more. 


					  STEVE 
				(impressed) 
		   From dusk 'til dawn -- you, sir, are 
		   a party animal. 


					  DOOEY 
				(threatening) 
		   Don't go near Mr. Zadir.  He was 
		   drunk last night and he doesn't even 
		   remember you.  You think you're the 
		   first losers he's picked up that I've 
		   had to get rid of come Monday? 


					  DOUG 
		   Uh... Doo-man, I don't know if I'm 
		   reading my diss-meter correctly. 
		   Because are we being blown off. 


					  DOOEY 
		   Just stay away if you know what's 
		   good for you. 


   Dooey walks away.  The guys are in shock for a beat. 
   Suddenly, Doug bolts full speed past Dooey and back into 
   the office.  Dooey follows. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR 


   Doug runs up to the shut door and starts banging.  No 
   response.  He notices, to the left, a glass window 
   looking into the conference room. 


   DOUG'S POV 


   Zadir looks up -- we can't tell if he sees Doug or not. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


   Suddenly, two burly security guys pull Doug away. 


							   CUT TO: 


   EXT. ZADIR'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATER 


   The security guys physically push the guys out the 
   building. 


					  STEVE 
				(to security) 
		   Alright, so we'll see you guys later. 


   The security guys, unfazed, walk back in. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. VAN - LATER 


   The guys get in and sit there, depressed.  After a 
   beat... 


					  STEVE 
		   What do you want to do? 


					  DOUG 
		   I can't talk to you right now. 
		   Give me a second. 


					  STEVE 
		   Maybe we should just go back to 
		   work. 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, and maybe we should just go 
		   to college and not put gel in our 
		   hair and starts wearing blue jeans. 
		   Let's do that, Steve! 


					  STEVE 
		   ... Sorry. 


   Steve suddenly gets an idea and reaches into the glove 
   compartment.  He pulls out the piece of paper with 
   Cambi's number on it -- we see he's put it in a small 
   lucite frame. 


					  STEVE 
			    (trying to cheer 
				 Doug up) 
		   Cambi's number. 


   Doug looks up at the number, starts to come out of his 
   funk. 


					  STEVE 
		   We had a sweet time last night, 
		   didn't we? 


					 DOUG 
		   Sweet ass time. 


					  STEVE 
		   Diabetic.  I could see doing that 
		   again, maybe even a couple a times 
		   a week, right? 


					  DOUG 
		   The ladies await, my friend.  Cell! 


   Steve slaps a cellular phone into Doug's hand.  Steve 
   looks down, shifts again, they pull out.

   INT. MONDRIAN SKYBAR - LATER 


   Cambi and Vivica are standing by the bar, talking to

					 AKIRO

		   Sweet ass. 


   We hear a PAGER GO OFF in Cambi's bag.  She checks the 
   beeper.

				(frustrated) 
		   Steve, you have to hit the pound 
		   sign or it doesn't go through. 
				(sighs) 
		   Maybe their phones aren't working. 


					  STEVE 
		   Try putting in our number and then 
		   hitting pound.

					  DOUG 
		   Long-term relationship good? 


					  STEVE 
		   It's totally committed.  You know, 
		   Doug, when things aren't going so 
		   well, it really makes you realize 
		   how much your woman means to you. 


							   CUT TO: 


  INT. SKYBAR - DAY 


  Steve and Doug enter and are hit with the unwelcome sight 
  of their girls flirting with the businessmen.  They strut 
  over, ready to fight. 


					  DOUG 
		   These guys bothering you? 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hi, Doug. 


					  DOUG 
				(to businessmen) 
		   You guys messing with our women. 


					  JAPANESE GUYS 
				(in Japanese) 
		   What's up? 


					  DOUG 
		   You want to mix it up?  Come on! 
		   Take me on.  I'm insane.  You 
		   don't know what you're dealing with. 


   The businessmen look at them strangely. 


					  STEVE 
		   Vivica, I'm feeling a little 
		   vulnerable here.  I thought we had 
		   an understanding.  And I can't 
		   believe you're willing to just 
		   throw away everything we've been 
		   to each other? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and 
		   Toronaga... they're my cousins. 


   Steve is relieved, Doug is mistrustful. 


					  STEVE 
			   (holding out hand to 
			    shake) 
		   Oh!  Well, it's about time that we 
		   met the family. 


					  DOUG 
			    (pulling to Steve's 
				hand back) 
		   Come on!  What do you think, we're 
		   stupid?  How can they be your 
		   cousins? 


					  VIVICA 
			    (like talking to a 
				child) 
		   Well, his mother and my mother are 
		   sisters and that makes us cousins. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Oh.  Okay. 


					  CAMBI 
			    (to Akiro and 
				 Toronaga) 
		   Would you excuse us a second? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yeah, we just got to talk to them 
		   a second. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, 'cause we slept with them 
		   last night so...

  EXT. MONDRIAN - SIDEWALK - DAY 


  Cambi and Vivica, Steve, Doug assemble near the Silk van. 


					  CAMBI 
		   So, did you guys have as good a 
		   time last night as we did? 


					  STEVE 
		   I had a great time, Vivica.  In 
		   fact, I think we've reached the 
		   point where I can comfortably call 
		   you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.' 


					  DOUG 
		   So, you guys want to hang out or 
		   see a movie or do what we did last 
		   night... or eat or... just do what 
		   we did last night or hang out, eat 
		   and then do what we did last night 
		   or... you know, whatever... and do 
		   what we did last night. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Sounds good. 


   Cambi gives Doug a kiss.  He melts, then quickly tries to 
   act cool.  Vivica affectionately holds Steve's arm. 


					  STEVE 
		   Viv, I'm glad our relationship is 
		   strong enough to withstand the 
		   hard times -- like when were 
		   just in the bar -- I also think 
		   we're not just projecting onto one 
		   another but dealing with the 
		   reality of who we are.  And most 
		   important, we know how to listen. 


					  VIVICA 
		   What? 


					  CAMBI 
		   Hey, you boys want to go somewhere 
		   quiet? 


   The girls look at them seductively. 


					  DOUG 
		   No... 


					  DOUG/STEVE 
		   Yes! 


					  STEVE 
				(in reference to 
				 joke) 
		   It's gold.  I'm telling you. 


   The guys high five and laugh -- they walk to the van. 
   Doug opens the passenger door. 


					  DOUG 
		   Ladies, have your boarding passes 
		   ready. 


   Cambi and Vivica just stand there. 


					  CAMBI 
		   What are you doing? 


					  STEVE 
		   Aisle or window seat?  I'm sorry, 
		   ma'am, you're gonna have to check 
		   that bag... The movie on this 
		   flight will be uh... I don't know. 
		   I can't think of any more. 


					  VIVICA 
		   Where's your car? 


					  DOUG 
		   Our dad got mad and took it away. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Your dad? 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, we used to work for him, but 
		   we quit today so actually we're 
		   unemployed. 


					  VIVICA 
		   You're not in business with Mr. 
		   Zadir? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, we are.  But, not now.  We 
		   just met him last night.  But, we 
		   will be.  So, no, but, yes. 


					  STEVE 
		   Especially, if we ever get to see 
		   him again. 


   The girls digest this for a beat.  Cambi signals to 
   Vivica and they both start walking back to the bar.  The 
   guys, confused, run up to them. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, we were just kidding about 
		   those boarding passes.  You can 
		   get in. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Get away from us. 


					  DOUG 
		   What's going on? 


					  CAMBI 
		   You guys are a big waste of time. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... Como what? 


					  VIVICA 
		   Steve, you're a jerkoff. 


					  STEVE 
		   Well, I'm glad you shared that 
		   with me.  That's a big step for 
		   the both of us. 


					  CAMBI 
		   Guys, consider what we did with 
		   you last night a favor.  Now do us 
		   a favor and never talk to us 
		   again! 


					  DOUG 
		   What did we do wrong?  We'll 
		   change. 


					  VIVICA 
		   No, you can't change.  You and 
		   your brother are ugly pathetic 
		   losers. 
				(to Cambi) 
		   That's the problem with 
		   nightclubs.  Poor schmucks look 
		   just the same as rich schmucks. 


   The girls walk back to the bar.  The guys watch them go. 


					  CAMBI 
				(as they walk) 
		   I can't believe we actually had 
		   sex with those asswads.  I hope 
		   the nips are still at the bar. 


   The girls disappear into the bar.  The guys stand in 
   shock, trying to absorb the ultimate rejection.

   EXT. FREEWAY - LATER 


   Slow-moving congestion.  We see the Silk van driving in 
   the middle of it. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK VAN - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   Doug and Steve sit in silence for a while. 


					  STEVE 
				(trying to cheer 
				 him up) 
		   Hey, Doug, I think some of the 
		   plants are beginning to wilt... 
		   no, I'm just kidding.  They're 
		   made out of silk. 


   Doug doesn't respond. 


					  STEVE 
				(singing quietly) 
		   ... 'This is it.' 


					  DOUG 
				(cutting him off) 
		   Steve!  This is the worst day of 
		   my life.  So, if you don't mind, I 
		   really don't want to hear you talk 
		   right now. 


					  STEVE 
		   Well, it hasn't been the Super Bowl 
		   for me either... 
				(mumbling) 
		   ... just trying to get you to talk. 


					  DOUG 
				(blowing up) 
		   Talk?!  You want me to talk, Steve?! 
		   I'll talk.  Blah-blah-blah, talk, 
		   talk, talk!  I'm talking!  You feel 
		   better now?!  Talk! 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't really know how to respond to 
		   that. 


					  DOUG 
				(ripping into him) 
		   Oh, big surprise, Steve.  You don't 
		   know how to do something.  You don't 
		   know how to work the clubs, you don't 
		   know how to talk to women.  The only 
		   thing you know how to do is ask me 
		   how to do everything! 


					  STEVE 
		   But, I -- 


					  DOUG 
		   That's why everthing's gone 
		   wrong... 'cause you're holding me 
		   back. 
		   


					  DOUG (CONT'D) 
		   You're so needy all the time. 
		   You're like this thing tied to my 
		   leg, like this... dragging 
		   thing... 


					  STEVE 
		   A lead weight? 


					  DOUG 
		   Yes, a lead weight. 
				(sincere) 
		   Thanks. 
				(back to angry) 
		   And I am not letting you drag me 
		   down anymore. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... You know, can't blame me for 
		   what happened.  Today was a series 
		   of random events gone awry. 


					  DOUG 
		   Maybe events wouldn't go awry if I 
		   had someone with a brain sitting 
		   next to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh, yeah.  Well, maybe I'd have 
		   better events if I was with 
		   someone with a higher level of 
		   looks and taller. 


   Doug, in shock, starts to hyperventilate from anger. 


					  DOUG 
				(breathing heavily) 
		   I'm tall enough to kick your ass. 


					  STEVE 
				(cupping his ear) 
		   Did you say something?  It's hard 
		   to hear things that low down to 
		   the ground. 


					  DOUG 
		   Well hear this.  Consider me your 
		   ex-brother. 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't care. 


					  DOUG 
		   You care about this? 


   Doug fakes throwing a punch -- Steve flinches.  Steve 
   fake punches -- Doug flinches. 


					  DOUG 
		   You want the real thing?! 


					  STEVE 
		   No. 


					  DOUG 
		   Then stop talking to me. 


					  STEVE 
		   My pleasure. 


   They continue along in silence, both looking miserable.

   EXT. BUTABI HOUSE - NEXT MORNING 


   We see the Silk van parked in front of the house. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 


   Steve lies on his bed looking out the window.  Doug's 
   bed is empty. 


   STEVE'S POV 


   We see Doug carrying all his clothes into the Butabi 
   guest cottage. 


   STEVE 


   is sad.  Gets up, walks to Doug's desk and throws all the 
   Post-its and business supplies in the trash. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. BUTABI GUEST COTTAGE - CONTINOUS ACTION 


   A simple studio.  Doug dumps his belongings on the bed -- 
   bottles of hair gel, colognes, aftershaves, etc.  He 
   picks up Cambi's framed number, yanks it out of the frame 
   and rips it to shreds.  Then he sits back on the bed, 
   picks up remote and turns the TELEVISION ON. 


   TELEVISION SCREEN 


   Oddly enough, it's a rerun of "21 Jump Street" featuring 
   Richard Greico. 


   BACK TO SCENE 


					  DOUG 
		   Lies!  All lies! 


   Doug shuts it OFF. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. SILK PLANT STORE - DAY 


   A depressed Steve is emotionally selling a plant to a 
   female customer. 


					  STEVE 
				(sadly) 
		   That's right, ma'am.  It's silk. 
		   It'll always be in bloom.  It'll 
		   never change.  It'll never die. 
		   It'll never yell at you and call 
		   you a 'loser.'  It'll always be in 
		   your room where you left it, not 
		   suddenly move out into the guest 
		   house. 


   The customer is crying.  Mr. Butabi walks over, pulls 
   Steve aside. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   What are you doing?  All the 
		   customers are depressed. 


					  STEVE 
				(looking over at 
				 empty register) 
		   I'm just used to seeing Doug at 
		   the register.  I miss him. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   But he's only in the guest house. 
		   It's ten feet away.  It's like a 
		   mansion in there. 


					  STEVE 
		   There's no cable. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   There is Cinemax. 


					  STEVE 
				(crying) 
		   But, there's no H.B.O. 


   Steve walks off, upset. 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. CRUNCH GYM - DAY 


   Emily, in skin-tight shiny body suit, is exercising on 
   the Peck Deck portion of a Nautilus machine -- filled 
   with people.  She finishes her last repetitions. 


					  EMILY 
		   Nine... ten. 


   She stops.  Then looks in a little workout book entitled 
   Diet to Get Steve. 


					  EMILY 
		   Okay.  One more set.  Add ten 
		   pounds. 


   She bends down and pulls the metal pin out of the 
   weights.  The person next to her, using the lat bar, goes 
   flying up. 


					  EMILY 
		   Whoops.  Sorry.  Wrong pin. 


   EMILY'S POV 


   Steve is doing sit-ups on a slant board.  Craig spots 
   him. 


   CRAIG AND STEVE 


   Steve is straining, in mid-crunch.  Craig is eating a 
   Power Bar. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Not the neck -- the stomach.  Not 
		   the thighs -- the stomach.  Not 
		   the shoulders - the... Oh my God! 


					  STEVE 
		   What? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Ab citing!  Six pack in full 
		   effect. 


					  STEVE 
		   Where! 


   Steve rushes to mirror, holds up his shirt.  Craig 
   points. 


					  CRAIG 
		   There she cuts. 


   Emily enters. 


					  EMILY 
		   Hi, Steve.  Is that an ab? 


					  CRAIG 
				(noticing Emily's 
				 body) 
		   Toned and tight, Emily.  Want to 
		   power up? 


   He offers her a bite of his bar.  She ignores him.  Craig 
   stands there chewing a Power Bar and drinking an "Ultra 
   Fuel" while they talk. 


					  EMILY 
		   I heard about your brother. 


					  STEVE 
				(avoiding eye contact) 
		   What'd you hear about him? 


					  EMILY 
		   Your father said you and him quit, 
		   then you had a fight, then you 
		   came crawling back to work like he 
		   said you would and how your 
		   brother didn't. 


					  STEVE 
		   So? 


					  EMILY 
		   So, when are we going out? 


					  CRAIG 
		   I know a place with good spinach 
		   wraps? 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, Emily, I know you've had 
		   your heart set on this a long 
		   time, but, the truth is we're from 
		   two different worlds.  I mean, I'm 
		   a rebel... and you're kind of the 
		   sweet girl next door type. 


					  EMILY 
		   Steve, I work next door.  It's not 
		   a type, it's a location. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know what I mean.  I don't 
		   know if you can handle a guy like 
		   me.  I'm used to more, like 
		   experienced women. 


					  EMILY 
		   Duh.  You're forgetting -- I got to 
		   college.  Translation -- drunken 
		   orgies with occasional Cliff 
		   Notes. 


					  CRAIG 
		   I know Cliff.  Weak delts. 


					  EMILY 
		   And I'm not one of those date rape 
		   crybabies. 


					  STEVE 
		   Look, it sounds good, but I'm 
		   getting over a very serious 
		   relationship right now.  It's 
		   gonna take some time to nurse 
		   my emotional wounds.  And that 
		   could take, like, until Saturday. 


					  EMILY 
		   Perfect, your dad bought us two 
		   tickets to David Copperfield, this 
		   Saturday. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'll let you know how I'm feeling. 


					  EMILY 
		   It'll be fun to see things appear, 
		   and then disappear. 


   Emily grabs his face and shoves her tongue down his 
   throat for a beat and pulls back. 


					  EMILY 
		   See ya. 


					  CRAIG 
				(watching Emily leave) 
		   Tight glutes. 
				(sincere) 
		   Steve, as a trainer.  I'm pretty 
		   perceptive about picking up body 
		   language... I think she likes you.

   The cottage is dark. 


   SUBTITLE:  ONE WEEK LATER 


   Doug is unshaven, unkempt.  Disinterestedly flipping 
   channels.  He throws the remote away. 


					 DOUG 
		   ... Fine!  I won't watch Larry 
		   Sanders! 


   Gets up and exits.  We hear the VAN PEEL OUT. 


   Seperation MONTAGE BEGINS: 


							   CUT TO: 


   MONTAGE 


   A)   INT. DAVID COPPERFIELD SHOW - NIGHT 


	  David Copperfield is on stage doing a pseudo-sexy 
	  trick.  In the audience, Steve tries to subtly work 
	  his arm behind Emily.  She notices, grabs his hand, 
	  and plants it on her breast. 


							   CUT TO: 


   B)  INT. DISCO - NIGHT 


	  Doug is drunk, trying to dance with a girl.  She

	  a biker guy -- who tries to dance with him. 


							   CUT TO: 


   C)  EXT. BUTABI GUEST COTTAGE -NIGHT 


	  The dogs are dragging a dead deer across the 
	  driveway.  Suddenly, the Silk van pulls in too fast, 
	  runs over some plants and smashes over a chaise 
	  lounge chair.  The van stops and Doug, literally, 
	  falls out of the van and onto the ground.  He lies 
	  there. 


							   CUT TO: 


   D)  INT. SILK STORE DAY

	  air mattress. 


   G)  BACK TO SCENE 


	  Doug sprays the window with whipped cream to block 
	  the view. 


   END OF MONTAGE 


							   CUT TO: 


   INT. DOUG AND STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT 


   Steve and Emily are in bed -- pre-sex.  Steve is in a 
   pajama top.  Emily is in a black nightie and flipping 
   through a USC School of Business course guide.  Steve 
   kisses her neck, Emily keeps reading.  Steve reaches over 
   and puts his hand on her breast.  Emily keeps reading. 
   He pulls his hand back. 


					  EMILY 
		   Here's one -- 'Business Computer	
		   Systems.' 


					  STEVE 
				(disinterested) 
		   I'm not real good with machines. 
		   That was Doug's thing.  I'm more 
		   of a people person. 


					  EMILY 
		   Steve, a businessman has to have a 
		   knowledge of computers.  Ooo!  -- 
		   'Venture Management and Analysis.' 
		   you have to take that. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, my dad's giving me the 
		   store anyway.  I don't really have 
		   to go back to school. 


					  EMILY 
		   One store?  Yah... and maybe 
		   we'll just have like one house and 
		   one car.  Steve, we're gonna have 
		   more than one store.  And you have 
		   to be prepared. 


					  STEVE 
		   I don't really want to go back to 
		   school.  I'll have to read. 


					  STEVE (CONT'D) 
		   And homework and teachers always 
		   asking you if you'd like to share 
		   that with the rest of the class. 


					  EMILY 
		   Don't upset me.  Unless you want 
		   to make me less horny. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, that wouldn't be good. 


					  EMILY 
				(kissing him) 
		   Look, first, we combine the 
		   stores, plants and lamps, then we 
		   can add furniture, you know 
		   recliners... 


   Emily climbs on top of him, and rubs herself against him. 


					  EMILY 
		   ... sofas and tables and... 
		   and... 


   She moans. 


					  STEVE 
		   ... chairs? 


					  EMILY 
		   Oh, yes!  Chairs and wastepaper 
		   baskets and... and... 


					  STEVE 
		   Ah!... Ottomans! 


   Emily rips Steve's pajama top off, as she rides him. 


					  EMILY 
				(progressively 
				 getting closer 
				 to orgasm) 
		   And then we'll open a second store 
		   in Orange County with dinette sets 
		   and entertainment centers, and a 
		   third in San Francisco and then 
		   we'll be bigger than Ikea, oh my 
		   God... Home Depot!  I, I, Ikeaaa! 


   Emily orgasms and slides off Steve. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, I'm sort of feeling, you 
		   know, like we're moving too fast. 
		   You're talking like we're married. 


					  EMILY 
				(taking it as a 
				 proposal) 
		   Oh my God!  Steve!  You've made me 
		   so happy! 


   She hugs him. 


					  STEVE 
				(upset) 
		   What?  No, no.  I meant... 


   Emily quickly ducks OUT OF FRAME to perform oral sex on 
   STEVE -- who quickly stops being upset.

					 DOUG

					  CRAIG 
		   Your brother's wedding?  What are you 
		   gonna wear? 


					  DOUG 
				(dropping head to 
				 table) 
		   Oh, God. 


					  CRAIG 
		   You got to hand it to Steve.  That 
		   Emily's the perfect woman.  Strong 
		   legs, low body fat, and a positive 
		   mental attitude.  A lady like that 
		   can really keep you on track.  Is it 
		   okay to wear black at an afternoon 
		   affair? 


					  DOUG 
		   Shut up, you idiot. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Doug, I know you and your brother 
		   are having some problems, but that 
		   is no reason to refer to my 
		   intellectual capacity in a 
		   diminutive manner. 


					  DOUG 
		   I'm sorry, Craig, but you totally 
		   Wolf Blitzerd me with the 
		   matrimony update.  Do you mind if 
		   we just don't talk about my 
		   brother? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Ten-Four.  Boundary set. 


					  DOUG 
				(perking himself 
				 back up) 
		   Look, did we come here for some 
		   Starbucks' latte chitchat or did 
		   we come here to hit on hotties? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Hotties. 


					  DOUG 
		   Let's do it. 


   They move out. 


   BAR 


   The guys walk over to the back of a blonde woman. 


					 DOUG 
		   Hey, sweetness, what's up? 


   The woman turns around -- it's ELLEN DEGENERES. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hey, fine thing, you got it going 
		   on. 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   Thank you.  I was worried. 


					  DOUG 
		   So, you want to shake it? 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   No, I think I'll just let it sit. 


					  DOUG 
		   You sure? 


					  ELLEN DEGENERES 
		   Now that I've met you, I'm more 
		   sure than I've ever been. 


   Ellen walks away. 


					  CRAIG 
		   That was a...

   INT. BUTABI DINING ROOM - NIGHT 


   Filled with the entire Butabi and Anderson family, 
   including old folks.  This is the pre-wedding rehearsal 
   dinner. 


					  MRS. BUTABI 
		   And the hors d'oeuvers are hummus 
		   dip and babaganoush... 


					  MABEL 
		   Who's going to eat that?  You 
		   should have pigs in the blanket 
		   and chicken fingers. 


   Steve is sticking a spoon on his nose.  Mr. Butabi takes 
   it and taps his glass, standing up. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Okay.  A toast to Steve and Emily, 
		   who after tommorow will be Mr. and 
		   Mrs. Steve Butabi. 


					  EMILY 
		   Emily Anderson-Butabi. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Really.  Okay.  Well... to whoever 
		   they turn out to be. 


					  FRED 
				(standing up) 
		   I would also like to thank 
		   everyone for flying in to join us. 
		   My brother and his wife from 
		   Chicago.  My parents who came in 
		   all the way from Maine despite 
		   Mom's sciatica.  And the Butabis 
		   who came all the way in from Yee- 
		   men. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(correcting him) 
		   Yemen. 


					  FRED 
		   Wherever the hell that is.  I'm 
		   just kidding.  And that's not the 
		   only union I'm excited about. 
		   From what I understand, we got a 
		   new lamp/plant store. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   That's plant/lamp store.  Ha 
		   ha... that's a joke.  But, 
		   seriously, I think it sounds 
		   better. 


					  EMILY 
		   Steve, don't you want to make a 
		   toast? 


					  STEVE 
		   No, that's alright. 


					  EMILY 
				(pushing him up) 
		   All the men are doing it? 


					  STEVE 
				(standing) 
		   So, okay, uh... I just want to 
		   say... what's up... Grandpa, 
		   Grandma, and those other two old 
		   people. 


   Steve sits.  Emily quickly stands. 


					  EMILY 
		   I think what Steve means, is that, 
		   we're just thrilled with the way 
		   this family is coming together. 
		   And I'd like to share with you 
		   some of our business plans for 
		   after the merger. 
				(to Grandma) 
		   Can you pass these out? 


   Emily hands out business plan folders. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   I will get more wine. 


   Mr. Butabi is looking through a wine rack.  Steve enters. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we 
		   could cancel this whole thing? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Yes, sure... 
				(turns to Doug) 
		   ... Nooo! 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, that's so funny.  But I 
		   really don't want to get married. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You are serious?  All these people 
		   are here and you are serious? 


					  STEVE 
		   Dad, it's like, Emily had turned 
		   into this whole different person. 
		   I mean, at first, she was this 
		   girl that I really liked to have 
		   sex with.  Then she turned into 
		   this other girl who I really don't 
		   want to marry -- although I don't 
		   mind having sex with her. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Look, the catering is paid for. 
		   The tents are all set up.  Your 
		   grandparents flew half way around 
		   the world.  Besides, all men go 
		   through the same thing the night 
		   before their wedding. 


					  STEVE 
		   You mean, all guys feel sort of 
		   nervous and anxious, and kind of 
		   hope a train hits her and she eats 
		   a can of botulism or maybe she 
		   could hang out with a deer, and a 
		   hunter accidently shoots her or 
		   you know, when she's sleeping and 
		   she makes that nose whistle sound 
		   and you shake her to make it quiet 
		   but what you'd really like to do 
		   is take her stupid red toothbrush 
		   and ram it up her nostril into her 
		   skull. 


   Mr. Butabi stares at him for a beat. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Steve, these feelings are 
		   perfectly normal.

   DOUG'S POV 


   Wedding chairs.  Tents.  Flowers.  Suddenly, we hear a

				(making beeping sound)

					  STEVE 
				(assuming it's real) 
		   Doug, sorry I missed you.  I guess 
		   you heard I'm gettng married 
		   tommorow.  I was just wondering if

   Steve exits.  Doug peels through the window at him.

   EXT BUTABI BACK YARD - DAY 


   Beautiful wedding layout. 


   Guests mill about.  Craig is lifting an ice sculpture off 
   it's base.  Steve is next to him. 


					  STEVE 
		   Craig, I know you can lift it. 
		   Now can you just listen to me? 


					  CRAIG 
				(putting down 
				 sculpture) 
		   I got it.  I walk down the aisle. 
		   I stand next to you.  And I settle 
		   any inter-wedding party 
		   skirmishes. 


					  STEVE 
		   No, you're the best man.  Not the 
		   wedding bouncer.  You just gotta 
		   back me up. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Oh, you mean like spotting you? 


					  STEVE 
		   Exactly. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Now, I get it.  If things get too 
		   heavy, I step in.  Like a 
		   relationship spotter. 
				(overwhelmed) 
		   Thank you, man.  I won't let you 
		   down. 


   FATHER WILLIAMS, a grey-haired priest, Phil Donahue-type, 
   walks over. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Okay, boys, we're about ready to 
		   start.  You look very nice, 
		   Steven. 


					  STEVE 
		   Thank you, Father.  I love what 
		   you're wearing also. 


   He's in regular black priest garb.  He exits, confused. 


   BACK OF WEDDING AISLE 


   Steve walks up to Mr. Butabi, who is waiting with the 
   procession.  WEDDING MARCH BEGINS. 


					  STEVE 
		   You know, Dad, I've been thinking. 
		   I didn't really have time to have 
		   a bachelor party and that's a 
		   pretty important part of the 
		   marriage experience.  So, we may 
		   want to consider delaying the 
		   wedding a couple of hours so we 
		   can go to a strip club or 
		   something. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Sh!  We're starting. 


   WEDDING AISLE 


   Richard Grieco, in tux, walks down the aisle with a 
   frumpy BRIDESMAID. 


					  BRIDESMAID 
		   Richard Grieco?  How do you know 
		   Steve? 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Look, I just don't want to be 
		   sued. 


   Craig, the best man, begins walking down with the maid of 
   honor. 


					  CRAIG 
				(to maid of honor) 
		   Alright... it's a long walk... 
		   pace yourself. 


  Craig takes pulse, looks at his watch.  Grandma and 
  Grandma Butabi walk down the aisle.  As they approach 
  Craig... 


					  CRAIG 
				(excited) 
		   Grandma, you look unbelievable! 
		   Woo! 


   MR. BUTABI AND STEVE AND BARBARA 


   Walk  down the aisle.  Steve is wearing a CD walkman -- 
   Mr. Butabi notices and yanks it off.  They pass a pretty 
   girl.  Steve veers off course. 


					  STEVE 
				(to girl) 
		   What's up?  You from out of town? 


   Mr. Butabi pulls Steve back on course. 


					  STEVE 
				(turns back to girl) 
		   See you at the reception. 


   EMILY 


   and her parents walk down the aisle... 


					  CRAIG 
		   Steve!  Getting married!  Go for 
		   it!  You are the man! 


					  EMILY 
				(yelling up to Craig) 
		   Shut up, Craig! I'm walking down 
		   the aisle, you dick! 


   Emily goes back to walking gracefully.  MARCH ENDS. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Dearly beloved, we are gathered 
		   here today, to join together... 


					  STEVE 
		   Father?  Did we already start? 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Yes. 


					  STEVE 
		   Oh.  Sorry I thought there was 
		   going to be a buzzer or whistle or 
		   something. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   ... To join together this man and 
		   this woman in holy matrimony.  If 
		   any man can show any just cause 
		   why these two should not be 
		   lawfully joined together, speak 
		   now or forever hold his peace. 


   Nobody speaks.  Beat. 


					  CRAIG (O.S.) 
		   I am having a hell of a time! 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Very good.  Now I understand the 
		   bride and groom have each prepared 
		   something. 


					  EMILY 
				(trying  to rhyme) 
		   Dear Steve, today I wear this 
		   wedding gown, and on my face there 
		   is no frown.  I know our lives 
		   together will be great, just like 
		   when we saw David Copperfield on 
		   our first date.  If you set 
		   something free and it comes back, 
		   you should love it forever, and 
		   like one of your silk plants, I'll 
		   try to stay beautiful, that is my 
		   endeavor.  Love, forever, Emily. 


   Steve steps forward, takes out a piece of paper, reads. 


					  STEVE 
		   Emily, I used to see you outside 
		   my father's store.  And then we 
		   went out on some dates and you let 
		   me have sex with you. 


   Steve steps back.  Priest looks to see if Steve's done. 


					  STEVE 
		   I'm done. 


					  FATHER 
		   Very nice.  Steven, do you promise 
		   to love Emily, comfort her, honor 
		   her, in sickness and in health, as 
		   long as you both shall live? 


					  STEVE 
		   My father already paid the caterer. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Emily, do you promise to comfort 
		   Steve, and honor him in sickness 
		   and health, as long as you both 
		   shall live? 


					  EMILY 
		   I do. 


   Mr. Butabi hands Steve the ring. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now, Steven, repeat after me... 


					  STEVE 
		   'After me'... just kidding.  I'm 
		   nervous. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now repeat after me, with this 
		   ring I thee wed... 


					  STEVE 
		   With this ring, I thee wed. 


   Steve puts the ring on her finger. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Now, Emily, repeat after me.  With 
		   this ring, I thee wed. 


					  EMILY 
		   With This ring -- 


   Suddenly, the ceremony is interrupted by the sound of the 
   GARAGE DOOR OPENING -- revealing... 


   DOUG 


   holding a huge boom box over his head, confidently 
   standing in place.  Emily rolls her eyes.  Mr. Butabi's 
   angry. 


					  STEVE 
				(in shock) 
		   Doug. 


   Doug hits the play button.  "WHAT IS LOVE?" by Haddaway 
   BLASTS. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
				(to organ player) 
		   Let's just keep it going. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
		   Mr. Butabi, I can't -- 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   Just ignore him. 


					  FATHER WILLIAMS 
				(yelling) 
		   Say 'With this ring I thee...' 


					  EMILY 
		   With this ring -- 


   Doug TURNS UP the VOLUME, drowning out Emily. 


   Steve starts bopping his head.  Doug bops his head back. 


					  STEVE 
		   Sorry, Dad. 
				(turns back) 
		   Emily, I'm sorry.  I'm not ready 
		   yet.  I liked your poem. 


   Steve starts walking towards Doug.  Mr. Butabi, furious 
   follows him and reaches to stop him.  Suddenly, a hand 
   pulls him on his back.  We REVEAL it is... 


   CRAIG 


					  CRAIG 
		   I'm sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best 
		   man, my primary duty is to allow 
		   the groom to beat a hasty retreat 
		   should the occasion take a sudden 
		   ugly turn. 


   Butabi tries to get around.  Craig jumps in the way. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Don't test me. 


   Steve runs up to Doug. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hey. 


					  DOUG 
		   Hello. 


   They run out of the back yard. 


   RICHARD GRIECO 


   Puts his arm around Mr. Butabi. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I'm a 
		   keen observer of human nature. 
		   And, I can tell that neither of 
		   your sons are anywhere near the 
		   maturity level necessary for this 
		   sort of commitment. 


   ALTAR 


   Emily is furious.  Craig steps in the groom's spot. 


					  CRAIG 
		   Go ahead, Father. 


					  EMILY 
		   What are you doing? 


					  CRAIG 
		   Emily, with all due respect to 
		   Steve, his discipline is lacking 
		   as is his appreciation for you. 
		   I, on the other hand, can bench 
		   press 305 lbs.  I squat a clean 
		   525, and my body fat percentage is 
		   less than two percent.  Not only 
		   am I a professional trainer, but I 
		   someday hope to market my own 
		   protein bars and produce an Iron 
		   Buns video. 


   Emily considers this a moment, then puts her arm through 
   his. 


					  EMILY 
		   ... Okay... We should look into 
		  infomercials.

   INT. HOLLYWOOD RESERVOIR - DAY 


   Steve and Doug are on the bridge tossing rocks. 


					  DOUG 
		   ... and I also took Craig out

					  STEVE 
		   Mm-hm. 


					  DOUG 
		   That was alright.  Plus, I rented 
		   a lot of videos and I didn't do 
		   much else. 


					  STEVE 
		   Uh-huh. 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, I, uh, I don't know... I 
		   just... Steve? 


   Steve is still looking at the water. 


					  DOUG 
		   Look, I'm sorry.  I said a lot of 
		   bad things before and... lately... 
		   I don't know. 


					  DOUG (CONT'D) 
		   I've been thinking, you know...

		   complete me! 


   Steve walks up to Doug.

   They hug and hold one another as the MUSIC SWELLS...

   EXT. BUTABI BACK YARD - LATER 


   The guests are gone.  In the empty tent, Richard Grieco 
   sits alone drinking wine with Mr. Butabi. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   And it seems to me that you're a 
		   little bit harder on Doug than you 
		   are on Steve.  Isn't that true? 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   You are right.  It's just that 
		   Doug is so rebellious, so hard to 
		   control. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   Rebellious?  Scrappy?  Dreamer, 
		   maybe?  What other young man does 
		   that remind you of? 


   Mr. Butabi has an epiphany. 


					  MR. BUTABI 
		   ... Myself. 


   Richard nods, knowingly. 


					  RICHARD GRIECO 
		   So who are you really fighting 
		   with?

		   Of course you do, bro. 


					  DOUG

				(appreciating Doug's

		   Thanks, bro.  I'm glad you moved

					  DOUG 
		   Dad was kind of a sport about the 
		   wedding once Richard Grieco talked 
		   to him. 


					  STEVE 
		   Yeah, and isn't it a kick in the 
		   head how Emily hooked up with 
		   Craig.

   The Switchboard operator walks up to Doug.

		   Doug? 


   They mentally put the voice with the face and are 
   immediately attracted.

   The female Police Officer who earlier pulled them over is 
   her friend.  Steve steps over. 


					  STEVE 
		   Hottie police officer? 


					  POLICE OFFICER
