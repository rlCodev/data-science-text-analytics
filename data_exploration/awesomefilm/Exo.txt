|                            |early adolescence.                                  |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS CONT)- She shows all the symptoms.    |

|                            |DR. KLEIN- It affects your concentration.           |

|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- It’s a stimulant.                   |

|SAME SCENE CONT.            |DR. KLEIN- The condition isn’t quite what it seems. |
|                            |Nobody knows the cause of hyper-kinetic behavior in |
|                            |a child.  The Ritalin seems to work…                |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS CONT)- to relieve the condition.  As  |
|                            |to how, or why, we really don’t know.               |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (CONT)- But, uh, the symptoms could be    |
|                            |overreaction to depression.  That’s out of my field.|
|1450.15                     |CHRIS- My daughter isn’t depressed.                 |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- Well, you, you mentioned her father, and |
|                            |the separation.                                     |
|                            |CHRIS- Do you think I should take her to a          |
|                            |psychiatrist?                                       |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- No, I think we should wait and see  |
|                            |what happens with the Ritalin.  I think that’s the  |
|                            |answer.                                             |
|                            |CHRIS- Okay.                                        |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Let’s wait two, three weeks.        |
|                            |CHRIS- Alright.  And the lies she’s been telling,   |
|                            |that’s part of it, huh?                             |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Lies?                               |
|                            |CHRIS- Y’know, like saying her bed’s shaking, that  |
|                            |stuff.                                              |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- Have you ever know your daughter to      |
|                            |swear?  To use obscenities?                         |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- No, never.                              |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |DR. KLEIN- Hm, that’s interesting.  Similar, similar|
|                            |to things like her lying.  It’s uncharacteristic for|
|                            |her --                                              |
|                            |CHRIS (OS OVERLAPPING)- I don’t understand, she     |
|                            |doesn’t swear.                                      |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- Well, she let loose quite a string while |
|                            |I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.                  |
|                            |CHRIS- Why, I find that hard to believe.  What’d she|
|                            |say?                                                |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Well, her vocabulary’s rather       |
|                            |extensive.                                          |
|                            |CHRIS- Well, give me an example. What did, like,    |
|                            |like what?  Specifically, what did she say?         |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil,…  |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (CONT)- she advised me to keep my fingers |
|                            |away from her… goddam cunt.                         |
|1567.00                     |CHRIS (OS)- I can’t believe it.                     |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- Well, she’s --                           |
|                            |CHRIS (OS OVERLAPPING)- You, you don’t think a      |

|                            |DR. KLEIN- No, I think the best explanation’s always|
|                            |the simplest.  Well, we’ll wait… we’ll wait and see.|
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- Okay.                                   |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- So, in the meantime, try not to worry.   |
|                            |CHRIS- How?                                         |

|                            |DR. KLEIN- I don’t think so.  I’d like you to see   |

|                            |DR. TANEY- (OS)- How do you do?                     |
|                            |SHARON (OVERLAPPING)- Sharon.  Things have gotten   |
|                            |worse since I phoned you.  I think you better come  |
|                            |upstairs.                                           |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Is she having spasms again?         |
|                            |SHARON- Yeah, but they’ve gotten violent.           |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Did you give her the medication she |
|                            |needed?                                             |
|                            |SHARON- Yes.                                        |
|                            |DR. TANEY- What was that?                           |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- Thorazine.  Before that it was Ritalin.  |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |SHARON (OS)- Chris, doctors.                        |

|                            |REGAN (OS)- Stay away from me!                      |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |REGAN (OS)- No!                                     |
|                            |REGAN (CONT)- No!                                   |
|                            |DR. TANEY (OS)- Hold still.                         |

|                            |CHRIS (OS OVERLAPPING)- No, I want to stay, no!     |
|1355.07                     |DR. KLEIN (OS)- She’s heavily sedated.              |
|int. chris’ house second    |DR. KLEIN (CONT)- She’ll probably sleep through     |
|floor landing. day.         |tomorrow.                                           |
|                            |CHRIS- What was going on in there?  How could she   |
|                            |fly off the bed like that?                          |
|                            |DR. TANEY (OS)- Pathological states can induce      |
|                            |abnormal strength.  Accelerated motor performance.  |
|                            |For example, say a ninety pound woman sees her child|
|                            |pinned under the wheel of a truck.                  |
|                            |DR. TANEY (CONT)- Runs out and lifts the wheel to   |
|                            |half a foot above the ground.  You’ve heard the     |
|                            |story.  Same thing here.                            |
|                            |DR. TANEY (OS CONT)- Same principle, I mean.        |
|                            |CHRIS- So what’s wrong with her?                    |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- We still think the temporal lobe --      |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- Oh,…                                    |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- what are you talking about for Christ |
|                            |sakes?  Did you see her or not?  She’s acting like  |
|                            |she’s fucking out of her mind psychotic, like a,    |
|                            |whaddya, a split personality or… Oh, Jesus --       |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |DR. TANEY- There haven’t been more than a hundred   |
|                            |authentic cases of so-called split personality, Mrs.|
|                            |MacNeil.  Now, I know the temptation to leap to     |
|                            |psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would   |
|                            |exhaust the somatic possibilities first.            |
|                            |CHRIS- What’s next?                                 |
|                            |DR. TANEY- Pneumoencephalogram, I would think.  Pin |
|                            |down that lesion.                                   |
|                            |DR. TANEY (OS CONT)- It will involve another spinal.|
|                            |CHRIS- Oh, Christ!                                  |
|                            |DR. TANEY- Now, what we missed in the EEG and the   |
|                            |arteriograms, could conceivably turn up there.      |
|                            |DR. TANEY (OS CONT)- At least it would eliminate    |
|                            |certain other possibilities.                        |

|                            |CHRIS- No.  Of course not.  Nothing like that.      |
|                            |DR. KLEIN (OS)- Are you sure?                       |

|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- no, I, uh, I’m building a new house.  |
|                            |My old one’s been sold.  I don’t know.  I was gonna |

|                            |after she finished school.  Why’d you ask?          |
|                            |DR. KLEIN- I think it’s time we started looking for |
|                            |a psychiatrist.                                     |

|                            |SHARON (OVERLAPPING)- Wide open?  Didn’t he tell    |
|                            |you?                                                |
|                            |CHRIS- Didn’t who tell me?                          |
|                            |SHARON- Burke.  He’s --                             |
|                            |CHRIS (INTERRUPTING)- What’s Burke got to do with   |

|                            |SHARON- Look, there wasn’t anybody here, so when I  |
|                            |went to get the Thorazine, I had him stay with her  |
|                            |and --                                              |
|                            |CHRIS- Oh.                                          |
|                            |SHARON- I should’ve known better.  I’m sorry.       |
|                            |CHRIS- I guess you should’ve.                       |
|                            |SHARON (OS)- How were the tests?                    |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- We have to start looking…               |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- for a shrink.  Hi, Chuck.  C’mon in.  |
|                            |CHUCK- I suppose you heard.                         |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- Heard what?                             |
|                            |CHUCK- You haven’t heard.  Burke’s dead.            |
|                            |CHUCK (OS CONT)- He must’ve been drunk.  He fell    |
|                            |down from the top of the steps right outside.  By   |
|                            |the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck.        |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |CHRIS (OS)- Oh, God.                                |

|                            |John Garfield.  People tell you that, Father?       |
|                            |KARRAS- Do people tell you you look like Paul       |

|                            |subject of witchcraft?  From the witching end, not  |

|                            |KARRAS- I once did a paper on it.                   |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Really.                              |
|                            |KARRAS- From the psychiatric end.                   |

|                            |desecration in the church, you think this has       |
|                            |anything to do with witchcraft?                     |
|                            |KARRAS- Maybe.  Some rituals used in the black mass,|
|                            |maybe.                                              |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- And now, Dennings, you, you read how |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- And, please, Father,…      |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (CONT)- confidential.  Burke Dennings,|
|                            |good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps |
|                            |leading to M Street with his head turned completely…|
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- around.  Facing backwards. |
|                            |KARRAS- Didn’t happen in the fall?                  |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- It’s possible.                       |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- Possible.  However, --     |
|                            |KARRAS- Unlikely.                                   |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Exactly.  So on the one hand we’ve   |
|                            |got a witchcraft kinda murder, and on the other a   |
|                            |black mass type desecration in the church --        |
|                            |KARRAS- You think the killer and the desecrator are |
|                            |the same.                                           |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Maybe somebody crazy.  Somebody with |
|                            |a spite against the church, some unconscious        |
|                            |rebellion.                                          |

|SAME SCENE CONT.            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- You know who was sick at   |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (CONT)- I mean, this kind of sickness,|
|                            |you’d know that.                                    |
|                            |KARRAS (OS)- I don’t know anyone …                  |
|                            |KARRAS (CONT)- who fits that description.           |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Ah!  Doctor’s ethics --- if you knew,|
|                            |you wouldn’t tell, huh?                             |
|                            |KARRAS- No, I probably wouldn’t.                    |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Not to bother you with trivia, but a |

|                            |was put in jail for not telling police what he knew |

|                            |KARRAS- Is that a threat?                           |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- No, I mention it only in passing.    |
|                            |KARRAS- Incidentally, I mention it only in passing –|
|                            |I could always tell the judge it was a matter of    |
|                            |confession.                                         |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Hey, hey!  Father, wait a minute.    |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Well, I get passes to the best shows |
|                            |in town.  Mrs. K though, y’know, she gets tired,    |
|                            |y’know, never likes to go.                          |
|                            |KARRAS- That’s too bad.                             |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |LT. KINDERMAN (OVERLAPPING)- Yeah.  I hate to go    |
|                            |alone.  Y’know, I love to… talk film, y’know.       |
|                            |Discuss, to critique.  You want to see a film with  |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS)- Who’s in it?                    |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (CONT)- Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona,   |
|                            |and Othello Groucho Marx.  You happy?               |
|                            |KARRAS- I’ve seen it.                               |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Ah.                                  |

|                            |really did it?                                      |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- You look like…             |

|                            |CLINIC DIRECTOR- Of course there is one outside     |
|                            |chance for a cure.  Uh, I think of it as a… shock   |
|                            |treatment.  As I said it’s a…                       |
|                            |CLINIC DIRECTOR (OS CONT)- very outside chance, but |

|SAME SCENE CONT.            |CLINIC DOCTOR- Do you have any religious beliefs?   |

|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- Why?                                  |
|                            |CLINIC DIRECTOR- Have you ever heard of exorcism?   |
|                            |Well, it’s a stylized ritual in which the Rabbi or  |
|                            |the Priest try to drive out this so-called invading |
|                            |spirit, uh.  It’s been pretty much discarded these  |
|                            |days, except by the Catholics, who keep it in the   |
|                            |closet as a sort of an embarrassment, but, uh…      |
|                            |CLINIC DIRECTOR (OS CONT)- it, uh, has worked.  In  |
|                            |fact, although not for the reasons they think.  Of  |
|                            |course,…                                            |
|                            |CLINIC DIRECTOR (CONT)- it, it’s, uh, purely a force|
|                            |of suggestion.  The, uh, the victim’s belief in     |
|                            |possession is what helped cause it, so in that same |
|                            |way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it |
|                            |disappear.                                          |
|                            |CHRIS- You’re telling me that I should take my      |
|                            |daughter to a witchdoctor.  Is that it?             |

|                            |CHRIS- What?                                        |
|                            |KARL- A man to see you.                             |

|1504.00                     |LT. KINDERMAN (OS)- Might your daughter remember,   |

|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Ah, might she remember?              |
|                            |CHRIS- No.  She was heavily sedated.                |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- It’s serious?                        |
|                            |CHRIS- Yes, I’m afraid it is.                       |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- May I ask --                         |
|                            |CHRIS (INTERRUPTING)- We still don’t know.          |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN- Watch out for drafts.  A draft in the|
|                            |fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for    |
|                            |bacteria.                                           |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |KARL- Excuse me, madam.  Anything else?             |

|                            |alright, Karl.                                      |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- Why are you asking all this?          |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS)- It’s strange.                   |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (CONT)- The deceased comes to visit,  |
|                            |stays only twenty minutes – and leaves all alone a  |
|                            |very sick girl?  And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil,|
|                            |it isn’t likely he would fall from a window.        |
|                            |Besides, a fall wouldn’t do to his neck what we     |
|                            |found – except maybe one chance in a thousand.  No, |
|                            |my hunch… my opinion… he was killed by a very       |
|                            |powerful man – point one.                           |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (OS CONT)- And the fracturing of his  |
|                            |skull, point two, plus the various other things we  |
|                            |mentioned,…                                         |
|                            |LT. KINDERMAN (CONT)- would make it very probable – |
|                            |probable, not certain – that the deceased was killed|
|                            |and then pushed from your daughter’s window.  But   |
|                            |nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how |
|                            |can this be?  It could be one way: If someone came  |
|                            |calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the  |
|                            |time you returned.                                  |

|1694.07                     |CHRIS- Not at all.                                  |

|                            |KARRAS- It’s the other way around.  The Society sent|
|                            |me through medical school.                          |

|                            |CHRIS- About my daughter.                           |
|                            |KARRAS (OS)- No, I didn’t know you had one.         |
|                            |CHRIS- He didn’t mention her?                       |
|                            |KARRAS- No.                                         |
|                            |CHRIS- Oh.  Didn’t tell you what she did?           |
|                            |KARRAS- He didn’t mention her.                      |
|                            |CHRIS- Priests are pretty tight mouthed, then, huh? |
|                            |KARRAS- That depends.                               |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |CHRIS- On what?                                     |

|                            |CHRIS- Sure.  I mean,…                              |
|                            |CHRIS (OS CONT)- what if a person,…                 |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- uh, came to,…                         |
|                            |CHRIS (OS CONT)- y’know, there was a murderer or a  |
|                            |criminal of some…                                   |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- kind and they, and they wanted some   |
|                            |kind of help.  I mean, would you have to turn ‘em   |
|                            |in?                                                 |
|                            |KARRAS- Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,|
|                            |I’d say no.                                         |
|                            |CHRIS- You wouldn’t --                              |
|                            |KARRAS- No, I wouldn’t.  But I would try to convince|
|                            |him to turn himself in.                             |
|                            |CHRIS- Uh huh.  And, uh, how do you go about getting|
|                            |an exorcism?                                        |
|                            |KARRAS- I beg your pardon?                          |
|374.13                      |CHRIS- If, um, if a person – y’know, possessed by a |
|                            |demon or something.  How do they, how do they get an|
|                            |exorcism?                                           |
|                            |KARRAS- Well, the first thing, I’d have to get ‘em  |
|                            |into a time machine, get ‘em back to the 16th       |
|                            |Century.                                            |
|                            |CHRIS- I didn’t get ya?                             |
|                            |KARRAS- Well, it just doesn’t happen anymore, Mrs.  |
|                            |MacNeil.                                            |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |CHRIS- Oh yeah?  Since when?                        |
|                            |KARRAS- Well, since we learned about mental illness,|
|                            |paranoia, schizophrenia.  All those things they     |
|                            |taught me at Harvard.  Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I|
|                            |joined the Jesuits, I’ve never met one priest who   |
|                            |has performed an exorcism.  Not one.                |
|                            |CHRIS- Yeah, well, … um, it just so happens that    |
|                            |somebody very close to me is,… is probably          |
|                            |possessed,…                                         |
|                            |CHRIS (OS CONT)- and needs an exorcism.             |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- Father Karras, it’s my little girl.   |
|                            |KARRAS- Then that’s all the more reason to forget   |
|                            |about exorcism.                                     |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- Why?  I don’t understand                |
|                            |KARRAS- To begin with, it could make things worse.  |
|                            |CHRIS- Oh, how?                                     |
|466.14                      |KARRAS- Secondly, the Church, before it approves an |
|                            |exorcism, conducts an investigation to see if it’s  |
|                            |warranted.  That takes time.  Meanwhile, your       |
|                            |daughter --                                         |
|                            |CHRIS (OVERLAPPING)- Yeah, but, but you could do it |
|                            |yourself, couldn’t you?                             |
|                            |KARRAS (OVERLAPPING)- No, I couldn’t.  I need church|
|                            |approval and that’s rarely given.                   |
|                            |CHRIS- But, ah…Could you see her?                   |
|                            |                                                    |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |KARRAS- Yes, I could.  I could see her as a         |
|                            |psychiatrist, but I can’t see her --                |
|                            |CHRIS (OVERLAPPING)- Oh, not a psychiatrist, she    |
|                            |needs a priest.  She’s already seen every fucking   |
|                            |psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you.  |
|                            |Now you gonna send me back to them?  Jesus Christ,  |
|                            |won’t somebody…                                     |
|                            |CHRIS (OS CONT)- help me.                           |
|                            |KARRAS (OVERLAPPING)- Now, you don’t see, you don’t |
|                            |understand.  Your daughter --                       |
|                            |CHRIS (OS OVERLAPPING)- Oh, God,…                   |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- can’t you help her?  Just help her?   |

|584.00                      |KARRAS (OS)- Hello, Regan.                          |
|int. regan’s bedroom. day.  |KARRAS (CONT)- I’m a friend of your mother’s.  I’d  |
|                            |like to help you.                                   |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON- You might loosen the straps, then.    |
|                            |KARRAS- I’m afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.  |
|                            |REGAN AS CHRIS- I’m not Regan.                      |
|                            |KARRAS (OS)- I see.  Well, then, let’s introduce    |
|                            |ourselves.  I’m Damien Karras.                      |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON- And I’m the devil.  Now kindly undue  |
|                            |these straps.                                       |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |KARRAS- If you’re the devil, why not make the straps|
|                            |disappear?                                          |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON- That’s much too vulgar a display of   |
|                            |power, Karras.                                      |
|                            |KARRAS- Where’s Regan?                              |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON- In here, with us.                     |
|                            |KARRAS- Show me Regan and I’ll loosen one of the    |
|                            |straps.                                             |
|                            |DERELICT’S VOICE (OS)- Can you help an old altar    |
|                            |boy, Father?                                        |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON (OS)- Your mother’s…                   |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON (CONT)- in here with us, Karras.  Would|
|                            |you like to leave a message?                        |
|                            |REGAN/ DEMON (OS CONT)- I’ll see that she gets it.  |
|                            |KARRAS- If that’s true, then you must know my       |
|                            |mother’s maiden name.  What is it?                  |
|                            |KARRAS- What is it?                                 |
|790.00                      |KARRAS (OS)- Thank you.  Look, I’m only against the |
|int. basement CHRIS’ house. |possibility of doing your daughter more harm than   |
|day.                        |good.                                               |
|                            |CHRIS- Nothing you could do could make it any worse.|
|                            |KARRAS (OS)- I can’t do it.  I need evidence that   |
|                            |the Church would accept as signs of possession.     |
|                            |CHRIS- Like what?                                   |
|                            |                                                    |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |KARRAS- Like her speaking in a language she’s never |
|                            |known or studied.                                   |
|                            |CHRIS (OS)- What else?                              |
|                            |KARRAS- I don’t know.  I’d have to…                 |
|                            |KARRAS (OS CONT)- look it up.                       |
|                            |CHRIS- I thought you were supposed to be an expert. |
|                            |KARRAS- There are no experts.  You probably know as |
|                            |much about possession as most priests.  Look, your  |
|                            |daughter doesn’t say she’s a demon, she says she’s  |
|                            |the devil himself.  Now, if you‘ve seen as many     |
|                            |psychotics as I have you’d realized that’s the same |
|                            |thing as saying you’re Napoleon Bonaparte.  You     |
|                            |asked me what I think is best for your daughter.    |
|                            |Six months under observation in the best hospital   |
|                            |you can find.                                       |
|                            |CHRIS- You show me Regan’s double – same face, same |
|                            |voice, everything – and I’d know it wasn’t Regan.   |
|                            |I’d know in my gut. I’m telling you that that thing |
|                            |upstairs isn’t my daughter.  And I want you to tell |
|                            |me that you know for a fact that there’s nothing    |
|                            |wrong with my daughter except in her mind.          |
|                            |CHRIS (OS CONT)- You tell me you know for a fact    |
|                            |that an exorcism wouldn’t do any good.              |
|                            |CHRIS (CONT)- You tell me that!                     |
|936.00                      |KARRAS (OS)- Did Regan know a priest was coming     |
|ext. CHRIS’ house. night.   |over?                                               |
|                            |CHRIS- No.                                          |
|                            |KARRAS- Did you know my mother died recently?       |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |CHRIS (OS)- Yes, I did.  I’m very sorry.            |
|                            |KARRAS- No – Is Regan aware of it?                  |
|                            |CHRIS- Not at all.  Why’d you ask?                  |
|                            |KARRAS (OS)- It’s not important.                    |
|                            |KARRAS (CONT)- Good night.                          |

|                            |But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the|
|                            |conditions set down in the ritual.                  |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- You would want to do the exorcism   |

|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- It might be best to have a man of   |
|                            |experience, maybe someone who spent time…           |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL (OS CONT)- in foreign missions.      |
|                            |KARRAS- I understand, Your Excellency.              |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL (OS)- Let’s see who’s around.        |

|74.13                       |TOM- Well, he does know the background.  I doubt    |
|int. conference room. day.  |there’s any danger in just having him assist.       |
|                            |Should be a psychiatrist…                           |
|                            |TOM (OS CONT)- present, anyway.                     |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- What about the exorcist.  Have you  |
|                            |any ideas?                                          |
|                            |TOM- How about Lancaster Merrin?                    |
|SAME SCENE CONT.            |BISHOP MICHAEL- Merrin?  Well, I had notion he was  |
|                            |over in Iraq.  I think I read that he was working on|
|                            |a dig near Nineveh.                                 |
|                            |TOM- Yeah, you’re right, Mike, but he’s finished.   |
|                            |Came back three or four months ago.  He’s at        |
|                            |Woodstock now.                                      |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- What’s he doing there?  Teaching?   |
|                            |TOM- No, he’s working on another book.              |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- Don’t you think he’s too old, Tom?  |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL (OS CONT)- How’s his health?         |
|                            |TOM- It must be alright.  He’s still running around |
|                            |digging up tombs.                                   |
|                            |TOM (OS CONT)- Besides, he’s had experience.        |
|                            |BISHOP MICHAEL- I didn’t know that.                 |
|                            |TOM (OS)- Ten,…                                     |
|                            |TOM (CONT)- twelve years ago, I think, in Africa.   |
