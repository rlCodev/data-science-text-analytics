EXT. ESTABLISHING - BURNFIELD - DAY

Over the various images of Burnfield's strip malls and fast food 
joints we hear GENE PITNEY singing.

GENE PITNEY (V.O.)
(singing)
"When your young and so in love as we 
and bewildered by the world we see
why do people hurt us so
Only those in love know
What a town without pity can do
If we stop to gave upon a star
people talk about how bad we are
ours is not an easy age
we're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do"


INT. JEFF'S ROOM - GARAGE - DAY

JEFF is talking on the telephone inside of his tent which is has 
set up in his parents garage. 

JEFF
(into telephone)
Buff? Yeah, I'll see you down there later. I just gotta finish 
some stuff I'm writing. Okay. 'Bye. 

Jeff clicks over to the other line.

JEFF
(into telephone)
SOOZE? Yeah, so did you tell him that we couldn't afford twenty 
bucks a ticket and why didn't he put us on the comp list? No, no, 
there's always a comp list. Alright. Well, so then, just get your 
mother's car and maybe we'll all go do something. Yeah. I gotta 
get off. Okay. 'Bye.

CUT TO:


INT. PIZZA JOINT - DAY

BUFF is the one of the only people working. Pies are over cooking 
in the oven and Buff is trying to punch out of work as soon as he 
can.

BUFF
(into telephone)
Hey, Frankie! Hey, what are you doing? Sleeping? What, at six 
o'clock? Sleep when you are dead. Hey, man, I just got off work. 
Why don't you meet me down at the corner. So? Put on some clothes 
and come down, man, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I wanna see you, man. 
Alright. Yeah. Hey, why don't you bring that pot you just bought? 
What?! Yeah, fuck you man!
(to employee)
Later.

CUT TO:


INT. SOOZE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY
	
Sooze's room is covered with a wide variety of artwork, most of 
which she as done. She hangs up the phone and walks down the 
hallway towards her MOTHERS room. She stops in her mother's 
doorway,

SOOZE
I'm going out later.

SOOZE'S MOM
No car.

SOOZE
The fuck not?

SOOZE'S MOM
You know the fuck not.

SOOZE
Fuck.

SOOZE'S MOM
Don't swear it's impolite.

Sooze storms out of the room and back down the hall to her own 
room. Sooze's mom is watching a shopping channel on the 
television. We dolly into the television.

SHOPPING CHANNEL HOST
... suggest that you call immediately. We are truly thrilled to 
bring you this next item and it's a Host Value Special. It's the 
spiral relaxation lamp. I personally bought one of these for a 
very good friend of mine and ended up falling in love with it, I 
found myself mesmerized by watching the balls. That's why I 
suggest that if you're going to buy one, that you buy maybe two 
or three...

CUT TO:


INT. CIRCLE A CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

Two POLICE OFFICERS (CHIP and GARY) are at the counter buying 
cigarettes. Jeff is also inside shopping. The convenience store 
worker, NAZEER, is watching a cops-like TV show.

TV REPORTER (V.O.)
It started with a traffic argument, escalated to the firing of a 
legally carried handgun, ending with the death of the man it was 
aimed at. GORDON RIEDHALE claimed he couldn't escape an attacker 
who was punching him in the head. Concealed carry instructors 
say, "It's that fear..."

CHIP
Just depends on the filter capacity. What size is that pool?

GARY
Fifty-five thousand. 
(to Nazeer)
Marlboros, chief. Hard pack.

CHIP
In that case you need a heavy-duty filter.

NAZEER
Two-fifty.

GARY
Two-fifty? They go up?

NAZEER
Always two-fifty, my friend.

TV REPORTER (V.O.)
What that means is that every armed licensee faced with danger 
must make a split second judgment call.

Gary places two-fifty on the counter and him and Chip walk back 
to their patrol car. As they leave the parking lot they see TIM 
sitting on the side of the building.

CHIP
(to Tim)
Timmy-boy!

Tim makes a "smooth sailing" gesture with his hand. Buff roles 
over to Tim on his roller blades. He sweeps off a piece of 
concrete and places down a slice of pizza. Buff begins to play 
hockey with two empty beer cans on the ground. He shoots one at 
the dumpster and the other at Tim.

BUFF
Peace! Ah, time's running out, three, two, one!

He shoots the beer can at Tim, barely missing him. Jeff walks up 
from around the corner holding a package of cookies he just 
bought. Nazeer is right behind him eating something.

BUFF (CONT'D)
Score! Yeah!

NAZEER
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.

Jeff turns around.

JEFF
What?

NAZEER
Seven-twenty.

JEFF
I gave it to you.

BUFF
He paid you man.

NAZEER
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.

BUFF
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.

Jeff digs into his pockets.

JEFF
Here's twenty-five cents.

Nazeer takes the money and walks away.

JEFF (CONT'D)
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.

BUFF
Needs some pizza in his diet.

Buff is eating his slice of pizza and skating around the group.

TIM
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know 
what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your 
fucking legs. Take 'em off.

BUFF
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.

He sits down and begins to take of his blades.

TIM
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack 
that guy with a baseball bat.

JEFF
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it 
easy.

TIM
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been 
there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can 
over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, 
you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, 
they think it's gonna be the same.

JEFF
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.

TIM
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way 
ticket back to Greaseball-land.

JEFF
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or 
India or wherever the fuck he comes from.

BUFF
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? 
Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. 
Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.

JEFF
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for 
some half-dead Bangladeshi.

BUFF
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.

JEFF
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when 
Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me 
upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be 
pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the 
first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from 
now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing 
here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the 
price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And 
then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones 
and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure 
out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be 
full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.

TIM
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking 
upset about, fuckhead?

JEFF
Because I'm alienated.

BUFF
Hey! Hey, you like orgasms? Oh, yeah!
(yells)
Oh, Hey, hey, I'm at work yesterday, bitch comes in, orders a 
twelve-inch pie with extra cheese. So I ask her if she wanted me, 
like, to carry that out to her car for her. Bitch is obviously in 
heat. "Yes, right away." So I carry the pie out to her car. We 
smoke a J. She blows me. We eat the pizza, I chase her with the 
beer. Smoke, babe, slice, brew. All four bases, fuckin' home run 
man!

Jeff walks over towards the payphone, Buff follows. He dials a 
number.

JEFF
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to 
lie.

BUFF
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a 
concert where I had fucked two girls.

JEFF
(into telephone)
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.

BUFF
And your mom.

JEFF
(into telephone)
No, I'm here. Where are you?

BUFF
Where are you-hoo?

JEFF
(into telephone)
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the 
tickets.

BUFF
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?

JEFF
Shut up! Aw...

Nazeer opens the front doors of the Circle A and shouts at Buff 
and Jeff.

NAZEER
Look, you can't be out here all night tonight, okay?

Tim comes out from around the corner. Jeff continues talking on 
the phone ignoring the argument.

BUFF
Hey, we're just having a conversation.

NAZEER
This is private property, my friend.

TIM
Come on man.

BUFF
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my 
friend.

NAZEER
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.

BUFF
We're your customers. We're not complaining.

NAZEER
Please!

Nazeer walks back into the store. Buff and Tim walk back around 
the corner towards the dumpster. Jeff is sitting by himself. Buff 
goes to sit down next to him.

JEFF
You don't need to sit next to me right now.

TIM
Who were you talking to?

JEFF
Nobody. Sooze.

BUFF
Stuck with what guy?

JEFF
What?

BUFF
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?

JEFF
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's 
brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.

BUFF
It's your birthday?

JEFF
Yeah.

BUFF 
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!

Tim and Buff grab Jeff and form a line, simulating sex. BEE-BEE 
approaches.

BUFF AND TIM
Happy birthday! Happy fuckin' birthday!

BEE-BEE
Um, is Sooze around?

JEFF
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.

BEE-BEE
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?

JEFF
I don't know.

BUFF
Want a beer? 
(to Jeff)
Is Pony coming?

BEE-BEE
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did 
she talk to him?

TIM
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk 
music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?

BUFF
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for 
"Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man. 
(to Jeff)
Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

BEE-BEE
(to Tim)
Didn't you see their video on MTV?

TIM
No, I shot my TV.

BUFF
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?

JEFF
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him 
to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and 
Sooze are gonna...

TIM
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, 
the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?

JEFF
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...

BEE-BEE
We are?

JEFF
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

BUFF
(excited)
Pony's coming here to the corner?!

JEFF
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.

TIM
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, 
that's fine with us.

JEFF
Sooze wants to see him.

TIM
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's 
like to be on MTV.

BUFF
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?

BEE-BEE
Yeah, when's he coming?

JEFF
I don't know. Later. I don't know.

BUFF
(yells)
Yes!

FADE OUT

FADE IN:


EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - LATER - NIGHT

Jeff and Sooze are kissing.

JEFF
God, I haven't seen you all day.

SOOZE
You could've come over.

JEFF
I know, I know, I know.

Jeff pulls out the front of Sooze's pants and looks inside them.

JEFF (CONT'D)
Oh! Trim it!

SOOZE
I hate that.

JEFF
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.

SOOZE
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing 
my performance right now.

JEFF
Okay, so maybe later.

CUT TO:


EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Everyone is sitting around watching Sooze do her performance art 
piece. She dances and jigs along with the words to her piece.

SOOZE
Ow. Jesus. Fuck Oliver Stone. Fuck Bill Clinton. Fuck Howard 
Stern. Fuck Michael Bolton. Fuck O.J. Simpson. Fuck Pope John 
Paul. Fuck my dad. Fuck all the men. Fuck all the men. Fuck all 
the men!

She begins to dance a jig.

SOOZE (CONT'D)
Bang your head, blow your nose.
Run down the street, suck a hose.
Chew my lips, eat some shit.
Eat a stick of dynamite and blow yourself to bits.
Shut your mouth, go away.
Drink my piss, have a nice day!
I hope you cry and never doubt.
I hope you die with blood in your mouth.
I hope your lies will no more shout
What's in my eyes, what's in your snout.
Your a pig! I know that's true!
I dance a jig! Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Sooze ends her piece and looks at everyone.

SOOZE
So?

Everyone slowly starts to applaud.

BEE-BEE
That was really great.

SOOZE
Was it okay?

BEE-BEE
Yeah!

SOOZE
What did you guys think?

BEE-BEE
Slides go with it.

SOOZE
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and 
paintings and stuff.

JEFF
Was that supposed to be me?

SOOZE
No.

JEFF
Yes.

BEE-BEE
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical 
Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?

SOOZE
Why is everything about you, Jeff?

JEFF
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.

SOOZE
Man?

JEFF
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.

SOOZE
It's a piece.

JEFF
Your sure as hell right about that.

SOOZE
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application 
to the School of Visual Arts in New York.

BUFF
Ah, you know people there?

SOOZE
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to 
death.

JEFF
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.

SOOZE
I don't want to hear it anymore.

JEFF
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're 
jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who 
teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he 
wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you 
have talent. 

SOOZE
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed 
in Art Forum. I think he knows.

JEFF
(in mock British accent)
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.

SOOZE
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out 
thumbs up our asses and twirl.

TIM
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New 
York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of 
view.

SOOZE
At least I have a point of view, you know?

BEE-BEE
Uh-huh.

SOOZE
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.

JEFF
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.

SOOZE
So you can give me more shit?

JEFF
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to 
communicate?

SOOZE
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise 
consciousness. Make people think for a change.

BEE-BEE
Mn-hm.

JEFF
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?

SOOZE
Yes, you asshole.

JEFF
About what?

SOOZE
About things that are important to me.

JEFF
Like what?

SOOZE
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military 
industrial...

BEE-BEE
Um-hm.

JEFF
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

SOOZE
Of course I do!

JEFF
Name one.

SOOZE
God, KAREN JOHNSON.

JEFF
One!

SOOZE
Your completely missing the point.

JEFF
Hey!

SOOZE
I'm talking about idealism.

BEE-BEE
Responsibility, progress.

SOOZE
Yes.

JEFF
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.

SOOZE
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.

JEFF
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.

SOOZE
But do you stand for anything?

JEFF
Yes, I stand for -

SOOZE
What? What do you stand for?
 
JEFF
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!

SOOZE
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.

JEFF
Can I talk here? Let me talk.

SOOZE
You know, all you know is what's good for you.

JEFF
Can I talk?

SOOZE
Typical male.

BEE-BEE
Typical male.

SOOZE
Typical male.

BEE-BEE
Typical male.

SOOZE
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously? 

TIM
Seriously? It's a great idea.

SOOZE
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.

TIM
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my 
country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm 
back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.

The group starts to head back up to the Circle A.

SOOZE
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation 
with a human being?

JEFF
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?

SOOZE
Um, because you didn't want to go.

JEFF
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some 
band that I helped start.

SOOZE
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.

TIM, BUFF, & JEFF
(in unison)
He's a geek.

BUFF
Hey, I've been, uh, making these tapes, videotapes. I ripped off 
a camcorder up at the mall. I thought, you know, it could be 
something that I do, be a video artist, you know.

TIM
Ladies and gentlemen, Buff, the postmodern idiot savant. He will 
outdo us all.

As the group walks up the front walk of the Circle A, Buff spots 
Nazzer sweeping up the walk. Buff harges at him, twisting and 
turning his hockey stick in mock kung-fu fashion. He stops right 
in front of Nazeer.

BUFF
(in mock kung-fu scream)
It's safe, come on.

NAZEER
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.

JEFF
Why we're just standing here.

NAZEER
Look, your trespassing.

BUFF
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my 
cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over 
mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about 
how you sell beer to minors.

NAZEER
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, 
let's go!

SOOZE
We're just standing here!

NAZEER
Just go and stand someplace else, okay?

BUFF
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is 
our corner. You don't fucking own it!

NAZEER
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.

BUFF
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.

TIM
Why don't you go back to where you came from?

SOOZE
Hey, Tim.

TIM
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 
'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow 
words, man: roll on.

NAZEER
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what are you, huh? You fucking drunk bum. 
Yeah, you good-for-nothing. You just, uh, hang around. On my 
property.

TIME
The Hare Krishna's calling me a drunk. Hey, listen, pal, you want 
us to go?

NAZEER
Yeah, please, go. Come on.

TIM
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.

SOOZE
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.

TIM
Fucking drunk, huh?

SOOZE
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?

JEFF
Don't let 'em fight.

BUFF
The dude wants it.

SOOZE
This is ridiculous!

JEFF
Tim!

PAKEESA, Nazeer's wife comes out of the store brandishing a gun.

NAZEER
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just 
joking around.

BUFF
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take 
a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!

SOOZE
We're sorry, okay? We're gonna go.

The group begins to walk away.
 
TIM
Hey, your gonna regret this.

SOOZE
Come on, Jeff.

BUFF
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.

SOOZE
(from across the parking lot)
Jeff! Let's go!

Jeff is looking at Nazeer.

JEFF
Hey, I'm sorry about that. It was just a misunderstanding. He was 
upset about something and he took it out on you and I'm sorry. 
'Bye.

Jeff walks away quickly to catch up with the group.


EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - NIGHT

The group is walking down the street. Sooze and Bee-Bee are in 
front, a few feet away is Tim who walks by himself, and holding 
up the rear are Jeff and Buff.

JEFF
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.

BUFF
That's the rock star thing.

JEFF
No, no.

BUFF
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x 
video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!

JEFF
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.

BUFF
Sorry.

JEFF
Jesus Christ.

BUFF
You wanna bet he's with a girl?

JEFF
No, he's not with a girl.

BUFF
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!

JEFF
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.

BUFF
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?

JEFF
I'd get bored.

BUFF
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up 
singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty 
breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, 
six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my 
babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather 
Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew 
off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd 
have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced 
nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then 
she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo 
lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an 
hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching 
Gilligan.

JEFF
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in 
the afternoon?

BUFF
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all 
the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger 
or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead 
of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.

JEFF
That sounds so depressing.

BUFF
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!

JEFF
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.

BUFF
Ah!

JEFF
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.

BUFF
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.

JEFF
Watch out for that tree.

Buff misses the tree.

BUFF
A long, long, long, long, while.

JEFF
Okay, okay.

BUFF
A long, long, long...

JEFF
Okay.

Up ahead the group is taking two different paths. Sooze and Bee-
Bee are headed towards a burger joint, while Tim is headed the 
opposite way towards the liquor store. 

BUFF
Hey, Tim! Hold up.

Buff takes off after Tim.

CUT TO:


INT. BURGER JOINT - BOOTH - NIGHT

Jeff, Sooze, and Bee-Bee are all sitting at a booth with plates 
of food in front of them. They are in mid-conversation when we 
join them.

SOOZE
It was a racial incident.

JEFF
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?

SOOZE
It got that close.

JEFF
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something 
really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.

SOOZE
Oh, yeah?

JEFF
Yeah.

SOOZE
Okay, what would you have done.

JEFF
I would've stopped it.

SOOZE
How?

JEFF
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of 
hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe 
we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all 
these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...

SOOZE
Jeff. Jeff.

JEFF
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.

SOOZE
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has 
this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for 
six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.

JEFF
Sooze.

Bee-Bee walks away from the conversation, getting her own booth.

SOOZE
What?

JEFF
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about 
you moving to New York?

SOOZE
What feelings?

JEFF
Us.

SOOZE
Of course.

JEFF
And?

SOOZE
Come with me.

JEFF
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York 
if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order 
a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can 
see, see homeless people up close and personal?

SOOZE
So what do you wanna do?

JEFF
Nothing.

SOOZE
No one does nothing, Jeff.

JEFF
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.

SOOZE
New ground?

JEFF
Mm-hm.

SOOZE
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, 
while barely holding a job packing boxes?

JEFF
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? 
What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the 
cover of some glossy magazine?

SOOZE
My goal is to make art.

JEFF
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why 
is somewhere else better?

SOOZE
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and 
watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?

JEFF
Mm-mm.

SOOZE
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like 
to be a real artist?

JEFF
No, no.

SOOZE
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at 
the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?

JEFF
I don't know.

Hey. Do you have a cigarette?

BUFF
No I quit.

BEE-BEE
Hey, you said you did a video?

BUFF
Yup.

What's it about?

BUFF
It's really not about anything.

BEE-BEE
Oh. Well, what's it on?

BUFF
A cloud.

BEE-BEE
A cloud?

BUFF
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.

hospital or something?

BEE-BEE
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.

BUFF
Your a nurse?

Any gunshot victims?

Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, 
most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. 
Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.

Nazeer. He quickly ducks back around the corner, laughing.

Shit.

A long, black, stretched, limo pulls up. Pony gets out.

Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?

JEFF
Good, man.

Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that 
your limo?

PONY
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you 
know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...

JEFF
No, it's not...

PONY
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?

Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

PONY
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like 
that, you know.

Yeah.

PONY
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says 
that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.

Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like 
living the wild life now, huh?

that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing 
The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, 
uh, the prom.

You guys missed it.

JEFF
Sorry.

PONY
So how's college?

JEFF
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, 
a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying 
to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some 
writing, though. Short pieces, you know.

ERICA
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.

PONY
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.

JEFF
You know, I've thought about that, actually.

PONY
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things 
you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.

ERICA
Mm.

PONY
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front 
of the whole class.

ERICA
I'd love to read that.

PONY
Funny shit, man.

JEFF
So you think I should?

PONY
What?

JEFF
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.

PONY
Like songs?

Yeah, they could be songs.

PONY
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.

Yeah, really.

PONY
Look at you!

SOOZE
Oh!

PONY
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good

PONY
Well, not exactly.

JEFF
For a while.

PONY
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you 
play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you 
know, before Danny signed us.

ERICA
Right.

JEFF
Yeah, well, I, I came by more than a couple times.

Tim walks over to the group.

TIM
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here 
we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of 
like one of those documentaries on educational TV?

ERICA
It's nice here. It's different.

TIM
Yeah, totally. 
(to Pony)
So, uh, what do they interview you about?

PONY
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, 
uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, 
you know, stuff like that.

TIM
Where do you get your ideas?

SOOZE
Leave him alone, Tim.

TIM
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.

animals.

SOOZE

BUFF
Your his publicist?

ERICA
Sure I am. It's fun.

BUFF
Mm. And your like, what else?

Bee-Bee watches Buff flirt with Erica. He face grows a long 
scorn.

ERICA
What do you mean? His girlfriend?

BUFF
Well, that's one way of putting it.

ERICA
Am I fucking him?

BUFF
Shit.

ERICA
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?

Um, mother-daughter.

Buff shakes a can of beer at crotch level, sending foam and beer 
spray everywhere.

SOOZE
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!

TIM
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, 
Sooze.

her expense.

ERICA
Oh, it's okay. What's your name?

Buff.

ERICA
Buff is funny. God.

TIM
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut 
the feminist hole.

SOOZE
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I 
forgot, it's not big enough.

JEFF
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your 
mother's house?

PONY
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , 
uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier. 

TIM
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.

JEFF
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.

real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You 
live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the

Yeah, we're all above that.

harmonica from off the trunk of the car.

BUFF
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...

PONY
Don't drop the guitar, man.

Buff pretends to almost drop the guitar.

Whoa!

Everyone gathers around Pony, except Jeff.

BUFF
Yes! Free concert!

ERICA
Alright, Pony!

PONY
Alright, alright already.

SOOZE
Alright!

BUFF
Yes! Hey, unplugged Pony!

Pony begins to play and sing.

PONY
(singing)
"Drove down the highway
there was a big jam
The family had died
There inside their minivan
There was a backup
It went on for miles
But as bad as it was
It was gone after a while"
(to group)
Chorus here.
(singing again)
"You may think there's nothing to it
and the truth is hard to see
To be an invisible man is a remarkable
thing to be
thing to be
thing to be"

SOOZE
That was so great!

ERICA
It's coming along.

PONY
Thank you.

BUFF
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.

PONY
Hey, thanks, man.

JEFF
So who are you?

PONY 
What do you mean?

JEFF
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?

PONY
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life 
and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.

JEFF
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.

PONY
What?

JEFF
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?

PONY
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you 
know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to 
people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no 
one hears it, does that make a sound?

JEFF
Of course it does.

SOOZE
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears 
it.

PONY
Mine too.

JEFF
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.

PONY
You know what I'm saying?

SOOZE
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.

BUFF
Wait, what happened to the tree?

JEFF
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no 
one cuts it down.

SOOZE
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.

JEFF
No, I don't.

SOOZE
Yes, you do.

JEFF
No, I don't.

SOOZE
You do.

JEFF
No, I don't.

Tim walks up to the group from behind Erica. He stops and talks 
to her.

TIM
Hi.

ERICA
Hi.

TIM
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?

ERICA
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.

TIM
You rich?

ERICA
No, not really. Middle-class.

TIM
Oh, me too. Middle-class.

ERICA
Maybe upper-middle-class.

Pony is singing another song. Buff, Bee-Bee, and Sooze are all 
sitting on the asphalt in front of Pony, wide eyes. Tim is 
talking to Erica on the car and Jeff is pacing back and forth.

PONY
"See what's around you listen to their lies"

TIM
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?

ERICA
Thinks he is. Well, he is.

TIM
He is?

ERICA
Yes.

TIM
He is.

ERICA
He is.

TIM
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, 
but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I 
know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You 
didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob 
jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.

Tim feels Erica's arms.

TIM (CONT'D)
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.

PONY
"I sound like an idiot
watching the parade
I know there's no tomorrow
only the charade
I am dead
Deep inside my head
All the lies
There's no then
Only now
I will love
show me how"

Bee-Bee stands up and walks away. Jeff watches her leave and 
begins to pace faster.

PONY (CONT'D)
"I buried my hand in a fire
I haven't slept for a week
I cut my feet on the glass
Never finding what I seek
I need salvation
I need"

Suddenly Jeff stops pacing and jumps up screaming.

JEFF
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to 
your concert!

SOOZE
Jeff!

JEFF
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're 
a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You 
got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?

TIM
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.

JEFF
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?

SOOZE
Jesus, Jeff.

PONY
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing 
it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?

JEFF
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a 
limousine to know who I am, alright?

TIM
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.

JEFF
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that 
things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing 
original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. 
I don't have a fucking message.

TIM
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?

JEFF
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.

SOOZE
(sighs)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

PONY
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, 
if I said something wrong. I, I...

JEFF
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you 
know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity 
that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you 
know.

PONY
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here 
and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I 
think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full 
of attitude. I, I really...

JEFF
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. 
Whoo! Hey.

PONY
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean 
food?

ERICA
We'd have to hurry.

SOOZE
China Gate's open till midnight.

PONY
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?

JEFF
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something 
here. Yeah.

PONY
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about 
those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.

BUFF
Limo ride!

Buff runs and jumps into the limo.

PONY
Tim?

TIM
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay 
here and guard the parking lot.

Sooze walks over to Jeff.

SOOZE
Come on.

JEFF
No. No, no, no.

SOOZE
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.

JEFF
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.

SOOZE
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.

Buff sticks his upper body out of the limo's sunroof.

BUFF
Hey, come on, man! Limo!

SOOZE
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did 
you guys see where she went?

PONY
Erica, you coming?

ERICA
Mm-mm.

BUFF
Are you sure? Okay.

The limo pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road. Erica 
walks over to Tim, who is lying on the hood of a car.

ERICA
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.

TIM
What'd he get you?

ERICA
A Porsche.

TIM
Mm.

ERICA
Yeah. So, what about you?

TIM
What about me? I don't have a car.

ERICA
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know 
anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?

TIM
Military marching bands.

ERICA
You think I'm rich and you hate me.

TIM
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know 
me.

ERICA
I'd like to.

Oh, yeah?

Oh, come on! We're hungry. Please?

Buff decides to take control and walks over to the hostess.

BUFF
Yo, do you know who this guy is right here? That's Pony Moynihan 
from MTV. Yeah look at his limo out there.

RESTAURANT HOSTESS

BUFF
TV. MTV, what your going to turn him away?

PONY
(to Buff)
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.

BUFF
No man.
(to hostess)
He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. 
You're lucky he's here.

RESTAURANT HOSTESS
Take-out only. Wait, I get picture.

PONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

BUFF
Thanks. See man?

PONY
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.

SOOZE
Really?

BUFF
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, 
bring the camera in.

PONY
You make videos?

BUFF
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.

PONY
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you 
know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, 
like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, 
"Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed." 

BUFF
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.

PONY
You could do it.

BUFF
I could.

PONY
Yeah!

BUFF
Yeah.

PONY
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do 
you have a reel?

BUFF
Yes!

PONY
Yeah!

BUFF
A reel?

EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Tim and Erica are still chatting away in the parking lot. 

ERICA
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to 
the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking 
the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the 
bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?

TIM
What was your name again?

ERICA
Erica.

TIM
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?

ERICA
Deep down. Way down.

TIM
It's a mistake to think that.

ERICA
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.

TIM
It's nice to do a lot of things.

ERICA
That's what I mean.

TIM
I'm not a nice guy.

ERICA
I know. It's okay.

TIM
Yeah?

ERICA
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't 
want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids 
looking for Chinese food.

TIM
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.

ERICA
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.

They kiss.

INT. PONY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Buff, Sooze, Jeff, and Pony are all in the back of the limo 
coming back from China Gate. Pony's demo tape is playing in the 
background as Buff stuffs his face with noodles.

BUFF
Mm-mm. Hey, when I get shitfaced I can get this huge appetite. 
God. I don't know why. Most people don't, but I do. Whoo!

Suddenly Buff stops eating, his face drawing a blank. He starts 
to look sick.

PONY
You okay, man? You okay?

BUFF
I didn't want to eat this much, man.

PONY
Wait, I'll get you some air.

Pony starts to open the sunroof when Buff jumps up and starts 
heading towards the window.

BUFF
Wait, do the windows, okay? Just do 'em.

Pony opens the window and Buff sticks his head out, throwing up 
alcohol and Chinese noodles all over the side of the limo.

SOOZE
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!

PONY
You done?

BUFF
Yeah.

Buff sticks his head back out of the limo and throws up again 
before finally settling back inside the limo.

LIMO DRIVER
Oh, crap!

The limo pulls over. The driver gets out and begins to wipe the 
throw up off of the side of the limo. Buff is wandering around, 
Jeff is sitting on the curb looking irritated, Pony and Sooze are 
still inside the limo. Sooze is on the car phone.

SOOZE
(into telephone)
Oh, oh, hi. Oh, Missus Douglas, I hope I'm not calling too late. 
No, have you seen Bee-Bee? Well, no, yeah, she was, I was just 
wondering if you'd seen her. She did? Okay. Yeah. No, I'm sorry 
to bother you, Missus Douglas. Okay, 'bye.
(to Jeff)
Shit. She always answers.

Buff is up in someone's front lawn.

BUFF
Hey! Hey, you guys!

Buff comes running from the front yard, holding in both his hands 
a lawn leprechaun.

LIMO DRIVER
No. No. Put back the leprechaun.

JEFF
Yeah, put it back. Oh, fuck. What are you doing, you...

Lights come on inside the house.

Sooze, Buff and Pony are singing an old high school cheer while 
Jeff looks very un-amused.

SOOZE, BUFF, & PONY
"Black and orange

Hear that hearty yell
Rah rah rah"

SOOZE
"G, O, F, O, R, I, T. Go for it!"

BUFF
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.

PONY
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?

JEFF
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?

PONY
Oh, yeah.

JEFF
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...

PONY
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.

George pulls the limo over to the side of the street. Jeff walks 
down a small ravine, looks back over his shoulder, keeps walking.

JEFF
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.

PONY
Burnfield. No place like it.
 
SOOZE
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.

PONY
I can't believe you're still here.

SOOZE
I'm moving.

PONY
If...

SOOZE
No, I'm going.

PONY
Mm-hm.

Sooze and Pony pick at each other with their fingers, playfully 
flirting.

SOOZE
Soon.

PONY
Yep.

SOOZE
What's that supposed to mean?

PONY
I don't know. I say what I mean.

Sooze and Pony are sitting on top of the limo looking out over 
Burnfield.

SOOZE
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out 
of here, you know? I'm ready to go.

PONY
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first 
place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're 
doing.

SOOZE
Yeah.

PONY
I think about you. I mean, a lot.

SOOZE
Me?

PONY
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

SOOZE
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from 
the past.

PONY
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on 
that album cover, right?

SOOZE
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

PONY
You do?

SOOZE
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.

CUT TO:


EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeff walks into the parking lot to find Bee-Bee sitting on the 
side of the building by herself, bottle by her side and listening 
to the radio. Jeff walks up to her.

JEFF
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked 
that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink. 

BEE-BEE
I don't anymore.

JEFF
Can I have some?

BEE-BEE
Knock yourself out.

Jeff takes a hard swing off the bottle.

JEFF
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it 
from a totally different angle and it makes sense.

BEE-BEE
Yeah.

JEFF
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?

BEE-BEE
Sure, all the time, in Group.

JEFF
In Group?

BEE-BEE
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like 
AA.

JEFF
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.

BEE-BEE
Intense.

JEFF
How long were you in there?

BEE-BEE
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm 
rehabilitated.

JEFF
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?

BEE-BEE
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.

JEFF
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.

BEE-BEE
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.

JEFF
It was pretty bad, huh?

BEE-BEE
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the 
walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I 
would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me 
here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, 
because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of 
control. I thought my parents loved me.

INT. PONY'S LIMO - NIGHT

Buff is holding onto the lawn leprechaun as if it was his 
girlfriend. He comes in and out of sleep.

BUFF
Hey, do you got any water? And some B-One? Hey, where did 
everybody go?

LIMO DRIVER
Hey, hey. Okay?

BUFF
Sor-sorry, Bruce.

CUT TO:


EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

JEFF
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were 
doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen 
feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started 
walking.

BEE-BEE
Yeah.

JEFF
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, 
I was jealous of Pony.

BEE-BEE
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and 
you've got nothing.

JEFF
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that 
limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck 
with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him 
to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, 
and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.

BEE-BEE
Yeah, I guess.

JEFF
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what 
was coming in my life.

BEE-BEE
Mm-hm.

JEFF
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if 
I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You 
know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all 
talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. 
Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. 
"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what 
makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I 
don't care about the result.

Jeff begins to remove articles of his clothing.

JEFF (CONT'D)
Anything is possible. It is night on planet earth and I'm alive. 
And someday I'll be dead. Someday I'll just be bones in a box, 
but right now, I', not. And anything is possible. And that's why 
I can go to New York with Sooze because each moment can just be 
what it is. There's no failure, there's no mistake. I just, I 
just go there and live there and what happens, happens. And so, 
right now I'm getting naked and I'm not afraid. You know? I 
don't, I don't need money, man. I don't, I don't even need, I 
don't even need a future. I, I could knock out all of my teeth 
with a hammer. So what?! You know, I could poke my eyes out. I'd 
still be alive, you know? At least I'd know that I was doing 
something real for two or three seconds, you know? It's all about 
feat and I'm not afraid anymore, man. Fuck it! Fuck fear!

Jeff is standing in the middle of the parking lot, completely 
nude. Tim appears from on top of the roof.

Jeff is putting his clothes back on. He sits down next to Bee-Bee 
and takes another swing off the bottle.

BEE-BEE
Jeff? Do you, do you ever wake up in the morning and think, 
"Well, here's another day"? You know? It's just like the last 
one. I mean what difference does it make, you know.

Tim is on the roof of the Circle A watching Pony and Sooze get

You know, my mom has this saying.

PONY
Yeah?

SOOZE
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."

PONY
Really? What else does your mother say?

JEFF
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.

SOOZE
(to Bee-Bee)
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.

BEE-BEE
Uh, home, you know.

SOOZE
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I 
didn't get you in trouble.

BEE-BEE
You didn't get me in trouble.

PONY
Hey, where's Erica?

JEFF
I don't know.

SOOZE
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some 
alcoholic nudist colony.

JEFF
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape 
over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking 
groupie, you know. 

SOOZE
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.

JEFF
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.

SOOZE
What?

JEFF
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked 
all the way here.

SOOZE
Mm-hm.

JEFF
And I fig- and I figured something out.

SOOZE
Oh, yeah?

JEFF
I, yeah.

SOOZE
Mm.

Buff comes running from around the corner holding the lawn 
leprechaun. Tim walks from around the corner and opens a box of 
the take out Chinese.

BUFF
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the 
city.

TIM
So, how was the ride, kids?

BUFF
Great.

TIM
Really?

SOOZE
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.

TIM
Oh that's nice for you.
 
PONY
Where's Erica? You seen her?

TIM
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.

PONY
Oh, How'd she get back?

TIM
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?

JEFF
I don't know.

PONY
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.

Pony walks away, around the corner.

BUFF
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.

TIM
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!

JEFF
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's 
something I figured out.

SOOZE
God, you smell like whiskey.

JEFF
No, no, I have to talk to you.

SOOZE
Is that a threat?

TIM
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this 
sparerib.

JEFF
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.

SOOZE
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York 
anymore.

TIM
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. 
Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, 
shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's 
still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any 
money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't 
cash".

Sooze's face drops a little in surprise. 

JEFF
Tim, what are you talking about?

TIM
Ask your girlfriend.

Pony walks back to the group.

PONY
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.

TIM
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.

PONY
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.

TIM
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.

PONY
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?

TIM
About what?

PONY
About where she went. I mean, what bar?

TIM
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.

PONY
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say 
exactly?

TIM
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

SOOZE
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?

PONY
I think I gotta go.

JEFF
See ya later.

TIM
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?

PONY
Fuck you, man. I never did anything to you!

Tim gets up gets into Pony's face.

TIM
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I 
might have to.

PONY
Whatever.

TIM
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are 
really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

PONY
Don't do that, man, okay?

SOOZE
Could you give me a ride?

TIM
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to 
the hotel.

SOOZE
Tim, go throw up somewhere.

PONY
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?

TIM
It's none of my business?

PONY
Yeah.

TIM
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying 
to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my 
business?!

SOOZE
What the fuck are you talking about?!

PONY
Nobody's fucking anybody!

TIM
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then 
you're fucking with me.

PONY
Don't do that.

TIM
What are you going to do? Hm?

PONY
If you hit me...

TIM
Yeah?

PONY
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster 
than you can say AA, okay?

TIM
Your manager?

PONY
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

TIM
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find 
me, right?

PONY
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy 
another beer. It's on me, okay?

BUFF
Thanks, man!

PONY
(to Sooze)
I'll be in the car, okay?

JEFF
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?

SOOZE
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? 
Maybe you want to think about it.

JEFF
Where are you going?

SOOZE
For a ride.

JEFF
Wait, away?

SOOZE
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.

JEFF
To his hotel?

SOOZE
Shit, Jeff!

SOOZE

JEFF
Wait. What, what are you saying?

SOOZE
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.

JEFF
Well, what about us?

SOOZE
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

JEFF
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.

SOOZE
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's 
maybe not?

JEFF
Oh, no, no, no.

SOOZE
You're unbelievable.

JEFF
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.

SOOZE
You did, huh? Good for you.

JEFF
Oh, fuck it, man!

BUFF
Fuck it!

JEFF
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.

BUFF
In the limo!!!

Buff runs off to the limo.

JEFF
Do your covers and all that shit.

SOOZE
'Bye, Jeff.

JEFF
Go.

SOOZE
What?

JEFF
Just go.

Sooze walks up to him and gets in his face.

SOOZE
You really suck, you know that?

JEFF
Just go.

Sooze walks away and into the limo. Tim walks over to Jeff.

TIM
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky 
said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without 
suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.

JEFF
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.

TIM
Good. That's good.

Tim and Jeff walk towards the front of the store. Jeff stops at 
the corner and looks at Bee-Bee for a long moment, then 
disappears behind the corner. Bee-Bee downs the entire bottle of 
whisky that was at her side.

EXT. CIRCLE A - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeff and Tim walk by the small glass window that Nazeer sits 
behind. Jeff raps it with his comb before walking up to catch up 
with Jeff. Nazeer picks up the phone. Jeff and Tim stop in the 
middle of the parking lot by the pumps.

TIM
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy 
probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, 
nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep 
significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big 
brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. 
You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?

JEFF
No.

TIM
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? 
Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. 
And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night 
together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their 
underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's 
parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.

JEFF
What?

TIM
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?

JEFF
Yeah, fuck 'em.

TIM
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!

JEFF
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!

Jeff throws his box of rice, hitting the big window on the Circle 
A food shop.

TIM
Yes! Your learning, kid. That's right! You're learning. Oh, it's 
the man.

Chip and Gary pull into the Circle A with their cruiser. They get 
out and walk over to the boys.

CHIP
What's up guys?

TIM
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?

Nazeer comes running out of the store.

NAZEER
This one.
(points at Tim)
He causes all the trouble.

CHIP 
Been drinking again, Timmy-boy?

TIM
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow 
me, I'm drunk.

CHIP
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.

TIM
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.

CHIP
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front 
of your friend.

TIM
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?

GARY
Asshole. Cuff him and stuff him.

They start to put Tim in the car, he resists.

CHIP
Will you stand up for me?

TIM
Okay.

CHIP
Come on. Inside.

TIM
Okay. We'll go for a ride.

They put Tim in the cruiser and walk over to question Nazeer.

GARY
Can you tell me what happened?

NAZEER
He's drunk.

GARY
Uh-huh.

NAZEER
He causes problems. He was here earlier.

Tim screams to Jeff from inside the car.

TIM
Hey, Jeff!

Jeff walks over the police cruiser and squats down next to the 
window.

JEF
Yeah.

TIM
You gotta help me out, man. I'm in trouble.

JEFF
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down 
and, and get you out.

TIM
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, 
Jeff.

JEFF
What? What'd you do?

TIM
That chick, Erica?

JEFF
Well, w-what happened?

TIM
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' 
all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And 
she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. 
Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her 
stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And 
I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...

JEFF
What'd you do?

TIM
I hit her.

JEFF
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?

TIM
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she 
didn't move anymore.

JEFF
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?

TIM
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.

JEFF
Oh fuck.

The cops get in the car and pull away. Nazeer walks over to Jeff.

NAZEER
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...

JEFF
I don't know.

NAZEER
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.

JEFF
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand 
what is going on with me.

NAZEER
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?

JEFF
That's right.

NAZEER
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?

Jeff walks away from Nazeer.

Jeff is sitting on the side of the Circle A by himself. He looks

clean and very awake.

BUFF
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?

JEFF
No, no.

BUFF
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of 
coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, 
long, long night.

Buff walks into the Circle A to get the coffee. Jeff makes his 
way over to the pay phone and dials a number. Nazeer, who is 
sweeping the parking lot stares at him.

JEFF
(into telephone)
Hi, uh, yeah, I'd, like to report a... What? No, yeah, no, I'd 
like to report a, report a crime. No, I can't hold, I don't... 
alright.

Buff walks up with the coffee.

BUFF
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze? 

JEFF
No.

Buff walks out into the parking lot, next to Nazeer.

BUFF
It's gonna be a beautiful fucking day, man.

Buff throws the wrapper of the donut stick he's eating on the 
ground. Nazeer stares at him. Quickly Buff picks up the wrapper 
and runs towards the dumpster.

BUFF
Oh, God! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two!

Buff slams the wrapper into the dumpster.

NAZEER
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.

BUFF
Are you talking to me?

NAZEER
It's okay.

BUFF
Glad it's okay.

NAZEER
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm 
swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.

BUFF
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I 
don't speak Swahili.

NAZEER
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the 
store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you 
standing here.

BUFF
Good. See you later.

NAZEER
You're a drunk and an idiot.

BUFF
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves 
it. That's okay.

NAZEER
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the 
salt is rotten or the meat."

Nazeer starts to go back into the store.

BUFF
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out 
to L.A.

NAZEER
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you 
to stand in front of.

Nazeer walks back into the store. Buff goes back around to the 
side of the building where Jeff is sitting against the wall.

BUFF
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?

JEFF
No, no, I wasn't trying.

BUFF
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't 
worry about that.

JEFF
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.

BUFF
No. Life is too short.

JEFF
No, I'm not worried.

BUFF
Good.

JEFF
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, 
you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright? 

BUFF
Sure.

JEFF
No, I mean, no one.

BUFF
Hey, you know me.

JEFF
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.

BUFF
Yeah.

JEFF
Uh, last night...

BUFF
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my 
friend, she's your old lady.

JEFF
No, no.

BUFF
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...

JEFF
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, 
wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?

BUFF
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. 
Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We 
talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. 
Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a 
great tape.

JEFF
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?

BUFF
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about 
making a video. But that's a plus.

JEFF
No.

BUFF
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of 
view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...

JEFF
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-

BUFF
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.

JEFF
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?

BUFF
Oh, and guess who showed up.

JEFF
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.

BUFF
I know, man.

JEFF
You know?

BUFF
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?

JEFF
What, they're looking for her?

BUFF
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great 
time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I 
say?

JEFF
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?

BUFF
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.

JEFF
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.

BUFF
Y- s-sure it did.

JEFF
No. It didn't, Buff.

BUFF
Wait. Hey, man.

JEFF
Erica is in the van back there.

BUFF
What?

JEFF
Look.

BUFF
Hey, man.

JEFF
She's in the van.

BUFF
What she doin' in the van, man?

JEFF
Buff...

BUFF
What?

JEFF
She's dead.

BUFF
She's dead?

JEFF
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

BUFF
Tim...

JEFF
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.

BUFF
Bullshit.

JEFF
No, no, no.

BUFF
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.

JEFF
Oh, really? You wanna go look?

BUFF
Yeah, man.

JEFF
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!

BUFF
It's bullshit. Look! Look!

Pony's limo pulls into the parking lot, and Erica pops out.

ERICA
Cock-a-doole-doo! Good morning!

Erica throws herself on Buff.

BUFF
Hey! Hey.

ERICA
I'm so burnt-out.

BUFF
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?

ERICA
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.

BUFF
Yeah?

Erica notices her pager in Jeff's hand.

ERICA
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. 
(to Buff)
Did you get your tape?

BUFF
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to 
Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me 
how to surf in L.A. 

ERICA
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.

BUFF
I can come visit?

ERICA
You better! Yes!

BUFF
I will.

ERICA
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you 
should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he 
had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading 
some of your songs.

JEFF
Yeah, tell Pony to go fuck himself.

ERICA
Okay, I'll do that. Okay, hurry up.

Erica and Buff play fight. It look's like a mix between an old 
kung-fu movie and a cat fight. Erica gets back into the limo.

BUFF
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!
(to Jeff)
Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!

JEFF
Guess not.

BUFF
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.

JEFF
No.

BUFF
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I 
gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a 
video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the 
flow.

JEFF
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.

Buff jumps into the limo. 

BUFF
Hey, George.

The limo pulls off and it passes Tim who just entered the parking 
lot.

BUFF
(to Tim)
Hey, man.

TIM
Hey.

Tim walks over to Jeff and cracks open a new beer.

JEFF
They let you out?

TIM
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some 
class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? 
She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. 
Oh, shit.

JEFF
You lied to me.

TIM
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe 
so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're 
gullible and you're gutless.

JEFF
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all 
night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, 
yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you 
wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.

TIM
Wow. You did that for me?

JEFF
Yes.

TIM
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.

JEFF
Why? Because I give a shit?

TIM
Oh, shit.

JEFF
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?

TIM
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go 
look in the van, did you?

JEFF
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied 
to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.

TIM
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.

JEFF
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? 
He's just gonna call the cops again.

TIM
Good, good. I, I hope he does.

JEFF
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.

TIM
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. 
Did you think she was gonna use it?

JEFF
I don't know.

TIM
You don't know?

JEFF
No.

TIM
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, 
her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?

JEFF
No.

Tim pulls a gun out of his pants and loads it.

TIM
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably 
went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and 
had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes 
me sick.

JEFF
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. 
Go home and sleep it off.

TIM
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm 
supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I 
be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a 
fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.

JEFF
Just go home, alright?

TIM
This is my home.

JEFF
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never 
hurt you.

TIM
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. 
You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think 
they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? 
I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from 
me.

JEFF
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?

TIM
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These 
assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? 
Well, they don't know shit.

JEFF
Will you just put the gun down?

TIM
No.

JEFF
Just put it down.

Nazeer walks out of the store.

NAZEER
What is this... now , huh?

Jeff starts to walk towards Nazeer.

TIM
Jeff, stay there.

JEFF
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

TIM
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops 
and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.

NAZEER
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.

TIM
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of 
handles these heavy matters anyway, right?

NAZEER
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.

TIM
Well, what about this?

Nazeer pulls out his gun and points it at Tim.

NAZEER
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.

TIM
Camel jockey.

NAZEER
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. 
I'm only working here.

TIM
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.

JEFF
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?

NAZEER
Look, why do you care, huh?

JEFF
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get 
like this, My name's Jeff.

NAZEER
Okay. Nazeer, okay?

JEFF
Nazeer what?

NAZEER
Nazeer Chaudry!

TIM
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an 
application?

JEFF
That, that's Indian?

NAZEER
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.

TIM
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.

NAZEER
Please. Look...

JEFF
Please?

NAZEER
Look, look, just get off my property.

TIM
What?

Tim jumps up on top of the dumpster.

NAZEER
Look, get down off my property.

TIM
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for 
standing on your fucking trash can?

NAZEER
Get off my property!

TIM
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.

NAZEER
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.

TIM
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.

JEFF
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.

TIM
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!

Tim fires three shots into the air.

NAZEER
Get off my fucking roof, you fucking drunk! You bum! 

Pakeesa runs out to them , screaming in Pakistani.

NAZEER
Look Pakeesa...

TIM
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?

NAZEER
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!

TIM
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! 
Come on! Come on, man! Come on!

Tim walks further onto the roof. We can't see him anymore.

NAZEER
Get off my roof!

TIM
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!

NAZEER
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's 
enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.

Tim comes back into view holding Bee-Bee, who's unconscious, in 
his arms.

TIM
Jeff! Come up here!

JEFF
Is that Bee-Bee?

TIM
Come on! 

Pakeesa is screaming at Nazeer louder now.

NAZEER
Look, look, you see? They were drinking on the roof and, what, is 
she drunk? J-just get her off! What are you saying?

Tim is handing Bee-Bee's unconscious body down off the dumpster 
to Jeff.

TIM
Ready?

NAZEER
What are you saying?

Jeff places Bee-Bee on the ground and starts to check her vital 
signs. Tim jumps down off the dumpster. 

TIM
You got her? Fuck.

Tim walks past Nazeer and over to the pay phone.

TIM
I hope you're happy!

NAZEER
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.

TIM
No, this has everything to do with you.

NAZEER
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.

TIM
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. 
(into phone)
Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first 
Street, Yeah, Okay.
(to Nazeer)
You're fucked now, pal!
(into phone)
Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or 
something. Okay. Okay.
(to Jeff)
Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to 
Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.
(to Nazeer)
Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever 
showed your brown face in this town!

Tim runs off. Nazeer is getting screamed at by Pakeesa.

NAZEER
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I 
tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!
(to Jeff)
How is she?

JEFF
I don't know. I think she's breathing.

NAZEER
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's 
not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going 
inside.

Nazeer starts to walk back inside, but stops.

NAZEER (CONT'D)
Oh, God. You people are so stupid! What's wrong with you?! Throw 
it all away, huh?! You throw it all away!

SLOW FADE OUT



THE END
