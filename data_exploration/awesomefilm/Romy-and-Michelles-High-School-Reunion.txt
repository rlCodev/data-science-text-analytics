["Just a Girl" plays]     

[ Woman #1 from "Pretty Woman"]
HOW MUCH IS THIS, LORI ? 
  
[ Woman #2 ]
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. 
  
[ Woman #1 ] 
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. 
WELL, I GOT MONEY TO SPEND IN HERE. 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING FOR YOU. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY IN THE 
WRONG PLACE. 
PLEASE LEAVE. 

[ Michele ] 
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE WATCHED PRETTY WOMAN, LIKE, 36 TIMES, 
I NEVER GET TIRED OF MAKING FUN OF IT. 

[ Romy ]
OH, I KNOW. 
AW, POOR THING. 
LOOK, THEY WON'T LET HER SHOP. 
YEAH, LIKE THOSE SALESGIRLS IN BEVERLY HILLS AREN'T BIGGER WHORES 
THAN SHE IS. 

[ Michele ]

[ Giggles ] 
I KNOW ! 

[ Piano: Mournful ] 

[ Romy ]  
OH, MY GOD, LISTEN TO THAT SAD, SAD MUSIC AS SHE LEAVES. 

[ Michele ]  
IT'S, LIKE, "BOO-HOO." 
UHH ! 

[ Laughs ] 
BUT IT IS, ACTUALLY,  KIND OF SAD. 

[ movie continues ] 

[ Salesman ]  
ANYTHING YOU SEE HERE, WE CAN DO.  GET READY TO HAVE SOME FUN.  
OKAY? 
MARY PAT, MARY KATE, MARY FRANCIS, TOVAH ? LET'S SEE IT.  COME 
ON. 

[ Stifled Giggle ] 

[ TV Continues, Faint ] 

[ Michele ]  
I JUST GET REALLY HAPPY WHEN THEY FINALLY LET HER SHOP. 

[ Romy ]  
OKAY, SO I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR. 
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO MAKE ANYTHING NEW BEFORE WE GO OUT. 

[ Michele ] 
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS ? DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT ? 

[ Romy ]
ACTUALLY, I HAVE BEEN TRYING THIS NEW FAT-FREE DIET I INVENTED.  
ALL I'VE HAD TO EAT FOR THE PAST SIX DAYS ARE GUMMI BEARS, JELLY 
BEANS AND CANDY CORNS. 

[ Michele ]
GOD, I WISH I HAD YOUR DISCIPLINE. 

[ Romy ] 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CUTE I LOOK. 

[ Michele ]  
I KNOW ! 

[ Romy ]  
YOU KNOW WHAT?  THIS IS, LIKE, THE CUTEST WE'VE EVER LOOKED. 

[ Michele ]
OH, IT'S DEFINITELY THE CUTEST. 

[ Romy ]
DON'T YOU LOVE HOW WE CAN SAY THAT TO EACH OTHER... AND KNOW 
WE'RE NOT BEING CONCEITED ? 

[ Michele ] 
 OH, I KNOW. NO, WE'RE JUST BEING HONEST. 
   
[ Music: "BE MY LOVER"]
   
[ Crowd Shouting, Chattering ] 
   
[ Continues ] 

[ Romy ]
GOD, I HOPE SOME CUTE GUYS GET HERE TONIGHT. 

THEY WERE CUTE LAST NIGHT. 

[ Michele ]
THEY WERE CUTE ! 

[ Romy ]  
REALLY CUTE ! 

[ Michele ]  
OHH ! 

[ Bartender ]  
HEY, MICHELE, ROMY. 

[ Romy ]  
WE'LL TAKE TWO DIET COKES. 

[ Bartender ]
RIGHT, WITH EXTRA CHERRIES. DON'T MOVE.  I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 

[Michele]  
OKAY.  I HAVE THE YUCKIEST TASTE IN MY MOUTH FROM THOSE TAQUITOS. 

[ Romy ]  
OOH. 

[ Michele ]
I HOPE I DON'T GET INDIGESTION. 
'MEMBER THAT TIME I BARFED FROM BAD MEXICAN FOOD?   IT WAS SO 
GROSS. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, MY GOD, I HATE THROWING UP IN PUBLIC. 

[ Michele ] 
 ME TOO ! 

[ Romy ]
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GUYS HERE TONIGHT. 

[ Michele ]
I KNOW.  NONE. 

[ Romy ]  
COME ON, MICHELE, LET'S JUST GO DANCE WITH OURSELVES. 

[ Michele ]  
OKAY. 
  
[ Stayin' Alive" plays ] 
  
[ Continues ] 

[ Romy ]  
SWEAR TO GOD, SOMETIMES I WISH I WERE A LESBIAN. 

[ Michele ]  
DO YOU WANNA TRY TO HAVE SEX SOME TIME, JUST TO SEE IF WE ARE ? 

[ Romy ]  
WHAT ? YEAH, RIGHT, MICHELE. JUST THE THOUGHT OF HAVING SEX WITH 
ANOTHER WOMAN CREEPS ME OUT.  BUT IF WE'RE NOT MARRIED BY THE 
TIME WE'RE 30, ASK ME AGAIN. 

[ Michele ]
OKAY. 
  
[ Rap Continues ] 
   
[ Romy, Faintly ]

[ Romy Clears Throat ] 
TWO-FOUR-THREE.  SERVICE. NUMBER 2-4-3. 
  
[ Man ]  
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.  IS THAT REAL WOOD ? 
  
[ Romy exhales on P.A. ] 
DURING THIS CENTURY, BOYS. 
  
[ Clears Throat ] 
COME ON, RAMON, QUIT JERKING OFF AND BRING THE CAR AROUND. 
  
[ Tires Screech, Engine Off ] 
  
[ Door Closes ] 
IT'S ABOUT TIME. 

[ Ramon ] 
MMM !  ROMY. YOU ARE LOOKIN' HOT... TODAY. 

[ Romy ]  
YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SWEATING LIKE A PIG IN HERE. 

[ Ramon ]
THE AIR CONDITIONING'S WORKING IN THE SERVICE OFFICE. YOU MIGHT 
WANT TO COME BY AND, UH, COOL OFF LATER ? 

[ Romy ]
YEAH, RAMON.  THAT'LL HAPPEN. 
SORRY, MA'AM.   HE IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE. 

[ Man Clears Throat ] 

[ Heather ]  
I'M IN A HURRY. 

[ Romy ] 
WELL, I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN, MISS... MOONEY. 
"HEATHER." HEATHER MOONEY ? FROM SAGEBRUSH HIGH IN TUCSON ? 

[ Heather ]
YEAH ? 

[ Romy ] 
IT'S ROMY.   ROMY WHITE ! 

[ Heather ]  
YOU'RE SHITTIN' ME. 

[ Romy ]  
NO ! 
THIS IS SO WEIRD ! 
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE LIVING IN L.A. 

[ Heather ]  
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW, WILL WE GETTING TOGETHER  A LOT ? 

[ Romy ]  

[ Braying Laugh ] 
SO, GOD, YOU'RE DRIVING A NEW JAGUAR ?   WHAT DO YOU DO ? 

[ Heather ]  
EVER HEAR OF LADY FAIR CIGARETTES ?  

[ Romy ]
THE ONES THAT BURN DOWN FAST ? 


[ Heather ]  
TWICE THE TASTE IN HALF THE TIME FOR THE GAL ON THE GO.  I 
INVENTED THE QUICK-BURNING PAPER. 

[ Romy ]  
WOW. 
  
[ Chuckles ] 

[ Heather ]  
YOU GOIN' TO THE REUNION ? 

[ Romy ] 
 WHAT REUNION ? 

[ Heather ]  
OUR TEN-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION IN TUCSON. 

[ Romy ]  
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.  IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL ? 
GOD.  WHERE HAVE I BEEN ? 

[ Heather ]  
I'M STUMPED. 
WHERE ? 

[ Romy ]
  
[ Laughs ] 
ANYWAY, ARE YOU GOING ? 

[ Heather ]  
I'D RATHER PUT THIS OUT IN MY ASS. 

[ Romy ]  
I WONDER WHY WE DIDN'T GET AN INVITATION.  I'M SURE MICHELE WOULD 
HAVE TOLD ME IF SHE GOT ONE. 

[ Heather ]  
MICHELE WEINBERGER ? 

[ Romy ]  
MM-HMM. 

[ Heather ]  
DO YOU LIVE WITH MICHELE WEINBERGER ? 

[ Romy ]  
YEAH. 
  
[ Shudders, Chuckles ] 

[ Heather ]  
I JUST THOUGHT SHE'D BE MARRIED TO SANDY BY NOW. 

[ Romy ]  
SANDY FRINK ? 
   
[ Chuckles ] 

[ Heather ]  
YES, SANDY FRINK.   HE COULD BARELY CONTAIN HIS ERECTION EVERY 
TIME  SHE WAS AROUND.   WHY DO YOU THINK HE ALWAYS CARRIED THAT 
HUGE NOTEBOOK ? 

[ Romy ]  
THE FRINK-A-ZOID AND MICHELE ?  I'M SURE.   BESIDES, DIDN'T YOU 
HAVE A THING FOR SANDY IN HIGH SCHOOL ? 

[ Heather ]  
I DID NOT HAVE A "THING."   I DID NOT HAVE A "THING."  I WAS VERY 
MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM. VERY MUCH IN LOVE.  AND THERE'S A 
DIFFERENCE.  THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. 
  
[ Whispers ] 
  I HAVE TO GO NOW. 
  
[ Receipt Printing ] 
  
[ Tears Receipt ] 
  

[ Romy ]
WELL-- 
  
[ Clears Throat ] 
I GUESS I WON'T BE SEEING YOU AT THE REUNION, BUT I'LL TELL 
EVERYONE YOU 
SAID "HI." 

[ Heather ]
WHY DON'T YOU TELL EVERYONE TO GO FUCK THEMSELVES FOR MAKING MY 
TEEN YEARS A LIVING HELL. 

[ Romy ]
   
[ Laughs] 
OH, YEAH, RIGHT. 

[ Lady ]  
FINALLY. 
 
[Sighs ] 
 

[ Romy ]
  [Dialing ]   
MICHELE, YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHO I JUST RAN INTO. 
  [Giggling ] 

[ Romy ]  
GOD, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY BEEN TEN YEARS. 

[ Michele ]  
I KNOW. 
  
[ Gasps ] 
  
[ Romy ]
THERE SHE IS. OHH ! GOD, SHE WAS SO WEIRD. SHE STILL IS. 

[ Michele ]
WHY WAS SHE ALWAYS GOING BEHIND THAT BUILDING ? 
["Blood and Roses" plays]

  GOT A LIGHT ? 
 
[ Heather ]
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU ! 
THANK YOU ! 
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, BECAUSE I'M NOT A HUMAN BEING OR 
ANYTHING, YOU PATHETIC TURD ! 
  
[ School Bell Rings ] 

[ Heather ] 
THERE SHOULD BE A CIGARETTE YOU CAN SMOKE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
BETWEEN CLASSES.  WHAT A WASTE. 
  
[ Romy ]
OKAY, FIND US. 

[ Michele ]  
OH.  OKAY. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, MY GOD, 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT A BIG CONTROVERSY IT WAS...  FOR US TO HAVE 
OUR  PICTURE TAKEN TOGETHER ? 
  
[ Laughing ] 

[ Michele ]  
YEAH, WELL, DANNY WELLER, LIKE, LODGED THAT COMPLAINT AND, YOU 
KNOW-- 
'CAUSE, ALPHABETICALLY, HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BETWEEN US. 


[ Romy ]  
THEN WE SAID, "OKAY, DANNY, IF WANNA BE BETWEEN US, YOU CAN COME 
TO MICHELE'S HOUSE ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND WE'LL BE WAITING." 

[ Michele ]  
THAT'S RIGHT.    HE CAME OVER AND WE'RE LIKE, "DANNY, IT WAS A 
JOKE." 

[ Romy ]  
I KNOW !   AND THEN WE TURNED THE SPRINKLERS ON HIM ! 

[ Michele ]  
OH, MY GOD ! 
DIDN'T HE DIE ? 

[ Romy ]  
I THINK SO. 

[ Michele ]  
YEAH. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, MY GOD, MICHELE.   LOOK AT THE "A" GROUP. 

[ Michele ] 
MM-HMM. 

[ Romy ]  
CHRISTIE MASTERS, KELLY POSSENGER, LISA LUDER, AND CHERYL QUICK. 

[ Michele ]  
SO, WHO WOULD YOU SAY... WAS IN THE "B" GROUP ? 

[ Romy ]  
OH.  THE DRAMA CROWD.  YOU KNOW, LIKE CASEY DEGAN AND MARK BLACK. 

[ Michele ]  
UH-HUH.  GOD, I HAD THE HUGEST CRUSH ON CASEY. 
'MEMBER ? 

[ Romy ]  
OH, YEAH. 

[ Michele ]  
GOD, I WONDER WHY HE NEVER LIKED ME. 
  
[ Village people's "YMCA" plays in background] 
  
[ Car Horn Honking ] 

[ Michele ]  
SO, WHAT GROUP WOULD YOU SAY WE WERE IN ? 

[ Romy ]  
WELL, WE DEFINITELY WEREN'T IN THE "A" GROUP. 
BUT WE WEREN'T REALLY IN THE "B" GROUP EITHER. 

[ Michele ]  
OKAY, WE WEREN'T IN THE "C" GROUP, WERE WE ? 

[ Romy ]  
WHAT ?  OH, NO. 
MICHELE, COME ON.  THAT WAS, LIKE, ALL THE HONOR STUDENTS AND 
REJECTS. 
YOU KNOW, LIKE SANDY FRINK AND HEATHER MOONEY. 

[ Michele ]  
EEEW, LOOK AT THEM. 

[ Romy ]
WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT IN THAT GROUP. 
  
[ Michele ]
ECCH ! 

["She Blinded Me With Science" plays ] 

[ Sandy ] 
MICHELE !  OH, MICHELE !  OVER HERE ! 

[ Heather ]  
WANT ME TO GET YOUR HUGE NOTEBOOK FOR YOU ? 


[ Toby ]
OH, HEATHER, I WANNA TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE OF YOU AND SANDY FOR 
THE YEARBOOK ! 
  
[ Gasps ] 
I WANNA INTERVIEW YOU TOO... BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A 
REALLY INTERESTING ARTICLE FOR THE ROUNDUP. 

[ Heather ] 
OHH, TOBY ! 
FUCK OFF. 

[ Toby ]  
OKAY.  BUT CAN I TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU FIRST ? 

[ Michele ]  
SO, ROMY, WHAT GROUP WERE WE IN ? 

[ Romy ]  
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WERE REALLY IN ANY GROUP. 
I THINK MAYBE WE WERE MORE LIKE LONERS. 
OH, MY GOD !  THERE WE ARE ! 
  
[ Michele ] 
YEAH, AND ALONE. 

[ Romy ]  
LOOK. 

[ Michele ]  
EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO WEAR THAT STUPID BACK BRACE AND YOU WERE 
KINDA FAT,  WE WERE STILL TOTALLY CUTTING EDGE. 

[ Romy ] 
 I LOVE IT WHEN IT'S HAMBURGER DAY. 

[ Michele ]  
UH-HUH. 
  
[ Toby ] 
OKAY, SMILE ! 
  
[ Shutter Clicks ] 
GREAT !  THANKS A LOT ! 
OH, PLEASE.  CAN I TAKE YOUR PICTURE ? 

[ Mr. Lish ]
HELLO, GIRLS.  DON'T FORGET YOU HAVE DETENTION AFTER SCHOOL 
TODAY. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, WE WON'T, MR. LISH. 

[ Michele ]  
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. 
  
[ Snickers, Laughs ] 
  
[ Giggles ] 

[ Romy ]  
GOD ! CAN YOU BELIEVE HE JUST GOT MARRIED ?   
LIKE, HOW DESPERATE IS SHE ? 

[ Michele ]  
I KNOW. IT'S LIKE: "HI.  THIS IS MY HUSBAND. HE DISSECTS 
CRAYFISH, BUT HE HAS A REALLY GOOD PERSONALITY." 
   
[ Romy ] 
OH, MY GOD. 
MICHELE.   BILLY CHRISTIANSON. 
OH, HE'S SO CUTE. 

[ Michele ]
HE IS CUTE. 

[ Romy ]  
REALLY CUTE. 
HI, BILLY. 
     

[ Billy Chortling ] 

[ Christie ]  
OH !  BILLY ! 
GOSH, YOU'RE SO SLIMY ! 

[ Romy ]  
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE'S WITH CHRISTIE MASTERS. 

[ Michele ]  
I KNOW.  SHE IS, LIKE, SO TRANSPARENT. 

[ Romy ]  
DID YOU HEAR HER REPORT IN MISS WEIGATT'S CLASS ? SHE ACTUALLY 
THINKS SHE'S 
GONNA BE A TV ANCHORWOMAN.   WHAT A "DELUDANOID." 
  
[ Giggling ] 

[ Girl #1 ]  
THOSE WEIRDOS ARE STARING AT US AGAIN. 

[ Girl #2 ] 
 THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH US. 

[ Christie ]  
LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE WEARING.   WHERE DO YOU EVEN GET OUTFITS 
THAT HIDEOUS ? 

[ Lisa ]  
THEY MADE THEM IN HOME EC FROM THEIR OWN PATTERNS.  
ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY'RE SEMI-INTERESTING. IN A FREAKISH, OFF-
PUTTING SORT OF WAY.  NEVER MIND. 

[ Billy ]
CHRISTIE, COME ON. 
I'M HUNGRY. 

[ Christie ]  
NO, BILLY, WAIT. 
I WANNA HAVE SOME FUN. 
LISA, GIMME THE BAG. 
  
[ Giggles ] 

[ Lisa ]  
HERE YOU GO. 
YOU ARE SO BAD. 
  
[ Giggles ] 

[ Girls ] 
WHAT ?

[ Lisa ]  
SHE IS OUT OF CONTROL. 
  
[ Giggling ] 

[ Romy ]
MICHELE, CHRISTIE MASTERS IS COMING OVER HERE. 
  
[ Michele ] 
WOW.  SHE NEVER COMES OVER. 

[ Romy ]  
OKAY, JUST ACT COOL. 

[ Christie ]

[ Michele ]
YOU'RE KIDDING ! 

[ Michele, singing ]
OH, THE WELLS FARGO WAGON IS A-COMIN' DOWN THE STREET  
I LOVE THE MUSIC MAN. 
  
[ Squeak ] 

[ Christie ]  
OKAY...
CAN I HAVE THE REST OF THIS ? 

[ Romy ]  
UM, W--     MMM. 
IT'S GOOD. 
SEE YA ! 
  
[ Squeak ] 

[ Michele ] 
SHE CAN BE REALLY NICE WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE. 

[ Sandy ]
MICHELE ! 
  
[ Giggles ] 

[ Romy ]
UH-OH, DON'T LOOK NOW.  HERE COMES THE FRINK-A-ZOID. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, GOD, HE IS SUCH A GEEK. 

[ Sandy ]
HI, MICHELE. 

[ Squeak ] 
GEE, MICHELE, YOU'RE LOOKING REALLY LOVELY TODAY. 

[ Michele ]
OKAY.  SEE YOU IN BIOLOGY. 
  
[ Squeak ] 

[ Sandy ]
I-I-I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU, MICHELE, THAT... CHRISTIE 
MASTERS STUCK MAGNETS ON YOUR BACK. 

[ Michele ]
WHAT ? 

[ Sandy ]
SHE STUCK-- 

[ Romy ]
MICHELE, YOU DO HAVE  MAGNETS ON YOUR BACK. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, MY GOD. 
OH, MY GOD. 
  
[ Girls Laughing ] 
OH, MY GOD. HELP ME. OH, MY GOD. 
  
[ Laughing Continues ] 

[ Romy ]
DON'T LET THEM SEE YOU GET UPSET. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. 
    
[ Michele ]
OH, MY GOD. 
  
[ More Laughing. Romy joins in ] 
HEY ! 

[ Romy ]
 I'M PRETENDING YOU JUST DID SOMETHING HILARIOUS. NOW YOU LAUGH 
AT ME. DO IT ! 
  
[ Laughing Continues ] 

[ Romy ]  
GOD, THAT WAS SO RUDE. I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T HELP IT IF YOU HAD 
SCOLIOSIS. 

[ Michele ]  
I KNOW.   AND WHAT A BITCH, TAKING YOUR HAMBURGER. I MEAN, WHAT 
WAS THAT ? 
  
[ Gasps ] 
  GOD, REMEMBER THE PROM ? 
  YOU GOT SO THIN BY THEN. 

[ Romy ] 
 OH, I KNOW.  I WAS SO LUCKY GETTING MONO. THAT WAS, LIKE, THE 
BEST DIET EVER. 
  
[ Sighs ] 

[ Michele ]  
I WONDER IF I'D GOTTEN MY BRACE OFF SOONER IF SOMEBODY WOULD'VE 
INVITED ME. 
I MEAN, OTHER THAN SANDY FRINK. 

[ Romy ] 
WELL, NOBODY INVITED ME EITHER. 

[ Michele ]  
WELL, AT LEAST WE LOOKED FANTASTIC, AND THAT IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING. 

[ Christie ]  
OH, GEE.  NICE OUTFITS. 
REALLY. 
    
[ Giggling ] 
LOOK, IT'S THE MADONNA TWINS. 
     
[ Laughing Continues ] 

[ Michele ] 
THIS IS SO TYPICAL. 
OF COURSE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE GOING TO 
A HOE-DOWN. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, I KNOW.  THIS TOWN IS, LIKE, SO UNHIP. 
ECCHH. 
I CAN'T WAIT  'TIL WE MOVE TO L.A. 

[ Michele ]

[ Romy ]
EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN FOR US THERE, MICHELE, AND WE'LL NEVER

[ Applause Continues and ends ] 

[ Romy ]  
DO YOU THINK, SINCE THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT OF SCHOOL AND I MIGHT 
NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN, THAT MAYBE HE WOULD DANCE WITH ME ? 

[ Michele ]
I BET HE WOULD. I MEAN, IT'S SENIOR PROM.  NOBODY'S GONNA SAY 
"NO" TO ANYONE TONIGHT. 
   
[ "Addicted to Love" plays ] 

[ Sandy ]  
MICHELE,  SINCE THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT OF SCHOOL AND ALL, WOULD 
YOU CARE TO DANCE WITH ME ONCE ? 

[ Michele ]  
NO. 
  
[ Scoffs ] 

[ Heather ]  
I'LL DANCE WITH YOU ! 

[ Sandy ]  
NAH. IT'S NO FUN UNLESS YOU REALLY LOVE THE PERSON. THANKS 
ANYWAY. 

[ Toby ]
OKAY, WHO CAN NAME THE CAPITALS OF ALL THE 50 STATES ? 

[ Heather ]
OKAY, TOBY.

OKAY. 

[ Billy ]
HEY, CHRISTIE. THAT ROMY GIRL JUST ASKED ME TO DANCE WITH HER. 
 
[ Christie ]
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.  OH, THAT'S PATHETIC. 
 
[ Billy ]
W-W-W-WHAT SHOULD I DO ? 
   
[ Song Changes to "Whip It" ] 

[ Christie ]  
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS. 

[ Romy ]  
MICHELE ! 

[ Michele ]  

[ Gasps ]  
OH, GOD ! 
OKAY, SO WHAT DID HE SAY ? 

[ Romy ]  
"SURE.  WHY NOT ?"

THANKS A LOT, ROMY. 
  
[ Romy ]
WHAT ? 
  
[ Christie ]
THANKS FOR STEALING  MY BOYFRIEND. 

[ Romy ]
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? 


[ Christie ]
BILLY JUST BROKE UP WITH ME. APPARENTLY HE'S HAD A CRUSH ON YOU 
SINCE MR. ROSWELL'S CLASS. NOW THAT HE KNOWS YOU LIKE HIM, HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO "PRETEND" WITH ME ANYMORE. MY LIFE WAS PERFECT 
AND YOU RUINED IT. 
  
[ Sobs, Squeals ] 

[ Romy ]  
I SWEAR TO GOD, CHRISTIE, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK HE'D DANCE WITH ME. 
 
[ Michele ]
WOW.   
SHE IS REALLY P.O.'D. 
THIS IS SO COOL ! 

[ Romy ] 
I KNOW !   
YOU KNOW WHAT IS SO WEIRD ? I HAD THIS DREAM WHERE, LIKE, BILLY 
WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.  HE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR, BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S 
COMING TRUE OR SOMETHING ! 

[ Michele ]  
UH-HUH. 

[ Romy ]
HOW'S MY HAIR ?  

[ Michele ]
PERFECT.  ROMY, YOU LOOK SO GOOD WITH BLONDE HAIR AND BLACK 
ROOTS. 
IT'S, LIKE, NOT EVEN FUNNY. 

[ Romy ]
I HAVE TO SAY, 
  
[ Motorcycle Engine Revving.  Billy and Christie leave ] 
THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE ONE OF THE VERY BEST NIGHTS OF MY 
ENTIRE LIFE. 
   
[ Song Changes:  Slow Tempo ] 
 
["LYIN' IN MY BED I HEAR THE CLOCK TICK AND THINK OF YOU..." ]  

[ Michele ] 
MAYBE HE'S, LIKE, PASSED OUT IN THE BATHROOM. 
YOU WANT ME TO GO CHECK ? 
   
[ Romy ]
HE'S NOT IN THE BATHROOM, MICHELE. 
    
[ Michele ] 
I'LL DANCE WITH YOU, ROMY. 

[ Romy ]
OKAY. 

[ Michele ]
OKAY. 
 
[ Romy ]
WE JUST WAITED AND WAITED. 
GOD, I WAS SUCH AN IDIOT. 

[ Michele ]  
WAIT 'TIL HE SEES YOU NOW. YOU ARE SO MUCH CUTER THAN YOU WERE IN 
HIGH SCHOOL. 

[ Romy ]
I GUESS I'M CUTER. 

[ Michele ]
YEAH ! 
AND LOOK AT THE WAY WE LIVE--  I MEAN, OUR LIFESTYLE, YOU KNOW. 
WE LIVE IN L.A. AND THEY ARE STILL STUCK IN TUCSON. 

[ Romy ]
YOU KNOW WHAT, MICHELE ? 
YOU'RE RIGHT.  WE ARE GONNA GO BACK THERE AND BLOW THEM AWAY. 

[ Michele ]
BOY, THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO ANSWER. 
WHY DO WE HAVE TO FILL THESE OUT ? 

[ Romy ]
THEY WANNA KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. 

[ Michele ]
OH. 

[ Romy ]
OKAY, HERE WE GO. 

[ Michele ]
AHH ! 

[ Romy ]
"NAME." 

[ Michele ]
OHH, WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN ALREADY ! 

[ Romy ]
OH, I KNOW ! 

[ Michele ]
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS REUNION ! 

[ Romy ]
  
[ Gasps ]  
ME TOO ! 

[ Michele ]

[ Romy ]  
I GUESS SO. 

[ Michele ]  
OKAY. 

[ Romy ]  
YOU KNOW, MICHELE, 

[ Michele ]  
YEAH ? 

[ Romy ]  
NOW THAT I'M LOOKING AT THIS, 

[ Michele ]
UH-HUH ? 

[ Romy ]  
OUR LIVES DON'T SEEM AS IMPRESSIVE AS I THOUGHT. 

[ Michele ]
THEY DON'T ? 

[ Romy ]  
WELL, DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPRESSIVE... THAT WE'RE STILL SINGLE, 
WE'VE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR TEN YEARS, I'M A CASHIER AND 
YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED ? 

[ Michele ]
WELL, NOT SUPER IMPRESSIVE. 

[ Romy ] 
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT OF GOING IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO IMPRESS 
PEOPLE ? 

[ Michele ]
WELL.... OH. 
ROMY, I STILL REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANNA GO. 

[ Romy ]
I KNOW.  ME TOO. 

[ Michele ]
WELL, THEN, CAN'T WE JUST, LIKE, THINK OF SOMETHING ? 

[ Romy ]
OKAY, WELL, THE REUNION IS STILL, LIKE, TWO WEEKS AWAY, RIGHT ? 

[ Michele ]
RIGHT. 

[ Romy ]
AND ALL WE REALLY NEED IS MAYBE, LIKE, BETTER JOBS AND 
BOYFRIENDS.  RIGHT ? 

[ Michele ]
YEAH ! 
BUT, OKAY, IF THOSE THINGS WERE SO EASY TO GET, WOULDN'T WE 
ALREADY HAVE THEM ? 

[ Romy ]
WELL, WE NEVER REALLY TRIED BEFORE. 
WE NEVER REALLY HAD A GOOD REASON, LIKE GOING TO A REUNION, TO 
MOTIVATE US. 

[ Michele ]
 THAT'S TRUE. 

[ Romy ]
OKAY, SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES MORE IMPRESSIVE, 
THAT'S     ALL.  SO I'M GONNA GO BAG US SOME BOYFRIENDS WHILE YOU 
CAN LOOK FOR A COOL NEW JOB. 

[ Michele ]
OKAY. 

[ Romy ]

SOME WEIGHT.

MEANS IF WE WANT TO BURN 4,000 CALORIES, WE ONLY HAVE TO RUN 20 
MILES A DAY. 


[ Michele ]
HEY, ROMY, 'MEMBER MRS. CHIVAS' CLASS ?  THERE WAS, LIKE, ALWAYS

[ Romy ]
THE REUNION'S LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU 
TURNED DOWN A JOB. 

[ Michele ]  
I THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS TO IMPRESS PEOPLE. 
HOW AM I GONNA IMPRESS ANYONE BY SELLING BAN-LON SMOCKS AT 
BARGAIN MART ?

[ Romy ]
JUST FORGET IT. I'M NOT GOING. 

[ Michele ]
WHAT ? 

[ Romy ]
COME ON.  GET REAL, MICHELE.  WE'RE IDIOTS. WE CAN'T GET JOBS AND

[ Shower Running ] 

[ Michele ]
WOW. GOD, THE TOP FEMALE EXECS ARE ALL SO PRETTY. 

[ Romy ]
THOSE AREN'T THE ACTUAL EXECUTIVES, MICHELE. THOSE ARE MODELS. 

[ Michele ]
OH, I THOUGHT THEY LOOKED FAMILIAR.  
GOD, THEY REALLY LOOK LIKE EXECUTIVES, DON'T THEY ? 

[ Romy ]
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WEARING THOSE STUPID SUITS AND PHONY 
GLASSES... 
AND CARRYING BRIEFCASES. 

[ Michele ]  
HUH. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, MY GOD, MICHELE. THAT'S IT ! 
WE CAN GO TO THE REUNION AND JUST PRETEND TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WHO'S 
GONNA KNOW ?  THEY'RE IN TUCSON, WE'RE HERE.  WE COULD JUST SHOW 
UP LOOKING LIKE BUSINESSWOMEN. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, MY GOD ! 
  
[ Laughs ] 
WAIT--  OHH.  IF THE PEOPLE AT THE REUNION SEE US DRIVE UP IN A 
NOVA, WON'T THEY KNOW WE'RE NOT REALLY BUSINESSWOMEN ?

WELL, THEN I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T MIND GIVING US A DETAILED 
ACCOUNT... 
OF EXACTLY HOW YOU CONCOCTED THIS MIRACLE GLUE, WOULD YOU ? 


[ Michele ]  
NO...  UM-- 
WELL, ORDINARILY WHEN YOU MAKE GLUE, FIRST YOU NEED TO THERMOSET 
YOUR RESIN... 
AND THEN AFTER IT COOLS YOU MIX IN A, UM, EPOXIDE. WHICH IS JUST 
A FANCY-SCHMANCY NAME...  FOR ANY SIMPLE, OXYGENATED ADHESIVE, 
RIGHT ? BUT THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE-- 
JUST MAYBE-- YOU COULD RAISE THE VISCOSITY... BY ADDING A COMPLEX  
GLUCOSE DERIVATIVE DURING THE EMULSIFICATION PROCESS. 
AND IT TURNS OUT, I WAS RIGHT.

[ Romy ]  
SO, WHERE'S THE REST OF THE "A" GROUP ? 

[ Lisa ]  
OH, THEY'RE AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE. 
WE SORT OF LOST TOUCH OVER THE YEARS. 

[ Romy ]  
WOW.  ISN'T IT WEIRD WHEN YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS WITH YOUR FRIENDS 
ANYMORE ? 
I MEAN, MICHELE AND I JUST FELL OUT OF TOUCH ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO. 

[ Michele ]  
BECAUSE SHE'S SELFISH, AND SHE ALWAYS, LIKE, DEVALUES ME. 
AND I'M SICK OF IT, YOU KNOW ? 
  ...GOD, YOU GUYS ARE EASY TO TALK TO. 

[ Romy ]  
I INVENTED POST-ITS... YOU KNOW, THE YELLOW THINGS WITH THE 
STICKUM ON THE BACK ? 

[ Lisa ]  
YES, I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. 

[ Romy ]  
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO ? 

[ Lisa ]  
I'M AN ASSOCIATE FASHION EDITOR FOR VOGUE. 

[ Romy ]

[ Romy ]  
NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO. 
  
[ Whispers ] 
OKAY, ROMY. 
  
[ Christie ]  
IT WAS SO CUTE.   
MY MOM GAVE US A NEW CAR SEAT FOR THE BABY.  AND WHEN THE BOX 
ARRIVED, LITTLE JAKE LOOKS UP AT ME AND SAYS, "MOMMY, IS THAT THE 
BABY ?" 
  
[ All Giggling ] 
OH, I WISH. 

[ Romy ]  
HEY, EVERYONE.  
AND SO WE MEET AGAIN. 

[ Christie ]  
UH, HI. 
  
[ Gasps ] 
ROMY WHITE.  YOU'RE THE CHUBBY GIRL. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, WELL, I WAS, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. 
SO, WHAT ARE ALL OF YOU UP TO ?  CHRISTIE, IN THE YEARBOOK YOU 
SAID THAT YOU WANTED 
JANE PAULEY'S JOB.   ARE YOU A BIG TV NEWS ANCHORWOMAN NOW ? 

[ Christie ]
OH, NO, I DON'T EVEN WATCH TV ANYMORE. 
MY PRIORITIES HAVE CHANGED SINCE I BECAME A MOMMY. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS IS NUMBER THREE ? 

[ Romy ]
WOW, THREE KIDS. 
GOD, YOU MUST FEEL REALLY TIED DOWN. 

[ Christie ]
NOT AT ALL. 
I FEEL VERY FULFILLED.  BESIDES, BILLY ALWAYS WANTED A BIG 
FAMILY. 

[ Romy ]  
BILLY CHRISTIANSON ? 

[ Christie ]  
MM-HMM. 

[ Romy ]  
YOU MARRIED BILLY CHRISTIANSON ? 

[ Christie ]  
MM-HMM.   FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS NOW. 
BILLY'S IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. 
SO, HOW ABOUT YOU ?  ANY KIDS ? 

[ Romy ]  
OH.  NO. 
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME, YOU KNOW, WHAT WITH RUNNING MY OWN 
BUSINESS AND ALL. 

[ Girl #2 ]

I INVENTED POST-ITS. 

[ Christie ]  
NO, REALLY. 
WHAT DO YOU DO ? 

[ Romy ]  
THAT'S WHAT I DO. 
I INVENTED POST-ITS. 
  
[ All Giggling, Snickering ] 

[ Christie ]  
YOU'RE KIDDING ME. 

[ Romy ]
WELL, I'VE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. 

[ Girl #1 ]
  OH, YOU KNOW WHO THEY SAY HAS MADE A TON OF MONEY ?   SANDY 
FRINK. 

[ Girl #2 ]
  THE FRINK-A-ZOID ? 


[ Girl #2 ]
YEAH.  HE INVENTED SOME SPECIAL KIND OF RUBBER THAT'S USED IN 
EVERY TENNIS SHOE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

[ Romy ]
HEY, IF ANYBODY NEEDS TO MAKE A CALL, I'VE GOT A PHONE. 

[ Heather ]
IS SANDY FRINK HERE ? 

[ Toby ]  
UH, NO. 
UH, YOU CAN'T GO IN WITHOUT A NAME TAG. 

[ Heather ]

[ Toby ]  
HEATHER MOONEY ? 
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE EXACTLY THE SAME. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, MY GOD. 
HEATHER MOONEY IS HERE ? 
THIS OUGHT TO BE SO GOOD. 

[ Girl #1 ]    
OH, GOD, DON'T LOOK NOW...IT'S HEATHER MOONEY. 

[ Romy ]

[ Heather ]  
HELLO, ROMY. 

[ Romy ]
UH--  E--  UH--  YOU--   OH, UH-- 
HEATHER, YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T COMING.

YEAH, WELL, SINCE SANDY AND MICHELE AREN'T MARRIED-- 
WHAT A WASTE OF A TANK OF GAS, HUH ? 

[ Romy ]  
OKAY, WELL, COME ON, I'LL HELP YOU GO FIND HIM. 

[ Heather ]  
UH, HE'S NOT HERE.  I ALREADY ASKED TOBY DUMBFUCK. 
OBVIOUSLY, I'VE INTERRUPTED. 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK TO IGNORING ME LIKE YOU DID IN HIGH 
SCHOOL ? 

[ Christie ] 
NO, YOU CAN STAY. 
WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING OUR CLASS SUCCESS STORIES. 
SO, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO ? 

[ Heather ]  
EVER HEAR OF LADY FAIR CIGARETTES ?  
I INVENTED THE QUICK-BURNING PAPER. 

[ Girl #2 ]    
WOW, WE HAVE A WHOLE CLASS FULL OF INVENTORS. 

[ Heather ]
MEANING ? 

[ Romy ]  
OH, YOU KNOW, SANDY FRINK INVENTED SOMETHING TOO. 
HEY, ISN'T THAT SANDY OVER THERE NOW ? 

[ Heather ]  
WHAT DID SANDY INVENT ? 

[ Girl #1 ]    
SOME KIND OF RUBBER. 


[ Christie ]  
ROMY HERE INVENTED POST-ITS. 

[ Heather ]  
YOU DID NOT. 

[ Romy ]  
YEAH, I DID. 

[ Heather ]  
YOU DID NOT... YOU DID NOT. 

[ Romy ] 
YEAH, I DID.  YEAH, I-- WELL, WHO DID THEN ? 

[ Heather ]  
A GUY NAMED ART FRY FROM THE 3M CORP. 
WE STUDIED IT IN BUSINESS SCHOOL. 

[ Christie ]  
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.  YOU JUST MADE ALL THAT UP ? 
  
[ All Giggling ] 
  
[ Giggling Continues ] 

[ Girl #1 ]    
OH, GOD, YOU ARE SO WEIRD. 

[ Michele ]  
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE HER ALONE ? 

[ Romy ]  
MICHELE. 

[ Christie ]  
OH, IT'S THE BACK BRACE GIRL. 

[ all girls ]
HI, BACK BRACE GIRL. 
HI, BACK BRACE GIRL. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, SHUT UP. 
AND WHAT ARE YOU PICKING ON US FOR ANYWAY ? 
WE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO GOT FAT. 

[ Christie ]  
WE'RE PREGNANT, YOU HALF-WIT. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, YEAH, WELL, I HOPE YOUR BABIES LOOK LIKE MONKEYS. 
COME ON, ROMY. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, ROMY. 

[ Romy ]  
OH, PLEASE, GO AWAY.  JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. 
WHY DID I EVEN COME BACK HERE ? 

[ Michele ]  
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ?  THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN TELLING SOME 
DUMB STORY... 
AND HAVING EVERYBODY LAUGH AT YOU. 

[ Romy ] 
LIKE WHAT ? 

[ Michele ]  
LIKE LOSING YOUR BEST FRIEND. 
I HAD THE WORST DREAM, ROMY.  I DREAMT THAT WE WEREN'T FRIENDS 
AND WE WERE REALLY, REALLY OLD. 
BUT I MEAN, WE WERE, LIKE, REALLY, REALLY OLD.   AND-AND WE 
WEREN'T FRIENDS. 
I CAN'T STAND THAT WE'RE MAD AT EACH OTHER. 
OKAY, I'M SORRY I SAID ALL THOSE THINGS.  
YOU'RE AS CUTE AS ME.  YOU ARE.   
AND IN SOME CULTURES,  MAYBE CUTER. 

[ Romy ]  
I'M SORRY TOO. 
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT YOU WEREN'T SMART ENOUGH TO INVENT 
POST-ITS. 

[ Michele ]  
WELL, I MEAN, MAYBE I'M NOT.  ALTHOUGH IN MY DREAM, I DID KNOW 
THE FORMULA FOR GLUE. 
SO, ARE WE FRIENDS AGAIN ? 

[ Romy ]  
WELL, DUH. 
  
[ Chuckling ] 
OKAY. 

[ Michele ]  
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER... THAT WE TOLD, LIKE, 
WHAT, FOUR PEOPLE SOME DUMB LIE.  WHO CARES ? 

[ Christie ]  
HI, EVERYBODY. 
SETTLE DOWN.  HI. 
I'M CHRISTIE MASTERS-CHRISTIANSON. 
  
[ Cooing ] 
  
[ Applause ] 
I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO FORMALLY WELCOME YOU ALL...  
TO SAGEBRUSH HIGH'S TEN-YEAR REUNION. 
   
[ Applause ]
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.  OUR OWN LISA 
LUDER IS HELPING SET THE STYLE FOR THE COUNTRY... AS A FASHION 
EDITOR FOR VOGUE MAGAZINE. 
  
[ Murmuring, Cheering ] 
AND TRAVIS McKINNEY IS IN HIS FIFTH YEAR... AS A MEMBER OF THE 
DALLAS COWBOYS  FOOTBALL TEAM. 
AND... ROMY AND MICHELE CLAIMED... THEY INVENTED POST-ITS. 
  
[ Giggling ] 
  
[ Giggling Continues ] 
  
[ Crowd Murmuring ] 
  
[ Giggling Continues ] 

[ Romy ]  
ALL I EVER WANTED WAS FOR PEOPLE TO THINK... THAT WE WERE BETTER 
THAN WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.  AND NOW WE'RE  JUST A STUPID JOKE, 
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS WERE. 

[ Michele ]  
NO, ROMY. 
CAN I TELL YOU THE TRUTH ?  I NEVER KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T   THAT 
GREAT IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
I MEAN, WE ALWAYS HAD SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.  I THOUGHT HIGH 
SCHOOL WAS A BLAST. 
AND UNTIL YOU TOLD ME THAT OUR LIVES WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH, I 
THOUGHT EVERYTHING 
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL WAS A BLAST. 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK OUT THERE AS OURSELVES... AND JUST HAVE 
FUN LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.   THE HELL WITH EVERYONE ELSE. 

[ Romy ] 
 I DON'T THINK I CAN. 

[ Michele ]  
WELL, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP BEING SUCH A BABY ? 
  
[ Gasps ] 
GOD, I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN, LIKE, CHASING YOU ALL OVER THIS 
REUNION. 
WE HAVE COME ALL THIS WAY.  
NOW WE ARE GOING TO ENJOY OURSELVES WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. 

[ Romy ] 

[ "Venus" plays ] 
GOD, MICHELE, I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS SIDE OF YOUR PERSONALITY 
BEFORE. 
YOU'RE SO BOSSY AND DOMINEERING. 
I LIKE IT. 

[ Michele ] 
 ME TOO. 
 
[ Girl #2 ]
  
[ Gasps ] 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. 

[ Christie ]
WHAT ? 
  
[ Grunts ] 

[ Girl #1 ]    
THEY'RE BA-ACK. 

[ Christie ] 
NICE OUTFITS. 
POST-ITS MUST BE REALLY LUCRATIVE. 
   
[ music Continues ] 

[ Michele ]  
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS ? 

[ Romy ]
OH, YEAH, I AM SO SURE. 
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM, CHRISTIE ? 
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SUCH A NASTY BITCH ? 
  
[ Crowd Gasping, Murmuring ] 
DO YOU GET SOME KIND OF SICK PLEASURE FROM TORTURING OTHER PEOPLE 
? 
I MEAN, YEAH, OKAY, SO MICHELE AND I DID MAKE UP SOME LAME STORY. 
WE ONLY DID IT BECAUSE WE WANTED YOU TO TREAT US LIKE HUMAN 
BEINGS. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FINALLY REALIZED ?   I DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE 
US  'CAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOU.  YOU'RE A BAD PERSON WITH AN UGLY 
HEART, AND WE DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK WHAT YOU THINK. 
  
[ Gasping, Murmuring Continue ] 
COME ON, MICHELE. 

[ Michele ]
OKAY... AND, YEAH. 

[ Christie ] 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. 
THEY'RE AS DELUDED ABOUT THEIR LIVES... AS THEY ARE ABOUT THOSE 
HIDEOUS CLOTHES. 
  
[ Snickering ] 

[ Lisa ]  
ACTUALLY, CHRISTIE, THEY'VE GOT NICE LINES, A FUN, FRISKY USE OF 
COLOR. 
ALL IN ALL, I'D HAVE TO SAY THEY'RE REALLY NOT BAD. 
  
[ Gasping, Murmuring Continues ] 
  
[ Woman ] 
SHE WOULD KNOW. 

[ Christie ]
WELL, WE STILL THINK THEY'RE RIDICULOUS.  DON'T WE, GIRLS ? 

[ Lisa ]  
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET THEM THINK FOR THEMSELVES FOR ONCE ? 

[ Christie ]  
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS... BECAUSE UNLIKE A CERTAIN BALL-BUSTING, 
DRIED-UP CAREER WOMAN I MIGHT MENTION, WE'RE ALL HAPPILY MARRIED. 

[ Lisa ]  
THAT'S RIGHT, CHRISTIE... KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT. 
  
[ Crowd Murmuring ] 

[ Lady ] 
I DO LOVE THOSE OUTFITS. 

[ Other Lady ]  
YEAH, SURE DO. 


[ Romy ]
OH, GREAT.  THANKS. 
MICHELE MADE THEM. 

[ Michele ] 
WELL, I JUST SEWED THEM. 
WE BOTH DESIGNED THEM. 

[ Romy ]  
FIFTY-FIFTY. 

[ Lady ]  
WOW. 

[ Other Lady ] 
YEAH, THAT'S SO COOL. 

[ Romy ]
WELL, IT'S BEEN REALLY TERRIFIC SEEING ALL OF YOU. 
COME ON, MICHELE. 

[ Michele ]  
OH, OKAY, BYE. 

[ Heather ]  
HI.  I AM SORRY THAT I BLEW YOUR BIG LIE FOR YOU. 

[ Romy ]  
HEY, THAT'S OKAY.  IT WAS BETTER THIS WAY ANYWAY. 

[ Heather ]  
IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT ? 
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU GUYS HAD IT MADE IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

[ Michele ]  
US ? 

[ Heather ]  
YES, YOU. 
WITH YOUR LONG HAIR AND YOUR LONG LEGS, WALKING ON YOUR LEGS, 
FLIPPING YOUR HAIR. 
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.  YOU MADE SANDY CRAZY.  AND THE WHOLE 
TIME YOU WERE MAKIN' MY LIFE HELL, THE "A" GROUP WAS  MAKING YOUR 
LIFE HELL; I DIDN'T KNOW. 

[ Romy ]  
YOU KNOW WHAT ?  I BET IN HIGH SCHOOL EVERYBODY MADE SOMEBODY'S 
LIFE HELL. 

[ Heather ]  
MM-MMM, NOT ME.  
NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANYONE'S LIFE HELL. 

[ Michele ]  
YOU KNOW WHAT ? 
I BET THAT'S NOT TRUE.  YOU WERE REALLY UNPLEASANT. 

[ Heather ] 
YOU THINK ? 

[ Romy ]  
OH, YEAH. 

[ Toby ]  
HEATHER ? 
...OH, I'M OFF DUTY. 
UM, SINCE YOU NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS 
WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
SIGN MY YEARBOOK.  AND, UH, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME TO FUCK OFF... 
BECAUSE IT REALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS. 

[ Heather ]  
I HURT YOUR FEELINGS ? 

[ Toby ]  
YEAH, ALL THE TIME. 

[ Heather ]  
TREMENDOUS !  THAT'S TREMENDOUS ! 
GO GET YOUR STUPID YEARBOOK.   I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIGN IT. 

[ Toby ]  
OKAY, GREAT. 
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY ? 

[ Romy ]  
MICHELE, I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE. 
THERE IS NO WAY THIS REUNION IS GONNA GET ANY BETTER. 

[ Toby ]  
HEY, EVERYBODY, SANDY FRINK JUST LANDED IN A HELICOPTER ! 

[ Michele ]  
SANDY FRINK HAS A HELICOPTER ? 

[ Romy ]  
YEAH, APPARENTLY, HE'S WORTH, LIKE, MILLIONS. 
HE INVENTED SOME KIND OF SPECIAL RUBBER OR SOMETHING. 

[ Michele ]  
LIKE FOR CONDOMS ? 
   
[ music plays ]
   
[ Heather ]
THAT'S SANDY FRINK ? 
WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING ? 

[ Christie ] 
SANDY, HI. 
YOU LOOK SO RICH...
I MEAN, GREAT. 
 
[ Sandy ] 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, YOU STILL TAKE MY BREATH AWAY. 

[ Michele ]  
THANKS. 
SO YOU MUST BE, LIKE, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PERSON... IN OUR ENTIRE 
GRADUATING CLASS. 

[ Sandy ]
WELL, I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE "SUCCESS." 
IF, TO YOU, SUCCESS MEANS HAVING A HOUSE IN ASPEN, OR IN 
ACAPULCO, 
A PENTHOUSE IN NEW YORK, A MANSION IN MALIBU, A 60-FOOT YACHT, AN 
EIGHT-SEAT WINDSTAR, 
A BELL JET RANGER, A BENTLEY, A PERSONAL TRAINER, A FULL-TIME 
CHEF, A LIVE-IN MASSEUSE 
AND A STAFF OF 24, THEN, YEAH, 
  
[ Chuckles ] 
I GUESS I AM SUCCESSFUL. 
BUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I ACCUMULATE, THERE'S STILL ONE THING I 
JUST DON'T HAVE. 

[ Michele ]  
YOUR OWN COUNTRY ? 

[ Sandy ]  
I DON'T HAVE YOU, MICHELE. 
WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME ? 

[ Michele ]  
ONLY IF ROMY CAN DANCE WITH US. 

[ Sandy ]  
SURE. 
   
[ slow song plays; they dance ]
   "LYING IN MY BED......."  
   
[ Cheering ] 
  
[ Romy ] 
SEE, I TOLD YOU IT WOULD PAY OFF... TO GO TO THOSE CLUBS EVERY 
NIGHT. 

[ Heather ]
OH, COME ON.  OH, JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT ? 


[ Clarence ]
YOU WERE RIGHT.   I WAS A BRAIN-DEAD,  REDNECK ASSHOLE. 
ALTHOUGH I NEVER SCREWED A SHEEP OR MY SISTER. 

[ Heather ]  
WHY NOT ? 
COULDN'T CATCH 'EM ? 

[ Clarence ]
I GUESS I DESERVE THAT. 
I WAS A JERK.  BUT I WAS SO MISERABLE IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
I DON'T THINK I SPOKE MORE THAN TWO WORDS THE ENTIRE TIME. 
I JUST COULDN'T BREATHE THERE, YOU KNOW ? 
PLUS, I HAD THIS REALLY BAD STUTTER. 
LISTEN, YOU, UH, WANNA GO SOMEWHERE QUIET ? 
SOMEWHERE WHERE WE CAN TALK ? 

[ Heather ]  
YOU-YOU WANNA TALK TO ME ? 

[ Clarence ]
YEAH. 

[ Heather ]  
OKAY, COWBOY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TRIP IS, BUT IF THIS IS SOME 
KIND OF A SICK GAME-- 


[ Clarence ]
WHAT ?  NO. 

[ Heather ]
IF YOU FUCK WITH ME IN ANY WAY, I WILL RIP EACH AND EVERY 
APPENDAGE FROM YOUR BODY, 
STARTING WITH YOUR DICK... CAPEESH ? 

[ Clarence ]
LOOK, I J-JUST W-WANTED TO TALK. 

[ Heather ]
OKAY. WHAT THE HELL. 
WHAT IS YOUR NAME ? 

[ Clarence ]  
C-CLARENCE. 

[ Heather ]
I LIKE YOUR HAT, CLARENCE. 

[ Clarence ]
THANK YOU. 

[ Heather ]  
PICK UP THE PACE. 

[ Sandy ]  
YOU WAIT HERE.   I'LL PREP MY CHOPPER. 

[ Michele ]  
OKAY. 

[ Romy ]  
ALL RIGHT. 
  
[ Vomiting ] 
OH, MY GOD, SOMEBODY'S PUKING IN THE BUSHES. 

[ Michele ]  
EEEWWW ! 

[ Sandy ]  
HEY, HOW YOU GUYS DOIN' ? 

[ Romy ]  
BILLY ? 

[ Sandy ]  
CHUBBO ? 


[ Romy ]  
THE NAME IS ROMY. 

[ Sandy ]  
ROMY AND MICHELE. 
SO, WEREN'T YOU GUYS, LIKE, TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH ME IN HIGH 
SCHOOL ? 
  
[ Scoffs ] 

[ Michele ]  
SHE WAS. 

[ Sandy ]  
YOU WANNA GET A ROOM ? 

[ Romy ]  
BUT YOU'RE MARRIED. 

[ Sandy ]  
TO CHRISTIE. 

[ Romy ]  
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN, AND YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL REAL 
ESTATE DEVELOPER. 

[ Sandy ]  
I DO DRYWALL FOR HER OLD MAN'S CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. 
AND YOU KNOW THIS NEW KID ?  DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S MINE. 
  
[ Giggling ] 
SO-- HOW ABOUT THAT ROOM ? 

[ Romy ]  
OKAY...  WHY DON'T YOU GO AND GET THAT ROOM ? 
GO AND WASH YOUR FACE AND TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES, AND I'LL BE 
UP THERE
IN FIVE MINUTES. 

[ Sandy ]  
ALL RIGHT.
