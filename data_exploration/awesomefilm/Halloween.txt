					HALLOWEEN

									FADE IN TO:

	Darkness, with a SMALL SHAPE in the center of the screen. As MAIN
	TITLES CONTINUE OVER, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON the shape.

	We get closer and closer until we see that the shape is a HALLOWEEN
	MASK. It is a large, full-head platex rubber mask, not a monster or
	ghoul, but the pale, NEUTRAL FEATURES OF A MAN weirdly distorted by
	the rubber.

	Finally CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on the eyes of the mask. It is blank,
	empty, a dark, staring socket.  SUPERIMPOSE FINAL CREDIT.

3	EXT./INT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT - SUBJECTIVE POV (PANAGLIDE)

	It is night. We move toward the rear of the house through SOMEONE'S
	POV. CAMERA MOVES UP to a Jack-O-Lantern glowing brightly on a
	windowsill. It is a windy night and the curtains around the Jack-O-
	Lantern ruffle back and forth. Suddenly we hear voices from inside the
	house.

					SISTER (V.O.)
			My parents won't be back till ten.

					BOYFRIEND (V.O.)
			Are you sure?

	Then LAUGHTER.

	The POV moves from the Jack-O-Lantern down to another window and peers
	inside. We see the sister's bedroom through the blowing curtains.

	Into the bedroom comes the SISTER, 18, very pretty. She GIGGLES as the
	BOYFRIEND jumps into the room. Alan, 18, he wears a Halloween mask and
	a costume.

					BOYFRIEND (V.O.; cont'd)
			We're all alone, aren't we?

					SISTER (V.O.)
			Michael's around someplace...

	The boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her.

					SISTER (V.O.; cont'd)
			Take off that thing.

	The boyfriend rips off his mask. He is a handsome young man
	underneath. They kiss again, this time with more passion. The
	boyfriend begins to unbutton the sister's blouse. She responds to him.

	The POV swing away from the window and begins to restlessly pace back
	and forth, agitated, disturbed. We HEAR THE SOUNDS of the sister and
	boyfriend inside the bedroom growing more and more passionate.

	Finally the POV moves back up to the window. Inside through the moving
	curtains, we see the sister and the boyfriend on the bed, naked,
	making love.

	The POV springs back from the window and stalks quickly down the side
	of the house, past the Jack-O-Lantern, around to a door. Quickly the
	door is opened and the POV moves inside.

	The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen, up to a
	drawer. The drawer is opened. A large BUTCHER KNIFE is withdrawn.

	Then the POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door. We look down
	a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend steps out of the bedroom
	door, buttoning his shirt. The sister stands in the doorway, a sheet
	wrapped around her.

					BOYFRIEND
			I gotta go.

					SISTER
			Will you call me tomorrow?

					BOYFRIEND
			Yeah, sure.

					SISTER
			Promise?

					BOYFRIEND
			Yeah.

	They kiss again and the boyfriend walks to the front door. The sister
	watches as he leaves and shuts the door behind him. Then she turns and
	steps back into the bedroom.

	The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door and peers
	around inside. The sister sits at her night-table brushing her hair.
	She is still completely nude.

	Slowly the POV moves into the room. Suddenly we move down to the
	discarded Halloween mask on the floor. The POV bends down and picks it
	up. Then suddenly the POV is covered by the mask and we see through
	the eye-holes.

	The POV moves up behind the sister. Sensing a presence, she spins
	around and stares at the POV, covering her breasts quickly.

					SISTER
			Michael...?

	Suddenly the POV lunges forward. The sister continues to stare
	incredulously. There is a RAPID BLUR as the POV drives the butcher
	knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before we've seen
	it.


	The sister looks down at the blood forming at her hands, then back up
	at the POV with an astonished disbelief.

	Then in a WILD PAROXYSM the butcher knife blurs continuously in and
	out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly. She begins to SCREAM,
	trying to fend off the blows with her hands, then suddenly falls out
	of frame to the floor.

	The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body, spins around
	and careens out of the bedroom.

	At top speed the POV races through the darkened house, to the front
	door, out the door, down the steps and rapidly up the street. The
	CAMERA careens along in frenzied flight, up the sidewalk, up a small
	side alley, down someone's back yard, then to a sudden, abrupt halt in
	front of MOTHER and FATHER just coming out of a neighbor's house.

	Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, then slow,
	growing horror.

					MOTHER
			Michael?

4	CLOSE SHOT - MICHAEL - CRANE

	The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween mask,
	revealing MICHAEL, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy with a calm, quiet
	smile on his face.

	CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his
	hand, then further back. CRANING UP past his parents standing there,
	up from the neighbor's house to a HIGH SHOT of the neighborhood as the
	sounds of POLICE SIRENS rise in the distance.

6	EXT. HIGHWAY - RAIN - NIGHT

	Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain that
	pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station wagon HISSES along
	the wet road surface.

7	INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT

	The baack seat is separated from the front by a wire-mesh screen, much
	like a police car. MARION, 30, drives. She is dressed in a crisp,
	white nurse's uniform. Next to her in the passenger seat is SAM
	LOOMIS, a clinical psychiatrist. He is a tough-looking man in his
	forties who flips through pages in a manila folder.

					LOOMIS
			...then he gets another physical by the
			state, and he makes his apperance before
			the judge. That should take four hours
			if we're lucky, then we're on our way.

					MARION
			What did you use before?

					LOOMIS
			Thorazin.

					MARION
			He'll barely be able to sit up.

					LOOMIS
			That's the idea. Here we are.

8	POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - SANITARIUM

	Through the rain we see a large sign:

				SMITH'S GROVE - WARREN COUNTY
					SANITARIUM

	Behind the sign is the sanitarium itself, a cold-looking building
	surrounded by a fence.

9	INT. STATION WAGON

					LOOMIS (cont'd)
			The driveway's a few hundred yards up
			on your right.

					MARION
			Are there any special instructions?

					LOOMIS
			Just try to understand what we're
			dealing with here. Don't underestimate
			it.

					MARION
			I think we should refer to 'it' as
			'him.'

					LOOMIS
			If you say so.

					MARION
			Your compassion is overwhelming,
			Doctor.

	Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She shoves the
	matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at
	the cigarette pack. The pack of matches reads: "The Rabbit in Red
	Lounge -- Entertainment Nightly." Loomis turns his eyes back to the
	rain-slicked road.

					LOOMIS
			Ever done anything like this before?

					MARION
			Only minimum security.

					LOOMIS
			I see.

					MARION
				(defensively)
			What does that mean?

					LOOMIS
			It means...I see.

					MARION
			You don't have to make this harder
			than it already is.

					LOOMIS
			I couln't if I tried.

					MARION
			The only thin that ever bothers me
			is their jibberish. When they start
			raving on and on...

					LOOMIS
			You don't have anything to worry
			about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15
			years.

	Both of them suddenly stare out the windshield in front of them.

10	POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - FIELD

	Through the rain we see a field off to the side of the road. Dimly lit
	by the car headlights are FIVE PATIENTS, dressed in wind-blown white
	gowns, drenched by the rain, wandering aimlessly around the field.

11	INT. STATION WAGON

					MARION
			Since when do they let them wander
			around?

	They look up ahead.

12	POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - PATIENT

	Standing by the side of the road is a MALE PATIENT, a wild-looking man
	in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who stares at the station
	wagon.

13	INT. STATION WAGON

	Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of the road.
	Loomis jumps out.

14	POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - LOOMIS AND PATIENT

	Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the patient, stand
	and talk for a moment, then hurry back.

15	INT. STATION WAGON

	Loomis climbs back in, dripping from the rain.

					LOOMIS
			Pull up to the entrance!

					MARION
			Shouldn't we pick him up?

					LOOMIS
			Move it!

	Marion starts down the road.

					MARION
			What did he say?

					LOOMIS
			He asked me if I could help him find
			his purple lawnmower.

					MARION
			I don't think this is any time to be
			funny...

					LOOMIS
			He said something else. "It's all
			right now. He's gone. The evil's
			gone."

16	POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SANITARIUM DRIVE

	Ahead of them is the entrance to the sanitarium.

17	INT. STATION WAGON

	Marion slows down to turn.

	Through the rear window we see a SHAPE spring up out of the darkness,
	streak through the rain and LEAP UP ON THE REAR OF THE STATION WAGON.

	The station wagon bounces up and down. The roof sags in and out with
	the weight of SOMEONE ON TOP.

					MARION
			Something fell on the roof.

	The roof continues to buckle in and out wildly.

					LOOMIS
			Something JUMPED on the roof...

	Marion stops and rolls down her window to look outside. Loomis opens
	his door and steps out. Suddenly he is HIT IN THE FACE by a powerful
	fist from the roof. Loomis staggers backwards and falls by the side of
	the road.

	Marion starts the react. SUDDENLY A HAND REACHES IN THROUGH THE WINDOW
	and lunges at her.

	THE FINGERS GRAB HER HAIR. She SCREAMS. The fingers tighten around her
	hair and the hand pulls Marion roughly to the window.

	Twisted around in the seat, Marion's foot jams down all the way on the
	gas pedal. The station wagon ROARS foreward.

	Marion continues to SCREAM, clawing at the hand.

18	POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - ROAD

	Through the rain the road spins crazily ahead, the wipers erasing
	sheets of rain.

	Suddenly the OTHER HAND REACHES DOWN from the roof and grabs the
	wiper, holding it tightly. Rain splashes on the windshield obscuring
	the road.

19	INT. STATION WAGON

	The hand rips at Marion's hair. SCREAMING. Clawing.

20	POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	The windshield is completely obliterated by rain.

21	INT. STATION WAGON

	The station wagon skids and WHAMS into the shoulder on the side of the
	road. Marion is hurled across the seat against the passenger door.

	Suddenly the HAND SPRINGS DOWN FROM ABOVE and SLAMS against the
	passenger window, shattering it.

	SHRIEKING, Marion scurries across the front seat, open's the driver's
	door and scrambles out.

22	EXT. ROAD - STATION WAGON

	Marion frantically crawls her way across the rain-drenched road away
	from the station wagon. CAMERA TRACKS with her as she slides down into
	the muddy shoulder. She looks back.

23	POV - STATION WAGON

	From the shoulder we see the station wagon in the rain, and the SHAPE
	JUMP IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT and SLAM the door.

	Then the station wagon takes off and disappears down the road into the
	darkness.

24	ANGLE ON SHOULDER

	Loomis runs up out of the rain and helps Marion to her feet. She CRIES
	hysterically. Loomis stares off down the road at the disappearing
	tail-lights.

					LOOMIS
			You can calm down. The evil's gone.

26	EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE - DAY

	LAURIE, 17 and pretty in a quiet sort of way, steps out of her two-
	story frame house, down the front walk to the street. Her face has a
	soft, innocent quality, her eyes bright and alive. Her FATHER steps
	out of the door behind her and walks to the car in the driveway. His
	car has "STRODE REAL ESTATE" emblazoned on the side door.

					FATHER
			Don't forget to drop off the keys
			at the Myers place...

					LAURIE
			I won't.

					FATHER
			They're coming by to see the house
			at 10:30. Be sure you leave it
			under the mat...

					LAURIE
			I promise.

27	TRACKING SHOT - LAURIE

	CAMERA MOVES with Laurie as she walks down the residential street. She
	carries a large bundle of school books in her arms. Across a backyard
	TOMMY DOYLE, an eight-year-old boy with tossled brown hair and bright
	blue eyes comes running with his books.

					TOMMY
			Hey, Laurie...

					LAURIE
			Hi, Tommy.

	He catches up with her and they walk along down the street.

					TOMMY
			Are you coming over tonight?

					LAURIE
			Same time, same place.

					TOMMY
			Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?

					LAURIE
			Sure.

					TOMMY
			Can we watch the monster movies?

					LAURIE
			Sure.

					TOMMY
			Will you read to me? Can we make
			popcorn?

					LAURIE
			Sure. Sure.

	They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house set back
	from the street. It is now weather-beaten and dilapidated. Laurie
	walks through the front gate and starts up toward the porch.

					TOMMY
			You're not supposed to go in there.

	Laurie holds up a key.

					LAURIE
			Yes, I am.

					TOMMY
			Uh-uh. That's a spook house.

					LAURIE
			Just watch.

	Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts the
	welcome mat and places the key under it.

28	INT. MYERS HOUSE - THROUGH WINDOW

	Through a frost window, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat.
	Suddenly a DARK SHAPE, THE OUTLINE OF A MAN, leans forward, watching
	her. As she walks back to Tommy at the street THE SHAPE MOVES TO WATCH
	THEM, then fades back into the interior of the house.

29	TRACKING SHOT - LAURIE AND TOMMY

	Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street.

					TOMMY
			Lonnie Elam said never to go up
			there. Lonnie Elam said that's a
			haunted house. He said real awful
			stuff happened there once.

					LAURIE
			Lonnie Elam probably won't get out
			of the sixth grade.

	Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street.

					TOMMY
			I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.

					LAURIE
			See you.

	Laurie continues walking alone. She begins to sing quietly to herself.

					LAURIE
				(sings)
			I wish I had you all alone...
			Just the two of us...
			I would hold you close to me...
			So close to me...

30	ANGLE DOWN STREET

	We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance. CLOSE TO
	CAMERA the DARK SHAPE MOVES INTO FRAME, watching Laurie disappear
	around the corner.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
				(sings)
			Just the two of us...
			So close to me...

31	EXT. SANITARIUM - DAY

	Sam Loomis strides quickly out of the front of the sanitarium followed
	immediately by DR. WYNN, a gray-haired man in his fifties. CAMERA
	TRACKS with them across the parking lot.

					WYNN
			I'm not responsible, Sam.

					LOOMIS
				(angrily)
			Of course not.

					WYNN
			I've given them his profile.

					LOOMIS
			You must have told them we shocked
			him into a grinning idiot. Two
			roadblocks and an all-points bulletin
			wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

	Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it.

					WYNN
			He was your patient, Doctor. If the
			precautions weren't sufficient, you
			should have notified...

					LOOMIS
			I notified everybody! Nobody
			listened.

					WYNN
			There's nothing else I can do.

					LOOMIS
			You can get back on the telephone and
			tell them exactly what walked out of
			here last night. And tell them where
			he's going.

					WYNN
			PROBABLY going.

					LOOMIS
			I'm wasting time.

	Loomis gets in the car. Wynn leans down to the window.

					WYNN
			Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and
			fifty miles from here. How could he
			get there? He can't drive.

					LOOMIS
			He was doing all right last night.
			Maybe somebody around here gave him
			lessons.

	Loomis starts up the car and pull away from the sanitarium. Wynn
	watches him go, then hurries back into the building.

									CUT TO:

32	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

	Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. CAMERA
	MOVES IN on her as a TEACHER drones away at the front of the room.

					TEACHER (v.o.)
			...and the book ends, but what
			Samuels is really talking about here
			is fate.

	CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE-UP of Laurie. She barely listens to the
	teacher as she doodles in her notebook in front of her.

					TEACHER (v.o.; cont'd)
			You see, fate caught up with several
			lives here. No matter what course of
			action Rollins took, he was destined
			to his own fate, his own day of
			reckoning with himself. The idea is
			that destiny is a very real, concrete
			thing that every person has to deal
			with.

	Laurie lets her gaze move to a window. She stares dreamily outside.

33	LAURIE'S POV - STREET

	From the window she can see the street, and a station wagon parked
	along the sidewalk.

	Behind the station wagon stands THE SHAPE OF A MAN. We can't quite see
	his features from here, but it is clear that he is looking in the
	school window.

34	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She turns away from the window and begins to doodle again.

35	ANGLE ON NOTEBOOK

	We see Laurie draw:

					LAURIE STRODE

					TEACHER (v.o.; cont'd)
			Edwin, how does Samuels' view of fate
			differ from that of Costaine?

36	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She glance up from the book and out the window again.

37	LAURIE'S POV - STREET

	The shape behind the station wagon is still there and STARING RIGHT AT
	HER.

38	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She frowns, staring back at the shape.

					EDWIN (v.o.)
			Uh...doesn't he feel that no matter
			how complicated something is, it's
			also really simple, too?

					TEACHER (v.o.)
			No.
				(pause)
			Laurie.

	This springs her around from the window.

					LAURIE
			M'am?

					TEACHER (v.o.)
			Answer the question.

					LAURIE
			Costaine wrote that fate was somehow
			related only to religion, where
			Samuels felt that fate was like a
			natural element, like earth, air,
			fire, and water.

					TEACHER (v.o.)
			That's right, Samuels definitely
			personified fate...

	Laurie sneaks a glance back to the window.

39	LAURIE'S POV - STREET

	The shape and the station wagon are GONE.

40	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She turns back from the window and back to her notebook.

41	ANGLE ON NOTEBOOK

	She has written:

				LAURIE STRODE IS LONELY.

41A	EXT. GAS STATION - HIGHWAY - DAY

	We see a car parked in front of a small, closed-down gas station/diner
	by the side of the highway. CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS over to a phone
	booth. Loomis is inside on the telephone.

					LOOMIS
				(into the telephone)
			No, not since Thursday.
				(pause)
			Yes, yes, I'm all right...Stop
			worrying. After this I'll sleep for
			a week, two weeks...
				(pause)
			I said I'm all right...Believe me.
			I'll be home soon. Yes, I do. Very
			much. I just...have to stop him.
				(pause)
			Of course it's possible, but I know
			him. And when he gets there, God help
			us.
				(pause)
			Right, right, I'll call you. Me too.
			Goodbye.

	Loomis hangs up the phone and steps out of the booth. He looks up the
	highway.

41B	LOOMIS' POV - HIGHWAY

	The highway disappears off into the distance. There is an old
	weatherbeaten sign that reads:

				HADDONFIELD 73 MILES

	Just above the horizon huge clusters of clouds, dark and ominous, are
	blown along by the wind.

41C	EXT. GAS STATION

	Loomis turns and walks back to his car. He glances at the old gas
	station as he walks.

41D	LOOMIS' POV - GAS STATION - MOVING SHOT

	The building is dark, empty, dilapidated. On the padlocked door are
	HUGE MARKS like the clawing of an animal wanting to get in.

41E	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	Loomis stops, stares at the door and then slowly walks over to it. He
	touches the marks with his hands, then looks at the dirt driveway
	around the building.

41F	LOOMIS' POV - DRIVEWAY

	There are definite TIRE TRACKS leading from the highway up to the
	door, then back to the highway again.

	Then his gaze returns to a discarded object crushed in the dirt of the
	driveway: A PACK OF CIGARETTES.

41G	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He picks up the cigarette pack.

41H	CLOSE SHOT - CIGARETTE PACK

	Stuck in the cellophane of the crushed pack are matches: "The Rabbit
	in Red Lounge -- Entertainment Nightly."

41J	EXT. GAS STATION

	Loomis turns and quickly strides back to his car, gets in and roars
	away from the lonely gas station.

									CUT TO:

42	EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

	The playground is filled with CHILDREN just getting out of school for
	the day. Some are dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, some carry pumkins
	and orange and black streamers, some carry Jack-O-Lanterns.

	Tommy Doyle comes out of the door carrying a very large pumkin. He is
	followed by three BOYS, RICHIE, KEITH, and LONNIE, who are laughing
	and PUSHING him.

					TOMMY
			Leave me alone!

					LONNIE
			He's gonna get you!

	Lonnie runs up to Tommy and wiggles his fingers in Tommy's face. The
	other boys form a circle around Tommy and taunt him. In unison they
	sing:

					BOYS
			He's gonna get you, he's gonna get
			you...

					LONNIE
			The boogeyman is coming!

					TOMMY
			No, he's not. Leave me alone.

					LONNIE
			He doesn't believe us. Don't you know
			what happens on Halloween?

					TOMMY
			Yeah, we get candy.

	The boys LAUGH. Richie runs up to Tommy and makes a face.

					RICHIE
			Oooooo! The boogey man!

	The other boys join in the chant.

					BOYS
				(in unison)
			The boogey man, the boogey man, the
			boogey man...

	Tommy turns from them and starts to run away. Richie sticks out his
	foot. Tommy trips and falls to the concrete, SMASHING his pumkin
	beneath him. The other boys run away GIGGLING and SCREAMING with
	delight.

43	PLAYGROUND ENTRANCE - GATE

	As the boys race out of the playground, Richie barrels through the
	gate and RUNS RIGHT INTO THE DARK SHAPE.

	We don't see the shape's face, just his lower body. He is dressed in
	pants and a shirt that look too big for him. He grabs Richie and holds
	him back at arms length.

	A large OBJECT falls out of his pocket. Richie quickly stares down at
	it. The shape lifts his foot and SMACKS it down over the object to
	hide it. Quickly, Richie and the other boys run around the man and on
	down the block.

	The shape lifts his foot. Underneath it is a LARGE BUTCHER KNIFE. He
	quickly picks it up and shoves it into his pocket.

	Slowly, the shape turns and walks away from the playground gate,
	CAMERA TRACKING WITH HIM. Across from him in the playground we see
	Tommy get to his feet, wiping the demolished pumking off his shirt and
	pants.

	We TRACK WITH the shape to a station wagon. On the side of the door is
	a STATE EMBLEM.

44	INT. STATION WAGON

	The shape gets in the station wagon. We still don't see his face.
	Separating the front and back seats is the wire-mesh screen. It is
	Loomis' vehicle. The shape starts the engine. He pulls away from the
	curb.

45	POV FROM WINDOW

	Slowly, the station wagon moves down the street. We see Tommy hurrying
	along the sidewalk, still rubbing off the pumkin splatter. Tommy turns
	off the side walk and cuts up a side alley.

	The wagon picks up speed and continues on down the street.

46	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	Laurie and LYNDA stroll down the front steps of the high school and
	turn up the street. Laurie carries another large stack of books. Lynda
	is a knockout in tight jeans and tight T-shirt. She carries no books.
	CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM up the street.

					LYNDA
			It's totally insane! We have three
			new cheers to learn in the morning,
			the game in the afternoon, I get my
			hair done at five, and the dance is
			at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!

					LAURIE
			I think you have too much to do
			tomorrow.

					LYNDA
			TOTALLY!

					LAURIE
			As usual, I don't have anything to
			do.

					LYNDA
			It's your own fault and I don't feel
			sorry for you.

	ANNIE comes out of the side doors of the high school and calls after
	Laurie and Lynda.

					ANNIE
			Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

	The girls stop and wait for Annie.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Why didn't you wait for me?

					LYNDA
			We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally
			never showed up.

					ANNIE
			That's not true. Here I am.

					LAURIE
			What's wrong, Annie? You're not
			smiling.

					ANNIE
			I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged
			me into the boys' locker room to tell
			me...

					LAURIE
			Exploring uncharted territory?

					LYNDA
			It's been totally charted.

					ANNIE
			We just talked.

					LYNDA
			Sure.

					ANNIE
			Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
			and soaping windows. His parents
			grounded him for the weekend. He
			can't come over tonight.

					LAURIE
			I thought you were babysitting
			tonight.

					LYNDA
			The only reason she babysits is to
			have a place to...

	Laurie suddenly stops and looks back toward the school.

					LAURIE
			Shit!

					ANNIE
				(indignant)
			I have a place for that.

					LAURIE
			I forgot my chemistry book.

					LYNDA
			Who cares? I ALWAYS forget my
			chemistry book.

	Laurie glances down the street.

47	LAURIE'S POV - STATION WAGON

	The station wagon slowly moves up the street toward them. The shape
	isn't visible behind the windshield.

48	ANGLE ON GIRLS

					LYNDA
			Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.

					LAURIE
			I don't think so...

	Laurie stares at the station wagon as it moves past. She looks
	directly at the shape inside. There is a quick glimpse of him, a
	strange pale face staring back.

49	INT. STATION WAGON

	The shape is close to CAMERA, out of focus. Out the window we see the
	three girls on the sidewalk.

	The shape stares at Laurie looking back at him, then tromps on the
	accelerator. The wagon whizzes past them.

50	ANGEL ON GIRLS

					ANNIE
				(yells after the car)
			Speed kills!

51	POV - STATION WAGON

	Up the street the wagon suddenly stops. It sits there, waiting.

52	ANGLE ON GIRLS

					ANNIE
				(softer now)
			Can't you take a joke?

53	POV - STATION WAGON

	For a moment the station wagon just sits there. Then it takes off down
	the street and disappears around a corner.

54	ANGLE ON GIRLS

					LAURIE
			Annie, some day you're going to get
			us all in deep trouble.

					LYNDA
			Totally.

					ANNIE
			I hate a guy with a car and no
			sense of humor.

	The girls start walking again. Laurie is quiet, puzzled by the
	appearance of the man in the car.

					LYNDA
			Well, are we still on for tonight?

					ANNIE
				(coldly)
			I wouldn't want to get you in deep
			trouble, Lynda.

					LYNDA
			Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been
			planning on it all week.

					ANNIE
			All right. The Wallaces leave at
			seven.

					LAURIE
				(excited)
			I'M baby sitting for the Doyles.
			It's only three houses away. We can
			keep each other company.

					ANNIE
			Terrific. I've got three choices.
			Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
			screw, or talk to you.

									CUT TO:

55	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

	The three girls stop in front of Lynda's house, a modest suburban home
	on a quiet, tree-lined street.

					ANNIE
			What time?

					LYNDA
			I don't know yet. I have to get out
			of taking my stupid brother trick-
			or-treating.

					ANNIE
			Saving the treats for Bob?

					LYNDA
			Fun-ny. See you.

	Lynda strolls up to her house. Annie and Laurie start down the street.
	CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT of Laurie's face. She stares ahead
	along the sidewalk.

56	LAURIE'S POV - MOVING SHOT - BUSHES

	Up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street. There,
	partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, IS THE SHAPE OF A MAN,
	watching them. He is barely visible, almost blending in with the dark
	foliage.

57	ANGLE ON LAURIE - ANNIE

					LAURIE
			Look.

					ANNIE
			Look where?

					LAURIE
			Behind that bush there.

	Annie looks

58	POV - MOVING SHOT - BUSHES

	The shape is gone. Just bushes.

59	ANGLE ON LAURIE - ANNIE

					ANNIE
			I don't see anything.

					LAURIE
			That man who drove by so fast, the
			one you yelled at.

					ANNIE
			Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!

	Annie walks right over to the bushes and kicks them hard. Nothing
	happens.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Laurie, my dear, he want to talk to
			you.

	Laurie just stands on the sidewalk several feet from the bushes.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			He wants to take you out tonight.

	Slowly Laurie walks over and stares at the bush.

					LAURIE
			He was standing right here.

					ANNIE
			Poor Laurie. You scared another one
			away.

					LAURIE
			Cute.

	They start walking down the sidewalk again.

					ANNIE
			It's tragic. You never go out. You
			must have a small fortune stashed
			from babysitting so much.

					LAURIE
			The guys think I'm too smart.

	Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them.

					ANNIE
			I don't. I think you're whacko.
			You're seeing men behind bushes.

	The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small suburban
	home.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Well, home sweet home. I'll see you
			later.

					LAURIE
			Okay. Bye.

	Annie walks up to her door.

	For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before searching down the
	sidewalk again. CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. A strong wind rises and
	blows hair in front of her face. Again she turns around and glances
	back down the street.

60	LAURIE'S POV - BUSHES

	There is still nothing there.

61	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	Suddenly, Laurie walks RIGHT INTO A MAN standing on the sidewalk in
	front of her. She SCREAMS and drops her books.

	It is LEE BRACKETT, Annie's father. He is a tall man in a county
	sheriff's uniform. He quickly bends down and picks up her books.

					BRACKETT
			I'm sorry, Laurie.

					LAURIE
			Mister Brackett...

					LAURIE
			It's okay...

					BRACKETT
			Well, it's Halloween. I guess
			everybody's entitled to a good
			scare.

					LAURIE
			Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.

	Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie bundles her
	books and hurries up the street.

62	EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE - DAY

	Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house. She pauses a moment
	and glances down the street.

63	LAURIE'S POV - TRICK OR TREATERS

	Several CHILDREN in costumes are going door to door collecting their
	treats.

64	ANGLE ON LAURIE

			Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew

65	INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE - DAY

	Laurie strolls through the living room. Through the doorway into the
	kitchen we see LAURIE'S MOTHER busy making candied apples.

					LAURIE
			Hi, Mom, I'm home.

					LAURIE'S MOTHER
			Laurie, Annie just called. She said
			call her back.

	Laurie turns and hurries up the stairs.

					LAURIE
			Thanks, mom.

66	INT. LAURIE'S ROOM

	Laurie walks into her bedroom. She tosses her books on the bed and
	starts to her telephone.

	The wind blows her curtain through the open window. Laurie crosses to
	the window and leans up to close it.

67	LAURIE'S POV - BACK YARD

	From her room in the second story, Laurie can see into the back yard
	next door. There is a clothesline with sheets blowing in the wind. In
	between the sheets we glimpse THE SHAPE STANDING THERE, looking up at
	Laurie.

68	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She freezes and stares down feafully.

69	LAURIE'S POV - BACK YARD

	The sheets continue to twist and turn in the wind, but now THE SHAPE
	IS GONE.

70	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	Laurie SLAMS the window and locks it. She slowly walks to the middle
	of her room and stands there for several moments, unsure as to whether
	she has actually seen it.

	Suddenly, THE PHONE RINGS, loud and shrill, startling Laurie. She
	answers it.

					LAURIE
			Hello?

	Silence.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Hello?

	There is a SOUND from the reciever, like CHEWING...

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Who is this?

	The chewing continues. She slams the reciever down.

	Almost immediately, the phone RINGS again. Laurie looks at it. It
	rings again. She picks it up.

					LAURIE
			Hello?

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			Why did you hang up on me?

					LAURIE
			Annie, was that you?

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			Of course.

					LAURIE
			Why didn't you say anything? You
			scared me to death.

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			I had my mouth full. Couldn't you
			hear me?

					LAURIE
			I thought it was an obscene phone
			call.

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			Now you hear obscene chewing. You're
			losing it, Laurie.

					LAURIE
			I've already lost it.

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			I doubt that. Listen, my mother is
			letting me use her car. I'll pick you
			up. 6:30.

					LAURIE
			Sure, see you later.

					ANNIE (v.o.)
			Bye.

	Laurie hangs up.

					LAURIE
				(to herself)
			Calm down. This is ridiculous.

71	EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

	WIDE SHOT of an old graveyard on a windy hillside. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN
	as a car pull up on the small road in f.g. Sam Loomis gets out, along
	with TAYLOR, the graveyard owner. Taylor is a small, officious man in
	his late sixties. He glances at a small notepad.

					TAYLOR
			Let's see. Myers. Judith Myers. Row
			18, plot 20. Over this way.

	The two men begin walking along the graveyard, winding arlund
	headstones and flowers.

					TAYLOR (cont'd)
			Every town has something like this
			happen. I remember a guy over in
			Russellville. Charly Bowles. About
			fifteen year ago, he finished dinner,
			excused himself from the table, went
			out into the garage and got a hack
			saw, then came back into the house,
			kissed his wife and two children
			goodbye, and then proceeded to...

					LOOMIS
			Where are we?

					TAYLOR
			Just right over there a ways. And I
			remember Judith Myers. Just couldn't
			believe it. A young boy like that...

	Talyor stops cold.

					LOOMIS
			Lost?

					TAYLOR
				(sadly)
			Why do they do it?

	He points to a plot right in front of them. Loomis stares. THE
	HEADSTONE IS MISSING, uprooted from the ground.

					TAYLOR (cont'd)
			Goddamn kids. They'll do anything
			on Halloween.

					LOOMIS
			Whose grave is it?

	Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots.

					TAYLOR
			18, 20...Judith Myers...

	Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look. Loomis shakes his head and looks
	across the graveyard.

					LOOMIS
			He came home...

72	EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

	CAMERA BEGINS on the trees that line the residential street, twisting
	and writhing in the dusk wind. SLOWLY CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to Laurie
	waiting outside her house by the street. She carries a totebag with
	schoolbooks and knitting needles stuck inside, and a large pumkin. The
	sun is a pale glow behind the trees.

	Laurie turns her gaze down the street.

73	LAURIE'S POV - TRICK OR TREATERS

	More CHILDREN in costumes walk from house to house, some with MOTHERS
	and SISTERS, trick or treating. The wind blows their costumes,
	billowing them outward.

74	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She watches the trick or treater as a car swings around the corner and
	pull up in front of her. It is Annie.

					ANNIE
			Hurry up.

	Laurie walks around the passenger door and gets in.

75	INT. ANNIE'S CAR - DUSK

	Annie pulls away from the curb and hands Laurie a joint.

					ANNIE
			We just have time.

	Laurie lights the joint and puffs vigorously.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			You still spooked?

					LAURIE
			I wasn't spooked.

					ANNIE
			Lies.

					LAURIE
			I saw someone standing in Mr.
			Riddle's back yard.

					ANNIE
			Probably Mister Riddle.

					LAURIE
			He was watching me.

					ANNIE
			Mister Riddle was watching you?
			Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-
			seven.

					LAURIE
			He can still watch.

					ANNIE
			That's probably all he can do.

	Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see LOOMIS' STATION
	WAGON pull out of an alley and follow along.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			What's the pumkin for?

					LAURIE
			I brought it for Tommy. I figured
			making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep
			him occupied.

					ANNIE
			I always said you'd make a fabulous
			girl scout.

					LAURIE
			Thanks.

					ANNIE
			For that matter, I might as well be
			a girl scout tonight. I plan on
			making popcorn and watching Doctor
			Demensia. Six straight hours of

			Wallace won't know what hit her.

78	POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols Hardware
	Store. An ALARM BELL inside the store CLANGS SHRILLY

79	INT. ANNIE'S CAR

	They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing out the
	marijuana smoke. Behind them the station wagon disappears off down a
	side-street.

80	ANGLE ON POLICE CARS

	Annie's car stops at the police cars. Lee Brackett strolls out to the
	car and leans down to the window.

					BRACKETT
			Hi, Annie, Laurie...

					ANNIE
			Hi, Dad. What happened?

					BRACKETT
				(strains to hear
				over the alarm)
			What?

					ANNIE
			What happened?

					BRACKETT
			Someone broke into the hardware
			store. Probably kids.

					ANNIE
			You blame everything on kids.

					BRACKETT
			The only things missing were some
			Halloween masks, rope, a set of
			knives. What does that sound like
			to you?

	Annie turns to Laurie.

					ANNIE
			It's hard growing up with a cynical
			father.

	Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street. We see Loomis talk to
	a COP who points over to Brackett.

					BRACKETT
			You're going to be late at the
			Doyles, Annie.

					ANNIE
				(unable to hear
				over alarm)
			Huh?

	Just as Brackett is about to speak, the alarm shut off.

					BRACKETT
				(shouts)
			You're going to be late!

					ANNIE
				(to Laurie)
			He shouts, too.

	Brackett smiles as Loomis walks up behind him.

					BRACKETT
			Goodbye, girls.

					ANNIE AND LAURIE
			Bye.

	Annie's car pulls away.

					LOOMIS
			Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.

					BRACKETT

			May be a few minutes. I gotta stick

	in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle
	house.

83	ANGLE FROM STATION WAGON

	We are in the front seat of the station wagon. Through the windshield
	we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye and walk up to the
	Doyle house.

	Then Annie's car makes a wide U-turn in the street and starts down the
	other direction. The station wagon pulls forward and follows her.

	Annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a garage. the
	station wagon stops several feet away.

	We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another two-story
	frame house: the Wallaces'.

84	TRACKING SHOT BEHIND SHAPE

	The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to CAMERA so we can't
	see him. He glances down the street. Gusts of wind blow the costumes
	of children going from house to house.

	The shape moves. CAMERA tracks behind him as he walks toward the
	Wallace house.

	The shape stops in front. Through the front room windows we can see
	Annie talking to the WALLACES as they put on their coats.

	The front door opens. CAMERA and shape quickly MOVE BEHIND A TREE to
	hide from sight.

	The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage. Annie and
	LINDSEY WALLACE, a pretty little nine-year-old, stands in the doorway
	framed by the hall light. Out of the garage comes the Wallaces' car.
	It turns and disappears down the street.

	Annie closes the door. The shape steps out from behind the tree and
	stares at the house.

85	ANGLE ON WINDOW

			Every kid in Haddonfield thinks

					LOOMIS
			They may be right.

86A	ANGLE DOWN SIDE OF HOUSE

	Looking down the side of the house we see Loomis and Brackett walk up
	to the front porch. A broken, rusted RAIN GUTTER CLANGS back and
	fourth against the house in the wind.

87	INT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway.
	They glance at each other. Brackett draws his gun and the two men step
	inside.

	It is totally dark in the house. Brackett's flashlight comes on,
	illuminating the two men. As they move through the house CAMERA TRACKS
	with them.

	Suddenly Brackett stops. He trains his flashlight on a SMALL OBJECT in
	the corner of the room.

					LOOMIS
			What is it?

	For a moment Bracket doesn't speak. Then he steps closer to the
	object.

					BRACKETT
			A dog...

	Both men look down off screen at the animal. Brackett bends down to
	it.

					BRACKETT (cont'd)
			Still warm.

	He stands back up and looks at Loomis.

					LOOMIS
			He got hungry.

	Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away.

					BRACKETT
			Come on...A skunk could have
			killed it...

					LOOMIS
			Could have...

	Brackett looks back at the dead animal.

					BRACKETT
			A man wouldn't do that...

					LOOMIS
			He isn't a man.

88	INT. MYERS BEDROOM

	Loomis and Brackett cautiosly step into the bedroom, the same room
	where the murder took place fifteen years ago. The glow from a distant
	street light casts the shadows of blowing trees on the walls.

					LOOMIS
			It happened in here.

	Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting.

					LOOMIS (cont'd)
			She was sitting here when he came
			through the door.

	Loomis turns and glances at the window. He slowly walks toward it.

					LOOMIS (cont'd)
			He must have watched them through
			this window...

88A	LOOMIS' POV - WINDOW

	CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN toward the window.

88B	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	Loomis stops by the window.

					LOOMIS (cont'd)
			Standing just outside, he could
			peer over the sill...

	Blown loose by the wind, the rain gutter suddenly swings down and
	SMASHES through the window with a THUNDERING CRASH of broken glass.

	Loomis jumps back, reaches into his coat pocket and draws a .357
	magnum revolver.

	Brackett stares at him. Loomis sees Brackett's reaction and slowly
	reholsters the revolver.

					LOOMIS
				(looks at Brackett)
			I suppose I do seem a bit sinister
			for a doctor.

					BRACKETT
			Looks like to me you're just plain
			scared.

					LOOMIS
			I am.
				(he glances around
				the bedroom)
			I met his fifteen years ago. I was
			told there was nothing left, no
			conscience, no reason, no
			understanding, in even the most
			rudimentary sense, of life or death
			or right or wrong. I met this six-
			year-old boy with a blank, cold
			emotionless face and the blackest
			of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent
			eight years trying to reach him and
			another seven trying to keep him
			locked away when I realized what
			was living behind that boy's eyes
			was purely and simply...evil.

	Brackett just looks at him a moment.

					BRACKETT
			What do we do?

					LOOMIS
			He was here, earlier tonight, and
			he may be coming back. I'm going to
			wait for him.

					BRACKETT
			I keep thinking I should call the
			radio and TV stations...

					LOOMIS
			If you do they'll be seeing him
			everywhere, on every street corner,
			in every house. Just tell your men
			to shut their mouths and open their
			eyes.

					BRACKETT
			I'll check back in an hour.

	Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a story. Tommy

102	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Annie is startled by the crash. She looks outside the window.

103	POV OUT KITCHEN WINDOW

	A hanging plant swings in the wind. It BUMPS against the side of the
	house.

104	ANGLE ON ANNIE

	She turns from the window and walks out of the kitchen.

104A	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

	The hanging plant continues to WHAP against the house. A HAND suddenly
	stops its motion. The shape leans up close to the kitchen window,
	looking inside.

104B	ANGLE ON DOG

	From the darkness of the back yard Lester springs forward into CAMERA,
	SNARLING and BARKING viciously.

104C	ANGLE ON SHAPE - DOG

	The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog SNAPPING right
	after him.

104D	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Annie listens to the GROWLING of the dog. She turns to Lindsey in the
	living room.

					ANNIE
			Lindsey, Lester's barking again
			and getting on my nerves again.

					LINDSEY (o.s.)
			No, he's not.

	Suddenly the GROWLING sounds ABRUPTLY STOP.

					ANNIE
			Never mind. He found a hot date.

	Annie turns and walks into the living room.

104E	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

	We see the shape's legs a few feet from the house. Next to him are
	LESTER'S LEGS, kicking and struggling a few feet above the ground.

	Off screen, the shape is strangling the dog in mid-air.

	Finally the dog's legs stop moving and DANGLE LIFELESSLY. The shape
	moves away from the house.

									CUT TO:

105	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the Horrorthon on
	TV.

					TOMMY
			What about the Jack-O-Lantern?

					LAURIE
			After the movie.

					TOMMY
			What about the rest of my comic
			books?

					LAURIE
			After the Jack-O-Lantern.

					TOMMY
				(quietly)
			What about the bogyman?

					LAURIE
			There is no such thing.

					TOMMY
			Richie said he was coming after
			me tonight.

					LAURIE
			Do you believe everything that
			Richie tells you?

					TOMMY
			No...

					LAURIE
			Tommy, Halloween night is when
			you play tricks on people and
			scare them. It's all make belive.
			Richie was trying to scare you.

					TOMMY
			I saw the bogyman. I saw him
			outside.

					LAURIE
			There was no one outside.

					TOMMY
			There WAS.

					LAURIE
			What did he look like?

					TOMMY
			The bogyman!

					LAURIE
			We're no getting anywhere. All
			right, look, Tommy. The bogyman
			can only come out on Halloween
			night, right?

					TOMMY
			Right.

					LAURIE
			And I'm here tonight and I won't
			let him get to you.

					TOMMY
			Promise?

					LAURIE
			I promise.

					TOMMY
			Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern
			now?

	Laurie holds out her hand. Tommy takes it and together they walk into
	the kitchen.

106	EXT. PASSAGEWAY TO LAUNDRY - WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

	Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room. She is wearing
	a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed. The wind blows the
	robe open.

107	ANOTHER ANGLE - PASSAGEWAY

	The shape stands behind a tree watching Annie walk along the
	passageway.

108	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

	Annie walks into the dark laundry room.

	Almost immediately the wind BLOWS THE DOOR SHUT!

	Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking for the
	light switch.

					ANNIE
			Terrific!

109	ANGLE ON DOOR

	The door CREAKS open. Behind the door we see the outline of the SHAPE
	STANDING THERE.

110	ANGLE ON ANNIE

	Annie turns toward the slightly open door.

					ANNIE
			Hello?

	Silence.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Who's there?

	Silence. The wind blows the door open a little wider. In the light
	from the main house, Annie sees the light switch. Quickly she flicks
	on the switch and the laundry room lights up. She glances outside the
	door.

	There is no one there.

					ANNIE
			Paul, is this one of your cheap
			tricks?
				(pause; disappointed)
			I guess not.

	She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine. She opens
	the top and dumps her clothes inside.

					ANNIE
			No tricks for Annie tonight.

	Suddenly a big gust of wind comes through the opened window above her.
	The door SLAMS SHUT!

	Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it. It won't open.

111	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	She tries to pull the door open. BEHIND HER, in the open window above
	the washing machine, we see the SHAPE looking in.

					ANNIE
			Lindsey! Lindsey, come out here!

112	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	LINDSEY WALLACE, 8 years old with a pretty face, watches the Horror
	Marathon at top volume on TV. She doesn't hear Annie's call.

113	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

					ANNIE
			Lindsey, I'm in the laundry
			room! The door is stuck!

	Annie turns and glances at the window above the washing machine. THE
	SHAPE IS GONE.

	She quickly crosses to the washing machine, climbs up on top of it and
	starts out the window. Half way through she GETS STUCK. She tries to
	squirm her way back in but it's hopeless.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Lindsey! Lindsey, goddamn it,
			help!

	From the house Annie hears the phone ring.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Lindsey, answer the phone! It's
			Paul! Lindsey! LINDSEY!

114	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Lindsey still sits in front of the TV. She lets the phone ring away.
	Finally she gets up and walks to the phone, her eyes pivoted on the
	TV. She picks up the reciever.

					LINDSEY
			Hello.

					PAUL (v.o.)
			Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is
			Annie there?

					LINDSEY
			Yes, she is.

					PAUL (v.o.)
			Will you get her for me?

					LINDSEY
			She's washing her clothes.

					PAUL (v.o.)
			Well, go tell her it's me, okay?

					LINDSEY
			Okay.

	Lindsey hangs up the phone and walks through the kitchen to the back
	door. She calls from the door.

					LINDSEY
			Annie, Paul's on the phone!

115	ANGLE ON ANNIE HANGING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

					ANNIE
			Lindsey, open the door! I'm
			locked in the laundry room!

116	EXT. LAUNDRY ROOM

	Lindsey crosses to the laundry room door. It is bolted from the
	outside. She lifts the bolt and looks inside the room.

117	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

					LINDSEY
			You locked yourself in.

					ANNIE
			I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.

	Lindsey pulls on Annie's legs and she slides from the window onto the
	dryer.

					ANNIE
			Lindsey, promise you won't tell
			anyone!

118	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	As Annie and Lindsey walk back into the house, the phone rings.
	Lindsey races across the room and picks it up.

					LINDSEY
			She was stuck in the window,
			she'll be right there.

	Lindsey sets down the reciever and walks out of the kitchen. Annie
	gives Lindsey a dirty look and picks it up.

					ANNIE
			Hello, Paul.
				(pause)
			All right, cut it out. It can
			happen to anyone.
				(pause)
			Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in
			OTHER POSITIONS!

	Suddenly behind Annie THE SHAPE WALKS THROUGH THE HALLWAY BETWEEN THE
	LIVING ROOM AND THE KITCHEN. She doesn't see it.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			That's fantastic! When did they
			leave?
				(pause)
			Utterly fabulous! So why don't
			you just walk over? My clothes
			are in the wash. I can't come
			now.
				(pause)
			Shut up, jerk. I've got a robe on.
			That's all you think about.
				(pause)
			That's no true. I think about lots
			of things. Why don't we not stand
			here talking about them and get
			down to doing them? All right, see
			you in a few minutes.

	Annie hangs up the phone. She walks into the living room. Lindsey is
	back watching the TV Horrorthon.

					LINDSEY
				(excitedly)
			I'm scared.

					ANNIE
			Then why are you sitting here with
			half the lights off?

					LINDSEY
			I don't know.

					ANNIE
			Well, come on, get your coat.
			We're going to pick up Paul.

					LINDSEY
			I don't want to.

					ANNIE
			Look, Lindsey, I thought we
			understood each other...

					LINDSEY
			I want to stay here and watch
			this.

	Annie calculates a moment.

					ANNIE
			Okay, if I can fix it so you
			can watch TV with Tommy Doyle,
			would you like that?

	Lindsey's eyes light up.

					LINDSEY
			Yes.

					ANNIE
			Come with me.

									CUT TO:

119	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house. Lindsey carries a
	bowl of popcorn. Annie has a coat over the negligee.

	They walk down the street to the Doyles. The wind blows strong and
	whips the negligee around Annie's legs.

120	ANOTHER ANGLE - STREET

	As the girls make their way down the street. The SHAPE steps into the
	glow of the streetlight and watches them. He pulls a LARGE KNIFE from
	his pocket. The BLADE GLISTENS in the light.

121	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	Laurie and Tommy are covered with pumpkin meat when the doorbell
	rings. Tommy runs to answer it. He opens the door. Annie and Lindsey
	stand there.

					TOMMY
			Hi, come on in. We're making a
			Jack-O-Lantern.

					LINDSEY
			I want to watch TV.

	Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room. She takes off her
	coat; sits in front of the TV and eats her popcorn.

	Laurie comes from the kitchen. She glances at Annie's coat.

					LAURIE
			Fancy.

					ANNIE
			This has not been my night. My
			clothes are in the wash, I
			spilled butter down the front of
			me, I got stuck in a window...

					LAURIE
			I'm glad you're here because I
			have something I want you to do.
			I want you to call up Ben Tramer
			and tell him you were just
			fooling around.

					ANNIE
			I can't.

					LAURIE
			Yes, you can.

					ANNIE
			He went out drinking beer with Mike
			Godfrey and he won't be back until
			late. YOU'LL have to call him
			tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to
			pick up Paul.

	Laurie glances at Lindsey.

					LAURIE
			Wait a minute here...

					ANNIE
			If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER
			talking to Ben Tramer in the
			morning.

					LAURIE
			Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was
			grounded.

					ANNIE
			He was. Old jerko found a way to
			sneak out. Listen, I'll call you
			in an hour or so.

	Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie
	closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the
	Horrorthon.

					LAURIE
			The old girl scout comes through
			again.

122	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

	Annie hurries across the back yard and steps into the garage. She
	walks to her car.

					ANNIE
				(sings to herself)
			Oh, Paul, I give you all...

	She tries the door. It is LOCKED.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			No keys, but please...my Paul.

	Quickly she turns and walks out of the garage.

123	INT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse. She finds
	it in the front room, takes out her brush and lipstick and stands in
	front of the mirror primping.

					ANNIE
				(sings)
			My Paul, I can no longer stall...

	She glances up at her image in the mirror.

					ANNIE (cont'd)
			Lucky thing. Spilled butter on
			her clothes, but nobody will
			know...
				(sings)
			...except for Paul...

	Suddenly the phone RINGS. Quickly Annie grabs it.

					ANNIE
			Hello. Oh, hi, Dad.
				(pause)
			No, just watching TV with
			lindsey.
				(pause)
			Be careful about what?
				(pause)
			Well, if you won't tell me how
			can I be careful?
				(pause)
			Sure, sure I will. Bye, dad.

	She hangs up, grabs her purse and rushes out the door.

124	INT. GARAGE

	Annie walks into the garage, over to her car and opens the door. It is
	now UNLOCKED, but Annie doesn't notice.

125	INT. CAR

	Annie slides in and inserts the key in the ignition. The car starts.
	Annie glances at the car door lock. Suddenly she remembers it was
	locked. She stares at it, puzzled.

	An instant later, A MAN SITS UP IN THE BACK SEAT.

	HE WEARS A HALLOWEEN MASK made of rubber with the grotesqe features of
	a man. He reaches forward and grabs her.

	Annie SCREAMS. She lurches for the door. The man puts one hand over
	her mouth and brings the HUGE BUTCHER KNIFE up to her throat.

126	INT. GARAGE - ANGLE ON CAR

	From outside the car we see the struggle inside. Annie's anguished
	face presses against the steamed window. Her SCREAMS are muffled by
	the closed car.

	Suddenly, the struggle stops.

	Annie's face slides down the car window leaving a track in the wet
	surface. Then slowly the track in the glass steams over again.

									CUT TO:

127	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	Music from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS fills the room. Lindsey and
	Tommy are riveted to the screen.

	Tommy glances at Lindsey and slowly sneaks away from the couch. He
	jumps to a window and ducks behind a curtain.

					TOMMY
				(from behind curtain)
			Lindsey. Lindsey.

	Lindsey turns around and looks for Tommy.

					LINDSEY
			Where are you?

	No answer. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for Tommy.

128	BEHIND CURTAIN

	Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. For a moment, he
	glances out the window.

129	TOMMY'S POV - WALLACE BACK YARD

	The figure of a MAN carries what seems to be a BODY across the
	Wallace's back yard.

130	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring the hell out of
	Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying.

					TOMMY
			There he is, there he is! The
			bogyman!

	Laurie rushes in from the kitchen finding the children in tears.

					LAURIE
			What's wrong?

	Tommy points out the window.

					TOMMY
			I saw him again! He's over at
			Lindsey's house. The bogyman!

	At this, Lindsey begins to CRY even louder. Laurie bends down to
	comfort her.

					LAURIE
			Tommy, stop it! You're scaring
			Lindsey.

					TOMMY
			I saw him...

					LAURIE
			I said, stop it! There is no
			bogyman. There's nothing out
			there. If you don't stop all
			this, I'm turning off the TV and
			you go to bed.

	Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to the couch
	in front of the TV set. Almost instantly, Lindsey stops crying and
	follows him.

					TOMMY
			Nobody believes me.

					LINDSEY
			I believe you, Tommy.

	Lindsey sits up next to Tommy and hugs him.

	Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen.

									CUT TO:

131	EXT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

	The old Myers house looks ominous and forboding silhouetted against
	the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the hedge where Loomis
	sits waiting.

	Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Loomis parts the hedge in
	front of him and stares.

132	LOOMIS' POV - STREET

	Three boys, Keith, Richie and Lonnie (from the playground) creep up to
	the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house. They stare
	fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure.

					LONNIE
			I'm not afraid.

					RICHIE
			Bullshit.

					LONNIE
			I'm not!

					RICHIE
			Then go in.

	For a moment Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through the front
	gate up toward the porch.

133	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure whether he
	should interfere or just watch.

134	LOOMIS' POV - OLD HOUSE - STREET

	Lonnis makes it to the front porch and tentatively steps up to the
	door. He glances back to his friends in the street.

	Loomis' POV moves to the street.

					RICHIE
			Chicken!

					KEITH
			Go on, Lonnie!

	Then Loomis' POV moves back to Lonnie at the front door. The boy turns
	to open the door. He's scared out of his mind.

135	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	Loomis quietly stands up behind the hedge.

					LOOMIS
			Lonnie...

136	LOOMIS' POV - OLD HOUSE

	Lonnie spins around and stares in horror at the talking hedge.

137	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

					LOOMIS
			Get your ass away from there!

138	LOOMIS' POV - OLD HOUSE - STREET

	Moving like the wind, Lonnie barrels off the porch and races back to
	his friends. The boys hurtle off down the street in utter terror.

139	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He watches them race away, smiling to himself.

	Suddenly, TWO HANDS enter frame and grab Loomis' shoulders. Loomis
	jumps and spins around. Standing there is Brackett.

					LOOMIS
			Jesus!

					BRACKETT
			You all right?

					LOOMIS
			Sure...

					BRACKETT
			Nothing's going on. Just kids
			playing pranks, trick or
			treating, partying, getting high
			...I have the feeling you're way
			off on this...

					LOOMIS
			You have the wrong feeling.

					BRACKETT
			You're not coming up with much
			to prove me wrong.

					LOOMIS
			Exactly what do you need?

					BRACKETT
			Well, it's going to take more
			than fancy talk to keep me up
			all night creeping around these
			bushes.

					LOOMIS
			I watched him for fifteen
			years, sitting in a room
			staring at a wall, not seeing
			the wall, seeing past it,
			seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited
			for it, inhumanly patient.
			Hour after hour, day after
			day, waiting for some silent,
			invisible alarm to trigger
			him. Death has arrived in your
			little town, sheriff. You can
			ignore it, or you can help me
			stop it.

					BRACKETT
			More fancy talk...You want to
			know what Haddonfield is?
			Families. Children, all lined
			up in rows, up and down these
			streets. You're telling me
			they're lined up for a
			slaughterhouse.

					LOOMIS
			They could be.

					BRACKETT
			I'll stay out with you tonight,
			Doctor, just on the chance that
			you're right. And if you are
			right, damn you for letting him
			out.

	Brackett turns and walks back to the street. Loomis watches him for
	several moments.

141	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	BOB SIMMS, a good-looking 17-year-old, POPS open a can of beer. Next

			Now...First we'll talk a little,
			then Annie will distract Lindsey
			and we sneak quietly up the

					BOB
			Okay. First I rip your clothes

	Bob grabs Lynda and she starts giggling. The can of beer falls over
	onto the front seat.

					LYNDA
			You idiot!

			Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes

					LYNDA
			Totally...

142	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Bob opens the door and together they fall out onto the ground. Bob
	picks Lynda up and carries her up to the front door.

					LYNDA
			Bob...Put me down. Put me down.
			This is totally silly.

	Lynda squirms in Bob's arms. As he sets her down her foot accidentally
	hits the front door and it swings open. Lynda and Bob both stop.

					LYNDA
			Annie, Annie, we're here!

	Bob and Lynda enter the house.

143	INT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

	The living room is empty. The lights are off. Lynda and Bob enter the
	house and begin turning on the lights.

					BOB
			I wonder where they went.

					LYNDA
			Annie probably took Lindsey out
			or something. Let's look for a
			note.

	Bob walks over to Lynda.

					BOB
			Let's don't.

	They embrace. Bob pulls Lynda over to the couch and turns out the
	light. They kiss. A SHADOW COMES OVER THEM. They continue kissing,
	unaware of the shape of a man on the stairway WATCHING.

144	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is totally black inside. The only sound is the music score
	from "The Thing."

	Suddenly, the sound of laughter is heard from the kitchen. Then an
	orange light floats around the room. As it gets closer, we see that
	Laurie is carrying a Jack-O-Lantern, with a candle illuminating from
	the center of the pumpkin. Behind Laurie is Lyndsey and Tommy making
	scary noises. The procession continues through the house.

					TOMMY
			Ooooooo...He's gonna get you.

					LYNDSEY
			No, he's not.

					LAURIE
			Nobody's going to get anybody.
			Now stop scaring each other.

	The procession continues to the front window. Laurie places the Jack-
	O-Lantern on the window sill. She looks down the street toward the
	Wallaces.

145	LAURIE'S POV OF THE WALLACE HOUSE

	Laurie sees Bob's car parked in front of the house.

					LINDSEY
			Let's make more popcorn.

					LAURIE
			You've had enough. Why don't we
			just sit down and watch the rest

	Laurie sits down on the couch and sighs. Lindsey and Tommy cuddle up
	with her, one on either side.

	The phone rings.

	Laurie gets up to answer it.

					LAURIE
			Hello.

147	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Lynda sits on the couch in the dark. Her hair and clothes are messed
	up. Bob lies on the couch, his head on her lap.

					LYNDA
			Hi, Laurie, what's up?

					LAURIE (v.o.)
			Nothing. I was just sitting down
			for the first time tonight.

					LYNDA
			Is Annie around?

					LAURIE (v.o.)
			No. I thought she'd be home by
			now. She went to pick up Paul.

					LYNDA
			Well, she's totally not here.

					LAURIE (v.o.)
			They probably stopped off
			somewhere. Have her call me
			when she gets back. I've got
			Lyndsey here and I want to
			know what time to put her to
			bed.

					LYNDA
			Okay. Later.

					LAURIE (v.o.)
			Have a good time.

	Lynda hangs up the phone and grins.

					LYNDA
			We sure will.

	Lynda grabs Bob's hand and stands up.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Lindsey is gone for the night.

	Bob grins.

					BOB
			Now that's wonderful.

	Lynda pulls Bob up from the couch and they walk quickly up the stairs.

									CUT TO:

151	INT. WALLACE BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Sounds of lovemaking come from the bed. The only light is a candle
	illuminating the sheets as they move slowly up and down and from side
	to side. Empty beer cans leave a trail from the door to the bed.

	The moans from Lynda begin increasing. They get louder. Building to a
	crescendo. The phone rings. The lovemaking suddenly stops.

					LYNDA
			Shit! Not again.

	Lynda rises up on one arm. The sheets fall away from her, showing a
	very beautifly young body. Her hair is a mess and she is frustrated.
	The phone continues to ring.

					BOB
			I can't help it. It just keeps
			ringing.

					LYNDA
			And I can't keep you interested?

	Bob opens a fresh can of beer. He chugs it down.

					LYNDA
			That's great. Now you'll be too
			drunk to...

					BOB
			Just answer the damn phone.

					LYNDA
			I can't. What if it's the
			Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in
			trouble.

	The phone stops ringing.

					BOB
			Take it off the hook.

	Lynda reaches over and kisses Bob behind the ears. She slowly moves
	around his ear with her tongue. Bob grabs Lynda and pushes her down on
	the bed.

	CAMERA MOVES BACK from the bed as their lovemaking continues, back
	through the bedroom doorway. Standing there in the darkness is THE
	SHAPE watching them.

	Finally, Bob and Lynda climax. Bob rolls off Lynda. She lights a
	cigarette and hands it to Bob, then lights one for herself.

					LYNDA
			Fantastic. Totally.

					BOB
			Yeah.

					LYNDA
			Want a beer?

					BOB
			Yeah.

					LYNDA

			Go get me a beer.

			YEAH?

	Bob gets out of bed and pulls his jeans on. He looks for his glasses.
	He finds them and puts them on.

	Bob leans over and kisses Lynda. He leaves.

	Lynda leans back onto the pillows. She smiles to herself.

152	INT. WALLACE KITCHEN

	Bob comes through the swinging doors. He opens refrigerator and takes
	out two beers. He looks around the kitchen. He opens the cupboards and
	takes out a bag of potato chips. In another cupboard he finds a can of
	peanuts.

	Bob gathers the food and beers into his arms. He shuts the doors.
	WHAM! He steps into a chair, knocking him backwards. The beer falls on
	the floor along with the chips and peanuts.

					BOB
				Goddammit!

153	ANONOTHER ANGLE

	Bob has his head down, intent on cleaning up the mess.

	There is a SLAM from across the kitchen. Bob looks up.

154	BOB'S POV - DOOR

	The back door of the kitchen slowly swings open, as if it has been
	slammed shut and the bolt didn't catch. It squeaks on it's hinges as
	it swings back and forth.

155	INT. KITCHEN

	Slowly, Bob gets to his feet and walks over to the door.

					BOB
			Annie, Paul...

	He steps to the door and looks outside.

156	BOB'S POV - BACK YARD

	The yard is empty. Just the wind blowing the trees.

157	ANGLE ON BOB

	He turns from the door.

	There is a SQUEAK from one of the two closet doors by the kitchen
	counter.

	Bob freezes, staring at the two doors.

					BOB
			Lynda, you asshole!

	He walks to one of the doors and opens it. Nothing inside.

					BOB (cont'd)
			Alright, Lynda, come on out.

	He steps to the other door and opens it.

	RIGHT BEHIND THE DOOR STANDS THE SHAPE wearing the rubber mask. He
	steps out and grabs Bob around the neck with an instantaneous lunge.

	Bob tries to jump away, but the shape has a firm hold on his neck. Bob
	COUGHS and GAGS from the pressure.

	Then the shape LIFTS BOB UP OFF THE FLOOR.

158	ANGLE ON BOB'S FEET

	Bob's feet leave the floor.

159	ANGLE ON BOB'S FACE	

	He makes a gutteral sound deep in his throat as the shape's hand
	closes tightly around his windpipe.

160	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	Behind the mask are two burning eyes. The shape moves forward.

161	ANGLE ON WALL

	Still holding him up with one hand, the shape SLAMS Bob against the
	wall, holding him several feet off the floor. Bob struggles to get
	free.

	The shape lifts his other hand. It holds the butcher knife.

	The shape drives the knife deeply into Bob's chest with a SLAMMING
	THUD, the other end of the knife stuck through the wall.

	Then the shape steps away. Bob hangs there, impaled on the wall, eyes
	still open in horror, dead.

									CUT TO:

162	INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

	Lynda lounges in the bed smoking another cigarette. She hears Bob
	enter the room but doesn't look up.

					LYNDA
			Where's my beer?

	No answer. Lynda turns around and looks.

163	ANOTHER ANGLE - LYNDA'S POV

	The SHAPE STANDS in the doorway. He is covered with A SHEET LIKE A
	GHOST. He WEARS BOB'S GLASSES.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Cute, Bob. Real cute.

	The ghost doesn't answer.

164	ANOTHER ANGLE - LYNDA AND GHOST

	Lynda looks at the ghost. She slides the sheets down from her body.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Come here, you fool.

	The ghost doesn't answer. He continues to stare at Lynda.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Can't I get your ghost, Bob?

	Lynda laughs at her own joke, then stops when she sees the ghost is
	motionless.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			All right, all right. So where's
			the beer?

	Nothing. The ghost just stands there.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Well, answer me! Okay, don't
			answer me. Boy, are you weird!

	Lynda gets out of bed. She is nude and looks beautiful and sensuous in
	the candlelight. She walks over to the phone.

					LYNDA (cont'd)
			Well, I'm gonna call Laurie. I
			wanna know where Annie and Paul
			are. THIS isn't going anywhere.

	Lynda sits down on a chair by the telephone. In the b.g. the ghost
	stands in the doorway. She starts to dial the phone. The ghost starts
	walking toward her.

165	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is very quiet. The kids are asleep. Laurie is sitting on the
	couch knitting. The phone RINGS.

					LAURIE
			Finally.

	Laurie crosses to answer the phone.

166	INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

	Lynda holds the phone to her ear. The ghost walks up slowly behind
	her. He raises his hands to grab her.

167	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Laurie answers the telephone.

					LAURIE
			Hello.

168	INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

	Lynda hears Laurie's hello as THE GHOST GRABS THE PHONE. He clamps one
	hand over Lynda's mouth. She squirms and writhes. He takes the
	telephone cord and wraps it around her neck.

169	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

					LAURIE
			Hello?

	Laurie hears SQUEALS, and rustling sounds across the phone.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			All right, Annie! I've heard
			your famous chewing, now I get
			your famous squeals?

	Laurie continues to hear weird SOUNDS.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Annie?

170	INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

	Lynda tries to fight off the ghost. He wraps the cord around her neck.
	He pulls tight. Lynda reaches up and pulls on the sheet. It slides off
	the man, to reveal the grotesque Halloween mask.

	Lynda gasps and tries to scream. The man pulls the cord tighter. Her
	face turns blue. She opens her mouth, trying to get air, then slowly
	slumps forward and remains motionless. LYNDA IS DEAD.

	The shape picks up the reciever and puts it to his ear.

171	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - ANGLE ON LAURIE

					LAURIE
			Annie, Annie! Are you all
			right?

	Silence over the phone.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Are you fooling around again?

	Silence.

					LAURIE (con't)
			I'll kill you if this is a
			joke!

	More silence.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Annie...

	Suddenly the phone goes dead.

	Laurie stares at the reciever, then hangs up. She crosses to the
	window and looks out toward the Wallace house.

172	LAURIE'S POV - WALLACE HOUSE

	The street is quiet, dark and windy. Bob's car is parked in front of
	the Wallace house.

	SUDDENLY A LIGHT GOES ON IN THE BEDROOM.

173	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She stares at the house, puzzled.

174	LAURIE'S POV - WALLACE HOUSE

	THEN THE LIGHT GOES OFF.

175	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Laurie moves from the window back to the telephone and dials Annie's
	number. We HEAR the phone ringing on the other end.

176	INT. WALLACE HOUSE - BEDROOM

	CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS through the darkened bedroom of the Wallace
	house. There is no sign of a struggle. The room is empty. The phone
	RINGS away.

177	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Laurie finally hangs up the phone. She stands for a moment considering
	it, then turns and walks upstairs.

178	INT. DOYLE BEDROOM

	Laurie opens the door to the bedroom. Tommy and Lindsey are sound
	asleep on the bed. She looks at them a moment, then closes the door
	behind her.

179	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

	Laurie comes back downstairs. She takes a key out of her purse and
	again steps to the window.

180	LAURIE'S POV - WALLACE HOUSE

	Dark and silent.

181	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She steps to the front door.

									CUT TO:

182	EXT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

	Loomis sits in silence behind the hedge watching the Myers house.
	Frustrated, he gets up and walks to the street.

	For a moment he glances back at the Myers house, then starts down the
	quiet residential street.

183	LOOMIS' POV - STREET - STATION WAGON

	It is empty except for a station wagon parked several blocks away.

184	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He turns away from the street. Then a thought strikes him. He looks
	again.

185	LOOMIS' POV - STREET - STATION WAGON

	THE LONE CAR IS LOOMIS' STATION WAGON.

186	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He's not certain of it. Slowly Loomis starts walking down the street
	toward the station wagon.

									CUT TO:

187	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Laurie locks the Doyle house and walks away out into the street. The

	MOVING SHOT toward the Wallace house, dark and ominous.

189	MOVING SHOT - LAURIE

	She moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind. She puts the

190	LAURIE'S POV - WALLACE HOUSE - MOVING SHOT

	A car turns the corner and drives past the Wallace house, casting a
	strange shadowy pattern across the front of the house.

	emblazoned on the side.

									CUT TO:

197	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA MOVES UP to the front of the Wallace house. Laurie walks up to
	the front porch. She stands there a moment, listening, as if to hear
	some sound of life from the inside.

	She KNOCKS on the door and RINGS the doorbell. She waits.

	Silence.

	She steps off the porch and walks around to the side of the house,
	CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. She moves to the garage and peeks inside.
	There is Annie's car.

	Laurie thinks a moment, then looks to the street.

198	LAURIE'S POV - BOB'S CAR

	Bob's car sits there on the street.

199	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house and garage
	around to the back door.

	THE KITCHEN DOOR IS AJAR, swinging back and forth in the wind.

	Laurie pulls open the door and steps into the house.

200	INT. WALLACE KITCHEN

	The kitchen is dark. Laurie stands there a moment staring into the
	blackness.

					LAURIE
			Annie?

	No answer.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Bob, Lynda, Annie?

	No one answers. Laurie searches for the wall light. She flips it and
	nothing happens. She looks again into the darkness.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Hello?

	Nothing. Laurie moves forward into the house, CAMERA TRACKING WITH
	HER.

	Laurie walks into the living room. She stops to let her eyes get
	accustomed to the almost total darkness. She reaches for a nearby lamp
	and trips over the cord. The lamp CLUNKS to the floor.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Shit.

	SUDDENLY THERE IS A CRASHING SOUND FROM UPSTAIRS.

	Laurie spins around and stares up the dark staircase.

	Another SQUEAK from above.

	Laurie smiles.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			All right, meatheads. The joke
			is over.

	Silence.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Come on, Annie, enough.

	Another SOUND from upstairs, a DRAGGING across the floor.

	Laurie moves to the head of the staircase. The dragging sound STOPS
	ABRUPTLY. Silence.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			This has most definitely stopped
			being funny. Now cut it out!

	A SCRAPING SOUND, then silence.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			You'll be sorry.

	Slowly Laurie starts up the staircase.

									CUT TO:

201	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Loomis stands by his car glancing up and down the empty street.

206	LAURIE'S POV - DOOR

	She reaches the door. Her hand reaches out and touches it.

	The door swings open.

	A Jack-O-Lantern casts and eerie glow around the room. There is
	SOMEONE lying on the bed but from this position Laurie can't see.

207	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She moves forward toward the bed.

208	LAURIE'S POV

	CAMERA MOVES FORWARD. There on the bed is ANNIE! Her face is a chalky

	AT THE HEAD OF THE BED IS JUDITH MYERS' TOMBSTONE.

209	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She stares at the bed and then SCREAMS at the top of her lungs.

	SUDDENLY SOMETHING DROPS DOWN AT HER FROM ABOVE.

	Laurie jumps back to the door.

	Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling, dangling there in the
	middle of the room, is Bob, eyes open and staring.

211	INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

	Laurie backs out of the bedroom. Her mouth is open in speachless
	horror.

	SUDDENLY A DOOR NEXT TO HER SLOWLY OPENS. There is LYNDA standing
	there, propped up by a chair, staring at her with glazed, dead eyes.

212	ANGLE ON LAURIE - CORNER (LIGHTING EFFECT)

	Laurie shrinks back into a dark corner. She can only stare in horror
	at the sight of her dead friend.

	SUDDENLY WE ARE AWARE OF SOMETHING THERE IN THE DARK CORNER. It is
	almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to adjust to the darkness
	and we see THE OUTLINE OF A MAN standing right behind her.

	The outline becomes more and more clear. It is the shape, wearing the
	mask, the butcher knife in his hand, gleaming, RIGHT BEHIND LAURIE.

	Laurie suddenly moves away from the corner.

	The shape lunges out at her.

213	CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE'S BACK - HAND

	lungs.

217	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	She crawls to the kitchen, rolls inside an SLAMS the kitchen door
	behind her. In a flash, she leaps up and CLICKS the lock.

	There is a POUNDING on the door from the other side.

	Laurie slowly climbs to her feet and limps toward the back door.

	Suddenly, the kitchen door EXPLODES, the middle of it BREAKING APART.
	The shape reaches through, groping for the lock.

236	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	The shape's hand grabs the lock and CLICKS it open.

237	ANGLE ON LAURIE - KITCHEN WINDOW

241	EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

	Laurie picks herself up from the ground and runs as fast as she can,
	limping across the backyard, CAMERA MOVING WITH HER. She passes the
	driveway and scurries into the neighbor's backyard, up to the back

251	LAURIE'S POV - STREET

	The street is empty. The wind WHISHES the trees. Leaves sprinkle down.

252	EXT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Laurie gropes around for the key. It lies over a crack in the wooden
	porch. She reaches for it but her fingers nudge the key between the
	crack, down out of sight.

	Laurie SCREAMS with frustration and glances back at the street.

253	LAURIE'S POV - STREET

	THE SHAPE WALKS SLOWLY DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, RIGHT TOWARD
	HER!

254	ANGLE ON LAURIE

259	INT. DOYLE HOUSE

	Laurie bolts the door from the inside.

					LAURIE

					TOMMY
			I'm scared...

					LAURIE
			DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!

					TOMMY
			It's the bogyman, isn't it?

					LAURIE
			HURRY!

	Tommy turns and runs upstairs CRYING.

	Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it up, dials a
	number and waits.

	Then suddenly she reacts. The PHONE IS DEAD. No dial tone.

	She puts down the phone and stands very still. There is A SLIGHT
	BREEZE BLOWING HER HAIR.

	Slowly Laurie moves around the couch.

260	LAURIE'S POV - KITCHEN

	From the living room we see into the kitchen. THE BACK DOOR IS OPEN.

261	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	plunging the butcher knife.

264	ANGLE ON COUCH

	The blade of the butcher knife THUMPS into the couch.

265	ANGLE ON LAURIE - SHAPE

	Instinctively Laurie raises the knitting needle and drives it home,
	right into the shape's neck!

	The shape springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling his head
	back and forth. Then suddenly he freezes, hands outstretched,
	motionless, and falls into a heap on the floor.

	Laurie sits there.

	The shape doesn't move.

	Laurie begins to cry again, harder and harder.

									CUT TO:

266	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	CAMERA MOVES WITH LOOMIS as he moves along the street.

	Suddenly two headlights hit him and a police car swerves to a stop

					BRACKETT
			Where were you? I went back to

					LOOMIS
			I found the car! He's here!

					BRACKETT
			Where?

					LOOMIS
			Three blocks down. Get in the

	Brackett turns and hurries back to the car.

	Loomis starts up the street again as Brackett pulls off in the other
	direction.

									CUT TO:

267	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	WIDE SHOT of the living room. Laurie is on one side of frame, the
	motionless shape lying behind the couch on the other.

	Slowly Laurie stands up, stares at the shape and then moves to the
	staircase.

	Slowly, painfully, Laurie climbs up the stairs.

268	INT. BEDROOM

	Tommy and Lindsey are huddled in a corner WHIMPERING softly. The door
	opens and Laurie steps in. The two children run to her CRYING. She
	holds them in her arms tightly and nudges the door shut with her foot.

					LAURIE
			It's all right now. Shhh, it's
			all right...

	She takes the children back to the bed and sits down with them.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Now I want you to change your
			clothes, Tommy. We're going to
			take a walk outside.

					TOMMY
			Was it the bogyman?

					LINDSEY
			I'm scared!

					LAURIE
			There's nothing to be scared of
			now. Get changed.

					TOMMY
			Are you sure?

					LAURIE
			Yes.

					TOMMY
			How?

					LAURIE
			I killed him...

					TOMMY
			But you can't kill the bogyman.

	SUDDENLY THE BEDROOM DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Standing there is THE SHAPE,
	the butcher knife raised.

	Both children SCREAM. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom and pulls
	the door shut, leaving herself outside in the bedroom.

					LAURIE
			Lock the door! Lock the door!

	The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the knife
	glistening.

	There is a CLICK as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie leaps away
	from the door and circles around the bed.

	The shape keeps coming.

	Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside.

269	INT. CLOTHES CLOSET

	Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into the small,
	dark interior of the closet.

	Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on them.

270	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the closet. She
	rips off the shirt and begins unhooking it.

271	ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR

272	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire.

273	ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR

274	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight.

275	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, raising the
	knife.

276	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	Holding the hanger with both hands she thrusts it forward with all her
	might.

277	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye.

	He leaps back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye
	with both hands.

278	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it upward.

279	ANGLE ON SHAPE

	The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section, right down to
	the hilt. The shape stumbles backward out of the closet.

280	ANGLE ON LAURIE

	She just sits there in the corner of the closet. There is a THUMP from
	the bedroom, then silence.

	Slowly Laurie crawls around and peeks out of the closet doors.

281	LAURIE'S POV - SHAPE

	The shape lies on the floor by the bed, the butcher knife protruding
	from his stomach.

282	INT. BEDROOM

	Laurie emerges from the closet and carefully crosses the bedroom,
	avoiding the shape's body. She goes to the bathroom door and knocks
	softly.

					LAURIE
			Tommy, it's me. Open the door.

	There is a silence, then the door opens. On the other side are Tommy
	and Lindsey, looking utterly terrified. Laurie bends down and shields
	them from the sight of the shape.

					LAURIE (cont'd)
			Now, I want you to walk to the
			door, down the stairs and right
			out the front door.

					LINDSEY
			You're coming with us...

					LAURIE
			Listen to me. I want you to walk
			down the street to the MacKensie's
			and knock on their door. You tell
			them to call the police and send
			them over here. Do you understand?

					TOMMY
			Laurie, you come with us...

					LAURIE
			No! Do as I say.

	She stands up and carefully guides the children across the bedroom to
	the door and ushers them outside. She watches for a moment as they
	walk down the stairs, then slumps down against the door frame in an
	exhausted heap.

283	EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT

	Tommy and Lindsey run out of the house and down the walk to the
	sidewalk. They rush up the street. As they leave frame we see Loomis
	on the other side of the street.

284	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He watches the children with a puzzled frown.

285	LOOMIS' POV - TOMMY AND LINDSEY

	Shrieking with fear, Tommy and Lindsey run up the sidewalk.

286	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He stares at them for a moment, then moves for the Doyle house.

									CUT TO:

287	INT. DOYLE HOUSE - ANGLE THROUGH BEDROOM DOOR - NIGHT

	We see through the bedroom door. In f.g. sits Laurie, slumped against
	the door frame, staring out at nothing, tears streaming down her face.
	In the b.g. lies the shape.

	Slowly Laurie begins to pull herself together once again. She gets up
	to her knees and begins to pull herself up to her feet.

	Her back is to the shape. As she starts to stand THE SHAPE SITS UP,
	the head turning to Laurie.

288	CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE

	Laurie rises into frame, holding herself erect by grasping the door
	frame.

	BEHIND HER THE SHAPE RISES UP INTO FRAME, quickly, silently.

	Laurie just hangs there on the doorframe. An exhausted, ironic smile
	comes over her face.

					LAURIE
			Well, kiddo. Some Halloween...

	Slowly the shape moves for her, his hands outstretched.

	Just as he is about to grab her, Laurie manages to step out the door.

289	ANGLE IN HALL

	Unaware he is behind her, Laurie limps toward the stairs. Suddenly the
	shape jumps out of the bedroom and grabs her, hands around her neck.

	Laurie SCREAMS. She twists and squirms and claws at him, her fingers
	ripping at his mask. She pulls it off over his face, wriggles out of
	his grip and turns around.

290	CLOSE SHOT - MICHAEL

	The shape, Michael, stares at her with his one eye. He has a dank,
	white face with blond hair. There is something completely unhuman
	about his features, the open mouth, the dark staring eye.

291	ANGLE IN HALL

	Michael lunges at her again.

	Suddenly there is a THUNDERING EXPLOSION and Michael is blown off his
	feet. Laurie falls back against the wall.

292	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	Standing at the top of the stairs is Loomis, gun in his hand. He moves
	forward down the hall.

293	ANGLE IN HALL

	Michael slowly gets up to his feet, still refusing to die. Loomis
	stops and takes aim. BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!

	Michael is hit three times, each bullet throwing him backward further
	down the hall until he hits the window at the end and SMASHES through
	it.

294	EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - UP ANGLE

	Michael falls from the second story right down into CAMERA with a
	CRASH!

295	ANGLE IN HALL

	Loomis rushes to Laurie and bends down beside her. For a moment she
	just cries in his arms, sobbing hysterically.

	Then she looks up at him with a glazed, wild expression.

					LAURIE
			It WAS the bogyman...

	Loomis looks down at her, then up at the shattered window at the end
	of the hall.

					LOOMIS
			As a matter of fact it was.

	He walks slowly down to the window and peers out.

296	LOOMIS' POV - BACK YARD

	He looks down at the spot where Michael shoud be, but there is nothing
	there, just a TRAMPLED PATCH IN THE GRASS.

297	ANGLE ON LOOMIS

	He stares down with growing fear, then looks out from the house.

298	LOOMIS' POV

	The back yard, the neighboring yards, the street, all are empty,
	quiet, dark. There is only the SOUND of the wind swelling in the
	trees.

	Michael is gone.

	FADE TO BLACK.

	ROLL END TITLES.

						THE END
