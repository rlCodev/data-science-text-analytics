     VIEWS OF THE CITY OF Portland Oregon digressing into the seedy 
     areas of the small city.
     
     ARCADES, and yellow storefronts, of PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKSHOPS.
     
     A FEW YOUNG MEN LOITER IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE BOOKSHOPS 
     SOLICITOUSLY AND EYE A CUSTOMER.
     
     WHO ENTERS THE BOOXSHOP.
     
     INSIDE, WE SEE:
     
     Counters displaying COLORFUL COMIC-LIKE plastic covered MAGAZINE 
     and BOOK COVERS with names like HONCHO - BUTCH - JOYBOY. 
     INDICATING A Homoerotic section of the bookshop.
     
     GROUPS OF MEN loiter about the magazine shop flipping through the 
     books and disappearing in and out of curtained doors.
     
     THE COUNTERMAN is on the phone.
     
     Next to him is a particularly interesting YOUNG MAN on the cover 
     of one of the magazines - a bright yellow background, jeans open 
     two buttons on the top, shirtless wearing a black cowboy hat. 
     This character is named SCOTT.
     
     FULL VIEW of the MAGAZINE cover as Scott comes to life - and 
     talks to us.
     
                         SCOTT
               I never thought I could be a real 
               model, you know fashion-shit, 
               cause I'm better at full body 
               stuff It.8 okay so long as the 
               photographer doesn't come on to 
               you and expect something for no 
               pay I'm trying to make a living, 
               you know, and I like to be 
               professional 'Course if the guy

               ass, I do it on the street all the 
               time for cash. And I'll be on the 
               cover of a book. It's when you 
               start doing it for free that you 
               start to grow wings, Right, Mike?
     
     ACROSS THE AISLE ON ANOTHER SHELF IS ANOTHER COVER OF A MAGAZINE, 
     AND ANOTHER YOUNG MAN ON THE COVER STARTS TO MOVE AND SPEAK, 
     ADDRESSING SCOTT.
     
     This character is named MIKE. (MIKE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM 
     SCOTT, MIKE SHOULD BE BLOND AND SCOTT SHOULD BE BROWN HAIRED, 
     ALTHOUGH BOTH POSSESS A CERTAIN PAINFUL DOWN AND OUT HANDSOMENESS 
     OF A STREET HUSTLER.)
     
                         MIKE
               What are you talking about? What 
               wings?
     
                         SCOTT
               Wings, man, you grow Wings and 
               become a FAIRY
     
                         MIKE
               I ain't no fairy.
     
     ANOTHER COVERBOY INTERRUPS MIKE AND SCOTT'S DISCUSSION, BUTTING 
     IN.
     
                         COVERBOY
               He ain't saying you is a fairy; 
               faggot, he's saying that if you go 
               working for free then you has no 
               choice, you turn into a fairy, 
               with wings and all. That's all he 
               mean, dunk.
     
                         MIKE (to Scott)
               Well, nevertheless, what do you 
               care about doing stuff for free or 
               for money, shit You're going to 
               inherit a hunch of money, you 
               might as well do it for free.
     
                         COVERBOY
               Is that right, sweetie?
     
     OTHER COVERBOYS PERK UP AND START FLIRTING WITH SCOTT
     
                         COVERBOY 2
               How much is a bunch of money; 
               honey?
     
                         COVERBOY 3
               What are you doing on the cover of 
               that magazine, slumming?
     
     Scott listens to all of them then looks back at Mike. Mike 
     smiles.
     
                         SCOTT
               (to us)
               Actually, I'm on the street to 
               settle a bet with my goddamned 
               stone-faced old man. I've decided to 
               live away from home for three years. 
               To prove a point. That I can live on 
               my own. And to appreciate the value 
               of a dollar. And Mike is right, 
               there, I am going to inherit money. 
               A lot of money
     
     IdAho
     
     The desert in the daytime.
     
     MIKE enters the frame in front of a blue sky filled with white 
     clouds. He has a Texaco gas station attendant's shirt on with a 
     name tag that reads: BILL (not Mike, his name).
     
     The clouds are puffy against a deep blue sky. The road is red. 
     Purple mountains surround Mike on all sides far in the distance, 
     ten miles away. Mike looks in front of him at a long stretch of 
     road that disappears into the horizon.
     
     Mike looks at his wristwatch on his arm. He times how long it 
     takes to walk ten steps down the road.
     
     Ten seconds. He glances back at a duffel bag. The duffel bag 
     falls over.
     
     Mike looks at the picturesque sights surrounding him. A wind 
     sends a tumbleweed into the air. He takes ten steps back to his 
     duffle bag and checks watch again.
     
     The sun is now setting.
     
                         MIKE
               (to himself)
               You can always tell where you are by 
               the way the road looks. Like I Just 
               know that I been to this place 
               before. I Just know that I been 
               stuck here like this one fuckin' 
               time before, you know that?
     
     ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A JACKRABBIT IS LISTENING TO HIM.
     
                         MIKE
               There ain't no other road on earth 
               that looks like this road. I mean, 
               exactly like this road.  (sniffs) 
               One of a kind. (Sniffs) Like 
               someone's face.  Like a fucked up 
               face...
     
     THE ROAD HAS A DEFINITE FACE. TWO DISTANT CACTUS FOR EYES - A 
     CLOUD SHADOW FOR A MOUTH, MOUNTAINS FOR HAIR.
     
                         MIKE
               Once you see it, even for a 
               second, you remember it, and you 
               better not forget it, you gotta 
               remember people and who they are, 
               right? Friends and enemies. You 
               gotta remember the road and where 
               it is too...
     
     MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES AT THE LITTLE RABBIT LISTENING TO HIS CHAT 
     ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND THE RABBIT RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
     
                         MIKE
               I Just love to scare things... I 
               don't know. It gives me a sense 
               of.... Power.

     Mike thinks about the loneliness of the road.
     
                         MIKE
               This is nowhere. I'll bet that 
               nobody is ever going to drive down 
               this road. I'll be stuck here 
               forever.

     Mike looks at the road stressfully. The road looks back. He looks 
     at the road   his eyes growing heavy. The road looks back...
     
     Mikes yawns.
     
                         MIKE'S VOICE OVER
               I don't know when it was I 
               recognized I had this disease.

     Mike looks like a backwoods character who fits into the terrain. 
     Mike makes strange movements, like he is having a sort of 
     epileptic fit, then yawns like he is very tired, again.
     
                         MIKE'S VOICE OVER
               Sometimes I'll be in one place, 
               and I'll close my eyes...

     MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES. THEN A WHOLE RITUAL OF EVENTS HAPPENS, HIS 
     EYES TURN BACK IN HIS HEAD AND HE BEGINS TO SHAKE ALL OVER. THEN 
     ALL GOES BLACK.
     
                         MIKE'S VOICE OVER
               When I open them again, I'll be in 
               a completely different 
               surrounding.

     When Mike opens his eyes, he is in downtown PORTLAND, OREGON.
     
     A LOUD BUS drives by Mike's view in the city. He is asleep, then 
     wakes enough to see other UNKNOWN KIDS rifling his pockets in a 
     doorway, as Mike sleepily looks
     on.
     
                         SUBTITLES
               It's kind of like time travel. 
               It's kind of good.
     
     MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN, AND WHEN HE OPENS THEM HE IS BACK IN 
     THE COUNTRY. BUT THIS TIME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TERRAIN. LIKE A 
     LONG TIME HAS PASSED. HE IS ALSO WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES.
     
     MIKE CHECKS HIS WATCH AGAIN. He looks happy at the passage of 
     time.
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah. It's kind of good. Passes 
               the time. Unwanted as it is.

     MIKE LEANS AGAINST THE DUFFLE BAG WITH HIM. HE LOOKS INTO THE 
     FIELD next to him. The wind blows a paper cup into the air.
     
     Mike watches the cup tumble in the air, and with a few notes, a 
     GUITAR follows. Then an uprooted cactus.
     
     The paper cup, cactus and guitar lyrically trade places in the 
     air, and are followed by a large barn, which twists and turns, 
     then crashes directly into the middle of the road.
     
     On the, road. Riding in the back of a pickup truck. Mike's shirt 
     ruffles wildly in the wind, traveling at 60 mph.
     
     And the truck disappears into the sun, toward a steep mountain 
     range.
     
     LAS VeGAs
     
     Mike is walking down a LONELY ALLEYWAY in the city. ALL OF A 
     SUDDEN he is surrounded by three BLACK BOYS, who are smiling and 
     joking.
     
                         BLACK 1
               SAY, WHITE BOY, where you goin'?
     
     Black 1 pulls out a knife and waves it at Mike.
     
                         BLACK 1
               What's in the sack. Let's see.
     
     Mike fights with the guy for his sack. The Black cuts Mike's 
     hands with his knife but Mike won't let go.
     
     In terror he watches his hands get cut, but he won't let go. Mike 
     starts to yawns and does the jitters to the Black's amazement and 
     drops to the ground. Scottie, the older boy on the magazine 
     cover, comes to Mike's aid. He pushes the Black boy over, throws 
     some trash cans in their direction.
     
                         BLACK 1
               This gonna be fun. Come on...
     
     Scottie keeps fighting them off.
     
                         SCOTT
               Man, what do you want from us, we 
               haven't got anything.
     
     The Blacks chuckle. Then they stop and slowly walk away from 
     Scott who hovers protectively around Mike's body on the ground.
     
                         BLACK (o.s.)
                Faggot!
     
     We are in the city of Las Vegas in the daytime. (We are aware of 
     this because one character, RAY, is reading the Las Vegas 
     Chronicle.) Mike sleeps, as a shopkeeper washes his windows and 
     three other street kids, Gary, Ray and Scottie, are hanging 
     around on the corner with him.
     
     Gary is hitting a public wastebasket with the end of a stick as a 
     MAN in a MERCEDES BENZ drives by them very slowly, and looks at 
     each one of the boys individually. Gary pauses for a moment and 
     poses.
     
                         RAY
               (to the man in the car) What's up?
     
                         MAN (in German)
               [Entschuldiging, Junge...]
     
     The man in the car speeds off.
     
     INT. CAR DAY.
     
     THE MAN has the look of Rainer Fassbinder and Geraldo Rivera as 
     the same man; is of average build and has a wash of hair gracing 
     his forehead that looks quite foreign. He turns to the right 
     three times, as he is circling his car.
     
     OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR, we see the boys again.
     
     EXT. STREET
     
                         GARY
               What's this guy want, think he 
               wants to party?

                         SCOTT
               He said "Entschuldiging, Junge."
     
                         GARY
               What's that mean? "Suck my dick?" 
               Does he want to suck my dick?
     
                         SCOTT
               It means, "Excuse me, boys."

                         GARY
               How the fuck do you know.

                         SCOTT
               I've studied German, in prep 
               school.
     
                         GARY
               You know, Scottie, I don't know 
               when to believe you.
     
                         SCOTT
               Here he comes again.
     
     THE MAN leans out the window of his car.
     
                         MAN
               HELLO?
     
     Gary leans into the man's car.
     
                         GARY
               Hey, dude.
     
                         MAN
               (speaks with a thick German 
               accent) 
               Excuse me. Can I speak to the young 
               man over there, with the blond hair, 
               ya?
     
                         GARY
               Who, that kid there? You can't 
               talk with him now, he's asleep.
     
                         MAN
               Can you wake him up?
     
                         GARY
               No, you can't wake him... he...... 
               but, what about me? Don't you want 
               to talk with me?

     The man is not interested in talking to Gary. He shakes his head 
     no, bothered by Gary.
     
                         SCOTT
               (speaking fluent German)
               Was willist du in Gottesname mit uns 
               Juenge?  Mach' es flar oder fanre 
               ab!
               (What in the hell do you want with 
               us young kids, be specific or get 
               out.)

                         MAN
               (surprised)
               Du bisst sehr intelligent mit deinem 
               Aksent..  Fuer elnen Puppejunge.
               (You are very clever with an accent 
               like that.. for a street boy.)

     THE MAN IN THE CAR SPEEDS OFF.
     
                         GARY
               Alright then, asshole!
     
     VIEW of Mike's sleeping face.
     
     INSIDE OF MIKE'S thoughts. He is flying over the city streets, 
     above the Mercedes Benz, effortlessly hovering and gilding above 
     it, between the buildings.  Like a bird.
     
     Mike wakes and looks at Scottie, who is talking to
     Gary.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               The first time I met Scott, I had 
               a feeling he was a sort of comic 
               book hero. He was always saying 
               the right thing at the right 
               moment, and standing up for me 
               when there was no reason to. Look 
               at his face now, when the sunlight 
               shines off his lower lip, like it 
               is the face of some sort of 
               statue. Strong and soft at the 
               same time. I never could figure 
               out what Scott was doing here with 
               us on the street in the first 
               place, like he was on some sort of 
               crusade, to help the poor. Because 
               he really did come from a rich 
               Portland family. I know because he 
               brought me to his house one day 
               and showed me around. I mean, wow, 
               they were rich I They even had a 
               swimming pool. Scott's the only 
               kid that I had ever met that had a 
               swimming pool. I'd make a bet with 
               anybody right now, that Scott is a 
               saint or a hero, or some such 
               higher placed person.

     Meanwhile...
     Gary and Ray are talking. Ray, who is a Chicano street kid, is 
     looking poetically off into the distance.
     
                         RAY
               My father was a gaucho. But nobody 
               gonna find him. He killed a guy 
               and split. Nobody gonna find that 
               fuck. I never gonna find him.
     
     Ray spits into the gutter and the spit drifts in a small stream 
     made by the shop-owner who was washing his windows, down the 
     street and into drainage grating.
     
     View of MIKE as he closes his eyes, oblivious to what is going on 
     around him.
     
     The music in a DISCO blares, at night, and all we can see is 
     Mike's face, sleeping. The disco MUSIC STOPS, and the lights go 
     up.
     
     A broom passes by Mike's head.
     
     Finally, THE MANAGER'S SHOES appear at his head.
     
                         MANAGER (o. s.)
               What's wrong with him?  Passed 
               out?
     
     The shoes prod Mike.
     
                         MANAGER (o. s.)
               Hey, wake up.
     
     Mike wakes up in a WARD ROOM BED in the daytime.
     
     He looks around him. The room has a lot of light, windows 
     practically on all sides of the room. There are other DETOX men 
     and women in other beds. Mike gets up and starts to walk out, but 
     he is wearing a gown.
     
     A nurse stops him.
     
                         NURSE
               Excuse me. Are you all right?
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah. I'm fine. 
     
     (Mike looks around the room.)
     
                         NURSE
     
               If you're going to leave us, it's 
               okay, but we need you to sign out, 
               and you'll need to get your 
               clothes from downstairs.

                         MIKE
               Oh. Yeah. (he pauses and looks 
               around the place.) Do you live 
               here?

                         NURSE
               Why... no. But sometimes I feel 
               like I do.
     
     The nurse walks him over to a clipboard on a desk. Mike signs the 
     board, and she gives him a receipt.
     
                         MIKE
               What's this?
     
                         NURSE
     
               That's Just a receipt. if you 
               don't want it. You can throw it 
               away. That's what most people do 
               with it.
     
     Then we cut to Mike's face at night. As his eyes open he takes a 
     look around him, a little dazed, trying to figure where he is. We 
     see he is under a store awning. A lot of fog is rolling across 
     the street.

     A twenty-eight-year-old woman stops in a Mercedes Benz sedan, 
     similar to the one that the German man was driving. She motions 
     Mike to get inside the car.
     
     Dazed, Mike looks at the car, then responds.
     
                         MIKE
               This chick is living in a new car 
               ad.
     
     Inside a hallway entrance to the woman's home. Mike and the woman 
     take off their Jackets.
     
                         MIKE
               This is like a dream. A pretty 
               woman never picks me up.
     
     Mike begins to caress her arm.
     
                         LADY
               They Don't? Well. I Don't see why 
               not...
     
                         MIKE
               Is this your house?

     
                         LADY (caressing his head)
               Yes...
     
     Mike follows the woman into her...
     
     Living room where sit Scottie and Gary on a plush sofa. Mike sees 
     them.
     
                         MIKE
     
               Oh...

     Mike sits down in an easy chair next to the sofa.
     
                         MIKE
               What's up, Gary? Scottie?
     
                         GARY
               HEY, DUDE.
     
                         LADY
               You men make yourselves 
               comfortable, and I'll be right 
               back. There're cokes in the 
               refrigerator - help yourself.

     They watch her go.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               She's cool. She Just likes to have 
               three guys, 'cause - it takes her 
               a little while to get warmed up. 
               It's normal. Nothing kinky.

                         MIKE
               Oh.
     
     Mike looks around the room. Gary leans closer to Mike.
     
                         GARY
               Hey, did you get into that Van 
               Halen concert last night?

                         MIKE
               I've never been to a concert, 
               dude.
     
     Interior of the Woman's bedroom. Mike undresses. He waits by the 
     side of the bed and takes a last drag on a
     cigarette and puts it out. Then the woman arrives. lets down her 
     negligee and approaches Mike like an EARTH MOTHER, slowly, big 
     breasted, warm, comforting.
     
     As she approaches, Mike begins to see a familiar face. He is 
     upset when he looks into her eyes.  And he begins to 
     spasmodically shake then he grows sleepy, and finally, as she is 
     upon him, he passes out.
     
     Outside, Gary and Scottie struggle with Mike's body.
     
     They plop Mike down on the corner, under a streetlight, fold his 
     arms under his stomach and bend him over so he is sitting up 
     against the light pole.
     
                         SCOTT
               (putting money into his pocket) He 
               always does this! I'm surprised he 
               makes money at all.

                         GARY
               How do we tell if he's okay?
     
                         SCOTT
               Well, he's not dead.
     
     Scott listens to his heart.
     
                         SCOTT
               Listen.
     
     Gary listens.
     
                         SCOTT
               He's not dead. He's Just passed 
               out. It's a condition. It's called 
               narcolepsy.
     
                         GARY
               Scared the shit out of her. What 
               causes it. Sex?
     
                         SCOTT
               Stress. Some hustler, huh?
     
     Silence for a second.
     
                         GARY
               Where are we going to take him?
     
     Scott lifts Mike's body up and carries him to a soft carpet of 
     grass on the edge of a lawn. Scott looks around to see if it is 
     okay. Then he speaks to Mike even though he is asleep.
     
                         SCOTT
               Hey, little brother. You stay 
               here, and when you wake up, Just 
               come back into town. I'll be there 
               waiting for you. I figure you're 
               going to be safer here in this 
               comfy neighborhood than in the 
               city. I grew up in a neighborhood 
               like this. It'll be safe here.

     Scottie hides a tear. Then he takes his Jacket off and puts it 
     over Mike, then leaves him there.
     
     Mike's face is lying down with his nose pressed against a leafy 
     ground in the daytime.
     
     He wakes up, stands, makes his way up a slope and out to the 
     street. He brushes himself off as the Mercedes Benz shows up 
     again. Mike recognizes it, and walks up to the window of the car. 
     It is the MAN, though, not the lady. The Man speaks with a German 
     accent - and he is about 35 years old. HIS NAME IS HANS.
     
                         MIKE
               Hi.
     
                         HANS
               Say....
     
     Hans reads Mike's shirt.
     
                         HANS
               Say, Bill. What's happening?
     
     Mike brushes himself off and walks down the road, thinking that 
     the guy is weird.
     
                         MIKE
               Nothing much.
     
     Hans drives alongside Mike in his car.
     
                         HANS
               Do you want a lift? Bill?
     
                         MIKE
               Hey, isn't this the lady's car?
     
                         HANS
               Is Alena a friend of yours?  She's 
               a friend of mine. Any friend of 
               Alena's is a friend of mine. Do 
               you want to be my friend?
     
                         MIKE
               Not really.
     
                         HANS
               Get in and I'll take you 
               someplace. Yes? Where do you want 
               to go?

     Mike doesn't respond, and walks on.
     
     He pauses a moment, and looks at the houses in the neighborhood. 
     He looks down the street and can see Hans stopped in his car. The 
     guy gets out, and leans against the car.
     
                         MIKE
               This guy is a pervert. I can tell.
     
     To Hans:
     
                         MIKE
               Go home!
     
     THE HOUSES LINE THE STREET, EACH WITH A LITTLE CALIFORNIA STYLE 
     GARDEN. MIKE CAN SEE ALL THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES LIFT OFF, AND 
     THE FURNITURE INSIDE EACH HOUSE  FLY OUT AND CIRCLE IN THE AIR. 
     MIKE GETS THE JITTERS AND PASSES OUT.
     
     THE MERCEDES BENZ PULLS UP NEXT TO HIS HEAD, WHICH IS NOW ON THE 
     GROUND.
     
     PORtLAnd
     
     When Mike wakes up he is in Scottie's arms. They sit under a 
     statue in a park. The statue is of two Indians pointing out 
     across the horizon, and on the base of the statue is written: The 
     Coming of the White Man.
     
     Mike looks at Scott and then at the new surroundings. 
     At the Broadway Cafe Mike bites into a hamburger.
     
                         MIKE
               How'd we get home?
     
                         SCOTT
               That German guy. Hans. He brought 
               you downtown, you were passed out. 
               He said he was heading to 
               Portland, so I asked him for a 
               ride.
     
                         MIKE
               I don't remember any German guy.
     
                         SCOTT
               Well. You were sleeping.
     
                         MIKE
               How much do you make off me while 
               I'm sleeping?
     
                         SCOTT
               Just a ride, Mike. I don't make 
               anything. What, you think that I 
               sell your body while you are 
               asleep.
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah.
     
     Scott sips from a coffee cup.
     
                         SCOTT
               No, Mike. I'm on your side.
     
     He puts down the cup. Mike knows Scottie always tells the truth. 
     Mike is a little embarrassed, that he has maybe offended Scott's 
     honor.
     
                         MIKE
               I was Just kidding, dude.
     
                         SCOTT
               Gary's up here somewhere. He left 
               three days ago, he flew up with 
               some John.
     
                         MIKE
               Exotic. Have you seen your dad?
     
                         SCOTT
               Are you kidding?
     
                         MIKE
               I'd visit my dad, if he was here.
     
                         SCOTT
               I have to take care of you.
     
                         MIKE
               How about your mom?
     
                         SCOTT
               No.
     
                         MIKE
               That lady. She looked like. My 
               mother.
     
                         SCOTT
               Is that why you passed out?
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah. I mean. I don't know. She 
               really looked like my mother. I 
               must have been imagining things.
     
     A pause.
     
     The Broadway Cafe is beginning to pick up in business.  The table 
     where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window, and it is 
     semi-circular in shape. Scottie spies Gary across the street.
     
     He bounds up out of his chair and Mike watches him as he goes to 
     the door, kicks it open and yells to Gary.
     
                         SCOTT
               HEY' You dick!
     
     Gary sees Scott and runs across the street.
     
     Later in the BROADWAY CAFE, there are other street kids hanging 
     around the table.
     
     Scott has his arm around a girl named DENISE, who has a lot of 
     make up on and long stringy hair and who carries a teddy bear. 
     Denise is crying and Scott is consoling her.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
               It was almost as if Scott was on 
               some sort of crusade or mission, 
               when you checked him out.  He 
               could make you feel good right at 
               the very time that you felt so 
               bad. I remember there were many 
               times that I had been sobbing in 
               Scott's arms and he was helping me 
               out too. He was the great 
               protector of us all, and the great 
               planner. He gave us hope in the 
               future. Even though there was no 
               future. There must have been real 
               trouble at home, though, for Scott 
               not to want to visit his father.

     Scott strokes Denise's hair adoringly and gives her a kiss every 
     now and then.
     
     Mike looks across the table at CARL, a skinny kid with black hair 
     and a large floppy sports cap, and GARY, who is talking with him.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               That's Carl. He's always around 
               the Broadway, he didn't run away 
               from home like a lot of these kids 
               did. He had a mom, and no dad, at 
               least they didn't know where he 
               was. And one day, he came home to 
               the apartment where they lived, 
               and there was no mom anymore 
               either. He didn't know where she 
               went. That was sir months ago.

     MARY, an older, wiser street prostitute who is chain smoking Kool 
     cigarettes.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               That's Mary over there. She was a 
               mean old chick. She was maybe 
               thirty now. Old, old. Somebody 
               once told me that in the past, 
               Mary had this enemy, a chick that 
               had turned her in. And Mary had 
               gone off and kicked this chick to 
               death right in the street in front 
               of everybody. I don't know if it's 
               true, but I watched out, Just in 
               case. I was afraid of Mary. And 
               everyone else was too.
     
     Mary takes a drag from her cigarette and blows smoke in Mike's 
     face.
     
     Scott notices this. But he attends to Denise's problems.
     
     MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     (as he coughs)
     This was our little round table, a 
     point around which everything else 
     revolved. It was our "center." It was 
     like our home. Our living room. Not 
     everyone was the best of friends, but 
     everyone knew everyone else, and we 
     kind of stuck together.
     
     Mike on the street. He watches as a man carrying a large bag of 
     tin cans, crosses at a crosswalk. Mike steps up to him and begins 
     walking. His name is MARTY.
     
                         MIKE
               Hey Marty. What's goin' on?
     
                         MARTY
               Is that you Mike? Hey, what's new 
               with you? You look pretty good.
     
                         MIKE
               How many you got so far today?
     
                         MARTY
               I reckon that I picked up about 
               twenty-three bucks so far with 
               these cans, and some I got stashed 
               back in the bushes. You know the 
               old hiding place?
     
                         MIKE
               Wow!
     
                         MARTY
               Don't tell anybody, though. Just 
               between you and me. You need a 
               place to stay?

                         MIKE
               I always need a place to stay, 
               dude.

                         MARTY
               Yeah, well, I'm under the bridge. 
               You can Join me if you like.

                         MIKE
               Yeah, I think I'll rooftop it 
               tonight. I'm hanging with a 
               friend.

                         MARTY
               Am I walking too fast for you?
     
                         MIKE
     
               No, but I'll see you around. See 
     you under the bridge.
     
                         MARTY
     
               Okay, Mike.
     
     Mike stops walking with the guy and he splits down the street at 
     a fast clip.
     
     Inside the BROADWAY CAFE, Mike smokes a cigarette at the round 
     table and watches Gary and Carl playing keepaway with Denise's 
     teddy bear. Denise is swearing, using profanities that are 
     unusual for a girl.
     
     Night. Mike walks through a dark wet troubled inner-city alley 
     and on the other side, there is a parked car. In the car sits a 
     man in his 40's, bestial, good looking but overweight. He beeps 
     his car horn at Mike.
     
     Mike pauses, lights a cigarette coolly and walks to the car and 
     leans in the window.
     
                         MIKE
               Hey - what's up?
     
     Int. MOTEL, nighttime.
     
     The man is naked in the background standing In front of a mirror 
     in a motel bathroom, as Mike sits naked on a bed in front of a 
     t.v. set laughing at the show that is on.
     
     We see various still compositions of the two making love.
     
     Afield. Day. Two figures cross the field. One is Bob Pigeon, a 
     man in his fifties, and the other, his manservant, Budd. Because 
     of his girth, Bob has problems crossing the field.
     
                         BUDD
               Jesus. ..the things we've seen... 
               do you remember a thing since we 
               moved from graffiti bridge?
     
                         BOB
               No more of that, Budd.
     
                         BUDD
               Ha-ha, what a crazy night.
     
     Above the two walking figures, Gary wakes near a heating duct 
     atop a ten story building. He yawns, looks down at the street and 
     spies Bob and Budd.
     
     GARY'S VIEW: a tiny Bob and Budd are making their way across a 
     field.
     
                         GARY
               Hey, Scottie, here comes that fat 
               pig himself!!! He owes me money!

     Scottie, atop an adjacent building peeks his head over the edge. 
     The two guys are relatively close to one another but far from the 
     street.
     
                         SCOTT
               Who?
     
                         GARY
     
               You know, the fat one... Pigeon!

     
                         SCOTT
     
               He stole my shoes, the dick!
     
                         GARY
     
               Hey, everybody, here comes Bob the 
               chiseler!

     He yells to the other buildings and other street kids to wake up. 
     Scottie pours an old paper cup of Coca-Cola over Bob and Budd 
     below.
     
                         GARY
               Look out, it's raining Coke!
     
     Bob hears the show atop the buildings.
     
                         BOB
               Ah, I think my friends can see I 
               am back from Boise.

     Bob looks worried and happy at the same time, not knowing if they 
     are friend or foe. He shields himself from the Coke sprinkles.
     
                         BOB
               Do you see any clouds in the sky, 
               Budd?
     
                         BUDD
               No, Bob.
     
     The Derelict Hotel.
     
     Budd and Bob enter the threshold of a busted up but operating 
     hotel. There is a fire in a trashcan turned upside down, with 
     holes poked in it.
     
     Budd looks around the hotel.
     
                         BUDD
               Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?

                         BOB
               She's alive, Budd.
     
                         BUDD
               Is she holding on?
     
                         BOB
               Old... old, Budd.
     
                         BUDD
               She must be old, she has no 
               choice...
     
     THE TWO sit at a larger fire deeper into the derelict hotel.
     
                         BUDD
               I remember her daughter, she died 
               years ago... of old age. She must 
               be old, all right. That was before 
               I came to Clements Inn.

                         BOB
               (warming by the fire) 
               Ahh...
     
                         BUDD
     
               Jesus... the things that we've 
               seen. Aren't I right, Bob? Aren't 
               I right?
     
                         BOB
     
               We have seen the light at the end 
               of the tunnel...
     
                         BUDD
               That we have, that we have... in 
               fact Bob, we have. Jesus... the 
               things that we've seen.

     Scott drinks from a beer can inside the derelict hotel, tosses it 
     to a young boy, laughs, wipes his mouth and puts his lit 
     cigarette into the mouth of Gary, making his way to some steps, 
     through a circle of girls, kisses Denise, who we remember from 
     the Broadway Cafe, and charges up the steps.
     
     Inside the hotel on a staircase landing, Scottie passes a couple 
     of figures, one is asleep and one is awake.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               Where's Bob?
     
                         A BOY
               Fast asleep.
     
                         BUDD
               And he's snoring like a horse.
     
     SCOTTIE OPENS A DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WALKS INTO A 
     ROOM, INTERRUPTING MIKE, WHO STANDS OVER BOB'S SNORING BODY.
     
     Mike coolly holds up a wad of bills and a folded envelope of 
     cocaine.
     
                         MIKE
               I picked his pocket.
     
                         SCOTTIE 
               (whispering) 

               What did you get, dude?
     
                         MIKE
     
               Just this.
     
     Scottie takes the cocaine from him, sits down at the foot of the 
     bed and begins to unfold the packet. Bob turns in the bed and the 
     rush of air from the sheets blows the white powder out of the 
     packet.
     
                         BOB
     
               What the hell?
     
     Mike laughs.
     
                         BOB
     
               What time is it, son?
     
                         SCOTTIE 
               (climbing in bed with Bob)
               What do you care?

     Bob, dazed, is looking around himself, like he is being had.
     
                         SCOTTIE 
               (amusing Mike)
               Why, you wouldn't even look at a 
               clock, unless hours were lines of 
               coke, dials looked like the signs of 
               gay bars, or time itself was a fair 
               hustler in black leather... isn't 
               that right, dude?

     Bob staggers out of bed retching and spitting. Then back into his 
     waking stupor, feeling something is being put over on him.
     
                         SCOTT
               There's no reason to know the 
               time. We are timeless.

     Bob checks his wallet.
     
                         BOB
               Aren't you forgetting, Scottie my 
               boy, [A GOVERNOR'S SON], that we 
               who steal, do so at midnight?

     Bob's money and cocaine are gone. Bob turns angry and bellows.
     
                         BOB
               What the...who ripped me off?  
               Budd!!! Budd!!!
     
     Stairs again
     
                         BUDD
               Yes, Bob!!!
     
     Budd stands at the stoop and comes through the door, Just as Bob 
     is running out.
     
                         BOB
               I fell asleep and have been 
               robbed!
     
     Jane!!!
     
     The room below.
     
     Jane Lightwork, the owner of the established hotel, comes to 
     arms. She is very old.
     
                         JANE
               You'd think that I could keep the 
               peace in my house...
     
     Scott and Mike laugh. Mike gets down on his hands and knees and 
     tries to scoop up a little cocaine from the floor.
     
     Bedroom.
     
     Hall
     
                         JANE
               Bob, Bob we'll find your drugs. 
               We'll find them.
     
     Another hall.
     
     Bob is storming down it in a rage, people opening doors of the 
     rooms.
     
                         BOB
               Jane, I know you well enough...
     
     Yet another hall.
     
     Hotel dwellers are watching Jane move down the hall answering 
     Bob.
     
                         JANE
               I know you, ~ you owe me money, 
               Bob, and now you pick a fight with 
               me, and are disturbing the peace 
               of my hotel.
     
     MAIN derelict hall of the hotel.
     
     Bob parades, in his night clothes, in front of a gathering of 
     outcasts in the hotel.
     
                         BOB
               This hotel is full of thieves... 
               Junkies!
     
                         JANE
               You are the thief!
     
                         BOB
               They picked my pocket!
     
     LAUGHTER from the throngs of outcasts. Jane enters a balcony 
     overlook of the main hall. Mike and Scott enter, arms around each 
     other, laughing.
     
                         JANE
               It's impossible to board a dozen 
               or so men and women who live 
               honestly and have the others live 
               like Junkies.
     
     One of the dwellers listening to the argument is shooting up as 
     they speak. We see a close view of the needle and Bob running 
     around in the background.
     
     Bob makes his way next to Scott.
     
                         BOB
               You have corrupted me, Scottie, I 
               was an innocent before I met you. 
               ..and now look at me.. just a 
               little better than wicked. I used 
               to be a virtuous man...

     Scottie is laughing at him.
     
                         BOB
               '''well, virtuous enough. I swore 
               a little. I never gambled more 
               than seven times a week. Poker. I 
               never picked up a street boy more 
               than once a quarter...

     Scottie laughs.
                         BOB
               ... of an hour. Bad company has 
               corrupted me. I'll be darned if I 
               haven't forgotten what the inside 
               of a church looks like.
     
                         MIKE
               Where do you find your strike 
               tonight, Bob?
     
                         SCOTTIE
               I see a good change for Bob to 
               make. From Stealing to Preaching.
     
                         BOB
               Stealing is my vocation, Scott. 
               It's not a sin for a man to labor 
               at his vocation.

                         GARY
               Hey... .......
     
     The three gather around Gary.
     
                         GARY
               Very early tomorrow morning, there 
               will be small time rock and roll 
               promoters coming back from their 
               show. Every night, they walk home 
               with the loot and they stop by the 
               Grotto Bar, one mile away from 
               here, and more often than not 
               they've been drinking already. If 
               we can't steal from them on their 
               way to the bar, we can get them 
               when they come out. See, dude?
     
                         MIKE
               I'm not gonna rob anybody.  I'd 
               rather sell my ass. Straight and 
               simple. It's less risky.
     
                         BOB
               So long as I don't know these guys 
               personally. ..it's okay with me.
     
                         GARY
               They're from Beaverton. New to the 
               business...

                         MIKE
               Not me. I'm not going along on 
               this crackpot scheme. Especially 
               since Gary thought it up.
     
                         BOB
               Come oft it, Mikey. Find a better 
               way to make a buck. Something to 
               fall back on, other than your ass.

                         MIKE
               Scott's inheritance.
     
     Bob walks away from the two others.
     
                         SCOTT
               (whispering)
               Come along, Mikey. I have a joke I 
               wanna play... a joke I can't pull 
               off alone...
     
     Mike laughs and joins Bob, hugging him around his fat belly.
     
                         BOB
               Oh, my sweetheart, come and rob 
               with us tomorrow.
     
                         MIKE
               I was going to come anyway.
     
     SCOTT hugs the others too.
     
                         MIKE
               We'll be rich!!!
     
     Scottie dances away.
     
                         SCOTT
               Provide for us, oh great 
               psychedelic Papa!
     
     Scottie grabs Denise and kisses her then begins to leave through 
     the door. He throws her to Mike who catches her and runs off with 
     her.
     
                         SCOTT
               Good catch dude. ..and meet me on 
               three street!
     
     Scott leaves, Bob follows him:
     0utside the derelict hotel.
     
                         BOB
               Scott. When you inherit your 
               fortune, on your twenty-first 
               birthday, let's see. ..how far 
               away is this?

                         SCOTT
               One week away, Bob, just one more 
               week.
     
                         BOB
               Let's not call ourselves robbers, 
               but Diannah's foresters. Gentlemen 
               of the shade. Minions of the Moon. 
               Men of good government.
     
                         SCOTT
               (under his breath)
               When I turn twenty-one, I don't want 
               any more of this life. My mother and 
               father will be surprised at the 
               incredible change. It will impress 
               them more when such a fuck up like 
               me turns good than if I had been a 
               good son all along. All the past 
               years I will think of as one big 
               vacation. At least it wasn't as 
               boring as schoolwork. All my bad 
               behavior I'm going to throw away to 
               pay my debt. I will change when 
               everybody expects it the least.

     Scott turns and leaves.
     
                         BOB
               And you will become a hard roller, 
               a hatchet man for your old man.
     
     Scott laughs to himself, because he knows Bob is misunderstanding 
     him. Bob is part of the past life that he says he is going to 
     throw away.
     
                         SCOTT
               No! You will be the hatchet man, 
               Bob, that will be your job, and so 
               there will rarely be a job 
               hatcheted. It will be one big 
               endless party, won't it?
     
     Bob laughs. Scott walks across a field.
     
                         BOB
               Well, at least my little friend 
               has offered me a job. They are so 
               good to me.
     
     Inside the Broadway Cafe. Day.
     
     Denise and Mike hang out together. Both are smoking cigarettes 
     which have made a billow of smoke that hangs over the table that 
     is in the front window.
     
                         DENISE
               Moms are great, because, you know, 
               I could always go to my mom and 
               say, hey I need a new lipstick, 
               and she would always give me money 
               for that. That was great.

                         MIKE
               I only saw my mom once, but I 
               remember what she looked like. She 
               was very beautiful.

                         DENISE
               What do you mean, once?
     
                         MIKE
               When I was born.
     
                         DENISE
               How could you remember when that 
               god-awful thing happened?

                         MIKE
               Dunno. But I remember it. how 
               beautiful and kind she good. Yeah, 
               I remember was. She was good

                         DENISE
               And she split from you, huh?
     
                         MIKE
               Maybe she didn't mean to.
     
                         DENISE
               Did you see what was going on, 
               Mike? Between Pinky and Dale? Did 
               you see that? That's the third 
               fight I've seen today. Things 
               always happen in threes.

                         MIKE
               I don't know. They have a sort of, 
               ah, relationship. Between them.
     
     Across the street there are three people, a TALL MAN, who has his 
     hat stuck on his boot and a lady and another man with a dog on a 
     leash.
     
                         MIKE
               I don't know about that, but, ah, 
               listen, what you and me talk 
               about, it's just between us, you 
               understand? Hey, what's over 
               there, see those assholes? Who are 
               they, you know any of them?
     
                         DENISE
               I can't see that far
     
     DENISE STANDS AND OPENS THE FRONT DOOR AND YELLS ACROSS THE 
     STREET.
     
                         DENISE
               HEY!
     
     The group across the street look up and begin yelling back, but 
     we cannot hear them.
     
     Under the Burnside Bridge, day.
     
     Mike and Denise kiss, and their arms are entangled in a loving, 
     but awkward embrace. Twigs and leaves are caught in Denise's hair 
     as they are lying on the ground.
     
     Different STILL COMPOSITIONS OF SEX while they are lying in the 
     wilds under the bridge.
     
     Then...
     
     Denise lights a cigarette.
     
                         DENISE
               That reminds me, I gotta send my 
               Ma a Christmas card, I still 
               haven't done it yet.

                         MIKE
               Yeah, I haven't done it either.
     
                         DENISE
               Your mom lives in Idaho right now?
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah.
     
                         DENISE
               I used to live in Montana.
     
                         MIKE
               My own cousin. He's dead. that's 
               one...two... And my grandma, it 
               usually comes in threes.

                         DENISE
               Does come in threes.
     
                         MIKE
               My cousin died, my grandmother 
               died, and right after she died, 
               her daughter died. My aunt. Within 
               a year. And they wuz all women, 
               not even a year, six...well.... 
               six months-eight months, three 
               women in the family died.
     
     A pause.
     
                         MIKE
               That's funny, huh? I WONDER WHY 
               YOU THOUGHT THAT, cuz, my FATHER 
               says stuff like that.

                         DENISE
               Well, my grandma was 
               superstitious.
     
                         MIKE
               My father told me that, said 
               things usually come in threes... 
               and I said, .... you're crazy.
     
     A Long pause. A motorcycle passes, someone yells, and a horn 
     honks.
     
                         MIKE
               It sounds crazy. That's my lucky 
               number too.
     
                         DENISE
               Huh?
     
                         MIKE
               Three.
     
                         DENISE
               Mine's eight. 
     
                         MIKE
               I like three.
     
                         DENISE
               You know why I like eight?
     
                         MIKE
               Why?
     
                         DENISE
               Cause of the eight ball. You know. 
     When you're stuck behind the eight 
     ball? I fuckin' feel stuck behind 
     the eight ball today, I'll tell 

     you. The business is so slow in the 
     middle of the week, you know that 
     Mike?
     
     Public bathroom. Night.
     
     Mike empties the contents of his pockets at a bathroom sink. He 
     has in his possession: One condom. One comb with blond hair stuck 
     in it. One nickel. Half a stick of gum. One knife with the letter 
     W stamped on it.
     
     He arranges these things in a neat order on the surface of the 
     sink while a man flushes a toilet in the background and uses 
     another sink. Mike is quite at home here. He takes his time 
     arranging the articles, and washing his hands. He looks over at 
     the man washing his hands and gives him a friendly smile.
     
     The man leaves. Mike puts all the things on the sink into his 
     pockets. Then he walks over to a urinal, unzips his fly and 
     starts to take a leak. A shadow opens the door in back of him, 
     and without turning around, Mike senses the presence of a man.

     Alleyway. Night.
     
     Scottie is helping Bob with a disguise, putting on pants over a 
     large belly, with medallions around the neck.
     
                         SCOTT
               How long has it been, Bob, since 
               you could see your own feet?
     
                         BOB
               About four years, Scottie. Four 
               years of grief. It blows a man up 
               like a balloon.

     Mike and Budd appear, running, with costumes on. There are two 
     others behind them.
     
                         MIKE
               There's rock and roll money 
               walking this way!
     
                         BUDD
               And they're drunk as skunks.

                         MIKE
               This is going to be easy. We can 
               do it lying down.

                         SCOTT
               But don't fall asleep, now, Mike.
     
                         BUDD
               Shh! Here they come!
     
                         SCOTT
               You four should head them off 
               there!
     
                         BOB
               We four? How many are walking with 
               them?
     
                         MIKE
               About six.

                         BOB
               Huh, shouldn't they be robbing us?
     
     Scottie laughs. Bob waddles along the side of the alleyway, 
     stepping on a curb, then in a pothole losing his balance. Another 
     accomplice whistles from atop a building. We SEE the group of 
     ROCK AND ROLL promoters.
     
     Bob walks further from Mike and Scottie.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               If they escape from you, we'll get 
               them here.
     
     Bob struggles as he walks.
     
                         BOB
               Eight feet of cobblestones is like 
               30 yards of flat road with me.

     Mike and Scott run off, laughing at him.
     
                         BOB
               I can't see a damned thing in 
               here.
     
                         BUDD
               Jesus, will you shut up! And keep 
               on your toes!

     Budd sees the promoters coming and waves to Bob as he lies down 
     on the ground.
     
                         BUDD
               Lie down!!
     
                         BOB
               Lie down!?
     
                         BUDD
               Lie down and stay quiet, until 
               they round the corner and we'll 
               ambush them.

                         BOB
               Have you got a crane to lift me up 
               again?
     
     Budd laughs.
     
                         MIKE
               They're coming!!
     
     Down the way, the rock and roll promoters are approaching, having 
     no knowledge of the buffoonery at the other end of the tunneling 
     alleyway. They are drunk.
     
                         VICTIM 1
               Come along neighbor, Tommy will 
               lead the way. I've lost track of 
               time... (burp)
     
     At the other end of the alley:
     
     Bob and three others are marching in procession, chanting, a 
     facsimile of Rashneesh, but a bad act.
     
     The rock promoters approach, smashing a bottle.
     
                         VICTIM 1
               Who are these jokers?
     
                         VICTIM 2
               Rashneesh, listen!
     
                         VICTIM 1
               They're chanting....
     
     Scottie and Mike hide behind garbage cans, laughing.
     
     The rock promoters circle the group of chanting Rashneesh.
     
                         VICTIM 3
               I thought that all you Rashneesh 
               had up and left...
     
     Victim 1 pours a beer on one of their heads. Just as he does this 
     Bob pulls out two long pistols, almost heavy enough that he 
     cannot hold them straight, barrels parallel.
     
                         BOB
               Aha! One move and I'll blow you 
               away, you sully scumbags, up 
               against that wall!
     
     One of the victims falls down and begins to run away. One of 
     Bob's men starts after him. A lockbox that he was carrying falls 
     to the ground. Bob spies it.
     
                         BOB
               No! Let him go!
     
     Bob aims one pistol at the running figure as he keeps the others 
     against the wall with the other pistol. He fires three times. One 
     of Bob's boys grabs the lockbox.
     
     A VIEW of the running figure, bullets cutting around him.
     
                         BOB
               Look at him go! 
     
                         VICTIM 2
               Don't shoot us!
     
     Bob winks at the lockbox and shoots the gun in the air.
     
     All the rock promoters go running. Bob charges after them, firing 
     the gun twice more in the air, then once at the lockbox, breaking 
     it open.
     
                         BOB
               The valise is open. Let's see what 
               we got.
     
     Mike and Scottie hiding behind trashcans.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               Where are our disguises?

     Mike runs to his stash and finds two large capes and large hats. 
     They put these on.
     
     Bob finds wads of money and receipts.
     
                         BOB
               Ticket anyone? To next week's 
               show?
     
     He throws these on the ground and the boys fall over themselves 
     for the tickets. Bob wads the money and puts it back in the box, 
     laughing to himself.
     
     Mike and Scottie sneak closer to the group still hiding, long 
     flowing capes concealing their identity.
     
                         BOB
               Scott and Mike have disappeared, 
               did the shots scare them away?
     
     They sneak closer. Mike lights a big firecracker and waits.
     
                         BOB
               ...maybe we should get the hell 
               out of here. But, are they such 
               chickens?
     
     A LOUD EXPLOSION!
     
     Mike and Scottie, disguised, jump out with large silver baseball 
     bats, swinging them and making as much noise as they can, 
     knocking over a set of garbage cans, flashing flashlights into 
     Bob and the others' eyes.
     
     Frightened, Bob drops the lockbox and runs, the others follow, 
     Mike and Scottie hitting them with the bats as they go.
     
                         BOB
               Get the box! Oh, Fuck!
     
     Mike swings the bat at Bob, it grazes the side of a building and 
     sparks fly from it. Bob wheezes from the run.
     
     Scottie chases the others in the same direction.
     
     They stand, kicking garbage cans and watching them run, 
     convulsing with laughter.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               The thieves scatter!
     
                         MIKE
               Bob Pigeon will sweat to death!
     
     Jack Favor enters the Governor's CHAMBERS day.
     
                         JACK
               Can anyone tell me about my son?
     
     He walks across the room.
     
                         JACK
               It's been a full three months 
               since I last saw him. Where is my 
               son Scott?

                         AID
               We don't know, sir.
     
                         JACK
               Ask around in Old Town, in some of 
               the taverns there. Some say he 
               frequently is seen down there 
               drinking with street denizens. 
               Some who they say even rob our 
               citizens and store owners. I can't 
               believe that such an effeminate 
               boy supports such 'friends.'
     
     A high overhead (helicopter?) view of the country landscape in 
     the early morning. Far below us on a lonely road is a small dot, 
     a motorcycle, traveling east.
     
     Further along on its travels, the motorcycle crosses a steel 
     BRIDGE.
     
     Old Town day.
     Scottie and Mike, riding on a stolen motorcycle, sweep through 
     the early morning streets without being noticed.
     
     Stopping at a stop light in the city.
     
     Scott pauses to think.
     
                         SCOTT
               Mikey, do you realize how long I 
               have been here out on the streets, 
               on this crusade?

                         MIKE
               About as long as the rest of us. I 
               mean. I can't even remember that 
               far back, Scott, I mean   
     
                         SCOTT
               It's been three years, Mike.
     
                         MIKE
               Wow... that's a really long time, 
               Scott. Have I been here three 
               years, too?
     
                         SCOTT
               What I'm getting at, Mike, is that 
               we are survivors.
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah, well, so, isn't that 
               obvious?
     
                         SCOTT
               Yes. It is incredibly obvious. 
               They could drop a bomb on this 
               city and you know what we would 
               do?
     
                         MIKE
               (thinking)
               DIE?
     
                         SCOTT
               No. We would survive. Because we 
               are... 
     
                         MIKE
               Survivors!
     
                         SCOTT
               Right, Mike.
     
                         MIKE
               Say, Scott. Whaddya say we go 
               survive over at the Broadway Cafe 
               a little bit, at least it's warm 
               over there.
     
     Int. Broadway Cafe. Day.
     
     Mike and Scott sit around the table with Carl and Mary. Mike 
     blows a smoke ring.
     
     Denise runs in the door of the cafe, excited about something.
     
                         DENISE
               MIKE! Scottie! There's a man from 
               City Hall down the street. He 
               wants to speak with you, Scottie.
     
                         SCOTT
               What's that?
     
                         DENISE
               He says that he's sent by your 
               father.
     
                         SCOTT
               Say hello and send him to my 
               mother.
     
                         MIKE
               What kind of a man is it?
     
                         DENISE
               A young man. And he's got cops 
               with him.
     
                         SCOTT
               Cops....
     
     Street exterior day.
     
     Two POLICEMEN and one OFFICIAL are walking down the street toward 
     the Broadway cafe.
     
     Broadway Cafe interior day.
     
     The cops enter, passing The PROPRIETOR of the cafe, an aging 
     heavyset woman named NANCY.
     
                         NANCY
               Good morning, officers...
     
                         COP 2
               How are you this morning, NANCY? 
               Don't mind if we take a look 
               around your place, do you?

     One officer is already inspecting the stolen motorcycle outside.
     
     Mike sees this, and looks the other way from the cop who is 
     peering in the Broadway cafe window.
     
                         COP 1
               Have you seen the young Scott 
               Favor?
     
                         NANCY
               I do believe he was here just a 
               second ago. Nancy looks in the 
               front window.

                         NANCY
               Oh, yeah, there he is.
     
     Nancy points Scott out.
     
     Scott is giving Denise a long kiss, hiding from the cops.  The 
     OFFICIAL walks to the front window of the Cafe.  Scott pretends 
     he is being rudely interrupted.
     
                         SCOTT
               Ah-ha... what have we here?
     
                         OFFICIAL
               Excuse me... Mr. Favor... we have 
               been sent in search of a fat 
               man... a large bearded....

                         COP 1
               FAT MAN...
     
                         COP 2
               Goes by Bob Pigeon.
     
                         SCOTT
               Bob Pigeon?
     
                         COP 1
               That's right.
     
                         SCOTT
               What do you want with him?
     
                         COP 2
               Ahem. There's been a report, sir, 
               he has been involved in a 
               holdup...
     
                         COP 1
               Last night. Have you seen him?
     
                         SCOTT
               I saw him around last night, when 
               was the holdup?
     
                         COP 1 
               Late. Two in the morning.
     
                         SCOTT
               I saw him about four, but he 
               wasn't very loose with his wallet. 
               Did he get away with any of the 
               money?
     
                         COP 2
               Yes, indeed, sir... two thousand 
               dollars of a rock promoter's 
               money.
     
                         SCOTT 
               Well, anyway, I haven't seen him 
               recently. Why do you look here?
     
                         COP 1
     
               They say he has friends here.
     
                         SCOTTIE
     
               I beg your pardon.
     
                         COP 2 
               Sorry...
     
                         OFFICIAL
               Sorry for the interruption. We 
               have a message for you from your 
               father. He says that he would like 
               to see you as soon as possible.
     
     THE OFFICIAL HANDS SCOTT AN ENVELOPE. 
     
                         SCOTT
     
               Thank you for your message. 
     
     Scott takes the envelope and puts it on the table.
     
     street, day.
     
     The police close the door.
     
                         COP 1
     
               Hmmm.
     
                         COP 2
               What about the dead body.
     
                         COP 1
               Let's not get Favor's kid involved 
               in this report if we can help it. 
               But if he were my son, I'd....

     Cop 1 makes a fist and slams It In the palm of his other hand.
     
     INT. Broadway Cafe.
     
                         MIKE
               Bob is a wanted man now.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               And as dangerous to be around as 
               cops themselves.
     
                         MIKE
               We need a hiding place.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               Where should we go?
     
                         MIKE
               To visit my brother.
     
                         SCOTT
               You have a brother?
     
                         MIKE
               Yes, I have one.
     
                         SCOTT
               Where is he?
     
                         MIKE
               He's in     he's in
     
     Mike suddenly begins to shake, and, falls asleep.
     
     Scottie picks up the envelope from his father and puts it in his 
     pocket.
     
     Mike and Scott are stuck on a long straight road in the desert. 
     Mike is angry at Scott because he doesn't think he knows how the 
     motorcycle works.
     
     Scott is trying again and again to start the engine.
     
                         MIKE
               Come on...
     
                         SCOTT
               Shut up, Mike.
     
     He tries to turn it over again.
     
                         SCOTT
               If I had known that it was going 
               to be this hard to start, then I 
               wouldn't have stopped it at all.

     Mike looks at the road and the surrounding area. It is the same 
     road that he was stuck on in the beginning.
     
                         MIKE
               Scott? I just know that I have 
               been on this road before.
     
     Mike stares at the face in the road. Two cactus for eyes, 
     mountains for hair, a cloud shadow forms the mouth over a red 
     nose road with a dotted line running down it.
     
     At night, Scott and Mike sit next to a fire they have made on the 
     side of the road.  We can hear Indians in the distance dancing 
     and chanting a song.
     
                         MIKE
               It sure is lonely out in the 
               desert.
     
                         SCOTT
               Yeah, I guess.
     
                         MIKE
               If I had had a normal family, and 
               a good upbringing, then I would 
               have been a well adjusted person. 
               But somehow that just didn't work 
               out.
     
                         SCOTT
               Depends on what you'd call 
               "normal. -
     
                         MIKE
               Well, normal, you know, with a mom 
               and a dad and a dog and shit like 
               that... normal.
     
                         SCOTT
               So you didn't have a dog?  Or you 
               didn't have a dad...
     
                         MIKE
               I didn't have a dog and I didn't 
               have a dad. Well, not a normal 
               dad...
     
     The music is getting louder. It sounds like a war chant.
     
                         MIKE
               Hey Scott?
     
                         SCOTT
               What?
     
     Mike is hesitating.  He is about to say something personal.  He 
     looks at Scott and back to the fire, a few times too many.
     
                         SCOTT
               What, Mike?
     
                         MIKE
               Oh.  Have you ever.  Uh...
     
     Scott is getting Mike's drift. Mike rubs his crotch.
     
                         MIKE
               I mean, don't you ever get horny?
     
                         SCOTT
               Yeah.  But...
     
                         MIKE
               Oh, yeah... not for a guy.
     
                         SCOTT
               Mike.  Two guys can't love each 
               other.  They can only be friends.
     
     An awkward moment passes where Mike is looking away from Scott 
     and Scott can't help but look at Mike.  Then Scott catches Mike's 
     eye and motions for him to come closer to him.
     
     Mike walks over to Scott and Scott holds him in his arms.
     
     Overhead VIEW of the two in front of the campfire.
     
                         SCOTT
               I only have sex for money.
     
     Mike starts to get out some money.
     
                         SCOTT
               I can't take your money.
     
     A pause.
     
                         SCOTT
               But we can be close friends.
     
     The next morning. Mike is sleeping. As he opens his eyes, he can 
     see Scott still trying to start the motorcycle.
     
     Mike stands and looks down the road at an approaching State 
     Police Car. Mike, afraid of the police, starts to move into the 
     bushes.
     
     Scott is out of breath trying to start the bike.
     
                         MIKE
               Scott, look...
     
     Scott looks in the direction of the police car.
     
                         SCOTT
               Looks like this is it.
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah.
     
     Scott hits the side of the gas tank of the bike with the palm of 
     his hand.
     
                         SCOTT
               Can't get the bike started. Cops 
               are coming. Stuck in the middle of 
               nowhere with a stolen bike. Yeah, 
               Mike. Looks like this is the end.
     
     The policeman pulls up to them and parks.
     
     The policeman sits in his car for a second and reports into the 
     radio, then he gets out and walks over to the boys.
     
     Mike gets scared and runs into the desert.
     
     The cop stands and watches. Mike has nowhere to go, he is running 
     into an open desert.
     
     The policeman, a full blooded American Indian, seems amused at 
     his power. He looks at Scott then back at Mike, who trips in the 
     desert and falls in a cloud of dust.
     
                         COP
               What's the matter with him?
     
                         SCOTT
               I don't know. I guess he doesn't 
               like cops.
     
                         COP
               Yeah.
     
                         SCOTT
               That's how it looks.
     
                         COP
               What are you kids doing out here?
     
                         SCOTT
               This cycle is one bitch to turn 
               over. But you probably don't know 
               about motorcycles. You aren't a 
               motorcycle cop.
     
                         COP
               I turned a few.
     
     Scott walks through the desert looking for Mike where he dropped. 
     He picks him up out of the dirt, spit dripping from his sleeping 
     lips, and smacks him in the face.
     
                         SCOTT
               Wake up, Mikey, the heat's off.
     
     Mike will not wake up.
     
     When Mike wakes up. He is inside a TRAILER at night.
     
     Scott is eating sandwiches to his right that are on a little TV. 
     tray.
     
     There is MIKE'S BROTHER leaning into him on his left. He looks at 
     Mike offensively. His brother is very good looking, but looks 
     like he has lost his mind somewhere down the line. Which is why 
     he lives in the desert in a trailer, away from people.
     
                         SCOTT
               Look, Mike. Sandwiches.
     
                         BROTHER
               Your mother... now she was a right 
               woman. She used to be so proud of 
               you... you know... she would just 
               beam. And not Jim Beam either. If 
               you know what I mean. We used to 
               drive for hours to get a look at 
               you. I remember, what was it... 
               eighteen years ago?

                         MIKE
               Twenty-one.
     
                         BROTHER
               Is that how old you are now? I 
               thought you wuz younger than 
               that... what? Well anyway, we 
               would start off in the morning to 
               see you, and it would take an hour 
               to get to the institution. You 
               were maybe one year old. What?  I 
               wasn't proud that you had to live 
               in an institution, mind you... but 
               all the same, when I would look at 
               you, all the institutional walls 
               would come down and we were a 
               family. Your mom, me, and you. God 
               knows where dad was.
     
     Mike is getting visibly upset. Scott gets up to go to the 
     bathroom.
     
     Inside the bathroom night.
     
     Scott enters and notices a velvet portrait of a woman hanging on 
     the wall. Off screen Scott can hear Mike and his Brother.
     
                         MIKE (o.s.)
               I don't belong to you, DUDE... I'm 
               not yours...
     
                         BROTHER (o.s.)
               (his voice booms out so 
               unexpectedly deep and loud that 
               Scott is startled) Shut your 
               mouth! Don't you talk back...
     
     His brother hits the table with a crash.
     
     Living room night.
     
                         BROTHER
               Well... (takes a breath )
               Anyway. You were maybe not in the 
               biological sense, my brother, but in 
               our business, ~..... (holds his 
               hands up in the air) And If I'm not 
               Your brother, how's come you turned 
               out exactly like me then?
     
     Mike has gotten the jitters and fallen asleep in front of him.
     
     Scott enters from the bathroom.
     
                         BROTHER
               Oh, he'll come out or it. It's 
               like this whenever we get together  
               It's always like this when we get 
               together  It's the way that we say 
               hello to each other.
     
     He holds his head down.
     
                         BROTHER
               I'm all that he's got. But he 
               doesn't want me. He doesn't care. 
               He'd rather live out on the 
               streets. I love him, though.
     
     Scott looks around the trailer at all the velvet portraits 
     hanging on the walls.
     
                         BROTHER
               Oh. I paint these for a living. 
               But sometimes the people don't 
               send the check when they get 
               finished. So I keep them. I like 
               them.
     
     Ext. Trailer. Night.
     
     Mike and his brother sip iced tea. Colored lights decorate the 
     trailer.
     
                         BROTHER
               Want me to tell you what happened 
               to your Mom? Have you ever heard 
               it? Did you ever hear what the 
               hell happened to her?
     
                         MIKE
               No. But I don't care.

                         BROTHER
               You loved her, and don't tell know 
               you did. me you didn't. I
     
                         MIKE
               I didn't even know her.
     
                         BROTHER
               Yeah, you loved her, though.
     
                         MIKE
               I already heard what happened to 
     her.
     
                         BROTHER
               But you don't know the whole 
               story. One thing about the truth. 
               It's interesting.
     
                         MIKE
               I don't care.
     
                         BROTHER
               If you had known her, you would 
               care. She would see guys on the 
               side. At night. When I wouldn't be 
               around... maybe I'd be in San 
               Francisco or some darned place, 
               doing my own business. God knows 
               where. She would see guys... 
               yeah.... anyway   along comes this 
               guy. A guy we both knew. A guy who 
               was into cards. A gamblin' man. 
               And he said that he used to herd 
               cattle in Argentina. I dunno, 
               maybe he did, and he had a bit of 
               money. More'n I had at that point 
               in time. But it was funny, the way 
               he gambled. He was not safe in the 
               friends that he made. So his money 
               would come and go real fast....

                         MIKE
               I never heard this one before.
     
                         BROTHER
               So this guy, your Mom fell for. 
               What? She went cuckoo over this 
               guy. Well, their affair went on 
               for a year or so and your mom 
               wanted to marry this guy. She was 
               already married to our real dad. 
               So he said no. He didn't love her 
               anyways. But she wanted him to 
               marry her. And to have a little 
               family. That's when you were born. 
               As a matter of fact, you were 
               really the cause of this whole 
               mess. She wanted to make a little 
               family and take you and this guy 
               someplace and set something up.
     
     (slaps his leg with his hand)
     
     A family thing! Ridiculous, right. A 
     card man. Had a bunch of money, but 
     could have just as well lost it on 
     his next hand. Probably did too. Well 
     you'll see what I'm getting at.
     
                         MIKE
               That's not how I heard it.
     
                         BROTHER
               Yeah, I know. You heard it from me 
               and I'm telling it different this 
               time, see? So this Mom of yours 
               found herself a fuckin' gun. I 
               thought she was going to blow me 
               away with it one night. She got so 
               into this gun. She would flash it 
               to anybody that gave her trouble. 
               She would sleep with it. Yeah... 
               strange, huh? She would stir fry 
               vegetables with the loaded gun. 
               What? I mean    What? I used to 
               say, politely, "Mom, don't go 
               stirring up dinner with the gun, 
               now, you'll blow a hole in the 
               frying pan." What?
     
     Mike begins to cry.
     
                         BROTHER
               And she used to do other things 
               with this gun. Sexy things with 
               it. Oh, boy, she was into this 
               thing. I just thought it was some 
               sort of weird phase that she was 
               going through. And so anyway, this 
               guy, who she was cuckoo over, 
               brought her to the movies one 
               night. A drive-in movie in a 
               stolen car, don't-chaknow, what? 
               And the movie was.... ah.... RIO 
               BRAVO or some shit like that. And 
               well, she went and shot this 
               guy.... don't-cha-know.
     
                         MIKE
               You're making this up as you go 
               along, bro.
     
                         BROTHER
               And they didn't find him until the 
               next show, RIO BRAVO playing on 
               the big screen. Spilled popcorn 
               soaking up the blood.
     
     Mike begins to really cry now, bawling and coughing.
     
                         SCOTT
               (who has been listening) 
               Oh, come on, how corny, man....
     
                         BROTHER
               No. Your mom had to split, and 
               split she did. And that guy. That 
               guy was your real father.
     
                         MIKE (sniffs)
               I knew that was coming. You sure 
               do like to make me cry, bro.
     
                         BROTHER
               And I got this card from her, not 
               too awful long ago. Maybe a year.
     
     Mike's Brother hands him a postcard with a Holiday Inn motel on 
     the front of it. Written on the card, Mike's mom says she is 
     working as a waitress there, in the "Blue Room" of the Holiday 
     Inn off Interstate 85 outside Boise, Idaho. He also hands him a 
     picture of his mom.
     
     Mike and Scott wore sunglasses as they journeyed onward to the 
     Blue Room, Scott driving the motorcycle and Mike riding on the 
     back.
     
     Night time exterior of the Holiday Inn.
     
     Mike and Scott pull up on the motorcycle and park it.
     
     Inside the Holiday Inn.
     
     A hostess is standing in front of a sign that bills "Shecky 
     Crude" as the featured entertainer of the evening in the "Blue 
     Room."
     
     Mike is speaking to the hostess. He shows her his picture of mom.
     
                         MIKE
               My mother works here. Her name is 
               Dorothy.
     
                         HOSTESS
               (thinks for a second)
               No. I can't think of anyone by that 
               name. Let me get the manager.
     
     The hostess picks up the phone.
     
     Manager's office night.
     
     A MANAGER is sitting behind his desk wearing a shiny blue suit, 
     he shifts in his swiveling chair, and looks at the Holiday Inn 
     Postcard that Mike's mother sent to his father.
     
                         MANAGER
               Dorothy, Dorothy   There was a 
               Dorothy Biondi used to work here a 
               year ago, but she split. Saved up 
               all her money and headed to Italy.
     
                         MIKE
               To Italy?
     
                         MANAGER
               Yeah. It took her forever to save 
               any cash, but she did, and flew 
               away. She was looking for her 
               family. I guess she came from 
               Italy. But she didn't look 
               Italian.
     
                         SCOTT
               Was your mom Italian?
     
                         MIKE
               I don't know.   I guess that she 
               was.
     
     In the lobby of the Holiday Inn at night.
     
     Mike and Scott witness the arrival of the German Mercedes Benz 
     parts salesman.
     
                         SCOTT
               There's that guy.
     
                         MIKE
               Who?
     
                         SCOTT
               The guy who gave us a ride from 
               Portland. What's he doing here?
     
     Scott and Mike walk up to him. HANS turns and a broad smile 
     crosses his face.
     
                         HANS
               Mike! Scottie! How good to run 
               into you! My dear boys! How have 
               you been?

     Inside Hans' hotel bathroom. Night.
     
     Mike lies in a bathtub in sudsy water. There is a pounding on the 
     bathroom door.
     
                         MIKE
               I just got in the tub! Wait your 
               turn.
     
                         HANS
               But Mike! Don't you want anything 
               to eat? We are ordering room 
               service. Ya?
     
                         MIKE
               Ahhh.  Room service?  Ya!  Let me 
               see. Two hamburgers, with cheese, 
               onions, lettuce, tomato, no 
               pickles. A Coke and french fries.

                         HANS
               O.K. That's hamburger wiz 
               everything, no pickles, Coke, 
               french fries.
     
                         MIKE
               That is correct.
     
                         HANS
               Thank you.
     
                         MIKE
               You're welcome.
     
     As Mike and Scott eat their hamburgers, Hans sits across from 
     them next to a small desk light on a double bed in his Holiday 
     Inn room.
     
                         HANS
               How are the hamburgers, boys?
     
                         MIKE
               They're okay, Hans.
     
                         SCOTT
               Good, Hans. I don't think that 
               I've tasted a hamburger as fine as 
               this Holiday Inn hamburger.
     
                         HANS
               I'm glad that you like it.
     
     The boys eat approvingly.
     
                         HANS
               How did you boys get so far? I 
               only left you in Portland a few 
               days ago.

                         SCOTT
               We rode on our trusty motorcycle.
     
                         HANS
               And what brings you to the Holiday 
               Inn?
     
                         SCOTT
               Business.
     
                         HANS
               What kind of business?
     
                         SCOTT
               We're selling motorcycles.
     
     Still images of Mike, Scott and Hans having sex in the motel.
     
     Hans rides his newly purchased motorcycle across the plains from 
     Boise to Picabu, Idaho. A local policeman pulls him over doing 95 
     mph in a 45 mph zone.
     
     At the Boise Airport Scott and Mike stand in a ticket line. The 
     ticket taker stamps their tickets.
     
                         TICKET TAKER
               Do you have any baggage?
     
     Mike and Scott shake their heads no.

     ItaliA
     
     Mike wakes up and finds himself sitting beside the Trevi fountain 
     in Rome. There are other street kids surrounding him fishing for 
     coins that tourists have thrown in the fountain. He doesn't see 
     Scott.
     He looks around a bit.
     
                         SCOTT (o.s.)
               Mikey! Over here!
     
     Mike's VIEW of Scott in a taxi cab.
     
     The TAXI pulls up to a small farmhouse on a hill outside of Rome. 
     Mike and Scott get out and walk around the house. A farmer is 
     cutting his crop on the next hillside.
     
     A DOG walks up to them.
     
     The taxi driver gets out of the car and asks for his money in 
     Italian. Scott holds out the money that he has and the driver 
     takes it, counting it out for himself.
     
     Mike walks around a corner of the house and notices the doors are 
     open as the cab drives off down the drive.
     
     Scott sits down on the stoop in front of a shack and Mike steps 
     into the house.
     
                         MIKE
               Mom?............Hello?
     
     An extremely Beautiful Italian girl walks around the corner where 
     Scott is sitting. He can't see her. And she leans against the 
     shack and stares at him, then looks up at Mike, who is walking 
     through the house trying to find someone.
     
                         GIRL
               Hello.
     
                         SCOTT
               Hi. Is this your house?
     
     The girl is a little shy and leans on the shack.
     
                         GIRL
               No. This isn't my house, but. It 
               is my uncle's house.
     
                         SCOTT
               I'm Scott.
     
                         GIRL
               I'm Carmella.
     
                         SCOTT
               And he is Mike. We came from 
               America to find his mother.
     
                         CARMELLA
               Oh. An American woman?
     
                         SCOTT
               Yeah, do you know her?
     
                         CARMELLA
               Yes, but. It is not true that she 
               lives here..
     
                         SCOTT
               It isn't true?
     
                         CARMELLA
               No. She left a long time ago. Back 
               to America.
     
                         SCOTT
               Oh, shit.  Was she your friend?
     
                         CARMELLA
               I wanted to speak English, and she 
               taught it to me.
     
     Scott looks up at her, a little surprised.
     
     Mike walks from the house to Scott and Carmella.
     
                         CARMELLA
               Hello. My name is Carmella.
     
                         MIKE
               I'm Mike.
     
                         CARMELLA
               Hello Mike.
     
                         SCOTT
               She knows your mom.
     
     Later in the afternoon, Mike is inside of a room in the house, 
     and he is crying. He is talking to Scottie, who is holding him.
     
                         MIKE
               I mean, Christ, we come all this 
               fuckin' way and she ain't here 
               either. Where'd she go from here?
     
     Mike walks through the rooms of the Italian country
     
     MIKE'S VIEW of a room, and Scott is just closing the door. He 
     winks at Mike as he shuts it.
     
     Inside the room, Carmella and Scott lay down on the bed and kiss.
     
     Scott takes off his clothes and ravishes Carmella, tearing at her 
     dress.
     
     Carmella is naked and the two grab and twist with each other on 
     the white bed.
     
     Still views of the lovemaking.
     
     Mike in the country, watching the farmer in the field.
     
     Mike approaches the house and there is a taxi cab waiting. 
     Carmella is putting a suitcase in the trunk.
     
     Scott helps Carmella in the front seat of the taxi.
     
                         SCOTT
               Hey, Mike. Let me talk with you 
               for a second.
     
     Scott follows Mike inside the house and into a room.
     
                         SCOTT
               I'm gonna take some time off.
     
     Scott gives Mike an American Express card.
     
                         SCOTT
               Don't leave home without it. Ha-
               ha. (Mike doesn't think it's 
               funny)
               I mean, maybe I'll run into you 
     down           the road.
     
     Mike is shocked but sees what Scott needs to do as he looks out 
     the window and can see Carmella in the taxi.
     
                         MIKE
               Yeah, sure. Okay.
     
                         SCOTT
               Sorry about this, dude.
     
                         MIKE
               I'll be okay. Don't worry about 
               me.
     
                         SCOTT
               Sorry, but....
     
                         MIKE
               No, man, forget it. Hurry up, 
               she's waiting, you're gonna lose 
               her.
     
     Mike hides a tear.
     
                         SCOTT
               All right. You sure you'll be 
               okay?

                         MIKE
               Go on, get out of here.
     
     Outside, a dog watches the taxi leave down a rutted dirt drive.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
               Well. So much for the great 
               protector-of-us-all. Protector of 
               himself, more like. I couldn't 
               believe Scott would leave me here 
               in the middle of a foreign 
               country.
     
     Inside, Mike goes into one of his fits, snorting, a little like a 
     pig, and falls asleep.

     Mike wakes up in an airline's passenger seat. A STEWARDESS is 
     leaning over him.
     
                         STEWARDESS
               Wake up. Wake up, we're here.
     
                         MIKE
               Where? Where am I?
     
                         STEWARDESS
               You're in Portland.

     sits and chain smokes cigarettes, there are three other UNKNOWNS 
     around the table.
     
                         MIKE
               And so, I was back in Portland, 
               enjoying the life I used to lead. 
               It was like I was back from a 
               vacation. Denise had a boyfriend 
               now....

     BROADWAY CAFE day.
     
     Mike is at the table again, smoking a cigarette.
     
     There are three new kids who look very MEAN, and are hassling 
     another kid, pulling his collar and throwing him around.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               And there were new kids who were 
               coming around who wanted to take 
               your money. It was a dark period 
               for the streets. Normally, Scott 
               would keep order In the Broadway 
               Cafe.

               Gary and Ray both got work at 
               stands. It was funny...
     
     Int. Deli day.
     
     Ray serves Mike a hot dog.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               ( they both sold hot dogs. Which 
               is what they were used to selling 
               on the streets in the old days. 
               These guys had really changed, I 
               thought.

     Jakes restaurant night.
     
     Mike wakes up.  He is sitting next to Bob and Budd. A new friend, 
     a colorfully dressed man named BAD GEORGE, who looks like a 
     street minstrel, talks on the street in front of a fancy 
     restaurant.  Bad George is obnoxiously yelling in Bob's face.
     
                         BAD GEORGE
               Bob! What tidings I bring you. And 
               such joy. Some of that old rot gut 
               that you and I used to drink. I 
               have three bottles stashed in the 
               bushes out on eighty-second.
     
                         BOB
               What blew you in?
     
                         BAD GEORGE
               Think of the fun we can have, if 
               we could only rind a ride for a 
               journey to the bushes where the 
               hooch is hid.
     
                         BOB
               If I shared your wine, I might 
               catch this awful disease you 
               appear to have. My clothes would 
               turn striped, and I would suddenly 
               have bells on my toes, like this 
               here...
     
     Bob points to George's bells on his shoes.
     
                         BAD GEORGE
               Bob, you're one of the greatest 
               living men on Three-street.
     
                         BOB
               That is correct.
     
                         BAD GEORGE
               Surely you can find us a ride 
               somewhere.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
               As I listened to Bad George and 
               Bob talk, I watched across the 
               street as a long black car pulled 
               up alongside one of the fancier 
               restaurant/bar establishments of 
               Portland. And who got out of that 
               car? It was the old protector-of-
               us-all, himself Scottie Favor.
     
     Bob notices the group of men getting out of a car in front of the 
     restaurant. One of them is Scottie , in a three pieced suit. He 
     is with his Italian girlfriend.
     
                         BOB
               If it isn't Scottie Favor himself. 
               Blessed are they who have been my 
               close friends. Now dressed in a 
               three pieced suit and looking 
               every bit a gentleman! He has run 
               into his inheritance.
     
                         BAD GEORGE
               Who?
     
                         BOB
               George, Budd, Mike. We have waited 
               for this day to come.
     
     Bob charges in the direction of Scottie and his friends.
     
     I nt. Jakes. Night.
     
     Scottie and his associates, who are men much older than he, 
     perhaps in their thirties, make their way through the yuppie 
     crowd standing in the bar drinking. Hellos and how-do-you-do's 
     are directed at Scottie. A man stops Scott on his way through the 
     crowd.
     
                         MAN
               Scottie! I haven't seen you in a 
               dog's age. You're looking well. So 
               grown up. Scottie, I'd like you to 
               meet Ed Warren, he's in marketing 
               at Nike. Ed, this is Scottie 
               Favor.
     
                         ED
               Oh, Jack Favor's son, hello, 
               pleased to meet you.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               How do you do?
     
     Bob is following Scottie through the crowd. Scottie walks past 
     Hans, who is having a drink with another man. They recognize each 
     other but neither speak.
     
     Bob, with Bad George in tow, straightens himself up as the yuppie 
     crowd looks on disapprovingly. Their smelly clothing betrays 
     them.
     
                         BOB
               Come, George, watch this. You will 
               see the attention that I get.
     
     Bob looks at his clothes. A bouncer spots them.
     
                         BOB
               It's true we're drawing attention 
               to ourselves. But Scottie will see 
               that I am dying to see him, and it 
               won't matter how we're dressed.
     
     Scotty and his friends are sitting around a crowded table. As 
     they take their seats, Scottie hears Bob bellowing.

                         BOB
               God save you! God save you, my 
               sweet boy.
     
     Scotty turns away from Bob, so his back is to him.
     
                         BOB
               Sonny! My true friend!
     
     Silence for a second, the crowd grows quieter.
     
                         BOB
               I mean you, Sonny! It's me, Bob!

     Without turning toward Bob, Scottie speaks.
     
                         SCOTT
               I don't know you, old man.
     
                         GIRL IN CROWD
               Who is that bum?
     
     Scottie turns and meets Bob, who kneels next to him.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               Please leave me alone.
     
     Bob is thinking that Scottie's attitude is a joke.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               Don't think that I'm the same 
               Scottie that I was before. 
               Everyone has noticed that I have 
               turned away from that life, and 
               the people who kept me company.

     Bob is shocked.
     
     Outside, Mike can see through the windows of the restaurant, Bob 
     and Scottie talking.
     
     Int. Jakes. night.
     
                         SCOTTIE
               When I was young, and you were my 
               street tutor. An instigator for my 
               bad behavior, I was trying to 
               change. Now that I have, and until 
               I change back   don't come near 
               me.

     Bob feels the rejection like a shock. Stares at Scott for a 
     second, then he's pulled away by the bouncer.
     
     Ext. Jakes. night.
     
     Mike watches Bob and Budd sit down with him.
     
                         BUDD
               Don't take all this seriously. 
               It's one of his jokes.

     He is having nightmares, and suddenly he CRIES OUT'
     
                         BOB
               God, God.... God!
     
     Dawn views of the city
     
     Mike awakes atop a downtown building.
     
     Inside the Derelict Hotel Day.
     
     Mike enters, and walks through a very quiet, although crowded 
     MAIN ENTRANCE. There is a body on a slab in the middle of the 
     room that is covered with a sheet.
     
                         MIKE
               Pigeon?
     
                         A BOY
               Scottie Favor broke his heart.
     
                         GARY
               He's gone now, either to Heaven or 
     to Hell.
     
                         JANE LIGHTWORK
               Be sure it isn't to Hell. He tried 
               to be an honest sort. I'm the one 
               who heard him cry out last night. 
               He said God, God, God... three or 
               four times. And when I got there I 
               put my hand into the bed and felt 
               his feet. And they were cold as 
               stone. And I checked the rest of 
               his body. And it too was as cold 
               as stone.

                         BUDD 
               (crying)
               It sure is quiet.
     
     Mike approaches Budd.
     
                         MIKE
               I guess you're gonna miss him the 
               most, Budd.
     
     Mike gives him Scottie's American Express card, as others carry 
     his body out of the hotel.

                         MIKE
               Here. Maybe you can give him a 
               good burial.
     
     Budd cries.
     
     Mike exits.
     
     In the country, Mike looks at the road.
     
     He has visions of sagebrush and rock flying into the air as if 
     picked up by a big wind.
     
     Then he lies asleep by the side of the road.
     
                         MIKE'S VOICE
               I suppose that a lot of kids like 
               me think that they have no home, 
               that home is a place where you 
               have a mom and a dad.
     
     Pause.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               But home can be any place that you 
               want. Or wherever you can find   
               My home is right here on the side 
               of this road, that I been to 
               before. I just know I been on this 
               fucking road one time before, you 
               know that?

     Later, a car drives by Mike's sleeping body by the side of the 
     road. It turns around and stops next to Mike. A figure puts Mike 
     in his car and drives off down the road.
     
                         MIKE'S THOUGHTS
               Sometimes I had thought that God 
               had not smiled on me, and had 
               given me a bum deal. And other 
               times, I had thought that God had 
               smiled on me. Like now. He was 
               smiling on me... for the time 
               being....
     
     Int. Car. Day.
     
     Scott is driving the car. He looks over at Mike sleeping.
     
     Ext. Desert. Day.
     
     The car disappears down the road.
