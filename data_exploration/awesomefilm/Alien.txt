     Suddenly the transmission is deafening.

     All members of the party shouting into their voice-amps.

               Some kind of spaceship.

     Dallas shuts off his receiver.







     Sudden quiet.







     A long moment.

     Over the speakers Dallas' voice fades in.

     They move into a high-ceilinged chamber.







     Walls covered with shadowy lattices.







     Ghostly light filters dust-filled air.







     A few meters in an opening appears.







     Dallas leans over and looks into the hole.







     Only blackness.







     He unclips the light from his belt.







     Shines it down into the hole.







  







                              DALLAS







               It just goes down... smooth walls.







               I can't see the bottom, light







               won't reach.







              







     Kane and Lambert come over.







     Dallas begins unclipping gear from his belt.

               Let's take a look around here







               first.







              







     Kane and Lambert exchange a glance.







     Dallas shines his light about, sees...







     A large, glossy urn, tan coloration.







     Round opening at the rop, empty within.







     Then Dallas shines his light on nearby lattice...







     Moves closer.







  







                              DALLAS







               Over here.







              







     They approach.  







     Train their lights along the floor.







     A machine.







     On the mechanism, a small bar moves steadily back







     and forth.







     Sliding noiselessly in the grooves.















                              KANE

               Aye aye.







              







     Dallas rigs a tripod over the opening in the floor.







     Unspools a couple of feet of wire.







     Kane attaches the end of it to his chest unit.







     Climbs over the lip and drops it into the hole.







     Now hanging by the wire...







     Head and shoulders out of the opening.







     Kane activates the climbing unit.







     Lowers himself into the fissure.

     Kane braces his feet against the wall of the vertical shaft.







     Switches on his light, points it into the depths.







     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in







     darkness.















                              KANE







               Hotter in here.  Warm air rising







               from below.







  







     He starts down, playing out the line.







     Descending in short leaps.







     Stops to catch his breath.







     Breathing rasping loudly in his helmet.







     A little sunlight filters from above.







     Looking up, Kane can see the mouth of the hole...







     A glowing spot of light.

               This is work.  Can't talk now.







              







     He kicks off and continues down.







     Taking longer and longer hops as he gains confidence.







     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the







     light on his instruments.







  







                              KANE







               I'm below ground level.

     Ripley looks steadily at Ash on her monitor.







     His screen, not visible to her, shows blowup of helmeted,







     skeletal head.  Not human.

     Kane resumes his downward climb.







     Suddenly, his feet lose their purchase as the walls of the







     shaft disappear.







     The tunnel has reached its end.







     Below him is a dark, cavernous space.







     Deep breaths due to his violent exertion.

     Now Kane is dangling free in darkness.







     Spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.







     Then his feet hit bottom.







     Kane grunts in surprise, almost loses his balance.







     He flashes his suit lights.







     The beams reveal that he is in a large hold.







     Row after row of extrusions stretch from floor to ceiling.

               me.







              







     Dallas begins to fiddle with the wench mechanism.















                              DALLAS







               The line's slack.















     Pause.















                              LAMBERT







               He doesn't answer.







                      (pause)







               Do you think he could have unhooked







               himself.







     







     Dallas switches on the winch motor.







     With a whine, it begins to reel the line in.







     After a moment the line tightens with a jerk.







     The motor slows, laboring under added weight.







  







                              DALLAS







               It caught.







              







                              LAMBERT







               Is it hooked on something.







              







                              DALLAS







               No, it's coming.







              







                              LAMBERT







               I can't see anything.







              







     Dallas shines his light down into the hole.







     Shakes his head.















                              DALLAS







               Line's still moving.















     A long moment.







     Dallas shines his light again.







  







                              DALLAS







               Here he comes.







                   







     The winch labors heavily.







  







                              DALLAS







               Get ready to grab him.







              







     Kane appears at the top of the opening.







     Dangles limply from the wire.







     Dallas reaches for him, then recoils.







  







                              DALLAS







               Look out.  There's something on







               his face.







              







     Lambert attempts to help.







  







                              LAMBERT







               What is it.







              







     Kane appears to be completely unconscious.







     The life form is still wrapped motionless around his face.







  







                              LAMBERT







               Oh Jesus.







              







                              DALLAS







               Don't touch it.







              







     They grapple with Kane's limp body.







     Lift him from the hole.

     Suddenly:







  







                              ASH







               We've got them.  They're back

     Ripley stares at the screen.















                              ASH







               I'll go.

     Dallas appears as a huge image on all screens.







     Lambert behind him.







     Kane pinioned to Dallas.

                              RIPLEY

                              RIPLEY







               What happened to Kane.  I need







               a clear definition.







              







                              DALLAS







                      (voice over)

                             RIPLEY







               If we let it in, the ship could

               We're already broken every rule

                              RIPLEY







               I can't.  If you were in my

     Ash hits the emergency switch.

     Servo whine.







     Followed by a solid metallic chunk.

     The servo again turns over.







     Another clunk.







     The outer door has closed.







     Red light off.

     Dallas and Lambert stagger into passageway.







     Carry Kane's body between them.







     Dallas pulls off his helmet.

                              LAMBERT







               I don't know, but don't touch it.















                              DALLAS







               Take him to the infirmary.















                              BRETT







               Right.















     Ash and Brett move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

     Kane's helmet.







     Hands begin to open it with a laser cutter.







     The helmet separates easily.







     The two halves part...







     ...The life form slowly pulsing on Kane's face.







     Dallas hesitates, then puts his hand on the small Creature.







     Tries to pull it free.







     Unsuccessful.







     The Alien remains anchored to Kane's tissue.















                              ASH







               Let me try.















     Ash takes a pair of pliers from a rack.







     Carefully grasps the tip of the Creature.







     Squeezes tightly.







     Leans back.







  







                              DALLAS







               You're tearing his face.







              







     A trickle of blood appears on Kane's cheek.







  







                              BRETT







               It's not going to come off without







               pulling his whole faceoff at the

                              DALLAS







               Let the machine work on him.







              







     The Ash presses a switch.







     The machine lights up.







     Kane is sucked into a slot on the wall.







     Visible inside through the glass layer.







     A blinding colored light performs antisepsis.

     Ripley appears.







     Dallas turns and looks at her.







     A long moment.















                              DALLAS







               When I give an order, I expect







               it to be obeyed.















                              RIPLEY







               Even if it's against the law.















                              DALLAS







               That's right.















     Lambert steps forward and slaps Ripley across the face.







     Ripley slowly puts her hand to her cheek.















                              LAMBERT







               You were going to leave us out there.















                              PARKER







               Maybe she should have.  Who the







               hell knows what that is.















                              BRETT







               Right.















     Ripley looks at Lambert.







     A moment.















                              RIPLEY







               Let's call it settled.















     Lambert gives her a curt nod.







     Ash turns attention to the instrumentation.















                              RIPLEY







               Somebody fill me in.















                              DALLAS







               He went into the structure alone,







               we lost radio contact.  When we







               pulled him out, it was on his face...















                              ASH







               Where did it come from...















                              DALLAS







               Somewhere inside that ship.















                              PARKER







               How the hell is he breathing.















     They study the monitors.















                              ASH







               Blood's throughly oxygenated.















                              DALLAS







               How.  His nose and mouth seem







               to be blocked.















                              ASH







               We better look inside his head.















     Ash punches three buttons.







     An X-ray image appears.







     A color depiction of Kane's head and upper torso.







     The Alien is clearly visible.







     A maze of complicated biology.







     Kane's jaws are forced open.







     The creature has extruded a long tube down his mouth and







     throat.







     The appendage ending at the base of the esophagus.







  







                              BRETT  







               It's got something down his goddamn







               throat.















                              ASH







               That must be how it's getting







               oxygen to him.















                              RIPLEY







               It doesn't make sense.  It paralyzes







               him, puts him into a coma, then







               keeps him alive.















                              PARKER







               Let's kill it.  We can't leave the







               damn thing on him.















                              ASH







               I don't know.  At the moment the







               Creature is keeping him alive.







               If we remove it we might







               terminate Kane...







  







                              DALLAS







               I don't think so.  Let's take the







               chance and cut it off him.







  







                              ASH







               You'll take the responsibility.







  







                              DALLAS







               That's right.















     Slips into surgical gloves.







     Presses a switch, Kane slides back out of the booth.















                              DALLAS







               Give me the knife.







              







     Ripley takes a surgical laser blade from the case.







     Carefully passes it to Dallas.







     He manipulates the knife until he has a comfortable grip.







     Flicks a small button with his thumb.







     The blade begins to hum.







     Dallas advances on Kane's prostrate form.







     Touches the scalpel to the Creature.







     The electronic blade slices effortlessly downward.







     Suddenly a urine-like fluid begins to drip from the wound.







  







                              DALLAS







               Starting to bleed.







  







     The liquid flows onto the bedding next to Kane's head.







     Starts to hiss.







     Smoke curls up from the stain.







     Next the yellow fluid eats a hole through the bunk bed.







     Then drips onto the deck below.







     Metal bubbling and sizzling.







     More smoke rising, sending the crew into a coughing jag.







     The crew jostle their way out of the cabin.







     Huddle in the passageway outside, still coughing.







     Dallas frantically applies pressure to the wound.







     In the process, smoke of the fluid gets on Dallas's gloves.







     They begin to smoke.







     Dallas leaps back, pulls them off.







     Then runs out into the corridor.

               Shit.  It's going to eat through







               the decks and go out the hull...







              







     He starta to run for the companionway.

     Dallas wrenches an emergency lamp from a socket.







     Hurls himself down a companionway.







     The others follow.







  







                              DALLAS







               There.







  







     A droplet of fluid is sizzling on the ceiling bulkhead.







     It oozes down.







     Drips to the deck.







     Continues to bubble.







     Then goes through the bulkhead.







  







                              ASH







               What can we put under it.

     Dallas, Brett and Ash crouch by the spot where the acid







     sizzles.







     Ash fishes a pen out of his pocket.







     Probes the hole in the deck.







  







                              ASH







               It's stopped penetrating.







  







     Ripley comes charging back up.              







     







                              RIPLEY







               What's happening.















                              ASH







               I think it's lost steam.  No







               longer active.















     Ripley checks the opening.







     Ash straightens up.







     Starts to put the pen back in his pocket.







     Changes his mind and stands holding it by the end.







  







                              ASH







               I've never seen anything like that,

                              BRETT







               This thing uses it for blood.







  







                              ASH







               It's the asbestos that stopped it,







               otherwise it would have gone straight







               through.















                              DALLAS







               Wonderful defense mechanism.







               You don't dare kill it.







              







     Parker comes up the companionway.















                              PARKER







               It's stopped bleeding.

               again.  It didn't work out too well







               last time.







  







     Dallas gives him a look in return.







     Ripley presses a button.







     Kane slides back into the diagnostic coffin.

     The machine begins to process Kane's body.















                              RIPLEY







               What's the stain on his lungs.















     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the chest cavity.







     At the center, the stain is completely opaque.















                              ASH







               Whatever it is, it's blocking

               Do you hurt.







  







                              KANE







               All over.  Feel like somebody's







               been beating me with a stick







               for about six years.







                      (smiles)







               God, I'm hungry.















                              RIPLEY







               What's the last thing you can







               remember.















                              KANE







               I don't know.















                              DALLAS







               Do you remember what happened







               on the planet.















                              KANE







               Just some horrible dream              







               about smothering.  Where







               are we.















                              RIPLEY







               We're on our way home.







              







                              BRETT







               Getting ready to go back into







               the freezers.







  







                              KANE







               I'm starving.  I want some food







               first.







  







                              PARKER







               I'm pretty hungry myself.







  







                              DALLAS







               One meal before bed.







                                                           







     INT. MESS                                         117







  







     The entire crew is seated.







     Hungrily swallowing huge portions of artificial food.







     The cat eats from a dish on the table.







  







                              KANE







               First thing I'm going to do when







               we get back is eat some decent







               food.







  







                              PARKER







               I've had worse than this, but







               I've had better too, if you know







               what I mean.







  







                              LAMBERT







               Christ, you're pounding down this







               stuff like there's no tomorrow.















     Pause.







  







                              PARKER







               I mean I like it.







  







                              KANE







               No kidding.







  







                              PARKER







               Yeah.  It grows on you.







  







                              KANE







               It should.  You know what they







               make this stuff out of...







  







                              PARKER







               I know what they make it out of.







               So what.  It's food now.  You're







               eating it.







              







     Suddenly Kane grimaces.







  







                              RIPLEY







               What's wrong.







              







     Kane's voice strains.







  







                              LAMBERT







               What's the matter.







  







                              KANE







               I don't know... I'm getting cramps.







              







     The others stare at him in alarm.







     Suddenly he makes a loud groaning noise.







     Clutches the edge of the table with his hands.







     Knuckles whitening.







  







                              ASH







               Breathe deeply.







  







     Kane screams.







  







                              KANE







               Oh God, it hurts so bad.







               It hurts.  It hurts.







                      (stands up)







               Ooooooh.







  







                              BRETT







               What is it.  What hurts.







              







     Kane's face screws into a mask of agony.







     He falls back into his chair.







  







                              KANE







               Ohmygooaaaahh.







              







     A red stain.







     Then a smear of blood blossoms on his chest.







  







     The fabric of his shirt is ripped apart.







     A small head the size of a man's fist pushes out.







  







     The crew shouts in panic.







     Leap back from the table.







     The cat spits, bolts away.







  







     The tiny head lunges forward.







     Comes spurting out of Kane's chest trailing a thick body.







     Splatters fluids and blood in its wake.







     Lands in the middle of the dishes and food.







     Wriggles away while the crew scatters.







     Then the Alien being disappears from sight.







  







     Kane lies slumped in his chair.







     Very dead.







     A huge hole in his chest.







     The dishes are scattered.







     Food covered with blood.







  







                              LAMBERT







               No, no, no, no, no.







              







                              BRETT







               What was that.  What the Christ







               was that.















                              PARKER







               It was growing in him the whole







               time and he didn't even know it.















                              ASH







               It used him for an incubator.















                              RIPLEY







               That means we've got another







               one.















                              DALLAS







               Yeah.  And it's loose on the







               ship.















     Slowly they gather around Kane's gutted corpse.







     Then they all look at one another.







     Then at Kane.







     Dead on the table.







  







     INT. CORRIDOR - "A" DECK                              118















     Empty.  







     Parker and Brett descend companioway.







     They join Ash, Lambert, Ripley and Dallas.















                              DALLAS







               Any signs.















                              LAMBERT







               Nothing.















                              ASH







               Nothing.















                              PARKER







               Didn't see a goddamn thing.















                              BRETT







               Didn't see anything.















                              RIPLEY







               We can't go into hypersleep with







               that thing running loose.  We'd







               be sitting ducks in the freezers.







               We have to kill it first.















                              LAMBERT







               We can't kill it.  If we do, it







               will spill its body acids right







               through the hull...















                              BRETT







               Son-of-a-bitch.















                              RIPLEY







               We have to catch it and eject







               it from the ship.















                              ASH







               Our supplies are based on us







               spending a limited amount of







               time out of suspended animation.







               Strictly limited.















                              RIPLEY







               First we have to find it.















                              DALLAS







               No.  First we've got something







               else to do.















     He looks at Kane's body through mess doorway.

     The crew looking at Kane's body on view screens.







     Silent.







     Depressed.







  







                              DALLAS







               Inner hatch sealed.







              







     Ripley nods.







  







                              DALLAS







               Anybody want to say anything.







              







     Nothing to say.







     He nods to Ripley.







     She presses a button.

     Yawning space outside.







     Kane's body shoots out into eternity.







     The hatch closes.







  







     INT. MESS                                         122







  







     The crew is assembled.  







     







                              RIPLEY  







               I've checked on the supplies.







               For about a week we can stay







               out of hypersleep.















                              BRETT







               Then what.















                              LAMBERT







               We run out of food and oxygen.















                              DALLAS







               All right, that's what we've got.







               A week.  It's plenty of time.















                              PARKER







               I say we put on our pressure







               suits and blow all the air out







               of the ship.  That might kill it.















                              LAMBERT







               What a swell idea.















                              PARKER







               What's wrong with it.















                              ASH







               We've got forty-eight hours of







               air in our pressure suits and







               it takes six months to get home.















                              LAMBERT







               Other than that...A swell idea.















     Parker won't give up on this idea.















                              PARKER







               Maybe we could out some kind







               of special lines to the tanks.







               Brett and I are pretty good







               practical engineers...We got







               us back up you know.















                              RIPLEY







               All by yourselves.















                              ASH







               I hate to point this out but







               it might be better off without







               oxygen.  It lived that way long







               enough.















                              RIPLEY







               There's another problem.  How







               do we find it.  There's no







               visual communication on B and







               C decks.  All the screens are







               out.















                              DALLAS







               We're going to have to flush it







               out.







  







                              ASH







               Sounds great...but how.







  







                              DALLAS







               Room by room, corridor by corridor.















     One of those suggestions that nobody likes.







  







                              LAMBERT







               And what do we do when we find it.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Trap it somehow.







  







                              BRETT







               If we had a really strong piece







               of net, we could bag it... I could







               put something together.  A long







               metal rod with a battery in it.







               Only take a few hours.















                              LAMBERT







               Why do we listen to this meathead.















     Dallas turns it over.















                              DALLAS







               He might be right...

               I'm a little busy at the

               I don't care.







                                                           







     Pause.

               All right, go ahead.







  







                              DALLAS







               Why did you let the Alien survive







               inside Kane.







  







                              ASH







               I'm not sure you're getting







               through to me.

               Mother was monitoring his body.







               You were monitoring Mother.  You







               must have had some idea of what







               was going on.







  







                              ASH







               What are you trying to say.







              







     A long moment.







  







                              DALLAS







               You want the Alien to stay alive







               ...I figure you have a reason.







  







                              ASH







               Name one.







  







                              DALLAS







               Look, we both work for the same







               company.  I just want to know







               what's going on.







  







                              ASH







               I don't know what the hell you're







               talking about.  And I don't like







               any of the insinuations.  The







               Alien is a dangerous form of







               life...I don't want it to stay







               alive any more than you do.







  







                              DALLAS







               You're sure.







  







                              ASH







               Yeah, I'm sure.  You should be

                              RIPLEY







               We've got an hour...Look I







               need some relief.















                              DALLAS







               Why did you wait until now.















     Ripley leans forward.















                              RIPLEY







               Let me tell you something.  You







               keep staring out there long







               enough, they'll be peeling you







               off the wall.















     Ripley begins taking off her boots.















                              DALLAS







               We're the new pioneers, Ripley.







               We even get to have our own







               special disease.















                              RIPLEY







               I'm tired of talking.















     She rises and removes her upper garments.

               You waited too long.

     INT. BRIDGE                                           126







  







     The crew has assembled.







     Brett unfolds several yards of asbestos netting.







     Hands out five thin rods.







     Each of them like metal broom handles.







  







                              BRETT







               I put portable generators in







               each of these.  They're insulated







               down here.  Just be goddamn careful







               not to get your hand on the end.







              







     He touches the tip to a metal object.







     A blue spark leaps.







  







                              BRETT







               It won't damage the little bastard







               unless its skin is a lot thinner







               than ours...It'll just give it a







               little incentive.







  







                              LAMBERT







               Now if we could only find it.







  







     Ash picks up a portable unit.







  







                              ASH







               I've taken care of that...tracking







               device.  You set it to search for







               a moving object...It hasn't much







               range but when you get within a







               certain distance it starts beeping.







  







     Ripley takes the tracker from Ash's hand.







  







                              RIPLEY







               What's it key on.







  







                              ASH







               Micro changes in air density.







               Keep it pointed ahead of you.







  







                              DALLAS  







               We'll break into two teams.







               Whoever finds it first catches







               it in the net and ejects it







               from the nearest air lock.







                      (pause)







               For starters, let's make sure







               the bridge is safe.















     Parker turns on his unit.







     Scans it around the room.















                              LAMBERT







               We seem to be okay...If this







               damn thing works.















                              DALLAS







               Ash and myself will go with







               Lambert.  Brett and Parker will







               make up the second team.  Ripley,







               you command it.















     They start doling out the equipment.















                              DALLAS







               Channels are open on all decks.







               We'll be in constant touch.

     Lambert and Dallas carry the net.







     Ash walks directly behind, carrying the tracking device.







     He continually scans from side to side.







     Lambert stops by a stairwell.







  







                              LAMBERT







               Anything down there.







  







     INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY - "B" LEVEL                   128







  







     Parker and Ripley move silently along.







     Ripley ahead of them with the tracker by the stairwell.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Nothing.







              







     The move on.







     A small light flashes.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Hold it.  I've got something.







              







     Parker and Brett grow tense.







     Start looking around.







  







                              BRETT







               Where's it coming from.







              







     Ripley peers closely at the tracker.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Machine's screwed up.  I can't







               tell.  Needle's spinning all







               over the dial.







              







                              BRETT







               Goddamn, malfunction.







              







     Ripley turns the tracker on its side.







     The needles stabilize.







  







                              RIPLEY







               No, just confused.  It's







               coming from below us.







              







     They all look down at their feet.







  







     INT. MAINTENANCE - "C" LEVEL                          129







  







     Ripley, Parker and Brett come down ladder onto an endless







     oily corridor.







     They stop at the foot of the companionway...







     They move down corridor into darkness.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Okay.







              







     Looks at the tracker.















     Nods down the passageway.  Stops.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Back this way.







              







     They begin to walk in that direction.







     Entering drab section of the ship.







     Surrounded by deep shadows.







     Footsteps clanging on the metal deck.







  







                              RIPLEY







               I thought you fixed 12 module.







  







                              BRETT







               We did.







  







                              PARKER







               Circuits must have burned out.







              







     They switch on lights.







     Move around two turns.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Wait.







              







     They stop quickly, almost stumbling.







  







                              RIPLEY







               It's within five meters.







              







     Parker and Brett heft the net.







     Ripley has the prod in one hand, tracker in the other.







     Moves with great care.







     Almost in a half-crouch, ready to leap back.







     Prod extended, Ripley constantly glances at her tracker.







     The device leads her up to a small hatch in the bulkhead.







     Perspiration rivers down her face.







     She sets aside the tracker.







     Raises the prod, grasps the hatch handle.







     Yanks it open.







     Jams the electric prod inside.







     A nerve-shattering squall.







     Then a small creature comes flying out of the locker.







     Eyes glaring, claws flashing.







     Instinctively, they throw the net over it.







  







     Very annoyed.







     They open the net and release the captive.







     Which happens to be the cat.







     Hissing and spitting,. it scampers away.







  







                              RIPLEY







               God damn it...hold it.







  







                              PARKER







               We should have killed it...Now







               we might pick it up on the







               tracker again.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Go get it.  We'll go on.







  







                              BRETT







               Right.







              







     Ripley and Parker move down the passageway.







     Brett follows the direction taken by the cat.







     Moves across passageway into equipment maintenance area.







  







     INT. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AREA - "C" LEVEL           130







  







     Brett walking between rows of shadowed equipment.







     Looking for the cat.







     Nervous.







  







                              BRETT







               Jones...Here kitty...Jones...







               Goddamn it Jones.







              







     Scratching noises.







     A reassuring cat yowl.







     Brett moves on.







  







     INT. PASSAGEWAY - "C" LEVEL                           131







  







     Ripley and Parker walk along.







     Tracker signal weakens.







     Finally stops.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Nothing here.







  







                              PARKER







               Let's go back.

     Brett enters.







     Still looking for Jones.







     Another yowl followed by a hiss.







     Two eyes shining in the dark.







     Jones.







     Relieved, Brett moves toward the cat.







  







                              BRETT







               Here kitty...Come on Jones.







              







     Brett reaches for Jones.







     Jones hisses.







     An arm reaches for Brett.







     The Alien.







     Now seven feet tall.







     Hanging from the undercarriage strut in reverse position.







     Grabs Brett and swings up into darkness.







     Brett screams.







     To no avail...







  







     In the doorway Ripley and Parker.







     They witness the horror.

                              LAMBERT  







               Now what.















                              PARKER







               Blast the rotten bastard with







               a laser and take our chances.







  







                              RIPLEY







               No.  At its present size it's  







               holding enough acid to tear a







               hole in this ship as big as this







               room.







  







                              ASH







               It wouldn't do any good.  It's







               self-regenerating.  You saw that







               when we operated on it.







  







                              RIPLEY  







               The only plan that's going to







               work is the same one we had







               before.  Drive it into an air







               lock and blow it out into space.















                              PARKER







               Drive it...The son-of-a-bitch







               is huge.















                              LAMBERT







               For once he has a point.  How







               do we drive it.







  







                              RIPLEY







               The science department should







               be able to help...















                              ASH







               According to Mother, he's a







               primitive form of encephlepod...















                              LAMBERT







               How come it's a he.















                              ASH







               Just a phrase.  As a matter of







               fact he's both, bisexual or







               hermaphrodite to be precise.















                              DALLAS







               Skip its sex life.  How do







               we kill it.







  







                              ASH







               It seems to have adapted to







               an oxygen-rich atmosphere and







               it's certainly adapted well for







               its nutritional requirements.







               The only thing we don't know







               about is temperature.















                              RIPLEY







               Curious isn't it...That the







               Alien is an encephlepod...















                              ASH







               What's so curious about that.















                              RIPLEY







               It's curious because lower







               species can't adapt as quickly







               as higher ones.  And this one's







               doing very well.  A real survivor.







               Might even have as good a chance







               as we do.















                              ASH







               You're getting paranoid again.















                              RIPLEY







               All right.  What about the







               temperature.  What happens







               if we change it.







  







                              ASH







               Let's give it a try.  Most







               animals retreat from fire.















     Puase.















                              PARKER







               I can hook up a couple of

               your way through the maze and







               hope it's afraid of fire.















                              DALLAS







               Well Parker, you wanted an







               equal share...















                              PARKER







               Yeah.















                              DALLAS







               Get in the pipe.















                              PARKER







               Why me.















                              DALLAS







               I just wanted to see you get







               your full share.















                              PARKER







               No way.















                              RIPLEY







               I'll go.















                              DALLAS







               Forget it.  You take the







               air lock.  Parker and Lambert







               cover the exit.























     No doubt as to who's going inside the vent.

     Ripley stands in vestibule.







     Looks through the Bulkhead door to air lock.







     She throws a switch.







     Watches airshaft entrance into air lock open.







     The trap is ready.

     Ash hands Dallas the makeshift flamethrower.







     He fires a couple of short bursts.















                              DALLAS







               It's still working.















                              ASH







               Why do you have to go.  Why







               didn't you sent Ripley.















                              DALLAS







               It's my responsibility.  I let







               Kane go into the craft.  Now







               it's my turn.















                              ASH







               You're the captain.  It'll be







               harder on the rest of us, if







               we lose you.















                              DALLAS







               Nothing I do that Ripley can't.















                              ASH







               I don't agree.















                              DALLAS







               The decision is final.















     He removes the master computer key.







     Hands it to Ash.















                              DALLAS







               If I don't take it back,







               Ripley will need this.















     Ash nods.







     Dallas turns and climbs into the ventilator opening.







     Just large enough to crawl through.

     Only a foot or two wider than his shoulders.

     Turns a corner.







     Several more tight turns.







     Instinctively Dallas pulls back.







     Raises the flamethrower.







     Fires a blast around the corner into the darkness.







     It roars loudly in the confined tube.

               out, if it leaves the main shaft.







              







     He throws a switch.







     A metal pane rises and seals off the opening.

               He knows I want to check up on

     Suddenly, from out of nowhere a klaxon wails.







     The Creature leaps back across the threshold of the air lock.







     Bewildered.

               You all right.















                              PARKER







               We didn't get it.  The warning







               went off and it jumped back in







               the ship.















                              ASH







               Who hit the warning.















                              RIPLEY







               You tell me.















                              ASH







               What does that mean.















                              RIPLEY







               I guess the alarm went off by







               itself.















                              ASH







               If you've got something to say

                              RIPLEY







               How much oxygen have we lost.







               I want an exact reading.















                              LAMBERT







               You were accusing him.















                              RIPLEY







               If I could find the command







               computer key, I could prove it.















                              LAMBERT







               You're still accusing him of







               stealing the key.















                              RIPLEY







               You think I'm wrong.















                              LAMBERT







               I don't know.  Wrong or crazy.

     Satidfies it's deserted.







     She puts down the flamethrower.







     Methodically begins to search for the key.







     Faint tapping sound.







     Then stops.







     She looks around.







     Sees nothing.







     Resumes searching near blister window...







     Ripley finds key...







     Tapping sound.







     She whips around to see:







     Kane's disfigured face slapping against the plexiglass.







     She stifles a scream.







     Drops the key onto the curved surface of the blister.







     Fishes for it...







     Kane's bloated face swings in...







     Beneath her.







     She grabs the key and bolts up companionway.















     INT. COMPUTER ANNEX                                   174







  







     Ripley plugs the key into the board.







     Data banks come to life.







     She sits at a console.







     Thinks for a moment.







     Then punches up a code.







     Nothing happens.







     Punches another combination.







     Nothing happens.







     Frustration.







     Another combination.







     One screen comes to life.







     Another combination.







     She moves to the second keyboard.







     Screen One spells out the question:







     Question:  WHO TURNED ON AIR LOCK 2 WARNING SYSTEM.







     Response:  ASH







     Another code.







     Question:  IS ASH PROTECTING THE ALIEN.







     Response:  YES







     New code.







     Question:  WHY







     Response:  SPECIAL ORDER 937 SCIENCE EYE'S ONLY







     She starts a new code.  







     A hand slmas down next to Ripley's arm.







     It sinks elbow deep into the computer.







     She whips around in her chair.







     Faces Ash.







     Ripley lashes out with her foot.







     Kicks him in the middle.







     No effect.







     Ripley twists away.







     Ash throws a punch at her.







     Misses.







     She pushes a chair at him.







     Overturns the desk...







     And runs through bridge into mess.







              







     He moves after her.







     Gets her.     







     Parker and Lambert burst into the Mess.







     Lambert falls on Ash's back.







     Ash turns to Lambert.







     Tosses her across the room.







     Returns to Ripley.







     Again choking her.







     Parker lifts the tracker.







     Steps behind Ash.







     Swings the tracker...Wallop.







     Tears his head off...







     Wires ascending from Ash's trunk.







     Where his head used to be.







     Ash's hands release Ripley.







     Search above his neck for his missing head.







     He walks backward.







     All eyes on Ash's headless body.







     He walks the room.







     Still feeling for his missing head.







  







                              PARKER







               A robot, a God damn Droid.







              







     Ash turns on him.







     Starts to advance.







     Parker hits him again with the tracker...







     Again.







     Again.







     No avail.







     Ash begins choking Parker.







     Ripley picks up one of the prod sticks.







     Closes on Ash's back.







     Tears away the fabric.







     Lambert pulls at Ash's legs.







     Ripley tears at the controls buried in the cavity once







     covered by his head.







     Parker's eyes bulge in pain.







     Ash, headless, choking, choking, choking...







     Ripley finds the wires, stabs the prod home...







     Ash's grip lessens.







     Another stab...electrical flash...







     The grip lessens...







     Another stab...flash of circuits.







     The headless body collapses.







     Parker trying to regain his breath.







  







                              PARKER







               Damn you.







              







     Kicks the headless body.







     Lambert looks at Ripley.







  







                             LAMBERT







               Tell me...What the hell's going on.















     Pause.















                              RIPLEY







               Let's find out.  Wire him back up.















                              PARKER







               What kind of crap is that.















                              RIPLEY







               Do it.















     The set to work.







     Begin to reassemble the wiring in Ash's head.















                              RIPLEY







               Ash let it on board.  Ash let it







               grow inside Kane.  Ash blew the







               warning signal.















                              LAMBERT







               Why.

               That's what I want to know.















     Ash's head is placed on the table.







     His eyes flicker into consciousness.















                              RIPLEY







               What is Special Order 937.















                              ASH







               You know I can't tell you that.















                              RIPLEY







               Then there's not point in talking







               to you.  Pull the plug.







                              







                              ASH







               Special Order 937 in essence







               asked me to direct the ship to







               the planet, investigate a life







               form, possibly hostile and bring







               it back for observation.  With







               discretion, of course.















                              RIPLEY







               Why.  Why not tell us.















                              ASH







               Would you have gone.















                              PARKER







               It wasn't in the contract.















                              ASH







               My very point.















                              RIPLEY







               They wanted to investigate the







               Alien.  No matter what happened







               to us.







                              







                              ASH







               That's unfair.  Actually, you







               weren't mentioned in the order.















                              LAMBERT







               Those bastards.















                              ASH







               See it from their point of view.







               They didn't know what the Alien is.















                              RIPLEY







               How do we kill it.







                              







                              ASH







               I don't think you can.  Not







               in this ship, given its life







               support systems.  But I might







               be able to.















                              RIPLEY







               How.







                              







                              ASH







               I don't know quite yet.  I'm not







               exactly at my best at the moment.







               If you would reconnect...















                              RIPLEY







               No way.







                              







                              ASH







               Don't be so hasty.  You'll never







               kill it without my help.















                              RIPLEY







               We've had enough of your help.







                              







                              ASH







               You've barely got any oxygen left.







               If you don't go into hypersleep,







               you'll die with or without the







               Alien.

               Nice try, Ash.







                              







                              ASH







               I will do whatever I can to help







               you.  I swear it.















                              PARKER







               Pull the plug.















                              LAMBERT







               I agree.















                              ASH







               You idiots.  You stll don't







               realize what you're dealing with.







               The Alien is a prefect organism.







               Superbly structured, cunning,







               quintessentially violent.  With







               your limited capabilities you have







               no chance against it.















                              LAMBERT







               You admire it.















                              ASH







               How can one not admire prefection.







               I will kill it because I am







               programmed to protect human life







               as you know.















                              RIPLEY







               Even if you have contempt for it.







                              







                              ASH







               Even then.















     Bitter and angry.















                              RIPLEY







               Sorry Ash.  I don't buy it.















                              ASH







               You egocentric morons.  You'll







               be ripped to shreds, destroyed







               and...















     Ripley make a movement.







     Ash softens...















                              ASH







               I can only with you well...















     Ripley pulls the plug.















                              PARKER







               He was probably right.  We do







               need him.















                              RIPLEY







               He was conning us.















                              LAMBERT







               He was programmed to protect







               human life.















                              RIPLEY







               He wasn't protecting our human







               lives and that's all I care about.







               Anyway it's done.















     Ripley exits to the bridge.

               He's right about one thing.







               We've got less than twelve







               hours oxygen left.

                              LAMBERT







               I don't know about the rest of







               you, but I think I prefer a







               painless peaceful death to any







               of the alternatives on offer.















                              RIPLEY







               We're not there yet.















     Lambert holds up a small card of spansules.







     Suicide pills.















                              LAMBERT







               We're not.  Huh.















                              RIPLEY







               I think we shuld blow up the







               ship.















                              LAMBERT







               I'll stick with chemicals if







               you don't mind.















                              RIPLEY







               We leave in the shuttle and







               then blow up the ship.

                              PARKER







               That's it.















                              RIPLEY







               Now.  Let's get the food, shut







               off the engines and get out...







               Jones.  Where's Jones.















                              PARKER







               Who knows.















                              LAMBERT







               Last I saw him was in the mess.















                              RIPLEY







               Go look.  We don't want to leave him.















                              LAMBERT







               I don't want to go by myself.















                              PARKER







               Always hated that damn cat.















                              RIPLEY

               Jones.  You're in luck.







              







     As she reaches for him, Jones jumps off the console.







     Moves away.







  







                              RIPLEY







               Come on, Jones.







              







     She moves after the cat.

     Pitch black.







     Ripley arrives at deck level.







     Shines her light.







     Its arc reveals the Alien's layer.







     Bones, shreds of flesh.







     Pieces of clothing, shoes.







     Bizarre extrusions on the wall.















     Something moves in the darkness.







     Ripley spins, turns her light toward the movement.















     Hanging from the ceiling is a huge cocoon.







     Woven from fine, white, silk-like material.







     Falmethrower ready, Ripley approaches.

     Dallas moves his head slightly.







     Ripley turns her light.







     Another cocoon dangles from the ceiling.







     But of a different texture.







     Smaller and darker, with a harder shell.







     Almost exactly like the ovoids in the derelict ship.

                      (o.s.)







               Attention.  Engines will overload







               in two minutes.















     INT. "B" LEVEL - COMPANIONWAY                         198-A















     She reaches companionway.







     Picks up Jones.















     INT. "B" LEVEL - CORRIDOR LEADING TO NARCISSUS        199















     Ripley staggers towards the air lock.







     The Narcissus berthed beyond.







     She drags Jones and raises the flamethrower.







     Turns to see if the Creature is behind her.







     Then advances down the passageway.







     Goaded on by the computer.















                              MOTHER'S VOICE







                      (o.s.)







               Attention.  Engines will explode







               in ninety seconds.















     She makes it to the vestibule.







     Looks into the shuttle.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        200















     Ripley scans the narrow deck...empty.















     INT. VESTIBULE                                        201















     She turns and dashes back.







     Grabs the cat box.







     Runs back toward the shuttle.















                              MOTHER'S VOICE







                      (o.s.)







               Attention.  The engines will

     INT. NARCISSUS                                        202







  







     Ripley enters on the run.







     Hurls the cat box toward the front.







     She dives into the control chair.







     Hits the "launch" button.







  







     EXT. NOSTROMO - OUTER SPACE                           203







  







     The retainer clips drop away.







     A blast of ram jets.







     The shuttle is launched from the mother ship.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS                                        204







  







     Ripley frantically straps herself in.







     G-forces from the shuttles acceleration pulling against her.







  







     EXT. SPACE                                            205







  







     The Narcissus continues to power away from the mother ship.







     The larger bulk of the Nostromo quietly receding.







     All is strangely serene.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS                                        206







  







     Ripley finishes strapping herself in.







     Reaches and grabs the cat box.







     the cat yowling within.







     Ripley hugs the box to her chest.







     Hunches her head down over the container.







  







     EXT. SPACE                                            207







  







     The Nostromo drifts farther away from the shuttle-craft.







     Finally becomes a small point of light.







     Then it blows up.







     Transforms into expanding orange fireball.







     Pieces of metal flying in all directions.







     And then the refinery explodes.







     200,000,000 tons of fuel blasting silently into the cosmos.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS                                        208







  







     The shockwave hits the shuttle craft.







     Jolting and rattling everything within.







     Then all is quiet.







     Ripley unhooks herself from her straps.







     Rises, and goes to the back of the escape craft.







     Stares out through the porthole.







     Face bathed in orange light.







  







     EXT. SPACE                                            209







  







     Piece of debris float past.







     The boiling fireball fades into nothingness.







     The Nostromo has ceased to exist.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS                                        210







  







     Ripley watching the final destiny of her ship and crew mates.







     A very long moment.







  







     Then, behind her, the lethal hand emerges from deep shadow.  







     The Alien has been in the shuttle-craft all along.







     The cat yowls.















     Ripley whils.







     Finding herself facing the Creature.















     Ripley's first thought if for the flamethrower.







     It lies on the deck next to the Alien.







     Next she glances around for a place to hide.







     Her eye falls on a small locker containing a pressure suit.







     The door standing open.







     She begins to edge toward the compartment.







     The Creature stands.







     Comes for her.







     Ripley dives for the open door.







     Hurls herself inside.







     Slams it shut.







  







     INT. LOCKER                                           211















     A clear glass panel in the door.







     The Alien puts its head up to the window.







     Peers in at Ripley.







     Their faces only two inches apart.







     The Alien looking at Ripley almost in curiosity.







     The moaning of the cat distracts it.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        212















     The Alien mvoes to the pressurized cat box.







     Bends down and peers inside.







     The cat yowls louder as his container is lifted.















     INT. LOCKER                                           213















     Ripley knocks on the glass.







     Trying to distract the Creature from the cat.







     The Alien's face is instantly back at the window.







     Getting no more interference from her, the Creature







     returns to the cat box.







     Ripley looks around.







     Sees the pressure suit.







     Quickly begins to pull it on.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        214















     The Alien picks up the cat box.







     Shakes it.







     the cat moans.















     INT. LOCKER                                           215















     Ripley is halfway into a pressure suit.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        216















     The Creature throws the cat box down.







     Very hard.







     Picks it up again.







     Hammers it against the wall.







     Then jams it into a crevice.







     Begins to pound the container into the opening.







     The cat now beyond all hysteria.















     INT. LOCKER                                           217















     Ripley pulls on the helmet, latches it into place.







     Turns the oxygen valve.







     With a hiss, the suit fills itself.







     A rack on the wall contains a long metal rod.







     Ripley peels off the rubber tip.







     Revealing a sharp metal point.















     INT. SPACE SUIT LOCKER                                218















     Ripley inhales.







     Kicks the door open.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        219















     The Creature rises.







     Faces the locker.







     Catches the steel shaft through its midriff.







     The Alien clutches at the spear.







     Yellow acid begins to flow from the wound.







     Before the fluid can touch the floor...







     Ripley reaches back and pulls the switch.







     Blows the rear hatch.







     The atmosphere in the shuttle immediately sucked into space.







     The bleeding creature along with it.







     Ripley grabs a strut to keep from being pulled out.







     The Alien shoots past her.







     Grab's Ripley's ankle with an appendage.















     EXT. NARCISSUS                                        220















     Ripley now hanging halfway out of the shuttle-craft.







     The Alien clinging to her leg.







     She kicks at it with her free foot.







     The Creature holds fast.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        221















     Ripley looks for any salvation.







     Grabs the hatch level.







     Yanks it.







     The hatch slams shut, closing Ripley safely inside.















     EXT. NACISSUS                                         222















     The Alien still outside the shuttle-craft.







     Within the vacuum of space.







     The top of its appendage mashed into the closed hatch.















     INT. NARCISSUS                                        223















     Acid starts to foam along the base of the hatch.







     Eats away at the metal.







     Ripley stumbles forward to the controls.







     Pushes the ram jet lever.















     EXT. NARCISSUS - OUTER SPACE                          224







  







     The Creature struggling.







     Jet exhaust located at the rear of the craft.







     The engines belch flame for a few seconds.







     Then shut off.







     Incinerating, the Alien tumbles slowly away into space.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS                                        225







  







     Ripley hurries to the rear hatch.







     Peers through the glass.







  







     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                      226







  







     The burned mass of the Alien drifts slowly away.







     Writhing, smoking.







     Tumbling into the distance.







     Pieces dropping off.







     The shape bloats, then bursts.







     Spray of particles in all directions.







     Then smoldering fragments dwindle into infinity.







  







     INT. NARCISSUS - LATER                                227







  







     Now repressurized.







     Ripley is seated in the control chair.







     Calm and composed, almost cheerful.







     Cat purring in her lap.







     She dictates into a recorder.







  







                              RIPLEY







               I should reach the frontier in







               another five weeks.  With a







               little luck the network will







               pick me up...This is Ripley,







               W564502460H, executive officer,







               last survivor of the commercial







               starship Nostromo signing off.







                      (pause)







               Come on cat.















     She switches off the recorder.







     Stares into space.







              







     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                      228







  







     The shuttle-craft Narcissus sails into the distance.







  







                             FADE OUT







                              







                             THE END
