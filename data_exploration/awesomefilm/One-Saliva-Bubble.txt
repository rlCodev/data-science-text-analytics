               INT. HIGH-TECH TRACKING STATION - NIGHT

               A top-secret, experimental, offensive/defensive military 
               installation hidden away in the countryside outside 
               Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

               CLOSE on a beautiful, intricate, state of the art computer 
               panel as it is lifted out of a large console. A huge, dimly 
               lit display board, sporting a galaxy of small running lights, 
               looms above.

               The panel's removal creates a large, vulnerable opening, 
               inside of which is a massive confluence of electronics.

               As a small group of refined, well-groomed SCIENTISTS 
               studiously examine the removed panel, their intense 
               concentration is periodically disrupted by the hysterical 
               guffaws of a nearby group of three uniformed SECURITY GUARDS, 
               who appear to be refugees from the Neolithic period.

               The Guards, totally oblivious to the Scientists, are regaling 
               each other with pitiful and infantile jokes.

                                     GUARD #1
                         ...so she said to him, "poo-poo on 
                         your pee-pee".

               The Guards explode like a pack of howling hyenas. The 
               Scientists glance over at them with a look that seems to 
               say, "How is it possible for us to be sharing the same 
               planet?"

                                     GUARD #2
                         Did you just cut a big one or is 
                         Suzie back in town?

               Guard #3, the biggest Neanderthal of the bunch, stops laughing 
               long enough to contribute a rude, tongue-flapping raspberry, 
               during the course of which...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON FLAPPING TONGUE

               Unbeknownst to him, Guard #3 jettisons a perfect saliva bubble 
               out into the air and we follow it through space, across the 
               room, past the unknowing, refined, well-groomed Scientists 
               and down into the microscopic copper wires, creating a tiny, 
               seemingly insignificant electrical short circuit, which will 
               soon prove to have monumental consequences.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSEUP COMPUTER CONTROL PANEL

               Unnoticed by anyone in the room, a small, yellow light 
               emitting diode blinks on, then blinks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EARTH'S STATOSPHERE - NIGHT

               A simple, streamlined satellite, which resembles nothing so 
               much as a large red onion surrounded by a hula-hoop, suddenly 
               stops, then spins on its axis. As we MOVE IN CLOSE on the 
               satellite we hear a loud metallic CLICK, and a small panel 
               slides open revealing a digital clock with a readout of: 
               24:00. Another CLICK and the clock begins to count down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXTREME CLOSE UP

               On the bubble rhythmically pulsating between the two copper 
               wires. Bubble MUSIC begins and we roll CREDITS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE, KANSAS - MORNING

               A billboard beside the highway on the outskirts of town reads:

                                 "WELCOME TO NEWTONVILLE
                            LIGHTNING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD...

                                       POP. 43,108"

               Behind the billboard, two lightning bolts crack the dry desert 
               sky, followed by a peal of distant thunder, under which FADES 
               IN the melodic strains of a happy country waltz.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE ROLLER RINK - MORNING

               A gigantic, old red barn, its roof adorned by a huge, cement 
               roller skate, whose weatherworn wheels revolve lazily in the 
               warm morning sun. Neon sparks spray out from under the wheels. 
               A sign under the skate reads:

                      "GET A CHARGE ON OUR LIGHTNING FAST SPEEDWAY!"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTONVILLE ROLLER RINK - MORNING

               BIG TOM and WOODY, the rink's proprietors, sit on a small 
               balcony overlooking the rink, directly above the concession 
               stand, manned by RANDY, a pear-shaped menial. Randy pours 
               two coffees, under the critical supervision of Woody, a man 
               particularly obsessive about the preparation of his java.

                                     WOODY
                         One lump you idiot.

                                     RANDY
                         How many lumps?

                                     WOODY
                         ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                                     BIG TOM

                         Randy, defrost the "Beefy Cheese 
                         Louise".

                                     RANDY
                         Yes, sir.

               Randy moves to a refrigerator, plastered with a garish sign 
               that reads:

                           "HOT AND JUICY BEEFY CHEESE LOUISE"

               He opens it, revealing neatly arranged rows of bright yellow, 
               cheese-covered hamburger patties. Big Tom and Woody sit back, 
               sip their coffee, gazing out at the lone COUPLE skating around 
               the rink.

                                     BIG TOM
                         Not bad business for a Wednesday.

               Woody looks nervously at his watch, hardly reassured.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING off the huge skate, we travel down the road and can't 
               help but notice the large, rotating, neon lightning rod on 
               top of an electric pink, pearlescent stucco building. The 
               sign below the rod reads:

                                  "ANNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD

               Ominous jazz MUSIC fades up and out as we pass Vinnie's. 
               Across the street, on the marquee of the Rialto Theatre we 
               see the words:

               WALLY NEWTON, a forty year old milquetoast salesman, wilts 
               under the stern finger of his boss, militaristic, ramrod-
               stiff LUCKY BUCK.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         Before you fall out for chow, you 
                         yellow-bellied, jelly-spine, you 
                         march directly out there, soldier, 
                         engage the enemy, and DON'T let them 
                         look under the hood.

                                     WALLY
                              (quivering)

                         Mister, the only BUT I want to hear 
                         from you is, "my butt's out there 
                         selling that vehicle". Move out!

                                     WALLY
                         Yes sir, Lucky Buck.

               Wally heads directly out the door. The door closes. Lucky 
               Buck watches him go.

               INTERCUT:

               LUCKY BUCK'S POV

               Wally moves to the Couple, engages them in a conversation we 
               don't hear. The Husband points to the hood. Wally nervously 
               glances back at Lucky Buck, who stares at him. Wally pulls 
               his neck in and opens the hood. Lucky Buck shakes his head 
               in dismay, mutters...

               A large, imposing, 30's style, concrete office building, 
               topped by a gigantic, blue "B".

               INT. COMPANY "B" - DAY

               The lobby reception area; blue carpet, blue walls. Two 
               EMPLOYEES pass by the RECEPTIONIST, all wearing standard 
               company issue yellow uniforms that sport a big blue "B" on 
               the lapel.

               Looking through the glass front doors we see HORTON THURSBY, 
               a man who from a distance you might mistake for Wally Newton, 
               until you get close enough to feel his radioactively 
               terrifying aura of twisted, homicidal power. His eyes are 
               like black, malignant bumblebees. His sport coat is a hundred 
               decibels. The doors fly open as if to flee from him and he 
               enters without breaking his juggernaut stride. The 
               Receptionist, who on the face of it appears she could give 
               him a run for his money, looks up as he reaches the desk.

                              (extremely ominous)
                         What did you say?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         I s-s-said, no one here, that name.

                                     HORTON
                         Because that's my name, tubby.

                         Horton Thursby.

               Panicked, she rifles through her appointment book and slams 
               her finger down when she finds...

                                     RECEPTIONIST

                         here.

                         Indeed you do, of course you do, you 
                         certainly do, he's expecting you, 
                         he's set aside the time to --

                         That's enough.

                         take the Ex-exec-executive Elevator --

               Horton's already making a beeline for the elevator; its doors 
               zip open and shut behind him as he enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton stands underneath a speaker, piping out insipid Muzak. 
               His icy stare travels up to the speaker. It sputters, gasps 
               and goes silent. His gaze moves back down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lederhosen clad PORTERS on skis carry in the curbside luggage 
               of passengers arriving in a variety of sleds and toboggans. 
               A small herd of bell-clad COWS part as a horse-drawn sleigh 
               pulls up and out hops a sprightly, middle-aged, bright-eyed, 
               frizzy-haired genius, PROFESSOR HUGO ZINZERMACHER. He walks 
               up to the DRIVER and hands him a note.

                                     HUGO
                         International Airport, please.

               The Driver looks at him, looks at the note. The note reads:

                              "PLEASE TAKE THE PROFESSOR TO
                              ZURICH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT"

               The Driver turns back to the Professor.

                                     DRIVER
                         You are here.

                         That may be, however I have a plane 
                         to catch.

                                     DRIVER
                         Please. This IS the airport.

               The Professor looks around, looks back at the Driver.

                                     HUGO
                         Thank you so much.

               He takes off his coat, hands it to the Driver and gets back 
               into the sleigh. The Driver exhales heavily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ZURICH AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

               Doors open, the Driver hustles the Professor in through the 
               doors, carrying his bag and coat. Two young clean-cut men, 
               BERT FINE and MEL GLEASON, both in bright blue uniforms with 
               a big yellow "A" on the label, spot the Professor, rush across 
               the terminal to him.

                                     BERT
                         Professor Zinzermacher?

                                     HUGO
                              (cheerfully)
                         No, I'm Professor Zinzermacher.

               Bert and Mel look at each other. The Driver shakes his head, 
               hands the bag and coat to Bert and Mel and walks away.

                                     HUGO
                         I am Professor Hugo Zinzermacher. 
                         Hugo you way und I'll go mine.

               He extends a hand. They each shake it. Under the following 
               wails the low, sonorous boom of an Alpine horn.

               Mel looks at his watch.

                         That's us. Have your ticket, 
                         Professor?

                         Well, I don't mind if I do. What 
                         kind?

               Mel and Bert look at each other again.

                                     BERT
                         Would you mind going through your 
                         pockets, Professor --

                         an airline ticket to Kansas.

                         not exceeding the bifurcation of the 
                         remaining cardinal coordinates?

                         There was something in the report 
                         about his socks...

               They both kneel down and each pulls up a pant leg, revealing 
               droopy socks of vastly different colors. One sock yields a 
               toothbrush and the other a crumpled airline ticket which Mel 
               immediately grabs.

               They each grab one of Hugo's arms and start running him 
               towards the gate.

               MEANWHILE, BACK IN NEWTONVILLE, KANSAS

               INT. COMPANY "B" BOARDROOM - DAY

               THWACK! A telescoping pointer in the hand of Company "B"'s 
               CEO, MR. BIGGS, smacks into a lifesize photograph of Professor 
               Zinzermacher on the wall of the Company "B" boardroom. In 
               the photograph, the Professor's shoelaces are wildly askew. 
               His rumpled, tweed suit is encrusted with food. His frizzled 
               hair looks like a bird's nest. A small retinue of yellow-
               clad FUNCTIONARIES sit at the conference table, giving Horton, 
               at the far end, a wide berth.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         He can't even tie his own shoes, yet 
                         he's one of the greatest minds of 
                         Western Civilization, and who's got 
                         him? Company "A"!! According to Mr. 
                         Posthole, our worthy mole who's 
                         penetrated the innermost sanctums of

               CAMERA drifts over and finds MR. POSTHOLE, the Company "B" 
               spy, a shifty blonde guy in brick-thick black hornrims.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         -- they've purchased Professor

               Everyone smiles and all eyes turn to Horton. He doesn't 
               flinch.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         Thursby, this... is your target.

               Hugo's picture comes into focus and cross-hairs appear between 
               his eyes, as if looking through the telescopic sight of an 
               elephant gun.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As he lights a cigarette, inhales a big drag. His eyes flit 
               back to Mr. Biggs.

                         It's your money.

               The Functionary nearest to Horton subtly moves the tabletop 
               "THANK YOU FOR NOT SMOKING" plaque out of Horton's sightline.

               Mel and Bert are asleep under blankets, both smiling 
               blissfully, but their sleep becomes more troubled and they 
               are eventually woken by an atrociously loud cellophane 
               rustling SOUND. The Professor is trying desperately to open 
               a small airline bag of peanuts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLY NEWTON'S HOUSE - DAY

               Wally drives his 1950 two-tone, four-door Pontiac Firechief 
               into the driveway of his modest house. He stops the car, 
               cuts the engine and cautiously peers out the window. Silence. 
               He carefully opens the car door, trying to minimize all 
               sounds, gets out and tip-toes towards the front door.

               Out of nowhere, flies a tiny, yapping Pekinese dog, sporting 
               a yellow ribbon in its hair and baring its hideous little 
               teeth. Wally breaks into a sprint and is about to reach the 
               door when the dog overtakes him and clamps its jaws onto one 
               of his ankles. Wally wildly flails his leg around, trying to 
               dislodge the beast, finally succeeds and sends it soaring 
               into the air over a hedge.

               Wally bolts into the house, slamming the door behind him, 
               just as the dog jets back on the attack, making a hair net 
               out of the screen door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Wally catches his breath, turns. A savage cry is heard and 
               his son, GORDIE, rolls out from behind an overstuffed chair 
               and empties a toy machine gun at his father's chest and head. 
               Wally just stands there.

                         We were supposed to look at our video 
                         BEFORE dinner so we could practice 
                         DURING dinner. I suppose you forgot 
                         the wine, too.

                         You were going to give me an excuse, 
                         weren't you? Wally? Do I look like 
                         the type of person who'd be interested 
                         in an excuse?

               Demoralized, Wally slouches towards his overstuffed chair, 
               reaching under his left arm to scratch.

                                     POLLY
                         Don't you touch that rash! You'll 
                         keep me up all night with your 
                         scratching!
                              (Wally slumps in the 
                              chair)
                         If I was really interested in hearing 
                         some pitiful story don't you think 
                         I'd ask to hear it? Do I look like 
                         the type of person who lives in a 
                         fantasy world? Look at me, Wally. 
                         Wally, look at me when I'm talking 
                         to you, what do you see? Hmm?
                              (Wally shakes his 
                              head)
                         Do you see a poor, tired housewife, 
                         holding our lives together by sheer 
                         force of will, who received today a 
                         phone call? A phone call from your 
                         rich relatives up at the Manor who 
                         didn't otherwise even know I'm alive, 
                         who asked ME to ask YOU to please 
                         pick up your idiot cousin Newt 
                         tomorrow at the airport? Do you have 
                         any idea how humiliating that is?

               She stands and screams towards the ceiling, repeatedly. Wally 
               covers his eyes and face with his hands. When he uncovers 
               them, Gordie is right in front of him, assuming the classic 
               police stance. He fires six quick rounds from his toy pistol, 
               emptying the magazine point blank at Wally's head.

               CLOSE on the grainy image of a sophisticated couple seated 
               at a candlelit table. Syrupy MUSIC and a dry, industrial 
               film NARRATOR over...

                                     NARRATOR'S VOICE
                         Sniff the cork along with us now and 
                         let its heady bouquet transport you 
                         into the Wonderful World of Wine 
                         Tasting! Part Two.
                              (big music cue)

               Wally and Polly sit facing the television, each holding a 
               large glass of red wine, staring attentively at the screen. 
               Wally wears an apron that says: "DON'T BOTHER ME I'M COOKING"

                                     NARRATOR'S VOICE
                         You've made your selection, and by 
                         the sommelier's sly little smile you 
                         know he approves. The wine's been 
                         decanted, it's had a chance to b-r-e-
                         a-t-h-e. It sits, poised in your 
                         glass, a ruby nectar beckoning your 
                         lips.
                              (hushed tones)
                         Now, band forward... a little 
                         further... a little further, that's 
                         right...

               Wally and Polly follow the actions of the couple on the 
               screen.

                                     NARRATOR'S VOICE
                         Extend the neck... imagine your lips 
                         forming the perfect letter "o"... 
                         lower the "o" to the rim... now, 
                         remember the babbling brook...

               The couple on screen LOUDLY SUCKS UP AIR AND WINE, making a 
               weird fluted whistling sounds. Wally and Polly mimic it.

                                     NARRATOR'S VOICE
                         ...and again...

               Both couples repeat the action.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A fierce wind is howling, violently waving a tree limb in 
               front of the sign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SOOTHING BREEZES OFFICE - DAY

               DR. ANGELA RUTHERFORD, in a sharp, tailored tweed suit, is 
               consulting with the sanitarium's administrator, DR. ETHAN 
               FLORD. As they speak, he watches the fish in a small aquarium 
               on his desk. Angela holds a thermos of coffee.

                                     ANGELA
                         So all I really need is your signature 
                         here, Dr. Flord, and we can release 
                         Newt Newton for his annual visit 
                         home.

               She puts a form in front of him on the desk.

                                     DR. FLORD
                         You know, he's not even left us yet 
                         and it's as if I miss Newt already. 
                         When I'm with him, of course I'm 
                         always with him in spirit, as I am 
                         with all our patients, even now, 
                         against all evidence to the contrary, 
                         I sense some small spark of mental 
                         activity behind those bulging eyes. 
                         Perhaps this is a projection on my 
                         part. A projection filled with a 
                         physician's unquenchable hopefulness.

                                     ANGELA
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DR. FLORD
                         Has it been a year already? It seems 
                         it was only last week when he was 
                         flying off to the bosom of his family, 
                         when in fact three hundred and sixty 
                         five days, give or take a few -- 
                         this wasn't a leap year was it? No, 
                         of course not. Ah, remembrances -- 
                         remembrances.

               Fighting off the wave of crippling boredom and mental 
               exhaustion induced by the Doctor's monotone, Angela quickly 
               pours a large cup of coffee, stifling a yawn.

                                     ANGELA
                         I only need your signature --

                                     DR. FLORD
                         Was it March of last year when my 
                         Aunt was fitted for her prosthesis? 
                         I suppose it was. What a difference 
                         it made, how it changed her! In ways 
                         one couldn't possibly imagine. First, 
                         the new carpeting. Inexplicable 
                         perhaps, at first glance. But on 
                         closer scrutiny, however, an 
                         underpinning of rationality seemed 
                         to emerge.

               Angela takes a big gulp of coffee, grabs an arm of a chair 
               and lowers herself into it, struggling to keep her eyes open. 
               The fish in the aquarium begin to slow perceptibly.

                                     ANGELA
                         Only your signature. Please, Doctor.

                                     DR. FLORD
                              (looking at his hands)
                         As if creation, splintered into a 
                         hundred million realities, was 
                         actually nothing less than the 
                         complicated interweavings...
                              (locking his fingers 
                              together)
                         ...of one, grand design. Well-hidden, 
                         mind you, but upon deeper examination, 
                         open the doors...
                              (he opens his hands 
                              and wiggles his 
                              fingers)
                         ...and there's all the people.

                              chuckle)
                         And of course that's when I realized 
                         Aunt Hildy had friends and had 
                         purchased a pet. Which brings me 
                         back to Newt. Isn't it odd how every 
                         Newton since Newt's Grandad has been 
                         struck by lightning? Newt's Grandad 
                         was struck by lightning. He's a 
                         complete idiot. Newt's father was 
                         struck by lightning. He's no longer 
                         with us. And of course Newt was struck 
                         by lightning and by golly, he's a 
                         complete idiot. And all of them were 
                         named Newton. Newton Newton. Newton 
                         Newton. Newton Newton...

               We hear the SOUND of liquid pouring slowly onto the carpet. 
               We see Angela's relaxed hand tipping her coffee cup towards 
               the floor. We see Angela is sound asleep. A fish in the 
               aquarium slowly rolls and goes belly up.

                         Those eyes. Those bulging, happy 
                         puppy eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               We see a COOK pick up an egg, crack the egg on top of Newt's 
               head and empty it into a huge bowl. We MOVE around and down 
               the customized chair Newt is strapped into, to his right 
               knee; as we hear another egg crack, Newt's knee jerks up and 
               hits a pedal device that flips a pancake on a long, conveyor-
               belt griddle. We follow the pancakes on the beltway to he

                         yourself, fasten his seatbelt, 
                         remember to tell the Stewardess no 
                         liquids for Newt and don't let them

                         Have a wonderful time at home, Newt.

               Angela gives Newt a big kiss; he smiles enigmatically and 
               tries to deck her with a roundhouse right, which she expertly 
               ducks, and he completes his compulsive reaction to her kiss 
               with a sly wolf whistle. The Orderly tightens his grip on 
               Newt's handle. Angela attaches a large, adhesive badge to 
               Newt's jacket that reads:

               EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

               We see the back of a large semi packed solid with large bricks 
               of a yellow substance, wrapped in waxy paper. A FOREMAN with 
               a clipboard walks back and forth as the two DRIVERS finish 
               tidying the cargo.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Boys, you've packed your load/ 
                         And it's time to hit the road/ 
                         Let the slowpokes eat your dust/ 
                         It's Newtonville or bust/ 
                         Let the highway be your heyday/ 
                         And I'll see you here on payday.

               The Drivers, who hate this rhyming business, close and lock 
               the doors. A picture of a large wheel of bright yellow cheese 
               is painted on the doors, along with the words:

                                "CHEESE IS MADE FROM MILK"

               The Drivers move to and enter the cab, as the Foreman works 
               himself into a rhyming frenzy.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Please, boys, please/ 
                         Be careful with that cheese/ 
                         For the Beefy Cheese Louise/ 
                         If anything should happen/ 
                         You'll put me in a squeeze/ 
                         You'll bring me to my knees/ 
                         I could lose all my fees/ 
                         Are you sure you've got your keys?
                              (the truck starts)
                         Watch out for all those trees! Hi-
                         ho, hi-ho/ 
                         I hate to see you go/ 
                         We'll see you back here soon/ 
                         Remember: Newtonville by noon!

               The truck thunders off into the night, obscuring the last 
               wretched rhymes of the Post Foreman.

               Wally sits catatonically in his overstuffed chair, with his 
               shirt off, his left arm raised in an uncomfortable position. 
               A big red rash under his left arm is covered with pink lotion. 
               The room is strewn with Gordie's toy weapons. Gordie himself 
               is violently stomping up and down on a newspaper-stuffed 
               dummy/enemy soldier, screaming as he guts the dummy and 
               plunges the toy knife into its brainpan. GUCCI-GUCCI, the 
               dreaded Pekingese, is busy rending one of Wally's argyle 
               socks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE on peanuts in the aisle, as we hear a plastic crunching 
               SOUND. While everyone else sleeps, the Professor futilely 
               struggles to pry open his salad dressing container with a 
               plastic fork.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton sits in his '40's noir hotel room, in a sleeveless T-
               shirt, boxer shorts and gartered socks, cleaning his massive, 
               chrome-plated .357 Magnum pistol, staring holes in a picture 
               of Professor Zinzermacher on the table in front of him. His 
               moll, LORRAINE, an irresistible, shapely blonde bombshell, 
               lolls on the bed, blowing kisses to the ceiling and watching 
               them float.

               waltz on a steel guitar. Big Tom is slowly and gracefully 
               skating around the rink in time to the music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A huge lightning rod in the shape of a key sits atop the 
               modest terminal. A sign on the building reads:

                                      "NEWTONVILLE'S

               A black stretch limo with a big "A" on the side pulls up in 
               front of the terminal. The stocky Cockney chauffeur, BOB 
               McNABB, gets out, and opens the door for his petite and proper 
               wife, ALICE, who gets out of the passenger side. Both are 
               dressed in yellow uniforms that sport a big blue "A".

                         Come on then.

               She shyly gives him a kiss on the cheek. He gives her an 
               affectionate hug and tickle, which makes her giggle. She 
               starts towards the terminal. Bob admires her small, shapely 
               figure.

               Wally Newton pulls into a slot, parks and starts digging 
               through the mass of Gordie's toys, piled high from the front 
               seat to the back. He retrieves a piece of paper with some 
               flight info on it, stuck to a huge wad of gum. The array of 
               weaponry and Gordie-and-Polly-generated filth in the car is 
               staggering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Alice moves through the terminal, past a small newsstand. We 
               PICK UP and STAY WITH Horton Thursby, lurking near the 
               magazine rack. He sets down the copy of "DETECTIVES IN LOVE 
               MAGAZINE" he was pretending to read and follows Alice toward 
               the arrival gates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HEINZ 57 COMPANY BANNER

               Near an arrival gate. The banner reads:

               WE MOVE off the banner to see Horton walking away, still 
               following Alice towards the gate. We PICK UP and STAY with 
               Wally, as he enters through a side door, looking for a trash 
               can. He carries a large conglomeration of hundreds of pink 
               gum wads and other sticky car refuse. We stay with Wally 
               until he crosses paths with a group of thirty-five robust 
               TEXANS, all in goofy, double-knit leisure suits, carrying 
               briefcases.

               Waiting to greet the Texans under the Heinz banner, beside a 
               big black cauldron are three large CHEFS in white outfits 
               and large chef's hats, bearing the distinctive, ketchup-red 
               "57" logo.

               As the Texans approach, a TAP DANCER dressed as a bottle of 
               Heinz 57 sauce rises out of the cauldron and begins 
               enthusiastically tap dancing to taped musical accompaniment. 
               The Chefs shake the hands of the happy Texans and hand each 
               of them a large bottle of steak sauce.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Still looking for a trash can. Near another gate, he passes 
               another welcoming committee, under another banner that reads:

               MAYOR BILLY BENSON and his wife, DOTTY, stand behind two 
               BATON-TWIRLING BLONDES and a TRICK DOG jumping back and forth 
               through a hoop. A Sousa march blares as the CHINESE ACROBATS 
               come off the plane, all wearing identical Chinese red 
               sweatsuits with Nehru collars. A great deal of bowing and 
               smiling and unintelligible greetings ensues.

               Wally's at a trash can, trying to dislodge the sticky gum 
               wad from his hands, when he looks out a window and spots 
               Newt in a crowd of people exiting a plane down a portable 
               stairway. Instead of crossing the tarmac to the terminal 
               with the other passengers, Newt stops at the bottom of the 
               stairs and is quickly left alone.

               A concerned STEWARDESS moves towards Newt. He smiles and 
               backs up. The Stewardess stops, Newt stops. Wally watches. 
               Within moments half a dozen assorted AIRPORT PERSONNEL are 
               giving chase to Newt, who gleefully darts in and out around 
               the plane's landing gear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Professor deplane off the jetway, where they're greeted by 
               Alice. Mel and Bert are rhythmically bobbing their heads and 
               knees, because they have to urinate with such urgency their 
               back teeth are floating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Alice stares at him again, nods slowly and turns towards the 
               baggage claim area.

               Two burly SECURITY GUARDS carry a rigid, smiling Newt up a 
               jetway into the terminal to the waiting Wally. Newt sees 
               Wally, points at him and breaks into a wild, moonbeam smile. 
               The Guards carry him to Wally.

                         Yes, sir, I am. Where's his sock?

               The other Guard holds up a bulging grey sock with a red 
               stripe. The Guards set Newt down. He and Wally immediately 
               start to circle each other, quickly accelerating into faster

               into huge, identical grins.

               SAMMY "THE STOMP" JOHNSON, a middle-aged black musician is 
               buying a big cigar from the CASHIER behind the counter. He 
               carries a well-traveled guitar case, stenciled with the words:

                               "SAMMY "THE STOMP" JOHNSON"

               As he moves on, lighting the stogie, HANK THE BARBER, a tall, 
               thin man, wearing sleeve garters and a racy bow-tie, exits 
               the Barber Shop across the corridor and moves towards the 
               newsstand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The satellite countdown moves under: 00:01 and starts counting 
               in seconds: 00:00:59. The satellite begins emitting a beeping 
               sound which gradually increases in tempo, pitch and volume. 
               Another panel slides open and a large, metallic nozzle slides 
               out.

               The baggage carousel starts revolving and bags begin to 
               appear. We see the following groupings: Alice, the Professor, 
               Mel and Bert.

                                     MEL
                         We'll be right back.

                                     BERT
                         We're going to the men's room.

               They begin fast-bobbing towards the men's room. Sammy "The 
               Stomp" Johnson waits just to the right of Alice, who takes 
               out a make-up mirror and powders her nose. Horton lurks behind 
               a nearby column, watching the Professor.

               The Texans and the Chinese Acrobats are on opposite sides of 
               the carousel, along with their respective welcoming 
               committees.

               Wally leads Newt to the carousel, takes off his belt, loops 
               it though the handle on Newt's jacket and ties it around a 
               column.

                                     NEWT
                         Can I pee?

                                     WALLY
                         Soon as I get your bag, Newt.

                                     NEWT
                         Rock' em-sock'em?

                                     WALLY
                              (hands Newt his sock)
                         I'll be right back, Newt. I see your 
                         bag right there.

               Wally starts after a plaid bag with a "SOOTHING BREEZES" tag 
               on it, trying to dart through the Texans to reach the bag 
               before it disappears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OUTER SPACE

               We see the satellite countdown: 00:00:03 / 00:00:02 / 00:00:01 
               and as it hits 00:00:00 the beeping crescendos and goes SILENT 
               for one brief moment. Then, the satellite produces an 
               emission; a small burst of light shoots from the nozzle and 
               hear a sound like a sharp slam on a ping-pong ball.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OUTER SPACE

               HIGH ANGLE, looking down on the United States. The emission, 
               a short piece of light, enters the earth's atmosphere and 
               heads down towards Kansas.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

               The emission strikes the Ben Franklin key on top of the 
               terminal. The key lights up and spins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTONVILLE AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE, looking down on the carousel area. The emission 
               zooms down, strikes the carousel and a glowing four-way beam 
               in the shape of a "X" appears. One arm of the "X" connects 
               Horton Thursby and Wally Newton; the other arm connects 
               Professor Hugo Zinzermacher and Newt Newton.

               The glowing "X" vibrates wildly and spins, sending off small 
               pieces of the emission in various directions.

               One piece hits the group of Texans, bounces over and strikes 
               the Chinese Acrobats.

               Another shard hits Alice, makes a sharp right and slams into 
               Sammy "The Stomp" Johnson.

               A third bolt hits Alice's open make-up mirror, bounces behind 
               her and nails Mel and Bert just as they open the door to the 
               men's room. This piece of the emission then hits the mirror 
               in the men's room and shoots back out into the corridor, 
               striking the Cashier and Hank the Barber at the newsstand.

               The bolt continues out an open door, bounces off the three 
               Heinz 57 Chefs, the tap dancing 57 Sauce Bottle and the Trick 
               Dog, all standing by the curb, then smacks into the head of 
               Bob McNabb, sitting behind the wheel of Company "A"'s limo.

               From there, the beam spreads out towards all of Newtonville.

               The three Chefs, the tap dancing Bottle and the Trick Dog 
               are suddenly compelled to leap into Bob's limo. And Bob, as 
               if possessed by the spirit of a mad hot rodder, puts the 
               pedal to the metal, lays two hundred feet of rubber, slams 
               on the breaks when he reaches a stop sign, throws it in 
               reverse and comes roaring backwards through the pick-up area 
               in front of the terminal.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - DAY

               The glowing "X" of light burns brightly; the clothes of the 
               two opposing pairs fly off and land on the person opposite; 
               Newt now wears the Professor's clothes and the Professor is 
               wearing Newt's clothes. Horton Thursby is wearing Wally 
               Newton's clothes and Wally Newton is wearing the clothes of 
               Horton Thursby. Newt's sock flies into the Professor's hand. 
               He immediately drops it. Horton's .357 Magnum flies across 
               and lands in Wally's hand. He immediately drops it.

               The "X" hits another level of intensity and now the two pairs 
               literally change places; Newt Newton, in the Professor's 
               clothes, now stands next to Alice. He leans down and picks 
               up his sock. The Professor is in Newt's clothes, strapped to 
               the column. Wally wears Horton's clothes, lurking behind a 
               column and Horton wears Wally's clothes, looking for Newt's 
               bag. Horton bends down, picks up his Magnum and sticks it in 
               the waistband of his pants.

               The "X" hits its brightest level and completely EVAPORATES. 
               The carousel makes a stressful, screeching sound.

               Newt, the Professor, Wally and Horton blink their eyes and 
               shake their heads, feeling confused.

               For no reason they can understand, the Texans are compelled 
               to march en mass to the other side of the carousel, just as 
               the Chinese acrobats, equally befuddled and compelled, walk 
               around to where they Texans were standing.

               Alice and Sammy "The Stomp" Johnson are still standing side 
               by side. However, their positions have been reversed, she's 
               wearing his sharkskin suit and aviator shades and he's wearing 
               her Company "A" dress suit.

               The carousel stops suddenly, smoking slightly. Stunned 
               silence. Mayor Billy Benson is the first person who rouses 
               himself enough to speak. He makes a few strange noises, before 
               squeezing out the words...

                                     MAYOR BILLY BENSON
                         It-it-it-it-it was only lightning. 
                         Stay c-c-c-c-calm.

               The crowd, instantly reassured and pathetically grateful for 
               this convenient explanation, murmurs, as one...

                                     CROWD
                         It was only lightning.

               The carousel slowly starts to revolve again. People begin to 
               move forward to claim their luggage.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Cashier takes the paper, opens the cash register drawer 
               and tries to stuff the newspaper inside. Meanwhile, Hank 
               unwraps a candy bar and smears it in a tight circle on his 
               forehead, near the third eye area. The Cashier takes out a 
               handful of nickels and dimes, holds out his arm and throws 
               the coins onto the corridor floor. The Barber and the Cashier 
               look at each other for a moment with a look of complete 
               blankness. The Barber spins violently and storms back to the 
               Barbershop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The satellite emission beam zips towards the "Welcome to

               brightly for a second, then disappears with a loud pop. A 
               moment later, a semi-tractor trailer barrels down the highway, 
               entering Newtonville. On it's back doors we see the words:

               Newt-as-the-Professor stares blissfully. Mel and Bert come 
               hustling out of the terminal. Due to the peculiar nature of 
               the satellite emission, they, along with everyone else 
               affected by it, are only dimly aware that any changes have 
               occurred.

                              (waving the hankie)
                         Yoo-hoo! Bobby! Ducks! Oh, ducks, 
                         come right over here now, we're all 
                         ready to go.

               The limo screams back into view, stops on a dime. Bob McNabb 
               is a desperate man, a vessel for a twisted A.J. Foyt from 
               Hell. His "good" side controls the foot on the break, the 
               "demonic" side pumps the accelerator like Buddy Righ 
               assaulting his bass drum pedal. The entire car shakes and 
               smokes like a dragster on the starting line.

                                     BOB MCNABB
                              (eyes popping)
                         Jump in, Mates, and make it snappy; 
                         I'm ridin' a rhino in a brushfire.

               Doors fly open, Mel and Bert lift Newt-as-the-Professor into 
               the back seat with them, wedging in between the Chefs and 
               the Tap Dancing Bottle. Stricken with a profound love, the 
               Trick Dog instantly leaps into Newt-as-the-Professor's arms. 
               Equally infatuated, Newt-as-the-Professor grabs the little 
               Dog's cheeks and they smile at each other, point blank. Sammy 
               "The Stomp"-as-Alice climbs into the front seat beside Bob.

                                     SAMMY "THE STOMP"-AS-ALICE
                              (a bit stern)
                         Robby-ducks, remind me to speak to 
                         you about your tea consumption. It 
                         seems to be affecting your driving --

               Bob can't hold back the surge any longer and the limo leaps 
               forward like a cheetah on the trail of a leaping ibex. Wally-
               as-Horton comes forward to the curb, hails a cab, jumps in 
               the back and says to the DRIVER:

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Follow that limo!

               The cab starts after the limo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Professor-as-Newt stands by, as Horton-as-Wally opens 
               the door to Wally's car. Enraged with revulsion, he reaches 
               in and with two or three violent motions sweeps Gordie's 
               toys and Polly's garbage out of the car, spraying it into 
               the parking lot.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What a load a' crap.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         So it would seem.

               Horton-as-Wally looks at him askance for a moment, then opens 
               the door for the Professor-as-Newt, places him in the front 
               seat and fastens his seat belt.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         I have a feeling we're not in Zurich 
                         anymore.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         You said a mouthful there, buddy.

               Horton-as-Wally starts the car and they drive off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

               The limo zooms towards an intersection. The light ahead turns 
               red. Bob slams on the breaks. The passengers tumble like ten-
               pins. Bob throws the limo into reverse and floors it. The 
               passengers, just regaining their balance, get thrown again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAB - DAY

               The Taxi Driver reacts in horror as the limo shoots backwards 
               towards him. Panicked, he puts the cab in reverse and floors 
               it. Wally-as-Horton holds on for dear life.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Did we do something wrong?

                                     CAB DRIVER
                              (nonchalant)
                         I see this sort'a stuff every day; 
                         the whole world's comin' apart.

               The limo shoots back past them, swerves, does a 360 and heads 
               back straight for them. The Cab Driver shifts back to drive 
               and burns rubber, the limo right on his rear fender.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         I gotta admit though, this one's 
                         somethin' special.

               The cab is pushed forward down the road by the limo. They 
               disappear over the crest of a hill.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEWTON MANOR - DAY

               A palatial estate, high on a hill, hard by the sixteenth tee 
               of the Newtonville Country Club golf course. A sign reads:

                                      "NEWTON MANOR"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTON MANOR ENTRYWAY - DAY

               In the grand foyer, at the base of a grand, circular 
               staircase, TIDMAN, a nervous, middle-aged, slightly disheveled 
               butler is addressing the assembled Manor STAFF.

                                     TIDMAN
                         As you know... Newt... is coming 
                         home. He will be arriving momentarily. 
                         You will recall two years ago, due 
                         to a former employee's negligence, 
                         one of the garages was not secured. 
                         Newt crawled into the workings of 
                         the furnace; during the six months 
                         it took to undo his handiwork we 
                         suffered through the coldest winter 
                         in recent memory. Black smoke issued 
                         from the faucets. Boiling water was 
                         found in the toilets. Thermostat 
                         circuitry was hardwired to all the 
                         baking ovens. Yes, as a result Chef 
                         Pierre did develop his "Jiffy Baked 
                         Alaska", which we've all enjoyed, he 
                         also developed a rare skin disorder 
                         from working in the 113 degree 
                         kitchen.

               A sheepish CHEF PIERRE, wearing heavy medical mittens and 
               hat with asbestos ear flaps, shrugs.

                                     CHEF PIERRE
                         Cis la'vie.

                                     TIDMAN
                         I want the following words engraved 
                         in the core of your beings: this 
                         year there will be no such incidents. 
                         If air can reach a hidden place, so 
                         can Newt. If water can flow through 
                         a crack, there too Newt will go. 
                         Readiness. Vigilance. Perseverance. 
                         May God be with us all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. / EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

               QUICK CUTS: Fine crockery's locked in high cabinets. Hallway 
               closet doors are nailed shut. Iron grates are padlocked over 
               air ducts. In the garage, a steel box is lowered by winch 
               over the Rolls. In the basement, a GUARD takes his post in 
               front of the new furnace.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

               The electric gates swing open. Horton-as-Wally drives Wally's 
               car up the circular drive to the front walk. Tidman approaches 
               the car, flanked by a pair of Orderlies -- IKE and MIKE -- 
               built like refrigerators. Tidman opens the door, Ike and 
               Mike stand by to pounce. The Professor-as-Newt looks up at 
               them and smiles. Horton-as-Wally gets out on the driver's 
               side.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (a big cheesy smile)
                         Welcome home, Master Newt. Hello, 
                         Wally.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Who are the goons?

                                     TIDMAN
                         Help for you-know-who. Come along, 
                         Newt, we've got the Rocking Horse 
                         room all ready for you.

               The Orderlies lift the Professor-as-Newt out of the car. He 
               smiles at them benignly.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Two big assistants. This is good.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (shocked, to Wally)
                         What a tremendous improvement.
                              (goes to the Professor-
                              as-Newt)
                         Can you say anything else?

                                     THE-PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         As I was saying to Bert and Mel, if 
                         we relate the vector on a 
                         parallelogram, allowing the azimuth 
                         to intersect but not confirm the 
                         dimensional factors contributing to 
                         the parameters of the logarithmic 
                         module, it won't necessarily be a 
                         part of it.

               Tidman turns back to Wally, almost relieved.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Still an idiot.

               He gestures to the Goons. One of them picks up the Professor-
               as-Newt by the handle on his coat, the other takes his plaid 
               bag.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Where's his sock?
                              (he shushes himself)
                         Never mind, let's not upset him.
                              (quietly to Horton-as-
                              Wally)
                         We've got duplicates.

               Tidman is ready to lead the others into the Manor, when he 
               realizes Horton-as-Wally is still standing there.

                                     TIDMAN
                         You didn't want to... come in, did 
                         you, Wally?

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What did you say?

                                     TIDMAN
                              (shocked, instantly 
                              cowed)
                         I said, would you like to come in?

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What would I want to go in there 
                         for? I got a home of my own, pal.

               Horton-as-Wally coolly gets into the car and drives away. 
               Tidman frowns, perplexed, then escorts the Goons and the 
               Professor-as-Newt into the Manor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Tidman leads the Professor-as-Newt, his feet barely touching 
               the floor, half-carried by Ike and Mike, into the grand foyer. 
               The Manor Staff is assembled like shock troops about to charge 
               enemy trenches. Some wear chest protectors, others shin 
               guards, a few carry cans of Mace and stun guns. The Professor-
               as-Newt smiles at them with growing excitement.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (to Tidman)
                         If you could show me to my room I'll 
                         start work immediately.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (apprehensive)
                         What did you have planned, Master 
                         Newt?

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         As you know from my letters, I hope 
                         to make a massive breakthrough. It 
                         came to me while contemplating a 
                         large, smooth concrete floors.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Very good, Master Newt.
                              (aside, to an Aide)
                         Get Gordon Cole on the phone; I want 
                         a complete inventory of all our floor 
                         systems.

               The Aid moves off, Ike and Mike start carting the Professor-
               as-Newt up the grand staircase.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPANY "A" - DAY

               A massive office building, across the street from and nearly 
               identical to Company "B". On the roof is a gigantic yellow:

                                           "A"

               The limo tears up in a series of short, brutal stops and 
               starts. Tremendous grinding SOUNDS, billowing smoke, the 
               throttle wide open, fan belt screaming.

                                     SAMMY "THE STOMP"-AS-ALICE
                         Get out quick before he kills us.
                              (screams at Bob)
                         NO MORE TEA! I'll speak with you at 
                         home.

               Mel and Bert quickly help Newt-as-the Professor out of the 
               limo. Newt-as-the Professor and the Trick Dog still cling to 
               each other. Sammy "The Stomp"-as-Alice is the last one out, 
               before the limo explodes backwards away from the curb, the 
               three Chefs and the Tap Dancing Bottle still trapped inside. 
               PASSERS-BY cover their ears at the excruciatingly deafening 
               SOUND of engine and tires.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TAXI

               Stopped across the street. The Taxi Driver hoses down his 
               flaming engine with a fire extinguisher, while Wally-as-Horton 
               takes out a pair of binoculars and looks through them...

               INTERCUT:

               WALLY-AS-HORTON'S POV - BINOCULAR MATTE

               We see Sammy "The Stomp"-as-Alice, Mel, Bert and Newt-as-the 
               Professor enter a side door in the Company "A" building. The 
               door is flanked by two UNIFORMED GUARDS. Wally-as-Horton 
               moves the binoculars up to read the sign above the door:

                                       C.A.N.A.P.E.
                                   Center for Advanced
                             Nucleacly Arbitrary Permutation
                                     Experimentation
                                 A DIVISION OF COMPANY A.

               Wally-as-Horton lowers the binoculars, puts them in his 
               pocket. He takes a matchbook and a pack of cigarettes out, 
               lights one up like a nerd version of James Dean, inhales 
               deeply, plunging himself into a spasmodic coughing jag. He 
               jettisons the cigarette into the gutter and while trying to 
               recatch his breath, he notices the printing on the matchbook:

                                 "VINNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD"

               A glimmer of confused memory flits across his features. He 
               reaches under his coat and gingerly scratches his rash.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPANY "A" CANAPE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Bert and Mel follow Sammy "The Stomp"-as-Alice and Newt-as-
               the Professor through automatic-opening, glass, sliding doors, 
               bordered in red suede. On the doors are the words:

                                       C.A.N.A.P.E
                                        TOP SECRET

               As they move through the doors, CAMERA drifts to find Mr. 
               Posthole, the Company "B" spy, lurking in the corridor. He 
               smiles, as he watches them enter the clean room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CANAPE CLEAN ROOM - DAY

               Inside the "clean room" reception area are assembled the top 
               brass of Company "A", forming a reception line to greet them, 
               all gently bobbing their heads. The President, DELBERT 
               CORRIGAN, a young, dandified, old-money Ivy leaguer, gives 
               Sammy "The Stomp"-as-Alice a slightly strange look.

                                     SAMMY "THE STOMP"-AS-ALICE
                         Gentlemen, may I present Professor 
                         Hugo Zinzermacher.

               Polite applause. Newt-as-the Professor beams, still holding 
               the Trick Dog in one hand and his dirty, bulging sock in the 
               other. Delbert Corrigan steps forward to shake his hand, 
               accompanied by his young, blonde bombshell wife, SIMONE.

                                     SAMMY "THE STOMP"-AS-ALICE
                         Professor, I'd like you to meet the 
                         President of Company "A", Mr. Delbert 
                         Corrigan and his lovely wife, Simone.

               Corrigan shakes Newt-as-the Professor's hand. Newt-as-the 
               Professor won't let go, happily pumping away.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                         This is one of the proudest moments 
                         of my life. I can safely say I speak 
                         for everyone here when I tell you 
                         that with you pulling your oar in 
                         our shell we'll be at the mouth of 
                         the Charles before you can sing three 
                         bars of the Whiffenpoof song. Just 
                         dandy.
                              (getting a little 
                              uncomfortable)
                         What a darling little pooch.
                              (Newt-as-the-Professor 
                              continues to smile 
                              blankly and shake 
                              his hand)
                         Do you know my wife, Simone?

               Simone, in a devastating little Chanel number, steps forward.

                                     SIMONE
                              (bad Radcliffe French)
                         Professor, je suis tres heureux a 
                         faire votre connaissance.

               She grips Newt-as-the Professor by the shoulders and kisses 
               him on both cheeks. His eyes light up like a pinball machine, 
               he rears back and throws a roundhouse right. Simon and 
               Delbert, using their good genetic reflexes, both shy back in 
               shock. The punch sails past them and lands squarely on Mel's 
               nose with a resounding SMACK.

               Mel grabs his broken honker, tears squirt from his eyes. He 
               grabs the nearest wall and a piercing, high-pitched, one-
               note wail of contained agony escapes from him. Mel turns 
               back around.

                                     BERT
                              (stunned)
                         The Professor hit Mel.

               Holding his nose, Mel turns back to them, in extreme pain 
               and feeling somehow responsible for it.

                                     MEL
                         I must have provoked him.

               Everyone else is still speechless.

                                     NEWT-AS-THE PROFESSOR
                              (looking around)
                         Can I pee?

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                              (trying to smile)
                         Yes, C.A.N.A.P.E.
                              (he refers to his 
                              C.A.N.A.P.E. security 
                              badge)
                         And please be assured, the Center

                         absolutely thrilled to have you here. 
                         Please, be assured of this.

               Hiding behind her husband, eyes darting nervously, Simone 
               tries to light a cigarette, her hands shaking like a frog on 
               a hot plate.

                                     NEWT-AS-THE PROFESSOR
                         Can I pee?

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                              (slight pause)
                         What is it, exactly, that you're 
                         confused about?

               Newt-as-the-Professor makes a fast beeline to the nearby 
               men's room, clearly marked with the following symbol:

               Mel and Bert quickly confer.

                                     MEL
                         That could explain a lot.

                                     BERT
                         We should'a let him go when we got 
                         off the plane.

               They both quickly turn to Delbert Corrigan.

                                     MEL
                         We should'a let him go when he got 
                         off the plane.

                                     SAMMY "THE STOMP"-AS-ALICE
                              (also trying to explain)
                         One must continually bear in mind 
                         that these geniuses are a queer lot.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                              (the "good sport")
                         I've a few eccentrics swinging from 
                         my own family tree. If he delivers 
                         the "massive breakthrough" he's 
                         promised in correspondence, believe 
                         you me, we'll put up with the best 
                         the Professor can muster in the 
                         Peculiar Behavior Department.

               From inside the bathroom, we hear the Trick Dog happily 
               barking in a conversational way, as if talking to Newt-as-
               the-Professor. A moment later the door opens and a big, black 
               puff of smoke rolls into the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SDI SECTION FOUR - DAY

               A CORPORAL stares at the blinking red warning light we saw 
               earlier under the words:

                            "RANDOM COLL. DEEP SPACE EMISSION"

               The Corporal flicks the bulb once or twice, makes sure it's 
               not malfunctioning. It continues to blink, unabated. The 
               Corporal takes out a key, unlocks a small box, opens it, 
               flicks the switch inside. The blinking red light turns green, 
               continues to blink, turns back to red, rotates and a small 
               telephone slides out of a panel beneath it. The Corporal 
               picks up the phone, without taking his eyes off the still 
               blinking light.

                                     CORPORAL

                              calm)
                         Put me through to Colonel Mofler...
                              (pause)

                         Sir, we've got a tuna on the line. 
                         Yes, sir, a verified tuna.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Colonel Mofler sits at his desk, holding the phone.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Thank you, Corporal. I don't need to 
                         remind you this is Code Six...

               He hangs up, grimly takes a key from his desk, inserts it 
               into a lock on the edge of his desk. The desk top slides 
               open, revealing a large red book emblazoned with the word:

                                          "FISH"

               Colonel Mofler pages through the book. We see subheadings 
               that read: "TROUT, HALIBUT, GROUPER, ANCHOVIE, MACKERAL". He 
               comes to a page that reads: "TUNA". He read something that 
               shocks him.

               adorn the knotty-pine walls.

               The other Generals calmly confer. The group's spokesman, 
               GENERAL THRASHER, turns to General Conrad.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Sir... uh, should we notify, uh, 
                         the, uh, Commander in, uh, Chief?

               General Conrad looks at the red phone on the table in front 
               of him. He picks up the entire instrument and then bangs it 
               on the table with increasing intensity. The other Generals 
               don't move a muscle, brimming over with the Right Stuff

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!!!!

               General Conrad does a backflip and lands heavily, out of 
               sight, with the SOUND of major fracturing. The other Generals 
               respond with slight head shakes, sympathetic whistles and 
               other small, compassionate gestures.

                                     A GENERAL
                              (pause, calmly)
                         Mofler, call an ambulance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. VINNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD - DAY

               The wounded Taxi limps up to the door. Wally-as-Horton gets 
               out of the cab and cautiously enters the Rod.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD - DAY

               Pearlescant stucco and a persistent South Seas motif; 
               weathered rope nets, varnished blowfish lamps, dusty spears 
               and shields. The CUSTOMERS, a hardboiled bunch of sleazy 
               criminal types, freeze in their tracks when Wally-as-Horton 
               enters and tentatively makes his way across the room; the 
               denizens part for him like the Red Sea. VINNIE, the short, 
               stocky, balding proprietor, behind the bar is the only person 
               who dares to speak to him.

                                     VINNIE
                         Hey, Horton. What's happening?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                              (stops, terrified but 
                              handling it)
                         Not much. What's happening with you... 
                         Vinnie?

               He looks at Vinnie with some confusion.

                                     VINNIE
                              (clearly frightened 
                              of him)
                         Not much.

               Wally-as-Horton nods and continues on. He passes a booth 
               full of four GANGSTERS, clearly a few notches tougher than 
               the bar's other customers. Their leader, JIMMY "CRAWLIN" 
               UNDERWOOD, a big Irishman, rises as Wally-as-Horton 
               approaches. Wally-as-Horton's knees shake and he smiles 
               politely. The whole room tensely watches the following 
               exchange.

                                     UNDERWOOD
                              (timidly)
                         Me and the boys was wondering what a 
                         guy named Mr. Biggs is doing up in 
                         front of your apartment.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Why didn't you ask him?

                                     UNDERWOOD
                              (self-deprecating 
                              laugh)
                         Okay, Horton, sure, it's none of our 
                         business, you know us, always lookin' 
                         for a taste of the action.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Would you like me to ask him for 
                         you, Mr. Underwood?

                                     UNDERWOOD
                              (severe anxiety, 
                              backing up)
                         No, no, come on, Horton, you know 
                         us, we're not tryin' to muscle in, 
                         you're the man, you call the shots.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         I'm going upstairs now.

                                     UNDERWOOD
                         Sure, Horton, sure. So, same time 
                         for drinks tonight, huh Horton?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Why not, Mr. Underwood?

               They look at each other uncertainly. Wally-as-Horton exits 
               up a rear stairway and the room comes back to life. Underwood 
               returns to the table full of Gangsters.

                                     GANGSTER #1
                              (an Italian)
                         What'd he say?

                                     UNDERWOOD
                              (talking tough)
                         Something stinks, big. Pew. He kept 
                         calling my Mr. Underwood.

                                     GANGSTER #2
                              (a Black guy)
                         That's your name.

               Underwood twists Gangster #2's nose.

                                     UNDERWOOD
                         Mr. Schmaty Pants: my name's Jimmy! 
                         That guy, maybe he's been on top too 
                         long. Lemme tell you something; the 
                         bigger they are, the harder they 
                         fall.
                              (the Gangsters mutter 
                              agreement)
                         Hey Vinnie, how 'bout a round a' 
                         cheeseburgers?

                                     GANGSTER #3
                              (a Mexican guy)
                         Con mucho queso.

               The other Gangsters grunt their approval.

                                     VINNIE
                              (in front of the open 
                              fridge)
                         Sorry, gents, looks like we're fresh 
                         outta cheese.

               The Gangsters raise a ruckus, each in his own dialectical 
               style.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINNIE'S SECOND FLOOR - DAY

               Wally-as-Horton reaches the top of the stairs. Mr. Biggs 
               steps out of the shadows, flanked by two big BODYGUARDS in 
               Company "B" jumpsuits. Their heads are bobbing like Bert and 
               Mel's were before they peed at the airport.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         So? Has the deed been done?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                              (fearfully thinking 
                              on his feet)
                         I'm going to march right out there 
                         and engage the enemy.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         Every second that genius' brain is 
                         working for Company "A", a fog of 
                         trouble engulfs our enterprise in a 
                         cloud of uncertainty.
                              (moves closer)
                         One twenty-five cent bullet, Mr. 
                         Thuraby, delivered in a timely 
                         fashion, will spell victory for 
                         Company "B"

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         And I'll bet there's no butts about 
                         it.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         I think we understand each other.

               Mr. Biggs heads down the stairs, followed by his bobbing 
               Bodyguards. Wally-as-Horton quickly ducks into the door of 
               Horton's apartment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HORTON'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Wally-as-Horton shuts the door, leans back against it, gulping 
               air. He turns on a light and finds himself staring at two 
               huge gun racks, one for rifles, one for pistols. Wally-as-
               Horton hyperventilates, terrorized. He takes off his jacket 
               and is shocked to see himself wearing an empty shoulder 
               holster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Horton-as-Wally pulls into the driveway in Wally's car. He 
               gets out, heads for the front door. We hear the ferocious 
               yapping of Gucci-Gucci the Pekingese and a moment later it 
               bursts through the underbrush and makes a beeline for Horton-
               as-Wally. Horton-as-Wally turns and his gaze narrows 
               menacingly just as Gucci-Gucci leaps up at his face for the 
               kill.

               In mid-flight, the look in Horton-as-Wally's eyes register 
               in Gucci-Gucci's little mind. Gucci-Gucci puts on the brakes 
               and stops in mid-air, inches from Horton-as-Wally's face, 
               lingers there a moment, then retreats along the same 
               trajectory, with a squeal of total capitulation.

               Gucci-Gucci rolls over and surrenders, begging for mercy. 
               Horton-as-Wally snaps his fingers. Gucci-Gucci leaps up into 
               his arms and obsequiously slathers Horton-as-Wally's face 
               with Gucci-Gucci devotion.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                              (to Gucci-Gucci)
                         In China they eat dogs.

               Gucci-Gucci freezes and puts its paws over its eyes.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Lucky for you we're not in China.

               Horton-as-Wally drops Gucci-Gucci and enters the house. Gucci-
               Gucci heels after him like a dog with a PhD from Rin-Tin-tin 
               University.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WALLY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Horton-as-Wally enters. With an Apache war whoop, Gordie 
               leaps around a corner, pointing a toy pistol at Horton-as-
               Wally. With reflexes faster than a jungle cat, Horton-as-
               Wally whips out his huge, chrome-plated .357 Magnum, puts 
               the barrel against Gordie's forehead and kicks his legs out 
               from under him. Gordie hits the floor like a sack of rocks, 
               Horton-as-Wally kicks the toy pistol away, puts his foot on 
               Gordie's neck and bends Gordie's nose back with the Magnum.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Didn't anyone ever tell you it's 
                         dangerous to play with firearms?

               Gordie is shocked into a semi-coma of terror, whimpering 
               like a lost baby seal. We hear Polly coming before she turns 
               the corner.

                                     POLLY
                         Wally, did you remember to pick up 
                         the cheese for the wine and cheese --
                              (she turns the corner 
                              and sees them)
                         WALLY!!! GET OFF MY CHILD THIS 
                         INSTANT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!! I'LL 
                         KNOCK YOU INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
                         WEEK!!!

               Horton-as-Wally's head slowly turns towards her like a 
               robot's. His cold steel eyes meet hers.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What did you say?

                                     POLLY
                         YOU ARE IN SERIOUS, SERIOUS TROUBLE, 
                         MISTER!! I'LL SPANK YOUR BOTTOM SO 
                         HARD YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SIT FOR A --

               Horton-as-Wally shoots out an arm with the speed of a cobra, 
               snares her adam's apple between his thumb and forefinger and 
               lifts her gently, sliding her up the wall.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         That's... enough.

               She faints dead away. Gordie, afraid to move a muscle, watches 
               them out of the corner of his eye. Gucci-Gucci sits obediently 
               at Horton-as-Wally's feet, wagging its tail and smiling, 
               gazing up at him with blind adoration.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE ROLLER RINK - DAY

               The wheels on the neon skate are revolving slightly faster 
               than the last time we saw them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTONVILLE ROLLER RINK - DAY

               Country-waltz music. The rink has a few dozen skaters, all 
               pushing themselves forward with a strange and somehow familiar 
               bobbing motion. Over at the SKATE CHECK-OUT desk, a sweating, 
               beaming Big Tom is distributing skates to an eager crowd; 
               his ability to supply barely keeping up with demand. We hear 
               comments from the CROWD:

                         Boy, I haven't been skating in 
                         years... you know I must have driver 
                         by this place a hundred times and 
                         this is the first time I even noticed 
                         it was here... hey, Jane, you come 
                         here often?... it's the strangest 
                         thing; I was just standing there 
                         holding the baby and I suddenly got 
                         this urge to skate; I ended up 
                         bringing the baby-sitter... I take a 
                         nine, Big Tom...

               Woody sits at the adding machine, ecstatically cranking out 
               numbers and banking cash.

               INT. ROLLER RINK KITCHEN - DAY

               A bunch of KIDS on skates are clustered around the snack 
               counter, all bobbing their heads. Randy is adding a lump of 
               sugar to a cup of coffee like Madame Curie handling uranium.

                                     THE KIDS
                         Hey, Randy, six Beefy Cheese Louise... 
                         man, I'm so hungry I could eat a 
                         horse... me, too... me three and I 
                         just ate lunch... me, too...

                                     RANDY
                         How many?

                                     THE KIDS
                         SIX!!

               Randy nods and his head starts to bob, somewhat erratically. 
               He goes to the Beefy Cheese Louise fridge, opens it. The 
               patties are brown and naked. No cheese in sight.

               Randy doesn't change his expression. He closes the fridge, 
               paces back and forth, reopens the fridge, looks at the 
               cheeseless patties again and makes a high whining sound.

               We hear three loud beeps from a TRUCK HORN. Big Tom calls 
               out to Woody.

                                     BIG TOM
                         Cheese truck's here.

                         I got it.

               Woody rises, starts towards the back. Randy stares at the 
               fridge, filled with the wonder of life.

                                     RANDY
                         What a coincidence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROLLER RINK LOADING DOCK - DAY

               The Drivers are swinging open the rear doors of the cheese 
               truck. Woody's face falls when he looks inside. The Drivers 
               look at each other, then a Woody.

               The truck is empty. No cheese. White wax paper printed with 
               the words "CHEESE IS MADE FROM MILK" wafts in the breeze.

                                     DRIVER #2
                         That damn truck was filled with 
                         cheese.

                                     DRIVER #1
                         Where's that much cheese gonna go?

                         You want to try to explain this to 
                         me and a barnload of hungry skaters?

               Out of the Drivers shakes his head, gently kicks a rock.

                                     WOODY
                         HMMM??!!

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE HEINZ 57 PLANT - DAY

               We see a banner in the plaza in front of the building:

                                  "WELCOME TO OUR 35 NEW
                              EMPLOYEES FROM LUBBOCK, TEXAS

                                        NUMBER 1"

               A dais is set up under the banner. A relentlessly cheerful 
               HEINZ VICE PRESIDENT is making a speech into a microphone, 
               to the Heinz EMPLOYEES gathered in the plaza.

                                     HEINZ VP
                              (head bobbing slightly)
                         It's the start of a brand new tomorrow 
                         today and what a beautiful day it 
                         is. The sun is shining brightly on 
                         Heinz 57. We've got the welcome mat 
                         out today --

               The microphone picks up a loud rumbling from the VP's stomach.

                                     HEINZ VP
                         -- wo, 'scuse me, guess I'm running 
                         on empty -- good thing for me we've 
                         got the Welcome Lunch out, too.
                              (enthusiastic applause)
                         Good thing for me and for the thirty-
                         five new reasons why Heinz 57 is 
                         Number One. Now I understand you 
                         folks are all from Lubbock, is that 
                         right?

               We now see the thirty-five Chinese acrobats in their Chinese 
               red sweatsuits, standing at the front of the crowd. They all 
               rapidly confer in an obscure Chinese dialect, then a SPOKESMAN 
               steps forward and beams proudly.

               EXT. THE RIALTO THEATRE - DAY

               A STAGEHAND bobs his head while plastering up a bill on a 
               wall outside the theater:

                                      "OPENS TONIGHT
                              THE FABULOUS CHINESE ACROBATS
                                 FROM THE FAR PROVINCES"

               As he finishes a delivery truck pulls up. Lettering on the 
               side reads:

                                 "LIGHTNING FAST CHINESE"

               The non-Chinese Delivery Man gets out, carrying a very large 
               box of Chinese food in the familiar cardboard buckets.

                                     STAGEHAND
                         Weren't you just here?

                         They phoned up for more.

               Off screen we hear a horrendous screeching and squealing. 
               The Delivery man hurries across the street and enters the 
               theater. A moment later the Company "A" limo flies by, 
               lurching and bucking like a harpooned whale.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

               The thirty-five, leisure-suited Texans are spread out all 
               over the stage, wolfing down Chinese food like there's no 
               tomorrow. Empty cardboard buckets litter the area. In b.g., 
               the Delivery Man distributes more buckets from his big box.

               ROGER, the light-in-the-loafers Stage Manager minces on state, 
               bobbing his head in an esthetic way.

                                     ROGER
                              (clapping his hands)
                         All right, girls, chop-chop --
                              (points to his watch)
                         Clockse say time for rehearsee, I'm 
                         not getting any younger, the band's 
                         paid by the hour - down with the 
                         food, on with the tights --

               The Texans stare at him balefully. A large one rises, puts a 
               hand on Roger's shoulder, towering over him and turns to the 
               group.

                                     TEXAN #1
                         What do you think, boys? Should we 
                         kill him?

                                     ROGER
                         Ooh, quell macho behind the Bamboo 
                         Curtain -- Roger read you loud and 
                         clear, you angry Samurai; time to 
                         zippee my lippee.

               He mimes zipping and locking his lips, then throws away the 
               "key". Roger turns to the BAND, in the pit, and mouths the 
               words:

                                     ROGER
                         Play something!

               The Band lurches into a loony Chinese overture. As if 
               hypnotized, all the Texans drop their food containers, run 
               to prearranged spots on the stage, roll their socks up over 
               the bottom of their pants legs and bow to each other.

               Half the troupe leans down and form stirrups with their hands. 
               The other half of the troupe take lumbering runs at them and 
               strain one foot up into the stirrup.

               With agonized, muscle-ripping heaves, the runners are clumsily 
               lifted in unison a few inches into the air and fall as one 
               to the stage, landing on their backs like felled redwoods.

                                     ROGER
                         Ooh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               Doors open and General Conrad is wheeled into the room on a 
               mobile rig. The General wears a full-body cast, stuck in a 
               position like a freeze frame of someone being tossed into a 
               swimming pool.

               The other Generals, seated as before around the table, give 
               low-key, respectful greeting. An AIDE stands behind each of 
               the Generals, holding a stack of computer printout data.

                                     THE GENERALS
                              (variously)

                         see you back in the saddle... guess 
                         you're gonna make that barbecue 
                         Saturday, eh Pappy?

               Colonel Mofler rises as General Conrad reaches the table, in 
               the middle of an extremely long slow burn.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                              (low, angry, controlled)
                         Tell me about the fish.

                         Sir, that tuna's been gaffed and 
                         he's coming on deck now --

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         What've we got!!

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                              (a look to the other 
                              Generals)

                         confined.

                              again)
                         Confined to the limits of one small 
                         town.

                         Newtonville, Kansas.

               Long pause.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         That's IT??!! We're talking about 
                         fist piss, what the hell did it DO??!!

               Mofler looks at the Generals again, then at his notes.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Uh, possible impact on basic metabolic 
                         processes. Negative, uh, infringement 
                         on calcium and magnesium molecular 
                         structures. Uh, very likely some 
                         compulsive hyperkinetic rebalancing --

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         CUT THE CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU TELL 
                         ME, COLONEL, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE 
                         PULLING UP ON DECK!!

               Another look at the Generals.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Well, Sir, there's one thing we can 
                         say for certain; Newtonville sure as 
                         hell isn't going to have any cheese.

               Silence. General Conrad tightens. His face turns the color 
               of borscht. SOUND of plaster straining. Hairline cracks appear 
               up and down the General's body cast. Strangulated moaning 
               escapes from the General as the cast shatters and he falls 
               out of view like a man going through a trapdoor.

               The Generals shake their heads in admiration. They clench 
               their cigars, summoning up the Stuff for the ordeal that 
               clearly lies ahead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WALLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               In Gordie's room, Horton-as-Wally pounds the final nail into 
               the last in a wall full of professional looking gun racks. 
               The others are already loaded with Gordie's toy weapons. 
               Horton-as-Wally turns to Gordie.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Load 'er up.

               Gordie loads the rest of his toys into the rack.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         How many rounds in a Luger magazine?

                                     GORDIE
                         Nine, Sir.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What's the range on that Kalishnikov?

                                     GORDIE
                         Accurate to three-hundred yards, 
                         Sir.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Do you ever point a loaded weapon at 
                         another human being if you don't 
                         intend to use it?

                                     GORDIE
                         No, Sir, never, Sir.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         That's good, Gordon. Tomorrow we're 
                         going to talk about hand-to-hand 
                         techniques. Now go tell your Mother 
                         we're ready to eat.

                                     GORDIE
                         Yes, Sir, I sure am hungry.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         You and me both, Junior.

               Gordie exits happily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WALLY NEWTON'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               As Horton-as-Wally enters, Polly, wearing a blond, plastic 
               neck brace, is setting out large amounts of food on the table, 
               where Gordie's eagerly seated, his head bobbing.

                                     POLLY
                              (her voice strangely 
                              Munchkined)
                         Wally, I don't appreciate one little 
                         bit being told by Gordie that you're 
                         ready to --

               Horton-as-Wally sits down, calmly takes out his Magnum and 
               sets it on the table beside his plate. Polly inhales her 
               next word and immediately sits. Gordie stares directly at 
               Horton-as-Wally in a trance of admiration.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Dig in, Gordon. You'll need plenty 
                         of energy when we go hand-to-hand.

               Polly's impulse to interrogate is just barely contained by 
               her sheer terror. Gordie starts to eat, still gazing 
               worshipfully at Horton-as-Wally.

                                     POLLY
                         Wally, you'll remember we're having 
                         the wine and cheese get-together 
                         tomorrow evening and I'll need you 
                         to pick --
                              (he shoots her a look)
                         -- to remind me to pick up the wine 
                         and cheese in the morning.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                              (nods, then to Gordie)
                         If we had some cheese, we could have 
                         a wine and cheese party, if we had 
                         some wine.

               Gordie cracks up. He loves his dad so much now.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Son, you're bobbing like a boy who 
                         needs a pogo stick. What do you say 
                         we pick one up tomorrow?

                                     GORDIE
                              (thrilled)
                         Gee, Dad, that'd be great -- what's 
                         a pogo stick?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROCKING HORSE ROOM - DAY

               A basketball court sized room, the ceilings almost out of 
               sight. The walls are covered with murals of animals and 
               fantasy lands. A gigantic, electric rocking horse sits in 
               the middle of the room, near a desk where Tidman is emptying 
               the contents of a large, grey sock in front of the seated 
               Professor-as-Newt. Ike and Mike are standing guard nearby. 
               The Professor-as-Newt stares at the objects analytically, on 
               the assumption they hold some hidden, symbolic significance.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (puzzled)
                         Don't you recognize these items, 
                         Master Newt?

               The Professor-as-Newt looks at Tidman, as if to say, "Should 
               I?"

                                     TIDMAN
                         These are the contents of your sock.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         My sock.

                                     TIDMAN
                         That's right --
                              (picking each object 
                              up)
                         This is your rock. This is your piece 
                         of string. This is your pink rubber 
                         pig. This is your record player and 
                         your very own record. See?

               Tidman puts the plastic record on the plastic, toy turntable 
               and turns it on; a frantic, emotional children's SONG plays. 
               Assuming this is all a test of his brilliance, the Professor-
               as-Newt cocks his head like the RCA dog, listening intently. 
               He picks up the rock, scrutinizing it, measuring it with his 
               fingers.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (shrewdly)
                         Instantly I see a relationship to ze 
                         string.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (humoring him)
                         Yes. They were all in the sock.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         All in ze sock?

                                     TIDMAN
                         All... in... the sock.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Ah, a frame of reference.
                              (putting it all 
                              together)
                         The sock... is my universe. I'm going 
                         to need a large chalkboard.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Master Newt, you've come a long, 
                         long way.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Halfway around the world.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Yes. Of course

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD - NIGHT

               As the curtain opens on the small stage, BLACK MUSICIANS are 
               playing an introductory, three-chord blues riff. Jimmie 
               Underwood and his cronies are seated over drinks in their 
               booth at the back. Vinnie comes out on stage and takes the 
               microphone.

                                     VINNIE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me 
                         great pleasure to introduce one of 
                         the great legends of the blues, it's 
                         his first visit here to the Lightning 
                         Rod, direct from Gainesville, Florida, 
                         the one and only Stompin' Machine, 
                         Sammy "the Stomp" Johnson!

               Round of applause, whistles. Jimmie and his group stomp their 
               feet and yell, heads bobbing in unison: the stomping spreads 
               around the room. The musicians start to stomp, the beat is 
               picked up and amplified by the bass drum. A spotlight hits 
               the stage and out stomps Alice-as-Sammy-the-Stomp, wearing a 
               baggy, blue-sequined suit, a purple pearlescent silk shirt, 
               white bucks and a black string tie. The audience immediately 
               accepts her at face value and the applause-o-meter shoots 
               into the danger zone.

               Alice-as-Sammy-the-Stomp, sounding like a bizarro mixture of 
               B.B. King and Princess Di, skillfully sings a blues standard 
               with a great deal of conviction, passion and diction.

               Through the beaded curtain at the back, Wally-as-Horton enters 
               the Rod, scans the room, spots Jimmie and company and makes 
               his way to their booth.

                                     GANGSTER #3
                         Hey, Horton, where's Lorraine?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Lorraine?

               Jimmie backhands Gangster #3 across the nose.

                                     JIMMIE
                         What the hell business is it of yours 
                         where she is?
                              (to Wally-as-Horton)
                         Guy's got a deathwish, huh Horton? 
                         You gotta forgive a knothead like 
                         this.

               The Gangsters scrunch together to make room for Wally-as-
               Horton to join them in the booth. They watch Alice-as-Sammy-
               the-Stomp finish her number. Applause.

               Under which, Lorraine teeters in on stiletto heels, dressed 
               in a clinging, cocktail sheath dress, with a slit up the 
               side halfway to Duluth. She leans down and gives Wally-as-
               Horton a big wet kiss.

                                     LORRAINE
                         Sorry I'm late.

               Wally-as-Horton's eyes roll back, close to losing 
               consciousness.

                                     LORRAINE
                         What are you doin' sittin' with these 
                         creeps?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         They're going to give me a drink.

                                     LORRAINE
                         You mean a Mickey.

                                     JIMMY
                         Lighten up, Lorraine, you gonna stop 
                         a man from buying a man a drink in 
                         this oh-by-gosh-by-golly world?

                                     LORRAINE
                         Who me?
                              (she sits)

                                     JIMMY
                         If you're not gonna stop me...
                              (Jimmy winks at the 
                              others)
                         ...then I'm not gonna stop you. I 
                         can't stop you. And if I can't stop 
                         you, then --

                                     THE OTHER GANGSTERS
                              (stupid singing)
                         -- "who'll stop Lorraine?"

               On stage, Alice-as-Sammy-the-Stomp overhears the gangsters 
               and interpreting it as a request, launches the band into a 
               tight, explosive cover of CCR's "Who'll Stop the Rain?"

               Jimmy raises his wine glass.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'd like to propose a toast...

               Wally-as-Horton, Lorraine and the other Gangsters raise their 
               wine glasses.

                                     JIMMY
                         To Mr. Horton Thuraby, the fastest 
                         gun in the west, with all good wishes

               They wait to see if he's finished. Wally-as-Horton leans way 
               forward, forms a perfect "O" with his lips, attaches his 
               lips to the glass and makes like the babbling brook. The 
               others look at him like he just flew in from Mars. He 
               continues to make the sound.

               The Gangsters and Lorraine look at each other. Cautiously, 
               they all lean forward and duplicate Wally-as-Horton's wine 
               tasting technique. The band stops playing, all eyes turn to 
               the booth. The sound of the babbling brook continues.

               Stripping receipts off the spindle nearby, Woody grimaces 
               and pulls on his hair.

               Wally-as-Horton is half in the bag, leading them in singing 
               a mutilated version of "Strangers in the Night". They stop 
               outside the door to Horton's apartment. Wally-as-Horton

                         can get that big engine of your's

               We HEAR a rapid thumping, increasing in volume and intensity 
               and Wally-as-Horton's shirt starts to kick out like he's 
               hiding a mule undergoing shock treatment in his chest.

               She opens the door and pulls him by the tie into the dark 
               apartment. The door closes. From inside, we hear Wally-as-
               Horton's heart beating faster.

               The early morning sun illuminates the "Welcome to Newtonville" 
               sign. Parked behind the sign in his patrol car, Dougy 
               "Sherlock" Watson is catching some Z's. His head bobs slightly 
               in his sleep.

               In the distance we hear the grinding and screeching of the 
               Company A" limo as it tears down the highway and roars past 
               the sign. "Sherlock" Watson wakes up like someone just poured 
               ice water in his shorts and sees the limo racing away. He 
               starts the engine, hits the siren and screeches out onto the 
               highway, bubble lights flashing, chasing the limo.

               CAMERA holds on the sign. A few moments later, the patrol 
               car zooms back past the sign in reverse, the limo gaining on 
               his front bumper. "Sherlock" Watson testing the envelope of 
               landspeed-backwards travel.

               The wretched whine of tortured engines fades. Lightning 
               strikes the desert in background. Moments later, what seems 
               to be a sandstorm erupts in the dry desert around the sign. 
               Descending into this maelstrom, we see a contorted, white 
               apparition attached to a harness on a cable; General Conrad, 
               in a new plaster body cast.

               As he nears the ground, two troop carriers and a jeep speed 
               into frame, combat-ready GROUND TROOPS pour out and lower 
               General Conrad into a steel-tube scaffolding that allows him 
               to stand in the back of the jeep. He's strapped in, a 
               microphone in front of his face and large speakers on either 
               side of him.

               During above, the Generals with the Right Stuff and Colonel 
               Mofler arrive in a fleet of staff cars and three more 
               transports disgorge three companies of Marines.

               Newt-as-the Professor takes his plastic record player out of

               A beautiful summer morning. Horton-as-Wally drives up, parks 
               beside the sales office and heads inside. He feels like 
               whistling and gets out a note before catching himself. He 
               enters the sales office.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LUCKY BUCK'S SALES OFFICE - DAY

               As Horton-as-Wally enters, Lucky Buck gestures to him from 
               behind his desk.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         Soldier, First Bugle's at 0900 hours, 
                         I'd like you to take a good long 
                         look at your timepiece, bedbug, and 
                         give me one good reason why I 
                         shouldn't dock you three minutes 
                         wages. You're a slacker, a slouch; 
                         the original sadsack.

               Horton-as-Wally, motionless, stares at this creature in 
               disbelief. A twinge of uneasiness filters down to Lucky Buck's 
               cortex but he shakes it off, crooks a finger and summons 
               Horton-as-Wally.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         Walk that butt of yours right over 
                         here. Private, I want to show you 
                         what put me off my breakfast this 
                         morning.

               Horton-as-Wally, stoking a nuclear powered slow burn, ambles 
               over to the desk, under...

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         The most pitiful, the most sickening 
                         and embarrassing sales record it's 
                         ever been my misfortune to encounter. 
                         We're talking court martial. 
                         Dishonorable discharge.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What did you say?

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                              (on micro-thin ice)
                         I said if this was Japan and I were 
                         to hand you the hari-kari blade and 
                         you were anything but the most 
                         miserable excuse for a man in this 
                         outfit --

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         That's enough.

               Horton-as-Wally reaches out, grips Lucky Buck by the Adam's 
               apple and puts him gently against the wall and speaks calmly.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         The things you've been saying and 
                         this attitude you're expressing 
                         towards me are unacceptable. You 
                         will never do this again.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                              (up about two octaves)
                         I agree completely.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Fine. Let's sell some cars.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         I'm all for it.

               Horton-as-Wally releases Lucky Buck. Lucky Buck tells his 
               trembling, uncooperative facial muscles to smile, but the 
               result looks like the mouth of a catfish in a wind tunnel.

                                     LUCKY BUCK
                         Thank you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROCKING HORSE ROOM - DAY

               Tidman enters, with Ike and Mike behind him. The Professor-
               as-Newt sits at his desk, contemplating the contents of the 
               sock laid carefully out on the desktop, deeply lost in 
               thought. A large, blank blackboard stands at the ready.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Good morning, Master Newt.

               No response. The Professor-as-Newt doesn't budge, doesn't 
               blink.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Sleep well, did you? Master Newt? 
                         Master Newt?

               Tidman touches the Professor-as-Newt's shoulder. The Professor-
               as-Newt snaps out of his reverie and looks up at Tidman.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (instantly alert)
                         Vhat kind of day is it? Is it a cloudy 
                         day? Or is it a pleasant day?

                                     TIDMAN
                         It's a pleasant day, Master Newt.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         That's good.
                              (they smile at each 
                              other)
                         You're the fellow who was in here 
                         before.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Yes, I'm Tidman.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Tidman. You'll understand if I return 
                         to my work now.

               He turns back to the desktop. Tidman looks at Ike and Mike, 
               sighs.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Master Newt... it's time for your 
                         morning bath.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (getting aggravated)
                         Please, kind sir, can't you see... I 
                         am this close --
                              (holds up thumb and 
                              forefinger)
                         -- this close -- these symbols are 
                         swimming, swarming in my mind like 
                         your bumblebees I've heard so much 
                         about -- what pulls and pushes is 
                         looking more and more like the 
                         interwoven fibers of the SOCK!!

                                     TIDMAN
                              (a pause, sternly)
                         Do you see your pig?

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (thinking it's a clue, 
                              excited)
                         Yes?

                                     TIDMAN
                         You're just as dirty as a pig.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (eager to know more)
                         I am? What does this mean?

                                     TIDMAN
                         It's time to see your Grandfather... 
                         it's time for your bath.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (a new tangent)
                         Dirt... water... like a MEMBRANE!!

               Tidman motions to Ike and Mike. They pick the Professor-as-
               Newt up by the arms and carry him towards the door.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Master Newt?

               They stop. The Professor-as-Newt looks back at him.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (holding it up)
                         Don't you want to bring your pig?

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (considers)
                         Vell, yes. I suppose I do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTON MANOR BATH ROOM - DAY

               Ike and Mike carry the Professor-as-Newt, who's cradling his 
               pig, into the Roman bath-sized room. Tidman follows. Ike and 
               Mike wear regular bathing suits and t-shirts. The Professor-
               as-Newt is wearing a 1890's style bathing suit. Also wearing 
               the same style suit, GRANDAD NEWTON, an ancient, shriveled 
               version of Newt, stands unsteadily in the far end of the 
               steamy, swimming pool sized bathtub. On the back of both 
               their suits are the words:

                                 "LONG DISTANCE SWIMMER"

               Ike and Mike carry the Professor-as-Newt down steps into the 
               bath and drop him kitty-korner from Grandad. Tidman announces:

                                     TIDMAN
                         Grandad, Master Newt is here.

               Grandad looks at the Professor-as-Newt, shakes his head.

                                     GRANDAD
                         That's not Newt.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Don't be mean, Grandad, Newt's come 
                         such a long way to see you. And I'll 
                         bet he'd love to hear your record; 
                         wouldn't you like to play it for 
                         him?

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         I would like to hear your record. 
                         Does it have any bearing on the pig? 
                         Or perhaps, dirt or a membrane of 
                         some kind?

               Grandad smiles warmly; he likes this guy even if it isn't 
               Newt and he's the only one who realizes it. Grandad reaches 
               out of the pool and turns on his plastic record player, 
               similar to the one from the sock. We hear a sweet, tender, 
               warm-hearted song. As it plays, Grandad takes out his own 
               pink rubber pig and starts to suds it up with a little brush. 
               The Professor-as-Newt watches him intently, smiling when 
               Granada smiles at him.

                                     GRANDAD
                         Clean pig.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (aha, another clue)
                         A... clean... pig.

               The Professor-as-Newt starts to scrub his pig. Using long-
               handled brushes, Ike and Mike begin scrubbing down Grandad 
               and the Professor-as-Newt. Tidman steals behind a column and 
               sneaks a smoke.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AIRPORT - DAY

               Moving off a clock that reads 12:33, we see Hank the Barber 
               exit the Barber Shop and move to the newsstand. He picks up 
               a newspaper and hands it to the Cashier.

                                     CASHIER
                         The Hank, usual?

                                     HANK THE BARBER
                         Bet you.

               The Cashier takes the paper, opens the cash register drawer 
               and tries to stuff the newspaper inside. Meanwhile, Hank 
               unwraps a candy bar and smears it in a tight circle on his 
               forehead, near the third eye area. The Cashier takes out a 
               handful of nickels and dimes, holds out his arm and throws 
               the coins onto the corridor floor. The Barber and the Cashier 
               stare at each other with a look of complete blankness. The 
               Barber spins violently and storms back to the Barbershop.

               Moving off them we find General Conrad, Colonel Mofler and 
               the other Generals observing the exchange. A SOLDIER 
               approaches, urgently.

                                     SOLDIER
                         General, if you'd like to follow me.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         What is it?

                                     SOLDIER
                         I think we've got a nibble.

               They quickly follow the Soldier, Mofler and the other Generals 
               carrying General Conrad to the baggage claim area. The 
               carousel has been roped off and a number of SOLDIERS are 
               crawling around, carrying weird, Geiger-counter-like devices, 
               all glowing and emitting whooping noises.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         You smell that, Mofler?

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         What's that, Sir?

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Tuna piss.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Yes, Sir. Ground Zero.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Mofler, you know what happens when 
                         tuna goes bad?

               Mofler nods, apprehensive, as the other Generals gather round.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD

                         his barnacles scraped in drydock if 
                         that happens.

               Horton-as-Wally walks a slow, rheumatic LITTLE OLD LADY firmly 
               by the elbow through the lot. As her head bobs, her eye is 
               drawn to a flashy, sporty convertible.

                                     LITTLE OLD LADY
                         But I'm really kind of partial to 
                         that one --

                         No.

               He stops her in front of a sensible, four-door sedan.

                         This is the car for you.

               They Lady's eye's quiver. We hear a splashing on the tarmac. 
               We see a puddle forming between her orthopedic shoes.

               Jimmie Underwood and the Boys sit around a table, over beers, 
               heads bobbing, deeply troubled.

                         How can you tail a guy who don't go 
                         out of his room?

                                     MEXICAN GANGSTER
                         What are they doing up there?

               They all punch him on the shoulders.

                                     MEXICAN GANGSTERS
                         No, I mean, this ain't like Horton; 
                         he don't mix business with pleasure.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Horton's beginning to act like an 
                         enigma.

               The other Gangsters brush off their sleeves and pick lint 
               off their lapels. Mr. Biggs and his two Bodyguards are 
               eavesdropping on this conversation from the next booth. Mr. 
               Biggs gets up and moves to Jimmie Underwood.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         I couldn't help overhearing what you 
                         gentlemen were discussing. I, too, 
                         have concern with regards to the 
                         behavior of Mr. Horton Thursby. 
                         Perhaps we can find a path through 
                         this thicket of doubt and confusion 
                         to a golden pagoda of mutual 
                         satisfaction.

                                     JIMMIE UNDERWOOD
                         You're Mr. Biggs.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         Indeed I am, Sir. Let's talk turkey.

                                     MEXICAN GANGSTER
                         Con mucho queso.

                                     JIMMIE UNDERWOOD
                         There isn't gonna be any turkey or 
                         cheese. Your deal's with Thursby.

                                     MR. BIGGS
                         Until this moment. I consider it 
                         void for non-performance of services. 
                         Take Thursby out... and the deal is 
                         yours.

               A clock reads: 2:00 PM. Wearing a smile as wide as the 
               Mississippi, Wally-as-Horton lounges between the sheets with 
               Lorraine. Wally-as-Horton sings her a little ditty. She 
               giggles like an adored and adorable schoolgirl.

                         Gosh, of gosh, oh gosh.

               He pinches her nose, then holds up the tip of his thumb 
               between two fingers.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         If I keep this, will it start to 
                         smell?

               She giggles. He kisses her "nose" and puts it "back".

                         Oh, Horton, this is the most romantic 
                         day we've ever spent.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON

               She kisses him tenderly and quickly accelerating passion. 
               Wally-as-Horton's T-shirt starts thumping like a jackhammer.

               A number of dairy cows stand in the field, moving their lips 
               and making an eerie, melodic yodeling. Moving over we find 
               General Conrad, Colonel Mofler and the Generals standing on 
               the edge of the field. Behind them, a mass of Soldiers are 
               standing by. One of the Generals looks through a huge pair 
               of binoculars. Colonel Mofler holds a tape recorder's

               Newt-as-the-Professor lays out the piece of string on the

               in time to the song on the record player.

               low green fluorescent lights. The group of Scientists we saw 
               earlier observing Newt-as-the Professor are seated around 
               the table, watching the monitor with Chairman Delbert Corrigan 
               and his lovely wife, Simone. Bert and Mel are standing quietly 
               in the back near Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice. Everyone watches 
               the monitor intently, heads bobbing, as we hear the tap-tap-
               tapping of Newt-as-the-Professor's rock. A plate of small 
               sandwiches sits in the middle of the table.

               Horton-as-Wally leads Gordie stand in front of the counter 
               where kindly old MISTER ZAP climbs up a tall ladder, pulls a 
               pogo stick down off a shelf and blows off a thick layer of 
               dust.

                                     MISTER ZAP
                              (still on the ladder)
                         Yep. Haven't sold one of these things 
                         in years. Got a back order died on 
                         the shelf. Been clogging up my 
                         inventory since '59. Used to be I'd 
                         see kids bouncing all over Main Street 
                         on these things.
                              (getting carried away)
                         Wished I had a nickel for every one 
                         of these I saw bouncing by my window. 
                         Could'a sold this old shop. Could'a 
                         moved up ta Granny's farm 'fore the 
                         rheumatism took her. Yep, I --

                              from this)
                         That's enough.

               At 8 fps, Mr. Zap zips down the ladder and rings up the sale.

               Regular speed. Horton-as-Wally watches with a smile as Gordie 
               hops on the stick and bounces away down Main Street. A couple 
               of head bobbing KIDS spot Gordie and are thunderstruck with 
               desire for a stick of their own.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROLLER RINK - EVENING

               Sun set over the big skate. The exterior lights come on. The 
               parking lot is jammed with cars and would-be skaters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROLLER RINK - EVENING

               In front of the empty skate dispensing shelves, Big Tom, 
               Woody and Randy stare in amazement at the rink, packed solid, 
               shoulder-to-shoulder with happy skaters, a mass of human 
               flesh traveling around and around.

                                     WOODY
                              (incredulous)
                         This is great business, even for a 
                         Friday.

                         Pinch me, Woody, I think we're 
                         dreaming.

                         total strangers.

               Woody clamps a hand over Randy's mouth.

                         Oh, the sound of many skates on wood.

               CLOSEUPS of many skates thunderously wheeling around the 
               rink.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton-as-Wally scrutinizes pairs of polyester-clad GUESTS 
               entering the house for the wine and cheese party, each 
               carrying a bottle of wine. Polly greets them at the door and 
               they all pointedly ignore Horton-as-Wally.

                                     GUESTS AND POLLY
                              (variously)
                         We were so fortunate to find this 
                         last dusty little bottle... Ted's so 
                         silly he thought Neuf de Pape was 
                         the sound champagne made when you 
                         opened it... we thought you'd like 
                         this adorable burgundy... I've read 
                         about it; it's ingratiating without 
                         being impudent...

               Polly glances over at Horton-as-Wally. He's just turned the 
               heat up on his slow burn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RIALTO THEATER - NIGHT

               Thunderous applause from the packed house, among them some 
               soldiers, watching strategically. A spot comes up on Mayor 
               Billy Benson as he walks out on stage. Watching from a gold 
               circle box on the mezzanine level are General Conrad, Colonel 
               Mofler and the other Generals.

                                     MAYOR BILLY BENSON
                         Thank you, thank you and welcome, 
                         one and all.
                              (his hand is bobbing 
                              erratically)
                         Before I introduce the illustrious 
                         Chinese Acrobats I have an important 
                         announcement to make.
                              (the crowd hushes)
                         During the last twenty-four hours I, 
                         Mayor Billy Benson, have struggled 
                         mightily with the questions and issues 
                         weighing heavily on all our minds in 
                         these, our troubled times. Ladies 
                         and gentlemen, Atlas did not shrug.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                              (whispers to Mofler)
                         Where's my bozo gun?

                                     MAYOR BILLY BENSON
                         And so it is tonight, with a heart 
                         filled with joy and promise, that I 
                         am announcing my candidacy for the 
                         office of President of these United 
                         States of America.

               Dead silence. Benson twitches, salutes sharply and strides 
               off.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Drop a net on that one, Mofler.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         He's got trout farm written all over 
                         him.

               The band strikes up the Chinese overture. Lights dim. Curtains 
               open. To tumultuous applause the thirty-five Texans stride 
               out and take a bow.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                              (squinting)
                         Kind'a big for Chinese.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                         Maybe the stage is small.

               A steady drum bead-roll, the Texans scramble back and, 
               paunches straining, begin to form a massive, five-tiered 
               human pyramid.

               Roger, the stage manager, watches from the wings, crossing 
               all his fingers and biting a nail, as his head bobs.

               The men of the last tier climb precariously up to complete 
               the clumsiest and least graceful human pyramid in recorded 
               history. The bottom tier starts to shake and shimmy; the 
               keystone Man's knees start to buckle. The tiers sag inwards 
               towards the middle. With a look of eye-popping strain, the 
               keystone Man farts. A split-second later, another first-tier 
               Texan rips a cheese-cutter and the Pyramid collapses like a 
               dynamited housing project.

                                     ROGER
                              (averting his eyes)
                         Chinese food. Ix-nay on the Chinese 
                         food.

               INT. VINNIE'S BACKSTAIRS - NIGHT

               Wally-as-Horton and Lorraine come down the stairs, happily 
               glued to each other. They enter the main room of the Rod. 
               CUSTOMERS are wolfing down huge portions of Vinnie's bad 
               food. Jimmie and the Gangsters, seated at a table in the 
               middle of the room, all rise, apprehensive, on edge. Vinnie 
               approaches.

                         For food, that is, but not for 
                         anything else.

                                     VINNIE
                         Two deluxe dinners, coming right up.

                              (strained)
                         Have a seat with us, Horton. We've 
                         got plenty of room.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Gee, thanks, Mr. Underwood.

               The other Gangsters back away from the table, as Wally-as-
               Horton and Lorraine take a seat. Vinnie sets down two sticky 
               plates full of undifferentiated sludge.

                                     VINNIE
                         Buon appetito!
                              (he moves off)

               The other Gangsters sit down again. Wally-as-Horton feels 
               some tension and starts to get nervous. Jimmie Underwood 
               moves behind Wally-as-Horton into the shadows. High 
               violin/rash music fades in, as Wally-as-Horton's rash starts 
               to bedevil him. He moves his left are uncomfortably as he 
               starts to eat.

                              danger)
                         Horton, something's not right.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Yeah, this food is terrible.

                                     LORRAINE
                         No. Where's Jimmie?

               Behind them, in the shadows, Jimmie Underwood slowly draws a 
               pistol from his jacket. His itch intensifying, Wally-as-Horton 
               reaches into his jacket to scratch his rash. The Other 
               Gangsters dive lean back, expecting the worse. As Wally-as-
               Horton scratches his rash he accidentally discharges the 
               Magnum in his shoulder holster. BANG!

               The bullet shoots a hole in Wally-as-Horton's jacket, 
               ricochets off the metal chairleg, flies up and knocks the 
               gun out of Jimmie Underwood's hand. Wally-as-Horton spins 
               around. The other Gangsters dive under the table and the 
               rest of the room takes cover.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Oh geez, Mr. Underwood, I'm so sorry, 
                         are you okay?

                         cook better than that. In fact I 
                         could cook a lot better than that.

               Silence. The other Gangsters stare at him in bewilderment 
               and fear.

                         Some of the world's greatest cooks 
                         are men. Maybe Vinnie will let you 
                         boys cook something.

                                     CUSTOMERS
                              (variously)
                         Anything'd be better than this slop... 
                         let 'em cook... hey, Vinnie, let 'em 
                         cook!
                              (stomping as they 
                              shout)
                         Let them cook! Let them cook! Let 
                         them cook!

                              the chant)
                         They can cook! They can cook!

                         Whadda ya say, Hort?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Let's cook!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WALLY NEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The entire room full of Guests, and Polly, are doing the 
               "babbling brook". Horton-as-Wally watches them in disgusted 
               disbelief. A Guest with thick glasses turns to Horton-as-
               Wally.

                                     THICK-GLASSES GUEST
                         You're very quiet this evening, Wally.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Yes I am.

               DICK, a big, mean Sportsman, has heard this exchange.

                                     DICK
                         I suppose it's a little past your 
                         bedtime, huh Wally?

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         No. I just want to make sure Polly 
                         enjoys her party.

               Within earshot, Polly smiles, enormously pleased, then starts 
               offering a tray full of turgid treats around the room.

                                     POLLY
                         Cheese substitute? Cheese substitute?

               A Second Sportsman Guest, HAL, slightly looped and smelling 
               a bit of fun, moves next to Dick, near Horton-as-Wally.

                                     HAL
                         Dick and I were wondering if you'd 
                         sold your first car yet, Wally.

                                     DICK
                         Yeah, how long you been working there, 
                         'bout fifteen years now, isn't it? 
                         You're headed for the Guiness Book 
                         of World Records there, Wally boy.

               A moment of tense silence.

                                     POLLY
                         Dick, I'll have you know Wally's 
                         sold almost every car on the lot in 
                         the last two days.

                                     HAL
                         There's a sucker born every minute 
                         and even a sucker can get a driver's 
                         license.

                                     POLLY
                              (a bit aglow: can it 
                              be love?)
                         Well, I'm very proud of Wally. Lucky 
                         Buck's make him a full partner.

                                     DICK
                         I guess Lucky Buck threw himself on 
                         too many grenades.

                                     POLLY
                              (sees the bumblebees 
                              in Horton's eyes)
                         Dick? Are you trying to provoke Wally?

                                     DICK
                         Full partner? Selling cars? Is Polly 
                         weaning you, Wally boy?

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Excuse me?

                                     DICK
                         Thought for sure there'd be a little 
                         rubber nipple on your glass there 
                         tonight. You know; per usual.

               A buzzing like twelve cubic yards of killer bees fills the 
               room. A row of nervous female GUESTS "babble brook" their 
               wine.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What did you say?

                                     DICK
                         You heard me, Wimpy --

               Horton-as-Wally throws a six-inch uppercut that puts Dick 
               twelve block down on "Queer Street". Hal moves three 
               centimeters towards Horton-as-Wally and one punch later finds 
               himself on the floor, looking for his eye-teeth.

               In one fluid motion Horton-as-Wally whips out the Magnum and 
               fires a single shot down the row of female Guests, severing 
               the stem of their wine glasses. The wine empties onto the 
               carpet like sand through an hour glass.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Goodnight.

               At 8 fps the room empties out the front door. Returning to 
               normal speed, Horton-as-Wally holsters the Magnum. Polly 
               points a not-entirely-angry finger at him.

                                     POLLY
                         Wally Newton!

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                              (responding in kind)
                         Polly Newton!

               He grabs her, spanks her once playfully. She spanks him back 
               and giggles. He throws her over his shoulder and marches her 
               upstairs to you-know-where.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GORDIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Little Gordie sleeps peacefully, a blissful smile on his 
               face, as he cradles his precious pogo stick.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINNIE'S LIGHTNING ROD KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Wally-as-Horton and Jimmie Underwood are the boys are all in 
               aprons, laboring over different pots and griddles, each 
               eagerly preparing his own specialty, moving in and around 
               each other with precision choreography, taste-testing, 
               pondering, adjusting ingredients. Lorraine is working as 
               Wally-as-Horton's spice gofer.

               Vinnie comes back into the kitchen, carrying a huge stainless 
               steel baking tin.

                                     VINNIE
                         This one big enough, Horton?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         That should do it, what do you think 
                         boys?

               The others nod and continue cooking. Vinnie stands around 
               like a fifth wheel.

                                     VINNIE
                         So, how's it coming along?

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Vinnie, Vinnie don't bug us. We're 
                         working on something that's never 
                         been done before, ever.
                              (to Lorraine)
                         Lorraine, a dash of cardomon seed.
                              (Lorraine complies)

                                     VINNIE
                         Sounds expensive.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Yes it is. We're not gonna lie to 
                         you, Vinnie, but we pull this off 
                         and the Michelin people are gonna 
                         need an extra star to rate this joint.

                                     VINNIE
                         Gee, that's great. Kind of a Meals 
                         on Wheels sort of situation, what 
                         with the tires and the food and all.

               Wally-as-Horton and Jimmie Underwood look at each other.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Not the tire company, Vinnie, this 
                         Michelin is a snob outfit that rates 
                         swanky restaurants and when we're 
                         finished you're goin' right to the 
                         top of the list.

                                     VINNIE
                         Wow.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Now if you can't stand the heat get 
                         out of the kitchen, Vinnie.

                                     VINNIE
                         Boys, you ever see a man my age do 
                         something like this?

               He reaches up, grabs the pot rack and does a one-arm chin 
               up. They stare at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RIALTO THEATER - NIGHT

               The stage is littered with broken crockery. A leisure-suited 
               Texan, socks pulled over his pants to his knees, holds two 
               plates high in the air.

               General Conrad, Colonel Mofler and the Generals, some of 
               whom are dozing, stare on from their box, drifting into a 
               surrealistic haze.

               Drum roll. A fat Texan swings in from the wings, hanging 
               from a trapeze by his knees. He makes a grab for the plates, 
               missing by a good fifteen feet before swinging out of view 
               on the other side of the stage. We hear a faint BARKING from 
               that direction. The Texan on the trapeze zips back into view, 
               twice as fast, zips back again even faster, out of sight. 
               Pause.

               Off screen we hear a cacophony of trash cans and other high 
               quality off-screen crash noises. The empty trapeze swings 
               back in and comes to a stop above the motionless Texan, 
               holding the plates.

               The violin section of the orchestra stands and executes a 
               strange, stringed tremolo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Wally-as-Horton and each of the other Gangsters, wearing 
               large mitten pot-holders, holds the pot that contains each 
               of their specialities over the large baking tin. Lorraine 
               stands by, holding a small container of spice.

                                     JIMMIE UNDERWOOD
                         Give the word, Horton; all our 
                         specialities are ready.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Boys, I have a feeling what we're 
                         doing in this kitchen tonight could 
                         change the course of cooking history.

                                     BLACK GANGSTER
                         The aromas themselves are already 
                         intermingling in a way that makes me 
                         dizzy with excitement.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         On three. One... two... three...

               They all pour their specialties into the baking tin, a 
               bubbling cauldron of hot food.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON
                         Go, Lorraine

               Lorraine dumps the spice into the mix. The mix appears to 
               turn combustible; a cloud of smoke appears and we hear a 
               sound like soft, continuous surf, punctuated by small popping 
               noises. They wave away the smoke and see that the tin is 
               packed with small, attractive green pies.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTON MANOR HALLWAY - TIDMAN'S POV - NIGHT

               Creeping down a hallway, toward Ike and Mike, stationed on 
               either side of the door to the Rocking Horse room. As we 
               approach we hear the SOUND of chalk racing over blackboard.

               Carrying a healthy rum toddy, his fourth, Tidman, in nightcap, 
               flannel nightshirt and slippers nods to Ike and Mike. Mike 
               cracks open the door and we catch a glimpse of the Professor-
               as-Newt scribbling away at a massive blackboard.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                              (to himself, as he 
                              writes)
                         One... clean... pig.

                                     TIDMAN
                              (tipsy, nearly won 
                              over)
                         No lack of energy, our Newt.

               Mike closes the door.

                         extra chalkboards he asked for. Give 
                         him whatever he needs; this is the 
                         first constructive thing Newt has 
                         ever done, we must do all we can to 
                         encourage him.

                              thought occurs, which 
                              he makes light of)
                         Let's hope he's not designing a bomb.

               Tidman toddles away down the corridor, humming snatches of a 
               Cole Porter tune.

               Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice sits in a veddy English Parlor, 
               wearing a flannel nightgown, robe and slippers, sadly sipping 
               a cup of tea. We hear screeching engines, horns and sirens 
               approaching. Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice rises, moves to the 
               curtains, parts them and looks out.

               INTERCUT:

               Bob McNabb, lurches up near the curb in the Company "A" limo, 
               trying to stop, which he's able to do only long enough to 
               make a shaky wave towards his house's window before he's off 
               again like a bullet, flames shooting from the tailpipe. 
               Moments later "Sherlock" Watson follows in his patrol car 
               and close behind him are a couple of Army jeeps.

               Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice dabs at his eyes with a 
               handkerchief and slowly closes the curtains.

               Birds chirp. Sun pours through the window and Gordie's smiling 
               face is visible as he bounces by. Polly lounges luxuriously 
               in bed, sipping coffee. Her smile and the gleam in her eye 
               tell us she's woken up a new woman, as she watches Horton-as-
               Wally curling a barbell in his sleeveless T-shirt and boxer 
               shorts.

               Horton-as-Wally winks at her as he continues to pump. Polly 
               sighs contentedly.

               Blackboards, filled with mathematical scrawlings, line the 
               room. Covered in chalk dust, hair in wild disarray, aflame 
               with the white heat of creative genius, the Professor-as-
               Newt writes away on the last board. Seated in a wheelchair, 
               beside the two record players which are each playing one of 
               the records, Grandad Newton watches the Professor-as-Newt. 
               Ike, Mike and Tidman watch from a portable bar, where Tidman, 
               for fortify himself against the jarring musical confluence, 
               is mixing a second pitcher of martinis.

               The Professor-as-Newt stops to listen to a passage in the 
               music, then writes another equation. The records both end.

               Grandad happily starts both records again. Tidman sighs and 
               pours himself a triple. The Professor-as-Newt waits for the 
               music to catch him up, then writes another equation. He looks 
               at what he's written:

               Grandad takes the needles off the records. Silence. Without 
               his feet leaving the floor, the Professor-as-Newt bounces 
               his butt down onto the floor, then bounces back up into the 
               air, his legs stretching like rubber bands.

               Grandad tugs on Tidman's sleeve, points to the Professor-as-
               Newt.

                         Trouble?
                              (chuckles)
                         If you call a 45% increase in 
                         productivity trouble, we've got plenty 
                         of it. This is one of our new 
                         employees and I can safely say he's 
                         one of the best assistants I've ever 
                         had.

                         Mind if I ask him a few questions?

                         He said his name was Frank Roberts.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Well, Frank, where you from?

                              (eyes narrowing)
                         And you're a citizen of these here 
                         United States of America?

                         Boln and bled.

               General Conrad bites through his cigar. We hear a slurping 
               sound. The Chinese Receptionist is back at her desk, eating 
               a big bowl of chili.

               A number of kids are bouncing around on pogo sticks. Gordie 
               is showing a couple of them how to work their pogo sticks, 
               when he's suddenly pushed down from behind.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         What are you doing, pogo-wimp?

               VICTOR EICHORN, the class bully, stands over Gordie and grabs 
               his pogo stick, flanked by two of his little HENCHMEN. Other 
               kids start to gather around, heads bobbing. Gordie stands 
               back up.

                                     GORDIE
                         I like to pogo. Pogoing is cool.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         You're stupid. Where'd you get this 
                         stupid thing?

                                     GORDIE
                         My dad got it for me.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         Your Dad's the biggest wimp who ever 
                         lived, everyone knows that.

                                     GORDIE
                         That's a lie -- give it back.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         Why don't you make me, pogo-wimp?

                                     GORDIE
                         I'm warning you; I know hand-to-hand.

               Victor and the Henchman chortle menacingly. One of the 
               Henchmen kneels behind Gordie, the other Henchman steps 
               forward to push Gordie backwards. Gordie sidesteps the push 
               and tosses one Henchman over the other.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         Oh yeah?

               Victor steps forward and tries to punch Gordie; Gordie 
               expertly flips him onto his back in the sandbox. The other 
               kids cheer.

                                     OTHER KIDS
                         Yeah!

               A thin, nasty teacher, MISS HENKE, appears out of nowhere 
               and grabs Gordie by the ear, twisting it viciously.

                                     MISS HENKE
                         It looks like I'm going to have to 
                         make an example of you, Gordon.

                                     GORDIE
                         He started it --

                                     MISS HENKE
                         Don't start with your crying and 
                         whimpering, an ugly trait you 
                         inherited from your father.
                              (dragging him towards 
                              the school)
                         Maybe we can beat it out of you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               We see the whole fifth grade class seated, facing the front. 
               WHAP! Gordie is leaning over Miss Henke's desk, while she 
               wields two rulers taped together on him. WHAP! Gordie 
               stoically bears the punishment. WHAP! Victor and his Henchman 
               smile sadistically.

                                     GORDIE
                         I told the truth. This is unfair.

                                     MISS HENKE
                         Life... is unfair.
                              (WHAP!)

                                     GORDIE
                         I'm going to have to tell my Dad 
                         about this.

                                     MISS HENKE
                         Good. You tell him to come see me. I 
                         can use this on even bigger babies. 
                         And I've got a hankie for when big 
                         babies cry.
                              (WHAP!)

               EXT. NEWTONVILLE ROLLER RINK - DAY

               A fleet of Army trucks and SOLDIERS surround the barn. The 
               wheels on the big skate are revolving so fast that real sparks 
               are shooting out with the neon ones. A tremendous roar rises 
               out of the barn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               General Conrad, Colonel Mofler and the Generals watch the 
               solid mass of skaters moving around the rink. Big Tom and 
               Woody are in a quietly ecstatic state of euphoria. The noise 
               from the skate on the rink is nearly deafening. General Conrad 
               notices that small sprays of sawdust are being thrown up 
               from the hardwood rink.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton-as-Wally is on the phone, the slow burn turned up to 
               boil.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         What do you mean tomorrow, Gordie? 
                         You tell her I'll be there in ten 
                         minutes... you bet I believe you, 
                         son, you did the right thing.

               He hangs up, turns to Lucky Buck, busy with a bunch of 
               CUSTOMERS.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Is there a fruit stand nearby?

                         forward march about four doors down.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         I'll be back.

               EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

               A car zooms up, parks next to the school and a seething Horton-
               as-Wally gets out and strides towards the classroom building, 
               carrying a small paper bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GORDIE'S CLASSROOM - DAY

               Gordie is standing in the corner, facing the wall. Horton-as-
               Wally kicks the door open; Miss Henke and the class are 
               stunned. Horton-as-Wally goes right for Miss Henke.

                                     MISS HENKE
                         What is the meaning of this? You 
                         can't just barge in here like --

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                              (a finger in her face)
                         That's enough.

               Horton-as-Wally picks her up with one hand and hangs her on 
               a hook over the blackboard.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Gordie, you can take your seat with 
                         the rest of the kids.

               Gordie does. Horton-as-Wally takes out a switchblade and 
               pops it open. Miss Henke gasps. The class is petrified. Horton-
               as-Wally picks up the two taped rulers from the desk and 
               breaks them in half.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                              (to the kids)
                         There'll be no more beatings in this 
                         classroom.

               Horton-as-Wally takes a big grapefruit out of the paper bag, 
               sets it on the desk and cuts it in half with the switchblade. 
               he picks up half the grapefruit and moves to Miss Henke.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         My boy doesn't lie, sourpuss.

               He grinds the grapefruit into her face, using it as a juicer, 
               then tosses the rind across the room into a trashcan like 
               Magic Johnson. Horton-as-Wally turns to face the class.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         At this moment, I consider myself 
                         the luckiest man on earth. I have a 
                         wonderful son, who doesn't lie, and 
                         he's made me very proud.

               Gordie runs up and embraces Horton-as-Wally with all his 
               might.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                              (snidely)
                         I think I'm gonna puke.

               Horton-as-Wally turns to Victor.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Victor, come up here.

               Frightened, Victor stands and moves to them.

                                     VICTOR EICHORN
                         You're not the boss a' me.

                                     HORTON-AS-WALLY
                         Calm down, son.
                              (a hand on Victor's 
                              shoulder)
                         Victor, I know what a hard life you've 
                         lived, what with your folks divorce 
                         and your father's alcoholism. It 
                         wasn't so long ago that I didn't 
                         know the meaning of a family either. 
                         Victor, I know about the loneliness, 
                         lying awake at night, feeling like 
                         no one in the world cares for you. I 
                         know what this can do to you; the 
                         rage and frustration. And I just 
                         want you to understand you've got a 
                         friend here and his name is Wally 
                         Newton. You're welcome at our house, 
                         Gordie's and mine and Polly's, 
                         anytime, day or night, for good food 
                         or hand-to-hand lessons and for just 
                         going out to the range with an Uzi 
                         or a thirty-ought-six.
                              (Victor's dissolved 
                              in helpless tears)
                         Now you characters shake hands and 
                         call it square.

               Gordie extends a hand. Victor shakes it. The class cheers

               of supplies past a worried House Staff through the double

               The Professor-as-Newt is working frantically on a scaffolding 
               that surrounds the superstructure of a huge, black, steel 
               Trojan pig (as in Trojan horse). A steady steam of Delivery 
               men dolly in and deposit their loads under the supervision 
               of a tipsy Tidman. Ike and Mike are lifting heavy objects 
               and other members of the House Staff are joyfully engaged in 
               various support activities. Grandpa sits in his wheelchair 
               near the scaffolding, beaming up at the Professor-as-Newt.

               The "pig" is completely finished. Tidman and the Staff stand 
               back and gaze at it in wondrous admiration. High up on the 
               scaffolding, Ike and Mike help the Professor-as-Newt pour a 
               smoking liquid into a funnel on the end of the coiled copper 
               "tail". Down on the floor, Grandad wheels himself away from 
               the staff, towards a small red button on the "pig's" 
               underbelly.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Don't pour too quickly. This stuff 
                         will come back up at you and burn 
                         your hands off at the elbow...
                              (as they finish)
                         Very nicely done. Now we can climb 
                         down and take some liquid refreshment.

               Ike and Mike start to climb down. The Professor-as-Newt spots 
               Grandad down below, about to touch the small red button.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Grandad, you mustn't touch that, no, 
                         no.

               Grandad smiles and points at the red button.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         Move away, move away now -- Tidman, 
                         if Grandad were to touch that button, 
                         that would be very bad.

               The Professor-as-Newt comes down the scaffolding, as Tidman 
               and the whole Staff cautiously move towards Grandad, who 
               holds his finger next to the button.

                                     TIDMAN AND STAFF

                         Grandad, don't touch the button... 
                         that's a no-no... bad to push the 
                         button, Grandad, mustn't push the 
                         button...

               Grandad pushes the button. We hear a click, then a roar like 
               a blast furnace inside the "pig". A panel slides open and a 
               readout appears, counting down from: 10:00:00.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT
                         I'm so sorry he did that. That's 
                         very bad.

                         Surely you can turn whatever it is 
                         off, Master Newt.

                         Once you light the plutonium, pffft.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT

                         And how big is your bomb, Master 
                         Newt?

               slides out. The other panel opens, a countdown begins: 
               00:05:00. As the countdown proceeds we notice a large yellow 
               mass looming up behind the satellite. We notice a number of 
               "CHEESE IS MADE FROM MILK" wrappers melded into the mass. It 
               silently sails past the satellite.

               with the Delivery Men dollying tons of stuff into both 
               buildings.

               The Company "A" limo with Bob McNabb at the wheel skids into 
               view, weaving in and out between the trucks, sending Delivery 
               Men and their loads skyward. In hot pursuit are "Sherlock" 
               Watson in the patrol car and the army jeeps.

               Mr. Biggs looks down at the trucks through a pair of 
               binoculars, follows a dolly into Company "A", looks up through 
               the binoculars and sees Delbert Corrigan looking at him 
               through a pair of binoculars from Company "A" window. They 
               look at each other through the binoculars for a while.

               The Bodyguards pull out pistols and point them at Wally-as-
               Horton. Wally-as-Horton snakes out his hands and grabs both 
               Bodyguards by the adam's apple.

                         which we recommend with the house 
                         red for a particularly pleasing taste

               The Bodyguards immediately sit and Lorraine sets pies and 
               wine in front of them.

               circling, circling. The roar is louder than Niagara Falls.

               Woody and Big Tom are dumbfounded, nearly catatonic, glued 
               to their chairs, eyes bugging out of their heads as they 
               stare at the mad spectacle. Randy, standing nearby, completely 
               oblivious to what's transpired, still obsessed by the one 
               detail which plagues him.

                                     RANDY
                         I still smell gas, Big Tom.

               Woody's chair breaks, splinters out from under him and falls 
               away. He remains frozen in a sitting position.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               General-Conrad, Colonel Mofler and the Generals are ensconced 
               in the concrete bunker, all wearing strange goggles. A SOLDIER 
               passes out think copies of the Washington, D.C. phonebook.

                                     COLONEL MOFLER
                              (watching his watch)

                              (etc.)

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Hitch up those phonebooks, boys, no 
                         telling what this sucker'll do to 
                         your procreative recreational system.

               The Soldiers all hold the phonebooks over their crotches. 
               General Conrad already has one taped to the crotch of his 
               cast.

                                     GENERAL CONRAD
                         Check that tape for me, Mofler.

               We see the satellite countdown: 00:00:03 / 00:00:02 / 00:00:01 
               and as it hits 00:00:00 the beeping crescendos and goes SILENT 
               for one brief moment. Then, the satellite produces an 
               emission.; we see a small burst of light shoot from the nozzle 
               and hear a sound like a sharp slam on a ping-pong ball.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HIGH ANGLE, looking down on the United States. The emission, 
               a short piece of light, enters the earth's atmosphere and 
               heads down towards Kansas.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A mile above Newtonville, looking straight down at the center 
               of town. The emission descends down, strikes the center of 
               town and a giant "X" of light forms over the entire city. 
               From the center of the "X", a line of light spirals out like 
               a watch spring. When it reaches the edge of town the entire 
               "X" rotates 90 degrees and stops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the middle of his passionate kiss with Lorraine, Wally-as-
               Horton disappears and it replaced by the Professor-as-Newt-
               now-Horton. He stops kissing Lorraine. We notice that the 
               green pies have turned red and the red wine has turned green. 
               Alice-as-Sammy "the Stomp" is now singing an operatic aria.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT-NOW-HORTON
                         Let me clarify something; am I in 
                         Heaven? Are you an Angel?

                                     LORRAINE
                         See what I mean? These days you say 
                         the sweetest things. And who ever 
                         knew you were such a wonderful cook. 
                         I hope this doesn't frighten you, 
                         but I suddenly find myself filled 
                         with maternal longings.

                                     THE PROFESSOR-AS-NEWT-NOW-HORTON
                         Frighten me? It's the best news I've 
                         had since the discovery of sub-atmoic 
                         particles.

               She looks at him with the slightest touch of curiosity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPANY "A" CANAPE ROOM - DAY

               Carrying his sock, Newt-as-the-Professor moves down a line, 
               shaking the hands of Company "A" employees as he departs. 
               The Trick Dog, Bert, Mel and Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice trail 
               behind him.

               Just as he reaches Delbert Corrigan and Simone, Newt-as-the-
               Professor disappears and Wally-as-Horton-now-the-Professor 
               appears in his place. The Trick Dog is the only one who 
               notices the switch; he growls and bites Wally-as-Horton-now-
               the Professor's ankle. Wally-as-Horton-now-the Professor 
               points a finger and glares bumblebee eyes at him; the Trick 
               Dog leaps up into his arms and licks his face. Delbert 
               Corrigan extends a hand.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                         Professor, it's been an absolute 
                         delight --

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON-NOW-THE-PROFESSOR
                              (with a finger)
                         First of all, that was absolutely 
                         the worst cafeteria food I've ever 
                         tasted in my life.

               Delbert Corrigan shrinks back, shocked. Simone aggressively 
               intercedes.

                                     SIMONE
                         You got a lotta nerve, you fruitcake --

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON-NOW-THE-PROFESSOR
                              (the finger)
                         That's enough.

               She slams on the brakes.

                                     WALLY-AS-HORTON-NOW-THE-PROFESSOR
                         You two ought to spend a little more 
                         time thinking about tenderness. And 
                         cooking.

               Wally-as-Horton-now-the Professor moves along the line, 
               leaving the bewildered Corrigans behind.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                         Perhaps we should try a little 
                         tenderness.

               Sammy "the Stomp"-as-Alice, as if in a trance, sings "Try a 
               Little Tenderness", ala Otis Redding.

                                     SIMONE
                         Delbert, have you ever seen a woman 
                         my age do something like this?

               She leaps up, grabs the pipe of the sprinkler system and 
               does a one-arm chin-up.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                         Definitely a little tenderness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton-as-Wally sits at the dinner table with Polly and 
               Gordie. Horton-as-Wally disappears and Newt-as-the Professor-

               pies are now red and the wine is green.

                         Of course you can, Wally.

               Newt-as-the Professor-now-Wally rises and starts towards the 
               bathroom. Gucci-Gucci leaps into his arms and licks his fact.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWTON MANOR ROCKING HORSE ROOM - DAY

               The Professor-as-Newt vanishes from his place beside the 
               "pig" bomb, where the countdown is at: 00:00:16. Horton-as-
               Wally-now-the Professor appears in his place, near a 
               completely sloshed Tidman.

               The "pig" is emitting an irritation whining noise that rises 
               in pitch and intensity.

                                     TIDMAN
                         Perhaps it shall be a finer place we 
                         go to, leaving behind this veil of 
                         tears --
                              (countdown at:00:00:09)
                         -- where our fortunes rise and fall 
                         on the seas of destiny like a tiny 
                         ship, where an action once set in 
                         motion cannot be reversed -- Mother, 
                         I'll be home soon, in fact...
                              (squints at the 
                              countdown)

                         going anywhere.

               Horton-as-Wally-now-the Professor whips out his .357 Magnum 
               and drills the "Pig" right between the "eyes". The "pig's" 
               jaw drops open and a loud "oink" escapes. The irritating 
               noise cuts out and the countdown stops; the last second 
               stopping halfway to zero.

               Tidman looks over at him, looks at the "pig", looks back at 
               Horton-as-Wally-now-the Professor.

               Woody and Big Tom remain staring at it, catatonically.

               The Army officers remove their goggles and peak out over the 
               top of the bunker. The smoke and dust clear, revealing the 
               seventy Texans and Chinese Acrobats seated on folding chairs, 
               in front of a raised dais, where Mayor Billy Benson addressed 
               them over a p.a. system, with "Hail to the Chief" playing in

               Three army jeeps shoot by in reverse, followed by "Sherlock" 
               Watson in the patrol car and the Company "A" limo, also in 
               reverse. A COW in front of the bunker turns to the Generals 
               and lets out a melodic yodel.

               General Conrad turns to Colonel Mofler.

               Through the smoke we see the tap dancing Heinz 57 bottle, 
               doing complicated time steps down the highway.

               The skaters are gone. The crater where the rink once stood 
               remains. The silence is shattering. Freed from their trance, 
               Big Tom and Woody blink at the emptiness. Big Tom shakes his 
               head, emerging from a deep confusion.

               ash and a pear-shaped smudge on the wall.

               The Generals climb out of the bunker and the dust clears, 
               revealing empty chairs in front of the dais. They move up to 
               close to the cow standing in front of the bunker. It moos.

                         Just goes to prove an old saying of 
                         mine: two wrongs don't make a right. 
                         But three do.

               Sunlight, birds, shady trees. Peace. In the far distance, we 
               see a foursome of GOLFERS on the green of the fifteenth hole 
               of the Newtonville Country Club.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Horton-as-Wally-now-the Professor disappears and Newt, just 
               Newt, takes his place, holding his sock, a piece of green 
               pie and a fork. The room is empty, except for Tidman, slouched 
               in a chair, and Grandad, who turns around in his wheelchair, 
               sees Newt and stops short. They look at each other and smile.

                         have so many things to tell you.

               Tidman tries to clear his head, can't believe what he's 
               seeing.

               One of the GOLFERS, now on the sixteenth tee, hits his drive, 
               a towering smash that we follow up into the air, slicing 
               severely to the right and heading directly for a window on 
               the second floor of the manor.

                         rest of the staff, forever and ever 
                         and --

               The golf ball smashes through the window and hits Newt in 
               the head. His eyes get that starry/funny animal look again. 
               He smiles.

                                     NEWT
                         Rock-'em-sock-'em.

               Grandad turns to Tidman, points at Newt and smiles.

               General Conrad sits enveloped in the top of the giant cheese 
               meteor, sending a slow burn towards the heavens.

               The buildings of Company "A" and Company "B" have merged 
               into one giant green building, with the letters "AB" on top.

               Wally-as-Horton-now-the Professor is at the curb with Bert, 
               Mel, Alice (just Alice) and the Professor's bag. Wally-as-
               Horton-now-the Professor disappears and the Professor, just 
               the Professor appears in his place.

               The limo pulls up, looking brand new, with the insignia "AB" 
               on the door. The three Chefs and the Tap Dancing Heinz 57 
               Bottle climb out. Bob McNabb, behind the wheel, waves to 
               Alice.

               The Professor is just about to get into the limo when we

               Scientists we've seen, from both Companies, come running 
               out, all wearing green jumpsuits.

                                     SCIENTISTS
                              (variously)

                         emergency!... Don't let him get in 
                         that car!... Bert and Mel, bring him 
                         back inside!

                         For goodness sake, he'll miss his 
                         plane.

                         There aren't going to be any planes 
                         if he doesn't get inside fast!

                         It's an inconvenience, but it does 
                         sound urgent.

               They pick him up by the elbows and hustle him back towards 
               the green building. They're followed by the three Chefs and 
               the Tap Dancing Heinz 57 bottle.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                              (sets off a thought)
                         Here's yet another example; time was 
                         going by so slowly and suddenly the 
                         universe seems to curve back in on 
                         itself.

               INT. COMPANY "AB" - DAY

               The Professor is carried into a large room by Bert and Mel, 
               swept along with the Scientists and the rest of the group 
               that was outside. A nervous CROWD is gathered around a huge, 
               green double-headed "pig" bomb. The countdown panel has slid 
               open and the countdown is counting down from: 00:00:27. Beside 
               it is a large chalkboard with a formula written on it:

                                 "II x PIG^2 x C = (BOB)"

               The Scientists crowd around the Professor.

                                     SCIENTISTS
                              (variously, accusing 
                              each other)
                         He pushed the button... no, you pushed 
                         the button... it was an accident... 
                         I didn't mean to do it...

                                     SCIENTIST #1
                         This could be a catastrophe of 
                         unprecedented proportion!

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                              (sniffs the air, them)
                         No, no, you got it all wrong.

               The countdown continues. The Professor sidles over to the 
               blackboard and points to the formula.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                         Let me explain something
                              (pointing to the 
                              formula)
                         "Pi" times "permutations interacting 
                         geometrically", and it goes without 
                         saying arbitrarily --

               The countdown is at: 00:00:12. People are praying, weeping, 
               ducking and covering.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                         -- times the speed of light, which 
                         is very fast I can tell you, equals --
                              (points to the first 
                              "b)
                         -- bomb.

               A huge groan from the crowd.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                         -- however, let me direct your 
                         attention to this little "2", do you 
                         see? This means "Pig" squared and we 
                         can clearly discern, or Lucerne where 
                         my Grandmother's from, that this pig 
                         had two heads. Which brings us back 
                         to "bob" - b - o - b -- bomb or 
                         barbecue.

               The crowd is totally bewildered. The countdown reaches zero. 
               Both mouths of the "pig" heads drop open, we hear two loud 
               "oinks". A panel in the side of the "pig" slides open and a 
               large mass of sticky, brownish-red substance glops out onto 
               the floor. The crowd lets out a collective sigh of relief. 
               An incredibly delicious aroma fills the air.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                         So unless I miss my guess we are 
                         looking at and smelling the best 
                         barbecue sauce in the whole darned 
                         world.

               The three Chefs are the first to step forward, filled with 
               trepidation and envy. They cautiously dip their fingers in 
               the sauce and taste it. The incredibly delicious sauce 
               completely overwhelms them.

                                     CHEF #1
                              (almost in tears)
                         Twenty years we at Heinz have been 
                         searching for a sauce like this.

                         Manna from heaven.

               The crowd presses forward to taste the sauce, which quickly 
               degenerates into a spectacle not unlike a frenzied pack of 
               piranha feeding on a bloated zebra.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               thought, whistles, grabs a handful of empty air and snaps 
               his fingers.

                              (he whistles)
                         Time.

                                     MR. BIGG'S VOICE
                         Just one minute!

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN
                         I say, hold on!

               They stop. Mr. Biggs, Delbert Corrigan and Simone rush out 
               of the building to them. Biggs and Corrigan wear green suits, 
               Simone wears some green, high-fashion weirdness.

                                     DELBERT CORRIGAN

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                              (looks them up and 
                              down)
                         How do you do.
                              (he shakes their hands)
                         My name is Professor Hugo 
                         Zinzermacher. Hugo your way, und 
                         I'll go mine.

               The Professor gets into the limo, turns back to Mel and Bert 
               and gives them a big smile.

                                     THE PROFESSOR
                              (sings)
                         It's beginning to look a lot like 
                         Christmas/ Everywhere I go...
                              (and so on)

               The limo drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPUTER PANEL - DAY

               EXTREME CLOSEUP on the saliva bubble, caught between the 
               copper wires. It pops. Music in. Bing Crosby's version of 
               "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HEINZ 57 PLANT - DAY

               Music continues over. The Texans and the Chinese acrobats, 
               working together, make the last adjustments on the sign above 
               the plant, as they install a huge "8" next to the "5" and 
               slowly lower the "7" to the ground. The sign now reads:

                                        "HEINZ 58"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLY NEWTON'S HOUSE - DAY

               Music continues over. A moving van is parked in the driveway 
               of the house next door. MOVERS are carrying boxes and 
               furniture into the house. KIDS on pogo sticks bounce up and 
               down the street.

               Wally, a visibly pregnant Polly and Gordie come out of their 
               house with a sack of green pie take-out from Vinnie's and 
               move to the fence between the houses, where they shake hands 
               with their new neighbors, Horton Thursby and a visibly 
               pregnant Lorraine. Polly gives Lorraine the take-out food.

               ROLL CREDITS

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WALLY AND HORTON'S HOUSES - DAY

               Music continues over. Wally and Horton are both mowing their 
               lawns Gordie bounces around on his pogo stick, packing two 
               six shooters. A horn honks, they all look up and wave, as a 
               massive, convertible Isotta Fraschini touring car drives by, 
               Tidman at the wheel, Newt and Grandad in the rear. They wave. 
               Newt honks his rubber horn as the car moves out of sight.

               Polly and Lorraine, chatting over the fence, both carrying 
               their new born INFANTS, wave to the passing car. As the car 
               moves on, Polly and Lorraine return to their conversation, 
               fussing over the babies.

               The Infants are dead ringers for Wally and Horton.

               FADE TO BLACK

                                         THE END
