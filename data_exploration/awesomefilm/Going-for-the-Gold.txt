CINDY Check that out.

GIRL I Never seen him before.

CINDY He sure is cute.

BILL You girls need a lift somewhere?

GIRL 1 Not with you, bucko.

BILL I wasn't talking to you.

CINDY Well I do need to be getting home soon.

BILL Come on in.

CINDY Hi.

BILL, Hi.  What's your name?

CINDY Cindy.  What's yours?

BILL Bill.

CINDY Where're you from?

BILL Sandy.  It's just a little south of here.

CINDY I know where it is.  We play you guys in
 football.

BILL Sure you do.

CINDY I like your car.

BILL Thanks, I just got it.

CINDY How come there's no key?

BILL Well, that's er, a new feature.

CINDY Hey, neat.

POLICEMAN I Didn't we just get a report on a stolen Camaro?

POLICEMAN 2 Let's check it out.

BILL I think you'd better put your seat belt on.

CINDY Watch out.
 I don't see them.  They've disappeared.
 Do you hear me.  They're not behind us anymore

BILL This baby really purrs, doesn't it?

CRAIG You could give me a hand.

BILL, Yeh I could.  But I'd just get in the way.

CRAIG So what took you so long?


BILL I had to make a pit stop.

CRAIG Well, I know that.  What was her name?

BILL You know I can't remember.
 You sure we're going to make more money selling
 this for parts?

CRAIG Haven't we always.

BILL Yeh, I guess.
 I just need some money right now, for some
 new skis,

CRAIG You just bought a new pair.

BILL I know, but I trashed them out last month.

 Look, I'm trying to get some sleep.  Could
 you keep it down.

CRAIG Well why don't you go home.

BILL And have my old man yell at me?
 Forget it.  Call me if you need me.

CRAIG Thanks a lot.

WALLY Where the hell you been?
 Where'd you get that money, huh?
 Don't I give you enough?

BILL I worked for it.

WALLY Huh....
 So what did you steal, this time?

BILL Oh come on dad.  Leave me alone.  I'm tired, o-kay?

WALLY Bill, you've got to stop doing this.
 They catch you again, you're going to do time.
%
 I'm talking to you.

BILL What?

WALLY You don't mend your ways, you're never going
 to amount to nothing.

BILL Oh look who's talking, you don't even
 care any more

WALLY Don't give me any sass.  I've been supporting
 you your whole life.

BILL So what!
 I'm leaving.
 Come on you guys.
 A lot tougher than hot wiring cars,

CRAIG Yeh, and not as much money in it either.

BILL Why are we doing it?

CRAIG Beacause we couldn't find a car.


BILL There'd better be beer in this thing.

CRAIG Yeh, yeh, go open the back of the van.
'T
POLICEMAN Freeze.  Get those two.
 Hands against the car.  Come on, spread out.
 Spread out.
 Just for one minute.

POLICEMAN 2 Those other two kids got away.

SERGEANT Quite a little collection you've got here,
 Johnson, William Dean.  Unauthorized use of
 a vehicle.....Possession of stolen property...
 Possession of a controlled substance.....
 Burglary.....Pretty impressive for a juvenile,
 Johnson.  You got one phone call.  Make it
 quick.
BILL I don't have any one to call.

SERGEANT Law says you got one call.  I'd make it if I
 were you.

BILL Well you're not me.

SERGEANT 0-kay.  I'll show you to your new home.

JUDGE William Dean Johnson, the disposition of the
 Court is that you are sentenced to one year
 in the county jail, and you will serve at
 least one hundred and eighty days of that
 sentence.  Upon completion of said sentence
 you will be under the probation of the
 Oregon Community Corrections Division for
 a period of two years.
 Court's adjourned.
/1/4
WALLY Your honor, um, I maybe out of line, but
 could I speak to you for a minute please.

JUDGE Who are you?

WALLY I'm Bill's father.  Not a very good one,
 particularly, but, his father.

JUDGE What is it, Mister Johnson?

WALLY Well I would, I would just like to tell the
 Court that, well, Bill has, has gone through
 some really hard times recently - since his
 mother and I were divorced, and, and the
 family split up.  Well I've, I've got this
 at, this letter here.  You see, Bill has been
 accepted by college, on a ski programme.
-% And I, I would just hate to see him lose
 this opportunity if he has to do time.  I, I'm
 not saying huh, of course, that he doesn't
 deserve sentencing.  I'm just asking the
 Court if it would reconsider, er, put him on
 probation, at, something.  Just give him
 another chance, because he is really a good
 boy.  Your honor, really.

JUDGE Mister Johnson, your son has broken the law.
 More than once.

WALLY I know, I know, your honor.  I know, believe
 me.  But he's never used a gun.  And he's
(tm) never hurt any one.  You give him this chance
 and I promise you, he won't get in trouble
 again, ever.  

JUDGE Is your father right, Bill?

BILL Yes, sir.

JUDGE I think he is to.  Alright, I'm suspending
 sentence and putting you on probation, the
 stipulation that you attend this college.
 However, if you cause any trouble, or so
 much as spit on the sidewalk, I'll slap
 you back into court faster than you can
 put on your skis.

WALLY Thank you, your honor, thank you.

BILL These people are serious.
- This is more like it.
 Hey, guys, I'm Johnson.
 Bill Johnson.
 Your fours aren't going to beat his sixes.

ANDY Thanks a lot, guy.

PETERSON What are you, some kind of clown?

BILL No, I'm Bill Johnson.  I didn't catch your name.

PETERSON Well you'll know soon enough, But it's Scott
 Peterson.

BILL Hi, Scott.  You a skier too?

PETERSON I'm not just a skier, Johnson.  I'm the best.

BILL That can't be.

PETERSON Why not?

BILL Because I am.

PETERSON Hee hey, listen to the big shot here.
 I guess the only way to prove you wrong, is
  to rub your nose in my tracks.

BILL Oh gee, Scott, thanks.  I'll be looking forward
 to it.

PETERSON Let's get out of here.

BILL Good bye.  See you guys later.

STUDENT off Hey, Scott.  Wait up

BILL Why aren't you leaving?

ANDY I live here.  I'm your room mate.


BILL Well, Hi.  we'd better shake hands right here.
 I'm Bill Johnson.

ANDY I'm Andy Perlmutter.

FAULSTICH And I'm Eric Faulstich.  Your coach.

BILL Hi, I'm Bill Johnson.

FAULSTICH Yes, I know.  Why don't you hop down to the

 #3/4 pro board's office, sign in and make out
 your schedule.  Ski practice will be posted
 on the board in the hall of the students
 union.  We'll begin later on in the week after
 everybody gets a chance to sort out the classes.
 Oh, oh, yes.  I've arranged for you to get free
 meals.

BILL You have?

FAULSTICH You'll be working as a bus boy in the cafeteria.

BILL Bus boy in the cafeteria?

MAGGIE Yes?  You want something?

BILL Can I take your plate?

MAGGIE No, I'm not through yet.

BILL Well I'll wait.
1	

MAGGIE I didn't know that they had waiters here.

BILL Oh, they don't.  I'm a rarity.

MAGGIE Um, I'm Maggie Wright.  Who are you?
BILL I'm your new boyfriend.

MAGGIE Alright Johnson, let's move it.

BILL Wh, where are we going?

MAGGIE Where does it look like we're going?
 Look three days ago you notified everybody
 that you were my boyfriend.  So guess what?
 I want a date.

BILL Well that can be arranged.

MAGGIE No, that's already been taken care of.  So put
 your boots on, and let's find out how good
B you really are.
 Move it.

BILL You believe her?

ANDY Yeh I do.

BILL Real cute.  Very cute.  You're not meant to do
 that.

MAGGIE No kidding.  It's your luck.


BILL Good luck, huh?
 What's next, coach?

FAULSTICH Just wait here for the rest of the team,
 Johnson.

BILL They could take forever.

FAULSTICH The drill's for style not for speed.

BILL Style's fine.  What I want to do is go faster.

FAULSTICH Sometimes you have to learn to crawl before
 you can walk.

BILL I can crawl just fine.  What I want to do is fly.
	a
FAULSTICH It seems that there are certain people here who
 don't understand the purpose of our practice
 session.  So for the benifit of those people, we're
 going to spend some time reviewing basic
 fundamentals in principles of style.  Now I'm sure
 we all remember the first and most important
 thing the skier learns is conditioning.  So
 remembering how important our skiers legs are,
 take off your skis and follow me.

PETERSON It's great, huh?

ANDY Man my feel are tired.  I don't think I'll be
j# able to walk tomorrow let alone ski.  Oh, now
 the cafeteria's closed.

PETERSON Hm, when you're a hot dog like Johnson here.  Who
 needs to eat.
 Right, hot dog?

BILL God, I'm sick of you.  You keep telling me
 you're the best.  Why don't you prove it.

PETERSON Any time.

BILL Now.
 You comin'?
 Any time you're ready.

PETERSON Let's go.
 Go ahead, kill yourself.

FAULSTICH Of all the dumb, stupid, asinine things to do!
 You want to wipe yourself out?  Don't do it on
 my slopes.  It's not enough you have to waste
 ... our time with your hot dog routine during
 practice.  You have to try to wipe the team out
 at night.  This is a team sport!  Either you're
 a member of the team, or you're gone.

BILL This is a team sport, how come only one person
 wins coach?

FAULSTICH You're out of here.

BILL Your loss.


MAGGIE Can I take you plates?

BILL Yeh, I'm through

MAGGIE Are you?

BILL I got kicked off the team.

MAGGIE I know, I just heard.  I also heard you were
 quitting school.
BILL Well,
 I don't have much reason to stay around here,
  A do I?

MAGGIE Really?  I thought this was the big chance you
 wanted.  The opportunity to make something of
 yourself.

BILL, Look I've been doing these stupid little hill
 drills since third grade.  I mean I came here
 to learn and improve, go faster.

MAGGIE Have you talked to coach, Falstich.
 Have you told him how important this really is
 to you?

BILL He knows.

MAGGIE Does he?

BILL Coach.

FAULSTICH How did you get up here?

BILL I walked up.

FAULSTICH You what?

BILL I walked up.  Look I'd like to ski down with
(r)$5 the team.
 I'm sorry about what I did, it wont happen
 again.  Look I just want to ski and train.

FAULSTICH Take am down, Scotty.

BILL Coach, I need your help.

FAULSTICH You got it.

BILL Alright.  Thanks.

FAULSTICH You know what I want.

BILL Yeh, team work.
 Come in.
 Hi.

MAGGIE What are you doing?
 Are you going home for Christmas?

BILL No,

MAGGIE Well then, where are you going?


BILL Aspen.

MAGGIE When did this happen?

BILL Today.  Paul Mudder knows somebody who knows
%1/2& somebody who got me a job working on the
 mountain.

MAGGIE Hm, well, I guess it's better than washing
 dishes, huh?

BILL Yeh, it sure is.  The best part is the U.S. Ski
 Team is going to be there.  So I might get to
 ski with them.

MAGGIE Mm.  Well this is going to make your Christmas
 present a little awkward.  You see, I thought
 that you were going to be here all alone so
 I got you another girl.

BILL You what?

MAGGIE Yeh, I know, I guess you could take her with
 you.  Um.....

BILL Maggie, what are you talking about?
8s
MAGGIE Look, her name is Sophie and she's very young,
 alright?  So you have to be gentle.

BILL Sophie!

MAGGIE Yeh......

BILL Ohhh...  Sophie.
 Isn't she beautiful

MAGGIE I know...  Do you like her?

BILL Yeh, I do.  Thank you.

MAGGIE Your welcome

BILL What a big surprise.

 Aspen, Colorado.

BILL Hold it in your hand, Don't sit down.  Have a
 good day.
 Take care.
 Are you staying here?

GIRL Yeh.

BILL That's good.  Hold the pole in one hand, and don't
 sit down.
D Have a good day.

GIRL Thanks.


BILL Right.
 There you go.  Put your poles in one hand.
 Don't sit down.  Right through your legs.
 There you go.
 What a girl.
 0-kay.  Nice one.
 Alright now.  Come on, put those skis around.
 Right.  Put your skis around here.  Alright.  Not
 a good place to fall, is it?

PAM No.

BILL No.  O-kay.  Stand up.

PAM 0-kay.

BILL Good one.  Oh no ...  you ...
 I think you should take lessons.
 You're not doing well here.
 0-kay?  Give me your hand.

PAM 0-kay.

BILL Get those skis around.

PAM Sorry.

BILL Alright.  Good you're standing.

PAM Yes.

BILL Good.  Do you want to go dancing?

PAM 0-kay

BILL 0-kay.  My name's Bill.

PAM. I'm Pam.

BILL Hi, Pam.  Let's go, Pam.

PAM Alright.

BILL Oh.  Pam, what are you doing here?
 You shouldn't be on this slope.

SKI BUM STINE Huh, what a way to spend the winter nights.
 All the women and powder anybody could want.

KELLY Women and powder don't mix.
 Not if your serious about your skiing.
	K
BILL Ski team arrived yet?

KELLY Yeh, they checked in this afternoon.

BILL Can't wait to see what they can do.

KELLY Lots.

SKI BUM STINE At the best make us look like we ski in
 snow shoes.

BILL Sure.

KELLY Come on, Johnson they're the best in the U.S.
 They're going to be in the Olympics.

BILL What makes them so special?

SKI BUM STINE Talent.  Something we haven't got.

BILL Speak for yourself.
 Excuse me.  Aren't you Buddy Gilmore?

BUDDY Was, yes.

BILL Hi, Bill Johnson.

BUDDY Hi, Bill.
Pk
BILL Tell me something.  What does it take to make
 the Olympic Team?

BUDDY Now come on, kid.  Leave me alone, huh?

BILL No, man.  I'm serious.  You were the best.
 What does it take?

BUDDY Style.

BILL Style?  What are you talking about?

BUDDY Just look around, kid.  It takes style.
 Here, and on the down hill.  It's what it's all
 about.

BILL Hi.  Who are you?

KIMBERLEY Why?

BILL Are you on the ski team?

KIMBERLEY Good guess.

BILL What do you run?

KIMBERLEY Where ever I can.

BILL I'm downhill.
@1/4S
KIMBERLEY You look it.  Excuse me.

STEWARD Ladies and gentlemen.  May I have your
 attention, please.
 For those of you who don't know I'm Bob
 Steward.  Alpine Director of the United States
 Ski Team,
 On behalf of the team thank you and welcome.
 Never before has our country had the good fortune
 to compile such an outstanding group of athletes
 to represent us.
 These young men and women, have trained and
 dedicated themselves to bring home the gold.
 And now it is pleasure to present to you the coach
 of the United States Ski Team, Johnny Lider.


̿)['LIDER I just want to say that gathered in this
 room are the finest group of athletes I've
 ever been associated with.  United States
 skiing has taken a back seat too long!  Our
 goal is to realize the dream of these young
 men and women.  But that's going to take a
 lot funding.  So on behalf of the team and
 myself, I want to thank you all for your
 support.  Thank you.

BILL Excuse me, excuse me.  Buddy.  Hey, think you
 could introduce me?

BUDDY Yeh, yeh, this is er, Sonia.  What's your
 last name?

SONIA Smith.

BUDDY Smith.

BILL No, hi, no, I, I meant Coach Lider.

BUDDY Hey, just relax, kid.  This is a party.
 Come on.

BILL Maybe I could meet him later, huh?

SONIA Buddy, come on.

BUDDY Hey, take it easy.  Let it happen, kid.
 Right, Sonia?

SONIA 0-kay.

BUDDY 0-kay.

KELLY He's really smoking.
 Stoner's really good, man.

BILL He's lucky.

SKI BUM STINE Oh what are you talking about?

BILL He almost lost it on those last bumps.
0\
KELLY What are you, some kind of an authority or
 something, Johnson?

BILL No, but I know he almost lost it on those last
 bumps.
 They looked good.  They're just not great.
 I mean for Olympic Skiers I expected a lot
 better.

KELLY You're crazy, Johnson.  All those days on the
 Bunny hill have affected your brain.

GIRL His brain was affected long before the
 Bunny hill.

BILL I'm not going to be here much longer anyway.
 A few weeks longer and I'll have enough money
 to go east.

SKI BUM STINE Where you going to get a job, in lodge?
%d(

BILL No, I don't want to teach skiing.  I want to
 do it.

SKI SUM STINE Where?

BILL Vermont.

SKI BUM STINE You're kidding.

PAM You know how cold it gets in Vermont?

BILL I'll find a way to keep warm.
 This rounds on you, Stine.

SKI BUM STINE Yeh?  Oh well.

ALL Cheers.

BILL Hi, dad.  I'm on the road, slowly making my
 way east.  Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing
 to do, to leave school.  But it's the only way
 I can find out how good I am.  I think that
 nice old guy, the judge, would agree don't
5g you?
 My skiing's improved a lot, but I'm still
 not aggressive enough to be a top down hill
 racer.  You always told me life was a gamble,
 go ahead and throw the dice -well that's
 what I'm doing.  One way or another at least
 I'll know so I wont be sitting around in
 front of a T.V. wondering what I might have
 been if I had the guts to try, Coach
 Faulstich had a poem on his wall that I
 keep remembering - 'I'm a little hurt, but
 not slain.  Lay me down to bleed awhile,
 then I'll arise to fight again.'
,Hk Dad, the fight's just begun for me.
 Your son, Bill.

BILL Excuse me?

REP Yeh?

BILL Hi, I'm, I'm Bill Johnson.

REP Hi.

BILL Hi.

REP Hey, aren't you the kid who tried to kill
 himself yesterday?

BILL Yeh, what's left of him.
 I'm looking for a sponser.

REP I'll bet.

BILL So, what do I have to do to get Friedmeyer's
 to sponser me?

REP Win.

BILL Well listen, I had the fastest qualifying
 time going until I caught an edge.  I could
 have won if I'd been on Friedmyers.

RE" Maybe.

BILL So, why don't you let me try a pair next
tl week at Lake Placid, huh?

REP I'd like to but I can't give them out to
 just anybody

BILL Look, I'm not just any ski bum, O-Kay?
 I can win for you.  What about a pair of
 demos?

REP Sorry, kid.  Can't do it.

MAN Which ones do you like, darling?

GIRL Er, I think the blue ones.

MAN Why not.

BILL How much are these long GS's

PRO They're on sale for three twenty five.

BILL Could I pay you a little bit at a time?

PRO Sure, and when you've paid them off, the
Yt skis are yours.

BILL How about if I work in your shop.  Do you
 need some help?

PRO No, we're all staffed for the season.

BILL Thanks anyway.

JIM Bill, Jim Myers, we haven't met.

BILL How ya doing?

JIM Can I talk to you for a bit?

BILL Sure.

JIM I've been watching you.  What kind of skis
 you using?

BILL Er, just some old, warped two by fours I've
 had for years.

JIM Have you ever tried Atomics?

BILL No.  Who makes them?

JIM We do, in Austria.
 We're an old company, just starting up out here.
 We're looking for young aggressive skiers such as
 yourself.  To represent us.

BILL Did you see me eat it yesterday?

JIM Yeh.  Everyone else was slowing down at that
 corner.  Had you been on a set of these, I
 think you would have stayed on your feet and
 won.  How about giving them a try next week end?

BILL Yeh.  Sure, What the hell.

ANNOUNCER Number nineteen, Bill Johnson is the winner
 today.  With the time, one forty five point
 eighteen.

CROWDS Cheers.

KIMBERLEY Hi, remember me?
Yx\
BILL Oh, I've been trying to forget you, but I
 find I can't.  Your face has been haunting
 my dreams.

KIMBERLEY Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm Kimberley Brown.

BILL Hi, I'm Bill Johnson.

KIMBERLEY Yeh, I know who you are.  Now let's find out
 what you are.  I'm from Ski World Magazine,
 Got a minute?

BILL Sure, when?

KIMBERLEY Now.  Start talking.  You're from the North
 West, right?

BILL That's right.  Sandy, Oregon, It's about
 fifty miles north west of the nearest-
 McDonalds.

KIMBERLEY How did you learn to ski?
vx"
BILL Well actually I was raised by penguins,
 who taught me the fundamentals of balance,
 which is the key to downhill racing.

KIMBERLEY You know, you caused quite an upset here
 today, Johnson.  One of your first Eastern
 races and you win, against some tough
 competition.  What do you think of the
 course?

BILL It was easy.  I've been hearing about these
 Eastern courses being so tough, it's like a
 bunny hill from where I come from.
 What are you doing tonight?

KIMBERLEY Nothing, with you.
 |}	
BILL It's too bad.  Because I've got a big condo
 overlooking the mountain.  Gonna have a big
 party, Everybody's going to be there.
 Just have to celebrate without you, huh?
 Old Bill Johnson had a party and no one came.
 Except for you, Sophie.
 I'm glad you came.
 'Course you're the only one I invited.
 Except for Kimberley.  You'd like Kimberley.
 She's nice, and she's pretty.  And she's classie,
 really classie.  Of course you're pretty classie.
 Aren't you?  Except you're a dog.
 A classic dog, I like that.  Yeh.


לMARAULT Gentlemen, it's getting late and we still have
 a few more to go.  So if we can bear with us er,
 we can all get to the bar.  What about this,
 Johnson kid?

COACH He's good, but he hardly fits the image of the
 U.S. Ski Team.

MARAULT No matter what he's done in the past, the fact
 is, the kid can ski.  I thought that's what
 we were looking for.

COACH 1 Be impossible to coach.  Chip on his shoulder.
 And no respect for authority.

MARAULT We got the best coach.....

COACH I We don't need any trouble makers.

MARAULT Alright.  What's next?

LIDER What's next is another poor showing at the
 Olympics if your not willing to take some
 chances.  Look, who knows, this could just
 be the kid to bring us our first gold medal.
SANDERS Well I've never seen this Johnson boy, but it
 seems pretty stupid to me, to be accepting kids
 into camp that he's already beaten.

LIDER I agree.

SANDERS Now personally I don't care where he's from
 or what he's done.  The boy's a skier and
"ۋ that's what this team desperately needs.
 So I say that we bring him into camp and
 see what he does.  He's earned that chance.

MARAULT Alright, who's in favour?
 That's it.

LIDER Johnson's in.

COACH Two, three, go.  
 One, two three, go.

LIDER He's now broken the course record for a third
 straight day.  The kid's got talent.

SANDERS Right.  Let's see if we can get through to him.

LIDER Johnson, let's see you at the office, alright?
 Come on in, Bill.
 Sit down.

BILL Hello.

SANDERS Have you got a problem, Johnson?
-ݭd
BILL No, not that I know of.

SANDERS Well, you don't strike me as being shy, but I
 don't see you participating.

BILL In what?


SANDERS Our exercise programme.

LIDER Morning Kellasynics for example

SANDERS I haven't seen you jogging or lapping the
 pool.

LIDER So far you have avoided any and all social
 activities.
BILL I ski don't I?  That's what I came here to do.
 Not play and socialise.

LIDER What's bothering you, Bill?

BILL Look, I don't fit in with these guys.

SANDERS What the hell are you talking about?
 
BILL Come on.  They're into their cars and their
 clothes.  They've all got money.

LIDER That's not true.

BILL Well they sure act like it.

LIDER Bill you're here because you have the
 potential and the ability to represent the
 United States.  That's the only reason anyone's
 here.
 Now if you want to make this team, then damn it,
 you've got to show us.

SANDERS It's your decision, son.  It's all up to you.

COACH Stop.  Up.  Stop.

BOY You're smart.

LIDER It was a tough decision guys.  Olympic Team's
- posted on the board.

BOYS Cheer.

BILL Dad?
 You o-kay?

WALLY Yeh, yeh, yeh.

BILL Want me to get you a wheel chair?

WALLY Just get me a cigarette.
 Oh I forgot you don't smoke anymore.
 Just leave me here to die.

BILL Oh, no dad, I don't want to litter.
 Come on.
 So, dad, I don't know what I'm going to do
 with Sophie when I go to Europe.

WALLY Well I'll take care of her.  O-Kay?

BILL Well.  Sophie, Sophie, want a new room mate?
 Well?  I guess so.


BILL You know they say Europe's beautiful.  I can't
 imagine any other place being more beautiful
 than this.

WALLY Son, you're going to see some of the most beautiful
 places in the world.  You're going to go to countries
 that - most people only dream of.
 France, Switzerland, Austria.  I've never been to any
 of those pieces..
 You knew, Bill, well, how do I say it?  I'm just so
 proud of you.  Really, the way you put your life
 together to where it is now..

BILL You haven't even begun to proud of me, Dad.

WALLY You know, we might have had some harsh words, er,

 harsh words.
 And maybe I, I was a little tough on you at times, but,
 and I don't mean this as a cock out but I was doing it
 for you.  Because, you know if you don't learn early on
 that life is er, it's mean and it's tough, it can wipe
 you out, I just wanted you to know that you have to
 fight for what you get.  Nobody gives it to you.  I just
 want you to be the best you can be.
 Bring it home, son.

BILL I'm going to try, dad.  I'm going to try.

CRAIG Headers, highrise manifold, high lift cam, beefed up
 rear end.  four eleven geers.  That sucker can fly.

BILL Maybe even faster than me, huh?

CRAIG Loiuse.

BILL I hear that the mill might be shutting down.

BILL Yeh, when you win.

CRAIG Yeh, any girls?

BILL Sure, you know, the groupies, stuff.

GRAIG You'll be on T.V.

LIDER Alright you guys, listen now, here's your starting
n positions for the downhill.
 Stoner, Four.  Stockton, eighteen.  Ralston, twenty
 five.  Bryant, thirty seven.  Reardon, forty three.
 Montana, forty four.  Johnson, eighty two.

BILL Eighty two?

LIDER You boys have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.  Make
 sure you get plenty of rest tonight.

BILL Say, Montana, isn't that him?

MONTANA Yeh, they call him The Cszar.

BILL What, haven't they ever seen a skier before?

MONTANA We're skiers.  He's a national hero.

LIDER How ya feeling?

BILL I'll recover.

LIDER Two beers.

BILL There's nothing up there but ice and rocks.

LIDER I know.

BILL Probably a good course when there's snow on it.

LIDER You have to start somewhere.

BILL Well I'm not starting in the back again.  It's suicide.

LIDER It's not up to you.

BILL Where did Stoner finish?

LIDER What difference does that make.


BILL Where did he come in?

LIDER Eighteenth.

BILL Well, what did he do, walk down?  He starts fourth and
 finishes eighteenth.  That's a hell of a run.
d
LIDER He was seeded, Johnson.  He earned that start.

BILL Like I earned eighty second.

LIDER Gives you something to shoot for, doesn't it?
BILL If I would have started fourth, I could have given
 The Cszar a run for his money.

LIDER Maybe.
 Then again, maybe not.

BILL Hey, Kimberley.

KIMBERLEY Hey, killer.
 Took your lumps today I hear.

BILL And end some. Did you see it?

KIMBERLEY You serious?  I made for the bar after the first fifteen.
 Let see, you were number.....?

BILL Eighty two.

KIMBERLEY My God, you must have been skiing down on dirt.

BILL And rocks.

KIMBERLEY Were you alright?
 No broken bones?

BILL No, just my ego.

 number eighty one.

BILL Thanks a lot.

ANNOUNCER .......of one fifty six point twenty two.

BILL Tenth of a second.  How can I get a tenth of a second
 faster?
-I\
MONTANA Cheat.
KIMBERLEY Or get a new pair of skis.
 Hi yer, Killer.
 You know you can't do much on a tenth of a second.

BILL I could win.
 Tom Montana, Kimberley Brown.

KIMBERLEY Yeh, I've heard about you.

MONTANA You should.  You interviewed me last month for the
 magazine you work for.

KIMBERLEY Oh boy!  Well that show you what a room my head is.

MONTANA Really made an impression.

KIMBERLEY I'm sorry.  Will you forgive me, please?

MONTANA It's not necessary.  See you.

BILL I can't believe you didn't remember him.  What are
	v you, a phony?  You're no reporter.

KIMBERLEY It's a cover up.

BILL For what?

KIMBERLEY I'm writing a novel.

BILL About skiing?

KIMBERLEY Skiers.

BILL Am I in it?

KIMBERLEY Well not yet.  I have to research you first.

BILL Oh, let's get started.

KIMBERLEY What right here in the middle of the square?

BILL No, we can go inside.

KIMBERLEY Oh.
 You know I've been meaning to get together with you
 for quite a while.  I've been watching your progress
 on the circuit.  You've really come a long.
#{
BILL Thanks.
KIMBERLEY Tell me, what kind of skis do you use?

BILL You researching me?

KIMBERLEY No.  It's just an enquiry from a concerned admirer

BILL Atomics.

KIMBERLEY Do you have a good contract with them?

BILL It's the best I can get.

KIMBERLEY Have you ever tried Friedmyers?

BILL No.


KIMBERLEY Oh, they're the best.  You should try them some time.
 A lot of the top racers use them.  It could make a
 difference.

BILL A tenth of a second difference?

KIMBERLEY I'm sure they would.
 Now you're being researched.
"
BILL 0-kay.

KIMBERLEY We're here.
 Do you want to make love here or in my chalet?

BILL I mean for a guy who lives in a van it doesn't make
 much difference.

KIMBERLEY Well it does to me.  In side, Killer.

BILL You don't really own this place do you?

KIMBERLEY No I borrow it, from friends.

BILL Nice friends.

KIMBERLEY Hm mm.

BILL Think you'll be here for Christmas?

KIMBERLEY Mm mm.  St. Moritz.  But, I can give you a call as
 soon as I get back.  0-kay?
 Ciao.
JIM Hey, Bill Johnson.  It's Jim Myers.  Come on I want
U to show you something.  Come on.
 So what do you think of our factory?

BILL Really impressive.  How many people work here?

JIM We've got fifty two.  Putting out seventy five thousand
 pairs of skis a year.

BILL Somewhere in this factory I've got to find a tenth of a
 second if I'm going to beat The Cszar.

JIM I don't think you're going to find it in the skis,
 Bill.  But take a look at these.  We're scheduled to
 go into production on them next year.
 You got er, laminated wood, fibre glass and aluminum.
u Thirty six hard-crafted parts.  They're easier to ski
 than assemble.  And these were made especially for you.
 What do you think?

BILL I think you did a hell of a job, Jim.  I also think
 we have to find that tenth of a second in the wind
 tunnel.
 Well, how did we do?

JIM I think we're onto something, buddy.
 We can tell by the dab here if you can just stay in
 that tuck long enough you can pick up some valuable
 time .

BILL Well, I guess I'll just have to get in that tuck quicker
 and stay in it longer, huh?
`
JIM It's a lot easier in a wind tunnel than flying
 down a mountain at eighty miles an hour.

BILL Oh well, you did your part, Jim.  Now it's up to me.

 Wengen, Switzerland


MUSBURGER off All week long this small Swiss village has been
 buzzing with excitement in preparation for the
 fifty fourth running of the Wengen Downhill, the
 longest and most dangerous run in the world.
 And now it's up to the starting gate with John
 Tesh and Billy Kidd.

BILLY off From Austria this is Erwin Resch.....
 He's coming into long jump, and the area of this

Z3 long jump is going to be a very difficult spot on
 this course, John.

JOHN off Almost out of control again, Erwin Resch.  And now he
 is number one.  In the Intermediate Time: one, forty
 eight, seventy three.  That's the best time downhill
 this far.

BILLY off This section of Austrian Hole was named because thirty
 years ago nine out of twelve Austrians fell down in
 there.  It's a very difficult section.  The final turn.
 Resch leans over a little bit.

JOHN off ..........Thirteen thirty eight, the time to beat.

u3 He can take first place if he takes it here.  Two,
 eleven, 0 six.  Yes, Erwin Resch from Austria.
 In first place.
 So the rivalry continues here.  Taking two Austrians
 up top.  But many more skiers to come.

 ERWIN RESCH AUT

 LEADER

 BILL JOHNSON
 UNITED STATES

BILLY off Now out of start house, this is twenty three year old
 Bill Johnson.  Before this week no one really knew who
 he was.  But then on Friday, he turned in the best time
 at a training run.  Last year he won the Europa Cup.
	yP` Considered the Junior World Cup.  He's been racing for
 sixteen years, and two years ago he showed up for ski team
 practice and the coaches said he was out of shape.
 So they sent him back to dry land training.  But he's
 come back strong.

JOHN off They want to keep him on the team now because he is
 really a fast skier.  He has the fastest run at
 training very often.  But very often he's too fast,
 he can't keep together all the way.

BILLY off Last year on Aspen Mountain in Colorado, he took a
P- high speed fall in America's Down-hill he sustained
 a severe concussion.  He's very agressive, And
 sometimes skis out of control.
 Waiting for that seconds, the seconds, what time, the
 fastest so far, but, Johnson is losing it, no, faster
 I fear, he's off the course, he's on the course again.
 Johnson's all over this hill.  Only about eight hundred
 metres left and he's still on the Course.  I don't
 believe it.  He pushes right to the absoluted limit,
 here's the last turn, the last jump.  Time's two eleven
(tm)P 0 six, that's very prescious time. can he do it?  
Johnson is close.  Billy Johnson, fastest
 so far.  An American now in the lead,......

 BILL JOHNSON U.S.A.

 LEADER

WALLY Hooray.  We won, Sophie, huh?  Hooray!

BILLY over ........I thought he was totally out of the race there
 for a moment.

JOHN off Johnson is one of the best fliers in the world, he tries
 to keep his skis right on the snow.  But it's dangerous
 at seventy miles an hour you can catch an edge, like
3...P he does right here.  Watch his left ski, the edge catches,
 the skis split apart.  He pulls them back together, they
 split again, he pulls them back together once more right
 here, and that ski knocks the other ski out.  I can't
 believe that he pulled that ski back.  He's on one ski now,
 he falls over backwards and he barely pulls himself up.
 He goes through the air off the course, gets back on the
 course again.  What a run.

LIDER Hold it, hold, hold, hold it, slow down, we'll get to all
 your questions, alright?  Just one at a time.
X^
GIRL Tell me, Bill, what was going through your mind?
BILL Winning.  Right coach?

LIDER Bill is a fighter.  A street-smart competitor.  He has
 the potential to be one of the most gifted atheletes
 I've ever coached.  Now we served notice today that
 this is just the beginning.  The United States Ski
 Team is a power to be reckoned with in all future
 Alpine events.

REPORTER Bill, what are your chances in the Olympics coming up?

BILL Chance has nothing to do with it.  I'm going to win.

,_LIDER I, I think what Bill mans to say is, that he........

BILL I'm going to win it.  There isn't a skier who can beat
 me.  Not anybody.  They'll all be skiing for second place.

FRIEDMEYER Bill, so glad you could come.

BILL Mister Friedmeyer....

FRIEDMEYER Come in, please.  I believe you know Kimberley?

KIMBERLEY Bill, how nice to see you again.

BILL Nice to see you to.

FRIEDMEYER Something to drink?

BILL Yeh.

FRIEDMEYER What would you like?


BILL Something strong.

KIMBERLEY You look great.

BILL, What are you doing here?
f
FRIEDMEYER This way, Bill.  Please, sit.
 That was a most impressive win today.  Coming from
 that far back on a course as difficult as Wengen.
 You're quite a skier.

BILL It's all in the tuck.

FRIEDMEYER Don't your skis have a little to do with it?
BILL Yeh, a little.

FRIEDMEYER I'd like you to win the Olympics on a set Of Friedmyers.

BILL I ski on Atomics.  I'm sure Kimberley told you.

FRIEDMEYER Yes I know she did.  But I'm not certain she told you
 how anxious I am to have you represent my company.
g
BILL Well maybe she'll tell me about that later.

FRIEDMEYER Bill, I take good care of my skiers.  I want them to
 be happy.  Secure.  I'm prepared to offer you a very
 generous contract.

BILL I like Atomics.

FRIEDMEYER With Atomics you get skis.  With me you get anything
 you want.

BILL So I see.

FRIEDMEYER Bill, you seem like a bright young man.

BILL No, Mister Friedmeyer, I don't think so.  Apparently
 I'm just a dumb country boy.
 Excuse me.

KIMBERLEY Bill.  Come on, wait a sec, why are you leaving?
" 
}
BILL You get paid overtime?  I gotta hand it to you, Kimberley,
 you really know how to do your job.

KIMBERLEY Hey, look, why don't the two of us just go away for a
 couple of days.
 Mister Friedmyer has a chalet, in Saint Moritz.

BILL Oh, come on.  Ciao, Kimberley.

 Sarajevo, Yugoslavia

T.V. ANNOUNCER Now for the mens Downhill Race with America's Bill
 Johnson as one of the favourites.  Here's an interesting
 footnote.  In the history of the Winter Olympics.  No
 American man has ever won a gold medal on skis.  Not on
", the Downhill, not on the giant Solem, not on the slope,
 not on the cross country.  Not on the biothelum.
 Not on the ski jump.  So perhaps you can understand
 the importants of today's events.  So, let's go to
 the top of the mountain and find out what's happening.

BILLY Well, what's happening is a blizzard.  I'm afraid
 they'll be no mens Downhill Race today.

GIRL REPORTER So tell us, Bill, what do you think of the food here?

BILL Well, I didn't come to Yugoslavia to eat.

REPORTER 1 Two days of snow, Bill, how's that going to affect you?

BILL Not at all.  You see where I come from we ski on snow.
 More snow the better.  Unlike the European skiers, it
 just makes it easier for me to win.

REPORTER 2 Bill, you're the fastest qualifying time in practice.
 Think this delay is going to bother you?

BILL Look, you can't stop the inevitable.  I'm going to smoke
 these guys.  It's going to be a hell of a race., for
 second place.

REPORTER 3 in French.

BILL Sorry, no, no comprendo, amigo.

&)n
REPORTER 3 Hans Weiner say's he is going to set a new Olympic
 record here.

BILL Look, the closest he's gonna come to a record is
 hearing "The Star Spangled Banner" when they give
 me the gold medal.

REPORTER Good plug, Bill.

GIRL REPORTER You seem very confident that you can beat the Austrians.

BILL An, Austrians, Ruskies, Swiss, French, or Americans.  I'm
 going to win this thing.  Well go ahead, write it down.

REPORTERS ad lib dialogue.

BILL Coach.

MONTANA Did you win all that, playing pool?

WALLY Switzerland.  He hasn't in Switzerland for three weeks.
 He's in Yugoslavia.

MAILMAN Well, you know how the mail is.  Um, what's he say?
*7`
WALLY You mean you haven't read it?

MAILMAN Listen, we're in, we're all going to be here, you know.

WALLY Now, wait a minute, Frank.  I don't recall inviting
 anybody in my house.

MAILMAN I did.

WALLY Oh, you did?

MAILMAN Yeh, look,       Bill belongs to this community.  But, well
 most of us are coming over here because we love you, Wally.
 Without your help and advise, I mean, Bill wouldn't be over
 there representing the U.S. of A.
 That's why we're all coming over here.

MONTANA Where is everybody?
,I-
BILL Looks like we might have a little trouble getting home,

COWBOY in Russian.

MONTANA He's right.  We need a taxi.
 Bed check in fifteen minutes.

MONTANA Damn, what are we going to do?

COWBOY in Russian.

MONTANA What?

MONTANA I haven't been on a ride that good since Disneyland.

BILL Oh that was a good one.

MONTANA It was crazy.

BILL Right.
 You know something?  I think I'm scared.

MONTANA You're what?

BILL Think I'm scared.  Not of the mountain.  Or er, falling.
 I'm scared I've talked too much and I might not be able
 to back it up.
 Of course, now I think of it, I don't think there's
 anybody can really beat me any way.

 February 16, 1984
T.V. ANNOUNCER Well, finally after six days of snow, it's stopped.
.0W the sun has come out here in Sarajevo.  And the
 Yugoslavian Army has been working all night long
 to prepare the course for today's men's Downhill
 competition.
 The buzz on the course, is that Bill Johhson, will give
 America it's first ever Gold Medal.  in Alpine ....
 So, let's go to the top of the mountain.  Which our
 technicians have nick named Ice Station Zebra.
 Er, when you see this I think you'll understand why.
 It's cold.
 You are now looking at one point nine miles of
 treacherous terrain.  Lots of snow on it, but that's
2N Bill Johnson's kind of course.  He's a glider.
 Not so the Austrians, especially the perenial
 contender, Hans Weiner.  Probably known on the skiing
 circuit, The Cszar.
 This has not been his year, but this, his one hundreth
 downhill, might be his last.
 Johnson, after his stunning win at Wengen has suddenly
 become an odds on favourite.  To win it all.
