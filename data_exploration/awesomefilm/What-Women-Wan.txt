	I case they find...
383.03
	SCENE 74 - BACK ON COUPLE.
	DARCY:
	...Nick's idea too retro, which they 
might.
	They may hear elegant and think it's old
	fashioned, I'd be ready with some...
	maybe a dot com kind of thing?
	Maybe there's something about getting
	online and being online at the airport? 
I

	dazzled me. I mean, shook my world, changed

	feel that the price that you pay for being
	you, is that you don't get to have love.

764.00
	SCENE 58 - OTS ON HER.
	NICK:

	NICK:
	Everything about you, how smart you are,
	how good you are, everything just makes me
	want you even more. Oh, boy. It sort of

874.02
	SCENE 63 - OTS BACK ON NICK SURPRISED.
