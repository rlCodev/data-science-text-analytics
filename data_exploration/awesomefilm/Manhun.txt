EXT COASTAL ROAD - NIGHT

OPEN on a highway road in a remote coastal town.  We see CAR HEADLIGHTS 
approach,
and we see it's a CONVERTIBLE with the top down, an old 60's sportscar, beat-up but
cool.  

The driver is JIM TRUDELL; he winds his way down the road.
He's in good shape, and carries the look of a man who has seen and done much in his
32 years.  

The road is desolate, except for a lone ROADHOUSE BAR up in the distance.  Jim sees
it and heads toward it - 

										CUT TO
EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT

As Jim approaches it we see the lot littered with bikers and Harleys - regulars.

Jim slows down and pulls up into the driveway - 

We see two large men, LURCH and WEENER, stagger out the front door.  They are very
drunk and looking for trouble.

Jim gets out of his car, and coolly surveys the rowdy bar.  

Lurch stops and looks ahead - he sees Jim approach the front door.  He slaps Weener
on the arm - 
				LURCH
		How much you give me to fuck with 
		this guy?

 				WEENER
		How about nothin'?

				LURCH
		You're on.

Jim approaches the front door.  Lurch greets him gregariously - 

				LURCH
		A hearty good evening to ya. There's a 
		$50 dollar cover charge tonight.

Jim nods, realizing they're drunk.  He heads toward the front door, but Lurch
stands in front of him, blocking his access.
		
Jim smiles weakly at the idiot, simply wanting to get by.

				JIM
		Funny.

				LURCH
		Didn't you hear what I said?

Jim goes to head in, but Lurch stops him by jamming his HAND into Jim's CHEST -
Lurch smiles at him - 

				LURCH
		Fifty bucks.

Weener muffles a laugh.  Jim smiles, and calmly moves Lurch's hand away - 

				JIM
		Yeah I remember when I had my 
		first beer - goodnight, guys.

Lurch grabs Jim by the arm and yanks him back outside--he shoves his palm into
Jim's chest again--HARD--knocking Jim backwards--

				LURCH
		You should watch your attitude
		around here...

In a flash Jim grabs the mans's hand, twisting the wrist backwards, sending Lurch
to his knees--

 				JIM
		Thanks for the advice...

										CUT TO:
INT. BAR - NIGHT

The bar is smoky, loud, and crowded.  He winds his way through the unruly crowd to
the bar. 

He sees a SKELETAL, LEATHER-FACED BARTENDER, pouring whiskies and beers.  
He is at
the other end of the bar, serving a customer.

Jim scans the bar:  POOL PLAYERS, BIKER MUSIC, a rowdy crowd.

Then, suddenly, something catches Jim's eye - he tracks it across the room.

We see a sexy WOMAN enter--the head of every local patron turns in her direction.
She's clearly out of place in this establishment as she heads through the crowd,
arrives at a  payphone, and makes a call. 

Jim eyes her, as the bartender approaches him. She hangs up, apparently frustrated.
She seems apprehensive about something.

				BARTENDER
		What can I get ya?

				JIM
		You know the nearest place to stay
		around here?

				BARTENDER
			(shrugs)
		South of here. I dunno.

				JIM
		You know about how far down?

				BARTENDER
			    (irritated)
		What do I look like, a travel
		agent?  Now you want to order or
		what?

Jim reacts to the non-information he just received.  He'd just as soon leave, but
he sees the woman make her way toward the bar, not really noticing Jim.

Jim gestures to the tap - 

				JIM
		Give me a beer.

The bartender pours the shot, and plunks down the beer.  

				BARTENDER
		Three.

Jim pays and the bartender goes to the cash register.

The woman waits for the bartender, and looks over at Jim then scans the room,
before looking up at the TV behind the bar.

Jim takes this opportunity to inconspicuously glance at the woman - she takes note
of Jim - she is very sexy, a mysterious air about her.

She looks forward, at the TV - 

The bartender looks over the girl as he approaches her.



				BARTENDER
		What will it be, darlin'?

				WOMAN
		Stoli and tonic.

				BARTENDER
			   (stone-faced)
		We don't have - "Stoli" -  and
		I just ran out of tonic.

She looks at him - 

				WOMAN
		How about a glass of water.  Or are
		you out of glasses?

The bartender smirks and gets her some water.  Jim and the woman exchange looks - 

				JIM
		It's that kinda service that'll
		keep me comin' here...

The woman smiles faintly and looks ahead, preoccupied--

				LURCH(O.S.)
		Hey!  Hot dog!

The woman turns around to see the group surrounding them.  WEENER, LURCH, and 
three
big, mean BIKERS.  Lurch stares at Jim.  The others ogle the woman - 

The bartender scowls at the two men - 

				BARTENDER
		I told you two to get outta here!

Lurch stares down the bartender with hostile eyes.

				LURCH
		Make us, ya old fart...

The bartender grabs a sawed-off bat under the bar, but one of the bikers slams the
bartender's hand to the counter - 

Lurch then directs his attention to Jim, and the woman...

				LURCH
		Hot dog thinks he owns the place!

Jim shakes his head to himself, as if he knows what's gonna happen - it's routine
to him.

The woman senses real trouble but turns away, and plays it cool. 
				LURCH
		What's your name, sweet thing? 
			(gestures to Jim)
 		Are you with chickenshit here?  Huh?

Weener cackles along with the three other goons surrounding them.  Jim keeps his
cool.

				LURCH
		Huh?

Lurch staggers, then gains his footing.

				WEENER
		I think she's ignoring you, Lurch.

				LURCH
		Excuse me, but I'm talking to you.
		Are you ignoring me?

Then, finally, the woman slowly turns and looks Lurch up and down.
				WOMAN
		Now why would I want to ignore
		a fat, drunken slob like you?  

Lurch's buddies go "Oooooohhh," and laugh at this affront, but Lurch is not amused.

				LURCH
		You know, I ought to teach you
		some manners...

Lurch grabs the woman by the arm and YANKS her close to him.

Jim moves, yanking Lurch's hand off the girl and staring him down - 

				JIM
		That's it.  Show's over.

Lurch SWINGS - Jim DEFLECTS the punch and SMASHES Lurch across the face - 

Lurch crashes to the ground - 

Lurch staggers up and whips out a SWITCHBLADE, people back up - 

The woman looks at Jim, fearing the worst - 

Lurch takes a furious drunken SWING at Jim - 

Jim DUCKS and POW!! - grabs Lurch's wrist - 

Jim SLAMS the blade down into the felt of a POOL TABLE before delivering a
COMBINATION that sends Lurch spinning and crashing into a table of drinks - 

BIKER 1 SWINGS his mallet fist at Jim's face but Jim SLAPS it to a stop, twists it
hard - tendons SNAP as Jim flips him on his ass - 

Weener LUNGES and GRABS Jim around the waist, sending them to the ground - 

Jim FLIPS Weener off of him and rolls to his feet - as Weener staggers up and Jim
lands a DEVASTATING ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the skull which DROPS him - 

BIKER 2 approaches from behind but Jim BACKHANDS his face - 
BIKER 3 CONNECTS with Jim across the jaw - Jim LASHES INTO HIM with a 
combination
that SHATTERS his nose - 

Lurch SPRINGS to life brandishing a POOL CUE - people clear- 

Lurch charges Jim, SWINGING the cue furiously - we hear it WHIPPING through the air
- 

Jim waits for the right time before GRABBING the cue and wrenching it out of
Lurch's hands - 

Weener approaches from behind and Jim JUTS the back of the cue into his ribs - we
hear a bone CRACK - Jim SMASHES  him to the ground turning around just as Biker 2
CHARGES - 

Jim STABS the back of the cue into the biker's face and a LIGHTNING FAST kick sends
him colliding into the barstools - 

Lurch makes a final charge and WHAM!!! Jim SHATTERS the pool cue over Lurch's 
skull,
ending the melee.

Jim holds the broken cue, looking for anyone else who wants to start up - no one
does.

Then Jim looks toward the woman - she stares hard at him - 

He surveys the destruction - throws the pool cue to the ground - 

The bartender runs around the bar...

				BARTENDER
		Goddammit look at this!  Look at this!

				
				JIM
		Are you OK?		


				WOMAN
		Yeah...thank you.

Jim nods, and takes off toward the door - 

The woman watches him leave.


EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT

Jim gets into his car.

				WOMAN'S VOICE(O.S.)
		Hey.  Wait!

The woman approaches the car.  Jim looks at her.

				WOMAN
		Where are you going?

				JIM
			(Beat)
		Well I've kind of had my fill of 
		the place, you know what I mean?

				WOMAN
		You must be going somewhere.

				JIM
		I don't have any real destination.
		I'm just going South.

				WOMAN
		Mind if I come along for the ride?

He scrutinizes her for a second.

				WOMAN
		I'm stranded out here.

				JIM
			(Beat)
		Hop in.

The woman climbs in, and the car peels out onto the highway-

									DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The convertible books down the road - 
										CUT TO:
EXT CAR - NIGHT

Jim drives - the woman sits in the passenger seat.

				WOMAN
		Where did you learn to fight like
		that?
				JIM
			(Beat)
		I read a book.

				WOMAN
		Well, you saved me from a bad situation.
		Thanks.
			(Beat)
		I admit this is...unusual.

				JIM
		Are you a regular there?

				WOMAN
		Are you serious?  
			(Beat)
		My boyfriend ditched me...

				JIM
		Ditched you?
				
				WOMAN
		We were fighting - I told 
		him to let me out.
			(Beat)
		So where are you headed?

				JIM
		Bartender said there are motels
		south of here.

The woman looks out and then back at Jim.

				WOMAN
		Would you be into...getting a room?

Jim looks at her, then looks ahead, as if this is too good to be true:

				JIM
		What would your - boyfriend - think?

				WOMAN
		Screw him!

They drive silently for a beat; Jim is amused by the strangeness of the situation.

				JIM
		You don't seem afraid of much.

				WOMAN
		 Not with this...

At that point she looks at Jim and pulls a 9mm semi-automatic out of her purse -
she pulls back the chamber - Jim sees it, and smiles - 

				JIM
		You should have told me ahead of
		time, saved me the trouble.

There is a pause.  Neither says anything.  Then Jim extends his hand in friendship.

				JIM
		My name's Jim...

She looks at him, and shakes his hand.

				WOMAN
		Stephanie...  

The convertible heads down the dark road - 

									DISSOLVE TO:
EXT HOTEL - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT of blazing neon, pulling back to reveal the 

ROADSIDE MOTEL sign buzzing in the night air - 
										CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

We follow the neon glare through the windows of the cheap room.

We see two double beds.  Jim is lying on one, looking out the window, hands behind
his head.

We see Stephanie looking out the window, neon light reflecting on her face.  There
is a distant, preoccupied look in her eyes...

				JIM
		Afraid your boyfriend will show up?
 
Stephanie pauses, then looks at Jim:

				STEPHANIE
		You never know.  He can be...psychotic
		some times.

Jim senses she's lying but says nothing.

Stephanie changes the subject - 

				STEPHANIE
		So where are you from?

				JIM
		Up north.

				STEPHANIE
		Where up north?

				JIM
		Seattle.

				STEPHANIE
			(Beat)
		You got any family?

Jim looks out the window for a pause, reflecting.

				JIM
		No...

				STEPHANIE
		You're the mysterious type, right?

Jim looks at her and decides to play quid pro quo - 

				JIM
		I'm running from my psychotic 
		girlfriend.

The two exchange knowing looks.

				STEPHANIE
		OK, no more questions...

Stephanie heads over to the light.  

				STEPHANIE
		Mind if I turn out the light?

				JIM
		No...

She flips out the light and begins to undress.  Jim watches her.

				STEPHANIE
		You know, you don't seem afraid
		of much either.  How do you know 
		I'm not going to try to rape you?

				JIM
		Figure you would have tried it already.

The woman looks at him, continues to undress.  The neon light illuminates her body
in the dark room...

				JIM
		You always carry a gun with you?

				STEPHANIE
		No.

				JIM
		Only on dates?

The woman slides under the covers, her back facing Jim.

				STEPHANIE
		I just listen to my instincts.

Jim rolls over; he looks at her bare shoulders - 

				JIM
		What are your instincts telling 
		you now?

We see the woman looking at the wall, a preoccupied look on her face - 

				STEPHANIE
		Stay out of trouble...

Jim looks at her for a beat, then looks out the window...

								SLOW	DISSOLVE TO
INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Jim's eyes open slowly to the morning light - 

He discovers he's alone.

He gets up, checks the bathroom, checks the hallway, looks around - no sign of the
woman.

He stops, stands there, thinks, and laughs at how strange it was.  Then suddenly
something catches his eye - 

A KEY on the dresser, apparently to a BMW:

Jim inspects the key, then looks up -  something DAWNS ON HIM--
										CUT TO
EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

Jim runs out to find an EMPTY SPACE where his car once was - 

				JIM
		Son of a bitch!

Angered at his stupidity, Jim looks around, then looks at the key. 

Jim thinks for a second, then heads off.
										CUT TO
EXT ROADHOUSE BAR  - DAY

We see a TRUCK drive down the road. It slows and pulls over on the shoulder.

Jim exits the passenger side - 

				JIM
		Thanks.

The driver pulls away.  Jim crosses the street and looks around - the place is
closed up, desolate.

But lo and behold, around the corner...

There is a SHINY NEW BMW in the back parking lot.
He approaches the vehicle and slips the key into the driver's door - it slips right
in and the door opens.

				JIM
			(under his breath)
		Goddamn...

Jim climbs in - 
										CUT TO
INT BMW - DAY

Jim sits down and inspects the car.  He opens the glove compartment.  Finds the
registration.

The registration has a name - "Sarah Williams," and an address the Hollywood hills.
										CUT TO
EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - DAY

Jim heads to the payphone, carrying the registration.

He dials information, waits...

				OPERATOR(V.O.)
		Operator four nine, what city please?

				JIM
		Yes, Hollywood. Sarah Williams.

				OPERATOR(V.O.)
		Checking Hollywood...I'm not showing a
		listing for a Sarah Williams.

				JIM
		Thanks...

Jim hangs up, and looks back at the car.
										CUT TO
INT BMW - DAY

Jim gets in, thinks for a second, then smiles faintly to himself, then becomes
serious again...

He then closes the door, starts up the car - 

EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - DAY

Jim peels out in the BMW and heads down the road...

										CUT TO
EXT ROUTE 1 - DAY

Jim drives the Beemer down the highway - 

We see signs indicating that he is headed to Los Angeles, 50 miles south - 

MONTAGE of Jim making his way down Route one  - 

									DISSOLVE TO:
EXT CANYON ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

Jim pulls up a road leading to an exclusive canyon road, scattered with upscale
homes.  

He slows down, looking for street addresses - a WOMAN driving an expensive car
approaches and passes Jim - 

										CUT TO:
INT WOMAN'S CAR - NIGHT

The woman inspects Jim suspiciously through her rearview mirror and drives on--

										CUT TO:
INT BMW - LATE AFTERNOON

Jim continues to look for street numbers.
										CUT TO:
EXT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Jim pulls up and turns off the lights, parking in front of the house.  He looks at
it - 

It's a nice, remote house - shades drawn, no sign of life.

Jim gets out of the car, and heads to the door.

At first he hesitates, then he knocks lightly...no answer.
He looks around and tries the door - it's locked.

He looks around again and heads to the back of the house, hopping the wooden gate.

										CUT TO
EXT BACK DOOR - LATE AFTERNOON

He knocks again, this time a little harder.  This time the door CREAKS OPEN, as if
pulled open by a light wind, inviting trouble.

Jim hesitates again, then pokes his head inside - 

				JIM
		Hello?  Is anyone here?

Jim looks around - something catches his eye that causes him to go in...
										CUT TO
INT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Jim walks in and looks at the strange shapes in the dark - 
Soon we see the shapes are FURNITURE, drawers opened and dumped on the ground - 

Jim looks around - everywhere there is furniture stuffing, broken wood, emptied
drawers - 

Suddenly a LAMP CORD is wrapped tight around Jim's neck by a MAN behind him -

The man is a formidable opponent - Jim struggles to break free - the man yanks HARD,
tightening the cord with all his might - 

In a surge of energy Jim WRENCHES free and FLIPS the man, who crashes into a
BOOKCASE - 

The man staggers up and CHARGES Jim - the two SLAM against a wall - 

Jim doubles the man over with a blow to the RIBS, and sends him FLYING 
BACKWARDS
with a blow to the FACE - 

WHAM!  Jim lands a shattering kick to the head, breaking the man's neck - 

He spins and crashes into a glass COFFEE TABLE - DEAD.

Jim looks at the unconscious man for a beat before seeing if he's still alive - 

He feels for a pulse - the face is frozen as Jim checks for signs of life - 

He flips open the man's coat, and finds his WALLET...

But soon the lights from POLICE CARS begin to cut red streaks of light through the
room - 

Jim opens the wallet - 

And sees a POLICE BADGE...Lieutenant Tom Fleming LAPD.

				JIM
		Oh shit...

Jim reacts to this discovery as we hear tires SCREECHING out at the front door - 

Jim whips around and looks toward the front door - 

BANG!  The door flies open and we see two UNIFORMED OFFICERS burst in, guns 
aimed - 

One of them whips around the corner and sees Jim - 

				COP1
		Freeze - lemme see your hands!! Now!

Jim puts his hands up - 

The other cop bursts in, and heads to the dead body - 

				COP1
		Hands!!  Put 'em up or you
		will be shot!!  Turn around!

Jim puts his hands up and turns around - 

Cop2 approaches the man on the ground, feels his pulse - then picks up the wallet,
sees the ID - 
 
				COP2
		Shit...he's a goddamn lieutenant - 

Jim starts to turn around - 

				JIM
		He was trying to kill me!

				COP1
		I said don't move you son-of
		a-bitch!  You wanna die right here?!

				COP2
		I'm calling it in - 

Jim looks at the wall, the awful circumstances sinking in...

										CUT TO:
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

We see an ambulance, other patrol cars, and onlooking neighbors.

An unmarked car pulls up and out steps CAPTAIN RAYMOND DOYLE, a tough, street-
wise
black officer in his 40's.  He is followed by JOHNNY MARVOSA, a well-muscled but
haggard-looking detective in his mid thirties, with a grim expression on his face.  

They get out and are approached by one of the original uniformed officers on the
scene as he heads toward the front door.

				DOYLE
		What do we have?

Cop2 produces a wallet and hands it to Doyle, who opens it with a sober expression
on his face.

				COP1
		Detective Tom Fleming, from Central
		division.  He was dead before we 
		got here.		

				DOYLE
		Shit...what the hell was he doing 
		up here?

				COP2
		Off duty?  Who knows. The house is trashed, 
		and the suspect isn't saying much.

				DOYLE
		Where is this - suspect?


				COP2
		Inside.
										CUT TO

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

Doyle and Marvosa head in to see the wrecked room, and the suspect, Jim Trudell,
getting handcuffed by Cop1.

				DOYLE
		Who lives here?

				COP2
		Car's registered to a Sarah Williams.
		The neighbor across the street saw 
		the suspect driving the car, and 
		hopping the fence to the backyard.
				
Doyle looks at Cop1.

				DOYLE
		Did you read him his rights?

				COP2
		Yeah... 

Doyle goes over to Jim and looks at him;  Doyle immediately dislikes and suspects
Jim, and he cuts through the bullshit.

				DOYLE
		Alright, where is she?

				JIM
		And who are you?

				DOYLE
		Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst 
		fucking nightmare until you start
		breaking it down for me.  You
		understand? Where did you get the car!

				JIM
		I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.  

The two men stare hard at each other--

									DISSOLVE TO
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

We see Jim, distraught and deep in reflection over the situation...

Sheriff Doyle grills Jim, along with MARVOSA.  An inexperienced pencil- necked
PUBLIC DEFENDER shuffles papers.  
				JIM
		No - that's not it!  She said her 
		boyfriend stranded her up there!
		I didn't ask her to come with me!

				MARVOSA
		Did you have sex with her?

				JIM
		What?

				MARVOSA
		Did you have sexual intercourse
		with the woman in question?

				JIM
		No.  It wasn't like that!

				MARVOSA
		Then what did you do, play canasta?

				DEFENDER
		I - uh, believe my client has asnwered
		that question sufficiently...

Jim looks over at his lamebrain lawyer with apprehension - 

				DOYLE
			(Beat)
		Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone.
		But--
			(to Marvosa)
		--this is my favorite part--
			(to Jim)
		she leaves you the keys to 
		a brand new Beemer.

				JIM
		She stole my car!!

				MARVOSA
		Bullshit...

				DOYLE
		Did you report it stolen?

In response, Jim says nothing.  It doesn't look good for him.


Doyle stares long and hard at Jim, convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt he is
guilty.  Jim realizes his story is sketchy at best.  

				DOYLE
		So...
			(to Marvosa)
		to get the car back, you break into
		her house.

				JIM
		I didn't break in - the back door 
		was open!

				DOYLE
		Yeah, it was opened - 
		   (shouting in Jim's face)
 		with a goddamn screwdriver!!!

Doyle steps back, gains composure - 

				DOYLE
		I gotta tell you something, son.
		I think you're trying to make a
		fool of me.  You're driving a stolen car,
		the owner is missing, her house is
		ransacked, and a police officer's dead!

Doyle gets up - 

Jim looks at the men - 

				JIM
		I told you it was self-defense!
		He was trying to kill me! 

Doyle looks back at him in disgust - 

				MARVOSA
		You can cut the shit, asshole--

				DOYLE
		we've got kidnapping, grand theft
		auto, burglary, and two counts of
		murder on you, and I'm gonna see to
		it personally that it sticks!

He looks at Marvosa - 

				DOYLE
		Take him down to C.J.  Get him 
		out of my sight.  
										CUT TO:

EXT HALLWAY

A door bursts open as Jim and Marvosa head down the hall - Marvosa shoves him
forward - 

They are approached by STANTON, a long-faced plainclothes 
detective who joins them.  

He and Marvosa exchange knowing looks.

EXT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Stanton and Marvosa lead Jim into an unmarked car - 

				JIM
		Where am I going?

				MARVOSA
		County jail - get in.

They shove him in the backseat and get in.  
										CUT TO
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unmarked car makes its way down the road - 
										CUT TO
INT UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Stanton and Marvosa seem preoccupied; they say nothing, looking cautiously out the
windows.

Jim looks out the window.  They're heading into strange territory - turning off
toward an INDUSTRIAL ROAD - 

Jim does not know why he's going there.  He wants to say something, but hesitates.

The cops say nothing, looking out the window. 
										CUT TO
EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The unmarked car pulls up to the warehouse.
They take Jim out of the car...

				JIM
		What the hell is this?

Suddenly, Stanton clenches his jaw and SQUEEZES the cuffs tight around Jim's wrists
- 

Jim winces in pain as the metal tears into his wrists - 

				JIM
		Aaah - Jesus! - 

Brandishing a NIGHTSTICK, Marvosa looks around and hastily unlocks the door as they
drag JIM into the warehouse - 

										CUT TO
INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Marvosa and Stanton shove Jim into the warehouse - 

				JIM
		What are you, crazy!!

Jim skids to the floor - as he goes to get up Marvosa SMASHES him with the
nightstick - Stanton stands on the back of Jim's knees and ties up his feet with
rope - 

Marvosa relents and Jim writhes on the ground, unable to protect himself.
				STANTON
		Now...

They drag Jim toward a WATER TROUGH (serving some industrial purpose) - 
				STANTON
		...you're going to tell us everything.
		You're gonna tell us where the whore
		is heading, what she told you - everything.

				JIM
		I don't know anything about her - 
		what the hell do you want???!!!					
They grab him by the throat and SHOVE his face in the dirty water - Jim struggles
but the two cops are clearly in charge-

They use all their force and keep him down for a while - Marvosa BASHES Jim in the
ribs, causing him to exhale, and swallow water - after a nerve-racking length, they
pull his head up - 

				MARVOSA
		This is nothing, man!  Now you're
		going to die tonight, understand?  You
		just have to decide how you want to 
		do it.  The easy way or the - 

SPLASH!!! His head is angrily slammed back into the water - 

				MARVOSA
		 - hard way!!!

Stanton chokes Jim hard - Marvosa JAMS the club into his ribs - 

Jim coughs underwater - BLOOD runs from his mouth as he exhales hard and swallows
another mouthful of water - 

The two men hold him down, then pull his head - he coughs and gasps for air - 

				STANTON
		What's it gonna be hard ass?
		Start talking - 

Jim struggles to catch his breath - long enough to SPIT hard in Stanton's face - 

				JIM
		Fuck you!
										CUT TO
INT WAREHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

We see Jim's handcuffed HANDS being hoisted up on an industrial hook - his shirt is
ripped off - 

Jim swings in the air as Marvosa CLUBS HIM HARD with the billy club - 

Stanton heats an IRON ROD with an ACETYLENE TORCH - 

				MARVOSA
		You know, I'd really like to believe
		you because I got better things to do
		with my night, understand?  I got 
		a c-note on the Colts Dolphins game and
		I'm sitting here with a scumbag that's 
		lying to me!!!

Jim appears out of it - 

				JIM
		You're...crazy...

				STANTON
		No... 

Stanton STABS the RED HOT IRON into Jim's chest - he SCREAMS, instantly coming 
to
life - 

				STANTON
		...you're stupid!

Stanton pulls the iron away - Jim grimaces in agony on the hook - Stanton looks up
at him - 

				STANTON
		Now where...is...the whore?		

				JIM
		I told you...I don't know...
		anything...

Marvosa SMASHES Jim hard with the club - the blows rain down  as his body swings
from the hook - 

				STANTON
		Then this is going to be a very long 
		night for you - 

BAM!!! In an unexpected surge of energy Jim KICKS Stanton HARD in the face and his
head SMASHES into the concrete wall, bone SMACKING LOUDLY as he collapses -

DOYLE arrives and quickly heads over to Marvosa - behind him a K-9 OFFICER (or
officers) leads the German shepherd out of the back of a patrol car - 

An agitated Doyle approaches Marvosa - 

				DOYLE
		What the hell happened?

				MARVOSA
		He busted the back window with his 
		feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued 
		him into this warehouse - but he's - 
		gone, south - maybe a couple of miles 
		if he's fast - 

				DOYLE
		Why didn't you call for back-up!  
		What were you thinking, Jesus!!!

				MARVOSA
		It happened too fast.  He was in 
		the back, quiet and calm and boom!
		He was out - and gone.
			(Beat)
		We...we fanned out...Stanton must 
		have let his guard down!

Doyle seems disgusted by this.

				DOYLE
		I don't know how you're used to
		doing things, Marvosa, but it
		sounds like some damn sloppy  
		work to me!

				MARVOSA
		Oh for Chrissakes it could have
		happened to anyone of--





				DOYLE
		Bullshit!  Another officer dead?! There's 
		no excuse for this!  Now I want this son-
		of-a-bitch back in custody tonight, you 
		understand?

Doyle looks at the other officers around him - 
 
				DOYLE
		Does everyone understand?!  We have a 
		cop killer on the loose.  I want to set 
		a wider perimeter - three miles - units 
		at Baldwin, Temple, Nelson and Austin.
		No vehicles come in or out! We're looking 
		for a man in his 30's six feet, one 
		eighty-five, dark hair, black jacket,

Doyle turns to another officer -

		And get me  two air units down here now!  
		If the body's still warm there's nowhere 
		he can run.

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Bleeding and shirtless, Jim runs down the alley as fast as he can - 

At the end of the alley there is an old, bearded HOMELESS MAN asleep and wrapped in
a blue plastic tarp.  Next to him is a shopping cart full of broken junk and grungy
clothes.

Jim approaches the cart and gingerly digs through it - he finds a small, old ripped
FLANNEL SHIRT which he takes out - he also finds a DIRTY SOCK (or rag) - he ties
the sock tight above his wound - the man STIRS...suddenly we hear the sound of
ROTORS - 

Jim DIVES back in a dangerously narrow hiding spot - the INSTANT a HELICOPTER 
ROARS
overhead, beaming a powerful and precise WHITE LIGHT through the narrow alleyway 
- 

The bum stirs, and Jim freezes in place - 

The helicopter light then falls DIRECTLY onto the sleeping man and stays there -

It peers down on the bum, who  wakes up to the blinding light engulfing him - and
angrily FLIPS THE BIRD to the helicopter -

The helicopter light SLOWLY heads down the alley and disappears over a rooftop - 

The bum's head drops back to sleep - 

Jim cautiously steps out and makes his way down the alley -

EXT ALLEY

An officer approaches Doyle and Marvosa - 

				OFFICER
		Well, the dogs found a blood trail, so 
		we know he's wounded. 

				MARVOSA
		I clipped him pretty good.

Doyle heads over to a cell phone in an unmarked car - 

				DOYLE
		So...either we find his stiff ass in
		an alley or we nail him at a hospital.
		Helps the odds a little.

Just then we see SHELLEY ZYDOWSKI, a skinny, bespectacled no-nonsense fingerprint
specialist approach Doyle as Doyle heads toward a police car - Marvosa listens
attentively - 

				DOYLE
		Zydowski.  It's about time.

				ZYDOWSKI
		You won't like this.  I ran the prints
		from the house.  No police record on
		your suspect--at least not in our files.
		But there is a match on the girl.

				DOYLE
		Yeah?

				ZYDOWSKI
		Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, 
		convicted for soliciting two years ago.

				DOYLE
		What?  Wait a minute - 

				ZYDOWSKI
		That's not all.  According to the 
		computer - she died of a drug
		overdose last year.

				DOYLE
			(sarcastically)
		That's great Zydowski, you tech guys
		are really on the ball.
			(to another officer)
		Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, 
		run the prints through their library, see
		if it's less screwed-up than ours...

				OFFICER'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Captain!

An officer runs over to Doyle - then holds up the HANDCUFFS- 

				OFFICER
		We found these in the alley.

Doyle sees this and snatches them out of his hand - 

				DOYLE
		What the hell is this Marvosa!!

				MARVOSA
		He must have got the keys... off Stanton.

				DOYLE
		Great. Well that changes a lot...

Marvosa looks around, this is getting bad for him - 

				MARVOSA
		I'm going to look for him on my own.
		Fuck this.

				DOYLE
		We're all gonna fan out!
			(to an officer)
		C'mon, let's do a sweep of the
		alleys - 

As Marvosa heads off, Doyle slaps a new cartridge into his gun - 

				DOYLE
		And Marvosa!

Marvosa stops, looks at him - Doyle approaches him - 

				DOYLE
		Don't take any chances.  Call for 
		back-up this time!

				MARVOSA
		Don't worry - 

Marvosa does the same with his weapon, before heading away - 

				MARVOSA
		He's a dead man...

Marvosa heads into an UNMARKED CAR and drives off -

An ASSISTANT walks in and addresses Donovan--

				ASSISTANT
		You got LAPD on line four.

Donovan looks at his watch as if it's a little late for this, then nods at the
assistant..  

He picks up the phone -


				DONOVAN
		Lab, agent Donovan...

Donovan listens for a while, then flips a switch on his computer--
				DONOVAN
		Well, I'll see what we've got,
		send the prints over.

The prints start to come over the computer--we see the prints begin to emerge on
the screen as the computer scans it's files--soon a completed fingerprint emerges.
The computer beeps and reads "MATCH VERIFIED."

				DONOVAN
			Bingo.

Donovan executes another command to bring up the information on the print, when
suddenly a window appears over the screen reading "IDENTITY CONTROL  - CODE 
11A."
At the bottom of the screen we see a message reading "ACCESS RESTRICTED - 
DISCLOSE
NO INFORMATION."

Donovan has a look of concern--

Doyle backs off in disgust, and gestures to a uniformed officer -

		Get their statement and get them

INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY

We see Marvosa head over to a SODA MACHINE, with a preoccupied look hanging 
heavy
on his face - 

Another PLAINCLOTHES COP approaches Marvosa as he puts some change in the 
machine - 

				PLAINCLOTHES
		Hey man...

He pats Marvosa shoulder -

				PLAINCLOTHES
		I'm sorry.  I heard about last night.

				MARVOSA
		Yeah...

				PLAINCLOTHES
		I heard Doyle went off on you.  I don't
		know if I like that some-bitch too
		much.
				MARVOSA
		He's not used to the way we do things.
		Well, you know, he's from the 77th.  
		Coming here, trying to be a hard-ass,
		trying to prove himself.

				DOYLE(O.S.)
		Marvosa!

We see Doyle making his way down the hall - 

				DOYLE
		Come with me!

The plainclothes cop looks at Marvosa, who bangs the button on the machine and gets
his soda - 

				PLAINCLOTHES
		Don't you take any shit from him.

				MARVOSA
		I don't take shit from anyone, Meadows.
		You know that.

Marvosa catches up with Doyle - 

				MARVOSA
		What did the six-toes have to say?

				DOYLE
		Sarah Williams left the bar with
		Trudell on her own. 

				MARVOSA
		So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too.  
		It doesn't rule out foul play.

				DOYLE
		But what was a hair dresser from Malibu
		doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?

				MARVOSA
		I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was 
		looking for love...

Doyle glares at Marvosa - 

				DOYLE
		Yeah - funny.
			(Beat)
		There's something else I	don't 
		understand...I still wanna know 
		why Fleming was up in Malibu last night.

Marvosa nods in fake agreement.

				DOYLE
		Find out for me.

				MARVOSA
		Fine...

Just then an officer approaches the two men--


				OFFICER
		Captain there's someone here to see
		you - he's waiting in your office.

				DOYLE
		Who is it?

				OFFICER
		I don't know - but he's from the FBI.

										CUT TO
INT DOYLE'S OFFICE - DAY

Doyle opens the door to his office, Marvosa behind him.

We see SPECIAL AGENT CRAIG, a trim man in his 40's with graying temples.  He 
stands
and introduces himself--

				CRAIG
		Captain Doyle?

				DOYLE
		Yeah?

Craig shows his credentials and shakes Doyle's hand.

				CRAIG
		Special Agent Craig, FBI.

Doyle inspects the credentials and looks up at Craig, unimpressed.

				DOYLE
		What can I do for you?

				CRAIG
		Your department contacted our agency
		regarding information on Sarah Williams.

				DOYLE
		Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.


				CRAIG
		Not on her.  But as for Jim Trudell...
		do you mind if I close the door?

Doyle waves his hand at the door and Craig closes it.

				CRAIG
		We did a little digging on Jim Trudell
		at Sergeant Zydowski's request.
		He's 31, no priors, and he's been working
		for the military for ten years.  

				DOYLE
		We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.

				CRAIG
		I don't think you understand.
		I don't mean shuffling papers in an
		office, I mean Jim Trudell worked 
		classified assignments, special 
		forces...sabotage...until last year.
		He was brought up on charges of
		espionage, but the charges were
		later dropped, and he sprang the
		service.

				DOYLE
			(surprised)
		Yeah?..well what are you getting at?
		You saying he has an agenda down here?

				CRAIG
		Our agency monitors all threats very
		carefully, and there's good reason
		to believe Jim Trudell has the training,
		the connections, and the experience
		to present a clear threat to the public
		if he remains at large.

				DOYLE
		If what you're saying is true, then why
		would he have killed two police officers?
		A man like that would want to lay low,
		if he was planning some kind of damn
		sabotage mission!

				CRAIG
		That's the point.  He slipped up, and
		he's desperate now.  And that means 
		he's all the more dangerous.

The two men look at each other.


				CRAIG
		I'm sure if our departments
		cooperate we can find out the truth.
		
				DOYLE
		Cooperate?

				CRAIG
		Every step of the way.

				DOYLE
		If you guys want in, fine.  Just
		remember this is our jurisdiction.	
			
Doyle gets up, looks out the window - 

Just then a uniformed officer enters the room - 

				OFFICER
		Captain we got a store owner in Venice,
		made a stone-cold ID of Trudell about 
		fifteen minutes ago.

Doyle and Marvosa look at each other - 

				DOYLE
		Goddamn he made it into Venice!
		OK we're back on the road!  
		Notify all units, tell them we're
		on our way.

Doyle and the men get up to leave - 

				DOYLE
			(to Marvosa)
		Let's roll - 

				MARVOSA
		Right behind you.

As Doyle leaves Marvosa heads to a phone and quickly dials - 

				MARVOSA
		It's Marvosa - get down to Venice.

He hangs up - suddenly - BWEEEP!! We hear the single BLIP of a POLICE SIREN - 

Jim JUMPS, and casually turns around - 

The COP is admonishing a BIKE RIDER -

		Walk the bike.

Jim turns around and displays clear signs of relief as he waits.

Jim heads off down the boardwalk.

Doyle, Craig, and Marvosa pull up into a Venice alley, and are met by FOOT PATROL,
BIKE PATROL, and other UNIFORMED OFFICERS - 

The men get out of the car and Doyle addresses them - 

				DOYLE
		Alright, we know who we're looking
		for.  Play it cool until the time
		is right to make a move.  Let's not 
		pull any gangbusters shit or we'll 
		lose him again.  

				CRAIG
		Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation
		on our hands.

Doyle slaps a new cartridge in his gun, looks at some of the bike patrol cops - 


				DOYLE
		If you can trail him to a remote area
		do it. We all want a piece of him but 
		let's keep our heads and stay within the 
		law - we got people everywhere out here.

				MARVOSA
		These crowds are going to make it
		a bitch!

				DOYLE
		I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want 
		to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning 
		at the north and south ends from Marine 
		to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the 			
	boardwalk. 

Marvosa heads over to Doyle and Craig- 

				MARVOSA
		I'll take the south end - 

				DOYLE
		Fine - 				

				CRAIG
		You mind if I ride with you?

				DOYLE
		Yeah, stick around, you might learn

The skateboarder recognizes him -

Jim casually looks behind his shoulder, and his worst fears are confirmed - 

The skateboarder is clearly HONING IN on him - 

Jim realizes this and looks ahead, walking a little faster -

		No...

		Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't

		Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't

		Oh man...what happened?

		I don't know.  But I'm in trouble.

		OK, I'm logged on to the municipal

Tubbs types on the computer - taking a CHOCOLATE DONUT out of a box and takes a

				TUBBS
		Donut?

				JIM
		No thanks.  How do you know they
		can't catch you on this thing?

				TUBBS
		I don't, but I'm pretty sure.
		It's a long story but I cloned a
		cellular linkup with a binary

				JIM
		I knew I could count on you.

				TUBBS
		I got a lot of free time, you know

Tubbs has accessed something on his computer - 


				JIM
		OK...county tax records...they're 
		saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by...
		an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they
		have a P.O. box in D.C.

				JIM
		How about Marvosa and the others?

				TUBBS
		I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but
		we gotta be careful - that one's 
		kind of tricky - 

Tubbs types diligently on the computer - 

				TUBBS
		So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I
		figure you'd be in some far off
		place somewhere, living on the edge
		like the good old days.

				JIM
		I gave all that up.  I got tired of
		the lies. They wanted to stuff me in 
		Levenworth to cover their asses on a 
		botched assignment.  It got so I didn't 
		know who to trust anymore...
			(laughs cynically)
		...some things never change, I guess.

Tubbs looks at Jim - 

				TUBBS
		You know this time, there's nobody
		that's gonna cover your ass. You're
		over your head this time.

				JIM
		What else is new?				

He begins typing again - the computer beeps -

Zydowsky dusts for prints as Craig and Doyle watch Marvosa come in.  Doyle
addresses Zydowsky inside the car - 

				DOYLE
		What do we have in there?

				ZYDOWSKY
		What don't we have in here?  We
		have CD player, radar detector, 
		cell phone - 

Zydowsky digs through the car and pulls out a HANDGUN using a pencil through the
trigger - 

				ZYDOWSKY
		Automatic weapons...

Marvosa heads over - 

				MARVOSA
		What's this?

				DOYLE
		Our getaway car. 
			(to Zydowsky)
		You said a cell phone?

				ZYDOWSKY
		Yeah...

				DOYLE
		That might just be our ticket.

				MARVOSA
		What do you mean?

				ZYDOWSKI
		Maybe Jim Trudell called someone from
		the car.

				MARVOSA
		He'd have to be really stupid to
		pull that.  I mean - he must have
		known we would find the car.

				ZYDOWSKI
		Maybe...but it would be even stupider
		not to check it out.

Doyle turns to Marvosa - 

				DOYLE
		Get the information for us.  Call the
		phone company, find out what calls
		were made on this extension over the
		last 48 hours.

Marvosa plays it cool - 

				MARVOSA
		You got it.

Doyle considers something else - 

				DOYLE
		It's safe to assume that this guy
		has some kind of weapon on him...

				ZYDOWSKY
		Well he had quite a selection to
		choose from.
			(Beat)
		The question is - who's his next
		target?

Marvosa eyes the car.  He seems nervous about something.

				DOYLE
		Marvosa--when did you join the force?

This question catches Marvosa off- guard - he looks and sees Doyle examining
Marvosa's reaction to the question carefully- 
 
				MARVOSA
		What?

				DOYLE
		When did you join the force?  You know,
		the police force, the place you work...

				MARVOSA
			(Beat)
		Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking 
		difference does it make?

				DOYLE
		Did you start out area six?

				MARVOSA
		Yeah...

The two look at each other - 

				DOYLE
		So you must have known Fleming...
		and Stanton - 

				MARVOSA
		Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked
		vice.

				DOYLE
		Well don't you think that's odd?

				MARVOSA
		What?


				DOYLE
		It's kind of a funny coincidence, 
		isn't it?

				MARVOSA
		Gotta come from somewhere...

				DOYLE
		Where do you come from, Marvosa?

Marvosa looks hard at him - 

				MARVOSA
		Traffic...

Doyle nods, looking at him...

				DOYLE
		Just wondering if maybe they had a
		thing going with this hooker, you
		know, some connection.

				MARVOSA
		Hey what they did on their time was their
		business, you know?  I just want to
		catch this scumbag, wherever he is.

Suddenly an officer pops his head in--

				OFFICER
		Captain?

				DOYLE
		Yeah?

				OFFICER
		LAPD data center reports a breach
		on the system.  An outside hacker
		has accessed files on Detectives
		Fleming and Stanton...and yours
		too, Marvosa.

				MARVOSA
		Outside hacker?  What the fuck are
		you talking about?

				DOYLE
		That's got to our secret agent man!
		Do we have an address?

				OFFICER
		Yeah - 


				DOYLE
		Alright, I want SWAT on that building
		right away.  Let's get down there and
		find out what the hell is going on.

Doyle, Marvosa, and Zydowski head out--

Marvosa starts to move as well.  Doyle turns to him.

				DOYLE
		Something wrong with you Marvosa?

				MARVOSA
			(sighs, exhausted)
		It's just...catching up with me,
		you know?

				DOYLE
		Well why don't you sit this one 
		and get some rest...you look like shit.

INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tubbs and Jim are going over the numbers from Marvosa's phone extension - a few
have been crossed off - 

				TUBBS
		OK...Marvosa makes calls to this
		fax number overseas.  And that's
		Switzerland's country code.

				JIM
		A bank?

				TUBBS
		Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army
		knives. I can't access that, but look 
		what we have here...these are the 
		account records for Fleming and Marvosa.

				JIM
		Both at the same bank...

			  	TUBBS
		And look at the balances...these aren't
		police salaries...

INSERT on the screen, which displays balances of well over half a million dollars...

				JIM
		Where are they getting all this money?...		

Tubbs meets resistance as he tries to enter in further - 
				TUBBS
		Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped
		out.  I'm getting denied access all 
		over the place...

				JIM
		It's not very much to go on...is
		there anything else we can check?

				TUBBS
		Shit, we just started.  But I better 
		log out of this.
		
Suddenly the PHONE RINGS - 

Jim and Tubbs look at one another - 

Tubbs puts it on speakerphone - and after a few rings, answers - 

				TUBBS
		Hello?

There is a pause before we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE - the voice of STEPHANIE - 

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		I want to speak to Jim Trudell...

Tubbs and Jim look at each other - Jim reacts with surprise  

				TUBBS
		I think you got the wrong number - 

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		I know he's there.  If you want to live,
		you'll listen to me.

Tubbs and Jim are taken aback by this - 

				TUBBS
		Who is this! How the hell did you...

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		There are five squad cars on the way
		to you right now.  You've got to get out
		of there...I'll meet you at the 
		brick building on the corner of 
		Silverbay and Hoyt Park as soon as
		you can get there.

		
				JIM
		What's going on here?

				STEPHANIE (V.O.)
		You'll find out - soon enough.

There is a CLICK and the caller hangs up - 

				TUBBS
		Oh - man!  Now they've gone and
		done it!

Tubbs begins grabbing up floppy disks and crumbling up pieces of paper - 

				TUBBS
		Man they're going to skin me alive!
		How the hell did they find out?!!

Jim gets up - 

				JIM
		That was her - the girl... 
		We have to go.

				TUBBS
		I'm not going anywhere! 

				JIM
		Tubbs, these people mean business.

				TUBBS
		I told you I'm not going anywhere!
		I got my whole life in this place!
			(Beat, thinking)
		I'll just destroy the evidence and
		play dumb.

Tubbs pulls out a HANDGUN from a drawer and checks to see it's loaded - 

				TUBBS
		I can't help you anymore, Jimmy.
		I'm sorry.

				JIM
		I'm going to need a way to get there.

Tubbs pulls a set of KEYS out of a drawer and tosses them to Jim - 
				TUBBS
		There's a Harley in the garage I 
		don't exactly use anymore. Take
		it.

Jim goes to head out, and looks back at Tubbs -

				JIM
		Are you going to be alright?

				TUBBS
		Don't worry about me...
			(gesturing to a helmet 
			on the wall)
		...and don't forget your helmet.
		You don't want to get a ticket.			

Jim grabs the helmet off the wall -

We see a foot CRASH OPEN the apartment door - 

Tubbs checks his gun tucked into the side flap of the wheelchair - he turns around -

and see MARVOSA enter the room - 

				TUBBS
		Don't you guys ever knock?

				MARVOSA
		Where is he?

				TUBBS

		Long gone...
				MARVOSA
		Well you won't mind if I don't

		Hello, Jim.  

Jim moves toward her, but immediately feels a gun is at his neck.

				CRAIG
		Hands in the air.

Agent Craig is there, he begins frisking Jim - 

Jim stares at Stephanie.  She returns his gaze.

				STEPHANIE
		I understand there's a lot of people

		can feel.
									CUT TO:

INT DIFFERENT PART OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jim, Craig, and Stephanie are seated in a room - 

				JIM
		Why did you set me up?

				STEPHANIE
		I didn't.  I figured you leave it well
		enough alone.

				JIM
		Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm
		public enemy number one.  You have an
		answer for that? 

				STEPHANIE
		I had to get away!  My life was in
		danger!

				JIM
		Look what are you anyway? Some kind 
		of spy?
		
				STEPHANIE
		No.  A witness.  

				JIM
			(Beat)
		What exactly did you see?

				STEPHANIE
		Six months ago, a police lieutenant
		named Charles Fletcher was found dead
		in a hotel room - he blew his brains
		out - left no note, you may have 
		heard of it...

				JIM
		No, but I'm listening.

				STEPHANIE
		I was there, and it was no suicide.  
		He was killed by professionals.
			(to Tubbs)
		I was in the bathroom when it
		happened.

				JIM
		Didn't these - professionals - figure he 
		had a girl in the room?

				STEPHANIE
		Yeah...they did.  One girl...

									DISSOLVE TO
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Camera TRACKS as we see the hotel room, scattered with lingerie, a pair of men's
pants, etc.

We then see Stephanie, naked, in bed with state prosecutor CHARLES FLETCHER and
another naked woman.  They look as if they've just finished a sex marathon.  

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		Charlie Fletcher liked to move around
		a lot, but he was a regular.  And he
		paid for the kink.

Stephanie seductively wraps a sheet around her, gets out of bed and heads to the
bathroom,  as Fletcher starts up again with the other girl.

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Stephanie heads into the bathroom, closes the door, and pulls a cellular phone out
of her purse.

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		I had to call another appointment
		and cancel.  Fletcher wanted to party
		all night, and he made it worth my
		while.  But then I heard the front
		door open...and I heard voices...

We see Stephanie listen and react to what she hears - 

				FLETCHER(V.O.)
		What the hell are you doing here!

				MARVOSA(V.O.)
		Stomping a pigeon.

				STANTON(V.O.)
		You're done rocking the boat Fletcher.

POP!  We hear the sound of a silenced shot - 

				FLETCHER(V.O.)
		Jesus!!!  Don't kill me - please!!

				MARVOSA
		You're gonna take care of that!

Stephanie hears THUMPING and STRUGGLING - 

				FLETCHER (V.O.)
		Let go! Aaaahhh--

POP!  another shot, then silence - and the door closes.

EXT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Stephanie slowly exits the bathroom.

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		It seemed like I waited for ever before
		coming out, and when I did I saw them.

We see Fletcher and the other girl, with bullet holes in the head.

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		They were dead.  No struggle, no 
		commotion - just dead.

INT WAREHOUSE

Stephanie has a distant look on her face, recalling the night's events - 
 
				JIM
		And what did you do?

				STEPHANIE
		I got out of there.	I just grabbed 
		up my stuff, and then I found it.

				JIM
		Found what?

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Stephanie crawls around, frantically picking up her things off the ground.


				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		I was grabbing up everything I had
		when I noticed something behind the
		curtain.

Stephanie scrutinizes the curtain and stands up, approaching it-

She gets closer and YANKS the curtain open - 

We see a small VIDEO CAMERA perched on the window sill, pointed straight at the bed
looking through the break in the two curtains - 

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		It seems Charlie liked to watch.  Over
		and over.

Stephanie picks up the VIDEO CAMERA and holds it up to her eye - 

She rewinds - then plays the tape -  

POV EYEPIECE - 

We see the GRAINY VIDEO IMAGES of the three in bed, having sex - she fast forwards
and plays - they have changed positions - she fast forwards and plays -  and we see
Stephanie get out of bed.

We see Stephanie react to this - 

POV TAPE - 

We see Fletcher and the other girl getting busy when two men walk in - STANTON and
MARVOSA - 

Fletcher and the woman have enough time to sit up before Marvosa fires at the woman
in bed - 

Stephanie reacts - 

POV TAPE - 

We then see Stanton and Marvosa force Fletcher to grab the gun and POW! blow his
brains out against the headboard -   
When it's done, Marvosa and Stanton  quickly and quietly leave.

Stephanie turns off the tape - and ejects the cassette - 

				STEPHANIE(V.O.)
		I had it all on tape...

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

				JIM
		What did you do then?

				STEPHANIE
		I didn't know what to do - but I 
		knew I had something somebody
		would want.
			(gestures to Craig)
		That's where I met him - told him 
		what I had.  The FBI set me up with
		a new place...but the cops found me
		somehow.  So I ran...and met you.

				JIM
		What happened with the tape?

				STEPHANIE
		I took it with me.  It's in a safe
		place.

				JIM
			(to Craig)
		So you know about Marvosa, and 
		Stanton, and all of them.

				CRAIG
		Yes.  They were using the city
		resources to steal and fence luxury cars,
		then making sure the thefts weren't
		followed up.  It's a very lucrative
		business nowadays. 
  
 				JIM
		And you just did nothing?

				CRAIG
		At first I didn't know.
		We were waiting for the right
		time to act.  Fortunately 
		Stephanie had the good sense
		to do the right thing.
			(pulling out his gun)
		Unfortunately for you, I received
		a better offer.

				STEPHANIE
		What?

Craig turns and SHOOTS Tubbs at point blank range.  Then he spins and points the
gun on Jim.  Jim can barely restrain himself.

				CRAIG
		Like I said...it's a very
		lucrative business.

At that point, Marvosa emerges from behind them - carrying a MACHINE GUN - 

Jim looks ready to spring into action - waiting for the right moment - 

				CRAIG
		You want to make your best move?
		Go ahead...just give me a reason...

Jim says nothing.  Marvosa sneers.

				MARVOSA
		Before you try anything, you better
		look out the window.  Go ahead!

Jim looks out the window - 
										CUT TO

CONNOR,
DAVIS, EDGAR, and ULYSSES - 	

Jim then looks back at Craig, and Marvosa - 

				CRAIG
		Lets get our hands in the air, and
		let's move it.  And remember, I'm a
		jumpy kind of guy, so try not to
		make any sudden moves.

Jim and Stephanie put their hands up - 

				CRAIG
		Now you are going to come with us.  
		I know a smart girl like you made
		copies of that tape, and we're going 
		to find out what you did with each and
		every one of them.

Marvosa approaches Jim and Stephanie - he leers at Stephanie - 
				MARVOSA
		I'm gonna enjoy this - 

WHAM!! Marvosa SMASHES Jim in the chin with the butt of the gun - Jim staggers 
back

Marvosa PUNCHES Jim hard in the face - he WRENCHES the switchblade free - as he
lifts it up in the air - 

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!!  Marvosa is riddled in the back with bullets - 

by Stephanie, who lowers the gun - 

Jim shoves the body off of him - gets up and looks at Stephanie - 

Suddenly we hear the chamber of a .45 pull back - 

Jim and Stephanie look over - 

and see DOYLE, flanked by a team of armed SWAT officers - 

				DOYLE
		Drop it or we take you out right
		here - 

Stephanie listens - 

				DOYLE
		Alright c'mon out!  Hands in the
		air!

Jim and Stephanie comply - 

				STEPHANIE
		He was trying to kill us - it was -

				DOYLE
		I know I know - it was self defense.

Doyle approaches the two, looking hard at Jim, then looking at Stephanie - 

				DOYLE
		You must be Sarah...


				STEPHANIE
		Stephanie.

				DOYLE
			(Beat)
		Whatever...
			(Beat)
		Let's go...you got a lot
		of 'splaining to do...
				
										CUT TO
EXT ALLEYWAY - DAY

We see Stephanie's HAND pull a tape out of her purse.

Pull back to see Doyle -  

Stephanie hands the tape to Doyle - 

				STEPHANIE
		There's plenty more where this
		came from...here...

				DOYLE
		What is it?

				STEPHANIE
			(Beat)
		I don't want to ruin the surprise.

Doyle looks at her and puts the tape in his pocket - 

				DOYLE
		More surprises, that's all I need...
		I tell you, retirement's looking better
		everyday...

Doyle looks at Jim - 

				DOYLE
		Are you alright?  

				JIM
			(nods)
		I'll live...

Doyle looks at him, then laughs - 

				DOYLE
		I tell you one thing Trudell - 
		you'd make a hell of a cop...

				JIM
		It wasn't in the cards.

Jim and Doyle exchange looks of mutual respect - 

				DOYLE
		We better get going...

Camera tracks as Doyle leads Jim and Stephanie away - 

				JIM
		There's something I've been meaning
		to ask you, Stephanie.

				STEPHANIE
		Yeah.

				JIM
			(Beat)		
		Where the hell is my car?

Stephanie reluctantly answers - 

				STEPHANIE
		Have you ever heard of the Live 
		Oak River?

				JIM
		No - 

				STEPHANIE
		Neither did I.
			(Beat)
		I'll make it up to you, I
		promise...
		
Camera pulls back as Doyle, Jim and Stephanie head back to the car.




THE END
