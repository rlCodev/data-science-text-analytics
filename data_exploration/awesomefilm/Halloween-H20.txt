              FADE IN:
 
              EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SUBURBIA
 
              Langley, Illinois.  A quiet suburb located fifty miles
              outside of Chicago.
 
              SUPER the legend:  "Langley, Illinois.  October 28th 1998"
 
              A HOUSE
 
              nestled in the middle of a tree-lined street.  A Honda Civic
              pulls into a darkened driveway, the headlights are
              extinguished...
 
              PAMELA WHITTINGTON, a middle-aged woman in full registered
              nurse attire, emerges from the parked car.
 
              An unlit cigarette dangles loosely from her lips.  She heads
              to the porch, digging through her purse in search of a
              light...
 
              CRUNCH!
 
              Pamela stops in her tracks, looks down at her feet to discover
 
              GLASS
 
              scattered across the porch.  She looks at the porch light
              hanging above her head.
 
              A SHATTERED LIGHT BULB occupies the socket.
 
              Pamela turns her attention to the front door... it's slightly
              ajar.  She pushes on it gently.... the door swings open
              freely, revealing the darkened interior.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Shit...
 
              Pamela drops her purse... darts across some hedges into the
              neighbor's yard...
 
              EXT. THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
 
              Pamela runs up to the porch, decorated with carved
              pumpkins... POUNDS furiously on the front door, decorated
              with a CARDBOARD SKELETON.
 
              NO ANSWER.
 
              She POUNDS again... HARDER.  Suddenly, the door SWINGS open
              to reveal
 
              AN OMINOUS FIGURE
 
              looming in the doorway.  A HOCKEY MASK cloaks his face.

              A PAIR OF EYES
 
              glare at Pamela from behind the cut-outs in the plastic
              vizard.
 
              PAMELA
 
              gasps, stumbles backward.
 
              THE FIGURE
 
              flips up his mask to reveal
 
              JIMMY HOWELL
 
              a gangly teen, wearing a hockey jersey... skates slung over
              his shoulder.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
 
                                  PAMELA
                        My blood pleasure.  You scared the
                        hell out of me.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the
                        ring and --
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (interrupting)
                        I think someone broke into my
                        house.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        No shit?!
 
                                  PAMELA
                        No shit.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela sits on the couch taking hits off a lit cigarette.
              Jimmy paces the room, portable phone pressed against his ear.
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (into phone)
                        3037 Keystone.. yeah... gotcha.
 
              Jimmy hangs up the portable...

                                  JIMMY
                            (continuing)
                        Said to give 'em fifteen minutes.
                        They'll send someone by.
 
              Jimmy grabs his hockey stick, heads for the door.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Jimmy, what are you doing?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Checking out your place.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        No.  Wait for the police.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        And miss the big game?  No way.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela stands at the foot of her driveway... watches as Jimmy
              climbs the steps to her porch, hockey stick perched high on
              his shoulder.
 
              JIMMY
 
              moves toward the front door, stepping on pieces of shattered
              light bulb beneath him.
 
              He swings open the front door with the tip of his stick...
              looks inside the darkened house.
 
              He enters cautiously, stick at the ready.
 
              PAMELA
 
              lights up another cigarette, watches nervously as Jimmy
              disappears from view...
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Jimmy enters the dimmed foyer.
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (calling off)
                        Hey, man, don't mess with me!
                        I'll knock your head clean off
                        your body!
 
              He moves stealthily through the house, hockey stick poised
              high in the air... room-by-room he checks for intruders...

              Jimmy finds his way to the rear of the home, crosses to a
              back bedroom, stands in the doorway...
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (continuing)
                        Oh, shit...
 
              ON THE BEDROOM
 
              Converted to a home office... ransacked... file cabinets
              overturned, pictures hang crooked on the walls, papers carpet
              the floor...
 
              JIMMY
 
              drops the stick to his side, convinced he is now alone in the
              house.
 
              He crosses back into the kitchen... steals a cookie from a
              cookie jar... opens the fridge... takes a swig from an open
              milk carton... completely unaware that --
 
              THE BEDROOM CLOSET DOOR
 
              is opening slowly behind him, then suddenly --
 
              CRASH!
 
              An IRONING BOARD topples out from inside, slams against his
              back, hard.
 
              JIMMY
 
              snaps the hockey stick into position... spins around...
              swings wildly with the wooden baton.  He makes contact with...
 
              A POT RACK
 
              suspended above the island... pots dangling from their hooks
              come clanging down on top of him...
 
              The dust settles... Jimmy realizes he's been beating the
              stuffing out of an ironing board.  He sheepishly exits the
              kitchen...
 
              EXT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela stands at the foot of the driveway, trying to see in
              to the darkened house...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Come on, damn it...

              Jimmy emerges from the house... looks like Wayne Gretsky
              after slamming in his record goal.  He smiles at Pamela
              smugly...
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Nothing to fear.  The coast is
                        clear.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        You sure?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Totally.  I checked all the rooms
                        and closets...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Nothing's missing?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Don't think so.  But they sure did
                        a real number on your office.
                        Crap everywhere.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        My office?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your
                        kitchen pretty good, too...
                        Goodnight.
 
              Jimmy scurries off, avoiding any more questions.
 
              Pamela heads back to the house.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela enters the house, LOCKS AND BOLTS the front door
              behind her.  She breathes a heavy sigh of relief, back
              against the door... she flicks on a light switch... NOTHING.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Christ, Jimmy... didn't you try
                        the goddamn lights?!
 
              Pamela moves down the hallway to the laundry room... she
              opens the door to the FUSE BOX... toggles some fuses on and
              off... tries the laundry room light... still NOTHING,
              darkness.
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (continuing)
                        Shit.

              She grabs a flashlight out of the nearby cupboard, and
              proceeds down the hall to --
 
              INT. OFFICE
 
              The converted bedroom in complete disarray... Pamela
              navigates through the wreckage, carving a path with the beam
              of her flashlight.  She approaches --
 
              A DESK
 
              completely bare except for a single FILE FOLDER resting on
              its top.
 
              PAMELA
 
              shines the beam on the lone file folder.
 
              ON the folder... the index tab reads "KERI TATE."  Pamela
              opens the folder, it's EMPTY.
 
              PAMELA
 
              gasps, the blood rushes from her face.  She immediately
              rushes for the phone.
 
              CLANK!
 
              A noise is heard.  She's not alone in this house.  She moves
              through the hallway to discover the front door wide open.
              Shit.  She bolts.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela runs out the door and back to Jimmy's house.  She
              opens the front door, disappears inside.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela shuts the door behind her... cranes her neck,
              searching for any signs of Jimmy --
 
              She HEARS the sounds of a television emanating from deep
              within the house.
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (calling off)
                        Jimmy!  You still there?!
 
              CAMERA FOLLOWS Pamela as she makes her way from one darkened
              room to the next... she crosses into the den to discover

              JIMMY
 
              seated in an easy-chair, watching an episode of "SEINFELD."
              his back to Pamela... only his legs are visible from her
              point-of-view.
 
              Pamela approaches him --
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Goddamnit, Jimmy!  Someone's still
                        in my house!
 
              Pamela spins the easy-chair around to reveal --
 
              A HOCKEY SKATE
 
              embedded deep into Jimmy's face... the blade slicing through
              flesh, from forehead to chin... eyes wide open in terror...
              blood cascades down his jersey...
 
              PAMELA
 
              screams... bolts through the house, reaches the front door to
              find --
 
              A CHINA CABINET
 
              pushed in front of it, blocks her way!  She tries fiercely to
              move the wooden hutch, but can't...
 
              Pamela runs back through the house, frantic... in desperate
              search of an exit.
 
              She crosses into the kitchen, spots her escape... moves to
              the rear door, opens it to reveal...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing, poised, evil eyes burning through slits in his
              trademark mask.
 
              PAMELA
 
              shrieks... grabs a knife out of a nearby butcher block...
              heads back to the living room.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              moves after her, the hunt is on...
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              FLASHING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS

              illuminate the room...
 
              PAMELA
 
              runs to a window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
 
              A squad car arrives in front of Pamela's house.  Two
              UNIFORMED COPS emerge from the vehicle, head up her driveway.
 
              PAMELA
 
              Struggles to open the window... she can't manage to disengage
              the lock... she pounds feverishly on the glass --
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (yelling)
                        HELP!  GODDAMNIT IT!  OVER HERE!
                        GOD PLEASE!
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind her... grabs an IRON POKER from a group of
              fireplace utensils.
 
              PAMELA
 
              spins around, swings at the Shape with the knife...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Stay the fuck away from me!
 
              The Shape swings the iron poker... delivers a severe blow to
              Pamela's arm... breaks it... the knife falls to the floor
              below.
 
              Pamela howls in pain... drops to her knees, nurses her arm...
 
              The Shape raises the poker high into the air, comes down
              hard... drives the tip of the poker through her skull...
              CRACK!
 
              EXT. PAMELA'S FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME
 
              In the f.g. two cops climb the porch steps and move into the
              house.
 
              In the b.g. we can see the Shape through the neighboring
              window as he repeatedly stabs Pamela with the poker.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
 
              CLOSE ON A PLAQUE
 
              "HILLCREST ACADEMY.  ESTABLISHED 1874"
 
              THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a co-ed boarding school...
              set behind massive wrought-iron gates on acreage in a
              secluded region of Wisconsin.
 
              SUPER the legend:  "Ferndale, Wisconsin.  October 29th 1998."
 
              The academy's gothic architecture and rich history can be
              seen throughout the entire campus, consisting of a cluster of
              buildings:  the school, the dorms, a gymnasium with indoor
              swimming pool, a bell tower, a guard house and --
 
              A GROUP OF FACULTY HOUSES
 
              litters the far end of the campus.
 
              CLOSE ON a kitchen window.  Inside KERI TATE, mid-thirties,
              stands behind a sink washing dishes.
 
              On closer inspection, we see that this face is none other
              that LAURIE STRODE.

              Keri stands with her back to JOHN, 16, chiseled good looks.
              He stands behind her in the doorway... They are in mid-
              conversation --
 
                                  KERI
                        Nothing's changed since yesterday,
                        or last week, or last month... the
                        answer's still "no."
 
                                  JOHN
                        You're so predictable.
 
              Keri grabs the sprayer, squirts John from across the room.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (continuing)
                        What the --
 
                                  KERI
                        Betcha' didn't predict that.
 
              Keri throws John a dishtowel... he dabs at his shirt.

                                  JOHN
                        I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be
                        able to live wherever I want.
 
                                  KERI
                        And I should have a son who calls
                        me "Mom".  Looks like we're both
                        shit out of luck.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom.
                        Now can I move into the dorms?
 
                                  KERI
                        No.
 
              Keri hands John a stack of clean dishes.  John doesn't
              budge...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
 
                                  KERI
                        You're father thinks it's okay to
                        run off to Cancun with a blonde
                        bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow
                        his opinion doesn't count.
 
                                  JOHN
                        I promise not to run off to Cancun.
 
                                  KERI
                        Forget it.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (pointing out the
                             kitchen window)
                        The dorms are only fifty feet
                        away.  You could practically see
                        into my window.  So, what
                        difference does it make?
 
                                  KERI
                        My point exactly.  See, we both
                        agree.
 
              Keri takes the dishes back from John, puts them away in an
              overhead cupboard.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Alright, I was wrong.  There is a
                        big difference between rooming
                        with your buddies and living with
                        your mother and school headmaster.

                                  KERI
                        I took the padlock off your door.
                        What more do you want?
 
                                  JOHN
                        My life is a living hell.
 
              Keri raises an eyebrow...
 
                                  KERI
                        It's not, trust me.
 
              John gives up, heads out of the room...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Where are you going?
 
                                  JOHN
                        To the bathroom.  Can I do that
                        alone or do you want to watch?
 
                                  KERI
                        I thought you'd never ask.
 
              Keri puts her arms around John, escorts him out of the
              kitchen...
 
                                  JOHN
                        You're twisted.
 
                                  KERI
                        I know.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - DAY
 
              Keri moves across campus toward the school, a leather
              briefcase slung over one shoulder.
 
              Passing STUDENTS ad-lib "Hellos," their admiration for Keri
              made evident by their favorable rapport with her.
 
              Keri passes in front of --
 
              A ROW OF SCHOOL BUSES
 
              parked alongside the school.  An older bus on the far end
              sits empty, hood up.
 
              WALLY BECKETTE, a rather portly man in his early sixties, and
              the school custodian, fiddles with the exposed engine.

                                  KERI
                        Wally, you've been under that hood
                        for months.  Why don't we just
                        call a mechanic?
 
              Wally stops what he is doing... comes out from beneath the
              hood... wipes his hands on his pants.
 
                                  WALLY
                        Miss Tate, I serviced B-1 Bombers
                        in W-W-2.  This here is child's
                        play.
 
                                  KERI
                        So you're saying I should call a
                        child to come give you a hand?
 
              Wally chuckles softly, charmed by Keri like the rest of the
              staff.
 
                                  WALLY
                        I'm saying she'll be purring like
                        a kitten before you know it.
 
                                  KERI
                        There's your problem, Walter.  You
                        don't want it to purr, you want it
                        to start.
 
                                  WALLY
                        And she will, Miss Tate.  She will.
 
              Keri continues toward the school.  Wally watches with
              admiration as she heads into the building...
 
                                  WALLY
                            (continuing)
                        Mmmm-mmm.  If they had teachers
                        like you when I was a boy, I'd be
                        a rocket scientist.
 
              Wally goes back to tinkering with the engine...
 
              ON HATTIE SMITH, mid-sixties, dressed in a guard uniform...
              approaches Keri, looking very official... holds a key in her
              hand.
 
                                  KERI
                        Good morning, Hattie.
 
                                  HATTIE
                        Went into town.  Had that
                        duplicate key made.

              Hattie hands Keri the key.
 
                                  KERI
                        Thank you.
 
              Hattie extends an open hand.
 
                                  HATTIE
                        Thank me with two bucks.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh... right.
 
              Keri digs through her pocket, produces a handful of change...
              gives it to Hattie.
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (dripping sarcasm)
                        Just what I wanted... more change.
 
              Hattie heads back toward the guard house, turns back to
              Keri --
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (continuing)
                        And next time you lose a gate key,
                        young lady, you'll be climbing
                        your way out of here.
 
              Keri holds the key to her chest.
 
                                  KERI
                        I'll be more careful next time.
 
              Hattie dismisses Keri with a wave of her hand, continues
              across campus to the guard house.
 
              Keri smiles, places the key in her pocket and disappears
              inside the school...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
 
              Pouring rain.  In stark contrast to the sunny campus of
              Hillcrest...
 
              EMERGENCY VEHICLES litter the landscape, lights FLASHING.
 
              OFFICERS wrap yellow crime scene tape around the perimeter,
              keeping curious NEIGHBORS at bay...

              RICHARD CARTER
 
              a middle-aged police detective, eyes bloodshot from too
              little sleep and one too many hours in front of a computer
              screen, emerges from a dark Sedan... a lit cigarette dangles
              loosely from his lips.
 
              Carter approaches a young OFFICER standing outside the front
              door --
 
                                  CARTER
                            (flashes his badge)
                        Detective Richard Carter,
                        Haddonfield P.D.  Detective Blake
                        called my office...
 
              The Officer motions to the door --
 
                                  OFFICER
                        Go on in.  She's been waiting for
                        you.
 
              Carter heads towards the door, the Officer grabs his arm...
 
                                  OFFICER
                            (continuing)
                        You might need this...
 
              The Officer offers him a small jar of petroleum jelly.
              Carter waves it away.
 
                                  OFFICER
                            (continuing)
                        Some serious shit in there,
                        Detective.
 
              Carter reconsiders, smears the Vaseline under each nostril...
              heads for the house.
 
              INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE
 
              Carter crosses through the front door, watches as
 
              A TEAM of latex-gloved FORENSIC SPECIALISTS
 
              dust door and windows for fingerprints, swab at blood drops,
              and collect carpet fibers for later analysis...
 
              Carter crosses into the living room, winces at

              PAMELA WHITTINGTON
 
              sprawled across the floor in front of blood-soaked
              curtains... the wrought-iron poker jammed up her nose, exits
              through the top of her skull... a kitchen knife lies beside
              her...
 
              Carter takes another hit off the cigarette, blows smoke into
              the room...
 
                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                        Double homicide.
 
              Carter turns to see
 
              TONI BLAKE
 
              standing behind him... mid-twenties, attractive yet
              approachable...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Her name's Pamela Whittington,
                        next door neighbor to victim
                        number two... James Howell.
 
              Carter motions in the direction of the den where
 
              A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER
 
              takes snapshots of the teenage corpse.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Let me guess... he's the guy with
                        the hockey skate for a nose ring.
 
              BLAKE
 
              crosses to Carter, extends a dixie cup in his direction --
 
                                  CARTER
                        No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        It's for your cigarette.  I prefer
                        not to contaminate my crime scene
                        with micropollutants.
 
              Carter takes a final puff off the cigarette, drops it into
              the cup...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Why am I here?

                                  BLAKE
                        They said on the phone you were
                        assigned to the Meyers case.
 
                                  CARTER
                        With all due respect, detective,
                        you can't go blaming every brutal
                        murder in Illinois on Michael
                        Meyers.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Pamela Whittington was a long time
                        associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home
                        office was ransacked.  It was
                        chock full of Loomis' files on
                        Meyers.  It'd say that makes
                        Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
 
                                  CARTER
                        Well, when you put it that way.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Right.  So why don't we get on
                        with this investigation?
 
                                  CARTER
                        I like a woman who takes control.
 
              Blake ignores the comment, crosses to the front door...
              Carter follows.
 
              During the following dialogue, Blake walks Carter through the
              crime scene reenacting the prior evening's brutal events...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Pamela entered the house and
                        walked into the den where she
                        discovers James Howell's body...
 
              Carter and Blake stand in front of the mutilated face of the
              teenage boy...
 
                                  BLAKE
                            (continuing)
                        Shaken, she returns to the front
                        door to find the hutch blocking
                        her exit...
 
              ON gouges across the wood planks, forming tracks from the
              dining room to the front door...

                                  BLAKE
                            (continuing)
                        She runs to the kitchen, where she
                        is ambushed at the back door by
                        the killer.
 
              Carter and Blake stand in front of the door, which is still
              open.  Carter kneels down, looks at the kitchen floor...
 
                                  CARTER
                        One set of muddy shoe prints.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        That don't match either of the
                        victim's.
 
              Carter stands up, moves to a butcher block on the counter...
              he's starting to enjoy this dance --
 
                                  CARTER
                        She grabs a knife from the butcher
                        block.
 
              ON the butcher block, an empty slot where the knife once
              resided...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Heads to the living room...
 
              They cross back into the living room...
 
              Carter moves to the
 
              WINDOW
 
              covered in fingerprint powder, exposing a plethora of prints.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Where, judging by the looks of the
                        finger and palm prints, she
                        struggles to open the window
                        before banging on it like hell.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Unable to escape, she turns and
                        attacks the killer, but doesn't
                        connect.
 
                                  CARTER
                        No blood on the knife.
 
              ON the knife, clean as a whistle...

                                  CARTER
                            (continuing)
                        The killer knocks the knife out of
                        her hand with the wrought-iron
                        poker.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Broken blood vessels on her right
                        forearm.
 
              ON Pamela's arm, a bruise forming under the skin...
 
                                  CARTER
                        As which point she drops to her
                        knees in pain...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Explaining the low height of the
                        blood splatter on the curtains...
 
              ON the curtains, blood stained four feet and below...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you
                        learn how to do that?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Girl scouts.
 
              Carter chuckles... she has a sense of humor, too...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
 
              A BELL RINGS.
 
              The hallway is flooded with STUDENTS, books in tow...
 
              ON MOLLY CARTWRIGHT
 
              a young seventeen, friendly eyes and a face to match.
 
              Walking beside her is...
 
              LINDA KANG, same age, unconcerned, full of spunk... multiple
              body piercings, doesn't quite fit in here or anywhere...
 
                                  LINDA
                        You aced it, didn't you?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I did alright.

              Linda grabs Molly's test, peeking out from her biology book...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Fuckin' A.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
 
              Linda punches Molly playfully in the arm.  They stop at
              neighboring lockers, retrieve books from inside...
 
              AMY KRAMER approaches, book pressed against an ample chest,
              smacking on a wad of gum...
 
              Eye-catching good looks, a real stunner... a bit short on the
              gray matter though --
 
                                  AMY
                        These lockers are totally girl
                        unfriendly.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Break another nail?
 
                                  AMY
                        Pointer finger.  And the dance is
                        in two days...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Life's a bitch.
 
              The girls head down the hall...
 
                                  AMY
                        Eddie's working late at Freeman's
                        tonight... all alone.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I thought Eddie left for N.Y.U.?
 
                                  AMY
                        Guess he couldn't tear himself
                        away from me.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Guess he couldn't pass admissions.
 
                                  AMY
                        Shut up, pinhead.
 
              John approaches them from behind, drapes his arms around
              Molly...

                                  JOHN
                        There you are.
                            (to Amy)
                        You tell 'em about tonight?
 
                                  AMY
                        I just got here.
 
              John removes a key from his jacket pocket, drops it in
              Molly's hand...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        What's this?
 
                                  LINDA
                        You say, "The key to my heart,"
                        and I'm gonna hurl.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key
                        to the main gate.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Where'd you get it?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Swiped it from my mom's desk
                        yesterday.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You stole it?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I borrowed it.
 
                                  AMY
                        Party at Freeman's tonight.
 
                                  LINDA
                        I am in need of some serious
                        partying.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Not me.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Why not?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I can't afford to get caught.

                                  LINDA
                        Molly, you're the resident
                        assistant.  What are you gonna do,
                        narc on yourself?
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Students clear the hall, move inside their classrooms.
 
              John kisses Molly on the lips...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Just meet me in front of the gate
                        after lights out.
 
              He takes off down the hall --
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (calling after him)
                        Wait... John...
 
              He's gone.  A teacher guides the girls inside a classroom and
              shuts the door...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON
 
              A bevy of STUDENTS scurry about the gym making final
              preparations for the impending Halloween Festivals:  hanging
              decorations on walls, carving pumpkins, spinning cob webs
              along refreshment tables...
 
              ON WILL BRENNEN, a well-favored Chemistry teacher in his mid-
              forties, thinning hair, more salt than pepper... supervises
              the action... a coffee mug in hand... his attention focused
              on...
 
              KERI
 
              sitting atop the bleachers.  Will climbs the benches, sits
              beside her...
 
                                  WILL
                        What a sight for sore eyes...
 
              He kisses her softly on the lips.
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        ... and ears...
 
              He kisses her again.

                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        ...and lips...
 
              He engages her in a lingering kiss.
 
              A GROUP OF STUDENTS
 
              point and giggle at the smooching faculty members.
 
              Keri notices, pulls away...
 
                                  KERI
                        Will...
 
              She motions toward the students below.
 
                                  WILL
                        What?  They've all taken sex ed.
 
              He leans in for another kiss, she playfully keeps him at arms
              length...
 
                                  KERI
                        And this isn't the place for a
                        live demonstration.
 
              Will relents, settles for holding Keri's hand...
 
                                  WILL
                        Aren't they doing a terrific job
                        this year?
 
                                  KERI
                            (distracted)
                        Looks great.  It does.
 
                                  WILL
                        You okay?  You seem a little off.
 
                                  KERI
                        Nothing a good stiff drink can't
                        fix.
 
              Will doesn't find the humor, eyes her uneasily.
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        That one always goes over big at
                        the AA meetings.
 
              An awkward beat, then...

                                  WILL
                        It's John, isn't it?
 
                                  KERI
                        It's always John.
 
                                  WILL
                        Still wants to move out?
 
                                  KERI
                        He's been living out of moving
                        boxes for three months.
 
                                  WILL
                        This kid just wants his freedom.
 
                                  KERI
                        It's not going to happen.
 
                                  WILL
                        The tighter you squeeze, the
                        harder he'll try to break free.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, please... you get that out of
                        a fortune cookie?
 
                                  WILL
                        Doesn't make it bad advice.
 
              Keri manages a smile...
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        God I love that smile.
 
              Keri stands.  Will follows suit.

                        I'm going into town... run a few
                        errands before dark.  Need
                        anything?
 
                                  WILL
                        A box of fortune cookies... I'm
                        running out of advice.
 
                                  KERI
                        Bye Will.
 
              Keri heads down the bleachers.  Will watches her leave,
              completely enamored...

              INT. NIELSEN'S MARKET - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              A family-owned grocery mart in the heart of Ferndale.  A half-
              dozen CUSTOMERS mingle through the aisles.
 
              ON Keri, standing in front of a CASHIER as he rings up a
              dozen items...
 
              Keri glances at the wall of tabloids in front of her, one of
              them catches her eye --
 
              CLOSE ON: THE GLOBE
 
              A headline reads: "SERIAL KILLER MICHAEL MEYERS REALLY ALIEN
              FROM OUTER SPACE."  Beneath the headline is a mock photo of
              the Shape, holding the infamous mask in his hand, revealing
              an alien head underneath....
 
              Keri can't help but smirk at the absurdity of it all.  The
              cashier hands Keri her change...
 
                                  CASHIER
                        Happy Halloween.
 
              Keri manages a polite smile, and exits...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. NIELSEN'S MARKET - MINUTES LATER
 
              Keri moves down the tree-lined street, groceries tucked
              securely under her arm.
 
              She pauses at a storefront window.  "KESSLER JEWELERS.  EST.
              1963" emblazoned across the glass.
 
              ANGLE ON WINDOW
 
              An assortment of wedding rings glimmer behind the glass.
 
              KERI
 
              holds her left hand up to the window, moving it slowly from
              ring to ring... then she sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              in the reflection... standing across the street, staring
              right through her... taunting her.  This is no alien...
 
              KERI'S
 
              heart stops... she stands frozen, totally immobile.

              A TRUCK
 
              passes between them.
 
              KERI
 
              takes this opportunity to spin around.  The truck passes --
 
              THE SHAPE HAS VANISHED.
 
                                  KERI
                        I hate this fucking holiday...
 
              Keri climbs into the driver's seat of her Ford Explorer,
              tosses the bag of groceries on the passenger seat...
 
              She starts the engine...
 
              "MR. SANDMAN" blares over the radio... scares the shit out of
              her.  Keri quickly changes stations... heads back to the
              school.

              INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
 
              Sparsely decorated.  Scattered Chinese food containers litter
              the counters.
 
              On a glass dining room table, a table dozen cardboard boxes,
              "DR. LOOMIS" in black sharpie scrawled across their sides.
 
              The CAMERA PANS across the table where...
 
              CARTER
 
              sits, eyes glazed over... shuffling through a stack of
              photographs.
 
              ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS
 
              Of a young Michael Meyers playing with a fire truck in the
              den... running through sprinklers in the backyard... riding
              horses at the county fair... no signs of the evil lurking
              inside.
 
              CARTER sets the photographs aside, digs through a file box...
              pulls out a film canister marked "MEYERS' HOME MOVIES."
 
              ON A PROJECTOR
 
              CARTER threads the Super 8 film through it, turns it on...
              images of a young Michael Meyers are projected on a bare wall
              in the darkened room.

              CARTER settles into the recliner, fights to stay awake...
 
              THE SHAPE APPEARS IN FRONT OF THE WALL.
 
              The home movies projected on his pale mask.  He moves slowly
              toward the sleeping CARTER, a knife in his grip.
 
              The SHAPE raises the knife to CARTER's throat, slices it from
              ear to ear.  CARTER grabs his throat, blood gushes through
              his fingers.  Then...
 
              THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
 
              CARTER WAKES UP.
 
              Gasps for air... he feels for his throat... no blood, all is
              well.
 
              The Super 8 films slaps against the projector, the reel now
              over...
 
              CARTER catches his breath... surveys the room... he is alone.
              He picks up the phone --
 
                                  CARTER
                            (into phone)

                        It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Where?
 
                                  BLAKE

                        Yeah, alright... I'll be there in
                        ten.
 
              Carter hangs up the phone, massages his throat...

              CLOSE ON THE PALE WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK
 
              CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a mannequin sporting the mask and
              dark overalls made notorious by Michael Meyers... its arm
              posed high in the air, wielding a meat cleaver.
 
              Gathered around the mannequin is the gang:

              Linda is in the arms of her boyfriend, SHANE McCLOUD... a
              tall and spindly teen, book smart and street dumb...
 
              John riffles through a rack of Halloween costumes.  Molly
              leans against a nearby counter... she checks her watch,
              visibly uncomfortable being here at all.
 
              EDDIE CATERO, two years out of high school and still wearing
              his letterman jacket, 'Nuff said.
 
              He stands proudly by his display, nursing a beer... his arm
              draped around Amy, who's painting her nails with a nail
              polish plucked from a nearby display...
 
                                  EDDIE
                            (re: the display)
                        Pretty wicked, huh?
 
                                  LINDA
                        I think it's twisted.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        This coming from the girl with a
                        stake through her tongue.
 
                                  LINDA
                        You're glorifying the big creep.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Besides, it's historically
                        inaccurate.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        What the fuck are you talking
                        about?
 
                                  SHANE
                        Michael Meyers never used a meat
                        cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Who are you, the serial killer
                        police?  What difference does it
                        make?
 
                                  SHANE
                        It's not historically accurate,
                        that's all.
 
                                  AMY
                        He could be holding a swizzle
                        stick, it still gives me the

                                  JOHN
                        Don't worry... I hear he only
                        kills virgins.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Another historical inaccuracy.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Would somebody shut this guy up?

                        move.  I'll be right back.

              Eddie moves toward the front of the store, heads down the

              Eddie rounds the corner, runs smack into --

              arm poised high in the air, knife missing.
 
              Eddie turns around to see --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing right behind him, wielding the meat cleaver.

                        around.
 
              Still nothing... Amy cautiously moves into the store, looking
              for her missing partner... she passes

              sprawled on the floor, the meat cleaver buried in the middle

              Amy SCREAMS... can barely stand... she stumbles to the front
              of the door... it's locked!

              The Michael Meyers mannequin behind her comes to life, begins
              to move toward her...
 
              Amy beats frantically on the glass door, struggling to free
              the lock... she turns to see...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              closing in behind her... she SCREAMS.
 
              The SHAPE attacks, grabs Amy by the back of the neck...
              pushes her face through the glass door, cuts it to bits...
 
              He lifts Amy high into the air, she struggles to free
              herself... the Shape impales her body on a large shard of
              glass.
 
              ON Amy's feet... dangling a foot off the ground... then...
 
              Her body goes completely limp... lifeless.

              EXT. GRAND VIEW CEMETERY - NIGHT
 
              A well manicured graveyard... lush green lawns, thriving oak
              trees, and patches of blooming flowers...
 
              FRED WILLIAMS, an elderly caretaker, leads Carter and Blake
              through the darkened cemetery... a flashlight illuminating
              their path.
 
                                  CARTER
                        You take all your dates here.
                        Blake?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Only the real stiffs.
 
                                  CARTER
                        I can be real stiff.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Charming.
 
                                  FRED
                        Hey!  Watch my geraniums.

              Carter looks down at his feet, finds himself standing in the
              middle of a group of flowers... he quickly hops back onto the
              grass...
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Beautiful, aren't they?  Rotting
                        corpses make the best fertilizer,
                        ya' know.  Especially those Irish
                        folk.  They push up the daises
                        like a son-of-a-bitch...
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'll remember that.
 
                                  FRED
                        Hell, I can tell you where every
                        Mick is buried by the ground cover
                        growing above 'em.
 
              Fred shines his flashlight on a distant grave.
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Irish...
                            (shining the beam on
                             another grave)
                        ...Irish...
 
              They stop in front of a gravesite... TOMBSTONE missing...
              patchy grass covers the grave.
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Never could get anything to grow
                        cover this one...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        And you're sure this is Laurie
                        Strode's grave?
 
                                  FRED
                        Sure as I'm standing here.
 
              Fred shines the beam of the flashlight on an adjacent
              headstone...
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Buried her daughter right next to
                        her not too long ago.  You don't
                        suppose that Meyers fella took the
                        tombstone?

                                  CARTER
                        Probably just a couple of kids
                        playing a Halloween prank.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Tee-peeing a house, yes.  A bag of
                        burning shit on a porch, maybe.
                        Digging up tombstone?  I don't
                        think so.
 
              Carter shrugs his shoulders, take a drag off his cigarette.
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'm going to bed.
 
              Carter heads back to his car.  Blake runs after him...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        That's it?
 
                                  CARTER
                        Care to join me?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Come on, Carter.  You know it's
                        Michael.
 
                                  CARTER
                        What do you want me to do, put out
                        an A.P.B. on a man in overalls
                        wearing a white mask dragging a
                        headstone?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Yes.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Sweet dreams, Blake.
 
              Carter climbs into his car, heads for home...

              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              Keri tosses and turns in her bed, unable to exorcise the
              demons from her mind... eyes wide open, watches the moonlight
              cast the shadows of dancing leaves on the ceiling above her...
 
              Then, the shadow of something altogether unnatural appears
              above her...
 
              THE SHADOW OF A MAN
 
              hair tattered and tousled by the wind.
 
              ON Keri lying frozen in fear, eyes unblinking.

              THE SILHOUETTE
 
              grows larger, nearly engulfs the entire ceiling... then
              suddenly disappears from view... the dancing leaves return.
 
              CLANK!
 
              A noise from outside her window.  FOOTSTEPS quickly make
              their way around the house...
 
              Keri jumps out of her skin, holds her breath...
 
              A JIGGLING SOUND emanates from the living room, as if
              someone's trying to get in through the front door...
 
              Keri jumps out of her bed, slides a metal box out from under
              the bed... pulls a SMITH AND WESSON from inside... heads
              for --
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Keri moves silently through the hallway into the living room,
              gun at the ready... hands trembling... eyes locked on the
              front door as --
 
              THE DOORKNOB
 
              slowly twists and turns... the SHADOW of a man behind the
              curtain of the window flanking the side of the door.
 
              KERI
 
              raises the gun... uses both hands to steady her aim... her
              breathing becoming more shallow with each passing second...
 
              THE DOOR
 
              swings open revealing...
 
              JOHN
 
              house key in hand... busted.
 
              KERI
 
              lowers the gun, fights back in tears...
 
              John closes the door... if he's surprised that his mother's
              pointing a gun in his face, he doesn't show it...
 
                                  KERI
                        Shit, John!  What the hell were
                        you doing out there?!

                                  JOHN
                        Nothing.
 
                                  KERI
                        You're kidding with that answer,
                        right?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I just went for a walk.  It's no
                        big deal.
 
                                  KERI
                        Wrong.  There are rules in this
                        house and you're going to follow
                        them whether you like it or not.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
 
                                  KERI
                        It's an option.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Well, maybe if you'd let me live
                        in the dorms, I wouldn't have to
                        sneak out to spend time with my
                        friends.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, so now it's my fault?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Just forget it...
 
              John storms down the hall, disappears into his bedroom...
              slams the door behind him.

              Keri enters the room, passes by the window... glances out
              into the night and sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing between sheets that blow in the clothesline.
 
              KERI
 
              closes her eyes, takes a deep breath... opens them... now
              both the Shape and the sheets blowing in the clothesline have
              VANISHED.

              Keri substituting for the absentee English Lit teacher.  Mr.
              Elliot.
 
              A STUDENT has just finished her oral report and heads back to
              her seat.
 
              Keri stands, crosses to the chalkboard --
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm sure Mr. Elliot will go over
                        this when he returns on Monday,
                        but Julie hit on a very important
                        aspect of Virgil's "The Aeniad."
 
              She scrawls the word "FATE" across its surface...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        F-A-T-E.  Fate.  The Romans
                        believed in the three goddesses of
                        Fate, called "the Fate."  Nona,
                        Decuma, and Morta.  These
                        goddesses determined your fate.
                        They were to blame when things
                        went wrong, and were to be praised
                        when --
 
              Keri passes in front of the classroom, glances out the window
              and sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing behind the gates of the academy, waiting patiently
              for his chance... eyes burning a hold right through her.
 
              THE STUDENTS
 
              wait for Keri to complete her thought... mumble softly
              amongst themselves...
 
              KERI
 
              closes her eyes for a moment, takes a deep breath... looks
              outside again... the Shape is STILL THERE!
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              The students make a mad dash for the hall.

              KERI
 
              moves swiftly through the throng of students, pushing
              bewildered pupils aside as she makes her way to the school
              entrance...

              Keri emerges from the building, moves across the campus
              toward the iron gates... runs smack into --
 
              WILL
 
              throws his arms around her waist...
 
                                  WILL
                        Whoa... what's the hurry?  I'm not
                        going anywhere...
 
              Keri doesn't respond, is too busy looking over Will's
              shoulder --
 
              KERI'S POV of the gate... the SHAPE has once again
              disappeared.
 
              Keri eyes the perimeter of the campus, searching for her long
              lost brother.
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        Hey, you alright?

                            (distracted)
                        What?
 
                                  WILL
                        What are you looking at?
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm fine.  I just need to lie
                        down...
 
              Keri breaks free from Will's grip, heads toward the faculty
              housing, determined.  Will watches her leave, face laced with
              concern...

              Keri climbs atop a foot stool, retrieves a BOTTLE of Vodka
              concealed behind bags of flour on the top shelf of the
              pantry...
 
              She spins off the top... brings the lip of the bottle to her
              mouth, hands trembling...
 
              She stops short of taking the drink, bring the bottle down
              from her lips...
 
              Keri climbs off the foot stool, crosses to the kitchen sink
              and pours the Vodka down the drain...

              Blake sits behind her desk leafing through the double
              homicide case file, looking for some stone that's been left
              unturned...
 
              She removes a FILE FOLDER from an evidence bag, "KERI TATE"
              in type across the index tape...
 
              Blake opens it... still empty.
 
              ON THE FILE FOLDER.
 
              The light from her desk lamp falls across the open folder,
              reveals a series of indentations in the left hand corner of
              the manilla paper...
 
              BLAKE
 
              struggles to make out the ghost writing... grabs a pencil,
              moves the side of the lead swiftly across the folder...
 
              "6089244325"
 
              The numbers pop out against the shaded background...
 
              BLAKE
 
              jots the numbers down on a nearby pad.
 
              ON THE PAD
 
              Blake tries formatting the numbers into a Social Security
              number: "608-92-44325" too many numbers.  She scratches it

              A compact CAR pulls up behind the gates, high beams
              illuminating the...
 
              GUARD HOUSE
 
              There is an entrance on either side of the guard house...
              inside sits Hattie.
 
              She cups her hands over her eyes, protecting them from the
              glare of the auto's headlights.  She checks --
 
              A MONITOR
 
              embedded in the console in front of her... black and white
              image of the car idling outside the gates illuminates the
              screen.
 
              ON Hattie, unable to make out the identity of the driver.
              She steps out of the guard house...
 
              EXT. GATES
 
              Through the gate, she sees a figure slumped behind the
              wheel...
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (calling off)
                        Who's there?
 
              No response.

                        man.
 
              Still nothing.  Hattie doesn't know what to do.
 
              She opens the gate with her gate key and walks through... she
              approaches the car.  The trees rustle nearby.  She takes a
              look, spooking herself.  It is, after all, Halloween.

              She crosses to the driver's side window... looks inside to
              find the body of --

              Hattie stumbles backward... she's doesn't see THE SHAPE pass
              through the open gates behind her.
 
              She crosses back to the --
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Hattie quickly presses a BUTTON on the console in front of
              her, automatically closing the wrought iron gates outside...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              stands at the entrance to the left of guard house.  Hattie's
              back to him.
 
              She picks up the phone... no dial tone.  She jiggles the
              receiver... comes up short.
 
              CLINK.  A noise from outside.
 
              Hattie spins around, faces the left entrance... no one in
              sight.
 
                                  HATTIE

              No answer.  Hattie crosses to the left entrance, shuts the
              door... throws the bolt.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind Hattie... now standing at the entrance to the
              right of the guard house.
 
              CLINK.  Another noise, source unknown...
 
              Hattie spins around, faces the right entrance... the Shape
              has vanished.
 
              Hattie crosses to the right entrance, shuts the door... locks
              it.  Now secured safely inside the guard house, Hattie
              crosses to a CB Radio...

              She turns it on... dials the emergency channel... is
              distracted by --

              emerges from the shadows behind her... wraps the CB cord
              around her neck... Hattie struggles to free herself... her
              face pressed up against the glass...
 
              The Shape brandishes a knife... stabs her repeatedly in the
              back... ends the struggle.

              the rope dangling from the bell...
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Its sound resonating across the campus.
 
              ON THE DORMS.
 
              The windows, once lit, are now extinguished, leaving the
              dorms shrouded in total darkness... lights out.

              The sound of the ringing bell echoes softly through the

              Molly lies in her bed, unable to sleep, eyes to the
              ceiling... her pajama clad body partially covered by a sheet.
 
              ON "LURCH," THE SCHOOL DOG
 
              lying beside Molly's bed, also asleep.
 
              Molly hears the RUSTLING of bushes outside her window... she
              turns in its direction to see --

              THE BUSHES
 
              moving forcefully, their branches scratching wildly against
              glass...
 
              MOLLY
 
              sits up in bed, her eyes glued to the window... she slowly
              gets out of bed, moves toward it... leans against the
              windowpane.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              of the campus, bathed in moonlight... wind howls through the

              BANG!  BANG!
 
              A hand raps on her window.  Molly jumps out of her skin.
 
              ON JOHN
 
              standing outside her window, motions her to open it.  She
              does, sticks her head out...

                        Why?

                        Then you come out here.

                                  MOLLY
                        Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be
                        quiet.

              Molly and John meander through the wooded acreage along the
              perimeter of the campus, hand-in-hand... the school buildings
              completely obfuscated by the surrounding foliage.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You really think Eddie killed her?
 
                                  JOHN
                        You saw that Michael Meyers
                        display.  You've got to be pretty
                        twisted to come up with something
                        like that.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I guess.  It's just hard to
                        believe.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind them in the distance, standing beside a
              tree... watching... waiting.  It seems as though with each
              cut the SHAPE moves closer...
 
                                  JOHN
                        You look kind of cold.

                        I'm okay.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Here, take my jacket.
 
              John takes off his letterman jacket, drapes it over her
              shoulders...
 
              The SHAPE disappears from view, into the thicket.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (continuing)
                        Better?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Yeah.

              John gazes into Molly's eyes, her moves in closer... they
              engage in a passionate kiss... John's hands begin to find
              there way up her blouse when --
 
              A PAIR OF HANDS
 
              grabs them by the back of their necks, pulls them to their
              feet!  Shit!  Molly SCREAMS... the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO
              REVEAL...
 
              KERI
 
              with a firm grip on them both, a disapproving look painted
              across her face.
 
                                  KERI
                        All right... fun's over.
 
              EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - MINUTES LATER
 
              Keri moves across the campus, back to the school... Molly and
              John in tow.  They pass the group of faculty houses...
 
                                  KERI
                            (to John)
                        Go take a cold shower... I'll deal
                        with you later.
 
              John heads for his house, waves good-bye to Molly... she
              waves back sheepishly.
 
              Keri and Molly continue toward the dorms...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Molly, of all the people... if I
                        can't trust my resident assistant,
                        then what?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I know.  I'm really, really sorry,
                        Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the
                        job... it's the only way I can
                        afford to stay here.
 
                                  KERI
                        Okay, tell you what... you can
                        still be the school R.A., but no
                        dance tomorrow night.
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (relieved)
                        Okay... thank you.

              Molly gives Keri a hug...
 
                                  KERI
                        Something tells me I won't get the
                        same reaction when I tell John...
 
              The two are completely unaware of...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              watching from the thicket, the moonlight reflected off his
              pale white mask.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
 
              STUDENTS scurry from their dorms to the adjacent school
              building, racing to make it to their a.m. classes on time...
 
              SUPER the legend:  "October 31st.  Halloween."
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - MORNING
 
              A group of students take laps in the indoor swimming pool
              beneath the retracted gymnasium floor.
 
              The gym is decorated for the Halloween festival that night...
 
              Their coach, MRS. ROCKWELL, supervises from poolside, whistle
              dangling around her neck.
 
              ON Molly, Linda, and SARAH LOCKE, the resident gossip with
              beauty pageant good looks, as they complete their final lap.
 
              They congregate in the shallow end, their goggles perched on
              their heads...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I feel like everyone's staring at
                        me.
 
                                  SARAH
                        News travels fast.  It's all over
                        school about you and John getting
                        busted in the woods by Miss Tate.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Don't suppose you had anything to
                        do with that, motor mouth.
 
                                  SARAH
                        Shut up, freak.

              Mrs. Rockwell blows her WHISTLE... the girls in the pool wait
              for her instruction.
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Alright, I know you girls have the
                        big Halloween dance tonight, so
                        I'm letting you go ten minutes
                        early today.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (under her breath)
                        How generous of her.
 
              Molly, Linda, and Sarah start to climb out of the pool...
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Sarah, since you took it upon
                        yourself to arrive ten minutes
                        late today, you can stay the extra
                        ten minutes.
 
                                  SARAH
                        But Mrs. Rockwell...
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Use the time to practice your
                        drive.  You looked real sloppy out
                        there today.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Ooooh, busted.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Big time.  And news travels fast.
                        Wouldn't be surprised if the whole
                        school knows about this one by
                        tonight.
 
              Sarah flips them the finger...
 
                                  SARAH
                        Smile at the birdie, ladies.
 
              Molly and Linda head toward the locker room...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Sarah Locke.  What a major bitch.
                        You know she waxes her stomach?
 
              Molly and Linda exit the gymnasium...
 
              ON Sarah as she climbs out of the pool... walks to the diving
              board on the other end of the deserted gym... places the
              goggles over her eyes...

              She dives into the water... swims underwater toward the
              shallow end... she heads toward the surface...
 
              SARAH POV
 
              The SHAPE is standing poolside... his image warped by the
              rolling water, bobbing and swaying with the current.
 
              Sarah breaks through the surface of the water, catches her
              breath... throws off her goggles, scans the gym...
 
              ANGLE ON THE GYMNASIUM
 
              Empty.  Not a soul in sight.
 
              Sarah shrugs it off, climbs back out of the pool... heads for
              the diving board...
 
              She dives into the water... as she emerges in the shallow end
              the lights in the gym extinguish... leaving her in darkness.
 
                                  SARAH
                            (calling out)
                        Hey!  There's someone in here!
 
              No response.  Sarah moves toward the stairs...
 
                                  SARAH
                            (continuing)
                        Hell-o!  I'm in here!
 
              She grabs the railing, starts to pull herself out of the
              pool, when suddenly...
 
              THE SHAPE GRABS HER BY THE NECK.
 
              Pushes her back into the pool... holds her head under the
              water... her arms flail wildly as she struggles for breath...
 
              The Shape flashes a knife... slices into flesh...
 
              Sarah's body goes limp... the SHAPE releases her... her
              lifeless body floats face down in the bloody water.
 
              WIDE OF THE GYMNASIUM
 
              The SHAPE has disappeared from view.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG.
 
              The gym floor begins to close over the pool, covering the
              floating corpse inside of it.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - DAY
 
              Keri moves across campus, notices --
 
              THE MASSIVE WROUGHT IRON GATES
 
              open to the single lane road exiting the school.
 
              Keri eyes the GUARDHOUSE that sits at the entrance, indignant.
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Keri enters, the guard house is empty...
 
                                  KERI
                            (calling off)
                        Hattie?
 
              She's nowhere in sight...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Now where is she?
 
              Keri pushes a BUTTON on the console in front of her.
 
              THE GATES
 
              slowly begin to close...
 
              KERI
 
              exits the guard house, closes the door behind her... heads
              back to the school.
 
              CLOSE ON:  A COFFEE MUG
 
              sits on the console, filled with a deep red liquid...
 
              PLOP!
 
              A drop of blood falls from
 
              THE CEILING
 
              Blood soaks the drop-ceiling... Hattie's corpse hidden from
              view.
 
              CLANG!
 
              The GATES SHUT tight...
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
 
              Keri walks into her office, shuts the door behind her...
              turns to find
 
              CARTER
 
              seated in front of her desk... Blake stands beside him,
              looking out the office window...
 
              Keri jumps at the sight of the uninvited guests --
 
                                  KERI
                            (startled)
                        Shit!
 
              Carter stands, takes one look at her and knows he's hit the
              jackpot...
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'll be damned.
 
                                  KERI
                        Do I know you?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        We're sorry to startle you, Miss
                        Tate.
 
                                  CARTER
                        The door was open, so we let
                        ourselves in.
 
                                  KERI
                        I can see that.  Who are you?
 
              Carter flashes a smile, then his badge...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Detective Carter from the
                        Haddonfield P.D.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
 
              Keri knows exactly why they're here, her dual lives are
              crossing paths... they've found little sister.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Mind if we sit down?
 
                                  KERI
                        I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very
                        busy.

                                  CARTER
                        Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a
                        few questions?
 
                                  KERI
                        Detective...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Carter.
 
                                  KERI
                        ... I think it would be best if
                        you both left.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Might want to stop and think about
                        the safety of your students, Miss
                        Tate.
 
                                  KERI
                        I never stop thinking about it,
                        Detective.
                            (pointing out the window)
                        The only way in or out of this
                        school is through that gate, and
                        it is secured at all times.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Funny, we just drove right in.
 
                                  KERI
                        Well, I can assure you, it won't
                        happen again.  Thanks for your
                        concern.  Goodbye.
 
              Carter starts out... turns back toward Keri.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Has anyone ever told you, you bear
                        a striking resemblance to Laurie
                        Strode?
 
              Keri glares at him for a beat... the walls around her are
              collapsing.
 
                                  KERI
                        Never heard of her.
 
              Blake removes a business card from her pocket, a phone number
              scribbled across its face.  She places it on the desk...

                                  BLAKE
                        The Ferndale P.D. is setting up a
                        roadblock couple miles down the
                        road.  They think they're looking
                        for a jealous boyfriend gone
                        mad... I think differently.  We
                        can protect you..
 
              Keri doesn't flinch, motions toward the door.  Carter and
              Blake start out --
 
                                  KERI
                        You can't stop him.
 
              Carter stops, turns back toward her...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Not without some help.
 
              Carter and Blake exit, shut the door behind them...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. GATES - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
 
              Carter and Blake in a rental car to the side of the road just
              outside the gates.
 
              Blake emerges from the passenger side... Carter tosses her a
              walkie-talkie...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Don't be a stranger...
 
              Carter pulls away from the school...
 
              Blake hooks the walkie-talkie to her side, heads back into
              the campus, passes --
 
              A CAR
 
              hidden behind the bushes, Eddie's rotting corpse locked
              inside...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - A HALF HOUR LATER
 
              Lots of nubile young bodies moving to and fro, changing out
              of sweaty gym clothes into dry attire.
 
              ON Molly, standing in front of a fogged-up mirror, straight
              from the shower... towel tucked firmly around her chest.

              Linda stands to her right, putting on her make-up... also in
              a towel.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Shane's going as a condom.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I thought you were allergic to
                        latex.
 
                                  LINDA
                        I'll pop a Benadryl.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You think they'll let him in
                        dressed like that?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just
                        tell them he's going as a sausage
                        casing.
 
              Linda swipes her palm across the fogged-up mirror, wiping
              away the steam...
 
              ON the MIRROR.  In its reflection we see Molly and Linda...
              then --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears from the cloud of steam behind them!
 
              Other STUDENTS spot the intruder, run SCREAMING from the
              locker room.
 
              The SHAPE grabs Linda from behind... wields a knife... slits
              her throat... blood cascades down her neck, 'blemishes the
              towel around her bust.
 
              ON Molly, immobile.  Terrified.  Unable to scream.
 
              LINDA'S
 
              lifeless body drops to the floor... eyes wide open in terror.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              shifts his attention to
 
              MOLLY
 
              gets her legs back, runs like hell... runs smack into

              KERI
 
              at the locker room entrance... grabs Molly in her arms.
 
                                  KERI
                        Whoa.  What's going on in there?
 
              Molly is on the verge of hysterics --
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Linda!  He killed Linda!
 
                                  KERI
                        Who?!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Michael Meyers!
 
              Keri darts into the locker room...
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (continuing)
                        Miss Tate, wait!
 
              Molly follows her, stands in the relative safety of the
              doorway... Keri walks in to find --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing above Linda's lifeless body... knife raised high in
              the air, dripping blood.
 
              ON Keri, her legs buckle... she struggles to stay standing.
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael, nooooooo!
 
              Then, an even more bizarre sight --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              starts to CHUCKLE... his shoulders bobbing up and down...
              bending over slightly at the waist.
 
              LINDA'S
 
              lifeless body starts trembling with laughter.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              reaches up to his mask, pulls it off... it's JOHN!

                                  JOHN
                        That was classic...
                            (imitating Keri)
                        "Michael, nooooooo!"
 
              LINDA
 
              sits up, licks some blood off her fingers.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Mmmm.  Anyone got some French
                        fries?
 
              John and Linda cracks up.
 
              ON Keri, mortified... the sight of her son dressed like his
              homicidal uncle is almost too much for her to bear...
 
              John and Linda are too busy revealing in their prank to
              notice...
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Molly, you should have seen your
                        face...
 
              Keri crosses over to John... SLAPS him across the face, hard.
              John reels, probably the first time Keri's laid a hand on
              him...
 
                                  KERI
                        Home... NOW!
 
              Keri grabs John by the arm, pushes him past Molly...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
 
              John sits on the sofa.  Will stands behind him... neither
              sure exactly what they're doing there.
 
              Keri paces in front of them...
 
                                  JOHN
                        I'm sorry, alright?  It was just
                        a stupid joke.
 
                                  KERI
                        Will, sit down...
 
              Will does.

                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        There's something I have to tell
                        you both.  It's going to sound
                        strange...
 
                                  WILL
                        What?
 
                                  KERI
                        My name hasn't always been Keri
                        Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
 
                                  WILL
                        You're right.  It does sound
                        strange.
 
                                  JOHN
                        You some kind of fugitive or
                        something?
 
                                  KERI
                        I was trying to get away from
                        someone.
 
                                  WILL
                        Who?
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael Meyers.
 
                                  WILL
                        The serial killer?
 
                                  KERI
                        He's my brother.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Now you're joking, right?
 
                                  KERI
                        Afraid not.  You can pick your
                        friends, but you can't pick your
                        family.
 
                                  WILL
                        Keri, have you been...
 
              Will mimes taking a drink from a bottle...
 
                                  KERI
                        No, Will, this isn't the alcohol
                        talking.  It's the truth.

                                  WILL
                        I can't believe this is happening.
 
                                  KERI
                        Shit happens.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Wait a minute... slow down...
                        you're telling me Michael Meyers
                        is my uncle?
 
                                  KERI
                        Yes.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Any other psychotic relatives I
                        should know about?  Jason?  Freddy
                        Krueger?
 
                                  KERI
                        No.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Why didn't you tell me?
 
                                  KERI
                        I was trying to protect you from
                        this...
 
              Keri holds up this trademark Halloween mask, a tuft of hair
              tightly in her grip...
 
              John crosses to the front door, opens it...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Where are you going?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I don't know.
 
              John exits.  Keri starts after him, Will grabs her by the
              arm...
 
                                  WILL
                        You just dropped a shitload on
                        him... give him some time to
                        digest it.
 
                                  KERI
                        Are you going to leave, too?
 
                                  WILL
                        Never.

              Keri nuzzles her head against Will's chest...
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        So you're really Michael Meyers'
                        sister?
 
                                  KERI
                        Yeah.
 
                                  WILL
                        Do we have to invite him to the
                        wedding?
 
              Keri laughs, more out of relief than anything...

              EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              A couple of Ferndale P.D. SQUAD CARS flank either side of the
              road.
 
              ROADBLOCKS
 
              lined up across the asphalt deny access to the roadway
              leading to Hillcrest.
 
              ON Carter, leaning against a squad car.  Deputy Clark stands
              next to him.  Carter lights up a cigarette...
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Don't worry, Detective.  No one's
                        getting up to that school.
 
                                  CARTER
                        And this is the only way up to
                        Hillcrest?
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Sure is.  Unless your boy can fly.
 
                                  CARTER
                        I hope not.
 
              Deputy Clark laughs, Carter doesn't... just takes another
              drag off his cigarette...

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
 
              Darkness falls... Halloween night.

              COSTUMED STUDENTS
 
              make their way inside the gymnasium.
 
              ON A BAND OF MISFITS.
 
              Freshman, armed with cartons of eggs and rolls of toilet
              paper, emerge stealthily from the wooded acreage... they
              attack the Hillcrest Administrative Building.
 
              ON WALLY.
 
              The school custodian heads for the bell tower... spots the
              young punks across campus defacing what he works so hard to
              preserve.
 
              He takes off in their direction.
 
                                  WALLY
                            (calling off)
                        Hey, you kids!  Knock that off!
                        Get over here!
 
              The boys see Wally headed in their direction... they
              scramble, head back for the woods... a few of them throw eggs
              in Wally's direction.
 
              Wally makes it about halfway across campus before his old
              ticker kicks in... he has to stop... catches his breath.
 
                                  WALLY
                            (continuing)
                        Damn kids.
 
              Wally turns around, heads back to the bell tower.
 
              One by one the freshman disappear into the thicket... one of
              the boys runs smack into...
 
              THE SHAPE.
 
              The boys stares up at him, startled... he darts after his
              friends... the SHAPE continues toward Hillcrest.
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              Molly sits on the windowpane, her forehead pressed against
              the glass.  Lurch, the dog, lies across her bed.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              A view of the entire campus.  Couples make their way across
              the grounds, move inside the gymnasium.

              Molly lets out a sigh, wishes that were her and John... she
              continues to stare longingly out the window...
 
              THROUGH THE GLASS
 
              ON Wally as he moves to the bell tower, disappears inside.
              He is followed by...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              ON Molly.  She sits up, takes notice... watches as the SHAPE
              moves inside the bell tower, then suddenly...
 
              A PAIR OF HANDS
 
              grabs Molly by the shoulders... spins her around, revealing...
 
              LINDA
 
              in full "Bride of Frankenstein" costume.
 
                                  LINDA
                        BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Shit, Linda!
 
                                  LINDA
                        You're so easy...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Wasn't scaring the hell out of me
                        once today enough?!
 
                                  LINDA
                        Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win
                        scariest costume?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Linda, you are without a doubt the
                        scariest person on campus.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Thanks!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Where's Shane?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Condom Boy is waiting for me in
                        the cafeteria.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        But the dance is in the gymnasium.

                                  LINDA
                        Very insightful.
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Echoes across the campus.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Let the party begin.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Have enough fun for the both of us.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Oh, don't be such a victim.
 
              Linda produces a couple of shot bottles from her purse,
              tosses them on the bed.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Here.  Drink a couple of these.
                        It'll putcha in a much better
                        mood.  Ta-ta.
 
              Linda exits.  The bell continues to ring.  Molly sits on the
              bed, pats Lurch on the head.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Guess it's just you and me, boy.
 
              The bell stops ringing abruptly.  Molly turns her attention
              back to the window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              At the top of the bell tower... the SHAPE stands beside the
              massive bell... staring in Molly's direction, looking right
              through her.
 
              Molly gasps softly.  She looks down below and sees...
 
              LINDA
 
              leave the dormitory, heads for the cafeteria.  Molly looks
              back up to the bell tower... the SHAPE has vanished.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Just some idiot in a costume...
 
              Molly sits back on her bed, uses Lurch as a pillow... Molly
              picks up one of the shot bottles, twists off the lid.

                                  MOLLY
                            (continuing)
                        Let the party begin.
 
              Molly takes a swig from the bottle.  She shudders, her sour
              expression says it all...
 
              INT. CAFETERIA
 
              Dark and abandoned.  THE CAMERA PANS across a bevy of empty
              tables and chairs to reveal...
 
              LINDA AND SHANE
 
              liplocked, hands all over each other.  Linda sits on the edge
              of a table.
 
              Shane, dressed as a condom, stands between her legs.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              watches from the kitchen, illuminated only by the light from
              a nearby soda machine.
 
              Shane pushes Linda down onto the table, starts to unbutton
              her blouse...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Wait.
 
                                  SHANE
                        What is it?
 
                                  LINDA
                        I have to pee.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Can't you hold it?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Can't you?
 
              Linda pushes Shane off her, heads for the restroom.  She
              passes the kitchen area... the SHAPE is nowhere in sight.
 
              Linda enters the bathroom...
 
              INT. BATHROOM
 
              Linda crosses to a shall, tugs on the door... it's locked.
              She knocks on the door.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Somebody in there?

              No answer.  She pulls at it again... still doesn't budge.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Hellooooo.
 
              She kneels down on the ground, peers under the door.  Nothing.
 
              She stands back up... shrugs it off... moves to the next
              stall and goes inside, closing the door behind her.
 
              TIGHT ON DOOR
 
              As Linda takes care of "business."
 
                                  LINDA (O.S.)
                            (singing)
                        IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY.
                        AND YOU WANT MY BODY.
                        COME ON, BABY.  LET ME KNOW.
 
              The toilet flushes.  Linda emerges from the stall, crosses to
              the mirror... checks her make-up.
 
              ANGLE ON THE MIRROR
 
              Linda admires her reflection... not noticing the stall door
              which was previously locked is now opened.
 
              She smiles at herself, licks her teeth, then exits to the
              hallway.
 
              INT. CAFETERIA
 
              Linda emerges from the bathroom... she heads toward the
              center of the room...
 
              ANGLE ON THE CAFETERIA
 
              Empty.  No sign of Shane anywhere.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (calling off)
                        Shane?
 
              CLANG!  A NOISE FROM THE KITCHEN.
 
              Linda moves into the kitchen area where...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              emerges from the shadows, attacks Linda... grabs her by the
              throat, lifts her into the air...

              Her head hits the pot rack hanging above her... pots and pans
              drop to the tile floor below...
 
              Linda flails her arms and legs, desperately trying to free
              herself form the SHAPE'S grasp...
 
              She kicks the refrigerator door behind her... it swings open
              to reveal...
 
              SHANE'S BODY STUFFED INSIDE.
 
              Asphyxiated, his condom hat pulled down over his head... his
              corpse topples out of her refrigerator, falls onto the
              floor...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              flicks the switch on a nearby MEAT SLICER, it WHIRS to life.
 
              The Shape forces Linda's head against the slicer... she
              struggles furiously as her cheek approaches the spinning
              blade...
 
              BLOOD SPLATTERS
 
              everywhere as Linda is carved into quarter-inch slices...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
 
              VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty campus, all the students now
              congregated inside the gymnasium.
 
              The pulsating beat of faint dance MUSIC drifts across the
              grounds.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The festival is in full swing... jam packed with costumed
              couples dancing across the floor.  CHAPERONES line the walls.
 
              KERI
 
              leans against the refreshment table, sans costume.  Arms
              folded... there in body, mind elsewhere.
 
              WILL
 
              approaches her, dressed as Count Dracula.  He offers Keri a
              glass of punch...

                                  WILL
                            (as Dracula)
                        May I offer you some fresh blood?
                        I squeezed it myself.
 
              Keri glances at him, not amused...
 
                                  KERI
                        Not a real fan of Halloween humor,
                        Will.
 
                                  WILL
                            (realizing)
                        Oh, right.  Sorry.
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm gonna head back to the
                        office... finish up some things.
 
                                  WILL
                        Can't it wait till Monday?  I
                        thought maybe we could dance...
                            (as Dracula)
                        I'm very light of my feet.
 
              Keri manages a sincere smile, gives him a kiss...
 
                                  KERI
                        Thanks, but I'm not much in the
                        mood for dancing.  Enjoy the
                        party... you did a great job.
 
              Keri heads for the exit, Will watches her leave...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              CLOSE ON A HALF EMPTY SHOT BOTTLE
 
              on the bedside table, next to two other shot bottles...
              untouched.  CAMERA PANS to the bed where...
 
              MOLLY
 
              lies, fully clothed... facing the ceiling.  Eyes wide open,
              thinking of the night that could have been...
 
              ON Lurch, lying on the floor beside the bed... he sits up,
              his eyes focused on...

              THE CLOSET
 
              Its door slightly ajar...  the lights on inside.  Something
              inside catches Lurch's attention... he GROWLS.
 
              Molly reaches over the side of the bed, pats the dog on his
              head.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Whatcha growling at, huh?
 
              Lurch continues to snarl at the closet.  Molly sits up in the
              bed...
 
              ANGLE ON THE CLOSET
 
              Light seeps out from the cracks in the open door, illuminating
              the sleeves of several hanging blouses.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Lurch, there's nothing in there
                        but clothes.
 
              Molly gets up... moves to the closet, open it...
 
              INSIDE THE CLOSET
 
              Wall-to-wall clothes hang from wooden dowels... Molly palms
              the lightswitch, flicks off the light.
 
              Molly closes the door, tight... heads to the bathroom down
              the hall, Lurch follows her out.
 
              EXT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The misfits who tee-pee'd the school have returned, this time
              with black duffel bags in tow.
 
              ON THE REAR DOUBLE DOORS
 
              of the gymnasium... one of the FRESHMEN pulls a thick three
              foot long CHAIN from his duffel bag... wraps it around the
              door handles... he produces a PADLOCK, hooks it through the
              loops of the chain... snaps it shut, locked tight.
 
              ON THE GYMNASIUM ENTRANCE
 
              Another freshman sneaks into the gymnasium, while a fellow
              SCHOOLMATE hide behind some bushes... on the lookout for
              Wally.
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              Molly returns from the bathroom, passes...

              THE CLOSET DOOR.
 
              It's ajar once again.
 
              Molly climbs into bed, turns on her side... she reaches over
              to the side of the bed... pets the dog.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Guess there's always next year...
                        if I live past the humiliation of
                        tonight.
 
              At that very moment, Molly sees...
 
              LURCH!
 
              The dog enters the room, sits in the doorway... growls in her
              direction.
 
              ON Molly.  Shit!  She instantly stops petting whatever is
              under the bed.
 
              CLOSE ON HER EYES
 
              full of confusion, flushes with fear.
 
              Terrified, she slowly leans over the edge of the bed... comes
              eye-to-eye with --
 
              THE SHAPE!
 
              Beneath her bed, staring right at her... she was petting the
              hair on his mask all along.
 
              Molly SCREAMS.  The SHAPE grabs her arm, drags her off the
              bed onto the floor.
 
              Molly struggles with him, as he tries to climb on top of her.
 
              The SHAPE maintains a strong grip on her ankle with one hand,
              swings a knife fiercely at her with the other.
 
              He makes contact, slices open her left thigh...
 
              Molly SCREAMS in agony, kicks her legs wildly... she manages
              to strike a hard blow to his head.
 
              She breaks free of his grip, takes off limping down the
              hall... her hand pressed against the gaping wound carved in
              her thigh.
 
              ANGLE ON THE HALL
 
              Seems to stretch for miles...

              Molly limps down the corridor, dragging her leg behind her...
              she looks behind her... no sign for the SHAPE... yet.
 
              She ducks into one of the room, hides behind the door.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              emerges from her room... heads down the hall.
 
              ON Molly trying desperately not to breathe, she watches as...
 
              THE SHADOW OF THE SHAPE
 
              passes by... she lets out a silent sigh of relief, when
              suddenly...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              steps back into the doorway, looks into the room.
 
              Molly freezes, looks at the wall beside her, she sees...
 
              HER OWN SHADOW
 
              projected on the wall, it betrays her.
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (squealing)
                        Oh, God...
 
              The SHAPE reaches through the crack in the hinged side of the
              door... grabs Molly by the hair, reels her in.
 
              Molly grabs the door... pulls it towards her, smashing the
              SHAPE'S arm between the door and the jam.  He releases her...
 
              She flies out of the room, down the hall... stumbles down a
              flight of stairs... dashes out of the dormitory.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The party is in full swing.  Students and teachers alike
              crowd the gym floor, dancing to the music blaring from the
              loudspeakers above.
 
              CLOSE ON A SIGN
 
              "CAUTION: BE SURE TO CLEAR GYM AND/OR POOL
              BEFORE OPERATING FLOOR"
 
              Hung above a large red button.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO
              REVEAL the freshman, who snuck in earlier, poised beneath
              it...

              He punches the button, then pops it off and puts it in his
              pocket... he darts for the front entrance.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!
 
              The gymnasium floor begins to move beneath the students'
              feet, splits right down the middle... retracts into the
              walls...
 
              The students part like the Red Sea, hooting and hollering as
              the pool beneath them is revealed.
 
              EXT. GYMNASIUM
 
              The freshman flies out of the gym, slams the doors shut
              behind him... his schoolmate chains the doors, locks them
              with a padlock.  They dart for the woods, passing...
 
              MOLLY
 
              stumbles towards them, her pants bloodied.  She SCREAMS,
              tries to get their attention... they disappear into the
              thicket.
 
              She moves to the rear of the gymnasium, bangs on the chained
              doors... SCREAMS for help, looks over her shoulder to see...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              headed straight for her.  She hobbles to the front entrance,
              bangs on the door...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Let me in!  Oh, God, help me!
                        Somebody... goddamnit!
 
              The SHAPE closes in.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              Molly's screams are lost amongst the gleeful SQUEALS of the
              party goers.
 
              The floor continues to glide open beneath their feet,
              revealing...
 
              SARAH
 
              floating, face down in the pool... water tainted bright red
              with her blood, illuminated by the pool light.
 
              The mood suddenly changes... the SCREAMS of excitement
              quickly turn into SHRIEKS of horror.  Bedlam ensues...

              Frightened students scramble toward the entrance, knocking
              party goers into the pool... trampling over others.
 
              AT THE ENTRANCE
 
              Students stack up against the doors, pounding furiously...
              trying to get out.
 
              WILL
 
              tries to calm the petrified party-goers...
 
              INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
 
              Keri sits behind her desk, Detective Blake's BUSINESS CARD in
              hand...
 
              She picks up the phone, brings it to her ear...
 
              NO DIAL TONE.
 
              She jiggles the receiver... STILL NOTHING.  She is distracted
              by --
 
              MOLLY'S SCREAMS
 
              from outside her office.  Keri crosses to the window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              Molly standing at the gymnasium entrance, pounding against
              the door with bloody palms... screaming bloody murder, trying
              desperately to get in, while the students on the other side
              try in vain to get out.
 
                                  KERI
                        Molly?
 
              The SHAPE approaches her, now only a few feet away.
 
              Molly tugs feverishly at the chains, they hold tight.  She
              bolts for the bell tower, trailing blood... the SHAPE follows.
 
              ON Keri, horrified... he's back.  She charges out of the
              office, on a mission...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BELL TOWER
 
              Molly bursts through the door... she stops at the bottom of
              the staircase, looks up to see...

              FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS
 
              spiraling high above her.  She hobbles up the stairway,
              grunting in agony...
 
              As she makes her ascent, she looks down to see...
 
              A SHADOW
 
              three flights down, begins its climb up the stairs.  Molly
              picks up the pace...
 
              EXT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS
 
              Molly emerges at the top of the bell tower... runs over to
              the rope dangling from the massive bell... pulls with all her
              might, causes...
 
              THE BELL
 
              to swing... BUT there is no sound!
 
              Molly frantically pulls the rope again, SCREAMING madly...
              trying desperately to get someone's attention...
 
              Still no sound!  She moves to the gargantuan bell, looks
              inside and sees...
 
              WALLY'S BODY
 
              stuffed up inside of it, preventing the clapper from striking
              the bell.
 
              Molly reaches in, grabs Wally's shirt... tugs with all her
              might... expels the cadaver with a final heave-ho.
 
              ON Wally's corpse as it falls four stories down, lands at the
              foot of the staircase.
 
              Molly stumbles back... wraps the rope around her wrists, tugs
              with all her weight...
 
              RING-RING-RING!  THE BELL RESONATES ACROSS CAMPUS.  A call
              for help...
 
              Molly continues to pull at the rope, her wrists bleeding as
              the cord digs into her skin.  She watches in horror as...
 
              A SHADOW
 
              approaches the top of the stairway... a FIGURE emerges,
              it's...

              THE SHAPE
 
              Molly SCREAMS... the SHAPE grabs he... wraps the ROPE tightly
              around her neck... Molly grasp for breath.
 
              ON KERI
 
              Running furiously across the campus... trying desperately to
              reach the bell tower in time...
 
              ON THE SHAPE
 
              Moves Molly to the wall of the bell tower, tosses her over
              the edge....
 
              ON KERI
 
              Watches in horror as Molly falls two flights before the rope
              goes taunt, snapping her neck instantly... the bell CLANGS.
 
                                  KERI
                        NOOOOOOOOO!
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              A group of STUDENTS, with Will at the helm, use a WOODEN
              BENCH as a battering ram...
 
              BOOM!
 
              The bench slams against the gym entrance, the metal doors
              start to buckle...
 
              BOOM!
 
              ON THE GYMNASIUM DOORS, the weight of the wooden bench pops
              the chains wrapped around the handles, the doors fly open...
 
              KERI
 
              watches as crazed STUDENTS pour out of the gymnasium, head
              for the parked buses across campus...
 
              STUDENTS spot Molly dangling from the bell tower... SCREAMS
              of terror echo across campus...
 
              Keri turns back to the bell tower... the SHAPE IS GONE!
 
                                  KERI
                            (realizing)
                        John...
 
              She heads toward --

              THE PARKED SCHOOL BUSES
 
              being filled to capacity with screaming teens...
 
              WILL
 
              leads the charge of getting all students safely aboard.
 
              KERI
 
              manages to find John amongst the throng...
 
                                  KERI
                        John!
 
              Mother and son reunite...
 
                                  JOHN
                        He found you, didn't he?
 
                                  KERI
                        Get on the bus.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Where's Molly?  She's not in her
                        room...
 
                                  KERI
                        Just get on the bus.
 
                                  JOHN
                        I'm not leaving without her.
 
                                  KERI
                        John, you can't help her now.
 
                                  JOHN
                        What?  Where is she?
 
                                  KERI
                        John...
 
              Keri's at a loss for words, it's written all over her face...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Oh, God... no... not Molly.
 
                                  KERI
                        Please, get on the bus...
 
              John hesitates for a beat... climbs into the bus, takes a
              window seat...

              WILL
 
              crosses to Keri, hugs her tight...
 
                                  WILL
                        Keri, you all right?
 
                                  KERI
                        We've got to get these kids out of
                        here...
 
                                  WILL
                        I'll make sure there's no kids
                        left in the dorms...
 
              WILL
 
              dashes toward the dorms...
 
              KERI
 
              climbs aboard the bus, stands next to the driver... waits
              impatiently for Will to return.
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY
 
              The BUSES are on the move... leaving the academy single
              file...
 
              ON JOHN
 
              Watching from inside his bus as it prepares to leave...
 
              ON KERI
 
              Waves to John through the window, knows this may be the last
              time she ever sees him.
 
              She turns to the driver --
 
                                  KERI
                        You go ahead.  Will and I will
                        follow you in my car.
 
              The DRIVER nods in agreement...
 
              JOHN'S POV
 
              Keri gets off the bus, watches as the last bus drives through
              the open gates of the academy...
 
              Keri crosses to the dorms, disappears inside --

              INT. DORMS
 
              Keri moves noiselessly down the hallway... searching for any
              sign of Will... holding her breath with every door she checks
              behind...
 
                                  KERI
                            (a loud whisper)
                        Will... Will, where are you?
 
              Keri rounds a corner, spots --
 
              SMOKE
 
              seeping through the cracks of a swinging door leading to the
              dorm's kitchenette.
 
              KERI
 
              crosses to the swinging door, slowly pushes it open to
              reveal --
 
              WILL
 
              his whole upper torso shoved into the oven, clothes ablaze.
 
              KERI
 
              runs into the kitchen, yanks Will out of the oven by his legs.
 
              ON WILL.  Hair singed-off his head, his face a mangled mass
              of burning flesh, mouth agape in horror...
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, God, Will...
 
              Keri kneels down beside him, helpless... filled with rage...
 
              SWOOSH!
 
              The kitchen door swings violently to and fro... Keri spins
              around, startled by --
 
              LURCH
 
              The dog jumps on her chest, licks her face gleefully.
 
                                  KERI
                        Get off me...
 
              The dog's mood changes suddenly: he stops licking Keri and
              GROWLS ferociously at something behind her...
 
              Keri slowly turns around to see --

              THE SHAPE
 
              standing above her, comes down on her with a knife... makes
              contact, slices her shoulder wide open.
 
              KERI
 
              scrambles to her feet, grabs a pot off the stove... swings at
              the SHAPE.
 
              CLANG!
 
              Delivers a hard blow to the SHAPE'S head with the iron pot.
              The SHAPE stumbles backward, Keri sprints out the door...
 
              EXT. DORMS
 
              Keri comes running from the building, dashes across campus
              and into --
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Keri bursts through the door, runs down the hallway into --
 
              INT. BEDROOM
 
              CLOSE ON: DETECTIVE BLAKE
 
              Her body sprawled across Keri's bed, THROAT SLIT from ear-to-
              ear... a TOMBSTONE in lieu of a headboard, "LAURIE STRODE"
              carved into stone.
 
                                  KERI
                        You son of a bitch!
 
              The fury wells inside of her.  Keri crosses to the bed, drops
              to her knees... pulls out the metal box underneath the
              mattress... opens it... IT'S EMPTY!
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Shit!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY
 
              Keri runs from the house, determined... makes her way across
              campus to --
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Keri crosses to the console, pushes the BUTTON that controls
              the gate... it begins to close slowly.

              CRASH!
 
              Hattie's body falls from the drop-ceiling above, lands right
              on top of Keri.  Shit.  Keri throws the bloody corpse off of
              her.
 
              She looks around the room... zeroes in on the large CB
              RADIO... she picks it up and SMASHES it against the
              console... over and over again... sparks fly... the gate now
              permanently closed.
 
              Keri reaches down, pulls Hattie's key ring from her body...
              moves outside.
 
              EXT. GATES
 
              Keri moves to the gate... locks it using Hattie's keys, then
              tosses them over the gate into the brush.
 
                                  KERI
                            (calling off)
                        Time to put an end to this
                        nightmare, motherfucker!
 
              Keri heads back toward the school.

              EXT. ROADBLOCK - SAME TIME
 
              Deputy Clark lies on the hood of his patrol car, hat over his
              face... catching some z's.  Carter stands by the wooden
              barriers, spots --
 
              THE LINE OF BUSES
 
              speeding toward the roadblock, headed for the small town
              below...
 
                                  CARTER
                        What the hell?
 
              Deputy Clark is awakened by the approaching caravan.  Carter
              waves down a bus, moves to the door --
 
                                  CARTER
                            (continuing)
                        What's happening?
 
                                  DRIVER
                        We're evacuating the school. Been
                        two murders up there tonight.
                        Killer's still on the loose...

                                  CARTER
                        Goddamnit!
 
              Carter runs back to the patrol car, followed by Deputy Clark.
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                            (calling off)
                        Call for back-up!
 
              A flurry of action as OFFICERS clear the roadblocks, get on
              the radio and call for back-up...
 
              Carter and Deputy Clark climb into the patrol car, headed for
              the school...
 
              Carter grabs his walkie-talkie, barks into it --
 
                                  CARTER
                        Blake, what's going on up there!

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - SAME TIME
 
              VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty campus.  Keri moves brazenly
              across school grounds, looking for the big brother....
 
              As she passes the bell tower, she sees --
 
              A SHADOW
 
              move inside the gymnasium... she quickly approaches --
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM
 
              Keri moves inside the decorated gym... stops at a
 
              FIRE AXE
 
              hanging behind glass... she picks up a plastic skull, smashes
              the glass with it... grabs the AXE and continues inside...
 
              CLICK!

              The lights go out... the gym now eerily illuminated only by
              carved pumpkins lit around its perimeter.
 
              Keri continues on, bravely... the fire axe tightly in her
              grip.
 
                                  KERI
                            (calling off)
                        Let's ends this right now.  You
                        want to kill me to fulfill your
                        twisted obsession, then go ahead.
                        I'm tired of playing hide-and-
                        seek, brother.  Come on, finish
                        what you started, you miserable
                        fuck.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!
 
              Keri jumps... the gymnasium floor beneath her begins to move,
              closing back over the pool...
 
              Keri continues to move alongside the pool, when --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              jumps from the bleachers, buries a knife deep into Keri's
              arm... she SCREAMS in pain... drops the fire axe into the
              pool.
 
              The Shape pulls the knife from Keri's arm, stands above
              her... he raises the knife high into the air, about to plunge
              it straight into Keri's heart, when --
 
              BANG! A BULLET BURROWS INTO THE SHAPE'S SHOULDER.
 
              Spins him around, comes face-to-face with...
 
              JOHN
 
              standing behind him, wielding Keri's SMITH AND WESSON.  The
              SHAPE moves toward him.
 
              BANG!  BANG!  BANG!
 
              JOHN empties the chamber into the Shape, thrust him
              backward...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              falls into the pool, pulls Keri into the water with him...

              KERI
 
              struggles to climb out of the pool, the Shape fights to pull
              her back in....
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              finds the axe, swings at Keri... slice open her thigh.
 
              JOHN
 
              grabs Keri by the arms, manages to pull her out.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              strives to climb out of the water as the gym floor continues
              to close... he swings the axe, buries the blade into the gym
              floor... grabs the handle, uses it to pull himself out...
 
              KERI
 
              grabs a JAVELIN hanging on the wall...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              pulls his upper torso out of the water just as
 
              KERI
 
              raises the javelin high into the air, when --
 
              CLOSE ON: THE SHAPE
 
              Reaches out for her... then, a sound altogether unnatural --
 
                                  THE SHAPE
                            (a desperate plea)
                        Laurie...
 
              Time stands still -- TOTAL SILENCE.
 
              ON KERI.  All the love and loss of the past twenty years
              plays all over her face, when --
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael...
                            (then)
                        Go to hell!
 
              KERI
 
              plunges the javelin through his body with all her might,
              pierces his heart... the javelin juts out of his back.

              THE SHAPE
 
              arches his back in pain, grabs the metal rod... tries
              desperately to remove it, sinks into the water...
 
              THE GYM FLOOR
 
              closes above him... CLANG!
 
              Half the javelin sticks out above the floor... it twitches
              fiercely, then stops...
 
              CARTER
 
              storms the gym, gun drawn... followed by Deputy Clark and a
              dozen armed police officers.  He approaches Keri...
 
                                  KERI
                        Guess he was stoppable, after all.
 
              THE TERROR IS GONE.
 
              Keri and John embrace.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - A HALF HOUR LATER
 
              POLICE CARS litter the campus.  The corpse of THE SHAPE lies
              covered on a gurney... a pair of PARAMEDICS roll it past --
 
              AN AMBULANCE
 
              parked near the entrance, its rear doors open revealing --
 
              JOHN
 
              being tended to by a PARAMEDIC.  Keri sits next to him...
 
                                  JOHN
                        I just can't believe she's dead.
 
              Keri does the only thing a mother can do, gives him a hug...
 
                                  KERI
                        I love you, John.
 
              Always the guy, John just shrugs, giving her a tough smile.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Yeah, me too, Keri.
 
                                  KERI
                        Call me Laurie, will ya?

                                  JOHN
                        Keri.... Laurie... how about if I
                        just call you Mom?
 
                                  KERI
                        That would work.
 
              The two embrace an another PARAMEDIC closes the rear doors of
              the ambulance, locking Keri and John safely inside.
 
              THROUGH THE REAR WINDOWS
 
              Mother and son continue to bond as the ambulance drives off
              into the night.
 
              CUT TO BLACK.
