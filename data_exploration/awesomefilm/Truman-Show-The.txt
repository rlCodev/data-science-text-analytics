	A FOGGED MIRROR

	Behind the fog we hear the sounds of a bathroom.  After a 
	long moment, a hand wipes the condensation from the glass to 
	reveal the face of TRUMAN BURBANK.  He wears a sleeveless 
	Hanes undershirt and blue-stripes pajama bottoms, behind him 
	a white glazed tiled bathroom wall.  It is immediately 
	apparent that we are viewing him through a two-way mirror.

	Truman, expressionless, studies his reflection in the mirror.  
	For a long moment, he does nothing.  He continues to look 
	impassively into the mirror for what becomes an uncomfortably 
	long time.  Still nothing.  Finally he speaks, talking to 
	himself in the mirror as if participating in a TV interview.

				TRUMAN
		... personally I think the 
		unconquered south face is the only 
		one worth scaling... of course it's 
		a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but 
		then when did that ever stop me 
		before?  Naturally, I intend to make 
		the ascent without the benefit of 
		oxygen but also without crampons or 
		even an ice pick... risks?
			(smug, TV smiles)
		... sure I'm aware of the risks -- 
		why else do you think I would spend 
		seven years as an adjuster in a life 
		insurance company?

				MERYL (O.S.)
		Truman, you're gonna be late!

	Truman resignedly opens the door of the 
	cabinet and replaces his shaving tackle.  It 
	partially obscures the lens of the hidden 
	camera.  He closes the door and exits.

	INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

	MERYL, wearing a stylish robe, sits at the kitchen table 
	sipping coffee.  On the table in front of her lies a parcel.  
	TRUMAN enters and glances at the gift.

				TRUMAN
		What's that?

				MERYL
		It's a surprise.

	TRUMAN unwraps the parcel -- an expensive-looking set of 
	exercise sweats.

				MERYL
			(eager for his response)
		Well, what do you think?

				TRUMAN
		They're...
			(the merest hesitation)
		perfect.  Thank you.

	Truman returns Meryl's kiss.

				MERYL
			(handing him the sweat top)
		Try it on.

	Truman pulls the top over his head.  As he does so, a closer 
	shot focuses on the manufacturer's name.

				MERYL
		I thought you could wear them when 
		you do your exercises.
			(afterthought)
		Pre-shrunk.  And they breathe.

	EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Wearing a business suit, briefcase in hand, TRUMAN emerges 
	from his pleasant, Victorian-inspired, picket-fenced house 
	into an idyllic suburban street of similarly picturesque 
	homes.  A neighbor, SPENCER, is taking in trashcans, 
	whistling a tune.  Spencer breaks off abruptly as Truman 
	approaches his car.  His license plate reads, "Seahaven -- 
	A Nice Place To Live."

				SPENCER
		Morning, Truman.

				TRUMAN
		Morning, Spencer.  And in case I 
		don't see you, good afternoon, good 
		evening and good night.

	Spencer's dog, PLUTO, bounds happily over to Truman.

				TRUMAN
			(petting the dog)
		Hey, Pluto.

	Truman exchanges a polite nod with the WASHINGTON's, an 
	African-American family across the street.  MR. WASHINGTON is 
	farewelled by his WIFE and CHILD.

	Truman is about to climb into his car when he is distracted 
	by a high-pitched whistling sound.  Suddenly, a large 
	spherical glass object falls from the sky and lands with a 
	deafening crash on the street, several yards from his car.

	The startled Truman looks to Spencer but he has abruptly 
	disappeared inside his house with Pluto.  Mrs. Washington and 
	Washington Junior has also made themselves scarce.

	Truman investigates.  Amidst a sea of shattered glass are the 
	remains of a light mechanism.

	He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks 
	that all the surrounding street lights are accounted for, 
	even though the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up 
	into the sky but there is no plane in sight.  With some 
	effort, Truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light 
	and loads it into the trunk.  A label on the light fixture reads, 
	"SIRIUS (9 Canis Major)."  As he drives away, we hear the 
	sound of his car radio.

				RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Another glorious morning in Seahaven, 
		folks.

	INT/ EXT.  TRUMAN'S CAR - SEAHAVEN - DAY

	TRUMAN makes his way along the streets of Seahaven past a 
	series of quaint, pastel-shaded cottages.

	EXT.  SEAHAVEN ISLAND TOWNSHIP - DAY

	A high-angle reveals an anonymous mid-sized town built around 
	a small, pretty bay.  A cluster of high-rise buildings stand 
	at the water's edge overlooking a marina.  Surrounding the 
	commercial center lie neatly arranged suburbs.

	EXT.  OCEANSIDE STREET - DAY

	Pausing at a traffic light along a seaside road, TRUMAN looks 
	through a curious wooden arch to the beach and ocean beyond.  
	The sight triggers a memory in his head.

	PLAYBACK - EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH - DAY

	Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory 
	appears to be playing on a television screen.

	FOUR-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN runs towards a bluff on the beach.

	The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand, 
	flirts with TWO TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, 
	the father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  
	The sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him 
	to drop his bottle in the sand and run to Truman.

	The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated 
	father comes within earshot.

				FATHER
			(out of breath, 
			 clutching his side)
		Truman!  Truman!  Stop!

	Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his 
	father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the 
	anger and distress on his father's face.

				FATHER
		Come down now!

	His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more 
	tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts 
	his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek 
	at the other side.  One good stretch would do it.

				FATHER
			(reading Truman's 
			 mind, enraged)
		No!

				TRUMAN
		Why?  What's there?

				FATHER
			(unconvincing)
		Nothing.  It's... it's dangerous.
			(trace of desperation)
		Come down, now!  Please!

	Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other 
	BEACHGOERS have stopped their activities to stare at him.  
	Reluctantly, he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.  
	When he finally jumps to the sand, his father embraces him 
	and leads him away.

				FATHER
		I told you to stay close.  Don't ever 
		leave my sight again.
			(pause)
		You've got to know your limitations.  
		You could've fallen.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR - DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN - MORNING - PRESENT

	Through his car window, TRUMAN buys a cup of coffee from a 
	streetside VENDOR.

				VENDOR
		How are ya, Truman?

				TRUMAN
			(placing his fingers 
			 to his pulse)
		Vital signs are good.

	He pulls into a parking space and sips on the coffee.  And he 
	drinks, he becomes aware of a school bell summoning children 
	to class in the adjacent Elementary School.  The image 
	prompts another childhood memory.

	PLAYBACK - INT.  SEAHAVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

	Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a 
	television screen.

	SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle rrow of an Elementary 
	School classroom surrounded by twenty-or-so othegr well-
	scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.  MARLON, the boy next to Truman, 
	is on his feet under the scrutiny of a kindly Norman Rockwell-
	style SCHOOL MISTRESS.

				MISTRESS
		What do you want to do when you 
		grow up, Marlon?

				MARLON
		I want to be an entrepreneur like 
		my dad.

				SCHOOL MISTRESS
			(impressed)
		Tell the class what an "entrepreneur" 
		does, Marlon.

				MARLON
		He makes a lot of money, Ma'am.

				SCHOOL MISTRESS
		A good one does, Marlon.
			(looking in her purse, 
			 hamming it up)
		Perhaps I'll be coming to you for 
		a loan one of these days.

	The Class titters.  Marlon sits down and winks to Truman.

				SCHOOL MISTRESS
		What about you, Truman?

	Truman rises to his feet, gathering his nerve.

				TRUMAN
		I want to be an explorer...
			(with reverence)
		... like Magellan.

	The School Mistress smiles benevolently.

				SCHOOL MISTRESS
			(slightly condescending)
		I'm afraid no one's going to pay you 
		to do that, Truman.  You might have 
		to find something a little more 
		practical.
			(glancing to a pulldown 
			 wall map behind her 
			 head)
		Besides, you're too late.  There's 
		really nothing left to explore.

	The class roars with laughter as the crestfallen Truman takes 
	his seat.

	EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY - PRESENT

	TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, crosses from the parking lot to the 
	town square, surrounded by similarly suited, briefcase-toting 
	OFFICE WORKERS.

	EXT.  DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN - DAY

	TRUMAN walks briskly down the bustling city street.  A snarl of 
	taxis, buses and COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a 
	pretzel under Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN tries to catch his 
	eye.

	Truman stops at a kiosk and buys a newspaper -- "THE ISLAND 
	TIMES."

				VENDOR
		Is that all for you, Truman?

				TRUMAN
		That's all.  Thanks, Errol.

	Other CUSTOMERS also purchase the morning paper.  Tucking his 
	copy under his arm, Truman selects a glossy magazine from a 
	rack, quickly flicking through the pages.

	Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and finding 
	him busy with another CUSTOMER, Truman deftly tears a portion 
	of the open page and pockets the cutting.  He hastily replaces 
	the magazine and departs.

	As Truman hurries away, the vendor exits the kiosk and picks 
	up the magazine, instantly turning to the torn page.  It is a 
	cosmetics advertisement with the MODEL'S NOSE missing.  
	However, the vendor makes no effort to confront Truman, 
	almost as if he were expecting it.

	EXT.  SEAHAVEN LIFE AND ACCIDENT.  INC - DAY

	Truman passes along a row of shops and offices, finally 
	entering a building that proudly proclaims, "Seahaven Life & 
	Accident Inc." above the entrance.  He has evidently taken 
	his teacher's advice.

	INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - SEAHAVEN LIFE AND ACCIDENT, INC. - DAY

	In a cramped, cluttered cubicle, TRUMAN talks on the telephone.

				TRUMAN
			(into receiver)
		...okay, okay, let's call it what it 
		is...I'm not going to lie to you...
		life insurance is death insurance...
		you've just got to ask yourself two 
		questions...one, in the event of 
		your death, will anyone experience 
		financial loss?... and two, do you 
		care?

	A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.  
	Truman checks the spine -- "MARITIME ACCIDENTS."

				TRUMAN
			(into receiver)
		Hold on, will you?
			(to clerk, referring to 
			 the book)
		This is no good.  Lumps all maritime 
		accidents together.  I need drownings 
		as a separate category.

	The clerk shrugs, returns the book to his cart and continues 
	his rounds.

				TRUMAN
			(returning to his call)
		... just think about what I've been 
		saying and let me... hello?

	The person on the other end has hung up.  With an apathetic 
	shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.  He looks over his 
	shoulder and places another call.

				TRUMAN
			(lowering his voice)
		Can you connect me with directory 
		inquiries in Fiji?

	A CO-WORKER pokes his head over the neighboring cubicle.

				CO-WORKER
		What do you know, Truman?

				TRUMAN
			(embarrassed, mouthing 
			 the word)
		Can't talk.
			(waving off his neighbor, 
			 pretending to be on a 
			 business call)
		I'm sorry, ma'am.  If he's in a coma, 
		he's probably uninsurable.

	The Co-Worker disappears back into his own cubicle.

				TRUMAN
			(lowering his voice again)
		Hello, operator... yes, Fiji... Do 
		you have a listing for a Lauren 
		Garland?
			(pause)
		... nothing listed? ... what about a 
		Sylvia Garland, "S" for Sylvia... 
		nothing?  Okay, thanks...

	The disconsolate Truman replaces the receiver.  Other 
	INSURANCE AGENTS are heading to lunch.  Truman puts on his 
	jacket and follows them to the elevators.

	INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  - LUNCHTIME

	Behind a deli counter, TYRONE, fifties, is having his hair 
	brushed by a YOUNG MAN.  The man fusses one final time, then 
	swiftly departs through a rear door just as TRUMAN enters the 
	store.  Tyrone has anticipated Truman's order and has already 
	begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on an 
	Italian roll.  Truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under 
	construction, pained by his own predictability.

				TYRONE
			(nauseatingly cheerful)
		How's it going, Truman?

				TRUMAN
			(deadpan)
		Not bad.  I just won the State 
		Lottery.

				TYRON
			(not listening to Truman's 
			 reply)
		Good.  Good.

				TRUMAN
		Tyron, what if I said I didn't want 
		meatball today?

				TYRON
			(not missing a beat, 
			 passing Truman his 
			 wrapped sandwich)
		I'd ask for identification.

	Truman forces a half-smile and exits.

				TYRONE
		See you tomorrow, Truman.

				TRUMAN
		You can count on it.

	EXT.  SECLUDED PARK - DAY

	TRUMAN eats lunch alone at a small, out-of-the-way park 
	dominated by a gazebo.  From his briefcase he pulls out an 
	old, hardcovered book, "To The Ends Of The Earth -- The Age 
	Of Exploration." He reads to himself, his sandwich uneaten 
	besides him.  Struck by a particular passage, he reads aloud.

				TRUMAN
		"With a mutiny but half-repressed and 
		starvation imminent, he pressed 
		southward till he found the long-
		hoped-for straits..."

	Truman is interrupted by a TRANSIENT in a wheelchair.  It is 
	the man's sneakers Truman notices first, over the top of his 
	book -- they are distinctively initialed, "T.  S." Still 
	under the spell of the account of Magellan, he hands the 
	grateful man his sandwich.

	INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY

	A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around a 
	circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting 
	room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center 
	of the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings 
	and one of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks 
	up.

				MAN
		Hello?... I'm sorry, I've got more 
		than enough life insurance.

	He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again.

	INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

	TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.

				TRUMAN
			(into receiver)
		... this isn't about insurance, this 
		is about the great variable -- when 
		will death occur?  Could be a week, a 
		month, a year.  Could happen today... 
		A sunbather, minding his own business, 
		gets stabbed in the heart by the tip 
		of a runaway beach umbrella... No way 
		you can guard against that kind of 
		thing, no way at all...

	The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with Truman's 
	pitch, hangs up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than 
	Truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, 
	appears around the corner of the cubicle.

				LAWRENCE
			(handing Truman some 
			 documentation)
		Hey, Burbank, I've got a prospect in 
		Welles Park I need you to close.

	Truman's face falls.  He stares out of his third floor window 
	at the hazy skyline of a nearby island across the bay.

				TRUMAN
			(referring to the island)
		Welles Park on Harbor Island?

				LAWRENCE
			(sarcastic)
		You know another one?

				TRUMAN
		I can't do it.
			(searching for a plausible 
			 excuse)
		-- I've got an appointment, er, 
		dentist.

				LAWRENCE
			(insistent)
		You'll lose a lot more than your 
		teeth if you don't meet your quota, 
		Burbank.
			(the threat in his voice 
			 is unmistakable)
		They're making cutbacks at the end of 
		the month.  You need this.
			(as he exits the cubicle)
		Besides, a half hour across the bay.  
		Sea air.  Do you good.

	Truman sinks back into his seat and stares out at the distant 
	skyline.  The buildings appear very still.  Truman picks up a 
	photo of his wife, Meryl, deposits it in his briefcase and 
	exits.

	EXT.  SEAHAVEN - DAY

	Truman's car heads out of the city on its way to the ferry.

	INT.  SEAHAVEN FERRY TERMINAL - DAY

	TRUMAN exits his car.  Mustering all his nerve, he marches 
	into the Seahaven terminal and buys a token for the ferry.

	Out of his hearing, TWO FERRY WORKERS observe Truman's 
	agitated behavior.

				FERRY WORKER 1
		I got a feeling this is the day.

				FERRY WORKER 2
		No way.  I say he makes it through 
		the turnstiles but he never gets on.

	The two men shake on the wager.  Unaware of the scrutiny, 
	Truman passes through the turnstiles with a herd of TOURISTS 
	and COMMUTERS.  He makes his way across the terminal, but 
	abruptly pulls up at the gangway.

	As the other PASSENGERS impatiently brush past him onto the 
	boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the 
	scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock.  It 
	triggers a memory in his head.

	PLAYBACK - EXT.  SEAHAVEN HARBOR - DAY

	As always, the flashback appears to play on a television 
	screen.

	SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, wearing a lifejacket, sits alongside 
	his father, KIRK, in a small sailing dinghy, sailing into a 
	stiff breeze.

	A second sail boat circles them.  We observe the father and 
	son from an angle atop the mast of the neighboring vessel.

				TRUMAN
			(shouting above the wind)
		Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go 
		further!

				KIRK
			(shouting back)
		It's getting rough, Truman.

				TRUMAN
			(entreating his father)
		Please!

	Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading 
	towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon.

	INT.  SEAHAVEN FERRY TERMINAL - DAY - PRESENT

	Truman turns and begins to fight his way back against the 
	tide of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back onto the 
	street, gasping for air.  The FERRY WORKERS settle their 
	wager.

	EXT.  ROADWAY ADJACENT TO THE FERRY TERMINAL - DAY

	TRUMAN stands at a payphone.  By stretching the payphone's 
	receiver cord as far as it will go, he is able to reach his 
	arm and leg into the driver's door of his car.  He punctuates 
	his conversation with blasts on the car's horn while revving 
	the car's engine with his outstretched foot.  The few passing 
	MOTORISTS and PEDESTRIANS regard Truman curiously.

				TRUMAN
			(shouting into phone)
		I tell you the traffic's insane.
			(blasting his horn 
			 several times to 
			 imitate the sound 
			 of gridlock)
		... I'll never make the ferry in 
		time.  What can I do?  What?... 
		Lawrence, I can't hear you!

	Truman hangs up the phone.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR - DAY

	On his way home, a large "DETOUR" sign forces him onto a 
	secondary road.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR - PARKLAND, SEAHAVEN - DAY

	TRUMAN drives along a winding road through parkland.  He pulls 
	up at a red light -- no other traffic around.  His attention 
	is caught by an attractive YOUNG WOMAN, sitting on a park 
	bench not far from the intersection.  She is being taunted by 
	TWO THUGS.  She attempts to ignore the youths by concentrating 
	on the book on her lap.

				YOUTH 1
			(to woman)
		You wanna read to me?

	His companion smirks.

				YOUTH 1
			(more insistent)
		You wanna read to me?

	The boy reaches over and snatches the novel from that grasp.

				YOUTH 2
			(menacing)
		My friend asked you a question.

	The woman picks up her bag in a reflex and holds it to her.  
	She looks about for assistance, briefly catching Truman's eye.  
	The youths also look in Truman's direction, staring him down.

				WOMAN
			(reaching for the book)
		Please...

	The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so 
	rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his 
	shirt pocket.

				YOUTH 2
		Now you're gonna have to ask me how 
		it ends.

	One of the youths grabs the woman, dragging her toward the 
	surrounding woods.

				YOUTH 1
		We're gonna tell you how it ends, 
		baby.

				WOMAN
		Help!  Please help!

	As they drag towards the undergrowth, Truman, horrified, half 
	gets out of the car -- fearful of his own safety as much as 
	the woman's.  Truman shouts to the youths, his voice cracking 
	with fear.

				TRUMAN
		Hey!  Let her go!

	A huge truck suddenly appears behind Truman's car, its horn 
	blasting, the DRIVER hurling abuse.  Truman hesitates as the 
	youths drag the woman into the bushes, conflicted over whether 
	or not to help.  The truck driver keeps his hand on the horn.  
	Truman retreats back into his car and reluctantly drives on.

	EXT.  PARKLAND - WOODS - DAY

	Truman's car safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release 
	the YOUNG WOMAN.  She calmly brushes herself off, no longer 
	afraid.  The young men, no longer angry, retrieve her bag.

				WOMAN
		Thanks.

	The threesome walks back towards the roadway as if life-long 
	friends.

				WOMAN
			(pointing the incident)
		He did nothing.

				YOUTH 1
			(shrugs, suddenly 
			 more cough)
		Physical violence paralyzes him.  
		Always has.

	EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - DUSK

	Beyond the pretty picket fence at the end of the property 
	flows a busy highway.

	TRUMAN is mowing the lawn.  From his expression it would seem 
	that he's still reflecting on his inaction in the park.  He 
	switches off the mower and leans on the handle.

	He is distracted by the arrival of his wife, MERYL, exiting 
	the house.  She wears a nurse's uniform and carries a curious 
	metal device attached to a card board backing.  She kisses 
	Truman affectionately on the cheek.

				MERYL
		Hi, honey.  Look at this.
			(proudly referring to 
			 the device)
		It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer 
		and peeler in one.  Never needs 
		sharpening.  Dishwasher safe.

				TRUMAN
		Gee, that's great.

	Looking over Truman's shoulder, Meryl notices a small, uncut 
	patch of grass missed by Truman in one of his passes.

				MERYL
			(referring to the uncut 
			 grass)
		You missed a section.

	Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and 
	obediently pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As 
	the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass, 
	Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for 
	Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	MERYL is removing the cap of her nurse's uniform when TRUMAN 
	enters.

				TRUMAN
		How did it go today?

				MERYL
			(matter-of-fact)
		A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.
			(shrugs)
		We got three of his fingers back on.

	Truman retrieves a bucket of golf balls and a golf club from 
	behind the door.

				MERYL
			(disappointed at the sight 
			 of the golf equipment)
		I was hoping we could have a special 
		evening.

				TRUMAN
		I won't be late.

				MERYL
			(sensing something odd 
			 in his demeanor)
		Did something happen today?

	Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.

				TRUMAN
		What could happen?

	Truman exits.

	EXT.  UNFINISHED BRIDGE - NIGHT

	A half-constructed bridge, paved but unmarked, ends abruptly 
	in mid-air -- reinforcing steel protruding from the concrete.  
	TRUMAN stands at the end of the unfinished bridge with MARLON, 
	thirties, a well-filled physique.  Marlon drinks beer from a 
	can while Truman addresses a teed-up golf ball with a number 
	three wood.  The headlights of their two parked cars far end 
	of the bridge proclaiming, "THE SEAHAVEN CAUSEWAY -- Linking 
	Seahaven Island With The Rest Of The World -- Your Tax Dollars 
	At Work" -- an upturned plastic cone at the foot of the sign 
	is the "hole."

	Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the 
	ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky.  From a new 
	angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of 
	the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt beyond 
	the sign.

	Marlon tosses Truman another off-white ball from a bucket of 
	badly scarred golf balls.  Truman sets the ball up on the 
	makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot.  
	With a slight fade, the second ball carries even further than 
	the first.

				MARLON
		Whose nuts were those?

	Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.  
	Marlon tees up a ball of his own He uses orange golf balls.

				TRUMAN
		I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.

				MARLON
			(mild interest only)
		Yeah?  Outta what?

				TRUMAN
		Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off 
		this island... out!

	Marlon takes a practice swing.

				MARLON
		Outta your job?  What the hell's 
		wrong with your job?  You gotta great 
		job.  You gotta desk job.  I'd kill 
		for a desk job.

	Marlon addresses the ball and swings -- a sweeping hook shot 
	that bounces off the freeway and into the water hazard.

				MARLON
			(annoyed by the errant 
			 tee shot)
		Sonofabitch.
			(still looking in the 
			 direction of his ball)
		Try stocking vending machines for a 
		living.  My biggest decision of the 
		day is whether the Almond Joys look 
		better next to the Snickers of the 
		Baby Ruths.

	Truman selects another "M" ball from the bucket and tosses it 
	to Marlon.

				TRUMAN
			(adamant)
		Haven't you ever gotten itchy feet?

	Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball 
	in the other direction.  A lucky bounce keeps it on the "green." 
	The ball rolls in the direction of the upturned cone.

				MARLON
			(skeptical, picking 
			 up his beer)
		Where is there to go?

	Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.

				TRUMAN
			(unable to disguise 
			 his reverence)
		Fiji.

	Marlon considers Truman's suggestion as he sips his beer.

				MARLON
			(impressed)
		Fiji?  Where the hell is Fiji 
		exactly?  Near Florida?  You can't 
		drive there, can you?

	Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.  He points to a 
	dimple on his make-shift globe.

				TRUMAN
		See here, this is us.
			(sliding his finger 
			 around the other 
			 side of the ball)
		All the way round here, Fiji.  You 
		can't get any further away before 
		you start coming back.
			(tossing the world in 
			 his hand, warming to 
			 his subject)
		Y'know, there are still islands in 
		Fiji where no human has ever set 
		foot.

				MARLON
			(still dubious)
		So when are you leaving?

				TRUMAN
		It's not that simple.  Takes money, 
		planning.  You can't just up and go.
			(heading off Marlon's 
			 skepticism)
		Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry 
		about that.  I've just got to move 
		slow.  Pick my movement.  Bonus 
		time's just around the corner.  
		Soon as I finish the...

				MARLON
		Nursery?

				TRUMAN
		Spare room -- I can start thinking 
		about selling up... and I'll be 
		gone.  Up and away on that big 
		steel bird.
			(as if to convince himself)
		I'm going, don't you worry about 
		that.

	Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond 
	his imagination.

				MARLON
		I never knew anybody who wanted to 
		leave Seahaven.

	An awkward moment.  Truman, once again, not so sure of himself.

	INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

	A MAN looks up sharply.  He stares into camera.  CHRISTOF, 
	late fifties -- a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.  
	A news anchor-style earpiece disappears down the neck of his 
	suit.

	EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

	TRUMAN and MARLON wander along the empty bridge, retrieving 
	the golf balls.

	Marlon goes to say something to the disconsolate Truman, but 
	is momentarily distracted.  He raises his hand to his ear.  
	Truman places another of the balls in the bucket.

				MARLON
		Truman, you know, I did think about 
		moving away one time.

				TRUMAN
			(interest piqued)
		Yeah, what happened?

				MARLON
		I figured, what's the point?  I 
		knew I'd just be taking my problems 
		with me.  Once the kids came along, 
		it made me look at Seahaven with 
		new eyes.
			(gazing out at the 
			 lights of Seahaven)
		I realized, what the hell could be 
		better than this?
			(putting a hand on 
			 Truman's shoulder)
		I'm telling you.  What you really 
		need is someone to carry on the 
		"Burbank" name.

				TRUMAN
		You think so?

				MARLON
		Trust me.

	Marlon picks up the last ball at the mouth of the upturned 
	cone.  The ball is white.

				MARLON
			(checking the ball)
		You win.

	They approach Truman's car.  Truman opens the trunk to deposit 
	their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains of the 
	fallen light fixture.

				TRUMAN
			(referring to the light)
		You really think it could've 
		dropped off an airliner?

				MARLON
			(unimpressed)
		Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it 
		didn't hit you -- you could've 
		sued.
			(quickly changing the subject)
		You coming for a drink?

				TRUMAN
		I can't tonight.

	INT.  LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

	From the POV of the lighthouse's lantern room, we observe 
	TRUMAN sitting on the beach staring out to sea.

	Closer on Truman.  He has a portable tape recorder slung over 
	his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf.  We 
	watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the 
	lapping waves.  The lamp from the lighthouse occasionally 
	falls upon Truman.

	PLAYBACK - EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

	As always, the flashback appears to play on a television 
	screen.

	The sky is black with storm clouds.  Gale force winds lash 
	rain into the faces of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and his father, 
	KIRK.  As Kirk stands up to get his hearings, a freak gust of 
	wind catches the sail.  The boom whips across the stern and 
	strikes Kirk flush in the head, knocking his overboard.

	Truman, wearing the sole lifejacket, desperately reaches for 
	his father.  He momentarily has hold of his hold of his 
	father's hand when Kirk is abruptly dragged beneath the 
	surface.

				TRUMAN
			(crying out)
		Daddy!!  Daddy!!

	His cries go unanswered.  Seven-year-old Truman finds himself 
	alone -- the storm abruptly passed, the wind suddenly dropped, 
	the water stilled.

	The frightened Truman examines the ring he holds in his open 
	hand -- his father's ring -- wrenched from his finger in 
	Truman's fight to keep him afloat.

	EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - PRESENT

	A close up of TRUMAN from KIRK'S RING that Truman now wears.

	Then, from the lighthouse POV, we observe Truman get to his 
	feet and walk towards the dark water.  He stands at the 
	water's edge.

				TRUMAN
			(shouting at the surf)
		I'm sorry, Dad!  I'm sorry!

	As if in reply, a tongue of lightning flashes across the 
	distant skyline, followed by a growl of thunder.

	INT.  A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

	TWO OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside each other on a sofa 
	looking directly into camera as they talk.

				OLD WOMAN 1
			(playing amateur psychiatrist)
		It left him with more than his 
		obvious fear of the water.

				OLD WOMAN 2
		He was never the same curious 
		little boy again.

				OLD WOMAN 1
		Half the women I know named their 
		children after him.

	EXT.  BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	TRUMAN is forced to leg it through a sudden rain shower to his 
	car.

	From Truman's point-of-view, the shower appears quite normal.  
	However, viewed from a distance, we see that the shower is 
	extremely localized, encircling only him, as if a small cloud 
	is directly above his head, tracking his progress.

	As Truman crosses the parking lot, the shower crosses with him.  
	Sensing something amiss, Truman dances back and force across 
	the street, intrigued by the curious phenomenon.  He hums a 
	few bars of "Singin' In The Rain."

	The rain becomes heavier, covering a wider area.  Truman runs 
	the remaining distance to his car.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - NURSERY - NIGHT

	The drenched TRUMAN enters to find MERYL, in the unfinished 
	nursery, comparing wallpaper samples.  Meryl wears a robe, a 
	glimpse of black negligee beneath.

				MERYL
		Where have you been?

				TRUMAN
			(wringing out his jacket)
		I've been thinking--

				MERYL
			(rolling her eyes)
		Oh, God.

				TRUMAN
			(ignoring the reception)
		-- I figure we could scrape 
		together eight thousand.

				MERYL
			(exasperated)
		Every time you and Marlon --

				TRUMAN
		-- we could bum around the world 
		for a year on that.

				MERYL
		And then what, Truman?  We'd be 
		back to where we were five years 
		ago.  You're talking like a 
		teenager.

				TRUMAN
		Maybe I feel like a teenager.

				MERYL
		We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, 
		Truman.  There's the car payments.  
		After we just going to walk away 
		from our financial obligations?

	Truman, still dripping on the floor, holds Meryl by the arms.  
	He talks excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they 
	were courting.

				TRUMAN
		It'd be an adventure.

				MERYL
		I thought we were going to try for 
		a baby.  Isn't that enough of an 
		adventure?

				TRUMAN
		That can wait.  I want to get away.  
		See some of the world.  Explore.

	Meryl gives a derisive laugh.

				MERYL
		You want to be an explorer?  You 
		don't even have a passport, 
		Truman.  I bet you don't even know 
		how to get one.

	The words sting.  Truman turns away.  Seeing the pain she's 
	caused, she changes tack.

				MERYL
		This'll pass.  Everybody thinks 
		like this now and then.
			(making an attempt at 
			 seduction)
		Come to bed.

				TRUMAN
		I think I'm going to stay up for a 
		while.

	INT.  AN OFFICE BUILDING SOMEWHERE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

	In the reception area of an office building, TWO UNINFORMED 
	GUARDS drink coffee.

				GUARD 1
		How can they have a child?

				GUARD 2
		It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

				GUARD 1
		Why not?

				GUARD 2
		You think she'd go through with it?

				GUARD 1
		Sure she would.

				GUARD 2
			(reassessing his own opinion)
		Guess I always thought they'd 
		adopt.

	EXT.  TRUMAN'S STREET - DAWN

	There is something peculiar about the way the sun rises over 
	Seahaven Island -- the light appears in an arc that's slightly 
	too perfect and well-defined.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	In front of his bedroom window, TRUMAN, wearing his new sweats, 
	performs an exercise routine of his own invention.  He counts 
	off the exercises to himself -- cheating as he does so.  He 
	counts five leg-lifts for every two he completes.

				TRUMAN
		-- Five...
			(tow leg-lifting later)
		Then... fifteen... two more makes 
		twenty.

	INT.  A BEDROOM SOMEWHERE -- MORNING

	A middle-aged MARRIED COUPLE in identical matching sweats 
	repeat the same eccentric exercises in perfect sync, as if 
	they were in a class led by Truman.

	EXT.  CAR -- DAY

	TRUMAN climbs into the car and switches on the radio.  He 
	drives down the street.

				RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Another glorious morning in 
		Seahaven, folks.  Don't forget to 
		buckle up--

	Truman mutters to himself as is his custom.

	EXT.  DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN -- DAY

	TRUMAN emerges from the parking lot and as usual stops at the 
	newspaper stand.  He picks up a glossy magazine and flips 
	through the cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing a pair of 
	EYES from one of the pages.  He returns the magazine to the 
	rack.  As usual, the NEWSPAPER VENDOR fails to intervene.  
	Truman begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush 
	hour pedestrian traffic.

	As he enters the street leading to his office, he glimpses a 
	HOMELESS MAN reflected in the window of a parked car.  Truman, 
	spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels around to face him.  
	The Homeless Man, late-fifties, more well-groomed and well-fed 
	than the average vagrant, has a serene smile on his face.

	The Homeless Man places his hand ever so gently on Truman's 
	cheek.  Truman makes no effort to withdraw.  He is transfixed 
	by the man's eyes.  He appears to recognize him.

				TRUMAN
			(almost to himself, 
			 mouthing the word)
		Dad...

	Suddenly an ELEGANT WOMAN SHOPPER walking a small WIENER DOG 
	and A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in 
	opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man.  
	One under each arm, lifting the Homeless Man off the ground, 
	they start to whisk the bewildered derelict down the street.

				TRUMAN
			(calling out)
		Stop!  Stop!!

	Truman begins to give chase.  However, the shopper and the 
	businessman are surprisingly fleet-footed.  Even more 
	surprising as Truman embarks on the pursuit is the behavior of 
	the PEDESTRIANS and COMMUTERS.  They appear to part for the 
	fleeing trio, then close ranks in front of him.  Is it 
	accidental, or are the pedestrians working together, running 
	interference?

				TRUMAN
			(shouting at the pedestrians)
		Outta way!  Outta way!

	They are escaping.

	Truman finally breaks through the pack, bowling over several 
	of the pedestrians in the process.  Just as he gets within 
	reach of the shopper and the businessman, a bus suddenly 
	screeches to a halt beside the abductors, doors already open.  
	The Woman Shopper and the Executive bundle the Homeless Man 
	onto the bus.  Truman lurches after them, but he is met by 
	the bus doors, closing sharply in his face.

				TRUMAN
			(to BUS DRIVER)
		Hey, stop!  Stop the bus!!

	Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores 
	his cries and the bus roars away.  The other PASSENGERS in 
	the bus, apparently oblivious to the incident, keeps staring 
	straight ahead.

	Truman continues to give chase when a taxi appears out of 
	nowhere and cuts in front of him, blocking his path.  When he 
	recovers, the bus has disappeared.  The mysterious crowd of 
	pedestrians has also dissolved as if it never existed.

	Retracing his steps, head reeling, wondering if the could have 
	imagined the whole incident, Truman discovers that the Woman 
	Shopper has left her WIENER DOG behind.  The dog wanders 
	aimlessly on the pavement, its leash trailing behind it.

	INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	TRUMAN paces impatiently in the living room of his Mother's 
	cramped, fussy, doilyed little house full of Burbank family 
	memorabilia -- a cluster of framed photographs is dominated by 
	one of his FATHER trimmed with a black ribbon.  A toilet 
	flushes and Truman's MOTHER finally emerges from the next room.

	She presents something of a contradiction.  Although she walks 
	with the aid of a "walker," she is actually a well-preserved 
	sixty.  She wears a glamorous nightgown and a full head of 
	bleached-blonde hair.

				TRUMAN
			(kissing Mother on the cheek)
		How are you, Mother?

				MOTHER
		Well, I made it through another 
		night.

				TRUMAN
		How's your hip?

				MOTHER
		Oh, just so.

	Truman supports Mother.

				MOTHER
		You know surprises aren't good for 
		me.  You should really call before 
		you come over, dear.

				TRUMAN
		I've got something to tell you.  
		You'd better sit down.

	Truman helps her into an overstuffed armchair.

				MOTHER
		You look very pale, Truman.  Are 
		you taking your vitamin D's?

				TRUMAN
			(exasperated)
		I spend half my life out in the 
		sun, Mother, why would I need 
		vitamin D?

				MOTHER
		I feel certain my condition runs 
		in the family.
			(putting the back of her 
			 hand dramatically for 
			 her forehead)
		Can't this wait, dear?

	He kneels beside her.

				TRUMAN
		No, I'm afraid it can't.

	Truman takes a deep breath as he prepares to give her the news.

				TRUMAN
		I know this is going to sound 
		insane, Mother, but... I saw Dad 
		today on Lancaster Circle.  He's 
		alive.

	Mother smiles condescendingly.

				MOTHER
		It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  
		I swear I see him ten times a week 
		-- in a hundred faces.  I almost 
		hugged a perfect stranger in the 
		salon last Thursday.

				TRUMAN
		It was Dad, I swear, dressed like 
		a homeless man.  And you know what 
		else was really strange?  A 
		businessman and a woman with a 
		little dog appeared from nowhere 
		and forced him onto a bus.

				MOTHER
		About time they started cleaning 
		up the trash Downtown.  We don't 
		want to end up like the rest of 
		the country.

				TRUMAN
		They never found Dad's body -- 
		maybe somehow --

				MOTHER
		-- Darling --

				TRUMAN
			(already doubting himself)
		I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, 
		it was his twin.  Did Dad have a 
		brother?

				MOTHER
		You know he was an only child, like 
		you.
			(placing a comforting 
			 arm around him)
		I know how bad you feel about what 
		happened -- sailing into that 
		storm.  But I don't blame you, 
		Truman.  I never have.

	Mother kisses Truman on the cheek.

				MOTHER
			(referring to her platinum 
			 blonde hair)
		I was thinking about going lighter.  
		What do you think?

	Truman regards his Mother.  Her hair is already impossibly 
	blonde.

	INT.  TRUMAN'S BASEMENT - DUSK

	The basement is cluttered with junk -- ships in bottles, a 
	train track without trains, an oxygen mask, a stringless 
	guitar, many abandoned projects.  The basement is dimly lit 
	by a single, naked bulb.  TRUMAN looks over his shoulder 
	before opening a large walk-in cupboard.  On the cupboard door 
	is a wall map of the Pacific Ocean -- the Fiji Islands are 
	carefully circled.  Amongst the many tools and household 
	implements inside the cupboard is a trunk under a dusty 
	canvas sheet.  He pulls the trunk into the room, unfastens 
	the lock and opens the lid.

	Inside, mementoes from his youth.  A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a 
	stack of "GREAT EXPLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a 
	garment in a drycleaning bag.  Truman carefully lifts up the 
	plastic to reveal a young woman's cardigan sweater.  He puts 
	the cardigan to his nose and takes in its scent.

	Footsteps.  Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and 
	shuts the lid.  MERYL's legs appear on the stairs.

				MERYL
		What're you doing down here?

				TRUMAN
			(turning attention to an 
			 upturned mower on the 
			 basement floor)
		Fixing the mower.
			(matter-of-fact)
		I saw my father today.

				MERYL
		I know.

				TRUMAN
			(suspicious)
		How do you know?

				MERYL
		Your mother called.  You shouldn't 
		upset her like that.

	Meryl's response takes the wind out of Truman's sails.

				TRUMAN
		What did you want?

				MERYL
		I made macaroni.

				TRUMAN
		I'm not hungry.

	Meryl nods, not at all convinced.

				MERYL
		We really ought to toss that mower 
		out.  Get one of those new Elk 
		Rotaries.

	Truman does not reply.  After an uncomfortable pause, she 
	turns back up the stairs.

	Truman waits a moment before re-opening the trunk.  He removes 
	the cardigan and holds it up, reminiscing.

	INT.  A KITCHEN SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

	A MOTHER, DAUGHTER about 12, and a BABY in a highchair stare 
	into camera.

				DAUGHTER
		What's he doing?

				MOTHER
		They removed all physical trace of her 
		but they couldn't erase the memory.

				DAUGHTER
		The memory of who?

				MOTHER
			(finger to lips)
		Shhh!

	PLAYBACK MONTAGE - EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - STEPS - DAY

	Once again the images appear to be playing on a television 
	screen.

	On the steps of a typical college campus, TRUMAN, 21, in a 
	college band uniform, participates in a football pep rally.  
	MARLON, 21, a member of the football team, and MERYL, 21, a 
	cheerleader, are nearby.  Truman observes an ethereal-looking 
	young woman walk by -- LAUREN.

	PLAYBACK - INT.  DANCEHALL - NIGHT

	At a college dance, TRUMAN dances with MERYL.  LAUREN dances 
	by with a PARTNER of her own.  However, Truman only has eyes 
	for Lauren.  Suddenly, she is escorted from the dance floor.

	PLAYBACK - EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - STREET - DAY

	TRUMAN almost trips off the curb as he waves to LAUREN, riding 
	towards him on a bicycle.  However, she rides right by with 
	her nose in the air, not even acknowledging his presence -- 
	Truman puzzled by her change of heart.

	The montage ends at a scene in a college library.
