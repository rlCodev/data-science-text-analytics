INT - POLICE CAR - MIRA/PAVEL - NIGHT

MIRA
(Subtitles)
Why are there still such headlines?

PAVEL
(Subtitles)
This press we cannot control.
Americans, I think.

MIRA
(Subtitles)
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel.
Where are you storing the personnel files?

PAVEL
(Subtitles)
In a building belonging to the
University in the Old Town.

MIRA
(Subtitles)
You are quite sure it's secure?

PAVEL
(Subtitles)
The files are in a sealed room and the
University are under strict orders to
stay away.

MIRA
(Subtitles)
The storage facility will be ready
within a week, I'll call you then.

Pavel nods and Mira taps the Driver on the shoulder. Mira takes a 
envelope out of his inside pocket and hands it to Pavel.


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - PAVEL/MIRA/DRIVER - NIGHT

Show the police car pull up. Across the road is the "ROKOKO_ 
nightclub with neon sign. Mira climbs out of the car. The police car 
drives off. Mira crosses the street away from Rokoko. Show the

casually walk past the club.


INT - NIGHTCLUB - DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS/JOSH/HOLLY - NIGHT

A poetry evening is in progress in the dimly lit lounge of Rokoko 
nightclub. At the front-centre of the lounge is an overhead red lamp 
and a bar stool, beside which is standing Lawrence.

(Lawrence: Hip-looking American in early-twenties)

LAWRENCE
....... and yes she wore your bathing
suit, clad and clinging round her sex
and yes I thought of you, when you
were still a bubble of breath and
hope and love,

Show trendy young Western people conversing in groups and drinking 
wine & beer. It is crowded with all couches occupied and many people 
lying/sitting on the floor. To one side is a PHOTOGRAPHER and 
ASSISTANT with equipment set up.

LAWRENCE(OS)
for those that died and never lied;
to your face or heaving breasts
I dream of nightly between damp sheets,
as I run from you and think of Joleen.

Show audience's enthusiastic applause. Katka weaves through the crowd 
carrying two beers and a cocktail. A young MAN blocks her path 
momentarily and they exchange smiles as she passes by.

(Katka: 19yr-old beautiful Czech girl)

ON LAWRENCE
LAWRENCE
Okay....The next one I'd like to share
with you is called, "Revisited."

A camera flashes. Lawrence blinks a few times, shaking his head as he 
thumbs through loose papers, dropping one. Show the Photographer 
working with equipment.

LAWRENCE (OS) 
Old Town Square a maze of cafes
Change shops offer souvenirs
Moving-walks span Charles Bridge
Charging a dollar a ride
Fairy tale castle on the hill
Licensed to Disneyland
And occupied by a dreamer
Directing from an ivory tower
Built from sweat, tears and fear
LAWRENCE (Cont_d)
As part of his inheritance
Not content with money and mortar
Pen, paper and wife
To carry on and tell the tale
He must aspire to greater things

Follow Katka back to a couch and table where DOUG and CHRIS are 
sitting.

(Doug: 30yr-old Englishman with rugged, good looks)
(Chris: 24yr-old American, overweight)

Their table is a mess of empty beer bottles, half-full ash tray & 
Czech cigarettes. Chris is playing with a baseball. Doug finishes 
off a beer and grabs one of the new beers brought by Katka.


FADE LAWRENCE TO BACKGROUND SOUND

DOUG
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.

KATKA
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!

DOUG
(to Chris)
I think he's jealous of Havel.

CHRIS
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.

DOUG
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!

ANGLE a female audience member who is enthraled.

ON LAWRENCE
LAWRENCE (Cont'd)
And from the dungeon climb
To take a place still warm
Exchanging iron clasps for gold
Rags for riches
Stories yet to scribe for him

A camera flashes.

LAWRENCE(Cont'd)
King of scribes
Were it a monarchy, but no
He must preside
Over and over again
A nation of ungodly saints
Born again with time to die
The death of a thousand evils
And by their hand they'll claim
Others guided a destiny once more

Enthusiastic applause and yells, some people clapping. Lawrence moves 
off centre. M.C. gets up from a nearby couch and goes to the front 
and checks his clipboard.

(M.C: Slight-figured American in early-twenties with goatee)

M.C.
Great piece Lawrence. Okay next up is... 
Holly.

ANGLE Holly and Josh sitting at a table on which are two glasses of 
wine & Western cigarettes. Holly rises from her seat and moves past 
Josh.

(Holly: 27yr-old American girl with understated looks)
(Josh: All-American guy in early thirties)

FOLLOW Holly down to the front as M.C. moves off. Holly sits on the 
bar stool back under the red light.

HOLLY
I'd like to read some prose, it doesn't
have a title yet.

Holly flicks through her notebook.

ANGLE DOUG/CHRIS/KATKA
DOUG
(to Chris)
Here comes her life story all twenty
something years of it.

CHRIS
Let's hope it don't take that long to
read.

HOLLY
As the dawn brings the sun and life to
her body made limp by sleep and the
pleasures of his passion she awakes, and
feels her nakedness against the world and
his body lying still, next to her. Stained
bed sheet and a pillow, heavy from sweat,
are all that remains to validate his
valour in night time combat. But she was
not his foe, that unseen enemy he forced
his might against last night; she was but a
cushion for his blows. 


ANGLE DOUG\KATKA\CHRIS & FADE HOLLY SOUND TO BACKGROUND

HOLLY(OS)
No act of love but willing violence
demanded by one and begged by the other.
As life turned to fantasy and reality to
ecstasy a need, so deep no light could
reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature
unearthed for momentary and glorious
display. Left alone in a rose-tinted
afterglow dimming fast she tasted the
moisture of her body and wondered why
light came to day and such desires to
her pale-skin body.

DOUG
(to Chris)
Well she sure isn't normal.

CHRIS
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!

DOUG
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.

KATKA
So why don't you get up and speak something,
then we will see who is crazy.

DOUG
Ooh, well excuse me.

ON HOLLY
HOLLY
And now as the window lace filters out
a darkened past she reaches for her body
once more. Her hand glides from breast
to thigh as thoughts of times flow by.
Her nipples awake and race after a conscious
thought of lustful moments in grassy fields
in time to see reality reap the earth and
leave it barren.


ANGLE DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS

Doug drinks, Chris smokes and Katka listens. PAN Audience.

HOLLY(OS)
She has no reason for discontent and
less for hope of what love could be
in a privileged world. Her eyes wander
once more and her hand follows, down his
spine. The nails that hide no blood run
down the valley of his buttocks, stroking
electric hairs that lead to his well of
life and reason. As the tendons in
her fingers tighten her Adonis wakes
and her eyes turn to the sky and a
life through netted curtains.

Holly closes notebook and tentative applause begins as she moves back 
to Josh who is clapping politely

JOSH
When the hell did you write that?

HOLLY
Just yesterday.

JOSH
Shit Honey, you could've told me.
People might think it's about us!

HOLLY
Maybe it is!

ANGLE M.C. up front.
M.C.
Okay let's take a break there...

M.C. looks at the clipboard.

M.C.(Cont'd)
We've only got three readers for the
second half so sign-up in the break
if you're interested - Does anyone
have any announcements to make?

A few acknowledgments are heard and a wildly-dressed American girl 
named ANN comes up front and the M.C. moves to one side.

ANN
I'm looking for an apartment, my name's
Ann and I'd appreciate any leads, thanks!

Ann scurries off. ANGLE a GIRL getting up from a small group of bulky 
young ladies.

GIRL
Can I just say....We're looking for
nude males for our live art drawing
classes on Wednesday afternoon, if
anyone's interested talk to us - there's
no money but plenty of vegie food and wine.

Cat-calls and laughs from the audience as the Girl sits down.

M.C.
Anything else?

ANGLE JOSH
JOSH
Yeah!........................
I'd just like to repeat last weeks note
about the upcoming deadline for entries
in "Reflections", the American Centre's
yearly expose of Western culture here.
If any of you think you're good enough
and would like to see some of your stuff
in print, just see me, Josh.

Show lack of audience interest.
M.C.
That it? Okay, let's take fifteen.

ANGLE audience members getting up and heading to the bar and mingling.

ON DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS.
DOUG
There you go Chris, do a bit of
modelling on the side.

CHRIS
No way, you wouldn't catch me with
a rose between my teeth and my pants
in the next room.

DOUG
What is it with that Josh guy? Who
does he think he is shoving that
Reflections rag down our throats?

CHRIS
Son of the American ambassador and a
banker - good enough?

DOUG
Wanker more like, what does he know
about writing.

Doug finishes off his beer.

CHRIS
How to make a buck!

DOUG
Yeah right!....I don't know, something
isn't right with this place, it's all
too sterile and staged. Do you ever
wonder why there's no Czechs here?

CHRIS
Because it's in English?

DOUG
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the
Czech mind, any movement, whether
political or literary should be
underground. If it isn't, then it's
not radical and not worthy of a look-in.

CHRIS
But we are underground?

DOUG
No you don't get it. Every cabby in
town knows this joint. So where's the
mystery, the danger?

KATKA
Why don't you read something after the
break?
DOUG
What here? Weren't you listening to
what I just said?

KATKA
You used to read. 

DOUG
Well not any more, now I'm a serious
writer and above this crap.

CHRIS
Yeah, very serious and very part-time.


DOUG
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't
realise you had it till it's gone.

CHRIS
And not even then sometimes.

KATKA
That's true Doug, writers are supposed
to write.

CHRIS
And pay for their drinks occasionally.

DOUG
You guys having a go a me or what?

CHRIS
We're only joking.....It is your round
though!

DOUG
Well, this place is too expensive so
you've had it.

KATKA
Doug, that's not nice.
You had some money earlier?

Katka gets some money out of a purse.

KATKA
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.

DOUG
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's
split. I can't stand this any more,
it's murdering my respect for literature.

KATKA
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.

DOUG
How about you Brutus?

CHRIS
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.

DOUG
You're outnumbered Kat two to one,
got to go with the majority, that's
democracy.

Doug, Katka and Chris gather their belongings and meander through the 
crowded audience to the exit. ANGLE Josh arguing with Holly.

JOSH
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing
past me for Christ's sake before you
get up and broadcast the crap.

HOLLY
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!

EXT - PRAGUE STREETS - DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS - NIGHT

They stand at a crossroads away from the nightclub.

DOUG
So what's it going to be, Coogan's
or U Vayvudoo?

KATKA
I don't care. I'm not staying out
late Doug.

CHRIS
What about that squat bar you showed me,
is that open on a Sunday?

DOUG
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.

Chris starts to walk with Doug but Katka stands still. Doug turns.

KATKA
I think I'll go home.

Doug moves close to Katka

DOUG
Come on Kat we'll just have a couple of
drinks. I can't just leave Chris on
his own!

Doug embraces Katka.

KATKA
I'm not staying out late and
I can't come back to your place.

DOUG
Whatever!

The three of them walk briskly through Prague's Old Town streets and 
alleys. They cross a tram line. Show tram stop and a corner clock, 
time is now 8.10 pm. Chris offers Doug a cigarette and they share 
Doug's zippo lighter. Doug breaks away to check a rubbish skip.

CHRIS
Anything in it?

DOUG
No, just crap. I want some picture
frames.

CHRIS
Never heard of K-MART?

SHOW a building under refurbishment for Western client.


DOUG
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois
traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech
earns.

CHRIS
Yeah and they manage to go to
bourgeois joints!

An old LADY passes by walking a small DOG. A Tram passes with Western 
cigarette advertising.

DOUG
It all comes down to ideology and
they've lost theirs. If I'd been
here ten years ago, maybe they
wouldn't be in the mess they are today.

CHRIS
What's that? Free!

DOUG
Just because they've got a choice of four
McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a
cheeseburger.

CHRIS
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is
a little work.

KATKA
Maybe you should try working more and
show us Czechs how it's done.

Doug moves from Katka and puts his arm around Chris.

DOUG
A word of advice my celibate friend.
These Czech girls look like dynamite
and go like it, but don't be fooled;
there's a price to be paid and it's
going up fast. Right Kat?

KATKA
What?

DOUG
You're everything a guy could want.

Doug kisses Katka. They turn down a narrow street with some boarded 
up buildings and cut through an alleyway into another street. They 
approach an old decrepid apartment building, some windows dimly lit 
above. Faint rock music. They pass through the heavy main door into 
a dark passage and enter a bar.


INT - SQUAT BAR - DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS - NIGHT

Well-lit, moderately loud music and much smoke. Rough-looking bar is 
at one end of a room with some tables and benches set up. Occupants 
are social dregs. Doug, Katka and Chris move to the bar.

DOUG
I love it! Freedom of expression
suppressed by mental paralysis.

Doug recognises someone and goes to talk with him.

CHRIS
(to Katka)
What are you having?

KATKA
A coke, if they have it?

CHRIS
Hey Doug, you want a beer?

ANGLE Doug shaking hands with LUBOSH nearby and turns to Chris.

(Lubosh: Czech scraggy-haired man in thirties)

DOUG
Yeah, what else?

ANGLE some occupants of bar. Chris hands a coke to Katka and gives 
Doug a beer.

CHRIS
Cheers Katka!

KATKA
Naz dravi!.....What do you like
about this place, these people, Chris?

CHRIS
I don't know. It's kind of
underground. Doug's right, there's
too much crap in this town.

KATKA
I used to think he was right about a
lot of things but now I don't know.
I thought he was going somewhere but
now I think I am wasting my time.

CHRIS
No, you guys are great together.
He'll come through, I'm sure.

ANGLE Doug rejoining Katka and Chris.

CHRIS
Who's your friend?

DOUG
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle
player in Prague. You must have seen
him playing with Johnny on the bridge.
......Come on, let's grab a table.

FOLLOW Doug, Katka and Chris to a table with black tablecloth and 
suspended light above. ANGLE two guys smoking dope at the other end 
of the table. Doug glances at the dope smokers.

DOUG
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!

DOUG
What did the beer cost?

CHRIS
Fifteen crowns.

DOUG
This place is getting expensive too,
used to be twelve.

CHRIS
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.

Doug looks at label on beer bottle. ANGLE a teenage BOY strumming on 
a guitar in the corner while his GIRLFRIEND plays with a PUPPY.

DOUG
You know this place could be the answer
to what we've been looking for.

Chris spins his signed, commemorative baseball around.

CHRIS
Oh yeah, what's that?

DOUG
An alternative literary venue!

CHRIS
I ain't sure poetry will go down too
well here.

DOUG
No, it's the whole idea behind it.
How did they get this place? 

CHRIS
Squatted it.

DOUG
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his
mates took the whole freakin' building.

CHRIS
So?
DOUG
Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why
don't we get one?

Chris checks Katka with a glance.

CHRIS
We? Doug they're Czech you're not.
You can't go taking people's property.

Doug takes a cigarette from Chris's pack and lights it up.

DOUG
What we need is a space for real performance
art. A cultural exchange for radical
expressionism.

CHRIS
You've got to stop using that word "we"
it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?

KATKA
It's just talk, he's drunk.

DOUG
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for
something - this could be it!

CHRIS
He's not drunk, he's crazy.

DOUG
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.

CHRIS
Like Custer huh?

DOUG
These guys think the West is just MTV
and Hollywood movies. We've got to show
them there's more to it.

Chris turns to Katka
CHRIS
There's "we" again. Do you think
he means us?

Katka shakes head and takes a drink.

DOUG
I've got to talk to Lubosh and get a
handle on this.

FOLLOW Doug walking over to Lubosh who is talking with JAHN.

(Jahn: Czech man early twenties)

ON KATKA/CHRIS with DOUG/LUBOSH/JAHN in SHOT.

CHRIS
So how's your work?

KATKA
It's okay, they're training me on the
cash register and after I hope to work
on one of the jewellery counters.

CHRIS
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's
serious about squatting a place?

KATKA
I don't know, I don't care. I see too
much of him and he's changed. He used
to be busy at the magazine. But now he's
been doing nothing for months, like he
doesn't care about anything, including me.

CHRIS
Well, he sure seems fired up all of
a sudden.

KATKA
It won't last, believe me. And you,
when will you go back to the States?

CHRIS
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for
postgrad' studies next Autumn.

ON KATKA/CHRIS
KATKA
Did you ever see Marketa again?

CHRIS
No, she's a great girl but I couldn't
keep up with her. Thanks for trying
but I think I'll stay single for now.

KATKA
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a
nice girl.

CHRIS
Like you?

KATKA
No, better than me. You know, I have
many friends, you should meet more of
them.

Doug returns to the table with Jahn.

DOUG
Jahn, this is my girlfriend Katka
and an American friend, Chris Freeman.

Doug and Jahn sit down.

DOUG
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd
hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal
side of squatting here and it's a piece
of cake.

CHRIS
Care to elaborate?

DOUG
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs
and we squat something that's not privately
owned, we should be in the clear; at least
DOUG (Cont_d)
until they get an eviction order and bring
in the bailiffs.

CHRIS
(to Katka)
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".

DOUG
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch.
Do you want to know what the icing is?

Doug takes a drink.

KATKA
No Doug, we don't and I have to be going.

Doug hits bottle on the table.
DOUG
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it
for you and your country.

KATKA
What? You are crazy!

DOUG
Look, just hear me out, okay?

CHRIS
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with
Katka on this one.

DOUG
Well, it's like I said, there's a
ton of empty buildings around here and
most of them were apparently given back
to the city, so they're not private....
Now, Jahn here is an drama student
at the University. He knows of a building
that they were going to turn into a puppet
theatre - they even began work on it, until
they ran out of money.

CHRIS
Puppet theatre, don't you need something
a little bigger?

DOUG
It's big, right Jahn?

JAHN
Yeah, for sure.

DOUG
And, since it's only two streets away,
I suggest we go take a look. Now!

KATKA
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by
eight. You promised to take me home.

DOUG
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes.
Without Jahn I might never find it...
We'll just have a quick look and then
you and I'll hit a tram.

The four of them get up and put on jackets and grab belongings.

KATKA
I don't want to get in trouble.

DOUG
Don't worry it's okay!

FOLLOW them to exit from squat bar.


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS/JAHN - NIGHT

Doug and Jahn walk ahead down narrow cobbled street.

ON DOUG/JAHN
JAHN
The place will need lots of work, I
think you might need some help.

DOUG
You mean you'd like to help?

JAHN
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I
am just warning you, that's all.

DOUG
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.

Jahn directs Doug to a passage way. Across the street is a building 
undergoing reconstruction and there is a rubbish skip outside.

JAHN
You can get in through windows at the
back, through here. The main entrance
is round the corner on Betlemska street,
but it's locked.

Doug and Jahn come to a halt and Katka and Chris catch up.

DOUG
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep
it quiet.

CHRIS
(to Katka)
We could make a run for it?

KATKA
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait
for you here.

DOUG
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!


EXT - COURTYARD - DOUG/CHRIS/JAHN - NIGHT

There are old apartment buildings on two/three sides and a large 
single level structure with intermittent broken glazing and a side 
entrance.

JAHN
That's it!

Jahn and Doug climb some steps up to the entrance door, Chris remains 
at the foot of the steps. Doug tries to open the door. To one side is 
a pane-less window frame - Doug looks in.

DOUG
Interesting. Do reckon I could
fit through here?

JAHN
Sure, I've done it easily.

DOUG
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.

Doug inches through window. Once in, he lights up his Zippo lighter.

DOUG (OS)
There's a lot of bloody rubble lying
around.......Jesus, it's dark!

Doug puts his head out the window.

DOUG
Have you got your Mag-Lite, Chris?

ANGLE Chris getting torch out of his pocket and tossing it carefully 
up to Jahn who passes it onto Doug.


INT - DECREPID BUILDING - DOUG - NIGHT

Doug stands on an unprotected balcony level which is stepped, small-
scale rubble everywhere and some rubbish. There is an abyss beyond 
the balcony and rough brick rear wall of auditorium. Doug moves to 
edge of balcony and looks down to the earth floor below. Doug comes 
back up balcony and follows a side-passage down. He squeezes past 
some steelwork and over more rubble. A car passes slowly outside and 
Doug switches off torch momentarily. He then proceeds along a 
corridor with peeled paint, loose light fittings and exposed wiring. 
He tries a light switch, it doesn't work. Doug enters into foyer area 
and looks down towards the lower level with it's dirt floor. The 
steps leading down have been partly excavated to reveal a large sewer 
pipe. Doug climbs over pipe and walks into auditorium.

DOUG
Wow.........I don't believe it.

Doug explores the auditorium space more, there is building debris, 
pieces of wood, sheet steel and some metal conduit. Doug goes back up 
into foyer and follows another corridor which leads up to the balcony 
area, but comes out on the other side. He walks across balcony back 
to the window and checks the door lock nearby, before putting his head 
out through the window.

DOUG
You were right Jahn, it's a great
space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want
to come and look?

CHRIS
No thanks, I think we ought to
get going though.


EXT - COURTYARD - DOUG/CHRIS/JAHN - NIGHT

Doug climbs out through window and rejoins Jahn and Chris.

DOUG
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as
partner in this project - together we
could make it swing, all it needs is a
good clean out and the power on, then
we're in business.

CHRIS
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and
shoot crap with you anytime, but this
is different.

DOUG
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do
something meaningful for a change, to
leave our mark on this town. Hell,
you'll probably be gone in another six
months and all you'll have done is
taught some kids the lines to a
Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out
on me now!

CHRIS
Alright I give in. But let's not end
up in jail. Okay?

DOUG
You got my word on it.


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - DOUG/KATKA/CHRIS - NIGHT

Jahn then Doug and Chris rejoin Katka who is pacing around.

KATKA
Doug you said you wouldn't be long.
Come on, I've got to go. Now!

DOUG
Alright, I'm coming. It's the
perfect place Jahn, thanks.

DOUG
Chris are you teaching tomorrow?

CHRIS
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.

DOUG
Great. Let's say nine o'clock
here tomorrow. Catch you later
partner.

Doug runs to catch up with Katka. Chris and Jahn walking off together 
in the opposite direction. Doug swings Katka around by the waist.

KATKA
It's not fair, you hardly talked
to me tonight.

DOUG
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy
evening. I'm going to make that place
into something big. God, I love you!

Doug kisses Katka and they embrace. Doug pushes Katka back up against 
a wall in the shadows and it continues passionately.

KATKA
Oh Doug, stop it, I have to get home.


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Shortly they come to the main road on the Old Town riverbank side not 
far from Charles Bridge and they pause.

DOUG
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't
done that for a while.

KATKA
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.

DOUG
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the
other side, it won't take any longer.
Come on!

Doug pulls Katka in the direction of the bridge.


EXT - CHARLES BRIDGE - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Doug and Katka walk across Charles Bridge. Show the illuminated 
beauty of the area including castle. Some musical BUSKERS are 
knocking out a Simon & Garfunkel tune. LOVERS and TOURISTS pass in 
each direction. Doug stops Katka half-way along and he pulls her to 
one side.

DOUG
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever
want to leave.

KATKA
So, we won't be going to London?

DOUG
No, not just yet.


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Doug and Katka run for a tram


INT - TRAM - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

There are a dozen or so other PASSENGERS. Doug takes a seat and Katka 
sits on his lap. Tram announces next stop. A MAN gets on with a 
muzzled DOG.


EXT - TRAM - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Doug and Katka get off tram, there are only TWO PASSENGERS left on 
tram. Doug and Katka walk over to a modern low-rise apartment 
building.

DOUG
I hope you're going to invite me in?

KATKA
Everybody is at home, it's no good.

DOUG
Let's have a look anyway.


INT - APARTMENT BUILDING - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Katka leads Doug up the stairs and she puts key in a doorlock. Doug 
is fondling her from behind as the door is opened and they enter.


INT - APARTMENT - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Doug enters reception area as Katka closes the front door. ANGLE 
Katka's MUM in the kitchen pouring some wine, she looks round to greet 
them as Doug and Katka take off their shoes. A wiener DOG runs to 
Katka.

(Mum: Attractive 40yr-old divorcee)

MUM
Ciao Baby, Hello Douglas!

KATKA
Ahoj

DOUG
Hi Mrs M.

Katka's Mum comes out of the kitchen with two glasses, one wine, one 
whisky and heads to the lounge with the dog following her, the T.V. is 
on and she closes the glazed door behind her. There is a bathroom, a 
toilet and two bedrooms leading off the reception area. Katka goes 
over to one of the bedroom doors and knocks gently, before going in.

KATKA
Ciao

ANGLE Katka's sister HELENA reclined on one of two beds.

(Helena: Fifteen yr-old Czech girl)

HELENA
I'm not moving.

ON KATKA/DOUG
KATKA
See!


DOUG
Max looked like he needed a walk, why
don't you take him?

ANGLE Helena.
HELENA
He doesn't, he's been!

DOUG
A hundred crowns says he'd like to
go again.

ANGLE Helena
HELENA
I am not going!

Doug turns away to Katka who closes the door

KATKA
She's tired.

DOUG
It's bad news when you can't even
bribe kids.

Doug embraces Katka.

DOUG
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep
soon, maybe we could do it quietly
under the sheets.

KATKA
No way Doug, I can't.

DOUG
Yeah, you're right....
I've got an idea!

Doug leads Katka to the bathroom.

KATKA
Dougy?


INT - BATHROOM - DOUG/KATKA - NIGHT

Door is blocked shut with a clothes horse, on which there are some 
clothes and there is Doug and Katka's discarded clothes on the floor. 
Show open shower cubicle where Doug and Katka are vigorously making 
love under running shower. Erotic action with Katka supported by Doug 
and her legs wrapped around his back. Usual cries and murmurs as 
steam builds up.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT - BETLEMSKA STREET - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Building site down the street from the squat space is active and 
rubbish is being burnt in a large oil drum out front. Site has wood 
and mesh fencing. Doug comes out of passage way to meet Chris who has 
been waiting.

ON DOUG
DOUG
Have you been waiting long?

ANGLE Chris coming over to Doug.

ON DOUG/CHRIS
CHRIS
Ten minutes.

DOUG
Sorry, I couldn't resist going exploring.

Doug ushers Chris through the passage into courtyard.

------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The performance space will hereafter be known as the ASYLUM.
------------------------------------------------------------------


EXT - ASYLUM COURTYARD - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Show rear of Asylum and building degradation together with overlooking 
apartments, obviously occupied. Doug and Chris climb rear entrance 
stairs and climb in through the window, Doug first and Chris 
struggles.


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Reveal extent of loose debris and the size of the space. There is a 
large skylight in the auditorium, but it's very dirty. Minimal 
daylight.

ON CHRIS
CHRIS
Some puppet theatre. Jesus, look at
all this crap.

Chris kicks a piece of debris off over the balcony. He moves towards 
the edge of the formed concrete balcony to look down. Sounds echo. 
ANGLE DOUG
DOUG
Watch out.

ON CHRIS
CHRIS
I don't know man, this place is
just a hole in the ground.


ON DOUG/CHRIS
DOUG
No, there's something special about this
place. It's as though it's living,
disintegrating - You could almost chart
the history of the country by this wall alone.

Doug runs his hand along brickwork, the face of which crumbles.

CHRIS
Suppose the roof's like that too.

ANGLE skylight and weatherproof roof.
DOUG
No, that's what's been holding it together
all these years, just like mother Russia.

ON DOUG/CHRIS
CHRIS
Sure. What are we going to do with this
place Doug? It's due for demolition,
that's why they gave up on it.

DOUG
Believe me, Chris. I've got a good
feeling about this place, come on.

Doug leads Chris down one of the side corridors


INT - ASYLUM FOYER - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug and Chris enter into foyer area, Chris tries a light switch.

DOUG
That's our first job.

Doug and Chris go down into towards auditorium, over the exposed sewer 
pipe which is glistening with liquid at one side.

CHRIS
That stinks!

DOUG
Yeah, that could be job number two.
I think it's a sewer.

Chris wipes his hands on his pants.

CHRIS
Cool, real cool!


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Chris joins Doug in the centre of the auditorium and they survey the 
area. The balcony runs on three sides. Reveal building materials 
lying on the earth and a few dangling light fittings.

ON CHRIS
CHRIS
Hey look, an old pay-phone. I wonder
if it's got any money in it?

Chris kicks it but it barely moves. ANGLE Doug coming over to Chris.

ON DOUG/CHRIS
DOUG
Never mind now - First, I'll find the
switchboard and see if I can get the power on.

CHRIS
You know something about those things?

DOUG
No, but like my dad said, "There's only
so many ways you can wire a plug".

CHRIS
He was an electrician?

DOUG
No, he was talking about girls, I think.

CHRIS
That makes you an expert I guess.

DOUG
Too right....Now the other thing we've
got to do is start clearing up the rubble.
Can you make a start on that?

Chris looks down at his clothes

CHRIS
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess
I might as well come out lookin' like one!

DOUG
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as
soon as I can.

Doug turns to exit.
CHRIS
Just two things. What do I use to shift
the stuff and where in hell am I gonna
put it all?

DOUG
Scout around and see if there's something,
check that other corridor. If there's
nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.

CHRIS
And put it on expenses?

DOUG
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.

Doug leads Chris back over to the pipe and surrounding large 
excavation.

DOUG
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid
that thing since we can't really replace
it and then put a walkway over it.

CHRIS
So?

DOUG
Well, we might as well start filling it in
now. As long as you leave enough room
around that end of the pipe - so I can get
to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards
to stop it all spilling into the space -
We'll neaten it up later.

CHRIS
You sure got a handle on that word "we".

Chris drags over the boards close to the pipe and lines them up. 
Follow Doug to one of the corridors as he traces some exposed wiring 
back up to the balcony area (It leads to a switchboard which is 
hanging off the wall). There is a large cable leading out of the box 
and through the side wall near the windows.


EXT - ASYLUM - DOUG - DAY

Doug pops his head out of the window and sees the cable running off to 
a meter box. He climbs out.


EXT - ASYLUM METER BOX - DOUG - DAY

DOUG
Well, here goes nothing.

Doug flicks on all the breakers that are off.


EXT - ASYLUM - DOUG - DAY

Doug walks back to windows and looks in.

DOUG
Well, what do you know!

Doug climbs back in.


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG - DAY

A balcony light is on and Doug goes down the corridor and tries a 
light switch which increases the illumination of the passage, although 
some globes do work.


INT - ASYLUM FOYER - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Chris is holding an old shovel and has cleared a section as Doug 
enters from a the corridor.

DOUG
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie
to my resume.....Good shovel!

CHRIS
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them,
the other's in there.

DOUG
Later Mate, right now I've got to do
the locks on these doors so we don't have
to climb through that bloody window every
time.

CHRIS
I thought that was part of the charm!

DOUG
I'll drill the locks and replace
the barrels, that way it won't cost
so much.

CHRIS
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother
with writing?

DOUG
I'm making history Chris, nothings going
to stop me. There could be a knighthood
for us in this, once President Havel hears.

CHRIS
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?

DOUG
No.....But I think Honza at the office
has. You keep shifting this crap and
I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't
take long. Take a break for lunch and
I'll catch you up later.

CHRIS
And if the police stop by - what do I
tell them?

DOUG
Tell them we're working for the University.

CHRIS
Thought of everything haven't you.

DOUG
Yep, except a name for this place.

CHRIS
You're nuts man, Katka's right!


EXT - PRAGUE STREET - DOUG - DAY

Doug walks along a cobbled street, over the road and into a fairly 
impressive old-style apartment building.


INT - OLD APARTMENT BUILDING - DOUG - DAY

Doug_s office is on an upper floor in a converted apartment. On the 
entry door is a notice, BUGLER - STUDENT VOICE OF DEMOCRACY. Doug 
enters.

INT - BUGLER OFFICE - DOUG - DAY

Decor is mostly original plus posters of Berlin Wall and American 
Republican Party Convention hung up. State of the art office and 
desktop publishing equipment. Doug walks up to the receptionist 
RENATA.

(Renata: Czech girl early twenties)

DOUG
Hi Rene, any messages?

ANGLE the room. There are two other men. Renata checks for messages.

(Honza: Czech man late twenties, tough-looking)

ON HONZA

HONZA
Hey Doug, where you been?

ON DOUG/RENATA

DOUG
Working....Under cover.

ON HONZA
HONZA
Yeah, what's her name?

ON DOUG/RENATA

RENATA
There's nothing for you Doug.
Are you going to be around today?

DOUG
No, I'm too busy. Is the boss in?

RENATA
Yes and I think he would like to see you.

DOUG
Later.

Doug joins a clean-cut young man JIRI sitting at a P.C. terminal.

(Jiri: Czech man early-twenties)

DOUG
Alright Jiri, getting the hang of it?

Jiri shrugs and continues. Doug grabs a chair and sits down next to 
Honza.

ON DOUG\HONZA
DOUG
I need to borrow something from
you Honza.

HONZA
Forget it, I'm broke.

DOUG
No, just a drill.

HONZA
A drill, what are you up to?

DOUG
Nothing. I've got to put up some
kitchen shelves that's all. You've
got one haven't you?

HONZA
Yeah.

DOUG
And a fifty foot extension lead?

HONZA
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!

DOUG
Come on, don't me give a hard time.
I'm just trying to make the place
look nice for Katka.


HONZA
Sure!

DOUG
Give me a break, will you. How often
do I ask you for something?

HONZA
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back.
It belongs to my father.

DOUG
No problem, is it at your place?

HONZA
Yeah.


DOUG
Great, let's break for lunch and
I'll buy you a beer on the way.

HONZA
But I have to finish this....

DOUG
Come on, that shit can wait.

Doug helps Honza out of his seat and turns to head to the door but is 
confronted by the boss, HENRY.

(Henry: 40 yr-old American, stressed out) 

ANGLE HENRY
HENRY
Well, Well, Douglas it's good to see you.
Have you stopped by to pick up your things?

ON DOUG/HONZA
DOUG
No, I came to have a word with you. I've
got something I think you'll like.

ANGLE HENRY
HENRY
Really, what's that? A terminal illness!

Doug moves to join Henry.

DOUG
No, it's a story on the cutting edge
of Prague's sub-culture. If you've
got a moment, I'll fill you in.

Doug and Henry move to his office. Doug turns to Honza.

DOUG
Hang five Honza, I'll be right with you.


INT - HENRY'S OFFICE - DOUG/HENRY - DAY

The office is a cluttered and there is an American flag in the corner 
and a picture of George Bush on the wall along with a large map of 
Eastern Europe with dots marking capital cities. Doug and Henry take 
their seats.

ON HENRY
HENRY
So? What've you got for me?

ON DOUG/HENRY
DOUG
The inside scoop on the squat scene!

HENRY
What squat scene?

Doug picks up a pack of Henry_s cigarettes from the desk.

DOUG
You mean you don't know, Henry!
We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling
a six-level block of luxury apartments
down on Janovska street here in the Old
Town, and you don't know about it?

HENRY
Ah, so what?

DOUG
That's only the half of it. I've heard
a rumour they're taking over a theatre
to use for alternative arts; you know
what that means?

Henry shakes his head slowly.

DOUG
Henry, these guys already push most of the
drugs in this town and now they want to move
into pornography, right? Believe me, it
won't stop there either, next it'll be a
church and pretty soon they'll have their
own department store or something......
Henry, we've got to stop them. The
foundation's got to put an end to it!

HENRY
How?

DOUG
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't
easy, but slowly they're opening up to me.
Give me a month and I'll blow their
movement wide open.

HENRY
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're
not crapping me?

DOUG
You can hold back this months pay-check
until I come through with the story.

HENRY
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!

DOUG
Henry, I've been working my tail off
on this. Look, all I need is a little
cash to loosen up some tongues and you've
got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags
down for life; be a big feather in the cap
for the Bugler and your board of directors
back home!

HENRY
I got a bad feeling about this....
How much do you need?

DOUG
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand
crowns?

Henry chokes slightly and gets some cash out of his pocket and counts 
out some notes on the desk.

HENRY
There's three thousand and if you don't
come through, I'm going throw you clean
out of that window. Deal?

DOUG
Deal!

Doug gets up to go.

HENRY
And take Jiri with you?

DOUG
What for?

HENRY
Insurance!

Doug exits into main office.


INT - BUGLER OFFICE - DOUG/RENATA/HONZA/JIRI - DAY

DOUG goes to the reception and scribbles out a note before walking 
over to Jiri.

DOUG
Hey Jiri, it's your lucky day you're
working with me. Here's what I want you
to do - Go to this address, you'll find a
cafe; a squat. I want you to keep an eye
on it and put everything down in a daily
report to Rene. This is big, so don't let
me down, okay? Just dress up smart and
take lots of notes..

DOUG
Come on Honza let's split, drinks on me.

ANGLE Honza getting up and walking to Doug. Doug winks at Renata.

HONZA
So, he didn't fire you?

DOUG
No way, he even gave me back pay.

Doug and Honza exit office.


EXT - BETLEMSKA STREET - DOUG - DAY

Workmen are finishing up on building site, rubbish is smouldering in 
the drum. An OLD LADY passes by with a wiener DOG. Doug's walking 
down the street with knapsack on. He passes Asylum front entrance and 
stops to look at front side and peers through door crack before moving 
on. Doug checks out a passing YOUNG LADY and goes around the corner 
and enters into the passage, going through to rear court yard.


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug is inside and walks down a corridor, there is still lots of 
rubble around and shovelling noises are heard. Doug stumbles over 
some rubble, he's slightly drunk.

DOUG
Chris!


INT - ASYLUM FOYER - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug walks across foyer, shovelling has stopped and the area has been 
cleared of rubble.

DOUG
Chris?

ANGLE Chris covered in dust/dirt emerging from the other dimly-lit 
side corridor. 

DOUG
Wow!....What have you been doing,
rolling around in it?

CHRIS
No, just making my contribution to
cultural enlightenment, that's all.

DOUG
Well, don't get carried away.

CHRIS
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to
you. Anyway, there's still plenty
more of it.

DOUG
Good, I love swinging a shovel.

Doug takes off knapsack, kneels down and opens it up.

DOUG
Wasn't easy, but I've got what we need.

Show drill and lead, plus drill bits, a small wood saw, screwdriver, 
pliers, some lock barrels and a hammer. Chris bends down, picks up 
drill and stands up.

CHRIS
Where did you find it all, in a pub?


DOUG
No, why?

CHRIS
'cause you stink of booze.

DOUG
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had
to buy him a few beers in return
for the gear.

CHRIS
Tough break.

Doug surveys the foyer, pipe area and checks the other corridor.

DOUG
Looking good, another day and we
should have this place cleared up.

Chris shakes his head. Doug moves to Chris and slaps him on his back 
and a dust cloud comes off.

DOUG
You belong in museum....
Guess what?

Chris dusts himself off a little.

CHRIS
I'm an idiot?

DOUG
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a
name for this place and you were the
inspiration though.

CHRIS
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?

DOUG
No....The Asylum!

CHRIS
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?

DOUG
None, it's mine - you said it earlier,
I'm nuts.

CHRIS
I've been saying that since we met.

DOUG
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is
going to be a crazy place and, since
the Commies are used to seeking asylum,
we can use that in the marketing.

ANGLE Chris going into the corridor.

CHRIS(OS)
Asylum....Marketing....Jesus!

Chris emerges with two shovels and hands one to Doug.

CHRIS
Here, try it for size.

Doug takes shovel and takes a practice swing.

DOUG
Perfect, but I can't use it right now,
I've got to get these locks done; it's
a matter of priorities.

CHRIS
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.

DOUG
Just save me a little patch and
I'll do it later.

Doug picks up the drill and necessary tools.

CHRIS
Oh don't worry.

Chris goes off into corridor and Doug moves to the lock on the large 
two-panel front entrance and surveys it. Doug bends down for closer 
look before exiting with extension lead to find a socket.


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG - DAY

Doug fits a drill bit, triggers drill then lines it up with lock and 
starts to drill.


INT - ASYLUM - CHRIS - DAY

Chris shovels rubble/rubbish onto a large piece of sheet metal with a 
rope attached. Drill is heard. Nearby is a decrepid workbench which 
Chris clears. Chris picks up some tins and potentially useful objects 
and puts then on the table, drilling stops. Chris then finishes 
shovelling a load onto the sled and then drags it away towards the 
foyer.


INT ASYLUM FOYER CHRIS - DAY

Chris enters the foyer pulling the load, the main entrance doors are 
now partly open. Chris drags the load over to the top of the steps 
leading down to the pipe area and stops. Looking around he sees no 
sign of Doug and so he exits onto Betlemska Street.


EXT - BETLEMSKA STREET - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Show apartment above and to the side of the Asylum, to the left is 
another section of the Asylum building. Doug studies it. A window 
has been bricked up and, further along, the probable entrance is 
barred.

ANGLE CHRIS

CHRIS
The door didn't take long!

Doug looks into the apartment block entrance to the left of the 
Asylum.

ANGLE CHRIS
CHRIS
Lost something?

Doug comes over to Chris but takes a walking measure of the additional 
Asylum frontage. 

ON DOUG/CHRIS
DOUG
That's strange, it's as if there's
another section in here and it's not
connected to the apartments.

CHRIS
You mean we've been short-changed?

DOUG
I don't know but that used to be a
window and I think that was a door.

CHRIS
Can you do the lock on it?

DOUG
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a
look from the inside.

Doug and Chris go back into the Asylum.


INT - ASYLUM - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug and Chris go into a corridor. Doug paces around.

DOUG
It must be on the other side of this.

CHRIS
But how did the wall get here?

DOUG
I don't know. This wall isn't like the
rest though, it's not all that old either.

Doug looks up at ceiling arches. ANGLE a rough wall joint.

DOUG
This wall looks like it's been put up
to block it off. It's not part of
the building support.

ANGLE a water tap dripping on an adjoining wall.

DOUG
I'd love to get in there.

CHRIS
Don't we have enough already?

DOUG
It must be fair old size, suppose it's
empty?

CHRIS
And suppose a little old lady lives there?

DOUG
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there
she's dead.

CHRIS
Sounds like a good reason to leave it
alone.

DOUG
Just think though, it would make a hell
of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium
clear.

Doug exits and Chris follows.


EXT - BETLEMSKA STREET - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug looks over the facade again, it's late afternoon.

DOUG
Well, it's definitely there - We've
just got to get to it.

CHRIS
Why, how in the hell are we going to
set up a cafe?

DOUG
I'll rig up something don't worry -
Do you think I could bash through
with that little hammer?

CHRIS
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got
the place together and already you want
to extend it.

DOUG
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll
brick it back up.

Chris checks his watch, Doug heads back to the entrance.

CHRIS
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you
have met Katka?

DOUG
Is it gone four-thirty?

Chris
Try five-thirty!

DOUG
Uh-Oh.

Doug darts in to the Asylum and comes out with knapsack, leather 
jacket and takes off, but turns back suddenly.

ON DOUG
DOUG
Here's one of the keys, lock up!

Doug throws the key and runs off, Chris stands out front of the 
Asylum.


EXT - PRAGUE DOWNTOWN - DOUG/KATKA - DAY

Doug is running along a crowded shopping street, pushing his way past 
slow-moving Czechs, plenty of window shoppers and kids. He bumps into 
a LADY with shopping and tries to apologise. A Prague Echo Newstand 
has headline "Corrupt Minister found hanged_. Doug runs across the 
street, just missing a car, and along to a bar.


INT - CAFE/BAR - DOUG/KATKA - DAY

Doug enters, Katka sees Doug and checks her watch and gives him an icy 
stare before looking away towards the bar. Doug passes bar and 
BARMAN, a Czech man in his forties, there is only one other customer 
in the small bar which is a glitzy place with many mirrors. Doug 
approaches Katka hesitantly. Katka is sitting on the edge of a bench, 
in a small booth. Doug sits down opposite Katka, there is an empty 
tall cocktail glass by Katka - uncomfortable silence, Katka is still 
looking away.

DOUG
I'm sorry!.......I lost track of
time, I've been working on that
building all day.

The Barman comes over to take drinks order.

DOUG
Beer please! Do you want another drink?

KATKA
Fernet and tonic.

Momentary silence.

DOUG
So, how was your day?

Silence, Katka looks Doug in the face.

KATKA
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is
use me and expect me to wait for you.

DOUG
No.

KATKA
I thought you loved me Doug but all you
want from me is sex.

Barman approaches and lays down the drinks

DOUG
That's not true, we have a great time
together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's
forget about it and go stop by my place,
so I can get changed.

KATKA
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.

ANGLE the Barman leaning on the end of the bar talking to a CUSTOMER.

KATKA
I could have my choice of many boyfriends
and go to movies and discos but I waste
my time waiting for you and then going to
stupid pubs.

DOUG
I'm not a bloody teenager okay,
I told you I can't do that shit.

KATKA
That's it, I am just stupid teenager,
yes?

DOUG
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.

Katka starts to cry.

KATKA
I wanted someone who loves me, all my
friends talk of getting married and what
will happen to me? You just use me!

ANGLE Barman looking over at Doug. Doug notices Barman taking an 
interest. Doug reaches out to touch Katka's arm but she moves it.

DOUG
No, I love you, really.

KATKA
Then tell me, what will happen?
Tell me!

DOUG
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve
years older, I could never marry you,
it'd be stupid, you know that!


KATKA
See! You think I'm stupid, You just
use me and you will never love me....
I hate you!

Katka throws her drink in Doug's face and storms off, knocking Doug's 
beer into his lap accidentally with her handbag. ANGLE Barman heading 
over. Doug puts back his glass on the table and gets up to shake off 
the drink and gets out a handkerchief to wipe his face. The Barman 
looks in disgust at Doug and wipes down table. Doug looks at the 
Barman apologetically. When the table is straight Doug sits back down 
and finishing the drop of beer left in his glass, looks up at the 
Barman who is standing over Doug.

DOUG
Bill please.

Barman scribbles on a chit and drops it on the table.

DOUG
I've been around.

LAWRENCE
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.

DOUG
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the
lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing
a party tomorrow night to show it off.
It's going to be for alternative arts,
but I need some help to finish it off,
can you put the word out?

LAWRENCE
Sure. Excellent.

DOUG
Here's the details.

Doug hands Lawrence a piece of paper

DOUG
I'll put one on the notice-board too.

HOLLY
Am I invited?

DOUG
Sure as long as you don't bring
that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.

Doug moves off.

ON HOLLY/LAWRENCE

HOLLY
Nice guy, what's he got against Josh?

He just despises success and society
generally, it's not personal.

He turns, checks out the cafe occupants and exits.

HOLLY

just waiting for the workers to go home.

CHRIS
Destroy the evidence huh.

DOUG
Have you ever stolen anything?

CHRIS
Nope.

DOUG
Could you handle it if it was

CHRIS
Like helping a sick kid?

DOUG
No, for the Asylum.

DOUG
Perfect!

CHRIS
It looks new, they might miss one

DOUG
We're going to need it all.

DOUG

CHRIS
Why don't we just take the whole
damn building, brick by brick Doug.

DOUG
Look at it this way, it's their
contribution. If we'd explained
it to them, they'd probably have
given it to us anyway.

CHRIS
So why didn't we?

DOUG
We don't speak Czech!


DOUG and Chris exits.

Okay, but remind me Saturday, yeah.

DOUG
Ugh, okay...Thanks.

Lubosh smiles and turns to sleep. Doug gets up but comes back to

metal saw, two-dozen masonry bolts and an adjustable wrench.

CHRIS
You want those fittings as well?

Doug turns.
DOUG
Yeah and can you bring the drill up too.

Chris exits while Doug marks up a length of scaffold, props it up then 
gets the saw and starts cutting it. Chris returns with scaffold 
stands and joint pieces and drops them down before going off again. A 
piece of cut off scaffold falls and rolls down and off balcony. Doug 
gets another length and saws it like the other. Chris brings up the 
drill, dragging a connected extension lead behind him. Chris watches 
Doug in action.

CHRIS
You should qualify for some kind of
award.....I've got it, the Nobel prize
for Unauthorized Reconstruction.

Doug takes no notice, finishes off the scaffold.

DOUG
Okay Bonzo, we've got to join these
pieces together then stick those stands
on the ends and fix'em to the pillars.


CHRIS
A safety rail, Ingenious!

Doug cocks a grin.

DOUG
You measure up the other sides and cut
the rest of the scaffold.

Chris salutes and Doug picks up a joint piece and the wrench. Chris 
waits a moment.

CHRIS
Tape?

Doug looks up, realizes it's clipped to his belt and un-clips it and 
throws it to Chris. Chris goes over to measure distances between 
other pillars while Doug slots the joint piece between two lengths and 
tightens the expansion bolt. Chris gets to work on the other lengths 
of scaffold. Doug holds up a scaffold stand to a pillar.

DOUG
Hey....That look high enough to you?

Chris turns from his work.

CHRIS
Yes Boss!

base-plate and puts it down. Doug grabs the drill changes the bit 
then drills the two holes and proceeds to fix the plate to the pillar 
with masonry bolts. Doug then drills the opposite pillar but does not 
fit plate. Chris takes a break and gets a pack of cigarettes out.

No. Here give me a hand with this
scaffold.

of scaffold. Doug slots it onto the fixed base-plate.

DOUG
Just hold it up there.

Doug picks up a base-plate and walks over to Chris's end, moves 
scaffold clear of pillar, slots on the plate and slides it into 
position and screw up the masonry bolts. When first rail is done Doug 
stands back in admiration and Chris gets out a cigarette.

DOUG
Here, give me one of those smokes.

Chris shakes his head and gets packet out again and offers it to Doug 
who gets out Zippo lighter and lights them both up.

CHRIS
Do you think anyone will really
come here?

DOUG
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the
Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of
joint will make _em reminisce about
the sixties. Plus we should get
a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.

Doug starts working with tools.

Fancy some lunch after we_re through

we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want
to help. We should have that floor done
in a day or so.

Doug gets out some money and they stop walking.

DOUG
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns.
That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.

CHRIS
No beer?

DOUG
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look
right.

Doug hands some money to Chris.

DOUG
You get the wine and I'll go see if I
can rustle up some plastic cups.

CHRIS
Why don't we go together?

DOUG
No, it could take me hours. You know
what it's like trying to find things
in this town, not to mention disposable
stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever
heard of them.

Interesting space you got here.

No expense spared.

some performance poetry here....A weekly
thing.

LAWRENCE
Hmm, I see possibilities but you
got a lot to do.

DOUG
We should be done by the weekend.

LAWRENCE
Really?

DOUG
I could pencil you in if you like?

LAWRENCE
I'll take a rain-check for now.

Doug moves past Lawrence and Chris out from bar. He is holding an 
empty beer bottle and opener. Doug takes the chair Holly is sitting 
on and stands up on it. He bangs bottle and opener together and calls 
attention.

DOUG
Can I have your attention, please.

Crowd quiets down.

DOUG
Thank you, thank you...........Okay,
I'd like to welcome you to the Asylum's
pre-opening party. I hope you're all
DOUG (Cont_d)
having a good time.....The Asylum_s a
free-space for performing art and we
hope to share the more radical elements
of our culture with the Czech_s and vice-versa.
Anyway, we want this place to be your
place and together I believe we can
really make a difference...You may however
have noticed that there is still little
work to do, like the flooring downstairs.

Someone in the crowd yells
HECKLER
What about a john?

Crowd laughs.
DOUG
Yeah, that too eventually. For those of
you that don't know, the nearest toilet
is in the pub around the corner. Anyhow,
part of the reason for inviting you
this evening was to ask you to help out
over the next few days to get the floor
done and maybe some painting too. You
don't have to be an expert, we've proved
that.....So, if I could have a show of
hands?

No hands go up, Holly is wavering.

DOUG
I said, hands up all those willing to
help out a little here.

Still no hands. Doug turns to Chris in disbelief.

DOUG
Let me see if I understand this. You lot,
think you represent Western culture here
and when you're given an opportunity of a
life-time to prove it, you turn it down.
Don't you want to get your hands dirty or
something, is that it?

Some people begin to leave.

DOUG
I see, you've got your hands too far up
your collective arse to pull it out long
enough except to drink my bloody wine.

CHRIS
Forget it Doug, it's no good.

Doug smashes his bottle against the far wall, showering a few people 
in glass. This starts a stampede for the exit.

DOUG
Go on, get out, everybody out, out.
Out!.....Out!

Holly has moved with the crowd, Lawrence is still by the bar, Doug 
picks up a wooden chair and smashes it on a table, tossing a piece 
after the last people exiting.

ANGLE CHRIS/LAWRENCE

CHRIS
All in all, I think it went pretty well.

LAWRENCE
Beats my performance shit.

of wine and takes it over to Doug.

CHRIS
Carpentry can't be that tough,
we'll do it.

Doug takes a swig of wine.

stage hands?

JAHN
Sure, they are students.

DOUG
There's three thousand crowns, it's all

Look, if you can get them to finish

No, We aren't going to do it.

What?

HOLLY
Seems a shame!

DOUG
The way I look at it, I've carried the

Hear me out I beg of you. They build

I beseech you, look not West for guidance
but to me, I am your hope, your future.
Follow me and you will need no other.
Where there is darkness, I shall put
streetlights, where there is misery, I
shall visit and where there is desperation,

eyebrow occasionally, when checking thickness of the wooden boards.

JAHN
They'll do it.

DOUG
Great. And your all set for the
performance?

JAHN
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get
the floor done in time, me and the
others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon,
but it's not critical.

DOUG
Don't go making it too simple,
we're on the cutting edge here.

Jahn laughs.

JAHN
For us it's simple, for you it's
incredible.

Doug smiles and slaps Jahn on the back. The students get straight to 
work, they are professional stage/set guys. Doug grabs a beer and 
offers it to Jahn.

JAHN
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you
could get some beers for the guys.

DOUG
Don't worry. Thanks.

depend on the secrecy of those
records, including your own now.

That was not my decision, I can only
guess that one day we will again be
active and our honour restored. In the
meantime no one else must know those
files exist. Secure the building and
I will arrange alternative safe
storage immediately.

And what of these foreigners?

them all if you have to, but keep those
records secret.

DOUG
Yes.

DIPLOMAT
Date of birth, November the fourth
nineteen-sixty-two.

DOUG
Yes.

DIPLOMAT
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue,
Coventry.

DOUG
That's my mum's.

DIPLOMAT
I see, would you like us to inform her
of your situation?

DOUG
No!

DIPLOMAT
Now, have you been read your rights
and are you aware of the charges?

DOUG
No!

DIPLOMAT
Well, I'll try and get that clarified.
As I understand it though, the charges
include break and enter, theft, trespass,
operating an unlicensed facility,
vandalism and destruction of government
documents - Whatever possessed you to
start destroying people's medical records?

DOUG
They didn't look like medical files to me.

DIPLOMAT
Well a plea of ignorance won't go
far here. Frankly, I think you deserve
everything that's coming.

DOUG
Regards to Her Majesty.

Doug gets up, walks to door and knocks on it. Diplomat is still 
filling in some details when an Officer comes in.

DIPLOMAT
Before you go, did you get those
bruises here?

DOUG
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever
voted Conservative.

Doug and officer exit. Show Diplomat shaking head and sliding papers 
to the bottom of an already full briefcase.


INT - COURTROOM - DOUG - DAY

Doug is led into the room hand-cuffed and he is shown to a table where 
there are TWO MEN sitting. Doug looks tired. Courtroom is small, 
modern and functional with barred window and Communist icons still in 
place together with a Czech Republic flag and coat of arms displayed. 
There is a JUDGE drinking coffee flanked by TWO ADVISORS and nearby 
are CLERKS and a STENOGRAPHER. Adjacent to Doug's table is another 
table with a civilian, who is the PROSECUTOR, and TWO POLICE OFFICERS. 
The man next to Doug introduces himself.

(Jaroslav: weaselly Czech man in his thirties)

JAROSLAV
(to Doug)
My name is Jaroslav Novak, I will be your
translator.

Jaroslav gestures to a man at the table who is going through some 
papers.
JAROSLAV
This is Petr Vitovetch, he will represent
you.

(Petr: Unpleasant-looking Czech professional in his fifties)

DOUG
About time I saw a lawyer.
(to Petr)
We've got some serious talking to do.

Petr doesn't respond and Doug looks back at Jaroslav. The JUDGE calls 
Petr to the bar and they talk casually. The stenographer takes notes. 
Occasionally they look at Doug and are joined at the bar by the 
prosecutor. They continue discussion and refer to the advisors who 
check through some books.


DOUG
(to Jaroslav)
Any chance of getting me out on bail?

JAROSLAV
What is bail?

Doug shakes his head.

DOUG
Will they free me?

JAROSLAV
I don't know - maybe they are talking
about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good
friend of the Judge.

DOUG
Will this thing take long?

JAROSLAV
No, it should be over soon.

DOUG
You mean it's started?

JAROSLAV
Of course, you can see that lady over
there, she is recording everything.

DOUG
How do I know what's being said?

JAROSLAV
I will tell you - within a week I will
have the transcript and we can go through
it.

Doug shakes his head in disbelief. Petr comes back to the table and 
talks with Jaroslav.

PETR
(Subtitles)
He is in big trouble, the Judge will
hang him out to dry, but tell him he has
nothing to worry about. The trial will
be in two weeks and he must stay in police
custody till then. Here are the charges.

Petr hands Jaroslav some papers, show Judge exiting. Petr joins up 
with the prosecutor and they leave together. Jaroslav is still 
talking to Doug who is now staring away, his guards wait nearby.

to keep you waiting.

HOLLY
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.

JOSH
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?

end of the couch clasping her hands, knees together. Josh enters the 
office and closes door, he goes to his desk, a distance from Holly.

JOSH
So, what have you got to say for
yourself? Was he good in bed?

HOLLY
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been
arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought
maybe your father and the Embassy might
be able to do something.

JOSH
You really are a piece of work, you know
that? You walk out on me and my family
for some worthless bum and you expect us
to help him when he screws up.

Josh laughs and shakes his head, Holly gets up to leave.

JOSH
Suppose I do help him?

Holly turns back to Josh.
JOSH
Will you come home and forget all about
him?

HOLLY
Yes, if you can get him free.

JOSH
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll
be just as they were, okay?

Josh comes over to Holly and moves a hand down from her head to a 
breast.

JOSH
Deal?

Holly nods with tears in her eyes and Josh pulls open her blouse and 
then moves back her head to kiss her.


INT - POLICE CELLBLOCK - DOUG/CHRIS - DAY

Doug is sharing a cell with an elderly MAN. Cell-mate is playing 
chequers on his bed, Doug is using a spoon to make carvings on the 
wall. There are metal plates on a small table. Daylight comes in 
through a small barred window. Chris enters the cellblock with a 
GUARD opening/closing barred door behind him and comes down the 
corridor. SHOW some assorted other detainees. Chris walks straight up 
to Doug's cell but slows a little as he approaches. Chris is carrying 
a copy of the "Prague Echo".

CHRIS
I thought I'd find you here.

Doug turns slowly.
DOUG
Chris! Tell me some good news.

DOUG
Tell me some bad news?

CHRIS
I don't want to ruin your day.

DOUG
That bad?

CHRIS
Your too good for this town, Buddy.

DOUG
So I hear.

CHRIS
Huh?

DOUG
I had a visit from the British Embassy.
They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.

CHRIS
They ain't the only ones.

Chris passes newspaper through bars.

CHRIS
I stopped by your office. Henry was
steaming, he says he's going to throw
you out of the window and that you
never worked at the Bugler.

DOUG
He got that one right.

CHRIS
Honza says they'll print an open letter
to President Havel in next weeks edition
even if they have to threaten a walk-out.

Doug goes back to his bed.
DOUG
They're good guys.....
Have you seen Holly?

CHRIS
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and
his friends are in big trouble with the
University, they might even be expelled.

DOUG
Damn!

CHRIS
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?

DOUG
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy
family over there.

CHRIS
What happened?

DOUG
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

CHRIS
You're kidding.

DOUG
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I
think they've already sentenced me. They
just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.

CHRIS
WE gotta think of something.

DOUG
Now you're using that word.

CHRIS
I could try and get a Western lawyer.

Momentary silence.
DOUG
You know, there is one thing I can't
figure out. All along they've been
bugging me about those files and when
I told them I'd burned all that stuff,
they went nuts - they told the Consul
guy they were medical records?

CHRIS
So?

DOUG
Well, it seems they've dropped any
charge relating to the files.

CHRIS
Lucky break!

DOUG
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what
those files were all about. Suppose it
was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on
big people or maybe the personnel records
of the secret police, that might explain
all the hassle and the cover-up.

CHRIS
Did you see anything in the files?

DOUG
It was all in Czech wasn't it.

DOUG
What happened to those disks I gave
you, have you still got them?

CHRIS
Yeah, somewhere?

DOUG
Suppose those contained all the file
info too? You could have a third or so
of it there.

CHRIS
Do you want me to see what's on them?

DOUG
No point, it'll be in Czech and God
knows what format. But if I'm right,
they could be my ticket out of here.

CHRIS
And if you're wrong.

DOUG
Siberia.

CHRIS
What do you want me to do?

DOUG
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech
girl to smuggle it in to me this evening.
Put the others in a locker and write the
details in a note to Reuters and be ready
to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd
better keep clear of your apartment too.
Do you know someone with a phone?

CHRIS
Yeah, Dave Walters.

DOUG
Good, what's his number?

Chris gets out little address book and flicks through it.

CHRIS
It's...42 56 76 .

DOUG
42 56 76.........
Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call
tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by
three o'clock, send that note and get
out of the country fast.

CHRIS
Doug, I can't just leave you!

DOUG
You're in the clear, keep it that way,
I'll be okay.

Chris looks at cell and Doug's cell-mate.

DOUG
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this
country and I want Holly to come with me.
So, if she doesn't come here today, you're
going to have to get her to me tomorrow;
after I call, promise?

CHRIS
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?

DOUG
You could give me your baseball, so I
can drive this bastard nuts.....He's
been playing chequers for eight hours
and still hasn't won a game.

ANGLE Cell-mate struggling with next chequers move. Chris reaches 
into his jacket pocket and gets out the baseball and hands it through 
bars.

DOUG
Thanks, now get lost. Go on!

Chris turns and goes off along corridor, the baseball is heard 
bouncing off the cell wall over and over again.

along with the chequers board and pieces.

DOUG
Kat, what are you doing here?

Doug gets off bed and comes over to the bars.

KATKA
Chris came to see me, I did not know
this had happened to you. He asked me
to give you something.

Katka looks around to see if anyone is watching, then reaches under 
her skirt and pulls out a floppy disk.

KATKA
I thought for sure they would catch me.

DOUG
Thanks.

Doug puts disk in his trouser pocket.

KATKA
Will it help to get you out?

DOUG
I hope so!

Momentary silence.
KATKA
If you get out can we be together again.

DOUG
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I
won't be able to stay in Prague.

KATKA
But we could go to London and live in
England.

DOUG
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England
and I don't ever want to live there
again.


KATKA
I don't understand, it's your home?

DOUG
There's nothing there for me.

KATKA
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am.
Just take me with you, I don't care where.

Doug walks away from bars.

DOUG
Forget about me Kat.

KATKA
But I love you!

Doug comes back to the bars.
DOUG
It was a mistake, I never wanted to
hurt you, but it had to end sooner or
later and now, well now I love someone
else.

KATKA
No, it's not true, you're lying.

DOUG
Not this time, Kat. 

Katka's hands are on the bars and Doug comes back and holds them, they 
kiss through the bars. The cellblock door opens and there is a clink 
of keys as the OFFICER comes through.

OFFICER
(Subtitles)
Time up, come on, get out.

Doug breaks and Katka looks at the Officer.
DOUG
Bye!

Katka gives Doug a last tearful look before running off down the 
corridor and exiting.

you, while you are still our guest.

DOUG
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.

PAVEL
Really!

DOUG
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the
floppy disks.

Pavel smiles.
DOUG
They're going to be on their way to
Reuters this afternoon if I'm not
released by two o'clock.

Pavel laughs softly.
PAVEL
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late.
We have analyzed the contents of that
drum, the remains of the disks are there,
just as you said.

DOUG
Not all of them!

Doug gets a disk out of his pants and tosses it on the table, Pavel 
picks up the disk and inspects it.

DOUG
It's original and I've got seven others.
Now, do we talk or do we let Reuters figure
it out?

Pavel lays disk on the table and gets up from his chair and looks out 
of window, before turning back to Doug. Wall clock says ten o'clock.

PAVEL
You are playing a very dangerous game,
I suggest you make it easy on yourself
and tell me where they are.

DOUG
I didn't get to see what's on the disks
but I can guess. Do you want to hear my
terms or not.

Pavel pulls his pistol and sits down, resting the gun on the table.

DOUG
Look, I don't know where the disks are,
but if I don't walk free within four hours,
Reuters will get them.

Momentary silence.
PAVEL
What is it you want?

DOUG
First, I want to walk free with a
letter, in English, from the Prosecutor
General dropping all charges. Second,
I want two first class tickets to London
leaving tonight and three thousand crowns
in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions
against the students are to be stopped!

The Jeep skids around the end of the row of cars and Chris throws open 
the rear door. Doug looks over to the Jeep. The second of the TWO MEN 
moves clear of the car and takes another shot at Doug.

CHRIS
Come on!

Doug makes a run and another shot rings out. He dives into the rear 
seat and the Jeep screeches away. The TWO MEN shoot at the Jeep. One 
of the Jeep's side quarter-windows is blown out and a side quarter-
panel takes a hit. The TWO MEN run after the Jeep and take final 
shots. SHOW a Czech COUPLE looking on. Aerial view showing bleakness 
of the surroundings and the Jeep speeding off.

Chris checks Doug over who is lying down trying to catch his breath.

DOUG
God, I think I need a holiday.

CHRIS
Some deal you did there!

DOUG
I should have read the fine print.
(leaning over to Holly)
I love you Holly, thanks.

Doug reaches over and kisses Holly. The Jeep screeches to a halt and 
Holly turns around to embrace Doug.

CHRIS
What about me?

DOUG
Here!

Doug gets the baseball out of his pocket and puts it in Chris's face.

CHRIS
Come on guy's lets move it, please.

Holly accelerates the Jeep away.

DOUG
Where did you steal the car?

HOLLY
It's Josh's.

DOUG
Cool....Either of you know the way to
Krakow?

CHRIS
No, want me to ask a cop?

Doug puts his arms over Holly's shoulder.

DOUG
Just hit it!

Holly turns on the stereo.
