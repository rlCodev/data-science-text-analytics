					"These are the times that try men's souls:

								 Dec. 23, 1776



	SOUNDTRACK BEGINS: all 70's-style WHAMMY-BAR GUITAR,
	HIGH-HAT PERCUSSION and HORN SECTION, vibro-groovey...

	INT.  KITTLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

	6:00am on an ALARM CLOCK.  It BUZZES.

	CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS...

	In bed, under a black-light poster of Zodiac signs portrayed
	as sexual positions, KITTLE opens his eyes.  He's dashingly
	handsome, with a bushy moustache and big mutton chops.

	In the MIRROR ON THE CEILING: Kittle admires himself, then
	gets up, leaving behind a naked, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

						 KITTLE
				You should hit the bricks.

	The woman is starting to regret last night.

	IN THE KITCHEN, Kittle opens the fridge, puts a
	shrink-wrapped steak on the counter,  A carton of eggs.

	He lights a burner under a skillet.

	IN THE BEDROOM, the woman sits up, wraps herself in a sheet.
	She notices a PICTURE hung crooked on the wall:

	A PHOTO OF KITTLE in dress blues, fresh from the police
	academy; a Kittle once clean-cut, crew-cut and untainted.
	A Kittle long dead.

	IN THE KITCHEN, Kittle dumps the steak in the skillet.  He
	cracks eggs as the woman comes to pose in the doorway.

						 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
				Don't I even get breakfast?

	Kittle looks at her, smiles.

						 KITTLE
				No.

											 CUT TO:

	INT. BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- MORNING

	6:00am.  An ALARM CLOCK RINGS.  BILLY-BOY's already up, an
	outsized, scruffy-faced bruiser with mutton chops rivaling
	Kittle's.  He's lifting weights, naked, covered in sweat,
	smoking a cigarette.

	His gun and badge wait in a holster on a chair.

	Billy-Boy drops the barbells, executing kung-fu moves,
	poorly.  He chops at imaginary foes as he exits.  A moment
	later, he crosses back with a six-pack of beer...

	IN THE BATHROOM, Billy-Boy gets in the shower, guzzling a
	beer.  He tosses the empty, turns on the water...

	Blasted by the cold spray, Billy-Boy throws back his head
	and lets out a long, loud WAR HOOT.

											 CUT TO:

	INT. NENA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

	ALARM CLOCK.  6:00am again, as the ALARM BUZZES...

	In the satin-sheeted bed, a Siamese cat leaps up and rubs
	against NENA.  Nena rolls over, black and beautiful,
	straightens her power Afro.  She pets the cat, pushes away
	her pillow and picks up her GUN there.

	IN THE KITCHEN, Nena puts the gun down and fills a coffee
	pot at the sink.  The cat circles her ankles, purring.

	Nena opens a can of tuna, dumps it on a plate and puts it on
	the floor.  The cat eats.

	Nena opens the refrigerator where a photo of Bruce Lee is
	taped to the door.  She takes out a coffee jar, revealing a
	GUN hidden behind it on the shelf.

	In a cabinet, she pushes aside another GUN to get a mug.

	Nena sits at a table to wait for water to boil.  She picks
	thru a box of electronic bits and pieces, tinkering with a
	MICRO-TRANSMITTER, using a jeweler's eyepiece.  CAMERA MOVES
	down... REVEALS a HOLSTER screwed to the underside of table:
	another GUN within reach.

	IN THE BEDROOM, Nena enters with coffee.  She kneels
	cross-legged in a bean-bag chair, lights incense, then shuts
	her eyes and begins her morning meditation with a low hum.

											 CUT TO:

	INT. KITTLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

	At a mirror, Kittle ties his wide tie, combs his moustache.
	His suit is of the finest, loudest plaid.  He straightens
	the "Whip Inflation Now" BUTTON on his wide lapel.

	EXT. KITTLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

	Kittle strides toward garages behind his building, pointing
	a remote.  One GARAGE DOOR OPENS slowly.

	We CANNOT SEE INTO the DARK GARAGE as Kittle disappears
	inside.  We HEAR a CAR DOOR.  An ENGINE ROARS, RUMBLES,
	idling... a throaty GURGLE... till Kittle pulls out in his
	Ford Gran Torino GT...

	A small American flag on the antenna flaps in the breeze.

	The Torino swings onto the street, peeling out...
	ZOOM IN: as the Torino races away.  FREEZE FRAME.

	...CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS.

	EXT. H'WOOD STREETS -- MORNING -- AERIAL SHOT (ROOFTOPS)

	Kittle's Torino cruises down Vine past Capital Records.
	Traffic's light this early...

	WHIP PAN/ZOOM IN: on the "HOLLYWOOD" sign, distant.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -- MORNING

	Kids toss firecrackers in the gutter and watch them pop.
	Red, white and blue decorations are everywhere.

	SUPERIMPOSE TITLE CARD:

					 July 4th, 1976

	Nena walks down the sidewalk in a leather overcoat,
	sunglasses and ultra-flair bell-bottoms.  Shop-keepers
	raising storefront gates greet her.  Men crane their necks
	to watch her pass, wide-eyed and whistling.

	In the street, the Torino rounds a corner.  It pulls to the
	curb to meet Nena.  An elderly DRUNKARD's leering at Nena as
	she climbs in the car.

						 DRUNKARD
				Right on, Brown Sugar!  How 'bout
				taking me with you?

						 NENA
				Where I'm going today, Old Man, you
				do not want to go.

	As Kittle pulls away, u-turning...

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HAMBURGER STAND -- MORNING

	Alfresco greasy-spoon.  Under one R,W+B umbrella, Billy-Boy,
	in baggy suit and lollipop-orange aviator sunglasses,
	consumes a burger and looks lovey-eyed at his SCHOOL-MARM
	girlfriend, who reads a "MATH" text, innocent and petit.

	Across the street, Kittle's car pulls up, HONKING.
	Billy-Boy motions he'll be along in a minute.

	IN THE TORINO

	Nena's reading "Fear of Flying."  Kittle watches Billy-Boy.

						 KITTLE
				Look at her and him together.  King
				Kong and Fay Wray.

	Nena glances up, returns to reading.

						 NENA
				Whatever.

	Billy-Boy gives his girl an apple, kisses her.  Kittle lays
	on the horn.  Billy-Boy runs over with a cup of take-out
	coffee, carrying a newspaper under his arm.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Why do I always have to sit in back?

						 NENA
				It's just the way things are, kiddo.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Well, I would like to sit in front
				today.
 
						 NENA
				It's not gonna happen.

						 KITTLE
				Fer cryin' out loud, Billy-Boy, just
				get in the car.  You're way too big a
				target to be sitting up here.

	Billy-Boy gets in, disgruntled, handing the coffee to Nena
	who passes it to Kittle as the car sets in motion.
	Billy-Boy turns to look out the back, waving goodbye.
	Kittle watches thru the rearview mirror.

						 KITTLE
				How's your precious little
				school-marm today?

						 BILLY-BOY
				She's fine, as if you cared.

						 KITTLE
				Tell me something... what's a school
				teacher doing having you meet for
				breakfast in one of the filthiest
				parts of downtown skank-ville?  I
				mean, this is not the place for fine
				dining, unless looking at prostitutes
				stimulates your appetite.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Filthy kids go to kindergarten too.
				What are you saying, anyhow?

						 KITTLE
				Nothing, I guess.  Just an
				observation.  She's really something
				special.  You're a lucky fella.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Lay off once, would you?

						 KITTLE
				What'd I say?

						 BILLY-BOY
				It's the way you say it, like there's
				something more too it.

						 NENA
				You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?

						 BILLY-BOY
				Wha... ?

						 NENA
				Birth control's important.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(blushing, astonished)
				What... what kinda thing is that to
				say?

						 KITTLE
				She's right.  If you two are doing
				the horizontal polka, the last thing
				you want is a thirty-five pound
				bundle-of-joy stumbling around,
				knocking over furniture and calling
				you "daddy."

						 BILLY-BOY
					(beleaguered)
				Jeez... it's too early in the morning
				for this.  Leave off.
					(hands up newspaper)
				Here's your paper.

						 KITTLE
				What, am I supposed to read it while
				I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?

						 NENA
					(turns to Billy-Boy)
				You know, the more weight back there,
				the faster the car goes.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Bullshit.

						 NENA
				You never heard of physics, Einstein?
				The laws of physics.  The more
				ballast we keep closer to the rear
				tires...

						 BILLY-BOY
				I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you
				don't have to make up a buncha lies
				to make me feel good about it.

						 NENA
				Oh... okay.

	Nena faces front.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PORN SHOP/PEEP SHOW -- MORNING

	The Torino comes to halt at a seedy "ADULT BOOK SHOP."
	"Live Nude Girls."  Our heroes pile out of the car.
	Billy-Boy and Nena head in, but Kittle stops, incensed by a
	GEORGE WASHINGTON MANNEQUIN with an inflatable SEX-DOLL in
	its arms.  A sign above reads "Porn on the Fourth of July!"

	Kittle shoves the mannequin to the ground, then follows...

	INT.  PORN SHOP, ENTRANCE -- MORNING

	Billy-Boy, Nena and Kittle move briskly thru.  The PORN
	DEALER at the counter leaps to his feet, fearful.

						 PORN DEALER
				Hey, hey, hey, Kittle... I don't need
				no fucking hassle here!

						 KITTLE
					(pointing, furious)
				Then, sit your fat, sweaty ass back
				down in that chair!

	Porn Dealer obeys.

	INT.  PORN SHOP, PEEP SHOW BOOTHS -- MORNING

	Billy-Boy, Nena and Kittle push through beaded curtains into
	a dank hall.  They split up, opening doors, searching...

						 KITTLE
					(in thru a door)
				Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your
				thoughts in hand, huh... ?

						 NENA
					(into a booth)
				Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead
				and finish up.

	INT.  PORN SHOP, PEEP BOOTH -- MORNING

	A greasy, bespectacled pervert, BENNY, sits in a tiny booth,
	sweating in front of a window looking in on a top-less
	STRIPPER who gyrates without enthusiasm.

	A KNOCK, and Kittle sticks his head in.

						 KITTLE
				Sir, the management would like to
				offer a complimentary wet-nap...

	Benny turns, mortified.

						 KITTLE
				Hey, Benny!  How's it hanging?
				Well... you know, don't answer that.

	Kittle WHISTLES down the hall, then enters, friendly.

						 BENNY
				Kittle...

						 KITTLE
				Where you been hiding, grease-fist?
				We've been looking for you.

	Nena and Billy-B cram in, shut the door.  Very tight fit.

						 KITTLE
				You remember Nena and Billy-Boy.
					(BANGS on window)
				Take a break, sweetheart.

	The stripper goes to sit in a chair.

						 BENNY
				What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been
				clean a long time.
 
						 KITTLE
				Really?  Is that a fact... ?

	Kittle puts his gun to Benny's forehead, searches Benny's
	pockets, finding a bag of powder, which he hands over his
	shoulder to Nena.  Nena sticks in her pinkie, tastes it.

						 NENA
				Pure horse.

						 KITTLE
					(reholsters gun)
				You are such a disappointment, Benny.

	Nena sprinkles the powder to the floor

						 BENNY
				Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking
				fuckers!  What?  What do you want?

						 KITTLE
				Word is, while the vice cops on the
				East Coast were standing around
				playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of
				heroin got smuggled into New York
				City.  And, right now it's making a
				cross-country journey to Hollywood,
				U.S.A.

						 NENA
				Arriving tonight

						 KITTLE
				Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.

						 BENNY
				Look, I know how you guys operate,
				but I got a witness...
					(points to glass)
				I got a witness, so you can't squeeze
				me.

	The bored stripper smokes a cigarette, and just then a METAL
	DOOR SLIDES CLOSED over the window.  Peep show's over.

						 KITTLE
					(grins)
				Looks like your dime ran out.

	Kittle motions to Billy-Boy.  Billy-Boy squeezes past, lifts
	Benny by the lapels and shakes him violently.

						 BENNY
				Hey now... what the fuck... ?

						 KITTLE
				Again.

	Billy-Boy shakes Benny harder, really rattling him.

						 KITTLE
				Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's
				trying to jog your memory.

						 BENNY
				I don't know what you're talking
				about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not
				so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.

						 KITTLE
				This scag is enough to keep every
				junkie from here to the Mexican
				border high as a kite for the next
				two years.  You think we're gonna let
				Zimmermann haul it onto our streets
				on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?

						 NENA
				You must not think we take our
				responsibilities very seriously.

	Billy-Boy shakes Benny, and shakes him and shakes him...

						 KITTLE
				Last time Billy-Boy did this, the
				guy's neck broke...
					(SNAPS fingers)
				... just like that.  Sad in a way.
				Why is it we don't truly appreciate
				our arms and legs till we've lost the
				use of them?

						 BENNY
				Alright!  Alright... put me down...

	Billy-Boy looks to Kittle,  Kittle nods.  Billy-Boy puts
	Benny down.  Nena cozies up, starts combing Benny's hair
	over his bald spot, which is creeping him out.

						 BENNY
				It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's
				hurting.  The stuff floating around's
				been cut so many times it's like
				powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's
				gonna fix it.

						 KITTLE
				I need the "when" and the "where."

						 BENNY
				I don't know, okay?  All I know is
				Butch Cassidy's back in town.

						 NENA
				That's not what we heard.

						 BENNY
				He's back, swear to friggin' God.  I
				seen him at the needle farm saying
				how he's Zimmermann's number one
				candy-man again.  If anyone knows
				anything, he does.

						 KITTLE
				Airight... we'll take that.  But,
				start spreading the news...
					(pokes Benny's chest)
				Zimmermann goes down tonight.

	Nena and Billy-Boy exit.  Benny's relieved.  Kittle stops
	and tosses a handful of coins on the floor...
	    
						 KITTLE
				Knock yourself out.

	Kittle throws in a handkerchief, slams the door.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PORN SHOP -- MORNING

	Billy-Boy, Nena and Kittle get in the Torino.  They drive...

	INSIDE THE TORINO

	Kittle Sorts thru 8-track tapes on the dash.  He puts one
	into the player and twists volume.

	ON THE STREET

	Springsteen's "BORN TO RUN" (or some similar 70's anthem to
	cause all our hearts to skip a beat with cheap, easy,
	sentimental reminiscence) is HEARD KICKING IN...
	CAMERA FOLLOWS the Torino.

	TRACKING SHOT: of the stars on the dirty sidewalks of
	Hollywood Boulevard whizzing by.

	TRACKING SHOT: past a STREET VENDOR with a cart of flags,
	election buttons and dozens of R,W+B inflatable animals.

	WHIP PAN: to follow the Torino as it races past, then
	ZOOM IN: on the neon lettering of the "FROLIC ROOM" bar.

	TRACKING SHOT: past an x-rated theater double-billing "Alice
	in Wonderland" and "Behind the Green Door."

	TRACKING SHOT: past a shop window of televisions all showing
	Prez Ford speechifying.

	The Torino turns, cutting across a trash strewn lot.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS the Torino as it comes out to the street, but
	the MUSIC spiriting us thru this montage abruptly goes
	GARBLED and SLOWS to an EXTENDED GROAN...

	INSIDE THE TORINO

	Kittle looks down, pissed.

						 KITTLE
				What the fuck... ?

	He yanks the 8-track cassette.  The player spits ragged
	tape.  It's screwed.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SEEDY MOTEL/SUBURBAN STREETS -- MORNING

	Torino's parked.  Nena looks through binoculars...

						 NENA
				Come on, Butch... show your pretty
				face...

	NENA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

	Scanning curtained windows of a shit-hole MOTEL in bleak
	suburbs.  Various freaks and prostitutes hang out.

						 NENA (o.s.)
				Man-oh-man, this place is one hell of
				a skeeze-pad.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				Just breathing the air in there'll
				give you the clap.

	Kittle's still yanking tape from the cassette player,
	tossing it out.  Billy-Boy's smoking in back.

						 BILLY-BOY
				You shouldn't litter.

						 KITTLE
				Thank you, concerned citizen.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.

						 KITTLE
				I'll give you a fucking hoot if you
				don't shut up back there.

	Kittle turns on the RADIO: "Afternoon Delight" by Starlight
	Vocal Band.  He pushes another button: "Saturday Night" by
	the Bay City Rollers.

	Billy-Boy takes a swig from his pocket flask, snuffs his
	cigarette in an overflowing ashtray.

	Kittle tries other stations, frustration growing as the
	choices worsen: "Disco Duck" by Rick Dees.  "Popcorn."
	"Seasons in the Sun" by Terry Jacks.  Glen Campbell's
	"Rhinestone Cowboy."  "Don't Give Up On Us" by David Soul,

						 NENA
				Don't torture yourself...

	She turns the RADIO OFF, hands binoculars to Kittle and
	opens the newspaper.  Headline: ISRAELI COMMANDOS FREE
	HOSTAGES.  She pulls out a section, tossing it to Billy...

	The funny pages.  Billy-Boy starts reading them.

	Nena folds the paper over to the "HOROSCOPE."

						 KITTLE
				Why do you bother with that
				mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's
				writing it between bong hits, making
				it up as he goes, and you're actually
				taking the time to read it.

						 NENA
				Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...
					(reading)
				"Scorpio, October 24 to November 22:
				Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn,
				so proceed with caution..."

						 KITTLE
				Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get
				you every fucking time.

						 NENA
				"Today you have a rare opportunity to
				make a big difference in your chosen
				field.  By your able leadership and
				with great conviction and strength of
				character, you will come up a
				winner."

						 KITTLE
				Let me see that...
					(reads, impressed)
				Not bad.

	Kittle's pleased, looking back thru the binoculars.

						 BILLY-BOY
				What's mine say?

						 NENA
					(reading, to Billy)
				"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in
				alignment, so now is a perfect time
				for a vigorous regimen of self
				improvement.  Wash yourself more
				carefully each morning, stop using
				pies and cakes as your primary source
				of nourishment, and quit tucking your
				shirttails inside your underwear."

						 BILLY-BOY
				It doesn't say that.

						 NENA
				No, but it should.

	Kittle lowers the binoculars, searching his pockets.

						 KITTLE
				Hey, before I forget...

	He hands over two small boxes, wearing his sincerity on his
	sleeve.  Billy-Boy and Nena open the boxes, finding bright
	R,W+B "Spirit of '76" SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

						 KITTLE
					(pridefully modest)
				Just a little, you know...
				Bicentennial memento.  Nothing
				special.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool.
				They'll be collector's items.

						 NENA
					(unenthused)
				Yeah... great.

						 KITTLE
				You know... you could say thank you.

						 NENA
				You're the one with the star-spangled
				hard-on, not me.

						 KITTLE
				What are you, communist?  At least
				numb-nuts here has the courtesy to
				pretend he likes them.

	    Kittle looks back through binoculars.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Hey...

						 NENA
				Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels
				over commemorative salt and pepper
				shakers

						 KITTLE
				I just think you should show some
				respect.  I mean, call me old
				fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben
				Franklin and those guys signed the
				Constitution and Declaration of
				Independence, they did that so we
				could all share in the freedom...

						 NENA
				First of all, the Constitution wasn't
				writtem till 1787...

						 KITTLE
				You know what I mean.

						 NENA
				Second of all, the Declaration of
				Independence was all for liberty and
				equality, but it didn't do anything
				about slavery, did it?

						 KITTLE
					(stymied)
				Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They
				couldn't go doing everything at once.

						 NENA
				All I'm saying is, your little
				Bicentennial mementos would be more
				accurate if there were no holes in
				the pepper shaker so the pepper
				couldn't get out.

						 KITTIE
				Let's drop it, alright?

						 NENA
				Sure.

						 KITTLE
				Alright?

						 NENA
				Absolutely.

	Kittle looks back through binoculars.

	AT THE SEEDY MOTEL

	A hairy nan in only shorts gets a paper from a coin box.  On
	a balcony, a door opens... someone's coming out...

	ZOOM IN: on BUTCH CASSIDY, a sorry-looking transvestite
	hustler in blonde wig, smeared lipstick and cowboy hat.

						 KITTLE (o.s.)
				Butch Cassidy rides again.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle lowers binoculars.  Billy-Boy sits forward.

						 BILLY-BOY
				That's him alright.

						 NENA
				It's go time, Billy-B.

	Billy-Boy climbs out, brings a GOLF CLUB as a weapon.

						 KITTLE
				Escort everyone's favorite She-Male
				over here nice and peaceful-like.
				Let's not have another incident like
				at the laundromat.  I'll never forget
				the look on that poor woman's face.

						 BILLY-BOY
				That wasn't my fault.

						 KITTLE
				Save it.  Just go.

	ON THE STREET

	Billy-Boy treks toward the motel.

	Up the block, Butch Cassidy greets other hookers in front of
	the motel, slaps "five."

	Billy-Boy crosses the street, hides the club behind him.
	Ahead, a CUSTOMIZED VAN with a Spiderman mural painted on
	the side pulls up, stops across the street from the motel.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle frowns.

	ON THE STREET

	Billy-Boy picks up the pace.  Ahead, Butch Cassidy seems to
	notice him, tries to act casual, heading to the street.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
					(under his breath)
				Don't let him get to the van.

	ON THE STREET

	Butch is going towards the van.  Billy-Boy starts
	run-walking, far from inconspicuous.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle grips the steering wheel.

						 KITTLE
				Don't let him get to the van.

	ON THE STREET

	Butch Cassidy looks to Billy-Boy, runs.  Billy-Boy sprints.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle leans out, shouting.

						 KITTLE
				Don't let him get to the fucking van!
 
	ON THE STREET

	Butch Cassidy jumps in the van as it does a screaming
	u-turn.  Billy-Boy throws his golf club in frustration.

	Kittle starts the Torino and peels out just as the van rages
	past in the other direction.

	Billy-Boy runs back.  The Torino heads towards him, spins...
	Nena throws open the door...

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy scrambles in back.

						 NENA
				Smooth move, hot-shot.

						 BILLY-BOY
				What was I supposed to do?

						 KITTLE
				Lose some weight.

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino roars forward.  The van's got a good lead.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle hits the SIREN.  Nena mounts the spinning DOME LIGHT.
	In back, Billy-Boy grips half his seatbelt.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I... I can't find my seatbelt.

						 KITTLE
				What do you want me to do about it?

	ON THE STREET

	The van zooms through an intersection, dipping hard.  A few
	beats later, the Torino follows, bouncing...

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy's head SLAMS roof.  He yelps, gripping his skull.

	ON THE STREET

	FOLLOW the high speed pursuit...

	Jerking corners.

	The van burns a 4-way stop.  A VW Bug starts to cross...

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy's looking down as he fastens his seatbelt.
	Nena points at the VW...

						 NENA
				Look out!

	Kittle hits brakes...

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino stops, inches from the Bug.

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy lurches, hitting his face on the seat in front of
	him and rebounding.  He clutches his forehead.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Stop that!

	Kittle pounds the horn.  Nena's yelling.  The Bug moves.

						 NENA
				Go, go, go!

	Kittle zooms around.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET, FURTHER ON -- CHASE CONTINUES

	The van takes a corner, careening off a parked car...

	The van races on.  However, ahead...

	A car backs out of a driveway, blocking the street.

	The van brakes hard, throwing smoke, HORN BLARING.

	Behind, the Torino rounds the corner...

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				We got him.

						 NENA
				Slow down.

						 KITTLE
				"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up
				your mind.

						 NENA
				Don't crowd him.

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino closes in.  The van's rear doors open...

	ZOOM IN: a tie-dyed HIPPY in the van leveling a SHOTGUN...

	In the Torino, Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy see him...

						 KITTLE
				Down!

	Kittle, Mama and Billy-Boy duck as the Torino brakes.

	The hippy BLASTS...

	A hole EXPLODES in the Torino's windshield.

	The Torino stops.  Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy sit up.

						 NENA
				Hate to say I told you so.

	The van's reverse lights come on, tires spinning...

	Kittle reacts, puts the Torino in reverse...

	The van picks up speed, doors jerking closed, chasing the
	Torino backwards down the block...

	Nena kicks hard -- jettisons the ruined windshield.

	INSIDE THE VAN

	The VAN DRIVER uses the side rearview to see.  Butch
	Cassidy, in the passenger seat, looks to the back where the
	Hippy's kneeled on a WATERBED and reloading.

						 BUTCH CASSIDY
				What the fuck you doin'?  They're
				pigs!  You can't kill no cops!

						 HIPPY
				Watch me.

	ON THE STREET

	Kittle's going full speed reverse.  Nena FIRES her gun into
	the back of the van.

	Other cars brake as the Torino rockets backwards thru an
	intersection.  The van arrives similarly, sliding...

	The van burns rubber, chooses another street, forward.

	IN THE TORINO

	Nena reloads with a speed loader.  Kittle shifts gear,
	blasting onwards to follow.

						 KITTLE
				Sons of bitches!

						 BILLY-BOY
				We catch 'em, I wanna be first to
				hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go
				first.

						 KITTLE
				We'll share.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  CANYON ROADWAY -- CHASE CONTINTES

	The van hits the road's crest, airborne...

	Lands hard, heading downhill, south into a canyon.

	The Torino follows, flying... bottoming out.

	The road twists radically.  Kittle brings the Torino
	close... nudges the van's rear.

	The van SCRAPES guardrail, throws sparks, straightens.

	IN THE TORINO

	Wind whips thru the car.  Nena gets onto the hood, halfway
	out, biting her lip and aiming two guns,

						 KITTLE
				Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need
				Butch Cassidy alive, remember?

						 NENA
				Shit.  You're right.

	Nena considers, disappointed.

						 KITTLE
				If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You
				can shoot him in the leg or
				something.

						 NENA
				Let's hope.

	ON CANYON ROAD

	The van and Torino barrel downhill, barely controlled.
	Opposing traffic zips past.

	Kittle rams from behind again.  The van's doors open...

	The Hippy tries to aim, shifting to and fro.
	The Torino backs off.

	INSIDE THE VAN

	Butch Cassidy gets out of his seat, moves back...

						 BUTCH CASSIDY
				You crazy fucking junkie!

	Butch KICKS the Hippy from behind...

	ON CANYON ROAD
	    
	The Hippy hits the street, rolls...
	Screaming as...

	The Torino's grillwork rushes to meet him.

	INSIDE THE TORINO

	The car BOUNCES -- BUMPITY-THUD -- as the Hippy is crushed.

	Billy-Boy looks back as the body disappears around a bend,

						 BILLY-BOY
				Ouch.

	Billy-Boy unhooks the POLICE RADIO microphone beside him.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(into mic)
				Central, car 1-5-5 requests an
				ambulance
					(looks back)
				Uh... ambulance emergency at Canyon
				Boulevard and...

	He tries to spot a cross street.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(into mic, at a loss)
				Um... we're on Canyon where it's
				really... twisty, turny.

	ON CANYON ROAD

	FOLLOW the van and Torino.  The road's curves are extreme.
	It's all the Torino can do to stay close.

	Taking a turn wide, the van DECIMATES mailboxes.

	The Torino follows through fluttering letters.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				That's a federal offense right there;
				tampering with the U.S  mail!

	Kittle girds his loins, eyeing the opposite lane.

						 KITTLE
				I'm gonna get beside him.

						 NENA
					(worried)
				No you're not.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(equally fearful)
				That's a bad plan.

	Kittle loosens his tie.

						 KITTLE
				I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're
				gonna shoot out his tires.

						 NENA
				No, we are not going to do that.

	Kittle accelerates.  ENGINE ROARS...

	ON CANYON ROAD

	The Torino inches into the opposite lane, is forced to
	retreat because of oncoming traffic.

	The Torino tries again, but a pick-up truck's coming...

	Misses by inches, side mirror SMASHED!  Kittle recoils.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
					(determined)
				I can work this.

						 BILLY-BOY
				No you can't.

						 KITTLE
				Get ready.

						 NENA
				I hate you.

	ON CANYON ROAD

	Brief straightaway.  Kittle speeds up...

	The Torino comes along the van's left side...

	Nena puts her guns out, aiming for tire...

	AHEAD:  a motorcycle speeding straight at the Torino!

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle's eyes widen.

	Nena sees the cycle.

	Kittle jerks the wheel left.

	Nena pulls her arms in just as...

	ON CANYON ROAD

	The motorcycle somehow fits between the van and Torino.

	The Torino returns to its proper lane behind the van.

	IN THE TORINO

	Nena looks at Kittle, seething.  Kittle won't look at her.

						 NENA
				You... SUCK!  You almost got us all
				killed!

						 KITTLE
				You think this is so easy?

						 NENA
				Can't be worse than you.

						 KITTLE
				Oh yeah?

						 NENA
				That's right, white bread.  Give it
				up.  Right now.

						 KITTLE
				Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go
				getting your panties in a knot...

	Kittle peers forward, THRU WINDSHIELD: pretty straight road.

						 KITTLE
				Make a hole, Billy-Boy.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I'd rather you guys didn't do this
				again.

						 KITTLE
				Move it!

	Billy-Boy reluctantly slides behind Nena as she reaches to
	hold the wheel...

						 KITTLE
				Go!

	Simultaneously: Kittle scrambles over the front seat to the
	back and Nena hops into the driver's seat.

						 NENA
				Now we're taking a ride.

	She shifts, ENGINE GROWLING.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  COMMERCIAL STREET -- CHASE CONTINUES

	Store fronts and businesses.  The van takes a corner, dodges
	other cars...

	The Torino pursues, Nena at the wheel.

	The van faces a mini-traffic jam.  Nowhere to go, except...

	Up on the sidewalk, CLOBBERING a parking meter.

	Nena follows without hesitation, jumps the curb.

	On the sidewalk, PEDESTRIANS scatter, screaming.

	The van BLASTS through the obligatory NEWSSTAND...

	Up ahead: FRUIT STAND... DESTROYED...

	The van hits the cross street... BOUNCES over a median
	strip, burning rubber.  The Torino's behind, HORN BLOWING...

	Civilian vehicles panic skid, CRASHING parked cars,

	The upcoming intersection shows a red light.  Too bad.  The
	van SLAMS a crossing car, exploding onward.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle climbs up to the front passenger seat.

						 KITTLE
				Get closer!  Don't lose him!

						 NENA
				I kinda already figured that, but
				keep those helpful hints coming.

	ON A CROSS STREET

	The van takes a sharp turn, tooling up a HIGHWAY ON-RAMP...

	EXT.  ELEVATED HIGHWAY -- CHASE CONTINUES

	... onto the freeway.  Relatively clear sailing ahead.

	IN THE VAN

	Butch Cassidy looks in his rearview.

	THROUGH MIRROR: the Torino rises on the horizon.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	It's all R.P.M.'s here.  80mph... 85mph and climbing.
	The Torino's closing the gap.

	IN THE VAN

	Butch Cassidy climbs across the waterbed, opening a utility
	box by the wheel-well... finds the van's JACK.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino zig-zags past other cars.

	IN THE TORINO

	The world outside's a blur.

						 KITTLE
					(motions with hands)
				You put your bumper just behind his
				left tire and then accelerate... make
				him spin out...

						 NENA
				Is there nothing in this world you
				enjoy more than the sound of your own
				voice?

	In back, Billy-Boy's looking out, sweaty scared.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(to himself)
				This is too fast.
					(to Kittle and Nena)
				This is way too fast!

						 KITTLE
				Relax.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(grips Kittle's shoulder)
				We should slow down.

						 KITTLE
				Hands off the suit, monkey-boy.
				Close your eyes if you're scared.

	Billy-Boy sits back, digs up his "Pittsburgh Steelers"
	football helmet and straps it on.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The van and Torino blast past.

	IN THE VAN

	Butch Cassidy's at the head of the waterbed with the jack
	rigged under the frame, pumping the handle...

	The frame lifts in front; angled so the waterbed's sliding
	and sloshing... bunching up at the rear doors.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino increases velocity.

	IN THE VAN

	Butch Cassidy locks the jack, climbs over the frame and
	slides down, stomping on the blob-like waterbed.

	He grips a strap on the ceiling and kicks at the rear door
	handle, but misses.  Kicks again.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino's directly behind.  The van's doors open...

	IN THE TORINO

	Nena, Kittle and Billy-Boy see what's about to happen.

						 KITTLE
				Oh shit!

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The waterbed flops out on tbe road...

	The Torino COLLIDES in an EXPLOSION OF WATER...
	Spins out of control...

	Skids backwards on the shoulder, scraping the guardwall till
	it finally comes to a halt.

	IN THE TORINO

	Dazed pause.  Nena, Kittle and Billy-Boy are drenched.

						 KITTLE
				Alright... you had your chance,
				sister.  Make room for Kittle...

	Nena climbs in back.  Kittle takes the wheel.

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino spits shoulder gravel, u-turning... causing other
	cars to make drastic moves to avoid.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle accelerates, shifting gear, focused.

						 KITTLE
				The time has come...
					(shifts gear)
				... for asses to be kicked.

	He shifts again.  ENGINE DEAFENING...

	SPEEDOMETER: 65mph... 70mph... 75mph...

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	FAR AHEAD: the van.  Butch Cassidy sticks his head out the
	window, holds his hat, looking back.

						 BUTCH CASSIDY
				Fuck me...

	Indeed.  The Torino's far back, but coming on strong.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				Firepower, Billy-Boy

	Billy-Boy swigs from his flask.  He opens a trap door in the
	seat beside him, reaching back in the trunk to produce a
	sawed-off shotgun, which he hands up to Nena.

	SPEEDOMETER: vibrating at 99mph... 105mph...

	ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino's getting close to the van, looks like it's gonna
	pass on the right.  The van moves to block...

	Kittle twists the wheel...
	Coming around the van's left side...
	    
	Nena points the shotgun...

	The Torino overtakes the van...

	Nena fires -- BOOM -- the van's back tire is OBLITERATED!

	The van fishtails, out of control...

	The van crosses six lanes left, then crosses right back,
	straight at the concrete GUARDWALL...

	CRASHES into the guardwall -- the van driver flies through
	the windshield like a human cannonball, thrown off the
	elevated highway...

	ON A SURFACE STREET BELOW

	A TRUCK DRIVER sits in traffic, whistles a tune.
	PULL BACK to REVEAL: he's in a GLASS TRUCK loaded down with
	great, big, perfect sheets of glass, just as...

	The van driver soars from above -- SHATTERING EVERYTHING!

	UP ON THE HIGHWAY

	The Torino skids to halt on the shoulder.

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy run back to look down to where
	people gather around the glass accident.

						 BILLY-BOY
				 Jiminy Christmas.

						 KITTLE
				 I can not even begin to imagine how
				 much that must have hurt.

	At the van, a door opens and Butch Cassidy stumbles out, wig
	askew, bleeding.  He runs across the highway...

						 NENA
					(sees Butch)
				You got to be kidding.

	Nena whips out a gun, FIRES a warning shot.

						 NENA
				Halt, jackass!

	Butch keeps going.  Nema takes quick aim, SHOOTS...

	Butch's leg is knocked out from under him.  He hits the
	median, moaning.  Cars rush past.

						 KITTLE
					(to Nena)
				Told you you'd get to shoot him.
					(heads to car,
					 to Billy-Boy)
				Think you can pick him up without all
				the bells and whistles this time,
				Big-Boy?  Thanks.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- MORNING

	The wounded Torino rides up at the precinct house.

	At the underground garage, JOE MECHANIC, in greasy overalls,
	jaws with cops.  He spots the Torino coming.

						 JOE MECHANIC
				Ah, Jeez, here we go again...

						 KITTLE
				Sorry, Joe.  These things happen.

	Kittle gets out.  Nena and Billy-Boy drag out the battered
	Butch Cassidy in a gag and handcuffs.

						 KITTLE
					(tosses keys)
				Pop in a windshield and bang out the
				dents.  I need it quick.

						 JOE MECHANIC
					(gets in Torino)
				This car loves you, Kittle.  Why do
				you treat it so bad?

						 KITTLE
				Fear of commitment.

	Joe drives the Torino into the underground garage.

	Billy-Boy and Nena bring Butch Cassidy up the precinct house
	stairs.  Kittle follows,  Cops come and go.  FRIEND COP
	comes out, a young, fresh-faced model citizen in uniform.

						 FRIEND COP
				Kittle!?

	Kittle's elated to see Friend Cop, bear-hugging him.

						 KITTLE
				Hey, squirt!  Goddamn, it's good to
				see you.  How you been?

						 FRIEND COP
				Can't complain, but I will if you
				give me half a chance.

						 KITTLE
				You met my partners... ?
					(to Nena and Billy-B)
				This here's Harry McDoogle's kid.
				Fresh out of the academy.  Top of the
				class and best scores on the pistol
				range to boot.

	Billy-Boy and Nena greet him and shake hands.  Meanwhile...

	DOWN THE BLOCK

	A CADILLAC Eldorado rounds the corner.  TWO VILLAINS in
	front.  ONE VILLAIN in back.  All in suits and ski-masks.

	ON THE PRECINCT STAIRS

						 KITTLE
					(positively beaming)
				Your pop must be proud of you.  Look
				at ya, ya short-shaver...

	Kittle takes off Friend Cop's hat, ruffles his crew-cut.

						 KITTLE
				Finally got a haircut.  Hell, you
				look almost respectable.

						 FRIEND COP
					(laughing)
				Almost, right?
					(of Butch Cassidy)
				Looks like you got your hands full.

						 KITTLE
				Buckaroo's going downstairs for a
				little "chit-chat."  Gonna tell us
				all about Zimmermann's big score...
					(removes Butch's gag)
				Aren't you, Butch-Butch?

						 BUTCH CASSIDY
				Suck my dick.

						 KITTLE
					(stuffs gag back)
				He's disgruntled right now, but he'll
				come around.

	ON THE STREET

	The Cadillac speeds up...

					SPLIT-SCREEN:

	ON THE STAIRS (SLO-MO):	    ON THE STREET (SLO-MO):
	Nena sees danger, shouts	   MACHINE GUNS point from
	a warning...				the windows of the Cadillac.

	Friend Cop spots the		  The Ski-masked VILLAINS
	Cadillac and starts to		open fire -- flame erupting
	draw his gun...			  from their weapons, rapid
							  fire: BLASTING and BLASTING
	Billy-Boy dives forward...	 and BLASTING and BLASTING
							  and BLASTING, non-stop...

	Butch Cassidy's hit...
	blood exploding from his	   VILLAINS keep FIRING, teeth
	body and splattering...	    bared through their masks...

	Billy-Boy tackles Kittle...	Machine guns retorting...
							  spent shells flying...
	Nena hits the dirt.		   gun barrels spitting death.

	Friend Cop's gun is only	   BLASTING...
	halfway up when bullets	    BLASTING...
	slap him in the chest and	  BLASTING...
	BLOOD spurts!  (Straight-	  BLASTING...
	from-the-bucket red paint	  BLASTING...
	blood, like all 70's blood.)
	    
	Billy-Boy lands on the		BLASTING ceaselessly...
	ground with Kittle in
	his arms.				   The Cadillac accelerates,
							  GUNS still FIRING...

	Butch Cassidy does a dance
	of death as glass doors	    Machine guns are withdrawn,
	behind him SHATTER.		   smoke wafting.

				  SPLIT-SCREEN ENDS as...

	Butch Cassidy goes flying thru the precinct doors.

	Friend Cops falls, coughing blood.

	Billy-Boy leaps to his feet, enraged...

	Nena rises to follow...

	Billy-Boy and Nena draw weapons as they bound down the
	stairs, chasing the Cadillac, SHOOTING.

	On the stairs, Kittle sees Friend Cop down.  Horror.

	Billy-Boy and Nena keep running and FIRING, but...
	The Cadillac escapes round a corner.

	Kittle comes to Friend Cop's body, cradles him.

						 KITTLE
				No... come on, kid.  Come on...
					(feels for pulse)
				No...

	Friend Cop's dead.  Kittle squeezes him, eyes filling with
	tears, anguished fury building...

						 KITTLE
					(to the heavens)
				Noooooooooooo...!!

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET, A FEW BLOCKS AWAY -- MORNING

	FOLLOW the Cadillac's escape.  Villains remove ski-masks...

	INSIDE THE CADILLAC

	In front, there's MICKEY, evil, with spiked blonde hair and
	wrap-around sunglasses, and BALLS, eviller, a lip-less
	dullard in a fez hat and turtle-neck sweater.  In back,
	there's POE, evilest, one dangerous-looking bastard; a
	circus freak giant in a pink polyester three-piece suit.

						 POE
				Nice job, boys.  Iced a bonus cop in
				the bargain.

	He dips his gold-plated pinkie-nail in a vial, snorts coke.

						 POE
				Groovey.

	He grins, has a bunch of teeth missing in front.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  POSH CLUB, RESTAURANT -- MORNING

	Windowless, wood-paneled walls showcase fine oil paintings.
	QUIET MUSIC PLAYS.  It's a staid club, isolated from the
	outside world.  Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy push thru the
	front doors, blowing by the MAITRE D'.

						 MAITRE D'
				Excuse me, sir.

						 KITTLE
				You're excused.

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy stop, scanning the restaurant.
	The maitre d' catches up, blocking, calmly superior.

						 MAITRE D'
				Sirs and madam... I assure you you're
				not welcome here,  This is a very
				exclusive, private club.

						 KITTLE
				So is this...

	Kittle shows his badge, moving on...
	Snobby, upper-crusty PATRONS look up with disapproval from
	their R,W+B centerpieced tables as our heroes stride to...

	The table in the rear corner, where ZIMMERMANN is flanked by
	TWO BIMBOS, Mickey, Balls, Poe and other THUGS.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Well, well... if it isn't the Justice
				League of America.

	Zimmermann is a jewelry-adorned, Truman Capote-ish
	drug-czar, sinister and calm.  Balls stands, looking tough.

	Billy-Boy picks up speed, SHOVES Balls with both hands...

	Sends Balls stumbling violently backwards, CRASHING into and
	FLIPPING over another table, to the dismay of patrons.

						 KITTLE
					(to Balls)
				Don't get up on our account.
					(to Zimmermann)
				Mind if we join you, Zimmermann?

	Kittle sits.  Thugs are edgy.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Be my guest.
					(to bimbos)
				Ladies... go powder your beaks.

	The Bimbos go as Nena and Billy-Boy sit.  Balls rises,
	wiping scrambled eggs off his suit, furious.  Zimmermann
	waves him off, and Balls acquiesces, skulking away.

						 NENA
				How you been, Poe?

						 POE
				Better than ever, chickie.

						 NENA
				Still haven't fixed those front
				choppers, huh?  Guess you're digging
				that hillbilly look.

						 KITTLE
				We probably should give 'em back...
				but Billy-Boy seems to think they're
				some kinda good luck charm.

	Billy-Boy holds up a tiny jar with teeth inside, rattles
	them at Poe.  Poe remains impassive.

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(still eatimg)
				What can we do for you, officers?
				What new, mindless harassments have
				you planned this morning?

						 KITTLE
				Just wanted to make you aware...
				before today's over, we'll be
				standing on top of your mountain of
				horse and pissing down on you.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Thank you for sharing that charming
				image.

						 NENA
				Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.

						 BILLY-BOY
				You'll cry like a great big,
				blubbering baby.

	Zimmermann laughs, dabs his mouth with his napkin.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				You three...
					(shakes head, amazed,
					 addresses the table)
				Narcotics have been around since
				before 4000 B.C.  Marijuana was a
				major crop in colonial North America.
				Wars have been waged over opium, and
				still... in spite of it...
					(motions to trio)
				... into that timeline of thousands
				of years come three vice cops
				determined to change the course of
				human history.

	Thugs laugh derisively.  Kittle struggles to mask anger.

						 KITTLE
				Couldn't have said it better myself.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				You bust some small-time pimps,
				whores and dime-bag junkies, like the
				world's a better place because you're
				in it.  And for what, Kittle... two
				hundred and fifty dollars a week?
				Tell me, how does anyone get so
				self-rightious when they can barely
				afford to pay their rent?

						 KITTLE
				Just 'cause you belong to some
				fancy-pants club, doesn't make you
				any less a murderer.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Murderer?  Really?

						 NENA
				You're stealing people's lives,
				pusher-man.
				You might be killin' them so slow
				they think they're being saved, but
				down that road, they're just as dead.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Live under whichever delusion you
				choose, you'll never touch me.
				You're not smart enough.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Shove it up your ass.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				And always with the witty rejoinder.
				Touche'!
					(picks up menu)
				Let me treat you to brunch.  You'll
				need your strength.

						 KITTLE
				Thanks, but we don't recognize
				"brunch" as an actual meal.

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(looking at menu)
				I insist.  What will it be?  Boston
				Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the
				Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu?
				No...
				   (tosses menu)
				There's a special on the menu, today
				only...
					(pointedly, to Kittle)
				... roasted pig.

	Kittle does a slow boil...

	FLASHBACK -- PRECINCT HOUSE STAIRS -- TWO SCENES AGO

	Friend Cop's gun is only halfway up when bullets slap him in
	the chest and BLOOD spurts... !

	BACK TO SCENE IN POSE CLUB

	All at once, IN SLOW MOTION:
	Kittle stands, enraged, pulling his gun...

	Poe pulls his gun...

	Nena shoves her hands in her overcoat pockets...

	Billy-Boy reaches both hands cross-armed into his jacket...

	Kittle levels his gun at Zimmermann.

	Poe puts his gun to Kittle's temple.

	Billy-Boy points two guns at Mickey just as Mickey raises
	his gun and puts it in Billy-Boy's face.

	Nena brings her hands thru pocket holes, shrugging her coat,
	pointing two sawed-off shotguns on shoulder straps.

	Several thugs freeze, eye-to-eye with Nena's shotguns.

	END SLO-MO.  Stalemate.  Waiters and patrons freak, clearing
	out, screaming.  The eye of the storm:

						 KITTLE
				I could end a whole lotta suffering
				right now.

						 POE
				And your friends' lives.

	Zimmermann calmly stares down Kittle's gun, brings a forkful
	of meat to his south and chews.  Kittle wants to pull the
	trigger so badly, shaking, sweat dripping down his face.

	But, Kittle reins his anger in...  backs off.

						 KITTLE
				Your poison's not gonna make it into
				the veins of any kids this time.
	    
						 ZIMMERMANN
				Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming
				those dreams.

	Kittle leads Nena and Billy-Boy out, past frightened
	employees.  Thugs return to their seats.

	SLOW ZOOM IN: as Zimmermann allows an edge of anger.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Something needs to be done about
				them, once and for all.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MAIN LOBBY -- MORNING

	The precinct's busy with cops and jabbering weirdoes in
	custody.   Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy move thru the
	boarded-over front doors, crossing...

	All around, other cops are giving dirty looks to our trio.

	Near the duty desk, OFFICER STEVE, a square-jawed uniform
	cop, nudges his intense, crew-cut partner, OFFICER JIM.
	These are blue-blooded, boots-polished, buttons-shined cops.

	Officer Steve points out Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy.

						 OFFICER JIM
					(with disdain)
				Whoop-de-do, there they go. Strutting
				in like they're better than us.

						 OFFICER STEVE
				They're a disgrace.

						 OFFICER JIM
				It's their kind of... of...
				overzealous antics that give cops a
				bad name.

	Officer Steve nods in full agreement.

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy near double doors.  A
	grumpy-looking plain-clothes HOMICIDE COP is heading the
	opposite direction, chomping on a peanut-butter and jelly
	sandwich.  His eyes light up when he spots Billy-Boy.

						 HOMICIDE COP
					(mouth full, to Billy)
				Hey, big man... how's the last of the
				red hot lovers?

	Billy-Boy's confused.  Homicide Cop's jolly, like they're in
	on a private joke.  Problem is, Billy-Boy's not in on it.

						 HOMICIDE COP
					(off Billy-B's confusion)
				That girlie of yours... she's
				one-in-a-million, I'll tell you.  How
				you lucked into that, I'll never
				know.  You must be one gifted
				cocksman.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I don't... what... !??

	But, Homicide Cop's beading on, winking and clicking his
	tongue in lascivious appreciation.  Billy-Boy hasn't a clue,
	moving to keep up with Nena and Kittle.

	INT.  PRECINCT, VICE BULLPEN -- MORNING

	A stereotypically busy room of overburdened bulletin boards
	and file cabinets.  As Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy enter, we
	WHIP PAN: to middle-aged CAPT. ALBERT, who points angrily.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				My office!  Now!

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- MORNING

	Captain Albert slams the door, circles Kittle, Nena and
	Billy-B as they sit.  The graying DISTRICT ATTORNEY RAVICH
	stands with arms crossed, looking out the window.

						 D.A. RAVICH
				I turned on my t.v., and I expected
				to see Los Angeles brimming with
				jubilation.  I expected children with
				painted faces.  Men and women in
				Bicentennial garb.  Multi-ethnic
				marching bands.  Pie eating contests.
				All good things American. I turned on
				my t.v., and what did I see instead?
					(turns to cops)
				A corpse was scraped off Canyon Road
				after Lord knows how many cars ran
				over the carcass.  And in a related
				story, a high speed chase ended when
				the suspect was thrown from the
				highway to his death.

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy exchange looks, a bit sheepish.

						 D.A. RAVICH
				And, what... what am I forgetting?
				Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie
				whose bullet riddled body came
				blasting through the front doors of
				the precinct house!

						 KITTLE
				Well, sir...

						 D.A. RAVICH
				No.  Don't open your mouth!  You
				honestly think you can explain this
				to my satisfaction?

						 KITTLE
				I... I think I can... clarify...

						 D.A. RAVICH
				Don't bother.  This behavior's gone
				on too long.  You're suspended.

						 KITTLE
				What?

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				You heard the man...

	Captain Albert points at a CLOCK.  12 noon.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				It's noon straight up.  Effective
				immediately, you three work desk jobs
				till midnight.

						 NENA
				You can't be serious.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				Can't I?

						 NENA
				We've been chasing this deal six
				months, and now you're gonna chuck it
				out the window?

	SLOW ZOOM IN: on Kittle as he stands up.

						 KITTLE
				Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the
				same page here.  This shipment is do
				or die for Zimmermann's syndicate;
				all or nothing.  If we stop the
				drugs, we don't even have to catch
				him red-handed.  He's ruined cause
				his pushers go broke with nothing to
				sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck
				this up, it means more zombies
				crawling the gutters than ever and a
				morgue that doesn't have a single
				empty drawer.  More old ladies
				getting mugged and molested by
				junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all
				the while Zimmermann's sitting back
				and laughing his head off.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				There'll be other chances.

						 KITTLE
				Not like this.  Are you even
				listening?

						 D.A. RAVICH
				I will not allow your obsession to
				turn a day of pride and celebration
				into a day of wholesale slaughter.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(rising)
				May I say something... ?

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				No!

	Billy-Boy sits back down.  Kittle's fed up.

						 KITTLE
				Don't you condescend to tell me how
				or why to honor Independence Day, and
				don't tell me I'm overreacting when
				I'm trying to bust the guy
				responsible for half the filthy junk
				coming into this city!

						 D.A. RAVICH
				You're about an inch away from
				insubordination!

						 KITTLE
				Well... seeing how you just suspended
				me, what's to stop me from calling
				you a crazy bastard, you old fart?

						 D.A. RAVICH
					(bottled fury)
				Till the last firework fizzles out
				tonight, detective, you sit a desk.
				And, after that, I'll decide if you
				keep your shield.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MEN'S BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy storm in.  Cops at sinks and
	urinals look up.  Kittle motions them out.

	Nena goes to sit on the window ledge, worried, while
	Billy-Boy checks stalls.  The other cops exit, irritated,

						 KITTLE
				I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Well... we shouldn't rush into this,
				right?  Let's talk about it.

						 KITTLE
				What are you, Henry friggin'
				Kissinger all the sudden?

						 BILLY-BOY
				I'm just saying...

						 KITTLE
				You're just saying nothing!  Tonight
				is the night.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll
				take our badges.

						 KITTLE
				What of it?  Haven't we waited
				forever... ?
					(turns to Nena)
				Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited
				long enough to get this scumbag?

	Nena looks down.  She's having doubts.

						 KITTLE
				What... ?  Not you too?

						 NENA
				He's right.  We hit the bricks, we
				walk back triple-fucked.

						 KITTLE
				I can't believe I'm hearing this,

						 NENA
				I worked my ass off for my badge,
				Kittle,  It's the only thing that
				makes me different from every other
				slob out there.

						 KITTLE
				That's not true.

						 NENA
				I know it is, even if you don't.

						 BILLY-BOY
				All I got is being a cop.  What do I
				do if I'm not that?

						 KITTLE
				You big, fat sonofabitch, if it
				weren't for me, you'd still be
				sitting in the file room where I
				found you.
					(to Nena)
				And you... Nena... you've still got
				needle scars from where I pulled you
				out of.  You of all people...

						 NENA
				Yeah, my arms healed up real good,
				and that's how I wanna keep 'em.
				That's what I'm trying to tell you.

						 KITTLE
				Guys... all we've got is each other.
				Don't we know that by now?

	Nena stews.  Billy-Boy sweats, stares at the floor.

						 KITTLE
				Christ...
					(hurt pause)
				Alright... alright, I'm taking off.
				I'll expect you to catch up.

	He walks.  The door swings closed.  Nena's miserable.

						 NENA
					(under her breath)
				Damn him.

	INT.  PRECINCT, PARKING GARAGE -- AFTERNOON

	IN THE TORINO, Kittle gets in.  He keys the engine, pauses,
	gripping the wheel, contemplating.  It's something we've not
	seen cross Kittle's face till now: uncertainty.  Worry.

	Kittle faces front and shakes off doubt, cursing himself.
	He puts the car in gear and peels out.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOLLYWOOD STREETS -- AFTERNOON

	The Torino va-roooms past...
	    
	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle broods, turns the RADIO ON.  "Muskrat Love" by
	Captain and Tennille.  He changes channels, irritated:
	"Convoy."  "The Streak."  "Welcome Back" by John Sebastian.

						 KITTLE
					(disgusted)
				Come on, come on... !

	"The Hustle."  "Run, Joey, Run" by David Geddes.  "Kung Fu
	Fighting."  He turns the RADIO OFF, sickened.

	EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, XXX-THEATER -- AFTERNOON

	The Torino parks.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle gets a bottle of baby powder from the glove
	compartment.  He takes a section of newspaper.

	ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD

	Kittle walks briskly.  Every flea-ridden business along the
	way's drumming up business by exhibiting patriotism.  Kittle
	stops, hesitating... backtracks...

	At the XXX-THEATER, he examines a poster for "DEEP ASS,"
	which shows a half-naked, "Deep Ass" ingenue in blue eye
	shadow, pig-tails and moist lipstick.

	FLASHBACK -- THAT MORNING -- HAMBURGER STAND

	Billy-Boy Sits eating a burger, staring lovey-eyed at his
	SCHOOL-MARM girlfriend.  The girlfriend's familiar now...

	BACK TO SCENE AT XXX-THEATER

	The "school-marm" is the porn star on the poster.  Kittle
	realizes, saddened.  He KICKS -- SHATTERS the window.  The
	THEATER OWNER rushes out.

						 THEATER OWNER
				Hey, you fucking creep.

	Kittle shoves his badge in the owners face.  The owner backs
	off.  Kittle takes the "Deep Ass" poster...
	He folds it and pockets it as he continues.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- ATTERNOON

	Seedy.  DISCO MUSIC THROBS.  Kittle passes through the
	turnstile.  By the erratic light of a glitter ball, three
	topless, body-painted women, RED GO-GO DANCER, WHITE GO-GO
	DANCER and BLUE GO-GO DANCER, grind to disco rhythm.

	Kittle moves, wading thru drunken vermin.  A few BUSINESS
	MEN dance woozily in the aisle.	    

	At the bar, PINKEYE, a sizable lunatic-thug wearing a
	knitted macrame tie and brown corduroy leisure suit, watches
	Kittle cross.  Pinkeye downs his scotch.

	Kittle moves against one curtained wall, admiring the
	nearest go-go dancer.  He slips behind the curtain...

	INT.  DISCO CABARET, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	Kittle moves quickly down this hall.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET, STAIRWELL -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle climbs a long staircase.  He takes out the bottle of
	baby powder, sprinkles powder on the top landing.

	He unfolds his newspaper and places it flat over the powder.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET, OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Meet POP-SWEET, black super-pimp in lime-green fuzzy
	jump-suit and feathered fedora.

	He's on the couch, on the phone, caressing the HOOKER beside
	him.

						 POP-SWEET
					(into phone)
				Get this straight, you jive-ass
				cocksucker.  Do a number on me and
				you are between a rock and a hard
				place.  Dig it, clown?

	Pop-Sweet hangs up, grumbling as he crosses the room.

						 POP-SWEET
				Sucker thinks he can play me for a
				fool.  I'm a entrepreneur.

						 HOOKER
				You sure are, sugar.

						 POP-SWEET
				Shut up, bitch.  Don't be Ed
				McMahonning me every time I open my
				mouth.

	Pop-Sweet sits at his desk.  TWO PROSTITUTES wait there.
	One buffs his nails.  The other gives a backrub.

	The door flies open.  It's Kittle, moving forward...

						 POP-SWEET
				Ah, shit...

	Pop-Sweet reaches in a desk drawer...
	Kittle comes to SLAM the drawer on Pop-Sweet's hand.

						 POP-SWEET
				Ooooow!... alright, man, ease off...

	Kittle lets Pop-Sweet's hand free, removes the drawer and
	retrieves a pearl-handled gun, which he admires.

						 KITTLE
				You always did have style.

						 POP-SWEET
					(rubbing his wrist)
				It's one of a kind.

						 KITTLE
				So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...

	A SCREAM of RAGE is HEARD.  Kittle wheels...

	The Hooker's charging, swinging a straight razor... Kittle
	lifts the drawer to block, then PUNCHES...

	The Hooker hits shelves of vases, which crash down on her,

						 POP-SWEET
				Fuck, Kittle... why you got to go
				doin' that?!

	Pop-Sweet goes to the unconscious Hooker, rolls her away in
	favor of broken pottery, which he fingers forlornly.

						 POP-SWEET
					(of the vase)
				This shit was Ming.

						 KITTLE
				That's the problem with expensive
				tastes... the more you got, the more
				you got to lose.

	Kittle sits.  Pop-Sweet rises, studies Kittle.

						 POP-SWEET
				Where's your pet gorilla and the
				female Uncle Tom?

						 KITTLE
					(slightly off guard)
				They're... around.

						 POP-SWEET
				Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask
				today that I can't answer?  I'm a
				busy man.

						 KITTLE
				The way Zimmermann takes such good
				care of you and this drug-peddling
				"escort service" of yours, I figure
				you got the scoop on the
				pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.

						 POP-SWEET
					(deep sigh, nods)
				Well, let me tell you how it is...

	Pop-Sweet bolts, out the door,  Kittle stands, in no hurry.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET, STAIRWELL -- AFTERNOON

	Pop-Sweet runs down the hall, heading for stairs.  He hits
	the newspaper and baby powder, slipping, flying...

	TUMBLES painfully down the stairwell...
	Hits bottom and lays there, screaming.

						 POP-SWEET
				... son of a bitch... broke my
				fucking arm...

	Kittle strolls to catch up, starts downstairs.

						 POP-SWEET
				I'm gonna cut off your flippin' head
				and use it for a candy dish...

	Kittle steps on Pop-sweet's cbest, leans in close.

						 KITTLE
				Talk like that, I might forget to
				call an ambulance.  Now, tell me
				again, how's the dope arriving?

	A CREAK is HEARD behind.

						 KITTLE
					(realizes)
				Fuck...

	Just as Kittle turns, he's grabbed from behind and thrown...
	He hits a wall and lands in a heap, stunned.

							   PINKEYE
				You're the one gonna be needing an
				ambulance, white boy...

	Pinkeye's upon Kittle, stripping him of his gun.  Another
	brute, LORD CAVIAR, in an open-to-the-belly silk shirt and
	with jeweled rings on every finger, helps Pop-Sweet up.

	Kittle tries to get up.  Pinkeye PUNCHES him down.

						 POP-SWEET
					(to Pinkeye)
				Outside.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- INTERCUT...

	Red Go-Go Dancer shakes her bootie to the DISCO BEAT.

	EXT.  ALLEYWAY -- INTERCUT

	A metal door swings open as Kittle's thrown out into a pile
	of garbage.  Pinkeye, Lord Caviar and Pop-Sweet follow...

	SLO-MO: Pinkeye punches Kittle again.
	SLO-MO: Lord Caviar comes to pistol whip Kittle's head.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- INTERCUT

	White Go-Go Dancer moves her hands across her body, sexy.

	EXT.  ALLEYWAY -- INTERCUT

	SLO-MO:  Kittle's bleeding bad, tries to rise, gets KICKED.

	SLO-MO:  Pop-Sweet, clutching his arm, watches with glee.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- INTERCUT

	Blue Go-Go Dancer's breasts sway as she dances.  She smiles.

	EXT.  ALLEYWAY -- INTERCUT

	SLO-MO:  Kittle's thrown, clattering thru trash cans.
	SLO-MO:  Lord Caviar kicks Kittle's ribs.

	SLO-MO:  Kittle lifts his head, bloody, looking...

	DOWN THE ALLEY: Nena and Billy-Boy running this way!

	For a moment, Kittle smiles crooked.  He's saved.

						 KITTLE
					(weakly)
				... Nena... Billy...

	Pop-Sweet looks down the same alley...
	It's empty.  Nena and Billy-Boy were Kittle's delusion.

						 POP-SWEET
				Who you talkin' too, Kittle?

	Pop-Sweet whacks Kittle with a backhanded SLAP.

						 POP-SWEET
				They ain't there, turkey.  You're all
				by your lonesome!

	AERIAL SHOT (FROM ADJACENT ROOFTOP): looking down as the
	beating continues.   POP-SWEET'S LAUGHTER is HEARD POORLY
	DUBBED OVER and OUT OF SYNC.

	INT.  PRECINCT, VICE BULLPEN -- AFTERNOON

	Nena's miserable, wearing big headphones plugged into a
	"portable" cassette recorder, pulling files, tossing them...

	Into the box on Billy-Boy's lap.  He smokes, staring off,
	deeply depressed.  Captain Albert arrives to slap his head.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				Stop day-dreaming, lard ass.  Where's
				Kittle?

	Nena takes off her headset.

						 NENA
				He went to pick up lunch.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				Well, shake a leg.  Get these files
				downstairs...
					(to Nena)
				And, quit listening to your fucking
				voodoo music.

						 NENA
					(sarcastic, salutes)
				Yes, sir.

	As the captain moves on, Nena makes her salute into the
	finger.  She and Billy-Boy share a long look of mutual
	frustration, then Billy-Boy shuffles away.

	Nena puts headphones back on, ejects a tape from her
	recorder and replaces it with another.

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- INTERCUT...

	Captain Albert sits.  PHONE RINGS.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(into phone)
				Yeah, what is it?

						 ZIMMERMANN (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				Is your telephone etiquette always so
				sloppy?

	Captain Albert tenses, goes to shut his door.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(nervous, into phone)
				Why the hell are you calling me here?

	EXT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION -- ESTABLISHING -- INTERCUT

	Beyond a gate topped by an ornate "Z," a pseudo-modern,
	stucco-nightmare palace sits in H'wood hills.

						 ZIMMERMANN (v.o.)
				Calmly, captain.  If it weren't
				important, I wouldn't disturb the
				fine work you do...

	INT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, GREAT ROOM -- INTERCUT

	Party preparations.  Men chisel a bald eagle ice sculpture.
	Thugs lounge on Ethan Allen furnishings.  Zimmermann stands
	with the phone held to his ear by his ENGLISH BUTLER.

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(into phone)
				Your children played with their guns
				in front of me again today.  This
				upsets me.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				They've been suspended.  Hell, the
				do-gooder district attorney came and
				did it himself.  Thinks he's being a
				patriot.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Suspending those three is about as
				useful as giving a speeding ticket to
				Evil Knievel.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT (v.o.)
				I'm keeping an eye on them.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				No.  I've had my fill.  I want them
				taken out of the game.
					    (waiting)
				Hello?!  Still on the line?

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT (v.o.)
				Yeah... I hear...

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- INTERCUT

	Captain Albert wipes his sweaty brow.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(into phone)
				What you're asking... goes against
				every code of honor...

						 ZIMMERMANN (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				Isn't it a bit late to regret lost
				innocence?  We don't want any
				indiscreet photographs ending up in
				the hands of your wife, do we?

	Captain Albert agonizes, reddening, trapped.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(pause, into phone)
				I can... make certain arrangements.
				But, it'll cost extra.

	INT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, GREAT ROOM -- INTERCUT

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(into phone)
				Name your price.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				I want those pictures.  The

				Pluck this thorn from my paw, and
				you'll have them, with my gratitude.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT (v.o.)
					(bitterly)
				Just the pictures'll be fine, you
				dirty bastard.

	Zimmermann exits, motioning for the butler to hang up.
	Behind, workmen on ladders unfurl a gigantic American flag
	from ceiling to floor.  Breathtaking.

	INT,  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, FOYER -- AFTERNOON

	A meek music instructor, VINCHENZO, waits with sheet music
	under his arm, studying a painting.  Zimmermann strides in,
	his mood brightening,

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Vinchenzo... forgive me for letting
				business trifles distract my
				attention.  On to more important
				pursuits, eh?  Come, come... I have a
				surprise...

	Zimmermann ushers the always nervous Vinchenzo forward.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, MUSIC ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Zimmermann's hands open a medium-sized wooden packing crate.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				It arrived today.  You won't believe
				it, even when you see...

	They're in a room that's like a bad family-theme-restaurant
	version of a 18th century European music parlor.  Gaudy.
	Big harp in a corner.  Zimmermann digs thru shredded paper
	in the crate, removing an old violin case.

	Vinchenzo is taken aback as Zimmermann opens the case, and
	gently takes out a beautiful VIOLIN.

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(with reverence)
				Stradivarius.  Antonius Stradivarius
				of Cremona, post seventeen hundred.
				One of perhaps five hundred and
				forty.  Absolutely priceless.
				    (studies it)
				I was born in Newark, New Jersey,
				Vinchenzo, as far away from this
				moment as I think you could ever get.
				My family lived each day in poverty.
				I wasn't expected to make anything of
				myself.  Failure was a given.

						 VINCHENZO
				May I...

	Zimmermann lets Vinchenzo hold the violin,

						 ZIMMERMANN
				These hands...
					(holds his hands up)
				These are the hands of a grocery
				clerk... of a janitor, and then a
				numbers runner who fought and clawed
				and battled, by hook or by crook, to
				get his piece of the American dream.
				These hands were not destined to
				caress a Stradivarius,  And yet...
					(takes violin back)
				The impossible.

	Zimmermann picks up his bow off a music stand.  Vinchenzo
	takes this as his cue, moving obediently to place music on
	the stand in front of Zimmermann.

	With a flourish, Zimmermann puts the Stradivarius under his
	chin, tilts his head, puts the how to the violin strings.  A
	pause, and then...

	Zlmmermann proceeds to play horribly.  Screechy and
	uneven.  He tries to follow the sheet music, but a child
	could do better.

	Vinchenzo attempts to guide by motioning with his hands and
	body language, cringing a bit, trying to encourage.

	Zimmermann's frustrated, but keeps playing, vomitously bad,
	biting his tongue in concentration.

				Where we going?

				We have to find Kittle.

	Nena ducks behind a squad car.  She gets in and yanks wires
	under the dash, hot wiring.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Okay.  But, what changed our mind?

						 NENA
					(sparking wires)
				Just keep an eye out till I get this

	Billy-Boy rises to keep watch.  His eyes narrow...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Wait a minute... he's back...

	Across the garage, Kittle's Torino is moving thru.

	Billy-Boy and Nena move to follow.

	The Torino parks... the door opens...

	Kittle gets out, beaten bloody, barely supporting himself.

	INT.  PRECINCT, BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle's lying on the floor in Nena's lap, swollen-faced and
	bruised.  Nena uses a needle to sew inside his mouth.

				It's nohody's fault but mine.  I got
				blindsided.

	Billy-Boy's pacing, frustrated, sad, infuriated.

						 BILLY-BOY
				We shoulda been there to back you up.
				We shoulda!

						 KITTLE
				Stop blaming yourself.

	Nena makes a stitch.  Kittle's lip is pulled by the thread.

						 NENA
				You need a doctor.

						 KITTLE
				Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.
					(drinks from flask)
				And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're

	Billy-Boy SMASHES a mirror with his fist.

				I'll kill 'em...

	Looking to vent, he grips a sink, jerking it furiously,
	starting to pull it from the wall, water spurting...

				Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!

				Fuck, man... I was only kidding... !

						 LOCK-UP GUARD

	Uniformed cops pass.  Captain Albert rises from behind a

	At the Torino, he takes out the paper bag, unwraps a small,
	plastic-explosive CAR BOMB and hand-held DETONATOR.

	UNDER THE TORINO, Captain Albert crawls to the gas tank.  He
	attaches the car bomb with a magnetic THUNK.

				This is the police lock-up.  We're
				police.  How can we steal from
				ourselves?

						 BILLY-BOY
				Then, why'd we tie him up?

						 KITTLE
				We're stealing, okay!  Quit yackin'
				and do it faster.

	Kittle flips open a box.  His eyes brighten with excitement.

						 KITTLE
				Ay Dios mio...

	It's a box of DYNAMITE.  Kittle caresses it.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRECINCT, UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- AFTERNOON

	Weapons are piled into the Torino's trunk.  The trunk is
	slammed shut.  Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy look to make sure
	no one's taken undue notice.

						 KITTLE
				So far so good.  We're past the point
				of no return.

	Kittle looks for support, holds out his hand.   Nena grips
	his hand... Billy-Boy joins in; like teammates clasping
	hands in a football huddle, gathering courage.

						 KITTLE
				Let's get this thing done.

						 NENA
				All for one...

						 BILLY-BOY
				... and fuck 'em all.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Captain Albert stands looking out the window, nervous.

						 KITTLE (o.s.)
				Must be your lucky day, cap'n...

	The captain turns.  Kittle enters with a shoebox.

						 KITTLE
				I'm gonna put a great big,
				ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your
				face.  How 'bout that?

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				Where have you been?

						 KITTLE
				I'm here.  That's all that counts.
				Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's
				like magic...

	Kittle puts the box on the desk, takes the lid off, takes
	three badges from his pocket... puts them in.  Takes out
	his revolver, drops it in, followed by two more guns.

						 KITTLE
				It's our gift to you.  Something
				you've always wanted...

	Kittle puts the lid on, adorns it with a tattered gift bow.

						 KITTLE
				Our resignations.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				You going rogue on me?

						 KITTLE
				Maybe.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				What happened, Kittle?  We used to be
				friends.  You used to know how the
				game was played.

						 KITTLE
				You mean taking bribes, and skimming
				busts and letting hoods walk? You
				mean not being able to sleep at night
				after shaking down some honest Joe?

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				There was a time when you did things
				the right way, till you hooked up
				with that fat-assed-boozehound and
				the soul-sister.

	Kittle just shrugs... walks.  But, he stops in the doorway.

						 KITTLE
				Oh, there's one more thing...
					(walks back)
				Now, where did I put that... ?
					(searching pockets)
				Uh... oh, here it is...

	Kittle takes his fist from his pocket and holds it up,
	admiring it a moment, smiling, then SUCKER PUNCHING...

	The captain's knocked to the floor, nose bloodied.

						 KITTLE
				Screw you.

	INT.  PRECINCT, VICE BULLPEN -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle crosses to leave.  Captain Albert comes to shout.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				You're washed up, Kittle!  You're all
				done!

	Cops stare.  Captain Albert tries to control his temper.

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Captain Albert closes and locks the door.  He goes to the
	window, takes out the detonator.

	He flicks the switch.  GREEN BULB on the detonator LIGHTS.

	INT.  PRECINCT, UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle joins Nena and Billy-Boy in the Torino.  Peel out...

	EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	The Torino bursts into sunlight, hits pavement...

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Captain Albert looks to the street three stories below,
	gripping the detonator, angry breath fogging the window.

	THRU THE WINDOW: the Torino's moving away.

	Captain Albert holds up the detonator.
	His thumb caresses the button.
	    
						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
				Good riddance.

	His thumb tenses.

	THRU THE WINDOW: the Torino spins, turning...

	EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	The Torino u-turns, coming to a halt facing the precinct.

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Captain Albert lowers the detonator, watching, curious.

	THRU THE WINDOW: Nena can be seen getting out, carrying
	something to a phone booth close by.  She dials the phone.

	PHONE RINGS O.S.  Captain Albert looks to the phone on his
	desk,  He answers it, brings it to the window.

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(into phone)
				What... ?

						 NENA (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				How you doing up there in your ivory
				tower, Captain?

	EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	In the phone booth, Nena waves up to the captain's window,
	Kittle and Billy-Boy are looking up from in the car.

						 NENA
					(into phone)
				I'm gonna let you in on a secret.
				See, that wasn't my "voodoo music" I
				was listening to before.

	Nena lifts her tape recorder, HITS PLAY.

						 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (v.o.)
					(from recorder)
				... are you calling me here?

						 ZIMMERMANN (v.o.)
					(from recorder)
				Calmly Captain.  If it weren't
				important..

	INT.  PRECINCT, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Captain Albert's face goes slack.

						 ZIMMERMANN'S VOICE (v.o.)
					(from over phone)
				... I wouldn't disturb the fine work
				you do.  Your children played with
				their guns in front of me...

	Captain Albert unscrews his mouthpiece... something falls...

	Rolls on the floor, stops: a micro-transmitter.

	Captain Albert trembles, holds up the detonator...

						 CAPTAIN ALBERT
					(into phone)
				Burn in hell, whore!

	He pushes the button...

	THRU THE WINDOW: nothing happens to the Torino.  A quiet
	BEEPING is HEARD 0.S.... BEEP... BEEP...

	A moment of confusion for Captain Albert, then he turns...

	The BEEPING comes from the SHOEBOX Kittle left on the desk.
	Stark terror.  Captain Albert leaps to grab the box...

	He tears off the lid.  The bomb is there, under guns and
	badges.  He grabs it, throws it...

	The bomb spins, heading for the window...

	A brief look of relief on Captain Albert's face...

	As the bomb hits the window... but, bounces off...
	Falls to the floor.

	Captain Albert's expression returns to terror.

	EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	From Nena, Kittle and Billy-Boy's vantage point: the
	EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT the captain's window!

	Cops look up, alarmed, shouting and pointing.
	They run as shards of glass fall to the sidewalk.

	Nena returns to the Torino.  Kittle revs and speeds
	away.

									    CUT TO:

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- AFTERNOON

	DISCO MUSIC.  Mock sex on stage.  Pop-Sweet, arm in a cast,
	is behind the bar with Pinkeye, counting cash.

	Pop-Sweet enters cash figures in a large, bound ACCOUNTANT'S
	LEDGER book full of columns of handwritten numbers.

	At the club entrance, Lord Caviar's playing bouncer.
	Kittle enters, breezing past with a shotgun.  Lord Caviar
	does a double take, can't believe it, follows...

	Behind, Billy-Boy and Nena enter, following Lord Caviar...

	Lord Caviar reaches in his jacket for his gun, closing in on
	Kittie.  Billy-Boy SWINGS a golf club -- THWACKS Lord Caviar
	in the back of the head.

	Lord Caviar falls face first to the floor.  Kittle doesn't
	even look back, cocks his shotgun, aims...	    -

	In the BOOTH, the D.J. jumps for cover as buckshot SHATTERS
	glass and record albums.  FEEDBACK SCREECHES.

	Behind the bar, Pop-Sweet and Pinkeye react.

	Billy-Boy and Nena head for the bar, passing Kittle as
	Kittle retargets his shotgun upwards and FIRES...

	The disco GLITTER BALL EXPLODES!

	Customers, waitresses and strippers scatter.  Pop-Sweet and
	Pinkeye take out weapons...

	Billy-Boy holds his golf club by its shaft between his
	teeth, leveling two handguns, and Nena's already FIRING...

	Bullets hit the bar, BUSTING BOTTLES and MIRRORS.  Pop-Sweet
	and Pinkeye are forced to duck down.

	Billy-Boy and Nena keep BLASTING, still moving forward.

	Kittle drops his shotgun, produces two revolvers and moves
	to the bar, adding to the gunfire barrage -- BLAM, BLAM,
	BLAM -- between Nena and Billy-Boy, who stop to reload,

	Behind the bar, Pop-Sweet and Pinkeye go fetal, covered in
	broken glass and debris.

	Kittle stops firing.  Nena and Billy-Boy come to flank him,
	pointing reloaded weapons.

						 NENA
				Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see
				empty hands!

						 KITTLE
				Out here.  On your knees.

	Hands rise, then Pop-Sweet and Pinkeye show their faces.
	They move from behind the bar, seething.

						 POP-SWEET
				You can't do this to me!  Who the
				fuck do you think you are!?

	Kittle takes the driver from Billy-Boy's teeth, swings it.

						 KITTLE
				Who am I, you say?
					(hefting club,
					 moving forward)
				I am one angry, angry man...

						 LORD CAVIAR (o.s.)
				Freeze, piggies!

	Behind, Lord Caviar points a gun, clutching his bloody head.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I knew I shoulda used a 9-iron.

						 LORD CAVIAR
				Lose the guns or I'll smoke you!

	Our heroes drop their many weapons, raising their hands.

						 POP-SWEET
				Looks like you got it all
				backasswards again, Kittle...

	Pinkeye moves towards the cops.  Lord Caviar edges in from
	the other side.  No way out for our heroes.

	Nena moves her fingertips along her coat sleeve seam...
	readies a six-pointed sherikan (Oriental throwing star).

	Nena glances to Billy-Boy... Billy-Boy glances to Kittle...
	Kittle glances to Nena...

	At the bar, Pop-Sweet lifts a broken, jagged bottle...

						 POP-SWEET
				You thought you got hurt last time...
				you ain't seen nothing yet.

	Pinkeye bends to retrieve a gun off the floor.  Kittle
	spins, SMASHES his foot down on Pinkeye's hand!

	Nena spins, throwing the sharp-edged star at Lord Caviar...

	The throwing star SLICES Lord Caviar's face.  He recoils,
	crying out and misfiring his gum.

	Kittle kicks Pinkeye in the head, then turns...

						 KITTLE
				Billy... !

	Kittle kicks the golf club off the floor...

	The golf club spins in the air...

	Billy-Boy catches the club, SWINGS without missing a beat,..

	Lord Caviar's recovered and aiming his gun just as Billy-Boy
	SWINGS the club -- KNOCKS the gun across the room.

					  POP-SWEET
				No!!

	Pop-Sweet moves forward with the bottle, but Nena steps up,
	poised kung-fu ready.  Pop-Sweet hesitates, circling.

	Across the room, Lord Caviar rushes forwards and tackles
	Billy-Boy, toppling tables.  They battle.

	Pinkeye's rising, but Kittle PUNCHES.

	Pop-Sweet stabs the jagged bottle at Nena.  Nena high-kicks,
	disarming Pop-Sweet, then spins flawlessly... KICKS
	Pop-Sweet's chin, sending him backwards.

	Billy-Boy kicks Lord Caviar off...
	Lord Caviar gets up, charges headlong at Billy-Boy.
	Billy-Boy raises his club, side-stepping...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Fore!

	Billy-B swings -- CLUNK -- sends Lord Caviar onward...
	Lord Caviar CRASHES head-first into a cigarette machine.

	Pop-Sweet scrambles up, throwing a chair at Nena, which she
	dodges.  Pop-Sweet flees...

	Kittle KNEES Pinkeye's head... sees Pop-Sweet running.

						 NENA
				Go!  I'll finish this.

	Kittle runs after Pop-Sweet.

	Pop-Sweet bursts out a side door, heading for daylight.
	Kittle pursues, sprinting.  Billy-B follows.

	INT.  DISCO CABARET -- AFTERNOON

	Nena watches Pinkeye and Lord Caviar get up.  She preps,
	feet apart, doing martial arts warm-ups as they approach.

						 LORD CAVIAR
				Are you that good, sister?  Think you
				can handle us both?

	Lord Caviar grins, moves in.  Pinkeye attacks...

	Nena blocks, PUNCHES, CHOPS, SPINS and SLAPS, then finishes
	with a GROIN KICK.  Pinkeye hits the dirt.

	Lord Caviar strikes.  Nena FLIPS HIM...
	BOOM -- Lord Caviar lands flat, lays there gasping.

						 NENA
				They don't call it a black belt for
				nothing.

	At the bar, Nena comes to claim the money ledger, tilting it
	to clear off the shattered glass it's buried under.

	Busy sidewalks.  Pop-Sweet runs, fearful.  Kittle chases.
	Billy-Boy brings up the rear.

	Pop-Sweet PUSHES pedestrians...

						 POP-SWEET
				Outta the way!  Move!

	AROUND A CORNER

	Pop-Sweet arrives, full speed, looking back... SLAMS a "MAPS
	TO STARS HOMES" sign and TRASH CAN, upsetting them and
	knocking a map-hawking kid out of his lawn chair...

	Pop-Sweet rolls in star-maps and garbage.  Gets up...

	Keeps running.

	Kittle leaps the trash can.

	A moment, then Billy-Boy arrives, leaps...
	Trips over the trash can, falls hard.  Scrambles up.

	AHEAD, Pop-Sweet shoves an OLD WOMAN to the ground.

	People gather to help the Old Woman up.  She's thanking them
	as Kittle comes barreling thru... knocking her down again.

	AT AN INTERSECTION

	Pop-Sweet runs across, catty-corner.  Cars swerve and brake,
	CRASHING all around,..

	Pop-Sweet gets HIT, rolls across a car's hood...
	CRACKS the windshield and rolls off...

	Pop-Sweet recovers, dazed, stumbling to sidewalk...

	Kittle's bearing down, makes a diving tackle...

	INT.  ANTIQUE SHOP -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle and Pop-Sweet SMASH thru the front window.

	The SHOP OWNER and a WEALTHY LADY react, terrified.

						 SHOP OWNER
				Oh my Lord, no!!

	Kittle and Pop-Sweet wrestle, punching and grappling,
	surrounded on all sides by antiquities and shelves loaded
	with precious knick-knacks.

						 SHOP OWNER
				No, no, no!  Stop this!

	Pop-Sweet swings his arm cast -- KNOCKS Kittle back...

	Kittle lands against shelves...
	Fragile items teeter on the brink, miraculously not falling.

	Pop-Sweet runs up a nearby STAIRCASE.

	Kittle leaps to follow.

	The shop owner goes to steady the shelves.  Behind, THRU THE
	BROKEN WINDOW: we can see Billy-Boy rumbling this direction.

						 SHOP OWNER
					(sigh of relief)
				Thank God.

	The shop owner takes a step back.  Billy-Boy jumps thru the
	broken window...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Make way!

	BUMPS the shop owner, heading for stairs...
	The shop owner's knocked forward, SLAMMING shelves.  Dishes
	and trinkets SHATTER.  Shelves COLLAPSE like dominoes.

	AERIAL LONG SHOT (VIA ADJACENT ROOFTOPS): Pop-Sweet flees

	Above, Kittle arrives, sees Pop-Sweet go thru that door.

	Pop-Sweet hurries downstairs, into a hall.

	INT.  MOVIE THEATER -- FOOTCHASE CONTINUES

	Pop-Sweet comes through a door at the back of the theater,
	gasping, squinting in the dark.

	The theater's pretty crowded.  On the screen, Linda Blair
	curses and vomits im "The Exorcist."  Pop-Sweet heads down
	the center aisle, looks back...

	Kittle enters from the same door.  He spots Pop-Sweet.
	Kittle chases.  Pop-Sweet picks up the pace, yelling...

						 POP-SWEET
				Fire!  Fire!!

	Pop-Sweet runs to an exit as panic begins.  PEOPLE SCREAM
	and pour into the aisle.  Kittle curses...

						 KITTLE
					(incensed, to himself)    -
				Fucking first amendment violation...

	Kittle's caught in the rush of patrons, like trying to swim
	upstream.  It's useless.

	Pop-Sweet pushes out the exit, followed by theater-goers.
	He runs down an alleyway.

	EXT.  THEATER, FRONT -- FOOTCHASE CONTINUES

	Kittle's in the mob exiting below the marquee.  He pushes
	through, heading down the block.

	Billy-Boy comes out... follows Kittle.

	EXT.  ALLEYWAY -- FOOTCHASE CONTINUES

	Pop-Sweet enters this deserted alley, exhausted.  He looks
	around, has an idea... climbs into a TRASH DUMPSTER, closes
	the lid.  After a moment, Kittle arrives, running past...

	Billy-Boy arrives, watches Kittle disappear around the next
	corner.  Billy-Boy follows, red faced... stops,
	doubled-over, breathless.

	Giving up, Billy-Boy goes to sit on the ground, beside the
	dumpsters, takes out his cigarettes.  A moment, then, mere
	inches above Billy-Boy's head, one dumpster lid raises and
	Pop-Sweet peers out.

	Pop-Sweet looks around, with Billy-Boy just below his sight
	line, satisfied the coast is clear.  Pop-Sweet throws the
	lid open and starts to climb out.  Billy-Boy looks up...
	Pop-Sweet looks down -- they both cry out in surprise.

	Billy-Boy jumps, grabbing, but Pop-Sweet clamors atop
	another dumpster, looks up...

	There's a long LADDER up the side of the building.  It's
	within reach.  Pop-Sweet starts climbing.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Kittle!

	Billy-Boy awkwardly climbs the dumpster.

	EXT.  PARKING LOT -- FOOTCHASE CONTINUES

	Kittle runs out from the alley, searching.

	Kittle arrives, confused... looks up...
	Pop-Sweet's high on the ladder, hampered by his broken arm.
	Billy-Boy climbs after.  Four stories up.

						 KITTLE
				Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!

						 BILLY-BOY
				I got him.

	Billy-Boy grabs at Pop-Sweet's ankles.  Pop-Sweet kicks.

						 KITTLE
				Don't you let him fall!  You hear me?

	Billy-Boy grabs Pop-Sweet again, hanging on to his pants
	leg.  Pop-Sweet hooks his cast around a rung, swinging with
	his good hand, beating on Billy.

	Pop-Sweet's cast arm slips...

						 KITTLE
				Don't drop him!  We need him...

	Pop-Sweet falls... screaming...

	Kittle watches him drop.  The SICKENING THUD is HEARD O.S.

						 KITTLE
				... alive.

	Kittle lets out a sigh, looks admonishingly up at Billy-Boy.

	Billy-Boy looks down, ashamed, embarrassed, at a loss.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, REAR PORTICO -- AFTERNOON

	Facing a vast view of the cityscape, Zimmermann's alone,
	continuing to play his Stradivarius violin.  He's as awful
	as before, but the difference is his patience is less.

	His level of frustration has brought him near tears as he
	tries over and over to play a section of music that just
	refuses to come out anything other than jarring squeaks.

	Finally, Zimmermann grips the Stradivarius by the neck and
	SMASHES it against the porch wall, again and again, till all
	that's left of it are very expensive toothpicks.

	Zimmermann catches his breath, in a terrible state,
	regretting.  Expecting to feel better, he feels much worse.

						 BALLS (o.s.)
				Excuse me... Mister Zinmermann...

	Zimmermann wheels to see Balls and Poe arrive.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				What is it?

	Balls walks over, begins whispering in Zimmermann's ear.
	Balls finishes, steps back.  Zimmermann ponders, then
	crosses on his way back into the mansion.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Kill them, Poe.  Find them, and make

	He looks down, touching the folded poster, remembering...

				Alright... how about you two hit the

				heart.

	Kittle finds a pad of paper.

						 "SCHOOL-MARM"
				Let me tell him.  Let him decide.

						 KITTLE
				You're not gonna see him again.

						 "SCHOOL-MARM"
				What... what makes you think you can
				order me around?!

						 KITTLE
				Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
				You're probably the first girl
				Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with,
				and I know for sure you're the first
				he's slept with.  So, how's he
				gonna feel...
					(holds up poster)
				... when he finds out that the only
				first he is for you is the first guy
				who didn't have to pull out at the
				last second to get his close-up?

	The "school-marm" wipes tears, miserable.

						 KITTLE
				Hasn't he got enough problems, or
				didn't you notice that's not cream
				soda on his breath?

						 "SCHOOL-MARM"
				... okay... you made your point.

	Kittle lays the pad of paper on the table, places a
	ball-point pen on the pad, pulls out a chair...

						 KITTLE
				Sit.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	The Torino pulls up the drive of Billy-Boy's tiny house.

	DOWN THE STREET, in a parked Cadillac, Zimmermann's henchman
	Mickey takes notice.  He lifts the microphone of a CB RADIO.

	BEHIND THE HOUSE, Kittle parks.

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle jimmies the back door and enters.  He looks around,
	opens a drawer... digs up a garbage bag.

	IN THE BEDROOM, Kittle goes to sort thru the closet.  He
	pulls dresses and skirts, stuffing them in the garbage bag.

	He removes a bra from the back of a chair.

	IN THE BATHROOM,  Kittle opens the medicine cabinet, finds
	lipstick, make-up and tampons.  Puts them in the bag.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, REAR -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle comes out the back.  At trash cans, he shoves the
	garbage bag deep, buries it.

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle returns to place an envelope on a coffee table.
	VOICES are HEARD OUTSIDE... a KEY IN THE LOCK.  Kittle
	hurries out just as Nena and Billy-Boy enter.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, REAR -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle slips out the back.  FOLLOW as he moves along the
	side of the house, keeping low, to the front.

	Down the street, in the Cadillac, Mickey watches, confused.

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Billy-Boy goes to refill his flask near shelves which hold a
	PITTSBURGH STEELERS SHRINE: Super Bowl IX pennant,
	autographed Terry Bradshaw photo and other memorabilia.
	Billy-Boy crosses himself at the shrine, making sure Nena
	doesn't notice.  Nena's looking around.

						 NENA
				You live like a pig.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Can't you say something nice once?

						 NENA
				Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in
				here as I remember it smelling.

	Kittle comes in the front door.

						 KITTLE
				Been waiting long?

						 NENA
				Just got here.

						 KITTLE
				How'd we do?

						 NENA
				A.D. is a C.P.A.

						 KITTLE
				Come again... ?

						 NENA
				Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public
				Accountant.  But, that's all we got.

						 KITTLE
				Maybe it's enough.

	Kittle finds a yellow pages PHONE BOOK in a pile of
	magazines, goes to open it on the coffee table, paging thru.

						 BILLY-BOY
				No offices are gonna be open today.

						 KITTLE
					(searching phone book)
				Lots of these pencil-pushers work out
				of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.

						 NENA
				Bad news is, word's spreading like
				wildfire that we don't have badges,
				and nobody wants to end up getting
				splattered like Butch Cassidy either.

						 BILLY-BOY
				If we don't catch a break soon, we're
				gonna be left standing with our dicks
				in our hands.

						 NENA
				Speak for yourself.

	Billy-Boy notices the envelope Kittle left on the table.  He
	picks it up, curious... unfolds the letter inside.

						 KITTLE
					(searching yellow pages)
				Bingo.  Got him...
					(TEARS PAGE OUT)
				Let's pay Archibald a visit.

	Kittle stands, then notices Billy-Boy reading the letter.

						 KITTLE
				What do you got there, Billy?

	Billy-Boy keeps reading, disbelieving, filled with sadness.
	He lowers the letter, staring off.

						 BILLY-BOY
				She... she's gone...

						 KITILE
					(takes letter, reading)
				Dear Billy... been thinking about
				us... decided you're too good for me.
				I don't deserve you...
					(jumps ahead)
				Don't try to find me...
					(to Billy-Boy)
				Sorry, kid.  That's a tough break.

	Billy-Boy looks zombie-like, reaches to take the letter,
	studies it.  He rips it up.  Pause... then, Billy-Boy lifts
	the coffee table and chucks it across the room.

	Kittle and Nena back off.

	Billy-Boy goes berserk, wrecking the place.  He flips the
	couch, pulls down shelves, knocks pictures off walls.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	Another Cadillac arrives with Balls and THUG-ONE.  Mickey
	gets out of his Caddie, preps a machine gun.  Poe pulls up
	in his souped-up MUSTANG with THUG-TWO as a passenger.

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle and Nena watch Billy-B destroy his television.

						 KITTLE
				He's taking this better than I
				thought he would.

	Billy-Boy swats a lamp, kicks furniture, stumbles, looks
	around, breathing heavily.  Pause... then, he sits, bursting
	into tears.  Nena moves to comfort him.

						 NENA
				Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.

						 BILLY-BOY
				... where... where's a jerk like me
				ever gonna find another girl to love
				him... huh?...

	Billy-Boy sobs, truly heartbroken.  Nena hugs him.

						 NENA
				Don't talk like that.  There's plenty
				of women around for jerks like you.

						 BILLY-BOY
				You're lying...

	Kittle's sad, unsure.  He pets Billy-Boy's shoulder.

						 KITTLE
				You're a good guy, Billy.  These
				things happen...

	Billy-Boy hugs Nena.  She holds him, really feels for him.
	Kittle notices something strange... crosses...

	At the window, Kittle pulls the curtain: sees Poe and four
	other villains heading across the lawn with lots of guns.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	Poe spots Kittle at the window.

						 POE
				Now!

	Villains OPEN FIRE...

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle turns and leaps onto Nena and Billy-Boy, bowling them
	over in mid-hug as the FRONT WINDOW IS BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.

	DOZENS of BULLETS and SHOTGUN BLASTS pepper the walls.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	Poe and the others move in, all SHOOTING...

	INT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

	Billy-Boy crawls, wiping tears, terrified.  Nena and Kittle
	follow.  Glass, plaster and splinters of wood shower down.

	Billy-Boy looks back...
	Sees his STEELERS SHRINE BLASTED to PIECES

						 BILLY-BOY
				Motherfuckers!

	IN THE KITCHEN, Billy-Boy, Kittle and Nena sprawl through
	the doorway.  BULLETS RICOCHET.  Cupboards are blown open.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, REAR -- AFTERNOON

	Billy-Boy, Nena and Kittle tumble out the back door.
	They scramble towards the Torino.

	EXT.  BILLY-BOY'S HOUSE, FRONT -- AFTERNOON

	Villains keep up the assault.  The Torino appears from
	around the side of the house, ZOOMING down the drive...

	Villains redirect their fire.  The Torino hits the street...

	Heading away.  Poe shouts orders as he and his fellow
	assassins run to their vehicles.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  URBAN STRAIGHTAWAY -- AFTERNOON

	Here comes the Torino, full out....
	BEHIND: two Cadillacs followed by the Mustang.

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy's loading a pump shotgun, muttering angrily...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Destroy a man's Steelers shrine.
				That's a declaration of war!

	Billy-Boy turns to peer out back.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Okay, we got... one, two... three...
					(up to Kittle)
				Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.

						 KITTLE
				Could be worse.  I don't know how,
				but I'm sure it could.

	Nena sits backwards in her seat, on her knees, fastens her
	seatbelt.  She leans out her window, FIRING...

	ON THE STREET

	Mickey shifts lanes as his windshield sprouts BULLET HOLES.

	Poe's Mustang pulls ahead of the Cadillacs.  Thug-Two leans
	out the passenger window and FIRES a MACHINE GUN...

	BULLETS STRIKE the Torino's ass.  REAR WINDOW SHATTERS.

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle hunkers down.  Nena reloads.  Billy-Boy's horizontal.

						 NENA
					(to Billy-Boy)
				You plan on shooting that gun or just
				hugging it?

						 BILLY-BOY
				I'm waiting till the time's right.

						 KITTLE
				Well, sometime before we're all dead
				would be nice, if it's not too much
				fucking trouble, yellow-belly!

	ON THE STREET

	In the Mustang, Thug-Two withdrawals to reload.
	Billy-Boy pops up in the Torino's rear window, BLASTING...
	The Mustang's right HEADLIGHT FRAGMENTS.

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy PUMPS the shotgun, targeting...

						 BILLY-BOY
				He's too far back.

	Kittle looks in the rearview, hits brakes...

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino slows, bringing the Mustang closer...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Thank you...

	Billy-Boy FIRES...
	Poe and Thug-Two duck as their HOOD is BLOWN CLEAN OFF...

	IN THE TORINO

						 BILLY-BOY
				Yoo-hoo!  Flipped his lid!

	ON THE STREET

	The hood spins in the air... bounces off Balls' Cadillac.

	IN THE MUSTANG

	Poe curses, downshifting, exposed ENGINE WHINING...

	ON THE STREET

	The Mustang falls back.  Mickey's Cadillac comes to the
	Torino's driver side... BASHING... SLAMMING...

	Billy-Boy FIRES out the side window...

	CRACKS Mickey's windshield, but Mickey keeps RAMMING.

	FURTHER DOWN THE STREET

	The chase roars past.
	IN THE OPPOSITE LANE, a police squad car passes...

	IN THE SQUAD CAR

	Officers Steve and Jim crane their necks, looking back.

						 OFFICER STEVE
				You see that?

						 OFFICER JIM
				Sure as shit I did.

	Officer Jim spins the wheel...

	ON THE STREET

	The squad car jumps the divider, u-turning.

	AHEAD, DOWN THE STREET

	The Torino and Mickey's Cadillac keep slamming.
	They separate to get around a slow truck, then...

	SLAM back together.
	BEHIND: GUNFIRE from Balls' Caddie...

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle flinches as a BULLET DESTROYS his REARVIEW MIRROR.

						 KITTLE
				This is completely, Goddamn
				unacceptable!

	ON THE STREET

	Kittle accelerates as Billy-B and Nena return fire.  The
	Torino moves left, cutting in front of Mickey's Cadillac...

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle looks to Nena, who's reloading again.

						 KITTLE
				Get his attention.

						 NENA
					(raises and cocks guns)
				Your wish is my command.

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino brakes, keeping left, which brings Mickey's
	Cadillac along Nena's side as Nena OPENS FIRE...

	Mickey ducks as his WINDOW IMPLODES...

	Kittle jams the steering wheel right...
	FORCING Mickey's Cadillac over, toward sidewalk...

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
					(thru clenched teeth)
				This one's for McDoogle's kid!!

	ON THE STREET

	Mickey's Cadillac COLLIDES with parked cars -- lifting
	impossibly, airborne, spinning sideways.

	CRASHING an abandoned STOREFRONT as citizens flee!

	IN THE TORINO

						 NENA
					(looking back)
				Bye-bye bad guy!

	ON THE STREET

	Back at the storefront, Mickey's Cadillac BURSTS INTO FLAME!
	Debris flies.  And then, as one might expect, Mickey leaps
	out from fire, BURNING FROM HEAD TO TOE, running in circles,
	flapping his arms!

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- CHASE CONTINUES

	AT THE MOUTH OF A TUNNEL, the Torino soars out, heading
	downhill to mid-city streets.

	The Mustang and Balls' Cadillac follow...
	The squad car tails, still in the running.

	IN THE TORINO

	A SIREN is HEARD behind.  Kittle glances back, happy...

						 KITTLE
				Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in
				this thing after all.

						 NENA
					(lifts sunglasses,
					 squints back)
				Who is that... ?

	ON THE STREET

	In Balls' Cadillac, Thug-One SHOOTS at the squad car as it
	passes.  Officer Steve returns fire.

	Then, the squad car overtakes Poe's Mustang.  Officer Steve
	SHOOTS at Poe.  The Mustang swerves away.

	IN THE TORINO

						 BILLY-BOY
				Far out, man!  Get those bastards!

	Billy-Boy gives a thumbs-up, smiling...

	IN THE SQUAD CAR

						 OFFICER STEVE
				Fucking hot-dogging vice pricks.
				Let's see how hot you are now... !

	Officer Steve levels his pistol at the Torino...

	IN THE TORINO

	The smile is wiped off Biliy-Boy's face as Officer Steve
	FIRES at him repeatedly.  Our heroes duck and cringe...

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino takes a sharp turn, gaining breathing room.

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				What the hell's his problem?

						 NENA
				You mean, besides the warrant out on
				us for blowing up our commanding
				officer?

	Billy-Boy rise's with his "Steelers" helmet on, peers back,
	recognizing the officers behind...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Remember those two uniform cops who
				been giving us such a hard time... ?

						 KITTLE
				Yeah.

						 BILLY-BOY
				The ones you got in that fist-fight
				with a couple a weeks ago... ?

						 KITTLE
				Yeah.

						 BILLY-BOY
				That's them trying to kill us.

						 KITTLE
				Well, they sure know how to hold a
				grudge.

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino makes another shrill turn...
	Past a "WRONG WAY" sign, up a "ONE WAY" street...

	IN THE TORINO

	THRU THE WINDSHIELD: lots of cars heading this way.

						 NENA
				Interesting choice.

	Kittle lays on the horn, steering...

	ON THE ONE WAY STREET

	Chaos.  The Torino weaves thru traffic.  HORNS BLARE.
	Cars SMASH each other to avoid head-on collisions...

	Behind, the patrol car slows, breaking away, choosing
	another route.  But, the Mustang follows the Torino...

	Side-swiping other vehicles, SCRAPING past, RAGING FORWARD.

	Behind, Balls' Cadillac RAMS cars aside...
	Takes the path of least resistance: sidewalk...

	PLOWING THRU clothing racks and tables of a "SIDEWALK SALE."

	The Cadillac clips tall SCAFFOLDING on its way back to the
	street.  The scaffolding lets out a CREAKING GROAN...

	Scaffolding falls...
	In the street, drivers inspecting their crashed cars must
	now to run for their lives as scaffolding CRASHES DOWN.

	Above, WORKMEN hang from windowsills, screaming.

	AT THE END OF THE BLOCK

	The Torino hits open street, blasting forward.

	Congestion ahead, so the Torino cuts across sidewalk
	BOUNCING up a wide, marble staircase...

	IN AN OPEN AIR PLAZA

	A FOLK SINGER plays guitar and sings about "peace, love and
	happiness" for an audience gathered around a fountain.  Many
	others are picnicking on blankets nearby.

	The Torino ROARS as it reaches the top of the stairs...
	Heading straight for the crowd...

	Pigeons take flight.  People shriek and flee.  Many are
	knocked into the fountain.  The Torino cruises thru.

	Behind, the Mustang and Cadillac follow..

	ACROSS THE PLAZA

	The Torino RUMBLES down another staircase.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  MORE DOWNTOWN STREETS -- CHASE CONTINUES

	FOLLOW as the Torimo arrives, spinning out, moving on...

	RIPPING PAST cross streets...
	Gaining some distance on the Mustang and Caddie.

	Behind, the sguad car turns off one cross street,
	fishtailing to rejoin the chase.

	AHEAD

	Kittle takes the Torino down a long block...

	IN THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
					(daunted)
				Okay... it just got worse...

	THRU WINDSHIELD: busy CONSTRUCTION SITE.

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino races by signs: "LANE ENDS" and "ONE LANE AHEAD."

	The Torino halts at the rear of a long line of cars, ENGINE
	SNORTING.  Up front, a yawning FLAGMAN holds a "STOP" sign.

	Kittle sticks his head out, looking...
	Construction vehicles and a huge mound of dirt block the
	right lane.  Opposing traffic's coming thru on the left.

	Kittle sweats.  He looks back...
	Here they come: Mustang... Cadillac... squad car...

	IN THE TORINO

	Billy-Boy aims his shotgun out back.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Whatever we're gonna do, we should do
				it now.

	Kittle shifts, reverse, heading backwards...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Um... wrong way.  See, the bad men
				are back there, and we want to go
				away from them!

	ON THE STREET

	The Torino angles, stops, then heads forward, squeaking past
	the long line of cars... PICKING UP SPEED...

	IN THE TORINO

	AHEAD: the mound of dirt...
	WHIP PAN: to Nena, who realizes, looking to Kittle, who is
	intensely goal-focused, in a zone.

						 NENA
				You're... you're not doing what I
				think you're doing... ?

						 KITTLE
				Seatbelts fastened, please.

	Billy-Boy faces front, confused...

						 NENA
				Even if we make it.. which we
				won't... we don't know what's on
				the other side!

	Billy-Boy figures it out...

						 BILLY-BOY
				Oh, no... no, no, no!!

	ENGINE'S HUMMING.  Nena braces her feet on the dash, head
	between her knees.  Billy-Boy sees this, dizzy with fear...

						 BILLY-BOY
					(trying to be calm)
				Look, Kittle... pull over and let me
				out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How
				'bout that... ?
					(absolutely freaking)
				Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I
				don't want to die!!  Lemme out of
				this coffin!!

						 KITTLE
				Clench your teeth.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Wh... what... ?!

						 KITTLE
				Clench your teeth so when we land you
				don't accidentally bite off your
				tongue.

	Billy-Boy lets out a weak whimper, sits back, gripping
	ceiling straps and closing his eyes.

	ON THE STREET

	Construction workers dive for safety.
	The Torino hits the dirt mound, riding up....

	Taking flight...
	High above...

	Lands with a WHOOMP!, throwing dust, rocketing onward...

	IN THE TORINO

	Kittle gives a HOOT of joy.  Nena plants a kiss on him.  In
	back, Billy-Boy half-giggles/half-cries, giddy.

	ON THE STREET, BEHIND

	The Mustang ZOOMS off the dirt ramp... flying...
	Followed by Balls' Cadillac... skyward...

	They both land upright, surviving...

	BEHIND

	The squad car FLIES over the dirt mound... soaring...

	Something's wrong.  Off balance, slowly flipping...

	BOOOOOOOM! -- lands flat on its roof, pancaked!

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  L.A. RIVER BASIN -- CHASE CONTINUES

	A narrow spillway.  At the top, the Torino BASHES thru a
	chain-link gate, heading down...

	Into the far-as-the-eye-can-see expanses of the concrete
	Los Angeles River.  The Torino picks up the pace, riding the
	sloped wall.

	LONG-SHOT AERIAL VIEW: as the Mustang and Cadillac shadow
	the Torino.  Straightaway.  SPEEDS BECOME EXCESSIVE...

	IN THE TORINO

	Nena cranks a handle above, opening a SUNROOF.

	IN THE RIVER BASIN

	Nena stands up thru the sunroof, aiming two guns back...

	Behind, Poe slows, letting Balls' Cadillac take the lead.
	Thug-One leans out, FIRING a MACHINE GUN...

	Nena shoots, DOUBLE BLASTING...

	IN THE CADILLAC

	Thug-One's gun empties.  He leans in to reload.  He doesn't
	notice yet: Balls is a gory, bullet-ridden mess beside him,
	slumped against the steering wheel.

						 THUG-ONE
				Bitch can't hit a thing.

	Thug-One finishes loading, lets out a nervous laugh, glances
	at Balls' corpse... does a double-take...

	Thug-One looks forward, opening his mouth to scream...

	IN THE RIVER BASIN

	The Cadillac EXPLODES as it SLAMS a bridge abutment dead
	center.  Sounds like a THUNDER-CLAP.  HUGE FIREBALL...

	The Mustang bursts thru the flame, unrelenting...

	Kittle takes the Torino down off the wall...
	KNIFING thru shallow water...
	Up the opposite wall...

	The Mustang follows suit with Thug-Two SHOOTING...

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  GOLF COURSE -- CHASE CONTINUES

	Chain link fence borders the L.A. River.  A golf cart
	putters past.  The Torino and Mustang BUST up and out thru
	the fence, taking off across the golf course...

	ELSEWHERE

	On the tee, an elderly GENTLEMAN GOLFER, in plaid knickers
	and a pom-pom cap, tees off.  Good hit...

	He watches his ball go, squinting.  Far off, down the
	fairway, the Torino and Mustang cross the lush, rolling
	hills, EXCHANGING GUNFIRE...

	DOWN THE FAIRWAY

	The golf ball bounces off the hood of the Torino.

	UP ON THE TEE

	Gentleman Golfer watches the cars pass.  GUNSHOTS ECHO.

						 GENTLEMAN GOLFER
				That's peculiar.
					(long pause, to caddie)
				Winter rules, I suppose.

	FURTHER ON

	The Torino and Mustang clash, BUMPING each other...

	JOSTLING for position.  Really moving...
	The Torino heads downhill, swerving... BASHING the Mustang,
	guiding it... towards a SAND TRAP...

	Poe realizes too late, crying out...

	The Mustang hits the sand trap, WHEELS WHINING, SPINNING and
	THROWING SAND high in the air.  Immediately immobile.

	Poe pounds the wheel in frustration, going ape-shit.

	The Torino continues...

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  L.A. STREET -- CHASE CONTINUES

	The Torino BURSTS out from a line of thick shrubbery, onto a
	semi-busy street, joins the flow of traffic.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Big party.  Loud.  Party-goers move in the trippy flicker of
	STROBE LIGHTS, drinking and drugging.  Kittle, Nena and
	Billy-Boy arrive, scanning..

	In the middle of the' crowd, there's a NUDE WOMAN in only a
	mink coat standing on top a piano, writhing and laughing
	hysterically for no reason, non-stop; laughing and laughing
	and laughing, though we can't hear her over the din.

	Half the room's taken up by a makeshift indoor volleyball
	court, where men and women play NAKED VOLLEYBALL.  These
	aren't all "beautiful people" either.  There's plenty of
	middle-aged men and women who should have kept clothes on.

						 BILLY-BOY
				That's sick.

						 KITTLE
				Welcome to Beverly Hills.
				Wife-swapping Capital of the World.

	Kittle leads the way.  A big, NAKED BODY-BUILDER comes to
	block their path.  Kittle grimaces, afraid to look down.

						 NAKED BODY-BUILDER
				'Scuse me, fella... I need to see
				your invitations.

						 KITTLE
				Or what?  You gonna hit us over the
				head with your penis?

	Body-Builder grips Kittle.  Nena and Billy-B brandish guns.

						 NENA
				Take your baby-lotioned hands off
				him, Zeus.  Good.  Now, come here...

	IN A HALLWAY

	Nena leads Naked Body-Builder with her gun to his neck.

						 NENA
				You're gonna tell us where Archie the
				accountant is.  But first...

	She takes out HANDCUFFS, snaps one cuff around a doorknob
	and secures it, then holds up the other cuff.

						 NENA
				Try to guess which part of your
				body's going in here.

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, DISCO ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	MUSIC THROBS.  People dance, drenched, STROBE-LIT.  Bad
	fashion choices.  They're really shaking their bootie,
	banging asses together, grabbing and gyrating, oversexed.
	Kittle, Nena and Billy-B shove thru this jumble, moving on.

	EXT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, BACKYARD -- AFTERNOON

	On the porch, surrounded by coke mirrors and bowls of R,W+B
	pills, three nubile YOUNG WOMEN sit in the frothing HOT TUB,
	drinking champagne and giggling.

	Then, ARCHIE, a middle-aged, hairy-chested sleaze-ball in
	gold chains, pops up from under the water, laughing...

						 ARCHIE
				Now, that's what I call diving for --

	He's YANKED out of the hot tub by the chains around his
	neck, ending that sentence with a guttural CHOKE.

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, GARAGE -- AFTERNOON

	Archie's shoved into the garage, catches himself against his
	red Trans-Am, wet and vulnerable in his bathing suit.  He
	turns to face Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy.

						 ARCHIE
				This is private property.  This is
				breaking and entering!

						 KITTLE
				Just entering.  We'll get to the
				breaking in a minute.

	Archie's shifty, crosses his arms to cover nipples.

						 ARCHIE
				Whatever you fuzz are sniffing for, I
				don't have it.  You came to the wrong
				place.

	Kittle throws the ledger book and Archie catches it.

						 KITTLE
				You're Zimmermann's calculator,
				Archie.  All the blood money you had
				to move around to make this deal, you
				got to know something.  Maybe they
				told you, maybe you overheard things
				you weren't supposed to hear...

						 ARCHIE
				I'm telling you, you're barking up
				the wrong tree.

						 KITTLE
					(furious)
				Well, I'm running out of trees, so
				look me in the eye like a man and
				tell me you don't know!  Convince me!

						 ARCHIE
					(flinching, miserable)
				I don't know.  Fuck off!

						 NENA
					(studies Archie)
				You suck at lying, Archie.

						 KITTLE
				See... now that we know you know, the
				hard part's done for us.

						 NENA
				It's just a question of how long do
				we have to slap you silly till you
				spill the beans.

						 ARCHIE
				If this deal goes smooth, I clear
				three hundred fifty grand.  That's
				enough for three more houses like
				this.  And, what are you offering me
				instead, other than a black eye and a
				fat lip?

	Kittle motions.  Billy-Boy steps up, puts Archie in a choke.

						 ARCHIE
				Yeah... there, just like that...
					(submits)
				Okay, go ahead.  But first take a
				good look around at how I'm living,
				and then think about your own shitty
				lives...

	Kittle pushes Billy-Boy aside, GUT-PUNCHES Archie.  Archie's
	gasping.  Billy-Boy PUNCHES him, sends him sprawling.

						 ARCHIE
					(catching breath)
				I know the drill.  Maybe I can't stop
				you from beating on me... but, I'll
				heal up.  It doesn't change the fact
				that cops eat hamburgers and hot dogs
				while crooks eat lobster and caviar.

	Kittle KICKS.  Archie rolls.  Kittle comes to lift Archie up
	by gold chains, ready to punch again...

						 ARCHIE
					(weary, resigned)
				It's not even like there's a choice
				to be made, so... do whatever you
				feel like you have to do.

	Kittle's unsure.  He drops Archie, frustrated, leaving.

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle leads the way back across the volleyball room, angry,
	pushing stoned guests.  Billy-Boy lights up a cigarette.

						 NENA
				We're screwed.

						 KITTLE
				I'm well aware of that.

						 BILLY-BOY
				What's the plan?

						 KITTLE
				Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel
				free to shout it out, genius.

	Kittle glances up, stops.  He's focused above, loathing...

	ABOVE, on a balcony overlooking the party, ADAM, a gaunt,
	glassy-eyed blonde junkie in head-to-toe leather, smiles
	down.  He crooks his finger slyly; "come here."

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS ESTATE, UPSTAIRS BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Our three heroes follow Adam in, wary.  Dim room.  Candles.
	Adam sinks into a couch, puts his arm around EVE, a blonde
	misfit-addict also slathered in leather.

						 KITTLE
					(disgust, anger)
				Adam and Eve.  Never one without the
				other.

	Eve's fixing, shooting heroin...
	ZOOM-IN CLOSE-UP: on the needle piercing Eve's arm.

	Nena's riveted by this, instantly queasy, averts her eyes.

						 EVE
				That's our names, don't wear'em out.

	Eve laughs, so stoned.  She puts the needle aside.  Adam
	gropes her face and they flick tongues together.

	Billy-Boy puts a hand on Nena's shoulder.  Nena gives him a
	look to say she's okay, wiping sweat off her upper lip.

						 ADAM
					(to Eve, lovingly)
				Indivisible and inseparable.

						 KITTLE
				Incestuous.

						 ADAM
				Every person's got their own kinks,
				beef-cake.
					(stands, slinks forward)
				What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't
				swing?

	Adam rises to lavish attention, touching.  Kittle stews.

						 ADAM
				What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet
				up with you on the business end of a
				daisy chain.

						 KITTLE
					(shoves Adam off)
				Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start
				talking, or we're out the door.

						 ADAM
				A little birdie whispered in my ear
				today... about the needle-candy
				you're chasing.  It's up here...
					(taps his forehead)
				... in the old curiosity shop.

	Kittle looks questioningly to Nena and Billy-Boy, doubtful.

						 KITTLE
				How much?

						 ADAM
				I figure, for this information, the
				usual payment... times ten.

						 KITTLE
				You think it's that good?

						 ADAM
				I'll tell you what... I think it's
				all you've got.

						 KITTLE
					(false smile)
				Well... what can I do?  You've
				created a dilemma...
					(looks at watch)
				And, look at the that.
				Time's running out.  I wonder... how
				can I impress upon you just exactly
				how frustrating this situation is for
				me?

	Billy-Boy dutifully drops his cigarette, steps it out.  He
	grabs Adam and throws him across the room...

	Adam SMASHES a dresser and tumbles to the floor, smugness
	immediately replaced by shock and fear.

						 EVE
				Bastards... !

	Eve gets up, falls down, crawls to cradle Adam.

						 KITTLE
				You get nothing and like it.  And if
				we're not blissfully happy with what
				you tell us, we arrest you just for
				the fun of it.

						 ADAM
				Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I...
				I heard how the shit's arriving...
					(leans forward, whispers)
				It's coming in a Lincoln.

	Kittle's waiting for more.  There ain't more.

						 KITTLE
				And... ?

						 ADAM
				What and?  That's what I got.

						 KITTLE
				A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln
				Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five...
				Six... ?

						 ADAM
				Now you know what to watch for...

						 KITTLE
				Am I supposed to take this
				information and sit up in the hills
				with a frickin' telescope?

						 NENA
				This much powder you don't throw in
				the trunk with a blanket over it.
				It's got to be smuggled.

						 KITTLE
				There's not even enough places to
				stash it in a car.

						 ADAM
				Have I ever steered you wrong?

						 KITTLE
					(pissed, to Billy-Boy)
				Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two
				love birds say once they're sitting
				in separate cages.

	Billy-Boy pulls Eve off Adam, handcuffs her roughly as she
	kicks and protests.  Adam grabs at her, scared.

						 ADAM
				Get off her, monster!  Leave her
				alone... !

	Billy-Boy shoves Adam.  Nena restrains Adam, cuffing him.

						 KITTLE
					(to Billy-Boy)
				Take her down to the car, and for
				Christ's sake be careful this time.
					(to Adam)
				Last suspect he took in,
				butter-fingers dropped her down the
				stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we
				don't appreciate our arms and legs
				till we've lost the use of them?

						 ADAM
					(desperation rising)
				Hey, listen... I'll give you
				something else, Kittle.  Anything.
				Remember... remember that corpse
				washed up on Huntington Beach?  It
				was never identified...

						 KITTLE
				Who cares?

						 ADAM
				Alright, wait... there's a dentist in
				Brentwood peddling morphine...

						 KITTLE
					(ignores, to Billy-B)
				Careful she doesn't hit her head on
				the way.

	Billy-Boy drags Eve towards the door.

						 ADAM
				Come on, don't you screw with her,
				please!  You... you got to want this:
				armored car job.  CalTrust Bank.
				They took two million in cash...

						 KITTLE
				Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.

						 NENA
				Hold up a minute, Kittle.

	Nena drops Adam, motions for Kittle to follow her.  They
	huddle.  Nena whispers.

	Billy-B waits in the doorway with Eve, lights a cigarette.
	Kittle nods to Nena, then returns to Adam.

						 KITTLE
				We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if
				it's no good, we will hunt you down,
				and Billy-Boy will pull out your
				spine and he will beat you to death
				with it.

						 ADAM
					(relieved)
				Fair enough.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  WAREHOOSE HIDEOUT -- AFTERNOON

	A dirty window.  Kittle's face appears outside, peeking in
	thru grime.  He ducks away.  CAMERA MOVES...

	REVEALS an ARMORED CAR in the middle of the vast
	warehouse... and, away from the truck, SIX BANK ROBBERS,
	unwashed, frightening tough-guys, play poker, drink and
	smoke... and, nearby, a SUITCASE full of cash.  $2 million.

	EXT.  WAREHOUSE DISTRICT -- AFTERNOON

	Empty streets like a ghost town.  Late in the day.  The
	sun's low.  Kittle hurries back to the parked Torino.

	INSIDE THE TORINO

						 KITTLE
				They're there, laying low.  It's
				Allison and Hinchberger's crew.
				Lunatics, every one of 'em.

	Nena and Billy-Boy have duffel bags of guns on their laps,
	sorting and trading bullets, loading every gun.  Kittle
	picks up his own bag, following suit.

	For a while, that's the only sound, of guns checked and
	loaded.  In back, Billy-Boy takes a deep swallow from his
	flask.  Kittle turns his head, seeing this, faces front.

						 KITTLE
					(to Billy-Boy)
				When you planning to cut back on
				that?

						 BILLY-BOY
				What?

						 KITTLE
				The booze.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I don't know.  I could quit now if I
				wanted, I just don't want to.

						 NENA
					(skeptical)
				Sure you could.

	Billy-Boy studies his reflection in the flask, buzzed, sad.

						 BILLY-BOY
				I don't know what the problem is.
				Plenty of great men throughout
				history got their bravery out of a
				bottle

						 KITTLE
				Name one.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Dean Martin.

						 KITTLE
				Entertainers don't count.

	All the time, they're still occupied loading guns.

						 BILLY-BOY
				What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a
				decorated general in the Civil War?

						 NENA
				No.

						 BILLY-BOY
				General Jim Beam, then.

						 NENA
				Nope.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty
				common knowledge that in the Battle
				of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk
				off his ass.

						 KITTLE
				Who's been giving you history
				lessons?  Your bartender?

						 BILLY-BOY
				Okay, seriously.  What about
				Napoleon, huh?

						 KITTLE
				What about him?

						 BILLY-BOY
				You've never heard of Napoleon
				brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do
				you think it got its name?

						 NENA
				Billy, I love you I really do... but
				I've got to tell you, every day, in
				every way, you give new meaning to
				the word "stupidity."

						 BILLY-BOY
					(long pause)
				What can I say to that... except, I
				love you too, you mean-spirited
				bitch.

	In front, Nena allows a thin smile, still loading.  Kittle
	turns ON the RADIO: "Beth" by Kiss.

	Kittle switches: "Midnight at the Oasis," "Fly, Robin, Fly"
	by Silver Connection.  "The Night Chicago Died."  "Cats in
	the Cradle" by Harry Chapin.  "Da Doo Ron Ron" by Shaun
	Cassidy.   "Mr. Jaws."  "Billy Don't Be a Hero."  "Angie
	Baby."  Theme from t.v.'s "Happy Days."  "Nadia's Theme."

						 KITTLE
					(to Nena, calm)
				Excuse me...

	Kittle moves over, angling his body and lifting his heel so
	he can KICK the radio -- SMASHING the radio into SILENCE.

	Kittle sits back down and calmly continues loading.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  WAREHOUSE HIDEOUT -- AFTERNOON

	Big warehouse doors.  The Torino CRASHES thru!

	Across the warehouse, robbers leap to their weapons, running
	for cover behind big wooden crates and industrial drums.

	The Torino skids to stop, sideways...
	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy, wearing NYLONS stretched over
	their heads, jump out with duffel bags, taking cover behind
	the car.  Bullets THUNK against the Torino.

	Kittle's got got a BULLHORN, shouting into it.

						 KITTLE
					(thru bullhorn)
				... This is the police.  We don't
				want trouble... just come out with
				your hands up...

	The bank robbers peer out occasionally, FIRING sporadically.

						 KITTLE
					(thru bullhorn)
				Put down your weapons and surrender.
				I'm not kidding... this is your last
				chance.  Stop trying to kill us', or
				we will be forced to return fire...

	Robbers curse them, keeping up their uneven attack.

	BEHIND THE BARRELS, Several robbers are reloading, not too
	quick, dropping bullets in their haste.

	BEHIND THE TORINO, Kittle gives Nena and Billy-Boy a look
	and a shrug.  He tosses the bullhorn aside...

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy open duffel bags in front of
	then, choosing guns, rising...

	FIRING, six guns in all, one per hand...

	Wooden crates splinter.  Holes burst in metal drums.
	Several robbers are hit, bloodied.

	Our heroes keep BLASTING.  As soon as a gun empties, it's
	thrown aside in favor of another from a duffel bag,
	facilitating NON-STOP FIRING...

	One robber rises up, FIRING.  He's hit, falling, bloody.

	Poker chips and cards are sent flying...
	BULLETS are HEARD RICOCHETING everywhere, throwing sparks...

	Bank robbers are overwhelmed, hardly able to get in a shot.

	GUNSHOTS are DEAFENING as Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy
	continue SHOOTING.  Gunsmoke grows thick and empty guns pile
	up at their feet.

	One robber makes a run for an exit door, but he gets shot
	down on the way, falling, screaming.

	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy stop firing.  GUNSHOTS ECHO.

						 KITTLE
					(pause, shouting)
				If anybody's still alive over
				there... now would be a good time for
				you to run away.

	A pause.  Two remaining robbers run, reaching an exit door
	and escaping, not looking back.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  ARCHIE'S B.H. ESTATE, BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

	Archie's house.  Archie's in the shower.  PHONE'S RINGING.
	Archie gets a towel, answers the nearby phone.

						 ARCHIE
					(into phone)
				Yeah?
					(listens, impatient)
				I got nothing to say to you... huh?
				How's that...
					(interest piqued)
				I'm listening.

	CAMERA MOVES: to the ajar door.  Someone's there...

	IN THE ADJOINING BEDROOM

	A REDHEAD, one of the hot tub bikini girls, stands
	eavesdropping.  She crosses...

	Carefully picks up a phone, listening.

						 KITTLE'S VOICE (v.o.)
					(from phone)
				This is something you should
				seriously consider.  What do you say?

						 ARCHIE'S VOICE (v.o.)
					(pause, from phone)
				Meet me on Mulholland.  Above Outpost
				Drive...

	INT.  BEVERLY HILLS MANSIOH, KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

	Party MUSIC's still THROBBING elsewhere.  The Redhead moves
	thru waning weirdoes, reaches a phone, dialing.

						 REDHEAD
					(waits for answer,
					 whispers in phone)
				Hello?  Yeah... I need to talk to
				Mister Zimmermann.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE, LOOKOUT POINT -- AFTERNOON

	Kittle opens the SUITCASE filled with $2 million dollars.

						 KITTLE
				It's all yours.

	Archie tries not to let his excitement show, but he's awed.
	It's twilight.  They're on the road's narrow shoulder with
	the city beginning to sparkle behind.  Cars parked nearby.

						 BILLY-BOY
				You could start over again with cash
				like that.

						 NENA
				Go wherever you want.  Live how you
				want.

						 KITTLE
				No more counting the big money for
				someone else.

						 NENA
				Beholden to none.

	Archie's conflicted.  He touches the money, hands trembling.

						 KITTLE
					(looks at watch)
				It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing
				out.  Decide.

						 ARCHIE
				If I tell you, how do I know you
				won't just club me and take it back?

						 KITTLE
				You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not
				even in Vegas are you gonna get close
				to this kind of cash.
					(emphasizing)
				This is two million, Archie.  It's
				not three houses, it's twelve.  It's
				dreams come true.

	Archie's tempted, fearful.

						 NENA
					(whispers)
				Risk it.

	Archie stares at the money, trance-like.  Then, quietly:

						 ARCHIE
				It just got here.  Like you said, it
				took about a week from New York...

	Kittle, Billy-Boy and Nena share looks, can't believe.

						 ARCHIE
					(long pause)
				Three hundred kilos of White Lady
				hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham
				Lincoln.  A parade float.

						 KITTLE
				What... ?

						 ARCHIE
					(looks to Kittle)
				Abe Lincoln...

	FLASHBACK -- INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- DAYS AGO

	Coming down the road, hauled by a R,W+B pick-up truck: a
	giant ABE LINCOLN HEAD parade float, tacky and crude.

						 ARCHIE'S VOICE (v.o.)
				It's gonna be in the Bicentennial
				parade on Wilshire tonight.

	The float whizzes past.

	BACK TO SCENE ON MULHOLLAND

						 ARCHIE
				You see how perfect it is?  It's the
				fucking Trojan "horse," man.  Nobody
				suspects a thing...

	FLASHBACK -- TOWN FAIR -- A FEW DAYS AGO

	In a small town square, country folk gather to look at the
	Lincoln float and have pictures taken with it.

						 ARCHIE'S VOICE (v.o.)
				A gift from one city to another, but
				who's gonna ask who's giving the
				gift?  It's a great, big,
				paper-and-glue goodwill ambassador,
				stopping along the way to promote
				American values.

	FLASHBACK -- NEW YORK CITY WAREHOUSE -- A WEEK AGO

	Thugs load the lobotomized Abe float with BAGS of HEROIN.

						 ARCHIE'S VOICE (v.o.)
				Nobody imagines what's inside.  No
				cops are gonna search it, cause
				what's to search?  It's not a car.
				It's not a truck.  It's Abe Lincoln.

	BACK TO SCENE ON MULHOLLAND

						 ARCHIE
				All Zimmermann has to do is sit back
				at his party tonight and wait till
				the parade's done.  The floats go to
				some warehouse afterwards, where
				there's no guards cause it's all
				garbage in the morning anyhow.  So,
				while the city sleeps, Zimmermann's
				guys show up and empty it out.
					(smiles)
				It's that simple.

	GUNFIRE O.S.!  Bullets hit Archie...
	Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy turn, reaching for guns...

	Poe and TWO KILLERS stand on the road, FIRING...

	Kittle, Nena, Billy-Boy and Archie jerk and twist like
	puppets as BULLETS RIDDLE THEIR BODIES.

	The suitcase is hit, flipping off the ledge...
	Money dumps out into Mulholland canyon.

	Kittle, Nena, Billy-Boy and Archie collapse.  GUNFIRE STOPS.

	Poe walks over, inspecting.  Smoke wafts.  Kittle, Nena,
	Billy-Boy and Archie lie motionless in pools of blood.

	In the canyon, cash flutters down like a blizzard.

	Poe walks away, taking one killer with him up the street.

						 POE
					(to remaining killer)
				Finish it.

	The remaining KILLER goes to put a gun to Billy-Boy's head,
	pulls back the hammer... pulls the trigger -- CLICK.  Empty.

	Killer reloads, takes his time.  POE'S MUSTANG can be HEARD
	SCREECHING AWAY 0.S.  Killer puts the gun back to
	Billy-Boy's head, pulls back the hammer...

	With a sudden ROAR, Billy-Boy awakens, instinctively
	grabbing Killer's gun and yanking -- SNAPS Killer's arm.

	Billy-Boy grips Killer's head, twists -- BREAKS Killer's
	neck.  Killer's dead.  Billy-Boy rises, uneasy, looks
	around... falls back, unconscious.

											 FADE TO BLACK:

	Pause.  A VOICE from blackness: PRESIDENT GERALD FORD.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				Two hundred years ago we, the people
				of the United States of America,
				began a great adventure which stirred
				the imagination and quickened the
				hopes of men and women throughout the
				world.  The date was July 4, 1776;
				the occasion, the signing of our
				Declaration of Independence...

											 FADE IN:

	MONTAGE BEGINS -- INTERCUTTING -- NIGHT

	- On WILSHIRE BOULEVARD, the parade's readying.  Floats
	are guided round a corner: giant BALD EAGLE, massive
	REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIER with a musket... and, here comes the
	Abe Lincoln float, pulled by the R,W+B pick-up.

	- Marching bands mill about, NOISY, disorganized.

	- Sidewalks seethe with expectant spectators.

	- Boy Scout troops are lined up by den-leader dads.

	- Policemen chase a naked STREAKER.  The crowd jeers.

	- Baton twirling drum majorettes warm up.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				No other nation in history has ever
				dedicated itself more specifically
				nor devoted itself more completely to
				the proposition that all men are
				created equal, that they are endowed
				by their Creator with such
				unalienable rights of life, liberty,
				and the pursuit of happiness.

	- In a HOSPITAL EMERGEMCY ROOM, doors slam open: doctors
	and interns run all directions as Kittle, Nena, Billy-Boy
	and Archie are wheeled in on stretchers.  Pandemonium.

	- Kittle's bloody body is transferred to an operating
	table.  DOCTOR'S SHOUT ORDERS.  Oxygen's administered.

	- Surgical scissors cut blood-soaked clothing off Billy-Boy.
	Same goes for Nena, nearby.

	- Nena's pupils are checked with a flashlight.

	- Tubes are fed down Billy-Boy's throat.

	- Blood flows out bullet holes.

	- Needles are inserted into veins.

	- Bloody slugs are dropped in a bowl with a METALLIC PING.

	- Archie's face is covered by a sheet.  Dead.

	- Kittle gets ELECTRIC SHOCK -- his body convulses.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				Two centuries later, as we celebrate
				our Bicentennial Year of
				Independence, the great American
				adventure continues. ... Colonists
				and immigrants brought with them
				cherished values and ideals in
				religion and in culture, in law and
				learning which, mixed with the native
				American ways, gave us our rich
				American heritage.

	- At ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, champagne corks pop!  People
	cheer.  A COSTUME PARTY'S beginning in the great room.
	Distinguished guests flow in.  Lots of whores.

	Across the room, THUGS drink at a fully stocked bar, each
	dressed as a REDCOAT.  Poe's amongst them, dressed as BEN
	FRANKLIN, granny glasses and all.

	- The butler greets guests in the foyer.

	- Guests accept R,W+B hors d'oeuvres.

	- Elsewhere, Zimmermann's entrance is met by applause.
	He's UNCLE SAM, adjusting his top hat and paste-on beard.

	- Guests gather round a TELEVISION showing the beginnings of
	the parade on Wilshire.

	- A STRING QUARTET plays.  Nearby, Zimmermann gives Poe an
	appreciative slap on the back.  They share a laugh.

	- Guests share cocaine off coke-spoon necklaces.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				The unique American union of the
				known and the unknown, the tried and
				the untried, has been the foundation
				for our liberty and the secret of our
				great success.  In this country,
				individuals can be the masters rather
				than the helpless victims of their
				destiny.  We can make our own
				opportunities and make the most of
				them...

											 END MONTAGE:

	INT.  KITTLE'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

	President Ford's SPEECH CONTINUES from the TV.  Kittle's in
	the bed, bandaged all over, unconscious.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				In the space of two centuries, we
				have not been able to right every
				wrong, to correct every injustice, to
				reach every worthy goal

	Kittle stirs.  He opens his bleary eyes.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				But for 200 years, we have tried and
				we will continue to strive to make
				the lives of individual men and women
				in this country and on this Earth
				better lives -- more hopeful and
				happy, more prosperous and peaceful,
				more fulfilling and more free.

	Kittle tries to sit up, in terrible pain.

						 PREZ FORD (v.o.)
				This is our common dedication, and it
				will be our common glory as we enter
				the third century of the American
				adventure.

	Kittle looks to the T.V. as it switches coverage, now
	SHOWING COVERAGE of the BICENTENNIAL PARADE on Wilshire.

	Kittle stares at this, then rises, barely, looks to a
	privacy curtain.  He begins the slow climb out of bed.

	BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Kittle looks in.  Billy-Boy's out cold,
	stained bandages around his head, tubes up his nose.
	Kittle's eyes fill with tears and anger.

						 KITTLE
					(quiet sorrow)
				What'd they do to my boy?

	Kittle touches Billy-Boy's face, gentle.  Suddenly,
	Billy-Boy's awake -- gripping Kittle's throat!

						 KITTLE
					(choked)
				... Billy, no... it's... me...

	Billy-Boy sees it's Kittle and releases.  Kittle gasps.
	Billy-Boy pulls tubes out of his body, touches his head
	wound, looking around, dazed.

						 BILLY-BOY
				They... they shot me.

						 KITTLE
				They shot us all, kid.

						 BILLY-BOY
				What day is it?

						 KITTLE
				Same day as before.  I think.

	Billy-Boy gets up, in extreme pain, one leg in a
	knee-to-heel cast.  Kittle helps him out of bed.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Where we going?

						 KITTLE
				We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's
				parade.

	INT.  HOSPITAL, NENA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

	Kittle and Billy-Boy sneak in.  They're pale, wounds
	bleeding fresh in their bandages.  Kittle goes to check a
	chart at the end of a bed.

						 KITTLE
					(to bed, whispers)
				Nena.  Nena...

	Kittle pulls the sheet, finds only PILLOWS placed to look
	like a body.  A LIGHT FALLS ACROSS him from behind...

	Kittle and Billy-Boy turn.  The bathroom door's falling
	open, revealing Nena, arm in a sling, struggling to tighten
	a piece of cloth around her wounded leg.

	Nena looks up, noticing them, manages a frail smile.

						 NENA
				Well, don't just stand there... help
				a lady tighten her tourniquet.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

	Many cop cars arriving.  D.A. Ravich and the POLICE CHIEF
	climb out from one.  FOLLOW as they join a throng of
	policemen heading to the hospital.

						 D.A. RAVICH
					(to Police Chief)
				I want men guarding their rooms.  As
				soon as they wake up, I want them
				booked.  If they die, I want their
				dead bodies arrested.

	BEHIND, another squad car halts.  Officer Steve and Officer
	Jim, in unwieldy neck braces, get out from the back.

	INT.  HOSPITAL, KITTLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

	Cops enter, Officers Steve and Jim amongst them.  D.A.
	Ravich and Police Chief push to front, stopping cold...
	ZOOM IN: on Billy-Boy and Kittle's empty beds.

	INT.  HOSPITAL, NENA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

	D.A. Ravich and Police Chief rush in with cops.  Same story:
	Nena's bed empty.  There's a POUNDING HEARD and MUFFLED CRY.
	Police Chief goes to open a closet...

	Finds a SECURITY GUARD, bound and gagged, on the floor.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

	Paramedics unload an ambulance.  Nurses assist, guiding the
	stretcher in.  Kittle, Nena and Bllly-Boy hobble past,
	unnoticed in all the activity.

	Kittle drops a gun, scrambles to pick it up.  He, Billy-B
	and Nena climb in the ambulance.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

	The purloined ambulance, SIREN WAILING, moves past running
	policemen, past cop cars, to the street...

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE, LOOKOUT POINT -- NIGHT

	Where the shooting took place is a crime scene, roped off.
	DETECTIVES work.  The Torino's still here.

	A SIREN is HEARD... GETTING CLOSER.

	The ambulance arrives, snapping police tape as it hurtles
	forward, SKIDDING -- rearends a detective's car, sending the
	car forward and over the edge into the canyon...

	BELOW

	Policemen, collecting money from foliage, flee.  The car
	tumbles down... rolling... BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

	ABOVE

	Our heroes, still in gowns, stumble out the ambulance.
	Billy-Boy falls and Nena helps him up while Kittle levels
	his gun shakily at the stupefied detectives.

						 KITTLE
				Everybody take off your clothes.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOLLYWOOD STREET -- NIGHT

	The Torino rides again...

	INSIDE THE TORINO

	Our ragged heroes wear stolen, ill-fitting clothing.  Nena
	tightens bandages.  In back, Billy-Boy preps weapons from
	the trunk via the trap door.

						 KITTLE
				How you doing back there?

						 BILLY-BOY
				Feeling great.
	    
	Blood flows out his nose.  He wipes it, trying to ignore.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(coughs harshly)
				Feels like there's a bullet still in
				my chest.

						 NENA
				There probably is.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(keeps working)
				Bummer.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  WILSHIRE BOULEVARD CROSS STREET -- NIGHT

	MARCHING BAND MUSIC 0.S.  Torino's parked, trunk open.
	Kittle, Billy-B (in football helmet) and Nena unload their
	trusty gun duffels, shotgun suitcase and box of dynamite.

	They trek toward Wilshire, toward the crowd with its back to
	them, where the parade flows past.

											 CUT TO:

	INT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, GREAT ROOM -- NIGHT

	CLINKING a fork against a wine glass, Zimmermann calls for
	attention.  Guests clear a space around him.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				A moment of your time, friends!  A
				mere moment...
					(waits for quiet)
				I welcome you, on this the occasion
				of America's 200th birthday.  Times
				like this, I become a sentimental
				dolt, so I beg your indulgence.

	EXT.  WILSHIRE BOULEVARD -- NIGHT

	On the sidewalk, Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy are at the front
	of the crowd, watching.  Kittle's looking around, above...

	A T.V. CAMERA shoots the parade from atop a high platform...
	WHIP PAN: to another T.V. CAMERA across the street, covering
	the festivities from another angle.

	Nena nudges Kittle and points...
	the Lincoln float's on its way.

	A MARCHING BAND slows.  The Lincoln float stops behind.  The
	DRIVER, a broken-nosed thug, looks impatient.  SPEAKERS on
	the float BLAST "Stars and Stripes Forever."

	The pick-up's door opens and Billy-Boy pulls the driver out
	and throws him.  Behind, Nena and Kittle toss weapons on the
	float, struggling to climb on.

	INT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION, GREAT ROOM -- NIGHT

	Zimmermann continues his address.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Our country has been called the land
				of opportunity.
				And, a wiser man than I once made the
				observation that the older you get,
				the longer it takes you to get to the
				door when opportunity knocks.
					(laughter from guests)
				But, didn't Thomas Jefferson say it
				best when he said...
					(sees something O.S.,
					 sudden horror and fury)
				Motherfucking cocksuckers!!  I'll...
				I'll kill them... !

	Guests are startled.  Zimmermann pushes thru to the
	television, reddening with rage, quaking in disbelief.

	ON THE TELEVISION: Kittle, Nena and Billy-Boy on the Lincoln
	float, blood stains beginning to show thru their clothing,
	waving wearily to cameras.  T.V. ANNOUNCERS in V.0. express
	confusion as the float turns off course...

	EXT.  WILSHIRE BOULEVARD -- NIGHT

	Billy-Boy drives, accelerates, spins the wheel...
	Guides the Lincoln float off the parade route and onto a
	side street as the panicked crowd parts like the Red Sea.

	T.V. cameras turn to follow as the float lumbers away.

	On the float, Nena looks to Kittle.

						 NENA
				Think Zimmermann's watching?

						 KITTLE
				Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out
				soon enough.

	EXT.  ZIMMERMANN'S MANSION -- NIGHT

	Redcoat/thugs run from the house, scrambling to black
	Cadillacs.  Zimmermann follows, shouting...

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Wilshire Boulevard!  Wilshire
				Boulevard!  Kill them!!

	Zimmermann gets in the passenger side of his white Cadillac.
	They ride.  Poe follows in the super Mustang.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  URBAN STREETS -- NIGHT

	FOLLOW the float.  Kittle stares up at giant Lincoln.

						 KITTLE
				It turns my stomach they're using
				Honest Abe to smuggle their filth.

	Nena opens the suitcase, hands a shotgun to Kittle.  Kittle
	limps aft, aims at the back of Abe Lincoln's head...

						 KITTLE
				Sorry, old buddy.

	BOOM!  White powder leaks out from behind Abe's left ear.

						 NENA
				You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.

						 KITTLE
					(to the pick-up)
				Billy!  Billy!

	Kittle moves to the front, shouting.  In the pick-up, Billy
	glances back, them watches thru the mirror.

						 KITTLE
				Take us to the beach!  Santa
				Monica... !  The beach!

	Billy-Boy finally nods, gives thumbs-up to show he heard.

	IN THE PICK-UP

						 BILLY-BOY
					(to himself)
				The beach... the beach...

	Billy-Boy's eyes flutter.  He's sweaty, trying to stay
	conscious.  He shakes himself, forcing his eyes wide.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(to himself)
				Alright, big-fella, don't you go
				passing out!  You're fine and dandy.
				You've had worse than this.

	He forces a laugh.  Blood trickles down his forehead.  He
	takes a pack of cigarettes off the dash.

	THRU THE WINDSHIELD: yellow traffic light... turning red.

	Billy-Boy goes for it...

	ON THE STREET

	Billy-Boy flouts the intersection, barely missing collision.

	On the float, Nena starts checking over guns.  Kittle kneels
	behind Abe Lincoln's head, opening the box of dynamite.

						 NENA
				Why the beach?

						 KITTLE
				So there's nobody around to get
				killed in the explosion.

	Nena's confused.  Kittle takes dynamite from the box and
	starts shoving it into Abe's head cavity, smiles at Nena.

						 NENA
					(matter of fact)
				Oh, yeah... the explosion.

						 KITTLE
				Know what I love about dynamite?

						 NENA
				Do tell.

						 KITTLE
				When you bunch it together, it's
				exponentially more powerful.  Two
				sticks have the power of four sticks.
				Four sticks have the power of
				sixteen, and so on.
 
						 NENA
				I don't think so.

						 KITTLE
				Well, that's what I heard, and that's
				what I choose to believe.

	EXT.  OTHER URBAN STREETS -- NIGHT

	Zimmermann's Cadillacs are on the prowl.  Poe follows.

	EXT.  YET ANOTHER URBAN STREET -- NIGHT

	Zimmermann's' Cadillac convoy rounds another corner...
	Poe's Mustang breaks formation, heading elsewhere...

	ON A SIDE STREET

	The Mustang cruises, a strange sight since Poe's at the
	wheel still in his elaborate Ben Franklin get-up and there's
	a fully uniformed Redcoat in the passenger seat.

	INSIDE THE MUSTANG

	The thug beside Poe, REDCOAT-ONE, keeps an eye out...
	DOWN THE BLOCK: a glimpse of Abe crossing.

						 REDCOAT-ONE
					(pointing)
				There!  Over there... !

							    KITTLE
			    Know what I love about dynamite?

	EXT.  URBAN STREET -- NIGHT

	In the pick-up, Billy-Boy sees the Mustang arrive, heading
	this way.  He BEEPS and leans out, shouting back.

						 BILLY-BOY
				Kittle... we got company!

	Kittle and Nena look.

	Im the Mustang, Poe talks in his CB RADIO, closing.

	Nena throws her duffel over her shoulder by a strap, starts
	up a ladder at the back of Lincoln's head.

	Billy-Boy points a gun out his window.

	Redcoat-One leans out with a machine gun...

	The pick-up and Mustang TRADE GUNFIRE as they THUNDER past
	in opposite directions...

	Nena reaches the top of Lincoln's stovepipe hat, hurting.

	BEHIND, the Mustang u-turns to pursue.  And, FURTHER BACK,
	the Cadillacs arrive, SCREEEEEECHING; one white, two black.
	Here they come, GUNS BLAZING.

						 NENA
				The gang's all here!

						 KITTLE
				Keep 'em busy.

	Kittle keeps loading dynamite, hurried.
	Poe's Mustang and the Cadillacs close in.

	Zimmermann leans out the white Caddie, demented, his Uncle
	Sam beard flapping in the breeze, FIRING A MACHINE GUN...

	On the float, Nena RETURNS FIRE from above.

	Below, Kittle wrestles a plastic bag of heroin out of
	Lincoln's head, moves back, keeping low...
	He chucks the heroin bag...

	The bag SLAMS the windshield of one black Cadillac with a
	blinding POOF!  Wipers come on.

	INSIDE THE WHITE CADILLAC

						 ZIMMERMANN
				That's my heroin!
					(to REDCOAT-DRIVER)
				Move it!  Get beside the son of a
				bitch!  Now, now, now!

	ON THE STREET

	The white Cadillac gets close.  Zimmermann FIRES.

						 ZIMMERMANN
				Die, Kittle... you self-righteous
				prick!

	On the float, Kittle cowers.  BULLETS RIP Abe's head.

	INSIDE THE PICK-UP

	Billy-Boy corners, hard...

	ON THE STREET

	Cutting the corner short, blocking the white Cadillac and
	DECAPITATING a FIRE HYDRANT!  Instant water fountain.

	Atop Lincoln's hat, Nena hangs on tight.

											 CUT TO:

	EXT.  URBAN STREETS, FURTHER ON -- CHASE CONTINUES

	In the middle of the street, five CHILDREN are huddled.  A
	flickering flame lights their faces.  They have a G.I. JOE
	DOLL propped up, trying to light the firecracker wedged
	under its arm.  The fuse sparks.

	The children run, squealing with delight, turning to watch
	from the safety of the sidewalk.  The fuse gives off a
	sizzle.  The children wait... and wait.  Meanwhile, "Stars
	and Stripes Forever" can be HEARD distant.

						 ONE CHILD
					(disappointment)
				Dud.

	GUNSHOTS are HEARD.  The children look...
	Here comes the Lincoln float.

	It ZOOMS past, followed by the Mustang and Cadillacs...

	Gunplay...
	Loud patriotic music...
	Giant Abe Lincoln.

	The children watch, awed.  It's gone.  They're still staring
	off in wonder as relative quiet returns.

	In the street, G.I. Joe's arm gets blown off with a "pop."

	FURTHER ON

	FOLLOW the Lincoln float.  Kittle's adding more t.n.t.

	IN THE WHITE CADILLAC

	Zimmermann raises his machine gun, aiming, pauses...

	ZIMMERMANN'S P.O.V. -- KITTLE

	ZOOM IN: on Kittle and the dynamite-filled hole.

	IN THE WHITE CADILLAC

	Zimmermann realizes what Kittle's doing.  Dread.  Zimmermann
	grabs the microphone of his CB.

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(into radio)
				Hold your fire!  You hear... ?

	IN POE'S MUSTANG

	Redcoat-One's SHOOTING.  From the CB:

						 ZIMMERMANN'S VOICE (v.o.)
					(from radio, garbled)
				Hold your fire, Goddamn it!  You'll
				blow it up!

	ON THE STREET

	Above on the float, Nena FIRES down...
	Keeping the villains' cars at bay.

	Below, Kittle pulls the fuse of one stick of dynamite with
	his teeth, lengthening it, then searches his pockets for a
	lighter... remembers these aren't really his pockets.

						 KITTLE
				Damn it!

	Kittle looks to the pick-up, sees cigarette smoke.

	IN WHITE CADILLAC

						 ZIMMERMANN
					(into microphone)
				Run them off the road!  Shoot the
				driver!  Just don't shoot Abraham
				Lincoln!

	ON THE STREET

	Kittle moves to the front, makes the short leap into the bed
	of the pick-up.  Short leap, but harshly painful for a man
	in Kittle's condition.  He continues...

	IN THE PICK-UP

	Kittle leans around to Billy-Boy's window.

						 KITTLE
				Gimmie a butt.

						 BILLY-BOY
				You don't smoke.

						 KITTLE
				I'm not taking a cigarette break,
				jackass, just give me one!

	Billy-Boy takes the pack from his pocket and offers it.
	Kittle slaps the pack away, takes the lit cigarette sticking
	out from Billy-Boy's helmet facemask and exits.

						 BILLY-BOY
					(indignant, to Kittle)
				Rude!

	ON THE STREET

	Kittle's heading back, but stops, looking down...

	In the pick-up, sticking out from under a blanket, there's a
	cardboard BOX labeled "Caution: FLAMMABLE."
	Kittle shrugs, takes the box...

	He leaps back onto the float, falls, gets up, returning to
	the hole behind Lincoln's ear.

	Kittle opens the box, pleased to find big, rocket-like
	FIREWORKS, which he quickly starts cramming in the hole.

	Above, Nena's gun empties.  She flattens, reloading as best
	she can with only one functioning hand.

	Behind, one black Cadillac comes ahead.

	On board the float, Kittle finishes filling the hole and
	grabs his box of dynamite, moving back, and...
