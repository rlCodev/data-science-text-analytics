FADE IN:

EXT. LONDON SKYLINE - DUSK

1

PANNING DOWN from the heavens to the city below. Seen from
the East End looking west. Traffic in the streets, the
Thames, St. Paul’s. The BELLS at Bow Church can be heard.
FRANCES (V.O.)
London in the 1960’s. Everyone had a
story about the Krays. You could
walk into any pub to hear a lie or
two about them.

EXT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - ROLLING THE WEST END - NIGHT

2

We are low on the rear fender looking up, awash in neon:
Ronnie Scott’s, the Marquee Club. We catch glimpses of the
pretty people passing by.
FRANCES (V.O.)
But I was there and I am not
careless with the truth.

INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - ROLLING THE WEST END - NIGHT

3

In the backseat, the Krays: REGGIE tough and fit, RON off
kilter in style. An odd slowness here, like time has stood
still. Are they on their way to gangster heaven?
FRANCES (V.O.)
They were brothers. But bound by
more than blood, they were twins as
well. Counterparts. Gangster princes
of the city they meant to conquer.
Ron, heavier, thicker, bespectacled, looks to his brother.
FRANCES (V.O.)
Ron Kray was a one man London mob.
Bloodthirsty, illogical, but funny
as well.
Reggie looks out the window watching London pass by.
FRANCES (V.O.)
Reggie was different. Once in a
lifetime do you find a street
fighting man like Reg. Believe me
when I say it took a lot of love for
me to hate him the way I do.

INT./EXT. 178 VALLANCE ROAD - BETHNAL GREEN - DAY

4

ON REGGIE KRAY’S back. Follow him as he strides, a boxer’s
roll to his shoulders. Out onto VALLANCE ROAD. His patch.
Full of mischief, Reggie carries TWO TEA CUPS down and across
the street to where a sedan is parked.
The driver is Constable SCOTT. His passenger is Scotland Yard
Inspector NIPPER READ.
REGGIE
Hello, boys. Fancy a cup of tea?
They just look away. Reggie checks out the car.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
What’s this, the old Dagenham
Anglia? Nought to sixty in 20
minutes. It suits you, all black and
cramped.
(re: tea; to Scott)
Milk and sugar? Yes? No?
CONSTABLE SCOTT
Shove off, Kray.
Reggie leans low so he can see Nipper.
REGGIE
Hello, Nipper. Don’t want to keep
you. Not with all the murderers to
catch and rapists to lock away.
Nipper just stares. Reggie heads off, dumping the tea in the
street as he goes. He hands the cups to Donoghue who waits
over by a sleek looking, powerful FORD GALAXY 500.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Where’s my driver? Where’s Frank?
DONOGHUE
He ain’t here. Can’t get out of bed
in the morning, Reg. His heart ain’t
in it.
REGGIE
Well, let’s go get him then. Ormsby
Street, right?
Donoghue nods, opens the passenger door. Reg shakes his head.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
No, I could use the walk. Lovely day
for it.
Reggie turns, smiles at and motions Nipper to follow.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Come on then!
As Reggie starts down Vallance Road, Donoghue sighs, shakes
his head and gets inside the Galaxy.

INT. ANGLIA - ROLLING DOWN VALLANCE ROAD - DAY

Nipper watching from the Anglia as the Galaxy (driven by
Donoghue) follows Reggie who strolls along. He tussles a
KID’S hair, greets an OLD WOMAN. He’s GREETED back warmly.
NIPPER
Eastenders. They won’t talk to a
policeman, but they’ll kiss a
gangster.
As Nipper shakes his head in disgust...

EXT. HOUSE - ORMSBY STREET - BETHNAL GREEN - DAY

Reggie knocks on the door. And FRANCES SHEA answers, the
future Mrs. Kray. Reggie looks at her a beat.
REGGIE
Is Frank about?
She considers and after a moment calls back over her shoulder
into the house. Toward the hallway stairs behind her.
Frank!

FRANCES

Reggie really checks her out now.
REGGIE
Who are you?
FRANCES
Frances. Frank’s sister.

Final Shooting Draft

REGGIE
Hang on, I know you. But you were
just a girl. You’ve all grown up,
haven’t you?
Frances is rolling something around in her mouth.
It happens.

FRANCES

REGGIE
What have you got there?
Meaning her mouth. She laughs, takes a CANDY out of her mouth
with her thumb and forefinger, shows it to Reggie.
A sweet.

FRANCES

REGGIE
Lemon sherbet?
(Frances nods)
Gives us a few sucks on it?
He opens his mouth. She smiles, drops it in. Reggie rolls it
around in his mouth, nods at the taste.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh, that’s nice. But a bit early,
isn’t it?
FRANCES
Mum still makes me take a tonic in
the morning. Sweet’s the only thing
that’ll chase off the taste.
Reggie crunches. Frances reacts.
FRANCES (CONT’D)
You’re not supposed to chew it.
REGGIE
No? How else am I supposed to get at
the sherbetty bit?
FRANCES
By being patient.
REGGIE
No, patience doesn’t get you what
you want.

Final Shooting Draft

5.

The sound of a window raising. Reggie looks up to see FRANK
SHEA looking down from the second floor. In a T-shirt and bedheaded. Horrified when he sees who is waiting.
FRANK SHEA
Half a minute, Reg. Right down.
Frank ducks back in. Reggie frowns, checks his watch.
FRANCES
Is my brother in trouble?
REGGIE
(nods; then...)
Would you go out with me? I’ll take
it easy on him if you do.
FRANCES
Yes, but not for that reason.
REGGIE
Saturday night?
She nods again. Suddenly, her mother MRS. SHEA is there.
MRS. SHEA
Who are you talking to?
She sees Reggie, obviously doesn’t think much of him.
MRS. SHEA (CONT’D)
You’re half dressed talking to a man
in the door. What’s wrong with you,
Frances? Get back in the kitchen.
Finish them dishes.
Frances shrugs at Reggie who takes the sweet from his mouth,
offers it back. Her mother watches as she takes it, pops it
in her mouth as she goes. Reggie smiles rakishly.
Mrs. Shea slams the door in his face.

Frank drives. Donoghue beside him. Reggie coiled in the back.
Silent. Frank obviously nervous, concentrating on the road.
REGGIE
Oversleep again, Frank, and it’s
back to the cheese shop or the chip
shop or whatever shop you came from.

Final Shooting Draft

FRANK SHEA
Print. Print shop.
REGGIE
Do you understand what I’m saying?
You’ll be headed to the shit shop.
(after a beat)
What does your sister do?
FRANK SHEA
She goes to one of those Pitman
Colleges. Typing, shorthand.
Donoghue shaking his head, looks back for the Anglia.
REGGIE
Girl’s got a bit of class, mate. How
come I haven’t seen her? Where you
been hiding her?
FRANK SHEA
She’s been away.
(a beat)
She’s a bit fragile, Reg.
Yeah?

REGGIE

Frank just nods and that’s the end of it. As they drive...
DONOGHUE
Stop here, Frank.
As Frank pulls to the curb...

EXT. NARROW LANE - DAY (SAME)

As Donoghue and Reggie exit the Galaxy, start walking. The
Anglia pulls in fifty feet behind.
DONOGHUE
(shouts to Nipper)
Five minutes! Won’t be long!
From Nipper’s angle it looks like they’re entering a
BUILDING. But from Reggie and Donoghue’s angle...
They’ve entered a...

NARROW WALKING ALLEY
They’re giving Nipper the slip.

Reggie and Donoghue nowhere in sight. As Nipper realizes he’s

RON KRAY

Looks nearly at camera. As Ron speaks we cannot see to whom.
RON
And I’m staring at the back of this
geezer’s head. Drilling him with my
eyes. The whole time thinking, give
Ron Kray your sausage. Give Ron your
fucking sausage. Until I’m not
thinking it anymore; I’m
broadcasting it, Ron Kray sausage,
through his skull and into his
brain. Till he looks back at me and
says, “Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I got no appetite this morning.”
(lets it sink in)
Interesting, ain’t it?
FRANCES (V.O.)
When my future brother-in-law said
interesting, it meant he had no
fucking idea what he, or you, or
anyone else was talking about.
WIDEN: Ron sits across from Reggie and Donoghue in the...
13

INT. DAY ROOM AT LONG GROVE HOSPITAL - DAY

Ron has glasses, wears a comfy old jumper. All the patients
here in their own clothes. Reggie looks at Donoghue: his
brother is mad as a March hare.
FRANCES (V.O.)
Ron had been sentenced to three
years in prison for Grievous Bodily
Harm.

FRANCES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Near the end of his sentence he was
certified insane and remanded to a
mental hospital. What was wanting
was a friendly psychiatrist.

BIG PAT CONNOLLY LYING ON A PSYCHIATRIST’S COUCH

14

Big Pat is, in fact, enormous Pat. DR. HUMPHRIES frowns as
the couch creaks under the big man’s weight.
HUMPHRIES
When you say you want to raspberry
this man, I’m not sure of your
vernacular. What do you mean?
BIG PAT
Raspberry ripple - cripple.
HUMPHRIES
You want to cripple someone?
BIG PAT
Yep, that’s right.
HUMPHRIES
And why is that?
BIG PAT
Because, doctor, I’m afraid he may
not be inclined to provide a
favorable evaluation of my employer.
Said softly, his sausage size fingers laced over his chest.
HUMPHRIES
And who is your employer?
BIG PAT
Ronnie Kray. Is there hope, Doctor?
HUMPHRIES
Excuse me a moment.
15

RECEPTION AREA

15

Humphries enters, starts purposely toward his SECRETARY. He
stops short at the sight of a second ENORMOUS MAN sitting in
his waiting area. He’s cracking his huge knuckles.
HUMPHRIES
Who is that?

SECRETARY’S VOICE

Humphries stands to address the PSYCHIATRIC BOARD. Seated at
a table behind him is Ron who stares.
HUMPHRIES
Ronald Kray possesses possibly the
soundest mind I’ve seen in twentysix years of psychiatric practice.
In my view to keep him here would be
a waste of public resources.
Humphries slumps back down in his chair, mutters to himself:
HUMPHRIES (CONT’D)
A lifetime’s integrity down the
toilet.
Ron looks over at him, sure that he willed it...
FRANCES (V.O.)
The Queen would survive, but God
save the rest of us.

They both turn as DOCTOR HUMPHRIES heads briskly over, fresh
from the hearing.
HUMPHRIES
I hope you know what you’re doing.
REGGIE
I know exactly what I’m doing.
Driving back to London.

Final Shooting Draft

10.

HUMPHRIES
Your brother has no real idea who or
what he is. Nor does he trust his
own senses. I’ve never seen a man so
desperately in need of reassurance.
REGGIE
Well, we all like a compliment now
and then, don’t we?
HUMPHRIES
This is not a joke. Ron exists in a
fantasy world. He’s a man in a house
of mirrors.
REGGIE
Do you understand what he’s on
about, Albert?
Donoghue shakes his head, neither giving the Doc an inch.
HUMPHRIES
What I’m on about is your brother is
arbitrary, violent and psychopathic.
Probably paranoid schizophrenic.
What I’m trying to tell you is he’s
off his spinning top!
Humphries steps up, takes Reggie’s hand and slaps a BOTTLE OF
PILLS down, angrily explains:
HUMPHRIES (CONT’D)
It’s called Stematol. You need to
give it to your brother twice a day.
Twice a day or there’s going to be
fucking trouble.

FRANK SHEA
You’ve got glamour, Frances. You’re
like an East End starlet.
Mrs. Shea arrives, wearing an apron and drying her hands.
MRS. SHEA
East End harlot is more like it.
As Frances reacts to the stinging words...
FRANK SHEA
They’re trousers, Mum. She doesn’t
look like a harlot.
MRS. SHEA
What she’s wearing doesn’t matter.
When people see her with Reggie
Kray, they’ll think she’s a tart.
FRANCES
Why would you say that?!
MRS. SHEA
He’s a gangster, Frances! The Krays
are gangsters!
As Mrs. Shea stomps away, Frances watches after her...
FRANCES
I think he’s sweet! And I’m going to
kiss him, do you hear me?!

REGGIE - OUTSIDE THE SHEA HOUSE - EVENING (SAME)

Leaning against his CONTINENTAL, a bit of danger in a sharp

A drab East End street. The Continental pulls up and Reggie
gets out, opens the door for Frances.
MOVE WITH them as they cross to where a 300-pound Glasgwegian
doorman stands. It’s Big Pat from the psychiatrist’s office.
REGGIE
Hello, Big Pat.
BIG PAT
Reggie. Miss.
REGGIE
Big Pat’s here to keep the riff raff
out.
(Pat nods sagely)
So how come you’re letting us in?
Frances laughs. We FOLLOW THEM past Big Pat and inside into a
whole other world...

INT. DOUBLE R CLUB - OUTER ROOM - NIGHT

An eclectic crowd. Reggie greets Firm member IAN BARRIE who’s
parked at the bar. As Reggie continues to lead Frances
further in, anyone who sees him says ‘Hello’.
FRANCES
Everyone here knows you.
REGGIE
Of course. This is my club.
FRANCES
You mean it’s your local?
REGGIE
I mean I own the place.
FRANCES
I’ve been by here ten times; I never
knew it was yours.
REGGIE
You can get away with an awful lot
in life if you don't shout about it.
They enter...

THE INNER ROOM

The place is hopping. A SINGER on a small stage croons The
Look Of Love. Reggie pauses to greet a couple of flat-faced
BOXERS. As he continues with Frances, she leans in, whispers:
FRANCES
Those men look frightening.
REGGIE
No. They’re just old boxers. I let
them drink for free if they behave.
Proper East End mugs.
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN steps past, smiles at Reggie as she passes.
FRANCES
Reggie, that was Joan Collins.
REGGIE
Yeah, and Barbara Windsor was in
here last night.
Really?

FRANCES

REGGIE
That’s my formula. Mix celebrities
with a villain or two. The punters
love it. It’s really good for
business.
They stop at a table with a great view of the stage.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Would you like a seat?
Frances smiles as he pulls out her chair. But as she sits -RONNIE HART
(stepping up)
‘Scuse me, Reg. Have you got a
moment?
REGGIE
No, I haven’t.
The barman passes Reggie the drinks. Wincing, Hart presses.
RONNIE HART
It’s important.
Something about the way Hart says it. Reggie can’t ignore
him. He smiles at Frances.

Final Shooting Draft

14.

REGGIE
Frances, would you mind if I take
care of some business for a moment?
FRANCES
No, of course not.
Reggie follows as Ronnie Hart leads the way. MOVE WITH him
and an annoyed Reggie around the corner, down a hall into...
25

THE BACK BAR

25

Where a nervous, shambling JACK ‘the Hat’ MCVITIE sits in a
booth with Donoghue. He grimaces a smile when he sees Reggie.
MCVITIE
How are you, Reg?
REGGIE
No complaints, Jack. But who’d
listen anyway? What’s the palaver?
Reggie sits. Jack wedged between him and Donoghue with Hart
standing by.
DONOGHUE
You had a question about the take on
the Purple Heart business. The pill
game. Jack here would like to
explain.
McVitie gulps, trying to appear cool.
MCVITIE
Well, Reg, I, um, the thing is,
under normal circumstances, I -REGGIE
For Chrissakes get on with it. I’ve
got things to do.
MCVITIE
I borrowed a few quid off the top.
Sold a few pills on the side. Things
have been tight at home; and I got
carried away trying to keep the wife
happy.
Exasperated, Reggie looks from Hart to Donoghue.
REGGIE
You brought me in here for this?

Final Shooting Draft

15.

DONOGHUE
You should know about this.
Reggie disgusted with McVitie, looks him over.
REGGIE
You be at work tomorrow. You pay
back every penny. Understood?
MCVITIE
Yes. Of course.
McVitie hoping he’s in the clear as Reggie takes out a pack
of cigarettes, expertly taps one out which he takes with his
mouth. He looks to McVitie, sighs.
Cigarette?

REGGIE

McVitie nods. Reggie taps out another, holds it face level.
As McVitie leans forward, opens his mouth to take it -WHALLOP! Reggie arcs a right hook into his jaw, breaking it.
McVitie down in a heap. Reggie looms over him.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
I’ve marked your card, Jack. Next
time I'll finish you off.
McVitie moans, manages a nod.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got
better things to do tonight.
Reggie goes. Donoghue catches up with him.
DONOGHUE
There’s something else.
Reggie stops short, cuts him off.
REGGIE
I’m on a night out, Albert. I’ve got
a young lady with me and I’m
entertaining.
(points through door)
There. Do you see that?
I see.

DONOGHUE

REGGIE
It can wait until tomorrow.

Donoghue gives up. WE FOLLOW Reggie back out as he brushes
off his suit, leaving the ugly encounter behind, returning to
his charming self as...

FRANCES

Reggie joins her, like nothing just happened.
REGGIE
Did I miss anything?
Just me.

FRANCES

REGGIE
That’s a lot to miss.
Is it?

FRANCES

REGGIE
Yeah. Your brother was telling me
you’re studying to be a secretary.
FRANCES
Anything to get out of the East End.
REGGIE
What’s wrong with the East End?
FRANCES
I’ve got bigger dreams than pushing
a pram or haggling with the butcher.
I just don’t know what they are yet.
REGGIE
The East End’s not so bad. The
center of the world can be anywhere
you like.
FRANCES
Even here? In Bethnal Green?
Reggie nods, looks her over, likes what he sees.
FRANCES (CONT’D)
Do you like being a gangster?
That stops him short. He gathers, answers...
REGGIE
I’m a club owner.

Final Shooting Draft

17.

She waits for more. And something about her, brings out a bit
of truth.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
I like the money and the respect, of
being a club owner.
She smiles at the euphemism.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
I could’ve been a boxer, but I
might’ve ended up punchy, not
knowing who I was, instead of
knowing it for sure.
(a beat)
Mostly I like the fact that I’ve
made a little something of myself. I
don’t owe the world a thing.
FRANCES
So long as the world agrees with
you.
He looks at her a long beat. And finally Frances leans in and
KISSES him.

A CARAVAN ahead, nestled in a hollow. As we MOVE IN on it
Churchill’s voice is coming from inside.
CHURCHILL’S VOICE (CONT’D)
We shall fight in the fields and in
the streets. We shall fight in the

The door opens. There’s Ron, slightly disheveled, but trying
not to look it. He smiles up as Reggie leads her over.
RON
Hullo, Frances. Welcome to the
family.
He looks to Reggie who’s a bit embarrassed at the thought.
RON (CONT’D)
I mean, maybe one day.
Reggie gestures toward the caravan.
REGGIE
Have you got a bottle of beer in
there?
(Ron nods)
I’ll let you two get to know each
other.
As Reggie heads inside, Ron looks to Frances.
RON
You want a cup of tea?
He leads her to where a kettle sits on a grate over a fire.
RON (CONT’D)
(re: Reggie)
So, do you think we look alike?
Certainly.

FRANCES

RON
No, you think Reggie is beautiful
and I’m not.
As Frances tries to figure out how to answer...
REGGIE’S VOICE

Unload the car! Be useful!
A lithe young man bounds out, smiles fraternally at Frances
as he heads off for the Lincoln. This is ‘MAD’ TEDDY SMITH.
Ron watches after him, turns back to Frances.
RON
I’m a homosexual, Frances.

Eddie belts him. McLean refocuses from the blow.
CHARLIE RICHARDON
Your honor. By saying your honor you

CHARLIE RICHARDON (CONT’D)
You’re in Indian Country, old son.
That’s what you Cockneys call south

Cornell eases off the juice. McLean sags...
CHARLIE RICHARDON (CONT’D)
You’re scared of the wrong outfit.

You’ve fallen foul of the Cherokee.

Suddenly the wall explodes as a BOX VAN crashes through.
Eddie and Charlie are lost in a storm of debris. Finally, all
we hear is an ENGINE RACING.
Eddie emerges, looks in the empty van to see the gas pedal is
wedged down. Charlie shake off some dust, lets loose a HOWL

REGGIE
No. Let ‘em through.
They do so, following them closely. Cornell to Reggie:
CORNELL
Things’ve gone far enough. Charlie
wants a meet. The Pig & Whistle.
Neutral ground, just him, Eddie and
you two.
RON
And how do we know we’ll be safe?
CORNELL
Safe? Well, that’s a little thing
called trust, ain’t it?
RON
When one fella starts to talk about
trust, look over your shoulder and
you’ll see another getting ready to
shove his cock right up your ass.
CORNELL
Well, you wouldn’t mind that, would
you, you fat poof?
Ron draws a GUN. Reggie grabs his arm.
REGGIE
No, Ron, not here.

An hour it is. Now shove off!
Cornell offers one last leer at Ron before he and Jobber

A DOZEN CUSTOMERS. Reggie and Ron enter, looking about. They
head to the bar. Reggie holds up two fingers to the BARMAN.
REGGIE
Two Guinness.
BARMAN
Half a minute. Gotta go down and
change the barrel.
Obviously rattled, he disappears down the hole in the floor
to the cellar. As he pulls the trap door down over his head --- Four customers scurry out. The other EIGHT are RICHARDSON
GANGSTERS. Approaching from all sides. Tough bastards. Tooled
up with coshes and pipes. One, Mike Jobber, holds a razor.
MIKE JOBBER
Reg, Ron, the Richardsons were
unexpectedly engaged. We’re going to
look after you.
RON
(re: Jobber’s razor)
What’s that supposed to be?
MIKE JOBBER
What do you think? It’s a tool.
RON
No it’s not; it’s a fucking utensil.
What are you going to do with that,
fry me an egg?
Ron indicates some hard metal shoved down in his pockets.
Pistols? As Jobber frowns...
RON (CONT’D)
I came here for a shoot out. A
proper shoot out with some proper
men! Like Colonel Custer and
Geronimo.
(turns)
Reg, this lot are fucking nonces.
(to Jobber)
Get out of my way.
Motioning, with what seem to be guns, Ron walks past the
Richardson gang and pauses by the front door.

RON (CONT’D)
A shoot-out is a fucking shoot out!
Like a Western...
And then he’s gone. One of the gang closes the door behind
him. Jobber and the others turn back to Reggie.
MIKE JOBBER
You’re brother’s done a runner.
REGGIE
(shrugs)
You don’t mind if I pour myself a
pint, do you?
Reggie reaches over the bar, starts to POUR a GUINNESS.
Jobber trades incredulous looks with the others.
MIKE JOBBER
Charlie Richardson said we’re to
knock the granny out of you, Reg.
All the while Reggie tends to his Guinness.
REGGIE
He did? Well...
(turns)
Fuck Charlie Richardson. And his
brother. Fuck Georgie Cornell. And
Albert Woods. Fuck you, hmm? And
fuck the whole fucking lot of you.
(holds up glass)
First pour about three quarters.
Then you let it settle.
The eight close in a step. Reggie sets the glass on the bar.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Before you top it off proper. You
want the head looking proud over the
glass.
Reggie shoves his hands in his pockets, rocks on his toes
like a proud schoolboy.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
It won’t bother you cunts if I fight
back, will it?
MIKE JOBBER
If you think you can manage it.
REGGIE
It won’t exactly be by the rules.

Reggie pulls his hands out of his pockets, both fists held
tight around BRASS KNUCKLES.
LAUGHS all around. They’re not intimidated. Only Reggie sees:
RON quietly slip back into the bar from the OTHER ENTRANCE,
behind them, a HAMMER in each hand. Reggie smiles.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
You think I’m joking? Try this one
then. A paranoid schizophrenic walks
into a bar...
Ron doesn’t break stride as SWING! Blind-sides the rear man.
Jobber crumples even as Reggie wades in. And it’s one-two,
from Reggie, the brass knuckles covered in blood as he keeps
an unconscious men standing with a flurry of uppercuts.
FRANCES (V.O.)
When the Krays fought together, they

We watch the Kray Brothers obliterate eight men. They fight

DE FAYE

Mr. Payne. I’m not often intrigued,
but your message, it intrigued.
PAYNE
Please. Sit down.

As de Faye sits, he doesn’t notice the two men sitting
against the wall behind him: Ron & Reggie Kray.
PAYNE (CONT’D)
(gestures)
These are the Kray twins...
As de Faye turns, clocks them...
PAYNE (CONT’D)
...Ronald and Reginald.
DE FAYE
(nervous)
Yes, I’ve, heard of them, of you.
PAYNE
You’ll find them useful friends.
The vibe shifts on its axis as Ron blows a smoke ring,
doesn’t look over. Reggie offers a nod, goes back to checking
his fingernails. De Faye frightened now.
DE FAYE
What’s this about, Mr. Payne?
PAYNE
This is about a gambling casino in
Knightsbridge, Esmeralda’s Barn.
DE FAYE
I don’t think I’m familiar with it.
PAYNE
Then you’ll be shocked to learn you
earned 24,000 pounds from it in the
last three months. That you’re one
of four principal investors. But
that final control is vested in a
company called Hotel Organization
Ltd. Did you know that company is
you, and you alone, Mr. De Faye?
De Faye looks back at the Krays, to Payne, then finally nods.
PAYNE (CONT’D)
My friends and I wish to purchase
the casino from you. I have the
contracts ready for your signature.
De Faye looks at a DOCUMENT facing him, a PEN alongside.

FRANCES (V.O.)
Ruling London involved intelligence

DE FAYE
It’s not for sale.
Payne smiles as if humoring a poorly told joke. A beat.
PAYNE
You might find in the future there
is a less polite approach.
FRANCES (V.O.)
The trick was to cultivate a quiet
certainty that should it be needed,
violence was on offer and would be
happily applied.
De Faye laughs, tries to brass it out, but he’s very afraid.
Ron smiles at him. As Payne offers up a smile of his own...

Ron was suspicious of him, afraid
his scams were the opposite of what
a gangster should be.
Ron holed up in a corner, eyeing Payne suspiciously. Payne
looks a little too ‘proper’ for this crowd.
PAYNE
We should acquire a casino.
REGGIE
How? We’re known gangsters.
PAYNE
Consider Las Vegas. All legal, all
run by the Mafia. Soon London will
be the same. With Havana gone, the
Mafia is moving in. Meyer Lansky has
already made inquiries.

RON
Meyer Lansky... What, the Americans
are going to try to muscle in on us?
PAYNE
No, they don’t work that way. They
don’t want war. They’re businessmen.
RON
Well, maybe I want war with them.
Payne looks to Reggie, tries to explain to Ron.
PAYNE
What they do want is to know who is
the up-and-coming local firm.
They’ll colonize London by financing
that firm, then franchising the
city.
(to Reggie)
You need to prove to the Americans
the Krays are the only game in town.
RON
Interesting...
As Reggie thinks it over...
PAYNE
The world could be our oyster.
RON
Payne. You say we a lot. You also
say our a lot?
Do I?

PAYNE

RON
My question is, is your last name
Kray?
Payne can feel himself getting in over his head.
PAYNE
You take the pearls, Ron; I’m
perfectly happy with the soft bits.

BRUNO and underlings TESTA and CAPONIGRO on the other.
BRUNO
Meyer Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club. He has
his casino people there now.
RON
Mr. Lansky should know that we
happen to have a casino of our own.
BRUNO
Your own casino? Well, we own Las
Vegas.
Testa and Caponigro chuckle at that.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
But here the Atlantic Ocean is in
our way. So Mr. Lansky lacks the
ability to ensure the physical
security of his property. From both
outside muscle and the cops. He
thinks the Kray family can help.
REGGIE
You don’t want our help; you just
don’t want us getting underfoot.
Ain’t that it? How do we keep the
local yokels out of the way?
Bruno likes Reggie’s directness. He’s direct back.
BRUNO
London’s going to be the Las Vegas
of Europe. We need someone to front
and someone to muscle for us.
REGGIE
We can do your security, but we
don’t want to work for you; we want
to work with you.
PAYNE
What Reggie is trying to say --

BRUNO
I think he knows what he’s trying to
say. He just said it. We’re in your
backyard and Mr. Lansky is open to
discussions of this nature.
(points at briefcase)
He sends this as a good will
gesture. Just a taste.
Reggie opens briefcase one. It is filled with $100 BILLS.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
For expenses. Now the second
briefcase contains business of my
own I need to take care of.
Payne opens this one: It contains banded stacks of...
BRUNO (CONT’D)
One hundred grand in negotiable
bearer bonds. Jacked from a bank in
Montreal. Too hot to move in North
America. Can you guys handle it?
Reggie looks at Payne. Payne gives the slightest nod back.
REGGIE
Yeah, we can handle it.
BRUNO
Boys who jacked it get twenty
percent. We split the rest
sixty/forty. This works out, Reggie,
I got a two million dollar backlog
of those bad boys. Does that sound
like you’re staying out of our way?
Reggie considers Bruno. A moment of truth.

Fifty/fifty, mate.
Bruno considers him back...

is, done.

BRUNO
Come again? I didn’t get that.
RON
I prefer boys. Italian. Greek.
The room goes dead fucking quiet. As Payne looks to Reggie,
Testa looks to Caponigro, Bruno cocks his head.
RON (CONT’D)
But I’m not prejudiced. I’ve had
Negros, Scandinavians, I even had a
Tahitian once.
As the Italians swallow, try not to make the sign of the

A bar, dining room, roulette and gambling tables. TIMI YURO
sings on a stage. Whether they eat, gamble or watch the show,
there’s not an empty seat in the house. Serious money is
wagered. The croupiers look smart; the women look smarter.
FRANCES (V.O.)
Esmeralda’s Barn made money like a
dream. Two thousand pounds a week
pure profit. There was nothing to do
but enjoy it. Owning that casino
meant everything to Reggie. He had
finally crossed the line between the
old East End and the green pastures
of the Golden West.
Reggie make the rounds with Frances. They look fantastic.
FRANCES (V.O.)
He was becoming a celebrity himself.
As long as their health didn’t
suffer, the high rollers loved
rubbing elbows with gangsters.
A FLASH of Reggie at a table with JUDY GARLAND. A FLASH of
Reggie posing with SONNY LISTON. FLASH - SHIRLEY BASSEY. Joan
Collins. Reggie with LORDS and LUCIEN FREUD. They watch
Frances bet RED at the roulette table. As it comes up RED...
FRANCES (V.O.)
Aristocrats and criminals have a lot
in common: they’re both selfish, get
bored easily and have access to wads
of cash they didn’t have to work
honestly to get. The topper? Neither
have any interest in bourgeois rules
or morality. Put it all together
with roulette wheels? A stunning
recipe for success.
On stage Timi Yuro seems to sing to Reggie.
TIMI YURO
Oh, look around you, look down the
block from you, the lonely faces
that you see. Are you sure this is
where you want to be?

RON sits at the bar looking gloomy, watching his brother with
an undeniable envy. And his look to Frances is disquieting.
FRANCES (V.O.)
Ron was the odd man out. His pills
stabilized him, but they’d never
cure him. Clubland on its own held
little charm and he yearned for
Reggie and the darker side of
gangland.
As RON downs his drinks, he speaks to ‘Mad’ Teddy Smith.
RON
In the early days me and Reg were
undesirable, but still we fancied
ourselves. The moment you fucking
look away life plays a dirty trick.
REGGIE
And as Reggie listens and laughs with those around him,
Albert Donoghue enters and leans in behind Reggie. Whatever
he WHISPERS in Reggie’s ear is not good news.
Reggie grinds out his cigarette, looks across at Frances
who’s chatting up an older WELL-TO-DO COUPLE. Feeling his
eyes on her, she looks over. He smiles like nothing’s wrong.
But something is wrong.
FRANCES (V.O.)
We wouldn’t spend Christmas together
that year. There was an old warrant
on Reggie. Demanding money with
menaces. The last six months of the
sentence was on appeal, but it was
denied. He was to surrender in the
morning.
Frances realizes something is wrong and it’s suddenly like
they are the only ones here. And as Timi sings...

Reggie hangs onto the Big Screw, fawns. It’s hard to watch.
REGGIE
No trouble. No trouble, guv’nor.
BIG SCREW
Yeah, that’s it. A bit of respect.
He steps back and Reggie falls to the ground. We may not
notice, but Reggie comes away with the Screw’s HANDCUFFS.
The Big Screw exits, locks the cell door. The other screws
head off. Reggie looks up from the floor, eye swollen shut.
REGGIE

BIG SCREW
Alright, son. I’ll sort it.
Reggie climbs painfully up the bars. The Big Screw returns

WHALLOP. The fist comes right between the bars. Stuns him.
Reggie reaches through, grabs him by the ears and yanks his

Several in the crowd APPLAUD him, amused. Ron smiles.

Tomorrow I might start hating the

VOICE IN THE CROWD
It’s London, Ron! The sun might not
come out tomorrow!
RON
I’ll have a cry in the rain instead.
LAUGHS at that, but only a few. Ron looks them over, snarls:
RON (CONT’D)
Look at you flash fuckers, you make
me sick. Spineless half-hearts.
Well, I may not be good, but a good
gangster? I’ll claim that title!
What title do you claim? It’s
disgusting. You’re all disgusting.
Said with venom. An uncomfortable silence descends.
RON (CONT’D)
Right, how about a bit of magic? You
may all know that there are three
C’s in the word carpaccio. But how
many C’s are in the word cunt?

He opens his palm to show candy.

They’re lemon sherbets actually.
He tosses one up. She fumbles at it, but catches it.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Well played.
She pops the lemon sherbet in her mouth.
FRANCES
Why didn’t you ring the bell?
REGGIE
I thought of your mum answering. I

REGGIE
Yes... You look beautiful.
FRANCES

climbs the drainpipe.
FRANCES
Reggie, careful.
He gets up to the window, sets one hand on the sill.
REGGIE
Get the flowers.

And your Christmas present.
She takes it from under his chin. He looks at her: Go on.
Frances unwraps it, opens it: a DIAMOND RING.

Reggie can’t bring himself to leave. He motions Frances to

I’m not playing; you are. Finally

FRANCES

Reggie looks back at her. ‘Let’s go’ in her eyes. As Ron
feels himself losing his brother...
RON
We’re talking about earning a

being gangsters which is what we
are. So fuck off.
As Reggie reacts to that, Frances stands her ground.
FRANCES
One day, Ron Kray, your miserable
life will swallow you whole.

Ron looks toward her, steps forward to insure she goes and
Reggie stays.
RON
Empty like you, Frances. Empty!
There’s nothing inside you! Nothing

Reg’s equanimity gone, he grabs Ron by the collar and
backpedals him across the room, heaving him over a table to
the floor. Ron blinks up in disbelief.
RON (CONT’D)
You threw me...
Reggie steps over to him, not done with him yet. Ron looks at
the others all watching...
No!

RON (CONT’D)

And it’s on. Frances watches as: Two brothers fight for the
end of the world.
The counter puncher in attack mode and the boy you’d have to
kill to beat doing his best to live up to that rep.
Frances grimaces as the force of it all escalates.
FRANCES (V.O.)
It was not the first time I’d been
called damaged goods. Fragile was
the word polite people used. Fragile
was fitting. Life was fragile. So
was love.
Ron pulls away. Reggie rolls up to a crouch. Feinting left,
he hooks Ron twice to the body, then grabbing him by the
shirt, drives punch after punch into his face.
FRANCES (V.O.)
But if I was damaged, they were
absolute wreckage.
Frances turns and heads out. As Big Pat finally moves forward
to stop the fight, Donoghue blocks him.

Reggie struggles, finally pulls away.
Reggie slumps, catches his breath, looks: Frances is gone. It
may as well be a death knell for the casino as well. Ron lies
there, looking crucified to the floor.
RON
You don’t understand me.
REGGIE
I don’t want to understand you!

Who else will? Who else can?
His voice raw; it stops Reggie short.

RON
What’s that mean, the only word?

PAYNE
You’re like Ford. Shell. Woolworths.
RON
Woolworths. Interesting...
PAYNE
Kray is a brand. And an established
reputation needs less maintenance.
Less violence. People fall naturally
in line. Clubs are asking for our
protection before we even offer it.
REGGIE
(confirming)
That’s true. They are.
RON
I suppose it leaves us with less
straightening out to do.
PAYNE
That’s right.
Ron going dark, considers the glass in his hand.
RON
I happen to like a good
straightener. Obliging someone on
the cobbles. What’s wrong with that?
PAYNE
I just think you could do better,
Ron. It’ll keep you all out of
prison, I mean, none of us are
getting any younger.
(turns to Reggie)
And you’ve got your lovely wife to
think about.
Wife. Without warning, Ron smashes his glass into Payne’s
face. As Payne falls to the floor, Reggie grabs Ron who tries
to get around him. Apoplectic at Payne:
RON
I’m marking your card! This is a
firm and I’m a face, understand?
It’s not fucking Woolworths!
Payne gets to his feet. Bleeding from a cut on his cheekbone.
REGGIE

REGGIE
No! What I wonder is, what you keep
up here?
Reggie pokes Ron’s forehead with his forefinger. Ron bats his
hand away, resentful of the treatment.
RON
He knows too many things about us.
REGGIE

Hey, Albert, do you know things

BRUNO (CONT’D)
In our line of work, it ain’t good
to be famous. Anonymous is the goal.
(after a beat)
It’s Mr. Lansky, Reg. He sees a lot
of potential in you, but he sees
limitations in your brother Ron.
REGGIE
Maybe he needs to get to know him
better. Come across for a chat.
BRUNO
A chat. You guys crack me up.

You heard of the Gallo Brothers?
From Brooklyn?

Similar loose cannon situation.
Ron’s your Joey. And it’s not going
to end well in either case.
REGGIE
What exactly are you asking me to
do, Mr. Bruno?
BRUNO
I’m asking you to do something about

111

SIX MEN stand against a tile wall staring ahead. One is Ron.
In the shadows across from them: Nipper Read and the Barmaid.
She scans the faces, stops at Ron, obviously recognizes him.
After a long beat, she looks at Read and shakes her head.
NIPPER
Take your time.
BARMAID
No. The man who shot Cornell is not
here.
NIPPER
Are you sure?

Champagne, tea and cake. A party for Ron. His parents,
Reggie, Donoghue, the Firm, Big Pat, all congratulate him.
Frances watches from the doorway, can’t understand it.
Reggie raises his glass in a toast.
REGGIE
You can give a dog a bad name, but
when that dog is named Kray, he just
might bite you back! Well done, Ron,
justice is served.
VIOLET
Welcome home.
Everyone toasting Ron. Frances staring at Reggie in disgust.
As he clocks her look...

EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - EAST END - DAY

113

Reggie and Frances walk home in silence. She notices ahead,
coming toward them: the Barmaid from the Blind Beggar.
The Barmaid suddenly sees Reggie, can’t hide her fear,
crosses the road to keep from passing too close. If Reggie
sees her, he doesn’t let on. Finally...
FRANCES
What did you tell her?
REGGIE
I told her she might want to think
about her children.
Frances stops short. Reggie sees the disgust in her eyes.
FRANCES
I wish I could make you go away.
As Frances turns and walks the other way...

Frances halfheartedly wipes away dust with a rag. She pauses
at RAIN patter. Realizing, she looks out the window to see
the Triumph is parked out there with the top down.
CUT TO:
115

EXT. TRIUMPH SPITFIRE (SAME)

115

The rain heavier as Frances rushes over, gets in. She reaches
over the backseat trying to get the top up. She can’t work
out how. As she and the car get soaked and the frustration
hammers home, she bangs the frame with her fist.
FRANCES
C’mon, damnit!
116

INT. FORD GALAXY 500 - LATE AFTERNOON

116

Windshield wipers work as Donoghue pulls up. Reggie drinking
straight from a BOTTLE OF GIN, leaning forward as he spots
Frances in the back of the Spitfire.
REGGIE
What’s she doing?
We look into Reggie’s eyes, something unsettling there.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
It surprises me that some people
still survive in this world.
117

EXT. TRIUMPH SPITFIRE (SAME)
Frances is desperate, yanking and banging when she spots
Reggie walking over unsteadily from the Galaxy.
REGGIE
Have you gone mad?
Help me!

FRANCES

Help you?

FRANCES
Get the top on! It’ll be ruined!
REGGIE
How can I help you? I’m a club
owner, not a mechanic. Or am I
gangster? No wait, that’s not
allowed.
FRANCES
Reggie, please.
REGGIE
(mocking)
Please, Reggie.
(a beat)
You want my help? I thought you
wanted to wish me away? Okay.
He starts to pull on the top. Violently. Tearing at it.
Making matters worse. Finally he stops, looks at her.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
It’s fucked.
(smiles)
And you look like a drowned rat.
He starts laughing and... She SLAPS him. Hard. A beat and -Frances starts walking back to the building’s entrance.
Reggie watches her go a beat, takes a swig of gin.
Then, as he follows slowly after her...

Frances takes off her dress, starts to wring it out into the

And then Reggie is there, grabbing her, driving her back

Reggie --

FRANCES

He knocks her down to the floor. Frances gasps as he grabs
her legs, flings her back.
He starts tearing loose her panties.
Stop!

Final Shooting Draft

91.

He uncinches his belt and, keeping her down with one hand
FRANCES (CONT’D)
No, Reggie, no!
And as we drift away from them, back out the door, leaving
Reggie to it. Her SCREAMS fading as...
FRANCES (V.O.)
There were three people in our
marriage and in a way it was Ron who
visited me now. Not to forgive
Reggie and I never will. As I said,
it took a lot of love to hate him
the way I do. I also knew I could
never escape him because he looked
on me as his own escape.
(a beat)
Truth is I was tied to him as well.

As she girds herself...
RON
Where do you think you’re going?
FRANCES
I’m leaving Reggie.
RON
That’s a shame. He’ll take it hard.
FRANCES
Please get out of my way, Ron. Or
would you prefer me to stay?
He motions Holt and Teddy to go on, then steps aside.
RON
Go on, boys, go on.
They continue on. As she walks toward the cab, Ron walks with
her.
RON (CONT’D)
Do you need help with your bags?

Final Shooting Draft

92.

FRANCES
No, thank you.
RON
Come on. Don’t be daft.
He takes one, carries it toward a waiting CAB.
RON (CONT’D)
To be honest I think you’re getting
out just in time.
FRANCES
Do you think so?
RON
Absolutely. So many people know so
much. Not you, of course.
He chuckles at his own joke. She looks him over as the CABBIE
takes the suitcases, adds it to the TWO others already here.
RON (CONT’D)
Some are loyal, but mostly we’re
hated. Sooner or later someone will
talk and it will all be over.
FRANCES
That wouldn’t be so bad, would it?
He looks at her, then starts to LAUGH. She smiles sadly at
the sight. Something genuine about Ron to her at this moment.
RON
Maybe God will cut us some slack.
What do you think?
FRANCES
I’m sure God will.
Frances turns away. Ron sees the bruises on the side of her
face.
RON
That’s not how we were brought up.
FRANCES
Ron, I’ve got to go.
RON
Of course. Listen, Frances, we both
loved him; we both made the effort.
I suppose we’ll just have to see
when we get there.

Final Shooting Draft

Where?

93.

FRANCES

RON
Heaven, of course.
She takes a step closer, kisses him softly on the cheek.
FRANCES
Good-bye, Ron.
She gets inside the cab. Ron takes one last look at her.
RON
I always liked you, Frances. You
have the ability to see into the
future. That’s the same as me.

Bye now.

REGGIE
Alright, Frank. Long time no see.
FRANK SHEA
Walking straight, you know?
REGGIE
Is Frances here?
(Frank reacts)
I’ve been going round your parents
for two weeks. They didn’t tell me
she’d left. Been standing under her
window like a fool.
Frank looks to the house, back to Reggie, finally nods.

FRANK SHEA
She’s here. Reggie, she’s... I
haven’t seen her like this in a long

FRANCES
I am home. Until I find someplace
else. I can’t live with my mum...
REGGIE
How can I change your mind?
FRANCES
You can’t. I have changed my mind
about one thing though.
REGGIE
What’s that?

122

Final Shooting Draft
FRANCES
I do want you to remember me.
Always. That I existed. That I once
walked beside you.
He just looks at her, tries to smile.
REGGIE
Come on now. I always thought we’d
have a child or two.
FRANCES
Why? So you could use them to
threaten me?
REGGIE
No. Because I still love you.
FRANCES
No. That’s just a thing you say out
of loyalty to something that didn’t
exist in the first place.
REGGIE
You’re wrong. Loving you is how I
hold myself together -FRANCES
(points off)
I went and watched the dog races
yesterday. It was exciting.
Reggie tries to roll with the flow of the conversation.
REGGIE
Did you win any money?
FRANCES
Didn’t bet, just watched. But the
ones I thought would win did win.
He smiles, nods, then darkens ever so slightly.
REGGIE
I got a notice. You filed to have
our marriage annulled.
Yes, I did.

FRANCES

REGGIE
Said on grounds of non-consummation.

95.

Final Shooting Draft

FRANCES
That’s right. I’m sorry if it’s
embarrassing. It’s the easiest way
to get it annulled.
He nods, understand.
REGGIE
Fair enough.
(a beat)
I’ve been concentrating on just the
clubs. For two weeks now. Since the
day -- Since you left.
Yeah?

FRANCES

Reggie nods. An Awkward moments. And then...
FRANCES (CONT’D)
You know I dreamt we could live
beyond the place we were meant for.
But you’re a gangster. And you love
being one.
REGGIE
No, Frankie, let me make amends. For
the sadness I’ve caused. The pain.
Please. Let me take you somewhere.
Somewhere?

FRANCES

REGGIE
Anywhere. Just the two of us. A
second honeymoon... Just so you can
know that I can change. That I have
changed.
She looks away, knows a lie when she hears one even if he
doesn’t.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Remember? The center of the world
can be anywhere you like.
FRANCES
(suddenly)
Ibiza.
Yeah?

REGGIE

FRANCES
Let’s go there. Ibiza. I like the

REGGIE
Yeah, you want to go to Ibiza? I’ll

FRANCES (V.O.)
God doesn’t ask if we accept this
life. There is no choice; life is
forced upon you. The only choice is
how you live it. Or not. That’s a

FRANCES (V.O.)
A cup of tea can solve anything. A
bit under the weather? Tea. You’ve
left your husband? Tea’s the answer.
As he turns right through a doorway, we continue at our own

Frances a beat before taking a little case from his pocket.
He opens it to reveal TWO RINGS: Frances’ wedding band and
engagement ring. He picks up her hand and slowly, almost
ritualistically, puts them onto her finger.
As he holds her hand, he shivers with a wrack of remorse.

Who should I say is calling?

McVitie enters, brought by Donoghue.

Hello, Ron. Teddy. What’s your

Ron looks from McVitie across to Reggie. This isn’t going to
go well. He turns with his drink, clocks Reggie stepping
over. Donoghue, meanwhile, taps out a cigarette, offers one.

No. I quit on the way down the
stairs.
Reggie stops across from him, looks dangerous.

Reggie once said the center of the
