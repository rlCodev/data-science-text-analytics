INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

1

CAROL PETERSEN (70s) wakes up to her alarm, the clock digits
showing 6:00 sharp. A golden retriever DOG is at the foot of
her bed. He lifts his head as she responds to the alarm.
Carol sits up in bed and the dog follows her movements,
turning his head, both of them moving slowly. She pets the
dog.
CAROL
Hey, Hazel. You sleep any better
last night?

EXT. WALKING PATH - DAY

Carol, looking groggy but dressed in sharp-looking jogging
clothes, walks the dog through her neighborhood. The dog is
hesitant and Carol needs to cajole the dog into motion with
each stop.
Carol’s neighbor MIKE (late 70s/early 80s) approaches,
walking his dog, and stops. The two dogs nuzzle each other
in a familiar way.
Hey you.
Hey Mike.

MIKE
CAROL

MIKE
How’s Hazel?
CAROL
Don’t know. I don’t like the looks
of him this morning. He’s been
having some rough nights. Walking
funny.
MIKE
Goddamned cancer.
CAROL
He doesn’t complain.

You’re his buddy, Carol.

We see the inside of Carol’s home, which is extremely clean
and tidy. We see some photographs in her living room: Carol

white photo, circa 1960s, singing in a folk duo.

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

16

Carol wakes up before the alarm goes off, as if she’s heard
something. The clock says 5:20. Hazel is not in bed with
her. Carol gets out of bed and goes looking for the dog,
calling for him. We stay on the empty bed.
Hazel?

CAROL (O.S.)
Hazel?

Carol sighs as she finds the dog.
CAROL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Hey, Hazel. You not feeling so
good?
17

INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY

17

Carol sits in a chair beside her dog in a euthanasia room.
Carol’s eyes are red-rimmed, exhausted. She leans over Hazel
and embraces him, stroking his fur. She takes his paw, which
is wrapped in medical tape and fitted with an IV catheter.
CAROL
I guess this is goodbye, boy, but
the hell if I know what to say.

4.
CLOSE UP on the dog’s face. The dog pants and his eyes are
glazed over.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I should say you’re going to a
better place, shouldn’t I? Nothing
but doggies.
(pauses)
Maybe you don’t wanna hear about
that. Maybe you better just wait
and see.
(she takes a deep breath)
I’m just gonna sit with you as long
as they let me.
Carol sits in silence and looks fondly at the dog. A VET
opens the door and Carol looks up. Carol knows it’s time.
17A

INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY

17A

CLOSE UP on Carol’s face as the Vet administers the
injections, which we hear but do not see. While the Vet
speaks, Carol pets Hazel.
VET
(softly)
I’m giving him the sedative now. He
may close his eyes.
(pauses)
Okay. Now he’s very relaxed.
(pauses)
I’m going to inject the
pentobarbital. This will stop his
heart.
After a long pause the Vet puts on a stethoscope and listens
for a heartbeat.
VET (CONT’D)
His heart has stopped.
(pauses)
I’m very sorry. Take as much time
as you need.
The VET leaves the room. Carol sits with Hazel.

23

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Carol pours herself a glass of white wine. She pauses, then
adds a bit more. She has a sip and takes a deep breath.
24

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

24

Carol is sitting in her living room. She has another sip of
her wine. She looks around. The house feels big and empty.
All the lights are off.
Carol hears a rustling nearby. She looks over, then stands up
and takes a few tentative steps toward the sound. At first
she sees nothing, and then sees the snout of a small animal
poking out from behind a cabinet. It stops moving at the
sound of Carol’s footsteps. Carol stares in shock, unable to
speak. The animal then comes out from the cabinet and
scuttles along the wall. It is a RAT.
Carol screams at the top of her lungs and runs out of the
living room.
25

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - DAY

25

Carol runs to the back doors and opens them, finally getting
outside. Carol, shaken by the whole incident, looks in the
door to see if she can see the rat.

6.
26

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - DAY - LATER

26

Carol, having nodded off on her outdoor couch, wakes up. She
looks over to see LLOYD (early 30s), a pool guy, standing
there with all of his pool cleaning gear. He has a pair of
headphones on. He pulls the headphones down around his neck
when he sees Carol staring at him.
LLOYD
Afternoon.
(pauses)
You okay?
Okay?

CAROL

LLOYD
You seemed...
CAROL
What? Are you saying you thought I
was dead?
LLOYD
No, not that. Sorry.
Lloyd begins unloading his gear by the pool, trying to avoid
the conversation.
CAROL
Because I’m an old person and I had
my eyes closed.
LLOYD
I was just making sure you were
okay.
CAROL
No, I’m not okay. I’m terrible.
Lloyd just stares at her, unsure of what to say next.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Who are you? It was always another
guy. Richie?
Lloyd has already moved to the edge of the pool and begun
setting up his cleaning gear.
LLOYD
Richie, uh, moved on. He had a
difference of opinion with the
owners. I’m the new guy.

7.
CAROL
Okay, clean away, new guy.
She begins to open the door to go back inside, then hesitates
and shuts it. Lloyd puts his headphones on and begins
assembling his gear to clean the pool, then pauses and
removes the headphones.
LLOYD
You don’t look that old, by the
way. I mean, I wasn’t worried
because you look old.
CAROL
(distracted)
You always gotta assume the worst.
Don’t worry about it.
Lloyd puts his headphones back on. Carol peers into the
house and then looks back at Lloyd.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Um... excuse me?
Lloyd removes his headphones.
LLOYD
What’s that?
CAROL
I’m sorry. I... Can I ask you a
favor?
27

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

27

Carol waits on pins and needles while Lloyd searches for the
rat.
CAROL
Do you see anything?
LLOYD
I... do not.
CAROL
Keep looking. Check behind the
curtains.
LLOYD
Sorry, I didn’t see it. Maybe it’s
gone.

8.
CAROL
Oh god. He’s probably going to
reappear the second you leave.
LLOYD
Maybe you should call, like, an
exterminator?
Carol gives him a look and cautiously enters the house.
CAROL
I can’t imagine where it came from.
I haven’t even seen a mouse in
years. I think my dog must’ve kept
them away. But a rat... it was
black. Like a bad omen.
LLOYD
So where’s the dog?
CAROL
(blankly)
I had to put him down today.
LLOYD
Oh. Jeez, I’m sorry.
Carol doesn’t respond.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
I should probably, uh, get back to
work.
CAROL
Yes, I’m sorry. Thank you...
(waiting for his name)
Lloyd.

LLOYD

CAROL
Lloyd. I’m Carol.
Lloyd nods and half smiles.
LLOYD
Uh... I’ll be right outside if the
rat comes back.
Carol nods and Lloyd heads out.

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY

28

Carol is reading at her dining room table with a new glass of
wine. Lloyd knocks on the door.
LLOYD

All set!
Carol smiles and waves. As Lloyd walks away she just sits
there, alone in the house.

Carol walks along the sidewalk. Mike approaches with his dog.
MIKE
You’re gonna tell me some bad news,
aren’t you. When I didn’t see you
guys yesterday...
Carol, petting his dog, nods.
Yep.

CAROL

MIKE
I’m sorry, Carol. It’s hard. You
should be thankful that you were
able to do that for him.
Carol says nothing. She isn’t choking up but she doesn’t want
to talk about it.
MIKE (CONT’D)
Carol, if you ever need anything...

10.
CAROL
Thanks Mike.

Carol and the EXTERMINATOR walk through the kitchen towards
the living room.
EXTERMINATOR
I suspect this was a black rat or
what we call a roof rat. Very
common in Southern California.
CAROL
Where do you think it came from?
EXTERMINATOR
They’re everywhere. They live in
the trees... they’re all over the
city.
Okay.

CAROL

EXTERMINATOR
You’d never seen signs of them
before? Rodent droppings, gnaw
marks on bags of pet food, anything
like that? They love dog food.

11.

No.

CAROL

EXTERMINATOR
And you haven’t seen it since
yesterday?
Carol shakes her head.
EXTERMINATOR (CONT’D)
Well, I have my doubts that the
rodent is inhabiting your house. I
checked the whole perimeter for
points of entry and I’m not seeing
any holes and there are no signs of
colonization. I’ll set a few traps
to make sure but I think what we
have here is an isolated incident.

Carol opens a garbage can lid and throws away a half-empty

12.

Hello?

CAROL

KATHERINE (O.S.)
Hi Mom. It’s Katherine.
CAROL
I saw your name on the thing... is
everything okay?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Just checking in... I heard about
Hazel, Mom.
CAROL
How on earth did you hear that?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Rona sent me an e-mail.
CAROL
Since when do you and Rona e-mail?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
We e-mail, mom. We’re friends on
Facebook. I’ve known her my whole
life.
CAROL
You never e-mail me.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
You don’t ever use the computer.
CAROL
And you e-mail Rona of all people?
How did she find out?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
She didn’t say. Mom, I’m just...
so sorry. It’s just terrible news.
What happened?
CAROL
When I got up yesterday he was
just... he couldn’t walk. I carried
him to the car myself. They said
the cancer had spread everywhere.
His spine. You could tell...
looking at his eyes... it was time.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
You didn’t ask for help?

13.

Why.

CAROL
What for?

KATHERINE (O.S.)
Should you even be carrying things
like that...? Heavy things...
CAROL
He was a dog, Kath. Not a thing.
And it was five in the morning.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
I just thought you had a weight
limit, after the back injury, when
was that... didn’t you have
surgery?
CAROL
No, I didn’t have surgery.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
You didn’t? I thought - your back CAROL
I see a chiropractor. I also play
golf, I swim, I carry my own
groceries. I clean this house. I...
Not that you’d know, anyway. When
were you last here? Right after
9/11 I think it was?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
I’ve been there since then.
CAROL
No, no... I think that was the last
time. You couldn’t stand the smell
or something and so you came out
here.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Mom. I came down there to be with
you. It was like going through what
happened with Dad all over again CAROL
You spent two weeks watching CNN
and talking to your boyfriend on
your cell phone and never the left
the house.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Everybody was that way when that
happened.

14.
CAROL
Well, that was the last time you
were here. Every other time I’ve
come out there. Did you ever even
meet Hazel?
Silence on the line.
CAROL (CONT’D)
(conciliatory)
Okay, never mind - I don’t... I
don’t mean to be... how did you put
it? “Guilt tripping” you?
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Okay. I’ve gotta go, Mom. I’m
sorry about Hazel. I hope you’re
doing okay.
CAROL
The house feels empty without him
but I’m okay. Thanks.
Okay.

KATHERINE (O.S.)
Love you.

The phone line clicks as Katherine hangs up on the other end.
Carol looks at the phone and clicks it off and sets it on the
counter. A beat later the phone rings again and she picks it
up on the first ring.
CAROL
(irritated)
What.... Yes it is....
(long pause, then quietly)
Thank you. Yes. I’ll be by later.

INT. GROCERY STORE - VITAMIN AREA - DAY

46

Carol browses the shelves, picking up bottles and lifting a
pair of reading glasses to her eyes to read the labels. The
scene has a tone of eavesdropping on Carol.
STORE CLERK
May I help you find something?

15.
CAROL
I’m not sure.
Store clerk looks at Carol patiently.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I just want to be sure I’m getting
enough of everything.
STORE CLERK
Are you taking supplements now?
CAROL
I take a multivitamin... I take
vitamin C. Calcium. I take some
things a friend gave me... kelp?
STORE CLERK
(patiently)
Do you have any health issues you
want to address?
Carol shakes her head vigorously.
CAROL
No, no, it’s not...
STORE CLERK
Okay, so let’s look at a few more
basics. Do you take any magnesium?
CAROL
I’m not sure.
STORE CLERK
Magnesium is a very good antiinflammatory, very good for the
smooth muscles and the joints.
It’s a good all-around anti-aging
supplement.
Store Clerk removes a bottle from the shelf and shows it to
Carol.
STORE CLERK (CONT’D)
This one is very popular.
Carol takes the bottle and looks at the clerk over her
reading glasses. While they are talking, a MAN (70s) is
standing down the aisle from them with an unlit cigar in his
mouth, listening but not looking at them.

16.
STORE CLERK (CONT’D)
What about... are you doing a
probiotic?
47

INT. GROCERY STORE - VITAMIN AREA - DAY

47

Carol continues to look around, her basket now full of
various bottles. She picks up a bottle and inspects it. The
Man with the unlit cigar comes up to her as she browses.
CIGAR MAN
(pointing at bottle)
You don’t need all that.
Carol looks up to the Man.
CIGAR MAN (CONT’D)
You’re just right the way you are.
The Cigar Man walks away and Carol just watches him go.

INT. SALLY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

53

Carol sits at a card table playing bridge with three friends,
RONA, GEORGINA, and SALLY, all in their early to mid-70s. A
hand has been dealt and the four women are holding their
cards and rearranging them in their hands.
Three of them are drinking white wine, with the exception of
Sally who is drinking a can of Budweiser.
SALLY
Rona, did you see Jerry today? At
the pool?
Jerry who?

RONA

SALLY
There’s only the one Jerry.
RONA
There’s three Jerrys!
GEORGINA
(counting on her fingers)
Jerry Davis, Gerry Phillips, and
Jerry Li.
See?

RONA

GEORGINA
Gerry Phillips is Gerry with a G,
though. Does he count?
SALLY
Do you know who he was with?
Which one?

RONA

SALLY
Jerry Davis, for Christ’s sake.
CAROL
Are we playing cards, girls?
bid, Georgina.
One spade.
Pass.

GEORGINA
RONA

Your

18.
CAROL
One no trump.
Pass.

SALLY

GEORGINA
Two no trump.
Pass.

RONA

CAROL
(thinking about it)
Three no trump.
RONA
I’m feeling good tonight, girls.
You guys are not winning tonight, I
can tell you that.
Sally laughs.
Pass.
Pass.

SALLY
GEORGINA

The girls start arranging their cards.
RONA
So who the who hell was he with?
Who?

SALLY

RONA
Jerry Davis.
SALLY
Oh right. Jerry was with Karen. And
I could’ve sworn she was doing youknow-what to him in the pool.
Sally!

GEORGINA

SALLY
Not sex, Georgie. I think she was
just giving him a little tug.
Carol and Rona laugh. Georgina is shocked.

19.
GEORGINA
The language, Sally!
SALLY
What language?
GEORGINA
(shivering)
“Tug.”
SALLY
How is that language? I said “tug.”
I didn’t say she was “jerking him
off.” Jeez...
GEORGINA
I don’t like that kinda talk.
RONA
You’re so sensitive, Georgie.
GEORGINA
I’d just rather not hear about
Jerry Davis’ habits in the pool.
RONA
That pool. It’s disgusting. Too
many people are in that pool.
SALLY
I love that pool.
RONA
God knows what’s in that pool.
CAROL
It doesn’t seem particularly clean.
SALLY
Like your pool’s a day spa.
CAROL
I have it cleaned once a week.
GEORGINA
Carol, when are you gonna move in
here? A lady just passed on two
cottages over. God rest her soul.
RONA
That reminds me - they have new
brochures. I want you to see the
new brochures, Carol.

20.
CAROL
I don’t want to see the new
brochures. I already saw the old
brochures.
RONA
I’ll bring some by this week.
SALLY
Yeah, Carol. You’re missing out on
all the action.
CAROL
I’m very happy with my house, thank
you.
RONA
But that pool, Carol.
CAROL
What about my pool?
RONA
You’re all alone there! You could
slip and fall and no one would be
around to help you. You could drown
in that pool.
CAROL
Well, at least it’d be clean.
The girls laugh. Some card playing.
GEORGINA
Carol, how’s Hazel been feeling
lately?
Carol looks at her.
CAROL
Hazel... He, uh...
(looks at Rona, then looks
down at her cards)
I had to put Hazel down.
All at once GEORGINA and SALLY put their cards down and utter
hushed apologies, “Oh, Carol,” “For Christ’s sake, why didn’t
you tell us,” etc.
When?

GEORGINA

CAROL
A couple days ago.

21.
RONA
That’s terrible, Carol.
CAROL
(to Rona)
Don’t act so surprised.
RONA
What are you talking about?
CAROL
Don’t play dumb, Rona. Kath told me
you told her. How’d you find out
anyway?
RONA
Mike told me.
SALLY
The guy with the dog? Your
neighbor?
CAROL
(to Rona)
Well, aren’t you just cozy with
everyone?
Rona is hurt by this. Sally sees it and jumps in.
SALLY
She’s just upset, Rona.
RONA
Of course she is. We all loved
Hazel, Carol.
GEORGINA
(to Carol)
How are you holding up?
CAROL
I’m fine. I’m sorry, Ro.
SALLY
To hell with the card game. We
should get good and drunk tonight.
(standing)
I’m getting another. And I got some
of that medical marijuana...
GEORGINA
(to Carol)
What are you going to do?

22.
CAROL
What do you mean?
GEORGINA
I don’t know... are you getting
another dog?
SALLY
She’s in mourning, Georgina. You
can’t just get a new dog right
after. It’s not like her car died.
RONA
I couldn’t get another dog after my
last one passed. It’s just too hard
to replace them.
GEORGINA
I just know you loved that boy so
much.
Carol doesn’t respond.

The ladies look at each other.

GEORGINA (CONT’D)
We should do something. We should
have a memorial or something. I can
talk to my pastor.
SALLY
Or maybe we can treat you to a nice
dinner out someplace.
CAROL
Look... there’s nothing left to do.
He had a good life. Even the cancer
didn’t bother him. So I don’t let
it bother me either. I’m fine.
Really. I’m gonna play some golf,
do our bridge game on Wednesdays,
try to live a bit longer, and God
willing I don’t get the big A...
(shrugs)
...and maybe someday I’ll get
another dog.
SALLY
Just a dog?
CAROL
Don’t start with that.
What?

SALLY

23.
CAROL
The dating talk. The second husband
talk. You couldn’t pay me.
SALLY
But they do pay you.
die.

When they

RONA
Not always.
SALLY
And who’s saying husband?
GEORGINA
Maybe you could date somebody.
CAROL
Maybe I could stick a fork in my
eye.
RONA
(to Georgina)
Like you’ve dated since Gary
passed.
GEORGINA
Once you’ve had the best, who cares
about the rest.
SALLY
Yeah, Rona. Not once you’ve had the
best you go out and get another one
and then another one and another
one...
RONA
I’ve only been married three times!
SALLY
Yeah, only three.
CAROL
I’m with Georgina. I’m not
interested and that’s that.
SALLY
Jeez, Carol, come on. Don’t you
ever think about it? Just somebody
to go out with once in a while...
What about Mike?
CAROL
What about him?

24.
SALLY
He’s cute. Seems like a nice guy.
RONA
I don’t know. Isn’t Mike a
little...old?

I’m not... I’m not interested in
anyone right now...
GEORGINA
You’re in that big house. All
alone. We worry about you.
I’m fine.

CAROL

SALLY
Guys ask about you all the time,
Carol. You’re a beautiful woman! I
can hook you up. I know everyone
here.
CAROL
Like it’s that simple.

What?

If it were

SALLY
You mean you gotta put out?

GEORGINA
(shivering again)
Like with Jerry in the pool.
RONA
That’s not what she means.
CAROL
I just mean I don’t like my life
all complicated. Hazel’s gone, but
I like my life the way it is. It’s
easy. I know where everything is.
Carol looks at everyone.

Everyone is looking at her.

CAROL (CONT’D)
Never mind. Are we playing cards,
girls? Let’s play some cards.

CLOSE ON: a ball on a tee. A club hits the ball.
Carol watches her shot as it drives down the fairway. She
clearly knows what she’s doing with a golf club.
Sally is watching as well.
SALLY
What a shot, Carol! Wow.
56

EXT. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY GOLF COURSE - DAY
Sally puts and misses. Carol stands on the green nearby.
SALLY
(after missing shot)
Let’s just have the maximum shot
count be ten, for Christ’s sake.
CAROL
The shot count is however many
strokes it took you to get the ball
in the hole.
SALLY
(walking to her ball)
Golf talk is so sexual-sounding
isn’t it? Balls, holes, strokes...
CAROL
Just count up your shots, Sally.
And be honest.
SALLY
What is this, the PGA?
CAROL
Yeah, the senior-senior tour.
Sally laughs and puts again. She sinks the put.
SALLY
That means I scored a thirteen on
this one...
CAROL
Oh fine. Max score can be ten.
SALLY
That’s my girl.

INT. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY CLUBHOUSE - DAY

A bunch of elderly people are sitting around having drinks
and enjoying themselves.
Sally is at a table with Carol after their game.
SALLY
You want a drink?
CAROL
It’s early. And I’m driving.
SALLY
I didn’t hear a no.
A WAITRESS approaches.
SALLY (CONT’D)
A Bud and a glass of chardonnay for
this one. Thanks, dear.
As Sally orders, Carol looks out the window to see the CIGAR
MAN from the vitamin store talking to a few gentlemen at a
table on the patio. He still has an unlit cigar in his mouth
and seems to be in charge of the conversation.
After the Waitress leaves Sally turns around and spots what
Carol is looking at.
SALLY (CONT’D)
He’s handsome.
What?
That guy.
Which one?

CAROL
SALLY

The Cigar Man laughs and has a sip of his whiskey.
looks at Carol as if to say, “You know which one.”
CAROL (CONT’D)
I’ve seen him before. He talked to
me at the store the other day.
SALLY
Really? He talked to you.
Yeah...

CAROL

Sally

27.
SALLY
What did he say?
CAROL
Something about I’m just fine the
way I am...
SALLY
Are you kidding me?
CAROL
I don’t remember.
SALLY
Oh my god. He’s sexy, Carol. He
must be new. I can find out.
Sally stands to head over and Carol stops her, making her sit
back down.
CAROL
Don’t go over there.
SALLY
Look at you, like a nervous
schoolgirl. What are you afraid of?
Carol just makes a disapproving face.
SALLY (CONT’D)
Why don’t you come with me tomorrow
night to this speed dating thing CAROL
I’m not doing that.
SALLY
C’mon, Carol. They do it right
inside the clubhouse. It’ll be good
for you. It’s fun.
I’ll bet.

CAROL

SALLY
You meet some fellas, you talk a
little. It’s not even dating.
It’s just socializing. It’s no big
deal.
(pointing to the Cigar
Man)
Maybe he’ll be there.

Carol looks up to see the Cigar Man looking at her. They lock
eyes for a moment and then the Waitress comes with drinks.
Carol looks away.

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - DAY

Carol has a glass of wine by her pool. It’s clear that she’s
had a few since her date with Sally. She notices something at
her pool and heads over. She looks in the pool and sees that
the automatic cleaning device is not moving. She makes a
face.

The cleaning device is back in the pool, roving around.

LLOYD

CAROL
Thank you. What was the problem?
LLOYD
Um... They tend not to work so well
when they come unplugged.
Carol shakes her head, knowing how silly the problem was.
Ah...

CAROL

LLOYD
You mind if I use your bathroom?
61

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Lloyd comes out of the bathroom and sees Carol’s pictures. He
focuses on the one of her in a folk band. He looks more
closely to see a YOUNG CAROL with a HANDSOME MAN in a black
and white photo from the sixties. They have instruments in
their hands.

29.
CAROL (O.S.)
Long time ago.
Lloyd looks up to see Carol staring at the photo with him.
Oh, sorry.
It’s fine.

LLOYD
CAROL

LLOYD
You were a musician?
Carol nods her head.
CAROL
I was in a folk duo. That was in
New York, a million years ago. We
used to play in the Village. I
sang.
LLOYD
That your husband?
CLOSE ON: The photo and the handsome man with his arm around
Young Carol. Their pose and look of contentment suggest that
they are together.
CAROL
No. That’s John.
Oh.

LLOYD

CAROL
My husband came later. Bill.
Carol indicates another photo, the one we saw earlier of
Carol and an older man, their arms around each other,
smiling.
LLOYD
I used to be in a band...
Oh?

CAROL

LLOYD
I sang, too. If you can call it
that.
CAROL
Where were you in a band?

30.
LLOYD
Austin. I just moved back here,
so...
CAROL
What brought you back?
LLOYD
I grew up in the Valley. Austin
didn’t work out.
CAROL
(knowingly)
I’m sure you’re better off without
her.
LLOYD
Right now it feels like it’s the
other way around.
(smiling)
You’re pretty smart for an old
lady.
CAROL
You have family here?
LLOYD
Yeah. I’m staying with my mom.
Carol looks at him as if reassessing him while trying not to
appear to be doing so. He’s a little old to be living back at
home.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Temporarily.
Friends?

CAROL

LLOYD
Not really. Not anymore, no.
CAROL
You want a drink? I was about to
open a bottle of wine. Well,
another bottle.
LLOYD
I’m still on the clock.
CAROL
Oh come on. My dog just died.
Pretend to have a drink with me.

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY
Carol pops open a bottle and begins pouring Lloyd a glass.
CAROL
You want just a little or you want
the full treatment?
LLOYD
Fill ‘er up.
She does the same for herself and lifts her glass.
CAROL
Cheers, Lloyd.
Cheers.

LLOYD

They touch glasses and have a sip. Lloyd shakes his head,
enjoying the wine.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
This is really good.
CAROL
I think so, too. So what kind of
music do you sing?
LLOYD
The closest I get to singing
anymore is karaoke night at the
bar.
Huh.

CAROL

LLOYD
But lately I’ve been writing some
songs.
CAROL
So you’re a songwriter?
LLOYD
No... but I studied poetry in
college. This is sort of the same
thing.
CAROL
You mean you went to school to
write poetry?

62

32.
LLOYD
Yeah. B.F.A.
CAROL
Bet your parents loved you for
that.
LLOYD
Yeah. Hence the pool guy getup.
CAROL
No one’s hiring poets, huh?
LLOYD
Not currently. Not for like the
past ten years.
Lloyd smiles. There’s an awkward silence.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
But someday I’ll have a lot of good
poems about... pools.
Carol laughs.
CAROL
I bet you will.
LLOYD
But it seems like - I mean, you
were in a real group.
CAROL
For a bit, yeah. That gentleman in
the picture played guitar.
LLOYD
The one who’s not your husband.
CAROL
Right. John.
LLOYD
John was pretty handsome.
CAROL
He certainly had a way about him...
LLOYD
You divorced, or?
CAROL
My husband? He died.

33.
They each have another sip of wine.
63

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - EVENING

63

Time has passed and another bottle has been opened. Carol and
Lloyd are both a bit tipsy. They share a big laugh.
CAROL
Well, I guess they set it up so you
meet a new person every few minutes
or something. It sounds awful.
LLOYD
Well, it’s an experience, right?
CAROL
I don’t know.
LLOYD
It might be fun. Why not?
Carol thinks it over and has another sip of wine.
CAROL
(to herself, tipsy)
Yeah, why not...
Lloyd smiles at Carol.
LLOYD
(checking his phone)
I gotta run. Got to meet my mom for
dinner.
CAROL
Oh sure. Sorry I kept you.
LLOYD
Are you kidding? I had a great
time. You’re a good drinking buddy.
CAROL
You’re sweet to say that.
LLOYD
(going to gather his gear)
I’m not just saying it.
Carol smiles while Lloyd goes to gather his gear. As he’s
getting it together he looks back at Carol.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Hey, what happened to that rat?

34.
CAROL
It... left. I think. The guy says
it was an “isolated incident.”
Whatever that means.
Lloyd nods. There is some silence between them.
LLOYD
You know, do you wanna... hang out
some time?
Carol looks at Lloyd.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Not like that. I mean...
Lloyd gestures helplessly.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Like this. But not here.
we should go out.

I mean

Carol raises her eyebrows.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Not... not... go out. I just mean,
if you’re interested, maybe we
could go do karaoke or something?
I’d love to see you get up there
and knock ‘em dead.
Carol laughs.
We’ll see.

CAROL

LLOYD
Okay. Cool.
Lloyd heads out. Carol sits for a beat and then finishes her
wine by the pool.

CLOSE ON: A paper flyer that says “Speed Dating - This Way”
with an arrow. Carol and Sally enter the common room.
Several women are sitting on one side of a long table with
pitchers of iced tea and drink glasses filled. A few other
women are standing up and talking. The other side of the
table is empty.
CAROL
There are no men here.

35.
SALLY
They’ll be here. Trust me.
CAROL
I can’t believe I agreed to this.
SALLY
Hey, you called me.
CAROL
I was drunk. My decision-making
skills were at an extreme low.
The woman who runs the speed dating is LESLIE HANSEN (60s).
Leslie taps a spoon on a glass.
LESLIE
Welcome everyone. Welcome. Let’s
settle in.
The few women still standing find their seats. Carol and
Sally end up seated remotely from each other. As Leslie
talks we see the women watching her and listening, but Carol
is watching the other women, looking around nervously. Carol
seems to already regret her decision.
LESLIE (CONT’D)
I see some familiar faces, some new
faces... this is going to be really
fun.
(points)
The “boys” are waiting in the next
room, and in a just a minute we’ll
open the door and they’re going to
come in... and we’ll begin.
Carol leans back and looks to Sally, who is down the table.
Sally leans back to look at her.
CAROL
(to Sally)
They’re gonna unleash them on us
like the bulls in Pamplona?
LESLIE
Each “date” is five minutes long,
and then we shift down the table to
the next date. When I tap the spoon
(taps spoon on glass)
- that’s your thirty-second warning
that it’s time for the men to shift
to the next chair.

LESLIE (CONT'D)
That’s when you want to start
thinking about exchanging
information, if that’s something
you want to do. Okay? Are we ready?
No one answers. The women just look around.
LESLIE (CONT’D)
Oh come on! We can’t do better than
that? Are you ready?
A few audible “Yeah’s” and “Yes’s” are heard.

A woman picks

LESLIE (CONT’D)
That’s more like it!
The door is opened and a dozen older men come streaming out
into the room and sit down at the table across from the
ladies. The Cigar Man is not among them. Carol gives Sally a
look that says “shoot me now.”
LESLIE (CONT’D)
(taps spoon on glass)
Let the dating begin!
The table instantly becomes a sea of chatter as the men begin
talking to the ladies.
OLD GUY 1, a bald man with a rim of white hair and a sweet
face, is seated across from Carol. His name tag says “Carl.”
OLD GUY 1
Hello. Carol, huh? That’s funny.
Carol looks puzzled.
OLD GUY 1 (CONT’D)
Carol, Carl.
Carol notices his name tag.
Ah.

CAROL

OLD GUY 1
Your first time here?
Yes.

CAROL

37.
OLD GUY 1
Same. I’ve had some girlfriends,
but I’m looking for someone, you
know, special. To go to the
movies, have a nice dinner out?
That’s a dime a dozen. But someone
who’s there for you all the time,
to go on walks every day, you know,
a companion.
Carol nods.

Awkward silence.

OLD GUY 1 (CONT’D)
So what kind of interests do you
have?
CAROL
(leaning forward)
Interests?
Yeah.

OLD GUY 1
Like...

CAROL
Like what do I like to do?
Yeah.

OLD GUY 1

Carol has to think about this for a moment.
CAROL
You mean by myself, or with other
people?
OLD GUY 1
Either one.
Carol looks bewildered.

She pours herself some iced tea.

CAROL
How about you tell me about your
interests.
Old Guy 1 looks confused. Carol grabs her glass of iced tea.
OLD GUY 1
I guess my interest right now is
you.
CAROL
I think I’m...

38.
Leslie taps her spoon on glass. Carol flinches, looking
towards her.
LESLIE
Thirty seconds! Prepare to shift!
CAROL
Jesus Christ.
Old Guy 1 looks expectantly at Carol and Carol ignores him
until the woman taps the spoon on her glass again. Old Guy 1
smiles and nods goodbye and stands, as do the rest of the
men, and shifts to the next chair.
OLD GUY 2 sits down.
OLD GUY 2
I’m gonna cut to the chase here.
Is that okay?
Carol looks at him, suddenly interested.

This guy is

OLD GUY 2 (CONT’D)
Sex is still very important to me.

The following montage is quick cuts of older men talking to
Carol as they speed date.
BEGIN MONTAGE:
OLD GUY 3
I just moved here from Florida.
It’s so cold here. The nights! So
frigid. No one told me you have to
carry a sweater around with you at
all times in California. Nothing
like the postcard!
OLD GUY 4
The most important thing is that
you’re around all of the time.
(MORE)

39.
OLD GUY 4 (CONT'D)
I’m not looking to spend the rest
of my life away from a beautiful
woman like you. I want to be around
you. All of the time.
OLD GUY 3
And it’s too cold indoors. This AC
is out of control, like what,
they’re trying to refrigerate us?
I’m telling you, you have to carry
a sweater with you wherever you go.
OLD GUY 5
Barry Manilow is coming to town and
who doesn’t love Barry Manilow.
OLD GUY 2
The other stuff is important too,
but sex is the most important. At
our age - what do we have to lose?
What am I afraid of, herpes? So I
have herpes for a few years and
then what, I’m dead anyway. I mean,
I don’t have herpes, but I don’t
care if you do. Let’s have some
fun, huh?
OLD GUY 4
If I’m with you, I want you around
me. The last woman I dated - she
was never around. She was always
going to some bridge club or a
movie, coffee with friends. I can’t
have that. Is that so much to ask?
Leslie taps her spoon on a glass.
END MONTAGE.

Carol and Sally walk away from the Community Building. Carol
is visibly dismayed while Sally is trying to appear upbeat.
SALLY
That wasn’t so bad, right?
Carol stops walking.
CAROL
Not so bad? I live a long healthy
life for this? What the hell was I
doing in there?

40.
Some other speed daters are leaving the building and cast
looks at them.
SALLY
Oh, lighten up.
CAROL
Did you talk to the herpes guy?
SALLY
One of them had herpes?
CAROL
No, he - he didn’t care if I did.
Sally gives a Carol a look.
CAROL (CONT’D)
This is upsetting.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY

Carol puts the groceries in the trunk of her car. A car
pulls up behind her, a nice luxury car. The Cigar Man is
driving and he honks the horn. This makes Carol jump and turn
around, perturbed. She recognizes Cigar Man and points at
him.
You!
Me?

CAROL
What do you want?
CIGAR MAN
I want to have lunch with you.
What’s your name?
Yes.

Your name is Yes?
CAROL
Yes, I’ll have lunch with you.
CIGAR MAN
Just like that?

CAROL
How else would you like it to be?
The Cigar Man looks at her as if thinking the question over
seriously. A car behind him honks its horn.
When?

Now.

CIGAR MAN

CAROL

Now?

CIGAR MAN

CAROL
I’m hungry.
CIGAR MAN
Won’t your groceries spoil? Just
give me your number. I’ll call you
and ask you out properly.
CAROL
You’re on your way to a date right
now. Is that it?
The HORN honks again.
CIGAR MAN
Just give me your number.
CAROL
You don’t have a pen and paper.
CIGAR MAN
Well, we seem to be in a real bind
here... I’ll remember your number.
CAROL
Oh yeah? Your brain still that

There are mostly men in the bar, drinking alone. The Karaoke

equipment.
Lloyd and Carol sit at the bar.

Have you been here before?
Lloyd shakes his head with a nervous smile.
BARTENDER
What can I get you?
Lloyd gestures at Carol as if to let her order first.
CAROL
I’ll have whatever you’re having.

Two Modelos.
Carol looks over to the guy getting the mic set up. The beers
arrive and Carol lifts the bottle.
Cheers.

Lloyd clinks bottles with her. Lloyd does not appear to be
at ease and Carol seems to pick up on this.
CAROL (CONT’D)
This is good. I needed this.

Rough day at the office?
CAROL
Not exactly that.
There is an awkward silence between them.

It’s uh... an apple-tini.
CAROL
Apple-tini. I’m gonna write that

Carol writes down “Apple-tini” on a coaster and puts it in
her purse. Carol goes back to the karaoke notebook. She nods
her head as if she’s found something.

Carol approaches the stage, picks up the microphone. She
looks tentative at first but lifts the microphone and begins
to sing. The song is “Cry Me A River” by Diana Krall.
Her voice wavers over the first few lines of the song, but by
the first chorus she is killing it, and much of the chatter
in the bar has quieted - people are locking into it. By the
last chorus, random people are whooping and clapping before
she’s even finished. When she’s finished, whistles and
cheers and generous clapping.
She returns to the bar.

CAROL
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Carol sits for a moment, then starts to get out of the car.
LLOYD
So how come you quit singing?
CAROL
I don’t remember why. I woke up one
day and I wasn’t singing anymore.
Thanks again, Lloyd.
Lloyd nods.

Carol nods in the direction of a media cabinet.

CAROL (CONT’D)
I can’t remember the last time I
put one on.
LLOYD
Let’s fucking put one on right now.
CAROL
Be my guest.
Lloyd sets down his coffee and goes to the media cabinet and
opens the doors. The cabinet is filled with LP records. In
the middle is an old hi-fi with a turntable. Carol watches
him move his index finger along the spines of the records.
He pulls out a record and turns on the hi-fi.
LLOYD
This is a beautiful turntable.
CAROL
It was Bill’s. He was very picky
about stereo equipment.
Lloyd drops the needle on a Billie Holiday record. “They
Can’t Take That Away From Me” begins playing. Lloyd listens
to the song for a bit. Carol watches him thoughtfully.
CAROL (CONT’D)
What kind of plans do you have,
Lloyd?
LLOYD
I’m not in a plan-making place.
No?

CAROL

LLOYD
More like I’m just trying to sock
some money away for now.
CAROL
You gotta be careful with that. It
might be all you end up doing.
LLOYD
Fine by me. I’ve been trying to
figure out how to do it all my
life. Hasn’t exactly worked out so
far. Is that what you did?
CAROL
Something like that.

50.
LLOYD
(heading back to where
Carol is)
So how’d you earn your money?
CAROL
I was a teacher. What they used to
call a schoolteacher.
LLOYD
What’d you teach?
CAROL
I taught all the classes nobody
else wanted to teach. Like Health.
And Typing.
LLOYD
And you saved up money and retired
on that?
CAROL
No. On Bill’s life insurance. I
retired early when he died.
LLOYD
So he died young.
CAROL
It was an accident... a plane
crash. It was a big news story for
a long time after. A lot of people
died. He was on a business trip.
LLOYD
When was that?
CAROL
Twenty years ago this spring. You
can Google it. Was one of the big
ones.
Lloyd is quiet for a moment, listening closely to the song.
LLOYD
See, now hearing that makes me want
to live in the moment. Screw the
job.
CAROL
Can’t have it both ways, huh?
I guess.

LLOYD

51.
Carol sips her coffee.
CAROL
You don't get it because you're
young. You’re looking forward to
everything.
LLOYD
I sure don’t feel like I’m looking
forward to anything.
CAROL
A break-up can do that to you.
LLOYD
Well... that happened, but I guess
really I came back because of my
mother. She’s got some health
issues... nothing serious, but I’m
here taking care of her. I’m not
even sure she likes having me
around. My dad died a few years
ago and I’m just... trying to be
responsible. Trying to do the right
thing. My other siblings are...
busy, I guess. With kids and real
jobs and hectic schedules and
travel plans.
Carol looks at Lloyd for a beat. Then:
CAROL
You are doing the right thing,
Lloyd. That’s a noble thing you’re
doing.
Lloyd shakes his head.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Just know that no matter what you
do, everything's gonna run together
by the time you're 50.
Yeah?

LLOYD

CAROL
Yeah. Just - time goes by quicker.
I don’t know, maybe if my daughter
had gotten married, if I had some
grandchildren... maybe that
would’ve slowed things down here
and there.

52.
Carol sips her coffee again and makes a face.
CAROL (CONT’D)
People talk about living in the
moment, like it’s some kind of
goal. But what does that even mean?
LLOYD
I think it just means don’t let
yourself be weighed down by what
you think you should be doing,
right?
CAROL
That’s just... impossible. There’s
no such thing as that.
LLOYD
Sure there is. You didn’t feel it
when you were singing?
Feel what?

CAROL

LLOYD
Like you were only doing that
thing. You stop being aware of
everything else. Like everything
wrong with your life just
disappears.
CAROL
But people can spend their whole
lives doing that, waiting for that
feeling, trying to find that
feeling over and over again...
LLOYD
I don’t know.
CAROL
And in the end, everybody gets it.
We wait our whole lives for
something and we get it. And you
know what it is?
Happiness?

LLOYD

CAROL
It’s death.

53.
Lloyd sips his coffee and nods, looking very serious. Carol
nods back at him, also looking serious, then bursts out
laughing.

Carol walks into the living room, where Lloyd is asleep on
the couch.
CAROL
Rise and shine.
Lloyd opens his eyes. He looks befuddled.
CAROL (CONT’D)
You fell asleep and I didn’t know
what to do. So I just left you
there.
LLOYD
That Billie probably lulled me
down.
Carol doesn’t say anything. Lloyd rubs his eyes and sits up.
CAROL
I’ll make you some coffee but then
you should go. I... I have to get
on with my day here.
Lloyd looks at her, then looks away.
Okay...

LLOYD

Carol awkwardly smiles at him and goes into the kitchen.
Lloyd looks around and starts to gather his things to head
out.
81

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - STREET - MORNING

81

Rona pulls in front of Carol’s house, behind Lloyd’s car. She
gets out, suspicious of the vehicle. As she does Lloyd come
barreling out of the house, heading for his car. He sees Rona
looking at him as he does. He stops in his tracks, unsure of
what to do.

54.

Hi.
Hi.

LLOYD
RONA

Lloyd then looks down, gets in his car and drives off. Rona
watches him go.

There’s a knock at the door and Carol answers it. It’s Rona.
CAROL
Hey. What are you doing here?
RONA
I brought the new brochures. They
have floorplans.
CAROL
(waving her in)
Ah. Right. You want some tea?
Rona comes in and Carol shuts the door.
83

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

83

The brochures sit on the counter as Carol pours some coffee.
Rona sits at the counter waiting. Carol brings the coffee.
Thanks.

RONA

Rona curls her hands around the cup.
RONA (CONT’D)
So... who was that guy?
What guy?

CAROL

RONA
The young guy with the bed head
that just pulled out of your
driveway.
CAROL
You’re such a snoop.

55.
RONA
I am not a snoop. I come over here
and I see some guy leaving your
house at eight in the morning. I’m
wondering what’s going on, is all.
CAROL
You know what, it’s none of your
business, Ro.
RONA
Okay, I know what’s going on here.
Are you some kind of cougar?
A what?

CAROL

Rona laughs.
A cougar.

RONA

CAROL
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?
RONA
I know what you’re up to. You’re a
cougar and I’m proud of you.
CAROL
Get out of here with that.
RONA
Just don’t let him videotape it,
it’ll be all over the internet.
CAROL
You would know.
Rona laughs again, but underneath it her mood is growing
serious.
RONA
You were always the one the guys
wanted. Still are, I guess.
CAROL
Ro - stop with that. Why are you
talking like that?

56.
RONA
That’s just life. Just the way it’s
always been. You get the guy.
You’re just sneaky about it.
CAROL
(looking away)
I can think of one guy I didn’t
get.
Rona looks hurt. This hasn’t been brought up in years.
RONA
You were happily married for twentysome years and you still think
about this?
Every day.

CAROL

Rona shakes her head and stands up.
RONA
I should go.
CAROL
No, Ro. It’s...
RONA
(irritated)
What?
CAROL
Look, forget it. I’ll see you for
Bridge tomorrow, yeah?
RONA
Yeah. Just... let me know what you
think of the brochures.
Rona leaves. Carol looks down at the brochures for the
retirement community, the word “ROYAL OAKS” emblazoned on the
cover.

ANSWERING MACHINE VOICE
You have two messages.
KATHERINE (O.S.)
Hey mom. It’s me. I’ve got some
frequent flyer miles so I bought a
ticket to L.A. You’re right - I
haven’t been down in a while so I
just figured I’d book it. I’ll be
in next Tuesday. Hope that’s okay.
I’ll call you later. Love you.
BEEP. Next Message.
BILL (O.S.)
I’m talking to a machine here I
guess but the machine said this was
Carol.
Carol stops drinking her water and turns to the machine,
recognizing the voice.
BILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
So Carol, this is Bill. I
remembered your number so I thought
I’d give you a call. Why don’t you
come on down to the clubhouse today
around 11.
(MORE)

58.
BILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I’ll be on the patio waiting for
you. If not - hey, no big deal.

Carol walks out onto the clubhouse patio and looks around.
There aren’t many people around but she sees Bill (Cigar Man)
sitting at a nearby table with an unlit cigar in his mouth.
He’s reading a paper. She approaches.
Hi.

CAROL

BILL
(looking up from his
paper, happy to see her)
Hi, Carol. Can I get you anything?
CAROL
I’m okay. I didn’t know how to
dress or whether to bring my
clubs...
BILL
(standing)
You’re dressed just right. I don’t
play golf.
CAROL
You live on a golf course and you
don’t play?
BILL
I’m not a fan of the game. Never
had the patience. We’re doing
something else today. My car is
right over here. You ready?

Bill leads Carol down a dock toward a boat. Bill and Carol
stop at a beautiful fishing boat. The name on the boat says
“So What.”
“So What?”

CAROL

BILL
Miles Davis.
Carol thinks for a second.
CAROL
(excited she remembers)
Kind of Blue.
BILL
You know your stuff.
Carol shrugs then looks from the boat to Bill.
BILL (CONT’D)
You don’t get seasick, do you?
91

EXT. BILL’S BOAT - DAY

The boat heads out to sea. Carol stands by Bill as he drives.
He picks up a cigar and puts it in his mouth. He looks over
to Carol and smiles. The guy is nothing but confidence.
92

EXT. BILL’S BOAT - THE PACIFIC - DAY
Bill hooks some bait onto a hook. Carol watches.
BILL
You ever fish?
CAROL
Not really.
BILL
It’s easy. You throw a line in and
wait.
CAROL
That’s it, huh?

92

60.
BILL
Usually, yeah. Good way to get to
know someone. And a good excuse to
have a few drinks.
Bill throws a line in. They have a seat and he pours her a
glass of wine and hands it to her. He plays with his cigar in
his mouth.
CAROL
You ever gonna light that thing?
BILL
I used to, all the time. Trying to
be health-conscious in my latter
years.
Oh yeah?

CAROL

BILL
Yeah. And someone once told me I
have an...oral fixation. So...
He puts the cigar back into his mouth.
CAROL
You do this for all the girls?
BILL
I don’t do this for anyone. You’re
the first one out on my boat.
Really?

CAROL

BILL
Would I lie?
CAROL
I have no idea. I’m being very
trusting of someone I don’t know.
For all I know you could be a
murderer and you brought me out
here to kill me and dump me in the
ocean. Like in the Sopranos.
Bill chuckles.
BILL
You watched that show?
CAROL
Every episode.

61.
BILL
That was a great show.
Carol smiles.
BILL (CONT’D)
I usually come out here by myself.
I just bought this boat. Took one
look at my retirement money and
just said - screw it - I’m moving
to California and I want a boat.
CAROL
Where were you living?
BILL
Different places. I was living in
Kansas City. I don’t have kids. I
got no one to leave it to. My plan
is to spend it all before I go.
CAROL
And how’s that going so far?
BILL
So far so good. People retire with
all their money and they don’t know
what to do with themselves. They
just sit. They watch TV. They golf.
They go out and eat cheap dinners.
They go to the movies. Casinos. I
didn’t want to end up like that.
CAROL
So what are you doing living with
all those people in a retirement
community?
BILL
I’m a social guy. I don’t like to
be alone.
Carol nods, taking that in.
BILL (CONT’D)
But I like this, too. I like being
out here. Being away from it all.
They look out for a while onto the Pacific. It’s serene.
BILL (CONT’D)
How about you. What are you doing
living in a retirement community?

62.

I’m not.
Not what?

CAROL
BILL

CAROL
I don’t...
(agitated)
...live there.
No?

BILL

CAROL
I have... I have a house.
BILL
So you’ve got your own place. Huh.
So how come I see you all the time
at Royal Oaks?
CAROL
I’ve got friends there. The
management lets me use the golf
course... for a fee, of course.
BILL
So why don’t you have a cell phone?
Hell, I even have one.
CAROL
I don’t like the idea of someone
always being able to find me.
(thinks more about it)
And I like coming home to messages.
It’s nice.
Carol looks out a the ocean again.
CAROL (CONT’D)
So this is fishing, huh?
BILL
This is it. They call it fishing,
not catching.

Yeah, there’s like a - you almost
seem kind of pissed Pissed?

CAROL

BILL
- yeah, but in a sad way, if that
makes any sense.
CAROL
Well, my dog died. I had to put him
down just last week.
BILL
That must have been sad for you.
That would piss me off. I’m very
sorry.
CAROL
Yes, I've been feeling like – I
guess I’m numb. I thought I would
feel... more sad. But I am sad. He
was everything in the world to me.
I can't put my finger on it.
BILL
It’s bittersweet. You can’t let
them suffer, but you don’t want to
let them go.
(pause)
It’s hard to lose somebody... no
matter how many legs they have. It
just leaves a big hole. How old was
he?
Fourteen.

CAROL

BILL
You’d been through a lot together.
CAROL
Yeah. Do you think he saw it that
way?
Carol pauses. She touches her wine glass.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Did you ever lose anyone?
or...
BILL
My wife left me.

Then she died.

CAROL
That would piss me off.
Bill smiles.

A wife,

I like you a little bit, I think.
Yeah. You’re okay.
Just okay?

CAROL

BILL
You’re not fussy.

well enough to say you’re okay.

just... spent the whole day away
from the house.
(thinks about it)
I had a great time.
BILL
Good. I’m glad.
They stare at each other for a moment. Carol, unsure of what
to do next, smiles and goes for the door.
BILL (CONT’D)
Where’re you going?
CAROL
Home. Isn’t that where I am?

Carol looks at Bill and then they kiss. It’s a nice, long
passionate kiss. Carol finally pulls away.

pushing an elderly NURSING HOME RESIDENT down the sidewalk in
a wheelchair. They make their way to an idling minivan where
another NURSE is waiting with the door open. Carol stops
walking and watches as they struggle to get the Nursing Home
Resident to her feet. She staggers into the minivan and they
buckle her inside. It is a long and strenuous process.

Maybe I’ll split a beer with
someone.

SALLY
I’m not splitting a beer with you.
Why not?

GEORGINA

SALLY
Last time you got your lipstick all
over the can and you only had one
freaking sip. You want a whole one
or not?
GEORGINA
I don’t know... can you pour me a
little in a glass?
Sally rolls her eyes. She looks over to see Carol lost in
thought.
SALLY
Carol? You want a refill?
No response.
Carol.

SALLY (CONT’D)

Carol snaps out of it and looks over to Sally.
SALLY (CONT’D)
You haven’t said a word all night.

RONA

CAROL
You don’t know, Ro.

Okay. Be like that, Carol.

Yes, let’s play. Rona, come on.

The ladies stand around trying to figure out how to smoke out
of a vaporizer. All the blinds have been closed and the lamp
is on nearby. Georgina has the tube in her hand and Sally is
trying to help her.
RONA
I haven’t smoked since the
seventies.
GEORGINA
How the heck does this thing work?
SALLY
It’s gotta warm up.
Georgina tries sucking on it.
GEORGINA
There’s nothing coming out of this
thing. It’s broken, I think.
SALLY
Be patient. It’s not warmed up yet.
GEORGINA
This is like pre-heating an oven...

70.
RONA
(to Carol)
Have you smoked recently?
CAROL
No. I can’t remember the last time.
RONA
Why am I nervous? My heart’s
beating so fast.
SALLY
Try it now. Pull slow. This thing
will mess you up.
GEORGINA
I know what I’m doing. All right,
all right, let’s get it going.
Georgina pulls on the tube, inhales and then exhales a vapor.
Rona watches.
RONA
(panicked)
Where’s the smoke? How come there’s
no smoke?
SALLY
It’s a vaporizer. I’m not trying to
smell up the whole campus!
RONA
(confused)
A vaporizer?
CAROL
Vapor, Rona!
GEORGINA
(after exhaling)
Oh man... Oh jeez... That’s great!

to her mouth.

RONA

CAROL (O.S.)
Same place I was when you asked me
two minutes ago!
GEORGINA

I knew I shouldn’t have smoked any
of this. You’ve turned me into an
advanced Alzheimer’s patient. What
is she doing in there?
SALLY
It’ll wear off. Just try to relax.
RONA
I’m feeling pretty good.
GEORGINA
There it is again!
RONA
What the hell is it?
GEORGINA
It’s like a dog barking.

Rona nods.
CAROL (CONT’D)
This ceramic owl is really staring
me down.
RONA
(quietly)
I didn’t steal John from you,
Carol.
CAROL
I never said you did. I just said RONA
That he was a guy you didn’t get?
Do you really think I had anything
to do with that? I mean, after you
quit singing... you weren’t even
together at that point.
CAROL
It’s fine. Really, Ro.

73.
RONA
It turned out to be a big mistake,
anyway. It’s not like we lived
happily ever after.
CAROL
I know that.
RONA
We never came close to what you and
Bill had. John wasn’t the husband
type. If it’s still hurting you...
It’s not.

CAROL

RONA
(pensive)
Do you think that’s what I do,
Carol? That I just go after other
women’s men?
CAROL
I’ve never judged you, Rona. You
know that. I didn’t mean anything
by it.
RONA
I’ve been married and divorced
three times, for Christ’s sake...
CAROL
Who’s keeping score anyway?
Rona smiles and Carol.
GEORGINA (O.S.)
We found it!
Georgina and Sally enter, holding a broken smoke detector.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
It was Sally’s smoke detector.
The smoke detector is in pieces.
RONA
What the hell did you do to that?
SALLY
It was yipping like a dog.

74.
GEORGINA
Dead battery. We tried to fix
it...
Georgina hands the broken smoke detector to Rona.

109A

Carol walks up to Georgina who can’t stop staring at some
food in an aisle.
CAROL
What’re you doing?

75.
GEORGINA
Look at this, Carol. Look how many
types of crackers there are.
Carol looks at the crackers with Georgina.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
Can you believe it? Every flavor
you can imagine. Gluten free...
When I was a little girl the only
cracker we had was a saltine. Now
look at it.
CAROL
It is a lot of crackers.
GEORGINA
Time moves fast. Our kids are all
grown up. I’ve got a pile a
grandkids now. But it feels good.
It feels good to know I’ve left a
mark.
CAROL
How do you mean?
GEORGINA
It just feels like I’ve done my
best. And I’m ready, you know? I’m
ready for whatever comes next.
CAROL
And what comes next?
Georgina shrugs and smiles.
GEORGINA
I’d like to think I’ll get to see
Gary again. My whole family...
CAROL
It must be comforting... knowing
that.
GEORGINA
Sometimes it is. Sometimes it
isn’t. But it’s believing not
knowing.
(pauses)
An afterlife where you get to be
with everyone again... It’s such a
cliché, isn’t it? Everything
perfect.

76.
Carol doesn’t answer.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
I was raised to believe it. I try
and choose to believe it. It is a
nice thought.
Georgina pauses to reflect.
Do you?

CAROL

Georgina looks at Carol. Her eyes and expression say “no.”
GEORGINA
Every day, it’s a choice I have to
make. Every day of my life. I have
more reasons not to believe than to
believe. They call that “testing
your faith.”
(pauses)
What about you, Carol? What do you
think?

CAROL
I don’t know.
(smiles)
I try not to think about it.
GEORGINA
Are you doing okay?
CAROL
I’m fine...
GEORGINA
I pray for you, Carol. I don’t know
if it does anything, but it makes
me happy, praying for you.
CAROL
(taking her in, realizing
it’s true)
You are happy, aren’t you?
GEORGINA
I’m blessed. And I’m blessed to
have you as a friend.
Carol looks at Georgina with a knowing look.

77.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
Now... which cracker should we get?

INT. GROCERY STORE - CHECKOUT LINE - NIGHT

The ladies try to put on a straight face as the CHECKOUT GIRL
scans their items. Fruity Pebbles, apples, a chocolate bar,
beef jerky, sour patch kids, salt and vinegar chips, milk, a
frozen pizza.
CHECKOUT GIRL
Having a... party?
The girls respond with a delayed laugh.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

112

The ladies walk with their grocery cart down the street.
Sally is pushing the cart, Georgina is eating handfuls of
cereal from the opened box of Fruity Pebbles, and Rona is
chewing on a piece of beef jerky. Carol is chugging from a
bottle of water.
GEORGINA
(pointing at the jerky)
You can eat that? How can you eat
that?
SALLY
It’s good for your gums.
As they walk a POLICE CAR pulls up to them and stops. The
police officer, OFFICER KAY shines a light on them. He steps
out of his car and approaches them.
Ladies.

OFFICER KAY

The girls stop and squint against the light and try to act
straight.
OFFICER KAY (CONT’D)
What’s going on here?
The girls look at each other. No one wants to be the one to
talk. They are still a few degrees away from realizing that
they’ve stolen the shopping cart.

78.
GEORGINA
We’ve been shopping.
OFFICER KAY
I can see that. But what are you
doing in the street?
SALLY
There’s no sidewalk. How’re we
supposed to get home?
GEORGINA
The neighborhood is not pedestrianfriendly, officer.
RONA
You can’t arrest us, for walking.
Can you...?
OFFICER KAY
People usually drive to the grocery
store.
SALLY
Well, we’ve had a few Uh-huh.

OFFICER KAY

SALLY
- so we walked RONA
- like good, responsible citizens.
SALLY
Senior citizens.
OFFICER KAY
Any of you ladies ever heard of a
designated driver?
GEORGINA
(reaching into the box of
Fruity Pebbles)
We didn’t plan that far ahead.
OFFICER KAY
(staring at Georgina for a
long beat)
Uh-huh. What about this shopping
cart?

79.
GEORGINA
What about it?
OFFICER KAY
You plan on returning that? Because
technically that’s theft. And then
we’ve got public intoxication...
RONA
Do we look like thieves to you?
OFFICER KAY
(humorlessly)
A thief doesn’t have a specific
look, ma’am. A thief is just a
person who takes something that
doesn’t belong to them.
RONA
Well, uh...
CAROL
(jumping in)
We borrowed it. Alphonse said it
was okay.
OFFICER KAY
Who’s Alphonse?
CAROL
He’s the manager.
Yeah.

SALLY

RONA
Yeah. Alphonse!
GEORGINA
We’re just a bunch of old ladies.
SALLY
We’re too old and feeble to carry
all these groceries home. You
understand.
RONA
And we’re turning off just a block
up the road, officer. We’re in the
Royal Oaks Retirement Village.
Uh-huh.

OFFICER KAY

80.
Officer Kay looks them over.
OFFICER KAY (CONT’D)
Well... just be safe and stay out
of the middle of the road now.
SALLY
Yes, officer.
Officer Kay gets back in his cruiser and drives off. The
girls react like teenagers to the whole situation - laughing
and high-fiving.
RONA
“Alphonse”? Who’s Alphonse?
CAROL
I don’t know. I just made it up.
They walk off down the street joshing and cracking jokes to
each other.
113

EXT. SALLY’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

113

Carol and Sally are sitting on the porch, exhausted, poststoned.
SALLY
I feel like I need to tune in more.
Yeah?

CAROL
To which things?

SALLY
I don’t know.
CAROL
You’re just stoned.
SALLY
No, that’s all worn off. I just
feel out of touch, you know? Like I
don’t know what’s going on with you
anymore.
CAROL
That’s because nothing’s going on
with me.
SALLY
I wouldn’t know.

81.
CAROL
Oh, come on Sally.
saying?

What are you

SALLY
Like... I feel like you don’t want
to admit how you’re feeling. You
just - you don’t share.
CAROL
When did I ever share?
SALLY
I’m just saying - nobody knows how
you’re really doing.
CAROL
I would tell you if I knew myself.
You would?

SALLY

They are quiet for a moment, staring out into the night air.
CAROL
I guess in the back of my mind I’m
starting to be convinced that I’m
an utter failure.
What? How?

SALLY

CAROL
Maybe in many ways.
SALLY
What on Earth would have convinced
you of that?
CAROL
I feel like I’ve... missed my mark.
I’ve left behind my true self.
SALLY
Left it behind when?
CAROL
Maybe about forty years ago.
SALLY
There’s no such thing as your true
self.

82.

No?

CAROL

SALLY
That’s a bunch of New Age mumbojumbo. If everybody were their true
selves... what a world of assholes
we’d be living in. We’d all be
picking food out of our teeth and
making kissy lips at each other
like orangutans.
CAROL
This is the end, Sally. We’re at
the end. And if I were to go right
now (snaps her fingers)
- like that, what’s left of me? I
mean, Bill’s been gone twenty
years. And he’s just gone. I
think of him all the time, but
besides that, some snapshots,
that’s all that’s left of him. And
when I’m gone - okay, then Kath is
still thinking of us. And when she
goes, we’re both gone. We’re all
gone. It’s like we never existed.
Sally looks at her, stupefied.
SALLY
Carol, I - I just was worried about
you, with Hazel gone, whether you
were lonely. Jesus, I didn’t Carol closes her eyes very slowly, then opens them.
CAROL
He was a dog, what more can I say?
I walked him every day Carol chokes up on “day” and breaks down crying. Sally puts
her hand on her shoulder and rubs her back, comforting her.

She goes to her purse, remembering something. She reaches in
her purse and pulls out the COASTER from the bar with Lloyd
with “Apple-tini” written on it. She looks at it fondly.

evening out. When she opens it, Bill is standing there. He
is holding a small bouquet of flowers.
CAROL
Hello, stranger. Are those for me?

Nah. I just thought I’d carry some

RONA
Hot date tonight?

Oh, Rona... Bill, this is my friend
Rona.
BILL
Pleased to meet you. Did you two
have plans?
RONA
I was just coming over to see if
Carol wanted to go for a walk, but
I see you’ve already got plans.
Rona shoots Carol a look like “not bad.”
CAROL
See you, Rona.

Yeah.

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Carol goes into the kitchen while Bill wanders around the
room, hands in pockets, looking at photographs.
CAROL (O.S.)
Would you like something to drink?
BILL
Are you having anything?
CAROL (O.S.)
I don’t know.
Carol enters.

Bill goes to her and kisses her.

CAROL (CONT’D)
What are we doing? Are we doing
something?
BILL
I think so.
CAROL
Because I’m out of practice with
this sort of thing. And don’t say
it’s just like riding a bike
because I can’t ride a bike to save
my life.
BILL
It’s just like swinging a golf
club.
CAROL
How would you know? You don’t play
golf.

121

86.
Bill kisses her again. They stop and look at each other,
caught up in the moment.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Do you need anything?
No.

BILL

CAROL
You don’t need one of those pills?
BILL
I don’t like pills.
CAROL
You don’t take any pills?
anything?

Not for

BILL
Not if I can avoid it. I don’t like
side effects.
CAROL
But you’ll be okay?
BILL
I don’t know. You want me to take
an aspirin just in case?

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

122

Carol turns on her bedside lamp to reveal Bill lying next to
her in bed. They are both breathing hard and sweaty.
CAROL
I’m not so sure about your golfing
metaphor.
BILL
No. It really is more like riding a
bike, I’d say.
CAROL
Yeah. A very... nice bike.
BILL
We should do it again.
CAROL
Not now.
(laughs)
I can’t.

87.
BILL
I just meant sometime. I’ll need
some time to recover. I hadn’t done
this for a long time myself.
CAROL
I don’t believe that.
It’s true.

BILL

They stare at the ceiling then Bill turns to her.
BILL (CONT’D)
What did your husband do?
CAROL
(distressed by the
question)
Why are you asking about my
husband?
BILL
I’m just curious. I’m just trying
to get to know more about you.
CAROL
He was a lawyer. His name was Bill,
by the way.
BILL
No kidding.
(beat)
What was he like?
Carol genuinely thinks about it.
CAROL
Nothing like you.

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY

123

Carol and Bill have bagels and coffee and orange juice at the
kitchen table; in the middle of the table, in a vase, are the
flowers Bill brought for their date. Bill’s hair is mussed;
he’s wearing his clothes from the night before, no shoes.
Carol is in a bathrobe.
CAROL
It’s supposed to be hot today. We
should go for a swim after
breakfast.

88.
Bill chews his bagel thoughtfully.
BILL
Have you ever thought about getting
remarried?
CAROL
I hope you’re speaking
theoretically here.
Maybe.

BILL

CAROL
That means you’re not speaking
theoretically.
BILL
I’m just testing the waters.
CAROL
Get out of the water. I barely know
you.
BILL
Is it too soon to ask your
thoughts? Just on remarrying, as an
idea.
CAROL
I’ve never seriously considered it.
Never?

BILL

CAROL
I've been married. We get married
and next thing, what - I'm washing
your underwear?
Doorbell rings.

Carol looks at her watch.

CAROL (CONT’D)
Who could that be? Excuse me.

Carol goes to the door and opens it. Lloyd is standing

the house with her body.
Hey.

LLOYD

89.
CAROL
Hi. Is today a pool cleaning day?
LLOYD
Actually - I quit.
CAROL

Oh.

LLOYD
I got another job Oh.

Good.

CAROL

LLOYD
- but I wanted to stop by and let
you know I wouldn’t be cleaning
your pool anymore.
Okay.

CAROL

LLOYD
The owner and I had differences. Or
actually, we were in complete
agreement that I should not be
working there anymore.
I see.

CAROL

LLOYD
I’d already been looking around for
something, and an opening came up,
so it worked out well.
CAROL
What kind of job did you get?
LLOYD
Pool cleaner. Another outfit. Pools
By Us.
CAROL
Pool By Us?
LLOYD
With the economy what it is - it’s
not like I’m changing careers, you
know? I’ve got skills.
They say nothing for a beat.

90.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
(meekly)
Listen - are we good?
CAROL
Of course we are.
Lloyd nods.

Bill appears behind Carol.

CAROL (CONT’D)
Oh - Bill, this is Lloyd.
Bill and Lloyd shake hands.

They both appear very confused.

CAROL (CONT’D)
Lloyd, um, is the pool guy.
BILL
Pool guy? Oh.
LLOYD
Actually I was just telling Carol
that I’m no longer going to be
cleaning her pool anymore. I’m
moving on to... other pools.
BILL
I see. Well, do you want to join us
for lunch?
LLOYD
Oh, no. Thanks, though.
BILL
Okay.
(pauses, unsure what to
make of Lloyd)
Nice to meet you.
You too.

LLOYD

Bill walks off. Carol looks at Lloyd and they smile at each
other.
Okay...
Yeah.

LLOYD (CONT’D)

Lloyd nods and looks around then back at Carol.

LLOYD
Bye, Carol.

BILL
So when can I see you again?
CAROL
My daughter is coming into town
tomorrow. I need to spend some time
with her and...
BILL
Your daughter.
CAROL
Jesus, did I not tell you I had a
daughter?
BILL
No. Though I never asked.
CAROL
I have a daughter. Her name is
Kath. Katherine.
BILL
Katherine. I’d like to meet her
sometime.
Carol rubs her eyes.
CAROL
I’ll think about it.
Okay.

BILL

CAROL
I’m sorry. This is all a little new
for me.
BILL
I understand.
Yeah?
Bill nods.

CAROL

Katherine. Katherine takes a sip of water and watches her.
They sit for a long time not talking.
Mom.
Yes?

KATHERINE
CAROL

KATHERINE
Are we going to talk at all on this
visit, or will it mostly just be us
sitting quietly like this?
CAROL
Do you want a glass of wine? I want
a glass of wine.
KATHERINE
You go ahead.
Carol starts looking for the waitress.

93.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
How are you doing, mom?
I’m fine.

CAROL

KATHERINE
I mean, really.
CAROL
Really. I’m fine.
KATHERINE
You seem a little... I don’t know.
What?

CAROL

KATHERINE
Different, I guess. Is it Hazel?
Carol waves her off.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
You always call me back and you
didn’t call me back until
yesterday. I was about to cancel my
ticket.
CAROL
I’m sorry. I was just busy.
KATHERINE
With what? You’re never busy.
Carol rolls her eyes.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I don’t mean it in a bad way, mom.
It’s just... you’ve never seemed
particularly busy. I think that’s
pretty fair to say.
CAROL
I have a life, sweetie. Hard as it
is for you to imagine, I have a
life.
KATHERINE
I think that’s great, mom. I was
just curious.
Silence takes over as Katherine goes back to her salad and
Carol starts to look around for a waitress.

94.
CAROL
Where is that waitress?
Carol looks back at Katherine.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I’m seeing somebody.
KATHERINE
Are you serious?
CAROL
Yeah. I mean... I don’t know if
it’s serious, but...
KATHERINE
I can’t believe it. Is this the
first time in... since Dad? Twenty
years?
Carol doesn’t answer.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I could tell something was
different. It’s in your eyes.
You’re not preoccupied with just...
yourself.
CAROL
(irritated)
Thanks.
KATHERINE
Well, you usually are.
you are.

You know

CAROL
I’m preoccupied, believe me.
KATHERINE
So what’s he like? What’s his
name?
CAROL
His name... is Bill.
Really?

KATHERINE

CAROL
I didn’t plan it that way.

KATHERINE
How’d you guys meet? On the
internet or something?
CAROL
Are you kidding? I just met him,
around. At the grocery store. He
asked me out.
KATHERINE
The old-fashioned way.
Yeah.

CAROL

KATHERINE
He’s a lucky guy. You’re a catch.
Carol shrugs and looks around.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
So do you like him? How long has
this been going on?
CAROL
A couple of dates.
(thinking about it)
Yeah, I like him. He’s... I don’t
know. I don’t know what the hell
I’m doing. It’s all very new.
KATHERINE
Yeah, you like him.
CAROL
Maybe.
(changing the subject)
So what’s new with you. You
getting any work?
KATHERINE
Well... I’ve got a lead on a
teaching job, actually.
CAROL
(surprised)
Really?
KATHERINE
Teaching drama at a private school.
I think I might get it. It happened
really fast.

96.
CAROL
This is big news. Not what I
expected to hear.
KATHERINE
What do you expect to hear?
CAROL
I don’t expect anything.
KATHERINE
Nice. The vote of confidence.
CAROL
You know that’s not what I mean.
You happy about it?
KATHERINE
I’m happy about it... it’s not
acting.
Carol looks pensive.

But it’s good work. I hope you get

now look at me.
KATHERINE
Well, you’re a good person.
CAROL
When you were young, just a baby lucky for you that you don’t
remember it - you were so sick all
the time. I guess like all babies
are. Maybe a little more so. It
was a lot of illness and hospitals
and sleepless nights.

It was a stroke. A bad one. He

There was nothing they could do.

herself as a young girl. They are all smiling. The photo is
about 25 years old. She stands up and takes the photo out of
the room.

EXT. CAROL’S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

136

Carol is still sitting in a pool chair in the dark. Katherine
turns on the outside light and comes out.
CAROL
Can you leave that off, please?
KATHERINE
I want to show you something.
Katherine has the photo in her hand and hands it to Carol.
CAROL
(squinting)
Where was this?
KATHERINE
Maine, I think.
CAROL
Yes... Uncle Dave’s cabin in
Pemaquid.
Carol looks at it as if puzzling it out.
CAROL (CONT’D)
(quietly)
How did I end up here?
KATHERINE
What do you mean?
CAROL
I never thought I’d be seventy. I
just never thought about it and...
all of the sudden, here I am.
KATHERINE
That’s good thing.
(trying to be upbeat)
You’re still here.

102.
CAROL
Back when this picture was taken
getting old was the furthest thing
from our minds. I don’t remember
ever discussing with Bill, “Why
don’t you die in a plane crash, and
I’ll grow old alone.”
Silence for a beat. Katherine looks at her mother.
KATHERINE
So what were you thinking of?
CAROL
When the picture was taken?
Carol studies the photo. She shakes her head.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I don’t know. Pancakes?
Katherine laughs.
CAROL (CONT’D)
Is it really worth it? Any of it?
I mean, look at this. Look at what
we had here. We don’t have that
anymore.
KATHERINE
So we’ve got something else. And
maybe that’s the point of it. You
can regret it all, or you can CAROL
What’s the point of it all?
KATHERINE
How can you say that, mom?
CAROL
I just feel like... like I missed
something. Incomplete. Like
there’s supposed to be something
more to it. There has to be
something more, right?
KATHERINE
You’ve had a great life, mom. A
full life. You had a great husband,
you had a music career, you had a
wonderful career as a teacher --

103.
CAROL
Not that wonderful.
KATHERINE
You had me... What else is there?
CAROL
That’s all in the past tense.
Everything you just said, you’re
telling me about things I had,
things I did.
KATHERINE
So? Isn’t that what life is?
CAROL
I don’t know.
Katherine looks at Carol; Carol looks back.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I loved your father, honey. I hope
you know that.
KATHERINE
I know, mom.
Carol takes a deep breath.
CAROL
He wanted to get married, this guy.
Bill?

KATHERINE
Wow. Did you say yes?

CAROL
No. I was very rude, actually.
KATHERINE
It seems kind of soon to be asking.
CAROL
Not when you’re my age. Time is
short, see?
Well.

KATHERINE

CAROL
I guess he could’ve lived and we
could’ve gotten married and ended
up growing old together. But I
didn’t know him. So who knows?
(MORE)

104.
CAROL (CONT'D)
Maybe it would’ve worked out. Maybe
we would’ve been happy.
Katherine reaches for Carol’s arm.
Mom.

KATHERINE

Carol looks at Katherine and slightly smiles.
CAROL
I wonder what your father and I
would be like now...
Katherine squeezes Carol’s hand.

Carol wakes up and sits up in her chair, putting her feet on

Can I get you something?
CAROL
Yeah. I’ll have a, uh, apple-tini?
FEMALE BARTENDER
Sure thing.
Carol stops her as she goes to make it.
CAROL
Actually, just a Modelo... please.
The Female Bartender nods and smiles.

That’s only on Thursdays. Sorry.

Carol opens the door to reveal Lloyd in his new pool getup.
CAROL
Nice uniform.
LLOYD
Yeah. Pools By Us is a little
stricter about the dress code. You
like it?
CAROL
It becomes you. I like a man in
uniform.
Right.

LLOYD

CAROL
Come on in.
Lloyd follows Carol inside.
151

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Carol stops and turns around to face Lloyd.
CAROL
Do you want something to drink, or?
I’m okay.

LLOYD

CAROL
I don’t need the pool cleaned. The
other guy just did it, actually.

151

107.
LLOYD
Yeah? He do a good job?
CAROL
Eh. He’s okay.
There’s an awkward silence.
LLOYD
Listen. I’m sorry that I... I came
by the other day when your friend
was here.
Carol doesn’t respond.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
I should’ve called first or
something.
As Lloyd talks, Carol sees the RAT on the other side of the
room. She freezes up. Lloyd notices a change in Carol.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Are you okay?

Rat.

CAROL
(whispering, pointing)

Lloyd turns around and sees the rat, just sitting there.
Lloyd grabs a big, clear bowl on the nearby table and takes
some fruit out of it. He gets on the far side of the rat,
bowl in hand. The rat takes off towards him and he throws the
bowl over the rat, capturing it.
Got it!

LLOYD

The rat runs around, trapped inside the bowl. Lloyd grabs
some heavy books and puts them on top of the bowl keeping the
rat locked in. Lloyd looks up at Carol.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
What should I do with it? Should I
kill it, or...?
Carol looks at Lloyd and then down to the rat trapped in the
bowl. She breaks down and starts to cry. She sits down on the
couch and covers her face.
Lloyd, confused, stands up, leaving the rat trapped in the
bowl, and walks over to Carol.

108.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Are you okay? Carol?
Carol continues to cry.
Carol?

LLOYD (CONT’D)

Carol starts to pull herself together.
CAROL
I... I lost a friend. Recently...
You met him. His name was Bill.
LLOYD
That’s terrible, Carol.
CAROL
It’s okay, it’s okay. We went on a
couple of great dates. A sweet guy.
I liked him but, if I’m being
honest, I didn’t know him at all.
And then he just...
Lloyd looks on, listening.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I keep wondering what made his body
just...stop. What made it say “I’m
done now.”
Carol looks at Lloyd.
CAROL (CONT’D)
I just don’t get it, Lloyd.
LLOYD
There’s nothing to get.
Carol smiles and wipes away some tears.
CAROL
I hate that fucking rat.
This breaks the sadness and the two of them share a laugh.
LLOYD
Catching that rat might be my
biggest accomplishment right now.
CAROL
Oh, come on.

109.
LLOYD
I’m serious. I’m a bit of a
failure, Carol.
CAROL
You’re young. You’ve got a lot more
life to...
LLOYD
Screw it up even more?
CAROL
You’ve got plenty to show for it,
Lloyd. You know that.
LLOYD
So why can you see that in me and
not in yourself?
Carol thinks about this.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
And you can sing.
Sure...

CAROL

LLOYD
I clean pools.
(struggling to come up
with something to say)
I wrote a song.
CAROL
I want to hear it.
LLOYD
Someday I’ll sing it for you.
CAROL
Sing it now.
LLOYD
Really? I need something. A
guitar...
CAROL
I’ve got something.
152

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Lloyd sits with a ukulele in his hand. He strums it awkwardly
and decides to go for it.

110.
LLOYD
It’s not finished, but... Okay.
Carol leans forward.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
Keep your expectations low.
Lloyd sings his song to Carol. He finishes and looks up at
her.
LLOYD (CONT’D)
I’m still working on it. I don’t
know... There were no pools in it.
Carol touches his hand.
CAROL
Thank you, Lloyd.
For what?

LLOYD

CAROL
For stopping by and singing me that
song.
(pause)
And for catching the rat.
LLOYD
Well, I’m glad I was here.
Me too.

CAROL

They lean in and hug. As they pull apart from each other,
Carol looks at Lloyd and they look at each other in a way
that suggests they are about to kiss. Then they both lean
back, looking bemused. It’s unclear to both of them what’s
happening. Carol and Lloyd look away and then at each other
again.
LLOYD
(pointing back at the rat)
Should we do something about that
guy?

INT. CAROL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Carol and Lloyd watch as the Exterminator removes the rat
from the bowl and puts it into a container. He then bags the

CAROL
You want a drink?
Lloyd smiles.

INT. SALLY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

154

Carol sits at a card table playing bridge with Rona,
Georgina, and Sally. A hand has been dealt and the four
women are holding their cards and rearranging them in their
hands. They are drinking their usual.
SALLY
I think I gotta get out of here.
Go on a cruise or something. You
guys want to go with me? Come on,
ladies. I know you can all afford
it.
CAROL
Depends where you’re going.
And when.
And why.

GEORGINA
RONA

SALLY
Iceland. I don’t know. Anyplace. I
told you why. I’m feeling agitated.
RONA
I’m assuming you mean horny?
SALLY
(to Rona)
That’s what you mean.
GEORGINA
I hear good things about Iceland.
CAROL
I’m going to New York to see
Katherine next month.
SALLY
So let’s meet in New York and hop
on a boat someplace.

112.
RONA
I don’t know. I get seasick. And I
hear these stories about people
getting stranded, or everybody
getting sick with horrible
diarrhea...
SALLY
That sounds fun, right?
Silence.
GEORGINA
That fella, he had a boat, didn’t
he? Bill?
CAROL
(quietly)
He did. “So What.”
GEORGINA
(looking hurt)
I was just asking.
CAROL
That was the name of the boat,
Georgina. “So What.”
More quiet card playing.
SALLY
So what ever happened to his boat?
And all his stuff? No family?
RONA
Yeah. Did he really not have
anyone?
CAROL
No family. Really, truly, nobody.
Just a lawyer and lots of friends,
apparently, judging by the funeral.
I did ask his lawyer if I could
keep one thing of his.
RONA
They let you keep it?

What was it?

CAROL
It’s a secret.
GEORGINA
So what happened to his boat?
everything?

To

113.
CAROL
I don’t know. Last I saw his boat
it was still at the dock.
(pauses)
I can’t... I can’t know anything
more about him.
RONA
I’d be dying to know.
CAROL
I know you would.
More quiet card playing.
CAROL (CONT’D)
What the hell? Maybe we should go.
Iceland sounds nice.
It does.

GEORGINA

SALLY
Now that’s what I’m talking about.
I’ll bring Dramamine, Rona. You’ll
be fine.
RONA
And Imodium.
The girls share a laugh.

CAROL

MIKE
Haven’t seen you for a while...
I know.

CAROL

They stand there.
MIKE
Have you ever thought about getting
another dog? This guy could use a
new pal. And it’d be good to see
more of you, too, Carol.
CAROL
I don’t know. I just don’t think I
could lose something I love again.
Yeah.

MIKE

CAROL
What would you do?
MIKE
I... I’m 82 years old. If I stopped
getting dogs because they die on
you... I guess I’d’ve had my last
dog when Truman was president. It’s
hard, I know. But as long as you
enjoy them while they’re here, and
they enjoy you... you know, animals
die.
(looks affectionately at
his dog)
They break your heart.

That’s Beenie. She’s a sweetheart.
Carol looks over at BEENIE, who lies down with her head on
her paws.
SHELTER WORKER (CONT’D)
She’s older. I think she’s about 11
or 12.
(MORE)

116.
SHELTER WORKER (CONT’D)
The tough thing about dogs like
Beenie is that they’re close to the
end of their expectant life span
and prospective owners have a
difficult time with that... It’s
too bad. She is a sweetie. A family
had to give her up. I forget why...
Beenie looks up at Carol.
