INT. FIGHT CLUB/ BAR- TIJUANA MEXICO- DAY

1

We open on a mural of Jesus Christ, painted on the wall of
the bar. We pan down to reveal dank surroundings where
disinterested patrons are watching a brutal flyweight match
between TWO HISPANIC FIGHTERS.
2

INT. DRESSING ROOM- FIGHT CLUB/ BAR- TIJUANA MEXICO

2

More of a water stained box where ADONIS JOHNSON (20’S,
Black) leans from one side to another, attempting to stay
loose. FLORES (30’s) a battle scarred Mexican fighter, stands
across from Adonis, thick and menacing, with a neutral
expression. Adonis glances at his opponent, who stares back
emptily. The door opens off screen.
Vamanos!

REFFEREE (O.S.)

The two fighters stand up.
3

INT. RING- FIGHT CLUB/ BAR- TIJUANA MEXICO

3

Adonis, prances around the ring, avoiding Florez who is
struggling to make contact, and growing tired. Florez corners
Adonis up against the ropes, and after missing a few jabs,
WHAM he ducks into Adonis and lands a pretty deliberate head
but above his left eye, opening a deep gash. As Adonis tries
to recover: WHAM WHAM, he lands two bone crunching hooks to
the gut.
Adonis takes an airless breath and stumbles back to the
middle of the ring, wiping blood from the gash as the bell
sounds.
Adonis heads to the corner, where a WAITRESS (40s) puts a
stool down. He sits and she squirts water into his mouth.
The bell for Round 3 sounds. He starts towards Flores, with
more bounce in his stance. Flores takes a swing at his head,
and Adonis evades. Flores swings again, and again, even
harder, and Adonis ducks both and then crushes a left
uppercut into Flores' chin, followed by a flurry of
alternating punches that send Flores crashing to the mattunconscious.
The ref flies in waving, and Adonis spits his mouthpiece out
and heads to the corner.
REF
(in Spanish)
6-7-8-9-10

2.
Adonis looks on and starts biting at his glove to take it
off. The ref walks over and pulls $500 out of his pocket,
hands it to Adonis right there.

EXT. US MEXICO BORDER- DAY

4

Several cars line up at the inspection booths. Adonis, drives
in a primer colored 1967 Mustang, holding a T- shirt to his
eye. He hands his passport to the BORDER PATROL AGENT, who
looks at him, shakes his head, and signals him through.
5

INT. ER WAITING ROOM- LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL- EVENING 5
Adonis sits in a crowded ER waiting room.
NURSE (O.S.)
Donnie Johnson?

6

EXT. BALDWIN HILLS STREET- NIGHT

6

Adonis’ Mustang pulls into a hillside driveway. He punches a
code into a keypad, and a large iron gate opens. As he drives
up the cobblestone driveway we pull back to reveal a
breathtaking mansion, we notice the fresh bandage over his
eye.
7

INT. CREED MANSION- KITCHEN- CONTINUOUS

7

A hand wearing a massive wedding ring scoops beef stew into a
bowl. We pull up to reveal MARY-ANNE CREED (70s), dressed
modestly, but a regalness about her.
She slides the bowl in front of Adonis, who sits at the
kitchen island, and pours herself a glass of vodka. She puts
her hand to his cut.
MARY ANNE
Do you have to come here after your
fights? It’s like you want to rub
my nose in it.
ADONIS
It’s tradition.
(beat)
Don’t you want to know if I won?
MARY ANNE
It doesn’t matter. Even when you
win, you’re losing.
(beat)
(MORE)

3.
MARY ANNE (CONT'D)
You given any more thought to going
back to school?
Adonis doesn’t say anything.
MARY ANNE (CONT’D)
What about the internship?
ADONIS
Maybe... if it works with whatever
schedule Duke puts me on.
MARY ANNE
Have you even talked to him?
ADONIS
Tomorrow... what you got on TV?
MARY ANNE
Watching our boy.
8

INT. CREED MANSION- LIVING ROOM- HOURS LATER

8

ON SCREEN- Walter White, in a desert standoff with members of
a rival cartel, when... it cuts to credits.
Mary Anne and Adonis sit next to each other on the couch.
Adonis’ shoes off, his white socks dangling like a toddler.
ADONIS
You got another one in you?
MARY ANNE
Naw, grandma’s gotta head off to
bed... you gonna stay the night?
ADONIS
Naw, I’m gonna get to the house...
Beat.
MARY ANNE
How’s your mom?
ADONIS
She cool, I guess.
MARY ANNE
Good... that’s good.
Adonis stands up, and gives her a big hug.

4.
MARY ANNE (CONT’D)
See you tomorrow?
He nods.

EXT. CLABSADDLE HOUSE- DRIVEWAY- LATER THAT NIGHT

9

Adonis’ Mustang parks next to a Subaru SUV in front of the
two car garage of a small house in Silverlake.
10

INT. CLABSADDLE HOUSE- ADONIS’ BEDROOM- NIGHT- ONE HOUR LATER
10
Adonis sits in his room (a converted two car garage). He puts
his winnings into a large duffle bag, slides it under his
futon, plops down on it, and turns on HBO ON DEMAND. He hits
play on a Boxing Documentary. ON THE SCREEN WE SEE-

11

INT. PORTER’S CAR- DAY- TOXTETH, LIVERPOOL, UNITED KINGDOM 11
The camera shoots “PRETTY” RICKY PORTER (White, mid 30’s,
Scouse accent)- the unanimous #1 pound for pound fighter in
the world- as he walks around his old neighborhood with his
sons JUNIOR (8), and G (6, and small for his age) surrounded
by a nefarious entourage.
PORTER
See I’m from Toxteth. Nothin wrong
with it, it made me.
At the mention of Toxteth, some members of his entourage mock
firing pistols at the camera. Porter, and his crew walk up to
a boxing gym, nestled in the corner of a decaying
neighborhood.
PORTER (CONT’D)
(motions to Junior)
I was a lot smaller than him, a
cheeky little bastard I was. I used
to get me ass kicked coming home
from school every day.
A wiry, bespectacled man sticks his head out of the doorway
and looks into the camera with disdain- this is GILES HOLIDAY
(55, White) despite his slight build, he demands respect.
HOLIDAY
You gonna train or be a movie star?
Porter turns to Holiday and smiles.

5.
PORTER
Come down here, mate.
Holiday reluctantly obliges. He pats G on the head.
PORTER (CONT’D)
He found me, after some Evertonians
bashed me head in.
(motions to Holiday)
So he brought me in ere. Taught me
how to fight... Stopped pickin’ on
me after that didn’t they?
INSIDE THE GYM we cut to Porter- working drills with Holiday.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Porter is expected to be sentenced
within the year on a handgun charge
that could land him behind bars for
up to 7 years.
We see Porter being interviewed in a close- up.
PORTER
I feel like I could fight another
20 years. But numbers catch up to
everybody, so I’m treating this
like its me last...
Junior- wearing his Dad’s gold chain around his neck (it’s
huge on him) standing outside of the ring, mimicking his
dad’s moves. G watches him closely.
NARRATOR
His opponent, Danny Wheeler, is
arguably his most formidable
challenge, yet.
IN A HIGHLIGHT REEL we see shots of DANNY “STUNTMAN” WHEELER
(Late 20s, Black) taking out several opponents in the ring.
There is a cut to TONY “DUKE” BURTON standing next to him as
he holds up a belt post- fight.
Adonis looks on at the screen, anger flashing over his face.
He turns it off, picks up his dumbbells, and starts lifting.
12

INT. ADONIS BEDROOM - DAY

12

Adonis sleeps under a blanket. The bedroom door creaks open,
and small set of eyes peek through. KAYLA CLABSADDLE (8,
Biracial, curly hair, DEAF) walks into the room. She walks
over to Adonis and gently pushes his shoulders. He opens his
eyes. (They talk in American Sign Language w/ subtitles.)

6.
KAYLA
Wake up. Breakfast is ready.
He rolls back over and puts the pillow over his face. Kayla
jumps on top of him, landing right on his sore ribs.
ADONIS
Ahh, shit!
He pushes her, sending her to the carpet, laughing.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
You’re too heavy for that.
As she stands Adonis sits up, and she catches sight of his
bandage.
KAYLA
You were fighting again!
ADONIS
Don’t tell mom.
KAYLA
What’s in it for me?
Adonis stares her down for a beat, then motions to his wallet
on the coffee table. Kayla grabs it, and brings it back to
him. He pulls out a $5 bill and gives it to her. She puts it
in her pocket.
KAYLA (CONT’D)
Mom made you breakfast, what are
you gonna do?
Adonis looks at his phone, and sees that he overslept.
ADONIS
I’m running late. Go make me a
shake, and bring it to me.
Kayla nods and takes off.
13

INT. CLABSADDLE KITCHEN - DAY

13

Sunlight streams into a modest kitchen. LISA CLABSADDLE
(Black, a young looking 40) scrambles eggs next to DARYL
CLABSADDLE (White, 40’s) who pours coffee. Lisa watches
intently as Kayla scoops powder from Adonis’ muscle milk jug,
pours it into shake thermos and then adds water.
She closes it up and starts shaking it. Lisa looks at Daryl,
who is watching as well, and walks away shaking his head.

7.
Lisa taps Kayla. Who turns to her, innocently, shaking away
at the shake.
LISA
Is your brother awake?
Kayla guiltily looks back, still shaking the milkshake. She
shrugs “I don’t know”.
LISA (CONT’D)
Is he still in his room?
Kayla shrugs again. Lisa gives her the mother’s stare of
death.
14

INT. ADONIS’ BEDROOM

14

Adonis, pulls a hoodie over his head and preps his bag.
LISA (O.S.)
How could anybody drink this first
thing in the morning? It’s
disgusting.
Adonis turns around to see Lisa standing in the doorway,
holding his thermos. Kayla standing next to her guiltily.
Lisa walks down the steps into the room and hands Adonis the
thermos. He takes it, trying to hide his face, but he’s too
late.
LISA (CONT’D)
Jesus, what happened to your eye?
Stiches.

ADONIS

LISA
I’m talking about before the
stitches smart ass.
ADONIS
I got into a fight at a bar.
LISA
You’re 23 years old. At some point
you gotta stop solving problems
with your fists. You need to get a
job. Working out at the gym
everyday doesn’t count.
Having heard enough, he heads for the door.

8.

Wait.

LISA (CONT’D)

Adonis stops. Turns around.
LISA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, just come and eat some
real food. I cooked your favorite.
Sit down, and have some family
time.
ADONIS
Family time?
Yeah...

LISA

ADONIS
(beat)
You know I saw your mom last night.
LISA
Oh yeah? How’d that go?
ADONIS
You mean, “How is she?”
(beat)
She’s alone...
This lands on Lisa, hard. Adonis walks over to her, gives her
a kiss on the cheek, and heads out.
15

EXT. DUKE’S BOXING GYM PARKING LOT- SOUTH LOS ANGELES- DAY-15
CONTINUOUS
Adonis’ car turns into a gravel parking lot, in a dilapidated
neighborhood. He parks, hops out with his duffle bag. We
track up to reveal the sign. “DUKE’S BOXING GYM: WORLD
CLASS.”

16

INT. DUKE’S BOXING GYM- DAY- CONTINUOUS

16

Adonis changes into his boxing shoes and heads towards a
large ring where SEVERAL BOXERS are paired up, working
drills. Sitting outside the ring is DUKE (70s, black). Adonis
walks over to him.
ADONIS
I’m ready to train. Let me know
what warm-ups you want me starting
with.

9.
DUKE
What are you talking about?
Adonis tosses the open duffle bag on the edge of the ring,
right in front of Duke.
ADONIS
That’s my training fees for a year
up front.
Duke peers into the bag for a beat, sighs, then hands it
back.
DUKE
Go home, son.
Duke goes to turn back, and Adonis grabs his shoulder.
ADONIS
I’m not leaving this gym today
until you agree to train me.
Duke looks into Adonis’ eyes closely. And turns back to the
ring, verbally coaching up the athletes inside. Adonis pushes
past Duke and jumps into the ring.
17

INT. RING- DUKE’S BOXING GYM- CONTINUOUS

17

The boxers stop sparring, and they look at Adonis, who turns
to the corner and shakes the contents of his gym bag outgloves, a mouthpiece, and $10,000 cash.
ADONIS
I got 10 stacks right here. Cash!
Ready for whoever wants to come get
it.
Adonis puts on his gloves and turns around to the fighters in
the ring. They look at him, but none are up for the
challenge.
Adonis!

DUKE

ADONIS
Easy money, right?
Outside the ring, fighters have stopped their workouts and
inch closer to the brewing spectacle. A fighter, tall and
lean, about Adonis’ age starts to approach the ring, this is
KEV. Adonis locks eyes with him.

10.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Kev, you gonna be first up?
KEV
Look at your eye, cuz. Looks like
somebody beat me to it.
The room guffaws... Adonis doesn’t.
ADONIS
So it should be easy for you
right?? I’ll put my money where my
mouth is.
Adonis bends down and clumsily grabs a rubber banded stack of
money. He places it in his mouth, biting down on it like a
mouthpiece.
Kev shakes his head at this, bites down on his mouthpiece,
and slides into the ring. The two fighters circle each other:
Kev’s stance high and tight- Adonis’ low, flamboyant, and
taunting.
Kev swings a right jab, but Adonis easily evades it. Kev
swings again, Adonis leans back drops his guard, and starts
to rock side to side. Frustrated, Kev takes two more swings,
and Adonis parries one, ducks the other and comes hard with a
right cross to Kev’s chin. Kev’s jaw rattles and he hits the
floor in a heap, face down, unconscious.
Adonis spits the money out and it lands on Kev’s back.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
C’mon! Who next, huh? Which one of
ya'll want it with the rich kid.
You pick em Duke! You pick which
one!
I’m next.

MAN’S VOICE

Adonis turns to see DANNY WHEELER (who we recognize from HBO)
standing in the crowd outside the ring. A hush falls over the
gym as Wheeler stares Adonis down with silent confidence.
Danny steps into the ring, and straps up his gloves, while
Adonis bends down and puts his mouthpiece in. Adonis reaches
out to touch gloves with Wheeler, who knocks them away and
moves in quick.

11.
Adonis backs up, sends a couple of left jabs. Wheeler ducks
one, parries the other, and sends a quick flurry back at
Adonis. Adonis dodges them but is forced into the ropes in
retreat.
WHEELER
Stop runnin, boy...
Adonis reloads, and starts back at Wheeler. He creeps in
cautiously, sends two jabs at Wheeler, the first (head)
misses, the second (Body) connects. He follows with hook, and
Wheeler ducks, and comes up with an uppercut, followed by a
straight shot to Adonis’ forehead. Adonis goes crashing to
the matt- ass first. The gym ROARS.
He shakes it off and bounces up to his feet.
WHEELER (CONT’D)
Stay down...
He stands back up, gets into his stance, and moves in on
Wheeler who cages up, and leans on the ropes, blocking Adonis
shots with his arms.
WHEELER (CONT’D)
You ready, rich boy?
Wheeler strikes back with two quick jabs to Adonis’ face,
sidesteps Adonis’ counter and lands a left hook to the gut
that doubles him over. Then WHAM! He slams a right hook into
Adonis’ face, reopening his wound.
Adonis drops to one knee, trying to find his bearings.
Stay down!

WHEELER (CONT’D)

Adonis stands up, trying to shake the hit off, and bangs his
gloves together. He puts his hands up to fight again. He goes
at Wheele, swinging wildly. Wheeler ducks the shots, then
slams a left uppercut into his body, then sends a right
cross, knocking his mouthpiece out.
Go down!

WHEELER (CONT’D)

Adonis, nearly out on his feet, puts his hands up to keep
fighting. He takes another swing. Wheeler evades easily and
bangs another punch into Adonis’ jaw. He stumbles back, and
chokes on something, then spits out a bloody molar.
Go down.

WHEELER (CONT’D)

12.
He puts his hands back up, and moves in Wheeler, barely on
balance. He swings hard, but Wheeler slips him, and connects
with a stiff left to his face, sending him crashing to the
mat.
HARD CUT TO
BLACK
FADE IN- ADONIS’ POV WHILE LAYING ON HIS BACK IN THE RINGSERIES OF SHOTS
- Wheeler picking up Adonis’ cash.
- Other fighters giving Wheeler pats on his back.
- Duke standing over Adonis- looking at him with concern.
DUKE
Get the medic...
18

INT. DUKE’S OFFICE

18

The MEDIC (Black, 60’s) has just finished stitching up
Adonis’ eye and heads out of the room. Duke walks in and sits
down across from Adonis.
ADONIS
Why won’t you help me, man.
DUKE
Besides you disrespecting me in my
own gym?
ADONIS
I gotta get your attention somehow.
DUKE
You got it, and you’ve got my
answer.
ADONIS
Then I’ll go to somebody else.
DUKE
It’s not gonna matter. I promised
your grandmother that I’d do
everything in my power to keep you
from boxing. And that’s what I’m
gonna do.
(beat)
Now you want to go out to Mexico
and get yourself killed in one of
those bar fights, I can’t control
that. But around here, my word is
law.

13.
Adonis looks at Duke.
DUKE (CONT’D)
All that aside, kid. You’re not
even that good.
19

INT. CREED MANSION LIVING ROOM- DAY

19

Mary Anne sits on the couch, sipping from a glass, and
smiling at the television.
ON THE SCREEN- a home video of the Creed family, circa 1980.
Grandma!

ADONIS (O.S.)

Adonis storms into the living room, and turns off the TV.
Mary Anne gives him a look that could kill as he sits down
next to her.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
I need you to call Duke.
MARY ANNE
I just got off the phone with him.
He told me Wheeler tore you a new
one.
ADONIS
I need you to call him and tell him
to train me.
MARY ANNE
Must be your concussion talking.
ADONIS
You going behind my back telling
people not to touch me? That stops
today.
MARY ANNE
A woman protects her family. Even
from themselves.
ADONIS
I’m a grown man. This is what I
want to do with my life.
MARY ANNE
You don’t know what you want. Look
at your face.
(MORE)

14.
MARY ANNE (CONT'D)
I can’t tell you how many times I
had to sit up feeding Appolo
because his eyelids were swollen
shut. Or wiping his ass because he
couldn’t move his arms. Apollo gave
his life, so you wouldn’t have to
do this.
ADONIS
Oh, so that’s why he took that last
fight?
Mary Anne cuts Adonis a cold look.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
He didn’t need the money. Why’d he
do it? Maybe he was sick of being
cooped up in this house with your
controlling assWHAP! Mary Anne slaps the taste out of his mouth. Adonis
turns his head back to her for a beat, then storms out.
20

INT. CREED MANSION / TROPHY ROOM - DAY

20

Adonis is surrounded by the success of his grandfather Apollo
Creed. His eyes track the framed items on the walls: Apollo’s
American Flag Shorts, championship belts, humanitarian
awards, and pictures shaking hands with Presidents. His eyes
fall on a newspaper article with a picture of Apollo and
Rocky Balboa the clipping reads, “CREED TRAINS FORMER RIVAL”.
He goes over to a cabinet underneath the newspaper clippings,
and digs through a box. He takes an unseen object and storms
out.
21

INT. CLABSADDLE HOUSE / ADONIS ROOM - NIGHT

21

Adonis looks at the Wikipedia page for Rocky Balboa on his
iPAD. He taps the link to Adrian’s, website “CONTACT”. The
address is in Philadelphia.
22

INT. USED BOOKSTORE- PHILADELPHIA

22

Massive hands pick up a worn, paperback romance novel off the
display rack. The hands belong to ROCKY BALBOA (60’s, ItalianAmerican). He looks at the cover, through his glasses, and
mouths along to the title.
He slaps the book down on the checkout counter.

15.
STORE OWNER (O.S.)
That’ll be all champ?
ROCKY
Yup. Till next time.
(touches his stomach)
You think I could use your
bathroom.
23

INT. BOOKSTORE BATHROOM

23

On Rocky, leaning up against the walls of the stall, vomiting
into the toilet. He stands up, wipes his mouth.
24

EXT. USED BOOKSTORE- PHILADELPHIA

Rocky exits the store, book in tow headed towards his
industrial, white van parked on the sidewalk. He crosses the
street towards a corner-store
25

INT. LIQUOR STORE- PHILADELHIA

25

Rocky walks up to the CLERK (40’s Palestinian), eyeing the
liquor on display behind him.
ROCKY
How ya doin. Let me get a little
bottle of Four Roses.
The clerk grabs a pint of the cheap stuff, puts it in a paper
bag, and sits it on the counter in front of Rocky.
CLERK
Gonna have to see some ID, champ.
Rocky smiles as he counts out $15 and hands it over. The
clerk tries to give him change back, but Rocky declines it.
26

EXT. CEMETERY- ADRIAN’S PLOT- DUSK

26

The bouquet sits next to ADRIAN BALBOA’s headstone. Rocky
sits in a chair across from it, glasses on, reading the book
outloud. He comes to the end of the chapter, dog ears the
page and closes the book. He stands up, hides his folding
chair in the a tree, and starts off.
He stops at another headstone, and pulls the bottle of Four
Roses out of the bag, and sits it down, unopened on the
tombstone. We see it reads “PAULIE PENNINO” 1940-2012. Rocky
heads off towards his car.

16.
27

INT. CALIFORNIA MEN’S COLONY- SAN LOUIS OBISPO

27

We find Adonis, waiting in a line of visitors going through
processing. Guards look on, past the metal detectors, as
Adonis places his personal items in the X-Ray machine trays.
28

INT. VISITING ROOM- CMC SLO

28

Adonis sits down in a row of plastic chairs on the visitors
side of the glass panel. Several visits are going on on
either side of him, with INMATES, speaking with visitors
through black phones.
A BUZZ is heard, and TERREL JOHNSON (40’s) a man of slight
build but intense eyes, emerges from the prison door and sits
down across from Adonis. They stare at each other through the
thick glass. He picks up the phone. Adonis picks up his.
TERREL
Look at you. All that hair on your
face. What are you now, 22?
23.

ADONIS

Terrel takes this in.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
I’m leaving tomorrow. Going to the
East Coast. Not planning on coming
back.
TERREL
That’s good. Wish I had some cool
advice to give you... but you done
outgrew mine.
ADONIS
I didn’t come for advice. Just
wanted to tell you face to face.
Terrel nods.
TERREL
Did you win?
Adonis nods. Terrel smiles.
TERREL (CONT’D)
I’ll look for you, in the papers,
and on ESPN.

17.
ADONIS
I aint even got nothin’ set up out
there. Don’t know if I ever will...
TERREL
Hey. It aint like I don’t got time.
ADONIS
Alright man.
Aight.

TERREL

They hang up their phones, and stand up on opposite sides of
the glass. Adonis watches as Terrel heads back to the
hallway.
29

EXT. CLABSADDLE FRONT LAWN - DAY

29

29

Adonis, stands next to his car and several bags of luggage,29
holding an envelope full of cash. He’s staring at a
CRAIGSLIST CUSTOMER (40’s, Hispanic), who sits in the
driver’s seat. He fires up the engine, tosses a peace sign up
to Adonis, and drives off into the distance.
Kayla runs out of the house towards him and grabs his leg.
Adonis grabs her back and squeezes her tight. He bends down
to her.
KAYLA
Are you ever coming back?
ADONIS
I’m not sure.
KAYLA
How will we talk?
ADONIS
We’ll use the computer.
KAYLA
Are you gonna fight?
Yes.

ADONIS

KAYLA
You better win.
Adonis forces a smile as the cab pulls up. Kayla heads back
towards the house, and he gets in.

18.

EXT. PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE- SUNRISE- SIX HOURS LATER

30

A commercial plane moves along the horizon, with downtown
Philadelphia’s skyscrapers looming in the foreground.
31

EXT. ADONIS’ PHILADELPHIA APARTMENT BUILDING

31

A yellow cab lets Adonis out at the corner. He looks up at a
sparce brick apartment complex.
32

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT HALLWAY

32

Adonis stands next to his LANDLORD (Filipina, 50s) who finds
the keys to his unit.
LANDLADY
A lot of young people here,
students, artists. Not too many
families. You’ll like it.
Adonis looks down the hallway as a WHITE GUY gets onto the
elevator. At the last second a WOMAN (Black, 20’s long
dreadlocks, stunning) carrying a subwoofer catches the
elevator doors. She gets on, not noticing Adonis staring her
down as the elevators close. He turns his attention back to
the Landlady, as she opens his door.
Series of shots
-Adonis has just finished moving into a studio apartment-.
It’s modest. Adonis grabs his phone, and exits.
-Adonis stands at the top of the Art Museum steps, looking up
at the Rocky statue, the sun setting behind it.
33

INT. ADRIAN’S RESTAURANT

33

Rocky places large boxes onto a rack. FRIEDA, the hostess,
enters the narrow staircase and near the bottom sees Rocky at
the stove in discussion with the HISPANIC CHEF, and TWO
KITCHEN WORKERS.
Rocky?

FRIEDA

Rocky turns towards the staircase.
Yeah?

ROCKY

19.
FRIEDA
There’s some guy who wants to talk
with ya.
ROCKY
Kinda late...
FRIEDA
Want me to tell him you already
left?
I got it.
34

ROCKY

INT. ADRIAN’S RESTAURANT

34

Upstairs Adonis stares at the many pictures depicting Rocky’s
career. On the wall are his title belts too.
His eyes settle on a large dynamic painting of Rocky and
Apollo, about to exchange blows.
Because of the hour, there are only four remaining diners as
usual, opera music is faintly heard.
Adonis hears heavy footsteps coming up the basement stairs.
His eyes travel from the vibrant painting to Rocky appearing
at the top of the stairs. Rocky removes his glasses as he
approaches.
Adonis is slightly taken aback by the “present” Rocky, and
the colorful youthful image seen on the painting.
ROCKY
How ya doin’?
(off Adonis’ non- answer)
I hear you wanna talk to me?
ADONIS
(glancing at the painting)
Painting’s cool... who landed
first?
ROCKY
That’s a secret...
Rocky notices the stitches.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
You a fighter, huh?
(off Adonis’ nod)
That from a punch or a butt.

20.

Butt.

ADONIS

ROCKY
Terrible feeling, you know? Like ya
been kissed by a rock...
ADONIS
I seen a lot of your old fights.
ROCKY
Don’t ya got nothin better to do?
What’s ya name?
ADONIS
Adonis. Everybody calls me Donnie
though.
Different-

ROCKY

ADONIS
I didn’t pick it. It’s GrecoRoman. My grandfather had a name
like that.
ROCKY
That’s niceADONIS
I never met him. But you did.
Oh yeah?

ROCKY

ADONIS
They say you never really know
somebody till you fight them, so
you probably knew him better than
anybody.
Rocky does the math, while Adonis looks back towards the
painting.
ROCKY
Where you say you were from, kid?
ADONIS
Los Angeles.
Rocky stares.

21.
ROCKY
Apollo? Apollo’s your GRANDfather?!
Wait, he had two little girls and..
Lisa.

ADONIS

ROCKY
Little Lisa? You’re Lisa’s kid? Has
it been that long...
Rocky smiles and covers his hand with his mouth. He can’t
believe it. Then it hits him.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
What are you doing fighting?
Adonis looks around for a beat.
ADONIS
You think we could sit down
somewhere and talk?
35

ADRIAN’S RESTAURANT- LATER
Everyone is gone, only the back lights are on. Rocky and
Adonis sit at a table. Rocky drinks wine, Adonis water.
ROCKY
Apollo was something that was like
invented. Had all the good stuff,
heart, brains, power, forget it.
Hit so hard, you felt like you were
on a rocket to planet pain. And he
had this mental thing... called it
“The Eye of The Tiger”
ADONIS
Eye of the Tiger? Sounds corny.
ROCKY
Corny? It saved my life. The
hunger, the drive. He could make
things happen out of nothing. He’d
be loosing, then BAM, one shot, one
special move, now he’s won- it was
magic.
ADONIS
Then how’d you beat him?

35

22.
ROCKY
It was just my time. He had won
fifty fights. Nobody stays strong
forever.
(beat)
So why’d you come here?
ADONIS
I want you to train me.
ROCKY
Train ya? I’m no trainer.
ADONIS
Be my teacher, then. Why should I
have to go to some other lame, when
we could keep it in the family.
ROCKY
Family? Well...
He’s at a loss for words.
ADONIS
You gotta miss it...
ROCKY
Miss it? No. I got it all outta my
system, and I don’t look back.
ADONIS
Why’d you do it in the first place?
ROCKY
I had nothin. Less than nothin.
ADONIS
And it gave you something, right?
And I’m not talking about the
money.
ROCKY
Yeah it gave me something. But it
made me loose a lot of things too.
That’s the thing about boxing, it
takes more than it gives, you know?
ADONIS
Can say that about life.
(beat)
Look, it’s something inside of me,
telling me I gotta do this. But I’m
missing something that can take me
to the next level.
(MORE)

23.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
I think that’s you. You can show me
how to do it right.
ROCKY
Y’know- Apollo died in my hands.
I watched my friend die, knowing I
shoulda stopped it. That was what
it was; now you’re here. I don’t
want it. He wouldn’t either.
Adonis takes this in. Digs into his bag and pulls out a VHS
tape. He sits it down in front of Rocky.
ADONIS
Brought you this, check it out, if
you still got something that can
play it.
Adonis stands up.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
I’ll be at your old gym tomorrow.
Check me out if you feel up to it.
ROCKY
Sold that place, haven’t been there
in years.
He starts towards the door, and on his way out he stops by
the painting again.
ADONIS
So who landed first?
He did.
Figures...

ROCKY
ADONIS

Adonis exits as Rocky stares after the departing young man,
trying to make sense of it all.
36

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT- NIGHT
Adonis lays on his back in his bed struggling to sleep as
LOUD music can be heard in the room above his head.
He pulls the pillow from over his ear, and looks up at the
ceiling.

36

24.
37

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY

37

Adonis, now wearing a T shirt and shorts, knocks on the door
that the music is coming from. After a beat, the music stops.
The door opens, but is stopped by the security chain, and
BIANCA (20’s, Black, dreadlocks) peeks her head out and looks
at Adonis with a confused look. Adonis looks back caught off
guard. It’s not who he expected to be there.
She looks at him, eyebrows raised. Adonis snaps out of it.
Hey.
Yeah?

ADONIS
BIANCA

ADONIS
I just moved in downstairs.
Yeah?

BIANCA

ADONIS
I can hear your music through the
ceiling.
BIANCA
Oh! You must be right under me.
Yeah.

ADONIS

BIANCA
That unit’s been empty for a
while... Got used to it.
ADONIS
Yeah, I gotta workout early in the
morning... so.
BIANCA
Gotchu. You gotta wake up early
and do ya jawns.
(mimes doing pushups)
Keep your body tight... I’ll turn
the bass waay down you won’t hear a
peep.
Bianca closes the door, almost in Adonis’ face.

25.
38

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER

38

Adonis lays down on his back looking up at the ceiling. The
music still plays, but so quietly that he has to strain to
hear it.
39

EXT. ROCKY’S HOUSE- MORNING

39

On the same street Rocky’s row house blends in with all the
others. The door leading to the tiny back yard open, and
Rocky exits. Dressed in modest, out of style clothing, and an
old sweatshirt, he sits down on the top step and looks at the
incredibly old, cracked heavy bag that still hangs from its
rusted chain. He sips coffee from a mug and thinks.
40

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- DAY

40

Several FIGHTERS warm up inside. Adonis walks past a small
SIX YEAR OLD fighter sitting at the edge of the ring, putting
on his hand wraps.
Adonis turns to the larger ring, where LEO “THE ASSASSIN”
SPORINO JR. (20’s Italian American) works drills with his
father “PISTOL” PETE SPORINO (40s Italian) who still looks
like he may have a couple of fights left in him. Above the
ring a large banner reads “2012 Golden Gloves Champion Leo
“THE ASSASSIN” Sporino Jr. . Leo’s entourage looks on.
41

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- MOMENTS LATER
Adonis and Sporino talk ringside, between rounds.
SPORINO
The membership is $50 dollars a
month. You get unlimited access to
the gym, and all the equipment. You
with a trainer?
Not yet.

ADONIS

SPORINO
You amateur?
Pro.

ADONIS

SPORINO
Oh yeah? Where you from?

41

26.

LA.

ADONIS

SPORINO
Hollywood!
(beat)
Which gym? I know all those guys.
This stops Adonis in his tracks.
ADONIS
More self taught than anything.
SPORINO
Self taught... pro...
(long beat)
Well most members just work
themselves out. For an extra $20 a
month. I can give you drills, and
check in with you when I can. You
want to do that?
Adonis nods.
MOMENTS LATER- We find Adonis in the corner, doing step and
punch on air, next to the six year old fighter, and a couple
of other young BOXERS. He looks over at Leo working drills,
envious.
42

EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET- NIGHT

42

Adonis walks down the sidewalk, looking around, questioning
if he made the right move coming out to Philly.
As he approaches a building, he sees a line of hipsters,
mostly black standing outside. Hip- Hop music plays from
inside. He keeps walking: not his type of crowd, but as he
passes the window, he sees that stops him in his tracks. He
looks back at the line, and heads towards it. The camera
tracks over to reveal a large flyer with a photo of Bianca on
it.
43

INT. PENN CAFE- MOMENTS LATER
Adonis, holding a beer, stands in the back of the crowd
watching Bianca finish up her set.
BIANCA
This last song, is for anyone who
has ever had their heart broken.

43

27.
The HOUSE BAND starts, and Bianca closes her eyes, moving to
the beat. She sings, with a beautiful edge to her voice.
Adonis watches her closely, she opens them and they seem to
catch eyes.
44

INT. PENN CAFE- MOMENTS LATER

44

Adonis watching the musicians packing up. We see his POV:
Bianca giving the guitarist a hug. She walks over to the bar,
and the BARTENDER hands over her purse from behind the
counter.
ADONIS
Wussup, neighbor.
Bianca looks up and sees Adonis, recognizing him immediately.
She turns back to her purse. Putting the pack of cigarettes
back inside.
BIANCA
Workout boy. I thought that was
you.
Adonis smiles this off.
Nice show.

ADONIS

BIANCA
(disinterested)
Thanks.
ADONIS
Yeah... Can I buy you a drink?
No.

BIANCA

ADONIS
Wussup, you don’t drink?
BIANCA
I drink. I’m just not drinking with
you.
Why not?

ADONIS

BIANCA
Cause I know your type.
My type?

ADONIS

28.
BIANCA
The type who hits the gym in the
morning and picks up broads in bars
at night.
She’s got him, he tries to regroup.
ADONIS
I’m not trying to pick you up, I’m
extending an olive branch... Last
night, I didn’t know you were...
Working?

BIANCA

ADONIS
Yeah.
(beat)
And I don’t just go to the gym for
the hell of it... I’m a boxer.
Bianca looks at him for a quick beat.
BIANCA
A boxer, like pro?
Yeah.

ADONIS

BIANCA
I thought boxers weren’t supposed
to drink.
Adonis looks down at his cup.
ADONIS
I’m off the clock.
BIANCA
Oh...
(checks the time on her
phone)
Well I’m not... see you around.
She heads off.
Wait...

ADONIS

She’s already too far to hear him. Adonis looks down at his
drink, then around the club.

29.
45

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT- NIGHT

45

Adonis sits on his back, video chatting with Kayla on his
iPAD. He says goodnight to her and hangs up. Just as Bianca’s
music starts up again. Adonis listens for a bit. Then gives
up on any chance of sleeping, and rolls out of bed and starts
doing pushups.
46

INT. BT CONVENTION CENTER / BACKSTAGE - DAY

46

It’s a PACKED HOUSE- a sellout crowd has gathered the around
the weigh- in stage. A banner reads: PORTER VS WHEELER:
FIGHT OF THE CENTURY. Wheeeler and Porter, wearing only black
briefs, approach each other for the stare down. Nose to nose,
the two mumble threats at each other, until Porter pushes his
forehead against Wheeler’s face. Wheeler gives him a hard
shove back and, WHAM! Porter cracks Wheeler across his face
with a right, crumpling him. A melee breaks out as both camps
descend on each other. FREEZE FRAME ON THE CHAOS
ESPN ANCHOR (V.O.)
That was the scene earlier today at
the weigh in for the PorterWheeler fight.
47

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- DAY

47

We pull back to reveal Adonis and a few other patrons
watching Sportscenter in between rounds.
ESPN ANCHOR
Wheeler, who suffered a broken jaw
in the fight, and has already
announced plans to sue both Porter,
and the WBC.
Adonis goes back over to the heavy bag, and works drills away
from all of the action of Sporino, Leo, and their entourage.
48

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT- NIGHT

48

Adonis paces his apartment, bored. Bianca’s music can be
heard from upstairs. He walks over to his kitchen and looks
inside of the refrigerator- nothing but bachelor food. He
looks up at his ceiling.
49

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT HALLWAY-

49

Adonis knocks on Bianca’s door. This time she doesn’t stop
the music, and just opens the door and stares at him blankly.

30.
ADONIS
I’ve been hearing you up here
working for a while.
(beat)
I was wondering if, you wanted to
grab a bite?
Bianca looks at him suspiciously.
BIANCA
You asking me out on a date? Or are
you extending another olive branch?
ADONIS
I’m asking you if you’re hungry.
(beat)
I know how I am when I’m focused.
Sometimes I forget to eat... It’s
not a date...
Bianca stares at him. Then looks back into her room.
BIANCA
I can’t do more than an hour. Where
did you want to go?
ADONIS
I was hoping you could tell me.
Maybe we go somewhere in your hood.
BIANCA
My hood?
(beat)
You sure you ready for that?
Adonis nods. Bianca smiles.
50

EXT. WEST PHILLY STREET CORNER- NIGHT
Adonis follows Bianca closely as they walk towards a
florescent soaked Chinese Food Restaurant on a gritty,
graffiti stained street corner.
Several young, tough looking, kids stand outside on the
street, staring Adonis down.
ADONIS
Where are we right now?
BIANCA
West Philly.

50

31.
ADONIS
So this is why the Fresh Prince’s
mom sent him to Bel Air.
Bianca chuckles at this.
51

INT. CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANT- PHILLY

51

It’s a gritty restaurant. Graffiti stained windows, mostly
African- American patrons, Chinese American staff serves the
register.
We find Bianca and Adonis sitting down near a window, tearing
into their food with their chopsticks.
BIANCA
I been coming to this jawn since I
was a kid. My parents own a store a
couple blocks over.
She scrapes pieces of general chicken onto his plate.
ADONIS
What’s a jawn?
BIANCA
Jawn... that’s Philly for anything.
(Pointing out each item of
food)
See these, is jawns. These is
jawns. That shirt you’re wearing,
that’s a jawn.
Adonis smiles at his cultural tour guide.
ADONIS
You got a dude?
Bianca shakes her head.
BIANCA
Too much going on right now. Don’t
have the time.
ADONIS
Booking a lot of shows?
Bianca nods.
BIANCA
Need about 5 a month just to pay
the rent. Also making a ton of
music.
(MORE)

32.
BIANCA (CONT'D)
Tryna finish this EP by next week.
Got a shot at opening for Rihanna
ADONIS
Word, is that a big one?
BIANCA
Huge, all the big acts from here
played there first. Jill, Legend,
the Roots...
ADONIS
That’s wussup!
BIANCA
It’s a long shot.
ADONIS
I got faith in you.
(beat)
How long have you been singing?
BIANCA
Since I was young... how long have
you been boxing?
ADONIS
I’ve been boxing pro for like two
years.
Bianca looks at him.
BIANCA
You don’t seem like a boxer to me.
You look like one, you know... but
ain’t most boxer’s like...
What?

ADONIS

BIANCA
Street? Not saying you’re a
square... but how’d you get into to
doing this?
Adonis looks at her for a long beat. Deciding whether or not
to tell her the truth.
ADONIS
I had a lot of anger issues when I
was young. Something about boxing
always calmed me down.
She looks at him, seeing him a bit differently now.

33.
BIANCA
Why you come out here?
ADONIS
I got like an uncle out here who
was a real dope boxer. Trying to
get him to train me.
BIANCA
He doesn’t want to?
Adonis shakes his head.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
You seem pretty convincing to me. I
think you’ll get him to come
around.
ADONIS
I don’t know...
BIANCA
Just be honest with him.
ADONIS
What do you mean.
BIANCA
Do you want him to train you
because him he was a good boxer...
or do you want him to train you
because he’s your family?
ADONIS
Because he’s my family, I guess.
BIANCA
Come at him like that.
Adonis thinks on this.
ADONIS
When is your next show? I wanna
come and support.
BIANCA
You don’t gotta do that.
ADONIS
Too late. First show was too
dope... I’m a groupie now.
Bianca smiles at Adonis for a bit, trying to figure him out.
He looks down at the food, noticing its all gone.

34.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Well. Should we blow this jawn?
Bianca nods and they get up.
52

INT. BUS- NIGHT- MOMENTS LATER

52

Adonis and Bianca sit next to each other on the bus riding
back. Bianca falls asleep. Adonis slowly puts his arm around
her. Just as it touches her, she wakes up, and he subtly
plays it off. He smiles.
53

INT. ADONIS’ APARTMENT HALLWAYAdonis walks Bianca to the door of her apartment. Bianca
stops at her door and turns around.
BIANCA
Thanks for the food. Good night.
ADONIS
You gonna work some more?
BIANCA
I’ll use the headphones, don’t
worry.
ADONIS
Naw, I was gonna see if it was cool
to come in and listen.
BIANCA
Ha. You move fast, don’t you?
Adonis smiles, taking the loss.
ADONIS
I only got one gear...
Good night.
Nite.

BIANCA

She opens the door and goes inside. Adonis heads down the
hall. Bianca pops back out of the door.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
What’s your name.
ADONIS
Oh, Donnie.

53

35.
BIANCA
I need your government. For the
guest list. I gotta a show Friday
night at the Luxe. No pressure.
Adonis pauses for a moment.
ADONIS
Adonis Johnson.
Bianca chuckles at this.
BIANCA
Seriously? That’s a practical joke
of a name. Might as well be named
Guapo.
ADONIS
Don’t. My mom had me young. It’s a
long story.
BIANCA
Alright, Adonis. I’ll put you down.
ADONIS
See you then.
54

INT. RING MICKEY’S GYM- DAY
TITO (Hispanic, 20s), Leo’s sparring partner stands in the
corner of the ring where CUT MEN attempt to stop his nose
from bleeding.
TITO
I can still go...
CUT MAN
We can’t stop it.
SPORINO
Jesus. Take him out of here...
(looks around for another
person)
Hollywood!
Adonis looks up.
SPORINO (CONT’D)
(under his breath to Leo)
Says he’s pro...
(to Adonis)
Let’s go, it’s your lucky day.

54

36.
55

INT. RING- MICKEY’S GYM- MOMENTS LATER

55

Adonis adjusts his headgear, trying to warm up. In the other
corner, Leo stands already good to go.
The bell sounds, and the fighters head towards each other.
Adonis comes out with a lot of bounce, evasive but Leo,
focused and methodical, quickly cuts the ring off on him and
begins to punish him with jabs and hooks to the body.
56

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- BACK

56

A door unlocks and opens in the back corner of the gym, away
from the commotion of the ring, and Rocky steps in keys in
hand. He’s dressed even more modestly than usual, as he walks
towards the commotion of the sparring match, hanging back,
out of sight.
57

INT. RING- CONTINUOUS

57

Adonis is leaning up against the ropes, his back to Rocky,
caged up against an all out barrage of hooks from Leo.
SPORINO
C’mon Hollywood, lets see that West
Coast swag.
He leans back on the ropes and counters, the first one lands,
but Leo ducks the second and lands a three hit combo on
Adonis’ head. The last one sending him to a knee.
Leo backs off holding his hands up in the air.
LEO
Pro, what? Get me another one,
pops!
Adonis tries to shake off the blow, and he looks outside the
ring and catches eyes with, Rocky. Who looks back at Adonis
with a worried look. Almost on- sight, Adonis stands up. He
bangs his gloves together.
ADONIS
Come’ on. I thought philly was
tough, them love taps, boy!
Leo turns around to Adonis. Rage in his eyes. He comes at
Adonis swinging hard. Adonis ducks the punches, and counters
with two hard left jabs to his nose, each one snapping his
head back. Leo stumbles back, then counters with a hook to
Adonis’ gut.

37.
The round buzzer sounds and Adonis backs off, but Leo comes
forward wanting more. Blood trickles out of his left nostril.
Come’ on!

LEO

Sporino comes into the ring and quickly steps between the two
fighters.
SPORINO
Hollywood, you’re good for the day.
He grabs Leo’s face, looking at his nose.
LEO
Naw, let us keep rockin.
SPORINO
Chill out. What are you gonna have
World War III in a sparring
session...
Adonis turns back to where Rocky was standing, and finds: no
one. He bites at his glove tape, dejected.
58

EXT. ADRIAN’S RESTAURANT- NIGHT

58

Rocky is seen turning out the lights, then exits. He begins
to cross the street when he hears a familiar voice.
ADONIS (O.S.)
Why’d you leave?
ROCKY
Whatya doin out here?
ADONIS
Taking a walk... that was you at
the gym, right?
ROCKY
Yeah that was me. Had to get back
to some things here.
ADONIS
Why didn’t you stay.
ROCKY
I had seen enough.
(beat)
Seeing you take punches in there,
brought back memories. Not so good
ones, you know?

38.
ADONIS
What was I doing wrong?
ROCKY
I don’t know...
(beat)
Off the top of my head... you can’t
lean on the ropes against a fighter
like that... tall like. You drop
your weight, and spin keeping him
close. Go right through him.
Adonis looks at Rocky for a long beat.
ADONIS
See... that’s what I’m talking
about... You’ve got all this
knowledge in there...
(points to Rocky’s head)
but you sell spaghetti? Walk around
here like a ghost?
Rocky looks down.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Mickey... he trained you right? And
my grandpa, and Duke? It’s selfish
of you not to give back. Especially
with us being like family.
ROCKY
Why you keep saying that, kid.
What?

ADONIS

ROCKY
Family... we just met.
ADONIS
But you and my grandpa was like
brothers right?
Rocky sighs.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
He died and left me with a bunch of
people that don’t get me. But I
think he would have. And I know you
do.
ROCKY
I don’t get you, kid. Boxings the
worst sport there is.
(MORE)

39.
ROCKY (CONT'D)
People slap you on the back,
telling ya how great you are, but
up them three steps... scariest
place in the world. Just you, and
another guy who wants to bury you.
You don’t want that to be your
life.
(beat)
It’s for people whose lives can’t
get no worse. People with no
choices.
(beat)
Just talking to you, I can tell
you’re smart. Ya got choices kid.
Adonis quickly moves closer to Rocky. Almost sizing him up.
ADONIS
Look at me.
Rocky postures a bit.
ROCKY
What are you talking about, I’m
looking at you.
ADONIS
Look in my eyes.
Adonis moves even closer, the two standing off, like two
fighters before a 12 round bout.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
You talk about choices. I made my
choice. I’m need this. Tell me you
don’t see it in my eyes.
They stare each other down for a beat. Adonis turns away.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
(without turning around)
Watch that tape, man...
He heads off down the street, leaving Rocky with his
thoughts.
59

INT. ROCKY’S HOUSE- BASEMENT

59

It’s what’s left of Rocky’s man- cave. Mostly a storage
space. Rocky sits on an old incline weight bench, in front of
the small television and VCR.

40.
We see that he is looking down at the tape that Adonis gave
him. He takes a deep breath, turns the television on and puts
the tape into the VCR.
ON THE SCREEN- Grainy footage of the televised first fight
between Apollo Creed and Rocky. The tape picks up the fight
between rounds, close- up footage
BACK TO ROCKY
Who looks at the footage, almost as if watching people he
doesn’t recognize. We hear the bell, and the round begins. A
subtle memory comes over his eyes. He stands up, parallel
with his younger self in the fight, and starts to mirror his
old movements...
60

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- NEXT MORNING

60

Sporino takes Leo through a weightlifting routine in the
corner of the gym. He looks up at the entrance and notices
Rocky, walking through the door. And people aklowledging his
presence.
Champ.

SPORINO

ROCKY
How ya doin.
The two embrace.
SPORINO
Didn’t know you were comin’ by.
ROCKY
Me either. Place looks okay.
SPORINO
Yeah I do what I can.
Sporino calls Leo over.
SPORNIO
Here’s my kid I was telling you
about. I don’t know if you guys
ever had a chance to meet, but he’s
the next big thing outta here.
(sotto voce)
Option’s still open, should you
want to get involved...
Leo and Rocky shake hands.

41.
ROCKY
How ya doin.
LEO
It’s an honor, champ.
Rocky spots Adonis stepping out of the dressing room, already
sweating from hours of training. He spots Rocky talking to
Sporino and Leo.
Unc.

ADONIS

Rocky lifts his head at Adonis. Sporino and Leo’s snap
around. Their jaws hit the floor.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
You made it.
ROCKY
Was in the neighborhood.
SPORINO
How do you know Hollywood?
ADONIS
It’s Donnie... And I’m a good
friend of the family.
SPORINO
You guys working together?
ADONIS
I don’t know...
(to Rocky)
Are we?
Rocky shrugs. An uncomfortable silence between the four of
them.
SPORINO
You guys let me know if you need
anything.
He and Leo head back over to the weights, staring at Rocky
and Adonis.
Rocky and Adonis start towards the bags.
ROCKY
You didn’t tell them who you are?
Adonis shakes his head.

42.
ADONIS
I don’t wanna go broadcasting that.
Keep it between us, you know.
Rocky nods.
ROCKY
So, you ready to roll?
61

TRAINING MONTAGE 1

61

A. Dawn- we see the dun rising in the mist, over the
industrial landscape of Philadelphia.
B. Schuykill River- Dawn. We see Adonis running along the
majestic river. Vapor expels from his mouth on this brisk
morning. We see Rocky watching from a vantage point along the
adjacent road. Behind him is the van.
ROCKY
Keep up the pace!!
As Adonis moves on, the city outline is seen looming before
him.
C. Int. Gym
Rocky is seen holding the bag as Adonis pounds away. Under
the music we can faintly hear Rocky giving instructions.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
A hundred a round.
Sporino looks on, as does Leo who shadow boxes in front of a
stained mirror.
D. Adonis has just completed wrapping his knees as he leaps
up from the floor to the 2nd step leading into the boxing
ring. He does this repetitively as Rocky keeps count.
E. Bianca’s Concert
Adonis stands in the front row, while Bianca rocks the crowd.
She eyes him as she performs.
F. Rocky Home
Rocky is again studying the old film of he and Apollo boxing.
It seems to re affirm his belief in Apollo and his grandson.
G. Int. Gym

43.
Rocky has Adonis performing an unusual task. Hitting the
heavy bag with his shoulders, no hands. Adonis is dripping
sweat.
H. Ext. Street- night
It is quite cold as Adonis runs through the deserted South
Philly marketplace. He passes by Rocky, who stands beside his
van.
I. Hogie shop- Night.
Adonis stands with Bianca as they have their cheese steak
dinner in the famous Pat’s Cheesesteaks. People watch as they
share bites of each other’s sandwiches and share a playful
kiss.
J. Int. Gym
Adonis is doing one arm pushups in the ring. People look on,
especially Sporino and Leo.
Time!

ROCKY (CONT’D)

ADONIS
When we gonna spar?
ROCKY
When ya ready,
K. Int. Bianca’s Apartment- night
The clock reads 4:15am as she looks out the window... down
below she sees Adonis getting into Rocky’s van and departing.
L. Ext. Deserted Backyard- Morning
Adonis looks at a pait of chickens standing nervously in
front of him and Rocky.
ADONIS
Man, seriously?
ROCKY
Old school- go!
Adonis starts after the fleeing chickens, and surprisingly
quickly snatches one up.
ADONIS
Old schools out!

44.
ROCKY
Chickens are slowing down...
62

INT. MICKEY’S GYM- TWO WEEKS LATER

62

Adonis, now wearing his gloves, throws the left jab against
weathered, horizontal heavy bag.
Rocky stands behind him, watching the impact of each punch.
The end of round bell sounds. Adonis sits down, trying to
catch his breath.
ROCKY
You rest on your feet.
He pops up as Sporino approaches Rocky.
SPORINO
Kid’s lookin’ good.
ROCKY
We got a ways to go...
Adonis walks over.
SPORINO
(to Adonis)
Whattya weigh right now?
180, why?

ADONIS

SPORINO
(to Rocky)
If he could get down to a buck 75
in a month, we might be able to put
something together
(to Adonis)
If you’re interested that is.
ADONIS
Hell yeah, I’m interestedROCKY
(to Adonis)
Hey, you do the fightin’ alright?
Rocky walks Sporino out of earshot of Adonis.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
You talkin about going up against
your kid?

45.
SPORINO
He could use a fight to keep warm.
And people will come out to see you
in the corner again. We could get
it done at the Blue Horizon. Make a
few bucks for everybody.
Rocky thinks on this.
ROCKY
I’m just starting to get used to
this kid being around, know what I
mean?
SPORINO
Yeah but he’s hungry. Let him eat.
Think about it, Rock. Lemmie know
by tomorrow.
Sporino pats Rocky on the shoulder and walks away.
63

EXT. MICKY’S GYM- DUSK
Adonis and Rocky, just finishing up their workouts, walk
towards Rocky’s van.
ADONIS
You don’t think I can beat him?
ROCKY
He fought golden gloves, open class
an won itADONIS
I fought a guy who won gloves in
Mexico.
You win?

ROCKY

ADONIS
Close enough...
(beat)
Things get rough in Mexico, trust
me. With you training me, I know I
can take this guy, Unc. Trust me.
(Italian Gangster voice)
Let me make you an offer you can’t
refuse.
Rocky shakes his head at this.

63

46.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
We take this match. And I got six
weeks to get in shape. I’ll do
whatever it takes, and if at the
end of six weeks, you don’t think
I’m ready: call it off.
Rocky scratches his head.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
I didn’t fly 3,000 miles from home
to play around. This is what I’m
here for. I’ll go 24/7 with this
shit. Matter of fact, we can stop
playing around, we can go to crib
throw all my stuff in the van right
now.
For what?

ROCKY

ADONIS
We can take it to your place.
That’s how camp is right? You live
with the trainer... old school.
Let’s go, right now.
ROCKY
Slow down. It’s been some time
since there’s been other people at
the house, since my Brother- In Law
passed away. Might be uncomfortble
for ya.
ADONIS
Is it haunted?
ROCKY
Course not.
ADONIS
I’ll be alright then, let’s roll.
64

EXT. ADONIS’ PHILADELPHIA APARTMENT

64

Rocky sits in the driver’s seat while Adonis loads the last
of his stuff into the back. He walks around the sidewalk and
looks up at Bianca, who sits in her second story bedroom
window watching him.
BIANCA
You sure you don’t need any help?
I’ll put these guns to use.

47.
She flexes her biceps. Adonis smiles and shakes his head.
Done now.

ADONIS

BIANCA
(sarcastiacally)
Darn.
Adonis knocks on the hood of the car. Getting Rocky’s
attention.
ADONIS
Come meet my... my neighbor.
Rocky gets out of the van and takes a look at Bianca.
ROCKY
How ya doin- somebody forgot to
gimmie ya name.
Rocky walks over to the sidewalk.
ADONIS
Bianca, this is my Uncle I was
telling you about.
Bianca squints her eyes at Rocky for a beat.
BIANCA
He’s White...
ROCKY
Yeah, there is that...
Bianca points at Rocky.
BIANCA
Holy shit... are you Rocky Balboa!
ROCKY
Yeah. Listen I’m just helpin’ him
out. Anytime you wanna drop in, if
he aint trainin it’ll be okay.
ADONIS
I’ll call you.
BIANCA
Yeah... I won’t hold my breath...
She flashes a smile, Rocky blows her a kiss, and does a phony
bow. Adonis throws her a peace sign.

48.
She playfully rolls her eyes and closes the window on him.
They jump in the van and blast off.
65

INT. ROCKY’S HOUSE- NIGHT

65

Adonis and Rocky move boxes into a vacant room. Rocky
struggles with one, grows tired and sits it down.
ROCKY
(rubs his back)
You don’t ever want a bad back.
I got it

ADONIS

Adonis picks up where Rocky left off. He comes out of the
room and sees photos and signs of Paulie everywhere. Old
booze bottles, bar signs, and vintage Playboys mags.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
This your brother- law’s room?
Rocky nods.
Paulie.

ROCKY

Adonis looks at the sagging bed.
ADONIS
Guess he spent alot of time in
here.
Adonis leaps on it, and stretches out.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Still comfy though.
66

EXT. PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAY

66

The sun rises over the city. A garbage man collects trash on
the street corner.
67

INT. ROCKY’S HOUSE- ADONIS’ ROOM- EARLY MORNING

67

Adonis sleeps in a bed in the spare bedroom. THE SPINNERS
plays from old record player speakers, pumped to the max.
Adonis snaps up and checks his phone: 3:45am. He looks up to
see Rocky, fully dressed singing and dancing along to the
music.

49.
68

EXT. ROCKY’S HOUSE- ASS CRACK OF DAWN

68

Rocky and Adonis walk up to the van.
ROCKY
I’m taking you to another gym in
North Philly. Tough joint. Very
difficult. They take no crap there.
Kinda what Apollo did with me.
Rocky gets in. Adonis tries the passenger side door and it
doesn’t open. Adonis knocks on the window, Rocky rolls it
down.
ADONIS
Can ya unlock the door?
ROCKY
You’re gonna run. I’m antique, so
I’ll just be drivin’ along side
keepin company.
ADONIS
How far away is the new gym?
ROCKY
Close enough.
He fires up the engine, and starts rolling down the street.
Adonis runs along side of him.
69

INT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- CONTINUOS

69

The gym is the roughest that we have seen so far. The GUYS
are already in there working.
We find Rocky introducing Adonis (who looks like he just ran
a marathon) to his team: JOE HAND III (50s, Black, Owns the
gym), AMIR HAND (20’s, Black, Joe’s Son same build as
Adonis), MARCEL (60s, HISPANIC, short and stocky, glasses).
They size Adonis up with excitement. Rocky points to Joe.
ROCKY
This is Joe. We go way back. Spared
a little, fought some of the best.
Got alotta knowledge in here.
Joe shakes hands with Adonis.
JOE
Champ told me a lot about you.
Excited to help get you ready.
(points to Marcel)
(MORE)

50.
JOE (CONT'D)
This is Marcel, the best cut man in
Philly.
(points to Amir)
And this my son, Amir, who’s gonna
be helping you out with sparring.
Adonis shakes hands with Marcel and Amir.
70

INT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- AN HOUR LATER

70

Rocky and Adonis work the hand bags, while Amir, Joe, and
Marcel look on. Adonis punches from a flamboyant stance,
hands low. Every so many punches, Rocky swings at Adonis’
head with the hand bags. But Adonis ducks and dodges out of
the way, leaving Rocky just missing him.
ROCKY
Hands up... Keep your hands up!
Rocky swings on him again, fast as he can, but still misses.
Adonis smiles. Rocky stops.
Amir.

ROCKY (CONT’D)

Amir jogs over.
Sup Rock?

AMIR

Rocky takes off the hand bags, and hands them to Amir. He
subtly leans forward to him.
ROCKY
I’m takin a break.
(sotto voce)
Yo, Make him keep his hands up,
know what I mean?
Amir nods. And walks over to Adonis.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Same drill, but forget gravity, and
keep em up, even higher.
They start. The pace of the drill is twice as fast as it was
with Rocky, then Amir swings, and WHAM! he catches Adonis in
the side of the face with the handbag.
Adonis cuts Amir a look.

51.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Hey! Nobody said stop and give
looks. Let’s go!
They start again, and WHAM! Adonis is caught again even
harder this time.
ADONIS
(threatening)
Watch my eye, bruh!
ROCKY
You supposed to watch your own eye.
Keep movin!
The drill starts again and after a few exchanges, Amir swings
once, Adonis ducks it but when he comes up he is caught by
another swing, SMACK right into his left eye.
Adonis explodes, and shoves Amir in his chest, sending him
back fifteen feet.
ADONIS
I told you homie! Take the gloves
off!
Adonis rips off his gloves and squares up with Amir, who
stares at him like he’s crazy.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Let’s go homie!
Amir looks at Rocky and at his Dad, and calmly takes the bags
off his hands. He hands them to Rocky.
AMIR
Call me when this dude is ready to
train, man.
Amir heads over to the other side of the gym.
Rocky pulls Adonis to the other side of the gym.
ROCKY
Yo, what the hell are you doing?
ADONIS
That dude is trying to take real
shots at me, I don’t play that
shit.

52.
ROCKY
Y’know, ya tell people stuff like,
don’t touch that fire, cause it
burns. And lo and behold, they do
it anyway. Guess what, some people
just gotta learn the hard way. Now
this Leo guy aint superman, but
he’s got fast combos that will
punch holes in ya face, if ya don’t
keep ya hands up!
Adonis takes this in.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Now go apologize to him.
Adonis looks off.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Apologize to him, now, or I walk.
Adonis takes a long beat, then begrudgingly walks over to
Amir.
ADONIS
My bad bro, I took a nasty butt to
my eye, never healed right.
AMIR
It’s all good, bro, happens to the
best of us. Just keep them jawns up
when you roll, like this.
Amir shows Adonis what he is talking about. Adonis mirrors
it.
AMIR (CONT’D)
And I’ll watch the eye.
JOE HAND
You two kiss and make up?
(beat)
Now back to work!
71

INT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- MOMENTS LATER
Series of shots with Rocky talking over them.
ROCKY
Keep reversing them gears- you keep
coming forward. Be outside, then
close the gap. Be ready to jump in
his pocket!

71

53.
Adonis shadow boxes with Amir, both wearing hand wraps. Angle
on their feet as they step, replace and pivot with large
rubber bands binding their ankles together.
Adonis hits the heavy bag.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Good, straighter. Work that Jab!
Every fighter must have a jab!
Stich and hook, catch a punch and
let a punch go, nail the guy...
Adonis spars with Amir
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Close that fist! Close it, good or
you’re slappin, and slappin don’t
cut it!
Adonis and Amir shadow box.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Everything is impossible without
footwork!!! In and out, side to
side, back and forth, it’s what
will take you in for the kill, and
take you out of trouble.
Adonis punches at the mirror, 5lb dumbbells in each hand.
Adonis works the heavy bag, throwing three jabs and then a
right. Rocky and Joe look on.
JOE HAND
Okay shape, damn fast hands. But I
don’t know what’s in here yet
(points at his chest)
Don’t know about that at all.
ROCKY
Only one way to find out about
that.
72

INT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- NIGHT- HOURS LATER

72

Joe, Amir, and Marcel head out, calling it a night. Rocky and
Adonis are still hard at work. Adonis throws punches at
Rocky, who wears focus mitts on each hand, and a body bag.
ROCKY
You gotta bring it back to protect!
Bring it back!

54.
The end of round buzzer goes off.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Nice, take a break.
Adonis is gassed. Rocky, starts to exit the ring, but starts
to feel sick. He goes over to the garbage can, and dry
heaves.
ADONIS
Unc, you alright?
ROCKY
I’m fine, keep working.
Adonis doesn’t. Rocky turns away from the can, and starts
back towards him and his leg seem to give out from under him.
Smack! He falls down to the ground.
Shit!

ADONIS

Adonis sprints over.
You okay?

ADONIS (CONT’D)

Rocky, pissed with himself, nods.
ROCKY
Yeah. Just a little dizzy. Comes
and goes, no big deal, really.
ADONIS
Naw man. That shit didn’t look
right, we’re going to the doctor.
ROCKY
The doctor for what?
Adonis helps Rocky to his feet with his free hand. Rocky
stands up, but his leg gives out again.
73

INT. PHILADELPHIA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

73

Rocky sits on the edge of the hospital bed in a gown. He
looks pissed off. Adonis leans up against the wall across
from him.
The door opens and DR. SHAHANI (mid 30s, Indian woman) walks
in holding a clipboard.

55.
DR. SHAHANI
Mr. Balboa! How are you feeling?
ROCKY
Nervous. When is the doc coming in?
Adonis makes a face like he’s about to see a car accident.
DR. SHAHANI
Actually, I am the doctor.
ROCKY
Sorry.
(to Adonis)
Doctors have changed.
She turns to Adonis.
DR. SHAHANI
And you are...
ADONIS
His nephew. I was just here to make
sure he didn’t sneak out of the
window before you showed up.
(beat)
I’ll be outside.
Dr. Shahani chuckles at this. Rocky doesn’t. Adonis leaves
the room.
DR. SHAHANI
So what brings you in to us?
ROCKY
Probably nothin- The kid saw me get
sick, and sorta fall a little.
Dr. Shahani nods at this.
DR. SHAHANI
Was that the first time you’ve
fallen?
Rocky shakes his head.
DR. SHAHANI (CONT’D)
Any other symptoms?
ROCKY
Get tired sometimes, but that’s
normal in life, right?

56.
DR. SHAHANI
Your appetite?
Rocky shakes his head.
ROCKY
Medium... I would say.
DR. SHAHANI
Well you have a history of head
trauma. And some of the symptoms
you describe are consistent with
dimentia pugilistica.
(off Rocky’s look)
But what has me worried is the loss
of appetite, and the vomiting. We
should run some tests.
ROCKY
I’m sure you got allotta people
really needin your help. I’m good,
really. You should check out
somebody else.
DR. SHAHANI
I believe we should do it now, just
to be on the safe side.
ROCKY
Gotta be fast, okay? Me and that
kid, we got allota work to do.
74

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- NEXT MORNING

74

Adonis sits in the waiting room asleep. Rocky walks in with a
slight limp (from the muscle biopsy). He wakes Adonis up.
ROCKY
All done kid. Let’s go.
Adonis pops up.
ADONIS
Shit. What time is it?
ROCKY
I don’t know...
ADONIS
We going home?
ROCKY
No, we’re going to the gym.

57.
They walk side by side, down the hospital hallway.
SUPER: FIGHT NIGHT AKBAR VS. JOHNSON
75

INT. BLUE HORIZON- CONTINUOUS

75

The air is electric in the packed house. Two welterweight
boxers move around in the ring. It is an intimately designed
space, with an upper level of rowdy fans, that seems to sit
right on top of the ring.
The crowd is mixed, mostly Black and Italian though, and
standing room only.
We reveal that we are looking at the gym from Adonis’ POV,
stares out beyond the door of his locker room.
One more.

ROCKY (O.S.)

Adonis turns back into76

INT. BLUE HORIZON- CHALLENGER LOCKER ROOM- CONTINUOUS
Adonis squares up with Rocky, who takes him through a
complicated series of combinations. Adonis nails them with
pinpoint accuracy. Joe, Amir, Marcel, and Bianca look on.
ROCKY
(to Adonis)
Listen, what you do here is
forever. It’s part of ya history.
You can’t change it, so use
everything I believe ya got. Keep
that jab constantly on him. Hit,
and not get hit. Joe, can ya warm
him up?
Joe hand steps forward with the focus mitts. Rocky glances
into the hallway and spots Sporino, who motions for him to
come and talk. As Rocky gets closer, we see Sporino looks
like the cat who ate the canary.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Whats going on?
SPORINO
I knew there had to be something
with this kid. I mean, I tried to
get you to come work with us for
years. And this Hollywood kid just
brings you out of the shadows?

76

58.
ROCKY
Whattaya gettin at?
SPORINO
I made some calls to LA. Aint no
Donnie Johnson. Kid’s name is
Adonis. Kid’s Creed’s blood.
Rocky sighs deeply.
SPORINO (CONT’D)
(smiling)
Fight just got big time...
ROCKY
Yo, the kids tryna make it on his
own name. Don’t tell anybody.
SPORINO
(without turning around)
Secret’s safe with me...
Rocky
77

INT. BLUE HORIZON- RING- CONTINUOUS

77

Adonis and Leo meet in the middle of the ring, the ref
between them, their corners behind them.
REFEREE
Touch em up!
Adonis touches gloves with Leo, and heads back to his corner.
Joe, Amir, and Marcel head out of the ring. Rocky turns back
to face Adonis, he grabs him by the face and pulls him close.
ROCKY
It’s you now okay? It’s all you,
this is what you’ve been waiting
for. I’m gonna be right here.
Adonis nods, intensely. Rocky steps out of the ring and looks
back.
Adonis turns around, and the SOUND of the crowd fades out for
a bit, while he looks and sees that only he, Leo, and the
referee remain in the ring. Leo looks at Adonis, bouncing,
looking relaxed and focused. DING! DING!
The NOISE of the stadium rushes back as the fighters head
towards each other, coming within arms reach right in the
middle of the ring. They stop and posture, Leo in perfect
stance.

59.
He throws the first punch, a stiff left jab, Adonis blocks it
and sends one back, Leo ducks it and catches Adonis clean
with two counters.
SPORINO
Nice! Nice!
Adonis quickly shakes off the hits and grabs him. The ref
comes in.
REFEREE
Alright, break it up, break it up.
The fighters back up, and then the Ref sends them back at
each other. Adonis bounces in on Leo, sends out a couple of
jabs. Leo blocks all of them, and sends a couple back at
Adonis, Adonis ducks the first few and tries to counter with
a left Jab, Leo slips it, and gets Adonis into the corner. He
begins sending shot after shot at Adonis. Adonis dodges a few
of them, and tries to do a hard slip to the right, when BLAM!
He is caught flush in the side of the head by a left hook
from Leo. Adonis is wobbled by this. The crowd explodes and
Leo raises his fists to show the crowd that he is about to
finish him off.
ROCKY
Tie him up, and bang him on the
ropes!
Adonis does just that.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
The body now! Touch the body!
Adonis jabs three times to work his way in. Leo throws a big
right, which Adonis slips beautifully, and drives a hard wide
left hook to the ribs. Leo emits an audible grunt of pain.
Leo is hurt, as he spins out, Adonis throws a five punch
combo as the bell rings.
78

INT. ADONIS’ CORNER- BLUE HORIZON RING- CONTINUOUS

78

Joe Hand flips the chair over for Adonis to sit down into it.
Adonis sits down and Rocky takes out his mouthpiece. Marcel
works on the right side of his face with an ice pack.
ADONIS
What do you think?
ROCKY
Very good, what do you think?

60.
ADONIS
I’m gonna move around a little.
Till my head clears.
ROCKY
I like what you’re doing. Get ya
senses back, then drop ya left
below his radar, and come up with a
shovel hook. If you see the openin,
park ya right on his chin. Your
grandfather dropped me with that
combo. Works very good.
Adonis nods. Rocky puts his mouthpiece back in and Adonis
stands up. The team jumps out of the ring. DING! DING!
Adonis punches his gloves together and takes off.
79

INT. RING- BLUE HORIZON

79

Adonis and Leo approach each other and begin to circling.
Adonis keeps his right hand cocked creeps up on Leo with more
patience.
Two quick jabs from Leo, but Adonis slips both of them. He
continues to creep in- patient, not bouncing like before. He
takes a quick jab at Leo, who sidesteps it and reverses his
footing, cornering Adonis. He sends rapid shots at Adonis,
who goes into defense mode, caging up. Leo fakes backing off,
and then comes in with a rapid fire combo. Adonis narrowly
slips the hard left of Leo.
Take it!

ROCKY

Adonis goes for the combo, dropping his left low, faking the
right, and brings up the shovel hook, driving Leo’s chin
upward, and BANG, a piledriving right lands with audible
force. Leo crumbles.
Adonis backs off, right hand still cocked as the Ref runs in
waving his hands, KO.
The ref waves his hands- TKO
Adonis quickly raises his hands and runs to the corner. Rocky
lifts his hands and runs into the ring.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Way to go, kid! That was something!
ADONIS
We got em, Unc. We got em.

61.
Leo’s team rushes into the ring to aid him. Sporino eyeing
Rocky.
80

INT. RINGSIDE SEATS- BLUE HORIZON

80

Bianca jumps out of her seat, rushes through the crowd, and
into the ring. She embraces Adonis, elated.
Leo comes back to his senses.
ADONIS
Whooo, let’s tear this city up!
81

INT. LIVING ROOM- ROCKY’S HOUSE

81

Adonis and Bianca sit on the couch next to Rocky watching
SKYFALL. All of them look super sleepy. Bowls of Ice Cream
are everywhere. Bianca leans on Adonis’ chest. Rocky does a
sleepy head droop, then stands up.
ROCKY
I’m gonna call it a night.
Congratulations, kid.
He walks down the hallway, and comes back with a blanket that
he places over Adonis and Bianca.
ADONIS
Thanks Unc.
ROCKY
No problem.
He goes to the back of the house. Bianca turns to Adonis. She
whispers.
Hey.

BIANCA

Adonis opens his eyes, and looks at Bianca.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
I made something for you.
Oh yeah?

ADONIS

Bianca nods.
BIANCA
Close your eyes.

62.
Adonis closes his eyes. And Bianca pulls out her headphones
and places them in his ears. Adonis smiles, tries to peek.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
Keep em closed.
She presses play on her phone and a Beautiful, Haunting Song
starts to play. We hear it as Adonis does, all encompassing.
Bianca’s voice starts. Adonis keeps his eyes closed affected
by this. Bianca watches him closely. Adonis opens his eyes.
And kisses her. She straddles him, keeping their faces close.
82

INT. ROCKY’S KITCHEN- NEXT MORNING

82

Rocky, Adonis and Bianca make breakfast together. The Local
News plays on the TV in the living room. On screen, we see a
newscaster standing in front of the Blue Horizon Gym.
LOCAL NEWSCASTER
Local boxing fans got a blast from
the past when Rocky Balboa made a
return the ring last night. This
time, as a trainer. Balboa was in
the corner of Adonis Johnson, an
otherwise unknown light heavyweight
middleweight, who defeated local
bronze medalist Leo Sporino, with a
second round TKO.
Bianca’s eyes grow wide with excitement, and she rushes into
the living room, followed by Rocky and Adonis.
LOCAL NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
But things took a dramatic twist on
reports that Johnson is the
biologic grandson of Apollo Creed
the late great heavyweight
champion, and close friend of Rocky
Balboa.
Bianca turns to Adonis, shock in her eyes. Adonis looks back
at her- busted. She heads back into the living room and grabs
her things.
Wait.

ADONIS

She heads out of the door. Rocky looks on at the news as
Adonis follows them out.

63.
83

EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY

83

Bianca walks briskly while Adonis tries to catch up.
ADONIS
Slow down...
She walks faster.
Hey.

ADONIS (CONT’D)

Adonis tries to grab her hand, but Bianca pulls away and
continues to walk. She goes to the corner and tries to catch
a cab. The cab pulls up, Adonis pushes past Bianca and closes
the door, telling the driver to take off.
Bianca tries to catch another one.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
BIANCA
Going home.
ADONIS
Why? What you trippin for?
BIANCA
Are you seriously asking me that?
(beat)
I made love to you last night...
and then I turn on the news and
find out you’ve been lying to me.
You have any idea how that makes me
feel? Do you even care?
ADONIS
I didn’t lie to you.
BIANCA
I distinctly remember asking why
you’re a fighter. That would have
been the perfect time to say, “You
know, I’m related to the most
famous boxer who ever lived...”
Adonis searches for an answer.
ADONIS
People look at me different when
they know. I didn’t want you
looking at me like that.

64.
BIANCA
I’m not people... I don’t care
about that kind of shit. I care
about you keeping it 100 with me.
ADONIS
Alright. From here on out, 100
percent honest and up front. Just
come back to the house with me.
Bianca rolls her eyes at this.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
I’m serious! On my grandfather’s
grave.
(beat)
We can start right now. Ask me
anything.
Anything?
Anything.

BIANCA
ADONIS

Bianca smiles. She can’t help but to be intrigued.
BIANCA
How many girls you been with before
me?
Adonis winces.
ADONIS
You’re different.
How?

BIANCA

ADONIS
Cause I want to be around you all
the time. I never felt like that
with anybody.
BIANCA
It’s cause it’s new.
ADONIS
But it doesn’t feel new. It’s like
I’ve known you forever. When I’m
close to you, it’s like I can do
anything.
Bianca crosses her arms, and looks off for a beat.

65.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Tell me you don’t feel the same
way. Tell me you don’t and I’ll
drive you home myself.
BIANCA
That’s passion, it’s infatuation.
That fades.
ADONIS
I can’t see that.
Why not?

BIANCA

ADONIS
Shit feels too right. You make me
want to work hard. Want to win.
BIANCA
So I’m just a good luck charm?
ADONIS
You could find an insult in a box
of roses, huh?
BIANCA
Naw, I just find the real.
(beat)
It’s cool though. Maybe you’re my
good luck charm too.
Bianca stares at him. She smiles.
What?

ADONIS

BIANCA
You do look like him.
Adonis quickly points at Bianca’s face, smiling.
ADONIS
See! I knew it!
Adonis quickly grabs her by her knees and lifts her up high
into the air inducing a playful shriek. Her phone buzzes. And
she answers it while Adonis is holding her.
BIANCA
(into phone)
Hello... Yeah this is she...
(to Adonis)
Put me down! Put me down!

66.
Adonis obliges. She puts her finger in her ear to hear the
phone better.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
Are you serious? Of course... Of
course... This is foreal, right?
Absolutely. Thank you so so much.
Bianca hangs the phone up, and takes off running at full
speed, screaming in joy. Adonis, confused, sprints after her.
ADONIS
What?! What’s going on?
She stops and bends over out of breath.
BIANCA
I got the gig... You’re looking at
the opening act!
Adonis screams at the top of his lungs. Bianca jumps onto his
waist.
A TRANSIENT MAN (White, 60s) stares at these two idiots like
they’ve lost their minds.

Rocky and Adonis work the hand bags. Adonis sends quick,
fluid jabs at Rocky’s hands and stomach. The buzzer goes off,
and Rocky stops, and rubs his sore hands.
A plastic kitchen timer goes off. And Adonis stops. Rocky
takes off his hand pads and resets the timer.
ROCKY
Relax. I’m on your side.
ADONIS
Everybody knows...
ROCKY
So what? You ashamed or something?

67.
ADONIS
I wanted this on my own.
ROCKY
Who’s in here punchin? Last time I
looked at you, you were on ya own.
Truthfully, I’m glad this happened.
Now everybody’ll be gunnin for you.

ROCKY
I don’t know how you got this
number but...
HOLIDAY
Easy, Stallion, it’s Niles
Holiday... I used to fight on your
undercards, but now represent Ricky
Porter.
ROCKY
Wow... Sorry about that... the
reporters... you know...
HOLIDAY
Yeah, I know how it is... Forgive
me for skipping the pleasantries...
is it true, about the kid?
(off Rocky’s silence)
What are you doing tomorrow?
ROCKY
We’re training.
HOLIDAY
Think you and the kid can spare 30
minutes for a business meeting?
87

INT. ADRIAN’S- DAY
Daylight streams into the back of the restaurant, that is
closed for business for the time being.

68.
Rocky Adonis, and Holiday sit around a table.
HOLIDAY
My guy has to fight within the next
12 months, and we’ve beaten
everybody. I’ve been at my wits end
trying to find somebody worthy of a
payday. Until I heard about you
two.
ADONIS
You want me to fight Porter?
Rocky cuts Adonis a look. Adonis mimes “what?” back at him.
Holiday observes this, and moves forward gingerly.
HOLIDAY
I think it could be a very smart
move.
ROCKY
I don’t know about that, we’re
still working on things.
HOLIDAY
Good. You were fighting pro fights
in Mexico, huh?
Yeah.

ADONIS

HOLIDAY
I got you with a record of 11-1-1
out there. Your victory over
Sporino’s kid puts you at 12-1.
Nobody needs to know those fights
were in some bloody hole in the
wall.
(beat)
I’m not saying it isn’t going to be
difficult to convince the board.
But my camp is in a special
position right now.
ROCKY
Curious. How’s your fighter feel
about this?
HOLIDAY
He’s thrilled about it. He likes
thinking out of the box, giving
people chances. You can relate, I’m
sure.
(beat)
(MORE)

69.
HOLIDAY (CONT'D)
I just want to make sure you two
are on board with this before we
put our weight behind it. We don’t
have time to muck about.
ADONIS
We’re game to goRocky holds up his hand. Adonis, frustrated stops talking.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
What you want me to sit in on the
meeting for if I can’t talk.
Talk.

ROCKY

ADONIS
How soon would this happen?
HOLIDAY
2 months, 3 max.
ADONIS
(to Rocky)
We can do this, right?
Not sure.

ROCKY

ADONIS
I think so.
ROCKY
Let’s not debate in front of this
man.
ADONIS
Look at this chance.
ROCKY
Chance to get broken. He’s here
cause to them you’re a sure thing,
sure victory.
Not true.

HOLIDAY

ROCKY
Course it is.
HOLIDAY
Okay let’s be up front. This could
be his last gig.
(MORE)

70.
HOLIDAY (CONT'D)
We gotta make it count.
(beat)
We’re talking about something the
whole boxing world would want to
see., we got the undisputed
champion of today, we got the Icon
in you
(motions to Rocky)
and we got the name of the best
fighter ever all in one event?
It’ll be bloody historic.
ROCKY
We’ll talk about it.
HOLIDAY
Sure, Champ. Take some time to
think on it.
(to Adonis)
In the mean time, if this thing’s
gonna go, I’m gonna need you to do
something on your end. We need you
to take on the “Creed” name,
formally.
ADONIS
I can’t do that. Not my name.
HOLIDAY
Then that’s a non- starter for us.
Without the name, there’s no fight.
Take a day to toss it around.
Holiday stands up as Rocky and Adonis exchange looks.
ADONIS
Can I get the day off?
ROCKY
I was gonna suggest the same thing.

Adonis and Bianca post- coital on Bianca’s air mattress.
Bianca takes pulls off a roach, while Adonis looks up at the
ceiling.

71.
BIANCA
Patriarchy drives me insane. We
carry the baby for nine months,
wreck our bodies, almost die
squeezing it out, only for society
to slap the baby on the ass and
name it after the man?
(beat)
The kid should at least get both
names.
ADONIS
Which one goes first?
Bianca cuts him a look that says 1,000 words. Adonis laughs
about this.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
So I’d be Creed- Johnson. And you’d
be...
BIANCA
Franklin- Taylor.
ADONIS
But if you got pregnant...
We

BIANCA

ADONIS
If we got pregnant, our kid’s last
name would be... Franklin- TaylorCreed- Johnson?
BIANCA
I didn’t think that far ahead...
but you need to get over this name
thing?
ADONIS
Can’t do it. Gotta make my own way.
BIANCA
You’ve got a funny way of showing
it. Weren’t Rocky and Apollo, like
best friends? Seems like you’re
trying to tap into whatever it is
he left behind.
(beat)
That’s nothing to be ashamed of,
right?
Adonis thinks about this for a beat. Then shakes his head.

72.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
What are you afraid of?
(beat)
I’ll start it off for you, “I’m
afraid of blank” Say it with me,
I’m afraid of....
Adonis looks at her, almost as if to see if he can trust her.
She looks back, waiting for his answer.
ADONIS
I’m afraid that...
(beat)
If I take the name on, and I loose.
They’ll say I’m a let down. And not
worthy of the name.
BIANCA
Who cares what people say.
ADONIS
You don’t know what it’s like.
BIANCA
I know what it’s like to be called
a fraud. An embarrassment.
Adonis looks over at her. She does understand.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
Don’t you think it’s weird, that I
do all these shows, and not once
have you seen my family there? My
parents aint 3,000 mi away. They’re
down the street.
Adonis thinks on this.
ADONIS
What’s they deal.
BIANCA
We Sunni, like everybody else out
here. But my parents is just mad
conservative. Once I started
performing, and doing the music
about life, they disowned me. Told
me I was destined to fail. My own
parents want to see me fail at what
I love to do.
Adonis thinks on this.

73.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
I never knew what it was like to
have somebody in the crowd that I
knew truly cared about me. Until
you started coming to my shows. It
changed everything for me.
ADONIS
It’s crazy that they wouldn’t
support you... I’ve seen you
sing...
BIANCA
And I’ve seen you fight. So what if
people don’t think you’re as great
as Apollo. Who was? Think about
what’s true. You love to box. It
makes you happy, right?
Adonis nods.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
And you are Apollo Creed’s grandson
right?
He nods again.
BIANCA (CONT’D)
Use the name. It’s yours. Fuck what
they say about you. I’ll be there
for you, win or loose. Rocky’ll be
there for you, win or loose. To
hell with everybody else.

INT. ADRIAN’S RESTAURANT- DAY

Rocky stands in the stock room looking over merchandise, the
back door is open to the parking lot. Through the door, we
see Adonis approach. He walks up to Rocky.
ADONIS
So what do you think?
ROCKY
Ya really care?
ADONIS
Yeah, what are your thoughts on
this.
ROCKY
Fighter’s only got ten good years,
tops.
(MORE)

74.
ROCKY (CONT'D)
Every battle takes something outta
ya, and trust me, this one could
take more than you’re willing to
give.
Adonis nods.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
But I can’t help but to think how
jumpin into the deep end of the
pool is how I got the best
oppertunities in my life. Chances
like this are one in a lifetime...
ADONIS
So what are you saying?
ROCKY
Let’s do it.
Adonis nods.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
One call and we’re in.
ADONIS
Make the call.
Rocky shrugs. Adonis looks at Rocky blankly for a beat, then
is overwhelmed with emotion and takes off running out the
door.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
(shouting)
I’M FIGHTING PRETTY RICKY
PORRRTERRRR!!!!
He jumps up and down and pumps his fist into the air. Rocky
looks on at this, smiling.

A HOUSEKEEPER brings the Wall St. Journal to Mary Anne, who
eats breakfast at the kitchen island. She opens it up and
flips to the front page. We see they have a photo of Adonis
smiling in an interview, right next to a photo of a young
Apollo in an article about the bizarre nature of the upcoming
title fight. Their resemblance is breathtaking.

Adonis is in the corner making a salad, while Bianca and
Rocky meal around in the Kitchen cooking.
Bianca checks on a pot bubbling on the stove, while Rocky
stirs a pot of tomato sauce.
ROCKY
I don’t know... I’ve had sweet
potatoes before.
BIANCA
Not like this, you haven’t.
Rocky smiles.
Bianca opens the stove and pulls out a large baking sheet,
foil covering it. She sits it down on the counter and peels
the foil back, revealing the orange dish.
ROCKY
Smells good.
Bianca dips a small spoon into it, blows on it, hands it to
Rocky, who eats it. His face says it all.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Tastes better.
Bianca smiles, as her cell phone rings. She answers it.
BIANCA
(brightly)
Hey... uh, yeah, give me a second.
She heads towards the front door, past Adonis who notices
something off in her voice. Adonis heads out after her.
Rocky looks on, then takes another bit of sweet potatoes.

Adonis looks at Bianca, who paces on the porch, wrapping up
what looks to be a very serious phone call.
ADONIS

BIANCA

tour managers in the country.
And...

ADONIS

BIANCA
He’s gonna be at the show tomorrow.
ADONIS
(beat)
That’s amazing, right?
BIANCA
It’s just... It just feels like
even more pressure.
ADONIS
Pressure’s good, it’s what you work
so hard for.
Bianca looks at Adonis for a beat, and smiles at him.

Come’on. I’m smelling that food you

won’t even shower.
BIANCA
Gross. I’ll disown you...
She gives him a hug, and a kiss.

She playfully shadow boxes the air, then heads out.

MARCEL
Hello... yeah... who is this? Okay
hold on.
Marcel heads over to the ring where Rocky watches Adonis work
out.
MARCEL (CONT’D)
Rock... its the hospital on the
phone.
This catches Adonis’ ear. Rocky looks around and sees
everyone’s concern. He heads over to the phone and picks it
up.

78.

Yeah.

ROCKY

DR. SHAHANI
Mr. Balboa, this is Dr. Shahaniwould you be able to stop by today?
What’s up?

ROCKY

DR. SHAHANI
It would actually be better if you
came in to talk with us in person.
Rocky looks over at his camp for a beat.
99

INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

99

Rocky, wearing street clothes, sits in the consultation room.
Dr. Shahani sits across from him.
DR. SHAHANI
Well, we went through your test
results. And the neurological tests
came back as I had expected. But
your MRI and blood tests came back
showing signs of Hodgekins
lymphoma.
ROCKY
What’s that do?
DR. SHAHANI
Well Hodgekins is a very rare form
of cancer.
Cancer?

ROCKY

DR. SHAHANI
The good news is, we caught while
there is still a chance... We’ll
have to remove the tumor in your
lymph nodes, and start chemotherapy
immediately.
Rocky takes all of this in for a beat, while Dr. Shahani
continues the prognosis. He stands up, grabs his coat.
ROCKY
Chemo- my wife tried that stuff.
Didn’t work out so good for her.

79.
DR. SHAHANI
Mr. Balboa... I’d like to go over
our options for treatment. Come up
with a plan of action.
ROCKY
Thanks, but I gotta go.
What?

DR. SHAHANI

ROCKY
Gotta go. I’m very busy, Dr.
DR. SHAHANI
Mr. Balboa, we caught this early
enough that with treatment, you
still have a very good chance of
recovery. Without it, you have less
than a 5% chance.
ROCKY
Got commitments. Can’t do it now.
Rocky puts his coat on, and opens the door.
DR. SHAHANI
Wait, at least take these. It has
information on your diagnosis, and
options for treatment...
Rocky turns and looks at her for a beat, while holding the
door open. He takes the pamphlets and heads out.

ADONIS

ROCKY

Adonis punches his gloves together, excited. Joe hands Rocky

Adonis go at it with the drill.

Rocky gets ready to head into the showers, towel around his
waist. He sits his clothes down on the bench and goes into
the shower area.
Adonis and Amir come into the locker room, laughing, but
exhausted. They go over to their perspective lockers. Adonis
looks down at Rocky’s coat, hanging on the hook- notices the
pamphlets sticking out.
He picks them up and starts to read them.
102

INT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- LOCKER ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

102

Rocky enters the room to get his jacket, and notices Adonis
waiting on him, staring him down.
ADONIS
This shit foreal?
He pulls out the pamphlets. Rocky snatches them from him and
throws them in the trash.
ROCKY
Don’t worry about that.
ADONIS
Don’t worry?! I thought you said
the tests came back good.
ROCKY
What does it matter how the tests
came back. You got Porter coming
up, and can’t afford to get
distracted.
ADONIS
To hell with Porter. When do you
start treatment?
ROCKY
I’m not doing no treatment.
What?

ADONIS

ROCKY
You wanted me with ya trainin ya,
and I appreciate that. But you
gotta live ya own life. Don’t worry
about mine, not at all.

81.
ADONIS
You don’t do the treatment, this
will kill you. You fine with that?
ROCKY
It’s alright!
ADONIS
What? How is it alright? Why would
anybody say that?
ROCKY
Cause dying is easy; Cause living
the way I do, is very hard.
ADONIS
What do you mean, living the way
you do?
ROCKY
Look around. Anybody who every
loved me, anybody who ever knew me,
is gone. Mickey, Apollo, Adrian,
Paulie, I got my son, who I haven’t
seen in years. It’s like I was
listening to some good song and it
ended before it was suppose to. And
I’m still dancin. I got nothing to
hang around for.
ADONIS
I’m still here...
ROCKY
So what? You just showed up! You
don’t know me! You’re just some
fighter, you’re not family to me.
This cuts Adonis deep. He takes off brushing past Rocky, who
watches him leave, then puts his face in his hands for a
beat. He then pushes the locker, open handed- HARD. Again,
and again.
103

EXT. JOE HAND BOXING GYM- DUSK

Adonis walks out of the gym, distraught. He puts his hands to

Shit! Shit!
He takes off running down the steps and hails a cab.

We open close on Bianca’s face. She’s looking off into the

Rihanna plays on stage as Adonis cuts through the sizeable
crowd towards the VIP section where we see Bianca and a few
other musicians standing by the large metal fold up chairs
behind metal fencing.
ADONIS
(screaming over the music)
Bianca! Bianca!
Bianca sees him, and looks at him for a beat, before turning
her back and disappearing deeper into the crowd. Two Security
Guards head over to the Adonis.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Say bro, my girl is back there.
SECURITY GUARD
No standing over here bro...
The Security Guard firmly pushes Adonis against his chest.
Adonis knocks his hand away. And looks towards where Bianca
disappeared to.

84.
He rushes the gate, in an attempt to get past the guards, and
one of them bear hugs Adonis across the neck. Adonis slips
out, and punches him in the nose, dropping him.
The Security Guard, his nose bleeding, picks up a folding
chair. More guards run over to Adonis, grabbing him and
punching him SMASH! One brings the folding chair right to the
side of Adonis’ face. Adonis falls as a guard pulls out
handcuffs.

Moonlight streams into the bedroom, where Rocky lies atop the

Rocky listens to the other end of the phone. He sighs deeply.

Adonis sits in a solitary holding cell looking through pale
bars. His face shows the signs of picking a fight with 2,000
lbs of security and a metal folding chair.
COP (O.S.)
Right over here...
He looks up towards the door as we hear the door buzz.
We cut to the reverse to see Rocky standing outside the bars,
with a COP (40’s, Italian American) who keys open the holding
cell. Rocky walks in and closes the door behind him.
Rocky walks over and sits down next to Adonis on the bench.
The two are silent for a beat. Rocky looks around at the
room.
ROCKY
They fixed this place up; use to be
just one big cell. Very crappy.
Maybe twenty upset guys in there at
the same time. It got tense in a
sense.
ADONIS
What are you doing here?

85.
ROCKY
I know a few people, they say your
friend’s downtown.
ADONIS
I’m not your friend. You’re just a
trainer to me, remember?
This stings Rocky a bit.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
You need to stay away from me man.
ROCKY
What are you talking about?
ADONIS
Something about me. I fuck
everything up.
ROCKY
Kid, that’s crazy talk.
ADONIS
It’s true. My mom don’t talk to my
grandma because of me. My dad got
locked up soon as I was born...
anybody who I ever get involved
with, I fucked their lives up.
Thought it’d be different out here.
Thought it’d be me you, and Bianca,
for years. Make our own family.
(beat)
It was never about one fight for
me. It was about 20 fights, 20
years, day in day out. Us living,
making memories. I never had that.
Rocky reaches out to pat Adonis on the shoulder.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Don’t touch me.
He knocks Rocky’s hand away.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Just leave, man.
Kid...

ROCKY

ADONIS
Get outta here!
(standing up)

86.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
Get your old cripple ass outta
here. We aint family. You let my
real family die.
This cuts Rocky to the core. Rocky stands up and stares
Adonis down for a beat. Then heads towards the bars.
ROCKY
You got so much anger inside, kid.
It makes you train hard. It makes
you fight hard in the ring. But
anger is poison. You can only run
on it for so long, before it
destroys you. But love... If you
fill your heart up with love, you
can fight forever. You’re too hard
on yourself. You got so much good
inside.
Rocky turns and walks out of the cell, while Adonis sits
alone, with only the sound of the bars slamming to comfort
him.

Adonis and Lisa walk and talk.
LISA
A part of me always knew this day
was coming.
(beat)
You got it honest.
Adonis looks at Lisa.
LISA (CONT’D)
I wanted to be a fighter too. I
think if daddy hadn’t had died, I
would definitely have gotten into
it.
Really?

ADONIS

She nods.
LISA
But I haven’t been able to watch a
match since.
Adonis takes this in.
ADONIS
Why didn’t you ever tell me that.

120

88.
LISA
Why do you think?
(beat)
So how bad is it, with Balboa?
ADONIS
If he gets chemo, he has a chace...
LISA
But he doesn’t want to...
Adonis nods. Lisa shakes her head.
LISA (CONT’D)
Of course not... That old macho
shit is what got Daddy killed. You
gotta talk to him.
ADONIS
I did. It was hard enough getting
him to go to the hospital and get
checked up.
LISA
You have to put it in terms that he
understands...
They stop.
LISA (CONT’D)
You talk to mom?
He shakes his head.
Have you?

ADONIS

She shakes hers.
LISA
Something we can agree on now, I
guess.
Adonis smiles.

Rocky sits at the dinner table, eating pasta and salad. He
looks up as Adonis enters the door and walks in. There is a
beat of silence between Rocky and Adonis.
Rocky gets up, and walks over to the cabinet and grabs a
bowl. He puts some salad into it, some pasta, and then sits
it down on the table. Adonis sits down and starts eating.
ADONIS
I’m not training if you don’t get
treatment.
ROCKY
Eat. You look like you lost five
pounds.
ADONIS
Can’t be taking orders from a
quitter. You can’t throw the towel
in to this cancer shit.
Rocky thinks on this.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
What makes this different than any
of your other fights?
(beat)
If I fight, you fight.
Rocky takes a long beat. And nods.
Adonis extends his closed fist towards Rocky. Rocky punches
it, and they eat.

over, and sees Adonis sitting in the corner looking back at
him.
Rocky stiffly sits up, and starts pulling at his IVs, as if
he’s trying to leave.
Adonis springs up.
ADONIS
Chill, chill, chill. It’s all good.
ROCKY
Did you get your workout in?
Adonis shakes his head.
I stayed.

ADONIS

Rocky feels at his neck. There is a large bandage on the side
of it.
ROCKY
They get it all?
ADONIS
I don’t know. They said they’ll
come and talk to us about it when
you wake up.
Rocky starts feeling around his bed again.

91.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Chill out man, what you looking
for.
ROCKY
Jacket... my jacket.
Adonis reaches over to the chairs and grabs Rocky’s coat. He
hands it to him. Rocky digs in it and pulls out his
stopwatch.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Let’s go, pushups, burpies, situps, shadow box super-sets.
(beat)
Let’s go!
Adonis looks at him like he’s fucking crazy.
ADONIS
Right here?
ROCKY
You think Porter aint working out
right now? You think he doesn’t
want to dismember you in front of
his people?
(beat)
Go!
BEEP. Rocky hits the stopwatch. Adonis obliges.

Adonis collapses while lifting bags of fertilizer. He stays
down on all fours for a beat, then gets back up, and lifts
it.
Rocky, having lost a bit of weight, wearing his hat, body
bag, and gloves stands in the ring with Adonis, working him
through blinding fast drills. Amir and Joe Hand, stand on
either side of Adonis, throwing punches that Adonis parrys.
Adonis jogs through North Philly. Several young black kids
come out, and follow him. A group of Dirt bike riders follow
suit, popping wheelies as a salute to Adonis. A young kid
drives up next to Adonis on a mini- bike. Adonis, nearing
the end of his route, takes off at full speed. The kid
smashes on the gas. And all of the dirt bikes and ATV’s catch
up and slow down to keep right along Adonis, who is sprinting
now. They arrive at the gym and the bikers circle around
Adonis, some even shadow box with him, others with each
other.

On screen, Porter is picking his opponent apart. The door
opens, and Dr. Shahani enters.
DR. SHAHANI
How are you feeling?
ROCKY
Worse body shots I ever tool. Don’t
recommend it, but thanks Doctor.
DR. SHAHANI
Well you should be feeling better

apart of the team! When do you guys
take off?

Adonis looks down at video, just in time to see Porter knock
his opponent out, cold.
Dr. Shahani walks Rocky out.
Hey Unc.

ADONIS

Rocky turns around.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
Think I can do this?
Rocky takes a long beat.
ROCKY
Yo you ever heard that story about
the guy who said, “I Can” and the
guy who said, “I Can’t”?
ADONIS
Naw, how’s it go.
ROCKY
They were both right.
Adonis smiles at this. Rocky heads out of the door.

ADONIS
I didn’t mean to let you down.

127

94.
BIANCA
What you meant to do don’t matter.
ADONIS
Look, Uncle Rock’s got cancer.
What?

BIANCA

ADONIS
I found out right before your show,
and I freaked out. It’s why I
didn’t make it in time.
BIANCA
Jesus. How bad is it?
ADONIS
It’s bad. Putting him through a
whole round of chemo, and
radiation.
(beat)
Tough son of a bitch is fighting,
still has every hair left on his
head.
Bianca shakes her head.
BIANCA
I’m sorry to hear that.
(beat)
Make sure you send him my love.
She starts to close the door.
B.

ADONIS

She stops.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
What do I gotta do? To get you to
forgive me.
BIANCA
It’s my fault for letting you in.
For putting so much in whether or
not you show up. I can’t forgive
myself for that. You’ve got alot
going on. And I’m gonna focus on
mine.

ADONIS
Bianca... open the door...
He sighs, and leans on it with his palms placed high. He
steps back and pulls an envelope out of his pocket. Then
slides it under the door.
ADONIS (CONT’D)
That’s everything you need to get
out to Liverpool in there. It would
mean a lot to me and Unc if you
could make it. But if not, promise
me you’ll at least watch.
He waits for an answer from the other side of the door, and
receives none. He heads off.

ROCKY
We gotta roll, kid. Plane aint

Adonis looks back to his phone.

Porter’s camp sits at he press conference table on one side,
while Rocky, and Adonis sit on the other.
Several reporters clamor for attention and have intense
questions for Adonis and Rocky.
REPORTER 1
Porter can we expect any more
fireworks at the weigh in?
PORTER
I’ve been doing a lot of anger
management. And learning how to
turn the other cheek, and whatnot.
HOLIDAY
I just gotta make sure he unlearns
all of this before Sunday morning.
The crowd laughs.
REPORTER 2
Balboa, there are rumors
circulating back in the states
about your health, some sources
saying that you have been diagnosed
with a serious health issue.
ROCKY
Yeah, it’s called ageing. Very
contagious, so watch out.
The crowd guffaws.
REPORTER 3
I here has been questions raised
about the odd nature of having a
5am start time, in order to
maximize pay per view profits in
the states. Could you both speak to
how that might affect you.

97.
Adonis looks at Porter, a bit unsure if he should go first.
ADONIS
If anything it’s an advantage for
me, because it’ll be normal fight
time where I’m from.
PORTER
It’s simple for me. 5 in the
morning is just as good a time for
an ass whoopin as any other.
Adonis leans over and mean mugs Porter, who isn’t even
looking at him.
REPORTER 4
What about the contrast between you
two, you the experience, the rags
to riches background, vs. Johnson’s
overnight success.
ADONIS
Well I wouldn’tPORTER
Everybody’s path is different. Some
people have it better than others.
My grandfather was a fisherman. His
grandpa was the heavyweight
champion of the world. Some people
get things handed to them, while
others have to earn it... Next
question.
The two fighters stare daggers at each other.
REPORTER
There’s a lot of talk about legacy
in this fight. Can you guys speak
to that.
Well-

ADONIS

PORTER
Legacy is an interesting term. I
feel that most great boxers have a
common one. We all come from the
struggle. Creed, Balboa, Porter.
I’m carrying that tradition better
than anybody. I’m the Rocky of this
generation. I’m the Creed. It’s
right here. Look no further. And
you won’t have to come fight night.

98.
Porter gets up, stares daggers at Adonis, and leaves.
134

INT. LIVERPOOL HOTEL- ADONIS’ ROOM

134

Adonis closed off, wearing headphones, shadow boxes into the
hotel mirror. A KNOCK! at the door. Adonis opens it, to find
Rocky outside holding a large white box. He passes it to
Adonis.
ADONIS
What’s this?
ROCKY
I don’t got X-Ray vision. Open it
up.
Adonis sits the box down atop the hotel bed. He quickly tears
it open. Adonis pulls out a pair of AMERICAN FLAG BOXING
SHORTS with an insignia that reads CREED..
ADONIS
Are these...
ROCKY
Your grandmother sent them to me,
before we left Philly. You’ll want
to try ‘em on. I had to get them
taken in quite a bit.
Adonis tosses them up and down in his hands. He notices a
white card inside the box, he pulls it out and we see that it
reads WIN in Mary Anne’s regal handwriting.
ROCKY (CONT’D)
Also, win or loose, I need you to
do me a favor when we get back to
Philly.
Anything.

ADONIS

ROCKY
You promise?
ADONIS
For sure. What’s up?
ROCKY
Don’t worry about it. Just wanted
to make sure we were locked in
before the fight. You might be mad
at me tomorrow, I don’t know.

99.
Adonis laughs.
ADONIS

I’m gonna go in there and try these
on...

ROCK
It’s your night kid. This is what
it’s all about.
They arrive at the ring. Adonis bounces. He looks out and the
reality of the size of the stadium sets in.
ADONIS’ POV FROM THE RING
40,000 screaming fans. The stadium is open up top, over the
ring. Clouds circle overhead- a modern day Roman Coliseum,
fit to feed gladiators to lions.
BACK TO SCENE
Rocky limps over to Adonis, places his hand on his shoulder.
ROCKY
You freaking out?
Yeah.

ADONIS

ROCKY
Very normal. First title fight, I
almost passed out.

Adonis and Porter in the middle of the ring, alone, the
REFEREE pulls them in. He talks in a thick Scouse accent.

Watch the hits below the belt, make
sure you guys honor my commands,
honor each other. We’ll make it a
good fight, make it a hard fight,
sound good?
Both fighters nod.
REFEREE (CONT’D)
Go’on and touch em’ up.
PORTER
Nice shorts. Too bad your grandpa
ain't here to fight for ya. I’m
gonna send you home, boy.
Adonis’ eyes tighten in anger. Before he can respond Porter
sprints back to his corner. Adonis retreats to his.
ROCKY
Move your feet! Use the jab to keep
him off of you!
Adonis nods, the sound of the stadium fades out. DING DING.
The fight begins.
Porter closes the gap on Adonis at a near sprint, he’s fast,
and quickly sends two jabs at Adonis’ body, both connect.
Adonis tries to counter, but Porter parries, and steps,
pinning Adonis against the ropes. He goes to the body again
then swings a hook, that Adonis ducks and then grabs him.
PORTER
Don’t hold on too tight ol’ boy.
I’m just getting started.
The Referee breaks up the hold.

106.
PORTER (CONT’D)
Come here mate. A little closer so
you can learn a thing or two..
Adonis moves in slowly, when WHAM!, a lightning fast jab
lands flush. Adonis stumbles, but before he can regain his
balance Porter sends a left hook, Adonis ducks just in time.
He pops an uppercut to Porter’s body, but Porter blocks and
slams Adonis with two more jabs before he knows what hit him.
THE “10 SECOND CLAPS” SOUND as Adonis retreats, but Porter
cuts him off, and sends a barrage of punches at Adonis’ head.
Adonis blocks most but when the round dings, but Porter slams
him across the face with a left hook.
ROCKY
C’mon, that’s after the bell!
The Ref signals that it was simultaneous. Adonis’ corner is
furious.

while the guys work on him.

but you’re still just watching.
Okay? Don’t watch, take the fight

Holiday pours water into Porter’s mouth. The rest of the team
isn’t doing much, because “Pretty” Ricky is still just thatAdonis hasn’t so much as touched him.

INT. RING- ANFIELD STADIUM- CONTINUOUS

166

The fighters approach each other quickly. Adonis dodges a
couple punches then cages up, putting his hands over his face
and body to protect.
Porter pounds Adonis’ body. A hard left connects with Adonis’
ribs, causing Adonis’ mouthpiece to pop out. A thunderous
right hook connects with Adonis’ jaw. Sending his mouthpiece
flying. He fakes the left hook, then hits Adonis with a right
hook over the eye, opening his stitches.
ANNOUNCER
Johnson is hurt.
The ref slides in to save Adonis, and he stumbles over to
grab his mouthpiece and replace it.
ANNOUNCER 2
Johnson is saved by loosing his
mouthpiece. He looks to be out on
his feet.
ANNOUNCER
That gash above his left eye is
leaking. Look for Porter to start
attacking that side.
Adonis smiles at Porter.
ADONIS
Let’s go! Is that all you’ve got?
Let’s go!
PORTER
(smiling back)
I got plenty more.
The ref gives them the clear sign.

108.
Porter approaches, Adonis sways, like a cobra. He drops his
hands, Ali style, baiting. Porter comes in, WHAM! Adonis
sends a lightning fast jab that slips between Porter’s hands

look forward to. And I’m gonna go
