INT. POLICE STATION, BOSTON - NIGHT, 1976
A quiet, cold winter night. An OLDER COP emerges from an
INTERVIEW ROOM, walks down a long hall.
Boston, MA - December, 1976
He reaches the front desk. A YOUNG COP looks to him,
curious, as he lights a cigarette.
YOUNG COP
How’s that going?
OLDER COP
The mother’s bawling and the uncle’s
pissed off.
YOUNG COP
She’s not married?
OLDER COP
Divorced with four kids. I guess
Father was helping out.
YOUNG COP
Helping out?
The Older Cop shrugs. The front door opens and BURKE, FRESH
FACED, 32, walks in. He wears a dark overcoat.
OLDER COP
Hey, Mr. Burke. They’re in the back
talking to the Bishop.
BURKE
And Father?
The Older Cop nods in the other direction.
OLDER COP
We put him in the break room.
Any press?

BURKE

OLDER COP
Some guy from the Citizen, but we
sent him away. None of the big
papers.
BURKE
Let’s keep it that way.
Burke walks toward the interview room.

YOUNG COP
(off Burke)
Who’s that?
OLDER COP
Assistant DA.
YOUNG COP
Gonna be hard to keep the papers
away from the arraignment.
OLDER COP
What arraignment?
He’s matter of fact. The young cop reacts, looks towards the
PRIEST (GEOGHAN) sitting in the break room.
OLDER COP (O.C.) (CONT’D)
You can tell Father Geoghan it won’t
be much longer.

A BISHOP, 50s, talks in hushed tones with SHEILA, 33.
BOYS, 7 and 9, sit coloring.

BISHOP
Sheila, you know what good work the
church does in the community. I
give you my personal guarantee that
I’m going to take Father out of the
parish and this will never happen
again.
Burke enters, eyes Sheila nervously fingering ROSARY BEADS.
BISHOP (CONT’D)
We’ll just be another moment, Paul.
BURKE
Of course, Father.
The Bishop turns back to Sheila.

Burke eyes the kids.

BISHOP (O.C.)
Now Sheila, I’m going to give you my
personal card...

INT. BOSTON GLOBE, NEWSROOM - DAY, 2001
A large newsroom.

REPORTERS and EDITORS gathered.
Boston, MA - July, 2001

DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR BEN BRADLEE JR., 50s, gruff, stands in
front with an older reporter, STEWART, 60s. And a cake.
BEN
Losing good reporters, it’s tough.
And losing one of our best... well
to put it as eloquently as I can,
it’s a real kick in the ass.
A few polite chuckles from those in the crowd.
BEN (CONT’D)
But Robby’s known Stewart longer
than most of you have been alive so
I’m gonna turn it over to him.
Robby?
Ben looks to WALTER ‘ROBBY’ ROBINSON, 55, Boston Everyman.
ROBBY
Thanks, Ben. I think. And although
I take issue with the reference to
my seniority, I will say Stewart’s
departure is especially painful for
me. You see, for... what? 20 years
now, Stewart’s been more than
willing to part with his money at
the poker table...
(Laughter)
And I got a kid in college.
More laughter.
STEWART
Yeah, but I’m gonna keep playing.

11/26/14

ROBBY
Problem solved. Godspeed, buddy.
Everyone’s laughing now.

Robby connects in a warm, easy way.

ROBBY (CONT’D)
Now, Stewart, I find the timing of
your departure a bit disconcerting.
The corner office sits empty, the
new editor arrives on Monday, so
forgive me, buddy, but I gotta
ask... what the hell do you know?
The room hoots and laughs. Stewart covers his mouth. Speak
no evil. More laughter takes us to...

SACHA PFEIFFER, 28, wholesome, no bullshit, and MATT CARROLL,

They emerge on the floor below, Sacha eating her cake.
MATT
How’s the cake?
SACHA
It’s really good.

Saving yours?

MATT
Nah, it’s for Mike. I can never eat
at those things. They kind of
depress me.
SACHA
I know.
(taking a bite)
You see the numbers from Washington?
Yeah.

MATT
Very interesting.

SACHA
I think so too.
They walk into -8

CRAMPED OFFICE. Small windows. MIKE REZENDES, late 30s,
good looks, so-so haircut, sits at his UNHOLY MESS of a desk.

5.

MIKE (INTO PHONE)
Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Dan, I
talked to my guy at Justice, I know
you guys have been dropping cases...
(then)
Look, Dan, I’m not asking if the
PD’s lying, I know they are. All
I’m asking is who’s behind it?
Matt sets the cake by Mike, sits at a desk full of FAMILY
PHOTOS. Sacha checks messages at a tidy desk, full of books.
MIKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
I get it. You don’t want to talk.
(listens)
I’m not mad, Dan, I’m hungry. We’ve
been talking so long, I missed
lunch. So I’m going to go eat,
which gives you an hour to decide if
you want to be on the right side of
this or read about it in the paper
like everyone else.
Mike hangs up the phone, digs into the cake.
SACHA
You think Cahill’s got something?
MIKE
Maybe, I just don’t think this
story’s for us.
MATT
Ben likes it.
MIKE
Yeah, it’s not bad, it’s just not
Spotlight.
Robby enters.
ROBBY
What’s just not Spotlight?
SACHA

Oh.

MIKE

No. But I will.

ROBBY
Then we’ll know if it’s thin.

Robby goes into his office, bit of an edge to him.
MIKE
How’d it go upstairs?
Okay.

MATT
Robby gave a good speech.

SACHA
I heard Lubin and Connor are going
to the Times.
MATTY
Come on, really?

MIKE
Yeah, I heard the same thing.

MATT
They’re leeching us.
MIKE
At least they’re sending us a guy
from Miami to run things. That
should help.
MATT
Has Baron even spent time in Boston?
MIKE
I don’t think he’s ever been here
before. Maybe we should buy him a
map.
SACHA
I have a friend down at the Herald,
said Baron cut 15% of the staff.
Great.

MATT

Mike rolls his chair back, calls out to Robby in his office.
MIKE
Hey Robby, the new boss coming in to
make cuts?
ROBBY
I have no idea.
MIKE
Aren’t you sitting down with him?
Robby looks up, fucking Rezendes, always snooping.

11/26/14

Yes, I am.

ROBBY

MIKE
You think it’s about Spotlight?
ROBBY
I don’t know, Mike, but I do know
Ben needs an answer on the crime
numbers story.
MIKE
I’m telling you, I really don’t
think that story’s for us.
ROBBY
So you did get Cahill to talk then?
Mike, annoyed, wheels back to his desk, picks up his phone...

INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, RESTAURANT - LATER

Marty sits at a table reading “The Curse of the Bambino,” a
NOTEPAD beside him.
Mr. Baron.

ROBBY

Marty looks up and rises to greet Robby.
ROBBY (CONT’D)
Walter Robinson. Robby.
MARTY
Thanks for taking time out of your
weekend, Robby.
ROBBY
My pleasure.
(they sit)
What are you reading?
Marty holds up a book.
MARTY
‘The Curse of the Bambino.’
ROBBY
(sitting)
That’s a great book. The Globe has
season tickets at Fenway, once you
settle in.

11/26/14
MARTY
Thank you. Uh, to be honest, I’m
not much of a baseball fan. I’m
just trying to get a feel for city.
Are you originally from Boston?
ROBBY
I am, born and raised. A lot of the
newsroom is from here. It really
feels like a local paper in that
way.
MARTY
And did that change at all after the
paper was sold to the Times?
ROBBY
No. I don’t think that had a big
impact.
MARTY
Good.
(then)
So, you’re an editor for, uh, the
Spotlight team?
ROBBY
I prefer to think of myself as more
of a player-coach. But yes. Are
you familiar with Spotlight?
No.

MARTY
Not particularly.

ROBBY
Well, we’re a four person
investigative team. We report to
Ben Bradlee Jr. and we keep our work
confidential.
MARTY
What are you working on now?
ROBBY
We just put out a piece on this
shoddy construction outfit and right
now we’re trolling around for our
next story.
MARTY
How long does that typically take?
ROBBY
Hard to say. A couple of months.

8.

11/26/14

9.

MARTY
A couple of months.
ROBBY
Yeah, we don’t like to rush it.
Once we settle on a project, we can
spend a year or more investigating
it.
Marty jots down some notes.

Robby sees he’s writing a lot.

ROBBY (CONT’D)
Is that a concern?
MARTY
Not necessarily. Uh, but from what
I understand readership is down, the
Internet is cutting into the
Classified business and, uh, I
think, uh, I’m going to have to take
a hard look at things.
ROBBY
So you anticipate more cuts?
MARTY
I would assume so, yes, but what I’m
more focused on right now is finding
a way to make this paper essential
to its readers.
ROBBY
I’d like to think it already is.
MARTY
Fair enough. I just think we can do
better.

Hey. Saw the email on the PD

Yeah.

ROBBY
There’s something there.

BEN
How much longer you need?
ROBBY
Another week.
BEN
(realizing)
Where are you going?
ROBBY
To the 10:30.
You?

BEN
Since when?

ROBBY
Technically, I am an editor.
BEN
Technically. Your sit-down with
Baron go that well?
ROBBY
I couldn’t get a read on him.
BEN
That’s a first.
ROBBY
How ‘bout you?

Editors around a horseshoe table, side seats filled. It’s

editor HELEN DONOVAN, 50s, to either side. Robby sits off to
the side, WATCHING.
HELEN DONOVAN
Morning everyone. Let’s get started.
Do you want to say something, Marty?

11/26/14

11.

MARTY
Uh, sure.
(to the group)
Hello. As most of you know by now,
my name is Marty Baron, I’m
delighted to be here. If you can
tell me your name as we go around,
that would be helpful.
Marty looks back to his notes.
Okay.

HELEN DONONVAN
Peter?

Ben nods to METRO EDITOR PETER CANELLOS, 40s.
CANELLOS
Peter Canellos, Metro. We’ve got a
major Big Dig closure that’s just
been scheduled for early August...
Marty makes notes.

Crappy game last night.

KURKJIAN
They can’t hit worth a nickle.
Mike looks toward the conference room of editors.
MIKE
What’s Eileen McNamara doing in the
10:30?
KURKJIAN
Do you need something, Mike?
No.

MIKE
Just curious.

KURKJIAN
I got work to do. Go be curious
somewhere else, will you?

...and it looks like Pedro’s gonna
be out until September 1st. Jimmy
says he’ll be back this year, but
the doc didn’t seem so sure.
BEN
When’s the Pats opener?
Laughter.

Except Marty.
MARTY
Is that everyone?
HELEN
Yes, that’s it.
MARTY
Great, thank you. Uh, did everyone
read Eileen McNamara’s column this
weekend?

The room reacts. Huh?

Editors look at EILEEN MCNAMARA, 50s.

HELEN
That’s the Geoghan case?
MARTY
Yes, what’s the folo on that?
BEN
It’s a column, what kind of folo
were you thinking?
MARTY
Well, apparently this priest
molested kids in six different
parishes over the last thirty years
and the attorney for the victims,
Mr...
EILEEN
Garabedian.
MARTY
Thanks, Eileen. Mr. Garabedian says
Cardinal Law found out about it
fifteen years ago and did nothing.
CANELLOS
I think that attorney’s a bit of a
crank. And the Church dismissed the
claim.

11/26/14

13.

EILEEN
He said, she said.
MARTY
Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or
not, he says he has documents that
prove the Cardinal knew.
BEN
As I understand it, those documents
are under seal.
Silence.

No one knows what to do.

Robby watches.

MARTY
Okay, but the fact remains, we have
a Boston priest abused 80 kids,
we’ve got a lawyer who says he has
proof Law knew about it, and we’ve
written all of...
(checking his notes)
...two stories on this in the last
six months?
(then)
This strikes me as an essential
story for a local paper. At the
very least, we should be going after
those documents.
CANELLOS
How would you like to do that?
MARTY
Well, I don’t know what the laws are
here, but in Florida we would go to
court.
Robby raises an eyebrow.

In fact, the whole room does.

BEN
You want to sue the church?
MARTY
Technically we wouldn’t sue the
Church. We would file a motion to
lift the seal on those documents.
BEN
The church will read that as us
suing them. So will everybody else.
MARTY
Good to know.

Knock. Knock. Mike’s at the door.
Hey.

Mike shuts the door, looks at Robby.

MIKE
He wants to sue the church?
great.

That’s

BEN
We covered Geoghan when the story
broke three years ago. Baron was
still in Miami.

I think he was at the Times then.
BEN
He wasn’t here.
MIKE
You think the suit has a chance?

Depends on the judge.

Jon Albano?
Yeah.

Tough.

Why’s that?

Good Catholic girl.
Marty pushes on.

16.

MARTY
Judging from what I’ve read, it
doesn’t seem like we’ve done a
thorough investigation of the
Geoghan case. Is that right?
BEN
No it’s not. We looked hard at
Geoghan. David Armstrong for Metro
and Michael Paulson for Religion.
Marty isn’t impressed.
MARTY
Okay, but, uh, just so I understand,
beyond our daily coverage, we
haven’t committed any long term
investigative resources to the
question of whether or not Cardinal
Law knew about this?
BEN
No, we haven’t.
MARTY
(to Robby)
And that’s the kind of thing your
team does?
ROBBY
Spotlight? Well, yeah, but we’re
still prospecting the Boston PD
story I told you about.
MARTY
Could you set it aside?
We could.

ROBBY

BEN
Marty, in the past, Spotlight has
had success in large part because
they pick their own projects.
MARTY
Would you consider picking this one?

ROBBY
Okay. Baron wants us to scrub the
Geoghan case.

That’s great.

There’s a lawyer alleging Cardinal
Law knew about it.

Can you get to him?
SACHA
I only interviewed him once.

MIKE
I like characters.

He’s

I’ll take him.

ROBBY
He’s yours. Also, we should talk to
the lawyer who repped the victims in
the Porter case. Eric MacLeish.
MATT
That guy was always on TV.
SACHA
The Porter case?

Remind me?

MIKE
Father Porter, similar story,
molested dozens of kids in Fall
River about ten years ago.
MATT
So we’re dropping the Boston PD?

11/26/14

18.

MIKE
I vote yes.
ROBBY
No, we’re just setting it aside for
now. I don’t need to tell you guys,
we need to be more discreet than
usual. Everybody’s gonna be
interested in this, not just the
Herald. I don’t want the Chancery
getting wind of this before we know
what we have.
MATT
Good luck with that.

Thanks, Tom. Will do.

How are you, Marty? Settling in?
MARTY
Yes, I think so.
GILMAN
Good. What can I do for you?
MARTY
I’d like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.
GILMAN
You want to sue the Catholic Church?

MARTY
We’re just filing a motion. But yes.
GILMAN
You think it’s that important?
Yes.

MARTY
I do.

GILMAN
Because, obviously, the Church will
fight us very hard on this. Which
won’t go unnoticed by our subscriber
base. 53% of them are Catholic.
MARTY
Uh, I think they’ll be interested.
Gilman considers for a long moment, looks unsettled.
Okay.

GILMAN

Marty nods, gets up to go.
GILMAN (CONT’D)
Marty? Lake Street will probably
contact you about a face to face

Good to see you again, Eric.

Sacha

ERIC MACLEISH
Nice to meet you. Do you play golf?
SACHA
(caught off guard)
Uh, no.
ERIC MACLEISH
Good. Your colleague took some money
off me at a charity event last year.
ROBBY
Lucky putt. I actually had my eyes
closed.
MacLeish smiles.

Chummy.

ERIC MACLEISH
So, how can I help you?
ROBBY
You’re familiar with the Geoghan
case?
ERIC MACLEISH
Sure. Eighty plaintiffs. All
individual cases, Garabedian must be
swimming.
ROBBY
And the allegations against Cardinal
Law?
MacLeish considers the question.
ERIC MACLEISH
Look, it’s tricky. You need to
understand these are shitty cases.
The statute of limitations is only 3
years and most of these victims
don’t come forward until long after
that.
SACHA
Why is that?

11/26/14

23.

ERIC MACLEISH
They’re kids. Shame. Guilt. And
they come from tough neighborhoods,
nobody wants to admit this kind of
thing. So you’re screwed on the
time limit and even if you argue
your way around that, the charitable
immunity statute caps damages at
twenty grand.
SACHA
Twenty grand for molesting a child?
ERIC MACLEISH
That’s the way the system works.
The Church is tough. So your best
shot is to try these cases in the
press like I did on Porter. But
most victims want nothing to do with
being on TV. And Mitch isn’t
exactly a people person.
ROBBY
So if Garabedian can’t get these
victims to talk to the press...
ERIC MACLEISH
Then he has a long road ahead of
him. My guess? He doesn’t have
anything on Law.
SACHA
You think he’s bluffing?
ERIC MACLEISH
I think he’s grandstanding to cut a
better deal.
ROBBY
Seems a bit reckless.
ERIC MACLEISH
Have you met Mitch Garabedian?

shakes her head, walks off screen. Mike watches her go.
Then, impatient, he stands, walks into --

INT. GARABEDIAN’S OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

24.

A small boardroom. MITCHELL GARABEDIAN, thin, 50s, sits at a
table buried in paperwork. He’s abrasive, to say the least.
Hi.

MIKE

GARABEDIAN
Who are you?
MIKE
Mike Rezendes from the Boston Globe.
I had an appointment with you about
an hour ago.
GARABEDIAN
I can’t talk to you, I’m very busy.
(calling to reception)
Sharon?!
MIKE
Sharon went out for coffee, she said
she’d be right back, I’m following
up on an article...
GARABEDIAN
The one in the Phoenix?
MIKE
No. In the Globe.
GARABEDIAN
Did you see the one in the Phoenix?
MIKE
No, I didn’t.
GARABEDIAN
I thought it was very good. I have a
copy here somewhere.
He starts to dig through the heap of papers.
MIKE
That’s okay. I’ll track it down. I’m
actually following up on a column
that Eileen McNamara wrote for the
Globe about your suit.
GARABEDIAN
Suits. There are eighty-four of
them, it’s not a class action. You
should get your facts straight.

11/26/14
True to word.

Garabedian is a bit of crank.

MIKE
You’re right. I should. I’m just
trying to get some background
information on the Geoghan case...
GARABEDIAN
You’re not recording this are you?
MIKE
No, I wouldn’t do that without
asking.
GARABEDIAN
(brusque)
I can’t show you the Church
documents if that’s what you’re
after, they’re under seal.
MIKE
I know that.
GARABEDIAN
Do you know they’ve tried to bring
me before the Massachusetts Board of
Bar Overseers three times? They’re
watching me very closely.
MIKE
The Church?
GARABEDIAN
Yes, the Church. They’d like to get
me disbarred. In fact, put that
away.
(off Mike’s pad)
Put it away! I don’t want you
recording this in any way, shape or
form. Not on paper, not on tape,
nothing. In fact, I probably
shouldn’t even be speaking to you.
MIKE
Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there
are things you can’t tell me. But I
also know that there’s a story here.
And I think it’s an important story.
GARABEDIAN
I already talked to the Phoenix.

25.

11/26/14

26.

MIKE
Yeah, and there’s a reason I didn’t
see it, nobody reads the Phoenix
anymore. They’re broke, they don’t
have any power. The Globe does.
And if we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.
GARABEDIAN
The Church thinks in centuries, Mr.
Rezendes. You think your paper has
the resources to take that on?
MIKE
Yeah, I do. But if you don’t mind
me asking, do you?
Mike’s question is non-threatening, but Garabedian reacts.
He stands, walking Mike to the door...
GARABEDIAN
I don’t have the time to talk to
you, Mr. Rezendes, I’m very busy.
(calling out)
Sharon!
But before he can push Mike out the door, Mike turns back -MIKE
Can I at least talk to some of your
clients? The victims? I’d like to
do that.
GARABEDIAN
Call me tomorrow. I need to think
about it.

WANDA
I got more clips from the library.
MATT
Leave ‘em right there.
Wanda the intern unloads them beside Matt’s desk.
WANDA
You guys doing a story on the
Church?
MATT
No. We are not doing a story on the
Church.
Wanda blanches, leaves.

Robby pours some coffee.

SACHA
Matt, you find anything on this guy
Phil Saviano?
No.

MATT
Who is he?

SACHA
He’s part of a victims’
organization. Kurkjian ran a story
on him just after the Porter case.
ROBBY
There’s a victims’ organization?
SACHA
Yeah, it’s called SNAP, Survivors
Network of those Abused by Priests.
MATT
Crummy acronym.

SACHA
You want me to track him down?
ROBBY
Yeah. Bring him in. How much longer
do you need to get through the
clips?
SACHA
A few days. There’s a lot and
Lisa’s still sending stuff up.
of it is on Porter.

MATT
Hey guys... I think I got another
priest.
Robby and Sacha turn.

Matt stares down at a clip.

MATT (CONT’D)
Liam Barrett. Molested some kids in
Philly then was moved to Boston, did
the same thing then was moved again.
Really?

SACHA
Sounds like Geoghan.

ROBBY
Is that one of our clips?
MATT
Yeah. Byline’s Diego Ribadeneira,
1997. Must’ve been back when he was
working religion.
ROBBY
Was there any folo?
MATT
Not much. One short piece. Looks
like the Church settled the case.
(then)
Don’t you know Jim Sullivan?
Yeah, why?

ROBBY

MATT
Looks like the Church brought him in
to help out.
Matt shows Robby the clip.

Robby reads, surprised.

BEN
Jesus. Has anybody but Manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?
Matt, who’s been scoring the game, checks.
MATT

Nope.

MIKE
I don’t know why you bother with
that thing.
MATT
It distracts me from the game.
KURKJIAN
Know what else is good for that?
Kurkjian holds up an empty beer cup.
MATT
Good idea. My round.
Anybody want food?
Hot dog.
Matt heads off.

Matt stands.

I’ll be back.

MIKE

Ben grabs some peanuts, turns to Mike.

BEN
You guys making any progress?
MIKE
Absolutely. It’s a good story.
BEN
Why? Cause you’re another lapsed
Catholic pissed off at the Church?
MIKE
We’ve got some good stuff.

Mike glances over at Kurkjian.
KURKJIAN
I’m just watching the game.

Omerta.

MIKE
We got another priest, Liam Barrett.
KURKJIAN
We reported on him.
(off Mike’s look)
We did, I’m just saying.
MIKE
Okay, but the guy was shuffled from
parish to parish every few years,
just like Geoghan and Porter. I
think there’s a pattern.
Ben looks at Kurkjian, who’s not impressed.
BEN
Sounds thin. What else you got?
MIKE
Sacha found this guy from a victims’
organization, Phil Saviano.
From SNAP?
him too.

KURKJIAN
Oh boy.

We reported on

MIKE
I thought you were watching the
game, Steve?
KURKJIAN
That guy’s pretty banged up, Mike.
BEN
We ran a couple stories on him, the
guy would not stop writing letters.
KURKJIAN
He wants a holy war.
MIKE
So he’s not worth taking to?
BEN
Where are you on Garabedian?
MIKE
I’m working on it.

BEN
Robby said MacLeish thinks he’s

JIM SULLIVAN, 50s, lines up a tee shot. Smacks it. ROBBY
and TWO OTHER GOLFERS watch as Jim talks to his ball...
JIM
Stay away from that trap.
ROBBY
You couldn’t reach that trap in a
million years, partner.
One of the other golfers (PAUL) tees up his ball.
JIM
I’ve reached that trap before.
Yeah.

ROBBY
Now Paul, maybe.

The group laughs.

How we doing?
ROBBY
We’re good. We’re two up.
JIM
Good.
(then)
How’s the new editor working out?

11/26/14
ROBBY
Well, he doesn’t like baseball.
he seems like a smart guy.

32.

But

JIM
Yeah, I just read an article about
him. Said he’s the first Jewish
editor at the Globe.
ROBBY
Must have been a slow news day.
JIM
He got a family?
ROBBY
No, he’s not married.
Divorced?

JIM

ROBBY
Don’t think so.
JIM
So the new editor of the Boston
Globe is an unmarried man of the
Jewish faith who hates baseball?
Robby half smiles, shrugs.
JIM (CONT’D)
They should have given it to Ben.
He’s a Bradlee for crying out loud.
ROBBY
He didn’t raise his hand fast
enough.
(then)
By the way, I was reading about this
priest, Father Barrett. Said you
were involved in the case.
Jim reacts, surprised.
JIM
Barrett, yeah. Bad egg. Lake
Street asked for help, I pitched in.
ROBBY
The victim said Cardinal Law knew
about Barrett when he came from
Philly.

33.

JIM
You know I can’t talk about the
case, Robby.
ROBBY
Off the record?
JIM
Off the record, I can’t talk about
it. Is this related to the lawsuit?
Now Robby hides his surprise.

He stops.

ROBBY
You heard about that?
JIM
Look, I don’t know this guy Baron or
what his agenda is and frankly I
don’t care, I just don’t want you
taking a bullet for him.
Jim heads off toward his ball.

Off Robby, processing.

INT. BARBARA’S CAR, WOLLASTON PARKING LOT - LATER
Robby gets in. She pulls off.
BARBARA
How’d you play?
ROBBY
Not too bad. Shoulda left my putter
at home.
BARBARA
How’s Jimmy?
Good.

ROBBY
He brought up the suit.

Really?

BARBARA
What’d he say?

ROBBY
He was thrilled about it.
BARBARA
It’s not a surprise, Robby. The
Church does a lot a good in this

Robby nods, but something about that doesn’t sit right.

Sunday mass. Full house. A PRIEST mid homily. In back, FIND
Sacha, her husband, HANSI, and her GRANDMOTHER.
PRIEST
Now as a priest, I admit, this makes
me a little nervous. Should I be
worried about job security?
Sacha watches her grandmother laugh with the congregation.

CONGREGANTS milling outside a church.

Hey.

MIKE
Shouldn’t you be golfing?

Robby looks up.

Mike’s in the door, towel around his neck.

ROBBY
Golfing’s not a verb. And I
couldn’t get a tee time today.
MIKE
Is that what they call it?
time?

A tee

ROBBY
They also call it a leisure
activity. You should try it, Mike.
MIKE

I run.

ROBBY
You run to work.
Mike shrugs, true.

He eyes the clips on Robby’s desk.

MIKE
So what are you doing here today?
ROBBY
Looking at clips.

On Saviano.

MIKE
Ben and Steve think he’s a dead end.
They gave me a bunch of crap about
it at the game.
ROBBY
Yeah, Ben emailed me.
He did?
Yeah.

MIKE

ROBBY
He said we should let it go.

MIKE
What do you wanna do?
ROBBY
Bring Saviano in.
MIKE
So just ignore those guys?

11/26/14

36.

ROBBY
I think we have to start ignoring
everybody on this one.
MIKE
I’m good with that.
(then)
You think Baron has any idea what’s
coming down the Pike?
No.

ROBBY
I don’t think he cares either.

That’s refreshing.
Yeah.

INT. LAKE STREET, CARDINAL LAW’S PRIVATE STUDY - DAY
Mahogany bookshelves, leather furniture. CARDINAL LAW,
large, 50s, wears a collar and sits across from Marty.
CARDINAL LAW
I used to sit in on lectures with
the Nieman fellows when I was at
Harvard.
MARTY
I, uh, read you were an editor once.
Law chuckles.
CARDINAL LAW
Yes. A very long time ago. The
Mississippi Register. Small,
diocesan newspaper, but for a 30year-old pastor it was a big
responsibility. Too much at times.
How so?

MARTY

48

11/26/14

37.

CARDINAL LAW
I was close with the Evers brothers,
we took a stand on civil rights.
Our readership was not pleased.
They saw me as a meddling outsider.
MARTY
I can imagine.
CARDINAL LAW
Tough seat to sit in, especially in
a small town. I think you’ll find
Boston’s a small town too, Marty, in
many ways. But if I can be of any
help, don’t hesitate to ask. I find
that this city flourishes when its
great institutions work together.
MARTY
Uh, thank you. Personally I’m of
the opinion that for the paper to
best perform its function it needs
to, uh, stand alone.
Law reacts, surprised -- the rebuff almost feels unwarranted.
CARDINAL LAW
Of course, but my offer stands.
A KNOCK on the door.
Come in.

CARDINAL LAW (CONT’D)

A SECRETARY slips in with a WRAPPED GIFT.
CARDINAL LAW (CONT’D)
Oh. Thank you, Maureen. A little
gift, Marty. Think of it as A

Okay, just a minute.
The guard picks up the phone, calls upstairs.

INT. GLOBE, ROBBY’S OFFICE - DAY

The entire team sits in Robby’s small sitting area facing
PHIL SAVIANO. Phil is mid-40s, thin and twitchy. He’s got a
medium sized BOX in front if him. He rifles through some
papers on his lap.
SAVIANO
So am I the first survivor you’ve
talked to?
ROBBY
Yes, Phil. You are.
SAVIANO
Okay, well, first of all, let me say
thank you for having me in today. I
want you to know that you have the
full cooperation of my organization,
SNAP.
SACHA
How many members are there in your
organization, Phil?
SAVIANO
We had eleven at our last chapter
meeting. No ten. Karen just moved.
ROBBY
There was a woman in your group?
SAVIANO
Of course there was a woman. They
don’t discriminate, not when it
comes to abuse. And this has
nothing to do with being gay. What
this is, is priests using the collar
to rape kids. Kids. Boys and girls.
He reaches into a file, pulls a PHOTO of himself as a kid.

11/26/14
SAVIANO (CONT’D)
I was eleven. I was preyed upon by
Father David Holley in Worcester.
And I don’t mean prayed for. I mean
preyed upon. Are any of you
Catholic?
The whole team looks at each other. Good question.
MATT
I was raised Catholic but now I go
to my wife’s Presbyterian church.
SACHA
I’m lapsed but I go to church with
my grandmother sometimes.
ROBBY
It’s safe to say we were all raised
Catholic but now...
MIKE
Not so much.
SAVIANO
Okay. Well, let me tell you, when
you’re a poor kid from a poor
family, religion counts for a lot.
And when a priest pays attention to
you it’s a big deal. He asks you to
collect the hymnals or take out the
trash, you feel special. It’s like
God asking for help. And maybe it’s
a little weird when he tells you a
dirty joke but now you got a secret
together so you go along. Then he
shows you a porno mag, and you go
along. And you go along, and you go
along, until one day he asks you to
jerk him off or give him a blow job.
And so you go along with that too.
Because you feel trapped. Because
he has groomed you. How do you say
no to God, right?
This lands.
SAVIANO (CONT’D)
See, it’s important to understand
that this is not just physical
abuse, it’s spiritual abuse too.
When priest does this to you, he
robs you of your faith.

SAVIANO (CONT’D)
So you reach for the bottle or the
needle or if those don’t work, you
jump off a bridge. That’s why we
call ourselves survivors.
The team stares, gobsmacked.

Phil pulls a book from the box.

SAVIANO (CONT’D)
Have you read Jason Berry’s book?
He wrote about the Gauthe case in
Louisiana?
ROBBY
We’re not familiar.

SACHA
That’s G-U...

SAVIANO (CONT’D)
G-A-U-T-H-E. And talk to Richard
Sipe. He worked in one of the
Church’s ‘treatment’ centers, he’s
an ex-priest, married a nun.
(pulling out a file)
Here, this is his testimony from the
Kos case.
SACHA
Phil, what’s a treatment center?
SAVIANO
It’s where they send priests when
they get caught. This is all right
here in the box, I sent it all to
you guys five years ago.
ROBBY
To the Globe? Who’d you send it to?
SAVIANO
I don’t wanna say who, but they said
they weren’t interested.
MATT
But Phil, we did run a couple of
stories on you. I saw them in the
clips.
SAVIANO
Yeah but to be completely frank, it
wasn’t enough!
Robby and Mike trade a look as Phil takes a PACKET out of the
box overflowing with tattered clips, articles and data CDs.

11/26/14

41.

SAVIANO (CONT’D)
You guys gotta understand, this is
big. It’s not just Boston, it’s the
whole country, the whole world. And
it goes right up to the Vatican.
MIKE
Do you have any proof of that, Phil?
SAVIANO
No, not yet, but think about it,
there are so many of them, how else
could they have hidden it for so
long?
MIKE
So many what?
SAVIANO
Priests! I know of thirteen right
here in Boston.
ROBBY
You know of thirteen priests who
have molested children in Boston?
SAVIANO
Yeah. Why do you keep repeating
everything I say?
ROBBY
I just like to clarify things.
SAVIANO
Maybe you should have clarified it
five years ago when I sent you all
this stuff! It’s all right here.
Phil’s sudden anger catches the room off guard.

Yeah. Sure, Phil. Come on.

ROBBY
He’s got an agenda, that’s for sure.
You think?

MIKE

SACHA
He’s obviously been through a
lot.

SACHA
But he’s smart and if he’s right
about thirteen priests...
ROBBY
Might be a big ‘if’ with this guy.
(then to Sacha)
Run background on him and follow up
with some of the other survivors in
his group.
MIKE
I’ll track down this ex-priest Sipe.
ROBBY
Okay. But stay on Garabedian,

Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?

SACHA

He stands, almost knocking over his coffee. He starts to
straighten the messy table, clean the crumbs all over it.
Shoot.

JOE CROWLEY
Sorry.

SACHA
No, that’s okay, no problem.

JOE CROWLEY
Uh... please sit. Is this table
okay? I had a muffin while I was
waiting. Two actually. I eat when
I’m nervous.
SACHA

McSorley isn’t having it.
MIKE
How old were you?

When it happened.

PATRICK MCSORLEY
I was twelve. My dad had just
killed himself.
Jeez.

MIKE

PATRICK MCSORLEY
He was a real piece of shit. And my
mom, she wasn’t so stable to begin
with.
MIKE
What do mean?
PATRICK MCSORLEY
I mean she was nuts.

Same shit.

GARABEDIAN
She was schizophrenic.

PATRICK MCSORLEY

MIKE
So how did you meet Geoghan?
PATRICK MCSORLEY
My sister saw him in the Dunkin’
Donuts. She tells him about my old
man and he rushed right over.
Patrick nervously itches at his arm as we CUT TO -58

JOE CROWLEY
...and there was this nun, Sister
Barbara, she ran this group for kids
from troubled families.
SACHA
Where was that?

11/26/14
JOE CROWLEY
St. Ambrose in Dorchester. She’s
the one who introduced me to Father
Shanley. He was a street priest,
long hair, very hip. He invited me
to his apartment in Back Bay.
SACHA
Where in Back Bay?
JOE CROWLEY
Beacon Street. Are you from here?
SACHA
I grew up in Ohio but my mom’s from
Southie.
JOE CROWLEY
So you get it. I’d never even been
to Back Bay.
SACHA
What happened on that first visit?
JOE CROWLEY
Well, he was very nice at first,
very casual, very funny. And I
think he could tell I was gay
because he showed me this mobile he
had, like over a baby’s crib? But
with different words. Homosexual,
bisexual, transsexual...
SACHA
Did you know you were gay at the
time, Joe?
JOE CROWLEY
Yes, but that wasn’t information I
was sharing with anybody. Not in
Dorchester.
SACHA
Right. So, what happened when he
showed you the mobile?
JOE CROWLEY
Well, I was a little freaked out and
I guess he could tell so he said,
you know what will help is if we
play strip poker. Of course I lost.
And things went on from there.

11/26/14

48.

SACHA
What happened specifically?
JOE CROWLEY
Specifically, he molested me.
SASHA
Joe, I think the language here is
going to be very important. We
can’t sanitize this, just saying
molest isn’t enough. People need to
know what actually happened.
Joe sits back, getting it as the waiter serves two coffees.
JOE CROWLEY
Maybe we should get these to go.

thrilled. I mean this was like God
showing up, you know?
Sure.

MIKE
So what happened then?

PATRICK MCSORLEY
You really want to hear this shit?
MIKE
Yeah, Patrick. I do.
Patrick is struggling a bit.

But he continues.

PATRICK MCSORLEY
He offers to take me to get ice
cream. He’s a priest, I’m a kid, so
I go.
Sure.

MIKE

PATRICK MCSORLEY
So we’re driving home and he starts
patting my leg and then... his hand
just slides up and he grabs my dick.
I just froze up, I was fucking
petrified. I couldn’t move. I
didn’t know what to do, I was just a
little kid.

He said it was a way to make me more
comfortable with my body.
SACHA
And what happened next.
JOE CROWLEY
...he took off his clothes and said
I’ve been depressed, maybe you can
cheer me up and give me a blow job.
Classy guy.
SACHA
And did you?
JOE CROWLEY
Yeah. I know what you must be
thinking, why I would ever do that
with some creepy guy thirty years
older than me. But you have to
understand, this was the first time
in my life that someone told me it
was okay to be gay. And he was a
priest.
SACHA
So you had oral sex.
intercourse as well?

Did you have

11/26/14

50.

JOE CROWLEY
Yes. Not then, but later. It
really messed me up. I’m sober now
but that was the beginning of it
all. It’s very confusing, you know,
to be introduced to sex like that
and then to be attracted to men...
Joe tears up a bit.

He stops, wipes his eyes.

JOE CROWLEY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I knew I was gonna
do this. I’m sorry.

SACHA
Don’t be sorry. It’s okay,
Joe. It’s okay.

Joe notices the kids on the church playground.
JOE CROWLEY (CONT’D)
And of course there’s a church right
here. And a playground.
Joe laughs nervously.
SACHA
Joe, did you ever tell anyone?
JOE CROWLEY
Like who, a priest?

McSorley nods in thanks.

Then turns to Mike.

You can use my name if you want.

I’m good, thanks. Listen, Joe,
there’s one thing that I wanted to
follow up on. You talked to Phil
Saviano about all this, right?
JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)
Yeah. I went to a couple SNAP
meetings.
SACHA (INTO PHONE)
Right. And did Phil ever suggest
doing anything about it?
JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)
No. The meetings weren’t really
about that. I mean, a couple of
them had gone to a lawyer but I
didn’t think it was worth it.

Why not?

JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)
There were so many forms to fill

Who said that?

The lawyer.
SACHA (INTO PHONE)
So you did go to see a lawyer?
Sacha takes out her pen, starts taking notes.
JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)
Yeah, but I didn’t end up using him,
so I didn’t think it was important.
I’m sorry. I’m not trying to hide
anything.
SACHA (INTO PHONE)
No, I know, Joe. Do you remember
his name? The lawyer?
JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)
No. But maybe Phil would know. The
guy was on TV a lot during the

It’s early.

The presses are relatively quiet.

And guys like Geoghan go after boys
not cause they prefer them, but
cause they’re more ashamed, less
likely to talk. These guys are
predators, Robby. Sipe says he saw
dozens of them at Seton in the 60’s.
He called it a “a phenomenon.”
ROBBY
Why didn’t he go public?
MIKE
He did, but the church has made a
huge effort to discredit him. Smear
campaigns, public statements by
prominent bishops. It’s just like
Saviano said. And Garabedian.

Come

SACHA
We understand you’ve settled several
cases against each of them.
ERIC MACLEISH
Even if I’d been involved in those
cases, the settlements would be
confidential. I could be disbarred
for acknowledging their existence.
Robby’s not backing down.

MacLeish shakes his head.

ERIC MACLEISH (CONT’D)
Look, I told you, these are tough
cases. Most of these folks just
want some acknowledgement of what
happened. We got them a sit-down
with the bishop and a little dough.
It was the best they could hope for.
ROBBY
It was certainly the best the priest
could hope for.
ERIC MACLEISH
No, the Church promised to take the
priests out of circulation.
ROBBY
And did you follow up on that?
ERIC MACLEISH
(done with this)
You guys need anything else?
SACHA
Yes. Why aren’t there any records?
I was just down at the courthouse,
why aren’t there any records of
these settlements?
MacLeish pauses.

Hesitant, now not so sure of himself.

ERIC MACLEISH
We dealt directly with the Church.
We’d draw up a demand letter and
we’d send it to the chancery.

SACHA
You never filed anything in court?
ERIC MACLEISH
It was a private mediation.
So that’s a no.

Jesus.

Sacha and Robby react.

ROBBY
So this is just you and the
archdiocese’s lawyers in a room?
Correct.

ERIC MACLEISH

Anyone else?
ERIC MACLEISH
Occasionally, the Church would bring
in another defense attorney to help
out.

No. No I don’t.

INT. GLOBE, SPOTLIGHT - LATE AFTERNOON
Ben sits with the gang.
BEN
So this was all under the table?
SACHA
There’s no paper trail at all. The
victim has to sign a confidentiality
agreement to get the settlement.
The lawyer takes his third and the
Church sweeps it under the rug.
Jeez.

MIKE
It’s a freakin’ racket.

BEN
It’s more complicated than that.
MacLeish has got a duty to his
clients to get the best deal he can.

73

11/26/14

64.

SACHA
Sure, but how many victims do you
represent and profit from before you
say something?
MIKE
Garabedian would say none. That’s
why he’s taking these cases to
court. Because he wants people to
know about this.
SACHA
I agree. And, legal ethics aside,
Ben, operating the way MacLeish has
all but guarantees the abuse stays
under wraps.
BEN
Yeah.
(then)
Did MacLeish confirm all of
Saviano’s priests?
ROBBY
No. He’s limited by the
confidentiality agreement.
SACHA
But he’s clearly settled cases
against a number of them. Phil’s
put me in touch with some of the
other victims, I’m pretty confident
all of his priests are going to
check out.

So it’s thirteen priests?
Yeah.

Wanna beer?

ROBBY

Jim nods to the bartender.
JIM
You here with Barbara?
No.

ROBBY
She hates these things.

JIM
Karen too. Smart ladies.
The bartender sets down two beers.
Sláinte.

Robby hands one to Jim.

ROBBY

JIM
I just met your new editor, seems
like a decent fella.
ROBBY
I think he is.
(then)
I had an interesting conversation
with Eric MacLeish yesterday. Turns
out he’s been settling abuse cases
with the archdiocese for years.
JIM
You really wanna talk about this
here?
ROBBY
You said you helped out on Father
Barrett as a favor, that was a oneoff?
Jim doesn’t say anything.

Robby DARKENS.

ROBBY (CONT’D)
How many of these cases have you
been involved with, Jim?
JIM
You know I can’t answer that, Robby.
It’s unethical.

ROBBY
Is that all it is?
Jim stares Robby down.

He drinks.

JIM
So this is the Robby Robinson I’ve
always heard about but never met.
ROBBY
Listen to me, Jimmy. You want to be
on the right side of this.
JIM
You’re talking about the Church,
Robby. Look around. These are good
people who’ve done a lot of good for
this city.
(then)
Enjoy the party.
Jim smiles, heads into the party, leaving Robby alone at the
bar. Robby glances over at Marty, still on the edge of the
party. So this is what it feels like to be on the outside...

INT. GLOBE, ROBBY’S OFFICE - DAY

78

Matt, Sacha and Mike are crammed in Robby’s office, Matt
downloading the team on the directories.
MATT
I’ve been through a lot of these.
‘Sick leave’ isn’t the only
designation they use when they take
one of these priests out of
circulation. They use a slew of
terms - ‘absent on leave,’
‘unassigned,’ ‘emergency response.’
MIKE
They got a name for everything,
these guys.
SACHA
Except rape.
A phone rings in the Spotlight office.

Mike exits to get it.

MATT
And they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests. When
I was a kid, a priest moved after
seven or eight years. These guys,
it’s two to three tops.

11/26/14

71.

SACHA
Did they use these designations for
all of Saviano’s priests?
Yeah.

MATT
It’s a pretty clear pattern.

As Robby considers this, Mike calls from Spotlight -MIKE
Guys, I’ve got Sipe.
79

INT. GLOBE, SPOTLIGHT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The team is HUDDLED around a SPEAKERPHONE.
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
I think if you want to understand
the crisis, you need to start with
the celibacy requirement. That was
my first major finding: only 50% of
the clergy are celibate.
They share a look.

50%?

Can that be true?

SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE) (CONT’D)
Now, most of them are having sex
with other adults. But this creates
a culture of secrecy, that tolerates
and even protects pedophiles.
SACHA
So you believe the church is aware
of the extent of this ‘crisis?’
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
Absolutely. After the first major
scandal in Louisiana, Tom Doyle, the
Secretary Canonist for the Papal
Nuncio, coauthored a report warning
pedophile priests were a billiondollar liability. That was in 1985.
1985?

MIKE

SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
That’s right.
MIKE
Who saw this document? Anyone in
the Catholic hierarchy?

79

11/26/14

72.

SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
Sure. Doyle tried to introduce the
report at the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops. In fact, Cardinal
Law initially helped to fund the
report, but then he backed out and
they shelved it.
REZENDEZ
(to Sacha and Matt)
Are you kidding me?
ROBBY
Richard, Robby here. We think we
have thirteen priests in Boston that
fit this pattern, which would be a
very big story. Does that sound
right to you? In terms of scale?
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
No. Not really. It sounds low. My
estimates suggest six percent act
out sexually with minors.
MIKE
Six percent of what?
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
Six percent of all priests.
Holy shit.

Robby turns to the team.
ROBBY
How many priests do we have in
Boston?
MATT
About fifteen hundred. One percent
is fifteen... six percent is ninety.

ROBBY
Ninety priests?

SACHA
Is that possible?

SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
From a metric standpoint, that would
be in line with my findings.
The team looks at each other.

Ninety fucking priests?

Ben’s shocked.

In Boston?

ROBBY
That’s what he said.
BEN
If there were ninety of these
bastards people would know.
MIKE
Maybe they do.
BEN
And no one said a thing?
MIKE
Good Germans?
BEN
I don’t think that’s a comparison
you want to make publicly.
ROBBY
MacLeish knew and said nothing.
BEN
That’s thirteen priests, big
difference between thirteen and
ninety. Where’s this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?
MIKE
He’s studied this for thirty years,
he’s a trained psychotherapist -BEN
Okay, but we need something more
than a metric from some hippy expriest who’s shacking up with a nun.
MIKE
So we’ll track down more victims,
we’ll get more priests. Then we can
check them against the directories.
BEN
That’s a shitload of victims.

11/26/14

74.

MIKE
We’ll get them.
BEN
How long’s it gonna take?
Mike shrugs.

Robby considers.

Too long.

Robby walks through the newsroom.

Mike catches up to him.

MIKE
What do you got?
ROBBY
What if we work backwards?
MIKE
What do you mean?

From what?

ROBBY
The directories. We’ve been using
them to confirm bad priests. What
if we do it the other way around?
MIKE
(getting it)
Use the directories to identify bad
priests?
ROBBY
Yeah, exactly. We search by
designation, we look for any priest
on ‘sick leave’ or ‘unnassigned’ -MIKE
Or for priests who moved around a
lot...
Yeah.

ROBBY

Hey guys, I’m really sorry, I am, I

whom?

To

ERIC MACLEISH
The Globe. Years ago. After the
Porter case, I got plenty of calls.
I had 20 priests in Boston but I
couldn’t go after them without
press. So I sent you guys a list of
names and you buried it.

SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
No, I haven’t been to church for
some time now. But I still consider
myself a Catholic.
MIKE
How does that work?
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
The Church is an institution, Mike,
made of men. It’s passing. My
faith is in the eternal. I try to
separate the two.
MIKE
Sounds tricky.
Mike’s shakes his pen, out of ink. He crosses to his backpack
by the front door. He reaches in, digs around.
SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
It is. Especially since the Church
continues to go after me. It takes
a toll, Mike.
SIPE (CONT’D)
They’ll try to silence anyone who
speaks out. I’m sure they’ll come

any idea to who?
BEN
(irked)
No. Why?
MIKE
Just curious. I wanted to see if
there were any other leads you guys
didn’t run out?
BEN

But the numbers clearly indicate
senior clergy were involved.
MARTY
That’s all they do, indicate.
MIKE
You’re telling me we run a
story about fifty pedophile
priests in Boston --

ROBBY
(stepping in)
Mike--

MARTY (CONT’D)
We’ll get into the same cat fight
you got into on Porter, which made a
lot of noise but changed things not
one bit. We need to focus on the
institution not the individual
priests. Practice and policy. Show
me the Church manipulated the system
so that these guys wouldn’t have to
face charges. Show me they put
those same priests back into
parishes, time and time again. Show
me this was systemic, that it came
from the top down.
Beat.

Pretty fucking clear.

Sounds like we’re going after Law?

JUDGE SWEENEY
Could you please clarify the Globe’s
position for me, Mr. Albano?
The courtroom’s empty, Garabedian at one desk, WILSON D.
ROGERS JR., 60s, the Church’s lawyer, at another.
ALBANO
Yes, Judge Sweeney. Our argument to
make these documents public rests
mainly on 1st amendment grounds. We
also have a number of other relevant
arguments. After all, your honor,
this was a discretionary order...
JUDGE SWEENEY
Yes, Mr. Albano, it was made at the
Judge’s discretion...
Mike FIGHTS TEDIUM... until a REPORTER slides in next to him.
Hey Mike.

priests and victims.
SACHA
He didn’t try to hide it at all, he
had this odd rationalization for it.
Like it was normal to fool around
with little boys.
Nearby, we see Matt adding 3x5 victim cards to the wall. On
the wall, 19 OF ROUGHLY 50 PRIESTS have cards. [N.B.: The
priests (and victims) should be grouped by neighborhood].

We will. Just not yet... Let’s

ALBANO
There’s nothing personal in these
documents, your honor, they concern
how the Cardinal is handling-JUDGE SWEENEY
Say the Archdiocese.
ALBANO
Er, excuse me?
JUDGE SWEENEY
You don’t get to tag the Cardinal
with everything, Mr. Albano. Say
the Archdiocese.
Albano looks flustered.
WILSON D. ROGERS JR.
Judge Sweeney, the Globe isn’t a
party to this case, they just want
to sell papers. If Mr. Garabedian
hadn’t smeared the Cardinal’s good
name, we wouldn’t even be here.
GARABEDIAN
Your honor, I object to the use of
the word smear.
JUDGE SWEENEY
Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian.
Garabedian, angry, mutters under his breath. Mike catches it.

Garabedian sits on the courthouse steps, eating a packed

MIKE
How you doing, Mitch?
Mike walks up, sits down.
I’m fine.

GARABEDIAN

MIKE
(pushing him)
He’s tough, that Wilson Rogers.

109

11/26/14

He’s smug.

GARABEDIAN
And he’s sloppy.

MIKE
He doesn’t seem sloppy.
GARABEDIAN
You don’t know the half of it.
Trust me.
MIKE
What’s the half of it?
(then)
Tell me the half of it, Mitch.
Garabedian looks at him, wrestling with something.
GARABEDIAN
Off the record.
MIKE
Off the record.
GARABEDIAN
Three years ago, I get a call from
an ex-Priest. Anthony Benzevich.
He was at Blessed Sacrament back in
‘62 and he saw Geoghan taking little
boys up to the Rectory bedroom.
Benzevich was appalled, he told the
Bishop. And the Bishop threatened
to reassign him. To South America.
Jeez.

MIKE

GARABEDIAN
Yeah. So, fast-forward 35 years,
Benzevich reads Geoghan’s been
charged with molesting more than a
hundred kids. Benzevich feels
guilty, he calls me.
MIKE
You have testimony from a priest
telling his superiors about Geoghan
in 62’?
GARABEDIAN
No, I do not. Because when I call
Benzevich in to give a deposition,
he shows up with a lawyer.

94.

11/26/14
MIKE
Wilson Rogers.
GARABEDIAN
Suddenly, Father Benzevich has a
foggy memory. Can’t remember
anything. He’s useless. So I go
back to work, I forget about it,
whatever. Until about a year ago. I
find an article about a priest who
warned church officials about
Geoghan.
MIKE
(stunned)
Benzevich went to the press.
GARABEDIAN
Local paper, Patriot Ledger, nobody
saw it. But now I got Benzevich on
record, so I file a motion to depose
him a second time. And Wilson
Rogers, that smug son of a bitch, he
files a motion opposing my motion.
And that’s when I have him!
MIKE
Have him how?
GARABEDIAN
Rogers opposes my motion. So I gotta
make an argument as to why I’m
allowed to depose Father Benzevich a
second time. But now, I’m allowed
to attach exhibits. You follow what
I’m saying?
MIKE
The sealed documents...
GARABEDIAN
Yes, I can use the sealed documents
I’ve gotten in discovery, Mr.
Rezendes, the same documents your
paper is currently suing for.
MIKE
You’re shitting me.
GARABEDIAN
No, I am not shitting you. So I
pull out the 14 most damning docs
and I attach them to my motion. And
they prove everything.
(MORE)

95.

11/26/14

96.

GARABEDIAN (CONT'D)
About the Church, about the bishops,
about Law...
MIKE
And it’s all public? Because your
motion to oppose Rogers’ motion...
GARABEDIAN
...is public. That’s correct.
you’re paying attention.

Now

MIKE
(head spinning)
So I can just walk into the
courthouse right now and get those
documents?
GARABEDIAN
No. You cannot. Because the
documents are not there.
MIKE
But you just said they’re public.
GARABEDIAN
I know I did. But this is Boston.
And the Church doesn’t want them to
be found. So they are not there.
MIKE
Mitch, are you telling me that the
Catholic Church had legal documents
removed from the courthouse?
Mitch collects his things, turns to Mike.

With clarity.

GARABEDIAN
Look, I’m not crazy, I’m not
paranoid, I’m experienced. Check
the docket, you’ll see. They control
everything. Everything.
Mitch exits. Mike watches him go, UNNERVED. Is Mitch right?
And was that just the mother of all tips? A beat... then
Mike grabs his stuff and runs towards his car.

No, we’re here because you’re an

JUDGE VOLTERRA
These exhibits you’re after, Mr.
Rezendes, they’re very sensitive
records.
MIKE
All due respect, your honor, that’s
not the question here. The records
are public.
JUDGE VOLTERRA
Maybe so, but tell me, where is the
editorial responsibility in
publishing records of this nature?
MIKE
Where’s the editorial responsibility
in not publishing them?

INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY COURTHOUSE, RECORDS ROOM - DAY

137

Clerk O’Brian drops the file in front of Mike, who dives in.
His face says it all. HOLY SHIT. A beat, then Mike grabs
the files, starts to rush out.
CLERK O’BRIAN
You can’t take those. You need to
make copies.
MIKE
Yeah, I’m going to the copy room.
CLERK O’BRIAN
It closed at four.
Mike stops, fucked.

He digs into his pocket, counts bills.

MIKE
I’ll give you 83 bucks to use yours.

EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY COURTHOUSE, DOWNTOWN BOSTON - TWILIGHT 138
Mike, already on his cell phone, hurries across the street
toward and catches a cab.
MIKE
Hey, Cabbie! Hey, hey, hey!
Mike gets in cab.
MIKE (CONT’D)
I’m going to the Boston Globe on
Morrisey Boulevard. Don't take 93.

EXT. STATE STREET, BOSTON - MOMENTS LATER

138A

Mike’s cab moves up State Street.
MIKE (V.O.)
Law knew about Geoghan for years, no
question! There’s a letter to Law
from a woman, Margaret Gallant, who
lived in Jamaica Plain in the early
80’s when Geoghan was there. Listen
to this...

The cab is stuck on Old Colony Road. It turns into a TRAFFIC
CIRCLE, past St. Monica’s church and onto Columbia Road.

MIKE (V.O.)
...but since Father Geoghan is still
in his parish...” She sent it to
Law and Law did shit!
142A

EXT. COLUMBIA STREET, DORCHESTER - SAME TIME

142A

The cab drives down by the water.
MIKE (V.O.)
Here’s another one to Law, same
year. Listen to this...
(reading)
“A word on the recent assignment of
Father John Geoghan...”
144

EXT. BOSTON GLOBE - EVENING

The cab pulls up. Mike jumps out, pays the driver, hustles
inside.
MIKE (V.O.)
“...as an associate at Saint Julia’s
in Weston. Father Geoghan...”
145

INT. GLOBE, LOBBY - LATER

145

Mike races in through the glass doors, then hustles up the
escalator...
MIKE (V.O.)
“...has a history of homosexual
involvement with young boys. I
understand his recent departure from
Saint Brendan's may be related to
this problem...”
147

INT. GLOBE, SPOTLIGHT OFFICE - NIGHT
The whole team sits around as Mike finishes reading.
MIKE
“I wonder if Father Geoghan should
not be reduced to weekend work while
receiving therapy. You know how
grateful I am to you for your
constant concern, sincerely yours in
our Lord, Most Reverend John M.
D'Arcy, Auxiliary Bishop of Boston.
December 7, 1984.”
MATT
An auxiliary bishop wrote that?

147

11/26/14
We see the letters, both addressed to Law.

114.
The team reels.

SACHA
It’s incredible. He broke ranks.
When did Gallant write her letter?
MIKE

1984.

SACHA
And Law just ignored her.
MATT
How do you ignore that freakin’
letter?!
MIKE
We’ve got him. You can’t read those
letters and think anything else.
It’s proof.
Yeah.

ROBBY
It is. This is good work.

MIKE
Should we take it up to Ben?
ROBBY
No, not yet.
Why not?

MIKE
We got Law. This is it.

ROBBY
No, this is Law covering for one
priest. There’s another 90 out
there.
MIKE
Yeah, and we can print that story
when we get it but we gotta go with
this now.
ROBBY
I’m not gonna rush the story, Mike.
MIKE
We don’t have a choice, if we don’t
run to press, somebody else is gonna
find those letters and butcher the
story! Joe Quimby from the Herald
was at the freakin’ courthouse!

11/26/14

115.

ROBBY
So we’ll write a holding story and
we’ll keep an eye on the Herald.
MIKE
(losing it)
Keep our eye on the Herald? They
run this and they get it wrong, the
Church will bury it! We gotta do
this now!
Mike --

MATTY

MIKE
What? Why are we hesitating!
Baron told us to get Law!

ROBBY
Baron told us to get the system. We
need the full scope, that’s the only
thing that will put an end to this.
MIKE
Then let’s take it up to Ben, let
him decide!
ROBBY
We’ll take it to Ben when I say it’s
time.
MIKE
It’s time, Robby. They knew and they
let it happen! To kids! This
coulda been you, it coulda been me,
it could have been any one of us.
We gotta nail these scumbags, show
people that no one can get away with
this! Not a priest or a Cardinal or
a fricking Pope!
Robby, Sacha, and Matt are still. Mike looks around the room,
out of breath, adrenaline draining. Robby is pissed.
ROBBY
You finished?
MIKE
Yeah. I am. This is bullshit.
Mike leaves, slamming the door behind him.

She tries to slide the upper rack into the dishwasher. It’s
jammed. She tries again. It won’t go. She jiggles the rack,
tries a third time... she SNAPS, slamming the rack hard,
sending the dirty glasses crashing into each other.
She looks up... Hansi is just staring at her.
You okay?

Whoa.

HANSI

Before she can answer, there’s a KNOCK on the door.

MIKE
Hey, Hansi.

Sacha walks onto the porch with two beers, hands one to Mike.
MIKE
Thanks. I dunno why I got so pissed

but...
SACHA
You care about the story, Mike.
all do.

We

Mike takes a drink.
SACHA (CONT’D)
I stopped going to church with my
Nana. It was just too hard. I’d be
sitting there and I would start
thinking about Joe Crowley or
someone else and I’d just get so
angry.
MIKE
Did you tell her why?
SACHA
She goes to church three times a
week, Mike.
Mike considers this.

Shakes his head.

MIKE
Really pisses me off.

11/26/14

117.

MIKE (CONT'D)
You know, I actually liked going to
mass when I was a kid.
SACHA
Why’d you stop?
MIKE
Typical shit.
(then)
But the weird thing is, I think
there was a part of me that figured
one day, maybe I’d go back. I was
holding on to that.
Sacha watches him, not expecting this.
MIKE (CONT’D)
And when I read those letters,
something just cracked.
SACHA
That’s a shitty feeling.
Yeah.

MIKE
It’s a shitty feeling.

Off the two of them, a little lost...

Robby is at

PETER CONLEY
Looks like a long day.
Hey Pete.

ROBBY

PETER CONLEY
I’m sorry to make it longer.

Brian?

Peter Conley sits, nods to the barman: ‘the usual.’
ROBBY
Anyone ever said no to a drink with
you, Pete?
PETER CONLEY
Sure. The trick is to keep asking.
(raising his glass)
For Boston.

151

11/26/14
ROBBY
For Boston.
(drinks, then)
So, you here for the Cardinal?
PETER CONLEY
No, no, I wouldn’t presume to speak
for the Cardinal.
(then)
You gotta a lot of people here who
respect you, Robby, respect your
work.
ROBBY
Good to know.
PETER CONLEY
It’s ‘cause you care about this
place. It’s why you do what you do,
it’s who you are. But people need
the Church more than ever right now.
You can feel it. And the Cardinal
may not be perfect but we can’t
throw out all the good he’s doing
over a few bad apples.
Robby lets this sink in.

Nods as if in agreement.

PETER CONLEY (CONT’D)
I’m bringing this up with you
because I know this is Baron’s idea.
His agenda. And I gotta tell you,
honest to God, I don’t think he
cares about this city the way we do.
How could he?
Robby looks at Conley.

A long beat.

ROBBY
This is how it happens, isn’t it,
Pete?
PETER CONLEY
What’s that?
ROBBY
A guy leans on a guy and suddenly
the whole town just looks the other
way.
Stung.

Pete downs his drink.

Gets up.

118.

11/26/14

119.

PETER CONLEY
Robby, look. Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark. He’ll be
here for a couple years and he’s
gonna move on. Just like he did in
New York and Miami. Where you gonna
go?
He starts to go.
ROBBY
Pete?
(Pete turns)
When we do run the story, I’m gonna
need a comment from the Cardinal.
Conley takes it.

Then smiles.

PETER CONLEY
We’ll talk again later.
Robby.
153

Good night,

INT. GLOBE, ROBBY’S OFFICE/SPOTLIGHT OFFICE - DAY

153

Robby, Mike, Sacha and Matt sit working. It’s dark, quiet,
serious. A beat, then Robby’s phone RINGS. He answers.
ROBBY (INTO PHONE)
Robby. What? No shit, when?
(hangs up, calls out)
Hey.

Okay.

The team looks towards Robby’s office as he walks in.
What’s up?

MIKE

ROBBY
Sweeney ruled in our favor. She
ruled to unseal the documents.
Jeez...

MIKE

The group sits stunned.
154

INT. GLOBE, MARTY’S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
Marty, Ben, Robby, and Canellos (the Metro editor we met
earlier) sit with the Globe lawyer, Albano.

154

11/26/14

120.

ALBANO
The Church already filed an appeal.
But the trial court’s ruling is
generally upheld in these matters.
MARTY
And when would we get the documents?
ALBANO
Probably takes Cohen a few weeks to
rule, then there’ll be a redaction
process... I’d say they’ll be made
public mid-January.
Okay.

MARTY
Thanks, John.

And nice work.

Albano exits.
CANELLOS
Metro should run something, Marty.
ROBBY
We can’t run this big.
CANELLOS
Why wouldn’t we? It’s a major First
Amendment victory. Not to mention,
an Irish Catholic judge rules
against the church? That’s a hell
of a precedent.
ROBBY
(to Ben)
We don’t want the Herald going too
deep on this.
MARTY
Why’s that?
ROBBY
You’re gonna have to step out,
Peter.
CANELLOS
I’m not stepping out.
Robby picks up a FOLDER OF DOCUMENTS on the table beside him.
He places it in front of Marty. Marty picks it up.
Peter.
Marching orders.

BEN
Canellos exits, not happy.

MARTY
When did you -ROBBY
A couple of weeks ago.
BEN
A couple of weeks?
Yeah.

121.

ROBBY

BEN
And you’re telling us now?
MARTY
These are substantial. They clearly
show that Law was negligent.
Ben and Marty stare at Robby.

A beat, then --

ROBBY
I need more time. I want to keep
digging.
BEN
For what? This is the goddamn story.
ROBBY
It’s not the whole story.
BEN
(dismissive)
Tough shit. We’re on a clock now.
Even if we don’t run Sweeney’s
ruling, another paper could find
these letters and fuck the story.
ROBBY
Agreed. But we run the letters
alone, Law apologizes, says it’s a
one time thing, he can bury it.
MARTY
How? These clearly show he knew and
did nothing.
ROBBY
Look, I’m close to stories on 70
priests.
(MORE)

11/26/14
ROBBY (CONT'D)
We nail that along with those
letters, it’s proof that this is
bigger than Law. It’s the whole
system.
Marty considers.
MARTY
You have multiple sources confirming
the 70 priests?
On some.

ROBBY
I can get more.

BEN
Too risky. If we’re not buttoned up
on every single one of them, the
Church’ll pick us apart.
Robby’s up against it. He plays his hand.
ROBBY
I think I can get someone from the
other side of the aisle.
BEN
Someone inside the Church?
ROBBY
Yeah, a lawyer.
MARTY
Will he go on the record?
ROBBY
Deep background.

Marty considers.

But he’s a solid

A beat, then Ben steps in.

BEN
Rezendes needs time to write up the
story. We don’t want to drop this
at Christmas, not after 9/11. We
could run it just after New Year’s,
before the rest of the documents are
released.
MARTY
Okay. Tell Canellos to bury the
ruling in Metro.
(then, to Robby)
You’ve got six weeks.

122.

11/26/14
Robby nods, gets up and leaves.

Ben follows him into --

INT. GLOBE, NEWSROOM OUTSIDE MARTY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ben and Robby walk out.
BEN
Tell Mike I want a draft before
Christmas. And we need a response
from Lake Street. Who does PR for
the Cardinal? Still John Walsh?
ROBBY
No, somebody new, Donna Morrisey,
she came from TV, she’s young.
BEN
Good, get a quote, we need something
from Law to appear even-handed.
Got it.

ROBBY

BEN
And Robby? Next time give me a
goddamn heads up?
Ben exits. Robby takes it on the chin then walks off. As he

JIM’S WIFE
What a nice surprise.

REVEAL Robby at the door.
162

He walks into --

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE, JIM’S HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Jim sits at on a leather couch watching golf. Through a

Jim looks up, less than happy to see Robby standing there.
JIM
Hon, give us a minute, will you?
Jim’s wife looks surprised.
Sure.

JIM’S WIFE

ROBBY
Good to see you, Karen.
She leaves.

Jim turns off the TV,

What’s up?

JIM

Robby pulls out a list, hands it to Jim.

11/26/14

125.

ROBBY
I’m out of time, Jim. We’ve got
cover-up stories on 70 priests, but
the boss isn’t gonna run it unless I
get confirmation from your side.
Jim turns off the TV, looks it over.
JIM
Are you out of your mind?
ROBBY
Come on. This is our town, Jimmy.
We all knew something was going on
and no one did a thing. We gotta
put an end to it.
JIM
Don’t tell me what I gotta do!
Yeah, I helped defend these
scumbags, but that’s my job, Robby.
I was doing my job!
Yeah.

ROBBY
You and everyone else.

Jim stands, hands Robby the list.
JIM
Get out of my house.
163

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE, BROOKLINE - MOMENTS LATER
Robby walks out of the house, toward his car.
Hey!

JIM

Robby turns, finds Sullivan.
JIM (CONT’D)
You come to my home and lay this
shit on me!
(then)
You’re right, Robby, we all knew
something was going to on. So where
were you? What took you so long?!
This lands with Robby.

No answer.

ROBBY
I don’t know, Jimmy.
Jim shakes his head, looks like he might slug Robby.

JIM
Give me the list.
Jim holds out his hand. Robby hands him the list. Jim eyes
the first page, flips to the second. He checks the names...
then flips back. He looks at Robby. Holds out a hand for a
pen. Robby gives him one.
Jim leans on the roof of Robby’s car. Marks up the list,
then hands it back to Robby. Nothing more to say, Jim turns
and walks away. Robby looks down at the list. Reacts.
THE ENTIRE first page is CIRCLED.

That’s what I thought. Okay,
Larry.
They hang up.

MATT (INTO PHONE)
When did you talk to her?
Yeah. That’s good to know.
Thanks, Pete.

Mike walks to the coffee machine.

Anything?

MIKE

MATT
Conley said Donna Morrisey should
have called, he just left Lake

Rasky said the same thing.

MATT
This is ridiculous. You’d think
they want to get out ahead of this.

MIKE
Seems appropriate.
The phone rings.

Mike grabs it.

calling. I just had a few questions

Yeah.

That oughta do it.
MARTY

“The Church had no interest in
knowing what the Globe’s questions
would be.”
(hands it to Mike)
Work it in somewhere before the
jump.
(to the team)
Anything else?
ROBBY
Matt wants to put the letters online
so readers can see it for
themselves.
MATT
We can run the URL at the bottom of
the article. It’s pretty
straightforward.
No one really knows what that means.
Okay.

MARTY

MATT
We also put the Spotlight tip line
at the end of the story so people
can call in. Goes directly to our
office.
SACHA

BEN (CONT'D)
After we ran the Porter story, the
message center was tied up for
weeks. It was a real problem.
MATT
And we had picketers.

Lots of them.

MARTY
I’ll talk to Gilman about security
and the phones.
(to Robby)
How’s it coming on the folo story?
Robby looks to Sacha.
SACHA
We’ve nailed down multiple stories
on seventy priests.
MARTY
All seventy?
SACHA
Yeah. And with the confirmation
from Robby’s source, we’re ready to
go. We can have a draft next week.
MARTY
Robby, that source of yours, is this
someone we could revisit?
ROBBY
Might be tough.
BEN
But he has no problem helping the
church protect dozens of dirty
priests. Guy’s a scumbag.
Matt glances at Robby.

Who’s looking at Ben.

MATT
He’s a lawyer, he’s doing his job.
MIKE
He a shill for the Church.
BEN
He knew and did nothing.
MIKE
He coulda said something about this
years ago. Maybe saved some lives.

ROBBY
What about us?
BEN
What’s that supposed to mean?
ROBBY
We had all the pieces.
we get it sooner?

Why didn’t

BEN
We didn’t have all the pieces.
ROBBY
We had Saviano, we had Barrett, we
had Geoghan. We had the directories
in the basement.
BEN
You know what?

We got it now.

MIKE
Robby, this story needed Spotlight.
ROBBY
Spotlight’s been around since 1970.
BEN
So what? We didn’t know the scope
of this. No one did. This started
with one goddamn priest, Robby.
Robby looks at Sacha.

A beat.

ROBBY
MacLeish sent us a letter on 20
priests, years ago. Sacha found the
clip.
MIKE
Are you freaking kidding me?

When?

SACHA
Just after Porter.

BEN
That was you. You were Metro.
ROBBY
Yeah, that was me. I’d just taken
over. I don’t remember it at all.
But yeah.
The room quiets.

Gut punch. Ben shakes his head.

MARTY
Uh, can I say something?
They turn to him.
MARTY (CONT’D)
Sometimes it’s easy to forget that
we spend most of our time stumbling
around in the dark. Suddenly a
light gets turned on, and there’s
fair share of blame to go around.
(then)
I can’t speak to what happened
before I arrived but all of you have
done some very good reporting here,
reporting that I believe is going to
have an immediate and considerable
impact on our readers.
(then)
For me, this kind of story is why we
do this.
The team takes this in.
MARTY (CONT’D)
Having said that, Cardinal Law and
the Catholic community are going to
have a very strong response to this.
So if you need to take a moment,
you’ve earned it. But I will need
you back here Monday morning focused
and ready to do your job.

I just got a call from the Cardinal.
Really.

BEN
Why?

MARTY
He wanted to tell me personally that
he had decided not to comment. He
said he wanted to, uh, extend me
that courtesy.
BEN
Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What’d you say?

I told him he was making a mistake.
And that we were going to run the

Sacha, can I have a drink of water?
SACHA
Sure, Nana.
