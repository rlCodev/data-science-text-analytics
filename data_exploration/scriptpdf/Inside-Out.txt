BLACK.
JOY (V.O.)
Do you ever look at someone and
wonder, “What is going on inside
their head?” Well, I know. I know
Riley’s head.
WHITE.

FADE IN...

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
A newborn baby swaddled in a blanket, held by her parents.
Push in... and ZOOM IN TO HER HEAD.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Out of the blackness steps a glowing figure. This is JOY. The
room is black except for a bright CONSCIOUSNESS SCREEN.
Hmm?

JOY

In front of Joy is a single large BUTTON. She pushes it.
INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
The baby gurgles and wiggles happily.
JOY (V.O.)
And there she was...
INT. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS SCREEN:
MOM
Hello, Riley.
DAD
Oh look at you. Aren’t you a little
bundle of joy?
A GOLDEN GLOWING SPHERE rolls from behind the screen. It’s a
MEMORY of what we just saw: Mom and Dad cooing at Riley.
Whoa.

JOY

2.

INSIDE OUT
Joy rolls the memory on its track, illuminating the room. She
turns back to the button and pushes it again.
INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
Baby Riley gurgles happily.
JOY (V.O.)
It was amazing. Just Riley and me,
forever...
INT. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
Baby Riley CRIES.
JOY (V.O.)
...for 33 seconds.
Joy looks to her side. There’s a new, droopy, blue character
touching the button.
SADNESS
I’m Sadness.
JOY
Oh, hello. I’m Joy.
Joy tries to muscle past Sadness to press the button.
JOY (CONT’D)
Can I just... if you could... I
just want to fix that. Thanks.
The two struggle.
JOY (V.O.)
And that was just the beginning.
Headquarters only got more crowded
from there.
INT. MINNESOTA HOUSE - DAY
Riley, now age 3, barrels through the house pulling a wagon.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ON THE SCREEN: Riley’s POV as she runs through the house.
Fear “supervises” Joy, who drives.

3.

INSIDE OUT
FEAR
Very nice. Okay, looks like you got
this. Very good, sharp turn...
Riley approaches a POWER CORD on the ground.
FEAR (CONT’D)
Ahh! Look out!!! No!
Fear leaps to the console.
JOY (V.O.)
That’s Fear. He’s really good at
keeping Riley safe.
INT. MINNESOTA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Riley stops. She cautiously steps over the power cord.
FEAR (O.S.)
Easy... we’re good! We’re good.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
A fear memory (purple) rolls in.
JOY/SADNESS
Whew!/Nice job.
FEAR
Thank you! Thank you very much.
Joy jumps back into driving position.
JOY
And we’re back!
INT. MINNESOTA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Riley continues her sprint through the house.
Suddenly she’s picked up.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
PLOP into highchair. Bib. Tray. Bowl.
DAD
Here we go. Alright, open.

4.

INSIDE OUT
Dad lifts a spoonful of food to Riley’s mouth.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Hmm. This looks new.
FEAR/SADNESS
Do you think it’s safe?/What is it?
ON THE SCREEN: a spoonful of broccoli.
DISGUST enters.
DISGUST
Okay, caution! There is a dangerous
smell, people. Hold on, what is
that?
JOY (V.O.)
This is Disgust. She basically
keeps Riley from being poisoned,
physically and socially.
DISGUST
That is not brightly colored or
shaped like a dinosaur... Hold on
guys... It’s broccoli!
Disgust GAGS and pulls a lever.
INT. KITCHEN
Yucky!

YOUNG RILEY

Riley swats the broccoli.

It flies into Dad’s face.

INT. HEADQUARTERS
A disgust memory (green) rolls in.
DISGUST
Well, I just saved our lives. Yeah.
You're welcome.

5.

INSIDE OUT
INT. KITCHEN
DAD
Riley, if you don’t eat your dinner,
you’re not going to get any dessert.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ANGER looks up from reading his newspaper.
ANGER
Wait. Did he just say we couldn’t
have dessert?
JOY (V.O.)
That’s Anger. He cares very deeply
about things being fair.
ANGER
So that’s how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert? Oh, sure,
we’ll eat our dinner, right after
YOU eat this! GrrrraaaAAHH!!!!
Anger takes the controls as FLAMES blast out of his head. An
anger memory (red) rolls in.
INT. KITCHEN
Riley throws a fit. Dad distracts her.
DAD
(’flying’ the spoon)
Hey, Riley, Riley, here comes an
airplane!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Anger stops screaming.
ANGER
Oh, airplane. We got an airplane,
everybody.
Ohh!/Ahh!

DISGUST/FEAR/SADNESS/JOY

INT. KITCHEN
Dad “lands” the food into Riley’s smiling mouth.

6.

INSIDE OUT
INT. HEADQUARTERS
A happy memory (golden) rolls in.
The others leave Joy alone at the console with Sadness.
JOY (V.O.)
And you’ve met Sadness. She...
well, she...
FLASH CUTS of Riley crying: broken toy, spilled ice cream,
tantrum in the supermarket, wanting out of her car seat.
JOY (V.O.)
I’m not actually sure what she
does. And I’ve checked, there’s no
place for her to go, so she’s good,
we’re good. It’s all great!
Sadness exits. Joy turns to the wall of golden memories.
JOY (V.O.)
Anyway! These are Riley’s memories-and they’re mostly happy, you’ll
notice, not to brag.
She inspects one of the golden memories: Riley and her friend
MEG (both age 3) going down a slide. She REWINDS it,
relishing the happy moment.
JOY (V.O.)
But the REALLY important ones are
over here. I don’t want to get too
technical, but these are called
CORE MEMORIES.
Joy pops up the CORE MEMORY HOLDER. Inside are five intensely
bright golden memories.
JOY (V.O.)
Each one came from a superimportant time in Riley’s life.
Like when she first scored a goal?
That was so amazing!
EXT. MINNESOTA LAKE, WINTER - DAY
Two-and-a-half-year-old Riley shoots a hockey puck across the
ice. She trips and accidentally scores a goal.

7.

INSIDE OUT
MOM/DAD
(cheering)
Heeey! Would you look at that?! We
got a future center here!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
A super-bright CORE MEMORY rolls in.
It rolls to the Core Memory Holder. Clicking into position,
a LIGHTLINE shoots out. The Emotions follow it to the back
window and watch a new ISLAND OF PERSONALITY form.
JOY (V.O.)
And each core memory powers a
different aspect of Riley’s
personality. Like Hockey Island!
Five ISLANDS OF PERSONALITY float in space, miles from
Headquarters, connected by LIGHTLINES -- their power sources.
JOY (V.O.)
Goofball Island is my personal
favorite.
INT. MINNESOTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Toddler Riley runs naked from the bathroom, underpants on her
head, laughing wildly. Dad chases her with a towel.
DAD
Come back here, you little monkey!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Goofball Island activates: lights, movement, etc.
INT. MINNESOTA LIVING ROOM
Naked Riley does the goofy dance on the sofa.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY (V.O.)
Yup, Goofball is the best! Friendship
Island is pretty good too.
Joy looks at FRIENDSHIP ISLAND.

She reveals a

INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy examines Family Island.
JOY (V.O.)
And, of course, Family Island is
amazing.
EXT. MINNESOTA KITCHEN TABLE - DAY
The family decorate cookies together. Riley stuffs one into
Dad's mouth.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
The Emotions look out over the Islands of Personality.
JOY (V.O.)
The point is, the Islands of
Personality are what make Riley...
Riley!
INT. BATHROOM
Riley splashes in the bathtub.
YOUNG RILEY
Look out, mermaid!

INT. MINNESOTA LIVING ROOM
Riley climbs the couch. She looks at the floor.

YOUNG RILEY

Riley jumps from couch to chair to avoid the lava.
INT. MINNESOTA HOUSE
Riley draws. Pull back to reveal she’s drawing on the wall.
YOUNG RILEY
(singing)
Who’s your friend who likes to
play? Bing Bong, Bing Bong...
EXT. MINNESOTA LAKE - DAY
Six-year-old Riley skates across the ice backwards.
MOM/DAD
Hey! Very nice! Where did you learn
that?
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy skates around the room, in sync with Riley.
EXT. MINNESOTA FRONT STEPS - DAY
Riley and Meg slurp frozen drinks. Riley grimaces: ice
headache!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR
Brain freeze!
The Emotions scream as Headquarters freezes over.

INT. HEADQUARTERS
Yaaay!

JOY

INT. RILEY’S MINNESOTA BEDROOM - NIGHT
Parents tuck Riley into bed and turn off the light.
DAD
Good night, kiddo!
RILEY
G’night, Dad.
She looks up at the stars on her ceiling and falls asleep.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy watches the screen go DARK. She inspects the shelves
mostly populated with GOLDEN MEMORIES.
JOY
And... we’re out. That’s what I’m
talking about: another perfect day!
Nice job everybody! Let’s get those
memories down to Long Term.
Joy pulls a lever. Memories cascade down the shelves.
FEAR
All right, we did not die today! I
call that an unqualified success.
The memories pachinko down the shelves and up a tube. Joy
runs to the back window to watch them glide through the
distant tubes towards Long-Term Memory like falling stars.
JOY (V.O.)
And that’s it! We love our girl.
She’s got great friends and a great
house. Things couldn’t be better.
After all, Riley’s 11 now. What
could happen?

TITLE CARD: INSIDE OUT
The car drives across the bridge. Riley looks out the window.
JOY (V.O.)
Hey look! The Golden Gate Bridge!
Isn’t that great?! It’s not made
out of solid gold like we thought,
which is kind of a disappointment,
but still!
The car drives past the Ferry Building.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.
Otherwise I’d be terrified right
now!
Everyone eyes each other behind Fear’s back.
JOY
Uh... yeah.
EXT. LOMBARD STREET - DAY
The car is stuck in traffic. Cars HONK and people YELL.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ANGER
These are my kind of people!
EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
DAD
All right, just a few more blocks.
We’re almost to our new house!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ANGER
Step on it, Daddy!

13.

INSIDE OUT
DISGUST
Why don't we just live in this
smelly car? We've already been in
it forever.
JOY
Which, actually, was really lucky,
because that gave us plenty of time
to think about what our new house
is going to look like! Let’s review
the top five daydreams.
Joy plugs in DAYDREAMS showing fantasy houses: tree house,
water-slide house, etc.
FEAR
Ooh! That looks safe!
JOY
Ohh, this is will be great for
Riley! Oh, no, no, no, THIS one.
A gingerbread house.
DISGUST (O.S.)
Ugh, Joy. For the last time, she
cannot live in a cookie.
A castle.
ANGER
THAT’S the one! It comes with a
dragon!
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - DAY
JOY (O.S.)
Now we’re getting close, I can feel
it. Here it is, here’s our new
house... and...
The car stops and Riley steps out.
REVEAL: a run-down Victorian. Nothing like the daydreams.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Everyone looks slackjawed.
JOY
Maybe it’s nice on the inside.

14.

INSIDE OUT
INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Riley steps inside. The room is dark, dusty, uninviting.
ANGER (V.O.)
We’re supposed to live here?
SADNESS (V.O.)
Do we have to?
DISGUST (V.O.)
I’m telling you, it smells like
something died in here.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
A disgust memory rolls in.
FEAR
Can you die from moving?
JOY
Guys, you’re overreacting. Nobody
is dying-DISGUST
A DEAD MOUSE!!!
ON THE SCREEN: A dead mouse in the corner.
DISGUST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I’m gonna be sick...
ANGER (O.S.)
Great, this is just great.
FEAR (O.S.)
Ahhhhh!! It’s the house of the
dead! What are we gonna do?! We’re
gonna get rabies!!!
Fear jumps into Anger’s arms. Anger fires up the flames.
ANGER
GET OFFA ME!!!
Fear runs around on fire. Joy puts him out with a fire
extinguisher.
JOY
Hey, hey, hey, all through the
drive Dad talked about how cool our
new room is. Let’s go check it out!

15.

INSIDE OUT
FEAR/ANGER/DISGUST (O.S.)
You’re right, Joy/Yeah!/That’s
right!/Yes, yes, yes!
INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE
Riley dashes up the stairs.
INT. RILEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
It’s tiny. Depressing.
FEAR/DISGUST/ANGER (O.S.)
No, no, no, no, no./I’m starting to
envy the dead mouse./Get out the
rubber ball, we’re in solitary
confinement.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
SADNESS
Oh, Riley can’t live here.
She's right.

ANGER

DISGUST
It’s the worst. It’s
absolutely the worst.

Really bad.

FEAR

ANGER
This house stinks.

Memories roll in: anger, disgust, fear.
JOY
Hey, it’s nothing our butterfly
curtains couldn’t fix. I read
somewhere that an empty room is an
opportunity.
ANGER
Where did you read that?
JOY
It doesn’t matter. I read it and
it’s great. We’ll put the bed
there. And the desk over there...
Joy projects an IMAGINATION of Riley’s furniture.
FEAR
The hockey lamp goes there...

16.

INSIDE OUT
ANGER
Put the chair there.

Posters...

SADNESS

DISGUST
Well, the trophy collection
goes there.
FEAR
Stars! I like that.

JOY
Now we’re talking! Let’s go get our
stuff from the moving van!
INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - DAY
Riley dashes down the stairs as Mom and Dad enter the house.
Dad is on the phone.
DAD
Alright. Goodbye.
(hangs up; to Mom)
Well, guess what? The moving van
won’t be here until Thursday.
MOM
You’re kidding.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR
The van is lost?! This is the worst
day ever!
ON THE SCREEN: Mom and Dad ARGUE.
MOM
You said it would be here
yesterday!

DAD
I know that’s what I said.
That’s what they told me!

FEAR (O.S.)
Mom and Dad are stressed out!
FEAR/ANGER/DISGUST/SADNESS
They’re arguing!/What are we going
to do?/This is so stressful./What
is their problem?
Joy runs to storage and grabs what looks to be a LIGHTBULB.
JOY
I’ve got a great idea!
She clicks the IDEA into the console.

INSIDE OUT
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM - DAY
Riley’s face lights up. Riley grabs her hockey stick. Puts a
wad of paper in play.
MOM
Did you even read the
contract?

DAD
Honey, you act like this is
my fault--

RILEY
Andersen makes her move. She's
closing in!
DAD
(grabbing a broom)
Hey! Oh, no you’re not!
RILEY
She’s lining up for the shot!
DAD
Coming behind you! Watch out!
She slides past him. Knocks the “puck” into the fireplace.
RILEY
She shoots and she scores! Yeah!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
The Emotions cheer. Out the back window, Family Island runs.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
RILEY
(taunting Mom)
Come on, Grandma!
MOM
Ha! “Grandma?”
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Uh-oh, she put her hair up, we’re

INSIDE OUT
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM
They all play hockey, Mom using a pillow to guard the “goal.”
Dad picks her up to shoot past her.
MOM
(laughing)
Woo! Hey, put me down!
Dad scoops up Riley, too. Riley giggles.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
A happy memory rolls in. Joy’s back in charge.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM
Dad’s cell phone beeps.
DAD
Ugh. Sorry, hold on, hold on.
(answers)
Hello?
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Wait. Wha--?
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM
DAD
You’re kidding. All right. Stall
for me, I’ll be right there.
(hangs up)
The investor’s supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today! I gotta go.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy is disappointed.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM
MOM
It's okay. We get it.

DAD
You’re the best. Thanks, Hon.

See you, Sweetie.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR
Dad just left us.
SADNESS
Oh, he doesn’t love us anymore.
That’s sad. I should drive, right?
JOY BLOCKS HER.
SADNESS (CONT’D)
Joy? What are you doing?
JOY
Uh, just uh, gimme one second...
You know what I’ve realized? Riley
hasn’t had lunch!
(takes a memory off the
wall and plays it)
Remember?
MEMORY: A PIZZA SHOP.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO LIVING ROOM
RILEY
Hey I saw a pizza place down the
street. Maybe we could try that?
MOM
Pizza sounds delicious!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR/ANGER/DISGUST
Yeah!/Pizza!/Good idea, Joy.
Joy smiles.
INT. PIZZA PLACE - DAY
Riley and Mom get their pizza. On it: broccoli.

20.

INSIDE OUT
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR/JOY/DISGUST
What the HECK IS THAT?!/Who puts
broccoli on pizza?/That’s it. I’m
done.
ANGER
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you’ve ruined pizza! First the
Hawaiians, and now YOU!
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATER
Mom and Riley walk home. Riley looks disappointed.
MOM
What kind of a pizza place only
serves one kind of pizza? Must be a
San Francisco thing, huh?
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy glances at the wall of multi-colored memories. She sighs:
things are not going well.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - CONTINUOUS
MOM
Still, it’s not as bad as the soup
at that diner in Nebraska.
RILEY
Oh yeah. The spoon stood up in the
soup by itself! That was
disgusting.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy looks out the back window. Family Island is going.
JOY
Oh good. Family is running.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
MOM
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

21.

INSIDE OUT
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ANGER
Spitting out the car window!
DISGUST
Definitely not when Dad was
singing.
FEAR
Wearing a seat belt!
JOY
What about the time with the
dinosaur!
Joy pulls up a memory.
SADNESS/FEAR/ANGER/DISGUST
Yeah./Yup./That’s the one.
ON THE SCREEN: Riley and Mom pose in front of a roadside
cement dinosaur in Vernal, Utah.
DAD (ON SCREEN)
Say cheese!
Behind Dad, the car rolls down the hill. No brakes!
RILEY (ON SCREEN)
Dad! Dad! Look behind you.
MOM (ON SCREEN)
Honey. The car! The car!
DAD (ON SCREEN)
Hold still. Huh?
(runs off after the car)
Stoooop! No no no nononono!!
Stegosaurus tail through the back window. The family laughs.
Enjoying the memory, Joy and the others chuckle.
FEAR
Nice one, Joy.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
RILEY
(smiling)
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

22.

INSIDE OUT
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy’s cheer is cut short when the dinosaur memory TURNS BLUE.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY
Riley’s smile fades.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Wait. What? What happened?
Joy looks back. Sadness is touching the memory.
FEAR
She did something to the memory.
Joy tries to fix the memory.
JOY
What did you do?
SADNESS
I just touched it.
JOY
That shouldn’t make it change.
FEAR
Change it back, Joy!
Joy rubs it, but the memory stays blue.
JOY
I’m trying.
ANGER
You can’t change it back?
JOY
No, I guess I can’t!
DISGUST
Good going Sadness. Now when Riley
thinks of that moment with Dad,
she’s gonna feel sad. Bravo.
SADNESS
I’m sorry Joy... I don’t really
know-- I thought maybe, if you-- if
I-- if... I mean...

23.

INSIDE OUT
DISGUST
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY
Riley runs towards a stairway and handrail.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Just don’t touch any other memories
until we figure out what’s going on.
Okay.

SADNESS

JOY
(stepping up to controls)
Alright. Get ready, this is a
monster railing, and we are riding
it all the way down!
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - CONTINUOUS
Riley sits on the railing, ready to slide.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Joy looks back: GOOFBALL ISLAND is whirring like crazy.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
Riley goes to slide... but hops off and walks down instead.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Wait, what? What happened?
Suddenly a CORE MEMORY ROLLS up to Joy’s feet.
FEAR
A core memory!
Oh no!

JOY

24.

INSIDE OUT
Out the back window, GOOFBALL ISLAND GOES DARK. Joy rushes to
the Core Memory Holder.
JOY (CONT’D)
Sadness! What are you doing?
SADNESS
It looked like one was crooked so I
opened it and then it fell out!
Joy pops the memory back in. GOOFBALL ISLAND comes back on.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
Riley jumps back on the railing and slides down.
Woo hoo!

RILEY

INT. HEADQUARTERS
SADNESS
It’s just that... I wanted to maybe
hold one.
She reaches out to touch one, AND IT STARTS TO GO BLUE.
JOY!

FEAR

Joy pushes Sadness away before she can touch it.
JOY
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The core memory TURNS BACK TO YELLOW.
JOY (CONT’D)
Sadness! You nearly touched a core
memory. And when you touch them, we
can’t change them back!
SADNESS
I know. I’m sorry. Something’s
wrong with me. It’s like I’m having
a breakdown.
JOY
You are not having a breakdown.
It’s stress.

25.

INSIDE OUT
SADNESS
I keep making mistakes like that.
I’m awful...
JOY
Nooo, you’re not.
SADNESS
...and annoying.
JOY
Well... uh... You know what? You
can’t focus on what’s going wrong.
There’s always a way to turn things
around, to find the fun!
SADNESS
Yeah. Find the fun. I don’t know
how to do that.
JOY
Okay. Well, try think of something
funny!
Long pause.
SADNESS
Oh! Remember the funny movie where
the dog dies?
JOY
Yeah, that’s not...
(tries another approach)
What about that time with Meg, when
Riley laughed so hard milk came out
of her nose? I mean come on...
INSERT: Riley spitting milk out of her nose, Meg laughing.
SADNESS
Yeah, that hurt. It felt like fire.
JOY
Okay, okay, don’t think of that.
Let’s try something else. What are
your favorite things to do?
SADNESS
My favorite? Um, well, I like it
when we’re outside.
JOY
That’s good! Like there’s the beach
and sunshine... Oh!
(MORE)

26.

INSIDE OUT
JOY (CONT'D)
Like that time we buried Dad in the
sand up to his neck?
INSERT: Riley at beach, Dad buried in sand.
SADNESS (V.O.)
I was thinking more like rain.
INSERT: Riley stands in a downpour.
JOY
Rain? Rain... is my favorite too!
We can stomp around in puddles...
INSERT: Riley happily jumps through puddles.
JOY (CONT’D)
There’s cool umbrellas, lightning
storms...
SADNESS (V.O.)
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.
And we get all cold and shivery...
INSERT: Riley’s shoes fill with water. She looks miserable.
SADNESS
...and everything just starts
feeling droopy...
Sadness melts to the floor, crying.
JOY
Oh, hey, hey... easy. Why are you
crying? That’s really the opposite
of what we’re going for here.
SADNESS
Crying helps me slow down and
obsess over the weight of life's
problems.
JOY
Ugh, you know what? Let’s think
about something else. How about we
read some mind manuals, huh? Sounds
fun!
She drags Sadness over to a shelf of technical manuals.
SADNESS
I’ve read most of them.

27.

INSIDE OUT
JOY
Well have you read this one? This
seems interesting: “Long-Term
Memory Retrieval, Volume 47?”
No.

SADNESS

JOY
Ohhh! A real page turner!
SADNESS
(opens manual; reads)
“Long-Term Memory Data Selection
via channel sub-grouping?”
JOY
See? Fun already! You lucky dog,
you’re reading these cool things and
I gotta go work. Life is so unfair.
Joy walks away. But just as she thinks things are handled...
DING! Another memory -- Disgust -- slides in. Joy groans.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - NIGHT
Riley hops down the stairs towards the living room.
DAD (O.S.)
(on phone)
What can we do? We’ve only got
capital to last a month, maybe two.
If we can't find investors by then,
we’re going to have to lay people
off.
Riley hears the stress in Dad’s voice.
RILEY
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me g’night!
MOM
Be right there!
DAD
(on phone)
I know, I know! We’ve got to land
this, okay?
Riley heads back upstairs.

Ew, I don’t want to hear about your

I’ll tell you what it is. This move

I can’t believe Mom and Dad moved

Fine. Let’s see... this house

Pizza is weird here...
SADNESS
Our friends are back home...

Oh c’mon, it could be worse...

Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on the

Riley is lying on the dirty floor in a sleeping bag.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
JOY
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough
start. But think of all the good

No, Joy. There’s absolutely no
reason for Riley to be happy right

FEAR
I say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom.

30.

INSIDE OUT
DISGUST
We have no clean clothes. I mean,
no one should see us.
SADNESS
Yeah, we could cry until we can’t
breathe.
ANGER
We should lock the door and scream

Well, this is it. The new place.

Joy plays the accordion around Headquarters. The others

JOY
Hello! Did I wake you?
ANGER
DO you have to play that?
JOY
Well, I have to practice. And I
don’t think of it as playing so
much as hugging.
She tosses aside the accordion and runs off.
JOY (CONT’D)
Okay, first day of school! Very,
very exciting! I was up late last
night figuring out a new plan. Here
it is.
(to Fear)
Fear! I need a list of all the
possible negative outcomes on the
first day at a new school.

love the way it twirls...
TOOT TOOT! A TRAIN rushes by outside.
JOY (CONT’D)
Train of Thought! Right on
schedule.
The engineer waves from the cab and drops off a large bag.
JOY (CONT’D)
Anger! Unload the daydreams. I
ordered extra in case things get
slow in class.
ANGER
Might come in handy, if this new
school is full of boring useless
classes, which it probably will
be...
Sadness walks by. Joy stops her.
JOY
Oh - Sadness! I have a super
important job just for you.
Really?

SADNESS

JOY
Hey, it’s not MY place to tell you
how to do your job. Just make sure-(nudging Sadness’ foot back
over the line)

Oh!

Wait, what?
FEAR

PING! A memory is created. BRIGHT BLUE.
Huh?
Whoa!

FEAR
It’s a core memory!

But it’s blue!
The bright blue core memory rolls through the memory shelf

JOY
No wait... stop it! No! Ahh!
Joy leaps to the holder and pops it open, preventing the new
blue core memory from going in. Joy grabs it.
She pushes the end-of-day “memory flush” button. The tube
comes down from the ceiling.

INSIDE OUT
SADNESS

back from Joy)
Joy, no. That’s a core memory, Joy!

Joy tosses the blue core memory aside to collect the yellow
core memories.
Sadness grabs the blue core memory and heads to the Core
Memory Holder to plug it in. Joy lunges, knocking the blue
core memory out of Sadness’s hands. It’s SUCKED UP the vacuum
tube.
Joy trips backward. In the chaos a yellow core memory rolls
toward the tube.

No, no, no, no!

One, two, three... okay, got ’em.

Long-Term Memory...!
Joy grabs the core memories and jumps out of the dumpster.
She sees GOOFBALL ISLAND, silent and dark.

Hoh... Riley’s Islands of

personality islands and no-(gasp)

We’ll just have to go around! Take
the scenic route.
SADNESS
Wait! Joy, you could get lost in
there!
JOY
Think positive!
SADNESS
Okay. I’m positive you will get
lost in there. That’s Long-Term
Memory. An endless warren of
corridors and shelves. I read about
it in the manuals.
Joy stops. Sadness is right. But wait!
JOY
The manuals? The manuals! You read
the manuals!
Yeah...

SADNESS

JOY
So you know the way back to
headquarters!
SADNESS
I, guess...

57.

INSIDE OUT
JOY
You are my map! Let’s go! Lead on,
Mind Map! Show me where we’re
going!
SADNESS
Okay! Only, I’m too sad to walk.
Just give me a few... hours.
Joy grabs Sadness’ leg and DRAGS her into the shelves.
JOY
Which way? Left?
SADNESS
Right.
(Joy turns right)
No. I mean, go left. I said left
was right, like “correct.”
Okay.

JOY

SADNESS
This actually feels kind of nice.
Joy heads off into the COMPLICATED LABYRINTH ahead of them.
JOY
Okay! Here we go. We’ll be back to
Headquarters before morning. We can
do it. This’ll be easy. This is
working!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY - LATER
Joy, exhausted, drags Sadness through the maze of shelves.
JOY
This is not working. Are we getting
close?
SADNESS
Yeah. Just another right. And a
left. Then another left, and a
right...
JOY
Are you sure you know where we’re
going? Because we seem to be
walking AWAY from Headquarters--

58.

INSIDE OUT
The SKY BRIGHTENS. Day. And they’re still lost.
JOY (CONT’D)
Riley’s awake.
Joy drops a core memory. Sadness reaches to grab it.
JOY (CONT’D)
Ah ah ah, don’t touch, remember? If
you touch them, they stay sad!
SADNESS
Oh. Sorry. I won’t...
Joy looks behind her. The bottom row of memories are BLUE.
SADNESS (CONT’D)
...starting now.
JOY
I can’t take much more of this.
MALE FORGETTER (O.S.)
Forget ‘em!
JOY
Mind Workers!
Joy runs off toward the voice.
SADNESS
But Joy we’re almost... ohhhh.
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY - LATER
Joy finds two workers vacuuming up memories from the shelves.
FEMALE FORGETTER
Phone numbers. We don’t need all of
these. They’re in her phone.
MALE FORGETTER
Just forget all of that. Please.
Forget it!
JOY
Excuse me. Hi. I need to find
Friendship Island...
FEMALE FORGETTER
(pointing to memories)
Look at this. Four years of piano
lessons.

59.

INSIDE OUT
MALE FORGETTER
Yeah, looks pretty faded.
FEMALE FORGETTER
You know what? Save "Chopsticks”
and “Heart and Soul,” get rid of
the rest.
Zoop! The memories get vacuumed up.
Are you--

JOY

FEMALE FORGETTER
U.S. Presidents. What do you think?
MALE FORGETTER
Eh, just keep Washington, Lincoln
and the fat one.
FEMALE FORGETTER
Forget ‘em!
JOY
Hey! You can’t throw those away!
Those are perfectly good memories.
MALE FORGETTER
The names of every “Cutie Pie
Princess” doll?
JOY
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, Honeypants, Officer
Justice...
FEMALE FORGETTER
Forget ‘em!
He vacuums up the memories behind Joy.
EXT. CLIFFSIDE - CONTINUOUS
The memories shoot out a sewer pipe and fall into the
darkness of the Memory Dump.
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY - CONTINUOUS
JOY
Hey! Bring those back.

60.

INSIDE OUT
FEMALE FORGETTER
They’re in the dump. Nothing comes
back from the dump.
MALE FORGETTER
Yeah. Look lady, this is our job,
OK?
FEMALE FORGETTER
When Riley doesn’t care about a
memory, it fades.
Fades?

JOY

FEMALE FORGETTER
Happens to the best of ‘em.
MALE FORGETTER
(pulls memory from a cart)
Except for this bad boy! This one
will NEVER fade.
JOY
(recognizing it)
The song from the gum commercial?
MALE FORGETTER
(conspiratorial)
Sometimes we send that one up to
headquarters for no reason.
FEMALE FORGETTER
It just plays in Riley’s head over
and over again. Like a million
times! Ha! Let’s watch it again!
She rewinds it and plays it again. They sing along.
MALE FORGETTER
Tripledent gum will make you smile!
Tripledent gum! It lasts a while!
Tripledent gum will help you,
mister, to punch bad breath right
in the kisser.
JOY
We all know the song. Okay. Yup.
Real catchy.
MALE FORGETTER
(to Female Forgetter)
What do ya think? Should we do it?

61.

INSIDE OUT
FEMALE FORGETTER
Yeah! Ha ha!
MALE FORGETTER
OK, here we go! Ha ha ha!
He tips the gum memory into the inner workings of the shelf.
FWOOM! It shoots up towards Headquarters.
INT. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
Fear, Anger and Disgust are having a peaceful morning. The
memory drops into Headquarters, playing at full volume.
GUM MEMORY
Tripledent gum will make you smile!
Tripledent gum! It lasts a while-ANGER
Wha-- this again!?!
INT. LONG-TERM MEMORY
The Forgetters walk away, laughing and singing.
JOY
(following them)
Wait! Do you know how to get to
Friendship Island?!
INT. RILEY’S ROOM - DAY
Riley, laptop on her stomach, hums the Tripledent gum song.
MEG (O.S.)
(on the computer)
Do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge
cool?
RILEY
Yeah, it’s good. What happened with
the playoffs?
MEG
We won the first game. Coach says
we might actually go to the finals
this year. Oh, and we’ve got this
new girl on the team. She’s so
cool.

62.

INSIDE OUT
INT. HEADQUARTERS
DISGUST
Oh, she did NOT just say that.
FEAR
A NEW GIRL? Meg has a new friend
already?!
Anger GROWLS.
DISGUST
Hey hey, stay happy! We do NOT want
to lose any more islands here guys!
INT. RILEY’S ROOM
MEG
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking. It’s like
mind reading!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
ANGER
You like to read minds, Meg? I got
something for you to read right here!
(grabbing the controls)
DISGUST
No no no, what are you doing?!
FEAR
Wait, wait-- let’s just be calm for
one second-Anger snaps Fear’s nose like a rubber band. Anger slams the
controls forward like a lunatic.
ANGER
GAAAAAA!!!!
INT. RILEY’S ROOM
MEG (O.S.)
I heard they have parrots living inRILEY
I gotta go.

63.

INSIDE OUT
What?

MEG

RILEY
I GOTTA GO.
Riley slams down the computer and SCOWLS.
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY
Joy follows the Forgetters, trying to get directions. They
ignore her, singing the gum-commercial jingle.
A horrible mechanical GROANING sound. Joy reacts.
What...?

JOY

EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY
Joy rounds a corner and sees Friendship Island crumbling.
JOY
Friendship Island?
The FRIENDSHIP CORE MEMORY Joy holds fades. She runs forward.
Wh-- ?

JOY (CONT’D)

She looks on in horror as Friendship Island falls.
JOY (CONT’D)
Ohh, not Friendship.
Joy hugs the core memories. One of them is memory of young
Riley and Meg walking together.
SADNESS
Oh, Riley loved that one. And now
it's GONE. Goodbye friendship,
hello loneliness.
Joy sees Hockey Island in the distance.
JOY
(trying to stay positive)
We’ll just have to go the long way.
They turn to look back into the deep memory shelves.

64.

INSIDE OUT
SADNESS
Yeah. The long, long, looong way.
I’m ready.
Sadness lies down on the ground, offering her leg. Joy sighs.
She doesn’t want to do this again.
JOY
Ah, yes.
(pulling Sadness)
There’s gotta be a better way.
BING BONG (O.S.)
(talking to the memories)
Ohhh, look at you, you’re a KEEPER!
Huh?

JOY

Joy sees a strange figure up ahead, gathering memories.
BING BONG
I will take you, but not you.
(beat)
Oh who am I kidding, I can’t leave
you!
Hello!

JOY

The figure sees Joy -- and bolts.
JOY (CONT’D)
Wait! Hey, wait! Stop!
Joy chases after him.
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY DEAD END
Joy rounds a corner to find the figure crouched on the
ground, hiding his face in his hands like a three year old.
JOY
Excuse me...?
BING BONG
(jumping up; cornered)
Ahhhh! Uh, I was looking for, uh-(grabs a memory)
--DIVERSION!
He THROWS IT and makes a run for it.

65.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Ha ha! So long, sucker!
He immediately crashes into a cart of memories.
Ow!

BING BONG (CONT’D)
Oww, I hurt all over.

JOY
Wait. I know you.
BING BONG
No you don’t. I get that a lot, I
look like a lot of people.
JOY
No, I do! Bing Bong! Riley’s
Imaginary Friend!
BING BONG
You really DO know me!
JOY
Well of course! Riley loved playing
with you, you two were best
friends! Oh! You would know. We’re
trying to get back to
Headquarters...
BING BONG
Headquarters? You guys are from
Headquarters?
JOY
(mock modesty)
Well, yeah. I’m Joy. This is
Sadness.
BING BONG
You’re Joy? THE Joy?
Mm-hmm.

JOY

BING BONG
Well what the heck are you doing
out here?
JOY
That's a good question! You want to
answer that, Sadness?

66.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG
Without you, Riley won’t ever be
happy. We can't have that, we gotta
get you back! I’ll tell you what,
follow me.
JOY
Oh, thank you!
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY
Bing Bong leads them on through the memory shelves.
JOY
It is so great to see you again. I
gotta tell you, I am such a huge
fan of your work. Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?
FLASH CUTS of their adventures:
*Riley bangs on pots and pans, Bing Bong plays his trunk.
JOY (V.O.)
I went to all of your concerts.
BING BONG (V.O.)
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.
*Bing Bong runs on ceiling, Riley chases after him.
JOY (V.O.)
Watching you play tag was such a
treat.
BING BONG (V.O.)
Two-time world champ.
*Riley and Bing Bong sit in her wagon (”rocket”).
JOY (V.O.)
Oh, and remember your rocket?!
BING BONG (V.O.)
Of course! It runs on song power.
JOY
That’s right, your theme song!
(singing)
Who's your friend who likes to
play?

67.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG
(sings)
BING BONG BING BONG!
JOY
His rocket makes you yell “Hooray!”
BING BONG/JOY
BING BONG BING BONG!
Sadness eyes Bing Bong, who is a pink elephant made with a
cat tail.
SADNESS
What exactly are you supposed to
be?
BING BONG
You know, it’s unclear. I’m mostly
cotton candy, but shape-wise, I’m
part cat, part elephant, part
dolphin.
Dolphin?

JOY

Bing Bong does a spot-on dolphin impression.
BING BONG
You gotta remember, when Riley was
three, animals were all the rage.
The cow goes moo. The horse goes
neigh. That’s all people talked
about back then.
JOY
Yeah, I guess that’s true. What are
you doing out here?
BING BONG
Well, there’s not much call for
imaginary friends lately, so, uh,
you know, I’m...
JOY
Hey, hey, don’t be sad. Tell you
what, when I get back up to
Headquarters, I’ll make sure Riley
remembers you.
You will?!

BING BONG

68.

INSIDE OUT
JOY
Of course, she’d love that!
BING BONG
Ha ha! This is the greatest day of
my life!
He launches into a jig, but hurts himself and bursts into
tears. Candy pours out of his tear ducts.
JOY
Are you okay?
SADNESS
What’s going on?
BING BONG
I cry candy. Try the caramel, it’s
delicious.
JOY
Ooo.
(fumbles memories)
Woah!
BING BONG
Oh-- here-- use this.
(offers his satchel)
Thanks!

JOY

BING BONG
Oh, hold on. Wait a second.
He empties out an impossible amount of stuff: tons of
memories, a boot, an anchor, a cat... Joy and Sadness stare
in amazement.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
What? It’s imaginary.
Joy accepts the satchel and puts in the core memories.
JOY
Thanks! This’ll make it a lot
easier to walk back to
Headquarters.
BING BONG
Walk? We’re not walkin’! We’re
taking the Train of Thought!
He points to the train speeding towards Headquarters.

69.

INSIDE OUT
JOY
The train, of course! That is so
much faster! But how do we catch
it?
BING BONG
Well, it kind of goes all over the
place, but there is a station in
Imaginationland. I know a short
cut. Come on, this way!
JOY
I’m so glad we ran into you!
A giant BUILDING blocks their progress. Bing Bong opens a
door. It’s dark inside.
BING BONG
The station is right through here.

The train station is visible through a door on the other side.
After you.
Joy...
What?

BING BONG (CONT’D)
SADNESS
JOY

SADNESS
I read about this place in the
manual. We shouldn’t go in there.
JOY
Bing Bong says it’s the quickest
way to Headquarters.
SADNESS
No, but Joy, this is Abstract
Thought.
BING BONG
What’re you talking about? I go in
here all the time. It’s a shortcut,
see?
He points to a “Danger” sign above the door.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
D-A-N-G-E-R: shortcut. I’ll prove
it to you.
(he climbs in)
(MORE)

70.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Look at me! I’m closer to the
station ‘cause I’m taking the
shortcut!
SADNESS
Let’s go around. This way.
She points: the building is huge -- it’s a long way around.
BING BONG
Almost there...!
Joy looks back at Bing Bong.

The station is right there.

JOY
(to Sadness)
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it. But Riley needs to be
happy. I‘m not missing that train.
(walks in)
Bing Bong knows what he’s doing.
He's part dolphin. They're very
smart.
SADNESS
Well, I guess...
She climbs in.
EXT. SCHOOL LUNCH YARD - LUNCHTIME
Riley carries her lunch tray outside. The yard is full of
chatty, happy kids, but Riley finds an empty bench and eats
by herself.
EXT. ABSTRACT THOUGHT BUILDING - HATCH DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Two Mind Workers approach the same door our trio entered.
ABSTRACT WORKER #1
Okay, what abstract concept are we
trying to comprehend today?
ABSTRACT WORKER #2
(checking a clipboard)
Um... loneliness.
ABSTRACT WORKER #1
Hm. Looks like there’s something in
there. I’m going to turn it on for
a minute and burn out the gunk.

71.

INSIDE OUT
She closes the door.
INT. ABSTRACT THOUGHT BUILDING
BING BONG
What’d I tell ya? You’ll be at
Headquarters in no time.
BAM! The door closes behind them. The LIGHTS GO ON.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Say, would you look at that!
Around them, strange SHAPES float into space.
JOY
Whoa! What's happening?!
SADNESS
Oh no. They turned it on.
BING BONG
Huh! I’ve never seen this before.
Bing Bong’s head turns into a Picasso-like form. Joy and
Sadness scream as they become Cubist versions of themselves.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
My face! My beautiful face!
JOY
What is going on?
SADNESS
We’re abstracting! There are four
stages. This is the first: nonobjective fragmentation!
BING BONG
Alright, do not panic! What is
important is that we all STAY
TOGETHER.
His arm falls off.
Ah!

JOY

Joy’s head falls off. Sadness’ leg goes. She topples.
SADNESS
We’re in the second stage: we’re
deconstructing!

72.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG

Run!

Bing Bing falls into pieces.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Aaah! I can’t feel my legs!
(his disassembled arm finds
them)
Oh, there they are.
JOY
Come here, me!
They gather their pieces as they rush to the exit.
SADNESS
We’ve gotta get out of here before
we’re nothing but shape and color!
We’ll get stuck here forever!
JOY
“Stuck?!” Why did we come in here?!
BING BONG
I told you, it’s a shortcut!
Though the window, the TRAIN OF THOUGHT pulls in.
The train!

JOY

POP! They change into FLAT COLOR VERSIONS of themselves.
SADNESS
Oh no... We’re two-dimensional!
That’s stage three!
JOY
We’re getting nowhere!
BING BONG
Depth! I’m lacking depth!
It’s hard to move.
Come on!

They struggle towards the window.
JOY

Sadness and Bing Bong follow and try to squeeze through. But
because of the broken perspective, they are now all HUGE
compared to the door.

73.

INSIDE OUT
JOY (CONT’D)
AUGH! We can’t fit!
POP! They abstract into ABSTRACT COLORED BLOBS.
SADNESS
Oh no, we’re nonfigurative. This is
the last stage!
BING BONG
We’re not going to make it!
Sadness slumps to the ground... and becomes a line!
SADNESS
Wait! We’re two dimensional. Fall
on your face!
(crawls like an inchworm)
Oh!

JOY

They follow Sadness and inch safely out the window.
EXT. ABSTRACT THOUGHT BUILDING
The three lines land outside just as the train pulls out.
They get up to go, but as lines they can barely move.
JOY
Wait! Stop! Stop! STOP!
POP! Joy goes from non-representational to two-dimensional.
She falls down flat as the train speeds off.
POP! The three transform back to normal.
JOY (CONT’D)
(to Bing Bong)
I thought you said that was a
shortcut.
BING BONG
I did, but wow, we should NOT have
gone in there. That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.
JOY
How long till the next train?
BING BONG
Who knows? But don’t worry. There’s
another station. That way!
(MORE)

74.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG (CONT'D)
(points O.S.)
The train always stops there right
before it goes to Headquarters. If
we hurry, we can catch it!
JOY
This isn’t another one of your
short cuts, is it?
BING BONG
(laughing exuberantly)
Yeah!
Joy skeptically watches him head off.
JOY
(to Sadness)
Is there really another station?
SADNESS
Uh-huh. Through there.
Bing Bong leads them towards the impressive gates of...
BING BONG
Welcome to Imaginationland!
INT. IMAGINATIONLAND - CONTINUOUS
JOY
Imaginationland?
BING BONG
Sure! I come here all the time. I’m
practically the mayor. Hey, you
guys hungry? There’s French Fry
Forest!
(starts eating)
Nom nom nom, delicious!
Joy is loving this.
No way!

JOY

BING BONG
Check it out! Trophy Town! Medals!
Ribbons! Everyone’s a winner!
Bing Bong kicks a soccer ball into a giant goal and workers
appear out of nowhere to shower him with awards.

75.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG (CONT’D)
I won first place!
Workers give Joy a medal and Sadness a ribbon.
Me too!

JOY

SADNESS
Hohh... Participation award...
JOY
Wait, is that-- Sadness, look, it’s
Cloud Town! That is my favorite!
Joy rips off a chunk of cloud and floats up into the air.
JOY (CONT’D)
It's so soft!
Joy jumps down and runs off.
BING BONG
Woah! Let me try!
Bing Bong rips off some cloud. A CLOUD MAN emerges from the
house, angry.
CLOUD MAN
Hey! What’s the big idea? You’d
better fix that wall, or else
you’re in big troub-POOF! Bing Bong blows the Cloud Man away and walks off
nervously.
EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND, LAVA DAYDREAM
Joy and Bing Bong gleefully jump between couch cushions.
JOY
Oh no, lava! Whooo!

BING BONG
Whawhoooo! Imaginationland is
the best!

Sadness tries to jump to a rock, barely makes it.
SADNESS
Is it all going to be so
interactive?

BING BONG
Hey, look! The House of Cards!!
Ooh, wait, hang on just a minute...
From a nearby garage made of cards, Bing Bong pulls a wagon.
JOY
Your rocket!
BING BONG
Yeah! I stashed it in there for
safekeeping. Now I’m all set to
take Riley to the MOON!
He gestures proudly -- accidentally knocking over the house.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Oh, I’m sorry.
Great.

HOUSE OF CARDS WORKER

EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND
JOY
I love Imaginationland!
BING BONG
Isn’t it great? And there’s always
something new, like...
A giant machine. A conveyer belt reveals a handsome teenager.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Who the heck is that?
BOYFRIEND GENERATOR WORKER
Imaginary Boyfriend.
IMAGINARY BOYFRIEND
I would die for Riley.
Joy grimaces.
BING BONG
I’ve never seen him before.

INT. HOCKEY RINK - BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS
Mom and Riley sit on the bleachers.

San Francisco. Heh heh!
HOCKEY COACH (O.S.)
Okay Andersen, you're up!
RILEY
I gotta go.
Riley heads onto the ice.
MOM
Okay. Good luck, sweetie!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
DISGUST
Luck isn’t gonna help us now. If
she tries to use Hockey Island,
it’s going down.
FEAR
Which is why I’ve recalled every
hockey memory I can think of.
The Emotions are standing ankle deep in memories.
FEAR (CONT’D)
One of these has got to work in
place of the core memory.
O.S. Hockey whistle.
ANGER/DISGUST
She’s about to play!/Hurry!

Fear loads a memory into the core holder.
INT. HOCKEY RINK
Riley skates onto the ice.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Out the window, Hockey Island lights up feebly.
FEAR
Ha ha! We did it gang! It’s working-BOOM! The Core Memory Holder ejects a memory, slamming Anger
in the face. Hockey Island shakes. Fear SHRIEKS.
INT. HOCKEY RINK
Riley struggles to dribble the puck.
HOCKEY COACH
Line change! Line change! Change it
up! Change it up!
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Fear frantically loads memories into the Holder, which spits
them out like dodge balls. Disgust and Anger run for cover.
The Holder spins furiously, flinging Fear against the window.
Memories pelt him.
DISGUST

It’s like we don't learn anything.
INT. HOCKEY RINK

Let’s pick it up out there!
Riley attempts to slap the puck, misses, and TRIPS.

Riley angrily throws her stick to the ice and skates off.
The other players stop and watch.
INT. HOCKEY RINK - BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS

Riley heads to the stands and removes her skates.

Riley, what’s wrong?
Let’s go.

RILEY

MOM
You’re not going to finish tryouts?
RILEY
What’s the point?
MOM
Hey, it’ll be alright. Let’s just-RILEY
Stop saying everything will be
alright!
Riley stomps towards the exit. She looks back at the rink.
All the players cheer and high five.
Riley turns away from the rink and walks out.
INT. IMAGINATIONLAND, PRESCHOOL WORLD ENTRANCE
Boom! Joy turns around and watches Hockey Island crumble.
JOY
Hockey? Oh no... no, she loves

Bing Bong, we have to get to that
station.
BING BONG
Sure thing. This way, just past
Graham Cracker Castle. Hey. That’s
weird. Graham Cracker Castle used
to be right here. I wonder why they
moved it?
He walks on, concerned, LEAVING HIS WAGON BEHIND HIM.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Wow, that’s not... I would have
sworn Sparkle Pony Mountain was
right here. Hey, what’s going on?
JOY
Yeah, yeah, I dunno, we’ll have to
come back-BING BONG
Princess Dream World!
A wrecking ball hits a pink castle. Glitter dust plumes.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Oh no! The Stuffed Animal Hall of
Fame!
RIIIP! The head of a bear comes off. Too late, Bing Bong
notices some construction workers CARRYING AWAY HIS ROCKET.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
My rocket!
(running after them)
Wait! Riley and I, we’re still
using that rocket! It still has
some song power left!!
(sings)
Who's your friend who likes to
play?
THE ROCKET RESPONDS weakly, propelling it forward. The
workers toss it onto a junk pile. A bulldozer pushes the pile
towards the CLIFF EDGE.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Nooo!!! No! No! No! You can’t take my
rocket to the dump! Riley and I are
going to the MOON! Ahhh!

INSIDE OUT
Over it goes, into the darkness.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Riley can’t be done with me.
Bing Bong sits, stunned.

Joy approaches gingerly.

JOY
Hey, it’s going to be okay. We can
fix this! We just need to get back
to Headquarters. Which way to the
train station?
BING BONG
(still stunned)
I had a whole trip planned for us.
Joy tries another tactic.
JOY
Hey, who’s ticklish, huh? Here
comes the tickle monster...
No response.
JOY (CONT’D)
Hey! Bing Bong, look at this!
Dohoioih!
She makes a silly face. Nothing.
JOY (CONT’D)
Oh, here’s a fun game! You point to
the train station and we all go
there! Won’t that be fun? Come on,
let’s go to the train station!
Joy walks off, attempting to lead.
SADNESS

I’m sorry they took your rocket.
They took something that you loved.

BING BONG
They were wonderful. Once we flew
back in time. We had breakfast
twice that day.
SADNESS
That’s sounds amazing. I bet Riley
liked it.
BING BONG
Oh she did. We were best friends.
SADNESS
Yeah. It’s sad.
Bing Bong puts his head on Sadness’ shoulder and CRIES.
Sadness keeps her arm around him until he’s done.
BING BONG
I’m okay now.
(stands)
C’mon, the train station is this
way.
He walks off. Joy and Sadness follow.
JOY
How did you do that?

I don’t know. He was sad, so I
listened to what-BING BONG (O.S.)
Hey, there’s the train!
INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY
Our trio climb aboard just as the train moves.

FEAR
Like quitting! That’s what I’m
doing.
He stomps on the recall button.
FEAR (CONT’D)
Sure, it’s the coward’s way out.
But this coward is gonna survive!
The tube drops over him, but pummels Fear with dozens of
memories. The tube shuts off and retracts. Fear drops to the

Emotions can’t quit, genius.
Fear spits up a memory.

Oh nothing. Just the best idea ever.

DISGUST

ANGER
All the good core memories were
made in Minnesota. Ergo, we go back
to Minnesota and make more. Ta-da!
FEAR
Wait. You’re saying we run away?
ANGER
Well, I wouldn’t call it that. I’d
call it, “The Happy Core Memory
Development Program.”
FEAR
You can’t be serious.
ANGER
Hey. Our life was perfect until Mom
and Dad decided to move to San Fran
Stinktown.
FEAR
But, I mean, it’s just so drastic!
ANGER
Need I remind you of how great
things were there? Our room? Our
back yard? Our friends?

GUM MEMORY
Tripledent gum will make you smile!
Tripledent gum it lasts--

Riley was happier in Minnesota...

Rainbow Unicorn! She’s RIGHT THERE!
Joy tries to play it cool as they walk past.
SADNESS
My friend says you’re famous. She
wants your autograph.
JOY
No, no, Sadness, don’t bother Miss
Unicorn, okay?

Sorry, she’s from outta town. So

He gives her the satchel. Joy holds them close.
BING BONG
All he cared about was the candy!
Joy helps Bing Bong squeeze through, but the balloon-bars
make loud twisting noises. Jangles stirs. Joy freezes. She
stretches them further...
Success! Joy and Bing Bong hurry down and the trio rush away.

ANGER
You idiot! It was a DREAM! This is
ridiculous, we can’t even get a

Stupid Mom and Dad. If they hadn't

Sorry. I went sad again, didn’t I?

Riley spots Mom’s purse on the table.
MOM (CONT’D)

Riley opens the purse.
MOM (O.S) (CONT’D)
Well, we were promised delivery on

SADNESS
Joy! Joy! It’s too dangerous! We

EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY CLIFFS
Family Island rumbles. A LARGE CHUNK of cliff edge breaks off
behind them, driving Joy and Sadness forward.
JOY
Go! Run! RUN!
Joy steps into the disconnected TUBE, ready to sail up to
Headquarters.
Sadness tries to climb in, but there’s not enough room; she
jostles, pressing against the satchel. The CORE MEMORIES
start to turn blue.
JOY (CONT’D)
Woah woah! Sadness!
(pushing her back)
Sadness, stop! You’re hurting
Riley!
Joy pulls a core memory from the satchel. It is BRIGHT BLUE,

She pulls the tube closed and starts up alone.
Sadness and Bing Bong watch, betrayed and despondent.
Joy looks guilt-ridden, but looks on towards Headquarters.

Off in another part of the dump, Bing Bong comes to.

Joy ignores him; keeps trying.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Don’t you get it, Joy? We’re stuck
down here. We’re forgotten.
This stops Joy. All around, memories are fading to dust.
Vapors blowing in the atmosphere, they disappear.
RILEY (O.S.)
We used to play tag and stuff.
Joy recognizes this. She finds Sadness’ BLUE CORE MEMORY:
Riley crying in class.
RILEY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
But everything’s different now
since we moved.
Seeing Riley cry breaks Joy’s heart. She falls to her knees.
She picks up a nearby MEMORY of young happy Riley coloring.
JOY
Do you remember how she used to
stick her tongue out when she was
coloring?
Another memory: Riley talking to a bug.
JOY (CONT’D)
I could listen to her stories all
day.
Another memory: Riley spinning.
JOY (CONT'D)
I just wanted Riley to be happy.
And now...
She holds the recent blue memory of Riley in class.
them all until the memories fall out of her arms.

Joy hugs

Joy cries. A long, deep, painful cry.
Joy has lost everything.
Around her, memories fade and disappear.
A tear falls onto the faded TWISTY-TREE MEMORY. Joy wipes it.

109.

INSIDE OUT
In wiping the tear, the memory rewinds. Its color CHANGES
from GOLD TO BLUE.
IN THE MEMORY: Riley sits in the tree with her parents, the
team approaching in the distance.
Joy looks closer. What’s this? She rewinds more.
IN THE MEMORY: Riley sits in the tree, crying, alone.
Joy remembers what Sadness said about the memory...
SADNESS (V.O.)
It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game. Riley
missed the winning shot. She felt
awful. She wanted to quit.
IN THE MEMORY: Mom and Dad come to console Riley.
Joy fast forwards.
IN THE MEMORY: The hockey team lifts Riley on their shoulders
and cheers. Riley smiles.
JOY
Sadness. Mom and Dad, the team...
they came to help because of
Sadness.
She turns to Bing Bong, ready to take action.
JOY (CONT’D)
We have to get back up there!
BING BONG
Joy, we’re stuck down here. We
might as well be on another planet.
JOY
(getting an idea)
Another planet.
(sings)
Who’s your friend who likes to
play?
Silence.
JOY (CONT’D)
(sings louder)
Who’s your friend who likes to
play?

110.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG
(understanding; excited)
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Far off, BING BONG’S ROCKET answers. They run towards it.
BING BONG (CONT’D)
Who's the best in every way and
wants to sing this song to say,
who's your friend who likes to
play? Bing Bong Bing Bong!
Joy and Bing Bong find the rocket!
EXT. MEMORY DUMP - LATER
They perch the wagon atop a hill. Joy looks resigned.
Hop in!

JOY

Both inside, Bing Bong pushes off. They speed down a slope to
gain momentum, singing all the way. They reach the bottom and
shoot up another hill, launching up towards the cliff top.
Joy and Bing Bong enthusiastically, if not desperately, sing
at the top of their lungs.
Not even close. They crash back to the bottom.
C’mon!

JOY (CONT’D)

EXT. MEMORY DUMP - MOMENTS LATER
They shoot down a taller hill for another go. They SING
faster and louder.
Joy reaches for the ledge but they fall with a thud.
Bing Bong stands. There’s no way they’ll make it. He looks
up at the ledge and then to his hand -- it’s disappearing!
BING BONG
Come on, Joy. One more time. I’ve
got a feeling about this one.
EXT. MEMORY DUMP - MOMENTS LATER
Hurdling down the largest hill yet, they continue to sing
Bing Bong’s song.

111.

INSIDE OUT
BING BONG
Louder! Louder, Joy! Sing louder!
Bing Bong times it just right... and jumps out of the wagon.
Without his weight, the Joy gains momentum. She’s unaware of
Bing Bong’s absence.
JOY
We’re gonna make it!
The rocket makes it over the ledge! It crashes atop the
cliff.
JOY (CONT'D)
Woohoo! Bing Bong, we did it! We-She turns around. She’s alone.
JOY (CONT'D)
Bing Bong? Bing Bong!
She runs to the cliff side. Below, Bing Bong laughs
excitedly, happy to help Riley in the only way he can.
BING BONG
Ya ha ha! You made it! Ha ha! Go!
Go save Riley!
(pause)
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?
He waves as the last of him vanishes into the air. Joy’s eyes
widen in awe; he’s sacrificed his life for her.
JOY
I'll try, Bing Bong. I promise.
Joy gets up and soldiers on.
INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - EVENING
Mom and Dad walk in.

EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY
Joy runs through a long corridor.
JOY
Sadness? Sadness?
(no answer; desperate)
C’mon Sadness, where are you? Okay.
If I were Sadness, where would I be?
Joy slumps to the ground. She kicks a leg up in the air.
JOY (CONT'D)
(Sadness voice)
Ohhh... everything is awful and my
legs don’t work and you have to
drag me around while I touch all
the-Joy stops. Something has caught her eye.
REVEAL: a path of blue memories on the bottom shelves.
Joy follows the path.
EXT. BUS DEPOT - MOMENT LATER
Riley walks out of the bus depot and into the advancing line.
Her cell phone rings again: “Mom.”
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Fear breathes faster into his paper bag.
DISGUST
Oh no. It’s Mom again. What do we
do?!
ANGER
Uh... Uh...
Boom! Family Island rumbles behind them.
QUICK INTERCUTS between the line getting shorter, Riley
declining Mom’s call, and Family Island crumbling. Finally...

Sadness turns around.
Joy?

SADNESS

Inexplicably, Sadness turns and runs away.
JOY
Wait, Sadness!
Joy chases after her. Sadness doesn’t stop.
SADNESS
Just let me go! Riley’s better off
without me!
Joy follows Sadness straight into...
INT. IMAGINATIONLAND, FRENCH FRY FOREST

INSIDE OUT
INT. IMAGINATIONLAND, CLOUD TOWN
Two MIND WORKER COPS are questioning a CLOUD WITNESS.
MIND WORKER COP #1
So you’re saying your husband was
blown away by an elephant.
The Cloud Witness nods. Sadness runs past the crime scene.
They don’t notice.
MIND WORKER COP #1 (CONT’D)
Was he with anyone?
CLOUD WITNESS
Yes! And there she is!
Joy runs right through the Cloud Witness, dissipating her.
MIND WORKER COP #1
(runs after Joy)
Hey! Come back here!
MIND WORKER COP #2
Forget it, Jake. It’s Cloud Town.
EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND, CLIFF EDGE
Joy searches for Sadness. Suddenly, rain falls on her. Above,
Sadness is floating on a chunk of rain cloud, away from
Headquarters.
JOY
What? Sadness!
SADNESS
(crying)
I only make everything worse!
JOY
Wait-- Sadness! We've gotta get you
back to...

Ugh.
Joy looks back at Family Island crumbling. She looks around:

A strange BLACKNESS spreads over the console.

Oh, no, no, no. What is THIS?!
INT. BUS - EVENING
Riley boards the bus.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
Anger slams a chair down on the console. It bounces off with
no effect. Fear lunges in with a crowbar. He loses control
and it smacks him in the face.

Riley walks down the aisle of the bus.
INT. HEADQUARTERS
FEAR
Oh, how do we stop it?
DISGUST

IMAGINARY BOYFRIEND
I would die for Riley! I would die

Yeah, yeah, okay, Haircut. Time to

Imaginary Boyfriends pour out, directly into Joy’s satchel.
EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND
Joy spots Sadness ahead, and runs past her.
EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND, BALLOON TREES
Joy pulls a balloon free from a TWISTY BALLOON PALM TREE. She
aims it towards the approaching Sadness and unties it.
PTHHPT! The balloon blows Sadness back over the MEMORY DUMP.
In the process, the HOUSE OF CARDS behind them collapses.
HOUSE OF CARDS WORKER
(angry)
That’s it! I fold!
EXT. IMAGINATIONLAND, BOYFRIEND GENERATOR
Joy sprints by grabbing the SATCHEL, now full of boyfriends.

Sadness floats out over the Memory Dump. Joy runs along the
cliff edge, parallel to Sadness, towards Family Island.
EXT. LONG-TERM MEMORY CLIFFS, NEAR FAMILY ISLAND
Joy sights Sadness and aligns herself with Family Island. She
dumps the satchel, pouring out the Boyfriends. Their momentum
pulls her to the top of a TOWER OF BOYFRIENDS.

This is crazy, this is crazy... No,
no, no! Joy! Be positive.

I am POSITIVE this is crazy!

grabbing the window edge. The Emotions run to the window.
It’s Joy!

DISGUST

ANGER
Stand back! Arrrrgh!
Anger throws a chair at the window. It bounces off.
DISGUST

That worked.
ANGER
Well, what would you do, if you’re
so smart?!
He’s smoldering. Disgust’s eyes light up.

120.

INSIDE OUT
DISGUST
I’d tell you, but you’re too dumb
to understand.
What?!

ANGER

DISGUST
Of course your tiny brain is
confused. Guess I’ll just have to
dumb it down to your level. Sorry I
don’t speak “moron” as well as you,
but let me try: Duuuuhhhhh.
Anger explodes, bursting into full blowtorch flames. Disgust,
sporting a welding mask, picks him up and blows a hole in the
window. Joy and Sadness climb through.
Anger Fear and Disgust all talk at the same time, explaining:
FEAR
Oh, thank goodness you’re back.
DISGUST
Things are really messed up.
