INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
THE FARMER (52,although the years have not been kind to him)
stares out the window onto the fields. A scarecrow stands in
the distance protecting the crops around him.
The Farmer scours the fields as he spots another scarecrow
who stands on the field with nothing but greenery around
him.
The Farmer continues to look around and suddenly stops. His
expression changes as he slightly drops his head.
A scarecrow stands on the field slightly nearer to the
farmhouse than the others. A few crows gather around him
pecking on the crops near him.
The Farmer closes his eyes. A hand appears on his shoulder
offering some comfort as the Farmers wife appears from
behind him.
FARMERS WIFE
Give him time.
The farmer places his hand on top of his wives hand.
THE FARMER
I'm not sure we have any.
The Farmers head drops.
The Farmer turns and walks away from the window leaving the
Farmers wife watch on out onto the field.
The Farmer approaches a kitchen drawer and opens it up. He
pulls out a velvet bag and holds it momentarily before
placing it back in the drawer.
The Farmer puts on his coat and grabs a shotgun that stands
next to the door.
The Farmer exits the farmhouse.
The Farmers wife who remains staring out onto the field
watches on as we see from the reflection of the window as
the Farmer approaches The scarecrow (JACK). The farmer lifts
the shotgun into the air and fires. The crows fly off. The
Farmers wife has a tear falling down her cheek before she
can no longer watch and moves away from the window.
WIDE SHOT: THE FARMER WALKS AWAY FROM JACK AND RETURNS BACK
TO THE FARMHOUSE WITH JACK ALONE ON THE FIELD.

The Farmers wife enters warily, she rubs her eyes. She picks
the kettle up and walks over to the tap, she fills the
kettle and looks out of the window.
Her expression changes suddenly.
She drops the kettle to the floor which creates a loud bang.
She begins to slowly walk away from the window.
The Farmer rushes into the kitchen.
THE FARMER
What's going on?
The farmer's wife doesn't reply and she continues to stare
out of the window.

alongside his wife.
No.

EXT. HIGH STREET - DAY
JACK walks down a busy street, a number of people stop and
stare at him as he obliviously walks on.
We get to see Jack close up. His body filled with hay and a
potato bag as his face with eyes stitched on and a mouth
made up of three buttons in a line.
Jack looks over at a young boy who is being pestered by some
pigeons and looks rather frightened.
Jack makes his way over to help the boy and scare the
pigeons but they do not move.
The boy runs off to his Mum and Dad crying.
Jack slowly turns away and walks on.
EXT. HIGH STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Jack comes to a shop with an advertisement on the window.
"Shop assistant needed, please apply within".
Jack notices the advertisement and reaches in to his pocket,
pulls out the velvet bag which he begins to undo.

advert from the window.
Jack drops his head, places the velvet bag back in his
pocket and walks on.

Jack is scouring a notice board which has hundreds of jobs
on it. There is no work for Scarecrows.

Jack sits on a park bench alone. He seems lost in the big
open world. A bird lands on his shoulder and pecks at him
before flying off again.

Jack walks down a dark street. His head is hung low. He
pulls a photograph from his pocket.
POV OF PHOTO: JACK IS STANDING WITH THE TWO OTHER SCARECROWS
AND THE FARMER ALL SMILING WITH THE FARMER PLACED IN THE
MIDDLE WITH HIS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND THE THREE OF THEM.
A lowered sports car with tinted windows pulls up beside
Jack and slows down.
Jack quickly places the photograph back into his pocket.
The drivers window slowly comes down and reveals a rugged
looked man; early thirties smoking a cigarette.
RUGGED MAN

Jack, uncomfortable begins to pick up his pace.
The car speeds up slightly keeping up with Jack.

Slow down there big fella.

A car slows down and stops by CARMEL (28) who has her back
to the car. The window winds down and reveals a middle aged
man.
MIDDLE AGED MAN
Come over here love, let me see
you.
Carmel turns round and leans forward into the window.
As she tries her pretty persuasion we see the middle aged
man's face change to an expression of horror.

7.
MIDDLE AGED MAN
(Desperately winds window
up)
No thanks love, maybe another time.
Once the window is up the car pulls away and stops a little
further up the road where a colleague of hers leans in
before entering the car and speeds off out of sight.
Carmel turns round with a look of rejection. She has a
facial disfigurement where a scar runs from the corner of
her mouth up to her eye causing her mouth to be slightly out
of shape.
Carmel walks back to her space in the street ready for the
next punter.

Why me...Why did you choose me?
Jack reaches into his pocket and pulls out the small velvet
bag. He undoes it and pours two buttons into his hand. He
places the buttons onto each end of his mouth creating a
smile.

Jack, She grabs hold of Jacks hand and places it on her
face.
CARMEL

Careful!

and places it on the scarred corner of Carmel's mouth
creating a smile similar to his.

throws his cigarette to the ground as we see the car screech
off down the street.

are hiding in the shadows. Carmel reluctantly walks around
to the passengers side and gets in the car.
The sports car drives away.

Carmel looks nervous as she sits in the passenger seat. The
Rugged Man still looking at the road does not say a word.

Carmel takes a deep breath and looks ahead out the window.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
The Farmer who looks exhausted tries his luck with a few
local people showing them the photo of him with the
scarecrows. Getting no joy from anyone he approaches he

their heads. The Farmers expression changes to one of hope.
The male of the couple points in a direction to which the
Farmer thanks them and heads off in.

Nothing.

NUMBER OF HEAVY KNOCKS. THERE IS A PAUSE BEFORE THE KNOCKS
COME AGAIN. WE PAN OUT FROM THE DOOR AS IT FALLS SILENT.
THERE IS A HEAVY BANG BEFORE THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN.
Carmel stands in the doorway soaked in blood, clearly out of
breath.
THE BEDSIT IS EMPTY.
She is too late. She makes her way over to the cabinet next
to the bed where the small velvet bag sits on top.

of her hand.
She begins to cry.

CUT TO:

around self made fires or cuddled up in blankets. They all
give Jack a strange stare.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
The Farmer and Carmel walk the same streets in search of
Jack.

begins to fade. A small flicker of flame catches the hay of
Jack as he quickly puts it out before the unimaginable could
happen.

warmth.
The tramps simultaneously look at Jack who now feels a
little uncomfortable.
