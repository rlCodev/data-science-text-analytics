We see flashes of memory. A balloon in trouble. A man
falling.

*

Glints of sunlight through an ominous grey sky.

*

AMELIA WREN, late 20s with a hazardous expression, sits
behind the window of a fast moving carriage. She’s looking up
at the sky - and there’s pain mirrored in her eyes.

*

AMELIA WREN
Stop the carriage.
She bangs hard on the roof.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Stop the carriage.
The carriage is pulled to a stop.

AMELIA gets out of the carriage - she tumbles out in her need
to dismount with speed. She stands on the dirty street. She
tries to recover her composure. ANTONIA, her caring sister,
gets out of the carriage behind her.
On-screen title: LONDON, 1862.

ANTONIA
Amelia, are you quite well?
AMELIA looks at her.
ANTONIA (CONT’D)
You don’t need to fly today. Return
to Richmond with me...
AMELIA WREN
Antonia, I just need a moment.
ANTONIA
With all you’ve been through... Noone would think worse of you....
AMELIA WREN
I would. I would think worse of me.
I made an agreement with Mr
Glaisher.

ANTONIA
You barely know the man! And the
little you do know, you’re
irritated by.

AMELIA WREN
Antonia, please, just give me a
moment.

ANTONIA frowns and nods.
ANTONIA
Last piece of sisterly advice doubt is there to be listened to.

She re-enters the carriage.
AMELIA looks up at the sky. She thinks. She lies back on the
pavement, she takes a moment.
A man walks by and tuts disapprovingly, but AMELIA doesn’t
care. She looks up, ever up, and then she smiles.
TITLES OVER:
Behind AMELIA, in the back of shot, we see A BOY RUNNING
ALONG THE STREET.

EXT. VAUXHALL STREETS. LONDON. CONTINUOUS -

TITLES CONTINUE:
And now we’re with the 9 year old, a boot black in uniform,
as he runs, this is CHARLIE. He runs alongside dilapidated
slum terraced houses. He has a look of intensity on his face.
He approaches an intersection of busy streets. Filled with
carts, carriages, cows and horses. He runs straight across causing a carriage and a cart to take evasive action.
COACHMAN
Oi!
CHARLIE stops and turns, he dances this way and then dances
that. A smile on his face.
COACHMAN (CONT’D)
You little...
CHARLIE runs on.
On the other side of the road, he runs alongside a long queue
of people beside a wooden fence.
He runs through and past them all. He sees what he’s looking
for - a big sign ‘HISTORY MADE. HERE. TODAY. HOW HIGH CAN
THEY GO?” Above the sign sits a painted picture of a gas
balloon.

TICKET TOUT
The Widow Wren takes to the skies
to break the world record. Get your
tickets!
Next to the sign is a tall hedgerow. CHARLIE checks that he’s
not being watched, and then he ducks down through a gap in
the hedge, pushes through a hole in the fence behind, and
sneaks into the Gardens.

EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS -

TITLES CONTINUE:
Everywhere there are hordes of people - all moving in one
direction. There’s an air of anticipation and the chatter of
excitement.
CHARLIE weaves and dodges, passing food sellers,
Waveswingers, Revolving Chairs and Merry-Go-Rounds - stalls
and entertainment all put on to make the most of the occasion
(and maximize the money taken). But CHARLIE runs through it
all, determined.
Until he gets to the only thing he wants to see - the only
thing everyone wants to see - he looks up in awe towards:
An enormous red and white striped, silk air balloon. Bigger,
better, bolder than the picture on the sign.
93,000 cubic feet, 80 feet tall, and 55 feet wide, covered in
a vast rope webbing... It towers over the top of the fair.
This is the MAMMOTH. It is unlike any gas balloon you’ve
seen. And it is magnificent.
Charlie’s mouth gapes open, and then he smiles.

THE AERONAUTS
And we travel past CHARLIE, towards the balloon, it rests at
the centre of an amphitheatre type structure, filled with the
VAST CROWDS that have gathered to see the balloon rise.
Around the circumference of the balloon, 16 men hold guide
ropes to keep the Mammoth in place, with further ropes tied
to stakes in the earth. The basket has a temporary platform
surrounding it.

We settle on a man in the basket of the balloon stowing a
series of instruments and trying to ignore the fact that he
is at the centre of all the attention. This is JAMES
GLAISHER, 35, a man whose forensic attention to detail belies
the adventurer within.
He looks at his pocket watch, irritated, and then checks and
rechecks that the bindings on one of his barometers are
securely fastened - a job he’s clearly done a hundred times
already this morning.
Another man, JOHN TREW, bookish and loyal, ascends the
temporary wooden steps to the platform.
JAMES GLAISHER
She’s late.
JOHN TREW
She is, but that is the least of
your problems.
JAMES GLAISHER
We’ll lose the light...
JOHN TREW
James, do the clouds not look
ominous to you?
But JAMES doesn’t look at the clouds, he’s consumed, he
climbs out of the basket and checks his watch.
JAMES GLAISHER
I repeatedly explained the
importance of catching the right
light and the right wind at the
right time and JAMES turns to his bag, he begins to check further
instruments inside. Amongst them we see a compass, two
thermometers (a “dry” and a “wet” one, which is wrapped in a
muslin and submerged in water), a spectroscope, a magnet, a
barometer, and a hygrometer.
JOHN TREW
James. Look up.
JAMES looks up. He sees the dark clouds, he frowns.
JAMES GLAISHER
Not a concern, John, the readings I
took this morning were quite clear
that...

He bends to another basket. He puts some feed into it. The
pigeons inside coo appreciatively.
JOHN TREW
Far be it from me to doubt you, but
your weather predictions have been
wrong in the past and it’s just
possible...
NED (O.S.)
Don’t even think of it.
NED is a tall bald man with a dour face. JAMES looks at him
and smiles to mask a grimace.
JAMES GLAISHER
Ned Chambers, John Trew, my very
good friend. John this is Ned, one
of the hardy entrepreneurs who has
invested in our expedition JOHN leans down from the platform to shake NED’s hand. But
NED pays him no attention, he ascends the stairs to the
platform, looming over JAMES ominously.
NED
Don’t even think of telling me
flight is not possible.
JOHN TREW
Mr Chambers, we are scientists of
the air, and we can tell you the
one thing no-one can control is well - the air NED
I have paid for gas, I have paid
for silk - and is this balloon not
the strongest and largest that’s
ever been?
JOHN TREW
But even so it can’t fight the
weather, you do not want to be
responsible for a tragedy, Sir.
NED
I don’t wish to be responsible for
refunding the ten thousand who’ve
come here ‘cause you promised them
history and JAMES GLAISHER
(cutting in)
We’ll fly, Ned. We’ll fly.

JOHN TREW looks at his friend concerned, NED smiles. JAMES
GLAISHER meets eyes with NED.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
We only need the sky to hold for
ninety minutes - once we’re above
the cloud line, it will be fine.
NED
Good. That’s fixed. Now - did you
not promise me a five o’clock
ascent?
JAMES GLAISHER
I did. I am merely waiting for the
pilot. It’s not the first time
she’s kept me waiting.

*

NED smiles and walks away through the crowds. JAMES watches
him go and then looks up anxiously at the clouds.
JOHN TREW
What a truly pleasant man JAMES - deliberately not looking up - starts to load a series
of sample jars into the balloon, wrapping each one in cotton
and then placing them into the case.
JAMES GLAISHER
One must make compromises in order
to achieve greatness my friend....
He hears a ROAR from the crowds, he turns towards it, as does
JAMES.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
And he’s merely one compromise.

Fast approaching, standing on top of a carriage drawn by 4
horses - getting cheers from all sides - AMELIA is now
resplendent in a dress festooned with feathers. It’s a
complete transformation from the woman we saw earlier, the
woman almost cowed by the world is now wild and fabulous. She
has the crowd in the palm of her hand and has a look of utter
delight on her face.
As the carriage pulls alongside the balloon, one of the men
holding the ropes passes one to her. She SWINGS from it onto
the rostrum. She does a cartwheel on landing, and turns that
cartwheel into a flip. She lands, and presents to the crowd.
JAMES GLAISHER
You’re incredibly late.

AMELIA WREN
Lesson number one of Aeronautingwe are creatures of the skies and
have no respect for landlocked
clocks.
She walks around to the steps leading to the basket, and
speaks loud enough for everyone to hear her.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Mr. Glaisher, are you really not a
gentlemen at all? Hold out your
hand to me.
JAMES holds out his hand. She takes it. And then she tumbles
from the steps into his arms.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Naughty.
The crowd cheers.
NED pushes through the crowd to see her, AMELIA smiles at him
beguilingly.
JAMES GLAISHER
Are you ready?
AMELIA WREN
Mr Glaisher, you have no conception
of how ready I am.
NED smiles at her shyly. She gets into the basket with a
flourish, and then waves to the crowds. She whistles 5A

- and jumping from the carriage window comes a dog in a small
coat. She holds out her hands, he jumps into her arms.
JAMES GLAISHER
No. Absolutely not. Under no
circumstances are we taking a dog.
AMELIA WREN
I told you we’d need to put on a
show for takeoff, and the crowd
prefers my dog to your boxes.
She indicates the scientific instruments being loaded into
the balloon.
JAMES GLAISHER
These are essential meteorological
instruments.

AMELIA makes eyes at one of the men holding the balloon down,
they nod at her authoritatively, she nods back.
AMELIA WREN
And this is an essential dog. She’s
called Posey. The essential Posey.
She puts Posey down, and he enters the basket through a
little opening in the side.
The crowd cheer. JAMES grimaces.
She pulls herself from his arms onto the edge of the balloon.
She balances along the edge, all nimble beautiful energy. She
raises her hands in the air. The crowd whoop. She is
astonishing. She raises her hands again for silence.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Ladies and Gentlemen. Today myself Amelia Wren - my naughty scientist
Mr. Glaisher - and my wonder dog
Posey - are going to change the
world. Are you ready for us to do
so?
There are loud cheers.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
This balloon on which I stand - the
Mammoth - is a balloon like no
other and will allow us to ascend
higher into the air than any man or
woman has ever gone.
She raises her hands in the air. The crowd laugh and cheer
again. She looks out in the crowd and sees a man she
recognises: PIERRE. She looks at him a moment and then
controls herself.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
The French rose to 23,000 feet.
Today, we will break their record
and reclaim it for these fair
shores. Who knows, we may reach the
moon and bring back star dust!
(beat)
Today is a day when history will be
made - and you will all be part of
it.
(to Glaisher)
Mr Glaisher, now’s your moment. Up
you get.
There are yet more cheers. AMELIA pulls JAMES upwards, so he
too balances on the basket. AMELIA raises both her hands into
the air. On cue, FIREWORKS go off around the park.

JAMES looks around at them all - a bemused smile on his face whilst AMELIA quickly and efficiently checks the rigging and
valves surrounding the basket.
Fireworks?

JAMES GLAISHER

AMELIA WREN
Are you ready?
JAMES GLAISHER
I just need to retake my ground
readings and then a final check of
the equipment....
She counts the sand bags, she checks the appendix and finally
she checks the valve line. She’s fast, precise and
magnificently efficient.
AMELIA WREN
Well, my equipment was all prepared
in advance. Now, don’t touch that
rope, Mr Glaisher - it’ll let out
the gas.
JAMES GLAISHER
I do know how a balloon works.
She signals to the men on the ground - who let go of the
ropes and kick out the stakes.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
We fly.

AMELIA WREN

JAMES GLAISHER
Ground readings are essential - if
they’re not accurate, then
everything I take from now on The balloon rises up. JAMES looks around, slightly
bewildered, he starts desperately to take temperature and
pressure readings.
AMELIA WREN
The sky awaits.
AMELIA takes a handful of sand and deposits it off the side
of the balloon which falls to the floor beneath.

There’s a moment of stasis and then - with a jerk and a creak
or two - the balloon begins to rise up. Slowly at first, but
with gathering speed. It’s majestic.
JOHN TREW
God speed, old man.
JOHN TREW calls up to the basket. But JAMES GLAISHER doesn’t
even notice him, he’s too intent on getting his notations
down.
The crowd watch in wonderment as the Mammoth silently
ascends. Amongst them we pick out the face of CHARLIE.

AMELIA has a business-like air that we haven’t seen before.
She pulls herself up onto the netting on the side of the
balloon.
JAMES GLAISHER
What are you doing?
AMELIA WREN
Giving the people their money’s
worth.
She leans out and waves, the crowd cheer. The balloon rises
to sixty feet and then a hundred. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE watch
from below, all with their faces turned upward to the sky.
She climbs further up the side of the balloon.
JAMES GLAISHER
Won’t you damage the integrity of
the balloon?
Perhaps.

AMELIA WREN

She pulls a cord on the side of her dress and the feathers
fall from it from all sides leaving her half the size.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
I LOVE YOU ALL.
JAMES GLAISHER
This is insane.
The feathers twinkle down in the wind, and are gathered
enthusiastically by the crowd below.
She leans out further, keeping good hold of the netting as
she does, but she leans too far, she loses her grip, and she
suddenly SLIPS -

She SCREAMS - and then spins athletically around the hoop and
smiles. The crowd cheer below.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
For God’s sake.
AMELIA WREN
It’s what they call entertainment,
Mr Glaisher.
JAMES GLAISHER
Well, I’m not finding it
particularly entertaining.
AMELIA WREN
Yes, it requires a sense of humour.
Which you seem to..lack.
She hangs nonchalantly in the air, her arms outstretched,
welcoming the applause, her smile wider still.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Oh, don’t look so sour. The dog.
Give me the dog.
JAMES GLAISHER
What do you mean give you the dog?
AMELIA WREN
Pass me Posey, Mr. Glaisher.
JAMES GLAISHER
I’m not handing you the dog.
JAMES wrestles with this notion.
AMELIA WREN
Posey, now. Before we lose them.
He scrabbles around in the basket for the dog.
Eventually he’s able to grab POSEY and passes the dog up to
her. But as he does, she lets POSEY slip from her grasp.
She screams and he hollers out in astonishment - as the dog
plummets past him, falling towards the earth with a yelp, she
looks down after it - anguished - and then the dog’s
parachute opens.
A parachute?
The crowd cheer ever louder. She smiles.

She spins round on the hoop and kisses the air extravagantly.
JAMES looks at her - unsure what has happened here, but sure
he doesn’t like it.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Oh, well done Posey! Well done.
She watches as POSEY is caught in NED’s arms below and then
breathes in a tremendous breath, she is high on exhilaration.
She sees JAMES looking up at her.

AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Mr Glaisher, you are airborne for
the first time in your life, I
suggest you spend less time
frowning at me and more taking in
the world we’ve just left.

out below.

AMELIA WREN

Quite something isn’t she? London.
When we’re further up, we’ll be
able to see across to Windsor and
down to Brighton. With current
bearing, we should end up somewhere
south of Canterbury. But anything
is possible in this weather.
JAMES says nothing. AMELIA looks at him a moment more and
then is a hive of energy balancing their equipment. From
entertainer to businesswoman in two short breaths.
JAMES GLAISHER
It all looks so AMELIA WREN
Insignificant?
With one final look down, she pulls herself down to the
basket, flashes him a smile and then turns back to her
equipment.

AMELIA pulls her sleeves down and starts to take her make-up
off.
JAMES GLAISHER
I have spent much of my life being
laughed at for what I do Miss Wren,
I did hope today of all days might
prove an exception.
He returns to his books. She watches him carefully.
AMELIA WREN
Tell me, what determines your
reputation?
JAMES GLAISHER
My reputation?
AMELIA WREN
Your standing in the scientific
community?
JAMES frowns, considering sincerely.
JAMES GLAISHER
I am aware what reputation means.
The papers I’ve written, the
discoveries I’ve uncovered.
AMELIA WREN
Your reputation is built on paper.
My reputation is built on screams.
Those people below came to be
entertained. And they - if you
didn’t know - are the ones paying
for this trip.
JAMES looks at her, then shakes his head, as he takes a pair
of opera-glasses out of a pocket in the side of the basket.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
Off to the opera?
He ignores her and uses the glasses to look up at the sky the darkening clouds - he frowns, but then dismisses his
worry.

JOHN TREW
You are aware he might not get off

It could be anything. The gas valve
ruptured, the silk tore JAMES smiles as suddenly - clear as a day across London, a

And there are no advantages in

JAMES thinks and then looks at her. He looks back at his

JAMES GLAISHER
The air pressure is - changing

There is a flash of LIGHTNING - AMELIA turns towards it as
JAMES scans the sky - truly concerned now.
AMELIA WREN
Your readings were wrong. We are

JAMES GLAISHER

He holds out a hand. He’s listening for something else. We
wait with him - the silence is powerful and oppressive.
AMELIA looks at her hands. Moisture is clinging to her
gloves. There is another rumble of THUNDER.
AMELIA WREN
You’re discerning how close we are
to the storm.
JAMES says nothing - clearly panicked, he turns to his
equipment and consults numbers in his book. Suddenly the
balloon JOLTS. The balloonists grab the side of the basket.
Then there is calm again. AMELIA looks to the West and the

Suddenly both balloonists are THROWN to the floor, an
agitation in the air causes a WHIRLWIND - which turns the
giant balloon three times from the right to the left.
There is another SMASH OF LIGHTNING closer to the balloon
this time, and with it comes the RAIN.
Rain which lashes down and which seems to suggest worse.
JAMES returns to his instrumentation, writing down a series
of readings.
AMELIA WREN

The equipment will give us the

They are THROWN again, violently this time, horrifically this

AMELIA hauls him to the floor and uses her legs to pincer him
into position AMELIA WREN
Stay still and keep calm - I need
to get us out of here.
And then they are THROWN again - and this time JAMES is
thrown on top of AMELIA, smashing his head on the pigeon box
in the process. BLOOD pours from the wound.

JAMES GLAISHER

AMELIA WREN
There are two ways to break a
storm. One is to travel beneath it,
the other - to travel above it. The
safest way is up.
Another fork of LIGHTNING STRIKES.
The THUNDER ROARS immediately afterwards.
AMELIA looks across at JAMES - a smile spreads across his
face.
JAMES GLAISHER
The safest way is up?
AMELIA WREN
Who did you think you got in a
balloon with?
AMELIA smiles and then pulls off her wet and slippy gloves
and grabs a knife from her small bag and leans over the side
of the balloon - seemingly immune to the raging storm - to
slice off some bags of ballast.

Then the balloonists hit a pocket of cold air and the balloon
suddenly DROPS 1000 FEET.
This has the effect of sending AMELIA and JAMES and
everything that isn’t bound to the basket of the balloon up
in the air. JAMES’s leg hits the underside of the table on
his way up, BREAKING IT and sending his equipment everywhere.
We watch almost in slow motion the detritus float away - her
gloves arcing gracefully out of the balloon and away.
AMELIA and JAMES hit the underside of the balloon, bounce
off, and fall back towards the basket again.
JAMES lands HARD in the basket, but AMELIA misses the basket,
clawing desperately at the wicker as she does. JAMES looks
for her but everything is obscured by the mist. He’s blind.
JAMES GLAISHER
Amelia! Amelia.
AMELIA’s legs dangle helplessly in space. She clings to the
rope that holds the grapnel, the rain LASHING around her.

The mist clears and her perilous position becomes very clear.
She’s on the verge of oblivion. Then the mist returns and the
blindness is intoxicating.
JAMES grabs a central rope and reaches out a hand JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
Take my hand. Take my hand.
He grabs at one of the toggled ropes holding the basket to
the hoop, but in quick succession three of the TOGGLES SNAP
and the balloon is massively destabilized, everything tumbles
towards him as the basket falls into a slant. This loosens
AMELIA’s grip and she falls further. Screaming as she does.
AMELIA WREN
I can’t - I can’t get...
JAMES GLAISHER
Hold on. HOLD ON.
He grabs another rope, then quickly ties a rope around his
waist and secures the other end to the hoop above his head.
He steels himself - overcomes his fear - and leans out.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
On three. One. Two.
They grab hands.
They dangle for a moment, him holding her as firmly as he
can.
And then he starts heaving her back into the balloon. She
scrabbles up, gets a foothold. It’s hard.
The rain continues to lash their faces. AMELIA manoeuvres her

As the storm buffets around them, AMELIA pulls a ROPE next to
JAMES, releasing a sandbag which plummets into the cloud.
She pulls another ROPE on her side of the basket: another bag
of ballast FALLS.

They look at each other, clinging on for dear life, as the
storm rages around them.
There’s a particularly large JOLT and then there’s silence.
They both breathe out. The grey mist surrounding them begins
to brighten as we start to get wispy definition in the
clouds.
Then, almost magically, sunlight pours into the basket. They
both smile as a golden-tinged blue starts to emerge.
A calmness floods both over them and the balloon.
AMELIA unties the rope, and they both lie there a little
more. Then JAMES stumbles to his feet and looks out.

looks down at the storm, and then up at the tranquil air.
JAMES GLAISHER
We rose above it.
AMELIA gets to her feet slowly, she looks around herself. She
looks at the dripping wet balloon, ropes and at the wet prone

And we’re back in the balloon and looking down, a magnificent
sea of cloud lies beneath it, its surface being varied with
endless hills, hillocks, mountain chains and many snow white
masses rising from it. Towering pillars of Cumulonimbus rise
upwards to the heavens all around them. The balloon is
dwarfed by the enormity of the cloudscape.
The thunder, now far below them, rumbles beneath the car.
JAMES and the equipment are now on the other side of the
basket, trying to rebalance and re-angle the basket. AMELIA
is above him, perilously balancing on the edge of the
balloon, lashing a rope from the basket to the hoop in order
to re-engineer the broken toggle.

And reflected in the centre of it, the Mammoth.

Then we hear whispers of voices that transfigure into workmen
calling to each other.
As if by magic, we are surrounded by the crystal clear sounds
of a London street. It’s as if we’re right there.

ANTONIA
I hated you going in the air with

With Mr Glaisher.
ANTONIA
You are my only sister, I do not
wish to lose you to any more

AMELIA WREN
You’d rather I found a man prepared
to marry me, to devote myself to.
ANTONIA
I’d rather you’d find a way to make
yourself happy rather than the
pursuit of frivolous history
making. You can’t just fly away
from your problems! You have to
face them here - on earth - with

AMELIA pushes their way into a corner where reams of material
lie ready for stitching.

We rejoin the aeronauts as they soar higher. They are sitting
together on the floor of the balloon. JAMES has assembled his
instruments on top of the campaign chest, and is using the
top of his ruined table to write on.
The clouds roll in their glittering masses beneath them and
the balloon throws a large shadow on this heap of clouds.
JAMES’s suit is wet through and he is cold - the only thing
preventing hypothermia is the fierce sun - which is keeping
him moderately heated (and causing his clothes to steam).

There’s a silence. JAMES is unsure how to break the silence.

AMELIA takes a swab from a pocket in the side of the basket.
AMELIA WREN
Ashamed as I am to not stick to

Does your forehead not hurt?
JAMES GLAISHER

past them and lands on a piece of JAMES’ equipment. They both
look at it in surprise.
AMELIA WREN
At this height?
JAMES GLAISHER
That’s exactly what I was thinking.
Then another YELLOW BUTTERFLY floats past. Soon they are

and then another on AMELIA’s arm.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
Of all the amazing things My friend John Trew - he’s made
study of them. He theorised beyond the birds - an air current
on which only the insects travel...
I never believed him and I
certainly didn’t think we’d prove
him right.
The butterfly on his head flies away. He smiles reaches out a
hand and gently lifts the butterfly from her arm. This feels
like a new intimacy. We lean into that moment and then they
both flick it away.
AMELIA WREN
They are wonderful.
JAMES GLAISHER
Where are they heading, do you

He smiles at her, she smiles back, and then her expression
changes.
She reaches out her hand and places it within the
butterflies.

They dance around her and away. She turns and watch them go.
Then she turns back to JAMES, with tears in her eyes.
AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)

sits amongst the stars rising up and up and up.
AMELIA is shivering, she looks across at JAMES who is
desperately trying to conceal how cold he is.
He takes a series of readings. But every step he takes, every
inch he moves, costs him dearly and he is really struggling
to lift his head.
AMELIA looks up at the balloon, it looks like it’s bursting
at the seams.
She moves alongside him to help with his instrumentation.

There is still ice.
JAMES GLAISHER
And the temperatures unprecedented - freezing ranges
that nobody has ever predicted.
JAMES tries to write down the readings but has difficulty
controlling his hands.
He looks at his hands - exasperated and then tries again.
He looks up at the instruments. He blinks so as to see them.
He tries to write something a third time, but it’s a scrawl
that’s barely decipherable.
He attaches it to a pigeon’s leg. A pigeon that seems barely
alive. He throws it out of the balloon - it drops like a
stone.
JAMES GLAISHER (CONT’D)
No concern necessary. We have
another.
He opens the final door in the pigeon box. It’s got a Pigeon
lying prone at the bottom of it.

AMELIA immediately tries to stop him, dragging him down into

surprisingly strong and agile.
The two twist over in the bottom of the basket.
It’s an ugly fight, desperate and full of passion. These two
are inexperienced (and not particularly accomplished)
fighters and the altitude is sapping their strength.
But eventually JAMES manages to pin AMELIA down.
AMELIA WREN
You gave me your word. It is time
to descend.
JAMES GLAISHER
I will not stop - because you can’t
withstand a little pressure.
AMELIA WREN
Can’t you see what’s happening we’re going to die unless we
descend now.
JAMES looks at her, and then he feels his nose start to
bleed, a drop of blood falls onto her cheek, he touches his
nose and looks at his blood. He blinks.
He rolls over, freeing her. She stays beside him. Both are
exhausted by their efforts.

Her foot slips and she nearly falls backwards into the

She looks down at the horrors of emptiness below.
She takes a breath. She controls herself. She takes another

Now standing on top of the hoop, Wren reaches up into the
rigging - but she cannot get her hands to grip - she looks at
her hands - they’re white and beginning to blacken frostbite has set in.
She stares at her hands in disbelief.

She hooks her hands over the rigging, uses her wrists as
leverage and begins to climb up the side of the balloon.

The rigging keeps her protected until she reaches the equator

She hesitates a moment...and then...
She swings out so she can continue climbing up the outside of
the balloon. Nothing is protecting her now.
It’s arduous.
It’s terrifying.
It’s undoubtedly perilous.
But she’s dogged. She’s merciless with herself. Every piece
of pain she ignores. She tries to grab a nearby tether rope,
to tie herself to the balloon, but it’s just out of reach.
She stretches for it.
She loses her grip, and her hands fall backwards - she
screams out in fear and pain but stays hooked on the rigging

She is literally on top of the world.
A tiny figure on top of a Mammoth which sits against a vast

She looks around herself, admiring it all.
And then she brings her foot down hard upon the vent.
She smashes down again and again.
And the ice cracks.
From all sides gas billows out.
AMELIA almost disappears within it.
We close on her face, she’s oxygen deprived and now breathing
in coal gas but she has something left.
Or does she?
She sways, she looks down at the vent, she realises it needs

She takes a knife from her belt. She bends down, coughing

She pulls her foot clear. Her boot remains lodged in the

She stands a moment more.
And then collapses. For a while, she lies on top of the
balloon as it gradually slows its ascent, and begins to
descend. And then, gradually at first, her body begins to
slide off the top of the balloon. She wakes up just as it’s

She closes her eyes again.
And then she opens them again.
She looks around.

*

AMELIA WREN
James? James?
No answer.

*
JAMES!

AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)

She stops and listens. And then, faintly, in the distance:
Amelia!

JAMES GLAISHER

She laughs. They’ve made it. Then she struggles to her feet,
and hobbles towards James. He’s crawling on his hands and
knees, clearly in pain.
James.

JAMES GLAISHER
I was just coming to find you.
AMELIA WREN
Not very quickly, it seems.
Can you stand?

*
*

JAMES GLAISHER
I’d rather not.
AMELIA WREN
And if I help you....
JAMES GLAISHER
Then I will stand.
She smiles and helps him up. They look around for a moment,
and then - slowly - begin to walk across the field.

AMELIA (V.O.)
It was estimated that we rose to a
height of 37,000 feet that day - 5
miles high.

ARTHUR GLAISHER lies in bed, while ETHEL reads from a copy of
The Times.
ETHEL GLAISHER
“Two aeronauts have been nearer, by
some miles, to the moon and stars
than all the race of man before
them...”
Our boy.

JAMES is delivering a report on his record breaking balloon
ascent. JOHN TREW looks on proudly.
AMELIA (V.O.)
James Glaisher’s meticulous
recording of data led to the
discovery that the atmosphere has
different layers within it that
govern our weather.

JAMES GLAISHER
The fact that we were able to come
back at all to present this is due
to some luck and Amelia Wren’s
courageous flying. And so, we tell
our story not for the purposes of
pleasure, but for the advancement
of knowledge and the good of us
all. Thank you.

The members of the Royal Society begin to rise and start to
clap, until the whole room is full with the sound of
applause.
AMELIA (V.O.)
He was elected head of the
Meteorological Society 5 years
later.

CHARLES GREEN is still sat as the people around him applaud.
He reluctantly gets to his feet and, aware of the people
around him, puts his hands together forces a smile.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

AMELIA is with ANTONIA and ANTONIA’S DAUGHTERS, running up a
wet and windy hillside. The girls are carrying kites. Despite
the weather, everyone’s laughing.

*
*
*

AMELIA (V.O.)
My own discovery was more personal I found my way back into the world
again.

*
*
*

AMELIA WREN
Come on! I’ve flown in worse
weather than this. We’ll make
pilots of you yet.

*
*
*

We won’t!!

ANTONIA

AMELIA (V.O.)
We took to the skies in the name of
discovery, to find something new.
To change the world. But you don’t
change the world simply by looking
at it. You change it by living in
it.

In the basket, JAMES silently takes his measurements and
AMELIA pilots the balloon. JAMES looks up for a moment to
take in the beauty that surrounds him. He makes eye contact
with AMELIA. She holds his look.

We cut wide to see the balloon sailing up and away,
silhouetted against the setting sun.

Look up. The sky lies open.
