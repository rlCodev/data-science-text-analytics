BLACK SCREEN
TITLE: AUGUST WILSON’S FENCES

The screen remains black. The sound of
a truck rumbling along a street. Two
men are heard talking:
bono
troy

(v.o.): Troy, you ought to stop that lying!
(v.o.): I ain’t lying! The nigger had a watermelon this big. Talking about . . . ​
“What watermelon, Mr. Rand?” I like to fell out! “What
watermelon, Mr. Rand?” . . . ​
And it sitting there
big as life.

bono

(v.o.): What did Mr. Rand say?

troy

(v.o.): Ain’t said nothing. Figure if the nigger
too dumb to know he carrying a watermelon, he
wasn’t gonna get much sense out of him. Trying to
hide that great big old watermelon under his
coat. Afraid to let the white man see him carry
it home.

EXT. WYLIE AVENUE, THE HILL, PITTSBURGH—­​
EARLY SEPTEMBER—­​MORNING
The rear of the garbage truck, god’s
point of view: Troy Maxson and Jim
Bono hang on to either side of the
truck as it heads toward its next
collection point.
Troy is fifty-­
three years old, a large
man with thick, heavy hands; it is
this largeness that he strives to fill
out and make an accommodation with.
Together with his blackness, his
largeness informs his sensibilities
and the choices he has made in his
life.
Of the two men, Bono is obviously the
follower. His commitment to their
friendship of thirty odd years is
rooted in his admiration of Troy’s
honesty, capacity for hard work, and
his strength, which Bono seeks to
emulate.
bono:

I’m like you . . . ​
I ain’t got no time for them

kind of people.
troy:

Now what he look like getting mad ’cause he see

the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?
bono:

He come talking to me about . . . ​
“Troy Maxson

gonna get us fired.” I told him to get away from

me with that. He walked away from me calling you
a troublemaker. (anxious) What Mr. Rand say?
troy:

Ain’t said nothing. He told me to go down to the

commissioner’s office next Friday. They called me
down there to see them.

The truck halts. Troy gets down and
heads for heavy garbage cans at the
curb; Bono uses Troy’s shoulder to
ease himself down.
bono:

Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,

they can’t fire you. That’s what one of them white
fellows tell me.
troy:

I ain’t worried about them firing me. They gonna

fire me ’cause I asked a question? That’s all I
did. I went to Mr. Rand and asked him—­​
“Why? Why
you got the white mens driving and the colored
lifting?” Told him, “What’s the matter, don’t I
count?”

TITLE: THE HILL, PITTSBURGH
TITLE: 1957
troy:

You think only white fellows got sense enough

to drive a truck? That ain’t no paper job. Hell,
anybody can drive a truck. How come you got all
the whites driving and the coloreds lifting?

The truck’s white driver watches the
collectors in his side mirror.

He told me, “Take it to the union.” Well, hell,

that’s what I done! Now they wanna come up with
this pack of lies.
bono:

I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any

questions . . . ​
just tell the truth! It ain’t
nothing but something they done trumped up on you
’cause you filed a complaint on them.

Bono returns the last empty can. Troy
climbs up on the truck.
troy:

Brownie don’t understand nothing. All I want

them to do is change the job description. Give
everybody a chance to drive the truck. Brownie
can’t see that. He ain’t got that much sense.

Bono in place, Troy slaps the truck.
As it starts moving, Troy pulls a
lever and the compactor crushes the
trash.

EXT. SANITATION YARD—­​AFTERNOON
Men stream out of the yard, Troy and
Bono among them.
How you figure he be making out with that gal be
up at Taylors’ all the time . . . ​
that Alberta
gal?
troy:

Who?

bono:

Which is to say nothing.
bono:

It is, huh? I figure you doing a little better

than me . . . ​
and I ain’t saying what I’m doing.
troy:

Aw, nigger, look here . . . ​
I know you. If you

had got anywhere near that gal, twenty minutes
later you be looking to tell somebody. And the
first one you gonna tell . . . ​
that you gonna want
to brag to . . . ​
is gonna be me.
bono:

I ain’t saying that. I see where you be eyeing

her.
troy:

I eye all the women. I don’t miss nothing. Don’t

never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson don’t eye
the women.
bono:

You been doing more than eyeing her. You done

bought her a drink or two.
troy:

Hell yeah, I bought her a drink! What that mean?

I bought you one, too. What that mean ’cause I buy
her a drink? I’m just being polite.
bono:

It’s all right to buy her one drink. That’s what

you call being polite. But when you wanna be buying two or three . . . ​
that’s what you call eyeing her.
troy:

Look here, as long as you known me . . . ​
you

ever known me to chase after women?
bono:

Hell yeah! Long as I done known you. You for-

getting I knew you when.

Naw, I’m talking about since I been married to

Rose?
bono:

Oh, not since you been married to Rose. Now,

that’s the truth, there. I can say that.
troy:

All right then! Case closed.

EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT—­​TROY AND ROSE’S
STREET—­​AFTERNOON
Troy and Bono make their way down the
street to a narrow house. A pair of
lawn chairs sit on the small front
porch. They take the short cut through
the side alley into the back yard. It
is Friday, payday, and the one night
of the week the two men engage in a
ritual of talk and drink.
bono:

I see you be walking up around Alberta’s house.

You supposed to be at Taylors’ and you be walking
up around there.
troy:

What you watching where I’m walking for? I ain’t

watching after you.
bono:

I seen you walking around there more than once.

troy:

Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere!

That don’t mean nothing because you seen me walking around there.
bono:

showed up one day.

troy:

Tallahassee. You can look at her and tell she one

of them Florida gals. They got some big healthy
women down there. Grow them right up out the ground.
Got a little bit of Indian in her. Most of them
niggers down in Florida got some Indian in them.
bono:

I don’t know about that Indian part. But she

damn sure big and healthy. Woman wears some big
stockings. Got them great big old legs and hips
as wide as the Mississippi river.
troy:

Legs don’t mean nothing. You don’t do nothing

but push them out of the way. But them hips cushion the ride!
bono:

Troy, you ain’t got no sense.

troy:

It’s the truth! Like you riding on Goodyears!

Troy cracks the seal of the bottle of
gin, pours some out on the ground . . . ​
for the folks that are long gone.

EXT. TROY’S AND ROSE’S BACKYARD—­​
AFTERNOON
In the center of the yard, a large
tree, two chairs beneath it. A
battered baseball hangs from a rope
tied to a tree limb; a big weathered
bat leans against the trunk.
The yard is bordered on either side by
fences and houses. At the rear,

there’s a derelict wooden house with
boarded windows. The remnants of a
fence are strewn between the wild lot
behind the abandoned house and the
Maxsons’ yard.
Materials for a new fence . . . ​
a
couple of wooden sawhorses waiting for
the lumber stacked under a tarp. One
or two chairs of dubious value sit at
one end where the kitchen window opens
onto the porch. An old-­
fashioned ice
box stands silent guard at the other
end.
Rose maxson comes out onto the porch,
holding a bowl of snap peas. She is
ten years younger than troy. Her
devotion to him stems from the
recognition of the possibilities of
her life without him: a succession of
abusive men and their babies, a life
of partying and running the streets,
the church, or aloneness with its
attendant pain and frustration. She
recognizes troy’s spirit as a fine and
illuminating one and she either
ignores or forgives his faults, only
some of which she recognizes. Though
she doesn’t drink, her presence is an
integral part of the friday night
rituals.

bono:

No, I thank you, Rose. But Lucille say she cook-

ing up a pot of pigfeet.
troy:

Pigfeet! Hell, I’m going home with you! Might

even stay the night if you got some pigfeet. You
got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?
rose:

I’m cooking up some chicken. I got some chicken

and collard greens.
troy:

Well, go on back in the house and let me and

Bono finish what we was talking about. This is men
talk. I got some talk for you later. You know what
kind of talk I mean. Go on and powder it up.

Troy Maxson, don’t you start that now!

Look here, Bono . . . ​
When I met this woman . . . ​
I got out that place, say, “Hitch up my pony,
saddle up my mare . . . ​
there’s a woman out there
for me somewhere. I looked here. Looked there.
Saw Rose and latched on to her.” I latched on to
her and told her—­​
I’m gonna tell you the truth—­​

wanna be your man.” Rose told me . . . ​

I told him if he wasn’t the marrying kind, then

move out the way so the marrying kind could find me.
troy:

That’s what she told me. “Nigger, you in my way.

You blocking the view! Move out the way so I can
find me a husband.” I thought it over two or three
days. Come back—­​
rose:

Ain’t no two or three days nothing. You was back

the same night.
troy:

Come back, told her . . . ​
“Okay, baby . . . ​
but

I’m gonna buy me a banty rooster and put him out
there in the backyard . . . ​
and when he see a
stranger come, he’ll flap his wings and crow . . .”
Look here, Bono, I could watch the front door by
myself . . . ​
it was that back door I was worried
about.
rose:

Troy, you ought not talk like that. Troy ain’t

doing nothing but telling a lie.

Only

thing

is . . . ​
when

we

forget the rooster . . . ​
we ain’t had
no yard!
bono:

I hear you tell it. Me and Lucille was staying

down there on Logan Street. Had two rooms with the
outhouse in the back. I ain’t mind the outhouse
none. But when that goddamn wind blow through
there in the winter . . . ​
that’s what I’m talking
about! To this day I wonder why in the hell I ever
stayed down there for six long years. But see, I
didn’t know I could do no better. I thought only
white folks had inside toilets and things.

There’s a lot of people don’t know they can do

no better than they doing now. That’s just something you got to learn. A lot of folks still shop
at Bella’s.
troy:

Ain’t nothing wrong with shopping at Bella’s.

She got fresh food.
rose:

I ain’t said nothing about if she got fresh

food. I’m talking about what she charge. She
charge ten cents more than the A&P.
troy:

The A&P ain’t never done nothing for me. I

spends my money where I’m treated right. I go
down to Bella, say, “I need a loaf of bread, I’ll
pay you Friday.” She give it to me. What sense
that make when I got money to go and spend it
somewhere else and ignore the person who done
right by me? That ain’t in the Bible.
rose:

We ain’t talking about what’s in the Bible. What

sense it make to shop there when she overcharge?
troy:

You shop where you want to. I’ll do my shopping

where the people been good to me.
rose:

Well, I don’t think it’s right for her to over-

charge. That’s all I was saying.

Look here . . . ​

raising all kind of hell.

Troy hands him the bottle.
troy:

The only thing I say about the A&P is I’m glad

Cory got that job down there. Help him take care
of his school clothes and things.

Rose straightens up. Cory is a sore
subject.
troy:

Gabe done moved out and things getting tight

around here. He got that job . . . ​
he can start
to look out for himself.
rose:

Cory done went and got recruited by a college

football team.
troy:

I told that boy about that football stuff. The

white man ain’t gonna let him get nowhere with
that football. I told him when he first come to me
with it. Now you come telling me he done went and
got more tied up in it. He ought to go and get
recruited in how to fix cars or something where he
can make a living.
rose:

He ain’t talking about making no living playing

football. It’s just something the boys in school
do. They gonna send a recruiter by to talk to you.
He’ll tell you he ain’t talking about making no
living playing football. It’s a honor to be recruited.

It ain’t gonna get him nowhere. Bono’ll tell you

that.

Gibson. Them’s the only two men ever hit more
home runs than you.

What it ever get me? Ain’t got a pot to piss in

or a window to throw it out of.
rose:

Times have changed since you was playing base-

ball, Troy. That was before the war. Times have
changed a lot since then.
troy:

How in hell they done changed?

rose:

They got lots of colored boys playing ball now.

Baseball and football.

You right about that, Rose. Times have changed,

Troy. You just come along too early.
troy:

There ought not never have been no time called

too early! Now you take that fellow . . . ​
what’s
that fellow they had playing right field for the
Yankees back then? You know who I’m talking about,
Bono. Used to play right field for the Yankees.
rose:

Selkirk?

troy:

Selkirk! That’s it! Man batting .269, under-

stand? .269. What kind of sense that make? I was
hitting .432 with thirty-­
seven home runs! Man
batting .269 and playing right field for the Yankees! I saw Josh Gibson’s daughter yesterday. She
walking around with raggedy shoes on her feet.
Now I bet you Selkirk’s daughter ain’t walking
around with raggedy shoes on her feet! I bet you

What

you

talking about Jackie Robinson. Jackie Robinson
wasn’t nobody. I’m talking about if you could
play ball then they ought to have let you play.
Don’t care what color you were. Come telling me I
come along too early. If you could play . . . ​
then they ought to have let you play.

Troy takes a long drink.
rose:

You gonna drink yourself to death. You don’t

need to be drinking like that.
troy:

Death ain’t nothing. I done seen him. Done

wrassled with him. You can’t tell me nothing
about death. Death ain’t nothing but a fastball
on the outside corner. And you know what I’ll do
to that! Lookee here, Bono . . . ​
am I lying?

Handing Bono the bottle, Troy picks up
the bat and takes a gentle whack at
the tethered ball. He assumes a
batter’s stance.
troy:

You get one of them fastballs, about waist high,

over the outside corner of the plate where you
can get the meat of the bat on it . . .

Naw, you telling the truth there. I seen you do

it.

I don’t know why you want to get on talking

about death.

Ain’t nothing wrong with talking about death.

That’s part of life. Everybody gonna die. You
gonna die, I’m gonna die. Bono’s gonna die. Hell,
we all gonna die.
rose:

But you ain’t got to talk about it. I don’t like

to talk about it.

You the one brought it up. Me and Bono was

talking

about

baseball . . . ​
you

tell

me

I’m

gonna drink myself to death. Ain’t that right,
Bono? You know I don’t drink this but one night
out of the week. That’s Friday night. I’m gonna
drink just enough to where I can handle it. Then
I cuts it loose. I leave it alone. So don’t you
worry about me drinking myself to death. ’Cause I
ain’t worried about Death. I done seen him. I
done wrestled with him.

Look here, Bono . . . ​
I looked up one day and

Death was marching straight at me. Like Soldiers
on Parade! The Army of Death was marching straight
at me. The middle of July, 1941. It got real cold
just like it be winter. It seem like Death himself reached out and touched me on the shoulder.
He touch me just like I touch you. I got cold as
ice and Death standing there grinning at me.
rose:

Troy, why don’t you hush that talk.

troy:

I say . . . ​
“What you want, Mr. Death? You be

wanting me? You done brought your army to be getting me?” I looked him dead in the eye. I wasn’t
fearing nothing. I was ready to tangle. Just like
I’m ready to tangle now. The bible say be ever
vigilant. That’s why I don’t get but so drunk. I
got to keep watch.

(to bono): Troy was right down there in Mercy Hospital.

You

remember

he

had

pneumonia?

Laying

there with a fever talking plumb out of his head.
troy: Death standing there staring at me

. . . ​
carrying

that sickle in his hand. Finally he say, “You want
bound

over

for

another

year?”

See,

just

like

that . . . ​
“You want bound over for another year?”
I told him, “Bound over hell! Let’s settle this
now!” It seem like he kinda fell back when I said
that, and all the cold went out of me. I reached
down and grabbed that sickle and threw it just as
far as I could throw it . . . ​
and me and him commenced to wrestling. We wrestled for three days and
three nights. I can’t say where I found the strength

from. Every time it seemed like he was gonna get
the best of me, I’d reach way down deep inside myself and find the strength to do him one better.
rose:

Every time Troy tell that story he find different

ways to tell it. Different things to make up
about it.
troy:

I ain’t making up nothing. I’m telling you the

facts of what happened. I wrestled with Death for
three days and three nights and I’m standing here
to tell you about it . . . ​
All right. At the end
of the third night we done weakened each other to
where

we

can’t

hardly

move.

Death

stood

up,

throwed on his robe . . . ​
had him a white robe
with a hood on it.
Troy mimics a Klansman’s hood. Bono laughs at
this; Rose does the same in spite of herself.
troy:

He throwed on that robe and went off to look for

his sickle. Say, “I’ll be back.” Just like that.
“I’ll be back.” I told him say, “Yeah, but . . . ​
you gonna have to find me!” I wasn’t no fool. I
wasn’t going looking for him. Death ain’t nothing
to play with.

INT. FRONT ROOM—­​AFTERNOON
Lyons, 34, enters from the street,
guitar case in hand. He is troy’s son
from a previous marriage. Although he
fancies himself a musician, he is more

come out of his mouth was . . . ​
“I understand you
need some furniture and can’t get no credit.” I
liked to fell over. He say, “I’ll give you all the
credit you want, but you got to pay the interest
on it.” I told him, “Give me three rooms’ worth
and charge whatever you want.” Next day a truck
pulled up here and two men unloaded them three
rooms. Man what drove the truck give me a book.
Say send ten dollars, first of every month to the
address in the book and everything will be all
right. Say if I miss a payment the devil was coming back and it’ll be hell to pay. That was fifteen
years ago. To this day . . . ​

away.

play a nickel here and a nickel there.

laundry basket to the line and hangs
it.

numbers. Look where Pope done bought him that
restaurant off of numbers.

two dimes to rub together. He walking around with
his shoes all run over bumming money for cigarettes. All right. Got lucky there and hit the
numbers . . .

troy:

Had good sense, I’ll say that for him. He ain’t

throwed his money away.

ruined fence.

come in it! A Negro go in there and can’t get no
kind of service. I seen a white fellow come in
there and order a bowl of stew. Pope picked all
the meat out the pot for him. Man ain’t had nothing but a bowl of meat! Negro come behind him and
ain’t got nothing but the potatoes and carrots.
Talking about what numbers do for people, you
picked a wrong example. Ain’t done nothing but
make a worser fool out of him than he was before.

Rose comes out from behind the hanging
laundry.
rose:

Troy, you ought to stop worrying about what hap-

pened at work yesterday.

chanting, mocking the singer.

war ii, he has a metal plate in his
head. He carries an old trumpet tied

windows and stoops.

You know what I got, Rose. I got fruits and

vegetables.

Hear that? Hear that? That’s the hellhounds. I

You done what was right by him. Can’t nobody say
you ain’t done what was right by him. Look how
long you took care of him . . . ​
till he wanted to
have his own place and moved over there with Miss
Pearl.
troy:

That ain’t what I’m saying, woman! I’m just

stating the facts. If my brother didn’t have that
metal plate in his head . . . ​
I wouldn’t have a
pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. And
I’m fifty-­
three years old. Now see if you can understand that!

He turns and goes to the front door.
He grabs his jacket and hat. Rose is
in the kitchen doorway, holding the
mixing bowl.
rose:

Where you going off to? You been running out of

gonna work on this fence?

I’m gonna walk down to Taylors’. Listen to the

ball game. I’ll be back in a bit. I’ll work on it
when I get back.

He goes out the front door, closing it
hard. Rose looks down at the mixing
bowl, surprised that she’s holding it.
She goes to the kitchen trash can and
starts to dump the batter, but she
can’t. She sits at the table. She finds
the ball game on the radio. She gets a
metal cooking sheet, returns to the
table, wipes her hands and starts
lumping batter onto the sheet. Soon
her fingers are covered with batter.
She scrapes vigorously at her hands to
clean them, then stops, her hands
shaking. She exerts her will,
steadying them. CLOSE UP on her hands;
time passes, the light changes.

Two hours later. Rose sits, unmoving.
The lumps of dough on the sheet have

off the radio, then carries the baking
sheet to the trash can, scraping off
the ruined biscuits with a knife.
rose:

Your daddy like to had a fit with you running out

of here this morning without doing your chores.
cory:

I told you I had to go to practice.

rose:

He say you were supposed to help him with the

fence.
cory:

He been saying that the last four or five Satur-

days, and then he don’t never do nothing, but go
down to Taylors’ . . . ​
Did you tell him about the
recruiter?

He opens the refrigerator and imagines
the possibilities
rose:

Yeah, I told him.

cory:

rose:

He ain’t said nothing too much. You get up there

and get started on your chores before he gets
back. Go on and scrub down them steps before he
gets back here hollering and carrying on.

Rose tosses the baking sheet in the
sink.

silently up the front steps, grabbing
Rose from behind. Startled, she jumps!

He laughs.
rose:

What was the score of the game? Lucille had me on
the phone and I couldn’t keep up with it.

He tries to kiss her.

Attempting to kiss her again.

Playfully chasing after her.

Cory takes the saw and begins cutting
the boards. Troy continues working.
There is a long pause.
cory:

Hey, Pop . . . ​

Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra . . . ​

TV. Baseball games and everything. We could watch
the World Series.
troy:

Yeah . . . ​
And how much this TV cost?

cory:

I don’t know. They got them on sale for around

two hundred dollars.
troy:

Two hundred dollars, huh?

cory:

That ain’t that much, Pop.

it’s gonna seep inside. It’s just gonna be a little bit . . . ​
ain’t gonna hardly notice it. Then
the next thing you know, it’s gonna be leaking all
over the house. Then the wood rot from all that
water and you gonna need a whole new roof. Now,
how much you think it cost to get that roof tarred?

cory

thinking about the roof . . . ​
and whatever else
go wrong around here. Now if you had two hundred
dollars, what would you do . . . ​
fix the roof or
buy a TV?
cory:

I’d buy a TV. Then when the roof started to

leak . . . ​
when it needed fixing . . . ​
I’d fix it.

Cory hurls a finished plank aside and
grabs the next one.
troy:

Where are you gonna get the money from? You done

spent it for a TV. You gonna sit up and watch the
water run all over your brand-­
new TV.
cory:

Aw, Pop. You got money. I know you do.

Not me. I ain’t gonna owe nobody nothing if I

can help it. Miss a payment and they come and
snatch it right out your house. Then what you
got? Now, soon as I get two hundred dollars clear,
then I’ll buy a TV. Right now, as soon as I get
two hundred and sixty-­
four dollars, I’m gonna

ery day so you can get your timing. That’s what
I’m talking about.
cory:

They got some white guys on the team that don’t

play every day. You can’t play everybody at the
same time.
troy:

If they got a white fellow sitting on the

bench . . . ​
you can bet your last dollar he can’t
play! The colored guy got to be twice as good before he get on the team. That’s why I don’t want
you to get all tied up in them sports. Man on the

team and don’t use them. Same as not having them.
All them teams the same.

Hank Aaron hit two home runs today. That makes
forty-­three.

to wonder why he was living. Wonder why the devil
hadn’t come and got him. “Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin” and find out he owe him
money . . .

He should have just went on and left when he

saw he couldn’t get nowhere. That’s what I would

farm. No, he was trapped and I think he knew it.

that for?

next to Troy. He kicks it with his foot
and sends it tumbling down the hill.
troy:

See . . . ​
you swung at the ball and didn’t hit

it. That’s strike one. See, you in the batter’s box
now. You swung and you missed. That’s strike one.

Troy closes the distance, his face
leering, terrifying. Cory tries not to
flinch. Troy hisses in Cory’s ear:
troy:

Don’t you strike out!

EXT. BACKYARD—­​THE FOLLOWING
MORNING
CLOSE UP: We see a baseball swinging
like a pendulum, in and out of focus.
Cory is at the tree hitting the ball
with the bat. He tries to mimic Troy
but his swing is awkward, less sure.
Rose watches . . . ​
Cory swings again,
misses.
rose:

Cory, I want you to help me with this cupboard.

cory:

I ain’t quitting the team. I don’t care what

Poppa say.
rose:

I’ll talk to him when he gets back. He had to

go see about your Uncle Gabe. The police done arrested him. Say he was disturbing the peace.
He’ll be back directly. Come on in here and help
me clean out the top of this cupboard.

Cory goes into house. Rose sees Troy
and Bono enter the backyard from the
side yard.
rose:

Troy . . . ​
What they say down there?

troy:

Ain’t said nothing. I give them fifty dollars and

they let him go. I’ll talk to you about it.
Where’s Cory?
rose:

He’s in there helping me clean out these cup-

boards.
troy:

Tell him to get his butt out here.

Rose goes into the house. Troy and
Bono make their way over to the pile
of wood.
troy:

All they want is the money. That makes six or

seven times I done went down there and got him.
See me coming they stick out their hands.
bono:

Yeah. I know what you mean. That’s all they care

about . . . ​
that money. They don’t care about
what’s right.

(pause)
Nigger, why you got to go and get some hard
wood? You ain’t doing nothing but building a little old fence. Get you some soft pine wood. That’s
all you need.
troy:

I know what I’m doing. This is outside wood. You

put pine wood inside the house. Pine wood is inside wood. This here is outside wood. Now you
tell me where the fence is gonna be?
bono:

You don’t need this wood. You can put it up with

pine wood and it’ll stand as long as you gonna be
here looking at it.
troy:

How you know how long I’m gonna be here, nigger?

Hell, I might just live forever. Live longer than
old man Horsely.

Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

Hell, nigger, I don’t need nobody to tell me my

wife loves me. Cory . . . ​

the pick of the litter. When you picked Rose, I
was happy for you. That was the first time I knew
you had any sense. I said . . . ​

I’m gonna follow

learned how to tell where the shit lies. How to
tell it from the alfalfa. You done learned me a

He’s gone on about his business. He don’t need

Well, I don’t know. Seem like that would be the

best place for him if they did put him into the

EXT. CEMETERY
Gabe sits among the tombstones eating
a sandwich.

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE—­​
MORNING
It’s early April, and the weather’s
cool. Rose, looking tired, wears a
light jacket and scarf over her head.
She locks the front door and starts
down the steps. She stops to pull
weeds from among the daffodils she’s
growing in the planter-­
cans.

EXT. SANITATION YARD—­​LATER THAT
AFTERNOON
Men stream out of the garage, Troy
among them. He sees something that
makes him stop. Rose is across the
street, waiting for him. He crosses
the street slowly. They stand looking
at one another; Then:
rose:

Troy, I want to talk to you.

troy:

All of a sudden, after all this time, you want

to talk to me, huh? You ain’t wanted to talk to
me for months. You ain’t wanted to talk to me last

you wanna talk to me about now?

Rose looks around at the men who
glance at her and Troy as they pass
by.
rose:

Tomorrow’s Friday.

troy:

I know what day tomorrow is. You think I don’t

know tomorrow’s Friday? My whole life I ain’t
done nothing but look to see Friday coming and
you got to tell me it’s Friday.
rose:

I want to know if you’re coming home.

troy:

I always come home, Rose. You know that. There

ain’t never been a night I ain’t come home.
rose:

That ain’t what I mean . . . ​
and you know it. I

want to know if you’re coming straight home after
work.
troy:

I figure I’d cash my check . . . ​
hang out at Tay-

lors’ with the boys . . . ​

checkers . . .
rose:

Troy, I can’t live like this. I won’t live like

this. You livin’ on borrowed time with me. It’s
been going on six months now you ain’t been coming home.
troy:

I be home every night. Every night of the year.

That’s 365 days.

She went into the hospital this afternoon. Look
like she might have the baby early. I won’t be
gone long.

Troy starts to walk away.
rose

(stopping him): Well, you ought to know. They went
over to Miss Pearl’s and got Gabe today. She said
you told them to go ahead and lock him up.

He comes back.
troy:

I ain’t said no such thing. Whoever told you

that is telling a lie. Pearl ain’t doing nothing
but telling a big fat lie.

hospital and the other part to you.
troy:

I ain’t got nothing to do with that if that’s

rose: You did Gabe just like you did Cory. You wouldn’t

sign the paper for Cory . . . ​

Gabe. You signed that paper.

I told you I ain’t signed nothing, woman! The

only thing I signed was the release form. Hell, I
can’t read, I don’t know what they had on that
paper! I ain’t signed nothing about sending Gabe
away.

A few men from the garage are watching
across the street.

I said send him to the hospital . . . ​
you said

let him be free . . . ​

there and signed him to the hospital for half his
money. You went back on yourself, Troy. You gonna

Rose disappointed, walks away.
CLOSE UP on Troy, we hear a phone
ringing as we cut to . . .

INT. DAY ROOM—­​WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITAL—­​DAY
The ringing phone continues over this:
CLOSE UP on Gabe, hospital pajamas,
cleaned up, haggard, sedated. A hand
brings a spoonful of mashed carrots to
Gabe’s lips. He opens his mouth. A
ruckus in the corridor outside scares
him; he closes his mouth. Then he
looks at the person who’s holding the
spoon, and opens his mouth again. The
spoon goes in.

mashed carrots on his lap, feeding his
brother. Gabe swallows, then grins.

into:

NIGHT
Lightning flashes.
The phone’s ringing downstairs. Rose,
barely awake, switches on a small
bedside table lamp, then hurries down
to the phone. Troy opens his eyes as
he hears Rose answering it, then
silence. Troy sits up as she climbs
the stairs. Cory calls from his room:
(o.s.): Mama?

Rose murmurs to Cory, comes in the
bedroom, closes the door.

Just give me some space. That’s all.

One shoe on, the other in his hand, he
stands and turns on Rose with
controlled fury.
troy:

Just give me some room to breathe!

Rose is shocked by his demand. She
turns, closes the door, and leaves the
room. Alone, Troy realizes he’s
holding his shoe. He sits heavily on
the bed and puts it on. As he does he
starts talking to himself.
troy:

All right . . . ​
Mr. Death. See now . . . ​
I’m

gonna tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna take
and build me a fence around this yard.

He goes to the window and throws it
open. He leans out, breathing hard,
looking down into the dark yard, the
abandoned house beyond the fence. He
feels the darkness pull at him, making
him lean farther out. He tightens his
grip on the windowsill, and says to
the darkness:
troy:

See? I’m gonna build me a fence around what be-

longs to me. And then I want you to stay on the

ready for me.

Lights start to come on and windows
are being opened in the neighbors’
houses.
troy:

Then you come on. Bring your army. Bring your

sickle. Bring your wrestling clothes. I ain’t
gonna fall down on my vigilance this time. You
ain’t gonna sneak up on me no more.

A few people call: “Shut up!” “Are you
crazy?” “Stop making a racket!” etc.
troy:

when the top of your

list say Troy Maxson . . . ​
You come up and knock

to do with this.

We see the closed door behind Troy.
Then we’re on the other side of the
door, on the landing. Rose is leaning
hard against the door, hand on the
knob, wanting to go in but knowing she
mustn’t. Troy’s voice is loud even
through the door.
troy

(o.s.): This is between you and me.
Cory comes out of his room. He walks
to his mother as Troy shouts:

troy

(o.s.): Man to man. You stay on the other side of
that fence until you ready for me.

Troy waits again; no response. He
draws himself back into the room,
closes the window. He opens the
bedroom door. Rose and Cory are there.
No one knows what to say. Troy passes
his wife and son. They hear him
descending the stairs, then the front
door opens and slams shut.

AFTERNOON
In the kitchen, the radio’s on:
Opening Day for the Pirates. The
broadcast plays throughout the scene.
Rose is on her knees, weeding the
garden.
She hears the back door open and looks
toward the porch. Troy is there,
holding a small, fair-­
skinned infant in
his arms.
troy:

Rose . . . ​
I’m standing here with my daughter in

my arms. She ain’t but a wee bitty little old
thing. She don’t know nothing about grownups’ business. She innocent . . . ​
and she ain’t got no mama.
rose

(climbing the steps): What you telling me for, Troy?
She passes Troy and goes into the
kitchen. Troy stands still. The radio
blares the baseball game.
From inside, the sound of running
water, then kitchen clattering, then
the sound of a knife chopping
something, hard. The baby starts to
fret. Troy jounces her a little,
talking to her, sitting on the bottom
steps.

A man’s got to do what’s right for him. I ain’t
sorry for nothing I done. It felt right in my heart.

Troy waits for a response. The chopping
continues. The baby cries. Troy wipes
his finger on his shirt and holds a
knuckle to her mouth. She fastens on
his knuckle. Something that looks like
a smile passes across her face.
troy:

What you smiling at? Your daddy’s a big man. Got

these great big old hands. But sometimes he’s
scared. And right now your daddy’s scared ‘cause
we sitting out here and ain’t got no home. Oh, I

Over this, the sound of a truck idling.

EXT. A STREET IN A WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOOD—­​
1 MONTH LATER—­​EARLY
MORNING­
The lawns and trees along the street
are bright spring green. A garbage
truck idles as two young african-­
american collectors lift and empty
cans. Troy’s in the driver’s seat,
bored, lonely. Through his rearview
mirrors he watches the collectors
talking, laughing.
A group of white high school students
come out of one of the houses,
clowning, chatting, several boys in
varsity jackets. Troy watches them.
Then he’s startled by a loud thump from
the back: in his rearview mirror, the
collectors step on board. He shifts
into first gear and the truck rolls
through the wealthy neighborhood.

EXT. THE BACKYARD—­​AFTERNOON
Troy comes in through the side yard to
the sound of a bat hitting a baseball.
Cory, in his A&P uniform, fake bow-­
tie
dangling from his open collar, is
hitting the ball. The moment Cory sees
Troy, he stops. Troy looks ready to
say something. Cory tosses the bat
away, carelessly. Making a show of it
he buttons his collar, clips the tie
into place, and walks out the right
side alley, all without giving his
father a glance. Troy goes to the bat,
picks it up and puts it into its
proper place against the tree. He
turns and heads into the house.

INT. KITCHEN/FRONT ENTRANCE—­​
AFTERNOON
Troy comes into the kitchen, which
looks different: it’s cluttered with
baby bottles, nipples, a high chair.
Two steaming pots and one cold covered
pot are on the stove, the heat turned
off. Rose, dressed up, holds the baby
in one arm, from which a purse hangs,
stuffed with diapers and two warm
bottles. With her free hand Rose picks
up the cake.

As Rose leaves the kitchen with the
baby and the cake:

His money still in his hand, Troy
follows her to the front door, which
he opens for her.

rose:

what time I come back.
troy:

matter . . . ​

rose:

Troy, I don’t want to go into it.

She steps out onto the front porch. He
starts to follow, but she stops in the
doorway. She puts the cake down on one
of the porch chairs, turns to him:
rose:

to do is heat it up. And don’t you be eating the
rest of them cakes in there. I’m coming back for

Rose shuts the door firmly. Troy stands
there, listening to her going down the
steps.
He stands alone in the empty house, unsure of
what to do. He flaps the money he’s holding. He
goes to the dining room table and puts his cash
next to Lyons’ twenty. He pockets the twenty and
starts for the door.

INT. TAYLORS’ BAR—­​LATE AFTERNOON
Troy sits alone at the bar, a generous
glass of gin before him. He takes a
sip.

this dumb stuff. Now, why don’t you just get out
my way.

troy:

I guess you got someplace to sleep and something

to put in your belly. You got that, huh? You got
that? That’s what you need. You got that, huh?
cory:

You don’t know what I got. You ain’t got to

make me scared of you. I used to tremble every time
you called my name. Every time I heard your footsteps in the house. Wondering all the time . . . ​

Cory swings that bat at Troy a second
time. He misses. Troy continues to
advance toward him.
troy:

You’re gonna have to kill me! You wanna draw

that bat back on me. You’re gonna have to kill me.

Cory, backed up against the tree, can
go no farther. Troy taunts him. He
sticks out his head and offers him a
target.
troy:

Come on! Come on!

Cory is unable to swing the bat. Troy
grabs it.
troy:

Then I’ll show you.

Cory and Troy struggle over the bat.
The struggle is fierce and fully
engaged. Troy ultimately is the
stronger, and takes the bat from Cory
and stands over him ready to swing. He
stops himself.
troy:

Go on and get away from around my house.

Troy starts toward the tree with the
bat, staggering, sick exhausted, his
mouth horribly dry. He tries to
moisten it with this tongue: no use.
troy:

I can’t taste nothing. Hallelujah!
I can’t taste nothing no more.

He assumes a batting posture and
begins to taunt Death, the fastball in
the outside corner.
troy:

Come on! It’s between you and me now!

A static-­

The sky is gray, dark clouds roll in.
Raynell, 7, in her nightgown, kneels
in rose’s garden, which is now much
larger. She looks up at the bedroom
window.

Seeing if my garden growed.

Rose leans out of the window, her hair
up, wearing black.

INT. THE KITCHEN AND FRONT ROOMS—­​
MORNING
Raynell dawdles past Bono and Lyons in
dark suits, drinking coffee. She
starts upstairs. There’s a knock at
the door. She looks up to see if her
mother is coming to answer it. She
decides to answer it herself, but it
opens. Cory comes in.
He’s 25 now, a Marine Corporal. He
carries a duffel bag. Raynell stares
at him in his dress uniform, agog.
cory:

Hi.

I bet your name is Raynell.
raynell:
cory:

Uh-­huh.

Is your mama home?

raynell:

Mama . . . ​
there’s some man down here. Mama?

Raynell flies up the stairs. Cory puts
down his bag and looks around.

Cory? Cory! Lord have mercy!

Rose runs down, then stops, looking at
her son. She calls back into the

Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono.

What took you so long?

You know how the Marines are, Mama. They got to

get all their paperwork straight before they let
you do anything.
rose:

Well, I’m sure glad you made it. They let Lyons

come. Your Uncle Gabe’s still in the hospital.
They don’t know if they gonna let him out or not.
I just talked to them a little while ago.

Thanks, Jim.

Bono goes out the front door.
No one speaks. Then Lyons points to
Raynell on the stairs.

Cory, look at Raynell. Ain’t she precious? She

gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

Raynell hides behind the banisters.

You learn to deal with it like anything else. You

That’s what Papa used to say. He used to say that
when he struck out. I seen him strike out three
times in a row . . . ​
and the next time up he hit
the ball over the grandstand. Right out there in
Homestead Field. He wasn’t satisfied hitting in
the seats . . . ​
he wanted to hit it over everything! After the game he had two hundred people
standing around waiting to shake his hand. You
got to take the crookeds with the straights.
Yeah, Papa was something else.

Rose calls from the kitchen:

Lyons, I got these eggs in the pan.

lyons:

Let me go on and get these eggs, man. Get ready

to go bury Papa.

How you doing? You doing all right?

Cory nods. Lyons touches him on the
shoulder and they share a moment of
silent grief. Lyons goes into the
kitchen. Cory looks up to the top of
the stairs and sees Raynell, in her

Well, they just gonna have to hurt your feet for

They didn’t hurt then. My feet done got big-

ger.
rose:

Don’t you give me no back talk now. You get in

Raynell looks at her brand-­
new

reluctantly, she obeys
her mother. Cory makes his way to the

kitchen, passing his brother who is
wiping his plate clean.

INT. KITCHEN—­​MORNING
Cory enters the kitchen. He looks at
the photos on the wall noticing that
JFK and Martin Luther King have been
added next to the photo of Jesus. He
looks at his mother, then heads out
into the yard.

EXT. BACKYARD—­​MORNING
Cory comes down the steps into the
yard, taking it all in. He sees Troy’s
bat leaning against the tree. He walks
toward it as he hears . . .
rose (as she comes down back steps): Ain’t too much changed.

He still got that piece of rag tied to that tree.
He was out here swinging that bat. I was just
ready to go back in the house. He swung that bat
and then he just fell over. Seem like he swung
it

and

stood

there

with

grin

on

face . . . ​

talking about. I don’t want hear that kind of talk

You standing there all healthy and grown talking
about you ain’t going to your daddy’s funeral?
cory:

Mama . . . ​

rose:

I don’t want to hear it, Cory. You just get that

thought out of your head.
cory:

I’ve got to say no to him. One time in my life

I’ve got to say no.
rose:

Don’t nobody have to listen to nothing like

that. I know you and your daddy ain’t seen eye to
eye, but I ain’t gotta listen to that kind of talk
this

morning.

Disrespecting

your

daddy

ain’t

gonna make you a man, Cory. You got to find a way
to come to that on your own. Not going to your
daddy’s funeral ain’t gonna make you a man.

Cory looks around, trying to find what
to say. Then:
cory:

The whole time I was growing up . . . ​
living in

his house . . . ​
Papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere. It weighed on you and sunk
into your flesh. It would wrap around you and lay
there until you couldn’t tell which one was you
anymore. That shadow digging in your flesh. Trying
to crawl in. Trying to live through you. I’m just

136

saying I’ve got to find a way to get rid of that
shadow, Mama.
rose:

You just like him. You got him in you good.

cory:

Don’t tell me that, Mama.

rose:

You Troy Maxson all over again.

cory:

I don’t want to be Troy Maxson. I want to be me.

rose:

You can’t be nobody but who you are, Cory. That

shadow wasn’t nothing but you growing into yourself. You either got to grow into it or cut it
down to fit you. But that’s all you got to make
life with. That’s all you got to measure yourself
against that world out there. Your daddy wanted
you to be everything he wasn’t . . . ​
and at the
same time he tried to make you into everything he
was. I don’t know if he was right or wrong . . . ​
but I do know he meant to do more good than he
meant to do harm.

She stops, overwhelmed. Cory puts his
hand on her hand. She takes his hand,
squeezes it, turns it over, holding on.
rose:

Sometimes when he touched he bruised. And some-

times when he took me in his arms he cut.

(beat)
When I first met your daddy I thought, “Here is
a man I can lay down with and make a baby.” That’s
the first thing I thought when I seen him . . . ​
“Rose Lee, here is a man that you can open your-

self up to and be filled to bursting. Here is a man
that can fill all them empty spaces you been tipping around the edges of.”

(beat)
When your daddy walked through the house he was
so big he filled it up. That was my first mistake.
Not to make him leave some room for me. But I
wanted a house that I could sing in, and that’s
what your daddy gave me. I didn’t know to keep up
his strength I had to give up little pieces of
mine. I took on his life as mine and mixed up the
pieces so that you couldn’t hardly tell which was
which anymore. It was my choice. It was my life and
I didn’t have to live it like that. But that’s what
life offered me in the way of being a woman and I
took it. I grabbed hold of it with both hands. By
the time Raynell came into the house . . . ​
I didn’t
want to make my blessing off of nobody’s misfortune, but I took on to Raynell like she was all
them babies I had wanted and never had.

The phone rings.
rose:

Like I’d been blessed to relive a part of my

life. And if the Lord see fit to keep up my
strength . . . ​
I’m gonna do her just like your
daddy did you . . . ​
I’m gonna give her the best
of what’s in me.

Raynell comes out with her old shoes on.

Blue treed a possum out on a limb

Blue looked at me and I looked at him
Grabbed that possum and put him in a sack

Old Blue’s feets was big and round
Never allowed a possum to touch the ground.

crosses over to the tree. Rose stands at the screen
door watching him. She takes a look at the threatening sky, about to return to the house, when she
sees Gabriel. He’s older but healthier, more vital, in a new suit and a hat. One arm is behind
his back. Rose is speechless with surprise.

Gabriel looks at each of them, then
back to Rose. He takes his hand from

gabriel:

Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint

Peter to open the Gates.

Not knowing what she’s agreeing to,
Rose nods.
gabriel:

Troy, you ready?

Gabriel waits for an answer. Raynell
comes out on the porch and hides
behind Rose, shy. Gabe smiles at her,
and she returns his smile.
gabriel:

You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter

to open the Gates. You get ready now.

Gabriel puts the trumpet to his lips,
two decades of waiting for this moment

finally over. He inhales and blows into
the horn. No sound. Gabriel blows
again, a huge effort: Nothing.
Then Gabe begins to dance, slow and
strange, eerie, skeletal and life-­
giving, a dance of atavistic signature
and ritual. Lyons goes to Gabe,
embracing him, trying to stop him.
Gabriel pushes Lyons away.
He points the trumpet at the ground and
inhales as he arcs the horn upwards
till he’s on his toes, closing his
eyes, putting the mouthpiece to his
lips; Gabriel blows once more, and:
From the tarnished, battered bell of
the broken trumpet comes an ear-­
splitting note, growing higher and
louder till it’s almost like a woman’s
scream.
In the clouds directly above Gabe, a
small aperture opens up and a pillar
of brilliant light descends, bathing
Gabriel and his horn in gold. The
trumpet’s blast stops; the silence is
huge and abrupt.
CLOSE-­
UP: Gabriel, his face raised up,
bathed in light. He lowers his
trumpet. He says to God:
gabriel:

That’s the way that go!

high above the yard; the men have gone
