INT. MEREDITH’S LIVING ROOM - SUNRISE

A rambling but shabby home. Light filters through curtains.
Meet MEREDITH GREY (32) smart, awkward, irreverent, hard-working
and...well, naked. She fumbles for her clothes.
This is...

DEREK (O.S.)

There’s a naked man lying by the fireplace we didn’t notice
before. DEREK (late 30s), dashing, sexy, charming -- the man we
all wish existed, is just waking. Meredith dresses quickly,
uncomfortable with his presence.
MEREDITH
This is humiliating on so many levels.
-- You have to go.
DEREK
Come back down here.
where we left off...

We’ll pick up

MEREDITH
You have to go. I’m late. Which isn’t
what you want to be on your first day
of work so...you have to go.
She’s tossing his clothes at him. Derek sits up, looking
around. The room is oddly disorganized -- too much furniture,
post-its stuck to drawers, layers of dust over everything.
DEREK
You actually live here?
No.

Yes.

MEREDITH
Kind of.

It’s nice. Dusty. Odd. But nice.
How do you kind of live here?

I moved in two weeks ago. From Boston.
It’s my mother’s house. Was my
mother’s house. I’m selling it.
I’m sorry.
For what?

DEREK
You said “was”...
MEREDITH
My mother’s not dead, she’s...You know
what? We don’t have to do the thing.
DEREK
Oh, we can do anything you want.
MEREDITH
The thing. Exchange the personal
details of our lives, pretend we
care...Look, I’m going upstairs to
shower. And you won’t be here when I
get back. So goodbye...?
DEREK

Derek.
Derek.

MEREDITH
-- Meredith.

Aware of the irony, they shake hands.
DEREK
It was nice making your acquaintance.
Bye, Derek.

Meredith escapes upstairs.

Meredith races up to fall in with 19 mostly male INTERNS
(includes Izzie, George and Cristina). They gather around
RICHARD WEBBER (50s), gruff, authoritative, poetic -- you know
without having to ask that he’s the man in charge.
RICHARD
A month ago you were in med school
being taught by doctors. Now...
He pushes open doors that lead into...

Gleaming.

Sterile.

Sleek.

RICHARD
...you are the doctors. The seven
years you spend as a surgical resident
will be the best and worst of your
life. You will be pushed to your
breaking point. Look around you. Say
hello to your competition. Eight of
you will switch to an easier specialty.
Five of you will crack under the
pressure. Two of you will be asked to
leave. This is the starting line.
This is your arena. How well you play,
it’s up to you.
The interns shift, freaked.

Meredith swallows, nervous.

MEREDITH (V.O.)
Like I said, I’m screwed.

In one corner, guys cluster around Izzie; she tries to smile.
Meredith listens for her name. Cristina stands near her. They

MEREDITH
Only 6 women. Out of 20.
CRISTINA
Yeah. And I heard one of them is a

Maybe it’s professional jealousy.
Maybe she’s brilliant and everyone
calls her a Nazi because they’re
jealous. Maybe she’s nice.

Izzie is all smiles, friendly.

I’m sleeping, don’t wake me unless your
patient is actually dying. Rule #4:
The dying patient better not be dead
when I get there. Not only will you
have killed someone but you would’ve
woken me for no good reason. We clear?
Meredith raises her hand as Bailey’s PAGER SOUNDS.

CRISTINA
Yes, you are. Only it makes you feel

Screw you. I don’t get picked for
surgeries because I slept with my boss.
And I didn’t get into med school
because I have a famous mother. Some
of us have to earn what we get.
Stung, Meredith backs away. As she leaves, she passes Alex who
hangs out at the nurses station with a bunch of male interns.
ALEX
How’s it hanging, Nurse Grey?
The other interns laugh.

I promised her I’d make her look cool.
Apparently, being a bald beauty queen
is the worst thing that ever happened
in the history of the world.
MEREDITH
Look, did you choose me for the surgery
because I slept with you?
DEREK
Yes. -- I’m kidding.
MEREDITH
I’m not gonna scrub in for the surgery.
You should ask Cristina. She wants it
and IDEREK
You’re one of Katie’s doctors. And on
your first day with very little
training, you helped save her life.
You earned the right to see her case

BAILEY
Surgery. They call it a game, act like
it’s fun. But a game has referees.
Someone to throw the flag when they
don’t play fair. To keep everyone
pleasant and civilized. But if you
want pleasant and civilized, you
should’ve gone into dermatology. You
want to be a surgeon, you cheat and you
kick and you fight like hell for what
you can get. And if they call you a

Derek works on Katie, his eyes going from the microscope to the
screen to the monitors -- constantly on alert, completely
skilled and calm. He has a two headed microscope and one of the
senior residents watches Derek work through the 2nd lens.
