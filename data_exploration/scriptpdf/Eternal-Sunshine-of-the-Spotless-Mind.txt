EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - DAY

1

It's gray. The platform is packed with business commuters:
suits, overcoats. There is such a lack of color it almost
seems as if it's a black and white shot, except one commuter
holds a bright red heart-shaped box of candy under his arm.
The platform across the tracks is empty. As an almost empty
train pulls up to that platform, one of the suited men breaks
out of the crowd, lurches up the stairs two at a time,
hurries across the overpass and down the stairs to the other
side, just at the empty train stops. The doors open and the
man gets on that train. As the empty train pulls from the
station, the man watches the crowd of commuters through the
train's dirty window. We see his face for the first time.
This is Joel Barish. He is in his 30's, sallow, a bit puffy.
His hair is a little messy, his suit is either vintage or
just old and dirty and sort of threadbare. His bright tie
has a photograph of a rodeo printed on it.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - DAY

Joel talks on a payphone. The wind howls around him. He
tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks. His speech is a
self-conscious mumble, especially difficult to hear over the
elements.
JOEL
Hi, Cindy. It's Joel. Joel. I'm not
feeling well this morning. No, food
poisoning, I think. I had clams. Clams!
I'm sorry it took me so long to call in,
but I've been vomiting a lot. I've been
vomiting! Yes, that's right, a lot!

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He
passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each
other.

from his briefcase. He opens it and reads his last entry.
JOEL (V.O.)
January 6, 2001. Nothing much. Naomi
and I coexisting. Roommates. Nothing.
Will it go on like this forever? My best
guess? Yes.

Under the entry is a detailed drawing of a paranoid, wildeyed man huddled in the corner of a damp basement lit by a
bare bulb on a cord. Joel notices something odd: a great
many pages have been torn out after the last entry. He
ponders it for a moment, then writes on the next page:
JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Valentine's Day 2003. First entry in two
years. Where did those years go? If
you're not careful it gets away from you.
And then it's over and you're dead. And
within a few years who even remembers you
were here?
(thinks)
Called in sick today. Took the train out
to Montauk.
(thinks)
Cold.
(thinks some more)
Don't know what else to say. I saw Naomi
last night. First time since the breakup. We had sex. It was odd to fall into
our old familiar sex life so easily.
Like no time has passed. Suddenly we're
talking about getting together again. I
guess that's good.
He has no other thoughts, does some work on the drawing on
the opposite page. He glances up, spots a female figure in
the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out
against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.
This is Clementine. She's in her early thirties, zaftig. He
watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his
drawing, or at least pretends to. Once she has passed, he
watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the
ocean. Joel writes.
JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Constitutionally incapable of making eyecontact with a woman I don't know. Guess
I'd better get back with Naomi. Ought to
buy her a Valentine. She loves roses, I
believe.

INT. DINER - DAY

8

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. An old
couple drink coffee at the counter. Joel sits in a booth and
eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. In
his notebook he is drawing a wizened old man with a metal
detector. His metal detector has led him to another dead old
man clutching a metal detector. Joel meekly, unsuccessfully,
tries to get the waitress's attention for more coffee.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel
glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth
and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.
CLEMENTINE
Hi, it's me again! My home away from
home.
Coffee?
God, yes.

WAITRESS
CLEMENTINE
You've saved my life!

Brrr!

The waitress pours the coffee.
WAITRESS
You know what you want?
CLEMENTINE
(laughing)
Ain't that the question of the century.
The waitress is not amused.

Clementine gets business-like.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
You got grilled cheese and tomato soup
again today?
WAITRESS
We're having a run on it.
The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.
CLEMENTINE
(calling)
And some cream, please.
Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.

Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

10

Joel sits on a bench waiting for the train. Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his
hands, pulls his journal from his briefcase and tries to
write in order to conceal his awkwardness.
JOEL (V.O.)
Why do I fall in love with every woman I
see who shows me the least bit of
attention?

INT. TRAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

11

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching
him. The train is picking up speed. Finally:

Hi!

CLEMENTINE
(calling over the rumble)

Joel looks over.
JOEL
I'm sorry?
What?

CLEMENTINE
I couldn't hear you.

JOEL
I said, I'm sorry.
CLEMENTINE
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

JOEL
No, I didn't know if you were talking to
me, so...
She looks around the empty car.
Really?

CLEMENTINE

JOEL
(embarrassed)
Well, I didn't want to assume.
CLEMENTINE
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the
leap and assume someone is talking to you
in an otherwise empty car.
Anyway.

JOEL
Sorry.

Hi.

Hello.

Hi.

Clementine giggles, makes her way down the aisle toward Joel.
CLEMENTINE
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't
have to scream? Not that I don't need to
scream sometimes, believe you me.
(pause)
But I don't want to bug you if you're
trying to write something.
JOEL
(mumbling)
No, I'm just... I don't really, um ...
What?

CLEMENTINE
You don't really what?

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.
JOEL
It's okay if you want to sit down.
CLEMENTINE
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
I have a long trip ahead of me.
(sits across aisle from Joel)
How far are you going? On the train, I
mean, of course. Not in life.
JOEL

He gets uncomfortable.

I don't think so.
Hmmmm.
Noble?
Sure.

CLEMENTINE
Do you ever shop at Barnes and

CLEMENTINE
That's it. That's me: book slave there

I gotta quit

JOEL

I think I'd

CLEMENTINE
Well, I'm there. I've seen you, man. I
hide in the back as much as is humanly
possible. You have a cell phone? I need
to quit right this minute. I'll call in
dead. I'll go on the dole like my daddy
before me. Might be the hair.
JOEL
What might?
CLEMENTINE
Changes a lot. That's why you might not
recognize me. What color am I today?
(pulls a strand in front of her
eyes, studies it)
Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The
color. Snappy name, huh?

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
Blue ruin is cheap gin, in case you're
wondering.
Yeah.

JOEL
Tom Waits says it in --

Exactly!

CLEMENTINE
Tom Waits.

Which song?

JOEL
I can't remember.
CLEMENTINE
Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names. Red
Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those
names. How do you get a job like that?
That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
JOEL
I don't really know how -CLEMENTINE
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
JOEL
You think that could possibly be a fulltime job? How many hair colors could
there be? Fifty, tops?
CLEMENTINE
(pissy)
Somebody's got that job.
(excited)
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.
Anyway, there are endless color
possibilities and I'd be great at it.
JOEL
(mumbly)
I'm sure you would.
CLEMENTINE
My writing career! Your hair written by
Clementine Kruczynski.

The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

JOEL
I don't know that album --

CLEMENTINE
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their
colors. More than once. I'm getting too
old for this. But it keeps me from
having to develop an actual personality.
I apply my personality in a paste. You?
JOEL
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
CLEMENTINE
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
know, do you?
Sorry.

JOEL
I was just trying to be nice.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah, I got it.
There's a silence.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't
do that; you're trying to be nice.
JOEL
I don't know any jokes about your name.
CLEMENTINE

Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a

JOEL
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
CLEMENTINE
(pissy)
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
JOEL
I don't know. I was just... I don't
know. I was just... You seemed nice, so
-CLEMENTINE
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other
adjectives? There's careless and snotty
and overbearing and argumentative...

JOEL
(mumbling)
Well, anyway... Sorry.
They sit in silence for a while.
CLEMENTINE
I just don't think "nice" is a
particularly interesting thing to be.

adjective? I guess it can be an adverb,

The conductor turns to Clementine.

She fishes in her bag.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is
pandering. Cowardly. And life is more
interesting than that. Or should be.
Jesus God, I hope it is... someday.

I know itâ€™s here.
The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
I don't need nice. I don't need myself
to be it and I don't need anyone else to
be it at me.
JOEL
Okay, I understand.
Shit.

CLEMENTINE
Shit. I know it's here.

Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through. Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner. It's The Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rogers.
Joel eyes the book.

Damn it. DAMN IT!

Oh. Here.
She hands the conductor the ticket, smiles sweetly.

The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls an airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody
gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out.

yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever,
I'm a little out of sorts today.
JOEL
(trying for a joke)
Hey, Old Yeller would be a good color.
CLEMENTINE
(not seeming to hear)
My embarrassing admission is I really
like that you're nice. Right now,
anyway. I can't tell from one moment to
the next what I'm going to like. But
right now I'm glad you are.
JOEL
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some
stuff I need to -- I'm trying to work out
some -- I'm writing some thoughts, sort
of.
CLEMENTINE
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...

shoulder)
Take care, then.
JOEL
(pulling notebook from
briefcase)
Probably see you at the book store.
CLEMENTINE

car)
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Old Yeller is funny, by the way.

She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window.
Hi.

I could give you a ride if you need.

CLEMENTINE
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You sure?
Yeah?
He pulls over.

It's cold.

CLEMENTINE
It is frosty.

She climbs in.

They drive.

JOEL
Where do you live?
CLEMENTINE
You're not a stalker or anything, right?

Joel turns.

They drive in silence.

Joel pulls over.

A FEW MINUTES LATER: Joel stands in the living room, somewhat
nervously. He tries to calm himself by focusing on the
surroundings. He looks at the books on her shelves.
Clementine is in the kitchen. We see her as she passes by
the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting.
CLEMENTINE
Thanks! I like it, too. Been here about
four years. It's really cheap. My
downstairs neighbor is old so she's
quiet, which is great. And the
landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
great, and I have a little porch in the
back, which is great, because I can read
there, and listen to my crickets and...
Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Two blue ruins...
Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
You like that?
JOEL
Very much.
CLEMENTINE
This... this guy gave that to me, just,
like, recently. I like it, too. I like
crows. I think I used to be a crow.
She caws and hands Joel a drink.

on the back.
Clementine takes the photo off the wall and shows Joel the
inscription on back.
Frost?

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
(impressed)
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
lover by any stretch. His stuff seems
strictly grade school to me. But this
made me cry for some reason. Maybe
because it is grade school. Y'know?
JOEL
It's pretty.
CLEMENTINE
I miss grade school. I don't know why
I'm calling it grade school all of a
sudden. When I went we called it
elementary school. But I like grade
school better. Sounds like something
someone from the forties would call it.
I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore
hats. Anyway, cheers!
Cheers.

They clink glasses. Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink. Joel sips. She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

You pick it.

You just say. I'm not really -CLEMENTINE (O.S.)

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's. He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Oh, excellent choice.
She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player. The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow. Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

CLEMENTINE
No, stay. Just for a little while.
(opens her eyes, brightly)
Refill?
JOEL
No, I sort of have to go and -CLEMENTINE
Stop mumbling.
She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
God bless alcohol, is what I say. Where
would I be without it. Jesus, Mary, and
Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about
that.
She giggles. Joel looks around the room again. There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato. He stares at the potatoes,
confused. Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill
for herself.
Thanks.

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
Drink up, young man. It'll make the
whole seduction part less repugnant.
Joel looks a little alarmed.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
I'm just kidding. C'mon. Or was I?
She laughs maniacally, sits back on the couch, closes her
eyes. Joel watches her, looks at her breasts. She opens her
eyes, smiles drunkenly at him, winks.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

Yeah?

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
telling me I'm psychic. She should know.
Do you believe in that stuff?
JOEL
I don't know.
CLEMENTINE
Me neither. But sometimes I have
premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe
that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know,
you think something and then it happens,
or you think a word and then someone says
it? Y'know?
JOEL
Yeah, I don't know.

It's hard to know.

CLEMENTINE
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my
feeling about it. It's hard to know.
Like, okay, but how many times do I think
something and it doesn't happen? That's
what you're saying, right? You forget
about those times. Right?
JOEL
Yeah, I guess. The human mind creates
order where there is none.
CLEMENTINE
(dreamy beat)
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
It's helpful to think there's some order
to things. You're kind of closedmouthed, aren't you?
JOEL
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting.
I go to work. I go home. I don't know
what to say. You should read my journal.
It's just, like, blank.
CLEMENTINE
(considers this)
Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm
always anxious thinking I'm not living my
life to the fullest, y'know? Taking
advantage of every possibility?

She looks at him really hard for a long moment. Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't. He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.
CLEMENTINE
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled
at you before about it. God, I'm
dreadful.
JOEL
I have a tendency to use that word too
much. It is a little nondescript.
CLEMENTINE
I like you. That's the thing about my
psychic thing. I think that's my
greatest psychic power, that I get a
sense about people. My problem is I
never trust it. But I get it. And with
you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I
can tell. There's a lot of stuff going
on in your brain. I can tell. My
goal... can I tell you my goal?
JOEL
(mock put out)
Yeah, I guess.
CLEMENTINE
(ala Paul Simon)
What's the goal, Joel?
(laughs)
My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
through me? Do you know what I mean?

what is true is constantly changing. You

No, not at all.

I don't either. I used to. But I'm

He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball,
but he's really stuck on me, which is
flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And
he's, like, a dope, but he says these
smart and moving things sometimes, out of
nowhere, that just break my heart. He's
the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.

JOEL

CLEMENTINE
It made me cry. But, anyway, we went up
to Boston, because I had this urge to lie
on my back on the Charles River. It gets
frozen this time of year.
JOEL
That sounds scary.
CLEMENTINE
Exactly! I used to do it in college and
I had this urge to go do it again, so I
got Patrick and we drove all night to get
there and he was sweet and said nice
things to me, but I was really
disappointed to be there with him.
Y'know? And that's where my psychic
stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't
right with him. Y'know?

collecting mementos in his apartment. He screams.

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines. The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines. Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.
PATRICK
The voltage looks fine.
STAN
Then check the connections.
Patrick fiddles with some jacks.
PATRICK
Does that help?
STAN
Yeah, that looks better.

Thanks.

This shuts Clementine up. She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment. Joel is immediately sorry he's said this. He
follows her around.

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of

farther away.

in a monotonous, robotic manner. She sips tea from a coffee
mug with her photo on it.

You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an
open book. I tell you everything. Every
damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust
me.

Clementine. Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

intimacy is. I'm really pissed that you

why it doesn't often happen to people who
break easily or have sharp edges, or who
have to be carefully kept. Generally by
the time you are Real, most of your hair
has been loved off, and your eyes drop
out and you get loose in the joints and
very shabby. But these things don't
matter at all, because once you are Real
you can't be ugly, except to people who
don't understand."
She's weeping. Joel is stroking her hair. They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket. It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

Thanks, Stan. I owe you big time.
Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack. He
pulls out the red gift-wrapped box Joel was going to give
Clementine for Valentine's Day, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a bunch of letters, flips through them, keeping an
eye on the bedroom door. He finds what he's looking for.
The handwriting is a woman's. He reads:
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Dear, dear Joel: Thank you so much for
joining me on the Charles River last
night. I know how nervous you were about
stepping onto the ice, but that you
overcame your fear just to please me is
so fucking sweet I could eat you. I
will! -- When we watched the stars on
our backs and you took my hand and said,

Clementine looks over at him. Her eyes are filled with love

(screaming at the fading
crumbling night sky)
Can you hear me? I want to call it off!

Joel scrunches his face, focuses intently, shakes with
concentration.

We see snippets, details: Joel and Clementine in front of a
diorama in the Natural History Museum, Joel and Clementine
arguing in a car, having sex on the hall stairs of
Clementine's apartment building, laughing and holding hands
at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in
bed, Joel watching her sleep, listening to Rain Dogs
together, drinking at a bar, Joel and Clementine playing a
board game with Rob and Carrie. Joel arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak. Still
desperately clutching Clementine's hand, he yells to
Mierzwiak.
Please!

JOEL

Joel turns to look at Clementine. It's no longer her. He is
holding the hand of some woman he's never seen before. He
drops her hand with a panicked yelp. And runs into the
decayed Lacuna office.

robotically or something.

He stares at her a long time, softens.

The memory and Clementine are fading around him. Even though

her finger.
JOEL

CLEMENTINE

Nope.

Pokey. Pokemon.

Joel looks out the window at the rain. He feels her skin

in bulky socks.

Four year old Joel runs and hides under the kitchen table.
Joel watches his mother at the stove stirring a saucepan and
talking to a neighbor woman also in period clothes. The
neighbor has Clementine's face, but is completely engaged in
conversation with the mother. We can't make out what they're
saying. Joel draws a picture in crayon on the bottom of the
table top. Joel's mother excuses herself and leaves the
room. Clementine looks around, spots Joel under the table.
She approaches, bends down to his level.

take it with me. Who am I?

Joel lies on his back. Clementine sits over him holding a
pillow. They are both laughing.
CLEMENTINE
Okay, ready? Again?
He stops laughing, nods seriously. She puts the pillow over
his face and holds it down hard. Joel struggles and screams,
muffled by the pillow. Suddenly he goes limp. Clementine
pulls the pillow off his face and looks horrified.

Oh, Clem!
He closes his eyes.

Don't!
The room becomes:

EXT. JOEL'S CHILDHOOD SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

105

Joel is one of a group of five year olds. He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon. The other
boys are goading him. Clementine, now the little girl with
the puppy we saw in the photograph earlier, watches with the
other kids.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.
JOEL
God, I wish I knew you when we were kids.
My life would've turned out so
differently.

That's where I live. Lived.
She lays down on the front lawn of the childhood house.
CLEMENTINE
It's my turn, sweetie.
She hands him a pillow. He smiles and puts it over her face.
She struggles, then acts dead. After a long moment of no
reaction from Clementine, Joel pulls the pillow from her
face. She is gone. His childhood house is crumbling.

Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

INT./EXT. THE VAN/JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette. He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window. He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary. They're talking as Howard works. It
appears to be a very serious discussion. A car pulls up
outside. Stan turns to see. A middle-aged woman gets out.

In the window, Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened
and he and Mary kiss again. This leads to groping, partial
undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the
unconscious Joel. The woman checks the address on Joel's
building. Stan recognizes her. As the woman approaches the
only lit window, Stan agonizes over what to do. He honks his
horn. The woman looks back at the van, then hurries to the
window. Mierzwiak and Mary, in partial undress, squint out
into the night. The woman and Mierzwiak lock eyes. He
practically shrieks and jumps up.

life. You'll come to a point someday
where it'll be too late. You'll be sewn
into your fate...
JOEL
It was horrifying, seeing my father like
that. There was no hope for me if his
life was such a failure. And he saw
failure in me, too, written in my future.
Clementine watches the confused, frightened Joel.
CLEMENTINE
Joel, you're not sewn in.

He's wrong.

Clementine leads Joel into a crowd of people outside a

Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
And we'll take it from there.

Um, okay, I like you immediately. At
the job interview. You seemed so...
important and mature. And I loved that
you were helping all these people. You

that. I was so tongue-tied around you at
first. I wanted you to think I was
smart. You were so nice. I loved the

On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered
if I had made a terrible mistake. I
almost reached for the phone about a
thousand times. I thought I could take
it back, erase it, explain I had
momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
myself we weren't happy. That was the
truth. That what we were was safe. It
was unfair to you and to me to stay in a
relationship for that reason. I thought
about Clementine and the spark when I was
with her, but then I thought what you and
I had was real and adult and therefore
significant even if it wasn't much fun.
But I wanted fun. I saw other people
having fun and I wanted it. Then I
thought fun is a lie, that no one is
really having fun; I'm being suckered by
advertising and movie bullshit... then I
thought, maybe not, maybe not. And then I
thought, as I always do at this point in
my argument, about dying.

orange sweatshirt.

VOICE-OVER
I remember being drawn to you
even then. I thought, how
odd, I'm drawn to someone's
back. I thought, I love this
woman because she's alone
down there looking out at the
ocean.

JOEL (CONT'D)
But I went back to my food. The next
thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
out of the corner of my eye.
A shot of the orange sleeve.
Hi there.
Hi.

Joel looks up.

CLEMENTINE

JOEL

VOICE-OVER
I was so nervous. What were
you doing there, I wondered.
Your hair was lime green.
Green revolution.

JOEL
You said...
CLEMENTINE
I saw you sitting over here. By
yourself. I thought, thank God, someone
normal, who doesn't know how interact at
these things either.
Yeah.

JOEL
I don't ever know what to say.

CLEMENTINE
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
you're uncomfortable, but, y'know... I'm
such a loser. Every time I come to a
party I tell myself I'm going to be
different and it's always exactly the
same and then I hate myself after for
being such a clod.

JOEL
Even then I didn't believe
you entirely. I thought how
could you be talking to me if
you couldn't talk to people?

VOICE-OVER
But I thought, I don't know,
I thought it was cool that
you were sensitive enough to
know what I was feeling and
that you were attracted to
it.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of
people do well at this stuff?
VOICE-OVER
And I just liked you so much.
You did?

CLEMENTINE
You liked me?

JOEL
You know I did.
CLEMENTINE
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
JOEL
You said -She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.
CLEMENTINE
I'm Clementine. Can I
borrow a piece of your
chicken?

JOEL
And you picked it out of my
plate before I could answer
and it felt so intimate like
we were already lovers.

JOEL (CONT'D)
I remember --

VOICE-OVER
The grease on your chin in
the bonfire light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.
CLEMENTINE
Oh God, how horrid.
I'm Joel.

Hi, Joel.

Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my

Hound? That sort of thing?
CLEMENTINE
Yeah, like that.
JOEL
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when
I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
doll. I think your name is magic.
She smiles.
CLEMENTINE

This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone
soon.
I know.

CLEMENTINE
What do we do?
Enjoy it.

JOEL
Say goodbye.

She nods.
Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.
JOEL (CONT'D)
So you're still on the
Zoloft?

VOICE-OVER
Next thing I remember we were
walking down near the surf.
You were walking as close as
you could to the water

No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel

JOEL
I think she's great.
Me too.

CLEMENTINE
There's this poem --

Seems too coincidental that way.

C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's
coming here tonight, believe me. This

JOEL
I hesitated for what seemed

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled up like refuse
outside the moving car window. He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie. It, too, is decaying. Soon all
has crumbled into dust. Everything goes black.

about waking her; she seems so peaceful. He gingerly touches
her arm. She doesn't wake. He touches it again. Still
nothing. He touches her face.

head to the house. He leans his head back against the
headrest and closes his eyes. He's happy, tired, and a bit
anxious. He opens his eyes and casually watches a distant

and keeps walking down the block past Clementine's house.
Joel watches in his rearview mirror as Patrick continues down

in her choice of a change of clothing and toiletries. A
phone message is playing in the background.
PATRICK'S VOICE
... so where are you, Clem? I'm worried.
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't
know what I did. What did I do? I love
you so much. I'd do anything to make you
happy. Just tell me what you want me to
do and I'll do it. Listen, I'm going to
stop by in the morning just to make sure
you're okay. I'm worried.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - MORNING

163A

Joel waits. Clementine emerges from her place with her
overnight bag and her mail. She gets into the car.
CLEMENTINE
Vamanos, senor.
Joel smiles at her, starts the car and drives off. They pass
Patrick sitting on someone's stoop watching them. Neither of
them notices him. Clementine sifts through her mail.
JOEL
I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?

CLEMENTINE

JOEL
I had the best fucking time I've ever had
in my fucking life last night.
CLEMENTINE
That's better, senor.
She looks at a small padded manila envelope with her name and
address scrawled on it. She rips it open, pulls out a note
and an audio cassette. She reads the note.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
This is weird.
(reading aloud)
Dear Clementine. We've met but you don't
remember me. I worked for a company you
hired to have part of your memory erased.

You've erased your two year relationship

Jesus, that's creepy.

How'd they know we

Clementine shrugs and inserts the cassette in the tape
player. (note: the tape plays throughout the scene under
Joel and Clementine's dialogue)
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
My name is Clementine Kruczynski and I'm
here to erase Joel Barish.
MIERZWIAK'S VOICE
Tell me all about your relationship.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Well, he's a giant asshole. Is that
enough?
MIERZWIAK'S VOICE
No, I'm afraid we really do need to
delve.
JOEL
What is this?
CLEMENTINE
I don't know.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
I can't stand to even look at him. His
pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile. That
sort of wounded puppy shit he does.
Y'know? Is it so much to ask for an
actual man to have sex with?
JOEL
What are you doing?

CLEMENTINE
I'm not doing anything.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
... I might as well be a lesbian. At
least I could have someone pretty to look
at while I'm fucking. Not that we fuck
anymore. I mean, I don't call it fucking
on the rare occasions that it happens.

Not fucking... faking. Honey, let's fake
tonight. Make a few faces, get it over
with. Shit...
JOEL
Why did you make this tape?
I completely don't understand
what you're doing.
JOEL
It's your voice!

CLEMENTINE
I didn't do this!

I know!

CLEMENTINE

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
... Now the only fuel keeping it going is
my feeling sorry for him. He's so needy.
The way he looks at me, like I should be
ashamed of myself for going out and
having some fun in my life. I mean, I've
got to have it somewhere, right? I
suppose I could sit and watch television
with him until we both kick. There's a
plan. Y'know Joel is a guy who is never
going to do anything with his life...
CLEMENTINE
Joel, I don't understand.

I swear.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
... I remember this time I made him come
out onto this frozen river with me. He
was terrified. Like a goddamn girl...
Joel turns the car around.
JOEL
So someone just recorded you saying this
without you knowing you were saying it.
CLEMENTINE
I don't know! Maybe it's
some kind of Future thing,
like a look into the future.
Like that thing in Scrooge!
Maybe some force is trying to
help us. I think I've read
about that happening. I'm
sure I have.

JOEL
This is fucked up! That's
ridiculous. This is fucked
up! It's called A Christmas
Carol, not Scrooge.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
...Ugh. I don't want to think about all
the time I've wasted in this quoteunquote relationship. Isn't it about
fun?

Joel stops the car in back in front of Clementine's house.
She's crying.
CLEMENTINE
I didn't say this. I don't know what
this is. Look, I just -She stops talking.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
... I mean, shouldn't the good times out
number the shit times? I don't know. I
don't know what the hell to expect. But
the bloom is certainly fucking off the
rose at this point. I want to have kids.
I can't be wasting my time with this kind
of disaster. Not to mention, do I want
my kids to have his creepy little genes?
Joel just stares straight ahead.
CLEMENTINE
(quietly, resignedly)
Okay. I'm gonna go.
She gets out of the car.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
...How could I even look at them if they
looked like him? How could anybody?
Y'know, I think about that...
Joel ejects the tape, hands it to her, and closes the door.
He drives off, leaving her just standing there, crying.
After a moment, Patrick appears seemingly from nowhere.
PATRICK
Clem, what's wrong? Oh, sweetheart... I
was just coming over to -CLEMENTINE
Get away from me! Get the fuck away from
me! Get away from me! Get away from me!

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - MORNING

It's a bit later. Clementine drives slowly down Joel's
street. In her hand she's got a ripped out page from a phone
book with his address circled. She spots his car on the
street and parks behind it.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

163C

Clementine approaches the apartment entrance. As she nears,
the door opens and Frank the neighbor emerges. He holds the
door open for her.
FRANK
Hey, Clementine.
She has no idea who he is and she's freaked out.
Hey.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

164A

Clementine watches the hall looking at apartment numbers
until she comes to Joel's. The door is ajar. Inside she can
hear Joel's voice, but can't make out what he's saying. She
stands there for a moment then enters.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Clementine looks around; the place is not what she expected.
She comes upon Joel in his study. The room looks as if it's
been ransacked. He's listening to a tape of his own voice
and holding a drawing. She stands and listens, too,
unbeknownst to him.
JOEL'S VOICE
... that's Clementine all over. Complete
selfishness. Complete and utter
disregard for anyone else's feelings.
Hi.

CLEMENTINE

He looks, up, his eyes are red-rimmed and wild-looking.

Hey.

Joel's taped voice drones on in the background. He holds up
the drawing for Clementine to see. It's the picture of her
in the skeleton costume.

She doesn't know what

CLEMENTINE
Well, you made me look skinny.
JOEL'S VOICE
She's like a train wreck, tearing people
apart leaving chaos and destruction in
her wake. And ...
CLEMENTINE
It's a nice place you have.
JOEL
Thanks. Y'know, it's... relatively
cheap. I like it. The location's good.
It's not usually this messy.
CLEMENTINE
It's nice.
JOEL'S VOICE
... seems obvious to me that it's all
based on some kind of mammoth insecurity.
JOEL
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
JOEL'S VOICE
She plays at being this rebel, freespirit.
CLEMENTINE
It's okay.
(beat)
I like you so much. I hate that I said
mean things about you.
JOEL
I'll turn this off.
CLEMENTINE
No. I think it's... I think it's only
fair.
JOEL'S VOICE
I mean, the whole thing with the hair?
It's all bullshit. And it's sort of
pathetic when you're thirty and you're
still doing that shit.

Do you have any whiskey?
Yeah.

I'm cold.

Clementine enters the study as Joel exits into the kitchen.

Joel finds his almost empty bottle of scotch in the cabinet.
He pours the little left into two glasses, exits.

INT. JOEL'S STUDY - DAY

Joel enters with the two glasses of whiskey. Clementine sits
on the couch, looking stunned. He hands her a glass.
JOEL
Sorry, I thought there was more.
JOEL'S VOICE
... that's what's occurred to me that
night, that the only way Clem thinks she
can get people to like her is to fuck
them or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of them. And
I think she's so desperate and insecure
that she'll sooner or later she'll just
go around fucking everyone.
CLEMENTINE
I don't do that.
JOEL
I wouldn't have thought so.
CLEMENTINE
Because I don't.
I know.

Joel turns off the tape.

Because it really hurts me that you said
that. Because I don't do that.
Okay.

JOEL
I'm sorry.

They both stare off.

Finally:

CLEMENTINE
I'm sorry about this. I'm
going to go. I'm a little
confused. I don't think I
can be here.

Okay.

JOEL
Yeah. I'm sorry.

Clementine gets up.
CLEMENTINE
So... bye. It was nice meeting you and
all.
JOEL
Yeah, you too.

I had a good time.

She exits.

Joel with a worried, knit brow. Clementine cracks up.
Okay.
Really?

I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a

JOEL
I can't think of anything I don't like
about you right now.
