HIS HEAD DOWN, EAR COCKED AS CYRUS WHISPERS INTO IT. FITZ'S
FACE SHOWS HIS SHOCK. THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR BEHIND HIM, WE
CAN SEE MELLIE MAKING HER WAY INTO THE ROOM, HER FACE STONY
AND COLD.

1A

-CYRUS, SHOULDERS SLUMPED, LEANS AGAINST HIS DESK. FLUTTERING
IN THE AIR ON ITS WAY TO HIS FEET IS THE VIVID FRONT PAGE OF
THE DISTRICT TIMES. ITS HEADLINE SCREAMS: FIRST MISTRESS?

-WE'RE PEEKING THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE OVAL. FAR AWAY. BUT
NOT TOO FAR TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF MELLIE RAGE-WHISPERING AT
CYRUS, her face contorted with rage. BEYOND THEM, FITZ PLAYS
PEEK-A-BOO WITH BABY TEDDY, determined to remain OBLIVIOUS.

-WHITE HOUSE AIDES AND ASSISTANTS (INCLUDING ETHAN) STAND
STARING UP AT THE BANKS OF TELEVISIONS, THEIR NECKS STRAINING,
WATCHING AS AN IMAGE OF OLIVIA POPE AND FITZGERALD GRANT
APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. ONE AIDE, JEANNINE, IS CLEARLY TRYING
NOT TO CRY.

-BENEATH A PORTRAIT OF JACKIE O, MELLIE SITS ALONE IN A CHAIR
SOMEWHERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HER SHOES OFF, HER FEET CURLED
UNDER HER. SHE LOOKS LONELY AND TIRED AND AFRAID. AND SHE
CLEARLY BELIEVES SHE IS ALONE. BECAUSE SHE'S SHOVING HALF A
CANDY BAR INTO HER MOUTH.

-FITZ SITS AT HIS DESK IN THE OVAL. HANDS CLASPED UNDER HIS

OLIVIA
Why did you try to have me killed?
ROWAN
I didn't try to have you killed. I
tried to have Jake Ballard killed.
OLIVIA
(sarcastic)
Oh. Well. Fine.

What did you do to him?

Is he alive?

ROWAN
That's not the question you should
be asking. The question you should
be asking is, are you?
As Liv takes this in, the car turns and Rowan looks up.
We're here.

OLIVIA
I don't need your helpROWAN
Now you listen to me. You raised
your skirt and you opened your knees
and you gave it away to a man with
too much power. You are not special.
You are not rare. Your story is no
different from a thousand other
stories in this town. So you know
how this goes. You know the drill.
You can call this in your sleep.
Hell, you wrote the White House
playbook for them. First, they'll
smile, be warm, sympathetic, on your
side, letting you know they will
fight for you. They'll lull you
into a false sense of security. And
then once your belly's exposed, they
will turn on you, disown you, drag
your name through the mud. They'll
make you a scapegoat for every awful
thing they've ever done. They will
gut you and everyone you know. And
they will be swift about it. By the
time you realize you should be
fighting back...well, you're already
bleeding to death. It's the
Presidency versus you. Whose victory
do you think they will fight for?
Whose body do you think they will

You will never be alone with him

who work for you. Do you understand

Olivia stares at him, stricken. And for just a beat, Rowan

abusive.

Secretary of State! First Lady...Do
you have to be so mediocre?!
And right before our eyes, Olivia Pope seems to get smaller,
lesser, muted. It's awful.
Rowan pulls it together. Breathes. Awkwardly pats her as
if to soften that exchange. He's not the best dad in the
world but he is her dad.
ROWAN (CONT'D)
Your staff will be taken care of
financially. Your business will
continue to run. Money is not a
problem. There is always money.
Money bought that plane. Money bought
the silence of the gentlemen flying
the plane. On board you'll find an
envelope. It contains a passport, a
Swiss bank book, a go file, an
entirely new identity. There's a
very nice island waiting for you at
the end of the flight. You'll stay
there for 8 months. And then I can
arrange a place for you in Brussels.
Or Thailand if you prefer.
Johannesburg. Anywhere but here,

Rowan's voice is calm, measured and very, very dangerous.

CYRUS on the march, trailed by twenty-something ETHAN, an
ambitious junior policy aide; and thirty-something JEANNINE,
a pretty and sharp Communications staffer.
ETHAN
Should we cancel the briefing, sir?
CYRUS
Canceling the press briefing would
show weakness. We are not weak. We
are busy. We are handling the business
of the country. And the country is
full of subjects other than the
identity of the President's supposed
mistress. Right, Jeannine?
JEANNINE

Girl Scouts in Oklahoma.

No one can say they don't care about
dead Girl Scouts. You care about
dead Girl Scouts, don't you Ethan?
Cyrus fixes him with a death glare.
Yes, I do.

CYRUS
Then it's settled, Jeannine will bat
away the mistress questions and pivot
to the dead Girl Scouts.

She could care less. She holds the envelope her father left

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We'll be taking off in a moment.
Can I get you anything to drink?

No, thank you.

The attacks on this White House by
the liberal media are an abomination.
It's an attack on the party, on
family, on women, on race. It's a
lie. It is a lie, Sally. I cannot
emphasize that enough.

Fitz is barely paying attention. Sally is paying too much
attention. Mara is just VERY uncomfortable having this
conversation in front of the President. She keeps sneaking
nervous glances at him.

he went down to the Oval Office to

he ran into you. I'm guessing that

The upsetting thing about being as

profoundly boring. What did you
call me? Ornamental. Not functional.
I am a rose dying on the vine here.
Give me a war to run or the CIA or
something. But I use the copious
amounts of free time I have to think.
And I have been thinking. Who could
have possibly leaked that name? And
why? And then I realized who would
benefit the most. My idealistic,
romantic, optimistic, idiotic,
husband. You thought if you leaked
Olivia's name and then I stood next
to you and held your hand and smiled
as you told the press what you did,
it would neutralize the whole
situation. What did you say in the
bunker? Stop looking for a way out
and look for a way through? You get
me to play the good wife, control me
and by extension the nation? Because,
and here's the best part: You still
somehow believe that the country
will eventually embrace the idea of
you bringing your whore into the
White House as First Lady. And step
one? Leaking Liv's name.
And Fitz is moving in to Mellie, faster and darker than we've
seen him in a while. Tougher. Also hotter and sexier

(Note: Scripted dialogue from Scene 10 is in BOLD)
We're on a TV screen. News anchor TANNER SHAW, interviews
VANESSA CHANDLER, an attractive young society reporter with
more game than her fancy outfit suggests.
TANNER SHAW
Joining us now, the reporter who
broke this story -- Vanessa Chandler
of the Post's Styles section...
Vanessa -- we have a name now. Former
White House Communications Director
Olivia Pope. How sure are you that
she's the woman who had an alleged
affair with President Grant?
VANESSA CHANDLER
It's just one source but it's a good
source. A source in a position to
know the true identity of the
President's mistress. And, well...you
know how this works. It's just a
matter of time before others come
out of the woodwork and more details
emerge.
TANNER SHAW
Can you give us an idea of how high
up this person is in the
administration?
VANESSA CHANDLER
No. They came to me in confidence
at great personal and professional
risk. But, I will say that my source
is one hundred percent positive Ms.
Pope is the President's mistress and
if they are right -- and obviously I
believe they are -- there will be a
lot to report really soon. When
that happens, Tanner, you will find
out about it like everyone else, by
reading my blog in the Styles section
of the Post's website.

story and we have not heard any
comment from the White House.
VANESSA CHANDLER
I think the silence says it all.
Look, we're not talking about some
doe-eyed intern here. As you said,
she was President Grant's
Communications Director. Before
that she was one of his closest
advisors on the campaign. This is a
woman who directly influenced policy.
If she attained that level of power
while she was sleeping with the
President, it could be very bad for
the administration. The White House
obviously has to plan their next
move very carefully. With every
moment that goes by without the White
House addressing it, I become more
confident that I'm right on this.
TANNER SHAW
Let's talk about Olivia Pope. Other
than her work at the White House,
what do we know about her?
VANESSA CHANDLER
In a word, she's fabulous. She's
stylish, beautiful and extremely
capable. I've been in this town a
long time and I know more than my
fair share of power players who owe
their entire careers -- in some cases
even their lives -- to the services
of Olivia PopeTANNER SHAW

sources at the same time denying
that Olivia Pope had any form of
inappropriate relationship with the
President. And promising a live
statement from the President sometime
today. Although the sources would
not elaborate on the content of the
President's statement, it will likely
be an admission of guilt and official
confirmation that Jeannine Locke is
indeed the woman the First Lady was
referring to when she went on live
television and revealed to me that
President Grant had been unfaithful.
After that interview, the President
stated in no uncertain terms that
his personal life was none of our
business. But, in light of these
new developments, it looks like
President Grant has realized he has
no choice but to address the nation,
a nation which is today demanding
answers.
