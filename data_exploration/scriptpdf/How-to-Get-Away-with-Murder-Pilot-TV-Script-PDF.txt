EXT. MAIN QUAD, MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

1

FOOTBALL PLAYERS. CHEERLEADERS. A SEA OF SCREAMING, RILED UP
COLLEGE STUDENTS...because we've been thrust into the center of a
PEP RALLY for the MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY WARRIORS. By day, this
quad is filled with the best and brightest minds in the country -future Rhodes Scholars and Nobel winners -- but right now? They're
just drunk. Spooky, foreboding music sets the tone as we MOVE
SLOW MOTION over the crowd. Even though it's the middle of winter,
the GUYS are SHIRTLESS, showing off their pecs painted in school
colors while their GIRLFRIENDS sit on their shoulders, chugging
from bottles of whiskey. It's a wild, rowdy, debaucherous ORGY
of school pride that only America's wealthiest children could get
away with. The only person who could possibly get them to pay
attention right now is the FOOTBALL COACH shouting into a mic on
the stage, a preacher with his disciples. He holds a TORCH.
FOOTBALL COACH
It's been a rough year, no doubt,
but that all ends Saturday! Because
that's when this team, my Warriors,
are gonna burn those lazy, cocky,
pansy-ass Princeton players to the
ground! AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
MIDDLETON?!! LET ME HEAR IT!!
As the crowd ROARS, the coach now brings the torch to a TOWERING
WOODEN EFFIGY behind him, the word "Princeton" painted across its
make-believe jersey. And as the effigy BURSTS INTO FLAMES and
the MARCHING BAND LAUNCHES INTO SONG, the camera suddenly speeds
up, pushing through the students and over the bonfire and past
the gothic buildings and ivy-covered arches that make up this
beautiful campus until we CRASH INTO -2

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
It's dark and eerie as we whip past the trees, deeper and deeper
into the woods, the sounds of the pep rally fading behind us.
Suddenly the camera SCREECHES TO A HALT. We are now in a small
CLEARING. Through the dark we see 3 TWENTY-SOMETHINGS, a diverse
motley crew, shivering in the cold and freaking out. About what,
we'll soon discover. The first of them, MICHAELA PRATT (27,
preppy, type-A) paces and thinks as the two others sit, quiet and
trembling. She was born knowing how to "lean in" so that's what
she's going to do right now -- take control, CEO this shit.
MICHAELA
It's been too long. We did what we
said, we waited, we stuck to our
word, but we can't just sit here all
night. We have to do something.
And I know you're not going to like
it, but I'm calling Aiden.

2.
PATRICK
ARE YOU HIGH??!
Under normal circumstances, PATRICK DONAHUE (25) is sexy,
sophisticated, confident, cool, and hyper-articulate. Right now
though? He's shitting his pants.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
We're not calling your fiancé! We
wait. THAT is what we decided so
THAT is what we're going to do.
MICHAELA
I was never part of that decision.
PATRICK
Because you had a meltdown! You
could barely make a sentence! So
shut up, sit down, and stop acting
like a little bitch baby.
MICHAELA
I am acting like a person does in a
situation like this!
PATRICK
No. You're hysterical and you need
to calm the hell down.
MICHAELA
DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT
NOW!
Hey.

WES (O.S.)

They all jump, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER, just like we do at home,
because now a 4th person stands there. Meet WES GIBBINS (27).
Wes is boyish, easy-going, instantly likable...and his t-shirt is
covered in blood.
WES (CONT'D)
Sorry it took me so long.
back for this.

I went

Wes removes a backpack, pulls out a TROPHY, also covered in blood.
MICHAELA
Wes! Why'd you bring that here?
Take it back right now.
No.

LAUREL
It's smart.

Finally we hear from LAUREL WILDING (23, bookish, introverted).
She's been quiet up till now.

3.
That's her thing -- she's a thinker, an observer, the type of person
easy to underestimate. She has the answer now though, decisive,
confident.
LAUREL (CONT'D)
The People vs. Gallivan! Pennsylvania
vs. Gottlieb! Cases the prosecution
should've won but lost because there
was no murder weapon...
PATRICK
So what are you saying?
LAUREL
We clean it and put it back.
it in plain sight.
(beat)
After we bury the body.
A long beat as everyone takes that in.

Hide

Then --

MICHAELA
No, absolutely NOT.
PATRICK
I agree with Michaela.
Patrick--

LAUREL

PATRICK
The trophy we need, yes.
body stays where it is.

But the

LAUREL
The body is what gets us caught.
PATRICK
Then why'd we leave it there in the
first place?
LAUREL
Because we panicked. All of us.
But now that we're finally thinking
straight-MICHAELA
You are not thinking straight-LAUREL
Then what do you suggest??!
MICHAELA
Something that doesn't involve
carrying a body across campus on the
busiest night of the year!

4.
PATRICK
She's right, Laurel. Even if we
were able to get it out of the house,
unseen, the ground is frozen-LAUREL
We have all night to dig!
PATRICK
You don't know what you're talking
about!
LAUREL
This is murder, none of us know what
we're talking about!
MICHAELA
Please, just yell that a little louder-Hey...

WES

MICHAELA
Honestly, you're all dumber than I
thought if you think we should go
back there.
PATRICK
I'm agreeing with you!
Now everyone's yelling, except Wes who keeps trying to interrupt.
MICHAELA/PATRICK/LAUREL/WES
You should've agreed with me weeks
ago when I begged, BEGGED, to tell
the police instead of deluding
ourselves that we were on the right
side of this!/And I'm sorry Laurel
but someone will sniff out the body
if we bury it, if they don't catch
us before, there are cops everywhere
tonight!/You two need to MAN UP and
THINK because we're going to jail
unless we go back there and destroy
the DNA!/Guys...Listen...Hey...SHUT
UP!
Finally they all stop, look at Wes. He's calm, focused, a quiet
and confident leader to this very outspoken group.
WES
It's two against two. We have no
other choice. We flip a coin.
Beat.

5.
MICHAELA/PATRICK/LAUREL
That is the dumbest thing you've
ever said. /I'm not letting a
freaking coin decide this. /We're
adults, we can figure this out...
WES
We don't have time to fight! We
need to make a decision and commit
to it. So if someone has a better
idea, say it now!
They all realize, no one does.

Wes pulls a coin out of his pocket.

WES (CONT'D)
Heads we get the body. Tails we
leave it where it is. Okay?
A beat, then they all nod. Okay. And as Wes tosses the coin in
the air, the four of them watching and freezing and totally totally
fucked, we HOLD TIGHT ON WES AND CUT TO:
3

EXT. MAIN QUAD, MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER

3

Wes, the September sun on his face, now rides his bike through
Middleton's pristine, manicured campus. A CHYRON appears: FOUR
MONTHS EARLIER. He weaves his way past the fresh-faced,
Abercrombie-clad undergrads playing frisbee on the green and
professors holding class under trees. And just as we find
ourselves remembering our own college days and wishing we could
go back, and to this idyllic campus in particular, Wes stops his
bike in front of a beautiful, historic building. He looks up at
the letters etched into the stone: "MIDDLETON LAW SCHOOL." Wes
takes in the sight, his face full of so much hope and promise,
that he doesn't notice the BULLETIN BOARD he passes on his way
inside. Stapled across every inch of its surface is the same
FLIER -- it shows a PHOTO of missing student LILA STANGARD (21,
all-American) printed with the words, "Have you seen me?" As we
HOLD ON this eerie, haunting image, a mystery about to unfold...
4

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
Wes enters through the back of this old-fashioned lecture hall
filled with 80 OF THE MOST BRILLIANT LAW STUDENTS IN AMERICA. As
he makes his way to the front of the room, smiling at people, way
too friendly, we hear snippets of different conversations, but
all of them about the same exact person.
NERVOUS GIRL
I threw up four times this morning
worried she's gonna call on me...
DOUCHEFACE
She's a ballbuster, sure, but I spent
my summer interning for Justice
(MORE)

4

6.
DOUCHEFACE (CONT'D)
Roberts. I know how to handle a big
personality...
NERDY INTELLECTUAL
Dershowitz has the upper hand in the
academic world but I think DeWitt's
clearly the better defense attorney...
Wes reaches the front row, taking a seat next to a person we do
not yet see. He takes a deep breath.
WES
Here we go. I'm not usually a first
row kinda guy but I promised myself
I wouldn't hide in the back of the
class on the first day-I'm engaged.

MICHAELA

And now we REVEAL MICHAELA in the next seat. She wears a tasteful
sweater set and a GIANT DIAMOND RING, which she now holds out for
Wes to see. He realizes what she's thinking...
WES
Oh. Oh no. I wasn't hitting on...
That's not... You're attractive,
yes, but-MICHAELA
Seats are assigned. There's a chart
over there.
Michaela goes back to meticulously high-lighting her already tabbed
TEXTBOOK. Wes, now mortified, quickly hurries off, passing-PATRICK
Nice try, player.
Patrick's all suave and dapper in a tie, not a hair out of place.
No.

WES
I wasn't...

PATRICK
You should go find your seat. You
don't wanna be a sitting duck when
the Shooter gets here.
Who?

WES

7.
PATRICK
(amused)
Oh my god. You have no idea what
you just walked into.
But before Wes can ask what he means, the ROOM SUDDENLY GOES QUIET
as PROFESSOR ANNALISE DEWITT (40s) enters. Annalise is everything
you hope your law professor will be -- brilliant, passionate,
creative, charismatic. She's also everything you don't expect -sexy, elegant, glamorous, dangerous. Without a word or wasted
motion, a shark through water, she moves to the front of the room.
ANNALISE
Good morning. I don't know what
terrible things you've all done up
to this point in your lives but
clearly your karma's out of balance
to get assigned to my class. That
said, here we all are. I'm Professor
Annalise DeWitt and this is Criminal
Law 100. Or, as I prefer to call it -She picks up a RED MARKER and writes on the board, the students
all watching, twisting their necks to see the words. Finally she
finishes, turning to them as she reads the words aloud...
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
How to get away with murder.
And as the students sit forward in their seats, some amused, some
scared, but all of them THRILLED beyond belief, we HOLD ON the
words she's written on the board. Which is also our:
TITLE CARD
5

INT. LECTURE HALL - MOMENTS LATER
Annalise jumps into her lecture, commanding the room, Patton before
his troops.
ANNALISE
Many of you brought your textbook.
Don't bother. Not because you won't
be tested on its content -- you will -but because that's material you'll
need to learn on your own time.
Because this lecture? Is my time.
And unlike many of my colleagues, I
will NOT be teaching you how to study
the law or theorize about it, but
rather, how to practice it. In a
courtroom. Like a real lawyer.
(beat)
Now, to our first case study, a past
client of mine known as the Aspirin
Assassin.

5

8.
Everyone takes out a copy of a CASE STUDY PACKET. Everyone except
Wes, who's just looking around, lost, no idea what's going on.
But before he can ask anyone for help, Annalise starts a powerpoint, a PHOTO of GINA SADOWSKI (30s, peroxide blonde, trashy
sexy) now popping up on the screen.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Tell us the facts of the case...
Annalise looks to her seating chart, everyone shifting nervously,
before she comes upon a name.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Patrick Donahue.
Patrick stands -- effortless and confident.
PATRICK
The People vs. Gina Sadowski was a
case of attempted murder. The
defendant, Ms. Sadowski, worked as
the Second Assistant to the victim,
Arthur Levinson, who was the CEO of
an advertising agency.
Annalise changes the slide, a PHOTO of ARTHUR LEVINSON (50s,
distinguished) popping up. [Note: New slides will appear
throughout this scene as we introduce new information -- photos
of people they're discussing, evidence, etc.]
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Ms. Sadowski was not only Mr.
Levinson's assistant though. She
was also his mistress.
ANNALISE
What happened after Mr. Levinson's
wife of 27 years, Agnes, discovered
the affair...
(seating chart)
Asher Millstone?
DOUCHEFACE (20s, pompous, uber-prepared) stands.
DOUCHEFACE
Mr. Levinson ended the relationship
with the defendant and transferred
her to the accounting department.
But on her last day working for him,
she allegedly swapped one of his
blood pressure pills for an aspirin -which she knew he was allergic to.
ANNALISE
What occurred when Mr. Levinson
ingested the aspirin? Anyone...?

9.
HANDS SHOOT UP but Michaela beats them all by simply standing.
MICHAELA
Mr. Levinson went into anaphylactic
shock. His throat swelled and his
brain was deprived of oxygen for the
7 minutes it took his First Assistant
to find him.
(then)
Michaela Pratt.
Michaela smiles and sits -- that's how it's done, bitches. And
throughout all of this Wes is looking around, sweating, shocked
that his classmates are able to answer these questions...
ANNALISE
We've established the actus reus,
but what was the mens rea? Wesley
Gibbins?
Wes winces.

Fuck.

He stands.

Nervous.

WES
The mens rea. Right.

Um...

Wes opens his textbook, starts to flip through it...
ANNALISE
Day 1 and you're unprepared?
WES
No. Well, yes, but... I didn't
know there was anything to prepare.
ANNALISE
I emailed this assignment to the
entire class two days ago.
Oh.
A beat.

WES
That's why.

I didn't get that.

Annalise taking in the sight of him.

Hungry.

ANNALISE
Mr. Gibbins, as a defense attorney I
spend most of my time around
professional liars so you're going
to have to work a little harder to
pull one over on me.
WES
I'm not...it's just...
(biting the bullet)
I only got accepted here two days
ago. From the waitlist. So that's
probably why you didn't get my email.

10.
Some uncomfortable chuckles, Doucheface in particular getting a
kick. We feel terrible for Wes, but Annalise presses on.
ANNALISE
Let me help you out. Actus reus
means "guilty act" -- the poisoning
of Mr. Levinson with an aspirin in
this case -- whereas mens rea means
"guilty mind." So what do you think
was Ms. Sadowski's mens rea?
Wes just stares at her.

No clue what she just said.

ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Think, Mr. Gibbins. This is nothing
more than common sense.
But Wes can't think, his mind now only focused on the fact that
everyone is staring at him and his utter, horrifying embarrassment
when suddenly we hear...
To kill.

LAUREL (O.S.)

Annalise stops, turning to the class.
ANNALISE
Will the individual who just spoke
please stand and repeat their answer?
Out of the abyss of students, a hidden, unnoticed LAUREL rises.
She is meek, tentative, shy...different than the decisive,
argumentative girl we met in the woods.
LAUREL
The mens rea, also referred to as
"intent," was to kill Mr. Levinson.
She didn't of course, which is why
this was an attempted murder case
and not first degree murder.
ANNALISE
That's right. Your name?
LAUREL
Laurel Wilding.
And just like a switch was flipped, from to zero to pissed-ANNALISE
Don't ever take a learning opportunity
away from another student, Ms.
Wilding. No matter how smart we
need everyone to think we are.
Ouch.

Laurel sits, mortified, as Annalise continues.

11.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Now who can tell me what verdict the
jury came to on the case?
A beat as everyone starts to flip through the packets...
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
None of you know. Which makes sense.
Because I lied. This is not a past
case but one I go to trial on in two
days. That's right. Gina is my
client. And now your client too.
Off the students' stunned, excited faces, we CUT TO:
6

EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - DAY

6

We're outside a quaint, two-story Victorian right on the edge of
campus. A WOODEN SIGN sits out front -- "THE LAW OFFICE OF
ANNALISE DEWITT, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY." And now as we get
closer we see that STUDENTS pour out the door...
GINA (PRE-LAP)
Every day before lunch it was the
same thing.
7

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE ON GINA SADOWSKI, now telling her story, her nervous voice
shaking through her thick Philly accent...
GINA
I had to put a blood pressure pill
on the plate next to his keyboard so
he'd remember to take it.
We now REVERSE ANGLE to see ALL THE STUDENTS gathered in the packed
living room -- people on the floor, pushed against the wall,
overflowing into the foyer. Wes watches, on the edge of his seat.
GINA (CONT'D)
And this one day, I had been working
there a few weeks at that point, I
walked into his office to put the
pill there when I screamed. Because
Arthur was there. Back early from
his lunch meeting. And when I say
screamed, I mean, it was something
out of a horror movie. I was like,
crap, he's gonna fire me -- Arthur
was a real ball busta' to work for -but instead he just started laughin'.
So then I started laughin'.
(MORE)

7

12.
GINA (CONT'D)
That real, hard hurts-your-belly
kind and...well I guess I really saw
him then. As a man and not some big
ad exec jerk. And then, well, he
kissed me and...yeah, I became that
girl.
As Gina looks down, embarrassed, Doucheface whispers to Laurel.
DOUCHEFACE
Something tells me she's always been
"that girl."
Laurel just glares at him, offended, as Gina continues.
GINA
We went on like that for a few months
until this one day when Agnes, his
wife, she came in the office. I
could tell the minute she met me -she knew. I wasn't surprised when
he told me he was moving me to
accounting. They have kids and I
was just some bimbo secretary. I
told myself to just be happy they
weren't firing me. It was on my
last day working for him when I was
coming back from lunch and saw the
ambulance outside the building.
When I heard why they were there,
that Arthur was hurt...
(tearing up, emotional)
I loved him. I know that's hard to
believe but... I loved him, why in
the hell would I want to hurt him??
And now Gina's all tears. As are many of the students, moved by
her story. Annalise puts a comforting hand on Gina.
ANNALISE
It's okay if you need a little break.
Gina nods and heads to the bathroom.

Once she's gone...

ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Gina only became my client 2 days
ago. You haven't heard of her case
yet because her previous lawyer was
bad and had no clue had how to work
the media. Which brings me to the
question you're all asking yourselves.
"Why are you here?" One, because
the dean doesn't like me using
university space for my private work.
(MORE)

13.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
And two, because your first assignment
is to help me win this trial.
As the students take this in, confused, excited, scared...
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Tomorrow, each of you will have one
minute to present what you believe
is the best defense for Gina. I
have my own strategy of course, but
see if you can beat my approach,
come up with something better. -Mr. Gibbins?

Yes?

WES
(startling)

ANNALISE
A serious student would've checked
with me about any prep-work, no matter
the timing of their acceptance, so
you'll go last -- an unenviable
position since no two students will
be able to present the same idea.
As Wes takes this in, totally fucked...
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Use the resources in this office -Gina's discovery file, my library,
the people who understand me even
better than myself -- my associates
Bonnie and Frank. Guys...?
From the back of the room, we spot FRANK DELGADO (38) and BONNIE
WINTERBOTTOM (40s). Frank is a macho, takes-no-shit type of guy -a local Philly boy done good -- while Bonnie is his perfect
counterpoint -- a mama bear type, warm and sweet and smiley.
FRANK
Name's Frank and unlike every teacher
you've had, I do believe there are
stupid questions. So if you got
'em, please see my lovely colleague
Bonnie.
BONNIE
Or, better, come to us with answers.
We'll like you much better that way.
As the students stand, gathering their things--

14.
ANNALISE
One more thing. Every year I choose
4 students to come work at the firm.
I'll be using this assignment to
decide who that will be. And the
top student? Gets this.
Annalise pulls a TROPHY off the bookshelf, the trophy we recognize
from that first scene in the woods.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Consider it your immunity idol.
Whoever wins it can turn it back in
at any point to get out of an
assignment or exam. Now get to work.
And as the students all jump into action-8

INT. WES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

8

Wes works alone in this rundown, off campus apartment. An air
mattress sits on the floor, unpacked boxes piled everywhere. He
paces, talking to himself, as he reads from Gina's DISCOVERY FILE.
WES
The First Assistant saw Gina with an
aspirin that morning. Forensics
found aspirin residue on the plate.
She was warned about his allergy the
first day on the job, which means we
should argue...we should argue...we
should argue...that she's guilty.
He collapses on the bed, fucked, no ideas. But suddenly he
squints, noticing something. He sits up, peering closer at -- a
SERIES OF SCRATCH-MARKS etched into the wall. Scratch marks that
look a lot like a crazy person took their fingernails to it. And
as he sits there, staring at this creepy, strange image...
MUSIC BLARES through the wall - hip hop or something with lots of
bass and anger. As he stares at the vibrating wall, HARD CUT TO:
9

INT. HALLWAY, WES'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Wes POUNDS on the neighbor's door. Finally it opens a crack,
revealing REBECCA (22, edgy, pierced). We only get a glimpse but
can immediately see that there's a haunted, vulnerable quality
about her. Wes shouts over the music.
WES
Hi! Wes! I just moved in next door-Are you okay?
He stops, because he now sees that she's been crying, her eyes
red and puffy.

9

15.
REBECCA
What do you want.
She's short, impatient.

So much for a neighborly welcome.

WES
Your music! I normally wouldn't ask
to turn it down but today was my
first day of law school and I have
this big assignment -No.
What?

REBECCA
WES

REBECCA
The last guy who lived in your place
was a law student. I put up with
his crazy loud rabbit sex and nervous
breakdown, you can deal with this.
She shuts the door in his face. And then turns the music even
LOUDER. As Wes stands there, hating his new life...
10

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
Bonnie and Frank work on Gina's case -- piles of papers and Chinese
take-out spread across the Persian Rug on the floor. But right
now their attention is on the LIVE NEWS CONFERENCE playing on TV.
Outside a police station, a very emotional STUART & MIRANDA
STANGARD (50s) speak to a bank of reporters. Football hero LOGAN
O'REILLY (22, square-jawed, built like an ox) stands beside them,
holding a PHOTO of the MISSING GIRL FROM THE FLIERS, LILA. The
scroll reads "Missing Middleton girl's parents speak out."
STUART STANBURG (ON TV)
To the person or persons who have
taken our daughter, please, tell us
your demands. And to Lila, sweetie,
if you're watching, know we love
you. All of us - your mother and I,
your sisters, Logan-BONNIE
How have they not arrested that fiancé
yet? Look at him, he's a giant rage
ball of testosterone and steroids!
FRANK
He's the hopes and dreams of an entire
football season. No one's arresting
him unless they find her body in his
trunk.

10

16.
ANNALISE (O.S.)
Who wrote this opening statement?
They startle, a stern Annalise now standing there as she shuts
off the TV and throws some files down on the coffee table.
I did.

FRANK

ANNALISE
I hate it. Start over. Bonnie, no
more burying my desk in precedents.
We need to appeal to the jury's
emotions, not their brains.
(then)
We have 36 hours, I don't care if it
means staying here all night, we can
do better than what we have right
now.
They nod, good little schoolchildren, as Annalise leaves.
quickly dials his cell phone, Bonnie noticing...

Frank

BONNIE
The philosophy major?
FRANK
The gymnast. She's new.
(into phone)
Lacey, hey, I need to reschedule...
And as Frank steps out, he knocks a Chinese container over, food
now spilling all over the rug. And Bonnie.
Frank!

BONNIE

And as we HOLD ON the NOW STAINED RUG and FLASH FORWARD TO -11

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD
That same rug now being rolled up by Wes and Patrick. Because we
are now back to that night in the woods.
And although we don't
know who it is yet, we can tell there is now a BODY in the rug.
(Note: These flash-forward scenes will be shot in some cool,
grainy visual style different than the rest of our show.)
Michaela--

PATRICK

Michaela snaps from the other side of the room, her back to them.
MICHAELA
I never agreed to this!
(MORE)

11

17.
MICHAELA (CONT'D)
The coin did so I'm going to stand
here and not see anything so when
I'm called to testify, I can say
just that.
PATRICK
I understand, freak-show. I just
want you to move your feet.
Michaela realizes, she's standing on the rug. So she steps aside.
They finish rolling it up as a Laurel enters holding the now clean,
shiny trophy in a clear zip-lock bag. She hands it to Wes.
LAUREL
Here. I wiped the sink down with
bleach after I washed it.
WES
We'll put it back tomorrow, the cops
won't ever know it was the weapon.
PATRICK
Can we hurry up here?
Wes puts the trophy in his backpack (leaving us wondering who had
the trophy at the time of the murder), then goes to help Patrick
lift the rug...which is too fucking heavy. Laurel jumps in.
Let me...

LAUREL

Still, the 3 of them aren't strong enough.
Fine.

They look to Michaela.

MICHAELA

And now the four of them lift the rug off the floor, struggling
to carry it into the foyer, bumping into crap as they go. Finally
they reach the wooden front door. Wes turns to them. They all
nod -- do it. So Wes now opens the door to REVEAL -A CAMPUS COP standing next to a double-parked SUV, its hazard
lights flashing. The cop looks up at them, all friendly.
CAMPUS COP
This car one of yours?
And as they all stand there, absolutely fucked, we -END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
12

EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD
Where we left off, the Cop waiting for an answer.

A long beat--

PATRICK
It's my car, sir.
CAMPUS COP
You're double parked. You might get
a ticket with all the city cops out
tonight.
(phew)
Oh. Right.

PATRICK
I'll move it now.

But before Patrick can, the Cop stops, now noticing the rug they've
now lowered to the ground and stepped in front of. Huh.
CAMPUS COP
This is that law professor's office?
A beat, each of them hoping the other will do the talking until -MICHAELA
Yes. Professor DeWitt. We're her
law students, but she's out of town
and she told us to take this old rug
to the bonfire.
CAMPUS COP
She asked you to go into her house
and burn a rug for her?
MICHAELA
It sounds weird, I know. Why don't
I get her on the phone for you so
she can explain?
Michaela digs out her phone as Laurel steps forward, glaring -what the fuck does she think she's doing?
LAUREL
It's a little late to call her, don't
you think?
MICHAELA
The nice officer here thinks we're
burgling our professor's house, let's
just clear this up.
(then, to the cop)
I mean, unless you'd rather me not?

MICHAELA (CONT'D)
She had to go to this funeral today,
her mother's funeral, but she's
probably not asleep yet. Hopefully...
It's fine.

CAMPUS COP
Just--

DRUNK DUDE (O.S.)
Hey you guys!!
Down the street, a DRUNK COLLEGE STUDENT carries a GIANT REINDEER
LAWN ORNAMENT as he runs to catch up to some friends.
DRUNK DUDE (CONT'D)
This'll burn good!
CAMPUS COP
God dammit.
(then, to our students)
Be safe, okay? There are ton of
crazies out tonight.
The Cop rushes to regulate on the drunk kids.
Michaela, impressed.

Patrick turns to

PATRICK
Where the hell has that girl been
all night?
MICHAELA
Can we just get this over with?
And now Michaela goes to pick up the rug, straining to lift it as
we HOLD ON HER DETERMINED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO -13

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER

13

Michaela, 4 months earlier, articulate and poised as she presents
her defense strategy for Gina before the class. Annalise, Frank,
and Bonnie are there taking notes as our students -- including
Wes, Laurel, and Patrick, watch with jealous rage.
MICHAELA
We should offer the jury another
suspect altogether -- Mr. Levinson's
wife, Agnes. She was angry about
the affair, had access to his office,
and knew what aspirin would look
like his blood pressure pill. So
what better way to get revenge than
to kill your cheating husband and
pin it on his mistress? Thank you.
Michaela stops, proud and confident, just as an EGG TIMER GOES OFF -right on time.

20.
Annalise, Bonnie and Frank whisper to each other for a moment before
Annalise turns back to Michaela.
ANNALISE
Take a seat, Ms. Pratt.
it to the next round.

You've made

Michaela beams, then sits. Wes crosses "Pin it on someone else"
off his list of POSSIBLE DEFENSE STRATEGIES.
Who's next?

ANNALISE (CONT'D)

And as all the HANDS SHOOT UP we BEGIN A SEQUENCE of the students
presenting their ideas, INTERCUTTING between them in a fast,
stylized, energetic way. First up, a casual-yet-self-assured-PATRICK
Yes, Gina put the aspirin on the
plate on his desk, but did she have
the intent to kill? Or was her intent
to simply harm Mr. Levinson?
ENGLISH ACCENT GIRL speaks fast and furious-ENGLISH ACCENT GIRL
Gina didn't realize it was an aspirin
but actually thought it was the blood
pressure medication which thus makes
Mr. Levinson's near death an accident
so therefore there was no mens rea...
Doucheface talks like he's Perry Mason in front of the jury.
DOUCHEFACE
It all comes down to a simple piece
of evidence -- the fact that doctors
ran Mr. Levinson's bloodwork too
late to show aspirin in his blood...
Laurel presents a graph.
LAUREL
A statistical breakdown of the jury
pool shows 80 percent of them come
from a low socioeconomic class...
PATRICK
Gina knew her boss was allergic to
aspirin but she did not know he could
die from it. She simply wanted to
give him a scare...
NERVOUS, STUTTERING STUDENT
So without a witness to assure that,
uh, sorry, I think I lost my spot...

21.
LAUREL
We use this inequality to our
advantage and present this case to
the jury as a class struggle...
MONOTONE, QUIET GUY
The issues at play are in need of
more extensive research so my
recommendation is to delay...
DOUCHEFACE
Yes, the doctor's on record saying
that he didn't run the bloodwork on
time but do we really trust him??!
NERVOUS STUDENT
I swear I'll find it. Just, one
more second...
PATRICK
Attempted murder, therefore, is a
bogus, inaccurate charge. The judge
will have no other choice but to
direct the jury to an N.G. verdict.
LAUREL
Gina is one of them -- the put upon
and under-appreciated -- while Mr.
Levinson represents the wealthy and
out of touch. Thank you.
Laurel stops, waits for her fate.
You can sit.

ANNALISE

As Laurel sits, relieved, we now see that most seats are empty -the majority of students disqualified now at the front of the
class, sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall. Only about
20 students remain, including Patrick, Michaela, Laurel, English
Accent Girl, Doucheface, and Wes -- who is now looking down at
his LIST OF STRATEGIES, every single idea crossed out.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
And now our last victim. Mr. Gibbins?
Wes takes a deep breath, then stands.

Annalise presses the timer.

WES
So, um, the way I see it is...well...
There's really only one option.
(then, out of nowhere)
We say it was self defense.
(MORE)

22.
WES (CONT'D)
(some chuckles)
I know it's weird to enter a guilty
plea now, the day before the trial,
but it's my belief that, at the time
of the crime, Gina was suffering
from...Stockholm Syndrome.
(more laughs)
Which is actually quite common in
assistants with demanding bosses.
The affair, for example, is just one
example of how far Mr. Levinson's
brainwashing of Gina went -- he made
her fall in love with him. So in
this way, her poisoning him was
actually just an act of self defense.
And I'll just go stand over there...
Wes goes to join the disqualified students when -No.

Sit.

ANNALISE

As we hold on the class's utter shock, Wes included -ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Congratulations to all of you still
seated. You'll be joining us for
the next round in court tomorrow.
That said, not one of you presented
an idea I can use in court so my
plan wins. Step 1...
(writing on the board)
We discredit the witnesses. Find
the holes in their stories, attack
their character. Step 2, we introduce
a new suspect. That person is not
Mr. Levinson's wife, Ms. Pratt, but
rather his business partner, Lionel
Brandt. Step 3, we bury the evidence
by throwing so much information at
the jury they'll walk into the
deliberation room with one
overwhelming feeling -- doubt.
(recapping)
Destroy witnesses. Find a new
suspect. Overwhelm the jury. That
is how you get away with murder.
Or, in this case, attempted murder.
Meet me at the courthouse at 9
tomorrow to present your ideas that'll
work with this strategy.
As Annalise starts to go, Michaela stands.

23.
MICHAELA
Professor DeWitt! We have torts at
9 tomorrow, then contracts, property-ANNALISE
You're free to drop out of the
competition at any point, Ms. Pratt.
MICHAELA
No, it's not that, I just wasn't
sure how we were supposed to-ANNALISE
(interrupting, fierce)
The way you're whining to me right
now, it feels like you think I'm
your mother. I'm not. Show up
tomorrow or don't. It's that simple.
Annalise struts off, Bonnie and Frank following. As we go off a
bitch-slapped Michaela, her classmates all gleefully watching...
14

EXT. PHILADELPHIA COURTHOUSE - DAY

14

Philly's criminal courthouse.
LINDA WHEELER (PRE-LAP)
So I just kept pumping his chest...
15

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Annalise, Frank, Bonnie, and Gina sit at the defense table as
PROSECUTOR HANK BALDWIN (50s, by the book) questions witness LINDA
WHEELER (50s, cat lady type). Linda's tearful as she recounts
the events of that day. We also notice she wears THICK, COKEBOTTLE GLASSES. JUDGE KATHY POWELL (50s) presides.
LINDA WHEELER
Just like in our company CPR class.
But it didn't work. He wasn't
breathing and his skin...well it
just kept getting more blue and-(crying harder)
I'm so sorry Agnes, I tried everything
I could think of...
She's talking to AGNES LEVINSON (50s), wife of ARTHUR LEVINSON,
both of whom we now see sitting behind the prosecution. Agnes
nods a sweet thank you to Linda while Arthur does nothing at all.
Because now we see -- Arthur is in a wheelchair, his mental
faculties not all there as a NURSE monitors his breathing machine.
On the other side of the courtroom, we find our 20 STUDENTS (except
Michaela). Patrick mutters to Wes.
PATRICK
And we just lost the case.

15

24.
Back to the stand, the prosecutor feigns sympathy.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
You did everything you could've,
Miss Wheeler.
He sits. Now Annalise stands, walks to Linda. A shark to blood.
Watching her in action is riveting, thrilling...
ANNALISE
You don't like my client, do you
Miss Wheeler?
What?

LINDA WHEELER

ANNALISE
Sometimes you'd yell at her, throw
things, call her...
(reading from a list)
"Incompetent," "stupid," "trailer
trash?"
And now the jury looks to Gina sympathetically.
LINDA WHEELER
No. That's... I mean, working for
someone as important as Mr. Levinson
can be stressful. Tempers flare...
ANNALISE
So you're admitting you have a temper?
As Annalise continues her attack, Michaela now rushes in, out of
breath as she runs up to the defense table, whispering loudly to
Bonnie and Frank so that everyone in the courtroom is now
distracted. Wes, Patrick, and Laurel watch, confused...
PATRICK
What is she doing?
ANNALISE
Your honor, can I have a moment?
(to Michaela, pissed)
What the hell...?
FRANK
(to Michaela)
It's all you, girlfriend.
As Michaela is about to explain, we cut back to our students.
PATRICK
She's lost it, right? The first of
us to have a nervous breakdown?

25.
WES
I was sure it'd be me.
LAUREL
It still might be. Look...
They sees what she means, Annalise now looking at Michaela with
interest. Back to them -ANNALISE
How sure are you?
MICHAELA
90 percent.
(off Annalise's stare)
95.
As Annalise looks at her, wondering whether to trust her...
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor, I don't know what this
stalling is about but -ANNALISE
Sorry for the delay.
Michaela takes a seat next to Laurel, Patrick whispering to her
from the row behind.
PATRICK
What was that? Something you learned
in torts?
MICHAELA
Something that just won me the trophy.
As Patrick wonders what she means, Annalise continues her cross.
ANNALISE
Miss Wheeler, you testified that you
saw a pill on my client's desk the
day of the accident, correct?
Yes.

GINA

ANNALISE
You said it was a yellow pill, similar
to the color of Prosecutor Baldwin's
shirt perhaps?
Yes.

GINA

And now the entire room stops because Prosecutor Baldwin's shirt
is not yellow, but blue. Annalise steps closer to Miss Wheeler.

26.
ANNALISE
Mr. Baldwin's shirt is blue, Miss
Wheeler.
(then, softer)
Are you color blind?
As Linda shrinks in her seat...
Yes.

LINDA WHEELER

And now we hold on Michaela, who smiles victoriously, the other
students now clocking this, not sure how she knew this.
ANNALISE
I see. So whether the pill you saw
on my client's desk was blue, like
her similarly shaped anxiety
medication she took because of the
stress endured while working with
you, or yellow, like the aspirin
used to poison Mr. Levinson, is not
something you can tell us?
LINDA WHEELER
I told you, Gina was acting very
strange that morning. Nervous...
ANNALISE
It's a simple question, Miss Wheeler.
Is it possible the pill you saw on
Gina's desk was her anti-anxiety
medication?
LINDA WHEELER
...I guess so. Yes.
ANNALISE
Thank you for your candor.
A victorious Annalise sits at the table as Gina turns to Bonnie.
GINA
That was good, right?
No.

BONNIE
That was excellent.

Off a relieved, smiling Gina...
16

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
A gloating Michaela explains her discovery as Annalise, Frank,
Bonnie, and our 20 students listen. A jealous Patrick seethes.

16

27.
MICHAELA
I looked up her Facebook profile and
saw those crazy glasses, which got
me wondering about her eyesight, so
then I called every optometrist
covered under her insurance. When I
found hers, I pretended to be a claims
provider and got the receptionist to
tell me that Miss Wheeler has a
condition called achromatopsia. It
causes color blindness.
(then)
Step 1: Discredit the witness.
She stops, beaming, everyone hating her.

Annalise stands.

ANNALISE
I might as well give this to Ms.
Pratt right now.
Annalise picks up the trophy, Michaela's eyes now going wide like
a girl about to get a rose on The Bachelor.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
But I won't. Not until I see how
the rest of you step up your game.
As everyone jumps up, challenge accepted....
17

EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
As Wes catches up with a now furious Patrick-Patrick!

WES

PATRICK
That color blind crap was pure luck!
WES
At least there are 3 spots left.
PATRICK
Getting a spot isn't the point,
Waitlist.
It's not...?

WES

PATRICK
Winning is the point. Law Review,
Order of the Coif, a Supreme Court
appointment... It all starts with
that trophy. That's who DeWitt's
going to respect and mentor and make
into a king. That will be me.

17

28.
WES
Or me.
(off Patrick's scoff)
Whatever, I was just gonna ask -why don't we split up the prep-work
for tomorrow? Study group style...
PATRICK
(stopping them)
What's your LSAT score?
Oh come on.

WES

PATRICK
You're a waitlister which means you
probably got below a 170, right?
...165.

WES

PATRICK
(rushing off)
Gotta go.
Patrick!

WES

PATRICK
Not because I think you're a moron,
which I do, but because my plan
doesn't allow for a 3rd wheel. Later!
As Patrick runs off, Wes wondering what he's up to...
18

INT. WES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

18

The apartment's FILLED WITH LAW BOOKS, the walls covered with
PAPERS ABOUT GINA'S CASE. Wes stands there, reading, with TISSUES
STICKING OUT OF HIS EARS to block the sound of REBECCA'S MUSIC
BLARING FROM NEXT DOOR. We get QUICK SHOTS of him flipping through
books, drinking coffee, going over Gina's file, circling
phrases...when he suddenly stops. Digs up a paper. Cross
references it with a book. Holy shit. He's found something. He
jumps up, grabbing his bike and rushing out of his apartment...
19

EXT. MAIN QUAD, MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
Wes rides his bike through an arch and SCREECHES TO A HALT. Because
the ENTIRE QUAD'S LIT UP BY CANDLES, hundreds of students holding
a VIGIL for Lila. Fiancé Logan speaks to the crowd from a stage.
LOGAN
If Lila was here, I know she'd want
to thank everyone for their support.
(MORE)

19

29.
LOGAN (CONT'D)
She loves this place so much, just
like we all love her...
Logan chokes up, his teammates now all patting him on the back
and escorting him away. 3 SORORITY GIRLS approach the mic.
SORORITY GIRL
This is for Lila.
They start to SING. Something overwrought and funny like Demi
Lovato's Skyscraper. Wes watches the students sway and cry,
finding this all very strange, then pushes his way through them...
Excuse me.
20

WES
Sorry.

Excuse me...

EXT/INT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
A now breathless Wes dumps his bike on the lawn and runs to the
front door, which he finds ajar. He enters -- it's quiet, empty...
Hello?

WES

No answer. He moves into the house, looks in the study, living
room. No one home. But there -- he sees a light on in Annalise's
office, some voices and laughter inside. He walks over to the
office door, which is slightly open so he can see Annalise, her
back to him as she sits on the desk. Wes knocks.
WES (CONT'D)
Professor DeWitt-And the slight pressure of his knock now makes the door slide
open enough so Wes now can now see a NAKED MAN NOW POP UP FROM
BELOW THE DESK. Annalise jumps up, quickly pulling down her skirt.
Oh my god.

WES (CONT'D)

NAKED MAN
Get the hell out!
Wes turns, racing out of the office and back to the front door...
Hey!

Stop.

ANNALISE

Annalise, eerily calm, heads down the foyer, stopping him.
WES
I'm so sorry. The door was open and-ANNALISE
Oh my god, I'll kill him.

20

30.
A now annoyed Annalise heads over to a desk, dials the phone.
it rings, she looks to Wes, who really just wants to leave...

As

ANNALISE (CONT'D)
So why are you here?
Oh.

WES
It can wait--

That.

ANNALISE
Clearly it can't if you barged in
here this late.
(into the phone)
Frank. You didn't lock up. Again.
She hangs up, looks to Wes.
Speak.

ANNALISE (CONT'D)

WES
Right, um, I came across this case -Commonwealth vs. McGinnis -- which
says we can motion for a faster
verdict if we think the prosecution's
evidence is insufficient-ANNALISE
A directed verdict.
Huh?

WES

ANNALISE
What you're suggesting is called a
"directed verdict." If we ask for
one and get denied, all the jury
will hear is that the judge thinks
there's enough evidence to convict.
WES
But you discredited the first
assistant's testimony today and-ANNALISE
You had an idea, I'm telling you it
was a bad one. Good night, Seth.
Wes.
Right.

WES
ANNALISE

And now Annalise pushes him out the door.
END OF ACT TWO

Off a mortified Wes --

ACT THREE
21

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD
That night in the woods.

22

Patrick's SUV now idles outside a 7-11.

INT. PATRICK'S SUV - CONTINUOUS
It's eerily quiet, a nice respite from the panic of the previous
scenes, as Patrick sits in the driver's seat, Michaela and Laurel
in the back. Wes isn't there but the body is, rolled up in the
rug that's now shoved in the back. Laurel rolls down her window.
PATRICK
What the hell are you doing? It's
the middle of winter, we can't be
riding around with the windows down!!
LAUREL
I can't take the smell.
PATRICK
You should've thought of that before
you had the genius idea to move the
body.
LAUREL
You're not seriously still questioning
that decision?
PATRICK
Oh I think I'll be questioning it
for the rest of my life. In jail.
MICHAELA
Wow, now who's the one who needs to
calm down?
Shut up.

21

PATRICK

Suddenly the car door opens. Wes, wearing a hoody pulled up over
his head for cover, climbs in with a six pack of beer and a bag
full of contents we can't yet see. Patrick nods to it.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Did you get it all?
WES
Yup. Beer too in case they got me
on the surveillance video.
PATRICK
Don't worry, we'll just kill the
store owner if we need to.
(MORE)

22

32.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
(beat)
That was a joke. You do all know
that?
But they all just stay silent, too traumatized for jokes right
now. As we HOLD ON Patrick, driving them out of the parking lot,
wondering how the hell he ended up here, we FLASHBACK TO:
23

INT. UPSCALE BAR - NIGHT - 4 MONTHS EARLIER
Four months earlier, where a calmer, cooler, sexier Patrick carries
two drinks through a crowd of business-y types. He arrives at a
table occupied by OLIVER (30, glasses, nerdy cute).
PATRICK
Makers Manhattan, 2 cherries.
OLIVER
I'm getting the next round, otherwise
I refuse to drink this.
PATRICK
Deal. -- So you know, your coworkers over there seem to want a
show so say the word and we can start
making out.
Oliver turns to see what Patrick means -- several of Oliver's
BUSINESS-CASUAL-CLAD co-workers stealing glances at them.
OLIVER
Ignore them. I just don't talk to
guys at bars that often.
I can tell.

PATRICK

OLIVER
And now I'm leaving.
PATRICK
No you're not.
No I'm not.

OLIVER

They both smile, the chemistry fun and easy.
PATRICK
So, let me guess, you all work in
that advertising agency upstairs?
OLIVER
Is it that obvious?

23

33.
PATRICK
I work in the bank across the street
and the only hot guys who come here
are from your agency.
OLIVER
Hot, wow, I don't think I've ever
actually been called that. But I
don't work in the cool part of the
company if that's what you're
thinking. I'm in I.T.
Ding.

Patrick's just hit the jackpot.
I.T.?

PATRICK
No, I think I.T.'s very cool.

OLIVER
No, you think I.T.'s very dorky, as
does the rest of the world.
Maybe.
type.

PATRICK
But dorks are actually my

Oliver looks up, Patrick now giving him some serious sex-eye.
And now Patrick goes in for the kill.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Can I ask you something? Did you
know that secretary who tried to
kill her boss with an aspirin?
OLIVER
Yeah. But I'm not supposed to talk
about that actually. The legal
department warned us as soon as the
media got ahold of the story a few
days ago.
Oh.

Right.

PATRICK
Sorry I asked.

And now Patrick looks down, checking his phone, no longer
interested. Oliver realizes, he's screwed up here, especially
when Patrick now checks out another guy passing by...
OLIVER
Okay, I'll tell you a little bit.
But you have to promise -- you didn't
hear this from me.
As Patrick smiles, an oblivious Oliver falling into his trap...

34.
24

INT. HALLWAY, WES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

24

Wes walks his bike down the hall when he hears an ARGUMENT inside
Rebecca's apartment. The voices are muffled but angry-MAN
YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE-YOUR PROBLEM--

NO-

THAT'S

REBECCA
STOP YELLING-- THIS ISN'T ABOUT-MAN
IT'S ABOUT THE BOTH OF US!
Suddenly there's a loud CRASH, glass shattering inside. Wes steps
to the door, wanting to help when -- THE DOOR OPENS, a MAN IN A
BASEBALL CAP almost slamming into Wes.
WES

Hey.

LOGAN

Hey.

And now Wes realizes -- this man is none other than LOGAN O'REILLY,
Lila's football player fiancé. (And if we need to, we can flash
back to shots of the vigil to remind us who he is.) Logan moves
past Wes and into the stairwell. Wes looks back to Rebecca, now
picking up broken pieces of a lamp. He steps into the doorway.
Hey.

WES
Do you need help?

It's fine.

REBECCA

WES
Here, it's not a big deal.
Wes is about to help clean when Rebecca just snaps.
REBECCA
I said it's fine! So go!
of my apartment!

Get out

Wes stops. And even though her words say one thing, the look on
her face, the way her hands are shaking, say something different.
He wants to stay there, help, but instead he says -Got it.
He gets up and leaves.

WES
Off Rebecca, still shaking.

35.
25

INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

25

Annalise is reading over a PRINTED OUT EMAIL.
ANNALISE
How'd you get this?
Now we REVERSE ANGLE to find Patrick, pure confidence.
PATRICK
I'm not sure you really wanna know.
And as Annalise looks at him, intrigued, we FLASHBACK TO:
26

INT. OLIVER'S APARTMENT - THE NIGHT BEFORE

26

Patrick and Oliver are home from the bar and in full on make-out
mode, pulling off their shirts and pants. Suddenly Oliver stops.
OLIVER
I have a confession. I thought all
you wanted from me were those emails.
I did.

PATRICK
But I want this too.

And as Patrick pushes Oliver back on the bed, we CUT BACK TO:
27

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Back to Annalise and Patrick.
PATRICK
Point is, it wasn't exactly legal,
which I know means you can't use it
as evidence...
ANNALISE
No. That just means we have to get
creative. -- Bonnie!
As Patrick watches Annalise go talk to Bonnie, wondering what
she's up to, we DISSOLVE TO:
LATER. Annalise is now cross-examining LIONEL BRANDT (50s), a
professional, well-coifed Ad Man. Our students all watching.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Mr. Brandt, you met with Mr. Levinson
in his office the morning of the
accident, correct?
LIONEL BRANDT
Yes. As co-CEOs, we have a weekly
new business meeting.

27

36.
ANNALISE
Was there any discussion about my
client in the meeting?
LIONEL BRANDT
Yes. Arthur told me he was moving
Gina to accounting.
ANNALISE
So to avoid any possible sexual
harassment lawsuit?
LIONEL BRANDT
That's correct.
ANNALISE
Mr. Brandt, will you please read
this email?
Annalise now hands Lionel the printed email Patrick gave her.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor, can the defense please
specify what she's just handed the
witness?
ANNALISE
My apologies. This is an email the
witness wrote to Mr. Levinson. It
was in the discovery file given to
us by the prosecution, your honor.
A stunned Patrick hears this, muttering so only Wes can hear.
O.M.G.
What?

PATRICK
WES

He doesn't answer, instead watching as Lionel reads the email.
LIONEL BRANDT
Dear Arthur, after several days trying
to reason with you, I'm officially
requesting that you step down as coCEO. I've warned you about having
sexual relations with employees of
this company and have grown frustrated
with your refusal to stop-PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor, this email was not part
of the discovery file!

37.*
JUDGE POWELL
Ms. DeWitt, is that true?
ANNALISE
(feigning surprise)
Oh. I thought it was. Although my
junior counsel is more familiar with
the paperwork on this case. Bonnie?
Bonnie stands, not missing a beat.

Patrick watches in awe.

BONNIE
I found the email in the files given
to us by our client's previous
attorney, your honor. I just assumed
it was part of the discovery file.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
It wasn't. Which means it was
obviously obtained illegally.
ANNALISE
That is a ridiculous assumption,
your honor!
JUDGE POWELL
Is it, Ms. DeWitt?
ANNALISE
Yes! Not to mention the fact that
the content of this email pertains
to the case! It clearly should've
already been admitted into evidence!
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
The content's irrelevant, it's all
fruit of the poisonous tree!
JUDGE POWELL
ENOUGH.
(then, to Lionel)
Did you write this email, Mr. Brandt?
Yes.

LIONEL BRANDT

JUDGE POWELL
Then I have to side with Ms. DeWitt
here. The email's admissible.
Your honor!

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN

JUDGE POWELL
I've made my decision, Mr. Baldwin.

38.
ANNALISE
Thank you, your honor. -- Mr.
Brandt, as stated in your email, you
were angry at Mr. Levinson for taking
part in a sexual relationship with
an employee...
LIONEL BRANDT
I was frustrated, yes.
ANNALISE
So frustrated that perhaps you decided
to swap his blood pressure pill for
an aspirin during your meeting?
OBJECTION!
Ms. Dewitt.

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
JUDGE POWELL

ANNALISE
I withdraw the last question, your

Annalise sits, point made, nodding to Gina as the whole courtroom
buzzes about this masterful play...

Annalise, Frank, and Bonnie approach our 20 waiting students.

Wes smiles, enjoying

ANNALISE (CONT'D)
That said, we haven't won yet. I'll
be at the Dean's cocktail party if
you find anything before tomorrow.
She leaves, Bonnie and Frank in tow, as Michaela turns on Patrick.
MICHAELA
How'd you get that email?
PATRICK
I don't kiss and tell.
MICHAELA
What the hell does that mean??

39.
As Michaela chases after Patrick, Laurel rolls her eyes and peels
off from the group, always one to avoid the fray. We go with her
as she walks toward the restroom and passes wheelchair-bound
Arthur, agitated as he clings to his wife Agnes...
No.

NO!

ARTHUR
Please don't please don't...

AGNES
It's just the restroom sweetie, I'll
be right back.
As Laurel takes that in -- wow that's depressing -- she enters-29

INT. WOMAN'S RESTROOM, COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Where Gina is checking her make-up in the mirror. Laurel pauses,
thinking for a moment, then hurries into a stall so Gina doesn't
see her. And now we're inside the stall with Laurel. She peeks
through the crack in the door just as Agnes enters, stopping as
she sees Gina. The two of them look at each other, and instead
of the awkward, tense encounter between wife and mistress we all
expect, Agnes smiles and gives Gina a tender squeeze on the hand
before heading into a stall. As Laurel takes this in, her head
now spinning...

INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A COCKTAIL PARTY. Our 1Ls are dressed up, downing champagne and
mixing with PROFESSORS. Wes arrives at the front door, greeted
by the liquored-up DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL and his BORED WIFE.
DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL
Welcome! Dean Howard. This is my
wife, Constance.
Wes Gibbins.

WES
Thank you so much for--

Before Wes can finish, the Dean moves to the next arriving student.
DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL
Welcome! Dean Howard. This is my
wife, Constance...
Across the room, Wes spots Patrick, Michaela, and Doucheface
talking to TOM (40s, handsome, friendly). Tom is a breath of
fresh air in this competitive environment -- positive, encouraging,
nice even. As Wes joins...
TOM
First year's the worst, no doubt.
Just put your head down, do the work,
and try not to take it so seriously.
DOUCHEFACE
You're obviously not a lawyer.

40.
TOM
A psychology professor. I know,
you've just lost all respect for me,
but I work with the firm sometimes -evaluating clients, reading witnesses.
(noticing Wes)
And you are?
PATRICK
This is Wes, Tom. He's in your wife's
class too.
TOM
(shaking his hand)
How's it going so far, Wes? Has she
gone full terrorist on you yet?
WES
I'm sorry...who's your wife?
MICHAELA
Professor DeWitt.
(to Tom, sucking up)
Who can I just say, is literally my
personal hero. Her and Hillary of
course...
As Wes takes this in, confused -- Tom is not the Naked Man he saw
Annalise with -- a smiling Annalise arrives with two drinks.
TOM
There she is! Let me guess -- your
ears were burning?
ANNALISE
Maybe just a little.
TOM
Don't worry, I didn't spill any
secrets. Well, not yet at least...
And as they all laugh and Tom gives his wife a tender kiss on the
cheek, Annalise stares straight at Wes and we -END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
31

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD

31

Back in the woods, where our four exhausted, aching students lug
the rug through the dark. Patrick holds a flashlight when they
SUDDENLY HEAR GIGGLING IN THE DISTANCE. Our four all hit the
ground, hiding. Wes whispers to Patrick.
Flashlight.

WES

Patrick shuts it off just as a DRUNK COUPLE comes into view,
heading right for them. Our four all share looks, panicked, as
the couple finally stops, making out up against a nearby tree.
Hey.

DRUNK GIRL
Jen can't find out about this.

DRUNK GUY
I'm not gonna tell her.
And now they kiss again, pulling at their zippers, about to go
for it right there, our four all panicking when...a RINGTONE PLAYS.
DRUNK GIRL
What is that??
It's Laurel's cell! As she goes to silence it, we see the name
"Frank" along with a PHOTO of him smiling on the phone's screen.
Hey!

DRUNK GUY
Who's there??

Our four stay silent, faces pressed into the dirt.
DRUNK GIRL
Can we get out of here?
And now the couple runs off as fast as they can. Once they're
gone, Laurel breathes a big sigh of relief. That is, until-MICHAELA
Why is Frank calling you?

I saw your phone, Laurel.

an answer, we HOLD ON LAUREL'S SCARED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO --

EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT - 4 MONTHS EARLIER
Laurel, 4 months earlier, knocks on the front door.

32

Frank answers.

LAUREL
Frank, hi, I'm in DeWitt's class.
FRANK
Shouldn't you be at that party?
LAUREL
I hate those things. And I saw
something today at the courthouse
that I think you should know about.
And as Frank wonders what she means, we TIME CUT TO:
33

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Where Frank is now laughing at Laurel.

Hard.

FRANK
Sorry, I was just imagining if
Annalise heard what just came out of
your mouth... Ooohff, it would've
been ugly.
(then, straight faced)
But of course you already knew that
or else you would've gone to her
with this tall tale rather than me.
And now he's just looking right through her.
LAUREL
I only saw them touch hands, I know,
but think about it. A wife gets so
tired of her husband cheating that
she enlists his mistress to team up
for revenge.
FRANK
Fine, say you're right, they went
tag team on the guy. What the hell
do you expect us to do about it?
Put you on the stand so the jury
will definitely have enough evidence
to convict our client?
LAUREL
No...obviously not, I just...
(beat, realizing)
You already knew.
FRANK
I didn't say that.

33

43.
Frank just holds her look. His face betraying nothing.
suddenly understands just who she's dealing with here.

Laurel

LAUREL
Right. Because then you'd actually
be admitting, out loud, that you're
defending a guilty client. And who
really has time to deal with the
moral repercussions of that?
Pissed, Laurel starts to head out.

Frank calls after her.

FRANK
Brown, right? Or was it Smith?
Berkeley? What bastion of liberalism
turned you into such a goody goody?
Laurel stops, turns back to him, suddenly feeling naked.
LAUREL
Brown. -- You read my application
or something?
FRANK
Just a guess. We get a lot of you
around here. Smart, idealistic girls
who come to law school to help the
less fortunate only to end up taking
a corporate job after graduation
which they then quit the second they
get pregnant because they'd rather
stay home. For the child of course.
LAUREL
You're a misogynistic ass.
She storms off, slamming the door on her way out. Only now does
Frank look up to see Bonnie standing there, having heard all that.
Stop.

BONNIE
Screwing. The students.

She leaves, Frank calling after her as she goes.
FRANK
Who else am I gonna screw?! We live
at this office, I don't have time to
go meet real girls!!
She doesn't answer, already gone, as we stay with Frank, whose
face drops just the slightest to reveal the loneliness underneath
the tough-guy act. But now he pushes it away, gets back to work...

INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

34

Back at the party, where Patrick, Michaela, Doucheface, and a
still spinning Wes all stand in a huddle as they watch Annalise
and Tom talk to the Dean across the room. Tom's laughing at a
joke, his hand on Annalise's lower back...
MICHAELA
I knew she was married, I just never
expected to someone so-PATRICK

Hot.

MICHAELA

Nice.

DOUCHEFACE
He married a sociopath, he's clearly
not that nice.
(off their looks)
What? I want this job as much of
any of you, but you've all got your
heads in the sand if you don't think
that bitch is cray.
You okay?

PATRICK

He's talking to Wes, who's now looking very distressed.
Yeah.

WES
I'm gonna go find the bathroom.

As Wes peels off, passing Annalise, who we now see watching him...
35

INT. BATHROOM, DEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Wes enters, about to close the door, when Annalise enters, locking
the door behind them. It's a tight space, intimate.
WES
I'm not going to say anything.
Honestly, the fact that I even saw
you that night was my fault-ANNALISE
Stop. I need to apologize. I put
you in a terrible position. It's
unprofessional, not to mention
embarrassing...
She stops, her voice cracking, eyes welling up. Wes -- and we -are shocked. This isn't a person we ever thought we'd see cry.

35

45.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
We've been trying to have a baby.
For a long time now. And I hate to
make excuses but...it's been a lot
of pressure. On our marriage and...
(then, realizing)
Oh my god, I'm totally making this
worse. Forgive me.
And now she places her hand on Wes's arm, looking at him. Like
she might kiss him or hit him. You just can never tell with her.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Thank you for keeping this between
us.
She's holding his look, intense.
No problem.

So Wes just nods.

WES
I'll just...leave now.

He rushes out the door. But we stay with Annalise, who just stares
at herself in the mirror, her tears quickly drying up because,
well, it was all an act. As she cleans up her now runny mascara,
matter of fact and emotionless, us wondering what her deal is...
36

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
Bonnie and Frank work when Annalise and Tom return home, holding
hands. Bonnie lights up at the sight of Tom.
BONNIE
Tom! How was Harvard? They loved
you, right? Offered you the whole
department?
TOM
We're just having some preliminary
talks. No one's moving anywhere
yet. What'd I miss here? Besides
you guys kicking ass on the new case.
FRANK
Don't jinx it. We haven't even
started our defense yet.
TOM
I'm only repeating what I read in
the Times.
(then, to Annalise)
You coming up? I've missed you.
And now he pulls her in, kissing her, just like their marriage is
perfect. Bonnie watches, a little uncomfortable, clearly knowing
some secrets. Finally they break apart, Annalise smiling.

36

46.
ANNALISE
I'll be up soon.
TOM
Make it very soon.
(to Bonnie and Frank)
Go home! You've won the case already!
He heads upstairs as Annalise walks into...
37

INT. ANNALISE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
She gets on her computer as Frank enters with some FILES.
FRANK
Here are the background checks.
Mostly DUIs and pot possession...
Although you should know the annoying
kid's dad is a circuit judge.
He means Doucheface, whose file/photo Annalise now stops at as
she flips through the students' files.
ANNALISE
That could be helpful. Put him in
the yes pile. Along with these.
She hands him some of the files back, but Frank sees that Laurel
is now on top of the reject pile. He pauses for a beat, thinking
about Bonnie's advice, but then picks up Laurel's file anyway.
FRANK
Actually, this girl's pretty good.
ANNALISE
"Laurel Wilding?" I have no idea
who that is.
FRANK
That's actually her strength. She
flies under the radar, notices things.
We could use someone like that.
ANNALISE
Fine, put her back in. Also, run
one on the waitlist kid.
FRANK
I thought we gave that kid the ax.
ANNALISE
I changed my mind. Wes is his name.
Wes Gibbins.
And as Frank leaves, us wondering what plan Annalise has for Wes...

38

INT. WES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

38

Where Wes lies in bed, mind still racing, heavy with the burden
of Annalise's secret, as he stares at the fingernail scratches on
the wall. And now he puts his own hand up to them, seeing that
his hand is an exact match. As he traces the scratches, he
suddenly hears someone outside his door, a shadow peeking through.
Wes jumps up, opens the door, and finds -- a BOTTLE OF SCOTCH.
Hey!

WES

He's talking to Rebecca, now trying to sneak into her apartment.
REBECCA
Oh. Hey. That's just to say sorry
for the other night. And the night
before that. I stole it from the
bar I work at so don't think I'm
actually that nice.
WES
I've heard the music you listen to.
I never thought you were nice.
She smiles, shy but charmed, then goes to unlock her door as Wes
now looks at the post-it attached to the bottle -- "Welcome to
the neighborhood. Rebecca." And now he gets a burst of courage.
WES (CONT'D)
Rebecca!... Should we open it maybe?
I kinda had a weird night and could
use some heavy drinking...
REBECCA
I can't tonight, sorry.
She goes into her apartment.
39

Off Wes, a little crush forming.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING

Another day in court.
ANNALISE (PRE-LAP)
Your honor, this is a trick!
40

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
A livid Annalise now stands up, yelling.
ANNALISE
The prosecution hasn't informed me
about any new evidence!
JUDGE POWELL
Approach the bench, counsel.

40

48.
Annalise and the prosecutor go to the judge.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
The police just gave me the video
last night, Annalise. You can try
and stall all you want but it's
damning enough without showing the
jury you don't want them to see it.
JUDGE POWELL
It's your call, Ms. DeWitt.
And as Annalise debates, we TIME CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER. The prosecutor questions a very young, nervous
DETECTIVE GILL (25, voice shaky) who is now on the stand.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
You got the call from the convenience
store when, Detective Gill?
DETECTIVE GILL
Approximately 7pm on Tuesday.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
So 2 nights ago. What happened next?
DETECTIVE GILL
I went to the store and met with the
owner, Mr. Lira, who gave me the
original copy of his surveillance
camera video. He said he saw the
defendant's picture on the news and
remembered she came into his store a
few months ago, how she seemed real
nervous at the time, so he looked
through his old surveillance video
until he found the footage of her.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Footage that I will now play for
everyone here.
He presses play on a remote, SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM A CONVENIENCE
STORE now playing on screens for the entire courtroom. There's
no audio but there's a date stamped into the image as Gina is
shown buying a bottle of pills at the register. As he PAUSES...
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN (CONT'D)
There. The night before the murder
attempt, Ms. Sadowski bought this
item at Mr. Lira's store. And if we
zoom in on the bottle, what does it
say, Detective?

49.
Soloxacore.

DETECTIVE GILL
It's a brand of aspirin.

As Bonnie and Frank share a look -- we're fucked -- the prosecutor
turns to Annalise.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your witness.
ANNALISE
Your honor, I'd like a recess.
JUDGE POWELL
You've got one hour, Ms. DeWitt.
And as the courtroom breaks up, Patrick turns to Wes...
PATRICK
Aaaand we're screwed.

ANNALISE (O.S.)
You had one job!

INT. COURTHOUSE ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Inside, Annalise YELLS at a teary Gina. It's the first time we're
seeing Annalise's full fury. It's powerful and scary and clearly
what makes her good at her job. Bonnie and Frank look away.
ANNALISE
To let us know what bodies we needed
to bury! Texts, calls, ANYTHING WE
NEEDED TO DESTROY. You didn't so
guess what? You go to jail and I'm
the shoddy lawyer who put you there!
GINA
I had a headache!

It isn't what it--

ANNALISE
STOP LYING TO ME!
Gina startles, shaking.

Finally Annalise breathes.

ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Get out, I can't think with you here.
Gina flees.

Once they're alone...
FRANK
She's not wrong, Annalise.
aspirin, we all buy it--

It's

50.
ANNALISE
Who was it, Frank? What slutty
undergrad pulled down her pants and
made you forget how to do your job
this time?!
FRANK
I grilled Gina the minute we got
this case. She obviously chose not
to tell me this because, well, it's
obvious, ain't it? She's guilty-ANNALISE
ENOUGH WITH THE EXCUSES!
And the way Annalise now looks at him -- a mix of disgust and
rage -- makes this grown man cower.
I'm sorry.

FRANK
I'll do better next time.

Bonnie steps forward, taking control, the mediator.
BONNIE
We have 1 hour, I say we put Gina on
the stand, have her testify that she
had a migraine.
ANNALISE
The prosecution will destroy her in
the cross. Our only option is to
discredit the video.
FRANK
We could call the store owner into
question.
BONNIE
Yes, throw doubt into why it took
him so long to turn over the footage.
No.

ANNALISE

BONNIE
It's a good idea!
ANNALISE
And I have a better one.
to either of you.

No thanks

Annalise leaves. Bonnie looks to Frank, about to say something
comforting when suddenly he PICKS UP A CHAIR AND THROWS IT. As
it CRASHES AGAINST THE DOOR, we CUT TO:

43

INT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER
Wes, Patrick, Laurel, Michaela and all the students are straining
to hear what's going on at the front of the courtroom where
Annalise and the prosecutor are sidebar-ing with Judge Powell.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
He's not a detective on this case,
your honor. I don't see how his
testimony could be at all relevant.
ANNALISE
Relevance will become clear during
testimony. And his sudden addition
to our witness list is a result of
the prosecution conveniently springing
this video on us at the last minute.
JUDGE POWELL
I'll allow the testimony. I assume
the witness is here and ready to
testify?
ANNALISE
I had him called in.
JUDGE POWELL
Let's move it along then.
Annalise and the prosecutor return to their tables...
ANNALISE
I'd like to call our first witness
to the stand. Detective Nate Seidel.
Our students share a confused look -Who's that?

LAUREL

WES
I have no idea-But Wes stops -- because now he sees DETECTIVE NATE SEIDEL (38)
enter from the back of the courtroom. Detective Nate Seidel who
is also the Naked Man he saw Annalise having sex with in Act 2.
Nate walks up the aisle, whispering angrily and discretely to
Annalise as he passes her...
NATE
What the hell is this?
She doesn't answer but just smiles, not giving him anything as
Nate now then heads to take the oath. Off Wes -- and all of the
audience -- wondering what in the hell Annalise is up to, as we -END ACT FOUR

EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD

Our Four now reach the same spot where we first met them, as they
drag the rug to the middle of the clearing. Exhausted, chests
heaving, they all collapse on the ground. Except for Wes.
WES
Come on, get up, we have to do this.
They don't move.

So beaten down.

WES (CONT'D)
I SAID GET UP!
They finally stand as we STAY ON Wes, who now pulls a BOTTLE OF
LIGHTER FLUID from the 7-11 bag. And as we realize, they're going
to burn the body, we HOLD ON a tireless Wes and FLASHBACK TO:
45

INT. COURTROOM - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER
Where a now confused Wes watches Annalise question her lover.
Nate vibrates with anger, visibly pissed to be here.
ANNALISE
Detective Seidel, a junior detective
under your supervision just testified
that, 2 nights ago, he received a
video my client appears in.
PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor, Detective Seidel wasn't
here when that video was played.
ANNALISE
I'm simply trying to establish a
timeline here, your honor.
JUDGE POWELL
Get to your point, Ms. DeWitt.
Annalise goes to the stand and puts her hand on the box, her
fingers just inches away from Nate. She looks him in the eye,
direct and eerily calm as she now drops a bomb-ANNALISE
Where were you 2 nights ago Detective?
What?

NATE

ANNALISE
2 nights ago, when Detective Gill
acquired this tape, weren't you
(MORE)

45

53.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
supposed to be working at the precinct
as Detective Gill's direct supervisor?
Nate looks to our young Detective Gill sitting in the front row.
I was.

NATE

ANNALISE
And were you there?
And as Nate now sits there, stunned, we move to Wes, who is equally
stunned, because of course he knows where all three of them were
2 nights ago, a scene we now QUICKLY FLASHBACK TO:
46

INT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

46

Wes knocks on her office door...
WES
Professor DeWitt-And the slight pressure of his knock now makes the door slide
open enough so Wes now can now see a NAKED MAN, NATE, POP UP FROM
BELOW THE DESK. Annalise jumps up, quickly pulling down her skirt.
Oh my god.

WES (CONT'D)

NATE
Get the hell out!
CUT BACK TO:
47

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

47

CLOSE ON WES, his mind spinning as he watches Annalise in action.
Nate hasn't answered yet, just glaring at his girlfriend.
ANNALISE
Please answer the question, Detective.
No.

NATE
I was not.

ANNALISE
Where were you then? Home perhaps?
Taking care of your wife? I
understand she's recently been
diagnosed with cancer...
And now Nate gets just what Annalise is doing here, that she's
threatening him, and that he better play along. He answers.

54.
No.

NATE
I...was at a friend's.

ANNALISE
Okay. Let's be clear then. 2 nights
ago, when you were scheduled to be
at work, you were not present when
Detective Gill received this footage?
NATE
That's correct.
ANNALISE
I only ask because there's something
I find strange about the chain of
custody on this video. Detective
Gill testified that he received the
video from the store owner at 8pm,
but the logs say he didn't log it
into custody until 2:09am. Don't
you find that time gap odd?
NATE
No. Sometimes it can take us a while
to log evidence into the computer.
ANNALISE
Because you're all so busy?
friends and such?

Visiting

Shit. Annalise is out for blood. Wes watches it all, his heart
pounding as he waits to see what will happen next.
NATE
I'm sure Detective Gill had a good
reason why it took him that long.
ANNALISE
Perhaps. Or perhaps he needed the
extra time to doctor the video and
further incriminate my client...
Your honor!

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN

JUDGE POWELL
That was out of line, Ms. DeWitt.
ANNALISE
I withdraw my last statement. -Detective, in your 12 years working
for the city of Philadelphia, have
you ever known an instance where
video footage was altered to help
the prosecution get a conviction?

55.
Objection!

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN

ANNALISE
Digitally adding an aspirin label to
a bottle of vitamins for example?!!
YOUR HONOR!

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN

And now Annalise turns to the judge, quick and badass.
ANNALISE
I'm simply asking Detective Seidel
about his personal experience within
his department.
JUDGE POWELL
This is the last question I'll allow.
ANNALISE
Thank you, your honor.
(then, to Nate)
Are you personally aware of any
instances of doctored surveillance
footage within your department?
And now the whole room waits for Nate to answer the question.
But Nate just looks straight at Annalise, her looking right back
at him. It's a stand off. Finally Nate answers.
Yes.

I am.

NATE

And as the whole courtroom ERUPTS, Wes shocked, we SMASH CUT TO:
48

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

A victorious Annalise stands with Gina before a GROUP OF REPORTERS.
ANNALISE
I took this case pro bono knowing an
innocent woman had been scapegoated
by a desperate, overworked D.A.'s
office. Gina is and always has been
innocent and we're just so happy the
jury was able to see that...
At the bottom of the steps, our students watch, in absolute awe.
MICHAELA
I want to be her.
Me too.

PATRICK

(quiet)
I don't.

LAUREL

Wes looks to Laurel, noticing that she's watching Agnes Levinson
stand at a nearby curb as Arthur's nurse helps him into the car.
Agnes is looking straight at Gina, the two of them sharing a
knowing, conspiratorial smile. And then Agnes climbs into the
car, Wes now whispering to Laurel...
WES
What do you know?
Laurel turns to Wes.

Debating whether to tell him.

Nothing.

LAUREL

And as Laurel leaves, we go OFF WES, watching Annalise with the
press and wondering whether this case was all one big lie...

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Criminal Law class, the white board full of legal legal as Annalise
finishes up. Frank and Bonnie are also there.
ANNALISE
Tomorrow we start work on a new case -a pastor accused of embezzling from
his own church -- so let's find out
which of you will be helping us out
at the office. First, the standout
of this class, the one you should
all make it your mission to destroy...
Mr. Donahue, come get your trophy.
And like a king rising to take his rightful crown, Patrick collects
his trophy from Annalise.
PATRICK
I'm gonna work my ass off for you.
He turns, shooting a little "ha ha" glance at an enraged Michaela.
ANNALISE
The others joining us will be...Asher
Millstone.
Yes!

DOUCHEFACE

Doucheface pumps his fist, everyone rolling their eyes.
ANNALISE
Laurel Wilding.

Of course.

57.
Stunned, Laurel looks to Frank, smiling right at her, which Bonnie
clocks, rolling her eyes, knowing exactly where this is going.
But now the whole class sits up straighter, dying to be the last
name called, especially Michaela, who might pee her pants...
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Michaela Pratt.
MICHAELA
Oh thank god.
(to Annalise)
I mean -- thank you.
(to Bonnie and Frank)
All of you.
Everyone sinks in their seats, defeated.

Wes looks relieved when--

ANNALISE
And because our workload has grown
I've decided to hire one more of
you. That student is...Wes Gibbins.
And as the whole room goes quiet, shocked, but no one more so
than Wes, we CUT TO:

WES
You got him to lie on the stand.
About there being doctored videos...
Annalise just looks at him, her face revealing nothing.
a step closer. Intense yet calm.

She takes

ANNALISE
Is that why I picked you? Because I
thought I picked you for showing
initiative coming to my office that
night. And because your directed
verdict idea showed you think outside
the box. And because your self
defense argument proved you were
good on your feet. Those are all
qualities I look for in my employees.
I was excited for you to be one of
them. But now that you've exposed
exactly what you think of yourself,
that you don't believe you deserve
this job-WES
That's not what I-ANNALISE
That is exactly what you said. Right
before you accused me of having my
boyfriend lie under oath to win this
case. We won because of our defense -pinning it on the business partner,
discrediting an eye-witness, making
the jury feel for Gina. But of course
you don't understand that because
you don't understand anything. You're
a 1L -- soft, uneducated, dumb. So
dumb you might still decide to turn
down this job.
Wes stops, looking up at her, surprised.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
Yes, I'm letting you reconsider.
Think carefully because everything
that comes after this moment will
determine not the type of career you
have, but life. You can either spend
it in a sad corporate office drafting
contracts and hitting on chubby
paralegals until finally putting a
gun in your mouth...or you can join
my firm and become a person who does
something with his life. So decide.
Now. Do you want the job or not?
Off Wes, both repulsed and attracted, terrified and excited...

INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

51

Just another night at Kappa Alpha Theta. SORORITY GIRLS text and
eat fro-yo in their lululemon as they listen to a MEAN GIRL vent.
MEAN GIRL
I mean, what kind of trash goes around
saying a girl who might be dead is a
crack whore?? She's lucky JC was
there to hold me back because, you
guys, I swear, I woulda cut the bitch.
The DOORBELL rings. A BOUNCY GIRL opens the door to find a
MAINTENANCE WORKER (30s, sketchy) holding a toolbox.
MAINTENANCE WORKER
Someone call about low water pressure?
BOUNCY GIRL
(shouting to the others)
Guys! Did anyone call maintenance?
No one answers, too entrenched in Meanie's riveting story. Bouncy
contemplates what to do, and just as we're yelling at our TV -do not let this sketchball into your house -- she opens the door.
BOUNCY GIRL (CONT'D)
I think the water thingy's upstairs.
He enters, pausing as he glimpses the real life porn movie before
him -- 20-year-old boobs and butts, some girls doing a dance
routine to a Miley video on TV. He licks his lips a little, then
heads up the stairs, passing a girl wrapped only in a towel, then
a room of girls laughing on a bed...and right when we think he's
going to do something terrible, he opens the door to the attic,
heads upstairs, and opens another door that brings us out to -THE ROOF. He heads over to a 6 foot high WATER TANK, opens the
lid, and reaches his hand inside. He feels around, deeper now,
struggling to get a hold of an object blocking the pipe. FINALLY,
he yanks it free. Looks at what he's holding -- a HAND. Which
is connected to an ARM. Which is connected to the BLOATED, DROWNED
BODY OF LILA STANGARD. Off this grown man SCREAMING like a girl...
52

EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
Annalise parks her car in front of the garage, then steps out,
heading toward the back door when she SUDDENLY STOPS, gasping.
We REVERSE to see a dark, angry Nate now stepping out of the dark.
Annalise looks scared, her eyes now darting around for an escape
path. It's dark here though, far off from the street, only a
small light from the back door casting shadows over their faces.

52

60.
ANNALISE
Tom's inside.
NATE
Good. Maybe he'll catch us. You
wouldn't mind that though, right?
You were all ready to out us today
in that courtroom anyway...
ANNALISE
I would never have done that.
NATE
No. You just wanted to threaten me
with it.
Nate...

ANNALISE

NATE
Just tell me this -- it was a long
con, right? You picking me up that
night? Screwing me all these months?
All because you knew that, eventually,
you'd need to use me for a case?
ANNALISE
Don't be dramatic.
Now Nate CHARGES her, PINNING her against the garage, his fingers
digging into her shoulders, so full of rage and desperation.
NATE
You made me lie under oath! Sell
out my department, the people I work
with! Don't you get that?! Or do
you just not care?! You just use
people, right?! Collect them and
screw them and spit them out when
you're done! That's what gets you
off! It doesn't matter whose life
is ruined in the process, just as
long as you win and go home to your
big house and trust fund husband who
never learned how to screw you right!
A long beat as Annalise takes in his fury. But if she's scared,
she isn't showing it. Instead she speaks calmly, coolly...
ANNALISE
I never lied about how I feel about
you.
He holds her look, debating whether to trust her. Finally, he
takes a step back, getting control. A long moment passes.

61.
ANNALISE (CONT'D)
And let's be clear -- you're the one
who picked me up.
And now she's smiling, sexy and flirty and in control, which is
all Nate needs to push her up against the garage, kissing her
hungrily, her kissing him back. And as they tear at each other's
clothes, gasping and grinding and engaging in the kind of public,
messy, animal sex we'd never dare have ourselves, we move to...

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

53

A REPORTER stands outside the Kappa house.
spectators are in the background.

Police cars and

REPORTER
Police are confirming that a woman's
body was found inside the Kappa Alpha
Theta house on Middleton's campus...

INT. COLLEGE BAR - NIGHT

54

Rebecca pours jager shots at this loud, divey, college bar.
REBECCA
That'll be 42 bucks.

-- Dude...

The FRAT BOY doesn't answer because, like EVERYONE IN THE BAR,
his attention is on the NEWS REPORT on TV: "Woman's body found
at Middleton." Rebecca turns down the music to now hear...
REPORTER (ON TV)
Whether that woman is Lila Stangard,
fiancé to Middleton football star
Logan O'Reilly, remains to be seen...
Suddenly Rebecca's phone rings -- "Logan calling." As she picks
up and runs into a backroom, we hold on the TV and MATCH CUT TO:
55

INT. BEDROOM, ANNALISE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Annalise's husband Tom watches the SAME NEWS REPORT. He leans
toward the TV, his knuckles gripping a glass of scotch...
REPORTER (ON TV)
That said, we do have word that there
are currently police cars parked
outside the house of her parents,
Stuart and Miranda Stangard, owners
of billion dollar tech company
Stangard Industries...
ANNALISE (O.S.)
What's going on?
Tom startles, turning to see Annalise, still flush from Nate.

55

62.
TOM
My student. They found her drowned
in some sort of water tank...
His student? Now we get why he seems so shaken. Or maybe for
another reason we'll learn later. Whatever it is, Annalise
notices. She goes to him, puts a comforting arm around him.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.

ANNALISE
TOM
I just...her poor parents.

They sit there for a beat. Sitting in the sadness of it.
then, quiet and emotionless--

But

ANNALISE
I bet the boyfriend did it.
And now Tom looks up, holding her look for a beat.
Yeah.

TOM
I guess we'll see.

And as we leave them there, watching the news about Lila, us
feeling the weight of their secrets, we move to..
56

INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

56

Patrick, Laurel, and Michaela work at a table filled with books
and files. Patrick admires his trophy, trying to annoy Michaela.
PATRICK
It's heavier than I thought.
Honestly. Feel it-SUDDENLY Michaela RIPS the trophy out of his hand and THROWS IT
ON THE FLOOR. THUD. Everyone in the library looks over.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Someone's got a temper on her, huh?
Hey.

WES (O.S.)

They look up, Wes now standing there.
WES (CONT'D)
Sorry I'm late. I stopped to pick
up something we can celebrate with.
He pulls Rebecca's SCOTCH and some plastic cups from his backpack.
Patrick grabs the bottle, starts to pour.

63.
PATRICK
I love this kid. Shots all around.
LAUREL
Annalise wants our findings by 8am.
PATRICK
She'll get them. Let's just take a
moment to feel good about ourselves.
(toasting)
To whatever hell this is we just
signed up for.
(flat)
Cheers.

WES/MICHAELA/LAUREL/PATRICK

They all down the shots, simpler times, when Doucheface Asher
shows up holding some books.
Hey.

DOUCHEFACE ASHER
What'd I miss?

And as we leave them all there, looking at Doucheface, us now
wondering if it's him in that rug, we FLASH FORWARD TO:
57

EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD
Our four, no longer strangers, standing around the BODY, its face
still hidden from us. Patrick, Michaela, and Laurel finish placing
scraps of wood around the body as Wes pulls out a box of matches.
WES
Okay. Last chance. Either we all
agree or we stop right now.
Just do it.

MICHAELA

LAUREL
Hurry, so the bonfire can cover the
smoke.
And they all look to Patrick, who is a wreck, but finally nods.
PATRICK
It's the only way to destroy the
DNA.
Finally, Wes lights the match. And it's only now that the light
exposes the FACE OF THE MURDER VICTIM. It's Tom, Annalise's
husband. And as Wes drops the match, Tom's body BURSTING INTO
FLAMES, the four of them watching their lives change forever,
knowing there's no going back, we...FADE OUT.
