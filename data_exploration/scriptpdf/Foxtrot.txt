FOXTROT
A screenplay by Samuel Maoz

2
1. INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR / VIEW THROUGH A MOVING VEHICLE /
EARLY EVENING
Winter. Mud and fog. An orange sun peeking from time to
time through the fog. View through a side window, partly
open. A stained window pane. Motor of a heavy vehicle,
presumably a truck, in a monotonous, dull rattle. A long
drive.
QUIET YOUNG MAN'S VOICE (VO)
Do you know why they suddenly decided
to send me home?
ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE
What do I know? I'm just the driver.
We don't see them; just hear their voices against the
passing gloomy landscape.
Broken sounds of a piano enter the soundtrack. Like dry
tears. Like faded childhood pictures, a childhood
remembered mainly in longing.
Title: FOXTROT
2. INTERIOR / STAIRWELL / EARLY MORNING
Closed view of an apartment's doorbell. A MAN’s finger
presses it briefly and lets go. A sticker in faded
handwriting, stuck to the doorbell: Feldman Family.
3. INTERIOR / STAIRWELL TO APARTMENT / EARLY MORNING
We're facing the front door. A short silence. The click
of a key turning and the door opens. DAFNA, in her
forties, in her nightgown. Wearing a thrown-on dressing
gown, her hair disheveled, she stares at us wide-eyed.
Then blurrily. The color drains from her face, her
breathing halting. She stares at us like a lost child.
MICHAEL, 45, gets up from his chair deep within the
living room—but remains frozen and stares at us with the
same stunned look.
MAN'S VOICE:
Mrs Feldman?
A trickle of blood escapes her nose and she silently
collapses.

3
A MILITARY OFFICER, 30, in dress uniform, and a SLIGHTLY
OLDER MAN in a starched field uniform jump into both
sides of the frame. The officer gets hold of her
collapsing body and the man grabs her head before it hits
the wall. They gently set her down on the floor. A FEMALE
SOLDIER, 20, in khakis, joins them and helps steady her.
They move quietly, in an automatic rhythm, without a
word. The officer takes her pulse and the man, apparently
a doctor, puts on a stethoscope. Dafna sways on the
border of consciousness and tries to tell him something,
but her pupils widen, her eyes roll back, and she starts
to convulse. In an oppressive silence, the OFFICER holds
her, the female soldier pulls apart the dressing gown and
disinfects the naked thigh with some imbued cotton wool,
while the DOCTOR fills a syringe and injects her. MICHAEL
stays behind, paralyzed, and stares at the scene without
being able to move or say a word. They take her out of
the frame. Michael, frozen and silent, stays, standing
alone in the dining area adjoining the living room, next
to an empty chair, a cup of coffee, and a newspaper.
We leave him in a long movement and follow the rest. A
corridor. The opening to a bedroom. Dafna is already
lying on a wide bed. Wintry sunlight comes in through the
open window and they move silently between darkness and
light, and connect her to a drip and an oxygen mask. The
officer leaves the room. We follow him back to the living
room. He goes to Michael, still frozen and stunned, stops
in front of him, and says
OFFICER
Mr Feldman, are you listening to me?
Michael doesn't react. He briefly stares at the officer
and suddenly stumbles for a split second, collapses into
himself, but immediately catches himself and regains his
balance.
The officer grabs him gently, and says quietly
OFFICER
Come. Sit down.
He supports Michael, who sinks down woodenly and sits.
The officer examines his scattered look, and says
OFFICER
Mr Feldman, I'm sorry, there's no
easy way to tell you that your son,
Corporal Jonathan Feldman, was killed
in action last night.
Michael doesn't react, just stares at him with a dazed
look. Through the big window behind his head is a long
crane cutting across a dark sky in a slow circle.

4
Silence.
Faraway whimpering comes into the soundtrack.
In a long movement we leave them, go back to the
corridor, and pass by the opening to the bedroom. Dafna
lies without moving. The soldier closes a yellowish
curtain over the window. The room turns dusky. The
silhouette of the doctor packing his bag on the
background of the vivid splash of light through the
curtain.
The whimpering is closer now. We turn and approach the
closed door at the end of the corridor. A thick, opaque
pane. Beyond the glass the fuzzy silhouette of a large
dog jumping up and down and rubbing against the length of
the door, whimpering and breaking the silence. We come
closer to the glass and stop, facing the leaping shadow
of the whimpering dog for a long moment.
CUT TO BLACK
Title: MICHAEL
4A. INTERIOR / MICHAEL AND DAFNA'S APARTMENT / MORNING
MICHAEL's eye fills the screen. The pupil is expanded and
the eye is reddened and moist.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Follow my finger.
The eye moves to the right and left, following the blurry
movement of the finger that periodically crosses the
front of the frame.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Now open your eye wide.
The eye opens. A narrow, powerful beam of light turns on
in it.
The eyelid trembles and opens wide. The pupil contracts.
4B. INTERIOR / MICHAEL AND DAFNA'S APARTMENT / MORNING
*THE ENTIRE SCENE IN CLOSE-UP OF MICHAEL. WE DON'T SEE
THE MILITARY TEAM; ONLY HEAR THEM.
CU of Michael. He looks up into the beam of light.
Another moment and the light goes out. He looks ahead—
shocked, miserable, and lost—half listening, half
disconnected.
DOCTOR'S VOICE

5
Your blood pressure and pulse are
normal. Do you have a heart
condition?
Michael shakes his head. His look is distracted, his eyes
moist.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Asthma..?
Shake of the head, same stare.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Epilepsy? Dizziness?
Same mechanical "no" movement.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
I'm leaving you some pills. Here.
Michael turns his absent-minded gaze.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
These are tranquilizers. Take them
only if you feel physical stress.
Tightness of the throat, prolonged
ringing in the ears, strong headache.
Are you sensitive to any drugs?
Michael shakes his head.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
So take one at night. It will help
you sleep.
The doctor's hand puts the pills on the table, next to
the smartphone, the half-finished cup of coffee, and the
newspaper with the headline: Who Will be the Winner of
Tonight's Big Brother Competition?
The doctor's voice continues throughout
DOCTOR'S VOICE
It's very important that you drink
lots of water!
Michael stares aimlessly and is silent.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
I don't expect you to be able to eat,
but you must drink.
Is this your cell phone?
Michael nods. His automatic small movement…

6
The doctor's hand picks up the phone.
OFFICER'S VOICE
Later in the day you'll be informed
of the time of the funeral. You don't
have to worry about anything, of
course. A funeral officer will come
here around midday and go over the
procedure with you.
FEMALE SOLDIER'S VOICE
Here, Mr Feldman, drink this.
Her hand offers him a large glass of water. Michael
accepts the glass in a shaky hand, takes a small sip, and
chokes on it, coughing. The doctor's hand pats him on the
back.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Deep breath!
Michael takes a deep breath. A trickle of water drips
from his chin. His eyes are teary.
OFFICER'S VOICE
Mr Feldman, would you like us to
inform someone else? A brother,
sister, a friend?
Michael shakes his head.
OFFICER'S VOICE
Maybe have someone come over to…help?
A shake of the head.

DOCTOR'S VOICE
I programmed your phone to beep every
hour. This will remind you to drink.

The doctor's hand gives him the phone. Michael takes it
and puts it in
his shirt pocket. His gaze unfocused and his movements
mechanical.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Now try to finish your water.
Michael's hand trembles. The Doctor's hand helps him
bring the glass to his lips.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Slowly…

7
He helps him steady the glass and drink a few more sips.
Michael wants to stop but the doctor doesn't give in.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Another small effort…
His sips are small and painstaking. His lips tremble.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
It's now 8 o'clock. At 9 the phone
will beep, then at 10, and so on. A
glass of water every hour! Make sure
of that.
OFFICER'S VOICE
I'm leaving you a note with a phone
number.
His hand extends a note. Michael takes the note and
stares at it in an effort to focus.
OFFICER'S VOICE
Any problem that arises, any
question, or if you feel the need to
talk to someone, don't hesitate to
call. This line is open 24 hours a
day.
DOCTOR'S VOICE
Your wife will sleep for 4 to 5
hours. I or another doctor will come
and examine her when she wakes up.
And don't forget to drink. Even if
you're not thirsty.
OFFICER'S VOICE
So that's it, Mr Feldman, we're…going
to leave now. Are you sure you don't
want us to inform someone from the
family? Or from work?
The same mechanical, dull shake of the head.
OFFICER'S VOICE
If you change your mind, call the
number I left you. They'll help you
inform people.
An almost imperceptible nod.
OFFICER'S VOICE
Our sympathies, Mr Feldman.

8
Michael stares and is silent. His look is detached and
empty.
A few more minutes of footsteps, the entrance door closes
with a quiet click. Silence… Not a sound. Just a dull
silence. A disturbing, oppressive, deafening silence.
5: INTERIOR / MICHAEL AND DAFNA'S APARTMENT / MORNING
Vertical wide shot from ceiling.
MICHAEL, surrounded by his silent living room, remains
seated—frozen and broken—by a round dining table. On the
table lie untidily an iPhone, a laptop computer, a
newspaper, reading glasses, a half empty cup of coffee,
and pills that the doctor left. A long moment.
Suddenly he shudders and shakes off his paralysis, stands
on his feet, and in an almost automatic gesture, closes
the laptop, folds the newspaper, sets the reading glasses
to the left of the laptop and straightens them parallel
to its side, puts the cup of coffee to its right, doesn't
really know what to do with the pills, picks up the
smartphone and shoves it into his shirt pocket, stares
absently at the almost straight structure the objects
created, sets the box of pills next to the reading
glasses, and completes the symmetry.
A faraway muffled whimper. Michael's eyes focus and his
movement stops.
Another broken wail. He straightens the chair against the
table and strides slowly between the walls and the
furniture of his apartment. We continue to watch him from
the ceiling and follow him to the corridor. The confining
walls stretch on either side of him. For a moment we feel
that he’s in a labyrinth.
He stops on front of Jonathan's room. His hand grasps the
doorknob with force and he turns it with a slight, stiff
tremble. A small click and the door opens a little,
creaking softly. The dog rushes out through the narrow
opening, into the corridor. It turns and disappears into
the bedroom.
Wide view along the corridor. It seems to get longer and
longer.
Michael remains standing for a moment facing the slightly
open door, then closes it silently, walks slowly, and
stops in front of the bedroom door. He turns and
disappears into the room.
The corridor is empty. Dafna's robe still lies on the
floor.

9
6A. INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR / ABANDONED SWIMMING POOL AND
BEDROOM / MORNING
Muffled sounds. A naïve melody, like something from a
music box. Camera move. Moss and green algae climb up
cracked and faded blue-tiled walls. A row of deserted
shower stands, two cement benches, the iron skeleton of a
diving board, and children playing soccer on the floor of
an empty swimming pool. The muffled melody sharpens; an
ice cream truck slows and stops by the pool's fence.
6B.
We retreat in a slow crawl.
A dropped shoulder. A window. MICHAEL's stooped
silhouette standing at the window.
We move away from his silhouette into the bedroom.
DAFNA's feet on the bed.
We move along her body. She sleeps on her belly between
ruffled sheets. The dog is curled up beside her, his head
on her thigh. Her pale face rests on a flowered pillow.
Her breathing is quiet.
The distant tumult of the children's' voices emphasizes
the silence.
The sound of a few footsteps.
Michael drops into the front of the frame and his head is
swallowed into his pillow with a choked moan. The dog
starts to whimper and run around the bed, circling
Michael, who is trying to hold back his tears, and Dafna,
who continues to sleep quietly at his side.
Michael sits on the edge of the bed, holding his breath.
The dog comes to him, extends a paw and touches him.
Michael gives it a small, vicious kick. A kind of
momentary, sharp and unexplained burst of surprising
violence. The dog gives a small yelp of pain and leaves
the room silently. Michael stays tensed and silent.
Suddenly he slaps himself hard.
A soft, quiet sigh. Dafna stirs in her sleep. Michael
looks over to her. In one small movement she pulls away
the sheet that covers her. She extends a slack hand,
scratches a band aid stuck to her thigh—where she was
given a shot—and goes back to sleep peacefully. The
bandage is left crumpled and droopy. Michael reattaches
it to her thigh with a trembling hand. His finger stays
for another moment, shaking, on the end of the crumpled
bandage. He turns and bends forward.
Behind him the window and the gloomy sky. For a moment
the sun peeks out from between the clouds. A direct,
harsh morning light stains the curtain. The slit of light
cuts the length of his body. One part is swallowed in the
darkness of the room, the other lit up. Just a short

10
moment, and the sun is swallowed up in the clouds. Again
the grey, gloomy light, and again the echoing distant
voices of children emphasize the oppressive feeling.
A long, nagging beep suddenly cuts through the silence.
Michael shivers, extends a hand, pulls the phone out of
his shirt pocket, and looks down. The flashing screen
shows: 09:00. Drink a large glass of water.
7A. INTERIOR / APARTMENT KITCHEN / DAY
MICHAEL's hand grabs the faucet and turns it. His wedding
ring raps lightly on a glass he’s holding. Water flows
into it.
7B. INTERIOR / APARTMENT KITCHEN / DAY
MICHAEL sips, takes a deep breath, and makes an effort to
take another sip. Tears begin to roll down his face but
he doesn't make a sound. He just keeps gulping down the
water—his effort is evident. A long minute of forced
drinking and inaudible weeping, in a kind of obstinate
inner battle to not break down. He sits by a small table
in the corner of the kitchen.
His cellphone starts ringing. He gives a small start and
lowers his eyes to the screen. The word Office flashes.
He freezes and doesn't answer. After 3 or 4 rings, the
phone stops.
- A short silence All the phones on the home line start ringing. Michael
gets up with a start but remains standing helplessly for
an eternity of several rings. Then silence again.
He turns his gaze. A small shelf. Cups in a row. Their
handles aligned, facing the right. But one is slightly
off center. He straightens it in a small automatic
gesture. He looks down and sees there's still some water
left in his glass. He picks it up. A short beep rings out
from his cellphone. He puts down the glass, grabs the
phone, and looks at the screen. The words WHERE ARE
YOU?! glare at him. He picks up the glass again and
drinks the water tensely.
He sits down, takes the phone, and dials.
The doorbell sounds. He hangs up.
VOICE BEHIND THE DOOR
Michael, it's me.
8. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [ENTRANCE DOOR TO CORRIDOR TO BEDROOM]
/ DAY

11
MICHAEL opens the door. A MAN in his fifties stands in
the doorway, looks at him miserably, and says
MAN
The army called me, an officer who
said he came to see you. Michael, I
don't know what to say.
His voice breaks, he hugs Michael and starts crying.
Michael remains slack and silent; his arms hang, his eyes
are dry. Now that he can cry, tears won't come anymore.
View from the corridor. The man, part hugging part being
supported, continues to weep.
Michael turns his eyes to the bedroom. The door is partly
open. Through the narrow opening, we see part of a bed.
DAFNA is asleep, her breathing peaceful. We come closer
to her in a slow crawl. Her face rests peacefully on the
pillow. A strand of hair falls across it.
9A. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [LIVING ROOM] / DAY
MICHAEL's finger taps the screen of his smartphone.
We are in the living room, facing his back.
He stands facing a large, wide window. The phone is
against his ear and we hear an announcement.
PHONE MESSAGE
Hi, this is Alma. I can't come to the
phone right now, so either text me or
I'll call you back as soon as
possible. Bye.
We move away, revealing the city in the background.
He hangs up.
At the front of the frame we see the MAN who cried. He
sits facing a round dining table, his head in his hands,
staring forward for another moment, then says
MAN
We must tell people.
A short silence.
Michael stays facing the window and says
MICHAEL
I don't want people here now.
Silence again.
A snail crawls up the window against the grey city. We
see Michael through the window, watching the snail as it

12
goes up and disappears. The broken sounds of a piano are
heard again, but this time it's a children's xylophone.
Gloomy skies are reflected on Michael's face and he says
MICHAEL
Suddenly I had a flashback. I'm four
years old. I'm at Sarah's
kindergarten. Remember Sarah? The
teacher?
One day Sarah asked Mom to replace
her at the kindergarten for an hour.
And so it happened, quite
unexpectedly, Sarah suddenly vanishes
and instead I see Mom. Mom seats us
down and says she's our teacher now.
Can you imagine how I felt? So proud.
10. INTERIOR / KINDERGARTEN / DAY [FLASHBACK]
A group of children. A woman in her late twenties speaks
to them, but we don't hear her. We just approach her in a
long, slow camera move.
MICHAEL's voice continues.
MICHAEL (V.O.)
I was sure she was going to tell
everyone that she was my mother, but
she didn’t. Nor does she look at me.
I’m just like the other kids.
Now we come closer to a four year-old boy. He looks
upset.
MICHAEL (V.O.)
She's talking but I no longer listen
to her. I just want everyone to know
that she's my mom. And then I can't
hold back anymore and I burst out
yelling…
9B. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [LIVING ROOM AND BALCONY] / DAY
MICHAEL's eyes fill with tears. Suddenly rain falls,
flooding the window pane. The man, apparently his older
BROTHER, appears and stands behind him. He lays his hand
on Michael's shoulder and says
BROTHER
We must let people know, Michael.

13
A beep cuts through the silence. Michael pulls the phone
out of his shirt pocket and looks down.
The phone vibrates. The screen flashes:
10:00. Drink a large glass of water.
11A. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / DAY
Water streams into the clear glass.
11A. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / DAY
11B. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / DAY
MICHAEL drinks up the water in one long gulp, pulls
himself together and says
MICHAEL
I'm going to tell Mother…
His brother wants to say something but Michael
anticipates and says
MICHAEL
You stay here and start making calls.
And do me a favor. I don't want
anyone here when I get back. Say that
DAFNA was sedated and… I don't know,
I…
(a short silence.)
His brother (quietly, into the pause)
BROTHER
Forget Mother now…
Michael interrupts him and says
MICHAEL
I need some air too, Avigdor. I'm
suffocating.
Avigdor gives in and says nothing.
12. INTERIOR-EXTERIOR / TAXI IN MOTION / DAY
12A. INTERIOR + EXTERIOR
The wet window of a taxi.
MICHAEL's dull and dry gaze through long drops of rain
running down the window. He sits in the back seat. The

14
taxi drives slowly. The gloomy grey and splotches of
color of a blurry city smear the glass. The picture is
liquid.
12B. INTERIOR / EXTERIOR
The song fades abruptly, replaced by the voice of the
announcer from the cab's radio:
RADIO ANNOUNCER
It’s 10:30 a.m. and these are the
headlines from Voice of Israel.
The jingle of the news bulletin.
NEWSCASTER
Good morning.
A survey by the Dahaf Institute has
concluded that Zion Golan will win
tonight's Big Brother V.I.P.
Competition. Speaking this morning
with Voice of Israel, Zion Golan kept
his restraint and said
ZION GOLAN'S VOICE
I'm happy about the survey but I only
trust God Almighty.
NEWSCASTER
More headlines. An IDF soldier was
killed last night by shots fired at
our forces. His family was informed…
The cab driver turns down the radio and says
CAB DRIVER
I liked Zion until I saw he was
shaving his chest hair. That episode
really turned me off him. Man, you
were an officer in the army! What's
all this transvestite thing? And all
this talk about "the modern man" who
uses face cream and is self-aware?
That Russian silicon bombshell,
Larissa, really wants to get him into
bed, and he comes out saying he needs
to feel something first. And that
actually raises his rating, d'you
believe it?!
This country is going to hell, I'm
telling you…

15

13A. INTERIOR / GERIATRIC HOME LOBBY / DAY
Side of an armchair; worn upholstery. MICHAEL's
fingertips twiddle a strand of unraveled threads. A
small, frenetic movement. He sits in a heavy, depressing
lobby that’s shaped like a wide corridor. Corduroy
armchairs in brown and beige. Faded plastic flowers in
faded plastic flowerpots. The lobby is deserted. Just one
old man with a walker shuffling at the far end. A dull
thud and the sound of dragging feet. A short silence, and
again, a thud and the dragging. A metronome, but
frighteningly slow.
He lowers his eyes. Three old magazines lie on the corner
of the table. The top one is open. And old ad in the
centerfold: A clean-cut, fresh-looking ice-cream girl
smiles at him silently.
He looks back at the approaching old man, who keeps
staring ahead. The leg of the walker thuds on the floor.
A slipper drags. A bony hand. Wheezing. Strenuous
breaths. Michael continues to follow him with his eyes.
The old man crosses in front of a picture on the wall.
Michael’s gaze stops at the picture. A faded, yellowed
portrait of Herzl.
A woman's voice nears. Words in Thai. A caregiver,
talking on a cellphone while pushing an old woman in a
wheelchair, crosses in front of Benjamin Zeev Herzl. They
turn and disappear.
The old man continues to drag his feet, moving away.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Mr Feldman.
Michael's fingertips pull at the strand of upholstery
threads. He starts and raises his eyes. An Ethiopian
nurse and a well-groomed old woman.
He gets up. The old woman smiles with a loving look.
He kisses her. She sits down. He sits next to her.
Her bony hand strokes his face.
Michael looks at his MOTHER and says
MICHAEL
Mother, something terrible has
happened.
His voice is dry and his face hard.
MICHAEL
I came to tell you that Jonathan's
been killed.
She continues to smile at him lovingly.

16
Michael comes close to her face and tries to focus her
gaze.
MICHAEL
You remember Jonathan, don't you?
She continues to smile and nods. Her smile is a little
detached.
Michael doesn't give up. He takes her hand and asks her
MICHAEL
Who's Jonathan?
MOTHER
Your son. The soldier.
MICHAEL
Yes. So did you understand what I
told you?
She nods.
Michael lets go of her hand for a moment and straightens
the three magazines scattered on the corner of the table.
His face is tight. His movement small and tense, somewhat
neurotic. He gives his mother another strained look and
asks with restrained anger
MICHAEL
What did you understand of I told
you?
MOTHER
That Jonathan was killed.
She continues to smile and look at him lovingly.
She strokes his face with a trembling hand and says
Avigdor…

MOTHER

14. INTERIOR / KINDERGARTEN / DAY [FLASHBACK]
C.U. of a BOY bursting out saying
BOY
The teacher is my mom!
(silence)
The TEACHER/MOM looks at him coldly and says
TEACHER/MOM

17
Go stand in the corner.
Her voice is dry. She's not even angry: For her he
continues to be a stranger. He looks stunned. Giggling.
The piano starts again. He goes to the corner. Hurt, he
stares at the floor. A monotonous beep cuts through the
notes.
- Cut 13B. INTERIOR / GERIATRIC HOME LOBBY / DAY
View of a flashing cellphone screen:
“11:00 Drink a large glass of water”
Wide view of the deserted lobby. Michael's mother and her
Ethiopian nurse move away. Michael bends over into the
front of the frame. The faucet of a water cooler comes
into focus. He presses the button and drinks.
Dance music from the Twenties begins to echo through the
lobby. Michael turns his gaze. A wide wooden door. Two or
three steps and he's in front of it. A small metal sign:
Activities Room. He pushes the heavy door slightly and
peeps in.
13C INTERIOR / ACTIVITIES ROOM IN GERIATRIC INSTITUTION /
DAY
A wide, deserted, old-fashioned hall. The music echoes
between gloomy walls. A playback, or an organist playing.
Five elderly couples are dancing. An old man in a
wheelchair watches them from the side of the room.
A tired dancing instructor says monotonously
DANCE INSTRUCTOR
Forward, forward, to the right, stop.
Backward, backward, to the left,
stop. One, two, to the right, stop.
Backward, two, to the left, stop.
Her indifferent voice is dull. The old couples dance;
their movements are automatic. A pyramid of simple
Formica chairs in the far corner of the hall. Michael
stands in the doorway of the hall and stares in for a
long moment.
15. INTERIOR-EXTERIOR / MOVING TAXICAB / DAY
MICHAEL sits in the back seat. He presses the phone to
his ear.
ALMA (PHONE MESSAGE)

18
Hi, this is Alma. I can't come to the
phone right now, so either…
He hangs up. Looks out. The rain is over.
A blurry street through the window.
Long view on a row of grey buildings and suddenly, the
sea.
A short moment with the sea, then cut.
16. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [ENTRANCE DOOR CORRIDOR→LIVING ROOM]
/ DAY
The door opens and MICHAEL comes in.
A WOMAN-CHILD in her thirties, head shaved, wearing
rebellious jeans stands in the corridor, leaning against
the wall. She raises her tearful eyes and whispers
Michael...

WOMAN

She walks to him and hugs him, presses against his body,
demanding his embrace. There is something obsessive and
blatant in her pressing against him. Half-heartedly he
puts a hand on her shoulder. Her body shakes with silent
weeping.
From the kitchen we hear AVIGDOR's quiet voice
AVIGDOR
Probably midday tomorrow...
I don't know what time yet.
Michael looks away to the part of the living room beyond
the wall.
A 70 year-old MAN sits in an armchair. His hard face
expressionless.
Michael tries to disengage himself gently from the
woman's embrace but she presses hard against his body,
somewhat forcing herself on him. The tattoo of a snake
coils along the back of her neck.
Avigdor now stands at the opening of the kitchen, the
phone pressed to his ear. Michael stares at him. Avigdor
shrugs, as though saying "What could I do?" and says
AVIGDOR (INTO PHONE)
No, he asked that no one comes over
for now.
Michael whispers to the woman
MICHAEL
Let me go to your father for a
moment.

19

He tries once again to free himself from her clinging
embrace. She keeps pressing against him.
He disengages himself in a brutal gesture. Their eyes
meet. Her breathing is hard. Her eyes are still teary,
but her gaze is enraged.
Michael goes to the man seated in the living room. Under
the man’s inspection, Michael keeps silent for a moment
and says
MICHAEL
Avram...
The man gets up and shakes Michael's hand. A firm but
slightly trembling palm. His eyes stays dry and hard, but
with forced restraint.
Michael looks away.
A SOLDIER sits on the sofa. Skullcap, tasseled vest, and
second lieutenant bars. Yeshiva boy and officer in one
package.
OFFICER (GETS UP)
Mr Feldman...
Michael nods.

OFFICER
Second Lieutenant Israel Schwartz
from the Military Rabbinate.

Extends his hand and adds
OFFICER
My sympathies.
Michael returns a limp handshake.
OFFICER
I'm the officer in charge of the
funeral arrangements.
I need to coordinate some details
with you and brief you. In private,
if possible.
MICHAEL
Wait for me in my office, this way...
Points to the spiral staircase leading to the attic.
The funeral officer nods.
17. Interior / apartment [kitchen] / day

20
MICHAEL stops for a moment in the kitchen doorway. The
kitchen table looks like a small war room. AVIGDOR is
bent over a laptop computer, talking on the phone.
His back is turned to Michael and he's unaware of his
presence.
AVIGDOR
(in a quiet voice and dictation RHYTHM)
With deep sorrow and profound
grief... (Listens) No, without
"Blessed is the one true Judge,"
something simple. (Listens) And
profound grief, yes. We hereby
announce the passing of our beloved
son Jonathan Feldman, blessed be his
memory, who fell... (Listens) What?
(Listens) Yes, he's a soldier, was. I
mean. (Listens) Nineteen and a half.
Maybe "plucked" instead of "fell?"
Plucked prematurely? Or "In the prime
of life? " (Listens) I see. For a
soldier it's "fell"... (Listens) No,
no, whatever's customary. (Listens)
Yes, "fell in the line of duty," if
that's what's customary... (Listens)
So, then: The funeral will be held—
here the date and time—at Trumpeldor
Cemetery, the military plot,
Salvation Gate...
Michael moves away, opens a door and steps in.

18. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [BATHROOM] / DAY
A narrow, tall toilet. A black toilet seat and a small
Bauhaus-style skylight. Round, soft winter light falls on
a sink and faucet attached to the wall. Elongated
porcelain tiles that look like ivory bars.
MICHAEL sits on the toilet lid and listens to his phone.
ALMA'S (PHONE MESSAGE)
Hi, this is Alma. I can't come to the
phone right now, so either text me or
I'll call you back as soon as
possible. Bye.
A beep.
He wants to say something but nothing comes out.
He sits speechless for a long moment, then finally hangs
up.

21
Silence. He feels stuck. Doesn't know what to do and how
to continue. Suddenly he says to himself
MICHAEL
Jonathan is dead. My son is dead.
He's dead.
He tries to cry. Makes an effort, but nothing comes out.
MICHAEL
It hurts. It hurts that my boy is
dead.
(Slaps himself hard)
It hurts.
(Another slap)
It hurts.
He turns on the faucet, puts his hand under the stream of
water and turns the faucet to “warm.” The water heats up
and scalds his hand.
19. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [SMALL OFFICE] / DAY
A framed, faded drawing hangs on the wall. It shows a
complicated, symmetrical, impressive structure. The
funeral officer stands in front of it, his puzzled look
trying to decipher the architectural enigma.
Michael comes in, the officer nods. They sit in two
armchairs like those in a magazine, near a tangled
orbital drawing. Or an Escher reproduction.
Now we also see a period drawing table and a computer
nook next to a round Bauhaus-style window.
The OFFICER opens a notebook and says
FUNERAL OFFICER
Before we start I'd like to confirm a
few details.
Does the deceased have a middle name?
MICHAEL
No... Just Jonathan Feldman.
The funeral officer writes while saying
FUNERAL OFFICER
Staff... Sergeant... Jonathan...
Feld...
MICHAEL (INTERRUPTS HIS MUMBLING)
...He's a corporal, not a staff
sergeant.

22

FUNERAL OFFICER
He's been promoted after his death.
It's an privilege bestowed on all
deceased IDF soldiers.
Returns to his notebook.
FUNERAL OFFICER
Jonathan Feldman, son of... Michael
and Dafna, right?
Michael nods.

The funeral officer writes

FUNERAL OFFICER
(writes)
Michael… and Daf…
MICHAEL
(Interrupts him again)
But if he was promoted he should be a
sergeant, not a staff sergeant.
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Thinks for a moment)
Maybe they want to give him a special
honor.
MICHAEL
Why?! Do you know how he died?

No…

FUNERAL OFFICER
(suddenly stressed)
(Hurriedly goes back to procedure)

So, the funeral is set for three
o'clock tomorrow. At 13:00, the
command car with the coffin will
arrive here. I take it you know that
IDF soldiers are buried in coffins?
Michael nods.
FUNERAL OFFICER
The coffin will be accompanied by an
honor guard of six soldiers…
At twenty past one the bus will
arrive to pick up whoever needs a
ride, and at one-thirty we start
moving north to the cemetery. I'll

23
lead the convoy with the jeep, behind
me the command car with the coffin,
then you, the family, in a van
following the coffin. Then the
civilian vehicles, and the bus
bringing up the rear.
At two we arrive at the cemetery. The
coffin, wrapped in the Israeli flag,
will repose in the communion hall for
forty minutes. At a quarter to three,
latest, we'll begin the rending
ceremony in which the rabbi will tear
your shirt. A small tear, near the
heart, as written, "And Jacob rent
his clothes… and mourned his son…"
when they mistakenly thought that
Joseph had died. Genesis XXXVII,
verse 34. That's also when you'll say
your first Kaddish.
At three the funeral procession will
go from the communion hall to the
military plot. The coffin, borne by
the honor guard, in the lead. If you
want to bear the coffin you can join
in, but I don't recommend it. It's
better you support your wife…
When we reach the grave we'll start
the burial ceremony, which includes
the interment of the coffin. This is
a very difficult moment, especially
for the mother. For you, too, of
course. But after all, you know, we
are men.
Michael turns his gaze to the entrance to the room (next
to the officer and slightly behind him), the door having
been left partly open.
In the gap between the door and the frame stands the dog.
Their eyes meet. Michael gestures to the dog to come in.
The dog stays.
The officer raises his voice slightly in order to regain
Michael's attention, and continues
We'll begin the ceremony with a
three-gun salute, then we'll say "He
shall enter into peace." We cover the
coffin with soil, we say the Tzidduk
HaDin prayer, you say your second
Kaddish. Then the eulogies.

24
Michael again turns away from the officer and coaxes the
dog to come. The dog raises a paw, opens the door in a
small movement, but stays put.
In the background the officer's voice
OFFICER
(Continues)
On behalf of the IDF: the battalion
commander, Jonathan's direct
commander, and one of his company
mates, a guy named…
(Thumbs through his notebook pages and
raises his voice)
Danny Weiss. You know him?
Michael turns his eyes back to him and shakes his head.
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Mumbles)
It says here he was Jonathan’s friend
from high school…?
Again Michael signals to the dog to come to him. The dog
takes a hesitant step forward, then stops.
The funeral officer pauses for a moment, then continues
FUNERAL OFFICER
After the eulogies we'll go on to the
burial prayer, O God Full of
Mercy, and the third Kaddish.
Once again Michael cajoles the dog into coming to him.
Maybe he even whispers "Come..."
In the background the officer's voice
OFFICER
(Continues)
After which you may eulogize your
son, if you wish. And then words from
civilians: family members, teachers,
friends.
The dog relents and comes nearer, but its movements are
hesitant.
FUNERAL OFFICER
This is also the time...
Suddenly he sees the dog and recoils a little, staying
frozen in place, tense and silent.

25
The dog puts its head on Michael's knees. His movements
are still hesitant, yet it looks like a ritual. Like a
moment from a familiar ceremony. A moment in which
Michael regrets and the dog forgives. Michael lays a
gentle hand on the dog's head and strokes it silently.
The dog closes its eyes and surrenders to the touch.
Michael turns his eyes back to the officer. The officer
shakes off his paralysis and continues. His voice is a
little tense.
FUNERAL OFFICER
This is also the time to do something
special, if you wish, like read a
poem or tell a story about him—one
that tells something about his
character. Something… maybe even
something a bit amusing. A little
smile, you know, always helps to cope
and… to go on.
Michael keeps staring at him with an impervious,
unresponsive look.
The officer hurriedly concludes
FUNERAL OFFICER
Finally, we move on to the laying of
wreaths. Two female soldiers will lay
four wreaths: the battalion's wreath,
the brigade's wreath, the wreath of
his military branch, and the IDF's
wreath.
Michael is silent. A long silence.
FUNERAL OFFICER
If you have any questions, remarks,
requests…
Michael still silently stroking the dog.
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Tries to get him to speak)
I'm here to address any of these.
Michael stays silent for a moment, then suddenly says
MICHAEL
I want to see him.

Who?

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Doesn't really understand)

26

MICHAEL
Jonathan. The body.
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Stressed)
Mr Feldman, that's unnecessary.
The dog senses the rising tension and leaves quickly.
MICHAEL
(Gets heated)
What do you mean? A father wants to
see his son before he's buried,
what's unnecessary here?!
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Stammers)
I'm sorry, but that's out of my
hands.
MICHAEL
(close to exploding)
So whose hands is it in?!
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Tries to calm him down)
Mr Feldman, there are many ways of
saying goodbye. You can read
something, maybe something he wrote.
Or perhaps have us play a song he
loved. We can play it, we do have a
sound system. Or organize a few of
his buddies to sing it. You know how
it is, there's always the friend with
a guitar…
MICHAEL
Do you even have a body?
What?!

FUNERAL OFFICER

MICHAEL
I'm asking if there's anything left
of him. If there'll be a body in the
coffin or if you'll put some bricks
in there so that I'll feel like I'm
carrying something!
His cellphone beeps.

27
The screen flashes:
12:00 Drink a large glass of
water
20. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / DAY
Michael makes an effort to drink half a sip. Then he
tries to drink a little more, but he gives up. He's
exhausted.
AVIDGOR'S VOICE
You look pale.
MICHAEL
(In a low voice)
I think they don't have a body.
The FUNERAL OFFICER passes the entrance to the kitchen.
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Mumbles)
May you never again suffer such
sorrow, Mr Feldman.
He hurries out.
AVIGDOR
What did he tell you?!
MICHAEL
He refused to let me see the body.
On the soundtrack the closing of the entrance door is
heard.
AVIGDOR
But he didn't tell you they don't
have a body.
Michael is silent. He sees the obituary on the laptop's
screen.
The words "Jonathan Feldman, of blessed memory"
paralyze him.
AVIGDOR
(Realizing Michael has seen this)
Don't get stuck on this, Michael.
We're atheists, what does it matter?
Michael swallows another small sip of water. His gaze
remains glued to the obituary. He looks weak and
disturbed.

28
Avigdor glances at Michael, turns his eyes to his
computer screen, tries to change the subject and says
AVIGDOR
How did it go? Did she even get any
of it?
MICHAEL
(Returning his glance)
She got every word and didn't
understand a thing.
Avigdor seizes the opportunity and presses "Esc" but his
gesture catches Michael's attention again. The obituary
disappears and is replaced by a silly screen saver:
a photo of Avigdor, smiling and proud, between two young
boys who appear to be his sons.
AVIGDOR
(While performing his actions)
People want to come over, to give you
strength.
MICHAEL
(Stifling a burst of anger)
And what will they tell me? That I
have their sympathies?! They'll talk
to me about what a special kid he
was?!
Then they'll tell each other how
strong Michael is, how he manages to
hang in there and function?!
AVIGDOR
(Restrains himself over the sarcasm)
Don't insist on going through this
alone. This is not another one of
your projects.
Silence…
MICHAEL
Why does she call me Avigdor?
Avigdor is silent.
The phone rings.
Hello?

AVIGDOR

He listens for a moment, turns to Michael, and asks

29
AVIGDOR
What was Jonathan's Jewish calendar
date of birth?
Michael shrugs and is silent.
AVIGDOR
Don't you have an ID card of his
somewhere here?
21. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [JONATHAN'S ROOM] / DAY
Michael opens a wide drawer.
A clutter of things. Drawing pencils and crumpled sheets
of paper. Doodlings. A dried marijuana blossom in a tin
can. At the bottom of the drawer, a faded Playboy
magazine. January 1970. A Playmate with a naïve,
seductive pose. Two black Xs censor her nipples. Michael
looks at the magazine. His gaze glued to the picture. He
is still. Just a light tremor, almost imperceptible. He
averts his eyes. An ID card rests in the corner of the
drawer. Michael looks at the picture. His eyes blur for a
moment, and the card slips from his hands. He stumbles,
grabs hold of the back of the chair, regains his
bearings, and sits down on Jonathan's bed.
Cut.
Wide view of the room.
Michael pulls out his phone and dials.
ALMA (PHONE MESSAGE)
Hi, this is Alma…
He hangs up…
His finger flutters across the list of contacts. He stops
at Jonathan, trembles for a moment, then presses.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
Hello, this is Jonathan. I'm at the
end of the world right now and
there's no service here. But you can
leave a message and someday I'll
return.
He dials again and listens. Tears flood his face…
The doorbell rings. He starts, turns his gaze, and sees
the ID card he dropped on the bed. Jonathan's picture.
We see him for the first time. His face is youthful, but
the man inside show through.

30
We come closer to the picture. The soundtrack fades out
and dies. Empty silence.
The voice of a WOMAN screaming
WOMAN'S VOICE
(Screaming)
Dafna!
Michael gets on his feet with halting breath.
22. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [BEDROOM / KITCHEN / ENTRANCEDOOR→LIVING-ROOM] / DAY
A thick, opaque pane of glass. MICHAEL's silhouette
approaches on the other side. A small click and he opens
the door to Jonathan's room.
Facing him, the darkened corridor. At the end of the
corridor he sees the OFFICER, the DOCTOR, and the FEMALE
SOLDIER. He approaches them and glances toward the
bedroom. The woman is bent over at Dafna's side, shaking
her. He passes Avigdor, seated at his "war room," looking
stunned. An eternity of seven or eight steps and Michael
stands facing the three of them.
OFFICER
(Forcing a correct distance upon himself)
Mr Feldman, there has been a terrible
mistake.
The soldier who was killed was named
Jonathan Feldman, but he is not your
son. He's another Jonathan Feldman.
(Takes a small breath and adds)
You son is alive and well.
Michael turns his gaze to the living room. The 70 YEAROLD MAN cries quietly.
His phone rings. On the screen flashes the word Alma.
He turns to the living room, walks over to the large,
wide window, stops in front of it, presses the phone to
his ear and says
Alma…

MICHAEL

His voice is quiet, his face peaceful.
ALMA'S VOICE
Hi, Dad. You were looking for me?

31
The piano plays.
The sun comes out from between the clouds. It blinds him
and he closes his eyes.
23. INTERIOR / BATHROOM
A paper boat floats in a bathtub. A drop of water falls
and creates soft, spreading circles. A SMALL BOY. Facing
him, a LITTLE GIRL. Their faces in the water and their
crouching bodies immobile.
A moment of nothing. Just a random drip. Together they
pull their heads out of the water and take a long breath
that turns into rolling laughter…
24. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [LIVING ROOM] / DAY
CU of MICHAEL lying on the floor with moist, staring
eyes. The laughter echoes into silence. His head rolls to
the side. He exhales and a tear slides down his cheek.
He sees the living room from floor level. A crumpled rug
and the leg of a table.
His cellphone lies at his side and beeps.
13:00 Drink a large glass of water
The doctor bends over him. His eyes are worried. At his
side stand the OFFICER and AVIGDOR.
DOCTOR
Keep lying down and tell me if
something hurts.
Michael just stares at him with a stunned look.
DOCTOR
Move your feet, your fingers.
MICHAEL
(Stunned)
What happened..?
DOCTOR
You fainted.
Michael remains stunned for a moment, then he suddenly
jumps up and shouts
MICHAEL
Where's Jonathan?!
He tries to get on his feet, but gets dizzy.

32
The doctor and the officer grab him and seat him gently
on the sofa.
DOCTOR
(While performing his actions)
Take it slow, Mr Feldman.
Everything's fine with Jonathan.
Come, sit on the sofa.
Michael looks confused and upset.
Avigdor picks up the cellphone from the floor and puts it
on the table, opposite Michael. Michael extends a hand
and straightens it along the edge of the table in a
small, automatic gesture.
DAFNA'S SISTER
(Off camera from bedroom)
Get up, Dafna, Jonathan's alive.
(Her voice is excited and full of joy)
It's not he who died. It's someone
else.
OFFICER
(Can't hide his smile)
Jonathan is alive, Mr Feldman. And he
has no idea...
MICHAEL
(Interrupts him)
So where is he?
OFFICER
At his unit. And he has no idea of
all that happened.
MICHAEL
I want to see him.
OFFICER
We'll take care of it. I'm sure that
tomorrow or the next…
MICHAEL
(Gets to his feet, interrupts him, and
bursts out)
I want my son returned to me now!
DOCTOR
(Stressed)
Calm down, Mr Feldman. Sit down.
Tries to make him sit.
Michael shakes him off with a forceful movement and says

33
MICHAEL
Don't touch me!
The doctor recoils.
AVIGDOR
What's wrong with you, Michael? Calm
down.
MICHAEL
I'll calm down when they return my
boy to me.
(To the officer)
You killed him. You led me to believe
you didn't even have a body!
OFFICER
Who told you such a thing?
AVIGDOR
What does it matter now, Michael?
He's alive!
That's it, it's over.
Extends his hand again and tries to hug him.
MICHAEL
(Disengages from his embrace)
Why are you so sure? Because they
told you? First they told me he was
dead. Now they tell me he's alive.
Who are they, anyway?! They can't
even tell me where he is!
OFFICER
I told you, Mr Feldman. He's with his
unit.
MICHAEL
I didn't ask who he's with! I asked
where he is!
DOCTOR
(Slightly raises his voice)
Mr Feldman, listen to me. You're
having an anxiety attack.
MICHAEL
(Cuts in)
No! You listen to me! You made a
mistake!
OFFICER

34
(Cuts in)
The system made a mistake, Mr
Feldman. It wasn't us personally.
Your son’s in the Seam Zone, holding
a supply axis. Nothing operational,
just a roadblock on some side road.
The female soldier hands Michael a glass of water and
says
FEMALE SOLDIER
Here, Mr Feldman, drink this.
Michael takes the glass in a trembling hand and sips. His
sips are erratic.
AVIGDOR (MUMBLES)
Everything's fine, Michael. Drink up.
Calm down.
Michael hurls the glass to the floor, where it shatters.
MICHAEL
(Shouts)
Will you stop telling me to calm
down! I'm calmer than you are!
Silence… Everyone freezes.
Michael.

DAFNA'S VOICE

He looks toward her.
She stands in the living room doorway, wearing her
nightgown, and mumbles
DAFNA
It's not Jonathan, it's someone else.
Her eyes are moist and her smile euphoric.
Her sister stands slightly behind her. Her father goes
over to her and hugs her.
Dafna keeps smiling and mumbles
DAFNA
They made a mistake, Dad. It's
someone else.
Avigdor puts his hand on Michael's shoulder and says
AVIDGOR
Everything's fine, Michael. You see?
Michael shrugs him off. Avigdor recoils…

35
Dafna frees herself from her father, goes to Michael,
strokes his face, and says
DAFNA
That's it, it's over.
Our Jonathan is alive.
He looks at her; a tear rolls down his face. He appears
lost and confused. She gently seats him down on the sofa.
He sits. She sits next to him, strokes his face, smiles,
and says
DAFNA
It's not he who died; it's someone
else.
Her smile is happy.
OFFICER
(With some relief)
You son is fine. You have no more
reason to worry.
MICHAEL
(Becomes angry once again)
Where did you say he was?
OFFICER
At a roadblock in the Seam Zone,
holding a supply axis there.
MICHAEL
(Still heated but controlling himself)
And this Seam Zone, where is it?
OFFICER
(Stammering a little)
Near the border. It crosses a dead
area, in the northern sector.
MICHAEL
A location! Give me a location!
OFFICER
(Loses his cool for a moment)
I'm not a field officer. I'm not
supposed to point out the specific
location.
(Immediately pulls himself together)
But I'll immediately get things
moving so that your son will come
home as soon…
MICHAEL

36
(Interrupts him)
You mean you haven't started dealing
with that yet?
OFFICER
(Restrains himself and repeats)
Mr Feldman, your son will return home
as soon as possible.
MICHAEL
(Flares up)
And when is this "As soon as
possible"? Because your dead area and
your Seam Zone and all your military
mumbo-jumbo is, after all, no more
than a few hours from here.
AVIGDOR
But he can't just stop everything and
bring Jonathan here immediately.
MICHAEL
(Bursts out at him)
Stop what?! Tell me, are you on his
side or mine?
AVIGDOR
(Taken aback)
I'm with you, Michael.
(Again puts a hesitant hand on Michael's
shoulder)
I just want…
MICHAEL
(Shakes him off rudely)
Will you stop touching me! Why are
you touching me all the time?!
Avigdor backs off.
Again Dafna tries to stroke Michael's face, but he shakes
her off.
Dafna lets go but stays close.
A short silence.
Dafna's sister approaches, lays a gentle hand on
Michael's arm and say, almost in a whisper
DAFNA'S SISTER
You're so right, Michael...
DAFNA

37
(Barks at her)
Don't interfere.
(Gives her a look)
She retreats somewhat.
DOCTOR
(In a calming voice)
Mr Feldman, you're experiencing an
anxiety attack.
DAFNA'S SISTER
It doesn't mean he's not right.
DAFNA
Shut your mouth!
Avram (the father) lowers his eyes. A short embarrassed
silence.
DOCTOR
(Tries again)
Let me give you a tranquilizer shot.
MICHAEL
So you can drug me like you drugged
my wife?
(To Dafna)
You're still under the influence.
That's why you're so euphoric.
DAFNA
(Strokes him)
I know you've been through lots of
things. Even if you don't talk to me
about them.
(Whispers to him)
Don't let the demon continue,
Michael. This isn't you now. It's the
demon.
Michael grabs her arm, takes her stroking hand off him
and hisses at her in a low voice
MICHAEL
Why are you talking to me as though I
were crazy? Are you with them, too?!
DAFNA
(Almost begging)
You're always sorry in the end,
Michael...

38

Michael's eyes take on a dull look.
DAFNA
Don't disconnect now.
(She shakes him)
What's important now is that our
Jonathan's alive. Please, give it up
this time, for me.
He removes her hand again as she tries to touch and
stroke him, but she presses against him and says
DAFNA
Let's tell everyone to leave. We'll
stay together, alone, order in some
food, pizza, or a cheeseburger, with
champagne. Let's get drunk.
Michael shakes her off roughly and says
MICHAEL
You're drugged, Dafna. You're not
yourself. They woke you too soon.
He makes a effort to restrain his voice, turns to the
officer, and says
MICHAEL
I demand that you take responsibility
and bring back my boy. Not tomorrow.
No "We'll see what we can do." Now!
That's the least the army should do…
(Turns to the doctor)
The fact that I'm anxious doesn't
mean I'm not reasonable. For five
hours my boy was dead. Suddenly he's
alive, but you don't really know
where he is. So what's so
unreasonable about what I'm demanding
here? Tell me, what's not reasonable?
They are silent. Dead silent.
Michael looks at them for another moment, then walks to
the entrance door and mumbles
MICHAEL
Why am I wasting my time on you!
(Opens the door and says)
Get out, please.

39

OFFICER
I'm sorry you feel this way, but I
don't judge you, not in your state.
DOCTOR
(Whispers to Avigdor on his way out)
He's in a psychotic state. Keep an
eye on him.
They leave.
Michael puts the earphone onto his ear and searches
through his cellphone, muttering
MICHAEL
Psychotic state, yeah, right!
Bunch of impotents. Losers. Nobodies.
Running footsteps approach from the stairwell. The door
opens and Alma enters in a storm.
ALMA
(Panting)
What's happened? Dad! Why didn't you
answer? I just saw soldiers. Is
Jonathan okay?
(Starts crying)
Michael hugs her and says
MICHAEL
Everything's okay, Alma. I'm bringing
Jonathan back. I'm bringing him back
home. Now.
He presses one of the numbers on his smartphone and
waits.
He continues to hug Alma as he speaks into the earpiece
MICHAEL
Eitan, it's Michael. I need a favor,
urgently. You said you have a friend
who's a general in the army. Shmuliksomething, someone who has influence,
who can solve any problem with one
phone call.
(Listens)
Okay, so this morning the army
announced to me that Jonathan, my
son...
- Brutal cut that interrupts Michael in mid-word -

40

25. EXTERIOR / ROAD AND MUD / LATE AFTERNOON
A dark sky over an expanse of fog and mud. A narrow road
extends across the mire: a road, no wider than a truck,
that rises from the mud and is swallowed by the fog.
TWO SOLDIERS next to each other. One is sitting on the
burned, melted seat of a car. The other is standing in a
concrete gunner's post next to a heavy machine gun.
Silence. Just a click. And another click. In metronomic
rhythm, coming nearer. A skinny cow enters the frame in a
monotone gait, crosses it, and leaves.
Her steps moving away.
Again we are left with the two soldiers. They are staring
forward at a distant point. We don't see what they are
looking at, but it's clear that they’re focusing on
something.
A long look, a deep silence: only the whisper of muffled
wind.
Title on picture
Three days before
Suddenly the soldier sitting on the burnt car seat says
SOLDIER ON SEAT
Did you know that the foxtrot is a
dance?
Silence…
The soldier gets to his feet, stands in front of the
other soldier and his heavy machine gun and says
SOLDIER
The step of the foxtrot is, look:
(Takes a step forward)
Forward…
(Takes another step forward)
Forward…
(Half a step sideways, then a quick stop)
To the right and stop.
(Demonstrates again)
Backward, backward, to the left and
stop.
Grasps his gun like he’s holding a woman and starts
dancing silently on the road. The soldier with the
machine gun is his audience.
A long minute. A soldier dancing the foxtrot with his gun
against a background of endless mud.
CUT TO BLACK

41
Title: Jonathan
26. EXTERIOR / MOSTLY MUD / LATE AFTERNOON
The camera slowly moves down to the mud, then floats
above it. The dark sky reflects on small patches of
water, like scattered pieces of a puzzle. Deep silence.
Only the muffled whistling of the wind. A long, floating
camera move. The mud begins to lose its viscosity. It
becomes watery and thin, and more and more parts of the
sky are added to the reflected picture until the swamp
turns into a puddle. In the middle of the puddle we see
the reflection of a strange structure. The floating
movement stops.
We move up from the puddle until we face the structure
that looks like a concrete cube. One of its sides is sunk
in the mud and it lists diagonally in a disturbing way.
There are no windows, just a rusted iron door along the
leaning side.
A bit behind the structure rises a tall, narrow tower:
an observation platform with a tarpaulin ceiling. The
tarp is billowing in the wind like a sail, and for a
moment it seems the tower is the mast of a ship in a sea
of mud and the leaning structure its command bridge.
The iron door rolls sideways in a creaking of wheels.
Four figures come out of the structure. They're far away,
but we can recognize them as soldiers. One of them turns
to the tower and the other three cross the puddle and
come toward us, in the direction of the road. The mud is
soft and boggy and with effort they drag themselves
along.
The lone soldier arrives at the tower and climbs the
steps, but we focus on the other three. The camera soars
upward and we view them from above, vertically. A
"godlike" view. A view that turns them into pawns on a
chessboard of mud, that makes their walking directionless
and our point of view detached, cold, even a bit
condescending. We will stay with this point of view for
the time being.
Their slog ends and after a long minute the three
soldiers reach the road.
The soldier in a concrete gunner's post dismantles the
machine gun. Above him is a ragged, striped beach
umbrella: faded blue and stained white. Another soldier
comes out from the carcass of an ice cream truck. The

42
picture of a laughing ice cream girl under layers of rust
and green scum. We can now see metal barrels, rolls of
razor ribbon and a spike strip on the road. A weird
roadblock in the middle of the muddy wilderness.
The soldiers who reached the road split up. One relieves
the soldier with the machine gun. The other two soldiers
on duty are also relieved. Their movements are mechanical
and we observe from above the silent changing of the
guard.
The soldiers who were replaced leave. From above we
observe the three replacements. These soldiers, along
with the one in the tower, make up section 1.
Section 2, the one that was relieved, isn't really
important to us and will exist only in the background.
The commander of section 1(COMMANDER) stands by the ice
cream truck, raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes, and
scans the mud spread out beyond the other side of the
road.
Amikam, the one at the gun post, also lifts binoculars to
his eyes and scans around. Jonathan goes to a utility
pole, opens the control box and lifts the switch. The
light goes on. A muddy, flickery light. A misty halo of
condensation flickers in the air. He sits down on the
burnt car seat and, like his two comrades, presses a pair
of binoculars to his face.
A long movement toward what they’re looking at. No
hills, just a flat plain of endless mud, a film of fog in
the air, and the huge concrete and iron remains of an
enclosed, abandoned industrial area. Torn tin vats,
shattered smokestacks, and broken hangars, that, from our
viewpoint, resemble a gigantic ship, a moment before its
final drowning. Its stern sunk and its bow bursting out
from the heart of the mud.
Evening slips onto the mud.
Cut.
27. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK + DESERTED SITE / NIGHT
Nagging rain.
A pair of army boots in a small puddle by the side of the
road. Clinging mud oozes down the boot. A shabby plastic
sheet wrapped around a huddled figure. The drops run down
it. Through it we see stained army pants with knees drawn
together, a worn notebook held between unraveling woolen
gloves, and fingers grasping a fountain pen. Huddled on
the burnt car seat, JONATHAN is writing maybe doodling.
He's 18 and his face is boyish, but the man in him is
beginning to bud.

43
He raises his eyes and looks at the silhouette of the
deserted site that lies dark and silent amid the mud
spreading before him. He searches for something unknown
and then returns to his notebook.
Suddenly his gaze sharpens. He registers a blurry
movement.
For a moment the deserted site lies dark and silent, when
suddenly appears the short glimmer of a flashlight from
one of the sides of the complex.
He raises his binoculars and sees the dim silhouette of a
cavernous hangar.
AMIKAM tenses and embraces the machine gun.
COMMANDER comes in from the darkness and all three
silently observe the deserted site.
The sound of an electrical buzz in the air and suddenly a
bright, round circle of light falls on the three of them
like a spotlight on a theater stage. It darts to the far
end of the mud, smears over the hangar wall and wanders
between smashed windows and darkened rooms. A short flash
from one of the rooms. The spotlight darts to the window
and floods the room with bright light. A wall, stained
with damp and scum. A rotting leather armchair, and a
standing lamp with a crumbling canvas lampshade.
A radio-like voice suddenly echoes in the air
VOICE
You have entered a military zone.
Please stop before the roadblock.
28. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
Wide view. The circle of light (somewhat theatrical) now
accompanies a grey private car. It drives on the narrow
road, nears the roadblock, slows down, and stops.
The message still echoes.
29. EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) / TOWER / NIGHT
A cassette stops playing.
A switch marked PLAY releases and the message is cut off.
A hand grasps a heavy handle and pushes. It budges.
A faint creak.
The figure of RAPHAEL against the huge light that
continues to blind us. A moment later it then fades and
goes out. We can now see a pair of enormous loudspeakers
atop the tower.
30. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK /NIGHT
The headlights of the car go off, as does the motor.

44
JONATHAN turns on a flashlight and lights up the
windshield.
A MAN in his fifties: suit, balding head, well-groomed
mustache.
He's dazzled and submissively lowers his eyes a bit.
At his side sits a woman of his age, presumably his wife.
Her eyes are already lowered.
A well-groomed middle-class couple.
The COMMANDER goes to the driver's door. The window opens
and the man hands him documents. The commander looks at
the man's picture, directs the flashlight to his face,
and compares the two. Then he looks at the woman's
picture: She looks at least fifteen years younger there.
He lights her face and studies her profile. Her skin is
already a little wrinkled, her gaze submissive and still.
A long look, then he turns, gets into the ice cream
truck, and disappears.
Jonathan goes to the back of the car and checks the
trunk.
A spare tire, a safety triangle, a toolbox, a used
blanket, and a jerry can.
What you’d expect to find in the trunk of a car.
31. EXTERIOR-INTERIOR / INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK / NIGHT
A worn keyboard. Fingers type. Their movement is clumsy.
The face of the driver on a stained, square screen that
flickers in saturated color.
The ceiling drips. The COMMANDER sits on a threadbare
chair, bends over the sales counter across from an
ancient monitor, and types.
He's 21 years old, his moist face is tired but his look
focused.
A prickly beard, worn horn-rimmed glasses, dripping hair.
On the moist, rusty tin sheet behind him rest the remains
of a painted image: an ice cream cone with two flavors,
punch and banana.
At his side, on a disintegrating ice cream freezer, sits
a massive radio. Its side panel has been removed and a
tangle of wires gush out.
The radio murmurs. A disturbing electromagnetic buzz and
the wavering whine of shortwave frequencies.
MAN'S VOICE FROM RADIO
(Quietly, almost whispering)
Infrared and other special measures
indicated north of the rear battery.
32A. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER / NIGHT

45
A metallic ticking sound.
The hand of a massive iron clock closes on the hour
10:00.
A rusty bell rings briefly and sprays tiny water
droplets.
Damp flares are strewn across the wet wooden-planked
floor.
Raphael's hands grip a dripping flare and slide it into a
rifle-based launcher.
A shot.
33A. EXTERIOR / MUD / NIGHT
The flare soars and belches out intermittent sparks,
starts to whirl and dive, and falls into the mud in a
phosphoric glow, twitches convulsively like a burned
jellyfish, hisses, dies away and a cloud of smoke
disperses around it. It lies in the mud, sooty,
blackened—like a burnt can of food.
32B. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER / NIGHT
RAPHAEL's hands pull up another soaked flare and slide it
into the launcher. We see his silhouette against the dark
sky. He cocks the launcher and shoots.
33B. EXTERIOR / MUD/ NIGHT
The flare soars, its trail steady. A dull boom. The flare
ignites and a tiny parachute opens. A flickering beacon
lights up the area, like a sparkler on a birthday cake.
34. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
The light shines on the faces of the couple in the
Mercedes.
The DRIVER steals a quick glance. The WOMAN's eyes stay
down.
The COMMANDER hands the paperwork back to the driver.
The Mercedes starts and then moves away. The light
flickers on the wet road.
35. INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR / ICE CREAM TRUCK AND ROADBLOCK
/ NIGHT
The COMMANDER bends over the half-dismantled radio and
pokes around in its bowels. He turns a screw with a
gentle movement and tunes to a radio station.

46
He lights a cigarette, smokes, and listens.
A song, or rather a monologue with notes of music. A
strange, kitschy, romantic tune.
A long movement. The camera leaves the commander, exits
the ice cream truck and moves away, turns and passes
alongside the gunner's post that is lit by the dim
flickering glow of the fog light. Amikam and Jonathan are
withdrawn into themselves, listening to music. They are
silent.
A skinny cow walks on the road and calmly crosses the
roadblock. They stare at it silently. The cow disappears
into the darkness. We face the deserted site. The song
still rings out when suddenly a flashing appears from the
room in the deserted complex.
36. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
JONATHAN raises his binoculars and peers.
The room is dark for a moment. Then, suddenly, another
flash and a trail of movement.
37A. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER + DESERTED SITE / NIGHT
The sound of Gothic Rock from Raphael's earphones. He
turns a heavy switch on a control box affixed next to
him.
A creak and an electric buzz, and the giant light behind
him trembles, ignites, and lights up.
The light floods the room in the deserted site. The room
is empty, just a small puff of dust.
Raphael turns the switch back and the light fades and
goes out with a dull hiss. Its fan still turns for
fifteen seconds, then dies into silence.
Something attracts his attention. A faraway dot of light,
moving strangely.
He puts a speaker to his lips, pushes the button, waits
for a small grating feedback to end and says
RAPHAEL
The runner is approaching, repeat,
the runner is approaching.
His voice echoes from the speakers.
37. INSERT / EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
Jonathan gets up from the car seat, walks over to the
concertina wire that blocks the road, moves it aside,
goes back to his place, and sits.
Silence.

47
The noise of a faraway motor, coming closer.
A huge motorcycle emerges from the darkness, crosses the
roadblock like a intercontinental rocket, leaving behind
it black smoke and flying shreds of plastic.
Jonathan gets up and moves the concerted wire back into
place.
37B. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER + DESERTED SITE /
NIGHT.
The iron clock in the tower ticks: half a minute to
midnight.
A glass with a little coffee moves in a rhythmic shiver.
The coffee shakes.
The flares also shake on the wet wooden floor.
The sound of footsteps on the iron stairs. Small
vibrations shake the tower.
Raphael gets to his feet. His face is pale but his gaze
is hot and sharp.
A replacing soldier comes in and Raphael passes him,
nods, and leaves.
The clock closes on midnight. A short ring of a bell.
The replacement soldier grabs a dripping flare and arms
the launcher.
38. EXTERIOR / MUD / NIGHT
The COMMANDER, AMIKAM and RAPHAEL plod along in the boggy
mud on their way from the road to the structure. The
sound of a shot and the dull "boom" of the flare. The
light begins to play on the walls of the leaning
structure, and on their exhausted eyes.
AMIKAM
(While they walk)
Don't you think the room is a bit
more crooked than it was yesterday?
No one responds. Just panting and concentration on their
efforts.
39. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE - DRINKING FOUNTAIN /
NIGHT
A long tin drinking fountain: four taps over a deep
trough. A hand opens a tap. A rusted butterfly handle
turns with a creak. The tin pipes shiver and the fountain
shakes. The tap begins to rattle and whine. It vibrates
and spews air and frozen blobs of water. A long quarterminute of creaky shaking until the stream stabilizes and

48
the fountain calms down. The three remaining taps open
and four pairs of filthy hands are washed. Brown water
mixed with soap flows into the trough.
40. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE [INSERTS] / NIGHT
A can opener runs around the top of a can and opens it. A
lump of tinned meat. A thin layer of ice over the fat.
A burner lights up under a row of four cans. Fat runs
down the side of the first can and drips onto the flame.
A long, broken "tssss…”
41. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE - ROOM / NIGHT
Camera moves from one CU to another. Each soldier is deep
in his own thoughts and they eat the meat in silence.
AMIKAM, at the end of the line, eats with a thoughtful
gaze and mumbles, partly to his comrades, partly to
himself
AMIKAM
We could check it…
Wide view of the space.
A row of four folding field cots, a Spartan table, and a
heap of cans of meat. No windows; just a muddy,
flickering fluorescent lamp, buzzing softly. The walls
leak and the ceiling drips, the floor is crooked, and
everything leans to one side in a disturbing slant.
Amikam goes to the heap of meat cans, picks one and goes
with it to the slightly higher corner. He sets the can
down on its side, glances at his watch and releases his
grasp. The can rolls across the floor until it hits the
lower corner of the structure.
AMIKAM
Eight seconds. If tomorrow it takes
less time, we'll know the room is
getting more crooked.
No one reacts. They continue to eat in silence.
A long silence.
The COMMANDER glances at the screen of a plastic-clad
tablet and says
COMMANDER
Our next shift begins at eight.
Looks at RAPHAEL and says

49
COMMANDER
Raphael, roadblock.
Raphael nods.
Turns to JONATHAN
COMMANDER
Jonathan, gun.
Jonathan nods.
Looks at Amikam
COMMANDER
And you’re in the tower.
AMIKAM
The tower, sir.
COMMANDER
Good night.
No answer. He doesn't expect one.
42. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE - ROOM / NIGHT
Wide view from the ceiling. The camera moves from cot to
cot.
The sound of a video game: explosions and gunfire. The
COMMANDER is on his cot, leaning against the wall, bent
over the screen of his tablet, and lost in his game.
Now we continue and pass over Amikam, who says
AMIKAM
If we're leaning, then in the end
we'll flip over and sink. When that
happens, it'll happen in a split
second. I don't know if I'll have
time to say, "I told you so," so I'm
saying it now.
Silence.
Raphael rests staring at the ceiling, smoking. Sounds of
Heavy Metal music comes out of his earphones. He has a
pillow patterned with splashes of blood, lots of it. Like
after a bullet to the head.
JONATHAN lies at the end of the row, bent over his
notebook, and writes. His pillow has a spiral printed on
it.
He hears a faint creak and directs his flashlight to the
floor by his cot. Muffled bubbling sounds. A trickle of
murky water bubbles up from the floor.

50

43. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
A puddle. Hard rain whips down on it for a moment, then
suddenly lets up and stops.
A few last drops, and we can already recognize the
reflection of RAPHAEL.
The rain has melted the tattoo of the sea nymph with the
amputated fin and it is running down his neck. Long beads
of water stream down and turn from transparent to purple.
He looks out into the room in the deserted site. The room
is empty. Dripping. The floor is muddy. Small puddles...
44. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER AND ROADBLOCK / DAY
View of the top of the tower. Two loudspeakers against
the somber sky. The message rings out.
You have entered a military zone.
Please stop in front of the
roadblock.
AMIKAM stands in the tower, observing.
A small van nears the roadblock, slows and stops.
45. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
View of the driver's photograph. Around sixty.
The COMMANDER raises his eyes, looks at the driver and
disappears under the sunshade.
RAPAHEL opens the rear door. Boxes of various toys packed
tightly one on the other fill the van. He pulls out a
box. A robot-like soldier made of cheap plastic. It looks
like a cyborg from a sci-fi B-movie.
46. EXTERIOR-INTERIOR / INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK / DAY
CU of the keyboard, the aging monitor behind it.
The commander's hand sets down a cup containing the
remains of coffee. It sits between him and the monitor.
Through the smeared glass of the monitor we see his
fingers typing. The driver's face is on the screen.
The radio murmurs. A panel light flickers. Obscure
military verbiage in low volume, almost whispering. A
man's voice says
MAN'S VOICE
(From radio)

51
Fire control and topographical data
processing across the peripheral
axis.
47. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
Jonathan is bent over, drawing, by the machine gun.
He suddenly senses something, raises his eyes and sees
the van's driver staring at him, a direct and intense
look. An unnerving look.
A moment of locked eyes, in an effort to be direct with
the driver.
The commander returns the documents to the driver.
The driver takes his documents, one more look at
Jonathan, then he starts the van and drives away.
RAPHAEL'S hand sets the toy robot soldier on the road.
The toy soldier marches in place, raises his gun, and
shoots at the back of the van. A red light flashes from
the barrel. A moment later he shoots again, and again,
time after time, marches in place, and shoots in a
continuous loop.
48. EXTERIOR-INTERIOR / INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK / DAY
The COMMANDER is bent over the half-dismantled radio and
rummages around in its entrails. He turns a screw gently,
and then listens.
Under the electronic murmur we hear classical music.
He fine-tunes to it. Mahler's fifth symphony. He lights a
cigarette, smokes, and listens.
A long camera move leaves him.
Tracks of rain weave between the knobs of the halfdisassembled radio. A small puddle forms under it. A moth
gets caught on the surface, among grease stains and
flecks of rust. The sounds of the symphony swell. The
moth floats; its wings tremble.
49. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
A small grating sound of feedback and AMIKAM's voice from
the loudspeakers
AMIKAM
The runner is approaching.
Repeat, the runner is approaching.
Raphael moves aside the concerted wire blocking the road.
The symphony is at its climax. Now, in the light of day,
we recognize the military BMW (or some other massive

52
motorcycle) roaring across the roadblock. The cyclist, or
"runner," bent over. A tight-fitting military jacket with
a furry collar and an opaque helmet.
Screams.
Jonathan lowers the binoculars and looks up to the sky.
A flight of gulls crosses above the mud, over the
deserted site.
He stares at the gulls for a long moment.
54. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
The van with the toys comes back from the opposite
direction.
The message sounds again.
55. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER AND ROADBLOCK / DAY
The cassette rewinds and stops. A button releases.
56. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
RAPHAEL opens the back door of the van. The space that
had been packed tight with toys is now empty. Just one
forgotten Barbie doll lies on the floor.
57. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE / DAY
The Barbie doll is bent over. Her elbows leaning on
RAPHAEL'S muddy boot.
The robot soldier is pressed against her from behind,
marching on the spot and shooting. Barbie is pushed
slightly forward and it looks like he is fucking her and
shooting, fucking and shooting.
A can of meat crosses them and rolls down the slanting
floor.
We slide over the rolling can and it hits the wall in the
lower corner of the room.
A rivulet of cloudy water starts forming in the corner.
AMIKAM
(Glances at his watch and announces
worriedly)
Seven seconds.
(Turns his eyes to his comrades)
One second less than yesterday.
Wide view. They eat in silence. Just the sound of the toy
soldier, fucking and shooting.

53

CUT
With his pen JONATHAN draws a new "tattoo" on RAPHAEL'S
neck. The Gothic Metal continues to murmur from Raphael's
earphones. Amikam holds a stained shaving mirror to his
profile and shows it to him. This time it's a screaming
baby.
AMIKAM
(Drones on in his monotonous voice, while
holding the mirror)
Nice tattoo. Artistic. Full of
meaning. And message.
(Is silent for a moment.)
Tomorrow the rain will erase it. And
the day after tomorrow the sun will
melt the icebergs on the Pole, and
the sea will flood the world. And
then you can say goodbye to meaning.
And to the message. No more
message...
COMMANDER
(from his bed, without raising his eyes
from his tablet)
It'll take a little more than two
days for the sea to flood us, Amikam.
AMIKAM
I mean, from a cosmic point of view,
sir. A point of view that brings up
questions.
COMMANDER
What questions are bothering you,
Amikam?
AMIKAM
Philosophical ones, sir. What are we
fighting for here? For what purpose?
COMMANDER
I hadn't noticed you fighting here,
Amikam.
AMIKAM
Fighting a psychological war, sir.
Fighting the unknown.
COMMANDER
And who is this unknown that you're
fighting?

54

AMIKAM
If I knew who it was I wouldn't call
it "unknown."
A dull creaking sound. A folding cot lurches. They look
at each other in silence.
AMIKAM
We're sinking.
The COMMANDER glances at his tablet and says
COMMANDER
Our next shift starts at midnight.
Looks at AMIKAM and says
COMMANDER
You're with me at the roadblock,
Amikam.
AMIKAM
I'm with you till the last bullet,
sir.
Raphael moves his pelvis like an ass-kisser.
COMMANDER
(To Raphael)
Gun.
Amikam sprays Raphael with an imaginary machine gun.
Raphael throws himself on his cot and takes the bullets,
convulsing and writhing. Jonathan smiles.
COMMANDER
(To Jonathan)
Tower.
He starts his video game and says
COMMANDER
Good night.
58. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE / DAY
High view from the ceiling. Camera moves from bed to bed.
The COMMANDER is deep in his game. AMIKAM AND RAPHAEL are
staring at the ceiling. Silence. Just the pounding murmur
from Raphael's earphones.
The camera stops over Jonathan's cot, at the end of the
row. He is bent over his notebook.

55
AMIKAM
(To Jonathan)
Toss us a bone about what you're
scribbling there. Give us a taste.
Jonathan pulls himself together, smiles and starts:
JONATHAN
On the night before I went to the
army, my father came into my room and
told me a story. He said that
officially I'm no longer a kid, and
that this was his last bedtime story.
He told me about his mother, my
grandmother, who was a child when the
Nazis killed her father, in
Auschwitz, in the Holocaust. And a
moment before they took him from her,
he managed to give her a rare old
Torah / Jewish bible book, that had
been passed on in the family for some
ten generations. He gave her the book
and said that when the time came she
should give it to her son, when he
became a soldier. "And never, never
ever," he told her, "never sell it!"
That was his last sentence.
And so thirty years passed. My father
was thirteen, and the book that
survived the Holocaust along with my
grandmother lay on a small platform
in the middle of her Polish glass
case, amongst her bottles of perfume
and her jewelry. And my father knew
very well what the story of this
Torah was; that it was antique and
sacred and rare, how she had received
it from her father and that it was
the most important, precious thing in
the family, "And we'll never, never
ever sell it!". "When you grow up and
you're a soldier," she would say to
him ever since he was little, "I'll
give you the book and you will give
it to your son, that is, me.
Then my father tells me, since the
day has come for to become a soldier,
that the day has come for him to give
me the book, but...

56
Here we see waves on the picture that take us back in
time.
JONATHAN
One day, when my father was on the
way home from school he saw a new
bookstore. "Journals" it was called.
A secondhand bookstore with books and
magazines from all over the world.
Back then there weren't that many of
those yet, and my father, all turned
on, goes in, browses around the
shelves, and among the magazines
about film stars, comics and books,
he suddenly sees a red magazine with
the title "Playboy," with the picture
of a blonde, naked girl on the cover.
The January 1970 Playmate.
She had Xs over her nipples, but it
astounded him. He'd never seen such a
thing. Didn't know it existed.
She smiled at him, so he reached out
to her, like he was hypnotized, and
opened it right at the centerfold
where you can see her on a double
page, and… get this:
(Smiles)
No Xs over her nipples.
He saw her for a split second, then
the shop owner pops in suddenly out
of nowhere, snatches away the
magazine and says, "No leafing
through, kid! 75 Lirot! Either you
buy it, or you leave right now."
At the time 75 Lirot was a fortune
for a kid. He had barely five saved
up. So he left, but he couldn't shake
it. Just couldn't get it out of his
head. He didn't eat, didn't drink,
couldn't think about anything. He
just jerked off all day like a junkie
and fantasized about his Playboy
girl, this January 1970 Playmate that
he'd seen for a split second, on
Allenby street in Tel Aviv.
He barely slept at night, and during
the short times he fell asleep
momentarily he dreamed how she was
climbing into his bed, how he peels
the Xs off her nipples, X after X,
until he'd get to that point. At that
point he'd have come. It went

57
downhill — well beyond the sex thing.
He was in love.
In the morning he waited till his
mother left the house, and found
himself in front of her glass case,
pulling out the Torah. He knew he was
doing something terrible, but he
couldn’t help himself. He couldn't
control it.
He felt himself being dragged to
Allenby Street, into the store, like
a zombie. Saw how his hand offered
the Torah and heard himself ask to
exchange it for the red Playboy
magazine.
And just like it took him a split
second to glance at the Playboy
magazine and fall in love, so did it
take the bookstore owner a split
second to look at the Torah and say:
"Take your Playboy magazine and beat
it."
So my father took the magazine and
gave it to his friends, to circulate
among them, which made him king of
his class for a day. At the end of
the day the magazine got back to him
but its pages were stuck together and
there was no saving it. It was
ruined. lost...
And then, get this: My father
suddenly offers me a Playboy magazine
from January 1970, the original
magazine that he'd ordered for me
over the Internet, with the January
Playmate and the Xs in her nipples.
And he says: "Son! Keep this magazine
and give it to your son when he
becomes a soldier.
And most importantly," he said to me,
"Never, never ever, come on the pages
when you jerk off."
They laugh.
JONATHAN
I think he was a bit stoned. I think
he and my mother smoke joints from
time to time.

58

A short silence.
JONATHAN
That night I heard them fuck like I
never did before.
AMIKAM
What happened with your grandmother
when she found out?
JONATHAN
I never asked.
AMIKAM
Why not?
JONATHAN
This was the last bedtime story he
told me. I didn't want to spoil it.
If he wanted to end the story like
that, then that's how the story ends.
59.(NEW) INTERIOR / TOWER/ NIGHT
Jonathan is asleep. His head slightly drooping to one
side. In the background, the giant light is turned off
and silent.
60.(NEW) INTERIOR / TOWER / NIGHT
Raphael at the gun post. His head nods back and forth
with the beat pounding from his earphones. Amikam leans
over next to him and speaks.
In the background the ice cream truck with the laughing
ice cream girl painted on its side.
AMIKAM
(in his monotonous voice)
Don't you get the conspiracy? How
they stick to your back like leeches.
They read what you're thinking, write
down what you say...
He is quiet for a moment. He looks at Raphael who
continues to nod his head, and asks
AMIKAM
Can you even hear me?
Raphael nods.

59
It's not clear whether it's a "Yes" or nodding to the
beat from his earphones.
AMIKAM
(continues)
They're everywhere. Even here.
Watching us. Following us.
(lowers his voice a little)
You and I, for example, are being
photographed right now. Yes, Yes!
(Nods)
You heard me.
Raphael doesn't react, but this doesn't faze Amikam, and
he continues and says
AMIKAM
We're being photographed and
recorded, and if you didn't know it
until now, you should wake up, man.
Because everything you see around
here, it's all an illusion.
Even you're an illusion, Raphael. And
I'm actually talking to an illusion
here, get it? A fucking fata morgana!
Couldn't you be some blonde, like,
say, Larissa from "Big Brother?" Or
Jessica Rabbit? That Roger must have
had a serious tool. Otherwise how can
you explain this super-piece marrying
a rabbit..?
An American car emerges suddenly from the fog, slides
into the frame and stops. Amikam and Raphael jump up in
alarm. Raphael cocks the machine gun.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
(yelling)
Amikam, get away from that car!
61.(NEW) INTERIOR / TOWER / NIGHT
Jonathan sleeps.
COMMANDER'S FARAWAY VOICE
(Yelling)
Jonathan!
Jonathan wakes up in alarm and turns on the spotlight.
62. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT

60

The spotlight switches on. A circle of light around the
car.
The woman beside the driver begins to whimper.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
(Yells)
Raphael, get down!
Raphael crouches and disappears into the gunner's post.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
(Echoes through the megaphone)
Driver! Get out of the car!
The door opens hesitantly. A man in a dinner jacket gets
out with his hands in the air and yells
DRIVER
(yells)
Don't shoot at us! We didn't do
anything!
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Close your door, slowly.
The driver shuts the door slowly.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Stand next to the door!
A hesitant step forward.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Against the car!
He presses himself against the car.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Put your hands on the roof.
He obeys and puts his hands on the roof.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Now the woman. Get out of the car,
slowly.
She doesn't move; only whimpers and sits, frozen.
DRIVER
(Shouts)
Get out of the car, Marianne!

61
The door opens and a fat woman starts to get out of the
car.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
With the bag! Pick up your bag! But
slowly.
She whimpers but obeys and gets out of the car with her
bag.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
(Still off-camera, through the shrill
megaphone)
Now empty all the contents of the bag
onto the road.
Whimpering, she empties the bag with trembling hands.
Makeup, a small mirror, a key ring, and some other
everyday items fall between trembling high heels.
An ID card in a small puddle. The smiling photo of the
woman under the murky water.
Thunder crashes, the sky opens, and rain whips across the
puddle.
The woman's hairdo falls apart, her makeup runs down her
face, and the evening dress she is wearing becomes
translucent and clings to her folds of fat. Her husband
looks at her, defeated and humiliated.
63. EXTERIOR / INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK / NIGHT
High view over the commander. He types. The rain whips
the leaking roof.
From the radio a quiet male voice says
RADIO VOICE
Explosives were blasted at average
point of height from rear cover post.
64. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK + DESERTED SITE / NIGHT
The COMMANDER gives the documents back to the driver and
says
COMMANDER
I apologize for the mistake. Go.
The car crosses in front of his face and drives away. He
keeps standing on the side of the road and looks at the
deserted site. A short dark moment and again the long,
defiant flickering.
Behind him, deep in the muddy frame, the tower. The
spotlight turns on.
He lifts his arms in an X. The spotlight fades off.

62
He scans the dark site through his night vision
binoculars.
COMMANDER
(To Amikam standing next to him)
Tomorrow first thing, we won't go to
sleep before we check out that
goddamn place.
65. EXTERIOR / MOSTLY IN THE MUD / DAY
A foggy morning. A cloud has settled on the muddy
expanse.
The commander leads his three soldiers inside this screen
of fog. They make their way into the heart of the viscous
mud, with marked effort.
An exhausting minute of Sisyphean walking.
The mud softens and becomes boggy, then gives way to a
gigantic puddle.
They advance with difficulty across the puddle and reach
a broken, disintegrating fence. On the fence is a sign,
like a road sign with a generic symbol [e.g., a hand like
a stop sign, an exclamation mark, and a large X, or
perhaps a skull] to indicate danger, or no entry.
They cross the fence and go in.
66. EXTERIOR / HANGAR / DAY
[The structure that is in the front part of the site,
from which we saw most of the flashes]
They stand facing the breached hangar. They look small
and meaningless compared to its immense height and
enormous space within.
COMMANDER
(After a long moment)
We'll comb this structure, then cross
the area in a straight line to the
other end.
He looks at them. They're exhausted. His gaze is tired.
A quiet voice from the portable radio (that TATTOO is
carrying on his back)
RADIO VOICE
Decimetric fire from front line posts
to depth of mined ridge.
In silence they enter the mouth of the monstrous
structure.

63
67. INTERIOR / HANGAR / DAY
The gigantic space is empty and deserted.
Mostly puddles and ruins.
They climb up iron stairs leading to the upper level.
68. INTERIOR / CORRIDOR / DAY
A desolate corridor and empty rooms.
They walk in single file. The COMMANDER leads, with
JONATHAN as rearguard.
They split up.
We stay with Jonathan, who turns and enters one of the
rooms.
69. INTERIOR / ABANDONED ROOM / DAY
A wall. The remains of wet, rotting felt wallpaper. A
disintegrating leather armchair in a small puddle. Beside
it a shaky floor lamp. The same room he saw through his
binoculars (Scene 71b). Jonathan sits in the armchair and
presses the switch of the lamp. A dry click; the bulb
lights up but the room darkens. Jonathan shifts his eyes.
A window, partly broken. Remnants of a flapping curtain.
Outside, darkness. Suddenly night has fallen.
He approaches the window, stands in front of it and peers
out into the dark.
The glass is broken. Its crack along his face,
lengthwise. Part of his face is exposed, the other seen
through the cracked pane.
He pulls out his flashlight, aims it at the opaque
darkness before him, and turns it on and off. A short
single flash.
A moment of nothing.
A huge spotlight lights up from deep in the darkness and
floods him with a blinding, powerful blaze. He freezes
momentarily in the aura of light that seemingly tries to
swallow him. He moves to the side in a half turn, his
back now against the wall, and sees himself asleep in the
armchair.
VOICE OF THE COMMANDER
We're moving on.
He wakes up. The lamp beside him is turned off.
The commander stands in the doorway, stares at him for
another moment, then leaves.
Jonathan turns his eyes to the window. There is no
window. Just a sealed, moist wall.
70. EXTERIOR / DESERTED SITE / DAY

64

The fog is unstable: at moments it thickens, then it
thins out. A sense of lightheadedness and loss of
direction.
COMMANDER
(To Amikam)
Make sure we're on course. I want to
get to the other side, to see what's
going on there, then head back.
They look small and vulnerable as they walk between
abandoned, violated buildings. The Commander in the lead
with AMIKAM close behind him, mostly looking at his
compass. RAPHAEL and JONATHAN in the rear.
Here and there they stop and look for a moment. A huge
plastic sheet whirling in the wind. A crow hopping along
in the mud, trying to fly, fluttering in the air, then
falling. A skinny cow standing and staring at them from
the within fog.
A few long minutes of walking in the inanimate world of
ruins and murky water.
We can already see the far end, where stands a gigantic
hangar, broken open, identical to the one they combed at
the entrance to the site.
71. EXTERIOR / HANGAR / DAY
They stand at the edge of the hangar's roof and observe
through binoculars.
A long, static moment.
COMMANDER
(Without taking the binoculars off his
eyes)
We got off course and came back.
AMIKAM lowers his gaze to his compass and says
AMIKAM
Not according to the compass.
Continues to observe.
A long silence.
RAPHAEL
What's he doing there?
View through their binoculars.
They see the roadblock and on the road a soldier dancing
the foxtrot.
COMMANDER

65
We'll turn around and go back.
I'm not leaving here without seeing
the other side.
72. INTERIOR / DESERTED SITE / DAY
They go back to where they came from, glued to the
compass and the few landmarks there are.
The same crow trying to fly and falling, the same
whirling plastic sheet, and the same skinny cow staring
at them with its empty gaze.
From the thinning fog, the other end suddenly appears.
Again the same huge hangar. The same starting point.
They stand facing the hangar and the endless mud.
COMMANDER
(Looking through binoculars in the
direction of the roadblock.)
We must have gotten vertigo. We think
we're going straight, but we're
walking in circles.
AMIKAM
According to the compass, we walked
in a straight line.
A short silence.
RAPHAEL
So the fucking compass is broken!
They look crushed and exhausted. They move away into the
mud and are swallowed in the fog.
A quiet male voice comes from the portable radio
VOICE FROM RADIO
Chemical waste disposal unit on its
way to casualty collection point.
74. EXTERIOR / MUD / NIGHT
A shot.
The soaring flare is reflected in a puddle.
The flash starts and stops and the flare whirls, flickers
for another moment, and dives into the puddle.
73B. EXTERIOR {*INTERIOR} / TOWER / NIGHT
Another shot. Another flare is launched, it opens, lights
up the tower with a flickering light. Raphael stands in

66
the front of the tower and looks at the flare. His
silhouette appears then vanishes between darkness and
light.
75. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK + DESERTED SITE / NIGHT
JONATHAN shrinks in the gunner's post, under the beach
umbrella that flaps wildly in the wind, threatening to
collapse. He is drawing in his notebook.
Boom.
The flare opens and its light flickers on Jonathan’s
face.
His gaze is tired. His eyes begin to close. His head
droops and he nods off for a short moment, then wakes up
with a start.
76. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK + DESERTED SITE / NIGHT
A flicker. And another. Jonathan cocks the machine gun.
Again a flicker, a long one, and he shoots a single
bullet into the darkness before him.
Barking and whining.
The spotlight turns on and begins to dart about the muddy
expanse, in a long frantic search, until it stops on a
filthy, bleeding dog. Barking, whining, barking.
JONATHAN stares at it, shocked.
The dog suddenly collapses and falls over, tries to get
up, and falls again.
Jonathan wakes up again, gasping. His eyes are moist;
perhaps a long tear.
AMIKAM'S VOICE
You killed him.
Jonathan looks up at him questioningly.
JONATHAN
Who..?

AMIKAM

Your dog.
Jonathan directs a frightened look to the muddy expanse,
which we see from his point of view. A vague, faraway
sound sharpens and becomes a siren. A large sheet of
plastic bursts out from the dark, whirls in the wind, and
flies toward him.
He opens his eyes and awakens from the nightmare in a
panic. A heavy semi-trailer carrying a tank crosses the
roadblock, sounding its horn continuously.
Now he really wakes up, scared and glistening with sweat.
The rain whips across the road.
The sunshade threatens to fall over.

67

77. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
The announcement rings out again
ANNOUNCEMENT
You have entered a military zone…
A shining Mercedes slows, then stops. The headlights go
out.
AMIKAM turns on the flashlight. The beam of light smears
across the windshield.
At the steering wheel a BOY. At his side a GIRL. We see
them alternately. One moment the rain blurs their image.
The next moment a wiper shifts the water and exposes
their faces.
The COMMANDER approaches. An electric window lowers and
opens.
Now we can see another boy and girl in the back seat.
They're seventeen at most. Kids of good families, all
scrubbed and shining. Gelled hair, makeup; you can
actually smell the perfumes.
The commander studies them at length. The rain whips on
his face.
78. EXTERIOR-INTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / INSIDE ICE CREAM
TRUCK / NIGHT
Very close view of the commander's fingers typing; lines
of black dirt under his fingernails. The face of the girl
who sat beside the driver now appears on the screen. The
grainy image blurs for a moment and a big drop of water
slides down the screen, like a tear on the girl's face.
A quiet male voice from the radio
VOICE FROM RADIO
Sterile crushing point between seam
line and regional access axis.
79A. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BEHIND MERCEDES] / NIGHT
AMIKAM checks the trunk.
Spare tire, toolbox, and a large gift box.
80A. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [MACHINE GUN POST] / NIGHT

68
JONATHAN bends over the side of the gun and looks at the
profile of the girl sitting in the front passenger seat.
Her neck is delicate.
79B. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BEHIND MERCEDES] /NIGHT
AMIKAM looks suspiciously at the gift box, bends over it,
and listens.
81A. EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) / TOWER / NIGHT
The hand of the massive clock ticks. A quarter of a
minute to 9:00.
80B. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [MACHINE GUN POST] / NIGHT
The GIRL looks out the window and crosses JONATHAN'S
gaze.
The window is wet, and the ensuing blurring gives her a
mysterious air.
A moment of meeting of eyes.
Her friends steal snickering looks at him. Her smile,
which earlier felt sincere, suddenly seems amused at his
embarrassed reaction.
81B. EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) / TOWER / NIGHT
The hand of the clock jumps to 9:00.
Ringing.
79D. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BEHIND MERCEDES] / NIGHT
AMIKAM places a hesitant hand on the lid of the gift box.
Debates whether to pull the ribbon and open it.
81C. EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) / TOWER / NIGHT
RAPHAEL'S hands pick up a flare.
82A. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BY DRIVER'S WINDOW] / NIGHT
The COMMANDER hands the driver the documents. The driver
takes them and one slips out of his hand, drops onto the
commander's shoe and falls under the car.

69
79E. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BEHIND MERCEDES] / NIGHT
Amikam gives the wrapping ribbon a little pull...
hesitates... and decides not to open the box.
His fingers relax their grip on the ribbon and his palm
lets go.
82B. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK [BY DRIVER'S WINDOW] / NIGHT
The Commander bends down and as he picks up the document,
sees the hem of the girl's dress caught in the closed car
door.
COMMANDER
(to driver)
Her dress is caught in the door.
He gives back the documents.
Go.

COMMANDER

81D. EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) / TOWER / NIGHT
Raphael fires.
83. EXTERIOR / SKY / NIGHT
The flare soars upward and spits out an intermittent
stream of sparks, starts to whirl around, and then dives
down.
84. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
The car starts to move forward, the girl bends down and
opens the door a crack. She pulls in her dress.
The failed flare falls on the road near the slightly open
door. It rolls. Amikam closes the trunk and sees the half
open door and the rolling flare.
From his viewpoint this looks bad and he shouts,
terrified
AMIKAM
Grenade!
JONATHAN raises his eyes with a hysterical look. For a
moment he sees the girl's hand slip into the closing door
and something rolling on the road. He squeezes the
trigger of the machine gun.

70
View from high above, we're above the car. JONATHAN
shoots continuously.
The car caves into itself, a jumble of metal and glass
shards.
A last bullet echoes into a dull silence. Everyone
freezes. In the background the ice cream truck and the
laughter of the fresh-looking ice cream girl painted on
it. It seems she is looking at the bullet-ridden Mercedes
through stains of rust.
The rain washes the blood from the road.
85A. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / NIGHT
Wide view (maybe from the tower) of the roadblock, the
muddy expanse, and the road.
Orange flashing lights get brighter in the corner of the
screen.
In the soundtrack we hear the COMMANDER's voice talking
on the radio.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Cornelia from Foxtrot, we blocked the
axis all along the sector. The road
is sterile, I repeat, the road is
sterile, over.
AUTHORITATIVE VOICE
Foxtrot from Cornelia, Rhino on it's
way to you, stand by…
The flashing lights color the corner of the screen.
A huge trailer truck carrying a heavy bulldozer comes
into the frame and slowly crawls along the road.
COMMANDER'S VOICE
Rhino is entering the puddle.
The truck slows laboriously, then stops. A dull creaking
of brakes. The lights go off and the motor falls silent.
85B. EXTERIOR-INTERIOR / INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK / NIGHT
COMMANDER
(Holding the radio's microphone)
Rhino in the puddle, this is Foxtrot.
I repeat, Rhino is in the puddle.
86. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK + MUD / NIGHT
The bulldozer trembles, then starts up. A blob of black
smoke, a grating noise.

71
The monotonous sound of warning beeps. The flashing
lights on the bulldozer. The monster heavily comes down
from the back of the truck, drives deep into the muddy
expanse, and stops.
In the tower the spotlight switches on. A circle of light
around the bulldozer and the mud. The gigantic blade
stabs into the mud and the bulldozer begins to dig. A
long minute with the digging bulldozer,
The pit is already deep. The bulldozer backs away, turns,
and returns to the roadblock, loads the bullet-riddled
car onto its blade, returns with it to the mud and,
throws it into the pit.
It falls with a dull thud. The bulldozer starts to cover
it with mud.
The mud falls onto the roof of the car and flows down
around it, swallowing it more and more, until the car
disappears into the mud. The bulldozer continues to fill
the hole for another long moment.
The bulldozer packs the mud flat, turns, and leaves the
frame. Its tracks remain.
Rain begins to fall, blurring the tracks. The tracks
disappear. Only mud.
87. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
A grey morning. A gloomy sky. A supply truck is parked on
the side of the road. The driver is unloading an
impressive amount of canned meat and flares.
The noise of a helicopter. Plastic sheets fly around,
wind hits the road and a military helicopter lands. A
high-ranking OFFICER comes out of the helicopter
energetically, stops for a moment in front of the mud and
looks at his polished shoes. A moment of hesitation, then
a step into the mud.
88. INTERIOR / LEANING STRUCTURE / DAY
The room is now very crooked, truly diagonal.
The officer stands in the center. His shoes are filthy.
The commander and his three soldiers sit facing him.
OFFICER
As I understand it, you acted
according to the rules. But in war as
in war, and we're in a war here! Have
no doubt about it!
In war… shit happens. So whatever
happened, happened, and I don't want
to go into the details, because if we
start digging into them, all of you
here will pay the price!

72
He falls silent and drags out the moment, creating an
aftereffect to what he said.
OFFICER
So, as I see it, this file is closed
before it was opened. And if anyone
here has a problem with that, let him
speak up here and now.
A long, thick silence. You could cut into it.
The officer's cell phone starts ringing. He presses it to
his ear and says
OFFICER
(into phone)
Hey, Shmulik, what's up?
Listens for a moment then says
Got it. Tell his father he's on his
way home.
Raises his eyes and asks
OFFICER
Which one of you is Jonathan Feldman?
JONATHAN (who shot at the car) raises a hesitant hand.
OFFICER
(cont.)
Get on the supply truck outside,
you're going home.
Jonathan looks at the officer, wants to say something,
but changes his mind and remains silent.
89. EXTERIOR / ROADBLOCK / DAY
The helicopter takes off and disappears.
Jonathan drags himself across the viscous mud, away from
the very crooked structure.
Amikam at his side, slightly behind him.
AMIKAM
(Babbling and panting)
Don't take it to heart. It happened.
And tomorrow, as they say, the sun
will shine, and the fields will fill
with honey. See what I mean,
Jonathan?
JONATHAN

73
You mean, from a cosmic point of
view, Amikam?
AMIKAM
Cosmic only. All the rest is an
illusion...
They arrive at the ice cream truck and stop beside it.
JONATHAN
Why don't you go bullshit someone
else, Amikam. If you hadn't yelled
"Grenade!" to me, I wouldn't have
fired.
AMIKAM
(Shaking his head pityingly)
The universe is indifferent,
Jonathan. It doesn't settle accounts
with you. In ten years you'll be
floating in a pool on the roof of
your penthouse and thinking to
yourself: "Amikam was right. My life
isn't so bad. And what did I do,
anyway? He's the one who yelled
'Grenade!' Maybe he's the one who
fired, too."
JONATHAN
You're fucked up, Amikam.
(Smiles a little)
But it's not your fault that you are.
AMIKAM
(Smiles)
Hug?
Jonathan takes his time to agree.
AMIKAM
Come on, don't play hard to get.
Jonathan relents. They hug.
AMIKAM
(While hugging)
We're modern men, Jonathan. Men who
like women but aren't embarrassed to
hug each other.
RAPHAEL
(Shouting from the doorway of the leaning
structure)

74
Faggots!
Amikam gives him the finger.
VOICE FROM THE RADIO
(inside the ice cream truck)
Sterile smashing point between seam
line and regional access axis.
Jonathan climbs into the supply truck.
Wide perspective view. The road crosses the mud and is
swallowed by the fog.
The truck moves away and fades into the fog.
The soldier who opened the sequence begins to dance his
foxtrot on the road. Silence. Just his breathing and the
tapping of this feet on the asphalt.
He turns to us and takes a little bow.
CUT.
90. INTERIOR-EXTERIOR / VIEW FROM A MOVING VEHICLE /
EARLY EVENING
View through a side window of the truck. The dirty pane
is partly open. Mud and fog. The same shot as the opening
shot (scene 1) A long drive.
Camera move. We move back until we see Jonathan's
profile. He looks ahead. His gaze is dull, opaque.
Perhaps cold, perhaps lost.
JONATHAN
(After a long silence)
Do you know why they suddenly decided
to send me home?
DRIVER'S VOICE (VO)
What do I know? I'm just the driver.
Jonathan looks ahead. A narrow road and a thick cloud of
fog. His notebook of drawings is on his lap, wrapped in
translucent plastic. His hands open the notebook. First
page. A comic book title drawn in fountain pen:
TITLE: LAST BEDTIME STORY
We come closer. Now the drawing fills the frame.
91. TRANSITION SCENE: [A SHORT STILLS CLIP]

75
Changing graphic drawings that tell the story that
Jonathan told about his father [The antique Torah book
and the Playboy magazine, scene 70].
Simple animation based on a static drawing that does a
repetitive movement. Jumpy loop of a clumsy movement, but
stylized and conscious of its clumsiness.
DRAWING 1: CLOSE-UP
The dejected face of a boy in early puberty.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
Michael did something terrible!
The boy (Michael) blinks sadly.
DRAWING 2: CLOSE-UP
The face of a woman (Michael's mother from the
kindergarten scene.) Her look is opaque and empty.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
Because of him his mother had a
nervous breakdown.
DRAWING 3: WIDE VIEW
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(Continues)
...And she was committed.
Now we see the boy (Michael) standing opposite his
mother's bed in a cold, bright, fluorescent-lit room. His
mother is in a straitjacket, and stares vacantly at him.
DRAWING 4
The sound of fermentation. The boy leans forward a bit.
Something catches his eye.
DRAWING 5
The blue number of a concentration camp survivor tattooed
onto his mother's arm melts away and drips. A drop of ink
drips. Tssss... Sparkles, smoke, and flashes.
DRAWING 6
Magic effect: The boy's mother has become the cover girl.
She screams in pain. Her arms unfurl to her sides and she
tears off the strait-jacket. Her breasts are exposed. She
has two black Xs on her nipples.

76

DRAWING 7
An erect nipple bursts from the center of the X. The
boy's lips attach themselves around it.
DRAWING 8
The boy is attached to the breast, suckling. The X
detaches from the breast, sticks to the boy's face,
twists around his head and covers his eyes. The cover
girl's scream cuts off. Silence. Just the sucking sounds
of the boy. A drop of ink drips from his lips.
DRAWING 9
A high school graduation class photo. Zoom in to the
picture of a boy with an X on his face, like duct tape
that covers his eyes and was absorbed into his flesh.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
In spite of Michael's abnormal look he was
popular among his classmates.
DRAWING 10
The shadow of a beard is added to the face of the boy
with the X. He is wearing a beret, and he salutes.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
And became a combat officer.
DRAWING 11
The X stays on the face, but the beret and the officer's
insignia are replaced with academic mortar board cap and
gown.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
...and a star student.
DRAWING 12
The boy with the X sits across from a girl in a café. In
the background an ad for ice cream (the laughing ice
cream girl painted on the ice cream truck).
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O. continuing

77
...who impressed a young philosophy
student.
A text bubble pops up above the boy. Zoom in to the words
(+ V.O. of Michael):
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
Einstein said that coincidence is
God's way of staying anonymous...
The girl melts and becomes a puddle in the shape of a
heart.
DRAWING 13
An orchestra in a romantic climax. The silhouette of a
lovers couple kissing against the background of palm
trees and a sunset.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
...And fell in love with her.
Downward camera move. We are behind the boy and girl, in
front of the end of a movie.
The end.

TITLE

DRAWING 14:
A rabbi holds a wine glass. A photographer shoots
pictures. The boy, with an X on his face, stands beside
the girl, under a bridal canopy. The girl is very
pregnant.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
They married...
The groom's foot rises and breaks the glass.
DRAWINGS 15 + 16:
An office tower. Strong zoom into one of its windows.
The boy has turned into a man in a suit but the X is
still on his face. He sits on a manager's chair and
speaks into a phone.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)

78
Michael became a successful
architect..
A framed picture stands on his desk. Strong zoom into the
picture. In it, he (with the X), his wife, his son, his
daughter and the dog.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
And had a family.
He gives the dog a little kick. The dog yelps and gets
out of the family photo.
DRAWING 17:
The man, with the X on his face, stands naked in front of
a mirror.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
When he stood in front of the mirror
he saw a handsome man.
The image of Apollo in the mirror.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
He saw a strong man.
Apollo is replaced by a muscle man, glistening with oil.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
He got himself a hard on...
His penis becomes erect and he begins to masturbate and
to spurt little Xs in all directions. One of the Xs
sticks to the camera lens and blocks the front of the
frame.
JONATHAN'S VOICE
(V.O.)
And thought no one could see his X.
DRAWING 18:
A close view of the man's face. He is asleep. His head
rests on a pillow. The boy (little Michael from the
beginning of the scene) walks over the X that covers his
face.
JONATHAN'S VOICE

79
(V.O.)
Only late at night, when he's fast
asleep, Michael the boy would come
along and help him shed a tear...
The boy pulls the end of the X and peels it off. The eye
is revealed. A blink, then a tear.
A real tear drops onto the drawing.
Now we see Michael's hands holding the notebook. It is
stained. A little sooty.
CUT.
92. INTERIOR / [JONATHAN'S ROOM] / EARLY EVENING
Closed CU.
We don't see the room yet; just Michael's eyes staring at
the drawing. Silence. His face is motionless. Just a tiny
smile and teary eyes.
The distant sound of children playing enters the
soundtrack.
Wide view. Now we see the whole room.
A single bed, a naked mattress, a rolled-up rug. MICHAEL
sits on the corner of the bed, facing a wardrobe whose
doors are open. It is empty. A desk covered with a
plastic sheet. No books, no things. Just the notebook in
Michael's hands. The tumult of the children's distant
voices emphasizes the silence.
93A. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / EARLY EVENING
A birthday cake. Layers of cream and chocolate with lots
of whipped cream on top. Twenty candied cherries form
the number 20. Close view. Dafna's fingers stick
sparklers into the cherries. They look like thin, black
candles. Her movement is stiff. Her nails, bitten.
CUT TO BLACK
Title: Dafna
93B. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / EARLY EVENING
A sink, hot water, a rough scrubby, and a close view of
DAFNA's hands washing dishes. Flecks of flour and
eggshells, the whisks of a mixer with remains of sticky
chocolate.
Things for making the cake.
CU of her face. It is hard; pinched. Splotches of
exhaustion under her bitter, angry gaze.

80
She finishes the dishes, but continues to rub the scrubby
on her knuckles, opening wounds that begin to bleed.
She looks at her hands for a moment and immediately
throws the scrubby into the sink. Until now she wasn't
aware. Only when she sees her hand does she understand
and feel.
94. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [CORRIDOR AND JONATHAN'S ROOM] /
EARLY EVENING
We see the corridor from the doorway of Jonathan's room.
Dafna comes out of the kitchen at the end of the
corridor, approaches the doorway of the room while wiping
her hands on a kitchen towel, comes into CU, and says
DAFNA
We agreed you'd call! That you
wouldn't come here unannounced
anymore!
Her look is disturbed, but her voice makes an effort to
stay restrained and dry.
Michael sits on the corner of the bed, on the bare
mattress, surrounded by Jonathan's empty room, and is
silent. Silence.
DAFNA
(Choking down her mounting anger)
Why are you doing this to me?! Did
you think I'm over it? Or that I'm
lonely?
He remains quiet and looks at her.
A moment of locked eyes.
MICHAEL
(In a quiet voice)
I thought that, today…
DAFNA
(Cuts in with her cold voice)
Today, of all days, I didn't want to
see you.
A frozen silence.
Michael lowers his eyes to her hands.
With the small towel she quickly hides the wounds on her
finger joints. Small bloodstains on the towel. She hides
the stains with her palm.
MICHAEL
(Raises his head, almost in a whisper)

81
Either you hate me, or you're
fighting against what you still feel
for me.
DAFNA
(Bursts out)
Want to know what I feel? I feel
nothing! That's what I feel.
(Loses herself for a moment)
I'm bursting with emptiness.
(Takes a breath, restrains her outburst)
Don't come here anymore. Don't do
this to me.
She opens a side door and disappears with a slam.
Silence. Just the faraway murmur of playing children.
95. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [BATHROOM] / EARLY EVENING
A small bottle of alcohol. A bloody cotton swab immersed
in the clear liquid. The blood dissolves into a dark
cloud that disperses like pink silk threads.
DAFNA’s hand grasps the moist Q-tip and places it onto
one of her knuckles. She looks at the stinging wound and
sighs quietly. Perhaps just a breath: part pain, part
relief. Maybe this physical pain calms her, defuses the
rage pent up inside her. Something inside her gives in
and gives up and the hard look in her eyes weakens and
relaxes.
A quiet knock on the door and MICHAEL's voice on the
other side
MICHAEL'S VOICE
I'm leaving now, Dafna. I'm sorry. I
thought… maybe, you know, today we'd
do something. Together.
Dafna's face is flooded with tears.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
I just had to sit in Jonathan's room
for a while. And see you.
Again a flood of tears and silent weeping.
A long moment of silence.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
Just tell me you're okay in there.
With effort she controls her weeping and says
DAFNA

82
Sorry I threw away the things in
Jonathan's room.
(Her lips tremble silently, only the tears
flow)
It's because of his smell.
(continues while weeping noiselessly)
I can't bear the way things lose the
smell of my boy.
Wide view.
She sits on the toilet lid and cries softly…
96. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [CORRIDOR AND BEDROOM] / EARLY
EVENING
Michael stands pressed against the bathroom door.
CU of MICHAEL.
His face is pressed against the closed door and his eyes
are moist. Maybe a tear rolls down his unshaven cheek. In
the soundtrack we hear the muffled sounds of a faraway
television, the murmur of a laughing audience.
DAFNA'S CRACKED VOICE
(Through the door)
What did you want to do together?
Michael wants to say something, but changes his mind and
remains still.
DAFNA'S VOICE
(After a long moment)
Don't go.
Wide view over the corridor. For a moment Michael stands
facing the closed door. He then takes 2–3 steps and
passes the bedroom. Its door is partly open. He turns and
stops.
97. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [BEDROOM] / EARLY EVENING
The room is shuttered and dusky. The TV is on, the sound
is turned down. Blue light dances on slept-in sheets. The
murmur of a laughing audience. Michael is still stuck for
a moment in front of the partly open door, then comes in,
stands before the bed and looks. Pills. A half eaten
candy bar. Chocolate crumbs. An open packet of tissues. A
few more used ones.
MICHAEL looks down.

83
Dafna's nightgown lies on the floor.
He hesitates for a moment, but then bends over, picks up
the nightgown and lays it onto the corner of the bed. He
puts the tissues and pills on the night stand by the bed.
Wraps the chocolate bar and lays it beside them. Gathers
up the chocolate crumbs and balled up tissues, picks up
the remote control. Straightens up, and turns off the TV.
The murmur cuts off to silence.
97/98. INTERIOR/ APARTMENT [KITCHEN + CORRIDOR / EARLY
EVENING
The lid of a garbage bin is raised and opened. Compressed
garbage, almost overflowing. Michael's hand pushes in the
balled up tissues and crumbs. He washes his hands
thoroughly. Takes a wrinkled towel lying thrown on the
marble top by the sink, wipes off his hands, hangs it up
on the hook and straightens it with a small stretching
movement.
Something catches his eye. Four cups on a shelf. he
changes the placement of the cups and turns the handles
to the same direction, like soldiers on parade.
We leave him with a long camera move and exit the kitchen
to the corridor. At the end of the corridor we now see
Jonathan's empty room through the wide open door. The dog
is lying in the doorway. He's still waiting.
98A. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / EARLY EVENING TO
NIGHT
* End of day light enters from the window. it's the only
one lighting the kitchen and Michael and Dafna.
DAFNA's hands grasp a bottle of whisky. There are BandAids on her knuckles. She pours. MICHAEL looks at the
bandages.
DAFNA
(While performing her actions)
Don't say anything about this.
Finishes pouring, raises her glass in a small movement
DAFNA
Or about this.
Drinks deeply.

DAFNA
I know I look like a cliché.

She is silent for a moment, then says

84

DAFNA
Anyway, life is hopeless, so instead
of fighting it and making the effort
to go on, I've decided to invest in
my decline. To foster it.
If there's anything left that can
infuse some life into me, it's my
urge for self-destruction.
They sit at the table. He at the narrow end, she next to
him, wearing a simple nightgown and sweater, her hair
damp, her eyes softening.
On the counter at the far end of the kitchen sits a
birthday cake.
A long silence.
Suddenly she realizes something, sniffs, and says
DAFNA
You're smoking again?!
MICHAEL
No…
But a small childish smile betrays him.
Also in her the trace of a smile is noticeable.
She sips whisky and says
DAFNA
Okay, so give me a cigarette.
He pulls out a pack. One cigarette for her, one for him.
They smoke together, close, in silence. A long, intimate,
and quiet minute.
98. INSERT EXTERIOR / SKY VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW / DAY
A piece of sky through a double window with a worn wooden
frame and a turbid pane.
A kite dances in the air. Appears momentarily then
vanishes, hidden by the window frame and the peeling
wall.
98 INSERT-2 INTERIOR / VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW / DAY
The eyes of young DAFNA through the glass, following the
kite with small movements, and hidden occasionally behind
the window frame.
A duet between DAFNA'S look and the kite.
DAFNA
(V.O. over the picture)

85
I liked our roof apartment best, the
one overlooking the sea. Remember how
we talked all night about the films
we'd seen; how we wanted to travel
the world, study, do things?
(Drinks deeply)
The smell of the sea. And the taste
of salt…in the air.
The window opens to the right and the left.
A seagull flies in front of the open window.
A girl's hair whips in the wind.
Sea. A small sailboat.
It was an ordinary day, but I
remember that...I felt exalted. A
feeling that anything was possible.
CUT
98B. INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / EARLY EVENING TO
NIGHT
End-of-day light enters from the window. It is the only
source of light that lights the kitchen and Michael and
Dafna. The light will fade gradually throughout the
scene, evening will fall and the kitchen will darken.
The four mugs that MICHAEL straightened on the shelf.
Camera movement from one mug to the next. On the first
mug the name "Michael" under the picture of a
rhinoceros's head. On the next one, "Dafna," under an
iguana. The third, "Alma," under a black cat. And
"Jonathan" with a dolphin.
DAFNA
(V.O. continues)
It didn't last more than a few
minutes, but I felt it in every cell
in my body. And I remember thinking
to myself that…
this moment is the beginning of a
great and real happiness about to
enter my life. That I'm going to be
happy, that I'm only at the
beginning…
Dafna and Michael next to each other, at both corners of
the table.
We approach them in a long, slow movement.

86
DAFNA
(V.O. continues)
A week later I discovered I was
pregnant. I felt my life had been
stolen from me. I wanted an abortion
but you wouldn't let me. You said
that our love couldn't triumph over
that. And that you'd leave me…
(Takes another sip)
I even made an appointment for an
abortion.
I remember sitting, trembling, in
front of a doctor who explained to me
that it was too late. That now it
would be murder.
After Jonathan was born not a day
passed without me thinking that he's
here thanks to you, and that I…
(Wants to drink more but sees that the
glass is empty and gives up)
…am undeserving. We never talked
about it, but it was
always...floating in the air, my
feeling of guilt.
(Pours herself another glass and says,
while performing her actions)
Because of this guilt feeling I loved
him even more!
More than I was capable of containing
inside me.
Because there's a kind of intensity,
almost violent, in love that’s
infused with guilt.
(A direct look)
And I loved him more than Alma. This
is a terrible thing I'm saying, I
know that. Lately I'm being plagued
by terrible thoughts.
(a long sip)
I loved him because he had me in him.
Because he had in him all the things
I had in me before he was born. The

87
things that made you fall in love
with me. The things you forced me to
relinquish; and I did give them up
when I gave birth to Jonathan. For
you…
(A bitter laugh)
Any shrink would probably have a
field day with me now.
(Already a little drunk)
The approaching movement comes to a stop. An intimate
frame of the two.
DAFNA empties her glass, pours herself another and takes
a long gulp. She sinks into herself, is silent for a
moment, and says
DAFNA
Sometimes I'm sorry I didn't have the
abortion.
(Again a small pause)
Because the joy of having a child is
easily taken for granted. You don't
walk around feeling this continuous
high. But the pain of not having him
anymore is a daily one. It's
intolerable.
(Sighs)
MICHAEL extends a hand, picks up a salt cellar, puts it
back into its rack beside the pepper and straightens the
rack until it's in line with the wall.
DAFNA reacts immediately, shifts the rack, pulls out the
salt cellar, and lays it on its side. Grains of salt
scatter on the table. She moves her glass and spills a
little whisky by the salt cellar.
She takes a last pull on her cigarette and puts it out in
the small puddle of whisky.
(Pours more into her glass even though
it's not empty and mutters to herself)
Why couldn't he die when they
announced it to us? A normal death.
(Sips)
Legitimate.
(Continues quietly, but with an inner
trembling that creeps into her voice)
DAFNA

88
Why is it like a punishment, or
someone's revenge, maybe it's God
getting even with us; with you. I
mean, I didn't mean to take away your
credit, you know.
And the fact that I understand that
you didn't mean to kill your child
doesn't help me to be able to sleep
in one bed with you, to live with
you. Only six months have passed and
I don't...
(another long sip)
Never mind.
DAFNA
But I'm also to blame here. There's
no doubt. By my passivity. By not
snatching the phone away from you. By
not sticking my nails in you. By not
biting you. I lived alongside your
(psychological) damage. Pretending
not to see in order not to embarrass
you. Leaning on you in order to make
you strong, so you don't notice that
I see, see that you are weak, that
you have a secret, that you are
ashamed of yourself. And that your
life, meaning your office, us, the
car, and this "You can rely on me"
that you try hard to scatter around
you — it's all there just to hide
this secret, this weakness.
You are weak, Michael.
I saw it. Alma sees it. And Jonathan
saw it, and Max... Max feels it
between his ribs. He has a chronic
bruise there, did you know that? From
your kicks.
He lowers his eyes. A long, oppressive silence.
The tension that broke for a moment builds up again.
Dim, thin light still enters through the window. The
kitchen darkens; night falls. She raises her eyes. A
simple clock on the wall above the kitchen doorway: it’s
almost six o'clock. Michael tries to say something but
she gets up, moves away to the corner of the kitchen.
She stands in front of the cake and stares out of the
window. The last light of the day embraces her
silhouette.
Her CU
The soft light caresses her face. She looks out silently.

89

DAFNA
(After a long pause, in a quiet voice)
Want to see something? Come on.
Night falls by the moment. The kitchen is dusky; almost
completely dark.
Michael approaches from the dark, comes into the last
light that enters from the window, and stands at her
side, a little behind her, looking out over her shoulder.
99. EXTERIOR / ABANDONED SWIMMING POOL/ EVENING
Last light of day on the abandoned swimming pool. The
walls have darkened to black, but the sky is indigo.
A thin, bent man walks along the edge of the pool,
lengthwise. A bucket and squeegee. Steady steps. He looks
like a maintenance man. He disappears behind a concrete
column that demarcates the corner of the frame.
A moment of nothing happening.
A light flickers and turns on. A round spotlight falls on
the floor of the empty pool.
The maintenance man enters the frame and walks back along
the length of the pool. His silhouette stretches across
the wall. He is whistling clearly. Somewhere over the
Rainbow or something similar.
100.

INTERIOR / APARTMENT [KITCHEN] / NIGHT

The camera floats backward in a slow crawl. We are now
behind Dafna's shoulder. Michael is dimly reflected in
the window. He blends with the painting of the baby.
Dafna turns her gaze backward and says
DAFNA
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
(Smiles, slightly drunkenly)
Come on…
He is smiling again now. She picks up the cake. He pours
more whisky onto the glasses and they sit down again on
either side of the cake.
The kitchen is now dark.
Dafna's dim silhouette takes a long sip.
DAFNA
Let's devote ourselves to the grief.
She strikes a match that lights her eyes.

90

DAFNA
Indulge in it.
She lights one of the sparklers she'd stuck into the
cake. A flash of light runs along the string of
sparklers, and everything becomes one big flickering
light shaped like the number 20. Dafna smiles. Michael
looks at her and she looks at the cake. Her smile is
childish and captivating. The light dances on their faces
for a long moment, until it fades and goes out.
Darkness.
Silence...
Michael's voice, after a long silence, from within the
darkness
MICHAEL'S VOICE
I just saw the smile that made me
fall in love with you.
Another short silence.
DAFNA'S VOICE
(From the darkness)
What smile?
MICHAEL'S VOICE
(From the darkness)
The smile of a child.
A creak. Footsteps receding. A click. Michael turns on
the light. Dafna's chair is empty. Now, with the light
on, he sees a small picture on the wall at the kitchen
entrance. A crumpled page from a notebook, smoothed out.
A plain frame. A drawing in ink, a ship sinking in
endless mud. Its stern sunken, its bow bursting out of
the mud, a moment before the final immersion. The
landscape is desolate and foggy. The light gloomy and the
sky threatening.
We come closer to the drawing and enter it.
The soundtrack fades and dies; an empty silence.
Dafna sets a small tin box on the table in a sudden
movement. Michael starts in fright, momentarily
embarrassed by his weakness, but she just looks at him
with the smile of a child who did something naughty and
says
DAFNA
I found this among his things... In a
drawer.
A tin lid with the faded picture of a mermaid. A pair of
soft breasts and a fish’s tail. Michael opens the lid. A

91
dried marijuana blossom, a used packet of rolling papers
and filters.
DAFNA
Still remember how to roll?
He smiles and starts rolling.
Now Dafna is looking at the drawing. She is quiet for a
long moment, then says
DAFNA
The ship won't make it. It will sink.
MICHAEL
I don't think it's sinking; it's
stuck. But it won't make it; I agree
with you on that.
[he is quiet for a moment]
Maybe it's better that it sinks.
Silence.
Dafna watches Michael's fingers as he rolls with
surprising skill.
DAFNA
[Impressed]
Such a pro!
MICHAEL
Some things you don't forget.
DAFNA
Like swimming; or riding a bicycle.
Like the salty smell of the sea in
our rooftop apartment.
He lights the joint. She smokes, is silent for a moment,
then says
DAFNA
Like my son's birthday.
A long camera move leaves them.
A gentle breeze creeps into the soundtrack. We come
closer to the drawing and enter into it.
101. SIMPLE ANIMATION:
The ship sounds its muffled siren, starts sinking into
the mud. A muffled "bloop" and the mud swallows it. A
bubble of air bursts, a last wisp of smoke. The title THE

92
END rises from the horizon and goes out of the body of
the frame.
102. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
We come close to Michael. He stares at the drawing and
smiles like a fascinated child.
DAFNA'S VOICE
Remember what the rabbi said at the
funeral?
Michael detaches himself from the drawing and looks
toward her. Her look becomes veiled, her smile relaxed.
DAFNA
(Continues while taking off her sweater.
She is hot)
"Any IDF soldier who's killed
automatically becomes an angel."
(Chuckles)
A cute angel that the fairies fight
over.
(Laughs softly)
He's probably partying now. He's
having a…spiritual multi orgasm.
Laughter. Their laughter is quiet but relaxed.
Suddenly Dafna gets up, goes to the refrigerator, removes
an envelope stuck on with a magnet, and continues
DAFNA
(During her action)
Which reminds me, we're invited to a
ceremony at the Ministry of Defense.
They engraved his name on some
memorial wall along with all the
other...”fallen," that's how they
call them. It covers up the blood on
their suits.
(Chuckles to herself)
There’s no mud there, that’s for
sure. But there’s no shortage of
blood.
She takes the invitation out of the envelope and starts
reading out loud, interspersed with giggles.

93
DAFNA
You are hereby invited to attend the
unveiling ceremony of the name of
your son, sergeant Jonathan Feldman
of blessed memory, who fell during
the fulfillment of his duty. See, he
fell. He didn't die, or was killed.
God forbid. Fell… barely got a
scratch.
(Goes back to reading)
On the program: Words from a
representative of the Ministry of
Defense. A minute's silence. The
unveiling. The national anthem couldn't do without that! And, please
note: coffee and cake!
She sits down, stares at the cake and says
DAFNA
Speaking of cake…
She cuts the cake into slices. One for him, one for her.
They eat in silence.
DAFNA
(While eating)
Young men don't fall. Someone pushes
them.
The sound of a key in the door.
ALMA'S VOICE
(Off-cam)
You won't believe who sent me a
WhatsApp just now. Ariel. Yep. Wait a
second.
(Raises her voice)
Mom, I'm in a terrible hurry. Make me
a sandwich with something...
(Returns to her phone call)
Thinks he's, like, cool, the Man...
Crosses the entrance to the kitchen, her eyes glued to
the cellphone's screen, enters-leaves the frame and talks
into her headset.
ALMA
"Hi, Alma, I'm here at Nanochka, any
chance of you coming over?"
She stops abruptly. A short silence.
ALMA

94
I'll call you right back. Bye.
She returns to the kitchen's entrance, smiles and says
Hi, Dad.

ALMA

Michael smiles. Now his face softens completely. She
disarms him. They have a moment of eye contact. She looks
at Dafna questioningly. Dafna smiles and shrugs.
Alma continues to smile and says
ALMA
You're smoking again.
They deny with a smile. They're in a cloud of smoke.
Her smile widens.
ALMA
You've been smoking pot.
They eat the cake and smile.
ALMA
You've been smoking and now you're
having the munchies.
Want some?

DAFNA

Offers her a slice of cake.
Alma takes the cake and sits down on the free chair at
the table.
They eat in smiling silence for a long moment.
Dafna sees they're enjoying it. It makes her happy.
The dog Max appears suddenly, stops next to Dafna with a
begging look. She gives him a slice and he wolfs it down
from her palm.
A beep. Alma lowers her eyes momentarily to her
cellphone, gets up and says
ALMA
Got to run.
She pours herself a third of a glass of water, raises it
with a small gesture, says
ALMA
To Jonathan!
and downs it in one gulp. She turns to leave, stops for a
moment in the entrance and says

95
ALMA
You are beautiful when you're
together.
(Smiles and disappears behind the door
frame)
Bye...
The door closes. Silence.
DAFNA
(After a long silence)
I keep having the same dream.
Dinner on a weekday: me, you, Alma,
and Jonathan.
104A. INTERIOR / DINING AREA / NIGHT
A round dining table. MICHAEL, DAFNA, JONATHAN, AND ALMA
eat.
Jonathan with his back to us, Dafna and Alma to either
side, and Michael opposite him. We approach the table in
a long, slow movement, lose Alma and Michael from the
frame, and stay with Jonathan and Dafna. Dafna's smile is
almost imperceptible, but something shines out of her. We
see her over Jonathan's shoulder while he eats.
Dafna's voice enters the soundtrack
DAFNA'S VOICE
(VO continues)
Nothing really happens there.
Jonathan eats. Alma passes him the
salt. Things like that, normal
things. But I'm happy and don't
understand why. I even ask myself,
“Why do I suddenly feel so good?” And
then I wake up, and…
Cut
105A. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
DAFNA is silent for a moment, then says
DAFNA
And lately when I dream about this
meal, I'm aware that I'm in a dream,
and instead of asking myself
questions I simply try to enjoy it.
104B. INTERIOR / DINING AREA / NIGHT

96

The camera moves closer to DAFNA and leaves JONATHAN's
back out of the frame.
DAFNA'S VOICE
(VO cont.)
But the more I accept that this is a
dream, the more distant Jonathan
becomes. Not physically, I mean— he's
sitting beside me and I can almost
touch him. But there's this sense of
endless distance, a sense that he's
unattainable.
105B. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
DAFNA looks down at the table.
Her hand is near MICHAEL's. Almost touching it.
She says
DAFNA
That's why I never try to touch him.
I don't want to do anything that
might make me wake up.
106. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
A long silence.
Suddenly she starts crying, but not dramatically. A small
cry. Quiet. A moment shared with her crying.
Michael smiles at her. His smile is small and soft.
She smiles back at him but the tears fall.
His smile widens.
She laughs a little but also cries a little. Wipes the
tears on the sleeve of her sweater.
DAFNA
Your confession for mine?
Michael continues to smile, and says nothing.
DAFNA
(Spontaneously)
When I was sixteen I fell in love
with my father. I fantasized I was
sleeping with him, and it shocked me.
(Smiles)
Your turn!
MICHAEL
I didn't say I agreed.

97
DAFNA
You did without saying it.
Your turn.
Michael takes a match out of the matchbox, punches a hole
with it in the middle of the matchbox, sticks the other
end into the pack of cigarettes and joins the two boxes.
DAFNA
(smiling)
And in the finals of puzzle-solving
the winner is... Michael Feldman, 11
years old, who completed a 5,000
piece puzzle of Jerusalem in the
record time of...
(turns questioning eyes to him)
Six hours.

MICHAEL

Michael pulls out another match and sticks it into the
filter of a cigarette.
MICHAEL
...and one second.
(Smiles)
DAFNA
(Laughs a little)
Six hours, ladies and gentlemen. The
Temple Mount is in our hands.
MICHAEL
...and one second.
He joins the cigarette to the cigarette pack, and within
half a minute of impressive handiwork a small tank sits
on the table, between crumbs of cake, whisky and an
ashtray filled with butts. The pack is the body, the
matchbox, the turret, and the cigarette, the cannon.
DAFNA smiles. Her hand picks up the tank and her fingers
turn the turret (the matchbox attached to the cigarette
pack with the pivot made of a match.)
DAFNA
(During her actions)
Wow...
(with admiration mixed with irony)
Whenever you do anything, you can be
relied on that it will work.
DAFNA sets down the tank between herself and Michael,
grasps the turret and turns it quickly. The turret

98
completes two and some turns and stops with the cannon
(the cigarette) aimed at Michael.
DAFNA
Truth or dare?

Dare.

MICHAEL
(After smiling hesitation)

DAFNA
Of course. Okay... I dare you, next
time to say "Truth."
She turns the turret, It spins, and the cannon stops
almost opposite Michael. She turns it a little to aim at
Michael. Smiles...
Michael smiles, too and says nothing. Just smiles.
Silence.
107A. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
MICHAEL begins to speak. From time to time a frozen image
fills the screen, like a short, distant memory fragment.
MICHAEL
On the first day of the Lebanon War
we drove on some dirt road. My tank
was on the right and another tank,
Yigal's tank, was on the left.
He picks up his smartphone and sets it to the left of the
tank he built.
I was the company commander.
(turns the cannon of his tank to the
front)
Yigal was under my command.
After a few minutes the road split
into two paths. I was to take the one
on the right, and Yigal's tank was
supposed to take the one on the left.
The route was planned, and we each
knew where we were and which way
turn.
But what happened was that just
before the split I slowed down and
signaled Yigal to cut in front of me
and take my path. I can still
remember seeing him through the dust.

99

107.INSERT 1
Frozen image of Yigal's gaze through the dust.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
(VO over the picture)
I could see in his face that he
didn't understand what I was doing.
Back to the kitchen.
Michael's hand grasps the tank and moves it. The tank
turns and overtakes the smartphone lying next to it.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
(during these actions)
But I was the officer in charge, his
commander. So I cut in front of him
and got onto his path, and he got
onto mine. To this day I don't know
why I made that move.
A few seconds later he hit a booby
trap and was blown up.
Everyone there was screaming that
they were burning up. I didn't have
the courage to come nearer. I just
watched.
108. INTERIOR / KINDERGARTEN / DAY [FLASHBACK]
MICHAEL THE CHILD stands in the corner.
He is facing the wall, his back to the other children in
the kindergarten.
His face shows that he’s offended, hurt, and angry.
In the soundtrack we hear children's giggles.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
(VO cont.)
They screamed for a few minutes, and
I just wanted them to die already. I
couldn't stand the screaming anymore.
The child looks down and sees a snail crawling across the
floor. He covers it with his foot and slowly crushes it.
107B. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
Back to Michael's CU

MICHAEL
Finally they died.

Silence…
Images (over the silence)
- A bunch of cheap plastic flowers
- Pictures of the Baba Sali and other "righteous men"
- A woman, beaten and bent, seated on a stool in a
narrow, crowded kitchen
- A hospital bed in a small, poor living room
We come closer to a young man with burns on his face,
staring straight into the camera. His gaze is direct and
quiet.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
(Over the shot of the young man)
Only the gunner managed to pull
himself out, but he was burned all
over. A year later I went to visit
him. Now he lives with his mother in
an apartment block. He asked me what
happened to Yigal outside the turret.
Why he suddenly turned into your
path, that's what he said to me.
"Yours."
Back to Michael in the kitchen
I told him what I told Yigal's
parents. that I didn’t know. That he
cut in front of me. That it happened
quickly. Just like I said at the
inquiry after the war. And to anyone
else who asked…
MICHAEL
(After a long moment)
But the question haunted me, Dafna.
It was my first thought when I woke
up every morning, my last thought
before I went to sleep. Why did I do
this?! Why did I turn into his path
and send him to mine, to die in my
place? And then, suddenly, you got
pregnant. It was like a sign that… I
don't know, that God is forgiving me.
That it's over. That my nightmare is
over.
And I couldn't let you give up on
Jonathan.
DAFNA looks at him tenderly. Her eyes glitter.

MICHAEL
But you were wrong, too, Dafna. When
you opened that window and were
flooded with the scent of the sea and
thought you are going to be happy,
that you you're just at the
beginning. Because that little moment
wasn't the beginning of a big, true
happiness that was about to enter
into your life; it was the happiness
itself. A tiny moment; that's all.
109. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
DAFNA
Lately I've been listening to the
cassette full of love songs. Remember
that tape that you made for me when
you fell in love with me and didn't
know how to say it?
He smiles, his eyes moist.
She bends over slightly, pushes the button on a cassette
player that sits on the corner of the table.
Joe Cocker's "You are so beautiful," in poor quality.
110A. INTERIOR-EXTERIOR / VIEW FROM A MOVING VEHICLE /
EARLY EVENING
The song plays on.
View through the cab of the truck. A narrow road and a
thick veil of fog.
A long drive.
A skinny cow suddenly appears from the fog, standing on
the road, staring at the truck hurtling towards her.
104B. EXTERIOR / ROAD, MUD AND FOG / EARLY EVENING
Thick fog. Slow motion. The truck brakes with a screech,
skids, comes off the road and overturns. We don't hear
the noises of the crash, just the song. The truck rolls
until it stops in the corner of the screen: battered and
still.
The cow is left standing on the road in the same spot,
with the same indifferent look.
The song continues.
A dim orange sun peeks out from the fog.

102
111. INTERIOR / KITCHEN / NIGHT
The song is in its last quarter.
Michael and Dafna stand facing each other in the middle
of the kitchen, close against each other, barely moving.
Just breathing each other in, and embracing, She strokes
his head and he shrinks into her embrace.
The song ends. They stay close together in an embrace.
A long, silent moment.
MICHAEL
(In a whisper)
There's a dance that goes like this,
look.
Takes one step forward and says
Forward.

MICHAEL

Another step.
Forward.

MICHAEL

Half a step sideways and a quick close.
MICHAEL
To the right, and stop.
Now the same but the opposite:
backward, backward, to the left and
stop.
It's simple, you see. No matter where
you go, you'll always end up exactly
where you started out.
One, two, to the right, and stop.
Back, two, to the left, and stop.
They start dancing with endearing clumsiness. Michael
whispers the beat for a few more moments, then is still.
They dance the foxtrot in silence.
CUT to black.
End
