JANE EYRE

Screenplay by

Moira Buffini

Based on the novel by
Charlotte Brontë

1

EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.

1

First light. Jane Eyre is leaving a mansion house. She makes
no noise, controlling her emotions lest they give her away.
She runs across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of
her plain, black dress soaked with dew. She carries a shawl
and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder.
She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
She can’t tear her eyes away. But her need to escape is so
great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise
herself to her feet.
She reaches a stile, lifts herself on to it, lands on the
road - and runs.
2

I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE.

2

The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
down a main road.
3

EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.

3

Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
meet on a barren moor.
Jane looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
moorland for as far as the eye can see. She comes to a halt,
objectless, lost, alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around
her. She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into
the gathering dark.
4

EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.

4

Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night
sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying
to calm herself with a prayer.
She gives way to her emotion.
5

EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun,
numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock,
mesmerised.

EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF A MOOR.

Jane is huddled under a wall. She is shaking, shuddering. The
life has gone out of her eyes. Jane suddenly turns, as if
unable to bear her thoughts. She staggers away.

EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.

12

Dark clouds. It is pouring with rain. Jane is struggling
through a marsh. She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her
face pressed against the earth. She doesn’t move. She has
reached the point of despair.
13

EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.

13

Jane is toiling through the lashing rain. A brief flash of
lightning shows her a low stone cottage.
Jane knocks at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers. She
is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch. She cannot find her
voice.
HANNAH
I can't take in vagrants. You can move
off. And if there are others with you
tell them we are not alone. We have a
gentleman here, and dogs.
But -

JANE

The door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail. She turns
away, her hope gone, towards the darkness.
JANE (CONT'D)
God help me. I will die.
As she collapses, she finds herself supported by a strong
pair of black-clad arms.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 3.

She is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face of
St John Rivers. He carries her over the threshold into the
warmth of Moor House.
14

INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN.

14

A fire is roaring in the stove. St John sets Jane down before
the hearth. Diana and Mary enter.
St John?

DIANA

ST JOHN
I found her at the door.
MARY
She’s white as death.
HANNAH
(guiltily)
I thought her one of the gypsies from
the cross.
Jane can hold herself up no longer. Diana and St John help
her into a chair. The rain hammers on the windows.
DIANA
Hannah, some of that hot milk.
MARY
St John, we would have stumbled upon
her corpse in the morning. And she
would have haunted us for turning her
away ST JOHN
She’s no vagrant; I’m sure of it.
HANNAH
There’s milk for you.
Jane tries to mouth her thanks. She sips the milk. Diana
kneels at her side.
ST JOHN
Ask her her name.
JANE
I - I am J Jane cannot speak. She’s incapable of uttering her own name.
She hears John Reed’s voice calling from far away.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 4.

Jane Eyre!

JOHN REED (O.S.)

ST JOHN
Tell us how we may help you.
DIANA
Your name?...
Jane is deeply troubled. She is losing consciousness. She
sees a frightened girl of ten holding a book, running from
the cosy kitchen, down the dark corridor into the heart of
the house. Jane turns her head to follow her.
JOHN REED (O.S.)
Jane Eyre! Where are you?
Jane looks up at St John Rivers, imploring.
JANE
Must hide...
She passes out.
15

INT. DAY. GATESHEAD HOUSE.

15

The small girl - Jane, aged ten - races down a long, dark
corridor, clutching the precious book. Heavy footsteps pound
closely behind her.
JOHN REED (O.S.)
Where are you, rat?
Jane races on. She enters the gloomy, cold library and
springs behind a curtain, drawing it shut. John Reed enters;
fourteen years old. He is holding a sword.
JOHN REED (CONT'D)
I know you’re here.
Jane watches him pass by her. He practises a lunge.
JOHN REED (CONT'D)
If you crawl out and say ‘Forgive me,
Master Reed,’ I might consider it.
We follow him as he enters a large adjoining room. We briefly
see Mrs Reed and her two daughters, Georgiana and Eliza;
girls slightly older than Jane. They are playing ‘I love my
love’.
Behind the curtain, Jane breathes a sigh of relief in her
private sanctuary.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 5.

Jane opens the book. It is full of beautifully drawn birds.
She runs her fingers over the lines of the drawing.
DIANA (V.O)
St John, we must get her warm.
ST JOHN (V.O.)
Let us take her upstairs.
MARY (V.O.)
Will she die?
The curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in front of her.
Jane shrinks back, using the book for protection.
JOHN REED
(Grabbing the book)
That belongs to me, rat.
JANE
It belongs to my Uncle Reed.
He senses her defiance and belts her with the book. Jane hits
her head on the window clasp, drawing blood.
Something in Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the
rage in her released. She is barely coherent.
JANE (CONT'D)
I hate you John Reed. I hate you John is flabbergasted. Like all bullies, he is terrified.
JOHN
Mamma! Mamma!
Jane bites him, literally pulls on the skin of his cheek with
her teeth. She virtually draws blood. He screams. Others
arrive on the scene.
MISS ABBOT
For shame! She bites!
We see Mrs Reed’s shocked face - her daughters at her side.
She’s a woman not yet forty in a bright, elaborate dress once a great beauty and still proud of it.
She pulls Jane off John by her hair and holds her.
MRS REED
You wretched imp.
(To Bessie and Miss Abbot)
Take her to the red room and lock her
there.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 6.

We see a look of shock in Bessie’s eyes. Jane resists with
all her strength.
16

INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - CORRIDOR / THE RED ROOM.

16

Jane is carried struggling down the corridor by Miss Abbot
and Bessie - one at each side of her. Her shouts of
resistance shatter the quiet.
They open the door of a large cold room, the sudden drop in
temperature making their breath vapourise. Jane resists even
more furiously when she realises where she is.
JANE
No! NO! It is HAUNTED!
MISS ABBOT
If you don't sit still you must be
tied down!
The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie, young
and bonny, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She has some
compassion. Miss Abbot has none.
BESSIE
What we do is for your own good. If
you are passionate and rude like this,
your Aunt Reed will send you away.
MISS ABBOT
Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or
something bad will come down that
chimney and fetch you away.
The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge of
the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and curtains,
murky in the fading light.
In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
Jane bangs the door in her panic and distress, hysterically
glancing at the fireplace. She hears something; a noise in it
- something coming to fetch her away.
There’s a fall of soot in the chimney, a cloud of black from
the gaping mouth. Something is coming for her. Jane hurls
herself against the door, hitting her head. She falls back.
Jane lies unconscious in a pool of ghostly light.

INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM.

19

A bright morning. A clergyman dressed in black is staring
down at Jane. Brockelhurst, pious hypocrite, ambassador of
self-denial, epitome of grim.
BROCKLEHURST
Do you know, Jane Eyre, where the
wicked go after death?
JANE
They go to hell.
BROCKLEHURST
And what is hell?
JANE
A pit full of fire.
BROCKLEHURST
Should you like to fall into that pit
and burn there forever?
No sir.

JANE

BROCKLEHURST
What must you do to avoid it?
JANE
I must keep in good health and
not die.
Mrs Reed is by the fireside in an ultra-feminine dress. She
puts down her tea cup in irritation.
BROCKLEHURST
What’s her parentage?
MRS REED
She’s an orphan. Her mother was my
husband’s sister. On his deathbed he
exhorted me to care for her. I have
always treated her as one of my own...
Jane silently revolts against this lie.
MRS REED (CONT'D)
If you accept her at Lowood school Mr
Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye on
her.
(MORE)

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 8.
MRS REED (CONT'D)
She has a heart of spite and I’m sorry
to tell you that her worst fault is
that of deceit.

Jane's eyes flash with outrage.
BROCKLEHURST
You can rest assured dear lady that we
shall root out the wickedness in this
small, ungrateful plant.
A passion of resentment is forming in Jane. Mrs Reed smiles
sweetly.
MRS REED
And as for its vacations, it must
spend them all at Lowood.
A manservant enters with Brockelhurst’s hat and coat.
Brockelhurst bows to Mrs Reed and takes his leave. The
manservant closes the door.
JANE
You said I was a liar. I am not. If I
were I should say that I loved you and
I don’t. People think you are good but
you’re bad and hard-hearted. I'll let
everyone know what you have done.
MRS REED
Children must be corrected for their
faults.
JANE
Deceit is not my fault.
MRS REED
But you are passionate.
JANE
My Uncle Reed is in heaven, so are my
mother and father. They know how you
hate me and wish me dead. They can
see. They see everything you do and
they will judge you, Mrs Reed.
Mrs Reed has turned quite pale. Jane blazes.
Get out.

Jane, barely awake, is lifted out of a coach and into a thick
fog. A stone inscription looms at her: ‘Lowood Institution’.
Great gates close behind her.
A woman with a bitter look approaches; Miss Scatcherd.
MISS SCATCHERD
What’s your name, child?
25A

INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - DORMITORY.

25A

Jane is standing in the dormitory of the school in her
travelling clothes. A long room in which each bed sleeps two
girls. By the inadequate, smoky rushlight (for candles are
too expensive) Jane can see that it is full of pale, brownclad girls. Their clothes are patched and worn. They huddle
round the fire. They look cold, submissive and half-starved.
None of them looks friendly. This is a dumping ground for the
unwanted. The poverty appalls her.
The girls stare at Jane in her warm clothes and good shoes,
as if she comes from a different world.
MISS SCATCHERD
Step out of your fine clothes.
Miss Scatcherd helps Jane off with her clothes. They drop to
her feet; her old life being discarded.

Jane is lying back against clean white pillows.
JANE
My name is Jane Elliott...
Diana and Mary are full of kindness but St John’s face is
merely curious.
ST JOHN
Who can we send for to help you?
No one.

JANE

ST JOHN
Do you mean to say that you are
absolutely without home and without
friends?
Yes sir.

JANE

ST JOHN
How did you come to be roaming the
moors, Miss Elliott?
The name sounds strange to Jane. St John is exasperated.
ST JOHN (CONT’D)
Miss Elliott?
JANE
That is not my name.
DIANA
You haven’t given us your real name?
Jane shakes her head.
Why not?

ST JOHN

JANE
I mustn’t ever be found.
Diana and Mary glance at each other, fascinated.
27

INT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE BEDROOM

27

Jane is dressing herself. She stops, weakly holding the back
of a chair for support, looking out of the window at the sun
setting over the hills.

ST JOHN
Join me to thyself with an inseparable
band of love. For thou, even thou
alone, dost satisfy him that loveth
thee...
Jane finds herself staring at St John.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
And without thee all things are vain
and empty. Amen.
St John opens his eyes. Jane immediately looks down.
Amen.

JANE, MARY, DIANA

INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE. PARLOUR - 10 MINUTES LATER.
They are eating.
MARY
It’s wonderful to see you up, Miss
Elliott. Last week we thought we’d be
escorting your remains to an unmarked
grave.
DIANA
She read ‘The Bride of Lindorf’ and
suddenly all is woebegone maidens and
dramatic deaths.
JANE
I’m sorry to have caused you so much
trouble
Nonsense.

DIANA

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 12.

MARY
You’re the most exciting thing that’s
happened here since St John’s sermon
on the Fall of Babylon.
Jane is amused. She turns her attention to St John.
JANE
I hope I’ll not be eating long at your
expense, Mr Rivers.
ST JOHN
Then tell me where to place you.
JANE
Show me where to seek work; that’s all
I ask.
MARY
You’re not fit enough to work. Is she,
Di?
DIANA
Stay with us.
ST JOHN
You return to your posts at the end of
the month. What must Miss Elliott do
then?
(To Jane)
I’ll endeavour to help you, if that’s
what you wish.
JANE
With all my heart, sir.
ST JOHN
This school you were at, Miss Elliot,
this charitable institution; what did
it prepare you for?
CUT TO:
We see a bundle of sharp twigs come down on a girl’s bare
neck, like a whip.

Jane flinches at the memory.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
Was it a thorough education?

JANE
Most thorough.

INT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL.

31

Once more, the twigs come down on the bare neck. We now see
that the neck belongs to Helen Burns, a red-haired
Northumbrian girl of thirteen. Jane, along with the rest of
the school, is watching the punishment, aghast.
Burns.

MISS SCATCHERD

Miss Scatcherd’s bitter life is in her face and voice.
MISS SCATCHERD (CONT'D)
You’re a slattern and a disgrace.
The punishment is continued; slow, stinging whacks with the
birch twigs, three, four, five. Jane is appalled. But Helen
doesn't cry; she seems like one in a trance.
Helen shows great fortitude, as if an inner strength is
helping her endure. It is deeply impressive to Jane.

EXT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE GROUNDS

33

The girls are outside in the freezing cold. Snow lies in
patches. Their shoes are soaked and grey frieze cloaks are
completely inadequate. A few girls huddle by the building,
trying to stay out of the biting wind. Jane stands alone. Icy
water seeps on her feet.
She sees Helen seated, her cloak wrapped tightly around her,
head deep in a book. She approaches.
JANE
How do you bear being struck?
HELEN
Miss Scatcherd hits me to improve me.
She’s tormented by my faults.
JANE
If she hit me I’d get that birch and
break it under her nose.
HELEN
She’d find another soon enough.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 14.

Helen perceives the passion in Jane’s expression.
HELEN (CONT’D)
My father used to preach that life is
too short to spend in nursing
animosity.
JANE
At my aunt’s house I was solitary and
despised. She thought I could do
without one bit of love or kindness
but how can we live so?
HELEN
You are loved...
Helen, compassionate, beckons Jane to sit with her.

HELEN (CONT’D)
There is an invisible world all around
you, a kingdom of spirits commissioned
to guard you. Do you not see them?
Jane looks through the air for them, intrigued.
34

INT. DAY. LOWOOD SCHOOL - THE HALL.

34

Snow is falling outside the window. The afternoon’s lessons
are in progress. The girls are divided into groups. Madame
Pierrot is teaching French verbs. The younger girls repeat
Etre in a motley chant.
Mr Brocklehurst is watching, approving. Miss Scatcherd’s
shrill voice suddenly pierces the calm.
MISS SCATCHERD
Burns! I will not have you before me
in that attitude. Fetch the birch.
Jane stands involuntarily, letting her slate fall. It breaks
on the floor. Brocklehurst's eyes land on her.
BROCKLEHURST
The new girl. Step forward, Jane Eyre.
Jane steps forward.
BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
Bring forth that stool. Place the
child upon it.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 15.

Jane is lifted on to the stool. She finds herself suddenly
the tallest in the room, looking down even on Brocklehurst.
He is in deadly earnest.
BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
It is my duty to warn you about this
girl. Who would have thought that the
evil one had already found a servant
and an agent in her?
We see the look of frustration on Miss Temple's face.
BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
You must be on guard against her. For
this girl... is a liar!
Jane burns with injustice. A terrible shame overcomes her.
But she meets Helen’s eye. She remembers the lesson of
fortitude. She remembers the spirits who guard her. As
Brocklehurst continues, she gathers strength.
BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
This is the pedestal of infamy - and
you must remain upon it all day long.
You’ll have no food or drink, for you
must learn how barren is the life of
the sinner. Children, I exhort you to
shun her, exclude her, shut her out
from this day forth. Withhold the hand
of friendship and deny your love to
Jane Eyre, the liar.

The sun is setting. The girls are filing past the small
figure of Jane with their meagre suppers. She is still high
on her stool. Her exhaustion is beginning to break her.
As Helen Burns passes her, she pushes a piece of bread into
Jane’s hand. This tiny act of kindness brings the tears
welling up in Jane’s eyes.

Jane climbs into bed next to Helen. For a moment they just
hold each other.
HELEN (CONT’D)
I am happy, Jane. I’m going home.
JANE
Back to your father?
HELEN
To my last home, where all is light. I
am going to God.
Jane is devastated.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Don’t be sad. You have a passion for
living, Jane. And one day you will
come to the region of bliss...
Jane cannot articulate her distress at Helen's words.
HELEN (CONT'D)
I could sleep now. Don’t leave me. I
like to have you near.

MARY
You’re doing something already. May I

Jane hands her the book. She has sketched Helen; her
tentative smile.
Mary turns the page; Bessie.
MARY (CONT’D)
These are wonderful...
The next page shows a sketch of St John Rivers. Mary gasps in
delight. She takes the book straight to St John, who is
diligently working at his desk.
St John -

MARY (CONT'D)

JANE
No, Mary, please MARY
See how skilled Jane is. Better than
any drawing master.
St John looks at the sketch of himself. He is quite taken
aback. He looks over at Jane, who is quite embarrassed.
ST JOHN
Is this how you perceive me, Miss
Elliott?
Jane doesn’t know how to reply. For a moment, St John seems
to be weighing up whether to be insulted.

St John and Jane are seeing Diana and Mary on to a trap. They

JANE
Mr Rivers? I wondered if you had yet
heard of any work that I could do...
ST JOHN
(still watching the coach)
I found you a situation some time ago
but I’ve delayed telling you because
the work is lowly and I fear you'll
scorn it.
JANE
I shan’t mind what I do.
St John starts walking.
ST JOHN
When I took over the parish two years
ago it had no school. I opened one for
boys; I now intend to open one for
girls. The school mistress will have a
cottage paid for by benefactors and
she’ll receive fifteen pounds a year.
You can see how humble, how ignoble it
is.
On the contrary, Jane is deeply gratified.
JANE
Mr Rivers, thank you. I accept.
ST JOHN
But you comprehend me? It’s a village
school - cottagers daughters. What
will you do with all your fine
accomplishments?
JANE
I’ll save them until they’re wanted.
They will keep.
St John watches as Jane walks on. He is impressed.

INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE.

Jane is sweeping with a broom through her tiny cottage, from
the whitewashed bedroom with its single bed, into the parlour
with its tiny fireplace. St John is laying a fire. She
considers him as he works, intent on his task. He feels her
gaze. Their eyes briefly meet.
Jane immediately opens the door and goes outside. St John
watches her exit. There is an interest in his gaze, as if she
is a mystery he must solve.

JANE (CONT’D)
This is my first home - where I am
neither dependent nor subordinate to
anyone. Thank you, Mr St John.
He notices her use of his Christian name.
ST JOHN
It is small and plain, as I told you.
JANE
Then it’ll suit me very well.
St John nods, almost - but not quite - able to return her
smile. Jane watches him walk away. With him goes all
companionship.
Jane turns around in the small space, alone.

Goodbye.

JANE

EXT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.

45

Winter trees all around. Jane is passenger on a cart, being
driven over a bridge. A great house silhouetted on the
horizon, the battlemented roof we have seen in scene one.
Jane looks at the driver, John, a black Caribbean man of
fifty five, dressed against the cold in a cap and scarf. She
peers at him, fascinated at his taciturn incongruity.
CUT TO:
The cart approaches the dark bulk of the house. A church bell
starts tolling the hour. John slows to a halt.
JOHN
Thornfield.
Only two small windows are lit. Jane looks at them, full of
misgivings. Holding the lantern, he helps her down and opens
a large wooden door, the side entrance to the house.
46

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS

We are immersed in darkness, a small point of light appears,
a candle, held by a black clad figure, Mrs Fairfax. She
smiles at Jane.

How do you do, my dear?
JANE
Are you Mrs Fairfax?
MRS FAIRFAX
Indeed I am.

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX’S PARLOUR.
Mrs Fairfax is leading Jane in.
MRS FAIRFAX
What a tedious journey you must have
had. John is quite the slowest driver
in the county. Your poor hands must be
numb; here.

46A

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 21.

Mrs Fairfax undoes the ribbon on Jane's bonnet. Jane is taken
aback, unused to motherliness of any kind.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
My goodness... How young you are.
JANE
I’m eighteen. I’ve been teaching at
Lowood for two years.
MRS FAIRFAX
Of course you have... I’m sure we’re
very lucky to have you. Leah, would
you ask Martha to make a little hot
port and cut a sandwich or two.
Leah eyes Jane with great curiosity. She hurries away.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
Draw nearer the fire. John is taking
your trunk up to your room.
She moves her abandoned knitting aside and gestures for Jane
to sit.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
I've put you at the back of the house;
I hope you don't mind. The rooms at
the front have much finer furniture
but they’re so gloomy and solitary I
think.
Jane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in
lace, embroidery, or fine crochet. The whole room is an
advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and
testament to the hours she has spent alone.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
I'm so glad you are come. To be sure
this is a grand old house but I must
confess that in winter one can feel a
little dreary and alone. Leah is a very
nice girl and John and Martha good
people too, but they are servants - and
one cannot talk to them on terms of
equality.
46B

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL.

46B

Mrs Fairfax leads Jane through the great hall, lit only by a
candle. Jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the
darkness; a richly carved Jacobean fireplace, heavy drapes,
ancient tapestries, the head of a stag. Very gloomy, eerie.
Her breath is vapourising in the cold.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 22.

JANE
Am I meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?
Who?

MRS FAIRFAX

JANE
Miss Fairfax - my pupil?
MRS FAIRFAX
You mean Miss Varens; Mr Rochester's
ward. She is to be your pupil.
JANE
Who’s Mr Rochester?
MRS FAIRFAX
Why, the owner of Thornfield. Mr
Edward Fairfax Rochester.
JANE
I thought Thornfield Hall belonged to
you.
MRS FAIRFAX
(bursting into laughter)
Oh bless you child, what an idea. To
me? I am only the housekeeper.
JANE
Forgive me MRS FAIRFAX
There is a distant connection between
Mr Rochester and I - his mother was a
Fairfax - but I’d never presume on
it. Heavens, me, owner of Thornfield?
Her laughter fills the darkness. A bashful smile is playing
on Jane's lips. Mrs Fairfax is beginning to thaw her. They
move on.
47

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - STAIRCASE / CORRIDOR / THE GALLERY.
47
Mrs Fairfax turns up a wooden staircase. Leaded windows
reflect the candlelight.
MRS FAIRFAX
We shall have a cheerful house this
winter...
Light is thrown on portraits of long dead ancestors. Mrs
Fairfax is as warm as the house is cold.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 23.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
With Miss Varens here - and with you we'll have quite a merry time of it.
Dark heavy drapes, Jane sees another striking portrait. A
dark, voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped,
one full breast exposed. Jane glances away, taken aback by
the woman’s bold expression and her nakedness.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
I'm sure that last winter - and what a
severe one - if it didn't rain it
snowed and if it didn't snow it blew last winter I declare that not a soul
came to the house from November to
February.
48

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - GALLERY / JANE’S BEDROOM.

48

Mrs Fairfax leads Jane through the wood-panelled darkness.
MRS FAIRFAX
I got quite melancholy night after
night alone. When spring finally came
I thought it a great relief that I
hadn't gone distracted.
She bursts into peals of laughter.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
Here. I’ve had Martha lay a fire.
She opens the door to a small but delightful room. Jane looks
in: a fire burning, a soft quilt, pale chintz curtains - and
a bright lamp. She is utterly speechless.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
I hope you will be comfortable.
Jane smiles her thanks. Mrs Fairfax can see how affected she
is - and how hard she is trying to button it down.
49

INT. NEXT MORNING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.

49

Jane, hair loose, opens the curtains. Her fire has been lit.
She draws her breath in at the sight of the grounds. Her rag
doll is on her bed, shabby and worn as a miniature scarecrow.
Jane pins her hair into its close, neat style. She
straightens her belongings on the dresser: a brush, a comb, a
brooch. She looks at herself in the glass, wondering what
she’ll become.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 24.

50

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL.

50

Jane enters a magnificent room; moulded ceilings, panelled
walls, crimson couches and ottomans, Turkish carpets; a
general blending of snow and fire. The room is cold, her
breath makes vapour. Mrs Fairfax is dusting ornaments of ruby
red Bohemian glass on the windowsill. Leah helps her.
JANE
I’ve never seen such an ancient old
house. How beautifully you preserve
it.
This pleases Mrs Fairfax. Jane shivers. Mrs Fairfax notices
how cold she is.
MRS FAIRFAX
Mr Rochester's visits are always
unexpected. He doesn't like to arrive
and find everything all swathed up, so
I keep it in constant readiness.
Now, come and meet Miss Varens. Did I
mention she was French?
51

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.

51

Adele Varens, an exquisitely dressed child of eight, is
chatting animatedly to Jane and Mrs Fairfax. At her side is
Sophie, her nurse - a desperately shy and lonely girl.
ADELE
Sophie a pleure car personne ne nous
comprend. Personne ne peut nous parler
a part Mr. Rochester mais il est
parti.
(Translation: Sophie has been crying
because no one understands. Nobody can
speak to us except for Mr Rochester
and he has gone away).
SOPHIE
(Shushing her)
Adele...
Jane looks more closely at Sophie; pretty, but desperately
lonely and unhappy. She cannot meet Jane’s eye.
MRS FAIRFAX
Would you ask her about her parents?
Mr Rochester's neglected to tell me
anything about her.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 25.

JANE
Ou vivais-tu Adele, avant de venir a
Thornfield.
(Translation: Where did you live
Adele, before you came to Thornfield?)
ADELE
Avec Maman, mais elle est avec la
Sainte Vierge maintenant…
(Translation: With Maman - but she is
gone to the Holy Virgin now).
JANE
Her mother has passed away.
ADELE
Maman m'apprenait a danser et a reciter
des poemes…
(Translation: Maman used to teach me to
dance and say verses). Elle me laissait
toujours m'assoir sur les genoux des
monsieurs qui venaient la visiter, et
chanter pour eux. Puis-je chanter pour
toi?
(Translation: When gentlemen came to
see her I used sit on their knees and
sing. May I sing for you now)?
JANE
Ce serait ravissant.
(Translation: Well - that would be
lovely).
(To Mrs Fairfax)
Adele is going to show us her
accomplishments.
Adele adopts a lovelorn pose. She sings an operetta song; a
forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover. Her high voice
warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather weird.
Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.
MRS FAIRFAX
How very French...
52

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.

52

Jane has laid out a large atlas, it nearly covers the table.
Adele kneeling on it, head leaning on her hands. She is
tracing round the continents with her finger. She is trying
to name countries in English, and humming a strange tune.
Mrs Fairfax is finishing a shawl, deep in a reverie.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 26.

MRS FAIRFAX
Sometimes, when I am sitting alone
it's seemed to me more than once that
my dear husband, who died years since,
has come in and sat down beside me. I
have even heard him call me by my
name, just as he used to - Alice.
A dainty clock starts to chime. Mrs Fairfax is recalled to
the present, embarrassed to have revealed herself. Jane is
looking at her with compassion.
Mrs Fairfax shakes out the finished shawl and puts it round
Jane’s shoulders, departing before Jane can protest.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
Here. For you.
Jane is delighted at the kindness of the gift.
53

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.

53

Adele is playing with a doll’s house; a model of Thornfield.
Jane has made tiny labels in English that Adele is putting on
the furniture. The dolls house is very old, as if children a
century ago once played with it. Jane is playing with one of
the little figures; a maid. In her other hand, is a girl.
JANE
‘Oh do not go,’ begged her maid, ‘For
the gytrash roams these hills...’
ADELE
Qu'est-ce?
(Translation: What’s that?)
JANE
A spirit of the North that lies in
wait for travellers. It tenants the
carcasses of beasts; possesses horses,
wolves, and great dogs. You know it
only by its eyes, which burn as red as
coals and if one should chance upon
you ADELE
Quoi? Qu'est-ce qu'il fera?
(Translation: What? What will it do)?
Jane sees that she has scared Adele.
JANE
Nothing. A mere story.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 27.

Sophie enters with drinks and biscuits for Jane and Adele.
Adele speaks confidentially to Jane.
ADELE
Sophie told me of a lady who wanders
here at night. Sometimes we hear:
Adele impersonates ghostly breathing.
ADELE (CONT’D)
We lock our door because if she gets
in she bites you with her teeth and
sucks the blood.
Jane blinks, taken aback. She looks disapprovingly at Sophie.
JANE
What nonsense.

INT. DUSK. THORNFIELD - THE LONG GALLERY.

58

Jane is watching the sun set over the snow. She looks up at
the cawing rooks - and down at the view; a darkening land of
ice. Mrs Fairfax approaches her.
MRS FAIRFAX
Whatever brings you up here? I've
been waiting to pour our tea.
JANE
I'm not in need of tea, thank you.
Mrs Fairfax approaches, concerned.
MRS FAIRFAX
It's a quiet life, isn't it? This
isolated house; a still doom for a
young woman...
Jane looks out at the view once more.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 28.

JANE
I wish a woman could have action in
her life, like a man. It agitates me
to pain that the sky-line over there
is ever our limit. I long sometimes
for a power of vision that would
overpass it. If I could behold all I
imagine... I've never seen a city,
never spoken with men. And I fear my
whole life will pass...
Jane brushes her ideas away. Mrs Fairfax puts on a practical
face, the moment of intimacy has gone.
MRS FAIRFAX
Now, exercise and fresh air; great
cures for anything, they say. I have
some letters to post. Will you take
them?
59

EXT. DUSK. A FROZEN MEADOW.

59

Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
The moon is rising, giving the frost a ghostly light.
60

EXT. DUSK. A FROZEN WOOD.

60

A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. It's slow
trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
acutely aware of everything around her.
A pheasant suddenly files up from undergrowth right by her
feet. The noise and the fluster of its wings startle her. She
laughs at herself - and enters the darkening wood.
She peers into the shadows beneath the trees.
Further on, the brook has frozen right across the path. Jane
slips on it as she passes. The noise of her feet echoes. She
steadies herself.
She hears a sound like the beating of wings. The blood is
rushing through her ears. She sees the figure of a great dog which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her
feet. The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the
rush of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her
before she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black
garments startle both horse and rider.
The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only to
have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall with
a crash.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 29.

The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo with the sound.
The horse is on one side; the man is lying, trapped beneath
it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.
ROCHESTER
Hellfire. Damnation. Up, you cursed
beast!
Jane is confounded.
Rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, the low moon
behind her.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Stand back.
With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to its
feet. Rochester tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear
no weight. He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes.
JANE
Are you injured, sir? May I be of some
help?
Rochester looks at her once more. Jane now has the moon on
her face. She begins to look less like a phantom and more
like a girl.
ROCHESTER
Where did you come from?
JANE
Just below.
Below?

ROCHESTER

JANE
At Thornfield Hall. I am the
governess.
ROCHESTER
(A slow smile)
The governess...
JANE
I’m on my way to post a letter. Can I
fetch someone to help?
ROCHESTER
You may help me yourself. Get hold of
his bridle and lead him to me.
Jane looks at the horse; huge, trampling, nervous. Rochester
is amused.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 30.

ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
If you would be so kind...
Jane tries to catch the bridle but the horse rears up. She
falls on the ice. Rochester laughs. She picks herself up.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
It would be easier to bring me to the
horse. Come here.
Jane resists the imperious tone.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I must beg of you to please come here,
Miss Governess.
Jane approaches. Rochester instantly leans all his weight on
her. She almost crumples under it; the first time she has
ever touched and been touched by a man. She holds him up. And
walks him closer to his horse.
Rochester calms it. He springs into the saddle, grimacing as
he wrenches his sprain.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Make haste with your letter.
(He bows.)
For who knows what might lurk in these
dark woods...
Rochester grins widely, then spurs his horse. Jane steps
back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in its traces.
She watches until they have gone, her face energised with the
intensity of the encounter.
61

I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT ENTRANCE/ GREAT HALL.

61

Jane runs up to the front door. She pushes it open. To her
amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace.
The whole hall is lit. Mrs Fairfax is approaching, followed
by Leah.
MRS FAIRFAX
Mr Rochester is here.
Oh?

JANE

MRS FAIRFAX
Go and change your frock; he wishes to
meet you. Leah, take her cloak.
JANE
I have to change?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 31.

MRS FAIRFAX
Oh yes - I always dress for the
evening when Mr Rochester is here.
JANE
But all my dresses are the same.
MRS FAIRFAX
(Desperately)
You must have one that is better? He’s
in a terrible humour; his horse fell
in Hay lane and his ankle is sprained.
He’s had the doctor this half hour.
Where have you been??
Mrs Fairfax and Leah anxiously hurry away. Jane finds herself
staring at the great black dog. She smooths her dress.
62

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER’S STUDY.

62

Jane enters. Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one
foot bandaged and supported on a stool. Pilot goes to his
feet - and joins Adele, who is gazing adoringly at him.
ADELE
Monsieur, voici mademoiselle.
(Translation: Here is mademoiselle,
sir).
ROCHESTER
(Without looking up)
Let her sit.
He is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches and
watercolours. She approaches feeling utterly exposed - as if
her diary is being read. She sits.
Mrs Fairfax and Leah return with tea. Mrs Fairfax quietly
fusses. Rochester continues to study Jane’s work.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I’ve examined Adele and I find you've
taken great pains with her. She's not
bright, she has no talents - yet in a
short time she's improved.
Adele is gazing at him uncomprehending.
JANE
Thank you, Mr Rochester.
ROCHESTER
You've been resident here three
months?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 32.

Yes, sir.

JANE

ROCHESTER
(finally looking up)
And from whence do you hail; what’s
your tale of woe?
Pardon?

JANE

ROCHESTER
All governesses have a tale of woe;
what's yours?
JANE
(Slightly insulted)
I was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs Reed
of Gateshead, in a house even finer
than this. I then attended Lowood
school where I received as good an
education as I could hope for. I have
no tale of woe, sir.
ROCHESTER
Where are your parents?
Dead.

JANE

ROCHESTER
Do you remember them?
No.

JANE

ROCHESTER
And why are you not with Mrs Reed of
Gateshead now?
JANE
She cast me off, sir.
Why?

ROCHESTER

JANE
Because I was burdensome and she
disliked me.
ROCHESTER
Lowood; that's a charity school, isn't
it?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 33.

Yes.

JANE

ROCHESTER
How long did you survive there?
JANE
Eight years.
ROCHESTER
No tale of woe...
MRS FAIRFAX
(placing his tea)
I daily thank providence for sending
us Miss Eyre. She's an invaluable ROCHESTER
Don't trouble yourself to give her a
character. I'll judge for myself. I
have her to thank for this sprain.
Sir?

MRS FAIRFAX

ROCHESTER
You bewitched my horse.
For a second Mrs Fairfax thinks Rochester might be addressing
her. But he is giving Jane a piercing stare. Mrs Fairfax
looks at Jane, bewildered.
I did not.

JANE

ROCHESTER
Were you waiting for your people on
that lane?
JANE
I have no people, sir.
ROCHESTER
I mean for the imps and elves and the
little green men.
JANE
The sad truth is they are all gone.
Your land is neither wild nor savage
enough for them.
You lie.

ROCHESTER

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 34.

Mrs Fairfax puts her tea down, supremely perplexed by this
line of conversation. Rochester lifts one of Jane’s
watercolours.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Adele brought me these; are they
yours?
Yes sir.

JANE

A swollen sea. A cormorant, a golden bracelet held in its
beak. A girl's arm coming out of the water, white and
deathly, her drowned figure underneath.
ROCHESTER
Where did you get your copies?
JANE
Out of my head.
ROCHESTER
That head I now see on your shoulders?
Yes sir.

JANE

He turns to the next. The top of a hill. An expanse of
twilight sky. Rising up, a girl's shape, her forehead crowned
with a star, red hair flowing; Helen Burns.
ROCHESTER
Who's this?
JANE
The evening star.
Rochester gives her a direct gaze. He looks at the next. A
dark turbanned figure with a wreath of white flame above its
head. Mrs Fairfax is cutting a dark cake.
ROCHESTER
Where you happy when you painted
these?
Mrs Fairfax sets the cake out, glancing at Jane’s gloomy
water colours. She doesn’t like them.
JANE
Yes. To paint is one of the keenest
pleasures I have ever known.
ROCHESTER
Then your pleasures have been few...
Are you satisfied with them?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 35.

JANE
Far from it. I imagine things I’m
powerless to execute.
ROCHESTER
Not quite. You’ve secured the shadow
of your thoughts. Yet the drawings
are, for a schoolgirl... peculiar.
Jane has no reply. Rochester looks at her for longer than is
comfortable. Then he abruptly dismisses her.
Goodnight.
63

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY

63

Mrs Fairfax is saying grace over lunch with Jane and Adele.
MRS FAIRFAX
Most merciful Father, we give thee
humble thanks for this, thy special
bounty. Amen.
Amen.

JANE & ADELE

They are about to tuck in when suddenly piano music strikes
up, furiously played. It is the fiery kind of music one would
normally hear in a shebeen, not in a quiet country manor.
Adele swings round in her chair, grinning..
MRS FAIRFAX
Sit nicely please, Adele.
Neither Mrs Fairfax nor Jane knows what to make of the music.
Rochester fills the house with it - as if he wants to impress
his life and presence upon it. Mrs Fairfax is beginning to
find it oppressive. Then it abruptly stops.
ADELE
Tonight I will have my cadeaux. He
always bring me a cadeaux. Perhaps he
bring you one too.
JANE
A present Adele and no, he will not.
Mrs Fairfax breathes a sigh of relief, her peace restored.
She lifts her fork to her mouth when the music starts up
again. Jane finds it infectious. Despite herself, a smile
begins to break through. The piece climbs to a frenzied,
overdone ending, then suddenly stops mid-note.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 36.

JANE (CONT'D)
He is very abrupt and changeful...
Footsteps pass, a door swings open and Rochester passes the
window, stepping out into the cold grounds. Adele flies to
the window to watch him.
JANE (CONT'D)
What manner of man is he?
Outside, Rochester is throwing a stick for Pilot.
MRS FAIRFAX
He’s a very good master. And fine
company too - when he’s in a good
humour.

64

DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.

64

Jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele. Her
playing is full of energy, very free. Her cheeks look almost
rosy. It is spring. The gardener and his boy are hard at
work. Rochester is with them. Together they are lifting a
huge root out of the ground.
Jane stares at Rochester, losing her concentration.
65

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER’S STUDY.

65

Rochester sits at the piano, brooding. He keeps playing the
same augmented fourth over and over. A dismal sound. He sighs
deeply; anything but a good humour. Jane finds herself
staring at him. Mrs Fairfax hands him tea, with some
trepidation.
Keep it.

ROCHESTER

He goes to pour himself a drink. He stands at the
mantelpiece, staring into the fire. Jane looks questioningly
at Mrs Fairfax. Mrs Fairfax looks back, warning her to remain
silent.
Rochester knocks the drink back. At that moment Adele enters
with Sophie. A ribboned box sits on the table.
ADELE
Ma boite, ma boite!
(Translation: My box! My box!)
Her excitement grates on Rochester’s nerves.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 37.

ROCHESTER
Take it away and disembowel it.
ADELE
Oh Ciel! Que c'est beau! (Translation:
Oh Heavens! It is so beautiful!)
Adele is already pulling a pink satin dress out of the box.
Miss Eyre.

ROCHESTER

He gestures to a chair by the fire, no warmth in his
expression. Jane sits.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I'm not fond of children.
(BEAT).
Nor do I particularly enjoy simpleminded old ladies.
This is loud enough for Mrs Fairfax to hear.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
But you might suit me - if you would.
How, sir?

JANE

ROCHESTER
By distracting me from the mire of my
thoughts.
Adele, irrepressible, runs across the room embracing the
dress. She drops on one knee at Rochester's feet.
ADELE
Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois
de votre bonte...
(Translation: Sir, I thank you ever
so much for your generosity…)
She looks up, seeking his approval.
ADELE (CONT'D)
That is how Maman used to say...
ROCHESTER
Precisely. And that’s how she charmed
my English gold out of my English
pocket.
MRS FAIRFAX
Let's try it on, shall we?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 38.

Adele skips off with a mortified Mrs Fairfax and Sophie.
Rochester notices how keenly Jane is observing him. He waits
a beat before asking...
ROCHESTER
Your gaze is very direct, Miss Eyre?
D'you think me handsome?
No sir.

JANE

Rochester laughs.
ROCHESTER
What fault do you find with me? I have
all my limbs and features JANE
I beg your pardon. I ought to have
replied that beauty is of little
consequence ROCHESTER
You’re blushing Miss Eyre. And though
you’re not pretty any more than I am
handsome, I must say it becomes you...
And now I see you're fascinated by the
flowers on the rug.
Jane senses his mockery.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Come, speak to me.
The fact is, Miss Eyre, I’d like to
draw you out. You have rather the look
of another world and I don't wish to
treat you as inferior.
JANE
Yet you'd command me to speak?
ROCHESTER
Are you very hurt by my tone of
command?
Jane smiles.
JANE
There are few masters who'd trouble to
enquire whether their paid
subordinates were hurt by their
commands.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 39.

ROCHESTER
Paid subordinate... I'd forgotten the
salary. Well on that mercenary ground,
will you consent to speak as my equal without thinking that the request
arises from insolence?
JANE
I'd never mistake informality for
insolence, sir. One, I rather like.
The other, nothing free born should
ever submit to Humbug -

ROCHESTER

JANE
Even for a salary.
ROCHESTER
Most free-born things would submit to
anything for a salary. But I mentally
shake hands with you for your answer.
Not three in three thousand schoolgirl
governesses would have answered me as
you've just done.
JANE
Then you've not spent much time in our
company, sir. I'm the same plain kind
of bird as all the rest, with my
common tale of woe.
ROCHESTER
I envy you.
How?

JANE

ROCHESTER
Your openness, your unpolluted mind.
If I were eighteen I think we truly
would be equals. Nature meant me to be
a good man but as you see, I am not
so.
JANE
Are you a villain then, sir?
ROCHESTER
I'm a trite commonplace sinner.
When I was your age, fate dealt me a
blow. Dread remorse, Miss Eyre. It is
the poison of life.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 40.

Rochester takes in her open, puzzled face.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
And since happiness is denied me, I've
a right to get pleasure in its stead.
And I will get it, cost what it may.
JANE
Then you'll degenerate still more.
ROCHESTER
But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I was
seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was
an inspiration; if it wore the robes
of an angel of light... what then?
JANE
To speak truth, I don't understand you
at all. I fear the conversation has
got out of my depth.
Rochester laughs.
ROCHESTER
You're afraid of me.
JANE
I'm not afraid. I've simply no wish to
talk nonsense.
ROCHESTER
Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?
This question cuts Jane to the quick.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Only rarely, perhaps. But you're not
naturally austere, any more than I'm
naturally vicious. I can see in you the
glance of a curious sort of bird
through the close set bars of a cage: a
vivid, restless captive. Were it but
free, it would soar. Cloud high.
Jane opens her mouth to speak - but she cannot.

INT. DUSK. THORNFIELD - GALLERY.

Jane is in the gallery looking intently at a picture of a
voluptuous, naked woman reclining on a bed. She studies it
with an artist’s curiosity - and a girl’s.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 41.

68

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE’S BEDROOM / CORRIDOR.

68

Jane wakes. Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in. She
hears it again; the thud from her dream. It’s a knock against
her door.
JANE
Who's there?
Jane gets out of bed and gingerly pulls the door open.
There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush
matting, flickering in the draft.
JANE (CONT'D)
Who’s there?
Jane picks up the candle. She walks up the corridor.
Jane senses something on the air. A smell. She sees a curling
wreath of grey smoke. She follows its trail through the pitch
darkness. It is coming thickly from a half-open door Rochester's chamber.
68AA

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER’S BEDROOM.

68AA

Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings, the
curtains, are alight. The room is full of smoke. She pulls
the huge window open.
JANE
Wake up! Wake up! Sir!
Rochester is asleep. She shakes him. He stirs, stupefied by
the acrid smoke. Jane takes his basin and douses him.
Wake up!!

JANE (CONT'D)

Rochester wakes.
JANE (CONT'D)
It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.
ROCHESTER
What in damnation - ?
Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains.
Rochester leaps out of bed, pulls the fabric from its rail
and smothers the remaining flames.
They don’t stop until all the flames are quenched. Smoke
billows out through the window into the cold gale.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 42.

Jane becomes aware that Rochester is only half dressed. She
turns away, mortified. He is pulling on a shirt.
JANE
A noise aroused me from my sleep.
ROCHESTER
What noise?
JANE
There was someone at my door. I opened
it. A candle was burning there, placed
on the matting.
ROCHESTER
Stay here. Don't make a sound.
Rochester gets his coat and puts it round her. He goes,
taking the light. Jane looks at his ruined chamber; the
blackened drapes on the four poster bed, the fireplace, the
huge wardrobe. It is not unlike the red room.
Jane wraps the coat around her. Overhead, she hears a door
thud to. She waits. Nothing, not a sound. She backs into an
armchair. She curls up inside the coat.
CUT TO:
A gust of wind blows in through the window bringing the first
light of day. Jane wraps the coat tighter. She closes her
eyes, running her fingers down the lining, smelling its
owner.
She looks up. Rochester is watching her.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Say nothing about this. You’re no
talking fool.
But -

JANE

ROCHESTER
I’ll account for this state of affairs.
Say nothing.
JANE
Yes, sir.
(She takes off his coat.)
ROCHESTER
Is that how you would leave me?
Rochester is between Jane and the door. He uses her name.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 43.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Jane... fire is a horrible death. You
have saved my life. Don't walk past
me as if we were strangers.
JANE
What am I to do then?
ROCHESTER
At least... take my hand.
Rochester holds out his hand. Jane takes it. Rochester wraps
her hand in both of his.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I have a pleasure in owing you my
life.
JANE
There is no debt.
Rochester is looking at her small hand. She tries to inch it
back. He doesn’t let her. She looks up at him.
ROCHESTER
I knew you would do me good in some
way. I saw it in your eyes when I first
beheld you. Their expression did not
strike my very inmost being so, for
nothing. People talk of natural
sympathies... You.
Rochester is drawing her slowly closer. Jane, disconcerted,
is trying to resist.
JANE
Good night then, sir.
ROCHESTER
So you will leave me?
Jane doesn’t move. Her breath is heightened. It vapourises.
I am cold.
Go.

JANE
ROCHESTER

At last, he relaxes his grip. She passes him. She goes.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL.

Jane peers in. The room is cold. Jane crosses it. There is no
sign of Rochester. The house is once more quiet as a church.
Mrs Fairfax crosses the gallery.
JANE
Has Mr Rochester not sent for us
today?
MRS FAIRFAX
Why, he's gone away. Were you not
aware? He left after breakfast.
Jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
He's gone to The Leas, Mr Eshton's
place. I believe Blanche Ingram is
there. She's a great favourite of his.
Oh?

JANE

MRS FAIRFAX
I saw her two years ago when Mr
Rochester had a party here. The most
elegant girl. They sang a duet
together; made a lovely harmony. I was
quite surprised he didn't make a
proposal - but she has no fortune... In
every other way they’d make a splendid
match. Perhaps it’s his intention now.
Mrs Fairfax has given Jane a veiled warning.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
Of course it’s far more likely he’ll go
off to Europe. He often leaves without
so much as a fare-you-well and I don’t
see him for a year.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER’S ROOM.

72

Jane is at the window watching the rain hammer against it.
The room has been stripped bare and scrubbed clean. All trace
of its owner have gone. Desolate. Jane is having an intense
emotional reaction to the loss of Rochester. As she brings a
hand up to her face, we see that it is shaking.
Adele is watching her from the doorway, puzzled.
ADELE (O.S.)
Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?
(Translation: What's wrong, miss?)
Jane turns.

Jane unlocks her door. Mrs Fairfax is on the threshold of her
room, a letter in her hand.
MRS FAIRFAX
He's back tomorrow.
Jane is flushed with anticipation.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
He gives directions to prepare all the
rooms but he cannot give numbers. I'm
to get more staff from the George Inn.
Miss Ingram is coming!
Jane does her best to hide her disappointment. Mrs Fairfax is
flustered.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
Supplies to be got; linen, the
mattresses... I'll go to the George.
No, I'll tell Martha...
Jane can sense that the old lady is overwhelmed.

JANE
May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax?
Mrs Fairfax approaches Jane in a rush of gratitude.
76

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.

76

Adele comes skidding down the newly polished gallery in her
tights. Jane passes, wearing a housekeeper’s apron over her
dress. She throws herself into preparing the house.
77

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS.

77

Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table
in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity except for one lone figure sitting in a chair by the fire,
smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Martha and one of the hired
under cooks are talking about her.
Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested. She
moves a bit nearer with her work, trying to overhear.
UNDER COOK
No wonder the master relies on her Martha notices Jane's curious glance. She shushes the under
cook. At that moment, Sophie rushes in with Adele.
SOPHIE
Ils sont la!
(Translation: They are here!)
Adele makes a bee-line for the kitchen window.
ADELE
Regardez! Regardez!
(Translation: Look! Look!)
Jane curiously looks over Adele’s shoulder. From her P.O.V we
can see the guests arriving, THREE carriages and a pair of
horses at the head, BLANCHE and Rochester. The servants are
filing out of the kitchen to greet the party. Adele follows,
pushing her way through the bottleneck down the corridor.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHEN CORRIDOR/ENTRANCE HALL.77A
Adele flies out of the corridor into the great hall. Jane
follows Mrs Fairfax, helping her to untie her apron.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 47.

Mrs Fairfax, slightly flustered, goes into the lower
courtyard and organises the staff into a line to greet the
guests. She stands at the head, forming herself into a
picture of helpful dignity.
Jane, who has no place in the line, is unsure where to go.
77B

INT/EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL/OUTSIDE WINDOW. 77B
Adele is at the window. Jane gravitates towards her, unable
to stop herself from watching Rochester gallantly helping
Blanche off her horse. They then lead the party towards the
house as servants unload the carriage’s luggage and supplies.
Blanche is leaning on Rochester’s arm, already established as
first lady of the party. She is an elegant young woman,
beautifully attired.
ADELE
Qu’elle est belle...
(Transaltion: She's so beautiful...)
Blanche laughs at something Rochester has said. She half
smiles at Mrs Fairfax and the staff but has eyes only for
him. Jane turns away trying to quell her emotions.
Rochester enters the house. Adele, hearing his voice, runs to
the door.
JANE
Adele, come away.
Adele’s face falls.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY. AN HOUR LATER

Jane and Adele are working but neither concentrates. They are

Adele leaps up, delighted. Jane is blanched.

Jane is delivering Adele into the centre of the company. She
has on her best dress - still very plain - and has tried
something different with her hair.
ADELE
Bonjour, mesdames, monsieurs.
(Translation: Good day.)
Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, ringlets, lace
gloves. In the midst of the crowd is Blanche.
BLANCHE
Why, what a little puppet.
Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses.
Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of
refuge. Jane pulls her work on to her lap; a beaded purse.
She doesn’t lift her eyes from it - but she listens. Blanche
arrives at Rochester’s side.
BLANCHE (CONT'D)
Why don't you send her to school?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 49.

ROCHESTER
She has a governess.
Jane glances up. Rochester is turning his back to her.
BLANCHE
Poor child. I had half a dozen in my
day, all detestable incubi.
LADY INGRAM
Mr Rochester, beware the governess.
BLANCHE
Mamma thinks they are generally
hysterics.
LADY INGRAM
Or degenerates.
BLANCHE
It’s a miracle that I survived my
education.
Jane's fingers sew. Only the briefest flash of her eyes shows
her mortification.
BLANCHE (CONT'D)
I remember the way Miss Wilson would
scream ‘You villainous girl!’ And Rochester is moving away. Blanche sees that the subject is
failing to amuse him; a momentary flash of panic.
BLANCHE (CONT’D)
Enough of the whole dreary race. We
shall have music - and a new subject.
Signor Eduardo, what shall it be?
She sits and starts playing a brilliant prelude on the piano.
Rochester considers her.
ROCHESTER
I give you beauty...
BLANCHE
Why there's nothing new to be said. I
give you back male beauty.
LADY INGRAM
Well that’s my son, of course.
Hear hear.

LORD INGRAM

Blanche’s effete brother is sprawled on a chaise nearby.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 50.

BLANCHE
A man should pay no heed to his looks.
(Glancing at Rochester)
He should possess only strength and
valour. Gentleman or a highwayman; his
beauty lies in his power.
ROCHESTER
So a pirate would do for you?
Blanche coyly demurs. Rochester laughs quietly. Jane is
heading for the door.
83

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL/STAIRWELL

83

Jane closes the door on Blanche. She breathes in fresh air,
almost nauseous. Blanche’s splendid prelude drifts out.
Rochester comes into the hall from the other door. Jane
instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe.
ROCHESTER
Why did you leave the room?
JANE
I am tired, sir.
ROCHESTER
Why didn't you come and speak to me? I
haven't seen you for weeks. It would
have been normal and polite to wish me
good evening.
JANE
You seemed engaged.
ROCHESTER
You look pale.
I am well.

What have you been doing while I’ve
been away?
JANE

Rochester catches sight of Mrs Fairfax, who is watching them
with an expression of unease. Rochester barks at her.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
What is it?
MRS FAIRFAX
A gentleman is here to see you, sir...
From Spanish Town, Jamaica. And indeed
I think he must have come from some
hot place because he won't take off
his coat. Mr Richard Mason. I’ve put
him in the morning room.
Rochester cannot speak.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
Have I done wrong?
ROCHESTER
Bring him to my study.
Mrs Fairfax goes. Rochester sinks on to the stairs.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Jane - Jane. This is a blow.
Blanche's prelude trills on in the great hall. Over it, the
guests’ laughter. Rochester takes Jane’s hand.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
If I were to go to those people and
they looked at me coldly and sneered,
then left me one by one, what would you
do? Would you go with them?
JANE
No sir. I’d stay with you.
ROCHESTER
And if they came and spat at me, what
then?
JANE
I’d turn them out of the room sir, if
I could.
ROCHESTER
And if they cast you out for it?
JANE
I’d care nothing about it.
ROCHESTER
You'd dare condemnation for my sake?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 52.

His look is intense. Jane feels out of her depth.
JANE
For the sake of any friend who deserved
it.
Rochester rapidly lets go Jane’s hand as if her reserved
reply has somehow betrayed him. She follows his gaze. A gaunt
man is approaching them.
Richard.

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE’S BEDROOM

Jane wakes to the sound of a savage, sharp shriek that seems
to split the night in two. Overhead, the sounds of a
struggle. A man cries out. Cries out again in pain and
horror. Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She pulls on
her shawl.
Directly over head she hears a muffled voice scream for help.
A great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a
thud; the man whimpering now. Jane grabs her candle and
leaves her room.
86

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - SECOND FLOOR LANDING.
The guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some
with candles, some stumbling into the dark. The gallery is
filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen. Their
shadows dance grotesquely on the walls.
LADY INGRAM
Oh what is it?
BLANCHE
Who is hurt? Who screamed like that?

86

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 53.

Rochester comes forth from the latched door at the end of the
gallery, holding a candelabra. He passes Jane and orders her:
Wait.

ROCHESTER

LADY INGRAM
Where’s Rochester?
ROCHESTER
I'm here, be composed.
Blanche flies towards him like a banshee. She embraces him in
an affectation of fear. Rochester patiently removes her.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
A servant has had a nightmare, that's
all. She's an excitable person and has
taken a fit with fright.
He speaks to Blanche gently, as if she’s a child. He pushes
her hair aside; an intimacy that causes a pang to Jane.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I must see you back into your rooms
because until the house is settled,
she can't be properly looked after.
BLANCHE
Is there anything I might do?
ROCHESTER
Miss Ingram, ladies, please return to
your nests like the doves that you
are. I assure you, all is well.
Blanche coyly acquiesces, using every opportunity to show off
her semi-opaque nightgown. The candles flicker as the guests
make their way back to their rooms. Jane too is about to go.
Rochester silently gestures her to stay.
Blanche is at her door, eyes lingering on Rochester. Lady
Ingram closes Blanche into her room with a loaded glance at
Jane: What are her intentions?
As soon as she’s gone, Rochester turns to Jane.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Come with me.
Holding the light aloft, he heads for the third floor.

87

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - A THIRD FLOOR CHAMBER.

87

Rochester stops by a low door. He puts a key in the lock.
ROCHESTER
Be steady. I need you.
He unlocks it. A room hung with tapestries; a dark oak
cabinet along one wall with portraits of the apostles on its
panels. One part of the tapestry is hooked up over a hidden
door - which lies open to an inner chamber. A dull, sickly
light shines out.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Get some water.
He goes to the inner chamber. A moan of anguish, of remorse
greets him. Jane shudders. She fetches the ewer and bowl as
Rochester locks the door.
Here.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Rochester goes to a low day bed. Richard Mason is lying on
his side, his back and all the linen soaked in blood. There
is a wound to his neck, jagged, bruised and ugly; a bite.
Jane controls her reaction. Rochester cuts the bloody shirt
away revealing a stab wound to the back of his shoulder.
Rochester turns to Jane.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Can you clean this?
Jane looks at the daunting mess. She begins to clean it.
Rochester is taking a phial from a wooden box. He puts ten
drops of crimson liquid into a tiny glass.
Mason is calming; staring at Jane with puzzlement.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Drink Richard, it will give you the
strength you lack.
MASON
Will it hurt me?
Drink!

ROCHESTER

Mason drinks. Rochester turns to Jane.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I must go for the doctor. Sponge the
blood away when it returns.
(MORE)

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 55.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Give him water if he wants it. Do not
speak to him for any reason. And
Richard - on pain of death - do not
speak to her.

Rochester takes the candelabra leaving only one light. He is
gone. Mason is staring at Jane, receding into a trance. There
is something about the pupils in his eyes that she finds
chilling. She dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes
away the trickling gore.
CUT TO:
The water in the bowl is dark red, the wounds covered in
strips of cloth. Low buzzing of a bluebottle. It lands on one
of the dressings. Jane brushes it away, disgusted.
Mason is insensible, his eyes still open. Jane hears a deep
human moan from the inner chamber.
CUT TO:
Jane hears a distant whisper. She glances at her patient; he
is sleeping. She approaches the inner door and puts her ear
to it.
A woman’s whisper. A language unrecognisable to Jane. Some
kind of incantation, maybe a prayer. It is urgent, like a
warning. She listens, fearful, fascinated. She hears
footsteps approach. She dashes back to the bed just as
Rochester opens the door. With him is Carter, the doctor.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
How does he?
Jane has not composed herself enough to speak.
DR CARTER
He's bled a great deal.

Hurry Carter, be on alert, the sun
will soon rise and he must be gone.

John drives the carriage away. For a moment Rochester doesn’t
move. Then he takes Jane’s arm and pulls her away from the
house.
ROCHESTER
That house is a dungeon.
JANE
It is a splendid mansion, sir.
Dawn light illuminates the trees. Rochester keeps walking.
ROCHESTER
It’s a strange night you’ve passed.
Yes sir.

ROCHESTER
You showed no fear.
JANE
I was afraid. Of the inner room.
ROCHESTER
You were in no danger.
JANE
Mr Rochester, who did that violence?
ROCHESTER
I cannot tell you.
JANE
Why do you protect them?
Rochester is trying to find words. He sits, pulling Jane down
next to him.
ROCHESTER
I drag through life a capital error.
Its consequence blights my existence.
For years I have sought to escape it
in bitter exile, seeking respite in
heartless, sensual pleasure.
He looks at her open, anxious face. He seems to change his
mind about what to say.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
This spring, I came home heartsore and
soul-withered. And I met a gentle
stranger whose society revives me.
With her I feel I could live again in
a higher, purer way.

Jane’s face falls.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Tell me, am I justified in overleaping
an obstacle of custom to attain her?
JANE
There is an obstacle?

A mere conventional impediment.
JANE
But what can it be? If you cherish an
affection, Sir then fortune alone
should not impede you...
Yes.

she’s indicated that she may
reciprocate ROCHESTER
Jane... of whom do you think I speak?
JANE
Of Miss Ingram.
Rochester is stunned at her miscomprehension.
ROCHESTER
But I am asking what Jane Eyre would
do to secure my happiness?
JANE
I would do anything for you, sir.
Anything that was right.
ROCHESTER
(Gently)
Yes. And if I ever bid you do what was
not right, you'd turn to me and say
‘No sir, that’s impossible. I cannot
do it, because it is wrong.' And you'd
gaze at me with that face, there;
immutable as a fixed star. Perhaps the
greatest danger to me, is you...
JANE
I could never harm you.

You transfix me quite.
He roughly pulls the head of a flower as if the sight of it
pains him. He puts it in Jane’s hair.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I feel I can speak to you now of my
lovely one, for you have met her and
you know her. She's a rare one, isn't
she? Fresh and healthy, without soil
or taint. I’m sure she’ll regenerate
me with a vengeance.
The gardener appears. Jane and Rochester look at the clock.
Jane suddenly feels vulnerable in her night attire. She goes.

it. Blanche’s maid is in attendance some distance away.
The feather falls. Rochester picks it up. Gallantly, on one
knee, he holds it out to Blanche. She reaches out her hand
for it, full of expectation. Jane cannot bear to witness his
proposal.

Blanche looks at Jane with a flash of rage.

squandered his fortune and he has
committed suicide. The news has so
shocked my aunt, that it's brought on a
stroke.

her badly and I can't neglect her
wishes now.

A nurse is opening the curtains. Mrs Reed blinks in the

Mrs Reed, with an effort, pulls her hand away from Jane's.
MRS REED
No one knows the trouble I have with

Please, don't think of it MRS REED

Mrs Reed indicates a box on her bedside table.
MRS REED (CONT'D)
Open that box. Take out the letter.
Read it.
Jane obeys. She reads the letter aloud.
JANE
'Madam, will you have the goodness to
send me the address of my niece, Jane
Eyre. I desire her to come to me at
Madeira. Fortune has blessed my
endeavours and as I am childless I wish
to adopt her and bequeath her at my
death whatever I may have to leave.
Yours, John Eyre, Madeira.'
Jane is stunned.
JANE (CONT'D)
This is dated three years ago. Why did
I never hear of it?
MRS REED
Because I wrote and told him you had
died of typhus at Lowood school.
This dreadful revelation confounds Jane.

You fury. You were born to be my
torment. You called the names of the
dead down upon me. You cursed me.

I’m currently living at Thornfield
Hall, where I am governess to the ward
of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester ROCHESTER (O.S.)
There you are.
Jane turns. Rochester is sitting on a footbridge. For a
moment her every nerve is unstrung.

Just like one of your tricks, to steal
in along with the twilight. Where have
you been this last month?
JANE
I have been with my aunt sir, who is
dead.

Rochester laughs. Jane is still trying to compose herself.
ROCHESTER
A true Janian reply. She comes from
another world... If I dared I'd touch
you, to see if you were real.
He puts out his hand. Jane steps back. He is disappointed.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Come Jane - stay your wandering feet
at a friend's threshold.
His hand is still held out. Jane takes it. This intimacy
forces her feelings from her.
JANE
I'm strangely glad to get back again.
She has said too much. She sees the effect on Rochester, a
smile, painful, almost sardonic. She fears he is laughing at
her. She hurries up towards Thornfield.

he’s making preparations to travel to
Europe. He’s taken to singing at all
times of day... the operas Miss Ingram
favours so well. We’ll hear their
announcement soon, I’m sure.
Jane cannot endure it. She leaves.
99

EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE GARDENS

99

Jane is walking away from the house. She sees Rochester and
approaches him.
JANE
You are to be married.
ROCHESTER
Indeed. I see Mrs Fairfax has
intimated my intention to put my neck
into the sacred noose.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 64.

JANE
Adele should go to school. And I must
seek another situation.
She walks on. Then turns.
JANE (CONT’D)
Congratulations, sir.
Rochester catches her up. He walks with her out of the garden
and into the grounds beyond.
ROCHESTER
Thornfield is a pleasant place in
summer, isn't it?
Yes sir.

JANE

ROCHESTER
You’ll be sorry to part with it.
It’s always the way with events in
life. No sooner have you got settled
than a voice cries ‘rise and move on!’
I’ll find you a new situation Jane, one
I hope that you’ll accept.
JANE
I shall be ready when your order to
march comes.
Rochester blocks her path.
ROCHESTER
Must I really lose a faithful paid
subordinate such as yourself?
You must.

JANE

Jane keeps on walking - into a wilder part of the estate.
ROCHESTER
We've been good friends, haven't we?
Yes, sir.

JANE

ROCHESTER
I have a strange feeling with regard to
you: as if I had a string somewhere
under my left ribs, tightly knotted to
a similar string in you. And if you
were to leave I’m afraid that cord of
communion would snap.
(MORE)

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 65.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
And then I’ve a notion that I’d take to
bleeding inwardly. As for you - You’d
forget me.

Jane finally stops, her great distress escaping her.
JANE
How? I have lived a full life here. I
have not been trampled on. I have not
been petrified. I have not been
excluded from every glimpse of what is
bright. I have talked, face to face,
with an original, expanded mind. I
have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
strikes me with anguish to be torn
from you.
ROCHESTER
Then why must you leave?
JANE
Because of your wife!
ROCHESTER
I have no wife.
JANE
But you are to be married.
ROCHESTER
Yes - Jane, you must stay.
JANE
And become nothing to you? Am I a
machine without feelings? Do you think
that because I am poor, obscure, plain
and little that I am soulless and
heartless? I have as much soul as you
and full as much heart. And if God had
blessed me with beauty and wealth I
could make it as hard for you to leave
me as it is for I to leave you.
This comes as a revelation to Rochester.
JANE (CONT'D)
I’m not speaking to you through mortal
flesh. It's my spirit that addresses
your spirit as if we'd passed through
the grave and stood at God's feet,
equal - as we are.
Rochester takes Jane in his arms.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 66.

As we are.

ROCHESTER

She struggles.
JANE
(Freeing herself)
I am a free human being with an
independent will, which I now exert to
leave you.
Rochester releases her.
ROCHESTER
Then let your will decide your
destiny. I offer you my hand, my heart
and a share of all this.
He gestures towards the house, the land. Jane is stunned.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
I ask you to pass through life at my
side. Jane, you are my equal and my
likeness. Will you marry me?
JANE
Are you mocking me?
ROCHESTER
Do you doubt me?
JANE
Entirely.
(BEAT)
Your bride is Miss Ingram ROCHESTER
Miss Ingram? She is the machine
without feelings. It's you - you rare,
unearthly thing. Poor and obscure as
you are - please accept me as your
husband.
Jane begins to believe him, she studies his face.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
I must have you for my own.
JANE
You wish me to be your wife?
ROCHESTER
I swear it.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 67.

JANE
You love me?
I do.

ROCHESTER

JANE
Then sir, I will marry you.
They embrace.
Neither Jane nor Rochester moves. Darkness is almost
complete. Still the intensity of the embrace is held.
A sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky. Some
moments later a distant rumble of thunder.
100

I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GARDEN.

100

It is teeming with rain. Rochester and Jane run to the front
entrance. He holds his jacket around her. Lightning.
100A

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL

100A

They reach the dry hearth inside. Thunder. They are both
euphoric, breathless, laughing.
ROCHESTER
Good night. Good night. My love.
He kisses her. They kiss again. Jane will not let him go.
JANE
Good night.
As Jane parts from him, she sees Mrs Fairfax above on the
gallery. She is looking down, deeply shocked.
101

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.

101

Adele is climbing over a fallen tree, Sophie with her. It has
been split open by a lightning bolt. Mrs Fairfax is very
concerned.
JANE
Am I a monster? Is it so impossible
that Mr Rochester should love me?
MRS FAIRFAX
No, I've long noticed that you were a
sort of pet of his. But you're so young
and so little acquainted with men.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 68.

Adele is whispering the news in Sophie’s ear. Sophie cannot
hide her shock. She finds it incomprehensible.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
I don't want to grieve you child, but
let me put you on your guard.
Gentlemen in his position... Let's
just say they’re not accustomed to
marry their governesses. Until you are
wed, distrust yourself as well as him.
Please, keep him at a distance Jane has heard enough. She turns away. Adele follows her. And
clings to her.
102

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - BY THE GATE.

102

Jane is waiting. Rochester approaches on horseback, Pilot at
his side. He sees Jane’s agitation and slows the horse.
ROCHESTER
What is it?
Jane cannot articulate.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Jane Eyre with nothing to say?
JANE
Everything seems unreal.
ROCHESTER
I am real enough.
He draws her close. She clings to him.
JANE
You sir are most phantom-like of all.
103

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GARDEN.

103

Rochester is walking with Jane. He wants a kiss. She resists.
He draws her close. Her resistance is crumbling. At last she
kisses him - as briefly as she can. She pulls away.
104

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX’S PARLOUR.

104

A box sits on the table. Jane pulls out a wedding gown.
Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane holds
it up, dismayed at its opulence.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 69.

Adele pulls out a vapoury veil. It goes on and on, with a
wraith-like, ghostly shimmer. Adele wraps the veil around
herself.
JANE
(whispers)
I will be Jane Eyre no longer...

Jane is in her wedding gown. Sophie is pinning on a square of

ADELE

Adele gives her a small bouquet. Jane hugs her, very moved as if she is leaving her childhood behind.
109

INT/EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GREAT HALL/GROUNDS.

109

Rochester is waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Jane walks
down to him. Rochester, moved by her beauty, grips her hand.
They pass Mrs Fairfax. She’s full of concern.
They quit the house. Outside, a new coach is waiting. John
watches as they pass. His expression is deeply uneasy.

111

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE CHURCH.

111

Rochester is striding towards a small church. As they
approach the graveyard, Jane stumbles. She cannot go on. At
last, Rochester perceives her. He lets her rest, suddenly
full of solicitude.
When Jane is ready, Rochester forces himself to calmness and
leads her into the church.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 70.

112

INT. DAY. THE CHURCH.

112

At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester. He is looking
straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood.
WOOD
I require and charge you both, as ye
will answer at the dreadful day of
judgement when the secrets of all
hearts shall be revealed, that if
either of you know any impediment why
ye may not be lawfully joined together
in matrimony, ye do now confess it.
There is not a sound. The clergyman prepares the rings.
WOOD (CONT'D)
Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you take A commotion at the back of the church. Two men rapidly enter.
One of them Briggs, hurries up the aisle.
BRIGGS
The marriage cannot go on. I declare
the existence of an impediment.
Proceed.

ROCHESTER

Wood is utterly dismayed.
BRIGGS
An insurmountable impediment exists.
Proceed!

ROCHESTER

BRIGGS
Mr Rochester has a wife now living.
Jane looks at Rochester. He denies nothing; defies
everything. Briggs starts to read out a document.
BRIGGS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I affirm and can prove that Edward
Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years ago
married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta
Mason at St James church, Spanish Town,
Jamaica. A copy of the register is now
in my possession. Signed, Richard
Mason.
The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is
Richard Mason. Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of
rage escapes him. He lifts his arm.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 71.

Good God -

MASON

WOOD
Sir, you are in a sacred place Mason flinches away. Rochester swallows his rage.
MASON
She is at Thornfield Hall. I saw there
in April. I’m her brother.
Rochester turns towards Jane. She remains where she was
abandoned - at the altar - tiny under the vaulted arch. The
bouquet falls from her hand. Rochester walks to her.
ROCHESTER
This girl knew nothing. She thought all
was fair and legal. She never dreamt
she was being entrapped into a feigned
union with a defrauded wretch.
A tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester pulls
her from the altar to his side.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Come Jane. Come all of you and meet my
wife.
The sun outside is blinding. Jane closes her eyes.
113

I/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE ENTRANCE / GREAT HALL

113

Rochester enters pulling Jane after him, her hand still in
his iron grip. Wood, Mason and Briggs follow.
Mrs Fairfax, Adele and the servants are waiting. Adele runs
forward with confetti. Rochester stops her in her tracks.
ROCHESTER
Get back! Go, all of you - Go! You are
fifteen years too late.
Adele has crumpled into frightened tears. Sophie comforts
her, pale with shock. Jane meets Mrs Fairfax’s uneasy eye as
Rochester pulls her up the stairs. Mrs Fairfax follows.
114

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LONG GALLERY.
Rochester pulls Jane along the corridor. Wood, Mason and
Briggs follow, finding it increasingly hard to keep up.
Rochester stops at the tapestried door. He unlocks it.

114

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 72.

114A

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR

114A

Grace Poole is by the fire. She stands as if wanting to block
their way.
GRACE
You ought to give warning, sir.
Rochester passes her by without a word. He leads Jane and the
visitors through a narrow corridor and up another set of wormeaten stairs. Rochester opens the door at the top with one
hand; the other won't let go of Jane.
They enter an attic. Small windows, high up, too narrow to
climb out of. A strongly guarded fire. There is no furniture
except for a mattress.
Jane gasps for breath. A woman sits with her back to us.
Slowly, she rises. She wears a white shift; black feathers
twined in her hair. Her pose is dignified, she turns towards
the on-lookers, her expression triumphant.
MASON
Antionetta. It is I, Richard...
Bertha sees him - and turns her back. She peers through a
tiny gap in the shuttered window. A fly struggles against the
glass. Grace addresses herself to Briggs and Wood. Jane
cannot tear her eyes from Bertha.
GRACE
She has her quiet times and her rages.
The windows are shuttered lest she
throw herself out. We have no
furniture as she can make a weapon out
of anything. I take her for a turn
upon the roof each day, securely held,
as she’s taken to thinking she can
fly.
Bertha is approaching them. Jane is frozen.
Bertha lays her head on Rochester’s shoulder and closes her
eyes. Rochester, with great sadness:
ROCHESTER
My own demon...
Bertha triumphantly spits the fly at Rochester. He sees it
coming and dashes it away. It lands on the bosom of Jane’s
dress. It struggles there. Everyone looks at it. Silence, but
for Jane’s slow intake of breath.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 73.

Rochester puts out a hand to remove the fly. With shocking
speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into his cheek. She
draws blood.
At last he lets go of Jane’s hand.
Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
her knees, her arms behind her.
MASON
Netta, be calm. All will be well...
Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could express
the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane turns on her
heels. Mrs Fairfax is at the door, wanting to speak - but
Jane pushes past her and exits.
115

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE’S BEDROOM.

Jane claws at the back of her wedding dress, trying to undo
it.

The moon has risen. Jane is at the mirror. Her reflection
with hair loose, watches numbly as she pulls her hair into
its neat bun.
120

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - SECOND FLOOR.

120

Jane steps out of her room. Rochester is sitting opposite the
door in a great wooden chair.
ROCHESTER
Jane... Forgive me. How could I? I’m
worthless.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 74.

Jane falls forward - Rochester springs up catching her in his
arms.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
No tears... Why don’t you cry? Why not
scream at me? I deserve a hail of
fire.
Jane just gazes at him weakly.
JANE
I need some water.
Rochester perceives Jane's inanition. He picks her up.
121

INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER’S STUDY.

121

Rochester has lain Jane in front of the fire. He gives her
water. She sips.
ROCHESTER
How are you now?
JANE
I’ll be well again soon.
Rochester stoops to kiss her. She turns her head from him. He
moves away, stung.
ROCHESTER
I know you. You’re thinking. Talking is
no use; you’re thinking how to act.
JANE
All is changed, sir.
you.
No! NO!

I must leave

ROCHESTER

He controls the violence of his feelings.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Jane, do you love me?
Jane nods, tears spilling from her eyes.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Then the essential things are the same.
We’ve gone to the altar to make our
pledge. Let’s make it here and now, my
spirit addressing yours. Be my wife.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 75.

JANE
You have a wife.
ROCHESTER
I pledge you my honour, my fidelity JANE
You can not.
ROCHESTER
My love, until death do us part JANE
What of truth?
ROCHESTER
I would have told you.
JANE
You are deceitful, sir!...
ROCHESTER
I was wrong to deceive you; I see that
now; it was cowardly. I should have
appealed to your spirit - as I do now.
Bertha Antoinetta Mason. She was wanted
by my father for her fortune. He sent
me to Spanish Town ignorant and raw. I
hardly spoke with her before the
wedding...
The memory seems to take the breath out of him. He sits.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
I lived with her for four years. She
dragged me through all the degrading
agonies which wait upon a man bound to
a wife intemperate and unchaste. Her
excesses fed the germs of madness and
at last, the doctors shut her up. I
was chained to her for life.
Jane’s face is wrought with pity.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Have you ever set foot in a madhouse,
Jane?
No, sir.

JANE

ROCHESTER
The inmates are caged and baited like
beasts. I spared her that, at least.
What else would you know?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 76.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
This is the time for truth and for
trust. I will lay my life bare...

JANE
I earnestly pity you, sir.
ROCHESTER
Jane, it’s not pity that I see in your
eye. It is not pity JANE
I must go apart from you.
ROCHESTER
Be a part of me.
JANE
I must start again.
ROCHESTER
You cannot mean to leave me.
I do.

JANE

He caresses her gently, lovingly.
ROCHESTER
Do you mean it now?
He runs his hands over her, with great tenderness. Jane
offers no resistance.
Jane...

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Rochester lays her down.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
Who would you offend by living with
me? Who would care?
I would.

JANE

ROCHESTER
You’d rather drive me to despair than
break a mere human law?
JANE
I must respect myself!
ROCHESTER
Will you hear reason?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 77.

Rochester’s hold on her becomes violent.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
I could bend you with my finger and
thumb; a mere reed you feel in my
hands.
Jane neither moves nor speaks.
ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
But what ever I do with this cage I
cannot get at you. And it is your soul
that I want! Why don't you come of
your own free will?
JANE
(crying out)
God help me!
All the life seems to go out of Rochester. He lets Jane go.
She pulls herself away from him. Rochester turns his eyes to
her, willing her to remain.
Jane flies up the stairs, along the dark gallery, into her
bedroom. She locks the door.

Jane stands stock still. Rochester tries the door. He leans
against it. Jane goes to the door, leans her whole body
against it. They listen to each other breathe.
Let me in.

Jane struggles on, over the wild landscape. She lies in the

125

INT. EVENING. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.

125

Jane finds herself in front of St John Rivers. The classroom
is empty. Her life is bare. It shows on her face. He is
waiting expectantly for an answer.
ST JOHN
I asked how you were.
Jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and starts to tidy
up.
JANE
I'm getting on very well.
ST JOHN
Do you find the work too hard?
Two girls have tidied all the slates and chalk. Jane smiles
at them.
JANE
Not at all. Thank you girls.
The girls run out. Jane continues clearing up. A bluebottle
is buzzing against the window.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 79.

ST JOHN
Is the solitude an oppression?
JANE
I hardly have time to notice it.
ST JOHN
Then perhaps you are dwelling on
things past?
JANE
When I came to your door I had
nothing. Now I have a home and work;
free and honest. I thank God for the
generosity of my friends.
St John approaches her; speaks intimately.
ST JOHN
What you had left before I met you, I
don't know. But I counsel you to
resist firmly every temptation to look
back.
JANE
It's what I mean to do.
The buzzing fly is oppressing Jane dreadfully.
ST JOHN
We can overcome every kind of human
weakness. A year ago I was myself
intensely miserable. I considered my
life so wretched that it must be
changed - or I would die. After a
season of darkness, light broke. I
heard my call from God Jane reaches out and swats the fly with an utterance of
disgust. She half kills it and hits it again, mercilessly.
St John is both repelled by her inexplicable passion and
offended. He feels she hasn’t listened. He turns to go. Jane
sees what she has done. She tries to placate him.
JANE
Why were you intensely miserable?
St John stops at Jane’s desk. He starts flicking through her
papers. He speaks with a forced nonchalance.
ST JOHN
A year ago, I was weak enough to fall
in love.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 80.

Jane moves involuntarily towards him.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
I scorned this weakness, fought hard
against it - and won.
Jane is incredulous.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
I could have sunk down in the silken
snare and known a feverish, delusive
bliss. I could have squandered my
future upon it.
JANE
You could have been happy.
St John senses the struggle in her. He approaches.
ST JOHN
I wonder if we do not share the same
alloy... You are ambitious, I think.
JANE
What do you mean?
ST JOHN
For a life which has consequence,
value. We’re cut from a similar metal,
Miss Elliott. And this little school
will not hold you for long.
He suddenly snatches up a piece of paper.
ST JOHN (CONT’D)
Is this yours?
Yes.

JANE

His eyes, in an instant, seem to take in everything about
her. He opens his mouth to speak - then checks himself.
JANE (CONT'D)
What's the matter?
Nothing.

ST JOHN

He folds the paper and takes it.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
Good night.
He goes. Jane looks after him, dumbfounded.

126

INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE.

126

Jane is lit by the candlelight and the flames from her fire,
lost in painful memory. Outside, a snowstorm howls..
There is a knock on the door.
CUT TO:
Jane opening the door. Rochester is there, standing in the
frozen hurricane and howling darkness.
Jane...

ROCHESTER

Jane pulls him inside. They embrace passionately. Jane is
actively pulling him towards her, delirious with love and
longing.
CUT TO:
The exact same shot of Jane hearing the knock on the door.
She opens it, St John Rivers is there. He wears a parson’s
hat and woollen scarf. The contrast between the two men - and
Jane’s feelings for them - couldn’t be more apparent.
JANE
Mr St John - What on earth brings you
from your hearth on a night like this?
There's no bad news I hope?
ST JOHN
How easily alarmed you are, Miss Eyre.
Jane starts at his use of her name. He takes off his cloak;
stamps the snow off his boots.
JANE
Won’t you sit down?...
ST JOHN
Thank you, Miss Eyre.
Jane is confounded. St John unfolds a paper from his breast
pocket.
ST JOHN (CONT’D)
I saw an advertisement in the Times
from a solicitor named Briggs,
enquiring of a Jane Eyre. I knew a
Jane Elliott. This paper resolved my
suspicion into certainty.
It is her drawing, with her signature, “Jane Eyre”.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 82.

ST JOHN (CONT’D)
And so I wrote to him. He told the
story of a young governess. Her
employer, a Mr Fairfax Rochester JANE
Mr Rivers ST JOHN
I can guess your feelings but please
hear me.
JANE
As you know so much, perhaps you’ll
tell me how he is?
Who?

ST JOHN

JANE
Mr Rochester.
ST JOHN
I’m ignorant of all concerning him.
JANE
But he has been seeking me?
ST JOHN
No, he hasn’t. Briggs has.
JANE
Then what does he want with me?
ST JOHN
Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr
John Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he
has left you all his property and that
you are now rich.
What?

JANE

ST JOHN
You are rich; quite an heiress.
Silence. Jane is flabbergasted. At last, Jane looks
questioningly up at him.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
Your forehead unbends at last. Will
you ask how much you are worth?

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 83.

JANE
How much am I worth?
ST JOHN
Twenty thousand pounds.
The news literally takes Jane's breath away. St John begins
to laugh at her reaction.
ST JOHN (CONT’D)
If you'd committed a murder and I'd
found you out, you could scarcely look
more aghast.
JANE
There must be some mistake.
ST JOHN
None at all. You look desperately
miserable about it, I must say.
Jane still cannot take it in. She frowns in disbelief.
ST JOHN (CONT’D)
Sit down. I have shocked you.
St John goes into Jane’s tiny kitchen. He rinses out her mug,
slightly fastidious, and brings her water.
JANE
Mr St John... The debt I owe to you
and your sisters ST JOHN
Is nothing.
JANE
You saved my life.
Jane drinks. She is thinking hard.
JANE (CONT’D)
Please write to them. This money frees
them. They will have five thousand
each - and so will you, if you’ll take
it.
ST JOHN
Certainly not.
JANE
And if you would accept me as your
sister perhaps we could live together,
at Moor House.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 84.

ST JOHN
I've told you the news too quickly;
you're confused.
JANE
My only relative is dead..
ST JOHN
You cannot know what it means to be
wealthy.
JANE
You have family - and you cannot know
what isolation means. I have been
alone, always. I never had a brother
or sisters - Please, let me be yours.
A terrible thought occurs to her.
JANE (CONT'D)
Are you reluctant to have me?
ST JOHN
No, Miss Eyre. On the contrary...
I’ll write to my sisters, as you
request.
She throws her arms around St John. He, finding it peculiar
to be held, gently tries to calm her. He is moved. Jane’s
eyes are still shining with happiness.
Brother...

JANE

She releases him. He has misunderstood her embrace.
127

A coach drives off. Jane, Diana and Mary are reunited.
St John stands back, watching their raw emotion, the
gratitude of his sisters, the genuine delight of Jane.

Good night.
He seems to be waiting for something from Jane.
DIANA
Is Jane not our sister?
Jane turns to Diana, mortified.
As she turns back, she finds St John's face right in front of
her. He kisses her. A kiss with no warmth; an experiment. It
almost makes her recoil. He examines its effect, satisfied.
ST JOHN
Good night.

INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM.

129

Jane closes the door. She puts her hand across her lips. The
icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her
loneliness. The tiny bedroom suddenly seems to imprison her.
Then a low knock at the door makes her start. She opens it.
St John is on the narrow threshold.
ST JOHN
I go to India in six weeks.
St John draws Jane even closer.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
I can see what your gifts are and why
they were given. God intended you for
a missionary's wife. I want to claim
you. Come to India.
Jane is utterly crestfallen.
JANE
I'm not fit for it.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 86.

ST JOHN
I trust you unreservedly. And know
this; in you, I recognise a fellow
soul, a soul that would revel in the
flame of sacrifice. Be my wife.
Jane is chilled to the bone by his words. She backs away.
CUT TO:
Jane leaning against the closed door, trying to think, trying
to compose herself.

EXT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE HEATH.

131

The sun is setting. Jane meets St John, walking home from his
parish.
JANE
I’ll go with you to India.
St John contains his delight. They walk along the crest of a
hill back towards the house.
JANE (CONT’D)
If I may go free.
Free?

ST JOHN

JANE
I used to long for a life of action,
to see beyond the horizon. Perhaps God
is sending me this. I’ll go - but I
cannot marry you.
St John couldn’t be more amazed.
ST JOHN
Why not? How can I take out to India a
girl of nineteen, unless she is my
wife?
He dismisses her objections and walks on.
JANE
I love you as a brother. As a husband,
no. My heart is mute.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 87.

ST JOHN
Then I must speak for it. You’ve said
that you will come. We’ll marry. And
undoubtedly enough of love would
follow...
Jane is shocked.
JANE
Enough of love?
ST JOHN
Yes, quite enough.
Of love?

JANE

ST JOHN
In all its forms.
JANE
I scorn your idea of love...
St John is mortified. A slow rage begins to boil in him.
ST JOHN
I've done nothing that deserves your
scorn.
JANE
Forgive me but the very name of love
is an apple of discord between us. My
dear brother, abandon your scheme of
marriage.
ST JOHN
Why this refusal? It makes no sense!
JANE
I earnestly wish to be your friend ST JOHN
You can’t give half a sacrifice; you
must give all.
JANE
To marry you would kill me!
ST JOHN
Kill you? That is violent, unfeminine
and untrue.
I know where your heart turns and to
what it still clings. Say his name.
Say it.

Jane Eyre Green Revisions 88.

Jane hears a whisper on the wind; her own name.
ST JOHN (CONT'D)
Why have you not yet crushed this
lawless passion? It offends me and it
offends God!
A cry, very far away. She strains to hear.
Jane...

ROCHESTER (V.0.)

She moves away from St John.
Jane!

ROCHESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

JANE
(In reply)
What is it?
St John stares at her, bewildered.
JANE (CONT’D)
Wait for me... Where are you?
She looks wildly about the moor. A desperate cry escapes her
as she searches for the source of the voice.
ST JOHN
What have you heard? Why do you speak
to the air?
Jane glances at him, seeing him for what he is; a repressed,
controlling, ill-guided man. She shouts:
JANE
I am coming!
Jane runs further on to the moors.

EXT. DAY. THE ROAD APPROACHING THORNFIELD.

133

Jane is in a trap, being driven along the lane to Thornfield.
She looks well-off and confident, much more mature that the
raw schoolgirl who first arrived.
The driver stops, Jane dismounts, running towards Thornfield.

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD ESTATE

133A

Jane turns a corner and at last Thornfield is visible. But
instead of the battlemented mansion, Jane sees a vast
blackened ruin.
134

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE RUINS.

134

Jane approaches the house. The roof has completely gone. The
great walls and battlements are blackened with fire. Empty
windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred remains
can be seen. Jane gazes in horror and distress. She goes in.
135

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE RUINS

135

Jane wanders into the great hall. Everything is black with
smoke damage. Weeds grow in patches of light. It is silent,
eerie.
Jane peers into Rochester’s study. Through the damage some of
the old bits of furniture and artefacts can still be seen:
The piano, half on its side. Rochester’s chair and there, in
the filth on the floor, a blackened toy of Adele’s.
Jane picks it up, stricken.
A noise reverberates through the house; perhaps a beam
falling, a door slamming. Perhaps an unquiet ghost. Jane
suddenly feels watched. She goes back out into the hall. Out
of the corner of her eye she sees something move in a
doorway.
Standing on the threshold is Mrs Fairfax. Mrs Fairfax looks
more shocked than she does.
MRS FAIRFAX
Jane Eyre...
Jane’s great distress escapes her.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
I thought gypsies were come. Then I
saw you, and I thought, it cannot be,
you are a ghost.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE RUINS.
Mrs Fairfax and Jane walk together through the ruins.

MRS FAIRFAX
He sought you as if you were a lost
and precious jewel. He didn't rest.
And as the days turned into weeks and
no word came, he grew quite savage in
his disappointment. He sent Adele away
to school, cut himself off from all
society. I was frightened to go near
him. He was wretched.
Mrs Fairfax leads Jane into a room that could have once been
her parlour. She has cleared a small area in front of the
hearth.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
No one knows how it started. I expect
Mrs Poole took too much of the gin and
water and while she slept the lady,
Mrs Rochester, unhooked her keys. She
did what she failed to do last year;
set the whole place to fire. We would
have perished in the smoke but Mr
Rochester did not rest until we all
were safe. Then he went back in for
her. The flames were tearing up so
high they brought men running from the
village.
Jane is looking up at the battlemented vault. Nothing of
roof remains.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
I saw her standing on the roof. The
very edge. I heard Mr Rochester beg
her to come down. But she did not. She
jumped.
The drop is dizzying.
Mr Rochester remained, as if he would
not move until the fire consumed him.
Jane is devastated.
MRS FAIRFAX (CONT’D)
I didn’t know... I didn’t know it was
his wife, I promise you. Why did you
run away? I would have helped you. I
had some money saved. You could have
come to me...
JANE
Where is he?

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.

137

Jane is walking the route that she and Rochester took to the
church on the morning they almost married. Her steps have an
urgency.
There, under the broken tree, sits Edward Fairfax Rochester.
For a moment she watches him, hardly able to breathe.
Pilot.

ROCHESTER

He is on his guard, his expression wary. We finally see what
the fire has done to him. His eyes are burned, his right hand
hidden in his coat.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Who’s there?
Jane steps to him, putting her hand on his. Rochester feels
her hand with his own.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
This hand... Her hand...
Jane moves into his arms. She holds him.
ROCHESTER (CONT’D)
Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre.
Neither is able to speak.
JANE
Edward, I am come back to you.
He holds her.
JANE (CONT’D)
Fairfax Rochester with nothing to
say?...
ROCHESTER
You are all together a human being,
Jane?
JANE
I conscientiously believe so, sir.
A dream.

ROCHESTER

Jane kisses him, impressing on him her physical reality.
JANE
Awaken then.

At last Rochester believes.

THE END.
