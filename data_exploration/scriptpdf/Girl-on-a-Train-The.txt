INT./EXT. TRAIN, ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON, NEW YORK - MORNING
We hear a train’s mournful clatter as trees flash by and then
the train itself passes in a silvery streak.
A woman draws an “x” on her foggy window-- looking out
through it directly at us:
This is RACHEL and she is THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN.
RACHEL (SOFT V.O.)
...My husband used to tell me I
have an overactive imagination. I
can’t help it. I mean, haven’t you
ever been on a train and wondered
about the lives of the people who
live near the tracks? The lives
you’ve never lived.
RACHEL’S POV: Out the window: A series of backyards slowly
passes:
A MAN walks towards his front yard.
An OLDER MAN works on a vintage car in his yard.
CHILDREN slide down playground equipment.
A LONE BOY throws a ball. His dog chases after it.
CUT TO:
TITLE: RACHEL
RACHEL (V.O.)
These are things I want to know.
Rachel sits alone, sketching in a small notebook.
CLOSE ON: Rachel’s expectant eyes as the train begins to
slow.
RACHEL (V.O.)
... Twice a day I sit in the third
car from the front where I have the
perfect view into my favorite
house: Number 15 Beckett Road...
RACHEL’S POV: Standing on the upstairs deck of a house, a
gorgeous blonde, MEGAN, wears a light opened robe with only
white underwear and bra underneath. She stretches her back
like a cat. Her curved silhouette is intoxicating.
The train comes to a brief stop at the station and, outside
the other window, Rachel can see work crews fixing the
tracks. And beyond them, the Hudson River.
(CONTINUED)

2.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL (V.O.)
...I don’t know when exactly. I
suppose I started noticing her
about a year ago and, gradually, as
the months went past, she became
important to me...
As the train creeps forward RACHEL SPOTS-A BLUE HOUSE WITH A WHITE PICKET FENCE...
...She quickly averts her eyes from the view of the house-repressing an inner pain. Focusing on her sketch book.
Rachel’s eyes land on a MAN IN A SUIT, red hair, 50, pasty
and plain-- typing on a laptop. He looks up at Rachel. There
is something disconcerting about the exchange.
RACHEL (V.O.)
I’m not the girl I used to be. I
think people can see it on my face.
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
Rachel’s profile has flipped: she now rides in the opposite
direction, on the EVENING TRAIN.
She watches the familiar houses glide past.
RACHEL’S POV: This evening, Megan sits with her equally
beautiful husband, SCOTT next to a backyard fire pit.
Each holds a glass of wine. The roaring fire glows on their
faces as they watch the passing train.
SCOTT spins Megan around and begins to kiss her.
RACHEL (V.O.)
She’s what I lost. She’s everything
I want to be...
Rachel returns to her sketchbook.
INT. TRAIN - NEXT MORNING
Headed back to New York, Rachel POV: Rachel stares at the
burnt out fire pit behind 15 Beckett Road.
Megan is on the balcony in her robe while Scott rakes leaves.
CLOSE ON: Scott as he looks up from raking and seems to look
directly at Rachel.

3.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - MORNING
Rachel’s train arrives and she wades through a sea of
commuters in the Grand Hall. She wears a plain dress and
carries a work satchel.
STATION ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
...now departing track nineteen,
upper level.
INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel sits in a row of chairs getting her shoes shined.
She’s the only woman among eight male customers.
Rachel sketches in her sketch book and sips from a squirt
bottle.
RACHEL (V.O.)
...I imagine she’s a painter...
She’s creative.
CLOSE ON SKETCH PAD: We see Rachel’s hand at work as she
produces a beautiful images of Megan and Scott.
RACHEL (V.O.)
He’s a doctor or an architect.
INT. GRAND CENTRAL - OYSTER BAR - LATER THAT DAY - HAPPY HOUR
Rachel sits at the counter continuing to draw in her sketch
book. The restaurant is bustling with tourists and locals.
RACHEL (V.O.)
He has a good laugh. She can’t
cook.
WAITRESS
(to customer)
Do you need anything else right
now?
CUSTOMER
No. I think we’re pretty good,
thanks.
Rachel is lost in her imagination. All sounds of the bustling
bar fade away.
Rachel eats an olive from her martini.
RACHEL (V.O.)
I wonder what they say to each
other before they go to sleep.

4.

EXT. CITY - NIGHT
The cityscape slowly spins below us as we find the train on
the tracks.
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
Rachel’s profile has flipped again: she rides the EVENING
TRAIN and watches as she passes the urban landscape of
Harlem.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Today her name is “Jess,” tomorrow
it could be “Lisa” or “Amber.” It
all depends on the day, it depends
on my mood.
Later that night, as the train slows, Rachel nears the blue
house (23 Beckett Road). She looks to her lap, letting it
pass.
She raises her head and looks at Number 15 Beckett Road.
...NOW, Megan and Scott can be seen kissing through the
window of their house.
RACHEL
The truth is, I don’t know her
name. I don’t know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh. I just
know they know love...
RACHEL’S POV: Megan and Scott begin to make love.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Sometimes I catch myself trying to
remember the last time I had
meaningful contact with another
person...
Rachel stays on the couple then an irresistible urge pulls
her gaze back to the blue house two doors down.
This time, when the Blue House (23 Beckett Road) appears,
Rachel refuses to turn her gaze away.
RACHEL’S POV: The upstairs window of the Blue House. In it,
Rachel sees herself! Standing in the window in the light of
day.
RACHEL (V.O.)
I used to live two doors down...
number 13 Beckett Road. It was my
first home. We bought it together.
It was ours.

5.

RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel, in the Blue House, turns from the
window to come face to face with a handsome man, TOM. They
smile and laugh as Rachel grabs him. He kisses her
passionately as they enjoy their empty, NEWLY-PURCHASED HOME.
BACK ON THE TRAIN: Rachel blinks: she is still looking at the
blue house.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Every day, I tell myself not to
look.
RACHEL’S POV: NOW, in reality, a woman, ANNA, stands in the
window holding a BABY, EVIE.
RACHEL (V.O.)
But then I look...
Rachel watches as Anna becomes a tiny dot that vanishes in
the distance.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Are you alone?
Rachel looks up to see a Woman holding a one-year-old little
boy.
And now the moment of truth for Rachel:
RACHEL
(polite)
Yeah.
She pats the seat next to her and takes her bag from it.
RACHEL
No, come. It’s all yours.
Rachel smiles at the child.
RACHEL
Your baby’s so cute.
(to boy)
Hi, baby.
WOMAN
Thank you.
RACHEL
Is it... Is it a boy?
WOMAN
Yeah.

(CONTINUED)

6.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL
So sweet. How...how old is he?
WOMAN
Six months.
RACHEL
Six months.
Rachel softly squeezes the boy’s hand and giggles. The Woman
begins to pick up on Rachel’s slurred speech and notices two
little empty vodka bottles at the mouth of Rachel’s purse.
RACHEL
So sweet.
Rachel realizes the Woman knows she is drunk. The Woman
repositions her child away from Rachel.
CLOSE ON: Rachel’s eyes, bleary, blink in slow motion.
Rachel, now seated alone, drinks from her squirt bottle.
CUT TO:
Title: MEGAN
INT. PILATES STUDIO - MORNING
A Living Portrait: MEGAN, the woman Rachel watches from the
train-- up close and drop-dead gorgeous.
OVERHEAD SHOT: Megan lies face up on a Pilates machine.
She grips the hand straps, and with precision and grace, she
begins a series of exercises, stretching her body like a
ballerina’s.
MEGAN
(pre-lap)
A teacher once told me I was a
mistress of self-reinvention...
We widen to see she is lined up with ten other suburban
women. With both admiration and defeat, a FRUSTRATED WOMAN
observes Megan’s flexibility and strength.
MEGAN
(pre-lap)
...I wasn’t really sure what it
meant at the time. But since moving
here I’ve come to understand it...
CUT TO:
(CONTINUED)

7.

CONTINUED:
Title: 6 MONTHS AGO
EXT. PILATES STUDIO - MORNING
On the sidewalk, the women from class have congregated, all
chatting happily, occasionally cutting looks towards Megan,
who takes no notice as she starts to jog away. We see her
running down our quaint Ardsley Village street.
MEGAN
(pre-lap)
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and
routine. It’s a fucking baby
factory.
EXT. UNDERPASS/BECKETT ROAD - LATER
Megan jogs into a long dark underpass linking the outside
world to Beckett.
MEGAN (V.O.)
(pre-lap)
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I’ve been: rebellious
teenager, lover, waitress...
EXT. BECKETT ROAD - MORNING
Megan continues down Beckett Road and jogs up her driveway.
INT. MEGAN’S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING
Megan stands in front of an open closet. Her ivory hand darts
between silk blouses and skirts.
MEGAN (V.O.)
...gallery director, nanny, and...
a whore...
(a moment)
And not necessarily in that order.
Scott approaches, slides his hands down Megan’s side, then up
her skirt to remove her panties. They begin to have sex
against the open closet.
MEGAN
(pre-lap)
I can’t just be a wife anymore.
She is disconnected, disinterested. Scott doesn’t notice.
MEGAN
(pre-lap)
That’s why I stay awake at night,
staring at the ceiling.

8.

INT. DR. ABDIC’S OFFICE - DAY
CLOSE ON: MEGAN’S FACE AS SHE TALKS TO SOMEONE:
MEGAN
...In fact, the only time I feel
like myself is when I’m running.
DR. ABDIC (O.S.)
You always felt that way?
MEGAN
Maybe since I was about seventeen.
With Mac.
DR. ABDIC (O.S.)
Mac? Who’s Mac?
MEGAN
My brother’s best friend. My
brother who died...
We finally see the extremely handsome, dark-haired man who
sits across from Megan. This is DR. KAMAL ABDIC. He’s foreign
with a quiet command. She has been speaking to him the whole
time.
She smiles. She covers her mouth with her hand.
MEGAN
I tend to smile when I’m nervous.
Sometimes, I laugh.
She moves from her chair to a couch across the room.
A moment passes. Finally, the Doctor’s inviting silence
elicits Megan’s confession:
MEGAN
For a year, Mac and I lived in this
hunting cabin. We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that cabin made us
happy. No one could find us.
(a moment)
Everyone thought we were dead.
DR. ABDIC
And if you were to run away today,
right now, where would you go?
Megan glances outside, where she can see the train passing.
The Doctor notices. Megan moves again, to sit much closer to
him.
(CONTINUED)

9.

CONTINUED:
MEGAN
I read once that when a train hits,
it can rip the clothes right off of
you.
After a moment:
MEGAN
I’m pretty sure Scott thinks the
nanny job is gonna make me less
restless-- make me wanna get
pregnant...
DR. ABDIC
And that’s not the case?
MEGAN
When I finish work every night, I
run home, and I get in the shower
and wash the smell of that baby off
me as fast as I can.
Megan stares at Abdic. He waits for her to continue, but she
just looks at him with great intensity.
PRE-LAP: A gentle lullaby, and the sound of splashing water.
A baby’s giggle.
CUT TO:
Title: ANNA
CUT TO:
Title: TODAY
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DUSK
A living portrait: ANNA, pure and sweet, with dimples for
days, looks down into the camera with absolute love.
ANNA
...When you woke up this morning I
went and I brought you back to bed
with me...
Anna kneels on the tiled floor, leaning over the bathtub,
gently washing her baby, EVIE.
ANNA
...And when I was feeding you. We
heard daddy singing from the
kitchen, didn’t we?
(sung to her baby)
“Happy Birthday to you, Happy
Birthday to you, Happy Birthday
dear Anna, Happy Birthday to you!”
(CONTINUED)

10.

CONTINUED:
Megan, her nanny, steps out of the dark shadow, holding a
towel for Anna to place her baby into.
ANNA
Daddy came upstairs with a
beautiful breakfast that he made
for Mommy, didn’t he? Yes he did.
(noticing Megan)
Thank you, Megan.
Anna places her baby into Megan’s arms.
ANNA
There you go.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Megan hands the swaddled baby to Anna who now lays in her
bed. Anna sits Evie on her stomach.
ANNA
(to Evie)
Oh, hello.
Anna laughs as she tickles Evie and turns to Megan.
ANNA
I swear I sometimes feel like my
heart is gonna explode. I mean,
look at her.
(laughing)
Look at her!
The phone rings. Megan goes to answer it.
ANNA
(to Evie, playful)
You’re not sleeping! You’re not
sleeping...
MEGAN (O.S.)
(on phone)
Hello? Hello?
Anita’s interest is piqued. She takes Evie into the-INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
She finds Megan on the hallway phone.
MEGAN
Hello...?
Megan pushes the END button on the phone. Anna steps into the
hall.
(CONTINUED)

11.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
Is that another hang-up?
MEGAN
...Mm-hmm.
Anna, visibly shaken, tries not to get upset.
INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Anna has Megan help her fold a fitted sheet.
ANNA
...and grab the corners. And
straighten.
MEGAN
I got another job.
Anna is blindsided.
ANNA
...You what?
MEGAN
I’m really sorry, Anna.
ANNA
(confused)
I thought you were happy here. I
mean, you seemed happy here...
MEGAN
I am. It’s just this isn’t what I
“do.”
ANNA
...Take care of children...?
Megan drops the folded sheet onto a pile.
MEGAN
Or laundry.
(beat)
Another gallery head-hunted me.
ANNA
(trying to be positive)
...That's great.
MEGAN
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.

(CONTINUED)

12.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
I’m out all day tomorrow. That is
so uncool.
MEGAN
I hate to leave you like this,
without childcare, but...you don’t
have a job.
Anna turns away, insulted.
MEGAN
Ok, that sounded wrong. I know that
you’re busy volunteering...
ANNA
It’s not the volunteering. It’s all
the shopping, it’s spending hours
in the farmer’s market, it’s
finding the right foods for her,
it’s pureeing sweet potatoes. And I
do all of this at the same time as
I’m nursing.
Megan looks at Anna carefully. Anna is exhausted.
MEGAN
Maybe you should go back to work,
too. Mothers need to work, it’s
actually better for the kid...
ANNA
How would you know?
That was a low blow. Megan absorbs it, hurt, then gently puts
her set of keys down on the counter.
MEGAN
Your key.
ANNA
There is no job more important than
raising a child...
Megan heads out of the kitchen towards the front door.
ANNA
(defeated)
Megan, please...
Megan exits without turning.

13.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER
Anna stirs from a nap on the couch to the sound of Evie
crying...coming from outside.
She races to the open front door in a panic.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Anna emerges from the house, frightened, and rushes forward.
ANNA
Rachel? What are you doing? Give me
my baby.
We see Rachel standing in the middle of the yard, cradling
Evie.
ANNA
Rachel, what are you doing?!
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Close on Anna, reliving what we realize was a memory.
TOM (O.S.)
Hello?
Tom enters. We recognize him as the Man from Rachel’s memory
on the train.
He hands Anna some flowers and groceries and kisses her
sweetly on the lips.
ANNA
(re: flowers)
Thank you... Beautiful.
She notices that he’s on his phone.
ANNA
How many times has she texted you
today?
TOM
(frustrated)
I don’t know.
ANNA
(unable to relax)
She called the landline three
times.
TOM
Wow.
(CONTINUED)

14.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
You have to have a talk with her.
TOM
I know.
ANNA
It’s getting crazy.
TOM
I will. I know I know I know.
ANNA
Okay.
Tom cups Anna’s face gently in his hands.
TOM
It’s going to be fine. Isn’t it
always fine? Don’t I always make
everything fine?...
Anna won’t smile. He playfully pokes at her lips until she
laughs. They kiss.
TOM
Who gives a shit? It’s your
birthday. You sure you don’t want
me to take you out tonight?
ANNA
No, I like it at home.
He opens a beer and sets the magnetic corkscrew/bottle opener
on the fridge door before hopping onto the counter.
TOM
Call Megan. Ask her to come back.
ANNA
She just quit.
TOM
She what?
ANNA
...She just told me she got another
job.
TOM
...Shame. I thought you guys were
kind of a good team together...
ANNA
So did I.

15.

EXT. TRAIN - SAME NIGHT
The cars of the train slowly pass-- the glow of the windows
lighting up the commuters in their seats. And here is Rachel-looking out.
INT. ANNA’S FAMILY ROOM - SAME NIGHT
The camera hovers outside the window, looking in at Anna who
eats a candlelit takeout birthday dinner with Tom and Evie.
Tom pulls out his phone and snaps a picture.
INT. MEGAN’S BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT
Megan stands at the plate glass window that lines her shower
stall. She looks out at the moonlight that casts itself
across the Hudson River. Water beats down on her.
EXT. RACHEL’S STREET - SAME NIGHT
Exiting the train station, Rachel walks towards her home,
wide eyes sighing as they take in the bleak Croton landscape.
INT. ANNA’S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
OVERHEAD WIDE SHOT: Anna and Tom are in bed. Tom is sound
asleep, but Anna is wide-awake.
INT. MEGAN’S BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT
The camera floats behind Megan as a naked Scott steps into
the stall and kisses her.

Rachel enters a liquor store.
INT. MEGAN’S BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT
Scott has Megan pressed against the glass shower door as he
has sex with her from behind.
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
Rachel sits in bed. She finds TOM’S FACEBOOK PAGE on her
laptop. She stares at the photo Tom took earlier that night
of he and Anna laying next to Evie.
The caption reads: I’VE NEVER KNOWN LOVE LIKE THIS! ME AND MY
GIRLS! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOMMA!

16.

INT. ANNA’S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
Tom’s phone buzzes. Anna sits up in bed and can see the
caller ID reads: “RACHEL”. She angrily shoves the phone off
the dresser and slumps back into bed.
INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - SAME NIGHT
CLOSE ON: A cellphone sits on the counter, dialing on
speaker.
Rachel pours a glass of white wine. VERY DRUNK. Tom’s
voicemail picks up:
TOM
(outgoing message)
Hey, it’s Tom. Sorry I missed you.
I’ll get right back to ya!
RACHEL
(into phone)
Hey, Tom, it's me. I just wanted to
wish Momma a happy birthday. "Happy
birthday, Momma--”
CATHY, Rachel’s roommate, appears, grabs Rachel’s phone and
presses END.
CATHY
Rachel! Jesus...
Cathy pours the wine down the sink. Rachel grabs at the
bottle.
RACHEL
No no no. No, don’t, Cathy. Please
stop it! Cathy, come on!
But Cathy easily fends her off.
CATHY
Relax, relax.
Unsteady, Rachel nods and softens.
RACHEL
I just need something to go to
sleep. I just need a little bit to
go to sleep.
Cathy gently guides Rachel towards her room.
CATHY
What brought this on?
(CONTINUED)

17.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL
He posted another picture of the
baby. It was a cute picture.
CATHY
Yeah? Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.
Offended by the implication, Rachel pulls away from Cathy.
RACHEL
I got it. I got it.
CATHY
Alright. I’ll just get you to your
room.
They’ve arrived at Rachel’s room.
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rachel crawls into the bed looking around her small room.
CATHY
Rachel, you have to stop calling
them. Okay?
Rachel nods. She reaches up to pull Cathy to sit beside her.
RACHEL
I really appreciate this room. I
do. I thought that I would just be
here for a couple of weeks or a
month.
CATHY
(abrupt)
Yeah. That was two years ago.
But she shakes her head and smiles.
CATHY
Get some sleep.
Cathy switches off the light and leaves. Rachel looks at her
phone.
INSERT: Rachel’s outgoing call log screen reads: TOM (11).
Rachel looks over the times: 11:02, 11:12, 11:54, 12:09. She
lets out a sigh.
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY - RACHEL’S MEMORY
Rachel and Tom sit in a DOCTOR’s office, distraught.
(CONTINUED)

18.

CONTINUED:
DOCTOR
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
Tom takes Rachel’s hand.
TOM
It’s okay, sweetie. We’re gonna try
again.
RACHEL
We can’t afford to do it again.
TOM
Well, when we can, we will.
She rests her head on his shoulder. He kisses it.
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rachel stirs in her bad and a new memory intrudes.
EXT. SCOTT AND MEGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Rachel remembers Scott and Megan snuggling outside by their
fire pit, kissing.
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rachel finally sleeps.
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING
The train surges by along the tracks.
INT. TRAIN - NEXT MORNING
Rachel rides the train as it barrels past homes and
buildings.
Rachel reaches into her purse and pulls out a tube of
lipstick.
She brings it to her lips, but quickly realizes that she
can’t steady her hands enough to put it on. So, almost by
rote, she puts it away.
Rachel catches eyes with the MAN IN THE SUIT. The Man shakes
his head in judgement and raises a magazine to his face.
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS
From high above, the train crawls along the riverside.

19.

INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
RACHEL’S POV OUT THE WINDOW: Rachel sees Megan alone on her
porch, looking out at the train...
RACHEL (V.O.)
I wonder what she’s looking at...
Or if she even sees this train at
all.
...Rachel gives a little smile. A moment of reprieve from her
troubled mind...
NOW, SOMETHING PECULIAR HAPPENS...
...a DARK-HAIRED MAN steps onto the porch, and embraces
Megan.
CLOSE ON: Rachel blinks.
The train stops at the station, allowing Rachel a closer
look.
The Dark-Haired Man’s face is obscured in the shadows, BUT IT
IS NOT SCOTT...
RACHEL (V.O.)
Who is that man?
AND THEN THEY KISS.
The train begins moving again and Rachel quickly jumps to her
feet...
CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
The next station is: Ardsley-onHudson.
...Rachel pushes her way up the aisle, blocked by a few
people who have just boarded the train.
With every few steps Rachel takes, she manages to see another
sliver of the view of Megan and the Dark-Haired Man.
Rachel enters the next car, running to keep her view as the
train departs.
BOOM! Another train barrels by in the opposite direction,
totally obscuring Rachel’s view.
A familiar ache fills Rachel’s chest. She bends over, feeling
sick.
RACHEL (V.O.)
What is she doing?

20.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel exits her train with scores of other commuters,
looking numb. She’s bombarded by images, fast cuts of:
- Megan and the man kissing. We recognizes him as Dr. Abdic.
- Glimpses of a laptop, displaying an email with the subject:
XXXXXXXX
BACK IN GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL:
Devastated, Rachel walks toward the Grand Hall. She passes
the window of a liquor store.
She slows.
RACHEL (V.O.)
She’s throwing it all away.
CUT TO:
INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - SAME DAY
Rachel pours a bottle of vodka into her empty squirt bottle
and throws the vodka bottle into the garbage. It shatters.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK, UNTERMYER FOUNTAIN - SAME DAY
Rachel sits before a beautiful bronze sculpture of three
dancing maidens holding hands and joyfully dancing in a
circle.
Nearby, a BOY drums on a plastic bucket.
Rachel sips from her squirt bottle.
She flashes to Megan and Abdic kissing... then to her resting
her head on Tom’s shoulder at the clinic.
And then to the email. We get a cleaner view. It’s a chain
between Tom and Anna.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - DAY
RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel sits in front of an open laptop
staring at the email as Tom’s voice reads it.
TOM (V.O.)
Anna, I fell asleep last night
thinking of you. I dreamed about
kissing the inside of your thighs.
Holding your breasts. God, I wish I
was fucking you right now.
(CONTINUED)

21.

CONTINUED:
Rachel slams the laptop closed and hurls it against the
bedroom wall.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK, UNTERMYER FOUNTAIN - SAME DAY
Anna walks alone, overcome by tears, trying to banish the
memories.
TOM (V.O.)
Anna, I love you. I love you so
much.
RACHEL
(pre-lap)
When it happened to me, I found
dozens of emails. Tom told her that
he’d never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn’t be that much
longer until they were together.
INT. OYSTER BAR - GRAND CENTRAL - LATER THAT DAY
Rachel sits at the lunch counter drinking a martini. She
speaks to another patron. A WOMAN, 70, who is drinking alone
as well.
RACHEL
I know what they say: “You
shouldn’t check his email.” I was
stupid. But when I saw it was from
the realtor I thought that it was
just spam. And then I realized that
they were kisses not Xs and my
husband was fucking a Century 21
Agent.
She laughs at the absurdity.
WOMAN
That sucks.
RACHEL
It does. Her name was Anna Boyd and
he was in love with her.
SLAM CUT TO:
INT. OYSTER BAR - BATHROOM
CLOSE-ON: Rachel runs lipstick over a mirror, creating a big
X X X X X.
She turns from the mirror where the woman is standing and
watching her. Rachel raises her phone in front of them.
(CONTINUED)

22.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL
(drunk whisper to woman)
Come here for one second. Say "fuck
you, Anna Boyd", but just yell it.
The woman nods. Rachel turns on the phone's video. Together
they shout into the camera.
RACHEL/WOMAN
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
Rachel sets the phone down on the edge of the sink. The phone
still recording video as she continues her rant.
RACHEL
That bitch is living in my house. I
picked everything in that house. I
picked everything. I picked the
dining table, the kitchen table. I
wonder if she knows that I fucked
Tom on the same table that her baby
eats at. I just want to tell her. I
wish I could tell her. I picked
everything in that house. I fucking
picked everything in that house!
Rachel turns back to the mirror. Her energy has shifted,
there's an anger rising within her.
RACHEL
...I could never find the words to
describe how I felt when I read
that e-mail, but this morning, I
did. I did. When I saw that woman
kissing someone else, betraying her
husband, I felt it. I felt... Pure.
Rage.
Slowly the Camera pushes into Rachel’s naked face as the
sound of the bar vanish.
RACHEL
...Like something has been taken
from ME again. If I could... If I
could, I’d just go to her house.
And I’d go in and find her sitting
at the kitchen table. I’d wrap my
hand in her long blonde hair and
jerk her head back. Just jerk it
back! And then I’d pull her down to
the ground and I would just smash
her head all over the floor!
Rachel smears the lipstick Xs into oblivion in her rage.

CONTINUED:
Hold. Rachel stands alone in the middle of the bathroom,
nobody listening, in total SILENCE.
SLAM CUT TO:
INT. TRAIN - LATER THAT DAY
Rachel, her eyes alive with a drunken mission, stands on a
packed train, her body sways with the train’s rhythms. She
sucks down vodka from her squirt bottle.
SIXTY SCHOOL CHILDREN DRESSED IN UNIFORM fill the car.
Rambunctious and loud, their noise consumes the train.
One YOUNG GIRL catches Rachel’s eye, regarding her frankly.
Rachel looks around and it seems like everyone is staring at
her.
Rachel’s gaze careens out the window trying to see into
Megan’s house.
The image of Megan kissing Abdic flashes in her vision over
and over.
The train slows to a stop. Rachel suddenly pushes her way
through the crowd to get off the train, pushing through the
kids and other commuters who block her way.
RACHEL
Move! Get out of my way! Move!
Rachel runs down the aisle and gets off the train.
EXT. ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS
Rachel’s feet HIT the platform and she stumbles forward,
oblivious to conversations going on around her. She quickly
picks herself up and runs down the side of the train as the
engine screams past her.
CLOSE ON: Rachel’s face is pale.
THE MAN IN THE SUIT stares at Rachel from across the
platform. She opens her mouth to say something to him, but
the words keep evaporating off her tongue.
EXT. UNDERPASS - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel leaves the station and looks ahead through the ARCH OF
THE UNDERPASS-- the dark tunnel. She is driven onward by the
Man, who seems to be following her.
She drunkenly cuts off the road into the woods, but continues
towards the underpass. Something inexplicable pulls her
forward.
(CONTINUED)

24.

CONTINUED:
In a mad trance, Rachel hears the click-click-click of high
heels, and sees a BLONDE WOMAN striding purposefully into the
underpass. Is it Anna?
RACHEL
Hey! Hey!!!
She chases the woman into the dark underpass, sees the
woman’s red jacket moving further away, and bellows out:
RACHEL
You whore!
She is suddenly swallowed by the SCREAM OF BLACKNESS.
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - SAME MOMENT
RACHEL’S POV: Details come slowly into focus. An empty vodka
bottle. The overturned squirt bottle. Rachel’s hand, with
dirt under the fingernails. Her sweater, matted with blood at
the shoulder. Her phone, also flecked with blood.
Rachel stirs painfully and we see her hair matted with blood
as well. She reaches for the phone. A voicemail from Tom
plays over the speaker.
TOM
(on speaker phone)
Jesus Christ, Rachel! What the hell
is wrong with you? I’ve spent the
past hour driving around looking
for you! You scared the shit out of
Anna, do you know that?
CLOSE ON: Rachel’s fingers run across her scalp. She tries to
separate some of the bloody strands.
TOM
(on speaker phone)
She thought you were going to...she
wanted to call the police. So just
leave us alone!
Rachel sits up in bed. She looks to the floor and sees her
open purse with its contents strewn on the shag rug.
Blood droplets stain the rug next to her jeans and panties.
TOM
(on speaker phone)
You can ruin your own life if you
want to, but you’re not gonna
destroy ours. I’m not gonna protect
you any more.
(CONTINUED)

25.

CONTINUED:
She catches a horrific sight in the mirror across the room.
It’s a woman with large streaks of dried blood smeared down
her face-- staring back at her!
Rachel realizes that she is looking at HERSELF.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. RACHEL’S BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER
Rachel frantically washes the blood from her face.
RACHEL
Oh my god...
CLOSE ON: Rachel digs the dirt out from her fingernails.
She looks at herself in the mirror. With the blood gone, she
can see the bruises that mottle her arms and legs.
KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK!
CATHY (O.S.)
Rachel, open the door.
RACHEL
Cathy, I just need a sec.
CATHY
Are you ok? Rachel, open the door.
Rachel abruptly opens the door.
RACHEL
I have a stomach flu, okay?
CATHY
You don’t have a flu. What the
fuck, Rachel? I’m not stupid-Cathy slams the door and returns to the mirror. Cathy KNOCKS.
CATHY
Rachel!
RACHEL
Cathy, just go away!
INT. RACHEL’S BATHROOM - SAME DAY
The camera hovers behind Rachel’s back as she sits naked on
the edge of the bathtub, holding herself and watching the
video of her drunken rant.

the underpass.

Rachel slowly lowers herself into the tub.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Close on Rachel during her morning commute, eyes closed,
trying to remember.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
MEMORY: Rachel steals up behind a Blonde Woman sitting at a
kitchen island. Suddenly, Rachel grabs her hair and throws
her to the floor.
FLASH - A silhouette runs through the underpass.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Rachel’s eyes snap open, startled.
She tries to focus on her sketch book. She’s been drawing the
underpass.

The train disappears into a tunnel under the city streets.
INT. CHURCH OF ST. LUKE’S, NYC - MONDAY MORNING
A group of about fifty people meet. Rachel is among them.

MODERATOR (O.S.)
Anyone else?
Rachel reluctantly raises her hand. She stands.
RACHEL
Hi, I’m Rachel, and...
GROUP
Welcome, Rachel.
RACHEL
This is day one, I suppose. I’m
here because I...
(there’s no easy way to
put this)
Because I woke up this morning
covered in blood. And I had bruises
all over my arm and... It’s usually
from when I’ve fallen and someone
has helped me up. My husband... He
used to tell me what I’d done the
night before... And I learned that
when you wake up like that, you
just say you're sorry. You just say
you’re sorry for what you did and
you're sorry for who you are and
you're never gonna do it again. But
you do. You do it again.
Rachel swallows back tears.
RACHEL
And there's... time missing. I need
to remember. I need to remember.
Rachel sits back down.
On her face as David moves on.

DAVID (O.S.)
Okay. Thank you, Rachel.
INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL PLATFORM/TRAIN - LATER THAT
EVENING
Rachel is in her seat. She notices a woman, MARTHA, boarding
with some FEMALE FRIENDS. They’re laughing and gossiping.
Rachel catches snippets.
MARTHA
...It was that homeless thing. I
don’t remember what it was called.
FRIEND
Oh, Safe Shelter... That was a tube
top, right?...
Flustered, Rachel turns away in her seat before Martha can
see her. She remembers...
RACHEL
(pre-lap)
Do you like Devil’s Eggs, Martha?
INT. MARTHA’S HOUSE - DAY
RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel is drunk at a barbecue, helping
Martha arrange the food. Tom talks to his colleagues in the
background. Martha notes Rachel’s drunkenness, disapproving.
MARTHA
Deviled Eggs? Yeah, I do.
RACHEL
Deviled Eggs.
Rachel playfully, but clumsily, walks a plate of deviled eggs
up to Tom and his colleagues.
RACHEL
The classics. Do you want to try
one, anybody?
MARTHA

Those go outside.

Rachel puts the eggs down next to the desserts-- a little too
hard.

She starts tossing individual eggs around the table.
RACHEL
Do you want them with your hot
dogs? Or you can put a couple with
your quinoa if you want. Or do you
want to put them with your other
salad and your corn, and a couple
on the wall!
MARTHA
Rachel-Rachel grabs the whole ceramic platter of eggs and shatters
it against the wall! Martha GASPS.
TOM
Rachel! Come on.
He grabs Rachel and hustles her away from the party.
RACHEL
I’m fine, Tom. Stop it! You didn’t
back me up. You never have my back.
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
RACHEL’S MEMORY: Tom escorts Rachel by the arm towards Grand
Central. Rachel can barely walk. She shrugs him off and
points accusingly.
RACHEL
You never have my back.
TOM
That’s my boss’s wife. You probably
got me fired back there.
RACHEL
I don’t give a fuck. I’m your wife.
She shoves him away, hard.
RACHEL
I’m your wife and you never... you
never fucking support me-Tom staggers back, but tries to settle Rachel, taking her by
the arms.

I need you to focus here.
She slaps him.

INT. RACHEL AND TOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT
RACHEL’S FLASH MEMORY: Rachel, now in pajamas, charges at Tom
with a golf club, her eyes filled with fury.
RACHEL
Don’t fucking talk to me like that!
TOM
Relax!
He ducks. The club smashes into a mirror. Glass rains down.
EXT. CROTON-HARMON STATION - SAME EVENING
Rachel gets off the train, deliberately walking past the
Liquor Store.
EXT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT EVENING
Rachel walks up the stairs of her apartment.
INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - SAME EVENING
Rachel enters the apartment. Cathy runs to greet her. She’s
surprisingly cheery.
CATHY
Rachel, there you are.
RACHEL
Cathy, I’m sorry. I need to get my
shit together. I’m...
Cathy raises a finger to her lips, indicating that Rachel
needs to be quiet.
In the living room stands a female cop, DETECTIVE RILEY, and
her partner, DETECTIVE GASKILL, both staring back at Rachel.
RILEY
You must be Ms. Watson. I’m
Detective Riley. This is Detective
Gaskill. We need to ask you a few
questions.
(CONTINUED)

31.

CONTINUED:
Rachel nods, unsure of what she’s just walked into.
RACHEL
What’s this about?
RILEY
Want to sit down?
Rachel sits, wary, as Riley settles in across from her.
RILEY
Can you tell me where you were
Friday night?
A beat. Rachel, sweaty, searches for an answer.
RACHEL
I was at work in the city. And
then...
(beat)
...And then I went to visit my
husband.
RILEY
You mean your EX-husband?
RACHEL
(trying to keep her head
together)
...Yes. So I got off the train at
Ardsley-on-Hudson. But then I
decided that it was a bad idea.
RILEY
Around what time did you reach that
conclusion?
Unsure of what else to say, Rachel quickly comes up with:
RACHEL
I was back here by 11:00.
Rachel catches Cathy’s eye. Cathy knows Rachel is lying, but
she backs her.
CATHY
Yeah. Yeah.
RILEY
On your way back here, did you stop
anywhere?
RACHEL
No.
(CONTINUED)

32.

CONTINUED:
RILEY
And what time did you take the
train there?
RACHEL
(panicking to keep up)
Um, 6:00.
RILEY
So...what did you do during those
hours in Ardsley if you weren’t
seeing your ex-husband?
Rachel, flustered, has no answers. The silence drags on.
Detective Riley shows Rachel a PHOTO OF MEGAN.
RILEY
Do you remember seeing this woman?
Rachel is shocked to see the photo of Megan.
RILEY
She worked for your ex-husband.
She’s gone missing.
RACHEL
What do you mean she’s missing?
RILEY
Well, her husband said she never
came back home the same night you
got off the train in Ardsley-onHudson.
RACHEL
I was just...I was-RILEY
Do you know Megan Hipwell?
RACHEL
(trapped)
...No.
RILEY
Did you see her?
RACHEL
(rattled)
No. I don’t think so.
RILEY
Is that because you were
inebriated?
(CONTINUED)

33.

CONTINUED:
Rachel shakes her head with little confidence.
RILEY
Just to clarify, you said you were
at work Friday? Are you referring
to your job in Public Relations?
RACHEL
(weakly)
Right.
RILEY
It’s my understanding you were
fired from that job over a year ago
because of your drinking problem?
A long silence. Gaskill nods to Riley: Let’s go.
RILEY
Ok. That’s enough for now.
Cathy follows the detectives to the door. Rachel remains on
the couch, her mind racing.
RILEY
If you’re able to remember anything
else, give us a call.
Rachel doesn’t speak. Cathy shuts the door and spins around.
CATHY
Did you really get fired?
Rachel’s face is pale. Cathy is more curious than mad.
RACHEL
Look, I didn’t want you to worry
that I couldn’t pay the rent...
CATHY
If you don’t have a job, then what
do you do everyday?
RACHEL
I... I ride the train.
CATHY
You what?
RACHEL
I ride the train to New York and
back.
Cathy is now in complete disbelief.

CATHY
That’s what your alimony’s paying
for? Tickets to nowhere? ... That's
really fucking weird, Rachel!
RACHEL
Okay. Okay.
Rachel tries to focus.
RACHEL
I got on the train. And then...I
got off the train. I don’t know!
It’s very unclear...
CATHY
You don’t remember anything, do
you?
Rachel’s face is molested with the realization that she has
no idea what happened.
CATHY
You know, I read about this man in
Long Island who blacked out. He
left a bar and drove to the house
that he’d grown up in...stabbed its
occupants to death.
Her voice starts to distort and fade as Rachel closes her
eyes, trying to remember.
FLASHBACK: Megan and Abdic on the balcony together.
CATHY
He woke up the next morning
oblivious to what he did until the
police came to get him.
FLASHBACK: Megan’s lips brush against the Dark-Haired Man’s
lips, then she kisses him deeply.
BACK IN APARTMENT: Rachel’s eyes shoot open.
CATHY

Rachel!
RACHEL
...What? What?

Rachel darts out of the apartment:

EXT. CROTON STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel runs out of the apartment, approaches Detective Riley,
who stands at her car talking to her partner.
RILEY
(to Gaskill)
...yeah, I agree with you, but-RACHEL
Detective Riley!
Riley turns and walks towards Rachel. They meet in the
street.
RACHEL
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell,
but not on Friday night.
Riley gives an almost imperceptible shake of her head.
RACHEL
She was having an affair. She had a
lover. That’s what I’m trying to
tell you.
RILEY
I thought you didn’t know her.
RACHEL
No. But I saw her.
RILEY
You saw her where?
RACHEL
I saw her from the train. She was
standing on the deck with this man.

(CONTINUED)

36.

CONTINUED:
RILEY
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
RACHEL
No. It wasn’t him. This man was
different. And they were kissing.
RILEY
Wow. That’s pretty coincidental,
isn’t it? You just happen to be on
a train at the same exact moment
that a woman you don’t know-- but
somehow recognize-- is cheating on
her husband?
Rachel just stands there.
RACHEL
I know it sounds crazy, but-RILEY
Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the
vicinity of her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a
resemblance to Anna Watson.
Rachel braces herself for the accusation.
RILEY
Mrs. Watson reported that you go to
their house sometimes uninvited.
And that on one occasion, you
actually broke in and took their
child.
Rachel is shocked at the thinly-veiled accusation.
RILEY
Let me give you some advice. Don’t
go back to Beckett Road. Don’t
contact your ex-husband. Don’t go
anywhere near Anna Watson or her
baby.
Rachel’s mind is racing, trying to replay Friday night, but
she can’t find the memories.
RILEY
Are you listening to me?
RACHEL
Yes.

INT. DR. ABDIC’S OFFICE - DAY
Close on Megan as Dr. Abdic listens intently in the
background.
MEGAN
I lie to Scott. I lie to you. I
mean I know that’s not the point of
therapy, but I have to keep things
vague. Jumble up all the men, the
Exes, the lovers. It doesn't matter
who they are. It matters how they
make me feel.
Megan looks straight at Dr. Abdic.
MEGAN
Lying is like taking a trip. It’s
like having a secret. It’s like
touching yourself and no one else
knows...
Dr. Abdic watches as Megan slides up her skirt and runs her
hand over her panties. She hangs her head back in bliss.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Our Megan of today is having sex in a hotel
room. She thrusts atop a man who is lying on his back in the
bed. We can’t see his face.
BACK IN SESSION: A moment passes. Megan smiles.
MEGAN
Except you.
DR. ABDIC
But you’re just pretending. You’re
just pretending to touch yourself.
Diffused by Abdic, Megan moves on.

MEGAN
Scott’s possessive. Jealous. He
likes to own me. He figures out all
my passwords. Which is kinda sexy.
Megan avoids Dr. Abdic’s penetrating stare.
MEGAN
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop wondering
why-DR. ABDIC
Scott’s behavior is not normal.
It’s a form of emotional abuse. Are
you ever afraid of Scott?
MEGAN
It’s not abuse. Not if you don’t
care. And I don’t.
DR. ABDIC
Maybe it’s become a normal state
for you.
MEGAN
Is it normal I think about you all
the time?
Abdic doesn’t answer, just stands and walks away.
RACHEL (V.O.)
(reading the news, prelap)
“Almost exactly a week ago, Megan
Hipwell walked out of Number 15
Beckett Road and disappeared...”
INT. TRAIN - THE NEXT DAY
Rachel nervously scours the internet for details on Megan.
CLOSE ON I-PAD: Next to an article we see a photo of Megan
standing in front of a large painting in the gallery where
she once worked.
RACHEL (V.O.)
(reading the news)
“...No one has seen her since.
Neither her phone nor her bank
cards have been used since
Friday...”
Rachel looks back to the seat where the Man In The Suit
usually sits. An older bald man stares back blankly.

39.

INT. ART GALLERY - DAY
Rachel now stands in front of the same painting we saw Megan
standing in front of. It is a painting of a woman standing
suspiciously on a train platform. (The Subway by George
Tooker.)
RACHEL (V.O.)
(reading)
“...A wonderful woman. An intensely
private person with a warm heart.
She lost a brother when she was
sixteen, and both her parents died
a few years ago...”
Rachel focuses intently on the painting, pushing in closer
and closer.
RACHEL (V.O.)
(reading)
“Scott Hipwell urges anyone with
information to please come
forward.”
EXT. BECKETT ROAD - NIGHT
Rachel walks along the road. As she passes Anna’s house, she
sees:
Anna in her window, watching her pass.
ANNA’S POV: Rachel quickens her pace as she closes in on
Number 15 Beckett Road.
PRE-LAP: A door opens.
EXT./INT. MEGAN AND SCOTT’S HOUSE - SAME MOMENT
The door swings open, revealing Scott. He is the type of guy
who, despite his distress, seems even sexier when disheveled.
SCOTT
You’re Megan’s friend?
RACHEL
Yes. Rachel.
SCOTT
Come in.
Scott briskly enters the house. Rachel’s eyes drink in every
detail of the home.
SCOTT
Do you want a coffee?

RACHEL
Sure. Thank you.
Scott guides Rachel to the kitchen table, covered in papers.
SCOTT
Sorry it’s a mess. I’ve been
hunting for her social, birth
certificate. The cops need a lot.
Rachel takes a seat at the kitchen table. Scott stands by the
counter.
SCOTT
Have we met somewhere before?
RACHEL
I don’t think so.
SCOTT
And you know Megan from?
RACHEL
Uh...from the gallery.
SCOTT
Are you an artist?
RACHEL
Well, I like to think so.
Rachel notices that there is a slight residue of lipstick on
the lip of the cup-- presumably Megan’s.
Rachel turns the lipstick mark away from her, then steadies
her nerves before taking a sip.
SCOTT
(no time to spare)
So you said on the phone...you
wanted to tell me something about
Megan.
Rachel hesitates.
SCOTT
What did you want to tell me?
RACHEL
I saw your wife with someone...on
Friday morning.
SCOTT
With who?

I saw her from the train because I
commute to Manhattan everyday and I
go straight past here.
Scott represses his reaction.
RACHEL
(hard to say)
She kissed him.
(a moment)
They were kissing.
This lands very hard on Scott. He lowers his head trying his
best to keep it together.
RACHEL
I’m sorry. I know this is a
terrible thing to hear. I know how
it feels.
Scott turns toward her, measured.
SCOTT
What did he look like?
RACHEL
He was average height. He had darkhair.
Scott stiffens.
SCOTT
And they were out there on the
porch?
RACHEL
Yes.
A moment.
SCOTT
Fuck. Fuck.
Scott opens the fridge and grabs a beer. He extends one to
Rachel. She hesitates a moment: she really wants it.
RACHEL
No no no. Thank you.
(changing her mind)
Ok. Sure.
Scott hands her a beer. She takes a long pull.

SCOTT
It could, I don’t know. Maybe it’s
a good thing? It could mean she’s

himself)
She just ran off with someone.
RACHEL
Right.
Scott takes a swig from his beer.
SCOTT
(directly to Rachel)
She talked to you?
RACHEL
(flustered)
Oh no. I haven’t heard anything.
SCOTT
You know her well enough to know
where we live. Megan doesn’t have
many friends.
RACHEL
Well, I used to live nearby... She
and I, we took yoga... we took
pilates together. I think I should
go, I feel like I’ve taken up too
much of your time. So sorry to have
had to tell you that in that way.
Rachel pushes the beer away and starts to get up, but Scott
places his hand on her wrist. She is immediately thrown offguard by being so close to him.
SCOTT
Do you think you’d recognize him
again? If you saw him?
RACHEL
I don’t know.
NOW, Scott grabs his iPad and starts Googling.
SCOTT
There was a guy, a therapist. His
name’s Abdic? Abdic. Um, Kamal
Abdic.
Scott angles the iPad towards Rachel.

Rachel scrolls through different images of Dr. Abdic on the
internet. She pauses on a portrait-like photo of him.

the same man.
RACHEL
(distorted, dream-like)
I remember...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Megan sits alone in a hotel room with two different cell
phones on the bed. She dials one of the phones while speaking
into the other. No answer. She leaves a message. Her voice is
strangely hopeful and broken at once, almost childlike, as
she repeats a strange mantra.
MEGAN
Where are you...?

EXT. WOODS - DAY
Deep in the forest, Megan has sex with a Man against a tree.
The trunk of the tree covers the Man’s face as he climaxes.
INT. SCOTT AND MEGAN’S KITCHEN - LATER SAME DAY
Megan, in the same clothes, enters the house and finds Scott
waiting at the kitchen table-- a stand-off and a portrait of
a troubled marriage.
After a moment, she walks away. Scott springs up angrily and
follows, knocking over his chair.
MEGAN
Stay away from me.
INT. OFFICE OF DR. KAMAL ABDIC - DAY
Megan is totally out of breath, trying to calm down.
MEGAN
(starting to cry)
This is so stupid... He makes every
conversation about getting
pregnant. And every time we go
there...
Megan can’t bring herself to talk.
DR. ABDIC
Where?
MEGAN
To that subject.
Dr. Abdic stands behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.
DR. ABDIC
What subject?
Megan doesn’t respond.
DR. ABDIC
Megan. What subject?
She looks up at him, vulnerable. Then she wraps her arms
around his waist to embrace him.

She tightens her embrace on Abdic.
DR. ABDIC
Megan. All right, Megan.
Dr. Abdic wraps his fingers around Megan’s wrists, trying to
remove her hands from his body.
DR. ABDIC
We shouldn’t...
Megan kisses Dr. Abdic’s hand, then she sucks his finger.
DR. ABDIC
No... Megan... Don’t make it
impossible for us to work together.
She stands and pulls him into a kiss. He resists.
DR. ABDIC
Megan, I could lose my practice.
She angrily shoves him away.
MEGAN
I don’t give a fuck. I don’t give a
fuck about your fucking practice!
He surges forward and grabs her tightly, starts berating her
in Spanish. She struggles and slaps at him, until he grabs
her face to look eye to eye.
A moment as both of them absorb the weird intimacy of his
rage at her.
She smiles.

RACHEL (CONT'D)
Kamal Abdic has been brought in for
questioning on the disappearance of
Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan
Hipwell. He was, according to
sources, Mrs. Hipwell’s
psychiatrist...
Rachel leans over a pool table, taking aim with a cue. A
DRUNKEN GUY hangs behind her.
RACHEL (V.O.)
For the first time in ages I have
purpose.
Rachel hits the ball into the pocket and celebrates with the
guy.
RACHEL (V.O.)
...Or at least, I have a
distraction...
She continues to play and flirt with her opponent.
RACHEL (V.O.)
...I want Megan to show up safe and
sound. I do.
BING.
Rachel looks down at her phone to find a TEXT FROM SCOTT: “WE
NEED TO MEET ASAP”
RACHEL (V.O.)
...Just not quite yet...
Rachel rushes out.
EXT./INT. SCOTT’S HOUSE - DAY
Scott opens his door.
RACHEL
Hi.
He turns and she follows him inside to the living room.
RACHEL
What’s wrong?
SCOTT
Abdic’s been released.
RACHEL
What?!
(CONTINUED)

47.

CONTINUED:
SCOTT
There wasn’t enough evidence. And
because I’m the one that got him
arrested, he talked. A lot.
RACHEL
They’ll build a case against him,
it’ll just take some time.
SCOTT
Are you totally sure he’s the guy
you saw Megan with?
RACHEL
...Yes.
SCOTT
You sure as fuck better be.
RACHEL
I don’t understand.
SCOTT
The police think I did it.
RACHEL
Yeah, but he’s...
SCOTT
He told them Megan’s
miserable...that I’m a jealous,
controlling husband.
RACHEL
I’m sure that they’re just trying
to rule you out before-SCOTT
Abdic told them I’m abusive.
A new realization sets in. Scott leans against the wall. His
voice begins to crack.
SCOTT
When she walked out, I didn't go
after her. I never called to check
on her. I went to a sports bar, for
fuck’s sake, and got drunk.
RACHEL
No. We just need to find more
evidence on Abdic.

(CONTINUED)

48.

CONTINUED:
SCOTT
I’ve spent the whole day going
through her stuff. There’s no emails, there’s nothing, no letters,
no emails. Nothing. For a second, I
thought about contacting Abdic
myself...
The phone rings.
SCOTT
Fucking phone won’t stop!
Rachel is startled by his rage. Scott answers it.
SCOTT
This is Scott... Yeah. Hold on.
Hold on.
(to Rachel)
Do you mind?
EXT. SCOTT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Rachel walks from Scott’s house and sees Tom and Anna in
their driveway getting out of the car. Rachel watches as Anna
goes to the backseat to retrieve Evie... She gets the baby
out and SLAMS the car door.
FLASHBACK: Rachel’s head SLAMS up against the wall of the
underpass.
BACK OUTSIDE TOM & ANNA’S HOUSE:
Back in real time, Anna heads to the house.
ANNA
(to Evie, playful)
Oh, you’re heavy. You’re a fatty.
You’re a little fatty.
Tom turns and sees Rachel. He starts towards her, furious.
TOM
Rachel? No.
(to Anna)
Anna, Get in the house.
Rachel fixates on Anna. As Anna turns-FLASHBACK: In the underpass, Anna, wearing a red jacket,
turns towards Rachel aggressively and strikes her.
EXT. BECKETT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
As Tom reaches Rachel, she points towards Anna.
(CONTINUED)

49.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL
Your wife hit me on Friday night!
TOM
What are you talking about?
RACHEL
Yes. Yes she did.
Rachel clocks Anna staring out the front door glass watching
them.
RACHEL
(to Anna)
Yes you did!
(to Tom)
And then she got in your car.
TOM
No. She said you yelled at her that
night.
RACHEL
No. That is not what happened! She
was in the tunnel. And she hit me.
TOM
I won’t argue in the street. The
middle of the day...and you’re
drunk.
Tom starts to walk away.
RACHEL
(straightening up)
I’m not drunk, Tom!
TOM
(turning back to Rachel)
My wife is scared of you.
Hearing the word “Wife” is like being punched in the gut.
RACHEL
Of what?
TOM
I don’t even know if that’s a joke
or not. Let’s start with child
abduction.
RACHEL
That’s bullshit. You know that’s
not... how it happened.
(CONTINUED)

50.

CONTINUED:
TOM
You and I both know what you’re
capable of.
Pause. They look at one another.
TOM
You were just at Scott Hipwell’s
house?
Rachel searches for a lie she doesn’t have.
TOM
Why are you at Scott Hipwell’s
house?!
RACHEL
Because I’m helping him.
TOM
How?
RACHEL
To try and find Megan.
TOM
You don't even know Megan!
Beat. He softens.
TOM
Rach. I don’t think you’re helping
anybody.
INT. DR. KAMAL ABDIC’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
Dr. Abdic talks to a patient. There’s a newfound sadness to
him. After a night of questioning, he’s frustrated and
doesn’t at all seem like the same man who sat across from
Megan. Finally he speaks.
DR. ABDIC
So you’re here because you want to
uncover lost memories. Is that
correct?
Now, we see that it’s RACHEL SITTING ACROSS FROM HIM. Though
she has circles under her eyes, she’s tried to clean herself
up for her first session with Abdic.
RACHEL
(his accent)
You have an accent?

(CONTINUED)

51.

CONTINUED:
DR. ABDIC
Pardon?
She studies Dr. Abdic’s every move.
RACHEL
Sorry. I wasn’t expecting you to
have an accent.
DR. ABDIC
Well, you have an accent.
RACHEL
(laughs)
Where are you from?
DR. ABDIC
(losing patience)
I’m an American citizen. But I
guess you’re not here to talk about
me. Unless, you are...
RACHEL
No. I’m sorry. I was just trying to
make conversation.
DR. ABDIC
(cutting her off)
The blackouts. You’re experiencing
blackouts.
Dr. Abdic moves forward in his seat. Rachel’s blood goes
cold.
RACHEL
Mm-hmm.
DR. ABDIC
Do you want to tell me about them?
She shifts awkwardly in her seat.
RACHEL
Well, when I wake up, and when
someone tells me what I’ve done, it
just doesn’t feel like me or like
something that I would do. I feel
bad about it. But it’s like it’s so
far removed that I have a... I just
don’t feel bad enough.

(CONTINUED)

52.

CONTINUED:
DR. ABDIC
You want to take personal
responsibility for what you’ve
done, but you find it difficult to
feel accountable because you can’t
even remember it. Yeah?
Rachel, dumbstruck, feels understood for the first time.
RACHEL
...yeah.
DR. ABDIC
So, Rachel, besides drinking-because you clearly drink. You’ve
been drinking today, haven’t you?
She smiles awkwardly, caught.
DR. ABDIC
What else do you enjoy? Do you have
any hobbies?
RACHEL
I like to draw. Art, I guess.
DR. ABDIC
Good. We can try to regain some of
your memories by drawing them-RACHEL
I’ve tried it. It doesn’t work.
DR. ABDIC
Have you ever tracked all the way
back to when you started drinking
heavily? When was that?
Rachel is reluctant to actually delve into therapy.
RACHEL
...It was with Tom. When I couldn’t
get pregnant.
DR. ABDIC
Who’s “Tom?”
RACHEL
He’s my ex-husband.
DR. ABDIC
Do you want to talk about that?
RACHEL (CONT’D)
I really wanted a baby.
(CONTINUED)

53.

CONTINUED:
Dr. Abdic’s arresting stare forces Rachel to continue:
RACHEL
We tried everything and nothing
worked. And it just absolutely...
She starts crying.
RACHEL
It just broke my heart. So I got
really sad and then the booze just
broke us...
Rachel is gutted.
DR. ABDIC
Okay. Tell me more.
RACHEL
I used to watch this perfect
couple. And they were just the
embodiment of true love. It’s like
the kind of love you always want.
And then, she betrayed him. And
it’s sparked something in me...
Rachel has just placed her head into the lion’s mouth. A
moment. Abdic senses an agenda.
DR. ABDIC
(no bullshit)
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Her true emotions take over.
RACHEL
Because I’m afraid of myself.
EXT. BECKETT ROAD/UNDERPASS - DAY
Anna pushes Evie in a stroller toward the Beckett Road
underpass.
ANNA (V.O.)
(pre-lap)
July 5th: 1:33, 1:34, 1:37...
Anna and Evie emerge from inside underpass.
INT. POLICE STATION, RILEY’S DESK - DAY
Anna sits across from Riley with Evie in her stroller. Riley
peruses a stapled phone bill covered in red underlines.

(CONTINUED)

54.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
She calls again 1:38 and then she
calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 PM.
And then July 6th... You get the
point. She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.
RILEY
(looking at the bill)
But these are all from an unknown
number.
ANNA
Unknown is Rachel.
RILEY
You have a log of the calls. You
don’t have a log of what they’re
saying to each other.
On Anna, thrown off by the implication.
RILEY
Look, has she been back to the
house since the incident with your
child?
ANNA
Not that I know.
RILEY
Well, then you might have a case
for harassment in the second
degree, but these are texts,
they’re not threats, so...
ANNA
(interrupting)
She’s been hanging around Scott
Hipwell’s house. A lot.
RILEY
(encouraging her)
I’m aware. There are a lot of loose
ends here that suggest something,
but they don’t add up to much. If
you can bring me something more
solid...
ANNA
What more do you need?
Riley scoffs at the phone bills laid out before her.

(CONTINUED)

55.

CONTINUED:
RILEY
Evidence. Real evidence?
After a moment.
RILEY
You sure your husband doesn’t want
to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
ANNA
What? No. She’s harassing us.
RILEY
Is that what he calls it?
On Anna, insulted by the implication.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
Anna sits at a table with a glass of red wine. She takes a
gulp, pensive for a beat.
The log-in screen appears on a desktop computer, with Tom’s
photo. Anna stares at the blank space next to the PASSWORD
header. She lets out a deep breath, thinks for a second---She types “EVIE,” and then ENTER. A message POPS UP:
“PASSWORD INCORRECT.”
Anna tries again: “ANNA,” and presses ENTER. The same
“PASSWORD INCORRECT” message pops up.
Something occurs to Anna. She downs the remaining wine.
She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves, then...
...She types “RACHEL.” She hesitates a beat. She sighs, then
hits ENTER. This time, she’s relieved when she is met with
the “PASSWORD INCORRECT” message.
Tom’s keys RATTLE outside. Shit.
Anna takes her wine, moves to the kitchen table and pretends
to be engrossed in a magazine...
...Just as Tom enters.
ANNA
Hi.
TOM
Hey.
ANNA
Hey.
(CONTINUED)

56.

CONTINUED:
They kiss. When he leaves, Anna lets her worry show.
INT. RACHEL’S ROOM - EVENING
The news is playing loudly on the television.
Rachel is surrounded by drawings of the underpass and the
blonde woman.
There’s a BANGING!
INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel opens the door, surprised.
RACHEL
Hi.
It’s Scott. He’s very troubled. Completely caught off guard,
Rachel just stands there.
SCOTT
Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere. I didn’t know where
else to go.
RACHEL
Come in.
LATER: Rachel and Scott sit in the living room, holding
steaming coffee mugs. Deep in thought, Scott shakes his head.
SCOTT
The detective just... The detective
just told me something I’ve wanted
to hear for a long time.
It’s hard for Scott to continue.
SCOTT
She’s pregnant. She told her shrink
but not me.
Rachel takes a pained breath.
SCOTT
I wanted a family, but she fought
me every step of the way. We always
fought about it.
An awkward moment.
SCOTT
...Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?
(CONTINUED)

57.

CONTINUED:
Rachel pauses.
RACHEL
(wide-eyed)
She loved you. She loved you in
ways that people only dream of
being loved.
INT. RACHEL’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
LATER: Scott sleeps peacefully in Rachel’s bed.
BOOM! The camera jumps back to reveal a wide shot: Rachel is
standing above Scott, watching him sleep.
Rachel slowly sits down next to him and hesitantly places her
hand on his chest.
CUT TO:
Title: 1 MONTH AGO
INT. SCOTT AND MEGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: Scott’s sleeping face in profile. He turns to
reveal Megan, awake.
Mascara and tears stream down her cheeks. She quietly sneaks
out of bed...
EXT. HOUSE OF DR. KAMAL ABDIC - NIGHT
The door swings open. Dr. Abdic stands there in a t-shirt and
sweatpants, taken aback by Megan, who wears a coat over her
nightgown.
DR. ABDIC
(looking around for
neighbors)
You shouldn’t be here.
MEGAN
(pushing her way in)
I just... I need to tell someone,
just once. Just say it out loud. I
want to tell you. And then I’ll be
gone, I swear.
INT. HOUSE OF DR. KAMAL ABDIC - CONTINUOUS
Megan moves past Dr. Abdic, through his home, searching its
dark corners, until she ends up in his living room.
Dr. Abdic catches up with her. They stand across the room
from one another, in the dark.
(CONTINUED)

58.

CONTINUED:
MEGAN
I got pregnant. I was seventeen. I
had her by myself. She had dark
eyes and blond hair. I expected it
to be hard, but it wasn’t. It was
easy. Because I loved her. I loved
her. I called her Elizabeth. Libby.
(a moment)
...Libby.
(a moment)
It was December. We’d gotten in a
fight, me and Mac. He’d gone off
and left.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Water seeps through the ceiling of a hunting
cabin as it rains outside. The much younger Megan is asleep
in the tub.
MEGAN (V.O.)
(in a trance)
The roof was leaking. I was
freezing cold, so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me, put her
on my chest...
BACK IN DR. ABDIC’S HOUSE: Megan continues her story.
MEGAN
...her head just under my chin.
(a moment)
I fell asleep.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Megan stirs awake in the tub.
MEGAN (V.O.)
I let her go. I let her go.
Megan jumps out of the tub screaming. She runs from the
bathroom and outside the cabin.
BACK IN DR. ABDIC’S HOUSE: Megan breaks down.
MEGAN
I let her go. I let her go.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: She scrambles out of the tub, across the
floor, and out into the freezing rain. Naked and distraught.
MEGAN (V.O.)
I couldn’t look. I didn’t want to
see it. I didn’t want to see her
like that.
BACK IN DR. ABDIC’S HOUSE: Megan tries to regain control.
(CONTINUED)

59.

CONTINUED:
MEGAN
I wrapped her in a blanket. And I
buried her.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Megan hands the baby to MAC, 25, who places
it in a shallow grave he’s just dug.
BACK IN DR. ABDIC’S HOUSE: Megan embraces Dr. Abdic.
MEGAN
Then Mac went out that night. And
he never came back. He never came
back.
They stand alone in his home, holding each other.
INT. DR. ABDIC’S OFFICE - MORNING
Rachel watches the train pass by outside the window, then
tells her memory to Dr. Abdic who listens closely.
RACHEL
I missed our home.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOME - DAY - MEMORY
Anna drifts through the house, taking in the framed photos of
baby Evie.
DR. ABDIC'S OFFICE - MORNING
RACHEL
So one day when I was drunk, I
decided to go there.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S FAMILY ROOM - DAY - MEMORY
Rachel enters the house again.
RACHEL (V.O.)
The front door was open. It’s not
like I broke in.
She feels the staircase banister, remembering, then continues
farther into the house.
RACHEL (V.O.)
And then I heard Evie.
DR. ABDIC (V.O.)
Who’s Evie?
RACHEL (V.O.)
Tom’s baby.

Rachel picks Evie up...

RACHEL (V.O.)
I know this sounds insane, but I
just wanted to hold her.
INT. DR. ABDIC’S OFFICE - MORNING
Rachel looks up at Dr. Abdic’s comforting face:
RACHEL

EXT. TOM AND ANNA’S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER - MEMORY
Rachel stops in the middle of the yard and turns.
She sees Megan watching from her balcony.
The screen door slams open.
ANNA (V.O.)
Rachel? What are you doing?! What
are you doing?
Anna pulls up short, terrified. Rachel is still and silent.
ANNA
Rachel... Give her to me.
Slowly, Rachel places Evie on the ground. She runs away as
Anna races to gather up the baby, who has started crying.
Rachel staggers drunkenly through the tall weeds. Towards the
tracks. The train passes.
RACHEL (V.O.)
I wasn’t going to hurt her. I would
never hurt her.
INT. DR. ABDIC’S OFFICE - MORNING
On Rachel:
RACHEL
I just wanted to hold her.

EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rain falls. Water washes over the root ball of a tipped over
tree. As the soil and debris is slowly swept away, parts of a
body are exposed.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Rachel rides the train as buildings and landscapes whisk past
her. Her profile against the window. Her gaze on someone’s
iPad.
RACHEL’S POV: On the iPad is a news report with an image of a
woman’s profile inside white plastic.
RACHEL (V.O.)
“...partially decomposed body
found... female body found...”
Rachel’s gaze wanders away to another person’s iPad where she
sees:
RACHEL’S POV: A smiling photo of Megan.
RACHEL (V.O.)
“...death a result of blunt force
trauma... partially decomposed...
blunt force... Megan Hipwell...
Investigation now being called a
homicide...”
ON RACHEL’S FACE: Molested with horror.
INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
Tom and Anna stand in stunned silence above a sink of dirty
dishes they have been washing. Their eyes are glued to a
television where an anchor is reporting Megan’s death.
RACHEL (V.O.)

decomposed body fund is missing
Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell...Death
a result of blunt force trauma...
Megan Hipwell’s investigation now

Is there anything that you can tell
us at this time?
Rachel watches from the street. Scott notices her before
disappearing into his house.
POLICE SPOKESPERSON
This is an ongoing investigation.
The police department will release
a statement. Detectives determined
that it was a homicide, but that’s
as far as I’m willing to go at this
point.
REPORTER
Do the residents need to be worried
about violent crime in the area?
POLICE SPOKESPERSON
No no no...isolated incident...
Rachel turns to head back to the station and sees ANNA
PUSHING EVIE IN A STROLLER. Anna has frozen in place.
Rachel rises and walks deliberately towards Anna. Anna
doesn't move.
Rachel clips Anna's shoulder and continues down the street.
Anna turns.
Anna's POV: Anna watches as Rachel runs toward the train
station.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
Tom is behind Anna trying to have sex. Upset and distracted,

INT. OPEN HOUSE - DAY
ANNA’S MEMORY: She’s straightening her dress after a tryst
with Tom.
Her hair and makeup is different in a way which indicates a
woman trying very hard to be someone she isn’t.
Tom’s phone rings. It’s Rachel. Anna’s face drops.
BACK IN ANNA’S BEDROOM:
ON ANNA: Something dark crosses her eyes.
ANNA
Back to this house.

I actually miss being the other
woman. Did you enjoy cheating on
Rachel?
Tom pauses in getting dressed.
TOM
Seriously? Can we not fixate on
her?!
ANNA
(pissed)
I saw her again today.
TOM
Where?
ANNA
This afternoon when the police
brought Scott back home. She was

me she got aggressive.
TOM
Aggressive how?

What if Rachel killed Megan?
TOM
Rachel did not kill Megan.

RACHEL
What are you doing here? How did

Reveal Scott sitting on her couch with a beer.
SCOTT
Come here. Have a beer with me.
RACHEL
I’m not drinking right now.
Scott rises and crosses to Rachel.
SCOTT
Detective Riley came to see me last
night. It turns out I’m not the
father... Neither is the shrink.
Scott gives Rachel a horrible smile. He is totally drunk.
SCOTT
Did my wife confide in you about a
third man?
Rachel has no answer.
SCOTT
Sit down.
She hesitates.

Sit down!

Rachel moves to a chair, wary.
RACHEL
Look, I don’t know what this is

Come on! You and Megan were such
good friends. You must have known.
(softly)
Admit it.
Rachel’s stomach sinks. She’s been found out. He knows.
RACHEL
Admit what?
SCOTT
Admit that you never even fucking
met my wife!
Tears start to run down Rachel’s face.
SCOTT
The Detective said you didn’t even
know Megan. She used other words
too: Alcoholic. Maybe even mentally
unstable?
RACHEL
I am sorry. I was honestly just
trying to help.
Scott’s had enough. He throws his beer bottle at the wall. It
SHATTERS. Rachel jumps.
SCOTT
You’re Tom’s crazy ex! When the
fuck were you going to tell me
that? And now the detective is
asking if you and I are in a
relationship?! You?! I would never
even get near someone like you! My
wife is dead, and you’re lying to
me!? What’s wrong with you?? Who
does this??
Rachel backs into the kitchen. Scott follows.
INSIDE KITCHEN:

Megan’s affair, and you wouldn’t
have believed me if I was just
Tom’s ex!
SCOTT
Oh, well thank you. For getting
Abdic to point the finger at me!
For getting the cops to say that
you and I are fucking!
Then a creepy change of tack:
SCOTT
How are they going, huh? You know?
The sessions?
He nods at the refrigerator. At an appointment card from Dr.
Abdic’s office, stuck to the door with a magnet.
SCOTT
With the doctor?
RACHEL
I wanted to know about Abdic and I
went to him to help you-Scott grabs Rachel by her head and covers her mouth. She
YELPS. He violently pushes her into the hallway.
SCOTT
You’re just a sad liar with no
life. You’re all liars.
RACHEL
(through his hand)
Please don’t!
Scott squeezes harder, then lets go and storms out, leaving
Rachel terrified.
INT. ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON POLICE STATION - DUSK

RILEY
You wanted to file a statement? I’m
listening.
RACHEL
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
RILEY
You mean your new boyfriend Scott
Hipwell?
RACHEL
No. We were just friends.
RILEY
But that’s what you wanted, isn’t
it? I mean, you got him to stay
overnight at your apartment, right?
RACHEL
No. You need... You need the
context.
Riley turns from the mirror and approaches.
RILEY
I know the context. But what I’m
trying to determine is when your
obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant
wife was murdered? I mean, you were
neighbors at one point?
RACHEL
I met him after...

RACHEL
I came here trying to help you. He
just assaulted me in my own house!
RILEY
You were seen in the area that
night. There are several hours that
you say you can’t account for.
This is news to Rachel. Her resolve begins to unsettle.
RACHEL
It was Scott. Scott Hipwell killed
his wife.
RILEY
No. He didn’t. Surveillance footage
from a sports bar accounts for Mr.
Hipwell’s whereabouts that night.
She moves in, quietly insistent.
RILEY
You’re lying. You’re lying.
Rachel is terrified. Riley puts a comforting hand on her arm.
RILEY
Tell me what happened. It’s okay.
Tell me.
RACHEL
I don’t know...
Riley leans in close to Rachel’s face. She’s calm.

She hangs up, drops the test, and puts her head in her hands.

Forgive yourself.
He steps out behind her and folds her into an embrace. In the
distance behind them, the train passes.
DR. ABDIC
You don’t have to be afraid of
being alone. You’re not alone.
He kisses her forehead tenderly.
INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
Rachel is on the train, watching Megan and Dr. Abdic on the
balcony, and we realize:
- WE ARE WITNESSING THE MOMENT THAT RACHEL SAW FROM THE
TRAIN, BUT NOW FROM A NEW ANGLE.
The train starts to pull away from the station. Rachel gets
out of her seat, rushes down the aisle to try to keep them in
view.
CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
The next station is Ardsley-onHudson.

70.

EXT. MEGAN AND SCOTT'S BACK PORCH - SAME
As the train disappears, we remain with Megan and Dr. Abdic.
DR. ABDIC
You’ll be fine. You and your baby
will be fine...
ON MEGAN’S FACE: She has found a sense of peace.
INT. BISTRO - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: Rachel sits at the bar.
The Bartender places a Martini down in front of her. She
closes her eyes, brings the glass to her lips and sucks down
half the glass, the liquor burning her and filling her with
life.
Rachel looks around at the uppity Ardsley crowd. Down at the
end of the bar, she notices The Man In The Suit.
Fear and trepidation washes over her. Their eyes meet. He
smirks.
Rachel finishes her drink. She musters up all the courage
inside her and walks over to him.
The Man In The Suit turns towards her.
RACHEL
Why are you following me? Why are
you here?
The Man studies her for a second and laughs.
MAN IN THE SUIT
I could ask you the same question.
RACHEL
I saw you. I saw you that night in
the tunnel. I saw you there. I know
I saw you there!
MAN IN THE SUIT
Lady, I live here. I’m always in
that tunnel.
RACHEL
But what did you see? What happened
that night? What did you see?
MAN IN THE SUIT
You busted your ass. You fell. I
felt sorry for you.

(CONTINUED)

71.

CONTINUED:
MAN IN THE SUIT (CONT'D)
I tried to help you up. You told me
to fuck off. So, I fucked off.
RACHEL
(growing more anxious)
Was I with anyone? Was I alone?
What happened?!
MAN IN THE SUIT
I don’t know. You were wasted.
You’re always wasted. That’s all I
can tell you.
Rachel grabs him by the lapels.
MAN IN THE SUIT
Whoa. Take it easy.
RACHEL
I need you to tell me the fucking
truth. What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
Rachel can see he has no idea what she is talking about and
her face goes pale. He stands.
MAN IN THE SUIT
I don’t know. I’m assuming it’s the
worst.
The Man In The Suit walks out the door. Rachel puts her head
in her hands. She’s fucked.
RACHEL
God...
CUT TO:
INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Rachel sits on the edge of her bed with a bottle of vodka and
a glass. She stares at her phone. It’s the VIDEO CLIP from
that Friday in the Oyster Bar bathroom.
RACHEL’S POV: Rachel and the woman hold a pose for a Selfie
with the X’s behind them.
RACHEL
(on video)
Come here for one second. Just one
second. Say “Fuck you, Anna Boyd.”
RACHEL AND WOMAN
(on phone)
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
(CONTINUED)

72.

CONTINUED:
Then the camera is placed on the side of the sink. The Video
is at a strange angle catching glimpses of Rachel’s animated
rant as her body weaves in and out of frame.
RACHEL
(from phone)
...I wonder if she knows that I
fucked Tom... When I saw that woman
kissing someone else, betraying her
husband. I felt it.
FLASH INSERT: Megan on her back porch, stretching in her open
robe.
RACHEL
(from phone)
Pure. Rage.
FLASH INSERT: A blonde woman lies prone on a kitchen floor.
Rachel is in the room with her.
RACHEL
(from phone)
...If I could, I’d go to her
house...find her sitting in the
kitchen...
FLASH INSERT: The blonde woman sitting at the kitchen counter
screams as Rachel grabs her hair and hurls her to the floor.
It’s Megan.
RACHEL
(from phone)
...then I’d pull her down...
FLASH INSERT: Rachel SMASHES Megan’s skull into the blue
tiles, blood splashing everywhere.
RACHEL
(from phone)
...and I’d smash her head all over
the floor!!
NOW, Rachel hangs her head in tears, overcome by the memory.
She pulls out a duffle bag and begins filling it with
essential items.
NOW, Rachel writes a note and puts it on her stripped bed
with her gathered belongings.
RACHEL (V.O.)
(reading note)
“Cathy-- Thank you for all you have
done for me.

RACHEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I’m sorry to leave this way. I’ll
send for my things later. Love,
Rachel.”
CUT TO:
EXT. CROTON-HARMON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
Rachel walks down the empty street towards the train station.
INT. TRAIN - SAME NIGHT
Rachel boards the train and notices a group of partying women
board. One of them is MARTHA, the woman she assaulted at the
barbecue with Tom.
CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
The next station is Irvington.
MARTHA
(laughing)
...It’s so true. It’s the worst
restaurant ever. Why do we keep
going back?
Rachel looks down. Then, breathing heavily, she slowly lifts
her eyes and approaches.
RACHEL
Martha? Martha.
Martha and the other women immediately turn to Rachel.
MONICA
Rachel?
A moment of discomfort.
MONICA
I haven’t seen you in a million
years...
Rachel tries to find the words.
RACHEL
I wanted to call you, but Tom said
I should just leave it alone.
MARTHA
Oh...
RACHEL
I’m so sorry...

(CONTINUED)

74.

CONTINUED:
MARTHA
For what?
RACHEL
For the barbecue. I just need you
to know that I don't remember
anything and I just completely
blacked out...
MARTHA
(smiling awkwardly)
Everyone had a little too much to
drink, so... It’s okay.
RACHEL
I know, but with the eggs... And
then I screamed at you... That I
was that abusive. I just feel... I
just feel so ashamed about it.
Martha stands, offers a puzzled smile.
MARTHA
Um... I don’t...?
RACHEL
Tom... Tom said that I smashed your
plate. I don’t... Tom was fired
because of how I behaved.
Martha looks shocked.
MARTHA
You felt sick and you took a nap in
our guest bedroom.
EXT. MARTHA’S BARBECUE - DAY
RACHEL’S MEMORY: At the barbecue, Martha takes her gently by
the arm.
MARTHA
Do you want to lie down? Come with
me.
She guides Rachel inside while Tom watches.
MARTHA
Excuse us...
INT. MARTHA’S GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

75.

RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel opens her eyes to see Martha applying
a wet rag to her face. Martha smiles sweetly at Rachel.
MARTHA
Rachel? Are you feeling better?
She turns to Tom.
MARTHA
You guys can stay the night if you
want.
TOM
No, no. That’s fine. Thanks.
MONICA (V.O.)
I think I’d remember if you caused
a scene...
Tom stares down at bleary-eyed Rachel.
RACHEL
I’m so sorry...
TOM
(cold)
Get up.
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
NOW: This lands hard on Rachel.
MARTHA
And then Tom took you home.
EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT
RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel and Tom approach Grand Central
Station after Monica’s party.
RACHEL
I’m sorry, Tom, I-He angrily pushes her off.
TOM
Stop fucking saying that! I know
you’re sorry.
RACHEL
I’m sorry.
TOM
What’s your fucking problem? You
can’t even focus on me.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

76.

CONTINUED:
TOM (CONT'D)
You can’t even fucking stand up?
What is wrong with you? Can you
stand?
Tom pushes Rachel. She stumbles and falls.
TOM
Fucking disgusting.
He walks off, abandoning her.
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
Rachel tries to process this.
RACHEL
No... No...
MARTHA
Yeah. Tom got fired because he
couldn’t keep his dick in his
pants.
Rachel’s face reddens.
MONICA
You did nothing wrong. Nothing.
Rachel breathes heavily as she starts to remember her past in
a new way.
TOM (V.O.)
(pre-lap)
Wake the fuck up, Rachel! Wake the
fuck up!
RACHEL’S MEMORY: In the hallway at home with the mirror. Now
we see the correct memory: it’s not Rachel trying to hit Tom
with the golf club, it’s TOM trying to hit RACHEL!
TOM
Wake up!
Rachel ducks. The golf club smashes into the mirror, raining
glass onto a terrified Rachel.
Tom gets in her face, menacing.
TOM
You can sleep out here.

77.

BACK ON THE TRAIN:
MARTHA
We all felt so bad for you. Such a
bad guy. Oh god... Are you okay?
Rachel goes pale.
CUT TO:
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
Anna sits on her bed with Tom’s laptop, trying more
passwords.
After a few more unsuccessful attempts, she places the laptop
back into Tom’s bag. It bumps against something.
An OLD CELLPHONE. The phone gives her pause.
She inspects it a second, then holds down its POWER button.
It doesn’t turn on.
She thinks of something.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Anna opens a drawer. Inside is a tangled web of cords and
chargers. She finds one that’s a perfect fit for the phone.
She plugs the charger into the wall, and a second later, the
phone powers ON.
Anna scrolls through its text history. We hear Tom reading
them:
TOM (V.O.)
(texts)
“I need to see you. Meet me at 3.”
“I’m here, where are you?” “I
can’t. Stuck watching Evie.”
Starting to shake, Anna scrolls down through more messages.
Anna hears the JANGLING of keys from outside.
She quickly stands, stashing the phone and charger in a
cookie tin. She shuts the cable drawer and pretends to be
straightening up Evie’s dolls.
Tom steps inside, slightly drunk.
TOM
What are you doing up?

(CONTINUED)

78.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
Picking up after Evie.
He laughs. She stands and gives him a quick peck, but he
pulls her back, wanting more. He sits her on the counter and
kisses down her neck while she stares into the distance.
EXT. ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON TRAIN STATION - SAME NIGHT
A speeding express train whizzes past us. Once gone, we see
Rachel standing on the platform. She takes a breath of
courage and walks from the station towards the underpass.
EXT. ROAD TO UNDERPASS - MOMENTS LATER
Rachel walks briskly up the hill toward the underpass.
FLASHBACK: A blonde woman in a red jacket whirls towards
Rachel.
FLASHBACK: Rachel shouting:
RACHEL
You whore!!
Rachel begins to cry as she picks up her pace.
FLASHBACK: Close on the woman’s mouth-- Anna’s mouth.
ANNA
Leave us alone.
Rachel runs faster up the road towards the underpass
FLASHBACK: Anna charges through the underpass towards Rachel.
Rachel swipes at her, but Anna shoves her aside. Rachel slams
her head against a cement wall.
A flash of searing pain...
Rachel is now in a full run. The memories come faster and
faster to her.
FLASHBACK: Anna slaps Rachel across the face, then sprints
away through the underpass... Rachel crawls out of a drainage
ditch and sets off after her.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - LATER
Anna stares at Tom, watching his sleepy chest rise and fall.
When she is satisfied that he is completely asleep, Anna
quietly slips out of bed.

79.

INT. TOM AND ANNA'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Anna, wearing a white silk robe, stands in the kitchen with
the cell phone. She turns the phone over and over in her
hand, debating what to do.
Finally, she hits the CONTACTS icon, but the only contacts
are EMERGENCY and VOICE-MAIL. She hits the VOICE-MAIL entry,
then places the phone to her ear.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA'S BACK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS
Anna stands outside, listening to the phone.
VOICE
(from the phone)
No new messages. No saved messages.
To hear your current voice-mail
greeting, please press TWO.
Anna hits the number TWO, then returns it to her ear.
MEGAN
(on the phone)
Hi, it’s Megan. Leave a message.
Anna’s heart is in her throat.
VOICE
(from the phone)
To replay this greeting, press ONE.
Anna hits the number ONE again, pressing the phone against
her ear, even harder this time.
MEGAN
(on the phone)
Hi, it’s Megan. Leave a message.
Above Anna, the upstairs bedroom light turns on. Then
downstairs in the kitchen... Anna sees the lit-up window.
Shit.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA’S BACK YARD - SAME NIGHT
Panicked, Anna hurls the cell phone over the back fence.
Behind Anna, the screen door opens and Tom steps outside.
TOM
You okay?
There’s a moment of silence between them. Anna’s unsure how
to respond.
(CONTINUED)

80.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
I thought I heard something.
Neither makes the attempt to bridge the distance between
them.
TOM
You should wake me up if you heard
something.
ANNA
I just-TOM
Come back to bed.
Anna doesn’t move for a moment. She’s unsure of what this all
means-- what she’s walking into.
She walks across the distance to Tom. Past him. Leaving him
puzzled.
EXT. TRAIN UNDERPASS - SAME TIME
Rachel is hyperventilating as she arrives at the underpass.
FLASHBACK: The woman in the red jacket walks through the
underpass, headed for a car parked at the far end.
Rachel follows her, remembering.
FLASHBACK: Teens blow smoke into Rachel’s face.
FLASHBACK: The Man in the Suit leans down over her.
FLASHBACK: We hear heels clacking through the underpass. The
woman in red keeps walking.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Whore!
The woman in red turns back towards Rachel.
NOW, Rachel stops as the memory snaps into focus.
EXT. UNDERPASS - DAY
AS THE FLASHBACK PLAYS OUT IN FULL:
The woman turns. It is Megan, in a red jacket!
Rachel continues drunkenly through the overpass and hears
Megan speak to the man in the car.

(CONTINUED)

81.

CONTINUED:
MEGAN
Rachel’s down there.
And now the man is striding angrily towards Rachel while
Megan waits by the car. It’s Tom. Tom charges through the
underpass toward Rachel.
TOM
(to Rachel)
What the hell are you doing?
He grabs her roughly by the arm and leads her out of the
underpass. Rachel lashes out with one arm, but misses.
Tom shoves Rachel to the side of the underpass down into a
drainage ditch.
He throws her against the wall and she slumps to the ground.
He stands over her with his keys dangling from a leather fob.
He hits her with his keys and then runs back through the
underpass.
Rachel crawls out of the drainage ditch and back into the
underpass. She watches as Megan gets in the car. Tom speeds
the car away.
Two smirking teens walk up to Megan, amused by her
drunkenness. One squats down to blow smoke in her face.
The Man in the Suit walks towards them.
MAN IN THE SUIT
(to the teens)
Hey, get the fuck out of here. Get
the fuck out of here!
He turns to help Rachel up.
MAN IN THE SUIT
You’re okay. You just need some
help.
RACHEL
Don’t touch me... Don’t touch me...
Just fuck off... FUCK OFF!!
He leaves, heading off through the underpass.
BACK TO PRESENT: Rachel sits against the wall of the
underpass, processing what she has remembered.

82.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
The tracks curve past the river with no train in sight. Wind
rustles through the weeds and through the trees of Beckett
Street.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY
Birds chirp. Rachel stands in front of Tom and Anna’s house.
She steps onto the lawn and walks towards the house.
Rachel walks around the side of the house.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA'S BACKYARD - SAME MOMENT
Rachel steels herself as she enters the yard.
ANNA (O.S.)
(to Evie)
Come on. You’re heavy. Hello. Aw,
come here...
Anna is playing with Evie in a sandbox. She looks like hell.
Her face is pale and makeup-less, her eyes blood-shot red.
Rachel appears from the side of the house.
RACHEL
Anna.
ANNA
No. No. No. Go away. Go.
Anna rises.
RACHEL
Anna, please. Please. I’m just
going to stand right here. I’m not
gonna come closer. I just need to
talk to you.
ANNA
I don’t want to hear anything you
have to say.
RACHEL
Where’s Tom?
Anna stares back at Rachel, carefully watching the distance
between them. She doesn’t answer.
RACHEL
He’s lying to you. He always does.
He’s a good liar.
(CONTINUED)

83.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
I know he’s a good liar. We went
behind your back for months.
Rachel absorbs this. Anna looks away from her.
RACHEL
He’s just done it to you-ANNA
(cutting Rachel off)
I know he’s cheating... I know...
Rachel wasn’t expecting this... Behind them, the train
passes. Then.
RACHEL
Anna... He killed Megan.
ANNA
(furious)
No, we don’t... We don’t know that.
RACHEL
He’s dangerous.
ANNA
We don’t know anything!
RACHEL
Anna, you need to leave. You need
to leave. You need to take Evie and
you need to leave. Get out of here.
Anna shakes her head, trying to resist the solidarity growing
between them.
ANNA
No... No...
RACHEL
It’s not safe.
ANNA
I’m not leaving him. It’s hardly
the first time he’s had an affair.
RACHEL
It’s not about the affair. And you
know that, deep down. Anna, please
just come with me.
ANNA
I’m not leaving him.
(CONTINUED)

84.

CONTINUED:
RACHEL
Please come with me.
The back door opens. Rachel and Anna turn to see Tom standing
there.
TOM (CONT’D)
Come in the house, honey.
Anna runs with Evie towards Tom.
RACHEL
Anna, don’t. Don’t! Please...
Anna passes Tom and disappears inside.
Tom shakes his head at Rachel and turns to go inside.
Rachel rushes toward Tom.
RACHEL
I saw you, Tom. You motherfucker, I
saw you! You murderer!
Tom slams the door in Rachel’s face. She shouts at him
through the glass.
RACHEL
You fucking murderer! You killed
her! You fucking killed her, I know
it!
Tom opens the door and pulls Rachel inside.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Tom pushes Rachel into the kitchen.
TOM
You’re un-fucking-believable.
Anna stands shocked in the corner holding Evie tightly.
RACHEL
(to Anna)
Now listen. Listen to me. Megan got
into his car that night.
(to Tom)
You think I don’t remember. You
thought I blacked out. I saw you.
ANNA
(to Tom)
Why did Megan get in your car? Did
Megan get in your car?
(CONTINUED)

85.

CONTINUED:
TOM
No!
RACHEL
Yes, she did.
(beat)
Tell her the truth. Just tell her
the truth right now... You attacked
me in that tunnel, because I saw
her with you-Anna interrupts.
ANNA
(hard to say)
...I found Megan’s phone.
The room goes silent. Tom and Rachel turn to Anna.
ANNA (CONT’D)
I found it...
(beat)
So, all those phone calls... They
weren’t from Rachel...
Tom walks away from Rachel and out into the sitting area.
ANNA
So were you fucking her while she
was here, working? While she was
looking after our daughter?!
TOM
...You were so tired all the time.
He approaches Evie who is sitting in a jumpy chair. He picks
her up and she starts crying loudly.
TOM
It’s all about Evie...
(to Evie)
That’s right. It was all about you,
wasn’t it?
He glares at Anna, pulling Evie closer to his chest. Anna
panics.
ANNA
Tom, give her to me.
TOM
It’s all right.
(to Evie)
It was all about you, wasn’t it?
(CONTINUED)

86.

CONTINUED:
ANNA
Tom, give her to me. Please. Please
give her to me.
TOM
She’s fine.
Anna cautiously approaches, reaching out for Evie. Tom turns
from her.
ANNA
I think she needs changing. Please?
TOM
It’s gonna be fine.
ANNA
Please just give her to me.
Anna gently takes Evie from Tom, but Tom clutches Evie by the
arm. Not letting go.
ANNA
Let her go. You’re going to hurt
her.
TOM
Change her here.
ANNA
Okay, I’ll change her. Let her go.
You’re gonna hurt her.
With Tom distracted, Rachel reaches into her pocket and
withdraws her phone, shakily dials 911-Rachel slowly leaves the kitchen, heading towards the
hallway...
Still clutching Evie by the arm, Tom guides the baby towards
the kitchen table.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS
Rachel places the phone to her ear.
OPERATOR
(on phone)
911, what’s your--?
Tom suddenly grabs Rachel and spins her around.
He grabs the phone from Rachel’s hands.

87.

OPERATOR
(on phone)
What’s your emergency?
He hangs up.
Tom grabs Rachel by the back of her neck and forces her out
of the living room and back toward the kitchen.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Tom forces Rachel back into the kitchen and pushes her down
to a stool at the kitchen island. Anna tries to leave with
Evie.
TOM
(to Anna)
No no, stay. Stay.
They stand in silence. Tom turns to Rachel.
TOM
Do you need a drink?
RACHEL
No.
Tom notices Rachel’s hands are shaking slightly. He covers
them with his own hand.
TOM
Yeah you do.
Tom goes to the fridge and pulls out a fifth of vodka. He
fills a glass.
RACHEL
All those things that you said I
did. Those terrible things. I
didn’t do any of them.
Anna says nothing.
He walks over to Rachel with glass.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
You just watched me suffer. You
made me feel so worthless. You made
me think that everything was my
fault.
Anna says nothing.
Tom slides the vodka in front of Rachel.
(CONTINUED)

88.

CONTINUED:
TOM
Drink it.
RACHEL
You told me I got you fired. But, I
didn’t.
She looks beyond Tom to Anna who is listening behind him with
Evie.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
You know, I saw Martha on the
train?
TOM
DRINK IT.
Tom throws the newly poured drink at Rachel. Vodka drips from
her face. Not backing down, she looks to Anna.
RACHEL
I saw Martha on the train. And she
told me that you were fired because
you were fucking everyone in the
office!
Tom smashes the glass on Rachel’s head. She falls hard to the
floor. Her eyes close. Evie begins crying.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. STREET NEAR UNDERPASS - DUSK
Rachel’s memory slowly fades back in. The moment when Megan
is walking away from her.
This time we stay with Megan as she reaches Tom’s car.
MEGAN
Rachel’s down there.
TOM
Wait here.
He heads down the underpass and disappears.
Megan stands next to Tom’s car. Waiting. Finally, he emerges
from the trees next to the underpass.
TOM
You want to get in the car?
MEGAN
What’s going on?
(CONTINUED)

89.

CONTINUED:
TOM
Don’t worry about it. Come on.
They drive away.
At the other end of the underpass, Rachel drags herself out
of the ditch and watches them leave.
INT. TOM’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Tom glances over at Megan.
TOM
Okay, I’m here. What is it?
MEGAN
I just want to go to the woods.
Megan stares out the window at the trees as they drive deeper
into the woods. Rain drops obscure the image. There’s a
sadness to Megan.
EXT. FOREST - DUSK
Tom and Megan walk through the trees in the rain. Megan leads
him.
TOM’S POV: Megan runs ahead and turns around, smiling like a
siren.
TOM
(playful)
What is it with you crazy women?
NOW, Megan leans against the tree that she and Tom had sex
against.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Megan has sex against the tree. But now the
Man’s face is no longer obscured. We see it is Tom.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Megan and Tom have sex in the hotel room.
MEGAN’S MEMORY: Tom has sex with Megan in the nursery, Evie
watching from her crib. A music box lullaby plays.
BACK IN FOREST:
Tom is now pressed up against Megan. He kisses her.
The lullaby continues in the background. Water drips from a
branch onto Megan’s face, bringing her back to herself.
TOM
Is this what you want?
(CONTINUED)

90.

CONTINUED:
He unbuttons his pants and begins to tug at her jeans.
MEGAN
No.
Tom smirks and spins her around so she’s facing the tree.
TOM
Like this?
Megan gently pushes him back and turns to him. A moment.
Megan struggles with how to articulate something.
TOM
What?
MEGAN
I’m pregnant.
Tom’s face is blank. Megan says nothing.
TOM
Congratulations.
MEGAN
I thought you should know.
TOM
You thought I should know?
MEGAN
There’s a chance it could be yours.
Tom stares at her a beat.
TOM
Then get an abortion. Or if it’s
Scott’s, do whatever you want. But
if it’s not then... Get rid of it.
Tom walks away from Megan at the tree.
Megan crosses from the tree.
MEGAN
You can be as involved as you want.
Tom tenses up.
TOM
(softening)
You’re a shitty nanny. What makes
you think you’re gonna be a good
mother?
(CONTINUED)

91.

CONTINUED:
MEGAN
Why did you bring me there in the
first place?
TOM
Because I thought it would be fun
to have you both around.
Tom grabs Megan’s hand and tries to pull her back to the car.
Megan yanks away.
MEGAN
I played your game so you could
fuck me in between Evie’s
playdates.
TOM
I don’t need another kid. Certainly
not with you.
He turns and starts to walk away.
MEGAN
I took care of your kid to be near
you!
Megan pushes Tom hard. He stumbles forward and onto the
ground.
MEGAN
You fucked Anna because you
couldn’t fuck Rachel anymore! And
you fucked me because you couldn’t
fuck Anna! Take us all away and
you’re just a pathetic, impotent
man!
Tom shoves Megan backwards into the ground. HER HEAD SLAMS
INTO A ROCK. Blood spills onto the forest floor.
Tom stands over Megan. All is silent.
She’s dizzy and disoriented. After a moment MEGAN
You’re not gonna get rid of me.
You’re gonna pay for this child for
the rest of your life-Tom raises his foot and smashes his heel HARD into Megan’s
head. Then he raises his foot and does it again.
Megan lies still.

(CONTINUED)

92.

Tom looks around to see that they’re alone. He grabs Megan by
her feet and drags her back to the uprooted tree.
Tom shoves Megan under the root ball. She stirs. Her eyes
look back at him. She begins to SCREAM.
Tom spots a rock on the forest floor.
A resolve settles on Tom’s face. He has to finish this. He
grips the rock... He leans under the root ball and smashes
Megan’s head again. And again.
INT. TOM AND ANNA'S KITCHEN - DAY
CLOSE ON: Rachel’s face resting on the kitchen floor. Slowly
she opens her eyes and sees Tom on the couch. He gazes at
her. After a long pause-TOM
You’re like a dog. Like one of
those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
You can kick them, but they keep
coming back to you. Thinking that
somehow if they’re good-RACHEL
You’re not doing this again.
TOM
--you’ll love them.
Weak, Rachel manages to sit, her back against the kitchen
counter.
RACHEL
This is what you do. You’re not
doing this to me.
TOM
You brought this on yourself,
Rachel. If you had just stayed away
that one night... Just left us all
alone. You brought this on Megan...
In a way, you killed her.
A long silence between them.
RACHEL
But I didn’t.
(beat)
You did.
Rachel BOLTS out of the kitchen, grabbing the corkscrew off
the refrigerator.
(CONTINUED)

93.

CONTINUED:
Just as she reaches the front door, Tom catches her and
begins to choke her. Dropping the cork-screw, Rachel tries to
pry his hands from her neck.
TOM
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Still choking her, Tom drives her to her knees. Rachel looks
up the stairs to see... Anna-- staring blankly as Tom
continues to choke Rachel.
Rachel pleads for help with her eyes but Anna just stares
back with little emotion.
TOM
Do you have any idea what it’s like
to be married to a fucking blur?
Tom forces her head to the floor. Quickly losing
consciousness, Rachel flails her arms, searching for the
corkscrew. Her hand finds an umbrella stand. She grabs the
leg of the stand and swings the entire unit toward Tom,
striking his head.
Dazed, Tom lets go. Grabbing the corkscrew, Rachel runs back
down the hall and out the back door.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
Rachel runs through the backyard, towards the back fence and
the train tracks.
Tom chases after, catches up to her, and grabs her by the
arm. He yanks her backwards, HARD. Rachel reels on him,
swinging her other arm around toward him with a clenched
fist...
JAMMING THE CORKSCREW INTO TOM’S NECK.
...Tom stares straight at Rachel. Blood spurts from his
wound!
Still standing Tom leans into Rachel. Each is forced to place
their arms around each other in an awkward embrace. Blood
continues to flow from his neck.
Together they lower to their knees on the lawn.
Anna watches in shock from the upstairs window.
Rachel lets go of Tom. He falls to the ground.
Rachel rises and turns to the train as it barrels past on the
tracks.
(CONTINUED)

94.

CONTINUED:
Rachel turns to see Anna walking towards a squirming Tom. The
women lock eyes.
Anna falls to her knees beside Tom.
Rachel slowly approaches.
Anna is not trying to stop the bleeding at all...
...INSTEAD ANNA IS TWISTING THE CORKSCREW DEEPER AND DEEPER
INTO TOM’S NECK.
Tom dies. Anna stands. The two women face each other in
silence.
EXT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LATER
Detectives Riley and Gaskill escort Anna and Rachel to a
waiting squad car.
Rachel looks up to see Scott standing in the lawn next door.
Scott stares at Rachel stopping her in her tracks.
She and Scott share a knowing look. Without words, much is
said and forgiven.
INT. POLICE STATION - LATER SAME DAY
Riley and two Police Officers lead Rachel and Anna into the
station.
As they are led into different rooms, Rachel and Anna share
one final glance.
They are now tied together, forever bound, by the stories
they tell.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
Riley and Gaskill videotape Rachel’s statement.
RACHEL
I had no choice. He was... He would
have killed me. I never wanted to
hurt him. It was self-defense.
Pushing in on Riley, we turn to see Anna is now at the table,
giving her statement.
ANNA
She had no choice. Tom would have
killed her. I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan. She
was right about everything.

95.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
Rachel, looking more put together than we’ve seen, makes her
way towards a low headstone: “MEGAN HIPWELL 1990-2016”
She silently pays her respects.
RACHEL (V.O.)
We are tied forever now, the three
of us.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK, UNTERMYER FOUNTAIN - DAY
Rachel sits, sketching before the Dancing Maids Fountain. The
fountain isn’t flowing.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Bound forever by the story we
share.
CLOSE SHOTS ON: The Three Maid’s faces and dancing bodies,
preserved as a relic of the past.
EXT. TRAIN TRACK, ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON - MORNING
Trees blur as the train rolls by.
INT. TRAIN - SAME TIME
Rachel sits looking out the window of the train. She sees the
houses on Beckett Road drift by as the train passes, then
turns to look out the other window.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead. Anything is
possible. Because I am not the girl
I used to be.
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - SAME
The train continues onward, curving along the river to
disappear beyond the trees.
FADE OUT.
