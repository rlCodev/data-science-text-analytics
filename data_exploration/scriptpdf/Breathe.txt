EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

FLYING OVER England, the green rolling Chiltern hills, over
woodland and villages and country houses.
The CAMERA FINDS a handsome manor house. In the field by the
house, a cricket match is in full swing.

EXT. CRICKET FIELD - DAY
MOVING POV - A blur of tree trunks. Railings round a
pavilion terrace. Glimpses of women drinking tea on a sunny
English afternoon. Sounds of a cricket match in progress.
The UNKNOWN WATCHER is on the move, trying for a better
vantage point. Now at last he catches a clear sighting of DIANA, a beautiful young woman, 22 years old, dark hair,
calm manner. She’s seated on the pavilion terrace,
surrounded by others but looking as if she’s alone. A young
man, TOMMY, is clearly trying to talk to her, one hand
nervously fiddling with his straw hat as he does so. Diana
seems unaware of his existence.
Some other figure crosses the line of vision, obscuring
her. The MOVING POV shifts again. This time the watcher
gets an even better view of her.
ROBIN (O.S.)
Dear God. What - is - that?
ON ROBIN CAVENDISH, staring. A good-looking 25-year-old,
dressed in cricketing whites, wearing pads. With him, also
in whites, his friend COLIN CAMPBELL.
COLIN CAMPBELL
Not a chance.
ROBIN
(gazing at Diana)
How so?
COLIN CAMPBELL
She’s a famous heart-breaker.

ROBIN
Do you know her?
COLIN CAMPBELL
I know her brothers.
A glance towards two young men watching the cricket,
identical twins BLOGGS and DAVID BLACKER. They too are
watching Diana, amused by Tommy’s utter failure to attract
Diana’s attention. They’re mimicking the way his hand fiddles
with his hat.
Robin’s gaze turns from the twins back to Diana. The sounds
of a wicket being taken, and the clapping of the
spectators.
ROBIN
She’s gorgeous.
COLIN CAMPBELL
No one’s ever got near. Martin
proposed twice.
ROBIN
Would you marry Martin? I wouldn’t.
But I would marry me.
COLIN CAMPBELL
And I’m sure you’d be very happy
together, Robin.
ROBIN
The thing is, I’m running out of
time. I leave for Nairobi on July
15th. I need a wife.
It’s now his turn to bat. Smiling, confident, he strides out
to the crease.

EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY
Robin prepares to face the bowler. He glances back at Diana
on the pavilion terrace: he’s going to make her notice him.
But Diana’s only half-watching. She’s bored. Tommy has
given up.
The ball hurtles towards Robin. He steps forward, smashes
the ball with a sweeping off-drive. It sails over the
pavilion for a glorious six. A cheer goes up.
Diana is chatting to a girlfriend. She didn’t even notice
Robin’s triumph.

Robin with a cup of tea in his hand moving past team mates
and supporters, accepting congratulations as he goes. He’s
heading for Diana. She sits staring far away at nothing.
Still bored.
He comes to a stop beside her. She doesn’t register his
presence. He drinks his tea, watches her.
ROBIN
I know you can see me.
Diana turns her lazy gaze to take him in.
I’m sorry?

DIANA

ROBIN
I don’t believe you’re half as
bored as you look.
DIANA
Do I look bored? I don’t mean to.
ROBIN
Cricket’s a lot more fun to play
than to watch.
DIANA
Yes. I suppose it is.
ROBIN
Like life, you might say.
Might you?

DIANA

An older friend, HARRY TENNYSON, comes up to Diana. Harry is
very overweight, and just walking gets him out of breath.
HARRY TENNYSON
We’re off. If you want a lift it’s
now or never.
Diana gets up.
I’m ready.

ROBIN
Will you be at the Barings’ bash on
Saturday?
DIANA
I might be.

MOVING POV - Through the throng of guests at the ball:
glimpses of Diana, stunning in a formal gown. On her lovely
face the same air of not seeing the bustle round her; of
living in some other private world.
Robin, smart in his formal evening clothes, tracks her with
his eyes. He moves steadily towards her. She turns, catches
his gaze. Holds the look for a moment, then turns away.
He reaches her. She shows no sign of noticing him.
ROBIN
I could ask you to dance. You
could say you don’t feel like
dancing right now. I could say,
Next time, maybe. And I could
saunter away.
DIANA
You could saunter away.
ROBIN
Or I could just not ask.
That’s unexpected. She looks at him, unsure what he means.
He takes her hand and pulls her onto the dance floor.
She’s too taken by surprise to resist. Before she knows
what’s happening they’re dancing.
He dances very well. She lets him lead her, looking at him
with an amused quizzical look. She likes dancing with him.

DIANA
So where are we going?
ROBIN
I thought Maidenhead. I know a
rather jolly pub by the river.
The car turns off into a lane that winds up a hill between
trees, to come to a stop facing a giant vista of rolling
countryside. Robin’s favourite view.
DIANA
This doesn’t look like a jolly
pub by the river.
ROBIN
No. We seem to have missed our
way.
DIANA
What a surprise.
ROBIN
Lucky I packed a bottle of wine
and a pork pie.
DIANA
Good Lord, is that the time?
She reaches for the car door handle. There is no car door
handle.
DIANA
How do you open the door?
You don’t.

ROBIN

DIANA
But I want to get out.
ROBIN
No you don’t.
Don’t I?

DIANA

ROBIN
You want to kiss me.
DIANA
What makes you think I want to He pulls her towards him and kisses her. No aggression, but
nor does he give her any choice in the matter.

For a moment she accepts the kiss passively. Then she
starts to kiss him back. Then she starts to kiss him with
real passion.

EXT. GARDEN, BLACKER HOUSE - DAY

The grounds of Diana’s family home. Diana sits on a swing
attached to a branch of a tree. She’s slowly twisting herself
round and round, winding the two ropes above her. At her feet
on the grass lie her brothers, Bloggs and David.
BLOGGS
(to Diana)
You hardly know the little man.
DAVID
(to Bloggs)
Would you say he’s littler than us?
The two brothers eye each other, as if making the mental
comparison.
BLOGGS
Not much in it.
DAVID
(to Diana)
Has he got any money at all?
BLOGGS
It’s not like you don’t have other
options.
DAVID
What happened to Hugh? Doesn’t he
have a castle in Scotland?
BLOGGS
Mind you, who’d want to live in
Scotland?
DAVID
She’s talking about going to live
in Kenya, for God’s sake!
BLOGGS
Diana, please stop going round and
round and concentrate. This is your
future life we’re talking about.
DAVID
Your future happiness.
Diana stops twirling. Her feet on the ground hold the swing
steady.

it heads into deep country The sound of CRASHING in the trees An ELEPHANT lumbers out into the track just ahead,
frighteningly close. The MOVING POV screeches to a halt. The
elephant continues across the track, followed by another, and
another.
In the Landrover Diana sits very still, captivated by the
sight. Robin has his camera out, taking photographs. The herd
of elephants passes in front of and behind their vehicles,
thrillingly close.

Robin and Diana are out walking in the bush with their
friends COLIN CAMPBELL, Dr DON MCQUEEN, MARY DAWNAY and
KATHERINE BARING, all young people of their own age.
They’re on the lookout for wild animals. Both Robin and Colin
carry guns. The women walk behind. Robin is entranced by the
immense view.
KATHERINE
What is it you actually do out
here, Robin?
ROBIN
I’m a tea broker. I get tea and I
broke it. It’s very skilled work.
KATHERINE
And what does Diana do while you’re
off broking?
ROBIN
She comes too.
MARY DAWNAY
My God! That’s almost indecent.
DIANA
I like it. Really.
MARY DAWNAY
God gave men jobs to do so women
could get a little time to
themselves.
DIANA
I like being with Robin. He’s
really quite bearable.
COLIN CAMPBELL
I can’t see it myself. It’s all a
mystery to me.
DON MCQUEEN
What Colin means is, how on earth
did Robin manage to nab Diana?
MARY DAWNAY
Oh we’d all like to know that.
DIANA
I don’t know. How did you, darling?
ROBIN
It’s very simple, really. Diana is
bone idle. She hates having to make
decisions.

fever trees, sharing a picnic supper. Diana lies with her
head on Robin’s lap. Robin holds up his hand to ask for
silence. Nothing but the sounds of dusk.
ROBIN
You hear that?
COLIN CAMPBELL
What? I don’t hear a thing.
ROBIN
That’s just it. It’s like the dawn
of creation.
MARY DAWNAY
The dusk of creation, you mean.
COLIN CAMPBELL
Watch out, Robin. Africa does funny
things to people. (To Diana) Has he
started talking to God?
DIANA
Not exactly talking. But Robin and
God are quite chummy.
DON MCQUEEN
You need faith to survive out here.
MARY DAWNAY
How can you say that, Don? And you

DON MCQUEEN
Oh, I believe in the power of the
mind. Did you hear about the
African prisoners on Kome Island?
During the Mau-Mau rebellion? There
were sixty of them crammed into a
small tin hut. Prison officer
wouldn’t let them out. The Mau-Mau
leader said, very well, I give my
men permission to die. Next morning
all sixty were dead.
How?

Mind power. They chose to die.
Turned their faces to the wall and
died.

fanning herself with a sales document at one end.
Robin is inspecting the tea with a white ESTATE MANAGER.
ESTATE MANAGER
The Dark Amber is as good as you’ll
get this year. Take a sniff of
that.
Robin smells the crumbled leaf. A black servant brings a tray
of tea - pot and three cups - and sets it down beside Diana.
ESTATE MANAGER
This one’s Milima Estate. More
subtle fragrance, but it hasn’t got
the depth.
Robin smells the second type.
ROBIN
What do you drink?
ESTATE MANAGER
Oh, I drink Nairobi Chai. But it’s
too black for the home market.
The Estate Manager crosses to the teapot beside Diana. He
smells the tea in the pot, and pours.
ESTATE MANAGER
We don’t usually get wives on these
buying trips, Mrs Cavendish.
DIANA
It’s Robin’s business. I want to
know about it.
ESTATE MANAGER
Secret of a happy marriage, eh?
Never let hubby out of your sight.
Diana blinks at this. The Estate Manager is quite unaware of
his crassness. He shows Robin the tea in the cup.
ESTATE MANAGER
You see the golden colour of the
liquor? That’s top grade. Top
price. Pure blonde.

Gentlemen prefer blondes.

Mary is good, swinging with her hips, making the hoop spin.
A small crowd of friends look on and applaud. Black
servants grin from the terrace.
Katherine is not so good. She steps out of her hoop as
Robin and Colin join them.
KATHERINE BARING

bump. Robin staggers slightly as he swings his hips. The
hoop drops to the ground again.

He turns to Diana. She’s not smiling any more: watching
him, puzzled. He grins, moves towards her, gives his body a
shake as if to wake it up.

Don McQueen stands at a chart showing a cutaway view of the

happened. Diana, very pregnant, sits on a chair.
DON MCQUEEN
You inhale the virus from
droplets in the air, the same way
you catch a cold. It passes into
the blood stream, into the
central nervous system, and
attacks a group of big cells in
the spinal cord. The anterior
horn cells. These are the cells
that control the voluntary muscle
system. The result is you become
like a rag doll. You can’t move
anything from the neck down. You
can’t even breathe for yourself.
He stops. Silence, while they take it in.

The paralysis is irreversible. A
good respiration system will
maintain life for a while. We’re
talking a matter of months.

Medics, RAF personnel and ground crew are gathered round.

respirator is heaved into the ambulance, and the sounds of

JONATHAN’S POV - Crossing the room towards his father’s bed,
looming above him. Peering at the fascinating machine by the
bed, that hisses to itself.
Jonathan mimics the machine’s wheezing sound.
Benjy comes trotting in. Jonathan tries to take Benjy in his
arms but the dog wriggles free. Jonathan topples over, trying
to get him back. As he scrabbles about on the floor he pulls
unknowingly on the power cord.
The respirator stops.
Robin, helpless in bed, makes a clicking noise in his mouth:
his distress signal.
Jonathan, entirely unaware of the crisis, chases after Benjy.
Dog and child run out of the room.
Robin’s eyes show his mounting fear. He keeps making the
clicking noise. He can hear the radio playing in the kitchen.

walks alongside, watching closely to see that Robin’s
breathing tube stays in, and that the pump keeps pumping.
It makes a gentler sound than the static respirator. Tid
and Jonathan and Benjy follow behind.
On the terrace a small crowd of friends applaud: Bloggs and

Diana wheels Robin in his wheelchair into the hospital lobby.

We have an appointment with Dr
Khan. Robin Cavendish, for his
check-up.
IN HALLWAY - Diana wheels Robin down a hallway and into a
ward. This is the same ward from which he escaped, still
occupied by many of the same paralysed patients on
respirators. As Diana wheels Robin between the beds, the
patients stare. Some are amazed, but some look confused, even
distressed. Robin’s former neighbour Paddy is grinning all
over his face. Beside him stands Nurse Margaret, also looking
on in wonder.
Robin says to Diana ROBIN
Take me to Paddy... Hey, Paddy!
PADDY
Robin!... You jammy little beggar!
Dr Khan comes into the ward and sees the wheelchair. He
approaches, his face filled with admiration.
DR KHAN
This is really quite something!
Dr Entwistle enters, and stares at them in frigid silence. He
advances towards them, turning his anger on Dr Khan, as if
Robin and Diana aren’t there.
DR ENTWISTLE
Did you give permission for this
contraption to be brought into my
ward?
Dr Khan starts to answer, but Dr Entwistle isn’t interested
in any excuses.
DR ENTWISTLE
It’s hard enough for our patients
to accept the conditions of their
lives without raising false hopes
that can only leave them more
dissatisfied. Where you come from
it may be common practice to play
games with people’s lives, but here
it is not. Is that understood?
He stalks off out of the ward.

He proposed yesterday. I’m so fond
of him. But he’s no beauty. I feel
so confused.
ROBIN
Is he actually ugly?
Well, yes.

PAMELA HARRIS

As they speak, Robin’s looking across the lawn to where Diana
stands, in conversation with Rory Stewart. From their body
language he can see that Rory’s confiding in her, and she’s
being sympathetic.
Good.

Why’s that good?

years. We have one who has been
with us for twelve years.
Clement Aitken turns and give a signal. Robin enters in his
wheelchair, pushed by Diana, accompanied by Colin Campbell.
Dr Langdorf sees him, and falls silent in shock.
Robin gazes at the patients in the silent ward.
ROBIN
(to Diana)
Push me down the ward.
Diana pushes Robin past the beds where the polio patients
lie, their respirators hissing away, keeping them alive. The
patients gaze back at him with dulled eyes. The system has
rendered them entirely passive.
DR LANGDORF
I don’t understand. The chair has a
respirator? Is it safe?
A white-coated HOSPITAL OFFICIAL comes hurrying in.
GERMAN HOSPITAL OFFICIAL
Es tut mir so leid, Herr Direktor.
Ich habe ihnen gesagt, dass sie
gehen müssen. Wenn er hier auf
unserem Gelände sterben würde…..
Dr Langdorf gives a jump of alarm.
DR LANGDORF
Sterben? Hier? Er muss gehen! Er
muss sofort raus hier!

The official hurries down the ward and steers Diana and Robin
back towards the exit. Dr Langdorf stares at Robin in his
chair as he comes back towards him.
DR LANGDORF
I’m sorry. He must leave.
CLEMENT AITKEN
Of course he must. How stupid of
me.
DR LANGDORF
Please understand we are a
department of the Bundesministerium
des Innern. If anything were to
happen...
CLEMENT AITKEN
The Ministry of the Interior? Like
our Home Office. Don’t they run the
prisons too?
DR LANGDORF
I believe so.
Dr Langdorf doesn’t hear him, staring anxiously at Robin as
Diana wheels him past him out of the ward. Clement puts out
his hand to shake.
CLEMENT AITKEN
Thank you so much, Dr Langdorf. I
do hope we’ll be seeing you at the
conference.
He leads his group out, exchanging glances with them as they
go: mission accomplished.

The hall is packed with delegates. A banner reads: MANAGING
THE LIVES OF THE SEVERELY DISABLED. Bloggs, Harry and Colin
have side seats. Dr Langdorf is near the front.
Clement Aitken is at the podium, the conference Chairman to
one side.
CLEMENT AITKEN
May I begin by noting an
interesting fact. At this
conference on managing the lives of
the severely disabled, there are no
disabled people present.
CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
Dr Aitken, forgive me. The severely
disabled are on life support
machines. How can they be present?
Clement Aitken beckons into the wings. Robin rolls onto the
stage, pushed by Diana. A gasp from the delegates.
CLEMENT AITKEN
Allow me to introduce - Mr Robin
Cavendish.
He places a microphone for Robin.
ROBIN
Good afternoon.
The chairman and the delegates gape in amazement.
CLEMENT AITKEN
Robin, tell the conference how long
you’ve been paralysed.
ROBIN
Fifteen years.
CLEMENT AITKEN
You’re kept alive by a mechanical
respirator?
Yes.

ROBIN

CLEMENT AITKEN
And you live at home?
Yes.

ROBIN

Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016

Yes... Why do you keep your
disabled people in prisons?

CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
In prisons? No, no. We maintain
some of the best facilities in the
world for the severely disabled.
ROBIN
Run by prison officers.
CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
Not at all ROBIN
Kept out of sight... No part of
healthy society...
Uproar in the hall. The delegates are appalled.
CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
I must ask you to withdraw that.
CLEMENT AITKEN
Mr Cavendish doesn’t mean to cause
offence. He merely suggests that
the severely disabled can be better
integrated into society.
ROBIN
I’m sure you care for your disabled
people... But when you look at me,
what do you see?... A creature
that’s barely alive... What do you
think?... Let’s put him in the
waiting room for death... But I, as
you see, have escaped... I have a
machine under my seat that breathes
for me... The battery lasts for
about six hours... At home I have a
respirator by my bed... I can do
nothing for myself... Yet here I
am.
Silence. He’s got to them.
ROBIN
When I was first paralysed I wanted
to die... My wife wouldn’t let
me... She told me I had to live, to
see our son grow up... So I’ve gone
on living... because of her... and
with her... and for her.
Diana, standing behind Robin, biting her lip, refusing to
cry.
ROBIN
Every day I accept the risk of
dying... because I want to live...

Breathe - Green Revision - 8 July 2016

ROBIN (CONT'D)
So go back to your prison

More time has passed. Now it’s 1980.
Robin’s face jerking, making scary sounds, blood spattering
onto the sheets. Diana up and swabbing away at the blood
spitting from the hole in his throat.
Robin subsides at last.
DIANA
I don’t know what that was, but

Robin gazes up at her, exhausted and apologetic. He looks
older and more worn. Over ten years has passed.

Clement Aitken is operating the suction tube, emptying the
fluid from Robin’s lungs. Dark blood comes oozing out into
the receiving jar.
Diana looks on.
Clement finishes and replaces the breathing tube. Robin
breathes again.
CLEMENT AITKEN
I’m afraid this is what happens
after a number of years on a
respirator. The lining of the
lungs becomes irritated. You get
small abrasions, you get
bleeding. It’s what you might
call normal wear and tear.
ROBIN
Thank you, Clem. Good to know
everything’s normal.

ROBIN (O.S.)
Buggeration!
Robin has now been equipped with a machine called POSSUM,
that enables him to perform several functions by activating a
sensor with his head. Everything’s going at once: phone
ringing, TV screen jumping channels, bed rising and falling.
The phone call is picked up.
PHONE VOICE
Hello? Doreen here.
ROBIN
Hello, Doreen. How are you, my
dear?
Jonathan enters: now a young man in his early 20s. He stands
waiting for the call to end. He looks on, smiling. Robin
hasn’t yet seen him.
PHONE VOICE
Oh, can’t complain.
ROBIN
I bet you can. Life’s never quite

You can say that again. I’d swap

Be fair. You’d miss him if he

DIANA
He’s been getting these bleeds.
And his bowels aren’t doing what

She looks up at him. She too looks so tired.
JONATHAN
I don’t know how you’ve done it,

Robin lies in bed in the darkened bedroom. His eyes are

He starts to gurgle. Spatters of blood appear round his
breathing tube.
His body spasms. Blood bursts out of his neck, staining the
sheet. He activates his alarm.
Diana comes running in, followed by Jonathan. Robin is now
gushing blood. Diana takes hold of him, and is at once
covered in blood.
DIANA
Help me turn him onto his side.
Jonathan moves in and is soon blood-soaked too.
Diana gets Robin onto his side. The blood streams out of
his neck.
Robin’s eyes meet Jonathan’s. Jonathan sees there a look of
mute horror.
DIANA
Do what you can to clean up the
mess.
She gets the suction tube and sets to work emptying the
last of the blood from inside Robin’s lungs. Jonathan mops
up round her.

A slow-moving procession through the trees: Robin in his
wheelchair, Jonathan pushing him, Diana following behind.
An echo of the earlier scene when Jonathan as a child raced
along beside the wheelchair. Times have changed. They go
slowly now.
Jonathan pushes Robin out into the open and turns him to
gaze out over the view. Diana joins them.
ON ROBIN - Looking at the view.
ROBIN
I heard a story once, in Kenya...
about a group of Mau Mau
prisoners... sixty of them...
Their leader said to his men...
‘I give you permission to die’...
The next morning all sixty were
dead.
No one speaks.
ROBIN
It’s just a matter of will...
I’ve gone on long enough.
Diana stares at him, guessing what he’s going to say.
ROBIN
August is a good month. When
August comes... I’m going to let
myself go.

She turns away and stamps off across the open grass.
Jonathan makes a move to go after her.
ROBIN
Let her go.
They watch Diana as she circles away from them, and then
heads back. She starts shouting when she’s still some
distance away.

She comes back to Robin and stands fiercely before him.

Robin lies in his bed, which has been brought out onto the
terrace, where he’s surrounded as always by young women. The
atmosphere is noisy and cheerful. Several of the guests are
other responauts in Cavendish chairs with their carers,
including Paddy with his carer, now wife, Nurse Margaret.
A queue of people are lined up to speak to Robin.

Diana and Jonathan walk past the church to the pub. They
walk in silence. A red car passes, driving fast towards
Furlongs.
CUT TO They’re sitting at one of the outdoor pub tables, waiting,
in silence. Then Mum -

JONATHAN

DIANA
No. Don’t say anything.
She looks across towards the church clock. Ten to twelve.
Nothing shows on her face, but beneath the table her hand
is holding Jonathan’s tight.
A barmaid comes up.
BARMAID
So what can I get you all today?
JONATHAN
Nothing for me, thanks. Mum?
Diana shakes her head.
BARMAID
Strictly speaking these tables
are reserved for customers only,
I know we’re not very busy right
now, but what with it coming up
to lunchtime, though a few
minutes more won’t hurt JONATHAN
It’s okay. We’re just leaving.
The red car comes past them down the road, driving away from
Furlongs. A glimpse of the driver: Clement Aitken, looking
strained.

INT. FURLONGS - DAY
MOVING POV - Into the front hall. Across to the door to
Robin’s room. Through the door into the room. Across the
room to Robin’s bed.
There he lies, eyes closed, seemingly asleep. The
respirator hisses away.
The MOVING POV approaches Robin. His eyes open.
ROBIN
Still here.
Diana and Jonathan sit down by his side.
ROBIN
I shall go to sleep very soon.
Diana strokes Robin’s head and face. An unexpected peace
settles over them.

A rumble from Robin’s chest. Some flecks of blood appear on
his neck. Diana moves to clean him up.
Leave it.

ROBIN

Another beat of silence.
ON DIANA as she strokes Robin’s face. She’s very calm,
almost as if she’s accepted he’s gone already.
DIANA
You go first, Jonathan.
Jonathan kisses Robin’s cheek.
JONATHAN
Bye, Dad. I love you.
Robin gazes long into Jonathan’s eyes.
ROBIN
My son. My boy... You’ve given me
more than you’ll ever know.
Beat.
DIANA
I don’t have a farewell speech.
You don’t mind, do you?
No.

ROBIN

DIANA
You’ve given me a wonderful life.

107-108.

ROBIN
Not quite what you were
expecting.
He’s getting drowsy now.
No.
Nor me.

DIANA
ROBIN

DIANA
I do love you, Robin.
ROBIN
And I love you, my darling... My
beautiful wife.
Another beat of silence. Their eyes on each other. Then
Robin’s eyes close. Diana leans close and kisses him.
WIDE - Diana and Jonathan sitting by Robin’s bed in
silence.
Time passes.
Jonathan takes Robin’s hand and feels gently for the pulse
on his wrist. He meets his mother’s eyes. Gives a small
nod.
Then he reaches out and switches off the respirator.
Suddenly the silence is deafening.

EXT. AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - DAY

FLYING LOW over lakes and plains. The red earth of Africa,
the dark green forests. A whole world away...
