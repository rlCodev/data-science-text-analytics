INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

PHILOMENA sits at a pew in a largely empty church - there are
two other WORSHIPPERS dotted about; there is no service. She
is looking at a statue of Madonna and Child.

*
*
*

A PRIEST passes PHILOMENA and stops to talk. He is dressed in
a black sweater and dog collar rather than formal robes.

*
*

PRIEST
Hello Philomena, haven’t seen you
for a while?

*
*
*

PHILOMENA
I just came in to light a candle.

*
*

PRIEST
Someone special?

*
*

PHILOMENA

*
*

Yes.
But she pointedly doesn’t elaborate any further. The PRIEST
tries to continue the conversation:

*
*

PRIEST
How’s the new hip?

*
*

PHILOMENA
It’s very good. It’s Ti-tanium.

*
*

PRIEST
Oh, the bionic woman...

*
*

She smiles, but he can see she’s not really in the mood for
talking.

*
*

PRIEST (CONT’D)
Well, always nice to see you.

*

He carries on. PHILOMENA returns her gaze to the Madonna and
Child.

ROBERT looks up from a folder of results he’s reading and,
familiar with Martin’s hypochondria, ignores the question.
ROBERT
Weight fine... could do with losing
a centimetre or two off your waist.
Stool sample outstanding...
MARTIN finally perks up at this, raises his eyebrow, pleased
with himself. ROBERT notices this...

No, that means you haven’t provided

MARTIN
Oh right, yes. No, I’d remember.
ROBERT

Nineteen year old PHILOMENA LEE, pretty, dark haired, wears a
lovely summer dress, that same crucifix glinting in the
sunshine. She picks her way wide-eyed, through the crowd;
bright lights, the air filled with noise and excitement.
JOHN (OOV)
You looking for something?

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 6.

YOUNG PHILOMENA turns to see JOHN, early 20s, with a group of
his FRIENDS by a beer tent, smiling at her.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
No.
She walks off, he follows.
JOHN
I haven’t seen yous any place.
Where are you from?
JOHN follows her past the brightly coloured stalls, still
cradling his glass of beer.
JOHN (cont’d)
Are you from Limerick then?
YOUNG PHILOMENA stops by a hoop-la, excited by the attention
but trying to play it - at least a little - cool.
JOHN (cont’d)
Here have a drink of my beer.
He holds out his beer. She shakes her head.
JOHN (cont’d)
Go on take it - what’s the matter
with you.
She relents, takes the glass from him and takes a swig. She
doesn’t like the taste.
JOHN (cont’d)
I like your dress. Did you make it
yourself?
YOUNG PHILOMENA
(Indignant)
No I bought it in a shop. Anyway,
me auntie told me I’m not to talk
to strange men like you.
JOHN
Sure I’m not strange. Look at yer
man over there...
He nods to a ruddy-faced man, early 20s, (DECLAN), his ankleswinger trousers tied up with string, buying a toffee apple
from a stall and looking at his purchase with reverence.
JOHN (cont’d)
Has a rope for a belt. He should
put some jam on his shoes and
invite his trousers down for tea.
YOUNG PHILOMENA giggles.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 7.

JOHN (cont’d)
That’s who your auntie was talking
about.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
I wouldn’t mind a bite of his
toffee apple.
JOHN
You want a toffee apple?
(Calls out)
Declan!
DECLAN looks over, smiles, revealing one and a half teeth.
JOHN (cont’d)
Come over here.
DECLAN, a simple soul, dutifully troops over.
JOHN (cont’d)
Do you want this beer?
There’s about half a pint left. DECLAN nods enthusiastically.
JOHN nods to the toffee apple, a single bite out of it.
JOHN (cont’d)
I’ll swap you.

CLOSE on PHILOMENA LEE, an elderly Irish lady, watching TV,
the blue light playing on the lenses of her glasses. Though
distracted, distant with her thoughts, she is half paying
attention to a news report on TV about the purchase, for
forty nine and a half million pounds, of a painting of by
Rubens - ‘The Slaughter of The Innocents’.
Her daughter JANE, dark-haired, late 30s, enters in a hurry.
She pulls a coat over an outfit of black skirt and white top (like a receptionist in Soho House might wear).
JANE
Right, just go up and turn their
lights out in half an hour.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 8.

PHILOMENA
Doesn’t she know you’ve got a
proper job?
JANE
I’m just helping her out tonight she’s short staffed.
The painting flashes up on TV, depicting bloody biblical
carnage.
PHILOMENA
(Distracted, talking to
the TV not JANE)
Fancy spending all that money on a
God awful thing like that? If it
was me I’d take everyone to the
Brent Cross shopping centre and I’d
say you can have one thing,
whatever you like - two things.
JANE drops her keys in her bag, she’s ready to go:
JANE
So I’ll be back before midnight.
Okay?
PHILOMENA doesn’t respond.
JANE (cont’d)
Mum?
JANE sees her mother is looking down at something in her
hands.
PHILOMENA
And I’d get myself a brand new
Nissan Micro automatic...
JANE
Mother?
She sees PHILOMENA is clutching a small, old, black and white
photo with serrated edges. She is late for work but begins to
sense something is badly wrong.
JANE (cont’d)
What is it mum? What’s the matter?
PHILOMENA looks up at JANE, tears in her eyes. JANE nods to
the photo.
JANE (cont’d)
What’s that?
PHILOMENA’S hands start to shake as, slowly, she holds it up.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM, ROSCREA - NIGHT

YOUNG PHILOMENA, her sweaty face contorted as she screams out
in agony. She lays back on a bed, legs in stirrups, in an
improvised delivery room above the chapel. She’s in the
advanced stages of labour - but there are complications.
As two OLDER NUNS look on impotently, wringing their hands,
she is attended by a younger nun just a few years older than
her. This is Sister ANUNCIATA, pale, red-haired, terrified.
She looks at a pair of forceps in a metal bowl and knows she
should attempt to use them - but they seem monstrous,
medieval. YOUNG PHILOMENA grabs ANUNCIATA’S hand as another
spasm grips her body.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
Don’t let them put him in the
ground. It’s cold there... it’s
dark there...
ANUNCIATA extricates her hand and hurries away from the bed,
leaving YOUNG PHILOMENA frightened, distraught...

Other inmates of Roscrea, ‘fallen’ YOUNG GIRLS like
Philomena, a couple of them obviously pregnant, kneel by
their beds in prayer. They are watched over by MOTHER
BARBARA, mid-50s, kind-faced, the most senior nun at Roscrea.
From upstairs they can hear PHILOMENA crying out in pain; we
see how frightened the YOUNG GIRLS are, some in tears.
MOTHER BARBARA
(Soothing voice)
Pray girls. Pray for the Magdalen.
As they whisper their prayers ANUNCIATA enters the dormitory
and hurries up to MOTHER BARBARA.
ANUNCIATA
Reverend Mother, please - we must
get a doctor. The baby is the wrong
way round, it’s breech.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 10.

MOTHER BARBARA is aware the YOUNG GIRLS are listening
intently. In that same, soothing voice, she replies:
MOTHER BARBARA
It’s in God’s hands now.
Now we see the hardness in her, the darkness of her eyes.
MOTHER BARBARA (cont’d)
The pain is her penance. It will
help absolve her of her sin.

YOUNG PHILOMENA thrashes about, delirious. The OLDER NUNS can
do no more than press wet cloths to her head.
ANUNCIATA enters, looks at YOUNG PHILOMENA in such pain. She
sees again the forceps on the side and cries out in anguish:
ANUNCIATA
I don’t know how to do it!
Mother Barbara’s words are in her head... ‘it’s in God’s
hands now’... but she cannot do it - she cannot just stand by
and let the girl die. She picks up the forceps and plunges
between YOUNG PHILOMENA’S legs. On the girl’s scream...

INT. MOTHER BARBARA’S STUDY, ROSCREA - DAY
Jump back to two months earlier. YOUNG PHILOMENA stands
before MOTHER BARBARA and YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE, Mother
Barbara’s number two, thin-faced, early 40s. Ashamed of her
swollen, pregnant belly, she can barely meet their eyes.
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
Did you let him put his hands on
you?
YOUNG PHILOMENA
(Beat, humiliated)
Yes sister.
MOTHER BARBARA
And did you enjoy that? Did you
enjoy your sin?
YOUNG PHILOMENA doesn’t answer.
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
Did you take your knickers down?
YOUNG PHILOMENA looks at the two older women, their eyes
boring into her. She is too petrified to answer.

MOTHER BARBARA
Answer Sister Hildegarde - did you
take them down?
YOUNG PHILOMENA
(Tears in her eyes)
Yes.
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE settles back into her chair, turns
sniffily to Mother BARBARA:
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
He got an awful lot for his toffee
apple.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
Oh Reverend Mother the sisters at
school never told us anything about
babies or... the thing.
MOTHER BARBARA
Did your mother not tell you?
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
Her mother died ten years ago.
MOTHER BARBARA
Oh, God rest her soul...

But don’t dare to blame the
sisters! You are the cause of this
shame. You and your indecency!

Back to the birth. With the forceps and her strong fingers,
ANUNCIATA pushes and twists the tiny body inside YOUNG
PHILOMENA, lying back, drenched in sweat, moaning in pain.
Finally, with a gush of pale red liquid onto the white sheet,
ANUNCIATA pulls out the baby’s head, dragging a new life into
God’s world. It’s over and ANUNCIATA, overcome with emotion,
holds up the newborn baby to his mother.
ANUNCIATA
It’s a boy.
She hands him to YOUNG PHILOMENA, who takes him to her chest.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
I knew.
Caption: Roscrea, 1952
The door to the delivery room opens. MOTHER BARBARA stands in
the doorway, taking in the sight of YOUNG PHILOMENA cradling
her baby. She makes the sign of the cross.

Aware of MOTHER BARBARA’S icy glare but bitter at her
hypocrisy, ANUNCIATA is forced to also make the sign.

INT. MARION’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A drinks party at a central London town house, an informal
gathering for journalists and New Labour types. WAITRESSES
serving drinks to GUESTS.
JANE, worried, is serving canapes (or maybe she is going
round with bottles of wine topping up glasses). And now we
REVEAL behind her MARTIN, looking ill at ease, wishing he
wasn’t there. DAVID, an old friend, same age, chatting with
KEITH, 50s, and a woman, 40s, a no-nonsense look about her
(SALLY MITCHELL).
DAVID
Martin!
MARTIN forces a smile and joins them.
DAVID (cont’d)
(Gestures to KEITH)
Keith you know.
(Then to SALLY)
Sally Mitchell this is Martin
Sixsmith, used to be the BBC’s man
in Moscow.
MARTIN
And Washington.
DAVID
And then became a spin doctor for
the government, until it all went a
bit tits up. Is that a fair
summation Martin?
DAVID is not drunk but has obviously had a few drinks.
JANE, serving, is all ears.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 13.

MARTIN
Yes. Pretty much. I suppose if you
shovel shit for long enough, you’ll
end up with some on your shoes.
They laugh politely.
DAVID
Yeh but you got it on your head how did you manage that?
They laugh louder - MARTIN too.
MARTIN
Yes, well, you’ve got to have a
sense of humour about these things.
DAVID
What are you up to at the moment?
MARTIN
I’m thinking of writing a book. On
Russian history..?
They look at him and no-one responds. Horrible eggy moment.
MARTIN (cont’d)
Or something else. Might try going
back to journalismSALLY
I remember you! You’re the one who
sent that terrible e-mail sayingMARTIN
No I didn’t. Common mistake.
SALLY
(Line overlaps with his)
-it was a good day to bury bad news
on 9/11... I thought that was you?
MARTIN
No, that was someone else. What I
actually did was, one year later,
on the day of Princess Margaret’s
funeral, send an e-mail saying
let’s make sure the only thing we
‘bury’ today - inverted commas - is
Princess Margaret.
DAVID
Which is slightly different.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 14.

MARTIN
It’s totally different. But the
papers said it was another e-mail
about burying bad news, nobody from
the government defended me and... I
got royally fucked up the arse by a
bunch of self interested spineless
shits.
SALLY
(Sarcastic)
But you’ve still got a sense of
humour about it?
MARTIN
(Defiantly)
Yes.
DAVID
Well if you want to get back into
journalism, talk to Sally.
SALLY
Oh I just do, you know, sob
stories, human interest stuff - not
really your cup of tea is it.
MARTIN looks at her awkwardly. It isn’t, but he doesn’t want
to say it isn’t.
SALLY (cont’d)
But I’ll be happy to have a look if
you want to push any ideas my way?
MARTIN
Yes... please.
To escape his embarrassment he walks over to JANE, standing
close by.
MARTIN (cont’d)
Could I get a glass of... Pinot
Grigio please?
JANE is obviously not in the mood for niceties:
JANE
It’s just red or white.
MARTIN
Oh yes, sorry. White then please.
But as she pours it, there is the first glimmer of
recognition. She’s sure she’s seen Martin before.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 15.

JANE
I hope you don’t mind me asking but
didn’t you used to be a reporter on
News At Ten?
MARTIN
Erm, I was the BBC’S correspondent
yes, in Moscow and then Washington.
JANE
I know a woman, you see, and she
had a baby when she was a teenager
and she kept it a secret for fifty
years - we only found out about it
today. And the baby was taken from
her by these nuns and they made her
have it adopted. And she kept it a
secret all this time...
(Beat)
It’s my mother.
MARTIN
Yes I guessed.
JANE
Would that be of any interest you
to you - that kind of thing?
MARTIN
Well, I’m actually quite busy
writing a book at the moment.
JANE
What about?
MARTIN
Russian history...
(On her glazed reaction)
-which is actually fascinating. And
what you’re talking about is a
human interest story, which I don’t
really do.
JANE
Why not?
He sees, at the other end of the kitchen, SALLY MITCHELL,
DAVID and KEITH laughing with some other GUESTS.
MARTIN
Because human interest tends to be
a euphemism for stories about
vulnerable, weak-minded, ignorant,
people to fill up the pages of
newspapers read by vulnerable, weakminded, ignorant people.
(Suddenly realising how
this sounds)

CLOSE UP on an overweight mobile phone SALESMAN picking
through some ribs. Amongst other lunch time customers, all of
whom are very probably not interested in Russian history, we
FIND MARTIN standing waiting in the reception area, watching
with faint disgust as the phone SALESMAN licks his fingers.
MARTIN looks out of the entrance doors, his face reflected in
the glass. He looks at his watch, ponders on why he’s here
and not at all sure it’s a good idea. He glances out of the
doors again... and he sees her. PHILOMENA, walking across the
car park towards him, JANE by her side. His ghostly
reflection in the glass is super-imposed over her for a
moment...
Curiosity aroused, he strains to get a good look - but gets
only intermittent glimpses as a couple cars drive past on
their way out of the car park. He notes she’s dressed smartly
- presumably for his benefit - and looks nervous. As she
finally enters the restaurant he smiles and steps forward to
greet her:
MARTIN
Hello I’m Martin, you must be
Philomena.
PHILOMENA
Hello Martin.
They shake hands; he notes the crucifix around her neck, she
in turn sneaks a look at him as he greets JANE.
MARTIN
(To JANE)
Hello again.
He gestures into the restaurant.
MARTIN (cont’d)
Table’s through here...
He starts to lead them towards their table.
MARTIN (cont’d)

Sorry if I was a little rude the
other night, caught me at a bad
moment...

I’m just glad you managed to track
me down. Hope you didn’t mind
meeting here but it’s mum’s
favourite.
MARTIN
Oh no it’s... nice.
They all sit down.
MARTIN (cont’d)
So how are you Philomena?
PHILOMENA
I’m all right. I had a new hip last
year Martin, it’s much better than
the bone one I had before and it’s
made of ti-tanium which is metal but it doesn’t rust.
MARTIN
Well if that happened you’d have to
have it oiled like the Tin Man
wouldn’t you.
PHILOMENA
Oh is that right?
MARTIN
No no - I mean, like the Wizard of
Oz.
PHILOMENA turns to JANE.
PHILOMENA
What does he mean?
JANE
He’s just joking mum.
MARTIN
It was just a joke. No, actually my
mother has advanced osteoarthritis
in both her knees.

now joking - and tries to move the whole thing on.

Yes. I am. I have a wife, Kate.

A long line of babies in cots. Two NUNS tend over them.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
I disappeared from the world. My
family didn’t visit me, and out of
shame my father told everyone that
I was dead. After you’d had your
baby you had to stay in the Abbey
for four years, totally cut off
from the outside world. In order to
repay the sisters for taking you
in, you had to work.

The Abbey laundry; swirling steam, clattering noise. Watched
over by YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE and two other NUNS, ‘fallen’
GIRLS work loading clothing and bedding into boiling tubs of
water; or put wet laundry through huge mangles then hang it
out to dry on overhead lines.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
The worst jobs were in the laundry,
and that’s where they put me. I
worked there seven days a week, the
whole time I was there. They took
in washing from miles around and
charged for the service. We weren’t
paid a penny. I worked there with
my best friend Kathleen.

We find YOUNG PHILOMENA amongst them, dressed in a shapeless
pinafore, working over a boiling tub. Next to her is
KATHLEEN, a pale faced young woman of roughly the same age.
It’s arduous, physically demanding work and YOUNG PHILOMENA
and KATHLEEN, though worn out, try to keep each other’s

aged between two and three, rush past us into their mother’s

A little later. YOUNG PHILOMENA is sitting with KATHLEEN.
They watch ANTHONY flying a toy aeroplane and holding the
hand of Kathleen’s little daughter MARY, aged two, as they
walk about together. The little girl reaches to take
Anthony’s aeroplane and he lets her, without protest. She
flies it about, just like he did.

*

PHILOMENA (V.O.)
Anthony was best friends with
Kathleen’s daughter Mary - he’d
even let her fly his little toy
aeroplane. True love! The two of
them were inseparable.
The MOTHERS and CHILDREN are watched over by ANUNCIATA and
another NUN, sitting together. YOUNG PHILOMENA and ANUNCIATA
exchange a secret smile - but she can’t talk to her whilst
the other NUN is there, it’s not allowed.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
(to KATHLEEN)
Look at that, he won’t let her out
of his sight.
KATHLEEN doesn’t answer; YOUNG PHILOMENA sees she is anxious,
worried.

YOUNG PHILOMENA
What’s the matter?
KATHLEEN
(In a sudden rush)
Oh Phil the girls in the kitchen
said Mother Barbara had Mary up at
the house today - what do you think
she wanted with her?
YOUNG PHILOMENA’S turns this over in her mind, but presents a
comforting face to her KATHLEEN.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
I’m sure it’s nothing to worry
about Kath.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
We lived with it every day. Who’s
child would be taken next?
YOUNG PHILOMENA sees the other NUN leave the room, and seizes
the opportunity to go and talk to ANUNCIATA.
YOUNG PHILOMENA
(To KATHLEEN)
I won’t be a minute.
She goes over to ANUNCIATA , sits down next to her and talks
in a quiet voice:

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

YOUNG PHILOMENA
Kathleen’s worried sick. She thinks
they’re going to take Mary away
from her. I said if they were going
to do that they’d tell her first
for sure...
ANUNCIATA is caught between a rock and a hard place. She’s
just a young girl herself, and she doesn’t know how to deal
with the enormity of what she knows will happen to most of
the girls at the abbey. So she clumsily tries to move the
conversation on, and pulls something from her robe.
ANUNCIATA
(Keeping her voice down)
I got something for you Phil, but
you can’t tell anyone about it.

*
*

She hands YOUNG PHILOMENA a small, black and white
photograph. She gasps: it is of Anthony, clutching his
aeroplane, looking shyly at the camera.
ANUNCIATA
He’s growing up so fast.

YOUNG PHILOMENA
Oh thank you...

passes it to MARTIN, who studies it.
PHILOMENA
Whenever I look at that, I think
about Anthony but I say a little
prayer for Anunciata, who saved his
life when I gave birth to him. She
died a long time ago... if she
hadn’t taken that, I’d have
nothing.
MARTIN
So... you were just trapped there

YOUNG PHILOMENA is back at work in the laundry.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
It happened about a week later. I
remember that day so clearly.
As she starts to heave a heavy laundry bag over to a tub she
hears, outside, SFX tyres crunching on gravel. At this sound
the GIRLS exchange looks, a feeling of dread settling over
them. KATHLEEN starts to shake with fear.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 24.

PHILOMENA (V.O.)
We all knew what it meant when a
big car arrived. Kathleen was
inconsolable. She knew this time
they’d come for Mary.

*

YOUNG PHILOMENA looks around and sees that, temporarily,
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE and one of the other nuns have
disappeared - there is only one NUN left, who has her back to
her. YOUNG PHILOMENA abandons her duties and crosses to a
small basement window high up in the wall. Standing on
tiptoes, she sees, beyond a hedge, a dreaded shiny black
limousine drive past. KATHLEEN looks up at her piteously,
pleadingly. YOUNG PHILOMENA catches the eye of another GIRL,
who shakes her head - ‘Don’t do it...’ - but ignores her and,
checking that the NUN is still distracted, quickly darts
through a back door.

YOUNG PHILOMENA emerges alone into a small courtyard, crosses
to the far side and peers through some gates fencing her off
from the outside world. Foliage half obscures some wellheeled FIGURES getting out of the limousine - a thirtysomething woman in a fur coat and a man in a Cashmere coat
and Homburg hat.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
As soon as I saw their lovely
clothes, and Mother Barbara so
happy and smiling, I knew all hope
was gone.
She watches as they are greeted at the main entrance by a
fawning and uncharacteristically gregarious Mother BARBARA.
Then, from behind:
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE (V.O.)
Come away from there!
She turns, scalded, and there is YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE.
YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
What are you doing out here?
YOUNG PHILOMENA
I... I had a stomach ache, Sister
Hidegarde. It’s my time of the

Later that afternoon. YOUNG PHILOMENA is buttoning up her
pinafore as she stands at a window.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
Kathleen cried so hard they took
her to the sick bay and gave her
brandy. But her fate was sealed.

*

YOUNG PHILOMENA looks down through the window and we...
CUT TO:
... her POV. From her vantage point she looks down across a
courtyard, through a window, into the nursery. She can see
little MARY but, because of the angle she is looking down
from and the height of the window frame, she can only see the
bottom halves of four adults who surround the little girl.
Mother BARBARA and YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE - identifiable
from their unflattering skirts and shoes - are presenting
MARY to the couple we saw earlier, the woman recognizable
from her fur coat and heels; the man from his pressed
trousers and polished shoes. MARY looks up at them wide-eyed,
frightened.
FRIEND (OOV)
Phil, it’s choir practice.
YOUNG PHILOMENA lingers on the scene below for a few more
moments, horribly fascinated.
FRIEND (OOV)
You’ll be in trouble if you don’t
go...
Reluctantly, YOUNG PHILOMENA turns and follows the FRIEND
out. But we STAY on the view and see what she misses: ANTHONY
runs into shot, holds MARY’S hand and looks up at the adults.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
They’d only come for Mary. But
Anthony wouldn’t let her out of his
sight. They were inseparable, you
see...

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 26.

The WOMAN crouches down to ANTHONY’S level and touches his
face tenderly. But, because she has her back to us, we still
don’t see her face. We don’t need to, she simply represents
money. A customer. The WOMAN takes the hands of both children
and leads them away. Over this we hear, incoming from the
next scene, the CHOIR SINGING...

YOUNG PHILOMENA sings in the chapel. She is with other
MAGDALEN GIRLS on one row of pews; the NUNS, strictly
segregated on another row, facing them.
PHILOMENA (V.O.)
Normally, I loved to sing - it was
one of the only things I enjoyed at
that place. But all I could think
about was poor Kathleen.
We can see YOUNG PHILOMENA’S heart isn’t in it, her
expression far off, her mind elsewhere. She sees ANUNCIATA
enter the chapel and take her place with the NUNS. She
catches her friend’s eye and manages to throw her a smile.
But ANUNCIATA, hollow-eyed, is unable to return it. YOUNG
PHILOMENA sees tears in her friend’s eyes - she’s crying?
Assuming she must also be upset about Kathleen, YOUNG
PHILOMENA carries on as the hymn builds to a crescendo.
But now a MAGDALEN GIRL enters the chapel and hurries to join
the others. She pushes through until she’s next to YOUNG
PHILOMENA, then urgently whispers in her ear. The blood
drains from YOUNG PHILOMENA’S face; panic-stricken she pushes
her way to the end of the pew. ANUNCIATA watches her go,
agonized expression.

-it was before my time. So I’m
afraid we’re at a standstill.
PHILOMENA
Oh...
SISTER CLAIRE
I have no news. I’m so sorry we
can’t help you.
We can see how much of a blow this is to PHILOMENA, how much
she’d built herself up.
PHILOMENA
Yes. Yes...
The room falls silent. MARTIN watches as PHILOMENA starts to
speak, quietly at first but building in emotion.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
I still go to mass... I don’t want
to cause any fuss or point the
finger at anyone, or blame the
church in any way. I just want to
know that he’s all right - I don’t
even have to see him. Sometimes I
have visions of him and he’s
homeless and nobody loves him...
SISTER CLAIRE
(Takes PHILOMENA’S hand)
Philomena we can’t take away your
pain, but we can walk through it
with you, hand in hand.
MARTIN
What about some of the older nuns?
Perhaps they might remember a few
details?

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 38.

SISTER CLAIRE
Most of them have passed on.
MARTIN
What about the ones that haven’t?
SISTER CLAIRE
Well I don’t think you’ll get much
sense out of them.
MARTIN
Can I try?
He sneaks another look and sees a curtain being drawn by
someone in front of HILDEGARDE, so he can no longer see
inside the room.
SISTER CLAIRE
I don’t think that’s going to be
possible.
MARTIN
Why not?
SISTER CLAIRE
I’m happy to answer any questions
that Philomena has.
MARTIN
I’m asking a question.
SISTER CLAIRE
You’re a journalist.
MARTIN
I used to be, certainly.
PHILOMENA
Martin’s a Roman Catholic.
MARTIN
Yes... well, I used to be.
SISTER CLAIRE
I’d feel more comfortable if I
could speak to Philomena in
private.
MARTIN has rather enjoyed - for this brief moment - being a
journalist again. But, on catching PHILOMENA’S worried
expression - she hates confrontation - he reins it back in. A
beat then, politely:
MARTIN
Of course.

INT. GIFT SHOP AREA - DAY

MARTIN shuts the door behind him, quietly seething at Sister
Claire’s obfuscating. He wanders over to the gift shop stand
and idly fingers a little plastic Jesus for a few moments but his mind is elsewhere. Checking he’s not being observed,
he crosses to some double doors and peers through them and
sees the Old Nun (HILDEGARDE), on her sticks, silhouetted
against the light from the open door behind her. Her eyes
seem to meet his; her expression inscrutable. MARTIN smiles.
He reaches to open the door. Then, from the staircase behind
him:
YOUNG NUN (OOV)
Hello - can I help you?
MARTIN spins round to see the YOUNG NUN.
MARTIN
Sorry, I was just erm...
YOUNG NUN
Are you looking for something?
He turns back, just as the door shuts; Sister HILDEGARDE is
gone, the light from the room extinguished. The momentary
opening closed.
MARTIN

Those are private quarters.
MARTIN
Right.

Margaret...), that nuns from the Abbey are buried here.
Curious, he walks along until he finds Mother Barbara’s
grave, and notes she died on July 20th, 1990.

The bit between his teeth, MARTIN climbs over a low fence
into a small enclosed area adjacent to the nuns’ graveyard
which is thoroughly overgrown with weeds, bushes and
brambles. He crouches down, peers through the tangle and can
just make out a headstone. Using his feet and hands he clears
away the overgrowth around it until he can see it properly
and reads the inscription: ‘Maria Gidney’, a young woman who
died in 1962 aged 16, with underneath: ‘Mother And Child Died
In Childbirth’...
JUMP CUT TO:
He uses a stick to clear away bracken from another headstone,
he reads: ‘Aisling Devlin’, who died in 1957 aged only 14.
And again, underneath: ‘Mother And Child Died In Childbirth’.
He stands up, surveys the overgrown graveyard and the nuns’
graveyard next to it, and the thought hits him: ‘Why are the
graves of the nuns beautifully tended, and yet the graves of
the mothers and children abandoned and overgrown?’

She said you were a journalist and
you were trying to manipulate me

to you.
She opens her bag, takes out the manila envelope, hands it to
MARTIN.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
And she gave me this.
MARTIN
Do you want me to open it?
Again she doesn’t reply. He opens it, takes out a single
sheet of paper - obviously a photocopy. He scans it.
MARTIN (cont’d)
It’s a contract... signed by you,
in 1955.

countryside and green fields lead to some high hills.
MARTIN
Funny isn’t it, how every piece of
paper that might be able to help
you has been destroyed. But guess
what? The one piece of paper
designed to stop you from finding
him has been lovingly preserved.
God in His infinite wisdom decided
to spare that from the flames.
PHILOMENA
I signed it because I believed I’d
committed a terrible sin Martin,
and I had to be punished. And...
what made it so much worse, was
that I enjoyed it.
MARTIN
What?
PHILOMENA
The sex.
He turns to face her.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Oh, it was wonderful. I thought I
was floating on air. He was so
handsome and the way he held me in
his arms and - well I didn’t even
know I had a clitoris Martin.
MARTIN
Really?

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 43.

PHILOMENA
And after I had the sex, I thought
anything that feels so lovely must
be wrong.
MARTIN
(Mutters)
Fucking Catholics.
(Realizes what he’s said)
Sorry.
She smiles.
PHILOMENA
I spent thirty years as a nurse,
I’ve heard worse than that.
MARTIN
It’s just that, why would God
bestow on us a sexual desire which
he then wants us to resist? Is it
some weird game that he’s invented
to alleviate the boredom of being
omnipotent? Baffles me... and I
thought I was pretty clever.
They fall quiet; she stares out at the view.
PHILOMENA
Well maybe you’re not.
He looks at her; smiles to himself at how sharply she gave as
good as she got.

in front of her, he a pint of Guinness - both almost
finished.
JANE
How did it go?
MARTIN
What, from the Sisters of Little
Mercy?
JANE
(Laughs)
Just tea and cake then. That’s all
they’ve ever given mum.

Well he’s poured it now.
JANE rolls her eyes; PHILOMENA knocks it back in two gulps.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Night Martin.
MARTIN
Good night Philomena. Night Jane.
They exchange a smile, then they leave. MARTIN reflects on
things for a few moments. The BARMAN, early 40s, puts another
pint of Guinness down in front of him, MARTIN runs a finger
down the side of it.
BARMAN
Been up to the Abbey?
MARTIN
Yes. Yes, it’s obviously changed a
lot. Different nuns there now, not
the same ones they had when the
Magdalen girls were there.
From out the back:
MUM (OOV)
They’re all gone now!
MARTIN flicks a look in the direction the voice came from,
but the BARMAN ignores it.
BARMAN
We’ve had a few staying here,
trying to find what happened to
their sons or daughters.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 45.
BARMAN (cont'd)
There’s not many of them gets any
joy from there.

MARTIN
I imagine that’s because of the
fire? The one that destroyed
everything?
BARMAN
I’m sure it is.
MARTIN
How did that start - do you know?
BARMAN
I should think they put a match to
it.
MARTIN
Who?
BARMAN
The Sisters. Sure they had a great
fire out the back in the field.
MARTIN
So... the building wasn’t damaged?
BARMAN
They had a fuckin’ big bonfire,
burnt all the records. Thousands of
‘em.
MARTIN
Why?
BARMAN
This was years ago. I suppose they
were embarrassed about selling all
them babies to America.
From out the back again:
MUM (OOV)
They don’t want people telling
tales.
BARMAN
That’s me mother.
MARTIN
You say they were sold to
Americans?

Ireland to look for babies.

MUM (cont’d)
Jane Russell bought a baby. From
Derry, in 1952.
MARTIN
That’s unbelievable... babies were
sold?
MUM
They said she came in here and
asked for Bourbon but they had to
give her a glass of Paddy instead.
But I’m not one to repeat gossip.
MARTIN
No, no... I can see that.
As she says this MARTIN finds his eye resting on a ‘Madonna
and Child’ above the optics.
MARTIN (cont’d)
So how did they decide who got a
baby?
MUM
If you were a Catholic with a
thousand pounds you could buy a
baby. Jane Russell bought one to
take home with her. But my lips are

SALLY looks around for a stirrer, can’t find one so uses her

MICHAEL (AS PUCK)
Through the forest have I gone.
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring
love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping

On the dank and dirty ground.

there in the middle of everyone is MICHAEL, now mid-30s,
smiling, enigmatic. He speaks to the guy behind the camera:
MICHAEL

long list of files; we see pictures of different males of
varying ages, all named ‘Anthony’ or ‘Tony’ Lee. Some
Christian names are spelt with a ‘h’, some without; some
surnames spelt ‘Leigh’ or ‘Lea’. Each file is different, some
have a military appearance, some civil, some even appear to
be criminal records.

shaking hands with somebody; another is a young black boy,
another is a man in a marines uniform. MARTIN dwells on some,
but quickly rejects others. He dials a number on his mobile;

inbox from ‘Owsianoska, Caroline’, entitled ‘Anthony Lee’. He
opens it and clicks on a link. As he waits for it to download
he sees PHILOMENA back at the omelette station, and catches a
snippet of her renewed conversation with the CHEF.
PHILOMENA
-were you born in Mexico? Well you
must like nachos? My grand daughter
Natalie got me into them. I’ve
never been to Mexico - I hear it’s
lovely apart from the kidnappingsShaking his head in exasperation, he turns back to the screen
where an image downloads line by line from the top of the
screen. We make out a blurry newspaper photo of a little boy
and girl, holding hands with a smart, middle-aged couple
posing at an airport arrivals lounge. MARTIN hears PHILOMENA
share a laugh with the CHEF and is about to look over to them
when the image reveals the boy is holding a tin toy aeroplane
in his hand. Stunned, he recognizes it instantly. He has
found Anthony. The headline above the cutting reads: ‘New
Life For Irish Orphans’.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 71.

Excited, he scans the article, picks up the surname Hess then
finds the boy’s Christian name: Michael.
He puts ‘Michael Hess, D.O.B. 07.05.52’ into a search engine,
waits a few moments, then clicks on a site - the official
site of the Republican Party. There is a picture of the adult
Michael, early 30s, smiling, in a formal head and shoulders
pose. But it’s the passage at the top of the page which jolts
him: Michael A. Hess: (b) 07.05.52 - (d) 08.15.95. He stares
at the legend (d). Surely not..?
Scarcely able to believe it, he scans the article below the
picture, picks out some key sentences: ‘Michael was brought
to the US from Ireland by his adoptive parents...’ and then,
at the end: ‘... Michael died on August 15th, 1995.’
See MARTIN: Oh God, he’s dead...
MARTIN looks up to see PHILOMENA making her way back to the
table with her omelette and a bowl of raspberries. In a panic
he quickly shuts down the window showing the young Anthony
clutching the aeroplane.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
They’ve run out of blueberries so I
got you raspberries instead.
MARTIN just stares at her, frozen expression. She
misinterprets this as an admonishment.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Oh, I’m sorry. Quiet time.
As PHILOMENA puts down her tray she glances at the screen,
now just displaying the image of the adult Michael in the
formal pose. She stares at it and, even though she can’t know
what Anthony would look like as a grown man, puts her hand to
her chest.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
That’s my Anthony.
She looks at MARTIN, who doesn’t answer. But his eyes not
only confirm this they tell her something else... she
clutches her crucifix.

overcome it by talking to people

They are back in Philomena’s old room. MARTIN is at a desk
tapping away at his laptop, PHILOMENA is sitting on a sofa
watching ‘Big Momma’s House’. MARTIN, uncomfortable with the
heavy emotion of the situation, looks across to her, sees she
has a glazed expression:
MARTIN
Are you okay?
PHILOMENA
I thought it would make me laugh.
MARTIN tries to make some sense of what she’s watching.
MARTIN
Is that a man?
PHILOMENA
I don’t know.
MARTIN
I’ve been sent a picture of Anthony
- do you want to see it?
PHILOMENA
Oh...
(She thinks about this)
Yes please.
He offers her his chair; she gets up and walks over, sitting
down in front of his laptop. She puts her glasses on and
stares at the photo: it’s a wide, group shot with about
twenty people in it, including Anthony and Marcia, at a
formal function.
MARTIN
It’s from a woman we’re meeting
tomorrow called Marcia Weller, she
was a colleague of Anthony’s... now
shall we have a drink?
He bends down by the mini-bar.
PHILOMENA
He looks very smart.
MARTIN
He worked in the legal department
for the American government. Brandy
isn’t it...

PHILOMENA

MARTIN
(Getting up)
Never mind, I’ll get you one from
my room.
He walks towards the door.

PHILOMENA
Martin... This man looks just like
you.
He stops by the door. She points to a figure in the back row
of the photo. MARTIN walks back over to the desk and looks
more closely. Puzzled, he enlarges the picture slightly,
looks intently at the figure.
MARTIN
(Long beat)
It is me.
Sure enough, it’s him, in profile, talking to someone;
Michael is standing just a few feet away from him. Mind
spinning as he studies the photo, fragments of memory come
back to MARTIN. That name - he knew he’d heard it before...
MARTIN (cont’d)
Michael Hess... I met him.
PHILOMENA
Where?
MARTIN
At the White House.
PHILOMENA
Oh dear God...
MARTIN
It was when I was with the BBC.
(Searching his memory)
Would have been about... ten years
ago.
PHILOMENA
(Hungrily)
What was he like?

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 79.

Now we see the first chink in Martin’s armour of detachment he is personally involved. He knows how desperate PHILOMENA
is for information, and he wants to help - but he can’t. He
stares again at the grainy, blown up image of him standing
just a few feet away from Michael.
MARTIN
Erm... I can’t remember too much...
(Grasping at straws)
It was a Republican thing...
(Racking his brain)
I don’t really remember.
PHILOMENA
You must remember something.
MARTIN
(Suddenly something comes
to him)
I shook hands with him, he was by
the door as we entered.
PHILOMENA
What was his handshake like?
MARTIN looks at her, not even remembering this but desperate
to come up with something for her.
MARTIN
Well, if it had been a weak
handshake I’d have remembered it.
No-one would get to that position
with a weak handshake.
PHILOMENA
So he had a strong handshake?
MARTIN
Yes.
PHILOMENA
Well that’s something.
(Beat)
What else?
MARTIN
Erm... he looked very smart.
PHILOMENA
Oh I always dressed him smart. Can
you remember anything he said?
MARTIN
I... can’t.
(Thinks really hard)
Just... ‘hello’ or something. I’m
sorry.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 80.

PHILOMENA
(Repeating the word, as if
it were significant)
‘Hello.’
MARTIN
Might have been ‘Hi’.
By an effort of will she puts her disappointment behind her.
PHILOMENA
It doesn’t matter...
As she always does, PHILOMENA concentrates on the positive.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
(Big smile)
He was smart, and he had a firm
handshake.
She tries to convince herself that if this is all she finds
out about him, it will be enough. MARTIN is uncomfortable
with himself.

PHILOMENA is confronted with a table covered with photos of
Michael, stunned at this feast laid out for her - a feast of
memories she never had. There are a mix of formal and casual
photos. We see some of him with Marcia on his arm dressed
formally in evening wear.
MARCIA
I knew your son for about ten
years. He was senior legal counsel
to both the Reagan and Bush
administrations.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 81.

MARCIA WELLER, (the woman in the flashback video), is now ten
years older, a successful lawyer in her own right. PHILOMENA
picks up a photograph of Michael with President Reagan at the
function we saw in flashback earlier.
MARTIN
(To PHILOMENA)
Didn’t do too badly, did he?
PHILOMENA studies the picture.
PHILOMENA
He’d never have got a job like that
if he’d stayed with me.
(Staring at the photo, her
mind begins to drift)
I think he would have worked at
McEverleys.
She looks up, sees MARTIN’S and MARCIA’S blank faces.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
They’re a firm of solicitors in
Castlebar. Did he ever mention
Ireland to you Marcia?
MARCIA
I don’t think so - not that I
remember. But I have a number for
his sister, Mary, who came from
Ireland with him - I can put you in
touch with her?
MARTIN
Oh, excellent. That’s good news.
PHILOMENA picks up a photo of Michael in a garden, leaning
against some hay bales wearing a T-shirt and dungarees.
PHILOMENA
He looks very happy here, who’s
this fella?
She picks up a picture of Pete Olsson, tall, handsome,
bearded.
MARCIA
That’s his, er, friend - Pete.
She puts that photo down and picks up another of Michael and
Marcia on a night out together.
PHILOMENA
Were you his girlfriend Marcia?
MARCIA
Oh no. I loved Michael but not in
that way...

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 82.
MARCIA (cont'd)
(Looks at MARTIN, awkward)
... I don’t know if you knew, but
he was gay.

MARTIN seems to freeze at this news; PHILOMENA appears not to
react at all.
MARCIA (cont’d)
I would accompany him when he went
to official functions because being
gay was frowned upon in the
Republican party. But he was very
charming and very charismatic.
PHILOMENA clasps her chest.
PHILOMENA
I knew it Martin... I knew he’d be
charismatic.
(To MARCIA)
Now did he father any children
Marcia?
MARTIN
She just told us that Anthony was
gay.
PHILOMENA
Oh, I always knew that. I just
thought he might have been bicurious.
(They look at her)
A lot of the nurses I worked with
were gay but one of them, called
Brendan, told me he was bi-curious.
I don’t think he could make up his
mind Marcia.
MARCIA
He didn’t have any children. I’m
sorry.
PHILOMENA gives her a smile and a little nod then returns to
the pictures. She picks up a different photo of Michael in
Pete’s arms, both smiling, looking happy.
PHILOMENA
Did Pete love him?
MARCIA
Yes he did.

It’s all right Mary, I know that
Anthony was a gay homosexual. And
we met Marcia - who I believe was

MARTIN

Erm... yes, I think that’s about
right.
She turns to another picture of Michael, looking thin and
ill, and digests what it means.
PHILOMENA
It must have been terrible, having
to keep it a secret his whole life.
She’s talking about Anthony but we know she is also talking
about herself.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)

I assume my son died from Aids.
MARY
Yes. He did. He wasn’t too happy
with himself, last couple of years

Republicans.
MARTIN
The irony wasn’t lost on him.
MARY
No. He was pretty mixed up about
it.
PHILOMENA looks up, puzzled, from studying a photo.
MARTIN
(Explaining to PHILOMENA)
The Republicans cut funding into
Aids research because they blamed
the epidemic on gay lifestyles.

Ahhh - because some of them
wouldn’t wear condoms because they
said it spoilt the feeling.
See MARTIN and MARY, looking uncomfortable.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Where’s he buried Mary?
MARY
You know, I think it’s out in West
Virginia near where he lived. Dad
wanted him buried in the family
plot in St. Louis but Pete wouldn’t
allow it. They had a big row - I
didn’t go in the end, I didn’t want
to get involved. You should talk to
Pete about it.
A silence. The unfolding soap opera of Anthony’s life seems
alien to PHILOMENA. She feels disconnected, unable to relate
to it.
MARTIN
(Stepping in)
We got his number from Marcia we’ll go and see him, won’t we
Philomena.
PHILOMENA
Hmm...
PHILOMENA clutches at one last straw.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)

thing I’d like to know. Did Anthony
ever mention Ireland, or where he’d
come from?
MARY
(She thinks, then shrugs)
Not really. Neither of us really
talked about that.
PHILOMENA
No. Why would you...

Finally, she turns to him:

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 88.

PHILOMENA
I was going to ask you Martin, if
it would be possible to not use my
real name when you write the story?
He looks at her, doesn’t answer.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Perhaps you could call me Nancy?
I’ve always loved that name. My
niece is called Nancy... oh people might think it’s her.
(Thinks some more)
What about Helen? Helen Keller? No,
there’s someone already called
that, isn’t there.
MARTIN
I’m going to have to call you by
your real name, Philomena. That’s
the way it works. I’m sorry.
She thinks about this for a few moments, then goes back to
looking out of the window. A long beat, then:
PHILOMENA
I’d like to stop off and go to
confession, if we could find a
church on the way back.
MARTIN
(Beat)
If you don’t mind me asking, why do
you feel the need to go to
confession?
(She doesn’t answer)
It’s the Catholic Church should go
to confession.
(Beat)
Imagine that, the confession box
would explode.
PHILOMENA
In the greatest saint there is a
speck of dust, in the greatest
sinner, a spark of gold.
MARTIN
Is that right?
PHILOMENA
You learn that in the Bible.
MARTIN
Yes and it’s an interesting book
but there are other better books.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 89.

PHILOMENA

MARTIN
I don’t know...
He was going to drop it, but he starts to think of some
titles.
MARTIN (cont’d)

dressed simply, stand in front of the altar and genuflect.
She walks down the aisle, dips her fingers in the holy water
bowl near the exit, and blesses herself. As she passes MARTIN
on her way out she gives him a warm smile of open friendship,
which he feels compelled to return. The exchange unsettles

PHILOMENA
-because I don’t have a mortgage

(Calling out as he enters)
Concierge!
Seeing the room is empty MARTIN quickly heads for bathroom
door - knocking and then pushing it open. It’s empty.
MARTIN
Phil?
(Realising the BELLBOY is
watching him)

MARTIN comes back out into the room now starting to panic.

MARTIN steps out onto the balcony - and there is PHILOMENA,
standing gripping a hand rail, looking out at the city nightscape, eyes red and tear-stained.
MARTIN
There you are!
PHILOMENA
What’s the matter?
MARTIN
I wondered where you were.
BELLBOY
(From inside)
Is your mother okay now?
MARTIN
Yes, thanks.
BELLBOY
(From inside)
Okay sir.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 98.

MARTIN shoots an embarrassed glance to PHILOMENA as the
BELLBOY leaves.
MARTIN
I... had to say that to get him to
let me in.
(Embarrassed, quickly
changing the subject)
You shouldn’t have the balcony door
shut if you can’t hear the door to
the room.
PHILOMENA
I was just out here having a little
cry, that’s all.
She is quite calm - if anyone is distressed it’s MARTIN.
MARTIN
Right.
He nods his head, an awkward pause.
PHILOMENA
I hope you didn’t think I was going
to jump off the balcony?
A little smile plays across her lips as it occurs to her that
he might well have been thinking this.
MARTIN
No of course not. Can I, er... get
you anything?
PHILOMENA
No thank you. I just want to
have...
(Phrase pops into her
head)
-some quiet time.
MARTIN
Yes. Of course. Right, well I’ll
see you later.
MARTIN turns and leaves, duly dismissed and suddenly feeling
redundant.

MARTIN is at the bar, changed and showered, laptop in front

MARTIN
Pint of Guinness please.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 99.

As the BARMAN pours him one, MARTIN turns things over in his
mind.
CUT TO:
MARTIN sits at his laptop, but he’s distracted, can’t
concentrate. He studies the pint of Guinness in front of him.
He takes a sip, puts the glass down. As he studies it,
absentmindedly running his finger down the side of it,
something catches his eye: the trademark Guinness Celtic Harp
symbol on the side of the glass. He stares at it, thoughtful.
Remembering something. Suddenly, it all clicks into place but before he can do anything:
PHILOMENA
Martin, there’s something I have to
say to youHe looks up, surprised to see her down in the bar.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
I’ve made a decision and my mind’s
made up and there’s nothing you can
say that’s going to make me change
it.
(Beat)
I appreciate everything you’ve done
for me, and thank you for putting
up with me, I’ve enjoyed the hotels
and all the food and everything,
but this hasn’t really worked out
the way that I wanted it to. So,
tomorrow I think we should get on
an aeroplane and go back to
England. There it is, and that’s an
end to it.
(Beat)
And don’t try to change my mind by
saying all clever things and trying
to confuse me because I didn’t go
to Oxbridge like youMARTIN’S mobile starts to ring, interrupting the argument. He
checks the display: ‘Sally Mitchell’ and quickly kills the
call without answering. He looks at her:
MARTIN
Oxford. I went to Oxford - Oxbridge
is a portmanteau of Oxford and
Cambridge, that’s where two wordsPHILOMENA
I don’t give a shiny shoe about
that - it’s all the same to me!
MARTIN begins to fiddle with his lap-top.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 100.

MARTIN
I think we should go and visit Pete
Olsson tomorrow.
PHILOMENA
Go on your own! I’m not going all
that way just to hear another
person say that Anthony didn’t give
two hoots about me, and that I
abandoned him and all the rest of
it...
MARTIN points to the Harp symbol on the side of his pint of
Guinness.
MARTIN
What’s that?
PHILOMENA
All I want to do is go home and
mind my own business, and watch
David Attenborough on the telly and
I’ll be happy with that.
MARTIN
There. On the side of the glass.
What’s that?
He points more deliberately to the symbol.
PHILOMENA
It’s a Celtic harp.
MARTIN
Right...
He has found what he was looking for in his computer (though
we don’t yet see what he’s looking at). He now turns the
computer round to show her the picture of Anthony with
President Reagan, which we’ve seen before. He zooms in on
Anthony so it’s just him in the frame, and we can see that on
his jacket lapel he is wearing a gold Celtic Harp badge.
MARTIN (cont’d)
And what’s that?
PHILOMENA
(Beat)
A Celtic Harp.
MARTIN
If he cared so little about where
he came from, why would he wear
something so Irish?
She thinks about it all, slightly stunned at the
implications.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 101.

PHILOMENA
Perhaps he played the harp? He was
gay..?
MARTIN
He didn’t play the harp.

Leaning on a stick, clearly ill, gazing at the ruins and then
over to a loch; before him rolling hills and fields, a thin
mist hanging in the air. [NOTE: we do not yet know where this
is]. He then brings the camera round onto a shot of MICHAEL,
gazing out at it.

I think he would have been happy
living in a house like that, don’t

MARTIN
I wouldn’t complain.

She gazes at the house, delighting on every detail.

The car pulls forward. MARTIN surveys the empty drive.
MARTIN
We doorstep him.
PHILOMENA

MARTIN
It’s what nasty journalists do when
they want to speak to somebody who

She nods, thoughtfully, then sees something in the mirror:

I’m Martin Sixsmith, I’m here with
Philomena Lee, the mother of your

Sure enough, PETE’S immediate reaction is to shut the door on
him, but MARTIN jams his foot in it. He and PETE make eye
contact. So far so good.

He was taken from me. And I’ve been

CLOSE UP on a plasma screen. SCORE OVER the SUPER 8 footage
we saw earlier of little Anthony on the airport tarmac,
clutching his aeroplane and wearing his smart coat. The
footage moves into a CLOSE UP of little ANTHONY. Over this
image we now see PHILOMENA’S face appear, translucently, over
that of her son.
CUT TO:
PHILOMENA, flickering blue light playing across her glasses
as she watches the footage on the screen, tears in her eyes.
PETE sits next to her, holding her hand. MARTIN stands behind
her, also watching.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 106.

SCORE CONTINUES as PHILOMENA catches up on the moments from
Anthony’s/Michael’s life we have seen previously, (the little
boy on the tarmac; the birthday party; with Ronald Reagan;
the club in New York; with Pete etc.)
The two stories we have been watching now finally collide,
and we CUT BACK AND FORTH between PHILOMENA’S face and the
screen, each time tightening in on her. We see the ruined
Abbey amongst the images. Eventually we abandon the screen
and stay with PHILOMENA, closing in ever tighter as she
witnesses a life compacted, catching up on fifty missed years
with these magical, ghostly images.
Finally, she turns to MARTIN.
PHILOMENA
Isn’t he handsome Martin?
We are ON MARTIN, him watching the screen (which we don’t
see). He does not respond to Philomena, his eyes transfixed
by something he is looking at. Seeing his expression she
TURNS BACK, puzzled, to look at the screen - and her
expression pales.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
No...
PETE
What’s wrong?
And NOW we CUT TO the plasma screen and see MICHAEL...
outside Roscrea. He is being greeted warmly by the (now
elderly) Sister HILDEGARDE [NOTE - SISTER CLAIRE IS NOT IN
THE SHOT]. And this is the end of the journey started in
scene 89 - Michael’s journey back to Roscrea.
Suggest the insertion of a line at the following point, to
draw out Philomena’s reaction to Anthony coming back to
Roscrea:

*
*

MARTIN
He went to Ireland? He went to
Roscrea...?
PETE
I took him. He was looking for you,
Philomena.

PHILOMENA
(looking at the screen)
He came to look for me?

*

MARTIN
(Pointing to HILDEGARDE)
That nun... I saw her at Roscrea on
our last trip.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 107.

PHILOMENA
Sister Hildegard.
MARTIN
She’s very old now but it was
definitely her.
PHILOMENA
They always told me they didn’t
know where Anthony was.
PETE looks confused.
PETE
But they told us that they couldn’t
find you. They said you’d abandoned
him as a baby.
PHILOMENA
(Whisper, voice full of
emotion)
I did not abandon my child.
MARTIN gets up, unable to contain his emotions.
MARTIN
She was looking for him! She’s
spent her whole life trying to find
him.
PETE
He’s there now.
MARTIN
What do you mean?
PETE
I had this huge standoff with his
father. He wanted him buried in the
US, but it was your son’s dying
wish. He said he wanted to go home.
Beat. Silence.
PETE (cont’d)
He’s buried at Roscrea.
During this we have been moving slowly in on PHILOMENA’S
face; now she closes her eyes, clutches her hand to her chest
and sighs.

YOUNG NUN
Sister Claire has asked if you

MARTIN gives PHILOMENA a thunderous look ‘after all that’s
happened they still want to make you wait?’ But as the YOUNG
NUN leaves the room and they sit down in chairs facing the
window, PHILOMENA leans in and speaks quietly to him:
PHILOMENA
Now remember Martin, it’s not her
fault. She didn’t know that Anthony
had a different name.
Of course she is saying this as much to herself as Martin.
Frustrated, he leans back in his chair in angry silence, gets
up, paces about. He stops to look at a classic ‘Sacred Heart’
image of Jesus on the wall, one so familiar to Irish
households: Christ, palms turned outwards, displays stigmata
wounds, and his heart is visible beneath his robes, glowing
and enveloped in a crown of thorns. He turns to see PHILOMENA
sitting on the edge of her chair, bag on her lap, waiting so
obediently that he is irritated by her. He looks at his watch
- the delay in seeing them is outrageous. He can’t stand it
in this room any more and slips quietly outside.

from a door to his left, SISTER CLAIRE and a PRIEST emerge.
As they shut the door behind them he sees, in the room behind
them, in a wheelchair, Sister HILDEGARDE. This is who he is
looking for.
SISTER CLAIRE
Excuse me what do you think you’re
doing here?
MARTIN
I just want to ask Sister
Hildegarde something.
The YOUNG NUN enters the TV room behind him, breathless,
having followed him.
YOUNG NUN
(To SISTER CLAIRE)
He just walked straight in.
They are momentarily distracted by her, and MARTIN uses this
to slip past them and reach HILDEGARDE’s door.

This is completely inappropriate
behaviour!

behind him.

her wheelchair by her desk, looking up at him, startled. From
outside, banging on the door.
SISTER CLAIRE (V.O.)
Open this door! She’s an old lady!
MARTIN
I’m not here to hurt you, I’ve just
come to ask you a question. I’m a
friend of Philomena Lee...
HILDEGARDE’S eyes narrow. There is no way she is going to
talk to this man. Especially not about ‘her’. He pulls a
chair up to her, keeping himself at her level so as not to
appear to be physically threatening.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 111.

MARTIN (cont’d)
Why did you do it?
(Beat, no response)
When a mother and son were
searching for each other, why did
you keep them apart?
HILDEGARDE looks at him, her expression that of a wily old
fox. But still she refuses to answer.
Then, a door on the other side of the room - the one that
opens into the corridor and which was previously locked,
suddenly opens. SISTER CLAIRE - who has a master key - and
the PRIEST have doubled back and now burst in. MARTIN stands
up to face them.
PRIEST
We’re going to call the police
unless you leave immediately.
MARTIN
I’m not leaving without an answer.
PRIEST
I’m sorry I think your whole
manner, coming in to a holy place
like this, and behaving the way you
have, is absolutely disgusting.
He turns back to HILDEGARDE, sits down again careful not to
tower over her, his tone still reasonable.

MARTIN
(Low voice, in control)
I’ll tell you what’s disgusting,
lying to a dying man.
(Directly to HILDEGARDE)
You could have given them a few
precious moments with his mother
before he passed away - but you
chose to lie. That’s disgusting.
SISTER CLAIRE
Come on Sister Hildegarde, you
don’t have to listen to this.
Sister CLAIRE starts to wheel her away from Martin.
SISTER HILDEGARDE
Not very Christian is itThis is too much for the old nun to bear - she grabs the
wheels of her wheelchair and stops her. Finally, HILDEGARDE
speaks, jabbing a bony finger at MARTIN.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 112.

SISTER HILDEGARDE (cont’d)
Let me tell you something - I have
kept my vow of chastity my whole
life. Self denial and mortification
of the flesh, that’s what brings us
closer to God.
SISTER CLAIRE
Sister HildegardeShe wants to shut HILDEGARDE up - she clearly views her as a
liability. HILDEGARDE ignores her:
SISTER HILDEGARDE
Those girls have nobody to blame
but themselves, and their own
carnal incontinence.
SISTER CLAIRE
Sister Hildegarde - please!
MARTIN
You mean they had sex?
SISTER HILDEGARDE
What’s done is done - what do you
expect us to do about it now?
PHILOMENA
Nothing. There’s nothing to be
said. I’ve found my son, that’s
what I came here for.
The room falls quiet. MARTIN sees PHILOMENA standing at the
door Sister Claire and the Priest came through.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
(She wants to go)
Martin.
MARTIN
Hang on hang on.
He turns back to HILDEGARDE. He is starting to lose it.
MARTIN (cont’d)
What you can do is say sorry! How
about that? Apologise. And then you
can go out there and clear all the
weeds and crap off the graves of
the mothers and babies who died
here. Stop trying to hide them
away.
HILDEGARDE
Their suffering was atonement for
their sins.

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 113.

MARTIN
One of them was fourteen years old!
PHILOMENA
(Sharply)
That’s enough Martin!
HILDEGARDE
The Lord Jesus Christ will be my
judge - not the likes of you.
MARTIN
Really? Because I think if Jesus
was here right now he’d tip you out
of that fucking wheelchair - and
you wouldn’t get up and walk.
PHILOMENA
Stop it! Stop it!
(To CLAIRE and the PRIEST)
I’m sorry, I didn’t want him to
come in here like this and make a
scene.
MARTIN gets up and goes over to PHILOMENA. We see a pious
smile creep across HILDEGARDE’S face.
MARTIN
(Incredulous)
Why are you apologizing to them?
Anthony was dying of Aids and she
still wouldn’t tell him about you.
PHILOMENA
I know! But it happened to me. Not
you. And it’s up to me what to do
about all this. It’s my choice.
MARTIN
So you’re just going to do nothing?
PHILOMENA
No.
(Beat)
I’m going to forgive.
(Turns to Sister
Hildegarde))
Sister Hildegarde, I want you to
know that I forgive you.
HILDEGARDE’S face drops and she turns her head away from
PHILOMENA with an angry grunt, much happier with Martin’s
abuse than Philomena’s forgiveness. MARTIN looks at
PHILOMENA, floored.
MARTIN
What..? Just like that?

PHILOMENA - Final Shooting Script 114.

PHILOMENA
It’s not ‘just like that’! It’s
hard. It’s a hard thing to do.
(Tears in her eyes)
I don’t want to hate people.
Look at you. I don’t want to be
like you.
MARTIN
(Close to tears with anger
and frustration)
I’m angry!
PHILOMENA
I know. It must be exhausting.
PHILOMENA smiles. She feels much better now.
PHILOMENA (cont’d)
Sister Claire, would you be kind
enough to take me to my son’s
grave.
A silence. Sister CLAIRE stands.
CLAIRE
Of course.
Sister CLAIRE leads PHILOMENA out into the corridor. MARTIN
is left alone for a moment with the PRIEST and HILDEGARDE,
who glares at him. He turns to go, then hesitates.

Same size shot, PHILOMENA present day. She stands. She is
smiling, turns to MARTIN.

MARTIN
I’m not going to publish the story.

She looks at him confused.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
It’s just between you and him.

She smiles, deeply moved.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Here, I got you something.

MARTIN reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a little
plastic Jesus he has bought from the shop; the figure’s palms
outstretched, his heart visible through his garments. He
hands it to PHILOMENA.
PHILOMENA
Oh Martin...

She takes it from him and smiles, gratefully. She kneels,
places the plastic Jesus on Anthony’s Grave.

PHILOMENA (CONT’D)

Thank you.
She crosses herself. As she looks at the plastic Jesus:

PHILOMENA (CONT’D)
You know, I’d just decided that I
did want you to tell my story after
all...

She walks away from the grave. He follows. And now we...

MARTIN and PHILOMENA walk back arm in arm to their hire car
parked at the front of the Abbey. They are closer than ever
after all they’ve been through; MARTIN helps her in then, as
he goes to get in his side:
PHILOMENA (CONT’D)
Oh, Martin, I’ve just finished that
book, ‘The Saddle and the Loom’ would you like to read it?

He gets in, shuts the door and starts up.
MARTIN
Why don’t you just tell me about
it.
As the car drives away, from inside:
PHILOMENA (OOV)
Well there’s this weaver, she’s
quite plain really, pretty but
plain, and she’s told she has to
work all through the night to weave
a beautiful cloak of the finest
silk for the master - this nobleman
fella - to wear on his wedding
day...

The hire car winds it’s way through the breathtaking scenery.
From inside, PHILOMENA continues with the story...
PHILOMENA (OOV)
... and so she works all through
the night and she shows him the
cloak and asks him what do you
think kind sir? And he says ‘it’s
beautiful - I’ve never seen
anything more beautiful in my whole
life’. But guess what, he’s not
even looking at the cloak. He’s
looking at her Martin! Well, I
never saw that coming.
MARTIN
Not in a million years...

LYRICS TO ‘PLASTIC JESUS’
I don’t care if it rains or freezes
As long as I’ve got my Plastic
Jesus
Riding on the dashboard of my car,
You can buy Him phosphorescent
Glows in the dark, He’s Pink and
Pleasant
Take Him with you when you’re
travelling far.
You can buy a Sweet Madonna
