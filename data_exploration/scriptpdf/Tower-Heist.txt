INT./EXT. MANHATTAN - DAYBREAK
(and QUEENS, and BROOKLYN, NEWARK, STATEN ISLAND, THE BRONX,
HARLEM, and the disappearing corners of Manhattan that under
overpasses, or too close to soup kitchens to have become
gentrified). (TITLE SEQUENCE)
We’ll see A SERIES of SHOTS of the city waking up.
Except that it’s two cities:
One, the sparkle-y winner-take-all Manhattan of the movies,
“The Apprentice,” and Eva Gabor.
Two, the get-real Manhattan where the regular people, whose
daily sweat makes Sparkle-y Manhattan go, begin their hardworking day.
Over the beepings/shrillings/radio blarings of various ALARMS
we see QUICK CUTS of TENEMENT PIPES shuddering as rusty water
spatters onto three squirming kids in a bathtub, being
hastily bathed by their bi-racial mother.. to MULTIPLE jets
of a WaterWorks shower pummelling the backside of a
SUPERMODEL...
We see ARMS going into uniform sleeves, to ARMS going into a
Dolce & Gabanna chemise... Dr. Scholl’s pads going into
sensible shoes... manicured toes going into thousand dollar
platforms with six inch heels.
We see name tags pinned on front pockets.... bow ties
clipped onto collars... to A ROLEX being fastened around a
man’s wrist... back to...
AN OLD GUY (LESTER) sits at the kitchen table of his Lower
East Side one bedroom, which has seen no renovation since
they put in hot water in the ‘30’s. He is painstakingly
SEWING A BUTTON on the sleeve of his DOORMAN’S UNIFORM.
EXT. MANHATTAN AND BOROUGHS - DAY
VARIOUS SHOTS of the underclasses moving towards their
jobs... and their overlords perhaps going to work, perhaps
not. TENNIS SHOED FEET step down stairs to SUBWAY STATIONS.
MAGLI SHOED feet get out of LIMOS. AWNINGS pulled down on
VENDOR CARTS... ITALIAN SILK SHADES pulled down so a RICH
GIRL can go back to bed. A messenger on a bicycle is grazed
by a BMW. The well dressed driver zips down his window,
craning his neck -- not to see if the messenger’s okay, but
instead to inspect his car for scratches.
Towards the gleaming towers of Midtown, the employed
underclass is walking, walking...

2.
... from the other direction walk a couple of CLUBBING RICH
KIDS, still in their party clothes, having been out all
night...
... Hardhats edge around them, just trying to get the hell to
their jobs..
... PAMPERED DOG PAWS are also walking.

TILT UP TO REVEAL:

One person walking is a uniformed black man, 30’s, MR.
WASHINGTON. He is walking SIX pedigreed DOGS in front of A
SLEEK, STATE OF THE ART MODERN LUXURY BUILDING.
(AND GUYS, IF WE WANT TO DO AN HOMAGE TO THIS KIND OF LATE
60’s/EARLY 70’s HEIST ENERGY, WE COULD DO A WINDOWPANE SCREEN
EFFECT, WITH MANY SHOTS OF WILDLY ECONOMICALLY DIVERGENT NEW
YORKERS... from satellite dishes on cardboard boxes to
helipads on buildings... you get the idea...)
One of the dogs slips its leash! A silky AFGHAN makes a
break for freedom, dashing down the sidewalk as, coming
around the corner, we see-5TH AVENUE/59TH STREET N R W
COLE HOWARD, on one side or the other of 40. He takes in the
tableau at a glance -- the screaming dog-walker trying to
catch up, the bounding Afghan.
In a swift move, Cole plunks down 2 dollars on a vendor’s
cart and grabs a small SHISH KEBAB, waving it at the dog’s
eye level. The hound stops instantly, practically levitates
to get the meat, as MR. WASHINGTON, the dog walker, catches
up.
MR. WASHINGTON
Mr. Howard -- ahhh, thanks -COLE
Carry a stash of treats, Mr.
Washington -- you’re competing with
every enticing smell in Manhattan.
Cole goes into the building.

Mr. Washington watches after

MR. WASHINGTON
Yeah, aren’t we all.

3.
EXT. FOYER OF BUILDING - DAY
LESTER, the old doorman, now in full uniform, smiles at Cole,
the Residence Manager, as he strides in, clearly in charge of
the place.
COLE
Morning, Lester.
LESTER
Looking to be a fine day, Mr.
Howard.
FROM A HIGH ANGLE, LOOKING DOWN on Cole, and for the first
time we catch a glimpse of this building: sleek, modern, the
jewel of the block.
ABOVE A STAFF ENTRANCE, a security camera peers down. ON A
PLASMA SECURITY MONITOR, DISPLAYING NUMEROUS ANGLES: Cole
shoots a salute to the camera and -- BUZZZZZZ! -INT. THE TOWER -- BACK HALLWAYS -- DAY
-- he’s admitted inside. Cole pushes on down the corridor,
passing maids, porters, attendants -- offering each a
friendly, firm smile.
COLE
Morning. Morning, Miss Lewis, your
son better? Good. Mr. Stuart,
there’re some Vodka bottles on the
roof deck... school’s obviously
out... Mrs. Lopez, the elevator’s
reeking--!
The STOUT HISPANIC JANITRESS nods vigorously, rolling her
eyes. She holds up an ANTISCEPTIC SPRAY BOTTLE: she’s on it.
MRS. LOPEZ
You don’t got to tell me! The
cheap cologne on that guy, oh my
God!
COLE
Miss Lopez. Residents’ guests who
wear miniskirts are women, until we
are otherwise instructed.
She nods.

Cole points at a DARK CAR

4.
COLE (CONT’D)
What’s with the tinted windows
across the street?
GUARD
Don’t know. Been there all night.
COLE
Keep an eye. It’s not your typical
towncar.
CHARLIE GIBBS, concierge, Cole’s age, falls into stride with
him. They’ve been ten years on the job together.
Morning.
Mr. Gibbs.

CHARLIE
COLE

CHARLIE
What’d you do this weekend?
COLE
Worried about this place.
CHARLIE
Y’know it is our 10 year
anniversary. Think you could start
calling me Charlie?
COLE
(only half joking)
And that’s the beginning of the
end. Next it’ll be “bro” and
“Dude,” and the discipline around
here’ll go straight to hell. Even
talking about it opens a crack into
the abyss.
They enter-INT. TOWER -- LOBBY -- DAY
The most elegant, most comfortable private lobby in NYC. A
three-story high ceiling with a glass wall filling the space
with light. A cherry-oak-paneled concierge’s counter topped
with Egyptian marble. Designer divans and reading chairs
galore and a zen fountain.
Charlie points towards the front door, at LESTER, the doorman
we saw earlier. Well into his 70s, he knows no greater
pleasure than doing his job well.

5.
CHARLIE
What about him?
A GAGGLE of KIDS swarm through the lobby, off to school.
Cole knows all their names. Their favorite, however, is
Lester: he’s a giant teddy bear to them.
LESTER
Who did their homework for today?
Whatya mean no homework today?! Why
not?! Oh, cause it’s the first day
of school!! ...
Lester opens the door for the kids.

They rush out.

COLE
What about him?
CHARLIE
You call Lester, Lester.
COLE
I prefer Lester to you.
Cole pats Charlie on the shoulder and goes -- he obviously
likes Charlie enough to bust his balls. (And we will soon
see that he is actually more informal with Charlie than
anyone in the place.)
The lobby is coming to life, now. All staff wear an earpiece
and a mic clipped to their sleeve, except Cole who keeps a
slender walkie in his breast pocket.
COLE (CONT’D)
Everyone awake? Okay, service with
a smile.
The staff, at their stations, nod back.
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN AND AN OVERLY BEJEWELED WOMAN EXITS.
Cole is there to welcome her; today’s performance has begun.
She doesn’t break stride, just starts barking “favors.”
BEJEWELED WOMAN
Cole, my day today is a ballbuster.
At ten a man’s coming from Pierre
Laveurre to measure for my
valances... then the TV lift
bandits are coming, again -- it’s
still having these epileptic
seizures--

6.
Thus begins A MONTAGE OF COLE’S MORNING. He is a master at
handling each resident: he compliments, he cajoles, with
children he clowns, to older residents he kowtows. As he
accepts each resident “request,” Charlie keeps a discreet todo list at his desk.
VARIOUS RESIDENTS
...pick up my dry-cleaning/... move
the armoire/ stir the
confit/appraise the
Monet.../...feed the finches/...the
moth larvae will have to be picked,
nit by nit, off those sweaters/...
Cole’s just as good with staff. Later, eying some NEW,
PETITE SIZED LINGERIE on a rack, he delegates to a PORTER:
COLE
...ah, ah, no -- not to the
apartment, to Mr. Davis’s office...
(low)
.. Mrs. Davis is a size 12.
Cole talks a mile a minute into his mouthpiece, directing and
redirecting building traffic.
COLE (CONT’D)
...It’s 7:45 and I’m still seeing
laundry carts. You should all be
on your way... Mr. Hutensky, Mrs.
Simon is still missing her Mercedes
key. -- Well, that dog does eat
just about anything, I’m afraid
you’re going to have to do some...
panning for gold. Miss Hahn, be
aware, the windows in 66B have
been removed, try not to plunge to
your deaths...
Under Cole’s running patter we see MORE MONTAGE: VARIOUS
SHOTS of the minute details that makes running a full service
luxury building so complex: Beds made/plants watered/a Venus
Flytrap plant fed meat/BROWN HANDS picking up JEWELRY off a
dresser and dusting the dresser before meticulously replacing
the jewelry, unmolested... MAIDS in OVERCOATS even vacuum an
66B, an apartment that’s A CONSTRUCTION SITE, freezing wind
blowing in through the gaping holes where the windows are
still missing.
AT THE PACKAGE STATION a pert Hispanic girl, PEREZ,
discreetly reads a book. Suddenly, in her earpiece:

7.
COLE’S VOICE
Miss Perez--?
(as she jumps)
For six months I’ve pretending not
to notice you’ve been studying for
the bar. Please don’t make it so
obvious that the residents notice
too.
She blushes, nods, and better buries her books, grateful for
his lenience.
INT. GUARD STATION - DAY
The two guards continue to stare, on screen, at the mystery
parked car.
COLE’S VOICE
...Steve, Miguel, has it moved?
GUARD #1
No sir!
(clicking off, turns to
friend)
What’s he going so crazy for?
this building ever been hit?
Shit, no.

GUARD #2

GUARD #1
It’s probably just some guy getting
a blow job.
GUARD #2
For a day and a half?
GUARD #1
Maybe he’s 80.
They laugh. MONTAGE CONTINUES: Cole besieged by residents.
(The first is a stringy, edgy, rich woman, Miss
Hollingsworth. We will be seeing her again.)
HOLLINGSWORTH/VARIOUS RESIDENTS
Make sure Mother takes her Lexapro
AND her Atavin -- one without the
other she behaves like a
Chimpanzee/...

The CAMERA JUMPS BACK from Cole, handling 11 things at once,
BACK to a long shot of the lobby, BACK to the exterior of the
building, looking in, BACK from ACROSS THE STREET...
Someone, with very professional equipment, is watching the
building through a telephoto lens.

looks around.

But ever vigilant, he

COLE
--So where’s our new elevator
man...? Isn’t he starting today?
CHARLIE
Looks like he’s jumped the gun.
He gestures at THE ELEVATOR BANK, where ARTHUR BRANIFF, 60,
gets off the elevator, MR. DEV’REAUX, dapper in his new
uniform, happily chatting while manning the elevator.
Despite his $200 haircut and hand-tailored dress shirt and
Caribbean tan, Braniff is a master at getting people to
forget Fitzgerald’s maxim about the rich (”They’re different
than you and me”).
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Well, Jamal, nice t’ meecha.
DEV’REAUX
Pleasure, sir!
Cole turns to Charlie, nonplussed.
“Jamal?”

COLE

CHARLIE
Told a resident his first name...?!
Uh uh uh.

9.
Cole wants to yank Dev’reaux aside, but Braniff seems to be
enjoying the encounter, so Cole keeps a smile on his face for
a moment more.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Jamaal, has Cole taught you the
golden rule of working here yet?
COLE
(shooting daggers at
Deveraux)
We haven’t actually run Mr.
Devr’eaux through the protocol...
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Jamaal, if I asked you, would you
go pick me up a cheeseburger?
Of course.

DEV’REAUX

ARTHUR BRANIFF
Thing is, I want a certain kind of
brie on my burger they only sell at
Michel’s cheese shop downtown.
Think you can get that first?
DEV’REAUX
Certainly, Mr. Braniff.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
As for the hamburger, only
organically-fed, free-range beef,
please. Can you make sure of that?
DEV’REAUX
I think so.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Finally the buns. This is the most
important part. I need the buns
blessed by the pope himself. See
to it, willya?
DEV’REAUX
(catching on)
Got the Vatican on speed-dial.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
He’s a natural.
(to Dev)
Always say yes. That’s the golden
rule. Say yes, then figure out how
the hell you’re gonna manage it.

ARTHUR BRANIFF (CONT'D)
I may live at the top of this
building but I’m in the service
industry same as you and Cole, and
I know soon as I say ‘no’ to a
customer, I’m flat-out on my ass.
Braniff gives Dever’aux a $100 bill.
ARTHUR BRANIFF (CONT’D)
Another thing, Jamaal: I do
everything myself. Keeps me honest.
I’ll get my own cheeseburger, and
you get one too, on me!
As Braniff wanders off, Dever’aux’s suddenly sees-LOBBY SEATING AREA -- COFFEE TABLE -- DAY
A copy of NEWSWEEK is casually splayed across the coffee
table, a PICTURE of ARTHUR BRANIFF on the COVER! Dev’raux
doubletakes, staring at the photo, as Cole steps into frame
beside him.
DEVER’AUX
He’s pretty real for...
(picks up magazine)
...”The Wall Street Wizard?!”
Wow.

COLE
Mr. Dever’aux, as you can see, some
of our residents are pretty high
profile individuals. What made you
think you should jump in without
any orientation?
MR. DEVERAUX
Well, pushing buttons, shooting the
breeze, I mean -- I know the job.
Charlie and Cole exchange a look.
COLE
Remind me: where did we steal you
away from?
DEV’REAUX

Richelieu on 78th.
COLE
That’s a good building.

Why’d you

11.
DEV’REAUX
You wanna play baseball, you gonna
wanna play someday for the Yankees.
This building’s the Yankees.
COLE
(not unkindly)
Then don’t treat it like the sand
lot. “Pushing buttons” and
“shooting the breeze” is seriously
demeaning your job. You are
crucial to these people: you are
part of protecting them.
DEV’REAUX
From what, sir?
Cole gestures across the lobby, where Arthur Braniff has been
stopped by an anxious-looking MIDDLE AGED GUY in a SUIT.
This is FITZHUGH.
COLE
He’s gone ten steps, and he’s
already under attack from Mr.
Fitzhugh over there, a much less
successful money manager who’s
desperate for tips. Mr. Gibbs,
head him off, please...
Charlie quickly speeds off to stop this encounter.
FITZHUGH is already in mid-pitch.

Mr.

MR. FITZHUGH
--I did try your office, but
everything’s on voice mail -- if
you could just -- one millisecond -see, I’m having a hell of a time

suggestion... just the wisp of a
hint... would really help me out of

Quickly, to Braniff:
Thank you!
He scurries off.

MR. FITZHUGH (CONT’D)
We’ll reconvene soon!

Charlie sighs to Braniff.

CHARLIE
Mr. Howard apologizes.

He got past

ARTHUR BRANIFF
I can’t really blame Fitzhugh.
He’s losing his apartment.
(sighs)
Tough times make civilized people
do uncivilized things.
Braniff shrugs affably and goes. Meanwhile, across the
lobby, Cole continues to brief Mr. Dev’reaux.
COLE
After the doorman admits a visitor,
you’re their second line of
defense. And your antenna should
be out at all times for anyone
going up in your car who gives you
even the smallest uneasy feeling...
His eye drifts towards...
EXT.

THROUGH THE LOBBY FRONT GLASS - COLE’S POV - DAY

The TINTED WINDOW CAR still sits, mysteriously, across the
street. Two OVERCOATED MEN walk past.
COLE
Like those two.
He walks outside, Lester opening the door, Dever’aux at his
heels.
EXT.

THE BUILDING - DAY

Cole watches the men continue down the street, then turns to
Dev’reaux, explaining.
COLE
That’s the second time they’ve
walked by the building from the
same direction. May be nothing,
but it’s a little off.
DEV’REAUX
Man. Not even your job, but you
notice everything!
COLE
It’s all my job. There’s a
cellular structure to a full
service building -- in order to
keep this hive running we all
exceed our job descriptions.
(MORE)

13.
COLE (CONT'D)
These residents won’t notice
ordinary service -- only the
extraordinary service will get you
that bonus.
Cole gives the building’s perimeter a once-over. He spies a
scrap of trash at the curb and squats to pick it up.
Dev’reaux just stares.

That’s dedication.

EXT. THE TOWER -- FROM HIGH ABOVE -- DUSK
A tarp covering the absent window on 66 flaps in the wind as
the sun goes down.
Below, Mr. Washington exits the staff entrance, in his
civvies, knocking off for the night. He passes MISS
HOLLINGSWORTH, the stringy, nasty woman we met earlier.
MR. WASHINGTON
Evening, Miss. Hollingsworth.
(the woman startles)
--It’s just me, Mr. Washington.
Oh!

Oh.

MISS HOLLINGSWORTH

MR. WASHINGTON
Out of uniform. Got it.
He keeps his expression cheerful, but drops it the minute she
goes on her way. Racist bitch!
INT. THE TOWER -- BACK HALLWAYS -- MOMENTS LATER
ON A CHECK: “Alimony -- September.” Cole’s mailing his
monthly dues as Charlie, in civvies now, raps on the door.
Exiting, Cole and Charlie pass the LOCKER ROOM. Cole leans
in to kill the light, to find Lester still here, gazing into
space.
Lester?

CHARLIE
You okay?

LESTER
...just gettin’ my shoes on... I’ll
be outta here in a jiff...
Cole eyes Lester, knows the old man has something on his
mind.

14.

What.

COLE

LESTER
Naw, it’s a long day for you, Mr.
Howard...
Cole smiles.
COLE
And now it’s over, and I have time.
What.
LESTER
It’s just, ah... I uh, I asked Mr.
Simon a few weeks ago to get me
some funds from my 401 thing -(quickly)
--not playin’ the horses or
anything, Mr. Howard -- my little
grandkids out in California, their
daddy got laid off, and they’re
feeling the pinch, you know-COLE
For you to even bring it up, it’s
more than a pinch.
LESTER
Well, they’re behind kinda every
which way...
COLE
Losing their house?
LESTER
(sighs)
Yeah, if I don’t help...
COLE
Of course, why wouldn’t you help?
LESTER
Well, that’s just it... Mr. Simon,
he hasn’t given me the money.
COLE
When did you ask him?
LESTER
Six weeks ago.
COLE
And you still don’t have the money.

15.
LESTER
He says that the bank’s gonna get
to it.
COLE
Well you’re -(not wanting to guess
Lester’s age)
--of a certain age, you can take
that money out. This makes no
sense at all.
LESTER
Banks get busy, like anybody.
COLE
Not with our pension plan.
INT. THE TOWER -- MR. SIMON’S OFFICE -- DAY
Doorplate: “PROPERTY MANAGER.” Mr. Simon sits and peruses his
Wall Street Journal a moment before he addresses Cole.
MR. SIMON
The economy’s in the crapper, Cole.
COLE
With all due respect, sir, I don’t
really see how that entitles a bank
to stall giving Lester some of his
money.
MR. SIMON
Everyone’s cutting staff.
COLE
Then the remaining bank employees
can work free overtime, as we do.
There is a subtle dig there, but Cole keeps his expression
pleasant and professional.
MR. SIMON
Don’t get smart. The resident
board thinks we may have some staff
redundancies.
COLE
Whoa, Whoa: cut OUR staff? My
people are out there busting their--

16.
MR. SIMON
(raises a hand: enough)
I just want to prepare you for
possible contingencies.
Mr. Simon simply picks up his newspaper and starts reading.
The interview is over.
MR. SIMON (CONT’D)
Hang up the Christmas tapestry
tomorrow, please.
COLE
It’s already done.
EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- NIGHT
Cole, Charlie and Lester exit the building together, heading
to their various homes. Cole notices: the tinted window car
is still sitting there. And -- across the street -- there’s
ANOTHER ONE!
COLE
There’s two of them, now?
haven’t they been towed?

Why

CHARLIE
(shrugs)
Call the city.
COLE
We did. They’re doing nothing -no, really, it makes no sense -Cole finally lets Charlie pull him along, down the sidewalk,
walking along with Lester, pleased to have company. At a bus
stop, they wait with Lester for his crosstown, Cole trying
not to flick a glance back at the mystery cars.
LESTER
-- the littlest one tells me the
other day on the phone: “Grandpa,
what’s invisible and smells like
worms?” “Bird farts,” he says. The
way he laughed at his own joke I
just about died.
COLE
You ever think about moving out
there?

17.
LESTER
Nah. I can help ‘em out more from
here, and no use pretending I don’t
love the job...
COLE
Lester. The day you go, we change
the name of the building, cause
it’ll never be the same.
Nothing could mean more to Lester. His bus arrives.
LESTER
Night, Mr. Howard.

Mr. Gibbs.

COLE
Lester, outside the building...?
It’s just Cole.
Charlie drops his jaw. He’s never seen Cole give that
permission to anyone. They watch Lester step aboard, then
proceed to the subway.
INT.

CHET AND MARTY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

All that is mundane and lower middle class in Queens. The
house is festooned with cheap BIRTHDAY BALLOONS AND
STREAMERS. MARTY, Cole’s mother, 60’s, sympathetic and kind,
if a bit timid, admits Cole, who is holding a PRESENT.
COLE

MARTY

People are toasting and mingling around a nervous looking
Walt. He can’t stop thinking about that pile of paper on his
desk.
SLIDE (O.S.)
Hey, here’s my present, Mr. H.
SLIDE is a sharp-looking black man, about Cole’s age, a
little too flashily dressed for a modest birthday party.
However, he seems very comfortable with these people. He
hands Walt an iPhone, out of a satchel in which Cole can see - there are about 20 of them, all in their original boxes.
Walt is very fond of Slide, but is immediately suspicious.
WALT
Do you have a receipt for this?

19.
SLIDE
Ah, now, we’re not gonna start
that--!
WALT
No, really, Darnell--!
SLIDE
Shit, nobody call me that now-MARTY
Well, we just can’t help
remembering the old days...!
There are PICTURES on the wall of kindergarden buds, 5 YEAR
OLD SLIDE and 5 YEAR OLD COLE, with their arms around each
other.
COLE
He’s been Slide for a while, Mom.
Cole and Slide appraise each other and smile, two old friends
whose lives have gone in entirely different directions.

Hey.

SLIDE

Hey.

COLE
You don’t still live around

Slide just laughs.
Okay.

Never mind.

Cole looks around, notices the house is all torn up. Most
notably, the kitchen. Like, they’re cooking on a HOT PLATE.

A CAB - MOVING - NIGHT

Cole sits in the back seat, cab racing along, practically
levitating with anxiety. He is on the phone.
COLE

COLE
Okay, where are they?
The guards look around.
GUARD #1
I don’t see ‘em now. But when the
wind blew their coats against them,
you could see it -- they’re
definitely packing.
Cole notices: the TINTED WINDOW CAR IS NOW ACROSS THE STREET

COLE
God damn it -- enough!
He marches up to the car, starts banging on the windows.

They are casually dressed.

The technician obeys.
Their SHOES are EXPENSIVE ITALIAN LEATHER.

The brinks truck, all its right tires shot out, is fatally

Cole and the guards race towards it with everything they’ve

the DRIVER and HELPER jump out and run for it.
Cole and the guards have more important matters. They race
to the now-stopped truck. Cole gestures to Guard #1 to shoot

There is no mink inside the plastic. Instead, hanging

Cole’s jaw drops.

Arthur sighs impatiently.

The agent zips open a compartment, pulls out a PASSPORT,
flips it open. It has Arthur’s face on it, but not his name.
The other agents pull CASH and DOCUMENTS out of the other
envelopes.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
This proves nothing.
AGENT DENHAM
Yeah. I guess everybody puts fake
passports, account numbers and wads
of Euros in mothball storage. I

The agents cuff him and lead him down the alley, where Cole
can see SCADS OF REPORTERS and a few POLICE waiting,
flashbulbs already popping.
COLE
The underground exit might be more
discreet.
AGENT DENHAM
Oh no. Mr. Braniff’s getting the

Cole volunteers his jacket to be laid over Braniff’s cuffs.

EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS
A crowd has gathered outside along with a NEWS CREW to
document Braniff’s walk of shame. Agent Denham escorts him
to a squad car, loading him into the rear seat. She returns
Cole’s jacket and Cole looks from her to Braniff, not sure
what to believe. The police caravan pulls away and Cole
steers Mrs. Braniff away from cameras.

hands unbound this time. He’s assaulted with questions from
the press. Fighting through them, he stops to declare:

The hostile clamor of the crowd outside is replaced by an icy
silence inside as Braniff finds himself face-to-face with the

At least let him have access to the

AGENT DENHAM
Mr. Klein, the rules of your
client’s occupancy here are simple:
he leaves the apartment for any
reason, he gets remanded to federal
custody and forfeits his ten
million dollars bail. If your
client wants fresh air so badly, I
suggest he stick his head out a
window. Or in an oven. --What is

He can’t believe it.

show.

I wanted to bring you up to speed
on some restrictions to Mr.
Braniff’s stay here.

Mr. Braniff may receive no visitors
without authorization from my
office and a federal officer
present. That includes family
members, Mr. Klein here, even your
staff. Any mail incoming or
outgoing must be vetted by my
office. Also, you should prepare
your staff for an onslaught of food
deliveries: the Braniffs will be
eating in for the foreseeable
future. Questions?
Cole doesn’t have any. He stares at the opulence of the
Austin Martin, then back at Braniff, who remains cool as a

when he started cashing out his
buddies. We all wondered-COLE
So any money an investor gave him
after that, say a month ago --

FITZHUGH

water out of the Titnic.
That’s all Cole needs to hear.

He turns to Dev resolutely.

COLE

The doors open on Fitzhugh’s floor.

Dev looks to him.

DEV’REAUX

FITZHUGH
Oh, no, I want to see this.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Susan Braniff swigs vodka and pencils a crossword, scratching
her shitsu’s ears. Arthur Braniff pumps his legs (ankle
bracelet-clad) atop a stationary bicycle, watching TV.
SUSAN BRANIFF
Hon-eeee? What do you want
tonight? Le Bernadin takeout?
Life in prison when you’re a billionaire. Then: the door to
the elevator anteroom: POUND-POUND-POUND! Susan jolts up.
Braniff stops pedaling and, sweat-soaked, answers the door.
There stand (in order of proximity) Cole, Fitzhugh, and Dev.
Braniff detects an air of hostility.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
C’mon in, fellas.
They enter in order, Fitzhugh introducing himself.
FITZHUGH
Hi, remember me--? Chase Fitzhugh,
14E. Used to be a big fan.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
So...what brings you guys up here?
Cole knows I’m not supposed to have
visitors without supervision.
Everyone turns to Cole.

Who remains silent.

ARTHUR BRANIFF (CONT’D)
Can I fix you a drink? Some of you
look like you could use one.

Seething.

46.
DEV’REAUX
Yeah, I’ll take a -COLE
We won’t be here that long.
Braniff senses a torrent coming on.

He turns to his wife.

ARTHUR BRANIFF
Susan, why don’t you leave us for a
spell? I have a feeling Cole will
speak his mind more freely without
a lady present -COLE
I don’t give a flying fuck what I
say in front of your wife. She
lies down with a dog, she’s got
fleas, too.
Wow.

That blows everyone’s hair back a little.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
(his good humor exhausted)
Say what you’re gonna say.
COLE
You took Lester’s money.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Yes I did. He came to me, asked me
to invest it, I had no idea -COLE
It was everything he had.

Fitzhugh picks up on the emotion in Cole’s voice.
FITZHUGH
What happened to Lester?
Cole studies Braniff’s face, monitoring it as he answers:
COLE
He took an overdose of sleeping
pills this morning.
Dev and Fitzhugh both react, gut-punched. It’s harder to
tell how Braniff feels: is his concern genuine?
Ah, Jesus.

BRANIFF

47.
COLE
I got one question for you.
care?

Do you

ARTHUR BRANIFF
What do you mean, do I care -COLE
-- do you feel any responsibility,
any remorse for what happened to
Lester -ARTHUR BRANIFF
-- as I was saying, I had no idea
we were going to lose everything,
of course I feel badly -COLE
-- THEN WHY HAVEN’T YOU ASKED ME
WHETHER HE’S ALIVE OR DEAD?
Cole’s caught him.
acknowledge it.

And for a moment he detects Braniff

That does it. Cole looks around, sees what he needs, goes to
it. A fireplace poker. He snatches it up, as a weapon.
Oh my god!

SUSAN BRANIFF
I’m calling security!

COLE
I am security!
He’s off to the next room, and Dev and Fitzhugh bolt to catch
up with him. When they do, Cole is facing down --- the 1958 Austin-Healey. He steps up to the plate, draws
back the fireplace poker and WHACK! A headlight goes flying.
Braniff arrives, cringes at the destruction.
Ah, Jesus.

ARTHUR BRANIFF

COLE
Now he cares...
WHACK!

There goes the other headlight.
FITZHUGH
Cole, that’s an Austin-Healey! They
don’t make those anymore.

48.
COLE
Not like doormen. They make new
ones of those all the time.
WHACK!
COLE
And the people who PARK YOUR CARS
(whack!) and SHINE YOUR SHOES?!
I’m sure they’ll have no trouble
REPLACING (whack!) their LIFE
SAVINGS!
DEV’REAUX
(fuck it)
Shit, lemme have a swing!
Susan!!

ARTHUR BRANIFF
Call the FBI!!

COLE
Don’t bother. I’m done here.
That’s not quite true. He takes one last WHACK at the
windshield, spiderwebbing it, then tosses the fire poker
aside like he’s hit a walk-off homer.
IN THE LIVING ROOM, Susan Braniff is on the phone.
SUSAN BRANIFF
-- yes, he’s here right now.

He’s

Cole enters, finds the phone line, rips it from the wall.
COLE
I’ll send a man up in the morning
to fix that.
He exits.

Followed by Fitzhugh and Dev’reaux.
Folks.

FITZHUGH
Pleasure meeting you.

DEV’REAUX
(as he closes the door)
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Off Susan Braniff, stunned, and Arthur Braniff, pissed -DEV’REAUX (O.S.CONT’D) (CONT’D)
(through the door)
Now this is one HELL of a building!

49.
INT. PJ CLARKS -- AN HOUR LATER
Holiday revelers sing karaoke and get hammered at the bar. In
the back, Cole, Dev’reaux, Fitzhugh and Charlie huddle in a
booth; the mood here is funereal.
DEV’REAUX
How do you steal sixty billion
dollars?! I mean, nobody sit up
after the first ten billion gone
and say, whoa! Let’s change the
locks?!
FITZHUGH
The bigger the lie, the more brazen
you are telling it, the more
people’ll buy it. That’s what they
taught us at Wharton.
(to Cole)
You talk to Lester? He doing
alright?
Cole nods, lost in his thoughts.

Charlie notes his demeanor.

CHARLIE
Cole? You okay? There are other
jobs, you know.
Cole’s not listening. Charlie, Fitz and Dev exchange
glances, worried. Then:
COLE
How much you guys know about
interior design?
CHARLIE
That’s not a career for these
times! Those guys are working for
food!
COLE
Something funny about the Braniff
place. Remember they hired that
hot-shot designer..? And he ripped
everything up...?
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF PENTHOUSE -- YEARS AGO
A major redo. Hard hats tear up floors and knock down walls
as a MALE INTERIOR DESIGNER walks the job with Cole,
gesticulating at his work.

50.
COLE (V.O.)
He went around yammering about how
much he hated walls, and how
everything had to be open, open,
open...? So...
They pass a WALL in the middle of the living room.
INT. UPTOWN SALOON - CONTINUOUS
COLE
-- why’d they leave that one wall
dead in the middle of the place?
Charlie stares at Cole.
CHARLIE
You’re fired from your job in the
worst economy since the dust bowl
and that’s what’s on your mind? A
wall?
Cole doesn’t answer.
turns to Fitzhugh.

His mind is going a mile a minute.

He

COLE
Your living room has the same layout as Braniff’s, right?
(Fitz nods)
Your kids in bed yet?
FITZHUGH
(this is awkward)
They’re asleep. They’re not in
bed.
INT. THE TOWER -- FITZHUGH’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
The four men tip-toe into Fitzhugh’s apartment. It’s dark
but everyone can see: what used to be a cozily-appointed home
is now nearly empty, almost totally bereft of furniture.
FITZHUGH
The mortgage obviously came
first... we had to downscale...
(despite his brave face,
he’s torn up over this)
I think my wife’s hiding back
there... she’ll be embarrassed I’ve
got people over. Doesn’t want you
to see the sleeping bags... I’m
just gonna kiss them goodnight...

51.
He goes. Cole moves to the wall matching the one in
Braniff’s place. He starts tapping along it.
CHARLIE
Cole, what are you doing?
COLE
Checking if this wall is loadbearing.
CHARLIE
I know, I mean: what are you doing
checking if it’s load-bearing?
Clunk.

A hollow sound.

Cole taps all around it.

Smiles.

DEV’REAUX
What’d you find?
COLE
Space. Braniff knocked down every
unnecessary wall but this one. Why
do you think he did that?
Charlie moves close enough to Cole to whisper:
CHARLIE
Would you tell me what’s going
through your head?
No.

COLE

INT. THE TOWER -- COLE’S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Cole goes through old records in the middle of the night.
Finds the file he’s looking for, withdraws it.
EXT. GRAND ARMY PLAZA -- CHRISTMAS DAY
The square is awash with New Yorkers and tourists alike,
bundled up in holiday garb. Cole stands waiting by Pulitzer
Fountain. Then, across the square -- -- Jillian Denham
arrives. In civilian clothes and all the more attractive for
it, so we will now refer to her as JILLIAN.
JILLIAN
Merry Christmas.
COLE
Thank you for meeting me. I hope I
didn’t take you away from anything.

52.
JILLIAN
Nothing I’d want a second date
with. You?
COLE
Just a houseguest.
JILLIAN
We heard. Lester feeling better?
(Cole nods)
We also heard about your run-in
with Braniff. You know, you
violated three federal laws by
going up there.
(beat)
Because of that, a lot of people
down at the bureau want to buy you
a drink.
COLE
Does that include you?
She smiles.
INT.

ELAINE’S - NIGHT

Jillian and Cole are midway through a couple of martinis,
which are tasting very, very good about now. The paper with
the layout of Braniff’s penthouse is rolled out in front of
them.
JILLIAN
You really think the 20 million is
here?
COLE
There’s no other place it could be.
They knocked down every non-loadbearing wall in the place except
one.
(withdraws more evidence,
a Tower sign-in sheet)
Here -- see? A delivery and
installation to Braniff’s penthouse
from an “H&J Security.” They sell
and install safes.
(taps the layout wall)
I think there’s a safe in this
wall. Like you said: if you had
that much money, you’d keep it
close.
She scours the layout, intrigued.

Then, looks away.

53.

Shit.

JILLIAN

COLE
No, look, I think it’s there-JILLIAN
No -- I bet you’re right.
COLE
Then why “shit?”
JILLIAN
(hands the layout back)
You never showed me this.
What?

COLE

JILLIAN
I didn’t hear any of this.
Cole studies her now: is she joking?

No.

JILLIAN (CONT’D)
Word came down yesterday. The
bureau is officially hands-off as
far as Arthur Braniff is concerned.
COLE
(aghast)
What do you mean “hands off”?
You’re not going to prosecute?
JILLIAN
No, it’s too public to do nothing,
but... they’ll make a deal, he’ll
give up a few cohorts and they’ll
all do a little time. Not hard
time mind you, a year maybe in a
club fed.
COLE
After everything he’s done? Who in
the hell would want to protect
that-JILLIAN
We think Braniff has files on
people, some very rich, very
powerful people. We have strict
orders: Do-Not-Touch.

54.
JILLIAN (CONT'D)
So whether it’s in a safe in that
wall or in a helium balloon over
Tribecca, he’s gonna walk away from
all this with a twenty million
dollar parachute.
COLE
You’re kidding me.
JILLIAN
I was funny once.

Want another one?
COLE
I, ah, I never have seconds.
JILLIAN
Moderation in all things.

Probably

Cole plays with his swizzle stick for a moment, then suddenly
slaps his palm down on the bar.
COLE
And look where it’s gotten me!
Grade-grubbing, student loans,
trainee programs, years and years,
every i dotted, every t crossed,
every form filled out, punctual,
loyal, crossing on green, waiting
on red, inching my way up bit by
bit, grovel by grovel, to some kind
of white collar “security” that’s
never secure... because I’m not
one of them!!
A beat.
JILLIAN
Yeah. The rich are very, very
clubby. They look out for each
other. And no one else.
COLE
They don’t know us, they don’t see
us, they don’t think about us -His head comes up.

Suddenly, under his breath:

COLE (CONT’D)
They’d never see us coming.

55.
JILLIAN
Oh, no, no, no, whatever you just
said, I did not hear.
COLE
Oh, but you know what I-She covers her ears like a child:
JILLIAN
La la la! I can’t hear you! I
can’t hear you! La la la la!
She shoots him a sly look, though.

He laughs.

COLE
And I thought I wasn’t going to
like you for not hearing things.
She smiles at him.

Cole pays the check.

COLE (CONT’D)
Well... it’s been eye-opening.
They get up off their stools, friends now.

He’s still

COLE (CONT’D)
Too bad I’m banned from the

JILLIAN
I’m sure Mr. Simon felt that way.
Until he started thinking about
finding someone who knows every
inch of that building from the
tiniest crack in the mortar to the
steel in the beams, the name of
every resident, who keeps his mouth
shut about where the bodies are
buried, doesn’t complain, moves
like lightening and makes everyone
around him look good -- ONE DAY

He hadn’t thought about it in exactly that

INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- MONDAY MORNING
Arthur Braniff pours coffee from a sterling silver pot and
offers it to Cole, who declines.

56.
Braniff offers it instead to Mr. Simon, who receives it
gladly. They sit around Braniff’s dining room, a picture of
civility.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Nothing for you, Cole? Water?
Cole demurs.
MR. SIMON
Mr. Braniff, let me say how
gracious you’ve been in all this.
What happened over the holiday,
what Mr. Howard did coming up here,
was wholly inexcusable.
It’s a testament to your
generosity, sir, that he is allowed
on the premises.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
It’s a trying time for everyone. I
don’t blame anybody for losing
their cool given what they’ve been
hearing in the press. And Mr.
Howard’s too valuable an asset to
the building to lose over a silly
flare-up. I’m sure he regrets what
he did.
Braniff smiles at Cole, which nearly sets him off.
Cole’s keeping his cool.

But today

MR. SIMON
Mr. Howard volunteered to come here
this morning to apologize, in the
hopes we might put this unseemly
incident behind us. Mr. Howard?
Everyone faces Cole. Braniff. Mrs. Braniff, standing
guardedly in a doorway. Even Jillian, here to monitor the
visit. Cole chooses his words carefully.
COLE
Mr. Braniff, I deeply regret what
transpired between us last week. If
I could go back, I’d behave much
differently. Please know that my
estimation of your character hasn’t
wavered a bit throughout this
ordeal, and that today I hold you
in the same respect I always have.
To Mr. Simon’s ears this sounds like the proper kowtowing.
But Braniff knows: Cole is saying go-fuck-yourself.

57.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
And let me say that I know your
job’s tough. I mean, resentments
are bound to bubble up when you
feel sometimes like a... a
glorified servant.
He says this affably, but it is giant FUCK YOU back to Cole.
MR. SIMON
As for Mr. Braniff’s automobile?
Cole’s eyes briefly flit to “The Wall,” then back to Braniff.
He’s made his decision.
COLE
Sir, I will pay you back for all
the damage that’s been done.
And Braniff knows what Cole means: I’m coming for you.

The hands belong to SLIDE LINDUS.

Cole’s childhood friend.

SLIDE
Open says me.
The safe complies. The Manager pushes Slide aside to get
inside the safe but first Slide plucks up a band of cash from
within. The Manager protests in Cantonese but...

about paying me in merchandise. You

to the ID and picks up)
Old King Cole, you merry old soul,
why are you admitting you know me?
EXT. UNION SQUARE COFFEE SHOP -- DAY
Slide enters the restaurant, approaches Cole in a booth near
a window.
COLE
Promise you won’t laugh.
EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- DAY
FROM A DISTANCE AWAY: Cole and Slide bestride the sidewalk,
Cole doing the talking, Slide the listening. Then, about
halfway down the block, Slide stops in his tracks and stares
at Cole. We can’t hear what he says but we can imagine. Cole
smiles and insists: no, he’s not fucking with him.
A BLOCK AWAY AND WE’RE HIGH ABOVE THE STREET NOW as Cole and
Slide round a corner. Cole points up and Slide looks.
REVERSE: LOOKING PAST COLE AND SLIDE, UP AT THE TOWER,
specifically the penthouse. Slide looks upon it the way some
men look upon Everest, with ambition and abject terror.
And thus begins a RECRUITMENT MONTAGE -EXT. MCCARREN PARK -- BROOKLYN -- DAY

aware of a PRESENCE walking behind him. Flicking a glance
backwards, he sees a GUY with A BASEBALL BAT. Heart
pounding, he picks up speed, afraid to break out into a dead
run, but veering off the path to the left.
The guy keeps walking. Then approaches HIS 10 YEAR OLD KID,
tousles his hair and hands him the bat, pulling out a
SOFTBALL. Just a Dad and son, playing ball.
Dev exhales. Then stiffens, sensing more presences.

when you’re awake.”
DEV’REAUX

Okay. I made a few... optimistic

ON THE WHEELS OF A BABY STROLLER rolling along... pushed by
Fitzhugh, spending an afternoon comparing pathetically ultralow prices on hideous canned meat. Cole falls in alongside
him.

Spam?
FITZHUGH

You know, there are some people who
actually like Spam.

You’re not one of them.

Cole loads a misty-eyed Lester into a taxi.
LESTER
Mr. Howard, I don’t know how to...

Sh-sh.

COLE
No need, Lester.

LESTER
(as they shake)
Thank you... Cole.
Lester gets in; the cab goes. Cole looks up. Sprinkled
around the block, waiting, are Charlie, Slide, Dev’reaux and
Fitzhugh. Cole gives the signal: coast’s clear, c’mon in.
INT. COLE’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Our five guys sit around a fold-out card table. Cole has
just laid out, with Slide’s help, “the plan.” The others sit
stunned into silence by the audacity of it. After a spell,
Charlie leans forward and speaks. Very, very slowly.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Good, good thinking. Let’s
just rob the penthouse apartment of
the building we work in -- with the
tenant still inside -- with FBI
agents STATIONED OUTSIDE THE FRONT
DOOR, WITH security cameras -- to
steal twenty million that MIGHT be
in there -- IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR
SHIFT?!
There’s no mistaking Charlie’s tone for enthusiasm.
COLE
It’s a little frisky, I admit.
CHARLIE
Why don’t I just pull out a bomb on
an airplane? Same odds of getting
away!
COLE
What do you think, Fitz?
FITZHUGH
Can you come back to me?
COLE
You said it: if you’re gonna
steal, steal big.

Listen, I am beyond comfortable

the truth)
Well -- aiding and abetting.

Okay, but how do we control the

us.
Slide looks from man to man to man, amused: this is who he’s
working with. Then, he crosses to the refrigerator box -SLIDE

Looming high above the parade -- lest we forget how very,

Does Grandma have ice cream?
FITZHUGH
(mortified)
Yes. Because Grandma has a
freezer.
Fitzhugh watches them to the elevator and Mrs. Fitzhugh blows
him a kiss before she disappears. Fitz catches it, scared.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- DAY
Charlie organizes the front desk. As far as he knows, it’s
just another day. Until he eyes Cole and Dev exit the back
halls together and his antennae go up. Maybe it’s the
conspiratorial way Cole sends Dev off on an errand.
As Cole passes by, they trade nods: in the weeks since
Charlie bowed out, a chilly distance has grown between them.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Susan Braniff dresses in her massive walk-in closet with
floor-to-ceiling shoe shelves as her husband sits atop their
bed talking on his cell.

INT.

MISS HOLLINGSWORTH’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The stringy, Miss Hollingsworth gestures contemptuously at
OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH in a wheelchair -- Brooke Astor
incarnate. In front of the aged lady is a tray with Jell-o
and on the tray, SEVERAL PILLS.
MISS HOLLINGSWORTH
Now, she gets very agitated -- I
need you to help me hold her while
you give her the pills.

68.
The CAMERA turns around. And we see that the ATTENDANT
helping her... is DEV’REAUX.
DEV’REAUX
Yes, yes... they explained it all
to me, ma’am. At your service.
As they approach the old lady, she moans and shrinks in
terror. Dev can’t help but notice:
DEV’REAUX (CONT’D)
She really don’t like ‘em, does
she?
MISS HOLLINGSWORTH
It’s total dementia. She doesn’t
know what’s best for her.
DEV’REAUX
Yes, ma’am.
As Miss Hollingsworth holds her mother, Dev’reaux RAISES THE
PILLS to the woman’s lips...
...then PALMS THEM.
Is that a flicker of appreciation in the old woman’s eyes?
We’re not sure.
INT. THE TOWER -- FITZHUGH’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
The place is nearly empty now. A sofa, a cabinet, little
else left. Fitz sits, eyes closed, when RIINNG.

FITZHUGH
Hello. Sorry, we met around

SUSAN BRANIFF
(an unpleasant memory)
I remember.

DING!

Fitzhugh

The doors close.
FITZHUGH
(making conversation)
Off to lunch?
SUSAN BRANIFF
My friends tell me it’s unwise to
be seen eating out these days. They
mean it’s unwise for them to be
seen eating out with me these days.
Fitzhugh feigns empathy.
FITZHUGH
How awful! You did nothing wrong.
(spots the theater tix)
Ah, you have tickets for a matinee.
What show?
SUSAN BRANIFF
These? Someone dropped them off
yesterday, someone I obviously
don’t know, because I despise
Shakespeare.
FITZHUGH
(through clenched teeth)
Just a mass of cliches, isn’t he?
Nodding in agreement, she RIPS THE TICKETS IN HALF, tosses
them. Fitzhugh sighs. Strike one.
DING!

They exit.

INT. THE TOWER -- STAFF KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
Cole withdraws a cake from a hiding place. Sets it alongside
a cake knife, plastic forks, paper plates, etc.. Licks
frosting off his hand -MS. DOLOWITZ
Mr. Howard, you wanted to see me?
COLE
Yes, Ms. Dolowitz. Would you
assemble the maid staff in the
package room please?

Now?

MS. DOLOWITZ
(nervous)

70.
COLE
No job cuts. Don’t worry.
(she moves to use her mic)
Radio silence if you would.
Ms. Dolowitz thinks it odd but obeys. As she goes, Dev
arrives in the doorway. He nods: mission accomplished.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY
Charlie tracks Mrs. B and Fitz out the elevator door and
across the lobby as Cole appears.
COLE
Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Svichkar, may I see
you both in the package room?
CHARLIE
(on guard, resistant)
Who’ll watch the desk?
COLE
Mr. Dev’reaux can.
(fuck)
Certainly.

CHARLIE

Dev comes around to man the front desk. Svichkar heads into
the package room and Charlie follows him, reluctantly.
EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- DAY
Susan Braniff exits the Tower, followed by Fitzhugh.
FITZHUGH
Thanks, Lester.
(to Mrs. B)
Beautiful day. You know what I
love to do on days like today? Take
the ferry to Staten Island. Out on
the water, feel the breeze, drink a
little chablis...
SUSAN BRANIFF
(a brushback)
Then I think you should go do that.
Good afternoon, Mr. Fetzer.
She goes.

Foiled, Fitz gives her a moment, then tails her.

71.
INT. THE TOWER -- PACKAGE ROOM -- DAY
Charlie joins Washington, Dolowitz, the maids and other staff
here. Cole signals them to enter quietly.
CHARLIE
Cole, what are you -COLE
Sh-sh-sh.
(then, in a stern voice)
Ms. Perez, a word with you.
Perez’s had her nose in the mail until now; she looks up,
surprised to find so many people in her workspace.
COLE (CONT’D)
Ms. Perez, your job here is to
monitor the delivery of incoming
and outgoing mail. And yet the
most important letter this building
may receive all year slipped your
attention.
(withdraws an envelope)
From the ”American Bar
Association?”
She swallows hard as he hands over the letter. Everyone in
the room looks hopeful for her. She opens it, starts to
read...and her eyes well up.
PEREZ
I passed!
(everybody cheers)
How did you know?! I might’ve
flunked!
COLE
I know exactly how much time you
had to study. Congrats, counselor.
Cole reveals the cake from the kitchen. As Perez cuts the
first slice, Cole glances at Charlie, who feels foolish for
being so paranoid. However -INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
-- at the front desk, Dev has seized the moment to dismantle
the front desk switchboard and detach Braniff’s phone line.
COLE (O.S.)
Mr. Dev’reaux, piece of cake?

72.
DEV’REAUX
You betcha.
As Dev’reaux reaches for his slice his hand brushes against
Cole’s, and COLE PALMS SOMETHING out of Dev’s hand.
One guess what.
EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- DAY
Mrs. Braniff navigates a path through the St. Patty’s Day
revelers. Not far behind Fitzhugh keeps an inconspicuous
tail. She diverts onto a side street and he mirrors her.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- DAY
A DELIVERY GUY from the neighborhood deli enters.
Charlie, back at his post --

He salutes

DELIVERY GUY
Lunch for Rapunzel.
-- and Charlie waves him on through.
with two slices of cake in hand.

Just then Cole emerges

COLE
Just a sec. Do me a favor and take
these up to Mr. and Mrs. Braniff?
We’re all pretty torn up that
they’re unjustly imprisoned this
way and can’t be part of our
celebration, and they do love
German chocolate cake...
(the Delivery Guy glares
at him: you kidding?)
I know, “do it yourself,” but see,
the FBI draws guns when there’s
extra people up there... Here, let
me take these and you take these...
And before the Delivery Guy can protest, Cole’s taken his
delivery pouch from him and loaded him with two plates of
cake, forks, napkins, etc. Charlie knows something is up.
Got ‘em?

COLE (CONT’D)
Great. Thanks.

DELIVERY GUY
(under his breath)
Next time wait on the prick
yourself.

73.
Charlie’s antennae are up again. He turns to see: the entire
Tower staff is eating cake. Uh-oh. He sets down his slice.
EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- DAY
A SQUADRON OF MOUNTED COPS pass by, on parade.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Braniff watches the parade from his window, on the phone.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
No -- wait -- no -- THURSDAY? I
want to be out of here MONDAY -I’ve got a villa reserved in Como-OK, OK, yeah. If you can get that,
close it. Let’s make the deal and
be done with it.

KNOCK at the door)
Yeah?

Lunch is here.
EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- DAY
ON A PAIR OF FLORSHEIM WINGTIPS CLICKING ALONG THE SIDEWALK.
They belong to a man in a Brooks Brothers suit, bespectacled,
carrying a briefcase. He approaches the Tower.
LESTER
May I help you, sir?
SLIDE
(a mid-Atlantic accent)
Yes, I’m here to see an apartment.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- DAY
The Delivery Guy places sandwiches on Braniff’s dining table.
And the TWO SLICES OF CAKE.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
(re: the cake)
What’s this shit?
DELIVERY GUY
They gamme it downstairs, some guy.
Braniff eyes the cake, uneasy.

74.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
(suspicious)
Not the manager?
Maybe.

DELIVERY GUY

ARTHUR BRANIFF
Was he supercilious?
DELIVERY GUY
--Expi-alidocious!
The delivery guy gives him a fuck-you grin. Braniff scowls,
pays the guy. And pointedly gives him a ONE CENT tip. When
the delivery guy and Cunningham are gone, Braniff takes his
food straight to the kitchen --- and dumps the cake in the trash. He’s not taking any
chances if it was sent up by Cole. Then: he unwraps his
corned beef sandwich and takes a bite.
INT. THE TOWER -- COLE’S OFFICE -- DAY
Cole bites into an identical corned beef sandwich.

Charlie

COLE
Dijon?! How ivory tower, Dijon on
corned beef...!
CHARLIE
If that was Braniff’s, you sure
they all obeyed your order about
not spitting in it?
COLE
They always obey my...
He thinks.

Hm.

He drops the sandwich in the trash.

CHARLIE
Stop this. Now. So far the worst
you’ve done is, what, drug the man?
COLE
That is a horrible accusation.
He ain’t sayin’ a thing.
CHARLIE
He can still just wake up, never
know what happened. If you keep
going with this...

75.
COLE
What, Charlie? You’ll call the
cops on me? After all the years
we’ve worked side by side?
CHARLIE
Don’t make me choose.
We see, on his desk, PICTURES of Charlie with a WIFE and
KIDS. Also children’s DRAWINGS -- Fathers Day Cards. Cole
sees what Charlie has to lose. He nods.
Over both their walkies:
SVICHKAR’S VOICE
Mr. Howard, I have a Mr. Bissell
here to see you.
Cole starts out.

Charlie shoots him a look -- don’t!

Cole measures him, goes anyway.
INT. CHOPSTIX NAIL SALON -- MIDTOWN -- DAY
Korean manicurists start in on Mrs. Braniff’s hands and feet;
she lies back, towel over her eyes, indulged to the max.
Fitzhugh monitors from across the street, checks his watch.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- DAY
Slide, in costume, speaks to Svichkar at the front desk.
SLIDE
-- I spoke to Mr. Fitzhugh himself
and he assured me it was fine.
SVICHKAR
We still have to follow protocol.
(Cole arrives)
Mr. Howard, this is Mr. Bissell. He
was hoping to view the Fitzhugh
property but they’re not at home.
COLE
Not a problem.

I’ll show you up.

Emerging behind Cole, Charlie takes one look at Slide in his
pinstripe suit and can’t contain himself.
CHARLIE
Oh, c’mon, you gotta be, you can’t
expect anyone’ll believe this...

76.
SVICHKAR
Mr. Howard, we don’t have clearance
from the Fitzhughs.
COLE
That’s okay, Mr. Svichkar. Come,
Mr. Bissell, elevators’re this way.
Charlie spots Mr. Simon entering the lobby and recognizes his
chance to safely sabotage Cole’s heist.
CHARLIE
(too loudly)
Are you forgetting that we need
written consent from an owner
before admitting any visitor into
their unit?
(Cole keeps moving)
Isn’t that right, Mr. Simon?!
MR. SIMON
(finally paying notice)
Is there a problem, Mr. Howard?
Cole stops, shoots Charlie a look: well played.

Then:

COLE
I have the situation under control,
Mr. Simon.
MR. SIMON
What situation?
CHARLIE
This gentleman is here to see the
Fitzhugh apartment. Unfortunately
we have no written consent from
them.
MR. SIMON
Then there’s no issue.

Advantage: Charlie.

He can’t go

Cole’s stymied.

He’s rescued by --

SLIDE
Perhaps I can shed some light,
Mister...?
MR. SIMON
Simon, Tower property manager.

77.
SLIDE
Morris Bissell, Liberty Mutual. My
bank handles the Fitzhugh mortgage.
MR. SIMON
Don’t you mean “handled?”
He snickers at his own (unfunny) joke. Slide draws Mr. Simon
aside, for discretion’s sake. Meanwhile, Mr. Lindus
approaches/distracts Charlie.
LINDUS
...why are all these people
outside?...
SLIDE
Recently we were forced to
foreclose on the Fitzhughs, sadly.
We allowed them a thirty-day grace
period to move but technically the
bank is now tenant of record so...
MR. SIMON
Sorry, your name again was...?
SLIDE
Morris Bissell.
He withdraws a business card, hands it to Simon. It reads:
“Morris Bissell, Liberty Mutual.” Simon turns to Cole:
MR. SIMON
Take him on up. Sorry for the
confusion, Mr. Bissell.
Now it’s Charlie who’s stymied. As Cole and Slide continue
to the elevators, under their breaths:
COLE
Where’d you get the business card?
SLIDE
Some dude’s wallet I... found.
Your buddy gonna be cool?
Cole shoots Charlie a look as he boards the elevator and
Slide sets a finger to his lips just as its doors close.
Charlie, incensed, grabs the phone at the front desk.
starts to dial, then hesitates.
SVICHKAR
Who you calling?

He

CHARLIE

Cole was right; he can’t
turn them in)
Shit!
MUSIC PUMPS UP as the heist kicks into higher gear and -EXT. THE TOWER -- ROOF -- DAY
-- COLE AND SLIDE EMERGE FROM A DOORWAY AND STEP OUT INTO A
THREE-SIXTY VIEW OF THE CITY SURROUNDING THEM.
Dev’reaux is already here, supplies in hand. He tosses each
man a white jumpsuit and gloves, then proceeds to remove the
tarp from a WINDOW-WASHING PLATFORM stored at the roof edge.
MOMENTS LATER, Cole and Slide, wearing their jumpsuits over
their suits, help Dev hoist the platform over the side of the
building and into position.
Slide peers over the side: it’s a heart-stopping, vertiginous
view. Cole appears beside him.
SLIDE
You ever done this before?
COLE
I get dizzy stepping off the curb.
(cell buzzes; he picks up)
Mr. Fitzhugh, how are we?
EXT. CHOPSTIX NAIL SALON -- MIDTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
Fitzhugh continues to watch Susan Braniff’s nails get done.
FITZHUGH
They’ve finished moisturizing her
feet and‘re about to start buffing.
COLE
Do you have a plan?
FITZHUGH
I’m... pondering.
From a newsstand he plucks up a magazine promoting an article
“Inside The Braniff Swindle.”
EXT. THE TOWER -- ROOF -- CONTINUOUS
Cole hangs up, dials a new number. Meanwhile, Slide tests
the platform cables’ strength. To Dev:

SLIDE
How much weight can this baby bear?
Dev has only his elevator operator experience to guide him.
DEV’REAUX
I push the buttons! Do I look like

Braniff is nowhere

EXT. THE TOWER -- ROOF -- CONTINUOUS
Cole hangs up.
No answer.

COLE
Whatya think?

SLIDE
We got two hours.

Tops.

As good a final thought as any.

Over the side they go.

A WIDE VIEW of the Tower, Central Park beyond it, the parade
on the street below and on top our two faux window-washers
climbing out onto a two-foot wide, ten-foot long apparatus.
Dev hands Slide his banker’s briefcase as he gives Cole a
quick tutorial.
DEV’REAUX
This is your ‘up’ button, this is
your ‘down.’ This locks it in
place. Run into any trouble, this
might be manual override I got up
here. Might not.
SLIDE
You got my back.

Nice to know.

Cole lowers them from view.
INT. CHOPSTIX NAIL SALON -- MIDTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
Fitzhugh enters, approaches the young female PROPRIETOR at
the front, careful not to be seen by Mrs. Braniff within.
FITZHUGH
Hi... Speak English?

he opens his magazine)
Know who this is?

FITZHUGH (CONT'D)
(he points out Braniff;
(she nods/scowls)
Good. This is his wife.
He points from a picture of Mrs. Braniff to the real deal,
currently being waited on by a trio of manicurists. The
Proprietor doesn’t like this one bit.
PROPRIETOR
(her English is better
than she let on)
That bitch is in my shop?
Fitz takes out a pair of $100’s.
FITZHUGH
Need you to do me a favor.
EXT. THE TOWER -- ROOF/SIDE -- CONTINUOUS
ABOARD THE PLATFORM WITH COLE AND SLIDE, more than anything
else it’s claustrophobic up here: there’s no place to go,
barely any place to step. Both Cole and Slide can’t help
looking at the drop as they descend.
SLIDE
Aren’t we not supposed to look
down?
COLE
I remember that now. --My God!!
(re: a streaked window
pane)
I’ve been paying these window
washers, and THIS is the service
they-- these people are criminals!!
SLIDE
You the criminal!!
COLE
(nonplussed)
No! I’m...
SLIDE
You just “frisky.”
FROM WITHIN THE PENTHOUSE: The window-washer apparatus lowers
into view. Still no sign of Braniff inside. Cole stops
their descent when they’re flush with the apartment.
OUTSIDE: Slide opens up his briefcase. Inside is the very
latest in fiberglass-cutting technology: a suction-clamp with
an extendable arm attached to a blade.

81.
Slide affixes it to the window and prepares to cut.
to Cole, who dials Braniff’s cell again.
INSIDE: Braniff’s cell RINGS.

He looks

Unanswered.

OUTSIDE: Cole nods to Slide: do it.

Slide begins to cut.

INSIDE: While it’s not exactly noisy, the bladework’s loud
enough to draw attention from anyone inside the apartment.
ON THE ROOF, Dev watches from above.

Over his walkie:

WASHINGTON’S VOICE
Mr. Dev’reaux, what’s your twenty?
DEV’REAUX
I’m, um, in the building -- why?
WASHINGTON’S VOICE
Mr. Svichkar’s taking his break,
need you to come cover for him.
DEV’REAUX
Why, certainly. On my way.
He mouths:

FU-UCK!

He doesn’t move.

A FLOOR BELOW: Slide finishes slicing a four-foot circle out
of the window. Then, with a practiced push, he thrusts the
entire piece of fiberglass into the penthouse without
dropping it, then lays it softly on the floor.
SLIDE
Now this I’ve done.
A pro at this, Slide lifts one leg out of the apparatus,
straddling its rail, then dips his foot inside the four-foot
hole. When his foot’s flat on the floor, he pulls himself
over and inside the apartment, ducking his head as he goes.
Now it’s Cole’s turn. Not a pro. He tries to mimic Slide’s
method but once he’s got a foot inside the penthouse --- a sharp wind picks up and banks off the edifice, pushing
the apparatus out. Just as Cole begins to flounder, Slide
reaches out and grabs him and pulls him in.
They’ve breached the penthouse.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
The two men stand absolutely still, panting, listening.
to verify if Braniff’s actually asleep.

82.
First things first, though. Cole tip-toes to the front door
leading to the elevator anteroom and -- ever so slowly -bolts it.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR: Agent Cunningham, wrapped up
in a magazine, doesn’t hear a thing.
BACK IN THE PENTHOUSE: Cole signals Slide: you check that
way, I’ll go this way. Slide, who’s never stepped foot
inside such a decadent living space (much less b&e’d one)
takes it all in. He pretends to be blase:
SLIDE
North facing windows. You call
that natural light? For 50
million, you should get two
exposures at least!

Done with her pedicure, Mrs. Braniff rises from her chair.
She rudely waves off the help of those who’ve labored over
her the past hour, then:

Cole corrals the shitsus into Mrs. Braniff’s shoe-filled walkin and shuts the door. Slide, meanwhile, conducts a search
for Braniff. He ducks his head into a DEN, sees nothing,
starts to go when SNORING draws him back.

83.
Braniff has fallen off a couch and lies asleep on the floor,
sandwich wrapper at his side.
SLIDE
This the mofo?
Cole appears to confirm it is.
MOMENTS LATER, PULLING BACK FROM THE WALL as Cole and Slide
move furniture and lamps away from it.
Slide starts tapping along its surface, strikes something
unforgiving and follows its perimeter. Then, withdrawing a
chisel, he prepares to drive it into the surface but --- Cole stops him first. Concerned the noise might alert the
Sentry outside. He looks about, finds a universal remote on a
coffee table and punches in a selection.
The voice of Barry Manilow suddenly fills the penthouse.
“...oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking...”
Slide scowls at him. Cole gestures: not my playlist. Slide
resumes his work, burying the chisel into the drywall.
IN THE ANTEROOM: Agent Cunningham shakes his head at
Braniff’s choice in music, flips the page on his magazine.
“...but I sent you away, oh Mandy...”
INT. CHOPSTIX NAIL SALON -- MIDTOWN -- DAY
Mrs. Braniff is apoplectic, ranting.
SUSAN BRANIFF
How. Can you possibly. Have lost.

fact that they should be in the

Susan Braniff, apoplectic, storms out the door, only to be
met by --

EXT. CHOPSTIX NAIL SALON -- CONTINUOUS
-- a WALL OF PAPARAZZI, flashing/clicking away at Public
Enemy #1’s wife in bare feet. Mrs. Braniff is mortified.
She tries to cover her face, trudging forward, tip-toeing
through midtown trash, barraged at every angle by blinding
flashbulbs. It’s almost possible to feel sorry for her.
Then, hero to the rescue, Fitzhugh steps forth.
FITZHUGH
Mrs. Braniff, you alright?
SUSAN BRANIFF
Oh, it’s you... Fisticuffs...
FITZHUGH
Whatever. Here, let me help.
(to the paparazzi)
Please, gentlemen, have some
dignity.
He guides her to the street, still swarmed by photographers,
then into the back seat of a cab.
SUSAN BRANIFF
Thank you so much, Mister, uh... I
keep losing it.

No, no, no. They’re there, too.

Someone you can stay with until I
can douse these prurient flames?
SUSAN BRANIFF
A sister in Greenwich.
FITZHUGH
Go there. I’ll have the building
call you when it’s safe.

Fitzhugh watches it go, then turns to them.

Cole grabs the case and Slide removes the tools of his trade.

Fitzhugh returns to the Tower. He looks up to the platform
high above. Boy is he glad that’s not his part of the heist.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER
Fitz heads straight for the elevators.

Mr. Simon approaches.

FITZHUGH

difficulties. If there’s anything
we can do to assist you -FITZHUGH
-- oh, no, no thanks --

MR. SIMON

company for the weekend?
That stops him. Mr. Simon’s giving him an eviction notice.
Fitz’d like to slap the needlehead’s face.

He goes. Meanwhile, Charlie gets an idea, picks up the

INT.

JILLIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It looks a lot like Cole’s. The home of a single person
who’s never home, sparsely furnished. She’s even eating Kung
Pao chicken out of a container, just like Cole did earlier.
JILLIAN
Hi, ah... this is...
COLE

Jillian?

JILLIAN
Good guess.

Uh, yeah.
What’s up?

COLE

It is very disconcerting for him to be talking to an FBI
agent while watching his buddy crack a safe.
JILLIAN
This is a personal-slashprofessional call.
Oh. Oh.
hope.

COLE
I -- that’s nice.

Well, yes.
An awkward pause.

I

JILLIAN
I hope too.

And she’s not usually awkward.

JILLIAN (CONT’D)
I, ah, just wanted to mention that
there was, in our last meeting, a
path you were considering going
down... and I just wanted to warn
you that if you were to go down
that path... none of which did I
suspect for a moment...
Damn!

SLIDE

He’s fumbled a combination.
What--

He tries again.

JILLIAN

COLE
Lobby commotion.

Go on, go on...

88.
JILLIAN
Um. Right. Path. Okay. If you
were to, um, in any way pursue some
illegal recourse against Mr.
Braniff... not only would I be
obligated to take you in...
COLE
Presuming you were to find out.
JILLIAN
Which I probably would, because I
have the radar of... a witch.
COLE
That’s a harsh way to put it.
JILLIAN
It’s a phrase coined by my ex
husband.
COLE
Then he was cheating on you.
JILLIAN
(smiles)
Still.
COLE
Get back to, if you had to take me
in...
JILLIAN
Right. If you were to go to prison
for some... protracted period... we
would, ah...
Cole is dying to know where this is going.
COLE
We would what?
JILLIAN
(sighs, gives it up)
...never, ah, have a second date.
Cole beams. Did he just hear what he thought he heard? That
this intelligent and attractive woman is INTERESTED in him?!
Fuck me!
Knox!!!

SLIDE
This motherfucker’s Fort

89.
Cole cringes and scuttles to the far end of the room, waving
at Slide to shut up.
COLE
I would really not like anything...
to get in the way of that.
JILLIAN
(pleased)
Really?
Slide GETS THE SAFE OPEN.

Cole doesn’t notice.

COLE
(firmly)
Oh yeah. But, ah, that wasn’t much
of a date, was it?
JILLIAN
(blushing)
Well, you paid...
COLE
I should have had that second
drink.
You think?

JILLIAN

Slide is waving at Cole.

Cole doesn’t notice.

COLE
I just... I don’t know, it’s been
so long since I’ve really relaxed
with someone...
Slide THROWS A PILLOW at Cole’s head.
SAFE starting to OPEN...!
Gotta go.

COLE (CONT’D)
Work. Work.

Oh.

JILLIAN
I hope--

Sure.

Cole finally sees THE

It’s work--

CLICK! He’s gone. She’s left staring at the receiver, not
sure what happened.
Back in the Braniff apartment, Cole and Slide are staring at
the safe. Their faces fall.
Because the safe is dead empty.

90.
SLIDE
Now this is a disappointment.
Cole stares in disbelief. He steps forward to feel inside
the safe, for a trap door, anything. All he finds is a CDROM lying on its floor.
SLIDE (CONT’D)
Well, we got us some Barry.
INT. THE TOWER -- PENTHOUSE ANTEROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Where the Sentry finishes one magazine, moves onto the next.
DING! Someone’s arriving via elevator. It’s Charlie. He’s
elated/relieved to see the Sentry awake.
CHARLIE
Hey, how ya doin’?
AGENT CUNNINGHAM
Okay, thanks.
(pointedly)
How can I help you?
Charlie looks to the door to the penthouse, shut.
what’s going on in there?

Wonders

CHARLIE
Oh, I just came up to see if
everything’s alright up here.
AGENT CUNNINGHAM
Because the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is inept?
CHARLIE
Well, the whole Kennedy thing was
kind of a debac-A stony stare from Cunningham.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Nonono, you guys are
great...just... wanted to know if
you need anything-AGENT CUNNINGHAM
--that several thousand takeout
menus can’t provide?
There are, indeed, 10 dead rainforests’ worth of takeout
menus stacked to the ceiling. Charlie’s not getting
anywhere. He keeps looking at the door: what to do?

91.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Cole and Slide continue to weigh their options.
COLE
Maybe...maybe...
(re: the disc)
...maybe this is something, I don’t
know, something that-SLIDE
--has twenty million dollars hidden
in it? Shrunk down by some ol’
“miniaturization” machine!
COLE
We have to at least look at this.
SLIDE
(annoyed)
It’s probly some DVD of some fourway with some other old, ugly-ass
couple?
COLE
(tapping his forehead)
I don’t need those images right nowSLIDE
Rich folks like to keep shit like
that in their safe. You know,
“savor the moment,” for later.
COLE
Ewwww, just -- would you STOP!
With Slide, and only Slide, Cole reverts to age 13.
INT. THE TOWER -- PENTHOUSE ANTEROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Charlie’s still working on Cunningham.
CHARLIE
Awful quiet in there.

Right.

CHARLIE

INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Cole, meanwhile, is succumbing to the reality that this was a
huge folly. He’s pissed at himself.
COLE
I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry I
dragged you guys into this--!
Meanwhile, Slide roams the apartment, looking for things to
steal. He eyes the wine refrigerator.
SLIDE
Well, we gotta cut some losses.
They’s some pretty fine reds in
there-No!

COLE
No no, I’m not a common thief!

SLIDE
Oh, hey, then, what are you?
special thief?
I--

A

COLE

SLIDE
A “frisky” thief?
COLE
Just... let it go.
SLIDE
Is you or ain’t you a thief?!
COLE
I’m a Robin Hood thief! I want
that 20 million to give back to my
staff!
SLIDE
A thief is a motherfuckin thief!
So get your tidy whitey ass in
gear, and take a good look around
this place for something we can
cash in for our valuable time--!

93.
Slide stops cold. Cole follows his gaze. LOOKING THROUGH THE
1958 AUSTIN-HEALEY’S WINDSHIELD as our guys move into view,
Slide taking it in like he’s discovering lost treasure.
Which he might just be.
SLIDE (CONT’D)
Why’s he keep this up here?
COLE
Why do you think?

SLIDE
(surveying)
Nah. This is not a male
enhancement vehicle. This is a
showtune-singing little pussy car,
if you ask m-He stops, struck by something.
What.

COLE
What.

SLIDE
Pull up your flashlight app.
MOMENTS LATER, AT FLOOR LEVEL: The Austin-Healey’s body lifts
up and Slide wiggles underneath it. On his back, light beamblazing cell phone between his teeth. He looks up and down
the chassis, then draws up a pen knife and scratches at its
metal. He blinks as black flakes fall into his eyes.
Meanwhile, Cole grips the rear bumper, straining to keep the
two-seater lifted for Slide.
What.

COLE
What.

The only response is LAUGHTER, then:
Robin.

SLIDE
Your men gonna be merry.

EXT. THE TOWER -- ROOF -- MOMENTS LATER
Fitz has joined Dev and they sit here, nothing to do but
wait, when they hear the platform motor rev up. They rise to
see Cole and Slide ascend into view, empty-handed.
COLE
Change of plans.

94.
MOMENTS LATER: All four men stand in silence. It’s a lot
like their training scene on Cole’s roof, except they’re not
freezing and dumbfounded -- they’re just dumbfounded.
Finally, in disbelief:
DEV’REAUX
What kinda dude melts gold
down...into a chassis of a car?
COLE
Someone who’s number’s up.
They all think.
DEV’REAUX
Can we just break it up, take the
parts that are gold?
SLIDE
No time. Whole chassis’s made of
gold. Braniff’ll wake up soon.
FITZHUGH
Or Shoeless Jane’ll be back.
A beat.
DEV’REAUX
So that’s just it? We all just
tiptoe outta here and pretend none
of this happened?

No.

COLE
(an idea)

They all look at him.
INT. THE TOWER - CONSTRUCTION SITE ON 66 -- MOMENTS LATER
A door bursts open and Dev and Fitz sprint into the Hancock’s
apartment-under-renovation, deserted. As they hustle past
tools, planks, and other debris -FITZHUGH
...this is crazy, this is crazy,
this is crazy...
DEV’REAUX
...I know, I know, I know...
Arriving at the GIANT TARPS covering the windows, they rip
them down revealing a GAPING HOLE to the outside.

INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
A MATCHING GAPING HOLE exists now here, four flights up.
full panel of window has now been cut away;

A

the hole is large enough to, well, drive a car through. The
window-washing platform has been pulled inside and rests in
the living room, cables still attached.
Tires roll noiselessly across the hardwood floors. Slide
pushes the Austin-Healey as Cole steers, leaning in through
the driver’s window. They stop a few feet short of the
windowless panel.
Unhooking the cables from the window-washing platform, they
each lie down and attach them to the car’s undercarriage.
In the back, Braniff snores away, dead to the world.
Cole and Slide rise to test the cables: secure.
COLE
(into his walkie)
Mr. Dev’reaux?
INT. THE TOWER -- CONSTRUCTION SITE ON 66 -- CONTINUOUS
Dev and Fitz frantically build a ramp of cinderblocks and
planks and other material. Dev’reaux answers the call:
DEV’REAUX
Yes, Mr. Howard.
COLE’S VOICE
I need you back in position.
Dev tears off, leaving Fitz on his own, calling after him:
FITZHUGH
Wait, wait, wait: I have to do this
part alone?!
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
Svichkar has overheard this, bewildered. He turns to
Charlie, who senses the urgency in Cole’s voice.
SVICHKAR
“Back in position?” He was s’posed
to relieve me ten minutes ago.

96.
EXT./INT. THE TOWER -- PENTHOUSE/ROOF/CONSTRUCTION SITE
Cole and Slide look out the windowless panel, at the sidewalk
full of people far below.
COLE
Here’s where it gets tricky.
SLIDE
Oh, ‘cause it was so easy before!
DEV’REAUX’S VOICE
(breathless)
Mr. Howard, I’m in position.
Cole grabs hold of a beam and leans out the window to look
up. Above him, Dev leans over the edge. Cole signals him:
take it up.
UP ABOVE: Dev hits the ‘up’ button on the manual override,
muttering to himself in fear.
DEV’REAUX
My job’s “compartmentalized.”
Right. Well, I am exceeding my job
description! And I have EARNED my
motherfucking bonus!
IN THE PENTHOUSE: The cables grow taut and the Austin-Healey
starts to roll toward the open window. As the back bumper
clears the window, the cables lift the rear tires off the
floor and Cole and Slide gently push the car’s front out the
window and --- it’s aloft, dangling upside down a thousand feet in the
air, twisting in the breeze.
ABOVE IT: Dev stops retracting the cables and, with a signal
from Cole, begins to lower the car.
BELOW IT: Fitzhugh, alone in the construction site, watches
the automobile descend toward him.
FITZHUGH
Ah shit, it’s coming to me.
EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS
More ruddy faces, parade drums, bagpipes. High above, the
Austin-Healey looks like a white beetle creeping along the
glass seventy floors up. A few revelers notice, too drunk or
too immured by New York’s every day audacity to be alarmed.

EXT./INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY/FRONT ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS
Charlie’s attending to a RESIDENT when a PASSERBY shouts at
the lobby and points upward.

Charlie’s spine stiffens: this can’t be good.

He excuses

LESTER
Mr. Gibbs, what’d he mean?
They both push out onto the sidewalk til they come into view
of the Austin-Healey high above, inching closer to the
Hancock’s floor. Charlie rushes inside -CHARLIE
...ah-no, ah-no-no-no...
-- leaving Lester to peer up on his own, jaw-dropped.
EXT./INT. THE TOWER -- PENTHOUSE/ROOF/CONSTRUCTION SITE
Cole and Slide monitor the car’s descent. Fitzhugh signals
them: stop, and Cole signals Dev above: stop.
ABOVE: Dev stops the cables.
BELOW: Fitzhugh’s too cautious to just reach out and grab the
Austin’s grill. First, he finds some rope and ties it around
a cement mixer, then clinging to it with one hand reaches out
with the other --- and leaning half out the windowless panel he tries once,
twice, three times to grasp it.
Cole watches, concerned.
Fitzhugh gives a little slack to his safety rope and leans
out again. At last he manages to grasp the grille -Got it!!

FITZHUGH

-- just as another sharp gust of wind banks off the Tower and
pushes the Austin away from its face, dragging with it --- Fitzhugh, who loses his grip on the rope and ends up with
only a grip on the car, resulting in --

98.
-- his dangling a thousand feet in the air clinging to the
front of a vintage automobile made partly of gold as the
Saint Patrick’s Day Parade continues below him.
Crazier things have happened in New York. Cole and Slide
watch helplessly. There’s no way out of the apartment.
Dev watches, too, in horror.

Into his mic:

DEV’REAUX
Should I bring him up?!
Cole signals below: NO!

For fear it’ll jostle him.

Fitzhugh keeps one hand clasped to the grill and tries to
reach for the rope dangling out of the windowless panel with
the other. He’s inches from it. Still he can’t reach it.
He loses hope for a moment, then recommits himself, straining
to grasp the rope --- when A HAND lunges out and grabs him by the arm and yanks
him into safety.
It’s Charlie.

Who glares at him, mad but relieved.

CHARLIE
I must be out of my mind.
Fitz, on the floor, can’t believe he’s alive.
Cole and Slide peer down, mystified.
SLIDE
Where’d he go?
Then Charlie appears in the frame below, glowering up at
Cole. Cole can’t help but gratefully smile back. Then,
Charlie does something surprising --- he waves for the car to be lowered even more. Cole obeys
the order, gestures to Dev above to continue lowering. When
Charlie signals to stop, Cole repeats it.
Inside, Fitzhugh gasps for air.
Thanks.

FITZHUGH
I didn’t think you’d--

CHARLIE
Sir, you live in The Tower. It’s a
full service building. And we’re
pulling this baby in.

99.
MOMENTS LATER, FROM ABOVE: Charlie and Fitz both reach out
and grab the Austin-Healey, a two-man job if there ever was
one. Cole signals Dev to lower it and --- the ex-banker and concierge guide the car onto the
makeshift ramp until it’s safely rolled inside.
The cables go slack and Charlie signals for them to stop.
With Fitzhugh’s help, he disconnects the cables.
IN THE PENTHOUSE: Slide signals Dev to raise the cables as
Cole moves the window-washer platform in position.
ON THE ROOF: Dev hits ‘Up’ but nothing happens.

IN THE PENTHOUSE: Slide looks to Cole: you hear that?
peers up at Dev:

DEV

Cole and Slide realize: they’re not taking the platform outta
here. A moment of reckoning.
Arthur Braniff starts moaning and stirring.

Waking up.

SLIDE
How do you see it?
COLE
We leave by the door, we go to
prison.
Or--?

SLIDE

MOMENTS LATER, they step out onto the edge of the penthouse’s
windowless panel, cables wrapped around their waists, and --- begin rappelling down the side of the building, gloved
hand over gloved hand.
Cole looks down, sees Charlie and Fitzhugh waiting below, and
the sidewalk sixty-six stories beneath them. Jee-zus.
ON SIXTY-SIX: Dev arrives beside Charlie and Fitzhugh.

More and more people are starting to pay attention to the
stunt high, high above them. Among them: some COPS. They
start moving toward the Tower.
EXT./INT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS
Lester continues peering up. It’s begun to dawn on him just
who might be risking life and limb up there. And possibly
even why. He spies the cops rounding the corner, heading his
way, and he wanders back inside --- locking the front door behind him.
INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Braniff’s eyes open. He squints around the room: how the
hell did I get on the floor? He moans, then struggles to sit
up. And feels something odd: a breeze.

Moves into the next room.

At first, he doubletakes. Can’t believe it.
slowly realizes, yes, it’s true--

And

But as he

His Austin-Healey is missing!!!
He begins to hyperventilate.

Then, sobs like a girl.

OUTSIDE: Cole and Slide continue their shimmy down. Slide
arrives first and Fitzhugh grabs him and pulls him in.
IN THE PENTHOUSE: Braniff rushes into his living room. Sees
the window-washing platform. Then the missing panel of glass
in his window. The cables coming from the roof. Goes to
them.
FROM BELOW: He peers down from his window.

And sees --

-- one man scaling down one of the cables and another man
pulling him into safety.
Hey!

BRANIFF (CONT’D)

Cole and Charlie both look up.

And lock eyes with Braniff.

It’s hey-ho, let’s go all over again.

Cole detaches his cable.
COLE
Braniff saw us!
Shit!

SLIDE

CHARLIE
He saw us both.

Who nods: he’s in.

Arthur Braniff just set off his -Jillian’s out of her seat before he finishes.
EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- DAY
A CABAL OF POLICEMEN are pounding on the door and yelling.
Inside, Lester appears, playing up his old age; he puts a
hand to ear -- whatyawant? -- then starts fumbling in his
pockets, stalling for time: where did I put that key now...?

INT. THE TOWER -- ELEVATOR/CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY
Elevator doors open and Dev gets in. He hits a button, then
‘Close Doors’ urgently. He counts to two-thousand in his
head, then pulls the Emergency Break.
Back on 66, Cole, Slide, Charlie and Fitzhugh push the Austin
over the rubble of the construction site to the elevator.
Slide grabs a crowbar and pries its doors open. In the
shaft, the roof of Dev’s elevator has stopped two feet
beneath their floor level.
Sideways.

COLE

The four men tip the automobile on its side.
INT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- DAY
Lester finally gets the door open.

The Cops rush in.

LESTER
Slow down, slow down: gosh, what’s
all this fuss about?
INT. THE TOWER -- ELEVATOR/CONSTRUCTION SITE ON 66 -- DAY
The men have the Austin on its side -COLE
One-two-three, go.
-- then push it into the elevator shaft so that its grille
dips down atop the elevator car below. Like the flag-raisers
on Iwo Jima, they arc the Austin-Healey up and into the shaft
entirely. Everyone’s a little stunned it fit.
What now?

FITZHUGH

COLE
(to Slide and Fitz)
You and you, with me on top.
(to Charlie)
Take the freight to the basement.
Look for a place to hide this.
And then?

CHARLIE

COLE
I’ve got the ride down to figure
that out.

103.
Slide and Fitz step onto the elevator roof. Meanwhile, Cole
gives a last instruction to Charlie, unheard. Charlie takes
off and Cole joins them inside the shaft. They all take hold
of the car, to keep it steady. Cole smiles at Dev’reaux.
COLE (CONT’D)
How’re you liking the job so far?

Mr. Dev’reaux, basement please.
IN THE ELEVATOR CAR: Dev hits the button and they descend.

NYPD COPS have entered to inquire about ‘just-what-the-fuck’

JILLIAN
Where’s the elevator to the

floor on a panel)
Get it here.
INT. THE TOWER -- ELEVATOR/ELEVATOR SHAFT -- DAY
Dev sees ‘Lobby’ illuminate on his panel.

He shouts up:

DEV’REAUX
Guys! Someone’s calling for the
elevator from the lobby!
Cole, Slide and Fitz watch shaft walls zip up around them.
SLIDE
Can’t he override it?
COLE
Not from the lobby!
Something catches Fitzhugh’s eyes. The portion of the
chassis Slide scraped clean. It shines beautifully.
FITZHUGH
Holy God, it is made of gold.
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY/ELEVATOR/ELEVATOR SHAFT -- CONTINUOUS
Jillian waits impatiently. The elevator arrives at last and
its doors open to reveal Dev, trying to look nonchalant.

Braniff thrusts a finger toward the void in his apartment

INT. THE TOWER -- ELEVATOR/ELEVATOR SHAFT -- CONTINUOUS
As its doors close, Dev lets out a sigh of relief.
DEV’REAUX
Back to the basement?
Above, Cole thinks in silence.

Fitz and Slide trade a look.

COLE
No. Braniff’ll tell her it was us,
she’ll have agents scouring the
whole place.
FITZHUGH
Then where do we take this thing?
INT. THE TOWER -- 14TH FLOOR -- LATER
A quiet hallway. Then: elevator doors are pried open and a
two-seater sportscar is lowered onto it carpeting. Slide,
Fitzhugh and Cole push the car clear from the elevator shaft.
COLE
You guys got it?
They nod.

He tears away to the emergency stairwell.

At his front door, Fitzhugh fumbles for his keys, finds the
right one at last and inserts it -- under Slide’s withering
stare. Just as he gets it open -OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH,
His neighbor, the one we previously saw in a wheelchair
emerges from her apartment door. They’re caught red-handed.
Uhhh....

FITZHUGH

She looks at them. She seems entirely different. Her eyes
are clear, she’s spry, and she’s walking -- we realize this
is the first time we’ve seen her undrugged.
DEV’REAUX
Hello, Ma’am!

107.
There’s nothing good to say, so he babbles ridiculously:
DEV’REAUX (CONT’D)
It’s nice to see you up and about.
OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH
I’m extremely unhappy with this!
DEV’REAUX
We... don’t have much of an excuse,
ma’am.
The old lady barely glances at the guys, the car, the guilt
and fear on their faces.
OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH
Well, how in the world were you to
know that my daughter was
deliberately keeping me insensible!
(shaking her head)
What money does to people...!
The men stand there, holding a stolen car.
DEV’REAUX
We couldn’t agree more, ma’am.
She finally seems to focus on them -- a bit.
OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH
(beat, with total hauteur)
But I must say, this is very
shoddy. You gentlemen should be
using the service elevator.
She gets into the next elevator, muttering to herself. Being
mega-rich and still a bit addled, she is too self-preoccupied
to give a damn what these common men are doing.
OLD MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH (CONT’D)
...plummeting standards of
service... going to make a
complaint...
The doors close behind her. They all look at each other:
what the hell just happened. But no time to ponder. Fitz
and Slide push the Austin the rest of the way into
INT. THE TOWER -- FITZHUGH’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

They look at each other and smile. Holy shit, they did it.

INT. THE TOWER -- BRANIFF’S PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Agents fan out as Braniff backpedals a mile a minute to
Jillian.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
Oh, now, look, I have already cut
the deal, there’s nothing to talk
about! You take me in, you’ll get
called out on the carpet!
Agent Farley enters from another room, approaches Jillian.
AGENT FARLEY
You’ve gotta see this...
Jillian follows him. So does Braniff. They come into view
of the large hole in the wall Slide made and the empty safe
within it. Braniff hadn’t spotted this before and he
blanches. Meanwhile, Jillian realizes: this is the safe Cole
was telling her about. She tries not to smile.
JILLIAN
Mr. Braniff, there seems to be a
hidden safe in your apartment.
During our inventory of your
possessions you neglected to
mention this.
ARTHUR BRANIFF
I, uh, I...
JILLIAN
You’ve now violated two conditions
of your bail. I’m sorry to say that
Le Bernadin will not be delivering
to your next address. I hereby
remand you to federal custody.
Agent Farley steps up and cuffs Braniff, who realizes protest
will get him nowhere. Farley and Cunningham lead him out.
Jillian considers the empty safe again, then goes to the
absent window and looks out at the lines of cable twisting
downward. She can’t quite believe Cole did this.
JILLIAN (CONT’D)
(to a Junior Agent)
Do a sweep of the entire building.
Especially that floor with all the
construction.

INT. THE TOWER -- PACKAGE ROOM -- DAY
Charlie enters, sees cops in the lobby, not sure if he’s
being hunted, off-the-hook or what. He passes by Ms. Perez.
PEREZ
Where the hell you been? You
missed all the excitement?
Charlie pulls Perez aside.
CHARLIE
Miss Perez, can I trust you with
something?
INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
Svichkar’s on duty at the desk, Washington’s standing in as
lobby attendant, and Lester’s shooing away lookieloos out
front. Charlie taps Svichkar’s shoulder.
CHARLIE
Go on your break.

I got it.

Charlie tries to resume his work and not look guilty as hell
as cops and FBI agents scurry back and forth. He feels a
presence creep up behind him.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
We’re both screwed, you know that.
It’s Cole, out of his window-washer’s jumpsuit and back in
his manager’s threads at last.
I know.
though.

COLE
It’s been a pleasure,
--Well, not most of it.

From the elevators, Braniff is led out. As he passes through
the lobby, he stares daggers at Cole. But he says nothing.
Next: Braniff passes Lester on the way out.

Lester’s hands

LESTER
You can open the door yourself, Mr.
Braniff.
Exit Arthur Braniff.
COLE
At least he’s going away for good.

CHARLIE
Not from us. We’ll get the cell
next door.
Cole winces.
COLE
You do that thing I asked?
Charlie nods. Now, from the elevators, comes Jillian.
puts on a hopeful smile for her but it fades as she
approaches.

Cole

Because she looks deadly serious.
EXT. THE TOWER -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- MOMENTS LATER
IN SLOW-MO: A DRUMS-AND-BAGPIPES VERSION OF “MINSTREL BOY”
PLAYS AS CHARLIE AND COLE ARE LED OUT, COATS OVER THEIR
CLASPED HANDS TO DISGUISE THE HANDCUFFS ON THEIR WRISTS.
THERE’S MORE DIGNITY THAN SHAME IN THIS PERP WALK, LIKE
SOLDIERS BEING LED TO AN ENEMY’S FIRING SQUAD.
FROM INSIDE THE LOBBY, DEV WATCHES AS JILLIAN OPENS A REAR
SEDAN DOOR AND GUIDES CHARLIE AND COLE INSIDE.
IN A WINDOW ON THE 14TH FLOOR, FITZ AND SLIDE WATCH AS THE
FBI SEDAN PULLS AWAY.
FADE OUT.
A VOICE
This is FBI Regional Director Mazin
interrogating suspects Cole Howard
and Charles Gibbs in the robbery of
the penthouse apartment of Arthur
Braniff. March seventeenth, threethirty-four a.m..
FADE IN ON:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- FBI BUILDING -- NIGHT
DIRECTOR MAZIN and Jillian sit across from Cole and Charlie.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
Mr. Howard, Mr. Gibbs, as you’re
aware, Arthur Braniff identified
both of you as perpetrators in the
theft of his antique, sorry what
was it --

111.
JILLIAN
-- 1958 Austin-Healy -DIRECTOR MAZIN
-- thank you, the theft of his
antique 1958 Austin-Healey
yesterday from his seventieth floor
penthouse apartment in the Tower
building.
(he shakes his head, not
quite believing it)
Guys, I guess the principal
question I want to ask you is: why
the hell did you do this?
Cole and Charlie share a look: you wanna tell him?
COLE
As I did not do it, I can’t answer.
I guess, though, I can speculate.
I can tell you why I would do it if
given the opportunity, which of
course I have not had.
He lets this wash over the room for a moment, then continues.
COLE (CONT’D)
I personally would not want to
witness the faces of my staff when
they open their envelopes and find
zeros where their life savings used
to be. I know that I would do my
damndest to change the look on
their faces when those envelopes
are opened, to one of relief and
joy. I can honestly say that I
would do just about anything on
this earth to bring that about...
IF I had the ingenuity...
They are hanging on his words.
COLE (CONT’D)
...which, unfortunately, being a
glorified servant, I really don’t.
He smiles benignly -- the ultimate passive/aggressive coup.
Admitting nothing, admitting everything.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
That is tantamount to an admission,
sir, and don’t think--

112.
JUNIOR AGENT
Their lawyer is here.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
(to Cole and Charlie)
You guys call somebody?
(Cole and Charlie shake
their heads)
Send him in.
Ms. Perez enters, still in her Tower uniform, a legal valise
in hand. She carries herself like an experienced lawyer.
MS. PEREZ
Good morning. My name is Elizabeth
Perez, I’ll be representing these
gentlemen.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
(eyeing her uniform)
Ms. Perez, are you licensed to
practice law in New York State?
MS. PEREZ
As of noon yesterday, yessir, I am.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
Have a seat then. You know the
charges being brought against your
clients?
MS. PEREZ
I do. And I’m going to ask that
they be immediately dropped.
DIRECTOR MAZIN
On what grounds?
She opens her valise and withdraws the CD-ROM from Braniff’s
safe (which Charlie gave her earlier).
DIRECTOR MAZIN (CONT’D)
What is that?
Jillian has a pretty good idea; she won’t meet Cole’s eyes.
But she’s smiling.
EXT. FBI BUILDING -- NIGHT
Cole and Charlie bid Ms. Perez adieu.

113.
COLE
Not twenty-four hours a lawyer and
you’re already blackmailing the
Feds.
PEREZ
(grins)
Sharks are born swimming.
CHARLIE
What just happened in there?
COLE
Those were Braniff’s files on the
disc.
(as Perez nods)
You look at ‘em?
(she nods)
Make a copy?
(she shrugs: maybe)
Good girl. You may take the rest
of the day off.
MS. PEREZ
Thank you, gentlemen.
She means for their actions yesterday. She shakes both their
hands and goes. Cole and Charlie consider each other, gulf
between them long gone. They start walking.
Jillian, in a window above, watches them go.
EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN -- DAYBREAK
As we first saw it. City waking up.

INT. THE TOWER -- LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
Cole and Charlie enter. Lester says nothing -- he drops all
professionalism and hugs them.
As they cross the lobby they are aware of a SLOW BUILDING OF
APPLAUSE from the porters, janitors, Mr Svichkar -- everyone.

114.
They pass the elevators.
DEV’REAUX
Good morning, Mr. Howard.
morning, Mr. Gibbs.

Good

Cole grabs him by the neck and hugs him. Charlie tussles his
hair. Cole turns back to his staff, moved beyond words. He
looks around at the applauding lobby, tries to think of
something to say...
He never gets the chance.
furious.
You two.

MR. SIMON looms before them,

MR. SIMON
Now.

He leads them backstage.

Off their reactions: uh-oh...

INT. THE TOWER -- FITZHUGH’S APARTMENT -- DAY
PROFESSIONAL MOVERS carry his furniture and boxes out the
front door. The Austin-Healey is noticeably absent; instead
there is a pile of boxes marked “Living Room,” “Kitchen,”
“Kids’ Room.”
FITZHUGH
Guys, there are my irreplaceable
pre-Columbian crock pots in that
box so take extra care, okay?
Two movers SCREAM in pain lifting an ultra-heavy couch.
MOVER
Jesus! This thing’s a hernia and a
half! What’s it made of, lead?
Fitzhugh knows the answer but won’t share it.
Stepping out of his bathroom is Slide, wiping grease from his
hands, having been up all-night dismantling the Austin. He
watches it being carried out in boxes and furniture.
SLIDE
Looks like you got it from here.
See you at Trump Towers?
FITZHUGH
We’ll split things up there.
Off a Mover’s odd look, in explanation -FITZHUGH (CONT’D)
We’re lovers.

115.
INT. THE TOWER -- COLE’S OFFICE -- DAY
Mr. Simon closes its door behind Cole and Charlie.
MR. SIMON
(he takes them in)
I don’t know who you know or what
you used to get out of this but I
want you to know: I know what you
did yesterday. You two are through
here. And don’t think the
residents board doesn’t know what
you did!
Really?

COLE
They all know?

MR. SIMON
You of all people know how clubby
these people are!
COLE
I do. And, because they are so...
(crosses his fingers)
“...clubby,” I’m sure most of them,
if not all of them, were heavily
invested with Mr. Braniff. And
might be just a bit pissed at
him...?
Mr. Simon’s face falls.
EXT. THE TOWER -- STAFF ENTRANCE -- A DAY LATER
Mr. Simon is shown the exit, his possessions packed into a
box. Various staff wave “so long” as Mr. Simon staggers
away: what the fuck just happened?
Mr. Simon stares at them flabbergasted.
INT.

JILLIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

It’s her usual evening. The couch, some work scattered
around, the TV on. There is a KNOCK.
She frowns.

She’s not expecting anyone.

A CARD is slid under the door.
Then opens the door.
It’s Cole.

She picks it up, reads it.

116.
She turns and walks back into the room, continuing to look at
the card.
JILLIAN
“...Property Manager..?”
Simon’s job.

Mr.

COLE
And Charlie got mine.
JILLIAN
It’s “Charlie” all the time now?
(as Cole nods)
Well, that’s something.
She takes a good look at him. For the first time since we’ve
met him, he’s wearing the casual, but sneakily stylish,
clothes of a truly liberated man.
JILLIAN (CONT’D)
I’ve thought a lot about you.
She sits at her table.
How so?

So does he.

They face each other.

COLE

JILLIAN
I just have not been able to get
over what you did. I’m serious -it really affected me -COLE
I’m not a criminal, Jillian.
(sighs)
It took everything I had to bend my
brain around the idea that, even if
stealing’s wrong, some time, some
place, there’s gonna be that one
sonofabitch who just has it coming.
(sighs)
Okay. I know. I don’t blame you.
I’m a thief. --Yeah. I know. I

No question.

Cole’s jaw drops -- she

OVER END CREDITS:
A MONTAGE OF THE TOWER STAFF opening their pay envelopes.
As each of them reads the figures inside, their eyes go wide.
Some scream, some faint, some cry, and some do a spazzy happy
dance.
Dev’reaux immediately has to hand his check to the BURLY
UKRANIAN GUYS who wag their finger at him -- don’t fuck with
us again. They go.
