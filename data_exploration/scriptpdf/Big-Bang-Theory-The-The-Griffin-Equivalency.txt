Yes.

Good.

LEONARD
Just sit down and eat.

Fine.

I'm sorry.

He's not going to have intercourse

That's northwest Texas.

I'm from east

Texas, the Gulf region.

Home to many

Vietnamese shrimpers.
LEONARD
Do they feature in your story?
SHELDON
No.

Anyway, when I was eight, a

Montgomery Ward delivery van ran over
our family cat, Lucky.
WOLOWITZ
Lucky?
SHELDON
Yes, Lucky.
WOLOWITZ LOOKS AT LEONARD.
LEONARD
He's irony impaired.

Move on.

WOLOWITZ
Okay, dead cat named Lucky.

Continue.

SHELDON
While others mourned Lucky, I realized
his untimely demise provided me with
the opportunity to replace him with
something more suited to my pet needs.
A faithful companion I could snuggle
with at night and yet would be capable
of killing upon telepathic command.

So, not a puppy.
SHELDON
Please.

Nothing so pedestrian.

I

wanted a griffin.
LEONARD
A griffin?
SHELDON
Yes, half eagle, half lion.
LEONARD
And mythological.
SHELDON
Irrelevant.

I was studying

recombinant DNA technology and I was
confident I could create one, but my
parents were unwilling to secure the
necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.
Of course, my sister got swimming
lessons when she wanted them.

Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a

SHELDON

My point is if Koothrappali is moving
on to a new life of shallow, undeserved
fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to
create a better cohort.
LEONARD
You want to breed a new friend?
SHELDON
That's one option.

But consider this:

The Japanese are doing some wonderful
work with artificial intelligence.

You

combine that with some animatronics
from the Imagineers over at Disney and
next thing you know, we're playing Halo
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.
WOLOWITZ
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong
way, but... you're insane.
LEONARD
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
SHELDON
For the record, it could kill us to
meet new people.

They could be

murderers or the carriers of unusual
pathogens.

If we do get a new friend, he should
be a guy you can trust, a guy who has
your back.
WOLOWITZ
And he should have a lot of money and
live in a cool place down at the beach
where we could throw parties.
SHELDON
And he should share our love of

WOLOWITZ
And he should know a lot of women.

Let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed: Our new friend is
