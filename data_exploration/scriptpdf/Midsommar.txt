EXT. WOODS - HÄLSINGLAND - DAY

1

Hälsingland, North Sweden. We cycle through a series of
beautifully composed midday landscapes. None of them feature
people or human habitation.
A spare Swedish lullaby plays over this quiet montage. This
is the song of the Hårgas. When it concludes, we CUT HARD TO:
2

EXT. HOUSE - MINNESOTA - NIGHT

2

A beautiful suburban home, bathed in vivid moonlight. The
neighborhood is very quiet.
3

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

3

A MAN and WOMAN (early sixties) lay asleep in bed. They are
extremely still.
The PHONE rings. The Man and Woman do not stir. After a few
rings, the ANSWERING MACHINE takes it.
ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
Hello. You’ve reached -MAN & WOMAN (V.O.)
-- the Ardor residence.
ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
Please leave your message at the
tone. When you’re finished with
your message, press pound.
BEEP. Enter the voice of a YOUNG WOMAN:
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
Hey mom and dad, it’s Dani. Sorry I’m
calling so late. I’m just checking in
to make sure everyone’s okay. I got
kind of a scary email from Terri and
it sounded like you guys were having
some sort of conflict? Anyway, I just
got a little worried, so call me when
you can, and if there’s anything I
can do, just please know that I’m
here. Okay. All right. I love you.

INT. BEDROOM - BROOKLYN, NY -

NIGHT

4

The young woman lowers the cell from her ear. This is DANI
(25), a beautiful but delicate brunette. She hangs up, and
turns to her laptop. An EMAIL from Terri Ardor, titled “dear
dani,” is displayed. It reads:
i cant anymore - everything’s black - mom and dad are
coming too. goodbye.
Dani stares at this, anxiety rising. She picks up her phone,
hesitates, and then calls Christian.
Four rings. CHRISTIAN (25) answers. The rest of this scene
will be shot in a VERY TIGHT CLOSE-UP of Dani.
Hi...!

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

2.
Dani affects a care-free tone:
DANI
Hey baby. What you up to?
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Oh, just smoked some resin at Mark’s
and now we’re getting pizza.
Oh nice.

DANI

In the b.g., we hear a young man repeating “hi Dani, hi Dani,
hi Dani...”
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Yeah - he’s saying hi right now,
over and over.
Hi Mark!

DANI

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
(off-phone)
“Hi Mark.”

DANI
So I was just calling to see if you
were still wanting to get together.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Oh - did we talk about doing
something tonight?
DANI
I mean, not concretely. I was just
seeing.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
(ambivalent)
Uh, well - okay. Yeah. I should be
able to swing by.
DANI
All right...!

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Yeah. Okay... How’s the
sister situation?

DANI
Well. I’ve now sent her three
emails and still no response... I’m
starting to get a little nervous.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
I’m sure it’s fine.
DANI
Yeah. Probably. I hope so.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
She does this every other day,
Dani. And only because you let her.
DANI
Well, I don’t LET her. She’s
bipolar.

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
I know, but you do, though,
babe. You go straight to
crisis mode.

3.
DANI
Well - but she’s my sister. And even you
admit this last email was different...
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Okay, but is it, though? It’s still
another clear ploy for attention just like every other panic attack
she’s given you.
Dani looks like she wants to argue with this. She stifles it.
DANI
Okay. Yeah. You’re right. You are right.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
The more you respond, the more she’s
encouraged to keep this crap up.
DANI
No, I do know you’re right. I just
needed to be reminded. Thank you.
I’m really lucky to have you.
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
Me too.

DANI (CONT'D)
I love you.

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
...So do I.
DANI
Okay. See you later?
Yup.

CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

DANI
Okay. “Bye Mark!”
CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
“Bye Mark.”
DANI
All right. Love you. Bye.
Dani hangs up. Her eyes are wide with insecurity.
5

INT. KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER
Dani stands in the kitchen, mid-phone conversation.
FRAUGHT. She paces when she’s not speaking.
DANI
It’s just in his tone - you can hear it.
It’s like he’s trying to work up the
nerve to say something and I just keep
staving it off.
GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
So don’t stave him off. Be direct!
Confront him!

5

4.
DANI
Well - what if I scared him?
I’m always roping him into my
family crap...
I’m always leaning on him! I
tell him everything!
I even called him today in
tears because my sister sent
me another scary email. What
if I’m scaring him off?

GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
Oh - how do you rope him in?
That’s what he’s there for!

GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
What did your sister write?
DANI
Oh - just some ominous bullshit! She
does it all the time! It’s torture, and
I’ve been completely leaning on him for
support! What if I overwhelmed him and
now he thinks I have too much baggage?
Dani opens a prescription bottle of ATIVAN. She pops one.
GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
Well, if that’s the case, then good
riddance! Right?
DANI
No! Not if I went too far! What if I
leaned too heavily?
Dani has returned to her laptop.
GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
You didn’t! He should be there when
you need him.
Dani begins hastily composing an EMAIL to her sister Terri.
DANI
But what if I need him too
often? If it becomes a chore?

GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
Then he's not the right guy.
Because it shouldn't ever be
a chore. Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?

Dani breaks from writing to respond:
DANI
But he never asks for anything from
me! I've never even seen him cry!
So I'm the only one leaning!
GIRLFRIEND (V.O.)
Or the only one opening up! The
only one making yourself
vulnerable. That's intimacy.
As the friend says that, Dani finishes typing. Her email reads:
"PLEASE write me back, Terri. You can't just write me something
like that and then disappear. I'm worried sick and I think my
boyfriend is breaking up with me and I'm freaking out. Please
write back. Please."
Dani’s phone beeps with an INCOMING CALL. It’s an UNKNOWN NUMBER.

5.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NEW YORK, NY - NIGHT

6

A grubby pizza parlor. Outside the window looms a purple NYU sign.
CHRISTIAN, very handsome and fit, sits at a booth. Beside him
are his friends MARK (26, droll, shaggy hair), JOSH (27, a
skinny, sometimes snobbish academic), and PELLE (26), a nicelooking Swedish exchange student. Pelle doodles on his napkin
(drawing the flowers on the table).
Mark is currently lecturing a despondent Christian.
MARK
Dude: you need to stop sitting on
the fence with this.
CHRISTIAN
But what if I end up regretting it
a week later, and then I can’t get
her back?
MARK
You don’t want her back!

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
I might!

MARK
So then you can bitch to us for that
week about how much you regret it, and
we'll be like “Dude: you’ve been
wanting out of this absurd relationship
for the last year,” and you’ll be like
“oh shit, that’s right” and then you
can find some new chick who actually
likes sex and who doesn’t drag you
through a million hoops a day.
Christian is thinking about this. Extremely conflicted.
JOSH
Do you think a masochistic part of you
is playing this drama out to distract
you from the work you actually need to
be doing?
CHRISTIAN
(prepared to be offended)
And what work do I actually need to do,
Josh?
JOSH
Uhhh - your prospectus maybe? I dunno.
Your PhD...?
Christian clearly doesn’t want to be told his priorities by
Josh. Before he can snap back, an attractive WAITRESS (early
20s) brings over the check.
WAITRESS
Whenever you guys are ready.
PELLE
(with Swedish accent)
Thank you.
She SMILES -- at Christian.
Thank you.

WAITRESS

6.
She HOLDS the smile with Christian and walks bashfully off.
Mark definitely caught that.
MARK
Dude. You could be getting that
girl pregnant right now.
PELLE
And don’t forget all the
Swedish women you can
impregnate in June.

MARK (CONT'D)
Yeah, dude - don’t forget all
the Swedish milkmaids.

Christian’s PHONE rings. He checks. It’s DANI. He deflates.
MARK (CONT’D)
Who is that?
Christian doesn’t respond.
MARK (CONT’D)
That’s not her again? Seriously?
Christian lets the call go.
MARK (CONT’D)
That’s ridiculous, dude. She needs
a therapist.
CHRISTIAN
She has one.
MARK
So she should call him! That’s
insane, dude. She’s using you.
The phone starts ringing again. Christian checks it. “Dani again.”
Oh my God.

MARK (CONT’D)

Christian answers. He rises from the booth to get some privacy.
Hello?

CHRISTIAN

On the other end: an extended, agonized MOAN.
Dani?

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)

DANI (V.O.)
(distantly)
...no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
CHRISTIAN
Sweetheart? What’s going on?
But now there’s only heavy, frightening CRYING on the other
end. It’s a deep, horrible cry. One of pure animal grief.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(now scared)
What’s happening, baby? Please talk
to me.

7.
The crying has curdled into a sustained WAIL OF ANGUISH.
7

INT. GARAGE - MINNESOTA - NIGHT

7

The house from the beginning (scene 2).
Two CARS are parked. Their engines hum quietly. A FIREFIGHTER
opens one car’s door and turns OFF the ignition.
We now reveal that the end of a GARDENING HOSE has been taped
to one car’s EXHAUST PIPE. A second hose has been taped to the
other car’s exhaust pipe. Both hoses TRAIL out of the garage
and INTO the house...
8

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

8

One gardening hose leads to a BEDROOM DOOR. The door is now
open, but the end of the hose has been TAPED to the bottom...
9

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

9

The bedroom of the sleeping MAN and WOMAN (in their 60s, from
the beginning). It is very clear now that they are DEAD.
Two police officers survey the room.
HARD CUTS to the man and woman being ZIPPED UP into body bags.
10

INT. TERRI’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

10

TERRI (24), Dani’s sister, sits on the floor of her bedroom,
beside her desk. The end of the other gardening hose has been
DUCT-TAPED TO HER MOUTH. A mess of vomit has dried around the
edges of the hastily applied tape.
On Terri’s desk: her LAPTOP. It is open to the EMAIL THREAD
between her and Dani. In the bottom right corner of the
screen: “3 New Messages from Dani Ardor.”
11

EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN, NY - NIGHT

11

Dreamy snowfall in Brooklyn.
Christian, bundled up in layers, RUNS down the street. He’s
approaching DANI’S BUILDING, but even as he rushes, he’s not
going as fast as he possibly could. There’s an ambivalence in
his stride.
He enters the front door of Dani’s building.
12

INT. DANI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

12

Wide on the LIVING ROOM. We’re centered on the COUCH, where
Christian sits. Dani has crumbled there, her head shaking
violently against Christian’s lap as she WEEPS. Behind them:
a WINDOW showcases snowfall against the dark night.
Dani’s sobs are possessed of a profound despair. It’s so
intense that it looks painful - dangerous even.
We are pushing in on this, toward them. Christian’s eyes are
wide with worry. A worry that goes beyond Dani’s well-being.
He stares into space, imagining a future that he’s being
chained to. He looks TRAPPED.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

8.

We continue pushing toward them until we have pushed PAST
them. The window behind them FILLS our frame.
Through the window - HEAVY SNOW raging in a black vacuum. We
hold on this as our OPENING CREDITS ROLL, accompanied by
intense, groaning score.
After the credits, we SLAM CUT TO:
DAYLIGHT. We are still looking out the window, but it’s now
late afternoon. LATE SPRING.
13

INT. DANI’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 6 MONTHS LATER

13

Dani lies on her bed, fully clothed. Her eyes are numb as she
stares at the wall.
A KNOCK at the door. A well-dressed Christian pops his head
in. He’s grown a beard since we last saw him.
CHRISTIAN
Hey babers. How we feeling?
DANI
(looking to him)
Hey.
(sitting up)
I’m up.
CHRISTIAN
I’m just going to that party
for like 45 minutes. You
should keep sleeping.

DANI (CONT'D)
Oh - I’ll come with
you...!

CHRISTIAN
(hesitates)
You sure you got enough rest?
DANI
I wasn’t sleeping anyway.
Christian pauses briefly, as if this clashes with his plans.
CHRISTIAN
Okay, great! Well, I was gonna leave
in like three minutes, so I’ll just
be at the door.
DANI
Okay. I’ll just get dressed.
Christian nods for a little too long, then “smiles” and
leaves the room. Dani rises. Stands for a moment. Heavy.
14

INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

14

A PARTY in a brownstone full of circulating twenty-somethings.
Dani stands with Christian, who chats with Josh, Mark (holding
two beers), Pelle, and a stoned HIPSTER GUY (26).
HIPSTER GUY
I’m fucking dreading the summer. Stuck
in Boulder while my dad watches Law &
Order all day.

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

9.

MARK
Yeah, man - I have to visit my parents
in shit-ass Tucson after we all get back.

*

Dani squints with curiosity. Christian suddenly looks nervous.
HIPSTER GUY
Oh - you guys are going somewhere?
To Sweden!

JOSH

Hälsingland.

PELLE

MARK
Mr. Pelle’s invited us for an authentic
hippie midsummer at his yodeling farm.
Dani has PAUSED. She hadn’t heard this before.
DANI
...Oh yeah?
Dani turns to Christian, who now looks semi-panicked.
CHRISTIAN
I mean, yeah, we were thinking about
maybe - we were talking about it.
For when?

DANI

Dani feigns casualness as she looks inquiringly to the guys.
JOSH
...Mid June to late July?

MARK
In two weeks.

CHRISTIAN
I mean, if we even go. I probably
won’t. We were just talking about it.
Mark, Josh and Pelle stand awkwardly, confused. Christian
clearly hasn’t been honest with Dani.
15

INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - NIGHT

15

Christian and Dani ride the L train back home.
Christian stands, gripping the rail. Dani sits to his side.
Her eyes are BUSY with nagging, paranoid thoughts. Christian,
very tense, looks down at her from the corner of his eye.
Dani looks up at Christian uncertainly. Christian forces a
casual “hey” smile. She “smiles” back.
16

INT. CHRISTIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

16

Christian’s apartment is choked with cultural artifacts
(pieces acquired in China, South America, Africa, etc.).
The door opens. Christian and Dani enter. Christian goes to
his laptop and turns it on. Dani stays by the door, still
preoccupied. Christian looks to her.
CHRISTIAN
Are you okay?

10.
Dani looks at him, hesitant to start a fight. Christian gives
her an impatient look: “Yes? No?”
DANI
I mean - yeah. I’m okay. That was
just...very weird.
CHRISTIAN
(playing dumb)
What was?
Dani looks at him: “Seriously?” Christian widens his eyes:
“What was weird?”
DANI
The...Sweden! I had no idea.
CHRISTIAN
Well - what do you mean? I told you
I wanted to go.
DANI
Okay, fine, but I didn’t know you
were going.
CHRISTIAN
Well, I just decided today. I wasn’t
keeping it from you.
DANI
You already have a ticket!
Beat. Christian now looks cornered.
CHRISTIAN
(shrugs)
I’m sorry.
Christian looks extremely defensive. He has LOCKED DOWN. Dani
sees this, gathers herself, and tries to explain:
DANI
It’s just -- imagine if we
were at a party and someone
asks "what are you doing this
summer," and my friends say:
"oh, we’re all going to
Alaska for three months,
we’re leaving in two weeks,”
and imagine that was the
first you’d ever heard of it!

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)

(correcting)
A month and a half.

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Okay: I told you I wanted to go to Sweden.
DANI
You told me it would be “cool to go.”
CHRISTIAN
Yeah! And then I got the
opportunity to go and I
decided to do it.

DANI (CONT'D)
I have no problem with you
going! I just wish you'd
involve me!

CHRISTIAN
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

11.
DANI
You didn't apologize, you said (shrugs)
- "sorry." Which sounds more like
"too bad."
Beat. Christian’s eyes are now very cold.
CHRISTIAN
Maybe I should just go home.
DANI
...I’m just trying to understand.
CHRISTIAN
And I tried apologizing.
DANI
I don't need an apology. I just
wanna talk about it.
Pause.
CHRISTIAN
I think I should just prob’ly go home.
Dani looks helpless.
DANI
I'm not trying to attack you.
CHRISTIAN
Well, it feels like that.
DANI
Well...I’m sorry! I am sorry. I
just got confused.
Christian’s eyes, looking down, haven’t begun to thaw. Dani,
now desperate to reverse the mood, sits on the couch. She
beckons him.
DANI (CONT’D)
Come on: Sit with me. I'm sorry. That
just felt weird, that's all. I think
going to Sweden could be really great
for you. That sounds amazing. Are you
going for your thesis?
CHRISTIAN
(quietly)
I don’t know what my thesis is.
DANI
(brightly)
I know! It could be inspiring! Right?
CHRISTIAN
(still looking down)
...I think I’m just gonna leave.
Dani’s eyes start to well intensely with TEARS.
DANI
Please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
overreact. Please.

12.
Christian SOFTENS when he sees that she’s crying. Still
distant, he sits with her.
CHRISTIAN
Okay - shhh. It’s okay. I’m sorry,
too. All right?
DANI
I get paranoid. I'm sorry. I'm going
through all this stuff and I've been
dealing with all this panic and I
just - overreacted. I'm not trying
to put pressure or accuse you of
anything. I just got crazy for a
second. I didn't mean to project.
Christian strokes her hair.
CHRISTIAN
It’s okay. I’m sorry, too. It’s okay.
Beat.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(uncertainly)
I was gonna ask you to come with me.
Pause. Dani looks at him.
DANI
What do you mean?
CHRISTIAN
...What I just said.
To Sweden?

DANI

Christian nods a stiff “yes.”
DANI (CONT’D)
You don’t want me to.
CHRISTIAN
I just asked you.

DANI (CONT'D)
After I broke down crying!

CHRISTIAN
Well...you ruined the surprise.
Dani searches Christian’s eyes. They aren’t especially warm.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
I wanted it to be romantic.
17

INT. MARK & JOSH’S APARTMENT - DAY

17

Mark & Josh’s apartment is essentially a stoner’s den crossed with
a serious anthropologist’s home. Ironic posters (a portrait of
Ronald Reagan, etc.) are countered by a huge poster of James
George Frazer. There are stacks of books in every corner.
Christian, Mark, Pelle and Josh sit in the living room, smoking
from a bong. Josh holds a book by Johannes Bureus (titled
Adalruna) and Pelle is drawing in his notepad.

13.
JOSH
Are the Swedes sensitive about their
history of Nazi collaboration?
PELLE
Are you sensitive about Hiroshima?
Or slavery? Or the trail of tears?
JOSH
(deadpan)
Yes.
Christian looks extremely preoccupied. His foot pumps
involuntarily. He receives a TEXT.
CHRISTIAN
(anxiously)
Hey guys, it’s Dani - she’s coming up.
...Okay.

MARK

JOSH
(re: weed and bong)
Should we clear all this?

CHRISTIAN
No no, it doesn’t matter. But uh listen...
Christian goes to buzz her in.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
...just so you guys know: she’s not
gonna actually come, but I invited her
on the trip. Just to not make it weird.
A moment of silence. Pelle sits especially frozen.
MARK
You invited her?
CHRISTIAN
Yeah, but she’s not coming.
JOSH
She doesn’t want to?
CHRISTIAN
(measuredly)
No: I "invited" her and she "accepted,"
but she's not gonna actually come.
Mark and Josh just stare at him.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
You guys know what she’s dealing with!
MARK
No, we know. I just didn’t
realize. It’s totally fine if
she joins.

JOSH
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

A KNOCK at the door. Christian goes to answer it, but before
he does, he reasserts:
CHRISTIAN
Okay, so just: you guys told me to
invite her and you know that she’s
coming. Agreed?

14.
They don’t respond. Christian now OPENS the door to DANI. She
enters with an almost apologetic smile on her face.
Hey.

DANI

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Hi baby.

(to the room)
Hey guys!

Hey!

JOSH/MARK/PELLE

DANI
How’s it going?
MARK
Just chillin’.
Nice.

DANI

A brief, awkward pause.
JOSH
So, Sweden...!
Yeah!

DANI

PELLE
You’re coming, right?
DANI
I think so...! If it’s not completely
destroying your guys’ male bonding
plans.
MARK/JOSH/PELLE
Nope. / Not at all.

CHRISTIAN
Oh, shut the fuck up.

Dani smiles bashfully. Mark abruptly addresses Christian:
MARK
Hey man, can I get you to look at
that paragraph real quick?
CHRISTIAN
(confused pause)
Sure. Yeah. Okay.
(to Dani)
Right back.
Christian kisses Dani, and leaves the room with Mark. Dani looks
to the ROOM. Josh has returned to his book. Pelle, alone on the
couch, warmly gestures for Dani to join him. She obliges.
Hey Pelle.

DANI
Hi Dani.

PELLE

She notices that Pelle has been composing a DRAWING in his
notepad. It’s a drawing of the room.
DANI
Ooh, that’s a nice drawing.
PELLE
Oh, thanks, yeah, I’m trying to be
a naturalist.

15.
Pelle closes the drawing pad. Gives Dani his full attention.
DANI
How’ve you been?
PELLE
Pretty good! Survived finals. You?
DANI
Uh, well - didn’t quite
finish! But they’re giving me
a break this year...

PELLE (CONT'D)
(realizing)
Oh, right. God. Of course.

Dani makes an embarrassed “bleh” face.
DANI
How did you like the anthropology
department?
PELLE
It’s good! I just can’t seem to choose if
I hate academia or not. Unlike this one.
(”this one” being Josh)
You’re doing psychiatry?
DANI
Psychology. Yeah. That’s how you
know I’m nuts.
PELLE
Also that funny look in your eye.
Dani LAUGHS, a bit unnaturally. An awkward moment.
PELLE (CONT’D)
So! You’re coming to Hälsingland!
DANI
Yeah! I can’t wait. Christian says
you’ve got a special thing in the woods
planned?
PELLE
Oh yeah - a sort of crazy, nine-day
festival we’re doing...
DANI
Do you do that every midsummer?
PELLE
Uh - well...not quite like this one.
DANI
(mock-scandalized)
Ooh. What makes this guy different?
PELLE
Well, “this guy” happens only once
every ninety years. So it’ll be a
first and a last for everybody.
Pelle raises his eyebrows, mock-menacing.
DANI
...Christian says you’re from a
really small community?

16.
PELLE
Oh yes - tiny. Very sort of...
(”what’s the word?”)
Incestuous? Incestual?
DANI
Depends on which of those you mean.
PELLE
Oh - ha! No: we’re just very secluded...
Pelle pulls up a PHOTO on his phone. Shows it to Dani. It
features a lush, impossibly green field. Young men and women
stand about - all dressed like hippies in white.
DANI
Oh wow! Flower children.

PELLE (CONT'D)
Big time! We do our own
thing, love our astrology...

DANI
What’s your sign?
PELLE
Taurus! You?
Cancer!

DANI

PELLE
Ooh, yes, I do see that. Your birthday?
DANI
July seven.
Pelle makes an “Ah” face. A thoughtful pause before he asserts:
PELLE
You know, I think it’s actually very
good you’re coming.
DANI
Oh yeah? For who?
PELLE
For you! And for my family. I think
you’ll be very...
Pelle weaves his fingers together, signifying a tight-knit
connection. Dani smiles. Pelle PAUSES again, and his tone now
CHANGES. He leans forward, sensitively:
PELLE (CONT’D)
You know...I never had the chance to
tell you, but I was really so very
sorry to hear about - your loss...
Oh...!

DANI

PELLE (CONT'D)
...and what happened.
I can’t even fathom. I mean,
I lost my parents, too, so I
have some idea, but...

Dani looks cornered. TEARS have welled up in her eyes.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Oh, no. Sorry to bring it up!

17.
DANI
No, I mean - thank you. I just...
I'm sorry.
(stands up suddenly)
I'll be right back. Bathroom. Thank you.
Dani rushes off. Pelle watches her with blank eyes.
Dani, stifling tears, enters the BATHROOM.
18

INT. AIRPLANE LAVATORY (IN FLIGHT) - DAY - 2 WEEKS LATER

18

Dani has entered an airplane’s lavatory, stifling an oncoming
deluge. After shutting the door behind her, she BREAKS DOWN
in a fit of violent SOBS.
19

INT. AIRPLANE (IN FLIGHT) - MINUTES LATER

19

We are WIDE, looking down the length of the plane. We track
forward, drifting over the heads of passengers.
In the b.g., Dani exits the lavatory and returns to her seat.
Christian is seated beside her at the window. We have arrived
at a PROFILE CU of them (the window in the b.g.).
Christian takes Dani’s hand and smiles at her. It’s clear
she’s been crying, but she hides it behind a determinedly
casual “all is well” expression.
Christian goes along with the pretending, and looks out the
WINDOW. We have begun a slow ZOOM past them, toward the
window. The window soon FILLS the frame. We are flying over
beautiful terrain. We have entered SWEDEN.
20

INT. STOCKHOLM AIRPORT - DAY

20

Dani, Christian, Josh, Mark and Pelle stand at a CUSTOMS DESK.
A CUSTOMS OFFICER looks over their passports.
CUSTOMS OFFICER
Purpose of your trip?
PELLE
Visiting my home in Hälsingland.
CUSTOMS OFFICER
All of you?
They all say “yes.” Christian, meanwhile, is desperately
searching his backpack for his passport.
The Customs Officer scrutinizes Dani’s passport.
CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT’D)
Happy birthday tomorrow.
DANI
Oh - thank you.
Christian, distracted from that, FINDS his passport.

INT. RENTAL MINIVAN (MOVING) - DAY

21

Our group, now in a rental minivan, drives through Stockholm
traffic. Pelle is at the wheel.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

18.

Mark sits passenger, holding a film theory book. In the back:
Dani, Christian and Josh. Josh is reading the Poetic Edda.
They pass a group of BEAUTIFUL BLONDE WOMEN.
MARK
(to Christian)
Oh my God, dude, the women here...!
Christian, aware of Dani, gives a self-conscious half-nod.
Dani happily pretends to ignore this.
MARK (CONT’D)
What is it that makes them hotter?
CHRISTIAN
The Vikings grabbed all the best
ones and dragged them over.
JOSH
Makes a pretty good case for rape,
from a nationalist point of view.
Dani WINCES at that one. They have now pulled onto the
FREEWAY - leaving Stockholm.
DANI
How far are we driving?
PELLE
Four hours, about.

MARK
(exasperated)
Oh my God.

Dani notices a book on Josh’s lap: The Secret Nazi Language
of the Uthark. Its cover is a runic pattern.
DANI
Why are you reading that?
JOSH
Ha. Ask Pelle.
PELLE
(accepting the cue)
We’re taught the runic alphabet in my
village. Josh just carries that
around to annoy me.
DANI
(to Josh)
What are you doing your thesis on, again?
JOSH
Uhhhh - Well! My focus is actually on
European midsummer traditions. Which
was actually sorta the impetus behind
this whole trip.
DANI
(to Christian)
That’s similar to what you’re thinking
of doing - right, baby? For your thesis?
CHRISTIAN
(tensely)
Well, I don’t know quite what I’m doing.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
(As you know.) But I’m thinking about
rooting it in something Scandinavian.

19.

DANI
See that, Pelle? You’ve managed to
brainwash all your friends.
PELLE
Josh was already brainwashed when I
found him.
JOSH
(re: Pelle’s acknowledgement)
Thank you.
DISSOLVE TO:
22

TWO HOURS LATER

22

Pelle is still driving. Everyone is silent and zoning out as
the radio plays an old Swedish folk tune.

*

Mark suddenly notices a DEAD BOAR on the side of the road.

*

MARK
That’s the second of those I’ve seen.
PELLE
Yeah, they’re a huge problem out
here. Everybody hunts them.
MARK
You ever gone boar huntin’?
Yep!
Is it fun?

PELLE
MARK

PELLE
...It’s cathartic and then it’s sad.
Beat. They drive past another dead boar, also in a field.
JOSH
They’re allowed to just leave them?
Mark alights on something ahead.
MARK
...the fuck?
Everyone looks up. In the distance, about 300 feet off the
road, is an OAK TREE with SEVERAL BOAR CARCASSES HANGING FROM
ITS BRANCHES.
CHRISTIAN
What is that?

Oh my God.

DANI

JOSH
Wait: slow down. Can you pull over
to it?
Why??

DANI

JOSH (CONT'D)
Please, Pelle.

20.
Pelle reluctantly slows down. He veers off the road and idles
to a STOP beside the tree. Josh marvels at it.
23

EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

23

The back door opens and Josh emerges from the car. Everyone
else filters out behind him.
Josh approaches the tree, stunned. A cacophony of buzzing FLIES.
JOSH
(to Pelle)
Do you know what this is?
No idea.

PELLE

Josh has pulled out his CELL PHONE. He starts to take
photographs of the tree from every possible angle.
DANI
This is horrible.

MARK
(to Pelle)
Is this how you people hunt
out here?

CHRISTIAN
It looks almost ritualistic.
JOSH
It looks absolutely ritualistic!
(takes more photos)
This is fucking amazing.
Dani looks extremely disturbed. She swipes away flies. Christian
pulls out his phone to take a single wide shot of the tree.
PELLE
Okay, let’s go. We still have a lot
of driving.
DANI
Fantastic. Thank you.
Everyone returns to the car. Except for Josh, who continues
his ecstatic photo-taking.
24

INT. RENTAL MINIVAN (MOVING) - DAY
Pelle is still driving. Christian sleeps in the back.
Everyone looks notably more tired. It’s been a long drive.
They pass a sign announcing (in Swedish) that they have
arrived in Hälsingland.
PELLE
Entering Hälsingland!
Everyone looks up.
MARK
Are we getting high right when we
get there?
TEN MINUTES LATER

24

21.
Pelle idles up to a LARGE GRASSY MEADOW. It’s lush, impossibly
green - magical. About fifty YOUNG PEOPLE (teens to twenties)
lounge about. Tents and camping equipment abound. Many of the
women are dressed in traditional white dresses and don floral
garland crowns. Some of the men look like 19th century farmers.
PELLE
Look, guys! New friends.
Pelle parks the minivan in the field.
25

EXT. MEADOW - CONTINUOUS

25

They all emerge, yawning and stretching. Dani is mesmerized.
Pelle WAVES to a bunch of people on the grass. They clearly
know each other well. Pelle gestures for our group to follow
him as he approaches a crowd of GIRLS.
Pelle!!

GIRLS

We cut WIDE as Pelle happily introduces everyone.
Then, across the field, a Chubby Blonde Guy (25) calls out to
Pelle. This is INGEMAR.
INGEMAR
(in Swedish)
Holy shit! Pelle!!
Pelle turns to Ingemar. His face LIGHTS UP, and he runs over
to him. Dani, Christian, Mark and Josh follow.
INGEMAR (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Happy St. John’s!
Pelle laughs. They hug.
INGEMAR (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Christ - you’re so skinny! Where’d
the rest of you go?
PELLE
(in Swedish)
Looks like you got it.

INGEMAR (CONT'D)
(in Swedish)
What the fuck? I look fatter?

PELLE
Here: English. These are my great
friends - Josh, Christian, Mark,
Dani: meet my brother Ingemar. Best
friend since we were babies.
INGEMAR
(recounting)
Josh, Christian, Mark...Dani?
(confirmed)
Awesome! And say hello to my friends,
Simon and Connie from London.
He gestures to an attractive British couple, CONNIE (24,
skinny) and SIMON (26, spectacled, tattooed).

22.
INGEMAR (CONT’D)
Simon and Connie, this is Pelle
and...all the names I just
remembered two seconds ago.
Hey.

SIMON

CONNIE

Hello.

INGEMAR
Perfect timing, by the way:
Ingemar pulls out a bag of MAGIC MUSHROOMS. Hands them to Pelle.
INGEMAR (CONT’D)
We just took these five minutes ago.
Haven’t even started coming up yet.
MARK
(overjoyed)
Ohhh shit.
Mark grabs the bag from Pelle and studies the contents.
PELLE
(to the group)
Do you guys wanna take it
now? Or should we settle in
first?

MARK (CONT'D)
Fuck it. Let’s just take ‘em.

DANI
(to Christian)
I think I might need to find my
footing first.
CHRISTIAN
Yeah. Of course.
(quietly)
And you know you don’t need to take
them. If you’re feeling unsure.
DANI
No, I just need to get settled.
CHRISTIAN
Okay. Well. I’ll wait for
you.

DANI (CONT'D)
No - go ahead!

CHRISTIAN
No, I’ll wait. We’ll come up together.
Josh and Mark and Pelle have pulled their mushrooms from the
bag. They look to Christian, ready to go.
Ready?

PELLE

CHRISTIAN
I’m waiting for Dani. You guys go on.
MARK
Dude. We can’t come up at different
times. They’ll be totally separate trips.
CHRISTIAN
Then you can wait for us.

23.
Mark looks frustrated - angry even.
DANI
You know what? That’s okay. I’m ready.
CHRISTIAN
Baby. Don’t feel rushed.
DANI
I don’t. I’m ready.
MARK
(false concern)
You sure?

DANI (CONT'D)
(bluntly)
Yeah, Mark, thanks.

INGEMAR
They made mushroom tea if you
prefer against the taste.
DANI
(considers)
Okay. Yeah. I’ll have that. Thank
you - Ingmar?
Ingemar smiles confirmation and goes to fetch her a mug of tea.
CHRISTIAN
Don’t let Mark pressure you.
Of all people.

DANI (CONT'D)
He’s not. It’ll get too
complicated otherwise. It’s
fine.

Ingemar hands Dani her TEA.
PELLE
(to Dani)
Ready?
Dani, now holding the tea, nods yes.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Okay. Here we go. Think happy thoughts!
They eat their shrooms. Dani hesitates before SIPPING the tea.
You okay?

CHRISTIAN

DANI
Yeah. It’s good. I’m excited.
CHRISTIAN
(still concerned)
Cool. Me too.
MINUTES LATER
Dani sits on the grass with Christian and Pelle. Mark is off
to the side, stabbing at an ANT COLONY with a stick. Josh
paces nearby. His stomach TURNS audibly.
JOSH
Uggghhh, I really don’t feel good.
Josh hunches over to RETCH.

24.
MARK
Don’t puke, dude. Keep it down.
CHRISTIAN
(to Dani)
How are you feeling?
DANI
A little like I have food poisoning.
PELLE
Technically you do. It’ll go
away soon.

CHRISTIAN
And you can throw it up if
you need to.

JUMP CUT to Dani VOMITING into a bush. Christian stands near her.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
That’s good, baby. It’s okay. Throw it
up.
Dani rises to take a breath.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Does that feel better?
PELLE
Don’t worry - you had it down long
enough. You’re still gonna trip.
MINUTES LATER
The group sits on the grass together. The sun is still shining.
CHRISTIAN
What time is it?
PELLE
Ten at night.
Mark sits up, alarmed.
MARK
What do you mean?!
PELLE
What do you mean?
MARK
That doesn’t feel right.
PELLE
Why? It’s the midnight sun.

MARK (CONT'D)
It doesn’t feel like ten. I
don’t like that! It feels
wrong.

A YOUNG MAN approaches.
CHRISTIAN
Oh fuck. It’s a new person.
MARK
What? I don’t want new
people.

PELLE
No - new people are good!

25.
The Young Man walks past.
Hey hey!

YOUNG MAN

The group mumbles hello.
MARK
I wanna lay down.
Mark lies down.
MARK (CONT’D)
Oh my God. Lay down. Guys. It’s so nice.
Everyone lies down. Except for Josh. For the rest of the
scene, our focus is on DANI - even as everyone else speaks.
MARK (CONT’D)
Lie down, Josh.
Josh doesn’t. Stubborn.
PELLE
Can you feel the energy come up
from the earth?
CHRISTIAN
Yeah, like a - pulsing.
Oh my God, they are. And the
grass!

PELLE (CONT'D)
And so are the trees. They’re
breathing.

The trees do seem to be breathing - visibly swelling and deflating
with psychedelic life. They LOOM IMPOSINGLY over Dani. They GROAN
in the wind, their branches leaning (almost reaching) down.
Pelle, marveling at his surroundings, sits up:
PELLE (CONT’D)
Nature just knows instinctually how
to stay in harmony! It’s mechanical.
Everything doing its part.
MARK
(emotional)
You guys are my family.
The word “family” HITS Dani.
MARK (CONT’D)
I really mean that. You’re like my
real actual Family.
Dani SITS UP, suddenly overwhelmed. Christian looks to her. She
looks to him. He SMILES, but there’s something false about it.
Dani looks SCARED now. This scares Christian.
CHRISTIAN
Dani? Don’t look like that.
Dani STANDS, panic mounting. Her eyes look crazed.
DANI
I’m sorry. I’m gonna walk.

26.
CHRISTIAN
I can walk, too.

DANI (CONT'D)
No no. Sorry. I’m gonna...

Dani starts to walk off, a terrible feeling rising in her.
JOSH
Is she mad at us?

MARK
I don’t like how she did
that.

Dani continues to walk. She’s starting to think very bad thoughts.
DANI
(to herself)
No, that’s not good. No. No.
She then stumbles onto a group of TEENAGERS - all wearing flower
garlands. They sit in a circle, passing around a homemade POTION
of some sort. They all look at Dani...and then BURST OUT LAUGHING.
Dani turns stiffly around, tears welling.
DANI (CONT’D)
No, no, no, no...
Dani tensely speed-walks away. Her surroundings are THROBBING
visibly (and more intensely than before).
INGEMAR calls out to Dani.
Hey! Dani!

INGEMAR

Dani freezes. Terrified, she looks in his direction. He waves
her over. He’s sitting with a group of happy twenty-somethings.
Dani warily approaches.
INGEMAR (CONT’D)
How are you feeling? Everyone: this
is Pelle’s friend, Dani.
Everyone says hi.
DANI
They were laughing at me over there.
INGEMAR
What? No, I’m sure they weren’t.
They probably just wanted you to
laugh with them.
But Ingemar’s face was MUTATING as he said that.
DANI
(terrified, forcing a smile)
Okay. Sorry. Never mind. Thank you.
Dani turns around and walks stiffly off.
DANI (CONT’D)
(trying to turn it around)
It’s okay. It’s not that. You’re
okay. It’s drugs.
She continues toward a sturdy wooden OUTHOUSE. She hastily enters.

27.
26

INT. OUTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

26

The interior of the outhouse is illuminated by CANDLE-LIGHT.
It’s very clean. Dani stands here for a moment.
DANI
This is a coffin.
(immediately reprimanding herself)
Hey! No it’s not.
Dani sees a MIRROR on the wall. She looks at it. Hard.
DANI (CONT’D)
Fuck you. Stop it.
Suddenly her skin seems to take on a translucent quality. Her
veins become faintly visible. Beneath her cheeks, it looks
like organic gears are turning.
DANI SQUEEZES HER EYES SHUT. She takes a moment, trying to
will that vision away.
DANI (CONT’D)
Don’t look in the mirror. It’s not
your face.
(saying that again, under scrutiny)
“It’s not your face.”
After a long moment, Dani OPENS her eyes again. When they
open, TEN ADDITIONAL EYES open simultaneously - all over her
face. Like spider eyes.
Dani SCREAMS and FLEES the outhouse...
27

EXT. OUTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

27

Dani runs frantically across the field, desperately wiping
off her face (as if to wipe off the extra eyes). We CHASE
AFTER HER before CUTTING TO:
28

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

28

Christian, Josh, Mark and Pelle are still lying in the same
spot. They’ve hit the peak of their trip. Twilight is coming.
In the b.g., a group has finished setting up LARGE SPEAKERS.
CHRISTIAN
Where did she go?
It’s okay.

MARK

JOSH
(looking at his hands)
Why the fuck do we have
fingerprints?

Christian STANDS, panic starting to build.
CHRISTIAN
Dani’s gone. We need to find Dani.
JOSH
I don’t feel like standing.

MARK
Yeah - I don’t wanna move.

CHRISTIAN
Hey! Dani’s our friend!

28.
MARK
She isn’t all of our friend.
CHRISTIAN
What? Yes she is. That’s not
nice! Why aren’t you ever
nice?!
You’re being mean!

MARK (CONT'D)
(scared by this)
What? I am nice.
(tearing up)
I’m not being mean!

Droning techno begins to THROB from the speakers in the b.g. With
every bass punch, the surrounding environment THUMPS visibly.
CHRISTIAN
Dani’s our friend. And she’s sad.
MARK
But that makes me sad!
(suddenly angry)
And she’s NOT our friend! She’s
barely YOUR friend! You only invited
her because you’re too scared to be
honest with her!
Christian pauses, FURIOUS, and then:
CHRISTIAN
Her family is dead, Mark! Do you get
that? They all died!
MARK
(suddenly terrified)
Why are you saying that?

Why???

MARK

CHRISTIAN
But that’s just so it can die
later.

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Because they are! They’re
dead!
JOSH
(insistent)
HEY! NO! We need to connect
back to the good things! This
is getting bad! Everything’s
alive right now.
MARK
(getting sucked into
darkness)
Oh God...!

PELLE
But then it gets reborn! Death is just
shit fertilizing crops. Everything
gets recycled and made new again.
Silence. Everyone looks at Pelle, catching up to what he just
said. Christian STOMPS OFF.
MARK
Wait! Christian! We need to stay together!
29

EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME

29

Dani paces in the woods. Muffled techno drones in the distance.
DANI
Hello?!... HELLO??!!
(redirecting her thoughts)
It’s almost your birthday. Fuck.
(MORE)

29.
DANI (CONT'D)
What time is it?
(then, PAUSES)
You were almost born... You’re a baby.
This gets to Dani. She now looks around the woods, fearfully.
Like a lost child.
DANI (CONT’D)
MOMMY?!... DADDY?!...
(silently to herself)
Mommy daddy mommy daddy...
(panicked now)
CHRISTIAN?!
No answer.
DANI (CONT’D)
No...no.... You’re alone.
Then it HITS Dani. Her eyes well intensely with tears. This
idea is now horribly significant.
DANI (CONT’D)
(a revelation)
You’re alone.
Dani sees a DEAD RABBIT. Its innards are splayed.
Dani warily approaches. Magnetized but repulsed. As she nears,
the FEAR rises in her. She gets close enough to finally see...
The rabbit is being devoured by ANTS.
Dani looks mortified, but her eyes are glued. She LEANS IN to
look closer, but then -- she sees ANTS on her arm. (Whether
they’re there or not is unclear.)
Dani SCREAMS. She violently SLAPS at her arm. She then swipes
at her other arm, and starts slapping at her NECK and FACE,
as if she were engulfed in ants. (She’s not.)
Dani looks down. The earth seems to now be a PULSATING CARPET
OF ANTS.
Dani SCREAMS and RUNS for her life. As she sprints:
Dani!

CHRISTIAN (O.S.)

Dani FREEZES, eyes crazed.
DANI
...Christian?!

CHRISTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Dani!!

Dani searches desperately for his voice. She FINDS him
standing at a CLEARING. She runs for him, crying.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Where the hell did you go?!
They EMBRACE. She hugs him. SQUEEZES him.
I got lost.

DANI

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Let’s go back to the group.

30.
DANI
(still squeezing)
Christian. Nothing means anything.
What?

CHRISTIAN

DANI
(looking at him)
Nothing means anything! We’re just
alone.
(tearing up)
And I felt this presence - like God
but not God - and it was telling me
this and it was laughing at me.
CHRISTIAN
You heard laughing?

DANI (CONT'D)
I felt it laughing! I figured
it out, that nothing means
anything and we’re born alone
and we die alone, and it was
getting pleasure from that.

Christian is getting SCARED. He takes Dani’s ARM CHRISTIAN
Okay: no. We’re going back to the friends.
- and starts leading her away.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
You’re having a bad trip, and you’re
thinking you’re alone because you went
off and you made yourself alone. You
just got scared.
He’s now PULLING Dani, aggressively.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(not even looking at her)
You have me. Everything’s connected.
We’re all one. Those are the good
things you’re supposed to think about
when you trip. We’re all unified. Fuck.
Christian has been leading her out of the woods. They emerge
onto the FIELD, where the droning techno is now very present
(and making the visible surroundings THROB to its beat).
We track alongside Dani and Christian as they walk uneasily
through the grass - past groups of happy, tripping strangers.
Christian’s eyes are glued tensely to the ground, combating dark
thoughts. Dani looks less frightened now than disconnected.
They arrive at Josh, Mark and Pelle, who are now accompanied
by CONNIE, SIMON, INGEMAR and a BLONDE SWEDISH GUY (20s).
Hey hey!
MARK
Where were you?

BLONDE SWEDISH GUY
PELLE
How are you, Dani?

31.
CHRISTIAN
(insistent)
We’re fine. She’s fine. Just took a
little walk.
CONNIE
(very high)
Are you feeling it?!
DANI
(to Pelle)
I wanna sleep. How can I sleep?
HOURS LATER
CLOSE-UP OF DANI’S SLEEPING FACE.
In the distance: a faint, barely discernible melody. It sounds
like a flute.
A HAND reaches into frame to nudge Dani. She stirs awake.
CHRISTIAN (O.C.)
It’s time to get up.
DANI
...how long was I asleep?
Dani sits up. It’s still BRIGHT outside. The visual
surroundings are no longer morphing. Mark and Pelle and Josh
are standing. Christian is crouched beside her.
DANI (CONT’D)
Did it get dark at all?
PELLE
For a couple hours. Not completely.
Then something occurs to Dani:
DANI
Is it tomorrow?
CHRISTIAN
...It’s today.
Dani looks at Christian, whose expression is blank. She SINKS
with quiet disappointment. (He forgot her birthday.) Christian
helps Dani up. She wobbles.
DANI
Where are we going?
PELLE
Where we came for.
30

EXT. WOODS - DAY

30

Everyone from the meadow CRUNCHES through the woods. Our group
is at the end of the queue (carrying their bags). As they walk,
the MELODY is growing clearer and louder. It’s a happy tune.
The group’s footing is unsteady. Dani, especially, keeps
stumbling over her own feet. She grips Christian’s wrist.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

32.

MARK
The come-down on these
mushrooms is really intense.
Dani notices a few disparate FLOWERS sprouting up from the
ground. As she walks, the flowers continue to accumulate.
Soon she’s walking down a controlled, narrow TRAIL of wild
yellow flowers - all leading toward a CLEARING.
MARK (CONT’D)
Okay: am I still tripping or is
there a lot that people aren’t
acknowledging right now?
The group finally arrives at the clearing. It opens to another
FIELD, beyond which is a SMALL VILLAGE. The melody is being played
by a floutist, a fiddler and a key harpist. The scene is UTOPIC.
JOSH
(mesmerized)
This is the place?
PELLE
(slightly tongue-in-cheek)
The tranquil and majestic Hårga.
They continue toward it, approaching a Hälsingegård (a farm).
About a HUNDRED PEOPLE stand on the grass, waiting. They are
dressed like Amish people, but less formal. They appear to be a
WELCOMING COMMITTEE.
CHRISTIAN
(to Pelle)
You know all these people?
PELLE
These are my family!
31

EXT. HÅRGA FARMSTEAD - CONTINUOUS

31

They arrive at the FARMSTEAD. At the center is one particularly
LARGE building in the shape of a barn; this is the MAIN HOUSE.
Surrounding this are several houses, a horse stable, a temple,
and different gardens. The windows and doorways are all adorned
in ST. JOHN’S WORT (flowers with bright yellow petals and golden
stamens). Beyond the farmstead are vast fields of CROPS.
Most of the arriving crowd is embraced ecstatically by the
welcoming committee. They hug and kiss and squeal with
excitement. It appears to be something of a REUNION. Pelle, in
particular, is bombarded with affection.
Josh, Mark, Christian and Dani stand awkwardly through this.
Josh and Christian notice a towering MAYPOLE. Immense in
height and width, it is entangled in lush green shrubbery and
marked by a wealth of symbols (some runic, some more esoteric,
all colorful). At the top of the pole is a TRIANGLE, beneath
which hang two RINGS.
Pelle brings a beautiful, blonde woman over to the group.
This is DAGNY (25). She wears a white dress with intricate
embroidery (featuring a pentagon and distinct Pagan runes).

33.
PELLE
(in Swedish)
Dagny - this is Dani, Christian,
Josh, Mark.
(in English, to the guys)
This is my sister Dagny. Born on the
same exact week as me.
DAGNY
Välkommen till Hårga!
DANI
(attempting Swedish)
Tack!

JOSH/CHRISTIAN
Thank you!

Dagny smiles and walks off.
An older man, ODD (50s), approaches. He is wearing a dress.
Pelle lights up at the sight of him.
Father Odd!

PELLE

Little Pelle!

ODD

They embrace. There is a moment where they rest their foreheads
together. (Note: throughout the film, the Hårgas will communicate
little things through subtly modulated expressions and gestures.
These are their AFFECTS, a language known only to them.)
ODD (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
How is the pilgrimage?
PELLE
(in Swedish)
Wonderful. Amazing.
(in English)
These are my friends - Christian,
Mark, Josh, Dani...
Odd shakes their hands as Pelle introduces them.
ODD
Hello, hello...yes, hello, welcome.
(to Dani)
Welcome home!
He HUGS Dani.
DANI
(amused, but slightly
weirded out)
Thank you.
ODD
We are very happy to have you! Pelle
has an immaculate sense for people.
Pelle smiles.
DANI
I love what you’re wearing.
ODD
Oh - my frock? Quite girly, no? Ha!
(explains)
(MORE)

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
ODD (CONT'D)
We do this as a tribute: Because of
nature’s, em, hermaphrodite-ick sorry - her-ma-phro-DI-TIC qualities (sighs relief at getting
the word out)
- the men do like women and visa versa.

34.

JOSH
Like the cult of Aphroditus!
(then, remembering)
I think the sakhis saints do the
same thing, too - in Brajbhoomi?
If Odd is annoyed by this, he hides it well. He shines a
tight-lipped SMILE at Josh.
ODD
So! We’re your hosts! Yes? So whatever
you need, you tell us and we’ll do
everything to accommodate! Today is
all festivities, yet tomorrow the
official ceremonies begin. So have
yourselfs ready! It’s a sincere
pleasure to have you, and you are
Welcome-Welcome-Welcome. So enjoy!
They all say thanks and Odd walks happily away.
Nice guy.

MARK

The music suddenly gets LOUDER. Percussion is introduced, and
the music swells to become a regal melody.
Everyone’s attention moves to TEN GIRLS (different ages - from 7
to 13), all dressed in identical white dresses. They hold FLORAL
GARLAND CROWNS (made of mugwort and vervain) and sprigs of
LARKSPUR. They are walking single-file towards a PLATFORM...
Sitting on the platform are TEN OLD MEN AND WOMEN (60s to early
70s). These are the ELDERS. They wear severe or neutral
expressions, and are dressed in finely embroidered linen.
*
The girls march onto the platform. They each stop before one of
the seated elders. Upon a cue, they simultaneously lay the crowns
onto the elders’ heads. They then hand the elders the larkspur
sprigs. After this, the girls return bashfully to the crowd.
One of the elders - a sturdy old woman (70) - rises to
address the crowd. The music drops out. She is beautiful,
composed, elegant. This is SIV, the matriarch.
SIV
(in Swedish)
Happy midsummer, all!
As she speaks, several children - all wearing outfits to
distinguish them as waiters - pass out shot glasses of AQUAVIT. *
SIV (CONT’D)
Ni är så oerhört välkomna hit. Till oss.
Vi vill att ni är med och firar Midsommar
med oss. Ni får boende, mat och vara en
del av det som är den största festen här
hos oss i Hårga. Faktiskt den största på
nästan hundra år.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

35.

She notices the non-Swedish speakers.
SIV (CONT’D)
Forgive me - I’m excluding the ones who
aren’t of Swedish tongue. Welcome to
Hårga, and happy midsummer! I believe
it is the hottest and brightest that
we’ve had in at least a decade, and
this is our biggest party in almost a
century! So - wow, yah?

*
*

JOSH/DANI/CHRISTIAN/CONNIE
(as if solicited)
Yeah. Wow.
Siv smiles, and proceeds to wrap it up.
SIV
All right, my fellow merrymakers.
Without any further blathering let’s raise our glasses Everyone raises their aquavit.

*

SIV (CONT’D)
- and let our Nine-Day Feast begin!
(announcing)
Skål!
Skål!!

EVERYONE

The crowd drinks. Everyone CHEERS. Including our group. The
MUSIC begins again.
On one side of the platform: A young GIRL, also wearing an
embroidered white dress, walks up with a JUNIPER BOUGH in
each hand. She is accompanied by a TEENAGE BOY, who holds two
FLAMING TORCHES. Meanwhile, two of the ELDERLY MEN (72) have
risen from their seats.

*
*
*
*
*

Siv now speaks in English, presumably for our group’s benefit. *
(As she does this, the young girl and teen boy hand the elderly *
men a juniper bough and flaming stick.)
*
SIV
And now, in keeping with tradition:
Hjalmar and Josef will make three
trips. If they make it back with the
flame intact, our vintage will be
abundant this year! On the other hand,
if it burns out - that will be an omen
of bad luck and we will know to
prepare.

*
*

Josh turns to Pelle.
JOSH
What does “bad luck” mean?
PELLE
Usually that the cattle will get sick.
Siv yells something in Swedish to the air.

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

36.

JOSH
(to Pelle)
What did she just say?

*
*
*

PELLE
Told any lingering spirits to go
back to the dead.

*
*
*

The two elderly men, now BLINDFOLDED, begin to run around the *
Main House, holding up their flaming sticks.(Everyone watches, *
rapt.) They pick up the pace to finish their first cycle around *
the house. They then begins circling it again.
*
JOSH
(to Pelle)
Can I takes photos?
PELLE
Discretely.
The men finish their second cycle around the house, and
immediately begin a third. The community seems to be holding
its collective breath. The men FINISH the third run-around,
but...one man’s flame has been EXTINGUISHED.

*
*
*
*

A man in the audience, ISAK (50s), lets out a GASP when he
sees this. Everyone else sinks audibly with disappointment.

*

The men, having finished, remove their blindfold. The elder
with the extinguished torch DEFLATES. Siv gestures sadly to
the crowd: “There we have it.”

*
*
*

Isak looks absolutely devastated. Christian notices.

*

CHRISTIAN
(to Pelle)
Is he okay?
PELLE
The cattle are his responsibility.

*

Isak’s eyes stare off, unblinking. Heartbroken. He looks to
the CATTLE HOUSE, eyes filling with tears.

*

MARK
(to Pelle and Christian)
How do you think he’d react if I just
put my finger in his butt right now?
Continuing the ritual, Siv takes the torches from the men and
walks to a healthy FIRE in a pit. She deposits the sticks
into the fire.
SIV
(in Swedish)
This high my fire, but no
higher, no hotter!

PELLE
(translating)
Uh - this high is my fire,
but not higher or hotter.
(explaining)
It’s to keep the fire from
growing out of control.

Josh WRITES this down in his notebook. Christian WATCHES
Josh, slightly perturbed.

*
*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

37.

Siv now accepts a BOWL OF BEER from one of the children. She
drinks a healthy gulp, and then throws the rest into the fire.
Everyone now APPLAUDS. This seems to be the end of the ritual.
A group of TEENAGERS (all dressed in bright, formal garb)
emerge from a kitchen. They carry PLATES OF FOOD (lamb and
blood pudding) and BEER. They begin by serving the elders.
Dani sees that one of the teens is carrying an ornate platter
featuring a LAMB’S SKULL (brain exposed) and a LAMB’S HEART.
The platter is bordered by a dense spiral of INTESTINES. This
is laid onto the center of a table that has been painstakingly
decorated with local flowers.
PELLE (CONT’D)
That’s a tradition. They just
killed that lamb today.
The servers now move to our group, which has settled onto the
grass. They are handed plates and beers.
DANI
(to Pelle)
Can we help at all?

PELLE (CONT'D)
No no. You’re the guests. Let
yourself be spoiled.

One boy, RUBEN (15), walks up to Dani. He is severely mentally
handicapped and his hands are palsied. He’s dressed in gorgeous
linen.
*
RUBEN
(with difficulty)
Hey hey!

(warmly)
Hello!

DANI

Ruben walks off. As he ambles aimlessly, people reach out to
lovingly TOUCH him - as if in reverence.
PELLE
You just met Ruben.
DANI
Ruben is lovely.
The teens finish serving. They now sit with plates of their own.
Mark has already started eating. Josh NUDGES him. Nobody else
has begun. Mark bashfully sets down his fork.
Silence.
Siv, the matriarch, looks to a PLUMP ELDER (60s) sitting
beside her. He stands, takes a moment, and then speaks loudly
in Swedish, as if in PRAYER.
PELLE
(whispering to Josh and Christian)
He’s giving thanks.
JOSH
For the food?

PELLE (CONT'D)
Yes. And the weather, and the
crops...

The Plump Man finishes his speech, and then announces:
PLUMP MAN
Låt oss äta!

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

38.

Everyone digs in.
CHRISTIAN
Who was he praying to?
PELLE
Uh - well, that wasn’t really
“praying.” But he was just
addressing the...everything. The
harmony and the balance.

*
*
*

JOSH
Can you translate what was said?
PELLE
...I can get an exact
translation later.

CHRISTIAN
(jumping in)
Yeah, please, that would be
amazing.

JOSH
(eyes now burning on Christian)
...Yes, Pelle, thank you.
Christian looks at Josh. A CHARGED moment. They start eating.
32

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

32

A beautiful, curly-haired BLONDE GIRL (16) stands before a
mirror, anxiously fussing with her hair. She clearly needs it
to look perfect. This is MAJA.
33

EXT. HÅRGA FARMSTEAD - MINUTES LATER

33

Maja emerges from the MAIN HOUSE. All the younger Hårgans have
joined hands to form a train of people. They run and dance in
a wide circle, singing a variation of Visa i midsommartid. The
MAYPOLE stands at the center of their circle.
Maja timidly watches the dance, smiling. Her eyes trail off
to find our group. She alights on CHRISTIAN, instantly
smitten. It almost looks like she recognizes him.
One of the dancing boys suddenly GRABS Maja’s hand. He PULLS
her into the train. She LAUGHS as she joins.
MEANWHILE: Our group is still sitting in the same place
(along with Connie and Ingemar). They watch the passing
dancers with fascination.
PELLE
You guys should join!
DANI
I’m too scared.
SIMON approaches, carrying two beers. He momentarily gets
caught in the crossfire of a group of YOUNG BOYS CHASING EACH
OTHER. He finally reaches Connie, and hands her a beer.
Alright?
Simon sits.

SIMON

Ta.

CONNIE

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

39.

SIMON
(re: the boys)
What are they playing?
PELLE
“Skin the fool!”
SIMON
(sarcastic)
Ah. Precious.
Dani notices Ingemar STARING at Simon and Connie. He looks
resentful. He finally averts his eyes and forces a smile.
MAJA, in the dancing train, is about to pass the group. She
summons the nerve to gently KICK Christian’s back. Christian
looks up to see Maja passing by. She SMILES bashfully at him.
He confusedly smiles back.
Dani notices Christian smiling, but doesn’t see Maja (who has
already turned away).
Christian RISES, suddenly feeling bold.
CHRISTIAN
(to Pelle)
How can I join the...?

PELLE
You’re American. Just jam
yourself in there.

Christian uneasily JUMPS IN. He joins hands with two girls.
Josh rises to follow Christian. Dani’s eyes follow them.
Pelle takes this opportunity to turn covertly to Dani:
PELLE (CONT’D)
Hey: very quick:
He hands her a folded up DRAWING.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Happy birthday.
Dani, surprised, opens the paper. It’s a drawing of her FACE
(donned with an extremely lush floral crown). The style is
simple, but her likeness is captured beautifully.
DANI
Oh - my gosh. Pelle!
PELLE
It’s just something I do for
birthdays. Maybe it’s not
appropriate?

DANI (CONT'D)
Oh my God, not at all! It’s
wonderful. Thank you, Pelle.
I’m so touched.

PELLE
Anyway. Just between us.
DANI
Yeah, well - don’t worry. Christian
forgot.
Pelle PAUSES, surprised. He doesn’t know what to say.

*
*
*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

40.

DANI (CONT’D)
(immediately regretting)
Or - I forgot to remind him. It
doesn’t matter. Thank you so much
for this, Pelle. It’s beautiful.
She folds the drawing back up.
34

EXT. HÅRGA FIELD - MINUTES LATER

34

The dance is over, although separate groups are still dancing
and playing in the b.g.
Pelle is now leading our group on a TOUR. (Ingemar, Connie and
Simon have joined along.) We track alongside.
JOSH
How do you guys support this place?
PELLE
Lumbering, wheat,
vegetables...

INGEMAR
Water power plant.

They pass a CIRCLE OF CHILDREN, accompanied by a TEACHER (60s). *
They’re carving RUNIC SYMBOLS into smooth, well-sanded STONES.
PELLE
Schooltime over here.
CHRISTIAN
Carving runes?
The Teacher looks up and smiles confirmation.
PELLE
(to Dani)
Then they put it under their pillow
and dream about its meaning.
Dani makes an “ooh” face. Josh makes a NOTE of this.
Christian sees that they’re now passing an old RUNESTONE (on
their other side). It stands erect in an untended field.
CHRISTIAN
Oh man - there’s a serious
one.

JOSH
Oh shit!

CHRISTIAN
Which alphabet is that from?
JOSH
(quick to answer)
Looks like the Elder Futhark.
(to Pelle)
Right? Or is that medieval?
INGEMAR
That’s actually the younger Futhark.
Josh nods “Ah, right” - visibly pained to be wrong.
CONNIE
(to Christian and Dani)
So, how long’ve you two been together?

41.
DANI
Oh, jeez...almost three years now!
CHRISTIAN
(gently correcting)
Uhhh, well...two and half.
DANI
...You’re joking. It’ll be three in
fifteen days.
Christian thinks about that, and grudgingly concedes.
CHRISTIAN
Okay, no, that is true.
(off Dani’s look)
It is! You’re absolutely right.
He makes a “sowwy” face, kisses her incredulous cheek, and
changes the subject by asking Simon, Connie and Ingemar:
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
How did you guys all meet?
They look at each other. “Who answers?”
INGEMAR
Well...we were all working on the same
farm, and funny enough: I was dating Connie
when Simon and me first became pals.
Simon’s eyes narrow.
CONNIE
(correcting)
Well - we‘d been on a date. Which I wasn’t
even actually aware that it was a date.
INGEMAR
(backtracking jovially)
Right, no, I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends - we decided to
be friends - and that was just before
Connie and Simon started dating. And
now they're engaged!
DANI
Oh wow. Congratulations.

INGEMAR (CONT'D)
Which is amazing. Yes.
Congratulations.

Simon and Connie look uncomfortable. They smile “thank you.”
SIMON
(to Dani)
We’ve actually asked Ingemar to
officiate the wedding.
DANI
(excited)
You did?!
Nope.

SIMON

Everybody LAUGHS - including Ingemar.

42.
PELLE
(announcing)
And now...behold!
They have all arrived at a SMALL TREE.
My tree.

PELLE (CONT’D)

CHRISTIAN
Why your tree?
PELLE
When someone’s born, we plant a
tree for that person and they grow
up together. This one’s mine.
DANI
That’s so beautiful.

JOSH
(pen and paper ready)
Is there a specific name for
that practice?

Christian points out a SMALL HOUSE which stands isolated in a
large field. It has been painted a vivid yellow.
CHRISTIAN
What about that house?
PELLE
Ah, that’s like a sacred temple. No
one’s allowed in there.
CHRISTIAN
Looks like it was just built.
Changing the subject, Pelle motions toward the MAIN HOUSE.
PELLE
This is where we sleep!
He leads them toward it. Meanwhile, Ingemar leads Simon and
Connie in another direction.
INGEMAR
Here: come see my tree!
On our group’s way to the Main House, they pass a CAGED BEAR.
MARK
So we’re just gonna ignore the
bear, then.
PELLE
(acknowledging, deadpan)
That’s a bear.
35

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

35

Josh leads our group through the two-storied interior of the
huge, barn-shaped house. There is a large, square HOLE in the
floor of the second story (so both stories are visible to each
other). On both floors, the walls are lined with BEDS. The center
of the bottom story is bare, like a dance floor. A MAP TO THE
COSMOS has been painted on the floor, featuring sacred lines
connecting notable stars.

43.
Pelle points out four small beds.
PELLE
These’ll be yours.
Mark throws his bag onto one of them.
The group marvels at the walls, which are covered in INTRICATE
MURALS. Runic letters abound. The CEILING is especially
impressive. It’s painted to tell an epic story in hundreds of
sequenced panels. At the center of the ceiling is a painting of
the SUN. All stories lead to this (or do they come from this?).
CHRISTIAN
Who all sleeps in here?
PELLE
All the younger ones. Until we turn
thirty-two. Then we move to the houses.
JOSH
Why thirty-two?
Josh has pulled out his MOLESKIN NOTEPAD, ready to write down
Pelle’s answer. Christian (almost in response) pulls out his
phone, ready to type. Pelle PAUSES at this. He then explains,
gesturing to a MURAL that dramatizes the following:
PELLE
We think of life like the seasons. You
are a child until you’re 16, and that is
the Spring. At some point we all do our
Pilgrimage, and that’s between 17 and
32. That’s Summer. Then, from 33 to 52,
you’re of working age: Fall. And finally
from 53 to 72, you become a mentor.
Winter.

JOSH

Josh and Christian have written all this down - their eyes
intermittently piercing each other.
DANI
What happens when you turn 72, then?
Pelle makes a comical THROAT SLASH gesture. Dani laughs, and
begins to walk off.
MARK
Not a lot of privacy. What do you
do when you wanna jerk off?
Now that Dani is away, Pelle crosses quietly to Christian. He
covertly ushers him aside.
Dani has found a wall of twelve FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS. They all
feature a different young woman dressed in ceremonial garb.
In each photo, the woman is richly adorned in summer flowers
and wears an impressive FLORAL CROWN. These photos have been
taken annually for the last dozen years.
Dani looks over to notice Pelle WHISPERING to Christian, who
now looks extremely GUILTY. She interrupts by bluntly asking:
DANI
Who are these of?

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

44.

PELLE
Oh - those are our May Queens. You’ll
actually be here for that.
JOSH
Who are the “May Queens”?
PELLE
Every midsummer we do the dance of
the Hårgas. All the younger women
compete and the winner gets crowned.
Outside we hear:
ODD (O.S.)
(announcing, in Swedish)
Movie in twenty minutes! Field five!
36

EXT. FARMSTEAD - SAME TIME

36

Several Hårgans set up chairs on the grass. A 16MM FILM
PROJECTOR is wheeled in to face a large PROJECTOR SCREEN.
Dani stands on the grass, under a now-overcast sky. An ominous
RUMBLING in the distance. She closes her eyes, breathes deeply
- practicing mindfulness.
She is suddenly distracted by a baby’s CRYING. Dani looks off
to see in the distance...
SEVERAL HÅRGANS are gathered around an OAK TREE. The VILLAGE
DOCTOR (50) is crouched, cradling a CRYING BABY. He directs a
doting WOMAN (50s) to pour some fresh dew (from a vial) into the
baby’s mouth.
Dani appeals to a nearby HÅRGAN MAN (30s):
DANI
Excuse me? Can I ask if you know
what’s happening over there?
HÅRGAN MAN
(looking over)
Ah. Poor little Einar has the, em where the bones are bad?
DANI
Oh no. Rickets?

*

The man shrugs “sorry, I don’t know.”
The Doctor is now passing the baby through a WIDE CLEFT in the
tree. The baby is received on the other side by the doting woman.
DANI (CONT’D)
Do you know what they’re doing?
HÅRGAN MAN
Old cure. Three times through the Oak.
The woman hands the baby to the Doctor again, and he passes the
child back through the cleft. Again, the woman hands the child
to the Doctor, and the baby is passed through one last time.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

45.

HÅRGAN MAN (CONT’D)
Now the healths of the baby and the
tree are - together.
On “together,” he illustratively hooks two fingers.
DANI
Like a - sympathetic connection?

*

The man shrugs, confused. They SMILE at each other and the
man walks off. Dani continues watching the ceremony, until-CHRISTIAN appears behind her, holding a SOCKERKAKA (sponge
cake). A lit candle protrudes from it. He approaches
carefully...

*
*

CHRISTIAN
(singing)
Happy birthday to you Dani turns, mortified.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(singing)
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday dear Dani (I love you)...
Happy birthday to you.
She doesn’t blow out the candle.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
You thought I forgot, didn’t you?
Dani just glares at him.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
You’re not surprised?
Dani doesn’t soften. He finally RELENTS with a guilty smile:
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Okay - I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I
thought it was tomorrow because of
the sun. It’s impossible to tell.
He kisses her. She doesn’t kiss back. He keeps kissing.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Happy birthday, happy
birthday, I’m sorry.
- You should be.

DANI
Fine. It’s fine.
I’m not upset.
- I know I should!

He kisses her again, tenderly. She grudgingly kisses back.
CHRISTIAN
Happy birthday, mouse.

*

She forces a tight smile and BLOWS OUT the candle.
MEANWHILE: WOMEN fill the baby’s tree’s cleft with MUD and
CLAY. They pack it tight. Then the MEN tie a ROPE around the
tree. They draw it as TIGHTLY as possible.

*

46.
37

INT. FARMSTEAD - LATER

37

Everyone has gathered to either sit in chairs or on the
grass. They all face the PROJECTOR SCREEN.
Dani, Christian, Mark, Josh and Pelle sit crossed-legged in the
front. The PLUMP ELDER stands before the screen to announce:
PLUMP ELDER
And now, for tradition and for fun: a
work of antique escapism (aside, to our group)
- and an annual mood-setter, made by
one of our own lost Hårgans!
The Plump Elder joins the audience, and the projector starts to
RATTLE. Before the film starts, Christian WHISPERS to Dani:
CHRISTIAN
Happy birthday.
ON THE PROJECTOR SCREEN: A SILENT COLOR FILM begins. It is
weathered and grainy. The film seems to have been made in the
late 1960s or early ‘70s (shot on a Bolex camera). The TITLE
appears (in Swedish): A Midsummer Romance
The film opens on a beautiful BLONDE GIRL (15) walking through
a field with her friends. They pause to admire a GANG OF BOYS.
The girl fixes on one BLONDE BOY (15). It’s love at first sight.
The group of girls walks over to the boys. They talk.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

-“Hello lads! Happy midsummer to
you.”
-”Why thank you, girls! And a happy
midsummer to you.”

One of the girls looks mischievously to her friends, and then
puts an idea to the boys.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

-”Why don’t you lads come to our
house for lunch tomorrow? We will
prepare a feast and you can be our
special guests!”

The boys look to each other and nod. They agree.
The NEXT SCENE depicts the girls gathering FLOWERS from a
lush MEADOW. They pick these flowers with their left hand as
they walk backwards. We cycle through NINE CLOSE-UPS OF
DIFFERENT FLOWERS BEING PICKED.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

Nine Flowers Picked (don’t forget
the Orpine!), and Nine Fences
Jumped.

The girls jump over a series of SMALL FENCES. This is done
nine times.
The NEXT SCENE reveals the blonde GIRL in her bedroom. She
puts the nine flowers under her PILLOW, and then lies down in
bed. She closes her eyes to SLEEP.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

With the nine flowers under her
pillow, she will now dream of the
boy she is to marry.

47.
The blonde girl has fallen asleep, and a CLOUDY DREAM BUBBLE
appears beside her head. Inside the bubble, we are given a
scene in which the blonde girl is MARRYING the blonde boy. He
lifts her BRIDE’S VEIL to kiss her.
The NEXT MORNING the girl wakes up. She wears a wicked smile.
LATER THAT DAY, the GIRLS are gathered in the KITCHEN. They are
cooking. The BOYS all arrive in the living room. Our blonde
girl says “hello” to the boy of her dreams.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

“Hello! Can I bring you some
coffee while you wait for your
pancake?”

The boy nods excitedly. The girl goes off to the kitchen.
In the KITCHEN, the girl takes a CUP OF COFFEE and sets it on
the floor. She then crouches over the coffee.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

Three droplets of menstrual blood
for the spell to take effect.

Three drops of blood DRIP from between the girl’s legs. They
LAND in the coffee.
IN THE AUDIENCE, Dani and Mark WINCE at this. Christian and
Josh (along with the surrounding Hårgans) are delighted.
ON THE PROJECTOR SCREEN: The girl brings the coffee to the
boy. She smiles mischievously as he takes a SIP.
In the KITCHEN, the girl now props her leg up onto a chair.
She takes a pair of SCISSORS and snips between her legs. She
pulls a few STRANDS OF PUBIC HAIR from her groin.
The girl CHOPS UP the pubic hair into fine pieces. She then
sprinkles them into a BOWL OF PANCAKE BATTER. The batter is
then poured onto a burning skillet.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

Hair from the vulva will complete
the spell.

The girl hands the boy his PANCAKE. He eats the pancake, and
then looks up at the girl. SPIRALS appear in his eyes.
Spellbound, he moves toward her, like a love-stricken zombie.
INTERTITLE (in Swedish):

Voilà! The spell was a success.

The boy and girl KISS in Close-Up. We pull out from the CU to
reveal that the girl is now PREGNANT with a grossly distended
belly. They are surrounded by a huge and adoring CROWD, all
wearing identical clothing.
Fade to white. THE END.
The audience applauds politely. MAJA, however, looks ENTRANCED.
Mark and Dani wear inscrutable grins. (Slightly charmed,
mostly disturbed.) Josh and Christian are BUZZING.
38

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”
The windows have been boarded up for the night. Sunlight
peeks from the edges.

38

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

48.

People are climbing into their beds. There are TWO BABY CRIBS
in the corner, stationed near the beds of women in their
twenties. Both bedframes are made of severe-looking iron and
metal.

*
*

Dani, noticing this, turns to Pelle.

*

DANI
Pretty serious-looking cribs.

*
*

PELLE
For the iron. Keeps away the
“invisibles.” So the babies don’t get
“changed.”

*

Pelle smiles sardonically, knowing how it sounds.
DANI
How real is that stuff for you guys?
PELLE
(deflecting)
Ah, who knows?
Dani smiles. She looks over to Christian, whose eyes are GLUED
TENSELY to Josh’s notepad as he scrawls “Iron. Babies changed. *
‘Invisibles.’” Christian looks threatened.
Pelle has already climbed into bed.
PELLE (CONT’D)
All right - beauty rest! Tomorrow’s
a big day.
JOSH
And what’s tomorrow?
PELLE
(mysterious)
First of the big ceremonies.
JOSH
So you’re just gonna be weird and cryptic?
Pelle PAUSES, then takes Josh’s notepad. He writes
“Ättestupan” and hands it back.
Josh happens to know that word. His eyes WIDEN. “Are you
serious?” Pelle smiles mischievously.
CHRISTIAN
What’s that? What’s Ättestupan?
Pelle gestures for Christian to keep his voice down.
Christian pulls out his phone and types “Atestupan” into a
search engine. But there’s no internet connection.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Fuck.
(to Josh and Pelle)
What’s Ättestupan?
Josh smugly climbs into bed. This has made Dani nervous.

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

49.

DANI
(to Josh)
Is it scary?
Josh teasingly raises his eyebrows: “You’ll see.”
39

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”

39

Everyone is asleep. Silence, save for the baby’s CRYING.
Dani lies AWAKE. Beside her: Christian sleeping soundly. To
her other side: Mark SNORING.
Dani shifts her weight. She looks over at the wall mural, and
notices an ILLUSTRATION of a HAPPY MAN OPENING HIS WRIST WITH A
SPECIAL KNIFE. He is surrounded by smiling friends, and above
him, a smiling SUN. Dani looks unnerved, but her attention is
suddenly DRAWN AWAY by the SOUND of...
A teenaged BOY and GIRL (clearly new lovers) sneak quietly
out of their beds. Giggling. They tip-toe out of the house,
careful to make no noise.
Dani stares at this. Heavy.
40

EXT. FIELD - MORNING

40

A GOAT-SHAPED STRAW FIGURE. It’s the size of an actual goat
and notably well-crafted.
An AXE comes down to swiftly LOP OFF ITS HEAD.
Then another AXE comes down to STRIKE its body in HALF.
We cut WIDE to reveal that it’s being chopped into clean
pieces by three MEN in ceremonial garb. Onlookers abound.
41

EXT. CROP FIELD - MORNING

41

Farmers BURY different pieces of the chopped-up straw goat
into FOUR CORNERS of a flourishing grain field.
AT THE FIELD’S CENTER: A man pours a bowl of LAMB’S BLOOD into a
carefully hollowed HOLE in the earth. After this, the STRAW
GOAT’S HEAD is dropped in. The hole is then covered up with SOIL.
42

EXT. FIELD - MORNING

42

Near the Main House, several men are setting up DINING TABLES
on the grass. They are laying them out to form a pattern.
In one FIELD, a group of WOMEN collect the morning DEW (in
small vials) from the leaves and grass. They throw a SHEET
over the wet grass. It absorbs the dew, and they WRING it out
into a pail.

*
*
*
*

We PAN AWAY from this to yet another FIELD, where a large
GROUP has assembled for what appears to be some sort of DANCE
CLASS. They stand in rows of ten. DANI, JOSH, MARK, PELLE and
CHRISTIAN are among them.

*

At the head of the class is a THIN ELDER (60s) with an
impressive physique. In demonstration, he lifts his arm and
waves it fluidly, rhythmically, EMOTIONALLY, back and forth.

*
*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

50.

The class IMITATES him. They strive to perfectly match his
movements and emotions.
THIN ELDER
Don’t just copy me. Feel me.
The class continues to mimic his movements. Mark, Josh and
Christian are looking quite graceless. DANI, however, matches the
Elder’s movements with surprising sensitivity. Pelle notices this.
The Elder stops. So does everyone else. The Elder swiftly
affects a DIFFERENT POSTURE. (This time he goes to his tiptoes, one hand curled at his abdomen and the other arm draped
mournfully around his head.)
The class now imitates this. The Hårgas are impressive in their
poise and precision, and Dani is fitting right in. (Josh and
Christian - not so much.) Once everybody finds this position,
the Elder fluidly contorts his body to assume another.
A sleepy Mark has stopped trying altogether. He looks over to a
woman beside him. He smiles at her, but her gaze remains FIXED
SERIOUSLY AHEAD. For the Hårgas, this is a spiritual practice.
A PRETTY BRUNETTE (25) to Mark’s side says:
PRETTY BRUNETTE
(in Swedish)
Try.
What?

MARK

PRETTY BRUNETTE
(in Swedish, smiling)
Try.
Mark smiles, not understanding. He’s SMITTEN. He halfattempts to join in, only to immediately give up again.

EXT. FARMSTEAD - ONE HOUR LATER

43

The dining tables have been set up to form a wide CIRCLE. Inside
the circle, at the center, is a ROUND YELLOW TABLE (representing
the sun). There are no seats for this table.
Half of the community is already standing at the surrounding
tables. The other half is arriving now. Plates of food have
already been placed. No one sits.
Our group (minus Dani) arrives at one of the tables. They gaze
around, trying to understand the etiquette. They notice that a few
lingering GIRLS walk backwards through a neighboring field,
picking FLOWERS.
DANI now appears with a bouquet of HANDPICKED FLOWERS. She
happily presents Christian with the bouquet.
CHRISTIAN
What?! For me?
Ja!

DANI

CHRISTIAN
(accepting them with strained
appreciation)
...Tack så mycket.

*
*

He kisses her cheek.
Now that everyone is stationed at the tables, a BOY runs off
to officially summon the guests of honor...
After a moment, TWO ELDERLY MEN (72), both wearing ornate
golden dresses, enter the scene. (We will recognize them as
the Elderly Men who ran around the Main House three times
with the flaming torches.) They stand with alert posture,
maintaining an awareness of their bodies as they walk. They
arrive at TWO LARGE WOODEN CHAIRS, situated at a beautifully
decorated table with fine silverware and golden plates.
(Every other table seats at least five people, but this table
has been reserved solely for these two.)
Josh mouths to Pelle: “Are those the ones?” Pelle smiles.
The two men SIT. This prompts everyone else to sit.
Mark picks up his fork, only to notice that no one else has
begun eating. Everyone waits patiently. Total SILENCE, save
for the baby who is still crying.
Finally, the two men pick up their silverware and begin to
eat. Now everyone starts eating.
Josh is scrutinizing every detail. Christian scrutinizes Josh.
MID-MEAL
MAJA feverishly carves a small RUNE STONE in her lap. She is
hunched over to conceal her progress from curious eyes.
The two elderly men are receiving lots of attention.
Near Dani, a BLONDE WOMAN (30s) cradles the CRYING BABY.
DANI
(inquiring)
Is your baby okay?
BLONDE WOMAN
Oh, she will be. She has a bone
problem. She is not “mine,” though.
DANI
Oh, I’m sorry...!

BLONDE WOMAN (CONT'D)
No no - her birth mother is
on pilgrimage. It helps them
to detach. The babies are
raised here by everyone.

Dani smiles at this idea. Josh and Christian are also taken by
this. Josh SEES Christian’s excitement, and quietly HARDENS.
BLONDE WOMAN (CONT’D)
(to Dani)
How is your family like?
DANI
Mine? Oh no, mine are...not here anymore.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

52.

Christian suddenly looks nervous about this exchange.
BLONDE WOMAN
“Not here”?
DANI
(now embarrassed)
Ha. Unfortunately not. It’s okay...
Not any?

BLONDE WOMAN

The Blonde Woman has TEARS in her eyes. She looks sincerely
affected by this.
DANI
(reacting)
Oh God, no, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t
have said. We’re enjoying our food.
BLONDE WOMAN
(now worried for Dani)
Am I making you sad to ask?
DANI
No no. I just shouldn’t have mentioned it.
BLONDE WOMAN
Please know we can talk if
you like. Please. I am happy
to talk.

DANI (CONT'D)
(uncomfortable)
Okay, thank you. Sorry. I
feel silly. Thank you.
(to Christian)
Sorry.

Christian shrugs: “Don’t apologize to me.”
SIV, a table over, has been avidly watching this exchange.
MINUTES LATER
Everyone has finished eating. Another HUSH falls awkwardly over
the procession. Silence, save for the wailing baby.
Mark, half-asleep, confusedly looks around. He sees the Pretty
Brunette SMILING at him. Caught off guard, he BLUSHES and
*
smiles back (a little too eagerly).
*
One of the two elderly men STANDS. Clears his throat. Closes his
eyes. After a moment, he begins to SING a wordless, choral song.
Everyone watches, rapt and emotional.
At the appropriate time, the OTHER MAN begins to sing along,
*
softly and awkwardly at first. Soon he rises, singing with
greater projection. When the song comes to a finish, SIV stands
to RAISE her glass. This prompts everyone else to stand. They
all raise their aquavit.
*
A long silence. Siv finally DRINKS. So does everyone else. The
MUSICIANS begin to play their handmade instruments, and EIGHT *
MIDDLE-AGED MEN break into two groups. They walk to either of
the elderly men’s chairs, HOIST them up, and start CARRYING THEM
OFF.
The congregation follows behind as the elevated men are carried
up a hill. Our group JOINS them, confused. Mark lags behind.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

53.

MARK
(to the group)
I think I’m gonna take a nap.
Jetlag and the shrooms...
Mark heads back toward the Main House. Dani, Christian, Josh
and Pelle proceed to follow the community.
44

EXT. HILL - MINUTES LATER

44

Everyone happily follows the elderly men of honor (still
carried on hoisted thrones). They follow a narrow TRAIL OF
FLOWERS up a hill.
There is a FORK in the trail, leading either to the left and
downward or continuing straight ahead and upward.
The elderly men are carried straight ahead, continuing to
ascend the rising hill. The following procession BRANCHES OFF
to veer left. They continue down a slope that leads to a BEACH.
Our group, squinting with curiosity, begins following the
procession toward the beach. But Pelle slows down.
PELLE
Okay - actually: let’s stop a moment.
He holds them back.
PELLE (CONT’D)
I need to warn you before we go down...
(to Dani now)
...because you might not want to.
DANI
Is this gonna be something weird?
PELLE
Uhhh - it might seem very weird, but
it’s a great honor for them.
DANI
...Is this the thing you
mentioned last night?

(smiling)
Ättestupan.

JOSH

PELLE
We’re about to perform a centuries-old
rite that is very important to us and
very beautiful, but also - very far
from anything you have in America.
DANI
(suddenly nervous)
...Do I not want to do this?
PELLE
Well - that’s what I’m saying. You’re
invited to. I just...
(pauses)
You remember I explained the winter
stage of a man’s life goes from 53 to
72? Well, this is what happens when 72
is reached.

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

54.

DANI
Okay. And what is “this”?
Pelle pauses, considering his words. Dani grows more nervous.
DANI (CONT’D)
What is Ättestupan?
Josh can’t suppress a smile - anticipating Pelle’s answer.
45

EXT. BEACH - MINUTES LATER

45

The community has gathered on the rocky beach. Tall CLIFFS
loom imposingly. The baby cries in the b.g.
Our group stands to the side, along with Simon, Connie and
Ingemar. Christian turns to DANI, who looks extremely uneasy.
CHRISTIAN
Are you sure you can handle this?
Dani doesn’t know the answer to this.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Maybe you should go back to the
main house? It’s not too late.
Dani starts to wrestle with this, but then:
DANI
No. I need to try.
A HORN sounds. All eyes go to...
SIV, the Matriarch, holds a LEATHER-BOUND BOOK whose cover is
marked by runic letters. In Swedish, she formally addresses
the congregation - like a priest to a parish - before opening
the book. Its scripture is written in runes and unknown
hieroglyphs (the AFFECT language).

*

JOSH
(to Pelle, whispering)
What’s that book?
Christian leans in to hear the answer:
PELLE
Rubi Radr. Our scripture.
JOSH
Can I possibly read that?
PELLE
You would not be able.
Siv, eyes on the page, surprises our group by beginning to
*
SING a wordless hymn. It’s beautiful, yet feels improvised, as *
if inspired (on the spot) by emotions provoked by the text.
*
46

EXT. CLIFF - SAME TIME

46

The two elderly men have been carried to the top of a CLIFF
overlooking the beach. Their chairs are SET DOWN near the
precipice. They are placed beside freshly carved (and
impressively sized) RUNE STONES.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

55.

The elders rise from their seats. They are each handed a
CEREMONIAL BLADE. They stoically drag the blade across their
palms, DRAWING BLOOD.
The men rub their palms together, making their hands nice and
bloody. They press their palms onto their rune stones, both
leaving TWO BLOODY HAND-PRINTS.
EXT. BEACH - SAME TIME
Everyone looks up at the cliff’s peak. Dani is SWEATING BEADS
now, her breathing erratic.
Finally, the TWO ELDERLY MEN appear at the edge.
Rapt silence.
One of the elderly men ANNOUNCES something loudly in Swedish.
JOSH
(to Pelle)
What did he say?
But Pelle ignores Josh. His eyes are glued to the men. Josh
redirects his attention to the cliff-top.
Dani BRACES herself. Her TEETH begin to chatter. She GRABS
Christian’s arm, and then -The elderly man LEAPS OFF THE PRECIPICE. Connie and Simon
SCREAM. The man plummets 200 feet to LAND FATALLY on the jagged
rocks below. Upon impact, a FLOCK OF BIRDS ALIGHTS from a tree.
Our group is shocked into horrified silence. Dani looks like
she’s been knocked out of her body. The birds fly over Dani’s
head, and a sudden rush courses through her.
The OTHER ELDERLY MAN - the one whose torch burnt out before
circling the house three times - now steps up to the
precipice. He also announces something in Swedish.
SIMON
(panicking)
What’s happening? Is he gonna jump,
too? No-The man LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE CLIFF. Connie GASPS. The man
plummets straight down, landing not only ON HIS FEET, but also
on the fresh corpse of his friend. This softens the blow,
preventing the fall from killing him. The man, all broken
bones now, WAILS in horrible pain.
The community grumbles with concern. Everyone turns to THREE
MEN, each the oldest of their respective generations (the
youths, the laborers, and the mentors). They understand what
they must do.
SIMON (CONT’D)
Why did that just happen? We need
to call an ambulance.
It’s okay.

INGEMAR

SIMON (CONT'D)
What’s okay?! CALL AN
AMBULANCE! Everybody’s just
watching!

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

56.

The PLUMP ELDER approaches the three men with a CUDGEL. This
is a long-handled club with a pointed block of wood at the
end. The cudgel is handed over to the MENTOR.
Dani watches, overwhelmed, as the three men (now armed with
the cudgel) stalk over to the dying man. The dying man moans
pathetically, in too much pain to scream.
From DANI’S POV: The men have arrived at the dying elder’s
feet. The mentor RAISES the cudgel, and brutally swings it
down onto the old man’s HEAD. This isn’t a fatal blow. The
man raises the cudgel again, and this time he STRIKES the
elder with enough force to silence him.
The mentor hands the cudgel to the LABORER. He raises the
cudgel and brings it down onto the old man’s crown. The
elder’s leg goes into pathetic SPASMS. Blood gurgling. The
laborer BLUDGEONS him once more. He goes limp, probably dead.
The YOUTH is now handed the cudgel. He delivers two brutal
swings to the old man’s head. The mentor gently takes the
cudgel away from the youth, and they all return to the
community. The mentor hands the Plump Elder the cudgel, and
everyone stands in respectful, contemplative silence.
Dani is GRIPPING Christian’s arm. She is completely shellshocked. Christian turns to Josh; they exchange “holy shit”
looks. More EXCITED than troubled.
Siv bounds over to Connie and Simon, who are in a panic. Dani
trembles, powder-white. Traumatized.
SIV
INGEMAR
Ingemar! Did you not warn
I’m sorry, grandmother Siv! I
them?
kind of warned them.
SIMON
Nobody did anything! Everyone just
watched that!
SIV
Oh my, poor things--

SIMON (CONT'D)
You’re all just standing
calmly around!!

Siv lays an empathic hand on Simon and Connie’s shoulder.
SIV
Oh, mercy - please: You should have
been warned better. What you just saw
is a long, long, long observed custom.
Those two men has just reached end of
the Hårga life-cycle.

*

Siv now looks into DANI’S eyes, but Dani is in a daze. She
seems to have been knocked into a dissociative state.
SIV (CONT’D)
It is a great joy for them, you must
realize. And when I do so, it will be
a great joy for me.
(back to Simon and Connie)
We view life as a circle. Okay? A recycle. One thing falls and another
rises. The first man who jumped: his
name was Olof. Yes?
Siv points to a PREGNANT WOMAN:

*

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

57.

SIV (CONT’D)
That baby, who is not yet born, will
inherit this name. He will be Olof. And
if it is a girl, she will take the name
of our last fallen lady, which was
Dagmar.

*
*

Dani gazes at Siv, who has taken on a strange ETHEREAL GLOW
(like an angel).
SIV (CONT’D)
But instead of growing old and getting
sick and dying in pain and shame and
fear, we’ll give our life - as a gesture.
Yes? A gift. And we will leave this
chapter with dignity and gratitude.
Before it can spoil.
Siv releases Simon and Connie, who are no less fraught. Siv
now addresses the whole group.
SIV (CONT’D)
It does no good to die kicking and
screaming and lashing back at the
inevitable. It corrupts the soul.
INGEMAR
(to Simon and Connie)
I’m sorry I did not warn you better.
48

EXT. FIELD - DAY

48

Everyone is walking back from the beach. JOSH rushes feverishly
toward the Main House. Christian’s eyes are trained on him as
he moves to Dani, who looks destroyed.
CHRISTIAN
You okay, baby?
DANI
(branching off)
I need to not be here right now.
CHRISTIAN
Okay. Good idea. You walk. I’ll
find you in a second - okay?
Dani walks off, addled. Christian ACCELERATES to follow Josh.
49

EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

49

Dani’s walk speeds into a SPRINT. Once out of sight, she stops
at a tree, now HYPERVENTILATING. She tries to steady her
breath, but it’s too erratic. She breaks down into violent
SOBS. These are interrupted by a shrill RETCH.
50

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - SAME TIME

50

Josh anxiously goes through his backpack to find his LAPTOP.
He sits on the mattress as the computer boots up.
Christian enters awkwardly - eyes on Josh. He appears to be
summoning the courage to say something.
CHRISTIAN
Hey dude...

58.
JOSH
Hey!
(excitedly)
Holy fuck, right?
CHRISTIAN
Holy fuck. Incredible.

JOSH (CONT'D)
Incredible!

Christian works up the nerve:
CHRISTIAN
So listen: I’ve been wanting to ask you,
or tell you, or just - mention to you
something I’ve been thinking about...
Josh looks up. He DARKENS with concern.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
I’ve just been thinking, and I’ve
decided...I really think I wanna do my
thesis here. On the Hårgas.
Josh doesn’t react. Christian nervously continues:
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
And I wanted to tell you first, so that
it didn’t seem like I wasn’t telling you.
JOSH
I feel like I can’t tell if you’re joking.
Christian doesn’t respond. Josh becomes incredulous.
JOSH (CONT’D)
Oh my God. I honestly can’t even...
(barely containing his rage)
You know I’m out here doing my thesis,
on midsummer. That’s why I’m here.
CHRISTIAN
Yeah, but not on this community.
Josh’s eyes BURN on Christian.
What?

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)

JOSH
...You knew I was gonna want to do this.
CHRISTIAN
How would I know that?
Did you even know that before
I just told you?

JOSH (CONT'D)
Oh my God, Christian, of
course you did!

JOSH (CONT’D)
You think I don’t know what you’re
doing? It’s actually kind of outrageously
unsubtle. The fact that you’re being
this bald about it. It’s impressive.
It is. I’m honestly impressed.
CHRISTIAN
What the fuck?

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

59.

JOSH
Oh, yeah - “What the fuck.”
(seething)
This is what I’ve been working towards
and you know it. That’s why you looked
so guilty when you brought it up.
Because you know - you know - that what
you’re doing is unethical and leechy
and lazy and frankly kind of sad-CHRISTIAN
Okay, wow, fuck you--

JOSH (CONT'D)
No dude, not fuck me! Find
your own subject - or your
own passion. Because I’m
actually invested in this.
It’s not some glorified hobby
that I’m casually dipping my
feet into.

CHRISTIAN
Oh my God! You are so arrogant! In
case you forgot, we’re both earning
the same degree--

*

JOSH
But we’re not doing it in the same way,
Christian. Okay? I have to hold your hand
through everything. You didn’t even know
how to use J-Stor before I taught you,
and you’re a fucking grad student. I
mean, why are you even in academia? You
don’t care! Which is fine! That’s your
prerogative! Just don’t appropriate my
actual work for your new shortcut!
This cuts Christian like a knife. His eyes are flaring with RAGE.
But he stifles it. Determined to remain collected, he concludes:
CHRISTIAN
I wanna do my thesis here. If you want
to as well, I’d be happy to discuss
collaborating. If not, I guess we’ll
have two separate theses on the Hårgas.
Christian leaves.
Josh sits motionless.
51

EXT. FARMSTEAD - CONTINUOUS

51

Christian emerges from the Main House, extremely tense. A very
pale SIMON smokes a joint near the door, looking very ill. He
notices Christian’s demeanor...
SIMON
You traumatized too, mate?
CHRISTIAN
(still fuming)
What? Oh. Yeah...
SIMON
(offering joint)
You want some? It’s laced with
hydrocodone.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

60.

Christian notices in the FIELD: a group of WOMEN collecting
Linum usitatissimum (FLAX), which is in abundance. Among thme *
he sees MAJA, working with her friend ULLA (28). They laugh as *
they work.
*
Christian gestures “excuse me” to Simon, and approaches Maja.
CHRISTIAN
Hey. Hi. Sorry to bother you...
Maja looks up - not understanding. She looks almost panicked.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
I’m Christian.
Ulla insert herself:
YOUNG WOMAN
Hello. I am Ulla. She is Maja.
CHRISTIAN
Hi Ulla. Maja. I was wondering if I
could ask, uh (pulls out pen and paper)
- how many of those Attestupans you
guys have seen performed.
ULLA
Every time one reaches age.

Okay...

CHRISTIAN

So lots.

ULLA (CONT'D)

CHRISTIAN
Right. Okay. And you don’t have like, a
typical mourning period? For grieving?
ULLA
We grieve and celebrate.
Maja has been staring at Christian, love-stricken. He is
aware of it, but tries to ignore.
ULLA (CONT’D)
We must go now and keep working.
CHRISTIAN
Okay. No problem. Thank you. I
might find you to ask more later?
Ulla smiles “okay” and walks off with Maja. They wave goodbye.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Goodbye.
(to Maja)
‘Bye Maja.
Maja smiles timidly and waves again.
In the b.g., Josh stands at the Main House’s door, STARING.
52

EXT. MEADOW - “EVENING”

52

Dani sits cross-legged near the river. Her eyes are closed.
She’s trying to meditate, but her breathing is still unstable.

61.
Christian appears behind her.
Hey.

CHRISTIAN

Dani’s eyes open with a start. She turns to him.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
How we doing?
DANI
I can’t stop fucking shaking and my
teeth keep chattering.
CHRISTIAN
I can imagine. Today was a
lot.

DANI (CONT'D)
I feel like the neck on my
skin is getting tighter. Like
I’m choking.

Dani pulls at her neck. Christian puts a hand on her shoulder.
CHRISTIAN
You okay, baby?
DANI
(looking up at him)
Are you just not at all disturbed
by what happened?
CHRISTIAN
I mean, of course, it was shocking. But
I’m also trying to keep an open mind.
Dani just stares at him.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
It’s - cultural. We put our elderly
in nursing homes. I’m sure they
find that disturbing.
Dani EYES him, disturbed by his nonchalance. She then sees...
In the b.g., a congregation of WOMEN are migrating off together.
DAGNY, whom we met earlier, splits from the group to RUN over
to Dani and Christian.
DAGNY
Dani! Do you like to join us?
DANI
Why? What’s happening?
DAGNY
A special ceremony - for the womans.
(to Christian)
The mans are joining for a meditate. At the houses.
Dani looks to Christian, fraught. He gives her a “go ahead” look.
Dani looks over to the flock of women and sees an equally
unnerved CONNIE.
MOMENTS LATER

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

62.

Dani uneasily joins Connie in the migrating crowd of women.
They’re approaching a RIVER, which seems to GLOW in the distance.
DANI
Did they tell you what this is?
CONNIE
(shakes head)
Someone better not be jumping off
another fucking cliff.
Dani pulls again at her neck - still feeling claustrophobic in
her own skin.
53

EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

53

All the men are seated in a mass circle for a GROUP MEDITATION
(which hasn’t yet begun). Isolated in the center of the circle is
an Elder. He is the MEDITATION LEADER. (Outside the circle, a
GROUP OF MEN decorate a TREE that has been pulled from the earth.
They adorn it in various FLOWERS and HANDMADE ORNAMENTS.)
*
Christian joins Mark in the circle.
Nice nap?

CHRISTIAN

Mark, eyes elsewhere, leans over to WHISPER:
MARK
That girl over there keeps chatting me
up, but she speaks like zero English.
Mark is pointing to the PRETTY BRUNETTE from earlier.
CHRISTIAN
Oh yeah. She’s cute.

MARK (CONT'D)
Right? She keeps eyeing me.

Christian pauses, and then:
CHRISTIAN
(can’t help himself)
Don’t you kinda hate Josh?
54

EXT. WATER WELL - SAME TIME

54

Pelle stands by the well, drawing up water. Josh appears.
JOSH
Hey. Can I talk to you?
PELLE
Sure. But we’re being called
for the meditation--

JOSH (CONT'D)
Has Christian come to you
yet?

PELLE
...About what?
JOSH
(quickly)
Okay - so listen: And you can
obviously say “no,” but point-blank:
I wanna do my thesis here. On this.

63.
PELLE
Oh which? The nine-day feast?
JOSH
Or - yes, but no: On you
guys. On the Hårgas. And I
told Christian this already,
and now I think he’s trying
to pretend that it was his
idea, so if he comes to you--

JOSH
Yeah, of course, and I
wouldn’t do anything without
their approval or permission.

PELLE (CONT'D)

Okay, well...
Well, no, hey, wait a minute:
I seriously doubt the elders
will approve of anything
being written. They’re
extremely protective.
PELLE (CONT'D)
Yeah, but - they won’t
approve, Josh. The only
reason we’ve survived at all
is because we operate in
total isolation.

JOSH
Right: So I can just use aliases for
everything!
PELLE
Then what would be the point? You
couldn’t even get it peer reviewed!
(before Josh can argue)
Christian did already ask me this, by
the way. I told him the exact same
thing I’m telling you.
JOSH
...I thought you just said he
hadn’t talked to you.
PELLE
(annoyed)
Fuck, look: I’ll ask the elders. Okay?
But if it’s approved, you either both
do it together or you fight it out
between yourselves.
Pelle puts his hands up to signify “That’s it.” He walks off
toward the MEDITATION CIRCLE.
55

EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

55

Pelle walks to an Elder near the back of the circle. He
WHISPERS in his ear. As this happens, Josh hovers in the
distance. He WATCHES Pelle’s interaction, in suspense.
Christian, still sitting in the circle, SEES Josh staring at
Pelle. Christian becomes instantly PARANOID. He RISES.
CHRISTIAN
(to Mark)
I’m gonna - take a leak.
Christian walks off towards a wall of BUSHES. Josh sees this,
hesitates, and then warily FOLLOWS. He keeps a healthy
distance. (Pelle’s EYES are now on both of them.)

64.
Once Christian is hidden by foliage, he sneakily RUNS off. He
pursues the crowd of women, who are off in the distance.
MEANWHILE, Mark looks helpless in the meditation circle.
MEDITATION LEADER
(in Swedish)
We begin now. Close your eyes.
56

EXT. RIVER - SAME TIME

56

The women arrive at the river. Hundreds of LANTERNS have been set
up around the water to resemble a FIERY NECKLACE. In the river’s
center, NINE BURNING TORCHES protrude from a BUOY atop the water.
The women have stopped at a spot near the river. Everyone stands
seriously about. Siv walks up to a mystified Dani and Connie.
SIV
Do you admire the Brísingamen?
CONNIE
The lanterns?
SIV
Glädje’s necklace made by the fairies.
We give it now to her mother, Kärlek, as
praise for creating our sun.
Dani and Connie don’t understand, nor do they inquire further.
Siv laughs, seeing their confusion.
SIV (CONT’D)
Think of it like theatre. Strictly
presentational. Yes?
Dani placates her by nodding. Siv smiles and directs their
attention to the CENTER of the congregation.
One of the female elders - a LARGE WOMAN (60s) with sturdy legs holds the sacred book Rubi Radr. She takes a moment as everyone
quiets down. She then reads a passage (in Swedish) out loud. She
reads with clarity and authority. After she has finished...
A GROUP OF NINE WOMEN (three in their 20s, three in their 30s/
40s, and three in their 50s/60s) all DISROBE. They are now NUDE.
A woman begins playing the KEY-HARP. After the tune is
established, three women begin to SING. It is a WORDLESS choral
song - comprised only of expressive/abstract sounds that evoke a
range of feelings and tell a strictly emotional story.
As this is sung, the nude women walk to the RIVER. They descend
into the water and swim towards the center. The song continues.
The nude women arrive at the burning buoy. They wait for the song
to reach a bridge, and then they each draw a FLAMING TORCH from
the buoy. Holding up their torches, the nude women now step
carefully onto what must be underwater planks. They are still up
to their necks in water. As the song crescendos, they slowly walk
up the planks (each of which move in separate directions) to
emerge from the water.
SIV (CONT’D)
(explaining to Dani)
The women represents the sun. The sea
gave birth to the sun, so they’re like (MORE)

- from the womb.

65.

Dani and Connie watch. It is hypnotic.
Christian, having just caught up, WATCHES this ritual from
behind a tree. Josh, a good distance behind Christian, also
watches. Transfixed.
The women all arrive onto the shore at the same time. They
rest their torches, and the song comes to an end.
Siv looks to a young RED-HAIRED WOMAN (30s), who runs off to
now fetch the men.
57

EXT. FARMSTEAD - MOMENTS LATER

57

The Red-Haired Woman gives a signal to ODD. Odd then gestures to
the MEN handling the decorated tree. They all LIFT the tree, and
one man strikes a BELL. This ROUSES the men from their meditation.
MEDITATION LEADER
(in Swedish)
Now we stop.
Odd addresses the meditators.
ODD
Okay everyone! Let us form a
procession. Following the tree.
Everybody rises, still coming out of their collective trance.
They queue up to follow the decorated tree.
58

EXT. RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

58

The men carrying the tree ARRIVE at the river, joining the
women. The nude women are now dressed.
Christian awkwardly joins the crowd. As does Josh.
After a moment, the Large Woman announces to the river:
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
In thanks and praise, Great Goddess, we
bestow upon you this modest gift.
Music is played as the men HOIST up the lavish tree, run it
towards the river, and HURL it into the water. The river
gulps the tree down.
A horn bellows.
A THIN MAN (40s) steps out to announce, quite theatrically:
THIN MAN
(in Swedish)
Oh no! Did you hear that rumbling?
I think she is still hungry.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
I heard no rumbling.
(to the crowd)
Did any of you?

*

66.
Grumblings all around. The consensus is “no.”
THIN MAN
(in Swedish)
Ah, well - I suppose it could have
been my own belly.
Some polite laughter among the congregation.
THIN MAN (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
But I do not wish to risk offending
our generous Mother.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
Nor do I. Yet we have already given our
finest jewels and most fruitful tree.
What else could we possibly offer?
Then a YOUNG BOY (10) is heard among the crowd.
YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
You can use me!
The crowd OPENS UP to reveal the young boy. He is adorned in
the same jewels and flowers as the tree. His costume is an
imitation of the tree’s. He is clearly reciting lines (with
less confidence than the Thin Man and Large Woman).
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
You, young Ame, wish to offer your
life to our beloved Goddess?
YOUNG BOY
(in Swedish)
If She will have it.
THIN MAN
(in Swedish)
How brave you are, little Ame!
YOUNG BOY
(in Swedish)
Brave? What is brave in going home?
Horns are played as the Young Boy steps forward to stand
before the men who tossed the tree. They reluctantly lift the
boy up and carry him to the river.
Dani starts to PANIC.
DANI
(to Siv)
No. What’s happening?
Siv SMILES.
The boy is taken to the edge of the river, and the men begin
to SWING him back and forth. They are preparing to launch him
into the water.
NO!!!

DANI (CONT’D)

This mingles with other protestations from the crowd:

67.
HÅRGAN #1
(in Swedish)
No! Don’t!

HÅRGAN #2
(in Swedish)
Leave him be! He has shown
his bravery!

The crowd erupts into a CACOPHONY OF STAGED PROTEST. The men
stop swinging the boy. After sufficient heckling, the men
RELEASE the boy. He then runs to SIV, bashfully burying his
face into her dress. She pats his head with pride.
Everyone APPLAUDS. The performance seems to be over. Dani
looks completely disoriented.
Connie, who has now been joined by Simon, turns to Siv.
CONNIE
So, is this like a Wiccan thing?
SIV
(confused at first)
Wicca? Oh my dear no! This is about
reciprocity.
Okay...

CONNIE

SIV (CONT'D)
Strictly presentational.

Connie looks skeptical. Dani still looks crazed. She turns to
find CHRISTIAN, who (in contrast) looks very amused.
59

EXT. FIELD - MINUTES LATER

59

Dani has pulled Christian to a secluded spot. She is very highstrung. In the b.g., the Hårgas’ WATER POWER PLANT is visible.
DANI
Please Christian - we need to leave.
This is feeling really wrong.
CHRISTIAN
Okay: look: I know it’s weird. That’s
because it’s alien. We haven’t ever
been exposed to anything like this.
DANI
No, Christian: this is pagan
nature worship. This is
completely backwards. We
shouldn’t be here.

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
We just need to acclimate--

DANI
I don’t want to acclimate! I want to leave.
CHRISTIAN
Baby, I cannot leave right now. Period.
I’m doing my thesis on these guys-DANI
What? Since when?!
CHRISTIAN
Since I decided! Today. Which you know
has been a nightmare for me to figure
out. And I made the mistake of telling
Josh and now he’s competing with me--

Revision
DANI
So let him have it if he
wants it! We shouldn’t be
here, Christian.

But why have they invited us?
And why did Pelle?!

68.
CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)

No, hey - have you even seen
what’s happening here?! This
level of tradition? And
nobody knows about it,
nobody’s written on it - and
they’ve invited us to be part
of it! Can’t you see what a
privilege that is?!
Because Pelle did!
Because he trusts us!

DANI
And why would he trust you, of all
people? You’re opportunistic
anthropology students.
CHRISTIAN
Maybe because we’re
anthropologists. Maybe they
want someone to document
this.

DANI (CONT'D)
Oh my God, are you blind?
They’re performing pagan
rituals out here! People are
jumping off cliffs. They
depend on nobody knowing
about this!

CHRISTIAN
(stubborn)
Not necessarily.
Dani HESITATES, seeing that she’s getting nowhere.
DANI
I want to leave.
CHRISTIAN
Then you can leave. I invited you to
come, and I don’t regret that, but
I’m here for a reason.
Beat. Christian’s eyes are ice cold.
DANI
...Do you not love me anymore?
CHRISTIAN
(momentarily stunned)
What does that have to do with this?
DANI
(almost to herself)
This is the devaluation phase. We've
been in it for a long time now. Next
comes the discard.
CHRISTIAN
Oh fuck - can you maybe spare our
relationship the psychology 101?

Revision

69.

DANI
No - this has been happening for a
long time! You’ve been pulling
away... And I've been in denial.

*
*

CHRISTIAN
(finished)
Oh, please babe - give yourself
some credit. Looks to me like
you've got it all figured out.
Christian turns and STORMS away.
DANI
Oh my -- you’re gonna walk away now??
As he leaves, she cries out:
DANI (CONT’D)
You’re just gonna leave me like this?!
60

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”

60

People are laying boards over the windows, bringing the Main
House into darkness.
Dani enters with sunken eyes. Christian’s already in bed. Staring
at him, Dani walks to JOSH. (She is pulling at her neck again.)
DANI
Do you have a sleeping pill?
JOSH
Sure. Uh...
Josh fishes a PILL out of his bag.
JOSH (CONT’D)
They’re intense, though. You
might wanna cut it in half.

DANI
I just need to sleep.

She swallows it whole.
61

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”

61

Silence. Everyone is asleep, including Dani.
There is RUSTLING heard off-screen. Dani WAKES. She sits up
to see...
Christian’s bed is now EMPTY. So is Mark’s bed. And Josh’s.
Concerned, Dani looks to the DOOR. Mark, Josh, Pelle and
Christian are quietly tip-toeing out of the house. They
GIGGLE. Christian is the last to exit.
Confused, Dani climbs out of bed. She rushes to the door.
Dani looks OUTSIDE to see that the group is now inside the
RENTAL MINIVAN, which is IDLING off. Pelle drives, LAUGHING.
Christian, in the back seat, looks out the back window. HE
SMILES GIDDILY AT DANI as they drive away.
Dani watches this in utter horror.
The diminishing car’s TAILPIPE belches thick black smoke.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

70.

Dani opens her mouth in anguish. An impossible amount of
BLACK SMOKE (the same color as that from the tailpipe)
escapes her lungs, FILLING the frame, and then-We SLAM to a HARSH INSERT of the GORED FACE of the second
Elder who jumped off the cliff. He GASPS wretchedly.
We then PUNCH OUT, wider, to reveal that the dashed bodies on
the rocks are DANI’S PARENTS and her SISTER. We then CUT TO:
62

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”

62

Dani is ASLEEP in bed. The last scene was a DREAM. Her
eyelids twitch as she continues to suffer the nightmare.
We pan away from Dani to reveal that MAJA, several beds over,
is AWAKE. She anxiously fingers a freshly carved RUNE STONE.
Her eyes are GLUED to Christian, who is fast asleep.
Maja climbs out of bed and tip-toes to Christian’s bed. She
crouches to SLIDE the rune stone under his mattress. She then
runs nervously back to her bed.
JOSH, whom we now reveal to be awake, has been watching this.
63

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MORNING

63

All of the beds are now empty, and morning activity is heard
outside. Dani, however, is still asleep.
64

EXT. MEADOW - NEXT MORNING

64

Pelle plants vegetables in the garden.
Josh, accompanied by Mark, approaches Pelle. Watching this,
Christian lingers in the b.g.
JOSH
Hey man. Any word?
Pelle looks up to see Josh. He SIGHS and rises.
PELLE
They said you can do it as
long as you absolutely don’t
use names and the location is
never even hinted at.
And they’re gonna have you
sign an agreement to that.

JOSH (CONT'D)
(nodding, excited)
Okay. Wow. Okay.

Josh can’t contain his glee.
PELLE
And you split it with Christian.
Because he came to me first.
JOSH
Well, that’s -- We’ll figure that out.
Mark notices in the distance: One MAN has climbed to the top
of a TREE to fetch a strange, FLOWERING PINECONE from the tip
of a branch. At the base of the tree is a crowd of observing
men.
MARK
What are they doing?

*
*
*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

71.

JOSH
Gathering...charms.

*
*

The climbing man CUTS the cone with a golden blade. The men
CHEER.
JOSH (CONT’D)
(to Pelle)
Here: can I ask you something?

*
*
*

Josh pulls Maja’s RUNE STONE out of his pocket.
JOSH (CONT’D)
I found this under Christian’s bed.
Do you know what this is?
PELLE
(looking over it)
Love rune. It casts a love spell.
CHRISTIAN walks over. Josh CONCEALS the rune.
CHRISTIAN
What’s going on?
PELLE
The elders said you can do your
thesis as long as you don’t use
actual names or location.
CHRISTIAN
Holy shit. That’s incredible.
Thank you so much.

PELLE (CONT'D)
You’re splitting it with
Josh.

CHRISTIAN
(as if Josh isn’t there)
I already told him that’s totally
fine with me.
Pelle notices Christian glancing over at Maja.
PELLE
I think my sister Maja has taken a
liking to you.
CHRISTIAN
Yeah. I think I noticed.
In the b.g., a COW and a LAMB are being led across the field
by different Hårgans.
PELLE
(raising eyebrows)
You know, she just got her byxmyndig.
CHRISTIAN
Ha. What’s that?
PELLE
It means (smiling at the silly expression)
- “pants license”? When you turn
fifteen, you’re allowed to have sex.

MARK
(pointing)
How ‘bout that one? Is she licensed?
Mark is pointing out the BRUNETTE that he has a crush on.
PELLE
(laughs)
Inga? Oh yes.
Pelle is SUMMONED by a few men struggling to carry equipment.
He goes off to help them.
At the same time, Mark catches the brunette, INGA, looking at
him again. He suddenly feels COMPELLED to do something. He
starts marching in the direction of the climbing men.
Mark?
65

CHRISTIAN

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MORNING

65

Dani stirs awake. Extremely groggy.
DANI
(as if still dreaming)
Christian?
66

EXT. FARMSTEAD - SAME TIME

66

Mark has arrived at an OAK TREE with a particularly large
PINECONE (also bearing a flower) at the top. Its base has
been tied with rope. Mark begins to CLIMB it.

*
*

CHRISTIAN
Wait, dude. Maybe hold off.
MARK
I’m gonna “gather a charm.”

*

Josh and Christian look uneasy as Mark quickly scales the Oak.
As he climbs past a few branches, a BEARDED MAN (40s) is heard
off-screen:
NEJ!!!

BEARDED MAN (O.S.)

Mark FREEZES. The Bearded Man runs over. This is ULF.
ULF
(in Swedish)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! GET OFF! GET DOWN!
Mark, now standing motionless on a branch, looks stupefied. The
branch suddenly SNAPS beneath his feet, and he comes TUMBLING to
the ground. He lands HARD on his ass.
Ulf desperately picks up the BROKEN BRANCH. He then notices that
the tree’s mud-plugged CLEFT (wrapped in rope) has BROKEN OPEN.
ULF (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Oh no no no... What have you done?
People have started gathering around. He appeals to them:

73.
ULF (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Can we put it back on? Can we...?
MARK
What’s wrong? What did I do?
Pelle has run over.
PELLE
What happened?
ULF
(in Swedish, heartbroken)
Your American friend. He desecrated
my tree.
PELLE
(gasps, in Swedish)
I’m so sorry, Father Ulf! He
didn’t know.

MARK
What happened? What did I do?

PELLE
You climbed his tree.
MARK
His tree? So what? I’m sorry.

ULF
(suddenly enraged)
“So what?!”

MARK
What?! I didn’t know!
Ulf is clearly in a fury. He STIFLES it, but his eyes are
frighteningly wide.
PELLE
Here, Mark: let’s just...
Pelle leads Mark away.
MARK
What the fuck? How is it his tree?
What’s even happening?
PELLE
That tree cured him of pneumonia
when he was a baby.
MARK
What? How?! No it didn’t.

PELLE (CONT'D)
He believes it did. And now
his health and his life are
tied to that tree. If it gets
hurt, he gets hurt.

Mark looks over to Ulf, who has collapsed into TEARS. The
Thin Elder speaks soothingly to him.
THIN ELDER
(in Swedish)
We can reattach the branch.
It’s a minor wound. Barely
anything.
Mark calms down.

ULF
(in Swedish)
What about the cleft?

74.
MARK
Well - fuck. I am sorry. I still don’t
understand what I did... Do I apologize?
PELLE
Apologize later.
The Pretty Brunette, INGA, has walked up.
Oh shit. Hi.

MARK

INGA
(to Pelle, in Swedish)
Tell him it’s okay. He didn’t
know. I will talk to father
Ulf.

She SMILES at Mark and walks off.
PELLE
(explaining)
She said to tell you it’s okay and that
she’ll explain to him your mistake.
MARK
(overjoyed)
Seriously? What else did she say?
Christian sees DANI in the distance, woozily looking for him.
He walks over to her, affecting pleasantness.
Hey!

CHRISTIAN

DANI
(seeing him)
Oh!

CHRISTIAN
You get some good sleep?
They arrive at each other. He gives her a peck.
DANI
I’m sorry about last night.
CHRISTIAN
...How you feeling?
DANI
(pause, emotional)
I don’t want us to be fighting, Christian.
CHRISTIAN
Well - me neither.
Christian looks like he wants to say more. Dani waits for it.
Finally, Christian thinks better of it.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Are you feeling less nervous today?
Dani pauses uncertainly at this.
HORNS bellow in the b.g. A ceremony is beginning somewhere, and
all the Hårgans are presently migrating over a hill. PELLE,
standing at a distance, is waving Dani and Christian over.

75.
67

EXT. HILL - DAY

67

ECU of a BABY BULL’S HIND LEGS, tied together with rope. The
rope is PULLED SWIFTLY UP.
ECU of a LAMB’S HIND LEGS, also tied together. The rope is
yanked up.
ECU of a BABY HORSE’S HIND LEGS, also tied. The rope pulls UP.
We now cut to a WIDE SHOT of the top of a HILL. NINE ANIMALS
(lamb, goat, dog, baby horse, baby bull, baby cow, pig, rabbit,
and three tied-together chickens) have been STRUNG UPSIDE-DOWN.
They are all alive. Each of them is separated by about five feet.
The THIN ELDER stands to the side of the line-up. On the
other side is SIV.
The entire community has congregated at the bottom of the
hill. Dani looks very nervous. She turns to Pelle, who
already looks concerned for her.
DANI
Do I want to stay for this?
PELLE
...Maybe you should not.
Dani looks to Christian. He looks very excited. She turns
back to the top of the hill, anxious.
Siv speaks exultantly to the air (in Swedish). When she finishes,
STEADY PERCUSSION BEGINS. The Thin Elder strikes a different POSE
(physically and emotionally) with every percussive hit.
The RED-HAIRED WOMAN, reading from the holy book Rubi Radr, begins
to SING. As we’ve heard before, it is a WORDLESS choral song.
Nine YOUNG MEN, each holding a blade, walk up to the animals.
Simultaneously, they all SLIT THE ANIMALS’ THROATS. The animals
THRASH wildly as BLOOD drains from their necks. (The song has
degraded into anguished snarls and cries.)
That does it. Dani STORMS OFF. Christian is too awe-stricken to
care. Josh, meanwhile, is taking covert PHOTOS with his phone.
Beneath each animal, a narrow CHANNEL has been pre-carved into
the earth. Each channel winds and loops to eventually converge,
thus forming a MASSIVE RUNIC SYMBOL (symbolizing fertility). The
blood pours from each animal to run down the separate canals.
Soon, the blood has co-mingled to fill the carefully-engineered
runic sculpture. It’s horrible and beautiful.
Josh and Christian, briefly joined in their excitement, trade
looks of amazement. Mark looks mystified.
MARK
This is fuckin’ weird, no?
Pelle now goes after Dani, who is speed-walking away.
In the b.g., Simon can be heard saying:
SIMON (O.S.)
What the fuck did you bring us to?

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

76.

Christian looks over at this. SIMON, who looks very scared,
is confronting a grinning Ingemar.
SIMON (CONT’D)
(to Ingemar, aggressively)
Why are you smiling, mate?
68

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

68

Dani speed-walks (with intermittent running) toward the Main
House in the distance. Pelle follows her, glancing over his
shoulder to view more of the ceremony.
69

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

69

Dani enters the Main House, eyes crazed. She goes to her bed
and begins hastily packing her bag. Her breathing is erratic
and she’s pulling at her neck again (as if to loosen the skin).
Pelle enters.
Dani?

PELLE

Dani looks up, teeth chattering with anxiety.
DANI
I’m really sorry, Pelle.
Thank you for inviting me,
but I really need to go. Can
someone maybe drive me?

PELLE (CONT'D)
I did warn you this time. I
know it looks extreme, but we
only do this once every
ninety years. It’s - what’s
the word...?

DANI
I understand that it’s momentous.
PELLE
(that was the word)
Right! Exactly!
DANI
(snapping)
I don’t know why we’re here,
Pelle! I don’t know why you
invited us!

PELLE (CONT'D)

Okay: Here: Sit down.
Please.

He sits Dani down. He plants himself beside her, taking her hands.
PELLE (CONT’D)
I invited my friends because this is a
once-in-a-lifetime thing and I wanted
to share it. Especially with my friends
who I knew would appreciate it, because
I am proud of this place.
DANI
But I’m not an anthropologist. I don’t
have the foundation to understand this.
PELLE
And yet I was the most excited for
you to come.

*

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

77.

Pelle has pulled a special POUCH from his pocket. He draws
something out.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Here: smell this.
He places a homemade sachet (containing a SPECIAL HERB) under
her nose.
DANI
What is it?
PELLE
It calms you down.
She pauses before smelling it.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Go on. Inhale. I will, too.
Demonstrating, he INHALES the herb deeply. He puts it back to
her nose, and she does the same. She’s still trembling.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Isn’t that nice?... I know what
you’re going through, Dani.
DANI
What am I going through? I’m
scared. I can’t breathe.

PELLE (CONT'D)
You’re going through a lot.

PELLE (CONT’D)
I know you are, and I’m gonna say
something now, because my birth
parents are both gone, too-DANI
What?!
(crying now)
That’s not what I’m talking about!
PELLE
I know, and that’s fine, but please...
My birth-parents both died when I was a
little boy. They burned up in a fire,
and I became - technically - an orphan.
So believe me when I say I know what
that is, because I do. Yet my
difference is: I didn’t get a chance to
feel lost. Because I had a family here - where everyone embraced me and
swept me up and I was raised by a
community that doesn’t distinguish
between what is theirs and what is not
theirs. That’s what you were sacrificed
to. But I - have always felt...held. By
a family. A real family. Which everyone
deserves. And you deserve.
Dani looks down at Pelle’s hands GRIPPING hers.
DANI
Christian could walk in.

*
*
*
*

78.
PELLE
He’s what I’m talking about. And he’s my
good friend and I like him... But do you
feel HELD by him, Dani? Does he feel
like a HOME to you?
His eyes are locked intensely on Dani’s. She doesn’t turn away.
PELLE (CONT’D)
My pilgrimage has been fun. New York is
fun... But I also find it terrifying how
people live. As if it’s necessary and
even good to be lost and drifting...and
I haven’t spent one night over there
that I haven’t longed to be back
here...in the lap of the Hårgas.
Dani looks almost hypnotized as she looks into Pelle’s eyes.
PELLE (CONT’D)
Stay, Dani. Please. It will be good...
And I swear we’re all finished
sacrificing animals.
Dani gives a weak half-laugh. She relents. She sits up
straight and wipes her eyes, regaining composure.
Good.

PELLE (CONT’D)

Pelle stands up.
DANI
You’re a very empathic person, do
you know that?
PELLE
Well, our first language here is
strictly emotion-based. So I could
just be using that to manipulate you.
Dani pauses at this. Pelle sticks his TONGUE out, teasing.
Dani SMILES, relieved.
PELLE (CONT’D)
You are very vulnerable, though.
And I mean that in a great way.
It’s very rare. It’s beautiful.
Dani is touched, but tries to hide it.
DANI
(re: the herb)
Can I smell that again?
70

EXT. HILL - SAME TIME

70

The ceremony has ended. Groups are now setting up TABLES for
lunch. As usual, they’re being laid out in a particular pattern.
Simon and Connie stand frozen, traumatized. Simon is visibly
DISTRAUGHT. He stares up at the top of the HILL, where the
dangling, blood-drained animals are now being cut down.
SIMON
Are we eating those animals?

Revision
INGEMAR
Not those ones.

79.

SIMON (CONT'D)
And why not?

INGEMAR
(seeing the aggression)
...Because they weren’t killed for that.
SIMON
So what were they killed for? So we
could watch that shit and clap?
Ingemar smiles. This infuriates Simon.
SIMON (CONT’D)
What the fuck is that smile,
mate? Get it off.

CONNIE
(trying to calm him)
Simon...

This has drawn attention. People are now looking over.
INGEMAR
(gesturing)
We can talk about this over
here.

SIMON
Why didn’t we talk about it
before you took us here?

Ingemar gently touches Simon’s arm to lead him away.
SIMON (CONT’D)
(pulling back his arm)
Don’t sort me out, mate!
The PLUMP ELDER speaks up.
PLUMP ELDER
What’s offending you, son?
SIMON
What’s offending me? Besides the fact
I just saw something I can’t ever
unsee, I’m offended that you’re
teaching impressionable kids to
sacrifice living, innocent animals including a fucking defenseless dog-One middle-aged WOMAN (50s) speaks up.
WOMAN
We sacrificed defenseless animals
yesterday, too! To fill your belly!
PLUMP ELDER
Why are we using “sacrifice” like
it’s a dirty word?
SIMON
Because it’s fucking
medieval!

WOMAN
Why are you swearing?! We’re
not swearing!

The Plump Elder gestures to the Woman to calm down.
PLUMP ELDER
(to Simon)
You’ll find that sacrifice is
essential in any relationship. Let’s
put it in your terms--

*

80.
SIMON
You don’t know my terms!
PLUMP ELDER
(continuing, louder)
Say you find yourself entangled with
a lover who can’t put your needs
before her own.
CONNIE
What’s that supposed to mean?!
PLUMP ELDER
(to Connie now)
Say you learn that your partner can’t
part with even a fraction of his own
comfort to give you what you need. And
show that you’re appreciated.
(to both of them now)
Wouldn’t you start to resent this
person? Wouldn’t your own performance
begin to lack, knowing they’re not
pulling their weight? Wouldn’t you want
to punish that person for taking you
for granted?
(to Simon)
Sacrifice is proof. And without it,
no union can last.
Beat. Simon pops the bubble:
SIMON
Alright. Thank you for that. And now
we’ve seen two people kill themselves
and nine animals get bled to death,
so I think we’re leaving.
PLUMP ELDER
I’ll happily drive you to the station.
SIMON
Lovely. Thank you.
(to Connie)
Let’s go. We’re getting our things.
PLUMP ELDER
(gesturing)
I do need your help jumping the
truck, if you’ll be so kind.
Simon pauses.
SIMON
(to Connie)
Go pack our stuff. I’ll pick you up
out front in (to the Plump Elder)
- what, five minutes?
Fine.

PLUMP ELDER

Connie doesn’t want to go alone. She hesitates and then walks
quickly off. We TRACK alongside Connie, following her away.
As Connie speed-walks, PANIC rises in her. She looks back a
few times, making sure that she’s not being followed.

81.
She arrives at the MAIN HOUSE. Dani and Josh are standing
outside. They watch her storm past.
DANI
Are you okay, Connie?

71

CONNIE
(not stopping)
Yeah. Sorry. We’re actually
leaving.

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

71

Connie rushes to her bed. She starts throwing her things into
her suitcase.
72

EXT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

72

Connie stops outside the door, gripping her and Simon’s bags.
She turns to Dani as she waits for Simon.
CONNIE
(anxious)
It was really lovely meeting you, Dani.
DANI
Yeah, it was lovely meeting
you, too.

CONNIE (CONT'D)
Sorry to just leave like
this. Simon’s coming with the
car.

DANI
I understand. I might be right
behind you.
CONNIE
(on overdrive)
Simon went mental. Christ. I feel sick.
(then)
We exchanged emails an’ all that, yeah?
DANI
No. We didn’t.
CONNIE
Oh. I’m Connie-dot-Brahms at AOL.com.
DANI
Connie-dot-Brahms. I’ll write
you.

CONNIE (CONT'D)
Yeah. Lovely. Sorry to just
leave like this.

ODD comes running up.
ODD
Connie! Simon told me to tell you...
(arrives)
Jan drove him to the train station.
After Simon gets dropped off, he’s
sending the truck straight back for you What?

CONNIE

ODD (CONT'D)
- and you’ll meet him there.

CONNIE
No. Why would he go without me? He
wouldn’t do that.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

82.

ODD
The truck only had room for two.
CONNIE
What does that mean? That’s not
real. Why wouldn’t he tell me?
ODD
Today’s only train leaves in ninety
minutes. It takes forty-five
minutes to drive there and back.
They didn’t want to waste time.
CONNIE
So I could have sat on his lap!
ODD
Simon mentioned that, too. We don’t
break traffic laws.
Connie looks to Dani, incredulous.
CONNIE
(to Odd)
They just left without me, just now?
ODD
There wasn’t room in the truck. Yet
it is coming right back. For you.
Connie shakes her head, not buying it. She WALKS OFF, on a
mission to find out more. Odd turns to Dani:
ODD (CONT’D)
Lunch has been called.
73

EXT. FIELD - DAY

73

Lunch time. Everyone is seated at the tables (which are
connected to form a HELIX shape).
ULF, still panicked over the damage done to “his tree,” is
consulting a BESPECTACLED ELDER.

*

ULF
(in Swedish)
It feels like a tingling. Like a
numbness in my arm.
The Elder presses his arm. MARK watches this, very nervous.

*

Farther down the table, CHRISTIAN sits beside a HAPPY MAN (30s).
Christian takes NOTES as he asks questions. Two Hårga women listen
in, smiling. Christian’s eyes keep straying to JOSH, who is also
questioning people. They are now RACING to gather info.
CHRISTIAN
How are roles or jobs assigned?
HAPPY MAN
Well - that’s based on traits we show
as children. For example:
(points to the
bespectacled elder)
He was assigned “to protect,” so he
did his pilgrimage as doctor.

*
*

83.
Christian quickly writes this down as DANI arrives at the
table. She sits next to Christian.
CHRISTIAN
Hey. You okay?
DANI
...Simon left without Connie.
CHRISTIAN
(faux concern)
Really? That’s so shitty.
Christian bluntly returns his attention to the Happy Man. Dani
PAUSES, disturbed by Christian’s indifference. For the first
time, she actually looks scared of him.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(to Happy Man)
Is incest ever a problem?
HAPPY MAN
Ha! Well...the bloodlines are very
well preserved, so - the elders must
approve mates.
Christian is taking feverish notes. Dani watches him with a
new kind of SCRUTINY; a new kind of distrust. As Christian
writes, he GLANCES over at:
JOSH, who is now interrogating an uncomfortable BALD MAN (40s).
JOSH
What about the holy text? Ruby Radr?
BALD MAN
Um...I cannot answer this for you.
You might ask a elder.
74

EXT. FIELD - DAY

74

Lunch is over. Josh is now interrogating the Thin Elder on
the grass.
THIN ELDER
I don’t understand: You want to see it?
JOSH
I wouldn’t even touch.
76

THIN ELDER (CONT'D)
It’s written in our Affect
language. You would not be
able to read it...

EXT. FARMSTEAD - DAY

76

Dani walks idly around, thinking about her exchange with
Pelle (and about Simon leaving Connie). She holds the folded
DRAWING that Pelle gave her for her birthday. As the gears
turn in her head, her attention falls on...
A large KITCHEN in one of the houses. A group of WOMEN (all
ages) collaborate to prepare dinner. One SMALL WOMAN (40s) sees
Dani and waves her over. Dani pauses and then approaches.
SMALL WOMAN
Would you like to help join us?

84.
DANI
Sure! But actually - have you seen Simon?
SMALL WOMAN
Oh, yes, he was driven to the
station. Did you not say goodbye?
DANI
No. I didn’t. But that’s okay...
(mind still racing)
What are we making?
SMALL WOMAN
Meat tarts!
Dani smiles “ooh!” and joins the women. She’s handed an
apron. Another Woman says something to Dani in Swedish.
SMALL WOMAN (CONT’D)
(translating)
She says you’re so beautiful.
DANI
Oh! She’s so beautiful!
Meanwhile, MAJA is preparing a tray of unbaked MEAT PIES. One
of the pies is clearly very special. She distinguishes this
one by laying a special BASIL LEAF on top.
EXT. FARMSTEAD - SAME TIME
SIV stands among labouring men, staring at the KITCHEN
WINDOW. She watches Dani.
75

INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME

75

The HOLY TEMPLE. Josh stands near the altar with the Thin
Elder, who has pulled the Rubi Radr from an elevated pedestal.
He shows Josh the text (written in the graphic Affect language a combination of runes and abstract hand paintings).
THIN ELDER
We describe it like “emotional sheet
music.”
JOSH
What does it say?
THIN ELDER
Well...each runic letter represents one
of the 16 affects, which are graded from
most holy to most unholy. This here is
about Grief. You can see at the end,
however, we have blank pages?
Indeed the last half of the book is BLANK.
THIN ELDER (CONT’D)
This is because the Rubi Radr is a
constant work in progress. Always evolving.
JOSH
And who decides what’s added?
THIN ELDER
Well - this iteration is being
written by Ruben.

Revision

85.

The Thin Elder points to RUBEN, the mentally disabled boy,
who is playing outside.
JOSH
Wait. The...disabled?
THIN ELDER
Since birth. He draws and the Elders
interpret.
He shows Josh the first pages. They are marked by a BABY’S
HANDPRINTS - all in different colors of paint. (Below the
drawings are runic interpretations.)
THIN ELDER (CONT’D)
Ruben is unclouded by normal cognition.
It makes him open for the source.
JOSH
So...what happens when Ruben dies? Do
you just wait until a new baby isn't
“clouded”?
THIN ELDER
Ruben was a product of inbreeding.
All of our Oracles have been
deliberate products of inbreeding.
Josh’s jaw hangs. He hides his amazement.
JOSH
Can I possibly take a photograph?
THIN ELDER
(suddenly alarmed)
What? No. Absolutely not.
The Elder CLOSES the book.
Okay. Sorry.

JOSH

THIN ELDER (CONT'D)
Absolutely not.

A TENSE beat. Broken suddenly by:

*

SCREAMING, outside. They TURN.

CONNIE (O.S.)
SIMON!! SIMON!!

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

78

CONNIE, panicked and crying, backs away from three encroaching
Hårgans (all 30s). They approach her carefully, trying to calm
her down. Connie desperately appeals to CHRISTIAN and MARK:
CONNIE
Please! I’m begging you! I
saw them pulling Simon! I
swear I saw them!

HÅRGAN MAN #1
He was driven to town an hour
ago. We all watched them
drive off.

CONNIE
I’m not talking to you!!
(to Christian)
Please. You have to believe me.
(MORE)

86.
CONNIE (CONT'D)
I saw them dragging Simon through
the woods. He was unconscious.
Where?

CHRISTIAN

CONNIE
(pointing)
Back there. Near the river. Please.
CHRISTIAN
Can you show us?
(to the Hårgans)
Can she show us?

CONNIE (CONT'D)
(crying)
Please.

HÅRGAN MAN #1
Of course. Just please (to Connie)
- calm down. I promise it’s not
what you think you saw.
HÅRGAN MAN #2
(impatient)
And the truck is already back
for you, by the way! You can
leave.
79

CONNIE

I’M NOT GOING WITHOUT SIMON!

EXT. WOODS - MINUTES LATER

79

Connie desperately leads the group (Christian, Mark, and the
two Hårgans) into the woods. She keeps her eyes locked on
Christian, as if begging him to believe her.
CONNIE
It was right back here! I swear to
God. Right over there! They were
dragging him by the arms and he wasn’t
moving and his head was bleeding!
HÅRGAN MAN #1
So why didn’t you try to stop
them? Or follow them?
-So where did they go?

CONNIE (CONT'D)
I couldn’t even breathe!
-They went behind the bushes.
I ran back for help.
(to Christian)
I wanted to find someone!

CHRISTIAN
Which direction were they going?
CONNIE
(indicating)
That way! They rushed behind the
bushes when they saw me.
HÅRGAN MAN #1
(placating)
Okay: I can tell you’re
saying the truth. Let’s all
go in the direction you saw
them. If he’s here, we’ll
find him.

CONNIE (CONT'D)

They’d have already hid him
by now! You’re lying!!

The Hårgan Man wears a false smile, but his eyes BUZZ.

87.
CHRISTIAN
(interjecting)
I’ll go. Okay? They went in that
direction? I’ll go looking.
CONNIE
I’m coming, too.
CHRISTIAN
Great. You and Mark go together.
Okay, Mark? We’ll cover more ground.
Mark nods.
CONNIE
(re: Hårgan Men)
I don’t want them.
CHRISTIAN
They’ll go away.
(to Hårgan men)
Right? Thanks guys. Sorry.
The Hårgan men concede. They begin walking off.
HÅRGAN MAN #1
I hope you find him.

80

HÅRGAN MAN #2
And the truck is waiting for
you when you finally choose
to leave.

EXT. WOODS - MINUTES LATER

80

Christian walks alone through the woods, half-heartedly
searching. He suddenly stumbles upon a vague trail of DRIED
BLOOD, streaked across the grass. Christian PAUSES at this. Tree
limbs groan in the wind.
Christian looks up, left and right. Nobody’s around.
MINUTES LATER
Christian sees MARK in the distance. He walks over.
CHRISTIAN
Where’s Connie?
MARK
She got freaked out and ran back. I
dunno.
CHRISTIAN
(skeptically)
She went off alone?
MARK
She’s fucking nuts, dude. So are
the rest of these people. The whole
fuckin’ place is crazy.
They arrive at each other.
MARK (CONT’D)
Did you find anything?
CHRISTIAN
Not really.

88.
MARK
...I do really wanna fuck that brunette.
81

EXT. FIELD - DAY

81

Christian and Mark return from the woods. They approach the two
Hårgan men, who are now laying a dense CIRCLE OF ROCKS around
the ominous, yellow SACRED HOUSE (which we saw earlier,
isolated in the field).
CHRISTIAN
Did Connie come back here?
HÅRGAN MAN #1
(looking up)
Uh - yes. Her boyfriend called our
landline from the station and they
talked on the phone. Then she begged our
pardon and Jan drove her to the station.
Christian squints with burgeoning suspicion.
CHRISTIAN
Okay. Huh. I guess that’s a relief.
HÅRGAN MAN #1
For her it was. We already saw him
leave the first time.
In the b.g., a Hårgan BOY (13) runs from one group to another,
announcing:
BOY
(in Swedish)
Supper is ready! ... They’re calling
supper!
82

EXT. HILL - DAY

82

At the base of the hill, the dining tables are now set in the
pattern of a STAR. Everyone is seated, save for some stragglers.
Christian, Dani, Josh and Mark sit at a table. Pelle is
seated a few seats away. Dani glances over at him. He smiles
warmly and looks away. Dani’s eyes LINGER on him.
The SERVERS are laying plates in front of everyone. One
especially COY-LOOKING SERVER sets a plate in front of CHRISTIAN.
It features the special meat pie with the BASIL LEAF on top.
Thanks.

CHRISTIAN

Dani turns to Christian.
DANI
Do you know what happened with Connie?
CHRISTIAN
She supposedly got driven to the station.
DANI
Why do you think Simon would leave
without her?
Christian shrugs.

89.
DANI (CONT’D)
I could see you possibly doing that.
CHRISTIAN
...The fuck does that mean?
DANI
(pause)
Never mind.
Christian stares at Dani. Surprised at the uncharacteristic
defiance.
Meanwhile, Mark has noticed ULF staring at him from a distance.
Ulf has murder in his eyes.
MARK
(to Josh)
Fuck. Somebody’s still sore about
“his tree.”
Josh looks up to see Ulf, whose eyes really are trained on Mark.
Yikes.

JOSH

MARK
Is he gonna kill me?
Josh, preoccupied, turns to Christian. He asks, faux-casually:
JOSH
Did you learn anything about the
Rubi Radr?
CHRISTIAN
(mock-delighted)
Oh, what? You wanna collaborate now?
Josh ignores this and moves on to his food.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
I know that one elder showed you
through it...
JOSH
(abruptly)
Yeah, barely. Never mind. Sorry I
brought it up.
Christian seethes. He takes a BITE of his tart. As he chews, he
catches something on his tongue. He turns away from Dani, and
pulls a PUBIC HAIR from his mouth. His eyes widen with alarm.
MARK
(seeing this)
Oh my God, dude. What the fuck?
DANI
(inquiring)
What is it?
Christian turns to Dani.
CHRISTIAN
Just a piece of bone.

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
Ew.

DANI

90.

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Yeah. It’s okay.

Mark leans in to whisper to Christian:
MARK
Was that a fucking pube?

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Shhh! Calm down.

Christian sits “casually” back into his chair. He tucks the
pubic hair into his pocket. He looks around to finally ALIGHT
on Maja. She is smiling at him. Dani catches this.
Christian self-consciously breaks the gaze, taking a sip of his
drink (a pink-tinted MEAD). He then PAUSES, realizing what he *
might be drinking (namely, menstrual blood). Paranoid, he sets
the drink back down.
Mark notices that ULF is still staring him down.
MARK
Jesus. He’s still lookin’ at me. I
don’t like this.
Josh looks tensely at his NOTES. He stares at a line that
reads: Affects -- runic combinations, “emotional sheet music”
INGA, the pretty brunette, sneaks up behind Mark. She
whispers in his ear.
INGA
You will come with me?
Mark turns to her, startled. He smiles widely.
What?

MARK

INGA
You will come? I show you.
MARK
Uhhh... Oh-kay.
Yes?

INGA

MARK (CONT'D)
Yeah. Okay. Sure. Great.

Mark rises from his seat.
MARK (CONT’D)
(to his friends)
I’ll be back, I guess? She’s gonna
show me...
Mark looks very excited as he walks off with Inga. She takes
his hand and leads him toward the woods.
DANI
Somebody for everybody, I guess.
Josh is so immersed in his thoughts, he didn’t even notice Mark
being lured away.
83

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT”
Everybody is climbing into bed. Josh’s eyes, however, are
BUSY. He’s thinking intensely about something.

83

91.
Dani sneaks up on him.
DANI
Hey, can I steal another sleeping
pill? Only half this time.
JOSH
Oh. Yeah. Okay.
Josh fetches her a pill. She takes it and moves to her bed.
Josh crawls stiffly into his bed. He’s still wearing his SHOES.
84

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - LATER

84

Everyone is asleep, except for JOSH, who looks as tense as
before. He sits up, scanning the room to make sure nobody is
awake. He then climbs quietly out of bed. He creeps to the
door and silently exits.
85

EXT. THE MAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

85

Josh rushes across the grass. It’s now darkest twilight. He
hustles to the TEMPLE, glancing nervously about.
86

INT. TEMPLE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

86

Josh passes the dark foyer to enter through the Temple Doors...
87

INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

87

Josh sneaks into the Temple. He creeps over to the pedestal
featuring the holy book RUBI RADR. He pulls out his phone,
turns on the FLASHLIGHT, and begins taking silent PHOTOS page by page - of Rubi Radr’s text.
While he anxiously photographs, Josh keeps glancing up at the
Temple DOORS, making sure he’s still alone. He has photographed
about fifteen pages when he hears the front door CREAK open.
Josh FREEZES. He looks up. Through the Temple’s open doors, he
sees SOMEONE standing in the dark foyer. The person is barely
visible in the dimness. After some scrutiny, Josh makes it out
to be MARK. He is standing motionless.
JOSH
(relieved, whispering)
Holy fuck. Mark?
But Mark doesn’t move or speak.
JOSH (CONT’D)
(whispering)
What the fuck are you doing? Close the
door! We’re not supposed to be here.
Mark still doesn’t move. Despite how hard it is to see, one
can tell that his body looks BULKIER than usual. And his face
seems somewhat SWOLLEN.
Josh looks unsettled. He starts moving toward the door.
JOSH (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Mark? Hello? What the fu--?

92.
MARK steps forward. It is now bright enough to see... This
isn’t Mark. It’s a LARGER MAN, and he’s WEARING MARK’S SKIN
(which is stretched uneasily over the man’s bulkier
features). Upon closer inspection, one might identify these
features as belonging to ULF.
Before the full horror of this revelation can register on
Josh’s face, he is STRUCK against the HEAD by a bludgeoning
FORCE (a block of wood wielded by an off-screen Hårgan). Josh
collapses to make a sustained, involuntary GROANING noise.
A quiet moment as “Mark,” eyes invisible behind the skin
mask, stares down at Josh’s twitching body.
Josh’s body is swiftly DRAGGED out of frame.
88

INT. THE MAIN HOUSE - MORNING

88

Outside, the ROOSTER crows.
People stir awake in their beds. Josh’s bed is EMPTY. As is
Mark’s.
89

EXT. FARMSTEAD - MORNING

89

Breakfast time. Dani, Christian and Pelle look quizzically around.
DANI
Could Mark still be off with that
girl?
PELLE
I wouldn’t be surprised.
DANI
Then what about Josh?
CHRISTIAN
I’m honestly not too concerned.
The Plump Elder stands up. A hush falls cleanly over the scene.
PLUMP ELDER
We have something regretful to announce.
This morning the third book of Rubi Radr
was found missing from the south house.
We are not hoping to point fingers, yet
we ask kindly that whoever took it,
please return it to its original place.
You can leave it in the south house,
which will be left unguarded and
unwatched. Nobody need know it was you.
If it is not returned by tonight, other
actions will be taken. Thank you.
He sits down and everyone uneasily resumes eating.
CHRISTIAN
(under his breath)
Fuck.
(to Dani and Pelle)
Which of you is surprised?
LATER
Breakfast has ended. People leave their tables, carrying
their empty plates.

93.
Christian, Dani and Pelle stand up to see the THIN ELDER and
the PLUMP ELDER walking toward them. Our group anticipates
the following question:
THIN ELDER
Where is your friend Josh?
CHRISTIAN
I know. We have no idea.
THIN ELDER
He and your other friend go disappearing
on the same day. You see how it looks.
CHRISTIAN
Yes, obviously, but I swear to you - we
are completely in the dark on this. We
are every bit as confused as you are.
DANI
(not sure whether to say it)
We did see Mark go off with one of the
girls last night.
What girl?
Inga.

PLUMP ELDER
PELLE

The Plump Elder thinks about this. Christian interjects:
CHRISTIAN
But Mark wouldn’t have done this.
Josh, though: he came to bed with us,
and when we woke up, he was gone. And
if he did take that book, I just pray
you understand: we do not identify as
friends of his, or collaborators, or
anything. I certainly don't vouch for
him and we'd be so embarrassed to be
connected to this in any way.
Beat. The Thin Elder relents.
THIN ELDER
...Let’s just hope it gets
returned.

CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
Yes. I hope that very much.

PELLE
I feel responsible.
THIN ELDER
Well - you and Odd can go looking for
them. Maybe you can redeem this.
Pelle nods, walks to Odd, and they proceed toward the truck.
The Plump Elder turns to Dani and Christian.
PLUMP ELDER
(to Dani)
You’ll be going with the women for
the day’s activity.
(to Christian)
And Siv asks to see you in her house.

94.
CHRISTIAN
(nervous)
Why?
The Elder doesn’t have the answer.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
...Which one is hers?
The Elder points to a SMALL WHITE HOUSE across the field.
Christian nods “okay” and starts toward it. As he walks, he
hears:
PELLE (O.S.)
Grandfather Sten!
What?!

ODD (O.S.)
The truck is gone!

PLUMP ELDER (O.S.)

Christian turns to see a distraught Pelle and Odd.
ODD
They took the truck.
Pelle stares daggers at Christian, and then turns back to Odd.
Christian, very uneasy now, proceeds to the small white house...
90

EXT. FIELD - DAY

90

ECU of a BRIGHT YELLOW-GREEN PASTE. It’s being MASHED
vigorously in a bowl. The paste is made of ground-up flowers.
A fat SCOOP of the paste is dropped into a LARGE JUG OF SPRING
WATER (perched on a table). The paste is STIRRED into the water.
A queue of WOMEN (between 16 and 35) has formed behind the table.
One by one, the women accept a CUP of the water. They drink it
(sometimes after nervous hesitation). In the b.g. is the MAYPOLE.
Dani has joined the line. The BLONDE WOMAN (whom she befriended
earlier) is in front of her.
DANI
Do you know what we’re doing?
BLONDE WOMAN
Oh yes. This is the big one.
The Blonde Woman smiles mischievously. Dani smiles skeptically
back. They arrive at the “water” table. Both are handed a cup.
DANI
It’s just water?
BLONDE WOMAN
Not just. It is for the competition.
The Blonde Woman gulps hers down, and then gestures “You
now.” Dani pauses, and then knocks it back.
BLONDE WOMAN (CONT’D)
(smiling)
Uh-oh.
She LAUGHS and HUGS Dani.

95.
BLONDE WOMAN (CONT’D)
Here we go!
Dani looks very nervous.
91

LATER

91

Three CIRCLES OF WOMEN have formed around the Maypole. The
inside circle (of about 8 women) is surrounded by the middle
circle (about 15 women), which is surrounded by the largest,
outside circle (about 22 women).
The men, children and older women have gathered on the grass
to watch. The LARGE WOMAN stands with musicians (fiddler, keyharpist, and floutist).
Dani stands in the middle circle. All the neighboring women
look very excited.
Dani looks down at the earth. At first everything looks normal,
but then she notices...GRASS has begun to sprout from her shoes.
Dani looks up. Fuck. She’s tripping.
The LARGE WOMAN speaks up.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
It was here, long ago, that the Black One
lured the youths of Hårga to the grass
and seduced them into dance. Once they
began, they could not stop, and they
danced themselves to death. Now, in lifeholding defiance of the Black One, we
dance until we fall. And she who survives
last will be crowned for her stamina.
The Large Woman CLAPS her hands ONCE. The musicians play a long,
sustained NOTE. All of the women join hands and slowly dip to a
cross-legged BOW. The musical note dies. A brief moment of
SILENCE, and then...THE MUSIC BEGINS! (It is the song of Hårgas.)
The women begin to DANCE. The inside circle dances to the right.
The middle circle to the left. The outside circle to the right.
Dani stumbles as she finds her way into the dance. Once she hits
her stride, she smiles. The Blonde Woman looks back at her and
LAUGHS good-naturedly. Dani laughs back!
92

INT. SMALL WHITE HOUSE - SAME TIME
Christian sits in a small wooden chair in the empty LIVING
ROOM. The walls are completely covered in RUNIC MURAL ART.
Christian lingers on a particularly striking ILLUSTRATION
(painted in the wall’s center) in which a BEAR is being
BURNED ALIVE before several onlookers.
A door opens to reveal SIV.
SIV
Please. Come in.
Christian rises to follow Siv into the other room...

92

96.
93

INT. SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

93

A spare room. Two chairs face each other in the center. Siv
takes a seat in one of them.
SIV
Please. Sit.
Christian obliges.
Siv’s posture is perfect. Christian self-consciously corrects
his posture. A long silence, and then:
CHRISTIAN
I just need to say, I have no idea
where Josh went, and I can swear to
that on my mother’s life.
SIV
How do you feel about Maja?
Christian pauses.
CHRISTIAN
About Maja?
Siv’s lack of response says “yes.”
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
How do I feel about her how?
SIV
You have been approved to mate with
her. You’re an ideal astrological match
and she has fallen in love with you.
CHRISTIAN
We haven’t even spoken.
SIV
She fell in love with you before
you came. Pelle showed her a photo.
CHRISTIAN
(pause)
I have someone here with me. I’m
with Dani.
SIV
Dani will not know. I am not
proposing marriage. You wouldn’t be
approved for that.
CHRISTIAN
So...you’re asking me to what?
SIV
I’m asking you if you care to mate
with Maja. It is a one-night offer.
CHRISTIAN
...She’s very beautiful.
SIV
She is very beautiful.

97.
CHRISTIAN
I think I ate one of her pubic hairs.
SIV
That sounds probably right.
Beat. Christian doesn’t know what to say.
SIV (CONT’D)
From an academic perspective, it
would also serve as a unique
glimpse into our sexual rites.
CHRISTIAN
Can I not have a unique glimpse
without participating?
Siv smiles at the silly question.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Can I think about it?
SIV
You can think about it here.
Tonight is the time of alignment.
Then it’s done.
A long, conflicted pause.
CHRISTIAN
I don’t think I can.
SIV
Okay. Is that your answer?
Christian hesitates. He’s very torn.
94

EXT. SMALL WHITE HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

94

Christian emerges from the house in a daze. We track back with
him. His eyes are fraught as he wrestles with the moral
quandary. But as he continues to walk/think, a vague SMILE
sneaks onto his face.
Christian looks forward to see the DANCE COMPETITION in the
distance. He’s walking toward it.
95

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

95

Dani is still engaged in the dance. It’s a dizzying
spectacle, and the mounting hallucinations are clearly taking
their toll on the dancers.
The music STOPS abruptly, and everyone FREEZES.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
Around!
Everybody turns around to face the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. They
switch hands, and the music RESUMES. They now dance in the
opposite direction.
One woman STUMBLES to her knees, laughing. She is now
disqualified. She walks off to sit on the grass and watch.

98.
Another WOMAN pulls out of the circle to RETCH nearby. She is
also disqualified.
Dani, who was having fun, is suddenly disturbed by the
retching sound. She feels sick for a second.
DANI
(thoughts turning)
Josh...?
The Blonde Woman turns happily to Dani.
BLONDE WOMAN
Don’t slip!
Dani looks to her.
BLONDE WOMAN (CONT’D)
Can you holding on?!
Dani gets a second wind. She’s back.
Maja, who is dancing in the outside circle, sees CHRISTIAN
arriving. He joins the onlookers.
Maja decisively feigns COLLAPSE, opting out of the dance. She
stumbles over to the onlookers, affecting dizziness. She glances
over at Christian, smiling at him. He SMILES back. She coyly sits
a few people over. The electricity between them is palpable.
The music STOPS abruptly again. All the dancers turn around,
switching hands. As the music starts again, one woman TOPPLES to
her side, bringing down two of her neighbors. She and one other
laugh; the third woman is furious.
LATER
Many of the women have now been disqualified. Dani is still in
the running! She seems determined to stay alert and compete.
The music CEASES. The women STOP. Their attention is turned to a
field where NINE SMALL FENCES extend one after the other.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
Nine fences jumped clean! Three
ladies at a time!
BLONDE WOMAN
(to Dani, translating)
Now we are jumping the nine fences.
We go three and then three.
DANI
(confused, semi-alarmed)
What?
BLONDE WOMAN
Just watch first.
The Large Woman CLAPS once. Three women - including the Blonde
Woman - walk up to form a row. Standing side-by-side, they face
the nine fences.
The fiddler suddenly WAILS on his fiddle, creating an intense
treble. The women all RUN forwrd.

99.
They JUMP over each fence and run to the next. One woman’s
foot catches the third fence and she FALLS to the grass.
Another women collapses over the fifth fence. The Blonde Woman
makes it to the end. She happily returns, still eligible.
Another three women go. Again, only one makes it to the end.
Next up, two women line up. DANI is urged forward to join
them. She looks to the women beside her. They SMILE at her.
Their smiles stretch wider (and more fluidly) than normal.
The edges of their mouths elongate up their cheeks.
The fiddle suddenly TREBLES. The women RUN.
DANI JUMPS OVER THE FIRST FENCE. She gasps, suddenly filled
with confidence. She runs to the next fence and CLEARS it. She
runs faster now, to the third fence. Clears it. The fourth
fence - clears it! The woman to Dani’s left suddenly BIFFS it,
falling on her face. Unshaken, Dani clears the fifth fence, and
then the sixth, and then the seventh, and the eighth...
Dani makes it to the final (and tallest) fence. She leaps
high. Her foot ALMOST connects with the top of the fence, but
it PASSES OVER! She lands on her feet, triumphant. She glows
with excitement.
The other woman also made it. She walks up to Dani, HUGS her
and gives her an encouraging PECK on the lips.
Dani turns to the onlookers. She sees CHRISTIAN. He isn’t
paying attention. He claps absent-mindedly.
Dani’s expression CURDLES. She walks back to the maypole. Her
trip is turning BAD again.
More women have lined up to jump the fences. The fiddle
SHRIEKS, and they run.
Christian’s eyes go to Dani. She’s staring at him. Taken
aback, he gives her a smile. She doesn’t smile back. She’s
very much in the grip of the psychedelics now.
Dani’s HANDS are taken by women on either side of her.
Confused, she looks around to see that she is now part of a
more modest circle surrounding the maypole. Only SEVEN women
remain. The music STARTS and they commence dancing.
MEANWHILE, Christian sits among the onlookers. He’s sneaking
obsessive glances at Maja. Suddenly, he notices ULLA (whom he
met earlier) walking toward him. She arrives at his feet,
holding out the CUP of the flower-spiked water.
For you.

ULLA

CHRISTIAN
What is it?
ULLA
Spring water with special properties.
CHRISTIAN
(skeptical)
What’s it do?

100.
ULLA
Breaks down your defenses and opens
you for the influence.
CHRISTIAN
...I’m worried I’ll have a bad trip.
Christian looks back to Maja. She’s now looking directly at him.
Her eyes are languid, confident. She doesn’t break the gaze.
Christian turns to Ulla, and accepts the water. He sips it.
Sips it again. KNOCKS it back.
Settling into the idea that he’s now going to hallucinate,
Christian looks back to the MAYPOLE. The women are still
dancing in a circle.
IN THE DANCING CIRCLE, Dani’s eyes betray a rising panic.
One SKINNY WOMAN says, as provocation:
SKINNY WOMAN
(in Swedish)
If we stop, will everything keep
spinning?
A SHORT WOMAN replies:
SHORT WOMAN
(laughing, in Swedish)
What if we looked down and there
were centipedes everywhere?
The Short Woman laughs, and then looks down. As imagined, she sees
the ground as a squirming BLANKET OF CENTIPEDES. She SCREAMS in
horror, desperately FLEEING the circle. Another woman has looked
down to see the same thing. She SCREAMS too, and runs off.
Dani looks down, panicked and confused. It’s just the earth
beneath her feet.
DANI
There’s nothing there.
Dani looks up. She laughs with relief, still confused.
BLONDE WOMAN
(smiling)
That’s right! Hold on to your brain!
Now there are only five women dancing.
TIME-LAPSE. The shadows of the dancing women crawl across the
grass, moving in accordance with the drifting sun. Two women FALL
(to be disqualified) over the course of this time lapse.
Now, only Dani and two other women are in the running. One of
these is the Blonde Woman. The other is a good-natured Plump
Woman. They each dance separately, no longer holding hands.
The Plump Woman’s legs are clearly less stable than Dani’s or
the Blonde Woman’s, and she is tired and stumbling.
Competition has been growing in Dani. She’s so close to
winning that she can now taste it.
The Blonde Woman turns happily to Dani.

101.
BLONDE WOMAN (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Are you tired?!
Dani, still dancing:
DANI
I don’t speak Swedish!
BLONDE WOMAN
(not understanding)
What?!
Dani repeats herself, but it comes out as:
DANI
Aewobeemeewish!
The Blonde Woman, understanding, responds:
BLONDE WOMAN
Waweroobeeny!
DANI
(somehow understanding)
Aewabeeny-sa-aewonnerstabloo!
They are speaking complete gibberish, but they understand
each other perfectly. Dani is amazed.
DANI (CONT’D)
(excitedly remarking on this)
Weerabbleeishcobleraymib!
The Blonde Woman nods manically, agreeing with this.
BLONDE WOMAN
Blorishcobleraymib-wonnerstablee!
The Plump Woman suddenly TRIPS over one foot to fall CRASHING to
the ground. The Blonde Woman (still facing Dani) TRIPS over the
Plump Woman. She COLLAPSES, laughing merrily on the way down.
Dani dances past the fallen women. She doesn’t immediately
realize that she’s just won the competition. She still looks
determined as she continues dancing manically around the maypole.
Cheering women rush over to congratulate Dani, but she KEEPS
DANCING in the circle, afraid that it’s a trick.
The women tug excitedly at Dani’s arms. They embrace her. Dani
decelerates, but does not cease dancing. Finally, enough women
have enfolded her. Her dancing feet slow to a confused halt.
LARGE WOMAN
(in Swedish)
We have our May Queen!!
The LARGE WOMAN approaches with an immense, gorgeously
crafted GARLAND CROWN. She lays it on Dani’s head.
DANI
(hallucinating)
It’s over?

102.
LARGE WOMAN
You are our May Queen.
DANI
(confused)
Why? Me?
You!

LARGE WOMAN

DANI
(suddenly scared)
What do you mean?!
ROSE PETALS are fired out of small air cannons by children.
The petals rain down on Dani and the surrounding Hårgans.
Dani, severely disoriented, is led aside by several women. One
woman wraps her in a sort of scarf (composed only of greenery
and flora), and then she is directed to stand before a gorgeous
view of the field. Her distracted attention is pointed to a MAN
holding a large, old FILM CAMERA. He takes Dani’s PHOTOGRAPH.
Dani looks for Christian, who stands among the Hårgans with a
baffled expression. Dani alights on him.
DANI (CONT’D)
What’s happening?!
But Christian doesn’t understand it himself. He shakes his
head to say “I don’t know!”
DANI (CONT’D)
(pleadingly, to the
surrounding women)
What does this mean? What do I have
to do?
The women answer with hugs, warm smiles, and kisses on the
cheek. Their faces morph subtly (a product of the psychedelics).
Among the people who kiss her are her MOTHER and FATHER and
SISTER (Terri). She looks back for them, but they have
disappeared. A figment of her imagination?
Caught in the hallucination, Dani falls into a traumatized daze.
PELLE breaks the spell by giving Dani an enthusiastic hug.
PELLE
Holy cow, you won! May Queen!
He gives her a blunt KISS on the lips. Before she can react,
Pelle is replaced by two new women, also kissing and hugging her.
Dani is then led to a ROUND WOODEN PLANK (painted gold and
shaped like a cartoon SUN) with eight long, protruding
handles. She is directed to STAND on it.
Careful!

BLONDE WOMAN

The handles are gripped by eight men, and Dani is swiftly
HOISTED UP. She almost falls, but doesn’t. She is elevated five
feet above the ground as the crowd erupts into mirthful SONG.
The song persists as Dani, still on her pedestal, is carried
across the field. All eyes are on her. Everyone follows her.

103.
DANI
(searching)
Christian?!
But Christian has lagged to the back of the crowd. He looks
extremely conflicted. His eyes move to Maja, whose eyes are
TRAINED on him. She smiles widely, but her eyes are faded.
Christian slows to a stop as the procession continues. Ulla
runs back to fetch him. She takes his hand and pulls him back
toward the crowd.
Meanwhile, Dani’s confusion and fear is beginning to subside.
She looks down at the procession to see that these people are
indeed celebrating her. A few women even persist in throwing
rose petals up at her.
Dani, now calm, looks down to see that her FEET and LEGS have
assumed the GOLD color of the plank (like a chameleon).
The crowd arrives at today’s DINING AREA. In a LUSH FIELD,
the tables are all queued up to form a long, straight line.
At the head of the table is a HUGE CHAIR (more like a throne)
adorned in lush greenery and bright flora.
Dani’s pedestal is set down. Members of the crowd step aside to
create a PATH for Dani’s trajectory (toward the throne). Dani
takes a moment before stepping decisively onto the GRASS.
When Dani’s FOOT touches the grass, small SUMMER FLOWERS magically
SPROUT UP around her foot. Her next step is the same. Flowers
emerge, impossibly, from the soil. She continues to walk forward,
having now assumed a more self-possessed posture. Confidence is
rising in her, and with every step, more flowers sprout up. She’s
leaving a beautiful trail of wild flowers in her wake.
Dani STOPS at the throne. Everyone now finds their way to their
seats, but no one sits. They look to her. She looks momentarily
confused, but then understands. She SITS. Now everyone may sit.
Dani admires her green throne. The greenery/flora subtly SWELLS
and DEFLATES (as we saw before, with the mushroom trip).
SERVERS appear with plates. Dani is the first person to receive
food and drink. Her tableware is much finer than the rest.
Before long, everyone has food in front of them. They sit
with their hands on their laps, present. They WAIT for Dani.
Dani picks up her FORK. She looks back to the rest of the table.
They all look back at her with patience. She then looks down and
PIERCES her food with the fork. (The sound of the piercing is
heightened.) Dani takes a BITE. Now everyone may begin eating.
Dani looks down the length of the extended table. She alights
on CHRISTIAN, who isn’t eating. He looks very disturbed,
clearly suffering a bad trip. He looks in Dani’s direction.
They LOCK EYES, but communicate nothing to each other. They are
both lost in confusion, but they don’t share in this. If
anything, they look SCARED of each other.
This moment is broken by a SERVER arriving at Dani’s side. He
presents her with a baby SALT HERRING. The community sees
this and laughs, knowing what’s in store.
For what?

DANI (CONT’D)

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

104.

The PLUMP ELDER explains:
PLUMP ELDER
You must eat it whole, but the tail
going first.
DANI
(sincerely frightened)
What? I can’t. That’s too big.
PLUMP ELDER
(chuckle)
No no - you must try.
Christian, tripping heavily, turns to a LARGE MAN to his side.
CHRISTIAN
How much is happening right now?
Inexplicably, the Large Man CLAPS in Christian’s face. This
sends Christian on an intense downward spiral.
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
(almost inaudible)
Why did you do that?
The Large Man’s attention is now on Dani, whose head is tilted
back as she tries to eat the herring whole (tail first). The
Plump Elder holds it above her, feeding it into her mouth.
Dani takes half of the herring into her mouth, starts to chew,
and then coughs out the rest. This elicits ecstatic APPLAUSE.
Dani, unnerved at first, lets out a childlike LAUGH.
PLUMP ELDER
A word from the May Queen!
BLONDE WOMAN
Yes! Speech!

DIFFERENT HARGANS
Speech!

LARGE WOMAN
Stand! Stand!
Dani is urged to stand up. She does so, clearly hallucinating
intensely. The silence hangs heavily.
DANI
...I don’t know if this is real, or
what’s happening - but...thank you.
Dani lets this hang, and then sits back down. Brief, awkward
pause, and then:
THIN ELDER
To the May Queen!
(raises his aquavit)
Skål!!
Skål!!

EVERYONE

Everyone drinks to that. One Hårgan Woman turns to Dani to
excitedly says:
HÅRGAN WOMAN
You are the family now! Yes?

*

105.
Dani nods, unsure. The woman nods manically.
HÅRGAN WOMAN (CONT’D)
Yes! Yes! You are the family!
The Woman rubs Dani’s arm, smiling warmly (and aggressively).
PELLE, we reveal, is composing a drawing of Dani in her throne.
Christian’s expression is SOUR. He turns to notice that MAJA is
looking at him. Taken aback, Christian’s expression slowly SOFTENS
(in a slack-jawed, lust-stricken way). Maja is clearly “in heat.”
Holding Christian’s gaze, she RISES from her seat (as if in slowmotion) and begins to walk sensually off. Christian watches her
go. She passes SIV, whose eyes are also trained on Christian.
Maja continues toward the TEMPLE, glancing back at Christian
to confirm that he’s still watching her. DANI notices this,
despite the fact that everyone is competing for her attention.
Dani looks to Christian. He stares dumbly at the table, lost in
conflict.
MINUTES LATER
Everyone is finished. Siv RISES. All eyes go respectfully to her.
SIV
Now it is traditional for the May
Queen to bless our crops and
livestock. And after the luck you just
inherited from that salt herring, we
should all be doubly encouraged.
Polite laughter all around.
Siv gestures in the direction of a CARRIAGE, just beyond the
tables. Its roof sports THREE UNLIT TORCHES.
Three GIRLS scatter flowers to create a PATH between Dani and
the carriage. Dani RISES. Everyone else stands up, too.
DANI
Can Christian come with me?
SIV
No. The Queen must ride alone.
Dani pauses to accept this. She steps onto the floral path and
approaches the carriage. On the way, one MAN (dressed in lady’s
clothing) offers her a LONG, FLAMING STICK. Dani accepts it. The
man motions to the carriage’s unlit torches.
Dani walks to the carriage, extends the stick’s flame toward
the torches, and sets them each AFIRE.
The man takes the stick back from Dani, and gestures for her to
enter the carriage. A TRADITIONALLY DRESSED MAN stands beside the
carriage door. He hands Dani a VIAL OF HOLY SPRING WATER, and
offers Dani his hand (for support) as she contemplates entering.
TRADITIONALLY DRESSED MAN
Your majesty.
Dani accepts his supportive hand as she climbs into the carriage.

106.
96

INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

96

Dani takes a seat.
Outside, several YOUNG WOMEN (including the RED-HAIRED WOMAN)
have gathered in front of the carriage. They each take hold
of RODS, prepared to pull the carriage.
A few other women have gathered to the sides of the carriage.
They hold juniper boughs and unlit torches. One girl goes
around, IGNITING their torches.
97

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

97

Most of the community remains standing at the dining tables.
They WATCH as the women pull the carriage away.
Christian watches, too. Guilt-ridden. He looks to SIV. She
looks unblinkingly back.
98

INT. CARRIAGE (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

98

Dani looks out the window as the carriage is pulled through
the WHEAT FIELDS. The accompanying women WAVE their torches
about, casting away dark spirits.
99

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

99

A GIRL begins scattering flowers to create a NEW PATH. This
is between Christian and the TEMPLE. All eyes are now on him.
Christian, frozen for a moment, RISES. He takes one abrupt step
forward, and then continues warily toward the Temple.
100

INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

100

Christian enters the foyer of the temple. The temple doors
are closed. A BEARDED MAN IN A DRESS stands in waiting. He
hands Christian a WHITE GOWN.
Put this.

BEARDED MAN IN DRESS

The man gestures to a MODESTY PANEL in the corner (behind
which Christian can disrobe).
101

EXT. WHEAT FIELD - SAME TIME

101

The women pulling the carriage have slowed to a STOP. Dani is
directed by the Red-Haired Woman to step out. She is handed a
flaming torch, and led to a small HOLE in the ground.
Dani is handed a sack of GRAIN, a raw STEAK, and an EGG. She is
directed to pour the grain into the hole, which she does, and then
to drop the steak over the grain. She does this, too. She is then
instructed to crack the egg and pour its contents into the hole.
The Red-Haired Woman now affects perfect posture. Dani
instinctively mimics this.
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
Repeat now after me.
Dani and the Red-Haired Woman are looking directly into each
other’s eyes. The Red-Haired Woman begins to SING very slowly,
enunciating very carefully, and Dani SINGS ALONG (quite well):

Salmon Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

107.

RED-HAIRED WOMAN (CONT’D)
Vakna upp, vakna upp, både åker och äng
Nu har du sovit länge i din säng
Nu är det över med snö och med regn
Nu har sommarnatten kommit.
The Red-Haired Woman is impressed. As are the onlooking young
women.
The hole is COVERED UP with soil.
102

INT. TEMPLE - FOYER - SAME TIME

102

Christian has changed into the WHITE GOWN. He steps nervously
out from behind the modesty panel.
What now?

CHRISTIAN

The Bearded Man in the Dress holds up a STONE POT. He lifts
off the lid to release a WAVE OF STEAM.
BEARDED MAN IN DRESS
Breathe in.
CHRISTIAN
What does it do?
BEARDED MAN IN DRESS
For your vitality.
Christian BREATHES IN the vapors. His eyes begin to cloud. He
EXHALES heavily. He’s already feeling the effects. His
breathing becomes shallow.
The Bearded Man now OPENS THE DOORS to the temple.
103

INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

103

It is dark, save for several burning candles.

*

In the center of the room, lying on a bed of freshly cut
birch twigs and WILD FLOWERS, is MAJA. She is NUDE, lying on
her back, legs together.

*
*

Several OLDER WOMEN, mostly in their 30s and 40s (a few in their
50s and 60s), stand at the back of the room. They are also NUDE.
Christian is too stoned to react. He regards the room as he
would a dreamscape.
Ceremonial MUSIC begins. A few women, reading from the Rubi Radr,
SING in the Hårgas’ wordless, groaning, microtonal tradition.
One Woman steps up to draw Christian’s gown OFF of his
shoulders. He is fluidly DISROBED. Now standing naked (and
erect), he is directed towards Maja, who waits nervously.
Christian seems to LEVITATE half-an-inch off the ground and
then FLOATS gently across the room (clearly a product of the
escalating hallucination). As he approaches Maja, the singing
intensifies. Maja’s LEGS timidly PART. Christian, now standing
at her feet, looks down at her. Her eyes are closed as she
waits to be taken.

108.
104

EXT. CATTLE HOUSE - SAME TIME

104

The sun is less intense now. It is nearing twilight.
The carriage has pulled up to the cattle house. Dani, holding
a torch, proceeds to bless the livestock (according to the
Red-Haired Woman’s instructions).
105

INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME

105

Christian has descended to his knees. He sits between Maja’s
legs, preparing himself. He looks extremely intoxicated.
Maja’s eyes are squeezed shut as she anticipates what’s coming.
Christian awkwardly leans down to gently KISS her lips. Without
opening her eyes, she kisses back - slowly, sensually. The singing
rises and falls (out of harmony) with trembling impatience.
Christian gently presses himself into Maja. Her mouth opens
in anticipation. He ENTERS her. Overwhelmed, Maja digs her
nails into his back. Her eyes well with tears. Christian
looks unsettled, but he continues...
Christian is now MAKING LOVE to Maja, very slowly - almost
robotically. She lies motionless, mouth agape. She doesn’t move
a muscle, nor does she make a sound, but her expression is one
of total, paralyzed ECSTASY. The singing has now HARMONIZED.
The Older Women watch this with rapt attention. They are clearly
aroused. The lovemaking is dreamily slow. The singing rises
steadily. Delayed percussion accompanies each heavy, lagging
THRUST.
Maja looks back at one of the WOMEN (50s). The woman smiles
tenderly at her. This would be touching if it weren’t so weird.
Maja offers the woman her HAND, and the woman supportively takes
it into her hands. The woman lovingly presses her CHEEK against
Maja’s open palm, CARESSING her face.
106

EXT. FARMSTEAD - MOMENTS LATER

106

The carriage has returned to the farmstead. Dani steps uneasily
out of the wagon, still under the warping influence of the
hallucinogen. The SINGING is heard faintly from the Temple.
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
We shall go now to Siv’s house.
DANI
What’s there?
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
It is a special meeting, only for
the Queens. She will bless you.
The distant singing persists. Dani looks to the Temple. She
seems DRAWN to it.
DANI
What about there?
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
Not for us.
Dani, attracted by the singing, takes a few steps toward the
Temple. The young women look very concerned. The Red-Haired Woman
steps up to STAND IN DANI’S WAY.

109.
RED-HAIRED WOMAN (CONT’D)
I think you should not.
...Why?

DANI

The Red-Headed Woman is not convincing when she says:
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
It is a ceremony for the men.
Dani is now very suspicious. Her expression begs “What is it
really?” The Red-Haired Woman’s expression says that it’s
something that would hurt Dani. The woman’s expression
pleads: “Don’t go inside. For your own sake.”
Dani’s eyes NARROW with paranoia. Now she must enter. She
PUSHES ahead. The women remain where they are, very worried.
107

INT. TEMPLE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

107

Dani enters the foyer of the temple. Beyond the closed doors,
the singing has reached an operatic intensity.
Dani takes a moment to gather herself, and then she bends
down to peer through the door’s KEYHOLE.
Through the keyhole, Dani sees Christian’s BACK as he “makes
love” to Maja. The surrounding women have fallen deeper into
their trance. Dani’s eyes go WIDE with horror.
Stunned, Dani backs away from the keyhole. She suddenly
doubles over and RETCHES. She rushes out of the temple.
108

EXT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

108

Dani runs outside. She VOMITS onto the grass. She’s in a
state of shock. Her breathing is shallow and she looks
anxiously around, as if confused as to her whereabouts.
The young women rush over to Dani. They surround her, touching
her, rubbing her. Dani CAN’T BREATHE. She’s panicking.
The Red-Haired Woman directs the women to LEAD Dani to the
Main House. They all hurriedly guide her in that direction.
109

INT. MAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

109

The young women usher Dani to her bed. They sit her down,
gathering intimately around her. Dani struggles increasingly to
breathe.
The Red-Haired Woman HOLDS Dani’s FACE in her hands. She
locks eyes with Dani and affects DEEP BREATHING. Dani’s eyes,
unwilling to settle at first, gradually become FIXED to the
Woman’s. The Woman continues to affect deep, measured
breathing. Dani struggles to follow her. Her breathing
trembles to meet the Red-Haired Woman’s example.
Finally, Dani BREAKS DOWN into tears. Everything she’s bottled
up, all the emotions that she’s labored to stifle - it all
comes BURSTING out. She falls into deep, anguished SOBS.
Still locked onto Dani’s gaze, the Red-Haired Woman also breaks
down. She SOBS DEEPLY along with Dani. They are sympathetically
connected. It’s remarkable, and very unsettling.

110.
The surrounding women have also started CRYING, although not as
intensely as the Woman who has fixed herself to Dani. The crying
is infectious, and the deeper they go, the greater the outpour.
It has become a circle of hysterical, weeping women. They
moan and scream and cry. It’s positively TRIBAL.
110

INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME

110

The ceremony has nearly reached its apogee. The singing has
peaked, and Christian is thrusting faster and harder than before.
Maja, eyes still closed, is in a state of absolute EUPHORIA.
Christian suddenly looks ill. He begins to slow down.
MAJA
(in Swedish)
No. Don’t stop.
Christian looks like he’s going to be sick.
One of the OLD WOMEN (60s) crouches behind Christian. She PUSHES
on his buttocks, urging him to thrust faster. She keeps pushing
and pushing until Christian’s thrusts have gained in force.
MAJA (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Yes. Yes. Fill me.
Christian continues to push until he finally CLIMAXES. The
Old Woman releases him, and backs away.
The singing DIES out.
Christian, motionless for a long moment, pulls out of Maja
and sits on the ground. He looks slightly traumatized. Maja
looks as euphoric as ever. She hugs her knees to her chest,
and gently rocks herself back and forth.
MAJA (CONT’D)
(in Swedish, to the women)
I can feel it! I feel his life
inside me!
Christian looks back to the OLD WOMAN who was just pushing his
buttocks. She smiles toothlessly at him. He’s definitely going
to be sick. He STANDS suddenly, taking in the room with growing
repulsion. He turns to amble dizzily out of the temple.
111

EXT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

111

Christian exits. He looks around, increasingly disoriented. He
looks down to see the fresh puddle of Dani’s VOMIT. This
triggers him to retch. He moves desperately away from the vomit.
Standing at a distance, several isolated Hårgans watch
Christian stumbling about. Christian tries to ignore them. He
walks toward the MAIN HOUSE, but as he approaches, he hears
the CHORUS OF CRYING (coming from Dani and the young women),
and he immediately changes his trajectory.
Christian is now walking toward a HORSE STABLE.
As he passes the stable, he peers inside to notice that the
TRUCK (which was supposedly stolen) is parked inside.
Christian’s eyes buzz with suspicion.

111.
Very aware that he’s being watched, Christian continues
onward. He arrives at a SMALL HOUSE. He opens the door to
reveal that it’s a CHICKEN COOP.
112

INT. CHICKEN COOP - CONTINUOUS

112

Christian enters. He shuts the door behind him. Chickens flap
stupidly about.
Christian tries to regain his composure. As he tries to sober
himself up, a barely audible MOANING is heard. He looks up,
startled, to SEE...
Across the room, JOSH has been chained to a fence. He is
shirtless, his eyes are half-open, and the SKIN of Josh’s
upper abdomen has been stretched OPEN to expose his LIVER and
the corners of his ribs. If it weren’t for his faint moans,
it would be difficult to discern whether he was alive.
The gnarled edges of Josh’s wound have been covered in bird
feed. It’s clear that the birds have been at it. In fact, one
chicken is currently (and feebly) trying to flap its way up
to Josh’s open wound, and one CROW is perched to Josh’s side.
Frozen in horror, Christian stares unblinkingly.
Josh?

CHRISTIAN

Christian’s eyes fill intensely with TEARS. He starts toward
Josh. As he arrives near him, he begins to repeat:
Jo--

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)

Josh’s eyes BURST open and he GASPS wretchedly for air. He is
thrown into violent, gurgling convulsions.
Terrified, Christian turns around to see...
SIMON’S CORPSE, hanging upside-down. His bare feet have been
SHOD with IRON HORSESHOES, and he hangs dangling by the HEELS
(rope, secured at the ceiling, has been tied between the
tendon and the bone).
Christian’s face is locked in an expression of utter horror. He
turns to RUN, only to bump into ODD, whose face is painted
WHITE. Odd blows a handful of BROWN POWDER in Christian’s face.
Christian can’t help but BREATHE IT IN. He coughs out a lungful
of the mysterious dust.
Stunned for a moment, Christian stumbles back. He tries to move
his legs, but they are suddenly FROZEN. Now immobile, Christian
drunkenly COLLAPSES. He writhes into panic, unable to move. His
eyes are LOCKED OPEN.
He sees a gathering of Hårgans outside the door. Among them
is PELLE. Christian looks pleadingly at Pelle. Pelle looks
away with shame.
Odd leans down. With his fingers, he CLOSES one of
Christian’s EYELIDS. He then CLOSES the other. As this lid
shuts, we GO TO BLACK.
HOLD ON BLACK. After a beat, we sharply cut to:

EXT. FIELD - NEXT DAY

A TIGHT CLOSE-UP of Christian’s sleeping face. His lip is
slightly contorted, and his chin is chapped with dried
saliva. A HAND enters frame to gently SLAP Christian awake.
His eyelids do not open on their own.
The hand’s fingers PRY OPEN Christian’s EYELIDS. His lip remains
contorted. He tries to speak, but it’s nothing but vowels.
HÅRGAN MAN (O.C.)
You cannot speak. You cannot move.
We cut WIDE to reveal that Christian sits limply on the grass,
propped up against a pole. He faces an immense THRONE, made of
jagged sticks and enveloping greenery. DANI sits in this
throne, dressed in a beautiful white dress (covered in
intricate embroidery). Her face is painted WHITE. Her lips
painted BLACK. Her impressive FLORAL GARLAND CROWN is comprised
of the nine special flowers and herbs. To either side of her,
the ELDERS are all seated in a row. (Also, RUBEN has a special
seat, whose platform is covered in COTTON, to resemble CLOUDS.)
Dani seems to have detached from reality completely. Her eyes
are somewhere far away.
The entire community is gathered behind Christian. Among
them, MAJA stands happily, wearing vivid red lipstick.
Siv has risen to announce.
SIV
On this, the day of our deity of
purification, we gather to give special
thanks to our beloved Sun. As an
offering to our great Father, we will
today surrender nine human lives.
Christian’s eyes flare with terror. Dani’s expression is blank.
SIV (CONT’D)
As Hårga takes, so Hårga gives. Thus,
for every newblood sacrificed, we
will dedicate one of our own. That
is: four newbloods, four Hårgans, and
one to be chosen by our Queen. Nine
in all, to die and be reborn in the
great and just Cycle.
Siv turns to the PLUMP ELDER. He rises to continue the speech.
PLUMP ELDER
The four newbloods have already
been supplied. As for our end, we
have two already dedicated The Plump Elder gestures to the CORPSES of the two elders who
jumped to their death. These bodies are proudly DISPLAYED
near the back of the crowd.
PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
- and two who have volunteered.
(projecting to the crowd)
Ingemar? Ulf?
INGEMAR and ULF take one step forward. Ulf looks nervous.
Ingemar looks overjoyed.

PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
You have brought outside offerings,
thus volunteering your own bodies. You
will today be joined in harmony with
Everything.
(to Pelle)
And to Pelle, who has brought us new
blood and our new Queen: you are today
honored for your unclouded intuition.
Pelle, wearing a TWIG CROWN, smiles sadly.
The Plump Elder continues:
PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
And now, for the ninth offering, it
is traditional that our Queen, in all
her fairness and wisdom, shall choose
between a pre-selected newblood and a
specially ordained Hårgan...
The Plump Elder turns to a Man standing beside a large BALL
CAGE (as generally used in bingo). The cage holds about a
hundred WOODEN BALLS (the size of ping-pong balls) with a
different RUNIC NAME carved into each.
The Man rotates the ball cage, which then dispenses a single
BALL. The man holds up the ball and reads the name aloud:
Dag.

BALL MAN

PLUMP ELDER
Honorable Dag! Please step forward.
DAG, a man in his late 50s, looks like he just won the
lottery. He takes a step forward, beaming with pride.
PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
And Christian Hughes...
The Plump Elder acknowledges Christian, whose eyes are locked
wide.
PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
(to Dani)
These are your candidates for the
ninth and final offering. We
patiently await your verdict.
Christian tries to scream, but this only results in muffled
moans. His eyes BEG Dani for mercy. Her eyes are GLASS.
The community waits as Dani makes her silent deliberation.
Dani’s EYES settle fixedly on CHRISTIAN. A wave of intense
EMOTION suddenly animates Dani’s face. Sadness, anger, love,
heartbreak... These feelings are finally wrestled down, and her
expression becomes BLANK again. Her EYES, still trained on
Christian, have HARDENED. They narrow pointedly to suggest that
she’s made her decision. The Plump Elder understands.
PLUMP ELDER (CONT’D)
(to the crowd)
The honor has been bestowed on
Christian Hughes, our ninth and most
sacred offering!

Christian’s muffled screams now become hysterical. Dani’s
gaze remains steely and absent.

EXT. FIELD - EVENING

114

CU of a WHEEL rolling across the grass. Tracking alongside this,
we tilt up to reveal that it belongs to a WHEELBARROW. Lying in
the wheelbarrow is CONNIE’S CORPSE. It is soaking wet and its
flesh is grossly distended (from being left underwater). She is
wearing the same outfit (of greenery and jewels) that was used
earlier for the sacrificial tree (which was fed to the river).
Continuing to track alongside the wheelbarrow (which is pushed
by a young male Hårgan), we pull back to EXPAND OUR VIEW. We
reveal that the Hårgan is carting Connie’s corpse toward the
yellow-painted SACRED HOUSE, which was previously off-limits.
It stands in the center of an open field. Its door is now OPEN.
We settle on a static wide of this until a NEW CART is pushed
into frame. We now follow this cart, keeping it centered in
frame. This cart holds MARK’S “CORPSE.” In fact, it is just his
hollowed out SKIN - stuffed with straw and hay.
Peripherally, other bodies are being carted toward the house.
We continue to track ahead, following Mark’s cart INTO the
SACRED HOUSE...
115

INT. SACRED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

115

The interior is completely adorned in greenery. An impossibly
lush mausoleum. In the center is a PLATFORM made of hay.
Connie’s corpse is rested in one corner. Mark’s is placed in
the next corner. Simon’s body is placed in between them.
In the following corner is the corpse of one of the ELDERLY MEN
who jumped off the cliff. He is surrounded by his most precious
belongings (jewelry, books, etc.). His SON (40s) is overseeing
the removal of one of his father’s EYEBALLS by the DOCTOR.
The doctor has effectively drawn the corpse’s eyeball from
its socket. He hands the eyeball to the son.
The doctor then moves to the body of the other elderly man who
leapt to his death. He is also surrounded by his most prized
possessions. The doctor now proceeds to remove his eyeball.
116

EXT. FIELD - DAY

116

The son of the fallen elder has walked to a small HOLE in the
earth. He lays his father’s EYEBALL in the hole, and covers
it with soil.
117

INT. BOOK-BINDING ROOM - SAME TIME

117

A room that is typically used for book-binding. Its walls are
lined with collector’s editions of books.
A DEAD BEAR (seen earlier, alive and caged) lies on the island
table. A deep INCISION has been drawn from the animal’s neck to
its groin. Two Hårgan Labourers pull out the bear’s INNARDS.
After scooping out the majority of its guts, they pile the waste
into a bucket.
Then, with the assistance of two well-built Hårgan men, the
Labourers endeavor to lift CHRISTIAN’s paralyzed body.

115.
Christian is fitted into the bear’s hollowed out carcass.
They start by inserting his limp legs into the bear’s legs.
118

INT. SACRED HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

118

Christian has been secured into the giant bear carcass. The
incision (from its groin to its neck) has been SEWN UP. The
bear’s JAW has been removed, creating a gaping HOLE (down to
its upper chest) through which Christian’s FACE is visible.
Five Hårgan labourers plant the bear carcass in the CENTER of
the hay platform. There is a pole against which its back is
rested. Christian is still unable to move or speak. His muffled
screams persist.
A man dressed as “Víoarr” (god of vengeance) stands before
Christian. He holds the Rubi Radr in his hands.
VÍOARR
(in Swedish)
Mighty and dreadful beast. With
you, we purge our most unholy
affects. We banish you now to the
deepest recesses, where you may
reflect on your wickedness.
Ingemar and Ulf are now strapped to the walls. They are also
surrounded by their most prized belongings. The Doctor stands
before Ulf. He pours a thick, sappy LIQUID into Ulf’s mouth.
DOCTOR
(in Swedish)
Drink from the yew tree. Feel no fear.
The doctor moves to Ingemar, who smiles widely. The doctor
pours the liquid into his mouth as well.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
(in Swedish)
Drink from the yew tree. Feel no pain.
In the b.g., Josh’s corpse has also been placed.
The doctor leaves the house. Now, THREE HÅRGAN MEN enter with
FLAMING TORCHES. Music begins outside, including the
wordless, microtonal SINGING we’ve come to recognize.
The men approach Christian, whose “screaming” has become
horribly frenzied.
The men move to different sides of the hay platform. They
form a TRIANGLE. Simultaneously, they touch their torches to
the hay - igniting a FIRE.
119

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

119

The torch-men exit the house. Inside, the fire has begun to
spread along the platform.
The music rises as the fire picks up. The SINGING, which wavers
in trembling anticipation, has not yet found harmony.
Dani watches this with dissociated eyes. She stands tensely
in the field, eyes locked on the fire. Behind her, all of
Hårga is enraptured.

INT. SACRED HOUSE - SAME TIME

120

The fire has grown considerably. Inside the bear, Christian
is now being steam-boiled in the animal’s fluids.
The bear’s FUR begins to catch fire. Before long, the whole
animal is swallowed in the blaze. Christian’s wretched face
becomes invisible behind the flames.
Ulf and Ingemar (still smiling) watch this with detached
fascination.
The fire has now spread to other piles of hay. It has begun
to crawl up the walls of the house.
Ulf is suddenly consumed by flames. He SCREAMS!
121

EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

121

Ulf’s screams are heard from the Sacred House. Suddenly, every
member of the Hårgan community (who is not singing) begins to
SCREAM as well. Feeling Ulf’s pain, they emit a horrible chorus
of wails. When Ulf’s screams die down, so do theirs.
Meanwhile, Ruben has been given paper to PAINT on. Two elders
encourage him.
DANI, watching the burning house with fraught eyes, is suddenly
met with a wave of conflicting emotions. Her expression curdles
into one of sheer HORROR and DISGUST. Then it becomes one of
deep SORROW and SHAME. Her eyes well with tears. The singing
has now HARMONIZED and has risen to an insane, operatic pitch.
We cut to an immense WIDE. Dani’s back is in the f.g. and the
burning house is in the b.g. Overcome, Dani buries her face in
her hands. Breaking into gentle sobs, she begins to walk
aimlessly to the side. We TRACK alongside her, keeping her
centered. She is circling the house, pulling at her hair and face
in increasing anguish. She is WEEPING now, and the house (everpresent in the b.g.) has become ENGULFED in the raging flames.
Dani begins MOANING and SCREAMING. Her howls almost harmonize
with the singing in the b.g. The fire ROARS and CRACKLES in
the distance. It’s apocalyptic.
Soon it’s uncertain whether Dani is crying or LAUGHING. Her
legs become weak and she collapses to her knees. Four Hårgans
(one of them being Pelle) run into the scene, carrying a
LARGE CHAIR - Dani’s throne.
The Hårgans lift Dani by the arms and SEAT her in the throne.
They then HOIST the chair into the air.
On the upward LIFT, we cut to a tight CLOSE-UP of Dani’s face.
She is being carried forward. Her expression, which begins as
one of great distress, slowly starts to TURN. Her agony
subsides into sudden CONFUSION. What’s happening? Where am I?
I’m on this chair, being carried! Her expression goes from
FEAR to EXCITEMENT to CONFUSION again. She suddenly lets out
an abrupt LAUGH (which we can’t hear over the music and the
now-deafening FIRE). Dani is now being taken over by an
*
invading sense of pride and contentment. This soon evolves
into a manic exhilaration. Dani BEAMS. She has been embraced
by a new family. She is Queen. She is not alone.

117.
A SMILE finally breaks onto Dani’s face. She has surrendered to
a joy known only by the insane. She has lost herself completely,
and she is finally free. It is horrible and it is beautiful.
CUT TO BLACK
