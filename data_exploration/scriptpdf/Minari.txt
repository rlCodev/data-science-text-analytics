“MINARI” by Lee Isaac Chung
FADE IN:
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY (TRAVELING)(YEAR 1983 - SPRING)
An Arkansas dirt road.
In the car is the Yi family, Korean American. DAVID (age 7-8)
is in the back. He watches his mother, MONICA (age 35) at the
wheel; she follows a 1980s U-HAUL up ahead.
MONICA
[Where is daddy taking us?]
David looks to his older sister, ANNE (age 10-11), for an
answer, but she’s busy reading a book.
EXT. THE FARM - MEADOW - DAY
The U-Haul and the station wagon turn into a vast meadow. On
the land is a SINGLE-WIDE TRAILER HOME. The vehicles park.
From the U-Haul emerges the dad, JACOB YI (age 37-40).
MONICA
[What is this place?]
JACOB
[What is this? This is home.]
David runs to the house and looks underneath. There, he sees:
DAVID
Wheels? Wheels? Whoa.
Mobile homes don’t come with stairs. There’s a three foot
climb to the front door. Jacob reaches up to open the door.
MONICA
[Really, what is this?]
Jacob laughs as he hoists Anne and David to climb:
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
It’s decked out in early-80’s brown and yellow.

2.
DAVID
WHOA. WHOA.
MONICA (O.S.)
[You said you’d find a house in a
big town.]
David and Anne explore the empty house.
EXT. THE FARM - MEADOW - DAY (LATER)
Cicadas sing. David walks, staring in wonder at the meadow.
Jacob and Anne follow. Monica lags behind, avoiding thorns.
MONICA
[And how far is the hatchery?]
JACOB
[The hatchery...? That way.]
MONICA
[I asked how far. Is there even a
grocery store here?]
JACOB
[Come here. Take a look at this.]
(taking dirt in his hand)
[Look. Look at the color. This is
why I picked this place.]
MONICA
[Because of the dirt color?]
JACOB
[This is the best dirt in America.
We made a deal, remember?]
(to David, in a Korean
accent)
Daddy’s gonna make a big garden.
MONICA
(Korean accent)
“Garden??” Garden is small.
JACOB
Oh no, Garden of Eden. It was big
like this...
Anne puts straw in David’s hair, and then he chases Anne to
do the same.
ANNE
David! No running!

MONICA
David! [Don’t run!]

3.
David slows and feels his heart while walking quickly.
JACOB
[We wanted a new start, right?
...Taste the air here.]
He inhales. Monica inhales. Then, Anne screams, running away
from David who is bent down.
MONICA
[What is it?]
Jacob is concerned also, is David ill?
David rises and holds up a GRASS SNAKE like a trophy.
[Snake.]

DAVID

MONICA
[DAVID YOU PUT THAT D-]
EXT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Jacob offers a hand to help Monica inside. She won’t take it.
MONICA
[This is not what we agreed.]
JACOB
[Don’t be like that; come look.]
Monica ignores Jacob’s hand and begins her three foot ascent.
She gets stuck on her stomach with her legs dangling.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Lift that leg... Now the other
leg... Good job!]
Monica fixes her clothes and glares at Jacob.
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Monica looks around. David follows and watches her.
MONICA
[Every place we move is worse and
worse.]

4.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Monica listens through a stethoscope and measures David’s
blood pressure.
Anne unpacks a CARDBOARD BOX and from the top, an old PICTURE
OF MONICA AND HER MOTHER (SOONJA) taken in Seoul.
ANNE
[Where should grandma’s picture
go?]
MONICA
[We’re not staying. Leave it in
there.]
Monica sees Jacob unpacking BOOKS.
Anne watches Monica jot the blood pressure reading in a
little notebook.
ANNE
Is the murmur getting louder?
MONICA
[Mmm. We will need to keep
checking. ...We need to find a home
near a hospital too.]
This is directed at Jacob, but he doesn’t seem to have heard.
JACOB
[Because it’s the first night here.
Let’s all sleep together on the
floor. Wouldn’t that be fun?]
Monica shakes her head in disbelief.
ANNE
[No, daddy you snore!]
DAVID
[I wanna listen too.]
David takes the stethoscope and listens to his heart: an
unnatural WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH
MONICA
[We’ll have to keep praying.]
WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH. David sees the photo of Monica and Soonja.

5.
EXT. HATCHERY - DAY
A team of OZARK WORKERS yell in country twang and guide a
POULTRY TRUCK into a CHICKEN HATCHERY loading dock.
David and Anne walk alongside the parents.
INT. HATCHERY SEXING ROOM - DAY
BABY CHICKENS in stacked bins huddle for warmth. David stares
at them.
MR. H
Hello everybody!
David looks to see HAYASHI (60s, Japanese), introducing
Monica and Jacob to seven ASIAN WORKERS. It looks like the
presentation of a newly married couple.
MR. H (CONT'D)
I introduce to you Mr. Jacob and
Mrs. Monica Yi.
Monica and Jacob bow politely. The workers clap.
MR. H (CONT'D)
Mr. Yi is an expert chicken sexer.
He comes from Seattle and
California. And let’s welcome him
to Arkansas!
No one claps. MR. H leads Jacob and Monica to their stations.
MRS. OH (age 40-50), gives a little bow.
[Hello.]

MRS. OH

MONICA
[Oh hello, there are Koreans here!]
MRS. OH
[Yes, a few of us.]
MONICA
[I heard it’s was only Vietnamese.]
MRS. OH
[Oh no. There are a few Koreans.
Fayetteville is bigger, but we all
live in Rogers for the schools. Is
that where you moved...?]

6.
MONICA
[Uh, no, we’re in a town called
“Holt.”]
MRS. OH
[...I never heard of it.]
MONICA
[It’s an hour away, in the
countryside.]
MRS. OH
[Why would a Korean move there?]
Monica doesn’t know. Meanwhile:
THE HATCHERY BREAK ROOM - DAY
Anne pulls out two big ENCYCLOPEDIA BOOKS.
ANNE
I’ll read “V.” You start with “L.”
David reads. He’s bored.
HATCHERY SEXING ROOM - DAY
Jacob works quickly, separating male and female chicks.
He looks like a poker dealer dealing fuzzy yellow cards.
Monica is slower, just learning. Mrs. Oh watches them both.
MRS. OH
[I’ve never seen anyone as fast as
Mr. Yi. Surely he made more money
in California.]
MONICA
[Yes, but I wasn’t fast enough to
work there, so...]
MRS. OH
[When did you begin working?]
MONICA
[Six months ago.]
MRS. OH
[In any case, fast enough for here;
you’re in just the right place!]

7.
Monica doesn’t seem to like that, but she nods respectfully.
David arrives next to Monica. Monica smiles at David.
MONICA
[Go to your sister.]
(to another worker)
I’m sorry, we have no babysitter.
DAVID
Mom, what can I do?
Monica flashes Jacob a look -- this is clearly his fault.
JACOB
Daddy can take a break. Come.
EXT. HATCHERY - DAY
Jacob smokes. He watches as David jogs and stops himself, his
hand on his heart.
JACOB
[David, it must be frustrating that
you do not get to run.]
A FLY BUZZES near David. He looks up and sees a big TOWER
covered in flies, emitting SMOKE and sounds of SLOSHING.
DAVID
[What’s that?]
JACOB
[That? Don’t worry about that.]
David now sees a scattering of other dead chicks. Flies
hover. David looks to Jacob - what is this?
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Male chicks are put in there.
They’re discarded.]
DAVID
[What is ‘discarded?’]
JACOB
[That word is difficult right?
Mm... Their meat is bad, they don’t
lay eggs. Males have no use.]
David stares at the tower.

8.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[So you and me should try to be
useful, right?]
Just then, a dead chick lands on the ground, having fallen
from the tower. The incinerating tower seems to grow louder.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[...Come, don’t go near.]
(when David is near)
Son. What do you think of the farm?
It’s good.

DAVID

JACOB
Better than California. [Right?]
(upon David’s hesitation)
...No? California is better?
DAVID
I don’t know.
JACOB
[When daddy was your age,
grandfather had a big farm also.
But I didn’t know it was good.]
DAVID
[Why didn’t you know?]
JACOB
[I just didn’t. After the war, we
lost it all; that’s when I realized
how good it was.] But, now it’s
o.k. The farm daddy bought is much
bigger than the one harabeoji lost.
...It’s a lot of land right?
DAVID
[It’s tons.]
JACOB
[Tons and tons right!]
(upon David’s nod)
...And how small was our land in
California?
DAVID
We had nothing.
Jacob laughs.

9.
JACOB
Now we have lots; isn’t that good?
(David nods)
Good. Good. You tell mommy you like
it o.k?. ...Let’s go inside.
David follows Jacob inside. They keep their eyes on the
tower.
INT. HATCHERY SEXING ROOM - DAY
David is on Jacob’s lap, and Anne stands next to them. Jacob
teaches them the art of chicken sexing:
JACOB
[First, empty its poop, or it can
poop here, on your finger.]
Jacob squeezes the bird like a mustard bottle, and its poop
squirts into the COFFEE CAN. David and Anne laugh.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Then look...]
(peering at its orifice)
[It’s male.]
ANNE
[How do you know?]
JACOB
[I just know by the look. ...Now
where’s a female...]
MONICA
[You should finish working.]
JACOB
[This is my last bin- a person so
slow shouldn’t criticize me.]
(holding up a chick)
[Now look. This one, female.]
DAVID
[It’s the same.]
JACOB
[They all look the same. But daddy
can sense something is different.
It’s intuition. I’m not using
this:]
(he points to his head)
[We don’t use our minds here. Only
intuition.]

10.
David watches the other workers sorting.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[You train for months to learn
this. Do you know that word,
“intuition?”]
They shake their heads “no.”
JACOB (CONT'D)
Good. Fine. When you grow up, use
your minds instead.
(points to his head)
[This is a job for stupid people.]
David looks grave, as though he’ll remember these words
forever. Jacob smiles and rubs his stubbly chin on the boy.
David giggles.
DAVID
Appa stop it!
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
After work. It’s WINDY. The sky is GREEN. The kids are in the
back. David holds the LUNCH PAIL on his lap. Monica drives.
JACOB
[The sky is green. It’s strange...]
MONICA
[There are four big towns, she
said. The Koreans live in Rogers.
If we move there, one of the Korean
grandmothers can watch the kids.]
(Jacob doesn’t answer)
[There’s a shopping mall there, a
decent school ...and people.]
JACOB
[But we made a deal. We come here
so you can work, and I can build a
garden.]
MONICA
[You can get five acres in Rogers.]
JACOB
[Five acres is good for a hobby.
Fifty acres... you see that was my
dream.]

11.
MONICA
[That place is your dream?]
JACOB
[We don’t even need a babysitter.
No one is around to bother them.]
MONICA
[And what about-- What if something
happens to him...?]
Jacob understands: he looks back at David.
ANNE
David, let me see them again.
David opens the lunch pail. Inside are TWO BABY CHICKS, saved
from destruction.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
Green skies mean tornados. The wind is furious. Jacob runs
around, securing loose objects under the trailer.
INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
Monica removes PLATES and CUPS from the cabinets, where
there’s a leak. The METAL ROOF shakes over her.
On the television is a “TORNADO WARNING” broadcast. Anne and
David care for the baby chicks, feeding them.
DAVID
Hey let’s give them Mountain Dew!
ANNE
No! Only water. O.k. David?
Jacob jumps up into the house, wet with rain.
JACOB
O.k.! [The car is ready. When it
comes, we hurry and go.]
[Go? Why?]

MONICA

JACOB
[In a tornado, this kind of house
can fly away.]
Monica and the kids look at each other.

12.
MONICA
[Stop looking. Go to the car.]
JACOB
[First we wait here and watch where
it goes.]
MONICA
[Watch what!]
JACOB
[They report where the tornado is
going on TV. Look.]
The TV has a “Tornado Warning” broadcast, and then: “BREAKING
NEWS” takes over the screen. Just then the POWER GOES OFF,
and the TV dies. DARKNESS. The house CREAKS.
[Mommy...]

ANNE

The LIGHTS FLICKER BACK ON. Anne and David hug Monica,
scared. The TV broadcast returns.
JACOB
[See look. It’s now a “tornado
watch,” no longer a “warning.” We
worried for no reason!]
Monica throws the WET RAG she had been using for cleaning.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Are you crazy right now?]
As Anne and David HURRY to their room to hide.
MONICA
[Who’s calling who crazy?!]
ANNE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
The SOUND OF PARENTS’ MUFFLED FIGHTING. Meanwhile, David and
Anne fold PAPER AIRPLANES.
Anne opens the door to throw her airplanes to the parents in:
THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
JACOB
[Who is this all for? You! The
kids!]

13.
MONICA
[Speak truthfully.]
JACOB
[I worked ten years! Staring at
chicken butts all day, coming home
to a tiny apartment without a
penny.]
MONICA
[And where did the money go? To the
kids? Because your dream is for the
kids?]
David throws his plane.
JACOB
[Don’t start.]
MONICA
[How much money went to the kids?]
JACOB
[I had duties as the eldest son, I
had to take care of family, and now
it’s over. Everyone at home is well
now.]
MONICA
[Who’s home, my mother’s home? Our
home? Who’s home are you talking
about?]
SLAM! Jacob hits the table with his palm.
JACOB
[I said stop!]
Anne pulls David back into:
ANNE’S ROOM - NIGHT
They shut the door. (Muffled sound of fighting continues).
Anne hands David a paper airplane.
ANNE
Write it big.
“Don’t fight!” David writes on the airplane.
Anne scrawls “don’t fight” on hers.
They open the door and throw planes again, into:

14.
THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A paper airplane flies past them:
JACOB
[Look at me. Have I ever done
anything for myself? I’m trying to
create a better life for us!]
MONICA
[Then why did you bring us to a
flying home?]
JACOB
[This is why I can’t talk to you.]
A paper airplane almost hits Jacob. Jacob looks down the
hall. The kids hide from view.
JACOB (CONT'D)
(to Monica)
[We wanted a new start.
...This is it.]
David listens from the hallway:
MONICA
[Honey, if this is it, maybe
there’s no chance for us.]
A GROANING WIND. Lights FLICKER. The window makes womping
suction sounds. The rain stops. Dust falls. What was that?
On the TV: BREAKING NEWS.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Anne! David! Go to the car.]
INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT
Jacob gets inside to drive. He reaches and pushes open the
passenger side door for Monica to get in.
Monica ignores this and climbs into the backseat with the
kids to avoid sitting next to him. Jacob has to reach far to
shut the door.
Jacob turns on the radio and searches for a news station.
ANNE
[Mom. Why will the house fly away?]

15.
MONICA
[It isn’t attached to the land.]
[But why?]

ANNE

MONICA
[Didn’t you see? The house is on
wheels.]
ANNE
[But mom. The car is on wheels!]
JACOB
[Anne. If the tornado comes, we’ll
drive to a safe place. Sit still.]
MONICA
[How about we pray Anne? Can you
pray for us?]
AM RADIO (V.O.)
Okay folks. ...Got a tornado touch
down in Evansville. Folks in
Evansville, a tornado touch down...
Jacob scrambles to look at an Arkansas map. Monica leans
forward to look.
MONICA
[Where’s our town on here?]
JACOB
[We aren’t on any map, hang on.]
MONICA
[Of course we aren’t on any map.]
WOOSHING WIND! DRUMMING RAIN!
ANNE
God please save our family. God
please save our family...
David’s eyes open to see Monica wiping away her tears.
But he can’t stay awake. The heater is too warm. The wind
rocks the car in a splendid way. David sleeps as the metal
womb holds the family from the CHAOS and CLAMOR until:

16.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - MORNING
It’s SILENT and still, sunlight streams through dust. David
wakes on his bed. Is this heaven?
No. He’s wet the bed.
LATER
David busily hides away his wet underwear. Then he shouts:
DAVID
Sis! Sis! Sis!
ANNE (O.S.)
What is it?!
DAVID
Was the tornado a dream?
No!

ANNE (O.S.)

LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MORNING
Anne and David emerge. The floor is littered with PAPER
AIRPLANES from the night before.
Anne gets CEREAL from the counter.
David pours two cups of MOUNTAIN DEW, smiling.
DAVID
(to himself)
My favorite... my favorite...
On TV, a 1980s style news interview of a STORM SURVIVOR
HUSBAND AND WIFE:
OZARK MAN
(on television)
It was real dark. That’s when I
heard it come rippin’ through. Real
big.
Monica emerges.
MONICA
[Already awake?]
The kids stare at Monica. She seems at peace. How odd. Jacob
follows, in search of coffee. Both behave as though nothing
happened the previous night.

17.
DAVID
[Mom, Anne said we have to move
now. Do we really have to move?
MONICA
[David, when you have a family,
will you choose a house like this?]
DAVID
[When I get married, I’m gonna live
here ‘til I die.]
Monica finds this funny.
ANNE
[But Mom, when are we moving?]
MONICA
[Mm... Daddy and I talked a long
time last night. We made a deal. We
will stay. And Grandma will come
and live with us.]
ANNE
[Mommy’s mom?]
MONICA
[Yes, and that means she’ll finally
meet David... Isn’t that good?]
David doesn’t say anything. He looks to Jacob. Jacob seems
pleased and puts on his HAT.
JACOB
[I’ll check the land.]
Monica looks around.
MONICA
[We’ll have to get this place
ready.]
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Preparations are underway:
-Anne removes the PICTURE of Monica and Soonja.
-A decorative, wooden Korean MASK is smiling on the wall.
Monica wipes it clean.
-On a bookcase, Anne sets the picture next to WOODEN
FIGURINES of a Korean husband and wife in traditional HANBOK.

18.
-Monica wipes a mirror clean.
-In a BOX, Anne finds a WEDDING PICTURE OF JACOB AND MONICA.
ANNE
[Why don’t you ever hang this up?]
[This?]

MONICA

Monica takes the picture and looks. It is such a good picture
that you’d be tempted to pray to it. Monica and Jacob look
like royalty, elegant, seated side-by-side, ageless.
ANNE
[In other houses they put up
wedding pictures...]
MONICA
[Is that so? Maybe later...]
The picture returns to the box.
EXT. THE FARM - MEADOW - DAY
DOWSING DAN (age 50) holds a DOWSING STICK with his eyes
blindfolded and demonstrates for Jacob and David.
As soon as Dan walks over a cup of water, his dowsing stick
quivers downward like it’s possessed. David is amazed.
DOWSING DAN
That’s two-fifty for one good clean
water well, three hunerd for two.
JACOB
Three “hundred?”
Dowsing Dan hands Jacob a pamphlet on THE MYSTERY OF DOWSING.
DOWSING DAN
Yessir. See, that’s how we start a
farm in this country. I dowsed all
the good wells up this road.
JACOB
No, we don’t need that.
DOWSING DAN
...I tell you what. Fella here
before you tried to save money too.
You heard what he did. Heh.

19.
Jacob holds the pamphlet out to Dowsing Dan to take back.
EXT. THE FARM - WELL SPOT - DAY
Jacob carries a shovel. He walks with David.
JACOB
[Stupid Americans, believing that
nonsense. Koreans use our minds.]
(he stops walking)
[Now. Look at the land. When it
rains, where will the water go?]
David doesn’t know.
JACOB (CONT'D)
High place or low place?
Low place.

DAVID

JACOB
[Where is a] low place [here]?
DAVID
[...There?]
David points to a small dip in the valley.
JACOB
[Yes. Where else?]
[There?]

DAVID

Another small dip, with vegetation.
JACOB
[Which place has water?]
[There?]

DAVID

(The one with vegetation.)
[Why?]

JACOB

DAVID
[Trees like water.]
Jacob picks up David and kisses him with pride.

20.
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Monica is strong and able. She pushes David’s bed to the side
of the room to make room for her mother’s bed.
Later, Monica lines a DRESSER drawer with calendar paper.
EXT. THE FARM - WELL SPOT - DAY
A FRESH DIRT PILE. Jacob has dug down to waist level.
JACOB
(while digging)
[Digging a well is just like life.
You pick one spot and dig. Don’t
dig here and there. Stick to one
spot. Then one day, you reach
water. Understand?]
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NEAR BARN - DAY
Monica sets TRASH on fire in a FIRE BARREL. Anne brings more
trash to the barrel.
MONICA
[We need to get you both new shoes.
There’s a clothing store in that
little town.]
Anne looks at her WORN SHOES.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[We’ll look our best for grandma.]
Monica puts more trash into the growing fire.
ANNE
[Mom, from now on, do we have to
burn all our trash?]
MONICA
[Yes. Isn’t the city better?
Careful of the smoke.]
BANG! A glass bottle explodes. The two duck for cover.
EXT. THE FARM - WELL SPOT - DAY
Water pools at Jacob’s feet inside the hole. He flicks the
groundwater on David. Jacob even tastes it.

21.
JACOB
[Did we use a stupid stick? How did
we find this?]
DAVID
[We used our minds!]
Jacob laughs and pats a muddy handprint on David.
EXT. TOWN STREETS - DAY
Holt is a tiny, one main street town.
There’s are a few small shops and a bank.
INT. CRESCENT’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
It’s a tiny, rural clothing store. Anne tries on new SHOES.
Monica watches. The kind SALES LADY (70s) assists Anne.
SALES LADY
Looky there! How pretty you are!
DAVID
(to Monica)
[I wanna go to daddy.]
MONICA
[Tell him we’re almost done.]
INT. HOLT BANK - DAY
David enters. It’s a small town bank.
A loan officer, RANDY BOOMER (50s) is seated with Jacob.
Jacob reads the terms of a BANK LOAN, and RANDY smiles.
RANDY
You’re a common sense man, Mr. Yi,
taking land folks are too scared to
buy. I respect a thinking man.
Thank you.

JACOB

RANDY
Now, lemme tell you, with farming
these days you have to go big or go
home-that’s just how it is.
(MORE)

22.
RANDY (CONT'D)
It’s a good time for it, Reagan’s
out to make farmers happy. And I’ll
be right here to help you.
Jacob signs.
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Monica chops at something in the kitchen with a BIG BUTCHER
KNIFE on a cutting board. What is it?
It’s a thick ROPE. She looks at the chopped end.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
PAUL (age 60) drives up with his beat up PICKUP, hauling a
JOHN DEERE TRACTOR. Jacob watches, frowning.
David, in his NEW COWBOY BOOTS approaches them.
PAUL
Hey there. My name’s Paul.
LATER
Jacob inspects the tractor. Paul stands nearby. He has a
gentle demeanor, a ratty Jesus t-shirt, coke bottle glasses.
PAUL (CONT'D)
If something’s wrong, you can call
the owner. I’m just the one haulin’
it.
David watches Jacob pull out a thick BILLFOLD full of money.
He hands around two thousand to Paul.
David watches Paul count it, a bit too slowly. Jacob puts his
hand on David’s head.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Now Mr. Yi, if you need, I drive
these things all day, drive ‘em in
my sleep. This a cattle farm?
JACOB
Fruit and vegetables.
PAUL
God bless you. I work crop farms
all over. Don’t be scared of these
tattoos, I’m a good worker.

23.
JACOB
Thank you. But these are Korean
vegetables. Korean fruits.
PAUL
Korean? Korean? Heh heh. You better
take a look at this...
David watches Paul uncover a 1950s Korean 10 WON BILL from
his HARLEY DAVIDSON BILLFOLD.
JACOB
This is old money! Korean War
money.
PAUL
Yessir I was there. A hard time.
I’m sure you know.
(to David)
Here, you wanna take it?
JACOB
Oh, he doesn’t need.
PAUL
I got more at home. You want it?
David pulls out a FAT, TEXAS BILLFOLD and tucks the bill
inside. Paul and Jacob both find this funny.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(to Jacob)
Soon as I saw you, I knew, we’re
gonna be friends. Can I pray?
Sorry?

JACOB

PAUL
(eyes closed)
Yes. Yes God. Thank you. Thank you
for the Yi family. Mm. Ha ha! Thank
you for this divine appointment.
(prays in tongues)
Amen. Yes. Big things, you got big
things for this family.
Jacob gives David a look, strange huh?
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Monica pushes the rope through a hole in a FLAT PIECE OF
WOOD. David returns.

24.
DAVID
[Mom, did you look outside?]
Monica looks out the window:
Monica sees Paul giving Jacob a big bear hug. Jacob is not a
willing hugger. She then sees the tractor.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Jacob puts some change away in the closet.
MONICA
[How much was it?]
Jacob changes into farming clothes.
JACOB
[It’s an investment. We borrow, we
pay back after harvest. In America,
that’s how farming is done. ...Why
are you smiling?]
MONICA
[So now it’s a farm, not a garden.]
JACOB
[Farm, garden, it’s all the same.
Think of it as money. In three
years, we won’t step foot in
another hatchery.]
MONICA
[Just leave enough for David,
that’s all I ask.
JACOB
[Of course. You seem happy. Because
mother is coming?]
[Why?]

MONICA

JACOB
[When you’re happy, you look quite
pretty.]
MONICA
[Yes, don’t I?]
In this levity, Jacob kisses her. But somehow this creates an
awkward moment.

25.
Jacob walks out.
LIVING ROOM - DAY
On the carpet, Anne and David look at a CHILDREN’S MAGAZINE:
A perfect Minnesota granny holds a TRAY OF COOKIES under the
heading of “Grandmothers.”
Anne smiles at David. A TRACTOR ENGINE ROARS outside. David
and Anne react to the sound.
EXT. THE FARM - LATE DAY
Jacob is proud, driving his tractor on his land.
Twenty meters behind the tractor, David, Anne, and Monica
walk, following the tractor’s path. In Monica’s hands: rope
and a swing wooden seat.
Jacob moves the throttle from “tortoise” to “rabbit,” and the
tractor zips ahead.
LATER
At a tree at the edge of the field, Monica tosses a ROCK with
a line attached to it, getting it over a tree branch. She
lowers the rock by letting up rope.
The kids watch: Monica tugs on the ROPE, and a hitch knot
tightens on the branch.
MONICA
[Who wants to try first?]
It’s a WOODEN TREE SWING, the object she was making. David
smiles, looking up at the branch.
SOON AFTER: David and Anne swing on it together, laughing.
Monica pushes them.
She looks in the distance:
LATER
Jacob plows fresh rows of dirt on the tractor.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - DUSK
Jacob washes dirt off himself from under an outdoor hose.
The night bugs HUM. A faint sound of a Korean HYMN.

26.
ANNE
[Dad, isn’t it better to grow
American foods?]
JACOB
[Thirty thousand Koreans are moving
to America every year. Do they miss
Korean food?]
[Yes.]

ANNE

JACOB
[So how do you think a Korean farm
will do?]
Anne smiles.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
A CASSETTE PLAYER plays a Korean church service, a HYMN.
Monica cleans David’s ears with a KOREAN EARWAX SPOON.
MONICA
[It’s because you’re shy?
(David doesn’t answer)
...Why don’t you like grandma?]
(David doesn’t answer)
[It’s not earwax, it’s dirt.]
She puts little a little dirt crumb on a tissue. David looks
at it.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Grandfather died during war.
That’s why mommy has no brothers or
sisters. You know?]
[Yes.]

DAVID

MONICA
[That means grandma has no one but
us. But you say you don’t like her.
Why not? ...Hmm? Don’t touch that;
answer me.]
DAVID
[You always fight about grandma.]

27.
MONICA
[Mommy fights about grandma, so you
don’t like her?]
He nods, and she’s amused by the reasoning.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Hey. Mommy fought because grandma
had health problems, and mommy
couldn’t be with her. And mommy
worries about leaving you alone. So
if grandma is here watching you,
will mommy fight?]
David picks at Monica’s THUMBNAIL, shit-stained yellow.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[It won’t come off. This is from
mommy’s work.
...Now let’s clip your nails. Look
how long they are!]
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Anne and David are dressed up. They smile for Monica and her
CARTRIDGE CAMERA.
MONICA
[My kids are so good looking!]
RIBS and vegetables are ready to cook on the kitchen counter.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[One more. Oh! They’re here!]
David hears FOOTSTEPS ON THE WOODEN STAIRS.
Jacob carries SUITCASES in. Grandma SOONJA (60) enters.
JACOB
[Grandma is here!]
David quickly hides behind Monica and peeks out.
ANNE
[Hello grandmother!]
SOONJA
[Hello! Is this Anne? Such a lady!]
Anne notices that SOONJA’S SOCK HAS A HOLE. Her lipstick is a
little messy.

28.
MONICA
(to David)
[David. Greet grandmother.]
David slips underneath Monica’s skirt to hide. He sees Soonja
faintly through the fabric:
SOONJA
(laughing)
[He’s hiding in mommy’s skirt!]
JACOB
[Come out. How embarrassing David!]
Monica’s voice shakes.
MONICA
[Mom, so you’re finally here...]
SOONJA
[You wanted to see me that badly?
Fine. Now I’m getting tears too.]
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
In the hallway, David spies through the doorway into:
DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
Soonja unloads one of her suitcases. Monica watches.
RED PEPPER FLAKES
MONICA
[Ahh this... You know, we can’t get
the right kind here; we even drove
8 hours to Dallas, and it was all
wrong.]
DRIED ANCHOVIES
MONICA (CONT'D)
[You brought this too!]
SOONJA
[Crying again? Crying over
anchovies?]
MONICA
[You see the kind of life we’re
living. I’m sorry mom.]

29.
SOONJA
[Why? A house on wheels! So fun!
...And take this, don’t say
anything, just take it.]
Soonja gives Monica a KOREAN ENVELOPE forcefully. Monica
immediately pushes it away, and they push it back and forth:
[No mom.]

MONICA

SOONJA
[Just take it.]
MONICA
[No, no, keep it, hide it. I’m
working now, mom. I should be the
one giving you money.]
Soonja finally shoves it into Monica’s hand.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[But where is this from?]
SOONJA
[It’s nothing. I sold the store.]
MONICA
[What about when you return?]
SOONJA
[You left Korea at a good time.
MONICA
[...then I’ll keep it safe for you
and use it carefully for the kids.]
Soonja notices David peeking in the doorway.
SOONJA
[Will this one ever greet grandma?]
MONICA
[David, come here.]
David creeps in. He crouches behind Monica.
SOONJA
[So this is the one who looks like
me.]
David whispers in Monica’s ear.

30.
MONICA
[What? Say it loud.]
(another whisper)
[She doesn’t look like a grandma?]
SOONJA
[Good boy. Because you say that,
you get something.]
She finds a pack of KOREAN PLAYING CARDS.
MONICA
[You’re giving Hwatu to a seven
year old child?]
SOONJA
[If he learns now, he’ll beat all
the other bastards!]
Monica and David just stare at her.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Fine. I’ll give you something
else. You want to eat this?]
MONICA
[Ooh tasty, a chestnut. Go on! He’s
never had one.]
SOONJA
[But... After the plane ride, it’s
a little too hard. Hang on.]
Soonja CHEWS UP THE CHESTNUT. After she does this:
[Eat it.]

SOONJA (CONT'D)

MONICA
[Mom, you don’t have to do it that
way.]
David just runs out of the room, grabbing the HWATU CARDS.
SOONJA
[Because it’s too hard.]
HALLWAY - DAY
David hides and listens. He can hear:

31.
SOONJA (O.S.)
[He doesn’t mind sharing a room
with grandma? I heard how American
kids are.]
MONICA (O.S.)
[He’s not like that. He’s Korean.]
David looks at a HWATU CARD. On it, a painted silhouette of a
distant hill. The illustrated HORIZON matches and fades to:
EXT. THE FARM’S HORIZON - DAY
A series of shots:
-Paul and Jacob walk toward the plowed field, carrying
shovels.
-Three rows have plastic covers over the raised beds. About
two thirds of the fourth row is completed with plastic cover.
Paul and Jacob finish this task by shoveling dirt onto sides
of the plastic to tuck it in.
-Jacob and Paul work two separate rows, punching holes and
planting cucumber sprouts. Jacob puts a foot and a half
between plantings. Paul puts three feet.
PAUL
You could think about doing
something out here. An exorcism.
Know what that is?
JACOB
Yes. No need.
PAUL
After what happened here. It’s no
good, something like that.
(to the land)
Out! In the name of Jesus, out!
Jacob finds this a little funny.
JACOB
Ok! Now things will grow!
PAUL
Hey you keep spacing them holes too
close. Oughtta be like this.
No...

JACOB

32.
PAUL
You’ll get all leaves no cucumbers.
Unless you grow it up?
JACOB
(indicating width)
No, here to here.
(upon Paul’s doubt)
You know I went to an agriculture
university in California.
PAUL
Oh ho. So you got a degree in
cucumbers!
JACOB
I only studied two years.
PAUL
Ohhh that’s how smart you were!
JACOB
No, no. I didn’t finish. I ran out
of money.
PAUL
Heh heh, good. I can tell you it’s
a bad school, they’re tellin’ you
cucumbers grow like that. Shoot
man.
We’ll grow ‘em the Arkansas way.
You’ll be happy too.
Jacob offers Paul a cigarette. Paul almost falls over.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get that away! In the name of
Jesus!
JACOB
You’re a crazy man.
That’s music to Paul’s ears.
Finally: Paul and Jacob turn the knobs on irrigation
connectors, and there’s a sound of buzzing/wheezing water.
PAUL
Good. Keep that soil wet.
EXT. THE WELL SPOT - DAY
The well hums where it was dug.

33.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
A CUP of THICK, DARK, HERBAL MEDICINE. Monica mixes it and
gives it to David. He struggles to drink it.
DAVID
[I hate it!]
MONICA
[Drink. Grandma brought it all the
way from Korea.]
David drinks and then stops.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Drink it all. It’s expensive
medicine.]
David manages to finish it.
[Grandma.]

DAVID

SOONJA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[Don’t ever bring anything like
this ever again.]
MONICA
[Stop David. You have to drink one
every day.]
Monica finds David’s shock funny. She’s in good spirits.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT
Soonja removes a small folded packet from a hidden packet in
her clothes from the airplane.
From them, she removes: MINARI SEEDS. She looks at them, a
small handful of seeds.
INT. ANNE’S ROOM - NIGHT
ANNE
Stop! Stop it! Go to your room!
David, pushes aside Anne’s toys to sleep on her floor. Anne
fights him.

34.

Go away!

ANNE (CONT'D)

Soonja and Monica arrive.
MONICA
[David, go to your room.]
DAVID
There’s a Korea smell!
Jacob arrives.
ANNE
You’ve never even been to Korea!
DAVID
Grandma smells like Korea.
Jacob sees Monica’s displeasure.
JACOB
You talk about a Grandma smell? [Go
get the stick.]
David stops and looks wilted.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[No? Then act properly in front of
grandma. ...Go on, sleep.]
David carries his pillow out. Monica seems to appreciate
Jacob’s intervention.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT
David lies awake plugging his nose. He looks at Soonja who is
snoring. The SNORING gets louder.
David sighs and moves his fingers from his nose to his ears.
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Anne stirs ATOMIC ORANGE CANNED PASTA in a pot.
David wraps a piece of WHITE CHEESE around a BANANA. He eats.
SOONJA
[Looks tasty! Can grandma try?]
Nope - David turns his back on her. Anne pours herself
MOUNTAIN DEW.

35.
DAVID
I want some.
ANNE
No, your drink is there:
The STEAMING CUP OF HERBAL MEDICINE waits for him. Poor
David. Soonja points to the Mountain Dew.
SOONJA
[What is that?]
ANNE
[It’s water from the mountains. Dad
said it’s good for your health.]
SOONJA
[Ohhh great! Give me...]
Soonja takes Anne’s cup. Anne sighs, annoyed.
DAVID
[Grandma. You can’t cook?]
[No...]

SOONJA

DAVID
[Can you make cookies?]
SOONJA
[No why? Can you?]
David stares at his grandma enjoying the fresh Mountain Dew.
DAVID
[Is there anything you can do?]
LIVING ROOM - LATER - DAY
A red and black WISTERIA CARD from the HWATU deck. SLAP! A
matching WISTERIA CARD lands on it. In Korean:
[EAT IT!]

SOONJA

Anne plays her card gently. ...David plays his card gently.
WHAMMO! Soonja again. Another pair.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[It’s a bbuk all you bastards!]

36.
Anne plays a card. David then plays and gets a match.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Bullshit, you think you’re
winning, look at this!]
Soonja SLAMS! Anne and David exchange a glance, what is this?
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Fast, fast. Keep the game moving.]
INT. HATCHERY - DAY
Jacob sorts the chickens at his usual fast speed.
Monica sorts slowly, carefully. She second guesses herself
and rechecks the last chicken she sorted.
Monica gets up to put the bin away.
The other workers work, their masks are bright in the lamps,
chicken dust drifting around them.
MONICA
(to Mrs. Oh)
[Why didn’t anyone start a Korean
church around here?]
MRS. OH
[With fifteen Koreans?]
MONICA
[It could be good. All the Korean
kids can play together.]
MRS. OH
[The Koreans around here, we left
the cities on purpose. ...To escape
Korean church.]
She’s half joking, and Monica plays along, politely smiling.
Jacob watches Monica, her smile fading.
EXT. THE MEADOW - DAY
David and Anne walk together. Soonja is ahead. Countless
grasshoppers catapult away. Anne whispers to David.
ANNE
Did you know she can’t read?

37.
DAVID
She isn’t like a grandma.
SOONJA
(heavy Korean accent)
Oh! You like grandma!
The kids laugh about this as they approach:
EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
ANNE
[We should go back.] David.
DAVID
Grandma’s going.
ANNE
David you have to be careful.
EXT. THE MINARI CREEK - DAY
Soonja is on the creek bed. Anne and David watch from the top
of the embankment.
SOONJA
[So wonderful.]
ANNE
(to Soonja)
[Grandma, we can’t be here because
of snakes.]
SOONJA
[Minari would grow very well here.]
(they don’t answer)
[You American bumpkins don’t even
know what minari is. Grandma
brought minari seeds from Korea,
and we can plant it there and
there.]
ANNE
[David shouldn’t come here.]
SOONJA
[The water is nice and cold.]
David climbs down towards Soonja.
A water moccasin disappears in the grass.

38.

[David!]

ANNE

David feels the water and sees the streaming weeds.
He smiles at Anne. Anne frowns at him.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
The station wagon pulls into the farm.
The car headlights turn off, just as Monica sees a big
delivery of LUMBER.
MONICA
[Is this for the storm shelter?]
JACOB
[First we need a barn.]
A tense silence. Jacob gets out.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
As Monica changes, Anne presents a PIECE OF PAPER.
ANNE
[There were so many bad things, I
wrote them down.]
(reading)
Grandma taught David how to curse.
Grandma watched TV for three hours.
Grandma ate all our candy...]
MONICA
[Mom’s tired; tell me some good
things that happened today.]
ANNE
[Grandma pinched us with her toes.]
[Anne...]

MONICA

ANNE
[Oh. And David’s acting worse too.]
DAVID (O.S.)
(hiding somewhere)
That’s a lie!

39.
ANNE
See! You’re spying!
Monica heads toward the kitchen.
MONICA
[Both of you, no fighting. Mommy
will make dinner, go and wait.]
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
KOREAN VHS tapes are in a box covered with postage stamps.
On television, a KOREAN MAN and WOMAN sing Lana et Rospo’s
1971 hit Korean song about lost love, “I love you darling.”
The family eats Korean food at the coffee table.
SOONJA
[We should grow minari in the creek
area. It’s just right for it.]
JACOB
[I’ll think about it.]
SOONJA
[Think about what? I’ll do it all.]
MONICA
[Mom, eat more of this.]
SOONJA
[That mountain water is tasty.]
David runs and grabs the MOUNTAIN DEW BOTTLE.
MONICA
[No...leave it there, drink your
water.]
The Korean man on television sings the first verse, truly I
love you. Darling, after you left...
SOONJA
(watching television)
[Hey, this is your favorite song.]
MONICA
[This song?]
Jacob eats silently, perhaps it’s true.

40.
SOONJA
[Anytime anyone asked you two to
sing, you would sing this looking
at each other all lovey-dovey. It’d
make our skin crawl.]
MONICA
[Is that so?]
SOONJA
[They come to America and forget
everything...]
The woman singer on television sings her verse--how many
tears I wept, you don’t realize...
David watches the MAN AND WOMAN DUO gaze at each other
lovingly. He then looks at his parents as they watch.
EXT. THE TOWN - NIGHT
Over images of Holt, Arkansas, not listed on any map, the
KOREAN SONG continues.
We see a water tower, fifteen stories high.
The square is empty, a gazebo is covered with mulberries.
Worn out tractors and mowers wait for service, steps away
from the library.
There are nearby pastures, warm lights from windows of
houses. Cows rest in the fields.
The love song from a distant land fades, taken over by tree
crickets in the Arkansas night.
MONICA (V.O.)
[David, it’s time to pray..]
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT
David is under the covers. Monica’s words continue:
MONICA
[Some kids prayed to see heaven in
their dreams, and at night, God let
them see it.
...One of the kids had a bad heart,
and when he woke up, he was healed.
What if you pray to see heaven
while you sleep?]

41.
DAVID
[You pray it. You go see heaven.]
MONICA
[It’s only for kids.
(she touches his heart)
How about it? Do you want to try?]
David looks afraid.
SOONJA
[Wah... you say all kinds of messed
up things to that kid.]
Monica laughs, having forgotten Soonja is nearby in her bed.
MONICA
(to David)
[You don’t have to pray it. But if
you ever do, tell me what you see.
I’m so curious.]
David doesn’t respond. Monica wraps up the stethoscope and
closes the notebook with blood pressure readings.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[O.k.] Good night. [Sleep well.]
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
There is a small box of BABY CHICKENS on the kitchen table.
Monica practices chicken sexing.
Jacob draws plans for a barn. The television is on, playing a
1983 KBS program on family reunifications.
JACOB
(to Monica)
[Practicing like that is no help.
Those are too old.]
Jacob watches Monica practice.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[...You’re fast enough for
Arkansas.]
MONICA
[If you’re not going to help me,
don’t talk me.]
Jacob gets up and sits next to Monica. She continues
practicing while ignoring him.

42.
JACOB
[It must be lonely here without any
friends.]
She doesn’t answer. She slows down.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Even if mom is here, it’s not the
same as having friends.]
MONICA
[Why are you saying this?]
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
Jacob puts on a necktie.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - MORNING
Monica, also dressed well, changes David’s bed with Soonja.
David and Anne are there also.
MONICA
[Next time don’t hide it from me
David.]
SOONJA
[Something must be broken down
there. What’s it called in
English?]
“Penis.”

ANNE

DAVID
[I dream that I’m peeing in the
bathroom, but I wake up and I’m in
the bed.]
MONICA
[From now on, before you pee, you
think,]
(pinching her cheeks)
‘Is this a dream? Is this a dream?’
[O.k.?]
David nods.
SOONJA
Pennis. Pennis. [Is your pennis
broken?]

43.
DAVID
It’s not “pennis.” It’s called a
“ding dong.”
David makes a face at her and walks out.
INT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY
The CONGREGATION is around thirty people, humble farmers
dressed in their Sunday best. The Yi family is among them.
It’s offering time, and the PIANIST plays.
CONGREGATION
'Perfect submission, perfect
delight/ Visions of rapture now
burst on my sight/ Angels
descending, bring from above/
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
A scrappy looking kid, JOHNNIE (7) stares at David. A bunch
of KIDS sit next to Randy Boomer, the bank loan officer.
Jacob almost passes the offering plate, but Monica tithes a
hundred dollars. Jacob’s look says, “that much?” Monica
ignores him.
Soonja notices the $100 bill in the offering plate.
LATER
BROTHER ROY (40s) is at the pulpit.
BROTHER ROY
If this is yer first time with us,
could you please stand? Oh don’t be
ashamed, y’all stand up.
The Yi family stands up. Jacob and Monica bow politely.
BROTHER ROY (CONT'D)
What a beautiful family. We’re so
glad you’re here!
The congregation gawks at them, wide-eyed and curious. Some
of them smile kindly, others are amused.
INT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH/FELLOWSHIP HALL - DAY
The parishioners talk to each other over refreshments.
Jacob is off to the side on his own. Isolated.

44.
David pours himself sweet tea. Johnnie shows up again.
JOHNNIE
What’s your name?
David.

DAVID

JOHNNIE
Hey David, why’s your face so flat?
DAVID
...It isn’t.
Now over to Monica, who makes an effort to meet BONNIE (50s)
and DEBBIE (40s):
MONICA
Hello, I’m Monica. Nice to meet
you.
DEBBIE
Well hi there! You are too cute.
BONNIE
How long y’all been in town, where
you been hidin?
MONICA
I’m sorry, my English is not so
good.
DEBBIE
Well that’s o.k.! We can teach you
English.
BONNIE
She’d be in a world of hurt
learnin’ English from us.
DEBBIE
We’ll teach her all our good words!
BONNIE
We only got four good words Debbie.
They laugh, but Monica doesn’t get the humor.
MONICA
Yes. Thank you.
A BIG MAN walks by.

45.
SOONJA
[There’s another one! So fat! So
fat! Quickly look!]
MONICA
[Mom, stop that.]
JUNE (12) and MINDY (12) follow Anne down the snack table.
June points at different things. June and Mindy giggle with
every Korean word:
JUNE
Hey, what’s that one called?
[Cookie.]

ANNE

JUNE
What about that one?
[Grapes.]
That one?
[Bread.]
That one.

ANNE
JUNE
ANNE
JUNE

ANNE
It’s just called a “pretzel.”
June and Mindy giggle.
JUNE
That is sooo neat!
Back to Monica and Soonja. Bonnie and Debbie gossip in low
voices and Monica looks lost, all alone. She sees other
church members happily talking.
David tugs on Monica’s dress.
DAVID
[Can I sleep at his house?]
MONICA
[You have to sleep at home, with
grandmother.]

46.
DAVID
[I don’t like grandma!]
MONICA
[Don’t say that.]
JOHNNIE
No? Why can’t you?
(to Soonja)
Why?
SOONJA
(about David)
Ding dong broken. Ding dong broken.
Johnnie laughs. Soonja is amused and makes David’s earlier
face back to him. David just blinks.
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY (TRAVELING)
The family returns from church.
JACOB
[With English, you have to use it
to learn.]
MONICA
[In any case, it’s better we just
work on Sundays.]
JACOB
[If you don’t want to go back, why
did you tithe so much?]
David steals a look at Soonja’s hands. Soonja notices. She
reveals that she’s holding the $100 bill. David thinks this
is bad.
ANNE
What’s up there?
On the road, they see Paul dragging his wooden cross.
Jacob slows down next to him.
JACOB
Paul! What are you doing?
Paul is happy. David looks: the cross is on a wheel.

47.
PAUL
It’s Sunday.
(meaning his cross)
This here’s my church.
Paul knows it’s a little funny.
JACOB
O.k. Do you need a ride?
PAUL
I’ll finish this. See you Monday.
Jacob continues on. Paul waves to the kids.
Jacob turns to Monica, as though to say, “funny huh?.” Monica
doesn’t respond.
JACOB
[Why? You like Jesus too.]
EXT. THE MOBILE HOME - NEAR BARN - DAY
A FIRE burns in the trash barrel.
Anne tends it. The SMOKE envelops her momentarily.
EXT. THE TRAILER - DAY
The PILE OF LUMBER is there, and Jacob holds PLANS for the
barn.
PAUL
We’re gonna build a barn. Alright!
JACOB
Have you built anything?
PAUL
Have I built anything? Of course I ...What is this?
JACOB
These are plans.
PAUL
We don’t need plans.
JACOB
Paul- we need plans.

48.
PAUL
Stop. Wait.
(listening)
Whippoorwill.
What?

JACOB

Paul whistles like the bird that’s singing in the background.
Jacob stares at him. Paul takes Jacob’s plans; whether he’s
been joking or not, it’s never clear.
PAUL
We build this now or later?
Later.

JACOB

CROP FIELDS - LATER:
The crops have grown considerably.
They hoe weeds between rows.
Then, Paul checks on irrigation lines.
PAUL
Jacob. This one too. No water. Bone
dry.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
David enters. He sees: Soonja is seated on the floor,
watching an over-the-top, ringside PRO WRESTLING INTERVIEW on
the TELEVISION. She’s wearing POLK A DOT boxers.
SOONJA
[Ayoo, look at those muscles.]
David stands over her. She looks up at him.
DAVID
[You are not like a grandma!]
SOONJA
[Oh? What is a grandma like?]
DAVID
[They make cookies! They say nice
things! They don’t wear men’s
underwear!]

49.
SOONJA
[Is that so?]
Her toes reach out to pinch him, and he dodges them.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Let’s drink that mountain water.]
He shakes his head “no.”
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Then call Anne, let’s play Hwatu.]
(a secret)
[...You and me, we help each other
win; we take all her money.]
DAVID
(pointing at her)
That’s bad.
David YELPS. He looks down to find that Soonja has PINCHED
HIM WITH HER TOES.
DAVID (CONT'D)
[Don’t do that!]
He pushes her away.
SOONJA
[David. Why don’t you like me?
Hmm?] So pretty boy.
DAVID
(angry)
I am not pretty.
SOONJA
No no. Pretty, so pretty!
DAVID
(he loses it)
I AM NOT PRETTY, I AM GOOD
LOOKING!!!!!
He storms away.
EXT. THE FARM - DAY
The WELL PUMP has been removed. Paul clears away pipes, and
Jacob rigs together a THIRTY FOOT AUGER.
PAUL
You make that? Pretty good!

50.

It’s easy.

JACOB

Jacob plunges it inside the well casing. He hits dirt and
then gives the top handle a hard twist.
PAUL
Might be a rock layer. If it’s a
water table well, you won’t find
nothing much deeper.
Jacob strains at the task. He stops to catch his breath.
PAUL (CONT'D)
How you figure it’s ground water?
Jacob points to his head to say I used this. Jacob goes back
at it; it’s difficult work.
INT. THE HATCHERY - DAY
Monica works in the hatchery, along with other workers.
Jacob’s station is empty.
Monica’s hands remain slow. She doubts her work.
EXT. THE FARM - DAY
Jacob removes the auger. There’s white clay, but no water.
PAUL
You could try calling one of these
guys.
Paul imitates dowsing, and Jacob isn’t impressed.
PAUL (CONT'D)
So what you thinkin?
JACOB
When will it rain?
Paul blinks at him. He looks like a wonderful owl in his
THICK GLASSES.
PAUL
...you asking me?

51.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
A CUP OF HERBAL MEDICINE steams on the nightstand. David
thinks. He throws Soonja’s pillow off Soonja’s bed.
SOONJA (O.S.)
[Anne, did you hide the mountain
water?]
ANNE (O.S.)
[We ran out!]
Something wicked seems to trigger in David’s brain.
BATHROOM - DAY
We see the TOILET. David peers at it.
He empties his CUP OF HERBAL MEDICINE into the sink.
David gets in position with the cup to pee in it.
DAVID
(pinching his cheeks)
Is this a dream? Is this a dream?
LIVING ROOM - LATER
Soonja watches on television: A wrestler gets clobbered with
a folding chair.
SOONJA
[Oh my, oh my, oh my!]
David approaches grandmother with THE CUP. He looks like
Prometheus presenting fire to humanity
SOONJA (CONT'D)
(watching television)
[Oh he’s killing him!]
DAVID
[Grandma, you want mountain water?]
Grandmother takes the cup, and she puts it aside.
SOONJA
(watching television)
[So well behaved. Sit and watch
with me. ...Oh he hit him again!]
David holds his breath and tiptoes away.

52.
BACK DOOR
David tiptoes down the hall.
David quietly puts on his worn boots. He waits:
SOONJA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
YAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
David bolts out the door!
EXT. FARM - DAY
His arms pumping, and his feet skeetering like he’s about to
sing.
Then he slows. He holds his heart, and his pulse THRUMS in
his ears. WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH.
He looks back, smiling. The palpitations continue: WOOSH
WOOSH. David catches his breath.
INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
David is on his knees with his hands raised in the air.
Soonja is there. Anne listens out of view in the hallway.
Jacob and Monica seem to be a united front.
David tries to keep his arms raised, but it’s difficult.
JACOB
(checking the time)
[O.k. David. Now turn to
grandmother. Apologize.]
DAVID
[I’m sorry.]
David gives a half-hearted bow.
JACOB
[Do it properly.]
DAVID
[She’s not like a real grandma.]
SOONJA
[It’s o.k. From now on, don’t do
such things. And I’ll try to be a
real grandma. Ok?]

53.
JACOB
[David, because you won’t bow
properly, go get the stick.]
David looks to Anne. “Uh oh.”
SOONJA
[No... Why would you hit that boy?]
JACOB
(to David)
[Go get the stick.]
David stands, gets a CHAIR and climbs up to get the STICK
that’s hanging on the wall.
SOONJA
[Doing this to a pretty kid... He’s
just a kid. So what? I drank pee.]
Who cares? It’s funny!
David slips and falls with the stick. It BREAKS!
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Oh oh oh.]
David is fine. He is, perhaps, even a little intrigued.
JACOB
[Bring it to me.]
David approaches with the broken stick. David seems to think
what’s done is done.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Go get a new stick.]
Oh.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
In the moonlight, David walks. Coyotes laugh in the distance.
David picks up a STICK identical to the original.
David feels the weight, and in defeat, he begins his return.
But then... Here’s ANOTHER STICK.
He compares the two. This one is a little thinner... He drops
the first stick.

54.
INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
Soonja, Jacob, and Monica wait for David.
Anne, hiding in the hallway, spies on Soonja:
JACOB
[Mother, we need to make sure he
learns.]
MONICA
[It’s true mom, you’ve suffered too
much in a place like this.]
SOONJA
[Shame and suffering! The way you
both talk. This place is pure
heaven to me. I’ll do better next
time.]
MONICA
[Mom, you’ve come all this way to a
hillbilly place, you don’t have to
say that.]
JACOB
[See, only you call it
‘hillbilly.’]
MONICA
[We live in a hillbilly place, and
now David acts like a hillbilly
boy.]
JACOB
[Spoken like a true Seoul girl.
Always looking down on country
people.]
SOONJA
[Fighting over this??]
Just then the door opens. David enters, hiding something
behind his back.
JACOB
[Let’s see.]
David reveals A THIN REED. It bends under it’s own weight.
Soonja claps for joy, jumps up and hugs him.
SOONJA
[Good job! Good job!]

55.
Anne joins in the dance and twirls the straw.
David sees that Monica and Jacob are amused by this
spectacle, and so, David is quite happy, and for once, David,
Anne, and Soonja are all as one.
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
Jacob can’t seem to remove his shirt.
JACOB
[Honey? Do this for me.]
Monica tries to help him, but he’s unable.
MONICA
[Why are you acting like that?]
JACOB
[I worked so hard out there, I
can’t raise my arms any higher.]
Monica finally removes it and walks away.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Hey... ...I need to wash my hair.]
LATER
Jacob is seated in the tub. Monica shampoos his hair.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Working outside sure makes life
good.
...Ouch! You dig your nails when
you don’t like what I say!]
This makes Monica laugh.
MONICA
[We’re losing so much money.
...I’m serious.]
JACOB
[It will be fine.]
She turns on the hand shower to rinse his hair. Jacob stops
her, taking her hand.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[I will fix everything. Understand?
All of this, this backwards place,
is something I’m doing for us.
(MORE)

56.
JACOB (CONT'D)
If this farm fails, take the kids
and leave me for good. I deserve
it.]
These words strike at Monica. She hides it.
MONICA
[Lean your head forward.]
She rinses his hair. Water streams from his eyes and nose.
Monica stands to get a towel. His hair drips.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[I’ve been wanting you to teach me
something.]
JACOB
[What is it?]
INT. MOBILE HOME/CAR PORT - NIGHT
An overhead lamp is on, moths all around. The coyotes and
bugs are loud around them. Jacob and Monica take a seat in
front of the table. BABY CHICKS are in a CRATE.
Monica practices, handing each to Jacob to double check:
[Male?]

Mm.

MONICA

JACOB
(with a nod)

MONICA
(to the next)
[Female?]
Mm.
[Male?]
Mm.

JACOB
MONICA
JACOB

MONICA
[This one...]
She looks twice at the chick.

57.
JACOB
[That is why you are slow.]
MONICA
[But- look.]
JACOB
[What is your first idea?]
[Male.]

MONICA

JACOB
(without looking)
[Then it’s male.]
MONICA
[It’s not up to me.]
JACOB
[Not an ounce of doubt. Doubt means
you’re thinking.]
MONICA
(meaning her chick)
[But really. Just look at it.]
JACOB
[It doesn’t matter. You said it’s
male. So believe it. When you work,
you need absolute, complete faith
in yourself. “There’s no one who
does this better than me...”]
MONICA
[That’s not my personality.]
JACOB
[Then you’ll never be fast.
I’m saying don’t use this.]
(meaning the mind)
If you want to train your
intuition, you can’t have doubt.]
MONICA
[Tell me if I’m right or wrong.]
Jacob looks at the chick. He withholds it playfully, until:
JACOB
[You’re right. Male.]
This makes Monica think.

58.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
As Monica enters. Jacob heads somewhere on the land.
JACOB
[Go in first.]
EXT. FARM - NIGHT
Near the mobile home, at the WATER MAIN, new flexible pipes
have been unraveled. Jacob, in the shadows, reaches his hand
into the WATER MAIN BOX.
Jacob TURNS something. SHWEEEEE water begins to flow through
the pipe, and the shadow of the pipe grows TAUT with water.
SCENE OF JACOB AND PAUL DECIDING WHAT TO HARVEST/MONICA
WORKING AT HATCHERY/MONICA CARRYING LUNCH PAIL ALONE INSIDE
EXT. HATCHERY - MORNING
Monica walks to work alone.
EXT. MINARI FIELD - MORNING
Soonja tends minari sprouts.
INT. THE BARN - MORNING (WEEKS LATER)
It’s recently built. Paul and Jacob work to sort a variety of
EMPTY CRATES.
PAUL
But these fit the garlic.
JACOB
Cabbages here, garlic there. When
you put insidePAUL
It’s all side by side.
You sure?

JACOB

PAUL
Well shoot. Space em for airflow.
Ohhh don’t be smiling at me.

59.
Jacob is in very good spirits, he knows he’s on top of it.
MONICA (O.S.)
[Jacob, phone!]
[Who?]

JACOB

MONICA (O.S.)
[From Dallas.]
Jacob runs out to the house.
Paul now takes the EMPTY CRATES:
EXT. THE FARM - CONTINUOUS
To the TRACTOR. As he loads, we see:
ROWS OF CABBAGES. ROWS OF PEPPERS. Insects BUZZ.
An IRRIGATION DRIP NOZZLE trickles water. (IRRIGATION PIPES SOUND OF WATER)
Soon after, Jacob comes back to Paul. He looks upset.
PAUL
What happened?
JACOB
Take it back.
INT. THE BARN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
Jacob and Paul move crates back in place. Jacob works with
some obvious anger.
PAUL
Where they getting their produce?
JACOB
California.
PAUL
They just change it like that on
you? ...we got some time Jacob to
find someone else. It ain’t rottin’
on the vines.
JACOB
Korean people, living in big
cities. You can’t trust them.

60.
PAUL
Forget Dallas then. Must be other
ones? OKC? Memphis?
Jacob throws his gloves to the side.
JACOB
I have to go to work.
EXT. HATCHERY - DAY
The TOWER OF DEATH grinds at full power.
The smoke is black. The flesh flies hover for food.
INT. HATCHERY - DAY
Monica is very fast at working. Mrs. Oh notices.
Mrs. Oh turns to see that Jacob is not as fast; his work
seems clumsy. He seems more tired than before.
MRS. OH
(seeing Monica get up)
[Already finished?]
Monica seems to take pride as she gets a new carton.
EXT. THE FARM - DAY
The irrigation pipe from before slows to a drip... drip...
The pipe system makes no sound.
INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
Anne tries the tap water. NOTHING.
INT. MOBILE HOME - LIVING ROOM
Anne walks into the living room. David and Soonja watch
wrestling.
ANNE
David, go change! It’s time to go!
David is wearing oversized polka dot boxers.

61.

Where?

DAVID

ANNE
Church picnic. Mr. Randy will be
here.
DAVID
There’s no water.
ANNE
Doesn’t matter go change.
[Grandma can you help him change?]
SOONJA
[Who cares what a little boy
wears?]
DAVID’S BEDROOM - DAY
David removes the DRESSER DRAWER slowly. It’s too far...
It FALLS! Match this to:
INT. HATCHERY - DAY
A crate of chickens FALLS to the floor.
Jacob has dropped it. Monica hurries to help him pick it up.
MONICA
(to Jacob)
[Your arms are that sore again?]
MRS. OH
Put the box there; if any are
injured, we have to throw them
away.
Jacob notices that Mr. H eyes him from the back. Monica
notices this too.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
David rises, straining. He lifts the drawer back in place.
Then he looks down: BLOOD pools around his foot.
He looks scared.

62.
DAVID
[SIS! GRANDMA!]
David clutches his BLOODY FOOT. Anne arrives but is shocked
and doesn’t move.
Soonja runs in and gets to work. She stops the blood with
some socks.
SOONJA
(to Anne)
[Anne! Get your mind in order! Go
get a towel quickly]
Anne hurries away.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
In the sunlight, Soonja has on her READING GLASSES and
dresses the wound with COTTON BALLS and GAUZE.
Anne watches out the window.
ANNE
[The church bus is here!]
SOONJA
[Go on. Leave David behind.]
ANNE
[I’ll stay.]
SOONJA
[You think I haven’t taken care of
injured people? Go.]
Anne doesn’t know what to do. As she leaves:
ANNE
Mom will be so mad.
David lies on his back and covers his face.
SOONJA
[There it’s done.]
David looks at the wound. It’s taped up.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[But why did you put the drawer
back? How did you pick it up, such
a heavy drawer?]

63.
He just looks at the bandage.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Stand up. Try walking.]
David stands up slowly.
Then, taking a reassuring glance from Soonja, he tries a
step. He’s able to walk.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
Strong boy! Strong, strong boy.
He’s never heard this.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[You’ve never heard that. But you
are. You know? You are stronger
than anyone thinks.]
He draws close to her.
[Grandma?]

DAVID

SOONJA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[What does pee taste like?]
SOONJA
[You rascal!]
EXT. THE FARM - DAY
DAVID
[Grandma, if you walk like this you
can go fast!]
Soonja laughs and tries it. She’s winded by it.
SOONJA
[Because you can’t run, you walk
like this? Do you want to try
running? Down to the tree there?
Us. Together.]
David looks to the distance. The wind causes the TALL GRASSES
to sway. David wants to run so badly.
Then he holds his heart.

64.

[I can’t.]

DAVID

SOONJA
[...It’s fine. Let’s keep going.]
EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
Soonja and David walk into the woods. They get to a path to
the creek.
EXT. THE MINARI CREEK - DAY
David plays on the rocks over the water.
Soonja weeds the sprightly minari sprouts in the stream.
SOONJA
[The minari is growing well! ...You
grew up in America so you never ate
minari. But it’s the best food. It
grows like weeds, so anyone can
have it. Rich person. Poor person.
Anyone can pick it and be healthy.
You put it in kimchi, put in soup.
When you are sick it is medicine.
Minari is truly] wonderful,
wonderful.
DAVID
(singing)
Minari, minari, minari...
SOONJA
[What is that? Minari song?]
David does a little dance as he sings:
DAVID
(singing)
[Minari, minari, wonderful minari.]
SOONJA
[Ah ha ha! Good! Sing again!]
David holds his heart, feeling something there.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Why? You O.k.?]
David nods. He notices the light on the water. A GUST OF WIND
blows across.

65.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[It’s a cold wind. Minari says]
“thank you very much!”
DAVID
(singing)
Minari, minari, thank you thank you
minari!
SOONJA
[Yeah! Yeah!]
DAVID
[Grandma! Look there!]
On a FALLEN LOG over the water, a WATER MOCCASIN SNAKE
sunbathes, having had its fill of summer cicadas.
David throws a rock and misses.
[David.]

SOONJA

He finds another rock and takes aim:
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[David! Stop it. Leave it.
Otherwise it will crawl away and
hide.]
The snake remains still.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[...with some things, it’s better
to see them than have them hide.]
David drops the rock.
INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE DAY
A loud angry BANG from outside. Jacob walks in. He had made
the noise.
He discovers Soonja is there.
He goes to the sink. By habit, he tries the tap. The water
doesn’t turn on. He sees the buckets of water.
SOONJA
[You’re working hard.]
Monica enters.

66.
JACOB
[I’ll check the pipes.]
Jacob walks out.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - LATE DAY
Jacob walks to the hose area while David plays with dirt and
a TOY CAR nearby. Jacob changes from his SANDALS to BOOTS.
DAVID
[Dad, I made a road.]
Jacob doesn’t notice David. David watches Jacob head toward
the fields.
INT. MOBILE HOME - KITCHEN - LATE DAY
Around the kitchen floor, next to a COLANDER of MINARI, there
are small plastic buckets and containers filled with water.
SOONJA
[All day, we gathered it from the
minari garden.]
MONICA
[It’s because of the water bill
this happened. He thinks I don’t
know. He used our water for the
crops.]
SOONJA
[How will it be fixed?]
MONICA
[The bank, borrow more, I’m sure.
Mom... I can take full care of us.]
SOONJA
[Don’t work too hard.]
MONICA
[But mom, how did you bring so much
water?]
EXT. MOBILE HOME - LATE DAY
In fact, David is spying in through the window, but Monica
and Soonja don’t know it.

67.
INT. MOBILE HOME - KITCHEN - LATE DAY
SOONJA
[That David. He’s stronger than you
think. He helped carry all this.]
MONICA
[He’s not supposed to do things
like that.]
SOONJA
[Even your idiot cousin Doo-won,
that big bodied guy, at that age,
he was much weaker.]
MONICA
[Mom, you really don’t know.]
SOONJA
[How can it be that bad? That’s how
kids are, they get hurt and bounce
back stronger.]
MONICA
[Even the doctors say he needs an
operation any moment. Understand?]
SOONJA
[...what would I know next to a
doctor?]
MONICA
[I’m sorry that you’re alone
watching him more and more. But
really, I only ask you to watch him
carefully. Please.
SOONJA
[O.k. O.k. I’ll do better.]
David steps down from the bucket.
EXT. THE FARM - NIGHT
Jacob then tidies a row of crops, using a spotlight to
illuminate the harvest.
He searches for signs of life. He finds an EGGPLANT. It’s
overripe. On the other side of it, it’s CRAWLING WITH BUGS.
He tosses it down.

68.
EXT. THE MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
We see the home, approaching to and fro, as though we move in
a strange serpentine way. The crickets and frogs cease.
A STRANGE SOUND emerges, low and awful.
DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT
A THUNDERSTORM brews outside. Lightning illuminates the
clothing dresser momentarily.
David is in bed, rubbing the spot over his heart.
SOONJA
[What are you doing?]
David hurriedly turns and pretends to sleep.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Why aren’t you sleeping? Hmm?
What’s the matter?]
DAVID
[Mom said if I pray I can see
heaven in my sleep.]
SOONJA
[...Ah, those kids who saw heaven?
(upon no answer)
...Are you scared?
(he remains silent)
...If you’re scared, don’t pray.
It’s nonsense, you don’t have to go
see heaven.]
DAVID
[But I prayed it! Grandma I prayed
it, and now I don’t wanna go!]
SOONJA
[It’s o.k. It’s o.k. then pray,] Oh
my God! Oh my God, [heaven] no
thank you!
DAVID
[But Grandma... then I would go to
hell!]
SOONJA
[Hey hey hey, why are you already
talking like that?]

69.
DAVID
[...I don’t wanna die.]
SOONJA
[Ayoo. ...Come over here if you’re
scared.]
David climbs into Soonja’s bed.
SOONJA (CONT'D)
[Grandma won’t let you die.]
DAVID
[Grandma...]
Soonja wipes his tears and covers him.
SOONJA
[Shh. Shh. Shh. Who dares to scare
my grandson this way? Don’t be
scared. Don’t you know how strong
you are? Here... Sing it again.]
(singing)
[Minari, Minari, Minari! Minari
Minari Minari!]
DAVID
[Minari. Minari. Minari.]
Wind rocks the little trailer home.
SOONJA
[Minari, Minari, Minari!]
This comes to a sudden HUSH:
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - MORNING
From the window: SUNLIGHT.
In the bedroom, David flings the blanket off. He thinks he’s
wet the bed, and he hurries to clean it up.
But his pants... They’re not wet.
Then he looks at Soonja. He feels around Soonja. It’s her.
She’s wet the bed.
LATER
David leads Anne into the room. They creep up to Soonja who
continues to snore.

70.
David points out what had happened.
DAVID
[Grandmother...]
ANNE
[Grandmother...]
Soonja wakes, a heavy drowsiness on her.
She trembles, her face is not right.
DAVID
[Grandmother why did you wet the
bed?]
Soonja reaches out toward David strangely. David avoids her.
SOONJA
[Leave me alone. Go!]
She seems transformed. It scares the kids.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
David is now alarmed.
DAVID
Why is she like that?
Anne looks at the clock.
ANNE
We’ll call mom from church. Get
dressed. The bus will be here.
O.k.
Wait.

DAVID
ANNE

INT. DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
Anne and David creep in together. David goes to the dresser.
ANNE
(quietly)
Stay back, I’ll do it.
Anne opens the DRAWER and gets David’s clothes. David sees
hwatu cards nearby. Anne closes the drawer, and they leave.

71.
Soonja opens her eyes and looks at the DRESSER. She seems to
feel menaced by something she sees there.
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Anne hurriedly washes her face in a BUCKET and then runs out.
INT. SANCTUARY - DAY
The church ORGAN plays as Brother Roy concludes his sermon.
BROTHER ROY
When Jesus comes again, and we’re
all gathered up, what a glorious
day that will be!
ANNE
(whispering to David)
I’m going to call mom.
Anne leaves.
BROTHER ROY
Sit still kids.
David looks at something in his hand.
BROTHER ROY (CONT'D)
But what’ll you say when he asks,
why is Rick from work, Sue from the
bank, why is Earl from the grocery
store not with us? Why didn’t you
share the good news of salvation to
these precious people? Boy I
wouldn’t wanna have that
conversation. Would you?
David looks at the HWATU card in his hand.
EXT./INT. CHURCH BUS - DAY (TRAVELING)
Randy drives the church bus while kids play and yell. Anne
and David sit next to each other.
ANNE
Mom and dad took grandma to the
hospital.
OLDER KID
There’s that cross guy!

72.
All the kids move to the side of the bus to look.
The bus approaches Paul and his big cross on the road.
They pass by slowly. The older kid flips off Paul from the
back window. Johnnie laughs looking at David. David smiles.
JOHNNIE
Think he saw?
OLDER KID
I heard he got a dirt floor and
shits in a bucket. He don’t got no
water where he lives.
The kids laugh.
OLDER KID (CONT'D)
(to the red head kid)
Why you laughing? You ain’t got no
walls in yours.
The kids laugh, and the moment plays again in David’s mind
like a regret:
-The bus passes Paul, and Paul looks up right at him. David’s
smile fades.
INT. MOBILE HOME/LIVING ROOM - DAY
Anne is on the phone while David hovers nearby.
ANNE
(on the phone)
[Yes... There’s still no water. We
can go get more from the minari
garden. ...O.k. I will. O.k.]
DAVID
Lemme talk to her. Tell her we’re
hungry.

Bye.

ANNE
(on the phone)

She hangs up.
ANNE (CONT'D)
Mom said we can stay with friends.
DAVID
Really? ...How’s grandma?

73.
ANNE
She wouldn’t say.
EXT. TOWN STREETS - DAY
A PICK UP TRUCK turns the corner and honks. An OLD COUPLE
sits on a porch staring:
The paved road passes underneath a front bicycle tire.
Johnnie rides his bicycle down the street, grinning at the
townspeople. David watches in the distance.
Johnnie gets to the end of the street and then flips David
off. He slaps at his butt and taunts David.
Then Johnnie comes back.
JOHNNIE
Now it’s your turn.
O.k.

DAVID

David rides down the street.
JOHNNIE
Fast as you can!
David smiles and rides. He stops. He waves at Johnnie.
JOHNNIE (CONT'D)
(in the distance)
No, flip me off! Flip me off!
David tries to raise his middle fingers; he contorts his face
to do so- he’s never done it before.
JOHNNIE (CONT'D)
Yeah cock suckuuuh!
That’s Johnnie.
INT. MOTHER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Johnnie digs in a dresser and pulls out a can of SKOAL.
JOHNNIE
My mom’s friend keeps this here. He
don’ mind.
Johnnie puts a little dip in his mouth.

74.
JOHNNIE (CONT'D)
Wanna try some?
DAVID
Does it hurt?
JOHNNIE
It hurts if you eat it. So don’t
eat it stupid.
(showing his lip)
Put it like this.
David does this. Johnnie puts on a big COWBOY HAT.
JOHNNIE (CONT'D)
I’m a cowboy!
LATER
They play HWATU with tobacco in their lips, taking turns
spitting into an empty COKE CAN. They have coins and dollars
beside them. Johnnie plays a match.
DAVID
You won’t get points that way. Get
the junk card, you’ll get a point.
No that one! Use your mind!
This one?

JOHNNIE

DAVID
Now it’s my turn.
(slams a card)
[IT’S A MATCH YOU BASTARDS!]
JOHNNIE
This a good game!
INT. JOHNNIE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT
David brushes his teeth by moving his head and keeping his
arm in place.
Johnnie does exactly the same. They start laughing together.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
FLOWERS in the hospital room. Soonja sleeps in the hospital
bed, monitored by machinery.
Monica is there with her.

75.
INT. JOHNNIE’S HOME - MORNING
Johnnie climbs onto BILLY’S (late 20s) lap, and Billy tickles
him and gives him a kiss on the head. Johnnie laughs. David
watches them.
David gets caught staring and returns to eating breakfast.
BILLY
How’s your daddy like that new
farm?
Good.

DAVID

BILLY
He growin’ things good? Doin’
things right?
Yes.

DAVID

BILLY
Gooood. I knew the fella who was
there before. You know about him?
Yes.

DAVID

BILLY
So you know what he did?
Billy points his finger to his head in mock suicide.
Who?

JOHNNIE

BILLY
Bucky Reed. Went flat broke. I
guess that’s what a man does.
...You sure your daddy likes that
farm? There ain’t no ghosts walkin’
round?
David just sits there and seems scared.
BILLY (CONT'D)
I used to have a farm. Shoot. Even
bigger than that up in Berryville.
Billy finishes and gets up. He pats Johnnie’s head.

76.
BILLY (CONT'D)
Tell yer mom I was here all night.
(to David)
You help your dad on that farm
alright? Don’t be lazy.
Yes sir.

DAVID

EXT./INT. JOHNNIE’S HOME/STATION WAGON - DAY
Johnnie watches David from the window as David climbs into
the station wagon. Jacob and Anne are already inside the car.
David sits next to Anne. Jacob looks tired.
JACOB
[Did you have fun?]
Yes.

DAVID

Anne hugs her pillow and looks tired. David yawns big.
begins to drive. David watches Johnnie’s house as they
depart.

Jacob

DAVID (CONT'D)
(to Anne)
What was your friend’s house like?
ANNE
Good. Kinda weird.
Yeah.

DAVID

David watches Johnnie’s house as they depart.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
From the doorway, Anne sees a lump of Soonja’s form. Soonja
stares with an empty expression at the DRESSER.
[Grandma?]

ANNE

No answer. Anne looks at the dresser where Soonja stares.
ANNE (CONT'D)
[What are you looking at?]

77.
SOONJA
(weak voice)
[Leave it there. Or it will hide.]
Anne looks again at the empty dresser. Monica arrives.
ANNE
[Why is grandma like that?]
MONICA
[It’s called a “stroke.” She needs
a lot of rest.]
ANNE
[How did it happen?]
MONICA
[It’s mommy’s fault. I was selfish
and brought her here.]
ANNE
[Mom. Grandma will be o.k.]
MONICA
[You’ve grown up so much. Already
seem like an adult. Mom is sorry to
make you do so much. I left you
both alone. It won’t happen again.]
EXT. THE FARM - SUNSET
Jacob stares out at the sunset, smoking a cigarette.
JACOB
Please. Please.
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
The sink. The faucet.
Just then a WHEEZE. A gurgle.
DIRTY BROWN WATER. The TOILET TANK SOUNDS like it’s
refilling.
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
David and Anne brush their teeth. David brushes in his funny
manner, shaking his head instead of moving his arm.

78.
ANNE
Mom wants to go back to California
because of grandma.
David stops brushing his teeth.
ANNE (CONT'D)
I heard them talking. They might
get a divorce...
When?

DAVID

ANNE
They said they’re gonna check your
heart and then decide. ...One of us
should stay with dad, one of us
should go with mom, don’t you
think?
David starts to brush his teeth slowly, the correct way,
moving his arm instead of his head.
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT
David climbs in bed, watching Soonja snoring.
He studies her face.
DAVID
[Grandma, it’s your fault.
Everything is your fault. You came
to America for nothing.]
The snoring stops. David hurriedly turns to sleep.
Soonja’s eyes open. She remains there, awake.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
A SNAKE SLITHERS down the narrow corridor.
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
A family dinner with Paul. He’s the first guest they’ve had
in the home. Paul is handed some Korean food.
PAUL
Thank you so much.

79.
Soonja, with her strange new expression, teeters and tries to
get water.
MONICA
[David help grandma.]
David watches but doesn’t help. Soonja spills the water.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[David! I said help!]
Monica cleans it and pours the water.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Mom, you already have water.]
SOONJA
(meaning David)
[Him.]
Monica puts the cup in front of David. David hesitates, then
drinks. Monica moves the kimchi.
PAUL
Oh no, don’t put that kimchi so far
away.
(face turns red)
...Sweating on my head.
He dabs his head with a napkin. The kids seem amused. Monica
smiles politely.
Monica hands out some Korean pancakes. Paul watches the way
Monica serves Jacob the food.
He then sneaks a glance at Soonja who feeds herself.
LATER: as the table is cleared:
PAUL (CONT'D)
Mashitgye mogosubnida.
MONICA
[Yes, thank you.] You are our first
guest here.
PAUL
I am honored. Thank you. Wish I had
something to offer in return.
(looking for something)
David. Won’t you come up here?
Paul’s hands are tattooed. The tattoos are self made, done
badly. He shows the tattoos on his neck too.

80.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Look at them. Look at them. Who’s
the fool? I put junk in my veins,
junk in my skin. Made these marks
in prison- a sewing needle and ink
from a ball point pen. That’s how
foolish I was. Now I carry that big
ol’ cross. You see it?
Yes.

DAVID

PAUL
I know what people think. You wanna
put marks like these on those hands
of yours?
No.

DAVID

PAUL
Good. Remember these hands David.
You’re good kids. You remember. You
and Anne both. Stay close to your
Abba Father. Be glad and generous
with what you have.
David just stares at the tattoos. Paul tussles David’s hair.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Oh how I like this one! ...now
where’d I put that box of oil?
INT. DAVID’S ROOM - DAY
David and Anne watch from the hallway:
Paul walks around the room dabbing oil from a wooden box on
the bedposts, the doorways, praying in tongues.
MONICA
She sees something on this dresser.
This one?

PAUL

He sees Soonja staring at it.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(fiercely to the dresser)
...Out. Out. You dirty thing. Go.
In the name of Jesus I cast you
out... (back to praying in tongues)

81.
Then Paul prays over Soonja momentarily. Monica prays next to
him. Jacob slips outside the room.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jacob is alone. The others walk out.
PAUL
It feels lighter! Do you feel it?
MONICA
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Please.
Wait right here. I have something.
Monica smiles and walks to the kitchen to pack leftovers.
Paul pats Jacob on the shoulder and offers:
PAUL
(between them)
Do you want me to pray for you
and...
(indicating Monica)
If you want.
Why?

JACOB

Paul knows Jacob doesn’t like this suggestion, but his
concern is apparent.
Jacob glances at Monica, who hasn’t heard Paul’s offer.
No need.

JACOB (CONT'D)

PAUL
I didn’t mean to...
JACOB
Come early tomorrow. Lots of work.
PAUL
...You’re my dear friend Jacob,
thank you for having me for this
meal.
Jacob nods, uneasy, not reciprocating.
MONICA
Paul, please take this.

82.
PAUL
What’s this?
(seeing the leftovers)
Oh ho thank you! You read my mind!
LATER
As Monica closes the door.
JACOB
[You used to say he has mental
problems, now you ask him to do
something like this?]
MONICA
[When did I say that? He came
because he wanted to help us. I’m
very thankful.]
JACOB
[What did you tell him about us?]
MONICA
[Why would I tell him anything?]
Monica walks away.
INT. THE BARN - DAY
It’s packed with PRODUCE. Paul picks out the best of each.
PAUL
This one’s good. And this. They
won’t say no when they see these.
They put together the BOX of SAMPLES including BROCHURES of
“BIG COUNTRY FARMS.”
INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
Monica prepares and packs away food in the refrigerator.
Soonja tries to help by wiping down the counters.
MONICA
[Mom, look, the food is all here.
You don’t even have to heat this
one, o.k.?]
Soonja accidentally causes a KITCHEN POT to drop.
Monica picks it up.

83.
MONICA (CONT'D)
[Don’t try to help so much. Just
rest, watch tv. ...we’ll be back
late.]
SOONJA
[I’ll be o.k.]
MONICA
[Mom. I’m grateful for this.]
Monica holds the envelope of money from Korea.
INT. STATION WAGON - MONTAGE (TRAVELING)
-The kids are asleep in the backseat.
-Monica and Jacob pass the time in silence in the front.
-They pass lakes and forests.
-The kids eat snacks that Monica hands back.
-They drive on the interstate.
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY (TRAVELING)
-OKLAHOMA CITY SKYLINE
ANNE
Wake up David. Look!
MONICA
[We lived in a city even bigger. Do
you remember?]
EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE ROOF - DAY (OKLAHOMA CITY)
Monica, David, and Anne are heading to the stairwell. Monica
notices that Jacob follows with his big BOX OF PRODUCE.
MONICA
[You’re bringing that inside?]
JACOB
[It’s too hot up here.]
MONICA
[Look at all the dirt on it.]

84.
JACOB
[Then go in first. I’ll wait for a
spot to open in the basement.]
MONICA
[We’re here for David.]
JACOB
[Go on in first. I’ll be right
there.]
Monica goes.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Anne watches:
A LAB TECH gives David a SONOGRAM.
Jacob enters now WITH THE FRUIT BOX; he wasn’t able to find a
spot. Monica seems annoyed with him.
Jacob gives David a small, encouraging smile.
The sonogram shows a colorful image of spraying blood between
the ventricle wall.
Jacob studies the screen, he watches the image of blood.
Is it bad?

ANNE

LAB TECH
Doctor will have to tell you.
(to David)
She a good big sister?
Yes.

DAVID

LAB TECH
He a good little brother?
Yes.

ANNE

LAB TECH
Heheh. ...Alright buddy, you can
sit up, get dressed, wait in the
waiting room. How’s that sound?
ANNE
Good. Thank you.

85.
He chuckles.
LAB TECH
A good big sister.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - DAY
On the path between the trees toward the barn, Soonja walks
with her cane.
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
Jacob picks at the chicken shit stain on his thumbnail.
David and Anne are far away looking at a medical poster.
Monica is next to Jacob, watching the kids.
JACOB
[Life was so difficult in Korea.
When we married, remember what we
said? That we’d go to America and
save each other. Remember?]
MONICA
[I remember.]
JACOB
[What could we have known? Instead
we came and fought so much that he
was born this way.]
David and Anne play a made up game together.
MONICA
[...Honey. Can’t you come with us?
We can’t do this without you.]
JACOB
[I’m not the one who wants to
leave.]
MONICA
[If I stay, we’ll go under. Only in
California can we make enough to
pay all the debts.]
JACOB
[We’d be chicken sexing til we
die.]
MONICA
[Think about it for the kids.]

86.
JACOB
[The kids need to see their father
succeed at something for once.]
The box of produce is next to Jacob’s feet.
MONICA
[At what cost? ...Isn’t it better
we stay together?]
JACOB
[Do what you want without me. Even
if I fail, I have to finish what I
started.]
Monica sees that Jacob won’t budge on this.
DOCTOR
Mr. and Mrs. Yi? Come on in-INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
The DOCTOR is with the family. He shows them a model heart.
DOCTOR
This is where the blood flows out
like a door - open close, open
close. See how close the hole is?
That’s why the California doctor
said to wait on surgery til he’s
older. But--you ready?--it looks
like the hole is getting smaller.
The doctor waits for a good response.
What?

MONICA

DOCTOR
It’s still there, but comparing the
measurements, it’s a significant
improvement. It means we can rule
out surgery, and we can see if the
hole is closing up on its own.
They stare at him.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
This is very good news.
MONICA
But the sound has gotten louder...

87.
DOCTOR
Yes. Sometimes, as the hole gets
smaller, the sound gets louder.
Loud is good. ...Are we happy?
MONICA
Yes. Thank you.
JACOB
Thank you very much.
DOCTOR
Must be the Ozark water.
Jacob laughs. Monica is clearly surprised. Anne hugs David.
ANNE
Good job David.
David smiles, as though he did something.
EXT. BARN - DAY
Soonja cleans up rotting PRODUCE that’s been discarded from
the harvest.
INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Jacob moves the box of produce. He lets ICE WATER drain from
ice bags.
MONICA
[Your father needs to make a stop.
Then we’ll eat. Are you hungry?]
ANNE
[I want naeng myun!]
MONICA
[Naeng myun? We’ll see which place
has the best naeng myun. Get in.]
The kids get in.
JACOB
[It’s been a while since we’ve
heard good news.]
MONICA
[It’s a miracle...]

88.
JACOB
[I told you it would be fine...]
Monica thinks on these words.
INT. KOREAN GROCER - AFTERNOON
Anne and David look at PIGS FEET for sale.
Look!

ANNE

David can see toward the back room:
Jacob talks with the OWNER (40s). They are laughing together.
Their conversation is inaudible.
The owner looks at the produce box, smells the produce.
INT. KOREAN GROCER - BACK ROOM
The owner flips through the BROCHURE OF THE FARM. There’s a
picture of DAVID AND ANNE ON THE TRACTOR.
OWNER
[Shrewd business idea, many Koreans
are moving to this area...]
Monica watches.
JACOB
[Yes, and most of your produce
comes from California, so it
arrives badly, with no taste. We‘re
five hours away.]
OWNER
[Very good.]
JACOB
[What day is good? My wife she
works, so I can come any time.]
EXT. KOREAN GROCER BACK ALLEYWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
The family bows to the owner to say goodbye, and they walk
toward the station wagon.
JACOB
(to Monica)
[Did you see?
(MORE)

89.
JACOB (CONT'D)
They have so many Korean foods now.
This is perfect timing. The owner
said that. Soon he will build a
bigger store.]
Monica seems guarded. Jacob notices this.
JACOB (CONT'D)
[Mom is in shock and can’t say
anything.]
The kids stare up at her.
MONICA
[Anne. Take the keys. Go take your
brother to the car and get in.]
Anne stops. She knows what this means.
[Go on.]

MONICA (CONT'D)

The kids go to the car with the keys.
JACOB
[What is this?]
MONICA
[You act like nothing happened...
Just now at the hospital, when you
had to choose between the farm and
the family, you chose the farm.]
JACOB
[It doesn’t matter, everything
worked out.]
MONICA
[So if our circumstances are good,
we’re able to live together, but
when they aren’t, we fall apart?]
JACOB
[What kind of talk is that? From
now on we make good money, we can
live in peace.]
MONICA
[So we can’t save each other, but
money can?]
(upon no response)
[The truth is, I grew used to the
idea of a divorce... David is
better, and that’s just as well.
(MORE)

90.
MONICA (CONT'D)
...One day this kind of thing will
happen again, and you’ll fail
completely, and it’s inevitable
what will happen to us.]
JACOB
[Then that’s it. Even after all
this, you don’t believe in me. I
feel the same way.]
After a heavy silence:
She appears to hold some hope that there are words that can
undo everything that has been said. For a moment, Jacob
searches for them.
In the distance, the back door of the grocery opens.
OWNER (O.S.)
You’re still here!
Jacob turns and bows politely.
JACOB
[We’re on our way. We’ll see you
soon.]
Jacob turns around. Monica has already walked halfway to the
car.
EXT. MOBILE HOME - SUNSET
Soonja tends to a fire in the fire barrel.
She tries to put a bag of trash into the fire but misses.
She tries to push it in, but it falls out. A small fire
starts on the grass.
INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT (TRAVELING)
Jacob, Monica, David, and Anne ride in silence.
Jacob and Monica stare ahead.
David then leans forward.
DAVID
(quietly)
[...Mom.]

91.
MONICA
[What is it?]
DAVID
[I prayed to see heaven.]
[You did?]

MONICA

DAVID
[I saw it.]
MONICA
(not listening)
[Good. Thank you for telling me.
Sit back in your seat, David.]
EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
The FIRE RAGES from the FIRE BARREL. Debris burns next to it.
Areas of grass burn around, and Soonja fights against them.
Floating embers drift in the air toward the barn.
Soonja’s face is blackened, and her eyes are wide.
A floating flame of debris lands on a spot of grass.
Soonja fights a small grass fire that burns further away.
STRAW BALES near the back of the barn begin to ignite.
The flames grow and catch the wood on fire.
The station wagon pulls in.
Jacob gets out.
JACOB
[Don’t come out!]
He runs to see where the fire has spread. He’s alarmed.
He sees that the back of the barn has caught fire.
He attempts to fight it, a useless effort.
Monica gets out of the car. She sees:
Soonja, FACE BLACKENED, walks out of the smoke of the grass
fire, as though returning from a holy mountain.
Monica hurries to help Soonja be near the car.

92.
Jacob runs around to the front entrance of the barn. He
enters. Monica sees this.
[Jacob!]

MONICA

INT. BARN - NIGHT
Inside Jacob sees the flames growing at the rear of the barn.
He pulls a canvas tarp covering the boxes and begins to beat
at the fire. (The fire is growing, but it seems like a
manageable size.)
Monica enters.
[Jacob!]

MONICA

Jacob turns back to her. Monica sees desperation in his eyes.
Monica joins in the effort to fight the fire.
EXT. BARN - NIGHT
Standing a five feet away from the car, Soonja watches the
barn, flames growing.
She looks over at the car, children inside.
INT. BARN - NIGHT
Smoke fills the air. The back wall on fire is larger, and
crates of produce are burning.
JACOB
[Go! Don’t be here! Stay with the
kids!]
It appears Jacob never plans to leave. He will fight to the
end.
[Jacob!]

MONICA

Just then, a PILLAR OF SMOKE (with flames/flaming timber)
engulfs the space between them, and Monica reaches out to
Jacob as she disappears into the cloud of smoke.
Then Monica is no longer visible.

93.
A sense of panic enters Jacob’s eyes. He drops everything and
searches for her.
JACOB
[Monica! Monica!]
He finally sees her, crawling on the ground.
Finding her, he reaches out, they clasp hands and escape.
OUTSIDE
Monica and Jacob run out, supporting each other.
Soonja, seeing this, seems to turn to the road.
Anne opens the door and shouts to her parents:
ANNE
[Mom! Dad!]
David remains in the car and sees:
Monica and Jacob are on the ground, catching their breaths.
David looks the other way to see:
The flames have begun to take the rafters of the barn.
Inside, the crates seem to be ablaze.
David turns again to his parents:
Monica and Jacob are collapsed together.
They cling to each other in tears, in a show of weakness and
need for each other that he’s never seen.
The light from the fire glows on them like embers.
The barn blazes, Jacob doesn’t even notice.
David looks to his side. The space next to him is empty.
In the distance, Anne walks toward the road with urgency.
[Grandma!]
David hurries out.

ANNE (CONT'D)

94.
EXT. THE DIRT ROAD - DUSK
Anne and David walk side by side.
Grandma!

ANNE

Grandma!

DAVID

In the distance, Soonja walks down the dirt road.
Light from a coming FIRE TRUCK illuminates her silhouette.
On her face is a look of something between self-banishment,
shame, and guilt. She carries herself down the road toward
the unknown.
The fire truck passes, dangerously close to her.
[GRANDMA!]

DAVID (CONT'D)

The dust climbs from the passing fire truck, and David and
Anne cannot see Soonja.
[GRANDMA!]

DAVID (CONT'D)

This is when David breaks out into a FULL RUN.
It’s the first he’s run, and he runs with all his strength to
where she was.
She comes back into view as the air clears. David stops when
he reaches her finally, catching his breath.
DAVID (CONT'D)
[Grandma. Grandma...]
Soonja stops.
Anne now catches up to them.
ANNE
[Grandma. This is not the way.]
David watches.
ANNE (CONT'D)
[Grandma, our house is that way.]
[Grandma.]

DAVID

Soonja tries to continue on her way.

95.
David becomes distraught, trying to stop her; this is the
most desperate we have seen him.
DAVID (CONT'D)
[Grandma! Grandma! Don’t go! Come
home with us! Grandma! Come home
with us!]
Soonja finally stops.
The kids take her by the hand, and they walk home together.
David helps her remain steady, walks with her with care.
EXT. THE BARN - BEFORE DAWN
The barn is burned.
On the ground: some scattered, charred crops in boxes.
INT. MOBILE HOME - BEFORE DAWN
Framed pictures of the family on display in succession:
-The picture of young Monica and Soonja
-A family picture from a past vacation
-The children and Jacob on a tractor
INT. MOBILE HOME - BEFORE DAWN
David, Anne, Monica, and Jacob are asleep on the floor,
collapsed from the fatigue of the night before.
Traces of soot remain stained on Jacob’s hands and nails.
Soot fingerprints mark Monica’s white nightgown.
Above them, Soonja is awake, in a chair, watching them sleep.
EXT. FARM - DAY
A DIVINER walks the land with a DOWSING STICK in search of
water. Jacob, Monica, and Paul follow behind. Jacob carries a
STONE.
There are rows of plants that have reached the end of season,
along with rotting crops that were discarded during harvest.

96.
The dowsing stick quivers down. Paul and the dowser step back
for Jacob, giving him space to put down the stone.
PAUL
O.k. mark it. That’s where it is!
Jacob doesn’t move.
MONICA
(to Jacob)
[Go on.]
Upon her words, Jacob marks the ground with the STONE.
It stands like a PILLAR, a monument.
EXT. TREE SWING - LATE DAY
Soonja watches David and Anne play at the tree swing.
Monica and Jacob walk together toward the tree.
Monica asks what they’ve been doing. She tells them it’s time
to go home, time for dinner.
JACOB
[Go on first, I’ll meet you.]
DAVID
[Daddy, where are you going?]
JACOB
[You want to come? Let’s go.]
EXT. THE WOODS - LATE DAY
Beyond the opening of the trees, we reach a steep descent.
Jacob slides down first.
JACOB (CONT’D)
[Hand me that.]
David gives him the bucket. Then, Jacob helps David down.
Jacob sees that ABUNDANT MINARI grows in STREAMING WATER.
LATER
Jacob clips and gathers minari into the bucket.
David gathers shoots also.

97.
We see closely, STALKS OF MINARI.
JACOB (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
[It grows even when we don’t do
anything... Grandmother picked a
good spot.]
David stores these words away, as something he might
understand with time.
LATER
From afar, we see Jacob and David finish their gathering.
They clean dirt off their pants, their movements are almost
identical.
They carry the bucket of minari up the steep path to return
home, leaving behind the minari and the flowing water.
FADE OUT:
