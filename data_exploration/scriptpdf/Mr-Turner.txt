'MR. TURNER'

An Original Screenplay
by
Mike Leigh

Sunset.

A windmill by a stream.

TWO WOMEN pass by, chattering cheerfully in Dutch.
A MAN stands on the horizon.

He is sketching.

This is J.M.W. TURNER.

TURNER goes on his

Arriving at his house, Turner lets himself in with his key.
In the hall, he hangs up his hat.
Oi!

TURNER

He encounters a young woman, HANNAH.
Aye, aye, me damsel.
HANNAH
Welcome home, Mr. Billy. We've been
worried to death about you.
For why?

TURNER

HANNAH
On account of that explosion.
TURNER
What was that?
At Ostend.

HANNAH

2.
TURNER
Oh, yes. I heard tell of that at
Antwerp. Dreadful. Dirty linen.
He gives her one of his bags.
HANNAH
Mr. William's been getting in a
stew about it.
TURNER
Is he out and about his business?
HANNAH
That he is.
Turner enters his dark studio. He starts to open the
shutters. Light streams into the room. Hannah brings him a
small glass of sherry, which he drinks. She helps him to
open the shutters and to move a work table.
TURNER
You faring well?
HANNAH
Thank you. How was your journey
home?
TURNER
It was execrable.
Oh. Mm.

Tea.
He has sat down.

HANNAH

TURNER

She hovers by him.

He feels her breast. Then he briefly lays his had on her
crutch. She scuttles out.

WILLIAM TURNER SNR comes round the corner of a busy street,
carrying a large shopping basket. He enters a shop. Shelves
of art supplies, notably large jars of brightly coloured
pigments. The COLOURMAN stands behind the counter.
TURNER SNR
Good morning, Signor Grande.

3.
COLOURMAN
Mr. Turner. Buongiorno.
Joshua.

TURNER SNR

JOSHUA
(an assistant)
Morning, Sir.
COLOURMAN
We have the damn rats.
TURNER SNR
No shortage of them in this city.
COLOURMAN
(says something in Italian. Then -)
What can I do for you today?
TURNER SNR
Let me see.
COLOURMAN
He is back?
TURNER SNR
We are expecting him any day now.
COLOURMAN
What do we need?
TURNER SNR
An ounce of chrome yellow.
COLOURMAN
Chrome yellow, Joshua.
JOSHUA
Chrome yellow, sir.
Joshua attends to this.
TURNER SNR
A large packet of flake white.
COLOURMAN
Flake white.
TURNER SNR
What is your price for a bladder of
ultramarine?

4.
COLOURMAN
My price is the best price.
He weighs out the powdered paint.
TURNER SNR
And what might that price be?
COLOURMAN
Blue ultramarine is coming from
far, far away. Afghanistan. What
else do you need?
TURNER SNR
Bottle of poppy oil, some Indian
red.
COLOURMAN
Poppy oil, Joshua.
Yes, sir.

JOSHUA

A bustling market. TURNER SNR passes by the stalls,
inspecting the wares as he goes.
He enters a butcher’s shop.
for him.

The butcher selects a pig’s head
...

Turner’s house. In the kitchen. Hannah pounds some
ingredients with a mortar. Turner Snr puts down his basket.
The pig’s head is visible.
TURNER SNR
There’s your prize porker.
HANNAH
Is he handsome?
TURNER SNR
He has a big smile on his face.
You making the sauce?
HANNAH
It’s all but done, save the brains.

5.
TURNER SNR
Good. Dearie me.
HANNAH
Will you take a dish of tea, Mr.
William?
TURNER SNR
Thank ye, Hannah.
He makes as if to sit, then doesn’t.
HANNAH
Shall you be putting those chattels
away? I should.
TURNER SNR
Best do it now. Then I can rest me
weary legs.
He leaves the kitchen, and goes up some stairs. Hannah
follows him at a short distance. She hovers in a doorway,
listening to the old man and his son.

...

In Turner’s studio.
TURNER SNR
You’re home, Billy boy!
TURNER
Hey, Daddy!
They hug each other.
TURNER SNR
I thought you was exploded. I’ve
been down on my knees and praying
you was safe.
TURNER
Well, you’ve been chafing your old
pedestals for naught, Daddy. I was
a hundred miles distant.
TURNER SNR
You heard tell of it, then?

6.
TURNER
I did indeed.
TURNER SNR
Terrible. They poor souls has
perished, two score or more.
TURNER
Yes, took a few brave soldiers with
it an’ all. I was vexed to learn
you’ve been entertaining concerns,
old Dadda.
TURNER SNR
‘Twas only natural.
Daddy.

TURNER

They kiss each other. Then they move to the work table,
where Turner is preparing some watercolours.
TURNER SNR
How was your crossing?
TURNER
Set fair on departure, lumpy in the
middle.
TURNER SNR
Did you sail from Rotterdam?
TURNER
No, Dieppe. Night coach from
Brighton proved to be an heinous
travail.
How so?

TURNER SNR

TURNER
It was stuffed full of yacking and
cackling females. Pox-ridden
harridan as broad in the beam as
the old Victory at Trafalgar.
TURNER SNR
Were your travels productive?
TURNER
Exceeding refreshing, old Daddy.
Amsterdam: had a gander at the
Rembrandt; Militia Company, Antwerp
Cathedral; Rubens, the triptych;

TURNER (CONT'D)
Flanders: still as flat as a
witch's tit.
Hannah brings Turner Snr a cup of tea.
TURNER SNR
Thank you, Hannah. You sly girl.
Did you find tolerable diggings?
TURNER
Stinking fleapit at Dieppe, then
moved to the harbour. Westerly
aspect, fine sunset. Oh, Daddy,
I’m in need of an eight by six.
TURNER SNR
I have a seven by five and a half
ready sized and primed.
TURNER
That should suit.
TURNER SNR
Right you be.
Turner Snr sits down at a desk.
TURNER
More's to the point, how have you
been faring?
TURNER SNR
In good health, thank the Lord.
TURNER
Bronchials still rattling?
No.

TURNER SNR

HANNAH
He was wheezing last week.
Shh!

TURNER SNR

TURNER
October ain’t quite come round the
corner yet, has it?
TURNER SNR
I’ve been over to Grande’s.
Ultramarine's gone up to a guinea a
bladder.

8.
TURNER
Gawd’s truth! That brigand still
robbing us, is he?
TURNER SNR
You’re in need of a shave.
TURNER
Well, be that as it may, Daddy.
Presently I'm gonna throw myself
into the arms of Morpheus.
Turner leaves the room and goes upstairs. Hannah hovers for
a moment, then leaves. The old man attends to some
paperwork.
...

Turner’s house. Turner Snr bears a very large canvas through
the hall, and into the studio.

...

In the kitchen, Hannah watches as Turner Snr shaves the pig’s
head.
...

Turner Snr carries a jug of hot water up the stairs and
enters Turner’s bedroom.
Turner is asleep on his bed, fully clothed. His father
pinches his toe. He wakes up. Church bells chime in the
distance.
...

A little later, Turner Snr is shaving his son.
TURNER SNR
I took a trip down west, Exeter,
last week.

9.
TURNER
How fares the old uncle?
TURNER SNR
Bearing up, considering.
TURNER
Considering what?
TURNER SNR
Well, his age, living alone.
Here’s the thing. He wants to
arrange a family gathering.
They both roar with laughter.
...

Father and son are eating at the kitchen table. Hannah sits
nearby, watching them. The cooked pig’s head sits on a large
plate.
TURNER SNR
Will you take some more cheek?
TURNER
Cast us another morsel.
Turner Snr serves his a slice of pork.
vegetables.

Hannah gives him some

HANNAH
Missing your button, Mr. Billy.
Turner inspects his coat. Hannah scratches the back of her
neck, which is a little inflamed.
...

A darkened room in Turner’s house, hardly lit - only a couple
of candles. Turner Snr shows three middle-aged people into
the room, and ELEGANT LADY and GENTLEMAN, and a long-haired,
bespectacled ARTISTIC-LOOKING MAN.
TURNER SNR
Be so kind as to enter the
vestibule. The darkness is to a
purpose. I shall return, by and
by.

10.
He goes out, closing the door behind him. The gentleman
whispers something to the lady. Long pause. Then Turner Snr
returns. He moves round them.
Madam.

TURNER SNR
Gentlemen.

He stops by some double doors, which are closed.
Behold!

TURNER SNR

Turner’s brightly-lit art gallery is revealed.
TURNER SNR
Three steps down. Pray view at
your leisure.
The trio step down into the gallery and begin to peruse the
paintings. Turner Snr hovers near the door.
...

Turner is in his studio, painting at an easel. He stops, and
goes to the wall; he opens a very small door, about the size
of a small book, and looks through a tiny peep-hole into the
gallery. Turner Snr smiles slyly at him as the potential
customers inspect the goods.

...

A little later, Turner is still painting in his studio.
His father is relaxing in the drawing room, reading his
newspaper and smoking his pipe. There is a loud knock on the
front door. He looks up.
On her way to the front door, Hannah closes the door of
Turner’s studio.

...
In the drawing room Turner Snr listens to the following,
which we only hear. So does Turner in his studio. He is not
pleased.

11.
SARAH DANBY
Good day to you, Hannah.
HANNAH
Good day to you, Aunt Sarah.
SARAH DANBY
And how are you faring?
HANNAH
Very well, thank you. Are you
coming in?
SARAH DANBY
I most certainly am. Is he at
home?
He is.

HANNAH
I’ll tell him you’re here.

SARAH DANBY
I can inform him myself, thank you
kindly.
SARAH DANBY now bursts aggressively into Turner’s studio,
accompanied by her two adult DAUGHTERS, one of whom holds a
newborn baby.
SARAH DANBY
Good day to you, sir.
TURNER
And a very good day to you, Mrs D.
He continues to paint.
SARAH DANBY
And how do we find you on this fair
morning?
TURNER
Exceedingly preoccupied, madam.
SARAH DANBY
‘Twas ever thus. You’ve always
been preoccupied. You’re too
preoccupied for your own good, sir.
TURNER
Nothing comes from nothing, madam.

12.
SARAH DANBY
And we have had nothing from you,
sir. Evelina, Georgiana, come and
greet your father.
EVELINA
Good day, Father. May I present my
child to you?
SARAH DANBY
Your granddaughter.
EVELINA
Rosalie Adelaide.
SARAH DANBY
Your only surviving grandchild.
Georgiana, cease your dithering!
The younger daughter, who has hovered by the door, comes
forward tentatively.
TURNER
May I suggest, Mrs. D, with the
utmost respect, that you withdraw
to the drawing room?
Turner Snr enters.
TURNER SNR
Good day to you, Mrs Danby.
you care to step this way?

Would

SARAH DANBY
Good day to you, Mister Turner.
(To Turner)
And will you be gracing us with
your presence in the withdrawing
room, sir?
Hmm.

TURNER

SARAH DANBY
I sincerely hope you will. And,
pray, do not keep us waiting. We
have our own lives to lead. Come
along, daughters.
EVELINA
The vapours in this room are most
noxious to a child’s lungs.

13.
The women all sweep out. Turner Snr exchanges an
understanding glance with his son, then leaves, closing the
door behind him. As he does so, Turner angrily kicks a stool
across the studio.
...

In the drawing room. Evelina has sat down, holding the baby.
Sarah and Georgiana stand by the sofa. Hannah hovers.
Turner Snr enters.
TURNER SNR
Ladies, pray, sit yourselves.
Sarah, if you please.
SARAH DANBY
I shall be seated, William, when it
suits me, and not before.
So be it.

Thank you, Grandfather.
most proud of her.

We are

SARAH DANBY
We are indeed.
HANNAH
Have you been out strolling, Aunt
Sarah?
SARAH DANBY
No, neice. I’ve been to collect my
pension at Leicester Fields, it
being the first of the month.
She sits.
Indeed.

HANNAH

Enter Turner.
TURNER
Your latest infant?
EVELINA
To be sure, Father.

14.
TURNER
Of robust constitution?
EVELINA
She has an excellent character.
TURNER
One must trust in Providence.
Colour of eye?
EVELINA
Blue, as yourself.
Splendid.

TURNER

SARAH DANBY
Do not forget your other daughter,
sir, whom you have deigned to
neglect these past two years. Sit
down, Georgiana.
Georgiana does so.
EVELINA
She is learning French.
SARAH DANBY
And music. She is having an
education. Reading, writing,
arithmetic and geography with the
globe.
EVELINA
Sit up straight, Georgie. Dit
quelque chose en français.
Bonjour.

TURNER

GEORGIANA
Bonjour, Papa.
SARAH DANBY
Are you keeping well?
I am.

SARAH DANBY
I was not addressing you, sir.

I enjoy good health, thank’ee.
yourself.

And

SARAH DANBY
We are surviving as best we can
under the circumstances.
TURNER SNR
And what circumstances might they
be?
SARAH DANBY
Straightened circumstances, sir.
But we manage to keep body and soul
together, no thanks to your
ungrateful son.
Turner walks out of the room.
after him.

Sarah gets up, and shouts

SARAH DANBY
How dare you take your leave of me,
Billy Turner! You insult me, as
you have always insulted me!
Billy!
...

A street. Turner gets into a two-horse coach. A coachman
holds the door open for him, then closes it, and clambers up
onto the back of the coach. There are two coachmen at the
front. One of them is driving. The coach leaves.

...

Now the coach wends its way through the beautiful English
countryside.
It arrives at a stately home.

...

16.
Later. Sunset. Across an expansive meadow towards the house
comes an elderly gentleman with his dogs. This is LORD
EGREMONT, and the house is Petworth. Turner watches him from
the steps. Lord Egremont arrives, the dogs disperse, and the
two men walk through a couple of rooms. A piano is being
played somewhere nearby.
LORD EGREMONT
Good evening, William.
TURNER
Felicitations of the evening to
you, Your Lordship. You faring
well?
LORD EGREMONT
Bit breathless. Been up to the
farm. Watch the sunset. Say
goodnight to the milkmaids.
TURNER
Any further consideration as to
mechanicalising the thresher?
LORD EGREMONT
You can’t beat the old oxen.
TURNER
Is that so, Your Lordship?
LORD EGREMONT
Indeed. We had a ploughing
competition last spring between
teams of horses and teams of oxen.
TURNER
And the victor?
LORD EGREMONT
The horses.
TURNER
Well, the ox is a sluggish beast.
LORD EGREMONT
Yes, but strong.
TURNER
With the added benefit, when it
comes to the end of its natural
working life, it makes a very
succulent dish.

17.
LORD EGREMONT
Unlike the horse.
TURNER
Good for glue.
A STOUT, AFFECTED FELLOW has been hovering in the background.
He now approaches them.
MANNERS
Your Lordship. A very good evening
to you, sir.
LORD EGREMONT
Good evening, Manners.
MANNERS
Mr. Turner. Are we not blessed by
the heavens to witness so glorious
a crepuscular time of day......?
He leaves them.
Imbecile.

LORD EGREMONT

Turner and Lord Egremont now inspect a pair of Turner’s
landscapes that have clearly been painted specially for the
permanent positions they occupy in the room.
TURNER
Continuing satisfaction as to the
arrangement, Your Lordship?
LORD EGREMONT
I think we have successfully
achieved the correct effect,
William.
Thank you.

TURNER

They move on, passing a wigged footman who is seeing to the
candelabra on the mantelpiece.
LORD EGREMONT
Good evening, Nat.
FOOTMAN
Good evening, My Lord.
They now pass A LADY playing the piano.

18.
LORD EGREMONT
Good evening, Miss Coggins.
MISS COGGINS
Your Lordship. Mr. Turner.
Turner and Lord Egremont arrive at two more of Turner’s
paintings set in the wall.
LORD EGREMONT
How’s your Father faring, William?
TURNER
Bearing up, Your Lordship. Very
gracious of you to inquire. We
thought we’d lost him this last
winter, a very harsh one. He came
through. He’s a hardy old cove.
Excellent.
Indeed.

LORD EGREMONT
See you at dinner.
TURNER

After a momentary pause, Turner joins Miss Coggins, standing
near the piano until she finishes playing.
TURNER
Exceedingly beautiful.
MISS COGGINS
You are too kind.
TURNER
I’m familiar with the melody,
but...
MISS COGGINS
Herr Beethoven. The Pathétique.
TURNER
I possess a rare fondness for Henry
Purcell.
As do I.

MISS COGGINS
Yes.

She plays a fragment of a tune.
TURNER
‘Dido’s Lament.’

Miss Coggins is overcome with

Elsewhere in the house, two slightly hysterical YOUNG LADIES
rush up a staircase, stopping at the top by a doorway. They
giggle at something going on in the room, which they then
enter. Watched by a stout, MIDDLE-AGED LADY sitting near
him, Turner is painting at an easel. The young women join
them.

20.
LADY STUCKLEY
Mr. Turner: I have often pondered:
might there be a distinction
between the way you paint a sunrise
as opposed to a sunset?
TURNER
There is indeed, Lady Stuckley.
‘Cause one is going up, whilst the
other is going ...
FIRST YOUNG LADY
... the other is going down.
SECOND YOUNG LADY
Eliza, do hush.
LADY STUCKLEY
And might it also be determined by
the angle of the light?
TURNER
Well, it’s weather, vapour, wind,
frangibility and such like.
SECOND YOUNG LADY
Eliza, look at his nails.
Shh.

FIRST YOUNG LADY

TURNER
Whilst you Goddesses are
languishing in the Kingdom of
Hypnos, I am up before the lark to
witness Helios popping his head
above the parapet, with the only
benefit that the sunrise is not
afflicted... with diminishing
light.
He spits on the canvas. One of the young ladies laughs,
whilst the other turns away in disgust.
...

Still at Petworth. Turner leads a bespectacled man into a
room, where a third man is looking at a painting. The men
are HAYDON, a painter, and CAREW, a sculptor. Carew speaks
with an Irish accent. The painting is “Saint Sebastian
comforted by an Angel” by Gerard Seghers. Turner slaps Carew
on the back.

21.

Carew.

TURNER

CAREW
Turner. I’m by way of observing
poor Saint Sebastian here.
HAYDON
The artist is not known to me.
TURNER
Flemish. Uncommonly capacious rump
on the cherub.
HAYDON
It might have gained in potency
with an increase of arrows.
TURNER
Well, yon celestial fellow’s
tugging them all out.
HAYDON
I can hardly bear to look upon it.
CAREW
The pain on his face.
resignation in it.

The mark of

HAYDON
‘Tis a willing sacrifice, is it
not?
TURNER
‘Twas not how the poor soul
perished. He was brought back to
full health by a good Samaritan.
Then the heathens cudgelled him to
death and deposited him in a sewer.
HAYDON
I would question the veracity of
that telling.
TURNER
No good deed goes unpunished.
At this, Carew promptly leaves.
HAYDON
What a curious fate is mine. Last
month in the King’s Bench Prison in
the company of debtors.
(MORE)

22.
HAYDON (CONT'D)
This month a guest of quality, rank
and fashion.
TURNER
Rejoice, Haydon. You find yourself
in a veritable bacchanalia. His
Lordship keeps a very fine wine
cellar. Be sanguine. Fill your
boots!
HAYDON
Might I ask you to loan me some
money, Turner?
TURNER
I beg your pardon?
HAYDON
I’m in dire and pressing need of
one hundred pounds.
TURNER
Out of the question.
HAYDON
My landlord, he’s a good man, a
patient man, but he will not wait
forever. I need to pay the wine
merchant, my colourman ...
TURNER
And your dear wife, Mrs. Haydon,
she faring well?
HAYDON
Mrs. Haydon is presently with
child.
TURNER
Well, you have my hearty
congratulations, Haydon.
HAYDON
Congratulations are not in order.
I’m in torment.
TURNER
I’m not unsympathetic to your
impecunity, Haydon. Therefore I
can advance you fifty pounds.

23.
HAYDON
Turner, if one hundred pounds will
not spare me from this predicament,
what in Jesu’s name can fifty
pounds do?
TURNER
Then you are refusing to accept the
fifty pounds?
HAYDON
It is damned inadequate.
TURNER
I wish you good day, sir.
Turner leaves. Haydon hesitates for a moment, then follows
him to the doorway to the expansive meadow.
HAYDON
Turner. My word is my bond. I may
not yet be an Academician, but I am
a gentleman. I have a painting
presently with the King at Windsor.
I’m assured he will buy it from me
for five hundred guineas or more.
Furthermore, I have another fine
painting in mind, a companion
piece, which he is most certain to
purchase in addition.
TURNER
Who has made these assurances?
HAYDON
The King’s private secretary,
Knighton.
Turner grunts.
TURNER
I can furnish you with five pounds
this morning.
HAYDON
Five pounds? Fifty pounds is not
sufficient. Five pounds is
tantamount to an insult.
TURNER
Sir, I beseech you, brook your ire.
If you attend my residence at
London, I will loan you fifty
pounds.

24.
HAYDON
In addition to the five?
TURNER
Mr. Haydon, you are exceedingly
tiresome.
HAYDON
I am gratified. I humbly accept
the fifty pounds. Might I find you
at the same address? I may swim.
Haydon strides off purposefully. JONES, LESLIE and BEECHEY
join Turner; they all watch Haydon recede into the distance.
JONES
‘And the spirit immediately drove
him out into the wilderness.’
LESLIE
A tormented soul, for sure. I
sympathise, but he attributes all
of his failures to anything other
than his own behaviour.
Indeed.

BEECHEY

LESLIE
His complaint with life is as
absurd as that of a spoke in a
wheel railing against the motion
that it must of necessity partake.
TURNER
I concur. He suffers the fate of
Tantalus. He reaches for the
fruit, the branch moves. When he
stoops to drink, the water goes
down.
BEECHEY
If only he would consider the
wishes of his public rather than
pursuing his own peculiar
convictions. It would be his
salvation.
LESLIE
And yet, my dear Beechey, as his
personal troubles increase, so the
quality of his painting suffers.

25.
BEECHEY
But, still, the man can paint.
For sure.

LESLIE
He can paint a Haydon.

JONES
The return of one prodigal is worth
more than gold.
BEECHEY
An essential quality for a
prodigal, sir, is humility.
TURNER
He is a cracked pot.
for a fall.

He’s heading

He goes off into the house.
LESLIE
Gentleman, are we as one?
BEECHEY
Sadly. I cannot give him my
support. He is not of our temper.
JONES
Alas, the Academy does not have
need of Haydon so much as Haydon
has need of the Academy.
They leave. Haydon is still visible on the distant horizon,
striding towards the lake.

...

Exterior. Petworth House. A moonlit night. Bright lights
in the house. Two men stroll along the terrace. A piano is
playing inside.
In the large candle-lit room, a concert is being given to a
large, enthusiastic audience. Turner is sketching.
The first of the two young ladies we saw earlier is singing a
song by Rossini (in English). She is accompanied by Miss
Coggins.

26.
Lord Egremont enters. Everybody stands, including Turner,
but he beckons them all to sit. The songs ends, to much
applause.
The Second Young Lady enters the room, and rushes over to her
friend. They giggle together.
A YOUNG MAN gets up and speaks.
YOUNG MAN
With Your Lordship’s permission,
ladies and gentlemen, our next
offering, we hope, is of a somewhat
more playful nature.
LORD EGREMONT
Playful as you wish.
Thank you.

YOUNG MAN

He picks up a clarinet and proceeds to play it badly. The
First Young Lady and Miss Coggins are put out. Turner winces
in an amused way.
FIRST YOUNG LADY
(Singing)
I’m a poor simple girl
So excuse me, sir, pray.
I am just one and twenty
the first of next May.
I never do harm,
but I tend to my farm.
I'm up early and late,
and though humble my state.
I don't envy my betters
but bear 'em good will.
And I’m called Pretty Kitty Pretty Kitty,
Pretty Kitty,
The maid of the mill.
I have lovers in plenty
Come hither to woo.
If they will be so teasing,
pray what can I do?
I'm good-tempered
and kind and a youth to my mind
Who is open and free
would be happy with me But they all are so stupid
that none of them will
Pop the question to Kitty Pretty Kitty The maid of the mill.

27.
All have been much amused throughout the course of the song,
although, to Turner’s wry amusement, a SMALL ECCLESIASTICAL
MAN ran out in disgust at the “lovers in plenty”. Loud
applause at the end.
...

On a steamer at sea. Turner, his bag on his shoulder, picks
his way through the passengers. A FIDDLER plays a nautical
tune. Turner goes up some stairs to the upper deck. He
stands by an UNHAPPY YOUNG COUPLE. The youth is trying to
coax his grumpy partner. She is having none of it, and
leaves. The embarrassed young man tips his hat at Turner,
and follows her. Turner watches as the Fiddler concludes.
Applause. The Fiddler bows.
...

Now Turner is at a busy seaside town, on the seafront.
Passing fish and vegetable vendors, and many folk out
strolling or chatting, he stops by a small house, and
inspects it. He reads a card in the window. An ELDERLY MAN
is sitting on a stool, smoking his pipe.
TURNER
Good day to you, sir.
MAN
Good day to thee.
TURNER
You be a lodgings, then?
MAN
It be, yes.
TURNER
(Indicating an upstairs
room)
This chamber, ‘tis available?
It is.

TURNER
May I peruse it?
Taking his time, the man gets up and goes into the house.
calls to a woman who is beating a rug in the back yard.
Turner looks out to sea.

He

28.
MAN
Mrs. Booth! There be a gentleman.
MRS BOOTH stops beating the rug, and comes to the front door.
MRS BOOTH
Good day to you, sir.
TURNER
Good day to you, madam.
MRS BOOTH
Are you seeking lodgings?
TURNER
Indeed I am.
MRS BOOTH
Here, Mr Booth.
She gives her husband the wicker carpet beater.
TURNER
Your top front, ‘tis available?
MRS BOOTH
Maybe, sir, yes.
TURNER
May I peruse it?
MRS BOOTH
Indeed, sir. If you’d care to

They enter a bright room with a double bed.
MRS BOOTH
There. This be my bettermost
chamber.
TURNER
Exceeding homely.
MRS BOOTH
I do thank you, sir. You’re
looking at the finest view in
Margate. They do say this town be
the first place in England the sun

Now, all my linen is freshly aired,
clean and sweet-smelling, and I can
lay a fire for you should you
require. Now, sir, my terms is one
guinea for the week with no meals
or full board for an extra fifteen
and sixpence. And I’m afraid I do
have to ask for a small deposit and
a reference.
Turner gives her a bank note.
MRS BOOTH
Five pounds!

I can’t take this, sir.

MRS BOOTH
I do thank ye, sir. Well, I should
introduce myself. My name is Mrs.

TURNER
Beg your pardon?

MRS BOOTH
I was asking your name, sir.
Mallard.

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Mr. Mallard. Well, I do hope
you’ll be most comfortable here,
Mr. Mallard. Now, is there
anything else I can provide for
you?
TURNER
A small bowl of water, madam, if
you’d be so kind.
MRS BOOTH
Might that be a glass of water?
No.

TURNER
A bowl.

MRS BOOTH
Very well, sir. I shall bring that
up for you.
She leaves.

A few minutes later, she climbs the stairs, holding a bowl.
Turner is in the bedroom. She knocks on the door.
Yes?

MRS BOOTH
Good. Oh, dear. Do be coming
along blowing now. Well, I shall
serve your supper downstairs in the
parlour at six of the clock. And
if you ever feel the need of a bit
of company, you’d be more than
welcome to join Mr. Booth and I in
our kitchen.

Turner proceeds to unpack his work materials.

...

Later. Turner sits at the table by the window in Mrs Booth’s
parlour, looking out to sea. He is eating his supper. Mrs
Booth enters with a jug.
MRS BOOTH
I’ll top up your ale, Mr. Mallard.
TURNER
Thank you kindly, madam.
She pours the beer.
MRS BOOTH
I hope you’re enjoying your supper.
Mmm.

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Oh, good. Some folk do find
shackles too salty for their taste.
TURNER
Can never be too salty for me,
madam.
Mrs Booth giggles.

32.

...

Turner skips along a wide, empty beach.

...

Later. Dusk. In Mr and Mrs Booth’s kitchen. Turner sits at
the table, Mr Booth by the fireplace. Mrs Booth brings in
two glasses of sherry, and gives one to Turner.
MRS BOOTH
There, Mr. Mallard. This’ll warm
you up. No, no, sit yourself down.
I can squeeze around here, just
about, these days. So, you had a
good walk, then?
MR BOOTH
As far as Broadstairs and back.
MRS BOOTH
Oh, dear. That is a long way.
You’ll sleep well tonight.
TURNER
Your very good health, madam.

Sir.

MRS BOOTH
Very good health to you too, sir.
TURNER
Will you not take a drink yourself?
MR BOOTH
I ain’t touched a drop this many a
long year.
MRS BOOTH
He did used to enjoy a tipple,
though that were long before I knew
him.
TURNER
Man of the sea?

MRS BOOTH
He was, weren’t he?
MR BOOTH
Ship’s carpenter.
TURNER
Carpenter? Noble craft. What did
you ply? Whalers? Spicers?
Traders?
Slavers.

MR BOOTH
For my sins.

MRS BOOTH
He don’t like to talk about it,
though.
MR BOOTH
Africa, Zanzibar, the Indies. Such
terrible sufferings I did see.
Treated like animals, they was.

The howling sound of sorrow.

Changed my life, it did.

MRS BOOTH
It did there.

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Humans can be dreadful cruel. I
watch them boys down there in the
sands whipping them poor donkeys.
Mind you, you’re better off being a
donkey than them wretched souls on
the slave ships. So, are you
familiar with Margate, Mr. Mallard?
As a boy.

Another busy London street.

A LADY knocks at Turner’s front door. Hannah opens it.

Mrs Somerville is sitting with

TURNER SNR
Have you come far, Mrs Somerville?
MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh, yes, indeed. All the way from
Chelsea. I took the steamer to
Westminster; about an hour.
TURNER SNR
Was the river busy?
MRS SOMERVILLE
Extremely. You can see the whole
world on the Thames.
Turner enters.
TURNER
Mrs Somerville.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Good afternoon, Mr. Turner.
TURNER
My apologies if I have forced you
to wait upon me.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Not at all. I have enjoyed a most
pleasant interlude with your
father.
TURNER
You find yourself well?
MRS SOMERVILLE
Passing fair, thank you. And you?

36.
TURNER
Indeed. Doctor Somerville
likewise?
MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh, yes, he’s much engaged in
administering to the poor veterans.
Well, now, it’s a beautiful sunny
day. Just perfect for our
experiment. I have everything I
need here in my wee bag.
TURNER SNR
Are we going to witness an
explosion?
MRS SOMERVILLE
Goodness me, no, I hope not.
TURNER
I’m astounded you have all your
paraphernalia contained in yon
small pouch.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed it is, Mr. Turner.
Everything except God’s good
sunlight.
TURNER
Daddy, Mrs Somerville is a natural
philosopher.
TURNER SNR
Is she, now?
TURNER
Mathematician, astronomer,
geologist.
MRS SOMERVILLE
The universe is a wondrous thing,
is it not, Mr. Turner?
TURNER SNR
It is, to be sure.
MRS SOMERVILLE
The planets and the stars. The
oceans and the tides. The clouds
and the air. Mountains, volcanoes.

37.
TURNER SNR
The tides be subject to the effect
of the moon.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Quite so. The mysterious force of
gravity. It is my strong belief
that all things on this earth are
connected. Nothing exists in
isolation.
Indeed.

TURNER

TURNER SNR
The rain falls, the sun shines and
the onions grow.
Oh, yes.

MRS SOMERVILLE

TURNER
Daddy likes to affect the pretence
of being a dunce. He is in fact a
man of high intellect. He taught
me to read and write.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Is that so?
TURNER SNR
Education is an important thing.
MRS SOMERVILLE
It is indeed most important for
everyone. I myself am presently
engaged in the tutoring of my
children.
TURNER
That is indeed commendable.
Hannah has entered with the tea tray.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Which is a privilege that was not
afforded to me. I am an
uneducated, self-taught Scotch
woman.
TURNER
Mrs Somerville, you are what you
are, as are we, Daddy.

38.

True.

TURNER SNR

Hannah gives Mrs Somerville a cup of tea.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Thank you. And what was your
profession, Mr. Turner?
TURNER
Daddy was the finest barber in
Covent Garden.
TURNER SNR
I had some success in the business.
TURNER
Wigmaker. He was a master of the
razor and the brush.
MRS SOMERVILLE
You’re the master of the brush now,
Mr. Turner.
Hannah gives the old man his tea.
TURNER SNR
My little lad could draw afore he
could read and write.
TURNER
Sat in the corner of the shop
scratching away with the chalk and
charcoal.
TURNER SNR
I’d stick his pictures in the
window.
TURNER
And sell ‘em, all of ‘em.
TURNER SNR
For two or three shillings apiece
on occasion.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Do you have children yourself, Mr.
Turner.
TURNER
I do not, Mrs Somerville.
Hannah and Turner Snr barely exchange looks.

39.

...

A little later in Turner’s studio. Turner and his father are
assisting Mrs Somerville as she organises her experiment.
Hannah looks on.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Thank you, Mr. Turner. Have you
ever seen a prism?
TURNER SNR
I have not.
She produces one from her bag.
MRS SOMERVILLE
There it is.
TURNER SNR
That is a thing of beauty.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Shortly you shall witness a rainbow
passing through it.
She places it on the window frame.
TURNER
Sir Isaac Newton, Daddy.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Gentlemen, might I request that you
close the shutters, please?
The proceed to do so.
TURNER
Daddy. Tell us when to cease, Mrs
Somerville.
MRS SOMERVILLE
We need to create an aperture to
strengthen the colours. There.
Daddy.

TURNER

They stop closing the shutters.

40.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Let us put the paper in place.
TURNER
Daddy, some tacks for Mrs
Somerville.
MRS SOMERVILLE
No, no tacks, Mr. Turner. The
metal could contaminate the
experiment. A wee nub of wax.
Paper.
Taking the wax from a small tin, she attaches a sheet of
paper to an easel they have placed on the table. Then she
tears off a tiny corner of paper.
TURNER
And what is the purpose of the
small piece of paper?
MRS SOMERVILLE
I shall cover the bottom half of
the needle so that it is not
exposed.

And what is it you are about now,
Mrs Somerville?
MRS SOMERVILLE
You’ll have to wait and see, won’t
you?
TURNER
Daddy, I wager that is the first
time you’ve witnessed a hammer
being produced from a lady’s
reticule.
TURNER SNR
For certain, ‘tis.
Mrs Somerville now hammers the folded cloth vigorously.
TURNER
You have the arm of a blacksmith,
Mrs Somerville.

41.
MRS SOMERVILLE
There, now. That has thrown all
those wee particles into chaos.
TURNER SNR
Particles into chaos!
TURNER
Mrs Somerville, what is the element
contained within the violet light
such as magnetises the material?
MRS SOMERVILLE
That is what as yet, Mr. Turner, I
do not know.
TURNER
The majesty of mystery.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed. Now, let us allow nature
to take its course. Although we
will have to adjust the position of
the easel from time to time.

Indeed. As mighty Apollo moves

Do as you wish. View as you wish.
Mrs Somerville looks at two paintings of ships.

42.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh, my. These are breathtaking,
are they not? My dear late father
would have much appreciated them.
TURNER
A naval man, I believe.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed, he was a vice admiral.

TURNER SNR
So you are an artist, Mrs.

MRS SOMERVILLE
I don’t think we can quite use that
term in the presence of Mr. Turner.
TURNER
Nevertheless, Daddy, Mrs.
Somerville is a fine
watercolourist.
MRS SOMERVILLE
You flatter me. What an epic
storm.
TURNER
Rock crushing a house in
Switzerland. Calais sands, women
digging for bait. I don’t care for
that much.

MRS SOMERVILLE
What have we here?

TURNER
It’s Hannibal crossing the Alps.
TURNER SNR
Do you see the elephant?
MRS SOMERVILLE
An elephant?
TURNER SNR
He’s in there somewhere.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Are you teasing me, Mr. Turner?
TURNER SNR
By no means, madam. Can you find
him?
Mrs Somerville scrutinises the painting very closely.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Well, no, I cannot.

44.
TURNER SNR
There he is.
He points out the tiny elephant in the distance. She laughs.
TURNER
Daddy’s little jest.
MRS SOMERVILLE
‘Tis a terrifying scene.

...

Back in the studio, Hannah watches from a distance as Mrs
Somerville, with the aid of the needle floating in a bowl of
water, demonstrates her experiment to the Turners.
MRS SOMERVILLE
There. Shall I make it do a wee
dance? So, the end of the needle
that was exposed to the violet
light has produced a magnetic north
pole.
TURNER SNR
Like a compass.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Exactly so. Whereas, Mr. Turner,
had I done the same experiment
using the red end of the spectrum,
this needle would not have been
magnetised. I have from time to
time, attempted it with the green
and the blue, and it has succeeded
on occasion, but not consistently.
TURNER
Colour is contradictory.
MRS SOMERVILLE
Well, is it, Mr. Turner? Colour is
absolute.

45.
TURNER
Sublime but contradictory, yet
harmonious.
MRS SOMERVILLE
You are a man of great vision, Mr.
Turner. The universe is chaotic
and you make us see it. In natural
philosophy nothing can ever be
proved, only disproved.
TURNER
The purity of your prism, the
contamination of my palette.
Natural light, blackness. White is
the power of good, black is the
devil.

At the Royal Academy. The lecture theatre. Turner addresses
a full house. Mostly men, a few women. Turner Snr sits on
the front row, next to an ELDERLY MAN with an ear trumpet.
TURNER
Transparent bodies depend so much
upon what is opposed to them,
having no colour, that they take
every on e offered. Water often
possesses colour, but colour is not
imparted to its reflections or
refractions, like a coloured glass
when everything seen is vitiated by
that colour. Even the purest
mirror gives a tone to the sky, and
as the colour is increased, it
destroys all the colour of nature

Turner walks briskly down another bustling London street.

...

Turner’s house. In his workshop, Turner Snr is stretching a
canvas. He is coughing badly. This gets worse; he stops
working, and staggers out of the room.

Turner enters his house, and, without having taken off his
hat and coat, he rushes upstairs to his father’s bedroom.
Comforted by Hannah, the old man is sitting on the side of

Tears well up in Turner’s eyes.

Fraught, Hannah comes and stands near Turner.

In small boat by a river bank. Turner is fishing with a rod
and line. He sits still, sad and reflective.

...

Some rough outdoor corner of London. Turner strides past men
and women of all ages and classes, mostly sitting. They look
as though they are waiting for something.
Turner ascends a rickety wooden staircase, passing a couple
of men.

49.
He enters a brothel. The BROTHEL KEEPER, a middle-aged
woman, is sitting on a sofa. A YOUNG WOMAN sits in the
corner.
BROTHEL KEEPER
Good afternoon, sir.
TURNER
Good day to you, madam.
BROTHEL KEEPER
It’s been a long while, ain’t it?
Yeah.

BROTHEL KEEPER
May I offer you a refreshment?
TURNER
No, thank you kindly.
BROTHEL KEEPER

all my lovely girls are occupied.
But we do have young Eliza here,

In a corridor they pass a fully-clad man and two half-dressed

breasts out)
No, no. No. Lay upon the bed.
She lies on her back, and complies with Turner’s instructions
as he manoeuvres her into position.
TURNER
Part your legs. Crook your knee.
Right arm as thus. Hand upon the
head. No. As in despair.
He goes to the end of the bed and checks her pose. Then he
gets a chair, and places it in the same position. Having
checked the pose again, he takes a pencil and sketchbook from
his bag, and starts to draw her. Pause.
TURNER

Eliza.

In the drawing room. Hannah returns her book to a glassfronted bookcase, and chooses another book. Turner joins
her. Then he takes her from behind, the two of them standing
up, fully-clothed, pushing against the bookcase. It is over
quickly. He leaves. Her face shows pain and joy.

...

Silhouetted against the sky, Turner strides along a cliff
top. In the distance a tiny ancient chapel perches on a hilltop. A pack of wild horses emerge from nowhere and follow
Turner as he descends over the cliff top.

52.

Now, as the sun sets over the sea, Turner sits on a hillside,
drawing the view.

...

And on yet another cliff top, Turner watches the sky. A flock
of birds fly by.
...

Margate, the sea front.
Turner makes his way past the bustling marketeers and
townsfolk. He arrives at Mrs Booth’s house and knocks at the
door. After a few moments, she answers. She is dressed in
black.
MRS BOOTH
Good day, sir.

MRS BOOTH

MRS BOOTH
Well, do come in. There. It be
most pleasant to see you again.
They go in.

A little later. In her parlour, Mrs Booth is putting out a
pot of tea as Turner is coming down the stairs. He has taken
off his jacket. He comes into the room.
MRS BOOTH

condolences.
MRS BOOTH
I do thank you, sir.
TURNER
My sympathies, commiserations, for
the loss of your dear departed man.
MRS BOOTH
Well, he were a dear man. ‘Tis

myself a widow. My first husband
were taken from me when I was but a
young woman.
TURNER
How was he taken?
MRS BOOTH
He were foying over there on
Goodwin Sands.
TURNER
A life-saver.
MRS BOOTH
Aye. He did save many a life but
in the end he could not save his
own. We never did find him, poor
soul. My boy were eight year old
when he did lose his father.
TURNER
I was eight when I lost my little
sister.
MRS BOOTH
I am sorry. Well, ‘tis the way of
things.

You still making your nice little
pictures, Mr. Mallard?
TURNER

Back in London, Turner enters busily through his front door,
goes straight into his studio and proceeds to get on with
things. Hannah comes in.
Mr. Billy.

HANNAH
Welcome home.

Turner gives her a bowl.
TURNER
Dirty water.
She empties it into a bucket.

He doesn’t reply. She shrugs and goes out, picking up his
umbrella as she goes, and putting it in the hall stand.

56.

His bag on his shoulder, Turner ascends a grand staircase,
and enters a large hall, the walls of which are covered with
paintings. Men, mostly in hats and coats, are standing or
sitting or up ladders, adding the finishing touches to their
paintings. This is Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy.
Turner enters, and joins THREE SENIOR MEN, who are standing
in the middle of the room.

He proceeds to his painting (’Helvoetsluys; - the City of

ROBERTS
Good morning, Mr. Turner.
TURNER
My other piece, where is it
located?
LESLIE
We placed it in the ante-room.

58.
TURNER
The ante-room.
Turner moves away and greets Carew as he passes him.
Mr. Carew!
Turner.

CAREW

Turner joins AN ARTIST putting the finishing touches to his
painting.
Stanny.

TURNER

STANFIELD
Hello, Mr. Turner, sir.
TURNER
Is it for His Majesty?
STANFIELD
Indeed. I hope it meets his
expectations.
It will.

TURNER

Turner goes through a doorway, greeting a UNIFORMED MAN.
Grout.

TURNER

GROUT
Mr. Turner.
Turner proceeds down the corridor into the ante-room, in
which a GENTLEMAN is standing by a painting.
TURNER
Sir John Soane.
SOANE
J.M.W. Turner Esquire.
TURNER
As I live and breathe.
SOANE
My dear friend!
TURNER
Find yourself well, John?

59.
SOANE
Relishing the day.
Capital.

TURNER

SOANE
Only now I was admiring your
seascape.
(Referring to Turner’s
painting, ‘Staffa,
Fingal’s Cave’, which
hangs on the wall.)
TURNER
There she is. Mr. Pickersgill.
PICKERSGILL is a man sitting at the end of the room.
PICKERSGILL
Good morning, William.
TURNER
He has the air of despondency upon
him.
SOANE
He is slighted.
For why?

TURNER

PICKERSGILL
Yet again in the ante-room.
TURNER
They hang us where they will,
Pickers. Take a guzzle of brown
sherry.
Beechey enters and joins Turner and Soane.
BEECHEY
Damn fine storm you have there,
Billy.
TURNER
Nimbus, Sir Billy.

Nimbus.

Turner leaves the, and again returns to the main gallery,
where he again scrutinises his ‘Helvoetsluys’ painting
alongside its neighbour, Constable's ‘Waterloo Bridge’, on
which the latter continues to work.

60.
Then he joins Eastlake.
TURNER
Carlo the Salamander.
EASTLAKE
Amico mio. Harmony and unity,
William.
TURNER
(Referring to Eastlake’s
portrait of a young
woman.)
Chemise.
Chemise?

EASTLAKE

TURNER
(gesturing)
Lower!
Eastlake takes a moment to register what Turner is
suggesting. Then EASTLAKE
Molto bene!
They both laugh. Turner moves on.
Jonesy!

TURNER

Another painter intercepts him.
CALLCOTT
I want you to see What?

TURNER

CALLCOTT leads Turner to an Italian view.
Remember?
Remind me.
Pisa.

CALLCOTT
TURNER
CALLCOTT

61.

Oh, Pisa!
Gussy.

TURNER
Fine around there,

He points to part of the painting.
CALLCOTT
You think so?
Oh, yeh.

TURNER

Turner goes to Jones, who is working on a historical
painting.
TURNER

Nelson?

JONES
With two arms.
They laugh. Turner moves on. Leslie is still up the ladder.
His painting depicts a fashionable salon.
TURNER
Mr. Leslie.
LESLIE

Turner.

TURNER
(Referring to Leslie’s
painting)
Little maid, in a gamboge gown,
left foot instep, touch of
highlight.
LESLIE
Thank you, Turner.
ROBERTS
Paintings always benefit his
remarks.
Turner moves into the corridor, where Carew, Soane and
Stothard are inspecting a marble portrait on a plinth.
Carew!

TURNER
This your man?

‘Tis he.

CAREW

62.
TURNER
Sports an elegant nostril, does he
not, Sir John?
SOANE
Splendid nostrils.
CAREW
Thank you kindly.
STOTHARD
(Brandishing his ear
trumpet)
What did you say?
TURNER
Elegant pair of nostrils, Mr.
Stothard!
Oh, yes.

STOTHARD
Yes, indeed.

Carew laughs uproariously.

Turner moves on.
...

A few minutes later, in the main gallery. The Academicians
stand about, chatting quietly. Constable, sitting on a
stool, continues to apply red paint to his canvas.
Armed with a paintbrush, Turner walks briskly up to his own
grey picture, puts a bold, red, blob right in the middle, and
leaves.
The Academicians gather round the painting.
up, astonished.
SHEE
Why on earth would he go and do
that?
EASTLAKE
I believe Mr. Turner knows well
enough what he’s doing.
SHEE
You think so? He’s ruined a
masterpiece.
JONES
I think not.

Constable gets

63.
General consternation and reaction. Carew laughs
uproariously. Constable puts on his coat.
CONSTABLE
He’s been here and fired a gun.
He storms out of the gallery. The following is mixed in with
general murmur, whilst, just as Constable leaves, Haydon
enters, and looks round the whole exhibition. Carew
continues to laugh.
No, no.

SHEE

BEECHEY
John, you must not upset yourself
like this.
SHEE
The man’s impossible. I mean why
would he go and destroy a perfectly
good painting?
ROBERTS
Sheer mockery.
MAN
My sympathy’s with Constable.
BEECHEY
He’s got a damn fine picture here
and he’s made a damn mockery of it.
EASTLAKE
There’s method in the madness
gentlemen.
SHEE
If that is method it is pure
madness.
MAN
But, what is it?
SHEE
Do stop that prattling laughter,
Mr. Carew!
Carew doesn’t stop laughing.
CALLCOTT
I wager we’ve not seen the end of
this.

64.
SHEE
He may surprise us yet.
In the corridor, Haydon bumps into Turner, who is just coming
out of the ante-room.
Haydon.

TURNER
Hey!

Turner returns to the main gallery. Watched by all, and
using his forefinger, his thumb and a cloth, he turns the red
blob into a buoy.
SHEE
Ah, Mr. Turner.
BEECHEY
We were just wondering if ...
CALLCOTT
I said he wasn’t finished.
MAN
It’s a buoy.
Bravo!

SHEE
Bravo!

General celebration and applause.
sardonic look, and leaves.

Turner gives them all a
...

In the ante-room we are looking at a painting of a donkey.
PICKERSGILL
Can you explain your rendition?
HAYDON
It needs no explanation, sir. ‘Tis
our Redeemer’s conveyance into
Jerusalem, plain as day.
Blasphemy!

PICKERSGILL

Turner has returned.
TURNER
You faring well, Mr. Haydon?

65.
HAYDON
This will be the finish of me!
He storms out.
TURNER
Fifty pounds!
Turner shakes his head, and shares the moment with Soane, who
is adjacent.
Haydon marches into the main gallery. He goes up to Leslie,
who is standing with Eastlake and Callcott.
HAYDON
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir, for
your charity.
Haydon?

LESLIE

HAYDON
You have been most kind. Most kind
in your placement. You have
finished me. You might as well have
taken my painting and put it in the
outhouse. Better yet, taken it out
of this building and thrown it in
the Fleet.
A crowd gathers.

Much of the following dialogue overlaps.

SHEE
Please lower your voice, Mr.
Haydon.
LESLIE
Haydon, I am hard... hard set to
understand your indignation.
SHEE
Mr. Haydon.
HAYDON
And as... as for you, as for you,
my pupil... my pupil.
EASTLAKE
Your painting, sir, is hanging next
door to that of Mr. Turner.
LESLIE
It is in fine company.

66.
HAYDON
This is treachery. This is
treachery! And do not talk to me of
Turner's work.
JONES
Stand down, man!
SHEE
Please, please, please, please
lower your voice, Mr. Haydon.
Just...
HAYDON (OS)
His... his pictures look as if they
were painted by somebody born
without hands!
Pickersgill enters, followed by Soane and Turner, who watch
from the doorway.
SHEE
Mr. Haydon. What, what is your
quarrel?
Please.

LESLIE

HAYDON
What principles have you applied
other than those that I gave...
SHEE
Mr. Haydon, please lower your
voice.
JONES
Have a care man.
SHEE
Mr. Haydon, please... Mr. Haydon,
please lower your voice.
HAYDON
I will not, sir!
SHEE
What... What is your quarrel here?
HAYDON
I have no respect for you. I
certainly do not acknowledge your
presidency. It should have been...
It should have been Wilkie.

67.
General discussion and comments.
SHEE
Mr. Haydon, I will not have
personal attacks like this on the
Academy floor.
HAYDON
You will have what I choose to give
you, sir.
SHEE
This would be one of the many
reasons why you were never accepted
here, Mr. Haydon.
Soane and Pickersgill join the group around Haydon.
HAYDON
This man... This man has spent a
quarter of a century doing
everything in his power to malign
me.
SHEE
I have done nothing of the sort.
HAYDON
And spoil my genius.
SHEE
Please, refrain from this shouting,
Mr. Haydon.
HAYDON
I will not!
SHEE
I will have you forcibly removed.
HAYDON
Yes, do it! Do it! Remove me from
your nest of portrait painters!
Alone, Turner watches from the doorway.
JONES
Have a care!
BEECHEY
What, sir, is wrong with being a
portrait painter?

68.
SHEE
Please William. William, please
don't...
HAYDON
What does it do to elevate the
art..?
BEECHEY
I received the accolade from the
hand of His Majesty the King,
SHEE
William, don't put him up...
BEECHEY
for painting portraits and damn
good ones too, sir!
HAYDON
Oh, God, I bow to him!
PICKERSGILL
Haydon, can I point out that I too
hang in the inferior chamber?
HAYDON
I care not for your work, sir. I
care not a fig.
PICKERSGILL
At least my work does not represent
self-portrait as ass.
SHEE
Mr. Pickersgill...!
HAYDON
Give me those...
Haydon knocks Pickersgill’s hat off.
ensues
Unhand me!

HAYDON

SHEE
Remove this man!
HAYDON
(shouting)
You swines! You swines!
Turner quietly leaves the gallery.

A general struggle

69.
SOANE
Mr. Haydon, sir: with deep regret I
must inform you that I am on my way
to the porters unless you feel free
to leave of your own volition.
HAYDON
Shh... shh...
SOANE
Please, sir.
HAYDON
Stretch me no longer on this rough
world. I am done with you.
He makes his way through the crowd, and leaves.
General discussion and hubbub.
...

A little later, in the ante-room. Watched by a large group
of amused and enthralled Academicians, Turner works further
on his painting, ‘Staffa’, vigorously stabbing the canvas
with his brush, wiping it with a cloth, spitting at the
painting, and blowing brown powder at it.
...

In a rocky, mountainous landscape, Turner walks and climbs,
and stops to survey the scene.

...

At Margate, Turner wends his way through the busy vendors and
passers by on the seafront. He arrives at Mrs Booth’s house,
where she is cleaning her windows. He makes her jump with
surprise. They exchange greetings, and enter the house.

...
In Mrs Booth’s parlour, Turner is seated on the sofa, Mrs
Booth by the window. They are drinking sherry.

70.
MRS BOOTH
Hmm. 'Tis nice to have a bit of
company for a change. So you had a
good walk, then? Weren't too chippy
up there by Reculver?
TURNER
Somewhat blowy and the wind did
kick up some white horses.
MRS BOOTH
Can do, this time of year. In
summertime, though, 'tis a lovely
calm spot for a picnic up there by
the Two Sisters. But in wintertime,
I have known the whole of Marine
Terrace, down here, without a pane
of glass left in the entire place.
Oh, the glaziers do get rich.
TURNER
(laughs)
Hmm...
MRS BOOTH
When Mr. Booth and I moved in here,
we had the whole place polished up,
spick and span, ready for our first
visitors, and the wind did blow and
the sea come up. We had broken
glass everywhere. It were terrible.
TURNER
Mrs. Booth, would you be so kind as
to look out of the window?
MRS BOOTH
Where? What am I looking at?
TURNER
From the tip of your nose to the
bridge, to the curve of your brow,
you put me in mind of a Greek
sculpture I'm familiar with, of
Aphrodite, goddess of love.
MRS BOOTH
No... No one's ever said that about
my nose before. This old snout.
Hmm.

TURNER

71.
MRS BOOTH
Truth to tell, my eyes aren't so
good these days, so when I do look
in the looking-glass I be glad I
cannot see so well.
TURNER
When I peruse myself in the lookingglass, I see a gargoyle.
MRS BOOTH:
Now, you be fishing for
compliments, and my old Ma used to
say, them that fish for compliments
don't get none. Besides, 'tis
what's within a person that do
matter. I do not know you, Mr.
Mallard, and I'm sure there be
things about you that are beyond my
understanding. But I believe you to
be a man of great spirit and fine
feeling.
TURNER
Mrs. Booth... you are a woman of
profound beauty.
MRS BOOTH
Mr. Mallard... I am lost for words.
Hmm.

TURNER

A long pause. A charged moment.
...

Later. Holding a lantern, Mrs Booth climbs the stairs.
carries Turner’s boots.
MRS BOOTH
Good night, Mr. Mallard, sir. I've
cleaned your boots for'ee. They're
by the door here.
She puts them outside his door, which he opens.
TURNER
Mrs. Booth, I thank you for a most
convivial evening.

She

72.
MRS BOOTH
I do thank you too, sir.
Turner pulls her towards him.

They kiss.

She takes him by his hand and leads him into her bedroom, and
closes her door.

...

Next morning. Turner leaves Mrs Booth’s house. As he walks
along the seafront, the sun rises over the bay.

...

Dusk. On a ship in the pouring rain.

A MARINER is tying

Turner absorbs the full

DOCTOR is listening to Turner’s chest, as he inhales and
wheezes.
And out.
Turner coughs.

DR PRICE

73.
DR PRICE
Cover yourself up. Good man. Well,
Mr. Mallard is suffering from
bronchitis.
Oh, there.

MRS BOOTH

DR PRICE
For which we prescribe the three
Bs: bed, balsam and broth.
Oh.

MRS BOOTH

DR PRICE
To be administered in this case by
the fourth B, the admirable Mrs.
Booth.
Mrs Booth laughs.
DR PRICE
Thank you. Now, Mrs. Booth, if you
would be so good as to come up to
the house after four, I shall have
the balsam prepared.
MRS BOOTH
Indeed I shall, sir.
DR PRICE
Good day, Mr. Mallard. Rest the
body, sir, and the soul shall find
solace.
MRS BOOTH
I do thank ye, Doctor. Let me show
ye out.
DR PRICE
Good day to you, Mrs. Booth.
Mrs Booth sees Dr Price out.
MRS BOOTH
Good day to you, sir.
Turner coughs heavily into his handkerchief.
...

74.
In his studio, Turner is painting “Snow Storm - Steam-Boat
off a Harbour’s Mouth”.

...

Now he enters his gallery. A middle-aged man and a young man
are looking at a painting - “Slavers throwing overboard the
Dead and Dying - Typhoon coming on”. They are JOHN RUSKIN
and his FATHER.
Gentlemen.

TURNER

RUSKIN
Ah, Mr. Turner. My father and I
are marvelling at this glorious
work. Er, might I be correct in
remembering that we had the good
fortune of viewing it at the
Academy last summer?
Indeed.

TURNER

RUSKIN
Well, I must say, it is no less
impressive on its second viewing...
Perhaps, even more so. Is it not,
Father?
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Indeed so. I recall it provoked
much heated and stimulating
discussion long after our viewing.
TURNER
It did not sell.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Indeed not?
TURNER
No, Mr. Ruskin.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
I'm astonished.
RUSKIN
But it is a masterpiece.

75.
TURNER
Thackeray reviles it.
How so?

RUSKIN

TURNER
Sublime or ridiculous, he says.
RUSKIN
Well, perhaps he should make up his
mind.
TURNER
He has a sharp and cynical tongue.
RUSKIN
There is no place for cynicism in
the reviewing of art.
TURNER
Hmm... 'tis of no consequence.
Quite.

RUSKIN

TURNER
It is purchasable?
Enticing.
Perhaps.

RUSKIN
RUSKIN'S FATHER

TURNER

Typhus epidemic amongst the cargo slaves. Die on board - no
insurance. Sling 'em in the drink drowned dead - cash.
RUSKIN
I am struck by the column of bright
white placed precisely off centre
here, applied over the darkened
background impasto contrasting with
the scarlet and ochre hues in the
upper left corner, which in turn
contrasts with the presence of God,
revealing to us that hope exists
even in the most turbulent and
illimitable of deaths.

During the above speech, she yawns and

TURNER
Bluebottles.
Eh?

HANNAH

TURNER
Up in the muslin. Knock 'em out.
HANNAH
Well, I didn't put 'em there.
She gets up and goes out.
RUSKIN
Would it not sit splendidly above
the fireplace in the library,
Father?
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Er, it would, but I fear it may be
beyond our purse, John.
No.

RUSKIN

TURNER
I'm sure some arrangement can be
come to, sir.
Hannah returns, holding a large stick, from which she draws a
sword.
HANNAH
Mind your heads.
She pokes the ceiling drape with the sword.
TURNER
You're just... You're just knocking
'em up and down. Scrape 'em out.
No, look... Now you've just knocked
it over there.
Bemused, the Ruskins watch this operation.

Margate. Turner sketches boats outside Mrs Booth’s house.
She arrives with a shopping basket and joins him for a few
moments.

...

Mrs Booth is sweeping her front doorway. Turner comes down
the stairs. They both look out at the view.
MRS BOOTH
There. 'Tis a nice day for'ee.
He kisses her.
TURNER
Au revoir, madame.
She giggles. Turner leaves, immediately reappearing, going
the other way.
TURNER
T'other way.
He disappears.

A woman passes.

MRS BOOTH
Morning, Mrs. Stokes.
Morning.

MRS STOKES
...

Turner and Mrs Booth walk down some seaside steps in Margate.
Suddenly, Turner collapses.

Mrs Booth rushes to his rescue.

...

Turner is in bed in Mrs Booth’s house. Dr Price is
unbuttoning Turner’s shirt, watched by Mrs Booth, who is
standing at the end of the bed.

78.
TURNER
Dr. Price, Mrs. Booth has summoned
you here under false pretences.
MRS BOOTH
Shh! Let the doctor do his work.
DR PRICE
Breathe in.
Turner does so, and coughs.
DR PRICE
Breathe out.
Turner does so.
DR PRICE
Have you been exerting yourself
unduly, Mr. Mallard?
TURNER
No more than is usual, sir.
DR PRICE
Remind me again, what is your
profession?
TURNER
Master of Chancery.
DR PRICE
Breathe in.
Turner does so.
DR PRICE
Forgive me, sir, but I beg to
differ. Breathe out.
Turner does so.
DR PRICE
I suggest that you are Mr. Turner,
the illustrious painter, and I am
greatly honoured to make your
acquaintance.
Hmm.

TURNER

79.
DR PRICE
My apologies to you both, but rest
assured that my discretion can be
relied upon.
As the doctor turns his back on them to attend to his bag,
Turner and Mrs Booth exchange startled looks, and mouth words
of consternation.
DR PRICE
Now, allow me to examine your eyes.
The eyes of a master. Open wide.
(He inspects Turner’s eye)
Hmm-mm. Look up. Hmm. Mr.
Turner, you are suffering from a
disorder of the heart. There is no
immediate cause for concern, Mrs.
Booth, but he will have to be
careful.
Oh, dear.

MRS BOOTH

DR PRICE
Live moderately sir, and you shall
enjoy a long and fruitful life.
Exert yourself unduly and you will
go to an early grave.
MRS BOOTH
Oh, dear. There, now.
Hmm.

TURNER
...

In Turner’s house, Sarah Danby and Evelina stand in the
drawing room. They are dressed in black. Hannah stands with
them. Enter Turner. He joins them, hands clasped behind his
back. They all remain standing. Pause.
SARAH DANBY
Good day, sir.
Hmm.

TURNER

SARAH DANBY
Have you nothing to say to me?

80.
TURNER
I am most sorry for your loss.
EVELINA
Our loss, Father?
SARAH DANBY
Your own dear daughter's funeral.
Indeed.

EVELINA

TURNER
I did not find myself in the city.
SARAH DANBY
As ever, sir, painting your
ridiculous shipwrecks.
Hmm.

TURNER

SARAH DANBY
Have you no feelings? Speak!
Long pause.
SARAH DANBY
Come, Evelina, there is nothing
here for us.
Sarah sweeps out. She now has a walking stick, and is
limping. Evelina accompanies her, followed by Hannah.
Alone, Turner sobs.

Night.

Mrs Booth and Turner are in her bed.
MRS BOOTH
You're tired, my dear.
Hmm.

TURNER

81.
MRS BOOTH
'Tis too much of a strain for you
these days, trawling back and forth
on that old steamer every time you
wants to see me. And even when
they finish building that new
railway, we none of us do know what
lies ahead. I have bethought me of
a plan, and here's what we must do.
If you will find a little house for
us, somewhere by your beloved River
Thames, but not too far from London
Town, with good solid wooden
floors, nice bright light for you
to work by... then I will buy the
lease. I can sell this house. I
think we would be happy. The two
of us.

Sunset on the River Thames.
by a steam tug.

The HMS Temeraire is being towed

Turner, Stanfield and Roberts are in a small boat, being
rowed by two men. The artists are swigging beer from stone
bottles.
TURNER
There she is!
STANFIELD
The saucy ‘Temeraire.’
TURNER
Going to her death, I fear.
ROBERTS
She's served her time.
STANFIELD
The auctioneer's hammer has struck
that final blow.
Indeed.

TURNER

STANFIELD
If not for her, the ‘Victory’ might
never again have seen our shores.
ROBERTS
Aye, nor the body of Lord Nelson.

82.
TURNER
The little saviour of Trafalgar.
STANFIELD
They say five thousand oaks went
into making that ship.
ROBERTS
Now she's destined to be reduced to
five thousand tables and chairs.
TURNER
To be sat on by five thousand fat
arses.
Roberts, Stanfield and Turner laugh.
STANFIELD
Gentlemen, a toast. Raise your pot
of grog. To the fine, fighting
‘Temeraire'!
They all raise their drinks.
TURNER
The ‘Temeraire!’
ROBERTS
‘Temeraire!’
TURNER
Here's to her.
They drink.
ROBERTS
A ghost of the past.
TURNER
No, Rabbie. The past is the past.
We're observing the future. Smoke.
Iron. Steam.....
STANFIELD
She'd make a fine subject for you
to paint, Turner.
TURNER
Oh, is that so, Stanny? I shall
cogitate upon it... Thank you.
Yeh, yeh...
The others laugh.

83.

...

In his studio, Turner is working on ‘The Fighting Temeraire’.
Hannah enters.
HANNAH
It's that Mr. Haydon.
Turner growls.
HANNAH
He's brought a cold blast of air in
with him.
She goes out. Turner continues working.
...

A few minutes later.
Haydon is waiting.

Turner enters his drawing room, where

TURNER
Mr. Haydon. To what do I owe the
honour of your presence this
morning?
HAYDON
I trust that this is not an
inconvenience to you, Turner.
Turner growls.
HAYDON
Now, will you accept ten pounds?
TURNER
Ten pounds, sir?
HAYDON
I wish to be free of the debt. It
weighs heavily upon me.
TURNER
Sir, you owe me fifty pounds.
HAYDON
Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle. I
have been giving my lecture.
(MORE)

84.
HAYDON (CONT'D)
Edinburgh. Fair city. Only in
London is my genius not
appreciated. Consider this as a
statement of intent.
TURNER
Mr. Haydon: pray be seated.
HAYDON
I had rather not. I do not wish to
prevail upon your time more than is
necessary.
TURNER
And I prevail upon you, sir, to
take a seat.
HAYDON
Well, where would you have me sit?
TURNER
Wherever you wish.
HAYDON
Will this suffice?
TURNER
Indeed. Mr. Haydon, do you still
find yourself in a position of
impecuniousness?
Haydon has sat down.
HAYDON
Impecunity. Turner, that has been
my constant state these thirty
years.
(Looking round)
You are most well-appointed here. I
do not recall the last time we had
as much coal in our scuttle as
that. I fear we shall be burning
our furniture this winter.
TURNER
Does Mrs. Haydon find herself
faring well?
HAYDON
She does not. She has not
recovered. I fear that she may
never do so.

85.
TURNER
What ails her, sir?
HAYDON
We have buried five children.
Indeed?

TURNER

HAYDON
Paddington Old Churchyard. They
remove the soil, extract the
coffins, dig the hole deeper, then
re-inter the coffins with another
atop. Five times she has had to
suffer that indignity.
TURNER
'Tis pitiable.
HAYDON
It is pitiable, Turner. You have
never had to endure the loss of a
child.
Pause.
TURNER
I have not, sir.
Hannah registers this.

She is standing by the door.

HAYDON
A dying child, 'tis a potent
subject for a painting, is it not?
And what is your present endeavour,
Turner?
TURNER
Marine piece.
HAYDON
A marine piece? Do not you tire of
boats and the fiery firmament?
TURNER
I do not, sir.
HAYDON
(Laughing drily)
Sometimes I consider it might make
a better course for me were I to
set light to the house.

HAYDON (CONT'D)
with my wife, my surviving children
and myself within it. Then they
would no longer be saddled with me.
TURNER
Your pain is your own, sir. Do not
inflict it upon your loved ones.
HAYDON
Will you take my ten pounds?
TURNER
I will not, sir. You are free of
your debt.
HAYDON
Free? How so?
TURNER
'Tis expunged.
HAYDON
Er - no, sir. I do not come here a
seeker after charity or pity.
TURNER
You have neither charity nor pity
nor debt.
HAYDON:
I do not wish it in such a
circumstance.
TURNER
Mr. Haydon, I am much preoccupied.
Me damsel, be so kind as to escort
the gentleman into the street.
Good day to you, sir.
HAYDON
This does not sit well with me,
Turner.

He stumbles down

Damn his eyes.
Hannah watches him go, then closes the door.

Turner and Jones arrive at a large, well-appointed house
Turner raps on the door with his umbrella.
In the hall of the house, which is the home of the Ruskins, a
FOOTMAN opens the door.
TURNER
Turner and Jones.
Ruskin’s Father bustles into the hall to greet them.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Mr. Turner. Captain Jones.
pleasure to see you.

It's a

TURNER
Mr. Ruskin.
JONES
Good evening to you.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
I trust you had a pleasant journey?
TURNER
Indeed. You find yourself well,
sir?
Now there are two footmen.

They take the guests’ coats.

RUSKIN'S FATHER
I do indeed, thank you. Pride of
place, Mr. Turner.
He is referring to ‘Slavers’ which now hangs on the wall.
They all turn to look at it.
Oh...

TURNER

JONES
Ah, splendid.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
As though the house was built
around it.
Turner mutters politely.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Please, come through. Come through.

88.
They all proceed through a doorway.
Jones to go first.
Jonesy.

Turner gestures for

TURNER
...

In the Ruskin’s drawing room. Turner, Jones, Roberts,
Stanfield, John Ruskin and his father and MOTHER are all
sitting in a formal circle.
RUSKIN'S MOTHER
My good husband is of the opinion
that the gooseberry prefers the
colder climate, whereas I consider
that all fruits benefit from the
warmth.
JONES
My dear late mother always insisted
that both the gooseberry and the
rhubarb favour the colder climes of
our victorious isles.
RUSKIN'S FATHER
I do not doubt that the gooseberry
for its preference may enjoy the
warm. However, I am convinced that
a cold start promotes the more
vigorous specimen.
RUSKIN
Are we not to take as empirical
evidence our many expeditions to
the warmer climes of the
Mediterranean, where we do not
exactly encounter an abundance of
gooseberries?
RUSKIN'S FATHER
(laughing)
Ha! Indeed.
ROBERTS
Exactly so. I did not myself savour
many gooseberries in Jerusalem.
RUSKIN'S MOTHER
Ah, the Holy City, Mister Turner.

89.
ROBERTS
And yet we do enjoy fine
gooseberries in Scotland, do we
not, Mr. Ruskin?
RUSKIN'S FATHER
Aye, and no better a cold start
than a good Scottish sun.
Stanfield and Roberts laugh.
ROBERTS
Exactly that.
STANFIELD
Surely regardless of how cold the
start of the life of the gooseberry
might be, it is almost certainly
destined for a warm ending.
JONES
To which we have all borne witness
in Mrs. Ruskin's excellent
gooseberry pie.
A general murmur of agreement.
RUSKIN'S MOTHER
I thank you, Captain Jones.
STANFIELD
Hear, hear.
RUSKIN
May I propose as a topic for
discussion the question as to the
depiction of the seas and the
oceans in pictorial art?
Turner groans.
RUSKIN
Now, I, I appreciate that I am
honoured to be in the presence of
two of our most distinguished
marine painters, Mr. Turner and Mr.
Stanfield. Not to forget er,
Captain Jones and Mr. Roberts of
course, whose, er, realisations are
confined to mere naked terra firma,
exemplary though they are.
Hmm.

TURNER

90.
RUSKIN
Erm... My point being that, alas, I
find myself harbouring a perhaps
rather controversial opinion
regarding the long deceased Claude.
Indeed?

JONES

RUSKIN
I am afraid so, Captain Jones. I
must confess that I find his
rendering of the sea rather
insipid, dull and uninspiring.
STANFIELD
That is an extremely bold
statement, young Mr. Ruskin.
RUSKIN
Thank you very much.
TURNER
Claude was a man of his time.
RUSKIN
My point exactly, Mr. Turner, but
that time is now long past. When I
experience a modern masterpiece
such as yours, I am struck by the
clarity with which you have
captured the moment. Take for
example, your ‘Slave Ship: Slavers
Throwing Overboard the Dead and
Dying - Typhoon Coming On', by
which I have the good fortune to be
greeted every morning on my way in
to my meagre breakfast. The impact
of the foaming brine incarnadine
consuming those unfortunate Negro
slaves never ceases to quicken the
beat of my heart. Yet, when I gaze
upon a work of Claude I find myself
enduring nothing more than a mere
collection of precise brushstrokes,
which instil in me no sense of awe
whatsoever, let alone the sea.
JONES
Preposterous! I do beg your
pardon, Mrs. Ruskin.
Mrs Ruskin nods.

91.
TURNER
Claude Lorrain was a genius.
Quite so.

JONES

RUSKIN
I sense an excess of modesty in
Mr. Turner, and there is no need
for such humility.
STANFIELD
Mr. Ruskin, sir: to conjecture upon
the matter of seascape painting is
one thing, but to stand amongst the
elements and to experience and to
interpret what one sees, that is
something quite other.
JONES
Hear, hear.
Quite.

ROBERTS

RUSKIN
Well, that is as it may be.
TURNER
Claude painted from the land,
looking at the sea becalmed by the
harbour.
RUSKIN
Oh, indeed.
RUSKIN'S MOTHER
‘Bless the Lord, oh my soul, who
layeth the beams of his chambers in
the waters and walketh upon the
wings of the wind.'
RUSKIN
How apt, Mother.
RUSKIN'S MOTHER
Thank you, John. When my son was
but a small boy, he was overheard
to remark that 'waves of sea are
indeed lovely to watch but they are
always ‘coming or gone, never in
any taken shape to be seen for a
second.'

92.
RUSKIN
(Joining in)
For a second.
(Laughs)
I find myself marvelling at my own
wealth of perception even at the
early age of four.
Quite so.

RUSKIN'S MOTHER

TURNER
Mr Ruskin, can I pose you a
somewhat conundrous question?
RUSKIN
Ah, please do, Mr. Turner.
He gets up and proceeds to the window, where he stands
expectantly.
TURNER
To which do you find yourself the
more partial, a steak and kidney
pie or a veal and ham pie?
The other artists laugh uproariously.
RUSKIN
I must confess, Mr. Turner, that I
find myself quite unable to answer
your question with the precision
that I would wish.
...

Somewhere in the countryside, a railway train races past a
fascinated Turner, the engine belching its steam high into
the sky.

...

In his studio, Turner is painting ‘Rain, Steam and Speed The Great Western Railway’. Hannah enters and gives him a
glass of sherry. Then she examines the painting for a few
moments. A little baffled, she looks at Turner, then leaves.

93.

...

At the Royal Academy, at the foot of the grand staircase, Sir
Martin Archer Shee, the President, bows to the young QUEEN
VICTORIA.
SHEE
Your Majesty.
The Queen and Shee ascend the stairs, followed by PRINCE
ALBERT and a SMALL ENTOURAGE. A few minutes later, they are
in the main gallery. The Queen and Prince Albert are
inspecting paintings.
She stops by one canvas.
QUEEN VICTORIA:
Terribly flat. Dull.
PRINCE ALBERT
It's rather dark, isn't it?
Hmm-mm.

QUEEN VICTORIA:

PRINCE ALBERT
Sir Martin.
Sir.

SHEE

PRINCE ALBERT
Who is the artist?
SHEE
I believe, sir, it's... er...

Shee turns to Callcott and Eastlake behind him.
EASTLAKE
Er, Mr. John Ferneley.
Shee turns back to Albert.
SHEE
MR. John Ferneley, sir.
PRINCE ALBERT
Ah, Mr. Ferneley.

Hmm.

Ah.

QUEEN VICTORIA:

Queen Victoria turns, spots a painting and reacts.

She stops by it.

She shakes her head.
Turner.

Albert joins her.

PRINCE ALBERT
He is clearly losing his eyesight
QUEEN VICTORIA
And this one is vile.
Victoria moves to the next Turner (’Sunrise with Sea
Monsters’).
PRINCE ALBERT
Ah, unglaublich.
QUEEN VICTORIA
Was ist das?
PRINCE ALBERT
Ich weiß' es nicht.
QUEEN VICTORIA
A dirty, yellow mess.
They move on, followed by their entourage. Turner is
revealed in an adjacent doorway, having overheard the Queen
and the Prince’s conversation. Horrified, he leaves.

...

In another gallery somewhere, two middle-aged GENTLEMEN ART
CRITICS are looking at Turner’s work.
CRITIC
It is a truly frightful piece.
Another CRITIC joins them.

CRITIC 2
It is indicative of mental disease.
CRITIC
It is wretched and abortive.
The Third critic bursts out laughing.
him.
Sad.

The others turn to

CRITIC 3

Now two LADY CRITICS are looking at Turner's work.
LADY CRITIC
Mr. Turner seems to have taken
leave of form altogether.
Hmm.

LADY CRITIC 2

LADY CRITIC
He has on former occasion chosen to
paint with cream or chocolate, yolk
of egg or currant jelly.
LADY CRITIC 2
(Laughing)
But here he uses his whole array of
kitchen stuff.
LADY CRITIC
Eggs and spinach.
LADY CRITIC 2
No. Soap suds and whitewash.
They both laugh.
...

In a popular theatre, to the raucous delight of the audience,
a music-hall sketch is being performed. A GROUP OF MEN AND
WOMEN stand looking in the window of an art dealers. A
BAKER’S BOY appears with a tray of jam tarts on his head.
BOY ACTOR
Jam tarts! Jam tarts!
Fresh jam tarts.
He goes over to the shop window. Much hubbub from the stage
crowd.

96.
Then the Baker’s Boy accidentally spills the tarts over the
painting on display, and runs off. The audience laughs.
Turner is standing at the back of the circle.

He laughs too.

An actor playing the Art Dealer enters (ACTOR 1).
ACTOR 1
Where is that wretched baker's boy?
ACTOR 2
His fate, I fear, he won't enjoy.
ACTRESS 1
He will indeed the lad destroy!
ACTOR 1
Aha! I have an inspiration.
ACTOR 3
What's that?
ACTOR 4
We're filled with fascination.
ACTRESS 2
What is he doing?
ACTOR 2
And why is he doing it?
Actor 1 is doing something to the ruined painting.
ACTRESS
Whatever he's brewing, we'll soon
be viewing it.

A masterpiece I here present,
which Mr. Turner has just sent.
The painting is now covered with broken jam tarts.

we have our doubts.
But who's this gent?
A fashionably dressed elderly actor enters.

OLD ACTOR
Ye common throng and hoi polloi,
I am a rich and cultured boy.
My wealth derives from tricking
knaves,
and selling coffee, tea and slaves.
My house is full of things of
beauty
- paintings, sculpture and other
booty.
I like to drink and gourmandise.
But what is this that greets my
eyes?
He has spotted the ruined painting, now covered with the jam
tarts.
ACTOR 1
It is the latest thing in Art.
ACTRESS 1
It looks like bits of old jam tart!
Turner watches, grim faced.
ACTOR 1
'Tis Mr. Turner's latest piece,
which, placed above your
mantelpiece OLD ACTOR
Oh, cease your costermonger sounds!
I'll buy it. Here's a thousand

He produces a wad of bank-notes with an elaborate gesture.
The audience boos.
ACTOR 1
Oh, sir. I thank you, in my humble
way.
OLD ACTOR
Don't grovel. Send it round today.
He exits.
ACTOR
I'll do so, sir, without delay.
Rejoice!
hooray!

Hurrah!

Hip, hip,

The Old Actor returns.
OLD ACTOR
Though ignorant of art and taste,
I'm filled with boundless glee,
for what's good enough for
Turner...
is good enough for me!
He exits, followed by all the other actors, except Actor 1,
who goes into his shop. The audience cheers and whistles and
claps. Turner leaves, much disturbed.
In the empty corridor of the theatre, a lone young usher
stands briefly as Turner passes him on his way out of the
theatre.
...

At a dinner party somewhere. Turner is sitting at a large
table, amongst many FELLOW DINERS. He is very drunk. A
BUTLER fills his glass, but Turner gestures to him to fill it
more. Then he eats a desert very sloppily.
Indistinct, overlapping snippets of conversation can be heard
from unseen and half-seen ladies and gentlemen. Some
characters we have met can be discerned - Captain Jones and
John Ruskin in particular.
Some snippets...
...design that my imagination could
suggest and he promised to write a
poem....
Very sage, Captain. Mr. Ruskin, I
fail to see wherein lies the
charity in misleading people as to
the amount of talents they possess.
Well, talent is something that lies
dormant and needs to be drawn out
in the right circumstances.
Yes, if one has the opportunity to
have it drawn out..

99.
My wife, Effie; er... I am still
waiting for her talents to arise
and be drawn out.
I’m sure that talents can be
crushed as much as they may be
drawn out.
Ah, precisely.
Perhaps it is the duty of the
husband to draw out any such
talent.
... Plutarch who said, 'Painting is
silent poetry...' Are you
interested in poetry at all?
A young woman (RUSKIN’S WIFE) sitting next to Turner now
smiles politely at him. He gestures to her.
TURNER
Sublime. Loneliness. Solitude.
'Ti... 'Tis not the same.
RUSKIN'S WIFE
Indeed not, Mr. Turner.
TURNER
It will come. Mrs. Ruskin, it will
come. Love.
They share a moment.
...

Early morning. Turner is asleep, fully clothed on his old bed
in his house. Hannah enters and puts down and cup of tea
beside him. Then she leans over him and looks at him. He
snores and turns onto his back. She opens the curtains.
Turner wakes up.
TURNER
Oh... What is the hour?
HANNAH
Five-and-twenty to seven.

100.
Turner mutters, sits up, and moves to the foot of the bed
with great effort. Hannah brings him his tea.
Thank you.

TURNER

HANNAH
The sun's up, in all its glory.
TURNER
I must get on.
He takes a sip of tea, and gives her the cup and saucer.
Then he puts on his shoes. Hannah lingers. He stands and
starts putting on his coat. Hannah puts down the teacup and
helps him on with his coat.
HANNAH
Don't you want your breakfast?
TURNER
No, thank you kindly. Are you
faring well?
HANNAH
Yes. Thank you. And yourself?
Turner puts on his hat.
Hmm.

TURNER
Yes, yes.

He picks up his bag.
HANNAH
Will I be seeing you tonight?
Unlikely.
Tomorrow?
No.

TURNER
HANNAH
TURNER

HANNAH
Oh. I might as well stop changing
the bed sheets in here.
Pause.
Hmm.

TURNER

101.
Turner leaves the room.

Hannah sits on the bed, forlorn.
...

Outside Turner and Mrs Booth’s new house in Chelsea. Lots of
people pass to and fro. Some distance from the house, Turner
sits sketching on a jetty. Mrs Booth comes out of the house
with a broom. She calls to Turner.
Mr. Booth!

MRS BOOTH

Turner turns. They wave at each other. She goes indoors.
Turner picks up a piece of bark, stands stiffly and walks
towards the house.
Mrs Booth comes out again.

She nods to a PASSING WOMAN.

MRS BOOTH
Good day to you.
Then, as Turner nears, she goes back into the house.

MRS BOOTH
Oh, what d'you have there?
TURNER

Ooh. Hmm.

Hmm.

MRS BOOTH

She takes the bark and puts it down.
with his coat.
Sticky.

Then she helps him off

TURNER
Horrid parched.

They go through to the kitchen, where Turner sits at the
table. Mrs Booth pours him a drink.

...

A busy London street. A sign announces that the shop that
Turner now enters is a Daguerreotype Institution. He
examines the shop window, and enters.
Inside, he is greeted by a young, fresh-faced man, CORNELIUS.
CORNELIUS
Good morning, sir.
TURNER
A very good day to you, sir.
CORNELIUS
Nice day, sir.
Hmm-mm.

TURNER

Turner looks at small daguerreotype portraits on the wall.
The photographer, MAYALL, enters.
MAYALL
Ah! Good morning, sir.
Greetings and welcome.
TURNER
A hearty good morning to you, sir.
MAYALL
Now, you would be Mr...
Mr. Booth.

CORNELIUS

103.
MAYALL
Ah, Booth, yes. Mr. Booth.
(laughs)
TURNER
At the appointed hour, I believe?
MAYALL
Indeed, sir. Mayall. John Mayall.
TURNER
I had made that assumption, sir.
MAYALL
(laughing)
At your service, Mr. Booth. Now, if
you would be so kind as to make
yourself comfortable...
TURNER
This is the contraption?
MAYALL
Indeed, sir. That is what we call
the camera.
TURNER
The camera?
Yes, sir.

MAYALL

TURNER
Not the cam-er-a.
MAYALL
Er... No, sir. The camera.
TURNER
The camera?
Yes, sir.

MAYALL

TURNER
As in ‘camera obscura?’
MAYALL
Ah, precisely, sir. The camera.
Now, if I may ask you to take a
seat please, here...
TURNER
Name of manufacturer?

104.
MAYALL
Er, it comes to us from the United
States, sir.
TURNER
The name eludes you?
MAYALL
Er, no, sir...
TURNER
My name eludes me from time to
time.
MAYALL
(laughing)
Indeed, sir? Now...
Turner hesitates, then climbs a few steps to a raised
platform.
TURNER:
I denote from your brogue that you
hail from the Americas.
MAYALL
From the fine city of
Philadelphia, sir.
TURNER
Philadelphia. 'Tis on the eastern
coast, is it not?
MAYALL
That is correct, sir.
TURNER
(sitting)
Ow! You shall have to forgive the
whip crack of my knees.
(Mayall laughs)
Hat on or hat off?
MAYALL
Er, may I ask your profession, sir?
TURNER
Er... Master of Chancery.
MAYALL
Oh. A man of the law.
Indeed.

TURNER

105.
MAYALL
Then I should recommend the hat on,
sir.
Hmm.

TURNER

MAYALL
Now, if I might deploy this
device...
He proceeds to place Turner’s neck into a steadying clamp.
TURNER
Hey! What is this heinous
implement?
MAYALL
Merely a gentle holding brace, sir.
TURNER
Puts me in mind of a surgical
instrument. Does it hurt?
MAYALL
Not in the slightest, I assure you.
So if I may...
Hmm.

TURNER

Mayall adjusts the brace.
MAYALL
Not too uncomfortable for you, Mr.
Booth?
Hmm.

TURNER

MAYALL
Thank you, sir.
TURNER
What is the significance of the
looking-glass?
A mirror on a stand is beside Turner.

Mayall adjusts it.

MAYALL
It is to illuminate your good self,
sir.
Light from the mirror falls on Turner’s face.

106.
TURNER
As the sun upon a lake.
MAYALL
Most droll, Mr Booth. Most droll.
He laughs and starts humming.
TURNER
What is concealed behind the small
brass cap? An optic?
MAYALL
Oh, yes, sir, a glass lens.
Mayall opens the cap, revealing the lens.
TURNER
As a telescope?
MAYALL
Not unlike a telescope, sir.
you, Cornelius.

Thank

He takes a large drape from Cornelius.
TURNER
It is prismatic?
MAYALL
I fear not, sir. It is an
achromatic lens.
TURNER
Achromatic.
MAYALL
Now, let me peruse you.
Mayall puts the drape over his head.
TURNER
Why are you shrouded in the manner
of a condemned monk?
MAYALL
I am simply shutting out the light,
Mr. Booth. Ah, splendid, sir.
TURNER
The image you create is not of
colour. For why?

107.
MAYALL
I am afraid that is a question we
have yet to answer, sir. It is a
mystery. Thank you, Cornelius.
He has taken off the drape, and has positioned himself behind
the camera. Cornelius inserts the plate.
TURNER
And long may it remain so.
MAYALL
Now, if I may ask you to focus your
gaze here on the flowers and we are
almost ready. Thank you,
Cornelius.
(hums)
Now, I will require your absolute
stillness for the next ten seconds.
Turner holds the pose.
MAYALL
And we begin.
He takes off the lens cap, looks at his pocket watch, and for
ten seconds hums the tune of the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves from
Verdi’s ‘Nabucco’.
MAYALL
(laughing)
And there we have it.
'Tis done?

TURNER

MAYALL
It is finished, sir.
TURNER
I fear that I too am finished.
MAYALL
Oh, come, come, sir.
He laughs.
Hmm.

TURNER

...

In the Chelsea house, Mrs Booth examines the now mounted
daguerreotype portrait of Turner.
MRS BOOTH
This be one of them there

Hmm.

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
The Queen had one of these taken
with Prince Albert.
TURNER
Did she so?
She did.
Hmm.

MRS BOOTH
TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Oh, you do look most handsome.
TURNER
Hmm. 'Tis known as a
daguerreotype.
MRS BOOTH
Oh. Whatever next? Where'd you
have this done, then?
TURNER
Up in town, on the Strand. Fellow
with a box.
He adopts an exaggerated parody of his pose.

TURNER
We're going there.
Where?

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
Have our likeness taken.
When?

MRS BOOTH

They both

109.

Thursday.
Oh.

TURNER
MRS BOOTH

TURNER
I've arranged an appointment.
MRS BOOTH
Well, you'll have to cancel it.
TURNER
'Tis painless.
MRS BOOTH
Well, I care not. You don't want my
old face in one of these.
TURNER
I do. The two of us together.
Forever.
MRS BOOTH
I... I do thank you for this. But I
ain't going.

...

In Mayall’s shop, Turner and Mrs Booth are sitting side by
side, posing for the camera. Mrs Booth is petrified.
Throughout the scene, we look only at Turner and Mrs Booth.
TURNER
'Tis the camera. Mr. Mayall, may I
beg your indulgence with a
question?
MAYALL
Why, certainly, sir.
TURNER
Do you take landscapes with your
contraption?
MAYALL
I do, sir, from time to time.
TURNER
Hmm. Such as what?

110.
MAYALL
Why, I have recorded the great
falls of Niagara, sir.
TURNER
The Niagara Falls?
MAYALL
Indeed, sir.
TURNER
The greatest wonder in nature.
MAYALL
It was there that I was once able
to capture a rainbow. Hmm.
TURNER
I'm green-eyed with envy. The
Niagara Falls is a natural
phenomenon that I have long desired
to witness.
MAYALL
Is that so, sir?
(to both)
Now, madam, sir, if I may ask you
to fix your gaze here upon these
beautiful flowers. Thank you,
Cornelius.
TURNER
The Niagara Falls. Soon painters
will go about the world, with a
box, like a tinker, instead of a
portfolio under their arms.
MAYALL
Well, I'm... I'm sure they will,
sir. I'm sure they will.
Hmm.

TURNER
(growls) (exhales)

MAYALL
Now, if you are comfortable, madam,
sir, we may proceed.
They hold their poses.

Mrs Booth is terrified.

...

111.

In Turner’s gallery, which is now very untidy. Strewn about
the floor are buckets and bowls to catch drips. A large,
wealthy-looking, middle-aged, WELL-DRESSED GENTLEMAN is
inspecting paintings.
Hannah appears with a glass of sherry, which she gives him.
GILLOTT
Thank you, miss.
HANNAH
Thank you, sir.
She gives a drink to Turner, who is standing nearby.
Hmm.

TURNER

GILLOTT
Your good health, sir.
TURNER
And yours, Mr. Gillott.
They chink glasses and drink.
Turner.
Sir.

GILLOTT
TURNER

GILLOTT
I have a proposition to make.
Ah.

TURNER

GILLOTT
I like your pictures.
TURNER
Well, thank you, sir.
GILLOTT
My wife is especially partial to
your companion pieces that grace
our drawing room.
TURNER
Please convey my felicitations to
your dear lady.

112.
GILLOTT
I will, thank you.
He puts down his glass.
GILLOTT
And now I wish to show you one of
my pictures.
TURNER
Oh, indeed, sir? I am much
intrigued.
Gillott takes out a wad of money, and holds up a banknote.
TURNER
Five-pound note. Exceeding pretty.
GILLOTT
Quite so. For all of your
paintings, I will give you twenty
thousand of these. One hundred
thousand pounds. All your oils,
your watercolours, your drawings,
your sketchbooks, everything you've
ever produced. One hundred thousand
pounds. What do you say?
Hmm.

TURNER

GILLOTT
Turner, I am a man of wealth, a
self-made man. Throughout the
world, three quarters of everything
that is written is written with a
Gillott pen nib, one of my nibs.
I enjoy my wealth. Two things
delight me in my life: fashioning a
nib from steel, and making money,
and I like to spend my money on
things that give me pleasure. And
your pictures give me much
pleasure. I want them, all of them.
TURNER
Sir... with a modicum of regret
and somewhat of a heavy heart, I'm
sorry to say 'tis out of the
question.
How so?

GILLOTT

113.
TURNER
They are bequeathed.
GILLOTT
Bequeathed? To whom?
TURNER
To the British nation, sir.
GILLOTT
And what will the British nation
pay you?
Nothing.

TURNER

GILLOTT
Nothing? Turner, I am offering you
a price you will never see again.
TURNER
Indeed, sir, by which I am much
humbled.
GILLOTT
Then accept my offer.
TURNER
I cannot, sir. I wish to see my
work, displayed in one place, all
together, viewed by the public gratis.
GILLOTT
Turner, this is perverse.
TURNER
Hmm. So be it.
GILLOTT
You cannot give your pictures away.
They're too valuable.
Hmm.

TURNER

GILLOTT
Oh, don't be a fool, man. See
sense.
Turner chuckles. Pause.
GILLOTT
I wish you good day, sir.

114.
TURNER
I wish you good day, sir. Me
damsel, would you kindly show the
gentleman out?
She does so. Turner drinks his sherry.

She

Downstairs in his new studio, Turner, with some difficulty,
is trying to put a canvas on the easel.
Upstairs, Mrs Booth continues to make the bed.
MRS BOOTH
(sings)
... rouse about...
She hears Turner shouting downstairs; then she hears him
fall. She hurries out, and rushes down the stairs to find
Turner lying on the studio floor, struggling with the canvas.
Oh, there!

MRS BOOTH
Oh... oh, there.

She takes the canvas from Turner.
MRS BOOTH
Stay there. Stay there. Don't move.
Don't... Don't move.
TURNER
I... slipped.
Mrs Booth crouches by Turner.
MRS BOOTH
Oh, Lord. Oh, dear. All right.
TURNER
(breathing heavily and
clearing his throat)
It's passing.

115.
MRS BOOTH
Here, stay there. Stay there. Oh,
my dear. Oh, there.
TURNER
No... It's passed. It's passed.
I've got to get on.
MRS BOOTH
Here. Here. Oh, no, no, no. Sit ye
down. Sit ye down.
She helps him up.
TURNER
Got to get... No, no, no, no. Got
to get on... Got to get on.
MRS BOOTH
No... No, you must sit down and
rest now.
Mrs Booth adjusts the easel.
TURNER
The canvas. The canvas is damaged.
MRS BOOTH
Oh, that's all right.
Sit down. Sit ye down. There.
Turner picks up the canvas.
TURNER
Now, bustle about. Bustle about...
MRS BOOTH
Oh, there... There be no helping
you!
She storms out.

...

In their Chelsea house, Turner and Mrs Booth are in Turner’s
studio. He is painting ‘Norham Castle, Sunrise’, whilst she
is washing out his paintbrushes. Suddenly, Turner recites
one of his own poems. He turns and performs it to Mrs Booth,
pointing his brush at her.

116.
TURNER
Be still, my dear Molly,
Dear Molly, be still.
No more urge that soft sigh to thy
will.
It is anxious each wish to fulfil,
But I prithee, dear Molly, be
still.
He points his brush at her.
brushes.

Amused, she continues cleaning

TURNER
By thy lips’ quivering motion I
ween
She laughs.

Turner advances towards her.

TURNER
To the centre of... where love lies
between.
She laughs.
TURNER
A passport to bliss is thy will,
Yet I prithee, dear Molly, be still
MRS BOOTH
(laughing, joining in)
Dear Molly, be still.
TURNER
By thy eyes when half-closed with
delight,
Yet so languishing turn from the
light.
With my kisses I'll hide 'em, I
will......
Yet prithee, dear Molly, be still.
MRS BOOTH
(joining in)
Yet prithee, dear Molly, be still.
TURNER
By thy bosom so throbbing with
truth
Its short heavings to me speak
reproof
By the half-blushing mark on each
hill
Oh, my Molly, dear Molly, be still.

117.
Mrs Booth continues to giggle and laugh. Turner fondles her
breasts, from behind her. They both laugh.
He nestles his chin on her shoulder. Then his attention is
caught by his painting, and he returns to it. Mrs Booth
watches him, shakes her head and resumes cleaning his
brushes.

...

At the Royal Academy. Varnishing Day again, but many years
later. Turner examines three Pre-Raphaelite paintings, which
are hanging together.
They are ‘The Woodman’s Daughter’ by John Everett Millais,
‘Mariana’, also by Millais, and ‘Chaucer at the Court of
Edward III’, by Ford Maddox Brown.
Turner is highly amused by these offerings, and chortles
until he coughs.
...

In Turner’s London house, which has now become extremely
cluttered and untidy. Turner enters the hall, muttering to
himself. He takes off his coat, and throws it on a table.
Then he goes into his studio and picks up a canvas. He
returns to the hall, puts down the canvas, then takes another
coat from the coat-stand, puts it on, along with his hat, and
picks up the canvas and his umbrella.

...

A busy day - people, horses, hustle and bustle. Turner,
carrying the canvas, approaches his house. A WOMAN NEXT DOOR
is selling drinks to two boys from a stall. Turner arrives
at his house. He hesitates for a moment.
Mrs Booth is in the kitchen, polishing the silver at the
table. Turner enters with the canvas.
There.

MRS BOOTH

118.
Alarmed, she gets up.
MRS BOOTH
What ails thee?
Hmm!

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Let me take your hat.
Hmm.

TURNER

She takes his hat.
There.

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
My sketchbook.
Ooh.

MRS BOOTH

Turner searches his pocket.
TURNER
It's not there.
MRS BOOTH
'Tis in your other pocket then?
He searches in another pocket.
TURNER
Hmm... No, it's not.
MRS BOOTH
Don't ye worry about it now. 'Twill
be somewhere.
She helps him off with his coat.
MRS BOOTH
We can look for it later.
TURNER
Where is the canvas?
MRS BOOTH
'Tis behind you, dear, on the
chair.

119.
TURNER
Hmm? Hmm...
(laughs)
He picks up the canvas.
MRS BOOTH
You want I should take it upstairs?
What?

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
Your canvas.
TURNER
No. No, no, no, no....
He wanders off.
MRS BOOTH
I'll get you a drink.
Turner sits by the fire. He sighs.
There.

MRS BOOTH

She brings him a drink.
puts it down.

She takes the canvas from him and

MRS BOOTH
So... where have you been today?
She turns a chair towards him and sits down.
TURNER
Hmm... Hmm?
MRS BOOTH
Did you go back to Hyde Park?
TURNER
Hmm... Yeh, yeh...
MRS BOOTH
How be it all progressing?
TURNER
It's an engineering phenomenon.
Crystal pane upon crystal pane,
reaching up beyond the clouds.

120.
MRS BOOTH
'Twill be a marvel to behold.
TURNER
It's a glass cathedral. It's the
one... (GASPS) (CHOKES)
He suddenly gasps, and appears to choke.
Oh, here.

MRS BOOTH

She takes his drink and loosens his necktie.

He struggles to

MRS BOOTH
Oh, there. Shh, shh...
...

Turner’s house. Hannah arrives at the table on which Turner
has thrown his coat. One of her cats is sitting on it.
HANNAH
So bad. Look at your messings.
Naughty pussy.
She shakes the cat off the coat.

The cat has soiled it.

HANNAH
I don't know.
She feels something in the pocket. She takes it out. It’s
an envelope, out of which she slides a letter. Then she
looks at the envelope more closely. It is addressed to
Turner at his Chelsea address. She ponders this for a while.

...

Chelsea. Turner is in bed.
approaches with Dr Price.

He is very ill.

MRS BOOTH
Now, dear, here be good Doctor
Price for ye. He has come all the
way from Margate.

Mrs Booth

121.

Dr. Price.

TURNER

DR PRICE
Good morning, Turner.
MRS BOOTH
If there be anything you do need,
Doctor...
DR PRICE
Thank you, Mrs. Booth.
MRS BOOTH
I shall be downstairs.
She goes downstairs.
DR PRICE
Now, my dear Turner, how are you
feeling?
TURNER
Somewhat weakened, sir.
Dr Price takes his pulse.
DR PRICE
I'm so sorry. We all miss you in
Margate.
TURNER
Ah, Margate.
DR PRICE
Are you in pain?
TURNER
(touching his chest)
Here.
DR PRICE
Shortness of breath?
Yes.

TURNER

DR PRICE
Now, then...
He examines Turner’s eyes.

122.
TURNER
Did you come up on the railway?
DR PRICE
I did, and the truth is, I can
never travel by train without
recalling your miraculous painting.
Turner sighs.
sighs again.

Dr Price sits on the bed.

Pause.

The doctor

DR PRICE
My dear Turner, I am obliged to
inform you that your condition is
grave. Your days are numbered, and
if you have affairs to attend to in
this world you should do so now and
prepare yourself for the next.
TURNER
Dr Price, with the utmost respect,
may I suggest you take yourself
downstairs to Mrs. Booth, avail
yourself of a large glass of
sherry, come back up here and
reassess your opinion.
DR PRICE
No, sir, I'm afraid I shan't be
doing that.
TURNER
So I'm to become a nonentity.
DR PRICE
I do not understand exactly what
you mean by a nonentity.
Turner chuckles.

Then his smile fades.

...

At the front door, Dr Price is leaving.
MRS BOOTH
Good day to you, Doctor.
DR PRICE
Good day, Mrs. Booth. Thank you.

123.
She gives him his hat.
MRS BOOTH
I shall send out for the laudanum
directly.
DR PRICE
Splendid. He couldn't be in better
hands.
MRS BOOTH
I do my best. So, will you be
taking the boat back from Chelsea
Pier there?
DR PRICE
Indeed, I shall catch the midday
train from Charing Cross.
MRS BOOTH
Well, I do wish'ee a safe journey,
and I thank you, Doctor.
DR PRICE
I shall return shortly.
Dr Price puts on his hat and walks off.
the scene, then goes in.

Mrs Booth surveys

As Dr Price moves away, he passes two women, one of whom has
her face largely covered by a cloth. We soon see that this
is Hannah. She is with a YOUNGER WOMAN COMPANION. Outside
the house next door to Turner’s, the neighbour (the seller of
drinks) and ANOTHER WOMAN watch Hannah and her friend as they
pass.
Arriving at Turner’s and Mrs Booth’s house, they stop.
Hannah has the envelope with her.
HANNAH
Number six.
She looks up at the house for a moment.
HANNAH
I need a rest.
Pardon?

HANNAH'S FRIEND

HANNAH
I need a rest.

Then she turns away.

124.
She moves away from the house, past the two Neighbours.
NEIGHBOUR
Can we help, my dear?
HANNAH
I'm looking for an old gentleman.
NEIGHBOUR
An old gentleman? Do you have a
name?
NEIGHBOUR 2
There's a lot of old gentlemen
round here.
HANNAH
He lives next door.
HANNAH'S FRIEND
Number six.
NEIGHBOUR
There is an old gentleman lives
next door with his good lady wife.
They say he has the sickness. Are
you a relative?
HANNAH
N... No matter.
She starts to leave.
Good day.

HANNAH'S FRIEND

She follows Hannah.
Good day.
Good day.

NEIGHBOUR
NEIGHBOUR 2

The two women exchange looks.

...

125.
Turner is in bed. He is staring, feverish, hallucinating.
Mrs Booth comforts him.
MRS BOOTH
Shh... shh, shh, shh, shh.
Turner pushes her off.
TURNER
(frightened)
Aaah!
MRS BOOTH
No, no, no. 'Tis I. There. Shh,
shh.’
She comforts him again.
...

Another day. Mrs Booth is looking out of the bedroom window.
Turner is in bed.
MRS BOOTH
Poor, wretched soul.
Turner throws back the covers.
MRS BOOTH
She be drowned dead.
Hmm.

TURNER

MRS BOOTH
There. The suffering she must have
seen. Hmm.
Turner gets out of bed and joins her at the window.
MRS BOOTH
If there be a God, he be a cruel
one.
Turner picks up a sketch book which is beside her.
MRS BOOTH
What are you doing?
TURNER
I have to sketch her.

126.
He leaves the room.
MRS BOOTH
Get back into bed now, Joseph
Mallord William Turner!
He proceeds down the stairs.
MRS BOOTH
No, no, no, no, no, no. There be no
shoes on your feet!
She follows him.
...

Outside, a young woman lies on the river bank. She is dead drowned. A POLICEMAN scuttles about. ANOTHER POLICEMAN
crouches by the corpse. Turner arrives on the jetty, whilst
Mrs Booth tries to put his coat around his shoulders. He
starts to sketch the body, but he is weak. He mutters to
himself. Mrs Booth tries to pull him away. He tries to
resist. He is in pain.
MRS BOOTH
Oh, there. Let me take you in.
Turner mutters.
MRS BOOTH
There. No. Come in. You can finish
that later.
She helps him back towards the house.
gathered round. They watch him go.

Neighbours have

Turner is in bed, asleep. Mrs Booth sits at his bedside,
looking towards the window. Dr Price sits on the other side
of the bed.
Silence.
Turner surfaces a little.
him.

He groans.

Mrs Booth turns to

127.
TURNER
Me damsel.....
Mrs Booth smiles warmly at him.
TURNER
(clearly)
The Sun is God!
He laughs...

And then he dies.

Dr Price gets up, and checks Turner’s pulse. Mrs Booth
buries her head in Turner’s arm. The doctor gently closes
Turner’s eyes.
Silence.

In the distance, the sound of a flock of geese.

Long pause.

...

Now, in silence, we see Turner sketching, silhouetted against
an enormous setting sun.
...

Some time later. Mrs Booth is cleaning the window of her
front door. She polishes vigorously for a while. Then she
stops and reflects. Warm, tender memories, tinged with
humour and sadness. She resumes her task.
...

And now, in Turner’s old house, Hannah is ill and frail. She
emerges from the gallery, muttering. Slowly, she shuffles
into Turner’s studio. She is weeping. A sad, lost soul.

SLOW FADE TO BLACKOUT.

...

128.
NOTE
Hannah’s skin disease (psoriasis), which is marginally
evident in the early part of the film, gradually deteriorates
over the years. By the end, it is palpably severe.
