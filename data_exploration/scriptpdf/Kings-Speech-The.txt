CARD:
1925
King George V reigns over a quarter of the world’s
population.
He asks his second son, the Duke of York, to give the closing
speech at the Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London.
INT. BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE, STUDIO - DAY
CLOSE ON a BBC microphone of the 1920's,

A formidable piece

A BBC NEWS READER, in a tuxedo with carnation boutonniere, is
gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a
towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo expectorates
discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and
signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The
Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays
his inner throat. Now, he’s ready.
The reader speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones.

BBC NEWS READER
Good afternoon. This is the BBC
National Programme and Empire
Services taking you to Wembley
Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of
the Second and Final Season of the
Empire Exhibition.

BBC NEWS READER (V.O.)
58 British Colonies and Dominions
have taken part, making this the
largest Exhibition staged anywhere
in the world. Complete with the new
stadium, the Exhibition was built
in Wembley, Middlesex at a cost of
over 12 million pounds. The
Exhibition has attracted over 27
million visitors from every corner
of our great Empire and the rest of
the world.

INT. CONTROL ROOM, BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE - DAY
Technicians in suits, ties and scientific looking overcoats,
wearing bulky headphones, monitor daunting banks of valves
and dials while the Reader continues:
BBC NEWS READER (V.O.)
Today the vast Stadium is filled to
capacity with in excess of 100,000
spectators...as regiments from His
Majesty's Army, Navy and Air Force
stand in review.
INT. GREEN ROOM - DAY
Nervous eyes flick towards a tunnel leading to a bright
light.
CLOSE ON - BERTIE - the Duke of York, second son of the King;
his handsome, sensitive, features look terrified.
BBC NEWS READER (V.O.)
The Opening Ceremony was the first
occasion his Majesty the King
addressed his subjects on the
wireless. The close of the first
Season was the initial time His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
had broadcast. And today His Royal
Highness the Duke of York will give
his inaugural broadcast to the
Nation and the World.
WIDEN TO REVEAL his young wife, truly an English rose.
ELIZABETH
Time to go.
He stares straight ahead, frozen. She gives him a loving
peck on the cheek, quickly rubbing off a fleck of lipstick.
BBC NEWS READER (V.O.)
Leading us in prayer will be the
Right Honourable and Most Reverend
Archbishop of York, Primate of all
England and Metropolitan. Now we go
live to Wembley Stadium, where His
Royal Highness the Duke of York
will read his message from the
King.
COSMO LANG - comes up to Bertie. Tries to be helpful but
makes him more nervous.
COSMO LANG
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.

The last bars of “God Save The King” echo down the corridor.
ROBERT WOOD, the Chief BBC Engineer on Location whispers:
WOOD
Let the microphone do the work,
sir.
Wood checks his watch.
WOOD (CONT’D)
Thirty seconds, sir.
Bertie braces his shoulders manfully, but without an ounce of
confidence, closes his eyes, nods, opens them, and
reluctantly goes through the tunnel towards the light, like a
prize-fighter entering the arena, to be greeted by the roar
of the crowd.
EXT.

ROYAL PODIUM - DAY

HAND-HELD CAMERA, BERTIE’S POV: far ahead, at a seemingly
impossible distance, is the huge intimidating microphone, the
only thing between the terrified observer and 100,000 people.
Silence falls over the stadium.
Overhead, thick roiling clouds.
BERTIE approaches...like a death march.
Bertie’s eyes widen in terror as he reaches the microphone.
The red transmission light blinks four times then glows solid
red. Bertie is live.
INT. CONTROL ROOM, BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE - DAY
Technicians stare at dials and listen to the hiss of silence.
The Reader and Floor Manager glance at each other nervously.

In the tense silence PAN THROUGH some of the crowd waiting
with growing discomfort. In particular we notice a father

Bertie is frozen at the microphone. His neck and jaw muscles
contract and quiver.

The stammer careens back at him, amplified and distorted by
the stadium PA system.

Bertie gulps for air like a beached fish and attempts to

He can’t get the word out. SPLAT...the first drops of rain

Hyde Park Corner. In the foreground people pay their respects
at the WWI monument with fresh wreaths.
A Rover sedan - definitive doctor’s car of the era - arrives.
A FOOTMAN scurries down the steps to meet it as the STEWARD
opens the front door.
INT. DRAWING ROOM, 145 PICCADILLY - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE ON SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM - an elderly, unctuous,
studiedly-distinguished physician who simultaneously manages
to combine pontificating and obsequiousness.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
Inhale deep into your lungs.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Bertie is seated nervously on the edge of a couch, gripping a
cigarette between thumb and forefinger, placed in the middle
of his mouth.
Elizabeth watches from across the room.

5
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves
and gives you confidence.
Bertie clearly feels nothing of the sort. Smiling
ingratiatingly, the doctor produces a medical cannister from
his bag.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
If Your Highness will be so kind as
to open his hand...
Bertie unclenches a fist.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
Thank you so very much.
Opening the container, with forceps he removes five marbles
from an antiseptic solution and places them onto Bertie’s
palm.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
Sterilized. Now...if I may take the
liberty?...insert them into your
mouth.
Bertie obeys, mortified.

ELIZABETH
Excuse me, Doctor. What is the
purpose of this?
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
The classic approach that cured
Demosthenes.
ELIZABETH
That was in Ancient Greece. Has it
worked since?
Blandine-Bentham passes Bertie a book.

6
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
Now if you would be so kind as to
read. A wealth of words.
Bertie tries. It is excruciating.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
Fight against those marbles Your
Royal Highness. Enunciate!
As Bertie struggles.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT’D)
A little more concentration your
Royal Higness.
Bertie spits the marbles out.
BERTIE
(explodes)
I nearly swallowed the damned
things!
Bertie storms out as Elizabeth tries to placate the doctor.
ELIZABETH
Thank you so much, Doctor, it’s
been most interesting.
Elizabeth goes through to the adjoining room to find Bertie.
INT.

BERTIE’S STUDY, 145 PICCADILLY - CONTINUOUS

Bertie is struggling to light a cigarette.
ELIZABETH
Temper, Bertie darling, temper.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
BERTIE
Insert marbles! He can insert his
own bloody marbles....!
[Note: when he speaks with his wife there’s hardly any
hesitation]
Elizabeth smiles as she lights the cigarette for him.
ELIZABETH
You can’t keep doing this, Bertie.
BERTIE
I know. Promise me: no more.

EXT.

HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY

A thick grey wet blanket...
Out of which materializes the moisture splattered hood of a
large AUSTIN.
Elizabeth, inside, determinedly glances out.
The vehicle noses thru a pea-soup fog. The York’s HOUSE
DETECTIVE is walking a few feet in front of the car, finding
the way.
After a moment, the House Detective signals the driver to
stop. Elizabeth peers out the window.
POV - in the gloom the least attractive and most illmaintained of the Georgian terraced houses.
Elizabeth looks disappointed and dubious. She gets out of the
car. Instructing the House Detective to wait outside, she
enters the building.
INT. GROUND FLOOR ENTRANCE, HARLEY STREET - CONTINUOUS
Elizabeth enters, somewhat dampened, the white silk roses
decorating her hat now limp.
There is a cramped elevator which is whirring noisily and a
winding staircase.
Elizabeth is even more dubious.
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Elizabeth inside the cramped elevator.
She surveys the buttons. The bottom one reads “Basement: L.
Logue, Speech Defects”.
She closes the inner gate of the elevator and presses the
bottom button.
Nothing.
Confused, she opens the inner gate, closes the outer gate
then the inner gate and presses the button again. The
elevator jumps downwards.
INT. WAITING ROOM, LOGUE’S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that’s all.
She looks about. The area is devoid of life. Coughs. No
response. Calls imperiously:

8
ELIZABETH
Hello. Is anyone there?
From behind a door:
MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
I’m just in the loo.
Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She’s
further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being
flushed, and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE - a
tall, middle-aged man with strong features. His demeanor is
friendly, yet professional.
LIONEL
“Poor and content is rich and rich
enough”
ELIZABETH
I beg your pardon?
LIONEL
Shakespeare. I’m sorry, there’s no
receptionist. I like to keep things
simple. How are you Mrs Johnson?
I’m afraid you’re late.
Offers his hand.

She takes it, a little gingerly.

ELIZABETH
I’m afraid I am.
LIONEL
Where’s Mr Johnson?
ELIZABETH
He doesn’t know I’m here.
LIONEL
That’s not a promising start.
ELIZABETH
My husband has seen everyone to no
avail. He’s given up hope.
LIONEL
He hasn’t seen me.
ELIZABETH
You’re awfully sure of yourself.
LIONEL
I’m sure of anyone who wants to be
cured.

9
ELIZABETH
Naturally he wishes to be cured. My
husband is required to speak
publicly.
LIONEL
Perhaps he should change jobs.
He can’t.

ELIZABETH

LIONEL
Indentured servitude?
ELIZABETH
Something of that nature.
LIONEL
Well have your hubby pop
by...Tuesday would be good...to
give his personal history and I’ll
make a frank appraisal.
ELIZABETH
I do not have a “hubby”. We don’t
‘pop’. We never talk about our
private lives. You must come to us.
LIONEL
Sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my
rules.
ELIZABETH
And what if my husband were the
Duke of York?
LIONEL
The Duke of York?
ELIZABETH
Yes the Duke of York.
LIONEL
I thought the appointment was for
“Johnson”? Forgive me, your
Royal...?
Highness.

ELIZABETH

LIONEL
Your Royal Highness.
ELIZABETH
Johnson was used during the Great
War when the Navy didn’t want the
enemy to know ‘he’ was aboard.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
We are operating under the
strictest of confidences.
LIONEL
Of course. I’m considered the
enemy?
ELIZABETH
You will be if you remain unobliging.
LIONEL
How did you find me?
ELIZABETH
The President of the Speech
Therapists Society.
LIONEL
Eileen McCleod? She’s a sport.
ELIZABETH
Dr McCleod warned me your
antipodean methods were “unorthodox
and controversial”. I warned
her...they were not my favorite
words.
I succeed.

LIONEL

ELIZABETH
So she says.
LIONEL
I can cure your husband. But for my
method to work there must be trust
and total equality in the safety of
my consultation room. No
exceptions.
ELIZABETH
Well then, in that case...
Pause.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
When can you start?
EXT.

SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

A well-used Morris Oxford pulls up, driven by Lionel’s eldest
son - LAURIE. Lionel is the passenger. As he gets out:
LIONEL
Still sounds a bit rough.

11
LAURIE
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
LIONEL
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
LAURIE
Yes, I’ve hardly been out of the
car all day.
They enter a modest dwelling.
INT. DINING AREA OF LIVING-ROOM, LOGUE FLAT

- EVENING

Lionel and MYRTLE are finishing up at the table with their
three sons. As well as Laurie and ANTONY, there’s their
studious middle son VALENTINE, 17, his nose buried in a stack
of science books.
Lionel is bursting to tell Myrtle something.
LIONEL
I had a special visitor today.
ANTONY
May I be excused?
MYRTLE
(to Lionel)
Oh yes?
LIONEL
You must stay, bored stupid,
listening to your parents’ inane
conversation.
ANTONY
(grinning)
Thanks, dad!
And mum.
And mum!

LIONEL
ANTONY

MYRTLE
How special is special?
Me too?
A girl?
What else?

LAURIE
LIONEL
LAURIE

12
He and Antony start to leave.
MYRTLE
Take your plates.
LIONEL
Special to the point of someone I
can’t really talk about.
The boys grabs their plates and exit. Lionel looks at
Valentine, nose still buried in his text.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Doctor? Doctor? You can go as well.
VALENTINE
(still studying)
I’m fine.
Lionel clears Valentine’s plate. Valentine goes back to his
book and scientific oblivion.
MYRTLE
Not too high and mighty I hope?
Aah.

LIONEL

Antony burst back in, model airplane in hand, doing barrel
rolls with sound effects, bombing Valentine with a tea towel.
MYRTLE
Not someone who’d...call attention?
Why bring it up if you can’t talk
about it?
Silence.
LIONEL
Myrtle, just a woman looking to
help her husband.
They realize from engine noises that Antony is under the
table.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
(trying to make light of
it, not quite succeeding)
And I had a ‘call’.
Oh yes.

MYRTLE

Valentine looks up from his book.
VALENTINE
What’s the Illiotibial Tract, Dad?

13
LIONEL
If you don’t know, look it up.
Right.

VALENTINE

Starts turning pages.
LIONEL
Could be fun.
MYRTLE
It always is.
LIONEL
They’re a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
MYRTLE
I’m sure you’ll be splendid.

YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - NIGHT

Lights are on in the upper windows. A double-decker bus
passes on the wet street.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
INT. CORRIDOR, 145 PICCADILLY - CONTINUOUS
PAN OVER THE BACKS of 36 impeccably groomed horses. It takes
a moment to realize they are toy horses, lined up with
precision.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
‘The Flight’.
BERTIE (V.O.)
Oh, to fly away!
INT. CHILDREN’S NURSERY, YORK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled
on a bearskin rug reading to a little girl - LILIBET, 10 who claps her hands primly, and her younger sister - MARGARET
ROSE, 5.
As Elizabeth closes the book (”Peter Pan”), Bertie, handsome
in a tuxedo, comments:
BERTIE
Weren’t they lucky!
Within his family Bertie’s stammer is virtually absent.

14
MARGARET ROSE
Now Papa tell a story!
BERTIE
Could I be a penguin instead?
He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like
a penguin. Margaret Rose giggles, but is undeterred.
MARGARET ROSE
Tell me a penguin story, please.
Called upon to perform, the stammer returns slightly, but the
girls listen raptly, ignoring their father’s minor
impediment, and it fades.
BERTIE
There were once two princesses
whose Papa had been turned into a
penguin by the local witch. This
was inconvenient because he loved
to hold his princesses in his arms
and you can’t do that if you’re a
penguin, you have wings like
herrings.
MARGARET ROSE
Herrings don’t have wings.
BERTIE
His wings were the shape of
herrings. To make matters worse she
sent him to the South Pole which is
an awfully long walk if you can’t
fly.
LILIBET
You can’t walk from the South Pole!
Shh!

ELIZABETH

BERTIE
Exactly. When he reached the water
and dived in he found he could fly.
Fly through the depths. So fast, in
fact, that he was in Southampton
Waters by lunchtime. From there he
caught the 2.30 to Weybridge,
changed at Clapham Junction and
asked a passing Mallard the way to
Buckingham Palace. He swam up the
Thames and came out of a plughole,
giving Mama, the cook and Mrs
Whittaker quite a shock.
(MORE)

15
BERTIE (CONT'D)
The princesses heard the commotion
and hurried to the kitchen where
they gave the penguin a good scrub,
a mackerel and a kiss. And as they
kissed him guess what he turned
into?
LILIBET AND MARGARET ROSE
A handsome prince!
BERTIE
A short-tailed Albatross. With
wings big enough to wrap around
both his precious girls together.
(He hugs them both
together)
ELIZABETH
Now time for bed.
BERTIE
Take the saddles of your horsies,
brush them, feed them and to bed.
INT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
As they leave for the night:
ELIZABETH
Will she be there?
BERTIE
My brother’s insisting.
ELIZABETH
Is he serious?
BERTIE
About our coming to dinner?
ELIZABETH
No. About her!
BERTIE
A married American? He can’t be.
ELIZABETH
She can. By the way I think I found
someone rather interesting. On
Harley Street. A doctor.
BERTIE
Out of the question. I’m not having
this conversation again. The
matter’s settled.

ELIZABETH
His approach seems rather
different....
INT.

A STAGE - DAY

In a church or school hall, out of hours.
Now?

MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)

From the auditorium:
Now!

DIRECTOR (O.C.)

Lionel comes onstage.
LIONEL
“Now...”
(begins again)
“Now is the winter of our
discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of
York.”
His elocution is flawless. The acting is unconvincing.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
“And all the clouds that lour’d
upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried.
Now are our brows bound with
victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for
monuments...”
Thank you.

DIRECTOR

Lionel peers into the darkness, his eyes hoping.
DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Lovely diction, Mr...
LIONEL
Logue. Lionel Logue.
DIRECTOR
Well, Lionel, I didn’t hear the
cries of a deformed creature
yearning to be King. Nor did I
realize Richard the Third was King
of the Colonies.

17
LIONEL
I know the lines. I’ve played the
role before.
Sydney?
Perth.

DIRECTOR
LIONEL

DIRECTOR
Major theater town, is it?
LIONEL
Enthusiastic.
Ah.

DIRECTOR

LIONEL
I was well reviewed.
DIRECTOR
Yes...well...Lionel, I think our
dramatic society is looking for
someone slightly younger and a
little more regal.
INT. GROUND FLOOR ENTRANCE, 146 HARLEY STREET
The Yorks enter the tiny elevator.
Bertie shuts the inner gate.
ELIZABETH
(indicating outer gate)
No, darling, shut that one first.
Bertie gets the gates closed and Elizabeth presses the
button.
BERTIE
How did you find this...physician?
ELIZABETH
(poker-faced)
Classifieds, next to “French model,
Shepherd’s Market”.
Bertie tries to smile despite his mood, but doesn’t make a
job of it.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order
to help the poor. (realizes) Oh
dear, perhaps he’s a Bolshevik?!

18
INT. LOGUE’S WAITING ROOM - DAY
Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper:
ELIZABETH
No receptionist. He likes to keep
things simple.
Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(loudly)
The Johnsons.
From the inner office.
LIONEL (O.S.)
Finishing up.
Elizabeth is relieved the voice isn’t coming from the lav.
The consultation room door opens and a young boy - WILLY comes out.
WILLY
You can go in now, “Mr. Johnson”.
(then to Elizabeth)
Dr Logue says...
Lionel!

LIONEL (O.S.)

WILLY
Lionel says...wait here if you
wish, Mrs Johnson. Or, it being a ppleasant day, p-perhaps take a
stroll.
(to the consultation room)
Was that alright...Lionel?
Lionel appears at the door.
LIONEL
Bloody marvellous. You can stay
here and wait for your mum. Mr.
Johnson, do come in.
Lionel nods at “Mrs Johnson”.
The Yorks look at each other. Elizabeth takes a seat.
INT. LOGUE’S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY
A different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A world
of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two slightly
shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish rug.

Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Recording apparatus. Model
airplanes.
LIONEL
He’s a good lad, Willy. He could
hardly make a sound, you know, when
he first came to me.
Lionel catches Bertie staring at the airplanes.

My boys made those. Good, aren’t
they. Please, make yourself
comfortable.
Bertie sits uneasily on an armchair.

Lionel goes to sit at a

LIONEL (CONT’D)
I was told not not to sit too
close.
Bertie remains silent.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I was also told, speaking with a
Royal, one waits for the Royal to
choose the topic.
BERTIE
Waiting for me to commence a
conversation one can wait a rather
long wait.
[Although Bertie’s stammer in the consultation room will
fade, it is a gradual process.]
Silence.
LIONEL
Know any jokes?
BERTIE
Timing isn’t my strong suit.
Silence.

They stare at each other.
Cuppa tea?

LIONEL

BERTIE
No thank you.
LIONEL
I think I’ll have one.
Turns on the hot plate.

20
BERTIE
Aren’t you going to start treating
me Dr Logue?
LIONEL
Only if you’re interested in being
treated. Please, call me Lionel.
BERTIE
I prefer Doctor.
LIONEL
I prefer Lionel. What’ll I call
you?
BERTIE
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after
that.
LIONEL
A bit formal for here. What about
your name?
BERTIE
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur
George?
LIONEL
How about Bertie?
BERTIE
(flushes)
Only my family uses that.
LIONEL
Perfect. In here, it’s better if
we’re equals.
BERTIE
If we were equal I wouldn’t be
here. I’d be at home with my wife
and no-one would give a damn.
Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.
LIONEL
Don’t do that.
Bertie gives him an astonished look.
I’m sorry?

BERTIE

LIONEL
Sucking smoke into your lungs will
kill you.

21
BERTIE
My physicians say it relaxes the
throat.
LIONEL
They’re idiots.
BERTIE
They’ve all been knighted.
LIONEL
Makes it official then. My
‘castle’, my rules. What was your
earliest memory?
BERTIE
What an earth do you mean?
LIONEL
First recollection.
BERTIE
(stammer growing in
intensity)
I’m not here to discuss personal
matters.
LIONEL
Why’re you here then?
BERTIE
(exploding - stammer free)
Because I bloody well stammer!
Temper.

LIONEL

BERTIE
One of my many faults.
LIONEL
When did the defect start?
BERTIE
I’ve always been this way!
LIONEL
(quietly)
I doubt that.
BERTIE
Don’t tell me! It’s my defect!
LIONEL
(calmly)
It’s my field. I assure you, no
infant starts to speak with a
stammer. When did it start?

22
BERTIE
(annoyed)
Four or five.
LIONEL
That’s typical.
BERTIE
So I’ve been told.
(quickly adds)
I can’t remember not doing it.
LIONEL
That I believe. Do you hesitate
when you think?
BERTIE
Don’t be ridiculous.
LIONEL
One of my many faults. How about
when you talk to yourself?
Bertie is silent.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Everyone natters occasionally,

Stop calling me that!

I’m not going to call you anything
else.

Then we shan’t speak!
Silence. The kettle whistles.

Lionel makes himself a cup of

BERTIE (CONT’D)
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
LIONEL
A fortune. So, Bertie...when you
talk to yourself, do you stammer?
BERTIE
Of course not!
LIONEL
Thus proving your impediment isn’t
a permanent part of you. What do
you think was the cause?

23
BERTIE
I don’t know! I don’t care! I
stammer. And no one can fix it.
LIONEL
Bet you, Bertie, you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.
Bertie snorts dismissively.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
And if I win, I get to ask
questions.
BERTIE
And if I win?
LIONEL
You don’t have to answer.
BERTIE
One usually wagers money.
LIONEL
A bob each to sweeten it? See your
shilling.
BERTIE
I don’t carry cash.
LIONEL
I had a funny feeling you mightn’t.
Logue fishes two coins from his pocket and puts them on the
table.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Stake you. Pay me back next time.
BERTIE
If there is a next time.
LIONEL
(nods)
I haven’t agreed to take you on.
Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device
with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and
positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book.
Bertie glares at it defiantly.
BERTIE
I can’t possibly read this.
LIONEL
Then you owe me a shilling for not
trying.

24
Furious, Bertie opens the book and reads, stammers badly and
gets worse.
BERTIE
“To be or not to be, That is the
question. Whether it is wiser...”
There!
He hands the book back to Lionel.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
I can’t read!
LIONEL
I haven’t finished yet.
Lionel returns the book to Bertie and turns to some recording
apparatus on a nearby table.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I’m going to record your voice and
then play it back to you on the
same machine. This is brilliant.
It’s the latest thing from America:
a Silvertone.
He hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.

Bertie

LIONEL (CONT’D)
There’s a bob in this, mate. You
can go home rich!
Bertie reluctantly puts them on. Logue turns a dial. LOUD
MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
stops.
BERTIE
You’re playing music.
I know.

LIONEL

BERTIE
How can I hear what I’m saying?!
LIONEL
Surely a Prince’s brain knows what
its mouth is doing?
BERTIE
You’re not well acquainted with
Royal Princes, are you?
Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His
mouth moves as he reads, but all that can be heard is the
music.

25
Finished, Bertie takes off the earphones and the music
ceases. Bertie reaches for the coins, but Logue snatches
them.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
Hopeless. Hopeless!
LIONEL
You were sublime. Would I lie to a
prince of the realm to win twelvepence?
BERTIE
I’ve no idea what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.
LIONEL
Shall I play it?
No.

BERTIE

LIONEL
If you prefer, we’ll just get on to
the questions.
BERTIE
Thank you Doctor, I don’t feel this
is for me.
He heads for the door. Logue puts the record in a brown paper
dust jacket and hands it to Bertie.
LIONEL
Sir? The recording is free. Please
keep it as a souvenir?
Lionel opens the door for Bertie and closes it behind him

Elizabeth nods and rises. They walk towards the door

SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - DAY

Establishing shot in the snow.

26
A cold and commanding voice is heard:
KING GEORGE V (O.S.)
For the present, the work to which
we are all equally bound, is to
arrive at a reasoned
tranquillity...
INT. THE KING’S STUDY, SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
The King’s study, which resembles an orderly naval captain’s
cabin, except for a desk littered with stamp albums, has been
converted into an ad hoc broadcasting studio. KING GEORGE V
is a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and uniform.
He is giving his Christmas address via the radio.
KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
...within our borders, to regain
prosperity in this time of
depression without self-seeking and
to carry with us those whom the
burden of past years has
disheartened or overborne. To all,
to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
The red light next to him goes out, indicating the broadcast
is complete. Robert Wood, the BBC technician from Wembley,
stands by as well as an official photographer.
King George V looks at Bertie, who is standing next to him.
KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
Easy when you know how.
Sir?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Bertie moves away and the photographer captures the King,
seated at his desk.
KING GEORGE V
(to Bertie)
Have a go yourself.
WOOD
Congratulations, Sir.
KING GEORGE V
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow. Chap
taught me everything I know: let
the microphone do the work.
Sir.

WOOD

27

Thank you.

KING GEORGE V

Wood and the photographer take that as their cue to leave.
KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
Sit up, straight back, face boldly
up to the bloody thing and stare it
square in the eye, as you would any
decent Englishman. Show who’s in
command.
Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien
creature.
BERTIE
D-d-don’t thu-thu-think I c-c-can.
In the presence of his father, Bertie’s stammering returns in
full form, his breathing short and shallow, the neck muscles
in spasms.
KING GEORGE V
This devilish device will change
everything if you won’t. In the
past all a King had to do was look
respectable in uniform and not fall
off his horse. Now we must invade
people’s homes and ingratiate
ourselves with them. This family is
reduced to those lowest, basest of
all creatures...we’ve
become...actors!
BERTIE
Papa, we’re not a family, we’re a
firm.
His father shoots Bertie a surprised look: does the lad have
a brain after all?
KING GEORGE V
The most successful institution in
history. Our cousins wear crowns
throughout Europe. A dozen of them!
Sitting on thrones is our business!
Yet any moment some of us may be
out of work. Your darling
brother... The only wife he appears
interested in is invariably the
wife of another!
BERTIE
(tries to brighten things)
He’s broken off with Lady Furness.

28
KING GEORGE V
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman
with two husbands living! Had the
audacity to present her to me at
Georgie’s wedding. I told him
straight no divorced person could
ever be received at court. He said
she made him sublimely happy. I
imagined that was because she was
sleeping with him. “I give you my
word we’ve never had immoral
relations,” he replied. Stared
square into his father’s eyes...
and lied.
Bertie groans.
KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
When I’m dead that boy will ruin
himself, this family, and this
nation, within twelve months.
Who’ll pick up the pieces? Herr
Hitler, intimidating half of
Europe, Marshall Stalin the other
half? Who’ll stand between us, the
jackboots, and the proletarian
abyss? You? With your older brother
shirking his duties, you’re going
to have to do a lot more of this.
(nodding towards the
microphone)
Have a go yourself.
Bertie tries to read the King’s speech.
BERTIE
Through one of the mKING GEORGE V
Get it out boy!
BERTIE

your words carefully
BERTIE

inability)
Just try it!

BERTIE

(all patience lost)
Do it!
INT. BERTIE’S STUDY, YORK HOUSE - NEW NIGHT
Bertie lies on a chaise longue, smoking.
BERTIE
(to himself)
Lying bastard.
Bertie gets up and retrieves the recording he made with
Lionel. He walks to a Victoria stand, lifts the arm, places
the steel needle. It slips and slides across the records
surface, as steel needles do. But what he hears is poetic and
flowing:
BERTIE’S RECORDED VOICE
“To be, or not to be, - that is the
question: Elizabeth enters, unseen by Bertie and listens.
BERTIE’S RECORDED VOICE (CONT’D)
“...whether tis nobler in the mind
to suffer The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of
troubles, And by opposing end
them..”
Hold on Elizabeth, stunned: Unable to hear himself, her
husband speaks perfectly for the very first time.
INT.

LOGUE’S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY

Bertie and Elizabeth have returned to the consultation room.
BERTIE
Strictly business. No personal
nonsense.
ELIZABETH
I thought I’d made that very clear
in our interview.
Logue is silent, then:
LIONEL
Got the shilling you owe me?

30
BERTIE
No I don’t!
LIONEL
Didn’t think so.
BERTIE
Besides, you tricked me!
LIONEL
No, I showed you what you can do.
(tries to get them to
understand)
What you’re asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.
ELIZABETH
That’s sufficient. My husband has
difficulties with his speech. Just
deal with that.
BERTIE
I’m willing to work hard, Doctor
Logue...
Lionel.

LIONEL

BERTIE
Are you willing to do your part?
Logue considers, then tells Bertie:
LIONEL
Alright. You want mechanics? We
need to relax your throat muscles
and strengthen your tongue. By
repeating tongue twisters for
example. “I am a thistle-sifter. I
have a sieve of sifted thistles and
a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter.”
Fine.

BERTIE

LIONEL
You have a flabby tummy, we must
build up the strength in your
diaphragm. Simple mechanics.
ELIZABETH
That is all we ask.
LIONEL
And that’s about a shilling’s
worth.

31
BERTIE
Forget about the blessed shilling!
(calm again)
Perhaps, upon occasion, I shall
request some assistance in coping
with a minor event. Will that be
agreeable?
Of course.

LIONEL

ELIZABETH
That will be the full extent of
your services.
BERTIE
Shall I see you next week?
LIONEL
I shall see you every day.
On Bertie, reacting.
MONTAGE
Many different sessions, many different days, all in the
consultation room.
CU of Bertie’s mouth. Humming.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Hum for as long as you like.
Hmmmmmmmmmm. And when you’re ready,
“Mother”.
BERTIE
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmother.
Beaut.

LIONEL

LIONEL (CONT’D)
A simple outward breath. “FFFFF”
Wait for the “aa”. “FFFFFather”.
Just slide into it.
BERTIE
FFFFFFFFFFFFather.
CUT TO:
LIONEL
Feel the loosening of the jaw

32
Bertie and Lionel both have their individual hands clasped
and are shaking them, vibrating their chest and loosening
their jaw. As their jaws wobble, they omit a vibrating sound.
BERTIE
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
LIONEL
(at the same time)
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,
CUT TO:
Bertie lies on the floor
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Deep breath. Expand your
chest...lift your diaphragm...allow
the column of air into your
stomach...How do you feel?
BERTIE
Full of hot air.
LIONEL
Isn’t that what public speaking is
all about?
Bertie inhales deeply.
CUT TO:
Some fast cuts. Lionel handing him a cup of tea. Bertie doing
slow breathing exercises. Bertie shouting something in
frustration.
BERTIE
I will never get that.
LIONEL
Yes you can, come on, come on.
CUT TO:
Bertie’s on the floor again.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Deep breath. Hold.
He turns to Elizabeth.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Now Ma’am, while you are here, you
could again be of great assistance.
If you’d kindly sit on your
husband’s stomach.

33

Oh yes?

ELIZABETH

LIONEL
Gently of course.
Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie’s stomach, asking
solicitously:
ELIZABETH
Are you alright, Bertie?
Bertie nods.
LIONEL
Now exhale slowly...can you feel
that resistance, Bertie? Down goes
your Royal Highness...inhale
slowly...and...up comes your Royal
Highness. Exhale and down. Yes.
Inhale and up. You get the idea.
ELIZABETH
This is actually quite good fun,
Bertie.
LIONEL
Do it at home. Doesn’t have to be
you, of course, but I thought he’d
prefer you to one of the staff.
Lionel encourages Bertie to move as he reads a joke out.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Move, rock back and forth on the
balls of your feet, keep the
movement continuous and flowing.
CUT TO:
Bertie stands framed by the open window.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I want you to release the five
vowel sounds, each to last no less
than 15 seconds.
BERTIE
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
LIONEL
(tapping him on the
diaphragm)
Let’s connect the toned diaphragm
with your relaxed throat. Ma’am,
would you be so kind as to be the
timekeeper?

34
Lionel hands her a stop watch.
BERTIE
....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.....
High up in the wall at the back of the building, a Harley
Street physician peers out the window.
LIONEL
Anyone who can vibrate loudly in
full view of the world can learn to
give a speech.
ELIZABETH
That’s right, Bertie.

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
Lionel joins in.
LIONEL
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.....

MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY

Huge industrial wheels whir noisily in neutral as WORKERS
line up dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie’s lips
move, but due to the racket he cannot be heard. Elizabeth
watches in relief.
A FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals. The machinery
halts, the factory falls silent. At first, the momentum of
speaking without being heard carries Bertie forward.
BERTIE
I assure you that my wife and I...
Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous
factory Bertie’s stammer returns.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
...ar-ar-are glad to vis-visvisit...
Bertie pauses. Takes a breath. Relaxes.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
...are glad to visit this important
manufacturing district and see for
ourselves one or two of the
industries which have made it
famous...

He gets back into his stride, despite the silence. Bertie
relaxes a little. From Elizabeth, a huge smile of relief.
The sound of an approaching aircraft engine.

The cockpit canopy slides back and - DAVID - leaps out,
removing his leather helmet and goggles, gold hair gleaming,
a sun god descended from the skies.
DAVID

Bertie stammers badly in the presence of his brother.

KING’S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - DAY

The King is propped up in his armchair, wrapped in his
favorite faded Tibetan dressing gown. He’s attended by six
members of his Privy Council - ARCHBISHOP LANG, LORD DAWSON
his personal physician, LORD WIGRAM his private secretary,
together with RAMSAY MACDONALD, LORD HAILSHAM and SIR JOHN
SIMON. Also present is SIR MAURICE HANKEY, the Clerk to the
Council.
The King’s sons and daughter are in attendance. SISTER BLACK
his nurse, stands beside the King.
Lord Wigram is reading out the Order for the Council for the
State. The King constantly interjects. He is confused and
frail.
LORD WIGRAM
... whereas by letters patent under
the Great Seal, bearing date of
Westminster, the eleventh June 1912
his Majesty King George V did
constitute, order and declare that
there should be a guardian, Custos
Regni, in the form of Councillors
of State.
Off King George V’s confusion LORD WIGRAM (CONT’D)
It’s the order of the Council for
the State, Sir. So we may act on
your behalf.
Wigram presents a tray with papers and pen.
KING GEORGE V
I’m still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.

David is on the phone. Bertie enters.
DAVID
I’m on with Wallis!
(continues as though
Bertie didn’t exist)
I know, darling, a talk, even a
lovely long talk, is a poor
substitute for holding tight and
making drowsy. Nor making our own
drowsies either, as we’ve had to do
far too often lately.

hangs up)
Wallis misses me terribly.

No, no, he’s quieter now.
The butler enters and whispers to Lord Dawson and Lord
Wigram. They both exit.

would not be tolerated. None of
this..unpleasantness would be
tolerated
Pause.
COSMO LANG
(to David)
You know Sir, I appreciate that you
are different from your father in
your outlook and temperament. I
want you to know that whenever the
King questioned your conduct, I
tried in your interest to present
it in a most favourable light.
DAVID

I can always trust you to have my
best interests at heart.
Awkward silence.

LOGUE’S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY

Lionel is at his desk listening to the radio. A news reader
is talking about the death of King George V.

a break from homework, building a model airplane.
He switches off the wireless.

What?

ANTONY

ANTONY
Time for a Shake, dad?
LIONEL

You sure? Allright put your
thinking caps on.

Go on, Dad.
This was, and still is, a much loved ritual. Lionel
disappears behind a door..

No, I bet it’s Othello. It’s always
Othello.
LIONEL (OOMING OUT)

Caliban!
LIONEL
Oh! For heaven’s sake.. that was a
lucky guess!
ANTONY
Don’t listen to egghead. Go on,
Dad.
Lionel has a pillow stuffed into his jacket to create a
monstrous hunchback. His acting, performed just for his lads,
is quite magical.
LIONEL
“Be not afeard; the isle is full of
noises,
Sounds and sweet airs, that give
delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a
thousand twanging instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and
sometimes voices,
That, if then I had waked after
long sleep,
Will make me sleep again:” (to
Valentine) Alright, clever clogs,
what comes next?
VALENTINE
“..and then, in dreaming, The
clouds methought would open, and

LIONEL
At least there was free beer.
Pause.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Here’s to the memory of your
father.
They sit.
BERTIE
I was informed, after the fact, my
father’s last words were: “Bertie
has more guts than the rest of his
brothers put together.” He couldn’t
say that to my face.
Silence.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
(blurts)
My brother. That’s why I’m here.
LIONEL
What’s he done?
Can’t say.

BERTIE
I can’t puh-puh-puh...

His jaw and throat muscles constrict.

Pardon?

Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.

BERTIE
“Swanee River”.
LIONEL
I love that song.
BERTIE
Happens to be my favorite.
LIONEL
Sing it then. Give me the chorus.
BERTIE
Certainly not.
(fascinated by the plane)
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn’t allow it. He
collected stamps. I had to collect
stamps.
No.

LIONEL
You can finish that off.
Bertie eagerly reaches for some balsa.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
If you sing.
(to “Swanee River”)
“When I was a boy with David...upon
the Swanee River.”
BERTIE
I can’t sit here singing!
LIONEL
You can with me.
BERTIE
Because you’re peculiar.
LIONEL
I take that as a compliment.
BERTIE
I’m not crooning “Swanee River!”
LIONEL
Try “Camptown Races” then.
(sings)
“My brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah...” Continuous sound
will give you flow. Does it feel
strange, now that David’s on the
throne?
BERTIE
It was a relief... Knowing I
wouldn’t be King.

44
Reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case. Then
remembers, puts it away.
LIONEL
But unless he produces an heir,
you’re next in line. And your
daughter, Elizabeth, would then
succeed you.
BERTIE
“You’re barking up the wrong tree
now, Doctor, Doctor.”
LIONEL
“Lionel, Lionel.” You didn’t
stammer.
BERTIE
Of course I didn’t stammer, I was
singing!
(realises)
Oh...
LIONEL
Well, as a little reward, you get
to put some glue on these struts.
BERTIE
David and I were very close. Young
bucks... You know.
LIONEL
Chase the same girls?
BERTIE
David was always very helpful in
arranging introductions. We shared
the expert ministrations of
“Paulette” in Paris. Not at the
same time of course.
An uncomfortable silence. Too much has been said.
LIONEL
Did David tease you?
BERTIE
They all did. “Buh-buh-buh-Bertie”.
Father encouraged it. “Get it out,
boy!” Said it would make me stop.
Said...”I was afraid of my father,
and my children are damn well going
to be afraid of me”.
Lionel has been watching Bertie work on the model.
LIONEL
Naturally right handed?

45
BERTIE
Left. I was punished. Now I use the
right.
LIONEL
Yes, that’s very common with
stammerers. Anything other
corrections?
BERTIE
Knock knees.
Lionel waits.

Metal splints were made...worn
night and day.
LIONEL
That must have been painful.
BERTIE
Bloody agony. Straight legs now.
LIONEL
Who were you closest to in your
family?
BERTIE
Nannies. Not my first nanny,
though..she loved David...hated me.
When I was presented to my parents
for the daily viewing, she’d...
The stammering produced by the memory halts him.
Sing it.

LIONEL

BERTIE
(tunelessly)
“She pinch me so I’d cry,
and be sent away at once,
then she wouldn’t feed me, far far
away.”
(speaks)
Took three years for my parents to
notice. As you can imagine, it
caused some stomach problems.
Still.
LIONEL
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
BERTIE
Sweet boy. Epilepsy...and...he
was ’different’.

Lionel gets up to pour another drink.
BERTIE (CONT’D)

LIONEL

BERTIE
...I’ve ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the
streets and see, you know, the
Common Man staring at me, I’m
struck by how little I know of his
life, and how little he knows of
mine.
LIONEL
What’re friends for.
BERTIE
I wouldn’t know.
ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF KING GEORGE V’S STATE FUNERAL
The common man, and woman, en masse. Thousands of them,
solemn in their bereavement.
Funereal bagpipes wail, joining the measured drum-rolls.
Ranks upon ranks of military personnel slow-stepping the
ceremonial death march.
Muffled cannons bark their salute.
Startled, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and streak
across the wintery sky.

coffin draped with the Royal standard, on which rests the
Royal crown topped by a jeweled Maltese Cross.
On Whitehall, the gun carriage passes the Cenotaph.

Bertie, in the procession passing by.
Lionel stares at him. Tries to make eye contact. In the midst
of this pomp and ceremony the immense potential importance of
his client sinks in. Of course, Bertie doesn’t see him.

You’re not fat.
ELIZABETH
I’m getting plump.
BERTIE
You seldom cook.
She gives her husband a look, but realizes he’s teasing. She
gasps and points:

ELIZABETH

BALLROOM, BALMORAL - DAY

A weekend house party. Drinks at teatime. Five or six friends
dance to a gramophone. A couple are already drunk. At the
epicenter, David, the very picture of insouciance, and
WALLIS, clinging to his arm, dripping in jewelry. Wallis’
most attractive physical feature is her back, displayed fully
by her choice of dress. Surrounded by their entourage, they
are the apex of chic.
A FOOTMAN announces:
FOOTMAN
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and
Duchess of York.
Elizabeth freezes as Wallis sweeps forward to greet them.
WALLIS
How lovely to see you both. Welcome
to our little country shack.
Elizabeth stares at her, incredulous, then sails past,
announcing to no one in particular:
ELIZABETH
I came at the invitation of the
King.
Wallis is wrongfooted. Elizabeth and Bertie reach David.
Elizabeth curtsies to David, and Bertie gives David a nod.
BERTIE
Hello David.
DAVID
Hello Bertie. Hello Elizabeth.
David kisses Elizabeth on both cheeks.
BERTIE
I see you’re making some changes to
the garden.
DAVID
I am. I am not quite finished.
David’s eyes are drawn by Wallis.
David!

WALLIS

50
She taps her champagne glass.
A footman goes into action, but Wallis waves him off. David
leaves instead.
DAVID
(calling to Wallis)
Just be a sec, darling!
Bertie pursues him.
One of the guests - WINSTON CHURCHILL - nursing a glass of
champagne moves up to Elizabeth.
INT.

DRAWING ROOM/PORTRAIT GALLERY, BALMORAL

- DAY

Elizabeth is standing in front of a canvas of George IV when
Churchill arrives at her side.
ELIZABETH
Don’t tell me I behaved badly, Mr
Churchill.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
On the contrary, your Royal
Highness. Etiquette decrees royalty
must be greeted by the official
host: in this case: the King. Not a
commoner. You behaved impeccably.
As always.
Thank you.

ELIZABETH

WINSTON CHURCHILL
I’m always amused when you’re
referred to as being a commoner. As
common as the Scottish kings from
whom you descend.
ELIZABETH
Your flattery is profound. What is
your agenda, Mr Churchill?
WINSTON CHURCHILL
(pause, then)
Did she actually say what I thought
she said?
ELIZABETH
You know she did.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
What is her hold on him?

51
ELIZABETH
Apparently she has
certain...skills, which she learnt
in an establishment in Shanghai.
Churchill almost spills his new champagne.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Mam, I’d not realized you were so
well versed in such matters.
They catch a distant glimpse of David hurrying down a
corridor, followed by Bertie, determined to catch up.
INT. CORRIDOR, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS
Bertie catches his brother.
BERTIE
I’ve been trying to see you...
DAVID
I’ve been terribly busy.
BERTIE
Doing what?
Kinging.

DAVID

BERTIE
Really? Kinging? Kinging is a
precarious business! Where is the
Tsar of Russia? Where is Cousin
Wilhelm?
DAVID
You’re being dreary.
BERTIE
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff
at Sandringham and buying yet more
pearls for Wallis while there are
people marching across Europe
singing “The Red Flag”?
DAVID
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler
will sort that lot out.
BERTIE
Who’ll sort out Herr Hitler?
David hurries down some stairs.

52
INT. SERVANT’S CORRIDOR/WINE CELLAR - DAY
David is hunting for a bottle of champagne for Wallis in the
wine cellar.
BERTIE
And you’ve put that woman into our
mother’s suite?
DAVID
Mother’s not still in the bed, is
she?
BERTIE
That’s not funny.
David finds the bottle he was looking for.
DAVID
Wally likes the very best.
BERTIE
I don’t care what woman you carry
on with at night, as long as you
show up for duty in the morning!
He exits. Bertie follows.
INT. HALLWAY BALMORAL - DAY
DAVID
This is not just some woman I am
carrying on with. This is the woman
I intend to marry
Excuse me?

BERTIE

DAVID
She’s filing a petition for
divorce.
Good God.

BERTIE

INT. HALLWAY/DRAWING ROOM, BALMORAL - DAY
BERTIE
Can’t you just give her a nice
house and a title?
DAVID
I won’t have her as my mistress.

53
BERTIE
David, the Church does not
recognise divorce and you are the
head of the Church.
DAVID
Haven’t I any rights?
BERTIE
Many privileges...
DAVID
Not the same thing. Your beloved
Common Man may marry for love, why
not me?
BERTIE
If you were the Common Man, on what
basis could you possibly claim to
be King?!
DAVID
Sounds like you’ve studied our
wretched constitution.
BERTIE
Sounds like you haven’t.
DAVID
Is that what this is all about? Is
that why you’ve been taking
elocution lessons?
BERTIE
I’m attempting t-t...
DAVID
That’s the scoop around town.
Yearning for a larger audience are
we, B-b-b-bertie?
BERTIE
D-don’t say such a thDAVID
Young brother trying to push older

Bertie is completely locked.
David heads for Wallis, leaving his brother totally
distraught. He pours her a glass of champagne. She shows she
is pleased with him.

54
INT. LOGUE’S CONSULTATION ROOM, HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY
Bertie stands shattered, lost in painful memory.
BERTIE
All that work, down the drain. My
own brother... I couldn’t say...I
could say...I couldn’t say a word
in reply!
LIONEL
Why do you stammer more with David
than you do with me?
BERTIE
Because you’re bloody well paid to
listen!
The latter, angry, sentence is flawless.
LIONEL
I’m not a geisha girl.
BERTIE
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
LIONEL
What is it about David that stops
you speaking?
BERTIE
What the bloody hell is it that
makes you bloody well want to go on
about David?
LIONEL
Vulgar but fluent. You don’t
stammer when you swear.
BERTIE
Bugger off!
LIONEL
Is that the best you can do?
BERTIE
Well bloody bugger to you, you
beastly bastard.
LIONEL
A public school prig can do better
than that.
BERTIE
Shit then. Shit, shit, shit!

55
LIONEL
See how defecation flows trippingly
from the tongue?
BERTIE
Because I’m angry!
LIONEL
Ah. Know the f-word?
BERTIE
Fornication?
Bertie.

LIONEL

Lionel gives him a look.
BERTIE
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!
LIONEL
Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
BERTIE
Bloody, bloody, bloody! Shit, shit,
shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck,
fuck, fuck!
A knocking on the wall.
ANTONY (O.S.)
Dad? What’s going on?
LIONEL
(calls)
Sorry. Finish your homework.
Bertie laughs.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Well that’s a side of you we don’t
get to see that often.
BERTIE
No. No we’re not supposed to
really, not publicly.
LIONEL
Can’t joke, can’t laugh?
(then referring to Antony
on the other side of the
wall)
Let’s get some air.
BERTIE
No Logue, I don’t think that’s a
good idea.

56
Lionel throws him his hat and scarf.
LIONEL
Put on your spy clobber.
EXT. REGENT’S PARK ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - DAY
Bertie and Logue come into view talking. Bertie with his
homburg pulled low, scarf wrapped high. The park is empty and
bleak on this winter’s day. One can feel the cold chill;
puffs of steam punctuating their words like smoke signals.
LIONEL
What’s wrong? What’s got you so
upset?
BERTIE
Logue, you have no idea. My brother
is infatuated with a woman who’s
been married twice - and she’s
American.
LIONEL
Some of them must be loveable.
BERTIE
(shoots him a look)
She’s asking for a divorce and
David is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
LIONEL
That’s not right. Queen Wallis of
Baltimore?
BERTIE
Unthinkable.
LIONEL
Can he do that?
BERTIE
Absolutely not. But he’s going to
anyway. All hell’s broken loose.
LIONEL
Can’t they carry on privately?
BERTIE
If only they would.
LIONEL
Where does that leave you?

57
BERTIE
I know my place! I’ll do anything
within my power to keep my brother
on the throne.
LIONEL
Has it come to that? But the way
things are going, your place may be
on the throne.
BERTIE
I am not an alternative to my
brother.
LIONEL
If you had to you could outshine
David...
Lionel reaches out and gives Bertie a pat of comfort on the
shoulder. Bertie pulls back in offended shock.
BERTIE
Don’t take liberties! That’s
bordering on treason.
LIONEL
I’m just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
BERTIE
That is treason!
They face each other, as though in combat.
LIONEL
I’m trying to get you to realise
you need not be governed by fear.
BERTIE
I’ve had enough of this!
LIONEL
What’re you afraid of?
BERTIE
Your poisonous words!
LIONEL
Why’d you show up then? To take
polite elocution lessons so you can
chit-chat at posh tea parties?
BERTIE
Don’t instruct me on my duties! I’m
the brother of a King...the son of
a King...we have a history that
goes back untold centuries. You’re
the disappointing son of a brewer!

58
BERTIE (CONT'D)
A jumped-up jackeroo from the
outback! You’re nobody. These
sessions are over!
Bertie strides off in a fury. Lionel, equally angry, goes in
the other direction. Two men moving apart in the cold
wintery landscape, the ground mist rising.
The Lionel stops. Turns.
POV - Bertie has disappeared from view.
CLOSE ON LIONEL as he realises...he’s no longer therapist to
a man who might have to become King.
EXT. BACK GARDEN ENTRANCE, 10 DOWNING STREET/HORSE GUARDS
PARADE - DAY
A car pulls up. A bundled figure hurries out and slips in
thru the garden entrance.
INT.

BALDWIN’S STUDY, 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY

Bertie is with Prime Minister STANLEY BALDWIN, a stocky man
with his hair parted straight down the middle. Their
conversation in progress.
BALDWIN
It’s not just because she’s an
American. It’s that she is soon to
be a twice divorced American, and
the King can not marry a divorced
woman. I apologize for the nature
of this, but... according to
Scotland Yard, the King does not
possess exclusive rights to Mrs.
Simpson’s favours and affections,
sharing them with a married used
car salesman, a certain Mr Guy
Trundle. In addition, it is
rumoured that Hitler’s ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17
carnations every day......
Silence.
BALDWIN (CONT’D)
Should your brother continue to
ignore the advice of His
Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no
choice but to resign.
BERTIE
Prime Minister, you’d leave the
country without a government?

59
BALDWIN
Does the King do what he wants, or
does he do what his people expect
him to do?
INT. LIVING ROOM, LOGUE APARTMENT - NIGHT
The family is listening to a favorite radio show.
MYRTLE
What’s the matter, love?
Nothing.

LIONEL

Lionel shrugs helplessly, glances at the boys.
MYRTLE
You look a bit blue.
LIONEL
Just trouble with a client.
Oh yes.

MYRTLE

LIONEL
Frightened of his own shadow.
MYRTLE
Isn’t that why they come to you?
LIONEL
But this chap...
Yes?

MYRTLE

LIONEL
This chap truly could be somebody
great, and he’s fighting me.
MYRTLE
Perhaps he doesn’t want to be
great.
Lionel is silent.
MYRTLE (CONT’D)
Perhaps that’s what you want.
LIONEL
I might have overstepped the mark.

60
MYRTLE
Apologize, Lionel. Do you both
good. Sometimes you do push a bit
hard.
INT. HALLWAY, 145 PICCADILLY - CONTINUOUS
Lionel is shown to a chair in the hall to wait. Footsteps
echo.
Bertie’s Equerry, dressed in military uniform, comes in. He
is scrupulously polite.
EQUERRY
I’m very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke
is terrible busy.
LIONEL
I’m happy to wait. Or I could come
back later.
EQUERRY
As I said, the Duke is busy.
The steward opens the door. Both wait.
Lionel reluctantly withdraws.
INT.

BERTIE’S STUDY, 145 PICCADILLY - NIGHT

Bertie and Chuchill sit on either side of Bertie’s desk.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
But there were other reasons for
concern, Sir. He was careless with
state papers. He lacked commitment
and resolve. There were those that
worried where he would stand when
war with Germany comes.
BERTIE
We’re not coming to that?
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister
Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler’s
intent is crystal clear. War with
Germany will come, and we will need
a King behind whom we can all stand
united.
Silence.
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
Have you thought what you will call
yourself?

61
Bertie struggles to speak with the shock of the question.
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
Certainly not Albert, Sir. Too
Germanic.
Pause.
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
What about George? After your
father? George the sixth. It has
rather a nice continuity to it,
don’t you think.

DAVID’S DRAWING ROOM, THE FORT - DAY

Bertie waits nervously for David.
David enters, looking sunken.
BERTIE
David! Thank God. You look
exhausted! How are you bearing up?
DAVID
Bertie. I have to go. The
decision’s been made.
BERTIE
I cannot accept that. You are in no
condition to make that decision.
DAVID
I’m afraid there’s no other way. I
must marry her. My mind’s made up.
I’m... sorry.
BERTIE
That’s a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that. I least
of all.
INT. - DRAWING ROOM, THE FORT - DAY
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
At long last I am able to say a few
words of my own. I have never
wanted to withhold anything, but
until now, it has not been
constitutionally possible for me to
speak. A few hours ago I discharged
my last duty as King and Emperor.

62
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D)
Now that I have been succeeded by
my brother, the Duke of York my
first words must be to declare my
allegiance to him. This I do with

Bertie, Henry and George are there to witness David signing
the abdication document.
Silence. The scratching of a fountain pen.
He finally signs his name. The others sign.
Bertie signs.
HOLD ON Bertie’s face.
INT. STUDY, WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT
David sits at his desk on which sits a BBC microphone. As
always he speaks with beautiful fluency.
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me when I tell
you I have found it impossible to
carry the heavy burden of
responsibility and to discharge my
duties as King as I would wish to
do without the help and support of
the woman I love...
INT.

DRAWING ROOM, YORK HOUSE - NIGHT

ANOTHER WIRELESS being listened to by Elizabeth and Bertie.
DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)

Bertie battles his emotions. Elizabeth takes Bertie’s hand
supportively.

DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
...will be able to take my place
forthwith without interruption or
injury to the life and progress of

Grimly, Bertie gets in to a waiting Rolls. Framed in the car
window he looks terrified as the car edges from the curb.
On the pavement, kept back by police, a crowd of onlookers.
On the edge of the group...Lionel.
Bertie peers out of the window of the Rolls. Their eyes meet.
Bertie looks away. The Rolls drives on.
INT. ANTECHAMBER, ST JAMES PALACE - THAT DAY
Bertie waits nervously.
At a signal from his attendants he enters the Accession
Council Chamber
INT.

ACCESSION COUNCIL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The Council is made up of Privy Councillors, members of the
House of Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the
Aldermen of the City of London and the High Commissioners of
some Commonwealth countries.
Standing before them, Bertie is handed his Accession speech.
All of Bertie’s old symptoms reappear: the tightening of the
neck muscles, the protruding Adam’s apple, the jaw locking.
BERTIE
I meet you today in circumstances
which are Bertie has come to a complete muscle-locked halt. He bows his
head in humility. And shame.
INT.

HALLWAY, YORK HOUSE - THAT DAY

Elizabeth is with her daughters, preparing for the move to
Buckingham Palace. The girls are tidying away their toy
horses.
LILLIBET
Mama, will we have space for our
horses in our new home?

64
ELIZABETH
Of course we will, darling, we’ll
have a palace of rooms.
Bertie appears, still in full regalia, straight from the
Accession Council. He tries to put on a brave front, but it
doesn’t quite work. He desperately needs the comfort of his
family.
He holds his arm out, expecting his daughters to run to him
for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal.
LILLIBET
(to her sister, on seeing
her father)
Curtsey.
MARGARET
Your Majesty.
They remain where they are and curtsy formally. Bertie is
devastated.
ELIZABETH
How was it?
Bertie shakes his head imperceptibly.
INT.

BERTIE’S STUDY, YORK HOUSE - NIGHT

Bertie valiantly tries to make sense of his new dispatch box
filled with state papers, seated at his desk. It is late at
night.
Elizabeth enters, in night clothes.
BERTIE
I’m trying to familiarise myself
with what a state paper looks like.
He picks up a series of papers.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I
don’t understand a word of. David’s
finances. The Christmas broadcast I think that might be a mistake.
ELIZABETH
Don’t do it then.
BERTIE
Plans for the Coronation - I think
that’s an even bigger mistake. I’m
not a King. I’m a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know about.

65
And Bertie breaks down; fierce, wracking sobs.
Elizabeth speaks softly, with growing strength, having
already accepted and adapted to the situation.
ELIZABETH
Dear, dear man... I refused your
first two marriage proposals, not
because I didn’t love you, but
because I couldn’t bear the royal
cage. Could bear the idea of a life
of tours and public duties, a life
that no longer was really to be my
own. Then I thought...he stammers
so beautifully...they’ll leave us
alone.
She takes his anguished face in her hands tenderly.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
But if I must be Queen, I intend be
a very good Queen. Queen to a very
great King indeed.

A knock at the front door.
Two figures can be seen outlined in the frosted glass door.
Lionel opens it.
Bertie and Elizabeth are standing there.
BERTIE
Waiting for a king to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.
ELIZABETH
I’m afraid we’re slightly late.
Beat.
LIONEL
This is home. Myrtle’s at bridge.
I’ve made sure the boys are out.
ELIZABETH
(stepping in)
It’s lovely. Absolutely lovely.
Lionel pulls out a chair for her to sit down.

66
LIONEL
Would you like some tea, Ma’am?
ELIZABETH
Yes. I’ll help myself.
(then)
Off you go now. Or must I knock
your heads together?
INT. LOGUE’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
The two men enter and sit down. A moment of uncertainty. Then
Bertie blurts.
BERTIE
Here’s your shilling, Logue
(puts shilling down)
I understand what you were trying
to say, Logue.
LIONEL
I went about it the wrong way. I’m
sorry.
BERTIE
Now here I am. Is the nation ready
for two minutes of radio silence?
LIONEL
Every stammerer always fears they
will fall back to square one. I
don’t let that happen. You won’t
let that happen.
BERTIE
If I fail in my duty... David could
come back. I’ve seen the placards
“Save Our King!” They don’t mean
me. Every other monarch in history
succeeded someone who was dead, or
about to be. My predecessor is not
only alive, but very much so. What
a bloody mess! I can’t even give
them a Christmas Speech.
LIONEL
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.

BERTIE

LIONEL
Your father. He’s not here.
BERTIE
Yes he is. He’s on that bloody
shilling I gave you.

67
LIONEL
Easy enough to give away. You don’t
have to carry him around in your
pocket. Or your brother. You don’t
need to be afraid of things you
were afraid of when you were five.
A pause LIONEL (CONT’D)
You’re very much your own man,
Bertie. Your face is next, mate.
There’s a noise outside the door.
Lionel?
Myrtle!

MYRTLE (O.S.)
LIONEL

Lionel stands and pressed himself up against the wall.
BERTIE
Are you alright, Lionel?
Yes.

LIONEL

Bertie stands and makes towards the door.
BERTIE
Shall we go through?
LIONEL

Trust me it’s important.
BERTIE
What is it?
INT. PARLOUR, LOGUE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Myrtle has entered, she is flabbergasted.

68
INT. LOGUE’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
Lionel, still pressed against the wall, is explaining his
reticence to Bertie.
LIONEL
I haven’t told her.. about us. Sit

Bertie, bemused, sits.

ELIZABETH
I’m informed your husband calls my

ELIZABETH
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue
Myrtle is taken aback.
INT. LOGUE’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
The men listen to their wives’ conversation.
BERTIE
Logue, we can’t stay here all day.
LIONEL
Yes we can.
Logue..

BERTIE

LIONEL
Look, I need to wait for the
opportune moment.
BERTIE
(realizing)
You’re being a coward!
LIONEL
You’re damn right.
Decisive, Bertie stands and throws open the door.
BERTIE
Get out there, man!

69
And Bertie ushers Lionel into the parlour.
INT. PARLOUR, LOGUE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Logue enters, pretending total innocence and surprise,
followed by Bertie.
LIONEL
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You’re
early.(indicating Elizabeth) I
believe you two have met! I don’t
believe you know....King George VI?
BERTIE
It’s very nice to meet you.
Myrtle stares at Lionel and takes her revenge.
MYRTLE
Will their Majesties be staying for
dinner?
Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken. Elizabeth comes to the
rescue.
ELIZABETH
We would love to, such a treat, but
alas...a previous engagement. What
a pity.
On Lionel’s relief.
EXT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
To establish. Preparations are being made in the street for
the coronation - spectator stands are complete and fabric is

INT.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

The center piece of the Coronation staging is the throne of
Edward the Confessor. Scaffolding has been erected to supply
seating. Technicians work to erect film cameras, lights,
radio microphones.
They stop short as they see Cosmo Lang waiting to greet them,
flanked by the Dean of Westminster and a couple of flunkies.
There is a distinct drop in temperature.
BERTIE
Archbishop.

70
COSMO LANG
Welcome your Majesty.
(referring to the
cathedral, but it’s
double-edge)
What a glorious transformation,
Sir. I hope you’ll forgive us if we
continue our preparations. Allow me
to guide you through the ceremony.
They begin to walk together, Lionel a few paces behind.
COSMO LANG (CONT’D)
We begin, of course at the West
Door, then into the nave.
BERTIE
I see all your pronouncements are
to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Cosmo sees Bertie staring at the microphones.
COSMO LANG
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a
Pandora’s Box. I’m afraid I’ve also
had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall
personally edit.
LIONEL
Without momentary hesitation.
BERTIE
Doctor Lionel Logue of Harley
Street, my speech specialist.
COSMO LANG
Specialist?! Had I known Your
Majesty was seeking assistance I
would’ve made my own
recommendation.
BERTIE
Dr. Logue is to be present at the
Coronation.
COSMO LANG
Well of course I shall speak to the
Dean, but it will be extremely
difficult.
BERTIE
I should like the Doctor to be
seated in the King’s Box.
COSMO LANG
But members of your Family will be
seated there, Sir.

71
BERTIE
That why it’s suitable.
LIONEL
And now, if you don’t mind, we need
the premises.
COSMO LANG
My dear fellow, this is Westminster
Abbey! The Church must prepare his
Majesty.
LIONEL
My preparations for Bertie are
equally important.
The two men stare each other down.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
With complete privacy. If you don’t
mind.
BERTIE
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
COSMO LANG
(sniffs)
I shall place the Abbey at Your
Majesty’s disposal...this evening.
Your Majesty.
Lang nods curtly and exits.
INT.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT

Footsteps resonate.
Lionel enters. Ahead, he sees Cosmo Lang quietly conferring
with Bertie. As Lionel approached, Cosmo Lang slips away.
LIONEL
I can’t believe I’m walking on
Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright? Let’s get
cracking.
Bertie, seated on a ceremonial chair, does not rise.
BERTIE
I’m not here to rehearse, Doctor
Logue.
PauseBERTIE (CONT’D)
True, you never called yourself
‘Doctor’. I did that for you.

72
BERTIE (CONT’D)
No diploma, no training, no
qualifications. Just a great deal
of nerve.
LIONEL
Ah, the star chamber inquisition,
is it?
BERTIE
You asked for trust and total
equality.
LIONEL
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley, I
was there. I heard you. My son
Laurie said “Do you think you could
help that poor man?” I replied “If
I had the chance”.
BERTIE
What, as a failed actor!?
LIONEL
It’s true, I’m not a doctor, and
yes I acted a bit, recited in pubs
and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, our boys
were pouring back from the front,
shell-shocked and unable to speak
and somebody said, “Lionel, you’re
very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers”. I did
muscle therapy, exercise,
relaxation, but I knew I had to go
deeper. Those poor young blokes had
cried out in fear, and no-one was
listening to them. My job was to
give them faith in their voice and
let them know that a friend was
listening. That must ring a few
bells with you, Bertie.
BERTIE
You give a very noble account of
yourself.
LIONEL
Make inquiries. It’s all true.
BERTIE
Inquiries have been made! You have
no idea who I have breathing down
my neck. I vouched for you and you
have no credentials.

73
LIONEL
But lots of success! I can’t show
you a certificate - there was no
training then. All I know I know by
experience, and that war was some
experience. May plaque says, ‘L.
Logue, Speech Defects’. No Dr., no
letters after my name.
(with mock seriousness)
Lock me in the Tower.
BERTIE
I would if I could!
LIONEL
On what charge?
BERTIE
Fraud! With war looming, you’ve
saddle this nation with a voiceless
King. Destroyed the happiness of my
family...all for the sake of
ensnaring a star patient you knew
you couldn’t possibly assist!
His desperation spills out. He pulls himself out the chair,
striding past Lionel.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
It’ll be like mad King George the
Third, there’ll be Mad King George
the Stammerer, who let his people
down so badly in their hour of
need!
Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
What’re you doing? Get up! You
can’t sit there!
OverlappingLIONEL
Why not? It’s a chair.
BERTIE
No, it’s not, that is Saint
Edward’s ChairLIONEL
People have carved their initials
into it!
BERTIE
That chair is the seat on which
every King and Queen-

74
LIONEL
It’s held in place by a large rock!
BERTIE
That is the Stone of Scone, you are
trivialising everythingLIONEL
I don’t care. I don’t care how many
Royal arses have sat in this chairOverlappingBERTIE
Listen to me... !
LIONEL
Listen to you?! By what right?
BERTIE
Divine right, if you must! I’m your
King!!!
LIONEL
Noooo you’re not! Told me so
yourself. Said you didn’t want it.
So why should I waste my time
listening to you?
BERTIE
Because I have a right to be heard!
LIONEL
Heard as what?!
BERTIE
A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!!
LIONEL
(quietly)
Yes you do. You have such
perseverance, Bertie, you’re the
bravest man I know. And you’ll make
a bloody good king.
Bertie stares at him.
A familiar voice is heard from the shadows.
VOICE
What on earth’s going on, Sir?
BERTIE
It’s all right, Archbishop.
The Archbishop of Canterbury.

75
COSMO LANG
Mr Logue, you should know that I
have found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable
credentials. Hence, your services
will no longer be required.
I’m sorry?

BERTIE

COSMO LANG
Your Majesty’s function is to
consult and be advised. You didn’t
consult, but you’ve just been
advised.
BERTIE
Now I advise you: in this personal
matter I will make my own decision.
COSMO LANG
My concern is for the head upon
which I must place the crown.
BERTIE
I appreciate that Archbishop, but
it’s my head!
COSMO LANG
Your humble servant.
Lang turns on his heel and is gone, leaving Bertie shaken,
with both anger, and fear.
LIONEL
Thank you Bertie. Shall we
rehearse?
Bertie sits in the ceremonial chair once more.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
As soon as you and Elizabeth enter
the West door, you’ll be greeted
with the hymn “I Was Glad When They
Said Unto Me.” You won’t actually
be that glad, because they sing it
for a great long time. Then your
friend the Archbishop will ponce up
and say, “Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take The Oath?” You
say..
BERTIE
“I am willing”.

76
LIONEL
Course you are! I’ll see what it
sounds like from the cheap seats so
even your old nanny can hear.
“Will you govern your peoples of
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according
to their lands and customs?”
BERTIE
"I solemnly promise so do so."
LIONEL
LOUDER! I can’t hear you up the
back.
BERTIE
“I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!”
LIONEL
Very good! "Will you to your power
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to
be executed in all your
judgements?"
BERTIE
"I will." “I WILL!”
LIONEL
Then a long bit about upholding the
faith, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
BERTIE
“These things which I have
herebefore promised, I will perform
and keep. So help me God.”
LIONEL
That’s all you have to say. Four
short responses, kiss the book and
sign the oath. There you are:
you’re King. Easy.
The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard.
INT. SCREENING ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW DAY
On the screen: archive - Pathe newsreel footage of the
Coronation.
The Royal Family watches: Bertie, Elizabeth, Lilibet and
Margaret. Cosmo Lang and his assistant are in attendance.
There is a projectionist also.

77
MARGARET ROSE
You nearly crowned him backwards
Archbishop!
Lang steps in front of the screen, eager to explain
COSMO LANG
Someone had removed the thread that
was marking the front of the Crown,
Sir.
BERTIE
Try not lose the thread,
Archbishop.
LILLIBET
(peering around Lang)
Archbishop, your missing Papa.
We see Bertie giving two of his responses.
ELIZABETH
Very good, very good. Archbishop.
COSMO LANG
Well, I hope Your Majesties are
thrilled with the result.
The Coronation footage finishes. The next segment of the
newsreel is entitled “Hitler in Nuremberg!” and shows him
viewing troops doing the goose-step amidst immense crowds. We
then see Hitler’s mad eloquence, mesmerizing all.
COSMO LANG (CONT’D)
(to the projectionist)
You can turn that off now.
ELIZABETH
No, wait, keeping going.
LILLIBET
Do have a seat, Archbishop.
They watch the footage.
LILIBET
What’s he saying, Papa?
BERTIE
I don’t know, but he seems to be
saying it rather well.
Off the roar of the crowds on the screen.
Bertie’s face as he watches Hitler.

78
INT. MEETING ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW DAY
Baldwin enters, looking pale and tired, to see Bertie.
BERTIE
Good Morning Mr Baldwin.
BALDWIN
Good Morning your Majesty.
Congratulations on your Coronation.
It went splendidly.
BERTIE
Thank you, Prime Minister. Luckily
I only had to repeat a few short
oaths. I may not be so fortunate in
the future.
BALDWIN
Sir, I have asked to see you today
in order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.
BERTIE
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr
Baldwin.
BALDWIN
Neville Chamberlain will take my
place as Prime Minister. It’s a
matter of principal. I was
mistaken. I have found it
impossible to believe that there is
any man in the World so lacking in
moral feeling as Hitler, but the
world might be hurled for a second
time into the abyss of destructive
War. Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler’s intention.
I am only sorry to leave you in
this time of crisis. I am afraid
Sir, your greatest test is yet to
come.
INT. LOGUE’S PARLOUR - DAY
The Logue family are sat around the wireless.
CHAMBERLAIN
I am speaking to you from the
cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.
(MORE)

79
CHAMBERLAIN (CONT'D)
This morning the British Ambassador
in Berlin handed the German
Government a final note stating
that unless we heard from them by
11 o’clock that they were prepared
at once to withdraw their troops
from Poland, a state of war would
exist between us. I have to tell
you now that no such undertaking
has been received, and that
consequently this country is at war
with Germany.
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE, BERTIE’S STUDY - DAY
3rd September 1939. Bertie, in uniform, is at his desk going
through paperwork. HARDINGE, the King’s Private Secretary,
enters briskly.
HARDINGE
At last. Here it is. You are live
at six. I’ve timed it at just under
nine minutes. The wording is fully
approved. The Prime Minister will
be joining you for the broadcast
which will go out live to the
Nation, the Empire and to our Armed
Forces.
BERTIE
Get Logue here immediately.
Hardinge exits. Bertie is left contemplating the speech.
Nervous as hell.
INT. - LOGUE’S CAR - DAY
Laurie drives Logue. Out the window he sees sandbags being
piled round government buildings.
LIONEL
(peering up into the sky)
Look, there are the barrage
balloons. They got them up there
quickly.
An air raid siren is heard.
LAURIE
Should we pull over and find
shelter?

80
LOGUE
No, just go straight on. We’ll be
alright.
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. LOGUE’S CAR, OUTSIDE BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Logue’s ID is checked.
EXT. QUADRANGLE, BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Logue hurries into the Palace. The car pulls away.
INT. COATROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Logue hangs up umbrella, coat and gas mask.
INT. STAIRCASE, BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Logue is met on the stairs by Hardinge who hands him a
speech.
HARDINGE
The King’s Speech. We have about
forty minutes until the broadcast.
Lionel hurries up the stairs.
INT.

BERTIE’S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

Bertie (dressed in his naval uniform) and Logue (dressed in
black tie) are rehearsing.
BERTIE
(stammering very badly)
“There may be dark days ahead, and
w-w-wa...”
Try again.

LIONEL

BERTIE
“There may be dark days ahead, and
w-... ”
LIONEL
Turn the hesitations into pauses,
and say to yourself, “God save the
King”.

81
BERTIE
I say that continually, but
apparently no one’s listening.
LIONEL
Long pauses are good: they add
solemnity to great occasions.
BERTIE
Then I’m the solemnest king who
ever lived. Lionel, I can’t do
this!
LIONEL
Bertie, you can do this!
BERTIE
If I am to be King...where is my
power? May I form a Government,
levy a tax or declare a war? No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why? Because the Nation believes
when I speak, I speak for them. Yet
I cannot speak!
As though none of this had happened:
LIONEL
Let’s take it from the top. “In
this grave hour...”
BERTIE
(hesitates, then)
“In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck
perhaps the most fateful in our
history bugger shit shit (singing)
I send to every household of my p-pThe letter‘P’ is always difficult.
LIONEL
Bounce onto it ‘a-peoples both at
home and’
BERTIE
“a-peoples both at home and
overseas,...”
Beaut.

LIONEL

BERTIE
(singing)
“... this message, doo-dah, doodah....spoken with the same depth
of feeling...for each one of you as
if I were to fuck shit bugger cross
your threshold and speak to you mmy - ...”

82
LIONEL
In your head, now: “I have a right
to be bloody well heard!”
BERTIE
Bloody well heard, bloody well
heard, bloody well heard myself!
LIONEL
Now Waltz. Move! Get continuous
movement.
BERTIE
(waltzing and singing)
“For the second time in the lives
of most of us we are at wa - ...”
Bertie jams and comes to a halt.
LIONEL
Pause. “we are...” Take a pause.
BERTIE
I can’t do this.
LIONEL
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look
at the last paragraph.
ELIZABETH
Bertie...it’s time.
Bertie and Lionel glance at each other.
Bertie approaches the door.
He pauses.
Down a long perspective of rooms we see ahead the waiting
microphone.
Like a tunnel. Like Wembley.
Bertie begins the long walk, flanked by his wife and his
speech specialist.
INT. STATE ROOMS, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
Bertie, Lionel, and Elizabeth walk towards the microphone.
A corgi barks as they approach.
The first room has a large speaker and chairs arranged for
listening to the broadcast. Lang, Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain and Churchill are in attendance.

83
BERTIE
Prime Minister. Nice to see you
again, so soon. Good of you to be
here, I’m sure you’ve had rather a
busy day.
CHAMBERLAIN
Let’s hope we have no more
interruptions from those damned
sirens, Sir.
BERTIE
Or the wretched dogs.
(to Churchill)
Congratulations. First Lord of the
Admiralty.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Your Majesty.
BERTIE
(nodding towards the
recording room)
The long walk.
Churchill detaches himself from Lang and walks with Bertie.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Good luck, Sir. I too dread
this...apparatus. Had a speech
impediment myself, you know.
I didn’t.

BERTIE

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Family secret. Tongue-tied. An
operation was considered too
dangerous. I eventually made an
asset of it.
A moment of silent recognition between the two men.
BERTIE
Thank you, Mr Churchill.
Churchill nods, then goes to his seat, as Bertie passes into
the next room.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
How long, Logue?
LIONEL
Just under three minutes, Sir.
Ahead is the microphone set up on a grand desk in a
beautifully ornate state room.

84
Next to it is now revealed a stills camera and lights - all
set for a photo op.
Bertie, Logue and Elizabeth, ignoring it, pass right by, turn
a corner and we now see a perspective of much smaller rooms
leading to a microphone framed in a doorway, hung at head
height. A tumble of cables stretch through the rooms.
We pass through two rooms of audio equipment with eight
technicians all wearing black tie, all set for the broadcast.
Bertie’s tension builds.
At the door to the broadcasting booth he is met by the BBC’s
Wood.
Bertie greets him
Mr Wood.

BERTIE

WOOD
Good luck, Your Majesty.
Logue, Bertie and Elizabeth enter the booth.
INT. BROADCASTING BOOTH - DAY
The dreaded BBC microphone, in a surprisingly small room. It
is arranged so Bertie can stand up as he speaks, the way
Logue likes it. The ceiling has been lowered and it has been
decorated in cheerful colours. As a podium for the speech an
old school desk has been propped up on wooden blocks so it’s
the right height for Bertie.
Logue immediately opens the window to get the air
circulating.
Bertie says nothing, but goes up and inspects the looming
microphone.
He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus
with the little finger, thumb to chin.
BERTIE
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve
of sifted thistles and a sieve on
unsifted thistles..
ELIZABETH
Bertie, darling, make sure it’s not
switched on!

85
LIONEL
Remember the red light will blink
three times and then I’ve asked
them to turn it off, because we
don’t want that evil eye staring at
you all the way through.
ELIZABETH
I am sure you will be splendid.
WOOD
One minute, sir.
Elizabeth steps back with a wonderful smile as Wood closes
the door, sealing Bertie and Logue in the booth.
BERTIE
No matter how this turns out, I
don’t know how to thank you for
what you’ve done.
LIONEL
Knighthood?
They smile.
WOOD (O.S.)
Twenty seconds.
LIONEL
Forget everything else and just say
it to me. Say it to me, as a
friend.
The red light in the booth flashes.
The red light flashes for the second time.
Bertie concentrates.
The red light flashes for the third time.
The red light now goes steady red.
Lionel opens his arms wide and mouths, “Breathe!”.
On Air.
Bertie’s hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle
like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the Adam’s
apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
reappear.
Several seconds have elapsed. It seems an eternity.

86
INT. CONTROL ROOM, BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE - DAY
The technicians in their suits, ties and scientific looking
white overcoats, wearing bulky headphones, monitoring
daunting banks of valves and dials listen with growing
apprehension to the silence broken only by crackling static.
INT. KING’S STUDY/BROADCAST ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
The tension is more than palpable.
Bertie and Logue stare at each other.
Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man
he’s worked with. His confidence is contagious.
Bertie takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly. His throat
muscles relax, his hands steady - all the things he’s
practiced.
BERTIE
In this grave hour, perhaps the
most fateful in our history, I send
to every household of my peoples,
both at home and overseas this
message spoken with the same depth
of feeling for each one of you as
if I were able to cross your
threshold and speak to you myself.
His cadence is slow and measured, not flawless, but he does
not stop.
INT - STATE ROOMS - DAY
In the listening room:
Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair and then slowly
relaxes as Bertie’s calm, measure voice comes over the
speakers.
INT./EXT. MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS
The assembled dignitaries at Buckingham Palace, Myrtle with
two of the boys, people listening to radios in homes, pubs,
factories. A group of soldiers, including Antony Logue. Queen
Mary sitting in her State Apartments, David and Wallis
listening dolefully in a villa in the South of France, the
crowds assembled outside Buckingham Palace, listening on loud
speakers. Cutting continually back to Bertie as he grows in
confidence
BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)
For the second time in the lives of
most of us we are at war.
(MORE)

87
BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
Over and over again we have tried
to find a peaceful way out of the
differences between ourselves and
those who are now our enemies. But
it has been in vain. We have been
forced into a conflict. For we are
called, with our allies, to meet
the challenge of a principle which,
if it were to prevail, would be
fatal to any civilized order in the
world. Such a principle, stripped
of all disguise, is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is
right. For the sake of all that we
ourselves hold dear, and of the
world’s order and peace, it is
unthinkable that we should refuse
to meet the challenge. It is to
this high purpose that I now call
my people at home and my peoples
across the seas, who will make our
cause their own. I ask them to
stand calm and firm, and united in
this time of trial. The task will
be hard. There may be dark days
ahead, and war can no longer be
confined to the battlefield. But we
can only do the right as we see the
right and reverently commit our
cause to God.
INT.

BROADCASTING BOOTH, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS

Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly
magnificent. Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes:
BERTIE (CONT’D)
If one and all we keep resolutely
faithful to it, then, with God’s
help, we shall prevail.

That was very good, Bertie.
Lionel closes the window.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
You still stammered on the “w”.
BERTIE
Had to throw in a few so they knew
it was me.
Wood opens the door.
WOOD
Congratulations, your Majesty. A
true broadcaster.
BERTIE
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Bertie and Lionel pass out of the booth to the sounds of
applause.
They pause at the desk, which is set up with a microphone.
Bertie sits and has his official photograph taken.
LIONEL
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
BERTIE
Expect I shall have to do a great
deal more. Thank you, Logue.
Bertie stands and takes Lionel’s hand
BERTIE (CONT’D)
Thank you. My friend.
LIONEL
Thank you... Your Majesty.
INT. STATE ROOMS, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
Bertie heads towards the listening room.
Elizabeth goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the

Onwards?

BERTIE

Bertie continues on, and is greeted by Lang, Churchill and
Chamberlain.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Couldn’t have said it better
myself, Sir
The ultimate Churchillian compliment.

Lang next.

COSMO LANG
Your Majesty, I’m speechless.
CHAMBERLAIN
Congratulations, Sir
BERTIE
Thank you, Gentlemen.
Bertie sweeps Lillibet into his arms.
BERTIE (CONT’D)
So how was Papa?
LILLIBET
Halting at first, but you got much
better Papa.
He kisses her.
BERTIE
Bless you.
(picking Margaret up)
And how about you?
MARGARET
You were just splendid, Papa.
BERTIE
Of course I was.
Bertie readies himself to step out on to the balcony; waiting
crowds are glimpsed through the windows.
Across the room, Bertie’s eyes meet Logue’s. A brief nod. A
moment of recognition.

EXT. BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
The King, his Queen and their children wave to the crowds,
receiving their adulation and love.
Bertie glances upwards.
POV - silver dirigibles hover protectively.
ON THE BALCONY - Bertie and Elizabeth, King and Queen, wave
to their people and receive their approbation.
Lionel watches from the shadow.
CARD:
King George VI made Lionel Logue a Commander of the Royal
Victorian Order in 1944.
This high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of the
only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of
personal service to the Monarch.
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.
Through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national
resistance.
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their
lives.
