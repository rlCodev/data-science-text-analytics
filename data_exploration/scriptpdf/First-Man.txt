OVER BLACK:
STATIC. And then faint, choppy MILITARY COMMS. Playback from
an old reel-to-reel. Slowly we realize... it’s in Russian.
A VOICE begins to translate...
GAGARIN (ON TAPE, RUSSIAN)
Slow rotation, stage cutoff.
Calculated orbit achieved.

ENGLISH TRANSLATOR
Slow rotation, stage cutoff.
Calculated orbit achieved.

CREDITS OVER BLACK. Small font, the corner of the screen.
But our focus remains on what we’re HEARING. [NOTE: This
scene is played entirely over black as credits roll]
GAGARIN (ON TAPE, RUSSIAN)
A sense of weightlessness...
I see, I am over America.

ENGLISH TRANSLATOR
A sense of weightlessness, I
see, I... I am over America.

MURMURS. A reaction. Then a CLICK; the Comms go silent. As
credits continue, we hear papers SHUFFLING; chairs CREAKING.
VOICE #1 (SORENSON)
Jack needs a public response.
This voice is a bit clearer. But only a bit. It still feels
like LO-FI TAPE of a meeting. An important meeting.
VOICE #2 (LOW)
Shepard’s scheduled... in 2 weeks.
SORENSON
Gagarin orbited three times, a
suborbital flight’s not a response.
VOICE #3 (WEISNER)
(hard to hear)
Why not... something... clearer longterm benefit. Desalinization-SORENSON
Salt water’s not gonna sell, Jerry.
(then)
Is there no way our current program
can compete with the Soviets?
VOICE #4 (GILRUTH)
Not our current program. The
Soviets are too far ahead.
We feel the room turn to this new voice. Quiet.
We don’t know it yet, but this is BOB GILRUTH.

Commanding.

2.
GILRUTH
The only way to win is to pick a
mission so far off, requiring so
many new scientific developments
that we could be first to get there.
SORENSON
You have something in mind?
We hear paper shuffling.

A report DROPPED on a table.

GILRUTH
It’s... speculative.
A beat.

More paper SHUFFLING.
SORENSON
How much will this --

LOW
Thirty five, maybe forty.

WEISNER
Forty million doll...

GILRUTH
Billion. Forty billion dollars.
WEISNER
Jesus Christ.
We hear a door open.

A whisper.

SORENSON
Jack’s ready for us.
The sound of chairs PUSHED BACK.

Men SHUFFLING out.

Then...

SORENSON
Bob, hold up...
(sotto)
He won’t like the price tag but if I
can sell it, where would we start?
Well.

GILRUTH
We’re gonna need more men.

THE CREDITS END.

A moment of SILENCE OVER BLACK.

Then we hear it.

A low RUMBLE.

It grows LOUDER... then LOUDER STILL. A screaming ENGINE.
And HOWLING WIND. BURSTS of STATIC. Faint COMMS.
It SURROUNDS us, filling us with dread, POUNDING US INTO --

3.
INT. X-15 COCKPIT, HIGH RANGE, ABOVE EDWARDS AFB - DAY
A pair of BLUE EYES. TICKING back and forth. Rapidly. We’re
knocked out by this FIRST IMAGE, by the eyes, oblivious to the
RAW and FRIGHTENING WALL OF SOUND all around us.
JOE (COMMS)
Data check?

NEIL (O.C.)
2 APU on. Cabin pressure is
good, 3500 on #1, 3355 on #2.
Platform internal power.

PULL BACK TO FIND NEIL ARMSTRONG, 31, in a silver pressure suit
and helmet. Neil is INTENSE and INTENSELY FOCUSED, impressive
given the SEVERE TURBULENCE that bangs him around the cockpit.
JOE (COMMS)
What’s your mixing chambers?
BUTCH (COMMS)
Two minute point.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
-44 and -45.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
MH circuit breakers on...

Neil flips a switch on the low tech console. He glances up
from the analogue dials and out the cockpit window... and if
the plane looks like a ROCKET, it’s ‘cause it is.
This is the X-15. And as we're about to see, it's the FASTEST
FUCKING AIRCRAFT EVER MADE.
But just now, it isn't flying... or rather, not flying alone.
Neil’s X-15 is attached to the wing of a B-52 -- BALLS 8, a
four engine BEHEMOTH that’s shaking even more than the X-15.
It’s more than a bit terrifying, but Neil calmly hits another
switch as he’s KNOCKED across the cockpit.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Protocol is off. Little bumpy.
It’s classic Armstrong understatement; underscored as we see
the B-52 pilot (BUTCH) TOSSED against the window of his plane.
BUTCH (COMMS)
Worst it's ever been, real rough up
here, fluctuating a half degree each
side.
This just drives Neil into deeper focus.

4.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Velocity 900 fps, altitude
44,500, pitch attitude level.
No reply.

JOE (COMMS)
Copy. Neil, we're reading
your heart rate at 145.

Neil’s eyes TICK METHODICALLY from gauge to gauge.
JOE (COMMS)
Neil, we’re reading your heart rate
at 145, do you copy?
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Copy Joe. Igniter ready to light.

Neil’s not gonna engage. Whatever adrenaline spike his body
is experiencing, Neil’s determined to remain detached.
A beat. We can almost hear JOE WALKER, on the other end of
the comms, debating whether to abort. At last, he relents.
JOE (COMMS)
Okay. Arm switch lite
checks.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Going to prime. Ammonia up.

In the bumpy cockpit, Neil springs back into action.
BUTCH (COMMS)
Twenty seconds to drop --

NEIL (COMMS)
Rog, precool on, lox pump
bearing plus eight.

BUTCH (COMMS) (CONT’D)
Ten seconds --

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Igniter idle, ready to launch
on 3, 2, 1, release...

Suddenly the X-15 is RELEASED from the wing of the B-52.
Through the cockpit window, we see the B-52 RISE SHARPLY as
the X-15 DROPS IN FREE FALL...
A FREE FALL we feel in our gut because WE’RE NOT CUTTING AWAY.
And if you haven’t figured it out by now, WE’RE GONNA BE IN
THE COCKPIT WITH NEIL FOR THIS ENTIRE HEART-POUNDING RIDE.
So. We’re DROPPING. FAST. Neil PUNCHES the igniter... the
rocket LIGHTS and WE HEAR THE ROAR OF 57,000 POUNDS OF THRUST.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
And I got a good lite and aw...
The words are literally left behind and Neil’s THROWN back
into his seat as the rocket TAKES OFF at a VIOLENT RATE. Neil
FIGHTS OFF 6 G’s, reaching for the stick.
Roll.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)

5.
He tilts the stick slightly and the plane BUCKS TO THE RIGHT,
TOSSING Neil like a RAG DOLL and TAKING OUR BREATH AWAY.
JOE (FAINT, COMMS)
Good on track, 15 seconds.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Pulling up, I’m indicating
Mach 3.

Neil pulls on the stick and RISES SHARPLY towards the heavens.
He’s PRESSED into his seat and we see the plane’s blue nickel
nose, glowing CHERRY RED from the heat. Sweet Jesus.
JOE (FAINTER, COMMS)
Seem to be a tad steep.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Okay, I’m...

Neil’s eyes TICK to the altitude gauge, SPINNING UP past
150,000 feet. He makes an adjustment as the X-15 PUSHES
THROUGH THE HORIZON, BLUE SKY NOW TURNING TO BLACK...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m indicating 5,800, pushing over.
Yes, that's Mach 5.8, almost 4,000 mph, and we feel every bit
of it... ‘til we pass 170,000 feet and Neil CUTS THE ENGINE...
...JOLTING him against his harness... and INTO MICROGRAVITY.
For a moment all is STILL. Quiet. We hear a BUZZ over the
radio, but it's GARBLED. Far away.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
190,000 feet, no radio reception,
setting instruments to record high
altitude flight response.
Neil punches a few buttons as A LOGBOOK FLOATS PAST HIM...
because WE’RE SUBORBITAL, high as the first Mercury flights.
So yeah, things float. Oh, and the view is pretty good too...
Neil looks out, takes in the earth stretching, curving away
below the BLACK SKY. The STARS. The MOON.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
207,000 feet. Top view, looking
out, can see an awful long ways.
Everything is quiet save for the low purr of the APUs. Neil
turns his attention to the G-LIMITER GAUGE as the X-15 slowly
falls back to earth, the altitude gauge starting to spin...
The plane SHAKES, but Neil stays focused on the G-limiter,
creeping towards 2.5 G's. Which is when we hear it...

6.
An ODD SOUND. A MECHANICAL WHINE. It seems out of place.
Neil ignores it as gravity takes hold, PRESSING him forward
against his seat straps. We hear GARBLED BUZZ over comms.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Still no radio. 150,000 feet,
little shake in the yaw.
Again, Armstrong understatement... the plane SHAKES VIOLENTLY
as the altitude gauge spins down past 120,000, the BLACK SKY
FADING BACK TO BLUE as we fall back into the atmosphere.
JOE (FAINT, COMMS)
Okay, brakes out, check the RCS off.
WIND WHIPS over the plane. Neil reduces his angle of attack,
still focused on the G-Limiter, still ignoring that ODD WHINE.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
RCS off, brakes are out, GLimiter not quite at 5 G’s.

JOE (COMMS)
Okay, 25° stabilizer, hard
left turn.

Neil pulls on the stick, eyes FIXED on the G-limiter, FAILING
TO NOTICE the plane isn’t turning... that the altitude gauge
is HOLDING at 115,000 FEET. Slowly, it begins to CLIMB...
116, 117, 118... THE SKY TURNS FROM BLUE TO A CHILLING BLACK.
The shaking STOPS, the whipping wind FADES to EERIE SILENCE.
JOE (COMMS)
We show you ballooning, not turning.
The comms are drowned out by the ODD WHINE. Neil, FIXATED on
the G-limiter, doesn’t see the altitude gauge FLIPPING UP...
JOE (COMMS)
Lot more left there.

Neil!

Joe’s voice cuts through the whine, which FADES. Neil BLINKS,
noticing how QUIET it is... the plane has stopped shaking.
Neil’s eyes TICK from the black sky to the altitude gauge...
120, 121, 122... SHIT. He realizes he’s fucked up.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Rog, I’m reading --

JOE (COMMS)
You're bouncing off the
atmosphere, hard left!

Neil YANKS on the stick, eyes DARTING from the dynamic
pressure gauge to the vista sailing by below.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Aerodynamic controls not responding.

7.
Unlike Joe, Neil remains calm... but as we PUSH IN ON HIS EYES
ticking from gauge to gauge, we see the INTENSITY, the FOCUS.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Switching over to reaction controls.
Neil drops the stick, grabs the ballistic controls. We hear a
HISS as a BURST of peroxide gas SHOOTS OUT from the nose of
the plane and Neil's TOSSED BACK in his seat...
...the plane’s nose FLYING UP TOWARDS THE SKY, the horizon now
ABOVE Neil’s head; the black sky, the stars, BELOW his feet.
And we realize... NEIL'S FLIPPED THE X-15 ON ITS BACK, THE
NOSE IS STICKING STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR! HOLY SHIT!!!
The canopy view is crazy, mountains above, sky below, the
world upside down, but Neil keeps his eyes on the ALTITUDE
GAUGE, inching up. 123, 124... then HOLDING at 125,000 FEET.
A beat... then it begins to DROP.

123, 120, 115, 105...

The sky once again FADES TO BLUE and we hear a SLIGHT WIND
under the plane. Neil's eyes TICK from the altitude gauge to
the dynamic pressure gauge...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Surface pressure rising, switch over
to aerodynamic controls.
Neil reaches for the stick... but the atmosphere GRABS THE
PLANE, PULLING IT DOWN ON ITS BACK! FUCK! Neil STRAINS to
hold on as he's THROWN around the cockpit with 9 G'S OF FORCE!
The altitude gauge SPINS down at TERRIFYING SPEED. 95, 90,
85... Shit. Neil STRUGGLES, WRESTLING with the stick... until
he manages to FLIP the lifeless plane RIGHT-SIDE UP. Jesus.
As Neil points the plane towards Edwards, the RADIO SQUAWKS -JOE (COMMS)
Neil, can you give us a visual
estimate of your location?
Neil scans the landscape, searching for the desert runway as
the plane DIVES LIKE A BRICK towards the mountains...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Looks like I’m pretty... in pretty
bad shape for the south lake bed.
JOE (COMMS)
Okay, working the contingencies for
a landing from the south.

8.
Neil’s eyes TICK over the horizon, but he knows what’s coming-JOE (COMMS)
Neil, there is no contingency.
need to get back to Rogers.

You

Neil BEARS DOWN, trying to GLIDE the engine-less plane farther
than ever. Yes, the X-15 was BUILT to land without power...
but generally, a pilot had A LOT more altitude to work with.
The plane SHIMMIES back and forth, wind HOWLING at 300 knots.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I can see the base, runway 35, it’ll
have to be a straight in approach.
His eyes DART from the distant desert landing strip to the
altitude gauge, dropping 20,000 feet per minute. Neil FLIPS
his head bumper... and SMOKE POURS from the instrument panel.
JOE (COMMS)
Can we get a visual estimate?
The cockpit is FILLED with smoke...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
...pretty hard to tell from here...
Neil hits a button. WHOOSH! The plane dumps peroxide and the
smoke clears the cabin, but the view is HARDLY A RELIEF...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m a little shorter than I thought.
Neil pulls the stick to hold altitude, but he keeps DROPPING.
9,000... 8500... 8000 feet... Fuck. It's going to be close.
We see Butch’s B-52 SWING UP on Neil’s right.
BUTCH (COMMS)
Your ventral is still on!
Neil REACTS, ANNOYED at himself. He HITS the ventral button.
The ventral fin BLOWS OFF and the plane PITCHES forward...
Neil STRUGGLES with the stick... 4,000, 3,500, 3,000 feet...
BUTCH (COMMS)
Start your flaps down now!
Neil PUNCHES the flaps. The plane BUCKS UP, reaching towards
the runway... and now the ODD MECHANICAL WHINE returns.

9.
PUSH IN on Neil, INTENSITY BURNING as the whine CRESCENDOS...
2,000, 1,000, 500 feet... the plane HURTLES past the edge of
the brush, JUST CLEARING THE JOSHUA TREES!!!
BUTCH (COMMS)
You’re in! Go head and put her down!
Neil PULLS UP HARD, flaring the plane, nose up, skids down...
The plane SLAMS DOWN with a BANG. It SKIDS ROUGHLY across the
desert... SHAKING VIOLENTLY... And just as we think it might
BREAK into a million pieces, Neil HITS the back fin brakes...
The plane goes into a CONTROLLED SLIDE... kicking up a HUGE
CLOUD of dust... and TOSSING NEIL ACROSS THE COCKPIT... until
at last, the plane eases to a HALT.
For a moment, all is STILL. Silent.
forward and takes his helmet off.

Then Neil STIRS... leans

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m down.
BUTCH (COMMS)
Son of a bitch!

JOE (COMMS)
(clearly relieved)
Very nice, Neil. Posse will
get there shortly.

As the dust clears and Neil looks out towards the fire trucks
in the distance rolling towards him, we CUT TO -EXT. LANDING STRIP 35, ROGERS DRY LAKE BED, EAFB - LATER
An Air Force jeep WIPES FRAME... REVEALING EDWARDS AFB FIRE
TRUCKS, NASA PICK UPS and TECHS surrounding Neil’s X-15. The
period cars are cool, but our eye is drawn to the X-15.
It’s our first real look at the hypersonic rocket plane. The
long fuselage, the thick dorsal wedge fin, the NASA signage...
It's every bit as awesome as the flight we just witnessed.
PUSH IN on THE OPEN COCKPIT. NASA Engineers take readings off
the instrument panel while Neil makes notes in his logbook. A
beat, then Neil finishes up and climbs out of the cockpit.
BUTCH
Think you set a couple records.
A FAMILIAR VOICE. ‘Butch’ Butchart, 30s, flight gear, walks
up with Neil’s boss, Joe Walker, 40, thoughtful. Butch GRINS.
Neil nods stiffly as a TECH with a MAP calls out.

10.
TECH
Butch, you mind walking me through
the release data?
Butch heads off.

Joe turns to Neil.

JOE
You okay?
NEIL
Uh huh. I don’t think anyone’s
experienced that kind of atmosphere
bounce, we should try to replicate
it in the sim -Neil.
Yeah?

JOE
NEIL

Joe looks at him, concerned. But Neil’s not going there. A
FLIGHT SURGEON who’s been waiting by the plane intercedes.
FLIGHT SURGEON
Hey Joe, I gotta do his work up.
Joe nods. Neil follows the surgeon off. Joe turns back to
his jeep, only to find a grizzled AIR FORCE COLONEL, late 30s.
COLONEL YEAGER (O.C.)
Kid’s a good engineer, but he’s not
too good an airplane driver.
Bouncing up in the thin air where
you can’t turn, it’s not too bright.
JOE
He was focused on the G-limiter.
was a core flight objective.
But it’s not clear Joe believes that.
GLINTS in the sun. C. YEAGER.

It

The Colonel’s tag

COLONEL YEAGER
Three mishaps in three months. It’s
not my call, but I’d ground him.
Yeager heads out. As we HOLD ON Joe, wondering if Yeager’s
right, we hear it again... that ODD MECHANICAL WHINE... the
same unnerving sound Neil heard in the X-15. It takes us to -INT. ROOM, DANIEL FREEMAN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
CLOSE ON a 2-year-old girl (KAREN).

Quiet, self-contained.

11.
PULL BACK to see a COBALT RADIATION MACHINE HULKING over her.
The source of the now familiar WHINE, it beams GAMMA RAYS into
her brain as she lies on a gurney.
HOLD for an AWFUL BEAT... then REVERSE TO the OBSERVATION
WINDOW. Neil and his wife, JANET, 27. Watching.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
Janet BLINKS back tears, reaches for Neil...
He takes her hand, but he’s focused on the nearby INSTRUMENT
PANEL... his ever alert eyes TICKING across the console as a
TECH adjusts RADIATION LEVELS, sets the dials... 1.17. 1.33.
Neil slips his hand out of Janet’s, pulls out a LOGBOOK to jot
down the numbers... all while trying to block out that SOUND.
HOLD ON Neil as the WHINE CRESCENDOES.

Relentless.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, ARMSTRONG CABIN - NIGHT
QUIET. Janet on the floor outside Karen's bedroom, her son,
RICK, 4, asleep in her lap. In SOFT B/G, Neil SINGS softly to
Karen, then kisses her forehead...
HOLD ON Janet trying to keep it together as Neil walks out.
NEIL
I’ll put him down.
Janet nods. Exhausted. Neil tousles her hair then gathers
Rick in his arms. As he carries Rick off, CUT TO-INT. RICK’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Neil tucks Rick in, METHODICALLY straightens the sheets. He
spots a mess of an unfinished model plane on the desk. Neil
COMPULSIVELY moves to tidy it up... then pauses. And SITS...
...in the half light, he glues on a wing and gently blows it
dry. The precision is calming. He’d keep at it, but the
doorbell RINGS. Reluctantly, Neil stands and we CUT TO -INT. FOYER/KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG CABIN - MOMENTS LATER
Neil leads Joe Walker in.

Joe carries in a casserole.

NEIL
Can I offer you a beer?
Sure.

JOE

12.
NEIL
(off the casserole)
That wasn’t necessary.
JOE
Can’t imagine Janet’s been up to
much cooking.
No.

Neil hands Joe a beer.

They drink.

JOE
How’s Karen?
NEIL
She’s doing fine.
Neil doesn't want to talk about it.

An awkward beat.

Then --

JOE
Dick Day called from Houston, Bob
Gilruth was asking after you.
NEIL
For Gemini?
Joe nods. Neil’s eyes TICK to the NASA X-Press newsletter in
a pile of mail on the table. NASA To Select More Astronauts.
JOE
I told them it’s probably not the
right time.
NEIL
Gemini and Apollo are speculative.
We’re up as high as the Mercury
flights, not sure why I’d leave now.
Joe clocks the emotional DENIAL, but doesn’t comment on it.
JOE
Well. It’ll be nice to keep you
around.
INT. BASEMENT OFFICE, ARMSTRONG CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT
A small space. A desk, some shelves. A light CLICKS ON.
Neil walks down the stairs, over to the desk. He sits.
We now see neatly stacked MEDICAL BOOKS, mimeographed copies
of scientific RESEARCH PAPERS. All marked and tabbed.
Neil opens a LARGE COMPUTATIONAL NOTEBOOK filled with TIDY
NOTES. He writes Cobalt Session No.2... then pulls out his
logbook. He transfers the radiation levels. 1.17. 1.33.

13.
A beat. He adds a new heading. Side Effects. Neil pauses.
Then... Fatigue. Dizziness. Extreme headache. Vomiting
(repeated). Hair loss/Scalp irritation. Loss of appetite.
Neil stops writing. He scans the list, then grabs a stack of
papers on COBALT THERAPY and TUCKS them into a MANILA FOLDER
that he places on a shelf. Beside a DOZEN other folders.
Neil takes a breath, then reaches for a dog-eared research
paper from Johns Hopkins. Pre-Adolescent Glioma of the Pons:
Experimental Treatments & Therapies. It’s WELL-MARKED.
Neil's clearly read it a hundred times. Yet he picks up a
high-lighter and starts to read. Again. DETERMINED.
Off Neil, we PRELAP the chilling sound of a MECHANICAL CRANK -EXT. JOSHUA MEMORIAL PARK - LANCASTER, CA - DAY
CLOSE ON a CRANK.

Turning.

Lowering a small coffin.

TIGHT ON Neil with Janet and their son, Rick. All in black.
Janet and Rick cry as KAREN’S COFFIN sinks. Neil does not.
He’s impassive... but he HUGS his family CLOSE. TIGHT.
The SOUND of the crank takes us to -INT. LIVING ROOM, ARMSTRONG CABIN - DAY
A LONG PUSH IN over trays of food. Dark suits and dresses.
Quiet murmurs. No laughter or smiles, no pleasant small talk.
There is no pain like the loss of a child.
We pass Joe and his wife, huddled with Janet. Neil’s by the
window nearby. Watching Rick toss a ball in the yard...
BARELY ENDURING the condolences, the soft pats on the back.
Just when it looks like Neil might break, he SLIPS AWAY.
Winding through the crowd. Towards the basement door.
INT. BASEMENT OFFICE, ARMSTRONG CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT
The desk now a MESS. Marked up medical books and scattered
papers. Neil's notebook, now FILLED, lies open.
We hear the door. Neil walks down the stairs, moves to the
desk. His eyes TICK over books... papers... the notebook.
A beat, then Neil closes the NOTEBOOK... slowly pulls together
the PAPERS and the BOOKS...
...and, up on a high shelf, carefully STACKS THEM ALL AWAY.

14.
Neil’s eyes TICK over the EMPTY DESK. Then he turns off the
light. And exits. We HOLD on the shelf, then CUT TO -INT. BEDROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
CLOSE ON a WESTCLOX ELECTRIC ALARM CLOCK, hour hand near six.
A beat, then we PAN over to Neil. Staring up at the ceiling.
Wide awake. The alarm TRILLS. Neil turns it off as Janet
stirs. Groggy, she rolls over, reaching for him.
Neil?

JANET
But he's already gone.

Off Janet, ALONE...

INT. TEST PILOT OFFICE, NASA FRC, EDWARDS AFB - EARLY MORNING
Joe, Butch and another pilot enter, coats and coffee. Jawing,
laughing... until they spot Neil. Working at his desk.
The men PAUSE, AWKWARD.

SURPRISED to see him.

BUTCH (CONT’D)
Hey, Neil.

Neil.

PILOT

NEIL
Hey. Butch, you have time to talk
through the data on the bounce?
BUTCH
...sure, yeah, of course.
just put my things down.

Lemme

Butch and the other pilot head to their desks.

Joe leans in.

JOE
You can take a few days, you know.
I know.

NEIL
Joe sees he’s not going anywhere, starts to head off when -BUTCH
You gotta be kidding me.
Butch clutches a XEROXED MEMO. He holds it up. A DIAGRAM of
a strange, spider-like contraption, a cockpit on top.
BUTCH
They want a free flying trainer to
simulate a moon landing... how the
hell are we gonna do that?

15.
JOE
I think that’s the question.
BUTCH
They haven’t even figured out how to
get to the moon. I’m not wasting
time on impossible problems.
Butch tosses the memo, exits. As Joe goes after him, Neil
GLANCES at the memo, contemplating the challenge. His eyes
TICK over the DIAGRAM, curious, absorbed... alive.
A beat, then Neil REACHES for the memo and we SMASH TO -INT. EXAM ROOM ONE, ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE, HOUSTON, TX - DAY
CLOSE ON a SYRINGE pumping water into a MAN'S EAR.
Astronaut Selection, Project Gemini
August 13, 1962
The syringe empties. A TECH dips it in a bucket of ICE WATER,
refills it and turns back to... Neil. In his underwear.
TECH
Tell us when you want to stop.
Neil eyes a SECOND TECH with a stopwatch as the WHOOSH of ice
water in his ear propels us into a SERIES OF SHORT SCENES -ISOLATION ROOM
Two TECHS walk Neil into the empty, windowless room.
TECH
Come out after two hours.
They leave and close the door.
PITCH BLACK. Silent. A beat.

The lights flick off. It's
Then we hear Neil hum.

NEIL
Three hundred and sixty men in a
boarding house bed, roll over, roll

man said, roll over, roll over...
INTERVIEW ROOM
A STACK of 'TESTS' is dropped on a desk in front of Neil. He
eyes the first test. For each of the paired statements below,
select the statement that best fits your personality.
Neil digs in: (1) I worry a lot about things in the future
that could go wrong; (2) It takes a lot for me to get angry.

A beat.

Neil circles NUMBER TWO and moves on...

EXAM ROOM TWO
A foot PLUNGES into an ICE BATH.
TECH
Take it out when it’s too cold.
A tech starts a stopwatch, watches Neil.

Who settles in.

We see nothing, hear nothing... but Neil.
NEIL
Two hundred three men in a boarding

More ice water shoots into Neil's ear. The tech nearby
glances at his stopwatch. Neil’s jaw sets.

A last pair: (1) I like to help friends when they’re in
trouble; (2) I like to do my best in whatever I undertake.
Neil reads, thinks and circles NUMBER TWO.

WHOOSH... The tech unloads another syringe into Neil's ear.
PUSH IN on Neil, blank, NUMB. And as we go TIGHT ON HIS EYES,
we see it again. The pain there. The deep, deep PAIN.

The last man thought it'd be a great
joke, to keep on rolling when...

blinks, then walks out. He follows a tech down the hall...
but we HOLD ON a MAN in a tie and shirtsleeves.
Meet DEKE SLAYTON, 37, slightly gray, MACHO back when that was
appealing. Deke turns to the tech with the stopwatch.
DEKE SLAYTON
How long?
The tech shows Deke the watch.

2:03.

INT. HALLWAY, OFFICE BUILDING, ELLINGTON AFB - LATER
The hall lined with chairs, candidates reading PROJECT GEMINI
briefing books. FIND Neil looking for a seat... when PETE
CONRAD, 32, a wicked witted wasp from Princeton calls out.
PETE CONRAD
Air Force? Navy? ...Leatherneck?
Neil looks at him, BLANK.
ED WHITE
Christ, another egghead.

18.
Pete SMIRKS, trades a look with ED WHITE, 32, a lanky Texan
with easy-going charm. But Neil doesn’t engage. Instead, he
heads to the end of the hall, finds a seat and opens a packet.
ELLIOT SEE
Civilian?
Neil glances at ELLIOT SEE, 35, a flight test engineer from
UCLA, older than the rest. And more cerebral. Neil nods.
Me too.

ELLIOT SEE
Elliot See.

NEIL
Neil Armstrong.
Neil turns to his packet, but Elliot, anxious, keeps talking.
ELLIOT SEE
Tough morning, huh? I barely lasted
two minutes in the ice bath. I saw
one of the military guys keep his
foot in so long it turned blue.
NEIL
I think NASA’s more interested in
psychological reactions than
physiological performance.
ELLIOT SEE
I just figured he probably didn’t do
so well on the intelligence tests.
This draws a smile, maybe the first we’ve seen from Neil.
SMALL CONNECTION. Which for Neil is no little thing.

A

DEKE
Armstrong.
Neil looks up. Deke stands by the door at the end of the
hall, a candidate slipping out behind him. Neil stands.
ELLIOT SEE
Good luck.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, ELLINGTON AFB - MOMENTS LATER
An empty chair in front of A PANEL OF MEN, including Bob
Gilruth, 48, who’s voice we heard earlier. In person, Gilruth
is tall, hawkish and as commanding as he sounded at the top.
Deke leads Neil in, introduces him.

19.
DEKE
Gentlemen, Neil Armstrong. Neil,
you know Bob Gilruth, Head of the
Manned Space Center; Chris Kraft,
our flight director; and we asked
John Glenn to sit in. I figure you
watched his flight with the rest of
the country.
If Neil’s impressed he doesn’t show it. He shakes hands with
Gilruth; CHRIS KRAFT, 37, looks like a 50s ad rep; and JOHN
GLENN, 40, clean cut, very much the American hero. Glenn
smiles as Neil sits in front of the panel.
JOHN GLENN
Deke said you flew for the Navy in
Korea. Panther, right?
NEIL
Yes, sir.
Yes, Neil was a Navy combat pilot. And if you’re surprised he
didn’t mention that in the hall, you’re not paying attention.
JOHN GLENN
Good lateral control, but pretty
stiff in pitch, am I right?
NEIL
Never bothered me much.
JOHN GLENN
(laughs)
Well, I didn’t fly as many missions
as you. But I bet I took more flak.
Glenn warm, smiles; Neil doesn’t.

Awkward.

Gilruth jumps in.

GILRUTH
Neil, we’ve been chatting with
candidates about the program so we
can get an idea of how everyone
thinks. Now, as I’m sure you know,
our decision to forego Direct Ascent
in favor of Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous
has had a major impact on Gemini.
CHRIS KRAFT
Do you have any thoughts on that
decision, Neil?
NEIL
I think it was a good decision.

20.
An awkward pause.
JOHN GLENN
Would you care to elaborate on that?
NEIL
Even taking Von Braun’s initial
criticism into account, the payload
saved by parking the primary vehicle
in lunar orbit seems well worth the
resulting challenges.
KRAFT
What do you see as the challenges?
NEIL
(considers)
Cislunar navigation for one. You’re
aiming for a narrower target,
inserting a craft into lunar orbit.
Of course, you’d also need to design
the smaller lunar excursion ship and
figure out how to land it.
A beat.

The panel waits.

Deke prompts Neil.

DEKE
Is that all, Neil?
NEIL
...well, the most difficult hurdles
would be rendezvous and docking.
But that’s only assuming you want to
get the men back.
Is he serious?

A beat, then Glenn LAUGHS.

The room follows suit, laughing hard, assuming Neil was
joking. Of course, it’s not clear that he was.
DEKE
Does anyone have anything else?
GILRUTH
Yes. Neil, I was very sorry to hear
about your daughter.
Neil nods, impassive.
NEIL
What’s the question?
GILRUTH
Well... how’s your wife?

21.
NEIL
I think she’s handling it well.
Off Gilruth, satisfied with Neil’s answer, we SMASH TO -INT. ARMSTRONG CABIN - NIGHT
Neil, Jan and Rick eat supper.

Deathly quiet, a PALLOR hangs.

RICK
Can I go play outside?
JANET
Just stay in the backyard where we
can see you.
Rick scurries off. Neil barely notices. A PAINFUL beat...
it’s a relief when the phone RINGS. Janet gets up, answers.
Hello?
Neil looks up.

JANET (INTO PHONE)
Yes, one second. Neil?

Janet holds out the phone.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
This is Neil. Yes. Uh huh.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Neil hangs up.

Processing.

He takes it.
Okay.

Then he sees Janet STARING.

NEIL
I got it.
He looks unsure.

So does Janet, but she buries her qualms.

JANET
It’s a fresh start.
NEIL
You think so?
JANET
It’ll be an adventure.
He looks out the window at the night sky, UNRESPONSIVE. Jan
PULLS HIM to her, trying to bridge the divide. Out of habit,
Neil wraps his arms around her, but his eyes remain LOCKED on
the sky. Off his focused gaze, we -FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:

Two Vostok

AGENT WELSH (O.C.)
Two weeks ago, the Soviets put two
manned spacecraft in orbit.
PULL BACK to find NEIL in the flickering light. He sits at a
small desk, taking COPIOUS NOTES as CIA AGENT JOHN WELSH
narrates from beside the REEL-TO-REEL PROJECTOR.
AGENT WELSH
Vostok 3 and 4 were launched the
same day and, at one point, orbited
within 75 miles of each other.
Near Neil, Elliot See looks GRIM, but Neil remains analytical
as Welsh finishes and Deke flips on a VU-GRAPH PROJECTOR.
DEKE
The Soviets are ahead of us on
rendezvous and everything else.
Which would scare the hell out of me
if I weren’t so pissed off.
Resolute, Deke puts a transparency on the overhead and DRAWS
(yep, it’s 1962) two circles. He labels them (EARTH, MOON)
then SKETCHES a rocket flying from one to the other...
DEKE
The rocket Von Braun’s building is
big, it should get us to the moon.
Course, a monkey could fly it. But
to get to the surface and back...
PUSH IN on Neil as Deke draws a SMALL SHIP flying from the
rocket to the surface, then returning to the original craft.
DEKE
...we’ll need men trained to catch
another ship in orbit and dock.
This is the primary mission of
Project Gemini.
Deke writes RENDEZVOUS. DOCKING.

Neil, INTENT, takes it down.

DEKE
Proving men can live in space for
the week it will take to get to the
moon and back, proving men can
survive and work outside the space
craft... these are secondary goals.

23.
DURATION. EXTRA VEHICULAR ACTIVITY (E.V.A.). Neil’s eyes
TICK from Deke to the screen to his notes, getting it down...
DEKE
Only if we master these tasks can we
move on to Apollo and consider
trying to land a man on the moon.
Gilruth flicks on the lights, revealing the nine Gemini men,
including Ed White and Pete Conrad, who we met baiting Neil.
Now Ed and Pete look TENSE, as do the rest of the men.
like Neil and Elliot, they’ve all taken COPIOUS NOTES.
GILRUTH
None of you need incentive.
this is very much a race --

And

But

DEKE
And we’re already more than a dick’s
length behind the other guy.
GILRUTH
...point is, the nine of you need to
stay focused, despite the new
pressures and the temptations that
will invariably come your way.
PETE CONRAD
So anything we can eat, drink or
screw within 24 hours, right?
Ed and some of the other men smirk.

Deke, Gilruth do NOT.

ED WHITE
We know the drill, we’re used to
this kind of attention.
GILRUTH
Due respect, Mr. White?

You’re not.

As he says this, we see something on Neil’s face we haven't
seen before. TREPIDATION. We hear a crowd ROAR and SMASH TO-INT. CULLEN AUDITORIUM, UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON - DAY
An 1,800 seat auditorium, filled to capacity.
Introduction of NASA Astronaut Group 2
September 17, 1962
REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS from the three major networks, the
major radio broadcasting systems, the wire services and dozens

GILRUTH (O.C., ON LOUDSPEAKER)
Neil A. Armstrong. Frank F. Borman,
Jr. Charles ‘Pete’ Conrad...
ON STAGE, Deke is with Gilruth, who introduces the astronauts.
They walk out, all in blue suits save Conrad, in white linen.
GILRUTH (ON LOUDSPEAKER)
James A. Lovell. James A. McDivitt.
Elliot M. See. Thomas P. Stafford.
Edward H. White, II. John W. Young.
These are The New Nine. This is

The crowd applauds, dozens of flashbulbs POP. TIGHT ON Neil,
a smile frozen on his face, eyes DARTING every which way.
NEIL’S POV. In BLURRED CUTS: flashbulbs; press; the crowd;
astronauts waving; Rick and Janet (pregnant)... It’s DIZZYING.
GILRUTH
We’ll open it up for questions now.
Gilruth points and a man from the AP stands.
AP REPORTER
Gentlemen, what drew you to apply
for the job?
We go down the line, the men are RELAXED.

QUICK, CUTTY --

FRANK BORMAN
I like to be on the first team.
PETE CONRAD
I wanted to be a part of it.
ELLIOT SEE
I feel this is the most important
thing I could possibly do.
ED WHITE
I felt I had something to give to
the program.
ON THE AP GUY, scribbling.

A beat, then he looks up.

AP REPORTER
Mr. Armstrong?
WHIP TO NEIL, UNCOMFORTABLE as we’ve seen.

Halting, STIFF --

25.
NEIL
It was the general challenge of...
the unknowns of the program... and
the general alignment of this part
of it with our national goals.
The men glance over.

Elliot CLOCKS Neil’s discomfort.

Then --

JOHN YOUNG
I agree with those other guys.
As the crowd dissolves into laughter, FLASHBULBS TAKE US TO -NASA ANNOUNCER (PRELAP)

We follow Ed’s gaze across two hundred yards of dirt to a
small, orange scaffold holding up a THIN, RED-TIPPED ROCKET.
Mercury 8 Launch, Cape Canaveral
October 3, 1962
At 90 feet tall, 5 feet in diameter, the rocket’s much smaller
than the Saturn to come. And clearly much less sophisticated.
NASA ANNOUNCER (LOUDSPEAKER)
Thirty seconds.

PETE CONRAD
Hard to believe Wally even
fits on top of that thing.

The men stare, SOBER, shaken by the fact that soon they’ll be
atop a rocket like this. PAN SLOWLY over their ANXIOUS FACES.
NASA ANNOUNCER (LOUDSPEAKER)
Fifteen.
Elliot See, Ed White... even Pete Conrad is nervous, fingers
crossed on both hands...
Ten.

LOUDSPEAKER
As the countdown begins in earnest we FIND NEIL.
to the others, Neil is TOTALLY CALM.

In contrast

LOUDSPEAKER
5, 4, 3, 2...
HOLD ON Neil as the rocket DROWNS OUT the call, his face AGLOW
with the flame of 200,000 pounds of thrust...
LOUDSPEAKER
Liftoff! Clock is started!
And as we hear the rocket lift, we HOLD ON Neil, on the
EMOTION in his eyes... a childlike look of WONDER.
INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - EARLY EVENING
CLOSE ON a CBS NEWS BROADCAST. WALTER CRONKITE (in large
earphones) at his desk. We see a chyron: CRISIS IN CUBA.
WALTER CRONKITE (ON TV)
If invasion is undertaken, the
Russians have said that they would
retaliate with rocket fire; we have
said if there's rocket fire from
Cuba we will retaliate and there
goes the, uh, whole ballgame.
PULL BACK to find JANET, PREGNANT, in a kitchen full of boxes.
No longer unpacking. PALE, she stares at the B&W TV... when
the doorbell RINGS. She walks into -INT. LIVING ROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - EARLY EVENING
Also full of boxes. Rick plays on the floor. Neil, on the
couch, marks up a thick binder labeled GEMINI. ENGROSSED, he
doesn’t look up as Janet walks in and opens the door.
Ed White stands with his WIFE PAT, 30.
Hey.

PAT
Pat White, we live next door?

JANET
Of course. Hello.

Janet Armstrong.

PAT
We only just moved in ourselves, but
we’ve got a couple days on y’all...
Pat holds out a Tupperware container of cookies.
JANET
Well, that’s awfully nice of you.
Neil comes to the door with his binder.
clearly this visit was Pat’s idea.

Ed’s uncomfortable;

27.
ED
Hey Neil. We have an assignment?
NEIL
No.
An awkward beat.

Pat fills it.

PAT
I’ve just about got the kitchen
squared. With everything going on
in the news, company might be nice,
I’ve already got some soup on...
NEIL
Ed and I have an early flight out.
Janet flushes, EMBARRASSED.
doesn’t miss a beat.

And disappointed.

But Pat

PAT
Oh, yes... you boys are heading to
Cleveland, right? Assuming the
world doesn’t end?
She smiles at Janet.

It almost sets Janet at ease.

JANET
Maybe another time?
PAT
Yes, of course, that’d be swell.
It’s just so nice to meet y’all.
Neil forces a smile back, then shuts the door.
EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - SAME TIME
Ed and Pat stand there.
Well.

PAT
ED
Told you.
As they turn and head back towards their house, we CUT TO -INT. MULTI-AXIS TRAINER ROOM, LEWIS FLIGHT CENTER - CLEVELAND
CLOSE ON a familiar pair of blue eyes. Ticking to a pair of
hands BUCKLING straps... PULLING them tight.

28.
FIND Neil in a cockpit chair, suspended within THREE
CONCENTRIC STEEL RINGS. Welcome to the MULTI-AXIS TRAINER.
MULTI-AXIS SUPE (O.C.)
This replicates roll coupling on all
three axis, the kind you might
encounter in space.
The SUPE nods to the hand controllers on the chair.
MULTI-AXIS SUPE
Trick is to take care of roll first,
then pitch and yaw will be easier.
Neil nods. The Supe starts the machine; the inner rings spin,
tossing Neil in all directions. Slowly at first, then FASTER.
PUSH IN on Neil. The chair speeds up, his head WHIPPING in
and out of frame as he struggles to analyze the spin.
His HANDS GRAB the controls... they CLICK several times... but
the machine just spins FASTER. Neil bores down... but it’s
fast, TOO FAST... His eyes droop... and we FADE TO GRAY.
DEKE (O.C.)
White, you’re up.
Neil blinks, OPENS HIS EYES.

The supe moves to unbuckle him.

NEIL
I’m good. Let’s go again.
The Supe STARES. Then turns to Deke. Who shrugs. The other
astronauts watch, curious, as the Supe tightens Neil's straps
and starts the machine again. As it spins, we PUSH INTO -NEIL’S POV. The room, spinning. And if it’s nauseating,
well, that's how it's supposed to feel.
Neil CLICKS the controls and the trainer slows... only to SPIN
FASTER. Shit. In BLURRED CUTS we see: the other ASTRONAUTS;
FLASHBULBS; PRESS; a CROWD... and again we FADE TO GRAY.
DEKE (O.C.)
Armstrong.
Neil OPENS HIS EYES.
Again.

Deke's bent over him.
NEIL

Deke’s SURPRISED. Ed White and a few others look ANNOYED, but
Deke responds to the look in Neil’s eyes. He nods to the
Supe, who pulls Neil's straps tight and leans in, WHISPERING --

29.
MULTI-AXIS SUPE
Use your inner ear.
As Neil processes, the Supe steps back, starts up the machine.
NEIL’S POV. This time, as he spins, Neil CLOSES his eyes.
THE SCREEN GOES DARK. But under the grating machine...
WE HEAR the PULSE SLOSHING in Neil’s inner ear. Then the
CLICK of the hand control. Again. And again... And as Neil
opens his eyes, the machine SLOWS...
And then STOPS. Elliot GAPES as the Supe unstraps Neil.
tries to stand, wobbles and falls... VOMITING all over.

Neil

Ed looks UNIMPRESSED.
ED
Serves him right.
DEKE
Clean him up.

White, strap in.

INT. BATHROOM, LEWIS FLIGHT CENTER - CLEVELAND
Neil stands, bent over a sink.

SHAKING.

A beat, then he steadies himself and tries to stand up... only
to start DRY HEAVING. Again. And AGAIN. Spittle forming at
the corners of his mouth.
Neil finally gets it under control. Pale, he spits in the
sink and splashes water on his face when... Ed walks in. In
the mirror, Neil sees Ed. Trying to look collected.
But as Ed stands there, he turns GREEN.

A beat, then...

Ed RUSHES INTO a stall. We hear him VOMITING off screen.
Neil, unimpressed himself, CUT TO --

Off

INT. TRAINER, ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE - DAY (POV)
CLOSE ON Elliot UPSIDE DOWN in a suit and helmet.

Sweating.

PETE CONRAD
You ready?
REVEAL Pete Conrad, also upside down, in the other seat of a
Gemini trainer. Surprisingly serious.
Elliot puts on a brave face, NODS. Conrad PULLS a handle and
the hatch doors under them SWING OPEN... WATER RUSHING IN.
As the men STRUGGLE to undo their harnesses, we CUT TO --

30.
INT. FLOTATION TANK ROOM, ELLINGTON AFB - CONTINUOUS
Neil and the astronauts stand at the edge of a pool with a few
TECHS, watching as the submerged capsule SHAKES in the water.
EGRESS SUPE
15 seconds... 25 seconds...
The EGRESS SUPE eyes his stopwatch. No one emerges. CONCERN
creeps across Neil's face... then Conrad surfaces, GASPING.
PETE CONRAD
Piece of cake.
Conrad sees the look on Neil’s face, REALIZES. And DIVES for
Elliot. Neil glances over at Deke, who doesn’t move.
EGRESS SUPE
45 seconds...
Neil STARES at the water. He can’t see what’s happening. His
eyes TICK from the rescue techs, to the Egress Supe, to Deke,
back to the water again. He scans it, his hand CLENCHING.
EGRESS SUPE
60 seconds, Deke.
At last, Deke nods to the rescue techs, who dive... just as
Conrad EMERGES with Elliot, SPUTTERING. Neil and others reach
down to pull him out of the pool as Deke jots down a NOTE.
DEKE
Lovell, Armstrong, suit up.
Neil hovers for a moment over Elliot.
DEKE
Armstrong, get your ass in gear!
SMASH TO -INT. CAPSULE (GONDOLA), JOHNSVILLE CENTRIFUGE - DAY
CLOSE ON NEIL in a low-tech capsule. STRAINING, his features
STRETCHED WIDE by the g forces. HOLD TIGHT on him, STRUGGLING
to breathe, trying to muscle it out. SMASH TO -INT. CENTRIFUGE ROOM, JOHNSVILLE CENTRIFUGE - MOMENTS LATER
Neil VOMITS beside the capsule, which is at the business end
of a MASSIVE CENTRIFUGE. PALE, Neil looks up as the next
victim approaches... it’s Elliot.
Elliot clocks how wrecked Neil is.

And BLANCHES.

SMASH TO --

INT. CLASSROOM, MANNED SPACE CENTER - CONTINUOUS
Neil, EXHAUSTED, collapses into a desk. As the other Gemini
men sit, Neil opens the THICK BINDER in front of him.

1. Equations defining stage performance
2. Theoretical optimization of stages
3. Practical techniques using digital computers
4. Trajectory losses (drag, gravity, potential energy velocity)

A man in a suit (HAMMOCK) walks in, turns on the vu-graph.
HAMMOCK
Gentlemen, I’m David Hammock, I’ll
be walking you through basic rocket
physics. We’ll just cover the first
chapter tonight.
Neil flips through the chapter.

It's 75 pages.

Jesus.

INT. HALLWAY, MANNED SPACE CENTER - EARLY EVENING
CLOSE ON a wall clock. 10pm. A lone janitor mops the hall.
It’s QUIET... then the classroom door OPENS. Neil and the
others stumble out, totally spent. They start to exit when...
DEKE (O.C.)
A couple of you have been asking
about assignments.
Neil and the others turn. Deke and Kraft stand behind them.
The men are suddenly WIDE AWAKE.
KRAFT
The first missions will test basic
functionality of the new capsule.
We’ve made selections accordingly.
You could hear a pin drop.
DEKE
Back ups will train alongside
primary crews for now. But there’ll
be plenty of flights for everyone.
The list is outside my office.
A beat.

Then the men GRAB their packs and RUSH INTO --

INT. ASTRONAUT OFFICES, MANNED SPACE CENTER - CONTINUOUS
Pete leads the way, Ed and the others at his heels, crowding
like high school kids around the LIST posted by Deke’s door.

PETE CONRAD
Shit, I’m flying with Gordo?
The men laugh as Neil walks out.

We see the list...

Backup
Schirra-Stafford
Borman-Lovell
Armstrong-See
JIM LOVELL
Punishment fits the crime...
Elliot turns to him.

ELLIOT SEE
We’re backup. Gemini 5.
Great.

NEIL
Unfazed, Neil exits with Elliot, not bothering to check the
list. Ed clocks this, puzzled... not getting Neil at all.
INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil’s at the dinner table. It's late, he eats alone, but
Janet sits with him, the new baby (MARK) asleep in her arms.
JANET
Rick had a nice time playing with
little Ed next door... the White’s
boy? They seem like nice folks.
It’s not oppressive, like after Karen died, but Neil’s
distant. Maybe he is upset about the backup assignment?
Neil?

JANET
NEIL
Sorry... There was this lecture on
orbital mechanics. About how to
rendezvous with the Agena? If you
thrust, you wind up going slower
because it puts you in a higher
orbit. You need to reduce thrust
and drop to a lower orbit to catch
up. It’s backwards from what you
learn as a pilot but if you work the
math, it follows. It’s kinda neat.

33.
Janet reacts.

Trying not to laugh.

NEIL
Well, it is.
JANET
Yes, I’m sure that’s how all the
other guys feel.
Neil smiles. Then chuckles, RELAXING. A nice, shared
moment... atypical these days. Off Janet, ENJOYING it -INT. BATHROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil stands in boxers and a T-shirt, BRUSHING his teeth.
Perfect little circles on each tooth. His mind elsewhere.
Janet, in a nightgown, slips up behind him. Her hand reaches
around his stomach... then DOWN into his boxers.
At first, Neil doesn’t notice. Then his mind and brush SLOW.
His eyes TICK to Janet in the mirror. CONSIDERING. Janet
looks up at him. Insistent.
A beat, then Neil turns, kissing her.
blouse, we CUT TO --

As he pulls at her

INT. BEDROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Dark. Quiet. The windows open, a breeze plays on the drapes,
moving over Janet and Neil, NAKED on the bed. We hear a
CRACKLING in the b/g... and Janet stirs. She sits up, sleepy.
Her expression CLOUDS.

She nudges Neil, softly.

Then HARDER.

JANET
Do you smell that?
Neil sits up, groggy. Half awake, still processing, he gets
out of bed, tosses on his boxers and heads down the hall.
Janet waits. A beat, then SMOKE CURLS IN through the doorway.
Janet's eyes WIDEN as she hears Neil from the hall.
NEIL (O.C.)
Call the fire department.
Janet, stunned, reaches for the phone as we PUSH INTO -INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Neil runs down the HALLWAY, the roof IN FLAMES. Neil coughs,
pushes through the smoke, pausing at the door to...

34.
RICK’S ROOM.

Rick sits up in bed.

Disoriented.

NEIL
Follow your mother outside.
Rick nods and Neil moves on down the hall, HUSTLING INTO -THE NURSERY. FILLED with smoke, the baby CRYING in the crib.
Neil grabs the baby, covers him in a blanket and RUNS OUT,
hurrying down the HALL into...
THE FAMILY ROOM. All smoke and fire, we can’t even see Neil.
We hear him COUGH, STRUGGLING to breathe...
...then find him as he PUSHES THROUGH the back door into -EXT. BACKYARD, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Neil holds the baby, GASPING for breath, eyes TICKING...
...to ED WHITE, rushing across his yard to help...
...to the TERRIFYING BLAZE already engulfing most of the roof.
...to JANET, standing there, staring.

Lost.

And ALONE.

Neil PROCESSES, rushing to Janet and handing her the baby.
JANET
Ricky...
Neil’s already on it, already turning back towards the house
when... A SECTION OF THE ROOF COLLAPSES.
Janet turns WHITE. Neil quickly grabs a wet towel off the
clothes line, covers his face and RUNS BACK INTO -INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The walls of THE FAMILY ROOM now GLOWING RED. Glass windows
CRACK, the smoke forcing Neil onto hands and knees.
HOLD ON Neil as he CRAWLS, groping his way into THE HALL, the
towel tight on his face, walls IN FLAMES around him. We feel
the heat as Neil INCHES along, eyes FIXED on a FARAWAY DOOR...
PUSH IN on Neil as the roar of the fire FADES and we hear the
FAMILIAR UNNERVING WHINE of Karen’s Cobalt Machine...
Neil blocks it out, reaching the door and pushing it open...
Neil peers into RICK’S ROOM. Smoke and fire everywhere.
Neil's eyes TICK across the room, scanning for Rick.

35.
PUSH IN on his eyes, on something we haven't seen... FEAR.
The ODD WHINE SCREAMS above the din and Neil FREEZES, the
thought of yet another loss creeping in...
...until another SOUND pierces through.
Faint at first, then LOUDER. A child’s whimper. Neil’s eyes
DART to... Rick, TERRIFIED, hiding under his bed. Neil LUNGES
forward, scoops Rick up, wrapping him in the towel...
...as the fire seems to EBB. Neil confused, turns.
ED, through the window, hosing down the roof.

And spots

The fire ROARS. Neil snaps to, RUSHES through THE HALL into
THE FAMILY ROOM. ENGULFED AGAIN by smoke, he FALTERS... then
holds Rick for dear life and CHARGES through the door into -EXT. BACKYARD, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Neil carries Rick out, pulls off the towel and looks at him.
NEIL
You need to listen to what I say.
It’s stark. ANGRY. Rick starts to CRY... as Janet rushes
over, RELIEVED. She takes Rick and Neil moves towards the
VOLUNTEER FIREMEN pouring out of the small FIRE TRUCK...
...but Neil starts to WHEEZE. He has to pause, bending over,
STRUGGLING to catch his breath just as...
THE REST OF THE ROOF COLLAPSES. Ed and the firemen are forced
back. Janet reacts, EYES WIDE... but Neil just stares at the
blaze, at what's left of the house. EMOTIONLESS.
Janet reaches for Neil, but he’s already moving towards Ed...
NEIL
Fire’s heading towards the garage,
help me get the cars out?
Ed follows Neil to the garage... leaving Janet with the kids.
Alone. Watching her house burn to the ground. DISSOLVE TO -EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - MORNING
A birds-eye view of the house... now wet, black RUBBLE and
DYING EMBERS, smoke still reaching skyward.
Neil picks through the wreckage as we PULL BACK into --

INT. UPSTAIRS GUEST ROOM, ED & PAT WHITE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
By the window, Janet holds the baby and a CHARRED WEDDING
ALBUM. She looks down at a half destroyed PHOTO, Neil in a
tuxedo. BEAMING. Lighter than we’ve ever seen him.
Janet glances out the window, at what’s left of her house, at
a very different Neil picking through the rubble.
She FIGHTS to contain her emotions.
PAT
We can put Rick in with Ed Jr. If
this is big enough for you all?
Janet pulls herself together, closing the album and turning to
Pat, who’s walked in with sheets and towels.
JANET
Of course. Deke is already working
on finding us a rental, so it
shouldn’t be too long.
PAT WHITE
Hush. It’ll be nice to have a few
more voices ‘round the house. Not
like Ed’s ever home.
Janet smiles, appreciative as a doorbell RINGS.

CUT TO --

INT. FOYER, ED & PAT WHITE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ed opens the door, finds Elliot and his wife MARILYN SEE, 30s.
Marilyn holds a brisket; Elliot, his baby son and a bag.
Elliot and Ed aren’t that friendly; it’s a bit AWKWARD.
Elliot.

ED
ELLIOT SEE
We heard Neil and Janet were-Pat and Janet walk in.

JANET
Marilyn, Elliot?

Marilyn holds out the brisket.

MARILYN
It was the least we could do.
ELLIOT SEE
And the girls insisted on sending
some of their things.
He holds out a bag of Barbie dolls.

Janet laughs, touched.

37.
ELLIOT SEE
Where’s Neil?
JANET
He’s still over at the house.
ED
I thought we got everything.
JANET
You did.
Off Ed, CONFUSED, CUT TO -INT./EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - DAY
Neil in the rubble with a FIRE INSPECTOR, 50s, nonchalant.
FIRE INSPECTOR
Probably a short in the wiring.
I’ll write it up, send it over to
the insurance company.
The inspector starts to go, but Neil doesn’t move.
NEIL
Fire came from the family room, we’d
just replaced the ceiling panels...
FIRE INSPECTOR
I’m sure they’ll cover it, Mr.
Armstrong.
But Neil takes out a logbook and kneels, SCANNING the rubble.
The inspector STARES and we...
ED (O.C.)
...the hell?
PULL BACK to find Ed and Elliot at the edge of the yard.
ELLIOT SEE
Uh, he’s trying to -- `
Ed shakes his head.

ED
I know what he’s doing.

A beat, then he has an idea.

ED
Let’s take a ride.
They head off and we TIME CUT TO --

38.
EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - DAY
Sunset. Wide on the house. Against the setting sun, the
SILHOUETTE of a man... Neil inspecting the rubble. TIRELESS.
A beat, then we see Neil bend down...
ANGLE ON a BLACKENED BRACELET amidst ruined keepsakes in the
rubble. Neil wipes it off. K A R... the rest unreadable.
CLOSE ON Neil’s eyes -- a HINT of emotion. Then he stands.
MOVING ON. Inching over the collapsed roof, looking for
something else. And then bending down again...
NEIL
Looks like it started here, probably
was one of the paneling nails.
FIRE INSPECTOR
So we’re good?
The exhausted inspector walks over, wiping his forehead.
Yep.

NEIL
We just have to find the nail.

The inspector, EXASPERATED, stares as Neil digs into the roof.
Neil!

ED (O.C.)
Ed’s in the yard with Elliot, holding the bag. He waves Neil
over. A beat, then Neil joins them. Ed holds out the bag.
ED
Present.
Neil, confused, takes the bag. He opens it, pulls out a brand
new ‘IONIZATION CHAMBER SMOKE DETECTOR.’
ED
Smoke enters the chamber, it
disrupts the current, thing screams
like a son of a bitch.
ELLIOT SEE
He got one for every house in the
development.
A beat.

Neil looks up at Ed, SURPRISED.
ED
How ‘bout a break?

And GRATEFUL.

39.
INT. DINING ROOM, ED & PAT WHITE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
The three couples sit eating, kids playing in the family room.
Janet’s had a few glasses of wine.
PAT
I can’t imagine how frightening it
must have been, waking up like that.
JANET
It would’ve been worse if I hadn’t.
MARILYN
Well, sure. But you’re just
handling this so well. Both of you.
She smiles at Neil.

He nods, awkward.

NEIL
At this point it’s just an
inconvenience. Time spent on things
which aren’t very productive. Like
getting into another house.
JANET
Yes, I’m sure it’ll take up a lot of
your time.
Neil blinks, SURPRISED.

Elliot laughs.

MARILYN
What are you laughing at?
ELLIOT
Nothing.
JANET
(to Pat and Marilyn)
Do you think this is how the
cosmonauts treat their wives?
PAT
Maybe it’s how the female cosmonauts
treat their husbands.
ED
That’s enough.
PAT
No, I think we’ve hit on something.
Maybe this is the problem.
MARILYN
No female astronauts?

40.
PAT
Why do you think we’re behind?
ED
We’re not behind.
PAT
Right. The Russians are sending
women up in space and I can’t even
attend a launch at the Cape.
Really?

MARILYN
What?

JANET

PAT
No wives at the Cape. I asked about
Ed’s flight, that’s what Deke said.
ED
It’s NASA policy.
PAT
‘Cause God forbid there’s a photo of
me reacting if the rocket explodes.
This is starting to get uncomfortable.
ED
Deke and Chris just don’t want any
distractions.
PAT
From what I understand, there are
all sorts of distractions.
Honey --

ED
PAT
Don’t honey me.
NEIL
This reminds me of a story.
They turn to Neil, surprised.
NEIL
A fella I know made plans to play
golf on his wedding anniversary.
His wife got very upset. They had a
spat, as couples do. She accused
him of loving golf more than her.
And the fella, well, he shrugged.
(acting it)
“I love you more than tennis.”

41.
A beat. It’s not particularly funny, but from Neil it’s
surprising. And hilarious. The table bursts out laughing.
EXT. ED WHITE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
WIDE ON the yard. The house cozy, the windows casting warm
light, the yard dotted with fireflies. And then over the
crickets, we hear faint STATIC. And chatter... in RUSSIAN.
PAN UP to the stars above. HOLD ON them as the Comms continue.
Chilling, spooky. And as we wonder what it means, PRELAP -RICK (PRELAP)
I’m on the lookout for Dr. Zin.
EXT. PORCH, WHITE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Rick crouching by the porch with a walkie talkie.
RICK (INTO WALKIE)
I’m on the lookout for Dr.
Zin. Copy?

ED JR (OVER WALKIE)
Roger, I’m flying to you.

Nearby, Neil watches Rick, CALM.

Elliot holds up a SEXTANT.

ELLIOT
Vega, Rigel. 8 degrees.
Neil nods, takes Elliot’s sextant.
Yes.

Check me?

Surveys the two stars.

NEIL
8 degree angle.

ELLIOT
You want to do Antares and Nunki?
Neil nods, takes a reading. Ed walks outside with beers.
sees Neil with the sextant and SHOOTS a look at Elliot.
ELLIOT
We head to Morehead on Thursday.
ED
(sarcastic)
So why not waste a Saturday night.
Neil ignores him, keeps at it.

Elliot looks over at Ed.

ELLIOT
You’ve been down there, right?

He

42.
ED
To Morehead? Yeah. It’s cool, they
shift star positions to mimic an off
course craft. Bitch of a sim, but
it’s how Cooper aligned Faith 7 when
his navigation controls failed.
NEIL
Good thing to know, I guess.
Ed looks at Neil. Then chuckles, good-natured. Elliot does
too. And Neil smiles, a bit surprised at the BOND FORMING.
INT. KITCHEN, WHITE’S HOUSE - LATER
Pat and Jan do dishes; Ed, Neil and Elliot in the window.
Marilyn sits on the couch in the b/g with her youngest.
PAT
Your husband has a sense of humor.
JANET
A little corny.
PAT
I never would have guessed.
JANET
I’m a bit surprised myself.
A phone RINGS. Pat goes to get it, but we HOLD ON Jan,
watching Neil with the others.
Ed?

PAT (O.C.)
Deke’s on the phone.

Ed hustles in. Neil follows behind, notices Janet’s stare.
As Ed picks up the phone, Neil drifts over to her.
What?

NEIL
JANET
Nothing. Just looking at you.
She’s warm.

Neil smiles, a bit mystified.
WALTER CRONKITE (ON TV)
...Leonov is tethered to Voshkod 2,
but nothing separates him from space
other than his pressure suit...

Neil turns. Ed’s flipped on the TV. Neil’s smile FADES as he
sees B&W FOOTAGE of A COSMONAUT FLOATING OVER EARTH.

43.
Neil tightens.

The camera ominously PUSHES IN on the TV...

WALTER CRONKITE (ON TV)
...a pressure suit we’re told was
designed for the lunar surface.
This is, of course, mankind’s first
E.V.A., or Extra-Vehicular Activity.
BANG!

Ed SLAMS his fist against the wall in frustration.
Shit.

ED
A beat, then Ed grabs his bag.

Neil shoots him a look.

ED
They’ve added another mission
objective to Gemini 4.
Ed heads out the door but we HOLD ON Neil, PUSHING IN ON HIM
as the RUSSIAN COMMS on TV get LOUDER and we -FADE OUT.
OVER BLACK we hear the sound of U.S. COMMS -ED (PRELAP, COMMS)
Am I in your view, Jimbo?
INT. MISSION CONTROL CENTER (MCC), MSC - HOUSTON - DAY
ANOTHER SCREEN.

B&w footage.

An ASTRONAUT floats in space.

JIM (COMMS)
You’re right in front, Ed.
REVERSE to Neil and Elliot, watching RAPT, as we realize the
floating astronaut is Ed.
Gemini IV, Mission Day 1
June 3, 1965
Welcome to MISSION CONTROL, the latest, greatest tech of 1965.
PUSH BUTTONS, ROTARY PHONES. Monitors of NUMBERS, STATIC MAPS
on the big screens, a scrolling STYLUS tracking the capsule.
ED (COMMS)
This is the greatest experience
I’ve... it’s just tremendous.
Neil SMILES at Elliot as Deke enters with a group of men.

44.
DEKE
Gentlemen, Neil Armstrong and Elliot
See, our backups on Gemini Five.
(to Neil, Elliot)
These are the fourteen newbies.
Keep an eye on them, would you?
As Deke heads off, Elliot notices a NEWBIE holding court.
NEWBIE (BUZZ)
Ed and I were stationed together in
Germany. He called me a few days
ago to ask if I had tips for him
based on my doctorate. I found that
amusing, of course. I only went to
MIT on his recommendation.
Neil glances over at BUZZ ALDRIN, 33. Smart, arrogant, TONE
DEAF; he clearly annoys the others. And the flight director.
KRAFT
Cut the chatter.
The room quiets.

Kraft nods to CAPCOM GUS GRISSOM, 39, gruff.

GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 4, Houston Cap Com,
let’s bring Ed in now.
GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 4, do you read me?

ED (COMMS)
Right now I’m standing on my
head, I’m looking down on...
ED (COMMS)
My golly, I’m looking right
in the bay there!

Ed and Jim clearly don’t hear Gus.
GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 4, Houston; Gemini 4 --

GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Have Ed get his ass back in!
Kraft glances at EECOM.

JIM (COMMS)
Ed, I’m gonna PUSH-TO-TALK,
see what the Flight Director
has to say. Gus, any message?
EECOM ENGINEER
45 seconds to Loss of Signal.

Neil catches it, notes his CONCERN.

JIM (COMMS)
They want you back now, Ed.

ED (COMMS)
I’m trying to get a picture
of the spacecraft.

45.
JIM (COMMS)
No, back in. Come on.

ED (COMMS)
...Saddest moment of my life.

EECOM ENGINEER
30 seconds to Bermuda LOS.
The video feed BREAKS UP.

A long, silent beat.

GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
20 seconds to LOS, are you
getting him back in? Jim -EECOM ENGINEER
10 seconds -Shit.

Neil watches INTENT.

GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 4, give me a status.
Is he getting back in, Jim?

JIM (COMMS)
He’s having some trouble
getting into the space craft.
FLIGHT SURGEON
Pilot’s heart rate is
spiking. He’s up to 180 bps.
The whole room looks concerned.
JIM (COMMS)
Listen, we’re kinda busy! If
you don't have something for
us, wait a couple --

The audio turns to STATIC.
EECOM ENGINEER
Loss of Signal.

KRAFT
Switch to UHF.

The EECOM engineer hits a switch; the static turns to SILENCE.
GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 4, Houston Cap Com. Gemini
4, give me your status.
CLOSE ON Neil and Elliot as they wait, the TENSION PALPABLE.
All the newbies, even Buzz, STARE. The silence is DEAFENING.
PUSH IN on Neil, eyes TICKING from screen to console.
GRISSOM
Gemini 4, do you -Neil RELAXES.

A beat.

ED (COMMS)
...that was something. That
was the most natural feeling.

We hear more voices over comms.

CARNAVON CAP COM (COMMS)
Gemini 4, Carnavon Cap Com.

JIM (COMMS)
Hello Carnavon. We are back
inside the spacecraft. We
are repressurized to 5 PSI...

46.
As the room lets out a collective breath, CUT TO -INT. MISSION CONTROL CENTER, MSC - HOUSTON - NIGHT
It’s late.

Gus, exhausted, sits listening to Ed.
ED (COMMS)
...then with Jim pulling hard as he
could and me pulling down as best I
could, we forced me down into my
seat and got the hatch closed.

PAN TO Neil, standing beside Gus.

Listening, RAPT.

ED (COMMS)
I’m just glad we didn’t have to make
a re-entry with the hatch open.
GRISSOM (INTO COMMS)
Us too, Ed.
(to Neil, sotto)
Hold the fort, I gotta use the can.
Gus slips away.

The flight surgeon approaches with a NOTE.

ED (COMMS)
But there was no disorientation
whatsoever. I was using my tether,
actually walking on the spacecraft.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
(off the note)
Ed, the doc wants the sleep period
changed to let you get some rest.
ED (COMMS)
Armstrong? Is that Neil?
NEIL
Yes. He’d like you to go
four hours --

ED (COMMS)
Have you seen Pat? Did she
and the kids hear the EVA?

NEIL
...uh, yeah. Jan said they listened
on the squawk box.
ED (COMMS)
Oh, that’s terrific.
to worry, I’m dandy.

Tell them not

Neil smiles, DISTRACTED from the task at hand. He almost
seems bemused by Ed’s warmth towards him, by the STRENGTH of
their connection... Neil seems as HUMAN as we’ve ever seen.

47.
NEIL
I’ll tell them. It sounds great,
Ed. Like... it’s really something.
ED (COMMS)
Sure as hell is. Wait ‘til you get
up here. You’ll flip.
A NICE MOMENT.. ‘til Neil sees the doc GLARING.
NEIL
I bet. Listen, the doc would really
like if you could get some sleep.
ED (COMMS)
Okay. I’ll give it a try. But just
you wait, you won’t be able to sleep
either. Not with this view.
Off Neil -EXT. MCC BUILDING, MSC - HOUSTON - NIGHT
Wide on a LARGE WINDOWLESS STRUCTURE, lit up against the
night. A sign, block letters: Mission Control Center.
FIND Neil. Heading across the parking lot, lost in thought.
But as he reaches the car... he PAUSES. And looks up...
A sky of stars. We know Ed’s up there, in orbit, but it’s not
warmth or wonder in Neil’s eyes. It’s something else...
...YEARNING.
EXT. CAPE KENNEDY/INT. GEMINI V CAPSULE - EARLY MORNING
A beautiful morning.

GEMINI-TITAN V steaming on the pad.

NEIL (COMMS)
Push-To-Talk Comm check.
Commander push-to-talk --

KSC CAPCOM (COMMS)
Yes, we read you, Neil.
We’re at T minus 2 hours.

PUSH IN CLOSER to the white room level, just outside the
capsule. Men in flight suits prep for launch.
Gemini V, Pre-Launch
August 21, 1965
Holy shit, are Neil and Elliot about to head into space?
Just as we think they are, we PUSH INTO the capsule... to find
the two of them not in spacesuits, but in routine FLIGHT GEAR.

48.
ELLIOT (INTO COMMS)
Pilot Push-To-Talk.

GORDO COOPER (COMMS)
Read you loud and clear.

Elliot looks up, sees GORDO COOPER, 38, brusque, and Pete
Conrad. In SPACESUITS.
PETE CONRAD (COMMS)
We got it, fellas.
Neil and Elliot (the backups) step out, awkwardly helping
Cooper and Conrad into the small capsule. As Neil buckles in
Pete, he eyes the Gemini 5 Patch on his arm. 8 DAYS OR BUST.
INT./EXT. LAUNCH PAD ELEVATOR, PAD 19 - MOMENTS LATER
Neil, Elliot ride down the side of the Titan rocket. And yes,
it’s more substantial than the Mercury Atlas, but at 100 feet,
it still feels puny compared to the Apollo we all know.
ELLIOT SEE
Think the docs know what eight days
in space’ll do to those guys?
NEIL
Might kill both of them.
ELLIOT SEE
It’d be quieter ‘round here.
NEIL
Sounds nice.
Elliot SMILES. Then Neil does. Clearly, they’re even closer.
The elevator stops and Neil and Elliot walk out onto -THE LAUNCH PAD. They move to confer with Deke and a few
engineers, Elliot shouting over the steaming rocket...
ELLIOT SEE
System checks look good, hydrogen’s
steady at 101.5...
As Elliot continues, Deke pulls Neil aside.
Gemini capsule just ten stories up...

He nods at the

DEKE
Those two make it back, we’ll be one
up on the Soviets. Not much of a
lead, but one we don’t want to lose.
(then)
I’m putting you in command of Gemini
8. Like 6 and 7, rendezvous and
docking will be your primary goal.

49.
NEIL
Elliot and I will start training.
DEKE
I’m gonna pair you with Dave Scott.
We’ve got a pretty strenuous E.V.A.
planned for eight, Dave’s a horse.
Conrad will serve as your backup.
Neil pauses, looks back at Elliot.
DEKE
We’ll put that brain of his to work.
But these missions are key to
Apollo. We wanna beat Brezhnev to
the moon, we gotta be ready soon as
Werner has the rocket to take us.
Off Neil, processing this, we CUT TO -INT. GEMINI CAPSULE TRAINER, TRAINING HANGAR, MSC - DAY
DAVE SCOTT, 35, very good looking and very enthusiastic.
DAVE SCOTT
Pretty exciting mission, huh?
FIND Neil sitting beside Dave as a MECHANICAL ARM slowly pulls
their Gemini trainer away from a mock Agena docking satellite.
DAVE SCOTT
I mean, it’s the whole ball of wax,
everything we need for Apollo.
E.V.A., rendezvous, we’ll be one of
the first to dock with the Agena...
Neil remains focused on a Gemini instrument chart, reaching
for instruments without looking up, going over their position.
DAVE SCOTT
Can’t ask for a better assignment.
Heck, I don’t think I’ve been this
jazzed since they asked me to swim
Varsity as a freshman in High -NEIL
Could you be quiet?
Dave, surprised, eyes Neil, who keeps studying the Gemini
instruments... the slightest hint of ANNOYANCE on his face.
DAVE SCOTT
Didn’t you do this already?

On 5?

50.
Neil doesn’t respond. Dave, now annoyed himself, opens his
manual. For a moment, they work in silence. And off Neil,
perhaps wishing it were Elliot beside him, PRELAP -ELLIOT SEE (PRELAP, COMMS)
NASA 7 descending through 2,000
feet, permission to approach.
INT. T-38 FRONT COCKPIT, OVER LAMBERT AFB - NIGHT (POV)
Elliot sits in front, managing the T-38 descent for landing.
Some light turbulence, clouds all around. ZERO VISIBILITY.
ELLINGTON TOWER (COMMS)
Nasa 7, you’re cleared for
approach, come on down outta
that soup...

ELLIOT SEE (INTO COMMS)
Roger that. Coming in.

As Elliot guides the plane down, he chats with his co-pilot in
the rear cockpit, CHARLIE BASSETT, 34, all American.
CHARLIE BASSETT (COMMS)
How long we here?
ELLIOT SEE (INTO COMMS)
A while. Deke wants the new Agena
ready for March.
CHARLIE BASSETT
So 8’d get the first shot? Sets
Neil and Dave up good for Apollo.
Elliot doesn’t say anything.

The slightest hint of ENVY.

CHARLIE BASSETT (COMMS)
Thank god I didn’t pull that
assignment. Poor Dave, Armstrong’s
gonna run him ragged.
ELLIOT SEE (INTO COMMS)
(smiles)
That is an upside to training with
Neil. Next assignment’s a cakewalk.
Bassett LAUGHS as they drop through 500 feet, breaking through
clouds. Elliot visually clocks his position...
...and instantly sees HE’S SHORT.
CHARLIE BASSETT (COMMS)
We’re low and slow, Elliot...

51.
ELLIOT SEE (INTO COMMS)
Damn radar.
(a quick decision)
I don’t wanna get lost in the clouds
again, I’m just gonna go round.
He hits the afterburners, pulls the stick to make a low turn.
CHARLIE BASSETT (COMMS)
Elliot...
We hear the ANXIETY in Bassett's voice as Elliot sees... THE
PLANE IS ROCKETING TOWARDS A TALL NASA BUILDING!!! OH SHIT!!!
CHARLIE BASSETT (COMMS)
Pull up. Elliot...

ELLIOT SEE
Dammit... Dammit...

Elliot YANKS up on the stick, but it’s not enough. As they
SPEED towards the building ELLIOT'S EYES WIDEN and we...
SMASH TO -INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
NEIL. Quiet. Studying rendezvous and docking calculations in
a notebook, his dinner off to one side.
RICK
Are you excited?
REVEAL Janet, Rick and Mark (now 8 and 4) also at the table,
eating dinner. It's raining hard out, real Texas thunder.
Dad?

RICK
JANET
Honey, let your father eat
his -Neil looks at Rick.

NEIL
Excited about what?

Janet watches, surprised.

RICK
That you might be first.

To dock.

NEIL
Well, you have to prepare for all
sorts of eventualities when you do
something first. There’s much
greater risk of failure.
(MORE)

52.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Fact is, the only reason we might be
first is cause the first Agena
exploded after separation and it’s
going to take a few months to build
the new one.
Neil returns to his notebook, oblivious to WIDE-EYED Mark.
MARK
A ship exploded?
JANET
It was just a satellite, honey.
one was hurt.

No

Before Jan can say more we hear a KNOCK... Neil doesn’t even
notice. Janet, used to this, gets up, walks to door...
...and opens it.
Hey.

Ed’s on the porch.

SOAKED from the rain.

ED
Jan, can I speak to him?

JANET
Uh, sure. You want to come in?
No.

ED
Janet sees something in his eyes.

Knows better than to ask.

EXT. PORCH, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - HOUSTON - MOMENTS LATER
Neil walks out onto the porch.
Hey.
Hey.

NEIL
ED
I have some bad news.

NEIL
The delays on the Agena? I don’t
think we’ll lose much time. Puts
the pressure on Dave and me, but -Neil.
Neil stops.

ED
Sees it’s something else.

53.
ED
Elliot and Charlie were flying into
Lambert. Their plane... they
crashed on approach.
Neil takes this in. Knowing from the look on Ed’s face that
neither Elliot nor Charlie made it.
The two of them stand there in AWFUL SILENCE.

Nothing to say.

INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - MOMENTS LATER
Neil walks back in.

Sits down at the table.

RICK
So are they going to make the new
Agena better? Dad?
Neil looks over at Rick.
What?

Lost.

NEIL
RICK
Are they going to make the new Agena
better? So it doesn’t explode?
NEIL
Uh, yes. I’m, I’m sure they...
Neil trails off, clearly elsewhere.

Janet intercedes.

JANET
Ricky, go get your math homework so
I can check.
Rick nods, heads off to his room. Janet glances over at Mark,
playing with his peas, then quietly leans over to Neil.
JANET
Who was it?
Elliot.
Janet pales.

NEIL
CUT TO --

EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - DAY
Gray, rainy. SIX BLACK HORSES pull a caisson bearing a FLAG
DRAPED COFFIN into Section 4 of the famous cemetery, TWO NAVAL
PLATOONS and a COLOR GUARD alongside.

54.
The horses stop. The Navy men lift the coffin and carry it
past a 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL. In tears. The girl, Elliot’s
daughter, stands with Marilyn and Elliot’s other children...
...but we HOLD ON her as she watches the casket pass and SOBS,
burying her face in ED’S OVERCOAT. Ed puts an arm around her,
fighting it himself, holding on to Pat and looking over at...
Janet and Neil. Who’s BLANK. His face devoid of emotion, his
features FROZEN... save for HIS EYES. DARTING from the
coffin... to the CRANK by the grave... to Elliot's daughter.
And for a moment, she looks just like Neil’s daughter Karen.
PUSH IN on Neil’s eyes and MATCH CUT TO -EXT. PORCH, ELLIOT SEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil, staring down at a SEXTANT.

He turns it in his hands.

PETE CONRAD (O.C.)
Wouldja believe Mondale cornered me
at Arlington? Senator thought it
was a good time to ask why we don’t
just send machines to the moon?
PULL BACK to a circle of astronauts nearby. Conrad, Lovell,
Scott and others pass a bottle of vodka, a lime inside.
Shit.

DAVE SCOTT
How the hell did this happen?

JIM LOVELL
Cernan told me the cloud cover was
down to 500 feet. A low go-around
underneath low clouds, that’s tough.
Probably never saw the building.

Clearly, the error was the approach.
Conrad glances at Buzz Aldrin.

Even he’s taken aback.

BUZZ
The T-38 stalls below 270 knots.

He

The men go quiet. Buzz may be right, but it’s not the time.
Uneasy, they look away... save for Neil. Who STARES at Buzz.
What?
Neil does.

BUZZ
Tell me you disagree.

But he just turns, walks into --

55.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ELLIOT AND MARILYN SEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil, tense, moves through the gathered mourners, eyes
darting, SEARCHING for Janet. We CUT INTO NEIL’S POV -...eyes ticking past WIVES raising hands in greeting...
...past ED waving, calling to Neil from across the room...
...pausing on ELLIOT’S PHOTO on the mantle...
Neil KEEPS GOING until he spots Janet.

He moves SWIFTLY into--

INT. KITCHEN, ELLIOT AND MARILYN SEE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Janet lays cookies out on a tray.

Neil rolls up beside her.

NEIL
Let’s go.
JANET
I told Pat I’d help put out dessert.
NEIL
(quiet)
I need to go.
Okay.

JANET
It’ll just be another minute.

She keeps plating cookies... until she realizes Neil’s gone.

JANET
She turns. We hear the car start before we see it.
pulling away and driving off. Off Janet --

Neil

INT. ED WHITE’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER
Close on Janet.

In the backseat.

Upset and embarrassed.

JANET
I’m sorry. I hate to be a bother.
PAT
It’s no bother.
Ed drives.

Pat beside him.

A beat.

JANET
Has he ever talked to you about her?
About Karen?

56.

Janet stares out the window.

But never to him.
Off Ed, processing, we --

EXT. ARMSTRONG BACK PORCH - LATER
Neil stands under the stars, taking readings with the sextant.
Practicing. Jotting notes down in a logbook beside him.
ED
Hey.
Ed walks up.

Neil just keeps taking readings.

A beat.

ED
Lovell said Buzz was mouthing off.
Certainly wasn’t the place for it.
Neil glances over.

Something not sitting well.

ED
You know Deke had doubts about
Elliot. Deke moved him off Eight.
NEIL
Deke wanted him for command.
ED
Neil. Elliot always flew too slow.
(then)
I mean, it’s tough to blame a guy
for his own death. And Aldrin’s an
asshole. But you of all people know-NEIL
(hot)
No. I don’t. I didn’t investigate
the crash, I didn’t study the flight
trajectory, I wouldn’t pretend to
know what happened.
Ed’s surprised.

Neil’s DARK, more emotional than we’ve seen.

NEIL
You all want to make yourselves feel
better, but this had, it had nothing
to do with Elliot. You know the
odds, this... it happens, it’ll
happen again and if you can’t handle
it... you should do something else.

57.
Neil contains himself, turns away.
ED
Neil. Hey, we’re all broken
up here, I didn’t mean to --

What?

Starts taking readings.

NEIL
I need to practice.

ED
NEIL
We’re going to be the first to dock,
I need to practice.
ED
Shit. You should be with your wife,
playing with your kids -NEIL
And you should be minding your own
damn business.
He’s COLD.

Ed reacts.

Then walks off.

As he goes, we see...

Janet. In the window, a tired look in her eyes. She watches
as Neil takes another reading. He seems unmoved. Exhausted,
Janet turns away, and we RACK FOCUS back to...
Neil. SHAKING. As RATTLED as we’ve seen. He lowers the
sextant... and stares down at the small label. “E. SEE.”
INT. UPSTAIRS FOYER, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil walks up the stairs. He turns off the light and starts
to head into the bedroom... when he HESITATES.
He walks to the door across the hall, looks in at Rick and
Mark in their beds, sleeping soundly. As he stands there, we
PUSH IN on his eyes. Filled with TEARS.

The bed is EMPTY.

INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Janet, groggy, walks in, then STOPS.

SURPRISED to see...

Neil, with Rick and Mark at the kitchen table, huddled over a
PAPER EARTH... pushing a PAPER GEMINI towards a PAPER AGENA.

58.
NEIL
Before we can dock, we have to meet
up with the Agena in space.
RICK

That’s called rendezvous.
Neil nods.

Then notices Janet in the door.
Hey.
Hey.

Watching them.

Neil flicks off the engines and the men are JOLTED FORWARD,
tossed into MICROGRAVITY. Dave lets out a GRUNT... as a

Engines off, it’s eerily QUIET. Dave takes a breath, glances
out the window. The world’s UPSIDE DOWN, sky at his feet,
horizon ABOVE his head. STRUCK, he nudges Neil...
Neil looks up. It’s the view from the X-15, but FOUR TIMES
HIGHER. PUSH IN on Neil’s eyes, a surprising SENSE OF WONDER.

PAT
I couldn’t eat when Ed was up there,

She makes a face at Morse.

Janet laughs, then looks to Ed.

It’s kind of you to come.
Neil would appreciate it.

I’m sure

ED
Are you?
No.

JANET
But I’m glad you’re here.

Neil HITS the thrusters. POP, POP! The craft SWINGS left and
Neil lets go. Dave eyes the instruments, jots down residuals.
DAVE SCOTT
Did you burn at 26:10?

NEIL
That - that’s right. It was

STAR in the window. Dave follows his gaze.
NEIL

DAVE SCOTT
Could be.
But Dave grabs a sextant, takes a reading... and SMILES.
LOVELL (COMMS)
Gemini 8, this is Houston
Capcom. Do you read?

DAVE SCOTT (INTO COMMS)
Gemini 8 to Houston, we’ve
got a visual on the Agena.

DAVE SCOTT
Ah, shit...

NEIL
I need a readout.

DAVE SCOTT
4 forward, 2 left... wait, needles
are wandering. 12 forward, 1 right?
The instruments OSCILLATE, two DIFFERENT headings.

Fuck.

NEIL
We’ll burn the closed loop, 12 and
1. Ready? 3, 2, 1... burn.
Neil HITS the thrusters again. POP POP... the Gemini gives
chase... and the Agena SWINGS into the window.
DAVE SCOTT
There! We’re swinging into... shit!
Dave SQUINTS, BLINDED by the sun, appearing over the horizon.
He shields his eyes, turns up the instrument panel lights.
NEIL
I need range and rate.

DAVE SCOTT
6,000 feet, 31 feet per
second, going too fast!

Neil SQUINTS at the Agena growing in the window... and HITS
the braking thrusters. POP! POP! POP! Steam SHOOTS OUT in
front of us, slowing the Gemini...
DAVE SCOTT
19 feet per second... 3,400 feet...
2,880 feet, you need to slow down!
THE AGENA SWINGS UP OUT OF THE WINDOW AGAIN! Fuck! Neil hits
the braking thrusters again, FIGHTING to slow down...
DAVE SCOTT

feet...

NEIL
Put in a little to the left.

Dave adjusts the dial. The Agena SWINGS in the window, LIT UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE IN THE DAYLIGHT. HOVERING in full view.
DAVE SCOTT
God, that’s amazing! Outstanding

Neil looks up.

Again a touch of that CHILDLIKE WONDER.

Neil flies the Gemini, a LIGHTNESS to him. The grit of

Dave SMILES at Neil's atypical enthusiasm as he moves the
Gemini ever closer to the Agena...

pen, sees Neil’s pulled out two PACKETS. DAY 1, MEAL B.
DAVE SCOTT
No thanks, I want to prep the E.V.A.

We should eat.
It’s an order. Neil holds a packet up to a nozzle on the side

Sunlight FLASHES off the windows, SMASHING US BACK INTO -INT. GEMINI VIII COCKPIT - SAME TIME
Sunlight BLAZES intermittently, a STROBE LIGHT on the ephemera
flying across the cabin. It’s DIZZYING...
FUCCI (COMMS)
They seem to have a stuck thruster.
Dave’s eyes ROLL BACK. Neil clocks it, tries to focus on the
console, searching for an answer. The sound FADES to the
SLOSHING in Neil’s ears as we SMASH INTO -NEIL'S POV. He’s starting to GRAY OUT. He SHUTS his eyes and
OPENS them... everything SPINS AROUND HIM at nauseating speed,
it’s almost as if he’s not moving at all...
Now the sloshing in his ears FADES to EERIE QUIET... and we
hear THE AWFUL WHIR of KAREN'S COBALT MACHINE.
Neil SHUTS HIS EYES again... trying to PUSH the sound away...
in the dark, he faintly HEARS a HISSING...
NEIL
OAMS thruster must be stuck...

74.
Neil’s eyes FLY OPEN and he YANKS the breakers, CUTTING ALL
POWER. It goes BLACK, save for the flickering sunlight...
Neil’s eyes TICK over GAUGES. OAMS DROP but ROLL RATE keeps
RISING. PUSH IN ON Neil’s eyes, TWITCHING and SMASH INTO -NEIL'S POV. A BLUR. The fuzzy roll rate needle inches past
500°/second. Neil’s eyes start to roll back and...
IT GOES DARK... Karen’s cobalt machine grows LOUDER...
Neil FORCES his eyes open... they DART across the controls...
searching for an answer, a way out...
...when he looks overhead and spots a RED CONTROL.
NEIL
Initiate RCS squibs.

Dave.

Dave!

Neil shakes Dave, pulling him awake.
FUCCI (COMMS)
Gemini 8, CSQ, come in...
Dave, GROGGY, gets it.

NEIL
We need a rocket to stop the
spin. The Re-entry rockets...

He reaches for the squibs.

NEIL
On my mark! 3, 2, 1, now!
Dave blows the squibs and Neil REACHES OVER HIS HEAD, flicks
on the re-entry control system. NOTHING HAPPENS. Shit.
NEIL
Didn’t fire.

Re-Arm.

Dave!

Dave, struggling to stay conscious, resets.
NEIL
On my mark... 3, 2, 1, now.
Dave re-arms as Neil again reaches up and... BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
The re-entry boosters FIRE, SPINNING the capsule FASTER...
Neil GRIPS the thruster, BATTLES to stabilize the ship as Dave
FADES. Neil’s eyes TICK to the roll rate. 525, 530, 530...
the needle HOLDS. Is it working? PUSH IN ON Neil, FORCING
HIMSELF to stay conscious, WILLING the needle to FALL...
FUCCI (COMMS)
Gemini 8, CSQ, come in.

Gemini 8?

As Neil, struggling, STARTS TO FADE, we SMASH TO --

Then, faintly...

DAVE (COMMS)
...regaining control... RCS

CONRAD
Motherfucker.

As the group lets out a collective breath, SMASH BACK TO -INT. GEMINI VIII COCKPIT - SAME TIME
Dave, foggy, unsettled, watches Neil calmly pulsing the RCS,
eyes on the DROPPING roll rate gauge... 300°... 250°... 200°...
NEIL
Keep an eye on our RCS fuel.
Dave nods, eyes the fuel gauge. The sun stops strobing, the
flight plans stop whipping about the cabin...
8, CSQ.

Okay.

FUCCI (COMMS)
How are you doing?

FUCCI (COMMS)
Everything’s okay.

DAVE (INTO COMMS)
We are pulsing the RCS pretty
slowly so we don’t-- it’s all
roll right, we are trying to
kill our roll rate.
DAVE
(to Neil)
You believe this guy?

NEIL
Move us back to one ring.
Off Neil, CUT BACK TO -INT. MCC - SAME TIME
Hodge leans in.

76.
HODGE (INTO COMMS)
CSQ, Flight. Find out how
much RCS fuel he has used.

FUCCI (COMMS)
Roger. Gemini 8, CSQ. How
much RCS have you used?

KRAFT
(to the MPAD guys)
I want emergency landing options.
Hodge and Deke both turn to Kraft, surprised.
DEKE
What about the E.V.A. and -Kraft heads off.

KRAFT
We gotta get them home.

As Deke REELS, Ed walks up.

ED
Jan’s outside.
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MCC - SAME TIME
CLOSE ON Jan waiting by the door. In her eyes, intense ANGER
and WORRY. A long beat... then Deke walks out with Ed.
ED
Neil’s okay.
DEKE
The ship’s stable, he’ll be all
right, Jan. I need you to go home.
JANET
(processes, then)
Fine. Turn the box back on.
DEKE
I’ll see what I can -DEKE
There’s a security protocol,
I can’t just --

JANET
Turn it back on now.

Bullshit.

JANET

DEKE
Jan. You have to trust me, we have
this under control.
JANET
All these goddamn protocols and
procedures to make it seem like...
(MORE)

77.
JANET (CONT'D)
like it’s ‘under control.’ You're a
bunch of boys making models from
balsa wood, you don’t have anything
under control.
TEARS WELL...

Embarrassed and ANGRY, she STALKS OFF.

DEKE
Take her home, will ya?
ED
What do we say to the press?
Deke doesn’t follow.
ED
The Life guy, Morse, he was
with Jan, he leaked it to --

PAO (O.C.)
Deke, I need a statement.

The Public Affairs Officer RUNS up.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER
We’re getting calls from the
networks, the papers, local news...
Shit.

Off Deke, CUT BACK TO --

INT. GEMINI VIII COCKPIT - SAME TIME
It's quiet, a checklist floating calmly, the roll stopped.
FUCCI (COMMS)
8, Flight’s told me to relay that
they're looking into 6 or 7 dash 3
area at this time. Please enter reentry Module 4 in the ATM computer.
Dave hesitates, realizing they're terminating the flight.
Neil just pulls out a map, surveys the landing area.

But

NEIL
Right in the middle. Okinawa. That
was the third choice, remote areas.
(then)
I’d like to argue. About the going
home. But I don’t know how we can.
The slightest hint of frustration.

But there’s nothing to do.

DAVE SCOTT
I’ll get started on re-entry.
Downcast, Dave turns to the basic computer, starts punching
numbers in when... POP! POP! POP! Dave STIFFENS, SPINS...

78.
...to find Neil FIRING the OAMS thrusters.
DAVE SCOTT
What are-- we’ll start to spin again!
NEIL
Only way to find the culprit.
Off Dave, UNNERVED, CUT TO -INT. MCC - SAME TIME
The room BUZZES, prepping for re-entry. Gilruth huddles with
Deke and Kraft. A beat. Then we hear Lovell -LOVELL (O.C., INTO COMMS)
8, we’re showing your roll rate back
up to 90 degrees. Confirm? Neil?
The men turn, ALARMED.
Neil?

Hodge and Lovell look TENSE.

LOVELL

NEIL (COMMS)

Checking OAMS, thruster 8

NEIL (COMMS)
This could have been true at the
time of the incident, although we
cannot verify that at this time.
Is he nuts?

Hodge leans into the Comms.
HODGE (OVER COMMS)
Neil, this is Hodge, we’ve got ten
minutes to re-entry, let’s put a pin
in the analysis for now, shall we?

Off the men, we CUT TO -INT. ED’S CORVETTE - NIGHT
Ed drives Janet home. She stares ahead, STILL FURIOUS. Ed
considers talking, thinks better of it. A beat, then he turns
onto their street. We see the HORDE of PRESS. It’s GROWN.
VARIOUS PRESS (PRELAP)
Mrs. Armstrong? Janet?

VARIOUS PRESS (PRELAP)
Can we get a photo? Jan?

INT. LIVING ROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - HOUSTON - SAME TIME
Ed PUSHES into the house with Janet, press calling out after
them until Ed SHUTS THE DOOR. The press falls back.

79.
As Jan recovers, Ed glances at Pat, on the sofa with the
kids... watching Adam West’s BATMAN. OBLIVIOUS. Ed smiles...
when the show is INTERRUPTED by an ABC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
PETER JENNINGS (ON TV)
We’ve interrupted our regular
program due to the emergency
return of Gemini 8...
SCARED, Rick looks to Janet.

Mom?

RICK
At a loss, she walks into --

INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - HOUSTON - CONTINUOUS
Janet pours herself a glass of water. She starts to lift it,
but her hand is SHAKING. Janet tries to settle herself...
...but she can’t. The glass shakes even MORE VIOLENTLY, until
Janet has no choice but to set it down.
As Janet leans against the sink, STRUGGLING, we PRELAP-LOVELL (COMMS, PRELAP)

I’ll do it manually.

Dave looks UNSURE, but Neil reaches for the throttle.

Retro Rocket Squibs - Arm.

Okay.

Neil FIRES the Retro-rockets... he and Dave are SLAMMED into
their seats as the spaceship HURTLES down towards the earth...

80.
DAVE SCOTT (INTO COMMS)
Props off. Retro-power, safe. Retrojett, safe. Lock restraint harness.
Neil’s harness won't lock. Frustrated, he JAMS the buckle
together... RESTRICTING his right arm. Neil grimaces as
sunlight streams in, the horizon at the top of the window.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I keep thinking there’s something
we’ve forgotten about...
Neil’s uncharacteristically ANTSY.

It makes Dave NERVOUS.

DAVE SCOTT (INTO COMMS)
We did everything, far as I know.
If not, it’s too late.
The atmosphere GRABS HOLD, G forces INCREASING. The heat
CONSUMES them, the plasma GLOWING PINK in the window...
As Neil and Dave SWEAT and STRAIN against it all, we -SMASH TO BLACK.
GILRUTH (O.C., OVER BLACK)
Gemini 8 saw two complex vehicles
launched on the same day, on time...

Low, Gilruth, Kraft, Deke and ARMY BRASS at a long table.
Neil and Dave sit across from them.
GEORGE LOW
Neil, the board would like to focus
on the malfunction.
We hear CLACKING, spot a STENOGRAPHER. It’s a FORMAL MISSION
REVIEW. And judging by Low’s tone, Neil's job is on the line.
GEORGE LOW
Can you walk us through the decision
to separate from the Agena?
As Neil considers, we SMASH BACK TO -THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

A HOUSTON POST reporter.

HOUSTON POST REPORTER
You mentioned the rate of revolution
was more than once a second. How
near were you to being unconscious?
NEIL
We didn’t have any specific
difficulty in observing the panel.
HOUSTON POST REPORTER
You hadn’t begun to gray out or
anything like that?
Off Neil, HESITATING, not in his element, SMASH BACK TO -THE FORMAL MISSION REVIEW.
GEORGE LOW
Why didn’t you use the Agena to
stabilize the combined craft?
NEIL
We did. This was not effective.
And, as I’ve said, we initially
assumed there was some anomaly in
the Agena control system.

Okay, but have you really ruled out
the possibility that you...

A LONG beat, then Low stands.

GEORGE LOW
Thanks, Neil. There’s a lot to

INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOME - DAY
CLOSE ON Neil on the phone.

As AGITATED as we’ve seen him.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
It’s, it’s, it’s sensationalist.
It’s not appropriate, it’s not an
appropriate title for the piece!
Neil holds an ADVANCED COPY of a LIFE MAGAZINE article: “Our
Wild Ride in Space!” by Neil Armstrong.
NEIL (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
I’m not interested in how the other
magazines are framing the story!
Now we see the Wall Street Journal on the kitchen table. A
headline below the fold: Moon Race: Can’t Machines Do It?
NEIL (INTO PHONE)
Well then... then maybe my name
shouldn’t be on the damn article!
Neil SLAMS down the phone.
JANET
Neil?
But he walks out.

Janet, plating dinner, looks up.

Off Janet, CONCERNED, PRELAP a DOORBELL --

EXT. ED WHITE’S HOUSE - DAY
Ed opens the front door.

And finds Janet.

JANET
Can you come over?
ED
Not sure that’s gonna help.
Please.

JANET
She’s insistent. Ed hesitates but Pat, at the door as well,
nudges him. He heads across the yard. Pat offers a smile.
PAT
My sister married a dentist. I used
to wonder what it was like. He’s
home by six every night. And every
three months my sister calls to say
she wishes he weren’t.
Janet manages a laugh.

A beat.

JANET
I keep hoping it’ll be better. If
things go right. When they do.

A LARGE DESK. Covered with SCHEMATICS of the Agena, DATA from
Gemini 8, DIAGRAMS of the Gemini’s sixteen OAMS thrusters.
FIND Neil hunched over it all with an ENGINEER'S PAD. HOLD ON
him, studying the malfunction, working the problem.
We hear
a RUMBLE and Neil looks up... Ed rolls down the stairs.
ED
Back to work?
NEIL
I’m trying to find a way to isolate
a single thruster.
It’s AWKWARD, the fight still not really behind them.

A beat.

ED
I was gonna go over to Dave’s.
No response from Neil.

Ed, giving up, starts to retreat...

NEIL
...I could use a break.
Ed pauses. He and Neil share a look. Detente. WE HEAR the
Second Movement of Dvorak's New World Symphony and CUT TO -INT. KITCHEN, DAVE SCOTT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Neil and Ed sit drinking with Dave Scott. They listen to an 8TRACK, Dvorak washing over them. Off the music -NEIL
Felt a little like that, right?
Being up there?
ED
How much did you have to drink?
Neil tosses a empty beer can at Ed.

Ed laughs.

So does Neil.

DAVE SCOTT
I will say one thing. It’s all I
can think about. Getting back up.
Neil nods.

Ed eyes his beer, an odd look on his face.

He and Deke

For the first Apollo mission?
Ed nods, tentative.

Dave explodes, thrilled for him.

DAVE SCOTT
Holy shit. That’s huge!

NEIL (CONT’D)
That Saturn’s a monster. It’s
gonna be a helluva ride.

Neil’s SMILING, genuinely excited.
DAVE SCOTT
You know Deke wants Gus to be first
one on the moon, so that first team-ED
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
NEIL (CONT’D)
Okay, but it is pretty exciting.

Yeah, Gus is already bitching.

Gus bitching?

You will.

Then he

NEIL
You ever fly an Aeronca?
Sure.

ED
Learned to fly on one.

NEIL
I flew that plane a ton before I
joined the Navy. I used to like
coming down steep on final approach
so I could land early and have time
to roll out...
ED
Bet the Navy instructors loved that.
NEIL
They beat it out of me.
Ed smiles.
NEIL
After Korea, I went back to Purdue.
The flight club had an Aeronca, so
one weekend I flew it home to
Wapakoneta. I put it into a big slip
on final approach like when I was a
kid... I banged the thing so hard on
the landing, it couldn’t fly back.
ED
You crashed an Aeronca? After all
those missions in Korea?
NEIL
Had to take the wings off and haul
it back to Lafayette on a trailer.
ED
I hope none of the coeds saw you.
Ed smiles broadly.

Neil smiles back... then he TIGHTENS.

87.
NEIL
The whole way back, I kept trying to
replay the landing in my head. But
I couldn’t. I hadn’t been paying
attention. It was like riding a
bike so I’d just... I hadn’t been
paying attention.

But Neil isn’t sure.

Off the DOUBT in his eyes, CUT TO --

A long hallway. At the end of it, Neil sits on a folding
chair outside the corner office. TAPPING his foot.
CLOSE ON Neil, SWEATING. Nervous unlike anything we’ve seen.
He scratches his leg. Again. Foot still TAPPING.
At last, the door opens. Deke leans out.

Awkward.

It coulda been a

GILRUTH
You docked, you got your ship home,
this mission was a success. And
we’re gonna treat it that way from

Neil doesn’t show much, but he’s clearly relieved.
GILRUTH
I trust you won’t mind representing
us next month at the White House?
NEIL
Uh, no sir.
Good.

GILRUTH
Then you’re dismissed.

Neil nods, walks out.

Deke follows him into --

INT. HALLWAY, MANNED SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
Neil and Deke walk down the hall.

A beat, then --

NEIL
...I don’t really have to go to the
White House, do I?
Deke glances at him.
DEKE
I know you think this is bullshit,
nobody likes kissing up to those
idiots in D.C. But it’s part of the
job. Especially nowadays.
Off Neil, less than thrilled, CUT TO --

INT. KITCHEN, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - MORNING
Janet holds up a BLUE SUIT.

Irritated.

JANET
Neil Alden Armstrong, you cannot
wear a suit!
Neil, in an APRON, makes pancakes.

PERFECT HALF DOLLARS.

NEIL
It said Black Tie Optional.
JANET
You’re one of three astronauts
representing NASA, Deke specifically
told me it was not optional.
Neil frowns as Ed walks in the front door with a duffle.
ED
Nice apron.

Manly.

JANET
Would you tell him he’s got to wear
a tuxedo to the White House?
ED
I dunno, maybe he should wear the
apron.
NEIL
Don’t you have a plane to catch?
Ed laughs. And notices SCHEMATICS on the table. DIAGRAMS for
the LUNAR LANDING TEST VEHICLE, an odd, free-flying trainer
that’ll simulate lunar gravity. And yes, it’s an update of
the diagram that inspired Neil to join Apollo back on P.19.
ED
Is this the lunar landing Sim?
NEIL
Gene and the folks at FRC have been
having a heck of a time with it.
ED
(off the diagrams, impressed)
It’s completely fly by wire?

90.
NEIL
Does a decent job simulating lunar
gravity but if the electrical system
craps out or you get a good 20 knot
wind, it’s a real hairy deal. Deke
asked me to take a look but I think
the thing’s just too damn dangerous.
ED
This from the ‘Hero of Gemini 8’?
Neil grimaces.
JANET
Don’t get him started again. He’s
been grumbling about the trip all
morning.
NEIL
How ‘bout we trade and I go to the
Cape?
ED
No, you got the guts, you gotta go
enjoy the glory.
INT. BEDROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - LATER
CLOSE ON an OPEN SUITCASE. Socks, underwear and A TUX; packed
METICULOUSLY. Neil adds a dopp kit then hesitates. He picks
it up. Eyes TICKING over the toothbrush, toothpaste...
JANET
You already repacked it.
Neil looks up flustered, AGITATED.

Twice.

Janet moves to him.

JANET
When you meet the President, just
look at his shoes. It’ll be okay.
Neil looks up, nods. Janet leans in, kisses his cheek, starts
to go... but he pulls her back.
NEIL
I, uh, I know I, since I got back...
JANET
It’s okay.
It isn’t really. But she wants to be strong for him. Neil,
VULNERABLE, pulls her in. Holds tight. Off Janet, CUT TO --

INT. LIMOUSINE - LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON Neil.

In a TUXEDO.

Stiff.

Uncomfortable.

PETE CONRAD (O.C.)
Looks like he was born in a tux.
REVERSE to Conrad and Jim Lovell, across from Neil. Conrad
SMIRKS at Neil as the limo stops and the door opens on...
A RED CARPET. REPORTERS line the entrance to THE WHITE HOUSE.
As Pete gets out, WAVING, we HOLD ON Neil... uneasy.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON (PRELAP)
We have never succeeded in freeing
our planet from war.
INT. EAST ROOM, THE WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
CLOSE ON a formal international document: The Treaty on Outer
Space, January 27, 1967. As LBJ’s familiar voice rolls on...
...REVEAL a room of DIGNITARIES. LBJ sits at a signing table.
We’re BEHIND HIM with Neil and the other astronauts.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON (O.C.)
But this treaty means the moon will
serve only the purposes of peace...
and that astronaut and cosmonaut
might meet on the moon as brothers.
LBJ hands a pen to a heavyset AMBASSADOR wearing a SICKLE PIN.
As he moves to sign the treaty, Conrad whispers to the others.
PETE CONRAD
What a load of horseshit.
Neil turns, but before Pete can go on, they’re overwhelmed by
APPLAUSE and FLASHBULBS. As Neil flinches, we FLASH TO -INT. EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATER
Lovell and Neil talk to a Senator.

Neil clings to a beer.

LOVELL
...we’re very bullish on Apollo.
SENATOR
I should hope, given the time we’ve
spent developing it.
Neil looks uncomfortable.

The congressman notices.

92.
SENATOR
Commander Armstrong?

You disagree?

NEIL
We learned to fly sixty years ago.
So if you consider the technological
development in the context of
history -SENATOR
I’m considering it in the context of
taxpayer dollars.
Neil doesn’t know what to say.

Lovell steps in...

LOVELL
So are we, Senator. And between us,
if the capsule passes plugs out,
we’ll have a heck of a launch next
month. I’m sure Mr. Gilruth would
be happy to discuss it in detail.
Lovell leads the Senator across the room to Gilruth... and
away from Neil. Neil awkwardly drifts toward the bar.
He stands there for a moment, totally out of place... when a
PRETTY STAFFER appears at his side with a FLIRTY SMILE.
PRETTY FEMALE STAFFER
Aren’t you someone I should know?
NEIL
...uh, probably not.
She walks off, confused.
CONRAD
We need to get you a stronger drink.
Neil sees Conrad’s beside him.

Conrad waves for a beer.

CONRAD
No stomach for political theater?
NEIL
...that what this is?
CONRAD
We’ve got more troops on the ground
in Vietnam every day. You think LBJ
wants astronaut and cosmonaut to
‘meet on the moon as brothers’?

93.
NEIL
Then why sign the treaty?
CONRAD
You can’t lose a race you don’t run.
(off Neil)
We’re still neck and neck with the
Russians, and for what? ICBM’s have
made space irrelevant, militarily.
Why break the bank on the moon when
you could spend it in Saigon?
NEIL
...you think he’d just drop Apollo?
CONRAD
Oh yeah. If LBJ wasn’t from Texas
we’d already be dead.
Neil stares at him.
CONRAD
Jesus, Armstrong, where’ve you been?
Did you see the polling on Apollo?
No.

ARMSTRONG
I didn’t.

CONRAD
Well, it’s not good.
LOVELL
Knock it off, Pete.
Lovell walks up, nods to the bartender for a beer.
LOVELL
We launch Apollo, nobody’s going to
cut our funding. That shiny new
capsule’s gonna have every kid in
the country dreaming about a trip to
the moon.
CONRAD
That shiny new capsule hasn’t passed
plugs out.
LOVELL
Talk to me in an hour.
He takes a drink, then leans into Neil so Pete can’t hear him.
LOVELL
Any word on plugs out?

EXT./INT. GANTRY ELEVATOR, LAUNCH TOWER, PAD 34, CAPE - DAY
Deke rides up the elevator with Gus, Ed and ROGER CHAFFEE, 32,
suited up, carrying helmets. Ed looks down the side of the
SATURN 1B ROCKET, at the cape stretching out below. THRILLED.
ED
Pretty, isn’t she?
Yes, we're 40 STORIES UP, scaling a rocket FOUR TIMES THE SIZE
OF GEMINI’S TITAN and it’s SPECTACULAR. But only Ed notices.
GUS
I think the 21st is pushing it.
DEKE
The Russians have already tested the
Soyuz. Once they get the Proton-K
off the ground -GUS
I got it. But if the capsule’s not
ready, it’s not ready. I’m not
going up there in a lemon.
No.

DEKE
We wouldn’t let you.

The elevator stops. Short. A FOOT below ADJUSTABLE LEVEL 8
and the GLEAMING APOLLO CAPSULE sitting atop the Saturn. As
Gus SHOOTS Deke a look, pulls himself up, we CUT TO -INT. THE WHITE ROOM, ADJUSTABLE LEVEL 8, PAD 34 - MOMENTS LATER
PAD LEADER GUENTER WENDT oversees techs removing thick power
cords from the new APOLLO CAPSULE. It’s very shiny indeed.
GUENTER WENDT
Power up the capsule’s internal
batteries for plugs out. Closing
hatches now.
Through the hatch, we see Ed, helmet now on, pushes the inner
hatch towards us SEALING THE CAPSULE. We feel the excitement
as techs close the middle hatch above it and we go...
CLOSE ON RATCHETS. Tightening six different latches.
from RATCHET to RATCHET until...

CUT

TECH
Ablative hatch closed. Closing the
boost protective cover.
They close the cover, start the process again.

INT. APOLLO COCKPIT, PAD 34 - SAME TIME
CLOSE ON another ratchet tightening a latch.
ED (O.C.)
That’s all of ‘em.
FIND Ed in the familiar Apollo cockpit. He glances at the
OTHER FIVE LOCKED LATCHES, puts away the ratchet.
GUS (INTO COMMS)
Ready for oxygen purge.
We hear the HISS of oxygen... and SNIPPETS of conversation
over Comms. Gus, beside Ed, hits the comms button.
GUS (INTO COMMS)
Guys, we’ve got an open mic.
A beat.

LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
Uh, let’s hold the countdown.

The crew looks annoyed.
DEKE (COMMS)
Sorry guys, we’ll get this squared.

GUS (INTO COMMS)
How are we gonna get to the
moon if we can’t talk between
two buildings?

LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
...Gus, we didn’t get that.

As Gus, pissed, shakes his head, we CUT TO -INT. HALLWAY, GEORGETOWN INN - WASHINGTON, DC - SAME TIME
An elevator DINGS.

Lovell, Conrad and Neil get off.

PETE CONRAD
I’m gonna get outta this monkey suit
and head to the bar.
I’m in.

LOVELL
Neil?

NEIL
I think I’ll check in with the Cape.
PETE CONRAD
You hell raiser, you.
Neil peels off.

96.
INT. ROOM, GEORGETOWN INN, WASHINGTON, DC - MOMENTS LATER
Neil walks in, neatly hangs his jacket in the closet. He
pulls at his tie, sits on the bed and reaches for the phone,
DIALING then taking off his shoes as he waits for...
Rocco.

PETRONE (OVER PHONE)
NEIL (INTO PHONE)
It’s Neil. How’s it going there?
PETRONE (OVER PHONE)
We’re on a hold. Glitch in the
Comms, about ten away, I think.
Huh.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
Okay. How’s the capsule look?

PETRONE (OVER PHONE)
Oh, she’s a beaut.
Neil can’t help but smile.

Excited for Apollo.

For Ed.

PETRONE
Happy to give you guys a holler a
bit later with a status report.
NEIL (INTO PHONE)
That’d be great. Thanks, Rocco.
Neil hangs up, grabs the remote... a Zenith ‘SPACE COMMANDER.’
He blinks at the name... then snaps on the TV and settles in.
INT. APOLLO COCKPIT, PAD 34 - LATER
Ed looks over a manual, clearly BORED.
DEKE (COMMS)
A few more minutes, we’ve
just about got it sorted.

GUS (INTO COMMS)
Shit, we’re gonna be here all
night.

ED (INTO COMMS, to Roger)
He’ll turn the corner. In half an
hour he’ll be singing Sinatra.
GUS (INTO COMMS, to Ed)
Stop screwing around, wouldya?

97.
DEKE (COMMS)
Easy, everyone just cool it.

TECH (COMMS)
I got a surge in the AC Bus 2
Voltage.

GUS (INTO COMMS)
Get the damn comms working
and we’ll cool it.
LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
Try resetting the meter.

Gus, happy to have something to do, looks over the gauges.
GUS (INTO COMMS)
Rog, you see anything on the dials?
Chaffee turns to look and notices a SMALL FLAME on the floor.
Before he can react... the flame JUMPS.
Hey!

CHAFFEE (INTO COMMS)
The flame FLASHES through the cockpit, FIRE BLAZING around all
three of them. Ed and Gus react -- it’s frighting, but they
stay CALM, HUSTLING through evacuation procedures...
Ed reaches for the hatch... the latches are TIGHT. He grabs a
ratchet, STRUGGLES to loosen a latch, but his arm is ENGULFED
by fire. He KEEPS WORKING... even as his suit starts to MELT.
Ed GRIMACES. The latch isn’t budging. His eyes DART to the
other five latches. As he starts to PANIC, SMASH TO -INT. BLOCKHOUSE, PAD 34, CAPE CANAVERAL - SAME TIME
A FAR VIEW of the CAPSULE from 400 feet below.
Gus?

It looks fine.

PETRONE (INTO COMMS)
Can you hear us up there?

LAUNCH DIRECTOR ROCCO PETRONE, 40, eyes the capsule on the B&W
MONITOR. We’re in a makeshift LAUNCH COMMAND at the base of
the rocket. Deke walks up with a cup of coffee.
DEKE
Comms are still out?
TECH
Should have been fixed by now.
The tech at the comms shrugs.
PETRONE (INTO COMMS)
Gus, can you hear --

Petrone tries again.
ED (COMMS)
We got a fire in the cockpit!

98.
Petrone pauses, eyes the monitor... as the hatch window LIGHTS
UP, turning WHITE. Deke remains calm.
Okay.

DEKE
Get them out of there.

PETRONE (INTO COMMS)
Hey crew, can you egress at this
time? Confirm it.
No response.

Deke takes the Comms.
DEKE (INTO COMMS)
Guenter, get in there and help them.

Deke looks up.

High above, techs move towards the capsule.

PETRONE (INTO COMMS)
Crew did we get verification?
Can you egress at --

CHAFFEE (COMMS)
We have a bad fire! We’re
burning up! We’re burning...

They hear Chaffee SCREAM. It’s PRIMAL, HEART-STOPPING.
now CONCERNED, looks up. A beat, then -BOOM!!!

Deke,

The capsule RUPTURES, SMOKE POURING OUT...

Everyone in the blockhouse PALES. Deke and Petrone stare,
incredulous as the techs above fall back.
PETRONE (INTO COMMS)
Pad leader, are you able to
hear them? Guenter --

GUENTER WENDT (COMMS)
All the smoke, we can’t...

Deke, UNNERVED, takes the comms, tries to remain professional.
DEKE (INTO COMMS)
Gus, can you hear us? Gus?
But there's NO RESPONSE.

Off Deke --

INT. LIVING ROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Janet reads, Rick and Mark play on floor. A quiet moment...
until the phone RINGS. Janet stands, picks up the phone.
Hello?

JANET (INTO PHONE)
DEKE (OVER PHONE)
Janet, it’s Deke. There’s been an
accident at the Cape. We... we
don’t know how bad yet. Would you
mind going over to Pat’s?

99.
Off Janet, PALE, SMASH TO -INT. WHITE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
The kids play as Janet helps Pat carry in grocery bags.
PAT
Thank goodness you swung by, I’d
have a car full of melted ice pops.
Pat smiles, chipper, when the doorbell RINGS.
PAT
You mind tossing the rest of the
perishables into the fridge?
JANET
Of course not.
Pat exits. Janet puts the milk in the fridge... when she
hears an AWFUL, GUT WRENCHING, ANIMALISTIC SCREAM.
Jan freezes.

As the sound RIPPLES through her, SMASH TO --

INT. ROOM, GEORGETOWN INN - WASHINGTON, DC - MOMENTS LATER
Neil as we left him, on his bed, tux still on, watching TV.
And waiting. A beat. Then the phone RINGS. Neil grabs it.
Hello?
Neil.
Hey.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
DEKE (OVER PHONE)
NEIL (INTO PHONE)
How’d it go?

DEKE (OVER PHONE)
(pause)
Not great, there was... an accident.
No easy way to say this... Ed, Gus
and Roger, they’re, they’re gone.
Neil sits there.

Blinks.

Not following.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
I don’t understand. It was a test.
DEKE (OVER PHONE)
We think there was a wiring issue.
NEIL
I don’t... I don’t follow.

100.
DEKE
There was a fire and, and we’ll get
to the bottom of it. Right now we
need you guys to lay low. The press
is all over this, Senator Mondale’s
going to call for an investigation,
we don’t want you to have to deal
with any of that, okay? Neil?
Yes.

NEIL (INTO PHONE)
Okay. Thanks.

Neil hangs up. A beat. Neil sits, silent. Blank. He lifts
the phone, as if to make a call... and holds the receiver, the
dial tone PULSING, growing LOUDER, until...
...he SMASHES the receiver on the cradle.
Again.
And again.
And AGAIN.
Harder now. Until he’s smashing the receiver on the cradle
with such FORCE...
...that the phone CRACKS... the nightstand BUCKLES.
And still he continues.

Pain and rage pouring out...

He keeps POUNDING the phone... UNTIL it’s PULVERIZED... UNTIL
the nightstand SPLITS... UNTIL his fingers, his hand starts to
BLEED... UNTIL at last he runs out of steam.
And pauses. PANTING. His face contorted... his eyes TICKING
to his hand. BADLY MAULED, blood DRIPPING down the phone...
We hold on him for an awful beat and then we...
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
EXT. ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE, HOUSTON, TX - DAY
TIGHT ON NEIL’S FACE. Eyes focused, but EMOTIONLESS. DEAD.
A stark contrast to the jagged hand-held camera. And a stark
contrast to the Neil we last saw. Wounds buried, yet there on
the surface. Scar tissue, invisible to most, less so to us.
Ellington Air Force Base
May 6, 1968

101.
JIM LOVELL (COMMS)
Winds are pretty rough today, keep
an eye on your translation rates.
PULL BACK to find Neil exposed to the elements, strapped into
THE LUNAR LANDING TEST VEHICLE. A MESS of METAL PIPES with a
COCKPIT. The realization of the DIAGRAMS we saw on P.101.
JIM LOVELL (COMMS)
Approaching altitude,
drifting east.
Copy.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Correcting.

Neil hits the thruster and a BURST of peroxide spits out to
our right. As it pushes the LLTV left we PULL BACK FURTHER...
Neil’s HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE GROUND in a contraption that
doesn’t look like it should fly. Jesus. The camera does a
WILD 360 around the belching craft then... PUSHES IN on Neil.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Five hundred feet. Switching to
lunar mode and starting descent.
Dead-eyed, but alert, Neil hits a button and starts to guide
the LLTV to a landing. Thrusters POP and HISS; the craft
ROCKS and BUCKS, but Neil’s eyes REMAIN STEADY on his gauges.
CLOSE ON the ALTITUDE GAUGE: 400... 300... 200 feet.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Final landing approach.
Neil calmly pilots the LLTV down through 100 feet... When the
bottom FALLS OUT. The craft starts to DROP RAPIDLY.
Neil PULLS on the thruster, but the LLTV doesn't respond.
JIM LOVELL (COMMS)
Increase altitude! Neil!
Neil HITS the thrusters again... The craft SHOOTS UP to 200
feet... then ROLLS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT!! It’s terrifying.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Attitude control degrading.
Steam SPITS from the thrusters; peroxide particles burn Neil's
neck. UNFAZED, he tries to correct the roll... only to have
the craft go UP ON IT’S SIDE LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE!
Neil quickly PULLS the throttle right, but now the LLTV SWAYS
BACK EVEN FURTHER ON THE OTHER SIDE!! HOLY FUCK!!

102.
JIM LOVELL (COMMS)
Your translation rates are too high!
You’ve gotta bail out! Neil, do you
hear me, you have to bail out now!
But Neil, eyes DARK, barely registers this.
FADES... then THE SOUND DROPS OUT ENTIRELY.

Lovell’s voice

PUSH IN TIGHT ON NEIL’S FACE IN TOTAL SILENCE.
We clock the INTENSITY, HARD and COLD, the DARKNESS in his
eyes... MORE FRIGHTENING than anything happening around him.
A long beat... then Neil’s eyes TICK DOWN.
We see the ground RUSHING UP to meet the craft.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I gotta go.
LIGHTENING FAST Neil PULLS the ejection handle.

BOOM!!!

SOUND COMES RUSHING BACK as the Ejection Seat EXPLODES out of
the LLTV, TOSSING Neil a hundred feet up into the air!!!
POP POP POP! Neil’s parachute unfurls, stabilizing us just in
time to see the LLTV CRASH below... and BURST INTO FLAMES.
Off Neil, staring down at the FIERY BLAZE OF METAL, PRELAP -DEKE (PRELAP)
The vehicle is not safe.
EXT./INT. DEKE’S OFFICE, MSC, HOUSTON - NIGHT
Kraft and Deke argue with Neil.
DEKE
We need to shut it down, Neil.
NEIL
It’s the best simulation we have.
KRAFT
Yes, but -NEIL
Landing in lunar gravity is the most
substantial hurdle left; the vehicle
gives us the best approximation of
flight in a lunar environment.

103.
KRAFT
Okay, but you and the others are too
valuable to risk on a fly by wire
system with no backup.
NEIL
The ejection seat is the backup.
DEKE
Neil, the political fallout
from another accident -DEKE
You could have died, Neil.
DEKE
A split second more and --

NEIL
That’s what you’re worried
about?
NEIL
But I didn’t.
NEIL
We need to fail!

Deke REACTS, but Neil’s too far gone to notice...
NEIL
That’s the point. These tests aren’t
about getting it right, they’re
about knowledge. We fail and we
learn and we fail and we learn and
it’s the only goddamn reason we’ve
gotten this far. We have to keep
failing here so we don’t fail there.
KRAFT
But at what cost?
NEIL
Whatever it takes.
A beat.

Off the tense standoff, we PRELAP -KTRH ANCHOR (ON RADIO)
...the NASA press release said the
ejection took place at 200 feet...

INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - NIGHT
Janet stands by the stove, cooking. Or rather she was.
she LISTENS to the radio on the sill. PALE.
KTRH ANCHOR (ON RADIO)
...but eyewitnesses said Armstrong
was much lower. Senator Mondale was
particularly vocal on the loss of
the multi-million dollar machine...

Now

104.
The door opens. Neil walks in, sees dinner isn’t on the
table, starts to head towards his office when...
JANET
Are you okay?
Neil stops, turns.

IMPENETRABLE.

NEIL
It’s always a sad day when you lose
a machine.
It’s hard to take; Janet needs more, but Neil’s distracted.
His eyes TICK to the radio.
SENATOR MONDALE (ON RADIO)
...we’ve spent more than we did on
the Manhattan project, we’ve put our
most talented young men at risk, and
what are the odds of success?
Neil STIFFENS. Janet, visibly upset, turns back to the stove.
The radio seems to grow LOUDER.
SENATOR MONDALE (ON RADIO)
Is it any wonder that a majority of
the public no longer feel the space
program is worth it?
The front door SLAMS.

Janet turns.

Neil’s gone.

INT. WOLFIE’S RESTAURANT, CAPE KENNEDY - DAY
A 60’s diner. Neil eats alone, studying data from his LLTV
crash. He jots down a note and takes a bite of steak which
he’s cut into CUBES (so he can eat while he works).
Neil’s so engrossed, he doesn’t hear THE MUSIC. Hendrix. All
Along the Watchtower. As it rolls past him, we RACK FOCUS to
a table of YOUNG HIPPIES. Facial hair, tie-dye, a box radio.
A GIRL in Joplin sunglasses (think Penny Lane) STARES at Neil.
His cut up steak. His close cropped hair. His thin black
tie. He’s a walking ANACHRONISM.
The girl points.

The others SNICKER.

Neil doesn’t notice.

PUSH IN on him, OBLIVIOUS. A man alone, out of time, but
nonetheless hell bent, single minded, DETERMINED. His eyes
TICKING insistently, his focus UNWAVERING. That is, until...
A FILE is dropped in front of Neil. CONFIDENTIAL. Neil looks
up, finds Deke. Who sits, nods at the file. Neil opens it.

105.
GRAINY PHOTOGRAPHS of a HUGE ROCKET.

With RUSSIAN MARKINGS.

DEKE
It was unmanned. 2 million pounds
of thrust. It circled the moon.
Dammit.
NEIL
How long until we test the first
stage of Saturn Five?
DEKE
Public support for Apollo has been
dropping like a brick since the
fire, Congress won’t fund us to be
second best. Shit, we move too
slow, they won’t fund us at all.
Neil REALIZES...
NEIL
We’re testing all 3 stages at once.
Deke nods.

Holy shit.

Even Neil is struck.

DEKE
Apollo 8 will attempt to duplicate
what the Soviets did. Lovell’s in
command. You’re the backup. Kraft
may not have been impressed by your
tirade, but Gilruth was. At least
my version of it.
(standing)
Get the new LLTV online asap. You,
Conrad and Borman’ll rotate. If we
actually manage to get there, one of
you is gonna have to land.
Deke leaves. Neil processes. He’s one of three men who might
land on the moon. Jesus. A beat, then we PULL BACK...
HIGH AND WIDE on the DINER. The Hendrix, the hippies and the
anonymous astronaut... who very well might make history.
We take in the oddity of the tableau, then CUT TO -INT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING (VAB), KSC - DAY
A crane lifts the ENORMOUS SECOND STAGE of a SATURN ROCKET.
We’re in the 8-acre, 526-foot-tall hanger that is the V.A.B.
MIKE COLLINS
Jesus, that’s a big mother.

106.
MIKE COLLINS (38, shrewd) stands with Neil, Buzz, Lovell, Dave
and a few others as the crane sets the second stage atop the
first, which sits on the massive APOLLO CRAWLER-TRANSPORTER.
BUZZ
Gonna be some kind of explosion if
it goes up.
(off the others)
The MPAD guys said there’s a twenty
percent chance.
LOVELL
I’m gonna get some water.
Lovell, a little pale, heads off towards the office.
MIKE COLLINS
Shit, Buzz, he’s gotta fly that
thing.
NEIL
It’s in the briefing pack.
Dave turns towards Neil, surprised.

And a bit AGITATED.

DAVE SCOTT
You don’t think that’s a problem?
This is exactly the kinda rush job
that led to the fire.
Neil doesn’t respond.

Dave, annoyed, walks off after Lovell.

BUZZ
He’s just pissed off cause he lost
the lunar lottery.
What?

ANOTHER ASTRONAUT
What are you talking about?

BUZZ
The LLTV rotation. The LLTV’s
unstable, the only guys they’ll risk
on it are the ones who actually
might land. 3 commanders, 2 pilots.
Neil doesn’t like this talk; neither do the others.
MIKE COLLINS
You think you’re going to the moon?
BUZZ
The landing’s been up for grabs ever
since Gus and Ed died.
(MORE)

107.
BUZZ (CONT'D)
If 8 makes it there and back, 10, 11
or 12 is going to be the one.
That’s Borman, Conrad or Neil. With
Anders or me piloting.
(off their reaction)
What? I’m just saying what you’re
all thinking out loud.
NEIL
Maybe you shouldn’t.
It’s SHARP. Buzz turns, surprised. Before he can respond,
the men see Lovell WAVING from the office. SMASH TO -INT. OFFICE, VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING, KSC - LATER

sits at a desk in front of an ABC camera crew.

Bergman

JULES BERGMAN (TO CAMERA)
...Astronauts Borman, Lovell and
Anders are in their command module,
the first manned spacecraft to leave
Earth’s orbit...
The camera starts MOVING, PUSHING PAST Bergman to a HUGE FIELD
OF HUMANITY; Apollo posters, bell bottoms, Sgt. Pepper... it’s
Woodstock for geeks. In the middle of it all, a NASA VAN
rolls from the launch pad towards mission control. CUT INTO -INT. NASA VAN (MOVING) - CAPE KENNEDY - SAME TIME
Neil, Buzz and Fred Haise, the Apollo 8 backups, sit in back.
Buzz stares out the window, riveted, focusing on...
PROTESTORS. We note the banners: Is space more important than
our poor? Our boys in Vietnam? Buzz sees the ANGER.
Nuts.

BUZZ
Just nuts, huh?

Buzz turns to Neil, reading a manual. COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS.
Off Buzz, clearly not understanding Neil at all, we CUT TO -INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH CONTROL CENTER - EARLY MORN
CLOSE ON Neil's eyes, now staring through the ENORMOUS WINDOWS
of Launch Control at Apollo 8, steaming on the pad. In the
b/g, the launch director runs through flight checks.
Even at a distance, the Saturn is HUGE. And at 7.5 million
pounds of thrust, it’s the most powerful rocket in history.
FIDO (O.C.)
T minus 1 minute.

As the flight crew sounds off, Deke joins Neil and looks down
the line.... at Dave’s jaw tensing, at Buzz scratching at his
neck, at Mike biting a nail... and then at Neil. Still.
LAUNCH DIRECTOR
Final go, no go. EECOM?
I’m go.

EECOM ENGINEER
Launch commit.

The whole room QUIETS as the call continues.
FIDO
T minus ten, nine, eight, seven,
main engine start...
We SEE the engines FIRE before we HEAR them... Lights and
ceiling tiles begin to SHAKE. A couple come CRASHING DOWN.
FIDO
Four, three, two, one, ignition...
We hear the engines ROAR. A TSUNAMI OF THUNDER SLAMS into the
windows, BUCKLING the big one in front of Neil. Holy Shit!!!
A number of men HIT THE DECK. Even Neil FLINCHES...
But the window HOLDS.

And Apollo 8 lifts off the pad.

There's something TERRIFYING about the POWER of the big
rocket, the SPEED at which it hurtles into the sky...
...but as it continues to rise, there’s scattered CLAPPING...
the launch is successful. And momentarily, everyone starts to
CHEER. Everyone, that is, but Neil. Who heads for the door.
Off Deke, CLOCKING THIS, we CUT TO -INT. BATHROOM, KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON Neil washing his hands.

Concentrating.

Methodical.

DEKE (O.C.)
Helluva launch.
Neil looks up. Deke’s walked in. Neil shrugs, turns back to
the sink. Deke looks at him for a moment. Scrutinizing him.
DEKE
I talked with Chris and Bob about
the schedule and we’d like you to
command 11. Obviously, if 8 is
successful, 11 or 12 will probably
be our first attempt at a landing.
Neil nods, pleased, but doesn’t acknowledge the potentially
momentous nature of the mission.

111.
NEIL
Who are you thinking for the crew?
DEKE
Collins was cleared by the doc, he’s
the best Command Module Pilot
available. The Lunar Module Pilot,
well, you could take Lovell, but
it’s a quick turnaround. And he’s
in line for his own command.
NEIL
Who’s the other option?
DEKE
Buzz is the guy with the most
experience.
Neil considers.
NEIL
Let me have 24 hours.
INT. MCC, PILOT'S OFFICES - 9PM
Clock reads 9pm. Neil’s hunched over a preliminary training
schedule for Apollo 11.

Conrad, leaving, holds up a PACKET.

Labeled APOLLO 12.

Neil shrugs.

Conrad shakes his head.
CONRAD

Neil heads out. He starts to turn into the elevator bank when
he spots a LIGHT ON down the hall. Curious, he walks on...

THREE MEN in GAS MASKS are led into a theater packed with
reporters, pads and cameras ready. It’s ODD.
Apollo 11, Pre-Flight Press Conference
July 5, 1969
The men are led on stage to a TALL, THREE-SIDED PLASTIC BOX.
Fans are turned on to blow air TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE as the men
sit, take off the masks. It’s Neil, Mike Collins... and BUZZ.
Neil, STIFF, glances at Deke then walks to the podium.
NEIL
We're here today to talk a bit about
the forthcoming flight. We’re able
to talk about it because of previous
flights. Every flight took on new
objectives and left us with very few
additions to be completed. We’re
grateful to those people who made it
possible for us to sit here today.
Neil sits, no trace of emotion.

Deke takes the podium.

DEKE
We’ll take questions now.

Jim?

REPORTER #1
(standing)
Neil, when you learned you were
going to command this flight, were
you surprised? Overjoyed?
NEIL
...I was pleased.
REPORTER #1
Okay, but how would you compare this
feeling with winning an automobile?
Or being selected as an astronaut?
NEIL
(pause)
I was pleased.
The reporter isn’t pleased, but another jumps up.
NEWSWEEK REPORTER
Neil, were you aware that Ralph
Abernathy is planning a protest for
the day of the launch?

113.
NEIL
I was not.

No.

NEWSWEEK REPORTER
He said, and I quote, “A fifth of
this nation lives in poverty. In
the face of such suffering, space
flight represents an inhuman
priority.” Do you have any comment?
NEIL
No.
An awkward beat.

Deke shoots Neil a look.

Try harder.

REPORTER #2
Neil, if it does turn out, you’ll go
down in history. What kind of
thoughts do you have about that?
NEIL
(making an effort)
Several people have mentioned that.
I hope that you and the public will
recognize the thing as a group
effort because it really is that.
REPORTER #2
But when a thought hits you; ‘Gosh,
suppose that flight is successful’ -NEIL
I’m planning on it being successful.
Why do you always say ‘suppose that
flight will be successful?’
REPORTER #2
...uh, I just meant, how you look at
yourself as being part of history?
Neil hesitates... and in that moment Buzz jumps in.
BUZZ
I think I can shed some light here.
It’s a responsibility, but it’s
exciting to be first. Even my wife
is excited. She keeps slipping
jewelry into my PPK.
Some laughter.

Neil looks ever so slightly IRRITATED.

REPORTER #3
You’re planning to take some of her
jewelry to the moon, Buzz?

114.
BUZZ
Well, sure. What fella wouldn’t want
to give his wife bragging rights?
Buzz smiles, enjoying the limelight.
REPORTER #3
Neil, will you take anything?
NEIL
If I had a choice, I’d take more
fuel.
An awkward SILENCE. Then Mike LAUGHS. Reporters, relieved,
follow suit. But Neil doesn’t. Off Neil, UNCOMFORTABLE -INT.

NEIL AND JANET’S BEDROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a SUITCASE. Very tidy. FIND Neil packing.
Methodical. Emotionless. A beat, then Janet walks in.
JANET
Come say good night to the boys.
Neil keeps packing. A beat, then Janet reaches over, CLOSES
the suitcase. Neil looks up at her.
JANET
The boys want you to tuck them in.
NEIL
I gotta pack.
He starts to turn back but she GRABS his arm.

FORCEFUL.

JANET
I’d like you to talk to the boys.
NEIL
(firm)
I don’t have time.
JANET
Pat tried to commit suicide. Three
days ago. Did you even know? She’s
okay now. Okay as she’ll ever be.
(then, off Neil)
Everyday I pack your lunch, I make
your dinner and I... I used to hope
that someday I’d have something to
show for it. I won’t. I know that
now. And that’s fine. But Rick and
Mark? What are the chances you’re
coming back? 50 percent? 40?
(MORE)

115.
JANET (CONT'D)
What are the chances it’s the last
time they see you?
(and then)
You don’t have time? Make the
fucking time.
Off Neil, CUT TO -INT. MARK AND RICK'S BEDROOM, ARMSTRONG HOUSE - NIGHT
Rick (12) and Mark (6) both tucked in.

Neil on Rick’s bed.

RICK
So the trip is eight days?
Yes.

NEIL
RICK
(explaining to Mark)
They’ll be quarantined when they get
back, to make sure they haven’t
picked up any moon germs.
MARK
(worried)
Are you scared, Daddy?
NEIL
We’ve done everything before except
for the actual landing.
MARK
(beat)
But why do you have to go?
Neil hesitates.
NEIL
Because we have to demonstrate we
can do this.
Mark doesn’t know what to make of that.

Rick tries to help.

RICK
Dad’s going to be famous.
MARK
You are?
Neil doesn’t like the question any more than he did from the
reporters. He’s quiet. An AWKWARD BEAT. Jan steps in.

116.
JANET
Okay, it’s time for bed.
Relieved, Neil leaves.

HOLD ON Janet.

ALONE.

EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE (HOUSTON) - NIGHT
WIDE on the house. A BLACK CAR idling by the curb. Neil
comes to the door, duffel and a briefcase. He gives Janet a
perfunctory peck and walks to the car.
ON JANET, watching as Neil hands off his duffel, gets in the
car and, without so much as a look back, shuts the door.
INT. BLACK CAR (PARKED), ARMSTRONG HOUSE - SAME TIME
Neil sits back in his seat. He pulls out a mission briefing,
starts to read as the driver gets back in the car.
The car pulls off. In that moment, the tension LEAVES Neil’s
face. He looks out the window, at the houses slipping away...
and we see imperceptible RELIEF. The mission has begun.
EXT. ASTRONAUT CREW QUARTERS, CAPE CANAVERAL - 4 AM
A large campus, a maze of one story barracks.
Cape Canaveral, 4:20 AM, July 16, 1969
It's DARK, save for a light from one low window. And QUIET,
save for a MUFFLED THUMPING. THA-THUMP. THA-THUMP. The
sound takes us through the lit window into -INT. FLIGHT SURGEON'S OFFICE, CREW QUARTERS - SAME TIME
CLOSE ON a STETHOSCOPE. FIND Neil, shirtless, in front of the
flight surgeon. We hear Neil’s heart rate SPEED UP. Neil’s
eyes TICK to the Doc. Is he concerned? A long beat, then...
SURGEON
He’s clear. Send in Aldrin.
INT. MESS HALL, KSC, JULY 16, 1969 - LATER
Neil sits beside an odd flower centerpiece, working his way
through steak and eggs. Like it’s any other day.
DEKE (O.C.)
What the hell are you doing?
Deke eats breakfast with Neil and the two other astronauts.
He’s staring at Buzz, SIGNING multiple PHOTOS OF HIMSELF.

117.
BUZZ
Life insurance. Mine was denied.
(passing them to Deke)
Would you get these to Jean Ann?
Mike reacts. Seriously? Unnerved, he glances at Neil, but
Neil just keeps eating, totally unfazed.
GILRUTH (O.C.)
Gentlemen.
The men look up. Gilruth stands in the doorway, waiting.
It’s time. As Neil stands, we CUT TO -INT. CREW QUARTERS, CAPE CANAVERAL - 5:30 AM
Deke leads the men into the ready room.
around THREE ASTRONAUT SPACESUITS.

Multiple techs swarm

5:30 AM (T minus 4 hours, 3 minutes)
As the men start to strip down, we see A SERIES of QUICK CUTS:
Tape SEALS up a DIAPER around a man’s waist.
A MESH of LIQUID-COOLING TUBES are FILLED with water; a ZIPPER
CLOSES the thin, nylon one-piece containing them.
A ZIPPER CLOSES the internal pressure suit; a ‘SLIDE FASTENER’
ZIPS it shut; then a THERMAL SKIN is VELCROED on top of that.
METALLIC RINGS SNAP ON one glove, then another; SLEEVES are
ROLLED over the rings.
A COMMS (SNOOPY) CAP chin-strap is SNAPPED in place; its wire
is PLUGGED INTO the top of the suit.
An AIR NOZZLE is TWISTED ONTO the BLUE PORTAL on the front of
a spacesuit; we hear the HISS of air as...
A HELMET is PLACED on the head of a PRETERNATURALLY CALM NEIL.
The helmet SWIVELS into place and the sound FADES...
...we hear only the HISS OF OXYGEN as Neil CLOSES HIS EYES.
MATCH CUT TO -EXT. GANTRY ELEVATOR, LAUNCH PAD 39A, CAPE CANAVERAL - LATER
CLOSE ON Neil, eyes still closed.

The HISS of air pervades.

6:45 AM (T minus 2 hours, 48 minutes)

118.
Neil opens his eyes, takes in the ENORMOUS SATURN V ROCKET
beside him. He rises quickly up its side on the high speed
elevator with Buzz and Mike (suited up) and Deke.
And we can’t help but notice the FLOCK OF PRESS VANS below,
the HORDE OF MEDIA AND SPECTATORS stretching out before them.
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Guess we have a couple fans.
Even Mike and Buzz find it STAGGERING. But for Neil it’s
DEEPLY UNSETTLING. He looks away, eyes TICKING to the
checklist on his wrist, FOCUSING on it as only he can...
...until the elevator JERKS to a halt.
Ready?

DEKE (COMMS)
Neil looks up. The door SWINGS opens. They've reached SWING
ARM 9, which leads to the white room and the command module.
Neil grabs his oxygen tank and leads the others onto -EXT. SWING ARM 9, LAUNCH PAD 39A, CAPE CANAVERAL - CONTINUOUS
Neil walks forward, eyes on the CAPSULE. Techs scurry, we
hear chatter over comms, but it’s FAINT, SUBSUMED by the eerie
hiss of oxygen and Neil’s INTENSE FOCUS on the task ahead.
This is a solitary moment. Neil barely noticing as a tech
walks up to help him with his oxygen tank. Neil hands his
tank to the tech, blinks... the tech looks like ELLIOT.
Neil turns away... and spots a tech who looks like ED.
Neil pauses. PUSH IN on his face, his eyes... as he CLOSES
them. The HISSING grows louder and we PRELAP FAINT COMMS -LAUNCH DIRECTOR (PRELAP)
The leaky hydrogen valve on the 200
foot level shouldn’t be a problem...
MATCH CUT TO -INT. APOLLO 11 CSM, LAUNCH PAD 39A - LATER
Neil.

Eyes closed.
T minus 2 hours 10 minutes
LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
We’re powering up the console now.

119.
His eyes BLINK OPEN as the lights on the console FLASH ON.
Neil’s strapped into the capsule. Buzz and Mike beside him.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Console on. We’re go to close up.
The techs move to close the hatch but Deke leans in.
DEKE
Give me a second.
(to Neil, COMMS)
...We thought about a pill but we
realized if the landing goes south
and you get stranded you can just...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Purge the suits, go to sleep.
Neil’s thought it through, he isn’t fazed at all. Deke
reacts. SURPRISINGLY EMOTIONAL, he GRABS Neil’s gloved hand.
DEKE (COMMS)
Make us proud.
Deke exits. The techs move in to close the hatch, COVERING
the front window with a PROTECTIVE SHIELD. We HOLD ON the
three men in the tight, CLAUSTROPHOBIC cabin.
An odd quiet.

Eerily punctuated by a loud HISS.

LAUNCH CONTROL (COMMS)
Pressurizing the cabin.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Proceeding to checks. Running
Emergency Detection system.

Neil, seemingly oblivious to the stifling atmosphere, starts
into checks with the others and we see A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:
HANDS flipping through the Flight Plan and the Mission Rules.
FINGERS flicking switches, punching buttons.
EYES ticking from the books to the console to the clock.
MIKE (O.C., INTO COMMS)
Arming escape rocket...
MIKE (O.C., INTO COMMS)
Arming hand controllers.

NEIL (O.C., INTO COMMS)
Checking Propulsion System...
BUZZ (O.C., INTO COMMS)
Finalizing Stabilization...

NEIL (O.C., INTO COMMS)
Full internal power.

120.
A FINAL FLURRY of BUTTONS DEPRESSED, LIGHTING UP, of SWITCHES
FLIPPED ON and we arrive at...
FIDO (COMMS)
T minus 2 minutes.

LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
Final Pre-launch sequence.

The men sit, nothing to do but wait. Neil is BLANK, but we
FEEL the nervous anticipation of Buzz and Mike because...
we’re not going anywhere. WE’RE GONNA STAY WITH THE CREW FOR
THE WHOLE DAMN MISSION. So buckle the fuck up...
CRAFT TEST CONDUCTOR (COMMS)
Personnel status check
complete, all go.
TEST SUPURVISOR (COMMS)
Test supervisor, go for
launch.

LAUNCH OPS MANAGER (COMMS)
Operations is go for launch.
LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
We are on the automatic
sequence. Final abort checks.

PUSH IN on Neil, hand on the ABORT HANDLE.
FIDO (COMMS)
60 seconds and counting.

Seemingly CALM.

LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
All is still go. Propellant
tanks pressurized, oxidizer
tanks now have pressurized.

PUSH IN FURTHER on Neil’s EYES. Dark. INTENSE. A WEALTH of
EMOTIONS. We HOLD ON NEIL’S EYES as the call continues...
FIDO (COMMS)
T minus 30 seconds.

FIDO (COMMS)
20 seconds...

LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
3rd stage tanks pressurized,
readings indicate we are go.
LAUNCH DIRECTOR (COMMS)
2nd stage tanks pressurized,
guidance is now internal...

FIDO (COMMS)
T minus 10, 9, ignition sequence...
We hear a LOUD RUMBLING from far below as the capsule begins
to shake. HOLD ON Neil. Steady. Unyielding.
FIDO (COMMS)
6, 5, 4...
The noise gets LOUDER... the ROAR of 7.5 MILLION POUNDS OF
THRUST SLAMMING into the ground DROWNS OUT the countdown.

121.
The capsule BUCKS violently, SLAMMING Neil back in his seat.
It's FAR WORSE THAN GEMINI. Even Neil is STARTLED, but he
WILLS himself to FOCUS, eyes TICKING RAPIDLY from clock to
console as the ROAR goes on, the cockpit continues to SHAKE...
Neil glances to his right... Buzz looks TENSE, Mike looks
BEWILDERED... no sense of whether they've lifted off...
Can this possibly be what it's supposed to feel like?
Neil’s eyes TICK to his CHECKLIST... ROLL AT 15 SECONDS. He
glances at the clock, PUNCHES in the maneuver... and we FEEL
the rocket ROLL, g-forces so INTENSE all three men turn GREEN.
Neil PUSHES THROUGH, eyes GLUED to the instruments as, at
last, the roar FADES and, faintly, we hear COMMS...
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Mode 1 Charlie. Go for staging.
Neil nods to Buzz.

He hits a switch and the roar QUIETS.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Inboard cut off.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
(inputs sequence)
Staging... and ignit--

BOOM! The men are SLAMMED back into their seats... but the
shaking quickly FADES to an UNSETTLING QUIET as the second
stage propels them out of the atmosphere.
It’s SURPRISINGLY SERENE until...
BANG! Neil hits a button and the escape rocket and protective
shield are JETTISONED. BLUE SKY appears in the window.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Skirt SEP, tower’s gone.
Roger.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
We confirm.

MIKE COLLINS (INTO COMMS)
They finally gave us a window.
The small square of blue is a RELIEF... but Mike’s smile FADES
as the blue sky RAPIDLY TURNS BLACK... MUCH FASTER than Gemini
or in the X-15. It’s TERRIFYING, but Neil ignores it...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Prep for TLI. Pyros armed?

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
4 breakers in, switches up.

Buzz punches a ready button... and gets no response.
the button a few more times... it finally flicks ON.

He hits

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)

State of the art.

CAPCOM (COMMS)

Injection.

No, there’s no time for commentary.

Mike eyes a STOPWATCH...

MIKE COLLINS (INTO COMMS)
5, 4, 3, 2, 1... ignition.
Neil HITS the throttle. A FLASH out the window and they’re
PRESSED BACK in their seats again. It’s smooth, if JARRING...
CAPCOM (COMMS)
We confirm ignition, thrust is go.
Neil and Buzz monitor the burn, but Mike is DISTRACTED.

He

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Flashes out window five, could be
something with the engine.
The engine?

Shit.

Mike PALES as a console light FLASHES.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Pushing past earth gravity, we’re 10
feet-per-second off!
The capsule SHAKES. Neil just works a CALCULATOR, CALM. Mike
stares: Is it that he’s not worried? Or that he doesn’t care?
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Yaw, Mike.
Neil holds his calculations out to Mike.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
5... 5 seconds to nominal.

MIKE COLLINS (INTO COMMS)
(off Neil’s numbers)
...do that?

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Yes, we better do that.
Mike reacts to the SLIGHT URGENCY in Neil’s voice. He quickly
makes the adjustment. Neil hits the stick and POP! They’re
HURLED against their harnesses into MICROGRAVITY.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
We have cut-off.
The men catch their breath, pull off their helmets. As Neil
takes a reading, Buzz’s helmet FLOATS across the cabin. He
reaches for it, spots the VISTA in the window...

123.
NOTHING BUT SPACE. Earth is far behind already, they're on a
dark and lonely sea. It’s AWESOME. And TERRIFYING.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Residuals at 3.3 on the delta.
BUZZ
Good burn, good focus, Neil.
No answer from Houston.

MIKE COLLINS (INTO COMMS)
Houston, do you copy?

Mike leans in again.

MIKE COLLINS
Houston, you read? Do you read 11?
Still no answer. Buzz and Mike trade a look, the silence
CHILLING. Neil, unconcerned, jots down residuals, then -NEIL
Let’s prep for separation.
BUZZ
We should wait until we re-establish
contact. Mission Rules say we wait.
But Neil ignores him, starts PUNCHING BUTTONS.
surprised, takes the comms from Mike.

Buzz,

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Houston? Houston, you read us?
Still nothing.

Neil keeps prepping.

NEIL
Want to help me out, Mike?
Mike is UNEASY, unsure what to do.

An AWKWARD BEAT, then...

CAPCOM (COMMS)
11, Houston. Do you read?
Buzz and Mike trade a look.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Roger, Houston. We read an
EMS plus 3.3. Over.

11?

RELIEVED.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Roger. It looks like you are
well on your way now.

But Buzz and Mike pause, TROUBLED. Watching Neil. There's no
escaping what transpired. And there's no turning back.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Apollo 11, you’re go for separation.

124.
Mike and Buzz snap to, ready for the maneuver.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Pyro B coming armed.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Vehicle SEP pushbutton.

MIKE COLLINS (INTO COMMS)
Here we go. Thrusting... and SEP.
Neil hits the PYROS. The LOUD CRACK of the pyro explosion
surprises the crew and SMASH TO -EXT. TRANSLUNAR SPACE - SAME TIME
FROM AFAR we see the explosion RIP OFF four panels connecting
the Command Service Module (CSM) to the Saturn’s third stage.
It’s JARRING. Was that planned? We watch the panels FLOAT
off as the CSM and what’s left of the Saturn race on towards
the moon. The quiet is eerie, UNNERVING, until...
NEIL (COMMS)
Okay. I see a SLA panel going out.
Go for turn and dock.
RCS jets FIRE in four directions. In a THRILLING LONG SHOT,
the CSM slowly ROTATES 180 degrees, nosing towards what's left
of the Saturn rocket... and the LUNAR MODULE (LM) within.
NEIL (COMMS)
We need a 5 degree right, Mike...
It’s a STUNNING BALLET, the CSM shifting, INCHING forward...
NEIL (COMMS)
Capture probe, extend/release.
A small PROBE extends from the CSM’s nose, SCRAPING the LM...
NAILS on a chalkboard. Is something wrong? For a beat, we
wonder... then the LM’s DROGUE latches on. Both crafts SHAKE.
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Okay, I’m go for retract.

NEIL (COMMS)
Docking probe, retract.

The CSM gently PULLS the LM free of the Saturn, its FAMOUS
ORANGE HULL SHIMMERING in the sunlight. It's BREATHTAKING.
NEIL (COMMS)
Beginning solar rotation.
Slowly, the COMBINED CRAFT starts ROTATING, speeding BACKWARDS
towards the moon. We PAN around the ship... PUSH down the
side, CUTTING INTO --

125.
INT. APOLLO CSM, TRANSLUNAR SPACE - SAME TIME
Mike looks to the earth, FURTHER AWAY than he’s ever seen it
and SWIFTLY RECEDING into the distance... the magnitude of
what they're doing now clear.
It's HUMBLING.

FRIGHTENING.

MIKE COLLINS
Wish I’d thought to bring music.
Neil reaches into the hold, pulls out an 8-TRACK and floats it
to Mike. Mike surprised, grabs the 8-track, hits play as Neil
grabs a SEXTANT, starts checking their alignment...
We hear the 2nd movement of DVORAK'S NEW WORLD SYMPHONY.
purposeful, optimistic opening giving way to drums and a
LONELY CLARINET. It SWIRLS around the men...

The

...and now Buzz stops working, catching sight of the RECEDING
EARTH in the window. He and Mike STARE, struck by how FRAGILE
the earth looks, how SMALL.
Mike glances at Neil, taking readings, checking calculations,
not taking even a moment to note the majesty or the grandeur.
As the HAUNTING CLARINET moves us through time and space, the
earth getting smaller in the window, Neil fails to notice.
As he mechanically lifts ELLIOT’S SEXTANT for another reading-TIME CUT TO -MISSION DAY THREE (00:29:36). CLOSE ON a small compartment
door closing and a hand writing on it. SMELLY WASTE.
REVEAL Mike, GRIMY flight suit, thick STUBBLE, red eyes. He
floats past wires taped with soiled duct tape over to a grubby
CALENDAR scrawled on the wall. He crosses off day 3 of 9.
Mike wipes his brow, already sick of the DANK cabin and floats
over to Buzz and Neil (flight suits, stubble). They hover
over a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the moon.
DEKE (COMMS)
...the landing area is beyond the
Maskelyne series, it should be flat.
Which is good cause you won’t have
much wiggle room. That fuel tank’s
a bitch, if you’re not under 100
feet at 20 seconds to bingo -NEIL
We will be.

126.
He’s dismissive.

Buzz notes it.

Uneasy.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
Hate to interrupt, but we’ve played
back the LOI 2 burn, it looks good,
we got an orbit at 65.4 by 53.9.
As he says it, a DARK OBJECT fills THREE QUARTERS of the hatch
window. It’s our first close view of THE MOON, its barren
surface STARK and FORBODING. As the men take it in, CUT TO -EXT. THE CAPSULE, LUNAR ORBITAL INSERTION - CONTINUOUS
The craft floats BACKWARDS in orbit around the moon.
BUZZ (O.C.)
Man, look at it.
The moon is no longer an image in the window but a FULL-SCALE
PLANETARY BODY. The sight of the craft orbiting it is both
viscerally REAL and unbelievably UNREAL. It's STARTLING.
MIKE COLLINS (O.C.)
Boy, look at that son of a bitch.
Mike's voice PULLS US BACK INTO -INT. THE CAPSULE - CONTINUOUS
Mike and Buzz stare out at the moon, in AWE... but Neil’s
already focused on what’s next.
NEIL
Buzz.
(points, all business)
We just passed Mount Marilyn. We're
coming up on Maskelyne series,
coming into the landing area. We
roll right here at this... that
crater, the big one. Duke Island.
MIKE COLLINS
...that’s US 1, I guess.
NEIL
The flat area, that’s our target.
BUZZ
Sure is eerie looking.
MIKE COLLINS
There must be nothing more desolate
than inside some of these craters.

127.
They stare.

Buzz and Mike clearly both ANTSY.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Apollo 11, this is Houston, do you
read? The spacecraft is looking
good to us on telemetry. Flight is
requesting a burn status report.

Mike and Buzz move to comply, but Neil stares out the window.
PUSH IN on his eyes, resolved. More INTENSE then ever.
INT. APOLLO 11, BOTTOM DECK - DAY 3 (14:30:37)
The cabin lights are dim. Mike TAPES UP the windows to keep
out the sunlight and the bright moonshine.
MIKE COLLINS
I thought today went pretty well.
If tomorrow and the next day are
like today, we’ll be safe.
BUZZ (O.C.)
Absolutely.
The camera FLOATS DOWN to the lower deck, Buzz and Neil
stretched out in floating hammocks. Buzz is chatty, TENSE.
BUZZ
Helluva sight out there. You know
what you’ll say if we manage to
land? It’s an historic moment.
NEIL
We should sleep.
It’s ABRUPT. As Buzz, AFFRONTED, closes his eyes, we PAN UP
to Neil and PUSH IN on his EYES. WIDE OPEN. Tired, but
TICKING up and down, reading something. TILT UP to...
A MAP OF THE LUNAR LANDING AREA taped to the ceiling.
ON it for a beat...
...then PAN BACK DOWN to Neil.

We HOLD

Still studying the map.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
Apollo 11, Apollo 11. Good morning
from the Black Team.
We've TIME CUT... the day is upon us. Neil’s eyes now SUNKEN,
but we see the ADRENALINE PUMPING. As he sits up, we CUT TO --

128.
INT. APOLLO 11 CSM (COLUMBIA) - DAY 4 (00:03:00)
Mike, ON EDGE, works a fuel cell purge, a camera set up and an
auto maneuver. Neil collects his pack, preps to enter the LM.
MIKE COLLINS
All this food and stuff up here, you
going to take it with you? Chewing
gum, you want any of that?
Neil shakes him off.

Mike, sweaty, wrestles a storage bin.

MIKE COLLINS
This is a damn three-ring circus. I
got a fuel cell purge in progress, I
gotta watch an AUTO maneuver and -The storage bin POPS open, film rolls FLOAT in all directions.
MIKE COLLINS
(trying to grab them)
Christ! You son of a bitch, you!
Mike.

NEIL
Mike tries to SETTLE, clearly nervous about being left alone.
MIKE COLLINS
Come back, will you?
Neil nods, grabs his PLSS pack and FLOATS TO the open hatch at
the TOP of the CSM. STAY WITH NEIL as he FLOATS INTO -THE CONNECTING TUNNEL. We look up... from Neil’s POV, Buzz is
STANDING UPSIDE DOWN in the Lunar Module. It's DISORIENTING.
Neil BLINKS away the vertigo, pulls himself into -INT. LUNAR MODULE (EAGLE) - CONTINUOUS
We follow Neil in, ROTATING with him until what was just
upside down is RIGHT SIDE UP. Neil glances at Mike, now
upside down in the CSM, then closes the hatch.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Columbia, Eagle. Have you got the -got to the tunnel vent step yet?
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
I’m just coming to that.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Well, we’re waiting on you.

Buzz, ANTSY, looks at Neil, calmly stowing his gear.

129.
BUZZ
I heard Conrad was taking bets
before we left. He told me our odds
were about 10 to 1. The guy
actually had the audacity to ask me
which way I wanted to bet.
Neil doesn’t say anything.

It makes Buzz MORE FIDGETY.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
I’m going to start to depressurize.
We got just about a minute to go,
you guys all set?
Buzz looks to Neil.

Neil nods.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Maneuver us to undocking
attitude.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Roger.

We hear the CSM THRUSTERS repositioning the combined craft...
the moon TURNING SLOWLY in the window.
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Maneuver on target. 15 seconds.
Neil reaches for the throttle.

PUSH IN on his tired eyes...

JUMP CUT to his WATCH... seconds ticking by... until at last
we HEAR the probe above them RETRACT.
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
There you go.
Neil PUSHES the thruster.

The LM slowly moves from the CSM.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
Eagle, we see you on the steerable.
Neil looks towards the waiting moon.

PUSH OUT INTO --

EXT. LUNAR MODULE, LUNAR ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
FROM AFAR we see the LM slowly BREAKING AWAY from the CSM...
Roger.

NEIL (COMMS)
The Eagle has wings.

The gas jets ROTATE the LM, pointing the landing gear forward.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Go for powered descent.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Go for PDI, Eagle.

130.

Roger.

BUZZ (COMMS)
We read you.

But Buzz sounds CONCERNED as we PUSH BACK INTO -INT. LUNAR MODULE - SAME TIME
Neil STRUGGLES with a BREAKER on the console.
LOOSE, Neil tries to JAM it back into place.
NEIL
...cottonpicker won’t stay.

It’s come

CAPCOM (COMMS)
Eagle, Houston. Alignment is
go. One minute to ignition.

BUZZ
We should report the breaker.
Neil doesn’t respond, just keeps working on it.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
40 seconds.
BANG!

BUZZ
Protocol says we should --

Neil POUNDS the breaker back in.

It stays.

NEIL
Let’s prep for descent.
Neil gets to work, like nothing happened. For a moment, Buzz
stands, staring... UNEASY, knowing his life’s in Neil’s hands.
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
20 seconds.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
(focusing)
Altitude lights on. Proceed.

Neil eyes his stopwatch again... the seconds TICK by...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
3, 2, 1, 0... ignition.
Neil eases the throttle forward and the lunar module LURCHES
ahead... towards the surface.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Rate of descent looks good.
Neil's eyes TICK across the console; we’ve seen it before, but
now he’s PUSHING THROUGH fatigue, running on ADRENALINE...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
We went by the 3 minute point
early... a little off.

131.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Rate of descent looks good, altitude
rate looks right down the groove.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Our position checks downrange show
us to be a little off...
A button on the console FLASHES ON.
BUZZ
Program alarm.

1202.

It beeps softly.

1202...

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Houston, give us a reading on
the 1202 program alarm.

Roger.

CAPCOM (COMMS)

A long beat. The beeping seems to grow LOUDER. Neil's eyes
TICK RAPIDLY from the alarm to his DROPPING ALTITUDE GAUGE...
CAPCOM (COMMS)
We got...
STATIC.

Fuck.

The alarm seems to grow LOUDER, DEAFENING.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Houston, come in. Houston...
Buzz, relieved, shuts it off.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
...we’re go on that alarm.
Neil checks his instruments.

NEIL
5000 feet, attitude control’s good.
Another button FLASHES ON.

The same BEEPING again...

BUZZ
Same alarm.
Neil reacts, uncharacteristically ANNOYED.
CAPCOM (COMMS, STATIC)
Eagle, you’re... go, repeat,
you’re go for landing.
A THIRD ALARM beeps.

A new one.

Roger.

Buzz shuts it off.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Go for landing.

This time Neil IGNORES it.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Program alarm, 1201. It’s in core.
But Neil keeps flying.

The beeping PERVADES the tiny space.

132.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Houston, program alarm 1201.
(to Neil)
We should slow our descent.
Neil ignores him.

Buzz sees the moon RISING UP to meet them.

BUZZ
Neil, we need to slow our --

CAPCOM (COMMS)
1201 alarm, go for landing.
Same type.

As Buzz shuts off the alarm, Neil looks out the window, eyes
TICKING over the surface below... and then NARROWING.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Just past Maskelyne now... pretty
rocky area.
NEIL’S POV. The landing area is not flat. There’s a HUGE
CRATER, A HUNDRED YARDS ACROSS. Surrounded by GIANT BOULDERS.
THERE’S NO CLEAR AREA FOR LANDING.
Jesus.

BUZZ
We can’t land there.

Neil makes a QUICK DECISION, PUSHES on the throttle.
NEIL
Switching to manual control.
We hear the POP and HISS of the Descent Propulsion System
(DPS) as the craft RUSHES FORWARD. Buzz eyes the gauges...
Copy.

BUZZ
We have enough fuel?

Neil doesn’t respond.

Buzz does some quick calculations.

BUZZ
Not sure we have enough fuel to
clear the area. Neil?
NEIL
What’s the LPD?
Buzz glances at Neil, who remains focused on the surface.
BUZZ
Did you hear -Buzz hesitates.

NEIL
What’s the LPD?
Then gives Neil what he needs.

133.
BUZZ
47 degrees, 400 feet, down to 9.
Neil eases the thruster forward. The DPS HISSES as they push
over the rocky terrain. Buzz watches the PROPULSION CONSOLE.
CLOSE ON the FUEL NUMBER.

DROPPING.

12, 11, 10...

CAPCOM (COMMS, STATIC)
We see you’ve... manual... give an
update, Eagle?
Neil doesn't say a thing.

He remains focused, INTENT.

BUZZ
300 down, 47 forward...

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
What’s going on there? You
keeping an eye on your fuel?

Neil grips the throttle, eyes TICKING FURIOUSLY from the
window to the ALTITUDE GAUGE. As the DPS HISSES...
RACK FOCUS to Buzz, UNSETTLED, staring at the propulsion
console. CLOSE ON the fuel numbers. 8, 7, 6...
BUZZ
Fuel is getting low.
Neil IGNORES him. Buzz CLOCKS Neil’s intensity... and at that
moment he knows. Neil's landing this ship one way or another.
UNNERVED, nothing to do but help, Buzz continues the call.
BUZZ
250, down at 2, 19 forward.
Buzz sees the fuel numbers have DROPPED BELOW 5.
BUZZ
160 feet, 6 down, 9 forward.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
Your fuel’s below low level!

Neil keeps going, even as the FUEL QUANTITY LIGHT FLASHES ON.
BUZZ
120 feet, 3 down, 9 forward,
fuel is at five perc --

NEIL
I understand.

There’s FIRE in Neil’s eyes, DETERMINATION, an ABJECT REFUSAL
TO ABORT. Jesus. Buzz TENSES.
CAPCOM (COMMS, STATIC)
...45 seconds to Bingo.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS, STATIC)
You need to consider abort--

134.
Neil ignores him, eases the throttle forward.
CAPCOM (COMMS, STATIC)
30 seconds to Bingo. Neil?
Neil eyes TICK from the gauges to the window in front of
him... it’s unclear whether he’s even LISTENING anymore.
Neil...

BUZZ
MIKE COLLINS (COMMS, STATIC)
...you’re almost out of fuel.

Neil remains unresponsive. The hiss is DEAFENING. Buzz looks
from Neil to the FUEL GAUGE, eyes filled with ANXIETY.
NEIL
Position.
Buzz, disconcerted, just stares at the FLASHING FUEL GAUGE.
CAPCOM (COMMS, STATIC)
20 seconds to Bingo.
Buzz blinks, refocuses.

Position.

NEIL
Buzz!

He checks their position.

BUZZ
90 feet, down a half.
DUST SWIRLS up from the lunar surface. Buzz glances at the
fuel. CLOSE ON the numbers. 3, 2... FUCK. Buzz’s eyes WIDEN.
BUZZ
50 feet down... picking up
dust, drifting right...

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
10 seconds, Neil!

BUZZ
20 feet, down a half, drifting
forward just a little bit...
And then, before they realize what's happening, a GREEN LIGHT
FLASHES on the console. Buzz blinks in DISBELIEF.
BUZZ
Contact light.
Shutdown.

NEIL

Neil, SPENT, lets the throttle SLIP from his hands. He flips
the switch. The dust starts to settle and we see...
...the LUNAR SURFACE stretching out in front of them. Neil
stares, BLANK. Buzz is completely STUNNED. A beat, then Buzz
recovers, starts powering down the LM.

135.
BUZZ
Engine stop; ACA out of
DETENT.

CAPCOM (COMMS)
...copy you down, Eagle.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Houston, Tranquility Base here.
Eagle has landed.

The

An ENORMOUS CHEER goes up in Mission Control. Neil FLINCHES.
It’s VISCERAL; something about it hits him right in the gut.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Roger, tranquility.... copy... You
got a lotta guys about to turn blue.
We’re breathing again, thanks a lot.
Neil sits, struggling to process.

Buzz extends a shaky hand.

BUZZ
Very smooth touchdown.
Neil, AWKWARD, nods. PUSH IN on his eyes, deep PAIN and JOY
battling within and we hear a familiar HISS...
MATCH CUT TO -INT. LUNAR MODULE - LATER
CLOSE ON Neil’s eyes.

Staring ahead as he puts his helmet on.

He snaps the helmet into place then reaches for a glove. And
snaps it on. Meticulous, careful... cognizant of the DANGERS
of the lunar surface and the enormity of the moment.
Neil reaches for a second glove when Buzz, struggling with his
PLSS in the small cabin, JOSTLES him. The force pushes Neil
towards the thin wall of the LM...
...we hear a small SNAP... and just as it seems Neil might go
through the wall he GRABS the ceiling and stops himself.
BUZZ
Sorry...
Neil looks to see what snapped... can’t find anything. Not
entirely satisfied, he nonetheless returns to the task at
hand, putting on his on PLSS and connecting the oxygen tube.
We hear a familiar HISS as Neil takes a beat, eyeing a PAD
clipped to the wall, a SCRIBBLED SENTENCE. One small step...
We can’t make out all the words, but we know what it says.

136.

Ready?

BUZZ (COMMS)
Buzz is fully suited up. Neil nods and Buzz opens a valve.
Through the window, we see the AIR in the LM VENTING OUT.
It’s nerve-wracking, all that air disappearing into space.
A long beat... then it STOPS.
BUZZ (COMMS)
Lunar module depressurized.
Buzz reaches for the hatch... but it won’t budge.
BUZZ (COMMS)
Damn thing.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Too much pressure in here.

Buzz pulls again, harder.
Shit.

BUZZ (COMMS)
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Don’t rupture it.

Buzz stops. FRUSTRATED. Then something occurs to him... He
reaches up and PEELS BACK a small part of the flimsy door. We
hear a slight HISS. Then the door easily PULLS OPEN...
...revealing the gray, barren surface below.
Neil and Buzz STARE, taking in the world outside the door.
In this moment, we understand how odd, how UNDENIABLY STRANGE
it is to be parked on the surface of another heavenly body.
Neil lumbers forward, towards the hatch.
PUSH IN on him, a
bevy of emotions flickering across his face...
...a face we HOLD ON as he lowers his feet through the hatch,
climbing down the ladder to...
EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - 04 13 43 00
TIGHT ON Neil, sweat on his brow as he SHIMMIES down the
ladder, down towards the new world. He remains focused, eyes
on the LADDER, HANDS, FEET, until he reaches the final rung.
He stares out, a million things going through his mind...
The ODDNESS of it all... the DESOLATE BEAUTY... the years of
work and sacrifice... and Elliot... and Ed...
...and now he catches a glimpse of the EARTH off on the
horizon... hovering there... and the MAJESTY of it... the
GLORY of what he’s done... it almost OVERWHELMS him.

137.
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Okay, Neil, we can see you coming
down the ladder now.
Neil tries to keep it together, STRUGGLING THROUGH...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m, uh, at the foot of the ladder,
the LEM footbeds are only uh...
depressed in the surface about...
uh, one or two inches. I’m gonna
step off the LEM now.
And now he takes that little hop down ONTO THE MOON... oddly
DISCONNECTED from the moment, the rote line he’s memorized...
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
That’s one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind...
PUSH IN on Neil, STILL STRUGGLING. The COMMS FADE and he hops
forward... turning from the golden, glimmering lunar module...
...to the BEAUTIFUL BLUE PLANET hovering just above the
horizon. And now he finds he’s UNABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF...
A TEAR FALLS.

A bevy of emotions rising to the surface...

Pain. Joy. Loss. Triumph. All swirling round until the
tears come FREELY, raining down with all the pent up feelings.
It’s the first and last such outburst we’ll ever see.
BUZZ (PRELAP, COMMS)
Beautiful view.
MATCH CUT TO -EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER
Buzz lumbers across the lunar surface to Neil, who’s still
staring out at the earth. The LM shimmers in the background.
NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Isn’t that something. Magnificent.
BUZZ (COMMS)
Magnificent desolation.
The words RESONATE. As Neil takes it all in, we, like Neil,
are humbled before the MAJESTY of space.
The last ten years flicker before us, not in flashback, but in
the depths of Neil’s eyes. And for a moment, the WONDER there
makes us feel like maybe, just maybe, it was all worth it.

138.
Off the view from the mountaintop, the LOOK in Neil’s eyes...
MATCH CUT TO -EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - LATER
Neil’s eyes are FOCUSED, his face sweating.
Neil?

BUZZ (COMMS)
PULL BACK to find Neil walking, or rather LOPING, away from
the Eagle. Buzz, standing by the American Flag in the far
b/g, watches... Confused.
Neil keeps moving... until he comes to the edge of a CRATER.
He surveys it. Deep and vast, it’s like nothing we’ve seen.
BUZZ (COMMS)
Neil, we need to get back.
A beat. Then Neil UNZIPS a pocket in the front of his suit.
He reaches in, pulls out a few items and looks down at them.
An APOLLO 1 PATCH - GRISSOM WHITE CHAFFEE. ELLIOT’S SEXTANT.
And finally a SMALL BRACELET. That of a little girl.
PUSH IN on Neil’s eyes, on the PAIN.
the three tokens far as he can...

A beat, then Neil THROWS

Off Neil, watching them soar on and on and on...
INT. LUNAR MODULE - LATER
Neil and Buzz stand in the LM, the hatch closed, brushing each
other off. Moon dust swirls, slowly falling to the floor. At
last, they take off their helmets... and start COUGHING.
The COUGHING takes us to...
INT. LUNAR MODULE - LATER
Neil preps for liftoff in his flight suit, still COUGHING.
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
ATT Control, 2 minutes to... for the
guidance steering in the AGS.
On.

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Right?

Right.

BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
Master arm, Engine arm on?

139.
Neil pauses.
It’s BROKEN.

Buzz sees Neil examining the engine arm switch.
Just a small stub. Shit.

NEIL
Must’ve hit it when I got
out.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
One minute to launch.

If they can’t fix it, they can’t get off the moon.
Buzz STARES. Shit shit shit. Neil bends down, examines the
stub. Buzz eyes the clock. 50 seconds... 45 seconds...
NEIL
You got a pen?
Takes Buzz a moment, then he floats a PEN over to Neil. Neil
grabs it, jams it beside the stub. And pulls... Nothing.
Dammit.

NEIL
A tense beat.

MIKE COLLINS (COMMS)
30 seconds.

Neil tries again.

And again...

MIKE COLLINS
20 seconds.
Fuck.

Neil SHOVES the pen in deeper... and PULLS...

...until at last we hear a CLICK. The light FLASHES. ENGINE
ARMED. Buzz takes a breath, his face FLOODING with relief.
NEIL
Got your ascent card?
Recovering, Buzz preps for launch. Neil does too, but his
focus is FARAWAY, eyes LINGERING on the lunar horizon...
BUZZ (INTO COMMS)
15... 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, abort stage
- engine arm, ascent, proceed...
Neil HITS the thrusters. DUST kicks up as the ship ROCKS BACK
AND FORTH, lifting off the surface... casting a LONG SHADOW as
it slowly rises above the moon...
BUZZ
Look at that shadow.

Beautiful!

HOLD ON Neil's eyes, watching the moon fall away. As we do,
we hear familiar voices from a television broadcast...
WALTER CRONKITE (O.C.)
It may not be a beauty one can pass
on to future beholders.
(MORE)

140.
WALTER CRONKITE (O.C.)
These first men on the moon can see
something that men who follow will
miss...
PUSH IN on Neil.

Staring out at the moon.

ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
Yes, we're always going to feel,
somehow, strangers to these men.
Off Neil, we CUT TO -EXT. USS HORNET, NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN - JULY 24, 1969
A ship of men, watch, excited, as the Apollo Capsule
parachutes down from the skies...
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
They will, in effect be a bit
stranger... even to their own wives
and children...
EXT. APOLLO 11 CAPSULE, NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN - LATER
Neil, Buzz and Mike, covered in FULL BODY CONTAMINATION SUITS,
are helped out of the floating capsule and onto a small skiff.
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
...disappeared into another life
that we can't follow.
INT. USS HORNET, NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN - LATER THAT WEEK
The men, in contamination suits, are walked across a lower
deck to the QUARANTINE AIRSTREAM that awaits. The enter it.
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
I wonder what their life will be
like, now.
APOLLO 11 QUARANTINE AIRSTREAM MONTAGE
The QUARANTINE AIRSTREAM is moved onto an ARMY TRUCK...
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
The moon treated them well...
From ARMY TRUCK to AIR FORCE PLANE...
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
How people on earth will treat these
men, the rest of their lives...
From AIR FORCE PLANE to ANOTHER AIR FORCE TRUCK...

141.
ERIC SEVAREID (O.C.)
That gives me more foreboding, I
think, than anything else...
...and at last to the MSC QUARANTINE FACILITY.
INT. TOWN CAR (MOVING) - HOUSTON, TX - DAY
ON JANET. In back, staring out the window. As the car pulls
ahead, we hear a DULL ROAR. Janet’s eyes WIDEN. REVERSE TO -THE MSC ENTRANCE. A THRONG OF PEOPLE around a HUGE DISPLAY of
FLOWERS and SIGNS, the pride PALPABLE. Janet TEARS UP.
FLIGHT SURGEON (PRELAP)
We'll keep them in quarantine for
the full three weeks -INT. HALLWAY, QUARANTINE FACILITY, MSC - JULY 28, 1969 - DAY
A FLIGHT SURGEON leads Janet down a lackluster hall.
FLIGHT SURGEON (O.C.)
...but none of the tests have shown
any sign of infection or disease.
They reach a door, an ARMY GUARD. Janet’s escort hands him
papers and the guard opens the door. They walk into -INT. QUARANTINE PRESS ROOM, MCC - CONTINUOUS
The NASA logo. And a GLASS WALL. On the other side of it, in
a large room, Neil stands in a flight suit. Alone.
Janet, relieved, walks to the glass. Neil looks at her, but
his eyes are FARAWAY. Impossibly distant. Janet TIGHTENS.
HOLD ON the two of them, as far apart as they’ve ever been.
INT. ASTRONAUT LOUNGE, QUARANTINE FACILITY, MSC - LATER
CLOSE ON a SEA of MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS: TIME, LIFE, the
NEW YORK TIMES... All with front page coverage of Apollo 11.
FIND BUZZ hovering over it all, staring at a TV. MESMERIZED.
Neil walks in. Glances at the TV, reporters asking people
where they were when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.
BUZZ
Have you seen this? Can you believe
it? The entire world was watching.
We missed the whole damn thing.
Buzz shakes his head.

He looks LOST.

Off Neil, processing...

142.
EXT. QUARANTINE FACILITY, MSC - AUGUST 10, 1969, NIGHT (9PM)
Three BLACK CARS parked in front of the building. Doors open
and Mike, Buzz and Neil exit with duffels, MILITARY ESCORTS.
The men BREATHE IN the fresh air... then walk to the cars.
INT. TOWN CAR (MOVING), MSC GATE

- NIGHT

Neil sits in back, quiet, as the car pulls up to the MSC gate.
The escort beside him rolls down the window, hands papers to a
GUARD. He starts to wave them through... but can't resist.
GUARD
Mr. Armstrong, you make us proud.
Neil nods, AWKWARD. The escort rolls up the window and the
driver pulls forward. A beat, then...
ESCORT
He’s right, you’re a real hero. I
bet you’re the most famous man in
the world.
Neil gives the escort a tight smile, his eyes TICKING to a
NEWS VAN that starts to tail them. Off Neil, TENSE, CUT TO -EXT./INT. TOWN CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
The town car turns off the main road into a suburban
development. THREE NEWS VANS now follow behind.
INSIDE THE CAR Neil’s ANTSY. The car turns a corner and we
see... a HUGE MEDIA CIRCUS. TV trucks, reporters, fans camped
out at Neil’s house. Neil’s jaw goes TIGHT as the car stops.
ESCORT
I’ll clear a path.
The escort opens the door. Neil steps out and is SWARMED...
INUNDATED with questions, BLINDED by an ARSENAL of CAMERAS.
PUSH IN on Neil as he presses through it, eyes down... until a
LITTLE GIRL steps forward. With a model rocket. Neil PAUSES.
FATHER
Would you mind signing it for her?
Neil’s eyes TICK from the girl to her father. A beat, then he
takes the model. The reporters QUIET. One hands him a pen.
NEIL
Uh, what’s your name?

143.
GIRL
...it’s Katherine.
Neil blinks at her. The WONDER in her eyes is oddly DAUNTING.
Awkward, he signs the rocket. But when he hands it back...
MULTIPLE FANS
(calling out)
Can I get an autograph, Neil? / Can
I get a picture, Mr. Armstrong?
Neil BLANCHES.

The calls grow into a ROAR, TAKING US TO --

INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE, NEW YORK CITY - AUGUST 13, 1969, 10AM
A RIVER of HUMANITY. A huge crowd gathered for the largest
TICKER TAPE PARADE we’ve ever seen. The DIN is DEAFENING
New York City - August 13, 1969
Find Neil in an OPEN-TOP CONVERTIBLE with Buzz and Mike.
Neil’s eyes have DARK CIRCLES underneath; they DART from the
crowds on the streets, to the men and women hanging out of
building windows, tossing down stacks of IBM punch cards...
Buzz and Mike enjoy it more than Neil, but even they seem
OVERWHELMED. Off Neil, smile PLASTERED to his face, CUT TO -INT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL, BALLROOM - LA - AUGUST 13, 1969
A packed ballroom. Black tie. President Nixon, forty odd
Governors, Hollywood Stars and dozens of other dignitaries.
A gala to end all galas. Everyone GIDDY in anticipation.
From BEHIND the empty head table, we see GOVERNOR RONALD
REAGAN clink his glass into the mic at the rostrum.
GOVERNOR REAGAN (O.C.)
Ladies, Gentlemen, I understand our
guests of honor have just arrived.
If you’ll take your seats...
As the crowd sits, we PUSH INTO -INT. GREEN ROOM, CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - SAME TIME
Neil, Buzz, Mike and their wives stand, waiting to be
introduced. Neil is at the back, SWEATING now.
DEKE
Who wants a beer?
Deke walks in with beers for the men.

144.
GOVERNOR REAGAN (O.C.)
How about a California welcome for
Command Module Pilot Mike Collins!
MIKE COLLINS
Put mine on ice, will ya?
As Mike heads off, Deke pulls Neil off to one side.
DEKE
Everything okay?
NEIL
I got the itinerary.

25 countries?

DEKE
The whole damn world wants to give
you guys a hug.
NEIL
When can we get back to work?
DEKE
This is work.
NEIL
Deke. When are we going back up
again?
DEKE
Neil... you’re a symbol now. We
can’t risk losing you up there.
Neil stares.

Realizing that he's permanently grounded.
GOVERNOR REAGAN (O.C.)
And now, the man you’ve been waiting
for, the first man to walk on the
moon, Neil Armstrong!

As the crowd breaks out in applause and cheers, Neil,
DEVASTATED, walks into -INT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL, BALLROOM, LA - CONTINUOUS
As the cheers SWELL, PUSH IN on Neil, in front of the crowd,
only now realizing he's made the greatest sacrifice of all.
As he nods to the crowd, NUMB, the isolation now complete...
FADE OUT.
