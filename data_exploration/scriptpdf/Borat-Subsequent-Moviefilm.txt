You are sugar baby?

TUTAR

MACEY
Okay, high five.

MACEY (CONT’D)
I love that. That’s what you want.
As a woman, you never want to be a
person who is aggressive. You want
to be more submissive.
Oh.

TUTAR

MACEY
We have to be kind of weak.
TUTAR
But I am strong. I can open a beer
with my small hole.

27.
MACEY
Look, we gotta be appropriate and
ladylike...
Macey watches as Tutar ATTEMPTS TO OPEN A BEER WITH HER
ASSHOLE.
MACEY (CONT’D)
Okay. This is what you’re not
supposed to do.
The CAP OF THE BOTTLE POPS OFF.
MACEY (CONT’D)
Okay, you did do it. Okay, so we’re
not gonna do what you just did ever
on a date. Because if you do that,
they won’t like you. You want them
to like you. And so that way you
can get money from them.
TUTAR
What can I do to make a man like
me?
MACEY
You need a total makeover. Okay?

Yes, I love it.
As Michelle rings up the clothes:

Michelle?
MICHELLE
No, this is my store. My name’s
Michelle. And I own this store.
What?
Yes.

TUTAR
MICHELLE

Tutar, shocked, turns to her dad.
TUTAR
Tatti, a woman can own a business?
BORAT
No, when a woman owns a business
her brain breaks and her head falls
off. Just like the previous owners.
Look!
He motions to some HEADLESS CHILD MANNEQUINS.
BORAT (CONT’D)
So young... tragic.

32.

BORAT
No, it’s dangerous. Look at the

He picks up the DAUGHTER MANUAL to confirm.

This happened when a woman tried to
be a journalist.
He shows her the book. Her eyes widen. It’s a PHOTO of a

What about driving a car?
BORAT
Driving a car?! This is what
happened when a woman drove a car.
He turns to another page. It’s a PHOTO of the HINDENBURG

horrified.

Can a woman ask questions?
BORAT
Questions? Uh, I think it’s
dangerous.

BORAT
He probably forgot to bring a
leash.
DAUGHTER

BORAT
It is illegal to give you treat.

authorities to see.
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND CAKE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
They go behind a DUMPSTER. Tutar holds A BIG CAKE BOX in both
hands. Borat holds the CUPCAKE.
TUTAR
Ooo! I can’t wait to eat this!
BORAT
Hide back here.
Borat looks around to ensure no one is watching.
Ready?

BORAT (CONT’D)

Borat feeds the cupcake to her. She beams, it’s been the best
day ever! She has BUTTERCREAM all over her face.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Okay, slow down!
TUTAR
But it’s so good!
BORAT
I know but go slower, slower! Oh,
oh, oh-Suddenly, Tutar begins CHOKING.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Are you okay?
TUTAR
I swallowed the baby.
BORAT
Are you serious?

37.
TUTAR
I swallowed the baby.
BORAT
You’re not supposed to eat the
baby!

She want it out now please. Can you
take it out?
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
No we cannot. That’s not what we do
here.
Why not?

BORAT

ANTI-ABORTIONIST
What you say “take it out” - you

No it is living right now.

38.
BORAT

thumb to show size)
It this big.
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
It has a heartbeat. Right now.
BORAT
I don’t think so.
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
It is a living, breathing life that
God has created.
BORAT
I don’t think he is breathing.
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
We can show you that it’s
breathing.
TUTAR
It hurt my stomach.
Mm-hmm.

ANTI-ABORTIONIST

TUTAR
And it will hurt my asshole.
Mm-hmm.

ANTI-ABORTIONIST

arm like this.
(sticks his arms out)
It can tear it.
Right.

ANTI-ABORTIONIST

BORAT
I feel bad because I was the one
who put the baby in her.
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
You don’t need to feel bad.
BORAT
I was just trying to give my
daughter pleasure, and next thing I
know there is a baby inside her.

39.

You keep calling her your daughter.
Yes.

BORAT

ANTI-ABORTIONIST
Okay. Is he your father?
Yes.

TUTAR

BORAT

ANTI-ABORTIONIST

BORAT

The pastor puts his hand up to stop Borat.
BORAT (CONT’D)
But look at that face!
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
I understand.
BORAT
How could I not give it to her?
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
I understand.

40.
BORAT
Would you have not give it to her?
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
Listen. That is not important right
now. We’re at this moment. It
really doesn’t matter how we got to
this moment.
TUTAR
When he treat me, he say “this will
be our little secret.”
BORAT
Yes. This was why I do it behind
the dumpster so no one can see.
The anti-abortionist nods.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Now that you know I am her father,
can we take it out now please?
ANTI-ABORTIONIST
God is the one who creates life.
And God doesn’t make accidents.

Uh, she want to keep the baby...
You know what it’s like.
Tutar comes out of the stall.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Tutar. Your makeover is complete...

Really?

TUTAR

BORAT
Yes. But to be sure, let’s have a
practice run tonight.
She smiles.

BORAT
When I at the ball, is it sufficient
to make little braggings about little
missy.
SHEFFIELD
Maybe, yes. And you know what? You
have to do it very, let’s say,
graciously.
BACK AT THE BALL:

Borat talks to an ANOTHER DAD.
ANOTHER DAD
That’s your daughter?

Five hundred dollar.
BORAT

BORAT

TUTAR (CONT’D)
Why do American men hate me?

Borat closes the horsebox door and goes inside. But it’s
bothering him that she’s so sad... He comes back out,
unlocking the cage, gesturing for her to come in.
Come in.

BORAT

TUTAR
Really? Do you mean it, Tatti?
Borat nods.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
Thank you so much, Tatti.
She goes to hug him. He pulls away, “careful.” He downplays
it, not revealing that HE’S STARTING TO CARE ABOUT HER.
She lays on the floor of the horsebox. He puts a blanket over
her.
Before she closes her eyes to sleep, she pulls out the little
CUPCAKE DOLL from earlier and draws a mustache on it. REVEAL

Him?
Arrested.

TUTAR
BORAT

A PHOTO of PAUL MANAFORT.

TUTAR
What about Rudolph Giuliani?
She pulls up a PHOTO of RUDY GIULIANI looking insane.

INT. FAX STORE - A LITTLE LATER
Back at the fax store, the employee pulls a message out of
the fax machine.
BORAT

FAX EMPLOYEE
You’re not going to be killed.
BORAT
I love you.

INT/EXT. FOOTAGE - DAY

the middle to the side!
FOOTAGE of Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani posing together.
BORAT (V.O.)
Rudolph was McDonald’s best buddy
in whole world. And also very
dignified statesman of the highest
order.
FOOTAGE of Giuliani on Fox News.
GIULIANI (FOOTAGE)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about, idiot! Shut up, moron, shut
up!
BORAT (V.O.)
This would not be easy.
Am IMAGE of a news article: “Rudy Giuliani bragged about
affair with ‘big-boobed’ married woman.”
BORAT (V.O.)
Luckily, I discover his preference
for womens with ample cheeseproducing capacity. I take my
daughter to man who can help.

53.
EXT. OUTSIDE PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - DAY
SIGN: COSMETIC SURGERY CENTER
Borat, in UZBEK JOURNALIST disguise, and Tutar, in her YELLOW
DRESS, arrive.
The walk to the door and both try to enter at the same time.
After me.

BORAT

INT. PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
They meet an UNETHICAL PLASTIC SURGEON.
BORAT
I want very much her to be attract
to top level guy.
CHYRON: DR. CHARLES WALLACE, PLASTIC SURGEON
SURGEON
Well, what I would suggest is that
we do some simple things. Like a
little refinement of the nose-TUTAR
What’s wrong with my nose? Do I
look like a Jew?
SURGEON
No ma’am. Not at all.
Borat and Tutar are relieved.
SURGEON (CONT’D)
(demonstrating with nose)
Because a Jew would be like this...
BORAT
(also demonstrating)
Jew nose more like, out, out a bit
more, down, here, then down a bit,
here, bump, bump, in.
SURGEON
It can be that bad, yes. And then
if you like, what I would suggest,
is that maybe we put some breast
implants.

54.
BORAT
And what it mean, breast?
SURGEON
(grabbing chest)
The breast. Titty.
BORAT
(confused)
Titty?
Titty.

SURGEON

BORAT
(still confused)
Titty?
Titty.

SURGEON

BORAT
(not getting it)
Titty?
Titty.

SURGEON

Borat looks to Tutar.
TUTAR
(learning)
Titty.
Or breast.

SURGEON

TUTAR
I want a man who wants to make a
sex attack on me.
SURGEON
Mm-hmm.
(beat)
Well, I think that would be most
men.
TUTAR
Would you make a sex attack on me?
SURGEON
If your father was not here. Or if
we were together...

55.
Borat and Tutar high five.
INT. PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - MINUTES LATER
Borat and Tutar speak with an ACCOUNTS MANAGER.
Hello.
Hello.

ACCOUNTS MANAGER
BORAT

ACCOUNTS MANAGER
So all together, the total is
$21,751.
How much?
$21,751.

BORAT
ACCOUNTS MANAGER

BORAT
Tenge? Or dollar?
Dollars.

ACCOUNTS MANAGER

He FARTS when he hears the cost.
BORAT
Okay. With the saline implant-Yes.

ACCOUNTS MANAGER

BORAT
--Could you take off some money if
instead you use potatoes.
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
We cannot use potatoes.
Why not?

BORAT

ACCOUNTS MANAGER
Because potatoes aren’t sterile.
BORAT
This a very good potato...

56.
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
But you cannot take a potato and
put it in the body.
BORAT
What if we allow perverts in to
watch the surgery. Can we have
reduction? You can keep the money
that they pay you.
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
Uh, absolutely not. The more people
you bring in, the more germs come
in. You cannot do that. The
perverts have to be medical
personnel. They have to be either a
doctor or a nurse.
BORAT
I want to make sure that the man I
give her to is very happy and will
not return her.
ON TUTAR, she looks sad.
Okay.

ACCOUNTS MANAGER

BORAT
So the quality must be tip top.
Will it be?
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
It’ll be tip top. It’ll be more
than tip top. Are you able to pay
this amount?
BORAT
Yes, I have.
He puts a SUITCASE full of MONEY on the desk.
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
Okay, thank you.
As the ACCOUNTS MANAGER counts out money (most of which is $1
bills) Borat and Tutar take a seat.
BORAT
That’s a lot of money, but worth
it.

57.
TUTAR
So after you give me as a gift...
you will leave me?
BORAT
Of course. I will go home and you
will have new owner.
TUTAR
So I will never see you again?
BORAT
You expected me to come live with
you both?
TUTAR
No... of course not.
BORAT
(chuckling)
The manual would forbid it.
She’s DISAPPOINTED, her THEME comes in, in a minor key. She
has the realization that her Tatti is going to leave her.
Meanwhile, the ACCOUNTS MANAGER finishes counting.
BORAT (CONT’D)
You have, uh, sufficient?
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
No, I’m short seventy-two dollars.
BORAT
And if we do not get you this you
cannot make the surgery anyway?
ACCOUNTS MANAGER
Right.
(then)
And the surgery will start at six
p.m.
BORAT
I only have twenty-four hours to
get you seventy-two dollar?!
Well, yes.

ACCOUNTS MANAGER

BORAT
We better get to work.

58.
EXT. STREET / BABYSITTER’S HOUSE - NEXT DAY
Borat, in GREY HERO SUIT, and Tutar, in YELLOW TOP and JEAN
OVERALLS with TOO-HIGH HEELS, walk up to a modest home.
BORAT (V.O.)
To pay for new chests, I would need
employment. So next day, I leave my
daughter with babysitter.
EXT/INT. BABYSITTER’S HOUSE - DAY
Borat RINGS the doorbell. It’s answered by a REGULAR AFRICANAMERICAN BABYSITTER. SHE’S VERY CONFIDENT. She represents the
mother Tutar never had.
Hello.

BABYSITTER

BORAT
Uh, what your name?
Jeanise.

BABYSITTER

CHYRON: JEANISE JONES
BORAT
Jeanise, nice meet you.
BABYSITTER
Nice meeting you.
Borat uses a CLICKER to signal Tutar inside. She ALMOST TRIPS
on her heel. Borat feeds her a TREAT. She goes to crouch in
the corner on her heels.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
So what is that, like a treat?
BORAT
Treat, uh, yeah. When she perform a
command correctly. Click. You give
her treat.
BABYSITTER
Um, oh. Okay.
Borat hands over a BALL AND CHAIN.
BORAT
This is her ball. It make her feel
safe.

59.
Borat gives a list of ABSURD ways to discipline and look
after her [much like she was an animal].
BORAT (CONT’D)
For water... please use this.
He hands her a DOG BOWL.
BABYSITTER
We drink water out of a glass.
BORAT
The strings in her brain might
break if you try to teach her so be
careful please.
BABYSITTER
You said... the strings in her
brain might break?
BORAT
The can be strain and sometimes
pop. One of them already... she saw
something and that was complicate
for her... and I hear the noise.
He mimics the noise.
BABYSITTER
(sotto)
Oh my god.
(sarcastic)
Really?
Borat heads out the door. In Kazakh:
BORAT
See you later.
TUTAR
Don’t leave me here.
BORAT
See you later at the Titty Doctor!
He closes the door.
Alright...

BABYSITTER

EXT. PICKUP / STREET - DAY
TRANSITION DRIVING. Borat drives.

60.
BORAT (V.O.)
The operation was five hours away.
Luckily, I get hired to do a job.
EXT/INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
Borat, in GREY SUIT, is working as a HAIRDRESSER. A stiff,
cantankerous, OLD WHITE GUY, RANDY, is in the chair.
BORAT
What would you like? I can take it
all off?
CHYRON: ALAN “RANDY” KNIGHT
RANDY
Keep it where it’s, you know, above
the ears is fine.
Borat pats the guy all over his head, neck, and shoulders.
He puts SHAVING FOAM on the guy’s arms.
BORAT
Want me to shave your arms?
No.
No?

RANDY
BORAT

RANDY
No. You’re not going to shave my
hair off, are ya?
BORAT
No, no, no.
Okay.

RANDY

BORAT
I have good work. I have done...
From his pocket, he pulls out PHOTOS of his work as a barber
in Kazakhstan, mainly with livestock, and presents them.
RANDY
But you do mostly animals though,
right?

61.
BORAT
Uh, no. This Billy Sexcrime before
they remove his chram, I remove his
pubis. I was given honor.
RANDY
Oh, that’s great.
Borat snips a bit of hair and shows it to the guy.
BORAT
To you satisfaction, sir?
The guys nods. He snips another bit, presents it to him. The
guy nods.
RANDY
That’s fine.
And another bit.
RANDY (CONT’D)
That’s fine.
And again.
RANDY (CONT’D)
That’s fine.
INT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
The babysitter sits with Tutar. Tutar holds the DAUGHTER
MANUAL.
BABYSITTER
What’s in the book?
TUTAR
This is our book.
BABYSITTER
Can I read you a story?
TUTAR
You can’t read.
BABYSITTER
I can read.
TUTAR
Are you a man?

62.
BABYSITTER
No, I’m not a man.
TUTAR
Show me your putka.
BABYSITTER
I’m not showin’ you anything. But
I’m a woman.
Tutar hands over the manual.
TUTAR
This is my favorite.
BABYSITTER
(reading)
“The true story of Nadia--”
TUTAR
(correcting)
Nadia Akatov.
BABYSITTER
Okay.
(continuing)
“Who once caught a terrible disease
called curiosity. It cause her one
night to touch her vagine.”
Babysitter looks confused. Tutar cringes. ON THE BOOK PAGES.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
“Her vagine became very angry and
bit her hand.”
(noticing Tutar is
uncomfortable)
You okay?
Yes.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
It’s just a story?
TUTAR
Yes. But it a true story.
BABYSITTER
It’s a true story?
Yes.

TUTAR

63.
BABYSITTER
“Then suck all of her insides.
Where she remains to this day.”
Yes.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
This is not a true story. Okay?
TUTAR
It is a true story.
BABYSITTER
No, no, it’s not a true story. Your
vagine cannot bite. It cannot suck
your arms to a ball. It cannot do
that.
TUTAR
But my Tatti told me that. He tell
me the truth.
BABYSITTER
I mean, I understand what you’re
sayin’... that your daddy told you
that, but that’s not the real
world.
TUTAR
Are you touch your vagine?
Who, me?
Yes.

BABYSITTER
TUTAR

BABYSITTER
Have I ever touched it?
Yes.
Yes.

TUTAR
BABYSITTER

Tutar gasps in disbelief.
TUTAR
No, you can’t--

64.
BABYSITTER
Yes. Yes. And I’m here. Nothin’ ate
me up. See, I’m here. You ready?
Tutar nods.
46

INT/EXT. BABYSITTER’S CAR / STREET - MOMENTS LATER
The babysitter is driving. Tutar, wearing her BLINDERS, is
freaking out.
TUTAR
What are you doing?
BABYSITTER
We’re driving. Women can drive.
Tutar begins to cry.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry.
It’s okay.
TUTAR
You can’t drive, you can’t drive,
you can’t drive.
BABYSITTER
I can drive! I can!
TUTAR
It’s impossible for woman to drive!
BABYSITTER
Nope! Nope! No!
TUTAR
You are a man! Dressed like a woman!
No, no!

BABYSITTER

TUTAR
(screaming)
Help me!!! It’s a woman driving the
car!!!
INT/EXT. BARBER SHOP - SAME TIME
Finished with the haircut, Borat fervently dusts the man. He
kisses him on the head.

65.

Thank you.

RANDY

The man offers CASH to pay.
BORAT (V.O.)
Great success!!! I had the money!
It was now time for the surgeon to
insert Tutar’s potatoes.
Overjoyed, Borat speeds off in the pickup to the plastic
surgeon.
INT/EXT. BABYSITTER’S CAR / PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - 5:59PM
CHYRON: PLASTIC SURGERY OFFICE 5:59PM
Tutar is dropped off by the babysitter.
BABYSITTER
Did you have a good time?
Yes.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
I’m glad. What are you finna do?
TUTAR
I will get the surgery so my daddy
can give me as a present for this
American man.
BABYSITTER
What kind of surgery?
TUTAR
I will have the biggest titties in
the whole world.
BABYSITTER
Oh-kay. So you’re getting plastic
surgery at 15?
Yes.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
When you gettin’ that done?
Now.

TUTAR

66.

Now?

BABYSITTER
(shocked)

Yes.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
Wow. Do you want that?
(off her look)
Seriously?
(beat)
No, you don’t. Because you woulda
said yes.
I excite.

TUTAR

BABYSITTER
You excite, but that’s not what you
want. Okay, I don’t think you need
to do that. Because you pretty and
you young. And any man should like
you as you are. You shouldn’t want
to be anybody else... but yourself.
TUTAR
But if I have enormous titties I
don’t have to learn how to swim.
BABYSITTER
Your titties will not keep you from
drowning. You will still have to
learn how to swim.
TUTAR
They will protect me.
BABYSITTER
How will they protect you? They
titties. Titties are not gonna keep
you out to water. You are pretty.
You’re pretty!
Babysitter pulls down the sun visor mirror for Tutar to see
herself.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
Girl. Look at yourself. Look. Look.
You see yourself? Huh?
Tutar smiles.

67.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
Yes. You are beautiful. So I don’t
see anything on your body or on
your face that need to change. I
want you to be happy. I wish you
would just think about some of the
stuff I said. Think about going to
school. Use your brain. Cause your
daddy is a liar, okay?
TUTAR
My daddy is the smartest person in
the whole flat world.
Babysitter bites her tongue.
BABYSITTER
I can’t say nothin’ about that.
But, you got a big brain up there.
So use it. Just think. Because I
don’t think you need to change.
TUTAR
I will think about it.
BABYSITTER
Ay, that’s all I want, that’s all I
want. I want you to think about it.
That’s all I want from you - just
to think about it.
Tutar gets out of the car, and the babysitter drives away.
Tutar walks toward the surgeon’s office, but something
catches her eye across the street.
SHOT OF: CAR pulling up. Out comes a WOMAN. ON TUTAR.
TUTAR
(sotto)
Another woman...
Curious, Tutar walks over to investigate, carrying her BAG.
INT. MEETING ROOM NEXT TO PLASTIC SURGEON - EVENING
Tutar wanders in. It’s a “WOMEN FOR TRUMP” MINGLER.
CHYRON: HILLSBOROUGH REPUBLICAN WOMEN’S CLUB MEETING
Tutar introduces herself to the WOMEN.

68.
WOMAN 1
What’s your name?
I’m Tutar.

TUTAR

WOMAN 2
Nice to meet you, Tutar.
TUTAR
Nice meet you.
Tutar sits, joining the women.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
Do you drive a car?
WOMEN
Yes! / Oh, absolutely! / Sure!
WOMAN 2
More than one!
Tutar’s utterly shocked.
WOMAN 3
Well, not at the same time.
What?

TUTAR

WOMAN 4
We drive a car. We own cars.
A little later, Tutar talks to ANOTHER WOMAN.
TUTAR
So the mans sometimes tell lies?
WOMAN 5
Yes. A lot!
Hmm.

TUTAR

The women CONFIRM what the Babysitter told Tutar - that women
can read, have jobs, do anything that men can do... and that
men often TELL LIES.
Tutar, confused, exits and heads for the BATHROOM.

69.
INT. REPUBLICAN WOMEN’S MEETING - BATHROOM - 1 MINUTE LATER
Tutar walks down the hotel corridor and enters the ladies’
room.
Once inside, Tutar thinks about everything she’s been told
that day. She looks at NADIA AKATOV in the DAUGHTER MANUAL...
to hell with it, she’s going to risk it. She holds on to the
rail on the wall, then tentatively TOUCHES HERSELF. Her eyes
widen. SHE WASN’T SUCKED IN!!! THIS IS HUGE!!! ...And she
likes it!!!
INT. MEETING ROOM NEXT TO PLASTIC SURGEON - MINUTES LATER
Back at the conference, WOMAN 4 is mid-speech. Tutar emerges
excitedly from the bathroom.
WOMAN 4
...We’ve seen a dramatic drop in
having children produced within
wedlock. It’s a huge problem in our
society and I think part of that is
the decline of Christianity in the
United States-Tutar approaches THE PODIUM.
TUTAR
Can I say something?
WOMAN 4
Tutar! Yes. I want you to speak
now. I’d love for you to speak now.
She TAKES THE MIC.
TUTAR
This important.
The women nod, encouraging her.
WOMEN
Yes! / Great!
TUTAR
Something really strange, something
wonderful, just happen to me.
The women APPLAUD.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
I go to the toilet and I put my
index finger...
(MORE)

70.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
(shudders in delight)
...and my middle finger on my cunt.
On REACTIONS from the women.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
And I found that I wasn’t sucked in
and I wasn’t eaten!
Confused looks.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
Womans, this place is amazing. No
teeth at all.
WOMAN IN AUDIENCE
It has no what?
No teeth.
Ohhhh.

WOMEN
WOMAN IN AUDIENCE

TUTAR
It so nice, so warm. I will show
you!
(starts demonstrating)
You move this way, circle four
time, then you move up and down,
and if it’s not working you can use
this part of your hand.
(holding up the palm of
her hand)
And then you will feel something
like an explosion and then you will
finish!
Women look around, repulsed.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
Come on, take your panties off,
everyone! Please. Do you touch your
vagine?
WOMAN 4
It’s something we don’t talk about
in public...
TUTAR
Because of the Nadia Akatov story?
WOMAN 4
No, no, no.

71.
TUTAR
If that is a lie, what other lies
my daddy tell me? So, come with me!
Come with me, let’s run away from
our daddies! Let’s go and put our
hands together and touch our
vagines!
The women look around, not sure how to react.
WOMAN 1
And we’re so glad you’re here,
thank you!
She claps. Other women join in clapping.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Someone call her an Uber.
EXT. PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - SAME
Borat arrives, back in Uzbek disguise, excited. He enters the
building.
EXT. PLASTIC SURGEON’S OFFICE - 6PM
Borat comes back out and looks around, confused. Where is
she?
BORAT
(calling out)
Tutar?!
He looks across the street. There she is, silly girl. He
walks over.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Tutar, Tutar.
They stand opposite each other. An UBER behind her. Tutar is
like a rebellious teenager, full of rage.
BORAT (CONT’D)
(chuckling)
You went to the wrong address! It’s
over there.
I did not.

TUTAR

BORAT
Come on, it’s titty time.

72.
TUTAR
No, I’m not doing it!
Why not?

BORAT

TUTAR
Because I’m beautiful as I am. And
I don’t need to be given as a gift
to a man to be worth something.
BORAT
Yes, you do, it says so in the
book.
TUTAR
The Nadia Akatov story a lie.
BORAT
It not a lie. It true.
TUTAR
It is a lie. I did it.
BORAT
What? How did you escape? Out of
your asshole?
TUTAR
No. And the rest of the book is
also a lie. Look there.
(points)
It’s a woman driving a car.
ON a WOMAN DRIVING.
BORAT
That is not a woman, that is Dog
the Bounty Hunter.
Tutar sighs, not getting through to him.
TUTAR
This manual is full of lies! I
found a new book which only tells
the truth. It’s called Facebook. I
learn so many facts there. Like our
nation’s proudest moment - the
Holocaust - never happen.
BORAT
How dare you say that.

73.

Look!

TUTAR

Tutar holds up the IPHONE. On it is a Facebook Holocaust
denier page. “Holocaust is just a big lie.” ON BORAT.
No.
See?

BORAT
TUTAR

Borat clutches his chest like he’s having a heart attack. He
falls over, the Uber breaks his fall.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
I’m leaving.
She opens the Uber door to leave.
BORAT
No, you don’t. Who will lock your
cage at night?
TUTAR
I can do anything a man can do.
BORAT
No, you cannot.
TUTAR
I can even become a journalist. And
probably a better one than you,
Borat Margaret Sagdiyev!
BORAT
Who told you my middle name was
Margaret?!
TUTAR
Everyone you know! You will never
understand anything!
BORAT
I understand everything!
She grabs the DAUGHTER MANUAL.
TUTAR
You want this book?
She THROWS IT IN THE STREET.

74.

Hey!

BORAT

TUTAR
Take it! I hate it. And I hate you.
And I will never see you again.
She goes to get in the Uber.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
Oh. And by the way, I ate the
monkey. He didn’t eat himself.
BORAT
You murderer!! He was a genius!
She gets in.

Go.

TUTAR
(to driver)

BORAT
Come out now. 1... 2-The car screeches off.
BORAT (CONT’D)
No you don’t!
Borat takes off running after the car.
BORAT (CONT’D)
(calling)
STOP! THAT’S MY DAUGHTER! THAT’S MY
DAUGHTER! TUTAR!!!
As the car zooms away in the distance, Borat stops.
Despondent. [NOTE: she leaves with the phone.]
BORAT (V.O.)
My mission had failed, and I had
learn that the Holocaust was a
fairytale. Rather than return to
Kazakhstan to be execute, I decided
to take my own life. Since I did
not have money to buy a gun, I went
to the nearest synagogue to wait
for the next mass shooting...
disguised as a typical Jew.

75.
INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
Borat, comes in DRESSED AS A JEW - a MASSIVE 12 INCH NOSE,
BAT WINGS, a bag with DOLLAR SIGNS and a MARIONETTE with a
MEDIA badge. Two octogenarian LOVELY JEWISH WOMEN - DORIS and
JUDITH - are there.
Hello.

DORIS

BORAT
Uh, Jag-shalom. Are you a Jew?
DORIS
Yeah, I’m Jewish, yeah.
BORAT
Very nice weather we have been
controlling.
JUDITH
You are Jewish?
BORAT
Um...
(shaky)
Ye-- Yes.
JUDITH
No, you are not Jewish.
Listen.

JUDITH (CONT’D)

She inches closer to him. He backs away.
JUDITH (CONT’D)
Don’t be afraid of me.
BORAT
But please don’t eat me alive.
JUDITH
Do I look like I eat people?
Uh...

BORAT

JUDITH
I’m an old, good woman.
Yes...

BORAT

76.
JUDITH
Look at me. I am Jewish. Do I have
a long nose?
Borat studies her face.
No.

BORAT

JUDITH
Look at me. You can touch my nose.
What?

BORAT

Borat tentatively reaches out and touches her nose with his
JEW CLAW FINGERS.
JUDITH
You see? Is it long?
BORAT
No, it’s a small one.
JUDITH
Exactly like yours. Look at Doris.
Does she have a long nose?
BORAT
A little bit bigger than yours.
JUDITH
So, we are normal, exactly like
you.
BORAT
Okay, then, use your venom on me
and finish me. I am very depress.
JUDITH
Can I give you a hug?
As she goes in for the hug, FOREBODING MUSIC PICKS UP. Borat
stiffens.
BORAT
Don’t kill me.
JUDITH
I will not kill you. Let me give
you a kiss.
He WHIMPERS as she presses her lips to his cheek.

77.
JUDITH (CONT’D)
You see I give you a kiss and you
are still alive.
BORAT
For now I am, but maybe the venom
take longer.
JUDITH
(loving)
Oh, come on, you will be okay.
BORAT
I am hungry.
JUDITH
You are hungry?
Yes.

BORAT
CUT TO:

INT. SYNAGOGUE - 15 MINUTES LATER
Borat eats CHICKEN SOUP with the lovable women.
Good, huh?
Very good.

JUDITH
BORAT

JUDITH
Very good, huh?
(then)
I want to hear your story, my dear.
BORAT
This is the worst story that ever
happen to any human being... or
Jew. I came here on a simple
mission to save my country by
delivering by number one televiski
star, Jonny the Monkey, as a gift
to Michael Pence... and I’m sure
you’ve figured out what happen next
- my daughter had smuggled herself
into the crate - and yes, you got
it - she’d eaten the monkey...
Judith scratches her head.

78.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Although, I believe he probably eat
himself...
JUDITH
There are bad stories out there.
Listen, you want to hear my story
when I was a little child?
BORAT
Yes, what is your story?
JUDITH
I was in the Holocaust. You see me?
I was in the Holocaust.
BORAT
The Holocaust?? You were in the
Holocaust?

BORAT
It was not a fake?

79.
JUDITH
No, no my dear. It really happened.
A smile spreads across Borat’s face. He throws back his head
and lets out a laugh, his relief palpable.
BORAT
Thank you, Judy. You made me so
happy. Thank you. Thank you for
giving me...
Hope.

DORIS

Judith.
EXT. SYNAGOGUE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Overjoyed, Borat skips toward the horsebox and gets in.
BORAT (V.O.)
The Holocaust happened! My culture
was right! I had to find my
daughter immediate and deliver her
to Giuliani.
EXT. TOWN STREETS - DAY
Borat, in GREY SUIT, walks in a downtown area, confused. It’s
deserted.
SHOTS of CLOSED BUSINESSES, BARS.
BORAT (V.O.)
I search in nearby village, but for
some reason the streets were
completely empty.
Borat yells at the top of his lungs:

80.
BORAT
Tutar! Tutar!!! Stop hiding!
EXT. GUN STORE - SAME STREET - MINUTES LATER
He approaches A MASKLESS MAN - JERRY - who’s coming out of a
GUN STORE with a bunch of AMMO, BEER, and CHEETOS.
BORAT
Hello. Jagshemash. Where is
everyone? I do not see anybody on
the street.
JERRY
Everybody’s at home. They’re
tellin’ them to stay inside so they
don’t spread this virus.
BORAT
There is a viroos?
JERRY
Yes. They’re wantin’ everybody to
quarantine.
BORAT
I do not have nowhere else to go.
Could I stay your home?
Off Jerry, unable to say no...
CUT TO:
EXT/INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - NIGHT

This is it. Come on in.
CHYRON: JERRY HOLLEMAN

Nice to meet you.

JIM (CONT’D)

CHYRON: JIM RUSSELL
He sits down with his new housemates.
BORAT
How long must we be stuck in here?
JIM
Well... don’t know for sure. Until
this Covid-19 thing passes.
BORAT
What is more dangerous? This
viroos? Or the democrat?
Democrats.

JIM

Democrats.

JERRY

JERRY (CONT’D)
I think with the democrats - with
Obama - and I think it goes back to
the Clintons when they were also in
office.
BORAT
This, uh, Clinton, they make this
plague?
Yes.

JERRY

Nice!

Yes.
BORAT

JIM
Clintons are very evil.

JIM

82.
JERRY
Extremely evil.
JIM
Supposedly, they torture these
kids. It gets their adrenaline
flowing in their body. Then they
take that out of their adrenal
glands and then they drink their
blood.
JERRY
I’ve heard about things like that.
BORAT
Hillary Clinton drink the blood of
children?
JIM
That’s what we’ve heard... or I’ve
heard.
JERRY
It’s been said.
BORAT (V.O.)
Lucky for me, I was taken in by two
of America’s greatest scientists.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY
OVER MUSIC:
-- In the hallway, Jim finds Borat, in PAJAMAS, holding a
MAGNIFYING GLASS and a FRYING PAN. He’s hitting the wall with
the pan.
Sup buddy.

JIM

BORAT
I am killing some of the viroos.
JIM
No, you can’t see the virus.
BORAT
No, it’s still there.
He slams the pan against the wall.
-- In the living room, Jim now holds LYSOL SPRAY.

83.
JIM
This will kill the virus.
Jim sprays the Lysol. Borat slams the frying pan on the spot
where Jim sprayed. They do a few rounds of this.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
-- It’s 8:00am. Jerry and Jim are having a quiet morning.
Borat comes in to EXERCISE with a WALKMAN. He’s NEARLY NAKED
with a KAZAKH JOCKSTRAP/COCKPOUCH, vest, socks and PLIMSOLLS.
He’s right in their faces doing squats, lunges, and
stretching. They try to ignore him and carry on talking.
JERRY (PRE-LAP)
That don’t go in here...
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
-- Borat has filled the LAUNDRY MACHINE with DISHES (which
are now broken), FRYING PANS, A FRITOS BAG, TAKE-OUT FOOD
CONTAINERS, etc.
BORAT
But this is for wash machine.
Borat reaches in and pulls out a FLASHLIGHT.
JERRY
What is that, the flashlight?
BORAT
I get you new flashlight.
-- Borat orders a new flashlight using the ALEXA.
BORAT (CONT’D)
Alexa, order three flashlight.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
-- Borat hands out the FLESHLIGHTS when they arrive. The guys
open them. They’re HUGE.
Jim takes the cover off it. He starts to crack up.
JIM
Oh wait a minute. I don’t think
that’s a flashlight.

84.
JERRY
We ain’t got the right ones.
BORAT
What is it? I said flashlight.
JERRY
This is “FLESH.”
JIM
It’s called a FLESH-light.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - DAY
Borat and Jim are back doing more rounds of their
synchronized virus-killing technique: spray with Lysol and
slam the frying pan on it.
Borat goes overboard with the pan.
JIM
Got it. We’re done.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - DAY
Borat sits with the guys on the couch.
JERRY
The democrats, they want to hurt
and destroy this county.
BORAT
They are like demons?
Yes.
Yes.

JERRY
JIM

JIM (CONT’D)
We can’t do to them what we would
like to do because they,
unfortunately, have the same rights
we do.
BORAT
They should have a bit less rights
than you. High five!
Borat high-fives Jerry.

85.
JERRY
They should.
BORAT (V.O.)
Even though the hoax virus lockdown
was stopping me from finding Tutar,
Jim and Jerry found ways to cheer
me up.
SHOT of Jim and Jerry showing Borat how to shoot pool.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - EVENING
Another night on the couch with Jim and Jerry.
JIM
I wrote a song for you last night
so you can play it for us. It’s
called the Chinese Virus song.
Borat picks up the guitar.
BORAT
(singing)
Obama was a traitor...
JIM
America he did hate her.
BORAT
(singing)
America he hate her...
JIM
There you go.
JERRY
That’s good.
JIM
I like that.
(then)
Say “you can put him in jail.”
BORAT
(singing)
You must put him in jail...
(then, not singing)
Is he in jail?
JIM
No, but I hope so soon.

86.
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - NEXT DAY
Borat sits in the living room with the guys.
BORAT (V.O.)
But I still had not found Tutar.
And although my buddies were highly
knowledgables, they didn’t know
anything about womens.
JERRY
The women here have rights.
JIM
They can do whatever they want.
On Borat, not so sure that’s a good idea.
JERRY
They have a brain like we have a
brain. They can think and say the
same things we think and say.
Borat retrieves the DAUGHTER MANUAL to show his housemates
the FEMALE ANATOMY DIAGRAMS.
BORAT
When she born, you are given
instruction booklet made by the
Ministry of Agriculture and
Wildlife.
Borat pointing to a DIAGRAM.
BORAT (CONT’D)
The male baby come out walking. Not
the female. The male baby come out.
Look, you see.
JIM
...but they don’t.
Jerry points to ANOTHER DIAGRAM of CHILDBIRTH.
JERRY
This is supposed to be the doctors
with delivery of the baby?
BORAT
Yes. The doctor wait for the baby
to fall out and you have two other
doctor do this...
Borat points to the diagram.

87.
JIM
Well, you don’t need that-BORAT
...One in anoos, one in mouth.
No.

JIM

JERRY
What you have showed us and
explained to us, we’re sitting here
like ‘what?’
BORAT
You were looking at this and
thinking ‘what?’
Yeah.

JERRY

JIM
It’s a lie. It’s a conspiracy
theory.
Borat leans back, distressed.
BORAT (V.O.)
I was scared that I would never
find Tutar. But then something
amazings happened while I was
looking for QAnon stories with my
buddies...
INT. LOCKDOWN HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
They’re gather around the computer. Jim squints at the
screen, with his reading glasses on.
BORAT
What is this? Wait, wait, wait.
Borat bends down, points at the screen.
BORAT (CONT’D)
This look like Tutar. Her hair
different but this her. This Tutar.
ON THE SCREEN: IT’S A HARD RIGHT-WING REPORTER - Tutar, but
now she looks like an archetypal female Fox News anchor.

88.
JIM
Where are your pictures? Can I see
your pictures of her, please?
Borat pulls out the PHOTOS OF TUTAR.
JIM (CONT’D)
You know what? I’ll be god damned
if it isn’t her.
JERRY
It does look like it.
They hold up a photo against her picture on the screen.
BORAT
Screw me in the anoos. This her!
TUTAR (ON SCREEN)
Join me again on Saturday. I will
be reporting live from the state’s
biggest anti-lockdown protest.
Jim scrambles to reach for a pen and paper.
JIM
(flustered)
I gotta get a pen that fucking
works.
(reading)
March For Our Rights Rally...
JERRY

Saturday, June 27th.
JIM

BORAT
Please, please, can we go? Buddy,

lockdown and find her?
JERRY
I would think so.

89.
BORAT
But if she me -JIM
I know, that’s what I just--.
BORAT
-- then she will run. The moment
she see my face...
JERRY
You have to change your appearance.
Do somethin’ different with your
hair. Wear different clothes.
BORAT
Yes. If I in disguise, what is the
one thing that is irresistible to
all teenage girls?
Rockstars.

JERRY

JIM
What is it?
Onions.
Onions?

BORAT
JIM

BORAT

NECKLESS.
SPEAKER (O.S.)
We gotta get up and fight for this
beautiful country of the United
States of America. I don’t see very
many masks out there. That makes
you instant criminals right now.
They want to throw you in jail for
what you’re doing right here, right
now. Do you understand that?
The housemates and Borat are searching for her looking like
pedophiles.
SPEAKER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
They’re relying on you guys
continuing to sit in your houses
like good little subjects. We will
not comply!
Borat looks at the raised STAGE with HAY BAILS where the

BORAT
I’m gonna head up to the stage to

the stage, joining a BLUEGRASS BAND.
On Jim and Jerry’s reaction in the crowd.
JIM
Oh my god! He’s doin’ it. I can’t

Borat turns to the band and asks them if they know a certain
tune. He sings it softly. They nod. Borat takes the mic.

I wrote this song with my two best
buddies.
Jim and Jerry wave.

Babysitter takes off her mask.
BORAT
Can I have my ball and chain
please?
BABYSITTER
Are you finna put it back on her.

She also hands him something else.
BABYSITTER
Here you go.
BORAT
What is it?
BABYSITTER
That’s hers. One more thing that
she left.

Borat takes it. It’s the LITTLE CUPCAKE DOLL. It looks like a
MINI BORAT with GREY SUIT and drawn-on MUSTACHE.
BORAT
I have a pain in my, uh, titties.
BABYSITTER
Maybe because you givin’ away your
baby.
BORAT
Why would that make my chest hurt?

Why?

BABYSITTER
BORAT

BABYSITTER
You’re givin’ a little girl to an
old man!

It should make your heart hurt.
QUICK CUT FLASHBACKS to good memories with Tutar: her face
pressed up against the window at the fax store, her head out
the window of the pickup, high-fiving each other, trying to
get the cupcake baby out of her throat, the state fair kick
dance.
ON BORAT: he realizes he loves her.
BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
Don’t you love her? You care for
her? You care?
Borat, teary, nods.
Yes.

BORAT

BABYSITTER
Okay. So shouldn’t she make the
decision on who she marries?
BORAT
But there is only two hours left

That’s two hours. You got two hours
to stop it.
Yes.

Borat exits the hotel lobby. He needs a Plan B.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING AREA - SAME TIME
Tutar starts her questioning.
TUTAR
A little bit about China. As an
expert of national security, what
do you think we can do going
forward to prevent this from
happening again?
GIULIANI
Well, China manufactured the virus
and let it out. And they
deliberately spread it all around
the world. I don’t think anybody
was eating bats.
Yeah.

TUTAR

GIULIANI
Did you ever have a bat?

102.
TUTAR
Oh, no. I don’t think I’ll ever eat
a bat.

Okay, I will, I’ll eat a bat with
you.

The door closes.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING AREA - SAME TIME
Back with Tutar and Giuliani.
TUTAR
So probably in a rough estimate,
how many lives President Trump
saved?
GIULIANI
I’d say he saved a million lives.
It would have been a million more
had he waited that month, the way
the democrats would have done. But
he acted swiftly.
(MORE)

103.
GIULIANI (CONT'D)
He acted before anybody -- in fact,
even his own advisors, some of them
advised him not to do it.
Yeah.

TUTAR

Giuliani stops and coughs.
I’m good.

GIULIANI

He grabs his drink - a glass of whiskey.
GIULIANI (CONT’D)
A little bit?
TUTAR
Yeah, it’s always good.
She grabs hers. They CLINK glasses and laugh, playfully.
TUTAR (CONT’D)
I’ve never been in front of the
camera. I’ve always been behind of
the camera. But today, something
with this-GIULIANI
I think you’e gonna look pretty
good.
He winks and smiles.
TUTAR
We will see. But it’s because of
you.
GIULIANI
Well thank you.
TUTAR
I really feel like Melania right
now.
GIULIANI
Well, you’re doing very well!
You’re gonna look pretty-Borat enters holding a BOOM, pretending to be the SOUND
GUY/BOOM OPERATOR.

104.
BORAT
Sorry to interrupt, Mayor. Sound
problem. I think we cancel
interview.
Borat mouths to Tutar “no, don’t do it.”
TUTAR
I don’t think we need-Yeah.

GIULIANI

BORAT
I’ll just check your mic.
TUTAR
I already checked.
GIULIANI

BORAT
Yeah, that’s better. Let me just
listen in for a bit.
Borat leans down and whispers in Giuliani’s ear.
BORAT (CONT’D)
She’s not asking too many
questions?

No, no, leave. Please. If I need
you I will call you. You will be in

BORAT
Don’t do it!
TUTAR
Why? That’s what you want!
BORAT
