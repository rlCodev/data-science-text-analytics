MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING 2
Written by
Nia Vardalos

FADE IN:
EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - DAWN
Ah, it’s Fall. Not in a cozy, peaceful way. In that slushy
miserable Midwest way. Strong winds bend the trees of
Lakeshore Drive. Grey rain drips from the Magnificent Mile
storefronts to the street signs of the suburbs.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PORTOKALOS HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
The lights turn on at the Portokalos house.
CUT TO:
EXT. PORTOKALOS HOUSE - DAY, CONTINUOUS
A large old black Cadillac backs down the driveway of the
Corinthian-columned home. It drives at a wrong angle.
Stops. Drives forward, corrects. Backs out again. Corrects
again. Backs out.
The car drives ten feet and stops at the very next home.
SFX: HONKING.
That house door opens.
CUT TO:
I/E. CAR/MILLER HOUSE - DAY, CONTINUOUS
CLOSE-UP: A smudged “HAPPINESS IS BEING GREEK” Greek flag
cover on an OPA! license plate.
PAN UP....
INT. GUS’S CADILLAC/MILLER HOUSE - DAY, CONTINUOUS
SFX: Car door closing.
Through the windshield, in the passenger seat, TOULA
PORTOKALOS, 40’s, is burrowed in a scarf, her glasses fog
with every breath.

GUS
You better get married, you’re
starting to look old.
Startled, Toula looks up, realizes her dad is not talking to
her. In fact, he is looking in the rear-view mirror, at the
back seat. At Toula’s daughter.
Dad!!

TOULA
You can’t say that to her!

PARIS, Gus’s 17 year old granddaughter, pops forward, looks
at him with horror and dismay.
Pappou!!

PARIS

Gus shrugs, puts the car in gear. Toula, not looking
together this morning, or ever, shakes her head.
TOULA (V.O.)
Well, that’s a family tradition.
My dad used to say that to me and
now he just said it to my daughter.
She’s 17.
CUT TO:
EXT. MILLER HOUSE - DAY, CONTINUOUS
WIDE SHOT: The car, in front of the modest Miller home, which
is beside the Portokalos home, now drives....
TOULA (V.O.)
My family worries about each other.
We’re close. Extremely close.

decorated with all things Greek, complete with a Parthenon
Marbles door frame.
Toula’s brother, NICK PORTOKALOS, 40, waves from the window.

We see no difference between
hugging and suffocation.

Gus wags a finger.
GUS
Toula, find your daughter a Greek
boyfriend before she does what you
did.
TOULA
What the -GUS
Married a Xeno -TOULA
My husband -GUS
Not Greek, a Xeno -TOULA
How can you say that-Paris leans forward, angry at her mother.
Stop.

PARIS

Chagrined, Toula turns and looks out the windshield.
TOULA (V.O.)
Do I speak for all mothers of teens
when I ask, does it ever get
better?
Gus lowers Toula’s window, cold wind and leaves hit her in
the face.
CUT TO:
EXT. NICK’S HOUSE - DAY, CONTINUOUS
Nick’s wife, ILARIA, 30’s, pregnant, waves as her TWIN BOYS,
4, pull MARIA PORTOKALOS, 70’s, holding the “leashes” of
their harness backpacks.

GUS (O.C.)
Yeah, yeah...
Nick, a parka over a robe, runs out with COSTA, 9.
CUT TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/NICK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Gus is always thrilled at the sight of his son.
Nicko!

GUS

Nick leans in the passenger window, holds up Costa’s project
on, of course, Greece.
NICK
Hey, hey. Dad, pop the trunk, I’m
freezing my ‘nads off.
Costa climbs over Paris, squishes too close, wags a finger
like an old Greek man.
COSTA
Too much makeup.
Toula sees Paris is annoyed being schooled by a ‘tween.
GUS
Costa, did you finish drawing
Alexander the Great?
COSTA
(proudly)
Uh huh. And I sculpted a Parthenon
out of soap.
Costa holds up a crudely carved blob.

And a typed page.

COSTA (CONT’D)
Oh no, spell-check corrected
Spanakopita to Spina Bifida.
Gus lowers the back window, Nick leans in to kiss Costa, who
giggles and kisses him back.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
TOULA (V.O.)
Ah, kisses from your child. That’s
over.
Impatient to go, Gus points to a house, and drives off.
CUT TO:
EXT. ATHENA’S HOUSE/STREET - DAY, CONTINUOUS
A Greek flag waves from a post, and a la the islands, the
house is whitewashed with a bright blue dome roof. Holding
her BABY SON, ATHENA, late 40’s, and her husband YIANNI, late
40’s, appear.
TOULA (V.O.)
My sister did it right. Just as
her sons became possessed by the
teen wolf hormones, she’d just pop
out another one.
Gus honks hello.

Athena yells back into the house.

ATHENA
Move it, Aristotle!!
Athena hands the baby to Yianni, steps out on a Mykonosshaped welcome mat -- it plays the Greek National Anthem.
ARISTOTLE, 9, runs out and by Athena.
YIANNI
(yells)
Put on your hat!
CUT TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/ATHENA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Aristotle puts on his hat, crawls over Paris, squishes
between her and Costa.
ATHENA
Paris, come by the restaurant some
time.
ARISTOTLE
You should butter the garlic bread.
PARIS
Can’t wait.

CONTINUED:
ATHENA
(not getting it)
Yeah, it’s fun.
Athena licks her thumb, wipes food off Aristotle’s cheek.
Then tries to do the same to Paris’s mascara.
ATHENA (CONT’D)
Toula, you seen these eyes?
and Ian better fix that.
(nope)
Yep.
Okay bye!

You

TOULA

GUS

Gus drives as Athena yells out.
ATHENA
After school you have hockey!
Your brothers are coming so make
sure you score!
Gus drives off as Aristotle blows kisses to his mom.
GUS
You’ll score, the Greeks invented
hockey.
Paris eye rolls in the back, Toula eye rolls in the front.
But Costa and Aristotle vehemently nod.
COSTA
Yes, because what do you play
hockey on? Ice.
ARISTOTLE
What is the Greek word for ice.
Payo.
COSTA
Payo, puck, there you go.
ARISTOTLE
There you go.
GUS
There you go....
Paris and Toula scowl out the windows of the car.

CONTINUED: (2)
The NOSY/CRANKY NEIGHBOR, MRS. WHITE, 60’s, walks her dog and
grimaces as the Cadillac passes her. Gus good-naturedly
honks hello. Mrs. White jumps, then swears under her breath.
CUT TO:
EXT. CHICAGO SUBURBS - DAY
Gus’s Cadillac drives.
GUS (O.C.)
Now give me a word, any word and I
will show you how the root of that
word is Greek-Facebook!

ARISTOTLE (O.C.)
CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL STREET/STEPS - DAY
GUS (V.O.)
The Greeks invented Facebook. We
called it the telephone.
Gus’s car pulls up. The boys head to the lower school. Toula
watches Paris get out. Of course, Gus has one more nugget of
wisdom:
GUS
Paris, keep your eyeballs open now
for a nice Greek boy. Make babies,
don’t waste your eggs.
Toula winces.

Paris can barely contain her revulsion.

PARIS
Outstanding.
Paris turns to the high school.
Suddenly, Toula leaps from the car, grabs Paris.

TOULA

Paris, Pappou didn’t mean to say
anything hurtful, you’re beautiful,

the COOL STUDENTS, including TIAHN, CLIFFORD, all 17.
And, BENNETT, 17.

Toula doesn’t see the effect he has on Paris.
Paris turns to glare at Toula.

Toula stops talking, stares at her daughter.

She is alone.

TOMMY
Ooh, drama.
Toula blinks, looks up at:
A banner hangs: COLLEGE FAIR TONIGHT.

EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - DAY
The downtown Loop in the distance, the Cadillac drives
through Greek Town.
CUT TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/CHICAGO STREETS (THE PRESENT)
Gus drives, as Toula thinks.
TOULA (V.O.)
I guess when my daughter started to
pull away, I should have stepped
back.
CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL GYM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
PACKED volleyball game. Paris is a Line Judge. Wearing a
PARENT VOLUNTEER sticker, Toula works the SNACKS TABLE on the
side.
TOULA (V.O.)
But I stayed too close. I kept
volunteering at her school. I
wanted her to think I was cool
again.
Toula keeps waving to Paris, who wishes she would go away.
Then, a volleyball smacks Toula in the head. She drops. The
GYM of PEOPLE sucks in air. Paris cringes at the attention.
Toula is on the ground.

(CONTINUED)

10
CONTINUED:
TOULA (V.O.)
Then I remembered I’ve never been
cool.
MARGE and EDIE, 40’s, the overbearing Volunteer Moms, smirk
into their hands. STUDENTS, including Tommy, are quietly
giggling. ThenTOMMY (O.C.)
Here comes the principal.
The principal is backlit. It’s IAN MILLER, 40’s, and even
though he looks worn down by the teen years, he is handsome.
TOULA (V.O.)
My husband has always been cool.
He just has it. And he always knows
what to say.
Ian leans in.
IAN
You okay, babe?
Toula sits up, nods, sees: Paris looks at her with disdain.
DISSOLVE TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/CHICAGO STREETS - DAY (THE PRESENT)
Remembering this, Toula winces.
TOULA (V.O.)
Just when my daughter doesn’t want
me around anymore, my parents need
me more than ever.
Gus, driving, nods off.

Toula nudges his chin, he wakes up.

Toula sees they pass the SENIORS’ REHAB CENTER.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. REHAB CENTER WAITING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY (FLASHBACK)
TOULA (V.O.)
So I take them to get groceries, to
their doctors, and to Physical
Therapy.
Toula waits: through the glass, Gus does hip therapy.

Toula blows off dust from a peanuts bowl.

Eats some.

The receptionist, DOMINIQUE, looks up.
DOMINIQUE
The old guys suck the chocolate off
those nuts.
Toula spits nuts.
CUT TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/OLYMPIC TRAVEL - DAY (THE PRESENT)
Gus drives past closed-down buildings, one with two tattered
signs: OLYMPIC DRY CLEANING, and OLYMPIC TRAVEL AGENCY.
Toula sees the sign.
TOULA (V.O.)
I used to love being a travel
agent. But in a tight economy the
first things to go are luxuries
like travel and dry cleaning.
CUT TO:
I/E. GUS’S CADILLAC/DANCING ZORBA’S - DAY
The car pulls up to the family restaurant, DANCING ZORBA’S.
TOULA (V.O.)
Luckily, people still eat.
Toula gets out, then helps her dad as he slowly gets himself
out. Toula pulls a walking cane from the car. Gus looks
around to be sure no one sees this, reluctantly takes it.
Toula holds his arm as they walk. Gus slips, bumps into
Toula, knocking off her glasses. Gus steps, accidentally
crunching them to bits.
CUT TO:
INT. DANCING ZORBA’S - DAY
Toula now squints, flips on the lights, hangs up their coats.
Gus, exhausted already, limps to the corner booth.
Toula hangs a worn sign in the window: WE NOW CATER, TOO!

(CONTINUED)

12
CONTINUED:
TOULA (V.O.)
My sister and brother have small
children, so I help at the
restaurant. It’s what nice Greek
girls do.
Toula puts on a mud-brown Seating Hostess jacket.
Toula walks past a pie case filled with mini-bundt cakes,
each with a Fall-colored orange or cranberry gerbera in its
center.
TOULA (V.O.)
Families that are close like mine,
we make it through bad economies,
wars and sickness because we stick
together...
Toula goes to a drawer, finds a strip of empty disposable
contact lenses. She remembers something, and rummages to
find a pair of glasses. They’re ugly and they were once
hers. She puts them on.
Toula looks as downcast and frumpy as she once did.
TOULA (V.O.)
... but some of us just get stuck.
Toula looks out the window. Cars and PEOPLE pass her by. The
day is as bleak as her mood.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
In the exact same stance as her mother Toula, Paris stands,
looking out the window.
SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS huddle at lockers.
She turns and heads into:

Paris is alone.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY
Paris takes a book from a bookshelf -- Ian walks up.
IAN
Hey Paris --

13
CONTINUED:
PARIS
Do not talk to me.
I’m a narc.

People think

IAN
I -- shouldn’t you be in class?
PARIS
You track me all day! Mom is
needy, Pappou wants to marry me
off, Yiayia constantly tells me to
never, ever let a boy touch my
poulaki because once he feels it,
he wants it. Ugh, this family!
STUDENTS look over at the voices from the bookshelf.
TOMMY
Save it for the therapist’s couch.
Riiiiiight?
He goes for a high five which no one returns.
IAN
Paris, your mom once felt the same
way about being Greek-PARIS
Dad, that’s obtuse, why would I
have an issue being Greek?
Paris points behind her to 5 cheerful posters declaring
upcoming meetings: Syrian Club!, Korean Club, Greek Club!,
Gay & Lesbian Club!, Handi-Capable Club!
PARIS (CONT’D)
I can’t take that everyone is
always in my business! Give me
some air. I’m not a kid, I can be
late to a class, there won’t be a
spasmodic catastrophic ripple in
the space-time continuum. And yes,
four of those words are Greek.
Paris storms away, Ian looks worn out.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
BOOTHS line the walls. Fresh-faced REPS, from colleges from
Harvard to Phoenix University, talk to STUDENTS and PARENTS.
Slapping on a PARENT VOLUNTEER sticker, Toula looks for Ian,
sees those overbearing moms, Marge and Edie, and ducks back.
They intercept her.
Hey, hi!

TOULA

Marge and Edie click their pens, tap their clipboards.
MARGE
Where were you when we set up?
TOULA
Sorry, my pipes froze -EDIE
And decorated the gym -TOULA
I had to plunge the sink -They stare her down, clicking their pens.
MARGE
You’re on Clean-Up.
Marge hands Toula a garbage can, they leave as Ian walks up.
Hi.

IAN

Having been married 17 years, they barely look at each other.
Hi.

TOULA

Ian takes the garbage can from Toula, shakes his head.
IAN
You can say no to them.
Toula laughs ruefully.

Sure.

TOULA

IAN
Babe, it’s been a long time since
those two made fun of your lunch -Toula winces, remembering.
TOULA
They called it moose-caca.
Ian nods, he’s heard it before.
Toula sees and points to Paris:
IAN
There’s Paris ....
Paris moves to the next booth: NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY.
IAN (CONT’D)
Hey, if she goes to Northwestern,
she’ll stay in Chicago!
TOULA
Please, oh please.

Nuh uh.

Should we go

IAN

Ian gently pulls Toula back.
Right.

TOULA

MARIA (O.C.)
There she is!
Toula’s face freezes.
No no.

Did she just hear her mother?

TOULA

her HUSBAND and TWO SONS, 20’s, Nick, Costa, Athena,

Maria pounces on horrified Paris.
MARIA

Nikki pulls a COMB from her Hairdressers’s work smock.
NIKKI

As the family gives their opinions to Paris, Gus nudges Ian,
points to all the BOYS in the family.
GUS
Ian, look, everyone has boys.

Now Gus and Uncle Taki are on a bench.
GUS

UNCLE TAKI

Everyone from that island has six

met my goal. Where’s Taki? He
never answers his phone.
MARIA
(wryly)
Why stand when you can sit?
Maria points to Gus and Uncle Taki on the bench.
Gus and Uncle Taki see their wives looking over at them.
GUS
Look tired so they’ll leave us
alone.
Gus and Uncle Taki slump.
AT THE BOOTH:
NICK
Hey Angelo, you get my flatscreen

Angelo raps Nick in the groin, they laugh and wrestle.
Costa grabs his cousin Aristotle and they do the same.

The women put their hands on the back of each other’s necks,
pulling back each other’s neck skin so their faces look
younger.
Paris is horrified.
Toula sees Paris watch STUDENTS walk around her giant family.
CLIFFORD
Hey, Bennett.

There you go.
From the next booth, Gus doesn’t look up from his newspaper.

Nikki and Athena place a plate of sandwiches at the window.
Toula passes sandwiches to the men, puts one on a plate,

Hey...

TOULA

Paris doesn’t look up.

Toula indicates herself.

TOULA (CONT’D)
Um, just because you don’t want
this to be your job when you’re my

Why do parents always say, “dream

Toula cannot deny this is true.
Gus walks by, coughs into his hand.

I can fix it myself.
Gus waves her off, points to a chair, Toula sits.
TOULA
Please don’t lecture me about my

GUS
No, where they came from.
Oh.
Gus nods.

TOULA
The Find Your Ancestry site?

Toula types it in.

Gus looks at the site.

GUS
Ha! I’m going to prove to your
mother that I’m related to
Alexander the Great. Don’t tell
her.
He holds a finger to his lips, shhh, it’s a secret.
TOULA
No noooo. You’ll have to type in

300 BC. You get frustrated just
adding up checks.

CLOSE-UP: the signature line is empty.
Gus is confused.

Nikki unzips her top, grins.

Aunt Voula turns to Uncle Taki.

Lucky we got married in Athens.
They cross themselves.
Uncle Taki picks up the paper -- no signature.

Toula rubs Ian’s shoulders.
You okay?

That’s my brother, Panos!

Gus, the kids, they did it for you.
Uncle Taki takes a BOTTLE OF OUZO and SHOT GLASSES, goes out

Gus is upset.
IAN
Gus, the family pooled their
airline points.
GUS
Ian, you don’t know this, you’re
not successful like me. When you
do well, you become a sign of hope
for the optimist. But to the
pessimist, you represent the stench
of their own failure. Those people
hate you for their life choices.
IAN
It was a long time ago.

What do you mean by that?!
Ian does a double-take.

Panos quickly turns back.

PANOS
You know what I mean!
Ian gets out of the way.
GUS
My son works hard, he deserves a
house!
PANOS
And I don’t?!
GUS
You could have had this -PANOS
