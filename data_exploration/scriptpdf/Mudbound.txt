Based on the international bestselling novel
by Hillary Jordan

OVER BLACK we hear the distant rumble of THUNDER.
FADE IN:
TIGHT ON THE FACE OF JAMIE MCALLAN (Caucasian, 20’s)
Black eye. Cut lip. He looks like a beaten prize fighter
who is dripping in sweat and mud. WIDEN TO REVEAL we are...
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM - IN A HOLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The ash colored storm clouds make it look like night. Jamie
scrapes the muck off his shovel blade and resumes. The mud
is so thick it’s like digging into raw meat.
A distant lightning flash accompanied by THUNDER. Jamie ups
his urgency as he chops at the wet earth. An upside down
face appears in the hole’s opening. It’s HENRY MCALLAN
(Caucasian, late 40’s), Jamie’s salt-of-the-earth, older
brother. Henry is a man of few words who rarely smiles.
They speak with the lilting garble of the Mississippi Delta.
My turn.

HENRY
Take a break.

JAMIE
We ain’t gonna make it.
We will.

HENRY
We have to.

Henry extends his hand and helps Jamie out of the hole.
Then, as Henry maneuvers his way into the hole we see that he
moves with a noticeable limp. Jamie pulls a handkerchief
from his pocket and wipes mud from his face and hands. As he
watches Henry dig we hear Jamie’s VOICE OVER:
JAMIE (V.O.)
We will. We have to. That was my
brother, Henry: absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.
The weather would dry out in time
to resow the cotton. Next year
would be a better year. We would
get this hole dug before the storm
hit.
(beat)
And his little brother would never
betray him.
LIGHTNING and THUNDER. Jamie looks up and sees angry, black
clouds eating up the sky. Then from inside the hole we hear
a CLANG as Henry’s shovel hits something hard.

2.

Dammit.

HENRY

JAMIE
What is it?
HENRY
Piece of rock, I think.
Henry shoves his hand into the mud to pull out the rock. But
what he retrieves is actually a human skull missing a big
chunk in the back. They trade a look. Henry keeps digging,
alternating between shovel and bare hands as he discovers the
rest of the skeleton. A collarbone, scapula and ribs.
HENRY (CONT’D)
No, no, no. Oh Lord... It ain’t
right. This just ain’t right.
Henry digs out the pelvis and leg bones. We hear a metallic
CLINK. Henry unearths the tibia and sees a crude, rusted
iron shackle with a broken chain dangling from it.
Jesus.

HENRY (CONT’D)
This is a slave’s grave.

JAMIE
You don’t know that.
HENRY
See here? Shot in the head.
Must’ve been a runaway.
(extending a grimy hand)
That settles it. Help me out.
JAMIE
Settles what?
HENRY
I won’t bury our father in a
slave’s grave. There’s nothing he
would’ve hated more.
JAMIE
We don’t have a choice.
More LIGHTNING and THUNDER.
The brothers hold a look.

Henry knows Jamie is right.
TIME CUT TO:

3.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM - THE HOLE - DAY - LATER
The hole has grown longer and deeper and is now a foot over
Jamie’s head - a proper grave. Henry’s face appears in the
opening of the hole:
HENRY
Yep, that should do it.
Jamie hands the shovel up. But then, when Henry tries to
help Jamie out, it’s no use. The hole is too deep, their
hands are too wet and the walls are too slick.
HENRY (CONT’D)
I’ll fetch the ladder.
Jamie nods and Henry moves off. As the squelch of Henry’s
boots steadily grows quiet we see the pain and worry in
Jamie’s eyes. All around him is oozing mud. And overhead is
a crude rectangle of darkening gray.
Then we hear the staccato pitter-patter of RAIN DROPS. Jamie
looks up and they begin to hit his face. At first just a
few, but then they come faster. Jamie tries to climb out
again. But he slips back in. Another try and this time he
almost makes it before sliding back down.
Jamie’s panic rises as he tries to claw out of the hole. But
it’s futile as his fingers cut through the mud like butter.
Henry!

JAMIE
HENRY!!

The rain falls harder as the storm hits it’s stride. And the
hole is already starting to fill with water. Jamie’s eyes
grow wild as he suddenly throws himself against the walls
like a trapped animal.
ON HENRY
As he limps back towards the hole with the ladder, he hears
Jamie screaming.
HENRY!!

JAMIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Henry hustles back to the hole but Jamie is too frantic to
notice.
Jamie!!

HENRY
Jamie, I’m here!!

4.
Jamie snaps out of it as Henry lowers the ladder. Jamie
scrambles up and promptly doubles over trying to quell the
panic.
HENRY (CONT’D)
You alright?
JAMIE
I thought maybe you decided to
leave me down there.
HENRY
Why would I do that?
Jamie glances up. Henry’s looking at him like he’s crazy.
Jamie hauls up the ladder and moves off:
Come on.

JAMIE
Let’s get this over with.

INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - DAY
ON PAPPY MCALLAN (60’S), eyes closed, his expression
tranquil. He is dressed as we will see him throughout, in
his Sunday best. WIDEN TO REVEAL Jamie and Henry standing
over him. Henry pulls a sheet over Pappy’s face then regards
the ramshackle coffin made of mismatched scrap wood.
HENRY
I wish to hell we’d been able to
get to town.
Jamie moves to Pappy’s feet and Henry to his head as they get
to putting the body in the coffin. As they lift:
HENRY (CONT'D)
Gently now.
JAMIE
Right, wouldn’t want to hurt him.
HENRY
(sharp)
That’s not the point.
JAMIE
Sorry, brother. I’m just tired.
With ludicrous care they lower the corpse into the box.
Henry reaches for the lid and starts to put it on:
Go on.

HENRY
I’ll finish up here.

5.
Jamie nods and throws a last look at the corpse. We STAY WITH
him as he drifts outside to the porch. A HAMMER STRIKING A
NAIL gives him pause. He produces an almost empty bottle of
bourbon from his back pocket. He downs it.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - DAY
The rain and wind have slowed down. ON A PAIR OF BOOTS as
they trudge through thick, ankle-deep mud. WIDEN TO REVEAL
that the boots belong to LAURA MCALLAN (Caucasian, 30’s).
She follows Jamie and Henry who carry the coffin. Laura is
more plain than pretty and there’s a tired strength in her
eyes. She stumbles in the muck and we hear her VOICE OVER:
LAURA (V.O.)
When I think of the farm I think of
mud. Encrusting knees and hair.
Marching in boot shaped patches
across the floor. I dreamed in
brown.
The procession arrives at the grave. Henry and Jamie set the
coffin down and work ropes underneath it as Laura looks on.
The ropes slip, the coffin tumbles to the ground. Wood
GROANS and there’s a loud CRACK from inside.
Dammit.

HENRY

JAMIE
What if we stand at either end and
run the ropes lengthwise?
HENRY
Coffin’s too narrow. It falls
again it could break open.
Jamie shrugs, “so what?”
No.

HENRY (CONT’D)

Laura reacts to a mule pulled wagon she sees approaching.
LAURA
The Jacksons.
As the wagon gets closer we see the JACKSONS: HAP and
FLORENCE ride up front with their youngest RUEL (10). Behind
them their children, MARLON (15) and LILLY MAY (12). Henry
moves towards them:
LAURA (CONT’D)
Henry, don’t.

6.
HENRY
S’not my fault what happened.
LAURA
Just let them go.
HENRY
Leaving us in the middle of the
season? Least they can do is lend
a hand.
Laura and Jamie trade a look as Henry waves the wagon down.
Hap’s eyes are tight and cold as he clucks the horses to a
stop. Laura ventures a nod at Florence, Florence ignores her.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Can you help us out here?
Hap considers Jamie. The cracked coffin sinking into the mud.
Hap?

HENRY (CONT’D)

Florence puts a hand on Hap’s hand. They look to each other
for an answer that isn’t there. Laura shifts her weight,
looks away from Henry.
LAURA (V.O.)
I was a thirty one year old virgin
when I met Henry McAllan in the
Spring of 1939.
INT. LAURA’S MEMPHIS HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
ON LAURA, mud-free and squeaky clean. She is smiling coyly
and we WIDEN TO REVEAL that she’s sitting across from Henry
who is quiet and inscrutable throughout. The other guests at
the dinner table: Laura’s brother, TEDDY (late 20’s) and her
MOTHER and FATHER (50’s). This place is a sharp contrast to
the farm. It’s light and pristine with clean napkins and
crisp, white shirts. Laura’s V.O.:
LAURA (V.O.)
I lived with my parents in the
house I grew up in. My world was
small and he was my rescuer from a
life in the margins.
Laura’s mother has sniffed out the sparks between Laura and
Henry. Mom gives Henry the hard sell with a smile as Laura
squirms in the spotlight.

7.
LAURA’S MOTHER
Oh, an engineering degree from Ole
Miss? Laura’s a college graduate,
got her teaching certificate from
West Tennessee State.
TEDDY
Oh, my dear sister’s the smartest
one in the family. Made better
grades than I ever did.
(winking to Henry)
Never heard the end of it.
LAURA’S MOTHER
Laura, why don’t you play some
piano after dinner.
(to Henry re: Laura)
You really must hear her sing.
(to Laura)
You should play something for Mr.
McAllan later.
Momma.

LAURA

LAURA’S MOTHER
How about that hymn y’all did at
service last Sunday? Or Ave Maria,
that’s beautiful.
Momma.
What?

LAURA
LAURA’S MOTHER

LAURA
I’m quite sure that Teddy did not
bring his new boss, Mr. McAllan,
over to hear hymns.
LAURA’S MOTHER
Well, let’s ask him then. Mr.
McAllan, would you like to hear
some music later?
Eyes turn to Henry as he finishes a bite of food and wipes
his mouth.
HENRY
I like hymns.
Laura, de-centered.

INT./EXT. LAURA’S MEMPHIS HOME - NIGHT
Laura opens the door to REVEAL Henry with a bouquet of
flowers. She smiles, surprised.
LAURA (V.O.)
I was unused to male admiration and
knew only that I wanted more. It
was at least a reprieve from the
sincere pity and insincere kindness
directed at old maids.

LAURA (V.O.)
He didn’t feel the need to fill the
air with words like I did. He had
the self confidence I lacked. He
was, after all, a veteran of the
Great War.
EXT. OVERTON PARK - DAY
Henry and Laura walk hand in hand. The dogwood trees are
blooming and flurries of white petals flit on gentle breezes.
Henry picks a petal out of Laura’s hair and they hold a look.
LAURA (V.O.)
Though he never spoke of it, his
limp was a constant reminder of his
brave sacrifice. I can’t say that
I was truly in love with him, but I
was so grateful to him it dwarfed
everything else...
Henry takes her face in his hands, grinds a kiss onto her
mouth. Laura recovers, tries a smile, waits for some
tenderness, a grand romantic declaration-HENRY
My brother, Jamie’s coming up from
Oxford in a few weeks. I’d like
for him to meet you.

Henry scans the crowd, smiles.

HENRY (CONT’D)

Henry points. Jamie strides through the crowd. He is fresh,
clean, beautiful. Henry moves to him as fast as limp will
permit. A warm, rocking hug. They step back and study each
other’s faces.

You look good, brother.
Likewise.

LAURA
Pleased to meet you.
JAMIE
The pleasure is all mine.
With exaggerated gallantry, Jamie takes Laura’s offered hand
and kisses it.
HENRY
He thinks he’s a character in one
of his plays.
LAURA
Henry tells me you’re studying
theater at Ole Miss.

Ah, but which play, dear brother?

HENRY
Hopefully one of them fellas can

Laura’s not the impressionable

Then what happened?
JAMIE
I saw a glimmering light. Like a
fallen star.
(wiggling his fingers)
And a great big hand reached out of
it. Thought it was God himself
come to take me. But it wasn’t.
It was my dear big brother, Henry.
LAURA
(smiling to Henry)
You saved his life. You’re a hero.
JAMIE
He is indeed.
HENRY
What else was I supposed to do?
Let him drown?
It’s not a pleasant memory for Henry.

That’ll do-JAMIE

Henry, I’ve got more stamina than
you-Jamie tips the servant’s hands, extends the pour.
HENRY
What, from modeling clothes? Don’t
know how you do that. Seems so
undignified for a man.

12.
JAMIE
We’ll have plenty of time later for
you to evaluate my life choices,
brother. Tonight, we celebrate.
(raising his glass)
Here’s to the future. Whatever it
may hold. May you be blessed with
happiness, health, prosperity
and...
(to Henry re: Laura)
...if she’ll have you, maybe even a
house full of children. My love to
you both.
Said genuinely. Laura is touched. Despite himself, Henry is
too. They clink glasses and drink.
LAURA
Ooh, bubbly.
Just then the band switches the beat and ups volume. It’s
time to dance. As couples start to move to the dance floor
Jamie looks to Henry:
JAMIE
Would you mind terribly if I had a
dance with your girl?
(off Henry’s shrug)
Miss Chappell? Care to take a
spin?
Laura looks to Henry, Henry nods.
ON THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Jamie and Laura whirl. Jamie’s got Fred Astaire moves. But
this is new to Laura and she’s awkward. Jamie patiently
leads and soon Laura’s swept off her feet. For a while it
feels like it’s just the two of them out there.
LAURA (V.O.)

his eyes were on me, I felt like I
was no longer invisible.
Laura and Jamie lock eyes and the connection is overwhelming.

HENRY
You look especially pretty tonight.
Thank you.

LAURA

HENRY
Jamie has that effect on girls.
They sparkle for him.

He likes you. I can tell.
LAURA
I’m sure he doesn’t dislike anyone.
HENRY
At least not anyone in a skirt.
(re: the dance floor)
See what I mean?
Laura looks and sees Jamie on the dance floor with a PRETTY
GIRL. The girl effortlessly follows Jamie through a series
of turns and dips. Laura suddenly feels foolish and tries to
cover it as she sips her champagne glass empty. Henry refills
it.
LAURA (V.O.)
Henry’s marriage proposal didn’t
play out like I’d pictured it
would. He wasn’t kneeling and the
question actually came out as more
of a statement. Henry wasn’t a
romantic. He was made of sturdier
stuff. But he was a good, hard
working man. And he loved me. And
I knew that he would provide, be
true, and give me children. And
for that, I could certainly love
him in return.
Laura steals glances at Jamie dancing and smiling.

Then, in a MONTAGE we see Laura around the house cooking,

LAURA (V.O.)
Yielding to Henry and waiting for
him to come home to me was what I’d
been put on earth to do.

A gathering of NEIGHBORS in the tidy yard. Ronsel in crisp
TRAVELING CLOTHES, his sister, Lilly May, hanging on his
neck.
LILLY MAY
Don’t forget about us.

RONSEL
You know I won’t.
Marlon steps forward with a brave face, pumps his brother’s
hand, claps his back. Little brother Ruel follows suit.
MARLON
Take care Ron.

We will.

MARLON

RONSEL
And keep them no ‘count boys away

Lilly May smiles through her sniffles, pops Ronsel on the
shoulder as she steps back. Marlon does a little salute. Hap
looks on from the driver’s seat of his rough-idling truck,
pride and doubt competing for his eyes.
Ronsel slings his pack over his shoulder, ambles over to
where Florence holds herself against the cab. She puts her
hand on his forehead, cups his face, holds her hand over his
beating heart. Bomp. Bomp. Bomp. He’s alive. Ronsel holds
Florence’s hand over his heartbeat.
FLORENCE
You just come back.
RONSEL
I will Mama.
FLORENCE
You come all the way back.
Ronsel kisses her hand. Florence pats his chest and peels
herself away. Neighbors and family surge forward as Hap eases
the truck away, spill into the dirt road waving and
whistling. But Florence doesn’t look back.
FLORENCE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I can’t look back. I didn’t look
back. It’s bad luck to watch
somebody leave.

Florence throws open the back door. Beyond a small green
garden, COTTON FIELDS stretch infinitely from her yard post.
Hap and Marlon are slow-moving specks on the horizon.
Florence raises her hand in a wave.

Hap in the pulpit, sweating and quaking and exalting. Swaying
trees visible through the missing boards behind him. A breeze

FLORENCE (V.O.)
I love them all equally. Every
mother does. But during all those
four years, all that time he was

HENRY (V.O.)

grab up a handful of dirt from the

what’s this I’ve got in my hand?”
“Dirt” , I says. Then he says “Naw
boy, this is LAND I’ve got. Do you
know why?”
Henry sniffs the dirt in his hands, tastes it, spits it out.
HENRY (V.O.)
And he says “because I OWN it. It’s
mine. And one day it’ll be yours.
But in the meantime, to you and
every other person who doesn’t own

Henry tosses the dirt away.

HENRY (V.O.)
Except that land never became mine.
Pappy sold it after the flood. He

Pappy stops and takes a long look down at the body. Henry

I mentioned it.

No, Henry. I had no idea.

HENRY
Well. I’m telling you now. We’ve
got ourselves two hundred acres of
fertile land. And with that
tractor I don’t need a bunch of
sharecroppers, I can do most of the
work myself.
LAURA
What about my family?
HENRY
Me and the girls are your family.
LAURA
I mean my mother and father.
HENRY
They can visit. You can too.

LAURA
But...three weeks?
HENRY
Laura, honey, in a year’s time I’ll

another hundred acres. Man up the

It’s even more charming than Henry described. The procession
unfolds from the caravan.
Henry watches Laura as she takes it in. She looks at Henry
and softens, the house is lovely. He moves to her and takes
her hand as they walk towards their new home.
AMANDA LEIGH
Mommy flowers!
LAURA
I see, honey.

You didn’t tell me we had azaleas.
So we do.

Isabelle coughs as she curls deeper into mommy.
LAURA
She’s done in. Let’s get inside.
HENRY
Key should be under the mat.

Just then the the front door opens to REVEAL a big, bear of a
man, ORRIS STOKES (Caucasian, 30’s). He’s not friendly.
STOKES
Who the hell are you?
HENRY
We’re the McAllans. The new
tenants of this house. Who are
you?
STOKES
Orris Stokes. The new owner of
this house.
HENRY
I rented this place from George
Suddeth just three weeks ago.
STOKES
Suddeth sold me the house last
week. And he didn’t say nothing
‘bout no renters.
HENRY
Is that a fact? I guess I need to
refresh his memory.
STOKES
He left town three days ago.
HENRY
I gave him a hundred dollar
deposit.
PAPPY
You get anything in writing?
HENRY
We shook on the deal.
Pappy spits on the ground, shakes his head in disgust.
HENRY (CONT’D)
I paid him a hundred dollars cash
right there in the living room. I
had dinner with him and his wife.
STOKES
You best be getting on.
Orris shuts the door behind him.

PAPPY
You got swindled, boy.

Damn fool.

Henry is crestfallen. Another cough from Isabelle. Off the
whole group looking to Henry.
HENRY
Then we’ll have to stay on the
farm. There’s a house. We can
make it work.
PAPPY
You mean out there with the niggers
and the farm hands?
HENRY
It’s the only place big enough for
all of us. There’s nothing else in
town. Believe me, I looked.
EXT. A RUTTED ROAD - DAY
The McAllan’s two-car convoy rocks and bumps their way down
the road. The land is flat and mostly featureless. African
American men, women and children dot the fields, tilling the
earth with mule drawn plows.
Eventually they pass run down sharecropper’s shacks with dirt
yards. African American women hang clothes on lines as
children play or watch the procession from porches.
EXT. JACKSON CABIN - SUNSET
Hap surveys his land. Ruel and Marlon toil shoulder to
shoulder in the fading light. Florence and Lily May chip away
at the day’s chores.
HAP (V.O.)
What good is a deed? My
grandfathers and great-uncles,
grandmothers and grand-aunts,
father and mother--broke, tilled,
toiled, planted, plucked, razed,
burned, broke again. Worked this
land all their lives. This land
that would never be theirs. They
worked until they sweated. They
sweated until they bled. They bled
until they died. Died with the dirt
of this same 200 acres underneath
they fingernails. Died, clawing at
the hard brown back that would
never be theirs. All they deeds
undone.

Yet this man, this place, this law,

and sweat and dying with dirt under
your fingernails don’t count.
Doesn’t make it yours. Say you need
a deed, not Deeds. So what good is
a deed? A deed is a piece of paper.
One of my great-uncles, Uncle
William, got ahold of a piece of
land during reconstruction. A good
piece of land right next to the
river. He had a deed. Had his piece
of paper and all. Four white men
rode up on horses one day, aimed
they pistols, said it was theirs.
My uncle’s good deed torn into
forty pieces and thrown to the
wind. It was too good, you see? The
land he had claimed. And so I ask:
what good is a deed?
EXT. RICKETY BRIDGE - DAY

HAP (V.O.)
That mule made me a share tenant,
not a share cropper. And it had me
dreaming about having my own piece

Hap saunters back to his cabin, luxuriates in the calm of a
completed day’s work.
INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - SUNSET
Hap and his family shoulder to shoulder around an overflowing
dinner table. Cabbage and onions from Florence’s garden. A
cast iron skillet with rabbit in heavy brown gravy. A plate
of sliced tomatoes goes around. A SURVEYOR’S MAP with
outlined parcels is pinned to the wall. A pencil on a string
hangs from a nail next to it. Hap stares at it as he eats.
Hap leaps up, napkin still tucked around his neck to redraw a
boundary, scribble notes.

All eyes on Hap. The dividing wall between what was a twofamily unit has been cut and framed with a door that extends
the Jacksons cozy living space. BANG BANG BANG. Marlon starts
to rise, Hap motions him to sit. Hap palms a MACHETE that
leans just inside the door, holds it close behind his leg
before cracking opening it.
Henry, fist still raised in a knock squinting back at his
ragtag caravan.

INT. HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY
Hap bounces uncomfortably between Henry and Pappy. Hap looks
down and sees that his hand is ever so close to Pappy’s. Hap
shifts and we hear his VOICE OVER:
HAP (V.O.)
Mist McAllan was from Memphis and
my guess was he didn’t know the
eating end of a mule from the
crapping end. Told me he intends
to bring in one of them infernal
tractors. Imagine that, using a
machine to work his land instead of
the hands the Lord gave him. This
man put three families off on
account of that damn tractor. But I
thank God we wasn’t one of them.
Most times a landlord puts the
colored families off first.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - EVENING
The house is a large rickety shack with a deserted air. It
has a warped tin roof and shuttered windows with neither
glass nor screens. A porch runs the length of the house and
connects it to a small lean-to. There is a dirt yard with a
pump. A barn, pig wallow, chicken coop and a pasture.
The two car convoy rolls to a ragged stop. Henry, Laura,
Pappy, Hap, Amanda Leigh and Isabelle pile out. Laura is
mortified. So is Pappy. Amanda Leigh goes running.
AMANDA LEIGH
Will we have chickens, daddy?
You bet.

HENRY
Pigs too.

A recent rain has turned the ground to muck. Laura steps
into an ankle-deep mud puddle and loses her footing. She
sucks her foot out, her nice shoes are ruined.
HAP
You alright, Ms. McAllan?
LAURA
I’m fine, thank you.
Henry swoops Amanda Leigh into his arms and continues, though
it’s more for Laura’s benefit:

28.
HENRY
You know what else, jitter bug?
That river we crossed over? I bet
it’s full of catfish and crawdads.
PAPPY
Better git ‘im to replace them
shutters or we might freeze to
death.
HAP
I thought you was planning to live
in town, suh.
HENRY
Plans changed.
AMANDA LEIGH
Momma, I have to tinkle.
LAURA
Okay, sweetheart, come on.
Laura starts heading towards the house but Henry stops her:
HENRY
Uh, honey, it’s around back.
LAURA
Around back?
HENRY
It’s an outhouse. There’s
no...indoor plumbing.
Henry points to a water pump not far off. Laura is
incredulous. Henry’s eyes urge her to make the best of it.
Hap’s presence makes Henry squirm even more. Thunder rumbles
in the distance.
CUT TO:
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
The roof leaks in several spots. Henry and Hap back in with
Laura’s piano. Pappy sits on a rocking chair, smoking as he
watches.
HENRY
Relax yourself Pappy.

Laura bustles out of one of the bedrooms. She rifles through
a box.

29.
LAURA
The girls are done in. I need their
blankets.
As Laura tries to get to a particular chest she accidentally
knocks over a box of books and they go tumbling out. Hap
rushes over and helps pick the books up.
LAURA (CONT’D)
Just stack them in the corner.
HAP
Yes, ma’am.

A Tale of Two Cities. Wuthering

There’s no room in the house.
PAPPY
If you got rid of that piano we
could put a bed right there.
HENRY
True. We could.
LAURA
We. Need. The. Piano.
PAPPY
We could rig a curtain around it.

HENRY
We’re not putting you out.

LAURA
And when Orris Stokes told you
you’d been fleeced by that man you
rented the house from, I kept my
mouth shut. But I am telling you
now, we are not getting rid of that
piano. It’s the one civilized
thing in this place. So your father
can either sleep in the lean-to or
he can sleep in the bed with you,
because I am not staying here
without my piano.
A silent showdown with Henry and Laura.

RONSEL
“Dear family. I’m writing to you
from a village in Belgium called...

...Tillet. Belgium is a country
just north of France and it’s
beautiful. Daddy you would like it
here. There are lots of farms...
The sun is high and warm. WEARY SOLDIERS and the ravages of
war are everywhere. RONSEL sits atop his tank, writing a
letter. His tank is dirty and as beat up as he is.

32.
RONSEL (V.O.)
I’ve been keeping busy, mostly
training and looking for Germans.
Luckily we haven’t seen too many.
That’s clearly a lie as Ronsel eyes a red-crossed ambulance
full of wounded soldiers driving by. He continues writing:
RONSEL (V.O.)
Of course, by the time you get
this, I’ll probably be long gone
from here. We seem to always be on
the move.
A gruff SERGEANT (Caucasian) comes marching down the line:
SERGEANT
Man all guns! Let’s move!
Ronsel pockets his pencil and letter then bangs on the hatch.
A head pops out, this is WEEKS (African American, 20’s).
C’mon.

RONSEL
CUT TO:

EXT. EUROPEAN VILLAGE - DAY
As soldiers march along, a column of tanks rolls by. Ronsel
rides, his top half up outside the hatch. A DRONING BUZZ
catches his ear and he looks up and spots a formation of B-25
bombers flying high above. Then Ronsel reacts to a Caucasian
SOLDIER who marches past:
SOLDIER
Hey, jig. Wha’ch you doing up in
that tank, boy? Be careful, might
hurt yourself!
Ronsel eyes him as he rolls on, eventually passing a sign
that points towards: MUNICH 10 km.
RONSEL (V.O.)
But when we do get a chance to set
for a spell, the locals treat us
real nice. They’re not like white
folks back home.
EXT. A MODEST GERMAN HOUSE - NIGHT
With a bouquet of flowers, a cleaned up Ronsel knocks on the
door and waits.

33.
Then a pretty German girl (RESL, 20’s) answers and smiles,
she’s been expecting him. He presents the flowers and she
hugs him. The hug turns into a kiss.
RONSEL (V.O.)
I’m mighty grateful for that. I
get homesick, and they do what they
can to make us feel right at home.
As Ronsel and Resl kiss we PRELAP the sounds of BATTLE.
INT. RONSEL’S TANK - DAY
We hear the PINGS and PANGS of bullets ricochetting off the
armor. It’s claustrophobic and hot in here as Ronsel and the
4 other African-American crew members operate like fingers on
a hand. Ronsel is the commander, CLEVE is the driver and
Weeks is the gunner.
RONSEL
Panzer, one o’clock!
WEEKS
Identified! I got him!
Fire!

RONSEL

The shell is loaded and BOOM. From Ronsel’s POV through the
view finder, we see the German tank get hit and blow up.
Woo!

RONSEL (CONT’D)
Nice shot!

Weeks smiles for a moment, then contorts his face as he RIPS
A LONG FART. The guys in the tank react.
CLEVE

RONSEL
We should load you in the gun and
fire you at the Jerries, they’d

The whole crew busts up laughing. But the laughter is cut
short by a VIOLENT BLAST. Shrapnel flies and metal twists.
Weeks absorbs the blow and gets most of his head blown off.
Ronsel gets knocked back and splattered by blood and brains.

34.
Then there is RINGING and BLURRED FOCUS as Ronsel gets his
bearings. Soon he comes to and sees a FIRE in the tank.
RONSEL (CONT’D)
Get outta the tank! Get out!
EXT. THE TANK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Machine gun fire. Ronsel, Cleve and the other two tankers
scramble out of the burning tank into a raging battle. They
slide out and hunker down against the tank for cover, pinned.
Ronsel checks and cocks his .45. As bullets thud and whiz by
Ronsel looks to the sky. He sees a lone B-25 bomber trailing
thick, black smoke as it limps home.

On Jamie, blind-flying, cold wind whistling in through the
window, snot and tears drying backwards over his face.
Desperate as he struggles with the throttle of the shuddering
bomber, Jamie is splattered in blood and some of the cockpit
windows have been shot out. Jamie looks over at his CO-PILOT
who is slumped, dead and bloody.
His eyes are drawn out the window, PARACHUTISTS escaping
another plane. Jamie rolls his plane away from the sound of
gunfire. The parachutists are shot limp, dead men floating
gently on full sails.
Jamie’s eyes brush a blood splattered picture of a pin-up
girl stuck to the co-pilot’s side of the dashboard. It’s a
pretty red-head and there are handwritten words that read:
‘LADY LUCK’. Off Jamie’s hand wrestling with the shaking
throttle...

Jamie stares at the co-pilot’s empty bunk across from him.
The bed is neatly made. There’s a black and white photo of a
woman holding an infant among other personal effects.

walls. Jamie pours himself a drink with a shaking hand, an
lonely toast to surviving. Jamie is red-eyed, fights tears

Henry speeds away, leaves Carl in the dust. Carl waves after

Carl’s smile drains as soon as Henry’s truck disappears over
the hill. He spits in the tire track.

Henry HAMMERS repairs. Outside it’s raining sheets. Then,

After we had eaten the cold suppers
she had prepared and left for us.
After we had gone to bed and tried
to stay awake to see her, when she
had been late preparing some other
woman’s children hot supper. When I
was a little girl, how I hated
those other children. The ones that
never saw my mother blue. How they
never ate the cold. I swore that my
children would have all of me.
Would see me in the daylight. But
now I know what my mother must have
known. That if something had ever
happened to that other woman’s
children, that would have been the
end of us. Now I know that she left
us not out of duty, but out of
love.

shoulders past Henry toward the sound. Abandons the couple in
their bickering.
LAURA
These children need a doctor, not
some granny with a bag of potions.
HENRY
The damn bridge is flooded -- what
do you want me to do?
Isabelle starts gagging.

Laura rushes to the girls’ room...

INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE/GIRLS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...where Florence turns Isabelle onto her side. Yellow PHLEGM
and BILE bubble from the child’s mouth, Florence wipes it
away. Laura kneels across from Florence.
FLORENCE
I seen this with my own children.
We need to get liquid down ‘em.
But first we got to clear some of
that phlegm out.
How?

LAURA

FLORENCE
Make ‘em some horehound tea. That
was real good, you making the steam
for ‘em. We’ll keep after ‘em with
it. Mist McAllan, would you kindly
please boil more water, suh?
Henry nods and moves off.
FLORENCE (CONT’D)
That tea’ll draw the phlegm right
out.

FLORENCE (CONT’D)
Once they get to breathing better,
we’ll make ‘em chicken broth and
put ground-up willow bark in it for
the fever.
LAURA
I should have taken them to the
doctor as soon as they started
coughing. If anything happens...
FLORENCE
Your girls are gonna be just fine.
God is watching over ‘em and so am
I. And neither one of us going
nowhere till they feeling better.
Laura nods her appreciation. For an instant, they are simply
two mothers tending a sick child.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
Candle and lantern light. The rain has stopped and Florence
is cutting up onions and carrots. Pappy sits in the corner,
cigarette smoke curling around him. Florence has her back to
him but she feels his eyes on her. She ignores it until:
PAPPY
I’m thirsty. Run out to the pump
and fetch me some water.
FLORENCE
I got to finish this broth for the
children.
PAPPY
That broth can do without you for a
few minutes.

Did you hear me, gal? I want some
damn water.
Laura enters from the girls’ bedroom:
LAURA
There’s drinking water in the pail
by the sink.

The girls are finally sleeping.
After you finish the broth you
should go on home, Florence.

FLORENCE
Yes’m, but like I told your
husband, that whooping cough is
catching. If I went home I could
pass it to my own children.
LAURA
We’ll make room for you here.
PAPPY

LAURA
They’re asleep. And now your
father is proposing we send
Florence home.
HENRY
She’ll infect her own family.
PAPPY
Then she can sleep out in the barn.
LAURA
How could you suggest such a thing
in this cold?

Florence flicks a look to Pappy, reeling at the prospect of
dealing with him every day.
LAURA (CONT’D)

your family.

Laura smiles, waiting for Florence to leap at the
opportunity. Off Florence, not leaping...

HAP
We don’t belong to them. We pay

That’s it. They can’t just pick us

Laying on his side, he foams at the mouth, limbs paralyzed.
Hap drops his head, looks up at Florence. PRELAP the sound of
a GUNSHOT...
INT. HAP’S CHURCH - DAY
Hap is a bullet across the pulpit. He transmutes despair into
belief behind his own eyes. He rallies, forces himself to
clap and sing. The church falls in with him. Florence tries
to sing along but looks exhausted behind her eyes.

EXT. HAP’S CHURCH - DAY
Hap still in his Sunday clothes high up on a ladder. He
hammers a mismatched length of siding into place. Another
DEACON patches shingles on the roof. Hap stops, takes in the
sunset behind him. Marlon sprinting back up the road with
building supplies. Hap puffs at the sight of his son.
HAP (V.O.)
Pride goeth before a fall. But I
was just looking at God’s own
creation. Is that pride? Is that a
sin? Why?
Hap’s hammer slips from his grip, he clutches after it, the
ladder tumbles sideways. Hap falling in slow motion.
HAP (V.O.)
I can’t answer my children when
they ask me.
Hap now paralyzed on the ground, stiff and sputtering like
the mule. Marlon and other Deacons gathering around him.
Hap’s eyes wide in surprise. Hap blacks out.

broken skin. Hap doesn’t cry out. His leg is discolored and
misshapen. Florence wraps clean bandages around it
-- Hap pushes open his bedroom window, sees FLORENCE and
MARLON working the field on their own. Florence coaches the
boy along, they work well past dark, invisible except for
their bobbing lanterns and the percussion of seed bags
bouncing against their legs
-- Lilly May changes Hap's bedpan, Hap holds himself up one
trembling elbow, keeps his face craned toward the wall. Shame
pools in the corner of his eyes
EXT. COTTON FIELD - DAY
Florence and Marlon’s hard labor apparent in symmetrical rows

Nothing we could do set there and

INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAWN
Hap watches his family out the window as they hoist their
hoes and water buckets out to the mud-slicked mess to begin
again. Lilly Mae in an oversized hat has joined them this
time and jogs to keep up. Four lanterns bobbing against cold
daybreak.
HAP (V.O.)
Lingered along, lingered along.
Laid in that bed knowing my wife
was out doing my work for me.
Florence’s hands all blistered up

The blare of Henry’s tractor engine. Hap throws off the bed
covers. Drenched in sweat, he snatches down a pair of
workpants. He lifts his bad leg into the trouser hole and
shimmies his pants over his waist. He shifts his weight onto
his good leg and levers himself upright on one leg. He takes
a fortifying breath, slowly eases his bad foot to the ground-AGH!!!!

I hadn’t always enjoyed Henry’s
lovemaking, but it made me feel

Henry blows out the candle. Gives her his back. Laura
caresses Henry’s back. He ignores her.
LAURA (V.O.)
I never thought of refusing him.
How could he refuse me? No it
wasn’t fulfilling. But it was at
least a kind of sweet intimacy.

Sunlight fills the room where Ronsel and Resl sleep
peacefully entwined. We notice a delicate gold necklace with
a crucifix hanging from Resl’s neck. A few quiet beats, then
a cacophony of HORN HONKS and JEEP ENGINES crescendos.
Ronsel wakes quickly but Resl snoozes on. Then, outside, he
hears HOOTS and HOLLERS.
Ronsel extracts himself from Resl’s sleepy embrace and moves
to the window. There he sees a procession of American
soldiers hanging off jeeps and trucks, waving American flags.

Hello. Miss-VERA
Vera. You can call me Vera.
LAURA
Hello Vera.
VERA
This here is my youngest, Alma.
Vera’s skinny daughter ALMA, recessive of chin and dull of

We needa talk to you.

Vera crossing her dirty bare feet on Laura’s rug. Laura tries
not to notice. Her daughter Alma in the window picking at the
ends of her hair.
VERA
You cain’t put us off.
Excuse me?

LAURA

VERA
We ain’t got nowhere to go if you
put us off. Nobody’ll hire us this
late in the season.
LAURA
It’s not up to me Vera, it’s up to
my husband.
Vera rubs her pregnant belly.
VERA
I’m asking you to keep us on.
LAURA
I’m telling you, it’s not my
decision.
VERA
And if it was?
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
Laura hums as she churns butter on the porch while Henry
reads the paper and Pappy smokes. Laura’s churning is
especially tense and Henry notices:

Alright then, what is it?

LAURA
Vera Atwood is eight and a half
months pregnant. Where would they
go? How would they survive?
PAPPY
Ain’t this touching? Saint Laura,
protector of women and children.
HENRY
Atwood is a lazy, stupid drunk.
He’s lucky I’ve kept him this long.
LAURA
Then make him work on half shares
like Hap and his family.
HENRY
Why would I go through all that
when I can just hire a new tenant?
LAURA
Because you are a Christian.
PAPPY
The Lord ain’t the one putting food
on our table.
LAURA
Didn’t you tell me most farmers
around here can’t find enough help
to make a crop?
(beat)
Call it a business decision. For
the good of the farm.
Laura has a point.
HENRY
I’ll have a word with Carl tomorrow
morning. Just a word.
Laura rewards him with the tiniest smile, softens her
churning. Henry basks in her quiet favor.
PAPPY
Next she’ll be telling you what to
plant.

EXT. MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - MORNING
Laura’s hands red, raw, and forgotten between her knees. A
washboard leans in a still steaming bucket of gray water.
Laura stares at a dead mouse curled on the bottom step.
LAURA (V.O.)
Violence is part and parcel of
country life. You’re forever being
assailed by dead things.
Amanda Leigh accidentally bumps a pair of trousers off the
clothesline. Amanda Leigh jumps back from the muddy heap,
braces for her mother’s censure. Laura just blinks. Amanda
Leigh slings the pants back onto the line and scurries away.
LAURA (V.O.)
Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead
possums, dead birds.
EXT. MCALLAN FARM - BARN - DAY
A POSSUM CORPSE languishes beneath a tree. Ants march in and
out of its pink mouth.
LAURA (V.O.)
You find them in the yard. You
smell them rotting under the house.
EXT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAY
A sharp flick of the wrist, Florence SNAPS a chicken’s neck.
The body flops and unspirals itself as she runs a boning
knife across the jugular, spills hot blood onto the dirt.
LAURA (V.O.)
And then there are the creatures
you kill for food.
EXT. THE ATWOOD CABIN - DAY
Dirty CHILDREN straddle and climb the rickety porch railing.
Vera Atwood nudges tight brown fur backward over limp
squirrel haunches.
LAURA (V.O.)
Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs,
squirrels. Pluck, skin, disembowel,
debone, fry.
Vera wipes her nose on her shoulder, wedges the too-dull
pocketknife deeper under the skin.

INT. THE MCALLAN FARM - NIGHT
LAURA (V.O.)
Eat. Start again. Kill.
Laura runs a pipe cleaner down the barrel of a HUNTING RIFLE.
LAURA (V.O.)
I learned how to stitch up a
bleeding wound, load and fire a
shotgun, reach into the womb of
heaving sow to deliver a breech
piglet. My hands did these things.
Laura snaps the barrel into place.
LAURA (V.O.)
But I was never easy in my mind.
INT./EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - DAY
Laura gnawing at the balls of her hands. Thick yellow
callouses peel off between her teeth. She chews them
thoughtfully. Stares out the window entranced.
AMANDA LEIGH
Momma, somebody’s coming!
A handsome soldier in aviator sunglasses carrying a suitcase.
Laura looks and realizes:
AMANDA LEIGH (CONT’D)
Uncle Jamie!!
Laura shoots to her feet, smooths her hands against her
apron.
Jamie?!

HENRY (O.S.)

Henry whoops and bolts off the porch, limp and all. Laura
hangs back in the doorway. She straightens her dress and
runs her fingers through her hair. She sights her dirty
fingernails, clasps her hands behind her back.
Henry rocks Jamie in a tight embrace.

JAMIE
You look good, brother.

JAMIE
Don’t sugarcoat it now.
Laura edges closer with Amanda Leigh and Isabelle, she holds
out her hands for a squeeze. Jamie smiles, scoops her into a
hug instead.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Laura. Sweet sister-in-law.
LAURA
Welcome home, Jamie.
JAMIE
How are you liking it here in
Henry’s version of paradise?
Laura starts to answer but is spared from having to lie by:
PAPPY
You’d think a son would see fit to
greet his own father.
JAMIE
Dearest Pappy. I’d forgotten how
much I missed you.
Said with a cut of sarcasm as Jamie shakes Pappy’s hand.
HENRY
(to Jamie re: Pappy)
He’s missed you too. He won’t
admit it but he has.
JAMIE
I bet. And he probably quit
smoking and joined the NAACP too.
Laura laughs and Jamie winks at her. Pappy doesn’t appreciate
the joke. Then Jamie smiles at Amanda Leigh and Isabelle.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Well hello little ones. Give your
uncle Jamie a hug.
The girls run and jump into his arms.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
The jitter of Jamie’s hand as he cradles a lit cigarette. He
pours a drink and finishes in a single draught. Pappy takes
note, doesn’t hide his disdain. Henry pretends not to see.

68.
PAPPY
So what’s it like being a big hero?
JAMIE
I wouldn’t know.
PAPPY
Don’t give me that. Army wrote me
about your fancy medals. Said they
was the highest honors an airman
could receive.
JAMIE
I was lucky. Lotta guys weren’t.
PAPPY
Bet you got plenty of tail out of
it too.
HENRY
Jamie’s never needed medals to get
girls.
PAPPY
Damn right. Takes after me that
way. Your momma was the prettiest
girl in Greenville. And I had ‘em
all sniffing after me.
Pappy smiles with his yellow teeth. Jamie shifts in his
chair and lights one cigarette with another.
PAPPY (CONT’D)
One thing’s for sure. You must’a
killed a whole lotta Krauts to get
all them medals.
(beat)
Well, how many’d you take out?
JAMIE
I don’t know.
PAPPY
Take a guess.
JAMIE
I don’t know. Why’s it matter?
PAPPY
A man ought to know how many men
he’s killed.

69.
Henry returns with the bottle and a glass. Jamie quickly
uncorks it and pours heavily. He gulps it down and refills.
Henry is surprised.
JAMIE
I can tell you this.
(beat)
It was more than one.
HENRY
(under his breath)
Aw, shit.
Pappy’s eyes narrow and he seethes for a beat, then smirks:
PAPPY
Well, at least I looked my one in
the eye before I shot him. Not
like dropping bombs from a mile up
in the air.
Jamie throws back his drink and pours another.
uncomfortable silence until Henry interrupts:

Then there is

HENRY
Well, good time to hit the hay.
Got an early day tomorrow.
JAMIE
I’ll just finish my drink.
Pappy absorbs this, grabs a lantern and shuffles out. Jamie
slugs back his whiskey. His eyes flick back to the bottle.
Henry grabs it and moves it out of range.
HENRY
What you need is a good night’s
sleep. Laura made a bed up for you.
Jamie stands and Henry gives him a hug.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Welcome home, little brother.
(beat)
Now, go on, get some sleep.
Henry starts to move off.
JAMIE
Actually it was more like four.
What?

HENRY

70.
JAMIE
Miles up in the air. The altitude
we dropped bombs from.
HENRY
How can you even see anything from
that high up?
JAMIE
You’d be surprised. Roads, cities,
factories. Just not people. From
twenty thousand feet they’re not
even ants.
(beat)
Pappy’s right. A man ought to
know.
Jamie is haunted.

Henry is concerned.

INT. TRICKLEBANK’S GENERAL STORE - DAY
Rose Tricklebank takes her time bagging groceries for Jamie.
Jamie is polite, but curt as his eyes are on his freshly
purchased bottle of bourbon.
TRICKLEBANK
How long you been back from
overseas now?
JAMIE
Coupl’a weeks.
TRICKLEBANK
And how’re you liking Marietta?
JAMIE
Lovely little town.

Just lovely.

Tricklebank moves to bag the bourbon, but Jamie intervenes.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
Oh, I got that one. Let’s just put
that right here.
Jamie puts the bottle in a convenient spot, hurriedly shoves
in the remaining provisions.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
There we go. Much obliged, Miz
Tricklebank. You have yourself a
wonderful day.
Jamie smiles, grabs his stuff and heads out.

71.
TRICKLEBANK
Take care, now. Come back soon.
EXT. TRICKLEBANK’S GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Jamie hustles past a handful of WHITE TOWNSMEN on the porch
of the store. Among them is Orris Stokes. A passing car
BACKFIRES. Jamie hits the ground and covers his head.
Groceries spill everywhere. The townsmen murmur and stare.
RONSEL (O.S.)
It’s alright. It was just a car.
A helping hand extended, Jamie follows it up to Ronsel.
RONSEL (CONT’D)
Backfired. Must have a stuck
intake valve.
Jamie looks up at the porch and sees mean eyes staring from
underneath hat brims. He ignores Ronsel’s hand, gets up and
retrieves his groceries. Ronsel helps. But when Jamie grabs
the bourbon his hand shakes so badly he drops it. Thankfully
it doesn’t break.
Dammit.

JAMIE

RONSEL
They say it stops eventually.
Ronsel holds out his own hand and it shakes like Jamie’s.
They trade a look and despite being from different worlds,
there’s an instant kinship.
JAMIE
You’re Ronsel, Hap’s boy.
(off Ronsel’s nod)
Jamie McAllan. Henry’s brother.
Jamie offers a hand shake. Ronsel is surprised by the show
of respect, but he obliges.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
You walk here?
Yessir.

RONSEL

JAMIE
I’ll give you a lift.
(off Ronsel’s reluctance)
C’mon.

72.

Thank you.

RONSEL

Jamie and Ronsel move to the truck where Ronsel hops in the
truck bed and Jamie hops in the driver’s side. Both of them
are aware of the men still watching from the porch.
INT. HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY
Jamie steals looks at Ronsel through the back window, squirms
with guilt. Memories of the B25 echo in his ears. Ronsel
oblivious to it, chasing his daydreams flitting across the
landscape. Jamie pulls over.
JAMIE
Come on up front.
RONSEL
I’m doing just fine back here.
JAMIE
Get in soldier! That’s an order!
A beat, then the truck rocks as Ronsel hops off and gets in
the passenger side.
RONSEL
How do you know you outranked me?
JAMIE
I was a captain.
RONSEL
We had Negro captains.

Fighting”! Spearheaded for Patton.
You?
JAMIE
I flew B-25’s.
Jamie reaches into the grocery bag between them and takes out
the bourbon bottle. He uncorks it then takes a long, much
needed swig and drives on.

73.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
So, sergeant, how do you like being
back here in the Delta?
Ronsel doesn’t answer, he just looks away.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Yeah, me too.
(beat)
Heard you and my Pappy had words.
RONSEL
(stiffening)
I apologized for that.
Then to Ronsel’s surprise, Jamie toasts with the bottle.
JAMIE
He’s a disagreeable sonovabitch.
I’m sure he had it coming.
(offering the bourbon)
Here’s to you.
No thanks.

RONSEL

JAMIE
You always this stubborn? Or is it
just around white people trying to
be nice?
Ronsel eyes Jamie, then he grabs the bottle, takes a quick
sip and tries to hand it back.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
What kind of NCO are you?
Then Ronsel takes a big swig. So big it makes him choke and
spill a little. Jamie laughs:
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Don’t waste it now. That’s my
medicine. I need every drop.
Ronsel admits a slight grin as he recovers and hands the
bottle back. Jamie takes a pull, then:
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Hey, you tanker boys ever piss in
your helmets?
RONSEL
Plenty of times.

74.
JAMIE
We had relief tubes up in the
cockpit but sometimes it was easier
just to use our flak helmets. And
at twenty thousand feet? That piss
freezes solid in less than minute.
RONSEL
It’s that cold up there?
JAMIE
I’m talking twenty, thirty below
zero. And one time we were on this
long haul and I went in my helmet
and forgot all about it. Then when
we got close to the target, I put
the helmet back on. And we’re
doing our bombing run, dodging
enemy flak and suddenly I feel
something running down my face.
They both laugh as Jamie passes the bottle back to Ronsel.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
I smelled like a damn latrine.
RONSEL
You must’a caught hell back at the
officer’s club.
JAMIE
My buddies never let me hear the
end of it.

The ones that made it back anyway.
Yeah.

RONSEL
Lost some friends myself.

They drive on in silence.

EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM OUTHOUSE- DAY
Laura sloshes through ankle deep mud, trudges to the leaning
outhouse.
Laura opens the door to the BUZZING of flies. It’s a hot day
and the smell in here is oppressive. Breathing though her
mouth, she lifts her skirt, squats and pees. She looks down
at the mud caked onto her boots and the hem of her dress.
SERIES OF SHOTS: LAURA’S TORTUOUS BATHING RITUAL
LAURA (V.O.)
Saturday was my favorite day of the

to the stove
LAURA (V.O.)
It was the only day I felt truly
clean.
--LAURA hauling steaming water to a ZINC TUB in the yard, she
bathes her muddy DAUGHTERS. The water turns brown.

--The girls clean-washed and napping on the porch. LAURA
lowers herself into their cloudy lukewarm leftovers. Laura
cups water over herself, squats in the fleeting privacy of a
flapping sheet. PAPPY happens by, averts his eyes a little
too slowly.
LAURA (V.O.)
The rest of the time, we stank.

as he drags into the yard covered in mud.

bouquets of lavender everywhere - in cans on the floor, in
bunches nailed to the wall and hanging from the ceiling.
Laura chuckles and smiles wide then takes a whiff. Not bad,
it’s working. Then she lifts her skirt, squats and pees.

Jamie and Ronsel stumble from the truck to the dilapidated
saw mill.
Ronsel hesitates.
JAMIE
C’mon, now, we’re clear of town,
nobody’s out here.
(with a bourbon bottle)
Don’t make me drink alone. I will
if I have to.
Ronsel prys at a loose board.
RONSEL
Hope this damn thing don’t fall
down on us.

INT. SAW MILL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jamie and Ronsel shimmy in through a ragged gap. It’s old,
decrepit and laden with cobwebs. Shafts of sunlight jut in
through the wooden slats.
RONSEL
Used to come here when I was a boy.
Whenever I needed to be alone and
think.
JAMIE
Well I love what you’ve done with
the place.
Jamie offers Ronsel a smoke. Ronsel accepts and Jamie lights
his own then tosses Ronsel the lighter. Ronsel lights up and
tosses the lighter back.
RONSEL
Why you treating me so nice?
JAMIE
Because you look like you could use
it.
Bullshit.

RONSEL

Jamie drags on his smoke and measures Ronsel with a drunken
eye. Then:
JAMIE
We were somewhere over Austria and
we made contact with a swarm of
Messerschmitts. They were
everywhere.
HARD CUT TO:
INT. B-25 BOMBER COCKPIT (MOVING) - DAY
It’s bumpy as Jamie holds the plane on course. Suddenly
bullets rip through the cockpit and the co-pilot gets
shredded. Blood splatters on Jamie and on the “LADY LUCK”
pin-up girl. Jamie is horrified and we hear his VOICE OVER:

gunner...my co-pilot. Made a deal
with God right there.

goddamn cavalry. They knocked
those Germans right outta the sky.
I swear they were angels sent by
the Lord himself.
HARD CUT TO:
INT. B-25 BOMBER COCKPIT (MOVING) - DAY
Jamie holds the plane on it’s shaky course. Then he looks
out to his left and sees a U.S. fighter plane come close.
JAMIE (V.O.)
Those P-38’s, their tails were
painted red. And one of ‘em, he
buzzed me after the fight. When I
looked over I thought I was seeing
things. But that fighter pilot?
He was colored.
The fighter pilot looks at Jamie and salutes. Jamie returns
the favor. Then the fighter plane rolls and peels off.
BACK TO:

JAMIE
Then he saluted me. And I saluted
back.

Vera buries her face in her hands, lets out a feral howl.
Laura hesitates, reaches for her. Vera steps backward out of

Surprise! Thought you might like a
little privacy every now and then.
Well, what do you think?
Laura stares at it, truly touched by the gesture.
LAURA
I think it’s marvelous.

Thank you.

Laura hugs Jamie. It feels good and she sinks into him.
there’s a pin prick of light in the dark tunnel of her
depression.

And

HENRY
What’s this?
Jamie and Laura quickly break the hug when Henry walks up.
LAURA
Your brother built us a shower.
HENRY
You don’t say.
Henry checks out the handy work and Laura and Jamie trade a
quick glance.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM - SHOWER - SUNSET
Laura enters with a towel. The deep thrum of insects and
frogs mingles with the distant sound of Amanda Leigh
practicing scales on the piano in the house.
As Laura gets undressed she looks up and notices large clouds
stained with hues of pink and gold from the setting sun.
She pulls the rope and the bucket tilts and pours water into
another bucket punctured with holes which creates a shower
effect. Then she releases the rope and stops the water flow.
Jamie was thoughtful enough to put in a soap dish. In it is
a purple bar of soap. Laura puts the soap to her nose and
draws in the scent. Lavender. She smiles and lathers up.

Then she pulls the rope all the way and the entire bucket
starts pouring. The water is warm and it feels wonderful.
It’s been so long since she had a shower. She rinses and it
feels so good it’s almost sensual.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM - DAY
Henry drives his tractor through thick mud. The crops have
grown-in but the field is flooded and in bad shape. Then the
tractor lurches and gets stuck. Henry puts it in reverse and
the tires just spin and dig deeper. Henry puts it in drive
and tries the other direction. To no avail.
Dammit.

HENRY

EXT. COTTON FIELD - DAY
Still on one crutch, Hap works the wet, overgrown field. The
mud makes the hard work even harder. He loses his footing
and falls. He gets up, more covered in mud than he was
before.
EXT. JACKSON CABIN - DAY
Lilly May and Marlon perched on barbed wire fence posts
gunning down imaginary enemies. Lilly May wears Ronsel’s
helmet, Marlon wears Ronsel’s boots.
LILLY MAY
BANG BANG! You dead Nazi cracka,
you dead!
Marlon oversteers his “tank”.
MARLON
GRRRRRR! Domp, domp domp domp. We
runnin’ ‘em over! Watch your right
gunner!
Lilly May swivels her imaginary gun over to the right. Just
then a truck full of WHITE SHARECROPPERS rolls by. Lilly May
lowers her “gun”. A man tosses a soda bottle in their yard.
The truck rattles past.
LILLY MAY
(whispers)
Bang. You dead.
INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAY
Florence mends socks as she looks through a window watching
Ronsel sit against a tree smoking a cigarette. He’s got a
thousand yard stare as he mindlessly drags and exhales.

86.
Henry’s truck pulls up, Jamie behind the wheel. Ronsel hops
into the passenger side. Florence doesn’t like what she
sees. Then the truck pulls out and Florence watches it go.
EXT. JACKSON CABIN - DUSK
Florence leaning against the porch post, gazing into the
distance. Hap hobbles out on his still-splinted leg. He leans
his crutches against the house, puts his arms around her,
inhales her neck. Florence cradles his head.
HAP
You ain’t tired?
FLORENCE
We gotta let him go.
HAP
We’re not holding him.
FLORENCE
We are. He’s staying for us.
HAP
Maybe he wants to stay. It’s not
always gonna be like this. Soon as
I’m healed we’ll move outta here.
We’ll be okay. He’ll be okay once
he has his own place-Florence drops her head. Hap spins her around to him, pulls
her into a clumsy one-legged two step. Hap hums some broken
tune. Florence melts onto him.
HAP (CONT’D)
Remember that?
FLORENCE
You not supposed to be up on this
broke leg, Hawthorne Jackson. You
never let it heal, you never gon’
walk.
HAP
Why walk if I can’t dance?
Hap and Florence swaying, hanging in each other’s eyes,
grasping for exhausted joy.
INT. SAW MILL - DAY
Jamie lights a cigarette and Ronsel sips from the bottle.
They’re both drunk. It’s hot in here and the sunlit smoke
hangs on the humid air.

87.
RONSEL
The silver star? Damn.
JAMIE
Don’t be impressed.
being stupid.
What?

I got it for

RONSEL

JAMIE
I almost drowned in a flood when I
was a kid. Since then, baths,
swimming pools, any kind of water I
hate it. And this one mission I
changed course so we wouldn’t be
over the water so long. And, as
luck would have it, we ran smack
dab into some enemy flak. A lot of
it. But I managed to hit the
target and bring us all back.
RONSEL
You so scared of water you’d rather
get shot at than fly over it?
JAMIE
Damnedest thing, ain’t it?
They share a laugh and a drink, then:
JAMIE (CONT’D)
You ever miss it sometimes? Being
over there? I don’t mean getting
shot at, but... I actually miss it.
RONSEL
Me too. Over there I was a
Liberator. Had folks lined up on
the street cheering and throwing
flowers. Back here, I’m just
another nigger pushing a plow.
JAMIE
Miss some of the guys too.
RONSEL
Think about ‘em every day.
JAMIE
Seeing different parts of the
world.
(smiling)
(MORE)

88.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
Italian girls. English girls.
Ronsel leaks a smile.
RONSEL
It was different over there.
JAMIE
(beat)
You ever been with a white girl?
A few.

RONSEL

JAMIE
Well I’ll be damned.
RONSEL
Army gave us separate barracks,
separate blood supply, separate
latrines. But them European girls
didn’t mind us a bit.
(then)
When we were in Wimbourne, English
gal I never laid eyes on patted me
right on the butt. Told me she was
checking for a tail because the
white GI’s was saying we were more
monkey than human. So we made sure
to show ‘em just how human we were
every opportunity we got.
JAMIE
German girls too, huh?
Yeah.

RONSEL
Well...one in particular.

Ronsel drifts with the memory of Resl, wistful.
JAMIE
Uh oh, I’ve seen that look before.
She must’a been something special.
RONSEL
Yeah. She was. But that was then.
And this is now. I’m back home.
Right where I belong.
Said with a cut of drunken sarcasm.

89.
INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - NIGHT
Crickets outside as Ronsel lays in bed by candlelight, wide
awake. He’s gazing at Resl’s gold necklace and crucifix.
Then, with resolve, he stuffs it into a small tin box next to
his bed and closes the lid shut. Then he blows out the
candle, still wide awake as he tries to forget her.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM - HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Henry snores loudly. So loudly Laura is awake. She shakes
him and he stops. Then Laura settles in and tries to get
comfortable. But after a few moments, Henry starts snoring
again. Finally, Laura succumbs to the futility and gets up.
EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
Laura exits the house into the moonlight. She is startled
when she nearly trips over Jamie, who is passed out with an
empty bottle of bourbon. Fully clothed and breathing heavily
from drink, he is peaceful and pitiful all at once.
JAMIE
Nonono, I can’t swim! I can’t swim!
Laura turns and sees Jamie writhing in his sleep:
NO!

JAMIE (CONT’D)
AHHHH! AHHHHH!!!!

Jamie!

LAURA
Jamie wake up!

Laura shakes him hard. Jamie shoots to upright, eyes
darting. Then he looks to Laura as the sense creeps back
into him. A beat, then he starts crying. She pulls him to
her and he sinks into her arms.
After a few moments, Henry appears in the doorway. Neither
Laura nor Jamie notice him. Henry says nothing. He just
stands there watching their embrace, jealousy in his eyes.
Eventually, Henry moves back into the house.
Then Jamie rips himself away from Laura’s embrace:
JAMIE (CONT’D)
I gotta get outta here.
Jamie...

LAURA

Jamie stumbles toward Henry’s car, gets in and pulls away.
CUT TO:

90.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
As Henry’s car goes blazing by, swerving.
INT. HENRY’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER
Jamie dozing at the wheel. He awakes and jerks the truck
toward the side of the road. Overshoots, and slips into a
ditch. Jamie squinting, flailing, cursing as he strips the
gears trying to free the truck.
DAMN!!

JAMIE

Jamie shuts off the engine, slumps across the wheel crying,
blubbering, incoherent. He falls asleep across the wheel.
Headlights still on.
OMITTED
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING
Sheriff Thacker knocking on the truck window. Jamie, redeyed, stubbled, haggard shoulders a line of drool away. He
wakes slowly, drags his sodden gaze to the window. Henry
frowns over the Sheriff’s shoulder. Jamie shudders, struggles
with the car door. Sheriff helps rip it open. Jamie stumbles
into the light.
SHERIFF THACKER
We’ll get it hauled out in the
morning, Henry.
Jamie and Henry clamber out of the ditch in silence.
is hungover and haggard.
I’m sorry.

Jamie

JAMIE

Henry shakes his head in disgust.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM - BARN - DAY
Henry hammers repairs while Jamie finishes milking the cow.
When Jamie stands he trips, falls and spills milk everywhere.
Jamie laughs.
HENRY
You think it’s funny spilling good
milk?

91.
JAMIE
(slurring)
Well you know what they say, no use
crying over it.
HENRY
No, especially when it’s somebody
else’s.
Jamie stops grinning and turns sarcastic as he reaches into
his pocket and produces some coins and crumpled bills.
JAMIE
I see. What do I owe you, Henry?
About a dollar and a half? Let’s
just say two to be safe.
Jamie pushes the money at him. Henry slaps his hand away and
the money goes flying. A clumsy, half-hearted fist-fight.
HENRY
For Christ’s sake, this ain’t about
the money.
JAMIE
Then what do you want from me?
HENRY
For you to be a man!
JAMIE
One pail of spilled milk and I’m
not a man?
HENRY
You’re sure not acting like one.
Disappear for days at a time doing
whatever you damn well please. And
when you are here, you’re drunk.
JAMIE
I don’t answer to you.
HENRY
You do when you live in my house
and work on my farm.
JAMIE
Oh, well I’m real sorry about that
Mr. Boss man. But don’t take it
out on me because your little
farmer dream ain’t working. Ain’t
my fault your crops are getting
flooded out.

92.
HENRY
Well you sure as hell ain’t helping
matters. It’s like having another
goddamn child to look after.
JAMIE
You need to open your eyes, big
brother. You’re so busy walking
around here like God almighty, so
wrapped up in yourself and your
damn farm you can’t even see your
own wife is miserable.
HENRY
Watch your mouth.
Or what?

JAMIE

Henry clenches his fists and squares up. Jamie stands his
ground. But Henry restrains himself.
HENRY
Know what? You be whatever kind of
man you want. Just go do it
someplace else.
JAMIE
Fine, I’ll go to town.
HENRY
I don’t mean just for the night. In
the morning I’m going to Greenville
for a few days to see about some
livestock. I’ll expect you gone
when I get back.
They hold a look, neither man seeing clearly through the fog
of anger and pride. Then Henry leaves Jamie in his wake.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BARN - LATER
As Jamie packs his things, frustrated, angry.
Laura knocks at his open doorway.
LAURA
Hi there, will you be here for
supper tonight?
Uh...no.

JAMIE

He reacts when

93.
LAURA
(re: the packed bags)
Are you going someplace?
JAMIE
Out west probably. Gotta buddy
from the war who lives in Los
Angeles.
LAURA
Los Angeles? Jamie, what are you
talking about?
JAMIE
He didn’t tell you?
LAURA
Who didn’t tell me what?
Henry.
What?

JAMIE
He kicked me out.
LAURA

JAMIE
He asked me to leave.
had it coming.

I probably

LAURA
That can’t be. He’s just sore
about the wreck. Let me talk to
him.
JAMIE
No, Laura. He’s more than just
sore. And it’s probably for the
best.
LAURA
So just like that? You up and
leave? Were you even planning on
saying good-bye?
JAMIE
Of course. First bus out doesn’t
leave ‘til two.
LAURA
What about the girls? This will
break their little hearts.
JAMIE
I’ll talk to them.

94.
Jamie keeps packing. The suddenness of this new reality is a
bitter prospect for Laura.
LAURA
Does your father know?
JAMIE
I’ll go down to the river and find
the girls. And Pappy... I’ll just
leave him a note.
LAURA
You don’t need to go, Jamie. When
Henry cools off he’ll listen to me.
Jamie stops packing for a moment and stares at the floor.
Then he looks at her, so much hurt in his eyes.
JAMIE
Laura, I can’t stay here. I feel
like I’m suffocating. I can’t
explain it...
LAURA
You don’t need to.
Laura runs her hand along his suitcase and wishes she could
run away with him. Jamie tamps his pain, tired of being
pathetic. Laura moves to him, close. They gaze at each
other for a very long beat, neither wanting to say goodbye.
Then with alarming swiftness, Laura grabs Jamie and kisses
him. Deeply. Hungrily. Then suddenly he pushes her away.
Both of them breathe heavily, their hearts racing. Then
Jamie pulls her close and they kiss again. Clothes get torn
off as they tumble onto the bed. Jamie and Laura devour each
other.
INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAY
Florence, Hap, Marlon and Lilly May clean up after breakfast.
Ronsel enters, haggard and sleepless.
HAP
It’s half past nine. You just now
getting up?
Ronsel shrugs and nods.
HAP (CONT’D)
You just gon’ lay around all day?
While your brothers and sisters
work? What’s wrong with you--

95.
LILLY MAY
You got a letter. Says it’s all
the way from Germany.
What?

RONSEL

Hap hands over a worn envelope that’s traveled a long way.
Ronsel snatches it.
HAP
Who’s Resl Braun?
RONSEL
Someone I knew.
And Ronsel heads out the front door.
HAP
Where you going now?

Ronsel!

RONSEL
I’ll be back.
EXT. MISSISSIPPI ROAD - DAY
The grey horizon hints at a coming storm. Ronsel walks
along, a swirl of emotion, shaking his head in disbelief as
he reads the letter.
Then he reacts to the rising sound of an APPROACHING TRUCK.
He quickly shoves the letter into his pockets. The truck is
moving fast. The glint from the windshield prevents us from
seeing the driver. But we hear the engine rev higher as he
steps on the gas.
Ronsel moves to the shoulder of the road. But the truck
swerves in his direction and bears down on him. Ronsel runs
and dives into a ditch just as the truck rumbles up and skids
to a fast stop. Then, surprisingly, Jamie tumbles out,
laughing and drunk. He’s got a bottle of whiskey and he
looks like absolute hell.
JAMIE
You should’a seen the look on your
face.
RONSEL
It ain’t funny.
JAMIE
Actually, my friend, it was indeed.

96.
Ronsel gets up and brushes himself off. Jamie is still
smiling. Then soon, Ronsel can’t help but smile too.
RONSEL
You’re crazy you know that, right?
JAMIE
Can’t argue with that. No, sir.
Jamie takes a pull from the bottle and plops to the ground, a
mess. Ronsel sees the state he’s in.
Hey.

RONSEL
Is something the matter?

Jamie gets quiet and picks at the label on the bottle.
JAMIE
What’s the worst thing you ever
did?
RONSEL
(after a beat)
That lady I told you about.
one at the prison camp.

The

JAMIE
No, I mean something that hurt
somebody real bad. And you knew it
was gonna hurt ‘em, but you did it
anyway.
This time Ronsel gets quiet for a long beat. Then he pulls
out the letter and a photo and hands it to Jamie.
RONSEL
Leaving her.
Jamie looks at the picture then reads the letter.
reacts and smiles:
JAMIE
Well, I’ll be. Congratulations.
You’re a father.
RONSEL
His name’s Franz.
JAMIE
Franz. That’s a good name.
(then)
So that’s the German girl.

Then he

97.
Ronsel nods and we finally see the photo. It is of Resl
holding a swaddled baby. Jamie hands the photo back to
Ronsel and holds up the bottle:
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Well this calls for a celebration.
Here’s to Franz.
Jamie takes a swig and hands Ronsel the bottle.
To Franz.

RONSEL

Then Ronsel takes a drink and gives the bottle back to Jamie.
JAMIE
So what the hell are you gonna do?
RONSEL
I have no idea. She wants me to go
to Germany.
JAMIE
Long way off.
Ronsel nods, he knows. Jamie stares into the distance as
Ronsel stares at Franz. Then:
RONSEL
What about you? What’s the worst
thing you ever done?
Jamie looks at him, his mind on Laura and their tryst.
Jamie smiles and covers:
Who me?

But

JAMIE
I’m a saint.

RONSEL
Oh yeah, I bet.
Then there’s a distant THUNDER RUMBLE. The clouds on the
horizon are getting darker. Jamie kills the whiskey bottle
and tosses it into the ditch.
INT. HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
Jamie and Ronsel pass a new bottle and sing in unison:
JAMIE/RONSEL
It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t
got that swing.
(MORE)

98.
JAMIE/RONSEL (CONT'D)
Doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, dooah, doo-ah, doo-ah. It don’t mean
a thing all you got -They both react to an approaching car and stop singing.
JAMIE
Oh shit, put your head down.
Ronsel ducks. The dust makes it hard to see but the road is
narrow and soon they pass the oncoming car. Orris drives and
Pappy rides shotgun. Jamie looks forward and Ronsel keeps
his head low. Pappy and Orris crane their necks as the
vehicles cross.
RONSEL
You think they saw us?
JAMIE
Don’t know.
INT. HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
Jamie and Ronsel pull up to the Jackson’s shack, both drunk.
JAMIE
Here we are.
(beat)
I’ll be leaving town soon and...
Well, good luck to you. You’ve been
a friend. I want you to know that.
RONSEL
Yeah? Well I want you to know it
too. You’re one of the good ones.
Jamie hesitates to accept this truth. Ronsel extends a hand.
Jamie graps it, they shake hard.
JAMIE
Hope you find a way to your...to
your boy...to your... family.
RONSEL
Take care of yourself.
You too.

JAMIE

They hold a look, friends. Jamie extends a hand. They shake.

INT. THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAY
The RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER.
enters, wobbly and high.
Hi, Momma.

Florence flinches when Ronsel

RONSEL

She watches him, wants to hug him ask him where he’s been.
But what comes out is:
FLORENCE
You hungry?
No.

RONSEL
Where is everybody?

FLORENCE
Went up to church. Late service.
Ronsel plops onto his cot. Florence wants to talk to him,
help him, but he seems so unreachable.
Ronsel reaches into his pocket and pulls out the envelope
from Resl. He reaches inside and finds nothing. Where’s the
letter and the photo? Brow furrowed, he stands and rifles
through his other pockets. Not there. Oh shit. Rising
panic. He lost it.
RONSEL
Goddammit... No, no, no.
FLORENCE
What is it son?
RONSEL
You seen a letter?
FLORENCE
The letter from Germany?
Yes.

RONSEL

FLORENCE
Oh God. Let’s just wait. Don’t
fret. Wait till your father-Ronsel busts out of the shack and back into the night.
Ronsel?

FLORENCE (CONT’D)
Ronsel!

100.
EXT. MISSISSIPPI ROAD - DAY
The threat of thunder has turned into reality of pounding
rain. Ronsel runs to the spot where he told Jamie about the
letter. He looks around desperately. He finds the empty
whiskey bottle with the label Jamie picked off.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - DAY
Laura is in the kitchen. Amanda Leigh and Isabelle are on
the floor playing with building blocks. Pappy lingers by the
window, anxiously waiting.
PAPPY
Goddammit, where is he?
LAURA
(re: the girls)
Mind your language, please.
PAPPY
Just like him. Thinking only of
himself.
(then)
There he is.
Outside the truck pulls up, weaving badly.
and stumbles to the house.
PAPPY (CONT’D)
Drunk again.
Jamie enters, rumpled, wet and smiling.
JAMIE
Well, hello, dear family.
AMANDA LEIGH/ISABELLE
Uncle Jamie!
LAURA
Let him dry off first.
PAPPY
Who in the hell was that with you
in the truck?
JAMIE
Hello, son. I’m glad to see you.
PAPPY
On the road. When I saw you
driving. Who was that?

Jamie gets out

101.
JAMIE
Ronsel Jackson. What’s it to you?
PAPPY
You care to tell me why that nigger
was sitting right next to you like
you was two peas in a pod?
JAMIE
Because I was giving him a ride.
PAPPY
He can ride in the back.
JAMIE
He can ride wherever I say.
Anything else?
PAPPY
Gimmie a cigarette.

I’m out.

Jamie stares at him for a beat then pulls out an old pack of
Lucky Strikes. Pappy snatches them. It’s empty.
PAPPY (CONT'D)
You ain’t worth a damn, you know
that?
JAMIE
Yeah. I do.
Jamie wobbles.
PAPPY
Look at mister big war hero.
Nothing but a drunk.
Just go.

LAURA

PAPPY
Want him all to yourself huh, gal?
Too bad he’s too liquored up to be
any good to you.
LAURA
I beg your pardon.
PAPPY
I’ve seen the way you sniff after
him -Pappy.

JAMIE

102.
PAPPY
Henry may be too thick to notice,
but I ain’t.
EXT. MISSISSIPPI ROAD - NIGHT
Rain as Ronsel trudges up the road. Then he reacts to the
crescendo of approaching cars. He turns and sees two sets of
headlights approaching fast.
Ronsel jumps down into the ditch. But instead of passing,
the cars pull up and stop. Ronsel is a bit blinded by the
headlights and the rain. But soon several figures in white
sheets and hoods pile out of the cars and rush at him.
Ronsel runs but they are on him like a pack of dogs. He
fights and struggles, landing several hard punches. But he’s
outnumbered.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - NIGHT
Rain beats on the roof as Jamie sleeps on his cot. A beat
then he is poked awake by Pappy’s cane. Jamie bolts up,
startled to see Pappy. Orris Stokes and the Sheriff are
behind him in white robes.
JAMIE
What the hell’s going on?
PAPPY
Put your boots on and come with us.
EXT. SAW MILL - NIGHT
Hard rain. Orris Stokes’ car pulls up and stops among some
other parked cars. Jamie, Pappy, and Orris Stokes get out
and move towards the saw mill. We can see torch lights
coming from inside the mill. As they go, the Sheriff and
Stokes don their white hoods. This gives Jamie pause and he
stops. But Stokes shoves him along.
Go on.

STOKES

They open the door to the saw mill and enter.
INT. SAW MILL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Inside are a group of men in KKK garb. In the middle of the
mill is Ronsel. He has a burlap sack over his head, a noose
around his neck and his hands tied behind him. He’s strung
up from a rafter, his tip-toes barely touching the ground.
One of the white hoods holds the other end of the rope.
Another man (DEX) stands nearby with a shotgun.

103.
JAMIE
What’s going on here, Pappy?
Shut up.

PAPPY

SHERIFF THACKER
(re: Ronsel)
Take it off.
Dex moves to Ronsel and yanks the sack off his head. As his
eyes adjust to the light we see that Ronsel has been beat up.
Good Lord.

JAMIE
Turn him loose.

PAPPY
I said shut up.
JAMIE
Like hell I will.
dammit.

Turn him loose,

Stokes pulls his pistol and levels it at Jamie:
STOKES
You best listen, son.
JAMIE
I ain’t your son. And I suggest
you either use that thing or point
it elsewhere.
Jamie readies lunge at Stokes.
Jamie!

PAPPY

SHERIFF THACKER
Bring forth the evidence.
One of the white hoods moves forward and brings out the
letter and the photograph from Resl. Both Jamie and Ronsel
see it and sink. The white hood hands it to Pappy.
SHERIFF THACKER (CONT’D)
You know why you’re here, nigger?
(off Ronsel’s silence)
I asked you a question.
Ronsel stays silent. Sheriff throws a nod to Orris who walks
over to Ronsel and slugs him with a left and then a right to
the ribs. The thuds from the blows force grunts from Ronsel.

104.
Jamie winces. But Ronsel stays as cool.
them his fear.

He will not show

Pappy walks up to Ronsel and shows him the letter and the
picture of Resl and Franz. Ronsel eyes the photo.
SHERIFF THACKER (CONT’D)
Did you rut with this woman?
PAPPY
We know you did it, nigger. We
just want to hear you say it.
The white hood holding the rope jerks it.
Go on!

STOKES
Say it!

JAMIE
What the hell do you fellows care
about some Kraut whore?
STOKES
Shut your mouth, nigger lover.
PAPPY
You knew about it. Found the
letter in the truck after you gave
him a ride.
JAMIE
Those Fräulein cunts got a lot of
our boys killed. If Ronsel here
left her with a little half-breed
bundle of joy to remind her of it,
I call it justice.
Jamie’s logic lands for a moment and there’s hope.
SHERIFF THACKER
Oh you’re good, pretty boy.
bad you’re full of shit.

Too

JAMIE
How do you even know that Ronsel
here, is the father?
PAPPY
Says so right there in the letter.
JAMIE
That doesn’t mean a damn thing.

105.
STOKES
Well, let’s ask him, why don’t we?
(to Ronsel re: the photo)
Are you the father of this, I won’t
call it a child, this...
abomination?
SHERIFF THACKER
Answer him!
The noose tightens. Ronsel won’t deny his own son and he
manages to choke out the word:
Yes...

RONSEL

SHERIFF THACKER
Leviticus 19:19. “Ye shall keep my
statutes. Thou shalt not let thy
cattle gender with a diverse kind.
Thou shalt not sow thy field with
mingled seed.” The penalty for
abomination is death.
JAMIE
Have you all lost your damn minds?!
Killing a decorated soldier over an
enemy whore?! The man fought for
Patton for Godsakes -STOKES
That’s enough -JAMIE
You turn him loose now and maybe I
won’t go to the law. Otherwise, I
swear, you better kill us both.
Stokes can’t believe the nerve of Jamie and he moves towards
him with the gun.
PAPPY
You gonna betray your own blood
over a nigger?!
Pappy tries to stand between Stokes and Jamie, but Jamie
shoves him out of the way. Stokes points the gun at Jamie.
Jamie steps up and puts the gun barrel to his own forehead.
Do it.

JAMIE
Go on.

105A.
The entire room hangs on the tension for a long beat. Then,
quick as a cat, Jamie swipes the gun with one hand and
PUNCHES Stokes in the mouth with the other. Stokes’s head
snaps back and he stumbles backwards and falls. Jamie
quickly turns to Dex who has the shotgun.

106.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Drop it, Dex!
Dex hesitates and Jamie cocks the hammer.
DROP IT!

JAMIE (CONT’D)

PAPPY
He’s bluffing. And half drunk
besides.
JAMIE
Shut up, old man.
PAPPY
Point the gun at the nigger.
Pappy moves right into Jamie’s eye line, blocking his shot.
PAPPY (CONT’D)
He won’t shoot. He don’t have the
balls to kill a man up close. Do
you, son?
Dex points the shotgun at Ronsel.
Jamie.
JAMIE
Stop right there.

Pappy steps closer to

I’m warning you.

PAPPY
You not gon’ kill your Pappy.
Then one of the white hoods charges at Jamie. Jamie turns
and shoots him in the leg. But that was enough to give the
others a chance to rush in.
Jamie squeezes off another shot that misses before he gets
tackled. In the subsequent melee, they somehow manage to

But Jamie punches, kicks and gives everything he’s got,
fighting like a cornered animal. But soon, they overwhelm
him. And they proceed to beat the shit out of him.
Jamie and Ronsel lock eyes for a moment during the beating.
Then a kick to the head from Stokes.
CUT TO BLACK.
PAPPY’S VOICE FADES IN, echo-y and distant.

Wake up!

PAPPY (V.O.)
Jamie! Wake up dammit!
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. THE SAW MILL - NIGHT
Jamie is awakened by a bucket of cold rain water. He is
bruised, blurry and dazed. But as focus restores he sees a
mass of white hoods staring down at him.
Among the hoods is Pappy’s face. Jamie recoils and tries to
push him away but his hands are tied behind his back. Pappy
yanks him upright and props him against the wall. Jamie sees
that Ronsel now hangs from a cross-beam, naked and bloodied.
PAPPY
You make one more wrong move these
boys are liable to kill you.
STOKES
(re: Jamie)
What do we do with him?
PAPPY
I told you already. He won’t talk.
Ain’t that right, son?
JAMIE
(re: Ronsel)
Just let him go.

You ain’t exactly in a position to
make demands.

He won’t go to the law.

Alright then. What’ll it be?

No.

Then

JAMIE

Stokes unsheathes a HUNTING KNIFE:
You will.

STOKES
Or I will.

Dex moves to Ronsel and puts the shotgun to Ronsel’s head.
SHERIFF THACKER
I’ll give you a choice. His eyes.
His tongue. Or his balls. Choose.
(off Jamie’s silence)
Choose godammit!
No...
Dex -Alright!

JAMIE
STOKES
JAMIE
Alright...

Jamie locks eyes with Ronsel.

This is an impossible choice.

SHERIFF THACKER
Which is it, boy?
Jamie’s head drops and he mumbles something.
Speak up.

DOC TURPIN

As Turpin leans in the RISING MUSIC and the SOUNDS OF THE
STORM OUTSIDE TAKE OVER.
Then in a SERIES OF FLASHES:
--Jamie says something to the Sheriff that we cannot hear.
--Stokes turns towards Ronsel with the knife.
--White hoods hold a struggling Ronsel.
--Stokes grabs Ronsel by the face and forces his mouth open.
--Jamie can’t look and he averts his eyes.

109.
--Ronsel’s strange muffled screams
--Stokes slices and BLOOD spurts from Ronsel’s mouth and
stains some of the white robes around him.
SMASH TO BLACK.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BARN - NIGHT
Jamie is thrown onto his bed, wet, beaten and unconscious.
Pappy and Orris Stokes glower above him. Stokes drifts out.
Pappy frozen, staring at Jamie. He removes his son’s boots.
Throws a horse blanket over him. Jamie sputters in his sleep.
A confusion of feelings mottle Pappy’s face.
EXT. THE SAW MILL - SAME TIME INTERCUT
Hap, Marlon, Florence, and OTHER BLACK DEACONS push the door
open and enter the scene of the crucifixion. Ronsel hangs
bleeding from the crossbeam, the Black Messiah. Hap and
Marlon immediately set to levering him down. Florence’s hand
goes to her mouth.
INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - NIGHT - LATER
Driving rain and howling wind outside. Pappy sleeps
peacefully, his breathing deep and steady. A LIGHTNING FLASH
accompanied by THUNDER briefly ILLUMINATES the room.
Several beats, then more THUNDER and LIGHTNING and we see
Jamie standing by Pappy’s bedside. He stares at Pappy as he
clinches the pillow in his hands. Then finally he shakes
Pappy violently:
Wake up.

JAMIE

Pappy jerks awake and squints up at Jamie:
PAPPY
The hell are you doing, boy?
JAMIE
I wanted to make sure I looked you
in the eye.
With that Jamie shoves the pillow onto Pappy’s face. Pappy
thrashes and claws. Jamie presses harder. Then soon the
thrashing weakens. Pappy’s leg kicks become twitches and his
hands loose from Jamie’s. And then Pappy is still. Jamie
holds the pillow there for several more beats. Then, slowly
he pulls it from Pappy’s face. Pappy’s eyes are wide and his
mouth agape.

Florence touches his chest, howls in sorrow. She cups her

INT. THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - DAY
Where Laura KNOCKS on the door.
No answer. Perplexed, she pushes the door open and enters.
She reacts when she sees Pappy eyes wide open, lifeless and
frozen in shock. Then she reaches out, touches his skin and
quickly recoils from the cold.
She scans Jamie’s empty bed. Something on the floor catches
her eye. She reaches down and picks it up. It’s Pappy’s
white hood. Laura holds it up and sees the eye holes and
realizes.
JAMIE (O.S.)
It’s exactly what you think it is.
Laura sees Jamie sitting in the corner clutching the pillow
he smothered Pappy with. She reacts to his beat up face:
LAURA
What happened to you?
(off his desolate look)
What happened, Jamie? Jamie.
Jamie reaches into a pocket and fishes out the crumpled photo
of Resl and Ronsel’s son. Laura looks at it, confused.
JAMIE

it... there were too many of
them...

Jamie shakes his head, twists the pillow in his fists. Laura
looks to Pappy, Jamie finally meets her gaze. Laura gently
pries the pillow from Jamie’s hands.

EXT. THE MCALLAN FARM - LATER
A truck drives up the road and stops. Henry gets out with a
bag. He waves and nods to the driver. Laura and Jamie move
out towards Henry.
Jamie has cleaned up and changed his clothes, but he’s still
beat up. Jamie and Laura approach Henry as he kneels at his
crops. He flicks a glance at them, more concerned with the
cotton.
HENRY
Got back as soon as I could. If
this keeps up we’ll have to
replant. Almanac predicted-Henry.

Jamie nods then Henry hugs him. Jamie, racked with guilt and
pain, hugs back. PRELAP the RUMBLE of THUNDER and...

Hap pulls his arm away and steps down. Florence spits over
the side of the wagon and glares at the McAllans.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Thank you for stopping.
Hap takes an end of the rope, Henry eyes Marlon.
HENRY (CONT’D)
Maybe he can help too?

113.
HAP
My son is not getting down outta
that wagon.
Henry swallows this.
Okay.

HENRY

Henry takes two end of the rope, Hap and Jamie each take one
and they maneuver the coffin down into the hole. The coffin
touches bottom and they pull the ropes back up. Henry stares
down at the coffin for a beat then:
HENRY (CONT’D)
We forgot to bring a bible.
Hap looks to the sky and cocks his head like he’s listening
to something. Then he bows it and pulls a small, tattered
bible from inside his jacket.
HAP
Done this plenty of times.
HENRY
Thank you, Hap. But no.
LAURA
If he’s willing to we should allow
it. He is a man of God.
JAMIE
I say we let him.
HENRY
(after a begrudging beat)
Go on then.
Hap flips to a certain page as they all bow their heads. A
beat, then Hap closes the Bible and quotes from memory. His
voice is strong and ringing. He’s not trying to comfort the
bereaved. He’s sending Pappy to Hell:
HAP
Man who is born of a woman is of
few days and full of trouble. He
cometh forth like a flower, and is
cut down: he fleeth as a shadow,
and continueth not. And dost thou
open thine eyes upon such a one,
and bringest me into judgment with
thee? Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? Not one.

114.
Henry frowns, not appreciating the tone or content of the
sermon. Laura holds his hand, Jamie looks up:
HAP (CONT’D)
For there is hope of a tree, if it
be cut down, that it will sprout
again. Through the scent of water
it will bud like a plant. But man
dieth, and wasteth away. As the
waters fail from the sea and drieth
up, so man lieth down, and riseth
not. Till the heavens be no more,
they shall not awake, nor be raised
out of their sleep. Amen.
Amen
Amen.

LAURA
JAMIE

Henry is silent. His head still down, he starts shovelling
angry mounds of dirt onto the grave. Hap tips his hat and
makes for the wagon.
Hap, wait.

JAMIE (CONT’D)

Jamie moves to where the tarp hangs.
but he knows who’s in there:

He can’t see inside,

JAMIE (CONT’D)
Give this to Ronsel? If you see
him.
Jamie pulls out the photo of Resl and Franz. Florence reaches
out and takes the photo. Jamie and Florence hold a long
look. Jamie’s eyes well up with guilt. Hap manages a
forgiving nod then spurs the mule on. Off Jamie watching
them go...he looks back at his brother shovelling dirt. Laura
eyes plead with him. Jamie turns away and keeps on walking. A
lone man on a muddy road.

Jamie, small pack slung over his shoulder walks through the
grand lobby. He reaches into a pocket, pulls out a flask and
takes a couple swigs.
JAMIE (V.O.)
Whenever Ronsel enters my mind I
hope that he is well.
We STAY WITH him as he moves outside to... Sunshine. Palm
trees. A clear view of the mountains in the distance. Jamie
squints. The dry heat feels good on his face. Then as he
moves off:

1940’s LA noir style. As Jamie smokes a cigarette at an open
window with a blinking sign out front. A PRETTY WOMAN pours
bourbon. It’s a hot night and she crosses naked to the bed
with two sweating glasses. Jamie draws on his cigarette then
follows her to the bed.
JAMIE (V.O.)
But until then I am content to stay
perpetually numb. All the while
hoping that by some miracle my
friend, Ronsel, found happiness.

But I often miss my brother and

Laura waddles out onto the porch and we see that she is VERY
PREGNANT. Henry pulls up in his truck and gets out. The
girls see Henry and run to him.
LAURA (V.O.)
I would never tell Henry the truth
about this child. Jamie’s child.
That would only serve to clear my
conscience, not his. It’s a small
bit of dignity that I can give back
to him. Though he has no idea I’ve
taken it.
Henry moves up to the porch and gives Laura a hug and warm
kiss on the lips. Then he bends and kisses her belly. And
for the first time ever, we see Henry truly smile.
LAURA (V.O.)
I’ve learned that’s what it is to
truly love someone: to give
