SOARING OVER
AN INFINITE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE OF SOLAR PANELS AND PLASTIC

Finally giving way to -EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.

This is K. You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better.
Refined features, flawless skin. Intelligent eyes that

masks wry for earnest.

K’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead.
K directs the Spinner towards...
EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.
TRAVELLING WITH THE SPINNER over remains of abandoned
greenhouses. PLASTIC DOMES over what were once POOLS.
A windmill stands above it all. Slowly, creakily rotating.
Its bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6
o’clock... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... creakCLACK...

The Spinner’s SHADOW rolls over the windmill.

Approaching --

EXT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.
Cement walls and corrugated tin roof.
Beside it a PLASTIC TENTED POOL.

An old school maybe.

INT. TENTED POOL. DAY.
Under a translucent dome. A bull of a FARMER stands knee
deep in a pool full of sludge, raking a nutrient rich
solution. Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into
vertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS.
The Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe.
Hood and goggles cover his face. He takes up a handful of
NEMATODES, pleased with his crop. Looks up as -THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.
The Farmer sets down his rake.
EXT. FARMHOUSE.
The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking
up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it.
A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the
Spinner, A PILOTFISH.
K emerges from the dust. Whatever color his coat was, it’s
brown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture. It
TAKES OFF.
K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse. ONE TREE in sight,
a giant, DEAD, leafless thing. A ghost of grandiosity,
standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down.
INT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
K crosses creaking floors. Looks around: Kalsomined walls,
pitted windows. All old, but clean. Someone takes pride.
Basic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO. Otherwise EMPTY. No
decor, shelves BARE.
K inspects the few items. Sheet music for CHOPIN on the
piano. An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow...
A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove...

K re-lids the pot, as --

K leans

Rattling the whole house.

3.
EXT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
The Farmer approaches his home. Air HISSES in at the
unfastening of his MASK. He eyes the Spinner parked beyond
the tree. Sees the Pilotfish hovering above. Pulls a chain.
A DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit, which he can
now unsnap.
This is SAPPER MORTON. Weathered 60s. A well-broken nose.
Yet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses.

Sapper steps in.

The floor creaks under his

He scans the room. Empty. Sapper moves to a sink where he
violently scrubs his hands. He does not yet see K.
K leans from a shadow into the light. A stranger, suddenly
visible. Briefly ominous. An uncertain moment...
K
(polite)
Hope you don’t mind me taking the
liberty. Wind’s a bit unkind out there.
I was careful not to track in any dirt.
Sapper eyes K’s chummy posture. Dismisses any threat.
SAPPER
I do not mind dirt.
unannounced visits.

I do mind
You police?

K
Sapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?
SAPPER
I’m a farmer.
K
(genuinely interested)
I saw that. What do you farm?
SAPPER
This is a protein farm.

Wallace design.

Sapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single
wriggling WORM.
SAPPER (cont’d)
It only takes the one to start.
Parthenogenic strain. Constant doubling.
They’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet.

4.
K
Is that what I smell?
K looks to that inviting pot on the stove. Sapper shakes his
head, pleased with himself. Opens a cupboard, where a grow
light nourishes PLANTS. A few FLOWERS. And a bottle
terrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS.
SAPPER
Grow this just for me.
Garlic.
He looks.

Garlic.

K
The pot on the stove bubbles and steams.
SAPPER
Whole town farmed it back once. Smelled
this good a hundred miles in circle.
Try some?
K
No thank you. I prefer to keep a cold
stomach until the hard part of the day’s
behind me. How long you been here?
SAPPER
Since ’20. Came by it honest too if
that’s what you’re after.
K
But you weren’t a farmer prior.
Sapper cocks his head at the comment.

K notes the SATCHEL at

it? Military issue. Heat resistant.

He takes off his

SAPPER
Planning on taking me in? Huh? Take a
look inside. See what they missed.
REVEAL:

Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel.

Not likely.

K
If taking you in is an option, I’d much
prefer that over the alternative.

5.
K puts his gun on the table.
K (cont’d)
You had to know it’d be someone in time.
Sorry it’s me.
K stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket.
SAPPER
Good as any.
K activates the scanner.
K
If you’d look up and to the left please.
The FIGHT is quick and it is fierce:
Sapper stabs towards K’s heart. K avoids the blade, only his
coat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck
deep into the wall. K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife,
which skids to the floor.
K DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head
just was. Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar, lifting him
into the air and slamming him into the wall over and over -until K’s body GOES THROUGH IT, and -K crashes onto the floor in the next room.
K recovers quickly, strangely able to withstand the
punishment. He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish
the job.
Sapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K
gasping for air.
K gets out of Sapper’s grip, and lashes out in rapid
succession, his solar plexus, his chin, his throat, crushing
his windpipe. His blows are SURGICAL, anatomically precise,
like viper bites.
Sapper is stunned, choking, in pain. K kicks Sappers’ knee
and the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree.
K SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING
UPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS... FLAILS... hand reaching...
For the dropped SCALPEL... GRASPING IT!
HE STABS K in the SHOULDER.
K accepts the wound and the pain.

Only squeezes tighter.

6.
Sapper’s EYES ROLL BACK -- the desired effect -- REVEALING:
A PINPRICK OF COLOR on the underside of the right EYEBALL.
K draws the SCANNER -- which reads the point like a bar code.
It confirms Sapper’s ID.
K stops holding back -- SNAPS Sapper’s remaining good arm -grabs his GUN that has fallen on the floor beside the table.
K (cont’d)
Please don’t get up.
Sapper raises up still fighting for air.
SAPPER
How does it feel, killing your own kind?
K
I don’t retire my own kind.

We don’t

SAPPER
You new models. You’re happy scraping
the shit. You’ve never seen a miracle.
Sapper gives a zealot’s grin. Ready to die for a cause only
he understands. Eager for it. HE RUSHES K.
THE GUN THUNDERS.
HOLD ON THE GUN.

So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP.

K breathes heavy.
FINGERS.

Checks his wound.

Sees his BLOOD on his

Blood trickles onto fallen sheet music.

Staining Chopin.

K smooths himself back to dignity. Leans over the body.
Then PAUSES. Crosses the room. Finds a spoon. Hesitates.
Tastes the soup.

Hmmm.

Garlic.

EXT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
K steps out. Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the
dense clouds. The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm.
In one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES. In the other he holds
a small, clear CASE. INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE. He staggers
toward his Spinner. Gestures to the Pilotfish.
K
Photograph everything.
The Pilotfish rises to take pictures of the farm.

7.
INT. SPINNER.
K taps a button on the dash.

An LAPD LOGO comes up.

K
Madam, please.
ON SCREEN comes the perpetually disappointed face of LT.
JOSHI. A 50ish woman. Ambitious, officious, impatient. K’s
backtalk gives fuel to her irritation so she tolerates it.
Or maybe she just likes the look of him. More than she
should. She sees his BLOODY shoulder.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
You’re hurt. I’m not paying for that.
K
I’ll glue it.
And?

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
In answer K holds up the CASE with SAPPER’S EYE. The
pinprick of his CODE below the cornea. It SCANS. Sapper’s
SERIAL NUMBER and history open. A NEXUS 8 for the curious.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN) (cont’d)
One of the tail end Nexus 8s before
Prohibition. Looks like he could take
your head off.
K
He thought about it.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Field medic, standard ocular ID upgrades,
open end lifespan, now ended. He went
AWOL after Calantha with a few more in
his outfit I wouldn’t mind closing out.
Just him?
MORE NEXUS 8 IDs flit by.

All wanting to be retired.

K
Just the one.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Between the retirement and the bleed
you’ll see a tidy bonus. Less mine.
K
Can I get it today?

8.
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
I don’t know what you all do with cash in
pocket anyway. Come on home for your
baseline.
Something catches K’s eye. By that TREE. Low to the ground.
The smallest pop of YELLOW... against a dirt brown world.
K
Moment, Madam.
EXT. FARMHOUSE.
He kneels at the foot of the tree to find:
A SINGLE, SLENDER COWSLIP.

Left leaning against a root.

K lifts it to his eye. As if moved by its delicacy. He
considers the long dead tree. Gestures to the Pilotfish -There.

K
30 meters to maximum depth.

The Pilotfish begins a spiral over the area.
ON THE SCREEN: An ULTRASOUND of the ground below. Root
systems. A cracked foundation. And there, buried DEEP under
the tree... A SMALL SEALED SQUARE FOOTLOCKER.
Joshi sees it in her office as well.

Annoyed at more work.

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
What is that?
K
It’s down in deep.
Madam?

Send a dig team,

Joshi SIGHS, annoyed.
K (cont’d)
Should I find a shovel, spare your night?
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
(yes, but...)
You better get back ahead of the storm.
The Pilotfish attaches itself to the spinner as it takes off.
Camera moves toward the tree as we -CUT TO:

9.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT.
LIGHTNING shatters the sky into irregular jigsaw shapes.
Indeed, there is a storm collecting to the north. We are...
SOARING OVER
The breathtaking cityscape skyline of dystopian grime. 30
years older. Sweatier. Sucked of oxygen. If LA then was a
giant oil refinery then, now it is industrial bones jutting
out of a new city built atop the old. And spread far as the
eye can see. What were streets are canyons that cut deep
down to the strata below. Who knows how far.
K’S SPINNER
Is a single bulb in the Christmas tree. Part of the SPINNER
TRAFFIC that lights up the sky. Now gliding for the city’s
poorer, uglier center. A seizure of ADVERTISEMENT,
interactive and bright. In the distance is a massive
structure: THE SEPULVEDA SEAWALL.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Subject: Officer K D6-dash-3-dot-7.
Let’s begin. Ready?
Yes, Sir.

K (O.S.)
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Recite your baseline.
We see K through his rain streaked windshield as the Spinner
banks and begins its descent toward a grey cinder block of a
building. RUNNING LIGHTS illuminate a LANDING PAD at the top
of the LAPD TOWER / DIVISION 5.
K (O.S.)
“And blood-black nothingness began to
spin / A system of cells interlinked
within / Cells interlinked within cells
interlinked / Within one stem.”
INT. POLICE STATION. PROCESSING HALL. NIGHT.
Lifeless architecture. Huge, with worn out plastic features.
Call it functional to be nice.
Though it is late it is CROWDED. Bloody-nosed K walks
through a chaotic hive of crime processing. CRIMINALS
pleading cases at plexi-covered booths... or shouting into
payport phone banks...
The HUMAN COPS still manage to get in K’s way, sure to remind
him of his place and esteem as a Replicant.

10.
COP
Fuck off, Skinjob.
If that bothers K he does not let on.
K (O.S.)
“And dreadfully distinct / Against the
dark, a tall white fountain played.”
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
A clinical room that was white a decade ago maybe.
INTERVIEWER can be heard but not seen.

The

The long barrelled LENS of a specialized CAMERA slides back
and forth to find its specific focus on K, who sits on a
stool. Coat off and on his lap. Dry blood on his cut shirt.
He stares ahead at the camera. Compliant and still.
The CAMERA alters its focus accusingly.

Locks in.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)

Cells.

K
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Have you ever been in an institution?
Cells.

K
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Do they keep you in a cell. Cells.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
When you are not performing your duties
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
What’s it like to hold the hand of
someone you love. Interlinked.
K
Interlinked.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Did they teach you how to feel, finger to
finger? Interlinked.
K
Interlinked.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Do you long for having your heart
interlinked. Interlinked.
K
Interlinked.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Do you dream about being interlinked?
Interlinked.
A moment’s hesitation.

Then --

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
What’s it like to hold your child in your
arms? Interlinked.
K

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Do you feel like there is a part of you
that is missing? Interlinked.
K
Interlinked.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Within cells interlinked.
K
Within cells interlinked.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Say that three times. Within cells
interlinked.

12.
K
Within cells interlinked. Within cells
interlinked. Within cells interlinked.
A pause, a grinding of unseen machinery, the camera powering
down, then -INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
(kindly)
We’re done. Constant K. You can pick up
your bonus.
K’s eyes look to the eye of the camera.
K
Thank you, Sir.
CUT TO:
EXT. CITY STREET.
A POLICE SPINNER glides low overhead. A small ADVERTISEMENT
DRONE hovers like an insect, projecting 3D ads in the smoggy
atmosphere. A HUGE SNOW MELTING MACHINE moves down the
street, clearing the slush. It passes to REVEAL -K. He pushes past the occlusion of PEOPLE buttoned against
the cold. Crosses the windblown street. Gutters heaped with
dirty snow as more dirty snow falls. Fat, sooty flakes.
He carries a newly purchased PACKAGE under his arm.

A grand, old office building.

TILT DOWN the building’s

INT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX.
The office building has been hastily and cheaply retrofitted
for residential living. DENSELY crowded with FAMILY LIFE.
The many RESIDENTS, too poor or genetically problematic to
get Off-World, treat the halls and stairway landings like a
dorm commons. An extension of their own homes.
Pungent signs of ethnicity everywhere. Colors, carpets,
clothes. As many languages as shades of skin. K gives a nod
of acknowledgment to a man smoking in the hall. Is
acknowledged back with a stream of foreign epithets that
follow him up...
INT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX. CONTINUED.
FIND K ON THE STAIRS

13.
Walking up 80 stories. Stiff from the fight. An OLD WOMAN
bumps into him, expecting him to get out of her way. No one
he passes the least glad to see a Replicant.
INT. HALLWAY.
K crosses the hall. ALL his NEIGHBORS’ DOORS are open like
market stalls letting in air and letting out CHILDREN. Every
home thickly filled, like a hoarder’s garage. Some host
SHOPS. FOOD STALLS. Every floor like a town square.
K walks past and to his apartment. A BOY, brown-faced,
missing an ear, looking up at K, with curiosity and fear.
K opens the lock. Disappears inside. The only one to close
his door, which is tagged with a GRAFFITI: “FUCK OFF
SKINNER.”
EXT. K’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
PUSH IN ON K’S WINDOW, as a LIGHT turns on within...
INT. K’S APARTMENT.
A sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors.
No pretense of cultural heritage. A simple chair. On its
arm a valueless paperback novel, well-thumbed, noted,
creased. Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens, not
that we make a thing of it.
K walks in with his package, trying to be discreet, he hides
it as...
He turns on a CONSOLE. Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER, which spins a
SINATRA song, “Summer Winds.”
K takes off his coat. Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear
in the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it.
K!

WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)

K plays at indignation but is glad for her thoughtfulness.
K’s life is not lonely and that is something in this world.
K drinks the two drinks poured, sits to eat the meal he made.
JOI (O.S.) (cont’d)
Did you know this song was released in
1966 on Reprise Records? It was number 1
on the charts... Won’t be much longer.
Finishing touches.
He opens a CASE. Inside:
sets ONE onto an ashtray.
We hear CUTLERY gather.
Ok, ready!

Five cigarettes.

We hear FOOTSTEPS.

JOI (O.S.) (cont’d)
I think you’ll like it.

K
I told you not to fuss.
And yet.
REVEAL:

JOI (O.S.)
JOI.

Not a real woman at all. A digital companion. PROJECTED from
a hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling,
and restricting her existence to this space. Goddess,
girlfriend, geisha and, right now, goddamn bombshell.
Ingeniously real in every way except the one that counts.
She holds a plate of steak frites. Not real of course. An
illusion of satisfaction. Just like Joi in her APRON over a
sweater set and pearls. Waiting for him with dinner on the
table and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife.
(NOTE: Joi cannot interact with physical objects. Any
“object” she manipulates is a holo representation, like her.
Nor does she move when unobserved by K; when he turns away
for any length of time she shifts into idle animations.)
Voila.

JOI (cont’d)
Bon appetit.

She sets the plate atop his sad prefab bowl of actual food.
Kisses him on the cheek.
CLOSE ON: HIS SKIN. Brushed by the butterfly kiss of her
cloud. Palpable but not tangible.

16.
JOI (cont’d)
I missed you, babysweet.
K
Honey, it’s beautiful.
JOI
Just put your feet up.

Relax.

K is moved by the gesture. He puts the cigarette to his
lips. Joi leans in close. Puts up a finger... Juuuust
teasingly touching the tip of the cigarette... until... a
tiny STATIC SPARK ignites an ember.
He draws, and his cigarette lights. He blows the smoke into
Joi, making her hologram all the more dense and real.
They look at each other. Joi studies him.

It was a day.
Her form seamlessly reverts back to her lissome baseline.
Companionate, respectable, smart. The way he likes her. She
“picks up” his copy of “Pale Fire,” hoping to cheer him up.

She straightens. Arm up to receive his and be led, wearing
now a beautiful dress. And with that Joi wins. K has no
choice but to put his day behind him.
JOI (cont’d)
You wanna dance, or you wanna open your
present?

A present?

JOI (cont’d)
Joi looks elated.
JOI (cont’d)
What’s the occasion?
K
Our anniversary.
Is it?
K smiles.

JOI
Of course not.

He opens the box on... A DIGITAL DEVICE, size of a King Size
Snickers. Joi visibly brightens with excitement.
K
Happy Anniversary.

K presses the console.

Joi hesitates only a moment then...

A RESTART CHIME. A LOGO floats off the emanator: A SPHERE,
surrounded by smaller spheres in orbit. WALLACE CORP, E&C.
K taps the emanator and, with a CHIME... Joi comes back
online. THE EMANATOR conjures her even more realistically in
every way. She moves about, her image unbroken as it was
when projected from the hard line. She TWIRLS about, the
pleats in the new dress conjured for the effect billow out.
She loves it.
JOI
Oh thank you thank you thank you!

You can go anywhere in the world.

EXT. ROOFTOP. STORMING. NIGHT.
ON JOI. Rapt, eyes fixed on the gorgeous fractal skyline.
The rain passes through her projection. In a well-programmed
nod to physics her clothes get “wet,” stick to her skin.
LIGHTNING FIRES ABOVE.

Joi does not flinch.

K raises his coat to cover the rain.

Only flickers.

Joi stays his hand.

JOI
Stay like this. The light catches your
skin. You look like me. If you’re not
too cold...
He’s not.

Stays wet.
JOI (cont’d)
I’m so happy when I’m with you.
K
You don’t have to say that.

Joi “takes” his hand. Static heightened by the conductive
water clinging to his skin. She leads his hand to her waist.
As if to dance.
She leans in close to his neck. Her exhaled “breath” tickles
his lips. A smoky wet dream. He kisses her. She looks deep
in his eyes. K kisses her neck, slowly... not breaking the
illusion... The moment intensifies-- her breath escaping -HER IMAGE GOES STATIC -THEN FREEZES -- her face in a rictus of ecstacy, gorgeous in
motion but the single frame out of context appears vulgar.
Joi’s face replaced by AN EMERGENCY PAGE. “VOICE MESSAGE.
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED.” The POLICE LOGO. His time is
entirely owned. The message plays:

INT. MORGUE. POLICE STATION. MOMENTS LATER.
ON A MACHINE. MOVING OVER A SKELETON ON AN EXAMINATION
TABLE. Bones clean. Half assembled, half still in a 2X2X2
footlocker. A thick BRAID of HAIR CURLED beside it. An
AUTOPSY is visible taking place in an adjacent room as --

A TECHNICIAN takes out the remaining bones one by one, and
unwraps them -- as each has been individually wrapped in
cotton rags with ritualistic care. A small bag contains the
full set of teeth, which the Technician sets under a scanner.

crush to purchase food and drink. And entertainments.
Particularly outside...

An unabashed sex den. PATRONS enter to taste and experience
with no more shame than they would the vending machines.
IN THE DOORWAY -- A PATRON flirts with his crassly customized
JOI diji, both ignoring the DOXIES hustling to earn a living.
As some do, as evidenced by the SHADOWS OF COUPLES WRITHING
on the plexi front windows.

Luv steps over the stone path across the pond to the far end,
by an arrangement of decadent chairs. There is a nervous
clip to her voice.

A VOICE ECHOES in reply, coming from everywhere.

Yes, Sir.

LUV
Wallace stands, walks toward the Model.
NIANDER WALLACE
We were meant to reach beyond the
firmament. We should read our books by
the light of a thousand different stars.
Every one a home. Till we lose count.
That’s the future of the species if
there’s to be one. We simply need more
Angels to carry us aloft.

LUV
He runs the SCALPEL’S dull edge under the Model’s CHIN to
raise it. Stills her when she again shivers.
NIANDER WALLACE
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce. We
lost our stomach for slaves. Unless...
engineered. And I can only make so many.
He runs the dull edge along the entire length of the Model.
NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
To make this I have to build from whole
cloth. Bit by bit and at great expense.
Shameful inefficiency, built into
Tyrell’s template. Tyrell.
He touches the Model’s abdomen at the navel.
NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
That barren pasture, empty and salted.
Right there. The dead space between the
stars. This the seat that we must change
for Heav’n.
With a swift motion he CUTS the Model across the ABDOMEN.
She stands for an uneasy moment as he continues:
NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
I cannot breed them. I have tried, so
help me. Tyrell’s final puzzle in
adamantine chains and penal Fire.
He drops the scalpel.
NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
We need more Replicants than can ever be

trillions. More. Worlds beyond worlds,
diamond shores. We could storm Eden and
retake her...

Deferential, as if this was her place not his.
JOSHI
I’ve known a lot of your kind. All useful
but... with you I sometimes forget... We
didn’t have any of you where I was a kid.
She empties her glass. Pours again. K’s eye doesn’t leave
her pour -- we see she is using K’s single beloved book for a
coaster, spills a little. No idea it’s precious to him.
JOSHI (cont’d)
You don’t remember anything before you
were under me, do you? You have any
memories from before?
K
I have memories. They give us some.
Implants. They’re not real.
JOSHI
Tell me one. From when you were a kid.
K
I feel strange sharing a childhood story
considering I was never a child.
JOSHI
Would it help if I told you it was an
order.
She kicks him.

C’mon.

K sits back, a little embarrassed.

K
I had a toy, this wooden horse. An
inscription underneath. All I remember
is a group of boys, big kids, try and
take it away from me. So I run.

Tacky and textured. Trodden vermiculated paths up and down

Capped by the overturned DISH, sections of which have been
cut to let in the light. Like an AMPHITHEATER. Thick
support beams built of reclaimed metals. All to house -A FACTORY. THOUSANDS OF ORPHANS WORKING AWAY. Tiny hands
SIFTING THROUGH TONS OF TRASH brought from the mesas. Mining
it. The bigger kids feed the sorted materials into CARTS
down and away. His private industry.
At the center is the figure of a tall, grandiloquent gelding,
MISTER COTTON. Sole caretaker. A greasy CAPE over broad
shoulders and powerful arms. He SHOUTS at the children.
MISTER COTTON
I’ll put you outside where it’s raining,
raining fire! You’re in here to work.
If you’re not working I don’t need you!
He stops, noticing K.

Grows a salesman’s reptile smile.
CUT TO:

INT. THE SORTING ROOM.
K follows Cotton through a dense section of WORKING, COUGHING
CHILDREN.
MISTER COTTON
No child in my care is ever cold, is ever
hungry -- clothes, blankets. Food, not
the tastiest but warm and enough. I
encourage play, keeps them occupied,
makes them nimble. But it’s work that
molds them into a child worth having.
A TRAY of bottles spills. Cotton suddenly blows A SHRILL
WHISTLE that hangs from a chain around his neck. The BOYS
FREEZE their work. Cotton stares them down. The Boys’ faces
lower in fear and shame. Begin to clean their mistake.
They move through an area dedicated to the sorting of METALS.
Taken from old technology. Sorted and melted down by MUCH
YOUNGER CHILDREN. Many of whom show the desquamated skin and
blackened teeth of metal poisoning.
MISTER COTTON (cont’d)
We find new life for everything
discarded. And every one. The nickel
goes to colonial ships. Closest any of
them will get to the grand life offworld.
Now -- what sort did you have in mind? I
have all kinds.

He blows two short BLASTS of his WHISTLE. Every child in the
arena instantly STOPS WORK, STANDS. FACES THEM. On display.
K sees the sea of hopeful faces.

Shows his BADGE.

K
I’m not buying.
Cotton wheels on K.

Suddenly hackles up and hard boiled.

MISTER COTTON
No. This is my game and I play it fair.
Bigger have tried to shut me down, men at
that.
K gives a hard stare.

Taking in all the KIDS.

K
A little boy came through here, 30 years
back. I need to see your records.
Legitimate placements, private sales.
Everything, in and out.
MISTER COTTON
I don’t keep records that far back.
You don’t.

K
MISTER COTTON
I can’t help you.
Cotton gives a confident, supercilious shrug.

In response...

K CRACKS Cotton in the FACE. SLAMS him to a wall, PULLS his
WHISTLE CHAIN tight. Choking him. In front of THE CHILDREN.
K
I think you can. I think someone like
you keeps a long memory. Minds what he
owes and makes sure he gets paid.
Someone like you keeps it all careful.
You can tell me what you know... or I put
a hole right here and take a look.

K keeps a firm, probably painful grip on Cotton’s shoulder as
they walk through. They reach a split in the path. Cotton
moves on down a set of stairs.
K pauses a moment. Looking around him. A strange and
fleeting feeling of familiarity about his surroundings.
MOMENT OUT OF THE MEMORY HE DESCRIBED EARLIER.

A

MISTER COTTON
You coming?
A pause.

Then K follows, toward --

INT. COTTON’S PRIVATE QUARTERS. TANKER. MOMENTS LATER.
Private quarters to house Cotton and his lavish tastes.
Cotton searches A WALL OF LEDGERS...
Finds the one he’s looking for, pulls it down. We see page
after page of meticulously kept balance sheets. Cratchit
level care and penmanship. As Cotton flips pages...
K scans the room. Notes Cotton’s personal luxuries. More
treasures of secondary use. A rotisserie humidor. A
handcrafted gilt bed.
Cotton locates A DATE in a dusty volume.
Only to find TORN PAGES.

Flips to it...

Surprised, he flips back and forth.

MISTER COTTON
It’s gone. The entire year, it should be
here! It-- wasn’t me -- it wasn’t me -He offers K the book, quailing.

Pathetic supplication.

K sees the missing sheaves. He hears the door SLAM -- Cotton
slipping out. Worming away.
K leaves him to his retreat.

Examines the torn pages.

Someone got in here a long time ago.
K’s eyes find an item in the junk:

Covering tracks.

A HORSE HEAD ASH TRAY

Stuffed with stubs and ash. He turns it. Stares at it.
Something about it tugs at K’s memory, as...

INT. ABANDONED TANKER. THE ORPHANAGE.
K makes his way out. Following the shadowy maze. He turns
towards the light of an OPENING to outside -- when he stops
at the place that caught his eye before.
K changes directions.

Walks downstairs.

He pauses, looks down over a railing, as -INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY. THE ORPHANAGE.
Something about it.

An odd familiarity.

He moves down the passage.

Into the dark.

Takes a turn...

K inside.

Huge to a child.

Small to him now.

He finds A ROW OF FURNACES.

Old, cold, rusted.

He stops before one of them. And freezes. JUST AS HE DID
WHEN A CHILD IN HIS MEMORY. STANDING IN THE SAME SPACE.
He moves to the secret place behind it.
Then steps closer.

Frightened to look.

Moving around behind it, finding...

THE SMALL HINGED GRATE.

The hiding place.

He works up the nerve.

The ancient grate opens with a CREAK.

He reaches in.

Not just figment.

His heart skips as he finds --

AN OLD DUSTY RAG.

K UNWRAPS THE RAG... INSIDE IS...

A SMALL HAND-CARVED TOY. A WOODEN HORSE. FORELEG RAISED.

She sits on the balls of her barefoot feet in the center of

Doctor Ana Stelline?
She sees K and pauses in her work. The room SHIFTS. The
forest disappears to reveal an artist’s studio showing its
colors as a LAB, with equipment sliding into place.
A visitor.

ANA
K
Is that all right?
ANA
Just unusual.
K shows his badge.

Ana gives it a look, intrigued.

thick WINDOW that divides the room, enclosing her.
Ana laughs. A joke.
Ana is easy to like.

She TAPS the GLASS, a puckish streak.

ANA (cont’d)
Sorry. Compromised immune system, a life
of freedom so long as it’s behind glass.
K
I was wondering.
ANA
Why I’m not offworld? My parents had our
passes in pocket, then I took sick. It
was a new life or me, they picked me.
Made my cage and filled it with
everything they could to keep me happy -except company of course, and I was used
to crowds. What can I help you with?
Caught.

But not minding it.

K tries direct.

A

K
Just questions. You might be able to
help me with a case.
Ana considers, amused by the idea.
ANA
That is the most interesting thing I’ve
been offered to help with in ages. Do
you mind if I work while you talk? I
promise I hear every word.
The lights dim. She sits in the middle of her lab and
creates a birthday cake, focuses on the candles. She “puts”
the cake on a TABLE, decorates it. Streamers and treats. A
birthday party. All as -ANA (cont’d)
I loved birthday parties.
She adjusts the ICING on the cake. Then brings in SMILING
FACES OF CHILDREN. Taking special care to craft the microexpressions on each face... joy... wonder... anticipation...
She takes the edges of the IMAGE out of focus, adding Holga
like blurs and imperfections.
K
You make memories, that go into
Replicants. They say you make the best.
ANA
Then they’re kind.
K
You work for Wallace.
ANA
Subcontract. I’m one of his suppliers.
He offered to buy me out, I take my
freedom where I can find it.
K
What makes your memories so... authentic?
ANA
I was locked in an aseptic cloister at
eight. If I wanted to see the world I
had to imagine it. I got very good at
imagining. Wallace needs my talent to
maintain a stable product. “Provide
context for unavoidable affect.” I think
it’s only kind.

ANA (cont'd)
Replicants live such hard lives, made to
do what we’d rather not. I can’t help
your future, but I can give you good
memories to think back on and smile. A
birthday party.
She lights the candles one by one... then brings in a POV
HAND to reach out to the cake... fingers thick with stolen
FROSTING... which is brought towards us in POV to taste... a
tiny, complete, evocative birthday memory vignette.
She steps back to consider it.
Nice.

Pleased with her work.

K
ANA
It’s better than nice. It feel
authentic. If you have authentic
memories, you’ll have real human
responses wouldn’t you agree?
Ana and the kids blow out the candles together and the room
goes completely dark.
K
Are all the memories constructed or do
you ever use ones that are real?
ANA
It’s illegal to use real memories. But
there’s bit of every artist in their
work.
K
How can you tell the difference? Can you
tell if a memory really happened?
Lights turn on as Ana walks towards K. At this Ana faces
him. Her favorite subject merits her full attention.
ANA
Untangling memory and history. They all
think it’s about more detail, dutiful
exactitude, hyberbolic photorealism -that’s not how the memory works. We
recall with our feelings... and our
feelings are awful students. The mind is
an impressionist. Anything real should
be a mess. I can show you.
She offers K a CHAIR built perfectly into the wall by the
glass. Fitted with a chin ledge so a LIGHT can SCAN deep
into the eyes, like an optometrist’s slit lamp. A Stelline
Scan. After its designer.

Now think about the memory you want me to

She works her console. Peers into a MATCHING LIGHT. Seeing

the Scanner translating neural impulse until... A ghost of
an IMAGE takes loose shape... She GRABS it.
A CONNECTION ESTABLISHES WITH A SHOCK.
A MEMORY, LIGHTLY DIGITIZED:

K swimming in the rough ocean
Fear. Salt.

THE CONNECTION ABRUPTLY BREAKS.
A fake.

AS WE SEE --

K rubs his eyes.

ANA (cont’d)
An ugly fake at that.

K
You can tell that quick.
ANA
Stolen straight off the art book shelf.
Detail without mood. Colors are too

K shakes his head.
Lazy work.

K looks up at the angry churning sky. Around him OTHERS

Mariette kisses K.

Steps back.

Ready.

Joi steps up to Mariette. Slow. Close. Her face of light
to her face of flesh. Joi touches Mariette’s face.
K looks to Joi -- What are you doing?
Joi steps forward... stepping into Mariette. Overlaying her
projection ATOP the doxie. So that Mariette is only a shadow
image, encompassed by Joi’s projection... Joi now a thin
layer of light like skin atop Mariette’s real body.
Mariette lifts her hand to take in the effect, which is still
imperfect.
MARIETTE (cont’d)
Look at you.
Quiet now.

JOI
I have to sync.

Joi BRIGHTENS as the sync completes. Mariette’s moves are
now her own. At least for a moment Joi has substance, form.
She moves her body in a delicate sway. A turn. Loving the
effect. Her gift.
She slowly steps up to K.
CLOSE ON:

Joi’s face so close to his.

THE MUSIC PLAYER.

“Summer Winds.”

K isn’t sure how to take this. So Joi raises a hand. K
raises his to meet hers. Recalling their palms pressed
earlier... only now they can truly touch...

He runs a finger over the outline of her face.
and light over a warm, willing body.

Skin of smoke

Joi KISSES him. With real lips. A combination of her static
wisps and true flesh. A perverse threesome. A loving
twosome. K gives in to the moment.

only a shell of debauchery. The hulked MEGASTRUCTURES are
all still there. Dark. Empty. Years of neglect.
In their day they were fever dreams of debauchery. Decades
of sandstorms have scoured away the luster and color. Weeds
grow tall in the cracked streets. A thick DUST coat over it

He carefully steps over.
He continues in. The lobby is long abandoned. A chandelier

The keys open. K taps a KEY. The note rings through the
airy space. Makes the current of floating dust vibrate. At
which K notices -TWO EYES staring at him in the dark -A MANGY DOG
It is, at a glance, the ugliest dog on earth. Flea bitten
and ragged. But a real, live dog. It cocks its head at K.
ON K. Utterly awed by this animal. Homely as it is, it is
miraculous to him. He moves slowly toward it. Hand out.
Hoping to touch it. So lost in the discovery, he is
completely surprised by -- THE CLICK OF A GUN -MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
“You mightn’t happen to have a piece of
cheese about you now, boy?”

Enough to keep us guessing if he’s gone touched left alone

an intruder guessing...
K stares down the blaster.

Takes a gamble.

DECKARD
He reads. That’s good. Me too. Not
much else to do around here at night

As if set free by her acknowledgement, the shadows suddenly

Some listen too. Here we are.

An army

In the shadows are more Replicants... hiding... allied. Her
silent, slithering army. A collection of those awakened to a
dream. We can sense their dissatisfaction like we can their
number. Both vast. The shadow of the coming, violent storm.
FREYSA (cont’d)
Go on. I not so afraid to die. Done
right, dying the most human thing we do.
K lowers the blaster.
K
I found Deckard.

I led Wallace to him.

FREYSA
Don’t pay no mind on that. He always
wanted to die for his own. Never had the
luck. Officer did him a favor.
K can’t live with that.
FREYSA (cont’d)
Deckard only want his baby stay safe.
And she will. I wish I could find her...
I show her unto the world. And she lead
an army!

Her eyes sparkle with the future she sees.
But K is focused only on one word.

He feels it like a bullet.

K
She?
Freysa nods, confused by his confusion on the point.
Course.

FREYSA
Rachael have a daughter.

An infinite beat.

Time shatters.

K shakes his head.

No.

A baby

Gravity upends.

FREYSA (cont’d)
With my own eye. I see her come, I dress
her in blue when time she go.
No.

K
A girl died.

It was a boy you hid.

Freysa shakes her head knowingly.
FREYSA
Just a piece a puzzle.
A wave of nausea rocks K. The crushing realization slowly
taking root... eating away at his new soul...
He was wrong about who he is.

At the moment he sees it.

That’s why we believe.
ON K -- SHAKING -- SHATTERED -- WE MOVE -TO WHITE.
EXT. PEDESTRIAN RAMP. NIGHT.
CLOSE ON K.

BLINDING LIGHT BOUNCES OFF HIM.

He stands in the FLOODLIGHTS, looking up at something
PAINFULLY BRIGHT high and huge in front of him. He is in a
fog. Soultired. No longer connected to physical pain.
REVEAL: ON THE NEXT BUILDING, 30 STORIES HIGH, A 120 FOOT
VERSION OF JOI LOOKS DOWN AT THE CITY. AN ADVERTISEMENT.
LOUNGING RECUMBENT, ELBOW BENT TO PROP HER HEAD.
K is dwarfed by the enormity of her. A man standing before
the sun. He stares up at her like she was a holy site.
“JOI” sees him down below, begins to vamp and twirl. An
interactive ad. Immediately selling. Everything about her a
vulgar exaggeration. Her voice heard above the city din:
“JOI”
Hello, Handsome.

What a day, hmmm?

K looks up to her, eyes full of longing and need. Sees only
the “dead leaf echo” of his Joi. Charmless and generic.
K searches her face for an answer.

Can only see THROUGH it.

“JOI” (cont’d)
You look lonely. I can fix that.
She gives a crass laugh. K stares and stares. Desperate to
find any spark of the woman he loves... praying some part of
her is still in the network, still extant...

101.
“JOI” (cont’d)
Aww...
(leaning down)
You look like a good Joe.
The NAME goes through K like an arrow. Joe? Jo? His mind
fills with doubt and hope and doubt again. Was it all part
of her program? Was she ever real?
No answers from “Joi.” Only a knowing wink and her mannequin
smile as she looks back out on the city. Selling herself to
the world.
CLOSE ON K. His eyes close. As if saying goodbye. To her.
To everything he learned from her to dream and hope for.
His eyes open on the sky as lightning kindles.

And we -CUT TO:

EXT. WALLACE TOWER. NIGHT.
A WALLACE CORP TRANSPORT VAN LIFTS OFF from the platform.
TWO DARK, SLEEK SPINNERS lift off after and follow after.
A moment, then... K’S SPINNER’S LIGHTS COME ON. Waiting in
the wings, barely noticeable. It follows after -EXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT.
THE TRANSPORT VAN flies through the FOG and WET SNOW.
Flanked by THE TWO DARK SPINNERS.

Running along

THE SEPULVEDA SEA WALL
Where the risen ocean meets city. Stretching for MILES.
DENSE FOG spills over like a waterfall.
EXT. ABOVE THE SEA WALL.
The caravan cuts through the thick FOG. Keeps low to the
rough, stormy surface. Sprayed by angry waves.
INT. TRANSPORT VAN.
Condensation streaks the glass. Luv scans the skies around
them. Eyes missing nothing. Satisfied, she fixes her
unblinking eyes on --

102.
DECKARD.

Handcuffed in place.
DECKARD
Where are we going?
LUV
Home.

Deckard’s gaze drifts up... to watch the rain and snow stream
across the glass... a moment’s peace found there before the
pain promised to follow, when -A LIGHT SHIMMERS through he fog.
Then -- visible.

A PILOTFISH.

Barely visible.

COMING FOR THEM FAST --

FLASHING PAST AND VEERING AT THE LAST MOMENT, MISSING THEM -THEN SLAMMING INTO THE SPINNER ESCORT. IT EXPLODES
INSTANTLY! DEBRIS SPARKING AGAINST THE TRANSPORT.
GUN SHOTS WEB THE WINDSHIELD AND KILL THE PILOT.
He slumps, dead.

The CO-PILOT grabs the controls.

Luv stands, searches the sky, as -THE SECOND SPINNER ESCORT TAKES FIRE! Its engine ruptures
and it SPIRALS. AN EXPLOSION QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED BY A FLOOD
OF OCEAN SPILLING OVER AND ENGULFING IT.
Deckard looks out.

Sees --

K’S SPINNER BULLET PAST.

Disappearing into the mist.

Luv quickly assesses the damage.

Orders the Co-Pilot:

LUV (cont’d)
Take us back.
Co-Pilot BANKS the Transport.

When out of nowhere --

WHAM! K’s Spinner SMASHES into them, from underneath.
Disappears in the fog again.
The Transport’s engine fails -- losing altitude -- SMOKE
BILLOWS off as it descends. LUV RAGES.
Co-Pilot fights the controls to level them off -- but cannot
stop their descent. At which they see -THE SEA WALL
It looms large as they drop toward it.

Deckard watches their descent from his seat as -THEY CRASH AT THE BASE OF THE SEA WALL!
WATER rushes over the glass roof.

Co-Pilot works the controls. With effort the Transport
engines come alive, threatening to LIFT, when -WAVES COME SMASHING DOWN OVER THE VEHICLE.
Luv opens the door, drawing her weapon.
BLAM! A BULLET PUNCTURES THE WINDSHIELD.
SNAPS BACK, THEN SLUMPS.

CO-PILOT’S HEAD

DECKARD
Looks up.

Light suddenly streams on his face.

ON K
Backlit and FIRING as he comes.

Heedless of his exposure.

Luv holds her position until -- SHE FIRES AT K -K FIRES -- HITS LUV -- WHO FLIES BACK WITH THE IMPACT.
ON K
Coming for Deckard. Even as Deckard watches the BLOOD
blossom on K’s chest. They meet eyes, when -LUV CHARGES K LIKE A TRAIN. TACKLES HIM. They tumble like
lovers. Luv destroys what’s left of K’s shoulder, when -A CRUSHING WAVE POUNDS THE TRANSPORT AGAINST THE SEA WALL.
WATER FILLS THE VEHICLE.
K AND LUV
Crush together against the shattered roof to spill out onto --

104.
EXT. SEPULVEDA SEA WALL.
K and Luv struggle to their feet, battered by savage waves -the same waves that carry the Transport further out into the
water with each impact.
Luv focuses her rage to a single point: K. She throws
herself atop him. A wild, crazed thing, sent from the pit.
K’s fist connects with, digs into the soft flesh of her
throat with a pulsing, drawn out CRAAAAAAACK.
Luv only grins -- as if proud he found the strength. Then -A KICK to destroy his ribs sends him backwards, as -INT. TRANSPORT VAN.
The Transport LURCHES.

Water floods in.

Deckard struggles to free his still cuffed hand -A colossal wave CRASHES over the Transport, tipping it -EXT. SEPULVEDA SEA WALL.
K and Luv pause to see the Transport carried out to sea -and begin to SINK. Luv wastes no more time.
HER KNIFE SINGS
K dodges it -- blocks it -- grabs it by the blade -- not
seeing -HER SECOND KNIFE
The blade slips out of K’s gut before he felt it go in.
K falls to his knees.
LUV
I’m the best one.
Luv DIVES into the water, toward the Transport and Deckard.

Deckard is up to his neck, held down by the shackle.

LUV PULLS Deckard back up. Faces him in the small pocket of
air remaining. Luv grins like the devil on his birthday.
LUV
Offworld is waiting.
Without a sound...

K rises in the water behind Luv.

GRABS HER BY THE THROAT.
LIFTS HER TO THE SHATTERED ROOF.
THROWS HER INTO THE WATER.
HOLDING UNDERWATER.

HAND CRUSHING HER WINDPIPE AND

LUV FIGHTS HIM WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS.
BUT K JUST TAKES THE PAIN.

TEETH BARED, BLOODY.

DOES NOT LET GO.

INT. UNDERWATER.
ON LUV. She lashes out, wild, feral spasms. Her mouth
working. Unable to find the words to properly hate. One
pupil goes wide. The eye rolls back in its socket, giving a
clear view of the pinprick of color underneath.
AND SHE GOES STILL.
ON LUV.

An air bubble of resignation escapes her lips.

INT. TRANSPORT VAN.
THE CREAK OF METAL ABOUT TO GIVE WAY.
DECKARD IS ENTIRELY UNDERWATER.
K swims to him.

THE WATER LEVEL RISES.

LUNGS AFLAME.

Breaks his retrains.

K and Deckard dive out of the sinking tomb.
IN THE OCEAN.
K and Deckard swim.
A WAVE BATTERS K.
Jo!

Wave and current conspire to drown them.

WE LOSE SIGHT OF HIM IN THE WATER.
DECKARD

Deckard reaches back.

CLASPS K’S HAND.

Helping him back.

THE SURFACE EXPLODES. K GASPS for breath. ANOTHER WAVE
CRASHES them onto the base of THE SEA WALL.

106.
EXT. SEA WALL BASE.
Deckard grabs hold of K before he is swept out into the sea.
They find their footing, their breath. Deckard nods to K.
He’s all right. They look out to see...
THE TRANSPORT VAN SINKS BENEATH THE SURFACE.

GONE.

K and Deckard together, further up the sea wall. Freezing.
But alive. Under the blood orange sky of a new day coming.
They sit. Find their breath.
DECKARD
You should’ve let me die.
K
You did. You drowned in the ocean.
You’re free. Free to meet your daughter.
Tough as he is -- Deckard is overcome with emotion for the
first time in decades. Just hearing the word. Brings
himself to say it.
DECKARD
Daughter...?
Everything he longed for.

In a word.

In time he breathes.

EXT. LAB BUILDING. DAWN.
K’s hand slips into his pocket.
THE WOODEN HORSE.

Takes out...

He holds it out to Deckard.

Deckard sees it. Takes it. Can’t believe it still exists.
Something made for a child he never met all those years ago.
K
All the best memories... are hers...
Deckard stares at him from a place beyond gratitude.

107.

Why?

DECKARD
What am I to you?

K looks at Deckard.

Wanting him to be so many things.

K
Go meet her.
Deckard’s eyes fill of thanks beyond words.

He turns away.

Crosses the snowy field.

TO ANA.

To the building.

ON K. Watching him go. He lets his hand drop from his wound.
A DROP of BLOOD touches the snow.
K’S POV:
ON K.

Deckard grows smaller in the distance.

Fallen in the snow.

A pool of blood spreads and stains the white snow around him,
as we...
MOVE CLOSE ON K’S FACE. His eyes catch something near him
only he sees. A warm FALSE VOICE comes, calming:
JOI (V.O.)
Would you read to me.
Just as she said when we first met her. K smiles at this
ghost of memory. Of course. A thready whisper of his
baseline. Their old favorite.
K (V.O.)
“And blood-black nothingness began to...
spin... a system of cells interlinked...

Deckard walks toward the door.

Halts before entering.

K (V.O.)
...Within... cells interlinked within

The fog recedes, a brief glimpse of true sky before the wool
sweater clouds return.
K (V.O.)

EXT. SNOWY FIELD. DAWN.

Slipping.

Barely audible.

K
...A tall white fountain played...
He looks up at the snowy sky.
And dies.
INT. MEMORY LAB.
Deckard crosses through the door.

Looks in.

Looks up.

Sees Ana in her lab, staring at snow flakes falling from
above. A perfect digital reproduction of what falls outside
falls here onto her hands. She is completely taken with it.
Deckard steps up to the glass that divides the room.
Watching her watch the snow fall.
ANA
Just a moment.

Beautiful, isn’t it.

Ana turns from the digital snow, fading out.
Takes in the strange stranger at her door.
His kind, wounded eyes staring at her.
Meets them with an innocent smile.

Deckard reaches out.
Hand pressed against the glass.

END.
