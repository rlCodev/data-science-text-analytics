best of them!

HOME MOVIES - HARDING FRONT LAWN - DAY 40 YEARS EARLIER
Grainy home movie film. Lavona’s husband Al Harding plays
with 3 year old Tonya. Lavona is disinterested.
LAVONA (V.O.)
Tonya’s my 5th child from husband
number 4. She was always a handful
but I loved her and I guess we
spoiled her. Which is a goddamned
hat trick when you haven’t got shit
your entire life. Still.

2.
LAVONA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I drove her to competitions and
practices. I sewed her all her
costumes.

LAVONA
But to her, her mother’s a monster.

INT. RAWLINSON’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -

DAY

Title card: Diane Rawlinson. Tonya Harding’s coach
DIANE RAWINSON, late 60’s, sits in her well appointed living
room with a studied grace. She’d fit in any Ralph Lauren ad.
DIANE
Generally people either love Tonya
or are not big fans. Like people
either love America or are not big
fans. Tonya was totally American.

8

INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY

8

Title card: Shawn Eckardt. Tonya Harding’s ex-bodyguard.
On a TV screen marked ‘Evidence’ a late 1990’s interview with
SHAWN ECKARDT, obese and delusional. Not a good combination.
SHAWN (V.O.)
Originally Jeff and Tonya wanted to
take out Nancy Kerrigan. Take her
out. I popped up and said there’s
other ways to disable people. So.
You’re welcome.

INT. MARTIN MADDOX’S NEWSROOM OFFICE - DAY

MARTIN MADDOX
I was a reporter for Hard Copy, a
crappy show all the ‘legitimate’
news outlets looked down on- then
became.
He laughs at his own joke.

10

INT. NAIL SALON - DAY - CLOSE ON MODERN DAY JEFF

10

JEFF
At 27 I was the most hated man in
America. Maybe the world- with a
moustache I still can’t apologize
enough for. My name was a verb.
Like, if you bash someone in the
kneecap, you ‘Gillooly’ them...
That was cool though.

11

INT. TONYA’S HOUSE - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY TONYA

11

TONYA
What’s people’s impression of me?
That I’m a real person. That I
didn’ ever apologize for growin’ up
poor or bein’ a red neck which is
what I am. In a sport where the
friggin’ judges want you to be this
old-timey version of what a woman’s
supposed to be. Um. For bein’ the
first U.S. woman to land a triple
axel. So fuck ‘em.

12

INT. PRACTICE ICE RINK - OREGON - DAY

12

A TITLE CARD READS: Portland Oregon. 40 YEARS EARLIER.
Tonya, just 3 1/2, in a home made skating outfit and skates,
stands on the ice with Lavona, who wears sneakers.
They watch DIANE RAWINSON, pretty, perfect, teaching a group of
skaters.
Lavona, puffing on a cigarette, sizes Diane up.
LAVONA
Diane! Lavona Harding. I spoke with
you on the phone.

4.
DIANE
Mrs. HardingLAVONA
Lavona. It’s LavonaDIANE
Sorry. There’s no smoking on the ice.
LAVONA
Oh... I’ll smoke it quietly then. This
here’s my daughter Tonya.
DIANE
Mrs. Harding. I told you onLAVONA
I know what you told me. And it’s
Lavona. Only you never seen her skate.
DIANE
I don’t train beginners.
LAVONA
All she does is talk about skating.
All day, all night. I can’t make
her shut up about it. So it’s
easier puttin’ her on ice if you
know what I mean. We figure with
the right training she can make the
most of her gift. Like Ice Capades
maybe one day or something.
Diane looks down at the little girl.
DIANE
How old are you, honey?
LAVONA
She’s a soft 4.
DIANE
She’s a very pretty girl but I don’t
take on students this young. I’m
sorry. I have a class waiting.
She skates to the center of the ice as students gather round.
Tonya watches her go. Lavona stares bullets at Diane, then nods
purposefully to Tonya.
LAVONA
Go on. Skate.

5.
Tonya skates around the perimeter of the rink. Never taking her
eyes off Diane, she picks up speed.
Diane tries to ignore the little girl but there’s something
about her. And Tonya thrives on the attention.
Finally Dianne stops teaching. She smiles.

13

INT. COMPETITION ICE RINK - OREGON - DAY

13

A line of pagent-y 7 to 9 year old skaters stand in a line as a
trashy 4 year old girl (Tonya) receives a 1st place medal.
TONYA (V.O.)
6 months later I win my first
competition. I was 4. Those bitches
didn’t know what hit ‘em.

14

INT. PRACTICE ICE RINK - OREGON - DAY - 4 YEARS LATER

14

Lavona sits in the bleachers sipping ‘coffee’ from a thermos.
LAVONA
Wrooooong!.. Ordinary. Nothing special
there.
On the ice, Tonya, 8, in an ugly homemade skating outfit,
flounders. Parents sit as far from Lavona as possible.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
Are you even trying. Cause there’s
other places I’d fucking rather be...
Concentrate. Is that what you call a
clean skate, for Christ sake?
SKATER MOM
Could you not swear in front of the
kids please, Lavona?
LAVONA
I didn’t swear, you cunt. (To Tonyatalking to a skater) Stop talking to
her! That girl is your enemy. You’re
not here to make friends.
Tonya and the girl skate toward the exit. Lavona jumps up.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
Where the hell are you going?

6.
TONYA
I have to go to the bathroom.
LAVONA
Don’t tell me what you have to do. I
paid for you to skate. You’re gonna
stay on the ice and skate.
The other girl heads off. Tonya looks toward the bathroom.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
Get over here.
Tonya recognizes the look on her mother’s face. She skates
backward, away from Lavona.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
You’ll have to come off the ice
sometime. Ya hear me? I’ll be right
here waiting.
Tonya knows this is true. She puts all her attention on the ice.
Then she twirls IMPOSSIBLY HIGH, landing perfectly.
Tonya stops suddenly. She drops her head. Urine runs down
Tonya’s leg.
Tonya looks to Lavona who crosses her arms & watches coldly.
Skate wet.

LAVONA (CONT’D)

INT. HARDING HOME - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY LAVONA

LAVONA
To hear her tell it, I would operate
on her daily without anaesthesia. One
fuckin’ time. I hit her one time, with
a hairbrush.

16

INT. PRACTICE RINK - BATHROOM - OREGON - DAY

16

Lavona WHACKS 8 year old Tonya with a hairbrush.
LAVONA
Fucking terrible, scum sucking, loser!
A female skating judge walks in, catching them. Tonya and Lavona
look up at her, caught.

7.
LAVONA (V.O.)
A child sometimes wants to be
corrected.

17

INT. HARDING HOME - DAY

Lavona kicks over a tall chair 8 year old Tonya is sitting in.
LAVONA
Answer me when I talk to you.

Through the car’s BACK WINDOW, we see Lavona slap 8 year old
Tonya across the face.

20

INT. HARDING HOME - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY LAVONA

20

LAVONA
The thing about Tonya was, she skated
better when she was enraged. If there
was no “You can’t do it” type of
thing, she wouldn’t do it.
The bird poops on Lavona’s shoulder. Lavona keeps on talking.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
On the ice, I was there to inspire
her. Off the ice she was a happy, well
adjusted girl.

21

EXT. WOODS - OREGON - MORNING

21

Close on: Tonya, 12ish. She raises a gun MALEVOLENTLY and fires.
BAM!!
A rabbit hops out of the way.

8.
22

EXT. WOODS - OREGON - MOMENTS LATER

22

Tonya and her father AL, 48, walk through the Oregon woods.
Dang!

TONYA
AL
It was a clean shot, Tonnie.
TONYA
I know it. I was aiming for her eyes
like you said. Otherwise I coulda got
her probably.
AL
No sense in shooting a bunny if you
shoot half the meat off her.
TONYA
When I get older I’m gonna work in an
office and have a deadline.
AL
I thought you wanted to do Ice
Capades.
TONYA
I can do both. Yesterday mom made me
wear my skating costume to school. The
red one with the tassels. Everyone
made fun of me.
AL
Why’d she do that?
TONYA
Cause they were taking school pictures
and she said we could use the samples
for competitions. I told mom that
Margie Sussman called us white trash
and mom told me -

23

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
Lavona with Tonya in her yellow skating outfit.
LAVONA
Spit in her milk!!

EXT. WOODS - OREGON - CONTINUOUS

BACK TO: Tonya and Al
AL
I hope you didn’t do that.
Not yet...

TONYA
He takes Tonya’s gun, reloads it.
TONYA (CONT’D)
Do you love her?
AL
I guess. Do you?
...Yeah.

TONYA
AL
Like you love me?
He hands the gun back to her.
Nope.

TONYA
Al nods. She aims. She fires.
A bunny flies backward, dead.

25

INT. PRACTICE ICE RINK - OREGON - DAY

25

A DAINTY SKATER glides gracefully on one leg, arms extended.
Tonya barrels past, a bull in a china shop. She jumps and lands
a triple. She looks to Lavona, standing with Diane.
Lavona ignores her.
LAVONA
What does she need a fucking fur coat
for? I don’t have a fucking fur coat.
DIANE
Because it’s not just skating. The
judges want figure skaters to beLAVONA
Rich, prissy, a-holes-

10.
DIANE
Well rounded. It’s a question of
fitting in.
LAVONA
She’s 12 and she lands fucking
triples. She doesn’t fit in. She
stands out.
DIANE
She stands out because she looks like
she chops wood every morning.
LAVONA
She does chop wood every..?
DIANE
Lavona. You want to work with me a
little? 23 skaters I train so I can
coach Tonya full time.
LAVONA
And I waitress full time to pay for
your coaching.
DIANE
Yes, but she’s not my child.
LAVONA
No she’s mine. And I’m not throwing my
money away so she can fit in with
these little shits. You can dress up a
pig however you want, ya know what I’m
saying?
DIANE
It’s not about fitting in. It’s about
how she’s growing up.
LAVONA
Lick my ass, Diane. She can do a
fucking triple.
And in the background, Tonya does.

26

EXT. HARDING HOME - EVENING

26

Al skins rabbits as Tonya, in skates, dances around the yard.
TONYA (V.O.)
We didn’t have a lotta fun. We never
went to Disneyland or on trips.
(MORE)

11.
TONYA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If I wanted something, I hada come up
with a way to get it.

27

INT. PRACTICE RINK - OREGON - LOBBY AREA - DAY

27

Tonya, in a ratty rabbit fur coat walks past girls also in furs.
SNOOTY GIRL
What kind of a coat is that?
Tonya shoots her the finger.

28

EXT. HARDING HOME - FRONT YARD - DAY

28

Al heads out as Lavona shouts by the front door.
LAVONA
Go on! Get out! I thought you’d never
leave!
Tonya stands with her father by his packed up truck.
I’m sorry.

TONYA
AL
It’s not your fault, Tonnie.
TONYA
Then take me with you.
AL
I’m gonna be working 12 hour night
shifts. I can’t look after you.
TONYA
You could if you want to.
He gets in the truck, starts the motor. She holds onto his arm,
not letting him go.
AL
We’ll talk on the phone. It’ll all
work out.
AL (CONT’D)
You gotta move now, honey.
She takes his hand and pats her head with it.

12.
AL (CONT’D)
Tonnie, please.
Then he pushes her backwards. She stares, dumbfounded.
TONYA
You’re not gonna leave me here...
He stares ahead.
Dad..?

TONYA (CONT’D)
He drives off. She watches his truck till it’s out of sight.
TONYA (CONT’D)
Take me with you!!
Lavona watches silently. Then goes inside and shuts the door.

29

INT. PRACTICE RINK - OREGON - DAY

29

CLOSE ON: The razor sharp edge of Tonya’s skate racing at
ridiculous speed. The sound of blade scraping against ice.
Tonya, 15, (now played by the same actress who plays modern day
Tonya) with short curly hair and braces, prepares for a tricky
jump but another skater crosses nearby. Tonya STOPS, skates over
to the girl.
TONYA
You’re. In. My. Way.
Cowed, the other skater moves aside. Then Tonya JUMPS.
At the other end of the rink, 18 year old JEFF GILLOOLEY watches
at the rail with his friend, SHAWN, 18, obese.
JEFF
Who’s that?
Shawn squints, ketchup from his hotdog falls on his shirt.

30

SPLIT SCREEN: MODERN DAY JEFF & MODERN DAY TONYA.
TONYA
We met in an ice rink where I was
practicing. I was 15. I was there 8
hours a day, skating. I don’t know
what he was doing there.

30

13.
31

INT. PRACTICE RINK - OREGON - DAY

31

Tonya and Jeff chat awkwardly on opposite sides of the rail.
JEFF (V.O.)
I was young. And I had no game
whatsoever.
Jeff, nervous, all thumbs, tries to appear super cool:
JEFF
So... do you like food?
Tonya hesitates, then nods. In the background, Lavona stops
pouring a drink and watches.

32

INT. HARDING HOME - BATHROOM - DAY

32

Tonya uses a curling iron while applying blue eye shadow. Her
stepbrother CHRIS, late 20’s, watches, hand on his crotch.
TONYA (V.O.)
Back then my step-brother Creepy Chris
was living with us. I remember Jeff
and my’s first date cause I had Creepy
Chris arrested earlier that day.
Creepy Chris moves closer, his hands slowly cupping her breasts.
In one quick motion Tonya whirls round, WALLOPING Chris across
the face with the curling iron. He goes down HARD. She beats him
with it.

33

INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY

33

SHAWN
Jeff did consult me regarding
Tonya. He asked me what I thought
and I said, ‘Go for it man.’ Not to
be a bragger or anything but if I
told Jeff, “You could do better,
man’ no one would be talking about
them today.

34

EXT. KING’S BUFFET RESTAURANT - EVENING

34

Jeff jumps out of the car, opens the passenger door for Tonya
who smiles shyly, not used to such treatment.

14.
TONYA (V.O.)
I’ve never been a girly girl. Jeff
was my first date ever... And my
mom came.
Then Lavona barrels out, motioning them to follow her inside.

35

INT. KING’S BUFFET RESTAURANT - EVENING TO NIGHT

35

Lavona, Tonya, Jeff sit at a serve yourself style restaurant.
LAVONA
You a gardener or a flower, John?
Jeff.

JEFF
LAVONA
In a relationship there’s a flower and
there’s a gardener.
Mom-

TONYA
JEFF
Um, I don’t know. I never thoughtLAVONA
I’m a gardener who wants to be a
flower. How fucked am I?
She downs a drink.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
Tonya won’t garden to save her life.
You’re gonna have to do all the
gardening there fella.
Mom!
What??

TONYA
LAVONA
They look at Jeff as if saying, ’See what I put up with?’
Finally:
LAVONA (CONT’D)
You two fuck yet?
Tonya and Jeff pretend they’re anywhere else.

15.
36

EXT. JEFF’S HOME - FRONT YARD - DAY

36

By a fixer-upper home on an unmowed lawn with a plastic deer &
empty beer bottles, Tonya & Jeff work under the hood of his
truck. On it’s radio, 1986 hits play.
TONYA
My dad’s only been laid off a couple
months now so he stopped sending
money. We had plenty of money before.
I have a fur coat and everything.
Yeah?
Otherwise-

JEFF
TONYA
JEFF
(His eyes on the engine)
My family’s poor.
This quiets her. Tonya watches him.
TONYA
You need me to disconnect the plugs
before youKay.

JEFF
She moves closer as they work. Jeff hands her a towel.
TONYA
That’s okay.
She wipes her hands on her pant legs. Jeff smiles.
TONYA (CONT’D)
What’cha gonna do now school’s done?
JEFF
I do this job for the Association For
Retarded Persons. I mean, I’m not a
retarded person. I’m their driver.
Which is cool. My dad was Air Force.
He died when I was young so my college
is paid for. But- I dunno.
TONYA
My parents had me quit school. To
concentrate on skating.

16.
JEFF
It’s like your superpower. It’s
fucking awesome what you can do.
Tonya stops, unused to compliments or being seen that way.
TONYA
So, what? You like me?
JEFF
You are so fuckin’ pretty.
TONYA
No, I’m not!
She looks COMPLETELY BAFFLED as he moves closer. Then:
You are.

TONYA (CONT’D)
Under the open, greasy hood of his truck, they kiss.
TONYA (V.O.)
He was really sweet in the
beginning. He was a good kisser. He
told me he loved me. And I believed
him. But then-

37

INT/EXT. JEFF’S TRUCK - STREET -

Tonya holds Jeff close as they make love for the first time.

Jeff’s truck ROCKS as inside, he and Tonya have sex.

JEFF

INT. HARDING HOME - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Jeff chases Tonya around the house.

46

Tonya, 19, fires a shot gun at Jeff, BAM.
JEFF (V.O.)
Fired a gun at me too.
TONYA
(To the camera, with a smoking gun)
This is bullshit. I never did this.

47

INT. HARDING HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
JEFF (V.O.)
That comes later. We’re still happy
now.
Lavona watches Tonya as they eat white bread sandwiches.
LAVONA
I can see that shiner through your
make up, ya know.
TONYA
I fell on the ice yesterday.
LAVONA
I don’t know, Tonnie. I would never be
with someone who fuckin’ hit me.
TONYA
You hit dad.

47

19.
LAVONA
That’s different.
TONYA
Anyway he said he was sorry.
They each take big bites. Then with their mouths full:
LAVONA
Seriously though. You’re a dumb piece
of shit who thinks she deserves to get
hit.
TONYA
How’d I get that idea?
LAVONA
(Reconsidering)
Maybe he should hit you. Maybe you’ll
learn to keep your big mouth shut.
Sure helps me out.
Tonya leaves the table, puts her dish in the sink.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
I’m supportive of this relationship,
do you hear me?
TONYA
I gotta go to practice.
Hey!!

LAVONA
Tonya freezes.
LAVONA (CONT’D)
Kiss your mother goodbye.
Tonya cautiously approaches Lavona and kisses her. But Lavona
cannot connect.

INT. COMPETITION RINK - LOCKER ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

48

Title card: 12 months later.
A long line of graceful, angelic, delicate girls make up. At the
end of the line, Tonya, in 1980’s ‘PUNK,’ extinguishes a
cigarette butt on her skate blade.

20.
49

INT. COMPETITION RINK - ON THE ICE - 1986 - DAY

49

Tonya performs to ZZ. Top. It’s the first time we really see her
skate and she’s a wow. The judges clearly dislike her music
selection but her skating has a power none of the other skaters
possess. This is no old fashioned ice princess.

50

INT. COMPETITION RINK - THE STANDS - DAY

50

Jeff grimaces as Tonya soars. Shawn licks his fingers, watching
the monitor instead of live. 4 empty seats away, Lavona studies
Tonya. When Tonya finishes, the crowd CHEERS.

51

INT. COMPETITION RINK - SCORING AREA / HALLWAY - DAY

51

Tonya, out of breath, using her asthmas inhaler, waits with
Diane. When her scores come in, the crowd BOOS loudly.
Tonya and Diane quickly gather their things and walk off.
TONYA
They freakin’ hate me. Emily Ann fell
and scored higher.
DIANE
Honey, you’re- different.
TONYA
I’m not dressing like a retarded tooth
fairy. This is bullshit.
DIANE
The judges expect a conventionalTONYA
I don’t want to be conventional!
DIANE
And your scores reflect that.
TONYA
If I did a triple they’d have to give
me my fucking scores.
DIANE
You can’t just do the tripleTONYA
Sometimes I can!

21.
52

52

INT. HARDING HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tonya sits, eating self-consciously. Lavona stands behind her,
uncomfortably close, just glaring at her. Finally:
TONYA
It wasn’t my fault.

LAVONA
Nothing’s ever your fault.

TONYA
I out-skatedLAVONA
You skated like a graceless bull dyke!
I was embarrassed for you.
I’m sorry.

TONYA
LAVONA
Your father’s not paying alimony ya
know. Every penny I make - every penny
- goes to your skating. And you
weren’t even fucking trying.
TONYA
I said I was sorry.
Lavona wallops Tonya across the head from behind.
LAVONA
Don’t talk back to me.
TONYA
Saying I’m sorry’s not talkin back!
LAVONA
That supposed to be smart?!
Outraged, Lavona rails on her even harder. Tonya dodges her.
LAVONA (CONT'D)
You fucking ungrateful-

Stop it!!

TONYA

Lavona throws a glass of milk at Tonya but misses.
LAVONA
Rolling your fucking alien eyes at me
when I’m talking!
I didn’t!

TONYA

22.
LAVONA
You think I like working for you, you
selfish bitch? If you’re sleeping with
that mustache I want you to start
paying rent.
TONYA
You’re crazy!
LAVONA
I’m not paying for you to act like a
whore and live off me for free!
TONYA
Bat shit fuckin’ crazy!

LAVONA (CONT'D)
Ugly fuckin’ whore!

Lavona throws a KNIFE. It lands in Tonya’s arm. They stop.
Tonya looks at the knife in her arm. She pulls it out. She takes
the knife by the handle and slowly approaches Lavona.
When she is in Lavona’s face, she slams the knife on the table.
Then she walks out. Lavona doesn’t move.

Lavona sits quietly drinking as Jeff struggles past with Tonya’s
suitcase.
JEFF (V.O.)
There wasn’t no more talk of air force
or college. I didn’t care. I wanted to
take care of her. To protect her.

23.
Tonya easily marches past with 2 much bigger bags. Lavona and
Tonya don’t speak or say goodbye. Lavona watches them go.

56

INT. JEFF AND TONYA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Tonya stands behind Jeff at the counter. His hands are behind
him on her ass. Her arms are looped through his so it looks like
he’s holding up her costume but it’s her.
TONYA
Think it needs more tulle? I want it
to look pretty. Tulle’s classy right?
JEFF
You think any more bout getting your
high school G.E.D.?
She moves in front of him, examining her costume.
TONYA
I don’t give a red hot shit about that
anymore.
JEFF
I think you should look into it.
TONYA
Maybe a bow in back?... What if I’m
not smart enough?
His hands SLOWLY move to her front. She smiles as she sews.
JEFF
I ever tell you what I was most afraid
of growing up? Ohmys.
TONYA
(As his hands reach her breasts)
Ohmys?
JEFF
You know in The Wizard Of Oz when they
say, ‘Lions and tigers and bears! Oh
my? My brother convinced me Ohmys were
gonna come in the middle of the night
and eat me alive.
TONYA
You were so freakin’ dumb.
JEFF
And I got a high school diploma.

He holds up her costume, now with a big bow on it’s bottom.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Well, you’re gonna get a medal for

Moved, she turns to kiss him. He ROARS a scary Ohmy roar. She
screams. He chases her, grabbing her ass into the bedroom.

it fall to the floor as Jeff and Tonya kiss.
The music changes. Lavona approaches Tonya and straightens
her wedding dress.
LAVONA

Tonya smiles at her mother who takes Tonya by the shoulders.

DODDIE
No woman in the history of U.S. Figure
skating has landed a triple axel. All
those women who came before you. Not 1
of them did it.
Tonya is still.
DODDIE (CONT’D)
The skating association doesn’t think
you can do it. ‘Trashy Tonya’ doesn’t
belong. Your own mother doesn’t think
so. Now show them.
Tonya, focused, enraged, nods. She skates off onto the ice.
Doddie nods to Lavona.

Here now is Tonya Harding. Second

power. Great speed. Great athletic
ability.
She begins skating, spinning in one spot then opening up.

landing backward on her opposite leg.
REAL TIME. There is a moment of silence then DEAFENING SCREAMS
from the crowd.
TV ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
Good girl!!! Isn’t that great!
SLOW MOTION: the realization of what she’s done hits her. She
looks doubtful, stunned, thrilled, disbelieving, elated.
TONYA (V.O.)
It was totally the most awesomest
thing. Cause leading up it you’re
like, ‘”I can’t do it! I can’t. I
can’t.’ BAM! I CAN! All those people
who said I couldn’t make it. Well fuck
you I did! I proved everyone wrong.
Her mouth is open wide in elation. Instead of throwing her arms
back gracefully, she fist pumps.
She performs 2 more HUGE jumps back to back, perfectly.
Oh!... Oh!

TV ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
On the ice, Tonya flies through the air, lands a double axel
goes into a spin & throws her arms up in a triumphant FINISH.

DIANE
You look well.
TONYA
I look like someone who had a way

DIANE
I was being polite.
Diane sits. They both look down the road. Diane smooths her
already smooth skirt.
You okay?

DIANE (CONT’D)
TONYA
Well. My skating career’s over. I have
no savings. I ended up a waitress like
my mom. On the plus side I’m
unskilled.
DIANE
The Olympic committee announced today
the next Olympics are going to be in 2
years instead of 4.

Happy to.

TONYA
I know you don’t like me. But I’m

JUDGE
Tonya... It’s never been entirely
about skating. I’ll deny I ever said
it honey, but you’re just not the
image we want to portray. You’re
representing our country, for goodness
sake. We need to see a wholesome
American family. And you refuse to
play the along.

TONYA
I’m training for the Olympics anyhow.
LAVONA
So what do you want from me? Money?
TONYA
God. I just wanted to see you.
LAVONA
You’re a taker. Every cent I made went
to your skating and you took it. What
do you want?
TONYA
Well this was a stupid fucking idea.
Was anything I ever did good enough
for you?
LAVONA
You were soft.
At 3??

TONYA
LAVONA
And I made you a fighter. You never-

You made me think I skate best when my

You made that true. I don’t want thatLAVONA
You woulda picked it in a heartbeat!
You should be thanking me. Not blaming
me.
TONYA
Did you ever love me? Or anything
even?
Lavona is momentarily thrown. But she recovers quickly. Then:
LAVONA
You think Sonja Henie’s mother loved
her? Poor fuckin’ you. I didn’t stay
home making Apple Brown Bettys. No I
made you champion! Knowing you’d hate
me for it. That’s the sacrifice a
mother makes. I wish I had a mother
like me. Instead of nice. Nice gets
you shit. I didn’t like my mother
either. So what? I gave you a gift.
Tonya stands, faces Lavona. Before she walks away:

Right. I wouldn’t be the first person

exactly prim and proper.
SHAWN
Someone did it to Tonya!
JEFF
It’s my way of saying I love you.
SHAWN
Interesting. Go on.

No, that’s it. I figure I’ll mail

mail letters from here, have it
postmarked from Portland.
No.

TONYA (CONT’D)

honor. I don’t have education. All I

JEFF (V.O.)
All that craziness, everything I’ll
ever be known for, from start to
finish was just a few months. Before I
went to jail, I got up one morning,

INT. NAIL SALON - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY JEFF

231

JEFF
Tonya would never have thought of
calling in a death threat. And I was

the fact that I ruined her career.
Absolutely ruined it.

TONYA (V.O.)
I was the second most known person
behind Bill Clinton in the world.
That meant something. People still
wanted to see me. So I became a
lady boxer. I mean, why not?
Violence was always what I knew
anyway.
BAM! Her opponent slams her with a right to the jaw. Tonya
momentarily see stars. She looks out at the crowd.
An arena of hate where there used to be love. Ugly faces
shouting and booing.

TONYA (V.O.)
America, you know. They want
someone to love but they want
someone to hate. And they want it
easy.
The match continues. Tonya’s face is beaten and battered.
TONYA (V.O.)
But what’s easy? The haters always
say, Tonya just tell the truth. But
there’s no such thing as truth.
It’s bullshit.
