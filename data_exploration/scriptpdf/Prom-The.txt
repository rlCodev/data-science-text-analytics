BLACKNESS. THE OVERTURE BEGINS. SUDDENLY -EXT. BROADWAY -- BALMY SPRING NIGHT
We TILT down from a blazing MARQUEE that reads “ELEANOR! The
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT MUSICAL!” to a purple carpet. A peppy
REPORTER with a microphone holds court with actors dressed in
gowns and tuxedos.
FRANK DILELLA
It’s Frank DiLella with NY1’s
On Stage and we’re here for the
opening night of “Eleanor! -- The
Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,”
starring the incomparable Dee Dee
Allen.
DEE DEE ALLEN turns from another interview. She is glamorous
and a true legend who gave EVERYTHING she has to The Great
White Way.
FRANK DILELLA (CONT'D)
Dee Dee, you’re a Broadway star.
Yes, I am.

DEE DEE

FRANK DILELLA
You have your choice of roles, what
drew you to Eleanor?
DEE DEE
Eleanor Roosevelt was a powerful,
brave, charismatic woman that no
one had ever heard of. Her story
needs to be told. People need to
know it’s possible to change the
world, whether you are a homely
middle-aged first lady, or a
Broadway star.
Dee Dee nods, moves down the line for more press. BARRY
GLICKMAN enters the line talking to another hack.
RED CARPET REPORTER
And here’s Barry Glickman! You were
brilliant as FDR.
BARRY
I know. The moment I first stepped
into FDR’s shoes, and by shoes I
mean wheelchair, I had an epiphany.

"The Prom"

2.
BARRY (CONT'D)
I realized there is no difference
between the President of the United
States and a celebrity. We both
have power. The power to change the
world.
DEE DEE
(to another reporter)
It’s a weighty responsibility.
BARRY
Let’s talk process.

Barry begins to sing and dance down the red carpet, singing
into microphones, mugging for photos, sure of a Tony.
BARRY (CONT'D)
“WHEN I’M IN CHARACTER I GO INSANE,
I STAGGER, I STAMMER, I SOB, I MAKE
THE AUDIENCES FEEL MY PAIN AND IF
THEY DON’T LEAVE DEPRESSED, THEN
I’VE NOT DONE MY JOB...”
He passes Dee Dee, singing now to a reporter
DEE DEE
“EACH TIME I FIND A ROLE LIKE
ELEANOR, THE ARTIST INSIDE OF ME
THRIVES! I PUT ON THAT WIG AND
THOSE PROSTHETIC TEETH, AND KNOW
I’M CHANGING LIVES!”
INT. BROADWAY THEATRE -- NIGHT
A rapt CROWD watches as Dee Dee (in Eleanor teeth and outfit)
overacts her heart out.
DEE DEE
“BY THE TIME I GET TUBERCULOSIS, IN
ACT TWO...”
She coughs. Barry wheels by full of exuberance.
BARRY
“EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD
INSIDE...”
DEE DEE & BARRY
“WILL SHOUT ‘BRAVO!” ON CUE!”
AUDIENCE
(leaping to their feet)
“Bravo!”

"The Prom"

INT. BROADWAY GREEN ROOM -- NIGHT
Dee Dee has changed post show into a glittering jumpsuit and
looks amazing. Well wishers abound. Barry enters as PRESS
AGENT SHELDON stands on a chair.
SHELDON
(reading phone)
The first review is in. The New
Jersey Star Ledger.
There’s a pause while everyone reads their phones.
DEE DEE
Don’t tell me! Unless it’s a rave.
Or if it’s mixed-positive.
BARRY
It says we’re a hit!
EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT
Dee Dee and Barry dance cross the street to Sardi’s as others
follow. The music vamps as they enter and -INT. SARDI'S -- NIGHT
Barry turns to the adoring crowd, standing on a table.
BARRY
“WE’RE A HIT, AND I THINK WE
DESERVE IT...”
DEE DEE
(also on a table)
“THAT’S FOR SURE...”
BARRY
“ALSO IT MEANS THAT THIS TOUR DE
FORCE, WILL NOT BE FORCED TO TOUR.”
Dee Dee turns to the “ELEANOR!” marquee blinking across the
street and perfectly framed through the second floor window.
DEE DEE
(raising a glass)
To Eleanor! May she run for
eternity!
ALL
To Eleanor!
DANCING WAITERS apparently plucked from a revival of “Hello,
Dolly!” appear, lifting and moving Dee Dee and Barry.

"The Prom"

ALL (CONT'D)
“CHEERS TO A SHOW THAT’S SO
INSPIRING, IT’S ALMOST TOO MUCH TO
SIT THROUGH, AND IF WE RUN THAT
MIGHT MEAN ONE MORE THING...”
BARRY
“THAT IN TEN YEARS OR SO, WE’LL DO
ELEANOR TWO!”
DEE DEE
“I CAN PREDICT WHAT THE REVIEWS
WILL SAY, BEFORE THE NEXT NOTICE
ARRIVES, IT’S GROUNDBREAKING...”
ALL
“EARTH-SHAKING...”
BARRY
“LIFE-AFFIRMING...”
ALL
“BREATHTAKING...”
DEE DEE & BARRY
“GUT-WRENCHING...”
ALL
“HEART-ACHING...”
DEE DEE & BARRY
“IN TWO WORDS IT’S...”
ALL
“HIST’RY MAKING!”
DEE DEE & BARRY
“THAT’S WHY EVERY ACTOR STRIVES...
FOR ADULATION, AND COMPENSATION,
THAT COMES FROM NIGHTLY CHANGING
LIVES!”
BARRY
It’s just what we do!

The opening number ENDS. Phones begin dinging. People start
staring at their phones.
SHELDON
The rest of the reviews are coming
in. The Post, Associated Press, The
New York Times.

"The Prom"

5.
BARRY
The New York Times!

The whole room reads in silence.
Wow.

SHELDON

Party goers drift away, still reading the devastating review.
DEE DEE
What’s happening?
SHELDON
Wow. This is not the review you
want when you’ve got shitty advance
sales. This is going to close us.
DEE DEE
Close us? We just opened!
BARRY
What didn’t they like? Was it the
hip hop?
SHELDON
Yes, but not only that.
BARRY
Sheldon, for God’s sake, just read
it.
SHELDON
Okay. Just the highlights: “Barry
Glickman’s FDR might just be the
most insultingly misguided,
offensive, and laughable
performance that this reviewer has
ever had the squirming misfortune
to endure.”
DEE DEE
That’s not so bad.
BARRY
Do her! Do her!
SHELDON
“Watching Dee Dee Allen’s Eleanor
Roosevelt croaking out a heavyhanded message of activism is like
paying an aging drag queen to shove
a syrup-soaked American flag down
my throat.”

"The Prom"

6.
DEE DEE
That is not criticism; it’s a
personal attack!
SHELDON
“If you are considering buying a
ticket to this show, do yourself a
favor; buy a few feet of good heavy
rope instead and then go hang
yourself.”
BARRY
Jesus. Was the show really that
bad?
SHELDON
It’s not the show. It’s you two.
You’re not likable.
What?

BARRY & DEE DEE

SHELDON
We’ve been over this a million
times: nobody likes a narcissist.
Leave it to me. I’ll go try to
change the narrative, once again.
BARRY
So talking about yourself non-stop
suddenly makes you a narcissist? I
hate this world.
Sheldon exits.
DEE DEE
This is terrible. It hurts. It
hurts my heart. Wait, where did
everybody go?
A waiter, TRENT OLIVER approaches Dee Dee.
TRENT
My condolences, Dee Dee. Remember;
you have friends.
DEE DEE
Thank you. Who are you?
TRENT
A friend. Trent Oliver. We did five
shows together.
Dee Dee looks to Barry for help.

"The Prom"

7.
BARRY
Trent. Went to Juilliard? Won’t
shut up about it?
DEE DEE
Oh Trent! Why are you dressed like
a waiter?
TRENT
I’m between gigs. I feel adrift, as
I did in the days before Juilliard.
You see, my passions are fueled by
the power of Lady Theatre and how
she can, with her gentle touch,
sculpt the human soul. But at
Juilliard -BARRY
Mother of God.
TRENT
-- they taught me an actor is still
an actor even when fishing an
earring out of a chocolate
fountain. If I might soliloquize
for a moment...
BARRY
I’m aging. He’s aging me.
TRENT
If you prick me, do I not bleed? If
you do not pay me, do I not still
act? Still, I’ve played Hamlet! And
yet I am known only as “that guy"
on the beloved 90s sitcom “Talk to
the Hand.”

INT. TITLE SEQUENCE -- TALK TO THE HAND -- DAY
Trent turns to us, smiles and looks into camera as a title
announces “And Trent Oliver as Uncle Mark.” He then gives the
“talk to the hand” gesture and laughs uproariously. It’s
awful.
INT. SARDI'S -- NIGHT
TRENT
I question the very meaning of my
existence. Is a life on the stage
really any life at all?
ANGIE, a LEGGY CHORINE approaches with drinks.

"The Prom"

8.

Hey guys.

ANGIE

Dee Dee and Barry welcome the interruption.
Angie!

DEE DEE & BARRY

ANGIE
Sorry your show closed on opening
night. Again.
Thanks.

DEE DEE

ANGIE
Welcome to the world of the
unemployed.
BARRY
I thought you were in “Chicago.”
ANGIE
I just quit. Twenty years in the
chorus and they still wouldn’t let
me play Roxie Hart. You know who
they have playing the role these
days?
Who?

BARRY

ANGIE
Tina Louise. You know, Ginger from
“Gilligan’s Island”?
BARRY
My God. Is she still alive?
ANGIE
Not really, no.
EXT. EDGEWATER, INDIANA -- HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT
Parents and others enter for a PTA gathering.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT
MRS. GREENE bangs the gavel announcing the start of the vote.
MRS. GREENE
Let’s just get to it. All in favor?
Everyone raises their hands.

"The Prom"

9.
MRS. GREENE (CONT'D)
All against?

Not a single hand.
MRS. GREENE (CONT'D)
The motion is passed.
She hits the gavel again, she likes the gavel.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
STEADICAM: Mrs. Greene is followed by a couple of reporters
as she walks to her car.
MRS. GREENE
Look, the PTA has an accepted set
of rules concerning the prom: young
ladies must wear non-revealing
dresses, young men must wear suits
or tuxes, and if a student chooses
to bring a date, that person must
be of the opposite sex.
INDIANA REPORTER
Can’t you just ban this student?
MRS. GREENE
We have been advised that there may
be some legal repercussions if we
prevented this girl from attending.
So although it breaks my heart, we
have no choice: there won’t be a
prom this year. Thank you.
RACK FOCUS. The girl causing all this controversy -- sweet
kind EMMA -- watches leaning against a wall. MR. HAWKINS the
sympathetic principal looks on. We CUT BACK TO:
INT. SARDI’S -- NIGHT (LATER)
The foursome have closed the place down. Several martini
glasses are in front of Dee Dee and Barry; Angie has downed
at least twenty glasses of rose. They ruminate.
DEE DEE
We’re wasting our lives.
ANGIE
It’s true. Oh, well. At least we’re
all in the same boat.

"The Prom"

10.
TRENT
“Misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows.”
(a beat)
It’s from “The Tempest.”
BARRY
Okay. One: shut up. Two: No! I
refuse to give up. We’re still
celebrities. We have power.
TRENT
But The Times has castrated you as
it were.
ANGIE
He wrote you off as “aging
narcissists.”
BARRY
Well, we have to show the world
that we’re not that.
DEE DEE
What, aging?
BARRY
No, narcissists! People who are in
love with themselves.
DEE DEE
I still don’t understand what’s
wrong with that.
BARRY
Wait a minute. I know how we can
still love ourselves, but appear to
be decent human beings. We’ll
become celebrity activists!
Brilliant!

ANGIE

TRENT
That avoids The Times completely!
BARRY
All we need is a cause.
DEE DEE
A cause celebre!

"The Prom"

11.
BARRY
Exactly. Everybody think of some
causes.
TRENT
Um...poverty?
Too big.

BARRY

ANGIE
World hunger?
BARRY
Again. That’s a major thing. I’m
talking about something we can
handle. What’s the biggest problem
in America right now? Go.
ANGIE
Well, I think it’s the electoral
college. It needs to be abolished.
DEE DEE
As an exercise, just assume we
don’t know what it is and explain
it to us.
ANGIE
Well, the electoral college was
created to allow the smaller states
to have power in a Federalist
government. If the amount of
electoral college votes a state’s
received was -BARRY
Oh my God. So bored!
DEE DEE
This is hard.
TRENT
Let’s think of something less
daunting.
DEE DEE
Yes. A little injustice that we can
drive to.
ANGIE
(taking out her phone)
Let me see what’s trending.

ANGIE (CONT'D)
Trump. Trump. Trump. Kanye. Kanye.
Trump. Hey. What about this girl?
What girl?

BARRY

ANGLE, DOWN ON PHONE: A new story about Emma.
ANGIE
It’s all over Twitter. She lives in
a small town called Edgewater,
Indiana. She’s a lesbian and she
wanted to take her girlfriend to
the high school prom and the PTA
went apeshit.
BARRY
They cancelled Prom? How could they
do that?
ON THE PHONE: Mr. Hawkins stands with Emma and addresses the
press corp. It’s LIVE on Twitter. WE INTERCUT:
HAWKINS
The first thing I’m going to do is
contact the Indiana State’s
Attorney. This isn’t about school
rules; this is a civil rights case.
EMMA
What? Seriously?
HAWKINS
I’m betting pressure from the
State’s Attorney will stop these
bigots cold. It better, because
I’ll tell you this much: if word
gets out, people are gonna get mad.
BARRY
This pisses me off!
HAWKINS
Next thing you know, some modern
day Eleanor Roosevelt is going to
march down here and all hell is
going to break loose.
Dee Dee’s ears suddenly go back with urgency.
DEE DEE
We have got to go down there and
raise holy hell!

"The Prom"

13.
BARRY
We are going to be the biggest
thing to happen in Indiana since...
whatever’s happened in Indiana!
TRENT
So this is it? This is our cause?
BARRY
Yes! It checks all the boxes, and
as a bonus it’s gay, which is
something I can relate to! Are you
all with me?
Yes!

TRENT, ANGIE & DEE DEE

DEE DEE
We’ll have a rally. We’ll carry
picket signs!
ANGIE
And make T-shirts!
BARRY
I’ll get Sheldon to tag along. He
can find us a venue.
ANGIE
Wow. Can we really do this?
BARRY
You bet your sweet MILF ass we can.

“WE'RE GONNA PROVE THAT IN THIS DAY
AND AGE, BEING GAY ISN'T A CRIME,
THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO CHANGE THE

“AND KNOW YOU’RE TRULY CHANGING
LIVES...”
DEE DEE
Oh! We’ll need an anthem.
ANGIE
Like “We Are The World.”
BARRY
Yeah. But about being an angry
lesbian.
TRENT
Stephen Sondheim will write
something for us. He’s a huge fan
of my Sweeney Todd. Leave it to me.
ANGIE
Wait! How will we get there?
TRENT
I just booked a non-equity tour of
“Godspell” that goes through
Indiana. You can join us on the

You see? It’s all coming together!

"The Prom"

16.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
A bell rings. The students of James Madison High pour into
the halls on the way to their lockers and to their next
class. Emma emerges from the crowd. STUDENTS purposely bump
into her as they pass her. Emma makes it to her locker. She
opens it. A pink teddy bear swings out of it. “LEZBO” is
written inside.
EMMA
Nice.
(to the students)
This would be a death threat, I
guess. Way to take the high road,
guys.
Two girls, KAYLEE and SHELBY, walk up behind her. ALYSSA, an
intelligent looking girl, lingers behind them.
KAYLEE
Do you like the bear?
EMMA
Yeah. You know, I’m pretty sure
this breaks a few laws. Violating
my privacy, threatening my life...
KAYLEE
It’s our way of saying “thank you,
Emma.”
SHELBY
Thank you so much for cancelling
Prom.
EMMA
I didn’t cancel Prom, your parents
did!
ALYSSA
Come on, guys. Lay off her.
KAYLEE
Oh, are you on her side?
ALYSSA
No. I’m just not in third grade.
Let’s go.
SHELBY
Unlike your social life, this is
not over.

"The Prom"

17.

They go. Alyssa gives Emma an apologetic look as she goes. As
Emma walks and sings -EMMA
“NOTE TO SELF, DON'T BE GAY IN
INDIANA, BIG HEADS-UP, THAT’S A
REALLY STUPID PLAN. THERE ARE
PLACES WHERE IT'S IN TO BE OUT,
MAYBE SAN FRANCISCO OR THEREABOUT,
BUT IN INDIANA WITHOUT A DOUBT, IF
YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT THEN GUESS
WHAT’S BOUND TO HIT THE FAN?”
INT. HIGH SCHOOL INDOOR POOL -- DAY
Emma dives with FOUR OTHER GIRLS. We follow her UNDERWATER.
As she surfaces and gasps for oxygen -EMMA
“JUST BREATHE, EMMA, NOT EVERYONE
IS THAT REPRESSED, JUST BREATHE,
EMMA, IT WOULDN’T BE HIGH SCHOOL
WITHOUT A TEST, JUST CLOSE YOUR
EYES AND COUNT TO TEN, GO TO YOUR
HAPPY PLACE AND THEN TRY NOT TO
COMBUST, JUST BREATHE...”
NICK & KEVIN in Speedos accost her as she exits the pool,
shivering and wrapping a towel around herself.
NICK
Hey, Emma, who is this girl you
were going to bring to Prom anyway?
I didn’t know we had more than one
lesbo in town.
EMMA
You don’t know her. She’s new here.
KEVIN
Like an exchange student?
Maybe.

EMMA

NICK
Well, then, why don’t you, like,
exchange her for a guy?
KEVIN
Dude. Nice!
Nick and Kevin exit. She pulls off her swim cap, furious.

"The Prom"

18.
EMMA
“NOTE TO SELF, PEOPLE SUCK IN
INDIANA, LEAVE TODAY, PRAY THE
GREYHOUND ISN’T FULL.”

INT. GYM -- DAY
Emma navigates a game of dodgeball. MEAN GIRLS abound
including Shelby and Kaylee. SLOW MOTION of their MEAN
TWISTED faces as they aim at Emma.
EMMA
“WHO KNEW ASKING OUT A GIRL TO THE
PROM, WOULD GO OVER JUST LIKE AN
ATOM BOMB, AND MAKE THINGS MUCH
WORSE WITH YOUR DAD AND MOM, AND
WHO'D HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT COULD
BE POSSIBLE? JUST BREATHE, EMMA,
PICTURE A BEACH WITH GOLDEN SAND,
JUST BREATHE, EMMA, PICTURE A XANAX
IN YOUR HAND...”
Emma grabs a ball, done with the bullying, and THROWS IT
right at Shelby’s face. Off Shelby’s surprise -INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY
Emma heads for another class.
EMMA
“TRY JOURNALING OR START A BLOG,
JUST END THIS INNER MONOLOGUE,
SEETHE IF YOU MUST, BUT JUST
BREATHE...”
Emma heads into class. Hawkins appears, interrupting her.
HAWKINS
Okay. I just got off the phone with
the State’s Attorney. Like I
suspected, she thinks this is a
civil rights issue. This is a big
deal, Emma.
EMMA
So what are you saying: I’m a gay,
white Rosa Parks?
HAWKINS
No. I am absolutely not saying
that. I’m just saying that I’m
excited to be involved with
something like this. And I’m really
glad you’re not on Meth.

"The Prom"

19.

What?

EMMA

HAWKINS
I got a friend who’s a principal in
Chattanooga, all he deals with is
Meth. Meth all day long.
EMMA
Well, I’m not on Meth. Not yet.
We’ll see how the PTA meeting goes.
HAWKINS
It’s not going to be fun. We’ll get
through it. Take a sec. Relax. Come
in when you’re ready.
Hawkins exits.
INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Emma enters a classroom, where the kids are being unruly. She
sits and looks out the window wistfully.
EMMA
“JUST BREATHE, EMMA, REMEMBER THAT
THING CALLED OXYGEN, JUST BREATHE,
EMMA, LOOK AT THE CRAZY STATE
YOU’RE IN...JUST SMILE AND NOD,
ALTHOUGH THEY’RE JERKS, SAY NAMASTE
AND PRAY IT WORKS, AND LIKE WE’VE
DISCUSSED, JUST BREATHE.”
INT. BUS -- DAY
A rented bus makes its way to Indiana. It’s a loud,
unpleasant ride. Trent sits with a bag in his lap, looking
green. The Godspell kids are busy making picket signs. They
sing while they work; an awkwardly harmonized version of Day
By Day. Barry sits with Angie, who is struggling to make a
phone call, and Dee Dee who is shifting uncomfortably in her
seat. Barry is trying to block out the music.
BARRY
Okay enough! Stop singing!
I’m sorry, but you’re making me
hate god! And those signs are
pathetic. We’re not teamsters,
we’re the gay cavalry! Put some
glitter on them, for Christ’s sake!
Angie, who has finished her phone call, turns to Barry.

"The Prom"

20.
ANGIE
You’re scaring them.
BARRY
Well they’re scaring me.
ANGIE
(to the kids)
Just sing something else. Less
gratingly. Thanks.

Barry slumps back into his seat. The Godspell kids rehearse
the harmonies in Save the People, more softly this time.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
The hotel is booked. Breakfast
isn’t included, but there’s
something called a “Waffle Shed”
across the street.
BARRY
Sounds delicious.
Dee Dee pulls out a mink blanket, snuggles into it. She gives
him a look. He notices.
BARRY (CONT'D)
I don’t like school buses. Bad
associations.
DEE DEE
Cheer up. We are doing something
great here. We are being great
people. This is all great.
This is going to get me my third
Tony Award...
(off his raised eyebrow)
You know how the Tonys work: it’s
all politics. They don’t vote for
you, they vote for your brand. My
brand is tarnished, as you know -BARRY
Because of the infamous tirade at
the Longacre Theater.
DEE DEE
When a cell phone goes off in the
middle of a performance I can’t be
held responsible -BARRY
It was your cell phone.

"The Prom"

21.
DEE DEE
I didn’t know it at the time!
Anyway, all the good will we will
get from this thing will wash me
clean. I’ll win no matter what my
next project is.
BARRY
You’re just greedy. I would be
happy with one Tony. I thought I
had a shot with FDR. I need
something to go right for once. The
show is dead, my love life’s
deader...
DEE DEE
What happened to Andre?
BARRY
Andy. Much like the show he’s
performing in, his heart is Frozen.
I caught him making out with the
guy who sells t-shirts in the St.
James lobby. The goddamn t-shirt
guy!
DEE DEE
That’s disgusting.
I know!

BARRY

DEE DEE
I mean Trent. He’s puking again.
Sorry, you were saying?
BARRY
I need a win. I’m so sick of all of
the rejection. I’m no Dee Dee
Allen. They don’t write Tony worthy
roles for chubby, short guys. You
know how not fun it is to be
surrounded by chorus boys with 0
percent body fat and abs that could
grate cheese? They eat what they
want, screw like rabbits. I hate
them.
DEE DEE
A lot of bile.
BARRY
Well, I’m angry at life.

"The Prom"

22.
DEE DEE
No, Trent again. He’s retching...
Sorry, go on.
BARRY
I went into this business because I
loved it, yes, but also to prove to
everyone who doubted me -- my
teachers, the kids on the school
bus, my horrible parents -- that I
could do something important.
DEE DEE
That’s exactly what we’re doing:
something important.
BARRY
Yes. I just hope we don’t screw it
up.

Dee Dee considers this. They both sigh. The Godspell kids
dive into Day By Day with gusto as Barry dies a little.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
We are in a raucous PTA meeting.
MRS. GREENE
You’re telling us that the State’s
Attorney is forcing us to hold a
prom?
HAWKINS
The State’s Attorney wants us to
hold an inclusive prom, yes,
because that’s what they feel best
reflects America’s values.
MRS. GREENE
This is not America. This is
Indiana.
HAWKINS
Just to be clear, this is America.
PARENT #1
My son will not be forced to go to
a homosexual prom.
HAWKINS
Again, it’s not a homosexual prom;
it’s an inclusive prom and you
don’t have to attend if you don’t
want to.

"The Prom"

23.
HAWKINS (CONT'D)
Look I’m sorry you’re upset, but
the organization of the prom is
within the purview of the Student
Council. Let’s hear what they have
to say. Alyssa?
ALYSSA
Well, we want Prom to go on,
obviously. It’s supposed to be a
celebration, for all students -MRS. GREENE
This is not a student matter. This
is about government tearing our
community apart. This is big
government taking away our freedom
of choice.
HAWKINS
Okay. This is not about government
intervention. Emma? What is this
about?
EMMA
I just want to go to Prom like any
other kid.
HAWKINS
But you can’t. And that’s why the
courts are involved. Now I know the
unfamiliar can be frightening, but
the fact is a young girl at this
school -- an honor student -- stood
up and asked us all to take a
closer look at our beliefs. So,
let’s do that. Ask yourself exactly
what is it that you find so
frightening about homosexuals?

At that very moment, the doors to the gym burst open and
Barry, Trent, Angie & Sheldon and the Godspell Group rush in,
picket signs in hand.
BARRY
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! What you
are doing is wrong!
Everyone is shocked.
MRS. GREENE
Excuse me...who are you?

BARRY
(to Mrs. Greene)
Seriously? I’m Broadway’s Barry
Glickman! Where’s the lesbian kid?
(Emma raises her hand)
Hi, I’m Barry. What’s your name?
Emma.

EMMA

Barry hugs her.
BARRY
Emma! Don’t you worry, Emma. You’re
not alone! I’m as gay as a bucket
of wigs -(the crowd gasps)
A bucket of them! And I have come
all the way from New York City to
save you! Tomorrow we’re going to
have a rally! There’s going to be
banners! Choreography -HAWKINS
Excuse me -BARRY
Shame! Shame on you!
(pointing to the parents)
Shame!
BARRY, ANGIE & TRENT
Shame! Shame! Shame! Etc.
MRS. GREENE
What is going on? Who are you
people?
TRENT
We’re liberals from Broadway.
ANGIE
And we’ve come to pry open your
tiny little minds! You see, the
five of us...
(notices Dee Dee is
missing)
Wait, where the hell is Dee Dee?
Dee Dee makes a dramatic entrance and strides across the
stage, stopping at the podium.

"The Prom"

25.
HAWKINS
(recognizing Dee Dee)
Oh my God! You’re Dee Dee Allen.
DEE DEE
You bet your ass I am.
HAWKINS
What...What are you doing here?
DEE DEE
I am changing the world.
(shooing him away)
Excuse me.
(then)
“I WANT TO TELL THE PEOPLE OF
WHATEVER THIS TOWN'S CALLED,
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
AND FRANKLY I'M APPALLED...”
“I READ THREE-QUARTERS OF A NEWS
STORY, AND KNEW I HAD TO COME,
UNLESS I'M DOING “THE MIRACLE
WORKER,” I WON'T PLAY BLIND, DEAF
AND DUMB!”
“LISTEN YOU BIGOTED MONSTERS, JUST
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOUR
PREJUDICE AND YOUR OPPRESSION
WON'T GET PAST THIS BROADWAY STAR.
STEALING THE RIGHTS OF A GIRL
WHO IS AN L.G.B.Q. TEEN, I’VE BEEN
FAR TOO ANGRY TO GOOGLE WHAT THOSE
LETTERS MEAN. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT
ME, IT'S ABOUT POOR...”
“Emma...”

BARRY, TRENT, SHELDON & ANGIE

DEE DEE
“FOR CAN'T YOU SEE, THE RAW DEAL
SHE'S BEEN DEALT? SO HEAR MY PLEA,
OR HERE'S YOUR NEXT DILEMMA, HOW DO
YOU SILENCE A WOMAN WHO'S KNOWN FOR
HER BELT?”
BARRY
Sing it, Eleanor!
DEE DEE
“HER BELT! BUT IT’S NOT ABOUT
ME...”

"The Prom"

26.
MRS. GREENE
Get them out of here! Now!
DEE DEE
“GO ON AND THREATEN TO RIOT, IT
WON’T FAZE ME IN THE LEAST, I
UNDERSTAND FURIOUS TOWNFOLK, I DID
“BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. I'M NO
STRANGER TO SLANDER SO, MY DEAR,
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, THE POST ONCE
SAID I WAS TOO OLD TO PLAY EVA
PERON, EVA PERON! BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT ME, IT'S EMMA'S STORY, DAMN
IT! EQUALITY SHOULD BE THIS
COUNTRY'S NORM TO A PICTURE TAKER.
NO PHOTOGRAPHY UNLESS YOU INSTAGRAM
IT, USE HASHTAG DEE DEE TAKES LOCAL
YOKELS BY STORM, BUT IT’S NOT ABOUT
ME. I DIDN’T COME HERE TO MAKE A
SCENE, BUT I KNOW HOW EMMA'S HEART
ACHES, AND THIS IS HOW ACTORS
INTERVENE, THROUGH FIERY SONGS AND
DANCE BREAKS!”

Dee Dee does a fiery dance break. Barry and Angie join her.
Trent plays the cowbell. The crowd watches in horror.
DEE DEE (CONT'D)
“BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, ALTHOUGH
I'M RICH AND FAMOUS. PUBLICITY IS
NOT MY FINAL GOAL...”
STUDENTS & PARENTS
“CALL SECURITY!”
DEE DEE
“YOU NEEDN'T BE SOME BACKWOODS
IGNORAMUS, JOIN ME AND WE'LL START
FIGHTING. COULD I GET SOFTER
LIGHTING? WAIT, THIS...”
(thanking the lighting
person)
Thanks!
(Back to singing.)
“IS NOT...”
BARRY, ANGIE, SHELDON & TRENT
“NOT, NOT, NOT...”
DEE DEE
“ABOUT ME...”
BARRY, ANGIE, SHELDON & TRENT
“THIS IS NOT ABOUT...”

"The Prom"

27.
ENSEMBLE
“WHAT IS HAPPENING?”
BARRY, ANGIE, SHELDON & TRENT
“THIS IS NOT ABOUT...”
ENSEMBLE
“WHAT IS HAPPENING?”
BARRY, ANGIE & TRENT
“THIS IS NOT ABOUT...”
DEE DEE
“IT’S ALL ABOUT EMMA AND NOT ABOUT
ME!”

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
The gym empties out. Mrs. Greene exits yelling at Hawkins.
MRS. GREENE
Who was responsible for that? Was
it you?
HAWKINS
Me? No! I have no idea what just
happened in there.
MRS. GREENE
Strangers burst in hurling insults
at the parents, and you do nothing?
What kind of a school are you
running here, Mr. Hawkins?
Mrs. Greene leaves. Dee Dee emerges.
HAWKINS
Excuse me. Miss Allen, may I speak
to you for a moment? I’m Tom. Tom
Hawkins. I’m the principal. I
just...uh, what are you doing here?
DEE DEE
We have come to show this community
that gay people and gay-positive
icons like myself are made of the
same flesh and blood as they are.
We’re not monsters.
BARRY
(emerging, to a parent)
And I’ll tell you something else.
I’m half Jewish too! The Poppas!
The Poppas!

"The Prom"

28.

The parent runs off with Barry following.
HAWKINS
Well...this is not the way to do
it. I almost had those parents
convinced to reinstate Prom and you
disrupted everything.
DEE DEE
Well, that’s exactly what we came
here to do.
Dee Dee starts to leave.
I’m a fan.

HAWKINS

DEE DEE
What? You’re a fan?
Yes. I am.

HAWKINS

DEE DEE
What kind of fan? A big fan, or a
small fan, or a scary, stabby
fan...?
HAWKINS
You could say I’m a big fan, yes.
DEE DEE
Really? That’s surprising. You’re
not my usual demographic.
HAWKINS
You mean black?
DEE DEE
No. Straight. You are straight,
right?
HAWKINS
I am. Straight people like Broadway
too.
DEE DEE
You know I’ve heard that, but I
always thought it was a fairytale.
So to speak.

"The Prom"

29.
HAWKINS
Well, it’s true. I’ve been a fan
since I saw you in the show for
which you won your first Tony.
DEE DEE
You saw “Swallow The Moon”?
HAWKINS
Sure. That song you sing at the top
of the second act: “The Lady’s
Improving”? Chills.
DEE DEE
That song made me a star.
HAWKINS
And it made me a fan.

Trent and Sheldon reappear.
TRENT
Dee Dee, we must make haste.
SHELDON
Some of the larger inbreds are
trying to tip over the bus.
Trent and Sheldon leave. Dee Dee starts to follow but -HAWKINS
Miss Allen. This is a delicate
situation. I’m asking you and your
friends to back off for a few days.
DEE DEE
Back off? Backing off is exactly
what we’re not going to do. I see
what’s happening here. You’re
trying to disarm me with flattery.
Well it won’t work, Tom. Flattery
only makes me stronger. It fuels my
ego.
Dee Dee exits as Emma enters, followed by Angie who is
frantically taking pictures with her phone.
EMMA
Stop taking my picture!
ANGIE
We need a poster for the rally.
Angie takes the photo. Leaves.

"The Prom"

30.
EMMA
Who are these people?
HAWKINS
Actors. Famous Broadway actors.
They’ve come to help you.
EMMA
Well, they’re not helping me! This
is a nightmare!
HAWKINS
Oh, it’s not a nightmare. You can
wake up from a nightmare. I’ve got
to go deal with the riot in the
parking lot.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- BLEACHERS -- NIGHT
Alyssa runs up to Emma, here for a forbidden clandestine
meeting.
Oh my God.
I know.

ALYSSA
EMMA

ALYSSA
It’s like everybody’s gone insane.
I’m freaking out.
EMMA
Don’t freak out. We have a plan,
remember? We get dressed up, go to
Prom and be together, in public.
Not hide anymore.
ALYSSA
I don’t know. My mother’s going
ballistic. I’ve gotta go. I told
her I was just coming back for my
books.
EMMA
This is not my fault, you know
that, right?
(then)
“I DON'T WANT TO START A RIOT, I
DON'T WANT TO BLAZE A TRAIL, I
DON'T WANT TO BE A SYMBOL, OR
CAUTIONARY TALE...
(MORE)

"The Prom"

31.
EMMA (CONT'D)
I DON'T WANT TO BE A SCAPEGOAT, FOR
PEOPLE TO OPPOSE, WHAT I WANT IS
SIMPLE, AS FAR AS WANTING GOES. I
JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU, LET THE
WHOLE WORLD MELT AWAY, AND DANCE
WITH YOU, WHO CARES WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE SAY, AND WHEN WE'RE THROUGH,
NO ONE CAN CONVINCE US WE WERE
WRONG, ALL IT TAKES IS YOU AND ME,
AND A SONG...”

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- FOOTBALL FIELD -- NIGHT
The big STADIUM LIGHTS THUMP ON, revealing the girls walking
together down the center line as football players play around
them. It’s magical and fantastical.
ALYSSA
“I DON'T NEED A BIG PRODUCTION,
STREAMERS HANGING IN THE AIR, I
DON'T NEED TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH
CONFETTI IN MY HAIR, I DON'T NEED A
ROOM OF PEOPLE THAT I DON'T REALLY
KNOW...”
EMMA
“I JUST WANT TO HOLD YOU...”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“AND NEVER LET YOU GO...”
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
EMMA & ALYSSA
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU, LET
THE WHOLE WORLD MELT AWAY, AND
DANCE WITH YOU, WHO CARES WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE SAY, AND WHEN WE'RE
THROUGH...”
EMMA
“NO ONE CAN CONVINCE US WE WERE
WRONG...”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“ALL IT TAKES IS YOU AND ME
AND A SONG...”
Mrs. Greene appears.
MRS. GREENE
Alyssa. What are you doing?

"The Prom"

32.

Nothing.

ALYSSA

MRS. GREENE
Get in the car. Now!
Alyssa runs off. Mrs. Greene stares at Emma for a moment,
then follows Alyssa off. Emma is alone. She sings to herself.
EMMA
“TWO PEOPLE SWAYING SLOWLY, NOTHING
MORE AND NOTHING LESS, WHY ANYBODY
FEARS THAT, IS ANYBODY'S GUESS...”
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU, LET
THE WHOLE WORLD MELT AWAY, AND
DANCE WITH YOU, WHO CARES WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE SAY, AND WHEN WE'RE
THROUGH, NO ONE CAN CONVINCE US WE
WERE WRONG, ALL IT TAKES IS YOU AND
ME AND A SONG!”
EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)
The Godspell bus pulls in.
INT. MOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT
The lobby of an unpretentious town motel. A CLERK stands
behind the counter. The doors burst in and the Broadway
contingent arrives: Dee Dee and Angie first.
DEE DEE
Oh my God. This is worse than the
bus.
ANGIE
Well, at least it’s quieter. If I
had to sit through “Day by Day” one
more time, I would have killed them
all one by one.
(to the clerk)
4 rooms under Dickinson. I called
yesterday.
DEE DEE
4 rooms of varying sizes to reflect
the hierarchy of the company,
correct? Where’s my suite?
CLERK
We don’t have a suite...

"The Prom"

33.

She reaches into her bag, pulls out a Tony award, and smacks
it on the counter.
DEE DEE
Do you have a suite now?
CLERK
Uh...no we don’t have any suites.
All the rooms are the same.
DEE DEE
Surely you know who I am. At the
very least I want a room close to
the spa.
Uh...

CLERK

Dee Dee reaches into her bag and slams another Tony award
onto the counter.
CLERK (CONT'D)
There is no spa. We have a foosball
table. I could put you near that...
Barry enters.
BARRY
Angie, have you seen these rooms?
We’re all going to be murdered and
stuffed, you know that right?
ANGIE
Orbitz gave this place three stars.
She takes a small bottle of liquor from her bag, drinks it.
BARRY
Do you have any cabins?
CLERK
Uh, we don’t have any cabins...
Barry reaches in his bag and pulls out an award and slaps it
on the counter.
BARRY
How about now?
DEE DEE
What is that?
BARRY
Drama Desk. You know what it is!

"The Prom"

34.
TRENT
I vomited in the bus again.
(approaching the counter)
May I speak with the hotel doctor?
BARRY
Hotel doctor? Trent, if there’s a
doctor here he’s in the basement
sewing the guests together into a
giant human centipede.
CLERK
(to Trent)
Oh my God! It’s you! I can’t
believe it’s really you!
BARRY
Wait, you know him, but you don’t
know us?!
TRENT
I suppose my artistry speaks for
itself.
CLERK
You’re that guy from “Talk to the
Hand”! That’s on every night at 9
after “Two of a Kind”!
TRENT
I’d like my room now, please.

The clerk hands him his key.
BARRY
Okay. Let’s get started! Let’s
change some minds! Sheldon’s
working on the venue.
(to Trent)
What about the song? It’s not too
Sondheim-y, is it?
TRENT
About that. Apparently I was misled
by my representation. Mr. Sondheim
is not a huge fan of my Sweeney
Todd. Quite the opposite actually.
The man has a lot of anger in him.
Very clever anger.
DEE DEE
Jesus, Trent. You screwed us! We
can’t have a rally without an
anthem!

"The Prom"

35.
TRENT
Don’t worry. I wrote something
myself. It’s quite rousing and is
in a very humane key.
(Trent hands out sheet
music to everyone)
The Godspell cast will back us up.
They have their own costumes.

They all take a moment to read the music in silence. Then -Oh my God.

ANGIE

BARRY
This is awful.
DEE DEE
You rhymed “bigotry” with “big of
me.”
TRENT
Pretty great, huh? Take that LinManuel Miranda.
BARRY
We can’t do this! They’ll throw
beer cans at our heads!
TRENT
No, trust me. All we need is a
simple message that tugs at the
heartstrings and a little
pageantry. We have everything we
need right here.
ANGIE
Except a venue.
Sheldon enters.
SHELDON
Oh ye of little faith! I got one! I
had to get down on my knees a few
times, but it was worth it. Good
sound system. Good sight lines and
a crowd of 2500 guaranteed!
DEE DEE
That’s amazing!
TRENT
What is it? One of those beautiful
antebellum opera houses?

"The Prom"

36.
SHELDON
No, it’s an arena! You’re the
halftime show at something called
“a monster truck rally.”

As the lights go down we hear the roar of monster trucks.
INT. MONSTER TRUCK RALLY -- DAY
Halftime at the packed monster truck rally. A massive stadium
crowd eats jerky and clutch huge cups of soda. STAGE HANDS
put finishing touches on a makeshift, very cheap looking
stage plopped in the middle of the arena.
MONSTER TRUCK ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen! Truckosaurus,
the car-eating robot dinosaur, will
not be your halftime entertainment
today. Instead we have some guests
who have come from New York to sing
us a song about intolerance.
Trent walks to the center of the stage. The music begins over
his intro.
TRENT
Hello, I’m Trent Oliver; actor. And
Juilliard graduate.
MAN (OFFSTAGE)
Hey! It’s that guy from “Talk to
the Hand!”
The crowd roars.
TRENT
You know, “Talk to the Hand” is
just a small part of my resume. In
the early aughts, I had an arc on
“Grey’s Anatomy” in which I played
Dr. Julio Rodriguez, a handsome
Hispanic heart surgeon, whose
growing cocaine addiction threatens
both his personal and professional
life. When preparing for the role,
I realized something about people.
I realized that even though we are
all different on the outside,
inside we are all the same. And it
occurred to me that if we could
just accept our collective
sameness, the world would be a much
nicer place. That’s why I wrote
this song.

"The Prom"

37.

A giant poster of Emma is revealed. It is the photo that
Angie took after the PTA meeting. It is not flattering.
TRENT (CONT'D)
This is for you, Emma. “FLOWERS
ACCEPT THE RAIN AND GROW MORE
BEAUTIFUL, BABIES ACCEPT THEIR
MOTHER'S BREAST SO THEY CAN GROW
STRONG, I ACCEPT THAT I WAS BORN A
HANDSOME MAN, SO JOIN WITH ME AND
SING THIS ACCEPTANCE SONG...”
The Godspell cast ENTERS, backing Trent up.
ALL
“LET US ACCEPT ONE ANOTHER...”
TRENT
“I KNOW IT’S TRULY HARD...”
ALL
“WE’RE SISTER AND BROTHER...”
TRENT
“HERE’S WHAT I LEARNED AT
JUILLIARD: BIGOTRY'S NOT BIG OF ME,
AND IT'S NOT BIG OF YOU...”
ALL
“LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER, TO MAKE
RAINBOW DREAMS COME TRUE...”
TRENT
Ladies and Gentlemen, two time Tony
Award Winner, Mrs. Dee Dee Allen.
Dee Dee enters.
DEE DEE
“ACORNS ACCEPT THE SUN AND TURN TO
MIGHTY OAKS, SPERM WHALES ACCEPT
FRESH SEA AIR THROUGH THEIR
BLOWHOLE THINGS...”
TRENT
“BLOWHOLE, BUMBLEBEES ACCEPT
THEY'LL DIE WITHIN A YEAR...”
TRENT & DEE DEE
“AND STILL THEY FLAP THEIR SOON-TOBE-DEAD WINGS...”
ALL
“LET US ACCEPT ONE ANOTHER...”

"The Prom"

38.
TRENT
“FORGET YOUR POLITICS...”
ALL
“WE’RE SISTER AND BROTHER...”
TRENT
“SO LET’S NOT BE TOTAL DICKS...
BIGOTRY'S NOT BIG OF ME AND IT'S
NOT BIG OF YOU...”
ALL
“OOH LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER TO
MAKE RAINBOW DREAMS COME TRUE...!”
TRENT
Ladies and gentlemen, the nonequity cast of Godspell and one
time Drama Desk winner, Barry
Glickman.

Dance break.
BARRY
“ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME!
ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME!
ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME! ACCEPT ME!”
ALL
“LET US ACCEPT ONE ANOTHER, JOIN
OUR FIGHT TODAY, WE’RE SISTER AND
BROTHER...”
TRENT
“MAKE PEOPLE HEAR US WHEN WE SAY:”
They sign the following few verses in silence.
TRENT (CONT'D)
“LET’S ALL WORK TOGETHER...”
ALL
“LET’S MAKE A RAINBOW...”
TRENT
“AND MAKE RAINBOW DREAMS COME
TRUE...”
GODSPELL CAST
“ACCEPTANCE, ACCEPTANCE,
ACCEPTANCE, ACCEPTANCE...”
Angie appears, dressed as a Goddess of Love. TWO GODSPELL
KIDS pull rainbow banners out of her costume.

"The Prom"

39.
ALL
“LET’S MAKE RAINBOW DREAMS COME
TRUE. Acceptance!”

The song ends. In a moment of great theatrically, HUGE
MONSTER TRUCKS race towards twin ramps and then FLY OVER THE
HEADS of our performers. Big finish! Crickets from the crowd.
TRENT
So are you with us people?!
We hear the stunned audience start to boo them. A few beer
bottles and other debris gets tossed onto the stage. They are
shocked and try to duck and quickly retreat.
INT. MOTEL LOBBY -- CONVERSATION PIT AREA -- DAY (LATER)
The Broadway contingent sits, drowning their sorrow in junk
food from the help-yourself-bar.
DEE DEE
Trent, I want to rip your face off!
TRENT
I’m sorry -BARRY
You made me fail and I am so sick
of failing!
SHELDON
There’s no spinning this. It was a
complete disaster.
ANGIE
Now I know what the original cast
of “Carrie” felt like.
DEE DEE
No. No you don’t.
BARRY
What do we do now?
DEE DEE
We leave. We kill Trent and then
leave.
BARRY
But what about the girl?
Hawkins appears with Emma in tow.

"The Prom"

40.
HAWKINS
Hi. Emma and I wanted to be the
ones to tell you...thanks to
pressure from the State’s
Attorney’s office, Prom is back on.
We did it!

BARRY

They all scream with delight.
TRENT
We were the vessel of change
because we acted selflessly.
DEE DEE
See? We’re not narcissists!
HAWKINS
To be clear, it wasn’t because of
you...
EMMA
Maybe it was. I mean, everyone
started freaking out when you got
here. That lawyer might have had
the legal power, but you really
scared people.
Awww.

TRENT, ANGIE, SHELDON, BARRY & DEE DEE

ANGIE
Don’t sell yourself short kid.
You’re the one who scared people.
HAWKINS
Well, the important thing is, it’s
a victory. Now you get to go to
Prom just like anybody else!
EMMA
Oh my God, it’s like four days
away.
BARRY
What are you going to wear?
EMMA
Well, I thought I’d wear a vintage
tux and some high tops. Does it
matter?

"The Prom"

41.
BARRY
Does it...
(can’t get the word out)
Mmmm-mmm
(recovers)
Look, sweetheart, you don’t know me
and I don’t know you. But I’m
begging here; let me dress you for
Prom. Come on. We’re going to Saks.
HAWKINS
Um, there is no Saks here.
EMMA
We have a Kmart...
BARRY
A Kkkkk-kkkk
(recovers)
Fine. We’ll check out the Tammy
Wynette collection at Kmart, and
when that doesn’t work, well, I
have a few party dresses in my
closet, you know, for emergencies.
I’ll have them Fedexed. We’ll have
a little fashion show.
EMMA
Okay. Can we do it tomorrow? I have
to go and find out if I still have
a date. We can meet at my place.
DEE DEE
Won’t your parents have a problem
with a middle-aged man hanging out
in your bedroom and dressing you?
HAWKINS
Emma doesn’t live with her parents
anymore.
EMMA
We don’t really speak.
BARRY
My God. We are the same person. I
haven’t spoken to my mother in
years.
EMMA
I live with my grandmother now.
She’s cool. She likes “the gays.”

"The Prom"

42.
BARRY
Good. And I like “the olds.” Can
you do me a favor and point me in
the direction of the Kmart?
EMMA
I’ll give you a ride.
BARRY
In your pickup truck?
EMMA
Are you saying because I’m a
lesbian I drive a pickup?
BARRY
Well, do you?
Shut up.

EMMA

They leave.
SHELDON
Anybody hungry?
ANGIE
I could drink.
SHELDON
What’s around here?
TRENT
Well, I saw a Big Boy out by the
highway.
SHELDON
This town has a gay bar?
They exit. Dee Dee and Hawkins are left alone.
HAWKINS
So nice to see Emma smile. She’s
had a rough time of it.
DEE DEE
I gathered that.
HAWKINS
Even before this whole Prom
controversy. When she came out, her
parents were...well, they threw her
out of the house.

"The Prom"

43.

Really?

DEE DEE

HAWKINS
She was 16. It was pretty ugly.
Anyway, thank you for helping her.
Or trying to.
Hawkins starts to leave.
DEE DEE
Tell me Tom; is there a restaurant
in this town with plates and
cutlery?
HAWKINS
Oh. Well, um...there’s an Applebees
at the mall. Would you like to go?
DEE DEE
Yes. Take me now to this apples and
bees place.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- DAY
There is some sort of commotion going on. Alyssa notices and
stops a student.
ALYSSA
What's going on?
FEMALE STUDENT
Nick's got a promposal all planned
out for Kaylee. She’s gonna freak
out!
The crowd parts to reveal Nick with a bouquet of red roses.
Two other MALE STUDENTS back him up. Everyone films it with
their phones. Someone pulls Kaylee forward as everybody
cheers. Emma wanders in and watches from across the room.
NICK
“SINCE J.V. FOOTBALL, I'VE BEEN
ADORED, BIG MAN ON CAMPUS
BUT OH, SO BORED...”
“MY LIFE WAS PERFECT BUT SO
ROUTINE, I PRAYED FOR SOMEONE TO
INTERVENE, AND THEN...”
NICK & ENSEMBLE
“YOU HAPPENED...”

"The Prom"

44.
NICK
“AND TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
ENTIRELY...”
NICK & ENSEMBLE
“OH, BABY YOU HAPPENED...”
NICK
“AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
SO GO TO PROM WITH ME, KAYLEE!”
KAYLEE
You’re such an idiot! Yes!

Everyone cheers. Kevin sees Shelby.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- DAY
Kevin puts on a sombrero. Two backup singers slip in behind
him with maracas in hand.
KEVIN
“THERE’S NOT ONE SUBJECT THAT I
COULD PASS, BEFORE YOU WALKED INTO
MY SPANISH CLASS. WAS MY HEART
POUNDING? I WON'T SAY NO,'CAUSE
LIFE WITHOUT YOU WAS “NO BUENO,”
AND THEN...”
KEVIN & ENSEMBLE
“YOU HAPPENED...”
KEVIN
“AND TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
ENTIRELY...”
KEVIN & ENSEMBLE
“OH, BABY YOU HAPPENED...”
KEVIN
“AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,
SO GO TO PROM WITH ME, SHELBY!”
SHELBY
Sí! Sí! Señor!
REVEAL Emma and Alyssa up in the stands, watching.
ALYSSA
You did it! You actually did it! We
have a prom because of you! It’s
like a love bomb went off. I’ve
seen like six promposals today.

"The Prom"

45.
EMMA
People are going to see us dancing
together! And kissing! It’s going
to be impossible not to kiss you.
ALYSSA
Oh my God. And what’s my mother
going to do? She’ll be in public,
so she can’t freak out.
EMMA
It doesn’t matter what she does.
This is about us. This is about us
finally being us.
(then)
“AND NO MORE HIDING HOW WE FEEL
ANYMORE...”
ALYSSA
“I WON’T HIDE IF YOU’RE BY MY
SIDE...”
EMMA
“NOW THAT THE PROM IS BACK ON TRACK
AND ONCE WE WALK INTO THAT GYM HAND
IN HAND...”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“IT’S PRETTY OBVIOUS THERE’S NO
GOING BACK!”
ALYSSA
“AND THAT’S A PROMISE!

INT. STUDY HALL -- DAY (LATER)
Students have their heads down, studying. TIGHT on Alyssa’s
notebook where she’s clandestinely writing AG LOVES EN.
Alyssa looks up to see Emma across the room, smiling at her.
This is how they have to navigate the school -- in private
stolen moments.
ALYSSA
BEFORE I MET YOU, I WAS A MESS, NOT
HONEST WITH MYSELF, I CONFESS...”
EMMA
“I WAS SO LONELY, A TOTAL WRECK
JUST SAD AND HOPELESS? CHECK,
DOUBLE-CHECK...”

"The Prom"

46.

The students don’t notice their singing, they keep their
heads down. Alyssa scribbles a note, takes off a ring, puts
the ring in the folded paper and heads toward Emma.
EMMA & ALYSSA
“AND THEN YOU HAPPENED AND TURNED
MY LIFE AROUND ENTIRELY, OH,
BABY...”
EMMA & ALYSSA (CONT'D)
YOU HAPPENED AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME...”
EMMA, ALYSSA & ENSEMBLE
“SOMETHING SO TRUE HAPPENED AND
SOON IT'S TIME TO SHARE IT PUBLICLY
AND ALL ‘CAUSE YOU HAPPENED...”
Alyssa slyly drops off the note. Emma enters it, reads it -“Will you go to prom with me? Put on the ring if it’s a YES.”
ALYSSA
“AND SAID YOU’D GO TO PROM WITH --”
EMMA
“SAID YOU’D GO TO PROM WITH --”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“SAID YOU’D GO TO PROM WITH ME...”
Emma puts on the ring, Alyssa grins.
ENSEMBLE
“YOU HAPPENED! YOU HAPPENED! YOU
HAPPENED! LOOK WHAT. HAPPENED TO
ME...”
The bell rings. Emma and Alyssa exchange sweet looks as they
go. Their PINKIES barely touch. But Kaylee and Shelby clock
this.
SHELBY
What the hell was that?
INT. APPLEBEES -- NIGHT
Dee Dee and Hawkins are in a booth.
HAWKINS
I save up all my money and I go to
New York every summer. I see as
many Broadway shows as I can. When
I run out of money, I second act
‘em.

HAWKINS (CONT'D)
My point is I’ve seen you many,
many times. I missed your Eleanor.
DEE DEE
“You didn’t miss a thing.”
HAWKINS
Are you choking?
DEE DEE
No. I was doing Eleanor. That was
the voice I used...
HAWKINS
Oh. It’s uncanny.

Mrs. Greene crosses with a FRIEND.
MRS. GREENE
Mr. Hawkins?
HAWKINS
Mrs. Greene.
MRS. GREENE
Ms. Glickman.
DEE DEE
Allen. Dee Dee Allen. Do you not
have the internet in Indiana? Just
type in Dee Dee. I’m the second one
that comes up after Dee Dee Myers,
whoever that is.
HAWKINS
She was Clinton’s press secretary.
DEE DEE
Whatever. There’s no excuse for
ignorance is my point.
MRS. GREENE
You and your friends know nothing
about us, about our town, about our
people. And yet, you feel justified
in telling us what to do.
HAWKINS
Miss Allen is a Tony Award winning
Broadway star -MRS. GREENE
Well, I suggest she stick to
acting.
(MORE)

"The Prom"

48.
MRS. GREENE (CONT'D)
Clearly she is a much more
compelling personality when someone
tells her where to stand and what
to say.

Mrs. Greene and her friend leave.
HAWKINS
I’m sorry about that. You have to
understand this town’s been through
a lot. We had an auto parts factory
that closed down because of
outsourcing. A lot of families
left.
DEE DEE
We didn’t mean to make things
worse.
HAWKINS
And I appreciate that. It’s just
people are angry and scared and
powerless. When that happens, you
look for a scapegoat. Not that I’m
making excuses for her...
DEE DEE
Let’s drop it. You know, I’ve never
said this before to someone, but:
tell me about you.
HAWKINS
About me? Huh. I don’t know. I’m
just a small town principal. It can
be frustrating but at least I have
a job.
(shyly)
Single.
Sorry?

DEE DEE

HAWKINS
I’m single. Just putting that out
there.
DEE DEE
Really? I’m surprised.

"The Prom"

49.
HAWKINS
I’m surprised you’re surprised.
There are two things in life I’m
passionate about -- Broadway
Musicals and Secondary School
Administration. I typed that into a
dating website once and a little
message popped up that said “You
will have zero matches ever.”
DEE DEE
But you’re smart, you’re goodlooking...
HAWKINS
...and if I liked NASCAR and beer
I’d fit right in.
(then)
I grew up 20 miles from here. This
is my home. But as long as I can
remember, I’ve felt like an alien.
I look at people like you, and I
think how lucky you are to be
surrounded by your people...
DEE DEE
Well, I wasn’t born on Broadway.
I’m from Zelienople, PA. I grew up
dirt poor. You know my prom story?
I sold my aquarium to buy my dress,
THAT’S my prom story. This
glittering, magical icon who
everyone loves and everyone thinks
they know? I INVENTED that. Deep
down, I’m a small town kid, just
like you. And I’m also single.
Well, divorced...
HAWKINS
I think I read about that. Eddie
Sharpe. The talk show host?
DEE DEE
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing
years. He’s a parasite. He’s got a
hit TV show and he’s still bleeding
me dry. I hate his money-sucking
guts.
HAWKINS
Well, you gave it a good shot.
That’s commendable. For me,
relationships have a 6-month
expiration date.

"The Prom"

50.
DEE DEE
It wasn’t really 15 years. I mean,
I wasn’t... ...present for more
than three. I was touring. Doing
concerts. He wanted kids at one
point. A girl makes choices, you
know? He’s still a loser, don’t get
me wrong. But there’s two sides to
every story.
HAWKINS
I imagine it’s not easy. Being Dee
Dee Allen. Being a Broadway star.
DEE DEE
It is a lot of work. And the truth
is Broadway is changing. And I’m
getting older. Not old, just older.
Sometimes I think I should just
quit.
HAWKINS
No. Please. You can’t do that!
Why?

DEE DEE

HAWKINS
I need you to keep doing what you
do.
(then)
“MY DAYS HAVE LITTLE GLAMOUR,
WRITING MEMOS, MAKING CALLS AND
WINCING AT THE GRAMMAR WRITTEN ON
THE BATHROOM WALLS, IT'S ALL SCHOOL
SUPPLIES AND BUDGET SIZE AND WADING
THROUGH RED TAPE, THAT'S WHY I LOVE
THE THEATRE, IT'S HOW I ESCAPE...”
DEE DEE
So theatre’s a distraction...is
that what you’re saying?
HAWKINS
No, a distraction is momentary. An
escape helps you heal.
EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT (1998)
A very sweet Hawkins makes his way down Broadway, marveling
at the glamour, the excitement. He enters a theatre, a
marquee reveals he is seeing “Swallow the Moon.”

"The Prom"

51.
MR. HAWKINS
“WE LOOK TO YOU, TO TAKE US AWAY
FROM THE SOUL-CRUSHING JOBS AND
EMASCULATING PAY...”

INT. BROADWAY THEATRE -- NIGHT (1998)
Hawkins makes his way down the aisle to his seat.
MR. HAWKINS
“WHEN OUR LIVES COME UP SHORT AND
OUR HOPES ARE SAD AND FEW YOU WHISK
US OFF TO SOMEPLACE STRANGE AND
NEW...”
He takes his seat, excited.
MR. HAWKINS (CONT’D (CONT'D)
“WE LOOK TO YOU, IN GOOD TIMES AND
BAD, THE WORLDS YOU CREATE, MAKE
THE REAL ONE SEEM LESS SAD...”
The curtain RISES, revealing Dee Dee in place, she gets a
huge ovation. Mr. Hawkins’ eyes glisten with emotion.
MR. HAWKINS (CONT'D)
“THE CURTAIN GOES UP AND EVERY NOW
AND THEN, IT FEELS AS IF WE'RE
COMING HOME AGAIN, YES, COMING HOME
AGAIN...”
INT. APPLEBEE’S -- NIGHT
He continues singing to Dee Dee.
MR. HAWKINS
“WE NEED A PLACE TO RUN TO WHEN
EVERYTHING GOES WRONG, WHERE THE
ANSWER TO EACH PROBLEM IS TO BURST
INTO A SONG. AND STANDARD RULES OF
LOGIC JUST SIMPLY DON'T APPLY, WHEN
PEOPLE DANCE IN UNISON AND NO ONE
WONDERS WHY...”
DEE DEE
You make it sound so beautiful.
HAWKINS
“WE LOOK TO YOU, AS STRANGE AS IT
SEEMS, WHEN REALITY GOES
TO SCARY, NEW EXTREMES...”

"The Prom"

52.

INT. BROADWAY THEATRE -- NIGHT (1998)
The performance ends and Dee Dee gets a standing ovation.
Hawkins is the first up, and he is cheering the loudest. It’s
incredibly sweet. The rest of the CAST joins her for curtain
call as she receives a bouquet of flowers, Hawkins looks
around the theatre, very emotional.
MR. HAWKINS
“SO DON'T EVER GIVE UP AND THIS I
GUARANTEE, NEXT TIME YOU THINK NO
ONE CARES, YOU CAN LOOK TO ME...”
INT. APPLEBEE'S -- NIGHT
DEE DEE
Thank you. That means a lot.
HAWKINS
No, thank you.
INT. GRANDMA BEA’S HOUSE -- DAY
It’s a typical midwestern house. Barry is looking at family
pictures. He finds one of Emma and her Grandmother, BEA -clearly taken at the photo department of a chain store. He is
looking at it when Bea enters with a tray of lemonade.
BARRY
Nice picture.
BEA
It's terrible. Look at the
backdrop. Clouds? Are we flying?
BARRY
It's sweet.
BEA
Well, you know, she needed proof
that she was still part of a
family, and nothing says family
like a Sears family portrait.
She hands him a lemonade. He drinks it.
BARRY
Is there booze in this?
BEA
There sure is.
BARRY
When you said lemonade --

"The Prom"

53.
BEA
It's Indiana lemonade.
BARRY
Okay. I love you. You're the cool
grandmother I never had. Mine was
all about sour candies and shame.
BEA
I’m not cool. I just have zero
tolerance for bullshit, which I
happen to think is a Republican
value. At least it used to be.
BARRY
You’re a Republican?
BEA
You can still like pot and hate big
government.
BARRY
You are a crazy, beautiful person.
Okay -- let me ask you something.
What happened with Emma and her
parents? How did she end up living
with you?

Bea takes a deep breath.
BEA
Ah, my daughter was such a good
kid. Straight A’s. 4 H club. Played
the guitar. She was a lot like
Emma, actually, when she was young.
Then she went to Kelley and got her
MBA and met Alan. He was her TA.
They got married and had Emma. Then
they started playing golf all the
time.
BARRY
I don’t get golf.
BEA
And when Emma came out, they
couldn’t handle it. “What can’t you
handle?” I said. “Reality?” I
raised my daughter to be strong. I
thought she was. Anyway, Alan got a
job offer in Baltimore and they
asked me to take Emma.

"The Prom"

54.

I’m sorry.

BARRY

BEA
You’re not a mother, so you can’t
know what it was like for me to see
my daughter give up her child. They
offered me $200 a month for
expenses.
Barry can see the toll the ordeal has taken on Bea. He gives
her a long hug. He sits back down, raises his glass.
BARRY
To bad parents and their broken
progeny.
BEA
Emma’s doing fine. She’s a strong
kid.
BARRY
I’m not talking about her.
Barry takes a swig, quietly emotional.
BEA
Oh no. You got kicked out too?
BARRY
Well...I left before they could do
that.
Grandma lifts her glass to him and they both take a swig of
lemonade. Barry notices a photo of Bea as a young woman.
BARRY (CONT'D)
Is that...were you at Woodstock?
BEA
No. Altamont. Yep, Barry...life has
been a barrel of laughs.
Emma comes down with a sad dress. They both turn to look.
EMMA
So the only nice dress I have is
this.
BARRY
Wow, so you could wear that to your
prom or it might also work if you
were a flight attendant for Kosovo
Airlines.

"The Prom"

55.
BEA
It’s official. I like him.
BARRY
Listen, I don’t really know you and
you don’t really know me, but
please, let me dress you for the
prom.
BEA
He’s Grandma Bea approved.
EMMA
I don’t know...this is all so
crazy. What did you wear to your
prom?
BARRY
Well. I was going to wear a silver
tux...

INT. BARRY’S BEDROOM PAST -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The YOUNG BARRY dresses in front of the mirror in his
childhood bedroom. He looks vulnerable.
BARRY (V.O.)
...with matching turquoise
cummerbund and tie, and those
contacts that change your eye color
to aqua blue...
INT. GRANDMA BEA’S HOUSE -- DAY
We are back in the present.
BARRY
...but I never... I didn’t, uh...
(he becomes emotional)
This isn’t about me, this is about
you and I promise: you are going to
have the night of your life. What’s
your date wearing?
EMMA
I don’t know. I’ve never been to
her house. Her mother doesn’t know
about us.
BARRY
How long have you been together?
EMMA
A year and a half.

"The Prom"

56.

Oh, honey.

BARRY

EMMA
But she’s coming out tonight big
time. That’s the plan. Oh, I’m
really scared.
BARRY
Look. I never went to my prom
because like your mystery
girlfriend, I didn’t have your
courage.
EXT. GYM PAST -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
A young Barry stands outside of the gym, resplendent in his
silver tux. Music blasts from within. He sees happy hetero
couples running in arm and arm. One particularly handsome boy
strides by with his posse. Barry watches him walk into the
gym. The sense is that he is Barry’s crush, and that he has
no idea. Barry turns and walks away.
INT. GRANDMA BEA'S HOUSE -- DAY
We are back in the present.
BARRY
The point is, you are brave. You
made all this happen. When you walk
into that gym tonight, you know
what people are going to see? The
bravest person on the planet.
EMMA
I don’t know. This is hard. Does
every girl go through this?
Of course!

BARRY

BEGIN MONTAGE. As Barry describes the exciting action, we see
the various teen girls of Edgewater Indiana dressing for the
Prom.
EXT. INDIANA -- DAY
A FLY OVER of the midwestern houses and cul de sacs of
Edgewater. The comfortable houses all look the same.
BARRY (V.O.)
All across town, girls are spraying
on their tans and whitening their
teeth ...

"The Prom"

57.

INT. HOUSE -- DAY
GIRL #1 uses an ultraviolet teeth whitener.
INT. HOUSE 2 -- DAY
GIRL #2 glues too many crystals around her eyes.
INT. HOUSE 3 -- DAY
GIRL #3 struggles to pull a dress onto GIRL #4.
BARRY (V.O.)
They’re trying to look their best
for the prom, but they’re wasting
their time. They might as well be
wearing a garbage bag with the word
“whore” spray-painted on it, you
know why?
INT. BEA’S HOUSE -- DAY
Emma and Bea look to Barry, waiting for the answer.
BARRY
Because they’re whores. Kidding.
It’s because they don’t have the
glow you have right now.
EMMA
I trust you completely; and that’s
kind of scary too.
BARRY
Can we mall it?
EMMA
Is that okay?
BEA
I think you should mall the hell
out of it!
INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- DAY
Barry and Emma enter the mall and stride through it.
BARRY
“I CAN TELL YOU’RE FEELING WARY,
BUT YOU CAN COUNT ON UNCLE BARRY,
HE TURN THIS BUTCHIE DUCK INTO A
SWAN..

BARRY (CONT'D)
OUR WHOLE LOOK COULD USE A SHAKEUP, YOU CAN BORROW ALL MY MAKE-UP
AND THE PAIR OF SPANX I CURRENTLY
HAVE ON...”
EMMA
I think I’ll pass.

INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- FOREVER 21 -- DAY
Barry is flipping through the dresses on a rack, taking the
odd one out and frowning, taking another out and tossing it.
BARRY
“TREAT THE WHOLE WORLD LIKE YOUR
RUNWAY, MAKE IT FIERCE, BUT IN A
FUN WAY, TRY TO FLIP YOUR HAIR LIKE
CHER AND DRAG QUEENS DO...”
INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- LAZURAS MAKE UP COUNTER -- DAY
Barry is smearing various lipstick shades on Emma’s lips.
BARRY
“AND I DON’T MEAN TO BE RUDE, DEAR,
BUT YOU COULD USE SOME ATTITUDE
DEAR...LET’S SHOW THE SCHOOL
TONIGHT BELONGS TO YOU...”
INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- DSW -- DAY
Barry is jamming various shoes on Emma’s feet.
BARRY
“ONE THING'S UNIVERSAL,
LIFE'S NO DRESS REHEARSAL,
SO WHY NOT MAKE SOME WAVES BEFORE,
IT'S THROUGH?”
He extracts a red pump with a 4 inch heel. She grimaces.
BARRY (CONT'D)
“GO BIG, OR YOU'VE BLOWN IT
IT'S TIME THAT YOU OWN IT
LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT
BELONGS TO YOU...”
INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- FOOD COURTYARD -- DAY
Barry and Emma refuel.
BARRY
Now, no matter what we choose,
you’ve got to remember to sell it.

"The Prom"

59.
EMMA
How do I do that?
BARRY
Allow Ms. Glickman to demonstrate.
BARRY (CONT'D)
“YOU MIGHT FIND THIS DISCONCERTING,
BUT OL’ BARRY’S DONE SOME FLIRTING,
TRY TO BAT YOUR EYES AND SMIZE EACH
TIME YOU GRIN...”

Barry flirts with a passing FOOD WORKER. The worker,
distracted, walks into a trash can and spills a tray.
EMMA
“I CAN GUESS YOUR WHOLE AGENDA...”
BARRY
“YOU BE ELPHIE; I'M GALINDA!”
BARRY & EMMA
“IT'S MAKEOVER TIME SO WHY NOT JUST
GIVE IN?”
INT. EDGEWATER MALL -- DAY
Barry and Emma stride through the mall in the opposite
direction, now burdened with a dozen bags.
BARRY & EMMA
“ONE THING'S UNIVERSAL, LIFE'S NO
DRESS REHEARSAL, SO WHY NOT MAKE
SOME WAVES, BEFORE IT'S THROUGH. GO
BIG, OR YOU'VE BLOWN IT...”
EMMA
“IT'S TIME THAT I OWN IT...”
BARRY & EMMA
“LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT
BELONGS TO YOU...”
What?

BARRY

EMMA
“BELONGS TO ME!”
Barry and Emma burst out of the mall.

INT. KAYLEE’S BEDROOM -- DAY
Kaylee and Shelby get ready for Prom, zipping each other up,
posing in the full length mirror.
KAYLEE
Oh God. I can’t believe this is
finally happening.
SHELBY
She almost ruined it for all of us.
KAYLEE
Well, what goes around comes
around. You look hot!
SHELBY
You look so hot!
KAYLEE & SHELBY
“WELL, I HATE TO SOUND CONCEITED
BUT THE BOYS GET OVERHEATED, WHEN I
STRIKE A POSE OR TWO LIKE THUS!”
They strike a few poses.
KAYLEE
“AND YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO ME
I MEAN, EVEN I WOULD DO ME...”
KAYLEE & SHELBY
“LET'S SHOW THE WORLD TONIGHT
BELONGS TO US...”
EXT. VARIOUS SUBURBAN HOUSES-- DAY
The teen girls of Edgewater emerge from their houses and walk
to the waiting limos. The boys, dressed in variations of the
classic tuxedo, open the car doors for them.
KAYLEE & SHELBY / FEMALE STUDENTS
“ONE THING'S UNIVERSAL, LIFE'S NO
DRESS REHEARSAL, EXCUSE ME WHILE I
STATE THE OBVIOUS, GO BIG OR YOU'VE
BLOWN IT, IT'S TIME THAT WE OWN IT
AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT,

INT. ALYSSA’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
Alyssa is smoothing her dress and fiddling with her hair. She
looks at herself in the mirror. She looks beautiful, but she
has a look of worry on her face (reminiscent of the young
Barry in his flashback). MRS. GREENE enters.

"The Prom"

61.
MRS. GREENE
Oh, you look so beautiful. You
should always wear your hair that
way.
ALYSSA
Mom. I want you to know what’s
going to happen tonight.
MRS. GREENE
Can we not spoil this? Please? I
have worked very hard on this
night, and I have a right to enjoy
it too. Now, you’re going to have a
wonderful prom like a normal girl.
I’ve made sure of that.
ALYSSA
What does that mean?
MRS. GREENE
“I DON'T LIKE WHEN STRANGERS GET IN
MY WAY, OR ANYONE WHO MESSES WITH
THE P.T.A., WELL MAYBE THAT’S JUST
ME, BUT TRUST ME. FIXING LITTLE
PROBLEMS IS WHAT I DO, NOW EVERYONE
IS HAPPY, I PROMISE YOU, AND I
WOULD NEVER MISS A NIGHT LIKE THIS

MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT BELONGS
TO, MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT
BELONGS TO US!
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
Trent, Dee Dee, Angie and Sheldon wait outside the gym. Emma
arrives with Barry. Emma is beautifully and expertly put
together by Barry. She looks great, but not entirely
comfortable with the look.

"The Prom"

62.
DEE DEE
You look beautiful!
EMMA
You're sure it's not too girly?
ANGIE
Just the right amount of girly.
DEE DEE
(to BARRY)
Well played.
BARRY
Where's your date?
EMMA
We're meeting in the gym. She's
still a little shy about all this.
BARRY
Okay. This is where we leave you.
Our work is done.
(Hugs her.)
Go! Have the time of your life!
EMMA
Can you walk me in? I’m a little
nervous.
BARRY
Sure. Hold on tight.

Barry takes her arm and they enter the gym.
TRENT
We did good you guys!
ANGIE
Who wants a drink?
SHELDON
I’m buying.
Angie, Trent and Sheldon trot off in search of booze. Dee Dee
hesitates. She looks around the parking lot. Something
doesn’t seem right.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
Emma enters with Barry. There are only a few, pathetic
decorations hanging limply from the walls. Hawkins stands in
the middle of the empty gym talking into his phone. He is
clearly distressed. Emma and Barry look around, dumbfounded.

"The Prom"

63.
EMMA
What’s going on?

Hawkins puts his hand over the mouthpiece of his phone.
HAWKINS
I’m just piecing this together...
give me a second.
Hawkins continues with his call.
EMMA
Where is everybody?
BARRY
What’s going on here?
Dee Dee, Angie, Sheldon & Trent enter.
DEE DEE
Something’s wrong. The parking lot
is completely empty.
SHELDON
My God. What’s the theme of this
prom: “Death Row”?
EMMA
Mr. Hawkins, where are all the
kids? I don’t understand.
INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
We see MRS. GREENE & ALYSSA arriving at another, welldecorated prom.
ALYSSA
I don’t understand. Why aren’t we
at the gym?
MRS. GREENE
At the last minute there was a
problem and we had to change
venues.
ALYSSA
Mom. What is going on? Tell me the
truth.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
HAWKINS hangs up and turns to address them.

"The Prom"

64.
HAWKINS
The courts told the PTA they had to
hold an inclusive prom --

INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
MRS. GREENE
Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We
did what we were required to do.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
HAWKINS
There was some resistance, so the
parents met without my knowledge
and organized two proms.
INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
MRS. GREENE
We gave her a prom.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
HAWKINS
One for all the kids at the Elks
lodge in town.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM/INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
We see a split screen of Alyssa and Emma realizing what has
happened.
Oh my God!

ALYSSA & EMMA

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
HAWKINS
And this one...just for you.
Emma is in shock.
INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
MRS. GREENE
Now go have fun. I’ll be here to
make sure everything is perfect.
Wait!

ALYSSA

MRS. GREENE walks away.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
EMMA
Wait. No. I got texts from kids at
school. Everybody said it was here.
HAWKINS
They were lying to you. That was
part of the plan.
Oh my God.

ANGIE

INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
Alyssa confronts Kaylee and Shelby.
ALYSSA
You lied to me!
KAYLEE
Yeah, who’s the liar?
SHELBY
We know about you and Emma. Believe
me, we’re doing you a favor.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
Emma begins to feel the full weight of the betrayal.
HAWKINS
Emma. I’m so sorry.
TRENT
They met in secret? The whole town
kept this from her?
ANGIE
That is so cruel.
BARRY
I think I’m going to cry.
DEE DEE
Oh my God. This is a disaster.
SHELDON
This is a PR problem -DEE DEE
No, Sheldon. We had a PR problem.
This is a full blown scandal. This
is the end of my career.

"The Prom"

66.
HAWKINS
Wait. Is that why you came here?
For publicity?
DEE DEE
Don’t start with me, Tom. You do
not know how the world works.
HAWKINS
Yes. I do. Unfortunately.
EMMA
(numb, slowly)
“ONE THING'S UNIVERSAL, LIFE'S NO
DRESS REHEARSAL, WHEN PEOPLE FIND A
SCAPEGOAT TO CONDEMN... WE WENT BIG
AND YET WE'VE BLOWN IT, WELL I

Emma's phone rings. Emma answers.
Alyssa?

EMMA (CONT'D)

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM/INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
We see a split screen of Alyssa and Emma on the phone.
ALYSSA
I swear, I had no idea.
EMMA
How could you not know? You were on
the prom committee.
ALYSSA
It was Kaylee and Shelby. They
figured out we were together and
they made sure I didn’t find out.
They didn’t want me to tell you.
EMMA
I don’t believe you.
ALYSSA
Do you think I would do something
like this to you?
EMMA
Then come meet me.

"The Prom"

67.
ALYSSA
I can't.
(crying.)
My mom is here.
EMMA
Well, leave her. Then tell her
you’re gay! Tell her we’re in love!
That was the plan, right?
ALYSSA
I can’t. It’s bad enough that
Kaylee and Shelby know. I’m sorry.
EMMA
You’re sorry. Great. That fixes
everything. Have fun at the normal
person’s prom!

She hangs up.
ALYSSA
Emma? Emma?
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- NIGHT
BARRY
This is what we’re going to do.
We’re getting in the car and we’re
going to that other prom. They
can’t stop us from -EMMA
No! Enough! This is already the
worst night of my life! Just stop
helping me!
She runs out.
ANGIE
I’ll talk to her.
Angie runs after Emma. Hawkins, Dee Dee, Trent, Sheldon &
Barry stand alone in the gym.
INT. ELK’S LODGE -- NIGHT
The kids at the real prom dance with intensity.

STUDENTS
“LET’S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TONIGHT
BELONGS TO, MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
TONIGHT BELONGS, MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
TONIGHT BELONGS TO US...!”
SMASH TO BLACK.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- STEPS -- DAY
Mrs. Greene is making a statement to the press on behalf of
the PTA. She is more rattled than we have seen her. She is
surrounded by a HUGE AMOUNT of reporters, it’s a national
news story now.
MRS. GREENE
I’ve been asked to read a
statement.
(reading)
What happened here was not the
result of some elaborate plan to
humiliate this girl, as has been
reported in the press. The James
Madison High School parent-teachers
association felt Emma would not be
safe if we allowed her to attend
Prom with the other students
because the uncomfortable truth is
there are people in our community
who are offended by her life
choices. We felt this arrangement,
while not ideal, was the only
course of action available to us.
Thank you.
Mrs. Greene attempts to leave but is stopped by questions.
INDIANA REPORTER #2
Mrs. Greene! Are you homophobic?
INDIANA REPORTER #3
How does excluding a student
protect her?
MRS. GREENE
Look. This is uncomfortable for
me...to be in front of a camera
like this, to read terrible things
about my town in the paper. I’m
just a mother, not any kind of a

MRS. GREENE (CONT'D)
The truth is we are in this
situation because a group of
people, privileged people from New
York, who know nothing about us,
came down here just to get
publicity. They are the villains.
You should be writing about them,
not us.

INT. EMMA’S BEDROOM -- DAY
Angie and Emma are watching Mrs. Greene on Emma’s laptop.
Emma looking particularly depressed. Angie snaps the laptop
shut.
EMMA
I cannot wrap my head around all
this. It’s a nightmare. Oh God.
ANGIE
I want to be the cockeyed optimist
here because I played Nelly Forbush
in South Pacific once, but...I
agree with you. This is horrible.
EMMA
Thanks for hanging out with me
these past couple of days. You’ve
been a good friend.
ANGIE
(eyes welling)
I have?
EMMA
You have. You seem surprised.
ANGIE
It’s just...when you’re a
struggling performer you spend so
much time worrying about yourself.
Staying in the game, controlling
your day drinking.
(a beat, emotional)
You’ve made me care about something
more than myself. Thanks, kid.
Emma smiles, but seems so low.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
Ok, look at me. And listen -you’ll get through this, I know it.

EMMA
How do you know?
ANGIE
You’re like me. You may not know
it, but you’re resilient. I knew it
the first time I saw you, I thought
“that girl has guts.”

PUSH IN on Emma, at rock bottom.
EMMA
I thought when my parents gave me
away and stopped loving me that it
would never feel any worse, you
know? And then I broke up with my
girlfriend, and that felt worse.
She starts to cry. Angie dries her tears.
ANGIE
(feeling for her)
Oh honey.
EMMA
And now this. There’s so much hate
out there in the world, and I can
feel it. It hurts so much. I’ve
never felt so alone in my life.
ANGIE
You’re not alone, honey. You’ve got
me. We are ride or die. And you
have friends.
EMMA
Oh yeah? Where are they?
EXT. HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
The bus pulls up. Barry, Dee Dee, Trent and Sheldon exit,
march up the lawn.

Grandma Bea opens the door.
DEE DEE
How is she?
BEA
Holding tight. C’mon in.

INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Barry pops in, followed by Trent, Dee Dee and Sheldon.
BARRY
Emma? Can we come in? We brought
Haagen-Dazs.
TRENT
It’s fancy ice cream.
EMMA
I know what Haagen-Dazs is.
Hand it over.
BARRY
How are you? Are you okay?
EMMA
Oh, I’m just awesome. The whole
world is talking about me. They’re
making it sound like I’m
responsible for this. No one is
talking about the hate. There’s
just so much hate.
(holding up the ice cream)
I’m going to need more of this.
BARRY
Listen, I know you said you don’t
want us to help anymore but we
can’t let them get away with this.
We have to fight back. That PTA
woman, who does she think she is?
TRENT
She’s a monster, that’s for sure.
BARRY
Sheldon, what can we do about her?
SHELDON
I don’t know. She’s spun this whole
thing to make herself look like the
victim. She’s good. If she didn’t
shop at The Dress Barn, she could
work in PR.
DEE DEE
I know that everyone is angry, but
we have to face the fact that we’ve
made matters worse. I think the
best thing we can do is disinfect
our things and go home.

"The Prom"

72.
BARRY
No! We are not leaving.
DEE DEE
We are always not leaving! Please
let me leave this horrible place!
BARRY
No. We are staying and we’re going
to turn this thing around. We are
going to take back the press.
How?

TRENT

BARRY
Emma, you gotta step up and be the
face of this story. You’ve gotta go
on TV and show the world who the
real victim is.
ANGIE
And that’s going to get her a Prom?
BARRY
This is not about a Prom anymore.
This is about right and wrong.
We need a national audience. Prime
time. How about Jimmy Fallon?
SHELDON
Look. I can’t just pull Jimmy
Fallon out of my ass. He books
months in advance. You want a big
audience fast, we gotta use our ace
in the hole.
(to Dee Dee)
One phone call to Eddie Sharpe is
all it will take.
DEE DEE
No. I am not calling that bastard.
BARRY
Just ask him for a favor.
DEE DEE
No! If I ask him for a favor he
will want something in return and
what he will want is the Hamptons
house. He’s been trying to get it
for years. You know how many
Broadway cruises I had to book to
pay for that house? No way.

BARRY
Fine. Sheldon, get that girl on TV.
I don’t care if it’s a cutaway on
Family Guy, just get it done. Work
your magic.

Sheldon exits.
BARRY (CONT'D)
Okay. Great.
EMMA
No! Not great. Not great. I’m sorry
but there is no way I am getting in
front of a camera and telling my
story to millions of people. I
cannot do that. Just go! Just get
on your bus and go home. We lost,
okay? Deal with it.
They all file towards the door. To Barry -TRENT
You know, there might be another
way to rid this community and by
extension this nation of the cancer
of intolerance.
BARRY
Why are you here? I thought you had
a tour.
TRENT
Oh. Indianapolis was cancelled. As
was Kansas City, Little Rock,
Orlando and the naval base at
Guantanamo Bay. What I’m thinking I
might do is this: venture forth and
seek out the young people. And when
I find them, I will simply talk
with them. Converse. Rap, in the
non-musical sense. Communication
may lead to understanding and
understanding to, dare I say it,
love. Anon.
Trent leaves.

Honey, I know this is hard, but if
you do nothing, they win.
ANGIE
Don’t worry. She’s just got stage
fright. I’ll talk to the kid.

The others leave. Angie and Emma are alone.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
Jeez Louis, you’ve almost eaten
that whole pint!
(a beat)
Let’s go get some more. Two spoons
this time.
INT. EMMA’S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
Angie waits, Emma enters with more ice cream and two spoons.
They begin to eat.
EMMA
Before you give me a lecture or
kick me to death with those crazy
antelope legs of yours or whatever
you’re going to do, I know I should
do something; I just can’t.
ANGIE
Look, kid. Not everybody gets a
chance to step out of the chorus.
You got to do it for all us people
who used to be called “gypsies.”
EMMA
I’m too scared.
ANGIE
Let me tell you a story. It's 1975.
The original company of “Chicago”
is in previews and the worst flu in
history hits the cast. They're down
to the third cover for the role of
Roxie Hart. And she's scared, just
like you. So Fosse, who's a real
ball-buster, is putting her through
her paces. But she's petrified, and
even worse, performing the routines
like a robot. And the Foss says to
her, “Hey, kid! Snap out of it!
You're freaking out!

"The Prom"

ANGIE (CONT'D)
You got the steps, you got the
notes, but where's the zazz,
baby?!” And though she'd never
heard that word before she
immediately knew what it meant. And
that girl went out there and
crushed that performance so hard
the whole audience was standing on
their feet screaming bloody murder.
EMMA
And that girl was you?
ANGIE
How fucking old do you think I am?
This was in 1975. The point is
every Fosse girl knows that story.
It’s all about finding your own
inner strength...
(then)
“WHEN A CHALLENGE LIES AHEAD AND
YOU ARE FILLED WITH DREAD AND
WORRY, GIVE IT SOME ZAZZ!”

Angie begins to dance around the living room, pushing back
chairs and table. The track lighting dims, and the space
suddenly seems very theatrical.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
“IF YOUR COURAGE DISAPPEARS,
WHAT'LL GET YOUR FEARS TO SCURRY?
GIVE IT SOME ZAZZ! ZAZZ IS STYLE
PLUS CONFIDENCE, IT MAY SEEM CORNY
OR KITSCH, BUT WHEN SCARED OR ON
THE FENCE, YOU’LL FIND THAT ZAZZ
WILL SOON MAKE FEAR BECOME YOUR
BITCH. AND IF FOLKS SAY YOU CAN'T
WIN, WHAT'LL STOP THEM IN A HURRY?
GIVE IT SOME ZAZZ! THERE'S NO
CONTEST FOR A GIRL WHO HAS
SOME RAZZMATAZZ. SO CALL THEIR
BLUFF, AND STRUT YOUR STUFF, LIKE
NO CHICK IN THIS HICK TOWN HAS,
INSTEAD OF GIVING UP, GIVE IT SOME

EMMA
I just don't think I can do it. The
thought of getting up in front of
all of those people. Look at my
hands. They're shaking.

"The Prom"

ANGIE
If your hands are shaking...
(sung)
“JUST TURN ‘EM INTO JAZZ HANDS!”
(spoken)
Now doesn't that feel better?
No.
Try this.

EMMA
ANGIE

She moves Emma’s hands into a Fosse position.
EMMA
What are you doing?
ANGIE
It’ll give you some confidence.
Hand here.
(pushes Emma’s pelvis
forward)
And try this. Now move.
EMMA
This is awkward.
ANGIE
You don’t understand the concept of
zazz. The zazz is not the moves.
The zazz comes from within. Do the
moves and give ‘em some zazz.
EMMA
I don’t know...
ANGIE
Now, close your eyes. Think of Mrs.
Greene.
Emma snaps into a Fosse pose.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
Think about that fake prom.
Emma snaps into another Fosse pose.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
And think about finally doing
something about it.
Emma snaps into another Fosse pose.

INT. DEE DEE’S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
Barry and Dee Dee are both prone on Dee Dee’s bed, their
faces covered in a light green facial product watching “My

BARRY
We shouldn’t be doing this.
DEE DEE
It’s Romcom Friday. Romcom Friday
is sacred.

Dee Dee! We should be helping Emma.
We’ve got to get her on TV.
DEE DEE
Sheldon is on it. Hey!
(stopping him)
You have to take care of yourself
before you take care of other
people. It’s like when you’re on a
plane.
What?

BARRY

DEE DEE
If the mask thing drops, you’re
supposed to put it on yourself
first, then your child. It’s the
law. Now, give in to romcom Friday.
Heal yourself first. Let the mask
work its magic. It’s Korean. They
have wonderful skin for a reason.
Barry gives in reluctantly. He grabs a bag of Cheetos from
the bedside table.
DEE DEE (CONT'D)
You have to applaud Julia for
playing such a misguided character.
She’s kind of the villain and I’m
with her every step of the way.
There is a beat. PUSH IN on Dee Dee. Then -DEE DEE (CONT'D)

Well I took him -- he was just
starting out as a comedian then -he had no money -- this is way
before his show... 15 years, he
never had any money. I picked up
the check. I paid.
Bad move.

BARRY

DEE DEE
Tell me about it. I’m still paying.
They watch some more. Barry considers her.
BARRY
Can I make an observation?
DEE DEE
Is it a pleasant observation, or an
irritating one?
BARRY
You’re not over him.
DEE DEE
Him? No no PLEASE TRUST me, I am,
no, I am way over him. I’m just -mad at myself, mostly -- because I
was so STUPID, such a putz.
DEE DEE (CONT'D)
Stupid, I bought it, so long,
believed him, every time he said,
“it’s nothing” “it’s over” “she’s
meaningless...” Ten years, “I broke
it off, she knows, it’s over, I
promise.” 6, what 7? Maybe 8 times?
Every time, I believed him. ME! So
stupid. Yeah, I got out, and he
took half my money... And now here
we are, singing to trucks, and he’s
got his big tv show, and I still
owe him half my unemployment
check...

A moment. Dee Dee stews, definitely NOT over this.
DEE DEE
But you know the worst thing he
did? The worst thing? He made me
never want to trust anybody again.
He took my little delicate
blueberry heart and just, squashed
it... And I will never NEVER let
that happen again...I don’t think I
even could... Even if I wanted to,
and I do want to, be loved by
somebody, held -- NOPE. THAT’s not
gonna happen. Ever again. Ever.
They turn back to the TV, now thoroughly bummed. Barry
searches frantically for the remote. He snaps off the TV.
Barry grabs a Kleenex. Begins to remove Dee Dee’s mask. They
sit across from each other. Tender.
BARRY
Let me tell you something sister.
Rom Com Friday is not helping us.
We irradiate our faces and cry
while Julia Roberts pretends to
fall in love with people, instead
of actually falling in love with
people ourselves. It’s pathetic.
It’s fun.

DEE DEE

It’s getting less and less fun for
me, and you, and Julia. You gotta
get out there.

yellow cape, cute boots -- and
march yourself right down to the

Tom?? He’s just a fan. Friend.

much that anymore...

Please. Let’s cut the bullshit. I’d
kill to have a guy look at me the
way he looks at you.
BARRY (CONT'D)
I’ve been a curiosity, an
experiment, a way into the club.
I’ve never been the object of that
wide-eyed, slobbering small town
principal gaze. I’ve never
experienced it.

Stop it. It’s like you’re poking my
heart with your finger.
BARRY
Your delicate still-beating
blueberry heart.
DEE DEE
You really think...he likes me?

Yes. Do it for me. If I’m going to
love vicariously through someone, I
want it to be you, not Julia
Roberts.

that little gay heart of yours.
BARRY

Please no. Okay fine. Do I only go
for tens when I know I’m a six?
YES. Am I in a perpetual state of
eating my feelings? YES but that
also means I don’t struggle with
wrinkles...
DEE DEE
Your parents. Aren’t you from Ohio?
So?

BARRY

DEE DEE
And we’re in Indiana. Ohio and
Indiana, they’re close, right?

Oh, don’t judge. I know where New
York and California are. In between
is where the planes fly over and
presumably drop their waste.

I’m going to open the car door and
roll out onto the highway.

You have two living parents who
you’re never going to be closer to
than you are right now. You should
call them.
BARRY
No. They threw me away.
DEE DEE
DID they, though?
BARRY
YES! I told them I was gay and they
told ME they’d take me to therapy
to change myself completely. That’s
not love. That’s not how you’re
supposed to be a parent.
DEE DEE
Come on. It was a different time!
They didn’t know any better! There
was no Ellen! There was no Will and
Grace! There was no...me!
BARRY
There was Frasier! That’s the
gayest show ever! That brother? I’m
surprised America’s televisions
weren’t bursting into flames!

unworthy of love because you
haven’t dealt with your painful
unresolved adolescent issues, and
until you do there you shall
remain, there I said it, sue me.

He becomes emotional and cries. She holds him. A moment.

You know where everybody goes

We don’t have a drama program.

Ah. That explains your general lack

Me?

TRENT
Who are you?
Kaylee.

KAYLEE

TRENT
No, that’s your name. Who are you?
Let’s say I am to play Kaylee in

prepare.
KAYLEE
Uh... I’m a girl. A teenager. I’m a
cheerleader.
TRENT
And why do you hate homosexuals?
KAYLEE
Hey! I’m a good person! Right,

We go to church.

Ah! Okay. Now we’re getting

about. Christians follow the
teachings of Christ, correct?
Yeah...

ALL

TRENT
I’ve played Jesus Christ on three
separate occasions. I’ve been
crucified three times; twelve if
you include the reviews. I got to
know J.C. very well. I don’t
believe he hated anyone, let alone
gays.
SECOND STUDENT
But the Bible says homosexuality is
wrong. And we follow the Bible.
TRENT
Okay. Well, I’m pretty sure there
are rules in the Bible that you
guys are breaking every day.
KAYLEE
Well, that's different.
TRENT
Is it? You can’t cherry-pick the
Bible, choosing which parts you
want to believe.
KAYLEE
We don’t do that.
TRENT
You don’t? What’s this?

TATTOO WOULD BE TABOO, KAYLEE GUESS

You know, you make a lot of sense.
KAYLEE

SHELBY
You don’t feel even slightly bad

KAYLEE
That was before she turned gay.
SHELBY
Well, maybe she was always gay.

Exactly. Because that’s how God

ALYSSA
Wow. Okay. I guess I want to say
I’m sorry for what happened.
EMMA
Were you in on it?
ALYSSA
I didn’t even know about it until I

EMMA
Nobody told you? What about your
BFF’s Shelby and Kaylee? They
didn’t mention anything about the

ALYSSA
They are not my friends!
EMMA
Okay, so your mother then? She was
behind the whole thing.
ALYSSA
Emma. You know me.
EMMA
Do I? What is this? What are we?
ALYSSA
You know what we are.
EMMA
No I don’t. Maybe I’m some kind of
an experiment? Or you’re just
trying to piss off your mother?
ALYSSA
Stop. Stop it.
EMMA
Do you know what it was like
standing there in that stupid dress
alone in the gym? Knowing that
people got together and planned the
best way to hurt me? To humiliate
me? The only way it could have been
worse is if a bucket of pig’s blood
fell on my head.
ALYSSA
It must have been awful.

"The Prom"

EMMA
It was. But the worst part -- the
worst part was that you didn’t

I couldn’t.

some people you have to scrape away
the crap to see it. So. This is
what’s going to happen: I’m going
to do my thing, and in the end,
there will be a kick ass Prom in
Edgewater Indiana for everybody,
regardless of who they happen to
love. I know it.

That would be wonderful.

Don’t make me cry. I look so
fat...when I cry.

Yes. I’ll go with you. Can I wear
my silver tux? The one I never
wore? I still have it. Of course it
needs major renovations. But I
could have it FedExed.

heard about the fake prom in
Indiana? Well, that was me. It was
truly awful in every way. I was
feeling sorry for myself, but then
after talking with some friends I
decided to take all that awfulness
and maybe make something good out
of it. So I wrote this song for all
the people out there, who just love
someone in a way that the rest of
the world can’t understand. I’m

Especially with the kids.

Great. So, when’s the Prom?
HAWKINS
There’s no money left.
DEE DEE
What do you mean?
HAWKINS
We already paid for a Prom,
remember? This is a town in
crisis, you must have noticed that.
Still, a miracle might happen. It’s
early.
BARRY
Okay people. This is it. It’s
Mickey and Judy time. This is where
we roll up our sleeves and build
this girl a Prom with our bare
hands. I don’t care if we decorate
that gym with our own blood and
hair -- Emma is getting the prom
she deserves!
DEE DEE
Wait. What are we talking about
here? How much does a Prom cost?
HAWKINS
Well, it won’t be a school
sanctioned event, so we’ll have to
pay a rental fee for the gym. Let’s
see: say 400 kids -- food, a DJ,
lighting...I’d say about $30,000.
BARRY
(handing Hawkins his credit
card)
Here. You can charge up to 10,000.
That’s my limit. It’s a long story,
but I had to declare bankruptcy
after my self-produced “Notes on a
Scandal.”
HAWKINS
10 thousand. You really want to do
that?

Um... Well I can add 500. That’s
about half.

Come on. I know you have an

Barry goes. Dee Dee stops him, leading him into the hallway.
DEE DEE
Barry. Wait. I need to talk to you
about something. It’s pressing.
What?

BARRY

DEE DEE
Look, I did a lot of thinking. That
thing you and I talked about -BARRY
How ‘Starlight Express’ is an
overlooked gem and deserves a major
revival like, NOW???
DEE DEE
I mean how if you don’t deal with
your past, you’re not going to be
able to move on in love or in life-BARRY
Is that all in ‘Starlight Express’?
DEE DEE
(blurting it out)
I called your mother.
BARRY
(flabbergasted)
What? How?
DEE DEE
I found her number on your phone.
BARRY
But. How did you know my password?
DEE DEE
I guessed. 9-4-81. Beyonce’s
birthday. Got it on the first try.
BARRY
Dee Dee -- why would you call her?
DEE DEE
Because I knew you couldn’t do it
on your own.
BARRY
(a beat, then)
Well -- what did she say?

"The Prom"

DEE DEE
I should let her tell you that.

She turns, revealing VERA, Midwestern and soft and sweet.
Hi, Barry.

VERA

Overwhelmed, Barry retreats, hardening.
BARRY
No. This is not fair. You don’t get
to do this. You don’t get to just
show up out of nowhere-VERA
I came all this way, Barry. It took
me half an hour on the Interstate
to get here all the way from Ohio -BARRY
Well, you can turn around and go
back.
VERA
(gently)
You called me. Didn’t you. That was
you who called and hung up, wasn’t
it?
(then, emotional)
I handled this all wrong, honey,
and I’m so sorry. Your father and
I, when you told us -- I can’t even
remember what we said -- but
whatever it was, clearly it was
wrong because it drove you away.
BARRY
You told me I needed to see a
therapist. Which I DO -- but not
about THAT. Do you have any idea
how much that hurt? And how insane
it sounds now?
VERA
(fighting emotion)
Yes! Now it does! But back then -and I know it wasn’t even that long
ago -- when you told us what you
were, WHO you were, your father and
I -- we were scared! We hardly knew
what GAY meant! All we knew was how
hard your life was going to be!
(MORE)

"The Prom"

111.
VERA (CONT'D)
And we wanted you to have children - which you can do now, and it’s
wonderful! But back then, we both
thought that we’d failed you
somehow, like maybe it was our
fault. For YEARS, I have asked
myself the haunting question
“should I have taken Barry to see
Barbra Streisand in The Prince of
Tides”?

Barry resists, not letting his guard down.
BARRY
So NOW it’s okay. Now that gay is
‘normal’ to you, it’s okay. What I
needed from you was to be my mother
who didn’t know it was okay yet and
who loved me anyway! You think you
were scared? How do you think I
felt???
VERA
I know! I know that I failed you,
Barry! That will be on my heart til
the day I die. All I can say now is
that I was wrong and I’m sorry and
every one of my prayers is asking
God for you to forgive me...
BARRY
What about Dad? Why didn’t he come?
VERA
(pained)
He’s not -- he’s just not there
yet, I’m sorry to say. But I know
in my heart that with some
forgiveness from you -- someday
very soon...he will be.
Barry bursts into tears. She does too as he falls into her
arms.
VERA (CONT'D)
Barry, I’m so sorry. I missed you
so much -- please forgive me...
BARRY
I missed you, too, Mom. I forgive
you...
They look at one another, raw, wounded, but now whole.

"The Prom"

VERA
I hear you’re putting on a Prom. I
wonder if you might need a
chaperone sort of person...to guard
the punch bowl and smile a whole
lot?

Yeah, I’d like that...

He takes her by the arm and leads her away.
INT. MRS. GREENE AND ALYSSA’S HOME -- DAY
Alyssa watches Emma’s video on her phone.
MRS. GREENE
Aren’t you tired of watching that?
ALYSSA
8 million people have seen it. 8
million people.
MRS. GREENE
Well, she got the attention she
wanted, didn’t she? I just don’t
understand it.
What?

ALYSSA

MRS. GREENE
This need to share everything about
yourself with strangers.
ALYSSA
I think it’s brave. You know, the
kids are saying that there will be
another prom. Somebody’s offered to
pay for it.
Who?

MRS. GREENE

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- INTERCUT
We see Emma, Barry, Dee Dee, Vera, Trent, Sheldon and Angie
gathering in the empty gym, decoration underway. INTERCUT:
EMMA
(excitedly)
This is so generous of you guys.

"The Prom"

113.
BARRY
Well, after you broke the Interweb
we had to do something.

INT. MRS. GREENE AND ALYSSA’S HOME -- INTERCUT
ALYSSA
Can we talk?
MRS. GREENE
I have a lot on my plate today,
honey. I’m supposed to show a house
at 3, but I may have to cancel if
this rumor is true.
ALYSSA
Things are getting really crazy.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- INTERCUT
EMMA
It was crazy! The number kept going
up. And then the Indiana Star
called, then the Washington Post.
And now they want me to go on TV,
which I absolutely do not want to
do. But they said it’s PBS, which
is like smart TV. Do you know Judy
Woodruff?
ALL
(ad-libs)
Oh yeah. She’s huge.
INT. MRS. GREENE AND ALYSSA’S HOME -- INTERCUT
ALYSSA
Mom. We need to talk about what’s
really going on here. We can’t keep
avoiding this. I love you, and the
stupid thing is, I think you know
what I’m going to say -MRS. GREENE
Stop it! I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but
this is not who you really are.
Whatever you’re feeling right now
is because of those people. They’re
putting these ideas in your head
and they’re turning me into someone
I don’t want to be. I’m sick of all
this. Come. We’re going to end this
now.

"The Prom"

114.
ALYSSA
No. I’m not going with you. I don’t
want to be any part of your shit
anymore!

Alyssa storms off. Mrs. Greene exits.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- RESUME
Hawkins enters the gym.
EMMA
Oh my God. Can I just say you guys
are the best middle-aged people I
have ever met?
BARRY
Hold up for a minute. We need to
talk. I think it’s important that
you know exactly why we came down
here.
EMMA
It wasn’t for the Hoosier pie?
BARRY
That’s delicious, but that’s not
what I’m talking about. Listen. We
got blasted in the Times. They said
we were narcissists. In a big, bold
font. And it hurt, I guess because
they were right.
EMMA
Aren’t all actors narcissists?
DEE DEE
Yes, but we were really good at it.
Anyway, we decided to look for a
cause to take on, you know, to give
us credibility. Maybe get us a
little good press.
TRENT
We thought about building houses
with Habitat for Humanity...
BARRY
...but we don’t actually know how
to build anything.
ANGIE
Then I found you on Twitter. It was
just dumb luck.

"The Prom"

115.
BARRY
So maybe we’re not the best middleaged people out there, is what I’m
saying.
EMMA
Well, sorry to tell you this but
you’re going to build something.
You’re going to build a prom.
Hundreds of kids like me are
coming. I think you got your
credibility.

Barry and Emma hug. At that moment -INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- CONTINUOUS
Mrs. Greene bursts in, followed by some PARENTS and STUDENTS.
MRS. GREENE
Stop this. Who gave you people
permission to be here?
I did.

HAWKINS

MRS. GREENE
You don’t have that right.
HAWKINS
I do, actually. This is a community
space -MRS. GREENE
You should have consulted the PTA.
HAWKINS
This is not a school event. I’m not
obliged to get the PTA’s approval.
BARRY
Listen to me, this Prom is
happening and there’s not a damn
thing you can do about it.
Mrs. Greene ignores Barry and goes after Hawkins.
MRS. GREENE
I’m going to make this as clear as
I possibly can. Your beliefs are
not our beliefs. I am proud of who
we are and if I have to sue you all
to stop this defamation I will. We
do not want this.

"The Prom"

116.

We?

TRENT

MRS. GREENE
This community.
TRENT
The young people, your children,
they are part of your community,
correct? Perhaps we should ask them
what they want.
All turn to face the crowd of students. Shelby steps forward.
She approaches Emma.
SHELBY
Emma, I was a jerk. I’m sorry. You
deserve to go to Prom just like any
other kid.
Shelby hugs Emma.
EMMA
What? I thought you hated me. I
thought you all hated me.
TRENT
Oh, they hated you all right. They
hated you with a burning passion
stoked by centuries of intolerance
and a lack of a drama program.
Kaylee joins Shelby.
KAYLEE
That guy from “Talk to the Hand”
really opened our eyes. I’m sorry
too, Emma.
(to Trent)
You explain things really well. You
should be, like, a teacher.
SHELBY
Oh! You should be our drama
teacher!
STUDENTS
(ad libs)
Yeah! Definitely!
The Students all gather around Trent.

"The Prom"

117.
TRENT
Really? Fair warning: I do tend to
pontificate...
KAYLEE
We could listen to you talk all
day!
TRENT
Then yes!
(as they cheer --)
Well, it looks like you don’t
represent the beliefs of everyone
in our community.
MRS. GREENE
(to the other parents)
This is exactly what I warned you
about.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL -- GYM -- CONTINUOUS
Alyssa appears at the door.
MRS. GREENE
No. Children are impressionable. If
we expose them to inappropriate
behavior they’ll... they’ll...
Mom.
Alyssa.

ALYSSA
MRS. GREENE

ALYSSA
You have to stop talking for a
minute and listen, okay? People
don’t turn gay. They are who they
are.
MRS. GREENE
You don’t know what you’re saying.
ALYSSA
I do. I know how you were raised,
but the world’s a different place
now. It’s not great, but it’s
better because of people who had
the courage to be themselves.
People like her.
(pointing to Emma)
I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t
want to hurt anyone.
(MORE)

"The Prom"

118.
ALYSSA (CONT'D)
I just want to be me. So here
goes...
(To Emma)
I love you, Emma Nolan.
Holy shit.

EMMA

The Students react.
TRENT
Class, class. Settle down, class.
MRS. GREENE
Alyssa. You’re confused. You’re
young and you don’t know -BARRY
(to Mrs. Greene)
If you don’t let her be who she is,
you’re going to lose her. You’re
going to lose your daughter.
VERA
(with emotion)
He’s right. Trust me. I know what
I’m talking about.
Mrs. Greene turns.
MRS. GREENE
I just don’t want you to have a
hard life.
ALYSSA
It’s already hard.
Mrs. Greene pauses.
Mom?

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

MRS. GREENE
(to Alyssa)
We’ll talk tonight, okay?
Okay.

ALYSSA

Mrs. Greene exits. PUSH IN on Barry, moved. A beat, he
follows her out. Dee Dee tries to rally the troops.

"The Prom"

119.
DEE DEE
Okay everybody...let’s make this
place pretty. We’ve got a prom to
put on.

As everyone busies themselves and Emma and Alyssa hug through
tears at her huge coming out moment, we DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY
Barry comforts Mrs. Greene, sings to her. Dee Dee comes up at
the end and encourages Mrs. Greene to support her daughter.
CUT TO:
INT. PROM -- NIGHT
The big finish. It’s really happening.
We find a REAR VIEW OF Emma and Alyssa, holding hands,
walking through PASTEL COLORED ROOMS of LIGHT. Pink, then
baby blue, yellow...it’s the most romantic thing ever.
As music swells they move together through a RAINBOW COLORED
TUBE OF LIGHT. It’s stirring, moving.
Finally, they come out of the light to reveal they are in the
INCLUSIVE PROM. They look up and around. It’s a marvel.
ALYSSA
I’m so proud of you. Look what you
did.
EMMA
I can’t believe it.
Holding hands they drift through the elaborate space. But
there are no people yet.
ALYSSA
I think we’re early.
EMMA
Yeah, looks that way. Wanna hit up
the punch bowl or -No.

ALYSSA

(beat)
There’s only one thing I want to
do.
The music begins. The LIGHTS DIM and a SPOTLIGHT finds Alyssa
and Emma in the middle of the gym.

"The Prom"

120.
ALYSSA (CONT'D)
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU, LET
THE WHOLE WORLD MELT AWAY AND DANCE
WITH YOU...”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“WHO CARES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY?
AND WHEN WERE THROUGH, NO ONE CAN
CONVINCE US WE WERE WRONG, ALL IT
TAKES IS YOU AND ME...”
EMMA
“AND A SONG...”
ALYSSA
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”
EMMA
“LET THE WHOLE WORLD MET AWAY AND
DANCE...”
ALYSSA
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”

They take a beat, there is a rustle of activity.
EMMA
I think our first prom goers have
arrived.
ANGLE: Dee Dee, Barry, Trent, Angie and Hawkins arrive in
their prom best. They are dazzling. They look around, amazed
at their creation.
DEE DEE
Oh my god, this is so beautiful.
(to the girls)
And look at you!
BARRY
(eyes welling)
You’re the most beautiful.
Everyone is in a wave of emotion, they all start to hug and
cry until Emma pulls away with a smile.
EMMA
Okay guys, let’s get it together.
ANGIE
Emma’s right, pull it together,
guys. Kids from across the entire
state are coming.

"The Prom"

121.
EMMA
So let’s do this right!
(then)
“ONE THING YOU'VE TAUGHT ME, IS HOW
MUCH PEOPLE ENJOY A SHOW, AND SO
YOU'VE GOT ME DEBATING HOW THIS
WHOLE NIGHT SHOULD GO...KIDS WILL
BE WATCHING, TO SEE WHO EVERY GUEST
IS AND SO MY ONLY REQUEST IS...”
“BUILD A PROM FOR EVERYONE, SHOW
THEM ALL IT CAN BE DONE, IF MUSIC
BLARES, AND NO ONE CARES, WHO YOUR
UNRULY HEART LOVES...”

We pan across our Broadway gang and Hawkins, all so emotional
at what they’ve pulled off and the friendships they’ve
created. Angie’s phone goes off, she walks away to take the
call.
EMMA & ALYSSA
“BUILD IT NOW, MAKE PEOPLE SEE, HOW
THE WORLD COULD ONE DAY BE, IT
MIGHT COME TRUE IF WE TAKE A
CHANCE, BUT TILL THAT DAY COMES, I
SAY CUE THE DRUMS, IT'S TIME TO
DANCE...”
CAMERA WHIPS to find LGBTQ kids starting to file in, along
with Shelby and Kaylee and Sheldon and everyone else. And
Barry’s Mom, all dressed up. Dee Dee grins, then turns to
Hawkins -DEE DEE
(to Hawkins)
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”
Barry races up and embraces his mother.
BARRY
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”
Angie comes back and joins the group.
Oh my God.

ANGIE

BARRY
What? What is it?
ANGIE
I just got the call. Tina Louise
has shingles! The producers want me
to go on as Roxie Hart!

"The Prom"

122.
EMMA
What did you tell them?
ANGIE
I said, “I have a Prom to go to!”
Atta girl.

BARRY

ANGIE
I was kidding. I’m taking the redeye tomorrow. Let’s get this party
started!
TRENT
“AND NOW WE’RE DRESSED UP...”
BARRY
“I AM A VISION IN SILVER BLUE...”
EMMA
“IT’S TIME WE ‘FESSED UP, THIS YEAR
OUR PROM QUEEN WILL BE YOU...”
BARRY
“MAYBE I’LL WEAR A TIARA, WHEN IT’S
“GO” TIME...”
BARRY, DEE DEE, TRENT, ANGIE & HAWKINS
“GET READY FOLKS, ‘CAUSE IT’S
SHOWTIME.. “BUILD A PROM FOR
EVERYONE, SHOW THEM ALL IT CAN BE
DONE, IF MUSIC BLARES, AND NO ONE
CARES, WHO YOUR UNRULY HEART LOVES.
BUILD IT NOW, MAKE PEOPLE SEE, HOW
THE WORLD COULD ONE DAY BE. IT
MIGHT COME TRUE IF WE TAKE A CHANCE
BUT TILL THAT DAY COMES, IT’S TIME
TO DANCE.”
Angie, Trent and Sheldon leave. Suddenly, we see Mrs. Greene
enter. She’s all dressed up and sparkly and beautiful. She’s
nervous, she’s really made an effort.
Dee Dee gets Alyssa’s attention, Alyssa turns and sees her
mother. Alyssa is overwhelmed, slowly moves to her mom.
ALYSSA
Is this a dream? Why are you here?

"The Prom"

123.
MRS. GREENE
There’s a lot to talk about. But
I’m here because there’s one thing
that matters to me more than
anything.
(beat, emotional)
You. You’re my daughter, and I’ve
loved you from the moment you were
born. And that will never change.
Ever.

They hug and everyone cheers. As Alyssa leads Mrs. Greene
over to talk to Emma, Hawkins spies a little CORSAGE station
now manned by Barry’s mom.
HAWKINS
What would you prefer? Gardenias or
orchids?
For what?

DEE DEE

HAWKINS
Your corsage?
DEE DEE
Oh. Gardenias. Thank you.
Hawkins starts to leave, then turns and gives Dee Dee a
romantic kiss. He exits. Dee Dee is completely smitten.
DEE DEE (CONT'D)
Don’t let me destroy him.
BARRY
I’ll do my best.
DEE DEE
So, is this what not failing feels
like?
BARRY
I think so, yeah. Pretty good, huh?
Yeah.

DEE DEE

Find Emma and Alyssa watching everything.

EMMA & ALYSSA
“THIS IS MORE THAN I DARED WISH
FOR, IT'S EPIC AND WHAT'S MORE,
TONIGHT THERE'S ROOM FOR ANYONE, SO
EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR! GET ON THE
FLOOR!”

Dance break.
ALL
“IT’S TIME TO BUILD A PROM FOR
EVERYONE, SHOW THEM ALL IT CAN BE
DONE, IF MUSIC BLARES, AND NO ONE
CARES, WHO YOUR UNRULY HEART
LOVES...”
“BUILD IT NOW, MAKE PEOPLE SEE

SAY CUE THE DRUMS, AND TAKE TO THE
FLOOR, THAT’S WHAT THE FLOOR’S FOR,
SO TURN UP THE BASS... UNTIL THE
WHOLE PLACE, GIVES INTO THE BEAT

EMMA & ALYSSA
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”
ALL (EXCEPT EMMA & ALYSSA)
“IT’S TIME TO DANCE...”
EMMA & ALYSSA
“I JUST WANNA DANCE WITH YOU...”
ALL
“IT’S TIME TO DANCE, DANCE! IT’S

Emma and Alyssa kiss. Everyone applauds for them as we -END FILM
