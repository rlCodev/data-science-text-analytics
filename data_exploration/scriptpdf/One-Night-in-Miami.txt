ONE NIGHT IN MIAMI...
Screenplay by
Kemp Powers

Based on his original stage play

A black screen. A TITLE CARD appears:
INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS...
We hear the roaring of a crowd, pierced every few seconds by
a loud THWACK that sounds like a wet-gloved punch landing on
an unguarded head. Every thud elicits a collective groan from
hundreds of voices.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The rain has stopped. The
excitement has really grown among
this forty thousand strong Wembley
crowd. It’s safe to say that every
single one of them is on Henry
Cooper’s side...
FADE IN:
INT. WEMBLEY STADIUM BOXING RING - NIGHT
CHYRON: 1963, WEMBLEY STADIUM, LONDON
A sweat-soaked CASSIUS CLAY, 21, dances around a flailing
HENRY “THE HAMMER” COOPER, 28, delivering punches to Cooper’s
face at will.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
And Cooper’s eye is opening wider!
It’s a shocking cut above his left
eye! He knows he’s got to get this
fight over with really quickly.
Clay is mocking Cooper!
Cooper takes several more desperate swings at Cassius.
Finally the sound of an end-of-round BELL sparks a muted,
collective APPLAUSE.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Clay raises his hands as he goes
back to his corner, the crowd
jeering him all the way. My
goodness, Cooper...
Cassius struts back to his corner, where he’s flanked by
ANGELO DUNDEE, 42, and DREW “BUNDINI” BROWN, 35. Bundini
removes his mouthguard, and Cassius immediately flashes a
megawatt smile. Angelo is irate, shouting.
ANGELO
Is this a joke to you, kid?!

(CONTINUED)

2.

CONTINUED:
What I do?

CASSIUS

ANGELO
Nothing! That’s the problem! We had
a fight plan...
CASSIUS
Plan?! Angie, look at him!
From Cassius’ POV, we see the opposite corner of the ring,
where Cooper sits on his stool, wheezing like he’s about to
have a heart attack. His trainers struggle to stop the blood
pouring from his forehead and eyelids. Back to Cassius.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
I’m beatin’ the shit outta that
tomato can!
BUNDINI
Damn right, he is! Rumble, young
man, rumble!
Right on cue, Cassius and Bundini lock eyes and, mouths
equally agape, let out an arrogant shout.
CASSIUS AND BUNDINI
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
Angelo isn’t amused.
ANGELO
If you’re not gonna put your guard
up, could you at least finish him
off?!
CASSIUS
I don’t want get too close to him!
If I get any more a’ his blood on
my trunks, my momma ain’t never
gonna be able to wash it out.
ANGELO
Nobody gives a damn about blood on
some boxing trunks!
CASSIUS
These is my lucky trunks!
BUNDINI
Your momma still doin’ your
laundry?

(CONTINUED)

3.

CONTINUED:
Shut up!

CASSIUS

ANGELO
Would you both shut the fuck up?!
CUT TO ringside, where two English ANNOUNCERS are discussing
the one-sided action.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
(sighs)
Three rounds in, and it’s not
looking good for Henry the Hammer.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
No it is not.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
This Wembley Park crowd was
expecting a better showing from
local lad Cooper against American
upstart Cassius Clay.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
They’ve been saying the Louisville
Lip’s theatrics overshadow his
actual skills in the ring.
ANNOUNCER #2
I doubt Cooper agrees with that
assessment tonight...
ANNOUNCER #1
Let’s just hope Clay can put this
bloke out of his misery soon.
ANNOUNCER #2
I think we may have all
underestimated Cassius Clay.
Perhaps he is as good as he says he
is.
Back on Cassius’ corner as the BELL rings. The REFEREE
motions to Cassius, who saunters from his corner.
ANGELO
Remember... finish him off!
CASSIUS
(defiantly)
I’ll finish him when I’m good and
ready to!

(CONTINUED)

4.

CONTINUED:

Angelo throws up his hands in exasperation as Cassius skips
to the center of the ring, where Cooper is waiting. Before
Cooper can even get his hands up, Cassius unleashes a
lightning-fast punch right into his face, to the collective
groans of the crowd.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
You ain’t got nowhere to be, do
you, Henry?
Each punch sends a combination of sweat and blood flying off
Cooper’s head as he stumbles back towards the ropes. As
Cooper struggles to recover, Clay dances around, prolonging
the punishment.
ANGELO
(walla)
Let’s go now, Cassius, let’s go...
There ya are... Move... There it
is... None of that... Hands up!
(to Bundini)
What’s he doin’?
BUNDINI
I don’t know, playin’ around...
Cassius glances out over the audience, a sea of ANGRY FACES.
Something catches his eye, and he does a double-take.
CASSIUS
That Elizabeth Taylor?
ANGELO
Keep your eyes in the ring! Get
those hands up!
Without warning, Cooper comes from below with a jackhammer of
a LEFT HOOK that nails Cassius square in his jaw. He slams
down onto the canvas hard, ass-first.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Clay took one chance too many, and
he still doesn’t where he is!
Angelo shouts words of encouragement, but Cassius doesn’t
hear them. Legs akimbo and arms tangled in the ropes, his
eyes are open, but Cassius is effectively OUT COLD.
From Cassius’ POV, even the bright LIGHTS above the ring are
blurry. As the referee’s hand slowly counts him out...

(CONTINUED)

VOICE (PRE-LAP)
I want you to imagine a man who for
twenty-five years of his life
arrived to work every morning at
nine o’clock. You could set your
watch by him...

CUT TO:
INT. COPACABANA NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Comedian MYRON COHEN is on the stage, performing his bit to a
capacity crowd of onlookers, all white and mostly middle-aged
or older. Everyone is smiling widely. They love this guy.
MYRON
...Then suddenly, one morning,
after twenty-five years of punctual
nine in the morning appearances,
not only is he late, but he doesn’t
look like himself. He has a big
lump on his head, two black eyes.
Bloody nose. Lip torn. Clothes
ripped and disheveled. His boss
says, “What in the world happened
to you?” He says, “Ooooh. Fell down
a whole flight of stairs, almost
got killed.” The boss says, “So
this took you an hour?”
The entire crowd roars with laughter at the punchline as
Cohen stands there, deadpan, drinking it in. Backstage, SAM
COOKE, 32, watches with a sour look on his face. By his side
stands his younger brother, L.C. COOKE.
Sam’s watching Cohen, but listening closely to the
conversation happening five feet away as JESS RAND, his
publicist, pleads with JULES PODELL, an intimidating hulk of
a man. Cohen’s jokes (and the crowd’s laughter) can be heard
in the background throughout.
JESS
Jules, work with us.
JULES
The Copa has rules. Band members
sit in the band-stand! Cliff’s not
dressed. You don’t even have a
chair for him! If your guy’s a real
singer...
SAM
Real singer?!
(CONTINUED)

6.

CONTINUED:
JULES
(smirking)
...then he don’t need no guitar
player on the floor with him.
JESS
My “guy’s” first single was number
one in America.
JULES
He ain’t had any hits in here.
(scoffs)
I never shoulda booked him. We
coulda had Mark Wilson in this
slot.
L.C. suddenly looks excited.
Who?

JESS

L.C.
The magician from “the Magical Land
of Alakazam”? I love that show,
man!
JULES
See? Even that guy knows, and he
looks like an idiot.
L.C.
Fuck you, man!
VOICE (O.S.)
Give it up again for Myron Cohen,
ladies and gentlemen! Myron Cohen!
We hear the roar of the crowd.
JULES
So, should I tell Myron to do an
encore? He’s the one these people
paid to see...
Jess turns to Sam.
Sam...

JESS

There’s a look of withering anger on Sam’s face.
SAM
All right, fine. Fine.

(CONTINUED)

7.

CONTINUED:
JESS
(to Jules)
Fine.
SAM
They better not fuck up my
arrangements.

We CUT back to the stage, where RONNIE the announcer stands
at the microphone in front of the crowd.
RONNIE
Next up, we have a young man coming
to the Copacabana stage for the
very first time. You all know him
from his hit song, You Send Me.
Ladies and gents, let’s give a warm
Copacabana welcome to... Saaaaaam
Cooke!
The band plays cheesy entrance music as Sam walks quickly
onto the stage, a big toothy grin now plastered onto his
face. He looks down and notices no fewer than half a dozen
couples abruptly rise from their tables and begin making
their way to the exits. Sam fights to keep the smile on his
face as he arrives at the microphone.
SAM
It’s great to be at The Copacabana!
How’s everybody feelin’ tonight?
A smattering of applause. All of the enthusiasm that greeted
Myron Cohen seems to have left with him.
SAM (CONT'D)
Um, I want to tell you that ever
since I started singing... Before I
knew I even wanted to be a
singer... Playing The Copa has been
a dream of mine. So thank you for
being here on the night that dream
comes true.
Another smattering of applause, only slightly more
enthusiastic. A few people cough.
SAM (CONT'D)
I thought I’d start off this
evening, uh... with something that
you all might recognize.
(turns to the band)
Boys?

(CONTINUED)

8.

CONTINUED:

Sam gestures to the orchestra, which begins playing a poorlyarranged intro to the song “Tammy.”
SAM (CONT'D)
(singing)
I hear the cottonwoods whispering
above, Tammy, Tammy, Tammy’s my
love...
A well-dressed WOMAN in the front row leans over to her
HUSBAND and whispers in his ear.
WOMAN
(whispering)
I liked this song so much more when
Debbie Reynolds sang it!
Her husband nods in approval as Sam continues. A couple more
people try to discreetly make their way to the exits.
SAM
(singing)
The old hootie owl hootie-hoos to
the dove, Tammy, Tammy, Tammy’s my
love...
Sam looks offstage and locks eyes with L.C. and CLIFF, both
shaking their heads in disapproval. Jess, meanwhile, gives a
sheepish two thumbs up.
CUT TO:
INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Sam sits in front of his dressing room mirror, seething. L.C.
and Cliff sit on a small sofa behind him, quiet as a mice.
The door swings open and Jess enters.
JESS
Boy, did really you bomb tonight,
Sam.
In a flash, Sam leaps from his chair and is nose-to-nose with
the shocked Jess.
SAM
Motherfucker, have you ever made a
quarter million dollars singing?
Sam... no.

JESS

(CONTINUED)

9.

CONTINUED:
SAM
Well I have. So until you do, keep
your fucking mouth shut!

Sam pushes Jess backwards out the door and slams it in his
face. He returns to sit in his chair. The room is once again
silent, until...
L.C.
He ain’t wrong, though. You did
kinda stink the place up tonight.
Sam chuckles.
SAM
Yeah, I did.
L.C.
(chuckling, to Cliff)
I told him not to sing that song.
He got all them hits and chose that
one...
Sam goes silent. He looks at himself in the mirror and takes
a swig from his glass of whiskey.
CUT TO:
INT. 1960S CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY
A scarred HAND with a large GOLD RING on the ring finger
rests on a steering wheel. A PULL OUT reveals the driver is
JIM BROWN, 27. He’s maneuvering the car down an unpaved road,
past the distinct willows and oaks the make it recognizable
as the American South. He slows the car as he approaches a
large, remote HOUSE, pulling to a stop in front of the porch
and stepping out.
EXT. ST. SIMONS ISLAND, GEORGIA - DAY
CHYRON: ST. SIMONS ISLAND, GEORGIA
Jim steps onto the porch, swings open the SCREEN DOOR, and
knocks. He lets the screen door swing closed as he waits.
After several seconds, the inner door opens, revealing EMILY
CARLTON, 20s, a young white girl in a sundress, on the other
side. She surveys Jim with her eyes, suspiciously.
EMILY
Yes? May I help you?

(CONTINUED)

10.

CONTINUED:
JIM
Yes, ma’am. I’m here to see Mr.
Carlton.

A look of recognition comes over her face, and she suddenly
lights up with excitement.
JIM (CONT'D)
Would you tell him that Jim Brown
is...
EMILY
Jim Brown?! Oh God, from the NFL!
JIM
(smiling)
Yes, ma’am.
EMILY
Grandpa! Jim Brown from the NFL is
here! And he wants to see you!
She excitedly shakes Jim’s hand.
EMILY (CONT'D)
Well I never...
Jim chuckles to himself. He’s accustomed to this kind of
thing happening. A BEAT, then MR. CARLTON, 60s-70s, steps
onto the porch, smiling.
MR. CARLTON
Would you look at who’s on my
porch! James Nathaniel Brown.
JIM
Hello there, Mr. Carlton.
MR. CARLTON
Don’t you “hello” me! Put her
there, son.
Mr. Carlton extends his hand. Jim is charmed and reaches out,
shaking his hand, firmly.
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
Come now, have a seat with me!
Mr. Carlton and Jim walk over to the edge of the porch, where
they sit down on a pair of matching patio chairs.
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
Can I get you something to drink?
Lemonade, maybe?
(CONTINUED)

11.

CONTINUED:
JIM
That’s all right. Thank you,
though.
MR. CARLTON
Welp, suit yourself. I’m certainly
having me some.
(shouting towards the
house)
Fetch us a couple glasses of that
lemonade, would you, sweetie?
(smiling at Jim)
Just in case you change your
mind...
Jim smiles and nods.
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
How long you been back on the
island?
JIM
I just got in last night.
MR. CARLTON
And you came by to say hello. How
thoughtful of you, Jimmy.
JIM
My aunt said you were anxious to
see me. I’m an early riser, so I
thought I’d come right over.
MR. CARLTON
The early bird does catch the worm.
But you already know that. Caught a
hell of a lotta worms this year!
JIM
(smiling)
I guess you could say that.
MR. CARLTON
No man who’s run one thousand eight
hundred and sixty yards in a season
needs to be so humble.
JIM
Actually, it was one thousand eight
hundred and sixty three.

(CONTINUED)

12.

CONTINUED:
MR. CARLTON
(laughs)
That’s more like it! That record is
going to stand the test of time.
JIM
You know, I’d happily give the
record back for a win over the
Packers in that last game.
MR. CARLTON
That Packers win is gonna be
forgotten by anyone who doesn’t
live in Goose Bay by tomorrow. Your
record is going to be remembered
forever.
JIM
I don’t see any reason why I can’t
get the record and the win next
time.
MR. CARLTON
Right you are, son. Right you are.
A beat. Both men look out from the porch.
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
Jimmy, I just wanted to let you
know if there’s ever anything I can
do for you, you should never
hesitate to reach out.
JIM
That’s mighty kind of you, sir.
MR. CARLTON
Our families go way back. Been
looking out for one another since
the first folks settled on this
island. I wanted to make sure that
I told you face-to-face that as
long as I’m still here, that ain’t
ever gonna change.
JIM
Well, my aunt will be very happy to
hear such a kind sentiment from
you, Mr. Carlton. Not everyone else
on the island has been so
supportive.

(CONTINUED)

13.

CONTINUED:
MR. CARLTON
Crabs in a barrel, I say. To hell
with ‘em all! I for one think that
you are a credit not only to this
community, but to the entire state
of Georgia. I’ve never been prouder
to say that I live on St. Simon’s
Island than I am now. And I always
make the point of adding “the place
where the great Jim Brown is from.”

Jim smiles warmly and shakes Mr. Carlton’s hand again. Just
then, Emily emerges from behind the screen door carrying a
TRAY with two glasses of lemonade.
EMILY
Here you boys go. Two lemonades!
MR. CARLTON
Thank you, darlin’.

Thank you.

JIM

She sets the tray down and each takes a glass.
EMILY
Sorry to bother you while you’re
entertaining, grandpa, but if you
could come move that bureau when
you have a moment?
MR. CARLTON
Sorry, I almost forgot...
Mr. Carlton rises from his chair. Jim follows suit. They head
for the front door. Emily dashes back inside.
JIM
You moving some furniture? You
should let me help you with that.
MR. CARLTON
That’s so considerate of you,
Jimmy...
Mr. Carlton steps inside. Jim, smiling, is about to do the
same, when Mr. Carlton stops him.
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
...but you know we don’t allow
niggers in the house. So it’s quite
all right.
Jim is stunned into silence. His mouth hangs open. Mr.
Carlton doesn’t think twice about what he’s just said, and
smiles as he turns to Jim one last time.
(CONTINUED)

14.

CONTINUED:
MR. CARLTON (CONT'D)
It really is wonderful to see you,
son. Keep up the good work. You do
us all proud.
As Mr. Carlton walks away, Jim continues to stand there,
silently, on the other side of the door. We also hear a
VOICE, like something one might hear on the radio.
VOICE (V.O.)
While city officials, state
agencies, white liberals and soberminded Negroes stand idly by...

CUT TO:
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
We now see the voice speaking is that of MIKE WALLACE, a
television news anchor, who stands in an empty newsroom
speaking directly to the screen. This is the news documentary
THE HATE THAT HATE PRODUCED --WALLACE
...a group of Negro dissenters is
taking to street corner
stepladders, church pulpits, sports
arenas and ballroom platforms
across the United States to preach
a gospel of hate that would set off
a federal investigation if it were
preached by Southern whites.
INT. HOUSE - QUEENS, NEW YORK CITY - EVENING
CLOSE UP of a black and white TELEVISION SCREEN, where the
Mike Wallace special continues playing. PULL OUT to reveal
the television sits in the humble LIVING ROOM of a suburbanlooking house.
WALLACE
For some time between now and 1970,
Elijah Muhammad, founder and
spiritual leader of the group, has
intimated that he will give the
call for the destruction of the
white man.
BETTY “X” SHABAZZ, 29, sits on a sofa, watching the screen as
the program continues to play.

(CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINUED:
WALLACE (CONT'D)
Here you will hear Elijah Muhammad
introduced by minister Malcolm X,
the Muslim’s New York leader and
ambassador at large for the
movement.

A massive Nation of Islam rally is on the television. MALCOLM
X, 38, walks over to a podium and begins addressing a crowd,
as ELIJAH MUHAMMAD sits in a row behind him, flanked by a row
of sunglass-clad BODYGUARDS.
MALCOLM
In the church, we used to sing the
song, “good news, the chariot is
comin’.” Is that right or wrong?
The crowd shouts its affirmation.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
But what we must bear in mind is
that what’s good news to you might
be bad news to another. And while
you sit here today knowing that you
have come to hear good news, you
must realize in advance that what’s
good news for the sheep... well
that might be bad news for the
wolf!
The crowd cheers.
BACK TO:
Inside the house. The lock on the front door clicks, and
Betty rises from the couch just as it opens and Malcolm X
enters. He looks exhausted.
BETTY
I expected you back hours ago!
MALCOLM
I know. I know. I got back as fast
as I could.
BETTY
Thank goodness you’re safe.
MALCOLM
Where are the girls?
BETTY
I put them to bed.

(CONTINUED)

16.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
(disappointed)
I promised I’d be here in time to
tuck them in.
(pause)
I’m really sorry.
BETTY
You can put them to bed tomorrow
night.
MALCOLM
Right. Tomorrow...
This remark gives Betty pause. She places her hand on
Malcolm’s face.
BETTY
Did you speak to him?
Yes.
And?

MALCOLM
BETTY

MALCOLM
Louis X said that if I decide to
leave the Nation of Islam, I will
be doing so... on my own.
Damn him!!

BETTY

MALCOLM
Betty, please. Don’t wake up the
girls.
BETTY
He wouldn’t even be in the Nation
if not for you! Let along running
the Boston temple?
MALCOLM
He remains thankful for my
mentorship.
BETTY
You told him about the Messenger’s
indiscretions? All of the
secretaries? All of the children?
And that didn’t sway him at all?

(CONTINUED)

17.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad...
BETTY
Don’t say “honorable”...
MALCOLM
(sighs)
...was his lure to the Nation. Just
like he was for me and so many
others. Imagine convincing someone
to convert to Christianity, then
telling that same person to leave
the church because Christ wasn’t
who you said he was.
BETTY
Louis could stroll right over to
any of the seedy apartments Elijah
Muhammad has those poor young girls
holed up in and see the proof of
his deeds with his own eyes!
MALCOLM
Perhaps Louis X just isn’t ready to
see that truth. Maybe none of them
are.
BETTY
(suddenly horrified)
What are we going to do now? The
Nation owns this house. The car.
Everything we have. The second they
learn about your plan...
MALCOLM
I’m hoping our friendship will keep
brother Louis from sharing our
plans with anyone else.
BETTY
You can’t count on that!
MALCOLM
I have to. I have to until I can
make other arrangements.
BETTY
What else can be done? You... we
are all alone if we go through with
this.

(CONTINUED)

18.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
For the moment. But I have one more
potential ace up my sleeve.
What?

BETTY

Malcolm doesn’t say anything, and simply smiles at Betty.
SMASH CUT TO:
TITLE CARD:
“One Night in Miami...”
INT. POOL -DAY
Cassius, clad only in his white boxing trunks, stands in his
fighting stance underwater, perfectly still. A sudden SPLASH
as a camera-toting DIVER plunges into the pool and quickly
sinks to the bottom.
CHYRON: Miami, Florida February 25, 1964
As the froth and bubbles clear, the photographer begins
taking photos. Cassius is the picture of grace as he throws
seemingly slow-motion punches underwater.
CUT TO:
EXT. POOLSIDE
POOLSIDE, where Bundini, Angelo, and FERDIE PACHECO stare
down into the pool.
BUNDINI
He can’t even swim! That boy gonna
mess around and drown.
Cassius and the photographer emerge from the pool. Cassius is
laughing.
BUNDINI (CONT'D)
You need to get on outta there
before you get yourself killed!
ANGELO
He’s right, kid. You need to get
your head into this fight.

(CONTINUED)

19.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
My head is into the fight, Angie.
Cassius pulls himself out of the pool and towels off.
ANGELO
You sat in on any more of Liston’s
training sessions like I asked?
CASSIUS
No need. Watching Sonny Liston
train is like bein’ at the circus.
He looks like one a’ them big, ugly
bears they have riding around on
tiny little bikes. All he needs is
an itty bitty hat on his head. He
ain’t no boxer. He’s an animal.
ANGELO
He’s an animal that can tear you
apart if you don’t focus. You make
the same mistakes with him that you
did with Cooper, you won’t be
walkin’ away from it.
CASSIUS
I won that Cooper fight, didn’t I?
FERDIE
You got saved by the bell! And he
woulda finished the job if they
didn’t stop the fight from all the
bleeding.
CASSIUS
Woulda, coulda, shoulda, didn’t. A
win is a win, Ferdie.
Cassius throws on his SHORT ROBE and FLIP-FLOPS.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
I’ll be back in a bit.
ANGELO
And where on Earth are you going?
CASSIUS
To check on Malcolm.
ANGELO
Oh, good grief...

(CONTINUED)

20.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
You got something else on your
mind, Angie?
ANGELO
Do I have to remind you how unhappy
the Louisville group is about him
being here?
CASSIUS
What they got to be mad about? I
been training hard as hell for this
fight!
ANGELO
Well, they’re the ones paying for
all of the training. They’re paying
for all of us. I’m just letting you
know, they’ve been giving me a lot
of grief.
CASSIUS
What business is Malcolm of theirs?
ANGELO
You don’t understand why a bunch of
white businessmen might be a little
stung by a guy who says they’re all
natural born demons?
BUNDINI
Mmm-hmm. That’ll do it...
CASSIUS
(chuckling)
He said devils.
Angelo isn’t amused.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Malcolm’s never been anything but
kind to you, Angelo.
ANGELO
I know, but the investors only know
what they see on T.V. And that
ain’t good, kid.
CASSIUS
They pay for my training. They
don’t get to choose my friends for
me...

(CONTINUED)

21.

CONTINUED:
ANGELO
Well, training’s what they want
their money going towards, not some
white man-hating demagogue’s
airfare.

Cassius is silent, trying to hold back the anger he’s feeling
over Angelo’s comments.
CASSIUS
What did the investors say when
they gave me my money?
ANGELO
(sighs)
That it was yours to do...
CASSIUS
(cutting him off)
...to do with as I pleased, Angie!
And if it pleases me to bring my
friend down to give me the
spiritual support I need to win
this fight, then that’s what I’m
gonna do. They want their money
back?! I’ll pay it back to all of
‘em with interest, after the fight!
Angelo is silent, unsure of what to say.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Now, if you all will excuse me.
I’ll see you back here in an hour.
Cassius walks off.
BUNDINI
He’ll be all right. You gotta have
faith in him. You gotta have a
little bit of faith...

Sam sits on his bed, strumming a GUITAR. The door to the

BARBARA
You got that right. He’s more

I don’t know why I went through all
the trouble of gettin’ this nice
hotel room for an old country gal
like you.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
BARBARA
(chuckles)
I didn’t ask to stay at the
Fontainebleau! I’d have been
perfectly happy over at the Sir
John with Cassius or the Hampton
House with Malcolm and the rest of
the Black folks like us.

Sam suddenly stiffens. And awkward silence. Barbara clocks
this.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
But I do like it here. It’s nice.
Sam says nothing.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
And... I’m glad I decided to come
down here for this, Sam. With you.
You haven’t sung to me in a long
time.
Sam looks down at his guitar and continues to lightly strum,
avoiding eye contact.
SAM
Yeah, I know it...
Barbara is about to say something else when the TELEPHONE
rings. Sam is quick to answer it.
Hello?

SAM (CONT'D)
CUT TO:

INT. MALCOLM’S ROOM
Malcolm smiles as he speaks into a receiver.
MALCOLM
Brother Sam.
BACK TO SCENE.
SAM
Malllllcolm!

24.
INTERCUT BETWEEN SAM AND MALCOLM.
Sam points to the phone with an “I’ve got to take this”
gesture. Barbara, obviously disappointed, returns to the
bathroom.
A wide shot reveals Malcolm is sitting in his hotel room at
the Hampton House.
MALCOLM
Is brother Cassius there with you?
SAM
Naw. He’s probably doing some lastminute prep for the fight. Why?
MALCOLM
Oh, I thought he might come by
before heading to the convention
center so that we might have a word
or two.
SAM
Have you tried Jim?
MALCOLM
Yes. Jimmy hasn’t seen him either.
SAM
Well, if he calls, I’ll let him
know you’re looking for him.
MALCOLM
I appreciate that, brother Sam.
SAM
I’ll see you at the convention
center.
MALCOLM
Yeah, I wouldn’t miss it.
Malcolm and Sam both hang up. Malcolm sighs, then looks out
his window.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE MOTEL
Cassius saunters through a parking lot and under a large SIGN
welcoming guests to the HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL.

25.
INT. MALCOLM’S HOTEL ROOM
There is a KNOCK at the door.
Come in.

MALCOLM

The door swings open, and brother KAREEM X stands in the
doorway.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Yes, brother Kareem?
KAREEM
You have a visitor, brother
Malcolm.
Cassius struts into the room. Malcolm smiles.
MALCOLM
Brother Cassius.
Malcolm and Cassius hug as Kareem closes the door, giving
them privacy.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I thought you might not be able to
make it.
CASSIUS
Hey man, ain’t no way I’m goin’
into that ring without my insurance
policy.
Malcolm walks over to the corner and pulls out a pair of
PRAYER RUGS. He unrolls them onto the floor. The two men
kneel together on the small rug and lower their heads in
unison. They begin to silently pray in Arabic.
During the prayer, Malcolm opens one eye and notices Cassius
is holding his hands incorrectly. He reaches out, and kindly
corrects his hand position.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
(embarrassed)
Thank you.
Malcolm nods and they continue their prayer...

26.
EXT. HOTEL BALCONY, POOLSIDE
At the same time outside the room, Kareem and the other
Jamaal silently, simultaneously conduct the same prayer while
standing.
INT. MALCOLM’S ROOM
Inside the room, Malcolm and Cassius also stand, their prayer
completed. Malcolm smiles as he pats Cassius on the back,
then rolls up his rug.
MALCOLM
You ready for tonight?
CASSIUS
I been training three years for
this fight. I’m as ready as a
person can be.
MALCOLM
Still, it might not hurt to just
tone down the rhetoric until after
the fight.
CASSIUS
Why would I do that?
MALCOLM
It may be easier for you to focus,
Cash, if for once the only person
gunning for your head is the guy in
the ring, and not the entire arena.
Cassius ponders this for a minute.
CASSIUS
You watch wrasslin’?
MALCOLM
Wrestling? I can’t say it’s part of
my daily viewing.
CASSIUS
I figured not. Well, my favorite
wrassler is Gorgeous George.
MALCOLM
Good-lookin’ fellow, I take it?

(CONTINUED)

27.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
In the European way, sure. Head
full of blond hair, teased up into
a nice ‘do.
MALCOLM
(sarcastically)
The crowds must love him.
CASSIUS
Naw. He preens and prances around
like a peacock, talkin’ all kinda
a’ smack. They boo him. They scream
at him. And the more they scream,
the more he eggs ‘em all on.
MALCOLM
So, he’s the villain?
CASSIUS
Well, sorta. Wrasslin’s kinda
complicated.
MALCOLM
Why would you model yourself after
a person everyone hates?
CASSIUS
Because everyone in that arena pays
a hundred dollars to see George
lose. The way I figure it, win or
lose the fight, George has already
won the war.
MALCOLM
(chuckles)
Well, maybe you fellas just like
going around with targets on your
backs.
CASSIUS
(slyly)
We learned from the best, brother
minister.
Touché.

MALCOLM

CASSIUS
I got you a ticket in the second
row, right next to Sam.
And Jimmy?

MALCOLM

(CONTINUED)

28.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
He’s doing commentary ringside. But
don’t worry. I already told all of
‘em after the fight we’re all
coming back here for the champ’s
victory party.
MALCOLM
And did you tell them anything
else?
CASSIUS
Oh, um. I didn’t get around to it.
I mean, I plan on...
MALCOLM
No, no. It’s all right, my brother.
This journey is different for each
of us.
CASSIUS
Thank you, Malcolm.
Malcolm smiles.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
I’ve gotta get back to my team. The
fight time is at ten. Don’t be
late.
MALCOLM
I won’t. Peace be unto you, young
brother. Peace be unto you...

CUT TO:
INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - FIGHT NIGHT
INT. BOXING RING
CLOSE UP on the face of SONNY LISTON, covered in sweat and
eyes swelling. A GLOVED FIST comes into frame and lands
squarely on his nose.
VOICE (O.S.)
Come on, sucka!
His heads snaps back, also snapping us into real time as we
pull out to reveal that Cassius has delivered the blow.

(CONTINUED)

29.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
Come on, boy! You gonna get that
whoopin’...

Cassius unloads a rapid-fire flurry of punches, one after the
other, each landing with a thud, thud, THUD on Liston’s head
as he backpedals to escape. He cannot, as Cassius plows
forward, throwing punches the entire way.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Damn, Sonny, you gettin’ uglier?
Cassius shoves Liston backwards, delivering a quick jab as he
does.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Take that with you!
Liston sidesteps, stumbling. He looks out into the crowd,
begging for help with his eyes. In the crowd, his wife,
GERALDINE, shouts up to him.
GERALDINE
Come on, baby! Give him that Liston
punch!
But Sonny can’t hear her. He’s lost. The REFEREE tries to
control the chaos in the ring. Cassius’ eyes go from Liston
and begin to scan the crowd in the jam-packed arena. In a
series of quick cuts around the arena, we see:
--JIM, sitting ringside behind a microphone among a group of
ANNOUNCERS, with a smirk on his face.
--SAM, his mouth agape as he sits next to Barbara, who is
also cheering.
--MALCOLM, in the seat right behind Sam, with a CAMERA held
up to his face, snapping a picture of this glorious moment.
While everyone around him is on their feet, Malcolm lowers
his camera and sits down, looking completely satisfied.
Cassius approaches the hobbled Liston, who has the look of a
wounded animal in his eyes. Even with his mouthguard in,
Cassius smiles wide.
The BELL rings, and Cassius winks at Liston before walking
confidently to his corner. Angelo, Bundini and Ferdie are
waiting. Cassius calmly sits on his chair.
ANGELO
He’s right where you want him!
Finish him off and take that belt
home!
(CONTINUED)

30.

CONTINUED:
BUNDINI
Stay on him.
Across the ring, Liston looks downright desparate.
BUNDINI (CONT'D)
He lookin’ bad over there. You got
him.
CASSIUS
I told you he was ugly. You should
see him up close. Oh man, he’s
ugly...
The BELL rings and Cassius stands.
ANGELO
Let’s go. Let’s go home...

Angelo, Bundini and Ferdie exit the ring, leaving Cassius,
bouncing with excitement as he prepares to charge Liston
again. He glares at Liston, who still hasn’t risen from his
seat.
CASSIUS
(muttering)
Go on and quit, Sonny... You ready
to quit... Then go on and quit...
That’s it, boy... That’s it,
Sonny...
Sonny spits out his mouthguard and shakes his head. Cassius
knows what that means.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
That’s it... Go on and quit, then!
Go on and quit, then!!
Cassius raises his arms in victory as his ENTOURAGE and
TRAINERS rush the ring and embrace him. The dejected Liston
sits in his corner with his head down.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
I’m the king of the world! I’m the
king of the world! I’m pretty! I’m
a bad, bad man! Hahahaha!
Cassius runs around the ring, pointing at the men in the
press box, taunting them. He then shifts his attention and
points down at Jim at the end of the press box.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
You see that, Jimmy?! Hahahaha!
Woooohoooooo!
(CONTINUED)

31.

CONTINUED:

From Cassius’ POV, we see Jim is now standing proudly and
applauding for his friend, a huge smile on his otherwise
restrained face, while the white ANNOUNCERS around him stay
seated with looks of shock and dismay on their faces.
The ANNOUNCER and fights through the crowd in the ring and
makes his way up to Cassius.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
That’s Sam Cooke! That’s the
world’s greatest rock and roll
singer. That’s Sam Cooke, he’s too
pretty! We’re both pretty!
Sam is ushered through the crowd and embraces Cassius.
SAM
You’re beautiful! You’re beautiful!
Sam leans in and whispers in Clay’s ear.
SAM (CONT'D)
See you at the Hampton House!
Still standing at his seat outside the ring, Malcolm smiles
widely and nods in approval. He snaps several more photos of
Cassius, surrounded by the crowd. Cassius looks over at him,
and Malcolm simply puts his hand over his heart. Cassius
repeats the gesture with his gloved hand.
CASSIUS
Malcolm! Ahhhh! I told ‘em! I told
‘em!
(to the reporters)
Eat your words! Eat your words! I
remember you, you picked him!

CUT TO: 23
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE MOTEL PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT
SAM tears into the motel parking lot in his car, screeching
to a stop. Sam leaps out of his car, carrying his GUITAR
CASE. KAREEM is in the parking lot to greet him. He frowns in
disapproval as Sam steps out of his car.
SAM
Is this where the party’s at?
KAREEM
Mr. Cooke. I’m Brother Kareem. The
brother minister instructed us to
let you in if you arrived early.
(CONTINUED)

32.

CONTINUED:
SAM
I’m the first one here?
KAREEM
That’s correct.
SAM
Me and my fast-ass cars. Heh heh.
(a beat)
So?
KAREEM
This way, please.

CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE MOTEL - POOLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
Sam and Kareem breeze past the hotel pool and up the stairs,
where they are met at the front door of the room by JAMAAL,
another identically-dressed Nation of Islam guard. The much
younger Jamaal smiles wide, somewhat star struck.
INT. MALCOLM’S ROOM
Kareem opens the door for Sam. The room is empty. Sam surveys
the environment, pretty unimpressed. The smile leaves his
face. He examines Malcolm’s belongings as he wanders around
the room. Just then, he looks up as we hear the jet ROAR of
an AIRPLANE passing overhead. It’s loud, causing the entire
room to rumble and the lights on the lamps to flicker.
SAM
(mumbling)
It’s a damn dump.
Sam abruptly drops his guitar case down on the floor, hard.
He steadies the case, suddenly a bit worried that in his
aggravation he was too rough with it. That’s when the
inspiration suddenly hit him. He quickly grabs a PAD and
PENCIL from his pocket and begins writing.
SAM (CONT'D)
(softly singing to the
tune “Put Me Down Easy”)
If you found somebody new, there is
nothing I can do, but ask you
tooo...Do it to me just the same...
Pause.

(CONTINUED)

33.

SAM (CONT'D)
(singing)
...as PILOTS do big
AEROPLANES...yeah...put me down
eeeeeeeeasy... put me down easy
baby... Don’t make it rougher and
don’t make me suffer just, put me
down easy...

Sam smiles as he continues to sing. The camera backs away
from him and out the window to Kareem and Jamaal, standing at
attention outside the room. Kareem is reading a BOOK. Jamaal,
is leaning towards the door, listening to the singing inside.
After several quiet seconds...
JAMAAL
You gotta admit, that brother sure
can sing.
KAREEM
If you’re into that sort of thing.
JAMAAL
Right, right.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE PARKING LOT
A large, LINCOLN pulls into the Hampton House parking lot.
The engine turns off and the lights dim. Kareem exits the
hotel and approaches the car. All four doors of the car open
simultaneously, and out from each pokes a well-appointed LEG
and SHOE before the figures behind each steps out of:
From the PASSENGER DOOR steps a smirking Malcolm.
From the REAR RIGHT DOOR steps a smiling Jim.
From the REAR LEFT DOOR steps a Jubilant Cassius.
From the DRIVER’S DOOR steps BROTHER JEROME 7X, another
sharply-dressed NOI guard.
Malcolm and Kareem share a brotherly embrace. Kareem then
leads the smack-talking men up the stairs. Cassius and Jim
are particularly loud and jovial.
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE MOTEL
Once inside, they head up the stairs towards Malcolm’s room.

(CONTINUED)

34.

CONTINUED:
KAREEM
Your... friend has already arrived.
MALCOLM
I’d assumed. His car is hard to
miss.
KAREEM
Yes. Well, we let him into your
room, as you instructed.
MALCOLM
That’s much appreciated.

The group arrives at the door to Malcolm’s room. A starstruck
Jamaal quickly opens the door.
KAREEM
Is there anything else you need?
MALCOLM
No, brother. We’ll be fine from
here.
KAREEM
God is great.
MALCOLM
(As he ponders the phrase)
He really is, isn’t he?
Kareem is somewhat taken aback by Malcolm’s less-than-formal
response. Nonetheless, he opens the room door and Malcolm,
Cassius and Jim stroll in. Jerome exits.
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE MOTEL - MALCOLM’S ROOM
SAM
What the hell took y’all so long?!
JIM
We didn’t run every damn red light
between the Convention Center and
Overtown.
CASSIUS
We told you to ride with us!
SAM
And leave my car at the arena
parking lot? Fuck that. Besides, I
had to drop off Barbara.

(CONTINUED)

35.

CONTINUED:
JIM
Was you sad, Sam? Sittin’ in here
all by your lonesome?
SAM
I don’t need y’all around to
entertain myself.
CASSIUS
We figured you’d have rounded up
some girls before we even got here,
boy! Where they at?
SAM
Shit, ain’t you too tired?
CASSIUS
Tired?! Boy, I’m energized! Was
before I even threw the first
punch!
Just then, a new idea hits him.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Can you believe they had the nerve
to trot Willie Pastrano into the
ring before the fight?
JIM
(Slapping Sam on the arm
playfully)
They say he boxes just like you,
Cash...
CASSIUS
Like me? Are you insane?!
SAM
(Also slyly, playing
along)
Willie Pastrano, that’s the
“dancing master,” ain’t he?
CASSIUS
Sheeeit. If he’s the dancing
master, than I must be the
motherfuckin’ inventor of dance.
Just ask Sonny!
JIM
(laughing)
You goddamn right...

(CONTINUED)

36.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
I am two hundred ten and a half
pounds of trouble, boys. And what
they didn’t know when they weighed
me in...was that a half pound of it
wasn’t even me.
JIM
What was it, Cash?

In an instant, Cassius jumps onto Malcolm’s BED and points to
the sky. Malcolm says nothing, but his face reads “aw, c’mon
man, not my bed!”
CASSIUS
It was a half pound of divine skill
bestowed upon me from God up
on high!
JIM
This motherfucker...
CASSIUS
They had Joe Louis on one side of
the ring, Rocky Marciano on the
other. Halfway through the 6th, out
the corner of my eye, I saw them
lookin’ at each other, like they
was asking themselves “why couldn’t
we do that when we was young?”
All three burst into laughter. Even Malcolm can’t help but
chuckle.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
I’m serious! If tonight don’t prove
God was with me, then nuthin’ does.
JIM
He sure as shit wasn’t with Sonny.
CASSIUS
You know Sonny a damn heathen. And
what do they always say, Malcolm?
The penalty one pays for avoiding
the path of righteousness is
walking whatever other path they
choose...alone.
Malcolm beams as he nods his head in agreement.
Yes, yes!

MALCOLM

(CONTINUED)

37.

CONTINUED:
Sam rolls his eyes.
Whatever.

SAM

CASSIUS
Cassius Marcellus Clay is the new
heavyweight champion of the world,
boys!
Cassius throws his hands up in victory and begins to spin in
a circle, Sam and Jim embracing him in a huge group hug.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
And I don’t even have a scratch on
my face...
From Cassius’ POV, he suddenly freezes as he catches his
reflection in a MIRROR and is shocked by what he sees.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
...Oh my Goodness!!
SAM AND JIM
What?! What is it, Cash?
Cassius turns and faces them, silent for a beat and
completely serious looking before he finally speaks.
CASSIUS
(Deadpan, sincerely)
Why... Am I... so pretty?
Sam, Jim and even Malcolm erupt in cheers.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
And I’m only twenty two years old!
There is no way I’m supposed to be
this great.
SAM
There he goes...
CASSIUS
Look, Alexander the Great conquered
the whole world at the age of
thirty. And I conquered the world
of boxing at twenty two, without
sustaining so much as a scratch.
You do the math.
SAM
All right! Where and when is this
party going down?
(CONTINUED)

38.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
That’s a good question. What’s on
the agenda, Malcolm?
MALCOLM
Well, I thought this would be a
wonderful chance for us to reflect
on what’s happened tonight. Like
our young brother said, there’s no
denying that greater forces were at
work.
JIM
You mean...no one else is coming?
MALCOLM
Rest assured, my brother, you’re
not missing anything.
JIM
But... I wanted some pussy tonight.
MALCOLM
It’ll be all right, JImmy. I think
you’ll live.
Malcolm pats Jim on the back as Sam shakes his head.
SAM
Malcolm, I did not give up a chance
to stay at the Fontainebleau for
this shit!
Malcolm scoffs.
MALCOLM
The Fontainebleau? Miami Beach?
SAM
Yeah. What?
MALCOLM
So you just walked right up to the
counter and booked yourself a room,
brother Sam?
JIM
Malcolm, relax...
SAM
Allen booked the room! Allen booked
the room...

(CONTINUED)

39.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
Allen Klein. The white man.
SAM
That’s his job.
MALCOLM
Oh, that’s his job? To tell the
other crackers that you’re one of
the “good ones?”
SAM
To do what I ask him to do!
CASSIUS
Could you two quit the
philosophical debate for five
seconds? Ain’t you just heard Jim
say he’s gettin’ blue balls?

Both Sam and Malcolm chuckle at this remark. It breaks the
tension.
SAM
All right. Do we at least have
something to eat while we
“reflect?”
MALCOLM
As a matter of fact, we do, brother
Sam!
Malcolm rushes over to the fridge. As he passes Sam...
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
(smirking)
Just because I'm militant doesn't
mean I don't know how to have a
good time...
Malcolm open the fridge, ducking down out of sight as he
looks inside. Sam and Jim immediately cut a simultaneous,
evil glare at Cassius.
CASSIUS
(whispering)
What I do?
Malcolm rises from the fridge, holding two tubs of VANILLA
ICE CREAM.
Ice cream!

MALCOLM

(CONTINUED)

40.

CONTINUED:

Yay.

SAM
(sarcastically)

MALCOLM
(smirking)
Just because I'm militant doesn't
mean I don't know how to have a
good time.
SAM
I don’t suppose you have any beer
in there?
Malcolm looks down into the fridge, self-consciously. He
hadn’t thought of that.
SAM (CONT'D)
Stupid question. Some chips then?
Chips?
MALCOLM
Um...I’m sure I can send one of the
brothers to get some.
JIM
Well, what flavor is it?
MALCOLM
Well, we have vanilla, Jimmy,
and...
Malcolm looks back into the fridge.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
...vanilla.
Shit.

JIM

SAM
(chuckles)
How is that for some irony?
MALCOLM
Last time I checked, vanilla was
your flavor of choice.
JIM AND CASSIUS
(mocking)
Ooooooooooooooh....

(CONTINUED)

41.

CONTINUED:

Sam respects this witty retort, as he turns to Jim and
Cassius, who both have an expression that says, simply:
“Damn.” Malcolm and Sam both laugh as Sam holds out his hand
for some “dap.”
MALCOLM
That’s right, jack...
Malcolm slides Sam some “skin,” an older dap that signifies
the generational difference. Sam just stares at his hand as
the pleased Malcolm laughs to himself as he returns to the
fridge to put one tub of ice cream back, before closing it.
SAM
Fellas, I’m just saying, why don’t
we at least go someplace hoppin’?
Fellas, the entire city of Miami is
celebrating Cassius’ win!
CASSIUS
They was all expectin’ to be
partyin’ with Sonny Liston tonight.
SAM
And it seem to me it’s not a great
idea your first night as world
champ starting it off by throwing
away all that good will?
MALCOLM
Good will? Good will from whom?
Good will from the press that threw
their support behind that thug,
hoping that he’d put our young
brother in his place? Naw, you’re
out of your mind, Sam. And besides,
part of the reason we’re here is to
celebrate Cassius’
official transition.
Malc...

CASSIUS

Cassius is shocked. He wasn’t expecting this to come out this
way.
JIM
Transition? To what?
MALCOLM
Shall we give them the news,
Cassius?

(CONTINUED)

42.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
Well, I suppose... If you wanna
tell them, Malcolm...
Jim and Sam look confused.
SAM
Now wait a second. You ain’t about
to say what I think you’re gonna
say?
CASSIUS
I’ve been thinking long and hard
about it, boys...and
I’m officially joining the Nation
of Islam.
Malcolm laughs and claps. Jim and Sam are in shock.
SAM
Cassius. Are you sure that’s such a
good idea?
Why not?

CASSIUS

SAM
I thought this Muslim jive was
somethin’ to rile up white folks.
MALCOLM
It’s no jive, Sam.
SAM
The cameras are off, Malcolm.
MALCOLM
He became champion on his own
terms, naysayers be damned!
SAM
We can’t all just go out and
declare the white man the devil!
MALCOLM
Oh? Why not? Huh? We’re entering a
new time. Where no one can hold us
back from voicing our honest
opinions! Jimmy hasn’t bitten his
tongue for one day of his career...
JIM
Well, you ain't lyin'.

(CONTINUED)

43.

CONTINUED:
SAM
Oh, so you agree with him?
JIM
Look man, I’m always in the hot
seat. But as long as I keep
winning, ain’t one fuckin’ thing
any racist poot-butt can do about
it.
MALCOLM
That’s right.
SAM
Well, if it’s such a great idea,
why don’t you become a Muslim too?
JIM
Sheeeit. Have you tasted my
grandmother’s pork chops?
Cassius erupts in laughter. Malcolm smiles as well.
JIM (CONT'D)
And I like white women, too. Fuck
that.
MALCOLM
Oh, you’ll see the light soon
enough, Jimmy.
JIM
Don’t need to, hanging around you.
Ain’t you ever heard of “guilt by
association”?
MALCOLM
Well, you already do have plenty of
nice suits. You given any thought
to switching from straight to bow
ties?
JIM
Malcolm, you ain’t never gonna
catch me dressed up as one of
your “soldiers of Allah.”
MALCOLM
I’ve already seen it, Jimmy! Those
pictures I took of you going to
practice, looking sharp as a razor?
The spittin’ image, Cash, of a
powerful, black Muslim warrior!

CASSIUS
I know it...
MALCOLM
A photo never lies, Jimmy. A photo
never lies. It alw...hmmm...
He suddenly stops talking, mid-sentence.
CASSIUS
What’s wrong, Malcolm?
MALCOLM
I just remembered, I left my new
camera in the car. I’d better go
get it.
Now?

CASSIUS

MALCOLM
Yeah, I just got that camera.
Annoyed, Malcolm heads for the door.
CASSIUS
Don’t sweat it, man. The bodyguards
have this whole place locked down.
They’d see anybody messin’ with
your car...
Malcolm quickly exits the room.
EXT. OUTSIDE HOTEL ROOM DOOR
Kareem and Jamaal greet Malcolm as he exits the room.
KAREEM
Is everything all right, brother
Malcolm?
MALCOLM
Yes, brother. I just need to get
something from the car.
KAREEM
I’ll accompany you.
(to Jamaal)
Watch the door.
JAMAAL
Yes, brother.

Just then, Sam runs over to door, opens it, and shouts out to
Malcolm.
SAM
What’s wrong, brother? Ain’t your
shit safe here in the black
community?
Jamaal stays at his post at the door, smiling at Sam. Sam
closes the curtain so no one can see inside. Kareem and
Malcolm walk towards the stairs.
KAREEM
Your friend is quite the truculent
one.
MALCOLM
Entertaining white people in the
south will bring the truculence out
of any black man.
CUT TO:
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM’S ROOM
Jim is comfortably laying back on Malcolm’s bed, trying to
ignore Cassius, who is jumping up and down on it. Sam sits in
a chair, looking around.
JIM
What are you, a giant fuckin’ baby?
CASSIUS
Man, I can’t help it! I’m full of
energy!
JIM
Well, this party’s off to a hoppin’
start.
SAM
I just know we are not fittin’ to

He's just lookin’ out for me, Sam.
SAM
He’s a big boy, Cash.
CASSIUS
Still, you ain't gotta antagonize
him...
SAM
He should be able to handle being
called out on his shit, especially
since he’s made such a name for
himself calling everyone else out
on theirs.
CASSIUS
Why you gotta push back so hard on
everything, Sam?
SAM
'Cause I'm a pushy motherfucker.
And I ain’t changin’.
CASSIUS
Oh, grow up!
You two...

JIM

Cassius comes down from the bed and goes to the REFRIGERATOR,
where he pulls out the tub of VANILLA ICE CREAM.
CASSIUS
You want some ice cream?

Malcolm and Kareem approach the car. Jerome 7X steps out of
it.
JEROME
Everything okay, brother?
MALCOLM
Yes, brother...

CONTINUED:

Malcolm reaches into the car and removes a beautiful
ROLLEIFLEX CAMERA. He admires it, then looks up and sees a
TELEPHONE BOOTH at the edge of the parking lot.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I should make a call while I’m down
here.
KAREEM
Is the phone in your room not
working?
MALCOLM
I prefer privacy when I speak to my
wife, and I’d rather not send all
of the fellas out.
Jerome and Kareem look at one another. Malcolm walks off.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I’ll be right back...
The men stay in position at the car.

INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM’S ROOM
Jim holds a small BOWL of ICE CREAM.
JIM
Know one thing that would make this
a little bit better?
What?

CASSIUS

JIM
Sam’s stash.
SAM
Fuck y’all!
JIM
Come on, man. Where is it?
SAM
Naw, no way..
JIM
(to Cassius)
Hey. Check his guitar case.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Sam is surprised.
For what?

CASSIUS

JIM
Just look, fool!
Cassius walks over to Sam’s guitar case and opens it.
SAM
You ain’t gonna find it.
JIM
I’ll bet you that cheap, purple
suit he will.
Cassius smiles, then pulls out a small FLASK from the case.
Sam rolls his eyes.
SAM
Don’t drink all my shit.
Cassius tosses the flask to Jim, who opens it and take a
nice, long swig.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE - TELEPHONE BOOTH
Malcolm holds the telephone receiver up to his ear.
Attalah?
Hi, daddy.

MALCOLM
ATTALAH (O.S.)

MALCOLM
Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing
up so late?
INT. MALCOLM’S HOUSE - QUEENS - NIGHT
ATTALAH SHABAZZ, 6, Malcolm’s young daughter, is on the
phone.
ATTALAH
You woke me up.

MALCOLM (O.S.)
Ohhh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to
wake you up. But I’m glad you
answered. Because I’ve got
something for you. Do you want it
now?
ATTALAH
(giggling)
Okay.
INTERCUT BETWEEN ATTALAH AND MALCOLM.
MALCOLM
All right, well I need you to get
down from the stool.
Attalah does as she’s told.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I want you to take three big jumps
forward.

Attalah obliges, taking three big jumps forward, stretching
the telephone cord to its limit. To her left is a small
BOOKSHELF.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Now look to your left. Now what’s
in front of you?
Books.

ATTALAH

MALCOLM
Books! That’s right. Now I want you
to take one of those books.
Which one?

ATTALAH

MALCOLM
It’s your favorite number.
Attalah thinks for a moment. Then points at the book furthest
to the left and begins to count out loud as she moves down
the row.
ATTALAH
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
She stops on the sixth BOOK and pulls it from the shelf. She
examines the book, then notices something dog-eared is
protruding from a corner.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
There you go. Now open it up and
take a look inside. You see it?

She opens the book at that places to reveal a NOTE. A CLOSE
UP reveals the note says “FOR ATTALAH” on it. She beams.
ATTALAH
(whispering)
Thank you, daddy.
MALCOLM
You be a good girl and you read
that to your sisters. Okay?
Okay.

ATTALAH

A bleary-eyed Betty enters the room.
BETTY
Attalah? It’s time to go to bed.
ATTALAH
It’s daddy.
BETTY
I understand sweetheart, but it’s
time to go to bed.
ATTALAH
Can I talk to him for a few more
minutes? Please?
BETTY
(sighs)
Okay...
Attalah turns her attention back to the call.
ATTALAH
Where are you?
CUT TO:
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM’S ROOM
Betty takes the receiver from her.
BETTY
Get to bed.

ATTALAH
But he gave me a note to read to
everyone.
BETTY
You can read it to your sisters
tomorrow.
Attalah exits, her letter in her hands.

Jim hands the flask to Cassius. Cassius considers it for a
moment. There’s a KNOCK at the door. Cassius suddenly stops
and puts the flask out of sight.
CASSIUS
Who is it?!
The door opens and Jamaal’s head and torso sheepishly lean
into the room.
JAMAAL
Can I get anything for you
brothers?
CASSIUS
Naw, man. We’re all good in here!
JAMAAL
Good, good...
After an awkward beat, Jamaal leans further into the room.
JAMAAL (CONT'D)
Say, champ. You don’t supposed you
could see your way to signing an
autograph for me?
CASSIUS
Uh, yeah. Of course, man! Come on
in!
He slowly enters the room, looking back to make sure Kareem
is away. He doesn’t notice Sam sitting in the corner.
JIM
Gotta make sure your superior
officer don’t catch you?
As Jamaal hands Cassius a small NOTEPAD and PEN...
JAMAAL
Oh yeah, brother Kareem can run a
pretty tight ship, but he’s
committed to

discipline.
JIM
Well, I ain’t never been a fan of
no tight ships!

The smile leaves Jamaal’s face. Jim immediately chuckles.
CASSIUS
Quit messin’ with the young brother
Jim! Here, give him an autograph!
Cassius hands the notepad to the smirking Jim.
JAMAAL
That’d be great! And actually,
champ, I’m a coupla years older
than you...
CASSIUS
Oh! See, I’m such an overachiever,
sometimes I forget.
Jim gets ready to sign his autograph.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
You know Jim Brown here is the
strongest man in the whole world?
JAMAAL
Oh yeah! See, I’m from Toledo. We
been watching Mr. Brown’s games for
years now! Actually, I almost got
to go to one.
Oh yeah?

JIM

JAMAAL
Yeah!
(pauses, thinking)
Naw, I ain’t have no money...
Somewhat charmed by Jamal’s innocence, Jim signs his
autograph as Sam flicks his LIGHTER, alerting Jamaal to his
presence in the corner. Seeing him, Jamaal quickly snatches
the paper from Jim’s still-writing hands.
JAMAAL (CONT'D)
Mr. Cooke! Um...if you wouldn't
mind?

(CONTINUED)

53.

CONTINUED:
SAM
Oh, sure thing, brother.
Sam smirks as he signs it. Off Sam’s arrogance...
CASSIUS
Hey man... Jamaal!
Yeah?

JAMAAL

CASSIUS
Mind if I ask you a question?
Sure!

JAMAAL

CASSIUS
You like being a Muslim?
JAMAAL
It beats being a purse thief in
Toledo!
CASSIUS
Yeah, I know that’s right. I mean,
but, was it hard? You know, giving
up stuff?
JAMAAL
I reckon so. I used to love me a
nice Champale every now and
then. Certainly miss my
grandmamma’s pork chops...
See?!

JIM

JAMAAL
...and it can be difficult, you
know? Like, the schedule...
Yeah...

CASSIUS

JAMAAL
I mean, none of that’s gonna apply
to you anyway!
CASSIUS
What you mean?

(CONTINUED)

54.

CONTINUED:
JAMAAL
I’m just sayin’, I don’t think
you’re gonna be spending any time
handing out pamphlets, is all...
CASSIUS
Yeah, I suppose you right.
JIM
Say man, do you have any regrets?
Regrets?

JAMAAL

JIM
You know. With hitchin’ your cart
to the Muslim train.
JAMAAL
Yeah. Yes, um, I think you could
say I do.
Cassius looks surprised.
Really?

CASSIUS

JAMAAL
I regret that I didn’t join up when
I was even younger.
Oh...

CASSIUS AND JIM

JAMAAL
This kid named Rollo used to chase
me home from school every damn day.
He’s the reason I stopped goin’.
Now I reckon if I woulda gotten
with the brothers sooner, we
coulda’ nipped it in the bud, and
put a foot in Rollo’s ass. Know
what I’m sayin’?
Sam's heard enough and begins heading for the door.
JIM
Yeah, you don’t need religion for
that, kid. You could’ve just joined
a gang.
JAMAAL
What’s the damn difference?

(CONTINUED)

55.

CONTINUED:

Jim and Cassius are surprised by this answer. Sam stops in
his tracks, turns to the others, and gives a satisfied smirk
at this revealing response. Sam exits through the front door,
taking a long drag on his CIGARETTE as he steps into the
night air.
JAMAAL (CONT'D)
Anyway, I better get going before
brother Kareem gets back.
We’re all proud of you, champ.
CASSIUS
Thanks, brother.
Jamaal exits as well. Jim, laughing at Cassius, takes another
swig of the whiskey.
JIM
Drink up while you can.
He hands the flask to Cassius again, who takes a swig without
hesitation this time. It’s strong.
CASSIUS
(coughing from the
whiskey)
Damn!

MALCOLM
He’ll be announcing tomorrow
morning that he’s a Muslim.
BETTY
Do you think he’ll go along with
your...plan?
MALCOLM
It’s too soon to tell. But... I
feel good about it.
BETTY
Oh, Malcolm. You were the only one
who believed in him. It’s only
fitting that you and Cassius be
blessed in this way. That you do
this thing together.
MALCOLM
I really do believe in him, Betty.
BETTY
He believes in you, too. As well as
he should.

CUT TO:
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM’S ROOM
Cassius is once again standing in front of the mirror,
preening as he admires himself. He takes another swig of
whiskey from the flask, then holds his arms up in a victory
pose. Jim looks around to make sure the coast is clear.
JIM
Hey, Cash. Can I tell you
something?
CASSIUS
Of course, man. Anything.
JIM
I did a movie...
(CONTINUED)

57.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
You produced a movie?
JIM
Naw, man. I starred in one!
CASSIUS
Well, that’s great, Jim! But,
you’re not an actor...
JIM
That’s what I told the cat who
wanted to cast me! But he put me in
his western anyway!
CASSIUS
Western, huh? Okay, so who do you
play?
JIM
I play a Buffalo Soldier! I’m part
of this special unit, and we’re
tracking this Confederate general.
He’s being protected by these
Apaches.
CASSIUS
Damn, that sounds pretty good! So,
you’re the hero?
JIM
One of ‘em. But my character gets
killed about halfway
through, so...
Cassius bursts into laughter.
What?

JIM (CONT'D)

CASSIUS
No, nuthin’ man. I shoulda known as
soon as you said “black action
hero,” the next part of that
sentence was gonna be “who gets
killed.”
JIM
It went well, man. I think there
might be a future for me in
this.

CASSIUS
Bein’ the sacrificial Negro in some
western ain’t the same as the
NFL, man! But how much you gettin’
paid to be in this movie?
JIM
(proudly)
Thirty-seven thousand dollars!
CASSIUS
Damn. That’s pretty good!
JIM
And it’s a lot easier on my knees,
too...
CASSIUS
Yeah, but...
(new idea)
...the only reason they want you in
that movie is because people know
you from football. You need the
game, just like I need boxing.
JIM
We’re all just gladiators, Cash,
with our ruler sittin’ up there, in
his box, givin’ us the thumbs up or
the thumbs down. Well I don’t want
no damn ruler. Shit, there’s only
so much running one man can do,
anyway.

Speak for yourself. I plan to run,
dance and fight well into my old
age.

Malcolm?
Yes...

Sam watches Sam as he finishes his cigarette. A smiling WOMAN
passes him.
SAM
Good evenin’.
WOMAN

Hi, Sam Cooke.
The woman rushes off and Sam approaches Malcolm, who is
wrapping his call with Betty. Malcolm steps out of the booth.
SAM
Hey. I was wondering what was
taking you so long to find a
camera.
MALCOLM
I had to check in with Betty.
Sam playfully makes a cracking whip sound.

Nah, she’s on her way back to Los

I... hope I haven’t unnecessarily
kept you away from her.
No...

SAM

Malcolm turns and looks out across the street again. Sam
notices.
SAM (CONT'D)
What you lookin’ at?
MALCOLM
Let’s make our way back to the
hotel, shall we?
Puzzled, Sam looks across the street and sees the two white
guys as well.

The sound of VOICES can be heard outside, which Jim

Why you embarrassed about it? It’s

Malcolm re-enters the room, followed closely by Kareem. Sam
re-enters right behind them. Malcolm is holding a CAMERA, but
he looks nervous, turning around to look out the window.
KAREEM
Brother Malcolm. Is there anything
I can help you with?
MALCOLM
No, Brother. We’re doing just fine.
KAREEM
Well, you know where I am if you
need me. God is great.
Yes he is.

MALCOLM

Kareem exits. As soon as the door closes, Malcolm walks over
to the window and slightly pulls back the curtain.
From his POV, we now have a bird’s-eye view across the street
at the two white men, who seem to be laughing to one another
as they finally begin to walk off.
JIM
What’s with him?
Malcolm ignores them, continuing to look out the window.
SAM
He thinks someone’s following him.
MALCOLM
You didn’t see those two white guys
across the street? I
know when I’m being watched.
SAM
How you know they wasn’t watchin’
me? Shit, I’m famous!

CASSIUS
This is what happens when you don’t
get enough exercise. Your mind goes
haywire.
Malcolm begins to examine his lamp, under his telephone
visually scan the room as he speaks.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Yeah. As a matter of fact, maybe
exercise is just what we all need.
What say we stretch our legs, boys?
SAM
Are you serious?
CASSIUS
As a heart attack.

A DOOR onto the roof opens, and Cassius, Malcolm, Sam and Jim

MALCOLM
I know when I’m being watched,
Sam...
SAM
Your paranoia is really crampin’ my
style, Malcolm.
CASSIUS
Come on. Just cause you can’t see
bugs don’t mean they ain’t in the
house, Sam.

Malcolm sits down on the edge of the roof, his legs dangling
over the side.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
It’s nice, ain’t it Malcolm?
MALCOLM
It’s most definitely soothing. The
air up here is...
(taking a deep breath, his
eyes closed)
...cooler.
SAM
Far away from the prying eyes of
your G-Men...
MALCOLM
Joke all you want, Sam. I’m telling
you, it’s gotten worse since the
tension between me and Mr.
Muhammad. I met with a writer in
New York a few weeks back, and
there were two guys following us
through the airport. I’d swear it
was the same two!
SAM
I thought you didn’t trust writers.
MALCOLM
This one was a brother, and this
meeting was important. I figure I’d
better start getting my life
story documented, in my own words,
while I can.
JIM

There’s been this feeling
permeating the air as of late.
Anger?

Well...Um...Jim is quitting
football to become a movie star,

Sorry, man! I had to do
somethin’ to lighten the
mood!

Holy shit, you are?

JIM
Hey man, I’m not quitting football,
okay? I’m just exploring other
options for after it ends.
SAM
I think it’s a great idea! You get

land of milk and honey, baby! We
can do whatever we want to out

Don’t need to! Got our own, black
Beverly Hills! And we got the

Malcolm holds the camera out as he explains. Cassius snatches
it out of his hand immediately.
Bee sting!

CASSIUS

Cassius begins to make off with the camera, Malcolm moving to
pursue, but Cassius cleverly hands the camera off to Jim, who
tosses it behind his back to Cassius, who catches it like a
wide receiver just before it flies off the rooftop. Malcolm's
smile turns to sudden shock at this toss, and he
transformatively "breaks character" as he shouts at Jim.
MALCOLM
Jimmy! What, you blew your
wig?!?!?!
The trio freezes, silently taking in what Malcolm just said
as they look at each other. Malcolm snatches back his camera.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Give me the damn camera! You lost
your mind? You know how much this
thing cost?
SAM
I think we done hit a nerve!
Malcolm done dropped the affected
speech and everything!
They burst into laughter. Malcolm smiles.
MALCOLM
Yeah, that’s right. I’ve got more
rep than all three of you clowns

Come on, man. Rep don’t carry over
from decade to decade! That tiredass 1940's slang you usin'.

Malcolm composes himself. He begins focusing the camera.
CASSIUS
Oh, he’s takin’ a picture!
The trio instantly strike suave poses.
MALCOLM
It’s a Rolleiflex 3.5. A German
twin lens reflex camera. A fine
piece of engineering, here. You
see, there’s this pop-out
viewfinder.
JIM
It looks bulky.
MALCOLM
No, Jimmy. It’s a work of art.
Besides, I’ve always got my Nikon
handy for taking photos on the
move.
CASSIUS

Like when you’re running from the
feds?
MALCOLM
Or riding on a camel.

see the Great Pyramids.
CASSIUS
That sounds fantastic!
MALCOLM
It will be! If your schedule
permits, you should join me.
CASSIUS
Count me in!
Yeah?

MALCOLM

CASSIUS
Count me in! I mean, fine African
sistas? Come on Jim, I know you’re
down with that.
JIM
With the ladies, most definitely.
But I’m up for another part.
Between that and camp, I won’t have
time for a trip to Africa.
MALCOLM
You should consider coming as well,
Sam. Leaving this country in the
rear view for a while is a great
way to get some perspective.
SAM
I’m busy too.
MALCOLM
One can never be too busy for some

SAM (CONT'D)
All right, fine. Maybe it was that
bad...
MALCOLM
You don’t shuck and jive enough for
those O’fay tastes.
SAM
I may not dance around the stage
like Jackie or James Brown, but
that's not what I'm sellin'. I'm
selling my voice, my words, my
image - my message.
MALCOLM
The problem is, at The Copa, you
have to sell that message to a
bunch of white folks.
SAM
That don’t matter! They got souls,
don’t they? And every living thing
with a soul can have that soul
tapped into. I thought you’d know
that...
MALCOLM
You think, just maybe, your energy
is misdirected trying to tap into
white people’s souls?
SAM
No, I don’t! If I win them over,
playing our music, I’m knockin’
down doors for everybody! You watch
and see. It’s not gonna always be
the pop charts over here and the
black music charts over there. One
day it’s gonna be one chart, with
one music, for all people...

MALCOLM
But what kind of message are you
sending, doing one show for white
folks, and a completely different
show for black folks? Or performing
in places where the only blacks not
on stage are the ones serving the
food?
SAM
Don’t you think I know that? I
can’t tell you how many times I
wanted to just reach out and punch
somebody.
MALCOLM
Then strike with the weapon that
you have, man! Your voice!
Black people... we’re standing up,
we’re speaking out. You have
possibly one of the most effective
outlets of us all, and you’re not
using it to help the cause.
SAM
The hell I’m not! I got the masters
to my songs. I started a label. I’m
producing tons of black artists.
Don’t you think my determining my
creative and business destiny is
every bit as inspiring to people as
you standing up on a podium and
trying to piss them off? Oh, wait a

MALCOLM
I do plenty.

Do you? Let’s see, you suck at
sports.
MALCOLM
Well, I was never much into
football...
SAM
You can’t sing. You damn sure can’t
make shit outta no peanut...
MALCOLM
Is there a point to this?

(CONTINUED)

71.

CONTINUED:
SAM
My point is that sometimes I feel
like you’re just like all the rest
of those people out there. Obsessed
with the stars.
CASSIUS
Whoah, now.
MALCOLM
No, let him finish!
SAM
Look around. Which one of us don’t
belong?
MALCOLM
The only person here that white
people seem to like. That would be
you.
JIM
Y’all need to cool it.
SAM
You know, you’ve always managed to
just be around for shit, haven’t
you? Maybe your daddy shoulda
beaten you better.
MALCOLM
That’s it, Jack!

Malcolm lunges right at Sam in a rage. Jim And Cassius hold
him back.
SAM
You can let him go! Let him go!
Just then, the door to the roof bursts open and Brothers
Kareem and Jamaal come rushing out. Kareem in the front,
Jamaal right behind him.
KAREEM
(Alarmed)
Everything all right, brother
Malcolm?!?!
SAM
What do you want?!
Kareem stops Sam cold with an unexpected STRIKE or SLAP that
sends him stumbling backwards.

(CONTINUED)

72.

CONTINUED:
SAM (CONT'D)
Get your motherfuckin’ hands off
me!

In an instant, Jim is standing between him and Sam. He stares
Kareem down.
JIM
Oh, I don’t think so.
KAREEM
Our job here is to protect the
brother minister.
MALCOLM
(dismissively)
I don’t need your protection,
brother.
JIM
Well... Now that that’s settled,
away you go.
KAREEM
Negro, I will leave when I...
JIM
You’d best think long and hard
before you wag that tongue at ME.
Kareem looks at the edge of the roof, considers this, looks
at Malcolm, then looks back at Jim. He smiles.
KAREEM
(with poison dripping from
his tongue)
God is great.
MALCOLM
Greater than any of us.
Kareem and Jamaal back out the door and exit.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE - OUTER CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
The foursome are walking back to Malcolm’s room, trailing far
behind Kareem.
JIM
Your security people are assholes.

(CONTINUED)

73.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
I don’t choose them.
CASSIUS
What’s wrong with you, Sam?! You’re
supposed to be smooth.
SAM
(mumbling)
It ain’t easy bein’ smooth with
this sandpaper nigga around...

They reach Malcolm’s room, where Kareem and Jamaal wait.
Without saying a word, Jamaal opens the door and they enter,
closing the door behind them immediately.
CUT TO:
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM'S ROOM
All of the men except Malcolm remove their jackets.
JIM
You two done fighting?
SAM
I wasn’t trying to fight nobody.
That’s Malcolm. Always pissed off.
MALCOLM
Pissed off? What’s going on around
us should make everyone angry! And
you bourgeois Negroes are too happy
with your scraps to really
understand what’s really at stake
here! You think Cash being the
world champ will protect him from
the devils that harassed him from
the first day that he got here?
CASSIUS
I’d like to see them try.
MALCOLM
And Jimmy. Jimmy is the best
football player in the world. But
he’s also giving money to blackowned businesses. You don’t think
that threatens a lot of white
people? You don’t think the FBI is
probably starting to follow him
around, too?

(CONTINUED)

74.

CONTINUED:
JIM
Oh, man, now you’re gonna fuckin’
jinx me.
MALCOLM
That is why, brother Sam, this
movement that we are in is called a
STRUGGLE! Because we arere fighting
for our lives. And what words are
we hearing from you, brother?

Malcolm walks over to a RECORD PLAYER and pulls out an LP.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
(sarcastically)
Mmmm. Mr. Soul.
He puts the needle on the record for a few seconds, playing
the first bar of Sam’s song, “YOU SEND ME.”
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Or maybe this one...
He lifts the needle again and drops it back down. We now hear
the first bar of Sam’s cover of the song “SENTIMENTAL
REASONS.”
Malcolm lifts the needle and turns the record player off.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Wow, Sam...your music is deep.
CASSIUS
Hey man, I love them songs!
SAM
You back never facin’ the door,
bean pie-eatin’, self-righteous
motherfucker.
MALCOLM
And, to boot, most of them are
versions of the church songs that
nurtured you. You twisted them and
you perverted them to feed a white
crowd.
SAM
That is bullshit. Most of the
artists I work with are gospel
singers. Do you have any idea what
I’ve given back to the church?

(CONTINUED)

75.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
How many times do I have to hear
that? That has got to be the
greatest fault of you so-called
“successful Negroes.” You’ll do
something detrimental to your own
people with the promise that, after
you get rich, then you’ll make it
back up to them. With a handout.
Some gesture of patronage. You’ve
made it, Sam, but for all the
others...the majority of
people...who had their own selfdestructive dreams and didn’t make
it, all they’ve left behind is a
legacy of negativity. But that’s
okay, because “they all meant
well.”
JIM
Malcolm. Would you please have some
damn ice cream?!
MALCOLM
And what you don’t get is that
you’ll never be loved by the people
you’re trying so hard to win over.
You’re just a wind-up toy in a
music box, or a monkey. You’re a
monkey dancing for an organ grinder
to them.

A long pause as his biting words shock everyone in the room
into silence. Jim’s eyes go wide.
JIM
(off the word “monkey”)
Wheeew.
He begins to exit the room.
JIM (CONT'D)
Y’all pulled out the knives. And if
I get cut, I’m fittin’ to hurt
somebody.
Jim exits. Malcolm turns to Cassius.
MALCOLM
Cassius, who were those English
boys you were hanging out with a
couple of days ago?

(CONTINUED)

76.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
The Beatles?
MALCOLM
Yes, The Bea-A-tles.
(Back to Sam)
All that time you spent on the
road, Sam, entertaining the
children of bigots, and at the end
of the day white folks’d still
rather import their popular music.
CASSIUS
Just hold on one second. The
Beatles. They’re funny, but they
ain’t no Sam Cooke. They’re more of
a fad.
MALCOLM
Well, if not them, then someone
else. The bottom line, this is too
important a time to be wasting a
brilliant creative mind on
pandering.
SAM
And it’s too damn hot in here to be
wearing that blazer. So what’s your
point?
As Malcolm continues to speak, CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM
Jim washes his hands as he listens.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
My point is that I am just one
voice in this struggle. Cassius is
another, who pushes us forward with
his fists and with his words. Jimmy
pushes us forward with his
relentlessness. His fearlessness.

Jim looks down at his battered hands in the sink, then up at
his own face.
MALCOLM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
But you, brother, could be the
loudest voice of us all!
B42

BACK TO SCENE - INT. MOTEL ROOM

MALCOLM (CONT'D)
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says...
SAM
Hold on. I ain’t ask what the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad thought,
I asked what you thought! There you
go with the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad says this and the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad says
that. But when the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad tells you to shut the fuck
up, you damn sure do that, too.
Jim re-enters the room.
MALCOLM
What’s going on between the Nation
and me is way more complicated than
that.
Jim clocks this, perplexed.
SAM
But you still obey them when they
tell you to come out here and
recruit Cassius to become a member
of something you don’t even seem to
believe in.
MALCOLM
I’m not making Cassius do anything.
He came to me for insight. He had
questions. His passion for Islam
comes from a pure place.
CASSIUS
Well, passion is kind of a strong
word...

Malcolm is positively shocked by this comment. Sam points at
Cassius to Malcolm, as though to say, “see?”
MALCOLM
You... couldn’t stop talking about
how excited you were to come out
with your faith to the world.
CASSIUS
True. True. I was. I am. It’s just
that...

(CONTINUED)

78.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
What is it?
CASSIUS
If we’re being completely honest
and all, I guess being Muslim
sounded like a much better idea
before tonight.
Jim chuckles to himself.
MALCOLM
(nervous)
How could you have any second
thoughts, Cash? You’re on top of
the world... I don’t understand.
JIM
He didn’t actually think he was
going to win tonight, Malcolm!
Cash...

MALCOLM

CASSIUS
(Uncertain of himself.
Nervous.)
Of course I knew! I’m the best
there...I’m the greatest there ever
will be...I’m...I’m just saying...
SAM
Easy, Cash. It’s okay...
CASSIUS
No, I’m good. I’m just a little
nervous, that’s all. That’s
natural! Ain’t it?
Malcolm just looks on, silent and a bit forlorn.
Malcolm!

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

SAM
It takes a hustler to see a hustle.
Malcolm is silent for several seconds. Cassius wanders off to
the corner and looks out the window. Sam is visibly disgusted
by this state of affairs. He turns to Malcolm.
SAM (CONT'D)
Let me ask you something, Mr. knowit-all.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

79.
SAM (CONT'D)
How is it helpful for black people
to run their businesses different
than everyone else’s? Dumber than
everyone else’s?
MALCOLM
No one’s accused you of making bad
business decisions.
SAM
You might as well have! You think I
don’t know about the British
invasion? I invested in it. I have
these proteges, The Valentinos. The
five Womack brothers. The youngest
one, Bobby, wrote this song. “It’s
All Over Now.” Great tune. The band
records it, and it’s fantastic. All
over the R&B charts. It even went
to number 94 on Billboard’s Hot
100. Then I get a call from
England. One of these British bands
wants to record a cover version.

Cassius turns around and perks up a bit.
CASSIUS
The Beatles?
SAM
No, Cash. They call themselves The
Rolling Stones.
CASSIUS
Like the Muddy Waters song?
SAM
Exactly. So, Bobby’s like, “no damn
way, man. That’s our song!” But I
get the final say, and I’m looking
at the big picture. And I give the
Rolling Stones permission to record
it.
You did?!

CASSIUS

SAM
I did. And the Rolling Stones’
version of the song goes all the
way to number one. Not on the R&B
charts, but the pop charts!
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

80.
SAM (CONT'D)
But, of course, once this version
of the song gets big, Bobby’s
version just disappears. Falls off
the R&B charts...it’s just gone. So
of course, Bobby’s crushed.
MALCOLM
Yes. As well he should be, Sam...
SAM
Let me finish! He’s crushed...for
about six months. Because six
months later, that first royalty
check comes in. Becaause Bobby’s
the writer, and my company owns the
rights to the song, that means
every time some white girl goes and
buys a copy of that single, she’s
putting money into my pockets. Our
pockets. Those white boys are out
there touring around, they don’t
even know they’re working for us.
Next thing you know, Bobby’s like
“the Rolling Stones wanna cover any
more versions of my songs?”

Jim chuckles and slow claps, snaps, or nods in agreement.
SAM (CONT'D)
You know who gets paid more than
the writer of a song that hits
number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100?
The writer of a song that hits
number one! I already knew that.
Now Bobby knows it, too. Tell me
how it’s not empowerment...
Everybody talks about they want a
piece of the pie. Well, I don’t. I
want the goddamn recipe.
MALCOLM
I congratulate you on being so
shrewd, brother.
SAM
You just don’t get how everything’s
not so black and white like
you make it out to be. In your
mind, President Kennedy getting
assassinated is just another one of
those white devils getting what
they deserved.

81.
SAM (CONT'D)
Well, I liked JFK, man. And my
momma cried when he died.
CASSIUS
Mine did, too...
SAM
How do you think it made me feel to
have her see my friend on TV
talking about “good riddance”?
MALCOLM
I didn’t say “good riddance.”
SAM
You said it was “chickens coming
home to roost.”
MALCOLM
I was trying to make a point,
brother...
JIM
You were paraphrasing...
SAM
I’ll tell you somethin’ else. My
whole family lives on the South
Side of Chicago. Not up in
Harlem where you are. The Black
Muslims...
MALCOLM
The Nation of Islam...
SAM
The NATION OF ISLAM is huge in
Chicago. I know where Elijah
Muhammad’s house is. It’s the
biggest one for miles around. Looks
like the mayor’s residence.
MALCOLM
Oh yeah, I’ve been there for
dinner.
SAM
So you see how he lives like a
Pharaoh? Never says nuthin’ about
the crooked black aldermen runnin’
numbers. Pushin’ drugs.

SAM (CONT'D)
Doing all those things to hurt the
community while at the same time
condemning those “devils.” Come off
it, Malcolm.

Malcolm just stands there, silently. He looks over at Jim and
Cassius, who don’t know what to say. Back to Sam, he smiles
and waves his finger, “tsk, tsk, well played.”
MALCOLM
I’ve got somethin’ for YOUR ass.
He walks over to his CLOSET and opens it. He pulls out a
SQUARE, FLAT PAPER BAG.
SAM
(Mimicking the “Dragnet”
theme)
Dum, da-dum dum!
(to Malcolm,
sarcastically)
Is that the clue that’s gonna solve
the crime, officer?
MALCOLM
You could say that.
Malcolm opens the paper bag and pulls out an LP. He heads
over to the record player.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I was thinking about this song I’d
heard on the radio the other
day. A song that made me think of
you. Turns out it’s pretty popular.
Malcolm places the LP on the player. He drops the needle,
then walks over to the corner and sits down, his back to the
others.
The song playing is Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind.”
Malcolm taps his feet to it as he listens to the lyrics,
smiling. He even closes his eyes every now and then and
grooves to it like he’s really into it.
Cassius and Jim look at each other, confused. After the song
plays for a while, Malcolm turns it off.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
I just love those lyrics.
Especially in the beginning.

MALCOLM (CONT'D)
“How many roads must a man walk
down, before you can call him a
man.” It’s as though he’s asking,
how much do the oppressed have to
do before they can be recognized as
human beings? Really gets you
thinking, don’t it?
SAM
I already know “Blowin’ in the
Wind,” Malcolm. I heard it when it
first came out.
MALCOLM
And it didn’t make you angry?
SAM
Why would it?
MALCOLM
Well, isn't this Bob Dylan fella a
white boy from Minnesota?
So what?

SAM

MALCOLM
This is a white boy... from
Minnesota. Who has nothing to gain
from writing a song that speaks
more to the struggles of our
people, more to the movement, than
anything that you have ever penned
in your life. Now, I know I’m not
the shrewd businessperson you are,
my brother, but since you say being
vocally in the struggle is bad for
business, why has this song gone
higher on the pop charts than
anything you’ve got out?
Sam says nothing.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Why. Has this song. Gone higher on
the pop charts than anything you’ve
got out?
Sam looks long and hard at Malcolm, seething for several
seconds before abruptly storming out of the room.
CASSIUS
Sam! Come back here, man!

Sam!

JIM

CASSIUS (CONT'D)
That wasn’t necessary!
MALCOLM
Yes, that was absolutely was
necessary!
CASSIUS
We’re supposed to be friends...
MALCOLM
I AM his friend, Cassius! That’s
why I’m trying to give him a wakeup call. There is no more room for
anyone, not you, not me, not Jimmy,
not Sam, no one, to be standing on
the fence anymore. Our people are
quite literally dying out there on
the streets every day! And a line
has got to be drawn in the sand. A
line that says, either you stand on
this side with us, or you stand on
that side against us. And I believe
in that brother’s potential too
much to let him stay over on the
other side!
CASSIUS
I’d better go get him before he
drives off.

Cassius quickly runs out the door in pursuit of Sam. Malcolm
stands there for several seconds, pensive. He obviously feels
kind of bad about hurting Sam’s feelings. After a few
seconds, Jim closes the door and slowly turns to Malcolm.
JIM
You know, I always find it kinda
funny how you light-skinned cats
end up being so damn militant.
MALCOLM
Huh?! What do you mean?
JIM
Well... You ARE yella as the sun.
And when I think about who the most
outspoken, consequences-be-damned
brothers are out there, it’s always
you light-skinned boys. You. W.E.B.
Dubois. Adam Clayton Powell...

(CONTINUED)

85.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
I’d never really paid much
attention to complexions, because
we are all black people.
JIM
Don’t suddenly talk to me like I’m
stupid. You know we are far from
all the same. When white folks
ain’t around, you see all the lightskinned girls gather in one corner
of the room. All the dark-skinned
girls gather in the other. And you
know, comin’ up, light-skinned cats
get it harder from other black
people sometimes than they do from
white people.
MALCOLM
What are you trying to say?
JIM
I just wonder if all the pushing
and all the “hard line” this and
“hard line” that is about trying to
prove something to white people
Malcolm...or is it about trying to
prove something to black people?
MALCOLM
That’s... a very interesting way of
looking at things.
JIM
Just something I noticed, that’s
all. I just don’t think you should
begrudge Sam for being about his
business. He’s got to be. If the
goal is for us to be free. To
really be free...
MALCOLM
You know it is.
JIM
Then the key is economic freedom.
And no one’s more economically free
than Sam. Shit, technically he’s
the only one of us not waiting on a
paycheck from a white man.
MALCOLM
I’M not waiting on no paycheck from
a white man.

JIM
YOU don’t have a job, Negro!
Malcolm is surprised by this comment.
JIM (CONT'D)
Shit. Well, in the literal sense.
MALCOLM
I know what you meant.
JIM
The one thing white folks are
masters at is tapping into our
passion to the point that we forget
about the important stuff.
MALCOLM
I thought you loved being the hero
of the NFL.
JIM
Hero? I ain’t no damn hero to them.
No. You see, some white folks
cannot wait to pat themselves on
the back for not being cruel to us.
Like we should be singing hosannas
because they found the kindness in
their hearts to almost treat us
like real human beings. Do you
expect a dog to give you a medal
for not kicking it that day? I hate
those motherfuckers more than the
rednecks who just put it all out
there. And I’ll be damned if I’m
ever going to forget what they
really think of me.
MALCOLM
I’ve no doubt that you won’t.
JIM
And the thing that I love about Sam
is that he doesn’t forget either.
And he does not deserve you
implying otherwise.
MALCOLM
I’m not implying... Jimmy, brothers
like him, you and Cassius. You all
are our greatest weapons.

JIM
We’re not anyone’s weapons,
Malcolm!
MALCOLM
But, you need to be... You need to
be for us to win.

Jim is surprised to hear Malcolm sounds nervous like this.
He’s even more stunned when tears begin to roll down
Malcolm’s face.
JIM
Hey, hey, man. Malcolm. Brother.
Talk to me. Tell me, now. What is
going on?
CUT TO:
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER
Cassius and Sam exit the Liquor Store and walk across the lot
to his waiting Ferrari. As they arrive at the car, a pair of
KIDS are excitedly admiring the ride.
KID #1
They got bread.

Oh, man.

KID #2

They rush up to Sam and Cassius.
KID #1 (CONT'D)
Y’all got any spare change?
SAM
Sure, kid. Hang on.
Cassius walks over to the passenger side of the car as Sam
digs into his pocket and produces a BILL.
SAM (CONT'D)
Y’all split that.
Grateful, the kid smiles at Sam before running off.
KID
Thank you! Hey, congratulations,

The kids both rush into the liquor store. Sam turns back to

Oh, Malcolm’s had it rough?!
CASSIUS
He’s getting worn down.

Cassius quickly enters the car to avoid further argument. Sam
throws up his hands, exasperated.
SAM

Oh for the love of...
Sam stops himself. He takes a deep breath and exhales the
anger. He throws his head back and closes his eyes.

Famous. Unapologetic.
Sam silently ponders what Cassius has said.
SAM
The target’s gonna be on your back.
CASSIUS
It was gonna be there anyway.
Sam is silent.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
This ain’t about civil rights.
Those activists ain’t do squat
about them four little girls that
got bombed in Alabama. That’s why
they preachin’ to a deaf
congregation. Cause they ain’t
giving black people what they
really want.
Which is?

CASSIUS
What you have, but take for
granted.

Power.

CASSIUS
So do I. And so do they.

Sam looks out to see the kids exiting the Liquor Store, each
with a handful of goodies. They’re both holding their heads
high, looking confident.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
Power just means a world where
we’re safe to be ourselves. To look
like we want. Think like we want.
Without having to answer to anybody
for it. After all we put in, don’t
black folks deserve that much?
The kids wave. Sam and Cassius wave back.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
We can do whatever we want now,
brother. So tell me, what do you
want to do?
SAM
I want...
(thinking, then smirking)
...I want to damn party.
Cassius smiles and rolls his eyes.
SAM (CONT'D)
I mean... Don’t you?
Yeah.

CASSIUS

SAM
So let’s go...
Sam fires up his engine, and his car speeds out of the
parking lot and into the Miami night, Cassius shouting out
the window the entire way.

party to the Fontainebleau!

We’re havin’ a paaaarty...
Sam laughs, but Jim and Cassius don’t move.
MALCOLM
You’ve obviously forgotten that
brother Cassius no longer drinks.
SAM
And YOU obviously haven’t smelled
his breath in the last hour.
Malcolm looks to the now shocked Cassius, who breathes into
his hand and backs away, mortified. Malcolm looks over to
Jim, who shrugs.
JIM
Hey, let it go, man.
A look of disappointment on his face, he turns back to Sam.
He decides to use a different tactic.
MALCOLM
(with compassion)
Sam, what is this problem between
us?
SAM
I DON’T got a problem with you. I

MALCOLM
You remember the first time we met,
Sam?
SAM
I’m tired of your questions, man.
MALCOLM
Is that a no?
SAM
Of course I do. Up in Harlem. You
didn’t even know who I was.
MALCOLM
I might’ve said that at the time,
but I knew who you were. A lot of
the brothers had been requesting
shifts outside the Apollo that
week.
SAM
Is that a fact?
MALCOLM
That’s a fact. And I understood,
because I’d caught one of your
shows in Chicago.
SAM
You’ve been to one of my shows?

No. I’ve been to five of them.
Including the one in Boston.

Malcolm smiles as he begins to tell the story.
MALCOLM
Well, at this show, Sam was playing
with Jackie Wilson...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BOSTON BALLROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
JACKIE WILSON is on stage, singing “Lonely Teardrops” to a
capacity crowd, entirely black. He’s dancing wildly.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Now, I was there to see Sam, of
course. But Jackie was the opener.
He was doing his usual routine,
shuckin’ and jivin’ like those
types do. Not really my cup of tea.
Jackie does an acrobatic series of spins as his number comes
wraps. The crowd would disagree with Malcolm’s assessment.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
But thankfully, it came to an end
and Sam was getting ready to come
on stage. I knew he was about to
class this joint up.
Jackie exits the stage to cheers. He passes Sam backstage.

(CONTINUED)

94.

CONTINUED:
JACKIE
(slyly)
Warmed ‘em up for you, brother.
Don’t fuck up, now.

Sam says nothing, fixing his collar as the MC announces him,
to the even louder cheers of the crowd.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Sam comes strolling out onto the
stage, and the crowd goes wild! Sam
steps up to the microphone and
wraps his hand around it.
CLOSE UP of Sam’s hand as his fingers work their way around
the MICROPHONE.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
You know how Sam does. He caresses
it, like one might caress a
delicate piece of crystal.
CASSIUS (V.O.)
Or a pretty little fox!
JIM (V.O.)
Or an NFL championship trophy!
MALCOLM (V.O.)
You want me to finish this story,
Jimmy?
JIM
Aw, go ahead.
Jim, Cassius and Malcolm chuckle.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Like I was saying. He caresses the
mic. Pulls it close to his lips,
opens his mouth...
The loud sound of feedback, followed by a crackling pop,
fills the arena as the sound goes out.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
The sound went out!
What?!

CASSIUS AND JIM (V.O.)

MALCOLM (V.O.)
Mmm-hmmm! How’s that for some bad
luck?
(CONTINUED)

95.

CONTINUED:
SAM (V.O.)
Bad luck, my ass!

We see a smiling Jackie Wilson dap the ENGINEER as he hands
him a crisp TWENTY DOLLAR BILL for a job well done.
SAM (V.O.)
Jackie was always the king of
sabotage.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Regardless, Sam was now stuck on
stage, with no sound, and a worked
up Boston crowd.
A lone MAN in the crowd begins to boo. Soon, others join in.
In the back of the room, we see MALCOLM standing with his
arms crossed, two NOI GUARDS at his side.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Things escalated quickly.
Various MEN and WOMEN in the crowd start shouting.
SAM (V.O.)
My band was outta there like some
runaway slaves!
Malcolm watches as Sam’s entire BACKING BAND gathers their
instruments and flees the stage.
SAM
(to his band)
Where the fuck y’all goin’?
BASSIST
We musicians, not bodyguards! Good
luck!
Malcolm’s guards, though stone-faced, seem concerned.
The band exits, but Sam continues to stand there, taking in
the crowd’s collective jeers.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
But Sam, he just stood there on
that stage, and I remember thinkin’
to myself “this young brother is
fittin’ to get himself killed!”
CLOSE UP on Malcom in Boston, as he glances over at one of
his guards.

(CONTINUED)

96.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
This young brother is fittin’ to
get himself killed.
CASSIUS (V.O.)
Then what happened?
MALCOLM (V.O.)
Something... something, amazing.

The roar of the crowd grows deafening. A BOTTLE hits the
ground and shatters just a few feet in front of Malcolm. He
looks to one of his guards and nods. It’s time to go.
The guard opens the rear door and Malcolm is about to exit
when he suddenly stops. The entire room has gone SILENT.
Malcolm turns back to see what silenced everyone.
He squints as he stares at the stage. He can see Sam
gesturing and swaying, but he cannot discern what he’s doing
or saying. He steps forward with his guards, into the crowd.
Suddenly, a deep GROAN reverberates from the front of the
room. It’s difficult to tell what the sound is, so Malcolm
steps more into the crowd. The sound gets louder and louder
as he gets closer to it (or, it closer to him?). His eyes go
wide, like he’s staring at an oncoming freight train.
Just like that, the wave of SOUND hits him. If he had long
hair, it would’ve been blown back by it. It’s the collective
chanting of the CROWD.
CROWD
Ooh, Ah! Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah! Ooh, Ah!
Ooh, Ah!
Malcolm smiles as he turns to his guards and sees that
they’re chanting, too. He starts to chant himself.
CLOSE IN on Sam, who is obviously singing the words to his
song, though the only thing audible is the chanting of the
crowd.
MALCOLM (V.O.)
I saw him up there, covered in
sweat, and singing to them. But in
the back, you couldn’t hear
anything except that chant. And you
know what?
BACK TO:

97.
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - MALCOLM'S ROOM
MALCOLM
That was good enough. Yes, that was
one hell of a show, Sam...
CASSIUS
That sounds like somethin’.
MALCOLM
It really was, Cash. It really was.
(to Sam)
Brother, you could move mountains
without lifting a finger. Listen,
if I give you a hard time, it’s
only because I think so highly of
you. You brothers are our bright,
shining future. I never lose sight
of that.
CASSIUS
Well, you’re part of that future
too, Malcolm.
MALCOLM
(apprehensively)
I’m flattered, really, but...
SAM
Taking the world on your shoulders
is bad for your health.
CASSIUS
He won’t have to carry it by
himself much longer. Cause we’re
gonna be in the Nation together!
Jim suddenly cuts Malcolm a knowing, concerned glance.
Malcolm...

JIM

MALCOLM
I know, I know.
CASSIUS
What is it?
Cassius and Sam both look confused.
Malcolm?

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

(CONTINUED)

98.

CONTINUED:

A long silence, as Malcolm inexplicably struggles to find the
right words to express himself.
MALCOLM
Like I said, my relationship with
the Nation has gotten...
complicated. And I don’t know how
much longer I’ll be in it.
SAM
You’re leaving the Nation of Islam?
I thought once you went in, you
were in it for life?
MALCOLM
I guess I’ll be putting that theory
to the test.
CASSIUS
Why would you want to leave? All of
the things you’ve told me. Things
you showed me that the Nation does.
MALCOLM
There’s lots of good, righteous
brothers and sisters in the Nation,
Cassius. It’s the leadership that
has shown that it’s not up to the
task.
CASSIUS
Wait...so you’re gonna help me
cross over to being a Muslim, then
quit being a Muslim?
MALCOLM
No Cassius. I’ll always be Muslim.
In fact, I guess you could say I’m
becoming more Muslim than ever.
CASSIUS
I’m not understanding.
MALCOLM
Well, I’m not leaving just to be
out alone in the world. I’m leaving
to start a new organization. One
that adheres more closely to the
honest, righteous tenets of Islam.
CASSIUS
Who’s going to be in this new
organization?

(CONTINUED)

99.

CONTINUED:
MALCOLM
I think lots of people will follow
me over, Cash. Especially... if you
come with me.

A long pause, as Cassius lets this sink in. Cassius looks
away, then looks back at Malcolm.
MALCOLM (CONT'D)
Say something, Cassius.
Cassius suddenly lunges at Malcolm.
CASSIUS
You motherfucker!!
Sam and Jim are horrified and quickly step in to hold him
back.
CASSIUS (CONT'D)
You’ve been using me?!
Malcolm looks Cassius in the eyes. Cassius’ expression goes
from rage to regret. Malcolm slowly rises, dusts himself off,
then picks up his glasses and puts them back on.
MALCOLM
No, no, brother. I’m trying to save
you.
Cassius lowers his hands.
CASSIUS
You’re the only one that needs
saving!
MALCOLM
If you don’t believe in your heart
that I’ve been an honest friend to
you, then you shouldn’t join me. If
there’s any part of you believes
our time together has been
motivated in any way by opportunism
or selfishness on my part, then
brother, I encourage you... alk
away from me with a clear mind and
conscious knowing it’s the right
thing... the only thing you can do.
There’s a long pause. Cassius looks like he’s about to say
something when suddenly a bunch of FLASHES erupt outside the
window, followed quickly by a series of KNOCKS on the door.

(CONTINUED)

100.

CONTINUED:
JAMAAL (O.S.)
Brother Malcolm! We got a bunch of
reporters out here!
JIM
There they are...
CASSIUS
Someone... must have saw me and Sam
downstairs.
MALCOLM
(a little shaken)
Well, you can’t blame them for
wanting a word from the new world
champion.
CASSIUS
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I’d better go
talk to them, help them sell a few
papers.
MALCOLM
Absolutely.
CASSIUS
You coming?
A look of shock on Malcolm’s face.
MALCOLM
I... I don’t have any comments to
make right now. Besides, they’re
here to see you, brother.
CASSIUS
I want you standing with me.

Malcolm smiles. He looks relieved to get this affirmation
from Cassius.
MALCOLM
Very well. If you brothers will
excuse us.
Cassius puts his hand on the doorknob. He looks down for a
moment, as though quietly putting on his “game face,” before
suddenly swinging the door open to the blinding series of
FLASHES and the gaggles of REPORTERS QUESTIONS being hurled
at him. He’s instantly in character and defiant.

(CONTINUED)

101.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
I TOLD YOU SUCKAS I WAS THE
GREATEST! (Pause) ALL OF YOU MUST
BOW!!

Cassius continues to hurl his over-the-top vitriol at the
crowd as he and Malcolm quickly exit the room into the
flashes. Cassius’ braggadocio-laced invective and the
questions die out as the door closes behind them.
Jim and Sam head over to the window and peek outside. The
flickering lights from the flashbulbs shine through the
window like lightning. Sam notices this and softly begins to
hum to himself before abruptly turning to Jim.
JIM
This is one strange fuckin’ night.
SAM
Yeah. You know, I know what’s going
on out there, right?
JIM
Yeah, Cassius... he’s out there
talking to the press.
SAM
Not out there, outside our room.
Out THERE.
Jim is obviously puzzled.
SAM (CONT'D)
I mean, just because I haven’t
released any records about the
movement doesn’t mean I haven’t
written any songs about the
movement.
JIM
Come on, man. You know Malcolm is
all fire and brimstone about
everything.
SAM
But when I first heard that Dylan
song, I WAS mad!
Why?

JIM

SAM
Because it’s fuckin’ good.

(CONTINUED)

102.

CONTINUED:
JIM
Good! You should feel competitive.
SAM
No, it’s not just because it’s
good. But... I felt like I should
have written that song. I’mcalling
myself “Mr. Soul” and I haven’t
written anything like that.
JIM
Why don’t you start?
SAM
I started working on something. I
started writing it the first day I
heard that song...
Really?

JIM

SAM
Yeah. But it's just so...different.
I haven’t even played it for a
crowd yet.
JIM
How does it go?
Sam stares at Jim, his eyes quietly asking “are you serious?”
CUT TO:
EXT. HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL - POOL
A throng of REPORTERS surrounds Cassius and Malcolm. A
growing group of black onlookers has also gathered, emerging
from their rooms and the hotel diner.
CASSIUS
All these so-called experts were
all wrong. Next time, don’t ask no
bookies who’s gonna win. You come
to me! I’ll tell ya who’s gonna
win...
REPORTER 1
Cassius, is it fair to assume that
since Malcolm X is standing here
with you, that you’re seriously
considering becoming a Muslim?

(CONTINUED)

103.

CONTINUED:
CASSIUS
I’m not considering anything. I am
a Muslim. And from this day forward
I no longer want to be called by
the name Cassius Clay. That is a
slave name.
REPORTER 1
What are we supposed to call you?
CASSIUS
You will refer to me as Cassius X.
Rumbling laughter amongst the crowd.

Jim and Sam emerge from the room and join the crowd taking in
this spectacle. They beam with pride at their friend.
REPORTER 1
Malcolm, have you been giving Clay
advice on his religious beliefs?
MALCOLM
He’s my brother and my friend. I
express what I know and understand,
but he has a mind of his own... an
understanding of his own.
Cassius turns and smiles at Malcolm, who returns the gesture.
Jim looks at Sam, who also smiles, knowing this is the right
thing for Cassius to do.
CUT TO:
INT. HAMPTON HOUSE - DINER - LATER
The diner at the base of the hotel is overrun with people.
Most of the entirely black crowd are jostling to get as close
as they can to the DINING COUNTER, where Clay, now decked out
in a SUIT and BOWTIE like a Muslim, smiles wide for Malcolm,
who is on the other side of the counter taking his photo with
his Nikon, also smiling. We hear Sam Cooke’s song “GOOD
TIMES” roaring as Malcolm takes one photo after another.
CASSIUS
(shouting)
Man, I’m so fast! I’m so fast that
after the fight, Miami vice tried
giving me a speeding ticket! You
take Sonny Liston, Joe Louis and
Rocky Marciano... I’ll whoop ‘em
all in the same night! You know I’m
the greatest! Who’s the greatest?!
(CONTINUED)

104.

CONTINUED:
YOU ARE!!!

CROWD

PULL OUT to reveal Jim and Sam blending in among the crowd,
sharing drinks. Sam sits off to the side, smoking a cigarette
and laughing.
CASSIUS
That’s right! Put that thing down
and come over here. Somebody get a
picture of us! I was in Rome! They
had a man they said could beat
me... I whooped him too!
Malcolm continues to snap photos. He looks up at the window,
and from his POV, we see that just outside the diner, brother
Jerome 7X is meeting with the two white guys he saw earlier
and handing them NOTES. The smile leaves Malcolm’s face as he
looks back at Cassius and locks eyes with him as we FADE OUT,
the music still going, until...
FADE IN:
INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW - NIGHT - WEEKS LATER
Sam sings the last few stanzas of the song “GOOD TIMES” for
the rapt Tonight Show audience. He finishes the song with a
flourish. Loud APPLAUSE from the audience as Sam strolls over
to the sofa and takes a seat next to ED MCMAHON. A smiling
JOHNNY CARSON claps enthusiastically.
JOHNNY
He sings well, doesn’t he, Ed?
ED
Incredibly well, Johnny.
SAM
(smiling)
Thank you, Johnny.
JOHNNY
Sam, tell us. How do you come up
with so many great songs?
SAM
Well, Johnny, I just observe the
things going on around me.
JOHNNY
What do you mean?

(CONTINUED)

105.

CONTINUED:
SAM
Well, if you try to see what’s
going on and try to figure out how
people are thinking and determine
the times of your day, I think you
can always write something the
people will understand.
JOHNNY
Would you mind singing us one more
song? Would you like that, folks?
The audience CHEERS in approval.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
Whaddaya say, Sam? Got anything the
people will understand?
SAM
I do have something that I’ve been
working on. Something new. I
haven’t really shared with anyone
yet. Anyone except...
(pause)
...some friends of mine.
JOHNNY
That sounds great. We’d love to
hear it!
SAM
All right, then, let’s do it.
JOHNNY
Ladies and gentlemen. Once again,
Mr. Sam Cooke!

The crowd CHEERS again as Sam walks back over to the
microphone. He looks out over the faces in the audience. He
slowly begins to sing.
SAM
(singing)
I was...born by the river. In a
little old tent. And just like the
river, I’ve been runnin’. Ever
since. It’s been a loooong, a long
time comin’, but I know a change is
gonna come. Oh yes it will...
The band cautiously joins in as we CUT TO:

106.
INT. NATION OF ISLAM MOSQUE - DAY
Elijah Muhammad welcomes Cassius to a podium in front of a
huge crowd of NATION OF ISLAM onlookers. Cassius, now wearing
the trademark SUIT and BOWTIE of the Nation, smiles and waves
to the crowd.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
The world champion, will no longer
be known as Cassius Clay. He will
be known as, Muhammad Ali!
SAM (V.O.)
(singing)
It’s been too hard livin’, but I’m
afraid to die. Cause I don’t know
what’s up there, beyond the sky.
It’s been a long, long time comin’,
but I know a change is gonna come.
Oh yes, it will.
The large assemblage CHEERS for Muhammad Ali, who smiles and
waves at the crowd. CLOSE UP of his face as the smile slowly
vanishes as his thoughts turn to Malcolm. He looks back at
the SEAT where Malcolm likely would have been sitting, then
turns back to the crowd and continues waving, now solemnly.
CUT TO:
EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - QUEENS
A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL flies through the air and crashes into
walls. PULL OUT to reveal it is the wooden walls of a house
as it is being firebombed. As the flames rapidly spread, the
FRONT DOOR swings open and Betty, Malcolm and their young
daughters come running out into the street. Malcolm is in his
robe and holding a RIFLE. They get to the front lawn. Betty
and the girls are in tears. All they can do is watch it burn.
SAM (V.O.)
(singing)
I go to the movies and I go
downtown. Somebody keep tellin' me
don't hang around. It's been a
long, a long time coming, but I
know a change gonna come. Oh yes it
will.
CUT TO:

107.
EXT. DIRTY DOZEN SET - DAY
Jim sits at a DESK in front of a crowd of REPORTERS.
JIM
Because my filming schedule
conflicts with Cleveland Browns
training camp, and since the Browns
have said there is no option for me
to return to camp late without
incurring hefty fines, effective
immediately, I am retiring from the
NFL to pursue my movie career fulltime. Now if y’all will excuse me,
I have to get back to work.
Hands shoot up to ask Jim questions. Jim smiles as he
confidently walks off. Sam’s voice is more confident now, the
band’s accompaniment gets even more robust.
CUT TO:
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
Betty and Malcolm’s daughters laying in a single large bed.
The girls are asleep. Malcolm sits nearby at a desk, a
sleeping Attalah on his lap. He’s in deep thought.
SAM (V.O.)
(singing)
Then I go to my brother. And I say
brother, help me please.
Betty rises from the bed. She smiles at him. He kisses
Attalah on the head, then returns the smile.
SAM (V.O.)
And he winds up knockin me, back
down on my knees, welllllllll.
Malcolm then looks over at a thick MANUSCRIPT sitting on his
desk. A CLOSE UP of the manuscript reveals the title: THE
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, AS TOLD TO ALEX HALEY. He taps
the cover of the manuscript and sighs in relief, knowing his
legacy will go on regardless of what happens to him.
CUT TO:

BACK TO SCENE.

(CONTINUED)

108.

CONTINUED:

SLOW ZOOM in on a CLOSE UP of Sam’s face as he sings the last
refrain, tears now streaming down his cheeks.
SAM
(singing)
There’s been times that I thought,
I wouldn’t last for long. But now I
think I’m able to carry on. It’s
been a long, long time comin’, but
I know a change is gonna come. Oh
yes it will...
MATCH CUT TO:
A TELEVISION SCREEN, as Sam discreetly wipes a tear from his
eye and bows for the silent audience.
PULL OUT to reveal Malcolm watching the television from his
chair in his hotel room. He takes a deep, satisfied breath,
then closes his eyes.
SMASH CUT TO BLACK SCREEN.
SUPER:
“It is a time for martyrs now, and if I am to be one, it will
be for the cause of brotherhood. That’s the only thing that
can save this country.”
Malcolm X, February 19, 1965
He was murdered two days later.
END.
