20 year-old DANIEL HORDERN stands at the sink of a neat
bathroom, his face covered in shaving foam.
DANIEL

Mum!
He dips his blade in the basin and drags it across his cheek. He
winces in pain.
DANIEL

Mum!
GAIL HORDERN appears in the doorway.
GAIL
What's the matter?
DANIEL
Where's dad's razor?
GAIL
What for?
DANIEL
Mine's blunt. I'm gonna be late for
work.
GAIL
Don't you have spare ones?
DANIEL
Where's dad's?

Daniel is on patrol with Peter. Peter drives. It's late. The
radio crackles. They sit in silence a while.
DANIEL
She's leaving messages on the machine
now at, like, three in the morning and
mum's, like, screaming at me to get
her to stop, but you know, yeah, but
how?
PETER
She'll quit it eventually. She'll get
bored.
DANIEL
Maybe. I dunno if crazy people get
bored. You know what I mean?
The radio crackles. OVER comes the male voice of police radio
communications centre VKC (D-24).
VKC (D-24)

DANIEL
49. We’re heading west on Bridge Road
towards Church.
VKC (D-24)
49, Boroondara's units are all tied up
at present. Can you head over to 48
Darcy Street in Hawthorn? A Mrs Burnie
of that address has reported a white
Commodore sedan in the middle of the
road. Says it looks abandoned, windows
are smashed.
DANIEL
49. Roger. We'll give it a look.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

Daniel and Peter pull up behind the white sedan in a quiet
neighbourhood. They get out to inspect. Their radios crackle.
They head to the driver's side. Peter shines his torch through
the broken window, then opens the door. He shines the torch
under the steering column. Wires dangle. He climbs in the front
seat and shines the torch around the floor of the car. Daniel
crouches on the road beside him.
A SHOTGUN BLAST rips into Daniel's head. Peter spins, splattered
with blood and flesh. Semi-blinded he dives out of the car in an
attempt to grab the assailant. A blast rings out, hitting him in
the body.
Another blast echoes down the street. Three figures in the
darkness sprint from the scene. A light goes on in a
neighbouring apartment block. The street is still.

A young POLICE OFFICER crouches before J who is sitting on the
couch, numb. A few people mill around behind them.
POLICE OFFICER
Is there somewhere you can go tonight?
J
Yeah.
She pulls a card from her work folder.
POLICE OFFICER
If you need any help, you can give
these people a call. There'll be a
range of services they can provide
that you might find helpful. OK?
J nods, blank. She smiles, stands and begins talking loudly to
someone off screen. J stares at the card.
POLICE OFFICER
Alright, I'm gonna head over to that
one in Caulfield before the traffic
hits.

good. Um, Mum's gone and OD'd and
she's died and so [...] Yeah, I'm OK.

didn't say anything about, you know,
like am I supposed to organise the
funeral and that? I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do now, with the

J sits on the couch with two bags packed beside him. Hearing a
noise, he get up, opens the door and watches JANINE 'SMURF' CODY
(57) climb the stairs. She sees J. She bends over, out of
breath.
SMURF
Puffed... Have you got your bags,
sweetie?
J goes to her. She holds him.

A single-storey, exposed brick, early-70s house. It is flatroofed and semi-buried in lush, but overgrown garden, almost
like a bunker obscured from neighbours and the street.

INT. KITCHEN / CODY HOUSE - DAY

13

Two men sit at a kitchen table. BARRY 'BAZ' BROWN (35) is
counting a sizeable wad of cash, stacking it in front of him.
He counts the money into three piles. Opposite sits DARREN CODY
(22) in designer T-shirt, sunglasses on his head. Smurf is at
the bench stuffing fruit into a juicer.
BAZ
Nine-four.
He wraps elastic around the pile and hands it to Darren.
DARREN
Twenty minutes work. No shots fired.
BAZ
Three weeks prep. This is getting

No. I know where he is, but I haven't

SMURF
Where is he staying?
BAZ
I told him I wouldn't tell anyone.
SMURF
He's my son.
BAZ
(smiling)
I told him I wouldn't tell anyone. He
was really specific about the 'anyone'
part.
J appears in the doorway in an over-sized T-shirt. The men look
up, startled. Baz gathers the money and packs it in a bag
quickly, but calmly. Darren shoves his in his man-purse.
Smurf turns. J smiles, shy and hesitant.
SMURF
Morning, baby.
J
Hi. Hi, Uncle Darren.
DARREN
Seriously. Stop calling me uncle. It's
giving me the creeps.
Baz sticks his hand out. J shakes it.
BAZ
You want juice? Smurf's juicing.
SMURF
Apple and pear, hon. It's good.
Baz pushes a chair out for J. J sits.
BAZ
How old are you now? I'm gonna guess.
Show us your muscles. Do like this.

Baz flexes his biceps. J does likewise, unsure of himself. J
looks to Darren who sits impassive.
BAZ
OK, now sing the alphabet.
J
I'm seventeen.
Smurf starts up the JUICER. It's LOUD. The boys wait for it to
stop. Noise stops. Smurf pours the juice into a glass.
She looks close at it as she puts the glass before J.
SMURF
Look at that. It looks like an apple
milkshake.
CRAIG CODY (27) enters, agitated, shirtless, tattooed. He
carries a small chainsaw and drags a Doberman by its collar.
SMURF
What are you doing, love?
CRAIG
What's it look like?
Craig exits. Smurf starts the BLENDER. Baz laughs. J smiles.
DARREN
What the fuck, mum?
Craig bursts back into the room.
CRAIG
What the fuck's going on!?
Smurf switches off the juicer and pours juice into a glass.
CRAIG
Who said you could bring that noise
thing in my house?
SMURF
It's yours, love. It lives under your
sink. You want a juice?
CRAIG
Bullshit it's mine.
SMURF
It is. I found it under there.

Craig unplugs the juicer, stuffs it under his arm and storms
out. Smurf puts juice in front of Darren. The sound of the
juicer SMASHING on cement outside can be heard. J flinches.
Darren smiles. Craig bursts back through the kitchen.
SMURF
Craig.
CRAIG
What?
SMURF
Come here.
CRAIG
I'm busy.
SMURF
Doing what? Come here and give me a
kiss.
Craig steps back to his mum like a scolded kid. Smurf takes his
chin in her hand. He goes meek. She looks at him warmly, then
kisses him on the lips gentle and slow, his eyes closed. J
watches.

Inside Baz's new model Commodore as it drives a suburban street.
As he approaches his driveway, he spots a car parked down the
road. Two men sit behind the wheel.

out of the car, carrying a sports bag, and heads for the door,
glancing back across the street at the parked car.

He moves to the fence for a better look at the car. Standing by
a flower bush, he picks up garden shears and does a little
pruning, glancing up at the man behind the wheel.
Baz strides out across the street towards the car, clutching his
flowers. Two detectives sit inside the car, windows up. Baz taps
on the driver's window. The driver winds it down. Baz hands him
the flowers.
BAZ
These are for you.
AR DETECTIVE
Thanks, mate. You keep them. I don't
have a vase.
BAZ
What do you want?
AR DETECTIVE
We're just sitting here having a
think.
BAZ
You wanna go think somewhere else?
AR DETECTIVE
Yeah, maybe in a bit.
BAZ
He's not here, mate. You're wasting
your time.
AR DETECTIVE
Who's not here.
BAZ
You know who.
AR DETECTIVE
I don't know what you're talking
about.
They stare at each other a moment.
AR DETECTIVE
You better get those flowers in water,
mate. They won't last in this heat.
Beat, then Baz turns and heads back to the house.

Catherine meets Baz as he shuts the front door. She is holding
Evie.
CATHERINE
What are you doing to my roses?
Baz smiles. He hands Cath the flowers and kisses her warmly. He
takes Evie from her, bobbing her up and down on his hip.
CATHERINE
You’ve chopped my bush half to shit.
BAZ
It’s a plant, honey. They grow better
if you chop them half to shit. They
like it.
CATHERINE
How’d you go this morning?
Baz holds up nine fingers and shrugs his disappointment.
CATHERINE
Nine!?
Baz motions to Cath to keep quiet.
CATHERINE
What?
BAZ
Nothing. I want a drink.

You wanna fix daddy a drink?
Baz heads for the kitchen.

A CAR HORN. Craig glances in the rearview.
CRAIG
Yeah? What happened?
J
I squirmed out of it. No conviction.
Craig stares in the rearview.
A car pulls up beside Craig, two hoods inside. The hood closest
yells abuse. Craig just stares blankly at him.
HOOD
The light's green, idiot!
The hood car moves off. Craig moves with it, holding his stare.
They yell more abuse and up the speed. Craig stays with them,
side by side, his eyes dangerously off the road.
The hoods are enraged. They take off. Craig follows steadily.
He reaches under his seat and pulls out a gun. He puts it in
J's lap. J stares at it.
They wind down side streets. After two corners, the hood car
hits its brakes. They've had enough. Craig slows to a stop five
car lengths behind. He looks to J, who is staring at the gun in
his hands - he's never held one before in his life.
The men get out of the car. The driver hood approaches angry.
CRAIG
Go get him.
J
And do what?
CRAIG
Let him know who's king.

EXT. STREET - DAY

J climbs out of the car. One hood is almost on them. J raises
the gun tentatively, trying to maintain composure. The driver
immediately backs down, apologising, backing away. J says

How'd that feel? You get a stiffy?
J stares at the gun in his lap, then hands it back to Craig.
CRAIG
Butt first, mate.
Craig slides the gun under the seat. J is dazed. Craig laughs
into a coughing fit as he backs the car away.
Craig stops and realises he's gotten himself half lost in the
chase. He hits the brakes and finishes coughing.
CRAIG
Where are we?

INT. PET SHOP - DAY

J stands in front of fish tanks. Lots of PET NOISE.
Craig is a few metres away, before a wall of fish tanks, with
RANDALL ROACHE (40s) in a suit. Craig holds a brown paper bag.
Roache points to it.
ROACHE
That there's good. Tested at 85 per
cent. 400 grams. You can make that
stretch.
CRAIG
Is this the Anderis gear?
ROACHE
That's half. Other half's still in
lock up.

We'll talk about it later. My kid's in

He's fixed. Has your brother heard
these funny noises the Armed Robbery
Squad are making?
CRAIG
He's heard they're out to get him.
He's gone and fucked off somewhere.
Roache nods in J's direction, letting Craig know he hasn't heard
the click. J stares into the cage. Craig clicks again.
CRAIG
What’ve they got against him?
ROACHE
They want him off. They don't think
anything they've done is gonna stand
in court. So they wanna put him off
themselves.
J places the bag by the wall. He and Roache eye each other.
CRAIG
You know this for sure? What's he
supposed to do?
ROACHE
I'd just be telling him to pull his
head in. The whole thing's falling
apart over there, it's looking like
Armed Rob's about to be disbanded and
then I'd say this'll all go away. Just
tell him to pull his head in.
CRAIG
His head's in. Your head doesn't get
more in than Pope's head.
Roache reaches down for the bag J has left by his feet.
ROACHE
Mate, even if I gave a shit, you'd
still be telling the wrong guy.

the noise. Craig's crazy drunk, trying to convince Nicky to let
him throw a prawn into her mouth.
CRAIG
Come on. It's a test. Open wide.
Nicky shakes her head, nervous but enjoying the attention.

Parked round back. It's a white

Pope picks up a sports bag beside the couch. It's noticeably
heavy. Darren doesn’t move. He stares at the bong.
POPE
Why are you getting stoned now? What
makes you think that's a good idea?
Darren stands, puts keys in his pocket.
POPE

Anyone calls, tell them Darren’s in

LECKIE
G’day, Josh. I’m Detective Senior
Sergeant Leckie, this is Detective
Norris.
Leckie and Norris sit.
LECKIE
Mr. Harrop here is from the Department
of Human Services. It’s a requirement
under the law that in questioning
anyone under the age of 18, they must
be accompanied by a guardian or legal
representative. In the absence of such
a person, a department officer such as
John must be present. I must also
advise you that you are under no
obligation to say anything at this
point, but anything you do or say can
be used as evidence in any later court
appearances. Do you understand this,
Josh?
J nods. Leckie speaks casually, reassuring.
LECKIE
We won’t need to keep you too long.
J
I've already been here for hours.

J
I was at home.
LECKIE
What's the address there?
J
17 Harding Street, Ivanhoe.
LECKIE
And what were you doing at home last
night?
J looks around the room. The men watch him closely.
J
Watching TV.
LECKIE
Were your uncles at that same address
with you last night?
Seconds into the interview J finds himself having to fabricate
answers to simple questions. Norris takes notes.
J
They were home but I fell asleep
pretty early so I wouldn't have a clue
really what they were up to. I think
they might have just been watching TV

They came in at some point, but by

I wasn’t really paying attention about
what they were up to.
LECKIE
What were you watching?
J
I think it was probably like 'Funniest
Home Videos'. I was pretty much just
having a nap on the couch.
LECKIE
And at some point during the evening
all three of your uncles came into the
room, or only one, or two maybe? Can
you tell me exactly who was there?
J’s fact fabrication is only getting deeper. He wants out.
J
I can’t really tell you. I was that
sleepy I only remember that there were
people around, but I’m not sure who
exactly. I basically had my eyes shut
sort of thing.
LECKIE
You don’t remember who you heard?
J
(pauses)
The reason I was so sleepy and don’t
remember was because I smoked some
marijuana and I was knocked out sort
of thing. I didn’t want to tell you
that.
LECKIE
It's OK, Josh. We’re not concerned
with what you smoked.
Norris looks up from his note taking.

He was sad.

Sad in what way?
J
He was crying.
LECKIE
You physically saw him crying? What
did you see?
J
His face was all red and he had water
coming out of his eyes and he was
rubbing them.
LECKIE
How was he rubbing his eyes?
J
You know, like this.
J rubs his eyes like 'boo hoo'.
LECKIE
What's taken place then? Did he say
anything you can recall?

I’ve been smoking a fair bit lately
and my memory’s all fucked up, so I

CRAIG
You hear that?
RICHARD
Hear what?
CRAIG
I can hear your dogs.
Craig jumps up and heads outside. Through the windows, Richard
can see him walking close around the outside of the house,
examining the walls and windows.

I can't tell him anything.
Then, through the scanner, they hear Craig’s VOICE.
CRAIG (O.S.)
You cunt motherfuckers!
After a loud CRUNCH, the scanner returns to steady STATIC.
Craig bursts back in, near hysterical, dangling wires.
CRAIG
What the fuck is this, Rich?
RICHARD
What is it? I don't know!
CRAIG
It's a bug. There's a bug on your
fuckin house.
RICHARD
I don't know about it.
CRAIG
Bull-fuckin-shit, Rich! How could
there be a bug on your house within,

Maybe they were tapping your phone or
something. I don't know how it got

EXT. RURAL HOUSE - DAY

The screen door swings open, smacking against the front of the
house. Craig stumbles down off the porch and opens the back door
of his car, throwing his bag inside. He scrambles around in the
backseat for shotgun shells. He begins loading them into the
shotgun, fumbling, dropping them.
His ears prick. He sees a convoy of unmarked police cars
approaching fast down the long, dirt drive.
He crouches against the car and loads more shells. He looks to
the house in panic. Richard's at the window, looking back.
Craig stands and runs into the bush behind the house.
The cars come to a stop at the house. Detectives with shotguns
climb out and chase Craig into the bush.
Craig breathes heavy, sprinting through the undergrowth. He
trips, smashing his knees into a log. He squeals in pain and
gets to his feet. He tries to run but can't, hobbled.
He turns, raises his gun. Detectives are close behind. They stop
and fire. Craig is hammered by a blast and knocked down.
SILENCE but for SINGING BIRDS and the ECHO OF GUNSHOTS.
Detectives, guns by their sides, approach Craig’s bloody body
face down in the dirt.

Leckie stands and moves away from his family.
NORRIS (OVER)
He found the listening device in

Usually it's right there and I can

finding it now.
POPE
This is what I'm trying to say. I
don't know why people don't listen. If
you hadn't gotten in his ear about
handing himself over, there'd be none
of all this carrying on.
(to J)
And if you hadn't've gone to your
girlfriend's house instead of coming
home after. Did you think about that
when you were doing it? You've gone
and spooked him. Both of you. And now
look.
Smurf lifts herself up, walks to Pope and mechanically punches
him in the face. Pope flinches. He looks surprised.
She punches him again. He almost cowers like a kid.

Do you understand that?
J sits silent. Ezra looks up, distracted.
EZRA
He understands that.
LECKIE
Picking up where we left off, when we
last spoke, you were telling us how
upset your uncles were over the death
of Barry Brown. Can you recall exactly
what was said at that time?
J sits silent, but can already feel Leckie digging a hole for
him. Leckie waits for J to respond. He doesn't.
LECKIE
Josh, has Mr White provided you with
advice in respect to how should
conduct yourself in this interview
today?
EZRA
He'll be remaining mute.
LECKIE
I can appreciate you’ve been advised
not to say anything to me, but the
sooner you help us with our enquiries,
the sooner we can scratch you off the
list and move on to a different line.

sets about getting changed out of his suit and into tennis gear.
EZRA
I dunno. It doesn't have a good
feeling about it. Leckie ran the whole
‘yesterday you were very helpful’
routine. That was probably for my
benefit, but I dunno. He’s a kid. Kids
are stupid. They’re weak. He may think
he’s doing the right thing but really
his foot’s covered in dog shit and
he’s got it stuck right in his mouth.
I’m pretty surprised you’ve let him
get anywhere near you to be honest.
Pope is staring blankly at Darren.

Darren looks at Pope incredulous.

Don't be confused about it. I think

J looks through the window to the backyard. Daisy sniffs around

J steps slowly to a back door. He can see a bracelet sticking
out from under the iron.

caught on its edge. J's heart races.
J shifts the iron. It BANGS on the cement. Nothing underneath. J
pulls his phone from his pocket and dials a number. He waits.
And then Nicky's distinctive RINGTONE sounds from inside the
house.
The back door cracks open as Pope charges from the house and
across the back yard towards J.
J runs to the back fence, climbs it nimbly into the lane behind

Nick isn’t here. Is everything OK?
Gus steps out the way, letting J enter.

J looks down the street. It’s empty. Gus puts the car in Drive

the street. Then CRACK. The car is clipped hard from the front. It spins wildly,
then comes to a rest. Through the window, J can see Pope behind
the wheel of Darren's car, undoing his seat belt. Pope's car is
jammed between Gus's car and another parked in the street. Pope
can't open any doors - he's trapped inside.
J clambers into the backseat, past Gus who is dazed, blood
trickling down his forehead.
J stumbles out the backdoor into the street. He looks back. He
locks eyes with Gus, who looks back at him, vacant. And then
everything slows. J notices moments - a neighbour in a dressing
gown. J runs. MUSIC CUE...

J sits on a bench, mobile in hand. Leckie and two detectives

Ezra has the address. I don't think it

maybe a neighbour spotted a gun
somewhere. This is your field of

I think J's made his position clear.
Where that leaves us now is to decide
how best to proceed given the brave
offer of assistance he's made.
(beat)
This thing's going to trial, with or
without J. That's a given. What we
want is to win it. What I liked about
the committal hearing - despite the
fact that we've been ordered to stand
trial, of course - but what I liked
about the committal was that, for the
most part, their case looked pretty
flimsy to me, largely dependent on
testimony that shouldn't be too hard
to discredit I wouldn't have thought.
And if the committal was any
indicator, J here's their little star.
If he's not there, they'll need to
strengthen their brief with something
else, which they will do. And they'll
have the time to do it. And I'd
personally rather tackle the evidence
I saw at the committal than whatever
rejigged brief they come up with
should J suddenly decide to leave. You
know what I mean?
(to J)
So now we should just make proper use
of the time we have. We'll need to go
over a bunch of things here. Like, for
instance, this whole business of the
car you claim you stole and that you
claim you saw on the TV. It was just a
white car wasn't it? Millions of white
cars in the world. Why was that one so
familiar? Probably looked very similar

Leckie gently guides J from the window to the door, out into the
hall of the building towards the elevator.

164

INT. VAN - DAY

164

J in the back of a mini-van. Leckie is beside him. As the van
pulls out of an underground car park onto the street the SOG
officer in the front seat leans into his personal radio.
SOG
We’re on the move.
RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
Copy that.
Leckie watches J. J looks out the window. The radio crackles.

165

EXT. BACK OF SUPREME COURT - DAY

165

The vans are admitted through the back gates of the court
building. The gates are quickly closed by court officers.
The van stops at the back entrance. A SOG emerges first,
followed by J, then another two SOGs. J is hurried inside.

INT. SUPREME COURT / HOLDING AREA - DAY

106.

166

J sits in a holding area. There is quiet and tense anticipation.
He is clearly the centre of concern. He sits and waits. A court
warden approaches.
COURT WARDEN
OK. They're ready for you now.
J stands and is escorted down a hall. He and the warden wait
outside a door. The door opens. J enters.

169

INT. SUPREME COURT / HOLDING AREA - DAY

169

Inside the holding area, the air is muted and tense. Radios
crackle. Wardens and cops sit in silence, waiting.

INT. NATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA / CAFE - DAY

170

FLASHBACK: Hopper sits opposite J at a quiet table. Ezra and
Smurf sit at the next table. Ezra takes notes. Smurf watches.
HOPPER
Your girlfriend Nicole died from a
heroin overdose. Is this true?
J
Yes.
HOPPER
Is it true that you believe your
uncles were responsible for this?
J
Yes.
HOPPER
How?
J
They injected her.
HOPPER
Maybe don't rush your answers, mate.
The more you hesitate, the more
uncertain you'll appear.
SMURF
How's he gonna remember all this?
HOPPER
He doesn't have to remember it. It's
better if he doesn't.

CONTINUED:

107.

We don't want him reciting lines. All
he needs to do here is get into the
swing of the thing. He just needs to
wrap his head around the flavour of
it.
(beat, to J)
You understand that, mate?
J nods.
HOPPER (CONT'D)
So, you're saying they forcibly
injected her with what's known as a
hot shot?
J
Yes.
HOPPER
Did you see them do this?
J
No.
HOPPER
What did you see?
J
I came home and found her bracelet
thing in the backyard.
HOPPER
But you didn’t actually see her there,
nor did you see anyone inject her. Was
she known to you to be a user of
heroin?
J
Sometimes, yeah.
HOPPER
Was she? This is me talking now.
J
No.
HOPPER
Then say no. You don't need to lie...
Was there any reason why she might
have wanted to use heroin on this
particular night?
J
Maybe.

CONTINUED: (2)
HOPPER
Why maybe?
J
I broke up with her.
HOPPER
That night?
J
Yes.
HOPPER
So to an extent you feel responsible
for Nicole’s death.
J
I dunno. Maybe to an extent.
HOPPER
But you want your uncles put away for
it. Even though you didn’t see them do
it and she was justifiably upset on
this particular night because you
ended the relationship.
J looks coolly to Ezra taking notes and Smurf watching.
HOPPER (CONT'D)
You’re looking for someone to blame
for something you feel responsible
for. Would you agree with that? Blah
blah blah.
J looks to Hopper, defiant. He holds it.
HOPPER (CONT'D)
That's good, mate. You feel OK?
SMURF
Are you OK, sweetheart?
J
I'm fine. Can you find us a drink,
Smurf?
SMURF
Of course. I'm sure I saw a drink
machine somewhere.

171

INT. SUPREME COURT / HOLDING AREA - DAY

171

Commotion. J is led from the court, through back corridors.

172

INT. SOG VAN - DAY

109.

172

The van drives through the back gate of the court, J surrounded
by SOGs with shotguns. J is pensive. Heavily armed SOG presence
is oppressive - gum chewing, guns on laps.

173

INT. CAR - DAY

173

BROADCAST VIDEO FOOTAGE: A REPORTER sits at the wheel of a car,
the video shot from the passenger seat. The reporter checks his
hair in the rearview and scours the street over the cameraman‘s
shoulder.
REPORTER
(nervous energy)
Here they come.
He starts the car. The video camera POV shifts to the empty
backseat. Moments later, the back door opens. Darren, Smurf and
Pope pile in and the car pulls away. The boys wear suits. Darren
cries. Smurf hugs him. Pope smiles. It's all chaotic.
REPORTER (O.C.)
Let's get away from here a bit.
(then, to backseat)
How do you feel?
DARREN
We’re over the moon! We’re very over
the moon! Fantastic!
Smurf kisses Darren's head. Darren is crying tears of joy.
REPORTER (O.C.)
What about you, Andrew? Has justice
been done today?
Pope stares out the window.
DARREN
We were innocent. We said that all
along. That’s what the jury's said.
REPORTER (O.C.)
Janine. You must be delighted. What do
you have to say?
SMURF
I want to say three cheers for the
boys! Hip-hip.
DARREN
Hooray!

CONTINUED:
Smurf and Darren do three cheers. Pope looks out the window.
REPORTER (O.C.)
OK, let's get some nods before we
forget.
The CAMERA swings round to be on the reporter.
REPORTER
Tell me when you're set.
CAMERMAN (O.C.)
Set.
REPORTER
(to rearview)
OK, guys, I just have to do what we
call nods. You don't have to say
anything. You'll see what it's about
when it's all cut together.
The reporter does some 'nods'. Then REPORTER
So how do you feel?
DARREN (O.C.)
Fantastic!
REPORTER
No. You don't say anything.

174

INT. SOG VAN - DAY

174

On the move, a SOG opposite J pulls his pistol and points it at
J's face, the SOG’s eyes hidden behind sunglasses. Other SOGs
sit quiet. The SOG holds the gun for a long while, then pulls
the trigger. It clicks on an empty breach. J sits numb.

175

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

175

Smurf in TV interview on the couch in a four-star hotel room.
SMURF
I feel for the families of those two
young police, my heart goes out, but
two good young boys got killed too,
Barry Brown and my son Craig.
The shot is now wide to reveal Smurf sitting between Pope and
Darren on the couch. The boys hold glasses of white wine and are
visibly drunk and fidgeting.

(CONTINUED)

Animal Kingdom - GREEN REVISIONS

111.

CONTINUED:
SMURF
They were innocent young boys. My
family's been dragged through the mud
over this. And that kind of action
plays heavy our on minds. Police start
throwing their weight around, and they
fly off the handle and a kid like J
gets the idea he can’t even trust the
law to work properly. The justice
system.
Pope lifts himself up drunkenly and leaves shot. Darren gets up
and dials a phone on a side table behind the couch.
REPORTER (O.C.)
OK, maybe that's enough of that.
(to Pope)
Andrew, I was hoping to get some shots
of you and Darren reacting to the news
of your acquittal on TV.
POPE (O.C.)
Get us doing what?
REPORTER (O.C.)
As if you were watching a news report
on the TV, celebrating. Like you're
going 'yay!'
Darren drops the phone. It crashes down behind the side table.
He's very drunk.
POPE (O.C.)
I’m not a fuckin monkey, mate. I’m not
doing that.
As this all takes place, Smurf remains in the middle of the
couch, watching her boys. Then she turns to camera, smiling.

176

INT. BEDROOM / SERVICED APARTMENT - NIGHT

176

J hurriedly packs his clothes into a bag. He zips it shut and
turns to leave. SOGs mill in the hall ominously. J steps back
into the room.
Leckie enters and shuts the door. He sits on the bed, silent and
staring at J. The moment is long and awkward.
LECKIE
Have you worked out where you fit?
J grabs his bag. He opens the door and closes it behind him.

SOG talk halts, all eyes on J. He winds his way to the door.

INT. BEDROOM / SERVICED APARTMENT - NIGHT

178

Back in the bedroom, Leckie sits like a lonely kid.

179

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

179

Leckie with his wife, son and trolley. They round an aisle. And
then Leckie sees Smurf. He ignores her. They head towards each
other. Leckie pushes his trolley straight past her. He thinks
she hasn't seen him.
Then Smurf appears beside him.
SMURF
I don't wish you any ill will, Mr
Leckie. I honestly don't.
Leckie ignores her. His wife watches her, seriously unnerved.
SMURF
I want you to know that. You were only
doing your job. I hope you catch the
people who did that terrible thing.
LECKIE
If you're as smart as I think you are,
you'd know to walk right on by me like
we'd never seen each other before in
our lives. And you'd know to feel
lucky. But you're gonna come unstuck.
I've got a feeling about it. I think
you do too. I think you carry that
feeling around with you every second
of the day.
Smurf looks at him, almost tenderly.
SMURF
But I don't, Nathan.
Leckie leads his family away. Smurf is left in the aisle.

180

EXT. STREET - DAY

180

J steps out of a city cafe with a take-away coffee. He sits it
on a ledge and stirs in sugar, lights himself a cigarette.

EXT. BACK YARD / CODY HOUSE - DAY

113.

181

J walks the side of the house, bag on his shoulder,
apprehensive. He hears MUSIC and LAUGHTER. He rounds the corner
to see Darren on a banana lounge drinking, another man also
drinking, and Pope at the BBQ flipping sausages.
Darren stops mid-laugh, his unwitting friend carries on a little
longer. Pope casually continues to flip sausages.
POPE
(warmly)
G’day, mate.
J
Hey. Hi, Daz.
The dog rushes to J. He pats it.
POPE
You hungry?
J
Yeah, maybe.
POPE
Smurf’s in the kitchen. Go and say hi.
Grab yourself a beer.

182

INT. KITCHEN / CODY HOUSE - DAY

182

J enters. Smurf is at the bench, making salad. She turns and
sees J. She rushes to him. She hugs and kisses him.
SMURF
I was wondering when I’d see you
again. I've been missing you. You want
food? You look Biafran.
J
I’m gonna go lie down a bit.
SMURF
You don’t wanna eat? Pope’s cooking.
J
I wanna lie down, I think.
SMURF
OK, love. Your room’s still there.
Smurf takes J's head in her hands and kisses his lips.

I missed you.

183

INT. J’S BEDROOM / CODY HOUSE - DAY

183

The room is tidy. J is on the bed, lying on his side. He hears
the bedroom door open, but doesn’t turn to look.
Pope takes a seat at the end of the bed, holding a beer. He
looks around the room, taking it all in before speaking.
POPE
It's a crazy fuckin world.
A GUN BLAST strikes Pope in the head and his body slumps like a
sack of meat, instantly lifeless, to the floor.
J climbs off the bed, holding a gun. He stands back and surveys
the scene, standing over Pope's body.
He exits to the hall still with the gun. As he heads for the
lounge, Smurf walks toward him, panicked, hands to her mouth. J
stops her. He holds her. She is strangely calm, catatonic.

184

INT. LOUNGE / CODY HOUSE - DAY

184

J leads Smurf across the room to the window, his arm around her.
Darren is outside, looking back at him, disoriented.
J seems relaxed, composed. Darren is barefoot, holding a ketchup
bottle and a long sausage in a slice of bread.
J tosses the gun on the couch and kisses Smurf's head.
