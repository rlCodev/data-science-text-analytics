COLD OPENING / A
FADE IN:
INT. FERTILITY CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY (DAY 1)
(Leonard, Sheldon, Althea, Extras)
WE OPEN ON LEONARD, A POST-DOCTORAL THEORETICAL PHYSICIST, AN
ACTUAL GENIUS -- HIS IQ IS OFF THE CHARTS. HE SITS
IMPATIENTLY FOR A BEAT, SEES A RUBIK'S CUBE ON THE TABLE,
PICKS IT UP AND SOLVES IT IN A FEW DEFT MOVES. HIS FRIEND
AND ROOMMATE, SHELDON, ALSO A VERIFIABLE GENIUS WITH SIMILAR
CREDENTIALS, EMERGES THROUGH A DOOR.
LEONARD
Took you long enough.
SHELDON
If you had any inkling of what I've
just been through I think you'd be a
little more sympathetic.
LEONARD
What could you have been through?

You

went in there to make a sperm deposit.
SHELDON
Leonard, think about it.

We’re

selling our sperm to a high IQ sperm
bank, but we can’t guarantee high IQ
offspring.

Extreme intelligence is as

much of a mutation as the migrating
eye of the flounder.

LEONARD
And this came to you while you were...
pleasuring yourself?
SHELDON
Yes.
LEONARD
Did you see they had movies in there?
SHELDON
I couldn't stop thinking we were
committing fraud.

Some poor woman is

going to pin her hopes on my sperm.
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use an
integral or a differential to solve
for the area under a curve.
LEONARD
I'm sure she'll still love him.
SHELDON
I wouldn't.
LEONARD
Sheldon, did you fill the cup or not?
SHELDON
Oh, I don’t think the cups are
designed to be filled.

The size is

meant to facilitate aim, like the
spittoons of the Old West.

Eventually.

Oh, yes.

For the record,

I have tennis elbow and I'm chafed.
LEONARD
Come on.
THEY CROSS TO THE COUNTER WHERE A RATHER BORED WOMAN, ALTHEA,
SITS BEHIND THE COUNTER WORKING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE. SHE
DOESN'T LOOK UP.
LEONARD (CONT'D)
Excuse me.
ALTHEA
(INTENT ON THE PUZZLE)

Hang on.

LEONARD
One across is "Aegean."

Eight down is

"Nabokov," twenty-six across is "MCM,"
thirteen down is - move your finger "phylum," which makes thirteen
across... Port-au-Prince.
UNHAPPY LOOK)

(OFF HER

Ta-da!

ALTHEA
Can I help you?
LEONARD
Yes, we’ve made two deposits.

That’s

about eighty million egg-seeking
geniuses.

It's not right.

LEONARD
Can you give us a minute?

He's having a crisis of conscience.
I'm sure you get this all the time.

Not really.

ALTHEA
Most of the fellas pretty

much come and go.

(TO SHELDON)

LEONARD
This was your idea.

A

little extra spending money and we
pick up the eight-inch Celestron
telescope with the digital star finder
and the altazimuth mount.
SHELDON
I know, and I'm sorry.

(TO ALTHEA)

We'd like our... contribution back.

You want me to go back there and bring
you your sperm?

Yes.

Should I leave it in the cups or do
you want me to see if I have a vase or
maybe a gravy boat?
SHELDON
The cups are fine.
LEONARD USHERS SHELDON OUT THE DOOR.
LEONARD
How is it you can recite pi to eighty
decimal places but you can't recognize
sarcasm?

COLD OPENING / B
INT. STAIRWELL - LATER THAT DAY (DAY 1)
(Leonard, Sheldon, Penny)
LEONARD AND SHELDON, HOLDING BAGS OF TAKE-OUT INDIAN FOOD,
CLIMB THE FIVE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS THAT LEAD TO THEIR
APARTMENT.
SHELDON
How long are you going to be mad at
me?
LEONARD
I don't know.
SHELDON
Do you see your anger fading gradually
like a radioactive half-life, or
suddenly like a quantum shift:

angry,

not angry.
LEONARD
I. Don't. Know.
SHELDON
Well, for the moment it appears to be
holding steady.
THEY CLIMB IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT.
SHELDON (CONT'D)
Do you want to hear an interesting
thing about stairs?

LEONARD
Not really.
SHELDON
If the height of a single step is off
by as little as two millimeters, most
people will trip.
LEONARD
Two millimeters? That doesn't seem
right.

It's true.

SHELDON
I did a series of

experiments when I was twelve.

My

father broke his clavicle.
RESET TO:
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
THEY HEAD FROM THE STAIRS TO THEIR APARTMENT.
LEONARD
Is that why they sent you to boarding
school?
SHELDON
No, that was a result of my work with
lasers.
SHELDON PUTS THE KEY IN THEIR LOCK, WHEN THEY HEAR...
MUSIC CUE:

FUNKY UP TEMPO MUSIC

...FROM A BOOMBOX. THEY TURN AND SEE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,
PENNY, DANCING WITH RECKLESS ABANDON THROUGH THE OPEN DOORWAY
OF THE APARTMENT ACROSS THE HALL. THEY WATCH FOR A FEW
BEATS, MESMERIZED BY HER RAW SEXUALITY.

SHELDON

A significant improvement over the old
neighbor.
SHELDON
Assuming one prefers incandescently
attractive women to Harold the old fat
nudist.
LEONARD
May he rest in peace.
THE BOYS WATCH AS PENNY PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH OF A HANDSOME
MAN AND SETS IT ON FIRE WITH A LIGHTER. SHE DOESN'T NOTICE
THEM AS SHE CONTINUES TO DANCE.
SHELDON
This might be cause for concern.
LEONARD
Could be a red flag.
PENNY REALIZES THAT SHE'S BEING WATCHED.

EACH OTHER AS THEY TRY TO EXIT GRACEFULLY.
RESET TO:
INT. LEONARD AND SHELDON'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
THE APARTMENT IS A LIVING ROOM, DINING AREA AND A SMALL
KITCHEN. DOORS LEAD OFF TO BEDROOMS AND A BATHROOM.
EVERYWHERE WE LOOK WE SEE BOOKS, SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS,
COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, GREASE BOARDS AND OTHER FLAT SURFACES
PRESSED INTO USE AS GREASE BOARDS, ALL COVERED WITH
EQUATIONS. AS THEY ENTER...
LEONARD
Should we have invited her for lunch?
SHELDON
Why would we do that?
LEONARD
She's obviously going through some
emotional upheaval.

We should help.

SHELDON
I'm not aware of anything in the
social code that suggests we should
intervene.

Not

Also, you'd have to

have been knighted for that to apply.
LEONARD
We're going to be good neighbors.
We're going to invite her over, make
her feel comfortable and engage her in
conversation.
SHELDON
That doesn't sound like us.
LEONARD
It's not difficult. You listen to
what she says and you say something
appropriate in response.
LEONARD CROSSES OUT, SHELDON FOLLOWS.
No.

SHELDON
Definitely not us.
RESET TO:

THEY CROSS TO PENNY'S DOOR AND KNOCK.

Hi.

PENNY OPENS HER DOOR.

SHELDON
Hi.
PENNY
Hi.
LEONARD
So anyway, I don't know if you
noticed, but we were carrying bags.
Of food.

Indian food.

And I find

when I'm going through emotional
difficulties, which is what appears to
be going on with you, good food and
company can have a comforting effect.
Also, curry is a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that a clean
colon is... one less thing to worry
about.
SHELDON
Leonard, I'm no expert here, but I
believe in the context of a luncheon
invitation, you might want to skip the
discussion of bowel movements.
PENNY
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
LEONARD
Uh, yeah.

That's so sweet. Hang on.

You're most welcome.

Hey, this looks like some serious
stuff.

Leonard, did you do this?

SHELDON
(MOCK HUMILITY) Yeah, well, it's just
some quantum mechanics with a little
string theory doodling around the
edges.

That part there’s just a joke.

It’s a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.
PENNY
So you're like one of those "Beautiful
Mind" genius guys?

(SHEEPISHLY)

SHELDON
Yeah.

(RE: BOARD)

PENNY
This is really

impressive.
LEONARD
I have a board. If you like boards,
this is my board.
LEONARD INDICATES ANOTHER GREASE BOARD FILLED WITH EQUATIONS.
PENNY
Holy smokes.
SHELDON
If by "holy smokes" you mean a
derivative restatement of the kind of
stuff you can find scribbled on the
wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure.

INDIAN FOOD.
LEONARD
Hey, at least I don’t have to invent
twenty-six dimensions just to make the
math come out.
SHELDON
I didn’t invent them, they’re there!
LEONARD
In what universe?
SHELDON
In all of them. That's the point!

SHELDON SEES PENNY ON ONE END OF THE COUCH.
Um, Penny?

SHELDON
No, I sit there.
PENNY
What's the difference?
SHELDON
What's the difference?
LEONARD
Here we go.
SHELDON
In the winter, that spot is close
enough to the radiator to be warm, yet
not so close as to be uncomfortable.
In the summer, it is directly in the
path of a cross breeze created by
opening windows there and there.

It

faces the television at an angle that
is neither direct, thus discouraging
conversation, nor so far wide as to
create parallax distortion.

I could

go on, but I think I've made my point.
PENNY
Would you like to switch?
SHELDON
No, I'm fine.
SHELDON UNHAPPILY SITS NEXT TO HER.

Well, that's probably

enough about us.

Me?

Okay...

(CHANGING

Tell us about you.

PENNY
I'm a Sagittarius which

probably tells you more than you need
to know.
SHELDON
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion that the
sun's apparent position relative to
arbitrarily defined constellations at
the time of your birth somehow affects
your personality.
PENNY
I'm sorry?
LEONARD
I think what Sheldon's trying to say
is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.
PENNY
I get that a lot because I have a
really strong moon in Virgo.

That's interesting. Leonard can't
process corn.
LEONARD GIVE SHELDON ANOTHER LOOK.

SHELDON SHRUGS, "WHAT?"

PENNY
And I'm a José Cuervo shot girl but
I'm also writing a screenplay about a
girl who came to L.A. to be an actress
and failed and wound up as a José

There,

there.
PENNY
It's just this breakup.

I'm sorry.

It wouldn't be a big deal except I
still love him.
LEONARD
Sure.
PENNY
But at the same time I hate his
freakin' guts.
LEONARD IS AT A LOSS.
EQUALLY CLUELESS.

Pretty crazy, huh?
HE LOOKS AT SHELDON.

LEONARD
No, it's not crazy, it's just... a
paradox.

And paradoxes are a part of

nature.

Think about light.

If you

look at Huygens, light is a wave, as
confirmed by the double-slit
experiments.

But along comes Albert

Einstein and he discovers that light
behaves like particles, too.

different category.

Frankly she's not even my type, but as

LEONARD CONSIDERS THIS FOR A BEAT.

Okay, I think we can go.
LEONARD WRITES A PHONE NUMBER ON A SCRAP OF PAPER AND HANDS
IT TO KOOTHRAPPALI.

This is my cell phone number.

Give it

Let me propose another approach which
might have a better chance of
achieving your goal.
LEONARD
Okay.
SHELDON
Lure Penny to a lead-lined shelter
you've built far beneath the surface
of the earth and keep her there until
the rest of humanity is consumed by a

I'm sorry, do you speak English?
WOLOWITZ CROSSES OVER WITH A TRAY OF FOOD.
WOLOWITZ
Oh, he speaks English.

He just can't

speak when there's a woman in the

Really?

PENNY
Why?

WOLOWITZ
Well, basically he's nuttier than rat

he's also the best particle physicist
