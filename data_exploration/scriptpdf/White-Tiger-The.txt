I wondered if any wilderness would be more desolate than this! And
then I remembered another of the kind – the home I’d left behind.

dialogues in English.
SUPER TITLE: NEW DELHI - 2007
Music, “Beware of the Boys,” featuring Jay-Z blasts as we
see:
INSERTS - feet, hands, faces of the Dandi March statue in
Delhi... leading us to Gandhi, leading the procession.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI STREETS - NIGHT
The car’s headlights glow in a fog of pollution. It speeds
past a large statue of Gandhi - the Dandi March.
CLOSE ON THE EYES OF BALRAM (early 20s, clean-shaven, thin)
looking out the back seat window as the Dandi March flies by.
For some reason, Balram is dressed as a MAHARAJA.
Balram’s POV: ASHOK laughing in the passenger seat with his
wife PINKY MADAM who is driving fast (both early 30s). They
are drunk.
PINKY MADAM
Should I switch to tequila now?
Why not?

ASHOK

They look at Balram in the back.
PINKY MADAM
Maharaja, sing for me!
ASHOK
Sing, sing, sing.
She swerves around an oncoming rickshaw.
PINKY MADAM
Why’s he on this side of the road?
BALRAM
(nervous)
Madam, should I drive now.
PINKY MADAM
Are you worried, Maharaja?
BALRAM
No, no, I’m not worried.

2.
Balram’s POV: her eyes flirt with him in the rear-view
mirror.
PINKY MADAM
You’re worried, haha.
BALRAM
Madam, a cow!
Ashok grabs the wheel to help her swerve around a cow in the
road.
Holy cow!

ASHOK

They laugh.
BALRAM’S POV: HOMELESS on the roadside watch the car fly by.
Ashok sings to Pinky and they drunkenly laugh.
ASHOK
Happy birthday to you, happy
birthday to you!
Then, A SMALL FIGURE darts in front of the car.
BALRAM
Look out, look out!
It’s too late. Before they crash, we FREEZE FRAME ON BALRAM.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Pardon me, your Excellency, this is
no way to start a story. I am
Indian after all, and it is an
ancient and venerated custom of my
people to start a story by praying
to a Higher Power.
EXT. RELIGIOUS TEMPLES - VARIOUS
Various Hindu temples, Christian churches, Muslim mosques;
iconography from each; BELIEVERS praying.
BALRAM (V.O.)
So I too should start off by
kissing some god’s foot. But which
god? The Muslims have one. The
Christians have three. And we
Hindus have 36,000,000. Making a
grand total of 36,000,004 divine
feet for me to choose from.

3.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
BALRAM (late 20s, moustachioed, pot-bellied) sits under a
chandelier in the lotus position, eyes closed.
BALRAM (V.O.)
There are some, not just Communists
like you, who think that none of
these gods exist. But in my country
it pays to play it both ways. The
Indian entrepreneur has to be
straight and crooked, mocking and
believing, sly and sincere, all at
the same time.
Travel to Balram; he opens his eyes, stares into the camera.
LATER - Balram watches TV news about CHINESE PREMIER WEN
JIABAO’s upcoming trip to India. Under maps of BANGALORE,
Balram types an email to Wen Jiabao at his laptop:
BALRAM (V.O.)
Mr. Jiabao, your Excellency, when I
heard you were coming to meet some
Indian entrepreneurs, I just knew I
had to email you. Our nation,
though it has no drinking water,
electricity, sewage system, public
transportation, sense of hygiene,
discipline, courtesy, or
punctuality, does have
entrepreneurs.
News SPEAKS of the two rising economic super powers: CHINA &
INDIA [stock footage]. Our hero, Balram, intently listens.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I’ve been following the rise of
your country for some time, sir. I
know you Chinese are great lovers
of freedom and individual liberty.
The British tried to make you their
servants but you never let them. I
admire that, Mr. Premier. You see,
I was a servant once.
We move off his face and discover the SMALL STATUE OF BUDDHA.
EXT./INT. WHITE TIGER DRIVERS / FIRST FLOOR OFFICES - NIGHT
Balram comes downstairs. Drivers loiter, OPERATORS man
phones. Balram sees a YOUNG BOY, DHARAM (11) doing homework.
He glances up at Balram, who nods.

4.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Today, I’m a celebrated
entrepreneur in Bangalore - the
Silicon Valley of India. They say
it’s named after a Silicon Valley
in “America,” but I find that hard
to believe. I think we can agree
that America is so “yesterday.”
India and China are so “tomorrow.”
He steps outside and surveys a bustling taxi service. A
servant brings him coffee, “Sir.” Balram is master here.
BALRAM (V.O.)
In the belief that the future of
the world lies with the yellow man
and the brown man now that our
erstwhile master, the white-skinned
man, has wasted himself through
buggery, cell phone usage, and drug
abuse, I offer to tell you, free of
charge, the truth about India, by
telling you the story of my life.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE / GANGA RIVER - DAY [PAST]
Water buffaloes, plenty of them.
BALRAM (V.O.)
These are the best fed and most
important members of my family.
After them...
EXT. BALRAM'S FAMILY HOME; LAXMANGARH - DAY
GRANNY surveys the village like a queen.
BALRAM (V.O.)
My sly old granny Kusum.
EXT. TEA SHOP / LAXMANGARH - DAY
YOUNG KISHAN (14) smashes coal at the tea shop.
BALRAM (V.O.)
She had forced my brother, Kishan,
to work in the tea shop.

5.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - DAY
BALRAM’S FATHER strains to pull the heavy rickshaw.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And she took every rupee from my
father, a rickshaw puller.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - DAY
Various images of kids, men bathing near buffaloes, hard poor
living.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I come from the village of
Laxmangarh, which is in the
Darkness. India is two countries in
one...
EXT. GHATS AT A RIVER - DAY
BALRAM (V.O.)
...an India of Light.
Young Balram walks along the ghats and gawks at WHITE WOMAN &
MAN (with dreads) doing yoga poses.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And an India of Darkness.
Balram sees: Sadhus bath, women wash clothes, men brush
teeth, in the filthy river.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I think a rich man like you knows
which one I come from.
Young Balram sits and stares at the river.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
A scanned poster with a smudged and barely recognizable photo
of his face is on the laptop. Balram prints it.
BALRAM (V.O.)
To give you the basic facts about
me, there’s no beating that poster,
the one the police made of me, some
years ago, due to an act of
entrepreneurship.

6.
As the poster he sees: “ASSISTANCE SOUGHT IN SEARCH FOR
MISSING MAN.”
BALRAM (V.O.)
Yes, the police are looking for me.
Why? I’ll get to that in time, but
only if you promise not to judge me
until I’ve told you my glorious
tale.
INT. SCHOOL IN LAXMANGARH - MORNING
A SCHOOL INSPECTOR in a blue suit point his cane to three
sentences in English on the chalkboard. Young Balram watches
him point to a boy SCHOOL INSPECTOR
Read. Yes, you.
Balram watches the Boy stand... and remain silent.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
Can’t you read it?
BOY #1
A, B, G, Z...
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
Stop! Have you taught them nothing,
you useless fuck?
TEACHER
Sorry, sir Balram stands and gets the Inspector’s attention.
YOUNG BALRAM
(reads the English)
We live in a glorious land. The
Lord Buddha received enlightenment
in this land. We are grateful to
God that we are born in this land.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
(impressed)
Come here, boy.
Balram steps forward. The Inspector pulls out a photo.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
Who is this woman?

7.
YOUNG BALRAM
The Great Socialist, sir.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
And what is the Great Socialist’s
message for little children?
YOUNG BALRAM
Any poor boy in any forgotten
village can grow up to become prime
minister of India.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
In the jungle, what is the rarest
of animals that comes along only
once in a generation?
YOUNG BALRAM
... The white tiger.
The Inspector points his cane right at Balram’s face.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
That’s what you are: a white tiger.
I will ensure you get a scholarship
to a school far away from here, in
our glorious capital - Delhi.
Balram beams with pride.
EXT. LAXMANGARH POND - SUNSET
Balram climbs over his Father’s knotted back, passing his
palm over his forehead, eyes, nose, neck. They laugh.
YOUNG BALRAM
Papa, know what this is called?
What?

BALRAM’S FATHER

YOUNG BALRAM
It’s called “Clavicle”.
Clavicle?

BALRAM’S FATHER

YOUNG BALRAM
And these are called “shoulders”.
And this is called “backbone”.
The Father grabs Balram and tickles him as he rattles off
body parts in English and they laugh together.

8.
EXT. BALRAM'S FAMILY HOME; LAXMANGARH - NIGHT
WOMEN sleep in one pile. MEN in another. Only Balram is
awake, reading a book - in ENGLISH.
BALRAM (V.O.)
In the darkness, we all slept
together, with legs falling one
over the other, like one creature:
a millipede.
He turns when he hears someone FART.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE / MAIN JUNCTION / TEA SHOP - DAY
Balram and KIDS chase a white Ambassador car that enters the
village. Kishan watches from the tea shop he works in.
RAM PERSAD (the driver) opens the door for THE STORK (late
40s, tall) and his son MUKESH (20s, dark, short, broad).
BALRAM (V.O.)
The Stork. He was the landlord who
ruled our village and collected a
third of everything we earned.
A sycophant FISHMONGER brings a basket of fish to the Stork,
who smacks him in the head.
BALRAM (V.O.)
He fed so much on the village that
there was nothing left to feed on.
Balram’s POV: Mukesh (Mongoose) collects money from RICKSHAW
PULLERS - Balram’s dad is at the end of the shake-down line.
BALRAM (V.O.)
We feared his elder son, “the
Mongoose,” even more.... And my
father was always in debt to them.
Balram’s POV: his father won’t pay, so Mukesh SLAPS him and
SHOUTS at him. This rattles Balram.
INT. SCHOOL IN LAXMANGARH - MORNING
Teacher sleeps. Kids fight & play. Only Balram reads a book.
Psst.

YOUNG KISHAN

Balram sees his brother at the door.

9.
YOUNG KISHAN
Get your book, chalk and let’s go.
Confused, Balram gathers his stuff and EXT. TEA SHOP; LAXMANGARH - DAY
They near the tea shop, where the Owner sees them. Balram
realizes what’s happening.
YOUNG BALRAM
The tea shop? I’m supposed to go to
Delhi.
YOUNG KISHAN
Father didn’t pay the master.
Granny said you have to work now.
TEA SHOP OWNER
Kishan, what’re you doing? Get to
work!
Kishan pushes Balram forward.
INT. TEA SHOP; LAXMANGARH - LATER
Kishan drops a gunnysack filled with coals in front of
Balram. He smashes one and pours the remains into the oven.
YOUNG KISHAN
Now break every last one.
Balram hesitates.
YOUNG KISHAN
You don’t like it? Imagine it’s my
skull you’re breaking.
He leaves. A beat. Balram breaks coal into many pieces.
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME; LAXMANGARH - SUNSET
The family eats. Balram, covered in coal grime, sees his
father who keeps his head down in shame.
GRANNY
Eat your dinner, sweetie.
He glares at his Granny.

10.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I never saw the inside of a school
again.
GRANNY
(grinning)
Eat it.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE / MAIN JUNCTION - DAY
Balram watches his father strain to pull the heavy rickshaw.
BALRAM (V.O.)
By the end of the year my father
was sick with tuberculosis.
Balram’s POV: His father COUGHS - blood splatters on road.
BALRAM (V.O.)
No politician had built a hospital
in Laxmangarh, so we had to travel
two days to another village.
EXT./INT. FREE HOSPITAL - DAY
They help their Father past goats into the rundown hospital.
Balram sits with his Father on the floor next to SICK PEOPLE.
YOUNG KISHAN
I’ll try and find a doctor.
Balram watches Kishan run to two WARD BOYS. He bribes them.
BALRAM (V.O.)
No doctor ever came. Election
promises, sir, had taught me how
important it is not to be a poor
man in a free democracy.
His Father coughs up blood. Balram holds his father in his
arms and wipes a damp towel over his forehead.
He is holding his dying father...
EXT. GHATS AT GANGA RIVER - AFTERNOON
Balram walks with the family carrying his father’s corpse on
their shoulders. A PRIEST CHANTS.
At the ghats - a funeral pyre. Balram watches the priest SET
HIS FATHER’S CORPSE ON FIRE.

11.
Balram is transfixed -- He sees his father’s foot jerk out,
curl up and resist the fire.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Even in death, he was resisting his
fate, resisting to die, be reborn
and die again, all for nothing.
Balram stops breathing. His eyes flutter. HE FAINTS... He
lies on the ghat - his face, serene in the sunlight.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I understood in this moment how
hard it is for a man to win his
freedom in India.
EXT. MARKET - DAY
CU on a rooster, clucking. Pull back to reveal chickens
stuffed into wire cages.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Later, I came to realize “why.” The
greatest thing to come out of this
country in its ten thousand year
history: The Rooster Coop.
A BUTCHER de-feathers and cuts the throat of a rooster blood - while the others indifferently watch.
BALRAM (V.O.)
They can see and smell the blood.
They know they’re next. Yet they
don’t rebel, they don’t try and get
out of the coop.
EXT. DELHI - MORNING
Crowds of working class Indians in the streets, servants busy
carrying loads, running about.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Servants here have been raised to
behave the same way.
A RICKSHAW DRIVER pedals a heavy load of furniture.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The furniture on his back is worth
at least two years his salary.

12.
EXT. POSH HOME; DELHI - DAY
The Rickshaw Driver drops off his load at A RICH WOMAN’s
home. She puts a wad of CASH in his hand.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And yet he will faithfully pedal it
all the way back to his boss,
without ever touching a single
rupee.
EXT. MARKET - DAY
Driver hands the cash to the STORE OWNER and bows - namaste.
BALRAM (V.O.)
No servant does. Why? Because
Indians are the world’s most honest
and spiritual people?
EXT. DELHI - DAY
WIDE: Masses of PEOPLE, poor, homeless, servants, traffic...
BALRAM (V.O.)
No. It’s because 99.9 percent of us
are caught in the Rooster Coop. The
trustworthiness of servants is so
strong that you can put the key of
emancipation in a man’s hand and he
will throw it back at you with a
curse.
EXT./INT. TEA SHOP / LAXMANGARH - DAY
CU - a coal breaks into pieces. BALRAM IS NOW AN ADULT (early
20s) still breaking coal in the tea shop.
LATER - He wipes the floor, tables, and listens to CUSTOMERS.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I had learned to use my time to
eavesdrop on customers waiting for
an opportunity, something my
brother had given up on long ago.
He sees a lethargic ADULT KISHAN (late 20s) serve tea.
LATER

13.
Balram sees: a shiny MITSUBISHI PAJERO SUV enters the
village, chased by KIDS. The driver, older Ram Persad (50s),
opens the door for older Stork (60) and ADULT MUKESH (40).
BALRAM (V.O.)
I know communists like you don’t
believe in god, sir, but do you
believe in fate?
BALRAM SEES ADULT ASHOK (early 30s) get out of the car
listening to an ipod with earbuds - he looks like a god.
BALRAM (V.O.)
That was when I first saw him, the
Stork’s youngest son, Mr. Ashok. He
had just moved from America back to
India, to Dhanbad, where his family
had made a fortune in coal. I knew
then: this was the master for me.
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME - AFTERNOON
Granny glares at Balram. An exhausted Kishan sits nearby with
his WIFE, BABY and 4 YEAR OLD who keeps poking Kishan.
BALRAM
I overheard them saying, they need
a second driver for Mr. Ashok, he’s
just come back KISHAN
But you don’t know how to drive!
BALRAM
I just need 300 rupees for the
driving lessons, and GRANNY
- No! You have always been
insolent, just like your father.
You’ll stay here with Kishan.
Kishan’s baby CRIES. The 4 year old smears dirt on Kishan’s
face. Balram stares at this like it is a misery.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Granny had married him off, given
him two weeks to dip his beak into
his wife, and now he was stuck
here. I would be too...

14.
BALRAM
Ok, forget it. I thought if I
became their driver, you’d buy a
bunch of water buffaloes, and be
the envy of the village.
GRANNY
So you’ll become a driver for the
landlords...?
BALRAM
Yes. You could be the richest woman
in the village.
GRANNY
(pulls out money)
Swear by all the gods in heaven
you’ll send every rupee you make
every month to your Granny.
I swear.

BALRAM

GRANNY
Stop smiling. Pinch your hand and
swear!
Balram grabs her cane and starts swinging it around.
BALRAM
I’m pinching! Granny, just think...
You’ll be the richest women in the
village! Your cane will become gold
and when you swing it like this...
the entire village will line up to
see you!
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME / LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - SUNRISE
Balram runs through the village carrying a small sack. He
hugs a water buffalo goodbye.
Kishan chases with a tiffin lunch box.
KISHAN
(holds tiffin box high)
Wait! Granny made your favorite!
BALRAM
You eat that oily lunch, I’m gonna
eat in Dhanbad!
He sprints down the dirt road and out of the village.

15.
INT./EXT. MOVING BUS / LANDSCAPE - SUNSET
The bus drives down the road.
Balram sits in the bus crowded with people, chickens, goats
and a band singing and playing music. He’s ecstatic, getting
out of the village to-SUPER TITLE: DHANBAD
EXT. DHANBAD STREETS; VARIOUS - DAY
A massive coal pit on the outskirts of a city covered in
black grime. Big, chaotic. Nothing like the village.
MEN and CHILDREN, blackened from coal, push bikes piled high
with sacks of stolen coal, or on their heads.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Now, I just had to learn to drive.
A taxi drives past KIDS carrying coal; we PAN WITH IT AND INT./EXT. MOVING TAXI / DHANBAD - DAY
- inside the taxi we find Balram DRIVING with joy! SMACK! AN OLD DRIVER in a brown uniform hits his head.
OLD DRIVER
Watch out, sister-fucker! You’re
from a caste of sweet-makers. Only
a boy from a warrior class can tame
a wild stallion. Muslims, Rajputs,
Sikhs, they have aggression in
their blood. Why don’t you stick to
sweets and tea, sugar-boy?
Balram deftly dodges traffic, BEGGARS. The Driver takes note.
OLD DRIVER
It’s not enough to drive. You’ve
got to become a driver. Anyone
tries to overtake you, do this (sticks fist out window)
Out of the way, sister-fucker!
Emboldened, Balram HONKS and speeds past a car BALRAM
Outta my way, sister-fucker!

16.
OLD DRIVER
The road is a jungle. A good driver
must roar to get ahead on it!
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - AFTERNOON
A luxury neighborhood. Balram strolls up to a gate guarding a
massive villa.
BALRAM (V.O.)
It wasn’t so hard to find out where
they lived. I just had to get
through the door.
He peers through the gate and is amazed by the Stork’s villa,
large yard of green grass and trees.
He sees Ram Persad (driver #1) waxing the Mitsubishi Pajero.
An older, small Honda City, gets his attention: a second car.
The GATEKEEPER, SAKET BAHADUR (50s), walks up.
Yeah?

SAKET BAHADUR

BALRAM
Namaste, sir.
SAKET BAHADUR
What do you want?
BALRAM
Any need of a driver, sir? I’ve got
four years experience. My master
recently died, so I SAKET BAHADUR
Fuck off. We have a driver already.
BALRAM
I see you have two cars, sir, but
do you have two drivers?
SAKET BAHADUR
What’s wrong with you? Get lost,
sister-fucker.
Balram sees the Stork and Ashok. He feigns surprise as he
calls out to them -

17.
BALRAM
Sir, this is your house? Namaste. I
am from your village, sir! I am
from Laxmangarh.
THE STORK
Laxmangarh?
BALRAM
Yes, sir! The gods must be watching
over us! I worked at the tea stall
and I would bring tea to your
ambassador car THE STORK
Let the boy in.
But, sir -

SAKET BAHADUR

THE STORK
Let him in.
As soon as Bahadur opens the gate, Balram pushes him aside
and dives at the Stork’s feet.
BALRAM
I can’t believe it’s you, sir. Oh,
how the crops died since you left,
and we prayed that you’d have more
sons to keep rule in the village THE STORK
Get up, son. - Do people there
still remember me?
BALRAM
Of course, sir. Everyone says, ‘Our
father is gone, the best and most
holy of the landlords - like
Gandhi!’
ASHOK
Like Gandhi?
BALRAM
Yes, sir, Mohandas Karamchand
Gandhi, sir.
THE STORK
Ok. What do you want?

18.
BALRAM
Sir, with your permission, I want
to be a driver for you, or for your
son.
THE STORK
Hmm. Are you a Muslim, boy?
BALRAM
No, sir! I bathe regularly, I’m not
lazy ASHOK
Hey, what’s up?
Ashok extends his hand. The Stork stops him.
THE STORK
Don’t do that. You need a driver.
Let’s go for a spin, see how good
this boy is.
INT./EXT. MOVING HONDA CITY / DHANBAD STREETS - DAY
Balram drives Ashok and the Stork in the back; Mukesh (the
Mongoose) eyes him from the front seat.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Just my luck - the Mongoose.
THE STORK
He drives well. What’s your caste?
BALRAM
Halwai, sir.
THE STORK
What caste is that, top or bottom?
BALRAM (V.O.)
In the old days, when India was the
richest nation on earth, there were
one thousand castes and destinies.
These days, there are just two
castes: Men with Big Bellies and
Men with Small Bellies.
Mukesh SMACKS Balram.
MUKESH
Are you stupid or what?

19.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And there are only two destinies:
eat or get eaten up.
BALRAM
Bottom, sir.
MUKESH
All our employees are top caste.
ASHOK
Why does his caste matter?
MUKESH
(annoyed with Ashok)- Do you drink?
BALRAM
No sir, in my caste we never drink.
MUKESH
Then what do you do? Steal? Halwai. Are you a sweet-maker?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
Is that why you’re so sweet to us?
ASHOK
You can cook?
BALRAM
Certainly, sir. I cook very well.
Very tasty sweets, Gulab jamuns,
laddoos, anything you desire.
ASHOK
The driver can cook too? Only in
India. Start tomorrow.
MUKESH
Not so fast. First we have to check
on his family - and how much do you
want?
BALRAM
Absolutely nothing, sir. You’re
like a father and mother to me. How
can I ask for money from my
parents?
MUKESH
1,500 a month.

20.
BALRAM
No, sir, please - it’s too much.
Give me half of that, it’s enough.
More than enough.
MUKESH
If we keep you beyond two months,
it’ll go to 2,000.
ASHOK
And you only drive me.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Balram HONKS and SHOUTS at a rickshaw trying to overtake
them. The Mongoose threatens to beat the rickshaw driver
while Ashok is upset Balram is honking so much [AD LIB].
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - AFTERNOON
The Housekeeper, Bahadur, SLAMS the gate on Balram.
SAKET BAHADUR
They haven’t hired you yet, hick!
Through the bars, Balram sees Ashok walking away. He then
looks at Mukesh making a call while eyeing him.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The Mongoose must have called his
man in Laxmangarh, because two days
later, when they did hire me, they
knew everything about my family.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - DAY [IN BALRAM’S MIND]
Balram’s FAMILY stands outside their home, like a portrait.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The pride and glory of our nation “the Indian family.”
Two THUGS watch from their car; one reports on the phone.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Every master has to know exactly
where their servants’ family live
at all times, just in case a
servant decides to steal from his
employer and run. If so -

21.
EXT. DHANBAD HOME - DAY [IN BALRAM’S MIND]
Balram, hands tied behind his back, stands against a wall. A
Thug SHOOTS him. Balram falls down - DEAD.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Fair enough. I would do the same.
EXT. VILLAGE; VARIOUS - DAY [IN BALRAM’S MIND]
The Two Thugs pull out knives and a gun and head towards the
family and their home.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But it’s what the masters do to
their servants’ families...
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
Our older Balram seems disturbed as he types at his laptop.
BALRAM (V.O.)
This is how the Rooster Coop works.
(stops typing)
This is how it traps so many
millions of men and women in India.
So rest assured, the Stork and his
sons could count on my loyalty.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DHANBAD - DAY [PAST]
Ram Persad shows Balram a small room with one bed.
RAM PERSAD
Here is your room.
BALRAM
I have a room, sir?
RAM PERSAD
You’ll share it with me. I can help
you find a mattress.
BALRAM
Thank you, sir, but I’m happy
sleeping on the floor - There’s
even a first class roof!
Persad hands Balram a uniform. Balram is in awe.

22.
RAM PERSAD
You need to wear this at all times.
BALRAM
My own uniform?
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DAY
Balram steps out into the sunny courtyard in his uniform. He
adjusts his collar, he feels proud.
Until - SMACK. Bahadur hits him on the back of the head and
shoves a rug into his chest - and points to a pile more.
SAKET BAHADUR
I hope you like carpets.
Sir?

BALRAM

SAKET BAHADUR
And when you’re done cleaning
those, wash all the windows. Got
it?
BALRAM
But I’m the driver, sir.
SAKET BAHADUR
No. You are the number two driver.
LATER - Under the hot sun, Balram beats the hanging carpet
with a stick - a cloud of dirt in his face. He sees Persad
playing badminton with Mukesh’s two KIDS.
LATER - Balram’s POV: the Mitsubishi’s leather seats, radio,
AC, chrome rims.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Is there any hatred on earth like
the hatred of the number two
servant for the number one?
Balram cleans the old Honda City and enviously watches Persad
wax the sleek Mitsubishi Pajero.
INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DAY
Balram cleans a chandelier in the massive villa and sees
Persad quietly crossing below.

23.
BALRAM (V.O.)
While I cleaned, he strolled about
like a master.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DHANBAD - MORNING
Balram spies on Persad praying to 20 Hindu idols.
BALRAM (V.O.)
He had every Hindu god lined up and
was always praying, as if to accuse
me of being a Naxal, a communist like you, sir.
Balram gets down and prays louder and harder than Persad.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I would not let him out-pray me.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - SUNSET
Balram eats with Bahadur and other SERVANTS. He notices
Persad leaving the servant’s quarters.
BALRAM
Sir, why is Ram Persad not eating?
(off Bahadur’s shrug)
And his mouth stinks these days.
SAKET BAHADUR
You keep your mouth shut.
Balram’s POV: Persad sneaks out of the gate. - Why?
BALRAM (V.O.)
This man was hiding something, and
a successful entrepreneur always
finds his competition’s secrets.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; TERRACE - DAY
Balram cleans the terrace table and notices PINKY with her
arms around Ashok, stretching his back (!). Ashok notices him
and Balram quickly looks away, scared.
ASHOK (O.S.)
Hey driver! Can you come here,
please.
Anxious, he sees Ashok waving him to come. So he-

24.
INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
- enters the bedroom, worried he will be reprimanded.
ASHOK
I wanted to ask you some questions PINKY MADAM
Wait - can you turn around. Go on.
Confused, Balram turns around.
PINKY MADAM
No, that’s not what I meant, come
back!... Wow, your hips are out of
alignment. - Ah, sorry, hi, I’m
Pinky, we haven’t met yet.
Balram’s too afraid to shake her hand and namaste’s instead.
She touches his hips which freaks Balram out.
PINKY MADAM
You’re probably stiff - sitting in
a car all day. I can adjust you
after Ashok.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I am ashamed to admit it now, sir,
but in that moment I thought Pinky
Madam was one of “those women.”
Ashok eyes Balram from toe to head.
ASHOK
All right, honey, I need to talk to
him. Ok, driver -- what’s your name
again?
BALRAM
Balram, sir. Balram Halwai!
ASHOK
Right, Balram. So, Balram, do you
know what the “internet” is?
BALRAM
No, sir. But, I can drive to the
market and get as many as you want.
ASHOK
No, it’s ok. Thank you. Do you have
Facebook?

25.
BALRAM
Yes, sir. I always loved books.
ASHOK
I heard you can read. Have you ever
seen a computer?
BALRAM
Yes, sir. We had many of them in
the fields of the village, sir,
with the goats.
ASHOK
Goats? They must be pretty advanced
to use computers.
PINKY MADAM
All right, that’s enough.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I could tell from their faces, I
had made a mistake.
ASHOK
You see, he’s got two, three years
schooling in him. He can read and
write, but he doesn’t get what he’s
read. He’s “half-baked.”
PINKY MADAM
Don’t be a jerk.
ASHOK
You’re missing the point. Our
driver represents the biggest
untapped market in India, waiting
to surf the web, buy a cell phone
and rise up into middle-class,
something I can help him do. - You
represent the new India, isn’t that
right?
BALRAM
(smiles)
Yes, sir. I’m the new India, sir.
ASHOK
You can leave now.
Balram’s smile fades.

26.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - NIGHT
Travel towards Balram, thinking.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I didn’t like the way he had spoken
about me, “half-baked,” but he was
right.
He watches Ashok and Pinky through their bedroom window.
BALRAM (V.O.)
When you come to India, sir, you’ll
meet hundreds of millions of men
like me. Open up our brown skulls
and look inside with a pen light.
EXT. DHANBAD STREETS / CYBER CAFE- NIGHT
Balram walks through Dhanbad. He finds a newspaper scrap and
reads it as he walks.
BALRAM (V.O.)
You’ll find all these ideas, half
formed, half correct, all buggering
one another - and that is what we
live and act on.
He finds a CYBER CAFE. He watches over someone’s shoulder.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Balram massages the Stork’s disgusting legs and feet.
THE STORK
Good boy. Higher, good.
The Stork drinks with Ashok and Mukesh; Balram eavesdrops.
ASHOK
India’s future is in outsourcing
with American companies.
MUKESH
Our future is China. They’re
building superhighways and need
coal. We sell coal.
ASHOK
I know, but I think we should
diversify. The IT sector is
booming, and the internet -

27.
THE STORK
- “The internet,” what is that?
Coal is real, I can touch it.
BALRAM
Sir, I learned from Mr. Ashok-sir
that the internet is as real as a
spider’s web, that it connects all
human beings Suddenly, Mukesh SMACKS Balram.
THE STORK
Do you know what that’s for, son?
Yes, sir.
For what?

BALRAM
MUKESH

BALRAM
For the internet, sir.
Mukesh SMACKS him again.
MUKESH
You’re pressing too hard. Father is
getting annoyed. Slow down.
ASHOK
Why do you hit the servants? In
America they can sue you for that.
THE STORK
This isn’t America. They respect us
for it. - Remember that.
Balram locks eyes with Ashok, who feels shame.
INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; BATHROOM - LATER
Balram pours the disgusting water into the toilet; flushes.
He washes his hands and smells them - awful.
He finds an air freshener, sprays his hands - smells good!
Sprays under his arms, his crotch. He notices the price tag:
Rs. 4,300 (twice his monthly salary)! Surprised, he puts it
back.

28.
INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; DINING ROOM - DAY
Mukesh (eating) slaps money into Balram’s hand.
MUKESH
Count it, I don’t want hear shit
later.
He counts and confirms.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I was only allowed to keep 200.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DAY
Balram hands Kishan money through the gate.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Granny sent Kishan each month to
take the rest back to her.
BALRAM
And they’re not from the same caste
and she’s a Christian.
KISHAN
And he married her?!
BALRAM
Yeah, that’s normal in America. Her
people were against it too, but he
wouldn’t listen.
KISHAN
But is she American?
BALRAM
No, no, she’s Indian. She was born
here, but moved there when she was
twelve. She told me.
KISHAN
She talks to you?!
BALRAM
Of course. She tells me everything.
I am their number one servant!
He looks at Balram with pride.
KISHAN
Are you serious?

29.

Yeah.

BALRAM

KISHAN
Can I come in?
No.
Why not?

BALRAM
KISHAN

BALRAM
Why not?! Mukesh Sir would scold
me.
INT./EXT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DHANBAD - NIGHT
Balram sleeps. Tak tak tak. He wakes up: Persad isn’t in bed.
OUTSIDE: Balram sneaks around the corner: Persad chops
vegetables under a bare bulb - Why?
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - SUNRISE
Persad sneaks out the back of the home. Balram follows him.
EXT. DHANBAD STREETS / MOSQUE - MORNING
Balram follows Persad through a couple streets. Then, he sees
Persad take off his shoes and enter - a mosque!
BALRAM (V.O.)
What a fool I had been. It was
Ramadan. He can’t eat and drink
during the day. The number one
driver was a Muslim. And the Stork,
hated Muslims.
PERSAD’S HOME - LATER: Balram spies on Persad who gives MONEY
to his FAMILY. He picks up his son and smiles.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DAY
Balram sees: Bahadur opens the gate and several government
cars enter. A MAN IN WHITE exits with a Great Socialist flag,
followed by BODYGUARDS and STAFF. THE GREAT SOCIALIST exits.

30.
MAN IN WHITE
As long as there is a sun and a
moon, madam’s name will remain!
Long live the Madam, long live
socialism.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I almost fell down. There was the
woman I had seen on a million
election posters since I was a boy.
The Great Socialist.
Stork and Mukesh bow as Ashok puts a garland of flowers
around the Socialist’s neck, who squeezes Ashok’s cheeks.
GREAT SOCIALIST
(to the Stork)
I’m glad your son returned. We need
more boys to come home and build
India into a superpower.
INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - LATER
Balram “dusts” and spies on them arguing [AD LIB].
BALRAM (V.O.)
(re the Great Socialist)
She was a low caste like me and
everyone from the Darkness. Like a
good entrepreneur, she had pulled
herself up to become Chief Minister
of our state. She knew how to stick
it to the rich, and we liked her
for that.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
You take coal from government mines
without paying taxes, because I let
that happen.
THE STORK
And we have shown our appreciation,
madam. But two million rupees is a
lot. We’ll be happy to come to The Great Socialist notices Balram and waves him over.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
Son! Come here, son. Come on.
Shocked, Balram is wary; the family is confused.

31.
THE STORK
Come here you fucker!
Balram comes forward.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
Your rich employers are trying to
bugger me, what do you say to that?
MUKESH
Driver, get lost.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
Shut up, sister-fucker!
Balram and the family can’t believe it. Mukesh turns red.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
You don’t want to pay taxes? Then
pay me. I said two million and I
mean it.
She spits red paan on their floor, shocking them all.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
Otherwise, back to Laxmangarh where
I first found you hicks!
INT./EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD; COURTYARD - NIGHT
The Stork and his sons drink. Balram sweeps and eavesdrops.
MUKESH
Why pay that small time sisterfucker? Let’s go straight to Delhi
and pay off the opposing party.
She’s going to lose the next
election.
ASHOK
I agree. Papa, I was thinking, I
want to go to Delhi.
THE STORK
You’ll stay here and learn the
family business. Let your brother
and I handle this.
PINKY MADAM
Excuse me, papa, you should not
have been disrespected today -

32.
ASHOK
Honey, please PINKY MADAM
Shhh! - Delhi is an international
city like New York, and it needs
someone with Ashok’s expertise in MUKESH
Hey, Ashok, tell her this is not a
place for her to talk.
PINKY MADAM
Excuse me? I’m standing right here.
I am a doctor of chiropractic with
a DPT from NYU MUKESH
Pieces of paper are good for
hanging on bedroom walls - where
she belongs.
PINKY MADAM
You know what? Ashok and I are
going to Delhi, we’re going to fix
your tax FRAUD problem, and then
we’ll mail you a postcard.
Balram watches in awe as Pinky argues with Mukesh [AD LIB]
and Ashok tries to appease.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Where did Pinky Madam’s aggression
come from? She didn’t care about
traditions.
EXT./INT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - NIGHT
Balram spies on Mukesh handing money to a happy Persad.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And when the number one driver got
a bonus to drive my master to
Delhi...
INT. BALRAM'S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS
Balram pensive at his laptop.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I did something... I wish I did not
have to tell you.

33.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DAY
Balram whistles and washes the Mitsubishi. Persad approaches.
RAM PERSAD
What are you doing?
BALRAM
I’ve got to make the Mitsubishi
look perfect for when I drive my
master and mistress to Delhi.
RAM PERSAD
You’re mistaken. I’m taking them to
Delhi.
BALRAM
Really? To visit all the mosques
there, sir?
RAM PERSAD
... - Get away from that.
He tries to take the sponge away - Balram refuses.
BALRAM
I don’t think Mukesh-sir wants to
give a 3,000 rupee raise to
Mohammad Mohammad, or whatever your
name is.
Persad’s fears are confirmed.
RAM PERSAD
Please, sir, I’ve been their driver
for over 20 years. Mr. Ashok is
like my own son, I drove him to
school when he was a boy...
BALRAM
That’s a good point... But only
Allah knows what corrupt ideas you
put into my poor master’s mind!
RAM PERSAD
Please, sir, I have a family.
BALRAM
... Don’t we all.
EXT. ASHOK’S HOME IN DHANBAD - DUSK
Balram looks through the gate at Persad leaving with a bag.

34.
BALRAM (V.O.)
What a miserable life, having to
hide his religion and name just to
get a job as a servant. I wanted to
run to him and apologize, ‘You go
be their driver in Delhi. Forgive
me brother.’
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DHANBAD - MOMENTS LATER
Balram enters. Persad’s belongings are gone, except his Hindu
idols. Balram collects them into a satchel and -BALRAM (V.O.)
You never know when they’ll come in
handy!
EXT./INT. HIGHWAY TO DELHI / MOVING MITSUBISHI - DAY
The glorious Mitsubishi speeds past buses. Stickers of Hindu
gods are now freshly stuck on the dashboard. Balram - with a
big smile - drives Ashok (front seat), Pinky... and Mukesh.
Balram’s POV: sweaty PASSENGERS hang on the doors and roof of
puttering bus next to him. Balram SHOUTS at them:
BALRAM
I’m going to Delhi in a car - in an
air-conditioned car!
Passengers stare at Balram, who did not really shout this. He
looks at Ashok and smiles; Ashok smiles back.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / VARIOUS DELHI - DAY
Wide-eyed, Balram gawks at DELHI. It’s massive! Large treelined boulevards, majestic government buildings. Cows,
autorickshaws and beggar kids crowd the roads - chaos.
Balram slams on the brakes, HONKS and swerves around HOMELESS
FAMILY with KIDS who jut through heavy traffic.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / GURGAON - DUSK
Balram looks up at the giant, luxury apartments.

35.
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
Balram unloads the suitcases and looks up at the towering
apartment buildings - their new home. His masters enter.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Balram’s first elevator ride with a cart full of luggage. He
watches the numbers.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
Balram enters with the luggage and is startled by the wealth
and expansive views. Ashok is happy that Pinky likes it.
Wow.

PINKY MADAM

ASHOK
Not bad, right? Check out the view.
Balram put the bags down anywhere.
Balram can’t believe the view, how high they are. He has
never been in a skyrise.
BALRAM
Wow, look, the sky!
MUKESH
You want to see a shooting star?
(smacks Balram)
Put the bags down exactly in the
rooms I tell you and then get this
place cleaned up.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Mukesh eyes Balram as he sets the bags down.
EXT. ASHOK'S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
Balram drives the car down to the garage.
BALRAM (V.O.)
After making dinner for Mr Ashok, I
took the car down to the garage.
That’s where all the servants
lived, including the drivers.

36.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; SERVANT’S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Balram follows VITILIGO-LIPS - a driver with pink lips in a
dark-skinned face - who shows him the servant’s quarters. Two
DRIVERS follow and sometimes heckle Balram [AD LIB].
VITILIGO-LIPS
The main thing to know about Delhi
is the roads are good, the people
are bad, and the police, totally
rotten. (points) The masters’
clothes get washed here and sent
back up. Toilets are here. This is
the phone when your master calls
you, there’s even a temple in case
you want to pray.
He shows Balram where the drivers hang out.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Here is our den of sin. When we
have money, we play cards here.
BALRAM (V.O.)
This driver had a disease called
vitiligo that made him look like a
clown. It made my stomach churn.
As Vitiligo leads Balram to his room, he slaps a mosquito
dead.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Watch out. The mosquitoes’ll eat
you alive. If they’re malaria
mosquitoes you’ll just be raving
for weeks; but if it’s dengue
mosquitoes, I swear on my mother
you’ll shiver all over and die for
sure.
BALRAM
Die from a mosquito?
VITILIGO-LIPS
Definitely. - Here’s your room.
Balram sees a small room with a bed.
BALRAM
Who do I share this with?
VITILIGO-LIPS
You plan on bringing your family?

37.

No.

BALRAM

VITILIGO-LIPS
Then what? You want to fuck some
whores here?
No.

BALRAM

VITILIGO-LIPS
Huh? How’s your little guy?
He strokes at Balram’s cock.
VITILIGO-LIPS
- So tell me, Country-Mouse, how
much are they paying you?
BALRAM
Enough. I’m happy.
VITILIGO-LIPS
You’re a sweet, loyal dog.
Then he moves closer to Balram, who backs up.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I tilted my body as far as I could
from his face.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Does your master need anything?
Foreign wine? I have a friend at an
embassy. He’ll hook it all up. Golf
balls? Women?
BALRAM
My master doesn’t do those things.
He’s a good man.
VITILIGO-LIPS
A “good” man? He’s a “rich” man.
INT. BALRAM'S ROOM; DELHI - LATER
Balram writes his name on the wall in chalk, proud to have
his very own room.

38.
EXT. ASHOK'S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
Balram counts the balconies of the apt towers, amazed such a
thing exists.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
Balram opens the door for Ashok and Mukesh, who carries a RED
LEATHER BAG.
MUKESH
National Party headquarters.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Ashok stops Balram from closing the door for him.
ASHOK
No worries.
BALRAM
Please, sir.
ASHOK
No, seriously dude, I got it.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI STREETS - DAY
Balram drives the brothers through traffic.
BALRAM (V.O.)
For the next few days I drove Mr.
Ashok, the Mongoose and a red bag
to see various government
officials.
EXT. NATIONAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Balram arrives. The brothers get out with the RED BAG and
shake hands with party members. Balram looks around.
BALRAM (V.O.)
“Democracy,” something that you
yellow-skinned men, despite your
triumphs in sewage, drinking water,
and Olympic gold medals, still
don’t have. If I were in charge of
India, I’d get the sewage pipes
first, then the democracy.

39.
LATER - Mukesh and Ashok return. Balram opens the doors.
MUKESH
To the President’s House. Get
moving.
Ashok tries to stop Balram again from opening the door.
ASHOK
Please dude, I got it. Ah...
INT. MITSUBISHI / BANK - DAY
Balram’s POV: the brothers put cash into a leather bag.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI STREETS - DAY
Balram misses the turn - Mukesh SMACKS him.
MUKESH
That was our exit, idiot! Turn
around.
ASHOK
What’s wrong with you? Don’t do
that. Relax.
MUKESH
We need to dump him and get a local
who knows Delhi.
ASHOK
We just got here. Remember when you
came to New York - you couldn’t
even find 42nd street.
He touches Balram’s shoulder; Balram tingles.
ASHOK
You’ll figure it out, don’t worry.
BALRAM (V.O.)
It was the first time he touched
me.
BALRAM
Sorry, sir.
He locks eyes with Ashok in the rear-view mirror. Connection.

40.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / PRESIDENT’S HOUSE - DAY
Balram is dwarfed by the President’s House and other massive
government buildings. He takes it in. Impressive.
LATER - Balram sees Ashok and Mukesh exit with THE MINISTER’S
SIDEKICK; they talk and shake hands. Ashok sulks.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Why was Mr. Ashok upset? If I had
gone into the President’s House I
would be shouting: “Balram was
here, Balram was here!”
He opens the door for sullen Ashok, who allows it this time.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - AFTERNOON
Balram drives the brothers and notices Ashok remains sullen.
MUKESH
You’ll keep visiting them while I’m
gone. And don’t let them push you
for more money.
Look

ASHOK

Balram looks out the window and sees Gandhi and the Dandi
March statue.
ASHOK
We’re driving past Mahatma Gandhi,
after just having given a bribe to
a minister. The world’s biggest
democracy. It’s a fucking joke.
MUKESH
You sound like your wife.
ASHOK
Don’t talk about her.
MUKESH
I hope your “madam” knows you’re
staying on in India?... Ashok?
Balram keeps an eye on Ashok.

41.
EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - MORNING
Balram buys dosa from a stall. He removes the potatoes as he
carries them to Mukesh who waits with Ashok at the train.
BALRAM (V.O.)
A good servant must know his
masters from end to end - from lips
to anus.
BALRAM
Here you are, sir. I removed all
the potatoes.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And potatoes made the Mongoose
fart.
MUKESH
Ah, you have a good memory.
Balram smiles.
MUKESH
Give my brother a reading of the
meter each day so we know you don’t
drive without permission and try
and fuck the maid.
(off Balram’s laugh - he
hits him)
What the hell are you laughing at?
The police have put cameras in the
eyes of all the statues in Delhi,
so they’re watching you, got it?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
And the air conditioner and music
should be turned off when you’re on
your own.
ASHOK
All right, who cares about the air
conditioner.
MUKESH
If you give them air conditioning
they will sit on your head, and
then fuck you in the ear, trust me.

42.
ASHOK
You’re gonna miss the train. Come
on.
Balram watches Ashok pull his brother to the train door.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Once the Mongoose left, Mr. Ashok
would be my only master. In
Laxmangarh we would have called him
“the Lamb.”
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI - DAY
MUSIC plays. Balram drives Ashok who smokes a joint in the
back seat and texts on his phone. The SONG changes and ASHOK
Dude, I love this song, turn it up.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

ASHOK
Mukesh isn’t here, turn it up!
TIME SLOWS DOWN FOR BALRAM as Ashok leans over him to turn up
the music.
BALRAM (V.O.)
My master’s fruit-flavored perfume
rushed into my nostrils.
ASHOK
You like this?
BALRAM
Oh yes, sir.
He sees Ashok bob his head to the music and does the same.
ASHOK
(re the joint)
Don’t tell anyone, not even Pinky.
BALRAM
Of course, sir. Everything between
master and servant is a secret.
ASHOK
I’m not your master, don’t say
things like that.

43.

Yes, sir.

BALRAM

ASHOK
And stop calling me, sir. My name
is Ashok. Call me Ashok.
Ashok.

BALRAM

ASHOK
Yes, Ashok. I know it’s not the
best name in the world, but you
gotta live with it.
BALRAM
No sir, it is a really good name.
ASHOK
Really? You like it?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

ASHOK
You can keep it then.
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; TENNIS COURTS - DAY
Ashok practices his serve while Balram dodges balls and
gathers them into a bucket.
BALRAM
You should represent India in the
Olympics!
He chases another ball.
BALRAM
Sometimes I wish I had arms like
you, sir.
Ashok slams another serve.
ASHOK
Would you be quiet please?
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GAME ROOM - AFTERNOON
They sit before a big TV playing video games. Ashok tries to
teach him [AD-LIB]. Balram is transfixed by Ashok.

44.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I had never seen a man so happy in
the Darkness.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Balram finishes cleaning dishes. He hears some noises.
He tiptoes to Ashok’s closed bedroom door and eavesdrops:
Pinky Madam and Ashok are fucking. Balram laughs to himself.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The “lamb” still had the blood of a
landlord in him after all.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / MALL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON
An impressive, luxury mall. Balram pulls up to the GUARDED
entrance. He watches Ashok and Pinky enter.
EXT./INT. MALL PARKING LOT / MITSUBISHI- AFTERNOON
Balram stands with Vitiligo and other DRIVERS who smoke, chew
paan, and pass around a pulp magazine (MURDER WEEKLY).
VITILIGO-LIPS
This magazine is great for when
you’re lonely or upset with your
master. It has revenge, sex,
murder, rape all the good stuff.
You can really enjoy yourself.
Balram gawks at a SEXY RICH WOMAN coming out of the mall.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Country mouse, you like it? Big
tits, huge asses. Hold them like
mangos and nibble with your teeth.
And suck ‘em right up!
BALRAM
(giggles nervously)
What’s he talking about?
He runs his hand over Balram’s cock.
VITILIGO-LIPS
But don’t let your little mouse get
sucked up in their dark caves! Want
me to put in a good word?

45.
BALRAM
I noticed how the ladies here don’t
have hair in their armpits or legs.
Vitiligo and the other drivers start laughing in disbelief.
VITILIGO-LIPS
What? Does your mom have hair here
or here?
He grabs Balram’s chest and cock while the drivers all laugh
at him. Upset, Balram shoves his hand away.
DRIVERS
Are all the women in your village
hairy beasts?
BALRAM
Why talk about mothers and sisters?
VITILIGO-LIPS
Did your family all hang from the
trees and fuck like monkeys?
They crack up, poking fun at Balram.
BALRAM
Do I talk about your mothers and
sisters?
He walks away from them as they laugh.
BALRAM (V.O.)
There and then I resolved never
again to tell anyone in Delhi
anything I was thinking.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; SERVANT’S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Balram exits his room with his bag and sees Vitiligo and the
servants (drunk, playing cards) still LAUGHING at him.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Where you going, to die? It’s just
a joke, come on!
Balram walks away. He sees an OLD JANITOR sweeping.
BALRAM
Is there a room I can sleep in?
Where I can be alone?

46.
OLD JANITOR
Over there, but who wants to live
alone?
Balram walks that way.
INT./EXT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - CONTINUOUS
He finds an abandoned storage room, disgusting with a cot and
mosquito net. He sets his bag down. This is his new home.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
MOVING: vast, beautiful country. Balram drives. In the back,
Pinky Madam shoots video with her Motorola Razr flip-phone.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Pinky Madam wanted to go to
Laxmangarh, and so here I was,
driving home, in the Stork’s car!
Pinky leans over Balram to take photos and her breasts rub
over him.
PINKY MADAM
Look how beautiful!
BALRAM (V.O.)
I hated her for this. If I crashed,
it would be her fault.
PINKY MADAM
Balram, are you happy to see your
granny?
BALRAM
Very happy, madam.
ASHOK
Balram, what did you just do? -You touched your finger to your
eye. Did we pass something holy?
BALRAM
(lies)
Yes, sir. We just passed a sacred
tree. I was offering my respects.
PINKY MADAM
Really? Where?

47.
BALRAM
There, Madam. Yes, this is a very
holy area.
ASHOK
See how they worship nature. Who
would do this in New York?
PINKY MADAM
People in Brooklyn with a backyard?
ASHOK
He did it again. What was that for?
BALRAM
That’s a holy path, sir, where the
Lord Buddha walked until he found
the tree of enlightenment. Pardon
me, but you and Madam should really
do the same. It’s very important.
If you don’t, you will become
infertile.
What? No!

ASHOK

PINKY MADAM
You better do this right now.
Ashok and Pinky each touch their eye; Balram instructs them
how to do it properly [AD LIB]. They laugh, have fun.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I gave them reactions of piety for
every tree, rock and temple we
passed. I was like a Sadhu to them.
He slyly smirks at them.
EXT. ASHOK’S FAMILY’S HOME - LATER
The FAMILY greets Ashok and Pinky with garlands; SERVANTS
touch his feet. Ashok touches his UNCLE’s feet.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I dropped them off at Mr. Ashok’s
Uncle’s villa. We called him, “the
Buffalo.”
Balram’s mood changes.

48.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Then I knew, I had to face my
family.
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME - LATER
KIDS chase the car as Balram drives up. The family and
NEIGHBORS have gathered. He parks and proudly exits as the
kids touch the car and admire his uniform.
Kishan and Granny stand at a distance and coldly stare at
him. Anxious, Balram touches Kishan’s feet.
BALRAM
How’s it going brother?
KISHAN
Now he remembers his family. You
haven’t sent money home since you
went to Delhi.
BALRAM
Forgive me, brother. I’m here now.
GRANNY
My grandson is a big shot but he
still forces his granny to do all
his work for him. This is the fate
of an old woman in this world.
Balram touches his Granny’s feet and gives them sweets.
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME - LATER
Family gathered for lunch. Balram sees Kishan counting the
money; his BABY crawls between him and his wife.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I wanted to bring him to Delhi and
save him from all this.
GRANNY
Eat the chicken. I made it myself.
You haven’t had any like it in
ages.
She serves Balram lunch, some wretched chicken curry.
BALRAM
Mr. Ashok Sir, is a vegetarian.

49.
GRANNY
America made him completely lose
his mind.
BALRAM
I’m thinking of doing the same.
GRANNY
Huh? You think you’re a Brahmin?
Eat. You’ve gotten thin. You need
to be plump for your wedding.
BALRAM
Whose marriage?
GRANNY
Yours! We’ve found a girl for you.
You’ll be married by the end of the
year.
BALRAM
I need more time. I’m not ready to
be married.
GRANNY
What does that mean? Now eat your
chicken. I made it just for you.
She pushes his lunch closer.
BALRAM
I don’t want to marry.
He pushes the food back. The family goes silent. A face off.
GRANNY
Stop thinking of yourself and think
of the family.
(pushes food back to him)
Eat.
No.

BALRAM

GRANNY
You’re not your master, Mr. Ashok.
Now eat.
Balram boils. He pushes the plate, sending the food flying.
BALRAM
Did you not understand? Are you
going to force me? I don’t want to
get married!

50.
He gets up and leaves.
BALRAM
You’re driving me insane.
Kishan chases him and grabs his arm.
KISHAN
What’re you doing? You can’t leave.
Balram shakes his arm free and walks to the car.
KISHAN
You have to send money home.
I won’t.

BALRAM

KISHAN
It’s the family’s money.
BALRAM
She’s sucked the blood out of you
and left you a shell. And she’ll
leave you to die, like Dad.
He gets in the car and slams the door closed.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / COUNTRY SIDE - DAY
Balram drives Ashok and Pinky.
EXT. RICE FIELD BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY
Pan across expansive rice fields. Ashok and Balram pee.
(Ashok, texting on his phone). Pinky asleep in the car.
ASHOK
“Why don’t I eat meat? Why does
Pinky wears pants? Why don’t we
have kids.” They wouldn’t stop.
BALRAM
I think we shouldn’t go back there,
sir.
Ashok’s surprised Balram has spoken, but he agrees.

51.
ASHOK
...Maybe. - Did you know one in
every three buildings in India is
being built in Bangalore. You know
why? “Outsourcing” with America.
BALRAM
“Diversifying,” sir?
ASHOK
Yeah, right. Good Balram... I’m
thinking to offer financial
services to Wall Street firms I
know.
BALRAM
Why don’t I drive you to Bangalore
right now.
Now?
Yes, sir.

ASHOK
BALRAM

ASHOK
Well, it’s on the other side of the
country.
BALRAM
I’ll drive all night, I don’t need
sleep, sir.
ASHOK
... I gotta make a business plan
first, do it the right way.
BALRAM
You’ll do it, sir.
Balram watches Ashok walk back to the car, texting.
BALRAM (V.O.)
If only Mr. Ashok was a real
entrepreneur, if only we had left
for Bangalore that very day...
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
Older Balram types at his laptop under maps of Bangalore.

52.
BALRAM (V.O.)
... then things would have turned
out differently for us
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
Balram sees Ashok texting on his phone in the back seat.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Rich men are born with
opportunities they can waste. But a
poor man...?
SLOW MO: Balram sees SCHOOL KIDS in uniforms with BOOKS enter
an IMPRESSIVE SCHOOL.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - DAY
Pinky talks with her FRIEND.
PINKY MADAM
Are we going back to New York or
staying here?
PINKY’S FRIEND
You need to talk to him, put your
foot down.
PINKY MADAM
He won’t talk, he’s just vague-Balram brings in a tray of tea -PINKY MADAM
Balram! What are you doing?
BALRAM
Bringing your ginger teas, madam.
PINKY MADAM
No. With your hand.
Balram looks down and sees he is scratching his groin.
PINKY’S FRIEND
That’s disgusting.
PINKY MADAM
Your uniform is filthy. And your
mouth, the paan, - Get rid of this
tea and get away. Go.

53.
He takes the tea and leaves.
PINKY MADAM
Ugh, sorry about that.
PINKY’S FRIEND
These lower caste, they are all the
same.
LATER - Pinky shows her cousin out. She thinks for a beat.
PINKY MADAM
Balram, come here.
Balram enters.
PINKY MADAM
I want to talk. Sit down.
BALRAM
I’m really sorry, Madam, I’ll stop
eating paan.
PINKY MADAM
Just sit down. Sit.
Nervous, Balram sits. She sits next to him.
PINKY MADAM
It’s wrong that you work for us
like this. You should be finishing
your education and starting a
family.
BALRAM
You and Mr. Ashok are my family
now, madam.
PINKY MADAM
That’s not true. Don’t say that.
BALRAM
But I like serving you. Nothing
makes me happier PINKY MADAM
You can’t possibly believe that...
Do you know what my mom and dad do
in America? They run a shitty
bodega in Jackson Heights selling
beer, paan, and porn. I did my
homework in the basement.
(MORE)

54.
PINKY MADAM (CONT'D)
One night I saw my mom held up at
gunpoint and she still worked that
entire night. She taught me to
never give up, and I made it out.
So, what about you? Huh? What do
you want to do?
BALRAM
... I want to serve you and Mr.
Ashok SirPINKY MADAM
No! Stop saying that! No. This is
exactly why the caste system is
total shit. The kind of shit Mukesh
believes in. He tried to stop Ashok
from marrying me! Yeah. Fuck him...
fuck this.. KITCHEN - LATER
Balram picks up a silver tray and looks at his warped
reflection. He flashes his teeth: stained from paan. His
uniform: filthy. She was right, he’s a dirty hick.
EXT. STREET MARKET - NIGHT
Balram buys toothpaste (SHAKTI WHITENER TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH)
black shoes, and a shirt (like Ashok wears) from MEN hawking
their goods in a busy market
INT. DELHI APARTMENT; SERVANT’S QUARTERS; BATHROOM - NIGHT
He looks at his teeth - stained with paan. Brush, rinse,
spit, look, repeat.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Why had my father never told me not
to scratch my groin? Why had he
never taught me to brush my teeth?
He looks at his foamy teeth - still stained.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Why had he raised me to live like
such an animal?
Balram rinses and SPITS. He stares at his teeth in the
mirror, still stained with paan. He brushes even harder.

55.
BALRAM (V.O.)
If only a man could spit his past
out so easily.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - CONTINUOUS
Balram sleeps under the mosquito net. A CLICKING sound wakes
him. He sees cockroaches crawling all over the net. He calmly
crushes one between his fingers... DEAD.
BALRAM (V.O.)
If you ask me to explain how one
event connects to another, or how
one motive strengthens or weakens
the next - I will tell you I don’t
understand these things.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
A match lights up the dark and burns the poster with Balram’s
face on it... all the way to the words: WANTED FOR MURDER.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I should warn you, my story gets
much darker from here.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT [PAST]
Ashok opens the door: Balram dressed as a maharaja (like the
opening scene) with balloons and a tray of pizza boxes. He
bows to Pinky.
BALRAM
Happy birthday, madam. Allow me to
serve you, your highness.
PINKY MADAM
Oh god, this is beautiful, thank
you Ashoky. Welcome Maharaja!
EXT. CONNAUGHT PLACE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Still dressed as a maharaja, Balram bobs his head to the
faint music and flashing lights of a disco club. He sees
Vitiligo and the other drivers smoking and chewing paan.

56.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Country-Mouse! Don’t stand there
alone. It leads to bad thoughts.
He declines to go to them.
DRIVER #1
What a snob, look at him, dressed
like the maharaja of England!
DRIVER #2
How’s the new room maharaja? Are
you the king of the roaches?
The drivers LAUGH. Angry, Balram turns away from them.
LATER - INSIDE THE CAR
A drunk Ashok and Pinky come out of the club and see Balram
asleep in the car. They come to his window and Pinky BANG
BANG BANGS her hands on the window startling Balram awake.
PINKY MADAM
Oh my god, I think he just shat his
pants.
They burst into laughter at him as he scrambles to open the
doors for them.
BALRAM
I must have dozed off.
ASHOK
Come on, don’t cry.
They continue to rib him [AD LIB].
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - NIGHT
Balram drives and watches the rear-view mirror: Ashok and
Pinky make out. He rubs his crotch with his hand.
Ashok catches Balram watching them. A sexually charged beat
for Balram before he looks away.
ASHOK
Stop, stop... We’re not alone.
PINKY MADAM
It’s just Balram.
She pulls him back in, but he resists.

57.
PINKY MADAM
You’re so boring.
ASHOK
You’re drunk.
PINKY MADAM
Not drunk enough. I want to go back
to New York.
ASHOK
Not this again.
PINKY MADAM
“Again?” What “again?” You won’t
even talk about it. I agreed to six
months in India, and then we would
decide.
ASHOK
I’m trying to help my family PINKY MADAM
Let’s not talk about them now. God,
you’re a nonentity around them.
Like skim milk.... Nobody likes
skim milk.
Balram sees Ashok is defeated.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS
Balram stops at a red light. A TAP at the window: a BEGGAR
CHILD tries to sell a Buddha statue (from the opening scene).
Pinky unrolls her window.
BEGGAR CHILD
Only 100 rupees, please madam, I’m
hungry, please.
PINKY MADAM
Oh, hi precious. Can I see that?
The Beggar Child gives her the statue, then shows more.
BEGGAR CHILD
If you buy three it’s only 200,
please.
PINKY MADAM
What’s your name?

58.
BEGGAR CHILD
Khushnuma, please 200 madam, I’m
hungry.
The Child holds her hand out for money. Pinky’s heart melts.
BALRAM
Don’t touch the car.
PINKY MADAM
Don’t say that. That’s awful.
BALRAM
Sorry, madam.
She pays 200 to the beggar child and smiles. The kid runs
off. The light turns green and Pinky squeezes Balram’s
shoulder.
PINKY MADAM
Stop the car, Balram. Get out. You
can’t speak to a kid like that.
He looks at Ashok.
ASHOK
She’s the boss.
Pinky gets out and opens Balram’s door. Balram gets out, she
gets in; Ashok gets into the front passenger seat. Pinky
hands Balram the Buddha statue.
PINKY MADAM
We’re leaving you with your Buddha
for the night.
BALRAM
Madam, I think it would be best if She squeezes his cheek and flirts:
PINKY MADAM
The maharaja and the Buddha. So
cute. I love you, Balram.
She floors it. They laugh and wave as Pinky speeds away.
ASHOK
Goodbye, Balraaaaam!
Balram looks around. Nothing in the dark night. He sits on
the curb. He sees HOMELESS huddled near garbage. A stray dog
wanders around. The wind blows through Balram. He looks up at
the moon, he sees leaves blowing in the trees.

59.
Balram’s POV: the statue of Buddha in his hand.
BALRAM (V.O.)
What is a servant without a master?
LATER - He sees the Mitsubishi’s headlights coming at him. He
gets up. Pinky Madam SCREECHES to halt a foot from him.
Pinky and Ashok get out, laughing.
ASHOK
That was awesome!
PINKY MADAM
Thought we had really left you
behind?
No, madam.

BALRAM

PINKY MADAM
You’re not angry, are you?
BALRAM
Not at all. Master and mistress are
like mother and father to me. How
can one be angry with them?
ASHOK
I’m not your father, don’t call me
that.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Ashok opens the back door and bows to Balram.
ASHOK
And no more “sir!” We’re all
friends, right?
Yes, ss--

BALRAM

Ashok puts his hand on Balram’s mouth.
ASHOK
No! Get in, let’s go, let’s have
some fun!
Ashok pulls Balram in -- Pinky Madam screeches off.

60.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - CONTINUOUS
Pinky drives fast, erratic. “Beware of the Boys,” plays
again. -- WE HAVE CAUGHT UP TO THE OPENING SCENE.
Balram looks out the window: the Dandi March statue.
PINKY MADAM
Should I switch to tequila now?
She swerves around an oncoming rickshaw.
Balram’s POV: her eyes flirt with him in the rear-view
mirror.
Ashok grabs the wheel to help her swerve around a cow in the
road. They laugh.
BALRAM’S POV: HOMELESS on the roadside watch the car fly by.
Ashok sings to Pinky and they drunkenly laugh.
ASHOK
Happy birthday to you, happy
birthday to you!
Then, A SMALL FIGURE darts in front of the car.
BALRAM
Look out, look out!
PINKY SMASHES RIGHT INTO IT and drives over it. She keeps
driving for a beat...
...then stops, her hands frozen to the wheel in shock. Balram
looks out the back window and sees something in the road.
Balram gets out. Ashok follows.
EXT. MITSUBISHI / STREET - CONTINUOUS
Balram looks down the street: THE LUMP IN THE ROAD IS A
CHILD. Ashok comes out and approaches Balram.
BALRAM
Sir, sir, we need to leave, sir.
ASHOK
We need to take him to the
hospital.

61.
BALRAM
Pinky madam will be in trouble,
sir.
Pinky gets out and sees the same.
ASHOK
(pulls out his phone)
I’m gonna call the cops.
BALRAM
No, sir, what’re you doing?
(he sees Pinky approach)
Pinky Madam, sir ASHOK
Please go back to the car.
PINKY MADAM
Is it a kid? Oh god, we need to
call an ambulance.
They move her back to the car, to the back seat.
ASHOK
I’ll do it, just stay in the car,
please.
PINKY MADAM
Is it alive?...
BALRAM
If we don’t leave right now Pinky
Madam will be in trouble, sir...
someone will see us, please sir.
Ashok and Pinky are a mess. Balram pushes them into the car.
BALRAM
Please get in the car, sir.
He closes the door, gets in the front and speeds away.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - CONTINUOUS
Balram drives away; he sees Pinky, hysterical in the back,
Ashok trying to calm her.
PINKY MADAM
We have to call the police. Stop
the car. Make him stop.
She flails, Ashok holds her tight.

62.
ASHOK
Calm down, calm down, honey,
please.
PINKY MADAM
I killed a kid, I killed a kid, god
please, We have to go back, please.
She grabs at Balram, but Ashok holds her back. She’s weeping.
ASHOK
Please honey, please.
PINKY MADAM
We have to see if it’s alive.
Balram watches them in the rear-view mirror.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GARAGE - LATER
In the dark corner of the garage: Balram (in his normal
clothes again) sees blood on the tires and fender. He scrubs
them with a rag and bucket.
He finds a bloody fabric. Ashok approaches and sees it.
ASHOK
What is that?
BALRAM
Stuff those kids wear, sir.
ASHOK
What was he doing in the street at
two in the morning?
BALRAM
Exactly. It’s not our fault. It
just jumped in our way, stupid kid.
ASHOK
Don’t call him stupid.
BALRAM
Sorry, sir.
ASHOK
... What am I going to do?

63.
BALRAM
Nothing, sir. You know how those
people are: they have ten, twenty
kids, they don’t even know their
names. No one will miss this one,
sir.
ASHOK
What if someone reports it?
BALRAM
I don’t think so, sir. The street
was empty. And the parents, even if
they’re in Delhi - the police won’t
let people like that into the
station.
ASHOK
I shouldn’t have listened to her.
BALRAM
Don’t worry, sir. Please, it’s been
a difficult night for you, sir. Go
up and rest, I’ll take care of
this.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT
Balram lies in bed with a smile.
BALRAM (V.O.)
On my lips there was a big,
contented smile that comes to a
servant who has done his duty by
his master even in the most
difficult of moments.
He turns and sees the BUDDHA STATUE. His smile fades.
EXT./INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - MORNING
Balram burns incense inside the Mitsubishi. He steps back and
stares at the car under the morning sun.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
The door opens - Balram is surprised to see a smiling Mukesh.
BALRAM
Sir, namaste.

64.
MUKESH
Balram, come in.
Balram sees the Stork, a distraught Ashok and a LAWYER
sitting around the table.
BALRAM
Namaste, sir.
THE STORK
Ah my son, good to see. Sit, sit.
Balram touches the Stork’s feet and sits on the floor.
MUKESH
No, here on the sofa. Make yourself
comfortable.
BALRAM
No, sir, I can’t.
MUKESH
You’re part of the family now.
He sits on the sofa with pride and smiles.
MUKESH
Have you spoken with anyone about
what happened last night?
BALRAM
No, sir. I washed the car and went
to bed.
MUKESH
Good. It’s important that you not
say a word to anyone.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
- Would you like some paan?
BALRAM
No, sir. I quit paan, Ashok Sir,
tell them.
MUKESH
Don’t be shy. You chew paan.
(to the Lawyer)
Give him some.
(lawyer hands him paan)
Put it in your mouth.

65.

Ok, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
It’s good right?
BALRAM
Wow, it’s very good, sir.
LAWYER
The judge has been taken care of.
If your man does what he is
supposed to do, we’ll have nothing
to worry about.
MUKESH
My man will do what he is to do.
Right, Balram?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Mukesh hands the papers to Balram.
LAWYER
Can you read?
MUKESH
Of course he can.
LAWYER
Read it to us.
Balram watches an Ashok go to the window, his back to Balram.
BALRAM
To whomsoever it may concern, I
Balram Halwai do make the following
statement of my own free will: On
the night of November 3rd this
year, I drove the car that hit an
unidentified person, or persons or
objects...
BALRAM
I don’t understand, sir.
MUKESH
I’ll explain later. Keep reading.
BALRAM
... That I panicked and refused my
obligations to the injured party
and fled the scene.
(MORE)

66.
BALRAM (CONT'D)
That I was alone in the car and
alone responsible...
Balram reads silently. He looks at Ashok who averts his eyes.
MUKESH
We’ve already told your family.
Your granny, what’s her name? Hey,
Balram?
BALRAM
Kusum, sir.
MUKESH
Yes, Kusum ji. I drove down to
Laxmangarh and explained everything
to her. And your brother. Your
whole family was there. Your granny
is proud of you for doing this and
agreed to be a witness to your
confession. That’s her thumbprint.
Balram sees her thumbprint. Mukesh hands him a pen.
MUKESH
You need to sign just below that...
LAWYER
If he doesn’t know how to write, he
can press his thumb.
ASHOK
He knows how to write. Stop
treating him like he’s a moron.
MUKESH
Be quiet, Ashok. - Go ahead.
ASHOK
We shouldn’t do this. It’s wrong.
MUKESH
Then why don’t you and Pinky go to
the police station and tell them
what happened. If you understand
law, then handle this, otherwise,
shut up!
Balram watches Ashok who remains silent and averts his eyes.
MUKESH
Balram, go on, sign there, next to
granny. I’m here, don’t worry.

67.
Balram’s hands shake as he signs the confession. Mukesh takes
it from him and hands it to the lawyer. Balram is stunned.
MUKESH
Aren’t you my brother? Don’t we eat
and hang together?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
I’m here, Ashok brother is here,
father is here. There’s nothing to
worry about, right?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

MUKESH
Good. Now go outside and wait, we
will call you.
Yes, sir

BALRAM

He gets up and touches the Stork’s feet. He looks at Ashok as
he exits, but Ashok averts his eyes.
INT. ASHOK'S DELHI APART; HALLWAY
He exits and waits for the elevator.
INT. ASHOK'S DELHI APART; ELEVATOR
He rides down. His heart sinking...
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
Balram walks out. The sun blinds him.
He stares up at the towers of the masters looming over him.
He hides in some weeds, curling up, trying to save himself.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
Underneath the chandelier, Older Balram is in the lotus
position. He opens his eyes and LOOKS INTO THE CAMERA:

68.
BALRAM (TO CAMERA)
To think of this again makes me so
angry I might go out and cut the
throat of some rich man right now.
Hold on his face staring at us, implicating his audience.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT [PAST]
Balram sits in the mosquito net, legs curled up to his chest.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Not once did I think I had options,
not once did I think “I’ll tell the
judge the truth,” or run away.
INT./EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
Balram pushes through a crowd of POOR MEN to buy a bottle.
BALRAM
Whiskey, the cheapest kind!
Immediate service - or someone will
get hurt, I swear!
He opens the bottle, takes a big swig, and walks away. LATER He looks at WRETCHED HOMELESS living on the road-side.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I was trapped in the Rooster Coop.
And don’t believe for a second that
there’s a million-rupee game show
you can win to get out of it.
He squats in the dirt with some drunks.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The World’s greatest democracy.
BALRAM (V.O.)
For hundreds of millions of people
like me, there is only one way to
break free.
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ashok, sullen, smokes a joint. Balram watches.

69.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I would have to accept what this
man’s family would do - not just to
me - but to my family.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GARAGE - NIGHT
Balram sits in the dark garage.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And that takes no normal human
being, but a freak, a pervert of
nature. It would, in fact, take a
White Tiger.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - DAY
The servant’s phone is RINGING and RINGING. In his room,
Balram sits in the mosquito net.
VITILIGO-LIPS (O.S.)
Country-Mouse! Hey!
He enters and sees Balram in the net.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Your boss is ringing like crazy for
you. He was here the other night.
Balram buries his face in his pillow. Vitiligo comes closer.
VITILIGO-LIPS
You ill? Typhoid? Dengue? Malaria?
(smiles his white lips)
You seem to be in some big trouble?
Tell me... say something... Ah!
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; LIVING ROOM - DAY
Balram enters and sees the Stork and Mukesh watching cricket
on TV.
THE STORK
Sisterfucker, where were you? Go
get the oil and massage my legs,
you fucker.
Balram gets the oil, squats before the Stork, and begins to
rub oil over his leg.
Ashok and Pinky (she looks like a wreck) enter the apartment.

70.
THE STORK
You’re back. Sit down.
ASHOK
Who’s winning?
MUKESH
We are losing.
Pinky is focused on Balram and taps Ashok.
Balram...

PINKY MADAM

ASHOK
Balram. - Have they told you?
Sir?

BALRAM

ASHOK
You haven’t told him?
Mukesh shakes his head, “no.” Balram wonders what’s going on.
Pinky holds Ashok’s arm to stop him - she wants to do it. She
surprises everyone by sitting on the floor near Balram.
PINKY MADAM
They have a contact in the police,
no one reported seeing what... what
I did. They don’t need you anymore.
Balram is stunned with relief. He take a beat, then puts his
head to the Stork’s knee with gratitude. The Stork KICKS him
onto his back.
THE STORK
Enough drama you fucker. Massage my
legs.
PINKY MADAM
Why - why would you hit him? Why?!
ASHOK
Ok, calm down, it’s all right.
Let’s just go to the room and PINKY MADAM
Don’t tell me to calm down, it’s
like you don’t even care Suddenly, Pinky STRIKES the Stork. Ashok holds her back.

71.
PINKY MADAM
Why would you hit him? Why?
MUKESH
Stop it, you bitch. Ashok control
her.
ASHOK
Whoa, stop, come on, calm down,
stop doing this.
PINKY MADAM
Don’t tell me what to do. Get away
from me. Let go of me.
ASHOK
It’s over, it’s all good now.
PINKY MADAM
“It’s all good?” What’s wrong with
you? I’m done with all this.
She goes back to her room. Balram watches in shock.
MUKESH
Are you ok, father?
(off Stork’s silence)
I’m worried she wants to find the
family and compensate them. As if
we’re murderers.
ASHOK
She’s not going to do that.
MUKESH
You don’t talk right now. - She’s
been raving about it for days.
THE STORK
She can’t do that, Ashok. She’s
gone mad. Control her.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
LOUD SHRIEK of a train. CROWDS run, pile in. Mukesh helps the
Stork board; he then turns to Balram MUKESH
(taps his jacket pocket)
I have your confession here, and
will always have it here, brother.
He smiles at Balram, then enters the departing train.

72.
Balram walks away through the crowd of PASSENGERS rushing at
him, his mind a wreck.
EXT. OLD DELHI - MOMENTS LATER
Balram walks lost in thought. He sees poverty all around him.
LATER - he squats by the road. He sees a MAN passed out,
covered in flies.
He notices a MAN boiling tea for WORKERS. Balram is
transfixed by the bubbling milk over a HISSING blue flame.
He sees monkeys crawling across power cables overhead.
An OLD WOMAN shoves her hand into his face.
OLD WOMAN BEGGAR
Hey Brother, give me a rupee.
Move on.

BALRAM

OLD WOMAN BEGGAR
Give me something to eat, I haven’t
eaten in days.
BALRAM
Get moving.
OLD WOMAN BEGGAR
Where? Give me a rupee, give me He gets up and shouts at her.
BALRAM
Get away from me! What do you want
from me? Do you want me to rip my
clothes off and give it to you.
(opens his wallet)
Here, here is the 36 fucking rupees
I made this month, do you want that
to? Then what the hell will I eat?
OLD WOMAN BEGGAR
Give me a rupee.
BALRAM
This woman is insane. She’s crazy!
Get her off the streets. What the
fuck does she want?

73.
He wanders off into the crowd of people staring at him...
he’s becoming unhinged.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT
Balram lies asleep in the dark. The lights turn on.
Balram.

PINKY MADAM (O.S.)

Balram wakes up and sees Pinky.
PINKY MADAM
I need you to drive me.
Balram notices: her SUITCASE.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - NIGHT
Balram drives Pinky without Ashok; she stares at him in the
rear-view mirror.
PINKY MADAM
You were looking for the key for
years / But the door was always
open.
BALRAM
... Did you say something, madam?
He looks at Pinky, but she’s not looking at him at all; she’s
smoking a cigarette and staring silently out the window.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / AIRPORT - NIGHT
Balram pulls up and stops.
She gets out pushes a brown envelope through his window. He
takes it. They lock eyes. She leaves and enters the terminal.
He opens the brown envelope in hand: there is money inside.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - MORNING
Ashok argues with Balram:
ASHOK
Flight? What flight?

74.
BALRAM
I don’t really know what flight,
sir.
ASHOK
Why didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t
you wake me up.
BALRAM
I’m sorry sir, please! I just did
what she told me.
ASHOK
Why did you drive her there, behind
my back?
BALRAM
You can’t blame me, sir.
ASHOK
You’re my driver! You piece of
shit.
BALRAM
I’d never heard of a woman leaving
her husband Ashok SMACKS Balram in the face, like his father would.
ASHOK
Shut up! She has not left me.
BALRAM
Sir, don’t hit me.
He SMACKS Balram again in the face. He grabs him by the
collar and shakes him around.
ASHOK
She has not left me. You piece of
shit.
BALRAM
Sir, please release me, please sir.
It gets more intense until Balram shoves him off, sending
Ashok flying into the sofa.
BALRAM
Get off me!
They’re both surprised. Ashok stares up at Balram. A silent
beat between them.

75.
A crow suddenly lands on the balcony railing. They both turn
to see it. It CAWS, looks at them, then flies away.
ASHOK
I wish they had put you in jail.
Balram leaves.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - DAY
Balram anxiously waits.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I waited two days for my master to
call me.
EXT. ASHOK'S DELHI APARTMENT - SUNSET
He stares at the giant luxury towers.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT
Balram paces.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Had he gone back to America and not
told me?
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
Balram enters and sees Ashok smoking and drinking whiskey.
He’s a mess.
BALRAM
Sir... Sir, are you all right?
ASHOK
Why didn’t you pack up and leave
too?
BALRAM
It’s not good to starve yourself.
Let me make you dinner.
ASHOK
The whole thing was her fault,
bitch. (convulses) Ugh...
BALRAM
Should I call for pizza, sir.

76.
He gets up and rushes to the bathroom and throws up. Balram
follows.
BATHROOM - Balram enters and sees Ashok on the floor near the
toilet. He wets a towel and wipes Ashok’s mouth clean.
BALRAM
Feeling better sir?... You must
believe in God, sir. My granny says
if you believe in God, then good
things will happen.
ASHOK
... Why are you so kind to me?
BALRAM
It is my duty, sir.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON
KITCHEN - Balram squeezes lemon into a glass. He adds sugar,
salt, and fresh mint leaves with care.
He puts it on a tray and brings it to the living room.
BALRAM
Sir, I squeezed you a Nimbu pani.
It will make you feel better.
But Ashok is passed out. He TAPS him. Nothing.
BALRAM
Sir?... Sir. Wake up...
He SLAPS Ashok, but he doesn’t wake.
He SLAPS his master again, HARDER - Ashok is out cold.
He sits down and drinks the Nimbu pani himself. And looks at
Ashok passed out on the sofa. He puts his feet on the table.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Do we loathe our masters behind a
facade of love, or do we love them
behind a facade of loathing?
LATER - SLOW MO He puts Ashok’s arm around his shoulder and
helps him to the BEDROOM - SLOW MO They’ve never been this close. Balram lays
Ashok in bed, pulls the covers over him.

77.
ASHOK
... Where’s Pinky?
BALRAM
Shhh. You need to sleep, sir.
ASHOK
Balram... don’t leave.
BALRAM
I’m right here, sir.
Ashok gazes at Balram, then passes out. Balram looks at
Ashok’s skull on the pillow: like a religious icon.
LATER - DUSK: Balram looks through Ashok’s closet. He slips
on Ashok’s jacket and looks at himself in the mirror. He
changes his hair to a side part - like Ashok.
He cleans his ear with a Q-tip, then talks to it, imitating
Ashok:
BALRAM
“Why are you so kind to me, Balram”
He puts the dirty q-tip back in the glass with the others.
LIVING ROOM - NIGHT: Wearing Ashok’s jacket, Balram pours
himself Ashok’s top-line whiskey and enjoys.

With Pinky Madam gone...
EXT. MARKET - NIGHT
Balram and Ashok walk the CROWDED market laughing, talking.
BALRAM (V.O.)
... I knew it was my duty to be
like a wife to him. I didn’t let
him drink and I lifted his spirits.
INT. POOR MAN’S CAFE - NIGHT
The WAITER slams down plates of okra, cauliflower, daal.

78.
BALRAM
Once you have the food here, you’ll
never forget it.
Ashok takes a bite and loves it.
ASHOK
This is amazing. From now on, I
only want to eat your kind of food.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And I only want to eat your kind of
food.
ASHOK
You know the real India so much
better than me. My mom was the one
who encouraged me to go to America
to study... Pinky really loved
her.
Balram sees Ashok suddenly darken... and so he lies to him:
BALRAM
Sir, Pinky Madam told me you were a
great man who was going to do great
things in India.
ASHOK
When did she say that?
BALRAM
The morning she left. She was
crying the entire way to the
airport, sir. She said you would
not let Mukesh-sir tell you what to
do. She said she believes in you.
Ashok takes this in...
INT. ROADSIDE TEMPLE - SUNRISE
They enter the temple. Balram puts a rupee between statues
and prays. Ashok does the same. They pray.
BALRAM
She’ll come back to you, sir.
ASHOK
Yeah... she’s coming back. I can
feel it.

79.
BALRAM
I can feel it too, sir.
LATER - SLOW MOTION: A PRIEST puts a tika on their foreheads.
They stare at the religious icons of gods like Hanuman.
EXT. DELHI - VARIOUS
Images of the city.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON
Ashok and Balram stand side by side waiting. Mukesh side-hugs
Ashok, then shoves his luggage into Balram’s chest to carry.
MUKESH
Why is he here? - Go get the car.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
KITCHEN: Balram prepares lunch and spies on Ashok and Mukesh
in the LIVING ROOM.
ASHOK
... Divorce? She said that?
Balram sees Ashok’s face fall.
MUKESH
Don’t worry. I’ll handle
everything.
ASHOK
You’re probably happy she’s gone.
MUKESH
That’s not true. I just want your
happiness.
ASHOK
(gets his phone) I’m gonna book a
flight and go there and talk to herMukesh moves closer and puts his hand on Ashok’s knees.
MUKESH
Don’t call now. Breathe. Don’t go
begging. You’ll regret it.

80.
ASHOK
All I regret is letting her drive
that night.
MUKESH
That was not your fault.
ASHOK
It is my fault.
MUKESH
It’s not your fault and you know
it. I can stay here with you as
long as you like.
Balram sees Mukesh put his arm around Ashok.
MUKESH
You want that pizza you like?
Macaroni?
ASHOK
I’m sorry. Without you, I’d ...
Balram serves them lunch.
BALRAM
Here you are, sir.
ASHOK
I don’t want food right now.
BALRAM
I made it like we had together the
other night, sir.
Mukesh wonders what this is about.
ASHOK
I don’t give a shit.
BALRAM
Just a taste, sir.
Ashok slaps the food out of his hand, sending it crashing to
the floor, the bowl breaking apart.
ASHOK
I said I’m not hungry.... Get lost.
MUKESH
He doesn’t feel like it, why are
you up his ass! Ged rid of it, you
fucker.

81.
ASHOK
Just leave me alone for a fucking
second.
Balram walks away with the tray.
MUKESH
Until Ashok Sir calls you, don’t
hover over him like a fly!
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
Balram pinches his hand hard, again and again. - Why am I
still in servitude to this man?
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GARAGE - AFTERNOON
Balram walks under the tubes of light.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The desire to be a servant had been
bred into me, poured into my blood.
Hammered into my skull.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - MOMENTS LATER
Balram pulls the money out from under his bed and counts it.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Ninety-three 100 rupee notes. A
strange sum. Almost three months my
salary, but not quite. Maybe she
started with 10,000 and then
deducted 700. - No. No.
He paces and talks to himself, to the Buddha statue.
BALRAM
That’s not how rich people think.
Haven’t you learned yet, you idiot?
If she thought she owed you 10,000,
then what she truly owed you was
ten times more. -- No! A hundred
times more!
He stops pacing.

82.
BALRAM
They made me sign that confession and I asked for nothing in
return... I didn’t even think to
ask.
INT. GARAGE - LATER
Balram speaks with Vitiligo.
BALRAM
So what’s gonna happen to you when
you get older?
VITILIGO-LIPS
Eyes, it’s all the eyes. You work
‘till they work. When you’re fifty,
fifty-five they’ll kick you out.
BALRAM
And then what?
VITILIGO-LIPS
If you save, you’ll make enough to
buy a shack in a slum. If you’ve
been a bit smarter, and make extra
on the side, then maybe more.
That’s it?

BALRAM

VITILIGO-LIPS
This is the best case scenario. But
odds are your boss sacks you for no
reason, or you get into an
accident. Then you’ll be dead or
have nothing.
Balram grows sullen. Vitiligo pulls him away from the others.
VITILIGO-LIPS
Country-Mouse, are you ok?
BALRAM
Yeah, first class.
VITILIGO-LIPS
I’m sorry to tell you this, but the
other drivers are talking about you
openly... You sit in your master’s
car alone; you talk to yourself...
is it true?

83.
Balram wonders if it is...
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. ASHOK'S DELHI APART - NIGHT
Ashok smokes a joint and plays video games... while Balram
watches him from outside on the balcony.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I would not let him tell him, my
fate was a shack in a slum.
EXT. MECHANIC SHOP - DAY
Lots of auto-body shops around a mud circle. A MECHANIC hands
Balram an invoice, Balram hands him a small amount of money.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Over the next weeks, I learned the
ways driver’s cheat their masters.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
He hands an invoice to Ashok who gives him a wad of cash.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Number one, give your master phony
invoices for repairs that are not
necessary.
BALRAM
Thank you, sir.
EXT. GAS STATION / STREETS - NIGHT
Balram pumps gas into a gas can. LATER - he pours the petrol
into a taxi. The DRIVER pays him.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Two: sell your master’s petrol to
other drivers.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / DELHI STREETS - NIGHT
Location 1 Balram pulls over and picks up a CUSTOMER.

84.
BALRAM (V.O.)
As you gain confidence, cruise
around picking up and dropping off
paying customers. Delhi has many
pick-up points. Over time you will
learn them all.
Location 2 Customer puts money in Balram’s hand and he picks
up more people and drives off.
EXT. STREETS OF DELHI - NIGHT
Balram speeds through the streets.
BALRAM (V.O.)
When I looked at the cash, I didn’t
feel guilt. I felt rage.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / STREETS - NIGHT
Balram speeds and turns on the AC full blast. He’s drunk and
drinking whiskey. He turns up pop MUSIC and SINGS.
BALRAM (V.O.)
There are only two castes in India.
I was growing a belly at last.
He talks with an imaginary Ashok in the back seat - does
Balram really think he is there?
BALRAM
Ashok Sir, I’ll fuck your mother,
what about that? Hey are you
listening to me? I can’t drive like
this, take this.
He tries to hand “Ashok” the whiskey bottle.
BALRAM
Take it. You’re a eunuch, you
motherfucker! A eunuch!
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GARAGE; BALRAM’S ROOM - NIGHT
Balram pauses before he enters his room. Ashok is under his
mosquito net, drinking.
ASHOK
I know what you were doing.

85.
BALRAM
Please sir, don’t get upset with
me, I Ashok drinks whiskey from a bottle. He’s drunk.
ASHOK
You were at the temple offering
prayers for my health.
BALRAM
(!) Yes, sir. I’ve been worried
about you. I made an offering of
101 rupees in your name.
ASHOK
Come inside, sit down with me.
Balram sits inside the net facing Ashok, their knees touch.
ASHOK
Is this really where you live? It’s
so damp, and the smell.
BALRAM
Please sir, this place is like the
Taj Mahal for me.
ASHOK
No. No. Taj Mahal is a tomb Balram,
you don’t live in the Taj Mahal.
Ok, sir.

BALRAM

ASHOK
You know, I have never done what I
wanted to do with my life.
BALRAM
What did you want to do, sir?
ASHOK
Music. Or produce it, anyway. You
know I lived in the US for so many
years, I tried to be like them, but
I’m a fucking Indian at heart, you
know? We are fucking Indians.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

86.
ASHOK
I want to go to Bangalore and
change my country’s future. That’s
what I want to do.
BALRAM
Sir, you can do anything you want.
You’re a man of quality, sir.
ASHOK
(laughs)
A man of quality..
Yes, sir!

BALRAM

ASHOK
(sings)
You and I, we live in Paradise, but
we refuse to see it.
His singing is terrible.
BALRAM
Wow, sir. Wow! I didn’t know you
could sing. That’s beautiful.
ASHOK
Thank you, I try.
BALRAM
You know, I also sing.
Really?
Yes, sir.

ASHOK
BALRAM

ASHOK
Sing for me then!
BALRAM
Ok, maybe a little.
(sings)
Oh Morari, what can be said of you?
ASHOK
(sings)
Said of you!

87.
BALRAM
(sings)
In this world of yours I don’t want
to live!
ASHOK
(sings)
To live!
(speaks)
Wow, you’re good, we should form a
band Balram.
BALRAM
Ok, sir. Thank you, sir.
ASHOK
I wish I had a simple life like
you.
(touches Balram’s face)
My sweet Balram-ji.
Balram cringes.
INT. FIVE-STAR BANGALORE HOTEL - NIGHT [PRESENT]
Older Balram sits at the bar and stares at his whiskey. The
TV news gets his attention: WEN JIABAO has arrived in India.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I see you’ve arrived in my glorious
capital, sir. Maybe we can have a
drink together when you visit
Bangalore. You know, I would not be
able to afford even one Johnny
Walker Black with the money I had
cheated from my ex employer. Or get
a room in this five-star hotel with
the money Pinky Madam had given me.
Balram looks at a plump INDIAN ESCORT, she looks back.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Men born in the light, like my
master, have the choice to be good.
Men born in the coop, like me, we
don’t have that choice.
INT. MITSUBISHI / TRAFFIC JAM - NIGHT
Balram stuck in a traffic jam. Ashok and Mukesh, who has
returned with the RED BAG. Balram eyes them in the rear-view
mirror.

88.
NEWS HOST (ON RADIO)
The opposition party and underdog,
The Great Socialist, hopes to have
support from rural India.
MUKESH
Her party is a total mess. The
government is going to win for
sure. We just have to keep paying
them until the elections.
Balram eavesdrops while watching a BEGGAR WITH NO LEGS
approach the car:
ASHOK
I can’t keep doing this.
MUKESH
Things will change after the
election. Then you can do what you
want to do.
Balram unrolls the window and hands one rupee to the Beggar.
MUKESH
What was that? Who the hell told
you to do that? Can you believe
that?
ASHOK
Balram, why’d you give him money?
MUKESH
Turn the radio off, motherfucker.
Balram does.
MUKESH
Sister fucker, I told you not to
come this way.
ASHOK
I don’t know why he did that.
MUKESH
You think it’s your father’s money,
asshole?
ASHOK
Who do you think you are?
BALRAM
Sorry, sir. It won’t happen again.

89.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
At the bar, Balram prepares whiskey for Mukesh and Ashok who
eat food - the RED BAG on the coffee table between them. His
back is turned, but he spies on them through a mirror.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Be careful what you say around
drivers. We have grown skilled at
reading lips. I was certain I saw
the Mongoose say my name and then a
word no servant wants to hear:
“replacement.”
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - MORNING
Balram opens the car door for Ashok who walks towards him,
the RED BAG in hand.
ASHOK
To the Parliament House.
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

Just before Ashok sits, he pauses.
ASHOK
Ah, my phone. Just keep it in the
car.
He hands Balram the RED BAG and returns to the apartment.
Balram can’t believe, the bag is in his hands.
Balram looks around a beat - confirms that Ashok is gone,
that the LOBBY ATTENDANT is not watching.
He puts the RED BAG in the back seat, unzips it and sees:
STACKS OF 100 RUPEE NOTES. He rifles through, counting.
BALRAM (V.O.)
This was at least two year’s
salary, maybe three... I was worth
more.
He shoves the cash back in and zips it closed.
INT./EXT. [MOVING] MITSUBISHI / PARLIAMENT HOUSE - DAY
GUARDS eye Balram as he drives Ashok into a government
building. Ashok gets out with the RED BAG.

90.
Another Government Building - Balram spies on Ashok carrying
the RED BAG into another building.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Over the next days, I tried hard
not to look at the red bag.
INT./EXT. [MOVING] MITSUBISHI / DELHI STREETS - NIGHT
Balram’s POV: the RED BAG near Ashok, illuminated by his
phone. Delhi streets, MEN under lamps read newspapers, OTHERS
lie asleep in the street, headlights flash his eyes.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The city knew something was burning
inside of me, and she burned too.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / DELHI BANK - AFTERNOON
Balram’s POV: Ashok gets cash from an ATM and puts it in the
Red Bag.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / TRAFFIC - AFTERNOON
RED BAG in the rear-view mirror. An RICKSHAW DRIVER KNOCKS on
his window - it is his FATHER! Balram unrolls the window.
BALRAM’S FATHER
Even if you were to steal it, it
wouldn’t be stealing.
...

BALRAM

BALRAM’S FATHER
Mr. Ashok bribes politicians in
order not to pay taxes. So who is
he stealing from? The ordinary
people of this country - me and
you.
HONK. Balram HITS the brakes. His window is rolled up, and
the RICKSHAW DRIVER is no longer his father.
ASHOK
Hey. Balram, hey. Let’s go!
INT./EXT. [MOVING] MITSUBISHI / SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT
Ashok gets out with the RED BAG.

91.
ASHOK
I’ll be a couple of hours.
Balram drives away.
EXT./INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
Balram enters the station, lit up red at night.
At the skywalk, Balram notes destinations on two boards:
Benares, Jammu, Amritsar, Mumbai.
BALRAM (V.O.)
What would my destination be, if I
came here with the red bag?
FLAP FLAP FLAP. Balram sees pigeons fly between roof beams.
BARK BARK. A mangy dog growls at him, circling.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The pigeons, the dog, the station,
they could sense it: a rooster was
trying to escape from the coop!
He looks at the flying pigeons. All sounds die out except for
the FLAPPING of their wings... Balram is in terror.
BALRAM (V.O.)
What would Mr. Ashok do to my
family?
The FLAPPING continues over the NIGHTMARE IN BALRAM’S MIND:
EXT. TEMPLE ON HILL; LAXMANGARH - MORNING [BALRAM’S MIND]
FLAPPING continues as we see: a Thug beats Kishan to death
and dumps him next to his dead WIFE at a temple on a hill.
EXT. BALRAM’S FAMILY HOME; LAXMANGARH - MORNING [BALRAM’S
MIND]
A massacre: beaten, bloody and dead uncles, aunts and kids. A
THUG shots a feeling COUSIN dead. Another Thug stabs Granny
to death.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
The mangy BARKING dog pulls Balram out of his nightmare.

92.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - NIGHT
Balram drives and stares in the rear-view mirror at Ashok on
his phone, the RED BAG near him.
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT
They pull up. Balram opens the door for Ashok - but holds his
arm. Strange beat as the men stand at the car door.
BALRAM
Sir, there’s something I... I have
to tell you.
ASHOK
Yes... go ahead.
BALRAM
... Sir, I want to smash your skull
and steal your money.
Ashok considers this.
ASHOK
I know what you’re thinking. You
miss home, don’t you?
Yes, sir.

BALRAM

ASHOK
Plan a trip back. I’ll take care of
your expenses, don’t worry.
Ashok hands him a couple hundred rupees.
ASHOK
Good night.
Balram watches him enter the apartment. He looks at the money
and crumples it up.
BALRAM (V.O.)
He only gave me enough for a oneway ticket.
EXT. SLUM - DAY
Balram walks towards tents in a SLUM. He sees KIDS playing in
sewage. He sees a MAN crapping in daylight. The Man laughs
and encourages Balram to join him.

93.
Balram squats in front of the crapping man and smiles
strangely at him. The Crapping Man laughs and laughs. Balram
laughs too.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - DAY
Through the front windshield: SUPPORTERS of the Great
Socialist celebrate their victory, chanting, waving flags.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST (ON RADIO)
Upending all expectations, and
riding a wave of support from the
poor, the Great Socialist has won a
vast majority of the votes. There
is no water in our taps, and what
do the rich politicians in Delhi
give us: Cell phones!
ASHOK (INTO PHONE)
We went with the wrong side. - Turn
that off, asshole!
Balram turns off the radio and eavesdrops on Ashok.
ASHOK (INTO PHONE)
All the idiots from the villages
voted for her! What the fuck are we
going to do?
Protesters bang on their car. Ashok yells at Balram.
ASHOK
Sister-fucker, why the hell did you
come this way? Drive!
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT
Balram’s POV: Great Socialist, Man in White and Ashok exit
the hotel surrounded by her guards and staff. A CROWD chants
for them
CROWD
Long live socialism!
Balram opens the door for The Great Socialist to get in.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - NIGHT
Ashok sits in the back seat between The Great Socialist and
the Man in White. Balram drives and eavesdrops:

94.
ASHOK
Father sends his warm
congratulations. We’re all very
happy for your success.
THE GREAT SOCIALIST
Oh that’s very sweet of you.
ASHOK
We would like to show our
appreciation by making a 10 lac
donation to your party.
MAN IN WHITE
Is that how much you paid the
opposition party you fucker? 40
lacs, Monday night, the Sheraton
Hotel.
4 million rupees! Balram takes that in.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK
Balram finds a wrench. He feels its weight. The wind blows
garbage, a whirlwind of filth around him.
CRACK! He swings the wrench into a concrete block. Again CRACK - imagining what it would be like to do it.
INT. GARAGE OUTSIDE BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT
Balram enters, surprised to see a Dharam waiting.
DHARAM
I took the bus, the train and asked
people and found you. Granny said
you have to take care of me and
make me a driver too.
BALRAM
Who are you?
DHARAM
Dharam. I’m Luttu Auntie’s fourth
son.
Balram remembers. He sees a letter in Dharam’s hand.
BALRAM
What’s that?

95.

A letter.

DHARAM

BALRAM
A letter? Give it to me.
He takes the letter from Dharam and reads it.
GRANNY (V.O.)
Dear grandson. It has been seven
months and two days since you sent
us money.
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - DAY
Kishan and family surround Granny, who SPEAKS TO THE CAMERA:
GRANNY
The city has corrupted your soul.
Life has become hard here. Lord
Indra is not happy. You must send
us money again. Also, I have
arranged for your wedding. If you
do not come here, we will send the
girl to you by bus. If you refuse,
we will write a letter explaining
everything and send it to your
master.
She grins to the camera.
INT. GARAGE OUTSIDE BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - CONTINUOUS
Balram puts the letter in his pocket. He SLAPS Dharam hard.
BALRAM
Is she really going to marry me?
Yes Uncle.

DHARAM

BALRAM
Turn around, I am going to hit you
again. Turn around.
Dharam turns. Balram sees the boy’s lip is bleeding. He is
shocked by his own behavior.
He tosses the wrench aside and walks away. He crouches in the
corner, trembling. He’s breaking apart.

96.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - DAY
Ashok looks at Dharam standing next to Balram.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The next morning, Mr. Ashok did
something he had never done. He
gave me a day off.
ASHOK
Who is this? Your nephew?
BALRAM
Yes, sir. My family.
EXT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; LOBBY - DAY
Balram spies on a dark-skinned SERVANT walk into the lobby.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But by now I knew, the rich never
give anything for free.
Ashok greets him with a hand shake.
BALRAM (V.O.)
He had found my replacement.
EXT. NATIONAL ZOO - VARIOUS
Golden-beaked storks, hippos, and more stare at the camera.
Balram points out animals to Dharam, who is happy.
BALRAM (V.O.)
That’s when we saw the creature
that gets born only once every
generation.
They arrive at the last animal: THE WHITE TIGER.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The White Tiger.
Balram is transfixed as the tiger paces behind bars; black
stripes and sunlit white fur, dizzying to Balram.
IN BALRAM’S MIND: his father pulls a rickshaw.
The tiger focuses its eyes into Balram’s eyes.

97.
IN BALRAM’S MIND: funeral pyre: father’s foot curls up. //
Granny laughs at him // Pinky Madam smiles at him // Ashok
claps and smiles at him
Balram sweats, feels weak, his eyes flutter.
IN HIS MIND: Ashok slaps him in the face.
Balram faints. His face serene, like when he was a boy.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Iqbal, that great Muslim poet, was
right when he wrote: “The moment
you recognize what is beautiful in
this world, you stop being a
slave.”
EXT. LAXMANGARH VILLAGE - SUNSET
Young Balram stands on a cliff looking at the river.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; GARAGE NIGHT
Balram picks up a Johnnie Walker bottle and rotates it in his
hand, feeling its weight. He SMASHES the bottle against a
column.
CLOSER on the bottle - long, cruel, clawlike jags.
INT. ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT; BALRAM’S ROOM/GARAGE - VARIOUS
[RAIN]
MORNING - Balram lights incense sticks inside the car. He
wipes it clean, massaging the car for the last time.
Balram puts a plastic bag with clothes by the floorboard of
his seat. Next to it, he places the broken bottle.
Dharam watches Balram bow twice with folded palms to the car.
EVENING - Balram and Dharam eat together in silence. The boy
wonders what is happening.
NIGHT - Balram puts a few hundred rupees in Dharam’s pocket.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I hoped the next morning, when I
didn’t return, he’d know to run.
He gets in the car. Dharam watches him drive away.

98.
INT./EXT. MITSUBISHI / ASHOK’S DELHI APARTMENT - NIGHT [RAIN]
Balram pulls up. Mr. Ashok and the RED BAG get in the car.
BALRAM
To the Sheraton, sir?
ASHOK
(how did Balram know?)
... Yeah, the Sheraton.
Balram drives away.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - NIGHT [RAIN]
MUSIC. Rain hits the car. Balram drives. He looks at the RED
BAG next to Ashok.
ASHOK
Pinky called. She wants to know if
I’ll come back to New York.
BALRAM
Will you go back, sir?
ASHOK
And pretend to be someone I’m not?
(shakes head, “no”)
This is my country after all.
BALRAM
There is a story of a cunning
Brahmin, trying to trick Buddha.
The Brahmin asked, “Master, do you
consider yourself a man or a god.”
The Buddha smiled and said,
“Neither. I am just one who has
woken up while the rest of you are
still sleeping.”
Balram and Ashok stare at each other in the rear-view mirror.
EXT. SECLUDED DELHI STREET - NIGHT [RAIN]
Balram turns onto a secluded road.
INT. MOVING MITSUBISHI - CONTINUOUS [RAIN]
Balram sees Ashok’s face lit up by his phone. He looks out
the window: dark, empty streets. Balram stops the car.

99.
ASHOK
What’s wrong? Why’d we stop?
BALRAM
Something is off with the wheel,
sir. Just give me a minute, sir,
I’ll go check.
Ok.

ASHOK

Balram picks up the broken bottle and exits the car.
EXT. SECLUDED DELHI STREET - CONTINUOUS [RAIN]
Balram steps into the rain and soggy mud. He squats near the
left rear tire. He confirms that the road is dark, deserted.
He looks at bushes on the side of the road - a stretch of
wasteland beyond it. He places the broken bottle by the tire.
He looks in the car: the blue phone light illuminates Ashok’s
face. Balram taps the window. Ashok looks up.
BALRAM
There’s something off with the
wheel, sir.
ASHOK
Ok... maybe we should call for
help?
BALRAM
Who will come here, sir? If you can
just step outside we can fix it
together.
ASHOK
It’s raining, let’s just call for
help.
BALRAM
But sir, you’ll be late for your
meeting otherwise. If you can just
step outside, it won’t take much
time.
Ah... Ok.

ASHOK

Ashok puts his phone away; the car darkens. He gets out.

100.
BALRAM
Be careful of the bottle, sir. Let
me get it away.
Balram points to the BROKEN BOTTLE AND PICKS IT UP.
This tire?
Yes, sir.

ASHOK
BALRAM

Ashok gets on his knees.
Balram’s POV: Ashok’s skull. He wants to strike, but can’t.
The bottle feels heavy.
Ashok turns and looks up at Balram.
ASHOK
It seems fine.
BALRAM
No sir, you should have found a
replacement a long time ago.
BALRAM RAMS THE BOTTLE DOWN INTO ASHOK’S SKULL.
He thrusts it down three times. Ashok falls into the mud. A
HISSING sound from his lips.
Balram stands over him, watching Ashok crawl about in the
mud.
Balram steps forward, he puts his knee onto Ashok’s chest and
rubs his hand over Ashok’s clavicles and neck.
BALRAM CUTS ASHOK’S THROAT AND KILLS HIM.
He stands up and stares at Ashok’s dead body. He drops the
broken bottle and stares up into the rain before falling to
his knees... he has done it, he is free.
INT./EXT. MOVING MITSUBISHI / SECLUDED DELHI STREET - NIGHT
[RAIN]
Balram floors it. His eyes are wild as he speeds away. He
SHOUTS as loud as he can.
He sees the red bag on the seat next to him and laughs. But
then he is scared, realizing that he has actually done it. He
has killed his master.

101.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
The rain has stopped. Balram holds the RED BAG. He’s changed
clothes: a T-shirt, new pants, shoes.
Anxious, still no train. He sees pigeons FLAP between the
roof beams; a sleeping dog.
He sees a HOMELESS FAMILY AND KID. The Kid stares at Balram.
... Should he go back for Dharam? Balram curses himself and
leaves the station.
INT. BALRAM’S ROOM; DELHI - NIGHT
Balram sees Dharam awake under the mosquito net. Balram
reaches out his hand. Dharam takes it. They leave.
INT. MOVING TRAIN - MORNING
The train travels through the landscape. Balram hugs the Red
Bag and holds Dharam’s hand tightly.
Balram stares out the window, anxious, scared... the
future...
EXT. RURAL TRAIN STATION - MORNING
Balram and Dharam wait for the train in the middle of
nowhere. It arrives. They get in and leave.
INT./EXT. MOVING TRAIN IN LANDSCAPE - DUSK
The train travels under the vast sky. Balram stares out the
window, the RED BAG in hand, Dharam asleep on his shoulder.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT./INT. HOTEL IN BANGALORE - VARIOUS [PAST]
NIGHT - Dharam sleeps on the floor. Balram (with beard) lies
awake in bed, food has been left next to him - untouched.
DAY - Balram, in bed, wakes up. He sees Dharam watching him.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I am not a politician. They are
extraordinary men who can kill and
move on. Not me.
(MORE)

102.
BALRAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I didn’t leave this room for four
weeks until my nerves were calm.
EXT. BANGALORE STREET; BARBER - DAY
Dharam watches Balram get his hair/beard trimmed - a new man.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The last stage in my amazing
success story, sir, was to go from
social entrepreneur to business
entrepreneur. This was not easy.
EXT. BANGALORE; TECH CITIES; VARIOUS - VARIOUS
Bustling modern city of Bangalore. Impressive tech cities,
campuses that resemble Silicon Valley.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But I had an edge. I had come to
Bangalore INT./EXT. MOVING RICKSHAW / ELECTRONICS CITY - VARIOUS
DAY - Balram and Dharam sit in the Rickshaw and see the tech
buildings: Yahoo! Dell, GE, Siemens, HP, IBM.
BALRAM (V.O.)
- and Mr. Ashok had told me the
future: “Outsourcing!”
Balram and Dharam ride down an escalator.
NIGHT - Balram’s POV: a lot of SUVs drop off MEN & WOMEN.
Balram notices the DRIVERS getting out to open doors.
BALRAM (V.O.)
When I saw all those SUVs coming in
and out of the call centers to
America, I knew what my place would
be.
INT. BANGALORE POLICE STATION - DAY
A POLICEMAN escorts Balram (better dressed now) into the
police station.

103.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But how would I get rid of the
competition? Then I wondered, ‘what
would Mr. Ashok do?’
Balram says namaste to the ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER. Balram
hands him a leather bag.
BALRAM
Sir, I want to make a small
offering of my gratitude to you.
For what?

ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER

BALRAM
For all the good you are going to
do for me, sir.
As the Commissioner pokes in the bag...
BALRAM (V.O.)
Don’t worry, it wasn’t all of it.
But it was enough.
The Commissioner smiles.
Balram sees lot of WANTED POSTERS covering a wall and spots
HIS OWN FACE, a blurry photo on a WANTED FOR MURDER poster.
BALRAM (V.O.)
You know why they never found me?
Because my face could be the face
of half the men in India.
EXT. BANGALORE TAXI SERVICE - NIGHT
POLICE raid a taxi service, hassle DRIVERS, arrest the OWNER.
The Asst. Commissioner nods at Balram who is across the
street watching with Dharam. Balram smiles slyly.
BALRAM (V.O.)
The police arrested all the callcenter drivers for “expired”
licenses... Entrepreneurs create
opportunity. And that’s how I got
my own “start-up.”
EXT. WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT [PRESENT]
We travel past shining Toyota Qualises and lots of DRIVERS.

104.
BALRAM (V.O.)
White Tiger Drivers! I’ve got
thirty drivers who work in shifts
with twenty-six vehicles, all airconditioned for the summer months.
It’s three years later. Our pot-bellied, older Balram
oversees it all.
BALRAM (V.O.)
Put together with my bank holdings,
and I am worth fifteen times the
sum I borrowed from Mr. Ashok.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT
Balram’s laptop, open to his website: WHITE TIGER DRIVERS, We
Drive Technology Forward!
BALRAM (V.O.)
Your Excellency, please visit my
website. If you like what you see,
you can click where it says:
LAPTOP: CONTACT ASHOK SHARMA NOW.
Balram turns and looks into the camera.
BALRAM (TO CAMERA)
Yes, “Ashok.” That’s what I call
myself these days.
INT./EXT. WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT
A line of drivers, all from the darkness. Balram hands them
pay-checks while Dharam does the book-keeping.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But I don’t treat my drivers like
servants, I don’t care about their
religion and I certainly don’t call
them my “family.” They are my
employees. I make them sign a
contract and I sign it too.
EXT. SITE OF ACCIDENT - NIGHT
Balram gets out of his car at the scene of a hit-and-run.
TEENAGE BROTHER yells at a DRIVER. The DEAD BOY (12) lies in
the mud.

105.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And if there is a problem, I don’t
let my drivers take the blame.
POLICE welcome Balram, shake his hand.
POLICE AT SCENE
That’s the dead boy’s brother. Your
driver that hit him is there.
Balram looks at the corpse in the mud next to a mangled
bicycle. A beat, then he speaks loudly.
BALRAM
I am Ashok Sharma, I am the owner
of this vehicle. The blood is on my
hands, not my driver.
INT. BANGALORE POLICE STATION; OFFICE - NIGHT
Balram and the angry Teenage Brother wait. The ASSISTANT
COMMISSIONER enters with two POLICEMEN.
ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
It’s a terrible thing that has
happened. But it’s late....
BALRAM (V.O.)
I choose to do differently than my
masters, I live in the light now.
INT. DEAD BOY’S HOME - DAY
A photo of the Dead Boy with a jasmine garland around it.
Balram and Dharam sit opposite the Mother and FATHER.
BALRAM
I want to express my deep sorrow at
the death of your son.
He pulls out a BROWN ENVELOPE and sets it on the table.
BALRAM
There are forty thousand rupees in
here. I don’t give it to you
because I have to, but because I
want to.
(in Kannada)
Do you understand?
Balram sees the Teenage Brother watching from the hallway.

106.
BALRAM
I want to help your other son. He
can come and be a driver with me
and I will take care of him if you
want.
EXT. BANGALORE CAFE - SUNSET
Dharam (school uniform) does homework; Balram reads newspaper
headline: FAMILY OF 17 MURDERED IN NORTH INDIAN VILLAGE.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I’ll never know what happened to my
family. I could only wonder...
He folds the newspaper and puts it away.
BALRAM (V.O.)
But for the poor there are only two
ways to get to the top, crime or
politics. Is it like that in your
country too?
Balram notices Dharam staring at the newspaper headline.
BALRAM
Do you think about your mom and
dad?
DHARAM
... Give me another glass of milk,
won’t you, Uncle? And a bowl of icecream too.
BALRAM
Ice cream is for Sundays.
DHARAM
(hands him empty bowl)
No. It’s for today.
Smart boy.

BALRAM (V.O.)

EXT. BANGALORE LUXURY HOTEL - DAY
Balram, with his own POLICE ESCORT, gets to the front of a
SMALL CROWD as a DELEGATION arrives with POLICE ESCORT.
Balram sees a MAN emerge from one of the cars: WEN JIABAO.

107.
BALRAM
Your Excellency, it’s me, from our
emails, sir Ashok Sharma, The White
Tiger, how are you?
He shakes Wen Jiabao’s hand. PRESS take photos.
BALRAM
I wanted to tell you one more
thing, sir, we great entrepreneurs
always have our sights set on
tomorrow: real estate. With all
these American companies coming to
Bangalore, the white people will
need somewhere to sleep.
WEN JIABAO
Thank you, sir.
But Mr. Jiabao’s delegation whisks him away into the hotel.
BALRAM
Enjoy India, sir.
Balram watches him enter the hotel. Balram is flanked by his
police escort and speaks with them.
BALRAM
White people are on the way out.
They will be finished within our
lifetime. It’s the century of the
brown man and the yellow man, and
God save everyone else.
He puts his sunglasses on and walks away.
INT. BALRAM’S MOVING CAR; BANGALORE - NIGHT
Balram drives his BMW and looks out the window thinking.
BALRAM (V.O.)
I do think about my ex a lot, and I
do miss him. He didn’t deserve his
fate.... AH, I should have cut the
Mongoose’s neck.
INT. BALRAM’S OFFICE; WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT
Balram typing the email at his laptop, where we first found
him.

108.
BALRAM (V.O.)
And sometimes I think, even if they
catch me, I’ll never say I made a
mistake. It was all worthwhile to
know, just for a day, just for an
hour, just for a minute, what it
means not to be a servant.
INT./EXT. WHITE TIGER DRIVERS - NIGHT
Balram speaks directly to his Drivers as he gathers them and
brings them outside to the front of his business.
BALRAM
Now, what happens in your typical
Hindi film about murder? A poor man
kills a rich man and then gets
nightmares of the dead man pursuing
him screaming: “Murderer! Shame!”
It doesn’t happen like that. The
real nightmare is the other kind where you didn’t do it, that you
didn’t kill your master, that you
lost your nerve, and that you’re
still a servant to another man. But
then you wake up, the sweating
stops, your heartbeat slows. The
nightmare is over. You did do it.
You killed your master.
Balram steps away from them and speaks directly into the
camera:
BALRAM (TO CAMERA)
I have switched sides. I’ve made
it. I’ve broken out of the coop.
He exits frame, leaving a wall of drivers, servants, perhaps
new White Tigers, ready to strike, confronting the camera,
confronting the audience...

CUT TO BLACK
