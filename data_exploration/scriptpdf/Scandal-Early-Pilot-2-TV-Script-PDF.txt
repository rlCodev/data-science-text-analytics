INT. BAR - NIGHT

1

A Washington DC bar. Upscale. Young and intense in that
way that means everyone is holding a martini and scanning
the room for people more important than they are. It's not
drinks, it's a competition. And the winner is HARRISON (late
20s). At least, he ACTS like the winner. Right now, he's
at a table, drink in hand. QUINN (20s) comes in. Quinn
hates the fact that people assume that because she is pretty,
she is not smart. Because she is. Smart.
QUINN
Harrison Jones?
HARRISON
Quinn Reilly.
QUINN
I can't stay.
HARRISON
What are you drinking?
QUINN
I can't stay. I'm sorry. I only
came because Lori wouldn't give me
your number so I could cancel and I
didn't want you to be waiting here
because getting stood up in this
particular bar is like falling face
down on a runway and even though I
don't know you, Lori's got this
annoying habit of meddling, so it
seemed only decent toHARRISON
What are you drinking?
QUINN
I can't stay, is what I am saying.
I don't do blind dates.
HARRISON
My parents met on a blind date.
Been inseparable ever since.

Ask me who I work for.
QUINN

What?

HARRISON
You really wanna ask me who I work
for.
Fine.

QUINN
Who do you work for?

HARRISON
Olivia Price.
Quinn sits back down.

Stunned.

QUINN
Olivia Price? THE Olivia Price?
(glee to insanity to
despair)
Wait. Shut up. Wait.
(don't fuck with me)
Is this some kind of ploy to make me
stay on this date?
Harrison reels in his fish.
HARRISON
Quinn, this is not a blind date. On
blind dates, I like to buy a woman
dinner because it makes her more
likely to either sleep with me or
give me a second date. When I buy
you dinner, you'll know I'm
interested. You did apply for a job
with me. The way I know you applied
for a job with me is that I have
your resume on my iPad. The way I
know you would kill puppies to get
this job is that you stopped breathing
when I said the name Olivia Price.

HARRISON (CONT'D)
Which is a tell, your tell, and you
should look at that because I'm going
to offer you a crap salary and you'll
have to take it because you never
learned to breathe in and out without
stopping. But don't feel bad about
it because we all get paid crap
salaries because we're the good guys.
I'm a good guy which means I don't
generally lie but I did to you.
This is not a job interview.
Wait.

QUINN
I don't...I'm confused.

HARRISON
Olivia already told me to hire you.
The job is yours. If you want it.
It's the best job you'll ever have.
You will change lives, you will slay
dragons, you will love the hunt more
than you ever dreamed. Because Olivia
Price is as amazing as they say.
And I am not a baby lawyer, I am a
gladiator in a suit. Because that's
what you are when you work for Olivia.
A gladiator in a suit. You wanna be
a gladiator in a suit?
His enthusiasm is mesmerizing.

And true.

Quinn nods.

HARRISON (CONT'D)
You gotta say it.
And Quinn takes a deep breath...
QUINN
I wanna be a gladiator in a suit.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

It's dirty and abandoned down here. An SUV pulls up and
OLIVIA (30s) steps out. Stylish but weary, too smart for
her own good. People tend to underestimate her. That's a
mistake. STEPHEN (30s) is waiting for her. STEPHEN's
handsome and male and brilliant in a way that makes you
worried you'll do something inappropriate like lick him.
The minute she's out of the car, they head for the warehouse.
All business, intense.

The elevator rises.
OLIVIA
Hey, did you propose? Weren't you
going to ask her marry you tonight?
STEPHEN
I was doing this tonight.

Say it.

OLIVIA
So you bailed. -- Did you give them
the money?
STEPHEN
Yes. Which is when the problem
started. -- And I did not bail.
I'm working. For you. Now say it
because I don't wanna take crap for
it laterOLIVIA
This is not on you. -- Did you at
least buy the engagement ring?
STEPHEN
Olivia. What's going on in that
warehouse? Is not good. Is, in
fact, the opposite of good. So
bugging me about proposing to my
girlfriend? Not on point. There's
a situation in there. Focus. Do
what you do.
A beat.
OLIVIA
You really should have proposed...
And the elevator opens onto...

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Where two men in expensive suits stand. They look like
businessmen. Or stockbrokers. Except for the fact that
they are currently holding guns on one another. Let's call
them OSKAR (40s) and VLAD (50s). They're Russian, nervous;
there's a basket and an ENORMOUS pile of money wrapped in
neat stacks on the table. Even so, Olivia is calm, confident.
OLIVIA
Is there some way I can expedite the
proceedings, gentlemen?
OSKAR
I'm gonna kill him! I swear to God,
I'll blow his brains on the carpet!
VLAD
Not if I shoot you first!
OLIVIA
No one is shooting anyone.

He puts down his, I'll put down mine.

OSKAR
So he can shoot me?

Hell no.

Olivia looks to Stephen. Sighs. Then she steps between the
two men. So that both guns are now pointed directly at her.

Okay? Now the only person who gets
shot is me.

Vlad?

VLAD
I wanted us to go 50/50. He wants
70/30. I did all the work!
OLIVIA
Oskar, will you consider 60/40 if
Vlad promises not to blow you?
Oskar thinks.

Then:

OSKAR
I keep the car.
OLIVIA
What car? You know what, forget I
asked. I don't need to know. Vlad,
can Oskar keep the car?
VLAD
I suppose that's okay.

Yes.

OLIVIA
So no one blows anyone, we have a
60/40 split and Oskar keeps the car.
Any other deal points either of you
would like to negotiate at this time?
No.

VLAD/OSKAR
/I'm good.

Guns down.

OLIVIA
GUNS DOWN.

Reluctantly, Vlad and Oskar lower their guns.

Now shake hands.
They look at her.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Good boys. Now I'm gonna take what
we paid for and I'm going to go. I
do not want to hear any gunfire when
I leave this building, is that clear?
They nod.

Olivia steps forward, gently picks up the basket.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
It was a pleasure doing business
with you. I thank you. My client
thanks you. I hope to never see you
again.

And she and Stephen back out the door with the basket.

He passes HUCK, high fives him as he moves by.

HARRISON
She's always here.

They round a corner and inside the glass walls of the
conference room, Olivia, Stephen and ABBY (30s) are visible.
They're eating Chinese food, Olivia's sitting on the table,
shoes kicked off, the basket beside her. ABBY is warm and
bubbly, the kind of woman who has cats and knits things.
But don't get too comfortable -- she'll stab you with her
knitting needle if you fuck with her.
HARRISON (CONT'D)
That's Stephen and that's Abby.
He's a litigator, she's an
investigator. And that's...

She's looking at Quinn.
QUINN
I'm sorry...um...ma'am...I didn't

say, I'm a huge fan, I so admire
your work in the White House, it's
an honor to work for your law firm.
She's nervous, gushing.
OLIVIA
We're not a law firm. We're lawyers
but this is not a law firm.
STEPHEN
Law firms are for pansies.
OLIVIA
We...solve problems.

Manage crises.

ABBY
Save reputations.
Of course.

QUINN
Right.

Still...an honor.

a gladiator in a suit?

Quinn stares at the baby, stunned. Then the elevator dings
and three white men in suits rush in followed by the POLISH
AMBASSADOR and his WIFE. When she sees the baby...
BAZYLI!

WIFE

She's crying, moving forward, pulling the baby from Olivia's
hands into her arms. The Ambassador turns to Olivia.
AMBASSADOR
Thank you, thank you. When the
Russians kidnapped him, I
thought...but you've returned my son
to me. Thank you.
And he pulls her in for a hug. One of the men in suits
discreetly hands Stephen a check. He checks the amount,
smiles. The ambassador is still hugging Olivia.
AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
Anything I can do for you. Anything.
STEPHEN
If you have a second child, Olivia
is a beautiful name.
OLIVIA
Stephen. -- Mr. Ambassador, you can
take your son back to your consulate
and keep him safe. And you can never
tell anyone about this. Ever. The
FBI is sick of me.
Of course.
And they go.

Olivia and the others enter. There's a MAN (32) there.
Handsome and charismatic in a John Edwards way. He has a
noticeable limp -- a war injury that only makes him seem
more heroic. Right now, though, his shirt and part of his
face are covered in blood. He eyes them panicked and lost.
MAN
I...I didn't know where else to go.
I had a friend...he recommended you.
OLIVIA
You're Sully Sinclair.
He nods. Immediately Stephen, Harrison and Abby whip out
their iPhones. Start searching. Speak low to one another.
War hero?

STEPHEN

ABBY
Iraqi Attacker.
Sully's frantic.
SULLY
You gotta help me. Somebody has to
help me. Please...

Harrison very calmly uses his phone to take a photo of Sully.
Then he leans over to Quinn.

INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Through the glass we can see Sully sitting in the conference
room. Someone's given him a towel and he uses it to wipe
the blood from his face. Outside the glass, Harrison,
Stephen, Quinn and Olivia watch him. Abby arrives, hands
out a sheath of papers.
ABBY
Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan "Sully"
Sinclair, age 32, did two tours in
Iraq, was injured saving the lives
of his entire unit. A war hero.
STEPHEN
And not just any war hero. The first
living person ever to receive a
Congressional Medal of Honor from
the President for action in any war
since Vietnam.
ABBY
A famous war hero. Working class,
patriotic, comes from a long line of
soldiers. Here he is on the cover
of Time magazine.
She passes the page forward.

Olivia looks at it.

OLIVIA
Poster boy for the military.
ABBY
And for the conservative right.
That's how he makes his living. He
gives expensive speeches. Makes a
fortune. He's anti-choice, pro-gun,
hates the gays and likes it when
kids pray in school.

ABBY
I'm just saying he sickens me

Do you actually have the naive belief
that waking me up in the middle of

I can have a reporter out here in 20

you are persecuting an innocent,

Harrison and Quinn begin to pin pieces of paper to the walls.
Photos of Paige and Sully. Harrison pins two typed up pages.
QUINN
What are those?
HARRISON
Two statements. One if he's arrested.
One if we get him out of this.
They work a beat.
QUINN
So you guys don't have secretaries
or assistants or anything? It's

HARRISON
Secretaries and assistants have

QUINN
So I read you guys don't try cases?
You don't go to court?
HARRISON
If we do our job right, we never
need to go to court. Look, the reason
we're not a law firm? We don't have
to play within the rules of the law.
We're fixers, crisis managers. We

Olivia holds up a finger, telling him to wait.
OLIVIA
Kevin, I'm not saying don't write
your article. I'm saying he's a
decorated war hero who loved his
girlfriend and maybe you can wait to
say he did it until you have all the
facts. I'm saying the autopsy report
doesn't tell us anything except that
she was shot three times so it would
be overzealous to describe this as a
crime of passion. I'm not gonna
tell you how to do your job, you're
brilliant, I'm just saying. -- I'll

SULLY

country. I am honored to have been
injured serving my country. And

INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES/STEPHEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
ON THE TV: We're still watching Sully's press conference.
SULLY
I am honored to be a gay man who
served my country.
It's a moment. A victory. Flashbulbs go off. Questions
are shouted. The press goes crazy. We pull back to find:
Abby and Stephen. Watching. Proud.
ABBY
The other soldiers are a nice touch,

STEPHEN

Harrison, Huck and Quinn are taking down the photos and papers
on the wall and putting them in a box. They're almost done.
QUINN
What do you do with all this stuff?
File it?
HUCK

Huck picks up the box, heads out.
Checking her out.

Harrison looks at Quinn.

HARRISON
Can I buy you dinner?
No.

INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES/OLIVIA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office is dark, bathed only in the light of the TV
screens. Olivia stands, looking at a frozen image of Sully
on each TV.
CYRUS (O.S.)
Nice work on Sully Sinclair.
Olivia looks up. Sees Cyrus moving into her office.
Secret Service agent's just outside the doorway.

His

CYRUS (CONT'D)
He wants to see you.
OLIVIA
Tell him to go to hell.
CYRUS

And he starts to move away.

But Olivia stops him with:

separate TV images becomes ONE GIANT IMAGE of the screen as
she hits play:
SULLY

More importantly, I am honored to be
a gay man who served my country.
And as the flashbulbs go off, we see the light from flashes
playing on Olivia's face as she stares at the screen. Alone.
Strong. A gladiator in a suit.
And then she presses the OFF button on the remote and
everything goes BLACK.
FADE OUT:
END OF SHOW
