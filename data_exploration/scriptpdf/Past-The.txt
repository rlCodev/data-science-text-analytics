Shooting script – september 2013

1. INT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT – DAY
Behind the glass wall, which separates the baggage claim area from the
busy airport terminal, MARIE is awaiting the arrival of a passenger.
She is holding a simple bouquet of flowers. She scans the crowd of the
newly arrived passengers. Marie’s gaze reveals a sense of worry. Her
eyes fix on a man who has his back towards her. She looks more
carefully, uncertain that he is the man she is waiting for. The man is
waiting along with the other passengers for his suitcase. Marie changes
position so that perhaps she’ll be able to see his face. She briefly
sees his profile. He’s AHMAD, forty-four years old. She spontaneously
raises her hand to catch his attention but changes her mind. She takes
off her wristbrace and stuffs it into her purse. She prefers to watch
him for a few moments from afar. Marie is intensely watching Ahmad; he
has not yet seen her. One by one, the passengers take their suitcases
and leave. Only Ahmad is still waiting next to the empty carousel for
his suitcase. Ahmad wanders through the baggage claim area looking for
a representative to report his missing suitcase. He speaks to a member
of the airport staff. Marie tries to get his attention from afar by
waving her hand. She signals to a passenger who is holding a suitcase
and walking by Ahmad to get him to look at her. The passenger speaks to
Ahmad. He now turns his head and sees Marie through the glass wall.
Happy, he walks towards her. They both come face-to-face on either side
of the glass wall. They cannot hear each other. From the expression on
their faces, it is clear that they have not seen each other in a long
time. She understands that his luggage has not arrived with the flight.
2. EXT. OUTSIDE CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT – PARKING LOT – DAY
It’s pouring rain. Marie and Ahmad run side by side through the parking
lot. They are laughing complicitily. They jump into the car, both
soaking wet.
3. EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT – PARKING LOT – INT. SAMIR’S CAR –
DAY
Marie opens the door and sits behind the wheel. The water is dripping
down her face. Ahmad also gets in, struggling to catch his breath.
MARIE
You still smoke?
AHMAD
No, I’m getting old.
Marie reaches over to take a box of tissues. She dries her face, then
offers one to Ahmad, who does the same. Marie tosses her bag in the
back. Ahmad does the same with his backpack and the bouquet. He notices
the back of the car is loaded with all sorts of things. Several clothes
covered in plastic dry-cleaning bags are hanging from the ceiling of
the car.
AHMAD
(jokingly)
You bought a car?
MARIE

(laughing)
No, I borrowed it.
Marie starts the car. Ahmad is surprised by the music that comes on.
She turns the radio off and attempts to dry her hair with the car’s
heater which is still warming up. Then, she struggles to put the car in
gear. Her wrist hurts, so, she tries with her left hand.
AHMAD
What’s wrong?
MARIE
My wrist hurts.
Ahmad shifts the gear for her.
AHMAD
(jokingly)
You’re getting old too.
MARIE
(lsmiing)
Look out your side and see if I have
enough room.
Ahmad looks out the passenger-side window and Marie starts to back up.
AHMAD
You have room…
The car hits something.
AHMAD
Stop! What are you doing?
FADE IN:

TITLE:
THE PAST

4. EXT. HIGHWAY – INT. SAMIR’S CAR – DAY
The rain has eased up. Ahmad and Marie drive through a tunnel and
continue on a highway leading to the city.
AHMAD
Do the girls know I’m here?
MARIE
No.
AHMAD
Didn’t you tell them?!
MARIE
I thought you might let us down at the
last minute, like the last time.

Ahmad falls silent. Marie looks at him and smiles. As if she’s trying
to soften her harsh comment.
MARIE
Put it in fourth.
Ahmad shifts the gear for Marie.
AHMAD
I’m here now, let them know. I’d like
to see them.
MARIE
We’re going to see them now.
AHMAD
Where?
MARIE
We’re picking up Lucie and going home.
AHMAD
Didn’t you book a hotel for me?
MARIE
No.
AHMAD
You were supposed to.
MARIE
I wasn’t sure you’d come.
AHMAD
What do you mean you weren’t sure?
MARIE
I wasn’t sure.
AHMAD
Listen, something came up last time.
Just two days before I...
MARIE
Don’t worry about it. Don’t start
making excuses, we don’t have all day!
AHMAD
Just because I cancelled my trip once?
MARIE
Not just for that.
They both fall quiet and go on driving for a while in silence.
MARIE
The girls would like to have you.
AHMAD

I don’t want to disturb.
MARIE
You won’t disturb us. You’ll have to
come for your suitcase anyway, when
it’s delivered.
Ahmad doesn’t reply.
MARIE
At least, come and change your clothes
so you don’t catch a cold.
Ahmad still doesn’t reply and wipes the steamed-up windshield.
5. INT. SAMIR’S CAR – EXT. THE STREET OF LUCIE’S SCHOOL – DAY
Students exit a school. Ahmad sits alone in the car, watching the
students file out through the window. A police officer knocks on the
window. Ahmad gets out of the car and goes towards her to dissuade her
from writing the ticket. She tells him to move the car. Ahmad sits in
the driver’s seat.
6. INT. SAMIR’S CAR – EXT. THE STREETS AROUND LUCIE’S SCHOOL – DAY
Ahmad is behind the wheel and can’t find a place to stop. He is forced
to go down a one-way a street and turn onto another street to circle
back to the school. The sun shines into his eyes. As he lowers the sun
visor, a few pieces of paper fall out. He tries to pick them up as he
is driving. Among the documents, he sees an identification photo of a
man in his early thirties. He stares at the picture and drives for a
moment while holding it in his hand. He tucks the papers back in their
place. He turns onto the street where the school is located. The crowds
of students have thinned out. He sees Marie standing by the side of the
road looking worriedly for her car ans Ahmad. She sees him and gets in.
AHMAD
She was going to give you a ticket… I
went around the block.
Marie does not respond. She seems upset.
AHMAD
So?
MARIE
She’s left.
AHMAD
Did she know you were coming to pick
her up?
She asks him to get going and takes out a cigarette and lights it. She
rolls down the window to let the smoke out. Ahmad realizes she’s upset.
AHMAD
Maybe she went home because you were
late?
MARIE

It’s not her first time.
AHMAD
Why?
MARIE
I don’t know. Last night she came home
at 11.
AHMAD
They all go through this at her age,
it’s normal.
MARIE
It’s not normal.
AHMAD
Why what’s wrong with her?
MARIE
She’s been givng me hell for two
months over nothing. Maybe you could
talk to her, try and see what’s wrong
with her?
AHMAD
If she still remembers me after all
this time.
MARIE
She loves you.
AHMAD
After all this time?
MARIE
Where are you going? Turn right!
Ahmad, who has forgotten the way, follows Marie’s directions.
AHMAD
I was daydreaming.
MARIE
You’ve forgotten everything.
AHMAD
I was distracted.
7. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARIE’S HOUSE – DAY
A long, wide street cuts through a residental neighborhood of similar
stand alone houses near a railline. Ahmad pulls over in front of the
house. Marie gets out of the car to go inside.
AHMAD
Marie-Anne…
Marie pauses and turns to Ahmad. Ahmad takes the papers and documents
from above the sun visor and holds them out to Marie.

AHMAD
You shouldn’t leave this here. It’s
risky.
Marie takes the documents and puts them in her purse. She senses that
Ahmad has already seen the picture. Ahmad also gets out.
8. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – THE FRONT YARD – DAY
The front yard of Marie’s two-story house is separated from the street
by a metal fence and a gate. Ahmad looks at the yard from between the
gaps in the fence. A ten-year-old girl, LEA and a six-year-old boy,
FOUAD are busy playing in the yard. Lea and Fouad are struggling to put
into place the chain of an old bicycle, probably belonging to Lea.
Marie who has entered the yard, starts picking up the hanging laundry.
MARIE
Is Lucie home?
LEA
No.
She goes in the house. Ahmad discreetly enters the yard.
LEA
You broke it.
FOUAD
Pull harder...
LEA
I can’t. I’ll hurt my hand.
AHMAD
(to Fouad and Lea)
No, not like that. First put one side
on, then the other.
The two children have only now noticed Ahmad’s presence. Surprised,
they stop pulling on the chain. Ahmad takes the chain from them.
AHMAD
I’ll show you. This goes there...It’s
dried out.
(to LEA)
We need some oil. You know where to
find some? It used to be in the
cupboard in the shed.
LEA
Ahmad!
Ahmad is happy that Lea has recognized him so quickly. He holds her
tightly in his arms. Surprised and curious, Fouad looks at them.
AHMAD
My dear Lea... You’re doing good?
You’ve grown so much, sweetie.

Ahmad holds out his hand to Fouad.
AHMAD
Hello, Sir.
Fouad does not shake his hand.
AHMAD
(jokingly to Lea)
Your friend is ignoring me. What’s
his name?
FOUAD
His name is Fouad.
AHMAD
Hello, Fouad.
Fouad shakes his hand.
9. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – DAY
Marie’s house is two-stories. On the first level is the kitchen with a
window facing the backyard, Marie’s room, the study with the computer
and the children’s room. On the second floor, which is reached via a
narrow stairway, there is only one bedroom with a window, which faces
the front yard and street. Although the house is old, it is clear that
it has been recently renovated. The paint on the walls has not yet
fully dried and a ladder and painting supplies can be seen throughout
the house. Marie climbs the stairs to the small upstairs room she has
prepared for Ahmad. In the bedroom is a small wooden bunk bed,
presumably belonging to her daughters. She lays the clothing she has
brought for Ahmad on the bed. While she is making the lower bed, shes
watches through the window Ahmad who is busy fixing the bike with
Fouad. She opens the window facing the yard.
MARIE
Come inside, Ahmad. And you, Fouad,
come get your things in the bedroom.
10. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – DOWNSTAIRS – DAY
Marie goes to the bedroom to dry her hair. Ahmad and Fouad come inside.
Lea comes out of the kitchen.
LEA
It wasn’t in the shed.
AHMAD
Then you changed its place while I was
away.
FOUAD
There’s some in my father’s car.
Ahmad heard what Fouad said but does not react. He notices the freshly
painted walls. As he wanders through the house, it is clear that he has
memories of this place. Lea and Fouad are standing watching him.

AHMAD
(to Lea)
Where’s the shelf that was here? The
old wooden shelf...
LEA
We moved it.
AHMAD
There were books of mine on it.
MARIE
All your stuff’s put away in the shed.
Marie, facing the mirror in her bedroom is trying, despite her aching
wrist, to blowdry her hair. Ahmad peeks into the bedroom, leaning
against the doorframe.
MARIE
Watch the paint.
Ahmad straightens up.
AHMAD
Wasn’t the other color better?
MARIE
It’s not done yet. My wrist made me
stop.
Ahmad enters the room.
AHMAD
(jokingly)
You should’ve waited for me to come. I
I could’ve done it while I’m here. It
would’ve kept me busy.
He takes the blowdryer from Marie to help her. Standing close to her,
he dries her hair while she brushes it with her other hand.
AHMAD
I’ll do it.
MARIE
Didn’t you want to go to a hotel?
Ouch! You’re burning me.
Ahmad holds the blowdryer further back and falls silent. Marie
continues brushing her hair.
MARIE
It’s fine, thanks.
Ahmad turns off the blowdryer. Marie gets up. She picks up the phone
and walks out of the room while dialing.
MARIE

I left some clothes upstairs. Go
change before you catch a cold.
Ahmad remains in the room. As the phone rings, Marie walks towards
Lea’s room. She sees Fouad, standing in the hallway, keeping an eye on
the bedroom.
MARIE
(to Fouad)
What are you doing here? Go on. Get
your things and go upstairs. You’ll
sleep there and Lucie here.
FOUAD
I don’t like it upstairs.
Ahmad comes out of the bedroom and walks towards the stairs.
MARIE
It’s just while Ahmad’s here, then
you’ll come back downstairs. Hurry up,
please.
(on the phone)
Lucie, call me back, please. I have a
surprise for you.
Marie hangs up. Fouad is upset as he grabs his things and pulls his
sheets off the bed.
11. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM – DAY
Ahmad is looking out the window. Everything brings back old memories.
Fouad pushes the door open with his body and walks in holding all of
his bedding. Exasperated, Fouad dumps his things on the bottom bunk and
climbs up to make the bed on the top. Ahmad is staring at Fouad as he
struggles to make his bed. Ahmad helps him, scrutinizing his
expression.
AHMAD
Is that your father’s car outside?
FOUAD
Yes.
AHMAD
Do you live here?
FOUAD
Yes.
AHMAD
With your father?
FOUAD
Yes.
AHMAD
Since when?

FOUAD
Since school started.
Ahmad is taken aback by Fouad’s answer. He sits on the edge of the
lower bed. Fouad is still struggling with the sheet.
AHMAD
Don’t bother making your bed. You can
sleep downstairs in your own bed.
Fouad takes the sheet and climbs down the ladder of the bed. He again
gathers his things to leave the room.
12. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – DOWNSTAIRS – DAY
Fouad comes down the stairs. Marie is getting ready and sees Fouad and
comes towards him.
MARIE
Why are you coming down?
FOUAD
He told me to.
Surprised, Marie walks upstairs.
13. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS BEDROOM – DAY
Marie opens the door. Ahmad is sitting on the edge of the bed. Marie
realizes how upset he is. She enters the room and closes the door.
MARIE
There aren’t enough beds for the three
of them downstairs.
AHMAD
You live with someone?
MARIE
Yes.
AHMAD
You didn’t tell me.
MARIE
(surprised)
What do you mean? I wrote it in my
email.
AHMAD
What email?
MARIE
I don’t know which one. One of them.
AHMAD
I didn’t get any.
MARIE

So, why did you want to stay at a
hotel?
AHMAD
I didn’t want to disturb you.
MARIE
In any case, I wrote you.
AHMAD
I didn’t get anything.
MARIE
You didn’t wonder why I asked you to
come for the divorce?
Ahmad is quiet. Marie leans against the wall. Their eyes meet. After a
long silence, Ahmad finally speaks.
AHMAD
Does he know I’m here?
MARIE
Yes.
AHMAD
I’m leaving then.
MARIE
He won’t come by while you’re here. Or
he’ll let me know, for sure.
AHMAD
When did you send that email?
MARIE
I don’t know.
AHMAD
It must still be in your inbox.
MARIE
I guess so. Do you want me to show it
to you?
AHMAD
I asked you to book a hotel for me.
MARIE
I did last time and you didn’t come. I
had to cancel.
AHMAD
How much did it cost you?
Marie is hurt. She moves towards the door.
AHMAD
What time do I have to be in court
tomorrow?

MARIE
You said you’d stay to talk to Lucie…
AHMAD
When will she be home?
Marie shrugs.
AHMAD
I can meet up with her tomorrow.
Marie opens the door.
MARIE
I was hoping you’d keep your promise
for once.
Marie leaves the bedroom. Ahmad is upset and remains seated on the edge
of the bed. Marie hears his answer as she goes down the stairway.
AHMAD
I didn’t promise anything.
MARIE
My mistake. Sorry.
14. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY – DAY
Marie comes down the stairs. A can of paint has spilt on to the floor.
The footstool, which Lea had brought from the shed, is next to the
spilt paint. Marie is furious, she sees paint covered footprints
leading towards the garden where the children are playing. Marie storms
into the yard.
15. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – YARD – DAY
Marie comes to the yard. She sees Fouad’s shoes, which are covered in
paint. He is putting dishwashing liquid on the dry bicycle chain. She
lunges towards him.
MARIE
(angry)
Fouad! Can’t you watch where you walk?
Fouad is looking at the bicycle chain and does not look up.
MARIE
Why do I spend hours cleaning? For you
to make a mess? Look at me!
LEA
(pointing to the
dishwashing liquid)
We went for this.
MARIE
(to Fouad)
I don’t give a damn!

Fouad lifts his head and looks Marie in the eyes. They are both staring
at each other. Suddenly Fouad moves towards the front gate to leave in
a huff. Exasperated, Marie tries to stop him. Fouad stubbornly throws
himself on the ground and Marie struggles to get him back inside.
MARIE
Get back here! Come here!
FOUAD
I wanna go home!
Lea goes towards Fouad to help her mom and convince Fouad to come back
inside.
16. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS ROOM – EXT. YARD – DAY
Ahmad is standing near the window, watching the scene below. In the
yard, Marie is still struggling with Fouad. She finally wrestles him
into her arms and drags him inside.
17. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY AND THE CHILDREN’S ROOM – DAY
Marie is struggling to contain Fouad who is flailing his arms and legs
in resistance. She manages to bring him inside and sets him down on the
bed. Lea is scared, she follows them.
MARIE
I’m sorry!
FOUAD
I don’t care!
MARIE
(pleading)
Please, Fouad, calm down.
FOUAD
You’re not my mom.
Fouad refuses to calm down. With no other choice, Marie leaves Fouad in
the room, she locks the door behind her. Upset, Lea stands in the
corner of the hallway. Fouad beats against the door with his fists.
18. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY, BATHROOM AND TOILET – DAY
Marie has rolled up her sleeves. Despite the fact that she is running
late she decides to quickly clean the paint spill before leaving. Ahmad
comes down the stairs.
AHMAD
You should go, you’re late… I’ll clean
this.
MARIE
I’ll do it.
AHMAD

Not with your wrist, go.
MARIE
I thought you were leaving.
AHMAD
I’ll wait for Lucie. We’ll see after.
Marie gets up and rolls down her sleeves. She goes to the bathroom and
washes her hands and face. The occasional sound of Fouad beating his
fists against the door can still be heard.
MARIE
(worried)
You’ll keep an eye on them?
AHMAD
Go, don’t worry.
Ahmad goes towards the children’s room. He unlocks the door and enters.
Lea is still standing in a corner of the hallway, looking sad.
19. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – CHILDREN’S ROOM – DAY
As Ahmad enters, Fouad tries to escape. Ahmad grabs him and drags him
back in. Worried, Lea has come to the doorway.
AHMAD
Where are you going? Wait!
FOUAD
Let me go.
AHMAD
I’ll let you go. But first tell me
where you want to go.
FOUAD
I’m leaving!
AHMAD
Where to?
FOUAD
My house.
AHMAD
Where’s your house?
LEA
Paris. He can’t go, it’s too far.
FOUAD
Shut up! No one asked you.
AHMAD
None of that in this house! Got it?
Again Fouad tries to flee.

AHMAD
Lea, leave and close the door. We need
to talk.
Lea closes the door and leaves. Ahmad forces Fouad to sit on the bed
and gently sits down next to him.
AHMAD
What’s wrong Fouad? What is it?
FOUAD
I want to go.
AHMAD
You want to call home?
FOUAD
There’s no one in my home.
AHMAD
What’s the matter with here? Is it
because she told you off? But you were
misbehaving. You spilt the paint, you
caused trouble. Didn’t you spill the
paint?
FOUAD
It’s not the paint.
AHMAD
What is it, then? Is it because I’m
here? Do you want me to leave?
Fouad does not respond. He has calmed down a bit.
20. INT. DRYCLEANER’S – DAY
Long rows of clothing covered in plastic hang from rods running
parallel along the ceiling. Large laundering machines are on and
running. NAIMA, the young employee is covering freshly ironed clothing
with plastic bags. On the glass door of the drycleaner’s, a piece of
paper is taped which reads: “Experienced drycleaner’s help wanted.
Inquire within.” Marie quickly comes inside.
MARIE
Hello.
NAIMA
Hello, Ma’am.
Marie sees SAMIR’s feet among the rows of clothing. While holding some
dry-cleaned clothes on his arm, Samir comes to the front counter. He is
the man whose picture Ahmad had seen in the car. He acts coldly towards
Marie. Marie takes the car documents out of her purse and puts them on
the counter. Samir puts the clothing on the counter and on a piece of
paper, writes down the list of items and the cost for their cleaning.
MARIE
The plane was late.

SAMIR
He’s here?
MARIE
Yes.
Marie places the car documents in front of Samir.
MARIE
Here.
SAMIR
Where did you park it?
MARIE
Right there.
(pointing to the
documents)
You shouldn’t leave this in the car.
It’s risky.
Samir takes the receipt for the clothing along with the clothes and the
car documents from the counter to leave the drycleaner’s.
21. EXT. STREET – SIDEWALK – DAY
While holding the clothing on his arm, Samir is walking with Marie on
the sidewalk towards his car.
MARIE
Did you go to the hospital?
SAMIR
Yes.
MARIE
How was she?
SAMIR
Same as usual. Fouad’s not with you?
MARIE
Was he supposed to come?
SAMIR
He called me to go pick him up.
MARIE
(surprised)
Why?
SAMIR
He asked me to pick him up. He didn’t
want to stay there.
MARIE
I got upset with him. With both of
them.

SAMIR
I’ll come and take him home with me
tonight.
MARIE
No reason to make a fuss.
SAMIR
He’d never called me to go fetch him
like that.
MARIE
I’d never yelled like that.
SAMIR
Anyway, I promised I’d go fetch him.
MARIE
Ok. I shouldn’t have. We’ll make it up
tonight.
They have now reached the car. Marie unlocks the car and opens the back
door. Samir hangs the clothing on the rod above the backseat. He closes
the door and takes the keys from Marie to get in behind the wheeland
starts the car. Marie notices he is upset. Before the car drives off,
she taps on the glass. Samir rolls down the window.
MARIE
If you want to come over, let me know
first.
Marie takes off down the sidewalk. Samir is deep in thought. He puts
the car in gear. While driving, he watches Marie. Samir’s car slowly
passes her.
22. INT. PHARMACY – DAY
Marie enters a pharmacy, goes behind the counter and greets her
coworker, a middle-aged woman. She then goes to the back room, puts on
her white uniform and stands behind the counter.
23. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – EXT. – YARD – NIGHT
In the backyard, Ahmad is roasting corn. Lea is helping him and takes a
bite of one of the freshly grilled cobs. Ahmad fans the other corncobs
on the grill.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Corn, hot corn!
Lea mimics the sounds of his words. They laugh. Ahmad hands her another
corncob.
AHMAD
Here, take this for him.
Lea takes the corncob into the kitchen. In the kitchen, Fouad is
sitting at the table, cutting the corn stalk with a knife. Lea holds
the grilled corn out to him. He ignores her.

LEA
Take it.
FOUAD
I don’t want it.
Lea notices Fouad’s finger is bleeding.
LEA
You cut your hand.
FOUAD
No I didn’t.
LEA
Yes, you did. You’re bleeding!
Lea walks towards the door to the backyard.
LEA
Ahmad! He cut his finger!
24. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – BATHROOM AND HALLWAY – NIGHT
In the bathroom, Ahmad picks Fouad up, holds his finger under the tap
and washes it. Lea now comes into the bathroom with the first-aid kit.
Lea opens the kit. Ahmad pours some disinfectant over Fouad’s finger.
Fouad, who is clearly in pain, tries to be brave. They hear the front
door opening. Intrigued, Ahmad leans toward the bathroom door to see
who has entered the house. For a brief moment he sees LUCIE, Marie’s
sixteen-year-old daughter, as she quickly climbs the stairs to the
bedroom. He is relieved.
25. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY AND THE STAIRS – NIGHT
Ahmad goes upstairs. He knocks on the door and hides waiting to
surprise Lucie. He knocks again. Lucie opens the door and comes out.
Ahmad covers her eyes from behind. Lucie is startled.
LUCIE
Ahmad!
Ahmad removes his hands and they hug each other. From downstairs, Fouad
is standing in front of the bathroom and watching them.
AHMAD
How did you know it was me?
LUCIE
I knew you were coming today.
Ahmad is surprised at Lucie’s response.
26. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Ahmad, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen table and
having dinner. A complete Iranian feast, which Ahmad has prepared.
Fouad has cleaned his plate and turns to Ahmad.

FOUAD
Can I have some more?
Ahmad takes Fouad’s plate and serves him seconds.
AHMAD
Did you like it?
FOUAD
Very much!
Ahmad also serves a second helping for Lea. He wants to reserve Lucie’s
plate but she doesn’t let him.
LUCIE
No, it’s enough.
AHMAD
Come one, have some. You won’t get
real Ghormesabzi again soon. Unless
you two marry two nice Iranian guys...
and you, Fouad, an Iranian girl!
Lea laughs. So does Fouad.
LUCIE
How long will you stay?
AHMAD
Where?
LUCIE
Here.
AHMAD
It depends on how long our talk will
last after dinner.
FOUAD
(abruptly)
What are Iranian girls like?
AHMAD
Iranian girls… They look like me… but
they’re girls!
(jokingly)
How does that sound?... Like this…
Ahmad jokingly takes on the mannerisms of a woman. Fouad and Lea laugh.
LUCIE
What are we to talk about?
AHMAD
Have your dinner and I’ll tell you.

27. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – BACKYARD – NIGHT
Lucie is seated on the steps of the house leading down to the backyard.
Ahmad pours some water on the ashes of the barbecue and places it in a
corner. He picks up the cornhusks strewn on the ground and throws them
away. While doing all this, he is speaking to Lucie.
AHMAD
You always come home so late?
LUCIE
Just to sleep.
AHMAD
Why?
LUCIE
I have nowhere else to spend the
night.
AHMAD
Why don’t you want to sleep here?
LUCIE
Same as you. You’d rather go to your
friend’s tomorrow.
AHMAD
This isn’t my home.
LUCIE
But your friend’s place is?
Ahmad approaches Lucie and sits down next to her.
AHMAD
I’m not comfortable here.
LUCIE
Neither am I.
AHMAD
It’s not the same. For me, it’s hard
to face the guy who’s about to marry
my ex… it’s only normal.
LUCIE
Now, she’sjust your ex?
AHMAD
Well, yes.
LUCIE
Whatever.
AHMAD
What?
LUCIE

You lived here with her for years and
now she’s just your ex?!
AHMAD
Everything’s changed since then. We
got separated… You’re old enough to
understand that.
Lucie gets up to leave.
LUCIE
I’m old enough not to be preached at.
AHMAD
I’m not here to preach. Your mom asked
me to talk to you and see what’s got
into you. I don’t know why she thinks
you’d tell me more than you tell her.
LUCIE
She knows perfectly what’s got into
me. I don’t want to see that jerk
whenever I come home.
A long silence between them ensues. Lucie goes into the kitchen.
AHMAD
Lucie, wait!
28. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Lucie wants to leave the kitchen. Ahmad comes into the kitchen from the
backdoor. He wants her to stay.
AHMAD
Come and sit here.
Lucie sits unwillingly.
AHMAD
Isn’t he a good guy?
LUCIE
I don’t know him.
AHMAD
Why do you call him a jerk, then? What
has he done?
LUCIE
He hasn’t done anything. He has
nothing to do here.
AHMAD
Anyway, you have to accept the fact
that it’s your mom’s right to live
with whoever she wants.
LUCIE

Whoever she wants? Even a guy with a
kid and a wife in a coma?
AHMAD
(curious)
Fouad’s mom?
Lucie nods. A moment of silence.
AHMAD
And if she married someone else, would
you mind?
LUCIE
It’d be the same.
AHMAD
So your problem isn’t him.
LUCIE
No.
AHMAD
Then, what is it?
Lucie falls silent for a moment. Fighting back tears, she answers
Ahmad.
LUCIE
I’m sixteen years old and since I was
born, my mom’s changed guys three
times. And it’s always the same story.
They come, stay for a few years, and
then they leave.
Ahmad understands what Lucie means and has nothing to say in response.
He too is upset. He gets up with the excuse of clearing the dishes. He
has his back to Lucie. Perhaps to stop Lucie from seeing his reaction.
And again there is silence.
LUCIE
Would you talk to her?
AHMAD
About what?
LUCIE
Talk her out of this marriage.
Ahmad laughs at what Lucie has said; a bitter laugh. The sound of the
front door opening is heard.
29. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – GROUND FLOOR – NIGHT
Marie enters the house. From between the door to the children’s room
she sees Fouad and Lea who are not yet sleeping and talking to each
other. She is pressed to know if Lucie has come home. She throws her
purse and coat on her bed and enters the kitchen.

30. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Marie is elated to see Lucie. Lucie immediately gets up to leave the
kitchen.
MARIE
Good evening.
AHMAD
Good evening.
Lucie mumbles to her mother.
LUCIE
Good night.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Good night.
LUCIE
(imitating Ahmad and
in Persian)
Good night.
MARIE
Lucie, can you sleep downstairs
tonight? Fouad will go up with Ahmad.
AHMAD
I kept you some food. Haven’t you had
dinner?
MARIE
No.
Lucie leaves. Marie sees the food that Ahmad has kept for her. She
wasn’t expecting Persian food.
MARIE
Oh la la ! Thank you… Where did you
get the herbs?
AHMAD
We went shopping with the kids.
Marie sits at the table and starts to eat. Ahmad gets busy placing the
dishes in the dishwasher.
AHMAD
Do you want me to heat it up if it’s
cold?
MARIE
No… You’re still a great cook!
AHMAD
The one thing I’m stil great at. What
time must we be there tomorrow?

MARIE
9…
AHMAD
(Giving her a spoon)
You don’t eat Ghormesabzi with a fork.
MARIE
Did you talk to her?
AHMAD
Yes…
MARIE
And?
AHMAD
You can guess. She doesn’t like you
remarrying.
AHMAD
She’s worried that you’ll live with
him for a while and that he’ll take
off.
MARIE
Tell her to be sure that this one
won’t leave.
AHMAD
I don’t think I’m the right person to
convince her to be happy you’re
getting married.
MARIE
(a bit angry)
I ‘m not asking her to be happy. I
just want to know what she’s after.
AHMAD
Stopping this marriage.
Marie laughs nervously.
AHMAD
It made me laugh too.
Marie now stops laughing while chewing the food she has in her mouth.
Ahmad wants to leave.
AHMAD
Try to convinve her before you make
your decision.
MARIE
My decision’s made.
Ahmad leaves the kitchen. While eating her food, Marie is deep in
thought.

31. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS BEDROOM – NIGHT
The lights are out. Street light shines in through the window. Ahmad is
lying down on the lower bunk and Fouad is on the top. Both are having
trouble falling asleep. Fouad is looking at Ahmad from in between the
spaces in the slats of his bed; Ahmad’s hand, Ahmad’s mouth. He is
trying to find out if Ahmad is asleep, but he can’t see his eyes. Fouad
shifts restlessly. The bed squeaks. Ahmad hears him moving.
AHMAD
Fouad?
FOUAD
Yes?
AHMAD
If you’re not comfy, we can switch
beds.
FOUAD
I’m ok.
AHMAD
Then, why aren’t you asleep?
Fouad does not answer.
AHMAD
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
FOUAD
I have to pee.
AHMAD
Go, then. Go...
Fouad doesn’t move, Ahmad realizes that he is afraid of going down by
himself. He gets up to accompany him.
32. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – GROUND FLOOR – NIGHT
Ahmad and Fouad walk downstairs towards the restroom. Ahmad turns on
the light. Fouad goes inside and closes the door. Ahmad waits in the
dark hallway for him to come out. Marie’s bedroom is next to the
restroom. Ahmad notices the light pouring out from under Marie’s
bedroom door. He hears a noise from inside the room. He strains to hear
the muffled sounds of a conversation between two people. He is ill-atease. He doesn’t want to stay there. He walks back upstairs.
33. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS ROOM – NIGHT
Ahmad is distraught and cannot sleep. He is concerned that Fouad has
not returned.
34. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – BEDROOM – NIGHT
Samir is lying on the bed. Marie cradeling his head and putting eye
drops into his eyes. As she is doing this, they are quietly speaking to
each other.

MARIE
(quietly)
Did you talk to her doctor too?
SAMIR
No, just the nurse.
MARIE
What did she say?
SAMIR
About what?
MARIE
The scratches on her stomach.
SAMIR
They happened after my last two
visits.
MARIE
Maybe it has nothing to do with your
visits. Maybe it was involuntary.
SAMIR
You’d like it to be involuntary?
Marie is shocked by what Samir has said. She closes the eye-drop bottle
and sits on the edge of the bed. Samir closes his eyes to diminish the
sting. From Marie’s silence, he realizes that he has upset her.
SAMIR
I’m sorry.
MARIE
Do you hear yourself? You can’t say
whatever you want and then just
apologize.
Marie wants to continue the discussion but is interrupted by the sound
of someone knocking on the door. Marie gets up and opens the door.
Fouad is behind the door. It is clear that he is scared of the dark.
MARIE
What are you doing here?
FOUAD
It’s dark. I can’t go up.
SAMIR
Why do you want to go up?
MARIE
I asked him to go upstairs with Ahmad.
The girls are together.
SAMIR

Maybe he is not comfortable sleeping
with a stranger.
Samir gets up from the bed and comes towards Fouad.
SAMIR
Get your things. We’re leaving.
FOUAD
I’m spleepy. I want to go to bed.
SAMIR
You asked me to come get you!
FOUAD
I want to stay.
MARIE
You can sleep in my bed.
Fouad lies down on Marie’s bed. Marie tucks him in.
35. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN AND HALLWAY – MORNING
The next morning, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen
table finishing off their breakfast. The sink is full of water and
clearly clogged. Ahmad is sitting on the floor and is busy opening the
drainpipe under the sink. Marie who has taken a shower, enters the
kitchen.
MARIE
Ahmad leave it… we’re running late.
AHMAD
The sink is clogged.
MARIE
It can wait. We have to be there by 9.
Hurry up, kids.
Marie leaves the kitchen. Ahmad opens the drainpipe. All the water from
the sink pours into the bucket which Ahmad has placed underneath the
sink. Ahmad clears the clogged pipe and dirties his hands in the
process. Samir, who has just woken up, enters the kitchen.
SAMIR
Hi.
Lea and Fouad answer him. Lucie ignores his presence.
SAMIR
(to Ahmad)
‘Morning… Samir.
Ahmad whose hands are dirty, gets up to greet him respectfully but does
not offer his hand to shake.
AHMAD

My hands are dirty, sorry.

SAMIR
It’s blocked again?
AHMAD
It’s unblocked. I’ll just screw it
back on.
Samir joins the children seated at the kitchen table. As soon as he
sits, Lucie grabs her last bite and without saying anything leaves the
kitchen and walks in the hallway. She comes face-to-face with Marie who
is getting dressed.
MARIE
Get ready, Lucie, we’ll drop you off.
LUCIE
No need, I’ll go by myself.
Lucie goes to her room. Marie comes to the kitchen. Ahmad is still busy
reattaching the drainpipe. Samir is eating his breakfast. Without
sitting down at the table, Marie grabs a bite to eat.
MARIE
Ahmad, we’re late.
AHMAD
It’s finished.
Ahmad turns on the water to verify the pipe he has reattached does not
leak. Marie notices Samir who is pretending to be busy with his
breakfast.
MARIE
(to the kids)
Get moving, kids.
Lea and Fouad finish their breakfasts and leave the kitchen to prepare
for school.
AHMAD
It’s leaking.
MARIE
There’s always been a leak.
SAMIR
I told you the joint has to be
changed. I’ll take care of it.
MARIE
(to Ahmad)
Did you eat anything?
SAMIR
(thinks Marie is
talking to him)
Not yet.

Ahmad turns off the tap. He takes the bucket from under the sink and
leaves the kitchen. Marie and Samir are sitting at the table in the
kitchen concentrating on their breakfasts. They are both quiet.
36. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – TOILET AND BATHROOM – MORNING
Ahmad is ironing his shirt when Lucie gently opens the door and comes
in to wash her hands.
LUCIE
Can I see you after?
AHMAD
Don’t you have class?
LUCIE
I can skip.
Marie cracks the bathroom door open.
MARIE
Ahmad!
AHMAD
Coming…
(to Lucie)
What time do you get out of school?
LUCIE
One.
37. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – THE ROOM FACING THE YARD – EXT. FRONT YARD –
MORNING
Samir is wearing some work clothes and is standing on a step ladder
painting a wall. As he paints, he looks out the window and sees Marie
give the car keys to Ahmad. Samir has a strange feeling, as if seeing
them together bothers him. Lucie comes into the room to get something.
She has her backpack on her shoulder and is ready to go to school. She
wasn’t expecting to see Samir. Samir climbs down the ladder to help her
and pulls the plastic cover away from her things. Without paying any
attention to him, Lucie searches the computer desk for something and
does not find it. This is a good excuse for Samir to start a
conversation with her.
SAMIR
Looking for something?
LUCIE
No.
Lucie goes out. Samir is left alone.
38. INT. SAMIR’S CAR – EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LEA’S SCHOOL – DAY
Lea and Fouad are seated next to each other on the backseat. Ahmad is
behind the wheel and Marie is sitting in the passenger’s seat.
MARIE

Go right.
AHMAD
Isn’t that the school Lucie went to?
MARIE
Yes.
The car turns then stops in front of a school’s main entrance. Lea gets
out and Fouad follows her.
LEA
(while getting out)
Bye, Mommy.
MARIE
Bye, sweetheart.
FOUAD
(mimicking Lea)
Bye, Mommy.
MARIE
Bye! Wait, let me see…
Marie cleans the corner of Fouad’s eye with her finger. Lea and Fouad
go towards the school. The car drives off.
AHMAD
Where did you two meet?
MARIE
At the pharmacy, he’d come in for his
wife’s medication.
AHMAD
What was wrong with his wife?
MARIE
She was depressed.
Ahmad smirks. Marie notices his reaction.
MARIE
What?
AHMAD
What?
MARIE
(mimics Ahmad’s
smirk)
What’s that supposed to mean?
AHMAD
We call it a smile.
MARIE
We call it mocking. What’s funny about
it?

AHMAD
Miss our fights, darling?
MARIE
Is her depression funny to you?
Ahmad puts on the turning indicator and slowly pulls over.
AHMAD
(jokingly)
Look, if you start bugging me, I’ll
get out right now and go back to
Tehran. I won’t come to court and I
won’t divorce you and then let’s see
what you do.
MARIE
It’s just your hair that’s gone grey.
Nothing else has changed.
AHMAD
What should I do? Should I get out?
MARIE
Stop joking, we’re late.
Ahmad laughs and starts driving.
39. INT. COURTHOUSE – HALLWAY – DAY
Marie and Ahmad are sitting on a bench in a courthouse in the suburbs
of Paris..
MARIE
Seriously, what did you think of him?
AHMAD
First tell me how serious all this is,
then I’ll tell you what I think.
MARIE
Serious enough for me to be pregnant.
Ahmad, who is clearly shocked at hearing this news, tries to hide his
sadness and they both fall silent. The lawyer comes out of a room and
calls Marie, who gets up.
AHMAD
Is that a joke?
MARIE
No.
Marie enters the office accompanied by the lawyer. Ahmad lags behind
Marie, he is deep in thought.

40. INT. COURTHOUSE – ROOM – DAY
Marie and Ahmad are sitting in front of the judge’s desk and their
lawyer is seated between them. The judge reads their divorce agreement
and asks for their consent, with that the administrative stage of their
divorce is completed. During this procedure, Marie’s phone rings. She
quietly speaks a few sentences without being heard. The judge looks at
Marie with an expression that means she cannot speak on the phone. With
no other choice, Marie hangs up the phone.
41. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – YARD – DAY
Samir, who is still in his work clothes, is in the yard and is speaking
on the phone. His hands are covered in paint.
SAMIR
(on the phone)
Hello, Marie…
He hangs up, redials, then leaves a message. The airline company
representative, who has delivered Ahmad’s suitcase, is holding some
documents and waiting at the door. Ahmad’s damaged suitcase is on the
ground, its locks have been broken.
SAMIR
(on the phone)
Marie… they’ve brought the suitcase.
It’s broken. I don’t know if
something’s missing, if I should
accept it or not... Call me back.
Samir hangs up and goes towards the front door.
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
Okay?
SAMIR
What if something’s missing?
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
Doesn’t he have insurance?
SAMIR
I don’t know.
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
What do we do, then? Will you take it
or should I bring it back to the
airport and he can come and follow up
on it?
Samir goes towards the suitcase to pick it up.
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
Can you sign here?
The airline representative notices Samir’s eyes, which are wet and red.
Samir signs.
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE

Are you okay?
SAMIR
(surprised)
Why?
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
Your eyes…
SAMIR
Oh! I’m allergic to the paint.
AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
(while leaving)
Change jobs!
The airline representative goes towards his car to get in. His words
have put Samir deep in thought.
42. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LUCIE’S SCHOOL – DAY
Ahmad is standing on the sidewalk among the students filing out of
school, waiting for Lucie to come out. Lucie exits the the school. She
too is looking for Ahmad. Ahmad walks towards her.
43. INT. SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT – DAY
A typical neighborhood restaurant with an open kitchen located in the
back where the chefs are busy cooking. The ambience of the restaurant
is Italian. SHAHRYAR, the middle-aged and friendly owner, is taking a
customer’s order. The restaurant is bustling, most of the tables are
full of diners. Ahmad and Lucie enter the restaurant. They walk towards
Shahryar who has not yet noticed them.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Excuse me, where’s the bus stop to
Tajrish?
Shahryar looks up. He is shocked to see Ahmad.
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
What the hell are you doing here?!
Shahryar gets up from behind the till and comes towards Ahmad. They
both hug each other warmly and start joking and laughing.
AHMAD
(in Persian and
pointing to Lucie)
Do you recognize her?
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
She’s grown up.
(to Lucie)
Do you remember when you were little,
he’d put you on his bike and bring you
here?

AHMAD
(in Persian)
That was Lea… this is Lucie! You’ve
always mixed them.
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
How tall she’s become.
(to Lucie)
How are you?
LUCIE
I’m good.
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
You haven’t had lunch?
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Why else would we bother to come
here?!
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
Sit, I’ll be right with you.
Ahmad and Lucie move towards a table to sit down, Shahryar walks
towards the kitchen. Valeria, Shahryar’s Italian wife, is busy in the
kitchen..
SHAHRYAR
(in Italian)
Valeria, your friend’s here.
Valeria sees Ahmad. Ahmad walks towards her. She is happy to see Ahmad.
VALERIA
(in Persian)
Ahmad… Hello. How are you?
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Hello, dear Valeria.
SHAHRYAR
You remember Lucie?
LUCIE
Hello.
VALERIA
Hello… what a beautiful lady you’ve
become!...
Valeria warmly embraces Lucie.
AHMAD

You two are still together?
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
There is this tiny thing in common
between us to keep us from separating.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
What?
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
The colors of our flags.
AHMAD
(to Valeria)
What is he saying?
VALERIA
He talks too much… let him. How’s your
mom?
LUCIE
She’s good.
Valeria goes to the kitchen. Ahmad and Lucie sit at the table. Ahmad
picks up the menu to look it over.
LUCIE
Did you go to court?
AHMAD
Yes.
LUCIE
SO, it’s over now?
AHMAD
It was already over. You still like
ravioli?
Ahmad sets the menu down. He notices Lucie’s sad eyes, staring off into
the distance.
AHMAD
What is it?
Lucie does not respond.
AHMAD
You know, this guy... I don’t think
he’s that bad...
Lucie again does not respond.
AHMAD
He must be going through a difficult
time. Put yourself in his shoes.

Between his wife and his concern for
his son...
LUCIE
How does she want to marry a married
man?
AHMAD
But you said his wife’s in a coma.
LUCIE
But she’s not dead; she might not die…
AHMAD
That’s his problem. That’s no one
else’s business…
LUCIE
Do you know why his wife’s in a coma?
AHMAD
No, how would I know?
LUCIE
My mom didn’t tell you?
AHMAD
No.
LUCIE
She committed suicide.
Ahmad is shocked by what Lucie is telling him. He remains silent
saddened by what he has learned.
AHMAD
Because of her depression?
Lucie, who has until now fought back her tears, suddenly loses control
and start to cry. She tries to prevent the other diners from hearing
her but many of them turn to see why she is crying. Ahmad tries to get
her to calm down.
AHMAD
(quietly)
Lucie… look at me…
Worried, Shahryar comes to their table.
SHAHRYAR
What’s the matter?
AHMAD
Lucie… get up, we’ll get some fresh
air.
Ahmad takes Lucie’s hand and gets her up from the table.
SHAHRYAR

Take her to the back.
Ahmad leads Lucie to the small back room of the restaurant where she
can compose herself. Concerned by Lucie’s outburst, Valeria looks
questioningly at Shahryar. Shahryar shrugs.
44. INT. SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT – BACK ROOM – DAY
A small room with a bed and Shahryar’s personal things. In a corner are
boxes of soft drink, mineral water and food supplies. Ahmad sits Lucie
down on the bed and unties her scarf and puts it aside.
LUCIE
Do you know why she doesn’t tell
anyone that this guy’s wife has
committed suicide?
AHMAD
Calm down… calm down for now, we’ll
talk later.
LUCIE
Because she doesn’t want anyone to
find out.
AHMAD
What?
LUCIE
That it’s because of their affair that
she tried to kill herself.
Although he’s shocked, but Ahmad pretends to not take Lucie seriously.
AHMAD
You shouldn’t speak of these things
with such certainty… especially at
your age.
LUCIE
Then, don’t say I’ve grown up if you
don’t think so.
Lucie gets up to leave. Ahmad holds her and stops her.
AHMAD
Sorry.
Lucie sits down. More silence.
LUCIE
I don’t want them to be together.
AHMAD
You think it’s up to you and me? I’m
nobody in this story.
LUCIE

If they get married then I’ll never…
I’ll never set foot in that house
again.
AHMAD
Your mother is pregnant.
Lucie looks at him in disbelief.
LUCIE
You’re lying.
Lucie, emotionally drained, stands up and leaves the room. Ahmad
follows her.
45. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT – DAY – CONTINUED
Lucie exits the restaurant and starts walking down the sidewalk. Ahmad
walks next to her.
AHMAD
Wait…
LUCIE
You know why she went with that
asshole?... Cause he looks like you!
He reminds her of you!
Ahmad has no answer to give Lucie. Lucie leaves. Ahmad stands there for
a moment.
46. INT. LIGHTING STORE – DAY
An old shop in Paris. A large number of old and new chandeliers and
other lamps are hanging from the ceiling of the shop. All around the
store are table lamps in various sizes and shapes. Samir and Marie are
looking at the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling to pick something
out.
47. INT. SAMIR’S CAR – EXT. STREET – DAY
Several chandeliers and lamps are placed on the backseat. Samir is
sitting behind the wheel and Marie in the front seat. They drive
through the busy streets of Paris. Samir is deep in thought. Marie
senses it and quietly waits for him to speak. Without looking at him,
Marie gently reaches over to hold his hand and closes her eyes. A
moment later, Samir has to remove his hand in order to shift gears.
Marie opens her eyes. They drive on in silence.
48. EXT. STREET – INT. RER STATION – NIGHT
Ahmad comes up the stairs in a metro station. It is raining. He takes
the gift he has bought out of its plastic bag and pulls the bag over
his head to prevent his head from getting wet. He crosses the busy
street, reaches the sidewalk and hugs the wall as he walks to stay as
dry as possible.

49. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY – NIGHT
Marie walks towards the front door. She opens the door. Ahmad, who is
soaked from the rain, comes inside.
AHMAD
Good evening.
MARIE
You’re soaked!
AHMAD
It started pouring…
MARIE
Want a coffee?
AHMAD
No, I’ve just come to get my
suitcase. I can’t miss the last train.
MARIE
It’s right here. At least, wait till
the rain stops.
AHMAD
It’s not stopping soon.
Ahmad’s words have worried Marie even more.
AHMAD
Is Lucie back?
MARIE
No.
Worried, Ahmad leans against the hallway wall.
MARIE
Watch the paint.
Ahmad looks at his coat which is not stained with paint. He notices his
suitcase in the hallway. He walks towards it and sees the lock is
broken.
MARIE
It was broken when they delivered it.
AHMAD
Did you call her friends?
MARIE
I’ve called them so often looking for
her that I’m embarrassed to do it
again.
Ahmad finds his towel among the things in his suitcase and dries his
face. He tries to close the suitcase but it will not close properly.

MARIE
Did you talk to her today?
AHMAD
Yes. Can I have a piece of string or
something?
MARIE
You have a couple of suitcases left in
the shed. You can take one of them.
AHMAD
Are the kids sleeping?
MARIE
No.
Marie goes inside.
50. INT. MARIE’S YARD – SHED – NIGHT
Ahmad is in the shed looking for his suitcases, which he had left there
from a few years ago. From among the clutter piled up in a heap, he
pulls out two dusty suitcases. He unzips the larger suitcase. Some
clothing, a few black and white pictures of Ahmad from when he lived in
Paris and other personal items are in the suitcase. Seeing his old
belongings changes his mood.
51. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Marie is standing by the window facing the backyard. The intensity of
the rain can be seen. Samir is standing on the kitchen table and is
installing a chandelier. Ahmad comes in the back kitchen door with his
empty suitcase and heads towards the hallway. Marie and Samir briefly
look at the suitcase he’s holding. Ahmad leaves the kitchen in the
dominating silence.
SAMIR
Turn it on, please.
Marie walks towards the switch and turns on the light. The chandelier
is lit up. Samir comes down from the table. He notices how restless
Marie is. Ahmad enters the kitchen with the plastic bag holding the
gifts he has brought from Tehran and the gift he has bought for Fouad.
He places the gifts on the kitchen table and sits down.
AHMAD
Will you tell the kids to come here
before they go to sleep, so that I can
give them their gifts?
Marie is about to leave the kitchen.
MARIE
Should Fouad come too?
AHMAD
Of course.

SAMIR
But, he wasn’t supposed to get one.
AHMAD
I got him something today.
SAMIR
Can I ask you not give it to him?
AHMAD
(bewildered)
Why?
Marie is also astonished and is looking at Samir.
SAMIR
He’s done something wrong. He needs to
be punished…
MARIE
They should both be punished, then.
SAMIR
I can only speak for my son.
Samir’s words have upset Marie.
AHMAD
What’ve they done?
SAMIR
They took the gift out of your
suitcase.
AHMAD
(laughing)
But the gift was still in there.
SAMIR
I put it back. But we can’t let them
off the hook.
AHMAD
The suitcase was open, they got
tempted…
MARIE
(impatiently wanting
to leave)
I’ll ask them to apologize.
SAMIR
This way they’ll learn that there will
always be a way to get away with any
situation by apologizing.
AHMAD

But I’ve already told them I’ve
brought gifts… I can’t pretend now I
didn’t.
MARIE
(to Samir,
frustrated)
Can you please let go? I’ve already
scolded them enough.
SAMIR
(a bit upset)
I was just asking if it was possible.
Ahmad is in a dilemma. He doesn’t know how to respond, but Marie goes
to get the kids. Ahmad and Samir are standing opposite each other in
the kitchen. There is silence and the tension between them is palpable.
They avoid making eye contact with one another. Samir cannot stand this
situation any longer and gets up from the table with the excuse of
closing the window that Marie had left open when she was smoking her
cigarette. He sees the light in the shed, which Ahmad has left on. He
passes through the backyard in the rain and turns off the light in the
shed and comes back to the kitchen. Marie enters the kitchen with Lea
and Fouad.
LEA
Good evening.
FOUAD
Good evening.
AHMAD
(friendly)
Good evening, kids.
Ahmad takes the plastic bag to take out the gifts.
MARIE
No, first you both have to apologize.
LEA
I apologize.
Everyone is waiting for Fouad to apologize but he is quiet.
SAMIR
And you?
FOUAD
I didn’t take it from the suitcase.
SAMIR
But you were with her when she did it.
FOUAD
But I didn’t take it.
SAMIR

It doesn’t matter who took it. You
were together, you could’ve stopped
her.
Fouad is silent and does not respond. Angry, Samir stands up, walks
towards him and stares into his eyes. Ahmad is uncomfortable.
SAMIR
“I apologize”.
FOUAD
(reluctantly)
I apologize.
SAMIR
(commandingly)
“I apologize”!
FOUAD
(with no other
choice)
I apologize.
Samir goes back to his seat and sits down. Ahmad gives Lea and Fouad
the two boxes. For Lea a remote controlled helicopter and for Fouad a
giftwrapped box. The children thank him but they are not very pleased
with the scolding they have received.
52. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – CHILDREN’S ROOM – NIGHT
Lea and Fouad are in their beds.
LEA
You pretended like it was me.
FOUAD
I just said I didn’t take it.
LEA
That means it was me!
FOUAD
It was you.
LEA
But you told me his suitcase was open.
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have gone.
FOUAD
You didn’t have to listen. You didn’t
have to go.
LEA
I know why you’re mad. You didn’t get
a helicopter. You got colored pencils.
FOUAD
Shut up!

LEA
You’re crazy.
FOUAD
Shut up!
LEA
You’re insane.
FOUAD
Shut up!
Lea is upset at him. She gets up, takes her blanket and leaves the room
to sleep in another room.
53. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Marie holds the dress which Ahmad brought for her up to her body and
shows it to Ahmad and Samir. Both men are looking at Marie.
AHMAD
I got the size you used to wear.
MARIE
It still wear the same size.
AHMAD
I have a gift for Lucie too. I’ll give
it to her later.
MARIE
She’s never been so late.
Samir gets up from the table.
SAMIR
I’ll go look for her.
MARIE
Where?
SAMIR
I don’t know… nearby… in the streets,
at the station… where are the keys?
MARIE
You had them.
AHMAD
Can I come with you, if you don’t
mind?
SAMIR
(with no other
choice)
Sure. If you want.

Samir leaves the kitchen.
AHMAD
She might not want to come back with
him.
MARIE
Why did she cry at the restaurant
today?
AHMAD
Who told you?
MARIE
I called Shahryar and he said she
suddenly burst ito tears. She’s never
been this late. What have you told her
that has made her stay out until now?
AHMAD
(calmly)
You hadn’t told her you were pregnant?
MARIE
(worried)
You did?
AHMAD
I thought she’d let it go if she knew
…
MARIE
That’s why she’s not back. You weren’t
supposed to tell her.
AHMAD
I didn’t know. What kind of secret is
that, anyway? She’d have found out
someday!
MARIE
Not when she’s so upset.
AHMAD
Her problem is not your being
pregnant.
MARIE
What is her problem?
Ahmad seems reluctant to answer. Marie stands in front of him, waiting
for a reply.
MARIE
(a bit upset)
What’s her problem?... huh?
AHMAD

(with no other
choice)
She seems to know everything.
MARIE
Everything about what?
Samir comes to the kitchen door.
SAMIR
I can’t find the keys.
MARIE
(angry)
Well, look for them!
Samir is surprised to see Marie so up. Ahmad is visibly uncomfortable.
AHMAD
We’ll talk later.
MARIE
What do you mean by “knowing
everything”? I don’t understand.
AHMAD
She says that his wife committed
suicide because of your affair.
Marie gets even angrier upon hearing this. Ahmad, who feels that he has
said what he needed to say, tries again to leave.
MARIE
She committed suicide because…
AHMAD
I’ll call you tomorrow and we can
speak then.
Samir enters the kitchen to take his coat.
MARIE
(angrier)
The keys are not here.
SAMIR
I got them.
MARIE
So why you are here?
SAMIR
What do you mean? Does somebody mind
my being here?
MARIE
No, but…
SAMIR
Forget it.

Samir leaves the house and Ahmad tries to go outside with him.
AHMAD
(to Samir)
Wait, I’m coming.
MARIE
Ahmad… his wife had been depressed for
some time.
MARIE
Every time I’d take my clothes there,
I’d see her… You could tell that she
was unwell.
AHMAD
Why was she unwell?
MARIE
What do you mean why?
AHMAD
Nothing, forget it.
MARIE
Look, either don’t say something or if
you do, say it clearly.
AHMAD
You said every time you saw her, she
felt unwell...
MARIE
I didn’t say she felt unwell, I said
she was unwell!
AHMAD
Forget it. This is just getting worse.
MARIE
(quietly)
You’d really like to hear that it was
my fault if that woman committed
suicide?
AHMAD
(quietly)
I don’t want to hear anything. You
asked me to go and talk to your
daughter. I’m just telling what she
thinks. That’s all.
MARIE
She’s wrong. She must come and have a
conversation with me and I’ll tell
her.
AHMAD

Do you want to tell her what you told
me? Do you think she’s going to buy
that?
MARIE
Don’t you believe me?
AHMAD
Does that matter? She’s the one who...
MARIE
What’s so unbelievable about it?
AHMAD
I also find it hard to believe that
the mother of a five-year-old would
commit suicide because of depression.
MARIE
Look who’s talking! Have you forgotten
the state you were in? This woman
committed suicide another time when
her baby was nine-month-old! Was it
also my fault? I was with you, back
then!
Ahmad falls silent upon hearing this.
MARIE
Her depression started right after the
birth. Do you want to know what meds
Samir would come and get for her?
54. INT. AND EXT. SAMIR’S CAR – NIGHT
Ahmad and Samir are in the car, driving up and down the streets of
their neighborhood searching for Lucie.
SAMIR
How long are you staying in town?
AHMAD
I haven’t booked my return yet.
SAMIR
Couldn’t you have sent a lawyer to
take care of the divorce instead of
coming all this way?
AHMAD
Sure, but I wanted to come. I wanted
to see the kids, and Marie-Anne too...
to end on good terms.
SAMIR
But it doesn’t seem to be the end.
There’s still something going on.
AHMAD
No… What makes you think that?

SAMIR
When two people meet four years later
and start fighting again, it means
things are still unresolved.
AHMAD
We were arguing about Lucie.
They are both quiet now, searching the streets in silence.
SAMIR
Lucie’s problem is me.
AHMAD
No… it’s a misunderstanding.
SAMIR
About what?
Ahmad does not wish to answer.
SAMIR
Anything personal that I shouldn’t
know?
AHMAD
No...
SAMIR
I that case, I want you to tell me...
You may know Marie is carrying my
child. It’s not good for her to be
stressed out all the time, smoking so
many cigarettes...
AHMAD
I’m worried about her too. She didn’t
use to smoke.
SAMIR
I won’t let this girl destroy her
mother. If she has a problem, she…
AHMAD
She has no problem. I told you, it’s a
misunderstanding.
SAMIR
What is this fucking misunderstanding
that has been screwing our lives for
months?
AHMAD
Marie-Anne can tell you.
SAMIR
Leave her out of this.
AHMAD

She is making assumptions about your
wife.
SAMIR
She thinks she committed suicide
because of our relationship?
AHMAD
So you know...
SAMIR
I overheard your conversation.
AHMAD
Did you?
SAMIR
She did that because of a stupid story
with a customer.
AHMAD
I heard she was depressed.
SAMIR
Otherwise, she wouldn’t have tried to
kill herself for nothing. What can I
do if Lucie doesn’t believe me?
I can send her my employee. She saw
the whole thing.
55. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – GROUND FLOOR – NIGHT
Samir and Ahmad enter the house through the front door. Marie hears the
door open. Curious and restless, she comes out of the bedroom. From
Samir and Ahmad’s expression, she realizes that their search has been
fruitless. Samir places the umbrella in a corner and walks in.
SAMIR
We should call the police. They may
find her.
Concerned, Ahmad stands in the doorway. Marie approaches him.
AHMAD
Has she already stayed out all night?
MARIE
No, it’s the first time.
SAMIR
Maybe she went to her father’s.
MARIE
To Brussels?
AHMAD
He’s not in Paris anymore?
MARIE

No, he’s back in Brussels.
SAMIR
You think she can be there?
MARIE
(doubtful)
She’s on bad terms with him too.
SAMIR
Do you want me to call?
MARIE
(to Ahamd)
It’s better if you do it.
Samir brushes past Marie and goes to the bedroom. Ahmad is
uncomfortable with the request Marie has made.
AHMAD
I doubt she’d have gone to Brussels.
Marie notices that Ahmad would perfer not to call Lucie’s father.
MARIE
(upset)
Fine, I’ll do it.
AHMAD
Ok, give me his number.
Marie goes to get the number.
MARIE
Shahryar called twice. He wants you to
call him back.
AHMAD
Where’s the phone?
MARIE
In the kitchen.
Ahmad goes to the kitchen.
56. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – BEDROOM – NIGHT
Lea is lying down under the blanket on her mother’s bed. Samir is
feeling down and is seated on the edge of the bed. Marie comes in,
worried. She is looking for her address book. Everyone is quiet. Marie
sees that Samir is deep in thought, he running his fingers through his
hair.
SAMIR
Where did she get this idea?
MARIE
What idea?

SAMIR
About Celine’s suicide.
MARIE
I don’t know…
Marie finds her address book and starts to leave the bedroom. Before
exiting, she realizes that her reaction has upset Samir. She walks
towards Samir and sits next to him affectionately. Lea, who has not yet
fallen asleep, turns around and sees their backs facing her. Samir
takes the eye-drops and drops some medication into his eyes.
57. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN AND HALLWAY – NIGHT
Ahmad is holding the phone and speaking to Shahryar.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Okay, thanks.... Okay, I will... Bye.
Marie is standing there holding the phonebook and is waiting for Ahmad
to get off the phone to give him the number.
MARIE
Here.
AHMAD
What is it?
MARIE
Her father’s number. But try not to
worry him. He’s fragile...
AHMAD
She’s at Shahryar’s.
Marie is shocked and quiet.
AHMAD
She went to the restaurant and he took
her in.
Marie, who until now had tried to control herself, suddenly becomes
angry.
MARIE
But he called twice! Why didn’t he
tell me? He heard how worried I was!
Why didn’t he tell me? I’ve been
worried sick all night!
AHMAD
I’ll explain.
MARIE
(shouting)
Explain what? What do you want to
explain?
Samir, curious about the commotion, comes into the kitchen.

SAMIR
What’s the matter?
AHMAD
Nothing.
SAMIR
(firmly)
I’ve already asked you to go through
me!
AHMAD
(even more firmly)
And I ask you not to raise your voice
in front of me… okay?
Suddenly, everyone is quiet. Samir tries to control himself.
MARIE
Why didn’t he tell me she was there?
SAMIR
Who?
AHMAD
(to Marie)
Lucie made him promise.
SAMIR
He promised to hide a sixteen-year-old
girl in his house and not tell anyone?
AHMAD
What do you mean hide?!
SAMIR
(nervous)
Why has he taken her to his house?
AHMAD
He felt sorry for her.
SAMIR
Didn’t he feel sorry for her mother?!
Ahmad holds his tongue not to start a fight. Marie suddenly gets up to
leave the kitchen. She takes a few steps and as if forgetting
something, she comes back.
MARIE
(to Samir)
The keys.
SAMIR
Where are you going?
MARIE
She has to come back home.

AHMAD
Marie…
MARIE
She has to come here, sit her ass down
and listen!
AHMAD
Now?
MARIE
Right now!
AHMAD
She thinks we don’t know she’s there.
MARIE
I don’t care! I want her to come and
see the mess she’s put me in! I want
her to know that I didn’t cause this
woman’s suicide!
Fouad, standing in the doorway, has heard everything.
58. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – BEDROOM – NIGHT
Marie rushes to put on her raincoat. Samir is standing next to the door
and Lea is on the bed. Although her eyes are closed, it is clear that
she is not sleeping.
SAMIR
If you go to get her now, she won’t
come home with you.
MARIE
(angry)
Then, I’ll call the police to bring
her back. I swear I will.
SAMIR
The police will bring her back one
night. What about tomorrow night?
MARIE
Either she comes back here or she goes
and lives with her father in Brussels.
Marie comes towards the door to leave. Samir blocks her path.
SAMIR
She won’t come back as long as I’m
here.
They stare at each other in silence.
59. INT. SHAHRYAR’S HOUSE – NIGHT
The house is mostly dark, only one light is on in the kitchen.
Shahryar’s house is not very large. It has been decorated like an

Iranian home. The television is on and Shahryar is sitting on a sofa
opposite it. He is watching a football game. Two commentators fiercely
debating a referee call. They each present their own points of view.
The penalty sequence is repeated several times in slow motion and
graphics. The referee’s call cannot be confirmed. The doorbell ringing
interrupts the sound of the show. Shahryar gets up and walks towards
the door. He opens the door for Ahmad. Ahmad walks in with his
suitcase. Both men speak quietly.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Hello.
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
Hello… come in.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
Is she up?
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
She has fallen asleep… come in.
SHAHRYAR
Hardly here and already in trouble.
AHMAD
When did she come to you?
SHAHRYAR
It was late. I thought she had come
looking for you.
AHMAD
You should have called right then. Her
mother was so worried.
SHAHRYAR
How can I call you? You don’t have a
phone! I called the house looking for
you but you weren’t there. I was
afraid if I told her mother, that she
would find out and leave in the middle
of the night… What’s wrong with her?
AHMAD
She’s imagining things.
60. INT. SHAHRIAR’S HOUSE – BEDROOM – NIGHT
Without making any noise, Ahmad turns on the dim bedside lamp which is
near Lucie’s bed. He wants to gently wake Lucie up. He is still unsure
but without a choice, puts his hand on her shoulder and gently shakes
her.
AHMAD
Lucie…

Lucie opens her eyes and is surprised to see Ahmad next to her bed.
AHMAD
Sorry to wake you… your mom is waiting
for you.
Lucie who it seems has just realized where she is, is staring at Ahmad
without saying anything.
AHMAD
She wanted to come and get you. I
asked her to not come, I promised I
would take you back. Come on, get up.
Lucie sits up.
AHMAD
Where’s your jacket?
Lucie has only now realized what is happening.
LUCIE
I won’t go. I don’t wanna go back
tonight.
Lucie’s pleas leave Ahmad less certain. He doesn’t know what to do.
AHMAD
Then I’ll call her and you can tell
her that you’ll go back tomorrow
morning, okay?
Lucie doesn’t respond. Ahmad leaves the room to get the phone. Lucie is
sitting on the edge of the bed by herself. Ahmad comes back with the
phone and dials a number and waits.
AHMAD
(on the phone)
Marie-Anne? Hold on, please.
He gives the phone to Lucie and signals to her to speak.
LUCIE
(on the phone)
Yes?... I’m staying here tonight.
She listens for a long time to the other end. From Lucie’s face, it is
clear that her mother is speaking relentlessly and perhaps threatening
her. Lucie still does not speak. Ahmad is worried and is looking at
her. Marie has said what she wanted to say and hangs up.
AHMAD
Why did you hang up?
LUCIE
She did.
AHMAD
Let’s go.

LUCIE
No.
AHMAD
Get out of bed. Let’s go talk.
61. INT. SHAHRYAR’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Ahmad closes the kitchen door behind him. Lucie goes to the sink and
washes her face. Ahmad sits at the table and waits for her. Lucie sits
at the table opposite him.
AHMAD
I want you to listen carefully. I
don’t know how much you remember of
the last few months I was living with
your mother. Do you remember anything?
LUCIE
Uhum.
AHMAD
Do you remember the state I was in?
LUCIE
Yes.
AHMAD
I was always feeling down. I wasn’t
working, I stopped going out, I just
didn’t want to exist anymore. So, when
your mom says that woman committed
suicide because she was depressed, I
can understand what it means. Even
with a young child...
LUCIE
Did you often think of killing
yourself?
AHMAD
Yes, sometimes?
LUCIE
You never thought of drinking
detergent in front of Lea and me to
die?
AHMAD
(shocked)
What? No!
LUCIE
You think that a woman who goes to her
husband’s shop and downs a bottle of
detergent in front of her son and
collapses only means to die?
Ahmad is silent. Lucie is trying not to burst into tears as she did
earlier that day before finishing what she had to say.

LUCIE
Why didn’t she take pills and die in
her bed?
AHMAD
Look, we can spend the night imagining
things. But it’s all speculation.
We’ll see Samir’s employee tomorrow.
She has things to tell you.
Lucie is struggling to maintain her composure. Ahmad is deep in
thought. There’s a brief silence between them.
62. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – GROUND FLOOR – MORNING
Fouad is dressed, he takes his toothbrush from among the other
toothbrushes and comes out of the bathroom.
63. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – MORNING
Marie and Samir are in each other’s arms, lovingly.
SAMIR
Tell her I’ve left and she can come
back. It’s better if Fouad and I don’t
stay here for a while.
Marie pulls herself away from Samir’s embrace. Samir leaves the
kitchen. Marie remains alone in the kitchen
64. INT. METRO CAR – DAY
Samir and his son are sitting next to each other towards the back of a
metro car. The metro approaches a station. Samir takes Fouad’s bag and
goes towards the exit door. Fouad is sitting stubbornly in his seat.
The door opens and Samir gets off assuming that Fouad is behind him.
Suddenly he realizes that Fouad has not gotten off. Scared, he quickly
returns to the car and runs towards Fouad.
SAMIR
Come on, let’s go!
Fouad is being stubborn. Samir takes his hand. Fouad resist but Samir
manages to take him out of the car by force and drags him over to the
wall for a serious talk.
SAMIR
What is that about? Why don’t you get
off? Look at me!
FOUAD
I want to go back to Marie’s.
SAMIR
We have to go home for now.
FOUAD
You told me our home was there,
forever.

SAMIR
Yes, but some things have changed.
FOUAD
It’s because of the man who came?
Samir does not respond.
FOUAD
Because I misbehaved yesterday?
SAMIR
No.
FOUAD
Why doesn’t Lucie like you?
SAMIR
Because she thinks I want to take her
mommy away from her.
FOUAD
But she doesn’t like her mommy.
SAMIR
Of course she does. All children love
their mommies. Just like you miss your
mommy.
FOUAD
But Mommy’s not home anymore.
SAMIR
Would you like to go see her? Do you
want to go to see her tomorrow?
FOUAD
No.
SAMIR
Why?
FOUAD
She scares me.
SAMIR
Your mommy?
FOUAD
She’s dead.
SAMIR
Don’t say such things, Fouad. If she
was dead, they wouldn’t have kept her
in the hospital, with the machines.
FOUAD

If they take them away, she’ll die?
Why don’t they take them away?
SAMIR
Because we don’t know if she wants to
stay alive like this or if she wants
to die.
FOUAD
She wants to die.
SAMIR
(shocked)
Why do you say that?
FOUAD
She killed herself. It means that she
wanted to die.
Fouad’s words have upset Samir. He hug Fouad.
FOUAD
Sorry, Daddy.
65. INT. SHAHRIAR’S RESTAURANT – DAY
Naima is seated at one of the tables in the restaurant. Her gaze
reveals her state of anxiety. Ahmad and Lucie are seated opposite her
and they watch her curiously.
AHMAD
Did his wife work there too?
NAIMA
Yes, for a few days. Samir had brought
her to clear her head.
Naima takes the garment out from its cover and places it in front of
Ahmad and Lucie.
NAIMA
And that day, she had a fight with a
customer over this stain. The customer
said that the dress had been stained
at the cleaner’s. Samir’s wife said
no, it had it before it was brought in
to the cleaner’s.
AHMAD
That’s all?
NAIMA
To make things better, I told her to
leave the dress and come and get it
the next day. The customer said that
the next day would be too late,
because the dress belonged to a guest
of the hotel where she worked and the
guest was catching a flight that
afternoon. She said we had a couple of

hours to get the stain out… and I said
okay… Suddenly Celine started
screaming at me, saying it wasn’t for
me to say, that this dress had the
stain before we got it and it’s not
our problem. The customer started
yelling and even cursed. Samir’s wife
got upset and threw the dress on the
sidewalk. I didn’t know what to do…
They pushed each other around a bit,
and the customer decided to call the
police… So I asked her to let me leave
so that when the police comes, I
wouldn’t be there…
AHMAD
You work illegally?
NAIMA
Yes. But Céline said “you have to stay
and tell the police that when you got
the dress, it was already stained”. So
I called Samir without her seeing me
to and asked him to come quickly. When
he came and heard the story, he got
very angry with his wife and said
sorry to the customer and said he’d
pay for the dress. He asked her to
call the police and tell them that the
issue was resolved. The customer said
she’d do it only if his wife
apologized to her. And then Celine
started screaming and yelling at me
saying I had no right to call Samir
behind her back. I didn’t say
anything. I just took my purse to
leave, but Samir came and took my
hand, like this... He said I had to
stay. Instead, he asked his wife to
leave. In front of the customer, in
front of me, he threw her out… and I
stayed.
Now all three are quiet. Upset, Ahmad looks at the stain at the back of
the dress and Lucie stares at Naima who is upset.
AHMAD
How many days before her suicide was
that?
NAIMA
I think four or five days... Can I go?
AHMAD
Thank you.
Naima gets up. She takes the dress, says goodbye and leaves. Ahmad gets
up and accompanies her to the door. Lucie is still seated, lost in
thought. Ahmad returns to the table.

AHMAD
That’s what depression’s like. Small
things can suddelnly set you off.
LUCIE
(on the verge of
tears)
The day before her suicide, I
forwarded her all the love letters my
mom and Samir had emailed each other.
Ahmad is astonished. He is looking in disbelief at Lucie who has now
revealed her secret and does not even have the energy to cry. There is
silence between them.
66. EXT. SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT – SIDEWALK – DAY
Lucie exits the restaurant. They stand on the sidewalk together, she is
upset and looking at Ahmad.
AHMAD
What are you going to do now?
LUCIE
I’ll go to Brussels.
AHMAD
Don’t be silly. You won’t last a
minute there. You have to go back to
your mom’s.
LUCIE
I can’t wake up every morning and face
the guy whose wife is dead because of
me!I can’t look his son in the eyes.
AHMAD
Come sit down.
Ahmad seats Lucie down on the chair in front of the restaurant. He sits
opposite her.
AHMAD
Do you want me to help you?
LUCIE
(worried)
You’re not going to tell my mom...
AHMAD
Listen…
Lucie gets up.
LUCIE
(frantic)
No, I don’t want her to know.
AHMAD
Sit down!

LUCIE
I shouldn’t have told you.
AHMAD
Hold on, listen… You either keep this
to yourself and suffer for the rest of
your life, or you talk to your mom.
LUCIE
What’d that chage?
AHMAD
It might change her decision to marry
him.
LUCIE
He decision’s made, she’s pregnant.
AHMAD
What if she finds out about this after
her child is born? Then, it’d really
be too late.
LUCIE
If I’d felt like telling her, I
would’ve done it.
AHMAD
It’s not about you feeling like it or
not. You have to ask yourself if it is
important for your mother. She has the
right to know.
67. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – HALLWAY – DAY
Marie is busy putting away the groceries. From the hallway, Ahmad
quietly stands in the kitchen doorway. Marie doesn’t notice his
presence. She turns around, sees him standing behind her. She is
startled, screams, then laughs at her own reaction.
MARIE
You’re here?
AHMAD
I was upstairs with Lucie.
Ahmad comes into the kitchen.
MARIE
How was your meeting?
AHMAD
What meeting?
MARIE
With Samir’s employee.
AHMAD
Yeah. It was fine.

Ahmad helps Marie put away the groceries.
AHMAD
Had you told Lucie I was coming to
Paris?
MARIE
No.
AHMAD
How did she know, then?
MARIE
Did she know?
AHMAD
Yes.
MARIE
How?
AHMAD
I don’t know. Maybe she reads your
emails.
(showing a bottle)
Where do you keep this?
Marie takes the bottle of dishwashing liquid from Ahmad to put it in a
cupboard. Ahmad’s words have peaked her curiosity.
MARIE
Did something happen?
AHMAD
Shall we go for a walk?
MARIE
No, I’m tired. What’s the matter,
Ahmad?
Ahmad goes to the door to close it so that they may speak in private.
Ahmad sits down. Marie sits down opposite him. Marie is staring at him,
waiting for him to speak.
68. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS ROOM – DAY
Lea is sitting next to Lucie on the edge of the bed. A brief silence
between them. Lea looks at Lucie’s worried face.
LEA
You want to go live with Dad?
Lucie thinks for a moment then shrugs.
LEA
If you go, I’ll come with you.

LEA
LUCIE
You have to stay here with Mom.

LEA
I want to be with you.

LEA
LUCIE
It’s not a good idea.
LEA
Dad’s wife is a bit weird.
There is silence between them. Ahmad calls Lucie from downstairs.
Worried, Lucie gets up and leaves the room. Lea is watching her.
69. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY – KITCHEN – BACKYARD – DAY
In the hallway, before Lucie comes into the kitchen, Ahmad quietly
gestures to Lucie no to be worried and that her mother only wants to
speak with her. Lucie goes towards the kitchen. Marie is standing like
a zombie in the backyard behind the kitchen and smoking a cigarette.
Lucie slowly walks in and stands in a corner of the kitchen. She is
looking at her mother. A heavy silence. Marie realizes Lucie is in the
kitchen. She comes back inside. She is consumed by anger, her hands are
shaking with rage.
MARIE
Is what Ahmad said true?
Lucie nods. Marie suddenly loses control and lunges towards her. She
has burst into tears, she takes Lucie by the arms and shakes her
violently while crying and screaming at her.
MARIE
(crying)
Why did you do that to me? What did I
ever do to you?
Lucie shows no reaction. She too is crying. She does not defend herself
against her mother’s beating. It is clear that she is feeling sorry for
Marie. Ahmad who has heard the commotion, rushes into the kitchen to
separate Lucie from her mother’s grip. Marie is too angry to let Lucie
go. He manages to free Lucie and pulls Marie to a corner of the
kitchen. Lea has also come down and is witnessing this fight. Marie
suddenly starts punching her own stomach. Ahmad holds her hands to
prevent her from doing this.
AHMAD
Stop it, Marie! Calm down!
MARIE
You little shit!
AHMAD
Marie! Easy...
MARIE
Get your hands off me!
AHMAD
You promised not to do that.

MARIE
(to Lucie)
Get out of this house! Get out!
Again Marie tries to lunge at Lucie. Ahmad struggles to stop her and
sends Lucie out of the kitchen.
AHMAD
(to Lucie)
Go.
Marie aimlessly walks around the kitchen. Ahmad comes towards her to
try and calm her down.
AHMAD
She’s in enough pain. I asked her to
tell you. She could’ve stopped me from
talking to you. I could’ve asked her
to keep the secret. You’d have
preferred not to know anything for the
rest of your life?
Marie suddenly lashes out at Ahmad.
MARIE
Will you shut up!
AHMAD
Remember you’re the one who wrote
those emails. She only forwarded them.
MARIE
I don’t want to hear you. I hate it
when you lecture me! It disgusts me!
AHMAD
(to Lea)
Go to your room sweetheart…
Ahmad walks towards Lea, sends her out of the kitchen and closes the
door.
AHMAD
I’m not lecturing you! You asked me to
come here and talk to Lucie!
MARIE
(screaming and
crying)
Fuck off! I didn’t ask you here for
Lucie! I asked you to come here after
four years just to sign that fucking
piece of paper and then get lost
forever!
AHMAD

Listen. Why didn’t you ask me to come
last year? Why do I have to be here in
the middle of this shit...
MARIE
Screw you.
AHMAD
... without even knowing you’re
getting married?
MARIE
(angry)
Read your emails!
AHMAD
And you didn’t book me a hotel. And
you made me sleep next to his son.
Why?
MARIE
I sent you an your email...
AHMAD
You made me come here just to get
revenge. That’s all it’s about.
MARIE
(angry and sarcastic)
Yes, you’re right. Happy?
AHMAD
Just before seeing the judge, you tell
me you’re pregnant. Why?
MARIE
Do,’t you want to get out of here?
Just leave for good? Please...
Lea runs into the kitchen.
LEA
She’s leaving!
Ahmad is worried. He comes out of the kitchen with Lea. Angry and
frustrated, Marie sits at the kitchen table.
70. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – STREET – DAY
Lucie, her eyes puffy and teary, walks quickly down the street. Ahmad
runs after her.
AHMAD
Lucie!… Lucie!
Although she can hear him, Lucie does not respond to his calls. Ahmad
reaches her and blocks her path.
AHMAD
Where are you going?

Lucie does not respond and tries to go around him. Ahmad grips her
hand.
AHMAD
(firmly)
Come back!
LUCIE
Who are you to boss me around?
Ahmad has nothing to say to her.
AHMAD
Lucie, your mother is not feeling well
right now. Plese, don’t make it worse.
LUCIE
Why did you tell her?
AHMAD
You said I could.
LUCIE
You left me no choice.
AHMAD
I wanted to spare you suffering.
LUCIE
Am I not suffering now? Am I well?
Ahmad does not respond. Lucie pulls her hand from his and leaves. Ahmad
is upset. Lucie continues walking, then again she stops.
LUCIE
Can you lend me some money?
AHMAD
Wait, I’ll come with you.
Lucie waits at Ahmad’s insistence. Ahmad rushes back to the house and
goes inside.
71. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – HALLWAY AND KITCHEN – DAY
Ahmad is rushing down the stairs and putting on his coat. He comes
towards the kitchen. Lea is standing in the kitchen doorway. Dazed,
Marie, who has stopped crying, is sitting at the kitchen table.
MARIE
Wait… I’ll go.
Marie comes out of the kitchen and walks towards the front door. Lea is
looking at Ahmad who is standing there not knowing what to do. Ahmad
comes towards her. Together they walk into the kitchen. Ahmad sits on
the chair and Lea gently leans against him and stands there.
LEA

What was in those emails?
AHMAD
I don’t know…
72. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – STREET – DAY
Marie has reached Lucie who is standing on the side of the road. She
quickly looks at her in silence.
MARIE
Come back home.
Lucie looks at her mother in silence.
MARIE
Let’s get back in.
73. INT. SHAHRYAR’S HOUSE – WORK ROOM – DAY
Ahmad is sitting at a workbench.
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
Ahamd, look at me. Don’t get sucked
back into this. Cut. Remember Mitra
and me? Cut. Life goes on without you
and me.
AHMAD
(in Persian)
I think to myself if I hadn’t left
four years ago...
SHAHRYAR
(in Persian)
You would’ve left a year later… if
not, two years later. I told you from
the beginning, you were not made for
this place. You have to choose. It’s
either one way or the other. You can’t
have it both ways.
Ahmad has nothing to say to Shahryar.
74. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – NIGHT
Marie is holding her phone, full trepidation, she paces back and forth
in the kitchen. She dials a couple of numbers, but she changes her mind
and hangs up. Lucie quietly comes into the kitchen from the hallway.
She is looking at the phone in her mother’s hand.

.
LUCIE
Are you going to tell him?
Marie just looks at Lucie. She has no answer.
LUCIE
You don’t have to.

Marie thinks of what Lucie has said. She sits down at the kitchen
table.
MARIE
Go to bed. And turn off the light,
please.
Lucie turns off the light and leaves the kitchen. Marie places the
phone on the table and stays there in the darkness.
75. EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE DRYCLEANER’S – DAY
Marie is walking down the sidewalk. It’s a long walk to the
drycleaner’s. From her eyes, it is clear that she has not had a good
night’s sleep.
76. INT. DRYCLEANER’S – DAY – CONTINUED
Marie enters the drycleaner’s. Naima is busy getting the clean clothing
out of the large washing machine. Fouad is busy drawing in a corner.
Naima notices Marie who has now come to this side of the counter.
NAIMA
Hello, Ma’am.
MARIE
Hello. Is Samir here?
NAIMA
He’s upstairs.
Marie goes towards the back door.
77. INT. SAMIR’S HOUSE – STAIRWAY – DAY
Marie climbs the narrow stairway, which connects the dry cleaner’s to
Samir’s house on the second floor. She rings the doorbell.
78. INT. SAMIR’S HOUSE – DAY
A small house located above the dry cleaner’s with windows facing the
street. It is clear that life has not flowed in this house for some
time and everything is a mess. From the vanity drawer, Samir takes out
the half-full perfume bottles belonging to his wife. Marie is standing
a bit further away.
MARIE
What’s all this?
SAMIR
Her perfumes. I’m taking them to the
hospital.
MARIE
What for?
SAMIR

For a test. One of her nurses was
saying that the memory of smell is the
last one you lose.
A silence ensues. Samir places the perfume bottles on the table. Marie
is staring at the perfumes. She takes one of them and looks at it.
MARIE
That is your cologne...
SAMIR
She liked it.
Samir has noticed something suspicious in Marie’s expression.
SAMIR
What?
MARIE
Nothing.
SAMIR
Why don’t you sit?
MARIE
I have to go.
Marie is not feeling like she usually does. He is waiting for her to
speak.
MARIE
I don’t like it when hide your
feelings.
SAMIR
I’m not hiding anything.
MARIE
You mean you are not happy?
SAMIR
About what?
MARIE
Is it not good news that there is
still hope that she can react to
something?
SAMIR
What do you want me to say?
MARIE
You’re stuck between your wife and me.
SAMIR
You ralized that overnight?
MARIE

I’ve felt it for a long time.

SAMIR
Since when?
MARIE
What do you mean?
SAMIR
You didn’t say things like that until
last week.
The weight of Samir’s coment sinks in.
MARIE
I always felt it but I wasn’t brave
enough to tell you earlier. Maybe I
wasn’t sure of what I felt.
SAMIR
What do you feel?
MARIE

That I am only here to fill the
void left by your wife.
Samir is hurt by Marie. A brief silence.
SAMIR
Whose void am I supposed to fill in
your life?
MARIE
(upset)
No one’s.
SAMIR
Are you sure?
MARIE
Of what?
SAMIR
I’m not here to make up for your
failed marriage ?
MARIE
If that was the case, I wouldn’t be
carrying your child.
SAMIR
That was an accident.
MARIE
I could’ve not kept it.
SAMIR
You kept it because you wanted to
erase that man, to convince yourself
that it was over, that you’d turned

the page and you were starting
something new with someone else. But
the problem is that you’re still not
convinced. Otherwise, you wouldn’t
have brought him home, you’d have let
him go to a hotel.
Marie is staring at him.
SAMIR
Ever since he’s come back, you’ve
changed. I don’t even recognize you
anymore.
MARIE
I feel this way because I’ve found out
why your wife...
SAMIR
Leave her out oh this, please.
MARIE
She knew...
SAMIR
You sound like your crazy daughter.
SAMIR
If she’d known, she’d have said
something to me at some point.
MARIE
She never asked about me?
SAMIR
Ask what?
MARIE
I don’t know. Why I came so often...
SAMIR
For her, you were just a customer.
MARIE
What about you? Didn’t she suspect
you?
SAMIR
No. I wish she had. At least, it’d
have meant she cared enough to try and
find out if there was someone else.
Marie is silent for a moment. Samir places the perfumes inside a box.
Marie gets up to walk towards the door.
MARIE
Lucie sent her our emails.
Samir is shocked, staring at Marie. There is a heavy silence between
them.

SAMIR
How’d she get her email?
MARIE
Your wife gave it to her.
SAMIR
But they never met...

MARIE
Lucie called her at the shop and told
her she had emails we had sent each
other and that she wanted to forward
them. Your wife accepted.
Samir stares at Marie in disbelief. Again, there is silence between
them.
SAMIR
When did she call her?
MARIE
The day before her suicide.
Samir drops his gaze and stares at the perfumes. Marie leaves his
house.
79. INT. DRY CLEANER’S – DAY
Samir enters the dry cleaner’s from the back door. He is preoccupied.
Naima is writing up an order for a customer. He waits for the customer
to leave. He is looking at Fouad who is still drawing in his notebook.
As soon as the customer leaves, he calls Naima.
SAMIR
Naima… come here a second.
Naima walks towards Samir.
SAMIR
After the fight with Celine... you
know, when I asked her to go... did
she ever come by the shop when I was
out?
NAIMA
No.
SAMIR
What about when she wanted to go
upstairs? Would she pass through
here?
NAIMA
I didn’t see her the last few days.
SAMIR
She was always up there?

NAIMA
She only came down the day it
happened.
SAMIR
Not the day before?
NAIMA
No, why?
SAMIR
Someone says that they called here and
talked to my wife.
A costumer comes and Naima goes to her.
80. EXT. STREET OPPOSITE PHARMACY – INT. PHARMACY – DAY
Upset, Marie is filling the prescription for a customer. She spots
Samir who is waiting for her outside the pharmacy. She quickly gets the
prescription for the customer and sends her to the register to pay. She
comes out of the pharmacy. Her co-worker who is ringing up the
customer, is frustrated with Marie’s sloppy work. She glances outside
and sees Marie and Samir talking.
81. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM – NIGHT
A small lamp is on. Marie is lying on her bed by herself and she is
staring out into space. The door gently opens. Lucie comes in. Marie
realizes Lucie is there but shows no reaction. Lucie comes towards the
bed. She pulls the blanket to the side and lies down next to her mother
who has her back towards her. She pulls the blanket over herself. For a
moment, they lie like this side by side. Lucie turns towards her
mother. She holds her from behind. Marie takes her hand and presses it
to her chest.
LUCIE
I’m sorry, Mom.
MARIE
Promise not to lie to me again.
LUCIE
When did I lie to you?
MARIE
When you say you’d forwarded the
emails.
Lucie is shocked at hearing this but she does not respond. From her
look, it is clear that she is debating whether to speak or to remain
silent.
MARIE
You promise?
Lucie remains silent.
MARIE

Okay?
LUCIE
Why do you think it was a lie?
MARIE
Because she wasn’t at the shop the day
before her suicide.
Again Lucie is silent. She lets go of her mother and turns onto her
back. She stares at the ceiling. Marie is surprised at her reaction and
turns her head towards her. She looks at Lucie. Lucie speaks in
response to Marie’s inquisitive gaze.
LUCIE
I spoke to her.
MARIE
No.
LUCIE
Yes. She had an accent.
MARIE
His wife is French.
Now they are both thinking the same thing. Marie is worried.
82. INT. DRYCLEANER’S – EXT. SIDEWALK – MORNING
Samir is waiting for Naima to arrive, it is clear that he is extremely
upset and angry. A brief moment passes. Naima enters.
NAIMA
‘Morning.
Naima goes to the back, takes off her jacket and hangs it up along with
her purse. Samir stands opposite her and stares into her eyes. Naima is
worried.
SAMIR
Why did you do it?
NAIMA
Do what?
SAMIR
Why did you pretend to be my wife and
gave her email?
Naima is scared. She does not react. Samir is angry, still waiting for
her to answer.
SAMIR
Well?
NAIMA
Sorry.
SAMIR

I’m not asking for an apology. I’m
asking why!
NAIMA
She didn’t like me.
SAMIR
What?
NAIMA
She hated me.
SAMIR
Had you done something?
NAIMA
No.
SAMIR
Then why did she hate you?
NAIMA
She thought there was something going
on between us.
SAMIR
She thought that? Why would she?
Naima is silent.
SAMIR
Why would she think that?
NAIMA
Because you hired me even though I was
illegal… she was suspicious.
SAMIR
Did she say anything to you?
NAIMA
No.
SAMIR
Where are you getting this crap then?
NAIMA
She was always after me, so I
thought...
Fouad, just woken up, has opened the back door and come inside.
SAMIR
You thought?... Get out. She never
asked me to fire you.
NAIMA
But she kept doing things to get you
to fire me…

SAMIR
Like what?
NAIMA
Lots of things.
SAMIR
What kind of things?
NAIMA
The day of the fight, the customer
called the police, she wouldn’t let me
leave, she wanted me to stay.
SAMIR
So what?
NAIMA
She wanted the police to find out
about me.
SAMIR
That’s it? That’s why she’s in a
coma?... Get out.
NAIMA
That dress… I took it out of the
machine. I took it, I ironed it, I
wrapped it up... there was no stain!
She made the stain, I’m sure. I’ve
been here for a year, I’ve never seen
a stain like that.
SAMIR
How much do I owe you?
Again Naima does not respond. Samir comes to the counter. He takes out
some money from his pocket. He puts several bills on the counter and
goes out to the sidewalk. Fouad is staring at Naima who is upset and
walks towards her jacket and purse.
83. EXT. DRYCLEANER’S – SIDEWALK – DAY
Samir is on the sidewalk. He is clearly upset. Carrying her purse on
her shoulder, Naima comes out of the drycleaner’s. For a moment she
pauses, then goes back towards the Samir.
NAIMA
I wanted her to know there was nothing
between us. You were always upset,
thinking about someone else , she
thought it was me. The day of the
fight, you asked me to stay, you took
my hand and you asked her to leave. I
saw her eyes for a second, I knew what
she was thinking.
SAMIR
(angry)

Because of what you did, this kid’s
mother has been a vegetable in a
hospital bed for the past eight
months.
NAIMA
It’s not because of what I did.
SAMIR
You gave her email to that brat.
NAIMA
If she had read the emails, she would
have understood everything. Why’d she
have come and drunk the detergent in
front of me? She’d have gone to the
pharmacy and killed herself in front
of her. Or upstairs, in front of you.
Why in front of me?
Samir has no response. Sad, Naima walks off and grows small in the
distance. Samir is even more frustrated than before.
84. INT. DRY CLEANER’S – DAY
Samir reenters the shop. He closes the front door. He moves to the back
of the shop and walks through the racks of clothing. From among the
clothes, he finds the dress Naima was talking about. He brings it down.
He takes its cover off. He searches for the stain, looks at it
carefully and smells it.
85. INT. SAMIR’S HOUSE – BATHROOM – DAY
Samir and Fouad are in the bathroom. Fouad is sitting on the edge of
the bathtub and Samir is clipping his fingernails.
FOUAD
She’s not coming back?
SAMIR
Who?
FOUAD
Naima.
SAMIR
No.
FOUAD
Why?
SAMIR
She did something wrong.
FOUAD
But she said sorry.
SAMIR
Some things are unforgivable.

FOUAD
Like what?
Samir doesn’t know how to explain what’s happening to Fouad. He just
looks at him. He holds up his other hand and continues to clip his
nails. He sees the band-aid on his finger.
SAMIR
What happened to your finger?
FOUAD
Nothing.
Samir takes off the band-aid.
FOUAD
I want to go back to Lea’s.
SAMIR
We can’t go for now.
FOUAD
When then?
SAMIR
Not as long as we don’t know about
Mommy.
FOUAD
When will we know?
SAMIR
(frustrated)
I don’t know.
FOUAD
I get bored here by myself.
SAMIR
Why don’t you come down to see me?
FOUAD
I don’t like it downstairs.
Samir looks down and continues clipping his nails. It is clear that he
is trying to hide the tears he feels after what Fouad has said.
86. INT. PHARMACY – EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY
Samir walks along the sidewalk. He reaches the pharmacy. Without
stopping, he sneaks a peak inside the pharmacy. Marie is busy filling
the prescription for an old male customer. Samir passes the pharmacy,
and turns onto the next street. He stops a few yards away. He paces
back and forth for a bit. He is hesitant. He goes back the same way he
came, this time without looking inside the pharmacy. He goes back
towards the drycleaner’s. He ears Marie’s voice from behind him.
MARIE
Samir!

He stops and sees Marie who has come out of the pharmacy and is
standing on the sidewalk.
87. INT. DRY CLEANER’S – EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY
Fouad is busy drawing in a corner of the drycleaner’s. The glass door
of the store is locked. Samir and Marie are on the sidewalk and have
reached the door. Samir unlocks the door and they both come inside. He
again locks the door from the inside. Fouad comes out form between the
clothing racks.
FOUAD
Hello.
MARIE
Hello.
Marie goes towards him. She kisses him.
SAMIR
(to Fouad)
Go upstairs, Fouad.
FOUAD
And then I’ll go with Marie?
SAMIR
Go get your things. Make a drawing for
Mommy, ok?
Samir accompanies Fouad to the back door. Fouad leaves. Marie sits on a
chair by the counter.
MARIE
Do you think she got our emails?
SAMIR
I don’t know.
MARIE
If she’d read them, she would’ve at
least said something to you.
SAMIR
Since the fight with the customer,
we’d stopped speaking. It lasted until
the end.
MARIE
Even if she’d read them, yesterday you
said she wouldn’t have cared.
Samir is silent.
MARIE
Would she have cared?
SAMIR

Maybe.I don’t know. I’d rather talk
about now. That was then. It’s over.
What I know now is that you’re
carrying our child. We just have to
forget.
MARIE
Is that possible?
SAMIR
It should be.
MARIE
What if it isn’t?
Marie is deep in thought.
88. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – EXT. BACK YARD – DAY
Ahmad is standing in a corner and watching Marie who is filling the
kettle in the sink.
AHMAD
Is your wrist better?
MARIE
It still hurts a bit.
AHMAD
You went to see a doctor?
MARIE
It’s normal. It’s the lack of calcium.
The baby’s taking it all.
AHMAD
How far along are you?
MARIE
A bit more than two months.
AHMAD
I thought you’d hurt yourself
painting.
MARIE
I don’t know, maybe.
There’s a brief silence between them. Marie places the kettle on the
stove and turns it on.
AHMAD
There’s something I want to tell you
before I go.
MARIE
About what?
AHMAD
About when I left four years ago

MARIE
It’s pointless now.
AHMAD
I want to explain why I didn’t...
MARIE
No… I don’t want to look back anymore.
Forget it.
Again there’s silence.
AHMAD
I’m off, then.
MARIE
And your things in the shed?
AHMAD
I don’t want them.
MARIE
Take them.
Ahmad notices Marie’s state. From the kitchen door, he enters the
backyard to gather his belongings in the shed.
89. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE – YARD – DAY
Ahmad comes to the yard holding a dusty suitcase. Lea and Fouad are
busy playing with Lea’s helicopter. Ahmad goes towards Lea and hugs
her. Fouad is watching them. Lea smiles. Ahmad looks at Fouad and also
hugs him.
90. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE – UPSTAIRS ROOM – EXT. YARD – DAY
Lucie looks out at the yard from the window of her room. She watches
Ahmad say goodbye to Lea and Fouad and walk toward the front gate. The
children see him off. Ahmad goes onto the street. To better see him
leave, Lucie places one foot on the bed and raises herself a little.
Ahmad fades into the distance. Lucie stays there till Ahmad disappears
from view. Once he is gone, she comes down from the bed.
91. INT. HOSPITAL – HALLWAY – DAY
Samir is in the hallway outside the door to his wife’s room and he is
looking inside the room.
92. INT. HOSPITAL – HALLWAY AND PATIENT’S ROOM – DAY
From Samir’s point of view, a doctor and nurse can be seen in the room
in which Samir’s wife is in a coma. They are performing tests and
examining her.
93. INT. HOSPITAL – HALLWAY – DAY
Curious, Samir has approached the door. The doctor comes out of the
room. Samir’s inquisitive eyes are directed at him. The specialist
takes Samir aside.

DOCTOR
Unfortunately she had no reaction.
SAMIR
None?
DOCTOR
None that I registered.
SAMIR
You mean the scratches on her stomach,
were involuntary?
DOCTOR
Possibly. As I told you, these tests
don’t reflect her state of
consciousness.
SAMIR
But she’d never scratched herself
before.
DOCTOR
I really can’t say. The nurses may
have done it when moving her in her
bed. Theses patients have fragile
skin.
SAMIR
Doctor... how can I be sure it’s not
her?
DOCTOR
By doing further tests. But even if
the other tests results are negative,
there’ll still be room for doubt. In
these cases, you can never be sure.
The doctor leaves. From the doorway, Samir is looking inside the room.
The nurse who is busy collecting the perfumes, comes out of the room
and walks towards Samir.
NURSE
I put the perfumes by her bed.
SAMIR
Did you test all of them?
NURSE
No just a couple of them.
The nurse leaves. Samir enters the room.
94. INT. HOSPITAL – PATIENT’S ROOM – DAY
Samir comes into the room. His ill wife is lying motionless on the bed.
On the walls are drawings which were drawn by Fouad. Samir takes the
box of perfumes to reluctently leave the room. As he exits, he
hesitates and goes back to his wife’s side. He sits by her on the bed

and stares at her. He takes the men’s cologne, the scent which he knows
his wife liked, and pours some of it onto the palm of his hand. He
holds his hand gently in front of his wife’s nose. He lowers his head
towards her ear and whispers something to her. He stares at her hand
and feet to see a reaction. He keeps holding his hand up to her face.
He places his finger in Celine’s motionless hand.
SAMIR
If you can smell the perfume, squeeze
my hand, Celine.
He keeps watching his finger and Celine’s hand. The end titles appear
and fade on this shot.
