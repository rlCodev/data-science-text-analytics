INT. MAGIC CASTLE – STAIRWELL - DAY
MOONEE (6) and SCOOTY (7) are outside The Magic Castle Motel,
purple and run-down. The kids sit against the wall in the
shade of an alcove under the stairs outside the main office.
The two take turns playing a game on a phone.
They hear a small boy, DICKY (7), calling from the distance.
DICKY
Moonee! Scooty!!
What!?

MOONEE

DICKY
Mooneeeeeeeeee!
Dicky makes his way to the enclave moving fast.
WHAT!!??

MOONEE

Steadicam: Begin close on Dicky's screaming face and
CONTINUOUS move from the side road parallel to Route 192 to
behind Dicky, following him running towards the motel.
WHAT!!!!?

MOONEE (CONT’D)

Dicky arrives at the enclave.
DICKY
Freshies at The Future!
Moonee and Scooty are enthralled.
MOONEE / SCOOTY
Freshies at The Future!!!
They jump up and exit frame. We hold on the purple wall.
“Celebration” by Kool & the Gang blasts over the OPENING
TITLES that play out as we continue to hold on the wall.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Dicky make their way to the end of the
motel’s driveway. PAN RIGHT to follow them and reveal Route
192 in full.

2.
The kids run to the adjacent property -- FUTURELAND INN
(located a block West from The Magic Castle).
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Moonee/Scooty/Dicky arrive at the entrance to FutureLand.
Scuffed-up retro-futuristic rockets adorn the weather-damaged
sign in front, its logo embedded within a constellation. A
faded ‘Stay in the future... today!’ sign dangles below it.
Moonee/Scooty/Dicky run off the sidewalk and onto the lawn of
the shanty motel.
They peer around a dirty wall. Their eyes widen.
DICKY
That one. The blue one.
The kids run upstairs to the second floor and look toward the
ground halfway down the walkway. They begin spitting
downward.
DICKY (CONT’D)
I can get it farther than you,
Moonee.
MOONEE
No way. I’ll totally get it much
farther than you!
SCOOTY
Yeah but I bet none of you can get
it on the top!
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - JANCEY’S ROOM - DAY
GRANDMA STACY (younger than your average Grandma) steps out
onto the walkway. She lights a cigarette, taking in her new
environment. She looks to her left where a YOUNG MAN and his
PITBULL are lounging down the walkway. She nods to him.
She continues to smoke. Something grabs her attention. She
approaches her blue 90’s Toyota Corolla to see a spit-covered
windshield. A gob of spit shoots down onto it from above. She
looks to the upper floor.
GRANDMA STACY
What the fuck? HEY!
Moonee/Scooty/Dicky slide back and laugh.

3.
GRANDMA STACY (CONT’D)
Are you kidding me over here? You
get down here and clean this shit
up now!
The commotion causes Jancey and her young sister LUCI (4) to
emerge from the room.
The kids continue to LAUGH HYSTERICALLY.
Moonee jumps up and spits blindly through the rail.
DICKY
Go home, you rachet bitch!
SCOOTY
You ain’t shit, jit!
MOONEE
You are shit!
Jancey gets hit by a gob of spit.
JANCEY
Gramma, he spit on me.
MOONEE
(offended)
It wasn’t him, it was ME, stupid
THOT!
GRANDMA STACY
Hey! I’m coming up there and I am
fucking telling your parents!
Moonee/Scooty/Dicky get up and race down the walkway of the
second floor, the screaming back and forth persists.
MOONEE
Try it, bee-otch. I don’t even live
here!
Moonee/Scooty/Dicky LAUGH hysterically while running away.
Stacy fumes. Jancey and her little sister Luci stand by the
door, confused.
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Dicky race to the other side of FutureLand
and down the stairs. They run onto the parking lot.
GRANDMA STACY (O.S.)
Get the fuck back here!

4.
DICKY’S DAD (40’s) is sitting on a ratty lawn chair on the
second floor, he spots them racing away.
DICKY’S DAD
Hey! Dicky... not another step. Get
your ass over here. Now.
Dicky stops as Moonee and Scooty keep running. Grandma Stacy
yells up to Dicky’s Dad.
GRANDMA STACY
Are they your kids?
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DAY
Moonee and Scooty return to their home motel and run up the
stairs to the third floor.
WIDE on the two little kids as they walk down the entire
length of the motel toward the elevator/stairwell in the back
(this is the first big reveal of the geography of The Magic
Castle grounds).
They reach Moonee’s home -- Room 323.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Moonee slides the window open from the outside, sticks her
right arm in through the curtain and opens the door.
HALLEY (22) is in pajamas and lying on the bed, smoking and
watching “The Price is Right” on an old 19-inch tube
television.
Moonee and Scooty enter the room through the window, jump on
the bed and hop over Halley.
HALLEY
Hey, take your shoes off.
Their shoes come off as they grab all the pillows in sight to
make a fort.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Grandma Stacy, Jancey and Luci burst into the lobby. A tiredlooking AMBER (40’s, day clerk) looks up.
GRANDMA STACY
I want to speak with the manager
right now.

5.
AMBER
Can I help you with something?
GRANDMA STACY
Are you the manager?
AMBER
No, but I’m in charge of...
GRANDMA STACY
I want to speak with the manager
now.
AMBER
Can I ask what this is regarding?
GRANDMA STACY
Two little shits that live on this
property!
AMBER
(turns toward offscreen)
Bobby!
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
HARD KNOCKS on the door of room 323.
HALLEY
Yeah, what?
Moonee runs over to the door and opens it to reveal BOBBY
(50’s), the motel manager -- focused, overwhelmed and
cynical. He wears a wedding ring.
He stands with Grandma Stacy/Jancey/Luci. Shy little Jancey
stands behind her livid grandmother and peers inside. Moonee
immediately SLAMS THE DOOR in his face and walks back to the
bed.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Moonee? Who’s that?
Nobody.

MOONEE

HALLEY
Shit, Moonee. What did you two do?
Nothin’.

SCOOTY

6.
Halley gets up off the bed. She drops her cigarette in her
Mountain Dew can. Bobby begins speaking before the door
swings all the way back open.
BOBBY
This woman’s from next door. Says
Moonee did something to her car.
HALLEY
You in 322?
BOBBY
No, FutureLand.
Oh.

HALLEY

GRANDMA STACY
Her and her friend Scoot spit all
over my car and my kid here.
SCOOTY
(from under the bed)
It’s Scooty, not Scoot!
Halley almost laughs.
HALLEY
You saw them do this?
GRANDMA STACY
I did. Their friend’s father told
me that your kids are always
pulling this shit.
HALLEY
He ain’t my kid.
GRANDMA STACY
Well, those two, whoever those are.
HALLEY
(pointing at Moonee)
She’s mine.
GRANDMA STACY
I don’t give a shit. They spit on
my car and over my Jancey here.
BOBBY
Okay, Halley, one, sort this out.
Two, you smoke in the room again
and you’re outta here.

7.
HALLEY
I’m not smoking.
BOBBY
Last warning, Halley.
HALLEY
Yeah, well, I’m not.
Grandma Stacy watches Bobby walk off.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
C’mon, get some paper towels, you
two.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LAUNDRY AREA - DAY
Moonee/Scooty approach BERTHA (40’s) who is folding laundry.
BERTHA
Hola, Scooty y Moonee.
SCOOTY
Toalla de papel.
Por Favor!

MOONEE

Bertha grabs a roll of paper towels and hands it to Moonee.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
The entire party (Halley/Moonee, Scooty, Grandma
Stacy/Jancey/Luci) make their way over to FutureLand Inn.
HALLEY
These all yours?
GRANDMA STACY
These aren’t mine. Well, they’re
mine now. My daughter made me a
grandmother when she was 15. So I’m
looking after them until she stops
acting like her stupid father.
Halley offers Grandma Stacy a smoke. She accepts. Jancey is
quiet and stays close to her mother.
GRANDMA STACY (CONT’D)
(pointing to Jancey)
She was on methadone for the first
four weeks of her life.
(MORE)

8.
GRANDMA STACY (CONT’D)
(pointing to Luci)
Thank God, she had these two when
she was locked up.
HALLEY
When’d ya move in, Gramma?
Today.

GRANDMA STACY

HALLEY
Whatta they charging you a week?
$255.

GRANDMA STACY

HALLEY
You can get that shit down to $240.
Maybe even less knowing that
shithead who works the front desk
over there.
EXT./INT. FUTURELAND INN - DAY
Grandma Stacy smokes a cigarette as she and Halley watch
Moonee and Scooty wash the spit-covered car.
HALLEY
Got another one of those?
Grandma Stacy rolls her eyes as she gives Halley a cigarette.
As Moonee/Scooty clean the spit off the car, they both make
small talk with Jancey who watches curiously from the shadows
near her motel room.
MOONEE
What’s your name?
Jancey.

JANCEY

SCOOTY
What kind of a name is Jancey?!
MOONEE
Hey, Jancey? I’m Moonee. And hey...
Yeah?

JANCEY

9.
MOONEE
It sure would be a whole lot easier
if we had someone else to help us.
Scooty catches onto Moonee’s plan.
SCOOTY
It sure would.
MOONEE
What would happen if someone was
nice enough to volunteer?
SCOOTY
They would get an award and it
would say ‘the bestest ever!’
Jancey grabs a paper towel and goes over to help them.
GRANDMA STACY
HEY! Jancey, honey, what are you
doing?
JANCEY
I’m cleanin’ up!
GRANDMA STACY
No, sweetheart, that’s not your
job. It’s those two that have to
clean up!
Moonee winks at Jancey. Jancey smiles.
MOONEE
Aren’t you glad this happened
because now it’s cleaner than it
was before!
HALLEY
Oh let her fuckin’ help.
GRANDMA STACY
They’re having too much fun. This
is not supposed to be fun this is
supposed to be work. This is not
okay. Not okay at all.
HALLEY
Let them have a good time, it’s
kids being kids.
GRANDMA STACY
I think it was very disrespectful.
Not okay.

10.
MOONEE
Hey! We should clean that inside
too, it’s a giant MESS!
Scooty cheers.
HALLEY
You think they’re gonna get along
if they don’t socialize?
GRANDMA STACY
Oh just like you?
HALLEY
Yeah like me, what are you trying
to say? Look, you check them for
lice yet?
Lice?

GRANDMA STACY

HALLEY
Half the kids here have lice. I can
help you but you wanna be mean to
me. So fine. I know this shit.
The kids continue to playfully clean the old car.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - OUTSIDE ROOM 341 - DUSK
Halley and ten other RESIDENTS of The Magic Castle are
socializing, drinking and smoking on the balcony.
Halley is hanging with her best friend and Scooty's mom,
ASHLEY (23) on the stairs outside Room 341 where music is
blasting. Some of the rooms’ doors are open and some closed.
GLORIA (60’s) struts over.
GLORIA
Hey! Listen up, motherfuckers. You
have one of two choices. You can
all keep it down OR... you can get
a lady a beer.
Gloria sits down and joins the crowd and pops open a beer
which spills all over her.
ASHLEY
I’m off tomorrow. Want me to take
Moonee?

11.
HALLEY
No, it’s cool, we got our
appointment tomorrow. Now, what
would happen if we smoke the
fattest of blunts right now?
We hear Bobby off-screen.
BOBBY (O.S.)
Ladies and gentlemen, let’s wrap it
up. We have over twenty guests this
weekend and we’re already having
noise complaints.
A few residents can be heard protesting off-screen.
INT. SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY
HALLEY is seated with a CASE WORKER (female, 30’s). Moonee is
messing around with another LITTLE KID (4) while the adults
talk.
HALLEY
Most of those rachet-ass bitches
were doing extras... ya know, in
the back room.
(gives a handjob gesture)
I'm not doin’ extras. I'm fuckin’
dancing for tips. That’s what I do.
I said no... two days later with no
warning Hector fires me... after
not letting me up on stage all
fucking night. Fuckin’ bullshit.
CASE WORKER
Okay, well... this will affect your
TANF.
HALLEY
No shit. That’s why I’m here.
CASE WORKER
Okay, you need to make a concerted
effort to find at least thirty
hours.
HALLEY
(frustrated)
Yeah, well you find me thirty
hours! I have applications in at
every shithole up and down Irlo
Bronson and the parks ain’t going
to hire me.

12.
CASE WORKER
You can cover those up, Halley.
Halley is thrown off for a second. She then realizes the case
worker is referring to her tattoos.
HALLEY
No, my record. And now that it’s
summer and I got her during the
day... C’mon.
CASE WORKER
I get it. But you’ve got to give
benefits three job contacts a week
or you’ll be considered noncompliant.
(reading file)
And no child support.
Halley just shakes her head.
CASE WORKER (CONT’D)
When is he getting out?
Halley shakes her head again.
EXT. WAFFLE HOME / ORANGE WORLD - DAY
Moonee and Scooty sit in front of a “Welcome to Florida”
mural. They are nodding off. An off-screen WHISTLE wakes them
up.
Scooty’s mom Ashley stands in the front entrance of the fast
food waffle joint next door. She motions for them to go in
back.
As they run to the back, reveal that the two kids were
sitting on the side of the huge ORANGE WORLD dome right next
door.
EXT. WAFFLE HOME - BACK AREA - DAY
Scooty and Moonee wait out back. Ashley comes out with a
doggy bag.
MOONEE
Thanks, Miss Ashley. My mom wants
to know if you want to go to O.B.T.
tonight.
ASHLEY
It’s Saturday night, isn’t it?

13.
MOONEE
(to Scooty)
What was yesterday?
SCOOTY
Yesterday? That was... Friday.
MOONEE
(to Ashley)
Yes, today is Saturday.
ASHLEY
Okay, then we’re gonna go.
MOONEE
Okay, I’ll tell her. Bye, Miss
Ashley!
SCOOTY
Bye, Mommy!
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PLAYGROUND - DAY
Moonee/Scooty/Halley eat the Waffle Home food picnic-style in
a dilapidated playground next to the parking lot of the
motel.
A HELICOPTER loaded with TOURISTS lifts off next door. The
kids give it the finger as it lifts off for a tour.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORNER ROOM
Halley and Ashley are dressed up and ready to party. They
deliver Moonee and Scooty to a NEIGHBOR’s room.
HALLEY
Thanks again. Let me know if they
misbehave.
(to Moonee)
Behave, okay?
EXT. ORANGE BLOSSOM TRAIL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Halley and Ashley are in party mode. Latin food trucks,
tricked-out cars, smoke, blasting music. The two girls make
their way around, socialize, eat food and watch as the cars
drag race up and down the parking lot.
ASHLEY
This is the best burrito I’ve ever
eaten.

14.
We follow the girls docu-style as they socialize. They get
alone time as they eat their food.
ASHLEY (CONT’D)
They chose Simone.
HALLEY
Are you fuckin’ kidding me?
ASHLEY
I know. I been there way longer
than that bitch.
HALLEY
I can’t even believe it. Fuck that.
ASHLEY
The second I’m a manager you’re
totally hired, I mean it.
Halley’s night is ruined.
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - DAY
Moonee and Scooty approach Dicky’s room on the first floor of
FutureLand. Dicky’s Dad is lounging outside as usual.
MOONEE
Can Dicky come out and-DICKY’S DAD
Dicky’s being punished. He can’t
come out.
A MEAN CHIHUAHUA is staring at the kids. They walk away.
Moonee stops and turns back.
Wait.

MOONEE

EXT. FUTURELAND INN - DAY
Moonee and Scooty knock on Jancey’s door. Grandma Stacy
answers.
Yeah what?

GRANDMA STACY

MOONEE
Can Jancey come out and play?

15.
GRANDMA STACY
What? You gonna take her to spit on
someone else’s car?
MOONEE
No, we’re just playing.
GRANDMA STACY
What are you playing?
MOONEE
I dunno. Just playing.
GRANDMA STACY
Jance, those kids from the purple
place wanna know if you wanna play?
JANCEY
I wanna play.
GRANDMA STACY
No further than Magic Castle, okay?
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey run away.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - FRONT DRIVEWAY - DAY
Moonee/Scooty/Jancey walk past the front of Magic Castle
headed West.
JANCEY
Don’t you live there?
MOONEE
Yeah but we have things to show
you.
JANCEY
My grandma said no further than
here.
MOONEE
Well we need ice cream. And this is
a tour. Follow us. It’s okay.
Jancey hesitates, then makes a decision to take her first
step into uncharted territory.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - WIZARD GIFT SHOP - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey walk by a gift shop on Route 192
that has a large Wizard sculpture over it.

16.
JANCEY
You think we’re going too far?
MOONEE
Just come on!
Jancey stops and looks up at the giant wizard, entranced.
After a beat, she moves on.
SCOOTY
That’s Wizzy. He’ll protect us.
It’s safe.
MOONEE
Yeah, Wizzy’s a protector! Come on!
Jancey continues to follow her two new friends.
EXT. ABANDONED CASTLE - DAY
They walk by a boarded-up old castle attraction.
MOONEE
That’s an old castle. Many battles
must’ve happened there once.
EXT. THRIFT STORE - DAY
The three kids walk past a thrift store. Jancey looks ahead
and smiles.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - TWISTEE TREAT - DAY
They approach a structure that looks like a giant ice cream
cone alongside the highway.
MOONEE
And THIS is where you get free ice
cream.
Really?

JANCEY

EXT. ROUTE 192 - TWISTEE TREAT - DAY - LATER
The three kids beg for change from a TOURIST MOTHER AND
DAUGHTER.

17.
MOONEE
Excuse me, Miss? Would you be so
kind as to give us your change so
we can have cones too?
SCOOTY
Hopefully one day we can make
enough money and then pay you back.
The mother fishes for some change in her purse.
SCOOTY (CONT’D)
The doctor said we gotta eat ice
cream right away.
MOONEE
Yeah, we have cancer and need ice
cream.
Jancey is in awe of the con job taking place before her eyes.
EXT. MEDICAL CENTER CLINIC - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey walk by a group of HOMELESS living
in boxes outside a boarded-up Medical Center.
MOONEE
Here is where the homeless people
live.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey share a cone as they approach the
Magic Castle. Moonee pops the last bite in her mouth, then
stops herself. Moonee passes the last piece to Jancey.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 2ND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY
Moonee and Scooty continue to give Jancey their tour into the
grounds of The Magic Castle. They stop and point at every
door. The sequence will play as if we are condensing a
documented tour with jump cuts between every line of
dialogue.
SCOOTY
216 is Abigahil. She’s a nice woman
with lots of pillows. And sells
drugs sometimes.

18.
MOONEE
And 217 is a family that has a
brother who stabbed someone on
Valentine’s Day.
The kids pass the elevator.
MOONEE (CONT’D)
And nobody ever uses the elevator
cause it smells like pee.
The kids round a corner.
SCOOTY
And 222 is a family that fights
like all day.
MOONEE
And the woman who lives in here
thinks she’s married to Jesus.
They approach the laundry room. Bertha is exiting the utility
room and enters the laundry room.
SCOOTY
And that’s Bertha. She smokes
weeds.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - OFFICE - DAY
Bobby is at his computer when the power goes off. The lights,
monitors and the hum of the air conditioning cut out.
BOBBY
Aw... shit.
AMBER (O.S.)
‘The shit just happened?
Bobby sits in the dark.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
The electricity is shut off across entire motel.
Bobby exits the lobby door. He’s pissed.
WIDE SHOT, LONG TAKE of the entire East wing of the motel.
This allows us to see many of the motel’s residents filtering
out of their rooms in anger. (Gloria, RICO the Pool Guy,
CUBBY, Haley, Ashley + Troy + 30 BACKGROUND)

19.
Bobby continues to walk rapidly toward the back of the
building trying to defuse the situation. We see Moonee,
Scooty and Jancey hastily enter room 323.
We hold on the complaining residents. A few take the
opportunity to chill out and light up.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - UTILITY ROOM - DAY
Bobby enters the small room and sees a thrown switch. He
flips it back on.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
The electricity goes back on and Bobby makes his way back
outside as the residents CHEER.
Bobby waves to the residents, triumphantly.
BOBBY
Drama’s over. You can all go back
to your rooms now, folks. Have a
nice day.
People filter back inside the rooms.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Amber is behind the counter trying to calm down THREE ANNOYED
RESIDENTS, one of them is Gloria.
GLORIA
Totally unacceptable! I pay good
fuckin’ money for my room and that
includes A.C.-- ya know what I mean
by A.C.? A Cunt. As in you are a
cunt!
Bobby enters the lobby. He’s pissed. He beelines to the back
office.
AMBER
Bound to happen at least once this
summer. Everyone’s blasting their
AC. Then you got microwaves, hot
plates... fucking crock pots. These
rooms weren’t designed to be
extended stay suites.

20.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - BACK OFFICE - DAY
Bobby is reviewing the CCTV as we hear Amber continuing to
try to calm down the residents. He squints at one of the
camera feeds.
Amber?

BOBBY

Amber enters the office.
Yeah?

AMBER

BOBBY
Wasn’t crock pots.
He points to the CCTV monitor. On one of the feeds is an
image of Bertha leaving the utility room... and in come three
little bodies entering and pulling the switch.
Of course.

AMBER

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Bobby exits the lobby, fast. He walks up the stairs and
pauses at Bertha pushing her cart on the walkway.
BOBBY
Bertha, you leave that utility room
unlocked again and you’re gone. And
don’t think I don’t know what
you’re doing in there.
Bobby makes a “smoking weed” gesture.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
None of that on the premises,
comprende?
He continues to the third floor.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
Halley is sitting on the bed smoking a blunt. Huddled next to
her are Moonee, Scooty and Jancey. They are playing a game on
the iPad.
A LOUD KNOCK at the door. The kids look at each other.

21.

Yeah?

HALLEY

BOBBY
Halley. Open the door.
Halley looks over at the three kids. They look guilty.
HALLEY
(even-keeled)
Fuckin’ A. What did you do now?
She snubs out the blunt and grabs a can of air freshener and
blasts the air.
BOBBY (O.S.)
Halley, open up, now.
Halley gets off the bed and approaches the door, pissed.
MOONEE
(whispering to Jancey)
Don’t act guilty.
Halley opens the door.
Yeah?

HALLEY

BOBBY
I have a video of the kids
illegally entering the utilities
closet and pulling the power.
JANCEY
They told me that I could be part
of the club if I did it.
Halley laughs -- causing Moonee and Scooty to laugh.
HALLEY
That’s lit.
BOBBY
Funny right? Happens again and
you’re gone. Second week of summer
and there’s already been a dead
fish in the pool-MOONEE
It was an experiment. We were
trying to bring it back to life!

22.
BOBBY
...and water balloons at some
tourists. You don’t mess with
tourists.
SCOOTY
They didn’t tip us!
MOONEE
Damn non-tippers!
HALLEY
(turns to Bobby)
Oh God. Are you serious?
BOBBY
Quite serious.
HALLEY
My God. This is unacceptable.
Bobby realizes she is being facetious.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
I’ve failed as a mother. Moonee,
you’ve disgraced me!
Halley bursts into a laughing fit that causes Moonee, Scooty
and Jancey to join in with giggles.
BOBBY
Don’t fuck with me right now,
Halley.
HALLEY
Kids having fun. C’mon bro.
BOBBY
Yeah, so, I lost three hours of
work. Work. You know what that is?
Halley laughs.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
And I’m talking to Ashley, by the
way. If your friend leaves you in
charge of her kid, he becomes your
responsibility and you ain’t taking
responsibility. And this one, isn’t
she from FutureLand?
HALLEY
Oh whatevs. You gotta relax, man.

23.
BOBBY
You gonna redo my expense reports
with your whatevs? Your kid just
killed my night. I wanted to watch
the game. You gonna pay me for the
three hours I gotta work later?
HALLEY
Hey guys, pay the man for his three
hours.
MOONEE
I don’t have any money.
SCOOTY
I don’t have any money.
JANCEY
I have fourteen cents.
HALLEY
We only has fourteen cents. You’re
shit outta luck.
BOBBY
Speaking of... I haven’t gotten
this week’s rent from you.
HALLEY
You don’t think I know that.
She closes the door. Bobby stands outside their door and does
breathing exercises to calm down.
JANCEY
I think I want to go home now.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - 2ND FLOOR MISCELLANEOUS ROOM - DAY
Bobby and JACK (28) are wrapping a mattress in plastic.
JACK
Well, the purple looks nice. How
much did that put you all back?
BOBBY
Narek spent 20K on it.
JACK
And he can’t afford an
exterminator?

24.

Here.

BOBBY

Bobby hands Jack duct tape. Jack rips a strip and seals the
plastic. Bobby stops him.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
No, Jack, I told you! Longer
strips.
JACK
Then you do it.
BOBBY
I was just saying, you know better,
you have to use longer strips.
C’mon.
They continue to seal the mattress. Jack is focused on the
job and barely notices Moonee and Scooty as they peer in.
MOONEE
Whatcha doin?
BOBBY
Top secret work.
Really?

SCOOTY

BOBBY
Guys, I need you outta here.
MOONEE
You guys are boring anyway.
BOBBY
That’s right. See you later.
The kids run off. Bobby and Jack continues to work in
silence. Eventually Bobby begins removing the headboard.
Jesus.

JACK

BOBBY
Oh, worse than I thought.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUMPSTER - DAY
Bobby and Jack throw the sealed mattress in the dumpster. No
words are spoken between them.

25.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY
Moonee and Scooty sit in the lobby licking dripping ice cream
cones. Their faces are covered with melted ice cream.
We reveal that Bobby has been watching them intently. Arms
crossed, leaning against the counter.
Scooty's melting cone breaks apart and a piece hits the
floor.
BOBBY
Okay, out! I warned you. One drop
and you’re out. Now out.
MOONEE
Oh come on!
SCOOTY
It’s gonna melt outside!
BOBBY
Obviously it’s melting inside too.
The two kids exit the lobby.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ENCLAVE - DAY
Moonee and Scooty lounge in the enclave, remnants of ice
cream all over their faces. Something grabs Scooty's
attention...
Gloria!

SCOOTY

Gloria is strutting towards the pool with a towel in a
bikini.
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - JANCEY’S ROOM - DAY
Moonee/Scooty pound on Jancey’s door, winded and panicking.
Dicky has joined the group. Grandma Stacy answers.
GRANDMA STACY
Hey, one light knock will do.
MOONEE AND SCOOTY
We need Jancey!!!

26.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - POOL AREA + BATTLEMENT - DAY
Moonee/Scooty/Jancey/Dicky run onto the second floor balcony
and perch over the castle battlement to look down at the pool
area -Gloria sunbathes topless. The kids giggle as they spy on her
chanting “Boobies, boobies, boobies!”
Bobby eventually saunters into the pool area.
BOBBY
Gloria, cover it up, please. I’ve
told you this before. Thank you.
Gloria resists.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
These kids don’t need a health
class right now.
GLORIA
Kids are in school, honey.
BOBBY
They’re right there.
(pointing)
It’s summer break, Gloria.
GLORIA
Are you kidding me?
She stands up, revealing her chest in all its glory.
GLORIA (CONT’D)
You gonna stand there and give me
shit about these? Are these making
you uncomfortable, Bobby?
BOBBY
Cover it up. Thank you.
The kids laugh and chant while Gloria continues to protest.
Finally Gloria covers up. The kids are upset.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK
On the driveway of The Magic Castle, Jancey and Dicky are
walking home. Moonee and Scooty slip into the lobby.
DICKY
I better get home before I get
grounded again.

27.
PATRICE (30’s), the Magic Castle night manager, rolls up and
steps out of his BEAT-UP CAR.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DUSK - CONTINUOUS
Patrice enters, nods to Bobby. Moonee and Scooty are
whistling into a fan.
SCOOTY
I can’t whistle.
Scooty makes an annoying sound into the fan.
Kids. Out.

PATRICE

Patrice passes Amber wrapping things up behind the desk.
Amber begins packing up and getting ready to go.
Yep.
Yeah.

PATRICE (CONT’D)
AMBER

Bobby is sitting at the desk, tending to emails. He never
looks away from the screen.
Hey, boss.

PATRICE

BOBBY
Narek will be in next week so we
just need to take care of the
invoices tonight, oh and do me a
favor, put in that paint order,

AMBER
And that effing ice machine has
been out of order for three months.
MOONEE
Yeah, fix that effing ice machine!
SCOOTY
We need ice! People need ice.
BOBBY
That thing can’t be fixed. I’ll
deal with it.
(to Patrice)
(MORE)

28.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Just talk to him about the reorder. Thank you. Oh, and keep your
eyes on 151. There’s been traffic
in and out all day.
Patrice studies Bobby for a moment.
PATRICE
Are you... Bobby, that room’s been
hot all week. I thought you were
letting ‘em slide?
Patrice lights his candle. Bobby just stares. He rubs his
face.
BOBBY
I’ll take care of it tomorrow.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK
Bobby leaves the lobby... he walks three steps and enters the
closest motel room to the office -- Room 101. He slams the
door to his home.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DUSK
Amber leaves.
AMBER
Have a great fucking night.
Patrice settles behind the counter.
PATRICE
What did I say? Get outta here!
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Halley, Ashley, Moonee and Scooty sit on the stairs. Moonee
plays a game on the iPad while Halley and Ashley listen to
hip-hop on their phone.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAWN
Outside Room 151, Bobby is watching a couple packing up and
leaving.
DEALER GIRL
This is fucked up, son.

29.
BOBBY
Don’t want to hear it. Let’s go.
DEALER GIRL
I paid for the week, man. I want a
refund.
BOBBY
Get the fuck outta here.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT
Moonee and Scooty sit on the steps of the front stairwell
near the lobby. They are lit by the sodium-vapour lamps that
illuminate the parking lot. In the background, residents of
the motel are out on their balconies socializing.
A TAXI pulls into the parking lot. Moonee/Scooty perk up.
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Patrice takes the candle out of his bag and searches for a
lighter.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT
The cab parks under the awning outside the lobby. A CABBIE
(50), shocked HUBBY (40) and confused WIFE (30) exit the car.
HUBBY
Wait, hold on, Sir. I think you got
the wrong place.
CABBIE
This is the address you gave me.
WIFE
(Portuguese)
What did he say?
The driver removes luggage from the back of the taxi.
HUBBY
Wait, I think we have a problem
here. This isn’t where we are
staying.
Moonee and Scooty approach. The wife looks at them.

30.
CABBIE
Well, you want to check that
address?
WIFE
(Portuguese)
We are going to the Magic
Kingdom... you said you booked a
hotel at the Magic Kingdom. That
everything was taken care of. What
is this place? We are not even on
Disney property.
HUBBY
(Portuguese)
Shit. I mean... Joao booked it for
me. I don’t know.
WIFE
(Portuguese)
You had your assistant book our
honeymoon hotel? Are you fucking
kidding me?
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - NIGHT
CUT TO a conversation already in progress between our Hubby
and Patrice. The Husband has his phone to his ear. Moonee and
Scooty are watching. The Cabbie is smoking a cigarette
outside.
PATRICE
(into walkie talkie)
Bobby, can you help me out in here?
Patrice turns back to the husband.
PATRICE (CONT’D)
I can give you the AAA rate, how
about that?
HUBBY
No. No no, I am not asking for a
discount.
PATRICE
Well I’ve already said, because you
booked it online, if you want a
refund you have to do it online,
you’ll get it back on your
statement within 2-3 weeks.
The husband hangs up the phone and turns to his wife.

31.
HUBBY
(Portuguese)
He’s not answering.
(to Patrice in English)
No, you don’t understand. I don’t
care about a refund. We just need a
place to stay.
PATRICE
And you got a place to stay. You
have room 325.
MOONEE
That’s two rooms down from my room!
Bobby enters the lobby.
BOBBY
What’s up?
(to kids)
You two. Out.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT
The cabbie impatiently smokes his cigarette. The kids stare
through the window.
SCOOTY
That lady is pretty.
MOONEE
Yeah. But... I think she’s going to
cry. I can always tell when adults
are about to cry.
The cabbie opens the door of the lobby.
CABBIE
Hey man. I’m going to have to
charge you waiting time. I got
other calls.
WIFE
(Portuguese)
What is he saying?
The husband is overwhelmed.
HUBBY
Wait, Sir. I’ll get the new
address. Hold on.

32.
CABBIE
Hey, look, just call the company
when you’re ready, it’s a busy
weekend for us. I’m losing fares.
The cabbie snubs the cigarette and enters the lobby. We see
that he is settling the bill with the husband as the kids
watch through the glass.
Moonee eyes the luggage and then looks to Scooty. He nods and
winks. The two kids grab the couple’s luggage and move it
into the lobby.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - NIGHT
The cabbie exits and drives away. The husband is busy on his
phone, scouring the internet.
BOBBY
It’s almost midnight, one of the
busiest weekends of the year around
here. The only other room you’ll
find tonight is another single
somewhere along this stretch. Take
your pick.
HUBBY
Listen, do you see my wife there?
She’s Brazilian. They LOVE this
place. She’s been coming here since
she was a kid and her dream was to
have her honeymoon in Disney.
MOONEE
You just got married?
Wife notices kids have taken the luggage inside.
BOBBY
Listen, trust me. If I brought my
girl to this place on our
honeymoon, she would have divorced
my ass. I feel for you. But what do
you want me to do, fella?
WIFE
(very broken English)
Hey! Get away from that!
PATRICE
They’re just trying to get a tip.

33.
MOONEE
You can’t leave stuff out there.
SCOOTY
Yeah, there’s punks out there.
WIFE
(Portuguese)
What are these stray children
rummaging about? This is a welfare,
slum motel. We’re spending our
honeymoon in a gypsy project? Find
another place. Check The Polynesian
first. Or Grand Floridian. Maybe
The Contemporary but only Bay Lake
Tower!
HUBBY
(Portuguese)
I’m checking, okay? This is their
independence holiday. Very popular.
The resorts are booked.
The wife begins to cry. Moonee looks over at Scooty.
Told ya.

MOONEE

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ENCLAVE - DAY
Moonee and Scooty sit in their favorite spot once again.
SCOOTY
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
Of course!

MOONEE

SCOOTY
Make sure you don’t tell anyone.
Scooty whips out a lighter he took from Patrice.
SCOOTY (CONT’D)
It has a naked lady on it!
Moonee gasps! Halley yells down from upstairs.
Moonee!

HALLEY (O.S.)

MOONEE
What, Mom!?!

34.
HALLEY (O.S.)
Get off your butts and go get some
waffles!
EXT. WAFFLE HOME - DAY
Moonee/Scooty pick up food from the back of Waffle Home. As
Ashley hands Scooty a doggy bag, she notices how filthy the
two kids are.
ASHLEY
You have shit all over your face,
get over here.
She proceeds to wipe off both of their faces with her apron.
MOONEE
Oh, my mom wanted extra maple
syrup.
Moonee smiles as Ashley loads up the bag. Moonee whispers in
Scooty’s ear.
MOONEE (CONT’D)
It’s actually for me.
Scooty joins her in a giggle.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PLAYGROUND - DAY
Moonee/Scooty/Halley once again eat their food picnic-style.
Moonee drowns her waffle with the extra syrup.
Silent eating. Wind blows through their hair. Halley is
focused on her smartphone.
INT. ROUTE 192 PERFUME WHOLESALERS - DAY
Halley haggles with a PERFUME WHOLESALER while Moonee tries
out samples.
HALLEY
Can I get a discount if I buy over
twenty?
PERFUME WHOLESALER
Umm... this is wholesale.
Halley pays cash and leaves with a bag full of sealed boxes
of perfume.

35.
EXT. FANCY HOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY
Halley and Moonee attempt to sell perfume to HOTEL GUESTS.
Moonee puts on her best “cute face.”
(Shot “candid camera”-style with a hidden camera. Actors will
attempt to sell perfume to real pedestrians.)
HALEY
Excuse me. We are selling perfume.
Would you like to help my daughter
and I and buy a bottle? They smell
great.
MOONEE
These will make you smell like
Justin Bieber!
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Bobby is behind the counter with Amber. Magic Castle Owner
NAREK (50’s) is reading reviews on his phone.
NAREK
...what does “rachet” even mean?
Listen, Amber, you need to tell
everybody you know, I need better
Yelp reviews. Not just Yelp.
Expedia, Priceline, all those. I
need five-star reviews. This is
killing me.
AMBER
Why don’t you offer the residents
like a discount to give a good
review.
NAREK
That’s not a bad idea. I like that.
Something catches Bobby’s eye. He looks up. It’s Halley,
headed straight for the office. “What shitstorm will this be
now” is written all over Bobby’s face.
Halley enters and marches up to the counter.
HALLEY
Oh, sorry to interrupt. I just
wanted to pay you for the week,
Sir. $240.
Halley plops down two hundreds and two twenties.

36.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Our stay has been delightful so
far. The pool temperature is
perfection. Have a great day.
Halley exits. Amber counts the cash.
NAREK
Did you see these fake reviews The
Wishing Star has? That woman was
murdered there last month. No way
anyone in their right mind is
giving that shithole four stars.
AMBER
I kinda miss counting $240 in
singles.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Narek and Bobby walk and talk, passing RESIDENTS and CURIOUS
KIDS. Moonee, Scooty and Jancey watch the adults from the
stairs. Scooty is playing with the lighter. Narek points up
to the bikes locked onto the railings on the second and third
floors.
NAREK
Okay, see? That’s finable now. Make
a flyer. Put it under the doors. It
should say they have to remove the
bikes and lock ‘em in the back. If
there are any bikes remaining on
the rails we’re going to cut them
on August first. Got it?
Yes.

BOBBY

Watching from overhead, Moonee let’s out a sigh.
EXT. FUTURELAND INN - PARKING LOT - DAY
Moonee/Scooty/Jancey and other kids watch as Dicky and his
Dad move out. Their old station wagon is packed to the brim.
Dicky’s Dad throws some stuff in to the dumpster and gives
toys away to Moonee, Jancey, Scooty and the rest.
DICKY’S DAD
Dicky, wanna say bye to your room?
Dicky shakes his head, he doesn’t look happy that his 99-centstore knock-off Woody and Buzz toys are being given away.

37.
DICKY’S DAD (CONT’D)
I told you, New Orleans, new toys.
There’s not an extra inch in this
thing. Let’s get rolling.
Dicky walks over to his friends.
MOONEE
My mom says to say good-bye.
DICKY
Well, see ya around, I guess.
The kids hug and fist-bump him good-bye. Moonee seems
indifferent. She’s been through this before. Never good to
get too emotional over anyone. Like her mom taught her.
Dicky’s father gives the kids a cardboard box of remaining
toys and bric-a-brac.
The kids wave and watch as the car leaves the driveway.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - TWISTEE TREAT - DAY
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey split an ice cream outside the
Twistee Treat. Moonee holds the cone and passes it to her
friends.
MOONEE
One lick for you... (to Jancey) one
lick for you... (to Scooty)and one
lick for me... (Moonee licks again)
two licks for you... (to Jancey)...
two licks for you... (to Scooty)
and one, two licks for me (Moonee
licks twice).
TWISTEE TREAT EMPLOYEE
Hey. Hey! You guys can’t hang out
there. Seriously. You can’t sit
there.
The kids don’t move an inch.
SCOOTY
We’re paying customers!
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - NIGHT
Halley is wearing a bathing suit. She grabs a towel and
passes by the sleeping Moonee. She exits.

38.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT
Halley and Ashley are in the pool. They smoke and drink and
laugh. They converse about the kids and their single status.
Bobby is making his nightly rounds.
BOBBY
Girls, you know very well that
night swimming is a no-go.
HALLEY
Did you just say no-go?
The women laugh.
ASHLEY
Wanna go skinny dipping, Bobby?
Bobby gives up and continues on his patrol.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - OUTSIDE HALLEY AND ASHLEY ROOMS - NIGHT
The two women return to their respective rooms.
ASHLEY
Good night, bitch. I love you.

Halley and Moonee eat a cheese pizza on the bed.
MOONEE
Where’s the iPad?
Sold.
What?

HALLEY
MOONEE

39.
HALLEY
Had to sell it.
But why?

MOONEE

HALLEY
Whatever, Moonee. This room costs
money.
Moonee is disappointed.
MOONEE
You know I like pepperoni.
HALLEY
Pepperoni costs money.
The two sit in silence while watching the TV. Halley sideeyes her daughter. She knows the Moonee is upset.
Halley gets off the bed and grabs a bag of gummy bears.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
But look...
She sprinkles gummy bears onto the pie.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
We got gummy bear pizza!
Moonee loves it.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Halley pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to Bobby.
BOBBY
Seriously, if you’re going to be
late again, you got to let me know.
HALLEY
It was due yesterday.
BOBBY
Yeah, exactly, it was due
yesterday.
Whatevs.

HALLEY

Bobby counts the cash. Halley exits.

40.
EXT. ABANDONED CONDOS - DAY
A quarter of a mile up Route 192 is a fenced-off set of
pastel-colored condos, weather-damaged and abandoned.
Moonee, Scooty and Jancey ignore the “Private Property: Do
Not Enter” sign. Jancey looks concerned.
MOONEE
C’mon. This is gonna be a haunted
scary adventure.
SCOOTY
Yeah, there’s ghosts in there.
Ghosts?!

JANCEY

They run around the exteriors of the dilapidated condos.
SCOOTY
And there are killer gators in
there that chase pirates!
Scooty points to the water as Jancey moves away from it.
They enter the condos.
INT. ABANDONED CONDOS - DAY
Peeling paint, water damage, collapsed ceilings and floors...
all results of the hurricane back in ‘08.
Scooty jumps out and tries to scare the girls, pretending to
be a ghost of these “haunted” buildings.
MOONEE
Someday we’ll live in a place this
big.
JANCEY
Can I come over and play?
MOONEE
Of course, Jancey! And this is
where my bed will be.
Moonee points to different sections of the empty space.
MOONEE (CONT’D)
No, I’ll put my bed there and
that’s where my toys will go there.

41.
Scooty runs off to another room and has fun breaking some
windows, throwing debris from the second floor, etc.
Moonee and Jancey break away from Scooty. Moonee approaches a
fireplace filled with debris.
JANCEY
I never lived in a house that had a
fireplace.
MOONEE
Well, you do now! Wait! I got the
bestest idea!
You do?

JANCEY

MOONEE
Scooty! We need your lighter!
INT. ABANDONED CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Moonee and Jancey watch as Scooty gets his lighter to spark.
EXT. ROUTE 192 FUTURELAND LAWN - DAY
Moonee, Jancey and Scooty run down the side of Route 192 onto
the lawn of FutureLand.
SCOOTY
We’re in so much trouble!
MOONEE
No, it’ll be okay. We just have to
pretend we weren’t there!
Jancey veers off and Moonee/Scooty keep running.
MOONEE (CONT’D)
(yelling to Jancey)
Don’t-tell-anyone-Jancey-okay-seeya-just-go-home-no-one-say-a-wordokay-later-k-bye!
JANCEY
(screaming)
Okay!
Hurry!

SCOOTY

42.

OKAYYYYY!

MOONEE

JANCEY
OKAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DAY
Moonee and Scooty run down the balcony to their respective
rooms as residents exit their rooms and look to the sky.
Someone calls 9-1-1, some panic, some are excited but
everyone rushes to the scene.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Amber peeks around the corner of the back office.
AMBER
Yo, I need help out here.
Bobby exits the back office.
BOBBY
What’s going on?
A family of three is checking in: NEW GIRL (11), NEW BOY (7)
and NEW FATHER (35) are standing in front of the counter. New
Father is deaf and being assisted by his daughter. Amber
motions to the guest registration sheet.
AMBER
I can’t explain it any better than
I already have. The address thing.
NEW GIRL
My father doesn’t understand what
he did wrong.
BOBBY
Let me see. Oh, yeah. No problem.
Just initial here. States that the
address on your ID is your
permanent address.
New Girl and New Boy turn to the father and translate in sign
language. He speaks back to them in sign language.
NEW GIRL
He says he told her that that’s our
old address.

43.
BOBBY
Yes, so, is there a new permanent
address?
The kids turn and translate. The father replies.
NEW GIRL
He says he wouldn’t be moving his
family into a motel if we had a
permanent address.
BOBBY
Tell him I’m trying to help him
here. Legally I can’t rent a room
if you’re homeless.
NEW GIRL
Well, we’re not homeless.
Bobby raises his eyebrows.
BOBBY
And that’s exactly what my boss
wants to hear... so writing down a
permanent address will help with
that. Got me?
Again, the kids translate. All the while, residents are
running by the lobby windows. It’s distracting to Bobby.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Excuse me a second.
Bobby walks to the doors as Amber takes over the check-in.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Perplexed, Bobby steps out of the lobby to watch the excited
residents running toward Route 192. He notices a huge cloud
of black smoke in the distance.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 223 - DAY
The door is open and Ashley watches the residents leave the
parking lot. She is excited about seeing the fire.
ASHLEY
C’mon, Scooty... don’t you wanna
see the burning house?

44.
SCOOTY
No, it’s okay. I’m just going to
watch TV.
She knows something is wrong.
ASHLEY
Scooty. Please tell me you didn’t
have anything to do with this?
SCOOTY
No. I didn’t.
ASHLEY
Scooty. Don’t fuck with me right
now. If you did this, I’m in so
much trouble.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 2ND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY
We see Halley and Moonee at the end of the walkway.
HALLEY
Hurry your ass, bitch. I don’t want
to miss this.
Ashley leans out of her door.
ASHLEY
I’ll meet you there.
HALLEY
Okay, hurry, bitch!
Halley and Moonee take off.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 223 - DAY
ASHLEY
You tell me the truth right now.
You understand what will happen to
us if you did this? You want the
fuckin’ DCF down here, Scooty?!
Ashley is starting to lose it, scaring Scooty.
SCOOTY
I didn’t do it. Moonee and Jancey
did it.
Ashley gets in Scooty’s face.

45.
ASHLEY
And how do you know that? Were you
there, Scooty?
EXT./INT. ABANDONED CONDOS - DUSK
The excited CROWD watches as FIREFIGHTERS attempt to put out
the inferno. A crowd of ONLOOKERS are pumped and very vocal.
Halley is offered a beer by some guys. She accepts. Fun all
around.
The fire is put out against the purple dusk sky.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK
Gloria is smoking outside the front lobby as Bobby walks by.
BOBBY
You got another one of those?
GLORIA
For you? Why not.
Bobby lights up. Bobby sits down as Gloria stares at the
remaining smoke fading into the red sky.
GLORIA (CONT’D)
Could’ve been arson.
Bobby shrugs, looks down.
GLORIA (CONT’D)
They were so fucking ugly I was
thinking of burning them down!
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - BACK BALCONY - DAY
MOONEE
Nobody said anything right?
Jancey and Scooty confirm.
MOONEE (CONT’D)
Okay, good. Manhunt!
Moonee, Jancey and Scooty play Hide & Seek. Scooty begins
counting as the girls run away.

46.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BACK OFFICE - DAY
Moonee and Jancey run into the office and hide under the
desk. They are forced to be very close to one another... and
to Bobby’s feet.
MOONEE
Even though you have your boots
laced up, I can still smell your
stinky feet. They smell, right?
Jancey giggles. Bobby rolls his eyes.
BOBBY
These stinky feet are going to kick
you in the face if you don’t shut
up. And please go outside.
Jancey starts to get up. Moonee stops her.
MOONEE
We’re hiding. This is serious.
JANCEY
Bobby, you should probably buy some
Dr. Scholls or talcum powder.
Scooty runs in.
SCOOTY
(to Amber)
You see Moonee and Jancey?
Amber points to the back office. Scooty runs to the back.
Bobby points to under the desk.
MOONEE
(to Bobby)
Oh man! C’mon!
SCOOTY
(to Bobby and Amber)
You guys aren’t supposed to tell
me!
BOBBY
(doesn’t care)
G’bye.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - FRONT STAIRS
Jancey is counting on the bottom of the front stairs.
Scooty and Moonee run up the stairs to hide and run into
livid Ashley. Ashley grabs Scooty and drags him away.

47.
ASHLEY
You think I was joking? I told you,
you ain’t playing with those two
anymore.
Moonee is perplexed.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Huge BRAWL with 5 BRAWLERS and 10 BRAWL WATCHERS in the
middle of the parking lot.
Moonee watches from the 3rd floor balcony with Halley.
Halley, smoking a blunt, CHEERS ON the violence. She looks
down to the second floor balcony and sees Ashley watching.
HALLEY
Yo, Ash, you believe this shit!?
Ashley looks up, acknowledges, does not answer.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Bitch, what’s good?
Ashley has retreated to her room.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
‘Fucks wrong with her?
A car SPINS OUT and RUNS OVER one of the brawlers. The crowd
goes crazy.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - LATER
Bobby, in boxers and a T-shirt, stands outside room 101
watching the car fly by. He calls 911.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - OUTSIDE LOBBY - NIGHT
Flashing police lights illuminate the interior. 4 POLICE
OFFICERS are standing outside the office asking questions of
residents.
A previously-seen resident is complaining to an officer that
they should have left the kids alone and let the fight
continue. Bobby and Patrice watch on.
PATRICE
What was I supposed to do?

48.
BOBBY
No more checking in parties larger
than five unless it’s a family. No
more open containers of alcohol
outside the rooms. No more kids
hanging up in the stairwell. And
how ‘bout this? How ‘bout no more
letting people run over other
people in the fucking parking lot?
How ‘bout that?
PATRICE
I couldn’t do anything, Room 217
joined in before I even got out!
The kids are fascinated with the officers.
EXT. FANCY HOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY
Continuation of the “candid camera” style. Halley and Moonee
attempt to sell more perfume to pedestrians. Moonee sells
just as hard as her mother.
After one too many rejections, Halley asks a GOLFER if he
could spare a couple of bucks. The man hands over a few
singles.
Halley is distracted from a perfume sale, she turns to see a
SECURITY GUARD approaching in a gold cart. She grabs Moonee
and begins to walk swiftly out of the parking lot.
SECURITY GUARD
Hey! Come back!
HALLEY
It’s fine. We’re leaving.
SECURITY GUARD
I need you to come with me.
Halley speeds up the pace, pulling Moonee.
SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
You hear me? You were soliciting.
HALLEY
You’re not a real cop.
SECURITY GUARD
You can’t do that on our property.
Police are on the way and I need to
confiscate that.

49.
A tug of war over the bag of perfume ends in the entire bag
exploding onto the pavement.
HALLEY
Fuck! You fucking bitch!
Halley grabs Moonee and drags her away.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
Halley is stressed, but then attempts to keep the mood fun by
having Moonee hop on her back. Halley attempts to suppress
tears as she walks Moonee back toward Magic Castle.
MOONEE
Why did we let her have our
perfume?
HALLEY
It’s complicated, baby.
But why?

MOONEE

HALLEY
Just c’mon.
MOONEE
But we just left all our stuff
there?
HALLEY
I can’t get arrested again, Moonee!
Now come on!

Ashley opens the back door.
ASHLEY
Moonee, tell your mom, I can’t be
giving away food, okay?

Oh, okay, well, is Scooty here?
Nope.

MOONEE
Oh... he’s not at home.
ASHLEY
He’s at my friend’s.
MOONEE
Oh. Well, it’s Jancey’s birthday
and we wanted to know if Scooty-ASHLEY
You can’t come around here no more,
okay? I don’t want you playing with
Scooty anymore, got it?
Moonee leaves, confused.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DUSK
Haley, Moonee and Jancey walking down Magic Castle driveway.
HALEY
You sure Scooty don’t want to come?

That’s what Ashley said.
HALEY
Ashley said what?
MOONEE
That they’re not coming.
EXT. ROUTE 192 – OSCEOLA COUNTY SIGN – MAGIC HOUR
Halley is hitchhiking. Moonee and Jancey stand next to her.
Jancey seems a bit confused why they’re on the side of the
road so close to oncoming traffic.
INT. CAR - MAGIC HOUR - TRAVELING (MOVING INTO NIGHT)
The DRIVER, a clean-cut man in his upper 20’s who is clearly
on his way to work at Magic Kingdom looks in his rear view
mirror, having second thoughts if picking up these three was
a good idea.

51.
Halley leans over and changes the radio from a local station
playing a 1982 EPCOT Center instrumental track to a rap
station. Halley is very excited to hear “BOSS ASS BITCH”.
Halley begins to rap along with it. Moonee joins in.
Eventually, Jancey joins as well on the most explicit lyric.
HALLEY
Okay right up here is good.
INT. CAR / EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - NIGHT (TRAVELING)
DRIVER
This is a dead end...

JANCEY
Where are we going?
MOONEE
Shhh! Just follow us.
EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The three sitting on the grass in the dark. The sodium-vapors
light them from above. Halley pulls two 99-cent-store no-namebrand cans of soda and a 40-ounce malt liquor from her bag.
The kids drink their soda, Halley smokes and drinks her 40.
JANCEY
But why are we in the middle of
nowhere in the night?
MOONEE
Shhhh! You’ll see.
FIREWORKS explode overhead. Jancey is in complete awe from
the explosions of magic. Moonee smiles. Halley is excited.

52.
HALLEY
Happy birthday to you! Make a wish,
big girl.
MOONEE
Happy birthday, Jancey.
Wow!

JANCEY

Jancey blows out a candle on a cupcake.
MOONEE
Did you make a birthday wish?
Of course!

JANCEY

The finale is spectacular, it’s cacophony of lights, sounds
and colors bouncing off Jancey and Moonee’s pie-eyed faces.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
Moonee watches Jerry Springer while Halley is waking up with
a hangover.
HALLEY
Go run and get some Waffle Home,

Scooty is with that family in 246.
Extreme delayed response. Looooooong Beat.
What?

HALLEY

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 246 - DAY
Halley knocks hard on the door. ROOM 246 FATHER answers.
Scooty sits on the bed with a 4 year-old ROOM 246 LITTLE
GIRL.

Hey, Halley.

HALLEY
Moonee’s gonna hit the pool, you
wanna come hang?
FATHER
Ashley doesn’t think that’s a good
idea right now, so-HALLEY
‘The fuck does that mean?
ROOM 246 FATHER
Okay, Halley... let’s not go there.
ROOM 246 MOTHER walks over.
ROOM 246 MOTHER
We don’t need your drama.
HALLEY
You haven’t seen me get dramatic,
bitch.
ROOM 246 MOTHER
You define drama queen, bitch.
HALLEY
What did Ashley say about me?
Halley ignores the mother’s attempt to shut down the
conversation and continues to create drama. The mother slams
the door on her.
INT. WAFFLE HOME - DAY
Halley marches into Waffle Home with Moonee. She sits down
and Ashley’s co-worker comes over to take the order.
HALLEY
(points to Ashley)
Sorry, but can she take our order?
The co-worker recognizes Moonee and smiles.
CO-WORKER
Oh, it’s you. Never seen you inside
before. Okay, hold on.
The co-worker approaches Ashley and gestures to Halley.
Ashley approaches the table.
Yeah.

ASHLEY

54.

Yeah?

HALLEY

ASHLEY
How can I help you, Halley?
HALLEY
What’s going on?
ASHLEY
What do you mean?
HALLEY
Moonee’s been telling me she ain’t
welcome here anymore.
ASHLEY
She’s allowed to come into the
establishment, but I can’t be
giving any more food out.
HALLEY
Oh shit, you get in trouble?
ASHLEY
And I don’t want Scooty hanging out
with her or that new kid from
FutureLand anymore.
HALLEY
Okay, so you ain’t in trouble.
What’s goin’ on then?
ASHLEY
Nothing. Nothing to discuss.
Really?
Really.

HALLEY
ASHLEY

Ashley begins to walk away.
HALLEY
Yo. What type of service is that.
You going to take our order?
Ashley takes out her order pad.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Moonee, order whatever the fuck you
want.

55.
MOONEE
Yes! I would like a strawberry
waffle with extra warm syrup and
eggs and bacon and more
strawberries. And blueberries. And
coke. Two of ‘em.
HALLEY
That’s it? You could order more.
MOONEE
Extra bacon. And extra, extra
syrup.
ASHLEY
You got money for all this?
CUT TO:
INT. WAFFLE HOME - DAY - LATER
A bunch of empty plates and mugs surround little Moonee.
Halley looks over to Ashley.
HALLEY
You wanna have a burping contest?
Moonee’s eyes light up. She lets out a huge BELCH.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Whoa, nice one.
Ashley slaps the bill on the table. Halley lifts up the bill
and looks at it.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
I want the rest to go.
Ashley brings a container and bag to the table and begins to
turn away.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Ya gonna pack this for us or do I
call Waffle Home Central and tell
them what I think of one of their
employees?
Ashley packs the containers. All sides are humiliated.
Moonee, oblivious, finishes the last of her waffle.
MOONEE
Say hi to Scooty for me.

56.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
Halley is dragging Moonee home with one hand along the side
of US-192. Halley is walking way too fast.
In an act of rage, Halley chucks the bags into the middle of
oncoming traffic.
A car SCREECHES.
From OFF-SCREEN, an ANGRY DRIVER screams at Halley who
returns a middle finger over her shoulder.
MOONEE
Mom! Why did you do that?
Halley holds back tears.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - NIGHT
Moonee and Halley are in their room. Hip Hop plays from the
phone. Halley is changing into a bikini.
MOONEE
Bobby says we can’t go night
swimming.
HALLEY
Well first off, screw Bobby.
Second, we’re not going swimming...
we’re going to take swimsuit
selfies!
MOONEE
Swimsuit selfies!
Moonee gets excited. She changes into a bathing suit as well.
HALLEY
Swimsuit selfies! That’s right! You
take some of me then I’ll take you.
Okay!

MOONEE

Moonee grabs the phone and takes some shots of her mom posing
in various sexy poses.
HALLEY
Wait, hold up.
Halley carefully removes the pictures of her with Moonee on
the bathroom mirror behind her.

57.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Okay, now. Ready.
MOONEE
You know, selfies are actually when
you take photos of yourself.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Bright daylight. A CHURCH GROUP is handing out bagged loafs
of white bread to various families. Bobby and Magic Castle
Owner Narek stand and watch from a distance. A VICTIM of
domestic abuse stands in line.
NAREK
Do they have to do it right here?
Guests come right through here, for
Christ's sake, Bobby.
BOBBY
Guys, can we move the van to the
back, please? Thank you.
CHURCH VOLUNTEER
Of course, no problem, Bobby.
Moonee shoves her way through the line of people.

Excuse me. Coming through.
CHURCH VOLUNTEER
Hi, what would you like?
Moonee points to some bread.
MOONEE
I want that!
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - BATHROOM - NIGHT

In a MONTAGE sequence, Bobby watches as Moonee and her
daughter make a bunch of trips from their room to a VACANT
MOTEL ROOM (being used as a storage room) located near the

58.
Halley becomes more and more belligerent by carrying less
items on every trip, dragging out the process.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - WALKWAY + EMPTY ROOM - DAY
Bobby is carrying three large plastic bags full of clothes
behind Halley and Moonee.
BOBBY
You know the deal. No reason to
express your opinion about it.
HALLEY
I have an idea. Why don’t you just
say we did this.
BOBBY
I’m not going through this again.
The sooner you’re out, the sooner
you’re back in. Let’s go.
HALLEY
I don’t understand why we got to
even do this, it’s stupid.
BOBBY
I’m not going to explain this to
you every time, Halley... I’m not
letting you establish residency.
Don’t think I think you’re as dumb
as you want me to think. You’ll
fuck me. You don’t want to do it
then you can go.
HALLEY
But who will know if we do this or
not?
Bobby points upwards to one of the many CCTV’s.
BOBBY
And I’m being serious right now...
I’m being straight with you... you
have to square up by Friday.
HALLEY
You need to get laid, son. C’mon,
Moonee.
BOBBY
See you in twenty four hours.

INT. ARABIAN NIGHTS MOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
Halley, holding her duffel bag, stands in front of the
Arabian Nights manager JIMMY (Male, 40’s). Moonee waits with
her backpack.
HALLEY
Hey hey. It’s that time of the
month.
The manager smirks, obviously familiar with Halley. He begins
taking out the paperwork to check her in.
JIMMY
Forty five, my dear.
HALLEY
Forty five? No no. I come here one
night a month and the rate is
thirty five.
JIMMY
One night is forty five.
HALLEY
But the Magic Castle discount...
JIMMY
(motions over his
shoulder)
I know. I know. The new owner is
not honoring the discount.
HALLEY
Not honoring my fuckin’ ass. Oh,
owner! Owner, will you come out
here please?
The ARABIAN NIGHTS OWNER, a South Asian Woman, enters from
the back office.
OWNER
Is everything alright here?

60.
HALLEY
Everything is not alright. I’m
right across the way at Magic
Castle. I come here once a month
and the rate’s $35.
OWNER
Yes, well, our policy has changed.
HALLEY
You can’t just change your policy.
OWNER
I certainly can.
HALLEY
Oh fuck this right now.
Halley takes out her phone and dials up Bobby on speaker.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Hey Bobby, these fuckos at the
Arabian wanna charge me-She extends her arm out to hold the phone closer to the
Owner.
JIMMY
Forty five.
HALLEY
Forty five bucks. Can you tell them
it’s thirty five.
JIMMY
Hey, Bobby -- it’s out of my
control here.
BOBBY
(on phone)
Hey Jimmy. What’s going on?
The owner interrupts.
OWNER
Hello. This is the new owner of
Arabian Nights. Any agreements or
deals your motel had with the
previous owners are no longer being
honored or recognized. Thank you.

61.
BOBBY
(on phone)
Who’s this?
OWNER
This is the new owner. Thank you.
BOBBY
(on phone)
Okay, but what is your name?
OWNER
That is not important. We are very
busy here. Thank you.
HALLEY
Busy? This place is empty, Bobby.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
Bobby crosses Route 192 headed to the Arabian Nights.
INT. ARABIAN NIGHTS MOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
Bobby enters the lobby. Halley and Moonee are splayed out on
the couch. Jimmy and the Arabian Nights Owner are behind the
desk.
BOBBY
Hey, what’s going on?
JIMMY
Yeah, thought you got the memo. No
more discounts for any of the
motels. Not just the Castle.
BOBBY
Please to meet you, Ma’am. I’m
Bobby Horton, I manage the Magic
Castle across the way. There’s been
an agreement in place for a while
where we give a little break to
each other’s tenants for one night
for-OWNER
I’m well aware of the arrangement
you used to have in place with our
motel but as I have said five times
now this is no longer being
honored.

62.
JIMMY
(under his breath)
Just went through this for The
Enchanted Inn.
BOBBY
Can you perhaps just-OWNER
This is not up for discussion.
HALLEY
See what I’m sayin’, Bobby?
MOONEE
She’s a real dickwad.
They all look to Halley, who is holding in laughter.
HALLEY
What are you lookin’ at me for? She
said it.
Bobby does a quick breathing exercise. He then whips out a
ten dollar bill from his wallet and slams it down on the
counter.
BOBBY
(to Moonee)
Magic Castle discount. There ya go.
Sleep tight.
HALLEY
Awwww... the feels. You so sweet,
Bobby. I’m sorry I was a dickwad to
you earlier.
Bobby looks at Moonee, to see if she heard her mom say that.
MOONEE
Don’t look at me, she said it.
OWNER
We don’t need your business. All of
you kindly leave. Thank you.
What?

HALLEY

OWNER
If you could please leave. Thank
you.

63.
HALLEY
I have the forty five. You can’t do
that.
Bobby and Jimmy know this is a no-win situation and keep
quiet.
OWNER
Listen to yourself and your child.
No wonder you are in this
situation. Please leave the
property.
Halley walks forward and spits at the owner. It gets the
intended response. She grabs Moonee and exits into magic
hour.

Halley and Moonee approach the motel.
INT. FUTURELAND INN - JANCEY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Big sleepover with Grandma Stacy/Jancey/Luci/Halley/Moonee.

HALLEY
Damn, girl, this shit looks fancy
in here.
Thank you.

GRANDMA STACY

HALLEY
You an interior decorator or some
shit? It’s mad cozy.
Little Luci plays in one corner. Jancey shows Moonee some of
her stuff in another. Grandma Stacy and Halley sit on the
bed.
MOONEE
Mom, they have so many toys. Why
can’t I have this many toys?
JANCEY
Gramma, if you’ll be in the one bed
with Luci then can I be in the
other with Moonee and her mom?

64.
GRANDMA STACY
Sure, honey.
HALLEY
(pointing to crock-pot)
What’s that?
GRANDMA STACY
What, that? That’s a crock-pot.
That’s where I make my rice and
peas.
HALLEY
Damn, I have to learn how to cook
or something ‘cause those
Lunchables hurt Moonee’s stomach.
MOONEE
Lunchables suck.
(nods)
Crock-Pot.

GRANDMA STACY

JANCEY
Gramma, can they sleep here every
night?
Yeah!

MOONEE

JANCEY
This is gonna be the bestest
funnest sleepover ever.
HALLEY
Since it’s bedtime can we finally
go outside and smoke a blunt?
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - EMPTY ROOM + ROOM 323 - DAY
Bobby unlocks the storage room for Halley and Moonee.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PLAYGROUND - DAY
Moonee, Jancey and Cubby (now with 2 casts on his arms) are

approaches.
SUSPICIOUS MAN
Hi, Kids. Having fun?

65.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 3RD FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Bobby is up on a ladder painting the gutter of the third
floor walkway. Bobby notices the Suspicious Man speaking with
the kids down below. A full bucket of purple paint falls and
almost hits a LUCKY RESIDENT.
LUCKY RESIDENT
What the fuck, Bobby?!
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Bobby exits the stairwell and makes a bee-line towards the
playground. Lucky Resident wipes paint off himself.
Bobby turns and walks towards the playground. The commotion
has caused the Suspicious Man to look over and see Bobby
approaching. He begins to walk away.
BOBBY
Excuse me? Can I help you?
SUSPICIOUS MAN
No, that’s okay.
BOBBY
What’s okay? You a guest here?
SUSPICIOUS MAN
Um, no. Just looking for um, a soda
machine.
BOBBY
Yeah, come to a motel to get a
soda?
SUSPICIOUS MAN
Yeah, it’s okay. Thanks anyway.
BOBBY
No, no, no. Follow me.
SUSPICIOUS MAN
No really, it’s okay. I’ll find a
convenience store.
BOBBY
I’ll show you where the machine is.
Come with me.
The suspicious man reluctantly follows Bobby.

66.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
You parched?
Oh yeah.

SUSPICIOUS MAN

BOBBY
Got to whet that palate?
SUSPICIOUS MAN
Yeah. I never did get used to this
humidity.
They walk by the drying paint.
SUSPICIOUS MAN (CONT’D)
Looks like you have stuff to tend
to here. I’ll just go ahead and
find it somewhere else.
BOBBY
No, it’s right over here. Come on.
Bobby escorts the nervous old man over to the soda machine
near the utility room.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Look at those choices.
The man stands there nervously.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
What are you waiting for?
The man puts coins in the machine and chooses a Fresca.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
What a choice.
SUSPICIOUS MAN
Okay, thank you.
BOBBY
Wait. Thought you were thirsty. Not
going to drink it now?
The jittery man cracks open the can and drinks. Extremely
awkward silence.
Good?
Yeah.

BOBBY (CONT’D)
SUSPICIOUS MAN

67.
The man takes a swig and Bobby slaps the can out of his hand.
BOBBY
Get the fuck out of here now.
The man turns around and begins walking toward the front of
the motel. Bobby is right on his back, very threatening.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
(through gritted teeth)
I see you back on this property
again and you won’t be leaving it,
understand?
SUSPICIOUS MAN
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
BOBBY
Yeah, you don’t know what I’m
talking about? Gonna play it like
that?
They are passing by the lobby at this point, Bobby grabs the
man in a semi-headlock and reaches into his front pockets.
The feeble man is scared and squirms. Bobby quickly yanks out
a wallet. He opens it and looks at the driver’s license.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Alright... Charles Coachman of
Cherry Hill, New Jersey...
SUSPICIOUS MAN
What business is that of yours?
Bobby chucks the wallet over his head. The man pathetically
chases after it.
BOBBY
Calling in your name to the
precinct, motherfucker. See you
here again and I swear to God...
The man swiftly walks away towards Route 192.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - BATHROOM - NIGHT

A church group is parked at The Magic Castle. Residents take
advantage of the food being passed out.

Going to marry it?
Yeah.

JANCEY

MOONEE
You’re going to have to kiss it

Jancey laughs and kisses the jelly.
JANCEY
This is a cool place for our new

69.

Why?

even talk to that bitch.

Bobby straightens up.
BOBBY
But I didn’t.
Push.

JACK

BOBBY
I didn’t. Why did you do that?
Jack is still trying to push the machine. Bobby stops as they
get it half way into the elevator.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Why would you do that? Call her and
tell her I didn’t.
The elevator door attempts to close. Bobby uses his foot to
keep it from shutting.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
First you get her on the phone and
you tell her I didn’t wish her
anything damn it.
JACK
Ya know what-Jack backs off the ice machine.
JACK (CONT’D)
Keep your hundred bucks.
BOBBY
Hey. I thought you’d appreciate the
extra work.
JACK
Uh no. It takes an hour and a half
to drive here. Totally screws my
Saturday. I don’t need the extra
work. Give your money to him.
Jack turns and points to a resident sitting on the walkway.
JACK (CONT’D)
Or her. They need it. Or just tell
your boss to hire an extra hand.

72.
Bobby thinks for a moment.
BOBBY
Okay then. Just help me get this
downstairs.

Halley and Moonee visit a nearby theme park ticket hub and
Halley attempts to sell four unused theme park ticket
wristbands to TICKET HUT WORKER.
HALLEY
Do I look like a ticket scammer?
These were never used, they don’t
have the biometric finger print
thingies or whatever they are
assigned to them yet.
TICKET HUT WORKER
I understand but still not
interested.
HALLEY
Who’s gonna know?
TICKET HUT WORKER
I don’t know what to tell you. Try
at the parks.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - TICKET HUT - LATER
Halley and Moonee loiter a bit further away from Ticket Hut.
A rental car pulls into the lot with BRITISH MOM, BRITISH

place.

Hey, you going in there?
I am.

BRITISH DAD

HALLEY
Don’t buy from these places, they
rope you into to buying timeshares.
I got some I’m trying to sell.
BRITISH DAD
No thank you.
HALLEY
Dude, they’ll make you do a two
hour tour and hard sell you, you
really wanna do that shit on your
vacation?
Moonee holds out the multi-colored MagicBands displayed on
her wrist like a used watch salesman.

74.
BRITISH DAD
You’re selling the ticket bands?
HALLEY
I have four, they charge $164 per
day so, that’s like $600, so I can
do $400 cash.
BRITISH DAD
And these will work? No tricks?
HALLEY
They’re totally unused. My family
had to cancel our vacation and they
don’t give refunds. But we didn’t
use them, they’ll work, I could
even go with you to the front gates
or whatever so you know I’m for
real.
BRITISH DAD
These are Park-Hoppers, yeah?
HALLEY
Sure. Yeah.
TICKET-BUYING DAD
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Shall we say
$250?
Cash?
Yeah.

HALLEY
BRITISH DAD

HALLEY
Lowest I can go is $300. And that’s
a steal, man.
BRITISH DAD
Right then.
The dad takes out the cash.
HALLEY
Give the man the bands, Moon.
Moonee reluctantly gives him the MagicBands, Halley takes the
cash.
BRITISH DAD
Thanks, sweetheart.

75.
INT./EXT. DOLLAR STORE - DAY
Halley brings Moonee on a shopping spree and plays in the
aisles of the Dollar Store. They exit and Halley pushes
Moonee home in the shopping cart. They put on British
accents, making fun of the dad they just sold bands to.
HALLEY
Are they... pok-hoppahs?
MOONEE
Me needs dem pok-hoppahs!
They giggle as they speed up and ride coast along with their
shopping cart.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Halley watches as Bobby scans Halley’s rent money, mostly big
bills, under the counterfeit detector. Amber is working in
the background. Moonee is outside, sitting in the shopping
cart.
BOBBY
Back in the work force?
Say what?
New job?
Yeah.

HALLEY
BOBBY
HALLEY

BOBBY
Interesting hours.
What?

HALLEY

BOBBY
Number one, I see you around in
PJ’s all day, every day. Number
two, if you are working, who’s
looking after Moonee?
HALLEY
Umm, mind you own business, Bro.
Bobby looks and sees Moonee in the shopping cart outside the
lobby. Moonee waves.

76.
BOBBY
Get that stolen cart off the
property.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
Halley and Moonee are on the bed. There is pounding at the
door. Halley gets up and looks through the peep hole. She
turns around and walks back to the bed.
Who is it?

MOONEE

HALLEY
Nobody. Go away asshole or I’m
gonna call the police!
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY - CONTINUOUS
We see our bathroom John pounding on the door. He continues
as Bobby approaches.
BOBBY
Hey. Hey. Hey. What’s goin’ on?
JOHN
None of your business, Bro.
BOBBY
It is my business. I’m the manager
here. What’s going on?
JOHN
The girl who lives here has
something of mine.
BOBBY
The six year-old?
JOHN
No. The mom.
Bobby knocks on the door and convinces Halley to open it.
BOBBY
This guy says you have something of
his.
HALLEY
I don’t know who this guy is.

77.
BOBBY
She doesn’t know who you are. Wrong
girl. Now c’mon. Gotta to leave the
property if you’re not staying
here.
JOHN
I’m not leaving until she gives me
my four MagicBands. She lifted four
MagicBands from my jeans.
HALLEY
What the fuck is a Magical Band? I
don’t what this guy is talkin’
about.
JOHN
When I was in the bathroom, you
took my family’s fucking bands.
BOBBY
Let’s go. She doesn’t know what
you’re talking about.
Halley has not changed her blank expression.
JOHN
I know you know what I’m talking
about Goddamnit! I want them back
NOW! You stole $1700. That’s grand
larceny.
That lost profit margin stings Halley but she retains her
composure. Bobby intervenes.
BOBBY
Listen, bud, look, I’ll be happy to
call the cops right now. We’ll put
in a report. You can tell them what
your business was on the premises.
Four of those bracelets? So I can
assume this was for your wife and
children, yeah?
John has calmed down.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Right. So why don’t you get the
fuck off this property now and
don't let me see you here again.
John leaves, defeated.

78.
HALLEY
It’s about time you make yourself
useful, can you believe that shit?
Bobby takes a deep breath and slowly turns around to Halley.
BOBBY
I am trying to keep this job. And I
am going to keep this job. I’m
trying to keep this place free of
headaches. And you are the biggest
headache.
HALLEY
I’m your biggest headache? You got
MS-13 in 204, dude.
BOBBY
I swear to God, Halley. No more. If
you have guests, they have to check
in with me at the front desk.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 3RD FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Bobby walks towards the front office, Halley follows,
barefoot and in pajamas.
HALLEY
What the fuck are you talking
about?
Moonee begins to follow her mother onto the walkway.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Get the fuck back inside, Moonee!
Moonee complies.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
You can’t just NOT let me have
guests. What gives you the
authority!
BOBBY
Um, my job title?
HALLEY
I have friends though, I have a lot
friends.

79.
BOBBY
They’re gonna have to check in with
me. That means ID. They have to
leave it at the front desk.
HALLEY
That’s like invasion of privacy
shit.
Bobby almost laughs.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Bobby enters the lobby followed by Halley. Amber is behind
the counter.
HALLEY
Oh fuck you, Bobby, I don’t gotta
do shit.
BOBBY
Out of the lobby. Now. Seriously.
You have three seconds to get out
of the lobby or you’re outta here
tonight. I’m sure the Hope Center
has a room for you somewhere.
Stare down.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
One. Two...
Halley leaves swearing her ass off. From outside, she
continues to berate Bobby but he ignores her.
Finally, she takes out a maxi-pad from and sticks it to the
lobby window. She storms off.
AMBER
And I thought I’ve seen it all.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LAUNDRY AREA - DAY
Halley and Moonee sit on washing machines in back of Magic
Castle. A previously-seen woman comes by, sees Halley, turns
around.
HALLEY
Bobby fixed these?
She ignores her and continues to walk away.

80.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
What the fuck is wrong with her?
EXT. BIG FIELD - DAY
Moonee and Jancey play in a field behind Route 192. It begins
to rain. They sit under a tree and wait it out.
JANCEY
Moonee, why did you take me on this
adventure?
MOONEE
I didn’t know it was gonna rain all
over the place.
JANCEY
Well I hope there’s another rainbow
after it stops so we can still
catch that leprechaun.
The rain stops. The girls walk out onto the field. No
rainbow.
Cattle and horses pass by.
MOONEE
See? I took you on a safari.
They both share a laugh and a smile.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
Moonee and Jancey are walking back, still wet from the rain.
Jancey is no longer upset to be wet.
INT. JOHN’S CAR - ROUTE 192 - DAY (TRAVELLING)
While driving along Route 192, John spots Moonee and Jancey
walking on the side of the road.
He pulls over abruptly, startling his JOHN WIFE (39) in the
passenger seat and his two JOHN KIDS in the back seat.
He parks on the shoulder and jumps out of the car.
JOHN WIFE
What’s going on?
Stay here.

JOHN

81.
EXT. ROUTE 192 - DAY
The John catches up to Moonee and Jancey on the side of the
road.
JOHN
Hey! You two! Hey, girls! Yeah.
Thought that was you.
The kids are frightened.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Don’t be scared. I’ve just got to
tell you something.
He rests his hand on her shoulder and calmly leans in and
speaks in her ear.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Guess what? You’re going to grow up
and be a prostitute just like
mother. You know what a prostitute
is? It’s a whore. And that’s what
you have to look forward to. That’s
all you have to look forward to.
The John returns to the car.
INT. JOHN’S CAR - ROUTE 192 - DAY (TRAVELLING)
John pulls the car away, his family bewildered.
JOHN WIFE
What was that?
JOHN
Oh, they gave me directions the
other day and I just wanted to
thank them.
JOHN WIFE
Aww, that was sweet.
She looks at her husband with loving eyes.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 223 - DUSK
Halley reluctantly approaches Room 223. She knocks. Scooty
answers.
SCOOTY
Mom, it’s Halley.

82.
Ashley approaches the door.
ASHLEY
(motioning to walk away)
Scooty.
(to Halley)
What?
HALLEY
Hey, look. I don’t know what Moonee
did. She probably did some shit and
I’m sorry about that. But I don’t
think that shit should, you know,
affect us, you know? They’re kids.
ASHLEY
Is that it?
HALLEY
Yeah, well, look. Can you help me
with rent this week? I’m ass out.
Ashley chuckles.
What?

HALLEY (CONT’D)

ASHLEY
I think you got it covered.
HALLEY
What are you talking about.
ASHLEY
You don’t think everybody knows
what’s up Halley? Like everybody?
HALLEY
‘The fuck are you talking about?
Bitch...

ASHLEY

Ashley leans back and grabs the phone from her night stand.
She approaches the door as she pulls up a web page.
ASHLEY (CONT’D)
That’s you.
Ashley lifts the phone and shows an ad on Backpage.com. It’s
clearly a photo taken on the “swimsuit selfies” night. Bikiniclad Halley shot from the neck down. A phone number is
printed across the image.

83.
HALLEY
That’s not me.
Ashley laughs.
ASHLEY
Are you fucking kidding me?! Those
are your tats bitch! And I swear to
God, if Scooty was ever in that
room when you were whoring out,
I’ll fuckin’ kill you-Halley attacks Ashley. The women topple over the bed and
Halley proceeds to beat Ashley hard. Three blows to the face.
Halley looks up and sees Scooty watching this, stunned and
frozen. She leaves.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - NIGHT
Halley runs past Moonee who is sitting on the bed. She
projectile vomits in bathroom.
MOONEE

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Moonee shows Jancey a rainbow.
EXT./INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY — DAY
From inside the lobby looking outside...
Moonee and Jancey are sitting in the same chair together.
Outside, a car drives by.
In the back office, the elevator monitor shows two
individuals at Room 323 (CASE WORKER, seen earlier and a DCF
INVESTIGATOR). This grabs Bobby’s attention. He leaves the
office and passes by Amber.

84.
BOBBY
I think the city’s here.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DAY
Jancey and Moonee come out, trailing after Bobby. They follow
him down the entire walkway. Bobby turns around and sees the
kids following him.
BOBBY
Hey guys, go back to the lobby
okay?
MOONEE
Wait, you want us IN the lobby now?
JANCEY
This guy is coo-coo crazy.
The kids continue to follow him.
Bobby turns the corner, near the elevator and walks swiftly
up the stairs.
He walks onto the third floor walkway. Over his shoulder -- a
commotion at Room 323.
BOBBY
Girls, stay here okay? I mean it.
The girls stop at the top of the stairwell. Bobby continues
to approach 323.
JANCEY
(to Moonee)
They’re at your room.
The camera stays with the kids as the commotion continues
down the walkway. We hear shouting from the distance.
HALLEY
(to Bobby as he
approaches)
...you call DCF on me,
motherfucker?
BOBBY
I don’t know what you’re talking
about. What’s this all about?
The DCF Investigator and Case Worker try to explain as Halley
starts to flip out.

85.
HALLEY
Ashley called DCF on me, didn’t
she?
DCF INVESTIGATOR
Ma’am, we received a call and it
doesn’t matter from who-HALLEY
You fucking tell me who called you
and I’ll tell you why it happened.
If it was Ashley she’s hating
‘cause I beat her ass.
CASE WORKER
You’re getting into fights?
Bobby notices Moonee and Jancey inching closer and goes back
to stop them.
BOBBY
Girls, please, just wait right
here, okay, please?
MOONEE
Why is my mom yelling?
BOBBY
She’s just talking to these ladies.
Jancey, you should go home for now,
okay?
JANCEY
Yes, Bobby. Bye, Moonee.
HALLEY
You’re not coming into my place, I
didn’t do nothin’ wrong. You don’t
have no court order!
MOONEE
But why is she so upset?
BOBBY
I don’t know. They’re just talking.
Halley continues to yell and shout.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
It’ll be okay, just some sort of
confusion.
Halley notices Bobby talking to Moonee.

86.
HALLEY
You’re doing this in front of my
fuckin’ kid?
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - DAY
We follow Jancey as she walks home alone. She looks back over
her shoulder a couple of times from the end of the driveway.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
The DCF Investigator is outside with Bobby and Moonee. We see
them through the glass doors. Amber sits in the background.
Halley is sitting on Moonee’s chair in the lobby. She is
calming down.
HALLEY
I’ve been looking after her fucking
kid while she’s off making money.
How am I supposed to make any
money, huh? How?
So...
So what?

CASE WORKER
HALLEY

CASE WORKER
So will you take a drug test for
DCF?
HALLEY
You know I smoke. But that’s it.
CASE WORKER
Refuse the test and start flushing
your system.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
Bobby smokes a cigarette. Moonee hides in the enclave.
DCF INVESTIGATOR
(to Moonee)
Want to come out here and talk with
me, Moonee?
Moonee just shakes her head.

87.
DCF INVESTIGATOR (CONT’D)
(to Bobby)
Are you aware of any possible
neglect of this child? The child
being left unattended, going
hungry, being in the room while
the mother is engaging in illegal
activity.
Bobby thinks for a moment.
BOBBY
If I did, you would have heard from
me.
DCF INVESTIGATOR
Can you tell me the kinds of stuff
you do each day, Moonee?
Silence.
DCF INVESTIGATOR (CONT’D)
You ever swim in the pool?
Yeah. Duh.

MOONEE

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DAY
The case worker continues to speak with Halley.
CASE WORKER
Okay, well then, DCF has opened an
investigation. She’s going to be
collecting evidence based on the
accusations. She could be back here
by the end of the week. Hopefully
there is nothing to find. You
understand?
Halley just stares.
CASE WORKER (CONT’D)
Now, I have to warn you. Staying
unemotional when they return is in
your best interest. You do what you
did today and your actions will be
considered detrimental to Moonee.
This will not help your case in any
way. You understand?

88.
Halley’s eyebrows raise -- the ultimate sarcastic,
belligerent expression that has “you can go fuck yourself”
written all over it.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - NIGHT
Moonee is asleep while Halley lies next to her smoking a
cigarette and fighting the tears. Finally, she gets up out of
bed and begins pounding the floor with her foot repeatedly.
Moonee stirs.
MOONEE
What’s going on?
HALLEY
Nothing. Go back to bed.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
Halley and Moonee clean up the room.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - OFFICE - DAY
Bobby, Narek and the DCF Investigator are crammed in the back
office.
BOBBY
You understand that we don’t have
to let them review this, right? Let
them get a subpoena.
NAREK
Are you crazy? You want a court
case against Magic Castle? That’s
the last thing I need. They can
review all they want. Plus, this is
about the possible neglect of a
child.
Thank you.

DCF INVESTIGATOR

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - LAUNDRY AREA - DAY
Halley approaches Bertha who is folding towels.
HALLEY
I have a present for you.
Halley hands over a bag of weed.

89.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
This is for you. But make sure you
smoke all of it.
Thank you.

BERTHA

HALLEY
Enjoy that shit for me.
BERTHA
Hey. Halley. Don’t worry. It will
all be okay.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - LOBBY - DUSK
Bobby walks out of the lobby. Three CRANES stare back at him,
refusing to budge.
Bobby shoos them off the driveway. They slowly move off the
asphalt.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - PICNIC TABLES - DAY
Moonee and Halley sit on the picnic tables. They are painting
each other’s toenails. They decide to paint each toe a
different color.
They watch as Ashley exits her room with Scooty (this is the
first time we see her post-beatdown). She is bruised badly.
She walks him down the stairs to Room 246.
Ashley then walks silently across the parking lot and down
the driveway in her Waffle Home uniform.
It begins raining hard. The two don’t mind.
Adventure?

HALLEY

EXT./INT. CALYPSO CAY - BUFFET ROOM - DAY
Halley takes Moonee to a much nicer hotel down Route 192
where they go in and partake in the free breakfast buffet.
Moonee is most excited about how she can make her own waffles
that are shaped as a famous mouse.
Moonee is ecstatic about the delicious food she is eating.
Halley tries her best to converse with her daughter but
spends most of the time holding back tears. (This scene will
be shot holding on Moonee’s face as she eats).
MOONEE
I wish forks were made of candy.
(beat)
Then I could eat the forks after my
meal.
(beat)
We gotta come here all the time.
(beat)
Mom, you look busted.
(beat)
I’m going to put a strawberry,
raspberry and bacon in my mouth at
the same time.
Moonee continues to stuff her face. A HOTEL WORKER (female,
20’s) walks over, eyeing them.
HOTEL WORKER
Could I get your room number?
323.
Thank you.

HALLEY
HOTEL WORKER

Halley winks at Moonee. Moonee lets out a little smirk.
Moonee continues to eat as Halley sits in silence, her watery
eyes watching her daughter at her happiest.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
Halley and Moonee come back from breakfast and walk by two
police cars in the parking lot.

91.
The Case Worker, DCF Investigator, a DCF WORKER and Bobby are
accompanied by a DCF SUPERVISOR and TWO SHERIFFS.
Halley and Moonee make it to their room. Halley pushes past
everyone and opens her room. She turns around and faces
everyone.
HALLEY
Can I help you? Because you’ll need
a court order to get me to take a
drug test.
CASE WORKER
Halley, these DCF officers are here
in regards to Moonee.
HALLEY
You wanna inspect my room? Be our
guest.
The group follows Halley inside the room.
HALLEY (CONT’D)
Wanna shake my cereal boxes to
check for buried treasure? Look
inside my fridge?
Halley?

DCF INVESTIGATOR

HALLEY
What? What do you want?
DCF INVESTIGATOR
We have security footage that shows
nine different men entering and
exiting your room over the last
three weeks.
BOBBY
Uh, why don’t you take little
Moonee outside so you can talk
privately.
The case worker escorts Moonee outside the room.
DCF INVESTIGATOR
We’ve also obtained an online
classified ad soliciting costumers
for sexual activities with your
phone number attached.
Halley takes a moment to make eye contact with each person.

92.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
MOONEE
Go? For how many days?
CASE WORKER
It’ll only be temporary.
MOONEE
What’s temporary?
CASE WORKER
That just means for a little bit of
time, can we do that? There will be
lots and lots of toys, okay?
MOONEE
I guess so.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
DCF INVESTIGATOR
...but luckily we have a family in
Polk County that can take her for
the entire course of the
investigation.
Halley remains calm and collected. Bobby watches silently.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
MOONEE
Can I say goodbye to my friend
Scooty?
CASE WORKER
We don’t call it a goodbye but you
can give your friend a hug. And
you’ll see them soon. I’ll check to
see if that’s okay.
The case worker peers back into the room.
CASE WORKER (CONT’D)
She wants to say bye to her friend.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
A nod of approval from inside.

93.
DCF WORKER
I’ll take her.
DCF INVESTIGATOR
My colleague will take Moonee
downstairs to say goodbye. In the
meantime, it'd be great if you
could pack her a bag, also maybe a
favorite doll or toy.
Halley silently complies.
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 3RD AND 2ND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY
Moonee is escorted down to Room 223 by the case worker. They
knock on the door. Ashley answers.
Yes?

ASHLEY

DCF WORKER
Hello, Miss. My name is Susan
Watson and I’m with DCF. We have a
quick favor to ask.
MOONEE
Ashley, what happened to your face?
SCOOTY
Hi, Moonee. My mom said you’re
leaving?
MOONEE
It’s a temporary. We can do a hug
or a high-five.
They choose both.
Thank you.

DCF WORKER

MOONEE
I hope your eye feels better,
Ashley.
ASHLEY
Thank you, baby.
SCOOTY
My mom said you’re going to another
family.

94.

Scooty.

ASHLEY

DCF WORKER
Thanks again so much.
Ashley pushes Scooty inside and closes the door as Moonee is
walked back toward the stairs.
MOONEE
Why did he say I’m going to another
family?
DCF WORKER
You’re just going to live with them
for a little while.
MOONEE
Wait, are those cops-- are they
taking my mom away?
No.

DCF WORKER

MOONEE
Are they taking me to a stranger
family?
DCF WORKER
We’re taking you to a nice family.
Just for a little-MOONEE
Well I don’t want to.
DCF WORKER
Okay, Moonee, your mom knows about
this and-Stop.

MOONEE

Moonee stops following her up the stairs.
DCF WORKER
Your mom know about it and says
it’s okay-MOONEE
Stop! You want me to get super
angry?

95.

Halley is packing Moonee’s clothes in a small bag. She takes
one of the photo booth strips (of Halley and Moonee) off the
mirror and puts it in the bag.
The case worker comes back into the room.
CASE WORKER
Halley, we need you. She’s being
very emotional right now.
HALLEY
You want me to help you take my
child away from me? Are you
retarded? You stupid, right?
EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - 2ND FLOOR STAIRS - DAY
Moonee refuses to take another step back up towards the
police.
MOONEE
I want to say goodbye to Jancey.
DCF WORKER
Which room does Jancey live in?
MOONEE
She’s at FutureLand.
DCF INVESTIGATOR
We have to go. We can’t go over
there right now. You’ll be seeing
your friends soon.
MOONEE
No, I won’t. That’s a lie.

96.
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - DAY
HALLEY
You're literally asking me to help
you take away my fucking kid.

That way!

Jesus Christ.
The police officers and Bobby run to the front of the motel.
HALLEY
What’s going on?
CASE WORKER
(winded)
Moonee ran away. We think she went

Please Halley...

What’s going on? Moonee?
Jancey is scared. Moonee is frantic. She can no longer hold

EXT. THEME PARK ENTRANCE GATES - DAY
Jancey encourages Moonee to hurry up and follow her toward a
big parking lot entrance gate. A MONORAIL whizzes by
overhead.
EXT. THEME PARK - MAIN STREET - DAY
Jancey and Moonee’s little torn-up sneakers run past hundreds
of tourists’ legs, park maps and deflated balloons on the
asphalt of the park’s “Main Street USA”.
Moonee’s feet pick up speed. She hops over a spilled MOUSESHAPED ICE CREAM BAR. Her feet leap out of frame.
EXT. THEME PARK - DAY
Jancey and Moonee sprint faster than ever...
Weaving through TOURISTS... through CAST MEMBERS...
They race toward a perfect enchanted storybook CASTLE,
glimmering in the sun against a dreamlike sky.
