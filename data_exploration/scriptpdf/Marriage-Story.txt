What I love about Nicole...
INT. THEATER. MANHATTAN. DAY
Nicole, early 30’s, appears out of the dark.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.
We remain CLOSE on her face in shadow.

She’s very still

She really listens when someone is

A young “funny” ASPCA

SOLICITOR
Hey, you look like you care about
animals?
I do.

NICOLE

CHARLIE (V.O.)
...sometimes she listens TOO
much, for too long-- She’s
a good citizen.

The kid launches into his pitch. She listens intently and
starts writing down her phone number.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She always knows the right thing
to do when it comes to difficult
family shit.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. DAY
Charlie is sulking.

A hand holds out a phone.

NICOLE (O.S.)
Just call him.
No.

CHARLIE
NICOLE (O.S.)
Call him.

No.

NICOLE
(with real empathy)
Call him.
He reluctantly grabs the phone.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I get stuck in my ways and she
knows when to push me and when to
leave me alone.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. ANOTHER DAY
She cuts their son, (8 years old) Henry’s hair.

She cuts all our hair.

CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s always inexplicably brewing
a cup of tea that she doesn’t
drink.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. SEVERAL DAYS
A kettle whistles.
STILL LIFES of mugs of tea on window sills, bookshelves,
Henry’s toy shelf, on the floor...
All the kitchen cabinets are open. Charlie closing
drawers, picking up shoes. Charlie hitting his head on the
corner of an open cabinet.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And it’s not easy for her to put
away a sock, or close a cabinet,
or do a dish, but she tries for
me.

sister) standing in the front lawn of a Hollywood home.

3.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Nicole grew up in LA around actors
and directors and movies and TV
and is very close to her mother,
Sandra, and, Cassie, her sister.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. ANOTHER DAY
Charlie rips open a present.

It’s a trumpet.

CHARLIE (V.O.)
Nicole gives great presents. She
is a mother who plays -- really
plays -- she never steps off
playing or says it’s too much (and
it must be too much some of the
time).
EXT. PROSPECT PARK, BROOKLYN. DAY
She and Henry play in the park with Star Wars figures.

Arrrh, waaa, urgh...
Arrgh--

HENRY
No, he’s dead.

NICOLE
My guy is dead?
HENRY
He’s dead but you can use this
guy.
NICOLE
(taking that guy)
Arrrhhggg--

CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s competitive.

INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. ANOTHER DAY
Nicole, Charlie and Henry are playing Monopoly.
NICOLE
Goddammit! I was just IN jail!
Henry and Charlie look at each other and laugh.
NICOLE
Do NOT laugh at me.
Do NOT LAUGH AT ME!

I’m serious.

INT. HENRY’S ROOM. ANOTHER NIGHT
Nicole is reading to Henry in bed. She’s falling asleep
while reading, but still managing to read.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s a great dancer. Infectious.
She makes me wish I could dance.
INT. THEATER. NIGHT
Nicole putting on a song and getting people to dance at a
cast party.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She always says when she doesn’t
know something or hasn’t read a
book or seen a film or a play
(whereas I fake it or say
something like, “I haven’t seen it
in a while.”) She keeps the
fridge over-full. No one is ever
hungry in our house. She can
drive a stick.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S KITCHEN. ANOTHER DAY
Charlie’s trying to open a jar of pickles. He struggles.
He knocks it on a table. Grabs a dish towel and tries it
that way. No luck.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms, which
I’ve always found very sexy.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. ANOTHER DAY
On TV, a younger Nicole (acting in a movie) is part of a
raucous college party.
NICOLE IN THE MOVIE
You might as well get what you
paid for!
She grabs her shirt and lifts it-before it comes off.

We PAUSE mid-lift

CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s brave. After that movie,
All Over The Girl, she could have
stayed in LA and been a movie
star, but she gave that up to do
theater with me in New York.

5.
INT. THEATER. DAY
We’re back to the first image of her face in half-shadow.
Suddenly she walks forward and into a spotlight.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
My crazy ideas are her favorite
things to figure out how to
execute.
She walks across the floor and climbs (scales like a rockface) the body of a male actor.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Try it crawling but also standing.
We see that she’s on a stage, rehearsing for a play.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She’s my favorite actress.
INT. THEATER. SAME DAY

A warm

NICOLE (V.O.)
What I love about Charlie...
Charlie is undaunted. He never
lets other people’s opinions or
any set-backs keep him from what
he wants to do.
INT. PIZZERIA, PARK SLOPE, BROOKLYN. DAY
Charlie eats sloppily with Henry at a pizza place. He
suddenly stands up and walks around to Henry’s side. He
asks Henry to raise his arms. He lifts Henry’s sweater up
over his arms and turns it around to face the right way.
NICOLE (V.O.)
Charlie eats like he’s trying to
get it over with and like there
won’t be enough food for everyone.
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured. But he’s
incredibly neat and I rely on him
to keep things in order.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. LATE DAY
Nicole is reading in a room. All the lights go out.
looks up. Charlie is at the switch.

She

6.

Sorry.

CHARLIE
NICOLE (V.O.)
He’s energy conscious.
He turns them back on.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He doesn’t look in the mirror too
often. He cries easily in movies.
EXT. MOVIE THEATER. DAY
He and Henry exit a movie theater.
crying.

Both of them are

HENRY
I cried four times.
CHARLIE
Me too. I wonder if it was the
same four.
NICOLE (V.O)
He is very self-sufficient -- he
can darn a sock and cook himself
dinner and iron a shirt.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S KITCHEN. EVE
He’s cooking - it’s elaborate. There are a lot of pots, a
lot of steam. Henry is “helping.”
HENRY
(holding up a knife)
The peppers are cut!
NICOLE (V.O.)
He rarely gets defeated (which I
feel like I always do).
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. ANOTHER DAY
Nicole is raging about something.
NICOLE (V.O.)
Charlie takes all of my moods
steadily, he doesn’t give in to
them or make me feel bad about
them. He’s a great dresser, he
never looks embarrassing which is
hard for a man.

7.
INT. TENNIS BUBBLE. DAY
Charlie is serving in a tennis game.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He’s very competitive.
He double faults.
CHARLIE
(to himself)
Goddammit Charlie!
together.

Get it

INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S BEDROOM. NIGHT
Henry walks into their bedroom and taps Charlie on the
shoulder until he wakes up.
HENRY
(whispers)
I had a bad dream.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He loves being a dad, he loves all
the things you’re supposed to
hate, like the tantrums, the
waking up at night.
INT. HENRY’S ROOM. SAME
He puts Henry back to sleep. Henry doesn’t want to sleep.
They compromise with Charlie sleeping on the floor. Then
Henry climbing down and sleeping with him on the floor.
Then Charlie slipping out and getting into the bed. Then
the kid getting into the bed with him.
NICOLE (V.O.)
It’s almost annoying how much he
likes it, but then it’s mostly
nice.
INT. SUBWAY/PLATFORM. DAY
He and Henry reading on the subway. The doors close.
train lurches forward. Charlie looks up suddenly.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He disappears into his own world.
He and Henry are alike in that
way.
Shit!

CHARLIE

The

8.
HENRY
What’s “shit?”
CHARLIE
That was our stop!
INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT
NICOLE (V.O.)
He can tell people they have food
in their teeth or on their face in
a way that doesn’t make them feel
bad.
Nicole, from across a table picks something from between
her teeth, she looks back up at Charlie who is off-camera,
and smiles. It’s still there. She starts digging for it
again.
INT. THEATER OFFICE. DAY
NICOLE (V.O.)
Charlie is self-made -- his
parents -- I only met them once -but he told me there was a lot of
alcohol and some violence in his
childhood.
Henry plays on the floor. Charlie leads a meeting with his
set decorator and Nicole and the stage manager around a big
table. They reference a model of the stage set.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net and now he’s
more a New Yorker than any New
Yorker.
INT. THEATER. ANOTHER DAY
Charlie is passing out coffees to all the actors and crew
members of their theater at the beginning of a rehearsal.
He’s gotten everyone’s drink right, and bought them all
himself.
NICOLE (V.O.)
He’s brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

9.
CHARLIE
I made sure they used the
right almond milk--

NICOLE (V.O.)
With the theatre company he
cast a spell that made
everyone feel included. No
one, not even an intern was
unimportant. He could
remember all the inside
jokes.

CHARLIE
(handing an intern a
coffee)
And where do YOU go when it’s
windy?!
YOUNG INTERN
(laughing, flattered,
remembering)
Oh yeah, that was funny!
INT. THEATER. PREVIOUS DAY
We RETURN to the close-up of Charlie. He sits in the back
of an empty theater taking notes, the small yellow reading
light illuminating his face. He watches Nicole, in
rehearsal, climb up onto the actor as she did earlier.
CHARLIE
Let’s stop there.
Nicole, up almost atop the actor’s head, turns to him with
a look that asks, “Was that OK?” Charlie nods.
INT. MEDIATOR’S OFFICE. DAY
CLOSE on a sheet of paper: We can see written everything we
just heard.
MEDIATOR (O.S.)
Who wants to start?
Nicole, no make-up, in a baggy sweatshirt and jeans, sits
in a chair, not saying a word, staring at a piece of paper
in her lap.
NICOLE
I’m not going to read this out
loud.
MEDIATOR (O.S.)
Why is that?
NICOLE
I don’t like what I wrote.

10.
We see now that she and Charlie are sitting in two adjacent
chairs in an office on the Upper West Side. A male
mediator, 50’s, in a sweater vest wearing too many rings,
tightly cross-legged, facing them.
MEDIATOR
As we mediate your separation and
eventual divorce, things can
become quite contentious, so I
like to begin with a note of
positivity. For the people I work
with to remember why they got
married in the first place. And
so, that as you come apart, you’re
reminded that this is a person you
had great feeling for and maybe
still do in many ways-CHARLIE
(holding up his phone)
I’ll read mine. I like what I
wrote.
MEDIATOR
For it to really work, you both
have to read-NICOLE
(folding up her paper)
I’m not going to.
OK--

MEDIATOR

CHARLIE
She always says I can’t
write. But I think mine is
pretty good.

MEDIATOR
Nicole, maybe you’ll change your
mind once you hear Charlie’s.
NICOLE
(looking at him now)
I don’t want to hear Charlie’s.
CHARLIE
We promised to listen.
MEDIATOR
That’s right, that’s the very
first step in this process.
Nicole stands up, suddenly furious.

11.
NICOLE
Well, I think I’ll go if you two
are just going to sit around and
suck each other’s dicks!
A hubbub of protests then:
INT. THEATER. NIGHT
Audience members watch, rapt. Nicole is on-stage in a red
dress. A black and white video of her face projected on
either side of her. On stage, she delivers her lines in an
almost life-less way while the video Nicole is very
animated and emotional.
Charlie sits in the back of the theatre--she can’t see his
face, but she knows where he is.
She continues speaking, looking into the audience when
several bodies approach her, turn her to her side and carry
her off like a stiff rolled-up rug.
Charlie sees her looking and is sad and disturbed and stops
writing his notes for a moment.
Behind her, a portal opens up, the stage is awash in red
light and the company members carry her through the door.
INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT
Closing night party. The whole company is there
celebrating, this is clearly their spot. There’s a piano,
and names are pulled from a bowl and people take turns
singing. Investors mingle as well, notable for the
disobedient air of people who shouldn’t be “downtown.”
A woman, 30’s, Mary Ann, also the stage manager (we saw her
earlier in rehearsals), sits in a booth with the costume
designer, Donna, 40’s. She looks over at Charlie in a
booth in the corner, surrounded by members of the troupe.
He works on a beer and makes more notes in a book.
MARY ANN
Do you think I can go over there
now?
Donna, turns and we SWING OVER to: Nicole, on the other
side of the room at a table flanked by other members of the
cast and crew.
Not yet.

DONNA

12.
On Charlie’s end of the room, Frank, an older actor,
carries on with Terry, a younger one.
FRANK
...Charlie gave me the note - but
it’s really for you: he told me to
pick up my cues.
TERRY
How is that for me?
FRANK
Acting is reacting - I’m
responding to you and you’re
slowing ME down.
ACTOR 3
...hey, hello, Frank - it’s
closing night, you know, we’re
done?!
LIGHTING TECH
...first, no, we’re moving
to
(doing some HANDS!)
The BroadWAY-

TERRY
(also doing HANDS!)
To The BroadWAY!

FRANK
The Main Stem.
They all cheers and laugh.
ACTOR 2
...but we’ll have to restage
it anyway!

FRANK
...it’s still a good note...

ACTOR 1
...and you know Charlie, it’s
never done, he never finishes.
ACTOR 3
We NEVER FINISH!
ACTOR 2
Love you, Charlie.
They all laugh, but they’re excited, it’s big. Charlie,
still looking at his notes, reaches out and pats the
actor’s leg affectionately. Terry, gets up-TERRY
I need a cigarette.

13.
--and makes his way across the room passing other company
members and snippets of conversation.
BETH
(dramatically)
...that’s why it seems wrong to
take over for Nicole - the role is
hers! And what if her pilot
doesn’t go, she’ll come back from
LA and want the part back, right?
ACTOR 3
No, she’s done with it.

BETH
Something like 100 percent
of pilots don’t get picked
up.

ACTOR 4
It can’t be 100 percent. There
would never be any shows.
ACTOR 5
No, but statistically, it’s
true. The probability is
zero. It’s one of those
things.

BETH
You don’t think Charlie and
Nicole will ever get back
together?

ACTOR 3
(sadly)
No, this time it’s really over.
BETH
(to herself)
Still feels weird...
ACTOR 9
...I feel like MY parents
are splitting up.

ACTOR 7
It’s always been “Charlie
and Nicole.” It just
doesn’t sound right any
other way.

ACTOR 3
Poor Henry.
Terry passes Mary Ann and Donna who still watch Charlie.
MARY ANN
(re: Charlie)
How about now?
DONNA
I’d wait, honey.
Terry arrives at the booth at the other end of the room
where Nicole and her group are camped together.

14.
ANOTHER ACTOR
(shaking her head)
He still giving notes?
Yep.

TERRY
SET DESIGNER
(to Nicole)
You’re lucky, Nic, I wish I was
going to LA. You can have space
in LA. There’s no SPACE here.
Nicole looks across the restaurant and catches Charlie’s
eye. He mouths “hi” and she nods. Is it nice?

Now?

MARY ANN
(growing more impatient)
DONNA
Don’t do it.
Frank stands and makes a toast to Charlie and Nicole and
the move to Broadway (”The Main Stem”) and how much they’ll
miss Nicole and then makes it about him returning to
Broadway with the young turks. In 1968, he was the young
turk.
FRANK
Winning your first Tony at 27-which I did--messes with your
head. I was just a baby! Elia
Kazan came backstage on opening
night elbowing Mike Nichols into a
corner. Mike, who I later turned
down twice, a big regret of
mine...
During the speech, Mary Ann, the stage manager, suddenly
rises (we can see Donna making protestations) and makes her
approach to Charlie’s corner, whispering something in his
ear.
MARY ANN
I wanted to make sure that I have
all your notes down so I can
compile them into the master list
for when we move into the new
theater...
Nicole, clocking this, abruptly stands.
rise and does the same.

Charlie sees her

15.
INT. Q TRAIN SUBWAY
Riding home across the Manhattan Bridge. Nicole sits on
the mostly empty bench gazing out the window.
Although there are available seats, Charlie stands and
leans against the doors.
INT. CHARLIE AND NICOLE’S APARTMENT. NIGHT
She and Charlie enter and relieve a young babysitter who
for some reason is buttoning her pants up and looks a
little ashamed.
BABYSITTER
Oh hey, I didn’t expect you guys
until late.
NICOLE
How’s he doing?
BABYSITTER
Good, good. He went to bed on
time, no fuss. I read him some of
Cricket in Times Square...
(takes them in)
God, you guys are so attractive.
(hand to mouth)
Shit, sorry. I didn’t stop that
from being said.
Nicole goes back and checks on Henry-CHARLIE (O.S.)
Ha! No it’s okay. I’ll pay
you for the whole time, we
decided to come home early.

BABYSITTER (O.S.)
Hey, thanks! And also the
travel time to Greenpoint--

She stumbles on something. It’s his little suitcase, open
on the floor--toys crammed into it. He’s sleeping soundly,
all twisted up in his superhero sheets. He uses a wellworn white bear as a pillow. She fixes his sheets.
The Babysitter is gone and Charlie is setting up the couch
as his bed. He surveys the room while he reflexively
fiddles with a small X-Acto knife on his key chain. We CUT
QUICKLY between objects (the clicking sound of the knife as
a soundtrack): Books, a chair, table, lamp, a TV which
turns on, painting, photos... Objects from their life
together. (Mugs of tea rest beside some of these objects.)
A book on a table.

16.
Nicole retrieves the book and heads back to the bedroom.
Charlie’s voice stops her:
CHARLIE
It’s not always going to be like
this, it’s going to get better.
Nicole nods.
CHARLIE
If you don’t like that mediator,
we’ll find another one-Yeah...

NICOLE

CHARLIE
We might not need a
mediator, we’ll just split
everything anyway, I don’t
care--

NICOLE
Me neither--

CHARLIE
You can have most of it.

CHARLIE
We’ll get apartments near
each other, make it easier
for Henry--

Right.

CHARLIE
We’ll figure it out.
same things.
Nicole meets Charlie’s eye.

NICOLE

We want the

He hesitates.

CHARLIE
In the meantime, the pilot will be
fun for you.
NICOLE
You don’t think it’s bad, do you?
CHARLIE
(hesitates)
I don’t ever watch TV so, you
know, I can’t tell...
Nicole glances over at the TV which is on.
Uh huh.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
I told Henry I’ll come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

17.
Nicole nods. Charlie looks down at his notebook.
back up at Nicole.
Yes?
Nothing.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
Nicole turns, and then turns back.
NICOLE
I can tell you want to give me a
note.
CHARLIE
No, I don’t... Yeah, I mean, yes I
do. But I guess, I guess it
doesn’t matter now. You won’t be
with the show anymore. It’s
stupid.
NICOLE
(knowing him well)
You’re not going to be able to go
to sleep until you tell me.
CHARLIE
Maybe not.
NICOLE
Okay then.
CHARLIE
Well, yes, okay, but just because
saying it out loud might help me
remember it for later.
Sure.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
(reading)
So - there were two things I thought your posture at
the top of scene seven was
still too dignified...

--okay--

NICOLE

CHARLIE
--and then at the end, I could
tell that you were pushing for the
emotion--

Looks

18.
NICOLE
--you know I can’t cry on stage
and I know you don’t like when I
fake it, but I thought maybe it
would come tonight. But it
didn’t...
He flips through the notebook.
CHARLIE
That’s all I had.
indulging me.

Silence.

Thanks for

NICOLE
Goodnight Charlie.
She starts crying as soon as she turns away from him. We
MOVE with her as she cries through the apartment to their
bedroom. She trips briefly on one of her suitcases also
lying on the floor open and half-packed. She removes her
shoes, but not her clothes, and gets into bed, crying.
Fade to Black.
A curtain flies open revealing a rich blue sky and swaying
palm trees. The light is painfully bright. We hear a
female voice lightly singing:
VOICE
“This is the day, this is the
day...”
INT. NICOLE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES. MORNING
Nicole opens her eyes which are crusted with mascara and
tears. Her mother, Sandra, 60’s, violently opens the
curtains, loudly closes drawers and doors.
We’re in LA.
SANDRA
(singing)
“That the Lord has made, that the
Lord has made...”
Nicole rolls over.
bed.

Henry, yawning, lies next to her in the

SANDRA
(singing)
“Let us rejoice, let us rejoice.
And be glad in it and be glad in
it...”

19.
This is her childhood bedroom in her mom’s house. There
are old magazines (Cosmo, Seventeen, Teen Vogue, Maxim)
with photos of Nicole. An MTV Best Kiss award. There is
“Teenage Nicole” and “Adult Nicole” all mashed up together,
and both Nicole’s are messy.
Nicole presses her face into the pillow.
Mom...

NICOLE

HENRY
(tired)
G-ma summer is for relaxing.

SANDRA
(to Henry)
You can’t make home too nice,
otherwise your children will never
leave-Nicole whispers to Henry.
NICOLE
What do you want to do today?
HENRY
Hang out and relax with you.

NICOLE
(nuzzling him)
Me too.

SANDRA
(listening in)
No relaxing! Nicole has a hair
and make-up test and Henry, we got
you into Fairy Camp with the
cousins.
HENRY
I hate Fairy Camp.
SANDRA
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy
Camp and I think this is true.
Sandra kisses Henry on the head.
SANDRA
Henry, go make your mom some
coffee like I taught you-HENRY
Mom, wait till you taste my
coffee.
Henry walks off, hair sticking up. Sandra fluffs the
pillows, retrieving Henry’s white bear.

20.
SANDRA
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?
NICOLE
It’s just for now, while we go
through this transition. Shit,
don’t tell Charlie when he gets
here -- he hates co-sleeping.
Nicole climbs out of bed.
eye make-up.

Her pillow is stained with black

SANDRA
Well, I have to say, I agree with
Charlie.
NICOLE
Surprise, surprise.
Nicole walks toward the bathroom, Sandra behind her-SANDRA
It’s as if you’ve exploded
into this room.

NICOLE
(looking at her phone)
Jesus, it’s early.

--and into the bathroom, her mother follows her inside.
NICOLE
I can do this part alone?
SANDRA
That’s fine. I won’t look.
Sandra leans against the sink, Nicole shrugs and lets her how can she stop her now?
SANDRA
As long as you’re in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 AM. And until
you know what you want to do,
we’re going to do what I like to
do.
NICOLE
I can’t just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to
do.
Nicole finishes, flushes and starts washing her hands.

21.
SANDRA
Even though I’m sixty-four and
have a dead gay husband, I manage
to get up everyday and live my
life and feel pretty good about
myself so maybe your Mom knows a
thing or two.
Nicole heads out of the room and down the main staircase.
Her mom following her, of course.
SANDRA
You know what I would do?

NICOLE
(no idea)
About what?

SANDRA
When Charlie gets here, I would
whisk him off to Palm Springs?
That’s what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump-NICOLE
Didn’t you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm
Springs?

SANDRA
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

NICOLE
Charlie and I are getting a
divorce, Mom. There’s nothing for
us in Palm Springs.
SANDRA
(suddenly angry)
YOU NEED TO WASH YOUR FACE BEFORE
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
They both enter the kitchen. Henry has made a giant mess
with the coffee, and he’s trying to press down on a French
Press coffee maker.
HENRY
When Daddy gets here maybe we can
all go on the Jaws ride-Yeah--

NICOLE

HENRY
(accommodating)
Or I can go once with you
and once with Daddy because
I wouldn’t mind going twice
anyway--

22.
SANDRA
(to Henry)
Did you know Universal
Studios is where I did my
first screen test--

NICOLE
No, we’ll all go together,
sweetheart.

Henry presents his mom a cup of coffee.
NICOLE
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it
and I started to think it’s just
bad.
SANDRA
My agent says it’s “one to watch.”
She sips her coffee.
NICOLE
(to Henry)
This coffee IS good. Thank you.
(to Sandra)
What if Charlie’s on Broadway with
the play I brought him--which I
originated and I’m just doing bad
TV.
SANDRA
It doesn’t matter. Everyone is
only impressed when they see
someone on TV.
INT/EXT. TV STUDIO. DAY
FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
She’s beautiful.
Nicole is standing in front of a camera in a
hair/makeup/wardrobe test. She’s barefoot in a nightgown
with some kind of red mask being applied to her face. We
hear voices (that she can’t) murmuring near the monitor.
Nicole holds what looks like a blue, foam football and
stares combatively at the camera. Hands enter frame,
adjusting her hair, swapping out the masks.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Where’s she been for the past ten
years?
MALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
Doing weird theater in New
York.

FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
She looks great.

23.
NICOLE
Can I say something?
No one answers. We hear bits of side-conversations about a
book club book they’re all reading.
MALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
Downtown shit. I saw one. It
rained on stage.
DP (O.S.)
Plays make me uncomfortable.

MALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
It was good. Edgy.
Directed by her husband.
Supposedly very controlling.

DP (O.S.)
The live aspect--

FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
We’re lucky to have her.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
I’m surprised she said yes.

FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
We can thank her divorce.

EFFECTS GUY (O.S.)
Can she move her hand? It’s going
to be hard to roto the hair in on
the baby around her fingers-MALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
(aloud to Nicole)
Can you move your hand further
down the baby?
NICOLE
What do you mean?
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Off his head entirely--

Like down here?
NICOLE
I’d need to support his
head.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
No, no, support the head, of
course, just try to do it from the
shoulders?
She hesitantly slides her hand down the blue football.
Perfect.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
NICOLE
I can’t hold a baby like this.

24.
FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
She’s right, that’s going to
look weird.

EFFECTS GUY (O.S.)
Just so you know, we can
TOTALLY do it, it’s just
going to take time and money
and mean less hair.

A handsome, bearded and tatted grip, 30’s, Pablo, enters
frame with a white bounce board, holding it up to her.
GRIP
So we can see your pretty face.
And not ours.
NICOLE
Ha. You should have seen me
before the plants invaded.
GRIP
I say that with respect. I
was raised by two mothers.

DP (O.S.)
(not amused)
Can you lower the board
please, Pablo?

The grip lowers the bounce board then raises it directly in
front of Nicole’s face, then lowers it, being cute.
GRIP
How ‘bout here?

Here?
Nicole smiles.
another.

A hand removes her mask and applies

GRIP
How about now?

MALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
Why is there always a flirty
grip.

Pablo finally places the board in the proper position.
GRIP
(to the DP off-camera)
That better, boss?

MAKE-UP ARTIST (O.S.)
I can do ANYTHING you want,
but we’ll need to have her
two hours before call every
day we work with the plants--

Someone walks through the shot carrying an enormous plant
arm.
NICOLE
(louder)
Can I say something?
FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
Hold on.
(to Nicole)
What honey?

25.
NICOLE
She has to know how to hold a
baby. Later after she kills
Donny, she becomes this sort of
earth mother for the plant
community and that won’t make
sense if we think she’s a bad
mother to her own kid.
MAKE-UP ARTIST (O.S.)
She kills Donny?

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
That’s a secret. We didn’t
give the crew those pages.

NICOLE
You don’t want her to appear
unsympathetic this early in the
show, do you?
MAKE-UP ARTIST (O.S.)
Does Donny know?

FEMALE PRODUCER (O.S.)
She’s right.

NICOLE
Also, why does she kill Donny
anyway?
INT./EXT. SOUNDSTAGE. LATER
Nicole marches across the soundstage, still in the
nightgown, now wearing Uggs, followed by the male (Dennis)
and female (Carol) producers, both 50’s. He wears all
denim. She’s in fitted jeans, and a white blazer. There’s
also a cadre of hair and make-up and wardrobe people.
MALE PRODUCER
Must be nice to get out of New
York. Our daughter, Mia is at NYU
living in a shoe box-NICOLE
Well, I’m from out here--

MALE PRODUCER
She’s says it went up to a
hundred and four the other
day--

FEMALE PRODUCER
We’re just so excited to
have you.

NICOLE
(nods)
I’m excited to be here --

MALE PRODUCER
We’re going for an early aughts
aesthetic — so having your
presence nails that.
MAKE-UP ARTIST
What signifies early aughts?

26.
They go outside, the bright LA light hitting their eyes.
Everyone puts on sunglasses.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Into The Girl was on TV-NICOLE
(correcting her)
All Over--

Carol--

MALE PRODUCER

FEMALE PRODUCER
--or streaming or something
and you are fucking HOT in
that movie.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Fuck it, I speak my mind!

MALE PRODUCER
We’re not allowing our son to see
it.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Because you show your tits.
Carol--

MALE PRODUCER
Yeah.

NICOLE

MALE PRODUCER
This is Carter Mitchum, he’s a
futurist at UCLA who’s consulting
on all the environmental stuff for
the show.
Carter, 30’s, has been politely following behind.
reaches forward to shake her hand.

He

MALE PRODUCER
You know, so it’s accurate.
CARTER
Nice to meet you.
What?

CARTER

So, is it?
Accurate?

NICOLE
NICOLE

CARTER
So far none of it.
Nicole laughs. She’s handed another nightgown by the
wardrobe assistant. “For when you’re on the mother ship.”
MALE PRODUCER
This pilot WILL go. Get ready to
move back to LA!

27.
FEMALE PRODUCER
And listen: everything you were
saying back there was absolutely
right-MALE PRODUCER
Except no one knows we’re
killing Donny. Including
Donny.

FEMALE PRODUCER
If she’s a bad mom, we’ll
lose the audience.

NICOLE
Oh...good, you know, I just
thoughtFEMALE PRODUCER
Let us know if you’d like to be
part of our writer’s room -- I bet
you’d be really helpful.
NICOLE
(surprises herself even)
Or I could direct? Sorry, maybe
that sounds crazy.
FEMALE PRODUCER
No, yeah... Do you have a reel?
NICOLE
No, because I’ve never done it. I
mean, I watched my husband do it
for years...
(quietly)
Almost ex-husband? What’s the
opposite of fiance?
FEMALE PRODUCER
(taking her in)
We’ll talk to your agents about
it.
NICOLE
At our theater, I always wanted to
direct and Charlie would say
something like “The next one!”
But he was always the director and
there never was a next one.
(contradicting herself)
But I don’t know, maybe there
would have been if we stayed
married. You know, I don’t know.
Nicole turns away, embarrassed. The Female Producer has
been watching her, while the Male Producer is just texting
like a motherfucker.

28.
INT. NICOLE’S TRAILER
Nicole enters the cramped space and realizes the Female
Producer is right behind her. Nicole tries to busy
herself.
FEMALE PRODUCER
(takes out her phone)
I’m going to give you a number.
NICOLE
Oh...OK. Is it a therapist? I
have a therapist. Well, she’s my
mom’s therapist. We share her.
FEMALE PRODUCER
She’s a lawyer, she represented me
when I left Dennis.
NICOLE
(re: the male producer)
You and Dennis are divorced?

FEMALE PRODUCER
Since 2013.

NICOLE
And you still work together?
That’s nice.
FEMALE PRODUCER
Oh, no, he’s a fucking cocksucker.
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.
NICOLE
We talked about doing it without
lawyers.
FEMALE PRODUCER
You think that, but you
won’t...

NICOLE
My sister made me meet a
bunch of them already, I
just HATED them.

FEMALE PRODUCER
(with certitude)
Call Nora. She saved my life.
NORA (V.O.)
I’m sorry I look so schleppy.
INT. NORA FANSHAW’S OFFICE. DAY
Nora Fanshaw, 40’s, looks amazing and elegant. Today she
is in tight designer jeans, a YSL blazer, red pumps and
full make-up.

29.
Nicole, in old jeans and a button-down, sits on a
comfortable, stylish couch, a Moroccan rug on the floor--in
an office that looks like a suite at a W Hotel. A
sheepskin throw, fresh flowers on the coffee table.
NORA
I had an event at my kid’s school.
Nicole grows suddenly self-conscious about what she’s
wearing.
NORA
Let me get this out of the way, I
think you’re a wonderful actress.
NICOLE
Thank you.
NORA
I loved All Over The Girl but the
theater stuff too.
NICOLE
(can’t help but be
pleased)
You’ve seen the theater
stuff?

NORA
I saw Electra.

NORA
I was in New York last year for my
book -- which, remind me to give
you a copy -- and my publisher
took me.
Oh...great.

NICOLE
Thank you.

Fantastic.

NORA
You’re awesome.

NICOLE
(almost apologetically)
Charlie directed it.
I know.

NORA
He’s very talented.

NICOLE
He is. They’re moving it to
Broadway. Without me of course.
NORA
He was lucky to have you.

NICOLE
While I’m making a show
about a plant invasion.

30.
NORA
(really asking the
question)
How are you doing?
Having been asked that question at that moment in that way,
does something to her. Tears run down Nicole’s cheeks.
NORA
Oh, honey.
Nora kicks off her shoes and tucks them under her feet.
She rises, grabs a box of tissues and curls up next to
Nicole on the couch.
Nicole takes a tissue and she and Nora meet eyes.
intimate and safe.

It feels

NORA
You take some breaths. And while
you do, I’m going to tell you
about myself.
She texts something to someone and then very deliberately
puts her phone down on the table. Nora puts her hand on
Nicole’s leg. She talks to her like a good girlfriend.
NORA
If you should choose to hire me, I
will work tirelessly for you and
am always available by phone or
text, EXCEPT when I’m with my
kids. I insist on doing drop-off
and pick-up at school every day.
NICOLE
(likes this)
Oh, I understand.
An assistant enters with a tray that has green tea and
cookies. Nicole starts eating the cookies, Nora does not.
NORA
I’ve been through this myself so I
know how it feels.
NICOLE
(hopeful)
You do?

NORA
Yes. I have a kid from my
ex who was a narcissistic
artist and verbally abusive.
I’m now with a great
boyfriend, who lives in
Malibu.

31.
NICOLE
Oh, good.
(hesitates)
But Charlie’s not terrible.
NORA
No, of course not, but they ravish
you with attention in the
beginning and then once we have
babies, we become the mom and they
get sick of us.
Nicole nods.
NORA
Where do you want live now, doll?
NICOLE
(takes a breath)
Well, I’m here now, obviously, and
I don’t know if this show will be
picked up, but... it feels like
home... it is home. It’s the only
home I’ve known without Charlie.
NORA
You want to stay here.
Nicole likes hearing this affirmation, but then hesitates.
NICOLE
Charlie won’t want to do that.
hates LA.

He

NORA
We’re interested in what YOU want
to do. Sounds to me like you did
your time in New York. He can do
some time here, no?
NICOLE
(nods)
He always said we would, but we
never did.
NORA
How old is your son?
NICOLE
Henry is eight. He likes LA, but
I don’t know if it’s fair to
him...

32.
NORA
It sounds like a wonderful
childhood to me: the first half
New York and the second half in
LA.
NICOLE
(to herself)
The second half...
Nicole processes this.
NORA
I want you to listen to me, what
you’re doing is an act of HOPE.
Do you understand that?
NICOLE
(suddenly meaning it)
Yes.
I do.

NICOLE

NICOLE
I don’t know.

NORA
You’re saying, I want
something better for myself.
NORA
And this, right now, is the
worst time. It will only
get better. Wasn’t it Tom
Petty who said the waiting
is the hardest part?
NORA
I represented his wife in
their divorce, I got her
half of that song.

NICOLE
Oh, I don’t want money or
anything, he doesn’t have money
anyway, he puts it all back into
the theater-- I used to think he
gave TOO much away. I just want
it to be over.
NORA
Of course you do.
both.

But we can do

NICOLE
I just worry... You know we
weren’t going to even use lawyers
so...I don’t want to be too
aggressive. I’d like to stay
friends.

33.
NORA
Don’t worry, we’ll do it as gently
as possible.
(beat)
Now, can you tell me a little bit
more about what’s going on?
Because part of what we’re going
to do together is tell your STORY.
Nicole wipes her eyes for the millionth time. She stands
and grabs a tissue from the table. She takes a deep
breath.
NICOLE
It’s difficult to articulate.
Sorry. It’s like I know why I’m
doing this but I don’t know too.
It’s not as simple as not being in
love anymore.
NORA (O.S.)
I understand. Why don’t you start
at the beginning, wherever that is
for you.
And Nicole begins. As she talks she finds her voice and
gains momentum and she starts to feel better, the tears
start to dry up and she becomes more powerful, more
herself.
NICOLE
Well, I was engaged to Ben, you
know, and living in LA and I felt
like “Yes, I want to make movies
and marry Ben” - Jesus I was only
nineteen or twenty, I’ve never
felt older in my whole life - But
if I was honest with myself, there
was a small part of me that felt
dead, or dead-ish, but you tell
yourself “no one is perfect, no
relationship is perfect.”
(realizing)
Boy, this tea is delicious.
Isn’t it?

NORA
It’s the Manuka honey.

NICOLE
Anyway, you were asking about
Charlie. So yes, so I was happy
with Ben, but aware of the
deadness.
(MORE)

34.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
And then I went to New York to
meet a director for a space movie,
but one where they take space
seriously. Sex trafficking in
space. It was political, or they
wanted us to think it was. It was
actually just fulfilling the same
need certain fucked up porn does.
Anyway, while I was there, the
producer invited me to a play. It
was in someone’s living room with
all the lights on and like nothing
I’d ever seen before. A strange,
surreal dystopian story. So well
acted and one of the actors was
this big shaggy bear who played
all his lines looking directly at
me which I knew couldn’t be really
the case, but it felt that way,
and of course later I learned that
it was.
(also realizing)
The cookies are really great too.
NORA (O.S.)
I’ll give you some to take home.
NICOLE
Afterwards, I was introduced to the
cast and this bear turned out to
also be the director. He didn’t
really know who I was - or he did,
or he figured it out later - and
that was it. He started talking to
me. And I talked back - and the
dead part wasn’t dead, it was just
in a coma. And it was better than
sex, the talking. Although the sex
was also like the talking...
everything is like everything in a
relationship, do you find that? ...
We spent the whole night and next
day together, and I just... never
left. And to be honest, all the
problems were there in the
beginning, too. I just went along
with him in his life because it
felt so damn good to feel myself
alive. In the beginning I was the
actress, the star, so that felt
like something. People came to see
me, at first.
(MORE)

35.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
But then the farther away I got
from that and the more the theatre
company got acclaim, I had less and
less weight. I became “Who?” “Oh
you remember, that actress who was
in that thing that time.” And he
was the draw. And that would have
been fine, but...I got smaller. I
realized that I didn’t really ever
come alive for myself, I was just
feeding his aliveness. He was so
smart and creative, it didn’t
matter. I would tell him things at
home, in private, and then they
would work their way into public
conversation, into his work and for
a while that felt like enough. I
was just so flattered that someone
like him would find an idea of mine
worth using or a comment of mine
worth repeating. And then I got
pregnant. And I thought “having a
baby will be ours, really ours, and
it will also really be mine” and he
was so excited. And it was nice for
a while. But kids... they belong to
themselves. Like the instant they
leave your body, it’s just a
process of going away from you. And
I didn’t belong to myself. It was
stupid stuff and big stuff-- All
of the furniture in our house was
his taste. I wasn’t even sure what
my taste was anymore because I’d
never been asked to use it. I
didn’t even pick our apartment, I
just moved into his. I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA,
but it came to nothing. We’d come
here on holidays because he liked
my family, but whenever I suggested
we do a year or something, he’d put
me off. It would be so weird if he
had turned to me and said “And what
do you want to do today?” I watched
that long documentary about George
Harrison and I thought “just own
it, own it like George Harrison’s
wife. Being a wife and mother is
enough.” And then I realized I
couldn’t remember her name.
(MORE)

36.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
So this pilot came along, and it
shot in LA and it paid so much and
it was like there was a little lifeline thrown to me “Here is a bit of
earth that’s yours.” And I was
embarrassed about it in front of
him, but also, it felt like “this
is who I am, this is what I’m worth
and it’s stupid, but at least it’s
mine.” And if he had taken me in a
big hug and said “Baby, I’m so
excited for your adventure and of
course I want you to have your own
piece of earth” then we might not
be getting divorced. But he made
fun of it. And was jealous, like he
is. BUT then he realized about the
money and told me I could funnel it
back into the theatre company. And
that’s when I realized that he
truly didn’t see me. He didn’t see
me as something separate from him.
And I asked him to say my phone
number. And he didn’t know it. So I
left.
Nora wipes a ink-stained tear from Nicole’s cheek and hugs
her.
NICOLE
(realizing she forgot to
include)
I think Charlie also slept with
Mary Ann, the stage manager.
NORA
(fierce)
That fucking asshole.
INT. SANDRA’S HOUSE, LOS ANGELES. EVENING
Cassie husband, Sam and their kids, Jules and Molly, play
Monopoly with Henry in the den. Henry has trouble reading
the Chance card. Sam helps him with it.
JULES
You should buy everything.
HENRY
But I want to keep my money.

37.
INT. SANDRA’S KITCHEN. SAME
CLOSE on a manilla envelope with Charlie’s name on it and
Nora’s firm’s address in the corner. Cassie, 30’s, Nicole
and Sandra are preparing. They’re all drinking wine and
drinking it too fast.
NICOLE
So, Cassie, you’re going to hand
him the envelope-CASSIE
Why do I have to do it?
SANDRA
Because Nicole is very good at
getting people to do things for
her-NICOLE
That’s not what this is--

SANDRA
I wiped her butt until she
was nine years old. She’s
very seductive that way.

NICOLE
No. Mom. Legally I can’t be the
one who serves him.
SANDRA
But still this is true what
I’m saying.

CASSIE
(nervous now)
Do I have to actually hand
him the envelope?

NICOLE
Yes, but I’m going to tell him in
advance that they’re divorce
papers. Nora says it doesn’t have
to be so formal.
(suddenly nervous)
Where’s Henry?
Nicole finishes what’s in her glass and pours herself more.
CASSIE
He’s in the living room playing
with Jules and Molly.
NICOLE
Let’s get them upstairs. So, I’ll
tell Charlie what’s happening and
Cassie, you can then hand him the
envelope--

38.
CASSIE
OK, I just get nervous--

SANDRA
(nervously)
Can you un-serve?

NICOLE
What do you mean, like take it
back?
Yeah.

SANDRA
NICOLE
(getting anxious)
I think so.
CASSIE
You should check.

SANDRA
In case we change our minds.

NICOLE
I’m not going to change my mind.
CASSIE
I know, but maybe just to
know in case I do something
wrong--

SANDRA
Or we all just feel too bad
for him.

NICOLE
Now you’re both just making ME
feel bad about it, OK.
Sorry...
nervous.

CASSIE
Sorry. I’m

We all are.
Charlie.

SANDRA
And we LOVE

NICOLE
(with more power now)
You have to STOP loving him, Mom.
You can’t be his friend anymore.
SANDRA
Charlie and I have our own
relationship independent of your
marriage just like I’m friends
with Cassie’s ex, Jeff-CASSIE
(news to her)
Are you still seeing Jeff?!
SANDRA
(shrugs)
An occasional lunch.

39.
CASSIE
I can’t believe you!

SANDRA
He still wants his camera
back by the way.

NICOLE
(getting emotional, but
staying strong)
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now. I
can’t believe I have to explain
this to you. Just be on MY side,
OK?
OK.

SANDRA
CASSIE
And stop seeing JEFF!
NICOLE
Cassie, you’re the server.
CASSIE
Just let me practice a few times.
I was never a good auditioner.
SANDRA
You wanted it too badly.
NICOLE
It’s not an audition.
SANDRA
I’ll play Charlie.

CASSIE
It’s just my palms are so
perspired.

SANDRA
Sweetie, you’re blotting the
envelope. Maybe Nicole should
play you.
CASSIE
Did you really just say that???
NICOLE
We don’t need to practice it.
It’s not a performance!
Sandra is working on opening a bottle of wine.
NICOLE
Did we finish the other one
already?

40.
CASSIE
(with dead certainty)
Oh, yeah.
Outside, a car door closes, they all jump.
screams. Nicole snaps into action.

Cassie even

NICOLE
OK, let me get it. You both go in
the other room. Cassie, make sure
Henry goes upstairs with Jules and
Molly.
CASSIE
Happening now.
Cassie and Sandra disperse. Nicole goes to the door.
Sandra reappears from another entrance.
NICOLE
Mom!
SANDRA
I’m getting my wine.
She grabs her glass and scurries away as Cassie reenters.
What?!

NICOLE
CASSIE
Henry’s pooping in the bathroom
downstairs.
NICOLE
Can we transfer him to the
upstairs one?
CASSIE
I think it’s mid-poop.
NICOLE
OK, grab him when he comes out.
(Cassie nods and starts
to leave)
Cassie!
What?!

CASSIE
NICOLE

document)

NICOLE (CONT'D)
I’m putting the envelope here by
the toaster.
Copy you.

CASSIE
Cassie hurries out of the room. The back door opens,
Charlie enters in a whirl. He kisses Nicole on the lips,
heading into a spare bedroom.
Hey--

CHARLIE
Where’s Henry?

NICOLE
He’s pooping.
Hi Henry!

CHARLIE
He dumps his bags on the floor.

She watches through the

CHARLIE (O.S.)
Does this couch still open?
He reappears, squeezing past her into the kitchen.
CHARLIE
(excited)
I got off the plane to a text-But don’t tell anyone yet, it’s
still a secret.
OK--

NICOLE
He goes straight to the refrigerator, passing the manila
envelope next to the toaster. He turns to Nicole, unable
to contain his excitement.
CHARLIE
I won a MacArthur grant.
NICOLE
Oh, Charlie, that’s so great.
Congratulations!
She hugs him, truly happy for him.
Thanks.

CHARLIE

NICOLE
(so pleased)
I’ll say it because you
can’t, it’s the genius
grant. You’re a genius.

42.
CHARLIE
(bashful, but beaming)
Well...

NICOLE
I’m really happy for you.
You deserve it--

CHARLIE
It’s yours too. We did all of
this together.
NICOLE
Well, thank you, but it’s yours,
Charlie, enjoy it.
CHARLIE
I’m starving-Charlie removes a roasted chicken from the refrigerator.
CHARLIE
It’s good money, and they parse it
out over five years, but it means
I can keep everyone in the theater
company employed, pay my credit
card debt and-NICOLE
(eyes on the envelope)
It’s so great.
CHARLIE
Of course I went instantly to,
“it’s all down hill from here.”
Now my first Broadway play HAS to
fail-No!

NICOLE
CHARLIE
We just started rehearsals
again...I don’t know...

Do I?

NICOLE
You always don’t know at
this point and then it gets
there--

CHARLIE
Cause I don’t remember.

NICOLE
I know, but it’s true.

It’ll be

CHARLIE
(smiles)
OK. I hope you’re right.
Everyone says, Hi.

NICOLE
Tell them Hi. I miss everyone.
CHARLIE
Well, you’ll see them when
you come back--

NICOLE
A MacArthur, Broadway, it’s
so exciting.
Congratulations, Charlie.

He picks at the chicken with his hands, licking his
fingers. Nicole takes a breath, wanting to acknowledge the
envelope sitting now to Charlie’s right and all that’s
about to happen.
CHARLIE
Which bathroom?
What?

NICOLE

CHARLIE
Is he pooping?

NICOLE
Oh...downstairs.
He starts off.

She follows him into the other room.

CHARLIE
Your mom home?
NICOLE
Yeah, she’s upstairs-He knocks on the bathroom door.
CHARLIE
Hey, how’s it going?
HENRY (O.S.)
Nothing yet.
It’s me.
I know.

CHARLIE
HENRY (O.S.)
CHARLIE
I just got here.
Hi.

HENRY (O.S.)
CHARLIE
I brought you something.

Mom is giving me a present

HENRY (O.S.)
For pooping.
CHARLIE
Oh...
(pause)
I love you.
HENRY (O.S.)
I love you.
Charlie reenters the kitchen.

Nicole trailing.

CHARLIE
I don’t think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.
NICOLE
I know, but he holds it in,
it’s getting on a week...

CHARLIE
It’s its own reward.

Sandra pokes her head in.
SANDRA
Hey there, Charlie-bird.
CHARLIE
(smiling)
G-ma!
Sandra kisses him on the lips.
watches impatiently.

He lifts her up.

Nicole

SANDRA
Don’t, I’m so heavy!
CHARLIE
You’re light as a feather.
SANDRA
Oh, God, I’m so HUGE!

CHARLIE
You didn’t respond to my
last email!

SANDRA
Your emails are so articulate, I
get intimidated!

45.
NICOLE
Mom, can you help with--

SANDRA
Now, I’m going to lift YOU!

She wraps her arms around him and he pretends to be lifted.
MOM!

NICOLE
SANDRA
What?

Upstairs--

NICOLE

SANDRA
Oh...
(to Charlie)
I’m going to go write you back
now.
Sandra reluctantly leaves as Cassie enters.
CASSIE
Hey, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Cassie, I like your haircut.

CASSIE
(disarmed)
Oh, thanks.
Mom!

HENRY (O.S.)
SANDRA (O.S.)
Henry’s calling you, Nicole!
I hear him!

NICOLE

CHARLIE
What’s going on, Henry?!

HENRY (O.S.)
Can you have Mom come?
CHARLIE
He wants you-Nicole and Cassie look at one another.
NICOLE
(mouths)
Wait for me-Charlie continues to eat (and mangle) his chicken. Cassie
stands in front of him awkwardly. She collects her things,
holds a pie tin, on top of a script. She’s red faced and
blushing, and shaking from nerves.
CHARLIE
What kind of pie is that?

46.
CASSIE
(for some reason that
stumped her)
It’s...
(long pause, as if trying
to recall a line in a
play)
Pecan.
CHARLIE
Did you make it?
CASSIE
I don’t know. No! It’s store
bought. You know Joan’s on Third?
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah, that’s good, right?
CASSIE
What? The store? Yeah!
and Molly love it.

Jules

CHARLIE
(re: her nerves)
Are you OK?
Yes.

CASSIE
I’m just HOT.

CHARLIE
I’ll pour you some water.
(he does)
Nicole says you’re doing a play?
CASSIE
(happy to be asked)
I think you’d like it! It’s a
great unproduced play by this
really interesting British writer.
CHARLIE
So you do an English accent?
CASSIE
Yeah, it’s more Northern England.
CHARLIE
Oh, what does that sound like?
CASSIE
Ya want a cup of tea, do ya?

47.
CHARLIE
Oh, right. Good.
(doing an OK English
accent)
Oh, thank you, missus. What is-Charlie’s gaze goes down to the counter. The legal
envelope lies there. Cassie sees him seeing this.
CHARLIE
What’s this?
CASSIE
(still trying British)
It’s a manilla envelope, love.
(shakes her head)
Can I start over?
CHARLIE
It has my name on it.
He picks it up. She lunges forward and violently grabs it
out of his hands. She hesitates and then formally hands it
back to him.
CASSIE
Oh Jesus, sorry.
Sorry.
Nicole reenters.

You’re served.

She sees Charlie holding the envelope.

NICOLE
(to Cassie)
What did you do?
CASSIE
Nothing. I don’t know. I can’t
lie. You’re being served. You
guys are getting divorced. I
don’t know. I’m sorry.
She runs out of the room.

Nicole looks at Charlie.

NICOLE
I was going to warn you.

Charlie stares at the envelope.
NICOLE
I’m sorry.

So it

And then:

48.
CHARLIE
(eyes on the envelope)
I feel like I’m in a dream.
NICOLE
We don’t have a marriage anymore.
Charlie looks up at her.
NICOLE
I know you don’t want the
disruption, but you don’t want to
be married. Not really.
CHARLIE
(holding up the envelope)
But I don’t want THIS.
NICOLE
Well, what did you expect was
going to happen?
CHARLIE
I don’t know... I guess I didn’t
think it through. But I thought
we agreed-Nicole gets out a bottle of whiskey and pours two drinks.
She places one on the counter in front of him.
CHARLIE
We weren’t going to use
lawyers.

NICOLE
I want a... I don’t know,
I’m trying to say this as
undramatically as possible.
I want an ENTIRELY different
kind of life.

CHARLIE
Let’s wait until you finish this
pilot and come back to New York
and... Let’s figure it out there,
at home. Together.
NICOLE
Nora is known for being
really fair-

CHARLIE
We don’t need to do this
with envelopes and...

CHARLIE
(holding up the envelope)
This is Nora?
NICOLE
Yeah. She’s great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

49.
CHARLIE
Why do I feel like that won’t
happen...
NICOLE
It’s a formality and you
don’t have to respond right
away.
NICOLE
The pie was hers.

CHARLIE
(suddenly)
Why...why did Cassie have a
pie?
The pie wasn’t

CHARLIE
Are you sure?
NICOLE
Yeah, I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?
CHARLIE
I don’t know, it somehow
makes it worse.

Sorry.

NICOLE
The pie was just a

CHARLIE
So, what... What do I do?
NICOLE
You get a lawyer too.
INT. NICOLE’S ROOM AT SANDRA’S
Charlie and Nicole lie in bed together on either side of
Henry. Charlie is reading Stuart Little. They get to the
end. Both Charlie and Nicole wipe tears from their eyes.
NICOLE
I forgot it ended that way.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Wow. Stuart really overreacted, didn’t you think?
HENRY
He was upset about his boat.
Charlie kisses Henry on the head.
HENRY
Dad, you go away--

Mom, you stay--

NICOLE
But Daddy, just got here--

50.

It’s OK.

CHARLIE
I love you.

HENRY
(picking up his Dad’s
disappointment)
But you can come back and wake me
up and read to me later, Daddy.
OK?
OK.

CHARLIE
Charlie gets up and walks outside the door.
Nicole and Henry.

We STAY with

HENRY
(whispers)
Will you come sleep in my bed
later?

Yes.

NICOLE
(whispering)
We CUT TO Charlie standing outside the door and for the
first time shift to HIS perspective. He hears their
whispers. A door squeak grabs Charlie’s attention. Sandra
peeks out from her room.
SANDRA
(whispers, shaking her
fists)
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.
CHARLIE
(whispers)
Thanks G-ma.
Sandra shuts her door. He looks at the family photos on
the hallway wall. Sandra younger on a TV show, being
directed by Roberto, a handsome curly haired man with big
glasses. Nicole and Cassie as kids.

Nicole. They pose, looking great, standing apart on the

She sees Charlie looking at the

NICOLE
He’s in a Mommy phase right now.

51.

It’s OK.

CHARLIE
They both head down the stairs. Nicole sways for a second
and clutches a bannister. Charlie takes her arm.
NICOLE
Sorry, I think I drank too much
wine-CHARLIE
I can imagine. Stressful
time.

NICOLE
And didn’t eat dinner--

NICOLE
Ha, yeah... I hope Henry didn’t
notice.
CHARLIE
I’m sure he didn’t.
NICOLE
Now that I’m a parent I realize my
parents were probably drunk all
the time with me.
Yeah.

CHARLIE

Thanks.

NICOLE
Sorry again.
CHARLIE

NICOLE
Where are you staying?
CHARLIE
Oh, um...I hadn’t...I guess
I’ll...
He puts on his jacket, and leaves the room-NICOLE
There’s a new hotel over on
Highland that’s supposedly not too
expensive and pretty nice.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Oh...OK...I’ll check it out.
NICOLE
Again, that’s great about the
MacArthur.
Charlie reappears clutching his bag.

52.

Thanks.

CHARLIE
They half-hug strangely, he holding his bag in one hand,
she holding the legal envelope.
He heads for the door.
Charlie?

NICOLE
CHARLIE
(turning hopefully)
Yeah?
Nicole hands him the envelope with the divorce papers.
Thanks.

CHARLIE
Charlie flips off all the lights in the room.
Nicole in darkness.
Fuck.

Leaving

A VOICE (V.O.)
INT. JAY MAROTTA’S LAW OFFICE. DAY
Charlie sits across from a lawyer, 50’s, a strong, husky
silver-haired man in a suit. This is Jay Marotta. The
office is nothing like Nora’s -- sleek, corporate, tough.
There are photos of Jay playing sports.
An associate, 30’s, Ted, a younger jock, sits at an
adjacent table, taking notes.
What?

CHARLIE
JAY MAROTTA
(to the associate)
She’s being represented by Nora.
Ted nods, knowingly.
CHARLIE
She’s supposedly very fair?
JAY MAROTTA
Here’s the fact Jack: I charge 950
dollars an hour, Ted is 400, so if
you have a stupid question, call
Ted.

53.
Ted smiles at Charlie.

Charlie looks sick.

JAY MAROTTA
To start we’ll need a twenty-five
thousand dollar retainer-CHARLIE
Oh, that’s more than I can-TED
And all your financials.
We’ll need to do a forensic
accounting.

JAY SILVERMAN
Which runs anywhere from ten
to twenty thousand dollars.

CHARLIE
(sweating)
But if we can all agree right
away, it shouldn’t get too bad,
right?
JAY MAROTTA
(not responding)
You were married here, in LA?
CHARLIE
Yes, because her mom and
sister are out here and I’m
not close with my family and
so we just did it here...

JAY SILVERMAN
And your son was born out
here?

CHARLIE
Yes, because again her family was
out here and I’m not-JAY MAROTTA
So you got married here, your kid
was born here and she served you
here?
CHARLIE
Yeah. But we LIVED in New York.
(pause)
Why? Is there a problem?
TED
We’re going to have to reshape the
narrative.
JAY MAROTTA
If you’re serious about having
your child in New York, this is
what I would suggest, you take the
kid, did you say his name is Fred--

54.

Henry.

CHARLIE

TED
I have a kid named Fred.

--Henry?
Fred.

JAY MAROTTA
Why did I think

JAY MAROTTA
--you take Henry to New York
with you right now. Then we
file an action in New York.
Make it a New York case--

TED
We need to make an argument that
you’re a New York based family.
CHARLIE
Well, we ARE.

JAY MAROTTA
Otherwise, you’ll probably
never see your kid outside
of LA again.

CHARLIE
(shocked)
Really? No.
JAY MAROTTA
It’s very difficult to convince
the courts to MOVE a kid. As soon
as you let your wife and child
leave New York, you made life very
difficult for yourself.
CHARLIE
Yeah, but as I said, we are a New
York family, that’s just a fact.
She’s here temporarily.
JAY MAROTTA
(leading question)
Then why do you think she served
you out here?
Jay and the associate exchange a meaningful glance.
CHARLIE
I don’t...know. But, Henry wants
to go back to New York, he tells
me-JAY MAROTTA
Don’t quote your kid. He’s just
telling you what you want to hear.
Trust me, he’s telling her the
opposite.
Jay looks back at the papers.

55.
JAY MAROTTA
What’s Exit Goat?
CHARLIE
Exit Ghost. It’s the name of my
theater company.
JAY MAROTTA
You’re a director?
CHARLIE
Theater director, yeah.

JAY MAROTTA
Anything I’ve seen?

CHARLIE
I don’t know. What have you seen?
Silence.
CHARLIE
Our production of Electra is moving to
Broadway which is exciting-JAY MAROTTA
We have to make sure that money is
protected.
CHARLIE
I mean, it’s theater, so it’s not
a lot of money. I basically put
whatever money I make back in the
theater.
JAY MAROTTA
I wonder-(looks at Ted)
Do WE ask for support?
TED
Interesting--

CHARLIE
From Nicole? I’m not going
to do that--

JAY MAROTTA
Does your wife’s family have
money?
CHARLIE
Her mother has some from her TV
career and her father died-JAY MAROTTA
We could say we don’t want
her mother to see the kid,
draw HER into the case.

TED
In that instance, her mother
could pay your legal fees
too.

56.
CHARLIE
(can’t believe his ears)
No. I’m very close to her mom.
Nicole’s family has been my familyJAY MAROTTA
That’s going to change and I
suggest you get used to that.
(to Ted)
We should hire a private
investigator-Really?

CHARLIE
I mean...REALLY?

JAY MAROTTA
We need to look for ways we
can show she’s a bad mother.

CHARLIE
But she’s not.

JAY MAROTTA
Your wife do drugs or
anything? Coke?

CHARLIE
Not in any real way-JAY MAROTTA
We’re not going to win if she’s a
perfect mom.
CHARLIE
(hesitates)
She was addicted to Tums for a
while.
Jay stares at him.
CHARLIE
It wasn’t nothing.
a tube a day.

She was up to

JAY MAROTTA
Have you noticed anyone following
YOU?
No!

CHARLIE
JAY MAROTTA
Keep an eye out. California’s a
no-fault state so even if you’re
fucking around it wouldn’t matter,
but, it doesn’t look good-(stands)
(MORE)

57.
JAY MAROTTA (CONT'D)
You need to be prepared for the
fact that Nora’s going to portray
you as a neglectful, absent,
father.
CHARLIE
But I’m not--

JAY MAROTTA
You live in New York,
consumed with your work, she
and the kid are out here,
struggling. Nora will use
that strategy, I’m sure of
it.

CHARLIE
She’s not going to LIE.
JAY MAROTTA
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable and they start from
a place of crazy when we settle,
we’ll be somewhere between
reasonable and crazy.
TED
Which is STILL crazy.
JAY MAROTTA
Half of crazy is crazy.

Uh huh.

CHARLIE

TED
You know what people say, criminal
lawyers see bad people at their
best, divorce lawyers see good
people at their worst.
JAY MAROTTA
You’ll end up hating me and Ted
before it’s all over just because
of what we represent in your life.
CHARLIE
I’m sure you’re right.
Charlie looks like he’ll pass out.
CHARLIE
Maybe I didn’t explain this
well. We’re friendly, we’re
fine, we’re just trying to
figure this out--

JAY SILVERMAN
So, tell me the story again,
you came out to see your kid
and she served you? What a
bitch.

58.
CHARLIE
She’s not a bitch...thanks, but
this isn’t...we’re doing it a
different way. And I can’t even
close afford this... I’ve got to
get back to New York. I have a
Broadway play in rehearsals-Charlie stands.
Fade to Black.
INT. BROADWAY REHEARSAL SPACE, NEW YORK. DAY
Actors are mingling, stretching, in a mostly white room in
midtown. Different color tape on the floor indicates the
set. Various conversations are going on at once including
Frank telling another anecdote from his younger days.
FRANK
She was Rosalind and I was
Jaques. Nobody knew her
then --

BETH
Do you think it’s OK that
I’m doing the laughing fit
that way. Nicole did it
more like -(she laughs strangely)
I’m doing it-(laughs her way)
And I don’t want to imitate
her--

ACTOR 3
You’re making it your own.
FRANK
Complete unknown. And I was
the hot shit you know, young
and very sexy with this
great head of hair.

BETH
I just so appreciate that
Charlie gave me this
opportunity. Or maybe I
should thank Nicole.

TERRY
I heard Nicole’s pilot went to
series so she’s staying in LA.
ACTOR 2
And they put Henry in school out
there.
ACTOR 4
Is Charlie moving there too?
Not Charlie.

BETH

ACTOR
He won’t abandon us.

59.
TERRY
And you can’t do theater in LA.
They all laugh.
ACTOR 5
Charlie said she and Henry are
coming back to New York once she
finishes filming her show.
ACTOR 1
I wouldn’t be so sure.
ACTOR 5
She was never going to stay
in New York. That was
obvious.

ACTOR 2
She was probably planning
this move all along.

ACTOR 5
When she sees an
opportunity, believe me, she
takes it.

ACTOR
Well, LA is nice.

The

FRANK
And you know it’s “The Park” and
all that, and Joey Papp was

ACTOR 3
Charlie HATES LA.
All of their attention eventually drifts toward Frank for
the big finish.
FRANK
Miss future four time Oscar winner
sucking my...
The door swings open and Charlie enters. He’s immediately
swarmed by the costume designer and props guy who is
showing him different items to approve.
Charlie puts his things down on a white folding table.
CHARLIE
Nobody come too close, I think I
got Donna’s cold.
DONNA
Sorry Charlie.
Terry and other actors approach him.

60.
CHARLIE
Just a heads up, I’m waiting for a
Skype call from Henry so I might
have to step out-Everyone very understandingly says “Of course.” “Say Hi
from us” etc. Frank puts his arm around Charlie.
FRANK
What you’re going through now is
going to be horrible. BUT it will
be over.
CHARLIE
Thanks, Frank.
Yes?

FRANK
Another thing.
CHARLIE

FRANK
Fuck as many people as you can
right now. Women, men...
The Costume Designer, Donna, holds up a brown suit, hat,
goggles and white gauze and a small Frankenstein outfit.
COSTUME DESIGNER
You might need help wrapping
some of the gauze, it needs
to stay tight.

FRANK
Take what I said seriously.

SET DESIGNER
I’m confused. What scene is the
Invisible Man outfit for?
CHARLIE
No, that’s my Halloween costume.
And the Frankenstein is for Henry.
All the actors surround him, approving of the outfits.
“Aww!” “So cute!” “Frankenstein and the Invisible Man!”
CHARLIE
He’s coming here this
weekend and we’re going to
trick or treat in the Slope
and whatever-Perfect.

CHARLIE
CHARLIE
Yeah, over--

COSTUME DESIGNER
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

MARY ANN
Can I talk to you?

61.
Charlie and Mary Ann duck into the hallway. The crew
clocks this and makes knowing eye contact with one another.
INT. REHEARSAL SPACE HALLWAY. SAME
Mary Ann hands him a stack of papers and an old scuffed up
book.
MARY ANN
I typed up the notes from the last
two rehearsals and here’s the
blueprints-CHARLIE
(pleased)
Where’d you find it?

MARY ANN
--from the original layout
of the Broadway theater--

MARY ANN
The library. Duh.
Ha!

CHARLIE
MARY ANN
(sweetly)
Can I come over tonight?
CHARLIE
(pause)
Mary Ann, it’s too hard now...I
just can’t be with anyone right
now.
MARY ANN
We did it when you were married,
when we shouldn’t have done it.
Now, that you’re not married, um,
shouldn’t we be doing it?
CHARLIE
I’m not not married...yet.
MARY ANN
You’re torturing yourself.
His phone is ringing.
CHARLIE
Just make sure everything doesn’t
go to hell here. I’m relying on
you, OK?
Fine.

MARY ANN
Thanks.

CHARLIE

62.
He kisses her on the head.
CHARLIE
Hold on, let me--

She flushes, rebuffed.
MARY ANN
I wish you’d accept
generosity better.

CHARLIE
(hesitates after this
remark and answers the
phone)
Hello?
Charlie pushes open the fire exit doors-INT. STAIRWELL. SAME
NORA
Is this Charlie Barber?
Yes.

CHARLIE
NORA
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw, I

Do you have an attorney yet?
No.

CHARLIE
NORA
OK, then it’s OK for me to talk to
you directly. OK?
OK.

CHARLIE
NORA
I’m calling because we haven’t
received a response to our filing.
The set designer, Agnes, opens the door to the stairwell
and holds up two photos of stools. Charlie points at one
of them. The designer nods.

63.
CHARLIE
Yeah, I’ve been rehearsing this
play and flying back and forth to
LA-NORA
You’re going to need to file your
response.
Now she holds up two images of phones. An old style one
from the 30’s and a rotary from the 70’s.

Nicole said there was no rush.
He points at the rotary.

She nods gratefully and hurries

NORA
It says that very clearly on
the document you were given.
Did you read it?

CHARLIE
But I thought that’s just what it
says...we weren’t going to even do
it with lawyers-Charlie absent-mindedly fiddles with the X-Acto knife on
his key chain, opening and closing it. Frank pokes his
head in.
FRANK
Charlie, I’m thinking I shouldn’t
tuck in the shirt?
CHARLIE
(holding up a finger to
say “hold on”)
Nicole said I could take my
time--

FRANK
--it keeps coming out during
the love scene--

NORA
And we’ve let you take your
time...
CHARLIE
What love scene?

FRANK
When I hug Beth.

CHARLIE
You don’t hug Beth.
FRANK
It’s something I’m trying.
NORA
If you don’t file your
response we’re going to file
a request for default
judgement against you.

You can’t just tuck it in
tighter or get Donna to

I also have a thing about tucking
in things-Charlie indicates for Frank to come forward.

Yes, sorry-Frank looks at his reflection in the glass of a fire

Um, OK, what do I do?

LONG DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RENTAL CAR AREA, LAX AIRPORT. DAY
A plane flies over palm trees and strip malls. We MOVE
down to find: Charlie, dressed in a black coat and black
jeans, wandering around aimlessly in a parking lot.
INT. RENTAL CAR. DAY
Charlie drives, fiddling with the air conditioning to no
apparent success. He looks uncomfortable and hot. The sun
suddenly blinds him through the windshield.
CHARLIE
(squinting)
Ugh, I can’t see..
(pause)
And I’m still driving.
EXT. SANDRA’S HOUSE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, LOS ANGELES, DAY
Henry comes running out. He wears shorts and high socks.
Charlie opens his arms but doesn’t get a hug as Henry is on
to other things.
HENRY
Me and Mommy are in the middle of
a Super Secret Treasure Hunt-CHARLIE
What are you wearing?
Nicole follows.

Her hair has been dyed blonde.

NICOLE
I thought the plane landed at ten.
It did.

CHARLIE
Sock pants!

HENRY

67.
CHARLIE
What are sock pants?
NICOLE
He doesn’t like the breeze on his
legs-CHARLIE
There are long pants--

NICOLE
He dressed himself.

CHARLIE
Can I talk to you-HENRY
Why don’t we ever do a
treasure hunt?

NICOLE
It’s almost noon.

CHARLIE
(aside to Henry)
We got to get going-HENRY
I’m not done searching for my
money!
CHARLIE
(to Nicole)
Can I talk to you for a
minute? Henry, can you wait
a minute--

HENRY
No talking alone.

CHARLIE
Just one bit of talking alone and
then I’ll be right there-He walks Nicole over away from the car and Henry.
CHARLIE
I got a call from your lawyer.
She said you’d take everything and
custody and everything if I didn’t
respond.
NICOLE
That’s how lawyers talk--

CHARLIE
Yeah, but she’s saying
things I don’t think you
mean--

NICOLE
It’s better if we just let the
lawyers do this--

CHARLIE
We said we’d figure this out
together.
Henry starts running back to the house.
CHARLIE
Henry, we need to get going-NICOLE
Have you gotten a lawyer
yet?

HENRY
I don’t want to go now.

CHARLIE
That’s what I’m here to do.
Charlie opens the car door.
CHARLIE
Come on, Henry, I’m in a rush-(to Nicole)
And I looked Nora up. She’s
fancy. We...you can’t afford her.
NICOLE
She said she’d make it work-CHARLIE
(shouting)
Henry!

HENRY
I have three more clues!

CHARLIE
(to Nicole)
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my
arrival?
NICOLE
You were late, we were killing
time.
HENRY
I’m going to be rich!
NICOLE
(aloud)
We can finish the treasure hunt
later. Go with Daddy now, it’ll
be FUN.
(loud whisper)
I’ll have a present for you when
you get back as a reward--

69.
CHARLIE
(glares at Nicole)
He’s not going to the dentist.
NICOLE
I’m trying to help--

HENRY
I’m staying here.

Henry grabs hold of his Mom.

OK--

NICOLE
(laughs)
Charlie gently takes Henry’s arm.
Come on-Henry yanks it back.
clutching his Mom.
Henry--

CHARLIE
Charlie pulls again on Henry who is

CHARLIE

NICOLE
You have a booster?

This tug of war feels ridiculous and Charlie lets go.
CHARLIE
I have a booster.
Nicole looks at the car-seat in the back of the car.
NICOLE
It’s not in.
CHARLIE
What’s not in?

NICOLE
The seat. It’s not
connected.

Charlie leans in. The car-seat isn’t connected to
anything. Charlie and Nicole, both crouched closely
together in the back seat, share a small laugh.
CHARLIE
I asked the rental company to
install it.
NICOLE
I think they can’t for liability
reasons-CHARLIE
Do you know how these things-

NICOLE
Let me do it--

70.
Henry itches his nose as he watches his parents struggle
with the booster seat.
NICOLE
No, you have to--

CHARLIE
There should be a clip
thing, a thing to clip on
to.

NICOLE
Here, you have dig--

Ow, fuck.

CHARLIE

HENRY
Why “fuck?”
You OK?

NICOLE
CHARLIE
Something’s sharp-Charlie gets out, he’s sweating and his hand is bleeding.
HENRY
Can’t I stay with Mom?
No-Why not?

CHARLIE
HENRY
CHARLIE
It’s my time with you. I
just flew three thousand
miles.

HENRY
I don’t want to--

CHARLIE
Henry, get in the fucking car!
Henry laughs uncomfortably and then reluctantly climbs in.
CHARLIE
(defeated)
I’m sorry, but Jesus, get in the
fucking car.
INT. RENTAL CAR. DAY
Charlie drives. He sucks on his hand which is bleeding
looks at all the billboards on the strip. Henry sits in
the back.
HENRY
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

CHARLIE
That’s two words.

What does Lego

HENRY
Just tell me.
CHARLIE
Don’t you want to learn it?
HENRY
No, it’s on the box anyway.

L.

CHARLIE

HENRY
Then what?
CHARLIE
E. You know, everyone at the
theater says Hi.
Hi.

HENRY
Then what?

CHARLIE
A “ggg” sound. Are you excited
for Halloween?
J?
G.

HENRY
CHARLIE
Then what?

HENRY

CHARLIE
An “O” sound.
O.

Yeah.

HENRY

CHARLIE
Are you excited for
Halloween?

HENRY

CHARLIE
I brought both our costumes.

HENRY
I’m going to go as a store-bought
ninja.
CHARLIE
But we agreed, I had Donna make
you a Frankenstein.
HENRY
I don’t want to be a Frankenstein
anymore.

72.
CHARLIE
Are you sure, maybe just look at
it? It’s awesome. We’ll be
Frankenstein and the Invisible
Man!
HENRY
Mom bought me a ninja costume
which is better because it costs
more.
CHARLIE
Technically, the
Frankenstein costs more when
you factor in Donna’s time
and the materials--

HENRY
The cousins are also going
to be ninjas.

CHARLIE
(frustrated)
But Henry, we went through all
this trouble-(catching himself)
OK, whatever you want...
EXT./INT. PARKING ENTRANCE
Charlie lowers the window and stretches his arm out to push
the button to get the ticket, but he’s not pulled in close
enough. He has to open the door, unbuckle himself, and
step out to push it.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY
A wide white space flanked by windows. Charlie, still
sucking on his hand, carries two travel bags and he and
Henry, having checked in, head toward the elevator bank.
CHARLIE
(in the middle of a
previous conversation)
...and so I’m not
comfortable leaving the bags
in a car where I’ve given
the key to someone I don’t
know--

HENRY
I’ve been here.

CHARLIE
It’s an office building so you’ve
been to places like this before.
INT. LAW OFFICE
Charlie approaches the receptionist.

73.
HENRY
I remember those fish.
CHARLIE
A lot of fish look the same.
The receptionist looks up.
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you-CHARLIE
I’m Charlie Barber, I have a
one thirty with Dan Cohen.

RECEPTIONIST
(to the kid)
Oh, hi. Where’s your little
man?

HENRY
I don’t have it this time.
my skeletons at my mom’s.

I keep

Charlie looks at Henry strangely and back at the
receptionist. She scrolls on her computer and frowns.
RECEPTIONIST
OK... Oh, OK... I’m sorry, we
tried to reach you, Mr. Cohen
wanted me to apologize. He can’t
see you because apparently your
wife already met with him on the
7th of August about
representation...
CHARLIE
But she hired somebody else, uh,
Nora...
RECEPTIONIST
Fanshaw? But unfortunately
because she consulted with Mr.
Cohen already, he’s legally barred
from representing you.
Oh...

CHARLIE
Really?

RECEPTIONIST
(to Henry)
Should we feed the fish?

She rises and leads Henry over to the tank.
RECEPTIONIST
It happens all the time. If you
have a ticket I can validate your
parking.

74.
Charlie searches for his ticket. He gets blood from his
hand on the loose bills and receipts in his pocket.
RECEPTIONIST
It’s common that people meet with
as many lawyers as possible so
that their spouse has limited
options.
CHARLIE
I don’t think she would have done
it deliberately.
RECEPTIONIST
You’d be surprised.
CHARLIE
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?
HENRY
Not so many. Like eleven.
EXT. MINI-MALL/FAST FOOD RESTAURANT
In harsh sunlight, Charlie heads for his parked car, on the
phone, pulling a rolling bag and hauling a duffel. Henry
trails behind him, carrying Charlie’s lap-top bag and
eating a hamburger over a paper bag.
HENRY
I don’t think anyone would have
stealed the bags, Daddy.
CHARLIE
(into the phone)
I need somebody TODAY. If I don’t
respond by tomorrow, she said I
could lose custody? I didn’t know
who else to call... There’s got
to be someone she didn’t meet.
VOICE
(loud whisper)
She’d kill me if she knew we were
talking.
I know.

CHARLIE
I really appreciate

VOICE
It’s high alert over here.

75.
INT. SANDRA’S HOUSE, BATHROOM, LOS ANGELES. INTERCUT
Sandra, her head in a scarf, and tinted blue glasses on,
runs the shower to drown out her conversation and talks in
a whisper. She flips through an old address book.
SANDRA
OK, I have a name for you. Bert
Spitz. He was the entertainment
lawyer at Roberto’s agency, and
for years, he negotiated all of
Robbie’s Dynasty and Falcon Crest
deals. He kind of got pushed into
retirement a few years ago and he
went into family law.
HENRY
(reading a billboard)
“They’re out for bl-ode.”
CHARLIE
It’s a double “O”.
sound is that?

What

Blo-oode?

HENRY

CHARLIE
Blood. You’re getting good at
reading.
HENRY
“They’re out for blood.”
Charlie and Henry approach the car in the parking lot.
SANDRA
I called him and he can see you
today at 4.
Great!

CHARLIE
SANDRA
And he should be more affordable.
Charlie opens the back door and indicates for Henry to go
in. Henry drops his burger on the pavement.
Oh, shit.

HENRY
CHARLIE
Thank you G-ma. Thank you.

Dad!

HENRY

Sandra now lies on the tile floor looking under the
bathroom door to see if someone is listening.

76.
SANDRA
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.
Got it!
Mom?!

CHARLIE
I love you.

NICOLE (O.S.)

SANDRA
I have to go--

Sandra hangs up.
HENRY
I need a new burger.
Why?

CHARLIE
HENRY
Because you made us carry your
bags into the restaurant, I
dropped it.
Charlie picks up the burger and wipes it off.
CHARLIE
(handing it back)
It’s fine, get in the car.
HENRY
Why did you take me today if you
couldn’t hang out with me?
CHARLIE
Because I’ve been away and want to
see you.
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. DAY
A cramped parking lot in the back of an old run-down
building on Hollywood Boulevard. Charlie helps Henry out
of the back seat.
BERT (V.O.)
Getting a divorce with a kid can
be one of the hardest things
you’ll ever do. It’s like a death
without a body.

77.
INT. BERT SPITZ’S LAW OFFICE. DAY
A man, late 60’s, in slacks and a tweed jacket, takes a
pill from a container and swallows it with a glass of
water. This is Bert Spitz. A grizzled cat wheezes in a
corner on a stained pillow.
BERT
I know, personally I’ve been there
four different times.
CHARLIE
You’ve been divorced four times?
BERT
I’ve been married four times.
Three divorces. This last one
will stick God willing.
Charlie nods as Bert sits across from him.
BERT
That’s why I graduated into family
law. To help people survive this
painful time.
(leans forward)
Here’s how I see it: If we get
bogged down in who did this and
that and “I don’t want to pay the
two dollars” it’ll just cost you
more money and time and emotional
stress, and you’ll probably end up
with the same result anyway.
CHARLIE
Right. I mean, I agree with
that philosophy. She does
too, I’m sure.

BERT
And I always go with the
truth wherever that takes
us. Most people in this
business make up the truth
to get to where they need to
go.

BERT
You’re just transactions to them.
I like to think of you as people.
Oh.

OK.

CHARLIE
Good.

BERT
And not just you, her too.

78.

Yes.

CHARLIE

BERT
It can be an ugly process.
But I believe it also
doesn’t have to be terrible.

CHARLIE
I’m glad to hear you say that.
Um, I’d love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.
BERT
Of course you do. I charge 450 an
hour and I’ll need a ten thousand
dollar retainer to start.
CHARLIE
Maybe this is a stupid question,
but is there any way to do this on
a budget?
BERT
This is the budget version.
CHARLIE
(swallows)
I’ll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer...
BERT
And keep in mind, you’ll have to
pay for her lawyer.
CHARLIE
Oh... I didn’t...

What?

BERT
Or at least part of her. It
doesn’t make sense, does it? The
reason you’re doing this is
because you love your kid and in
doing so you’re draining money
from your kid’s education.
CHARLIE
It seems ridiculous.
BERT
Oh, it is.
Bert shuffles through the papers in front of him.

79.
BERT
We’ll have to respond right away.
(re: the papers)
Your son is in school out here?
CHARLIE
Temporarily. We agreed. Her
pilot went to series and I wanted
to accommodate her as she’s often
felt we do things on my terms.
BERT
Be a better husband in divorce.
CHARLIE
I guess something like that.
we live in New York.

But

BERT
(putting on his glasses)
With your kid in school here, the
court may see it otherwise.
CHARLIE
(alarmed)
Will we go to court?
BERT
No no no, we don’t want to go to
court, the California courts are a
disaster -- it’s just how we have
to think about it.
(looks back at the
papers)
I’m not sure these are my glasses.
(removes them, stands)
Where are you living when you’re
out here?
CHARLIE
I’m in a hotel right now-To who?

BERT
Hotel doesn’t look good.

CHARLIE
BERT
The court.
CHARLIE
You just said we weren’t going to
go to court.

80.
BERT
Of course, of course. We prepare
to go to court hoping that we
don’t go to court.
OK.

CHARLIE
BERT
You should get a place in LA. And
get a place NEAR her. That will
look better for custody reasons.
CHARLIE
She’s in West Hollywood. That’ll
be expensive. I guess I could
rent our New York apartment.
BERT
Don’t rent it, you need to
continue to prove New York
residence-CHARLIE
(not sure what he’s
going to do)
OK.

BERT
And of course getting a
place in LA, doesn’t make it
look like you all live in
New York, does it?

CHARLIE
So...
(hesitates)
What do I do?
BERT
I recommend you try to spend as
much time with your child as
possible. Many people fight to
get the time and then they don’t
even use it. They just want to
win.
Bert leaves his office and disappears down a hallway.
Charlie follows.
CHARLIE
This shouldn’t be that
complicated, right? I mean, we’re
a New York family. I think it’s
all pretty straight-forward.
Right?

81.
Charlie finds Bert in a kitchen area. The old cat
following them. Bert opens an old fridge and takes out
some of kind of meat and rice in a tupperware container.
BERT
I hope so, yes. I see no reason-you both love your son, you
respect each other--why this
shouldn’t be relatively pain-free?
CHARLIE
(pleased)
Right.
Bert gathers plastic silverware from a drawer and heads
through another doorway into an outer office/waiting area.
Charlie hesitates and follows.
Henry looks at a magazine on the floor with Bert’s
associate, Nell, 30’s.
BERT
(handing Nell his
glasses)
I think you have my glasses-She takes off hers and they swap.

She nods.

NELL
That makes sense.
CHARLIE
(to Henry)
What have you been doing?
NELL
We were talking about money.

HENRY
And I was reading this
magazine.

CHARLIE
(looking)
You were reading California
Lawyer?
Uh uh.

HENRY
CHARLIE
OK, I’m almost done.
Henry pets the old cat.

82.
BERT
I wouldn’t expect too much from
that cat.
Charlie follows Bert back to the kitchen.
BERT
I want you to know that eventually
this will all be over and whatever
we win or lose, it’ll be the two
of you having to figure this out
together.
CHARLIE
(moved)
Thank you. You’re the first
person in this process who has
spoken to me like a human.
Bert, tears in his eyes, hugs Charlie.
BERT
You remind me of myself, on my
second marriage.
Mommy!

HENRY (V.O.)
INT. SANDRA’S HOUSE, LOS ANGELES
Henry runs in and hugs Nicole. Charlie stands in the
doorway, he holds the Frankenstein Halloween costume. The
place is decorated warmly for the holiday and deliciouslooking food is being prepared by a house-keeper.
NICOLE
Did you have fun with Daddy?
HENRY
We drove around to offices.
NICOLE
Do you want to try on your ninja
costume? It’s on your bed!
Yeah!

HENRY
Henry runs upstairs.
CHARLIE
You know I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing with
the plugs and --

83.
NICOLE
The cousins are ninjas so he
wanted to do that too.

CHARLIE
But he and I had decided
together--

NICOLE
I can’t make him be Frankenstein.
CHARLIE
I’m not asking you to. But maybe
you could help me out a little.
I’ll leave the Frankenstein here
and maybe you can nudge him in
that direction-I’ll try.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
What’s the...did you dye your hair
again? Is that for your show?
NICOLE
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.
CHARLIE
I know, but I didn’t say anything
then.
NICOLE
You don’t like it?

CHARLIE
No, I guess...it’s fine.
it shorter? I prefer it
long, but...

Is

NICOLE
(laughs bitterly)
I’m sorry, it’s just -- absurd.
CHARLIE
Is everything OK?
Yeah, why?

NICOLE

CHARLIE
You seem...I don’t know like
something is--

NICOLE
Everything’s fine.
OK.

CHARLIE
Charlie peers over her shoulder again at the warm living
room. Nicole stands as a sort of barrier.

84.
CHARLIE
OK, I’m going to check in at the
hotel, but should be able to get
to you guys by five, five thirty.
We’ll go trick or treating from
there-NICOLE
Um, we’re going to go to Cassie’s
in Pasadena.
CHARLIE
Cassie lives in Pasadena
now?

NICOLE
And trick-or-treating with
the cousins.

NICOLE
Yeah, she and Sam moved a couple
of months ago.
CHARLIE
OK. I don’t really know Pasadena.
I’ll figure it out. What’s the
address? I’ll text Sam.
NICOLE
And because my mom is
looking forward to this and
Cassie and Sam are-Are mad--

CHARLIE
Wait until you see MY
costume.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
Mad at who?
You.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
Cassie and Sam?

NICOLE
You can understand that.

NICOLE
--so I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens-CHARLIE
But if you’re OK with it, then
shouldn’t they be OK with it-NICOLE
Let’s just do it this way
this time. OK?

CHARLIE
Do you not want me there?

85.
NICOLE
(hesitates)
No, I’m fine with it.
OK.

CHARLIE

NICOLE
It’ll be nice for him, he’ll
get two Halloweens.

CHARLIE
What am I going to do with him for
second Halloween? Walk around
Sunset Boulevard?
NICOLE
Maybe the hotel has something?
you can drive to another
neighborhood?

Or

INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
Charlie, wrapped in gauze, in a brown suit sleeps slumped
over on the couch. The TV is on. The hat in his lap. A
beer and a crinkled candy wrapper from the mini-bar on the
coffee table.
The doorbell rings.

He startles awake.

He puts on the hat, checks himself in the mirror,
straightens his goggles and gauze and opens the door.
Nicole is dressed in a peach suit and her hair in a sort of
pompadour a la David Bowie. Henry dawdles behind her, in
the hallway. His ninja mask is askew and his costume
hanging partly off. Charlie, ignoring Nicole, greets
Henry.
CHARLIE
(muffled by the gauze)
OK! Ready for Halloween!
NICOLE
(re: Charlie’s costume)
Wow. Elaborate.
Charlie adjusts his goggles.
NICOLE
(to Henry)
Sweetheart, don’t forget your
jacket. It’s getting colder.
Henry passes by both of them and into the room. Charlie
parts the gauze over his mouth so he can talk easier.

86.
CHARLIE
(calls to Henry)
You ready to go back out?
NICOLE
He has to pee.
HENRY
No, I don’t.
NICOLE
(to Charlie)
He does.
She hands Charlie Henry’s backpack.
NICOLE
Some of his men and Bear Bear are
in there-- You can keep this Bear
Bear because I got another one-CHARLIE
Does he know that there are two
Bear Bears?
NICOLE
Yes, it was his idea--

HENRY (O.S.)
I have LA Bear Bear and New
York Bear Bear--

Charlie regards Nicole.
CHARLIE
Station to Station?
NICOLE
Let’s Dance.
(waving)
OK, bye Henry. Have a great
Halloween with Daddy.
(to Charlie)
Have fun.
Charlie nods coldly and closes the door.
HENRY
(re: the hotel room)
This is a nice house.
Henry turns his plastic jack o’ lantern over and dumps all
his candy on the floor. He lies down and starts sorting
it.

87.
CHARLIE
(forcing enthusiasm)
Go pee and then we’re going back
out!
HENRY
I’m too tired!
CHARLIE
GO pee and then we’re going to go
drive to Halloween!
INT. CHARLIE’S RENTAL CAR
Charlie, wiping moisture off the windshield, cranes his
neck, trying to see out the glass.
CHARLIE
This block looks promising--

HENRY
I wish Halloween was over.

CHARLIE
Well, it isn’t.
(looking for parking)
If we were in New York we could be
walking.
HENRY
But I like that we’re sitting
right now. I like to sit.
CHARLIE
That’s true, Los Angeles does have
sitting going for it.
HENRY
I think that’s why I like Los
Angeles better.
CHARLIE
Because you get to sit?

HENRY
And because I like my
friends here better.

CHARLIE
That’s not true. What about
Horatio and Poppy and-HENRY
Horatio doesn’t like me anymore
and I don’t like Poppy. Here I
have Axel. Axel is hilarious.
And my family is here. Besides
you.

Trick or treat.
The seventeen year old clerk looks around and hands them
some junk.
INT. CHARLIE’S RENTAL CAR
Charlie drives.

Henry is falling asleep in the backseat.

INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
They both exhaustedly enter. Henry turns his plastic jack
o’ lantern over and a couple of things trickle out.
Something lands with a thud. Charlie picks it up.
CHARLIE
Who gave you a lighter?
HENRY
(holding his fly)
I have to pee.
Henry goes into the bathroom to pee.

Charlie gets a beer.

CHARLIE
I’m going to have to go back to
New York on Monday.

89.
Henry comes back out.
CHARLIE
Did you flush?
Henry goes back in and does.

Comes back out.

CHARLIE
Wash your hands.
Henry returns to the bathroom.
and then he reappears.

Charlie hears the water run

CHARLIE
Did you hear me? I have to go
back to New York.
Henry gathers some of his toys.
HENRY
(playing with his men)
Aaah, watch out... BSSSHH! “I’m
falling.” “I’ll catch you.”
BOOOM. “You didn’t catch me.”
OK?

CHARLIE
HENRY
Why aren’t you here more?
CHARLIE
I have to work. You know my play
is opening on Broadway.
HENRY
Is it because you don’t want to be
near mom?
CHARLIE
No-- You know, like we’ve talked
about, we’ve decided not to be
together no matter where we are.
But we both want to be with you.
HENRY
But you’re not near me if you’re
in New York.
CHARLIE
(clarifying)
Well, we all still live in New
York.

90.

Yeah.

HENRY
But I go to school here.

CHARLIE
Just for right now. Like that
time we were in Copenhagen for my
play. Remember all those kids in
buckets?
HENRY
I like my school here and Mom says
we can stay here if we want.
Charlie freezes.
CHARLIE
What do you mean...She said that?
Yeah.

HENRY
CUT TO: Henry is asleep in the king size bed in Charlie’s
room with his bear as a pillow. Charlie turns out the
light and adjusts the covers. He watches Henry for a beat
and kisses him on the cheek.
Hello?

NICOLE (V.O.)
EXT. HOTEL BALCONY. NIGHT
Charlie steps out onto the small concrete balcony attached
to his room. He’s on the phone.
CHARLIE
Are you moving out here?
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HALLOWEEN PARTY. INTERCUT
We see now: Nicole stands out by a pool on the phone.
She’s still dressed as David Bowie. Agents, the ex-husband
and wife producers from her show, actors, all in costume,
mingle inside and out.
NICOLE
(pause)
Did you find a lawyer?
CHARLIE
Yes. Henry says you’re moving
here???
NICOLE
Have your lawyer call Nora.

91.
Charlie clicks his portable X-Acto knife in and out.
CHARLIE
I want to talk about it as us.
NICOLE
Who the fuck is “us?”
CHARLIE
Let’s just get in a room, YOU and
ME, that’s what we always said
we’d do.
NICOLE
My lawyers wouldn’t let me
sign anything.

CHARLIE
It’s not up to them. It’s
up to us. It’s OUR divorce.

NICOLE
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.
CHARLIE
(frustrated and growing
angry)
What am I walking into?
NICOLE
What are you walking into?!
CHARLIE
Yes! What the fuck is going on?
NICOLE
I read your fucking emails,
CHARLIE. I read them all.
When?

CHARLIE
NICOLE
You are a FUCKING LIAR. You
fucked Mary Ann.

NICOLE
I don’t know. Recently!
... Shit.

CHARLIE

CHARLIE
(weakly)
It was after I was sleeping on the
couch.
Some guests glance over at Nicole who is now shouting.

92.
NICOLE
And all this bullshit about
working on us or whatever, you
know what-- I HAVE been working,
I’ve BEEN DOING THE WORK. ALONE.
CHARLIE
How did you read my emails?
NICOLE
I HACKED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT
YOU DUMB FUCK.

CHARLIE
I think that’s illegal.

NICOLE
About a week ago. So don’t
give me this shit about
being surprised about LA.
Surprise! I have opinions.
Surprise! I want things that
aren’t what you want because
SURPRISE YOU WERE FUCKING
ANOTHER LADY.

CHARLIE
How do you even know how to
do something like that?

CHARLIE
I think you’re conflating two
different things. Mary Ann has
nothing to do with LA.
NICOLE
I’m conflating, motherfucker.
Watch me conflate!
She hangs up and visibly stamps her foot.
PABLO (O.S.)
Did you just stamp your foot?
NICOLE
I don’t think I’ve ever done that
before. I’m sorry I’m just so
ANGRY.
She’s handed a drink by Pablo, the tatted grip from her
show. He wears a tight black T-shirt with a ratty flannel
thrown over it and black jeans.

You look like you needed one.
I do.

Thanks.

You know the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right
now.
NICOLE
(distracted)
That’s exciting, I guess.
PABLO
What are you so angry about?
NICOLE
Ugh, my fucking ex-husband. I
spend so much time feeling guilty,
but he’s so self-absorbed it’s
pointless. It’s a game I’m
playing with myself.

Oh, hey, Pablo. We met at

NICOLE
I want you to finger me.

NICOLE
Just finger me.
OK.

That’s all we’re going to do, OK?
Just fingering. I’m changing my

NORA (V.O.)
Nicole and Charlie’s son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles and
currently attends Laurel
Elementary in Laurel Canyon-INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CENTURY CITY, LA. DAY
CLOSE on Nicole.
NORA (O.S.)
--and Nicole works in Hollywood on
her show while also maintaining a
full schedule as a mother with
classes of swim, art, gym and
music as well as play groups.
And then CUT TO Charlie, in a dark wool suit, who sweats.
NORA (O.S.)
Nicole is Henry's primary
custodial parent and to the extent
that Charlie would like to
exercise his custodial time, he
should be making efforts to visit
Henry here in California.
And now INTERCUT between their two faces as if they’re
having a conversation, though neither of them opens their
mouth. They both listen to their representatives,
sometimes with emotion, other times anger, disbelief, and
self-consciousness. They occasionally look at their hands
or jot down a note.
BERT (O.S.)
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the
fact that they lived in New York
for ten years-NORA (O.S.)
My client worked in New York, for
several years--that’s true. But
Nicole was born and bred right
here in LA. She and Charlie would
come here most holidays and
summers to spend time with her
family who all live here. She and
Charlie were married here, would
you like to see the photos?
We CUT WIDE.
The room has big windows with views of other surrounding
glass offices.

95.
Nicole sits next to Nora who looks amazing in an expensive,
fitted power suit and heels. Behind them sits, Amir,
Nora’s associate.
BERT
I don’t need to see the photos-Although I’m sure they both look
beautiful-Bert grins at Charlie who seems to be sweating through his
wool blazer. They sit across the wide table. Bert’s
associate Nell behind them in a chair by the window.
BERT
It’s my client’s expectation that
after this TV show is completed,
the parties will move back to New
York where they currently keep an
apartment-NORA
And it’s my understanding that
Charlie PROMISED Nicole that they
would spend more time in LA during
the marriage but because of
Charlie’s insistence that his work
keep them in New York, Nicole
ended up staying much longer than
she ever anticipated. In fact, a
few years ago, Charlie was offered
a residency at the Geffen
Playhouse that would have taken
his work and family to LA for a
year and he turned it down knowing
full well that this was Nicole’s
desire.
BERT
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.
NORA
Was this the same consistency he
wanted to maintain when they went
to Copenhagen for six months so he
could direct a play?
An assistant has her head in the door trying to get Amir’s
attention.

96.
NORA
So, while I understand that
CHARLIE lives in New York and when
it’s convenient for his work
schedule, flies out here to see
his son-BERT
He flies out here every
chance he gets at great
expense--

NORA
(looking at Charlie)
I don’t see any reason you
can’t be out here full-time.

Amir acknowledges the anxious assistant and interrupts.
AMIR
Oh... Sorry. Do we want to
contemplate lunch--I’ll order now
so it’ll come when we’re all
hungry?
Good idea.

BERT
BERT
I love Manny’s.

AMIR
Everyone good with Manny’s?
NORA
(to Charlie)
Have you had Manny’s?

Charlie is taken aback, unsure how to process this
question. He shakes his head.
NORA
You’ll love it, just really yummy
salads and sandwiches.
CHARLIE
(nods)
Great.
Amir passes out menus. Orders are made, Bert specifying no
butter or cream. It gets to Charlie, he’s unsure.
CHARLIE
(re: the menu)
Hmm, I don’t know--

Sorry...

NICOLE
(reflexively)
Charlie will have the greek salad.
OK.

CHARLIE

NICOLE
But with olive oil and lemon
instead of the greek
dressing, and I’ll get the
Chinese chicken salad.

97.
Charlie nods, satisfied. Amir writes down the orders and
hands them to an associate who exits. Nora gets up to pour
herself and Nicole more coffee.
NORA
Congratulations, Charlie, on your
grant, Nicole told me.
CHARLIE
(can’t help but smile)
Thank you.

BERT
He’s a genius.

He tussles Charlie’s hair. Everyone laughs awkwardly.
Charlie blushes. Nicole smiles sweetly, sensing his
discomfort. Nora raises a mug, offering Charlie.
CHARLIE
Oh, thanks.
NORA
I told Nicole, I LOVED your play.
You are one smart cookie. I’d
love to get inside your brain!
Thanks.

CHARLIE
NORA
There was that one moment when you
smell the toast.
(to Amir)
Smell! It was literally my
favorite thing I saw that year.
Truly genius.
BERT
(to Charlie)
I was sorry to hear it closed on
Broadway.
CHARLIE
(to himself)
They couldn’t smell the toast.
Charlie looks at Bert, like why bring that up?
BERT
It’s very competitive, I imagine.
Charlie nods.

Nora places the coffee in front of Charlie.

Thanks.

CHARLIE

98.
NORA
(launching back in)
Now, whenever Charlie is in LA,
Nicole, of course, agrees that it
will best for Henry to see each
parent equally-(to Charlie)
It’s nice out here, Charlie. You
should give it a chance.
AMIR
Yeah, and the space -- you can’t
beat it.
BERT
I love it too, but all of our
personal feelings about the two
cities aside, we don’t share your
assertion that the couple is an LA
based family. It was very clearly
their deal that they would go back
to New York after Nicole finished
her show.
NORA
I’m not aware of any deal.
CHARLIE
(can’t help himself)
I didn’t get it in writing.
NORA
Charlie, is this like the deal you
made that you and Nicole would
spend more time in LA during the
marriage?
CHARLIE
(flustered)
We didn’t have a deal. It was
something we discussed...but...
NORA
So, it’s a deal when it’s
something you want, but it’s a
discussion when Nicole wants it?
Silence.
BERT
Sidebar!

Charlie’s arm)
(MORE)

99.
BERT (CONT'D)
Nora, is there a spare office,
where Charlie and I could sidebar?
INT. SMALLER CONFERENCE ROOM
A small, windowless, bare impersonal room with a table, a
phone, some left-out coffee cups and a plate with crumbs.
BERT
(a bit overwhelmed)
Nora’s a very good lawyer.
Uh huh.

CHARLIE

Yeah.

BERT
(impressed)
Tough, right?
CHARLIE

BERT
And you’re in a bind because
you’ve shown that you’re willing
to fly out here and rent an
apartment to see your son-CHARLIE
You told me to do that!
I know that.

BERT

CHARLIE
And I’m doing that because I
want to see my kid. Not to
set a precedent.

BERT
Yes, but unfortunately you are
setting a precedent. And a judge
may look at it that way.
CHARLIE
What’s the alternative? I stay in
New York and never come out here?
BERT
No, because then it will look to
the court like you don’t care
about seeing your son.
CHARLIE
Court or no court, stop saying
court and then never court!
BERT
Well, the way this is going, we
might have to go to court.

100.
CHARLIE
Are you aware how maddening you
sound?
BERT
I am. And I know it seems unfair.
But imagine if you were a poor
mother abandoned by her husband
who refuses to pay anything.
That’s what the system is trying
to protect people from.
Charlie nods.
BERT
Listen, if I were representing you-CHARLIE
You are representing me.
BERT
Right, no, of course. I don’t see
a judge moving this child from LA-I think we try to settle today-CHARLIE
Settle meaning... what?
BERT
She gets LA, but-CHARLIE
(upset)
No, Bert... just NO.
have to win this?

I mean, we

BERT
Remember, the win is what’s best
for Henry. And if you guys go to
court, he’ll get pulled into it.
CHARLIE
If he stays out here and I stay in
New York, that’s just, then I
won’t, I’ll never get to really be
his parent again.
BERT
It’ll be different.
CHARLIE
It won’t exist!

101.
BERT
Maybe you move here. You heard
what Amir said about the space.
CHARLIE
Fuck the space, Bert.
SPACE.

FUCK THE

BERT
I’ll do whatever you want me to
do, but this is my advice. I’ve
seen these things go on and on and
the burden of these battles is
immeasurable. I had a client get
colon cancer and die before he and
his wife came to agreement.
CHARLIE
What about filing in New York?
BERT
It’s too late and even if you did,
I don’t think it would matter.
They’re being reasonable
financially. You’re lucky they’re
not asking for half of your grant
money-CHARLIE
She wouldn’t do that. She knows,
I put all that money back in my
theater.
BERT
If this continues, she might.
CHARLIE
The actors and crew all rely on
that money, they have families and- A court would never agree with
this, right?
BERT
Whether they do or not, it’ll cost
you half your grant money anyway
to go to court and prove it.
Charlie deflates.
CHARLIE
I feel like a criminal.
BERT
But you didn’t commit any crime.

102.
CHARLIE
It doesn’t feel that way.
BERT
If we give on LA right now and try
to make the best deal possible, I
think we can get her to give on
some other fronts.
CHARLIE
There are no other fronts. This
is the thing.
(suddenly emotional)
He needs to know that I fought for
him.
He’ll know.

BERT

CHARLIE
(dismayed)
I should never have let her
come out here with Henry.

BERT
If it wasn’t LA and New York it
would be something else. You’d be
fighting over a house or school
district or... It’s like the joke
about the woman at the hairdresser
who’s going to Rome-I don’t--

CHARLIE

BERT
A woman is at her
hairdresser’s and she says,
“Oh, I’m going to Rome on
holiday” and the hairdresser
says--

Charlie stares at the clock on the wall.
BERT
“What airline are you taking?”
And she says, “Al Italia.” And he
says, “Oh that’s the worst airline
I’ve--”
He continues the joke as Charlie observes the second hand
moving around the circle. Finally:
CHARLIE
I’m sorry, Bert, but am I paying
for this joke?
Bert hesitates.

103.
BERT
No matter what happens here, it’s
temporary. He’s growing up, he’s
going to have opinions on the
subject. Time is on your side,
Charlie. Maybe he’ll do college
on the East Coast.
CUT TO: Henry’s face. He’s talking animatedly about how
much money he has in his piggybank.
HENRY
I have my quarters and dimes at
Daddy’s, but I’m keeping my
dollars and my one twenty with
you, OK?
Charlie watches him.
INT. CHARLIE’S RENTAL APARTMENT. EVENING
Nicole’s face is on the computer screen in front of Henry.
He’s doing Face Time with her.
The place is small and mostly bare with furniture that came
with it.
CLOSE: A bill from Bert’s firm for 25 thousand dollars.
Charlie sits at a table with a stack of bills, legal
letters, and a checkbook open. He hesitates.
NICOLE (O.S.)
Goddamn it.
HENRY
What’s goddamn it?
NICOLE
Did you lose power where you are?
HENRY
Dad, did we lose power?!

No.

CHARLIE

NICOLE
It’s back on now. There are
rolling blackouts in the hills but
now the gate won’t close.
HENRY
Her gate won’t close!

EXT. NICOLE’S NEW HOUSE, ECHO PARK. NIGHT
Nicole stands outside in the dark. The gate is wide open.
Charlie appears from the shadows holding Henry’s hand.
Henry runs and hugs his mom.

I tried everything.
HENRY

NICOLE

Henry runs inside.

They remain outside.

She nods and hands him to Charlie.
CUT TO: Charlie and a tired Henry pull on the gate. Nicole
helps, dragging from the other side. It starts to close.
They yank it shut, closing her in and them out. We CUT
QUICKLY between them both just as it closes. We stay with
her.
Fade to Black.
The sound of a couple loudly arguing in Spanish.

106.
INT. LOS ANGELES COURTHOUSE, HALLWAY. MORNING
A man and woman are shouting at each other. The lawyers
trying to separate them. Various benches are filled with
the other divorcing couples, men and women sitting apart
from one another with their individual representatives.
In their midst, Nora and Nicole sit on a bench in the wide,
dingy hallway. Amir sorts through documents nearby.
NORA
I think we’re mostly finished.
Bert and I hammered out ninetypercent of the details, there’s a
couple minor things hanging that
should be easy and then the judge
will make your divorce official.
NICOLE
OK, good-NORA
I hear the tracking for your show
is off the chain-NICOLE
Oh, I don’t even know what that
means, but good I guess-NORA
I made sure the date of separation
came AFTER the pilot pick-up to
protect that money-(suddenly)
Fuck me.
What?

NICOLE
She follows Nora’s gaze to Jay Marotta who marches down the
hallway, conferring with Charlie.
JAY MAROTTA
It’s not television. It’s not a
wise judge played by a great
character actor. These are just
people open to manipulation like
anyone else. You think it’s
justice, but it’s not.
NICOLE
Who is that?

107.
NORA
Charlie shouldn’t have done this.
NICOLE
What do you mean?

Where’s Bert?

NORA
It means everything we’ve agreed
upon is now off the table.
Jay and Charlie take a bench a ways away.
some other lawyers.

Jay says Hi to

NICOLE
But, we’ve got LA, right-NORA
Not with Jay Marotta representing
him. This is a street fight now.
And I’m going to have to ask for
things we wouldn’t normally ask
for. We’ll need as much leverage
as possible to negotiate with.
Nora rises with a pinched smile-NORA
This system rewards bad behavior.
--and greets Jay.
Nicole looks over at Charlie who doesn’t meet her eye.
INT. COURT ROOM. DAY
The low hum of a copier machine and periodic mouse-clicks
from a computer.
JAY MAROTTA
A little history.
Jay speaks in front of the judge who clearly has a bad
cold. Charlie sits at the end of the table with Ted, the
associate. Nicole is at the corresponding end of an
adjacent table next to Nora and Amir.
JAY MAROTTA
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a
risk when he first hires Nicole as
an actress in his play in New York
City.
(MORE)

108.
JAY MAROTTA (CONT'D)
He’s a well regarded, up and
coming director of the avant garde
and she’s known as the girl in
that college sex movie who takes
her top off.
NORA
My client will not be slutshamed for an artistic
choice.

JAY MAROTTA
Ten years on and many
prestigious theater roles
later, she’s become an
actress of great
credibility. And because of
this credibility, she’s
offered a lead roll on a
major television show. This
new opportunity in her life
is thanks to Charlie. Your
honor, I don’t see why we
should be paying any support
money at this point. In
fact, Charlie should be
entitled to half of her TV
salary, present and future
earnings on the show.

Nora takes a moment.
NORA
Charlie has just received
the enormous sum of six
hundred and fifty thousand
dollars in the form of a
MacArthur grant for the
theater work he has
conducted during the
marriage.

JAY MAROTTA
Of which he gets in 125
thousand installments over
five years, money that is
used to employ actors and
crew members and to pay back
debts he’s accumulated with
his theater company that
stars his wife.

NORA
By Jay’s same logic, this is work
that Nicole contributed to in
numerous ways. Not only did she
give up a lucrative and successful
career in movies to perform in his
little theater, she also supplied
Charlie with a loan early on to
help out.
JAY
Which he paid back--

NORA
She lent her name to the
marquee and was the
principle reason people came
to the theater.

109.
JAY
That may have been true ten
years ago--

NORA
She, in turn, helped
establish Charlie’s
reputation.

Charlie looks over at Nicole.

She looks down.

NORA
Over the next ten years she was
subsequently offered parts in
movies, TV shows, most of which
she turned down at Charlie’s
bequest to be a mother and to act
in his plays. Now, while we’re
willing to be flexible on support
we contend that half of Charlie’s
grant money should be split
between the parties.
Charlie looks at Jay.
JAY MAROTTA
I don’t see how you can claim that
she gets half a grant dedicated to
his genius.
NORA
He became a genius during the
course of the marriage.
JAY MAROTTA
Oh, come on, Nora.

NORA
Charlie, himself, upon
hearing he received the
prize, told Nicole it
belonged to her too.

JAY MAROTTA
That’s something people say when
they win awards.
NORA
No, he was implying what was true:
his genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.
Charlie and Nicole both stare at the floor.

110.
JAY MAROTTA
Nora, I like how you refer to
Charlie’s theater as a ramshackled
downtown dump when you’re arguing
custody, but when you want more
money, Charlie’s a big rich genius
Broadway director. You can’t have
it both ways.
NORA
Why not? And whether you think
it’s fair or not, Jay, the first
monetary installment from the
MacArthur grant was then put in a
joint marital account and thus
became community property so this
and any further installments
should be split between the
parties.
Jay whispers to Charlie.
JAY MAROTTA
Fuck. You shouldn’t have put that
money in the joint account.
CHARLIE
There’s not going to be anything
left anyway, I’m using it all to
divorce her...
Jay turns back to Nora.
JAY MAROTTA
Nora, I have to say your account
of this marriage takes place in an
alternate reality. By suddenly
MOVING to LA, and insisting on an
LA residence, Nicole is
withholding Henry, alienating him
from his father. This has turned
Charlie’s world upside down. It
amounts to an ambush.
NORA
Withholding, Jay? Really?
Alienating. Those are fighting
words and it is simply false and
does nothing to further our
settlement. Your recap of this
situation is outrageous.
(MORE)

111.
NORA (CONT'D)
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,
it does bear mentioning in the
accurate recap of this situation
that Charlie had had extramarital
affairs-CHARLIE
AN extramarital affair.
Nora turns and stares at Charlie.
NORA
Do you really want me to go there?
JAY MAROTTA
Let’s go there. Nicole has
admitted to HACKING Charlie’s
computer and reading his emails.
Nora turns to Nicole who shrugs.

Jay stands.

JAY MAROTTA
Which if proven is a felony. And
Nora, I don’t think you’ll be happy
if I start to ask Nicole about her
alcohol consumption in the evenings-What?

NICOLE
JAY MAROTTA
She confided in Charlie one night
recently, having just carried
Henry to bed, that she was having
trouble standing while walking
down the staircase. From what I
understand this was not an
isolated event. You let me know,
Nora, otherwise we’ll go there as
needed.
Jay sits back down.

Nicole stares at Charlie who looks

NORA
Charlie, can I ask you: How can
you expect to have more time with
Henry when you don’t exercise the
time you have AND exercise it
responsibly.

112.
NORA (CONT'D)
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,
after failing to text, call or
communicate in any way, shape or
form, Charlie finally arrived two
hours late to pick up Henry at
Nicole’s mother’s house. At that
point the car seat which he
assured Nicole had been
professionally installed was
clearly not even belted in, just
sitting on the back seat.
Jay turns to Charlie.
JAY MAROTTA
You have to buckle the seat
in, man, it’s the law.

CHARLIE
I know that. I thought the
car rental place did it.

JAY MAROTTA
They can’t do it, it’s a
liability--

CHARLIE
I know that NOW! Once we
discovered that, we fixed
it.

The judge wipes his runny nose and interrupts-JUDGE
(to Jay and Nora)
Counsel, you can see my courtroom
is full and there are people who
don’t have the resources your
clients have. And I’m fairly
certain you haven’t exhausted in
good faith the arguments in the
case of this child. In the
meantime, we’ll keep the status
quo. This remains an LA family
for the time being.
Charlie’s face drops.
JUDGE
I took over this department
recently and am still becoming
acquainted with the cases so I’m
going to appoint an expert
evaluator who knows much more
about young children than I do.
Once the evaluation is done we’ll

You want something to drink?

CHARLIE
I have unfiltered tap water, beer
and some juice boxes.
NICOLE
I’ll have a juice box.
He goes into the kitchen.
It makes her sad.

She looks at his rental place.

You don’t have anything on the

I don’t have anything to put on

being framed.

I can give you some things, you
know until you get some stuff...
How about that great picture of
Henry on the Staten Island Ferry-CHARLIE (O.S.)
Aren’t you in that one?
NICOLE
Oh, right, I guess I am.
(shrugs)
I guess you can cut me out?

CHARLIE (O.S.)
Oh, I’m going to have to
leave a day early to go to
New York on the 22nd so I
was wondering if I could
take Henry that Friday--

NICOLE
The 22nd? So, that’s the 21st?
We have plans actually. We’re
going to this thing at LACMA with
the cousins--

He reappears and hands her a juice box.
CHARLIE
But could you change it so I
can take him-Really?

NICOLE
It’s only that night. He’s
looking forward to it.

CHARLIE

It’s my night, Charlie, we
negotiated it.
(coldly)
OK. Fine.

CHARLIE

NICOLE
I mean...what?

CHARLIE
No, I’m just asking you to be
flexible-NICOLE
I AM flexible. You come in and
out and I adjust based on your
schedule. This one night we
happen to have to have tickets to
a thing. I mean...
CHARLIE
It’s not only this one night, but
fine...
She opens the straw, and uses it to puncture the hole and
sips the drink.

Henry’s teacher wants to meet with
us.
CHARLIE
You mean his LA teacher-NICOLE
Can you respond to the email
so we can set a time?

CHARLIE
Yeah, I’ve been distracted.

I understand. They just want to
rule out everything, you know,

CHARLIE
I think he’s just over-anxious.

NICOLE
I know, he quits too easily
if things aren’t easy for
him. You know, he’s like
us, he’s stubborn.

CHARLIE
They said he’s off the
charts in math.

NICOLE
He’s still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his
money.
Charlie laughs.
So...
Uh huh.

Nicole smiles.
NICOLE
I thought we should talk.

CHARLIE

Uh huh.

NICOLE
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.
CHARLIE

NICOLE
I mean, my mom has taken out a
loan against the house to help me
pay NoraCHARLIE
I thought I pay Nora.
NICOLE
You pay thirty percent of Nora.
CHARLIE
Well, I’m going broke too if
that’s any help. I’ve just agreed
to direct two shitty plays and we
can forget putting anything away
for Henry’s college.
NICOLE
(trying not to take the
bait)
It’s just that...up until now
we’ve been able to keep Henry at
least somewhat removed. And this
will change that.
Uh huh.

CHARLIE

I agree.

NICOLE
And we have to protect him.
CHARLIE

NICOLE
Nora says the evaluator will come
into our homes. She’ll interview
Henry in addition to us, our
family, friends, enemies... And
then she’ll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.
CHARLIE
Sounds awful.
NICOLE
I know! I feel like if anyone
observed me on any given day as a
mom, I’d never get custody.
(pause)
That was a joke.
I know.

CHARLIE
I feel the same way.

NICOLE
(smiles)
Right. So, maybe we can figure
something out between us-CHARLIE
You’ll remember I said this to you
at the beginning.
NICOLE
I know you did, but these are
different circumstances-CHARLIE
I was anticipating these
circumstances--

OK.

NICOLE
Mm hm. Anyway... Shall we
try this?

CHARLIE
(pause)
There’s a long silence.

They both laugh.

CHARLIE
I don’t know how to start...
NICOLE
Do you understand why I want to
stay in LA?
No.

CHARLIE

117.
NICOLE
Well, that’s not...Charlie, that’s
not a useful way for us to start-CHARLIE
I don’t understand it.
NICOLE
You don’t remember promising that
we could do time out here?
CHARLIE
We discussed things. We were
married, we said things. We
talked about moving to Europe,
about getting a sideboard or what
do you call it, a credenza, to
fill that empty space behind the
couch. We never did any of it.
NICOLE
And you turned down that
residency at the Geffen that
would have brought us here
and--

CHARLIE
It wasn’t something I
wanted. We had a great
theater company and a great
life where we were.

NICOLE
You call that a great life.
CHARLIE
You know what I mean.
NICOLE
Me discovering you’re
fucking Mary Ann--

CHARLIE
Don’t pretend you’re not
capable of deception. You
left Ben for ME.

CHARLIE
I don’t mean we had a great
marriage. I mean, life in
Brooklyn... Professionally. I
don’t know. Honestly I never
considered anything different.
NICOLE
Well, that’s the problem isn’t it?
I was your wife, you should have
considered my happiness too.
CHARLIE
Come on! You WERE happy. You’ve
just decided you weren’t now--

118.
NICOLE
(not taking the bait)
So, OK, let’s... I work here now.
My family is here.
CHARLIE
And I agreed to put Henry in
school here because your show went
to series. I did that KNOWING
that when you were done shooting,
he would come back to New York...
NICOLE
Honey, we never said that. That
might have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said
that...
CHARLIE
We did say it.

NICOLE
When did we say it?

CHARLIE
I don’t know when we said it, but
we said it!
I thought--

NICOLE

CHARLIE
(remembering something)
We said it that time on the
phone--

NICOLE
Let me finish. Honey-(hesitates, angry at
herself)
Sorry, I keep saying THAT.
(resumes)
I thought...that if Henry was
happy out here and my show
continued, that we might do LA for
a while.
CHARLIE
I was not privy to that thought
process.
NICOLE
The only reason we didn’t live
here was because you can’t imagine
desires other than your own unless
they’re forced on you.

119.
CHARLIE
OK, you wish you hadn’t married
me, you wish you’d had a different
life. But this is what happened.
NICOLE
(trying to stay calm)
So what do we do?
CHARLIE
I don’t know.
NICOLE
Nora says there’s no coming back
from this.
CHARLIE
Fuck Nora. I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA
even though I never lived in LA.
How could you have her say those
things about me?
NICOLE
Jay said them about me too!
(hesitates)
You shouldn’t have fired Bert.
CHARLIE
I needed my own asshole!
NICOLE
Let’s both agree both of our
lawyers have said shitty stuff
about both of us-CHARLIE
Nora was worse.
NICOLE
Jay called me an alcoholic!

CHARLIE
You pulled the rug out from
under me and you’re putting
me through hell--

NICOLE
You put me through hell
DURING the marriage!

CHARLIE
Is that what that was?
Hell?

NICOLE
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing so you
can yet again get what you want.

120.
CHARLIE
It’s not what I want...I mean,
it’s what I want, but it’s what
was...WAS...what’s best for him.
NICOLE
I was wondering when you’d get
around to Henry and what HE
actually wants.
CHARLIE
Oh, fuck off-NICOLE
No, YOU fuck off. If you listened
to your son, or anyone, he’d tell
you he’d rather live here.
CHARLIE
Stop putting your feelings
about me onto Henry.

NICOLE
He tells me he likes it here
better.

CHARLIE
He tells you because he knows it’s
what you want to HEAR!
NICOLE
He tells me you’re on the phone
all the time. You don’t even play
with him.
CHARLIE
Because I’m going through a
divorce in LA and trying to
direct a play in New York.

NICOLE
You’re fighting for
something you don’t even
WANT.

CHARLIE
Which closed because I wasn’t
THERE! That was a HUGE
opportunity for me. For the
theater. And I let everyone down.
NICOLE
You’re being so much like your
father.
CHARLIE
DO NOT compare me to my father.
NICOLE
I didn’t compare you.
were acting like him.

I said you

121.
CHARLIE
You’re exactly like your mother!
Everything you complain about her,
you’re doing. You’re suffocating
Henry.
NICOLE
First of all, I love my
mother, she was a great
mother!

CHARLIE
I’m just repeating what
you’ve told me--

NICOLE
Secondly, how dare you compare my
mothering to my mother? I might
be like my father, but I’m NOT
like my mother.
CHARLIE
You ARE! And you’re like my
father. You’re also like MY
mother. You’re all the bad things
about all of these people. But
mostly your mother. When we would
lie in bed together, sometimes I
would look at you and see HER and
just feel so GROSS.
NICOLE
I felt repulsed when you touched
me.
CHARLIE
You’re a slob. I made all
the beds, closed all the
cabinets, picked up after
you like an infant--

NICOLE
The thought of having sex
with you makes me want to
peel my skin off.

CHARLIE
You’ll never be happy. In LA or
anywhere. You’ll think you found
some better, opposite guy than me
and in a few years you’ll rebel
against him because you need to
have your VOICE. But you don’t
WANT a voice. You just want to
fucking complain about not having
a VOICE.
NICOLE
I think of being married to you
and that woman is a stranger to
me.

122.
CHARLIE
You’ve regressed. You’ve
gone back to your life
before you met me. It’s
pathetic.

NICOLE
We had a child’s marriage.

NICOLE
People used to say to me that you
were too selfish to be a great
artist. I used to defend you.
But they’re absolutely right.
CHARLIE
All your best acting is
behind you. You’re back to
being a HACK.

NICOLE
You gaslighted me.
fucking villain.

You’re a

CHARLIE
You want to present yourself as a
victim because it’s a good legal
strategy, FINE. But you and I
both know you CHOSE this life.
You wanted it until you didn’t.
Nicole is silent.
CHARLIE
You USED me so you could get out
of LA.
NICOLE
I didn’t use you--

CHARLIE
You did and then you BLAMED
me for it. You always made
me aware of what I was doing
wrong, how I was falling
short.

CHARLIE
Life with you was JOYLESS.
NICOLE
So you had to fuck someone else?
How could you?
CHARLIE
You shouldn’t be upset that I
fucked her, you should be upset
that I had a laugh with her.
NICOLE
Do you love her?

123.
CHARLIE
No! But she didn’t hate me.
hated me.

You

NICOLE
You hated ME. You fucked someone
we worked with.
CHARLIE
You stopped having sex with me in
the last year. I never cheated on
you.
NICOLE
That was cheating on me.
CHARLIE
But there’s so much I could have
done. I was a director in my 20’s
who came from nothing and was
suddenly on the cover of fucking
Time Out New York. I was hot
shit—-and I wanted to fuck
EVERYBODY and I didn’t. And I
loved you and didn’t want to lose
you...and I’m in my twenties and I
didn’t want to lose that too. And
you wanted SO much so fast...I
didn’t even want to get
married...and fuck it, there’s so
much I DIDN’T do.
NICOLE
Well, thanks for that.
CHARLIE
You’re welcome. You’re...welcome.
Nicole stamps her feet and shakes her fists like a child
having a tantrum.
NICOLE
I can’t believe I have to know you
FOREVER!
CHARLIE
You’re fucking insane!
Charlie raises his arm and punches the wall.
wall cracks and chips.
CHARLIE
And you’re fucking winning.

The cheap dry-

124.
NICOLE
Are you kidding? I wanted to be
married. I’d ALREADY LOST.
(sadly)
You didn’t love me as much as I
loved you.
CHARLIE
(pause)
What does that have to do with LA?
Nicole stares at him, incredulous.
What?

CHARLIE

NICOLE
You’re so merged with your
own selfishness that you
don’t even identify it as
selfishness anymore. YOU’RE
SUCH A DICK.

CHARLIE
Every day I wake up and hope
you’re dead-- Dead like-And then Charlie starts crying.
CHARLIE
(through tears)
If I could guarantee Henry would
be OK, I’d hope you get an illness
and then get hit by a car and DIE.
He sinks down, weeping. All this vitriol has taken its
toll. Nicole watches, taken aback. She walks over and
gently puts her hand on his shoulder. He shakes and cries.
I know.

NICOLE
Finally, he looks up at her.
CHARLIE
I’m sorry.
Me too.

NICOLE
SET DESIGNER (V.O.)
Try the chair by the window...

125.
INT. CHARLIE’S RENTAL. DAY
Charlie gets a delivery of rental plates, glasses,
furniture, plants. He stands on his balcony directing the
delivery men.
Charlie set-decorates his rental. He Skypes with Agnes,
his set designer from the theater. Holding out the
computer to show her the apartment.
He buys a stack of board games with Henry.
He and Henry get Henry’s drawings at framer.
They hang the art-work.
HENRY
Why do we have so many plants all
of a sudden?
CHARLIE
We’ll have to return some of this
stuff so don’t get too used to it.
HENRY
My mom is the last person to turn
into a plant on her show.
Yeah?

CHARLIE
HENRY
(nervously touching a
fern)
I find plants kind of scary.
CHARLIE
These plants are good guys.
(hesitates)
Hey, tomorrow this woman is going
to come and visit us and be with
us while we eat dinner.
HENRY
Is it your girlfriend?
No, no...

CHARLIE
HENRY
Mommy’s boyfriend?

126.
CHARLIE
No, why...does Mommy have a
boyfriend?
HENRY
I don’t know. Does she?
CHARLIE
I don’t know.
HENRY
I don’t know. Why is someone
watching us eat dinner?
CHARLIE
I know, it’s weird. It’s just
something we have to do which has
to do with Mommy and me figuring
out everything...and how we’re
going to be and...you know?
HENRY
Will you read to me?
Charlie and Henry lie down on the floor against the blank
wall and Charlie starts reading to him.
EVALUATOR (V.O.)
Any history of domestic violence?
INT. OFFICE. DAY
We STAY on Nicole who sits facing an unseen evaluator.
NICOLE
Oh... No. You mean coming from
me? No. Not coming from him
either...
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
Have you been to prison?
NICOLE
Yes, actually. Well, not prison.
Jail. But it was deliberate.
OK.

EVALUATOR (O.S.)
NICOLE
I was demonstrating as part of a
Grandmothers for Peace rally. I
was with my mom, but she didn’t go
to jail.
(MORE)

127.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
(laughs, remembering)
Somehow she avoided that part.
But I did.
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
Do you use drugs or alcohol?
NICOLE
I drink alcohol.
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
How much alcohol do you drink?
NICOLE
I don’t know. Glass of wine with
dinner. Sometimes more?
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
How much more?
NICOLE
Well, sometimes, a few...
I
sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone?
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
OK. Who do you split it
with?

OK.

EVALUATOR (O.S.)

NICOLE
I mean, if I’m having dinner
with someone and we order a
bottle of wine.
NICOLE
You know, like if you’re at
a restaurant and you say,
“Should we go by the glass
or get a bottle?”

EVALUATOR (O.S.)
You get a bottle.
NICOLE
Sometimes! Sometimes I go by the
glass. You know, it depends...
(hesitates)
Do you mean drugs ever? I have
done drugs. In college. I don’t
do it regularly.
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
Anything since you’ve been a
mother?
NICOLE
Pot a few times. Coke once at a
party. But Henry wasn’t with me.

128.
Silence.
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
What would you say are your
strengths as a parent?
NICOLE
I listen. I play. I put in the
time. I love taking care of him,
watching him grow up... Sometimes
it’s true what they say about it
goes so fast, but sometimes it’s
not. Sometimes it goes too slow,
honestly...
EVALUATOR (O.S.)
What are your weaknesses?
NICOLE
I’m too precise.

I care too much.

EVALUATOR (O.S.)
Are those weaknesses?
NICOLE
(smiles)
Maybe not.
(thinks)
You know what, he can be an
asshole and I can get really
pissed off. I’ll call him on
being an asshole and-NORA (O.S.)
I’m going to stop you there.
Nora stands up from behind the female associate who is
doing the practice interview with Nicole. We’re in Nora’s
office.
NORA
Don’t ever say that. People don’t
accept a mother who drinks too
much wine and yells at her child
and calls him an asshole. I get
it. I do it too.
While she talks she also texts and addresses emails on her
phone.

129.
NORA
We can accept an imperfect Dad.
Let’s face it, the idea of a good
father was only invented like 30
years ago. Before that fathers
were expected to be silent and
absent and unreliable and selfish
and we can all say that we want
them to be different but on some
basic level we ACCEPT them, we
LOVE them for their fallibilities.
But people absolutely DON’T accept
those same failings in mothers.
(building up steam)
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually
because the basis of our JudeoChristian Whatever is Mary Mother
of Jesus and she’s PERFECT. She’s
a virgin who gives birth,
unwaveringly supports her child,
and holds his dead body when he’s
gone. But the Dad isn’t there.
He didn’t even do the fucking
because God’s in heaven. God is
the father and God didn't show up
so you have to be perfect and
Charlie can be a fuck up and it
doesn't matter. You’ll always be
held to a different, higher
standard and it’s FUCKED up, but
that’s the way it is.
INT. CHARLIE'S RENTAL APARTMENT. EVENING
Charlie is cooking an elaborate dinner.
He takes a deep breath.
He glances into Henry’s room.
the floor.

The bell rings.

He’s playing by himself on

He walks through the set-decorated living room which looks
relatively homey, full of warmth and board games and
pictures of Charlie and Henry.
Charlie opens the door. A diminutive woman with frizzy
hair is staring at the door across the hall. She startles,
turns around and smiles and puts out her hand.
EVALUATOR
I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.

130.
CHARLIE
(shaking)
Hi, I’m Charlie Barber.
can I get you anything?

Nancy,

EVALUATOR
Oh, I’m easy. A glass of water?
Kitchen. Charlie opens up a cabinet. Plates. He opens
another cabinet. Pots. A third cabinet. Empty. Finally
he finds glasses in a low cupboard. He glances back at the
evaluator who waits patiently.
CHARLIE
It’s a new apartment.
Charlie and Nancy take their drinks to the dining room
table.
CHARLIE
Shall we go in here?
EVALUATOR
Sure. What’s a day like for the
two of you here?
CHARLIE
Well, if he has school, I take him
there, of course and pick him up,
assuming I can do both.
EVALUATOR
What prevents you from picking him
up?
CHARLIE
Um, you know, work. I’m preparing
a play I’m directing in a few
months.
EVALUATOR
Oh, what is that?
CHARLIE
Kasimir and Karoline by Odon von
Horvath? We’re doing it at the
Barrow in New York.
EVALUATOR
So, you have to be away?

131.
CHARLIE
Yes. Recently, since Nicole has
been working on this show in LA, I
come back and forth a lot.
EVALUATOR
That sounds difficult.
CHARLIE
It is. And expensive. I’ll try
to take him with me some of the
time, but Nicole doesn’t like for
him to fly so much.
EVALUATOR
That can be hard on a child.

All

CHARLIE
(hesitates)
Well, he’s sturdy.
EVALUATOR
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant because of these
super bugs.
Uh huh.

CHARLIE

EVALUATOR
(looking at her notes)
I notice on one visit to Los
Angeles, you came on a
Sunday and left on a
Thursday. Why not stay for
a weekend?

CHARLIE
Oh...on that time, I had tech for
Electra back in New York.
EVALUATOR
What’s that?
CHARLIE
It was my Broadway debut.

EVALUATOR
I don’t know what tech is.

CHARLIE
It’s the technical part of the
production. You figure out the
lights and-EVALUATOR
(moving forward)
And what’s a weekend day
like?

CHARLIE
(still explaining)
Monday is our day off in
theater--

132.
CHARLIE
(discovering his mouth is
dry)
Well, out here he has basketball
on Saturday at 12, 11, I’m sorry
and so we go there.
(swallowing)
And then afterwards, maybe we’ll
get lunch somewhere and then if
there’s a movie to see...
EVALUATOR
Does he like basketball?
CHARLIE
He does. His coach, um, Rick says
he’s a good dribbler and I’ve seen
that...
Uh huh.

EVALUATOR
CHARLIE
Ron. I’m sorry. His coach’s name
is Ron. Rick’s his dentist in New
York.
The evaluator writes something in her book.
CHARLIE
Well, you know our home home
was...is in New York. That’s
where we live and-EVALUATOR
New York is a long way from here.
CHARLIE
We like it because we can walk.
EVALUATOR
You can walk here.
CHARLIE
Not really.
EVALUATOR
And the space.
Charlie nods.
CUT TO: HENRY’S ROOM
Henry plays on the floor.

The evaluator sits in a chair.

133.
EVALUATOR
Do you like your school?
HENRY
I love it.
EVALUATOR
What’s your favorite part about
it?
HENRY
I don’t know. Maybe gym.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
You like math-HENRY
Math is boring.
Charlie enters and hands Henry a plate with cut-up apple.
Henry takes it.
Thanks.

HENRY
CHARLIE
You’re welcome. But you’re
getting really good at it.
No.

HENRY
CHARLIE
Well, you are, but...
Charlie exits.
EVALUATOR
What do you and your Dad like to
do together?
HENRY
When I’m at my Dad’s we sometimes
watch a movie or build a Lego or
something. My Dad’s a great Lego
builder.
Nancy smiles.
HALLWAY
Charlie listening at the door, smiles.

At home, I have most of my toys

Nicole’s.

Henry gets off his chair and goes into-KITCHEN

The evaluator sits

CHARLIE
Why are you being like this?
What?

HENRY
CHARLIE
If I ask you to help out, help
out.
HENRY
(eating something from
the pan)
What is this?
CHARLIE
It’s special meal.
HENRY
What are the green things? There
aren’t green things in special
meal.
CHARLIE
It’s just a garnish.
Uck.

HENRY

CHARLIE
Here, I’ll take it off.

HENRY
I don’t want to eat anything it
touched.
CHARLIE
It doesn’t change the taste of
anything.
HENRY
I might want to be a vegetarian.
Mom’s a vegetarian.
CHARLIE
Is she a vegetarian now?
Yeah.

HENRY
CHARLIE
(prickly)
Well, then you should like
garnish. It’s all garnish,
vegetarianism.

Charlie looks over. Nancy stands, watching, in the
threshold of the kitchen.
EVALUATOR
I’m done with my water.
She returns her water to the sink.
DINING AREA
Charlie and Henry eat.

Nancy sits with them.

CHARLIE
You sure you don’t want anything?
EVALUATOR
No, I’m fine, thank you.
They eat in silence.

HENRY
Do the thing with the knife.
CHARLIE
No...I’m not...no.
Come on!

HENRY
CHARLIE
It’s not a dinner thing.
Silence.
CHARLIE
It’s not an anytime thing.
EVALUATOR
What’s the thing with the knife?
HENRY
It’s hilarious.
CHARLIE
No...it’s dumb. I have a small
knife on my keychain. Which is
only for adults. I do a thing
with it sometimes...

You said I could get a knife.

No! You have “Tuh” and “ime.”
What is that?
Henry takes a piece of tape and puts it on his mouth.
Time.

CHARLIE
It’s time.

He looks at the evaluator. She nods.
onto his front, playing dead.

Henry rolls over

CHARLIE
You’ll see, honey, one day it’s
just going to click and you’ll be
able to read everything.
HENRY
(through the tape)
I need a break. Can I play in my
room?
Sure.

CHARLIE
Charlie tries to kiss him on lips. Henry gives him his
head. Charlie kisses the top of his head. Henry runs out.
Nancy is looking at the crack in the wall from Charlie’s
punch. Charlie clocks this. Silence.
CHARLIE
Do you ever observe married
people?
EVALUATOR
No, why would I?
CHARLIE
I was kidding.
Oh.

EVALUATOR
Silence.
CHARLIE
The knife thing is, I carry this
knife on my keychain which his
mother got me actually--

139.
He takes out his key-ring and shows her the X-Acto knife.
CHARLIE
--and I’d do this thing for his mom-He clicks open the knife.
CHARLIE
Where I pretend to cut myself, but
I retract the blade-He pantomimes cutting his arm.
CHARLIE
But I don’t do it with him...
The evaluator stares at Charlie with horror. Charlie
hesitates and follows her gaze. Dark red blood streams
down his arm.
CHARLIE
Oh...that’s fine.
It’s really bleeding. He covers it with his hand, the
blood spreading between his fingers.
EVALUATOR
Are you OK?
CHARLIE
(casually)
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.
EVALUATOR
Do you need-Blood is getting over everything. He lowers the sleeve on
his oxford shirt to cover the wound. Red blots immediately
soak through the cotton.
CHARLIE
Yeah...yeah. No! I’m fine.
(smiles at her and
crosses his legs)
What else can I tell you?
EVALUATOR
I think I have enough.
CHARLIE
(again trying to talk
casually)
You got enough?

140.
EVALUATOR
(winces)
Are you sure you’re OK?
Totally.

CHARLIE
I’m fine.

Silence.
EVALUATOR
Well, I’ll leave you guys for
tonight.
Oh, OK...

CHARLIE
EVALUATOR
I’ll be in touch if I have further
questions.
She stands and gathers her things while Charlie grabs her
coat from a chair and holds it out to her, his left shirt
arm growing crimson. She takes it, trying to avoid the
blood.
Thanks.

EVALUATOR
She climbs into her coat, Charlie nominally helping out
with his good arm, and moves toward the door.
EVALUATOR
Thank you for the water.
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah, sure.
EVALUATOR
You’re sure you’re OK?
CHARLIE
(too loud)
Yeah!
Bye bye.
Bye.

EVALUATOR
CHARLIE
She tries to open the door, but it’s locked. She turns a
bolt and another latch but it still won’t open.

141.
CHARLIE
Oh, let me-Charlie rushes over and undoes the bolt. She tries to get
out of the way of the blood, while he reaches his long arms
around her to do this, putting them both in a strangely
intimate proximity. He pulls and it won’t open.
CHARLIE
I think you turned-He does the latch and finally it opens.
Sorry.

CHARLIE
She flushes and smiles awkwardly and slips out, closing the
door behind her.
Charlie runs into the kitchen, swaying, leaning against the
wall for support. His shirt is now soaked in blood. He
rolls up his sleeve, and runs cold water on his arm. He
winces. Watery blood fills up the pots and pans in the
sink mixing with whatever bits of remaining food.
He finds a small box of band-aids in the cupboard and opens
about seven of them and tries to cover up the wound. But
it’s still really bleeding. He wraps his arm in paper
towels, sweat now sliding down his face and soaking his
armpits. He drops to the kitchen floor and lies down on
his back in exhaustion and pain.
Two small bare feet step over him and pad over to the
refrigerator.
HENRY
Dad, are you OK?
CHARLIE
Yeah, I’m just tired.
Charlie rolls over onto his arm, hiding it from Henry. The
sound of milk being poured into a glass. Then the feet reapproach and step back over Charlie. Little drips of milk
whiten the floor.
HENRY
(sleepily)
Dad, did she like us?
CHARLIE
(from the floor)
Yeah, she thought we were great.

Fade to Black.
INT. NICOLE’S NEW PLACE. ECHO PARK, LA. DAY
Cassie, Sandra and Nicole sing “You Could Drive a Person
Crazy” from the musical, Company -- The tight harmonies are
sung a capella, and there are dance moves to go along with
it.
The group of people watching includes kids and an agent,
cast and crew from her show and family -- it’s a
housewarming party.
(The house looks very different from the home she shared
with Charlie. More color, more patterns, more hippy-dippy,
more lamps, more her. It’s how she likes it.)
They finish their song and everyone applauds, kind of to be
polite, but also because it was seriously, strangely great.
INT. NICOLE’S KITCHEN. LATER
Nora pops the cork on a big bottle of Cristal.
Nicole is getting food together for the guests, pulling
saran wrap off platters. She leaves cabinet doors open
which she maneuvers around. Kids run through the room
playing. Guests enter to grab drinks, etc.
NORA
I want your mom!
NICOLE
Oh really? Yeah-Nora makes a heart symbol with her hands and leaps up on
the kitchen counter, swinging her feet and drinking
champagne like a teenager.
NORA
So, because Charlie dropped his
claim to New York, we’re mostly
done. Jay’s lost interest and
Ted, his associate, is doing the
paper work.
NICOLE
And we’re not taking any money,
right?

143.
NORA
We withdrew the claim for the
MacArthur, which I think we could
have gotten by the way, and
they’re not asking for any of the
show.
NICOLE
(clinking glasses)
OK, good. Thank you for
everything, Nora
NORA
You’re welcome, doll.
(pause)
And when Charlie’s in LA, I got
the custody breakdown to be 55/45,
so you’ll have Henry one extra day
every two weeks...
NICOLE
I thought we made it equal.
NORA
I tweaked it at the last minute.
I just didn’t want him to be able
to say he got 50/50.
NICOLE
But I don’t--

NORA
Bragging to his friends.

NICOLE
--want to do that.
Take it!

NORA
You won.

Uh huh.

I’m sorry. This is all so selfpitying and boring.

Oh, no, no, sounds really

No, it’s sad.

No, it’s all stupid.

The piano player plays the opening notes of a song.
Charlie recognizes it.

He gets up and walks to the piano.
People know who he is, and are intrigued to see what he’s

EXT./INT. SANDRA’S HOUSE, WEST HOLLYWOOD, LOS ANGELES. DAY
Charlie gets out of his rental car.
He knocks on the back door. No answer. He apprehensively
opens the screen door to the kitchen. Food is on the
stove. Music plays. It’s warm and welcoming.
But Charlie remains in the threshold.
Hello?

CHARLIE
He hears laughter from the other rooms.

Hello?

CARTER
You’ll never take me!

Hi.

Sorry, the door was open.

Carter puts his finger up to his lips.
Shhh.
Oh...OK.

The electronic sound of something bad happening. Carter’s
been hit in laser tag. Sandra runs in holding a gun.
SANDRA
I got you!
She hesitates when she sees Charlie.
SANDRA
Charlie, hi.
She comes forward and hugs him. It isn’t cold
particularly, but it isn’t what it was. Carter extends his
hand.
Carter.
Charlie.

CARTER
CHARLIE
CARTER
Nicole’s still at work.
Silence.

Then Henry enters.
Hi.
Hi.

CHARLIE
HENRY
CHARLIE
Can I get a hug?
Henry hugs Charlie.

Charlie smiles at everyone awkwardly.

CUT TO: Charlie, Sandra and Carter talk at the dining room
table. Nicole arrives from filming her show. Carter
rises, they kiss.
CARTER
How’d it go?
NICOLE
Good. Donny’s dead now. I shot
the scene where he merges with the
ficus.
Charlie grins.
CARTER
She got an Emmy nomination!

147.
CHARLIE
She’s a great actress.
NICOLE
No, for directing!
Charlie nods, a bit stunned.
CHARLIE
Congratulations.
NICOLE
I love it. Now I know what you
were so obsessed with all the
time.
(moving)
We should get ready!
(to Charlie)
We’re the Beatles.
Everyone clomps upstairs.

Charlie follows.

CHARLIE
I didn’t really get a costume
together.
CARTER
You can be George Martin.
CHARLIE
I don’t need to be anything.
CARTER
You got to be something--

NICOLE
At least a ghost! I’ll get
you a sheet--

Sandra and Carter hurry into different rooms, getting
ready. Nicole enters into the bathroom.
NICOLE (O.S.)
We should leave soon! I’m saying
that as much for me as anyone
else.
CHARLIE
I wanted to tell you, I took a
residency at UCLA. I’m going to
direct two plays in rep at Red
Cat.
Nicole reenters holding a sheet.
Oh...

NICOLE

148.
CHARLIE
So, I’ll be here for a while.
NICOLE
That’s great.
But something strikes her as sad about it too.
You OK?
Yeah.

CHARLIE
NICOLE
It’s only good.

Sandra calls her for help with her costume. Nicole hands
Charlie the sheet and goes into the next room. Charlie,
alone, inspects the sheet. He notices the photos on the
wall have been swapped out with different ones. He hears:
HENRY (O.S.)
“Charlie is...in...cr...” -something -- ”neat and I re-ly on
him to keep things in or-der.
He’s energy con...” -- I don’t
know what that word is -Charlie drifts towards Henry’s room.
Henry, legs dangling off his bed, reads from a crinkled
loose leaf paper.
CHARLIE
You’re getting so good at reading.
(beat)
What is that?
HENRY
“He doesn’t look in the mirror too
of-ten. He cries eas-ily in
movies...”
Charlie hesitates and sits next to Henry on the bed.
HENRY
“He is very self-suf--”
CHARLIE
Self-sufficient.
HENRY
“--he can dar-n a sock--”

149.
CHARLIE
That means sew, like a hole--

HENRY
“--and cook himself dinner
and ir--”

CHARLIE
Break it into two parts.

HENRY
CHARLIE
Not “ur” but “ire”
Ire.
Iron.

HENRY
CHARLIE
HENRY
“--a shirt. He rarely gets defeated (which I fell...feel like I
al-ways do). Charlie takes all of
my moods stead-ily, he doesn’t
give in to them or make me feel

dress-er, he never looks em--” I
don’t know this one...
CHARLIE
Embarrassing.
Nicole appears in the doorway.
HENRY
“--embarrassing wh-ich is hard for
a man.” You read it now...
He hands it to Charlie.

Charlie reads:

CHARLIE
“He loves being a dad, he loves
all the things you’re supposed to
hate, like the tantrums, the
waking up at night-- He
disappears into his own world. He
and Henry are alike in that way.
He can tell people they have food
in their teeth or on their face in
a way that doesn’t make them feel
bad. Charlie is self-made -- his
parents -- I only met them once -but he told me there was-(MORE)

150.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(Charlie skips ahead for
Henry’s benefit)
He’s brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around. With the
theatre company he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.
No one, not even an intern was
unimportant.”
HENRY
What’s an intern?
CHARLIE
Like a helper. But who isn’t
paid.
HENRY
Why aren’t they paid?
CHARLIE
They’re young. They’re
learning... I don’t know, maybe
if they do a good job, they get
paid later?
OK.

HENRY
Keep going.

CHARLIE
“He could remember all the inside
jokes. He’s extremely organized
and thorough. He’s very clear
about what he wants unlike me who
can’t always tell. I fell in love
with him two seconds after I saw
him and I’ll never stop loving
him...”
Charlie hesitates.

He swallows.

He’s crying.

CHARLIE
“...even though it doesn’t make
sense anymore.”
EXT. PASADENA RESIDENTIAL STREETS, LA, LATE DAY
Henry, Nicole, Carter, Sandra are dressed as the Beatles
from Sgt. Pepper. Carter is Paul. Henry is Ringo. Nicole
is John. Sandra is George. Charlie’s a ghost. They’re
joined by Cassie and Sam and their kids, also dressed up.
The kids run from house to house trick-or-treating.
The adults linger and talk casually.

151.
Henry, exhausted, is having trouble keeping his eyes open.
Nicole regards him. Charlie, his sheet on his arm now, is
saying goodbye to the family as Sandra takes off with
Cassie and Sam. He shakes Carter’s hand, it’s friendly.
Nicole hesitates then approaches Charlie.
NICOLE
We were going to bring him to
dinner, but he’s wiped out. Do
you want to take him?
CHARLIE
(taken aback)
It’s your night...
I know.
Yeah.
OK, good.

NICOLE
CHARLIE
NICOLE
CHARLIE
I’ll drop him back in the
morning?

NICOLE
Yeah, just text when you’re
up and we’ll figure it out.

NICOLE
(leaning down to Henry)
You’re going to go with your Dad,
OK?
OK.

HENRY
The boy wraps his arms around his Dad’s neck and Charlie
lifts him.
NICOLE
I love you, sweetheart.
HENRY
I love you.
She kisses Henry’s face which rests on Charlie’s shoulder
and for a moment all three of their heads are nestled close
together. Then Nicole releases.
Charlie, holding Henry, advances toward his parked car.
Nicole watches.
Wait--

Charlie hesitates as Nicole hurries after him.
down in the middle of the street.

She kneels

CLOSE: Charlie’s laces spill out on the pavement.
She tugs on one which he’s stepping on.
Can you--

She taps his calf.

NICOLE
He lifts up his foot so she can retrieve the lace.
She ties his sneaker.

Charlie watches.

CHARLIE
(smiles)
Thanks.
She nods. He hikes Henry up tighter in his arms and
continues toward his car. Nicole and Carter get in their
parked Subaru in the foreground.
The Subaru drives toward us and off-camera and then reappears
heading away from us now. As they pass Charlie and Henry, an
arm waves out the window. Charlie raises his hand back.
Nicole’s car heads into the distance. Charlie stops at his
rental and digs for the keys in his pocket. Henry holds on.
All of them, Nicole and Charlie and Henry, are now recessed
into the landscape. The light is waning. We hold on the
wide tableau of the LA street and finally cut to black.
End.
