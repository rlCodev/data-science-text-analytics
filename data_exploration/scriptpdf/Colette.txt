EXT. BURGUNDIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SUNRISE - 1892

1

The first light is breaking over the fields and hedges of
this timeless rural landscape. With the clanking of bells,
a herd of cows makes its way to the first milking.
2

INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

2

The room is simple with a few sticks of worn wooden
furniture. A young woman is asleep under the covers, with a
cat curled up on the bottom of the bed. This is GABRIELLESIDONIE COLETTE, or as she will later be known, simply
COLETTE.
A voice calls from down the corridor - her mother SIDO.
SIDO (O.S.)
Gabrielle!
The girl stirs but her eyes remain stubbornly closed.
SIDO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Gabrielle!! Wake up.
COLETTE
(murmuring)
Let me sleep!
SIDO
Come on, Gabrielle!!
Sido is now at the door frame. A handsome country woman,
forthright and practical - nobody’s fool.
COLETTE
What time is it?
SIDO
It’s 8 o’clock. Willy is coming today.
Colette just murmurs.
SIDO (cont’d) (CONT’D)
Good. Then you won’t want your
hair doing.
She disappears. After a moment, a head emerges from under
the pillow and looks to the empty doorway. We get our first
look at the milky skinned, precocious, whip-smart, Colette.

EXT. COUNTRY TRAIN STATION - DAY

3

A train belches steam as it slowly moves toward the station.
A MAN IN A TOP HAT leans out of the window.

EXT. TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY

Dismounting, Willy sees a waiting carriage across the platform.
6

INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - PARLOR

6

Wearing her best frock, Colette carries a large TEA SERVICE
down a corridor and into the main room. Willy is seated, in
conversation with Sido and JULES, the patriarch, an affable
old soldier, with one leg, who is smoking a pipe.
JULES
And how is Paris these days,
Willy?
WILLY
It’s a hot bed! It’s “Electric!”
Heaving with artists, writers,
poets, all seeking to say
something profound... most of them
are too young or crazed but still,
they do generate a certain... life
force!
Colette, her hair neatly plaited, puts the cups out for
everyone then takes over the teapot and pours.
JULES
We were going to see a play in
Paris - weren’t we?
La Tosca.

SIDO
WILLY
I was at the opening. I wouldn’t
bother, quite frankly. Sarah Bernhardt
did her best, she always does, but the
piece is too overwrought in a
particularly feminine way...
melodramatic in extremis! Tears on the
stage but all dry eyes in the house.
SIDO
Maybe I’ll go and make up my own mind.
WILLY
Well, just remember... if a book bores
you, you can throw it away. If a
painting is garish, you close your
eyes.

WILLY (CONT'D)
Whereas bad theatre is like dentistry;
you are compelled to stay in the chair,
having your skull drilled, until the
entire grizzly procedure is over.
JULES
Good point, Willy. Painful business!
COLETTE
Though I imagine it must hold a secret
source of enjoyment - for the dentist.
Willy raises an appreciative eyebrow and chuckles.
WILLY
Indeed... Oh - I almost forgot. A
small gift.
He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small package. She
unwraps it to find a SNOW GLOBE OF PARIS.
COLETTE
Thank you. I’ve read about these.
Shake it.

WILLY
She does and looks, fascinated, at the twirling flakes.
COLETTE
Look, Sido. A snow globe.
She holds it up for her mother.

EXT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE – LATE AFTERNOON

7

M. Willy bids good-bye to Jules, Sido and Colette, before
the carriage moves off. Colette is holding her comfortable
old cat which she hands off to her mother.
COLETTE
Sido, I’m going for a walk.
SIDO
Change your dress first.
COLETTE
I’ll stay on the path.
SIDO
Change it!

INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - STAIRS - MINUTES LATER

Now in a different dress, Colette starts to come down stairs.
Hearing her parents talking in the kitchen, she slows up,
listening carefully.
SIDO (O.S.)
There’s something about him I find
suspect... something disingenuous.
JULES (O.S.)
Oh, not in my reckoning... He’s a
good man. He has a reputation,
yes, but there comes a time in a
man’s life to settle down...and
she’s the right age for it. She’ll
be twenty next time around.
SIDO (O.S.)
I just worry that he won’t
understand her. That girl said her
first word at nine months. She was
always reading, way ahead of her
class, she was the lead in the
school play - every year.
JULES (O.S.)
My dear, would anyone be good
enough for you?
Hmmph.

SIDO

Now on the ground floor Colette waits outside the door as
her parents talk. Sido moves into view by the kitchen sink.
SIDO (CONT’D)
Have you finished the letter to
his father?
JULES
I keep starting but I can’t seem
to finish it. A girl without a
dowry, -that just doesn’t happen
in their circles. They may cut him
off if he marries her.
SIDO
So they call it off. The world
won’t end.
As her father talks, Colette sneaks back up the last five
stairs...

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

5.

JULES
Sido, he clearly adores her - he’s
visited four times. He’ll give her
status, not to mention a
tremendous cultural life - the
theater, the opera. He’ll give her
Paris for heaven’s sakes!
Colette comes clumping down the stairs, slightly too loudly
and into the room.
COLETTE
Can I go now?
SIDO
Yes. Take this - for blackberries.
(hands her a pot)
I’m making a tart tomorrow. And
don’t be late back.
COLETTE
(eye roll)
I won’t...
Sido watches her daughter, not without suspicion, as she
takes off across the garden.
9

EXT. SAINT-SAUVEUR – COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

9

Colette runs down a path, then backs up, picks a few prime
blackberries, and continues on.
She moves through the woods, with the stealth of an animal
then breaks out across a broad green meadow towards a barn.
10

EXT. OLD BARN – LATE AFTERNOON

10

She approaches the gaping black door of a dilapidated barn.
11

INT. OLD BARN

11

Entering the darkness, Colette blinks to re-adjust her
eyes. A flutter of wings attracts her attention. She turns
to see an ascending pigeon. Then, below, a tired old horse.
COLETTE
Where are you?
WILLY
Over here. Enjoying the simple
pleasures of country life!
Behind a partition, she sees Willy, reclining on a pile of
straw.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
COLETTE
You look at home in the hay.
WILLY
I think I might be! And you look like
a beautiful young country girl. Right
there. With the light...What’s that?
Colette shows him, putting the bowl between them as she
nestles beside him. Her hands are blue with the juice.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Your fingers are stained.
(he takes her hand)
Mm... Maybe I could just leave
Paris behind.
(he takes a blackberry)
You could feed me berries. I’d catch
a fish with my teeth. Then come back
here to my cave. Like a bear. Bliss.
COLETTE
I’d like that.
WILLY
(he caresses her braids)
Your hair is a phenomenon.
COLETTE
In the village, they call me “the
girl with the hair.”
WILLY
I can see why. I’m sure you’re famous
here in your village.
A little.

COLETTE

She looks down.
COLETTE (cont’d) (CONT’D)
How long until your train goes?
WILLY
In about 40 minutes. But I have
to walk to the station.
COLETTE
Normally takes me about 15
minutes. Will probably take you
20.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

7.

WILLY
Yes. Right. So if my
calculations are correct...
COLETTE
We have time - if we’re quick.
WILLY
Yes, we do.
He smiles, moved by her beauty, kisses her, then breaks
off.
What?

COLETTE
WILLY
I just can’t say how unimaginably
happy I am, Gabrielle.
So am I.

COLETTE
He holds her by her shoulders firmly.
WILLY
I adore you.
He kisses her shoulder. Feeling his beard brush against her
skin, Colette smiles as they move into a passionate embrace. A
nearby horse chews hay as they proceed to take their clothes
off.
11A

INT. COLETTE’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

11A

Colette sprawls out on the bed, her hair in plaits. She is
writing a letter in a school exercise book in pencil, resting
on an encyclopaedia.
COLETTE
Dear Willy, As I walked home by the
river, the light shining through
the trees, my heart filled with a
kind of delicious pride. After all,
you know all those fine women of
Paris...so I must have something.
(smiles to herself))
I want to wake up next to you.
Trace your profile with my finger
while you sleep. Know that the day
is ours. That life is ours for the
taking. We will be so entire and
so happy, my love.

GARDEN - AFTERNOON

At the Wedding Party, Jules is making a toast Colette and
Willy in front of a MIXED CROWD of WEDDING GUESTS.
JULES
It’s the proudest time in a father’s
life, but also - I now find - one of
the saddest. I have to hand over my
beloved daughter, who has lit up our
lives for so long, with her wit, her
brilliance, her beauty. I will miss
you, Gabrielle. Almost as much as
your mother will...
A murmur of acknowledgement from the assembled. Colette
smiles at her father, and catches her mother’s eye, holding
back emotion.
JULES (CONT’D)
But it is no small compensation that I
give her to a man of such inestimable
standing. There are many celebrities
in Paris but few are famous enough to
be known by -- by a single name.
WILLY - Welcome to the Colette family.
Everyone cheers.

Colette turns to her new husband,

A COUPLE OF PEASANTS carry trays of drinks from a kitchen
tent to the GUESTS. Some CHILDREN chase a chicken through the

WILLY (cont’d)
This is definitely a country wedding.
COLETTE
It’ll make a good story -- in Paris.
WILLY
You’ll be the story in Paris,
Gabrielle. Just wait ‘til they
get a look at you.
Willy twirls Colette round and round and round...

EXT. CITY OF PARIS - EVENING - 1893

13

Across the river Seine - the center of the demi-monde; the
Left Bank. This is not postcard Paris - the buildings are
sooty and chimneys are filling the sky with smoke. On the
quay, PEOPLE go about their business as a YOUNG ATTENDANT
lights the gas lamp.
14

INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - BOUDOIR - EVENING

14

MATILDE, the maid, is winching Colette into a very tight
red froufrou dress. A knock on the door.
WILLY (O.S)
Are you ready yet?
COLETTE
No - not yet.
(to the maid)
What do you think, Matilde?
MATILDE
It’s pretty, Madame.
Colette looks at herself critically.
15

INT. BEDROOM/HALLWAY

15

Willy returns and prepares to knock again.
WILLY (O.S)
We should try to get there before
it ends.
COLETTE (O.S.)
I’m coming...
The door opens. Colette is in another dress - the one from
their meeting in Saint-Sauveur. Matilde hovers nervously.
COLETTE (CONT’D)
Is the carriage waiting?
Willy looks disappointed but together they proceed through
SEVERAL ROOMS to the front door. We get a feeling for Willy’s
apartment - a warren of dark rooms overcrowded by boxes, papers
and Wagnerian bric-a-brac. Willy, it seems, is a hoarder.
WILLY
Where’s your new dress?
COLETTE
It looks ridiculous. I couldn’t
breathe in it.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

10.

WILLY
That thing cost me two hundred and
thirty-seven francs.
COLETTE
I know. We’ll get it adjusted.
WILLY
(half joking)
More money!
They exit.
16

EXT. ELEGANT PARISIAN STREET – EARLY EVENING

16

The carriage pulls up. Colette is fiddling with a spot of
tooth powder on her dress.
WILLY
What is it?
COLETTE
...It’s tooth paste.
WILLY
(amused)
My God! Here...
He rubs a little spit on it.
WILLY (CONT’D)
That’ll do. Let’s go in...
17

INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON – HALLWAY

17

They approach the giant door.
WILLY
Ready for the lions...?
She lets out a nervous exhale. The double doors glide open.
18

INT. MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - MAIN ROOM

18

Willy and Colette proceed into a reception room filled with
the beautiful, the sparkling, and the eccentric of Paris’
Golden Age. The mirrors have been polished; so have the
epigrams. Amidst the gas lamps, the India rubber plants,
and the zebra skin rugs, the energy is bouncing off the
walls.
Willy acknowledges hellos and nods to people along the way.
With her tight braids and country dress, Colette looks drab
in this sea of peacocks.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

11.

They arrive at a circle of conversation -- that of MME. DE
CAILLAVET, the hostess, the debonair COUNT MUFFAT, and a
few SALONITES and FRIENDS.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
It’s monstrous. I can’t look at
it.
COUNT MUFFAT
At least it’s temporary.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
Oh here’s Willy -- Willy! Eiffel’s
Tower, are you for or against?
WILLY
I’m for it, if a little jealous of this
giant erection in the heart of our
capital... belonging to someone else.
Laughter from the circle.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
You rogue, Willy. And you’ve
brought a... an orphaned relative?
COUNT MUFFAT
A secret love child?
WILLY
(acknowledging their mockery)
Very good... May I present to you
my wife, Gabrielle-Sidonie
Colette.
Colette curtsies politely, her cheeks flushing.
COLETTE
Pleased to meet you.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
Delighted. Well, astonished
actually. You have caught the
slipperiest eel... How does one do
that?
COLETTE
I’m not sure...
Colette smiles, a little nervously.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
Where are you from, you sweet thing?

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

12.

COLETTE
I’m from Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye...
(no reaction)
...it’s in Burgundy.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
Hence the dress!
COUNT MUFFAT
Have you ”relocated,” Willy?
This is apparently hilarious and there is laughter.
MME. DE CAILLAVET
Tst...ignore him... But how on
earth did you two meet?
COLETTE
Our fathers served together in the army...
COUNT MUFFAT
(riding over her)
Willy married! The wild days are done,
eh?
COLETTE
You’re quite mistaken, sir. The
wild days have just begun.
Willy smiles at his new bride’s moxie. A business-like
young man rushes up to Willy. This is PIERRE VEBER.
VEBER
Willy, thank God you’re back. That
short story for La Forgue –
WILLY
Pierre. Let me introduce you to my
wife, Gabrielle.
VEBER
What..? Very pleased to meet you.
Before she can speak, he turns to Willy with a more urgent tone.
VEBER (CONT’D)
It’s due on Tuesday and you
haven’t given me the slightest
clue.
WILLY
Amuse yourself for a moment, Gabrielle.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

I will.

13.

COLETTE
Willy draws Veber aside to continue the shop talk.
WILLY
It’s simple - an eight hundred word
sketch. Small coastal resort, damp
bathing-costumes. The perfect place to
rejuvenate a de-iodized constitution.
A buxom girl approaches, long legs...
Colette is left standing by herself. Nearby, a silver tray
displays a living turtle with an exquisitely jeweled shell.
She takes a lettuce leaf from a salad dish and feeds it.
COLETTE
Poor thing. You want the earth and
the grass don’t you?
Across the room she sees Willy, with Veber, lifting the glass
on a wall candle and lighting a cigar.
Feeling out of sorts, she moves through to an adjacent room
where...
19

INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON – MUSIC ROOM

19

A STRING QUARTET is giving a recital to the assembled.
Across the room a group of SALONITES are clearly discussing
her. Embarrassed, Colette finds an empty seat. She looks
across the room - the salonites are still whispering.
SCHWOB
Are your ears burning?
Colette looks up and sees - Marcel SCHWOB, an intellectual
with a humane gleam in his eye. He sits next to her.
SCHWOB (CONT’D)
I’m Schwob, a friend of Willy’s.
COLETTE
Hello. I’m Gabrielle. Willy
described you to me.
SCHWOB
I hope he was kind.
COLETTE
(wryly)
Hope costs nothing.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

14.

Schwob raises an amused eyebrow, then looks out into the
room where people are stealing glances at them.
SCHWOB
The modern day mob, aren’t they?
(Colette nods)
But their goddess is gossip instead of the
guillotine. Are you feeling overwhelmed?
A little.

COLETTE
SCHWOB
They may look grand and intimidating.
But just imagine them shitting. Each
and every one of them.
Colette looks at him, incredulous.
SCHWOB (CONT’D)
Well they all do, don’t they?
Across the room, AN IMPORTANT-LOOKING GENTLEMAN, waves to
Schwob.
SCHWOB (CONT’D)
(to the Gentleman)
Good evening, Sir!
(to Colette)
Try it.
AEROPLANE VERSION
SCHWOB (CONT’D)
They may look grand and
intimidating. But just imagine
them perched over a chamber pot.
Each and every one of them.
20

INT. MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - VARIOUS ROOMS

20

We follow Colette as she searches for Willy in the sea of
SOCIALITES. She walks through rooms where PEOPLE are now
dancing in an avant garde fashion then through a series of
SMALLER COMPARTMENTS, where SERVANTS are polishing glasses
and CHEFS are preparing hors d’oeuvres, past palms and oil
lamps, to a distant room at the far end of the salon.
21

INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON – SMOKING ROOM
From the doorway, Colette spies Willy leaning on the
mantelpiece talking to a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a red
dress. The woman leans in close to him, laughing. He
whispers something and she laughs even harder.

21

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

15.

There's a shrieking coming from the corner of the main room.
Colette turns to sees the crowd laughing as a BOHEMIAN pours
milk into an upright piano.
22

INT. HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE – MOVING – NIGHT

22

Colette looks out the window into the night-time streets.
After a moment, Willy ventures a question.
WILLY
So what did you think of the
salon?
WILLY (CONT’D)
That was essentially - what you
witnessed tonight - everyone who’s
anyone in Paris...
Was it..?

COLETTE
WILLY
Who did you like? Who did you talk to?
COLETTE
I liked the tortoise. I think he
was as bored as I was.
WILLY
I suspect you were more
intimidated than bored?
COLETTE
No. I found them...shallow. Pretentious.
WILLY
Ah, you're reading them wrongly. It’s
not pretension so much as
exaggeration. The ideal is to be
authentic yet larger than life. To
present a personality with a capital
P. You could do it too with your
country girl charm ...
She turns to him.
COLETTE
(interrupting)
Did that woman have a capital P?
WILLY
Which one?

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

16.

COLETTE
The one you were talking to? In
the red dress. With the breasts?
WILLY
Nicole D’Allier? That was just...
flirtation. It means absolutely
nothing.
COLETTE
Then why do it?
WILLY
It’s what one does... to pass the time.
It staves off boredom. You’re reading
it all completely wrong.
Colette sighs, frustrated. Willy changes tack.
Maybe...

COLETTE

WILLY
Forget about all of them now. Any way haven’t you heard the news? Willy is
married. Happily married. And he’s
going home with his bride, who he
loves very much.
Colette nods, looks at him with a half-smile.
23

He is forgiven.

EXT. PARIS STREET

23

The carriage rides off into the distance.
24

INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - MORNING

24

From directly above, we see Pierre Veber dash up the
stairs.
25

INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE ROOM

25

Colette is seated at a desk, carefully roughing out a
letter.
She writes a line then crosses it out, rephrases
it.
There’s a knock at the door. Veber enters in the hallway
and looks through to Colette’s small room where she sits
with a large pile of correspondence.
COLETTE
Hello, Veber.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

17.

VEBER
Gabrielle. It’s cold out there today.
COLETTE
I’m under house arrest so it
doesn’t affect me.
(gestures to the other room)
Schwob’s already in there.
We follow Veber through the maze-like apartment to Willy’s
office. He passes through the front room which is semi-dark,
its furniture covered by dust sheets.
26

26

INT. WILLY’S STUDY

Willy, mid-flow, barely notices Veber enter. Schwob sits by
an oil lamp, taking notes.
WILLY
So something like...”all the humor and
vivacity descends into...a dreadful
melodramatic swamp! Or... it released
the toxins of man’s very soul, leaving
the audience pale, and nauseous as
though having eaten a bad oyster.”
SCHWOB
It’s a bit extreme. The ending was
actually quite touching.
Willy thinks for a moment.
WILLY
Hmmph - I prefer my version.
He finally acknowledges the new arrival.
Veber!

WILLY (CONT’D)
VEBER
Willy. Schwob.
WILLY
(to Schwob)
So drop in those embellishments
and file it at The Echo before
six.
SCHWOB
Will do.
(he leaves.)

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
The factory’s on fire... We’re on
fire...! Sit. I’ve had a
remarkable idea - it could be,
anyway...
VEBER
What is it?
WILLY
I’m going to launch a novel.
What?!

VEBER
WILLY
We’ve had stories by Willy, music
reviews by Willy. Now Willy’s first
novel. There’ll be enough literature
in it to appeal to the high-brows and
enough filth for the great unwashed.
VEBER
And who’s going to write it?
WILLY
...You are!
Veber shakes his head, absorbing this.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Brandy? Cigar?
27

INT. ENTRANCE ROOM
Schwob stops to chat to Colette by the desk. Matilde is
stoking the fire.
SCHWOB
Are you writing for him too? He’s
made you one of his ghosts
already?
COLETTE
Just letters...
SCHWOB
You’re fastidious... exacting.
COLETTE
A lot of crossing out, you mean.
SCHWOB
...well, yes.

COLETTE
Willy copies them out afterwards so they are in his handwriting.
MATILDE
No one has handwriting like M. Willy.
28

INT. WILLY’S STUDY

28

Willy is completely absorbed in his pitch, sweat beading
from his forehead as he paces.
WILLY
He first sees her, Monna, held aloft on
the shoulders of her admirers.. She’s
eighteen, beautiful, wild and she’s from
the streets, eats men up, never wears a
corset. And our hero, Renaud - a writer,
a genius - he’s captivated by her. She
seduces him in her shabby rooms - five
entire days of carnal bliss - but she has
a powerful hold over him. She
instinctively understands his base
desires. We wonder - will Renaud escape go back to his wholesome friends and his
burgeoning career - or will he be dragged
down by her toxic embrace, forgetting all
about writing to live forever in a sexual
quagmire..?
Willy ends with a flourish, eyes slightly damp.
29

INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT
Colette gets up from her desk, as Willy escorts Veber
through the apartment.
WILLY
How long do you think it will
take?
VEBER
Two or three months?
WILLY
No no...weeks, Veber! It has to be weeks!
Write for four hours at a time...
VEBER
All right... I’ll come back to you if
I get stuck.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
Yes...Just write it...and fast!
Let’s get some money coming in.
VEBER
Goodbye, Gabrielle.
She waves. The door closes on Veber. A piece of wallpaper
has pulled free of the wall. Willy rubs it back in place.
WILLY
Chaos. Working in these
conditions. Absolute...chaos.
Willy comes over to his wife and kisses her as they walk
back into the front room.
WILLY (CONT’D)
You’ve married a literary
entrepreneur. What a phenomenal
disaster.
COLETTE
You’ve married a country girl. Not a
penny to her name.
WILLY
We’re utterly doomed aren’t we?
They both laugh. She hands him the rough draft of the
letter. He peruses it quickly.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Perfect... but how about; “The
contract you have sent me seems
eminently fair, with only one
shortcoming - the money.” Always
pump something up before you prick
it. You get more of a “POP” that
way.
Unexpectedly, Willy farts.
Willy!

COLETTE
WILLY
Intimacy in all its savage
abandon, my love! I’ve a few
meetings today. Let’s meet at La
Mascotte at nine. No make it ten.
COLETTE
...Goodbye Willy.

EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

Colette walks across the courtyard, up the stairs, across a

There’s the sound of a woman’s raucous laughter. Colette

instinctively grabs a pair of dressmakers scissors.
WILLY
Ah, my dear. You’ve come to fetch

WILLY
She’s not a disreputable woman.
There’s even a play about her - it’s a
shit play but nevertheless... I wonder
who the hell wrote that letter?
COLETTE
I don’t care who wrote it.
WILLY
She’s no rival to you, Gabrielle.
I promise, I’ll never sleep with
her again. But - you have to
understand - this is what men do.
We are the weaker sex. We don’t
have your strength. We are simply
slaves to our urges. And here in
the city - it’s perfectly
acceptable to...
Colette flies at him with inarticulate rage.
COLETTE
I don’t accept it! You’ve been lying to
me. All this time! I wait for you all day
long! And I never ask you for anything
because you say we have no money.
WILLY
It’s true - we have no money.
COLETTE
Because you spend it all on her!
WILLY
I really don’t!
COLETTE
Then when you get into our bed...and I
touch you...and I kiss you...and you say
you’re too tired...every night...no! No!
WILLY
I’ve been inattentive. I’ll make amends.

She spits out the words with such venom that they bring him

Sido and Colette are hanging out laundry. Colette seems to
be only half-listening - her mind is elsewhere.
SIDO
...the Laurent girl had her baby
last week. It was over nine
pounds, but she managed well
enough. She called her “Monique
Françoise.” The christening is
next month. Oh, and the Durands
moved away.
COLETTE
Really? Why?
SIDO
He inherited a house. In Lorraine.
I’ll miss them.
Colette manages a half smile.
SIDO (CONT’D)
I’m glad that you’re home. How
long do you think you’ll stay?
COLETTE
I don’t know, Sido.
SIDO

SIDO
You must eat something.
COLETTE
I’m not hungry.
SIDO
You’re always hungry.

No. I’ll eat later.
Sido turns to leave but looks back at Colette.

Colette and Sido are kneeling together in the soil. They
tie some young tomato plants. An ANT crawls up one of the

SIDO
Agh - ants. There must be honeydew...
COLETTE
(feels the leaf)
Yes.. it’s sticky.
SIDO
The white flies have probably got to it.
They’ll have sucked all the juice.
COLETTE
We need some ladybirds?
SIDO
Or a spider. There’s a big one
that’s dangling in my room. I’ll
catch her and put her to work out

Colette stops, looks at Sido.

COLETTE
Did you ever feel like you were

COLETTE

Sido thinks. Inspects the other leaves.
SIDO
Sometimes as a wife.. Never as a

Colette shakes her head, perturbed.
SIDO (CONT’D)
Is he good to you Gabri..?

What is it, my love?
Colette finally opens up...

Nothing’s how I imagined it.

Willy and Colette walk along the dappled banks of the green
slow river. She is distant. He is persistent.
WILLY
Are you happy to be here?
COLETTE
Yes. It makes the city seem even
more foul...
WILLY
Well, you are a country girl...
She rolls her eyes.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Did you miss me?
COLETTE
(lies)
No, not really.
WILLY
Life has been...awful without you.
Just dead.
His tone grows more emotional. She holds firm.
WILLY (CONT’D)
I don’t feel like myself at all.
Everything seems...utterly
pointless. I can’t even write

You mean more to me than all the
women of Paris put together.

You know me too well.

I can read you like the top line
of an optician's chart.
WILLY
That’s wonderful. Did you make it up?
(she shakes her head exasperated)
Just...tell me what you want,
Gabrielle. And I’ll do it.
She turns faces him.
COLETTE
I know who you are, Willy... And
maybe I knew all along. But I want
you not to lie to me.
WILLY
I won’t. Never again! I promise.
COLETTE
I don’t want to be treated like a
little wife at home. I want to
know what’s going on. Whatever it
may be. I want to be... part of
things.
WILLY
You will be. You will be part of
everything.
He gives her his most sincere eyes. He puts his arms round
her and their voices get quieter as they walk further away.

I’m being serious.

Willy is now in bed, Colette is undressing. They talk
quietly so as not to wake Sido.
COLETTE
Sometimes she could be sweet.. but
she could also be very annoying.
WILLY
In what way?
COLETTE
Well, she was clumsy, more than
anything. One day in winter, when
the first snows started, I made a
compact little snowball and
smuggled it into the classroom. As
Miss Terrain was writing I passed
it along to the next person..
She strips down to her underclothes, shivers slightly.
Brrrrrr.

WILLY
Get in. I’m like a pot-bellied
stove.
Colette gets in and clings to him. Willy warms her hands.

Colette comes out of the kitchen eating a peach. A little
BULLDOG comes scampering after her. This is Toby Chien. She
hears an argument and moves stealthily through the apartment
to ascertain its source. Through the door she sees Pierre
Veber (angry) and Schwob (diplomatic) in front of Willy’s
desk.
WILLY
Get out! Both of you! This is harassment!
SCHWOB
Willy, come on. You’re not being
fair.
VEBER
This is the third time I’ve had to
come round and ask you for it!
WILLY
Then stop coming round and bloody
well asking!
VEBER
I am close to being evicted. You
owe me 400 francs. You’d get the
advance from Ollendorff you said!

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

31.

WILLY
And I will - by Friday.
VEBER
You said that last week.
SCHWOB
A factory needs to pay its workers, Willy!
WILLY
Go on strike then! Get some other idiot
to hire you! Leave me alone! Both of you!
I’ll have your money by Friday.
VEBER
You’d better bloody have it!
Veber walks briskly into the living room, nods to Colette,
too angry to speak, and exits. Schwob follows, saying
goodbye.
Willy emerges, forlorn, and starts to get ready to leave.
WILLY
Damn them! They’d never get
published by themselves. I lend them
my name, my reputation... I take all
the risk. And there’s no money. We
simply need more output.
COLETTE
You could get another writer in.
WILLY
And pay them with what? We only have
about 1000 coming in this month - 300
from the Echo, 425 for the next vamp
novel and 250 from the music reviews.
But it doesn’t cover our outgoings.
COLETTE
How can we spend that much?
WILLY
The mortgage, Matilde, restaurants...
COLETTE
You always pick up the bill,
Willy, however many people join
us.
WILLY
It’s expected.

COLETTE
And the casino. And the races...

What do you want me to do? Live
like a monk? Or a peasant?
COLETTE
I’m just saying we could
economize.
Mademoiselle Terrain
always used to say, “Look after
the pennies and..”
Then lightning strikes...
WILLY
You... You!
What?

COLETTE
WILLY
You could write them up. Those stories of
Saint-Sauveur you told me last year. They
could be Willy’s next novel.
COLETTE
My school stories?
WILLY
Yes. There may be something
there...You must start straight
away, my love. Aim for four hours
at a time - the wolves are at the
door!
He goes back to his study.
53

Colette’s mind is racing.

INT. ENTRANCE ROOM – MOMENT’S LATER

Sitting at a desk, exercise book open, Colette dips her
fountain pen in the ink. A statuette of Willy is perched in
the front of the desk, overlooking her. She writes SCHOOL
NOTES BY GABRIELLE-SIDONIE COLETTE on the first page.
Then...

Moments later, a rather tipsy Willy enters the bedroom.
Colette is in bed, her eyes wide open.
WILLY
Why aren’t you sleeping?
COLETTE
I only just stopped writing.
Willy sits on the bed, belches, and takes off his boots.
WILLY
Did you manage four hours...?
COLETTE
Twice that. At least.
WILLY
Really?! You must be a natural!
COLETTE
I’ve changed a few things...for the
story. But it might ruffle a few
feathers back home.
WILLY
Don’t worry about the facts. You can
add a character, make up an event.
Adapt it to the times! All people
really want is the feeling, the
emotion - that great sweep of
narrative.
COLETTE
So I should just write what I want?
WILLY
Yes! No one will ever dispute it - and
if they do... “It is the hand that
holds the pen that writes history.”
Spontaneously, Colette comes over to him, wraps her arms
around him from behind and nibbles on his ear. He doesn’t
respond.
COLETTE
You’re not in the mood?

MUSIC STARTS UP. We see Colette label a new exercise book
SCHOOL NOTES PART 3 before she starts on the fresh page.
COLETTE (V.O.)
“These are the copses, where bushes
spitefully catch your face as you pass.
Those are full of sun and strawberries
and lilies-of-the-valley and...snakes.
I’ve shuddered there with choking terror
at the sight of those dreadful, smooth,
cold bodies gliding in front of my
feet.’
She is completely absorbed.
COLETTE (V.O.)
“I feel so much alone there, my eyes
lost far away amongst the trees, in the
green, mysterious daylight that is at
once deliciously peaceful and a little
unnerving because of the loneliness and
the vague darkness.”

There’s a pile of five notebooks on Willy’s desk with a
ribbon round them and a label that says “For Willy.”
Seated behind his desk, Willy unties the precious package,
picks up the first book and settles in to read it.
After a few pages he takes a cigar and lights it.

Colette is playing with TOBY CHIEN on the floor. She gets
up and looks at the grandfather clock in the hall - 1:30.

congratulatory but awkward.

I?
Yes.

WILLY
Except I love you. I adore you.
Let’s be clear about that.
COLETTE
Just tell me.
He finishes up, zips up, and comes into the bedroom.
WILLY
There’s nothing driving it. No
plot. A novel by Willy... It grips
you from page one. Yours has...
(he gestures)
...too many adjectives. Some of
the characters are interesting but
overall... Well, it’s just too
cloying. Too...feminine.
She says nothing, stares at the floor, anger mounting.
COLETTE
Well that was a waste of nine
months.

Not if you enjoyed it.
Not wanting to break in front of Willy, she storms off,
through the apartment.

A makeshift stage, where the famous mime artist, WAGUE,
performs a lip-sync sketch, accompanied by a PIANIST and a
FEMALE SINGER. The audience is transfixed by his mastery of
the form.
Colette and Schwob are at the edge of the crowd. Colette is
dressed in black and white, her style feels modern and edgy well ahead of the fussily-dressed socialites.
COLETTE
Wague’s mesmerizing, isn’t he?
SCHWOB
Yes - he’s the king of

The song plays out its last few lines. Everyone bursts into

SCHWOB
Oh god no! I do it to prevent me

This registers with Colette. Despite her bravura - she misses
it. They are interrupted by a beautiful couple; GASTON and
JEANNE de CAILLAVET.
GASTON
Hello Schwob! Good to see you.

In a pool of gaslight, Willy and Colette are seated at the
desk. Willy is going through his notes.
WILLY
...example, “it’s a lovely spring
morning,” liven it up. How about:
(grand gesture)
“Perhaps it’s the season. It’s too
fine - almost disgracefully fine.”
She scribbles it down.
WILLY (CONT’D)
And page 29 - that scene with
Luce.
(he finds it)
I’ve added: “she brushes up
against me suggestively, her blue
eyes half closed and her mouth
half-open.”
COLETTE
That’s quite louche.
WILLY
Louche sells, my dear. Trust me all we need is a little more spice,
a little less literature. I know
what men want. And so do the
publishers.
Colette ponders this for a moment - not completely satisfied.
COLETTE
And you really think they’ll take
it?
WILLY
Yes! Ollendorff will go nuts for it.
COLETTE
(ironically)
As you did on first reading.

COLETTE
Look at him. I haven’t seen him as

OLLENDORFF
Well, we’ve never had one fly off
the shelves like this before. Quite
a phenomenon. Everyone’s talking
about it. And you know who’s buying
it? Young women!
WILLY
Really, I thought...that’s interesting.
OLLENDORFF
We’ve also been having enquiries about
theatrical rights. Any thoughts?
WILLY
Of course, the theatre is the next logical
step! With as large a stage as possible!
OLLENDORFF
It’s the theatre-going public
which will make you rich, Willy.
WILLY
Make us all rich, my dear Ollendorff.
They laugh as they leave the room.

Colette is waiting by a carriage outside. She sees Willy

WILLY
So what size are you thinking of..?
OLLENDORFF
Perhaps - 20,000 units or 25,000
somewhere in that ballpark. I’m
waiting to see what the pre-orders
are like back from the sellers.
WILLY
And what kind of return would that
yield?
OLLENDORFF
Well, we’re calculating about 3
francs a unit profit - so, yes it’s a tidy sum.
The men push through the double doors and are now fully
audible.

OLLENDORFF
I believe that Willy based
“Claudine” in part on your school

COLETTE
Yes, I believe I had a little

WILLY
Finally...finally we’ve a success.
And then you imply that I’m not

COLETTE
I didn’t... Most books are “based
on” something.
WILLY
Listen, we’re holding dynamite here.
We have created something very
powerful. But if it goes off at the
wrong time it will blow our bloody
heads off.
COLETTE
It was only Ollendorff. He’s your
publisher, Willy.
WILLY
Schwob also said something.
COLETTE
Schwob’s part of the factory.
WILLY
People love to talk. They’ll praise
you to your face, but as soon as you
turn around...Tch! The knives are in
your back. You don’t know the
mentality here. I do.
COLETTE
I know it well enough to write a
book that’s the toast of Paris.
WILLY
Shout it to the streets then. Tell
people. Roll up for the
massacre...
Colette sighs, Willy really is quite upset. The matter
seems to cut to the core of his identity.
WILLY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. Perhaps I
overreacted... Anyway, I’ve a

And that one?
COLETTE
Chestnut...A weeping Chestnut.
WILLY
I don’t know why you love nature so
much. Animals are vile to each
other.
COLETTE
Animals are honest at least. They
never lie.
WILLY
Well yes, my dear, that is because
they can’t speak.
They come out of the trees into a clearing. There is a
small lawn in front of a neoclassical country home.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Look at that!
COLETTE
Yes, it’s somebody’s house.

Willy and Colette stand at the door. He knocks and rings a

COLETTE
Wait... they might be upstairs.
WILLY
Or deaf... They’ve been deafened
by all the country silence.
COLETTE
Shhh... I thought I heard something.
WILLY
Give me a kiss.
Willy is on good form and charming Colette. She kisses him,
aware too that the door might open.
COLETTE
Someone might come.
Good...

WILLY
He tries the door, it’s locked. Kisses her again.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Put your hand in my pocket.
There’s something there for you.
Willy!

COLETTE
He leads her hand downward. Slightly puzzled, Colette
reaches into Willy’s pocket and retrieves... a key!

They enter the formerly-grand old house - still beautiful

COLETTE
...Whose house is it?
WILLY
For you, my love, my heart. Lest
Paris drive you mad.
What?

COLETTE
WILLY
It’s yours. You’re always talking
about missing the countryside.
Willy kisses the key and gives it to Colette who stares at
him and then again at the house.
COLETTE
Willy, I can’t believe it.
WILLY
Somewhere for you to write. And be alone.
Colette hugs him lovingly, then breaks off.
COLETTE
So...where did you get the money?
WILLY
I got an advance from Ollendorff.
25,000 Francs.
For what?

COLETTE
WILLY
For the next book. “Claudine in

WILLY
Bugger the roses. We have a deadline.
COLETTE
It’s actually harder to write out

WILLY
Are you out of your mind? Claudine
is a franchise! Do you realize how
rare this moment is? When people
are begging for more? Come.
He walks her through the house and up the stairs.
WILLY (CONT’D)
What would the headmaster do if
Claudine had not done her
homework?
COLETTE
Willy. Don’t be silly.
WILLY
(serious)
What would he do?
COLETTE
(sarcastic)
Make her do lines? Put her over

He arrives at the door of the study and stands expectantly
at the door jamb as she walks past him into the study.

She stands back breathing hard. Then turns with a look of
resignation to the writing desk.

She sits for a moment, still smarting from the exchange, dips
her pen in the ink and writes “Claudine in Paris.”

A beautiful day, PARISIANS are promenading and riding
bicycles and velocipedes in the open air. Colette and Willy
are pedaling a tandem. She’s at the front, putting in most of
the leg work, he, true to form, is taking it easy at the
back.
Under the trees, a cafe has been set up with delicate folding
chairs and small round tables. A few dozen SOCIETY TYPES are
enjoying tea and cakes.
Depositing their tandem by a tree. Colette and Willy
approach. There is a feeling that all eyes are on them.
Walking through the tables they go past a beautiful red-headed
heiress, named GEORGIE Raoul Duval. She is taking tea with her
companion, a pretty young girl named LILY.
LILY
(whispering)
Colette and Willy are here!
GEORGIE
So they are. Don’t stare.
Across the patio, Colette and Willy are seated by a WAITER.
Georgie takes out a small card and scribbles a note.
GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Go take this to them.
MOMENTS LATER
Post-exercise the couple are eating cake.
COLETTE
Mmmm. It’s good.
Indeed.

He looks round.
WILLY (CONT’D)

are reading Claudine in Paris right now?
COLETTE
I don’t know.

WILLY
At least three quarters, I’d say.
And those who haven’t yet will soon
catch up.
He notices Lily weaving through the tables towards them.
WILLY (CONT’D)
(to himself)
What comes this way?
LILY
M. Willy, Mme. Colette, I have a note
for you....from Mrs. Raoul Duval.
Clearly a little starstruck, she hands Willy the note and he
surveys it.
WILLY
(remembering)
Mrs. Raoul Duval.
Yes.

Georgie Raoul Duval?

LILY

WILLY
Oh... wonderful!.. Please go tell
your mistress we accept her
invitation and look forward to her
delightful company.
LILY
(thrilled)
I will!
And off she goes.
COLETTE
Who is she?
WILLY
(under his breath)
...An American - a wayward
debutante from Louisiana.. she
married a munitions magnate three
times her age.

They sound a bit dull.

INT. CAFE NOIR - EVENING

In the high ceilinged cafe, we follow a WAITER who drops a
bill off at a table where Georgie and Colette are in fits of
hysterics - the kind of laughter sustained by the seriously
drunk and flirtatious. Willy is providing the after-dinner
entertainment. Lily sits by them, awed at getting to spend
time with such celebrities, autograph book at the ready.
GEORGIE
(almost crying with
laughter)
That’s so funny. Did he really say that?
COLETTE
Oh yes - he would. He is such a
colossal snob.
WILLY
Then Mme de Caillavet happened to
mention that he was only a baron
and not a Marquise. “Allow me, he
said “I am also Duke of Anjou,
Bishop of Coutances, Prince of
Joinville, of Asturias, of Orléans
and the Dunes. But all that isn't
of the slightest importance...
(with perfect timing)
...here.”
Everyone howls with laughter. A stray curl of her hair
falls down over Georgie’s face.
COLETTE
Wait a moment.
Colette takes the lock and tries to pat it back into place.
A moment of electricity passes between the two. Willy
watches fascinated.
COLETTE (CONT’D)
Hold still. That’s it.
She takes her hands away. The disobedient lock immediately
falls back down. The women lose it.
The waiter comes back by the table.
WILLY
(paying the bill)
Here you are.

book forward)

Of course! My pleasure. I’ll even
do you a doodle. Of me.

Oh thank you!
He hands it back. Georgie looks impatient.
LILY (CONT’D)
And yours too Madame Colette.
GEORGIE
Oh come now...
COLETTE
Not at all. Spirit should always
be rewarded.
She returns the book to Lily who positively vibrates with
excitement.
WILLY
Good night, my dear.

She hurries off.

GEORGIE
Well... I live at 74 Rue Goethe. If you’d
like to stop by for at nightcap...

Thank you so much. But I feel like I
will retire this evening.
GEORGIE
Are you sure now?
Willy...

COLETTE

WILLY
We’ll play again soon, my dear.
GEORGIE
Yes...I hope so. Before my bore of
a husband returns. Well adieu!
And she’s gone. Willy weighs this.
COLETTE
You don’t want to go?
WILLY
The invitation was clearly for
you.
This really lands for Colette.
COLETTE
... Should I?
WILLY
Yes, of course.
COLETTE
You don’t mind?
WILLY
I’d be a hypocrite if I did,
wouldn’t I?
Colette considers this.

When I was a girl, I was told all
the lakes in Louisiana have
alligators. So I never went for a

Georgie looks down then raises her eyes towards Colette.

When you raise your eyelids, it’s as
if you were taking off all my clothes.
Georgie looks down, blushing.

were waiting for you, my dear.”
COLETTE
I don’t think she would believe him.
WILLY
Of course not.
This is a sore point.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
WILLY (CONT’D)
But don’t you think she’s being
hypocritical - I mean, it’s acceptable
for Claudine to sleep with Rezi but
she doesn’t want Renaud to do the
same?
COLETTE
Not behind her back, no. The betrayal
came when Renaud lied to her. Renaud
who swore he would always be honest.
WILLY
Perhaps he wanted to tell her, but he
was frightened of her terrible
jealousy?
COLETTE
Then he was a coward as well as a
liar.
WILLY
You’re very harsh on him.
COLETTE
Who else will be? And Renaud would
never be jealous? If for instance,
Claudine went off with.. A young
man, for a change?
WILLY
He would find that unacceptable.
COLETTE
Infidelity, for Renaud is a matter
of gender.
WILLY
It is...
(clears his throat)
How long have you known..?
COLETTE
For a month or so.
Colette has won this one. Willy clears his throat.
WILLY
Well I must say, I’m impressed with the
way you’ve handled yourself. The
younger Claudine would have thrown a
fit.

COLETTE
I’m planning on killing Renaud off

WILLY
No - you can’t. Please.
COLETTE
(quoting Willy)
“The hand that holds the pen writes
history.”
Willy shoots her an amused but slightly threatened look.
WILLY
Renaud’s moral shadings aside, the
writing is very good. Quite a work
of art. Those little scratches you
make on the paper (he indicates)
- very powerful. And it will have a
powerful effect. Everyone will immediately
know whom it’s about, there will be a huge
scandal, the books will spread like
thistledown all over France.
COLETTE
And M. Willy will have yet another
hot book on his hands.
An uneasy truce has been declared.
WILLY (cont’d)
You know what? I’m tempted to go
back and put even more Georgie into
Rezi.
COLETTE
Willy, we have to draw the line
somewhere.
WILLY
Why, my dear? Our marriage is
already public domain.

COLETTE
GEORGIE
I’ve put him off. Hopefully it
won’t come to that.

You’ve read it, yes?
I have.

COLETTE
GEORGIE
How worried should I be?
Georgie walks across to her with the drink.
COLETTE
The names have all been changed.
It’s not blatantly obvious who is
who...
GEORGIE
I don’t believe you. Everyone is
chattering about it - saying it
will be salacious in the extreme.
(She clears her throat)
I know you have no time for me since our
separation and I know I behaved badly.
But I’m begging you... Ask Willy to
change it - before publication?
Colette slowly shakes her head.
GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Please Colette... One woman to
another? Please...
COLETTE
No, I can’t.
GEORGIE
You’d let me suffer?

GEORGIE
You had your chance to be decent. So,
it will be left to my husband to settle
it.
Ollendorff has agreed to a lump sum for
the destruction of the entire print

COLETTE
What? You can’t do that.
GEORGIE
He has already accepted.
COLETTE

COLETTE
I said it would be a “hot book.”
WILLY
The thing is though, Ollendorff signed
the deal but unfortunately failed to
mention...
(drum rolls the table...)
That he didn’t own the copyright. I
do.
SCHWOB
Unbelievable!
WILLY
All I had to do was trot round to
another publisher and collect a second
advance. The presses are hard at it as
we speak.
SCHWOB
How do you two do it?
COLETTE
I think we got very lucky...
WILLY
Not at all! That American tart
and her senile lackey didn’t stand
a chance. We are with the times!
The wind is under our wings! And I
have a little plan that will make
Claudine the most popular girl in
France, if not the entire world.

INT. THEATRE – DAY - 1903

On a blackboard, in chalk is written “CLAUDINE AUDITIONS.”
An insipid actress is cooing her way though the dialogue.
INSIPID ACTRESS
My name is Claudine. I live in
Montigny. I was born there in
1881. I shall probably not die
there...
Colette and Willy are sitting in the tenth row of the theatre.
In front of them are the DIRECTOR and two FINANCIERS.
Colette, now in her late twenties, seems to have grown
comfortable in her skin. Willy, on the other hand, is showing
the tell-tale signs of a life too-well lived.
WILLY
She’s not bad.
COLETTE
She’s terrible.
INSIPID ACTRESS
Montigny is a village, not a town:
its streets, thank heaven, are not
paved; the showers roll down them
in little torrents that dry up in
a couple hours; it is a village,
not even a very pretty village,
but, all the same, I adore it.
WILLY
(to Colette)
Yes, you’re right.
(shouts)
Thank you very much. Next.
A SECOND ACTRESS comes up on stage and starts repeating the
line. Colette notices the impressive hourglass silhouette
of a woman in the rear doorway.
The woman marches down the aisle and plants herself in
front of them. Wearing a schoolgirl smock, she is vibrant,
Algerian, with bobbed hair and a tiny waist. This is
POLAIRE.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

POLAIRE
M. Willy. I am the real Claudine!
Colette and Willy exchange an intrigued look.

Colette and Willy sit, examining photographs of Polaire.
WILLY
Polaire! Polaire! Daughter of the
desert. Look at her! Look at her! She
knows the role instinctively.
COLETTE
She talks about the book as though
it were a religion.
WILLY
A “Sister of Perpetual Claudine.”
COLETTE
It’s interesting. She’s started to copy
little gestures and mannerisms that I do.
Yes...

WILLY
COLETTE
Do you think I could act?
WILLY
You? No. It would be a criminal waste.
COLETTE
Waste of what?
Willy shrugs, dismissing the thought. He picks up a photo
and examines it closer.
WILLY (cont’d)
That bobbed hair... I’ve never seen
anything like it. Have you?
COLETTE
(suspicious)
I always imagined Claudine had
long hair.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
That was the 19th Century
Claudine...this is now.
He holds the picture up beside her.
WILLY (CONT’D)
Would look good on you, actually. Very
fetching.
COLETTE
No. Willy, I couldn’t.
WILLY
It would make you look younger.
Really?

COLETTE

WILLY
You’re turning thirty soon - what
better time to turn the clocks...
COLETTE
Thank you... But I’ve always had my
hair... Sido would kill me.
WILLY
Just think of it... You and Polaire
- The Claudine Twins!
What!?

WILLY
It’ll be a goldmine of publicity.
All Paris will be atwitter.

WILLY
My word! Where have you gone?
COLETTE
Willy, I hate it.
Willy circles his strange new wife.
WILLY
No... I like it very much.
COLETTE
It’s absurd. My head looks too big
for my body.
WILLY
It’ll just take a bit of getting
used to...
Colette goes to a mirror.
COLETTE
Oh – what did I do?
Colette covers her face with her hands. She starts to
hyperventilate, holding back sobs.
COLETTE (CONT’D)
She butchered me. I look ten years
older. You made me do this.
WILLY
Oh come now, you went along with it...
you always do.
Unexpectedly, she flies at him. He holds her arms away from
his chest. As they struggle COLETTE
You bastard! Look at me...and all
for your damned publicity?
WILLY
Gabrielle!
COLETTE
You crowd-pleaser! You cheap
bastard!! You shit!
She starts beating on his chest. And keeps going... until
she is exhausted and breaks into tears.

Starting on the back of Colette’s head, now looking superchic with the new haircut, we follow Colette and Willy as
they take their seats in a private box for the opening
night of "Claudine." Next to them are SALONITE and her
husband.
SALONITE
Colette, you look ravishing.
She smiles.
The house lights dim, the ORCHESTRA strikes up and the
curtain goes up. Polaire makes an exuberant entrance.
POLAIRE
My name is Claudine. I live in Montigny...
Colette’s eyes shine as her heroine becomes flesh.

Now that you are such a celebrity,

Willy continues to hold forth.
Someone who appears to be a dapper gentleman dressed as
Napoleon approaches Colette. This, we will find out
momentarily, is a woman called MISSY.
SCHWOB
Can you believe this crowd?
Everyone’s here! Look there’s the
Marquise de Belbeuf... or Missy, as
she’s known.
A woman?

COLETTE
SCHWOB
Descended from Empress Josephine
on one side, the Tsar of Russia on
the other - She only shows up for
very special occasions.
COLETTE
Fascinating.
The moment is interrupted by a hubbub. Colette looks around
the corner where Polaire is making her entrance carried
aloft on a litter by FOUR MUSCULAR GUYS. She is showered
with praise and flowers.
WILLY
Polaire! Over here!
POLAIRE
Monsieur Willy!
She is deposited before...

MISSY
I know... It’s a man’s world.
They exchange a look. Ahead of them is a more populated
thoroughfare. They hover for a moment, in the shade of the
last tree, cherishing their improvised privacy. Colette
kisses her fingers and places them on Missy’s lips as a
carriage goes rattling past.

Colette is composing a note at her small writing desk.
COLETTE (V.O.)
I hope the path we walked today was
merely the beginning... I see your
face, Missy.. strong, vulnerable.
I've never met anyone like you polite yet direct, reserved yet
brave - a true gentle man. I will
think of you, if I may, as my
chevalier.
She smiles to herself as she writes - Missy has really gotten
to her.

A very early automobile is putt-putting down the road.
Willy is driving, with Meg seated by his side. In the back,
Colette sits next to Missy.

WILLY
Meg’s a sweet thing, isn’t she?
She can be a little overeager, but
there we are...she reminds me of
you - ten years ago.
COLETTE
Nothing like. But she is very sweet.
WILLY
We do have a very modern marriage,
don’t we?
COLETTE
We do... What do you think of Missy?
WILLY
She’s very pleasant. But she
perplexes me. Words in our language
are either masculine or feminine.
There’s no word for Missy.
COLETTE
(smiling)
Oh, I know one...
WILLY
You seem content, for once. Isn’t
there something missing?
COLETTE
What do you mean?

Colette and Missy run up the stairs laughing, wild with

Missy puts her hand down Colette’s skirts and starts to
pleasure her. It’s a new level of erotic engagement for
Colette.

Next door, a different kind of scene. Willy is waiting

She shuffles out in a full Claudine smock and stands
simpering at the foot of the bed.
MEG
My name is Claudine. I live in
Montigny. I was born there
in...(she calculates)
Should I change the year?
WILLY
No. Keep it the same.

I was born in 1881...
WILLY
That’s right.
MEG
I will probably not die there.

Sunshine and bird song. By the weatherworn gym equipment,
Missy holds Colette’s feet as she does sit ups on the
horse.
MISSY
48...49...50. Well done...
Colette finishes breathing heavily.
COLETTE
Missy, you were married once,
weren’t you?
MISSY
Yes, it was awful... We don’t talk
anymore, except through the auspices
of lawyers. He’s embarrassed by me if he was married to me, what does
that say about him?
COLETTE
It must have been very hard for you,
I mean, to put on the trousers..?
MISSY
No, it was entirely natural. I was a
rather awkward child - if you can
imagine me in pigtails and a dress. I
never felt like I belonged. Then one
day I tried on my brother’s school
uniform.
(MORE)

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
MISSY (CONT'D)
And I knew I was home for the first
time... Of course, it’s far easier
for me than for women of no means...
but I wanted to show that it can be
done. I do imagine a time when all
women may wear trousers if that is
their wish.
Colette smiles, reflecting.
And you?

MISSY (CONT’D)
COLETTE
What about me?
MISSY
Well, I dress as a man; Willy
dresses you as a schoolgirl.
COLETTE
(ironically)
Thank you.
(takes a breath)
I do know what I’m doing, you know.
I’m in on the joke.
MISSY
I don’t doubt it. But are you
happy?
COLETTE
Is anybody happy? Willy’s demanding yes, but he gives me a lot of freedom.
MISSY
It’s a long leash he keeps you on
but a leash nevertheless...
perhaps you enjoy that.
COLETTE
Do you think that’s terribly
wrong?
MISSY
No. That’s entirely your business. But...
never mind.
What?

Willy is pawing over an account ledger as she enters.
COLETTE
Morning Willy.
WILLY
My word. What are you wearing?
COLETTE
They’re Missy’s.
WILLY
My Dear, I’m surprised you didn’t
get arrested. Or beaten up.
Colette shrugs this off.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
COLETTE
Willy...I’ve was thinking. You know
‘Claudine Takes Off’ - why don’t we
publish it under both our names?
WILLY
Out of the question. Ollendorff
will never agree.
COLETTE
Ollendorff or you?
WILLY
My dear, do you want to the kill the goose
that’s laying the golden Claudines?
Colette is exasperated.
COLETTE
But there’s little risk. Claudine’s
established... And many people, they
know already... or suspect ...Surely.
WILLY
No one knows. Unless you’ve been crowing
about it to your lady man friend.
COLETTE
Don’t insult Missy.
WILLY
I think she is stripping you of your
sense of humour...and your common sense.
COLETTE
That’s not fair Willy.
WILLY
We can’t risk it. Especially not with
our present finances. We’re dead broke.
COLETTE
We’re always broke! Yet you gamble and
fill this place with all your antiques.

They were bought from bankrupts at

WILLY
...And you? Your clothes, your hats,

COLETTE
(adamant)
I want my name on the book.
WILLY
No no no. Willy is a brand name. And
the fact is, women writers don’t sell.
Colette lets out a gasp of frustration.
COLETTE
Bastard! Selfish, smug, fat, lazy bastard!
WILLY
I’ll give you fat... All the other
descriptions are libel.
COLETTE
I need credit for my work! My name on
it!
WILLY
Utter nonsense! If you were so
concerned about that you never should
have agreed to it all.

Without the progenitor, there

Colette takes his pile of papers and throws them on the
floor and marches out.

EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

The atmosphere is thick, humid, charged with electricity.
Colette walks through the gloomy streets, lost in her own
thoughts. She feels small, disinherited, angry.
She walks towards the Seine and looks out over the water.
Down by the quayside a YOUNG CLAUDINE is with her
SWEETHEART, flirting and kissing. Colette looks
despondently at something she created but cannot own.

The ivories of a piano are being hammered. A BOHEMIAN
PIANIST is playing a rhythmic Oriental piece.
Light bounces around the studio, with its polished floors
and huge mirrors. Four YOUNG DANCERS in leotards crawl on
all fours. WAGUE, the renowned mime, is teaching a class.
The door opens. Colette enters. Watches the class in
action. Wague notices her presence, nods curtly, and
continues. Colette starts to take off her outer clothes,
she wears a leotard underneath.
HALF AN HOUR LATER The dancers gather their things. Colette
enters now changed into a leotard with her clothes in a

with a sheet of chiffon draped around her, practicing
movement. Matilde is on her knees cleaning the hearth.
WILLY
Are you going to write today?
No.

COLETTE
I’m rehearsing with Wague later.

WILLY
Don’t you think you ought to?
What are your priorities?
(he looks at her,
frustrated)
I should start locking you up again.
COLETTE
I would scream the house down.
She carries on with the exercises, self-absorbed.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
It’s a charming hobby, Tetette
but... You are not Sarah
Bernhardt. And if you can’t pull
it off as high art you’ll be doing
the bloody music halls, for god’s
sake. And that would be
scandalous.
COLETTE
And when have you ever considered
scandal a bad thing?
WILLY
True...What does Missy say?
COLETTE
He’s all for it. He comes along to
Wague’s studio with me all the time.
WILLY
How depressing. Does she have no
life of her own whatsoever?
COLETTE
Missy does the movements with me.
He’s rather good.
Willy nods - he’s having one of his famous ‘big ideas.’
COLETTE (CONT’D)
Wague thinks I could be a ready
for the stage in a few weeks. What
do you think, Matilde?
MATILDE
I have to agree with M. Willy,
Ma’am. It’s not very lady-like.
COLETTE
I thought you were on my side!
MATILDE
Suit yourself.
WILLY
So you and the Marquise run around the
studio as potty mimetic lovers do you?
(Colette nods)
And Missy shares your ambition to
go on the stage?
COLETTE
Oh no, he’s far too shy.

Willy is pitching a THEATRE MANAGER after a heavy lunch.
WILLY
It’ll be called “The Dream of Egypt.”
Paris will never have seen anything
like it. A scandalous sensation starring Madame Colette Willy and...
(drumroll on the table)
The Marquise de Belbeuf!!! In the
common or garden music hall! Can you
imagine? It’ll be a full house. Every
night.
THEATRE MANAGER
We do perfectly well with the can-can.
WILLY
I’ve seen it half empty on a week night.
THEATRE MANAGER
You can vouch for the Marquise?
WILLY
It’s in the bag. We can even put the
Belbeuf family crest on the poster.
The press will go wild. You mark my
words.
THEATRE MANAGER
Do you have backers?
WILLY
I only need one. Myself.
THEATRE MANAGER
You’re that confident? That’s a lot of
capital.
Willy bluffs somewhat - in his eyes, a slight worry.
WILLY
Yes... Yes I am.

The place is filling up - Rachilde, Veber, Schwob, Madame
de Caillavet with Gaston and Jeanne and many SALONITES. On
stage, stands a large, solitary sarcophagus.
Willy, accompanied by Meg, makes his way to a table near
the stage, greeting various folk.
MEG
My God, there’s Maurice Ravel - and
there’s Madame de Caillavet...all of our
friends are here.

Yes, a lot of the Marquis’ friends
are here too.
He indicates a block-booking of starchy-looking aristocrats
near the front.
154

INT. MOULIN ROUGE - HALF AN HOUR LATER

The house lights come down, precipitating a wave of wolf
whistles and cat calls. Up on a balcony, a man dressed as
ANUBIS strikes a gong. A SMALL ORCHESTRA strikes up a moody
Arabian theme.
WILLY
Here we go.
The curtain goes up on a set resembling the interior of an
Egyptian tomb – hieroglyphics, statues etc.
Missy enters the stage woodenly, dressed as an
archeologist, reading from an old book. The crowd ROARS. A
shower of coins, orange peel and garlic cloves rains on the
stage.
Undaunted, Missy finds a cartouche on the sarcophagus and
carefully brushes the dust off it.
HECKLER
Get a move on, you dyke!
Then, with great effort, Missy opens the lid of the
sarcophagus. The lights change. The orchestra ramps up.
And something starts to appear.
In the crowd various people react: Mme. de Caillavet,
sneering TOP-HATTED GENTLEMEN, Veber, Schwob, Gaston de
Caillavet. Willy watches intently, picking up on every murmur
of the crowd.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

Emerging from the sarcophagus is Colette, cross-legged in a
bejeweled outfit inspired by Salome. The audience gasps.
Rhythmic music kicks in and Colette starts to do a series
of evocative movements. Missy watches her in stagy wonder.
Some audience members are delighted, others appalled.
A POSH HECKLER
Degenerate! Get back to Lesbos!
Now the dance is really heating up. Colette comes down from
the pedestal and starts to dance. Missy joins in, framing
Colette’s gyrations with her own eccentric movements.
As the crowd starts to boil over, Willy’s eyes are shining.
At the climax of the dance, Colette falls into the
Marquise’s arms. Their lips move closer and closer – a huge
GASP comes up from the house. Then...
THEY KISS.
The house EXPLODES. People are on their feet, yelling and
booing. A barrage of food and glasses are thrown onto the
stage, smashing around the embracing couple - even a
footstool, which Colette narrowly dodges. The curtain
falls.
WILLY
(to Meg)
It may be time to go...
But the rioting audience turn on them.
ANOTHER HECKLER
Cuckold! Cuckold!!
A crowd of RUFFIANS advance on Willy and Meg. Willy brandishes
his cane, keeping them off as he and Meg make their way to the
door. Somebody grabs Meg’s hair and she punches him in the
face. The whole auditorium is in a state of revolt.

My ‘impressions?’ I’m disgusted.
These people who threw things are
cowards - if I didn’t get a

There were some gentleman there
who came for a fight. We just have

He’s dead. You’re alive. Willy’s a

Don’t say that.
She glances out to see Willy in the garden.

He’ll hold you back.

Wague, playing Colette’s husband, discovers them and has a
fit of jealous rage; he shoves Colette around, smashing
dishes and goes to attack the lover.
Colette pleads and tries to explain (silently, of course),
but Wague’s rage just builds. He goes to attack the lover
but Colette gets in between them.
Wague grabs her collar and TEARS IT ASUNDER REVEALING HER
BREAST. Shocked he prostrates himself on the stage as though

I just want you to be able to
write if you want to.
COLETTE
I don’t want to. I’m happy. And I
like my threadbare lodgings...I
like making my own money. Even if
it’s only 50 francs a show.

Missy nods, hiding her hurt.
MISSY
I love you. That’s all.
COLETTE
...Thank you.
MISSY
It’s not the traditional reply but
I’ll take it for now.
They stare into each other’s eyes. There’s a pounding on the
door.
MANAGER
Get up. Now! We’re coming in.
Colette stands using a blanket to cover herself as the
MANAGER opens the door with his WIFE in tow.
MANAGER (CONT’D)
Out! Both of you! Get out of here!
MANAGER’S WIFE
You see? I told you!
COLETTE
What the hell?
MANAGER
You degenerates!
MANAGER’S WIFE
We don’t have filth under our
roof.
MANAGER
You’ve got five minutes to get out
or I’m calling the police.
MISSY
Please fuck off.
(alternate take)
Oh bugger off.
He slams the door.

Colette looks distraught.

COLETTE
What are we going to do now? I have
to be up at six to catch the train
to Nice.

Don’t worry, my dear. We’ll find

Colette looks into Missy’s eyes and finds strength there.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

175

The house has taken on a depressing air - pictures have
been taken down, furniture has been moved out. Colette is
packaging up her collection of paperweights.
Across the room, Willy is packing up some bric-a-brac.
They work in silence, at opposite ends of a wide frame.
WILLY
I’ve been thinking about this new craze
for moving pictures. Do you think we
could adapt Claudine for a cineplay..?
COLETTE
(half to herself)
Do you never stop?
WILLY
We could write a completely fresh
story. Claudine by the Sea.
COLETTE
No... Adapt the old ones...
WILLY
Perhaps...
There’s a flash of guilt in Willy’s eyes.
Catch!

COLETTE

She throws the original Paris snow globe across to him. Half
the water has leaked out and it looks pretty deteriorated.
WILLY
Oh yes! How sad.
Tears come to his eyes but she doesn’t see.
WILLY (CONT’D)
I’ve missed you.
COLETTE
No, you haven’t.
WILLY
Of course I have... your ambiguous
smiles, the insane speed of your
thoughts, your absurd joys, your
brief but violent anger...
Colette is affected by this but won’t let it show. She
finishes up a crate and puts the lid on.
COLETTE
How’s the book going with Meg..?
WILLY
Terrible! All spice and no literature.
(Colette snorts a laugh)
She’s not you and she never will be.
Colette sighs. The tug of old forces on her heart.
COLETTE
What are we doing, Willy?
They look across to each other but the distance between
them seems now unbreachable.
WILLY
...Are we finished?
COLETTE
I don’t know.
Willy sighs, wants to cry. He shrugs.
WILLY
You can’t.
COLETTE
Why can’t I?

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

111.

WILLY
Because I love you and you at your
most brilliant with me.
Am I?

COLETTE
WILLY
Yes, you know you are. But you still
need your headmaster...
176

INT. COLETTE’S BEDROOM - COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
Colette lies awake, troubled. There’s a light knock.
Come in.

COLETTE
Willy enters, dressed in his nightshirt.
WILLY
May I get in with you, Gabri?
COLETTE
- Yes. Get in.
WILLY
I couldn’t sleep. It was too
quiet.
(a quiet moment)
Listen. The silence. It’s
terrifying isn’t it?
COLETTE
No...I love it.
WILLY
Of course, you do - you country girl.
He kisses her on the cheek.
WILLY (CONT’D)
I have something weighing on me...
What..?

COLETTE

WILLY
I...I don’t sleep with Meg any more.
I mean we sleep. But I can’t...
Willy cannot say it.

It does. It matters very much.
She holds him close, as if he were a child.

Good-night, my love.

The audience are applauding. Up on stage Colette and her
music hall troupe bow together holding hands.
178

INT. THEATRE - BACKSTAGE

178

The troupe descend a spiral staircase leading down from the
stage. Colette is next to Wague, exhausted after her
performance. Flossy turns round out.
FLOSSY
Went well tonight!
Colette waves her hand indicating so-so. She turns to go up
some steps when a voice calls out for her.
OLLENDORFF
Madame Willy.
COLETTE
Monsieur Ollendorff!
They shake hands.
OLLENDORFF
I'm here in Lille on some family
business, and I was delighted when I
found out you were here with the play.
COLETTE
It’s kind of you to come and see it.
OLLENDORFF
It was quite a spectacle.
Colette gives him a tight-lipped smile. Two SHOWGIRLS come
down the stairs and bustle past them up.
OLLENDORFF (cont’d) (CONT’D)
I was thinking, if you were free,
I would like to take you and the
Marquise to dinner.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

113.

COLETTE
Thank you. I’m always up for a free
feed. And especially in such august
company.
OLLENDORFF
It’s the very least I can do for you,
Colette. After all the money you’ve
made for me. And will continue to make.
(he gives a tight-lipped smile)
I wish I had been able to give Willy
a better settlement. But one can
only pay what one can afford.
COLETTE
I’m not sure I quite understand.
OLLENDORFF
For the Claudines. For the rights
to the Claudines.
A STAGEHAND passes between them carrying a bunch of flowers
up the stairs.
OLLENDORFF (CONT’D)
Do you mean to say he didn’t tell you?
Colette looks at him stunned.
COLETTE
Willy sold you the Claudines?
OLLENDORFF
Yes. All of them.
COLETTE
He sold you Claudines...
OLLENDORFF
Absolutely. I’m sorry. I
thought..?
Colette struggles to keep herself under control.
COLETTE
How much did he get for her?

Paul Héon sit typing while Willy stands, giving dictation.
Colette is at the door, livid.
WILLY
...I am most insulted by the
implication of your letter. We
have transacted business now for
over five years without any...
Colette storms in.
COLETTE
Willy, I need to see you alone.
WILLY
Tetette! What a wonderful
surprise!
Sensing the impending storm, Héon rises, makes for the
door.
HEON
I’ll see you later, Willy,
Colette.
He leaves the two of them alone.
So?

WILLY
She just looks at him.
COLETTE
5000 francs, Willy. 5000 francs...
WILLY
Ah... You’ve heard... Yes...
Well...I was in a corner.
COLETTE
Traitor. Liar. Thief.
WILLY
Don’t be so melodramatic. I was
trying to keep the house for you.
COLETTE
I gave you the house!
WILLY
We still owed the bank so much on
it.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

115.

COLETTE
You could have sold Veber’s
novels. Some of your other trash.
You only did it to stick the knife
in me. Didn’t you?! DIDN’T YOU?!
WILLY
I wouldn’t have got anything for
Veber’s or Schwob’s or anyone
else’s. Please calm down...
COLETTE
Why? Why should I calm down? You hurt
and you hurt and you think that by
saying “I’m a man, that’s what men
do,” you clear it all away...
He reaches for her hand. She explodes, recoils as if at an
electric shock.
COLETTE (CONT’D)
DON’T YOU TOUCH ME! What you did was
not just hateful - it was stupid. Now
we’ll have no say over our books and
we’ll never see another sou from them.
WILLY
We can write some more...
COLETTE
No! Never again! NEVER!
WILLY
My dear, you’re over-reacting. It
was purely a business decision.
COLETTE
That’s what our whole marriage has
been! Wasn’t I the best investment
you ever made? No dowry but my
God, she can write for her keep?
WILLY
If you were an investment then you
were a highly speculative one. I
gave up my inheritance for you.
COLETTE
I paid you back a thousand times.
WILLY
Colette stop, damn it!! Stop
talking about money. You were my
ideal, my obsession, my love.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

116.

Colette catches her breath and slowly turns to him. Her
eyes are burning. When she speaks, it is with unexpected
calm.
COLETTE
You’ve killed our child.
Willy stares at her, stunned.
COLETTE (CONT’D)
Those books – they were all we
had. Now they’re gone and we’ve no
chance of repair.
WILLY
My dear, Claudine was only a...
COLETTE
Don’t! Don’t tell me what Claudine
was. I am the real Claudine!!!
(he tries to interrupt)
Everything I thought and felt went
into those books. They were me. My
childhood, my memories, my opinions.
Everything. And then the hours and
hours I spent, alone, slaving away for
you. Churning out scenes just to try
and please you. I am so ashamed of
myself for that. But I knew and you
knew - that I was bound to do it.
(she shakes her head)
You found me when I knew nothing,
Willy. You molded me to your own
designs...to your desires. And you
thought I could never break free...
But you’re wrong. Claudine is dead
now. She’s gone. You betrayed her. And
I...I’ve outgrown her.
Willy sinks into a chair. He looks exhausted, deflated. He
has finally broken.
WILLY
Please, my dear, I was stupid... I
panicked... forgive me. Please.
COLETTE
Goodbye, Willy.
She walks to the door.

Willy’s tone turns.

WILLY
No...Tetette...Gabrielle....My
love...Stop! I forbid you..!

INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

183

Willy is looking through the exercise books. Page after page
of Colette school notebooks, - the original text of the
Claudine novels with the occasional margin note from Willy.
He is thinking out loud to Heon...
WILLY
You see - that’s mine, that’s mine it was a collaboration... she really
has a nerve... These prove it.
Heon says nothing. Willy reads his silence.
WILLY (CONT’D)
You know... Could you do me a favor,
Héon? Could you destroy these for me?
HEON
Are you sure?
WILLY
Definitely. Burn them. Incinerate.
HEON
Yes, Willy.
WILLY
Thank you.
(sighs)
I’m going out.
He heads out the door. Leaving Héon with the books.

INT. CAFE NOIR – MORNING
Willy and Schwob sitting at a dark table nursing an
absinthe. A chess set is in front of them but they are
barely interested in the game.
SCHWOB
...How many decent salons are left
now? Two, maybe three.
WILLY
It’s the end of a dream.

SCHWOB
Paris is losing its gold.
WILLY
Yes, I must confess, I don’t think
that this century agrees with me
quite as much as the last one.
SCHWOB
I haven’t heard from Colette. I’ve
written to her twice but no word.
WILLY
Writing is anathema to her, it
always has been.
SCHWOB
You two really are done this time?
WILLY
She’ll pass me on the street and
not even look at me. “Claudine
Divorced.” So much the worse for
her. And for me...
A solemn silence. Across the bar a YOUNG WOMAN (who we
remember as LILY - GEORGIE’S ASSISTANT) and her GIRLFRIEND
are having coffee at the bar. She says something to her
then ventures across the room.
M. Willy?

LILY

WILLY
I am the late Monsieur Willy.
LILY
I’m Lily - Lily Milson. I met you once.
Years ago. I used to work for Madame
Raoul Duval.
WILLY
Oh yes! I saw you and your friend
come in and I thought - what
wonderful young creatures! Thank
heaven for... you, my dear
This embarrasses Lily.
LILY
I just wanted to say hello.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
Well, how about you two come and
share a drink with a couple of old
roués?
He gives her a come on look through bleary eyes. Schwob looks
embarrassed.
WILLY (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
It’s never too early...
He pats the seat beside him. Lily looks disillusioned, sad.
LILY
(nervously)
I’m sorry, I have to go... Very
nice seeing you.
And she’s gone.

Willy stares sadly into his drink.

SCHWOB
Loosing your touch...
WILLY
Lost! The Claudines are done with
their headmaster.
He downs the last dregs and sighs.

Héon stokes up the fire in Willy’s study. He takes the first
book and is about to throw in on. Then he stops, opens the
book and looks at the words for a moment.
Taking a decision, he puts all the books in a leather
satchel, and heads out the door.

INT. DRESSING ROOM – EVENING

189

At the venue, Colette is getting dressed. She pulls on a
stocking but her big toe pokes through it. It’s torn.
Shit!

COLETTE
She goes over to a large trunk in the corner, opens it up,
and rifles around in the tattered sequin gowns. At the
bottom of the trunk, she finds something that stops her in
her tracks. It is one of her school notebooks - the last
one of the original Claudine At School manuscript. She flips
through it and about a third of the way in finds the page
that says THE END.
Wague sticks his head in the door.
WAGUE
Thirty minutes to curtain.
COLETTE
Thanks, Wague.
She blows him a kiss.
190

MOMENTS LATER

190

The nib of a pen is dipped in ink. On the opposite page from
the end of Claudine, Colette writes “NOTES ON THE MUSIC HALL.”
She starts to write again - we hear a new authority in her
voice.
COLETTE (V.O.)
After two years of music-hall and
theatre, I’m still the same – face to
face with that painted mentor who gazes
at me from the other side of the
looking-glass, with deep-set eyes under
lids smeared with purplish greasepaint.
191

INT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT

Colette walks down the corridor backstage, past SHOWGIRLS
changing and ACROBATS warming up - her new world, her new
community. She sees Wague who signals to her good luck.

121.

COLETTE (V.O.)
I know she is going to speak to me.
She is going to say: "Is that you
there, all alone under that ceiling
booming and vibrating under the feet
of the dancers? Why are you there, all
alone? And why not somewhere else?”
Yes, this is the dangerous, lucid
hour.
Approaching the stage, we hear the audience chanting "Colette"
over and over in rhythm. The sound gets louder, the audience’s
feet beating a tattoo on the floor; COLETTE, COLETTE, COLETTE.

INT. THEATRE – BACKSTAGE

COLETTE (V.O.)
Now, whenever I despair, I no longer
expect my end, but some bit of luck,
some commonplace little miracle
which, like a glittering link, will
mend again the necklace of my days.
Colette takes a deep breath. The curtain goes up, to thunderous
applause. She walks into the brilliant glow of the footlights,
and disappears into white, like a bird disappearing into the
sun.
TITLES comes up, accompanied by ARCHIVAL PHOTOS and MUSIC.
TITLE
In 1911, Colette’s “The Vagabond,” based on
her music hall experience, was published
under her own name to great critical acclaim.
TITLE (CONT’D)
Missy and Colette continued their relationship
for many years. Missy often accompanied
Colette on her music hall tours, though never
again opted to appear on the stage.
TITLE (CONT’D)
Willy continued to publish ghostwritten books with Meg, but failed to
replicate the success of the Claudines.
He died in 1931 in relative obscurity.
TITLE (CONT’D)
Paul Héon did not destroy the original
Claudine manuscripts but returned them to
Colette. They became crucial evidence in a
1948 legal battle to establish the true
authorship of the novels... that Colette won.

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
TITLE (CONT’D)
Colette went on to publish over fifty
acclaimed novels and short stories. She
became the most celebrated female author in
the history of French literature.
In her old age, Colette remarked, “What a
wonderful life I’ve had. I only wish I’d
realized it sooner.”
