INT. DINER - NIGHT 1 (SOMEWHERE IN OHIO)

1

We’re in the kind of place that feels like everyone should
know your name. But they don’t. Families frequent this spot
when they’ve fallen on hard times. It’s practically empty on
this boring Thursday. SERVERS drop off hot plates while
ELDERLY PEOPLE sip cheap coffee at the counter.
Our focus is directed toward a BLACK MAN and a BLACK WOMAN
sitting in a small booth in the back.
The MAN: has a slender frame and a laid back demeanor. He’s
not a fan of rocking the boat or ruffling feathers, but he
ain’t no punk either. For the purpose of this story we’ll
call him SLIM.
The WOMAN: She’s regal as fuck. She’s not an easy laugh and
she’s always waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the
purposes of this story, we’ll call her QUEEN.
Not unlike most first dates there are long silences and a lot
of forced small talk.
The WAITRESS quickly drops off their food and walks away
without uttering a word. Queen examines the spread.
Slim prays over his food. This is how he was raised. Queen
sits awkwardly waiting for him to look up.
As soon as he does -QUEEN
Didn’t you ask for scrambled eggs?
Yeah.

SLIM

She clocks the two sunny side up eggs on his plate.
SLIM (CONT'D)
It’s all good.
QUEEN
No, it’s not.
SLIM
It’s just eggs.
QUEEN
I have a thing about that.
Eggs?

SLIM

2.
QUEEN
No, about people not doing their
job well.
SLIM
She’s got four kids and an
alcoholic husband at home. She’s
doing the best she can.
QUEEN
How do you know that?
SLIM
She comes through my line every
Sunday, yelling at her kids and
giving me a stack of coupons. She
can never find her Costco card so I
always let her use mine so she can
get the discount.
QUEEN
That’s nice of you.
SLIM
Can I ask you something?
QUEEN
I don’t know, can you?
SLIM
Easy, I know good grammar.
Do you?

QUEEN

SLIM
We not in a classroom.
They have a quick standoff.
QUEEN
You gonna ask me your question or
not?
SLIM
What took you so long to respond to
me?
QUEEN
I didn’t realize that much time had
passed.

3.
SLIM
I sent you a very well crafted
message three weeks ago. I spell
checked it and everything and got
crickets. Then today, out of the
blue, you hit me up asking if I
wanna grab dinner. What changed?
QUEEN
I had a shitty day.
SLIM
What was so shitty about it?
QUEEN
The state decided to execute my
client.
Queen says that as if she were giving him the logline to her
least favorite movie.
In an instant Slim loses his appetite.
SLIM
I didn’t know that was still legal
here.
QUEEN
Yup. It’s legal in 31 states. And
Ohio happens to be one of ‘em.
SLIM
Was he innocent?
QUEEN
Even if he’s not - the state
shouldn’t decide whether he lives
or dies.
I’m sorry.

SLIM

QUEEN
Me too.
(then)
Normally, I’d just go home and have
a glass of wine by myself. But I
didn’t feel like being alone. Not
tonight.
Slim can’t tell if this is a cry for help or a proposition.

4.
SLIM
You didn’t have any friends or
family you could call?
No.

QUEEN

SLIM
So you turned to Tinder?
Yeah.

QUEEN

Slim sips his soda.
SLIM
Why’d you pick me?
QUEEN
I liked your picture.
SLIM
(flattered)
Word?
QUEEN
You had this sad look on your face.
I felt sorry for you.
Damn.

SLIM

QUEEN
I didn’t mean for that to sound
shady.
SLIM
Well it did.
Then -SLIM (CONT'D)
My dad took that picture of me.
QUEEN
Why aren’t you smiling?
Slim shrugs. Not ready to divulge the reason just yet.
They’re still getting to know each other.
SLIM
To be honest, I don’t have that
many photos of myself.

5.

Why not?

QUEEN

SLIM
I know what I look like.
QUEEN
Pictures aren’t just about vanity.
They’re proof of your existence.
SLIM
My family knows I exist. That’s
enough.
The idea of not having to prove oneself to the world is
foreign to Queen.
Slim stares at Queen’s plate. Most of her food is untouched.
Particularly her Caesar salad.
SLIM (CONT'D)
You gon eat that?
QUEEN
You can have some.
He reaches over and stabs a few big pieces of lettuce with
his fork.
SLIM
They always use just the right
amount of dressing.
Then -QUEEN
Do you really like this place or is
it the only spot you could afford?
SLIM
It’s black owned.
She wasn’t expecting that answer. Queen can appreciate this
small token of righteousness.
Touché.

QUEEN
CUT TO:

INT. CAR - AN HOUR LATER - NIGHT 1

2

Slim drives a WHITE HONDA ACCORD. Yeah, he don’t give a fuck
about cars. He tries to create a vibe by playing some neosoul music. Which is regular soul music with a hint of
patchouli.
He keeps looking down at his phone. Checking the directions.
QUEEN
You shouldn’t text and drive.
SLIM
Ain’t nobody texting. I’m making
sure I don’t get lost.
She grabs Slim’s phone from his lap.
QUEEN
I can tell you how to get to my
hotel.
SLIM
Give me my phone!
QUEEN
Relax. I’m gonna give it back.
SLIM
You gon tell me where to turn?
Yeah.

QUEEN

Queen points left.
SLIM
Oh so now you gon point the
directions?
QUEEN
I’m telling you where to go.
Slim is visibly annoyed. Queen starts sifting through his
phone.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
You made a playlist? That’s cute.
Slim tries to grab his phone back, unsuccessfully.
SLIM
Don’t go through my phone!

7.
She smiles.
QUEEN
Did you like “In a Sentimental
Mood” before or after “Love Jones”?
SLIM
I knew about that shit way before
“Love Jones.”
Don’t lie.

QUEEN

SLIM
Okay - I fucked with it more after
I saw the movie.
QUEEN
I appreciate your honesty.
Then -SLIM
So what happens tonight?
QUEEN
You’re gonna drop me off and you’ll
go home, I guess.
Oh.

SLIM

QUEEN
Did you think we were gonna have
sex?
Slim is embarrassed.
SLIM
No. I thought we were gonna hang
out. Maybe get to know each other.
QUEEN
Nah, I’m good.
Slim takes his phone back from Queen causing him to SWERVE a
bit. Then he SWITCHES LANES without signaling.
Just as he starts to pick up speed. He hears a horrifying
sound. WOOP WOOP. Every black person’s worst nightmare.

8.
We hear a robotic voice muffled through a loud speaker: “Pull
over. That corner right there.”
Slim’s heart starts to race. Queen’s heart beats at its usual
speed.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Do you have any warrants?
Really?
Do you?

SLIM
QUEEN

SLIM
Nah, I ain’t got no warrants.
QUEEN
Do you have any weapons in the car?
Any narcotics?
SLIM
I got a pocket knife in the glove
compartment.
QUEEN
That’s fine.
SLIM
I know it is.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 1

The POLICE OFFICER steps out of his car and makes his way to
Slim’s door.
He motions for Slim to roll down his window. He does.
POLICE OFFICER
Can you turn the radio down?
Slim pauses for a beat. Then he does as he’s told. He’s
always been good at being obedient.
The Police Officer aims the light directly in Slim’s eyes.
Slim quickly shields his face so he can see what’s in front
of him.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Put your hand down.
He does as he’s told.

9.
QUEEN
He only had it up because you were
shining a light in his eyes.
POLICE OFFICER
I’m trying to see inside the
vehicle.
QUEEN
It’s just us.
POLICE OFFICER
License and registration.
Slim reaches for his wallet.
SLIM
I’m grabbing my wallet.
POLICE OFFICER
I can see that.
QUEEN
(under her breath)
Well, y’all like to shoot first and
ask questions later.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you have something you wanna say
to me?
QUEEN
No, I don’t.
Slim hands over his license. Slowly. As he reaches over to
rummage through his glove compartment his hand accidentally
grazes Queen’s thigh. He’s not being fresh. Just nervous. He
finally finds his crumpled up registration and hands it over.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you know why I pulled you over?
No, sir.

SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
You forgot to use your signal back
there. And you swerved a bit.
Queen shakes her head.
SLIM
Oh, my bad.

10.
POLICE OFFICER
Yeah, it is.
The Police Officer takes Slim’s license and registration and
slowly walks back to his squad car.
Queen sits there. Seething. Slim is calm as a cucumber.
QUEEN
I can’t believe this shit.
SLIM
Just chill.
She doesn’t like being told what to do.
Excuse me?

QUEEN

SLIM
I told you to chill out.
QUEEN
I have a right to be angry.
SLIM
I ain’t tryna die tonight.
The weight of that statement leaps out of Slim’s soul and
lands in Queen’s lap.

INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1

4

The Police Officer talks to his DISPATCHER.
On his dashboard we see a PHOTO. It’s a picture of his WIFE
and KIDS.
The Kids are TWIN BOYS. They both have blonde hair and green
eyes. They’re completely unaware of how privileged their
lives will be simply because they were born white and male.
The Wife is a bored brunette whose dreams are no bigger than
her backyard.
DISPATCHER
Whattya got?
POLICE OFFICER
Black male. Black female. Both late
twenties. They’re in a white Honda.
(MORE)

11.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Driver changed lanes without
signaling. He was driving
erratically.
DISPATCHER
Is he under the influence?
POLICE OFFICER
I don’t know yet. I’ll make him do
a breathalyzer.
DISPATCHER
Let me know if you need anything.
Will do.

POLICE OFFICER

INT. SLIM'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1

The Officer is back at Slim’s window - leaning in a little
too close.
POLICE OFFICER
Will you step out of the vehicle,
please?
QUEEN
(under her breath)
Shit.
SLIM
Can I ask why, Officer?
POLICE OFFICER
No, you can’t. Step out of the car.
Before he gets out of the car Queen and Slim lock eyes. He
doesn’t know Queen very well, but he can tell she has the
spirit of Nat Turner wrestling inside of her.
Slim steps out and puts his hands on the roof of the car. The
Police Officer proceeds to search him, aggressively.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
You got any sharp objects in your
pockets I should know about?
No, sir.

SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
Any illegal substances?

12.

No, sir.

SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
What about in the vehicle?
No, sir.

SLIM
CUT TO:

INT. SLIM’S CAR - PASSENGER SEAT - SAME TIME - NIGHT 1

Queen’s left knee bounces uncontrollably. Her chest goes up
and down.
Queen looks in the rearview mirror and sees the Police
Officer interrogating Slim on the side of the road.
CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1
The Police Officer finishes patting Slim down.
POLICE OFFICER
Have you been drinking tonight?
No.

SLIM

Slim laughs.
POLICE OFFICER
Why is that funny?
SLIM
Cause I don’t drink.
POLICE OFFICER
Do me a favor, pop the trunk.
Why?

SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
Because I asked you to.
Slim hesitates.

13.
SLIM
Ain’t nothing in there but some
shoe boxes.
POLICE OFFICER
Let’s see ‘em.
Okay.

SLIM

Queen HONKS the horn in an effort to get the Police Officer’s
attention.
POLICE OFFICER
Can I help you?
QUEEN
Do you have a warrant?
POLICE OFFICER
Ma’am, he’s already agreed to the
search. So I don’t need one.
Slim pops the trunk.
He was telling the truth. The only thing in his trunk are a
bunch of sneakers. Consumerism is his only vice.
Slim feels vindicated and violated at the same time.
Told you.

SLIM

QUEEN (O.S.)
Can we go now?
The Officer’s cheeks turn bright red.
POLICE OFFICER
What’s in the boxes?
Shoes.

SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
I’m gonna check just to be sure.
Fine.

SLIM

Then.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Can you please hurry up?

14.
And just like that a SWITCH GOES OFF in the Police Officer’s
head. He feels disrespected. His uniform isn’t as
intimidating as he thought it was. His super powers are
imaginary. So he goes from 2018 to 1953 real quick.
He PULLS OUT HIS GUN and AIMS IT AT SLIM.
POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground and put your
hands behind your back, now!
SLIM
Are you serious?
POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground!
Slim does as he’s told.
The Officer keeps the gun pointed at Slim’s head while
looking at Slim’s car to make sure Queen stays inside.
But after a beat she GETS OUT OF THE CAR to see what the fuck
is going on.
QUEEN
Why is he under arrest?
The Officer turns around and AIMS HIS GUN AT HER. With one
hand. The other hand stays planted on Slim’s shoulder.
POLICE OFFICER
Ma’am if you don’t get back in the
car I’m gonna have to arrest you
too.
QUEEN
I’m happy to get back in the car,
but would you mind telling me why
you’re arresting him?
POLICE OFFICER
Get back in the vehicle now!
QUEEN
I’m reaching for my cell phone -POLICE OFFICER
Keep your hands where I can see
them!!
QUEEN
I have the right to record this
arrest.

15.
Queen REACHES in her pocket.
Officer Reed AIMS HIS GUN AT HER and FIRES OFF TWO SHOTS.
BOOM! BOOM!
The first shot misses her, but the SECOND SHOT GRAZES HER
RIGHT THIGH. She collapses to the ground. And hits her head
on the pavement.
Slim SCREAMS for her. He tries to run toward her, but Officer
Reed grabs him by the shoulders and slams him on the ground.
Officer Reed and Slim roll around on the ground for a few
seconds. Until Officer Reed finally pins Slim to the ground
and points the gun at his face.
OFFICER REED
Don’t move!
Officer Reed sees Queen trying to get up. He points his gun
at her again - while the Officer’s attention is diverted Slim KNOCKS the firearm out of his hand.
When the gun goes flying - Officer Reed reaches for it, but
Slim gets to it first.
When Slim turns around he sees Officer Reed LUNGING toward
him.
Slim FIRES the gun! BOOM.
HE SHOOTS OFFICER REED IN THE NECK. Killing him instantly.
Slim drops the gun and stops breathing. Queen muffles her own
scream.
Officer Reed’s lifeless body lies on the pavement. A pool of
blood quickly forms around him.
Queen applies pressure to her fresh wound and winces in pain.
Slim gets up and runs to her side. He sees the blood running
down her leg.
Oh shit!

SLIM

He tries to help her up, but she doesn’t want his assistance.
I got it.

QUEEN

She slowly stands up. Gritting her teeth the entire time.
Independence hurts.

16.
Queen looks at the dead Police Officer.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Are you okay?
Physically yes. Emotionally no.
Yeah.

SLIM

Slim puts Queen’s arm around his neck. He knows she’s
struggling to stand on one good leg.
She kneels down and grabs the gun. Then she gently shoves it
in his pants.
It’s their gun now.
Queen turns to face Officer Reed’s squad car. The headlights
are still on. Giving the small CAMERA on the DASHBOARD a
perfect view of her face.
Let’s go.

QUEEN

Slim looks at her for a long beat.
SLIM
We can’t just leave him here.
QUEEN
Yes, we can. Now let’s go.
Slim walks Queen back to the car. The engine is still
purring. He helps her into the passenger seat.
Slim walks around to the other side and gets in the driver’s
seat. Still in shock.
As they drive off into the darkness all we hear is the static
filled radio coming from the squad car.
MALE VOICE
Officer Reed? Officer Reed, do you
need back up? Officer Reed, do you
copy?
As we hear sirens far off in the distance, we -CUT TO:

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1

Slim drives faster than his car is used to going. No music is
playing. They’re no longer wrapping up a date. Now they’re
fugitives, on the run. And one of them is wounded.
Slim has no idea where they’re going. Neither does Queen.
He’s just driving. Aimlessly.
Slim grabs his phone.
SLIM
I gotta call my dad.
Queen snatches his phone and tosses it out the window. She
chucks hers as well.
SLIM (CONT'D)
What the fuck are you doing?
QUEEN
We can’t call anybody. It’ll make
them accomplices.
SLIM
You could’ve just said that shit.
Now we ain’t got no phones.
QUEEN
A phone ain’t nothing but a
tracking device anyway.
Slim is shell shocked as Queen tries to take deep breaths.
SLIM
You’re bleeding a lot.
QUEEN
It’s okay it only grazed me.
The severity of what they did starts to sink in.
SLIM
Fuck! Why didn’t you just stay in
the car?
QUEEN
So this is my fault?
SLIM
You should’ve just let me handle
it.

18.
QUEEN
If I didn’t get out the car you’d
be dead right now.
Slim looks at her wound. There’s a big gash.
SLIM
We gotta get you to a hospital.
QUEEN
No! We can’t. Just keep driving.
Here --

SLIM

Slim takes off his jacket while driving.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Use my jacket as a bandage.
She balls it up and presses it against her leg. It hurts like
hell.
Fuck!

QUEEN

SLIM
I have a small bottle of bourbon
under the seat.
She looks at him with judgmental eyes.
QUEEN
I thought you didn’t drink.
SLIM
I don’t. My cousin stole that from
a hotel and left it in my car.
She grabs it and pours some on her open wound. Queen grits
her teeth and presses against it to stop the bleeding.
Slim’s mind starts to race. He can’t sit still.
SLIM (CONT'D)
What if he was wearing a body cam?
Or had a camera in his car. This
shit bout to be all over the
fucking news.
QUEEN
That’s why we have to keep going.

19.
SLIM
We can’t run forever.
QUEEN
I know that. But right now we have
to run until we come up with a
better plan.
SLIM
Well, start throwing out some
ideas.
QUEEN
Since when am I in charge of coming
up with the ideas?
SLIM
Since you made the decision to run.
QUEEN
We made that decision together.
SLIM
I don’t remember that.
QUEEN
We ain’t turning ourselves in, I
know that much.
SLIM
If people watch the tape they’ll
see what happened.
QUEEN
Yeah - they’ll see you shooting a
police officer, you idiot!
SLIM
Man, fuck this!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 1

Slim pulls the car over. He gets out and just starts walking.
QUEEN
What the fuck are you doing? Are
you crazy?
Queen limps out and hurries after him. Slim walks aimlessly
up the road.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Where are you going?

20.
SLIM
I’mma find somebody with a phone so
I can call my family.
QUEEN
If you do that they’ll know where
we are.
Great.

SLIM

QUEEN
What if they kill us?
That stops Slim in his tracks. He turns to look at her.
SLIM
Don’t say that.
QUEEN
There’s no guarantee they won’t.
Then.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
You’re a black man that killed a
cop and then you took his gun.
SLIM
We took it for protection.
Exactly.

QUEEN

SLIM
I’m not a criminal.
QUEEN
You are now.
Slim stares at her.
SLIM
I just want to go home. I wanna see
my family.
Slim’s eyes start to water. Queen grabs his hand.
QUEEN
If you turn yourself in - you’ll
never see them again.
And just like that. Something in Slim shifts. He feels
powerless and small.

21.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
All we can do is go forward.
There’s nothing back there for us.
Please. Let’s just keep going.
SLIM
What about your family? You don’t
care about leaving them behind?
QUEEN
No. I don’t.
SLIM
We can’t just keep driving. We need
to figure out what the fuck we gon
do.
QUEEN
Alright, let’s go to my uncle’s
house. We can stay there for a few
days. Then we can figure out our
next move.
SLIM
Where does your Uncle live?
QUEEN
New Orleans.
SLIM
That’s hours from here.
QUEEN
Then we should get going.
They slowly walk back to the car. Hand in hand.

Slim blasts GOSPEL music. Queen stares out the window.
Pissed.
QUEEN
Can you please turn that shit down?
SLIM
It’s the only thing that calms me.
QUEEN
Well I can’t hear myself think.

A10

22.
SLIM
I don’t care.
She turns it down.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Don’t touch my shit.
Pull over.
Why?

QUEEN
SLIM

QUEEN
So I can get out.
SLIM
You ain’t going nowhere. We in this
together now.
All she can do is fold her arms and roll her eyes - because
she knows he’s right.

INT. SLIM’S CAR - HOURS LATER - NIGHT 1

10

Slim and Queen’s hearts are still racing. Then the car starts
to slow down.
QUEEN
Why you slowing down?
SLIM
I’m outta gas.
Then the car comes to a complete stop. They can no longer
ride on fumes.
QUEEN
Why didn’t you say something?
SLIM
What you mean why ain’t I say
something? I had other shit on my
mind.
They sit there quietly for a beat. Then they see a flash of
light. Headlights to be exact.
QUEEN
Okay, we gotta flag this car down.

23.
SLIM
I hope they black.
QUEEN
(to herself)
That’s not always a good thing.
They both step out of the car. Nervous as hell.
CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1

As the car gets closer and closer, Queen realizes QUEEN
Oh fuck. The driver’s wearing a
cowboy hat.
Dammit.

SLIM

Slim crosses himself. Hoping for the best.
The DRIVER is Mexican. His smile is friendly and his demeanor
is warm.
DRIVER
Y’all having car trouble?
QUEEN
Uh, yeah, we ran out of gas.
The Driver sees Queen’s leg is covered in blood.
DRIVER
Ma’am, are you okay?
QUEEN
Yeah, I accidentally cut myself.
He looks at Slim and wonders if he’s stumbled upon a domestic
dispute.
DRIVER
Why don’t you guys hop in my truck?
I’ve got a first aid kit in my
backseat. And there’s a gas station
up the road. I’ll give you a ride.
SLIM
We don’t mind walking.

DRIVER
Come on. I won’t bite.

They get in the truck. Slim immediately spots a SHERIFF’S
BADGE sitting on the dash. While Queen climbs in the
backseat.
Fuck.
What?
What?

SLIM
SHERIFF
SLIM

SHERIFF
Something wrong?
SLIM
Uh no. I just didn’t know you were
a sheriff.
Queen looks up. Freaked out.
SHERIFF
Oh yeah, I’m off duty today.
He pulls off.
CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

A13

Queen tries to take deep breaths while she bandages herself
up. The bleeding has finally stopped. She uses a lot of gauze
and tape because she doesn’t know when she’ll be able to rebandage it. It looks a mess - cause she obviously doesn’t
know what she’s doing.
Slim sits up front, sweating bullets.
SLIM
You know what. We can walk the rest
of the way.

25.
SHERIFF
Nah, I’ll let this be my good deed
for the day.
Uh okay.

SLIM

SHERIFF
Y’all okay? You seem jumpy.
QUEEN
No, we’re fine. We just made a
wrong turn somewhere and got lost.
SLIM
Where are we?
SHERIFF
You’re in Kentucky, my friend, but
don’t worry - we’ll get you some
gas and you’ll be on your way.
(then)
How’s your leg?
QUEEN
Much better. Thank you.

EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1

The Sheriff looks at them for a beat. They stare back,
confused.
SHERIFF
Gas costs money.
SLIM
Oh shit, I left all my stuff in the
car.
Me too.

QUEEN

SLIM
I can pay you back when we get to
the car.
The Sheriff takes pity on them and walks into the gas
station.

INT. GAS STATION - COUNTER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1

The Sheriff grabs a red jug for the gas to go in and then he
walks up to THE CASHIER.
SHERIFF
I need to fill this up.
CASHIER
That’ll be ten bucks.
The Sheriff hands him the money. Then he looks out the window
and sees Queen and Slim standing by his car.
A VOICE from his walkie gives him an update.
VOICE
A Police Officer was shot and
killed by two assailants in Ohio. A
male and a female. Both AfricanAmerican. One of the suspects was
wounded by the officer. They’re
said to be armed and dangerous.
Let’s just keep our eyes open.
He stares daggers at Queen and Slim. They can feel his eyes
on them.

EXT. GAS STATION - SAME TIME - NIGHT 1

Queen has her hand on the passenger door. Slim paces back and
forth.
QUEEN
Stop pacing.
SLIM
I can’t help it.
QUEEN
You look guilty.
SLIM
I am guilty.
QUEEN
Have you been charged with
something?
No.

SLIM

27.
QUEEN
Then you’re not guilty.
SLIM
Why is he staring at us like that?
QUEEN
I don’t know.

The Cashier hands the Sheriff a receipt.
CASHIER
Do you need anything else?
SHERIFF
Hold on a second.
He grabs his walkie and talks into it.
SHERIFF (CONT'D)
What kind of car were they in?
VOICE
A white Honda.
SHERIFF
Any other info?
VOICE
We’re still waiting for the dash
cam footage to come in.
CUT TO:

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 1

QUEEN
Get in the driver’s seat.
SLIM
Are you crazy?
QUEEN
Just do it. Quick.
Slim hops into the driver’s seat. Queen gets in the passenger

The Sheriff holds the red jug up to the driver side window.
Startling them.
SHERIFF
Were y’all gon leave without me?
And before he can blink - Queen holds the dead police
officer’s gun to his head.
QUEEN
Get in the car.
The Sheriff does as he’s told. Without alarming anyone.

The Sheriff is driving while Queen holds a gun to the back of
his head from the backseat. Slim is in the passenger seat
wishing he could make himself disappear.
SHERIFF
My name is Edgar. I’ve lived in
Kentucky all my life. My wife died
three years ago and now I’m raising
our son by myself. I’m all he has
in the world. Watching him grow up
has been the greatest blessing of
my life.
QUEEN
Don’t worry. I’m not gonna kill
you.
After a beat.
SHERIFF
Did y’all kill that police officer?
SLIM
It was self defense.
SHERIFF
I’m sure it was. I have some
colleagues that have gotten out of
line more than once.

They’re back at Slim’s car. Queen keeps the gun to his head.
The Sheriff keeps his hands where she can see them. Queen
looks a the Sheriff’s truck and then she looks at Slim’s car.
Then -QUEEN
Pop the trunk.
Why?

SLIM

QUEEN
Just do it.
Slim does as he’s told. Then she looks at The Sheriff.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Get inside, please.
The Sheriff struggles to get inside Slim’s trunk. There’s a
lot of shoeboxes in there.
He finally gets inside.
Once he’s in the trunk Queen leans over him.
SHERIFF
I don’t know what happened. But
whatever it was, I’m sure you had
good reason for doing what you did.
Please. Let me help you.
Queen just looks at him, with hurt and anger in her eyes and
SLAMS the trunk closed.
SLIM
What’d you do that for? He wanted
to help us.
QUEEN
He ain’t gon help us.
Slim takes a deep breath trying to calm himself down.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
It’s their job to make you feel
like everything will be okay. But
the second you confess you become
property of the state. Is that what
you want? You wanna be the state’s
property?

30.

No.

SLIM

Queen gets in the driver’s seat of the pick up truck and
leans her head out the window.
QUEEN
You coming?
Slim hops in the truck - and they’re off.

pulled over again.
Queen wants to run away so bad. That’s her pattern. But she
can’t this time. She’s trapped.
QUEEN
I’m hungry.
Me too.

SLIM

He sees a few fast food spots up ahead.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Just stop at McDonalds or
something.
QUEEN
That’s disgusting.

Queen spots a few BROWN BOYS failing miserably at skateboard
tricks in the parking lot. She sits up in her seat and locks
eyes with one of them.
He has a lot of meat on his bones and a face covered in
freckles. We’ll call him CHUBBY. She WAVES him over. Slim
clocks this and freaks out.
SLIM
What you doing?
The BOYS don’t even try to stop Chubby from walking over.
They just keep busting their asses on the pavement.
QUEEN
You wanna get some free food and
make a little money?
CHUBBY
What’s the catch?
SLIM
Ain’t no catch, lil man.
Aight.

CHUBBY

Queen hands him the last twenty dollar bill from her wallet.
SLIM
Let me get a double cheeseburger
and the ten piece chicken nuggets
with sweet and sour sauce.
QUEEN
I’ll have a chicken sandwich with
no condiments and a small fry. You
can keep the change.
CHUBBY
Ain’t gon be much left after all

Slim eats fast and loud. Queen eats like a rabbit. She
watches him devour his food with a disgusted look on her
face.
QUEEN
You make a lot of noise when you
eat.
SLIM
Woman, this could be my last meal would you just let me be?
QUEEN
It’s hard for me to eat with you
making so much noise.
Slim tries to eat quieter. He fails, but Queen appreciates
the gesture.
SLIM
I’ve never heard of someone not
being able to eat because they’re
disgusted by the sounds of other
people eating.
QUEEN
I know it’s weird, but I have a
thing about it.
SLIM
How do you avoid the sounds of
people eating?
QUEEN
I eat alone most of the time.
SLIM
That’s not surprising.
She cuts her eyes at him. Slim stops eating for a second.
SLIM (CONT'D)
You scared?
No.

QUEEN

SLIM
You’re lying.
QUEEN
How do you know?

33.
SLIM
You answered too fast.
QUEEN
I thought if a person answered too
fast it meant they were telling the
truth.
SLIM
My dad always told me if a person
answers too quick it means they had
the lie ready to go.
QUEEN
Wow. Well that’s good to know.
SLIM
How do you know if your clients are
telling the truth?
I don’t.

QUEEN

SLIM
Then how can you defend them?
QUEEN
That’s my job.
SLIM
But why do you do it?
QUEEN
I refuse to let certain states swap
out a southern tree for an electric
chair and call it justice.
A beat.
SLIM
Are you a good lawyer?
QUEEN
I’m an excellent lawyer.
SLIM
Why do black people always feel the
need to be excellent? Why can’t we
just be ourselves?
QUEEN
We should go.

34.
She hops down and gets in the passenger side. Slim wonders
why she was so abrupt just then. Maybe he struck a nerve.
He shakes it off and hops in the drivers seat. But before
they can pull off he hears -CHUBBY (O.S.)
Hey, is this y’all?
Chubby plays them a video on his phone. It’s the DASH CAM
FOOTAGE of Slim shooting Officer Reed in the neck.
The video has already been viewed by over a hundred thousand
people.
SLIM
Nah, man. That ain’t us.
Slim gets spooked and quickly starts the car. Chubby keeps
banging on the window.
CHUBBY
Hold on, my dad wanna talk to
y’all!
As soon as he pulls forward he feels an IMPACT. He HIT
something. Or someone.
Daddy!!!

CHUBBY (CONT'D)

Slim gets out of the car. Queen stays inside.
Slim spots a LARGE BLACK MAN laying on the ground. Slim goes
to touch him, but he flinches.
SLIM
I’m so sorry. I didn’t see you.
CHUBBY
You almost killed my daddy!
LARGE BLACK MAN
I think you hit my bad knee.
SLIM
Can you move it?
He tries to and then he SCREAMS in pain. Chubby starts
crying.
CHUBBY
You broke my daddy leg!

35.
LARGE BLACK MAN
Stop crying like a lil bitch. I’ll
be alright.
CHUBBY
Mommy told you to stop calling me a
lil bitch.
LARGE BLACK MAN
Nigga, I’ll call you whatever the
fuck I want.
Queen hops out of the car to move this along.
QUEEN
We have to go now.
CHUBBY
Y’all gotta take him to the
hospital.
QUEEN
We can’t go to a hospital.
CHUBBY
So I can get y’all food, but you
can’t take my daddy to the
hospital?
Large Black Man moans in pain every time he tries to move his
leg.
SLIM
Where’s the nearest hospital?
QUEEN
We don’t have time for this.
SLIM
Would you calm down!
QUEEN
Don’t talk to me like that.
SLIM
I’ll talk to you however I wanna
talk to you.
LARGE BLACK MAN
Ya’ll sound like me and my bitch.
CHUBBY
Don’t call my mama a bitch!

36.
LARGE BLACK MAN
I ain’t talking bout yo mama.
Slim tries to help the Large Black Man to his feet.
SLIM
Come on, we’re gonna take you to a
hospital.
Slim, Queen, and Chubby all grab a limb and help him into the
back of the pick up truck.

Slim drives carefully as to not irritate the Large Black
Man’s injury. Chubby holds his dad’s hand the whole way.
LARGE BLACK MAN
I support what y’all are doing.
QUEEN
What do you mean?
LARGE BLACK MAN
Killing these crooked ass cops. We
need to take all these muthafuckas
out.
SLIM
That’s not what we’re doing.
LARGE BLACK MAN
I saw the video, okay. If a cop
shot at my bitch, I’d kill his ass
too.
Queen and Slim look at each other. Their hearts are racing.
LARGE BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
Cop killllaaaaassss!!!
SLIM
Shut the fuck up, man!
LARGE BLACK MAN
Are y’all the new Black Panthers!?
Is that what this is?
No!

SLIM

LARGE BLACK MAN
This is revenge.
For what?

SLIM

LARGE BLACK MAN
For that nigga he kilt two years
ago.
What?

QUEEN

CHUBBY
Some dude was taking his daughter
to school, minding his own
business, and that cop killed him
for no reason.
Queen remembers the case. Slim cuts his eyes at her.
SLIM
Did you know about this?
QUEEN
Of course not.
He doesn’t know what to believe. Then -QUEEN (CONT'D)
The hospital’s on the left, pull
over!

Slim swerves into the driveway.
SLIM
Alright. We’re here.
CHUBBY
Y’all gon help me with him or nah?
LARGE BLACK MAN
They gotta lay low. It’s probably
cameras all up and through this
bitch.
Chubby opens the car door and drapes his dad’s arm around his
neck. He stumbles a little bit, but eventually he makes it
out and walks up to the sliding doors of URGENT CARE.

Before Slim can pull off, the Large Black Man turns around
and says -LARGE BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
Power to the people.
He raises his right fist then he limps inside.

Slim and Queen continue driving through Kentucky. They see
rolling hills and tall phone lines that look like crosses.
SLIM
How long before a helicopter starts
flying over us?
QUEEN
I don’t know.
SLIM
Please tell me you didn’t fuck with
that cop on purpose.
QUEEN
Of course not.
SLIM
You seemed real calm when you saw
his dead body.
QUEEN
He shot at me.
SLIM
You’re crazy, man.
QUEEN
It should be a sin to call a black
woman crazy.
SLIM
You one of those people that thinks
God is a black woman?
QUEEN
I don’t believe in God.
SLIM
Lord help me.

Queen clocks the almost empty gas tank.
QUEEN
You’re on E.
Fuck.

SLIM

QUEEN
I really need you to start paying
attention to that shit.
SLIM
Why don’t you pay attention?
QUEEN
You driving.
A beat.
SLIM
I don’t think it’s smart for us to
be walking into gas stations.
QUEEN
It’s not that scary. I told you
what to do.
SLIM
You only saying that cause you
don’t have to do it.

You got this. I believe in you.

Slim stands in front of a TEENAGE WHITE BOY. This is his part

Slim looks at the newspapers stacked in front of him. Him and
Queen’s faces are on the cover.
The word “WANTED” rests above their heads in bold black
letters.

40.
SLIM
Let me get forty on pump nine.
The Teenager waits for Slim to hand over the money.
But instead - Slim lifts up his shirt and shows his gun.
That’s his currency.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY
Is that a .45?
Yeah.

SLIM

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
Can I hold it?
SLIM
No, you can’t.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY
I’ll pay for your gas if you let me
hold it.
SLIM
That’s not a fair trade.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY
If you don’t let me hold it you’ll have to stick up another gas
station.
SLIM
I could kill you right now.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY
You don’t look like a killer to me.
Slim appreciates the fact this young man can see he’s not a
cold blooded killer.
After a beat he takes the gun out of his pants and hands it
over. The kid goes from being an innocent Teenager to John
Wayne in a matter of seconds.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY (CONT'D)
Why does holding a deadly weapon
make me feel so alive?
Then he aims the gun at Slim’s head. They stare at each other
for a long beat. Slim starts to shake. The teenager holds the
gun steady. Barely shaking at all. While Slim fears for his
life.

41.
SLIM
What the fuck is you doing?
The Teenager starts laughing and puts the gun down.
TEENAGE WHITE BOY
I’m just messing with you.
The Teenager puts forty bucks in the register and activates
the gas pump. Then hands the gun back to Slim.
And just like that he goes back to being a kid again.

EXT. HOUSE - FIVE HOURS LATER - DAY 2

They arrive in New Orleans.
They pull up to a house far off the beaten path. It’s big,
but not well kept. This house used to be owned by people who
cared for it, but its new inhabitants could care less.
Queen BANGS on the door.
SLIM
Damn, why you knocking like you the
police?
No answer. She knocks again.
SLIM (CONT'D)
If you didn’t throw our phones out
the window we could’ve called.
QUEEN
If I didn’t throw our phones out
the window the police would’ve
caught us by now.
Touché.

SLIM

This brings a small smile to Queen’s face.
Then she keeps knocking. Until a TALL BLACK GIRL, with a fire
in her belly and a glimmer in her eye, answers the door. She
looks like the romantic interest in every hip hop music video
ever made.
TALL BLACK GIRL
Can I help you?

42.
QUEEN
Is my uncle here?
TALL BLACK GIRL
Who’s your uncle?

Her eyes widen as Slim and Queen walk by.
GODDESS

Queen opens the door to find her UNCLE EARL peeling shrimp.
He’s rocking a red velour track suit and has a bald head. He
stands up and looks at Queen.
From the look on his face they haven’t seen each other in a
while.
Uncle Earl wipes his hands and walks over to give her a hug.
The embrace is one-sided.
UNCLE EARL
Well, if it isn’t the black Bonnie
and Clyde.
Earl reaches out to shake Slim’s hand. Earl’s hand is twice
the size of his.
QUEEN
I don’t know what the news is
saying, but whatever it is - it’s
not true.

43.
UNCLE EARL
You know I don’t fuck with the
news. I keep my ear to the streets.

The streets lie too.
UNCLE EARL
They know better than to lie to me.
Y’all hungry?

Uncle Earl cooks up some CREAMY SHRIMP SCAMPI ALFREDO. It
looks amazing. He makes plates for Slim, Queen, and the two
beautiful girls we saw earlier.
UNCLE EARL
I always hoped you’d escape this
life without getting shot at.
He leans back.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
Who patched you up?
She did.

SLIM

UNCLE EARL
You ain’t do a good job.
Earl stares at Queen for a long beat. A little too long.
Causing her to look away.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
What’s your plan?
QUEEN
We need to figure that out.
UNCLE EARL
Well, y’all need to hurry up cause
the cops are like slave catchers.
They can smell a runaway from miles
away.
I’m aware.

QUEEN

UNCLE EARL
How you gon outrun the police?

44.
QUEEN
We don’t have to outrun them. We
just have to make sure they don’t
know where we are.
UNCLE EARL
That ain’t hard to do. Cops are
dumb as shit.
TALL BLACK GIRL
Not all of ‘em.
UNCLE EARL
She only saying that cause she used
to fuck one of them muthafuckas.
TALL BLACK GIRL
Don’t be jealous.
UNCLE EARL
I ain’t jealous of nobody. Niggas
jealous of me.
Before this turns into a bigger fight Queen interrupts.
QUEEN
We might need to stay here for a
little while.
UNCLE EARL
Hell nah. The SWAT team probably
already on they way. And I can’t
have them muscle neck muthafuckas
sniffing around my shit.
This puts the fear of God in Slim.
QUEEN
So what are we supposed to do?
UNCLE EARL
I don’t know.
QUEEN
So you just gon let us get killed?
UNCLE EARL
That’s the risk you take.
QUEEN
Fuck you, Earl.
She gets up to leave. Slim follows her. Goddess looks at Earl
with puppy dog eyes. Her charm is hard to resist.

45.
UNCLE EARL
How long y’all need to stay?
QUEEN
A night or two.
UNCLE EARL
Well which one is it?
QUEEN
Two nights.
Fine.

UNCLE EARL

QUEEN
We need some cash.
How much?

UNCLE EARL

QUEEN
Enough to last us for a few days.
What else?

UNCLE EARL

QUEEN
We need one of your cars.
UNCLE EARL
You can kiss my black ass.
TALL BLACK GIRL
He love those cars more than he
love us.
QUEEN
You want me to sign the house over
to you or not?
UNCLE EARL
You always tryna blackmail
somebody.
Then -UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
I ain’t got no extra cars just
laying around.
GODDESS
What about the Cadillac?

46.
UNCLE EARL
Goddess, if you don’t shut the fuck
up.
SLIM
I don’t know how inconspicuous we
gon be riding around in a Cadillac.
QUEEN
That’s the whole point. We’ll be
hiding in plain sight.
Goddess sits on Earl’s lap.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Do you agree to my terms or not?
UNCLE EARL
I’m not giving you no car.
She gets in his face.
QUEEN
You owe me.
Those three words stab him in his stomach. Slim tries to read
the situation, but can’t make sense of it.
UNCLE EARL
You sure this how you want me to
pay you back?
Queen nods.
Okay.

UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)

Earl gets up and grabs the CAR KEYS from a drawer nearby. He
tosses them to Slim. Slim doesn’t catch them.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
You need to figure out what the
fuck you gon do when you leave
here.
We will.

QUEEN

Earl looks at Slim.
UNCLE EARL
She talk for both of y’all?

47.

No.

SLIM

UNCLE EARL
Could’ve fooled me.
QUEEN
Don’t do that.
UNCLE EARL
I just wanna know what the nigga’s
thinking. Cause he look kinda slow
to me.
SLIM
I think we should go to Cuba.
UNCLE EARL
Now we talking! Ain’t that where
Assata went after she killed that
state trooper?
QUEEN
Allegedly killed.
SLIM
We just gotta keep driving until we
get to Miami and then -QUEEN
We’ll be standing in front of a
large body of water. How are we
supposed to cross that?
SLIM
I don’t know yet.
QUEEN
Of course you don’t.
UNCLE EARL
You got a better idea?
For once she doesn’t. She gets up to leave.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
Where you think you going?
QUEEN
To lay down. I’m exhausted.
UNCLE EARL
Y’all ain’t going nowhere until we
shave yo heads.

48.
QUEEN
We’re not doing that.
UNCLE EARL
You wanna keep walking around
looking how you look in that video?
QUEEN
We’ll be fine.
UNCLE EARL
No, you won’t.
QUEEN
You’re not shaving my head.
UNCLE EARL
Fine. I believe women have the
right to choose - but you don’t.

GODDESS
Take whatever you want. You can

Thank you.

QUEEN

Then -GODDESS
Can I look at your leg?
QUEEN
Nah, I’m okay.
GODDESS

Queen feels bad for judging her.
Alright.

Goddess helps Queen take her pants off. Goddess slowly pulls
the bandage away. Queen winces.
GODDESS
Don’t worry. I got you.
They lock eyes. Goddess smiles at her. Queen smiles back.
GODDESS (CONT'D)
I didn’t know Earl had a niece.
QUEEN
We’re not close.
GODDESS
Is he related to your mother or
your father?
QUEEN
My mother. She and I weren’t close
either.

GODDESS
Damn, who are you close to?
She shrugs.
QUEEN
Are you close to your family?
GODDESS
Yeah. They don’t care how I make my
money as long as I’m happy.
Are you?
Sometimes.

QUEEN
GODDESS

QUEEN
What makes you happy?
GODDESS
Robes at fancy hotels. A good lace
front. And when your uncle kisses
me on my forehead.
Queen wasn’t expecting that answer.
What?

GODDESS (CONT'D)

QUEEN
Nothing. I’m just surprised by the
amount of love he has in his life.
GODDESS
He don’t always deserve it, but he
needs us to worship him. Out there
he ain’t shit. But in here - he a
king.
Queen let’s that sink in. She marvels at Goddess’ thin frame
as she cleans her leg with precision.
In another life Goddess could’ve been a nurse with an
affordable mortgage, but in this one she occupies the
fantasies of working class men who will never understand how
innocent she really is.

She looks up and sees Slim leaning against the stove. With
his newly shaved head. He looks like the second lead vocalist

She looks nervous.

It’s one of a kind. I designed it

Earl gets up and SLAPS her with the back of his hand. She
falls out of the chair and hits the floor hard.
Then she QUICKLY gets up and smacks his face.

Please don’t.
Queen walks back to bed.

I guess, I’m just used to saying
I’m okay even when I’m not.

What if God wanted me to die and I
messed up His plan?
QUEEN
I don’t think that’s what He
wanted.
SLIM
How you know?
QUEEN
I just think you were meant to be

A beat.
SLIM
I’m making an executive decision.
We’re going to Cuba.
QUEEN
Executive decision? What do you
think this is “Mad Men”?
SLIM
We can’t leave here tomorrow and
not know where we’re going.
QUEEN
What about that large body of
water?

SLIM
We’ll figure it out.
Queen has never been great at letting men lead. Right now,
she doesn’t have much of a choice.
QUEEN
I’m scared.
SLIM
That’s alright. I’ll be brave
enough for both of us.
Queen lets out a sigh of relief.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Hey, why does your uncle owe you?
QUEEN
I got him out of prison once.
For what?

SLIM

QUEEN
He killed somebody.
SLIM
Damn, who’d he kill?
My mother.

QUEEN

Slim is stunned by that answer. But he knows better than to
ask a follow up question.
Slim turns off the light and turns over. Queen’s hand finds
its way to his newly shaved head. She rubs it, gently.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
I’m rubbing your head for good
luck.
SLIM
I don’t believe in luck. I think
everything is destined.
Just as they start to relax - there’s a LOUD KNOCK on the
door downstairs.

Earl opens the door to find a BLACK POLICE OFFICER standing
there. He was picked on as a child so now he spends all his
time in the gym.
UNCLE EARL
Who the fuck called you?
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I’m just here to make sure
everybody’s okay.
Earl turns to look at Naomi. Whose face is starting to
bruise.
UNCLE EARL
You still fucking this nigga?
No!

NAOMI

UNCLE EARL
Then why the fuck is he here?
NAOMI
I ain’t call him.
Earl turns to look at the Black Police Officer.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
A neighbor heard some commotion and
got concerned.
UNCLE EARL
Don’t worry. I take good care of my
property.
Do you?

BLACK POLICE OFFICER

UNCLE EARL
Oh yeah. She’s my biggest draw.
The Officer looks at the side of the house and sees the
Sheriff’s truck.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
You got a new truck?
Earl is pissed Slim didn’t park that shit in the back.
UNCLE EARL
I don’t know whose truck that is.

56.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
You mind if I come in?
UNCLE EARL
Not without a warrant, nigga.
The Officer smiles.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
When you got the proper paperwork
I’ll give you a grand tour.

The Police Officer takes a closer look at the license plate
on the truck. The Kentucky license plate gives him pause.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I think I will come back with that
warrant.
UNCLE EARL
Make sure they use the big font. I
can’t see shit.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
Keep your hands to yourself, Earl.
I don’t wanna have to come back
here again.
UNCLE EARL
I ain’t want you here no way.
The Officer looks at the license plate on the truck. Then he
takes a picture of it.

They quickly change their clothes. Slim puts on one of Earl’s

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 2

The truck that the black police officer just took a picture
of is currently ENGULFED IN FLAMES. Earl stands back and
watches it burn with glee. He likes destroying things.
Goddess hands Earl a small piece of paper.
He looks at it for a beat. Then hands it off to Queen, along
with an envelope full of cash.
Take this.

UNCLE EARL

The piece of paper has an address written on it.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
That should cover your gas for most
of the way. And the guy at that
address will take care of you. His
wife ain’t shit, but he’s cool.
The address is in Florida.
QUEEN
Johnny Shepherd? Who’s he?
UNCLE EARL
We served together. I saved his
life once. He’ll be expecting you.
And he know a guy with a plane that
can get you over that body of
water.
Queen hugs Earl as if she’ll never hug him again.
Then Earl hands Slim the keys to his BRIGHT RED CADILLAC. The
interior is ALL WHITE. It’s straight out of a blaxploitation
film.
SLIM
Thank you, Uncle Earl.

58.
UNCLE EARL
Nigga, I ain’t yo uncle!
And with that Slim gets in the car.
Queen gives Goddess a hug goodbye. Goddess holds onto her for
dear life while Earl leans down and whispers into Slim’s ear.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
Take care of her.
Then he taps the roof of the car.
UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
Love you, baby girl.
QUEEN
Love you too.
Slim backs out of the driveway carefully.

Slim and Queen speed down a dirt road.
Queen sees some CDs by her feet. Uncle Earl is old school so
he has albums by : FRANKIE BEVERLY & MAZE / THE OJAYS /
GEORGE CLINTON.
He also has albums by : TUPAC, TRU, and JOE.
She picks one up and sticks it in the player.
An old song starts to blast through the speakers. She turns
it down - not wanting to draw too much attention, but Slim
turns it back up.
He looks at her and smiles.

EXT. OPEN ROAD - DAY 3 (DAWN)

Slim and Queen drive through the bible belt. It’s a mix of
beautiful landscapes and poverty.
SLIM
It’s beautiful out here.
Then they see a bunch of PRISONERS working the land. They’re
in a long line. Moving in unison.

59.
Queen’s heart aches for the men in blue jumpsuits who mean
nothing more to this country than a pair of strong hands that
can do cheap manual labor.
Is it?

QUEEN

SLIM
I’m just tryna make conversation.
QUEEN
I’m just being honest.
SLIM
Do you have to be honest all the
time?
QUEEN
Do you want me to be silent?
SLIM
I didn’t say that.
There’s an awkward silence. Then Queen stares out the window
for a bit. She takes in the fields, the colorful sky, and the
birds chirping. He’s right. It is beautiful. But there are
still some ugly parts she can’t ignore.
Queen searches through the CDs and finds a pleasant surprise.
She shoves it in and hits play.
Queen climbs into the backseat and lays on her back. Letting
the wind blow through her long flowing wig.
SLIM (CONT'D)
What you doing?
QUEEN
I’m gon try to get some sleep.
Slim has gotten more comfortable driving the Cadillac. He
drives it like he bought it with his own money.
Queen’s eyelids become heavy. Eventually she falls asleep.
Slim watches her in the rearview mirror.
He’s never been more frustrated and enamored by anyone in his
life.

Queen is awakened by loud music. But it’s not coming from the
car stereo - it’s coming from outside.
There’s a club a few feet away in the middle of the woods. It
looks like the JOOK JOINT from THE COLOR PURPLE.
Slim pulls over and slows down.
QUEEN
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
SLIM
I heard a band playing, I wanted to
see where it was coming from.
QUEEN
We need to keep going.
SLIM
I know, but I’m exhausted. And you
in the back knocked out while I’m
tryna stay awake.
QUEEN
Fine, I’ll drive.
SLIM
When was the last time you heard
some live music?
QUEEN
I don’t know.
SLIM
We’re only a few hours from
Florida. We got time.
Queen listens to the music. Then -SLIM (CONT'D)
Would you have gone on a second
date with me?
No.
Damn.

QUEEN
SLIM

QUEEN
It’s not personal. I just like
being alone.

61.

I get it.

SLIM

QUEEN
What was the second date gonna be?
SLIM
I’m not telling you.
QUEEN
Come on. Don’t do me like that.
SLIM
Nah, you should’ve said yes.
QUEEN
Okay, fine. I’ll go.
SLIM
It’s too late now.
QUEEN
I have the right to change my mind.
Slim looks away.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Okay - I’m officially saying yes to
the second date. Now, where we
going?
SLIM
I’m taking you dancing. Let’s go.
Slim gets out of the car.
QUEEN
Can we dance once we get to where
we’re going? Just to be safe.
SLIM
I’m tired of playing it safe.
Slim extends his hand to her.
QUEEN
You’re willing to risk getting
caught just so we can dance?
Hell yeah.

SLIM

Queen isn’t convinced.

62.
SLIM (CONT'D)
One dance and we can leave. I
promise.
She refuses to budge.
SLIM (CONT'D)
I’ll buy you a drink.
And with that, she grabs his hand and we -CUT TO:

This place is so crowded the walls are sweating. This small
establishment feels like it was built during a time when
black folks still had to drink from the shitty water
fountain.
The lighting is pretty dim. And everyone is on the dance
floor grinding slow and hard to a THREE MAN BAND playing B.B.
King’s “How Blue Can You Get.”
Slim takes Queen’s hand. Startling her.
SLIM
Why you so jumpy?
QUEEN
I’m nervous.
SLIM
Ain’t nobody in here thinking ‘bout
us.
She rolls her eyes. Slim leads her to the middle of the dance
floor and pulls her in close. She shoves him away.
QUEEN
Watch your hands.
Queen slowly puts her arms around Slim’s neck. He puts his
arms around her waist, careful not to touch her ass. The
music gets louder and even more soulful as Queen and Slim
start to find their groove.
Slim looks around and realizes the prettiest girl in this
place is in his arms. He can’t help but grin from ear to ear.
Then he looks down and sees Queen has rested her head on his
chest. She’s so close she can hear his heartbeat.

63.
And right now it’s beating pretty fast. So is hers. Slim
holds Queen a little tighter. She wipes the sweat from his
brow.
As the song reaches a thunderous CRESCENDO Slim leans in for
a kiss - caught in the moment - Queen denies him.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Don’t you owe me a drink?
SLIM
What do you want?
QUEEN
Bourbon. The expensive kind.
Slim makes his way through the crowd. A few people look at
him longer than they should.
He makes it to the bar and finds a HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
slinging drinks. She recognizes Slim right away.
HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
Hey handsome!
Slim has never been referred to as handsome before.
Hi.

SLIM

He is out of his depth as he tries to pick the right alcohol.
HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
What can I get you?
Bourbon.

SLIM

She grabs a dusty bottle of bourbon from high on the shelf
and pours two shots.
SLIM (CONT'D)
I don’t drink.
HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
Maybe you should start.
He looks at her perplexed.
HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
These are on the house.
Slim grabs the drinks, but before he can leave she touches
his hand.

64.
HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
Don’t worry. You’re safe here.
They share a head nod.
Then Slim quickly grabs the drinks and goes to find Queen.
SLIM
The bartender recognized me.
QUEEN
Oh shit. We gotta go.
Slim looks around and sees nothing but friendly and
supportive faces.
Queen drinks the shot. Slim drinks his too. It burns the fuck
out of his throat. Queen pats his chest and pulls him in
close.
SLIM
I think we good.
QUEEN
I don’t know.
Trust me.

SLIM

She looks him deep in the eyes and allows herself to let go.
The band plays a slower song. It’s romantic yet rough.
Queen and Slim sway back and forth. Holding each other tight.
Burying their faces in each other’s shoulders.
Some of the crowd backs away. Watching them. Admiring them.
Rooting for them. Praying for them.
This looks like the first dance at a small wedding. Queen and
Slim look like a happy couple with their whole lives ahead of
them.
As the song comes to a close the crowd applauds the band.
Then -QUEEN
We should go.

Queen has her bare feet up on the dashboard. Slim gives her

SLIM

QUEEN
Even if they weren’t they’d still
be sitting right here.
SLIM
Nah, I would’ve stopped and got you
some gym socks or something.
QUEEN
That’s messed up.
SLIM
Honestly, I don’t think dudes even
cared about women’s feet until
Eddie Murphy made it a thing.
QUEEN
I know. But the difference is he
can be picky about a woman’s feet.
The rest of y’all need to be happy
somebody’s even laying next to yo
ass.
She can see Slim is falling asleep at the wheel again.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
You need me to drive?
SLIM
Nah, I got it.
QUEEN
No, you don’t.
I’m good.

SLIM

QUEEN
Explain something to me. Why do
dudes not like asking for help?
SLIM
It’s a sign of weakness.

QUEEN
That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever
heard.
SLIM
You say that but then turn around
and want a strong mandingo type
muthafucka.
QUEEN
I don’t want that.
SLIM
What do you want?
QUEEN
That’s a loaded question.
SLIM
We ain’t got nothing but time.
Queen leans back in her seat. She’s so far back she’s
practically lying down. Like she were at a therapy session.
QUEEN
I want a guy to show me myself.
Slim glances at her. Her legs are on full display.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
I want him to love me so deeply I’m
not afraid to show him how ugly I
can be. I want him to show me scars
I never knew I had. But I don’t
want him to make them go away - I
want him to hold my hand while I
nurse them myself - and then I want
him to cherish the bruises they
leave behind.
SLIM
Damn, no wonder you still single.
That’s a lot of shit.
She can’t help but crack a smile.
QUEEN
Maybe it is.
SLIM
But you deserve that.

67.
QUEEN
I don’t think we deserve anything
in this life. We get what we work
for. That’s it.
She watches him drive. Drinking him in.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
What do you want?
He breathes deep.
SLIM
I want somebody that’s ride or die.
QUEEN
Oh God. What does that even mean?
SLIM
I just want somebody that’s always
gon love me. No matter what. I want
someone that’s gon hold my hand and
never let it go.
He looks over at Queen. They lock eyes. She wants to look
away, but can’t.
She’s never heard someone describe love in such simple terms.
SLIM (CONT'D)
She gotta be special though - cause
she gon be my legacy.
QUEEN
What do you mean?

Queen looks around the bathroom and realizes she’s all alone
in the world.
Then - KNOCK KNOCK.
SLIM (O.S.)
You okay in there?
For the first time in her life a man’s voice reassures her
that she’s not alone.
The sound of Slim’s voice reminds her there’s a chance
everything will be okay.

Slim leans against the wall outside the bathroom door.
He watches people as they walk by. He wonders if they
recognize him. He wonders if they’re going to turn him in.
Then he spots a LITTLE BLACK GIRL walking with her MOTHER.
The Little Girl locks eyes with Slim. She gives him the stink
eye for staring at her.
Then she laughs at him. As if to taunt him for losing a
staring competition he never knew he was a part of. The
Little Girl’s sassy demeanor reminds him of Queen. This
brings a smile to his face.
As he stands there in a daze - Queen bursts out of the
bathroom. Almost as if she’s reborn.
They look at each other. Both smitten. Unsure of what the
future holds. Then - Queen extends her hand to him.
Come on.

SLIM
I don’t trust people that like
skinny Luther.
QUEEN
Skinny Luther was dope. He had a
lot more energy. He sang better.
And his clothes fit.
SLIM
You crazy as hell. Fat Luther was
the shit. Who else you know can
pull off a jheri curl and a three
piece suit at the same damn time?
She’s quiet.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Right, nobody.
As she continues to drive she sees a few HORSES grazing the
land. She immediately pulls over.
SLIM (CONT'D)
What you doing? I thought you said
no more stopping.
QUEEN
I changed my mind.

SLIM
You can’t change your mind. We

She puts her hand on his thigh.
Relax.

QUEEN

He does. She slowly gets out of the car.

Queen walks up to the horses. Judging by her demeanor she’s
more comfortable around animals than she is people.
She goes up to one and takes the horse’s nose in her hands.
She becomes one with this beautiful living creature.
SLIM
You crazy? What if it gets scared
and kicks you in the face?
QUEEN
They’re not wild.
Queen takes his hand and forces him to pet the horse. The
horse is calm and so is Slim.
It’s quiet all around them.
SLIM
How you know so much about horses?
QUEEN
My uncle used to take me horseback
riding when I was a kid.
Really?

SLIM

QUEEN
I told you he didn’t used to always
be like that.
Queen walks over to the other horse and looks in its eyes.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
He told me nothing scares a white
man more than seeing a black man on
a horse.

71.

Why?

SLIM

QUEEN
Because they have to look up at
him.
SLIM
I’ve never been on a horse.
QUEEN
You should try it sometime.
Queen starts walking back to the car. Slim doesn’t follow
her.
SLIM
Maybe I should do it right now.
QUEEN
You can do it when we have more
time. I’ll take you.
When?

SLIM

QUEEN
I don’t know.
SLIM
What if we don’t make it?
The weight of his question renders them both speechless.
We will.

QUEEN

SLIM
You don’t know that.
He’s right. She doesn’t.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Help me get on the horse.
Queen walks over to him.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Which one is the calmest?
Queen chooses the one that’s still grazing. She holds Slim’s
hand and helps HOIST him up onto the horse.

72.
The horse BUCKS at first. Then Queen whispers to the horse
and eventually the stallion calms down.
Slim is nervous at first, but eventually he relaxes. After a
moment Slim’s posture shifts. He puffs out his chest and
looks out into the world like the king he is.
Queen looks up at him. They hold each other’s gaze for a long
beat.
QUEEN
It’s nice isn’t it?
Yeah.

SLIM

Then Hey!

MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)

The horse BUCKS again. But only this time Queen can’t calm
him down. The horse knocks Slim off his back. Slim hits the
ground HARD. Getting the wind knocked out of him.
Queen helps him up and they run to the Cadillac.
They hop in the car and speed off!

Two grand?

We need it back today.
OLDER BLACK MAN
Y’all in a rush?
He looks at them suspiciously.
QUEEN

family.
OLDER BLACK MAN
Why y’all in a rush to do that?
He lets out a hearty laugh and then spits tobacco juice in a

How much mo?

Slim pulls Queen to the side.

That’s all of our money.
SLIM

That’s too risky.

You wanna give him all our money?

We just need the car fixed as soon

Slim looks up and sees the mechanic’s office. He clocks a

OLDER BLACK MAN
Cause unlike the rest of these
simple ass niggas I don’t approve
of what y’all did.
QUEEN
We didn’t do it on purpose.
OLDER BLACK MAN
It don’t matter if it was on
purpose or not. You gave them a
license to kill us.
QUEEN
That cop shot at me.
OLDER BLACK MAN
You gave ‘em an excuse.
QUEEN
You weren’t there.
OLDER BLACK MAN
No, I wasn’t. But if I was I
would’ve taken the ticket and been
on my way.
QUEEN
Can you work more and talk less?
OLDER BLACK MAN
I could work faster if y’all left
me the fuck alone.
QUEEN
I’m not leaving this car.
OLDER BLACK MAN
What if I gave you some insurance?
QUEEN
I don’t want no house keys or no
drivers license cause all that can
be replaced.
The Older mechanic walks to the garage door and knocks on it.
After a beat a SKINNY BROWN KID no more than seventeen lifts
it up. The young man looks like Barack Obama long before he
fell in love with Michelle. He wears a dirty T-shirt and
skinny jeans.
Yes, sir?

SKINNY BROWN KID

OLDER BLACK MAN
You wanna take these nice folks on

SKINNY BROWN KID (CONT'D)

OLDER BLACK MAN

SKINNY BROWN KID
I know who you are. It’s an honor

JUNIOR
There’s nothing to do around here.
People just go to work and go home.

SLIM
I know the feeling.
JUNIOR
I can’t believe y’all are here. I
was just watching you on TV and now
you’re right here next to me. Shit
is crazy.
Slim remembers what it was like to be Junior’s age. When the
weight of the world wasn’t on his shoulders and everything
was exciting.
JUNIOR (CONT'D)
I hope y’all make it.
Without knowing it Junior reminds them their days could be
numbered - and every breath should be cherished.
Me too.

SLIM

JUNIOR
Even if y’all don’t it’ll be okay.
How so?

QUEEN

JUNIOR
Cause then you’ll be immortal.
Slim walks quietly - digesting the thought.
SLIM
I like that.
Queen takes a deep breath. Drinking in her simple
surroundings. Appreciating the quiet. For once. Then -QUEEN
I’d rather live.
They finally arrive at Junior’s secret spot. It’s a small
hill with a perfect view of the sunset.
Queen, Slim, and Junior sit on the grass and marvel at the
sun as it prepares to say goodnight.
Queen looks at the purple and orange sky - then she looks at
Slim. He’s so serene. He’s made peace with whatever the
outcome will be. Junior looks up to him. Literally and
figuratively.
And for the first time in her life - she sees God.

INT. GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT - NIGHT 4

Queen and Slim get back in their newly repaired Cadillac. She
turns on the car and it hums like it just came off the
factory line.
SLIM
Yo, Junior. Can you take our
picture?
Yeah.

JUNIOR

QUEEN
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
SLIM
Come on, I want proof we were here.
This is proof Slim remembers everything. She likes that he’s
using her own logic against her.
She gives in. And they both look at Junior - ready to be
captured.
Queen has her hand on the wheel. Her toned arm on full
display. Slim leans forward. He doesn’t look at the camera he looks at her as if she were his bride to be.
Queen stares directly into the lens, the look in her eyes is
the perfect combination of fear and pride.
We linger on them long enough to realize they’re no longer
the people we met at the diner.

INT. CAR - NIGHT 4
Queen is driving. Deep in thought. Slim is fast asleep.
They drive by a sign that reads WELCOME TO GEORGIA.
Queen stares at it for a long beat. It brings back an
unwanted memory.
She makes an impulsive turn. Jolting Slim awake.

81.

Yo.

SLIM

She’s on a mission.
QUEEN
Do you mind if we make a detour?
SLIM
I do actually.
Queen doesn’t care and makes a hard left turn. She drives
down a winding road. Tears in her eyes.
You okay?

SLIM (CONT'D)

QUEEN
Not really.
He sits up and wipes the sleep out of his eyes.
Slim can tell she needs to be held in this moment, but he
doesn’t know if that’s permitted. He reaches out and touches
the small of her back. She allows it.
His hand is bigger than she realized. He rubs her back softly
at first - then he applies more pressure to help her relax
and to make sure she feels his presence in a way she hasn’t
before.
Her heart is beating so fast he can feel her body pulse. His
heartbeat syncs up with hers. They are connected.
CUT TO:
59

EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER - DAWN
Queen stares at a tombstone.
ETTA JOHNSON - BELOVED MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
Slim stands a few feet behind her. Far enough to give her
space. But close enough to let her know she’s not alone.
QUEEN
We were close when I was younger,
but when I got older I felt like I
didn’t know her anymore. She didn’t
know me either. We could go months
without talking. And when we did I hated it. I had nothing to say to
her.

82.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
She wanted a connection so badly,
but I just didn’t care. I didn’t
need her anymore.
She turns to look at Slim. Searching for judgement in his
eyes. There is none.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
I used to call her the great
pretender.
Why?

SLIM

QUEEN
She was really good at acting like
everything was okay.
Queen extends her hand to Slim. He takes it and moves in
closer.
She kneels down and pulls up a few weeds crowding her
mother’s resting place - all the while still holding onto
Slim’s hand. Queen kisses her palm and touches the cold
tombstone.
This is what closure looks like.
She lets go of Slim’s hand and makes her way back to the car.
Slim hangs back. He stares at her mother’s grave a little
longer.

INT. CAR - HOURS LATER - DAY 5

Queen and Slim sit in a parked car. Slim is in the driver’s
seat. Queen is in the passenger seat.
QUEEN
My grandma left the house to both
of them. My mom wanted to sell it.
My uncle wanted to live in it.
Typical family bullshit.
Yeah.

SLIM

QUEEN
One night they were at the house
fighting, he was really fucked up,
and he pushed her down a flight of
stairs. She cracked her skull.

83.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
She bled out so quick that by the
time the ambulance got there she
was already dead.
Slim hangs his head. Unsure of what to say.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
I had just passed the bar. I was
excited to try my first case. I
never thought that would be it.
SLIM
How could you defend the person
that killed your own mother?
QUEEN
I knew it was an accident.
SLIM
Does it ever piss you off that he’s
alive and she isn’t?
QUEEN
All the time.
Queen turns on the RADIO. We hear a journalist ON THE RADIO
reporting on a NATIONWIDE PEACEFUL RALLY in progress.
RADIO PERSONALITY
People are in support of the two
fugitives accused of killing a
police officer in cold blood.
Slim and Queen aren’t really listening to the radio. It’s
just background noise to them.
Then Slim takes Queen’s face in his reliable hands and kisses
her. It’s so pure and innocent - it’s unclear if sex will
follow.
But then he pulls her in close and kisses her again. The
second kiss is anything, but innocent. It’s the perfect
combination of lust and melancholy. Slim pulls Queen on top
of him. Rather than entering her right away - he lifts her up
to his face - her hands press up against the ceiling while he
DEVOURS her.

journalist spoke of on the radio.
He joins - A SEA OF BLACK and BROWN BODIES are MARCHING in
PROTEST. They are full of PRIDE and VENOM.
They hold up signs in support of Queen and Slim. They chant
and walk proudly.
The PROTESTORS are surrounded by POLICE OFFICERS. The
Officers are dressed in SWAT GEAR. Ready for war.
The Officers form a line. The Protestors form a line opposite
them.
The Police stand completely still like statues of oppression
in the South. The Protestors are vibrant not violent.

A BLACK POLICE OFFICER stops him from going any further. The
Officer is dressed in bullet proof gear from head to toe.
Junior is only wearing a hoodie and sweatpants to protect
him. It’s David and Goliath all over again.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
If you don’t vacate the premises
I’m gonna have to arrest you, son.
JUNIOR
I’m not your son.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
What’s your name, young man?
JUNIOR
I don’t have to tell you that.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I don’t want to hurt you. Trust me.
But it’s my job to clear the
streets. Which means you can’t be
here.
JUNIOR
I have a right to protest.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I understand that, but you don’t
have a permit. So that means you’re
breaking the law.
JUNIOR
What you gon do, kill me?
BLACK POLICE OFFICER
No, but I will arrest you.
The Police Officer LIFTS UP THE BULLETPROOF SHIELD ON HIS
HELMET - so there’s one less barrier between them.
BLACK POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
I’m begging you. Go home.

The Police Officer GRABS Junior by his arms -- in an attempt
to calm him down. But he wrestles free.
Junior pulls out a SMALL HAND GUN. He aims it at the only
part of the Officer’s body that’s not covered.
He SHOOTS him in the face. Causing the Officer’s head to

Slim rings the doorbell of a very middle class home. The

It’s safe to assume a soldier that came home with a purple
heart on his chest and a wounded heart behind it - lives
here.
The door opens. JOHNNY SHEPHERD is standing there. He is that
soldier. And he has the scars to prove it.
MR. SHEPHERD
We’ve been expecting you.
Before they walk in Slim notices a NOSEY NEIGHBOR peeking out
the window.

MRS. SHEPHERD is a college educated with views more

Mr. Shepherd has just given them a devastating update.
SLIM
What do you mean they killed him?
MRS. SHEPHERD
He shot a police officer in the
face.
Slim is shaken to his core.
SLIM
We were just with him.
MR. SHEPHERD
You knew the boy?
QUEEN
We spent some time with him.
MRS. SHEPHERD
Did you order him to do it?
Slim stands up. He wants to strangle her.
SLIM
Are you crazy?
Queen grabs his arm and tries to calm him down.

QUEEN
We would never do that.
MRS. SHEPHERD
These kids think it’s okay to kill
cops because of you.
SLIM
Who made cops think it was okay to
kill us?
QUEEN
We didn’t want this.
MRS. SHEPHERD

There’s a war going on out there
and you’ve welcomed it into our
home.

They didn’t start it.

MRS. SHEPHERD
I want them gone by morning.

We can leave right now.

I got secret hiding spots all over

The four sit at an old dining room table. This is the most

But the room is peaceful. The spread is something straight
out of the 1950s. A protein. A veggie. And mashed potatoes.
The only beverage available to drink is milk. Whole milk.

There’s a bounty on your heads.

Mr. Shepherd gets up from the table and grabs a notepad. He
WRITES DOWN AN ADDRESS and hands it to Queen.
MR. SHEPHERD (CONT'D)
Tell him I sent you.
Queen slips it in her pocket.
MRS. SHEPHERD
We should eat before it gets cold.
Everyone grabs hands and bows their heads.
MR. SHEPHERD
I’ll lead us in a prayer.
QUEEN
May I do it?
Of course.

MR. SHEPHERD

Queen takes a deep breath. She’s never done this before.
QUEEN
I’d like to start by thanking God
for the breath in my lungs. And the
breath in the lungs of everyone at
this table. I’m grateful we have a
place to sleep tonight and food to
put in our bellies. Thank you for
bringing us this far. Thank you for
this journey. No matter how it
ends.

Amen.

SLIM
Amen.
MR. SHEPHERD

Amen.

MRS. SHEPHERD

Everyone starts to eat. Queen looks up at Slim and notices
for the first time he’s not shoveling food into his mouth.
He’s not chewing like a cow. He’s taking his time and
savoring every bite. This is a change he isn’t aware of, but
she is. Queen stares at him for a long beat and smiles.

91.
Then AN AGGRESSIVE VOICE COMING FROM OUTSIDE interrupts their
peaceful dinner.
VOICE (O.S.)
The house is surrounded. Come out
with your hands up.
Mrs. Shepherd looks like she’s about to piss herself. Mr.
Shepherd is no stranger to this type of situation. He is calm
and collected.
MR. SHEPHERD
Okay, I want you two to run
upstairs and go into the yellow
bedroom on the left. Hide under the
bed.
QUEEN
They’ll find us there.
MR. SHEPHERD
There are loose panels under the
bed. Hide under there and don’t
make a sound.
Okay.
Go. Now!

QUEEN
MR. SHEPHERD

Queen and Slim run upstairs in search of the yellow bedroom.
While Mr. Shepherd quickly gets rid of Queen and Slim’s
plates to make it look like there were only two people
breaking bread instead of four.

You have three seconds to come out
or we’re coming in!

He holds one up.

while others are stuck and won’t budge. Slim starts to sweat
bullets. Queen does her best to loosen them up as fast as she
can.
They move quickly - but they aren’t fast enough.
Determined FOOTSTEPS make their way into the bedroom. The
bedroom door SWINGS OPEN. Silence.
We follow the FEET looking in the closet and then out the
window to see if they jumped.
Then we PAN UP to reveal the feet belong to the Swat Leader
that shoved a warrant in Mr. Shepherd’s face.
He stares at the bed and grins. Then he lifts it up with one
quick swoop, and -- Nothing. They aren’t there.

looks down at them.

If you tell me where they’re going

Mrs. Shepherd looks at her husband.

I’m sure they left some folks
behind to keep an eye on the house.

Queen lifts the panels up one by one. They both take in the
fresh air. They roll from up under the bed.

INT./EXT. SHEPHERD HOME - BEDROOM / BACKYARD - DAY 6

Queen walks over to the window that faces the back of the
house. All that’s back there is a GARAGE and a small
backyard. Queen lifts up the window and looks down.
It’s low enough so they can’t kill themselves, but high
enough that they could break a leg if they landed wrong.
QUEEN
We gotta jump.
Slim looks out.
SLIM
It’s too high.
QUEEN
All you have to do is bend your
knees as soon as you hit the
ground. Bend and roll.
SLIM
This ain’t no damn fire drill.
Queen climbs onto the window seal, takes a deep breath, and
JUMPS out of the window. But she doesn’t take her own advice
and forgets to bend her knees.
She hits the ground HARD and lands flat on her back knocking
the wind out of her body and her LEFT SHOULDER OUT OF ITS
SOCKET. Queen grabs her arm and rocks back and forth trying
not to scream. She’s in excruciating pain.
Fuck!

SLIM (CONT'D)

Seeing Queen in pain is the push he needed. He walks back a
few feet and runs toward the window LEAPING to the ground. He
follows Queen’s instructions and lands perfectly.
Rather than rejoicing he rushes over to Queen’s aid and pulls
her into the garage.

She continues to shake her head and backs away from him.
SLIM (CONT'D)
I think there are cops out front
and if they hear you - it’s over.
We’re done. I know how strong you
are.
Those words give her the strength she needs.

He takes it off and balls it up. She stuffs it in her mouth
and gives him a nod to let him know she’s ready.
Slim grabs her elbow with one hand and grasps her neck with

They lock eyes for a second - realizing there’s so much about

keys with him everywhere he went.
He knew better than to leave that
Acura around us.
I see why.

Slim finally finds what he’s looking for and hops in the
driver’s seat. Queen gets in the passenger. This is a far cry
from Uncle Earl’s fly caddy. But they’ll take what they can

POLICE OFFICER 1 LIFTS UP THE GARAGE DOOR.
They turn to look at him. They’re caught.
The Police Officer looks around and realizes his colleagues
are out front - chatting with each other. He looks back at
Queen and Slim and sees two faces that remind him of his own.
He remembers why he became a cop. To help people. And at the
moment, no one needs his help more than the two people in
front of him.
They have a staring contest for about three seconds.
Then he takes a few steps back and gives them room to back
up.
Slim puts the car in reverse and moves the car back slowly.
Queen sinks low into her seat.
Police Officer 1 nods his head as a way to say, “go head”.
They pull off and drive onto a SECLUDED side street.
And just like that they’re on the road again.
Police Officer 1 watches them go. Confident in his decision.
He walks back around to the front of the house.

herself up onto the window sill and leans on the roof of the

She looks up at the sky. The stars seem bigger to her. Queen

Before he flies out of the car he grabs a hold of the
rearview mirror and regains his balance.
SLIM
Fuck this, I’m coming back in.

No, you got it. You’re good. I’ll

She slows down a bit and Slim finally gets a firm hold of the

Queen picks up a little speed and Slim gets a whiff of the
freedom she just got. Slim doesn’t know if he’ll ever feel
this free again - so he cherishes the moment.

Slim gets out of the car and looks around. There’s no sign of
human life anywhere.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Will you please just get back in
the car before you get shot.
SLIM
Ain’t nobody out here.
Slim gets back in the car. They’re both exhausted from
driving all day.
SLIM (CONT'D)
I was hoping we’d pull up to a
house so we could get some sleep.
QUEEN
Well, there isn’t one.
SLIM
I can see that.

They’re gonna find us.
SLIM
No they’re not.
Queen shakes her head.
SLIM (CONT'D)
How about you get in the back and
get some sleep and I’ll sit up here
and make sure nobody kills us.
She gets out of the car and climbs in the back.
The backseat is practically a bed anyway. Slim takes off his
jacket and places it behind her head from the front seat.
Queen curls up in a ball and closes her eyes. Slim stares off
into the night. While he looks up at the stars, he hears -QUEEN
I can’t sleep.
SLIM
You want me to turn on the radio?
QUEEN
No. I want you to tell me a story.
He turns to look at her. Confused and annoyed.

SLIM
What kind of story?
QUEEN
Any story. I don’t care.
He fidgets with his hands as he begins to speak.

where babies come from. She said I
was too young to know. So I went
asked my dad. He said babies are
the product of two people that
needed something from each other. I
didn’t know what that meant. So I
said -- needed what? He said maybe
they needed to feel seen. Maybe
they needed to feel loved. Maybe
they needed to feel human.
QUEEN
And then what?
SLIM
Then I asked my grandmother and she
said -- babies come from God.
They’re His way of making sure no
one ever really dies. I remember
her saying “through our children we
are reborn.”
Queen smiles.
SLIM (CONT'D)
Then I went to my older brother and
asked him and he said, nobody
knows. You’re just born. That’s it.
Now leave me alone.
Slim chuckles at the memory.
SLIM (CONT'D)
I wasn’t satisfied with that answer
either, but I’d run out of family
members to ask - so he got the last
word.
QUEEN
So whose right?
Tears well up in Slim’s eyes. He wonders if he’ll ever see
them again.

103.
SLIM
None of ‘em. Babies come from
fucking. Plain and simple.
They both chuckle.
Then Queen’s eyelids become heavy. She eventually closes her
eyes and falls asleep.
Slim stares at her. Grinning. Watching her sleep has quickly
become one of his favorite pastimes. After a moment he finds
it hard to keep his eyes open as well.
Soon - they’re both fast asleep. In a station wagon. In the
middle of a field. Somewhere in Florida.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY 7 (DAWN)

Slim is in a deep sleep. Mouth open. Head tilted.
Then we hear - CLICK CLACK. Slim JOLTS awake.
There’s a RIFLE aimed at Slim’s face. Once his brain computes
what’s happening he scoots over into the drivers seat - this
causes Queen to wake up too.
QUEEN
What’s going on?
She looks at the man holding the rifle. He’s a BLACK MAN with
a scruffy BEARD and inquisitive eyes.
He’s wearing an oversized white t-shirt and his teeth are
covered in 14 karat GOLD grillz.
Queen and Slim aren’t sure if they should feel anxious or at
ease.
BLACK MAN
Why y’all acting all scared and
shit?
SLIM
Cause you pointing a gun at my
face?
He joyfully swings it over his shoulder.
BLACK MAN
Oh I’m just fucking wit you, playa.

104.
He opens the door on the driver’s side. Slim gets out,
cautiously.
SLIM
You know the Shepherds?
Hell yeah.

BLACK MAN

QUEEN
They were supposed to call you.
BLACK MAN
Y’all the ones that killed the cop,
right?
Slim doesn’t want to confess to this.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
I got you. Follow me.
He walks pretty fast. Queen and Slim trail behind him. Then -SLIM
How do you know the Shepherds?
BLACK MAN
From way back.
How long?

SLIM

BLACK MAN
Man, I don’t know - why you giving
me the third degree. I’m just tryna
help you.
Queen and Slim try to keep up with him.
QUEEN
They said you had a plane.
BLACK MAN
They lied about that.
Slim stops his tracks. Queen and the Thin Black Guy stop too.
SLIM
If you don’t have a plane we not
going with you.
BLACK MAN
Look man, I ain’t got that kind of
money. But I got a friend that do.

BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
He a baller. He can get whatever
you want. When we get to my trailer
Imma call him.
QUEEN
Why can’t you call him right now?
BLACK MAN
Cause I ain’t got my phone on me.
Queen looks skeptical.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
Look, y’all can either roll with me
or stand here like some dummies and
wait for the police to come get
you.

Queen and Slim sit in the Black Man’s tiny trailer. He’s
smoking a blunt while he wraps up his call.
BLACK MAN
Aight - he gon have the plane ready
to go first thing tomorrow morning.
SLIM
We can’t wait until tomorrow. We
gotta go now.
BLACK MAN
Damn, y’all some bossy muthafuckas.
SLIM
Call him back.
Slim grabs the cordless phone and hands it to him.
BLACK MAN
(on the phone)
Sorry bro, they trippin. They said
they gotta go today, nigga. That’s
what I told ‘em. Aight. Bet.
He looks at Queen and Slim and shrugs his shoulders. Then he
hangs up.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
He said meet him in a hour.

Okay cool.

Slim and Queen settle in.

Queen and Slim sit in the backseat holding hands while the
bearded Black Man drives. He rolls another blunt while he
drives. He’s great at multitasking.
BLACK MAN
Y’all wanna hit this shit?
SLIM
I don’t smoke.
Word?

BLACK MAN

BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
What about you, sis?
I’m good.

QUEEN

BLACK MAN
Shit, if I was y’all I’d be smoking
like a muthafucka.
He lights the blunt and brings it to his lips and blows out a
large cloud of smoke.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
That’s why I smoke all the time.
Shit, I’m paranoid as fuck. I
always think somebody tryna kill
me.
Who?

QUEEN

BLACK MAN
Police. Niggas. Everybody.
QUEEN
That’s no way to live.

107.
BLACK MAN
What you gon do?
That sticks to Slim’s ribs.
Yeah.

SLIM

BLACK MAN
I’m glad I met y’all, though.
He reaches out his hand for Slim to grab. They quickly dap
each other up.
SLIM
So are we, man.
BLACK MAN
Y’all really gave niggas something
to believe in.
This brings a proud grin to Slim’s face.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
We needed that. For real.
Queen reaches forward and grabs the blunt out of the Bearded
Black Man’s hand. She takes a huge hit. As she blows it out -BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
I knew you wanted to hit that shit.
They all laugh.
BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
Live yo life, sis!
Then she passes it to Slim. Nudging him to do it. He waves
her away at first.
QUEEN
Come on. For me.
That does it. Slim takes the blunt and hits it a little too
hard. They both laugh at him.
Then the Bearded Black Man looks out the window and sees a
small PLANE up ahead.
BLACK MAN
There that nigga go.

EXT. PLANE - DAY 7

It’s the kind of plane famous people get on to die. He pulls
up along side it. Queen and Slim hop out.
They both shake his hand with gratitude.
BLACK MAN
Power to the muthafucking people.
Queen grabs Slim’s hand and they both start walking toward
the plane.
It’s been a long road to this point. They’re ready to leave
it all behind. Then -They can hear HELICOPTERS floating above them. They both look
up. Fuck!
They turn around to find FIVE SQUAD CARS lined up.
TWO COPS step out of each vehicle. GUNS DRAWN.
The Bearded Black Man with the kind eyes was a Judas after
all.
One of the Police Officers gets on the bullhorn.
POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground now! Put your
hands behind your head.
Queen and Slim look at each other. Never letting go of each
other’s hand.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Get on the ground now!
QUEEN
There’s no getting out of this, is
there?
Slim says “no” with his eyes.
Queen looks up at the sky - and somehow manages to muster a
smile.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Well. I’m not letting go of your
hand.
SLIM
If I had the chance I would’ve
kissed all your scars.

109.
QUEEN
I know you would have.
Queen looks at him with tears in her eyes.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Can I be your legacy?
SLIM
You already -BOOM!
A BULLET - traveling faster than the speed of light - pierces
through Queen’s chest. Causing her body to DROP.
And just like that... a complex beauty with beautiful brown
skin and a tortured past is gone.
Slim kneels down and takes her in his arms. He stands up
holding her lifeless body.
With tears streaming down his face he walks toward the police
slowly and deliberately. The police are stunned and confused.
What the fuck is he doing?
It doesn’t matter. All we know, is his death is imminent.
POLICE OFFICER
Stop walking!
He doesn’t.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Put your hands up, now!
He doesn’t.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Stop or we’ll shoot!
He keeps walking. Defiantly.
Then -- BOOM! BOOM!
Two bullets BLOW through his chest. He plummets to the
ground. Never letting go of her.
He died just as he had lived - with pride and a quiet
dignity.
They both lay there on the pavement. In a pool of their own
blood. Their bodies making an unintentional cross.

The COPS put their guns down. Feeling powerful and guilty at
the same time. It’s an adrenaline rush they can’t describe.
The Police Officers look at Queen and Slim’s dead bodies.
Observing them. Not unlike a hunter observes his prey.

We see thousands of people glued to their TV and iPhone
screens as they watch what just took place. This is public
theater.
It’s like the OJ Simpson verdict all over again. Only this
time black people are on the losing end.
NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
Angela Johnson and Ernest Hinds
were shot and killed today by Miami
Police. The two suspects have
become quite infamous for their
ability to escape authorities after
killing a police officer four days
ago in Columbus, Ohio. Miami Police
Department released a statement
saying they hoped to arrest the
suspects so the they could have
their day in court, but they had no
choice but to open fire.
We’ll see THE SHEPHERDS watching from home. Mrs. Shepherd
watches with conflicted eyes. Mr. Shepherd has to look away.
We’ll see GODDESS and NAOMI watching on their phones in
Earl’s overcrowded house. Earl smokes a cigarette and
pretends to be unfazed. But he is. He’s never felt more alone
in the world than he does right now.
We’ll see Junior’s father watching from his shop. He doesn’t
have much space to mourn other people’s children when he’s
still mourning his own.
Finally - we’ll see the Bearded Black Man watching. He sits
in his trailer with a blunt dangling from his lips while
counting his reward money. We’ll search for remorse behind
his eyes, but we won’t find it.

The CORONER is a dignified black man with salt and pepper

He does it in a voice low enough so he won’t get in trouble,

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, mostly Black and Latino, stand in the
streets holding flowers with sad eyes. They pour into the
streets to pay their respects to two ordinary people that
became sacrificial lambs.
It’s reminiscent of BIGGIE’S funeral. Only this time there’s
no music being played from boom boxes. There’s no animation
or joy to be found.
We see Slim’s beloved father in the crowd. He bows his head
and takes off his hat as his son’s casket rolls by.
Slim’s family consists of his OLDER BROTHER, his ELEGANT
MOTHER and HIS BROTHER’S CHILDREN - two nephews and one
niece.
The only person there to grieve QUEEN is Earl. He cries
uncontrollably as he reaches out to touch her casket. It’s
covered in white hydrangeas. Her favorite.

FIVE LITTLE BLACK BOYS, run through an apartment complex.
They’re making their way to a basketball court.
As they play - we notice one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt
with Queen and Slim’s faces on it.
And just like that they’ve gone from skin and bones to
mythical beings that everyone wishes they knew.

Heroes that everyone admires and young people will emulate
for generations to come.
Whether you call them sacrificial lambs, revolutionaries or
just two innocent people that defended themselves -- their
names will live on forever.
But for the purposes of this story -- they will always be
known as Queen and Slim.
FADE TO BLACK.
