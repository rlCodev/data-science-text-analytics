INT. ELISA’S APARTMENT / RIVER FOOTAGE - NIGHT

1

We float at the bottom of a river. Surrounded by water.
Fish swim away. Debris floating in the waterAnd, then, a lamp floats byA coffee potA shoe.
GILES / NARRATOR
If I spoke about it- If I did- what
would I tell you, I wonder? Would I
tell you about the time...? It
happened a long time ago- in the
last days of a fair Prince’s
reign... Or would I tell you about
the place? A small city near the
coast but far from everything
else... Or would I tell you about
her? The princess without voice...
(beat)
Or perhaps I would just warn you of
the about the truth of these facts
and the tale of love and loss and
the monster that tried to destroy
it all...
Camera pushes and we see: An entire apartment underwater.
Objects and furniture float, gently suspended, defying
gravity.
Asleep on/above her bed -- half floating, half weighed down:
ELISA. Roughly 30, but ageless, with child-like eyes, dark,
lush hair and a thin, beautiful mouth slightly curved into a
satisfied smile.
She slowly settles/drifts down on the mattress below as an
early digital alarm clock lazily floats over a night table
nearby...
SUDDENLY: The alarm goes off!
10:45 PM
-Elisa opens her eyes. Lifts the mask, looks around: No water
at all.

2

Slowly, she gets up. An ambulance red light briefly
illuminates the apartment, its siren fading rapidly.
Barefoot, she heads to the bathroom: We see that light is
emanating from her FLOORBOARDS.
Music and dialogue leaks up through the floorboards too.
She readies the bathtub
DIALOGUE
“... No God could be pleased with
the death of a child at the
altar...”
Camera goes through floor into1B

Elisa drops
three eggs into a pot of boiling water and heads for the
bathroom. On the way there- she picks up an egg timer and
casually winds it.

INT. ELISA’S BATHROOM

She disrobes- Revealing: On both sides of her neck: two
keloid scars, diagonal and about three inches long.
DIALOGUE
“...Who’s the man?”
(beat)
Mahlon, the Judean artisan...”
The voices from below continue as she steps into the bathtub:
Water overflows and hits the tiled floor.
She sinks in. A deep sigh.
She sets the egg timer to TWO MINUTES.

3

She sighs. Then rubs her hand with soap, plants her two feet
on the base of the tub, sighs again and goes to work on
herself, gently, slowly-but with the timer ticking awayShe’s almost there when the timer DINGS.

INT. KITCHEN, ELISA’S APARTMENT - SAME

A WALL CLOCK- its minute hand slides into position- TACK!:
10:55 PM.
Elisa rips off a leaf from a wall calendar and opens a
window, letting the fresh air in. Her hair is wet and she
nervously looks at the clock on the wall.
The Calendar leaf back reads: “Time is but a river flowing
from our past.”
CLACK! 11:00 PM
Elisa stares at a WALL OF SHOES. Chooses a GREEN PAIR.
Shines them, quietly- alone- at the table. Puts them on.
Another siren goes by.
CLACK! 11:01 PM
She takes out 3 hardboiled eggs- still steaming- out of a
pot. Uses the calendar sheet to pack one, plus saltines and a
small mustard and a half pickle sandwich on a paper bag.
Two eggs and a half sandwich go onto a small plate.
She undoes the three locks on her door (light & music
intensifies still emanating from the floorboards) and4

-exits her apartment. We see the “shadowing” of old brass
letters -some are still there- they read “DELIVERIES”
She goes to the door directly across from hers (similar sign:
“PROCESSING”). A TV can be heard inside.
She uses a key to let herself in.

INT. GILES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Full of books. ENTIRELY full of them. Here and there are halffinished illustrations. Large original art from
ADVERTISEMENTS. Two cats- SNOWFLAKE and LILLIE stroll lazily.
GILES
(over sirens)
Did the sirens wake you up?
Hard at work at a drawing table- is GILES: late 60’s, refined
and prim: wool vest, bow tie and tortoiseshell glasses. When
he speaks he has a ever-so-slight stutter (which gets worse
when he gets nervous).
GILES (CONT’D)
It’s a fire. The chocolate factory.
It rained a little - not enough to
put it out... Rains are late this
year... You smell that? Toasted
cocoa. Tragedy and delight- hand in
hand...
Giles is coloring an illustration of a happy family around a
BRIGHT RED JELL-O MOLD. A sign reads: THE FUTURE IS HERE!!
On his forehead: THREE pairs of eyeglasses. He raises one and
lowers another one- grabs a brush. We see a toupee resting on
top of an acrylic paint box.
Elisa puts the eggs and carrot down on a side table. He
caresses/taps her cheek.
GILES (CONT’D)
Oh, Darling child. I’d waste away
to nothing without you looking
after me. I am the proverbial
starving artist am I not?
Shirley Temple dances on the stairs with Bojangles on “The
Little Colonel”.
GILES (CONT’D)
Oh- watch that- Bojangles- the
stair dance.
He slides his chair to see better.
GILES (CONT'D)
Will you look at that? Very hard to
do. Cagney did it- different- but
beautiful- we should watch that one
day...

5

Elisa looks at the TV. Does a few tap steps. Sirens go by.
GILES (CONT’D)
Elisa: Wake me up when you come
back. Breakfast’s on me, Child.
He goes back to his painting. Looks in the mirror and smiles.
Paints the smile on the father figure in the ad.

Both sides of the corridor are blocked by FILM CANS.
Elisa- low heeled shoes in one hand and a paper sandwich bag
in the other- moves past the cans and reaches a red door.
She exits.

EXT. ARCADE CINEMA AND TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

She stands at the top of a fire escape. A breeze blows by.
The city lights glow in the distance.
Looks at her watch: 10:55
ELISA climbs down. She exits past the ARCADE CINEMA MARQUEE.
She takes the steps in Bojangles fashion.
She takes the steps in Bojangles fashion.
The cinema owner, MR. ARZOUMANIAN, is changing the marquee
lettering for THE STORY OF RUTH, helped by an ASSISTANT.
MR. ARZOUMANIAN
Elisa- when yoo bring the rentstay for the bible moovie, eh?
Theatre’s empty...
A FIRE ENGINE SCREAMS BY- On the horizon- A couple of blocks
away: the fire: A Glowing SIGN Sputters: ANNELY’S chocolate.
A few people hurry towards the scene. Elisa crosses the
street.

Elisa looks at a shoe store window. On display on a little
rotating platform: a pair of SILVER DANCE shoes. She starts
whistling a happy tune.
Elisa dances around- and then sits down on- a bus bench in
front of an appliance store.
A CLOCK signals 11:05

On TV, over her whistle: MARTIN LUTHER KING. KENNEDY. RUSSIAN
SATELLITES. CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS on other monitors. THEN- A
WAVING AMERICAN FLAG. PROGRAMMING ENDS.
The bus arrives.

letter (B-67, C-25, etc).
A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS walks alongside a MAN IN A CANVAS

Hey- Lou- Lou! You boys mind

That’s what it’s for...

A BESPECTACLED MAN (Dr. BOB HOFFSTETLER) measures the
temperature of the water with a long, industrial thermometer.
He eyes Zelda.
ZELDA (CONT'D)
Yes. That’s what it’s for... Hard
to believe, uh?
Alright.

LOU
Alright. Sorry Zelda.

Elisa and Zelda mop and sweep around a group of workers
readying a big Filter/storage TANK of massive proportions
next to a tiled HOLDING POOL.
Roughly 20 men working at the same time.
Fleming supervises the entire operation.
The WORKERS are making a mess.
Elisa signs Zelda.
ZELDA
I don’t know Honey. I don’t know
what they’re doing.
(purposefully loud)
Mostly making a Goddam mess is what
I’d say...
Hoffstetler whispers in Fleming’s ear.

FLEMING
(dabs his nose)
Zelda, please- Watch the volume.
And, there’s no call for the
blaspheme, pleaseZELDA
Yessir, sorry, Mr. Fleming, SirFLEMING
(claps his hands)
A moment of your time- Today, we
will be receiving a new team and
asset here in T-4. This here is Dr.
Robert Hoffstetler...
Zelda and Elisa look at each other.
FLEMING (CONT’D)
I don’t want to bolster - or
overstate the matter(proud laughter)
-but this may be the most sensitive
asset ever to be housed in this
facility...
Hoffstetler looks at Elisa.
Everybody suddenly turns to attention. The sliding steel door
opens and MP’s pour inFleming thumbs them out. The door slowly slides opens andZelda and Elisa pick up their carts and- as they exit-they see a group of SPECIALISTS wheel a MASSIVE STEEL
CYLINDER into the room. It’s twice the size of an iron lung
and more elaborate.
It is escorted by 4 MP's, and a square-jawed, steely-eyed man
dressed in a black, immaculate suit and tie: RICHARD
STRICKLAND, 30’s.
In his right hand: an electric CATTLE PROD.
The CYLINDER SHAKES!! SOMETHING LARGE MOVES INSIDE!! IT
HOWLS!! A WEBBED HAND slams against the glass!!!
A WEBBED PALM HITS THE GLASS!! Elisa jumps, startled.
HOFFSTETLER
(to Fleming)
They have to leave-

ZELDA
Will you look at this?
Elisa removes dirty towels from the multiple towel racks and
puts on fresh ones. Zelda points to the urinals.
ZELDA (CONT’D)
Look- Some of the best minds in our
country- peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.
(beat)
There's pee freckles on the
ceiling!! How do they get it up
there?
ZELDA resumes mopping the checkered floor.
ZELDA (CONT’D)
Just how big a target do they need,
you figure? They get enough
practice that’s for sure. My
Brewster, no one ever called him a
great mind, even he hits the can
seventy percent of the time.
Suddenly, Strickland enters. In his hands: the cattle prod
and a plastic bag of GREEN HARD CANDY. He places them on the
sink. They start to leave, but STRICKLAND
No. No. That’s alright... Go onHe washes his hands with the precision and care of a surgeon
preparing to operate.

12

STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
You ladies seem to be chatting
enjoyably. Girl talk no doubt.
Don't mind me.
He makes eye contact with Elisa. Chews on the candy.
Methodically.
ELISA looks at the cattle prod.
STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
Look but don’t touch(beat)
That lovely dingus there is an
Alabama Howdy-do...
Strickland goes to the urinal and proceeds to piss- his handsclenched in a fist, rest on both his hips.
STRICKLAND (CONT'D)
Molded grip handle. Low-current,
High-voltage electric shock cattle
prod- That's for you to know, not
to tell.
You can hear his stream bouncing off the tile. ZELDA winces,
looks at Elisa.
STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
I’m Strickland. Security.
ZELDA
Fleming's security.
STRICKLAND
Not while I’m here.
On the stressed word, a momentary hitch in his stream.
STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
Saw you both at T-4.
ZELDA
We’re cleared, Sir.
STRICKLAND
I know. I checked.
(beat)
Doesn’t it get lonely? The
graveyard shift?
ZELDA
Gets quiet. That’s for sure.

13

She offers him a clean towel. “NO”
STRICKLAND
Man washes his hands before or
after tending to his needs. That
tells you a lot about that man.
(beat)
He does it both times? Points to a
weakness of character...
Picks up the rod. Weirdly beams at the two cleaners.
STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
Ladies? Very pleasant chatting with
you both.
Elisa notices a small drop of Red blood left behind by the
cattle prod. It lazily extends on the wet, white surface of
the sink.

The fruit on the branches was
always just out of reach...
His gaze drifts subtly to the PIE GUY at the register. He’s
manly, masculine, like a construction worker. With pie.
PIE GUY (O.S.)
Thank yeew. Y’all come back,
y’heah?
Elisa watches Giles watching the guy, his glances filled with
longing.
GILES

receded just when he stooped to
drink. And that's why we say things

That’ll be all?
GILES
For the moment.
PIE GUY
Hey- I’ve seen you in here before,

GILES
Oh, well- I- yes- I’ve been here. A
couple of times as a matter of
fact.
PIE GUY
Partial to key lime pie?
GILES
A craving I indulge in. It cannot
possibly be good for me. Nothing I
like is...
PIE GUY
Oh, no- It’s a mighty fine pie, key
lime.
GILES
And the color is so vivid!!
PIE GUY
Vivid! Now, there’s a word Ithere’s a word for ya...
GILES
A vivid word! It most certainly is.
Elisa rolls her eyes.
GILES (CONT'D)
And would you be the famous “Dixie
Doug” himself?
PIE GUY
Heck, no. Pies are trucked down
throughout the country. It's called
“franchising”, see?

PIE GUY (CONT'D)
There’s thirty-two Dixie Doug’s all
over the country.
He indicates the illuminated glass column that rotates to
display the pies. He shrugs.
PIE GUY (CONT’D)
They give us the spinners, the
signage- That there’s “Pie Boy” our
mascot. They tell us what we gotta
say— What to wear and such— there's
a manual lays it all out. They
figured out what people like,
scientifically. I don't really talk

Well, this pie is rather sordid,

GILES (CONT’D)
Well- you wanna save it- for later?
Elisa channel-surfs: EARLY CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS ON THE NEWS.
He puts the pie away in the fridge- (We see that there are
about half a dozen half-eaten multi-colored pie slices) He

MAN. Looking at her. Varied markings seems to glow and
outline its body.
Elisa’s shocked but not scared.
The bleeding creature makes direct eye contact with her.
Its EYES kick back light, like a coyote’s caught in the

She moves towards it- cautiously. The creature hisses at it

She hears a metallic noise.
Moves towards the pool
The water ripples. Chains clink. The three long chain lines
emerge from the waterline.
She sits down on the edge of the pool. She opens her lunch
box and peels an egg- slowly.
She watches the water move, finishes peeling it. She takes a
bite.

The Amphibian Man’s head emerges from the water.
They stare at each other.
He submerges towards her. The chains grow taut- they are
attached to his neck.
Then the creature is revealed in full: beautiful, Majestic.
Pure.
She extends her arm: presents another egg to him. It hissesexpanding his gills!!
She recoils. Slowly she places it on the edge of the pool.
She offers the egg, signing “egg” toward it.

ZELDA
About Ten years, Sir.
STRICKLAND
No siblings, Zelda?
No, Sir...

ZELDA

STRICKLAND
That’s not common, is it? For your

ZELDA
Momma died after me- After I was
born.
STRICKLAND
What does the “D” stand for?
Elisa and Zelda sit in front of him, like girls at the
principal’s office.
ZELDA
My “D”? Delilah, Sir- on account of
the bible.
STRICKLAND
Dee-Li-lah. . .
ZELDA
Beg your pardon?
Strickland takes a HARD GREEN CANDY from a plastic bag. Sucks
on it.
STRICKLAND
Delilah- she betrays Samson- Lulls

Arranges the pens- turns towards Elisa.
STRICKLAND (CONT’D)
The thing we keep in there, is an

ZELDA
Something offensive, Sir.
STRICKLAND

ZELDA
I wouldn’t know, Sir. What the Lord

STRICKLAND
Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a

A little more like me, I guess...
A RED PHONE rings. He picks up.

TIMMY, 8 and TAMMY, 6.
She places, in front of him, a product-placement-pictureperfect omelette.
STRICKLAND
No pancakes?
TIMMY
Dad? Guess what?
ELAINE
I’ve gone through half the boxes.
Can’t find the griddle. But I made

Strickland clumsily- painfully- eats, grunts.
TIMMY
Hey, Dad- Guess what? Guess what?

Rain. Falling on them: Giles parks the van- takes a
flashlight and goes around the van. He opens the door. Elisa
holds the Amphibian Man in her lap.
GILES
Come on. We have to go. Come on.

Elisa takes the creature to the edge of the water.
The Amphibian Man looks at the waters- murky, dark and cold
and then looks back at Giles.
Giles removes his hat and places the Amphibian Man’s hand on
his newly grown hair. The Amphibian Man takes Giles’ hand and
places it on his head. Giles smiles goodbye and walks away
with his flashlight.
The Amphibian Man lets out a quiet, heart-breaking whimper
and moves towards her.
She signs fast- “Go. Alone. Without me.”
The creature stands in the rain- streaks of it running down
his face and cheeks, like tears- so many tears.
Slowly- deliberately, he signs back at her.
Elisa cries openly. Moves to him.
-towards the water. The creature looks at her. Hesitates.
Caught between freedom and her. She turns her back.
He looks at the murky waters.
STRICKLAND has arrivedGiles turns. Strickland knocks him down in two moves.
She turns to warn the creature- tries to screamBut she is mute- A painful hiss emerges from her throat- She
tries again. Fails.
Strickland shoots twice. The Creature’s back explodes in a
cloud of blood. It falls. Distant sirens are heard now.
Elisa steps between the creature and himStrickland raises his revolver. Shoots a third time.
Elisa turns. She feels a hole in her coat. Elisa discoversalmost casually- that she has taken a bullet in her chest.
She falls next to the Amphibian Man. She turns to the
creature.
Giles picks up a broken piece of wood from the floor. Hits
Strickland.
Strickland falls.

He Loses the cattle prod.
Giles runs to Elisa, cradles her.
Strickland slowly gets up. He empties the chambers and starts
reloading the gun.
The creature- its bioluminescence markings ablaze- rises from
the ground, heads towards Strickland.
Strickland is shockedNow the chromatophores in the Amphibian Man’s body seem to
glow and get brighter.
The Amphibian Man pushes the gun away. Around his head: a
shimmering halo of bioluminescence.
STRICKLAND
Fuck- you are a God.
The Amphibian Man deploys one of his finger claws and
swiftly, calmly-he slices Strickland’s throat. Strickland falls down,
bleeding. PATROL CARS arrive.
The creature looks at Giles and then moves towards Elisa. He
embraces her tenderly: their eyes meet.
STRICKLAND, on the ground, is dies
Giles is with Elisa. The creature lifts Elisa from the ground
with infinite tenderness. She caresses his face. He caresses
her.
Policemen pour out of the cars. Zelda breaks through the
group. Moves towards Giles...
The creature stands on the edge of the pier, holding Elisa.
He jumps into the water and disappears.
The cops stand there looking at each other.
Giles moves to the edge of the pier- looks down. Zelda comes
to his side- trembling. Tears streak her face, mixing with
the rain.
ZELDA
They’re together, aren’t they?
GILES
Yes. I believe they are...

They hold hands.
GILES / NARRATOR
If I told you about it- What would
I Say? That they lived happily ever
after? I believe they did... That
they were in love- that they
remained in love? I’m sure that is
true...

UNDERWATER

Elisa and the creature sink softly, gracefully. Fish dart byOdd drifting objects... empty food cans, an alarm clock...
The creature kisses her- a kiss so gentle- and covers her
wound with his webbed palm.
GILES / NARRATOR
But when I think of her, of Elisaall that comes to mind is a poem.
Made of just a few truthful
words... Whispered by someone in
love, hundreds of years ago...
(beat)
“Unable to perceive the shape of
You, I find You all around me. Your
presence fills my eyes with Your
love, It humbles my heart, For You
are everywhere.”
He then lets her body float away from him-holding her but by the hand. Her head, crowned by a halo of
hair. She gasps! Drowning! Spasms! He holds her down! She
grows still.
And just as he releases her... the scars on the sides of
Elisa’s neck open- Revealing gills.
She opens her eyes and looks at him. Alive. He embraces her.
Blue and red lights illuminate them from above.
Camera pulls back until they become small, blurry figures
shifting in and out of focus from our field of vision...
The Shape of Water.
