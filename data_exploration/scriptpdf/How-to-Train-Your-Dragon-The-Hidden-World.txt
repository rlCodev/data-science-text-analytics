1.
FADE IN:

EXT. OPEN SEA - BARGE - NIGHT
SQ.101 - RESCUE MISSION
A creaking ship in heavy fog. A deck crammed with large
cages. Silhouettes of muzzled dragons stir within them. A
TRAPPER (IVAR THE WITLESS) walks the deck. A captive dragon
whines through its muzzle. Ivar hits the cage with his spear,
shutting it up.
Quiet!

IVAR THE WITLESS

A “CLICK” at the end of the corridor stirs Ivar’s attention.
A sword ignites, revealing an arresting figure in black,
glistening dragon armor. A helmet and visor hide his face.
IVAR THE WITLESS (CONT’D)
What are you?
The DRAGON WARRIOR (HICCUP) raises a finger to his visor.
Shhh.

HICCUP

Behind Ivar, TOOTHLESS creeps down from the top of a cage,
with glowing blue nostrils and dorsal plates, SNARLING.
Panicked, Ivar rushes toward Hiccup, trying to get past him.
Ivar jabs his spear. Hiccup hooks it in his flaming sword and
deftly disarms him, sending the spear clattering to the deck.
Ivar grabs a hanging lantern and hurls it at Hiccup. It
bounces off of his armor and hits the deck, its oil bursting
into flame. Undaunted, Hiccup steps through it, fire licking
off of his fireproof suit.
IVAR THE WITLESS
Aaaagh! You’re a demon!
HICCUP
Shhh! No, no, I’m not a demon, I’m
not a demon.
He raises his visor.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
See? Just a guy! Just a guy here to
rescue these dragons. So --

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

2.

IVAR THE WITLESS
--BUT YOU WALKED THROUGH FIRE!
HICCUP
Dragon scales! Dragons shed a lot.
IVAR THE WITLESS
No, I know a demon when I see one!
No human legs are that skinny!
SNOTLOUT (O.S.)
Think that’s a good entrance?
An explosion of flame hits the deck as a HIDEOUS ZIPPLEBACK
(HOOKFANG) lands, engulfed in fire. At it center, SNOTLOUT
stands in his saddle, dressed in ridiculous Nightmare-themed
dragon armor, his arms raised in victory.
SNOTLOUT (CONT’D)
Get a load of me!
(then, noticing his suit
has caught fire)
Ahh! AGGH!
IVAR THE WITLESS
I knew it! MORE DEMONS!
Snotlout rushes past, SCREAMING, with his rear aflame.
HICCUP
(exasperated)
No, really just a nitwit who forgot
to fireproof his butt.
SNOTLOUT
AGGHH! Hot-hot-hot!
Snotlout dives to the deck, rolling to extinguish his
smoldering posterior, right into a seeping cloud of green
gas, spreading between the cages like dry ice.
SNOTLOUT (CONT’D)
(realizing)
Guys, NO! Not yet!
CLICK. The gas erupts into a fire ball!
The dissipating smoke reveals RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, striking
dramatic poses akin to stage magicians, sloppily dressed in
Zippleback-themed armor. BARF & BELCH, their twin-headed
HIDEOUS ZIPPLEBACK, emerges behind them.
TUFFNUT
Behold your worst nightmare.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

Behold--

3.

RUFFNUT

TUFFNUT
--Along with his sister, who
insisted on coming.
RUFFNUT
That’s my intro?
HICCUP
Guys, too soon! You always come in
too soo--.
--AGGHH!

FISHLEGS

FISHLEGS crashes down between them with flared, scarab-like
wings. He rolls across the deck in heavy Gronckle-themed
dragon armor.
FISHLEGS (CONT’D)
Sorry! Still getting the hang of my
wings!
He rocks on his back like a helpless sea turtle. A baby
GRONCKLE (FISHMEAT) pops its head up from Fishlegs’ belly
pouch, GURGLING happily.
HICCUP
Fishlegs? Again with the baby? This
is a raid.
FISHLEGS
I couldn’t find a sitter!
Ivar seizes his moment and scrambles for the alarm bell.
TRAPPER
Demons everywhere!! IT’S THE END OF
THE WORL---CLANG! ASTRID lays him out with a flying side-kick, landing
in Nadder-themed dragon armor. STORMFLY, her DEADLY NADDER,
lands protectively by her side. Hiccup rounds the corner.
HICCUP
Astrid. I had him right where I
wanted him.
She flips up her visor, flashing a cheeky grin.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

4.

ASTRID
And now he’s right where I wanted
him. Let’s get to work.
They spread out toward the dragon-filled cages.
HICCUP
(hushed)
Okay, we screwed that up. But at
least nobody else knows we’re here.
AN AERIAL VIEW of the deck shows TENS OF TRAPPERS stealthily
closing in.
The rescue team sets about opening cages and approaching the
spooked dragons within. Hiccup removes the muzzle from a
nervous dragon. He calms it, offering his open hand.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Easy, girl. It’s okay. We’re gonna
get you out of here.
Fishlegs approaches a massive, antlered dragon in a cage and
squeals with glee.
FISHLEGS
A Crimson Goregutter?!
FISHMEAT and the Goregutter eye each other curiously. The
baby GURGLES excitedly, causing the giant dragon to crack a
hint of a smile.
Ruffnut rushes up to a cage, containing a tiny, round beach
ball of a dragon (a HOBGOBBLER). It watches her, nonplussed.
RUFFNUT
Hah! Look at this weirdo. Bet it’s
super dumb.
She tugs at the latch like an idiot, then slaps the bars.
RUFFNUT (CONT’D)
Ugh! Why can’t I get this cage
open?!
Astrid rushes by, lifting the pin. The cage door swings open.
It slides.

ASTRID

RUFFNUT
Psh. Obviously.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

5.

Suddenly, TRAPPERS rush toward the rescuers, closing in on
all sides.
Attack!

TRAPPER #1

HICCUP
Get the rescues out of here!
TRAPPER #2
Get that Night Fury!
The trappers attack. Hiccup swipes his flaming blade,
parrying a blow. Toothless bounds over Hiccup and takes on
several trappers at once, deflecting blows with his wings and
swiping them off of their feet with his tail.
Ruffnut and Tuffnut disarm a trapper in a bumbling one-two
and send him crashing into the bars of a cage.
TUFFNUT
No running on the deck! It’s
slippery. You could fall.
Snotlout charges past them, swinging his mace wildly.
SNOTLOUT
Step aside! Let me handle the tough
guy stuff!
His helmet gets spins on his head, masking his sight as two
trappers close in, about to strike his down...
... as Hookfang cranes over and blasts fire at them, sending
them fleeing, covered in flames. Snotlout turns his helmet
around to see them fleeing.
SNOTLOUT (CONT’D)
Yeah! That’s two for me!
A pair of trappers rush toward Fishlegs just as he ducks to
pick up Fishmeat.
One trapper swings right over his head, clocking the other
trapper square in the jaw.
Sorry!

TRAPPER

Before he can react, the Crimson Goregutter’s tail sweeps
through, sending him flying.
BACK TO HICCUP, as he’s rushed by several trappers in
succession.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

6.

He uses a cage door to deflect a blow, then yanks it back to
disarm his attacker. Toothless uses his tail to send the
trapper into the cage door, knocking him out cold.
HICCUP
Thank you. Now go get the rest,
Bud!
ASTRID is dodging blows from a spear-wielding trapper,
handily defeating them.
ASTRID
I thought this was supposed to be a
stealth mission!
HICCUP
They always start that way.
Look out!

ASTRID

She pushes Hiccup out of the way as a trapper thrusts a spear
at her. She cleaves off the head of the spear with her battle
axe. Stormfly drops in and plucks the trapper out of the
fray, dropping him overboard with a SPLASH.
ASTRID (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Thanks, Stormfly!
FROM THE MAST ABOVE, VALKA watches in her warrior armor. Her
dragon, Cloudjumper, sits perched beside her. As they take in
the mayhem unfolding below, Cloudjumper turns to Valka,
GRUMBLING.
VALKA
Oh, stop worrying. They’ll get it.
BACK ON DECK
SNOTLOUT leaps from the top of a cage with a WAR CRY, but
snags his cape on the corner, leaving him dangling helplessly
as trappers close in.
FROM THE MAST ABOVE, Valka shakes her head.
VALKA (CONT’D)
Eventually.
BACK ON DECK
HICCUP raises his visor.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

7.

HICCUP
Rescue team! Move out! We got ‘em
all!
Ruffnut and Tuffnut are encircled by trappers, all
brandishing weapons. The Twins raise their hands in
surrender. Barf and Belch suddenly pluck them out of the
fray, airlifting them to safety.
TUFFNUT
I’m gonna headlock every last one
of you! I might even leg-lock you.
HOOKFANG swoops in and grabs Snotlout from where he dangles,
flying him out of the battle.
SNOTLOUT
Amateurs! I was just getting
started!
ASTRID runs to the railing, yelling to the remaining
rescuers.
ASTRID
Clear out, guys! Go! Go!
FISHLEGS flees from pursuing trappers and dives over the
railing of the boat, seemingly into the water below. He
reappears, riding his GRONCKLE backwards.
Woohoo!

FISHLEGS

ON TOOTHLESS, rushing down a row of cages, checking for
stragglers. He senses something stirring in a locked cage. He
peers inside, curious and sniffing, but sees nothing.
HICCUP (O.S.)
Toothless! Time to go!
Toothless rushes off. Inside the cage, a piercing pair of
blue eyes open on an otherwise invisible dragon.
ON HICCUP, awaiting Toothless by the railing. He turns to
find the remaining trappers angrily surrounding him. He is
painfully outnumbered.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Oh... hey guys.
Suddenly, from behind them, trappers start flying into the
air. Toothless barrels through them like bowling pins,
rushing toward Hiccup. He scoops Hiccup onto his saddle and
takes wing, escaping into the fog...

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

8.

HICCUP (CONT’D)
Ha! You always have my back, bud.
... And leaving the battered, smoldering ship behind,
relieved of its cargo.
Ivar wearily watches them escape.
CUT TO:
EXT. OPEN SKY/BERK - DAY
SQ.201 - “Berk Overcrowded, Part 1”
PULLING through a flurry of wings -- a curtain of swirling
color...
... Unveiling Hiccup and the RESCUE TEAM returning from the
raid, leading the group of freed dragons.
Hiccup turns in the saddle, revealing bustling Berk in the
background -- a hive of activity. Literally hundreds of
dragons in movement.
HICCUP
This... is Berk! Your new home away
from home. A stunning one-stop, allexpense-paid dream destination!
They fly into the clustered, overbuilt village skyline.
Dragons are perched on every available rooftop, greeting the
arriving newbies with excitement. They take flight, following
the returning rescue party in a parade of color.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
So settle in and let your worries
melt away! The service here soars,
the cuisine’s fiery...
A dragon roasts a rack of meat for a Viking cook. The whole
hut catches fire. A Scauldron flies by and douses it with a
blast of water.
Gothi cuts across their path, wilding riding her staff like a
witch’s broom carried by terrible terrors.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
... and the locals are as colorful
as you get!
The ground is crawling with dragons of every kind. So many
that no actual ground is visible.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

9.

Vikings travel to and fro by hopping from dragon to dragon,
like a giant game of Frogger.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Any run-of-the-mill paradise boasts
beaches and sunshine. Well, not us.
We’ve got something no one else can
touch. We, my friend, have dragons!
Lots and LOTS of dragons!
They land on the dragon elevator in the center of the upper
plaza. The crowd of Vikings scatter, moving out of the way of
the new dragon arrivals. Two sheep dressed as dragons
continue grazing as the shadow of the gigantic new dragons
comes across them. They panic and run off, leaving their
dragon costumes behind.
Toothless and Hiccup hop off of the elevator and onto the
crowded plaza.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Gang, meet our latest Berkians!
“OOHS” and “AHHS” sound from the crowd. The CRIMSON
GOREGUTTER surveys his new surroundings as Berkians put their
hands out to greet it.
VIKING
Welcome to paradise, mate!
The Rescue Team lands, followed by the overwhelmed newbies.
Berkians and dragons alike surround the new dragons, giving
them a heroes’ welcome.
PHLEGMA
Aren’t you a beauty!
SNOTLOUT
Oh, you’re welcome. You’re welcome.
I took on, like a hundred trappers,
a thousand trappers.
RUFFNUT
All with burning undies.
She SNICKERS. Tuffnut pops off his helmet. Surrounding
Vikings and dragons recoil from the stench.
TUFFNUT
My thick, full beard almost caught
on fire.
He strokes his “beard,” which is actually his hair, braided
around his face.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

10.

RUFFNUT
Ugh. Just... just stop.
Snotlout saunters up to Valka, puffing his chest out.
SNOTLOUT
So, Hiccup’s Mom, any notes on my
bone-crushing assault, or was it
pretty much perfect?
VALKA
Oh, it was... indescribable. And
please, call me Valka. It has been
a year.
She walks off to inspect the newly freed dragons, leaving
Snotlout grinning from ear to ear.
SNOTLOUT
(amazed, under his breath)
First name basis.
Hiccup mashes Toothless’ cheeks.
HICCUP
I think the real hero of the day
was Toothless. Isn’t that right,
Bud? What would we do without you,
oh King of Dragons? What would we
do?
Astrid hops out of Stormfly’s saddle, rolling her neck.
ASTRID
Well, we could train a lot harder,
for one. That was pretty sloppy.
Valka looks over smiling.
VALKA
(phrasing it delicately)
Astrid does have a point. Perhaps
you all rely a little bit too much
on your dragons... and not enough
on one another.
SNOTLOUT
See, that’s exactly what I was
saying! Just listen up, guys.
Astrid rolls her eyes. Snotlout saunters up to Hiccup.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

11.

SNOTLOUT (CONT’D)
Yep, your Mom’s super impressed
with me. I’m like the son she
always wanted.
Fishmeat hops out of Fishlegs’ pouch and scurries over to the
giant Crimson Goregutter.
FISHLEGS
Fishmeat! You found a new friend!
Fishmeat dances at the Goregutter’s feet. In response, the
Goregutter pounces playfully, clumsily slamming into the
towering totem.
VIKINGS
Mind your heads!
It cracks, teeters, and collapses. Vikings HOLLER and dive
for cover. Dragons take to the air. The totem smashes into a
“bird house” structure, creating a chain effect of collapsing
buildings. The last to topple goes over the cliff.
Hiccup and Toothless cringe, as Gobber pushes through the
crowd, looking more disheveled than ever.
GOBBER
What good is having the King of
Dragons around if he can’t keep the
order?
Hiccup turns to Toothless.
HICCUP
Hey, bud? You wanna... do something
here, or...?
Toothless calls the Goregutter into line with a roar. He bows
respectfully. The baby Gronckle scurries off, intimidated.
GOBBER
And where do you suppose we put
these ones?!
HICCUP
Oh, we’ll make room.
He turns to see the beachball-sized Hobgobbler staring
blankly at him. He GASPS.
GOBBER
Ah! You brought back a Hobgobbler?!
They’re a bad omen. We’re cursed!

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

12.

Valka scoops up the Hobgobbler, looking it over
affectionately.
VALKA
Nonsense. What harm could he do?
It never takes its eyes off of Gobber.
VALKA (CONT’D)
No injuries. They’re all a little
shaken but otherwise healthy.
(to the rescues)
Now, who’s hungry?
CUT TO:
INT. BERK - GREAT HALL - MOMENTS LATER
Seq.211 - Berk Overcrowded Pt 2
THE GREAT HALL
The Berk equivalent to a crowded cafeteria. Dragons and
Vikings crammed in together, filling every space, sprawled
out on tables, hanging off of chandeliers.
Hiccup and Toothless enter last, with Gobber hobbling
alongside, exasperated.
GOBBER
Point is, you can’t keep bringing
dragons back here.
As Gobber and Hiccup make their way through the crowd of
dragons and people, SNOTLOUT runs by with his dragon.
SNOTLOUT
Come on, boy!
Hiccup and Gobber wait for them to pass, then continue
walking.
GOBBER
You’re just asking for trouble.
Hiccup throws a hand in front of Gobber, stopping him from
stepping forward. A mischievous dragon scampers past, with a
burly viking in close pursuit.
VIKING
No you don’t, you little thief!
Hiccup and Gobber wait for them to pass, then resume.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

13.

GOBBER
Those trappers are getting closer
by the day.
HICCUP
We can handle them. We have the
Alpha. Isn’t that right, Bud?
(beat)
Would you look at how happy they
are?
Gobber grumbles as they navigate the chaotic hall, dodging
Gothi as she flies by, carried by dragons. Valka is arm
wrestling the brawny Spitelout.
She wins. RACK FOCUS to reveal Snotlout watching in slackjawed awe.
SNOTLOUT
She’s... awesome.
Hiccup throws an arm around Gobber as they join the lunchline. Stew is ladled into heaping bowls and handed off to the
hungry arrivals.
HICCUP
Gobber! Relax, we did it. The
world’s first dragon-Viking utopia.
We made the dream a reality!
GOBBER
Your dream, maybe. Mine’s less
crowded and more -- AGHH!
The Hobgobbler bobs up, basking in the steaming cauldron of
stew.
Sanitary.

GOBBER (CONT'D)

HICCUP
Gobber! You’re not fooling anybody.
I know you love them.
Toothless calls the young dragon out of the stew pot with a
low growl. The newbie crawls out and slinks off, sheepishly.
Hiccup and Gobber carry their filled bowls to the head table
and squeeze in between Astrid and Valka, crushing them.
GOBBER
You’re supposed to be the
generation that leads us into the
future.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

14.

He looks around at the Gang. Tuffnut picks his teeth while
Belch steals his food. Snotlout starts a food fight with
Hookfang.
SNOTLOUT
Ha! Food fight!
Ruffnut vapidly gazes at her reflection in a tankard...
RUFFNUT
Gor-ge-ous.
... then gets hit with a turkey leg. She joins the food
fight.
RUFFNUT (CONT’D)
Watch the hair!
All the while, Fishlegs feeds Fishmeat in a highchair, making
dragon sounds as he flies in a spoonful of stew to its open
mouth.
FISHLEGS
Good Fishmeat! On-nom-nom-nom.
Gobber gets hit with a lump of food. He wipes it off,
glowering.
GOBBER
Ugh. Thor help us.
He grabs Astrid and Hiccup, pulling them together in a
headlock.
GOBBER (CONT’D)
Time to stop worrying about
problems out there and start
sorting out the ones right here.
Gobber...

ASTRID

HICCUP
(squeezed under his arm)
Okay, okay, I’ll think about it.
GOBBER
Hang up those saddles and get
married.
A pregnant pause. The GANG gawk at the mention of marriage.
TUFFNUT
The “M” word.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

15.

RUFFNUT
Gross.
(beat)
Unless it’s me.
GOBBER
Start ruling like a proper royal
couple.
Hiccup grimaces, his face pressed into Gobber’s armpit.
Gobber whispers into Astrid’s ear.
GOBBER (CONT’D)
Marry him, please. You’re the only
one with any sense around here.
With you wearing the pants, there’s
still hope.
Astrid peels away, awkwardly recoiling at the proposition.
ASTRID
Wow! Not awkward at all. Thanks for
that, Gobber!
GOBBER
Astrid... don’t be like that!
Hiccup pops his head out of Gobber’s armpit, GASPING for air.
Tuffnut comes up behind Hiccup.
TUFFNUT
Whoa. That is a definitive no.
Look, if you need a beard to cry
on, just lean on my shoulder and
you can cry into my full, thick
beard.
He pulls Hiccup’s face into his filthy “beard.”
HICCUP
(muffled)
Oh, thank you, Tuffnut. Thank
you... so much.
Eret approaches and coughs awkwardly as Tuffnut clutches
Hiccup in his beard.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
(muffled)
Eret, son of Eret! What’s the
report?

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

16.

ERET
Two more trapper barges spotted in
the strait.
HICCUP
(optimistic)
So we go after them!
Hiccup turns to Gobber, leering back, judgmentally.
What?

HICCUP (CONT’D)

GOBBER
One day, you’re going to pick a
fight you can’t win.
Hiccup grimaces back.
CUT TO:
EXT. MILITARY BASE - DAY
SQ.221 - Grimmel’s Deal
A FLYING P.O.V
... soars over a congested harbor, cluttered with warships. A
reflection in the passing water below reveals the source -- a
bizarre, quad-armed airship, flown by four red-bellied
dragons.
A pair of dragon scouts lead the way, speeding over sprawling
network of wooden docks toward a bustling military base.
Smoke hangs in the air, billowing from blacksmith chimneys.
Store houses and barracks weave toward a hilltop arena, built
within the ruins of a Stonehenge-like druidic circle.
The airship hovers to a landing atop the hill, scattering
slack-jawed soldiers. The dragons HISS, commanding a wide
berth. These DEATHGRIPPERS are monstrous brutes, bulging with
armored back plates and blood-red underbellies. In place of
front legs, they scuttle on bulky, serrated pincers.
GRIMMEL, 55, descends from the cockpit, tall, slender, and
dressed head to toe in black, scaly leather.
Grimmel enters a stone archway, flanked by his pair of
Deathgripper scouts. Soldiers watch him keenly, hands
gripping their sword hilts. Archers above follow his every
move, bows drawn, as they whisper a warning to each other.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

17.

ARCHER
Deathgrippers.
Grimmel and his pair of Deathgrippers disappear into the
tunnel leading us into...
AN ENORMOUS ARENA
... The size of the Colosseum. Sooty stone walls rise
imposingly from a scorched dirt floor. A spider web-like dome
of steel forms an impenetrable ceiling.
Along its walls, a small collection of dragons lay stuffed
into undersized cages, while at the center of the arena, an
enormous dragon is tethered in place. SOLDIERS brandishing
shields and spears poke at the unruly beast. It ROARS through
muzzled jaws and thrashes its club tail in retaliation,
swiping soldiers off of their feet.
The pair of Deathgrippers emerge from the tunnel into the
arena. They HISS, eyeing the captive dragons. Tusks extend
from their heavy jaws. The training ring mayhem turns eerily
quiet. The captive dragons shiver and shrink to backs of
their cages as the Deathgrippers pass. The unruly large
dragon at the center grows still, averting its eyes from the
stalking predators.
ON A NEARBY DAIS
A trio of WARLORDS (two males, one female) in unblemished,
decorative armor, hover over a map. Ivar The Witless (from
the opening scene) positions a small ship upon the table.
IVAR
The dragon riders attacked us here,
off the Eastern Strait.
RAGNAR THE ROCK drives another boat piece into it, mouthing a
CRASH. The others glare at him.
Ragnar.

CHAGHATAI KHAN

He stifles his amusement.
Uh. Sorry.

RAGNAR THE ROCK

GRIMMEL (O.S.)
My dear warlords.
They part to reveal Grimmel behind them, grinning as he peels
back his hood, exposing a shock of white hair.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

18.

GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
How go your plans to conquer the
world?
Ragnar goes to embrace him with open arms.
RAGNAR
Ha! Grimmel! My old friend! Thank
you for coming-A Deathgripper pins him to ground. He YELPS. Grimmel looks
around, nonchalantly.
GRIMMEL
A year since Drago’s defeat and no
further along with your dragon
army, I see.
Griselda The Grevious glares, sourly.
GRISELDA THE GREVIOUS
You can thank the young chief of
Berk for that.
GRIMMEL
Stoick’s boy?
Ragnar peeks out, still pinned under the Deathgripper.
RAGNAR
(straining under the
weight of the dragon)
He and his peace-loving dragon
riders continue to raid our ships
and steal our dragons.
GRIMMEL
Hmph. That does sound like a
nuisance. But I’m in the business
of killing dragons, not retrieving
them.
He turns to leave, signaling the Deathgripper to follow.
Ragnar sits up, catching his breath.
RAGNAR
But, Grimmel...
GRIMMEL
The idiot boy has done all of the
work for you, gathering the dragons
in one place. Why bother me?

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

19.

CHAGHATAI
Because the flock is protected by a
Night Fury.
Grimmel stop in his tracks.
GRIMMEL
Not possible.
CHAGHATAI
It seems one slipped through your
fingers.
He glares, but Ragnar gets between them, forcing a smile.
RAGNAR
Look, Berk’s dragons will follow
their alpha, so we’ll pay you to
capture him and bring the flock to
us.
Grimmel considers the proposition. In the background, his
Deathgrippers antagonize the retrained Rumblehorn, nipping at
it while it thrashes against its chains.
RAGNAR (CONT’D)
(sweetening the deal)
We even have your favorite bait.
CHAGHATAI
The only dragon they left us from
last night’s raid.
They gesture to a nearby cage. A white dragon lies curled up
by the back bars. Grimmel approaches.
GRIMMEL
A female? Hmmm.
RAGNAR
So do we have a deal? Old friend?
Suddenly, the Rumblehorn breaks free and charges for the
exit, directly in the path of Grimmel and the warlords. They
scatter, but Grimmel stands his ground, effortlessly firing
his crossbow and bringing it down.
GRIMMEL
When all is said and done, this
young chief will bring me the Night
Fury.
In the resulting dust cloud, Grimmel pulls his foot from
under its snoring snout. Grimmel turns with a smile.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

20.

GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
They don’t have a leader. Just a
boy.
He walks off.
CUT TO:
EXT. BERK - LOOKOUT - SUNSET
SQ.251 - FLASHBACK #1 - “Our Home”
CLOSE ON
A wide-eyed boy, 5, with rosy cheeks and a scar on his chin.
He stares ahead, wind buffeting his hair.
STOICK (O.S.)
Hiccup. This is Berk, son. It’s our
home.
PULL BACK to reveal YOUNG HICCUP in STOICK’S arms. They’re
standing on a high lookout, taking in the village with its
defense towers and catapults.
STOICK (CONT’D)
It was the home of your
grandparents, and their
grandparents before them. It’s my
job as chief to protect us, Hiccup.
And one day, when you’re all grown
up, that job will be passed onto
you.
HICCUP
(awed whisper)
Okay.
Stoick points to the setting sun on the open sea.
STOICK
It’s very important, son,
because... out there, beyond the
sunset, lies the home of the
dragons.
Hiccup looks up at Stoick in awe.
Wow.

HICCUP

STOICK
Aye. Legends tell of ships that
sailed too close to it, only to
drop off the edge of the world,
never to be seen again.
(beat)
But those sailors who turned back
told tales of a great waterfall and
dragons guarding the entrance to a
Hidden World.
Whoa.

HICCUP

STOICK
Not just a nest, Hiccup, but a land
from which all dragons come.
HICCUP
Even... Night Furies?
Stoick smiles.
STOICK
Especially Night Furies.
HICCUP
Those are scary.
Hiccup turns back to the sunset, gawking in amazement.
STOICK
Don’t you worry. One day, I’ll find
the Hidden World and seal it up, so
that people and dragons will fight
no more.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BERK - CLIFFTOP - SUNSET

CLOSE ON Hiccup, staring into the sunset, brow furrowed, his
hair buffeted in the wind.
Toothless shuffles up, WHIMPERING.
What?

HICCUP

Toothless responds with a cute, pleading stare.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

22.

HICCUP (CONT’D)
Oh, all right.
He reaches down and unbuckles his prothetic leg.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
You do know, it’s not a chew toy,
don’t you?
Toothless gets into a dog-like play position -- crouched down
on his forelegs with his rear in the air. He dances around
excitedly.
Hiccup holds up the leg, waving it tauntingly.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Is this what you want? Oh, do you
want this leg? Do you want my leg?
He tosses it over the cliff.
Go get it!

HICCUP (CONT’D)

Toothless bounds after it, leaping off of the cliff, and
gliding wobbly after the leg as it plummets. He nabs it in
his jaws and throws open his wings, rising again.
Hiccup smiles, then removes his map, unfolding it as he bends
to his knees. He studies the archipelago, biting his lip.
Suddenly, his prosthetic leg drops onto the map, bouncing and
splattering slobber over the parchment.
He glances up to Toothless, riding the updraft with a locked,
flared mechanical tail.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Getting pretty good at gliding on
your own, Bud.
Toothless lands, panting happily. He nudges the prosthetic
leg closer, as Hiccup tries to concentrate.
Suddenly, Stormfly bursts into view, blotting out Hiccup’s
view of the sunset. She hovers above Hiccup, grinning.
ASTRID
(projected)
Oh, so this is where you come to
get away from Gobber?
Hiccup CHUCKLES.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

23.

HICCUP
I have no idea what you’re talking
about.
She hops off of Stormfly, smiling knowingly. Toothless rushes
to her with the slobbery prosthetic leg.
Ewww.

ASTRID

She takes it and lobs it over the cliff. Toothless bounds
after it. Astrid wipes her hands on Hiccup’s shoulder in
passing and plops down at the edge of the cliff, dangling her
legs off of it.
ASTRID (CONT’D)
Well, he’s right, you know.
Hiccup lights up, a goofy smile on his face.
HICCUP
Really? You think you and I
should...
ASTRID
Oh, gods no. We’re nowhere near
ready for that.
Hiccup grimaces, hiding his hurt.
HICCUP
No, that-that’s crazy...
ASTRID
I mean he’s right about all of
this.
She gestures to the village below. Hiccup SIGHS.
HICCUP
It does seem like the whole world
knows about us now.
ASTRID
Yup. And the more dragons we bring
back here, the bigger of a target
we become.
Toothless drops the prosthetic leg on her lap. She tosses it
again and he dives after it, happily.
ASTRID (CONT’D)
I just wish there was some way to
make them leave us alone.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

24.

HICCUP
There might be.
She twists around, meeting his eyes, quizzically.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Dad used to talk about an old
mariners’ myth, of a secret land at
the edge of the world where dragons
live totally out of reach.
Astrid CHUCKLES, dismissive.
ASTRID
Well, sailors are known for tall
tales.
HICCUP
True. But what if it’s real? It
could be the answer to all of our
problems.
ASTRID
How? By moving the dragons there?
Hiccup shakes his head.
HICCUP
Uh uh. All of us.
She stares, incredulous.
ASTRID
Seriously. And abandon our home of
seven generations? The home your
father left you to protect?
Pregnant pause. Hiccup shrugs and stammers.
ASTRID (CONT’D)
Yeah, I think we need a real
solution, Hiccup.
Toothless lands and begins gnawing on the leg. Stormfly
hovers, eyeing it, jealous.
HICCUP
(lightening the mood)
Well, we could just take Gobber’s
advice and tie the knot. That
should fix everything.
She rolls her eyes at him.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

HICCUP (CONT’D)
(playfully)
But hey... if you’re having doubts
about yours truly, I’m pretty sure
Snotlout’s available.
ASTRID
He only has eyes for your Mom.
Hiccup GASPS in mock insult and pulls her into a bearhug.
HICCUP
Oh, you’re playing dirty now, huh?
ASTRID
(laughing)
You asked for it! Looks like there
might be a wedding after all!
HICCUP
(struggling)
How dare you! That is a low blow.
No, no, you’re not getting away...
She grabs his arm and twists it behind his back.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Aghh! Okay, okay! You win! You win!
You always win.
She GIGGLES and settles into an embrace.
ASTRID
You knew what you were getting
into.
HICCUP
Uh huh. Right.
IN THE BACKGROUND, Toothless’ ear plates perk up. He drops
the prosthetic leg and raises his head, twitching his ears.
He gets to his feet and shuffles to the edge of the cliff,
staring off into the forest below. Hiccup turns toward him.
Uh, Bud?

HICCUP (CONT’D)

Toothless suddenly bounds off of the cliff, gliding and
bounding into the distance.
Hiccup gets up and hops to the edge of the cliff.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

Yeah, sure, don’t bother to wait

Toothless continues into the distance, without looking back.
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
SQ. 401 - LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
Toothless weaves between trunks, following a distant MOANING.
Drips from the past rainstorm patter all around. Mist
blankets the forest floor. Twigs snap under his weight.
Suddenly, the mournful call ceases. Toothless sniffs the air
and pushes his snout through the underbrush. His glistening
eyes widen in amazement.
Ahead, in a small clearing, a shape shifts in the dappled
moonlight. Its body shimmers in beads of rainwater, plunged
back into mystery as shadows consume it.
Toothless GURGLES.
The groggy dragon (the Light Fury) slowly raises its head.
Details reveal themselves slowly -- a sleek and smooth
creature, with long folded wings, feline features, and -even in the dark -- iridescent scales of pure white.
Toothless watches, mesmerized as...
FROM TOOTHLESS’ P.O.V.:
In SLOW MOTION, the white dragon slowly turns to face him,
giving us our first real look at her. Piercing blue eyes lock
upon him. Her head is smooth and elegant -- strikingly
similar to a Night Fury, but lacking Toothless’ crown. Two
stubby ear plates lay folded back.
ON TOOTHLESS, awestruck, babbling in SLOW MOTION. He takes a
cautious step forward.
She recoils and yowls back: “Get out of here. It’s a trap.”
She snarls at the ground between them. Toothless stops in his
tracks, looks down at the area, and steps around it, giving
it a wide berth. He comes within a couple of feet of her.
His lips crackle apart into a big, reassuring smile. He coos:
“It’s okay.”

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

27.

Toothless inches closer. Her grogginess fades, her
guardedness subsides. They hold the stare. For a moment,
there is only the sound of their purrs, falling into sync.
SNAP. A twig breaks. She stirs from the stare and jolts her
head to the right, spotting Hiccup and then Astrid pushing
through the brush. She jumps back, alarmed.
ON HICCUP AND ASTRID, gaping in amazement.
HICCUP
Oh my gods.
Hiccup!

ASTRID

The white dragon blasts! Hiccup and Astrid dive out of the
way. The violet fireball hits the tree trunk between them,
shattering it and bringing down the top in a thunderous
crash.
Toothless balks: “Stop!” She turns to him, confused, and
swallows the blast. She balks back: “But they’re humans!”
Hiccup and Astrid raise their heads from the underbrush,
covered in splinters and looking startled.
HICCUP
Yeah, yeah we’re friends! No need
to kill us!
Spooked, the white dragon lunges into the air, crashing
through the tree tops in a rainfall of branches and pine
needles.
Toothless cries out: “No! Come back!” He bounds up a tree
trunk to the top in pursuit.
But it’s no use. She looks back one last time, then blasts a
fireball and flies through it, pulling a comet trail of
flame. When it tapers to nothing, the dragon is gone,
vanishing into thin air.
Hiccup and Astrid gape, astounded.
Wow.

HICCUP (CONT’D)

ASTRID
Another Night Fury.
Astrid smiles, thoroughly amazed.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

HICCUP
No, not quite. It’s more like a...
HICCUP (CONT’D)

Light Fury.

HICCUP
Yeah. Yours is better, probably.

crestfallen.

The cave is a flurry of activity. Astrid and the Gang are
busy at work, feeding dragons, cleaning stalls. Ruffnut
watches Toothless, who is still staring dumbstruck into the
distance.
SNOTLOUT
What do you mean, “gone?”
HICCUP
Vanished, into thin air.
Hiccup is seated at a stool, carefully removing a splinter
from a Gronckle’s foot.
Fishlegs bounces over with the baby Gronckle in his backpack,
showing Hiccup a new dragon card he’s been working on.
FISHLEGS
What do you think?
HICCUP
Uh-uh. Stubbier ears. No dorsal
plates.
FISHLEGS
Okay, got it.
Fishlegs nods and makes a few adjustments as Eret walks past,
hauling a bundle of fresh hay into a clean stall.

ERET
What a night!
Toothless nudges Hiccup, growing ever more impatient.
HICCUP
Bud, what’s gotten into you? What
is all this slobbering and panting?
Astrid rubs Toothless’ muzzle playfully.
ASTRID
Isn’t it obvious? He’s in love!
HICCUP
(privately, to Toothless)
Trust me. Relationships are nothing
but pain and misery.
Astrid punches him. He recoils and gestures at Astrid, saying
to Toothless:
HICCUP (CONT’D)
What did I just say?
Toothless resumes prancing around, unfazed.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Am I not enough?
Toothless stares blankly, frothing and panting, then bolts
away.
TUFFNUT
I think that’s a no.
Toothless spots a pair of Nadders enacting a courtship
display. He wanders over, curious, as Fishlegs appears at
Hiccup’s side with the revised card. It’s a mess of smudged
pencil lines.
FISHLEGS
Something like this?
HICCUP
(exasperated)
You know what? Just trace your
Toothless card and make her white.
FISHLEGS
You could’ve led with that.
Fishlegs nods, hobbling away.

Can you believe it? Toothless has a

HICCUP
I never took you for a romantic.
Like, ever.
ASTRID
But it’s so sweet. I mean... look.
She gestures to Toothless, now privately practicing the
Nadders’ courtship display with his own shadow. He extends
his wings and throws his head back, CLUCKING awkwardly.
TUFFNUT
Okay. That’s just sad. And weird.
RUFFNUT
Yeah, you better do something.
SNOTLOUT
Seriously. I’d rather shovel poop
all day than watch that.
Hiccup SIGHS. Pulls the splinter form the dragon’s foot and
set it down.
HICCUP
All right, let’s head back to the
woods and see if we can find her.
Toothless bounds over excitedly, smothering Hiccup in licks.
Tuffnut sets down his broom and joins.
TUFFNUT
Ah, good idea. A little privacy.
Uh...

TUFFNUT
Shhh.

focused.
HICCUP
Uh, no, actually.
Tuffnut swings a stick at the underbrush.
TUFFNUT
Good news -- I’ve been to two
weddings, crashed both. But none as

Look we talked about it. We’re not

You’re really bad at pep talks.

Stop letting these insecurities get

It’ll be hard, but you have my
word. And until I break that word,
I won’t give up.
Hiccup spots something glimmering in the brush at the far end
of the clearing. He approaches, curious.
TUFFNUT (CONT’D)
Hey. Hey! What, am I wasting my
time here?! You see some shiny
thing in the woods -- ooh, what is
that?
Hiccup reaches down and retrieves a discarded dart containing
a glass vial. Hiccup furrows his brow, studying it. A single
drop of green fluid drips from the end of the barb.
He whips around to see Toothless sniffing leaves and pine
needles near the center of the clearing.
HICCUP

Toothless recoils in response, eyeing Hiccup, confused.
Hiccup holds up a hand.

Hiccup glances around the clearing, spotting an undisturbed
area at the center of it. He reaches for Tuffnut’s walking
stick and hurls it like a spear into the center.
Hey!

TUFFNUT

It sticks its landing, then... CLANG! In an EXPLOSION of
debris, two giant iron jaws SNAP SHUT in the air like a giant
bear trap, obliterating the stick that triggered it.
Hiccup leaps backward as the trap rings out into the forest.

It ruined boy talk!
Tuffnut tosses the dart, nearly stabbing Eret.
GOBBER

Yeah, I wouldn’t advise taking
Toothless anywhere, Chief. I know

Famous back where I’m from.
Smartest dragon hunter I ever met -well, next to me, of course.
HICCUP
Can’t be that smart. He left his
trap unmanned.
ERET
Nothing’s accidental when it comes
to Old Grimmel. He lives for the
hunt. To get inside the mind of his
prey, to control its every choice.
It’s all a game to him.
Hiccup glances at Toothless, eyeing the sky, lovesick.

Well, he doesn’t know who he’s
playing with.

Yeah, and we’ve dealt with his kind

Alright, come on, give me a clue

He looks up -- Toothless is snoring in a shadowy corner of
the room.
He hears a creak. Turns to the door. Nothing. He watches it
for a moment, then return his gaze to the book on his lap.
He hears a gurgle -- water pouring from a jug into a cup.
Hiccup jumps to his feet, alarmed. The sound of SLURPING
follows.
GRIMMEL
Oh, I hope you don’t mind if I help
myself? Mmm. This is quite good.
Hiccup extends and lights his Dragon Blade, illuminating a
figure standing in the shadows of his kitchen -- tall and
lean, covered head to toe in black leather. Grimmel sips
calmly.
HICCUP
That is impressive. But let me
finish my drink.
Toothless stirs. In a flash, Grimmel immediately fires a dart
from his crossbow, putting him out with a YELP.
Toothless!

Hiccup rushes over to Toothless as Grimmel tosses his cup on
the floor and reloads his crossbow, aiming it at Hiccup where
he stands.

What did you do to him?
GRIMMEL
Ehh. Nothing that he won’t sleep
off.
He crosses the room, crossbow in hand, and sits in Stoick’s

You have no idea who I am, do you?

Well, your father knew of me. Now
there was a chief! One of the
greatest dragon hunters to have
ever lived.

What would he think of you?
Grimmel CHUCKLES.

He had it right, you know, making
it his mission to destroy the
beasts so that you could grow up in
a better world.
HICCUP
He changed his mind.
GRIMMEL
And look where that got him.
Hiccup glares at the spiteful jab.
GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
So, let’s get to the point. I am
the Night Fury killer. I’ve hunted
every last one but yours. You are
going to give me that dragon, or HICCUP
I will never give him up.
Grimmel rises from his chair, laughing as he pushes Hiccup’s
Dragon Blade aside. He struts past Hiccup, toward Toothless.
GRIMMEL
You wish dragons to live free,
among us, like equals? A toxic
notion, my boy. History has shown
that we are the superior species.
What if word of your misguided
ideas were to spread?

revealing Fishlegs in disguise.
FISHLEGS

Did we get him?
Hiccup hooks Grimmel’s crossbow with the tip of his Dragon
Blade and casts it aside.
Now!

HICCUP

Suddenly, Valka, Astrid, and Gobber rush out of hiding,
leaping from the loft above and bursting through the door.
GOBBER
Sorry to barge in!
Grimmel looks around, surrounded.
HICCUP
You think you can come into my

This is Berk. And we have defended
our way of life from far worse than

Grimmel smiles.
GRIMMEL
Ooh, a fighting spirit! I love it.
Only, I’m afraid you’re mistaken.
You’ve never seen anything like me.
He whistles, summoning his Deathgrippers.
In response, serrated pincers puncture and tear through the

Gobber pulls Fishlegs out of harm’s way as flaming ceiling
timbers collapse, nearly crushing them. Everyone dives for
cover in the inferno.
GRIMMEL
Have my dragon ready when I
return... or I will destroy

We’re Vikings! We don’t run from a

(accusingly, to Eret)
You might.
Eret throws him a baffled glare.

I agree with Hiccup. We haven’t
seen the last of Grimmel. He’s a

I’m with Eret. We have to take this
threat seriously.
She nods to Eret. RACK FOCUS to Snotlout, fuming.

SQ. 1091 - The Quest Gone West
The entire Berkian flock of dragons cruises through a
glorious cloudscape of towering cumulous skyscrapers, hauling
their riders and everything they can carry -- including an
entire Viking ship loaded with supplies, and one loaded with
sheep, dressed in dragon costumes. One of them exchanges a
nervous look with a passing Monstrous Nightmare.
Hiccup is at the head of the pack. A flurry of dragons and
riders follow him into the distance, over miles of endless
sea, toward a late, setting sun. The horizon is gleaming and
bright, filled with promise.
The crowd of dragons and their riders are parted by Fishlegs,
who uncomfortably makes his way through the crowd with the
screaming baby Gronckle on his back.
FISHLEGS
Ah, excuse me, coming through...let
me just get right through here.
Fishmeat look! Eat your rocks, eat

Fishmeat burps up a slug of molten lava, barely missing

Gobber pushes through the front line of the formation, past
Valka and Astrid, toward Hiccup. He eyes the horizon, then
turns to Hiccup.

Toothless BABBLES back, perplexed, looking to the clouds
above, narrowing his eyes. Hiccup and the Gang follow his
stare.
Above in the distance, a shape pierces a cloud, pulling a
wispy trail in its wake. A gleaming, warbling, mirror-like
form darts between the rounded formations, reflecting the
golden cloudscape. As it cruises through the sky, an
iridescent white dragon materializes out of thin air.
Toothless EXCLAIMS, excitedly.
ASTRID
The Light Fury!
VALKA
She’s following us!
The Light Fury blasts a fireball ahead of her and flies
through it, pulling a comet trail of flame and smoke. When it
dissipates, she’s gone, having vanished anew.
The crowd “OOHs” and “AWWs,” slack-jawed faces grinning in
amazement.
GOBBER
Would you look at that?
TUFFNUT
Where’d she go? Is she made of sky?
Elated, Toothless jackknifes upward, giving chase and CALLING
out to her.
HICCUP
Whoa! Hold up, Toothless!
The Light Fury’s warbling shape proves hard to track as her
cloaking ability renders her nearly invisible. Toothless
zigzags through the air, leaving the flock far below,
determined not to lose her again.
She punctures a towering cumulous and explodes out of the
top, corkscrewing through the air and pulling wisps. She rematerializes at the top of her arc, suspended weightless in
the air. Toothless GURGLES, enamored.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Well, look who it is!
She SNARLS and suddenly dive-bombs them. Hiccup’s smile fades
as she closes in.
She swoops in and attacks Hiccup!

flailing in her clutches...
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Oh hey, it’s really nice to finally

... and in one dismissive gesture, she hurls him out like the
trash. Hiccup tumbles head over feet, plunging toward the
sea.
The Light Fury turns back to Toothless, GURGLING with a
gaping, self-satisfied smile: “There! You’re free.”
Toothless looks toward Hiccup, now a plummeting speck. He
turns back to the Light Fury, offers a forced smile: “Thanks,
but, uh...” and dives to Hiccup’s rescue, his locked tail
encumbering his normal grace.
The Light Fury watches, confused and a little insulted.
Hiccup plunges past the flock, grimacing in humiliation.
SNOTLOUT
This is perfect. So great.
Toothless dives after him, collecting him back in the saddle.
He preempts their snarky comments.
HICCUP

The group snickers.
They arc back into the sky, rejoining the flock, as Toothless
searches for any sign of the Light Fury. Alas, she’s gone.

It’s delusional.

He turns to Astrid as she strokes Stormfly affectionately and
sets about unpacking her saddle.
HICCUP
Do you still think I’m crazy,
or...?
ASTRID
Let’s just say this whole idea is

Hiccup smiles.
HICCUP
Well, thanks for supporting me last

She pulls Stoick’s notebook from a crate and hands it to

Hiccup has fallen asleep, book on his chest. Toothless
slumbers beside him, gnawing the prosthetic leg. Suddenly,
Toothless awakens, stirred by some unheard sound, and knocks
Hiccup off the bed.
HICCUP
(still half-asleep)
Toothless, no, it’s too early...
Toothless raises his head and twitches his ear plates,
following the sound of soft, stealthy patters of feet moving
through the camp. The sound of sniffing grows closer.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

53.

A moonlit shadow appears on the canvas tent wall, cutting the
silhouette of the Light Fury.
Toothless’ eyes flare excitedly and he quickly slips out of
the tent flaps... only to find no one there.
Between a pair of tents, a dragon outline warbles in the
moonlight like a fun-house mirror in movement. It stops,
aware of Toothless’ presence. The mirror effect dissipates as
the Light Fury’s scales cool down, leaving the two dragons
staring face to face.
Toothless rushes toward her, excited, but she utters a snarl,
stopping him in his tracks with a “Hush, you’ll wake them.”
He holds his pose. She slips off between the tents,
disappearing from view and he follows.
He trots after her, between the tents and palettes of
supplies. She lures him away, disappearing, then reappearing.
As she weaves through the camp, their movements fall in sync,
like a kind of dance.
She leads him into the pasture beyond the camp. The moonlight
plays upon her sleek body, glimmering over her rolling
shoulders as she slinks through the grass like a lioness.
Toothless follows, mesmerized.
EXT. NEW BERK - WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
SQ. 1601 - FIRST DATE
Toothless zigzags through the woods, determined not to lose
the Light Fury again. Finally, he spots her coming to a
landing on...
EXT. NEW BERK - BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
... a sparkling lake-side beach flanked by tall, grassy
bluffs. The Light Fury shakes out her wings and folds them,
rolling her neck in the dim twilight of dawn.
Toothless stands at the top of the bluff, looking down at
her. She turns, waiting to see what he will do. Toothless
tries to look regal and composed and prepares to descend the
bluff, but he immediately loses his footing on the loosely
packed sand. He tumbles down the steep incline, coming to a
messy landing. He pops up to his feet, shaking off the
embarrassing spill. The Light Fury watches him, confused, and
sits down facing him.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

54.

Meanwhile, Hiccup settles in to the bluff above where
Toothless was, lying on his stomach to watch while remaining
undetected.
The Light Fury reattempts the invitation to the courtship
dance. She settles, awaiting his move. Toothless stares,
uncertain of what to do. He glances back toward Hiccup,
hidden in the grass. Hiccup mimes, flapping his arms and
throwing his head back.
Toothless takes the cue and flaps his wings excitedly,
beaming a gleeful smile. The Light Fury is unimpressed, and
grooms herself disinterestedly.
Toothless looks back up at Hiccup for support. Hiccup starts
to mime another wing-flapping behavior, but he steps on a
twig and dives back into the grass, afraid of detection.
The Light Fury looks up toward the sound, but does not see
Hiccup. She turns back to Toothless, now looking somewhat
wary and suspicious.
Toothless smiles awkwardly and begins to hover toward the
Light Fury as she eyes him, confused. He gets a little too
close and kicks up a spray of sand all over her.
Toothless glances back to Hiccup: “What now?” Hiccup tucks
his thumbs in his armpits and paces, jutting his head in and
out like a chicken.
Toothless imitates Hiccup, clucking around the beach
awkwardly. The Light Fury watches, confused by the strange
display.
Seeing that it isn’t working, Toothless tries a desperate
medley of mating displays, each one more ridiculous than the
last.
Hiccup covers his eyes with his hands, cringing at Toothless’
disastrous display.
As Toothless nears her, she swats at his face like a cat and
flaps off to a nearby tree, hanging herself inverted from its
limbs. She snaps her wings closed, covering her face.
Toothless approaches the tree and creeps out onto the limb.
Hiccup waves his hands, miming that it will break under his
weight. Toothless misinterprets the signal and begins
bouncing on the branch. The Light Fury opens her wings,
annoyed, as Toothless bounces her up and down.
The limb snaps, sending Toothless crashing head-first into
the sand.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

55.

He shakes off the dizzying thump as the Light Fury peeks
through a wing, then snaps it shut. Toothless shakes his
head, frustrated.
He eyes the broken branch at his feet and gets an idea. He
picks it up and begins to draw in the sand.
The Light Fury opens an eye, and then the other, squinting in
curiosity.
Toothless works feverishly, going over his lines repeatedly,
brushing sand over them with his tail when he makes a
mistake.
Curious, the Light Fury drops from her perch and slowly
approaches, tilting her head, taking it in, amused. As he
finishes, Toothless steps back to reveal a childish portrait
of the Light Fury etched in the shimmering sand.
Toothless adds a smile, completing the portrait.
Hiccup is baffled by the display.
HICCUP
Oh, now you can draw?
She steps on one of Toothless’ lines in the sand. He snarls
reactively -- but she snarls back, sharply. He recoils
apologetically. She crosses over the drawing toward
Toothless... and touches his nose with hers. Toothless beams
a dopey grin.
The Light Fury turns and flaps off, attempting to lead him
away. Toothless tries to follow, but crashes down into the
sand and rocks repeatedly due to his unmanned tail.
The Light Fury circles, waiting for him to take wing,
confused. Toothless tries desperately to join her, but
cannot.
The Light Fury spots Hiccup, spying from the bushes, and
flies off with a snort, as Toothless dives after her,
distraught. He lands in the water and looks mournfully after
her, half submerged. He glares at his useless tail, and slaps
it down into the water. He hangs his head.
Hiccup watches from above, looking guilt-ridden. He gets an
idea.

curiously.
ASTRID
Oh, someone hasn’t slept.
Hiccup grabs a handful of black Toothless scales and drops
them into a mortar. He mashes them up with a pestle.
HICCUP
Well, that Light Fury won’t let me
within a mile of her. And neither
of us will be getting any sleep or
finding the Hidden World until
Toothless takes over.
Hiccup is toiling away at a makeshift workbench as Toothless
hovers over him, panting. As Hiccup peers through a
magnifying glass, Toothless pushes his face aside to look,
steaming up the glass.

Hey! What do you think of that?
Yeah!
ASTRID
You tried this once before. He
didn’t want it.
HICCUP
Until now, he didn’t have a reason

Hiccup holds up the mortar to Toothless. On cue, Toothless
SPITS into it, adding slobber to the mixture.
Astrid smiles. Hiccup grabs a paintbrush and meets her eyes.
What?

ASTRID
No, nothing. I’m impressed. I mean,

Hiccup shrugs, painting the tail.

Astrid rolls her eyes. Hiccup finishes coating the tail in
paint. He lifts and splays it in front of Toothless.
Toothless GURGLES in awe.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Alright. Fire when ready!
Toothless produces a small fireball. It washes over the
paint, drying it instantly.
He then holds it up for Toothless, who blasts it with fire.
He folds the tail, revealing Gobber, covered in soot and
glowing embers.
GOBBER
Well. I guess you know the tail is
fireproof.
Hiccup cringes as Toothless runs around, frantically.
HICCUP
Okay, Toothless! Okay, yes I know,
I know -- shh shh shh. Okay, I

He attempts to fit the new prosthetic as Toothless wags his
tail excitedly.

Well, well, well! Someone’s

prosthetic, affixing the matching brace to Toothless’ natural
half-tail.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Attaboy! Lookin’ sharp, Toothless!

Toothless flares, tilts, and collapses his half-tail. The

precision.

Toothless smiles, gurgling excitedly. He wipes a slobbery
tongue across his face.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Pfft! Save it for your girlfriend!
Go on, get out of here!
Toothless bounds off -- then pauses, suddenly aware of the
magnitude of his newly gifted independence. He turns back to
Hiccup, looking uncertain.
It’s okay.

HICCUP (CONT’D)

Toothless smiles, and with an eager down-flap, he takes wing,
racing off into the sky -- awkwardly at first. After a few
wobbly maneuvers, he gets the hang of it and flaps off with
grace.
Toothless vanishes into the distance. Hiccup’s smile fades,

Valka and Cloudjumper cruise over a cloudy sky. Below, fog
covers the open sea like a blanket.
A break in the fog reveals a lone ship below. Valka steers
Cloudjumper toward it. As they descend toward it, the
thinning fog reveals a vast armada at sea. Valka takes it in,
concerned. Her gaze moves up to see a strange FLOATING
AIRSHIP hovering menacingly.
Suddenly, a Deathgripper explodes of the fog, tackling
Cloudjumper, mid-air!
Valka is knocked from her standing position. She hooks her
staff to Cloudjumper’s crown of spikes and swings to a rough
landing on his flank. A second Deathgripper attacks from the
other side, its exposed tusks gashing Cloudjumper’s side and
barely missing Valka. It raises its scorpion-like tail,
exposing the glistening barb.
Watch out!

It strikes! Valka parries, knocking the barb shy of its
target. One of the Deathgrippers clamps down onto
Cloudjumper’s wing with its serrated pincers. Cloudjumper
grabs it in its massive talons and rips it free, tearing a
gash in his own wing.

realize that it’s his own. He BLASTS A FIREBALL, frustrated,

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

His ear plates twitch at the sound of a distant explosion. He
twists his head around and lights up, hopeful.
He looks around, twitching his plates, desperate for any sign
of the Light Fury. Detecting something, he turns to his side.
The Light Fury materializes, head to tail, out of thin air -her mirror-like scales cooling in the wind.
Toothless exclaims, ecstatic, showing off his new tail. She
peels off, coyly. Toothless gives chase, determined not to
lose her again.
She looks at him before blasting a ball of fire and flying
through it, as if to say, “Watch! I’ll teach you”. Toothless
chases her into the fiery funnel, close on her tail. When he
emerges from it, she’s gone -- once again disappeared.
Toothless looks every which way, then spots her far above,
heaving her wings into a storm cloud. Toothless jackknifes
skyward and pours on the speed, catching up in the flashing
thunderhead.
As lightning crackles all around, Toothless tries to
replicate the Light Fury’s cloaking ability. He blasts a
fireball and flies through it. He looks at himself as he
emerges -- nothing’s changed. She shows him again, firing
another blast and diving through it, disappearing with grace.
She reappears moments later by his side, chortling: “Try
harder. You can do it.”
Brow furrowed in determination, Toothless inhales deeply and
blasts a larger fireball. He dives through it, but once again
emerges unchanged. Toothless is embarrassed; he so clearly
wants to impress her. He ‘blushes’ glowing blue and ROARS in
frustration.
Suddenly, his rage draws the surrounding electricity of the
thunderhead. Lightning bolts strike him from every direction,
producing a blinding flash. As it dissipates, he’s gone. The
Light Fury looks around, concerned. She calls out.
Nothing. Then, as her panic sets in, Toothless reappears in
the distance, his own scales cooling off. He spirals, dizzy
and dazed. The Light Fury races to him, elated, exclaiming,
“You did it!” She bolsters him as he smiles, groggy but
proud, clearly sapped by the jolting experience.
Together, they pierce the top of the thunderhead, rotating
around one another, face to face. They reach their apex and
cease flapping, slowing to a halt against a crescent moon.
Toothless leans in, nuzzling her, nose to nose, while they
hang momentarily. He steals a kiss -- a quick lick.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

61.

Her eyes flare, surprised by his cheekiness, as she falls
backward into an inverted swan-dive, wings outstretched.
Toothless mirrors her. Their silhouettes peel apart against
the pale moon as they spiral into a free fall, sounding out
in glee.
As layers of cloud pass them by, the Light Fury gracefully
arcs over the water. Toothless glides beside her, beaming a
dopey, gummy smile. She extends her wing tip to touch his
own. They glide, side by side, hand in hand. He coos,
reveling in the moment.
She steers Toothless toward a distant column of mist, rising
into the night. They climb, higher and higher as the curious
sight takes on definition.
Through the column of mist, Toothless spies what appears to
be a gargantuan hole in the sea (created by an undersea
volcano meeting the surface). Immense waterfalls form a nearperfect circle, roaring thunderously into a chasm of epic
proportion. It appears to be a mile wide, maybe more.
As Toothless squints, perplexed, the Light Fury turns to him,
uttering softly: “My home.” He stares at her, nodding in
understanding. He gurgles back: “Take me there.”
She grabs hold of his talons, surprising Toothless. Together
they tumble through the air like fighting eagles, dizzily
plunging into the mist of the vast hole... and disappearing
into its mysterious depths.

Roaring WHOOPS fill the air. Hiccup is jostled on the

Stoick would be proud!
As sun sets on New Berk, a feast rages in full swing. A
bonfire roars in the center of the plaza. Buildings stand in
mid-construction as the raucous Berkians celebrate the day’s
work in true Viking fashion. Dragons join in on the fun.
HICCUP
(mid-air)
Okay guys, now I’m just getting
sick.
They set Hiccup down. He laughs halfheartedly and stumbles,
stifling some vomit. Gobber scoops him close, throwing his
prosthetic mug attachment around Hiccup, spilling mead all
over him.
GOBBER
Gotta say, I thought you were well
off yer rocker, but this spot ain’t
half bad.
HICCUP
This was supposed to be a temporary
solution.
Eret walks up, taking in the merriment with a smile.
ERET
It’s unanimous, everyone agrees
we’ve definitely traded up. Well
done, Chief.
Hiccup laughs nervously, but continues eyeing the sky, antsy,
his mind elsewhere.
HICCUP
What if the tail broke? What if
Grimmel found him? What if he needs
me?
Gobber swipes a tankard of mead from a passing Viking and
shoves it in Hiccup’s hands.
GOBBER
Would you relax? He’s probably
having the time of his life.

I’m saying, how do we know if she’s

Gobber raises an eyebrow.
Us?

GOBBER

Hiccup shrugs off Gobber’s arm and hands the tankard to
another passing Viking. He takes it happily, swilling as he
staggers off.
HICCUP
You know what I mean. She’s so wild
and skittish. I’m just gonna say it
-- I don’t trust her.
Gobber laughs heartily.
GOBBER
Can’t tame ‘em all, Hiccup. One
day, you’ll have to snip those
apron strings and let Toothless
stretch his wings. Reminds me of a
talk I had with Stoick about you.
The advice sits poorly with Hiccup. Gobber notices a pack of
Hobgobblers, eyeing him from the bushes, their blank eyes
glimmering in the light of the bonfire.
GOBBER (CONT’D)
Gah! Where do they keep coming
from?!
Who?

HICCUP

Hiccup glances at the underbrush. They’re gone.
GOBBER

Hiccup grins, shaking his head.

He wiggles his prosthetic arm and wooden leg as proof.
Tuffnut pops in from out of nowhere, startling them.
TUFFNUT
Hiccy. A moment? Listen, I’ve been
watching you walk. Lose the limp.
No one’s gonna marry that.
HICCUP
I have a prosthetic leg.
So have I!

GOBBER

TUFFNUT
And I have a parasitic twin, but
you don’t see me limping around
about it. C’mon.
They continue to walk back toward the village. Gobber trails
behind, still looking around anxiously. He glances back over
his shoulder and suddenly, the pathway is full of Hobgobblers
again. He yelps and runs off.
TUFFNUT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Chin up, Hiccy. Puff out that
chest. Move that butt to the left a
little bit.
Suddenly, Cloudjumper flaps past them. He comes to a landing
in the center of the plaza, clearly injured. Valka dismounts,
looking disheveled.
Hiccup heads over, concerned.
HICCUP
Mom! Are you hurt? What happened
out there?
Astrid joins, looking alarmed.
VALKA
I don’t know how, but Grimmel is

If Grimmel is leading them here, we
have to take him out of the mix.
TUFFNUT
Uh, and how would we do that?

Shapes blur past. In the distance, dragon silhouettes fly low
to the water, coasting silently, then arcing up as they reach
the rocks. Hiccup sits behind Astrid on Stormfly. Astrid
turns to Hiccup, and he nods. Hiccup dives from Stormfly,
throwing open his wing-suit to glide and break his fall.
ON THE GROUND
Hiccup touches down with a quiet thud, then rises, quickly
stowing his wings. He looks around, counting his team as they
stand, each dressed in dragon armor, stowing their own wing
flaps. He gestures to split up. Astrid nods, then scurries up
the rocks toward the glowing window.
INSIDE
Grimmel lifts his hand and gestures toward the door, and his
Deathgrippers rise and scuttle out of the room, sniffing the
air and hissing, entering...
THE FOYER, a large open beamed room, though most of its beams
have caved in forming a crisscrossed, disheveled maze.
Wreckage litters the floor. Moonlight spills in from
demolished walls.
The Deathgrippers HISS in unison, tusks extending from their
heavy jaws. They spilt up, searching the area, keenly aware
of the intruders and determined to hunt them down.
SNOTLOUT
(whispered)
Okay, split up. We’ll be harder to
catch.
The group completely ignores Snotlout.
ERET

I was thinking we should split up.
Just because.
VALKA
(whispered)
I like your instincts.
They rush off together, leaving Snotlout behind.
SNOTLOUT
What is this?!
Hiccup and his team dart between lumps of wreckage, climbing

corner, narrowly evading detection.

Hiccup points to the lit doorway, indicating the target.
Above, Hiccup carefully creeps up the crumbling stairway that
leads to the lamp-lit room. He retrieves his dragon blade and
rushes up the steps... finding it empty.
CLOSE ON
A slender hand, pulling a rope.
Suddenly, nets drops from the turret, cascading down in every
direction. In one fell swoop, Hiccup and his team are trapped
inside with the Deathgrippers.
Hiccup looks around, panicked. Fishmeat wakes and starts to
WAIL. Hiccup glares at Fishlegs, shaking his head.
FISHLEGS

Shhh! Shhhh! Quiet!
A match strikes, lighting a lantern. Grimmel steps into view
on the other side of the nets.
GRIMMEL
Where’s your dragon when you need
him, hmm, Chief? Must have
forgotten all about you.
Hiccup and the others rise from hiding, carefully eyeing the
HISSING Deathgrippers, looking for an escape route.
GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
First rule of the hunt! Separate
the prey from its pack. You’ve just
removed yourselves from the
equation!
The Deathgrippers close in on the prisoners awaiting
Grimmel’s signal.
HICCUP
Why are you doing this?
GRIMMEL
Really? I didn’t think you cared.

Well, unlike you, when I was a boy

That nonsense dies now. Starting

The wreckage is instantly set aflame. Beams sizzle and snap,
dissolved by the acid.
Split up!

Valka leaps out of the way of a blast, climbing a fallen beam
toward the netted rooftop. She whirls her staff, creating an
urgent, high-pitched whistle.
Up here!

VALKA

In response, Cloudjumper dives from the night sky, grabbing
talon-fulls of netting and hoisting the ropes into the air
with her four powerful wings. Valka slashes the taut ropes
with her serrated, hooked staff, ripping a hole in the net.

SNOTLOUT
Go, go, go, go, go!
The Deathgrippers lunge after them, clawing their way up the
wreckage with their heavy pincers, snapping ferociously at
their heels.
As Valka stretches the hole wide, the team dives through,
plummeting in mid air. Each is grabbed by their passing
dragons.
Hiccup!

VALKA

Lastly, Hiccup rushes through, glancing back at the inferno
beneath. A Deathgripper explodes from the flames like a
breaching Great White. He leaps out of the way as it chomps
into the net, falling away, entangled. Valka hooks her staff
onto Cloudjumper’s talons and grabs Hiccup by the hand.
VALKA (CONT’D)
Gotcha. Go, Cloudjumper!
Cloudjumper drops the net, allowing it to collapse upon the
flaming wreckage, trapping the struggling the Deathgrippers
as they writhe and ROAR in fury.
The team escapes into the night sky as the GOREGUTTER flies
in, following Fishlegs’ commands.

Yeah! Our hero!
He lowers his head and uses his massive antlers to smash into
the top of the tower, causing the top to collapse down onto
the Deathgrippers.

Stormfly suddenly pulls up, revealing a vast hole in the sea
with thunderous waterfalls cascading inward. Hiccup and
Astrid gawk, astounded, as Stormfly circles the epic,
otherworldly sight -- a great volcanic caldera meeting the

She flies them beneath a low overhang and into a tunnel. The
darkness gives way to an otherworldly glow as the
phosphorescent river beneath throws patterns up the tunnel
walls.
Look!

Hiccup points out the shape of a bioluminescent SEA SHOCKER
dragon, swimming in the currents below them.
Stormfly follows the river to its end, dropping off of a
cliff and into a massive gallery of columns, covered in
bioluminescent fungi. Clusters of dragon eggs glow as
Stormfly soars past. She too displays a bioluminescent
pattern, as though flying under black lights.
Astrid and Hiccup are astounded.
The starry ceiling above suddenly shifts and undulates, as
thousands of tiny FIREWORM dragons descend from the cavern
ceiling and playfully chase Stormfly.
Finally, the “Mushroom Forest” gives way to a third chamber -vast and glowing with warm light carried from deep magma
veins via great pillars of crystal. Gargantuan coral
structures fan out in dramatic displays, growing mid-air in
the damp, salty atmosphere. Here, THOUSANDS OF DRAGONS have
gathered in an excitable hive of activity.
Astrid and Hiccup tuck low in the saddle as Stormfly flies
them closer to the epicenter of activity -- “King Island.”
To avoid detection, Astrid steers Stormfly toward a smaller
formation at the shore of Kind Island, landing in the cover
of a canopy of goliath mushrooms.
Hiccup and Astrid hop off and follow Stormfly as she sniffs
the air and scampers up the steep, moist terrain.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
It really does exist.
Stormfly reaches a cliff and straightens, pointing her head
like a hunting dog. Hiccup and Astrid crawl to the edge and
GASP in unison.
Rising from the gathered throngs of dragons, a great monument
of crystal rises like a tower. From above, Toothless and the
Light Fury lead a procession of dragons through the air,
zigging, zagging, and looping in a kind of arial dance.

pays his respects to the alpha. Toothless spreads his wings
and lets out a mighty roar.
ASTRID (CONT’D)

Now that’s a king.
No longer the clumsy amateur, Toothless throws his head back,
clucking and mirroring the Light Fury in a strange yet
beautiful ritual. He settles and nuzzles her gently, then
looks out upon his constituents, noble as a lion with his
pride. Below them, thousands of dragons lower their heads and
bow.
All the while, Hiccup watches quietly, visibly unsettled by
the sight of Toothless so at home in this foreign world.
Astrid notices. Her smiles fades, replaced by a look of
sympathy. She reaches out to comfort him.

The Rumblehorn ROARS, sending up a piercing alert.A thousand
dragon heads turn at once. Toothless is shocked to spot
Hiccup and Astrid in the distance, fleeing for their lives.
Toothless scrambles to the air in a panic, leaving the Light
Fury confused. He ROARS at the pursuing dragons heading
toward the intruders, with bared teeth and glowing mouths.
Some heed his command and fall back.

Others are far ahead of Toothless and closing in. Hiccup and
Astrid scramble over the ever-changing terrain, trying to
outrun them.
Go, go!

ASTRID (CONT’D)

Toothless races through the throng of aggressive dragons,
COMMANDING them to back down. He swoops in and plucks Hiccup
and Astrid out of the onrush, carrying them up toward the
cavern ceiling.
HICCUP
I’m sorry, Bud! I-I just...
Toothless BARKS back sharply and carries them into the
distance, far from the agitated crowd. Stormfly follows,
reuniting with Astrid.

Hiccup’s face, remorseful and pensive, as Toothless flies him

INT. OLD BERK - STOICK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
FLASHBACK Seq 2341- “With Love Comes Loss”
Hiccup, age 6, descends the staircase from his bedroom loft
to find Stoick seated by the fire. The stair creaks and
Stoick turns with a start, quickly wiping glistening tears
from his face.
STOICK
Son. You should be asleep.
Hiccup sits on the steps guiltily, aware that he’s witnessed
something he shouldn’t have.
HICCUP
I was thirsty.
Stoick softens and beckons Hiccup over with a sweep of his
hand.
STOICK
Yeah. Come here.
Hiccup descends the last few steps and climbs into his
father’s lap by the warmth of the hearth.

HICCUP
(carefully)
Dad? Are you gonna get us a new
mom?
Stoick stares at him, taken aback. He hugs Hiccup tightly,
then raises Hiccup’s chin to meet his eyes.
STOICK
I don’t want another. Your mum was
the only woman for me. She was the
love of my life.
Hiccup turns to the flickering flames, considering his words.
STOICK (CONT’D)
But with love comes loss, son. It’s
part of the deal. Sometimes it
hurts, but in the end, it’s all
worth it.
Stoick smiles warmly.
STOICK (CONT’D)
There’s no greater gift than love.

CLOSE ON
Hiccup’s face as he rides on Toothless, still lost in
thought. He glances at Astrid as they descend toward New Berk
to land. She eyes him sympathetically.
They touch down on an open pasture by the shear cliffs, some
distance from the halted construction. Hiccup dismounts and
considers the village, then turns toward Toothless, who
stirs, eyes downcast.
Hiccup throws a glance toward Astrid, who nods in
encouragement. He takes a DEEP BREATH and rounds Toothless to
face him.
HICCUP
It’s okay, Bud. You belong there.
With her. We don’t.
Toothless cocks his head, seeming to understand.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

He COOS, clearly conflicted.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
And that’s alright. We’ll find a
way to mana-Suddenly, Toothless’ ear plates twitch. He looks back toward
the open pasture. The wind rustles through the long grass. He
raises his head, curious.
At first, he sees nothing... then a gust parts the grass
blades, revealing the Light Fury crouched like a stalking
lioness.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Hey! She followed us back!
Toothless hops to his feet, elated. He bounds toward her,
tongue flapping in a fit of joy. He leaps into the air and
tackles her into the grass. They tumble down the bluff, head
over tail, GURGLING with glee.
Hiccup watches, beaming. He turns to Astrid, relieved.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
We might not have to say goodbye
after all!
Toothless stands and gently leads the Light Fury toward
Hiccup and Astrid. “My Home,” he COOS. She cautiously
follows, uncertain.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
That’s it...
RUFFNUT (O.S.)
Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Suddenly, Ruffnut appears, landing on the dragon Grimmel
gifted her.
Ruffnut?

ASTRID

She hops off, beaming and twirling triumphantly.
Miss me?

RUFFNUT

ASTRID
How’d you escape?!

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

RUFFNUT
I annoyed them ‘til they let me go!
Heh, heh. So dumb.
Ruffnut tosses her braids. Hiccup and Astrid exchange a look
of concern,
HICCUP
Wait. Grimmel let you go?
She throws them a knowing wink.
RUFFNUT
They couldn’t handle me.
(beat)
See, everyone thinks that Tuffnut’s
more annoying, but -Hiccup’s eyes flare, alarmed.
ASTRID
-- Wait, hold on.
HICCUP
Ruffnut. Focus. Were you followed?
She gawks at him, blankly, then smirks.
RUFFNUT
I never look back, Hiccup.
Panic floods Hiccup’s face. He spins around toward Toothless
and the Light Fury.
Toothless.

HICCUP

Hiccup takes off toward him...
... as Toothless leads the Light Fury closer.
TOOTHLESS!

HICCUP (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Suddenly, a rustle in the grass spins the Light Fury around.
She SNIFFS the air.
Alarmed, she SHRIEKS and takes flight! But it’s too late: a
DART whizzes through the air and HITS her in the neck! She
tumbles to the ground, nearly sliding off the cliff.
Toothless bellows furiously, rushing toward her...

83.

HICCUP (CONT’D)
Toothless, come back!
... Only to discover Grimmel rising from the tall grass ahead
of him.
Before Toothless can blast, Grimmel FIRES a dart into his
neck. Toothless ROARS, but immediately succumbs to the
tranquilizer.

ON HICCUP, running through the tall grass, panicked.
No!

HICCUP

Grimmel clips a ring to a long length of chain. In the
background, his AIRSHIP rises into view. He grabs hold of the
chain as it grows taut, lifting him into the air from the
chassis of the airship, standing atop his dangling, freshly
captured Furies, like a prize hunter with his kill.
Hiccup slows, horrified as the airship rises above him.
Several Berkians race to his side. Behind them, their dragons
fly to the scene, ROARING aggressively.
Grimmel climbs onto an outstretched arm of the airship and
leers back.
GRIMMEL
And now our little game must come
to an end.
The Berkian dragons close in and open their mouths to blast.
In response, Grimmel aims a mounted canon at the Light Fury.
Toothless groggily looks up to see the barbed harpoon fixed
squarely on his unconscious mate.
GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
Call them off, Alpha. No reason for
her to die too.
Toothless looks at the arriving flock, throats aglow,
awaiting his command. He ROARS a command: “Stand Down!” The
dragons immediately swallow their fire, peeling back.

SNOTLOUT
What are they doing? They can
totally take him!
HICCUP
Not with her life is on the line!
The Deathgripper scouts circle the airship, nipping at
Toothless and the Light Fury. Toothless BARKS at them, trying
to force them into line.
GRIMMEL
Save your breath! The only alpha
they respond to is me.
Toothless turns to Hiccup, pleading and helpless. Hiccup can
only stare back, guilt-ridden.
GRIMMEL (CONT’D)
Oh, don’t feel too badly. You tried
your best. But you are nothing
without your dragon.
Hiccup glowers in the sting of Grimmel’s words.
The airship recedes. Toothless commands the dragon flock to
follow, as the Deathgrippers circle like sheepdogs.
Hiccup chases after them, halted by the edge of the cliff.
TOOTHLESS!

Valka holds back the others with a gesture. She turns to
Astrid.
VALKA
He’ll listen to you.
Astrid nods and heads off toward Hiccup. She stops short,
facing the open sky, as Hiccup continues to pace, worked up.
HICCUP
Don’t say it.
ASTRID
I wasn’t going to.
HICCUP
I shouldn’t have dragged you out
there. He wouldn’t have flown me
back. She wouldn’t have followed.
Astrid nods, staring ahead.
Yep.

ASTRID

HICCUP
Ugh! I feel like the same screw-up
I was before I met Toothless.
ASTRID
I can see that.
He turns to face her, exasperated.
HICCUP
Are you just going to stand there
and agree with everything?
She shrugs.
ASTRID
Well, you’re right. You’re back to
where you started. But I was the
first to believe in you. And I’ve
watched you doubt whether you’re
worthy ever since.

He meets her eyes, bolstered by her stoic resolve.

And now it’s going to be a lot
harder.
Hiccup considers her words.
ASTRID (CONT’D)
So. What are you going to do about
it?
HICCUP
Probably something stupid.
ASTRID
That’s the Hiccup I know.
She smiles and gives her a peck of thanks the cheek. They
trudge back up the hill toward the group.
HICCUP
Suit up, Gang. We’re going to get

He’s lost his mind.
Tuffnut grabs Hiccup by the shoulders.

Grimmel’s airship hovers over the sprawling armada, flanked

Below, dragons are being loaded into cages. Cloudjumper,
Skullcrusher, and Grump are among them. Agitated, they SNARL
at the prodding soldiers.
SOLDIER
Watch yourselves!
A Solider jabs Cloudjumper with a spear.

Move it!

SOLDIER (CONT’D)

Cloudjumper GROWLS, threatening to attack. Above him,
Toothless sees this and ROARS at him. With the Light Fury
still in Grimmel’s harpoon sights, Toothless GROWLS a
command: “Just do as they say.”
GRIMMEL
That’s right, Alpha. No surprises.
Cloudjumper begrudgingly complies, but SWATS the soldier
with his tail as he resigns himself to the cage.
More dragons land and are forced into cages.
EXT. NEW BERK - SUNSET
Dressed in dragon armor, the Gang peers over the edge of the

HOLD ON, TOOTHLESS!
Toothless’s head suddenly turns, looking hopeful. Grimmel
turns, alarmed.
Through the clouds that encircle New Berk, he spots a distant
speck, hurtling toward him. Five others appear, further
still.
PUNCH IN on Hiccup, gliding from the heights of the towering
island, wings extended. Astrid and the Gang follow, SCREAMING
BATTLE CRIES. The Twins collide sloppily. Tuffnut clings
desperately to Ruffnut as she kicks him.
Let go!

RUFFNUT

Snotlout weaves, wildly out on control.
SNOTLOUT
Could’ve used some practice!
Fishlegs flaps his undersized wing-suit flaps, trying to stay
aloft with the extra weight of Fishmeat in his backpack.
FISHLEGS
I should’ve skipped breakfast!
Grimmel whirls the mounted harpoon cannon, taking aim at the
squadron. But before he can line up the shot, Hiccup careens
into him, knocking Grimmel from his position on the airship
arm, sending him flying as the cannon spins on its gimbal.
Grimmel tumbles, mid-air, and grabs a rigging line, grasping
desperately as it breaks his fall, leaving him swinging.
Toothless!

HICCUP

Toothless lights up, elated. He ROARS to dragons: “NOW!” The
dragons break away from the soldiers below, taking to the
air. On his COMMAND, Cloudjumper, Skullcrusher, and Grump
race back toward the island.
Hiccup collides with a billowing sail, cushioning his impact.
He sinks his dagger into the canvas. It tears as his own
weight pulls him down toward the deck below.

from the rafters by his cape again.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Game faces!
SNOTLOUT
Yeah! What are you waiting for? Get
in there!
The gang draw weapons and charge into the fray, meeting the
soldiers head-on.
Above them, Toothless struggles against the net that holds
him, ripping his muzzle apart with a ROAR. GRIMMEL looks
down, suddenly concerned, as Toothless takes aim. Grimmel
leaps out of the way as Toothless’ blast destroys one of the
airship arms, sending it spiraling. Grimmel clings to the
falling airship and WHISTLES a command to his Deathgrippers.
Below, ASTRID battles a soldier on a gangway. He parries her
blow and corners her, raising his sword for the kill, when...
Heads up!

HICCUP

... Hiccup cuts a nearby rigging line, releasing a sail boom
that sweeps through and sends the soldier flying off of the
gangway. Astrid beams at Hiccup.
ASTRID
Thanks.
(alarmed)
Look out!
Astrid throws her axe toward Hiccup, who dodges as it whizzes
past and takes out a soldier who was about to stab Hiccup.
Relieved, Hiccup smiles back at Astrid.
Thanks.

HICCUP

In a ROMANTIC MOMENT, they approach one another in SLOW
MOTION. Astrid grabs a canister from Hiccup’s belt, bites off
the wax seal, and tosses the gas-spewing canister like a
grenade to the deck below. Hiccup lights his Dragon Blade and
hurls it into the gas cloud. Soldiers panic and flee as...

... KABOOM! A fireball erupts, framing our enamored couple.
Astrid WHISTLES for Stormfly and points to Hiccup, then to
the sky. Stormfly swoops in and plucks Hiccup, carrying him
toward...
THE AIRSHIP, engulfed in flames, dropping steadily as the
Deathgrippers struggle to keep it aloft.
A freed Deathgripper RAMS Stormfly, knocking Hiccup out of
her grasp. Hiccup rolls and dives through the airship’s
inferno to get to Toothless...
HICCUP (CONT’D)
I’m coming, Toothless!
... As Grimmel shimmies down the chain to the Light Fury. He
twists a vial of venom into the Light Fury’s bridal, subduing
her into obedience.
GRIMMEL
(to Hiccup)
You still think he cares about
you?! Let’s just see who he
follows.
He releases a latch, springing the Light Fury from her
restraint. She flies off, groggy and obedient, carrying
Grimmel on her back.
Toothless watches, raging and struggling against his ties.
Hiccup races to free him.
HICCUP
I’m sorry, bud! For everything!
Just as the flaming airship CRASHES into the sea, Hiccup
PULLS the release latch, freeing Toothless.
They EXPLODE from the epic splash, pulling a comet trail of
smoke. The attached Deathgrippers are dragged undersea with
the airship as Hiccup and Toothless tear off in pursuit of
Grimmel and the Light Fury.

SNOTLOUT

... tosses his hammer back to Tuffnut, who effortlessly uses
it to knock out yet another.
TUFFNUT
Surprise! Sorry about that!
Come on!

SNOTLOUT

Snotlout rolls over the tussle and grabs the hammer, bringing
it down heavily to smash the lock off of a cage, freeing the
GOREGUTTER within.
SNOTLOUT (CONT’D)
Yeah! One more freed, four to go!
Try to keep up!
The Goregutter ROARS and takes to the air, passing Fishlegs
engaged in combat on an upper deck.
FISHLEGS
I got your backs!
He pushes his adversary off of the deck then, seeing his
friends about to be attacked by a horde of soldiers below,
grabs a line and hook, and swings down to their rescue,
knocking over soldiers like a wrecking ball.
He lands and eyes the damage, impressed.
FISHLEGS (CONT’D)
Yeah! It’s almost like we’re a
team!
The line and heavy hook swing back, knocking Fishlegs to the
deck and sending Fishmeat tumbling from his pouch. Ivar the
Witless raises his sword to the baby.
IVAR THE WITLESS
Aw. You brought a baby to a battle?
FISHLEGS
Un-uh. I wouldn’t do that if I were

Oh, I have missed this!

Ragnar KNOCKS Gobber to the deck, then pauses to notice a
lone Hobgobbler staring eerily from the railing. Gobber
smiles.
GOBBER
See that there?
Aw. Cute.

GOBBER
That’s a bad omen. You’re cursed!
Suddenly, the Hobgobbler SHRIEKS, signaling a horde of

Uh, what...what are you doing?
Amazed, Hiccup sees patches of Toothless' scaly skin begin to
turn mirror-like, including the Toothless scales on his own

attempting.

Hiccup.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Boy, you’re full of surprises.
Hiccup looks to the Light Fury, skittish and stirring in the
center of the crowd, but, for once, making no attempt to
flee. He gently waves her over, moving away from Toothless.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
He’s all yours.
He smiles and hops back into Astrid’s arms, giving them room.
The Light Fury approaches Toothless, sniffing and nuzzling
him. He coos, licking her face.
Hiccup and Astrid watch, smiling. He pulls Astrid into a hug.
Valka smiles proudly, then turns to Snotlout.
VALKA
You know, Eret may be blessed with
brawn... but just between us, you
have the brains.
He beams, finally validated.
SNOTLOUT
Number one.
Hiccup glances over at Toothless, entwined with the Light
Fury. Their eyes meet. Toothless looks to the open horizon,
then back to Hiccup, a silent question in his gaze: “Is it
time?” Hiccup understands... and nods. Toothless pauses,
considering the weight of the decision, then nods back.
Hiccup peels away from Astrid, taking a deep breath. He hops
over to Toothless, steadying himself against him.

HICCUP
You’re right, bud. It’s time.
(beat)
I was so busy fighting for a world
that I wanted... I didn’t think
about what you needed.
(beat)
You’ve looked after us for long
enough. Time to look after
yourselves.
He smiles at the Light Fury.
Astrid turns to Valka. She in turn looks to Gobber. They nod.
Astrid nods and walks to Stormfly, tears in her eyes. She
lays her forehead on Stormfly’s horn.
ASTRID
Oh Stormfly, my good girl.
Biting her lip with resolve, she removes Stormfly’s saddle,
dropping it on the ground.
Gobber gives Grump a pat, holding back tears. He unbuckles
Grump’s saddle and slides it off.
GOBBER
Alright, Grumpy. Off you go.
Eret nods and follows suit, removing Skullcrusher’s saddle.
ERET
So long you big, ugly beast. I’ll
miss you.
In solidarity, the other Vikings remove the saddles from
their dragons, each taking a moment to say goodbye, tears in
their eyes. Their dragons seem confused.
Valka caresses Cloudjumper’s muzzle, whispering to him
lovingly.
VALKA
Oh, Cloudjumper. Aw.
Tuffnut nudges Ruffnut as they exchange heartbroken looks.
Hiccup and Toothless watch as the remaining Vikings remove
their dragons’ saddles and say their goodbyes. He smiles,
tears in his eyes. He turns to Toothless and gently takes him
by the muzzle.

HICCUP
Go on, Bud. Lead them to the Hidden
World. You’ll be safe there. Safer
than you could ever be with me.
Toothless looks to the Light Fury, then back to Hiccup,
hesitant, conflicted. He COOS, his eyes glistening.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
It’s okay. I love you too. And I
want you to be free.
Toothless cocks his head, eyeing him closely.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Our world doesn’t deserve you. Yet.
Toothless reaches out and pulls Hiccup into an embrace.
Hiccup hugs him tightly.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Go, Toothless.
Hiccup lets go, and in a REVERSE MOMENT TO WHEN THEY FIRST
TOUCHED, he slowly pulls his hand away from Toothless’
muzzle.
Go.

HICCUP (CONT’D)

Toothless stares at Hiccup in understanding. Hiccup smiles,
tears in his eyes.
With a deep breath, Toothless ROARS, commanding an exodus.
The dragons break away from their Vikings’ embraces and join
him as he commands them to leave. The Light Fury takes
flight, leading the pack.
The rest of the Gang watch their dragons go, wiping away
tears.
The last dragons take flight, revealing that Toothless has
remained, standing at the edge of the cliff. He looks back to
Hiccup one last time. Hiccup nods.
Toothless returns a solemn nod, then leaps from the cliff and
flies off to join the flock.
The Vikings gather together as the dragons recede into the
distance.

Hiccup, watching them go.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NEW BERK - PLAZA - DAY (MONTHS LATER)
SQ. 3401 - WEDDING
In a MONTAGE, we see:
New Berk, snow-covered and now completed, far surpassing Old
Berk's former glory. A human paradise to match the dragons'
Hidden World, and a monument to the bygone age of dragons.
Colorful houses gleam radiant in the sunlight. A giant stone
statue of Stoick stands in the main plaza. The entire
population of New Berk is gathered.
Beneath the statue, Hiccup and Astrid stand facing one
another, dressed in fine clothing, as Gothi wraps their
clasped hands in a ceremonial cloth. Gobber and Valka stand
by, smiling proudly.
Gothi touches the cloth with her staff and nods. The wedded
couple kiss.
SPITELOUT
To the Chief and Chieftess!
Gobber throws up his arms in a CHEER. His wooden wedding
bouquet-hand flies into the crowd... and straight into Eret’s
hands. Eret looks up in surprise and smiles.
Snotlout SNIFFLES, trying to hide his emotion. Tuffnut pulls
him into his new and improved “facial hair.”
TUFFNUT
Come. Cry into my full, thick
beard.
Fishlegs BURSTS INTO TEARS.
FISHLEGS
Oh, it’s so beautiful!
He throws himself into Ruffnut’s arms.
RUFFNUT
Gross.
(then)
Okay, you win. I like sensitive
guys.

Crowd CHEERS and celebration fill the plaza.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NEW BERK - BLUFFS - SUNSET
Hiccup and Astrid walk hand in hand to the wind-buffeted
cliffs of New Berk. They gaze out toward a horizon no longer
teeming with dragons. Astrid rests her head on Hiccup’s
shoulder. Valka, Gobber, Eret and the Gang gather beside them
on the bluff, surrounding the Chief and Chieftess with pride.
CLOSE ON Hiccup’s face.
HICCUP (V.O.)
There were dragons when I was a
boy.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY (YEARS LATER)
SQ. 3501 - EPILOGUE
CLOSE ON YOUNG HICCUP, 5, eyes filled with wonder.
As we PULL BACK, we realize that the boy is actually Hiccup’s
SON, 3, nestled in his grown father’s arms. OLDER HICCUP, 30,
stands on a Viking ship, his eyes keenly focused ahead as the
prow rises and falls in the sea spray.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Oh, there were great, grim sky
dragons that nested on the cliff
tops like gigantic scary birds.
Little brown scuttly dragons that
hunted down the mice and rats in
well-organized packs.
Preposterously huge sea dragons
that were twenty times as big as
the big blue whale.
OLDER ASTRID, 30, abandons the rudder at the stern and
approaches the bow, leading their DAUGHTER, 5, by the hand.
She has large braided pigtails and skulls sewn into her fur
clothing -- a miniature Astrid. Together, they peer through
the mist that lies ahead. The roar of a massive waterfall
grows deafening.

HTTYD: The Hidden World - 12/05/18 - Final (DeBlois)

103.

HICCUP (V.O.)
Some say they crawled back into the
sea, leaving not a bone nor a fang
for men to remember them by.
Hiccup drops the anchor, just as the faint view of the great
hole in the sea looms into view.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Others say they were nothing but
folk tales to begin with.
(beat)
I’m okay with that.
Silhouetted on a lone rock by the waterfall’s edge, Toothless
lays stretched out like a proud lion standing guard. His ear
plates perk up. He turns toward the ship.
A moment later, the Light Fury sits up, followed by three
black & white babies (NIGHT-LIGHTS), all watching the ship
with curiosity.
Toothless gets to his feet and crouches aggressively, rolling
his shoulders like a panther about to pounce. His back plates
split and glow blue. He takes to the air, flapping toward the
ship.
Hiccup cringes. KABOOM! Toothless lands on the prow, rocking
the ship heavily. Hiccup braces himself, shielding his
family.
The kids scamper into Astrid’s arms, frightened. She holds
them close, uncertain if Toothless will recognize them.
Hiccup offers an open palm.
HICCUP
Hey, hey there Bud. Remember me?
Toothless rears up on his hind legs, glaring menacingly.
Behind them, Astrid postures herself to protect her cowering
children.
It’s okay.

ASTRID

Hiccup looks back at his family, then returns to face
Toothless with his hand up in surrender. Toothless SNIFFS it,
and suddenly a rush of recognition washes over his face. He
throws his front claws around Hiccup, toppling him over and
covering him in slobbery licks. Hiccup bursts into LAUGHTER.
HICCUP
I am glad to see you too, bud!

The kids squeal and bury their faces into Astrid. She LAUGHS,
relieved, as Hiccup and Toothless roll around on the deck.
ASTRID
He’s not going to eat your father.
Hiccup wriggles from under Toothless, looking him over.
HICCUP
How’s the tail holding up? Probably
could use some oil and a little
fine tuning.
Astrid tries to calm the rattled kids.
ASTRID
Look, it’s okay! They’re friends!
Hiccup looks back at them and waves them over.
Here.

HICCUP

ASTRID
Go on, it’s alright.
HICCUP
Come. He won’t hurt you.
Astrid urges the kids forward. They cling to one another as
they cautiously shuffle toward Hiccup.
Toothless cocks his head, gaping with a broad, gummy smile.
Hiccup takes their hands and positions them, open palmed
toward Toothless.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Hold your hands out. Like this...
(beat)
That’s it. Let him come to you.
Toothless sniffs and slowly approaches, touching their open
palms with his snout.
The kids’ utter soft GASPS of amazement. Wide-eyed smiles
flood their faces.

EXT. OPEN SKIES - MOMENTS LATER
Toothless and Hiccup rocket through the sky, spinning,
tumbling, and falling through the clouds.
Hiccup’s son is tucked in front of him, loving every second.
The Light Fury weaves around them. Their youngsters try to
keep up, following their mother like eager ducklings.
The Night Lights fly right up to Toothless and Hiccup, one of
them peering curiously at Hiccup’s son. The boy reaches out
and in response, the little dragon SQUEAKS in delight and
playfully paws at his hands.
Suddenly, Stormfly explodes across Toothless’ path, giving
them a fright. They look up to see Astrid and their daughter,
laughing on her back. The young girl HOOTS and HOLLERS,
pleased that they bested her dad and brother.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Legend says that when the ground
quakes, or lava spews from the
earth, it’s the dragons... letting
us know they’re still here...
Hiccup and his son exchange a mischievous grin. They crouch
low to the saddle and pat Toothless. He HEAVES after them.
HICCUP
... waiting for us to figure out
how to get along.
Hiccup spins over Stormfly to drop his son on Astrid’s
shoulders, then circles around and extends a hand to his
daughter. She grabs it and leaps onto Toothless’ back.
They playfully chase one another into the clouds.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Yes, the world believes the dragons
are gone, if they ever existed at
all.
(beat)
But we Berkians know otherwise. And
we’ll guard the secret until the
time comes... when dragons can
return in peace.
In a last burst of dazzling color, the dragons corkscrew into
the blinding sun.
FADE TO WHITE.
