THE GOOD WIFE

TEASER
A VIDEO IMAGE of...
...a packed press conference. A lower-third chyron trumpets
“Chicago D.A. Resigns” as the grim D.A. approaches a podium,
his wife beside him. He clears his throat, reads:
DAVID FOLLICK
Good morning. An hour ago, I
resigned as States Attorney of Cook
County. I did this with a heavy
heart and a deep commitment to fight
these scurrilous charges. At the
same time, I need time to atone for
my private failings with my wife,
Alicia, and our two children.
Oh, one of those press conferences. Scandal. In the key of
Elliott Spitzer. DAVID FOLLICK (40) is a back-slapping Bill
Clinton: smart, funny, calculatedly seductive, and now at the
end of his career. But he’s not our hero. Our hero is...
...his wife, ALICIA (late-30s) standing beside him. Pretty.
Proper. She’s always been the good girl-- the good girl who
became the good wife, then the good mom: devoted, struggling
not to outshine her husband. We move in on her as we hear...
DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
I want to be clear. I have never
abused my office. I have never
traded lighter sentences for either
financial or sexual favors.
Ugh. We suddenly enter the video, and we’re there with...
Alicia as she looks out at the excited reporters, the phalanx
of cameras all clicking, boring in on her.
DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
But I do admit to a failure of
judgment in my private dealings with
these women.
Dying inside, Alicia tries to keep a neutral expression on her
face as we see what she sees: the edge of the podium... the
crisp paper David reads from... his black coat... his sleeve.
DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
The money used in these transactions
was mine, and mine alone. No public
funds were ever utilized.
There’s a piece of lint on his sleeve. A half inch long.
Alicia just stares at it. The whole world tied up in that lint.

2.
DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
Alicia and I ask that the press
please respect our privacy. Give us
time to heal. With the love of God
and the forgiveness of...
Etc. Alicia only half-listening now. Sound dull, distant.
Her hand reaches slowly, unconsciously, toward the lint when---David clasps her fingers. Oh, he’s done. He guides her
offstage away from the reporters’ shouted questions, into...
EXT. GREEN ROOM - COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE MEDIA ROOM - DAY
...a backstage green room where two political ops sweep up:
POLITICAL OPS

toward her, sees how strangely removed she is.

David looks

DAVID FOLLICK
Are you alright?
Alicia looks up at him, and...
...SLAP! She slaps him so hard David falls to one knee,
looks up at her stunned. But Alicia, very controlled, very
proper, straightens her blouse, reaches for her purse, calmly
and coolly exits into... BLACK. And a title appears...
“Six months later.”
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - 27TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
Alicia waits, alone, in the 27th floor conference room of a
mid-level Chicago law firm. Opening a new chapter in her
life. She wears a new suit, new shoes, new looser hairstyle:
more career woman than political wife. She looks down at...
...a new leather binder where she’s written a one word heading:
Goals
Okay, goals.
clock: 9:45.

What goals? She stares at it. Glances up at a
Where is everyone? She goes to the door:

ALICIA
Hi, sorry, this is my first day.
Isn’t the staff meeting at 9:30?
An overbusy SECRETARY nods, clicking away at a computer.

3.
SECRETARY
You’re in the wrong conference
room. It’s up one floor.
Alicia stares at her, and-- shit!-INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL - TRIBUNE BUILDING - DAY
--BAM-- she slams into the stairwell, races up the stairs two
at a time, accidentally drops the leather binder-- it rattles
down a half-dozen flights. Screw it. Alicia bursts into-INT. RECEPTION - 28TH FLOOR - TRIBUNE BUILDING - DAY
--the firm’s reception.

“Stern, Lockhart & Garvin.”

ALICIA
Which way to the conference room?
TWO RECEPTIONISTS point through double doors. Alicia bangs
through them as the receptionists trade a look:
RECEPTIONIST #1
Is that her?
(the other nods)
Her hair’s different.
INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 28TH FLOOR - DAY
Alicia races past workstations, offices. Everything designed
in Greene & Greene colors in an attempt to warm up a cold
skyscraper build-out. Alicia slows as she sees...
...the glass-walled conference room. Packed with 45 seated
and standing associates, partners, paralegals!
Shit, shit,
shit. She’s late! She slips in...
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - 28TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
...the back, unnoticed behind a screen of standing junior
associates, all tall, young. Late 20s seems to be the age du
jour here. One notices her, smiles to himself. CARY (27).
Her competition. A bright and shiny Harvard grad. Looks like
a male model. At the front, a firm Partner wraps up:
WILL
--Anyway, Schering-Plough fired their
last firm for this very reason. So,
until further notice, your personal
lives have been canceled.
Chuckles from the room. WILL GARVIN (38). Handsome. A
guy’s guy. One of the “Top 50 Chicago Bachelors.” Makes it
all look easy-- life, law, sex. Another partner takes over:

4.
DAWNA
This is a complicated, multijurisdictional class action. So
we’ll need some of you to help out
with the lower-profile client-work
to free up our top litigators.
DAWNA LOCKHART (56). A tough, smart feminist. Dresses like
a million bucks. The top litigator at the firm, and in town.
WILL
And by “lower profile,” Dawna of
course means “crucially important.”
(the room laughs)
Ed, you’ll take witness prep on
Highway redistribution. Don, you’re
on the Brighton criminal. And
Alicia, you’ll take the pro bono.
Alicia looks up. What? What pro bono? It’s on a squeegee
board at the front-- “pro bono”-- but she missed the discussion.
WILL (CONT’D)
Everyone else, your task is to show
Schering-Plough our A-game. Okay?
Let’s do this.
And that’s it-- the associates all start out, gabbing, as
Alicia sees Will slip out the other door. Chasing...

Will turns, smiles. A warmer smile than usual.
history between them or is he always this nice?

Some kind of

WILL
Alicia. Sorry, I didn’t introduce
you in there, but everything’s
moving fast with this class action.
The two walk and talk-- everything on the run at this firm:
ALICIA
I just wanted to say thanks for the
opportunity, Will. It’s a real
life saver.
WILL
Hey, no, thanks for coming on
board. Hope you’re alright with
this pro bono. How’d it sound?

5.
Alicia stares at him.

Ummmm.

ALICIA
Interesting.
WILL
Good. Don’t be nervous. You
worried about the “bad facts?”
The... ?

ALICIA

“The Bitch is Back” plays. Oh, damn, Alicia’s cellphone.
She digs it out of her purse, snaps it off, as Will laughs:
WILL
Who gets “The Bitch is Back”?
ALICIA
My mother-in-law.
(Will laughs)
My daughter programmed it.
WILL
What’s your ringtone?
ALICIA
My--? I don’t think I want to know.
My kids aren’t too happy with me
getting my mother-in-law to help out
at home. So these bad facts...?
WILL
Right, I have to go into a meeting,
but-(sees Dawna down the hall)
Hey, Dawna, are you briefing Alicia?
(Dawna nods)
Good, you’re in good hands. So
we’ll have dinner, catch up.
And Will’s gone. A whiplashed Alicia jogs to catch up with
Dawna now. Moving fast:
DAWNA
So Will speaks highly of you. He
says you graduated top of your class
at Georgetown. When was this?
ALICIA
Fifteen years ago.
Uh-huh.

DAWNA
And you spent two years at...?

6.
ALICIA
Crozier, Abrams & Abbott.
Right.

DAWNA
Good firm.

Why’d you leave?

ALICIA
I... Well, I had kids.
husband’s career.

My

Dawna nods. Alicia eyes her, not sure if there’s a tone.
There doesn’t seem to be. Passing her assistant:
DAWNA
Brian, can you get Mrs. Follick the
files?
INT. DAWNA’S CORNER OFFICE - 28TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
And they enter Dawna’s large corner office. A Jack Russell
Terrier trots up. Dawna pets it as she slips on a headset.
DAWNA
I want you to think of me as a
mentor, Alicia. It’s the closest we
have to an old boy’s network in this
town: women helping women. Okay?
Okay.

ALICIA

DAWNA
When I was starting out, I got one
great piece of advice: “Men can be
lazy. Women can’t.” And I think
that goes double for you. Not only
are you coming back to the workplace
fairly late, but you have some very
prominent baggage with this scandal.
She nods to a photo of herself with Hillary Clinton...
DAWNA (CONT’D)
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Dawna smiles. Alicia smiles back as-- thump-- Brian drops a
FILE BOX beside her.
DAWNA (CONT’D)
Thanks, Brian. Like many law firms
we donate 5% of billable hours to
pro bono work so the indigent have
options other than the public
defenders office.
(MORE)

7.
DAWNA (CONT’D)
Sadly I’m long past my acceptable
billable hours on this one; so I
need to hand off the retrial.
Alicia takes notes, finds a mugshot taped to the top of the
box. Not what she expected. A sweet woman in her late 20s.
DAWNA (CONT’D)
Jennifer Combs. 29 years old. A
working mom. Taught second grade.
Accused of killing her ex-husband
in a faked carjacking. Prosecution
thought it was a slam-dunk 30 to
life, but the jury came back last
week deadlocked.
Alicia keeps trying to take notes, but the terrier sniffs and
nuzzles at her lap.
DAWNA (CONT’D)
Six jurors voted to convict; six not.
I’m not even sure why the D.A. is
retrying, except he wants-- Justice!
Alicia looks up.

What?!

Oh, the dog’s name.

DAWNA (CONT’D)
--he wants to prove himself. So
nothing fancy. Stick to my
strategy from the first trial. It
worked for reasonable doubt and a
deadlocked jury. Okay?
Alicia nods, but Dawna sees Brian outside talking with CORMAC
(58), the third partner, bullet-headed, says very little, but
when he does, he’s the voice of God.
DAWNA (CONT’D)
Okay, we’ll have to cut this short.
Our investigator can get you up to
speed for the bail hearing at 3.
(yelling out)
Cormac, I’m ready.
ALICIA
The bail hearing-- it’s today?
DAWNA
Yes, we could delay, but that would
leave Jennifer incarcerated for
another month. Don’t worry, you’ll
be fine. The D.A.’s not going to
argue against a recognizance release.

8.
INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 28TH FLOOR - DAY
And-- bang-- Alicia’s out the office door, standing there with
the file box. The assistant Brian offers a lint roller. Oh.
Her skirt covered with dog hair.
ALICIA

Thanks.

Alicia starts to brush it off when she notices Brian’s
computer: a “You Tube” video paused there. The infamous David
Follick press conference. Brian quickly clicks it off.
Embarrassed.
Sorry.

BRIAN
I like your hair this way.

INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL - TRIBUNE BUILDING - DAY
Alicia pushes into the stairwell. Needs a moment to herself.
Drop her office face. Looks down toward her fumbled leather
binder. “Goals” still written there. She starts down toward
it. When...
CARY
Hey, need some help?
Cary.

Peering down the stairwell.

INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - DAY
Cary carries the file box toward their neighboring offices:
CARY
I know we’re the two new associates,
and we should be at each other’s
throats, but I just want to say...
I’m in awe of what you’re doing.
Alicia studies him.

Is this guy for real?

CARY (CONT'D)
Raising a family, then jumping
right back into this. My mom’s
thinking of doing the same thing.
ALICIA
(stares at him)
...Great.
SONIA
I’m almost done, Cary. Latte on
your desk. Hi, Mrs. Follick.

Calculated?

9.

Hi.

ALICIA

SONIA (24), their shared assistant, rushing past, rolling a
FILING CABINET into Cary’s office. An overbusy Michelle
Williams-like college grad.
CARY
It looks like we share an
assistant. So tell me when I’m
hogging her, okay? And let the
best associate win.
(starts into his office)
Excuse me?

ALICIA

Cary turns back, sees her confusion.
CARY
Let the-- Oh. Nothing.
Nothing.

I--

And he enters his office. Alicia frowns: what the fuck was
that? She pushes her door open and finds...
INT. ALICIA’S OFFICE - DAY
...a woman sitting in her chair, flipping through a file. Sexy.
Casual clothes. Alicia pauses, checks the name on her door.
KALINDA
Don’t worry, it’s yours.
(standing)
Kalinda Sharma. The in-house.
ALICIA
Oh, right, the investigator. Dawna
said you’d take me through the pro
bono. Alicia Follick.
Alicia offers a hand. KALINDA SHARMA (25) barely shakes it. An
East Indian stunner. Bollywood Erin Brokovich. No-nonsense,
independent, a cool temperament, nonchalantly bisexual.
KALINDA
You’re David Follick’s wife?
ALICIA
That’s right.
KALINDA
I worked with him at the D.A.’s
office. He fired me.

10.
Oh.

Alicia stares at her.

This is getting old.

ALICIA
Look, I’ll give you his address if
you want to complain; but I have a
bail hearing at three, so can we do
this?
Tougher than she intended. Kalinda stares at Alicia, gets up,
goes to her, and... takes the file box. And...
...CUT TO LATER: She slaps a crime photo on the desk.
beside Lake Michigan splattered with blood.

A car

KALINDA
It started a year ago. A carjacking.
That’s what the cops thought at
first. Part of that series of
carjackings in Wilmette last year.
Thieves would target upscale cars...
Kalinda lays out three separate crime scenes: BMWs, Lexusus.
KALINDA (CONT’D)
...fix a clip to the fuel line,
follow the driver a half mile until
he ran out of gas, murder the
occupants, then take his car.
Kalinda hands Alicia grisly photos of victims shot in the
face, gauging her response. Not what she expected. Alicia
more fascinated than appalled.
KALINDA (CONT’D)
At first it looked like this newest
carjacking was just another in the
series. The only problem: the car
wasn’t upscale. An old 2001 Honda.
Also, there was no clip attached to
the fuel line. And, last, the
passenger was only shot in the arm.
(an injured Jennifer)
Jennifer Combs. She said her exhusband struggled with the
carjacker-- that’s why she was only
shot in the arm, and her ex-husband
was killed.
Alicia notices something in her file:
ALICIA
She taught at Francis Parker.
(Kalinda looks over at her)
It’s a good school.

11.
Kalinda just stares at her.

Okay.

Continues:

KALINDA
The cops began to think it was
actually a murder disguised as a
botched carjacking: Jennifer killed
her ex-husband, then shot herself
in the arm.
Alicia studies Jennifer’s mugshot. She looks like Alicia at
the press conference: overwhelmed, vaguely etherized.
EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
ALICIA
The weapon?
Alicia and Kalinda cross toward the criminal courthouse:
KALINDA
Never recovered. The cops
theorized she threw it into Lake
Michigan. They dragged the lake,
never found it. Gunpowder residue
was inconclusive.
INT. ELEVATOR - COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
ALICIA
And her motive?
The two whispering at the back of a courthouse elevator:
KALINDA
She was in a custody battle with
her ex-husband. He remarried and
wanted custody of their 3-year-old.
MIA’s “You’re Good” starts to play. Oh, damn.
ringtone. Alicia reaches into her purse.

Another

ALICIA
Sorry, my daughter.
INT. HALLWAY - PUBLIC SCHOOL - CHICAGO - DAY
Her daughter, GRACE (13), between classes, moving in a stream
of kids almost all talking on their cells. Mildly plump,
caught at that age between gawky and pretty.
GRACE
Hey, mom. I want to ask you a
question, but I don’t want you to
freak out, okay?

12.
INTERCUT with...
INT. THIRD FLOOR HALL - COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
Uh-oh.

ALICIA

Alicia now in a courthouse metal detector line with Kalinda.
GRACE
Forget it, I’ll ask Zach.
ALICIA
No, no, what?
GRACE
Some girl said dad slept with a
hooker my age, and I just-What?!

ALICIA

GRACE
They were playing that tape in
computer lab: dad with what’s her
name, Tina...?
Alicia closes her eyes: fuck.

As a guard gestures:

COURT GUARD
Ma’am, you’ll have to turn that off.
GRACE
And some girl said her dad was a
cop, and he said one of the hookers
was my age.
ALICIA
(steps out of line to talk)
First of all... they were all over
twenty. And, second: isn’t there a
teacher--? Why are they playing
that in computer lab?!
GRACE
It was the bleeped version. Don’t
worry, Mom. It’s not like I don’t
know this stuff. Look, I’ve got
History. I’ll see you tonight.
And-- click-- that’s it. Alicia shakes her head-- hates when
Grace plays it blase. She sees Kalinda impatient to continue.
She rejoins her, moving through the metal detector:

13.
KALINDA
Dawna’s defense was simple. The
cops never looked for a carjacker.
They immediately suspected Jennifer,
and ignored everything else. It
worked. The jury deadlocked.
Alicia nods as Kalinda pushes into Courtroom #402, looks back
at Alicia pausing at the door, intimidated. Staring in. No
judge yet. Bailiff and lawyers chatting. Play before curtain.
What?

KALINDA (CONT’D)

ALICIA
Last time I was in court was
thirteen years ago.
KALINDA
(dry)
Wow. I was twelve.
ALICIA
(looks at her)
Is that supposed to boost my
confidence?
And Alicia enters, starts up...
INT. COURTROOM 402 - COOK CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
...the aisle. It feels weird, opening the gallery gate,
crossing to the defense table, setting her documents on it.
A prosecutor looks over, looks again. MATAN BRODY (29),
African-American, cocky, likes the power if not the paycheck of
an A.D.A. He shoots a whisper to the other A.D.A.:
MATAN
That’s David Follick’s wife.
What?! SANDRA PAI (27), a tough Asian lawyer, looks over.
Matan stands, crosses to Alicia, air thick with schadenfreude:
MATAN (CONT’D)
Alicia! My god! How are you
doing? Matan, remember? From the
D.A. Christmas party?
ALICIA
Oh, yes, right. Hi.
MATAN
You’re at “Stern, Lockhart & Garvin”?

14.

Yeah.

ALICIA
First day.

MATAN
Wow, wow. Wow! Oh, this is Sandra
Pai. She’s new-- I mean, since
David. How’s he doing, by the way?
David?

ALICIA
Fine.

MATAN
Say hello for me, will you? He
gave me my first job, you know?
Look at all this.
(her documents; chuckling)
You’re gonna bury us. I don’t know
how you do it, Alicia. I’d be
huddled up in a ball somewhere.
Alicia nods, used to these passive-aggressive compliments, as-KLANG-- a security vestibule opens, the accused led out.
MATAN (CONT’D)
Well, back to work. Good luck.
And Matan and Sandra slip back to their table.
straight ahead, and allow themselves... grins.

Sit.

Stare

SANDRA PAI
Shooting fish in a barrel?
Turtles.

MATAN

Meanwhile, JENNIFER COMBS, is led to the defense table.
Alicia stands, startled. She’s lost a third of her weight.
Almost nothing left of the 2nd grade school teacher.
JENNIFER COMBS
Where’s Dawna?
ALICIA
I-- Dawna asked if I would step
in, Jennifer. I’m Alicia Follick,
one of the other lawyers at the
firm.
Step in?!

JENNIFER COMBS
For how long?

ALICIA
For the retrial.

15.
JENNIFER COMBS
(gasps)
Oh my god.
Alicia tries to reassure her, but everything’s moving too fast:
BAILIFF
All rise. The Criminal Court of Cook
County is now in session. The
honorable Judge Colin Bogira presiding.
JUDGE BOGIRA (62) enters. Not the happiest man in the world.
Ex-Marine. Losing his hair. His bench covered with paper
clips nervously twisted into various shapes.
Be seated.

JUDGE BOGIRA
Okay, let’s hear it.

The prosecutors look over at Alicia.
I...

Oh.

She stands.

Um...

ALICIA
Your honor...

She sorts through her documents. Matan, seeing an opportunity,
jumps to his feet (Chicago trials a contact sport):
MATAN
Your honor, just to refresh your
memory, the accused, Ms. Combs, was
deemed a flight risk due to an
earlier custody hearing-ALICIA
Your honor, I just-MATAN
--where she threatened to run off
with her daughter.
JUDGE BOGIRA
Yes, and yet just last week, a jury
deadlocked on these charges 6 to 6,
Mr. Brody. I know our new D.A. wants
to look tough, but why are you
fighting this?
MATAN
The People are prepared to retry
this case right now, your honor. If
Mrs. Follick is so intent on getting
her client out, why doesn’t she
agree to a speedy trial?
The judge looks up at the name.

Grins.

As if a dirty word:

16.
JUDGE BOGIRA
Mrs. Follick?
ALICIA
(sighs: here we go)
Yes, your honor.
JUDGE BOGIRA
The wife of our “esteemed” ex-D.A.
Your husband and I never quite saw
eye to eye, ma’am. In fact, I think
he got exactly what he deserved.
Alicia winces.

So does Jennifer sitting beside her.

ALICIA
Your honor, as you can see, I-JUDGE BOGIRA
Mrs. Follick. Don’t talk.
(Alicia doesn’t)
--but if the prosecution thinks
this will in some way prejudice me
against your client, he is sorely
mistaken. Nice try, Matan.
(Matan shrugs: worth a try)
Ms. Combs is granted pre-trial
release with electronic monitoring.
She’s restricted to her home,
attorney’s offices, and transit in
between. Given that this is a
rerun, I’ll set a trial date for
next week. Are we all happy? Good.
Bang-- he quickly hits his gavel, and that’s it. Alicia just
stands there, not sure what hit her. A stunned Jennifer
stands, shakes her hand:
Thank you.

JENNIFER COMBS

ALICIA
(doesn’t know what to say)
I... sure.

ACT ONE
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW FIRM - (NEXT DAY) - DAY
An electronic monitor. It blinks away on Jennifer’s ankle as
Kalinda and Alicia take notes, listening:
JENNIFER COMBS
We had a nice time. Michael talked
about missing his daughter, and about
the life we had together. He wanted
to drive along the lake, but we got a
flat. He was getting out to fix it
when I saw... a red pick-up truck.
(pained)
Do we need to do this again?
KALINDA
Mrs. Combs, we’re looking for
inconsistencies in your testimony.
So yes.
Jennifer swallows.

Alicia eyes her, sees how hard this is.

JENNIFER COMBS (O.S.)
The driver came up to Michael’s
window. He was wearing a ski mask,
and I... I didn’t see the gun until
Michael grabbed it. There was this
shot, and I saw... Michael’s face...
(pauses, unbearable)
ALICIA
Do you want to pause for a minute?
Kalinda shoots an irritated look toward Alicia.
No.

JENNIFER COMBS
Just if there were some water.

INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - DAY
Alicia leans out the conference room door:
ALICIA
Sonia, can you get us some water?
Sonia, at her workstation, covers her headset, whispers:
SONIA
I’m taking notes on Cary’s call.
How long?

ALICIA

18.

5 minutes.

SONIA
But then I’ve got his depo.

Alicia frowns, shoots a look toward Cary in his office.
ALICIA
Okay, tell me when you’re done. And
I need some filing cabinets in my
office.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - 27TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
Alicia returns to the conference room with bottled water,
finds Kalinda mid-questioning: more confrontational.
KALINDA
But that’s the problem. You say the
red pick-up truck came from here-(a crime scene map)
But there’s a Walmart surveillance
camera here. And the prosecution
played it to make you look like a liar.
JENNIFER COMBS
I’m not lying.
KALINDA
Then you’re mistaken, or something,
because the tape doesn’t show a
truck. And that’s why we’re facing
a retrial now, and not an acquittal.
ALICIA
(clears her throat, warmer)
What Kalinda is saying is-- couldn’t
you have been mistaken? Couldn’t
the car have come from... here?
Another part of the map. Jennifer stares at it, and a tear
rolls down her cheek. Kalinda rolls her eyes, backs away:
too much estrogen for her, as Alicia approaches, sees
Jennifer has a small worn photo. LILLY (3).
ALICIA (CONT’D)
Is that your daughter?
(Jennifer nods, shows her)
She’s beautiful.
JENNIFER COMBS
They won’t let me see her. My inlaws-- they have custody, and I-(chokes up)
In one day. Everything.
(MORE)

19.
JENNIFER COMBS (CONT'D)
My job, my life, my daughter.
Everything gone. What am I going
to do?
Jennifer cries.

Alicia eyes her sympathetically.

ALICIA
You’re going to take it one day at
a time, Jennifer. We got you
housing. Go there, take a shower,
take a nap, don’t turn on the TV.
Do you like reading?
(Jennifer nods)
I’ll get you some books. Fiction is
best. You won’t feel like putting
on nice clothes or make-up, but
force yourself to. Not for court,
for you. The superficial things
matter more than anything right now.
Jennifer wipes her eyes, nods, as Kalinda studies Alicia: for
the first time authoritative. Something she lived.
ALICIA (CONT’D)
Meanwhile, I’ll petition the court
for visitation rights. Okay?
JENNIFER COMBS
If they could even send some
pictures. The worst thing in prison
was not having photos of her.
Alicia nods.

Takes a second to consider this.

JENNIFER COMBS (CONT’D)
Do you think I have a chance?
ALICIA
I think the jury deadlocked 6 to 6.
I think Dawna’s strategy-- arguing
that the police were so quick to
focus on you, they never pursued the
real carjackers-- is a good one.
And I think we have the advantage of
interviewing the first jurors to see
how to improve our case. So, yes, I
think we have a very good chance.
Thank you.
I know.

JENNIFER COMBS
It’s hard.
ALICIA

20.
JENNIFER COMBS
Does it ever get easier?

No.

ALICIA
(considers it)

Jennifer smiles.

Likes her brutal honesty.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
But you do get better at it.
INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - DAY
Alicia sees Kalinda staring at her as they exit the room.
What?

ALICIA

KALINDA
Nothing. You go interview the
jurors; I’ll try to figure out how
a surveillance camera can lie-Alicia?

LAUREN YOST

Alicia turns, sees a woman approaching. LAUREN YOST (35), a
fit, pretty, and elegant Highland Park mom.
Lauren?

ALICIA

LAUREN YOST
Look at you. I love your hair.
Phil and I are here doing some
estate planning. What about you?
ALICIA
I work here.
LAUREN YOST
You’re kidding!
That’s great.
You know, Jeanie asks all the time
about your Gracie: “When are we
gonna’ get together again?” And I
keep saying “We’ve got to call.”
ALICIA
That would be great.
LAUREN YOST
So let’s do it. Okay?
too long.

It’s been

21.
And Lauren starts off.

Alicia turns, sees Kalinda smiling.

KALINDA
Let me guess. “Too long” means
right after your husband’s press
conference?
Alicia nods.

Kalinda chuckles knowingly:

KALINDA (CONT’D)
My job would be a hell of a lot harder
if people weren’t so predictable.
INT/EXT - DEPAUL UNIVERSITY - DAY
A lecture hall, class over, students rushing out. Alicia
questions DR. DOWNING (55), a dignified grey-bearded prof.
DR. DOWNING
That’s right. I was the jury foreman.
ALICIA
And you don’t mind answering a few
questions, Professor? It helps us
refine our case for the retrial.
DR. DOWNING
No, certainly. But I don’t think
you’ll need much refining. Your
case was very strong, very logical.
Good.

Alicia, taking notes, follows him into the hall...
DR. DOWNING (CONT’D)
In fact, I’m not even sure why the
other side went to trial. I voted
for conviction right from the start.
ALICIA
Good, I just-(looks up)
You mean, acquittal.
No.

DR. DOWNING
Conviction.

ALICIA
(pauses, hesitates)
But, I’m with the defense.
Dr. Downing suddenly stops.
Oh.

Stares at her.

DR. DOWNING

22.
And he continues off.

Alicia frowns: shit.

And--

INT. CHICAGO MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
--Alicia, more nervous now, interviews a MUSEUM CURATOR (34),
intelligent, pretty, backing up from a large canvas being hung.
ALICIA
You were a “guilty” vote?
CURATOR
Yes. I mean, it was pretty obvious
she did it. Sorry.
(to the workers)
To the left more.
ALICIA
So can you tell me how many voted
for conviction right from the start?
Eleven.
What?

CURATOR
ALICIA

CURATOR
Eleven. There was just one holdout. Juror #9. We argued with her
for three whole days.
INT. CHICAGO LIBRARY - DAY
ALICIA
But the judge polled the jury, and
you deadlocked six to six.
Alicia now interviewing a wispy MALE LIBRARIAN, pushing books
through the stacks, whispering:
LIBRARIAN
Yes, well, the judge was only going
to declare us deadlocked if we
evenly split, so some of us agreed
to change our votes to “not guilty”
just to get out of there.
(Alicia stares at him: uh-oh)
If it weren’t for Juror #9, we
would’ve convicted. She didn’t
convince us, she exhausted us.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
A worried Alicia talks with Kalinda on her cell:

23.
ALICIA
I’m checking her out now.
She’s
the only reason Jennifer isn’t
facing 30 to life.
KALINDA (O.S.)
Get her details: age, employment,
college level. We can gear jury
selection to her type.
Alicia nods and...
INT. MRS. DURETSKY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Cats. Everywhere. In a small apartment.
them as she calls into the kitchen:

Alicia stares at

ALICIA
No tea for me, Mrs. Duretsky. So
the other jurors said you were the
only hold out? Is that correct?
MRS. DURETSKY (65) enters. In a mumu. Doesn’t inspire a lot
of confidence, pouring milk into various plates.
MRS. DURETSKY
Yes. They all thought they were so
much smarter than me. But my vote
counted just as much as theirs.
ALICIA
Uh-huh. Can you tell me exactly what
in the defense’s case convinced you?
MRS. DURETSKY
Well... the whole thing really. I
tend to look at people and size
them up pretty quickly. That lady-I liked her.
ALICIA
The defendant: Jennifer?
MRS. DURETSKY
No, no, the lawyer. She never put
on airs. I liked that.
Alicia studies her-- a twinge of “uh-oh.”
ALICIA
The defense lawyer argued the police
never pursued the actual carjacker-was that the reason you voted “not
guilty?”

24.

What?

MRS. DURETSKY

ALICIA
She presented evidence the police
never pursued a carjacker. Was
that what made you hold out?
MRS. DURETSKY
Oh, I don’t know about that.
just tend to get a feeling.
(lifts a cat)
Don’t I, Mrs. Pringles?
Alicia stares at her.

I

Oh fuckin’ shit.

INT. ALICIA’S MERCEDES - NIGHT
Alicia. She sits depressed in her dusty Mercedes, staring
straight ahead. Parked in the building’s antiseptic and
bright underground garage. She takes out...
...Jennifer’s mugshot, looks at it. Damn. When... “Bitch is
Back” plays. She sighs. Her mother-in-law. Answering...
Hello?

ALICIA
What’s wrong, Jackie?

Alicia listens, but she hears laughter, looks up, sees...
...Will and a sexy 26-year-old PARALEGAL laughing intimately,
heading home, stopping right in front of her windshield. Um,
Alicia slumps down in her seat, trying not to be seen. Not
sure why she cares, but she does. Quieter...
ALICIA (CONT’D)
Look, Jackie, she’s at a new school.
She’s left all her old friends. I
just need you to go easier on Grace.
INTERCUT with...
INT. KITCHEN - ALICIA’S APARTMENT - DAY
...JACKIE FOLLICK (65), her mother-in-law. A blue blood
unstoppable force of nature. An Ike-era widow. Always
elegant, always domineering. Unpacking packing boxes...
JACKIE
All I said was: I could help her
shop for pants that would make her
look slimmer, that’s all.
Alicia closes her eyes.

Dammit.

25.
ALICIA
Grace is at a perfectly healthy
weight right now, and I don’t want
her to have any body image issues.
JACKIE
She’ll only have “body image
issues” if she keeps gaining
weight.
Alicia silently screams “Fuck you” at her phone when...
Alicia?

WILL

Oops. A smiling Will peering toward her. Hey. Alicia waves
weakly. Will motions for the Paralegal to go on ahead,
starts up to her window...
ALICIA
Look, I have to go, Jackie. Let’s
talk about this when I get home.
And she hangs up as Will arrives...
WILL
Hey.
So I heard the bail hearing
went well. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yeah.

ALICIA

WILL
You heading home?

ALICIA
I am.
(something on her mind)
Will, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Alicia smiles.

WILL
It’s my real hair.
Two old friends.

ALICIA
You know the new associate Cary?
WILL
The one in the Brioni?
(Alicia shoots him a look)
What? I’m observant.

26.
ALICIA
Yes, the one in the Brioni. He
said “Let the best associate win.”
What’s he mean by that?
Will frowns, shrugs:
WILL
What he means is something I
thought we weren’t making public.
What?

ALICIA

WILL
We only have one associate position
open. We agreed to hire two
applicants, and in six months
decide which one to retain.
ALICIA
So it’s a contest?

Me or Cary?

WILL
It was that or a cage match.
(smiles)
I’m just glad your pro bono’s going
well.
ALICIA
(forces a smile)
Me too.
EXT. TAMMS MINIMUM SECURITY UNIT - (NEXT DAY) - DAY
A prison.

Trees.

Grass.

More Club Fed than Folsom.

INT. VISITORS SECURITY VESTIBULE - DAY
Alicia waits. We’re not sure why she’s here: a prison waiting
area. She looks down at the leather binder in her lap. The
one word there: “Goals.” She clicks her pen, writes under it
one word... “Survive.” Nods. Sounds about right.
GUARD
Visiting hours are almost over.
She looks up.

A GUARD waiting.

INT. VISITING AREA - TAMMA MINIMUM SECURITY - DUSK
He escorts her toward the cafeteria-like visiting area.
Families with loved ones. Only one prisoner not being
visited. He sees her and...

27.
...smiles. David. Oh, that’s why she’s here. We recognize
him from the press conference. He looks good, wearing his
uniform like a three-piece suit. Still handsome, impressive.
DAVID FOLLICK
They said a visitor, but I thought Mom.
ALICIA
I’ve been busy.
DAVID FOLLICK
It’s good to see you.
He reaches out, awkwardly hugs her.

She nods, stiff.

ALICIA
I need you to sign some things.
Oh.

David nods, moderately disappointed.

Business.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
We didn’t get everything we wanted
on the house. It’s a bad time to
sell.
DAVID FOLLICK
(sees the number: ouch)
I see that.
ALICIA
Most of it will go to court costs.
We’ll pay for rent out of my salary,
and the kids will have to stay in
public school.
DAVID FOLLICK
How are they? Mom says she’s
helping out around the house.
Alicia digs into her purse as David signs:
ALICIA
They’re good. Grace is fighting
your mother over clothes. And Zach
is using you to make friends at
school-- I’m not sure if that’s a
sign of health or something worse.
DAVID FOLLICK
He’s “using me?”
ALICIA
“Funny or Die” has a skit about
you. I guess it’s cool. Here.

They sit.

28.
Alicia slides some photos across to David.
Grace and Zach. Touched:
Thanks.

He looks at them.

DAVID FOLLICK

He reaches a hand across, covers hers.

She pulls away.

DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
I know it’s been hard, Alicia. You
have to believe me, I’m innocent.
(She looks up: are you
fucking kidding me?)
--of the abuse of office charges.
ALICIA
(getting quieter)
You think I give a good goddamn
about that, David? There’s a tape
of you sucking the toes of a 20year-old hooker playing in Grace’s
computer lab, and you think I care
about the small print in your
employment contract!
DAVID FOLLICK
I was set up, Alicia! The D.A. set
me up--!
ALICIA
Oh, stop it, David! Just--!
No. Look, I’m not here to fight.
She collects the papers.
wanting her to go.

Starts to stand.

David, not

DAVID FOLLICK
Mom said you’re on your first case.
Congratulations. The Combs case,
right? Who’s the judge?
ALICIA
Colin Bogira.
DAVID FOLLICK
You’re kidding. He hates me.
I know.

ALICIA

DAVID FOLLICK
Wear something revealing. He has a
thing for the ladies. That black
dress I got you in Houston, wear that.

29.
Alicia looks at him, shakes her head, chuckles. He’s amazing.
An intercom blares: “Visiting hours have now concluded.”
DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
(delaying her)
You know there was something weird
about that case: the Combs case.
There was a rumor going around that
something got buried: “pitted.”
Alicia pauses.
What?

Can’t help it.
ALICIA

David takes a moment to think as families pass, leaving.
DAVID FOLLICK
I don’t know. Something important.
Evidence or testimony.
Alicia considers it, sees a guard approach.
ALICIA
I should go.
DAVID FOLLICK
Thanks for playing the bread-winner
for a while, Alicia. I know you’re
not really built for this stuff.
Alicia looks up at him.
which makes it worse.

He didn’t even mean it as an insult--

DAVID FOLLICK (CONT’D)
It won’t last forever. Ryan thinks
if this appeal goes well, I should
be out in a year. Then things can
go back to normal.
Alicia stares at him.

Sees the guard waiting.

ALICIA
You know what, David? It took me a
decade to realize it. But I am
built for this stuff. And we’re
never going back to normal.
And, with that, Alicia falls in beside the guard, starting
away. With each step, we see it on Alicia’s face. A growing
determination.
END OF ACT ONE

30.
ACT TWO
EXT. WESTERFIELD DRIVE - CHICAGO - (DAYS LATER) - DAY
Alicia.

A new side to her.

Passion.

Arguing with Kalinda:

ALICIA
Look, the cops focused on Jennifer
even before they did a chemical
analysis of the trace evidence; so
what if they only did an analysis
of what fit their theory?
Kalinda snaps photos of the crime scene: a windswept
industrial road beside Lake Michigan.
KALINDA
And what if they didn’t? What if-(Alicia holds up a paper)
Okay, what’s that?
ALICIA
Page one of the crime lab summary.
I was digging through the
discovery. Look at the top corner.
Kalinda leans in, sees a Xeroxed slanted line.
KALINDA
Looks like a staple.
ALICIA
It is a staple.
KALINDA
And that’s odd because?
ALICIA
There was no page two.
(Kalinda looks at her)
Why did they need a staple if there
was no page two?
KALINDA
(takes a second)
You think they kept page two out of
the discovery because there was
something incriminating?
ALICIA
I think either they did, or it
would be helpful in court to imply
they did.

31.
Kalinda eyes Alicia.

A new Alicia.

Liking this version.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
Look, Jennifer’s innocent, but if
we can get her off on a process
question, that’s still justice.
KALINDA
So just so I’m clear: we’re a day
away from trial and you’re thinking
of dropping the old strategy?
ALICIA
Dawna barely convinced a cat lady
to acquit. So, yes.
KALINDA
(takes the lab report)
Okay. I’ll check into it.
Alicia nods: good.

They turn to the Walmart parking lot.

KALINDA (CONT’D)
So a pick-up truck is crossing a welllit, empty parking lot and for some
reason Jennifer’s disorientated, and
thinks it’s coming not from that
direction, but that direction.
They compare the views.

Nothing alike.

ALICIA
I don’t believe it.
KALINDA
Me neither. So how is a truck
missed by that surveillance camera?
A camera on the side of the Walmart.

Alicia shrugs:

ALICIA
Mismarked surveillance tape?
Kalinda looks at her, considers it. Interesting. She
crosses to her car, takes off her jacket, drops it inside,
unbuttons the two top buttons of her blouse. Preparing.
ALICIA (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
KALINDA
Working. These are better than
subpoenas.

32.
Alicia smiles.
INT. WALMART SALES FLOOR - DAY
The security guard. MITCHELL (40). Tall, skinny, reads
SOLDIER OF FORTUNE for the articles. He looks at Kalinda and
her breasts, trying not to look at Kalinda and her breasts:
KALINDA
We just need to see how the
surveillance system works, and we’ll
be out of your hair in five minutes.
Alicia glances at Kalinda.

She’s good.

Turning it on.

MITCHELL
Five minutes?
She nods. Okay, Mitchell starts up his office stairs, waves
for them to follow. Alicia looks over at Kalinda impressed:
ALICIA
Why did my husband fire you?
KALINDA
He accused me of working two jobs.
Were you?
Oh yeah.
Alicia smiles.

ALICIA
KALINDA

And they follow him.

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - WALMART STORE - DAY
A surveillance image of the nighttime parking lot. It plays on
Mitchell’s computer in his office overlooking the sales floor.
MITCHELL
See, the computer automatically
records the surveillance, and marks
the date and time.
KALINDA
This is the night of the murder?
MITCHELL
Yes. But even if the computer did
mismark it, I make an hourly sweep
around the lot, and I didn’t see
any pick-up. Look, that’s me-- at
11:03-- just before the murder--

33.
The surveillance image: Mitchell crossing the nighttime lot.
Kalinda and Alicia frown. A dead end.
KALINDA
Can we get copies of these?
Sure.

MITCHELL
Lanie! I need some disks!

LANIE (45), a slightly hefty secretary in the outer office.
She rolls her eyes, irritated:
Alright.

LANIE

Alicia notices this. Notices Lanie’s desk. Framed kid
photos, a “Curves” gym bag, a dozen crushed Diet Cokes in the
trash. Alicia looks toward Kalinda, getting nowhere with
Mitchell. Alicia starts out.
INT. SECURITY BREAK ROOM - DAY
Ka-lump-- she buys a Diet Coke from a vending machine; drops
in more quarters-- ka-lump-- buys another.
INT. SECRETARIAL WORKSTATION - SECURITY OFFICES - DAY
ALICIA
Hi. Your machine gave me an extra
Diet Coke. Want one?
Lanie glances up at Alicia leaning in her door:
LANIE
Aren’t you one of the lawyers?
ALICIA
I’m just helping out.

If you want.

The Coke. Lanie shrugs-- sure-- takes it. They pop the
tops, drink. Alicia nods toward her photos:
ALICIA (CONT’D)
Look at all those kids. Wow,
they’re gorgeous.
Thanks.

LANIE
Two kids.

Two grandkids.

ALICIA
I have two teenagers.
gets easier.

Tell me it

34.
LANIE
I’d be lying.
They laugh. Mitchell, hearing their laughter, slams his
office door. Alicia and Lanie trade a joking look.
ALICIA
Is he always that charming?
He’s fine.
They laugh.

LANIE
Just a lazy mall cop.

Lanie leans in, gossips:

LANIE (CONT’D)
When school’s out, and all the high
school girls come over here, mall
cop’s the first one down on the
floor, showing off his gun. But,
night shift, he can’t get his fat
ass out of his chair. I’m the
first one in in the morning, and
I’m always waking him up.
ALICIA
(studies her)
Really...?
EXT. ALICIA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A downtown apartment building. Middle class nice. Doorman.
Surrounded by a sea of traffic, sirens. On the 7th floor...
INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - ALICIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
...Alicia studies the video of the WalMart parking lot on her
computer, sipping red wine.
Her 3 bedroom apartment. It’s a bit crowded, but pretty.
Everything doing double duty: Alicia’s desk in the corner of
the dining room. A few packing boxes still unpacked. Behind
her, Jackie enters, in pearls and apron, sets the table:
JACKIE
Do you really have to work?
ALICIA
Another ten minutes.
(calls into the next room)
Zach! I need your laptop!

35.
JACKIE
When David’s father was on the
Illinois court, he never brought a
single case home. Not once.
ALICIA
He was a judge, Jackie; I’m a
junior associate. Zach!
ZACH
Mom, I just raised my wanted level.
ZACH (14) enters, upset at interrupting “Grand Theft Auto.”
A shy AV-kid trying to seem tougher than he is.
ALICIA
I’m proud of you, dear. I just
need to play two computer disks
side by side. Can you set up your
laptop next to my desktop?
Zach shrugs, starts to set them up as Alicia sees Jackie
slipping back into the kitchen.
ALICIA (CONT’D)
How’s your sister? Any more fights
with grandma?
Zach shrugs: noncommittal, but noncommittal-yes. Okay, Alicia
gets up, kisses him on the head, starts into the hall.
INT. GRACE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alicia peers into Grace’s room.

Posters of Obama everywhere.

ALICIA
How’re you doing?
GRACE
I want her dead.
ALICIA
(smiles)
Me too; but not yet. Help me out.
Which one for court tomorrow?
She holds up a black slinky dress.

Clearly David’s choice.

GRACE
Are you serving cocktails in court?
Alicia smiles.

Holds up a conservative blue pantsuit.

36.
GRACE (CONT’D)
Better. Why can’t Zach and I watch
ourselves?
ALICIA
She’s only here a couple hours a
day, Grace.
GRACE
A couple of very damaging hours.
Alicia smiles, kisses Grace on the forehead:
ALICIA
You will survive.
INT. KITCHEN - ALICIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A boiling pot of water. Pasta. Jackie cooking. A good cook.
Across the island from her, Alicia chops carrots.
JACKIE
I talked to David.
dropped by.
I did.

He said you

ALICIA

JACKIE
I’m glad. He’s hurting in there.
He’s very brave, but he’s hurting.
Alicia is silent, chopping.

Jackie looks toward her.

JACKIE (CONT’D)
He needs you to forgive him,
Alicia. I know it’s hard but he
needs it.
ALICIA
He doesn’t need that, Jackie. He
needs me to go back to who I was.
And I won’t do that.
JACKIE
What are you saying?
Alicia sets down her knife, looks at her.
ALICIA
I spent fifteen years not asking
him a single question.
(MORE)

37.
ALICIA (CONT'D)
Doing his laundry, cleaning his
house, accepting his reasons for
staying overnight in the city.
Because I loved him. Because I...
admired him. Because I didn’t want
to end up like my parents: divorced
and bitter. And he-The door opens.

It’s Grace.

She looks between the two.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
We’ll be done in a second.
Grace shrugs-- something being discussed. She grabs a piece
of bread, exits. Alicia lowers her voice:
ALICIA (CONT’D)
And he took everything I did, every
minute of our marriage, and he...
(still hurts)
...ripped it open for those cameras.
JACKIE
David didn’t want that.
ALICIA
He wanted a prop, Jackie. He
didn’t want a wife. I looked at
him at that press conference, and I
realized... I don’t know this man.
JACKIE
It takes time, Alicia.
time.

Give it

ALICIA
No, Jackie. I woke up, and I’m not
going back to sleep. If I ever
have to go through something like
that again, I want it to be because
of something I did. I’m not going
to live or die by someone else’s
mistakes.
Jackie looks at her, wants to say something, but Zach calls:
ZACH (O.S.)
Mom, I got it running.
INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - ALICIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Two identical views of the parking lot. Playing on side-byside laptop and desktop screens. Alicia and Zach watch.

38.
ZACH
What is it?
ALICIA
Video from the night of the murder.
ZACH
Cool, like “Faces of Death.”
Alicia glances over, sees Zach studying grisly autopsy
photos. She reaches over, slaps the file closed. Zach
shrugs, nods toward the screens.
ZACH (CONT’D)
What are you looking for?
ALICIA
I’m not-- [sure]
But something catches Alicia’s eye.
Zach.

On the laptop.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
Can you freeze it? There.

He clicks a key. Alicia leans in toward the frozen image,
studying a small plastic shopping bag blowing across the lot.
Suddenly excited.
What?

ZACH
What is it?

Proof.
Of what?

ALICIA
ZACH

ALICIA
Mall cop wasn’t there.
EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - (THE NEXT DAY) - DAY
A sunny day.

Leaves falling from the trees.

And...

INT. HALLWAY - COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
...Kalinda rushes toward court, passing a herd of lawyers:
LAWYER
How’s Mrs. D.A. doing?
Kalinda offers a shrug as she pushes into...

39.
INT. COURTROOM 402 - COOK CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
...court. Bogira on the bench. Jury seated. A dozen court
watchers. Kalinda joins them in the gallery, eyes Alicia and
Jennifer at the defense table.
MATAN
And you were married to the victim
for how long, Mrs. Combs?
The first witness on the stand. CINDY COMBS (30).
dressed. Pretty, but not botoxed.
Two years.

Plainly-

CINDY
Until...

Her voice cracks. Matan gently sets a Kleenex box in front
of her as Alicia checks the jury. They seem moved. Not a
cat lady in sight. Damn.
MATAN
How did you hear of his murder, if
you don’t mind me asking?
CINDY
I was visiting my family in Miami,
and the police phoned. It was-- I
still can’t believe it.
MATAN
In her opening statement, the
defense alleged that your husband
was intending to reunite with the
accused-- that in fact that’s why
they were going to dinner the night
of the murder. Is that true?
CINDY
No. She told him she wanted to
talk over the custody situation.
Michael was worried about Jennifer.
He thought she was... obsessed-ALICIA
Objection, your honor.
JUDGE BOGIRA
On what grounds?
ALICIA
(hesitates a second)
“Hearsay?”

40.
JUDGE BOGIRA
Nice try, Mrs. Follick.

I’ll allow.

Alicia frowns. Smooths her collar. Maybe the blue
conservative pantsuit was a mistake. She sits, sees
Jennifer’s worried expression. Nods comfortingly to her.
CINDY
Michael agreed to have dinner with
Jennifer because he was afraid of
what she might do if he didn’t.
MATAN
Thank you, Mrs. Combs.

Your witness.

Alicia stands, bumps her knee-- oww-- backs away from the
table, covering for it. Nervous:
ALICIA
Now, Mrs. Combs, you stated that
Michael wasn’t considering
reuniting with Jennifer, and yet-Objection.
Sustained.
Alicia pauses.

MATAN
JUDGE BOGIRA

Isn’t sure what she did wrong.

ALICIA
In your testimony, Mrs. Combs, you
claim that Michael thought my
client was dangerous, but isn’t it-Objection.

MATAN

JUDGE BOGIRA
Sustained. Keep trying, Mrs.
Follick. You’ll hit on it.
ALICIA
I-- Mrs. Combs. Isn’t it true
your husband changed his mind about
fighting my client for custody of
their daughter?
Yes.

CINDY

41.
ALICIA
Wouldn’t that suggest your
husband’s attitude had softened--?
Objection.
Sustained.

MATAN
JUDGE BOGIRA

Alicia starts to ask more, decides against it:
Thank you.

ALICIA

An uncertain Alicia sits, offers a smile to a nervous Jennifer
worrying this isn’t going well. Matan and Sandra, meanwhile,
try to swallow their grins. A bailiff hands a note to Alicia.
She opens it, reads: “Calm down.” Alicia turns to the
gallery, nods to Kalinda.
And...
INT. COURTROOM 402 - ONE HOUR LATER - DAY
A police detective.

BRIGGS (45).

Dudley-Do-Right upstanding.

SANDRA PAI
And why was this carjacking not like
the other three, Detective Briggs?
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
Well, there was no clip on the fuel
line to force the car over.
SANDRA PAI
This was a detail kept from the press?
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
Well, we didn’t intentionally keep
it out, but someone imitating the
carjackings wouldn’t know to do it.
SANDRA PAI
Instead, the victim pulled the car
over because he had a flat?
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
Yes, ma’am. A nail had been driven
into the rear passenger wheel.
SANDRA PAI
I see. Now why is this something a
carjacker would never do, detective?

42.
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
Well, it sort of defeats the whole
purpose. I mean, how do you steal
a car with a flat?
Alicia shoots a look toward the jury, all intently making
notes on their pads: obviously a good point. Damn. Jennifer
leans toward Alicia, whispers:
JENNIFER COMBS
It’s not going well, is it?
ALICIA
(whispers back)
It’s early.
SANDRA PAI
Your witness.
Alicia stands.

Takes a moment.

Calms herself.

ALICIA
Detective Briggs, what is “the pit”?
Matan and Pai look immediately up from taking notes: huh?
Excuse me?

DETECTIVE BRIGGS

ALICIA
In police circles, what is “the pit”?
MATAN
Objection, your honor?
JUDGE BOGIRA
On what grounds?
MATAN
On the grounds that... relevance.
JUDGE BOGIRA
Well, let us see how relevant this
becomes, shall we? Detective.
Kalinda, in the galley, leans forward, nods-- good-- as
Briggs clears his throat, not happy with this:
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
The pit? The pit is police slang
for evidence that is thought
irrelevant to a crime scene.

43.
ALICIA
And when an officer is referring to
“dropping something in the pit” or
“pitting it” he refers to what?
DETECTIVE BRIGGS
Excluding it from the crime scene
narrative. But this is only the
case with irrelevant details. We
never exclude pertinent evidence.
ALICIA
Was anything from the Combs crime
scene pitted?
MATAN
Your honor, objection!
INT. JUDGE BOGIRA’S CHAMBERS - DAY
In chambers. A wall of words. Matan and Pai yelling.
Bogira studies the xeroxed staple on the lab report.

As

JUDGE BOGIRA
Okay, okay. So, Mrs. Follick, none
of this was in the first trial. Is
it your intention to pursue a new
defense?
ALICIA
Yes, your honor.
Bogira eyes Alicia, steelier than he thought as Matan explodes:
MATAN
Counsel is trying to mislead the jury
with a claim of police corruption--!
JUDGE BOGIRA
Oh, shut up, Matan. Is she right?
That’s the question. Did you bury
something?
MATAN
I-- We all know what’s going on
here. David Follick was a corrupt
D.A. If evidence was buried, he
buried it; and now she’s benefiting
from his knowledge!
JUDGE BOGIRA
Which still leaves you with a
possible second page missing here!
(MORE)

44.
JUDGE BOGIRA (CONT'D)
I’ll give you until Monday to
produce it, along with any evidence
it references, then I’ll rule on
admissability. And you, Mrs.
Follick, I’m not sure if you’re
being fed this stuff or you’re doing
it on your own, but I’m not going to
allow a fishing expedition in my
court. Understand?
ALICIA
I do, your honor.
JUDGE BOGIRA
You seem to be learning quick, Mrs.
Follick, congratulations. But
you’ll find there’s only one rule in
trial work. Don’t waste the judge’s
time. Are you wasting my time?
ALICIA
Never, your honor.
END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. DAWNA’S CORNER OFFICE - 28TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
Tense. Alicia stands before the partners: Dawna, Will, and a
Solomonic Cormac. Door closed.
DAWNA
The directive was simple: follow the
strategy of the first trial. Instead
you’re pushing for trace evidence
that might not even help your case.
Alicia tries to stay strong, certain:
ALICIA
I interviewed the first jury and they
voted 11 to one to convict, so I-DAWNA
Excuse me, that’s not true.

It was

ALICIA
No. Half the jurors switched votes
only when they couldn’t get a
“troubled” juror to deliberate.

So it was my judgement to change
strategies.

She studies Alicia.

Angrily.

A personal slap.

DAWNA
Was it your judgment not to update us?

Alicia!
Alicia sighs.

Looks at her hand.

ALICIA

An approaching Lauren Yost.

LAUREN YOST
We’ve gotta stop meeting like this.
(laughs)
ALICIA
Hey, Lauren.
Alicia starts off, but Lauren follows...

Hates

46.
LAUREN YOST
We’re just finishing up the estate
documents today. But you know who
I ran into downtown? Deena Hart.
I told her I saw you, and she said
she was going to give you a call so
the three of us could have lunch.
ALICIA
Lauren, I don’t mean to be rude,
but... Deena isn’t going to call,
and we’re not going to have lunch.
And that’s fine. Really, it is.
Lauren stares at her.

The honesty of this pretty blinding.

ALICIA (CONT’D)
Everybody’s moved on. It’s not a
good or bad thing. It’s just what
happens. It’s great to see you. I
have to get back to work.
And Alicia continues off. Lauren watches her go: the
smallest edge of guilt there. While...
INT. DAWNA’S CORNER OFFICE - 28TH FLOOR - LAW FIRM - DAY
...the partners deliberate...
DAWNA
She’s a junior associate who
doesn’t think she’s a junior
associate. Her husband was the
D.A., she lived in Highland Park.
It’s not just trying to teach an
old dog new tricks. It’s trying to
teach an entitled dog new tricks.
WILL
Oh, come on, Dawna. She’s trying
to win a case. You mentor these
women until they start competing
with you.
What?!

DAWNA
Excuse me?!

CORMAC
Okay, okay. What are your
recommendations?
DAWNA
I think we should reprimand Alicia,
and put Cary in as first chair.

47.
Cormac turns to Will: You?

Will considers it.

WILL
You know one thing we haven’t
talked about? What if there is
something in this missing trace
evidence?
And...
INT. CRIME LAB - DAY
KALINDA
Just a peek, Danny.

Come on.

It’s Kalinda smiling flirtatiously with DANNY (32), a nervous
Wallace Shawn type, outside the crime lab. Kalinda dressed
to accentuate everything that needs to be accentuated.
No.

DANNY
How’d you even get in here?

KALINDA
I still have friends in the D.A.’s
office. Come on, I know the judge
ordered you to look through the raw
Combs evidence. What’d you find?
Danny stares at her, and...
INT. DANNY’S WORKSTATION - CRIME LAB - DAY
Hairs.

DANNY
Brown. A half inch long.

Danny whispers nervously as Kalinda peers through a microscope.
KALINDA
Pubic hairs?
No.

DANNY
Not curled.

Don’t touch that.

KALINDA
And you checked their residences?
DANNY
There were no matching hairs in the
accused or victim’s house. Now you
have to go. Please.
KALINDA
Where were these found?

48.
Danny sighs, checks a report:
DANNY
On the deceased.

His left coat arm.

KALINDA
(incredulous)
And the cops think this is
immaterial to the case?! They’re
found on the arm used by a driver to
struggle with a carjacker, and--?
DANNY
These didn’t come from any carjacker.
KALINDA
How do you know?
DANNY
They’re not human.
Kalinda.

She stares at him.

What?

INT. ALICIA’S OFFICE - DAY
Jennifer. She hungrily flips through new photos of Lilly, now
a year older. She laughs at her in a witch costume.
Thank you.

JENNIFER COMBS
Thank you.

Alicia, still distracted, nods, smiles. Standing in her office
now stacked high with files and exhibits. Still no filing
cabinets. A phone rings out at the secretarial workstation.
JENNIFER COMBS (CONT’D)
That’s her. Isn’t it?
ALICIA
Sonia, can you send it in?
But the phone still rings.

Alicia leans out her door, finds...

INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - DAY
...Sonia gone-- in the conference room across the hall,
taking notes on Cary’s deposition. Shit. Alicia answers it:

Hello.

LILLY COMBS (O.S.)

Jennifer breaks down, crying.

Hearing her daughter’s voice.

JENNIFER COMBS
Baby, it’s me.
Alicia at the door finds her eyes wet too.

Can’t help it.

LILLY COMBS (O.S.)
Where are you, mommy? I miss you
so much.
JENNIFER COMBS
I know, I miss you too. I just-- I
hope I can see you. I want to see

LILLY COMBS (O.S.)
I want to see you too.
Alicia wipes a tear from her cheek, slowly...
INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - DAY
...steps out, quietly closing the door.
rolling a FILING CABINET toward her.
Oh, good.

She sees Sonia

ALICIA
I’m overflowing in here.

SONIA
Actually, Mrs. Follick... ah...
She wheels it into Cary’s tidy office.
Alicia’s frustration bubbles over:

Oh, come on!

ALICIA
We need to talk, Sonia.
SONIA
I know. I just-- I have to get
back to the deposition.

50.
ALICIA
No, stop. You’re both our
assistants. You’re not just
working for Cary.
SONIA
I know, Mrs. Follick, but I need
this job, and Cary...
(trying to be polite)
...he’s definitely going to be
here. I’m sorry.
And she rushes off.

Alicia just stands there, when...

KALINDA
It’s not human.
Alicia turns to find Kalinda approaching.

What?

KALINDA (CONT’D)
The trace evidence. It’s hair from
an Italian greyhound. Neither
Jennifer or Michael had pets. And
here’s something else. There’s a
chemical on the hair. Alco ectolin.
A lotion for muscle and joint pain.
ALICIA
(peering at her notes)
That’s the chemical number?
KALINDA
No, his cell. I agreed to drinks.
Alicia looks up, smiles.

Starting to love Kalinda.

ALICIA
So we’re looking for a greyhoundowning senior citizen?
KALINDA
“We”? I hear you’re being bumped
to second chair.
Alicia stares at Kalinda. A surprise. She looks around.
Sees the Assistant Brian nearby. They lower their voices:
When?

ALICIA

KALINDA
Tomorrow. Cary’s being
transitioned in. They go back to
the first strategy.

51.
Alicia takes a second.

Considers it.

ALICIA
Then that leaves today.
Kalinda nods.

A moment between them.

KALINDA
So go kill him.
INT. COURTROOM 402 - COOK CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
The Walmart surveillance.

It plays on a courtroom monitor.

MATAN
This is at 11:03, the night of the
murder, Mr. Mitchell. And that’s
you crossing the lot, correct?
The Walmart security guard, looking crisp, professional.
MITCHELL
Yes, sir, that is correct. It’s
part of my job to make a circuit of
the lot every hour on the hour.
Alicia (wearing the black dress now-- whatever it takes)
checks how Jennifer is doing. She looks down at the photos
of Lilly in her hand, still glowing.
MATAN
And you saw no mysterious pick-up
truck? No evil carjackers racing
past you? Nothing the defendant
claims she saw? Correct?
MITCHELL
That’s correct.
Will enters the gallery, sits behind Kalinda.

Whispers:

WILL
How’s it going?
KALINDA
Can’t tell yet. If we undercut him,
we’re halfway home. But we still
have to throw together a defense.
Will nods, sees a man at the back of the court.

Interesting.
examination.

Will turns back to Alicia now standing for crossA bailiff wheels two monitors next to the first.

ALICIA
Thank you. Now, Mr. Mitchell, we
have three images here. The middle
one is the night of the murder. The
left is the surveillance from the
night before the murder. And the
right is the surveillance from the
night after the murder. Correct?
Can you see the dates on all three?
MITCHELL
Yes, I can. That’s correct.
ALICIA
Good. And, as you said before, here
you are-- let me roll these forward a
bit-- here you are crossing the lot
at 11:03 on the night of the murder?
And here you are...
But Alicia pauses, sees Greg Childs.

Eyeing her.

A long second.

JUDGE BOGIRA
Mrs. Follick?
Alicia nods, continues.

More intent, biting into it:

ALICIA
And here you are, Mr. Mitchell,
doing the same the night before and
the night after the murder. Making
a circuit of the parking lot. It
must get old?
MITCHELL
No, ma’am. My job may not pay as
much as yours, but I love it.
Matan and Sandra watch Alicia.

Where is she going with this?

ALICIA
Okay, now let’s fast-forward the
image another forty-five minutes,
shall we? There. What do you see?

53.

Nothing.
No, there.
Oh.

MITCHELL
ALICIA
Do you need to move closer?

MITCHELL
It looks like a shopping bag.

ALICIA
Actually it is. A plastic shopping
bag. It was windy that night. And
it blew across the lot at 11:48.
MATAN
Your honor, objection, what does
this have to do with anything?
JUDGE BOGIRA
Beats me. But I’m interested.
Aren’t you, Mr. Brody? Overruled.
ALICIA
Now let me fast-forward these other
two monitors-- the night before the
murder and the night after-- to the
same time code.
She does so, and-- click-- she freeze-frames all three. And
there it is-- the same plastic bag blowing across the lot.
ALICIA (CONT’D)
What do you see?
MITCHELL
(appalled)
I-- I don’t know.
ALICIA
I think you do know, sir. Either you
have a plastic bag that blows across
your lot every night at 11:48 or
these are copies of the same tape.
Matan and Sandra close their eyes: oh shit. As Judge Bogira
suppresses an appreciative snort, and the jury all
immediately turn to make a note on their pads.
Will’s grin widens as Alicia clicks “play” on the three
monitors. And the exact same bag blows across the lot.
I didn’t-like!

MITCHELL
It’s not what it looks

54.
ALICIA
I understand, sir. It’s not that
you willfully misled the police?
MITCHELL
No, right-- correct.
ALICIA
It’s just that it’s cold out at
night? And sometimes you don’t
make the circuit of the lot?
MITCHELL

Yes.

ALICIA
So, on nights you don’t go out, you
don’t record the actual
surveillance image; you just set
your computer to duplicate the
night before in case the manager
checks it, is that correct?
I--

Yes.

MITCHELL

Will grins, looks back, sees D.A. Childs exiting unhappily.
ALICIA
So just to be clear: there is no
recording of the night of the
murder, and you were never in a
position to see or not see a pickup truck with carjackers?
(Mitchell nods, destroyed)
Was that a yes, sir?
I’m sorry.

MITCHELL
Yes.

Jennifer takes a deep breath.

The truth.

ALICIA
No further questions.
Matan and Sandra just stare straight ahead, destroyed. As
Alicia turns toward her seat, looks for Greg Childs. He’s
gone. Alicia nods-- good-- then she sees Will, smiling.
She offers a quick smile back, sits. Pats an appreciative
Jennifer’s hand. Better than therapy.
END OF ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. ALICIA’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Will and Alicia. Late night bull session. Alicia’s office
is an ever-growing chaos of files. Still no filing cabinets.
WILL
So, you’ve got no rebuttal witnesses?
ALICIA
Just Jennifer.
WILL
And you’re wondering whether
demolishing the key prosecution
witness didn’t just save your ass
as first chair-- congratulations,
by the way-(Alicia smiles, nods)
--but was enough for reasonable doubt?
Alicia nods.

A second of silence as they think.

WILL (CONT’D)
You know what I don’t like?
ALICIA
The nail in the tire?
WILL
Yeah. And the old Honda. It just
doesn’t feel like a carjacking. It
feels like a murder made to look like
a carjacking. Is that a couch?
A couch standing on its end in a corner.
ALICIA
Yeah, maintenance brought it by.
Go for it.
Will lowers the couch.

Jumps on it.

Looks around.

WILL
You need a maid in here.
But Alicia pauses, a new thought nudging her.
ALICIA
Okay, what if it wasn’t a carjacking?
WILL
Then you lose.

56.
ALICIA
No, no, what if we don’t argue
against their case. We agree it was
a murder made to look like a
carjacking-- but Jennifer just
wasn’t the one who did it?
WILL
Sounds like you’re reinventing the
wheel.
ALICIA
(getting excited)
No, all they’ve proven is it wasn’t
a carjacking, not that Jennifer was
the shooter. I need to offer up
another suspect. Who are Michael’s
enemies? Who would want him dead?
Alicia finds a number, dials, sees Sonia pausing at the door:
SONIA
Hi. I just wanted to say:
congratulations, Mrs. Follick.

ALICIA

Sonia starts to say more when Cary calls: “Sonia!” She
smiles, embarrassed, starts off. Will shoots a look toward
Alicia-- what was that about? She shakes her head-- nothing.
ALICIA (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Yeah, hey, Kalinda. What do we
know about the victim’s enemies?
No, it just seems like we need to
point to a suspect.
Will gets up, whispers:

Alicia nods, regretfully. Watches Will leave. He looks good
from this angle. Sexy. He turns the corner. Gone.

No, look, let’s talk to the wife-Cindy-- ask if he had any money

ALICIA (CONT'D)
No, the thing is: we don’t need a

Bright and beautiful.

INT. HALLWAY - COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
Kalinda and Alicia exit a courthouse elevator, hurriedly walk
and talk their way through documents as they head toward court:
KALINDA
That’s from the TRW; and that’s the
family history.
ALICIA
Where are the credit card receipts?
KALINDA
Here. But they’re going to object
the whole way. You’ll need to just
string together some implications-GREG CHILDS
Mrs. Follick, do you have a moment?
They both stop, see a stone-faced D.A. Childs in their path.
I-- sure.

Alicia nods to a reluctant Kalinda: go ahead. Kalinda knits
her brow: you sure? Alicia nods. Kalinda continues off.
GREG CHILDS
I don’t think we’ve ever met.
Greg Childs.
We’ve met.

I’m

ALICIA

Alicia not smiling, not offering a hand. Okay, no
pleasantries. Childs looks around: no one within ear-shot.
Time for the adults to talk.
GREG CHILDS
You know he’s using you, don’t you?
David blames me for his downfall.
He thinks I set him up. He’s using
you to get to me.
ALICIA
How do you figure?

58.
GREG CHILDS
Mrs. Follick, please. He told you
about the missing trace evidence.
He told you about “the pit.”
(Alicia smiles)
Don’t make yourself collateral
damage here. For your own sake.
ALICIA
Mr. Childs. The day you leaked that
sex tape to the press, and forced me
to shield my kids from every cable
news station playing it in 24-hour
rotation-- that was the day I became
collateral damage. You think you
have to worry about my husband, Mr.
Childs? You’ve obviously never made
a woman angry before.
(smiles politely)
But good luck in court.
And Alicia starts away confidently.

Childs watches her go.

INT. COURTROOM 402 - COOK CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
Cindy Combs back on the stand. Still pale, a pained woman.
Alicia approaches, smiling, wind at her back from the Childs
talk. Plop-- she slaps the Kleenex box in front of her.
ALICIA
Mrs. Combs. Did you and the deceased
sign a pre-nuptial agreement?
A--?

Yes.

JUDGE BOGIRA
Move it along, Mrs.

ALICIA
Mrs. Combs, as you testified
earlier, you were in Miami at the
time of the shooting, visiting
family. So the police never
suspected or questioned you?
CINDY
Of the murder? No, of course not.
ALICIA
What about your brother?
Matan jumps to his feet:
MATAN
Objection, your honor! Come on!
This whole line of questioning is a
smoke screen!
JUDGE BOGIRA
Mr. Brody, why don’t we wait for a
whiff of smoke before we call it a
screen, please. I’ll allow.
ALICIA
The police never questioned your
brother, isn’t that correct, Mrs.
Combs?
Cindy frowns. This is not going to a good place. Detective
Briggs, meanwhile, in the gallery, watches, curious.
CINDY
There was no reason to question him.
ALICIA
Because he lives in Miami?
CINDY
Because Danny had nothing to do
with this!
Alicia shoots a look toward the jury: Cindy’s new abrasive
tone not going over well. Jennifer, meanwhile, watches
confused: where’s Alicia going with this?
ALICIA
Mrs. Combs, the judge has admitted
into evidence the buried-(MORE)

60.
ALICIA (CONT'D)
(sees Matan jumping up)
--strike that-- the “previously
unreleased” trace evidence. He has
also admitted into evidence the
crime lab’s finding that these
greyhound hairs were covered with a
chemical compound called alco
ectolin.” Have you heard of this?
CINDY
The chemical? No.
ALICIA
Well, neither had I. It turns out,
it is a lotion. A lotion used at
dog racing tracks to ease-Objection.

MATAN
Not in evidence.

JUDGE BOGIRA
Sustained. You might want to stay
standing, Mr. Brody. I have a feeling
we’re nearing your smoke screen.
Detective Briggs leans forward in his seat listening as...
Alicia gives herself a second, slows it down, makes the words

Detective Briggs gets up, starts out of court.
INT. ALICIA’S OFFICE - DAY
Alicia and Kalinda sit in her office, feet up.
Still no filing cabinets. Quiet.

Still a mess.

ALICIA
So if they come back today?
KALINDA
It’s “guilty.” Guilty verdicts
come fast. “Not guilty” verdicts
come slow.
ALICIA
So I’ll be optimistic, and take a nap.
They both sit back, relax, feet up on the desk. Kalinda sees
Alicia’s laptop: the screen saver playing old family vacation
photos. One of David, smiling, swim-suited. A happier time.
KALINDA
You know what I don’t get.

Why you stood by him. I would’ve
stuck a knife in his heart.
Alicia.

She studies her.

It’s sort of not rude from Kalinda.

I always thought I would too. When
I heard about those other scandals,
those other wives, I thought-- how
can you allow yourself to be used
that way? And then it happened.
And I was...

Alicia and Kalinda trade a look.

What?

INT. JUDGE BOGIRA’S CHAMBERS - DAY
The silent chambers. Alicia stands in front of Bogira’s
desk, waiting. He’s not there. She shoots a look toward
Matan sitting quietly in the corner. Something weird here.
A second.

And Judge Bogira enters.

Takes off his robes.

JUDGE BOGIRA
Well, Mrs. Follick.
(how to start)
Chicago Homicide has decided to
reopen its investigation into the
murder of Michael Combs.
Alicia’s eyes widen.

What?

JUDGE BOGIRA (CONT’D)
Detective Briggs, doing an admirable
amount of due diligence, confirmed that
Cindy Comb’s brother, Danny, not only
had access to his employer’s pick-up
truck on the night of the murder, but
the dog hairs admitted into evidence
matched those found at his workplace.
The D.A., in his radiant wisdom, has
decided to withdraw the charges against
your client and pursue a case against
Cindy Combs. Isn’t that right, Mr.
Brody? All I need is a yes or no.

Yes.

MATAN
(not happy)

JUDGE BOGIRA
Good. Then in ten minutes I’m
dismissing the jury. Any
objections? Good. We’re done here.
Alicia can’t believe it.

She stares at them.

And turns,

Jennifer is pale, crying. She can’t believe it either. She
walks slowly to Alicia and holds her, collapses against her.
Both in tears.
Thank you.

JENNIFER COMBS

Alicia just shakes her head, hugs her back, wipes the tears
from her face when... a voice comes from behind them...
Mommy.

LILLY COMBS

A small happy voice. Jennifer closes her eyes overwhelmed as
she turns to see a little girl approaching. Lilly. Sweet.
In Sunday best. She runs. And Jennifer bends down and picks
her up. Crying. And...
...Alicia watches, moved.
INT. WORKSTATION ROW - 27TH FLOOR - NIGHT
The office is dark. Just sparkling skyscraper lights
outside. The sound of a floor buffer somewhere. Alicia
walks toward her office, high heels off, talking on her cell:
ALICIA
No, it just went a little late,
Jackie. That’s all.
JACKIE (O.S.)
I made a pot roast, and I wanted
to know if you’re coming home for
dinner.
Alicia laughs.
What?

Jackie looks up, confused.
JACKIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
What did I say?

ALICIA
Nothing. That’s just the call I
always used to make to David.
JACKIE (O.S.)
Well, I don’t understand your humor.
Alicia smiles, opens her door, finds her office...
INT. ALICIA’S OFFICE - NIGHT

crosses to her desk.

Leaving a bottle of champagne.

Sorry, I didn’t know you-- Just an

Will laughs. Alicia takes the champagne, looks at the label

Oh, one more thing.
Yes, sir.
