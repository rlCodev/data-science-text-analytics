EXT. HAZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

1

HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
the stars. We’re CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:
HAZEL (V.O.)
You have a choice in this world, I
believe, about how to tell sad stories.
CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
2

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

2

Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS “GUS”
WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
[Though we DO NOT SEE HIS FACE, the impression we get is that
the two of them look very much the perfect Hollywood couple.]
HAZEL (V.O.)
On the one hand, you can sugar coat - the
way they do in movies and romance novels.
3

EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT

3

“Perfect” Hazel and “Perfect” Gus in a GONDOLA in some
foreign country. She rests her head on his shoulder. Again,
we cannot get a good look at him.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Where villains are vanquished and...
heroes are born and...
4

INT. ANNE FRANK HOUSE - DAY

4

“Perfect” Hazel and “Perfect” Gus kiss in an unmarked room.
The CAMERA favors Hazel. Gus remains unseen.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... beautiful people learn beautiful
lessons...
5

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
“Perfect” Hazel and “Perfect” Gus fall onto a bed together.
Though we still don’t see Gus, the love in her eyes for him
is unmistakable.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... and nothing is too messed up that
can’t be fixed with an apology and a
Peter Gabriel song.

EXT. HAZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.
HAZEL (V.O.)
I like that way as much as the next girl,
believe me. It’s just not the truth.
Hazel closes her eyes.
HAZEL (V.O.)
This is the truth.
And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:
Sorry.

HAZEL (V.O.)
FADE IN ON:

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

7

The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Late in the Winter of my 17th year...
There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
First, you’ll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
help her to breathe.
Second, you’ll notice her hair - which we couldn’t see in the
grass. It’s much shorter than the “Perfect” version, the
result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
years before.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... my mother decided I was depressed.
HAZEL
I’m not depressed.
Hazel’s legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
to the oncologist, DR. MARIA:
FRANNIE
... she eats like a bird. She barely
leaves the house,

QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:
HAZEL (V.O.)
The booklets and web sites always list
depression as a side effect of cancer...

INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossiping, laughing - being
teenage girls, basically. And here’s Hazel. With her Mom. And
her oxygen tank. Just another day.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Depression’s not a side effect of
cancer...
9

INT. HAZEL’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

9

She sits watching game shows in the middle of the afternoon.
Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A glass of water. And a whole
host of prescriptions. Hazel eyes them with indifference.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... it’s a side effect of dying.
10

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

10

Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily underlined copy
of a novel (“An Imperial Affliction” by Peter Van Houten).
She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of delight. A
YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his shoulder
playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat - goes
back to the book.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Which is what was happening to me.
And we CUT BACK TO:

Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
dangle her feet.
FRANNIE
... some days she won’t even get out of
bed.
Dr. Maria scratches her face, thinking.
DR. MARIA
I may switch you to Zoloft. Or Lexapro.
And twice a day instead of once.
HAZEL
Why stop there?
Hmm?

DR. MARIA

HAZEL
Keep ‘em coming. I can take it. I’m like
the Keith Richards of cancer kids.
(ALT)
I’m like the Charlie Sheen of cancer
kids.
Dr. Maria looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.
DR. MARIA
Have you been going to that Support Group
I suggested?
Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.
FRANNIE
She’s gone a few times.
HAZEL
I’m not sure it’s for me.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

CLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.
PATRICK
... we are gathered here today literally - in the heart of Jesus.
Patrick gestures above, to the rafters of the church, which
is in fact shaped like a cross. (Thus they are metaphorically - in the heart of Jesus.)
ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest
thing she could be doing right now.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
Who would like to share their story with
the group?
The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.
Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:
SPEAKER #1
Jillian. Lymphoma.
SPEAKER #2
Angel. Ewing sarcoma.
SPEAKER #3
Sid. Astrocytoma.

As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:
HAZEL (V.O.)
I’ll spare you the gory details of
Patrick’s ball cancer. Basically...
13

INT. PATRICK’S BATHROOM - DAY

Patrick is urinating. We stay on his FACE as he finds

HAZEL (V.O.)
...to show us that one day, if we’re
lucky, we could be just like him.
PATRICK
... which is why I believe every day is a
blessing. Thank you for listening.
Patrick smiles broadly when he finishes. And everyone says:
ALL IN UNISON
“We’re here for you Patrick.”
Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
patch, ISAAC. He’s also shaking his head.
PATRICK
Now who else would like to share?
(no response)
Hazel?
Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she
stands, sighs...
HAZEL
I’m, uh, Hazel.
(beat)
Thyroid originally but with quite the
impressive satellite colony in my lungs.
Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.
PATRICK
And how are you doing Hazel?
Hazel has no idea how to answer that.
HAZEL (V.O.)
You mean besides the terminal cancer?
But that’s not what she says. She says:
HAZEL
Alright? I guess...?

EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out, disappointed to
see her Mother waiting there.
HAZEL
You didn’t go to the movies, did you?
FRANNIE
(caught)
Maybe next time.
Hazel is a little bummed by this, the lack of life being
lived by her parents. But what can she do.
FRANNIE (CONT’D)

So... was it amazing?
Hazel just rolls her eyes, exhales, and we CUT TO:

Hazel and her parents in the kitchen. Frannie prepares
Hazel’s lunch. Hazel’s father, MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his
best to stay positive) drinks coffee at the table.
HAZEL (V.O.)
And worse worse worst of all... support
group.
HAZEL
Ugh. You can’t make me.
MICHAEL
Of course we can, we’re your parents.
Hazel frowns.
FRANNIE
You need to get out of the house. Make
friends. Be a teenager.
HAZEL
If you want me to be a teenager, don’t
send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake
ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets
and take pot.
MICHAEL
You don’t take pot.
HAZEL
See, that’s the kind of thing I would
know with a fake ID.

And so I went...
Frannie’s car pulls into the parking lot.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Not because I wanted to or because I
thought it would help. But for the same
reason I did anything these days...
Hazel, oxygen tank in tow, steps out, helped by Frannie.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... to make my parents happy.
She turns to go. Quickly realizing that her mother isn’t
going anywhere.
HAZEL
First, you wouldn’t let me drive myself.
And now you’re gonna sit and wait the
whole time?
FRANNIE
Of course not, no. I...
(she totally is)
I have errands to run.
Hazel knows she’s not planning to run any errands. She
doesn’t press the issue.
Love you.

FRANNIE (CONT’D)

HAZEL
Love you too Mom.
HAZEL (V.O.)
The only thing worse than biting it from
cancer - is having a kid bite it from

I’ll take the stairs.
The KID nods. The doors shut. She turns to go, walking right
into:
Ooph.

GUS

Sorry!

HAZEL

A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.
My bad.

GUS

No, it’s...

HAZEL

For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
one another. Hazel is speechless.
Excuse me.

With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

CU The Beautiful Boy. He’s staring at Hazel. That same flirty

CU Hazel. Feeling his eyes. She meets them - then quickly,

JULIE
Hi. I’m Julie. 15. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
It’s been an ok week I guess. I’ve been
sleeping better. More energy. I don’t
feel as sluggish as I used to. So far,
everyone seems pleased with my results.
But it’s hard, you know. My friends are
at school, they have parties on weekends.
I can’t help but feel I’m missing out. I
should be grateful, I know that, I
just... it’s hard, that’s all. It’s hard.

Hazel tries to concentrate on the share - but she still feels
the eyes of the Beautiful Boy. It’s intimidating. And
intimidation irritates her. Hazel decides to play the game,
turning towards him and meeting his gaze.
A staring contest.
The eager Support Group Member’s voice recedes into BG along
with the rest of the universe as the acoustic, guitar-picked
intro to Josh Ritter’s “Change of Time” fills their world.
The staring contest continues for several more beats. The
Beautiful Boy smiles, enjoying this. Hazel raises her
eyebrows - not looking away, intimidation be damned.
Patrick’s voice eventually swims back into focus.
PATRICK (O.S.)
Thank you Julie. Isaac, I know you’re
facing a challenging time. Perhaps you’d
like to say something.
TWO SHOT of Isaac, sitting next to Gus. We can see that Gus
continues to stare at Hazel.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
Or maybe your friend would like to.
Which causes the Beautiful Boy to look away. Aha! He’s lost
the staring contest. Hazel smiles to herself. Gus, who does
not want to share, looks over at Isaac. Isaac stands.
ISAAC
Yeah, um... I’m Isaac. Eye cancer.
(beat)
It’s looking like another surgery in a
couple weeks. After which, well, I’ll be
blind... Not that I’m complaining or
anything.

Augustus here...
Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name AUGUSTUS. Hazel stores that in the back of her mind.
ISAAC (CONT’D)
So... yeah. That’s what’s up.
ALL IN UNISON
“We’re here for you Isaac.”
PATRICK
Ok Augustus. Your turn...
Hazel looks at Augustus. He definitely doesn’t want to speak.
But he’ll do it. With one more radiant smile in Hazel’s
direction, he stands:
GUS
I’m Augustus Waters. Had a touch of
osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago lost this baby as a result...
Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.
GUS (CONT’D)
But really I’m just here at Isaac’s
request.
PATRICK
And how are you feeling Augustus?
GUS
Me? Oh I’m grand. I’m on a roller coaster
that only goes up, my friend.
Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Hazel, immediately
embarrassed, stops smiling and looks away.
PATRICK
Perhaps you’d like to share your fears
with the group, Augustus.
My fears?

I’m scared of anything it’s... not doing
that.
Patrick doesn’t quite have the tools to deal with that.
PATRICK
Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that?
And Hazel’s hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
Hazel! That’s unexpected.
Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
watches her, waits for it.
HAZEL
I just wanna say... there will come a
time when, you know, all of us are dead.
Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.
HAZEL (CONT’D)
It might be tomorrow. Might be a million
years from now but... it’s gonna happen.
And when it does, enough generations will
come and go, there’ll be no one left to
remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us.
The look on Gus’s face is unreadable.
HAZEL (CONT’D)
Oblivion’s inevitable, dude. And if that
scares you, well, I suggest you ignore
it. God knows it’s what everyone else
does.
A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus’s face,
not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing

I thought we were in a church basement

the simpler pleasures of existence.
Particularly given that, as you so

they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
each other. She hears:
Always.

ISAAC

Always.

MONICA

HAZEL
What’s with the “always?”
GUS
“Always” is their thing. They’ll “always”
love each other and whatnot. Must have
texted “always” to each other at least
four million times this year.
They continue to watch the show. It’s pretty gross. Isaac
squeezes Monica’s breast like a clown horn.

As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in

Let me tell you... not being able to

They don’t hurt you unless you light

awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:

INT. GUS’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world’s worst
driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.
GUS
I failed the test a couple times.
HAZEL
You don’t say.
GUS
Most amputees can drive with no problem
but... yeah. Not me.
HAZEL
I’m surprised you have a license.
GUS
Tell me about it!
Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.
GUS (CONT’D)
The fourth time I took the test... it was
going about how this is going... and when
it was over, the instructor looks at me
and goes, “your driving, while
unpleasant... is not technically unsafe.”
HAZEL
Aha. Cancer perk.
GUS
Total cancer perk.

Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was

weak lungs.
Eventually they arrive at Gus’s basement bedroom. There’s a

Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.

embracing your destiny, leaving a mark on

looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her

“Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something.”
Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share

“Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!”
Hazel smiles again.
And then a third text:

Isaac. He finally speaks.

She didn’t want to break it off after the
surgery. Said she couldn’t handle it. I’m
about to lose my eyesight and she can’t

Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.

I kept saying “always” to her. Always,
always, always. And she just kept talking
over me and not saying it back. It was
like I was already gone, you know?
“Always” was a promise! You can’t break
promises.

Sometimes people don’t understand the
promises they’re making when they make
them.
ISAAC
Right, sure, but you keep the promise
anyway. That’s what love is. Love is

hair, a week-old beard. This is PETER VAN HOUTEN.
LIDEWIJ
You invited them, remember?
He looks them up and down a beat. Then turns to Lidewij.
VAN HOUTEN
You know why I left America, Lidewij? To
never have to encounter Americans.
(beat)
Get rid of them.
Hazel and Gus can’t believe it. This is terrible!
LIDEWIJ
I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
She virtually shoves Gus and Hazel in the couch near Van
Houten. They all sit there. One beat, two beats. No one knows
what to say. Until finally:
VAN HOUTEN
Which of you is Augustus Waters?
Gus raises his hand tentatively. Van Houten looks him over.
Grunts. The awkwardness returns. Eventually, Hazel says:
HAZEL
Mr. Van Houten.
Hmm...

VAN HOUTEN

Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman, crosses his
slippers.
HAZEL
Thank you. For writing back to us.
VAN HOUTEN
Clearly an error in judgment. Yours are
the first missives to which I’ve replied
and look where that got me.

Another scotch and soda, please.
LIDEWIJ

VAN HOUTEN
She thinks I have a drinking problem.
LIDEWIJ
I also think the Earth is round.
Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.
VAN HOUTEN
So you like my book.
HAZEL
Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made meeting
you his Wish so that we could come here

He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.
GUS
Incidentally, thank you for dinner last
night.
VAN HOUTEN

We bought them dinner last night?
LIDEWIJ
It was our pleasure.

You’ve come a long way so... what is it I

Lidewij sighs but she does as she’s told. A few seconds

Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.
HAZEL
(yelling over the music)
I’m sorry, sir. We don’t speak Swedish.
VAN HOUTEN
(yelling)
Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
important thing is not what nonsense the
voices are saying, but what the voices
are feeling.
The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.
GUS
Are you messing with us?
Pardon?

VAN HOUTEN

GUS
Is this some kind of performance?
VAN HOUTEN
Rudolf Otto said that if you had not
encountered the numinous then his work
was not for you. And I say to you, my
friends, if you cannot hear Afasi Och
Filthy’s bravadic response to
fearfulness, then my work is not for you.

VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
Let us imagine that you are racing a
tortoise.
Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.
VAN HOUTEN (CONT’D)
The tortoise has a ten yard head start.
In the time it takes you to run ten
yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one
yard. And so on, forever. You are faster
than the tortoise but you can never catch
him, you see, you can only decrease his
lead. Now certainly you can run past the
tortoise as long as you don’t contemplate
the mechanics involved but the question
of how turns out to be so complicated
that no one really solved it until
Cantor’s proof that some infinities are
bigger than other infinities.
Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.
VAN HOUTEN (CONT’D)
I assume that answers your questions.
GUS

I don’t know what’s going on.
VAN HOUTEN
And yet you seemed so intelligent in

Has the cancer found its way to your

Peter!

LIDEWIJ

Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
situation.
HAZEL
Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for

Mr. Van Houten, you said you would tell

Nothing happens to them! They’re
fictions. They cease to exist the moment
the novel is over.
This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won’t
accept it.
HAZEL
They can’t!
(again, has to calm
herself)
I mean, I understand. In a literary
sense. But it’s impossible NOT to imagine
some future -VAN HOUTEN
I can’t do this. Lidewij, get rid of
them, please.

turns back to Hazel)
I won’t indulge your childish whims. I
refuse to pity you in the manner in which
you’re accustomed.

this, so we pay for your treatments, for
your oxygen machines. We give you food

long enough -LIDEWIJ
Peter, that’s enough!
VAN HOUTEN
You are a side effect of an evolutionary
process that cares little for individual
lives. You are a failed experiment in
mutation.
Lidewij throws her apron on the ground, tears in her eyes.
She’s done with this. Gus as well has balled his fists, ready
to fight. But not Hazel. Van Houten’s words have not phased
her one bit. She rises from the couch.
HAZEL
Listen douchepants. You’re not gonna tell

A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.
Shall we?

LIDEWIJ

Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
far so good. They find themselves in an office space.
LIDEWIJ (CONT’D)
This is the bookcase that hid the Frank
family and four others.
The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.
Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
tank.
Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
breathing the entire time.
ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She’s
definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
he looks at Hazel:
GUS (CONT’D)
That’s enough -HAZEL
(resolute)
I’m ok.
Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we’re aware of her
every breath. It’s dark. And it’s becoming very difficult.
Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
herself through.
Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.
GUS
We’re at the top. That’s it.
Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
And now they’re in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
for as long as they could. There’s a TIME LINE detailing
their story.
LIDEWIJ
The only member of the whole family to
survive was Otto, Anne’s father.
Gus takes Hazel’s hand.
LIDEWIJ (CONT’D)
I don’t know how you go on, without your
family.
Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
details the last days of Anne Frank’s life. Over it, we hear
a YOUNG GIRL’s VOICE reading from the diary.
The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
same. The room is dark.

GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)

Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.
GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
“...but about the beauty that still
remains.”
Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
Their eyes meet. The emotions build...
GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
“Try to recapture the happiness within
yourself. Think of all the beauty in
everything around you... and be happy.”
And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-meagainst-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they’ve
experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
small eternity.
Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts “bravo!” Hazel blushes,
Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. We hear:
HAZEL (V.O.)
I fell in love with him the way you fall
asleep. Slowly. Then all at once.

They fall onto Gus’s bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the

shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:
HAZEL (CONT’D)
I love you, Augustus Waters.
GUS

She’s in the house?
GUS
Who cares where she is? This is not about

Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts

HAZEL
Shouldn’t we wait until dark to do this?

Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.
Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.

Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He’s a

enjoying himself. Finally there’s a DIRECT HIT on the car
door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.
GUS
Keep throwing, keep throwing!
Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his
mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.
Eventually, MONICA’S MOM opens the front door and comes out.
MONICA’S MOM
What in God’s name -An EGG whizzes by her head, causing her to flinch
dramatically.
Aaah!

MONICA’S MOM (CONT’D)

She sees Hazel, Gus, and Isaac. Tries to make sense of this.
GUS
Are you Monica’s mom?
MONICA’S MOM

I am.
GUS
Hello ma’am. Your daughter has done an
injustice and we’ve come here seeking
revenge. We may not look like much.
Between the three of us, we have five
legs, four eyes, and two and a half
working lungs. But we also have two dozen
eggs. So If I was you, I would go back
inside.
Monica’s Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,
she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus

He’s had a tough night, Hazel. His blood

They’re gonna stop the chemo.
They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.

Mrs. Waters doesn’t want to say no but in her brief

She needs to be with him too. Hazel nods.
MRS. WATERS
We’ll tell him you were here.
HAZEL

What a load of shit, eh kid?
Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn’t make sense. She
turns around and, sure enough, it’s Peter Van Houten.

Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.
VAN HOUTEN
We need to fake pray now.
Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, is trying to
make sense of this unexpected appearance, when she hears:
MINISTER
And now we’ll hear from Gus’s... special
friend Hazel Lancaster.
Hazel stands, walks up towards the casket. When she gets
there, she removes a pack of Camel Lights, places it on the
coffin where other mourners have left dirt and rocks.
She turns to face everyone.
HAZEL
I was his girlfriend.
Hazel clears her throat. Reaches into her pocket. Takes out
her notes.
CU - the eulogy she already read. We see, in her handwriting,
“Augustus Waters was the great star-crossed love of my life.”
BACK ON Hazel. She looks up. Sees Gus’s parents in the front.
She looks back at her notes, one last time. Folds it up.
And instead, she says:
HAZEL (CONT’D)
There’s a beautiful quote in Gus’s home
that reads “if you want the rainbow, you
gotta deal with the rain.”
Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:
HAZEL (V.O.)
I didn’t believe a word, of course. But
that was ok. I knew this was the right
thing to do.
Gus’s Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Funerals - I’d decided - they’re not for
the dead. They’re for the living.
Van Houten watches as well. It’s impossible to know what he’s
thinking at this moment. And we CUT TO:

The worst of it over. Hazel hugs her parents goodbye.
FRANNIE
Are you sure you don’t want some company?
HAZEL
I just want to drive for a while.
Frannie nods. Hazel turns and walks through the parking lot
towards the car. She gets in, turns the ignition.
Suddenly, a KNOCK on the window.
VAN HOUTEN
Can I hitch a ride with you?

Hazel is about to say absolutely not. But before she gets a
word out, Van Houten is already in the car. He shuts the
door, whips out his flask, takes a swig. Hazel looks at him
in disgust. A few beats of awkward silence passes. Until...
VAN HOUTEN
Omnis Cellula e cellula.
Hazel ignores him.
VAN HOUTEN (CONT’D)
Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite
a bit in his last -HAZEL
You read your fan mail now?
VAN HOUTEN
Oh I would hardly call him a fan. He
despised me. But he was quite insistent I

became of Anna and her mother. So here I
am and that’s your answer: omnis cellula

Well I’m sorry for your loss.

Hazel, I’m trying to explain something to

What I want is for you to get out of my

Van Houten takes out a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

He holds it

VAN HOUTEN
You’ll want to read this-Hazel snatches the paper from his hand, crumples it up in a
ball and throws it at him. It lands on the floor at his
feet.
HAZEL
Get out of the car!
He does as he’s told, stepping out onto the street.
Hazel is about to drive off. But before she does, she takes
one last look at the sad man by the side of the road.
Swallowing her anger, she rolls down her window.
HAZEL (CONT’D)
Hey Van Houten...

And with that, she drives away. In the rearview mirror, she

maybe, he will try to change. Hazel blinks away some tears
and drives on. CUT TO:

Hazel sits on the floor against her bed and weeps. Soon
there’s a knock.
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Can I come in?
Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn’t cry.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
I’m so so sorry.

Hazel and Isaac sit on the grass, near where the old swing
set of tears used to be, talking.
ISAAC
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
HAZEL
He was really fighting for breath, I
guess. He eventually went unconscious,
but it seems like, yeah, it wasn’t great
or anything. Dying sucks.
ISAAC

It just seems so impossible.

Are you angry?

He is not my friend and -- how do you
know about that?
ISAAC
We talked at the cemetery. Said he came
all this way to give you that.
HAZEL
Yeah well I’m over it. I never want to
read another word of that asshole’s
again.
ISAAC
Yeah but he didn’t write it - Gus did.
HAZEL

Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash
in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She’s about to
give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
the passenger’s seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:

Mr. Van Houten, I’m a good person but a
shitty writer. You’re a shitty person but
a good writer. We’d make a good team. I
don’t want to ask you any favors but if
you have the time, and from what I saw
you have plenty, please fix this for me.
It’s a eulogy for Hazel.

Hazel is overcome with emotion.
GUS’S VOICE (CONT’D)
She asked me to write one and I’m trying,
I just, I could use a little flair. See
the thing is... we all want to be
remembered.

And she got it. Maybe she wasn’t loved
widely but she was loved deeply. And
isn’t that more than most of us get?

She sleeps. He kneels by her side.
GUS’S VOICE
She was in ICU and I snuck in for ten
minutes and sat with her before I got
caught. Her eyes were closed, her lungs
were intubated...
Gus takes her hand and holds it.
GUS’S VOICE (CONT’D)
... but her hands were still her hands,
still warm, and the nails painted this
dark blue black color and I just held her
hands and I willed myself to imagine a
world without us and what a worthless
world that would be.

Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen

looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.
GUS’S VOICE
She’s so beautiful. You don’t get tired
of looking at her. You never worry if
she’s smarter than you cause you know she

[All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus’s leg, we
SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don’t make
these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
beautiful - because they’re real.]
GUS’S VOICE
I love her, god I love her. I’m so lucky
to love her, Van Houten. You don’t get to
choose if you get hurt in this world but
you do have a say in who hurts you.

Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.

Ok, Hazel Grace?

Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:
Ok.
