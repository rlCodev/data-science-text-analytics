The place is packed with people. On a small stage, a band is
playing Caribbean music.
Orlando walks in as an attractive and electric young woman,
MARINA (27), sings a salsa song with grace and talent.
There’s something strong and magnetic about her, A SLIGHTLY
ROUGH FEMININITY... Is she a transsexual woman?
No one at the bar is paying much attention to Marina’s
performance, except for Orlando, who stares at her,
fascinated and sings along softly.

Thank you my love.

With a musical cake and everything!
Orlando pulls the envelope out of the pocket jacket.
Here.

ORLANDO

Marina receives the envelope and opens it.
MARINA
How formal.
“Valid for two airline tickets to
the Iguazu Falls.”
Orlando!
ORLANDO
It's no small thing.
It's one of the seven natural
wonders of the world.
MARINA
Oh wow!
And when are we going?
ORLANDO
In ten days.
MARINA
In ten days...
Marina stands up and walks to Orlando. She hughs him from
behind and kiss him in the mouth.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Hey, and why is it “valid for”?

ORLANDO
It’s a long story...
MARINA
You haven`t bought them yet?

5.
ORLANDO
Yes...
I bought them and printed them out,
and I put them in an envelope.
Okay, and?

MARINA

ORLANDO
And I had them with me at the
sauna.
And?

ORLANDO
And I can’t remember where the fuck
I put them.

Poor old man with senile dementia.

of a dog.

INT. ORLANDO’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

INT. ORLANDO’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

14

The silence in the room is suddenly interrupted by Orlando’s
gasping sounds.
Marina turns the light on. Orlando is sitting up at his side
of the bed with his back turned towards her, having
difficulty breathing.
Orlando?

MARINA

Orlando tries to say something to her, but no words come out.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Orlando, What’s wrong?!
ORLANDO
I don’t know.
MARINA
You don’t know?
ORLANDO
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
Orlando stands up from the bed, tries to walk but falls down.
Marina runs to grabs him.
MARINA
Orlando! What the fuck is going on?
Come here.
Marina manages to sit Orlando on the bed.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Honey... What is it?
15

INT. ORLANDO’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Marina carries Orlando outside the apartment. He puts him
against the wall.
MARINA
Lean against the wall. Look at me.

something in her bag.

7.
MARINA (CONT’D)
The keys, do you have them?
No...

ORLANDO

Marina search for the keys on Orlando’s shirt. No luck.
Orlando...

MARINA

She runs back to the apartment.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Wait here.
No, Diabla, stop! Come here!
Orlando stars walking with diffulty to the stair case. The
lights go out and he fells through the stairs.
Orlando?

MARINA (CONT’D)

Marina sees him and runs through the staircase. DIABLA, the
dog comes along and barks.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Orlando!
Orlando, honey!
Marina tries to put Orlando on his feet.
I’m fine.
Let’s go!

ORLANDO
MARINA

INT. ORLANDO’S CAR -- NIGHT

Marina drives nervously; the streets are empty. She notices
that Orlando is in a lot of pain, unable to speak, in the
passenger seat next to her. She looks forward again.
MARINA
Honey, talk to me, ok?
He doesn’t respond.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Talk to me! Orlando! Please...

8.
He barely reacts.
ORLANDO
(mumbling)
Where are we going?
MARINA
To the hospital, Orlando, where
else? Focus, okay?
Orlando slips into unconsciousness once more, without enough
energy to decide.
Hurry up.
What?
Hurry up.
Ok, Ok.

ORLANDO
MARINA
ORLANDO

He barely responds, and drives off at full speed.

I/E. ORLANDO’S CAR / HOSPITAL / EMERGENCY ROOM / REANIMATION
17
CUBICLE -- NIGHT
Marina brings the car to a screeching halt at a HOSPITAL
entrance, honking her horn. She gets out of the car.
MARINA
Help, please!
One PARAMEDIC runs to the car.
PARAMEDIC
Easy, ma’am. Let us take care of
him...
(TO ORLANDO)
Are you OK? What’s your name?
Can you hear me?
(TO PARAMEDIC 2)
Juan Pablo, hurry up! Hurry!
Two more paramedics arrive with a stretcher and try to pull
Orlando out of the car; it’s a difficult task because his
arms and legs are rigid and stuck in his seat. Orlando’s body
is HIT SEVERAL TIMES in the process.

9.
MARINA
Be careful... careful!
Despite his limp state, they manage to pull him out of the
car.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Be careful.
They drag him towards the hospital.
PARAMEDIC
What`s your name? What`s your name?
Can you hear me?
MARINA
His name is Orlando.
PARAMEDIC
(as they advance)
What happened?
MARINA
I don’t know what happened!
PARAMEDIC
What medication is he taking?

None

MARINA

PARAMEDIC
How old is he?
MARINA
Fifty-seven.
PARAMEDIC
Hurry up, he’s not responding! Did
he feel sick at some point?
MARINA
When he woke up... He had a
headache, and he was acting
strange.
PARAMEDIC
When was that?

10.
MARINA
Like fifteen or twenty minutes ago.
Marina anxiously watches how the nurses push Orlando into the
Reanimation cubicle. Impulsively, she follows them inside.
PARAMEDIC
Male patient, 57 years old, loss of
consciousness, his head is
bleeding. Let's go. 1,2,3...
Marina, standing motionless in one corner of the cubicle,
observes how the paraemdics and nurses work.
Due to the emergency, no one realizes that she has entered
the reanimation cubicle and is still there, watching
everything, looking disoriented. A FEMALE NURSE sees her and
draws closer.
FEMALE NURSE
Ma’am, you have to wait outside.
MARINA
I brought him here as fast as I
could.
FEMALE NURSE
Please, you have to wait outside.
We’ll take care of him, okay? Stay
calm. Go, go...
The Nurse pulls her out of the cubicle.
Marina stares through the glass door how the paramedics treat
Orlando. She walks back and lean on the wall.
18

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

18

Marina is left alone, standing in front of the cubicle’s door
by herself. She waits for several seconds...
Until the NURSE appears with some of Orlando’s belongings.
FEMALE NURSE
Are you a family member?
MARINA
No. I just brought him here.
FEMALE NURSE
You don’t know him?

11.
MARINA
Yes, we’re friends.

Oh.

FEMALE NURSE
(suspiciously)

(rushed)
These are his things. They can’t
stay in there.
MARINA
How is he doing?
(to the nurse)
FEMALE NURSE
They’ll let you know. Just wait a
little longer.
The Female Nurse leaves, Marina waits for several tense
seconds. Until a DOCTOR (60), projecting status and
authority, emerges and faces her.
DOCTOR
Good night.
MARINA
Good night.
DOCTOR
(tactfully)
Are you a member of Mr. Onetto’s
family?
Marina draws closer to him.
Yes

MARINA

The Doctor looks at her for a moment, scrutinizing her.
DOCTOR
Are you his partner?
MARINA
Yes, we’re partners.
The Doctor raises the volume of his voice in order to draw
her out of her state of shock.
DOCTOR
Excuse me, your name is...?
MARINA
Marina Vidal

12.
DOCTOR
But... that’s a nickname?
Excuse me?

MARINA

DOCTOR
Could you come with me? So that we
can speak in private...
MARINA
Is something wrong?
They begin walking through the hallway, they talk but we
can’t hear what the doctor is saying.
19

INT. BATHROOM - HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

19

Marina enters the bathroom, she is alone. She breathes
heavily and enters a bathroom cubicle. She fall off her
knees, her head leans on the floor. The breathing gets loud
and powerful.
She washes her face and looks in the mirror. She can’t
believe what happened.
20

EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

20

Marina is calling GABO, the phone rings for several seconds.
GABO (O.S.)
(into the phone, sounding
sleepy)
Orlando
MARINA
I’m Orlando’s friend.
GABO
Excuse me, who is this?
MARINA
This is Marina. I’m
GABO
Yes, I know who you are.
MARINA
The thing is, Orlando was feeling
sick.

13.

When?

GABO

MARINA
About an and a half hour ago.
And I brought him to the hospital,
but... uh...
GABO
Which hospital?
MARINA
Saint Thomas. He had a crisis in
the car.
Ok.

GABO

MARINA
And he died.
He died?!

GABO

Marina stutters.
MARINA
Yes. Just now... I’m so sorry.
Pause.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Hello?
(long pause)
GABO
Yes, I’m here. Have you called
anyone else?
MARINA
No, no one.
Ok.

GABO

MARINA
But I need someone to come here. I
can’t handle all of this.
GABO
Okay, don’t worry, I’ll let the
family know.

14.

Okay.

MARINA

GABO
Don’t call anyone. Ok?
Ok

MARINA

Gabo hands up. Marina looks around nervously; no one seems to
be watching her. She evaluates the situation. Slyly begins to
walk away, towards the street.
21

EXT. HOSPITAL - STREETS -- DAWN

21

Marina begins to walk away from the hospital at a firm pace.
She’d rather avoid the conflict, and Gabo has already been
given notice...
She begins to jog quickly. She advances a few blocks, but...
A patrol car pulls over and a POLICE OFFICER (30) comes down.
A light flashes over both of them.
LOW-RANKING POLICE OFFICER
Miss Marina Vidal?
MARINA
Yes, what is it?
22

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

The low-ranking police officer walks with Marina through the
hospital hallway. A CHIEF POLICE OFFICER and the doctor are
waiting for her.
Sargent
Thank you
Excuse me

LOW-RANKING POLICE OFFICER
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
LOW-RANKING POLICE OFFICER

The low ranking police officer leaves.
MARINA
(to the doctor)
You didn’t have to treat me like a
criminal.

15.
DOCTOR
(to the chief police
officer)
I’ll leave you to your work, excuse
me.
The doctor leaves.

CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
(to Marina, firmly)
Miss, I need your information.
Here?

MARINA

The Chief Police Officer has little patience.
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
Here. Full name
Marina--

MARINA

CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
(exasperated)
Do you have an ID card with you?
Marina returns his stare, then gives up and pulls her ID out
of her handbag. After looking at it, the Chief Police Officer
gazes at her severely.
MARINA
My new ID card is still pending,
sir.
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
Until you receive it,
this is still your legal name.
MARINA
My name is Marina Vidal. Is there a
problem with that?
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
Why did you run off?
Gabo arrives from behind. Marina doesn’t see him.
MARINA
Why am I being detained?

16.
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
You’re not being detained, sir.
Marina looks at him with a serious expression on her face.
MARINA
Then why do you have my ID card?
GABO
Good night.
Marina turns and sees a scruffy, bald man with a potbelly
waiting attentively a few meters away. It’s GABO (55), who’s
wearing an orthopedic boot.
GABO (CONT’D)
Marina? Thank you for everything.
I’m sorry you had to go through all
of this. I’m Gabo.
MARINA
(nervous, remorseful)
Hello Gabo.
GABO
How are you?
Gabo comes closer to greet her with a kiss on the cheek, then
hesitates, and finally greets her with a handshake.
GABO (CONT’D)
Hi. How are you?
He then greets the Chief Police Officer, who is trying to
figure them out.
GABO (CONT’D)
Gabriel Onetto, I’m the brother of
the deceased. Is something the
matter?
CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
(gesturing towards Marina)
No, everything is fine. He came
brought him to the hospital and
then wanted to leave in a hurry,
but we needed to speak to him.
GABO
Well, you can speak to me. I’m his
family, and I’m going to handle
everything.
(MORE)

17.
GABO (CONT'D)
You must understand that the lady
here was with my brother when he
died, so it’s a sensitive
situation.
The Chief police handles back Marina’s ID.
Thanks.

MARINA

CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
(to Marina)
Your phone number, please.
Humiliated, Marina dictates her phone number to him.
MARINA
Yes... 98149575.

Excuse me, could I have a glass of
water?
MARINA

ALESSANDRA (45), Marina’s strong and stylish boss, it’s in
the bar writing something down. Marina approaches.
ALESSANDRA
You didn’t want to come,
and I was just calling you
to ask if you could take the night
shift.
Crap.
MARINA
I didn’t get to check my phone,
Alessandra. The celebration was
pretty intense.
ALESSANDRA
But you came. I appreciate that.
Do you need anything?
MARINA
No... Everything is fine.
ALESSANDRA
Are you sure?
MARINA
Yes, I’m sure.
ALESSANDRA
Always so mysterious.

WAITRESS
It’s been ringing for a while.
Thank you.

She makes her way to the second floor.

INT. MODERN RESTAURANT - SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

While she walks through the second floor and hallway trying
to look for a quite place to talk.
SONIA
Hello? I’m Sonia. Orlando’s wife. I
mean, his ex-wife.
MARINA
I know. How are you?
SONIA
There’s no need for the formality.
(silence)
Look, I talked to Gabo, and he told
me that you’re living in Orlando’s
apartment. Is that true?
MARINA
Yes, it’s true.
SONIA
Well, I’ll be needing his car.
Of course.

MARINA

SONIA
You could have left the car with
Gabo.
MARINA
He didn’t want it. Look ma'am...
Look.
(MORE)

20.
MARINA (CONT'D)
Tell me when you need it and I can
drop it off.
SONIA
Let’s see... Tomorrow. Could you
drop it off at my office tomorrow?
I’ll text you the address, and...
You can leave it in the parking
lot. You can ask there... And
they’ll tell you where to park.

OK.

MARINA

SONIA
At 10:30? Is that time OK?
MARINA
I’ll work it out.
SONIA
Anything else of his that you might
have?
MARINA
No. Just the intimate things.
SONIA
(hurt, delirious)
Well, we’ll have to work out what
to do about the apartment.
A long silence.
Of course.

MARINA

SONIA
I’d like for you to handle
all practical affairs with me,
okay?
MARINA
All right. Could we talk about that
when we meet? I'm working right
now.

21.

INT. MODERN RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
The restaurant is packed and Marina can barely keep it
together.
YOUNG MAN
(from another table)
Are you going to bring us our
check, or not?
MARINA
Right away.
ALESSANDRA
Marina, someone’s looking for you
outside.
Who?

MARINA

ALESSANDRA
I Don’t know.
Where?

MARINA

ALESSANDRA
At the entrance.
Marina looks concern.

EXT. RESTAURANT ENTRANCE -- DAY
Marina walks towards the entrance. An attractive woman,
ADRIANA (45), is standing waiting for her.
ADRIANA
(holding a file in her
hands)
Good afternoon, Marina. Thank you
for coming out, this is just going
to take two minutes.
Hello

MARINA

ADRIANA
Hello. I’m Detective Adriana
Cortes, from the Investigations
Police’s Sexual Offenses Unit.
Good afternoon.

28

22.
They shake hands.
MARINA
Good afternoon.
ADRIANA
Well first of all, I wanted to
offer you my condolences. They told
me what happened, and I’m really
sorry. The fact that you run away
from the hospital, gave me some
reason for concern.
Marina feels uncomfortable.
MARINA
Could we talk over there?
ADRIANA
Of course...
They walk towards a more private place. They star walking.
MARINA
I didn’t run away.
ADRIANA
Oh. There must have been some
confusion, then.
MARINA
Could I see your identification,
please?
Sure

ADRIANA

Adriana show it to her. She really is a police detective.
ADRIANA (CONT’D)
One question. Mr. Orlando...
Onetto.

MARINA

ADRIANA
Yes. Was he paying you?
MARINA
(offended)
We were a couple.

23.
ADRIANA
So you cared for each other.
It wasn’t just sexual.
Marina begins to feel irritated.
MARINA
It was a consensual relationship
between two adults. Why do you want
to know that?
ADRIANA
Because he was old enough to be
your father.
(Marina holds back)
Did you use drugs before his
attack?
No.
Alcohol?
Yes.

MARINA
ADRIANA
MARINA

ADRIANA
Did you have sex?
MARINA
I don’t remember.
Long silence.
ADRIANA
I need to know if he suffered any
kind of physical stress.
MARINA
Nothing unusual.
ADRIANA
The thing is, Mr. Onetto’s body
arrived to the hospital with
injuries, with bruises. He had
injuries on his arms, on his sides,
on his neck. And a contusion to his
head.
Marina grows frightened. Adriana opens the file she has
brought along with her and shows it to Marina.

24.
There are pictures inside. Marina looks at them, then snaps
it shut, affected.

MARINA
I talked to the doctor about all of
this. Did you talk to his family?
Marina is confused. Alessandra appears at the door.
ALESSANDRA
Marina! Excuse me... We’re having
problems with the check for table
15.
MARINA
I’m coming.
ADRIANA
Five minutes, please.
(to Alessandra)
Alessandra goes back inside. Adriana fixes her gaze on
Marina.
Can’t anyone fill in for you?
(to Marina)
MARINA
No. And I really need to get back
to work... Or they’ll fire me.
ADRIANA
Look, I’ve been working on the
streets for 23 years. 14 years on
the Sexual Offenses Unit. I have a
Master’s degree on the subject. I
know very well what happens with
people... Sorry, with women like
you. Because I’ve seen it all. All.
Adriana carries on in her sensitive, condescending tone.
ADRIANA (CONT’D)
I want you to know that I
understand and support you.
Did you have to defend yourself
from him?
MARINA
Am I being arrested?

25.

No

ADRIANA

MARINA
Then I’m leaving, because I
really...
Adriana try to grab Marina’s hand.
ADRIANA
Wait, let’s do something.
(handing her a card)
Call me when you’re done here
so we can talk properly. So that I
can sleep tonight, okay?
Marina head back, Adriana follows her.
MARINA
Talk about what?
ADRIANA
I’ll be waiting for your call.
Marina is forced to nod her head. She puts the card away.
ADRIANA (CONT’D)
And it’s best if you don’t leave
Santiago.
(walking towards the
restaurant)
MARINA
Okay, goodbye.

Thank you.

ALESSANDRA

Marina and Alessandra watch her leave.

26.
ALESSANDRA (CONT’D)
Is everything all right?
MARINA
Yes, everything okay.
ALESSANDRA
I tried to rescue you, did you
notice?
MARINA
Yes, I noticed, thank you.
ALESSANDRA
Are you telling me what the fuck is
going on?
MARINA
Can it be some another time? I've
had a terrible day.
Sure.

ALESSANDRA

Alessandra nods, and Marina returns to her hectic job.

INT. ORLANDO’S CAR -- AFTERNOON

Marina, tired and humiliated, is driving Orlando’s car. She
arrives to the apartment and parks the car. Everything is
silence, she sees the ghost of Orlando. Her breathing becomes
heavy. She grabs from the floor a key with the number 181
written on it, her hands tremble. She gets down from the car
and whispers a song while he walks through the parking lot.

Marina looks very tired, she is on her pyjamas. She listens
to a voicemail Adriana left on her cell phone.

27.
ADRIANA
(on the phone, in a serene
tone)
Marina, this is Detective Cortes
speaking. I imagine you must have a
good reason for standing up an
Investigations officer. Now, I’m
not going to ask, I’m going to
demand that you come in and talk to
me tomorrow. I’ll be at the
Forensic Medical Service, look for
me when you get there, I’ll see you
at 12:30. Don’t call me. No
excuses. I’m not interested. Oh,
and please don’t make me
send someone to pick you up.

apartment. BRUNO (29) its in the hallway playing with Diabla.
Marina seems really surprise and upset.
BRUNO
Are you Marisa?
Marina
I’m Bruno.

MARINA
BRUNO

Awkward silence.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I thought there was no
one here.
Bruno walks toward the living room and Marina puts a sweater
on. She goes to the leaving room to meet with Bruno.

28.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
What happened, Marisa?
MARINA
Your dad suddenly started feeling
sick. Everything happened really
fast.
BRUNO
What were you doing?
Sleeping.

MARINA

BRUNO
(affected)
And that’s all? You were with him
and, he died? Just like that?
MARINA
We ran to the hospital.
BRUNO
His body was bruised. Why the fuck
was his body bruised? An injury to
his head.
MARINA
(affected)
He felt down the stairs
when we were going down. That’s
why.
Bruno notices the unopened boxes and suitcases.
BRUNO
What about those suitcases?
MARINA
I was moving in.
Shit.

BRUNO

Bruno gets down to pat Diabla.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
What are we going to do with you,
Diabla?
MARINA
Orlando gave her to me. I’m sorry.

29.
BRUNO
He gave you Diabla? That really
sucks.
Bruno stands up and walks through the apartment, he sits on
the leaving room. Marina stays standing.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
Look... I slept with this dog for
years. But I had to stop doing it.
I didn’t like the smell. Did you
know that there are two kinds of
people with pets? Those who have
mammals, and those who prefer birds
or reptiles. Mammals, we have a
neocortex. The most developed
layer of neural tissue, Where
emotions are generated. That’s
where empathy, tenderness... ...and
love are generated.
MARINA
(upset)
I don’t see anyone with a lizard
around here. I don't get you
analysis. Or are you trying
to say something else?
BRUNO
I´m not trying to say anything.
Aha.

MARINA

BRUNO
Have you gotten the operation?
MARINA
You can’t ask me that.
BRUNO
And why not? I don`t understand
what are you!
MARINA
I’m the same as you.
BRUNO
Yeah, sure...
(laughing)

30.
MARINA
(begging to leave the
leaving room)
Look, can we talk some other time?
I really...
BRUNO
(he stands up)
Wait, wait... I just need to know
when you’re moving out of this
apartment.
MARINA
I’ll let you know as soon as I find
something.
BRUNO
How much time are we talking about?
MARINA
A few weeks.
BRUNO
(he turns violent)
No, not a few weeks. Give me an
exact date or I’ll kick you out.
Marina faces him defiantly.
MARINA
You know what?
Go away from my house.
BRUNO
This isn’t your house.
Marina walks to the entrance and Bruno chases her. He grabs
her against the wall, Marina breathes heavily and Bruno
stares really close to her face.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
Incredible. My dad was crazy.
He let go of Marina and leaves.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
If you steal anything, I’ll know.
MARINA
Hey Bruno! My name is Marina. Bye.
Marina slams the door behind Bruno.

INT. ORLANDO’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- DAY

35

Marina wears a blue jeans dress, she stare at the mirror. She
grabs her purse that is on top of the bed, she sees again the
key with the 181 number written on it.
36

INT. ORLANDO’S CAR - CARWASH -- DAY

36

Marina’s car enters the carwash tunnel. The running water,
the dryers... It’s the closest thing she’s had to a peaceful
moment. Protected in this solitary space, Marina lets her
head fall back and closes her eyes. She sings quietly.
As the soap falls over the windshield, Marina looks back
through the rearview mirror: ORLANDO IS SITTING IN THE
BACKSEAT.
The spinning brushes run over the windows, making the car
dark. Marina can’t tear her eyes away from Orlando through
the rearview mirror; his face is hidden in the moving shadows
and lights.
Orlando now turns around and looks directly at her. Is she
losing her mind?
37

INT. GAS STATION STORE -- DAY
Overwhelmed, Marina covers her face with her hands as she
waits in line for the cash register. She fails to realize
that it’s her turn.
CASHIER
Miss...? Miss?
Marina snaps back. She advances.
MARINA
I’ve got to pay for the wash.
The CASHIER (30) takes a look at her exhausted, upset
demeanor.
CASHIER
You need a cup of coffee.
MARINA
(staring back at her)
Ok, one expresso.
CASHIER
How would you like it?

37

32.

Double.

MARINA

I/E. ORLANDO’S CAR / URBAN HIGHWAY -- DAY

38

Marina drives the now spotless car down a highway. Another
cathartic song is playing on the radio, at full volume.
“Natural Woman” performed by Aretha Franklin. Marina turns
onto a busy street. It’s an office buildings area. A DOORMAN
receives her, she pull down the window.
MARINA
Hi, good morning.
DOORMAN
Hi, good morning.
MARINA
I’m bringing this car to Sonia...
I don`t know her last name.
DOORMAN
Yes, Sonia Bunster. Yes, she told
me to inform her about your
arriving. Please park in the -4th
floor, parking space number 5.
She’ll come and pick up the car.
MARINA
She wants me to wait down there?
DOORMAN
Yes, that’s what she told me.
MARINA
Ok, thank you.
DOORMAN
You’re welcome, go ahead.
Marina continue driving.
39

INT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

39

The car is parked. Marina waits besides it for SONIA (48) to
come down.
sees a woman making gestures at her from the sidewalk. It’s
SONIA (48), attractive, with panache, dressed formally. They
size each other up in a glance.

33.

Hello

SONIA

MARINA
Hello, Sonia.
Sonia stares back at her, unable to react.
I’m sorry.

SONIA

They shake hands. But Sonia is still stupefied. Marina
responds with a gesture: this is me.
SONIA (CONT’D)
I've been wondering how is
your face for about a year, It's
different like this, face to face.
Of course.

MARINA

Sonia still can’t believe her eyes.
MARINA (CONT’D)
As you can see... bones and flesh.
SONIA
Yes, it’s just that... I can’t
imagine Orlando being with you.
That’s all.
Oh. Ok.

MARINA

SONIA
Don't treat me so formal.
MARINA
Eh... Here are the car keys.
Sonia receives them.
Thank you.

SONIA

MARINA
The documents are in
the glove compartment.

34.
SONIA
Ok. Excuse me.
(lamenting herself,
whispering)
Pure quantum physics.
Sonia checks inside the car, then emerges and opens the
trunk: it’s filled with color samples, books, and other
products from Orlando’s printing press.
Sonia slams the trunk shut, places both hands on the car, and
lowers her head. It truly is a difficult moment for her.
SONIA (CONT’D)
(without looking at her)
I don’t want to talk about the
apartment right now. Just move out
as quickly as possible.
MARINA
Okay. Thank you.
(sincerely)
Sonia, I’m so sorry about how
things turned out.
SONIA
(looking up at her now,
hurt)
Are you sorry for the whole soap
opera, or for this episode in
particular?
MARINA
For the way in which things
happened.
A look of frustration grows over Sonia’s face. She needs to
express what she’s feeling.
SONIA
Look, I was 38 years old when I
married Orlando. We were together
for 9. We were a completely normal
couple. We had a normal life...
(recalling, painfully)
So when he came and explained to
me... I... So then I thought
that... I’m sorry if it sounds
crude and direct of me to say this,
but I really think that this is...
just perversion.

35.
Marina feels loathing and compassion towards her at the same
time.
SONIA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, but... It’s that when I
look you, I don’t know what I’m
looking at.
Pause. Sonia knows that she’s crossing a line.
SONIA (CONT’D)
A chimera, that’s what I see.
MARINA
A chimera... Ok.
Marina is taken aback by the sentence.
I’m sorry.

SONIA

Both are completely engrossed by each other.
MARINA
There’s no need to be sorry. You’re
normal. You’re fine.
Marina begins to walk away. Sonia follows here to the
elevator. A MAN IN A GREY SUITE is standing there waiting for
the elevator to arrive.
Hi
Hi
Hi Sonia

MAN IN A GREY SUIT
MARINA
MAN IN A GREY SUIT

SONIA
Hi Pablo. How are you?
MAN IN A GREY SUIT
Im fine and you?
SONIA
Fine. Thank you
Good.

MAN IN A GREY SUIT

The elevator arrives and the three of them jump in.

36.
40

INT. ELEVATOR. DAY.

40

Marina, Man in a Grey Suit and Sonia are experience a awkward
moment on the elevator. Nobody speaks.
41

INT. LOBBY. DAY

41

Marina exits the elevator and Sonia follows here behind.
SONIA
(severely)
Is it clear to you that my 7 year
old daughter will be at the wake
this afternoon?
MARINA
Yes. And I would love to know
where it’s being held. I know how
to be discreet.
Sonia is shocked by the fact that Marina is even considering
the idea of attending.
SONIA
But don’t even think about going.
MARINA
I have the right to say goodbye to
him, too.
Sonia tries not to lose control.
SONIA
Look, it’s my problem now. You
already went through a hard time.
Now all the paperwork is up to me.
And in fact, I’d like to compensate
you for everything that you’ve
done. Really, so that you can be at
ease. You don’t need to go
anywhere, or do anything else. And
we’re going to handle this in a
civilized way, so we can both be
satisfied.
MARINA
I don’t need your money, ma’am. Did
you call Investigations Police?

37.
Marina is unable to read her.
SONIA
No. Well, in any case, I apologize.
I’m just looking out for my love
ones. That’s all.
MARINA
Orlando was a loved one to me.
SONIA
Yes, but you aren't coming to the
funeral. Or the wake. Do you
understand? I don't know how to
explain it to you. What you want me
to say? Daniel. You are not going
to the funeral... Or any place.
Marina can’t believe it. Marina looks at her fearlessly.
Sonia needs to be sure. She gathers strength in order to make
herself clear.
SONIA (CONT’D)
Please... Let us live this mourning
as a family. As it’s supposed to
be. Do not show up. I’m asking you
as a mother. Just think that
there’s an entire family,
devastated. In shock.
Sonia walks always and gets in the elevator.
SONIA (CONT’D)
I would give a lung for my
daughter.
42

INT. BUS -- DAY

42

Marina is on the bus. A brief pause in this battle.
43

EXT. FORENSIC MEDICINE INSTITUTE/ HALLWAY AND STAIRCASE- DAY
43
Marina and Adriana are standing at the entrance of the
Institute.
ADRIANA
Adriana, I wanted to apologize
for not calling...
Adriana is carrying her file with her.

38.
ADRIANA
Detective Cortes.
MARINA
Detective. I wanted to apologize
for not calling you last night, but
I was overwhelmed. I took some
sleeping pills.
ADRIANA
(interrupting)
It’s all right.
She walks inside the building. Marina follows her.
ADRIANA (CONT’D)
This way, please.
MARINA
Are we going to see Orlando’s body?
SONIA
No. I asked for a room and if I'm
late, I'll be in trouble.
MARINA
What do you need?
SONIA
The thing is, since you
didn't call me yesterday... Well, I
went over our conversation. The
toxicology exam came back with
positive results for alcohol... and
marihuana.
Marina starts to worry.
MARINA
Where are we going?
SONIA
We’re giving you a physical
inspection.
Marina stops in her tracks.
MARINA
No. No way.
ADRIANA
Don’t worry. It’s superficial.

39.
MARINA
But you never told me-ADRIANA
Look. I went to check on you
yesterday, I was worried. I gave
you an opportunity to tell the
truth and you lied to me. Then, you
failed to keep your promise and
left me waiting.
MARINA
Again, I apologize for not calling
you yesterday. That sleeping
pill... I’m sorry. About that other
thing...
ADRIANA
Look, what I need is to confirm
that you don't have any injures.
MARINA
But I don’t have any injures.
ADRIANA
Then there shouldn’t be a problem.
Adriana walks the stairs. Marina stops walking. Adriana turns
around.
MARINA
What? Why are you doing this to me?
ADRIANA
Because it's what corresponds. It’s
called a possible injuries
observation.
MARINA
Well, I refuse.
Adriana stops.
ADRIANA
(firmly)
Fine, I’ll file for a formal
request from the district attorney,
and that implies opening a file on
Orlando Onetto’s death.
Marina looks at her, enraged.

40.
ADRIANA (CONT’D)
Look, if you don't have
anything, this ends here. You go on
with your life. You decide.
Marina knows that she’s caught. She doesn’t respond.
44

INT. FORENSIC MEDICINE INSTITUTE - DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- DAY 44
The DOCTOR respectfully closes the door for Marina to take
her cloths of.
DOCTOR
I'm going to close this... So
you'll be comfortable.
While Marina undresses behind a screen, the Doctor and
Adriana make small talk in a low tone of voice. Marina
listens to the conversation.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Thank you for your help. You saved
me.
ADRIANA
We’re even now.
DOCTOR
You told me that her name was
Daniel? What should I call her?
ADRIANA
Don’t call her Daniel. Treat her
like a woman. Ask her what her name
is... but call her by her woman's
name.
DOCTOR
What did she do?
ADRIANA
I don't know, that's why we are
here.
DOCTOR
But is she involved in something
complicated?
Adriana and the doctor realize Marina is hearing the
conversation. Marina slips into the gown and emerges.The
doctor approaches Marina and guides her through the room.

41.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Ok. This way, please. What’s your
name?
Marina

MARINA

DOCTOR
That’s a pretty name, Marina. Could
you stand there, please? Thank you.
The doctor guides Marina and puts her in front of the wall.
He opens a drawer and pulls out a camera.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Marina, right? Marina. Please,
could you... could you uncover your
chest?
Marina complies. Her wide shoulders, her long hair, and her
flat, hairless chest are all exposed. The Paramedic takes a
picture of her.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
This will be really quick, okay?
Here I go. That’s it. Now please
raise your right arm. A little
higher. Yes. There. The same with
the other arm, please.
(he takes another picture)
Have you received any kind of
aggression... Blows, have you
fallen, anything like that?
No.

MARINA

DOCTOR
Are you sure?

Yes.
Ok.

MARINA
DOCTOR

(He doesn’t show so
convinced)
Well, now I’m going to ask you to
uncover your lower part.
(to Adriana)
(MORE)

42.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Could you please leave us so
that...?
No

ADRIANA

DOCTOR
I’m sorry. Could you uncover your
lower half? We’re almost done,
Marina.
Marina notices that Adriana doesn’t take her eyes off of her.
Resigned, she removes the hospital gown completely and stands
there, naked. The doctor takes another picture.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Could you please raise
your right leg, Marina? To the
side? There, there.
She complies, shocked by what she’s being required to do. One
last flash.
45

INT. FORENSIC MEDICAL SERVICE OFFICES - HALLWAY -- DAY

45

A humiliated Marina walks through the hallway of the Forensic
Medical Services. She heads out of the building.
46

INT. BUS -- DAY

46

Marina is riding a bus. It is packed with people, most of
them standing and holding onto a rail. She processes her
thoughts. It’s been too much...
47

EXT. PARK -- DAY

47

Marina walks through the park while he talks with Gabo on the
cell phone.
GABO (V.O.)
Hello, Marina. This is Gabo. I'm
sorry to bother you. Look... We’re
going to incinerate Orlando. It’s
what he wanted. And although Sonia
doesn't know yet...
...to be clear, this is my own
initiative. I wanted to offer
you...

43.

Ok?

MARINA

GABO (V.O.)
Some of his ashes.
Marina can’t believe what she’s hearing.
MARINA
Thank you, but no.
GABO (V.O.)
It's just that I feel
that you deserve them. Really.
MARINA
In exchange for not
showing up, Gabo?
GABO (V.O.)
I’d love for you to come. But...
MARINA
I'm eating right now.
GABO (V.O.)
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't want to
interrupt you.
MARINA
Gabo, I’m hanging up.
GABO (V.O.)
Hold on a second, we haven’t agreed
on...
Marina leaves Gabo talking and hangs up the phone.

48

INT. ELEGANT BUILDING -- DAY
Marina walks down the long hallway of an elegant building,
gathering her strength. She arrives at a door and knocks.
Someone opens.

48

44.
MARINA
Thank you for having me. I need it.
She enters. The door closes behind her.
49

INT. ELEVATOR - HALLWAY - SINGING COACH’S APARTMENT -- DAY 49
Marina gets off the elevator, takes a deep breath and knocks
the door. The door opens.
MARINA
Thank you for seeing me.
Come in.

50

SINGING COACH (V.O.)

INT. SINGING COACH’S APARTMENT -- DAY

50

Marina drinks coffee, as her SINGING COACH (65), grumpy and
walking with some difficulty, takes his seat at a piano.
SINGING COACH
Fucking gout.
MARINA
I can't believe that even your
illnesses are corny.
SINGING COACH
You look awful.
MARINA
You’re not wearing your glasses.
You can't see me from there.
He puts on his glasses.
SINGING COACH
You look... Awful.
Their closeness can be felt. He senses that she is unstable.
SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
Did you come here to improve your
technique, or to hide from the
world for a while?
MARINA
(knowing what’s coming
next)
Um... Both... and vice-versa.

45.
SINGING COACH
I have no problem with you coming
here too little or too late... or
whenever you need a little moral
support. But I’m your coach...
lyrical singing. Not salsa, or
Merengue. Lyrical singing.
Marina interrupts him. She knows that he’s right. And she
repeats something that we can sense they’ve talked over
several times.
MARINA
And you’re not my psychologist, and
you’re not my father.
No.

SINGING COACH

MARINA
What did I come for, then?
SINGING COACH
To sing I hope.
MARINA
To look for some love, maybe.
Having delivered his message, the Coach changes his tone, and
laughs at his own paternalistic attitude.
SINGING COACH
(he nods his head)
You can`t look for love.
MARINA
No. Not Saint Francis again,
please.
SINGING COACH
(Lauhgs)
Saint Francis doesn’t say. “Give me
love, give me peace, give me light,
give me this, give me that.” Saint
Francis says, “make me an
instrument of your love, make me a
channel of your peace.”
Marina draws closer to him. She plants a quick kiss on his
forehead. A sign of an old friendship.
SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
Sing a little bit for me.

46.
He plays Spossa son Dispraseta on the piano, and Marina
starts off with her vocal exercise. Once more, her voice is
moving.
51

EXT. STREET. DAY

51

We hear Marina singing Spossa son Dispraseta. She walks the
street alone, its really windy. As the seconds passes, the
wind grows stronger and carries all kind of dust. At some
point this natural force becomes so strong Marina can’t
continue walking, the wind stops her.
52

EXT. ORLANDO’S BUILDING - ELEVATOR -- DAY

52

Marina alone on the elevator, her mind is elsewhere. She
looks exhausted.
53

INT. ORLANDO’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM / BEDROOM -- DAY

53

Marina steps into the apartment. Her closed suitcases... She
stops when she notices an anomaly: Cigarettes, pizzas and
beer on the table of the living room.
Diabla!

MARINA

She looks for Diabla but doesn't find it. Marina pack her
suitcases and leave the apartment. While she heads out, she
makes a final call.
SECRETARY (V.O.)
Onetto Textiles. Good afternoon.
MARINA
I have a wreath for Orlando Onetto.
Could you tell me where
is the wake is being held?
54

EXT. ORLANDO’S BUILDING -- DAY
Marina waits on the sidewalk, next to her suitcases.
GASTON (39) and WANDA pulls up in front of her in his car,
Gastón hugs Marina.
GASTON
Take it easy, pretty.
Okay.

MARINA

54

47.
WANDA
Is this all you’re stealing?
MARINA
If you had a bigger car, I could
steal more.
GASTON
What? You two sisters are starting
already?
Gaston begins to load her things into the trunk. Wanda hugs
Marina.
WANDA
You’ll scare me to death.
MARINA
No. I’ll survive.
55

INT. GASTON AND WANDA’S CAR -- DAY
Marina rides in the backseat.
GASTON
(breaking the ice)
I think we should call the police.
What for?

WANDA

GASTON
Because it’s a crime. Strictly
speaking, it’s trespassing.
MARINA
No, I don't want any more police...
No more doctors, no more hospital
gowns, no more uniforms... I don't
want anything. It was Orlando’s
son. He wants me out of there,
fast. That's all.
GASTON
That’s not the point. It’s no way
to communicate.
WANDA
Oh please, Mr. Contradictions.
“That's not the point”. Stay out of
it!

55

48.
GASTON
What do you mean, stay out of it?
For over 9 years, I’ve been hearing
the same thing.
MARINA
Hey, I’m getting out of your house
as soon as I can, okay?
WANDA
No, it’s not that. Our house is
your house, always.
(to Gastón)
Always, right?
GASTON
Yes, always.
MARINA
Can I ask you for one last favor?
GASTON
Another one?
WANDA
(to Gastón)
Cut it out.
MARINA
Could you drop me off here, please?
The couple exchanges a worried glance. Gaston drives on.
WANDA
What do you want to do?
MARINA
I want my dog.
What for?

WANDA

GASTON
I don't think it’s a good idea
for you to do anything by yourself.
WANDA
No. Let’s wait until we get home.
There, we can smoke something. We
can relax, and then you can make
a more mature decision.

49.

OK.

MARINA

A red light. The car comes to a stop. Marina climbs out and
run away from the car. Wanda and Gaston call her out.
Marina!

WANDA

GASTON
Marina! Climb out!
WANDA
Why don't you climb out?!
GASTON
Because I'm driving.
WANDA
Okay... but...

56

INT. BUS -- AFTERNOON

56

Marina is riding the bus, indignantly. She looks angry and
decided.
57

INT. CHAPEL -- AFTERNOON

57

Marina opens the door and enters the chapel where Orlando’s
funeral is being held. She sees Sonia, Gabo and Bruno sitting
up front, close to the casket. Two TWENTY-YEAR-OLDS are
singing a song, accompanied by a guitar. They discover her
presence. The people inside the chapel, begin to mutter
amongst themselves and turn around to look at Marina.
Outraged, Sonia STANDS UP NOISILY, attracting everyone’s
attention.
SONIA
(shouting, very imposing)
NO ONE HERE SAYS ANYTHING!
Mom!

ORLANDO’S DAUGHTER

Everyone in the chapel freezes. The twenty-year-olds stop
singing. Everyone’s eyes are on Marina, who wishes she could
run out of there. A small girl --Orlando’s daughter?-- breaks
into hopeless sobs.

50.
Marina, affected by the girl’s sobbing, chooses not to insist
and begins to make her way towards the exit. The sounds of
her clicking heels echo loudly throughout the chapel. A woman
encounters her at the door and throw her out of the chapell.
WOMAN
Don't you have any respect
for others people pain? Get out of
here!

58

EXT. CHAPEL - FRONT YARD -- AFTERNOON

58

Marina walks towards the street, crossing the chapel’s front
yard without looking back.
Gabo appears, trying to catch up with her, but with little
success due to his orthopedic boot.
GABO
(honestly)
Marina... Marina, I apologize.
She doesn’t respond or stop walking.
GABO (CONT’D)
Everyone is a little upset. It’s
nothing personal.
Marina stops and confronts him.
MARINA
Saying goodbye to a loved one when
he dies is a basic human right.
GABO
I think you’re completely right.
MARINA
It’s done, Gabo. Go back inside.
Make sure you don’t fall.
She kisses him and leaves him behind.
59

EXT. UPTOWN STREET -- AFTERNOON
Marina is already a couple of blocks away from the chapel,
continuing to walk away.
A pickup truck begins to follow her, advancing at her same
speed.

59

51.
Marina grows unsettled, and she looks at it: Bruno is
driving, a MAN (40) is riding beside him, and a YOUNG MAN
(24) is in the backseat.
Marina looks away and keeps on walking. It’s better to avoid
conflict... She looks again.
MAN
Why did you come to disturb the
family?!
Marina holds back.
Marina exchanges a short glance with Bruno, who is just as
scared as she is.
MAN (CONT’D)
You were told over and over again
to leave us alone.
MARINA
What do you want?
Marina quickens her pace, accumulating rage. She tells
herself over and over again that it’s best to avoid conflict.
She looks at the Man.
MAN
We want you to get out of here,
you fucking faggot. What are you
looking at?
MARINA
You’re looking at me.
Marina holds back...
MAN
Are you threatening me faggot?
No.

MARINA

MAN
Go destroy families somewhere else.
You fucking monster! Hey! You
Fucking faggot. Stop the car! Stop!
You mother fucker!
Marina keeps on walking, blinded with rage. The truck stops.
The Man, the Young Man and Bruno climb out and violently grab
her. Marina tries to skirt them.

52.
MARINA
Let go of me, you coward! Let go of
me! What do you want?
MAN
You drive.
(to Bruno)
MARINA
You Fucking cowards! What do you
want?!
They struggle clumsily for a few seconds, and the two men end
up dragging Marina to the truck and pulling her into the
backseat. The doors slam shut... The truck takes off.
60

INT. PICKUP TRUCK -- AFTERNOON
Marina is sitting in the backseat, between the Man and the
Young Man.
MARINA
Where is my dog? What did you do to
my dog, you coward?
BRUNO
That`s not your house.
They pin her arms down, hard. Marina fights back.
MARINA
If you liked my dress so much, you
could have taken it, asshole.
YOUNG MAN
The mother fucker uses dresses!
MARINA
Let go of me!
YOUNG MAN
Did you cut your dick off? Did you
put it away?
MAN
Close your snout, it smells like
shit!

53.
YOUNG MAN
You think you’re Julia Roberts,
you piece of shit?
MAN
You wear a dress with
those football player legs?
Bruno looks uncomfortable with the situation.
MARINA
You have no right to touch me!
Do you think your dad would be
proud of what you’re doing to me?!
He would slap you if he saw you!
The Young Man pulls a roll of TAPE out from his backpack, and
together with the Man’s help wrap some tape around Marina’s
head, covering her mouth.
YOUNG MAN
Here’s your slap.
MARINA
You shouldn't have sent the police!
MAN
What police?
MARINA
Let go of me!
More tape is wrapped around her head, closing one of her
eyes.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Let go of me!
MAN
I can't hear you!
YOUNG MAN
Now talk, you motherfucker!

54.
MAN
Talk! You piece of shit!
Bruno turns around, he doesn’t like where the situation has
come to. Marina’s face is now deformed. Bruno keeps on
driving.

The pickup truck pulls over at a street downtown.
The backseat door opens and the Man climbs out. He pulls
Marina out of the vehicle and gives her a push.
MAN
I hope it`s clear now!
The Man climbs back into the truck and it takes off at full
speed.
Marina sits, she is in pain. She gets up and starts walking.
She draws closer to a parked car and sees her deformed face
reflected in a window. She cuts through the tape, ashamed,
crushed. She keeps on walking.

66

She discovers that ORLANDO IS STILL WATCHING HER, standing on
the dance floor, camouflaged in the crowd.
Marina begins to dance with even greater impetus, as
anonymous hands rise and surround her, cheering her on, which
then turns into...
A LONG AND COORDINATED GROUP CHOREOGRAPHY, vehement and
openly sexual.
67

INT. WANDA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT

67

Orlando’s funeral information in the newspaper.

What does it say?
WANDA
We announce the passing of our
husband, father, partner and
friend. Orlando Onetto Pertier.

56.
WANDA (CONT'D)
Funeral services shall be held
today at 16:30 at Parque de la Paz
cemetery. Ejército Avenue #315,
Santiago. His wife, brother, and
children...”
GASTON
(trying to change the
subjet)
Could you pass the avocado?
The sisters seem not to listen.
WANDA
Wait, listen... “We are deeply
saddened to announce the passing of
Orlando Onetto Pertier..." blah
blah blah... Onetto Textiles
employees.
GASTON
What’s the point? I don't get it.
WANDA
I’m reading.
GASTON
What for?
(to marina)
Don`t go. That would be masochism.
WANDA
Define to me what masochism is.
GASTON
People who like to suffer. Do you
like to suffer?
WANDA
What does that have to do with
this?
GASTON
I don`t like to suffer...

57.
WANDA
I’m just reading to my sister...
MARINA
Ok, stop it! Really, stop!
I'm not going anywhere. Okay? I’ve
turned the page. Okay? Life goes
on.
They seem not yo pay attention on what Marina just said.
WANDA
Why are you telling me what to do?

No, no...

GASTON

MARINA
(talking to herself)
What doesn't kill you, make you
stronger. Stronger.

Workers carrying A LARGE MIRROR.

The Workers continue on their way, unblocking a flashing neon
sign with an arrow in front of her: BAR.

Marina hands an OLDER MAN (60) his check.
OLDER MAN
(charming)
How much is it, darling?
MARINA
(handing him the check)
Here you go.
The Older Man searches for his money, but he can’t find any
in his wallet or in his pockets.
OLDER MAN
I’m losing everything lately. Do
you think it’s because of my age?
Marina smiles at him. The Older Man begins to pull everything
out of his pockets: his cellphone, some cigarettes, keys. He
finally finds some cash.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
Here we are.
Marina takes the cash, but she can’t take her eyes off of one
of the objects that the Older Man has set upon the table.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
What is it?
MARINA
I’m sorry. What’s that?
Marina points to a set of keys, one of which is a small key
that looks EXACTLY like the “181” key.

59.
OLDER MAN
It’s the key to my sauna.
Marina hides her amazement. The Waitress Friend observes
this, intrigued.
MARINA
To your sauna?
OLDER MAN
(smiling)
It’s the key to my locker at the
sauna just around the corner, the
“Finlandia”. Why?
MARINA
It just caught my attention. I’m
sorry.

INT. SAUNA - RECEPTION HALL -- DAY
Marina draws closer to the RECEPTIONIST (45), who is
concentrated on her papers.
MARINA
Is it co-ed?
The Receptionist nods, barely looking up at her.
MARINA (CONT’D)
But are the saunas separated
downstairs?
RECEPTIONIST
(sanctimoniously)
Of course.

79

60.
Marina sees another set of keys that look just like “181” on
her desk.
MARINA
How much is it?
The Receptionist hands her a price list. Marina pays and
heads downstairs quickly.
80

INT. SAUNA - CHANGING ROOM / HALLWAY -- DAY

80

In the ladies’ changing room, Marina takes her dress off. We
see her chest. She puts a towel on and looks for the key
inside her purse.
She emerges out into the hallway, trying to understand the
place’s logic.
She advances... and instead of entering the women’s steam
bath, she enters the men’s area, carrying the key in her
hand.
81

INT. SAUNA - HALLWAY / MEN’S AREA -- DAY

81

Marina makes her way across the men’s dark and steamy sauna.
She searches with her eyes, hidden in the darkness: she sees
a thin, naked man rinsing himself off with a hose, and a
sauna employee.
MARINA
Where can I find the locker?
EMPLOYEE
Over there.
82

INT. SAUNA CHANGING ROOM / LOCKER HALLWAY -- DAY

82

Marina enters the locker hallway and searches for the number.
She finally finds and stands before locker 181. Marina makes
a decision and slides the key in the lock. IT’S THE RIGHT
KEY. She opens the locker and discovers what’s inside...
NOTHING.
She observes the empty contents for a few seconds, defeated.

61.
83

EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN -- DAY

Marina runs through the streets. She pulls a taxi over and

(screaming)
Get out!
The man gets out.
MARINA (CONT’D)

Marina rides on the taxi.
84

EXT. CEMETERY PARKING LOT -- DAY

84

Marina walks through the cemetery parking lot, amongst cars
that are already on their way out.
A car approaches her from behind, honking: Bruno is driving,
Sonia is sitting beside him, and Gabo is in the backseat.
Bruno stops the car suddenly when he sees her. She turns
around and stands stiff.
BRUNO
Marina. What the fuck are you doing
here!
SONIA
The Ceremony is over, go home!
BRUNO
Could you please leave us in peace!
SONIA
Move, move! Crazy man! Move!
GABO
Sonia, she is a woman.

62.
BRUNO
She is not a woman.
Marina continues standing, she doesn’t pretend to move.
BRUNO (CONT’D)
Move! Move! Made-up faggot!
Marina impulsively puts one foot on the rear bumper and JUMPS
ONTO THE CAR’S TRUNK, THEN WALKS ONTO THE ROOF AND VIOLENTLY
JUMPS UP AND DOWN ON IT.
GABO
No, Marina, please don't do that!
MARINA
I want! My! Dog!
She then springs forward, letting herself fall onto the
windshield, beating on it with the palms of her hands.
Marina slides off of the car deftly.
Sonia screams while Bruno and Gabo observe this, frozen.
Marina walks to Bruno’s window.
MARINA (CONT’D)
Here you have Orlando`s keys...
She throws them inside. The car leaves. Marina is left on her
own in the parking lot.

a CLEANING LADY who is putting out a bunch of candles.
MARINA
Is this where Orlando Onetto’s
ceremony was held?
CLEANING LADY
I don’t know. I just clean here.
MARINA
Might you know where is he?

63.

No idea, m'am

Orlando enters an underground hallway. Marina follows him.
She takes a look around: piled up caskets, candle stumps, a
heap of wilting flowers, broken statues...
ORLANDO pushes her up against the wall behind her. Marina
tries to push him away in terrified silence, but Orlando
corners and kisses her.
But after a while, she gives in to a long and heartfelt kiss.
Orlando takes a few steps back. Marina, panting, brings one
hand up to her mouth. Orlando enters through a metallic gate.
She follows him and tires to open the door, its closed.
Marina dispairs.
MARINA
(shouting)
Open up!!
The door opens.
90

INT. INCINERATION ROOM -- DAY

Marina enters the incineration room, artless and technologic.
Two EMPLOYEES are with Orlando’s body on top of a metallic
sheet.

64.

Come in.
Thank you.

EMPLOYEE
MARINA

The EMPLOYEES leave and Marina walks to Orlando. He is with a
black suite. Marina holds his hand, she cries.
One of the EMPLOYEES comes back again. He enters the metallic
sheet on the dark cavity. The window closes and Marina,
undaunted, watches as Orlando’s body is disintegrated in the
fire.
