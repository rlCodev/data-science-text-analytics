NEW YORK CITY 1991

INT. NEW YORK CITY PRE-WAR APARTMENT - NIGHT

1

Mostly darkness in the small apartment, a few table lamps
illuminating a comfortable, crowded well worn space. On one
shelf, souvenirs from a past life: a framed NY Times Best
Seller list from 1980 with Kilgallen by Lee Israel
highlighted in the number 15 spot. Five or six copies of this
book, and a similar number of Miss Tallulah Bankhead (also by
Lee) and many more of Estee Lauder by Lee Israel line a
shelf. It’s a bit of a trophy case.
Across the room, a well worn cat tree sits in the corner,
piles of New Yorkers, and LEE ISREAL, around 50 and not
trying very hard, is asleep in her clothes on the couch. A
Blossom Dearie record spins on the record player, a cat
snoozes in her lap. Both snore. An alarm beeps on Lee’s casio
digital watch. Finally, she rouses. She looks down at her
watch which reads 10pm, and stops the alarm.
She moves to the kitchen, responding slightly to the music.
We imagine she may be getting ready for bed. She puts her a
plate in the sink, and returns. She downs her water from the
table and puts the glass into her purse. She takes a bottle
of scotch and also puts it into her purse. She turns off the
light, but then the front door opens, hall-light pouring in,
and we see Lee exit. The door slams shut.

INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Nondescript cubicles and the nondescript people who are
working in them. It is the graveyard shift and the YOUNG
EMPLOYEES are proofreading and black-lining law documents.
The large room is eerily silent save for the scratching of
pencils on paper and the sound of ICE CLINKING in a glass.
Lee is working as well, drinking a scotch on the rocks. She
swirls it around absentmindedly as she works without
enthusiasm.
TWO YOUNG WOMEN pass by her cubicle.
YOUNG WOMAN
(whispering)
Fucking kill me if I’m doing this at her
age.
Lee hears, and waits til she can’t see them.
LEE
I’ll kill you now if you ask nicely.

Embarrassed giggles. Swirling her glass of scotch, Lee works.
Someone shouts from another cubicle, head barely visible
CUBICLE WORKER
You know we’re not allowed to eat or
drink in here!
ANOTHER CUBICLE WORKER
(after a beat)
Yeah.
Lee ignores them. The first cubical worker tries to peer over
to Lee.
Hello?
Fascist.
Alcoholic.

CUBICLE WORKER
LEE
A THIRD WORKER (O.S.)

Some laughter. Lee goes back to her work, tries to
concentrate. She can’t.
LEE
(beat)
Why do you give a crap?
CUBICLE WORKER
Because the sound of the ice is driving
me insane.
MANY VOICES
Me too! It’s making me crazy!
LEE
Oh, fuck off.
She drinks, making as much ice noise as possible.
TALL MAN
What did you say?
LEE
I believe I said fuck off.
A tall MAN, 30, appears at her cubicle.
TALL MAN
I’m your boss. Pack up.

TALL MAN

He takes the document and other papers from her desk and
gestures for her to get up.
LEE
(quietly)
Please, I need this job.
He ignores her, watching as she puts her things into her
canvas bag (including her glass and bottle of scotch). He
walks behind her, ushering her out.
The young people in the cubicles watch with amusement as she
goes. Breaking into loose applause.

INT. CORNER MARKET - VERY EARLY MORNING
Straight from the job, Lee puts her groceries up on the
counter - cereal, peanut butter, a can of cat food. On the
small black and white TV a program with garishly wealthy
characters is playing. The CASHIER, 60s Asian woman, is
skeptical.
CASHIER
(she knows her)
How much have you got?
LEE
(fishing in her pocket)
Enough.
CASHIER
Show me first.
Lee counts out her disappointing amount of cash.
LEE
Okay, just this.
She separates the cereal and cat food and pays for them.
CASHIER
Put this other stuff back!
Lee walks out.

INT. LEE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - MORNING

Lee opens the cat food and places it in front of her cat
JERSEY, who’s not interested.
LEE
Since when did you become picky.
She puts the cereal on the counter and walks through her
cluttered apartment. Peeling paint, way too much stuff and
years of stacked up New Yorker magazines. The small one
bedroom apartment hasn’t been updated in at least 20 years:
paint is chipping, furniture is worn and scratched by
multiple cats, even the light bulbs need dusting. But you can
tell it was once a well-loved little box of a home.
The dining table is covered with papers and coffee cups and
empty wine bottles, leaving little room for the manual
typewriter and old computer.

INT. LEE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A few dead flies lie on her pillow. Disgusted, she brushes
them off and curls up to sleep in her clothes.
6

INT. LEE’S BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING

Broken shower tiles, an old moldy curtain. In the medicine
cabinet mirror, Lee smooths down her hair and applies
lipstick.
She notices the litter box in the corner is in unused,
pristine condition.

She notices a COAT GUY taking jackets, but she walks past him
in search of the bar.
Her host MARJORIE, 70 years old and sophisticated, sees her.
MARJORIE
Well, this is a surprise.
LEE
You invited me, did you not?
MARJORIE
You didn’t reply.
LEE
(ignoring that)
A coat check? At my party we threw coats
on a bed.
MARJORIE
Nice to see you too, Lee.
LEE
(beat)
You never call me back. I’ve got some new
ideas.
MARJORIE
This is why you’re here?
LEE
You don’t know what I’ve been doing just
to get by.
MARJORIE
Well, you’re here now. Try to enjoy
yourself, Lee.
Marjorie excuses herself.
ANGLE ON
The bar as Lee gratefully finds it.
She gets her drink and turns, walking through the crowd. She
overhears a conversation between TOM CLANCY, 40 famous
writer, and a crowd of eager followers.

TOM CLANCY
I don’t subscribe to the notion of
writers block.
FOLLOWER
You never experience it?
TOM CLANCY
Writers block is a term invented by the
writing community to justify their
laziness.
The crowd laughs.
TOM CLANCY (CONT’D)
My success is nothing more than that I
have the dedication and stamina to sit
and get the work done. It’s simple.
FOLLOWER
Having Ronald Reagan talking about you
doesn’t hurt.
Well sure.

TOM CLANCY

Lee passes the conversation, unimpressed.
LEE
(walking by)
Jackass.
FOLLOWER
Who’s that?
Tom Clancy shrugs, and Lee wanders, not knowing anybody.
People hustle by her, having a good time.
SEVERAL YOUNG GUESTS are huddled together and Lee eavesdrops.
KAREN
You have to read them. As an American.
GUEST
Well, sure.
Lee looks around, landing on SEVERAL OLDER PEOPLE sitting on
couches, not talking to anybody.
They line the perimeter of the room, sipping their drinks.
They’re old wallflowers.

INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

11

Lee walks down the hall that’s decorated with framed
photographs, book jackets, signed letters - it’s Marjorie’s
professional Memory Lane.
She glances up to assess TWO FRAMED BOOK JACKETS. One is
KILLGALLEN, by Lee Israel and the other is MISS TALLULAH
BANKHEAD also by Lee.
Unhappy with their placement, she quickly swaps them out with
a couple of frames that are closer to her eye line.
12

INT. MARJORIE’S POWDER ROOM - EVENING

12

Lee is snooping in the cabinet and finds a drawer filled with
almost finished toilet paper rolls. A dozen of them at least.
Weird.
She grabs the fullest one and drops it into her large bag.
She takes the bar of guest soap as well.

INT. MARJORIE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

She snakes her way through the party and makes it to the
front door just as Marjorie stops her.
MARJORIE
That was quick. Did you get properly fed?
LEE
This week. Will you take my call?
MARJORIE
(condescendingly)
Sure. We’ll see.
LEE
I have fascinating projects! I’m working
on a lot of ideas - I just need my agent
to call me back.
MARJORIE
(laughing to herself)
Well, nobody needs a new biography on
Fanny Brice, Lee. We may disagree on what
is considered fascinating.
She starts to walk away.
MARJORIE (CONT’D)
Good night Lee.

LEE
I just can’t figure it out.
MARJORIE
You went through my bathroom cabinets?
LEE
Just tell me. I’m curious.
MARJORIE
So that guests can have a full roll.
LEE
That’s batshit, Marjorie.
MARJORIE
(to herself)
You would know...
At the coat check Lee points to a very sophisticated, long
wool coat.
LEE
Yeah, I lost the ticket, but that’s the
one.
The coat check guy doesn’t flinch, but hands it to her.
COAT CHECK GUY
Have a good night, ma’am.
Lee takes the beautiful coat with a smirk.
14

INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

14

Lee sits on her couch, drinking scotch, with her new coat
slung over the couch. On the TV Lillian Hellman’s black and
white film THE LITTLE FOXES plays. It’s a scene Lee knows by
heart, but that doesn’t stop her from enjoying every frame.

Bette Davis is snuffing candles whilst quibbling with her

LEE
(along with the TV)
There are lots of things to consider.
After all, they are first cousins.
(then answering herself)
Well that isn’t unusual. Our grandmother
and grandfather were first cousins.
(back again)
Yes and look at us!
She removes some appetizers from her purse, shoves one into
her mouth and offers one to the cat.
LEE (CONT’D)
Jersey, here girl!
The cat wanders over but doesn’t eat them. Lee is concerned.

Lee is at the counter, holding a cat carrier and talking to
the assistant RACHEL.
RACHEL
You still have a balance, Ms. Israel.
LEE
But there’s something wrong with her.
She’s very old.
RACHEL
I’m sorry. The doctor told me to get at
least half the balance before we do any
tests.
LEE
Don’t you take a Hippocratic oath or
something? Don’t you have to do

You owe us eighty two dollars.

GLEN
Just these.
That’s it?

LEE
I schlepped them all the way

GLEN
(dismissive)
I’ll give you two dollars. I don’t want

He goes to the cash register to pay her.
LEE
Come on, man. I don’t need much. I just
don’t want to carry them around.

I’ve got a sick cat and I need the money.
Please.
GLEN

You rude little ape. What have you ever

She turns to leave.

Lee drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. She glances
briefly at a framed letter on her wall. Reluctantly, she goes

letter from Kathryn Hepburn. Lee sighs. She knows what she
has to do, but she doesn’t like it.
She takes the letter off the wall.

Good afternoon, darling. Can I have a

Jack quickly pulls out a twenty and puts it on the bar. Craig
goes to get the beer. Jack recognizes Lee.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

32

Lee is sitting on the subway with a Bendels bag in her lap.
She’s reading a book about Fanny Brice.
A LITTLE GIRL (7 years old) is standing in front of her,
staring at her. Lee tries to ignore her but eventually looks
up at the kid. They stare at each other.
LITTLE GIRL
Are you a man?
LEE
Are you a gargoyle?
The STARTLED MOTHER yanks at her daughter’s arm and pulls her
away. Lee goes back to her book.

INT. MS. WHITMAN’S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - SAME DAY

33

Lisa is showing Lee how to record things in a log book.
LISA
So you have to account for how you spend
your time each day. If you make a phone
call for her, write it here. If you make
a phone call for yourself, write it
there.
LEE
Is this for real?
LISA
What do you mean?
LEE
Everything I do, I write down?
Yes.

Ms. Whitman pays what she thinks is fair,

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE OF CROSBY STREET BOOKSELLERS - DAY

A34

Across the street, Lee stands in a phone booth as Jack hands
her the sheet of paper from the night before, with the list
of names from the buzzer. She puts in a quarter and dials.
As Lee speaks, they watch the front of the store.
LEE
(in thick Long Island
accent)
Hello, I’m looking for the tall guy, the
book buyer, Glen. Oh, hello, thank god!
This is Lillian Schuster from the fourth
floor. There’s an emergency! The
building’s on fire. We’re all outside! Oh
my god it’s horrible!... no, they’re not
letting us back in! You better come over
and get your dog! I see flames coming out
of your window right now! I think I hear
the poor thing squealing!
They watch as Glen frantically trips out of the store and
runs up the street. They crack up, gratified.
JACK
That was very enjoyable.
LEE
Thoroughly.

She’s so cute!

Unless she’s shredding the side of my

The receptionist, Rachel, calls out.

Lee gets up and goes to the counter.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Hi, Ms. Israel. Are you’re able to pay

LEE
That’s why I’m here.

Are you sure you want to use success two

Excuse me?

MS. WHITMAN

LEE
(reading)
‘Clearly a success and succeeded.’
MS. WHITMAN
I’m sorry, did I ask you for advice?
LEE
I just thought MS. WHITMAN
I have a Masters degree in English, Lee.
LEE
And I’m a published author, Ms. Whitman.
Whitman sighs deeply, thinking she’s being mocked.
MS. WHITMAN
Can we continue, please?
Of course.

MS. WHITMAN
Lee, I need you to balance Natalie’s

LEE
Your teenager.
MS. WHITMAN
Yes, I’ve opened an account for her. She
needs to learn responsibility.
LEE
By me balancing her checkbook?
Ms. Whitman looks at her, coldly considering her.
MS. WHITMAN
If you want to borrow a book, simply ask
before handling it.
LEE
I mentioned that I was a published
author. This is my book.
Ms. Whitman inhales.
MS. WHITMAN
I get the sense you’re not very happy
here.
I’m giddy.

MS. WHITMAN
You’re sarcastic and impolite.

Lee enters the bar, looks around, and sees Jack a few stools
away. She sits away from him.
JACK
I rang you and you didn’t ring me back.
Should I take it personally?
LEE
Why wouldn’t you?
JACK
I’d never get out of bed.
LEE
And lucky for me, you did.
She’s somewhat entertained by him, in spite of herself.
JACK
I’m coming to sit next to you because I’m
not very good at social cues.
He moves next to her and Lee speaks to Craig, the bartender.
LEE
Scotch, water, Craig. And I’ll buy his
next one.

INT. LINCOLN CENTER LIBRARY - DAY

The table is covered with articles and books. Lee is taking
notes on a pad.
She separates some papers and finds TWO TYPED LETTERS SIGNED
BY FANNY BRICE. Her eyes widen.
She looks around - to let someone know the letters don’t
belong here - and then she changes her mind.
She reads them with a kind of secret thrill.
She glances around the room, relieved that no one is looking
her way. Quickly, she drops the letters into her canvas bag.

I’m glad to hear you’re writing another

you hear Tom Clancy is going to get paid
3 million dollars to write more rightwing macho bullshit? What is the state of
the literary world?
LEE
Are you kidding me? That blowhard is
getting paid three million dollars?
Anna is taken aback by Lee’s reaction.
LEE (CONT’D)
Everyone thinks they can be a writer, I
guess. Oh to be a white male, who doesn’t
know he’s full of crap, huh?

Oh - I totally agree. Why do we celebrate

MARJORIE
Lee - I’ve had too long a morning already
for this.
LEE
He’s a fraud.
MARJORIE
What is your point?
LEE
He was drinking sherry at your party. No
self-respecting writer would drink
sherry.
MARJORIE
Oh lord, Lee.
LEE
I need an advance for my Fanny Brice
book. I need you to get me ten thousand
dollars. I am months behind in my rent

Toni, can you please close the door? Ms.

The door closes behind Lee.
LEE
I’d hate for her to hear a grown up
conversation.
MARJORIE
I’ll give you three reasons. Number one
Tom Clancy’s famous.
LEE
Well here we go.
MARJORIE
I can’t get an advance for you because
nobody has ever heard of you- you’ve
written some successful biographies,
sure, and you disappeared behind your
subjects, but that means nobody knows who
you are!
LEE
Because I did my job!
MARJORIE
Number two - Tom Clancy goes on every
radio show, on Larry King, to every book
signing and he plays the game, he
hobnobs. Meanwhile, you’ve burned every
bridge I’ve made for you. You’re
impossible to work with and everybody
knows it.

I had a book on the New York Times best

I’ve known you a long time, Lee. It hurts
me to have to say this all to you.

I’m just trying to survive.

Brice letter sitting nearby, taunting her.
She picks up the Fanny Brice letter and compares the
typeface. It matches.
She zips the sheet from the typewriter and rolls the Fanny
Brice letter into it. She scrolls down and adds a P.S.
P.S. I have a new Grandkid, and he got my

Dear Sidney,
I had no idea you knew Dottie Parker. A
tragic loss but she has been dying for
decades. Whether it was drink or
chemistry or character, she was unable
after a time to write anything and that
made her sere and infinitely pathetic. My
own friends are dropping like flies and I
am thankful of late when they live

A SECURITY GUARD surveys the room, Lee approaches the
LIBRARIAN behind the counter.
YALE LIBRARIAN
Can I help you?
LEE
I’m doing an in-depth look at writers and
alcoholism. Hence - Lillian Hellman.
Here’s the contract with the publisher.
Lee places a piece of paper in front of the woman. It’s a
contract that Lee has clearly forged, but it looks real.
LEE (CONT’D)
Since there’s already a great deal
written about her, I’m interested in the
more personal, archival material. Any
kind of correspondence, journals, diaries
- would be ideal.
YALE LIBRARIAN
I’ll give you what we’ve got.

In the back of the shop, Paul stands by as the FBI agent

him one of the Clara Blandick letters.

Look familiar?
PAUL
Yes, I bought this one from her.
AGENT SOLANAS
(re: photo of Jack)
What about this guy? Have you ever bought
from him?
Of course, Paul recognizes him.

Oh, I doubt it.

Lee sifts through Lillian Hellman’s personal letters, all
signed by the author.
She removes a notebook, and while pretending to take notes,
begins to copy the letters word for word.
Lee turns, feeling like she’s being watched. Sure enough, a
security guard is eyeing her. She smiles and he looks away.
Lowering her head, she slowly and very carefully tries her
hand at the signature.

JACK
I might for the right man. What’s your

Kurt glides around the apartment inspecting it.
KURT
A lot cleaner! What is all this? Why do
you collect typewriters?
JACK
It’s too complicated to explain. It’s for
my work. I don’t bring many people to my
home. It’s my safe space. I’m very
private.
Kurt glances at the upended TV set/light box.
KURT
Guess you don’t watch a lot of TV.

Slowly, she slips the originals into her tall boot and then

Has she been caught? They both stare. Nobody breathes. Lee
smiles. Having been previously snubbed, the woman smirks and
looks away.
Heart pounding, Lee rises, picks up the boxes and heads to

get overly anxious when I’m traveling.

hiding behind these people, their names.
Because if I’d actually put myself out
there, done my own work, then I would be
opening myself up to criticism. And I’m
too much of a coward for all of that.
I’ve lost my cat- the only soul that
truly loved me, maybe ever- and I lost my
friend - who might have been an idiot,
but tolerated me, and was nice to have
around. And I’ve realized that I’m not a
real writer. In the end, it was not worth
it.
This hits Lee in a surprising way. Lloyd looks at her
nervously. She returns to her script.
LEE (CONT’D)
I will accept the judgement of the court
as valid and fulfill whatever sentence I
may receive with the full understanding
that I have earned said punishment.
A moment. The judge nods.
JUDGE
Lee Israel, the court sentences you to
five years probation plus six months
house arrest. You may only leave home to
go to and from your place of employment,
your work in the community, and to
alcoholic’s anonymous meetings.
LEE
(blurting)
I don’t have anywhere to go.
JUDGE
You are not to leave the state or consort
with felons and you are to pay
restitution to your victims within your
means.
Lloyd grins at Lee, nodding. Lee stares, in disbelief.
LLOYD
(quietly to Lee)
This is a good thing. Very fair.
But Lee is reeling. The weight of everything is finally
settled on her, and it is heavy.

INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY

151

Lee enters her apartment. It is eerily empty. No typewriters.
No Jersey. No Jack. Jersey’s empty food bowl sits on the
floor, taunting Lee. She checks her answering machine but has
no messages. She collapses onto the couch. She does not know
where she will go from here.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Lee sits on a bench waiting. After a moment she sees ELAINE,
45, coming toward her.
LEE
Thanks for coming.
ELAINE
It sounded important.
LEE
It was. It is. My phone got shut off. In
case you tried to call.
I didn’t.

ELAINE

They sit down and Elaine notices the cat hair on Lee’s
jacket, picks at it.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
I see you brought Jersey with you. How is
that old bitch?
LEE
That’s what I wanted to tell you, Elaine.
She just died.
Oh.

I’m so sorry, Lee.
LEE

I got too attached to her.
ELAINE
You going to get another?
LEE
No. I can’t replace her. It wouldn’t be
right.
ELAINE
Maybe in time.
LEE
I do go to Aunt Eleanor’s pretty
regularly.
ELAINE
Oh god, I haven’t thought about that
place in years! It’s still there? On
96th?
LEE
Exactly the same. Different cats.
ELAINE

You still on 82nd?
LEE
Where else would I be?
ELAINE
You look all right. You all right?

You can’t imagine what I’ve had to do to

Maybe. I can’t remember the last time I

Elaine examines Lee, concerned.
ELAINE
Are you sleeping, Lee?
This bit of kindness hits Lee.
LEE
Fits and starts. But when you can’t
recognize your own life it’s hard to find
rest.
ELAINE
You’re having one of those times. You
just gotta ride it out.
LEE
I was supposed to be something so
different than this. Wasn’t I? When we
were together, people liked my work
right?
ELAINE
That’s why you wanted to see me?
LEE
No. I mean... I’ve wanted to see you for
a long time. I’ve needed to see you,
Elaine. I just... I’m in a crisis. And
you know me.
ELAINE
It always seemed more important to you
that people liked your work than that
they liked you.
LEE
Well, of course.
ELAINE
No, Lee. That’s not healthy.
LEE
I guess not. ButELAINE
You were so miserable.

No I wasn’t.

Yes you were.

LEE
I was happy with you.
ELAINE
Well, I appreciate that. We were happy
there. For parts of it.
LEE
It was more than parts of it.
ELAINE
No, Lee. There was always a wall between
us. Something I couldn’t penetrate.
LEE
I tried. God damnit. I tried more with
you than with anyone ever.
ELAINE
No you didn’t. You did everything you
could to keep your distance. You lied,
you drank constantly, you were selfinvolvedLEE
Well, I didn’t say I was perfect.
ELAINE
And the moment anyone wronged you, you
cut them out. It was like you were
looking for everyone to fail you, so you
wouldn’t have stay connected.
LEE
Well fuck. I always thought of myself as
pleasantly prickly.
ELAINE
More like a fortress of disdain. I could
never get you to let down the wall- to
trust me- and at some point I just
stopped trying.
LEE
I wish you hadn’t.

I don’t know why you were so afraid for
anyone to get to know you - maybe you
thought nobody would like what they saw.
Such a shame.
This takes Lee by surprise. Elaine starts to stand up, Lee
grabs her arm.
LEE
Wait - don’t go.
ELAINE
This isn’t my job anymore, Lee. To talk
you off the ledge. It’s exhausting.
LEE
Who is she?
Elaine sighs, she was trying to avoid this.
Lee.

ELAINE

LEE
I’m just curious.
ELAINE
She’s a public advocate. She’s warm and
it’s simple.
LEE
Is she always a cunt to your old friends?
I wouldn’t let her answer the phone if I
were you.
ELAINE
And there it is. I don’t know why I try.
(she makes a motion of a
wall going up)
You’re never going to change. Everyone is
always wronging you - nobody appreciates
you, nobody gives you what you
deserve....

And nothing is ever your fault.
Lee is stunned.

Lee lies in bed, staring up at the fan. She isn’t filled with
anxiety anymore. She is numb. She is lifeless, replaying
Elaine’s words in her head. She pulls out Anna’s short story
and begins to read.

Lee walks past Anna’s bookshop. She sees Anna inside, talking
to a customer. She knows she can’t go in. She stops and
watches though. Suddenly Anna looks up and the two women make
eye contact.
Anna breaks it and when she looks back up, Lee is gone.
Sadly, Lee walks away.

Lee sits at a table - she doesn’t look good but she doesn’t
look bad either. Craig brings her a scotch.
CRAIG
Haven’t seen your face in here in a
while.
LEE
Yeah well, I’m only allowed to leave the
house for my AA meetings.
Craig walks away shaking his head. Suddenly the door opens
and Jack comes in. He sees Lee, approaches her table. Is this
a coincidence? Jack looks a little thin, and walks with a
crutch, babying one foot.
LEE (CONT’D)
Thanks for coming.
JACK
(shrugging)
It was quite inconvenient. I had to move
around some meetings, but I had my
assistant cancel my afternoon.
Lee smirks. It’s kind of Jack to make this easier.
LEE
Can I get you a drink? I’m buying. I’ve
started counterfeiting money now.
She smirks, this tickles Jack.
JACK
Not today.
(off Lee’s surprise)
It’s my new meds. Throwing my whole
system off. Gin tastes like mouthwash.
Takes the fun out of it.
Lee is concerned, but doesn’t press.
LEE
I guess you were able to cut a deal?
Ratting on me worked out?

Three years probation.

I couldn’t imagine what was so important
that Lee Israel swallowed her pride and
asked me to meet her. So spit it out.
LEE
I’m reconsidering.
JACK
Oh just tell me.
LEE
Well... I’ve been thinking about writing
a new book. About what happened. About
what I did. And about you, if you’ll let
me.
JACK
Like hell I will! What would my boyfriend
think if he knew about my shadier
dealings?
LEE
Do our crimes even count in your top ten
of shady dealings? I doubt it.
JACK
Fair enough. But I don’t want a book out
there about me. I’m a very private
person.
Lee is quiet.
LEE
I have to do something. I have to write
again.

What about Fanny Price?

I’m still mad at you, you know. You

you’re a very nice person.
LEE
I would agree with you.
JACK
But I suppose you may be mad at me as
well.
LEE
If you didn’t look quite so decrepit, I
would be.
JACK

Yes, well. I guess it’s not some huge
plot twist. It was going to catch up to
me eventually.
LEE
You have fucked your way through
Manhattan.
JACK
I would like that on my tombstone.
They share a morbid laugh.
JACK (CONT’D)
With the addition of: but he steered
clear of the boroughs.
Sure.

Will you make me 29? And with perfect
skin? And don’t make me sound stupid?

Thank you.
Lee reaches out and touches Jack’s hand. This lingers for
just a moment and then Jack stands, breaking it.
JACK
I’m late for a board meeting. My driver
is waiting. The life of a millionaire.
They both smile, going with the bit. Jack starts toward the
door. Crossing in front of Lee. Lee stifles a little laugh.
Jack looks back...
What?

JACK (CONT’D)

LEE
No... I was so tempted to trip you, just
now.
Jack laughs, against his better judgement.

Wow, you’re ... a horrid cunt, Lee.

My friend’s birthday is coming up and

BOOKSELLER
She’s a beauty, isn’t she?
LEE
Can I ask how much a letter like that
runs?
BOOKSELLER
We’re asking nineteen hundred, framed and
matted, and she comes complete with a
letter of authenticity.
Lee’s eyes widen.
LEE
Does the letter of authenticity come with
a letter of authenticity?
BOOKSELLER
Oh, I can assure you. It’s the real
thing. No one can write like Ms. Parker
could. Not before and not since.

Lee sits at her old typewriter (the one she already owned),
and writes.
LEE’S VOICE
My dear sir, I offer my droopy
salutations from the Great Beyond. I
understand that you’re selling my
personal letters to the tune of nearly
two grand. To think poor Lee Israel
received a tiny fraction of that sum when
she sold them to someone, who then sold
them to you.

We see the man through the front window, reading this letter.
He looks into the distance, considering. Disturbed, he moves
to the shop window.
LEE’S VOICE
I dearly hope this letter will not affect
the selling price of your valuable
artifact. As I most famously muttered
mere moments after my cremation:
“Darling, excuse my dust.”
Yours,
Dorothy Parker.
The bookseller removes the letter from the window display.
And then decides to put it back.
