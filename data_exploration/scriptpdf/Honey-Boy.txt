HONEY BOY

Shia Labeouf

EXT. WRECKED AIRPLANE ON A WRECKED SET - AFTERNOON
Scrap metal parts: everything that can’t be salvaged. GIANT
green screens are located at key points. Black smoke.
OTIS LORT (22) looking into the camera. He’s laser focused
and fine-tuned like an owl statue.
CLOSE ON: Otis registers a threat. We can’t see it. But it’s
no good - he holds up his hands, terrified.
OTIS
No... No, No.... No. No, no...
ON INVISIBLE IMPACT - RAMP SPEED: Blood flies, Skin ripples.
Otis is ratcheted hard across a flipped car, EXPLOSIONS go
off on cue all around him. Debris and black smoke everywhere.
And... CUT. We see the DIRECTOR getting excited about the
shot in a hand held monitor.
Otis gets lowered to the ground still tied in a harness.
The Stunt Coordinator arrives and sprays the set and Otis
with foam. 2nd A.C. enters with the sticks.
Otis walks back up to reset. He looks into the camera to do
it all over again.
Frame up on the slate: 2005
TO BLACK.
INT. WRECKED SET - LATE AFTERNOON
We’re over Otis's shoulder, walking stiffly through
production in a body harness he can’t remove.
As he walks towards his trailer we see flashes of various
ACTION SCENES he’s filmed for the movie.
- Shirtless and fist-fighting in a dark trailer... and CUT.
- Breaking out of jail through an underground tunnel... and
CUT.
- Wandering through the desert holding a shotgun... and CUT.
Until he reaches his trailer.

2.
INT. STAR WAGON TRAILER - EARLY EVENING
Door opens. Light switch. Otis enters his plushy trailer.
Fruit basket. Chandelier. It looks neat.
Otis is a mess.
He is still in his body harness. He puts his fingers in his
mouth to calm himself the way we learn later he did when he
was a kid. Like a pacifier.
He sits back but his back gets pinched by the harness. He
jumps forward and reaches for the back strap.
He can't get it. He tries again. Nope.
He grabs a bottle of water and takes a sip. A breath. Shakes
his arms. Leans forward and tries again. He touched it. He
touched the strap!
He stops. New plan.
He finds room in the middle of the trailer, bends down starts
swaying with his arms around his back, trying to catch the
strap. Left, Right. Fuck... Almost.
He takes a break.
Looks for his pack of smokes. Can’t find them. He opens a
gift basket and pulls out a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. He downs a
third of the bottle. He opens the fridge, closes it before he
looks inside and runs out of the trailer...
Our shot remains locked off.
OTIS (O.S.)
ANYBODY GOT A WALKIE! FUCK ME!
We see the water in a glass on the table settle. We watch the
chair stop spinning. Then we hear Otis run past us the other
way. His breathing has quickened. We hear him punch the side
of the trailer in frustration. BANG!
OTIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I’m in this fucking... You fuckers
lit me on fire and left me in a
vice!!!
He storms back in the trailer and leans forward. Stretches
his arms in front of him and slowly brings them around. He
starts swaying again. Left and Right. Left and Rightttttt....
Fuck.

3.
Otis kicks the stove again. He punches it again and again.
Beat.
Guilt. He tries to fix the bent metal.
He sits on the couch and looks at it. He stands up and opens
the trailer door. He props the door open and sits on the
stairs. He fold his arms. He’s uncomfortable. He stands up
walks back in but realizes he got caught on the door. He
tries to swing out.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I’M HERE!!! I’M ALONE IN HERE!!!
AND I CAN'T REACH THE THING-FUCK!!!
We see his hand go white as he grips the door rail. He
manages to get off the door and goes to the bathroom mirror.
He looks down and is about to break. He runs the water and
wipes his face, sits on the bed.
He rises, walks back to the door and dents it with his fist
as we flash to more scenes from the film.
Otis’s character:
- Slammed against a police car over and over again.
Screaming.
- Wiping a shotgun clean in a blood red lit room.
- Fighting or flirting or maybe both, in a bath tub with a
beautiful young actress... and CUT.
BACK TO:
INT. STAR WAGON TRAILER - EARLY EVENING
Otis enters, leans his forehead on the top drawers.
He breathes. For a long, long, long time. His breath purrs
like when you’re about to cry. He picks up the Whiskey bottle
and downs half of it.
He feels inspired.
If he rotates his shoulder counter-clockwise, over his hip
and can get the weight off his right leg... The bed.

4.
He lays in the bed and reaches behind for the strap while
pushing his foot onto the wall of the trailer for leverage
and leaning on the edge of the bed wedged in the passageway
of the trailer. He pushes... He rotates His body and sits up
with a red face...
Knock knock.
His co-star SANDRA (20’S) enters the room.
She’s perceptive and kind. You also get the feeling that this
girl knows everything in the world, in the best way. The
intelligent way. Good at helping others way.
Ready?

SANDRA

She sees him. He’s struggling on the couch out of breath.
She walks over and in one casual movement releases him.
He’s free.
She leans right in for a kiss. It’s fire.
He falls back with her on the bed and they open a new cycle
of breathing and pushing around the room. He tries to get her
out of her shirt. She tries to get him out of his... Somehow
despite all the passion involved it looks like the harness
battle.
INT. CHEVY SILVERADO - STREET - NIGHT
HONK HONK!
Close on Sandra’s hand pushing the horn as Otis drives.
Come up to find them in the car. Otis in the driver’s seat.
They’re passing an EXTRA SMOKEY BLUNT. It’s thick. Her legs
are on the dashboard.
They are now passing back a lit half cigarette. Otis drops
it. He steers with his knees as he looks down to find the
smoke.
BANG.
RAMP SPEED: A Toyota Tacoma hits the breaks hard just as it
makes a FULL IMPACT at 70 mph, causing the front end to go
low. This shovels the truck, sending it up and over.
Everything goes silent.

5.
The whole world turns upside down. Otis holds onto the window
frame and Sandra as they corkscrew through the intersection.
One flip. Two flips. Three flip. IMAPCT.
Airbags.
UPSIDE DOWN - Otis is barely conscious. He looks at his hand.
The TWO FINGERS he always puts in his mouth are covered in
blood.
EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Otis gets bumped against a police car while being arrested,
except this time it’s real life. He struggles and fights but
they’re holding his head down.
OTIS
WHAT AM I BEING ARRESTED FOR??
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Otis is arrested in the back seat.
Otis is screaming at the cops behind the steel mash cage.
OTIS
You think you’re fuckin’ hot shit?
Cause you doooooon’t know how good
I am at what I do!
They ignore him.
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
Total darkness. Otis is terrified.
OTIS
Why am I here? Come on! Answer the
question you dumb fuck! Why am I
hear? Answer the question!
INT. CAR - THE NEXT DAY
Otis’s mom LINDA is driving.
He stares out the window, his face cut in several places.
He’s wearing a hoodie and baseball cap and can’t bring
himself to look at her.

6.
INT. REHAB WATSONVILLE - COMMON AREA - SUNSET
Beautiful light from every window.
Otis is terrified.
He’s asked to take his shoes off. People mill about the house
in pajamas. Holding board games and staring at him.
A black man is knitting a scarf. They exchange looks.
We follow Otis and the R.S. upstairs and through a hallway.
We walk through the door to a medical examination room.
INT. REHAB - EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A locked MEDS CABINET.
Otis strips behind a curtain and hands his clothes to the
R.S. He gets searched and they take his phone and his bags.
After the clothes are looked through he is handed them back.
INT. REHAB - TREATMENT OFFICE - DAY
There is big mural of a forest. A small cactus on a little
table. A white board with twelve names, small colored dots
next to each name, with weekly numbers of the S.U.D.S
(Subjective Units of Distress Scale), and treatment profiles.
Otis sits in a swivel chair.
DR. MORENO (late 40’s), small woman with a no bullshit
presence, adds his name on the board and goes back to her
chair. She tries to sit but her back is not making it easy.
DR. MORENO
There are no guards on the premise
Otis.
I noticed.

OTIS

DR. MORENO
But since this is your third
drunken altercation with the
police, if you leave we have to
notify the judge and you’ll serve
those four years... That’s the
deal.
Right.

OTIS

7.
DR. MORENO
So where do we start?
OTIS
I don’t know boss. You tell me. I’m
obviously not equipped to make any
decisions... I’m an ego maniac with
an inferiority complex...
DR. MORENO
Let’s try again.
OTIS
How about? I’m a professional
schizophrenic... What do you want
me to say? I’m a piece of shit.
Dr. Moreno looks at him for a minute.
Otis’s eyes are terrified and his body is wired.
She turns around on her chair. It’s painful. She pulls out a
NOTEBOOK from a stack. She hands it to Otis.
DR. MORENO
I want you to write an account of
your memories so we can get you
started with imaginal exposure.
OTIS
What’s that?
DR. MORENO
It’s a simple way to stop avoiding
trauma reminders that get you
triggered.
OTIS
I avoid trauma reminders?? My whole
job is motivated by trauma
reminders. It’s a requirement.
DR. MORENO
We’re not talking about you using
trauma for your work. I’m talking
about triggers that make your
distress levels unmanageable and
result in violence.
Like what?

OTIS

8.
DR. MORENO
Whatever makes you angry is usually
a good place to start.
Beat.
DR. MORENO (CONT'D)
Otis, I have been doing this for a
long time... I saw your tests and
you have clear signs of P.T.S.D.
OTIS
No I don’t... From what??
We hold on his face and cut to title: HONEY BOY
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY - SOMETIME IN THE PAST
YOUNG OTIS LORT (12) peering into the camera.
He stares for a while. He’s once again laser focused and finetuned like an owl statue. He runs his tiny hand through his
bowl cut and looks to the lens with an adamant, striven for
smile when...
A WHIP CREAM PIE SMASHES into his face.
ON IMPACT - RAMP SPEED: His hardly anything body is ratcheted
out of focus into the air.
SLOW MOTION: Otis flying in the air until Normal Speed - He hangs in the air held by a wire. In front
of a white picket fence.
The form of a Stunt Coordinator arrives. He helps Otis down,
gives him a weary high five, and begins to walk him right
back to center to do it all over again.
2ND A.C. enters frame with the slate.
Frame up on the slate: 1995
TO BLACK.
INT/EXT. RALEIGH STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON
FADE IN: We’re over Otis's shoulder, walking stiffly in a
body harness out of a dark soundstage on the lot. He picks up
his Disc-Man that he left behind. Play.

9.
Adult figures surround him in silhouette.
Otis.

MAKE-UP LADY (O.C.)

She grabs him and quickly wipes his face from all the pie
left overs. He keeps walking.
Two people walk behind him carrying a beautiful sky matte
painting. They pass to reveal JAMES LORT (35), in-artfully wearing a BANDANA on his head to
cover his pronounced balding. He figures more hair is more
hair = thick sideburns. His vest tells you he is in the
Combat Vets MC, Desert Storm.
He pitches casually to the Crafty woman, PAM. A fairly
attractive, straight-laced woman circa his age. She’s got no
choice but to listen.
Otis arrives mid-conversation.
JAMES
I had a chicken named Henrietta
Lafowl.
PAM
Henrietta Lafowl?
JAMES
World’s first daredevil chicken.
OTIS
Dad, can you loosen the back part?
JAMES
One sec pal... So I’d come out, put
her on my head and do cartwheels.
Henrietta’d run from my head to my
butt, from my head to my butt...
Oh wow.

PAM

Otis tries to get out of his harness. No luck.
JAMES
Yes, ma'am. Spent a lot of time
with chickens... Rodeo. Lot of
time.
PAM
I can imagine.

10.
OTIS
Dad, I can’t...
James reluctantly starts unbuckling his son's harness while
continuing his story. Pam is watching them both.
JAMES
...Used to put her on my head, top
of my hat. I’d run an electrical
wire down my sleeve to her...
Couldn’t see it. I’d go and put a
K.F.C. bucket on the floor, light
the rim on fire for drama... and
when I’d hit that electrical
charge, Henrietta’d fly off’a my
head and land right there in the
center of that bucket. Hey-O!
Oh...

PAM

JAMES
Crowd ate it up. I once opened for
the Stevie Nicks at the Forum.....
James is not looking at what he is doing. Otis feels a PINCH.
OTIS
Oww... Fuck, Dad.
Pam reacts to the curse word. James tracks that. Gives Otis a
“Leave It To Beaver” disciplinary slap on the hand.
JAMES
Hey. What did we say about talking
like that?
They share a knowing look.
Otis doesn't wanna cock-block. He plays up his innocence. Dad
plays up his caring father. They perform together. What
better practice for a young actor.
OTIS
That we... That I’m not supposed to
talk like that.
JAMES
Apologize to Pam.
OTIS
I’m very sorry Pam.
Pam tries to be nice about it.

11.
PAM
That’s okay.
JAMES
Go hang up your wardrobe and thank
Donna for the day. You had a good
day otherwise.
OTIS
Yes, Daddy.
James is wearing his proud father face as he watches Otis
head off. He then pivots instantaneously to chasing pussy
again.
JAMES
So yea... Spent a lot time with
Chickens... In all that time you
know what I learned about
chickens... You know what’s that
white spot is in the center of
chicken poop?
Pam, whose never given as much of a shit about shit prior to
this, is trying to care.
PAM
What is it?
JAMES
That’s chicken poop also. Hey-o!
Got you.
James laughs shamelessly at his own joke. It’s the kind of
laughter that separates a clown from the crowd.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Hey you got a phone number?
Yeah...

PAM

JAMES
Can I get it from you?
He senses her hesitation.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Later? Maybe tomorrow?
Okay.

PAM

12.
JAMES
Have a good day.
He walks out.
EXT. RALEIGH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
James guns the bike. Otis jumps in the back. Crew members
hanging out while eying James.
Otis knows what they’re thinking. We stay behind.
EXT. BUSY BOULEVARD - SUNSET - CONTINUOUS
A Burgundy Honda Shadow 1200, flies down the junction outside
the parking lot, causing two cars to halt and nearly causing
an accident. Daily commuter at the helm is James. Bandanna on
his face now in a half shell helmet, cleaving lanes with
confidence.
His passenger Otis, in a Vespa helmet and a Jan-sport, tucks
his father’s hair into the back of his coat and hugs him from
behind.
In this town, you discern people best by how they maneuver
the road. James looks over his shoulder and gets between two
driving lanes cutting off everyone in sight. He turns left in
the junction and causes a car in the coming lane to halt.
Otis hand surfs the wind to flip the driver off.
CLOSE ON: Otis holding for dear life and enjoying the
closeness. This is the closest thing to a hug he knows.
Asshole. James downshifts, guns the yellow and expertly
slides into his parking spot at THE VISTA MOTEL: A parking
lot with twenty-five rooms and a swimming pool.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - POOL - EARLY EVENING
Otis jumps into the motel pool. He dips under then surfaces
and takes a moment to himself.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM
Otis sits by a little desk tucked in between the restroom
door and the window. He’s reviewing the next day’s lines.

13.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT
Across the parking lot a young prostitute is coming back from
a long night. Otis watches her. This is LITTLE Q, a queen in
a T-shirt. You’d guess thirties and be wrong. She’s barely
18. She’s not as beautiful so much as she is fascinating. The
whites of her eyes are neon white and soulful. She leans in
when you talk. That type.
Her pimp, MAMA DJ, pulls up. She gets out of her car and
walks over to her.
MAMA DJ
Who you been talking to? And I told
you not to wear that top didn’t I?
LITTLE Q
I didn’t have anything else
clean...
INT/EXT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOOM / DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS
James stands in the doorway with an unlit cigarette between
his lips while he watches over his bike.
He shouts out to another guest in a laundryroom we can’t see.
JAMES
Rocco! I’m in there!
(to Otis)
Hey give me the call sheet. Got the
per diem in there.
(to guest)
Don’t touch ‘em Rocco, those are my
socks!
Otis hands James a MANILLA ENVELOPE. James takes out the cash
inside and counts before yelling back across the lot.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You can’t give it ten more minutes?
James gives up and lights the cigarette.
JAMES (CONT'D)
They gotta get another washer and
dryer in this place man, it’s
turning into a nightmare.
Otis moves to the bathroom. Urinates with the door open.

14.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Oh no... oh no... hear that baby
trickle? You got one of them Lil
Jew rivulets. Oh shit, you can
thank your mother for that. You got
a dick like a golf pencil son.
OTIS
It’s enough to get the job done.
JAMES
What job are you going to get done?
Girls.

OTIS

Otis washes his hands; zips his fly and heads back to his
little desk.
JAMES
Girls? You couldn’t fuck yourself
with that thing Otis. You probably
got piss on your balls just now.
You got wet balls right now?
OTIS
(eye roll)
I'm twelve.
James steps toward the bathroom, takes a piss.
JAMES
When I was 12 my dick sounded just
like this.
Only a dribble comes out.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Wait for it...
(the stream picks up)
You hear that? You hear the depth
of that bowl? That’s roots buddy.
That’s blood. Where you come from.
Shit’s important but you don’t give
a fuck.
James exits without washing his hands. On his walk back to
the doorway he flicks Otis in the chest who is still reading
his script while keeping two fingers in his mouth.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What I just say?

15.
James, grabs another smoke and opens the front door, lights
his Kool and stares at his bike.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You hear me? What I just say? You
don’t listen that’s your problem...
and you’re selfish. I just told you
about your family and you’re over
there just staring at the thing? I
see you, you’re concentrating. I
know it takes a lot of
concentration to play a twelve-yearold. Have a pie fight. I get it...
OTIS
...It’s not a pie fight.
JAMES
Oh yeah? What do you got tomorrow?
I know what it is. It’s clowning,
poop-butt... with lines; It’s the
same thing as clowning. It’s rodeo.
It’s not.

OTIS

JAMES
It’s not what? The fuck would you
know... You never been to a rodeo.
OTIS
Yeah, I have.
JAMES
Don’t lie to me. When?... Who took
you to the rodeo?
Tom.

OTIS

That hits James. He looks back at his bike.
JAMES
Tom took you to the Rodeo? Of
course he did. Where did you go?
OTIS
I don’t know... it was a rodeo.
JAMES
See, you can’t remember. See there.
They have clowns at your rodeo? You
went to Pomona. That’s not even a
fucken rodeo. That’s a fair.
(MORE)

16.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You went to a fair. You come seen
me in Muskogee, boy. That’s THE
rodeo. I’m talkin bout lights.
Attractions. Animals. Face-paint.
Costumes. Commedia del'arte. I made
those bulls run til I broke every
bone in my cultured ass.
OTIS
It’s different... I’m not a clown.
JAMES
You bet your lil’ dick it’s
different... It’s all the same too.
Motherfucker...
(across the parking lot)
He in there? HEY! Rocco! Didn’t I
just say? Those are my socks!
(back to Otis)
Goddammit give me the call sheet
and get the bag. This motherfucker.
Otis takes a breath, puts his highlighter down and grabs the
manila envelope out of the trash. He reaches in and hands a
piece of paper to James.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
James and Otis walk towards the laundry room. James holding
the call sheet, Otis the laundry bag.
JAMES
(to Rocco)
Thank you. You’ll get it after.
OTIS
Hey, um, dad?
JAMES
Six A.M. you gotta go to sleep
early tonight.
OTIS
Yeah. About that. A.J has got me
tickets to the Dodger’s game.
JAMES
No shit? That is really cool.
OTIS
‘Cause Nomo’s pitching so he’s
going to take me to the game after
set tomorrow.

17.
JAMES
Who is pitching?
Nomo.

OTIS

JAMES
His name is Nomo?
OTIS
Yeah. Nomo the Tornado.
No shit.

JAMES

OTIS
I’m going to need some of that perdiem for a hot dog...
JAMES
Shit a name like that he could
probably strike em' out
blindfolded, this guy.
Probably.

OTIS

James reaches for his back pocket and hands Otis some cash.
JAMES
You know what they call a Japanese
blindfold don’t you?
Otis stops in the laundry room doorway and looks back.
JAMES (CONT'D)
They call it a shoelace.
James cracks up at his own joke.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Hey! Come on now, that shit was
funny you know it is.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - LAUNDRYROOM - CONTINUOUS
James follows Otis inside. He’s still laughing.
JAMES
I was getting ready to lean into
another one, you seen me coming
with it?
(MORE)

18.
JAMES (CONT'D)
I was going to hit em with that Sum
Ting Wong joke. You know that one?
You know it’s funny!
James jokingly pokes him.
Otis recoils and accidentally knocks James in the face. James
is pissed and takes off his glasses.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Hang on now buddy, you gonna break
my shit.
OTIS
I didn’t mean to...
JAMES
Load the fucking bag up. Watch
where your hands are going, man.
They start to take laundry out of the dryer.
JAMES (CONT'D)
So you’re going to this game with
AJ?
Yeah.

OTIS

JAMES
Who is driving you?
A.J....

OTIS

James puts his hands up on a laundry-cart in the center of
the room. He isn’t playing at all anymore.
JAMES
No, no, no. You’re going to the
game with A.J. but who is driving?
Cause he’s fourteen years old and
his parents are in Castaic, so who
is driving you to the game?
A long beat.
From the other side, Otis puts his hands on the laundry-cart
too, so they are now face to face.
Tom.

OTIS

19.
JAMES
Tom’s driving you? That’s all you
got to say to me?
OTIS
I’m sorry dad.
For what?

JAMES

Otis let’s go of the laundry-cart.
OTIS
For lying to you. I just thought
you’d get weird, ya know?
Otis starts putting clothes in the laundry bag.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT
They walk back to their room in silence.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM
They enter the room and James immediately shuts the door.
JAMES
Pull out five socks.
Five?

OTIS

JAMES
Yeah. You do two. You drop it you
do ten pushups.
Otis hands his dad three pairs of rolled up socks and keeps
two for himself. They start juggling. Throwing the socks up
in the air to themselves and to each other.
OTIS
Hey dad? Remember how you said you
were going to build me a treehouse?
JAMES
We never owned a tree, son. Buy me
a tree and I'll get to work.
Otis drops a pair of socks.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What was that?

20.

I’m sorry.

OTIS

JAMES
Pick it up.
He does as told and they start juggling again.
OTIS
You go to your meeting?
Yeah...

JAMES

OTIS
Was it good?
Yeah.

JAMES

James drops a pair of socks and picks it up.
Missed it!

OTIS

JAMES
We’re even.
(back to the conversation)
Yeah... Ray’s got 45 years in a
row... big cakes.
Woah.

OTIS

JAMES
I’m coming up on four myself, you
know that right?
OTIS
That’s crazy.
Otis drops a sock.
JAMES
Alright go ahead.
Ten?
Yup. Ten.

OTIS
JAMES

Otis starts doing push-ups.

21.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You gonna give me a cake?
OTIS
(mid push-ups)
Yeah if you want one.
JAMES
You know what else I want?
What?

OTIS

JAMES
To meet your buddy Tom and make
sure he’s not a chicken-hawk.
Otis stops doing push-ups and gets up.
He’s not.

OTIS

JAMES
I want to make sure he’s not.
OTIS
You need to trust me.
JAMES
No you need to trust me! I don’t
know why I don’t get to meet him.
OTIS
Mom thinks you’ll get weird.
JAMES
Your mother thinks a lot of things
that aren’t true. Your mother lives
in fuckin’ space.
OTIS
She’s always been there for me.
JAMES
Yeah she’s been there for you and
she’s been at the Renaissance Fair.
I’ve been there for you too. I’m
the one that gets you up at four in
the morning. Who’s the one here
now?
OTIS
She’s busy! She has a job.

22.
JAMES
Why is she busy? Why does she have
a job? Think it through. Play the
tape out.
Otis sits down on the bed.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What does your mother have a job
for?
OTIS
Just in case.
JAMES
In case what?
OTIS
I don’t know!
JAMES
In case you fail.
James drops down to eye level with Otis.
JAMES (CONT'D)
In case it don’t work out.
No.

OTIS

JAMES
Yes man. She’s filling your head
full of fear. I would never do that
to you. I pump you full of
strength! Because we’re a team and
I know you got what it takes.
You’re a fucking star and I know
it. That’s why I’m here. I’m your
cheerleader, honey boy. You trust
me?
Yeah.

OTIS

JAMES
Okay then! I’ll make you a horse
trade. I’ll give you this pack of
cigarettes-OTIS
The whole pack?

23.
JAMES
The whole pack... if you bring him
in here. You gotta smoke them in
the bathroom though cause I don’t
want people to think I’m a shit
father.
OTIS
No one thinks you’re a shit father.
JAMES
No one thinks I’m a shit father?
You’re mother thinks I’m a shit
father.
OTIS
That’s in your head.
JAMES
Tom thinks I’m a shit father.
OTIS
That’s also in your head.
JAMES
How do you think you get in the big
brother program? Huh? What’s the
main reason?
OTIS
There is no main reason.
JAMES
Yeah there is a main reason. You
gotta have a shit father.
No...

OTIS

JAMES
Yes you do. And your mother is
advertising what a shit father I am
every time you go to these fuckin’
Dodger games or paint ball or dirt
bike or whatever it is you’re
doing. And look, I got four years
sober son... four years is REAL.
You bring him over here and how
about this, I’ll barbecue for him?
Otis isn’t sure.

24.
JAMES (CONT'D)
It’s just a start... just planting
seeds ya’ know? Come on man. You
gotta let me in a little bit!
OTIS
Just a barbecue?
Yeah...

JAMES

He hands Otis the pack of cigarettes.
OTIS
Okay.
(smiling)
I’ll ask but it doesn’t mean he’s
going to come.
James holds Otis’s face in celebration.
JAMES
Thank you! That’s all I’m asking
you to do!
James gets up, mission accomplished...
JAMES (CONT'D)
You want a soda?
Yeah.

OTIS

And heads out of the room.
Otis stays on the bed looking over the cigarette in his hand.
He looks for a lighter but can’t find one. He puts the
cigarette behind his ear and starts folding the forgotten
laundry on the bed.
CLOSE ON: Otis’s face staring into the lens, the glow of the
motel T.V flickering off his face.
ON THE SCREEN: James, in clown face, in a desert. He’s
looking into the camera while performing with his chicken on
top of his hat.
JAMES
(on TV)
And now, ladies and gentleman, boys
and girls, performing live,
Henrietta Lafowl, world’s first
daredevil chicken.

25.
With the chicken still on his head, James turns away from the
camera to face the desert.
He does a headstand while Henrietta climbs his back to stop
and stand on his butt.
James, now standing on his head, with his chicken resting on
his butt, looks directly into the camera.
JAMES (CONT'D)
(on TV)
Henrietta Lafowl! World’s first
daredevil chicken!

Otis cranks up the speed.
EXT. REHAB - POOL - AFTERNOON
Soft music playing.
A group of twelve clients floating in the pool. Some are
being held by others.
Otis watches from the sides.
ALEC (30s), caucasian Anger Management Coach, gives his
“Anger management coach exercises” to the group while eyeing
Otis. We get the sense Alec’s calm exterior seems to hide a
suppressed interior.
ALEC
Can I get everyone’s attention
please. We’re going to do a small
trust exercise, okay?
(MORE)

26.
ALEC (CONT'D)
You’re just going to grab your

In front of him knitting needles and a ball.

forth.

What is this? What are you trying
to do? You can’t have me in the
fucking room knitting for two
hours!
DR. MORENO
What are your SUDS right now?
70!

OTIS

DR. MORENO
Okay let’s bring it down. I want

moment-We watch Otis’s eyes pick four things.

Snap the rubber-band with each

Otis contains his frustration. But it shows.
Door.

OTIS

He slaps the door.
DR. MORENO
Let’s try again. Name four things
and let them bring you back into
the room.
He can’t look at her again when he talks.
No.

OTIS

He continues to pace the room upset.
EXT. REHAB - CHICKEN COOP - DAY
Otis and Percy retrieve eggs and place them in construction
buckets.
PERRY
You know chickens outnumber humans

That’s a true fact. You can look it
up.
They get back to work.

Why?

PERCY

He takes another bite.
OTIS
I’m fucking with you. I don’t.
He goes to brush his teeth.
INT. REHAB - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
He closes the door and stares at himself in the mirror as he
starts to pee.
He watches himself as he listens to the sound of his urine.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM - MORNING - 1995
Otis wakes up but stays in bed for a second to stare at the
ceiling.
He gets up and packs a few things. He waits for the coffee
maker with the shades drawn. Light creeping in through the
slit. He pops a CD in his walkman and looks at the dust specs
in the light.
He sees James sleeping in his bed.
Otis places a hot cup of coffee by his glasses and a small
wrapped up gift.
He rubs his hand across his dad’s bare-feet to stir him awake
and then grabs his backpack and goes.
Door closes.
James’s eyes open. He grabs the gift and opens it. It’s a
Scratch N’ Sniff watch. He scratches. And Sniffs.

James sits by the door with his coffee and works on bending
two Paper Clips into a lock opener.

riverbank’s gate behind the Free-Way.
James lays his bike up and opens his side-saddle. He pulls
out a bright “Adopt-A-Highway” safety vest, hard hat, gloves,
a pick-up stick, goggles and a white trash bag. He walks up
and over to the bank of the freeway and lowers to a knee.
CUT TO:
INT. AA MEETUP - EVENING
Chandler Lodge’s Moto-Meeting Stag. Eighteen men in chairs
sit in a circle under an awning smoking cigarettes.
A few who are not club related. Lawyers, a few Dads, an old
Veteran, two twenty-something's from a band, all encircling a
Folger's can by the twelve or so motorcycles in the back.
CRAIG (late 40s), looks like a man who has been scraping the
bottom longer than the top, is in the midst of a share...
James watches him like a hawk.
CRAIG
I guess I’m here because of my old
man... He was a preacher. A
bullshitter basically. A liar. A
thief. But mainly he was never
there for me. He was doing his own
thing. And I thought wow, good,
well cool for him. But what about
me?
CUT TO:

30.
INT. TRAILER - DAY
Otis sits alone in his trailer in pajamas. He opens the door
and looks but no one is there. He heads back inside and sits
down and lights up a cigarette.
BACK TO:
INT. AA MEETUP - EVENING
Craig continues his share.
CRAIG
Nobody was there so I thought I’ll
drink it out. Getting shit-faced
worked... ya know? It worked like a
charm. Took away the “cut and
dried” feeling... For a bit.
CUT TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY - RIVERBANK
James kneels down and digs into the soil.
BACK TO:
INT. AA MEETUP - EVENING
James adjusts his posture to look taller than Craig. Like
little kids do when they take pictures together.
CRAIG
So I ran with that because what
else was offered. Church? God?
Yes... But that didn’t quite work
for me... It’s bullshit really.
CUT TO:
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - EARLY EVENING.
Otis, still alone, looking to see if his ride is coming...
BACK TO:
INT. AA MEETUP - CONTINUOUS
Craig still sharing. James still watching him.

31.
CRAIG
I thought if God was real, he built
me with a question that only I can
answer. And that’s what you have to
do. You have to answer that
question yourself. You have to do
it yourself. You’ve gotta
ultimately save yourself.
James gets uncomfortable and looks around to see if anyone
else is hearing this... He checks Craig.
JAMES
I’m sorry, what book were you
reading?
CRAIG
I know what the book says but what
I am saying is what’s honest with
me-JAMES
It says we came to believe,
partner. Why don’t you read the
fucking book again? I can’t do it
anymore, man.
He stands and leaves while shouting over his shoulder.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You guys are gonna keep signing up
for this shit why don’t you just
sign up for the Kool-Aid committee
cause all you fuckers are drinking
it.
James leaves the meeting still yelling.
JAMES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Why don’t you write your own
fucking book, huh?
CRAIG
You’re not alone brother!
JAMES (O.S.)
Shut the fuck up. I needed a
fucking meeting today!
And they let him go.

PA
You sure? I didn’t see him on set
today.
OTIS
Yeah he was here... yep.
PA
Well good work today. Take it easy.
OTIS
Thank you. See ya!
She drives away. Otis waits til she is out of sight and then
starts to walk home.
CUT TO:
EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - NIGHT
James and Otis walk holding hands.
As they approach a TACO TRUCK and its line of customers,
James recoils and lets go.
Now at the truck, Otis hands him some money.
OTIS
I’ll get chicken tacos. Two please.
James approaches the window.
JAMES
I’ll get four chicken tacos. You
got Horchata up there?
A girl sees Otis and whispers to her friend. They turn and
stare. James clocks it.

33.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Holy shit. They recognize you.
Sometimes I wish I was you, man.
You do?

OTIS

JAMES
Course.... Be famous, people
chasing me with cameras and shit,
Women... Not these junk whores...

OTIS
What’s a good one?
JAMES
Dolly Parton type. Woman with a
strategy.
Otis actually laughs now.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What’s funny bout that Otis? Dolly
Parton’s got her shit together. You

James grabs their food and hands Otis his tray.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You ain’t got a fucking theme park.

James is sitting outside. Smoking. Alone.
Little Q is back from another long night.
She puts her bag inside the room and sits outside to smoke a
cigarette.
James gets up and walks past the grassy area between their
rooms.
He starts to perform a small clowning/Mime routine for her.
She watches for a while and smiles at him.
He finishes and bows to her.

34.
When he looks up she’s gone into the room.
INT/EXT. TOM’S CAR / VISTA MOTEL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
A beautiful yellow HOT ROD TRUCK pulls into the driveway with
Otis in the passenger seat.
He’s in a Dodger hat, holding a signed ball by Nomo.
Driver is TOM (35), A strong chinned Hispanic man dressed
casually in a leather jacket.
OTIS
So uh... he doesn’t really like the
Big Brothers program so just don’t
bring it up and stuff if that’s
okay.
Oh okay.

TOM

Tom apprehensively waves to James who is outside watching
them park.
JAMES
Wow. Nice car.
TOM
Hey thanks. I’m Tom.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT
They shake as Otis gets out and runs off to the room with his
bag.
JAMES
I’m his father.
TOM
Nice to meet you.
JAMES
Beautiful truck. You do the work on
her?
Sure did.

TOM

JAMES
Pop it! Go ahead.
Tom pops the hood.

35.

292 huh?

JAMES (CONT'D)

TOM
This is actually the 352. 5.8
Liter.
JAMES
Right. Y-blocks, that’s the 292...
TOM
Y-block 292 to 272, that was the
big engine in the T-bird.
JAMES
That’s right, yeah.
TOM
Then they upgraded in ‘65 to the
352 cubic.
JAMES
Fuckin’ pretty man.
TOM
Thank you brother.
JAMES
Sits low four a 4x4 isn’t it?
TOM
It’s the original coil springs on

Well all 64 trucks had leaf springs

They follow Otis to the pool. Talking as they walk.

you?
TOM
It’s the old man’s last name. Henry
Ford.
No sir.

JAMES

TOM
What’s it stand for?
JAMES
Found on the road dead.
James laughs. Tom is polite. Otis keeps walking ahead.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - POOL - CONTINUOUS
Otis gets in the water. We stay with him watching them
nervously as they get to know each other.
JAMES
So you working for the FBI or
something?
TOM
No nothing like that, that’s a
little out of my pay-grade. I’m a
passport specialist.
JAMES
Oh what’s that? State Department?
What the fuck you doin’ over there?
TOM
I majored in telecommunications,
I’m half Mexican... so I’ve got a
vested interested in fighting
discrimination here in the city...

37.
JAMES
That’s fantastic.
(to Otis)
Hey go get some soda and the
ketchup!
Otis hops out of the water. James tosses him the keys to
their room.
JAMES (CONT'D)
So you’re saying you’re an
idealist? Yeah, man. That’s cool, I
know a little bit about that. Like,
uh, ‘I don’t know where I’m going
but I’m on my way there!' Am I
right?
Yeah...

TOM

Tom sits.
JAMES
Alright, take a seat man, we got a
little time.
James sits down next to him.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Woo, sun in your eyes?
No...

TOM

JAMES
Well it’s good having you here.
TOM
I appreciate it man. I’ve heard all
about ya.
JAMES
So what’s your story Tom?
TOM
I’m from Detroit. I still have both
my parents... twin sister...
Graduated from Calvin in Grand
Rapids...

38.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT
Otis runs out across the lot to the soda machine. We go with
him. He passes the Vista maid doing the rounds.
INT. VISTA MOTEL - LAUNDRYROOM - CONTINUOUS
Otis arrives. Little Q and Mama DJ are in a tense argument
nearby. Little Q’s shoulder is bruised.
He listens in while pretending to look for his money.
MAMA DJ
Get outta my face!
Mama DJ leaves.
Otis starts to put quarters in the soda machine. Once Mama DJ
is gone, Little Q unearths a pack of cigarettes hidden under
the soda machine.
Beat.
OTIS
I like your Jellies.
Jellies?

LITTLE Q

Otis points at her shoes.
LITTLE Q (CONT'D)
Oh. Thanks.
Like a business man, Otis puts his hand out for a handshake.
OTIS
I’m Otis. I live over there in
number 6.
He’s twelve. It’s strange.
She grabs it and begins to THUMB WRESTLE. She wins. She keeps
his thumb under hers for a little longer.
He’s uncomfortable.
She smiles and lets go. She takes out a cigarette but sees
it’s broke down the center. Otis, soda now in hand, notices.
OTIS (CONT'D)
Hey! Wait right here...
BACK TO:

39.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL POOL
James is manning the grill.
JAMES
So Calvin is a big school. I know
that. They got a basketball
program. That’s an expensive school
isn’t it?
TOM
I had a little help.
JAMES
Got to! How the fuck you swing that
man? Shit, Mexican, come from
poverty. Gotta be hard as fuck to
get in there.
TOM
Lot of hard work...
JAMES
You get some kinda Spanish grant or
something?
Otis approaches and listens in for the right moment to
disturb.
OTIS
(to Tom)
Hey, are you good?
TOM
I’m good Otis thanks.
OTIS
(to James)
Dad can I bum a smoke?
James hands him one.
Thank you.

OTIS (CONT'D)

JAMES
Hang on to your butts.
Tom knows he can’t interject but “what the fuck”. Otis runs
off. We stay with James and Tom as he re-composes.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Love that kid.

40.
TOM
He’s a great kid...
Yessir.

JAMES

TOM
I think that’s why the Big Brother
program is so important. To have
more voices to listen to.
JAMES
Sure I’ll bet.
James plops a plate of burgers on the table and sits down.
JAMES (CONT'D)
So this father figure-TOM
I had a strong voice and now I have
a chance to pay it forward. Help
out when I can.
James leans forward to look Tom in the eyes.
JAMES
That’s good on you. I appreciate
you Tom. I know my son appreciates
you also. He likes you. I can see
it on his face.
James goes to light a cigarette then stops.
JAMES (CONT'D)
I bet if you went over there right
now and asked that boy who he wants
to be when he grows up, he
wouldn’t say me.
No?

TOM

James lights the smoke.
TOM (CONT'D)
Why’s that?
JAMES
I don’t know. Would he say you,
Tom?
James stares into his soul.

41.
TOM
It’s not about that for me James...
JAMES
What’s it about for you?
TOM
Giving back. Letting somebody know
you are there for them. Being of
service.
JAMES
No I know about that cause I do a
little bit of service myself. I got
about four years sober.
TOM
That’s good.
James laughs.
JAMES
Is it good?
TOM
It’s great.
JAMES
It is great isn’t it.
TOM
I’ve seen a lot of lives get
ruined...
JAMES
It’s tough.
TOM
I can only imagine.
JAMES
One day at a time man... Look I
don’t know what you’ve heard about
me Tom, but I know what you haven’t
heard about me. What you haven’t
heard about me is that if I catch
you around my son again, in any
capacity whatsoever, I will skull
fuck your well-adjusted twin
sister’s carcass on top of your
casket until my dick runs through
the back of her half-Mexican brain
plate. You hear what the fuck I’m
saying?

42.
Tom gets up to walkaway. James shoots up.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You going to take that jacket off
cause it’s hot as shit?
James starts fiddling to get Tom’s coat off him. Tom resists.
It gets messy. A NEAR BRAWL ENSUES and James THROWS TOM INTO
THE POOL.
JAMES (CONT'D)
GET YOUR OWN FUCKING KID! AND YOUR
OWN FUCKING SANDWICH MOTHERFUCKER!
Otis rushes back over just in time to see James throw the
buns at Tom in the pool.

Everyone forms a circle and hugs themselves.
Alec holds himself as he speaks to the group in a hushed
tone.
ALEC (CONT'D)
Otis will you please join us?
He does.
ALEC (CONT'D)
We all know what to do in the hug
circle right? This is a feeling you
can have anywhere you are. You can
always come back here. To this
pool, to this circle, to this
feeling...
(MORE)

43.
ALEC (CONT'D)
Hugging yourself releases the
cuddle hormone. Can you feel that?
The group sorta feels it.
ALEC (CONT'D)
That’s a tool we can use wherever
we are.
Otis is not having it.
OTIS
You can’t do this everywhere.
ALEC
You can actually...
OTIS
You can’t do this in a car on the
freeway or in court.
ALEC
Well maybe if you used this tool
you wouldn’t end up in court.
OTIS
Isn’t hugging yourself like
tickling yourself? Like you can’t
tickle yourself?
Percy shakes his head.
PERCY
My shit feels good. I’m releasing
all them hormones!
ALEC
Percy you might be too good at
this.
PERCY
It’s my fourth time in rehab... and
I tried this in court, that’s how I

Otis laughs.
OTIS
I don’t know. I just know I’m stuck
here... Life is in session and
these people are wasting my fucking
time.
PERCY
What do you know about time?
Otis looks at him.
PERCY (CONT'D)
My cousin got 8 years inside and
they got a nigga here knitting a
mother fucking scarf... Listening
to you bitching about time. Look at
this place? If my cousin saw me he
would beat my mother fuckin ass...

45.
OTIS
You should send him the scarf.
Otis cracks up at his joke.
PERCY
What am I going to say? Stay warm

They laugh.

OTIS (CONT'D)
You need to get your

Oh, uh...I think so.
OTIS (CONT'D)
(on phone)
I think he, uh, I think he can go.
Hang on, let me ask.
(to James)
She wants to know if you can leave

James sits silently and stares at Otis holding the phone.
JAMES
Why does she ask you that?

47.
Otis puts the phone to his ear and listens.
OTIS
(to James)
Well she said, “because of your
record.”
James stands up abruptly, leans into Otis and SHOUTS into the
phone.
JAMES
I know because of “my record!” I
know because of “my record!” I’m
asking why you’re asking a twelve
year old, woman!
James begins frantically pacing around the room.
JAMES (CONT'D)
OTIS
Fuck me, man. You know, you

I’ll ask.
(to James)
Do you want to talk to her?

okay...She said, “she can ask Tom
to deal with the passports” -JAMES
Oh fucking fantastic! Great!
Fantastic. Oh, Tom’s gonna do it?!

phone!
James continues looking for something.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Dammit, where’s my lighter at?
(to himself)
Oh wow, you just want to keep
pushing my fucking buttons, girl.
Otis patiently listens to his mom on the phone.
OTIS
(on phone)
Okay, and just repeat it?...Okay, I
can try...
Otis then parrots what his parents say as if he were them. As
if he were playing them to each-other.
A young actor prepares.
OTIS (CONT'D)
(to James as the mom)
“I have long ago forgiven you,
James.”...
JAMES
Who you talking to?
OTIS
(to James as the mom)
“But I’m not the one who had to
jump out of a moving car so you
didn’t rape me!”
JAMES
Here we go. Here we go with this
fucking victim shit!
OTIS
(on phone as James)
“Here we go with this fucking
victim shit.”

JAMES (CONT'D)
She does this every time she
calls up here.

JAMES (CONT'D)
She goes on and on every time she

OTIS

“Every fucking time!”...

“You were the biggest love of my
life”...

JAMES
Well then treat me better, bitch!!
OTIS
(to James as the mom)
“Do you know what I went
through?”...
James erupts and starts yelling toward Otis again. Otis holds
up the phone so James can shout directly into it.
JAMES
What who went through?!! They put
me in a fucking box!! I didn’t even
-- what is the point of calling up
here?!! FUCK!!
Otis puts the phone back to his ear, listens to his mom’s
response.
OTIS
(to James as the mom)
“I was always there for you”-James YANKS the phone from Otis’s hand.
JAMES
Go outside!
Otis gets up from the bed and walks outside.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
We stay with Otis, outside of their room. Watching James
scream into the phone inside.
JAMES
(on phone)
You know what the fuck I do?!! I
put my fucking ass on the line
every fucking day!! For this boy!
For this boy!!
Otis paces back and forth not knowing what to do or where to
go. He grabs a stick heads toward a debased car junk yard in
the back of the hotel.
EXT. VACANT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Otis walks amongst old rusty broken down cars.

50.
He picks up a brick from the ground. He looks at it. Feels
the weight of it in his hand. He THROWS THE BRICK through a
car’s front windshield.
Glass everywhere.
Otis rests on the hood of the car he just shattered.
He takes out his pack of Kool’s. He smells the cigarettes
then takes one out and lights it.
EXT/INT. AA MEETUP - ALANO CLUB - NIGHT
James locks his helmet down and walks up the stairs of the
Alano club. We go up the stairs with him, hovering over
shoulder as he greets the card players in the front room.
They’re happy to see him. It’s his day.
James knows everyone. CARLOS, a Hispanic man with long curly
hair, holds the Blue Book and a laminated “Traditions” page.
He’s immediately avuncular.
As James greets the group we hear his share.
JAMES (V.O.)
How you doing, I’m James. I’m a
double winner.
Hi James.

AA GROUP (V.O.)

JAMES (V.O.)
My sobriety date was June 4th,
1988. Carlos is my sponsor.
Moorpark is my home group. Thank
you for bringing me in here.
CUT TO:
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - POOL - NIGHT
Otis spots Little Q sitting by herself. He walks over and
notices she is looking at a SNAKE gliding on the water like
Jesus.
James’s share carries us over the action.
JAMES (V.O.)
Jocelyn Joy Ginger... My mother.
She wrote a lot of songs. A lot of
poems.
(MORE)

51.
JAMES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She ended up as an alcoholic
working in Shreveport, Lucky
Luciano’s gambling Casino and whore
house... And that’s where she met
my Pop who was an alcoholic too.
They were the only ones left in the
bar... Sometimes love is like
that...
CLOSE ON: The snake as he moves.
OTIS
The fuck is that?
Otis sits next to her.
LITTLE Q
You can walk on water until someone
tells you that you don’t know how.
Beat.
LITTLE Q (CONT'D)
Do you understand?
They both remain fixated on the snake.
Yeah.

OTIS

LITTLE Q
Hey, are you cold? Come here.
Otis falls into her. She holds him. He smiles.
BACK TO:
INT. AA MEETUP - ALANO CLUB
James still in the middle of his share. His eyes closed.
Everything from memory.
JAMES
I was 11 when my Mom told me that
she would rather be with women and
particularly this woman who was a
mean ass woman and an outrageous
alcoholic. She’d beat you over the
head til she broke her hand and
just keep laying in on you. Just
did not give a shit and would do it
again the next day. Always remember
her hand in a cast...

52.
He opens his eyes and looks up.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Drama... It was always drama. My
mom ended up falling out of a
window and landed on a freeway...
Major fucking drama. After she died
I had booze and weed. You know... I
grieved her... then I joined the
army to find some structure cause
what else? Then I came home and I
spun out. I did so much fucking
cocaine I can’t breathe out my nose
no more. I started shooting in my
arm. Just didn’t give a shit no
more. Drinking everyday straight.
Weeks. Fell into a blackout.
(a long, tough, beat)
Woke up a sex offender. They told
me I didn’t rape this woman but I
did enough to get her to jump out
of a moving car... That’s where my
disease took me... and they took me
up to Tehachapi and I stayed there
for three years and nine months...
Lost a lot... Found the program in
jail. Found God in the program.
Found page 429 says those actions
that once made you feel completely
ashamed and totally discouraged
will allow you to share with other
people how to be a useful human
being. By the gratitude of God I
realized I had a son I had to
raise. A boy. My boy... Otis.
CUT TO:
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Otis looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.
He looks directly into his own eyes. No shame. Not yet. He
feels good about himself and exits the bathroom into the main
room.
A pillow flies at him from his father’s bed. We find Little
Q.
BACK TO:

53.
INT. AA MEETUP - ALANO CLUB
James looks down, starting to cry.
JAMES
I’m trying my best. For that kid.
But I’m in pain like a motherfucker
man.
CUT TO:
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Otis timidly walks towards Little Q.
She reaches out her hands. He rests his on top of hers... She
turns hers over quickly to try to slap his. They laugh and
play. Innocent but flirty.
She looks at him. She leans in closer and softly kisses his
cheek. She closes her eyes. He kisses her eyelid. She opens
her eyes and runs her hand down his face.
Feeling emboldened he takes off his shirt. They lay in bed.
Otis finds a way under her arm. Little Q holds him like a
mother. Gives him warmth. Otis nuzzles like a tomcat.
He has an idea. He gets up and pulls out money from the
nightstand.
He gets back in bed and looks her in the eyes. He rubs her
face like she rubbed his. He takes her hand and places the
money inside.
He gets up and leaves. We don’t know where to.
She looks down at the money...

EXT. REHAB - WOODS - DAY - 2005
Otis is alone in the woods.
He walks for awhile and takes a deep breath. He grabs a
walking stick.

Otis walks through the rusty cars and finds a stick. He rubs
the hood of a car.

FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS - 1995
He stands on top of a car. He looks up at the sky.
He raises his arms and YELLS. It’s high pitched and hopeful.
From his yell we
MATCH CUT TO:
EXT. REHAB - WOODS - 2005
Where Otis lifts his head and SCREAMS as loud and as long as
he physically can. Until he is shaking and we hear a small
shrill sound...
Into rationalization and hysterical piss yourself manic
laughter.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. HALF BANGER TRAILER - MORNING - 1995
There are GLITTERY silver party streamers tacked up as
decoration over the entrance of Otis’s trailer.
James and Otis are playing gin and drinking coffee. The T.V.
is on T.B.S. Set-life whirlwinds in the B.G.
JAMES
You're sandbagging... Do what you
do, but Ima’ catch you with them
face cards in your hand.
OTIS
If I had something, I’d put it
down.

55.
JAMES
I know what you have. You’ve got a
mirror behind you smart-ass.
James pulls his discard off the top.
JAMES (CONT'D)
I like those nines too so keep
those coming.... Please?
No can do.

OTIS

Otis lays down all his cards.
OTIS (CONT'D)
Gin... Fifty, plus whatever you got
in your hand.
Otis grabs the pencil and the paper.
JAMES
Your... Fuck-n-hell... Twenty,
twenty-five, thirty-five, thirtysix...
OTIS
Eighty-six...
He writes it down. James stands to use the toilette.
JAMES
I fucking knew it, too. I saw it on
your face!
Otis is smiling.
OTIS
I’m getting better... Learning to
lie.
JAMES
You lie for a living, poop-butt.
We all do.
I don’t.

OTIS
JAMES

James comes back, Otis is shuffling.
OTIS
Yeah, you do.

56.
JAMES
I’m a lot of things honey boy. A
liar isn’t one of em’.
You lie.

OTIS

JAMES
Never in my life.
OTIS
Why won’t you hold my hand?
James lights a cigarette. Exhales out the door.
JAMES
I don’t want people thinking I’m a
chicken-hawk... Deal the cards. I’m
going to get a soda.
CUT TO:
INT. REHAB - ALEC’S OFFICE - 2005
Otis walks in and goes right to shake his hand.
OTIS
Hey. I wanted to thank you. That
was really amazing. I felt like a
demon moved out. That was powerful.
ALEC
Are you acting right now?
OTIS
We all are. All the time.
ALEC
Ok... Are you being sincere right
now? Or are you mocking me?
Both.

OTIS

Beat.
ALEC
I’m not going anywhere.
Good.

OTIS

57.
ALEC
You’re not gonna wear me out Otis.
OTIS
...I’m not trying.
Beat.
ALEC
...This is not me judging you.
OTIS
What is it then?
ALEC
Me telling you that I’ll see you in
class.
Otis leaves and SLAMS the door after him.
The Coach comes out after him.
ALEC (CONT'D)
Otis, do you know how to close a
door gently?
Of course.
How?

OTIS
ALEC

OTIS
You pull with one hand and push
with the other.
Alec smiles.
Good.

ALEC

Otis nods and walks away.
INT. REHAB - DR. MORENO OFFICE - LATER
On the table is a notebook labeled DAD. Otis is pacing.
DR. MORENO
It’s ok to be frustrated.
He still can’t look at her when he talks.

58.
OTIS
I just... I don’t need to talk
about my fucking father. My dad’s
not the reason I drink... He’s the
reason I work! He just takes credit
for everything in my life that is
good. My dad is the kind of guy
that takes credit for other
people’s ideas... Even his AA
shares are an amalgamation of other
AA shares...
Beat.
Dr. Moreno stays quiet for a while until he looks at her.
DR. MORENO
So having your OWN ideas is key?
Otis’s face.
DR. MORENO (CONT'D)
Start writing Otis.
Without even realizing it he hugs himself as he thinks it
over...
EXT. REHAB -

NEAR CHICKEN COOP / TENNIS COURT - DUSK

Otis walks from the treatment facility across the campus to
the housing unit as the sun drops.
He sees a SINGLE CHICKEN wandering around.
He looks at it. Doing its thing. Free.
He bends down and picks up a piece of chicken poop and
examines it.
OTIS
(sotto)
You know what the white spot is?
It’s more chicken shit.
The chicken is on the move. He discards the poop and follows.
EXT. SURREAL TRAILER PARK ENTRANCE - EVENING
Otis enters a weirdly familiar trailer park that is setup in
the same layout as the Vista Motel.

59.
He keeps following the chicken until he sees a MOTORCYCLE. He
touches it.
He sees a trailer he recognizes. He enters it.
INT. SURREAL TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
Otis enters the trailer and starts to hear an old recording.
YOUNG OTIS (V.O.)
Give me a cigarette, Dad.
JAMES (V.O.)
Not until you get this scene.
You're gonna make me laugh or were
gonna do this all fucking night.
YOUNG OTIS (V.O.)
You know I’m doing you a favor...
by paying you to be my chaperon.
Give me a fucking cigarette, Dad.
JAMES (V.O.)
Whoa. You're doing who a favor?
YOUNG OTIS (V.O.)
You... Who else is gonna give a
felon a job? I’m not stupid.
Otis picks up a radio and the reception scrambles. He tries
to fix it until something outside catches his eye.
EXT. SURREAL TRAILER PARK - CONTINUOUS
Otis walks towards an OLD MAN IN A CHAIR. As he walks he
still hears the recording but now it’s 2005 Otis and James.
JAMES (V.O.)
You been fucking your life up.
OTIS (V.O.)
Yeah what’d you hear?
JAMES (V.O.)
I thought they were going to put
you away for real this time.
OTIS (V.O.)
That wasn’t me.

60.
JAMES (V.O.)
Oh it wasn’t you? Who was that
then?
OTIS (V.O.)
It was you. It’s magic. Every
single time I drink you takeover.
JAMES (V.O.)
Oh yeah? I takeover? Your dick get
bigger too pecker-wood?

He reaches for the rubber-band on his wrist. Snap.
He tries to go back to sleep. He can’t.
EXT. REHAB - TENIS COURT - DAY
Otis is writing in his notebook.
On the ground is a sample of clean urine and his knitting.
It’s a beginning of a scarf.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
A family house interior. Unreasonable strong wind is blowing.
Otis is in hair rollers, lipstick and a nightgown. He is
performing a Karate sequence and mouthing the sound FX to his
sister... His Grandma is sitting next to him.
James sporting a left-eye shiner, a cut on his eyebrow and a
swollen lip. He watches Otis from off-camera with a touch of
envy mixed with pride. Repeating lines that he's helped his
son rehearse.
OTIS
Rain drops! What’s up now dog? I’m
the funny one around here... I can
probably kick Grandma’s butt!
He looks at his Scratch and Sniff watch, checks the clock on
the wall... And walks over to the camera man. With one
confident movement he shuts down the camera in the middle of
the take.
The whole set is up in arms.
JAMES
I don’t care. I’ll be the bad guy.
That’s it! Good take, good take.
(now clapping)
You did it. Good job everybody.
Let’s go. That’s it. It’s going to
take another twenty minutes to get

James sits on a bed rehearsing lines with Otis who is pacing.
JAMES
It says here you are part of that
sight gag. That’s your opportunity.
Workout faces are funny. Your
workout faces are your
opportunity... Flare your nostrils
when you breath! Show me!
James flares his nostrils.
OTIS
That’s not funny though.
JAMES
What’s not funny?
OTIS
When you flare your nostrils.
JAMES
I like it a lot. I think it’s very
funny.

63.
OTIS
Okay. Fine.
JAMES
Just try it.
Let’s go.

OTIS

Otis drops to do push-ups.
JAMES
You’re going to start on the floor
when I told you it’s a sight gag?
OTIS
I told you, It’s just for heart
rate.
JAMES
I told you it’s a sight gag how am
I supposed to see your face?
OTIS
I don’t need to do it in the scene.
It’s not going to happen in the
scene.
JAMES
No one cares about the fucking
heart rate they just want to see
funny faces.
OTIS
I care about the fucking heart
rate! Okay?
JAMES
Alright heart rate man. They want
to see funny faces but okay.
(reads from script)
“Jeff, come on it’s been over an
hour. I gotta date with Dewey... I
gotta get in there and do my hair.
What are you doing in there?”
Otis is breathing hard now, with the remote controller in his
hand like a dumbbell. Starting to make some genuinely funny
faces as he says each word with each rep.
He flares his nostrils...

64.
OTIS
“What... If... I... Was... Doing...
Some... Thing... Stupid... In...
Here... Jac... Que... Lin...”
James laughs. It’s good. He joins in and they both grunt and
flex. James reads again from the script.
JAMES
“Uh, as opposed to this?”
OTIS
“I know you wanna hang out with
your secret buddy”-JAMES

Otis sits on the bed with two fingers in his mouth.
James slams the door and sits on his bed.

There’s a pounding KNOCK on the door. James opens it. It’s
Mama DJ. He immediately closes it.
No! Nope!

JAMES (CONT'D)

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.
INT/EXT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM / DOORWAY
James opens it and points at her with his copy of the script.
JAMES
Get off my door!
She takes a step back.
MAMA DJ
I will do that. I understand that
but you gotta respect me and my
girls are over there chillen at our
party enjoying ourselves, ok?
Otis looks through the window and sees Little Q peering
inside. She smiles and waves at him. He shyly waves back.
MAMA DJ (CONT'D)
You knew it was a spot when you
moved in here and it is what it is.
JAMES
It is what it isn’t! It ain’t what
it fuckin’ ain’t! So why don’t you
get your silly ass back over there.
MAMA DJ
You actin’ like you run somethin’?
She THROWS her drink at him and it smashes against his wall.

MAMA DJ (CONT'D)
You don’t run a damn thing! You

I think it’s ok-JAMES
Ya but I don’t think it’s ok so
we’re gonna keep going til you make
me laugh or we’re going to do it

We now realize this is the memory from Otis’s rehab dream.
OTIS
Give me a fucking cigarette, dad.
JAMES
You want a cigarette? Here.
James FLICKS HIS LIT CIGARETTE at him; it hits Otis in the
head and falls on the floor.

67.
JAMES (CONT'D)
There, you happy now, Little Lord
Fontenroy. You got a cigarette now.
Go ahead and smoke it.
Otis rubs his head where it hit his hair.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You just gonna let it burn a hole
in the carpet... I don't give a
shit, you’re paying for it. Do what
you want.
Otis doesn’t move.
OTIS
You know I’m doing you a favor...
by paying you to be my chaperon.
Who else is going to give a felon a
job? I’m not stupid.
JAMES
I don’t like when you talk to me
like that. I don’t like you talking
to me like I work for you.
OTIS
You do work for me. I’m your boss.
JAMES
You know what? Don’t say another
fucking word. I’m about to lose my
shit. You’re pushing me over the
fucking edge. You understand what
I’m saying? I don’t have to be
here. I could be gone in a second.
I could be pulling eight, ten grand
a week.
OTIS
...I want you to be here Dad.
JAMES
Didn’t I tell you not to say
another word?
OTIS
I want you to be-JAMES
Shut the fuck up!
James JUMPS off his bed and HOLDS his hand over Otis’s mouth
while pressing him into the bed.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Didn’t I say don’t say another
fucking word? Say one more word!
OTIS
(pleading through his
dad’s hand)
I want you to be here!
JAMES
Now you want me to be here? I can’t
figure out who you are Actor Man.
He removes his hand from Otis’s mouth and sits back down.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What the fuck do you want me to be
here for? Give me one good reason.
OTIS
You have good instincts.
JAMES
I’m from the mud. I got rodeo clown
instincts. I couldn’t make it in
Hollywood... I like pussy too much!
OTIS
You could if you started when I
did.
JAMES
Yeah... Then what?... Then I could
have been something? Stand around
getting paid to fucking pie fight?
Doing push ups?
Otis starts to tear up. James can’t watch.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Wipe your face Otis. Don’t cry in
front of me. I’m not going to ask
you again, Otis.
They both sit there, staring at the ground.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You keep pushing me...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - AFTERNOON
Against the matte painted blue sky we saw in the opening,
sits Otis, in a plush coat, sunglasses and bling rings.
A long table covered with everything good is stretched
between him and the camera.
Next to him is his Butler, ROYSTON, dressed in a suit and
massaging Otis’s shoulders the whole time. They look out of
place in the sand pit set.
By the plastic palm tree stands Otis’ T.V. Dad, an American
dreamboat, who on “Action” is walking toward the sand pit.
T.V. DAD
This culinary spread is
beautisimiss, Jeff.
OTIS
It’s all thanks to Royston.
T.V. DAD
Thank you, this is splendid
Royston.
OTIS
This is splendid Royston.
T.V. Dad assesses his son.
T.V. DAD
What has gotten into you son?
Otis pulls keys out of his pocket.
OTIS
You know what, here... Here’s the
key to the new house... take that.
T.V. DAD
Wait, Jeff. What’s going on here?
Royston nods politely and moves to massage Otis’s neck.
T.V. DAD (CONT'D)
Is that what you think this is all
about? You think I’m leaving you
because mommy and I bought a second
house?
Otis takes his sunglasses off.

70.
OTIS
Well... Yea.
T.V. DAD
Royston, do you mind?
OTIS
You heard him, Royston.
Royston nods and leaves but not before making sure Otis’s cup
is full of fresh coffee.
OTIS (CONT'D)
So you’re staying?
T.V. DAD
Of course. Do you really think I
would leave you and Royston behind?
OTIS
Wow... I just thought you didn’t
love us anymore...
T.V Dad puts his arm on Otis's shoulder.
T.V. DAD
I love you, Jeff... I love you more
than words can say.
Otis is feeling far more than what this kids show requires.
And...
CUT!

DIRECTOR (O.C.)

Otis looks for his father’s eyes and sees him talking to a
woman backstage.
T.V. DAD
(to Otis)
Hey are you feeling alright?
Otis puts his sunglasses back on.
CUT TO:
INT. VISTA MOTEL - NIGHT
CLOSE ON OTIS: Same vibe.
He sits in the chair in the doorway, looking at his father’s
bike. He is smoking and fidgeting with his leg.

71.
James is laying on his bed.
ON THE T.V.: The video of Otis and the T.V. Dad’s scene.
We stay here long enough for Otis to smoke half his
cigarette. He turns toward his father.
Dad.

OTIS

James is totally into the TV, unaware of Otis's gaze.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I need you to hear me. I’m gonna
say some things that I gotta say
and I need you to not interrupt me
or run off...
CLOSE ON: Otis’s face staring into the lens, the glow of the
T.V. flickering off his face.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I was thinking the other day when
you asked me about the Rodeo and
Tom... I was thinking about what
other happy memories I had of you
and me and I swear to god... I’ve
always been waiting for you to act
like a real dad. You haven’t done
that one time.
Back in the room: James’s face frozen watching TV; eyes to
us.
Then... We see Otis enter his frame in profile.
James keeps his eyes on us. Otis leans close to his father’s
ear and whispers.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I’ve missed you for a longtime,
dad.
James's face is frozen. Eyes into the camera. He slowly turns
to his son and stares into his eyes.
Left eye to left eye.
JAMES (AUDIO LIP SYNC OF T.V DAD)
I love you Jeff... I love you more
than words can say.
James wipes his son’s tears away and tenderly holds his face.

72.
WIDE AGAIN: Otis never left his seat.
From the bed, James sees Otis crying in the doorway.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What are you crying for?
Otis tries to wipe away his tears. He realizes his cigarette
is burnt to it's end when it burns his fingers. He FLICKS IT
AWAY and puts two fingers in his mouth to calm down.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Go pick that up.
Otis walks to the parking lot to retrieve the butt then
reenters the room.
JAMES (CONT'D)
What are you crying about?
OTIS
What? Wh.. I’m not.
JAMES
You're crying about something.
Tom.

OTIS

JAMES
Oh, for fucks sake...
OTIS
He still fixed our passports after
you threatened to face-fuck his
dead family.
James looks at him.
OTIS (CONT'D)
You're a sex offender. He’s a
federal employee! Don’t you think
you should...
JAMES
He kept pushing it.
Otis gets right in his face.
OTIS
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
This is the first time we’ve seen Otis like this. James’s
voice remains steady and calm.

73.
JAMES
Don’t talk to me like that.
OTIS
LISTEN TO ME AND LET ME TALK.
JAMES
Lower your voice Otis.
OTIS
I want you to be a better dad to
me. Promise me. Put your pinky out
right now and promise me you’ll be
better.
JAMES
I’ll be better...
James offers up his pinky. Otis slaps it away.
OTIS
This is not a joke. This is not one
of your stupid little jokes.
Long beat.
JAMES
What is this then?
OTIS
The end of our agreement.
JAMES
End of our agreement? I’ll tell you
what, I hear you man. You want a
better father, a father that
teaches you lessons and stuff? And
you deserve one. You do.
Otis sits on his bed. They face each other.
JAMES (CONT'D)
So I’m going to try harder. We’re
going to start fresh right here,
right now. Lesson number one all
smart guys know, if you can hit
your boss once...
James SMACKS all vitality out of his boy. WHACK.
CLOSE ON: James’s face. Pure anger.
We hear Otis moaning.

74.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Then you can hit him twice.
WHACK...
JAMES (CONT'D)
Don’t talk to me like that.
Otis is coiled up on the bed crying.
Go away!

OTIS

James gets up.
JAMES
Gladly, pal.
Through the doorway we see James walk outside, get on his
bike, gun it and go.
EXT. VISTA PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Otis, sentimentally walking out to the parking lot. Passing
units on the way. Some with open doors. We pass an OLDER
WOMAN in a wheelchair in front of her unit smoking.
He cries as he goes.
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
James rides on his bike. We don’t know where he’s going.
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Otis heads back toward the debased car junk yard in the back
of the hotel. He’s smoking a Kool and looking up at the moon.
He sits on a car and rocks back and forth.
CUT TO:
INT. REHAB - OFFICE - AFTERNOON - 2005
Otis is sitting on the floor against the wall. Dr. Moreno
sits on a special mattress for back support.
Otis is barely reading from a note pad as tears streak his
face. His voice is breaking.

75.
He holds his index to a post it on the wall marked: DAD.
Points to his Dad.
OTIS
I make a lot of people laugh son. I
know what’s funny. This is shit
right now...
Points to himself.
OTIS (CONT'D)
Give me a cigarette, Dad.
Points to his Dad.
OTIS (CONT'D)
Not until you get this scene.
You're gonna make me laugh or were
gonna do this all fucking night.
Points to himself.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I’m doing you a favor... by paying
you to be my chaperon. Give me a
fucking cigarette, Dad.
Points to Dad.
OTIS (CONT'D)
Whoa. You're doing who a favor?
To himself.
OTIS (CONT'D)
You... Who else is gonna give a
felon a job? I’m not stupid.
Dad.
OTIS (CONT'D)
I don’t need you to do that...
Otis breaks. We hear his pain.
Beat.
DR. MORENO
What are your S.U.D.S. now?
Otis explodes and gets up.

76.
OTIS
I DON’T FUCKING KNOW! I’M NOT A
FUCKING NUMBER!!! I CANT...
FUCK!!!... I’M... It hurts, What is
the fucking point of putting a
number to it?
DR. MORENO
So we can chart progress.
OTIS
FOR FUCKING WHO!?!! If this works
I’ll know won’t I?
For court.

DR. MORENO

Beat. He sits down.
80.

OTIS

Dr. Moreno writes it down.
DR. MORENO
Let’s bring it down.
Oh my god.

OTIS

Otis shakes his head.
Cactus...
(snap)
Window.
(snap)
Notebook.
(snap)
Carpet.
One more.

OTIS (CONT'D)

DR. MORENO

Otis can’t look at her.
OTIS
YOU’RE A RIDICULOUS PERSON YOU KNOW
THAT? YOU THINK YOU’RE SMART
BECAUSE YOU GOT ME TO ACT FOR YOU?
I’VE BEEN DOING THIS SHIT MY WHOLE
LIFE FOR A LIVING. Wouldn’t I know
if it works? You’re running my
entire fucking life...
(MORE)

77.
OTIS (CONT'D)
It’s all bullshit. How am I
supposed to have therapy with my
probation officer??
DR. MORENO
Name one more thing.
Beat. He looks at her.
Deep breath.
You...

OTIS

She’s there.
He calms down.
OTIS (CONT'D)
The only thing my father gave me
that was of any value to me is
pain.
Dr. Moreno nods.
OTIS (CONT'D)
And you want to take that away?
Can I?

DR. MORENO
FLASHBACK TO:

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT - 1995
Little Q comes up behind Otis.
She throws her robe over his face and wipes gone his tears.
She holds his face in her hands through the robe. After a
long, long beat he moves his hands to hold her hands holding
his face.
They stay like this rocking back and forth under the good
looking Los Angeles moon and then back up and look at each
other.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. BARE ELEGANCE LAX - NIGHT
James enters a fairly vacuous strip-club.

78.
He walks up to the bar and orders a drink. He sits close to
the restroom, smoke machine blasting in his face.
WAITRESS approaches, hands him his drink. He murmurs in her
ear. She appears to agree. He stuffs money in the check
sleeve.
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Otis starts doing a little Mime routine...
Little Q answers it with a little dance.
INT. BARE ELEGANCE LAX - RESTROOM - NIGHT
James crushing two O.C’s on the sink counter of an open
faucet. Small piece of scalded tin foil. Suck it in through
the straw. Cherry ignites. We hold it.
Hillbilly heroin.
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Otis miming he’s dead...
INT. BARE ELEGANCE LAX - RESTROOM - NIGHT
James is all sweat.
Lights the bottom again. One more. Then a look in the mirror.
He looks down into the sink. The running faucet over-flowing.
Water is covering the whole floor.
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Little Q brings Otis back to life. He rises. She pretends to
pull him towards her like a puppet on a string.
They hug. They dance.
EXT. VISTA POOL - NIGHT
Otis dives into the pool.
We stay with him underwater. He touches the bottom then
shoots back up to the surface.

79.
INT. BARE ELEGANCE - NIGHT
James tries to keep his eyes open while a STRIPPER performs.
He dives into his Oxytocin dreams.
CUT TO:
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT - THE NEXT MORNING
James rides his bike back into the lot.
EXT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Otis and Little Q are in bed together.
They hear James pull into the lot. They immediately JUMP UP
and try to make the bed.
James staggers in. Looks them over. Little Q in her robe. He
stops.
Beat.
JAMES
What are you doing here?
He closes the door.
LITTLE Q
I’m looking after your son.
Otis sits in the bathroom. He knows what’s coming.
Otis?

JAMES

Otis gets up and enters the main room. Silent.
JAMES (CONT'D)
(back to Little Q)
You fucked my son?
She shakes her head “no”.
LITTLE Q
You fuck your son.
James charges at her and she slaps him.
He falls to the ground and she runs out the door. He calls
out to Otis from the ground.

80.
JAMES
Get my glasses!
Otis slowly hands him his specs.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You fuck that woman?
OTIS
She’s just friendly.
JAMES
She doesn't give a shit about you
Otis. You think she gives a
“friendly” fuck about victims?
OTIS
I’m not a victim.
JAMES
It’s a crime is what it is. You're
twelve years old. That’s a victim.
Wake up. You think what? You're her
friend?
Otis stares at James...
OTIS
I love her.
JAMES
Fuck you; you love her.
I do.

OTIS

James goes to the bathroom, gets on his knees and THROWS UP
into the toilet. Otis looks away.
JAMES
(head in the toilet)
Love sells diapers pal.
OTIS
She holds my hand. You slap me in
the face.
JAMES
I’m your father. Can't buy that.
OTIS
Yes, you can. I do...
Beat.

81.
JAMES
Don't... Don’t fucking push me.
OTIS
I’m not scared of you.
James gets up and sits on the closed toilet.
JAMES
Don’t I know it. Fuck this shit. I
don’t want to be here no more.
OTIS
You can't leave.
JAMES
I can do what the fuck I want. I’m
an adult. You can’t leave.
OTIS
Fine. Take me with you.
James takes a sip of water.
JAMES
Fuck off. Call Tom and tell him to
pickup some applesauce and take you
camping...
OTIS
Let me in dad.
JAMES
Fuck off. You’re in. You are SO
fucking in! You made it. HEY-O! I
never could. Congratulations! Good
on ya, honey boy!
James claps then back to staring at the bathroom floor.
OTIS
None of it’s real though.
JAMES
There it is though isn’t it? None
of it’s real... it’s more valuable
that way. That’s my fucking advice.
That’s my fatherly advice, you
picking up on that? Chase the
bullshit forever, man.
OTIS
Mother says--

82.
JAMES
Your mother says a whole lotta
shit, your mother. It’s naive. Real
world the truth is wood rots. Stone
crumbles. People fucking die.
That’s the real world. The only
thing that is going to live on is
fables and stories and dreams-OTIS
I don’t understand?
JAMES
You’re twelve fucking years old.
OTIS
I want to understand. I want
stories-JAMES
You get stories every week. You
pull them out of the envelope. You
don’t need me for stories. You make
your own stories.
(a long beat)
How do you think it feels for me to
get to have my son talk to me the
way that you talk to me? Have my
son paying me... how do you think
that feels?
OTIS
You wouldn’t be here if I didn’t
pay you.
James starts to cry. Ugly cry. Hands on his forehead.
Otis watches. He’s near tears too.
James looks at his son and takes out a cigarette and lights
it. Otis mirrors his dad and does the same.
JAMES
Horse trade. You stop putting me
down. You stop shitting on me and
bringing up the past. I can’t get
out from under it and I’ll teach
you what I know. I’ll give you what
I have.
Ok. Deal.

OTIS

From the bathroom James reaches out his pinky.

83.
Otis moves closer. He reaches out his pinky and they each
kiss their hand to lock in the pinky swear.
CUT TO:
EXT. REHAB - TENNIS COURTS - 2005
Otis is following something we can’t see.
DR. MORENO (V.O.)
There’s no quick fix. But you can
start from here. You need to get
rid of what doesn’t work Otis...
He sees the chicken. He walks towards it.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. VISTA MOTEL - BEDROOM - 1995
The same scene as before.
James in the bathroom. Otis in the living room.
JAMES
I’m growing, son.
OTIS
I know. I see it.
JAMES
Fuck you, you see it. I’m growing
marijuana on the side of the
freeway. ‘Sensemilla’ on the 101.
Dad...
What?

OTIS
JAMES

OTIS
What if they catch you again?
JAMES
Who is ‘they’?
OTIS
The police. The city.

84.
JAMES
The city? They water it for me...
no trail. This crop works you and
me are going to build a tree house
on the fucking moon. Trust me honey
boy, I’m your father.
Otis smiles, “ok”.
EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY EVENING
James and Otis ride on the bike. Otis holds onto his dad and
closes his eyes.
CUT TO:
EXT. REHAB - CONTINUOUS - 2005
Otis keeps walking towards the chicken.
JAMES (V.O.)
You know the older you get you
learn a couple of things about
life. You get to know what you come
from. Now you come from a line of
alcoholics, son.
BACK TO:
EXT. 101 BANK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS - 1995
James and Otis pull up to his crop on the side of the
freeway.
Bike parked. Otis is wearing the bright yellow “Adopt-AHighway” vest.
JAMES (O.S.)
You wanted a tree house?
Otis surveys the plants and smiles.
JAMES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Yes sir... Man of my word.
Otis runs through the greenery.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Get in there! It’s yours.

85.
Otis kneels and holds a plant.
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK - 2005

A long line of good people who were
hurting and didn’t know what the
fuck to do so they drank a lot.
FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. 101 BANK GARDEN - 1995
James leans in close by Otis.
OTIS
It’s sticky!
JAMES
That’s magical stuff right there.
That’s god, pecker-wood.
Our boys are in a world of their own. James puts his arm on
Otis. It is as affectionate as we’ve ever seen them.
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK - 2005
Otis watches the chicken cross the road. He continues after
it.
JAMES (V.O.)
Every single one of us got a
grudge. Every single one of us got
somebody that fucked us over. I
know you got one. You gotta lay the
grudge down. Or it’s going to
fucking kill you.
EXT. VISTA PARKING LOT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Otis follows the chicken into the lot he grew up in. He walks
towards his dad’s bike.
He sees the door to their room is open.

86.
James appears in the doorway dressed in FULL CLOWN COSTUME.
He waves to Otis then starts to perform a miming routine.
Otis stands there frozen and watches.
FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. 101 BANK GARDEN - DUSK - 1995
Otis and James sit on the side of the freeway. Otis between
his father’s legs. James holds a joint in Otis’s mouth.
We stay on him as he blows a cloud of SMOKE... And then it
comes.
A PAINFUL COUGH.
A proud James smiles and laughs.
JAMES
You know a seed has to totally
destroy itself to become a
flower... And doing that is a
violent act, honey boy.
CUT TO:
EXT. VISTA PARKING LOT - NIGHT - 2005
Otis approaches James in the clown costume.
A tense moment. They hug. A big hug.

Nobody is mad at me anymore.

87.

Huh?

OTIS

JAMES
That’s all I ever wanted.
The chicken walks by them.
JAMES (CONT'D)
You’ll get there too.
He hands Otis a lit joint. Otis inhales and smiles.
OTIS
I’m going to make a movie about
you.
JAMES
You’re making a movie about me?
Otis nods, “yeah”.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Well, Make me look good honey boy.
CUT TO:
EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROAD OUTSIDE TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
Our boys cut through it like a crazy knife on wheels.
Otis and James are gliding down the freeway. It’s a tight
operation. Otis at the helm, James holds tight. He moves with
his son. Hugs him at 120 mph.
Full Speed Love.
CLOSE ON: Otis in the front this time around.
High rises bulging through the thick haze of Los Angeles
smog. The Sierra Madres bitching in the distance.
Our boys flying down the freeway. It’s an expert working
unit.
Only they know where they’re going...
Until we realize it’s just Otis on the bike.
FADE TO BLACK
