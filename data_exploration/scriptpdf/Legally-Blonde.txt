INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY

1

"HEAD OVER HEELS" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a
flock of abstract, silky, golden strands — PULLING BACK, to
discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.
But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the
blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.

*
*

We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade
card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts
and glitter surrounding and "Good Luck Tonight!" and "Elle
and Warner forever!."

*
*

She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
the hall, into the room of —
THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom
routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card
Girl out and into the room of —
A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a
Stairmaster as "General Hospital" plays on a tiny TV. She
signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to
the room of—

*

A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of —
A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE
GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being
signed, as the drinks go the other.
Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we
follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
reaches the very last and biggest door —
She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
the card under the door.

The CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of
UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth
and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
strappy sandals.
An equally perfectly manicured hand with a "Sisters Forever"
charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.

As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned
legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
encased in a spaghetti-strap top — until we finally reveal a
magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta
Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.
ELLE
(into the phone)
I love you, too!

Behind her, a "Go USC" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A
stack of "Cosmopolitan"s and "Glamour"s teeters on the
dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
in a predominance of pink.
ELLE (CONT'D)
(continuing; into phone)
I'll see you tonight.
She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's
head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,
touched.
ELLE (CONT'D)

"Elle and Warner forever". Aww...

A Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful
college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
who they're going to sleep with next.
The main wall of the living room has been designated as a
"Model Wall" of Delta Gamma girls — ELLE smiles at us from a
Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A
cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC
cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA
in a pom-pom pose.
Serena walks up, fending off an admirer.
SERENA
Jeremy, enough! I am not going to formal
with you.
Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated.
MARGOT
Can someone please tell Rick that he is
not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

As they head toward the door, Elle spots AMY, a shy girl in a
Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.
ELLE (CONT'D)

Amy, what's wrong?
AMY
I don't really — know anyone.
ELLE

Serena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror,
trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress. Sexy and ultratight.

ELLE
Too demure?
MARGOT
I think you should go with red. It's the
color of confidence.
ELLE
Well, I don't want to look like I know
what's coming. . .
SERENA
I don't understand why you're completely
disregarding your signature color.

She holds up a tiny pink slipdress.
ELLE
He's proposing! I can't look like I
would on any date. This is the date. The
night I'll always remember. I want to
look special. Bridal . . . but not like I

I can't wait to see you wearing The Rock!

Elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.
ELLE

it's not like he's trying to impress you.

Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back

ELLE
Is this a low-viscosity rayon?

Uh, yes — of course.
ELLE
With half-loop top-stitching on the hem?

Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be
excited.
ELLE
It's impossible to use a half-loop
topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It
would snag the fabric. And you didn't
just get this in, because I remember it
from the June Vogue a year ago, so if
you're trying to sell it to me at full
price, you picked the wrong girl.

The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.
MARGOT
(to the saleswoman)
Nice try...

Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips
on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check,
smoothing down her golden mane.
ELLE

Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll

The reason I wanted to come here tonight

. According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney,
who was also a private sperm donor, was
allowed visitation rights as long as he
came to terms with the hours set forth by
the parents. So, if we're sticking to
past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't
stalking— he was clearly within his
rights to ask for visitation.
PROFESSOR DONQVAN

But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor,
and in our case, the defendant was a
habitual sperm donor, who also happens to
be harassing the parents in his quest for
visitation.

very wealthy husband was found shot to

Gold digger?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN

You'd think so, since the stiff was
sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some

She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge

class at the LA Sports Club. She's

What's the point of staying? All people
see when they look at me is blonde hair
and big boobs. No one's ever going to
take me seriously. The people at law
school don't, Warner doesn't — I don't
even think my parents take me seriously.
They wanted me to grow up and become a
Victoria's Secret model who marries a
rock star. Now, for the first time, it
seemed like someone expected me to do
something better with my life than wear
underwear for a living. But I was kidding
myself — Donovan didn't see me as a
lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass.

First, your Honor, I ' d like to point out

there is no crime without a vicious will.

Emmett clears his throat, worried. Elle turns around, giving

I have a point. I promise.
JUDGE
Then make it.
Elle looks at Chutney.

ELLE
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's
curls were ruined when she got hosed
down?
CHUTNEY
Because they got wet.
ELLE
That's right. Because isn't the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
least twenty-four hours after getting a
perm at the risk of de-activating the
ammonium thiglycolate?

perms? — throughout her lifetime, be
well aware of this rule?

Chutney doesn't answer.

She just glares at Brooke.

ELLE (CONT'D)
(continuing)
And if you, in fact, were not washing
your hair, as I suspect you were not,
since your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

Chutney continues to glare.
ELLE (CONT'D)
(continuing)
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot,
then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had
time to hide the gun before you got
downstairs. Which would mean that you
would've had to have found Mrs. Windham
with a gun in her hand to make your story
sound plausible. Isn't that right?
CHUTNEY
She's younger than I am. Did she tell
you that? How would you feel if your
father married someone younger than you?
ELLE
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your
father?

Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing.
