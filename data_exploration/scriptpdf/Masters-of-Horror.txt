INT. ELLEN'S CAR -- NIGHT
CLOSE on the right eye of ELLEN. She stares straight ahead.
A MELANCHOLY SONG PLAYS as we PULL BACK to REVEAL her face.
SONG
It's good to hear your voice
It's good to hear your breathing…
She is a dark-featured, attractive woman in her late 20s.
As the camera pulls back, it becomes apparent that she is
at the wheel of a car, gazing at the road coming at her. A
serious, enigmatic expression paints her face.

I'm running out of hours…

You're gone…
ANGLE ON the broken stripes of road paint rushing by.

INT. ELLEN'S CAR – MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON Ellen, still in her trance.
SONG (CONT'D)
Everybody wonders what
We did wrong…
She reaches over to fiddle with the radio. The signal is
WEAK and GARBLED. Her eyes momentarily leave the road as
she checks the dial.
After a beat, she looks up. Her eyes go WIDE and she
SCREAMS.
POV through the windshield on a BUICK parked in the middle
of the road. She is headed straight for it.
She jerks the wheel and SLAMS on the brake.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen's car SLAMS into the rear of the Buick.

INT./EXT. ELLEN'S CAR ON THE MOUNTAIN ROAD – MOMENTS LATER
VARIOUS ANGLES as the car goes SKIDDING across the pass,
bounces back off the railing and just barley avoids a
nosedive off the end of the cliff.

INT. ELLEN'S CAR – MOMENTS LATER
As the car HURTLES to a halt, Ellen bounces against the
steering wheel and is pounded into unconsciousness.
The car comes to a stop on the other side of the Buick.
We hold on her face, eyes closed, only for a second before
we-CUT TO BLACK
A MAN'S VOICE begins.
BRUCE (V/O)
I believe anything can happen to
anyone...anywhere...at any time.

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFÉ -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
BRUCE faces us from across a table at a trendy sidewalk
eatery. He seems a few years younger than Ellen, handsome
and rugged, with a devilish flirt in his eyes. There is a
charming energy and even humor in his voice.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
I learned that when I was a kid. I
also learned you gotta roll with the
weirdness.
REVEAL a slightly younger, happier-looking Ellen sitting
across from him. She listens intently.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
You know? Because to me, the world is
a pretty fucked-up place, Ellen.
Ellen nods. Bruce gives a small smile.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Sometimes it just makes me want to go
out there and shoot all these
assholes.
They share a LAUGH. She eyes him seductively, a flirty grin
on her lips.
ELLEN
So I guess you don't think the meek
shall inherit the earth?
BRUCE
What, this?
He glances around the café.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Nah. They can have it.
ELLEN
It's not so bad…
(smiles)
If you don't think about the price of
gas and the commuter traffic.
BRUCE
You see now, that's fucked-up part.
The gas, the traffic. You know, people
are getting mad about it too. They
are. If you ask me, one of these days,
the whole thing's just gonna blow up.
(beat) (more)

BRUCE (CONT'D)
I mean, did you know that in Thailand,
you can sell your baby, your 5-year
old kid, to a sex shop? I mean, you
can do the same thing here. The only
difference is that you can't advertise
for it.
Ellen gives a seductive half-laugh.
ELLEN
Are you always this charming on a
first date, Bruce? Or do I just look
like a girl who's really interested in
what's going on in Thailand?
She plays with her hair and smiles. Bruce smiles back.
BRUCE
Sorry. I get a little worked up
sometimes. I apologize.
She nods. They share a long look.
ELLEN
Do you wanna get outta
here?
Bruce smiles.

EXT. BRUCE'S CABIN – LATER – FLASHBACK CONT'D
There is a FLASH OF LIGHTENING and a CLAP OF THUNDER as
Bruce's FOUR-BY-FOUR pulls to a stop in front of his cabin
nestled in the woods. RAIN POURS DOWN.
ELLEN (V/O)
Wow. God, this place is awesome.
BRUCE (V/O)
Yeah. My dad built it when I was
little. We used to come up here every
summer and go hunting.
POV through the windshield on Bruce and Ellen. The WIPERS
SLOP back and forth.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Man, it's really coming down. God, I
hate the rain.
The driver's door opens and he hops out into the pouring
rain.
5

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Whew! Oh, man!
Ellen does the same, letting out a playful SCREAM as the
rain soaks her.
ELLEN
Ah!
BRUCE
Oh, Jesus!
Bruce dashes up the stairs for shelter beneath the front
porch awning. They both LAUGH. Ellen spreads her arms wide,
letting the rain soak her through.
ELLEN
Oh! I love the rain!
(beat)
Oh, I love it.
She takes in a deep breath and spreads her arms again.
Bruce makes his way down the stairs. She LAUGHS. He moves
close to her and looks into her eyes.
BRUCE
Well, you look really good
in it.
She smiles.
ELLEN
Well, thank you.
They share a beat of tense silence. He cups her face in his
hands and pulls her to him. They kiss.
The LIGHTNING CRASHES as we CUT TO--

INT. BRUCE'S CABIN – LATER – FLASHBACK CONT'D
Ellen and Bruce charge through the door, their lips locked,
tearing at each other's clothes. QUICK CUTS as LIGHTENING
FLASHES. They tumble onto the couch and make love with
unbridled, animalistic passion.
She turns her face as he kisses her neck to REVEAL her
expression of rapture. CLOSE ON ONE DARK EYE as she opens
it.
SHOCK CUT TO--

6

INT. ELLEN'S CAR -- RESUME
Ellen's head rests on the steering wheel. Her eyes are
open. There is a rumble of THUNDER and a FLASH OF
LIGHTENING. Ellen blinks. She takes a deep breath and lifts
her head. Cagey, she glances around. All is silent.
She looks through the windshield at the empty road. She
thinks for a beat, then winces as she places a hand to her
head.
ELLEN
Oh, my God.
She pulls down the rearview mirror to examine a SMALL
LACERATION at her hairline.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Oh, shit.
She twists the keys in the ignition and the engine
SPUTTERS. She grabs her purse and fishes out her cellphone.
She taps out a number, but gets nothing.
She pops open the glove compartment and pulls out a SMALL
FLASHLIGHT. She checks it and finds that it works.
She gathers her purse and opens the door.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD – MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON the rear license plate of her car, which reads
"Oregon – RNI 8H4."
ANGLE ON the driver's door as Ellen gingerly gets out. She
spots the Buick behind her. Its lights are on and it
doesn't appear to be seriously damaged.
ELLEN
Oh, great.
She glances around in the darkness.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Hello?
She shines her flashlight towards the Buick.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

7

Cautiously, she approaches. The driver's door is partially
ajar.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Hello?
She moves up to it to find that the car is empty. She
glances up to the treetops. An odd, SCREAMING SOUND is
heard–perhaps animal, perhaps human.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Hello?
She turns back to the Buick and pulls open the driver's
door. Her eyes widen at what she sees.
REVEAL a BLOOD-SPATTERED garment on the passenger side and
MORE SPATTERS on the driver's seat. Ellen shines her
flashlight down and finds a THICK SWATH OF BLOOD. It TRAILS
from the car across the pavement to a steel railing.
Ellen stands at the railing. She shines her flashlight down
the CLIFF.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Hello?
ELLEN'S POV looking down the mountain. A steep dirt incline
leads about fifty feet into a thick forest. Halfway between
the trees, a DARK FIGURE lumbers through the brush.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Are you okay down there? It was my
fault! I-There is no response from the approaching figure as it
comes into better view. He is large and wears a LONG CLOAK
and a WIDE BLACK HAT that obscures his face. We see now
that the lumbering gait is caused not by a limp, but by the
heavy object he drags behind him.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
My phone doesn't work! I can't call
for help.
The Figure shuffles up the incline toward her. Ellen
narrows her eyes and shines her flashlight for a better
look. The Figure continues towards her, stumbling but
determined. Suddenly, she GASPS.
ELLEN'S POV on the bloodied, slashed-up face of a YOUNG
WOMAN as it drops out from behind the shuffling Figure. She
stares straight at Ellen with a look of horror.
8

YOUNG WOMAN
Help me!
Ellen's eyes go wide. At just this moment, the Figure lifts
his head and doffs his hat to REVEAL himself.
This is MOONFACE. He boasts an ENORMOUS BALD HEAD, CHALKY
WHITE SKIN, and BLOODSHOT EYES. He GROWLS at Ellen,
REVEALING a set of wicked SILVER CAPPED TEETH.
Suddenly, in a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Moonface wields his razorsharp hunting knife and slashes at Ellen, sending her
stumbling back onto the pavement. Her cellphone skitters
across the road.
Ellen backpedals on her feet and hands, GASPING. We see now
that she is dressed in a skirt and high heels.
Moonface GROWLS as he leaps onto the railing and is framed
by the light of the ENORMOUS FULL MOON. He LANDS on the
pavement with a THUD.
He moves in on Ellen, who leaps to a crouching position.
She glances this way and that. She spots the phone, but it
is out of reach.
Moonface slashes the air before her. She leaps up and
throws herself over the railing, the blade cutting air just
past her head as she vanishes into the void below. She
half-nosedives/half-tumbles down the hill, rolling and
stumbling, but finally managing to right her forward
flight.
ANGLE ON Moonface as he glares down the incline, GROWLING
after her. LIGHTNING strikes, illuminating his features for
a brief second.
CUT TO--

EXT. WOODS – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen GASPS and PANTS as she barrels through trees and
underbrush in a full-on terrified panic. LIGHTENING FLASHES
as she runs. Moonface races behind her.
QUICK CUTS as the chase continues. Ellen's breath comes
short and ragged. Moonface GROWLS. FLASHES OF LIGHTENING
providing momentary illumination through the dark branches
and foliage.

9

Ellen races along. Suddenly, she TRIPS over a root and
STUMBLES to the ground. She GASPS. Recovering herself, she
glances behind her and finds nothing. She leans against a
tree and catches her breath.
CUT TO BLACK
Bruce's voice begins.
BRUCE (V/O)
You've always got to expect the
unexpected, and do the unexpected.
CUT TO--

EXT. TRAIL THROUGH WOODS – DAY -- FLASHBACK
Bruce and Ellen jog over a SUSPENSION BRIDGE in a beautiful
canyon on a summer day. Both dressed in trail running gear.
Bruce jogs backwards so that he can face Ellen as he
speaks.
BRUCE
See, that's what'll save you when some
wacko who wants to put the hurt on
you. You act just as crazy as they
are, and they don't know what the fuck
to do with you.
They stop in the middle of the bridge.
ELLEN
And what happens if crazy doesn't
work?
BRUCE
Oh, crazy always works.
He wraps his arm around her and pulls her close.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
But if it doesn't…
She smiles.
ELLEN
Yeah?
BRUCE
You fall back and you fight with
whatever's available to you.
He looks up.
10

BRUCE (CONT'D)
You see it?
ELLEN
What?
BRUCE
This.
ANGLE ON the lovely rippling water and towering trees
surrounding them.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
All this wilderness. You can really
use it to your advantage, you know?
She smiles.
ELLEN
Oh yeah?
BRUCE
Yeah. You could take a tree and rig a
sling, or you can pick up a sharp
stick and gouge someone's eye out.
She laughs. He strokes her cheek.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
My point is, as long as they don't see
it coming, then you've got the edge.
Okay?
ELLEN
I think you've got to catch them
first.
He moves in for a kiss.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Yep.
She wrests free and races off.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
You do.

11

BRUCE
Really?
She gives a PLAYFUL SCREAM as she charges across the
bridge. He races after her.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
You did not just call me out like
that. I'm going to get you, woman!
She giggles.

EXT. CLEARING – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen runs up to a large field set before the cabin,
laughing. Bruce runs after her and catches up quickly.
BRUCE
I'm right behind you! Yeah!
He tackles her and they tumble to the grass together.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
I guess I'm too fast for you, huh?
Bruce rolls on top, pinning her to the ground. She smiles
up at him.
ELLEN
I let you catch me.
BRUCE
I don’t think so.
ELLEN
Yes.
BRUCE
No.
They stare into each other's eyes for a beat. She smiles.
ELLEN
Let me up.
Bruce stares into her eyes. His own expression has
darkened, and there is a coldness to him that we haven't
seen before.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Bruce, let me up.

12

He does not respond.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Let me up.
She grabs his jacket and tries to pull herself up, but he's
got her pinned.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Let me up.
He grabs her hand and helps her up. She looks into his eyes
as he studies her intently.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
What?
BRUCE
It's time to do the
unexpected.
A small smile tugs at his lips. He reaches into his pocket
and fishes something out.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
What do you say?
Ellen stares at Bruce's hand, speechless. REVEAL a
beautiful DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING, glinting in the
sunlight. He waits for her reply.
CUT TO--

EXT. WOODS -- RESUME
A FLASH OF LIGHTENING illuminates Ellen's teary eyes. She
leans against the tree. Her breathing is RAPID.
ANGLE ON Moonface as he crunches through the brush, paces
away.
Ellen grits her teeth.
ELLEN
Do the unexpected.
FLASH OF LIGHTENING illuminates her purse nearby.
Moonface's boots strike the ground, very close now. Ellen
breaks cover, pounces on her purse and hits the ground
running. He follows.

13

BERSERK POV SHOTS as they run. Ellen's feet slam into the
ground, slogging through wet muck and leaves, while
Moonface follows at a terrific pace, narrowing the gap
fast.
Ellen happens upon a series of fallen trees, all overgrown
with heavy brush and vine and leaves, completely blocking
her path.
ELLEN
Oh, shit!
She turns and her eyes go wide. She SCREAMS.
REVEAL Moonface not 10 feet away, his fists clenched, his
silver teeth bared. He GROWLS.
Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she loses her footing and
stumbles back against the mass of trees. Moonface pulls his
KNIFE. It WHOOSHES as he SPINS it in the air and catches it
by the blade. He waits a beat, then HURLS it straight at
Ellen's head. There is THWACK as it lands in a tree, just
inches away from her. Moonface charges towards her.
She squeezes through the fallen trees. In a flash, he rips
the knife out of the tree and comes after her. They crawl
beneath the vines and briars on their bellies, Moonface
quickly narrowing the gap. He takes a savage stab at her
legs with the knife. She SCREAMS and kicks back at him. His
face falls into the dirt.
She struggles out of her coat and squeezes under another
thick branch, leaving it behind. She scrambles up to a
thin, low-hanging branch. She grasps it and tests it
tension. She grows calmer, as if she now has an idea.
She jams her hand into her purse and fishes out a pair of
cosmetic scissors. Moonface GROWLS behind her. She SNAPS
the branch in two and jams half of it into the ground. She
then fits the finger holes of the scissors into the
abutment she has created, blades pointing out. She sets
this contraption against the second half of the branch. She
grabs her purse and races off.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Eat that, you motherfucker.
ANGLE ON Moonface. He finds his knife in the dirt and
continues to wriggle along on his belly.
He crawls up to her booby-trap and grasps the branch,
sending the scissors FLYING.

14

Ellen proceeds through the woods. She stops mid-flight as
she hears Moonface SCREAM. She waits for a beat, hears
nothing more, then continues along.
Moonface GROANS as he wrenches the scissors from his eye.
He CLAPS a hand over his wound and GASPS.
Ellen races along. LIGHTENING FLASHES and THUNDER CLAPS.
She stops short at a large, natural DEPRESSION in the earth
about five feet deep. She teeters precariously at its edge,
her eyes wide.
CUT TO BLACK
Bruce's voice begins.
BRUCE (V/O)
When everything else fails you, try
anything.
CUT TO--

EXT. SHOOTING RANGE – DAY -- FLASHBACK
Ellen FIRES A PISTOL three times. REVEAL her TARGET. She
hits it handily, but misses the vital areas.
Satisfied with her own work, she removes her EAR PROTECTORS
and turns to Bruce with a smug smile. Bruce examines her
work.
BRUCE
I really thought you'd be better then
that by now.
Ellen laughs.
ELLEN
Well, we all can't be as rough-andready as my darling husband now, can
we?
BRUCE
You know what? That's exactly the kind
of thinking that's going to get you
hurt.
She nods.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
All right? You're pulling your trigger
and that's why your shots are all
going wild.
15

ELLEN
Okay. It's getting late. I told John
and Aimee we'd meet them in town for
dinner tonight.
Bruce loads his gun.
BRUCE
All right. We'll see.
He FIRES, putting each of nine shots directly in the center
of the TARGET'S HEAD. Ellen looks to it, unnerved.
CUT TO BLACK
Bruce's voice begins.
BRUCE (V/O)
Balance is everything. Nature is
balance.

INT. BRUCE'S CABIN – NIGHT – FLASHBACK CONT'D
A FIRE ROARS in the fireplace. Bruce WHOOSHES a LARGE
HUNTING KNIFE with quick flicks of the wrist. He catches it
by the handle and POUNDS it into the floor. He then goes to
work assembling an AK-47 RIFLE. Ellen looks on, not happy.
ELLEN
I guess I'm going to make some dinner.
You want anything special?
BRUCE
No, I'm not hungry. I'm just gonna
walk the perimeter and call it an
early night. I've got a big day
tomorrow.
Ellen watches him for a beat.
ELLEN
Getting together with those survival
freaks again?
He looks up at her.
BRUCE
You don't know what you're talking
about, Ellen, so I'm just going to
ignore that you said that, okay?

16

ELLEN
(deadpan)
Okay.
(whispers)
You ignore everything else I say, so…
He stares at her.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
I mean, Bruce, you are really freaking
me out right now. We don’t even go out
anymore. You spend all your day with
those nut jobs. We don't even have a
house in the city anymore.
Bruce stands.
BRUCE
The cities aren't safe anymore, Ellen.
You will thank me when the shit
happens. When the Big One drops, we
can just wait it out here while those
mud people rise up and fucking kill
each other.
She stands.
ELLEN
What is this shit you're even talking
about, huh? I don't understand
anything you say to me anymore, and
I'm your wife!
Bruce moves to the door.
BRUCE
I'll be a few hours.
ELLEN
Fine.
Alone, Ellen glances around. She crosses to the fireplace
and looks at a FRAMED PHOTO of herself and Bruce on their
wedding day, dressed for the occasion and smiling for the
camera.
PAN TO a larger FRAMED PICTURE of Bruce in full military
gear, posing with a rifle, along with a assortment of GUNTOTING BUDDIES. Ellen considers it for a beat, then turns.
She pulls the knife from the floor and tries Bruce's wrist
flicks, She spins the knife, but it CLATTERS to the floor.

17

EXT. WOODS -- RESUME
CLOSE ON Ellen's shoe as it comes down on a medium-sized
TREE BRANCH, cracking it in half and creating an almost
perfect spear-like edge. She jams it, point up, into the
pit.

EXT. WOODS – MOMENTS LATER
She rips HUNKS OF FOLIAGE from the nearby bushes and tosses
them overtop the depression, creating a camouflaged
DEADFALL TRAP.
ELLEN
(whispers)
Okay. Okay.
She hikes up her skirt and slip off her UNDERPANTS. She
quickly tears out the ELASTIC WAISTBAND. She dumps her
purse out and rifles through the contents. She finds a HAIR
ELASTIC, then paws around for something else.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Where are you? Where are you? Where
are you?
She finds what she is looking for--a mean-looking NAIL
FILE. She holds it in her mouth as she wraps the elastic
around a long twig, then slides the nail file beneath the
elastic. She quickly tears off a long piece of the hem from
her skirt.
She threads the elastic from her underpants across the
abutment of a small tree, then grabs the swatch from her
skirt and ties it around another long twig. Moonface GROWLS
behind her.
She holds back the elastic with the long twig and positions
the nail file in front of it. She trails her skirt hem
along the ground and ties it to a stake, fashioning a
TRIPWIRE.
She ducks behind a tree and waits in silence.
ELLEN
Come on.
(whispers)
Come on.
LIGHTNING FLASHES.

18

ELLEN (CONT'D)
Come on, you bastard. Come and get me.
ANGLE ON the silent, motionless trees.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Come on, you bastard.
(raises her voice)
Come and get me!
Finally, the foliage CRACKLES ahead of her. Ellen GASPS and
crouches low.
A DARK FIGURE lurches towards her. A FLASH OF LIGHTENING
REVEALS that it is Moonface's victim, the Young Woman.
ELLEN
Oh, no.
She whimpers as she holds out her duct-taped wrists and
proceeds towards the pit, oblivious to her surroundings.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
No! No! No! No! No!
Ellen leaps towards the Woman.
ELLEN
No! No! No! No!
There is a LOUD CRACK as the camouflage gives way. The
Woman plunges straight down. She hits bottom with a THUD
and SCREAMS.
Ellen clamps her hand to her mouth in horror. POV into the
pit on the Woman. She CRIES OUT. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
REVEALS the stake below, driving right through her upper
thigh. She HOWLS in pain.
A conflicted Ellen considers this for a beat. Sensing
something, she whirls around to find Moonface right behind
her, his knife drawn. He GROWLS.
Before she can move, he grabs her right by the throat. She
GASPS. ANGLE ON the booby trap she has constructed, the
nail file GLEAMING in the moonlight. Moonface stumbles
backwards, tripping the skirt hem and sending the nail file
flying.
Surprised, he lets go with a GRUNT. She looks down to find
that the file has impaled her shoulder, six inches deep.
She SCREAMS, then breaks the twig off.
19

Disoriented, he glances over his shoulder to see the nowtripped booby-trap. Ellen stumbles off into the woods.
YOUNG WOMAN
(screams)
Help me!
Moonface looks to the pit.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Oh, God! Help me!
She CRIES and SCREAMS. POV into the pit as a FLASH OF
LIGHTENING illuminates her horrified expression. She
SCREAMS.
CLOSE ON Moonface as he looks down on her. Slowly, he draws
his finger to his lips.
MOONFACE
Shh.

EXT. CRUCIFIX ROAD – MOMENTS LATER
GASPING AND PANTING, Ellen staggers out of the thick woods
and crashes to her knees in the middle of what appears to
be a road or a clearing. She catches sight of something O/S
and SCREAMS.
PAN UP an odd construction of a BODY wrapped in BURLAP and
BARBED WIRE, tied to an ENORMOUS CRUCIFIX. A ROTTED, almost
SKELETAL FACE looks down at her.
Ellen stumbles to her feet and looks around. She finds
another of these grim scarecrows next to the first, then
another, and another, and more after that, lined up along a
road that stretches about fifty feet to a smallish log
cabin, from which a weak light emanates.
Ellen stumbles down this "Crucifix Road," hyperventilating
and crying. She rushes towards the house and stumbles up
the porch, where she finds herself face-to-face with a
ROTTED CORPSE in a wheel chair on the porch. She CRIES and
SCREAMS, flailing this way and that.
She heads for a path, but not two feet along, finds herself
at the CLIFF'S EDGE, overlooking churning RIVER fifty feet
below. PAN UP the opposite side of the cliff to REVEAL
another cabin.

20

She turns to double back, but stops short at the sight of
Moonface. He stands before her, SNARLING and HISSING, the
Woman's body at his side.
Ellen SCREAMS. QUICK SHOTS of the CRUCIFIED BODIES, which
are illuminated with intermittent FLASHES OF LIGHTENING.
Ellen CRIES and SCREAMS.
ELLEN
No! Please!
Moonface lumbers towards her. Suddenly, she loses
consciousness and passes out, slumping limply to the
ground.
CUT TO BLACK
Bruce's voice begins.
BRUCE (V/O)
You're weak, Ellen. You've always been
weak. I knew it the first time I met
you.

EXT. BRUCE'S CABIN – DAY -- FLASHBACK
In her hiking gear, Bruce and Ellen march up to the front
of the cabin.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Pitiful. You were born weak.
ELLEN
Then why the hell'd you marry me,
Bruce? What the hell are we doing
here, huh? What's the fucking point of
any of this?
BRUCE
Because I want to teach you something.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Look at me Ellen.
She turns to him. He points at her.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
I wanted to make you strong.
(beat)
And I know you've got potential. I
know you do. I know it's in you, and I
will not let you prove me wrong.
She shakes her head. He pulls his knife.
21

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Show me.
He holds it out to her.
ELLEN
Are you kidding?
BRUCE
Take the knife.
(beat)
Please. Take the fucking knife. Do it
for me.
ELLEN
Oh, come on.
BRUCE
(shouts)
Take the fucking knife, Ellen! Show me
what you've got. Come on.
ELLEN
So it all comes down to this?
His eyes are steely.
BRUCE
You bet your life.
Exasperated, Ellen grabs for the knife. He yanks it away
from her in mockery. She eyes him, grabs it again, and
attempts his wrist-flicks. She manages a couple of good
throws before it tumbles to the ground. She SIGHS.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
That was pathetic.
She stares at the ground.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Pick up the knife.
She moves for it, eye still fixed on the ground. He slaps
at her wrist.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Don't take your eyes off me.
She glares at him, then crouches into a practiced "sweepand-clear" fighting pose. She sweeps her leg at him. He
hops back from it.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Whoa!
22

She leaps up and stares him down.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
All right.
(beat)
You want to cut me? Come on! Come on!
She lunges for him. He ducks her easily, then grabs her and
pins her arms behind her back. He whispers into her ear.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
See? I knew you could do so much
better.
He gives her butt a firm slap and shoves her away.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
(gestures to his face)
Come on. Come on, cut me.
She takes several swipes at him with the blade, all of
which he dodges successfully. He grabs her arm. She reaches
out and SLAPS him across the face. Aghast, his eyes go
wide. He lets go of her.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Give me that knife.
He reaches for it.
ELLEN
No.
As she leaps back, she SLICES his hand. He grasps it,
shocked. They share a long silence. At last, Ellen takes a
deep breath and shakes her head
ELLEN
I'm leaving you.
On a speechless Bruce.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
I can't do this anymore, Bruce.
(beat)
I'm sorry.
She holds the knife out to him.
BRUCE
Everybody's sorry for something,
Ellen.
(beat)
I'll survive.
23

He moves off. She stares after him for a beat, then emits a
small SIGH.
CUT TO BLACK
Bruce's voice comes up.
BRUCE (V/O)
Ellen, you can survive anything.
FADE IN:
INT. MOONFACE'S CABIN -- BASEMENT – RESUME
CLOSE ON Ellen's bruised and bloodied face as she lies
unconscious in a dark room, the nail file still jutting
from her shoulder. The sounds of DRIPPING WATER can be
heard.
Ellen rouses. She GASPS as she sits up to find herself
handcuffed to a pole. She glances this way and that. The
room is dark and grimy, dimly lit with GAS LAMPS. She
catches sight of something O/S and SCREAMS.
REVEAL TWO DEAD BODIES, their EYES ROTTED OUT, leaning
against a grimy wall. Ellen SCREAMS as she struggles to her
feet.
ELLEN
Oh, no!
She looks this way and that, and finds more ROTTING
CORPSES. She CRIES OUT and struggles with her handcuffs,
but it is no use.
ELLEN
(cries)
Oh, no.
Behind her lies the Young Woman, motionless, her face and
body covered in bloody lacerations. Ellen SCREAMS and
crouches back down to the floor.
Suddenly, in a jolting shock, one of the "corpses", a lanky
old man, BUDDY, sits up in his wheelchair and GASPS for
air. He COUGHS and SPUTTERS. Ellen's jaw drops.

24

BUDDY
Oh good lord, it smells bad in here!
When is he going to clean it out, by
golly? If there's one thing I can't
stand, it's a messy house! And no
matter how much I sleep, whenever I
wake up it's still the same messy
house!
He wheels closer to her and we get a better view of his
grizzled face and SOILED CLOTHING. His eyes widen as he
spots Ellen.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Hi.
(beat)
I'm Buddy. Not too many come up that
road. Maybe one a night. Didn't make
the turn in the road either, huh?
Ellen trembles and GASPS, her eyes wide as she continues to
take in her horrific surroundings.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Well, one in ten usually don't. He's
had a real backlog lately.
(beat)
Did you bring any candy? I like it
when they bring candy. Sweets pass the
time so much faster, don't you agree?
Ellen lurches forward and VOMITS.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
I'll take that as a "maybe."
Ellen clamps her hand to her mouth and cries.
BUDDY (CONT'D O/S)
Your friend is pretty.
CLOSE ON the Young Woman's body.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
He must think you're both very
special. He didn't kill you like the
last two.
Buddy jerks his chin at the first two corpses.

25

BUDDY (CONT'D)
They was bad girls. Kind of nasty, you
know. I guess they sort of deserved
it.
(beat)
Do you know what they did?
Ellen shakes her head.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
They wanted to do…sexy things with
him. Said they'd do anything he wanted
if he didn't hurt them. But he doesn't
want sexy things. Those things are
bad. You see so many bad things in
your life. It all comes in through
your eyes. And sometimes your eyes lie
to you. And show you things you don't
want to see. So he makes them go away.
At last, Ellen manages to speak.
ELLEN
Where…are we?
BUDDY
You've come home.
(beat)
I've been here waiting for you. Well,
I was waiting for someone, I guess. It
might as well be you. Might as well be
anyone, really.
ELLEN
What…what the fuck is he?
BUDDY
His face is like the moon. So
beautiful. I used to call him
Moonface, but he didn't like that for
long. Thought I was making fun of him.
Ellen's breathing is short and rapid.
ELLEN
That sick bastard. He cuts out their
eyes?

26

BUDDY
(dismissive)
Oh, he does that with everyone, girl.
I thought we was clear on that
already. You have to be on certain
terms to relate to him and the eyes,
well…they're usually the first things
that have to go. I guess we're lucky,
you and me.
ELLEN
Why hasn't he killed us?
BUDDY
Reasons. There must be a million
reasons. He might be busy. After all,
he has to move those cars miles away
to dump them so that no one can ever
find us.
Ellen considers this.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Oh, he's so smart.
ELLEN
Listen to me, okay? I left my
cellphone up on the road. I can get
you out of here. Okay? If you can get
me out of these
(shows him her cuffs)
I can leave and go get us help. Okay?
BUDDY
Sorry.
Buddy holds up his own arms, which are also cuffed.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
I would if I could, but I can't so I
won't.
Suddenly, there is a THUMP from upstairs. DUST rains down
on Ellen. She looks up to the ceiling. Ellen struggles
frantically with her cuffs. Buddy launches into another
rant as the THUMPING draws nearer.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
So, about the candy. Did you bring
any? What's your name anyway? I'm
Buddy. Did I tell you that already? We
can be good friends for a while. I
think he really likes you—

27

ELLEN
(interrupts)
Shut up!
BUDDY
We could sing some songs! Do you know
any songs?
Through the slatted roof, Ellen sees a FIGURE STOMPING
overhead.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
I know lots of songs!
The basement doors are thrown open. Light from above shafts
down on Ellen's terrified expression. Buddy instantly
wheels back into the darkness and hangs his head.
Moonface STOMPS down the stairs. He stares at the
trembling, tearful Ellen for a long beat. He then crosses
to the Young Woman and SNAPS a SWITCH on a mysteriouslooking gadget. He pulls a ripcord and suddenly ROAD CREW
WORK LIGHTS flood the cellar with blinding light. SIRENS
BLARE and the room is REVEALED more thoroughly in the
light. We see the full effect of Moonface's work—each
corpse has had its eyes drilled out.
Ellen squints and recoils, blinded and terrified by the
display. As her eyes adjust, she can make out the focal
point of the basement-A large DRILL PRESS in the center of the room, powered by a
WHIRRING GENERATOR and complete with a table and straps to
hold a body down. The main drill bit is attached to a large
mechanical arm and there is a crank to one side.
Moonface scoops up the Young Woman on the floor and carries
her to the table. He positions her so that her head is
directly beneath the drill and straps her down. Coming to,
the Woman MOANS. Ellen looks on in horror.
Moonface gives the leg strap a final yank, eliciting a
horrific SCREAM from the Woman. Realizing what's happening
to her, she CRIES. Moonface clamps his hand over her mouth,
but he can barely muffle her WAILS.
Ellen struggles with her handcuffs.
CLOSE ON Moonface's hand as he pushes a button. The drill
bit WHIZZES to life. The Woman SCREAMS. Ellen CRIES and
shakes her head furiously.

28

ELLEN
No! No! No! No!
Moonface turns the crank and the drill begins its descent.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
No!
The Woman SCREAMS. Moonface holds her face down and GROWLS.
CLOSE ON the Woman's eye as the drill bit comes down.
ANGLE ON ELLEN. She jerks against her restraints as the
SOUND OF THE DRILL BIT TEARING INTO FLESH is heard. Buddy
winces.
The Woman SCREAMS and her limbs clench. Ellen cries. Buddy
looks on in horror. There is another horrifying SQUELCH,
and then the Woman's feet go limp.
ANGLE ON the drill bit as it pulls back, a slimy spiral of
gore and brain matter. Moonface presses the button. Ellen
CRIES. Moonface kicks off the switch and the generator
POWERS DOWN.

EXT. MOONFACE'S CABIN – LATER
All is silent. A FULL MOON hangs above the cabin.
CLOSE ON the moon.

INT. MOONFACE'S CABIN – BASEMENT – LATER
Ellen stares, wide-eyed, through the dark. REVEAL Moonface
as he drags a crucifix, to which the Woman's body is
affixed.
ELLEN
You…sick…fuck.
Moonface stops in his tracks. He looks to Ellen. She glares
up at him.
He draws a finger to his lips.
MOONFACE
Shh.
He turns and carries his trophy up the stairs. Ellen
trembles and cries. The cellar door SLAMS closed. Ellen
CRIES. Buddy GASPS to life. Ellen WHIRLS around at the
sound.
29

BUDDY
Ain't love grand? We could sing a song
about love.
He wheels up to her.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Did I ask you about that? Do you know
any songs? I like to sing. Singing is
good for the soul.
(sings)
His face was sharp as a butcher's
cleaver
But that did not seem to grieve her
Look away look away look away
Dixieland…
Ellen turns to him.
ELLEN
(yells)
Oh, shut up, you crazy old fuck! Shut
up!
Buddy is clearly stung.
BUDDY
Well, there's no need to
shout.
Ellen continues to struggle with her cuffs.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Oh, please, little girl. You'll only
hurt yourself.
She stands and rubs her cuffs against the pole.
ELLEN
I have to get out of here. I have to
get out of here.
BUDDY
You know, if Dixie is not your cup of
tea, fine, but there's really no need
to be impolite.
ELLEN
Shut up! Just shut up!
BUDDY
Well, what songs do you know?
Ellen cries.

30

ELLEN
Don't you get it? He's going to kill
us. He's going to kill us.
Buddy cocks his head at this.
BUDDY
Don't know any songs, huh?
(beat)
Well, that's okay. There's other ways
to pass the time of day, I guess.
ELLEN
I need to find a way to get out of
here. I need to find a way to get out
of here. There's got to be some way to
get out of here.
BUDDY
Maybe there is. Maybe it's right over
your shoulder?
Perplexed, Ellen glance over her shoulder, but sees
nothing. Turning back, she catches sight of the nail file.
She looks at Buddy.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Go for it.
Ellen stares at the nail file. Steeling herself, she clamps
it in her teeth and gnaws.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
You can make it. I know
you can. Yes. Go deep.
Ellen whimpers.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Deeper.
Tears streaming down her face, Ellen looks up and catches
her breath.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Don’t give up.
She SOBS.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Don't give up. You're strong.
(whispers)
Not like those dirty girls. Not like
the others.
31

Ellen summons her courage.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Don't be afraid. You're strong.
She clamps down one more time and works at the file.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Yes, you can make it. I know you can.
Ellen yanks with her teeth. With a mighty SPUK, the file
pops out.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Yes!
Ellen grabs the file and sets to work unlocking the cuffs.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Ah! Ah! Oh, my dear.
The right cuff opens. She stands and goes to work on the
left. Buddy is impressed.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
My dear, dear, girl.
There is a CLICK as the left cuff opens. Buddy's eyes pop
open and he lets out a victory WHOOP.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Ah! Oh!
Ellen starts for the stairs. Buddy holds up his hands and
slips free of his own cuffs, revealing that he has been
free all along. He stands and starts a victory dance.
Ellen turns to him and holds a finger to her lips.
ELLEN
Shh!
He jabs a finger in Ellen's direction and LAUGHS
maniacally.
BUDDY
She's loose!
ELLEN
Shh!
BUDDY
She's loose! She's loose!

32

ELLEN
Shh! Be quiet!
He points at her and continues his rant.
BUDDY
She's loose! She's loose!
ELLEN
He's going to hear you. Shh!
Suddenly, the cellar doors are thrown open and a SHAFT OF
LIGHT pours down, illuminating Buddy's face. We see now
that there is a gory wound above his left eye.
ANGLE ON the stairs. Moonface starts down. Ellen looks up
in horror. Buddy trots off.
BUDDY
(sings)
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old time things I've not forgotten
Look away…
Moonface ROARS as he descends. Buddy does a jig in his
corner of the room.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Look away look away
Dixieland…
Ellen turns this way and that. She grabs a nearby TWO-BYFOUR and THWACKS him with it. Buddy leaps up and down.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Oh, goody! Goody! Oh, goody! Goody!
Goody! Goody!
Ellen turns on Buddy.
ELLEN
Would you shut the hell
up?
She WHACKS Buddy square in the face. He crashes to the
floor.
Moonface charges Ellen. She holds the two-by-four between
them, but he muscles her up against the wall and pins her
there, the two-by-four under her neck. Using it for
leverage, he lifts her up of the ground. CLOSE ON her
dangling feet.

33

Moonface presses the wood tight against her neck, choking
her. She fumbles under her skirt and produces the nail
file.
With all her remaining strength, she THRUSTS it deep into
his gut. He GROWLS and lurches forward, setting her free.
She scrambles up the stairs.

INT. MOONFACE'S CABIN – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen emerges from the basement and SLAMS the doors down
hard. She starts for the door, then stops in her tracks at
the sight of-A BABY CRIB in one corner of the room, containing nothing
but a BABY-SIZED SKELETON. She GASPS, then whirls around
and breaks for the heavy wood front door. She yanks at the
deadbolt, but no luck.
ELLEN
(through tears)
Oh, come on! Come on!
She kicks and yanks, but finally realizes she can't escape
this way. She turns her attention to the far window, which
is broken.
She runs for it, but suddenly there is a mighty GROWL.
Moonface pops out of the cellar door and grabs her by the
ankle. She crashes to the floor, but manages to kick out at
him, knocking his knife from his hand.
She wriggles free and staggers to the window, ready to
throw herself through, but then STOPS IN HER TRACKS.
POV through the window on the 50-foot drop from the cliff,
straight down into the rocky river below.
Moonface rises to his feet with a GROWL.
Ellen whirls around. Moon face grabs a nearby axe and
SNARLS. Ellen races across the room, then stops. Moonface
looks at her and nods.
Ellen thinks for a beat. CLOSE ON the knife on the floor,
its blade GLEAMING in the moonlight. CLOSE ON the baby
crib, the skeleton in full view.
Ellen sizes up her options. Moonface GROWLS. She lurches
this way and that, setting him off course. Making her
choice, she lunges out of reach and grabs the skeleton,
DUST raining off the CLATTERING BONES.
34

In one deft motion, she brings it up and SMASHES it into
Moonface's face. He reels backwards and clasps his hands to
his head.
Ellen crouches down and grabs the knife. She WHOOSHES it
around in her hand. Her eyes flash wide with grim
determination as she sizes up her victim.
Quickly she flips the knife around in her fingers, just as
we saw Bruce do. An instant later she expertly flips it
around into a stabbing hold. She leaps up and lunges at
Moonface, sinking the blade deep between his shoulder
blades.
She yanks it out. He MOANS. She KICKS him in the butt. He
spins around and kicks her across the room.
Ellen recovers, and, like a seasoned knife fighter, swiftly
slices him across the back. Moonface howls and rises up in
pain, and as he does, he exposes his chest. Seizing the
moment, Ellen slips the blade cleanly between his sternum
and his ribs, burying it up to the hilt.
He staggers back and his momentum sends him CRASHING out
the window. As he flies through the glass, he grabs
desperately for the bed sheets as he falls, sending the bed
FLYING against the wall.
POV through the window, on Moonface, who dangles over the
river, clinging to the bed sheet for dear life. Ellen
stares out the window at him.
ELLEN
Hell of a night…
He claws at the sheet, GRUNTING as he pulls himself up bit
by bit. CLOSE ON the sheets as they TEAR beneath his
weight. Ellen gives a matter-of-fact nod.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Huh, Moonface?
He GROWLS. The sheets continue to TEAR. Ellen turns away,
not even watching as the sheets finally give way and
Moonface FALLS.
We PULL IN on Ellen's vacant face. REVEAL a gun on a shelf
nearby. She grabs it.
MONTAGE-CLOSE ON the barrel of the gun as Ellen loads it with
shells. She gives it a SPIN and snaps it closed.
35

Ellen straps a leather belt around her waist and shoves the
gun into it.
She finds a pair of boots and puts them on.
She finds a crowbar in a far corner of the room.
She THWACKS the front door with the crowbar. With a few
more THWACKS, the deadbolt gives.

EXT. CRUCIFIX ROAD – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen moves away from the cabin with steely resolve, the
crowbar in hand. She moves alongside the crucifixes. An OWL
HOOTS. Her face tenses. She turns to check behind her.
Finding nothing, she continues along.

INT./EXT. ELLEN'S CAR ON THE MOUNTAIN ROAD -- LATER
CLOSE ON the KEYS, which dangle from the ignition. Ellen
turns them, and the engine SPUTTERS to life.
Behind the wheel of the car, Ellen heaves with relief.
She gets out and goes around to the front of the car, where
the hood is propped open. She closes it.
She finds that the Buick is still there, door still open.
She whips around to look behind her. All is still and
quiet.
She moves around to the back of her car and pops the trunk.
Her face is partially illuminated as she gazes down into
it, an inscrutable expression upon her face. ANGLE ON the
trunk to REVEAL—
The DEAD FACE of Bruce stares straight up at her, a look of
confused horror in his wide eyes. His body has been jammed
into the trunk. He is eerily lit by the moon.
An icy Ellen stares down at him.
SHOCK CUT TO-INT. BRUCE AND ELLEN'S BEDROOM – NIGHT -- FLASHBACK
A BRIEF FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Bruce's face, just
long enough for us to see that his eyes are wild.

36

In another FLASH OF LIGHTNING, we see Ellen being thrown
backwards into a large mirror, SMASHING it and sending
glass raining down.
Bruce glares at her for a moment, then bears down.
BRUCE
You fucking bitch! You goddamned
whore!
He CRUNCHES up to her through the glass and yanks her to
her feet. She SCREAMS and CRIES.
ELLEN
What are you doing? What are you
doing? What are you doing?
BRUCE
You make me sick!
He PUNCHES her across the face. She SCREAMS as she CRASHES
to the floor. Bruce undoes his leather belt and glares down
at her.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
I bet you wish you could fight me now!
ELLEN
(through tears)
Oh, my God.
BRUCE
I bet you wish you fucking listened to
me now, don't you?
ELLEN
Oh, stop it, Bruce! Please stop!
He crouches down and sets about tying her wrists with his
belt. She CRIES.
ELLEN
Please! Please! What are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you
doing?
BRUCE
I'm not going to stop. I'll stop when
I'm fucking done.
He hauls her to her feet and throws her face-down onto the
floor. She SCREAMS.

37

BRUCE (CONT'D)
You're acting like a fucking whore,
I'm gonna fuck you like a whore.
ELLEN
Please! No!
He mounts her and rips her skirt. She SCREAMS and CRIES as
he thrusts violently, over and over again, the violence
illuminated by intermittent LIGHTNING.
After a few quick thrusts, he climaxes. He lifts himself
off her and catches his breath. Limp on the floor, she
CRIES. He stands.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
You know what, Ellen? One last lesson
for you. Ellen. The meek will inherit
shit.
Satisfied, he smiles and sighs.
Suddenly, from nowhere, Ellen leaps into frame, throwing
her bound arms around Bruce's neck, using the length of his
belt to catch him in a chokehold.
ELLEN
Oh, I hate you! I hate you! I hate
you! I fucking hate you!
She bears down hard. He thrashes against her, but nothing
can match the strength of her rage.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
You motherfucker!
He crashes to his knees and she rides him all the way down.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
You fucking asshole! I fucking hate
you! I'm going to kill you!
Bruce paws at the shards of broken glass, but it is no use.
She tightens her hold and his eyes go wide.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
I'm going to fucking kill you. I'm
going to fucking kill you! I'm going
to fucking kill you!
She THWACKS his head against the floor and SCREAMS. He
GROANS as she tightens the belt. With one last yank, his
eyes bug out of his head and he goes limp.
38

ELLEN (CONT'D)
I hate you.
He collapses to the floor. Ellen CRIES.
ELLEN (CONT'D)
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She cowers in a corner. LIGHTENING FLASHES.
EXT. CRUCIFIX ROAD – RESUME
All is silent.

INT. MOONFACE'S BASEMENT -- LATER
CLOSE on Ellen's hand as she flips the generator switch.
She pulls the rip cord and the machine ROARS to life.
REVEAL Buddy in the corner, bound to his chair with heavy
rope.
CLOSE ON Bruce's corpse, splayed on the drill press table.
The GENERATOR WHIRS and SIRENS BLARE. Ellen moves up to the
crank and presses the button. The drill bit spins. She
holds his head in position.
Buddy looks on in horror as Ellen calmly turns the crank.
BUDDY
(whispers)
The eyes see all evil. All the evil in
the world.
CLOSE ON the drill bit as it spins up, now dripping with
BLOOD and GORE.
Ellen switches the drill off. Buddy nods, almost reverent.
INT. MOONFACE'S BASEMENT – MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON the now-crucified Bruce, light shining through the
eyeholes. Ellen stands behind, admiring her own handiwork.
Buddy looks on.
BUDDY
Beautiful. He almost looks sad,
doesn't he? Like a crying clown.
Ellen smirks.
39

ELLEN
He's the newest member of the family.
You can call him Uncle Brucey. That's
his name.
(beat)
I have him to thank. It was all his
hard work and determination that got
me out of here alive.
(beat)
The fucking bastard.
BUDDY
I'm so sorry for you.
Ellen turns to Buddy.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
So, so sorry.
Ellen moves up to Buddy, her eyes steely.
ELLEN
Everybody's sorry for something.
She pulls out the gun and points it at him.
BUDDY
No.
CLOSE ON an icy Ellen.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
No.
(beat)
No.
She stares at him for a beat. Slowly, she draws a finger to
her lips.
ELLEN
Shh.
BUDDY
No!
Ellen FIRES.

EXT. CRUCIFIX ROAD – LATER
Mounted high on the crucifix, "Uncle Brucey" now rests amid
the other grim scarecrows.
The lamenting MUSIC from the opening credit sequence
begins.

The rising sun peeks over the mountain.
Ellen's car drives along.
SONG (CONT'D)
I'm running out of hours
I'm running out of reasons…

INT. ELLEN'S CAR – MOMENTS LATER
Ellen is at the wheel, grimy, covered in mud, eyes staring
straight ahead. She has the same strange expression of
conflict and uncertainty we have seen before.
SONG (CONT'D)
Every time I turn around
You're gone…
PULL IN close on her face.

But tonight I won't tell anyone…

Well I should call the cops

No tonight I won't tell anyone
No tonight I won't tell anyone…
