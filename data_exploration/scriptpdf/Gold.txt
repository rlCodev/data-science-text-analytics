EXT. THE JUNGLES OF INDONESIA - DAY
A NATIVE slashes through thick foliage, leading a patrol of
INDONESIAN MILITARY -- shouted commands and radio chatter.
The tribesmen hack through the perimeter of the brush and the
party emerges onto the wide silt bank of a muddy river.
Suddenly WILD BOAR let out a chorus of squeals and scatter
into the brush, and there, splayed on the river bank, we find-A BODY.
One of the soldiers approaches -- the stench is palpable -the body already decomposing.
The soldier finds a wallet, checks the ID -- we don’t see the
identity. The Soldier speaks into his radio.
SOLDIER
(Indonesian)
We have the body...
While from the jungle the eyes of a wild pig can be seen
peering out, waiting to resume its meal.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY
A hand tosses ice into a low ball. Realizes there’s no booze.
Into the cabinet, finds a stashed bottle. The MAN pours a
healthy measure of whiskey. KENNY WELLS (40’s), unshaven,
takes a long drink, masking his nerves. He is a about an inch
from total collapse.
WELLS
Sure I can’t pour you one?
VOICE (O.S.)
No, thanks. I’m working.
The VOICE is calm, in control, authoritarian.
WELLS
All the more reason.

2.
VOICE (O.S.)
Wells, sit. We’ve got a lot to cover.
WELLS
Here I am. Fire away.
Wells raises his glass in a mock toast. He will not be rushed.
He’s got an easy smile and sparkling eyes -- but his face
tells the story of a man acquainted with his whiskey.
VOICE (O.S.)
How did you meet Michael Acosta?
WELLS
The first time or the second time?
VOICE (O.S.)
How did you meet him, Wells?
WELLS
You sure you don’t want a drink?
You’re making me nervous.
Wells sits and faces us. Off the silence -WELLS (CONT’D)
April of ‘88 -- I had three properties
crap out on me in six week period.
SIERRA NEVADA RANGE... TILT DOWN to find Reno against it...
EXT. RENO, NEVADA - DAY
SUPER: Reno, Nevada... April, 1988
-- ROULETTE WHEEL SPINNING, reveal it’s in a grocery store.
-- COWS GRAZING scrubland on the edge of town.
-- OLD CASINOS. Dusty ranches. Tourists. Migrant workers.
-- A ONE-ARMED BANDIT, with a gun “arm,” pays out nickels.
...SLOWLY TIGHTENING as if a dry wind carries us to...
EXT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MORNING
A faded watering hole from the boomtown days.
WELLS (V.O)
I was on the balls of my ass,
scrambling. Not exactly uncharted
waters, but I was in pretty deep...
A beat up ‘79 Caddy Eldorado, covered in a layer of road
grime, it’s bumper held on with wire, pulls into a spot and
dies. For this hour there are already many cars in the lot.

3.
Through a smoky haze, Wells stares out, eyes like a Bukowski
poem. He’s got one lit cigarette as he lights another. Flicks
ashes at the ashtray, misses -- a constellation of burn marks.
WELLS (V.O.)
Ten AM. And I knew the board of
directors had already convened.
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - CONTINUOUS
Wells enters like the cock of the walk, back slapping and
waving hellos, a well-liked regular. His suit looks like it
might have been slept in... more than once.
Middle-age men in bad suits with bad hair fill the tables,
working phone lines and yellow pads. These are modern-day
“prospectors,” promoting bottom-feeder mining stocks. Pass a
couple regulars -- CONRAD “CONNIE” WRIGHT (40’s) and SCOTTIE
NEVINS (50’s) -- doing more drinking than working.
A BARMAID concentrates on scratching a lotto ticket that looks
like the slots: Cherry... Cherry... Cherry! The winning
amount: $5.00 -Wells approaches one of the traders, clamping down on his
shoulders with both hands, working out the knots. This is
BOBBY BURNS (50’s), balding, pouring a shot into his coffee.
WELLS
Bobby Burns!
BURNS
Oh yeah, that’s the stuff...
WELLS
You boys hear about this cowboy’s
tombstone that won the contest for
Best Tombstone? The 5 Rules To Follow
For A Happy Life...
Smiles from the guys at the surrounding tables. They all lean
in to listen. Wells clearly loves the attention.
WELLS (CONT’D)
One: it’s important to have a woman
who helps at home, cooks from time to
time, cleans up and has a job. Two:
it’s important to have a woman who can
make you laugh. Three: it’s important
to have a woman you can trust, and
doesn’t lie to you. Four: it’s
important to have a woman who is good
in bed, and likes to be with you.
(MORE)

4.
WELLS (CONT’D)
(beat)
Five: it’s very important that these
four women do not know each other or
you could end up dead like me.
Everyone laughs. Wells beams, punctuating the punch-line with
a slap on Burns’s back. Burns calls out to the barmaid -BURNS
Whaddayou think, Kay?
KAY is short for KAYLENE, an ex-Jr. Miss Reno, and second
runner-up Jr. Miss Nevada. She loves Joe Montana, horses, and
Kenny, though in reverse order. Kay’s jeans are a half-size
too small, not because she’s trying to be sexy but because
she’s happy.
KAY
I’ll kill him right now.
More laughter. Wells loudest of all.
WELLS
(to Burns)
So, whatcha working? Anything I should
know about?
BURNS
Telmerek. Their Aukland stake, the
bank called the note. I picked up a
bunch of the debt, I gotta flip it
before the call.
Any bites?
Nibbles.

WELLS
BURNS

WELLS
Keep throwing that line.
A pat on the arm and he’s off to the bar where his double
Seagrams is already being poured by ROY BAKER (60’s), sweet
face that’s seen some miles -- like a broken down boxer.
ROY
A little eye opener, Kenny?
WELLS
Breakfast of champions, Roy. Breakfast
of champions.
Wells raises his glass in his signature salute.

5.
WELLS (CONT’D)
To the mother lode.
Wells pounds the whiskey and WE GO...
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - BACK BOOTH - LATER
Wells sits at his “desk” -- the corner booth in the back of
the bar. Working one of the two phones on the table. He
flicks the ash from his smoke into a half full ashtray.
WELLS
(into phone)
...It’s an outstanding opportunity,
which is why I’m calling you
personally. The geologic reports are
encouraging and we’re taking a very
aggressive position. We’re looking at
yields in the high six figures.
A prospectus? ...Of course, I can mail
one right out. I should tell you,
though - this offering is already
oversubscribed. I’m taking out of my
own holdings to cover demand but hey,
we can always get you in on the next
one... I understand. Look, why don’t
I give you a ring this afternoon and
we’ll see if there are any parcels
left. Well, if you just give me...
Click.

Another one that got away.
WELLS (CONT’D)
You have a pleasant day...

He hangs up the receiver and grabs his drink, a HAND stops it
before it reaches his lips.
KAY
11:15, Kenny.
WELLS
Oh, Christ.
He hops out of the booth. Maybe drinking all morning suddenly
not the best idea.
KAY
There’s a fresh shirt in the “office.”
WELLS
Where would I be without you?

5A.
KAY
Sittin’ right here.
Wells grabs his briefcase and heads into his adjunct office.

6.
INT. GREENHORNS BATHROOM - DAY
Fresh shirt laid out. Wells gives himself a sink bath.
Electric shave. Visine. Gargle of Scope.
And WE GO...
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MOMENTS LATER
Wells emerges, transformed, presents himself to Kay.
KAY
It’s a miracle.
WELLS
A million bucks?
Her looks says let’s not get carried away, but she says:
KAY
Two million.
He drains his drink.
WELLS
I’ll come by for you after. We’ll
celebrate.
KAY
I’ll have my dancing shoes on.
Down the bar a NICKEL SLOT MACHINE noisily pays out. They both
see this as a good sign.
WELLS
I’ve got a good feeling about this.
And he’s off. And WE GO:
INT. COLEMAN & MEAD CAPITAL GROUP - RECEPTION - DAY
TIGHT ON a PICTORIAL in Northern Prospector. Wells, in the
reception of a local investment bank, flipping pages. Flip
Flip. Checks his watch, looks at the receptionist, BEV.
WELLS
Any idea how much longer, Bev?
BEV
Shouldn’t be too much longer now,
Kenny. How you been?

6A.
He makes the so-so gesture with his hand. Two bankers enter.
LLOYD STANTON (30’s) and HENRY ANDREWS, even younger, in nicer
suits, with looks on their faces that say, “Let’s get this
over with.” Stanton extends his hand.

7.
STANTON
Mr. Wells, I’m Lloyd Stanton. My
colleague Henry Andrews.
Wells puts on a smile and shakes hands.
WELLS
Good to meet you.
STANTON
Come on back.
INT. COLEMAN & MEAD CAPITAL GROUP - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Stanton and Andrews take seats at one end of the conference
table. Wells stands uncomfortably alone at the other end.
STANTON
What can we do for you?
WELLS
Aren’t we waiting for Clive?
STANTON
Mr. Coleman is tied up in a meeting.
WELLS
No offense boys, but I was supposed to
be meeting with Clive.
STANTON
None taken. But, if you were
supposed to be meeting with Clive
you’d be meeting with Clive.
That stung. Wells takes just a moment to recover. Sits. Slaps
a smile on his face and slides documents across the table.
WELLS
We’re developing some very exciting
properties that are spot-on for your
investor profile: low buy-in with a
sizable upside and the beautiful part
is they’re all only twelve to eighteen
months to cash positive.
Stanton and Andrews listen impassively, scanning the documents.
Manitoba?

ANDREWS

WELLS
We picked up an option on a skipped
claim at auction.

8.
ANDREWS
It’s a ninety day option.
WELLS
Yes, the window is narrow, but there’s
an excellent shale formation that...
STANTON
...Natural Gas? Environmental
impact’s gonna be a bitch. I don’t
like the liability. What’s next?
He dismissively flips the page, leaving Wells to quickly
shift gears.
WELLS
Eastern Utah. We’re sitting on a nice
land-lease opportunity. The
overburden is borax rich so there’s an
immediate revenue source, but the real
prize is in the granite under-shelf.
Our studies point to rich chromium and
nickel deposits.
ANDREWS
There’s a pretty long chain of title
on this claim. No payouts. What
makes you think you’re gonna be
luckier than all these others?
WELLS
All under capitalized. Never got past
development, none of them.
STANTON
Under capitalized? I’m not sure under
capitalized does your situation
justice.
Wells swallows down another helping of pride and pushes on.
WELLS
We’ve hit a down turn, yes, true
enough, but...
STANTON
...Mr. Wells, Washoe has a practical
value hovering just above zero. Your
debt load is untenable and you come to
us with raw land, no infrastructure,
no fungible assets. You can’t possibly
expect us to underwrite this.

9.
WELLS
I’m talking about a small offering
here. If you’ll just look at the geo
you’ll see what I see, which is money.
Stanton looks him in the eye. A beat.
STANTON
Not our money.
He closes the documents with an air of finality.
STANTON (CONT’D)
We can’t help you, Mr. Wells.
WELLS
These are jackpot, gentlemen. You
back away from these - these are
career changing opportunities.
Stanton rises from his chair.
STANTON
If you’ll excuse us.
WELLS
I want to talk to Clive!
Wells stands, his already red face flushing, every broken
capillary showing like battle scars.
WELLS (CONT’D)
My father put Clive Coleman on the
map. He built this goddamn bank!
STANTON
You are not your father, Mr. Wells.
Like a dagger.

Wells stands stunned by the statement.

STANTON (CONT’D)
Bring us something we can sell and
we’ll talk.
WELLS
These are good properties.
STANTON
They’re crap, Wells. Played out handme-downs. I’d be embarrassed to even
talk to my clients about them.
Andrews...
Stanton slides the documents across the table at Wells.

10.
STANTON (CONT’D)
Is there anything else?
Wells gathers up his papers.
WELLS
Yeah. Go fuck yourself.
He grabs his bag and walks out with as much dignity as he
can muster.
Stanton watches him go. He knows he did his job, he kicked
Wells's ass, but it doesn’t mean he has to feel good about it.
There but by the grace of God... Andrews, on the other hand,
is smiling, misreading his boss.
ANDREWS
Not even noon and the guy reeks like a
still.
STANTON
Shut up, Andrews.
EXT./INT. WELLS'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Wells on the street. Tracking with him. Walk of shame. Door
slams. Leans back in his car seat. Trembling.
WELLS (V.O)
That had to be the worst day of my
life.
WE PULL IN CLOSE on Wells's face, panic rising in his eyes...
DISSOLVE TO:
AN AMBER STREAM OF SEAGRAMS splashing over a tumbler of ice.
WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
I’d lost my house and was living at
Kay’s. We were pretty close to losing
that, too.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE...
EXT. RENO NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK
A street of small tract homes. A nice little neighborhood
forty years ago, now it feels a lot like the people who live
here -- tired and in need of attention. It’s getting dark,
that moment the night and soul closes in.

11.
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
The place is small and reflects a woman’s touch, just the
slightest bit girly. Everything worn, humble, but maintained.
On the counter, we see a mess of BILLS, mostly RED NOTICES -Phone. Electric. Gas. Car. Wells sits on the edge of the sofa,
talking on the phone, pitching for his very life.
WELLS
...we’re looking at yields in the high
six figures... Yes, that’s right.
Kenny Wells. Washoe Mining. I spoke to
your wife last week.
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. MORE WHISKEY -- as much spills on the
table as makes it into the glass. On the table, a pretty good
dent in the bottle.
WELLS (CONT’D)
...I’m taking out of my personal
holdings to cover demand... Could you
hold on a sec, I’ve got to take this
call...
IT’S DARK NOW
Wells is now slumped in an armchair. He muzzles the phone and
reaches for his drink.
WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
Washoe Mining, the company my
grandfather scratched out of the side
of a Nevada mountain, that my father
built into a real player.
He drinks with a shaky hand.

Steadies, and downs the rest.

WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
...It only took me five years to run
it into the ground.
He’s blind drunk, struggling to get his mouth around the
words. The fight has gone out of him...
WELLS (CONT’D)
If you could just let me know when a
good time would be for us to sit down,
I’m sure you would see...
But that’s as far as he gets. The hum of the dead line. He
sets the phone down, leans his head against the cold window
and closes his eyes. His breath fogs the glass instantly.

11A.
WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
At the close of that day, Washoe was
trading at four cents a share - if it
was trading at all...
He pulls a cig, last in the pack. Fire flares in his eyes.

12.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
Hand, cigarette, fire, a deep inhale. Wells's eyes -- turning
his attention back to the off-screen voice.
WELLS
Rock bottom, as they say. Pun
intended.
VOICE (O.S.)
You’re avoiding the question, Mr.
Wells. How was the Indonesian venture
with Acosta initiated?
Wells leans back in his chair, a challenge in his expression.
If we want the story, we’re gonna have to indulge him awhile.
WELLS
Relax. I’m getting there.
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Kay walks into the house, still in her sales vest, with its
name tag - “Hi! I’m Kay!” - looking for Wells...
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...who she finds passed out on the sofa. She takes in the
prospectus papers all over the floor, the bottle of
Seagrams, mostly drained.
She stores her tips. Lights one of Kenny’s cigarettes. Pours a
drink. Puts on some music. Through thin curtains sees a
neighbor dragging a trash can around the side of the house.
Kay flops back on the couch next to Wells. He realizes she’s
home and sorta half sits up.
WELLS
Oh Kay. What are we gonna do? Kay?
KAY
Just shush...
And he sags against her, head on her shoulder.
WELLS
What are we gonna do?
KAY
We’ll get by, baby. We always do.

13.
His eyes have eased shut. Which she looks sideways and sees.
She sighs, leans her head back, takes a sharp pull on her cig
and blows smoke up at the ceiling. And we look down at the
tableau through the smoke.
WELLS (V.O)
I had a half a gallon of Seagrams in
me. I should’ve been dead. But I
wasn’t. Instead, what happened was I
had a dream. I mean, literally. I had
a dream.
Camera pushes down, tightening on Wells...
WELLS
Indonesia...

(V.O.)(CONT’D)

Closing on Wells's sleeping eyes. And suddenly WE ARE -EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
WE SOAR above the jungle canopy, diving down through the lush
foliage, emerging atop a jagged ridge overlooking -A PRISTINE JUNGLE VALLEY. A shimmering river winds through.
Everything is bathed in BRILLIANT GOLDEN LIGHT, breathtaking.
WELLS (V.O)
I met Mike Acosta years earlier. That
was the first time. I still had a
little money then and Indonesia was
booming. I was looking for a way to
get in...
EXT. JUNGLE RIVER - DAY
Boots splashing through a shallow creek. A HAND scoops into
shallow moving water and pulls up a fistful of silt. A figure
silhouetted in jungle.
SUPER: INDONESIA - 1982
WELLS (V.O)
...Back then, if you were aiming to
put a hole in the ground in Indonesia,
you wanted Mike Acosta telling you
where to dig.
TIGHT ON miners carrying bags of ore up wooden ladders.
WELLS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
He was what they called a “River
Walker.” A hands-on geologist. The
real deal: Oxford college, MIT.

13A.
And AT THE TOP FIND MIKE ACOSTA, 30’s, giving orders,
squinting against the light, something regal in his bearing.
WELLS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Mom was Venezuelan. Dad, English. Left
when he was little. That’s always
tough.

14.
INT. JAKARTA HOSTESS BAR - NIGHT
Diaphanously clad HOSTESSES lounge with businessmen. Racy as
hell for a Muslim country. Everyone sweating cheap booze.
Acosta holds court at a corner table. Prospectors hang on
every word. Chief among them Kenny Wells.
WELLS (V.O.)
He’d just discovered the largest
copper strike in Southeast Asia and
everyone wanted a piece of him. And
for a half-English guy, his teeth
weren’t all that messed up.
Acosta dumps an ashtray on the table, scatters the contents,
using ashes and burning embers to illustrate his point.
ACOSTA
You got the Nazca plate off South
America, the Pacific plate, Juan de
Fuca, North American, South American.
You’ve got trenches, fissures and
fault lines - Aleutian, Marianas,
Tonga - the plates rubbing and
grinding up on each other - six
trillion kilobars of pressure, ten
thousand degrees Celsius kicking up
geothermic hot spots all along the
Pacific Rim.
He takes them all in with a rogue’s smile... An INDONESIAN
GIRL, who understands no English, hangs on his every word.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Pressure, heat and time. And there’s
no better cooker than right here.
Is he talking about geology now, or where his hand is resting
on the back of the thigh of the Indonesian girl?

15.
WELLS (V.O)
He called it the “Ring of Fire”
theory. And he definitely had
everyone’s attention.
ACOSTA
It’s how I found the copper, and it’s
why I’ll find the gold.
Find Wells nodding along, smitten.
WELLS (V.O.)
I was too small-time to really get his
ear, but I kept tabs on him... And
then I had the dream.
CUT TO:
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - VARIOUS - MORNING
Still drunk, Wells digs through junk piled in a disused room
that houses an old broken down jacuzzi. An empty pool outside
in a concrete yard. He searches a milk crate with items from a
long ago move. Finds an old business card -- MICHAEL ACOSTA.
WELLS
Okay, okay. Here we go.
Now he moves to a dresser, a JEWELRY BOX sits on top. A glance
to the sleeping Kay. And he opens the box. He pulls out an
ANTIQUE PAVE DIAMOND AND GOLD LADIES PENDANT WATCH.
Kay stirs and Wells slips the watch into his pocket.
KAY
(sleepy)
You’re up early.
He gives her a kiss goodbye which turns into a real kiss as
she pulls him down.
KAY (CONT’D)
You wanna talk about yesterday?
WELLS
I’ve got a plan. I’ve gotta go.
KAY
Kenny, listen. Carl had an idea...
WELLS
Carl? American Home Carl?

15aA.
KAY
He said he could get you on, for a
while, if you wanted.

15A.
WELLS
I... I don’t know... I’m not really -KAY
I bought everything you’re selling and
I’m no fool. You could sell ice to
Eskimos.
WELLS
I don’t know, babe. Let me get back
from this trip.
KAY
It’d be temporary. Just til the market
turns.
(a real proposal)
We could fool around in the warehouse.

16.
A moment as he looks at her. All sorts of things going on in
there. It’s love. And the certainty she’s with him. Always.
WELLS
I'll be back soon, a week at most. If
it doesn’t pan out, I’ll talk to Carl.
KAY
Wait. What? Back from where?
And he’s gone. Kay gets up, mystified, about to go after him
when she sees the open jewelry box. Her watch is gone.
KAY (CONT’D)
Dammit, Kenny--!
INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
A GOLD ROLEX PRESIDENTIAL sliding off a wrist. It’s placed on
a counter, followed by a diamond pinky ring, sapphire cuff
links and Kay’s pendant watch.
A ROLL OF CASH changes hands.
WELLS (V.O)
I didn’t think twice. I was on my way.
EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
Pushing as Wells exits, counting his money, wiping frame...

17.
WELLS (V.O.)
It was like I was being called. It was
the gold calling. I know that sounds
crazy, but if you knew that feeling...
If you knew...
As a PASSENGER JET TAKES OFF just over the pawn shop.
EXT. JAKARTA, INDONESIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
The city sparkles -- it’s a collision of tradition and
technology; tall towers and shanty towns; soaring wealth and
crushing poverty. There’s something electric about it.
Super: JAKARTA, INDONESIA
WE FIND Wells entering one of the finest hotels in the world.
INT. JAKARTA PALACE HOTEL - AFTERNOON
Lavish. Everything the name implies. Wells on a house phone.
One cigarette smolders in an ashtray as he lights another.
WELLS
Yeah, Mike, it’s Kenny Wells. I’m in
the lobby of the Jakarta Palace...
leaving another message. We must have
gotten our wires crossed about the
time. Look, I have a few other
meetings, I’ll try and move things
around. Give me a jingle, okay?
He hangs up. He checks where his watch would be. Asks a
passing waiter the time. Still no Acosta. He drinks. Drags on
his smoke and burning ash falls on his jacket, making a hole.
Goddammit.

WELLS (CONT’D)

He starts to furiously brush it off when he hears -Wells?

ACOSTA (O.S.)

And there’s ACOSTA. Calm and confident and smiling.
WELLS
Hey, Mike! Thanks for coming.
good to see you again.

It’s

Does Acosta remember him? Maybe. A hustler trying his best not
to look needy. Disapproving eyes from around the clubby lobby.

18.
ACOSTA
I know a local place, a bit more
color, if you know what I mean.
WELLS
What, they’re not pouring here?
Then Acosta remarks something in Indonesian and a lobby clerk
snaps obsequiously, ushers them toward the lounge.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Now you’re talking, Mike.
INT. JAKARTA PALACE HOTEL - LOBBY - LATER
A discreet bar cart navigates a lounge area now packed with
Jakarta’s international business elite.
WELLS (O.S.)
...So this salesman goes up to a house
and knocks on the front door. It's
opened by a ten year-old boy who has a
lighted cigar in one hand, a glass of
whiskey in the other and a Penthouse
magazine tucked under his arm.
Salesman: "Hello son. Is your mom or
dad home?” The little boy: "What the
fuck do you think?"
Wells laughs loud. A BARMAN mixes their drinks. Acosta takes
his, glances at his watch.
ACOSTA
So, Kenny, what are we talking about?
WELLS
Ring of fire, Mike.

Ring of fire.

Acosta gives a little laugh.
ACOSTA
You’re playing my greatest hits, now.
Fire’s gone out of that one.
WELLS
What are you talking about?

19.
ACOSTA
Ring of fire hasn’t been proven. It’s
the opinion of my fellow esteemed
geologists that the whole thing is,
quoting here, a crock of shit.
Wells takes a moment, the wheels turning, then...
WELLS
Well, what the hell? You called it
wrong, what are you gonna do?
Acosta shoots a look.
ACOSTA
In this game there is no right or
wrong, there’s only hits and misses.
WELLS
So, you still think you’re right?
ACOSTA
I don’t think I’m right. I know I’m
right. There’s gold here.
WELLS
I’m happy you said that, Mike. I truly
am. I believe you.
ACOSTA
I hate to dash your hopes, but don’t
you think others have come along
before you, with the same thought and,
from the looks of it, deeper pockets?
WELLS
Ring of fire is real. I knew it the
minute I heard it. It was like a
lightning strike. I never forgot it.
Acosta laughs. He can’t help it.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Go ahead and laugh. I’m used to it.
But hear this, I don’t just believe, I
know.
ACOSTA
No one will back me on this one.
Wells mixes them both two more strong ones.
WELLS
I will. I’ll get the money.

20.
ACOSTA
You look like you had to rob someone
to get here.
WELLS
Tell me where you want to dig, Mike,
and I’ll make sure the bills are paid.
ACOSTA
You roll in here like we’re old pals?
I’m a mirage, mate. You know jack shit
about who I am.
WELLS
You know it’s out there. I can see it
in your eyes. You still believe.
As Wells says this, we can see Acosta start to believe, maybe
for the first time in a while.
WELLS (CONT’D)
I get it. I was born on the side of a
mountain, too. My father scraped
everything he had out of the rocks. He
died with dirt under his fingernails.
I intend to do the same.
Acosta just might be wavering.

Wells won’t let him get away.

WELLS (CONT’D)
This business wrote me off years ago,
and maybe you’re not running a hot
hand... Let’s prove ‘em wrong. Prove
all of them wrong. And you know why?
‘Cause Ring of Fire is right. Tell me
I’m crazy, I’ll be on the next plane.
Acosta is inscrutable. Wells waits, sweating. Finally:
ACOSTA
You’re crazy.
Acosta rises from the table. He tosses cash down and brushes
past, leaving Wells like a raft with a hole in it.
ACOSTA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Do you have a hat?
DISCOVER Acosta has stopped behind Wells with a kind of this
is the dumbest thing I’ll ever do expression.
WELLS
Yeah, I got a hat.

21.
But Wells is starting to smile.
ACOSTA
Good. I’m taking you upriver.
WELLS
What river is that, Mike?
ACOSTA
The only one that matters.
Acosta walks out. Wells drains his drink. And WE GO...
EXT. TALKING BIRD FISHING VILLAGE - DAY
A fishing village on market day. Talking birds, snake gazers,
and WELLS, weekend sporty, exiting a cab. The DRIVER yells and
points toward the river. Everyone wants to sell him something.
He sees Acosta waiting by a traditional freighter canoe with
the long-shaft outboard. The boatman, OBB, smokes a cigarette.
ACOSTA
You’re late. This is Obb.
Wells eyes the boat warily.
WELLS
That thing gonna make it?
ACOSTA
Let’s hope so.
(messing with him)
Ever seen a Borneo pit viper?
WELLS
Well I tell you, Mikey, I feel like
I’ve met a few -ACOSTA
Drop out of the trees. Good swimmers,
no bigger than this...
(hands 12 inches apart)
But if one gets you, find a phone,
call your loved ones.
Wells looks around. A few native faces. Huts. No phones.
WELLS
(re: their boat)
I went on the exact same thing once at
Weeky-Watchee.
Wells hops on the freighter canoe, rocking the shit out of it.

22.
INT./EXT. FREIGHTER CANOE - KENSANA (KIN-SANA) RIVER - DAY
Obb pulls away from the pier. Wells watches “civilization”
disappear behind a bend. And suddenly DAYAK TRIBESMEN panning
for gold. In 300 yards, they’ve gone 5000 years back in time.
ACOSTA
The Dayak have been panning this river
for thousands of years. That’s how it
got it’s name, “Daya Kensana.”
Acosta lets that hang there, like a tease.
WELLS
Daya Kensana?
ACOSTA
The word, Daya, actually means
upstream... Kensana means gold.
Wells can’t contain his smile.
WELLS
Upstream Gold?
ACOSTA
That’s its name.
WELLS
You gotta be shittin’ me. If I had
invented it, I wouldn’t have had the
balls to name it that.
ANGLES ON THE JOURNEY
Natives pass in a canoe going the other way; wildlife along
the shore; ANGLES from shore, poo rafts next to clothes
washing next to teeth brushing. Wells staring. A snake drops
and swims through the water. Wells coolly lights a cigarette.
RISE UP TO SEE the freighter canoe tiny with a white wake, the
river golden in color, bisecting an endless green canopy.
Wells POVs. Sun and jet lag. The steady buzz of the prop.
Peering from under his hat, water rolling by. His eyes fight
it, then shut. Then Acosta is shaking him awake. River
narrower and darker under overhanging trees.

23.
EXT. KENSANA RIVER LANDING - DAY
The boatman pulls up at a muddy bank. A faint trail goes up
into jungle. Acosta hops ashore and Wells follows.
ACOSTA
So, listen... the Dayak are warrior
people. Probably best known for
Ngayau... headhunting.
WELLS
What the fuck?
ACOSTA
They believe all of a man’s power is
centered in his head. So they take the
head. Doesn’t happen much anymore, but
they’re probably around thinking we’re
traders or someone’s mother-in-law.
Suddenly Wells freezes. There are FACES in the leaves,
watching them. Then Wells realizes Acosta has vanished up a
dense trail. Wells nearly runs after him.
Acosta stands. He has attached a heavy coconut to the end of a
bamboo stick. He tests its weight on the ground. THUMP. Then
sets out again. Thump Thump Thump.
WELLS
Okay, I’ll bite. What is that?
ACOSTA
It makes the king cobras and pythons
think an elephant is coming.
Wells watches every footfall.
OMIT

24.
EXT. JUNGLE STOPPING POINT - DAY
Light filters from high in the canopy. THUMP THUMP THUMP. The
coconut vibrates the earth. Wells follows, drenched in sweat.
WELLS
Getting a world-class case of crotch
rot back here.
(continues, then)
Jesus... How long..?
He stops.
ACOSTA
Forty million years. For the geology
to cook. Then we come along and take
it.
I meant --

WELLS

ACOSTA
I know what you meant, Wells. But
imagine being asked to give up
something you’ve been hoarding for 40
million years? This jungle will test
you, Wells. Hold you up, weigh you,
and decide your worth within an ounce.
WELLS
Do you always talk like this? Like a
book on tape.
ACOSTA
I suppose I do. Do you listen to books
on tape, Wells? Ken Fol-let... Louis
L’Amour... Ed-gar Rice Bur-roughs?
He’s really made a meal of those pulp names.
WELLS
Where are we going, Acosta?
A no look point back over his shoulder -ACOSTA
Up. I want to show you something.
WELLS
Up? How far up?

24A.
ACOSTA
Six, seven miles tops. Watch your
step.
Wells looks up. If there’s a way, only Acosta can see it.

25.
EXT. JUNGLE - TOP OF THE RIDGE - AFTERNOON
Acosta emerges from the foliage into a clearing. Wells
struggles up after -Acosta stands on the edge, staring out like a man who’s come
home. Wells is bent over, sucking air, drowning in sweat...
ACOSTA
Take a look.
Wells looks out and is instantly spellbound -- it’s JUST LIKE
HIS DREAM. GOLDEN LIGHT sparkles over a pristine valley. The
KENSANA RIVER snaking around, smoke from a small village on
the river far in the distance.
WELLS
My God, it’s just like my dream.
ACOSTA
There have been a few folks up here
tapping over the years but they’ve all
focused on the foothills far to the
south, drawn by the basalt overlay.
He points to an area on the opposite side of the valley.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
What interests me is the other way, on
the east bank, up from the river. That
small depression, like a giant left a
footprint walking away.
Far away we see limestone features we will recognize from the
“Washoe site.” True excitement in Acosta’s voice -ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Those limestone structures are 300
million years old, the pale color
comes from skeletons of tiny sea
creatures. But the placer gold I’ve
recovered there is much older.
Something happened there, Wells.
Something hot and angry. That’s where
we’ll find the tasty bits.
But Wells is barely listening. He’s transfixed.
WELLS
My dream... It’s out there...

26.
ACOSTA
Damn right it is.
Two men together, staring out at their destiny, and WE GO:
EXT. KENSANA VILLAGE - DUSK
A small village on the river. A vendor scoops rice onto flat
leaves, grilling some kind of meat over an open fire. He puts
the two portions up on a flat board.
Wells goes for his wallet. Acosta stops him, producing a small
pouch. He removes a pinch of GOLD DUST, sprinkles it on a
scale on the vendor’s cart.
ACOSTA
Coin of the realm around here.
(beat)
When you think about it, Gold is
utterly useless. Copper, Iron,
Beryllium, Palladium, Bismuth, these
are metals you can do something with.
But the one that’s good for nothing is
the one that everybody wants. Does
have a quality though. When you hold
it in your hand, it does something to
you.
Weights are adjusted, a little more dust -- no one can take
their eyes off the sparkling gold.
WELLS
Like get you to spend your whole life
looking for it.
EXT. KENSANA VILLAGE - DUSK
ACOSTA
...so the lease is currently held by a
Brazilian company.
Acosta sits comfortably, eating. Wells searches his pockets,
finds a couple of mini-bar bottles of scotch, and a packet of
airplane peanuts. Offers one of the bottles to Acosta.
WELLS
Only chance you got of surviving
what’s in that bowl of microbes.
ACOSTA
...They’re looking to unload it cheap getting buried on some Kazakh venture.
Wells finds some peanuts from the plane. Eats them.

27.
WELLS
You know, Mikey, I’m starting to love
how you talk. And the first thing I’m
gonna do is move some paper.
ACOSTA
None of the big guys will touch us.
In Wells we see a touch of the old confidence returning.
WELLS
You want to raise money from the big
boys, from Harvard endowment or some
pension fund, I am not your guy. But
the little guys, the guys you’ve never
heard of... those are my guys. How
much do we need?
ACOSTA
Seven, seven-fifty to start.
Ouch... Wells takes a beat to re-focus.
WELLS
But how much are we gonna need?
ACOSTA
It’s not just the lease. We must first
procure a permit, which in Indonesia
means lining pockets. There are
capital costs, too. Equipment. You
don’t just do this with a couple
shovels and a pick-axe.
WELLS
I’ll get the money. Whatever it
takes.
Wells is about to wipe his face with his NAPKIN, but has a
sudden idea. He pulls out a pen and quickly scribbles
something down on it then slides the napkin over to Acosta.
ACOSTA
What’s this?
WELLS
A contract. Read it.

Sign it.

Acosta looks over what Wells has written on the napkin. They
share a look -- a moment. WE DON’T SEE WHAT’S ON THE NAPKIN.
ACOSTA
Fair enough.

28.
WELLS
We got a deal?
Acosta signs and sticks his hand out to Wells.
Deal.

They shake.

ACOSTA

INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY
WELLS
For the first time in my life, I was
selling something I believed in. I
could feel it in my bones.
Wells up, remembering the energy. Reveal more of the space: a
pastiche of several eras, kind of a luxury camp mixed with a
whorehouse.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Any real salesman will tell you...
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. Wells, please sit down.
The voice belongs to PAUL JENNINGS, early 40s, buttoned-down
shirt, conservative suit, but a fun tie that was probably a
gift. A tape recorder is on the table. Two other men, BANKS
and LEVINE, both 30’s, skeptical, watch as Wells takes his
seat again.
WELLS
...If you believe it, you can sure as
shit sell it.
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - MORNING
BURNS
(braying into the phone)
Hell yeah it’s risky...
Bobby Burns standing mid-pitch.
BURNS (CONT’D)
I’m being straight here. But hey, no
risk, no reward, right?
It’s the usual crowd, but the mood is electric. Everyone’s
working the phones, telling versions of the same story.
CONNIE
Acosta! Largest copper strike in
history. Yeah, that guy. We got him --

29.
NEVINS
Platinum resume. Pla-ti-num. Oxford.
MIT. That’s right: The Copper King -BURNS
Kin-sana. Indonesia. It literally
means River of Gold. No, I’m not
fucking kidding.
Camera finding Wells AT THE BAR with his own phone, taking in
snippets of the phone pitches.
WELLS
(into phone)
It’s a 20k minimum buy-in and shares
are flying off the shelf.
Kay, passing with a tray of drinks, as Kenny tries to pull her
over. She shrugs out of his grasp and continues on.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Babe, this is fucking crazy -BURNS
Going like hotcakes. Hotcakes!!
Connie covering the mouthpiece, interrupts over -CONNIE
I’m batting 500. BabeFuckingRuth.
Every other call, Kenny.
WELLS
Keep throwing the line.
(into phone)
The best. What’d I tell you? The best.
(calling to Kay)
Babe, shine those dancing shoes, get
‘em ready -She flips him off. It’s not a forever anger, but she’s angry.
ACOSTA (O.S.)
We don’t even have the exploration
rights. What are they selling?
WELLS
They’re selling the story, Mike. And
right now, the story is you. Hey,
speaking of which, what are you doing?

29A.
ACOSTA (O.S.)
I’m down in Kupang City, looking at
coring equipment.

30.
WELLS
(yelling to the guys)
Acosta’s in Kupang City looking at
coring equipment.
The sales pitch shifts, Kupang City. Special coring equipment.
BURNS
(into phone)
Coring rigs will come from Kupang
City. I’ll put you down for 20. Two
shares. You got it.
WELLS
(into phone)
You’re magic.
And as WE LOOK over this makeshift trading floor in full
action, the SOUND OF KEYS BEING PUNCHED rises above the din of
sales chatter -- TAPE PRINTOUT SCROLLING, and WE ARE...
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT
Bobby Burns bangs figures into an ADDING MACHINE. Wells
circles. It’s been a long day, everyone’s exhausted. Burns
scrolls the tape, tears it off with a flourish. Passes it to
Wells, who reads, swallows hard, then delivers the number.
WELLS
(into phone)
Two hundred sixty seven thousand, four
hundred and thirty-four dollars.
Over the phone, there’s SILENCE.
EXT. MINING SUPPLY - KUPANG CITY, INDONESIA - DAY
Acosta checks out new equipment while on a portable phone -ACOSTA
(into phone)
Not exactly the number I had in mind.
Realize Acosta is now looking at the USED EQUIPMENT YARD.
EXT. USED EQUIPMENT YARD - KUPANG CITY - DAY
Acosta stands looking up at rusting industrial dinosaurs
against the endless blue sky.
WELLS (O.S.)
I might be able to borrow a little bit
against it.
(beat)
(MORE)

31.
WELLS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
No. Truth. That’s it for now. Can you
make it work?
ACOSTA
That’ll get us the permit, a few
holes. If we work fast and get lucky,
who knows...
WELLS
Get us a little good news and we’ll
raise more money.
Suddenly hear some DUDES AT A FOOSBALL TABLE loudly ARGUING
over PAC-10 football, drowning out Wells.
ACOSTA
You work out of a bar, Wells?
WELLS
Keeping a lid on expenses, Mike.
Makin’ the dollar holler.
Acosta hanging up, wondering just what he’s gotten himself
into. He examines a well-used drill, speaks Bahasa with the
mining equipment salesman, haggling.
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
A suitcase on the bed. Wells sorta packing, a haphazard
undertaking under the best of circumstances. He takes a drink.
Surveys the possibilities.
WELLS
Which tie? This one or this one?
Reveal Kay behind him, drink in hand.
KAY
I want my watch back.
WELLS
First off, it’s your mother’s and
second you’re gonna get it back.
KAY
It was my mother’s until she gave it
to me.

32-32A.
WELLS
I gotta bring my good shoes, where are
my good shoes?
KAY
Look under the bed. I don’t like to
see my stuff up in pawns, Kenny. You
know I’m sensitive to it.
He gets down to look under the bed. See his ass sticking out.
WELLS
We always talk about our dreams, about
the ranch, clean air, big views, our
place above it all. That’s what I’m
doin’, getting us out of this shitbox.
KAY
I don’t mind this shitbox.
He’s back up with the shoes.
WELLS
See, right there, that’s what I love -you’re like one of those booster
rockets that helps us get up to the
stars.
Stands back with the shoes. He wiggles the shoes.
Too much?

WELLS (CONT’D)

KAY
What the fuck, Kenny?
KAY (CONT’D)
We figure shit out together, Kenny.
Through thick and fuckin’ thin. If you
needed my watch, I’d give it to you.
WELLS
I know, babe. I’ll be back soon, I
promise.
He starts off... Then pauses like he remembers one last thing.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Oh, here -- why don’t you time me?
He dangles her mother’s watch. Turns, smiling. She smiles,
too. Love rushes in, overflows.

32-32AA.
KAY
Wear the blue tie. It brings out your
eyes.

33.
As we PRE-LAP a CALL TO PRAYER -EXT. JAKARTA, INDONESIA - DAWN
Crossing river traffic reveals a luxury hotel amid minarets.
Super: JAKARTA, INDONESIA
INT. JAKARTA PALACE HOTEL SUITE - DAY
Acosta goes over paperwork, shaved, hair groomed, transformed.
Wells, adjusting his blue tie, comes out of the bathroom.
ACOSTA
What’s that smell?
WELLS
I dropped a goose.

33A.
ACOSTA
And are you wearing cologne?
WELLS
Yeah, why? You getting turned on?

34.
ACOSTA
Listen to me: we have one shot at
this. He’s the Minister of The
Interior of Indonesia. If he doesn't
like us for any reason, we’re done.
Never put your hands on your hips.
Crossing your arms is considered
aggressive. And cologne, here, is an
insult.
WELLS
You get a whiff of some of the folks
around here? I might suggest changing
the national cologne policy.
ACOSTA
We get the deal. We don’t insult. We
don’t talk. We listen, we get our
permit and we get out. Are we clear?
WELLS
...yeah. Got it.
ACOSTA
Now go wash it off.
Wells stands there for a moment like a humiliated child. Then
goes back into the bathroom. Off Acosta, WE GO:
INT. JAKARTA PALACE RESTAURANT - DAY
A formal room with a Chinese theme. Seated at the table is the
MINISTER OF MINING. A cadre of security and yes-men flanking.
The Minister speaks with a cultured Indonesian accent.
MINISTER
...I have reviewed your permit request
for the Kensana property...
As a waiter pours hot liquid into small bowls at each setting,
we find Wells perspiring in his bad suit. He picks up his bowl
and starts to sip his “tea.” Acosta clears his throat -- Wells
sees the Minister dipping his fingers into his bowl.
MINISTER (CONT’D)
(to Acosta)
There is a conspicuous lack of
documentation.
WELLS
Hey, we’ve got the paperwork -The Minister ignores him as Acosta jumps in.

34aA.
ACOSTA
Yes, excellency. We have reports from
previous attempts, but judged it best
not to waste your valuable time.
The Minister accepts this, but still ignores Wells.
MINISTER
(beat, to Acosta)
What makes you think you will find
what others before you could not?
ACOSTA
They were looking in the wrong place.
The underlying geology is sound.
GIANT PRAWNS are placed in front of them. Wells can’t help it--

34A.
WELLS
Hey, can I get a fork?
The waiters don’t move. Acosta and the Minister ignore Wells.

35.
ACOSTA
There’s gold there, Excellency. And
with your blessing, we will find it.
A long beat. Wells gets uncomfortable. Realizes his arms are
crossed. Uncrosses them. And sells.
WELLS
Mike really knows his stuff. There’s
no one better...
The Minister doesn’t even look at Wells, addressing Acosta.
MINISTER
As you know, our natural resources are
a divine inheritance of all the
people.
ACOSTA
As is your capable stewardship,
Excellency.
MINISTER
A heavy responsibility to be sure.
Wells fidgets, then barks to a waiter -WELLS
Hey! Who’s a guy gotta bang to get a
drink around here?
Wells definitely has the Minister’s attention now.
MINISTER
I am a Muslim, sir. I do not drink.
WELLS
I’m an American and I do. And last
time I checked, I’m hosting this
little shindig, so you might want to
at least acknowledge I’m sitting here.
MINISTER
You are most definitely an American.
WELLS
What’s that mean?
MINISTER
It’s the belief that paying for lunch
is a substitute for manners.

36.
WELLS
You’re right. And I apologize. I can
see I’ve offended your delicate moral
sensibilities. But I may have just the
thing to help you get over it.
And with that, he pulls out a THICK WAD OF CASH from his
jacket, sets it down on the lazy Susan with a THUD. And then
spins it -- the cash rotates around the large table toward the
Minister. The Minister stares at Wells with contempt.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Now that you mention it, I’ve been
thinking of converting to Muslim.
ACOSTA
That’s enough.
WELLS
Even if we don’t find any gold, at
least I still get the forty virgins-Wells --!

ACOSTA

WELLS
I’m not greedy. I’ll go half--twenty’s
a windfall. Hell, if they’re really
virgins, two would probably kill me.
The cash slowly stops revolving. The Minister never looks at
it. He stands, throws down his napkin, and, entourage in tow,
sweeps imperiously from the restaurant.
Acosta looks at Wells, his anger and disbelief palpable. Then
he grabs up the cash and goes. Wells is alone, his face
flushed with embarrassment. He sees a patron staring at him.
WELLS (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you looking at?
Wells pours himself a cup of tea, hand shaking as he drinks.
Then he looks up and sees Acosta coming back. Wells stands,
about to apologize, but before he can speak -- CRACK!
Acosta decks him. Wells falls backwards over the chair,
hitting the floor. He looks up at Acosta standing over him
and, in a flash, recognizes just how much this matters to him,
that much of his poise is a kind of cover.
WELLS (CONT’D)
You gonna tell me what happened?
Wells gets up, brushing himself off. Acosta takes his time.

37.
WELLS (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.
ACOSTA
He took the money.
A smile spreads across Wells's face.
WELLS
Of course he took the money.
money.

It’s

EXT. KENSANA VALLEY - DAY
INFINITE JUNGLE in an anamorphic frame. Every leaf and blade
of grass swaying in the wind. Then Acosta appears. This is
Wells’s POV. He hurries to stay close.
ACOSTA stops moving. He looks at Wells. He looks down. Wells
approaches cautiously and also looks down. Acosta makes an X
in the soil.
Now reveal a small army of NATIVE WORKERS waiting. A FOREMAN
shrieks and they break into motion... clearing the “giant’s
footstep” for the first drill position at the “Washoe site.”
The sky is blue, dotted with white clouds; the river sparkles
gold surrounded by the limestone cliffs.
Tight shots of assembly, metal to metal. Acosta busy. Wells,
in his Loman suit slapping at Mosquitos, jungle pressing in.
EXT. WASHOE SITE - VARIOUS - DAY
A METAL SCAFFOLD lyrically sways above the grass, framed
against the limestone cliffs. A break in the grass suddenly
reveals a WATER BUFFALO pulling the first drill.
The drill is positioned. Jungle has been beaten back.
A GIRL leads a goat out of a watchful crowd to the drill where
a Dayak “BORETN” waits. He murmurs prayers in his language.
Then pulls a knife and, without hesitation or sentimentality,
draws it across the goat’s neck -AN ARM YANKS THE PULL-CORD on the drill, ROARING to life -Panning NATIVE FACES to find WELLS as a gentle SUN SHOWER
begins to rain down.

38.
WELLS
See, ahh... That’s beautiful! The sky
is blessing us.
Acosta stares up at the sky with a different perspective.
ACOSTA
Monsoon’s coming early.
Monsoon?

WELLS

CRACK! FLASHES OF LIGHTING. Wells's face realizing the
seriousness. THUNDER RUMBLES. Rain falls harder. The DRILL
SPINS down into the earth...
INT. MAIN TENT - NIGHT
Vinyl spinning on a record player. Something lofty, obscure.
WELLS
A record player? Am I paying for that?
But you can tell the whole thing makes Wells happy. He’s got a
whiskey. The native foreman is there. And through the flaps
two distant drills glow under colored tarpaulins.
ACOSTA
(re: the map)
We’re here. And now we step out in a
semi-circular pattern. Six man crews,
twelve hour shifts, around the clock.
Tomorrow I’ll start looking at core
samples. We’ll send the most promising
down river to the assay lab. When we
get a hit we’ll drop holes to chart
the contour of the vein.
EXT. WASHOE SITE - VARIOUS - DAY
Three foot ROCK CORES laid out in a wooden box... Pull back to
reveal ten boxes... then twenty... Moving INSIDE -THE CORE SHED
Where a CIRCULAR SAW cuts a CORE. Wells watching Acosta
examine a section, then toss it in a ROCK CRUSHER... The
RUBBLE is then bagged in canvas sacks... which are closed and
sealed with HOT WAX... and finally stamped with a WASHOE LOGO.
THE CORE SAMPLES are carried in a long line through the valley
toward the river -- an Indonesian Salgado come to life.
Wells and Acosta watch, all hopes and dreams in that line.

39.
WELLS
What do we do now?
CAMERA RISES UP from the workers carrying the core samples to
the limestone cliffs and endless sky.
ACOSTA (O.S.)
We wait. And we keep drilling.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MAIN TENT - DUSK
Wells sprays himself liberally in bug spray, making a cloud
under the light. Almost immediately a bug bites his shoulder.
WELLS
These bugs don’t give a fuck about
this bug spray.
AT THE CAMP STOVE
Wells, spatula in hand, watches mystery meat sizzle. He cooks
and talks over his shoulder to Acosta who is working.
WELLS (CONT’D)
The guy who invented the hamburger was
smart. But the guy who invented the
cheeseburger... Genius.
He begins serving them up.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Don’t ask where this meat came from.
IT’S LATER
They’re both relaxing. Wells maybe a bit more relaxed.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Goddamn jungle. Nothing for 200 miles
and look at us. Not so bad.
Acosta takes in the night. Raises his cup in a salute to the
dark jungle all around. They both drink.
ACOSTA
What’s the meaning of the tattoo?
WELLS
It’s from a poem I read as a kid:
(Acosta waits)
The bird with no feet sleeps on the
wind.

39aA.
ACOSTA
You’re full of mysteries, Wells. You
really are.
WELLS
You got any tattoos, Mike?
ACOSTA
Only on the inside.
Wells looks at him a beat, then looks out into the dark. The
sounds of drilling drift across the valley floor.
OMIT
DISSOLVE TO:
And a LONE MESSENGER running up the trail...
EXT. WASHOE SITE - DAYS LATER
Wells meets him halfway, takes the ASSAY REPORT and tears it
open, reading. Even from a distance we can tell it’s bad news.
A DRILL IS MOVED to a NEW POSITION. DRILL 2 IS MOVED. CORES
ARE CRUSHED and BAGGED. A CANOE LOADED WITH CORE SAMPLES
motors away down the rising river. The rain is torrential. The
MAIN TENT looks like it’s about to float away. Acosta meeting
Obb... Wells meeting him... Acosta...
INT. WASHOE SITE - MAIN TENT - CONTINUOUS
Acosta and Wells, back to back, working. Acosta thinking about
geology, Wells looking at financials. Realize neither one is
looking at an unopened report on the table. Finally Acosta
tears it open, reads it. Passes it to Wells: INDO-KARTA
LABORATORIES - ASSAY REPORT.
WELLS
...These things look worse every time
we get one.
Acosta stares steadily at his map, which shows an increasingly
desperate spray of holes.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Thirty, 100 meter holes, Mike. Thirty.
And what do we got? We got shit.
ACOSTA
Remember what I told you about
patience?

39aB.
WELLS
Remember what I told you about money?
ACOSTA
Yeah, it wasn’t a problem.

39A.
Looks at the numbers. They don’t lie.
WELLS
It’s a problem now.
ACOSTA
I’ll try something else. Move further
up the seam. Drop 80 meter holes. Move
faster.

40.

Do it.

WELLS

Wells suddenly shudders with a chill. Acosta looks at him.
I’m fine.

WELLS (CONT’D)

ACOSTA
You don’t look so good.
WELLS
It’s ninety-eight degrees out and
pissing rain. And all we’re pulling up
is dinosaur shit. How am I supposed to
look?
(beat)
Jesus, I’m freezing.
Wells starts to shake. Acosta puts a hand to Wells's head.
ACOSTA
You’re burning up.
WELLS
I’m fine.
(off Acosta’s concern)
I said, I’m fine.
Wells forces himself to stand. He moves to Acosta's maps.
WELLS (CONT’D)
All right, where do we go next?
But Wells has to sit. Off Acosta's concerned look WE GO...
EXT. WASHOE SITE - DAY
That fucking rain. WORKERS, meager items held in plastic bags,
assemble in their tent. The FOREMAN speaks to his men.
WELLS (V.O)
We drilled our holes, assayed the
cores and got nothing. Zero. We were
nearly busted, out of money, out of
time. Workers quitting. But, no way I
was giving up, I was gonna find a way
to keep going if it killed me.

41.
One RIG IS SILENT. Wells struggles across the compound through
the downpour to stop the men from leaving. He falls. Picks
himself up. Waves his arms. Yells in a language they don’t
speak. Even the buffalo is leaving. He slips again -WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
I picked up a bad case of malaria,
which takes out something like a
million people a year... And I was on
the list.
From the mud he sees the workers vanishing, a skeleton crew on
the remaining rig. He rolls on his back. And still the rain
comes down.
INT. MAIN TENT - RAINY DUSK
Acosta enters. Doesn’t realize Wells is slumped in a chair in
the gloom.
WELLS
The workers are leaving, Mike.
ACOSTA
I know. I’ve got the new assay
reports.
Acosta lights a lantern, sees Wells.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Jesus. Get your ass in bed already.
It’s an effort for Wells to speak, painful.
WELLS
Talk to me.
ACOSTA
There’s nothing to talk about. We’re
not finding anything.
Wells sags. The reality that he’s losing again sinking in.
Wells has another fit of chills. He’s half-delirious.
WELLS
Maybe we’re pushing them too hard.
Maybe we should take it easy, enjoy it
a little bit.
ACOSTA
Take it easy? Is that a Reno bumper
sticker? The losers’ credo.

42.
WELLS
Nah, man, it’s just life. Sometimes
you just gotta take it easy... I’m
freezing.
Acosta helps him to his cot. Pulls the thin blanket over.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Maybe cut ‘em all in... offer
ownership, share in the upside...
The DISTANT WHINE of the last drill suddenly GOES QUIET. The
TIMELESS CACOPHONY of the jungle RISES.
WELLS (CONT’D)
I’m scared, Mike. Don’t let me die out
here for nothing...
Wells passes out into a feverish sleep. Acosta watches him a
long time before reaching a decision.
EXT. MAIN TENT - DAWN
Acosta steps into the empty, silent camp. Rain curtaining off
his hat. He sets out alone.
EXT. LONGHOUSE VILLAGE - LATER
Acosta walking through the rainy jungle toward a village. See
natives in the limestone cliffs looking down. Acosta passes a
pond where people bathe and fill jugs with muddy water.
AT THE LONGHOUSE there are DAYAK WOMEN on the porch. Acosta
has a few quiet words. One slowly stands, disappears through
the DARK OPENING. Acosta cannot see inside. It’s too dark. The
remaining women look at him evenly. The “FOREMAN” appears,
obviously a LOCAL CHIEF.
ACOSTA
(Dayak)
What can I do to get you to return to
work? We are running out of money,
it’s true. But we’re close. I know it.
A beat as the foreman considers Acosta. Then he gestures to
follow. The rising CRIES of a child can be heard.
INT. THATCH HUT - DAY
Thrumming rain on the thatch and in half-gloom find a feverish
CHILD. Acosta watches as the mother tries to get him to take a
sip of water. Acosta kneels and passes his canteen to the
mother. Urges her to pour clean water.

43.
WELLS (V.O.)
He realized what they needed wasn’t
stock options, but drinking water and
antibiotics. And damned if he didn’t
go to every little place every one of
our people came from. Streams that had
no name. All feeding the great Kensana
river.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY
A skeptical Jennings observes Wells a moment.
JENNINGS
And you believe this was sincere?
WELLS
Absolutely. Mike’s half a native
anyway. He was trying everything. And
I was a mess. Malaria is no joke.
INT. MAIN TENT - DAY
The monsoon continues, but Wells is oblivious, a shuddering
chill wracking his body. Acosta watches this uneasily.
ACOSTA
We need to get you out of here. I’m
pulling the plug.
WELLS
Not happening. Tell me the plan.
ACOSTA
What they need... they need clean
water, antibiotics...
(reluctant)
If we get filter systems up here, I
think they’ll come back.
Wells looks up with dim eyes, a smile crossing his face.
WELLS
I’ve got maybe eighteen hundred
dollars of room left on the Visa. Five
hundred on Diner’s Club. Use it all.
Wells hot and dry. Acosta looks down at him. He doesn’t think
Wells is gonna make it. He’s seen it before.
EXT. SMALL CREEK - DAY
A break in the rain. Misty clouds circle limestone mountains.

43A.
Brown water in a micro filter as Acosta hangs it from a
branch. Clear water flows out a hose. A child tastes the clean
water, doesn’t like it. Several children laugh.
In the river a mother sits with her baby on her lap.

44.
As Acosta fills ANOTHER FILTER, reveal NATIVES finding gold up
the stream. It almost mocks Acosta.
INT. MAIN TENT - DAY
THE SAME LIMESTONE CLIFFS... ONLY NOW WE TILT DOWN and FIND
RENO, GAUDY NEON NESTLED IN GREEN JUNGLE. CASINO SOUNDS AND
NOISES MIXED WITH JUNGLE.
Wells tossing and turning on the cot having his fever dreams.
WELLS (V.O)
I spent the next few weeks in a
malarial haze. I should have been
dead. The workers stayed. Mike kept it
all going. And he kept me alive.
EXT. SMALL CREEK - DAY
Acosta in the rain, turns and sees something that stops him -WELLS (V.O.)
Did he manage to enjoy himself a
little bit along the way..?
A BEAUTIFUL NATIVE GIRL stares at Acosta through the rain.
It’s like they know each other.
WELLS (V.O.
How should I know? I was delirious. I
do not recommend Malaria treated with
a bunch of leaves.
INT. MAIN TENT - DAY
Rain. And the sound of an IGNITING FLAME... FUMMM --! A BUTANE
FLAME. And Wells in and out of consciousness to find a BORETN
in their tent brewing a potion of herbs as Acosta watches.
WELLS
What is that?
ACOSTA
No idea. But they say it works.
WELLS
They don’t have electricity. Or socks.
The Boretn brings a bamboo mug toward Wells.
ACOSTA
Come on, get it down.

45.
Wells chokes down the remedy.
EXT. WASHOE SITE - VARIOUS - DAY
Limestone cliffs and mist. Drills spinning, biting into earth.
Clouds passing overhead. Men feeding pipe to the machine.
Wells drenched in sweat, looking like death -ACOSTA and FOREMAN load CORE SAMPLES onto a boat.
DRILLS SPINNING, biting into the earth/WELLS TOSSING, TURNING,
drenched as the FEVER FINALLY BREAKS.
Obb brings another report. Acosta reads, betraying no emotion.
FEVER DREAM: A RAFT FLOATING ON A GOLDEN RIVER... We’re
drifting toward it as it goes around a bend... SOMETHING on
it... a BODY.. FUNERAL BIER. Closer... closer... it’s WELLS -INT. MAIN TENT - DAY
WELLS COMES TO -- surprised to be alive. Surprised it’s not
raining. Realizes Acosta is right there looking at him.
WELLS
What day is it?
No idea.
Month?
August.

ACOSTA
WELLS
ACOSTA

See this is a different month than Wells expected.
WELLS
You been sitting here this whole time?
ACOSTA
Let’s not get carried away.
Wells now realizes Acosta has an assay report.
WELLS
You gonna talk, or what?
ACOSTA
We pulled seventeen more cores.
He looks at Wells, unreadable.

45A.
WELLS
What? What do they say? No good?

46.
ACOSTA
Not good...
Wells falls back. Acosta stands, a completely different look
on his face, one of wonder -ACOSTA (CONT’D)
More in the vicinity of great.
Wells looks up. A face that’s almost afraid to hope.
WELLS
Don’t mess around, Mike.
ACOSTA
Eighth of an ounce per ton.
Wells scans the reports, rising to his feet.
WELLS
Eighth of an ounce per... WHAT!!??
Acosta smiles -- Wells is in shock.
ACOSTA
We’ve got a strike, Kenny.
Wells smiles, laughs, screams!
WELLS
We’ve got ourselves a gold mine!
ACOSTA
That we do.
Wells struggles up to his feet and joins Acosta best he can in
jumping up and down.
WELLS
WE GOT A GOLD MINE..! WE GOT A GOLD
MINE..!
CAMERA DRIFTS outside to meet Wells who appears through the
doorway as he YELLS TO THE HILLS -WELLS (CONT’D)
WE GOT A GODDAMN GOLD MINE --!!!
Which ECHOES back to him from the cliffs -WELLS ECHO
WE GOT A GODDAMN GOLD MINE MINE MINE!!
SMASH TO:

47.
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT
POP!!! Gold-leafed bottles in buckets. Champagne sprays from
the bottle as Wells moves through the crowd at the bar,
filling everyone’s glasses.
WELLS (V.O)
That moment, there’s no way I could
possibly describe the feeling.
The regulars are all here, sharing in Wells's victory.
WELLS (V.O) (CONT’D)
It’s amazing how a little gold dust
can change everything. For better or
worse, the ride had begun. And what a
goddamn ride...
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - LATER
The place is vibrating! MUSIC OVER. Wells is with Bobby Burns
and Connie and Nevins celebrating at the bar. Kay passing out
a round of drinks, the last one to Wells.
Kenny looks at Kay; Kay looks at Kenny, deep into each other,
a small moment of private understanding in passing that says
it all. Then he turns to his guys:
WELLS
To the best team in the business!
CONNIE
You’re a stand up guy, Kenny.
NEVINS
To sharing the wealth.
WELLS
To the mother lode!
They clink glasses and drink deeply, ”To the mother lode!”
INT./EXT. CADDY ELDORADO - SCENIC COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Kenny and Kay driving into the hills on a perfect afternoon.
Fun and carefree, windows down, 70’s music on the radio.
KENNY
Smell that? Smell that air? Mountain
air. It’s a tonic.
KAY
Ah, so good. So good.

47A.
They’re singing along. Passing small family ranches.
KAY (CONT’D)
Remember I told you Janice got
promoted to run Truckee?
WELLS
Mmm hmm. Good for her.
KAY
Well, Carl asked me if I’d like to be
considered to take her place.
Assistant Manager position.
Outside the car as they go zipping past, music trailing, a
GHOST TOWN, faded signs and abandoned buildings... A dangling
sign reads, “MAGGIE’S CREEK... Pop -- “0” in spray paint.
WELLS
That’s great, babe.
KAY
Everything’s working out so great.

48.
By way of agreement he rubs her thigh where the dress has
ridden up. Sunlight filters through the trees above. Kay’s
toes are painted eggshell blue.
WELLS
You’re gonna be able to quit all of it
if you want... Never work another day
in your life. Blue skies coming.
INT. ELDORADO - MAGIC HOUR
WELLS
Close your eyes.
Wells drives down a country lane.
EXT. ELDORADO - DAY
Wells stops, gets out and starts around the car.
KAY
(happy)
Kenny Wells, what are you doing?
WELLS
Eyes closed. No peeking.
He opens Kay’s door, leads her a short distance.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Okay, now open ‘em.
She opens her eyes. In her eyes something immense that must be
comprehended. And for a moment we don’t see what she’s seeing
and then we do:
DREAM RANCH LAND
The sweep of ranch land is epic. Prairie dogs hop away. Elk in
the distance the size of ants.
KAY
It’s beautiful.
WELLS
It’s going to be our place, above it
all, away from it all. Like we always
wanted. We’ll put the house here.
(MORE)

49.
WELLS (CONT'D)
Fieldstone and oak. The kind that
lasts forever. A big kitchen where I’m
standing. And a great room with two
fireplaces.
He turns to look at Kay, to see if she’s going with it.
KAY
Can we afford this?
WELLS
Almost, baby. Almost...
Wells jogs a short distance away, still going...
WELLS (CONT’D)
Bedrooms here and here and here... And
here... For the kids. Ah, come on,
Kay... How many kids?
KAY
People usually start with one.
They look at each other. It’s golden hour. Then she skips
through the field toward him.
KAY (CONT’D)
Kitchen should go the other way,
Kenny. To get the morning light.
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT
Wells laying it out for the boys: Burns, Connie, and Nevins.
WELLS
It’ll be straight commission to
start, but this hook’s got meat on
it. There’s money out there, so reel
it in.
They throw back the rest of what’s in their glasses. Wells
leans over and whispers to Bobby Burns.
WELLS (CONT’D)
This stock’s gonna start cooking. You
sell a little here and there. Don’t
wait. Think rainy day, Bobby boy.
EXT. DREAM RANCH LAND - DUSK
The car doors are open, a great SONG plays on the radio. Wells
and Kay slow dance in the field as a glorious sunset fades.

50.
And PULLING BACK to find a BILLBOARD ON STILTS showing a
“dream house.” As Kay and Wells slowly turn in the distance
and the music is gently blown away across the fields.
INT. THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT
Wells and Kay dancing in that way happy couples do, almost
like they’re one person, her head melting against his chest.
BURNS (O.S.)
Kenny... this is Walt Kealer. He
publishes “The Gold Digger.”
KEALER
We reach a half a million readers and
they’d all love to know what you got
cooking over there in Indonesia. You
have a minute, I’ll buy you a drink.
Kealer, a serious guy, and Burns both look at Kay.
KAY
(almost a whisper)
No one dances like you.
(to the world)
He’s all yours, Walt.
WELLS
Hell, I read the Gold Digger. Step
over to my office, Walt.
Wells signals for two drinks, leads Kealer to the booth.
KEALER
They’re saying you bring this in,
you’ll get the Golden Pickaxe. What do
you say about that?
WELLS
I say we probably just jinxed it.
KEALER
How many ounces you guessing?
WELLS
Millions of ounces, Walt. Millions.
Kealer whistles. Makes a note.

50A.
KEALER
Placer mining?
WELLS
Hard rock. It ain’t amateur hour.
KEALER
How’s the infrastructure?

51.
WELLS
Building it from the ground up.
Wells sees Kay at the bar flirting/teasing with two regulars.
Queen of the runway. He loves this.
AT THE BAR
Kay waits for Roy to mix fresh drinks.
ROY
(nodding at Wells)
Seems like someone’s ship is finally
coming in.
KAY
Everyone’s, Roy.
(so proud)
He makes shit happen. He really does.
A customer sidles up and wraps a big arm around. Kay flashes
some wattage -KAY (CONT’D)
JD, where you been hidin’ yourself?
BACK WITH WELLS -KEALER
On a different tack, what do you think
your dad would say if he could see you
right now?
WELLS
The last card you turn over is the one
that matters.
INT. COLEMAN & MEAD CAPITAL GROUP - CLIVE’S OFFICE - DAY
CLIVE Coleman, 70’s, flanked by a now-deferential Andrews and
Stanton, opposite Wells.
CLIVE
Kenny, your father and I started out
together in this business. Hell, he
put me in the business, but I don’t
have to tell you that.
WELLS
Dad always spoke well of you, Clive.
CLIVE
One of the best men I ever knew.

51aA.
The mention of his father in this context makes Wells proud.
CLIVE (CONT’D)
You’ve gone from 4 to 23 cents on the
first assay result. And you’ve pulled
two more that confirmed those
findings?

51A.
WELLS
Three more.
CLIVE
Three more... I’d like to underwrite a
private placement of Washoe stock. I
believe we can raise between eight and
ten million dollars.
WELLS
Capital’s definitely top of the agenda
right now.
CLIVE
A lot of folks will want to make this
deal, but we’ve got history and I hope
you know you can trust me. I only wish
you’d brought it to me sooner. I could
have helped you from the get-go.

52.
Wells’ gaze now slides to Stanton, a deer in headlights. Wells
pushes his coffee mug across the table.
WELLS
Top that off for me, will you?
Stanton rises and exits with Wells’s mug. WE FOLLOW HIM -INT. COLEMAN & MEAD CAPITAL GROUP - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Stanton walks to the kitchenette. A COWORKER looks at him like
a condemned man. Hear LAUGHTER from the conference room. He
pours the coffee, takes a deep breath, and heads back.
INT. COLEMAN & MEAD CAPITAL GROUP - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Stanton comes back in to find the group on their feet, Wells
shaking hands with Clive Coleman.
CLIVE
Stanton. Mr. Wells has agreed to give
us his business. On one condition.
Stanton blanches.

Here it comes. Wells is stone-faced.

WELLS
I want you to personally handle my
account. I need you to be available
to me 24-7 and 365.
Stanton is speechless for just a moment, but finds his voice.
STANTON
Absolutely. Yes. Thank you.
Clive slaps the stunned Stanton on the shoulder.
CLIVE
Congratulations. Seems you made quite
an impression.
A look between Wells and Stanton, a look of understanding.
Stanton is grateful, but also knows that Wells owns him.
WELLS
It’s gonna be a wild-ass ride. You
ready for that?

53.

Yes, sir.

STANTON

WELLS
Then what are we standing here for?
Let’s go make some money.
SEQUENCE --- THE WASHOE SITE -- the noise is staggering as ACOSTA
supervises more core drilling. FOUR DRILLS now working,
CONVERGING as they MAP THE CONTOURS of the vein.
-- THE ASSAY LAB -- a Washoe sack is cut open, the crushed
rock core sample is poured onto an industrial scale.
-- THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR -- Wells, Bobby Burns and the guys
work the phones. Kay brings Wells another Seagrams. He gives
her a smile, never missing a beat of his pitch.
-- STOCK TICKER -- Washoe climbs...$2.75...$3.10...$4.87...
Kenny.

ACOSTA (V.O.)
You check the last report?

WELLS (V.O.)
I’m looking at it now... Holy shit...
HOLY SHIT!
-- VIEW THROUGH A MICROSCOPE -- and there it is, scattered
among the base rock -- GOLD! Flecks of it, but there’s
something preternatural about the way it glitters, and at this
magnification, it is mesmerizing.
ACOSTA (V.O.)
Holy shit is right, my friend.
Whoooow!!!

WELLS (V.O.)

INT./EXT. NEW WASHOE OFFICES MONTAGE - DAY
-- A RENO OFFICE BUILDING catching morning sun. WASHOE MINING
PLAQUE slides into the lobby list of tenants. REVERSE to WELLS
watching, THE BOYS behind holding boxes of stuff.
-- ELEVATORS OPEN. WASHOE SIGN FIRST THING YOU SEE. The boys
all swoop in and fan out and get to work.
-- TWELVE PACKS go in the fridge. Folding tables opened.
Phones pulled out of boxes, wires snakes across the floor.
-- A FAX MACHINE begins slowly ticking out a fax: WASHOE TEAM
HEADED BY GEOLOGIST MIKE ACOSTA...

54.
-- BOOZE BOTTLES ONTO GLASS SHELVES... and we’re in Wells’s
corner office. He and Kay overseeing something. Whip to a
STUFFED ELK, evidence of the Greenhorns, now on the wall.
WELLS
Damn nice of Roy to loan us that Elk.
She pushes him backwards by his chest until he’s sitting new
desk chair. She straddles him. Corner windows. View of Reno.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Kay, do you want to work here? Quit
all those other jobs?
She looks at him.
KAY
You be the prospector, Mr. Wells. I’ll
be the barmaid who got swept off her
feet.
He spins his chair. Around and around they go -WELLS
I love you, Kay.
KAY
You better.
-- CAMERA RACES ACROSS THE FLOOR TO FIND THE FAX IS FINISHED.
CONNIE TEARS IT OFF AND READS IT: ”UPDATES ESTIMATE ON
INDONESIAN MINE -- KENSANA TO YIELD IN EXCESS OF 10 MILLION
OUNCES!” Connie stares in disbelief.
CONNIE
We’re gonna be so fucking rich.
CROSS CUT TO:
-- A COMPUTER SCREEN -- WASHOE’S FINANCIALS displayed in
GRAPHS and CHARTS. WASHOE’S SHARE PRICE is listed at $6.26.
Pull back to reveal WE ARE in -INT. BROWN, THOMAS - TRADING FLOOR - NEW YORK - DAY
A young banker, BRIAN WOOLF (30’s), scans the info on his
screen. He hits print and strides across the trading floor.
He barely breaks stride as he passes the PRINTER, grabbing the
freshly printed documents and we go...
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - HOLLIS DRESHER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
50th Floor. Breathtaking Manhattan views. We are suddenly a
long, long way from Reno. A file on a desk: IDEAS FOR HOLLIS.

55.
INSIDE -- RECOMMENDATION: WASHOE MINING LTD. STRENGTH OF
CONVICTION -- HIGH.
Woolf stands before HOLLIS DRESHER (50’s), impeccable in
bespoke, as Dresher looks over the newly printed documents.
DRESHER
Who are they?
WOOLF
Wildcatters basically. This
Acosta had some success before.
Copper. Got taken over by
Freeport Mac. It’s all in there.
Dresher takes a moment before looking up from the documents.
DRESHER
I like this. Bring them in. Let’s have
a closer look.
INT. WASHOE OFFICES - “CONFERENCE ROOM” - DAY
A folding table in Kenny’s office. Wells is with Bobby Burns,
Connie Wright and Stanton... a Washoe board meeting.
STANTON
We’re about fifty percent allocated
right now. And we want to set aside
thirty of the remaining fifty for you
boys to unload.
They love this idea. It’s low-hanging fruit at this point.
WELLS
Hold that thought. I gotta bleed the
beast.
As soon as he’s gone, the phone RINGS. They all stare at it.
Kay!!

BOBBY/CONNIE/NEVINS

Through the doorway, passing, without missing a beat -KAY
(into phone)
Good morning, Washoe Mining. How may I
direct your call.
(beat)
Please hold.
She covers the mouthpiece, then realizes they actually have a
hold button. Which she presses.

56.
KAY (CONT’D)
Kenny! You got a call!
Wells emerges from the executive head. They all watch him pick
up the receiver. Press the button.
WELLS
This is Kenny Wells.
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - DRESHER’S OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY
Woolf, looking over the skyline.
WOOLF
Mr. Wells. This is Bryan Woolf of
Brown, Thomas, in New York.
No shit.

WELLS (V.O.)

INT. WASHOE OFFICES - DAY
Wells is listening, starting to fidget nervously.
WELLS
(into phone)
Wait. Really? ...
(covering phone)
Bryan Woolf, mineral group at Brown,
Thomas in NYC.
STANTON
(impressed)
Brown, Thomas. Wow.
WELLS
(into phone)
Okay. Okay... I look forward to it.
Wells slowly hangs up. Everyone looking, what just happened?
Then, Wells calling out -WELLS (CONT’D)
Kay, they’re flying me out!
Everyone feeling a bit of awe and excitement. Kay’s smile is
painted there like a barmaid Mona Lisa.

57.
EXT. THE SEAGRAMS BUILDING - DAY
The Seagrams building, solid as the booze that built it. And
at the base, Wells staring up. As Acosta looks him over.
ACOSTA
Wells. Wells--!
WELLS
I truly had no idea there was a
Seagrams building. Like the Vatican.
ACOSTA
Wells! Where’d you get the tie?
Wells looks down at the tie.
WELLS
Airport. Forty bucks. Don’t like it?
Acosta snaps off the tag still hanging from the loop.
You ready?

ACOSTA

WELLS
Who you talking to, Mikey?
But Wells’s eye is caught by some WALL STREET HONCHOS,
composed, confident, effortless, heading to a meeting.
Wells!

ACOSTA

WELLS
Stop saying my name. Are you ready?
Wells pulls his gaze back. They look at each other. Neither
one is ready.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Shit. We’re all just selling used
cars.
Wells brushes by confidently. AND WE GO:

58.
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Woolf, Dresher and others in THE MINERAL GROUP. In this
rarefied air, Wells looks out of his depth -WELLS
We’ve got a private placement in play
right now that’s over fifty percent
subscribed! And that’s off our current
assays. The numbers keep coming in
good, and they will, sky’s the limit
on this thing.
Woolf steps up, he’s sophisticated, confident.
WOOLF
You don’t need to sell us, Mr.
Wells. We’ve done the math and we
believe you’re sitting on the
largest gold find of the decade. At
Brown, Thomas we have a history of
helping guide people such as
yourself through what are sometimes
complicated waters.
WELLS
Complicated how?
WOOLF
That delicate balance, Mr. Wells,
between being asset rich and cash
poor. The important thing is we
believe you can go all the way and we
want to help you get there.
Wells loves this. Woolf has said exactly the right thing, but
you also get the feeling he has done this many times before.
WOOLF (CONT’D)
We’ll need big money onboard, of
course, investment banks, mutual fund
managers, pension fund administrators.
We have the team and the relationships
to introduce you to this world.
WELLS
We’ve done all right up to now.
WOOLF
There is no doubt about that.
He smiles.

59.
WOOLF (CONT’D)
May I speak plainly, Mr. Wells?
Wells looks at Acosta, then back to Woolf.
WELLS
That’s the only way to speak, Bryan.
WOOLF
Our clients will want to see a serious
plan to turn lab results in a volatile
region into an investment we can all
stake our reputations on.
WELLS
That’s not gonna be a problem -WOOLF
It’s not a problem, per se, but there
remains the fact that neither of you
have taken a find of this magnitude
all the way through production.
WELLS
Now wait a minute. We found it. We can
dig it up. It’s not that complicated.
WOOLF
(choosing words carefully)
Actually, historically, what we’ve
found is it can be quite complicated
and we’d like to help formulate how
you present the operations side.
Suddenly Wells is beginning to feel a little pushed.
WELLS
What does that even mean? What’s he
saying?
WOOLF
I’d like you both to consider bringing
on a strategic partner.
Wells is suddenly wary. And we see how small town he really
is. He lifts Woolf’s business card -WELLS
(reads)
Managing Director of Substrate
Minerals, Metals, Oil, and Gas. I
don’t even know what that is.
(MORE)

59A.
WELLS (CONT'D)
Have any of you ever set one of your
hand-made loafers down in a hole on
the side of a mountain? Washoe has
history.

60.
WOOLF
We’ve done a fairly thorough analysis
of Washoe, Mr. Wells. And we believe
you need some strategic help.
WELLS
It’s a new day. And Indo is goddamn
different.
(bangs table)
I know how to bring this baby in!
Acosta observes Wells for a moment. We think Acosta is going
to judge him, pile on... instead:

61.
ACOSTA
Wells came and found me. I was at a
low point, I’ll admit. It happens in
this business. Ups and downs. He
backed me with his last cent. More
than that he risked his life. Almost
lost it, too. And now we have the bull
by its horns.
WELLS
A big-ass bull!
ACOSTA
I’ve worked with the best and I can
tell you Kenny Wells is up there with
them. Which must count for something.
A declaration of friendship, and faith. This means the world
to Wells.
WOOLF
It does, Mr. Acosta. We’re not by any
stretch of the imagination suggesting
that anyone take a backseat, we’re
simply asking you to be open to
strategic alliances.
WELLS
No fucking way.
That’s that. Acosta goes to the window. He looks out.
ACOSTA
There’s something about finding gold -it’s difficult to put into words -the taste of it on your tongue, gritty
and electric, the feel of it between
your fingers. It’s like a drug. It
hooks you. It’s what you’re missing
here in the city; so you must
understand why we feel a bit
possessive over it.
(beat)
So I have proposal: put together your
institutional players, the guys who
rep the big money, whomever needs to
kick the tires on this thing... And
we’ll take them on a little trip up
the river...
Now Wells is looking at Acosta, starting to go with it -ACOSTA (CONT’D)
You know what river that is?

61A.
WELLS
The only river that matters -- the
KENSANA --!
ACOSTA
And they can decide for themselves if
we’re ready to scale this thing up.
CUT TO:
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT
JENNINGS
So it was Acosta who proposed the
junket to Kensana? Or did you cook
that up together?
Wells looking at Jennings.
WELLS
You just don’t get it. We weren’t
“cooking up” anything.
(MORE)

62.
WELLS (CONT'D)
I was getting hit from all sides by
people wanting in -- Hart Hubbard, my
neighbor, lawn care professional,
usually worried about Kay’s mulberry
over his back fence, only now he’s
dropping mining terms, “Kenny, I hear
the grade purity at Kensana is quite
high. How is the core frequency?” Hart
Hubbard. He cuts grass for a living.
JENNINGS
We’ve interviewed Mr. Hubbard.
Wells looks at Jennings and Banks and Levine. All dressed up
in their middle-class rectitude.
WELLS
I’m just saying I wasn’t feeling like
I had to cook up anything.
JENNINGS
So it was Acosta who proposed the
banker junket?
WELLS
(beat)
Yes.
(can’t help himself)
And it was a genius move. I don’t
exactly cut the right figure in a Wall
Street boardroom. They didn’t like my
suit or the smell of my whiskey. And
let’s be clear: we were in a fight, a
fight for control. With that one move
Mike shifted the balance of power.
CUT TO:
INT. JAKARTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
A group of BANKERS blinking in blinding tropical sunlight as
they follow Wells out of the terminal.
WELLS (V.O.)
They were coming to our house and that
was a whole new ball game.
OWENS (40), BINKERT and JACKSON (30’s). These are men set free
from the concrete jungle, ready for a taste of the real thing.
They all pull wheeled carry-ons, some dressed in the latest
“in” safari-wear from Ralph Lauren.
They’re met by Mike Acosta, in full bush gear. Suddenly the
Bankers’ outfits look foolishly ersatz.

63.
WELLS
Gentlemen, this is Mike Acosta.
ACOSTA
Anyone who wants to turn back, this is
your last chance.
They all look at him, “Is he fucking kidding?...”
WELLS
He’s messin’ with you, come on.
A few of the Bankers sigh, some aren’t sure.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Welcome to Indo, boys.
EXT. KENSANA RIVER - DAY
The front of a canoe breaks the plane, followed by Owens,
Binkert, Jackson... taking it all in. It’s one of those
perfect tropical days -- a balmy breeze, glorious sunshine and
billowing clouds hanging in an impossibly blue sky.
They pass TRIBESMEN panning along the bank.
WELLS
They’ve been panning this river for
five thousand years. That’s how it
got its name... Kensana. It means -He shoots a look to Acosta, making the Bankers wait for it...
ACOSTA
River of gold.
OWENS
That’s not real?
A smile between Wells and Acosta -- this is the show and
they’re loving it. And RISING UP the river is indeed gold
colored, snaking through hills of green.
EXT. WASHOE SITE - DAY
-- A BULLDOZER CLEARS A SECTION OF JUNGLE -- a CREW works a
DRILL RIG. Acosta shouts over the din, machete in his hand.
ACOSTA
When we got the hit, we stepped out in
a radiating pattern...We’ll keep going
until we have the complete picture of
(MORE)

64.
ACOSTA (CONT'D)
the underlying geology-- how long, how
wide, how deep. It’s this mapping that
gives us the real sense of what we’re
sitting on.
The men look down at the ground. It’s just ground. But their
imaginations are working. Acosta points all around them.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
It’s everywhere.
INT. WASHOE SITE - CORE SHED - DAY
Acosta leads the group into the CORE SHED. Throughout the
building, lying in wooden cradles, are the CORE SAMPLES -- six
foot long cylinders of rock and earth.
ACOSTA
Our typical drill depth is between
three and five hundred feet. We pull
out our core samples in six foot
segments, six inches in diameter
packed solid with rock and soil.
He moves to a massive workbench covered with crushed rock.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
This building is guarded 24/7 and kept
under lock and key.
Acosta pulls the leather thong around his neck from his shirt,
see a huge GOLD NUGGET and a key -ACOSTA (CONT’D)
This is the key.
With that, he hoists up a diamond blade CIRCULAR SAW and it
hums to life. He brings the blade down on the rock,
OBLITERATING the rock, and our hearing, as it cuts a threefoot section of core. Again, he shouts over the noise -ACOSTA (CONT’D)
The cores are cut into sections and
then crushed!
He heaves the cut section into a CRUSHER which AUTOMATICALLY
ACTIVATES the mechanism -- adding insult to aural injury.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
The pulverized cores are then bagged
and sealed!

65.
He produces a WAX-SEALED CANVAS SACK as an example. Starts to
heave it toward the bankers who dance out of the way -EXT. KENSANA VILLAGE - DOCKS - DAY
The SAME SACK lands on a freighter canoe with other sacks. All
labeled and sealed, and under GUARD.
ACOSTA
Under guard, the samples are sent down
river to independent labs in
Kalimantan. If a seal is broken or
damaged in any way, the lab, by law,
has to discard the entire sample.
(beat)
The bottom line is every safeguard has
been put in place to assure the
security of the process.
The Bankers nod, impressed. But that’s not really what they
came all this way for. They’re not quite sold.
WELLS
Diamond tipped saw blades, rock
crushers and core samples ripped from
the guts of the earth... It all sounds
great, but that’s not what you came to
see. Am I wrong?
JACKSON
No, you’re not.
Wells and Acosta exchange a knowing look.
WELLS
You boys want to see some gold?
EXT. KENSANA RIVER - TRIBUTARY - AFTERNOON
Late afternoon sun filters through the canopy. This could be
Eden. A few of the bankers, knee deep, pan the rocky bottom.
BINKERT
No one’s gonna believe this shit.
Owens swats at a bug. He looks more annoyed than impressed.
OWENS
So, what do you think?
BINKERT
Not sure. What about you?

66.
OWENS
Acosta seems to know what he’s talking
about but, I don’t know...
Jackson, working the river a few yards away, calls out!
JACKSON
Hey, come here - check it out!
Acosta heads out to him. Wells gestures to the pan.
WELLS
Looks like it might be the stuff.
Acosta holds the pan of mud up to the light -- glimmers of
gold are seen in the fading sun.
WELLS (CONT’D)
What do you think?
ACOSTA
Give me a minute.
The Bankers all watch, rapt -- Acosta takes the pan and moves
back to the river bank, dumps the mud into a waiting SLURRY.
He takes a bucket of river water and starts pouring the water
SLOWLY over the mud. Then, right before their very eyes...
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Keep your eyes peeled...
Like magic...
A HUGE GOLD NUGGET appears! Acosta holds it up into the light,
reveling in its sparkling quality.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
(tosses it to Jackson)
A few more like that and you can pave
Wall Street.
The Bankers are fucking speechless. Wells looks at the
converted Owens...
Pay dirt.

WELLS (V.O.)
CUT TO:

INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT
Jennings, jacket off, sleeves rolled up, paces.
the ice cubes in his empty glass.

Wells rattles

67.
WELLS
Now, I honestly don’t know if that was
just a stroke of luck or an amazing
piece of showmanship or both. But
when Jackson pulled that nugget out...
CUT TO:
INT. JAKARTA HOSTESS BAR - NIGHT
INDONESIAN GIRLS dance, somehow more naked than naked. It’s
Wells, Acosta and the Bankers -- everyone getting loaded.
WELLS (V.O)
...We had ‘em.
Acosta shouts out to the BARTENDER in Bahasa. MUSIC UP. Girls
dancing together. Acosta passing drinks to the bankers...
ACOSTA
It’s called a convex dome. What every
geologist dreams of finding and that’s
what I think we’ve got at Kensana.
Basically, it’s a volcano that’s
collapsed in on itself, forming an
inverted shell...
Wells cups his hands.
WELLS
...or a bowl full of all the stuff
we’re looking for.
BINKERT
How much “stuff” you think we’re
talking about?
Acosta smiles, throws back his drink and shouts out to a
waitress, holding up his empty glass, signalling for drinks.
ACOSTA
Our current assays point to a deposit
of anywhere from ten to thirty-five
million ounces. When we find the
dome, and we will find it, I wouldn’t
be surprised if we prove eighty to one
hundred million ounces...
Jackson still has the presence of mind to do some calculations
on his calculator. He looks at the number.
JACKSON
...Is that right?

68-69.
He redoes the calculations.

They all wait.

He looks again.

JACKSON (CONT’D)
You’re talking over thirty billion
dollars.
They all freeze. This is bigger than anyone imagined. Even
Wells suddenly has the queasy look of a man starting to look
at the drop on a roller coaster. He raises his glass.
WELLS
May we all be in heaven an hour before
the IRS knows we’re dead.
They laugh and, right on cue, out come the girls. Two for each
Banker. As one of the girls runs her fingers through
Jackson’s hair, her breasts pressing against his face, he
turns to Owens...
JACKSON
The business trips are going to be
outstanding.
OWENS
Hell of a write-off.
Wells and Acosta stand off together, watching as the magic
takes hold -WELLS
Not a bad day.
Acosta smiles. And as the party rages, WE GO:
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. AMERICAN HOME - DAY
Bright sun. As a car drives by and pulls into a sparsely
crowded parking lot, hear a phone STARTING TO RING from the
perspective of the caller. Then hear -Hello?

KAY (O.S.)

70.
INT. JAKARTA PALACE HOTEL - WELLS'S SUITE - DAWN
WELLS with a phone in one hand, drink in the other.
WELLS
What are you doing, baby? It’s me.
From halfway around the world.
KAY (V.O.)
Kenny!
(to someone OS)
It’s Kenny -(to Wells)
I was just telling some people the
story of how we met.
(continuing the story)
I’d run off from home, didn’t finish
high school--I had a couple teachers
who were real dicks--anyway, I was
working for a magician -Wells is twenty floors up, smiling at the dazzling fairy
lights of nighttime Jakarta.
WELLS
Not-So-Amazing Cecil -KAY (V.O.)
Cec had this one trick, his only
trick. Kenny came...
(to Wells)
How many shows in a row, Kenny --?
Wells looks inside the suite where a last dancer sways in
front of Acosta. The bankers have gone to bed.
Twenty --

WELLS

KAY (V.O.)
Twenty shows in a row. And the trick
was?
WELLS/KAY SIMUL
I wanted your number, baby/He wanted
my number -Hear OS LAUGHTER through the phone.
WELLS
I love that story.
INTERCUT:

70A.
INT. AMERICAN HOME - DAY
Kay on a white phone in the La-Z-Boy area. A few coworkers are
chuckling, heading back to their respective areas.
KAY
How’s it going over there?

71.
WELLS
They’re all in, baby. Everything we’ve
been waiting for. Everything --!
KAY
Wait. Kenny... Really? Really really?
Wells looks at the lights, which seem to dance with destiny.
WELLS
I’m sending a plane for you, baby. A
chariot like you deserve -- private
jet -- to meet me in New York City...
Blue skies...
(off her pause)
Did you hear me? Kay?
Kay holding the phone... Sees a MANAGER, CARL, signalling her.
I did...

KAY

She suddenly just turns away and JUMPS FOR JOY -WIDE IN THE STORE: Kay airborne --! Screaming with happiness.
WOOLF (V.O.)
...Brown, Thomas, in association with
Coleman and Mead Capital Group, are
proud to announce the initial public
offering of Class-A common stock...
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Woolf is holding the “Wall Street Journal,” reading the full
page “Tombstone” ad to Dresher and the room full of associates
and enthralled board members.
WOOLF
And the listing of Washoe Mining on
the New York Stock Exchange!
He holds the paper up with a smile. The boardroom ERUPTS!
EXT. THE WALDORF-ASTORIA - NIGHT
A town car pulls up. A DOORMAN opens the door. Kay looks
country and momentarily lost.
DOORMAN
Welcome to the Waldorf-Astoria, Ma’am.

72.
Kay looks country and lost.
INT. THE WALDORF-ASTORIA - VARIOUS - NIGHT
The lobby is majestic. Worldly patrons. The Vanderbilt room.
The hallway a dizzying assortment of patterns. The BELLMAN
opens the door of a suite. Her head is spinning.
INT. THE WALDORF-ASTORIA - WELLS'S SUITE - NIGHT
Kenny?

KAY

Yellow roses lead the way, the main room of the suite filled
with hundreds.
KAY (CONT’D)
...Are you here?
She heads into the bedroom and finds Wells nearly camouflaged.
WELLS
I wanted to surprise you... Are you
surprised? It’s your favorite flower,
right?
She takes in the huge suite, the Chrysler Building out the
window lit up like it’s marking the center of the earth.
WELLS (CONT’D)
You look beautiful.
KAY
Through thick and fuckin’ thin...
Thick ain’t so bad, Kenny Wells.
He takes her in his arms, rolling across the huge bed.
KAY (CONT’D)
Are these the softest sheets you ever
felt?
WELLS
Let’s get under ‘em.
And we begin to HEAR SHOUTING, a CRAZY ENERGY, WHICH TAKES US:

73.
INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - HALLWAY - MORNING
Wells and Kay exit the elevator and see Acosta waiting.
WELLS
My two favorite people in the world.
Kay, Mike. Mike, Kay.
KAY
(re: Wells)
You know this one stole my watch to go
meet you?
WELLS
That’s my girl.
ACOSTA
(laughing, to Kay)
Actually he omitted that detail.
(to Wells)
Kenny--?
KAY
I’m just teasing -WELLS
She’s teasing -KAY/WELLS/ACOSTA
No, she’s not -KAY
It’s really good to meet you, Mike.
They cross down the hall to find
WELLS
Bryan, Kay. Hollis, Kay. My man,
Stanton you know. Sweats as much as I
do...
And then all are whisked away by NYSE OFFICIALS. And we begin
to hear NOISE, like a sporting event is happening beside them.
ACOSTA
(to Kay)
You must be proud of him.

73A.
KAY
Never doubted for a second.
They both smile, knowing just how far they’ve come to get
here... Then a door opens and they pass INTO A VAST SPACE of
light and air:

74.
INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
ON THE FLOOR looking up at the balcony where suddenly WELLS
and KAY and ACOSTA appear amongst the bankers and OTHER
DIGNITARIES. Suddenly the room is QUIET in a HELD BREATH.
As we ZOOM up toward Wells and Acosta. Wells throws his arm
around Acosta as THEY RING THE OPENING BELL!...
DING!DING!DING!DING!
WELLS
(to Kay)
I’m ringing the bell, baby!
KAY
I’m so fucking proud of you, baby. So
fucking proud of you.
As we hear the ROOM ERUPT, we start pulling back -A102

INT. GREENHORNS - DAY
PULLING RIGHT OUT OF THE BAR TV: CNN coverage of the boys
ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
Bobby, Connie, Scotty, Roy, all the regulars, maybe have
stayed up all night to celebrate with Kenny.
And CELEBRATE THEY DO:
A SERIES OF SHOTS:
-- A STOCK TICKER -- WASHOE IS OFF TO THE RACES -$28.00...$35.00...
-- THE CNBC CRAWL -- $67.00... Behind the anchor, the Washoe
logo with the heading: “Washoe On The Move.”
-- THE TRADING FLOOR -- as purchase slips fall to the floor
like confetti. We GO TIGHT ON ONE OF THE SLIPS as it slowly
drifts in air -- “BUY: TRT @ $110.00”
WELLS (V.O)
In a single trading day we went from
twenty-three bucks to over a hundred
and ten. It was unbelievable.
(beat)
(MORE)

74A.
WELLS (V.O) (CONT'D)
The way I see it, what banks do, who
the hell knows, but what made this
country is not tight-asses in suits,
no offense, taking the safe way down,
it’s guys like Mike and me, who jump.
-- TALL BUILDINGS in Mid-Town. Black car. Doors opening. Kay
and Kenny exit, Kay feeling great in a new dress, shoes.
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - BAR ROOM - NIGHT
Waiters with trays of champagne. Binkert, Owens and Jackson
swirling around Acosta and Wells and Kay.
Then Woolf is pulling Wells and Acosta away.
WOOLF
Kenny, Mike, this guy may sit on your
board... if you’re very lucky.

75.
Kenny Wells and Mike Acosta shaking hands with the potential
board member. As Kay is quietly edged out of the circle.
DRESHER
Kenny, come say hi to the richest guy
in Delaware. And best looking.
Kenny meets the richest, best-looking guy in Delaware. As we
see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN openly watching Wells and Acosta.
A FEW MINUTES LATER
Everyone has gathered. Woolf leads a toast:
WOOLF
To a very good day... To Kenny Wells
and to Mike Acosta.
WELLS
To the mother lode!
And there’s that woman again. In his sight line. Light in her
eyes. Wells makes a show of downing his glass in one gulp -WELLS (CONT’D)
Fill ‘er up and keep it flowin’.
JACKSON
Kenny, Mike, try this on for size.
Jackson punches figures into his ever-present calculator.
WELLS
(to Jackson’s wife)
He sleep with that thing, or what?
JACKSON’S WIFE
He just sets it on vibrate and we’re
both happy.
JACKSON
As of the closing bell this is what
you’re both worth, on paper anyway.
And then Wells is looking at the figure, and even he is
stunned. Time slows and the world goes silent, like he’s
sliped into a dream.
And in this dream his heartbeat thuds, and bankers laugh; the
beautiful woman throws a seductive glance. And Acosta’s voice
from far, far away:
ACOSTA
A lot of zeros, my friend.

75A.
A crystal bell is tolling... for dinner. Everyone moves.
DRESHER
It takes them a full week to do their
rotisserie duck.
Kay watches Kenny, surrounded by admirers, head for the other
room. He forgets to look for her.

76.
A104

INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - POOL ROOM - DUSK
As guests pour into the famous POOL ROOM we find Kay. She
pauses, openly taking it all in as others pass. She clutches
her champagne flute like a wand.
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Camera sweeps across the now-candlelit room, murmur of
intimate conversations and laughter. It’s that time after
dinner before desert when people start table hopping. We find
Kay with an empty seat beside her. She glances up, watching
Kenny work the room.
WELLS
...It’s all gambling. Risk. If I
really wanted to make money, I’d stay
home on Sunday and bet pro-football.
We realize the beautiful woman is seated at the same table
where Wells is now holding court.
WELLS (CONT’D)
...Stallone on the sidelines in
Philly, Eagles won’t cover--!
Kay’s wine glass is refilled. She glances at Acosta who smiles
mysteriously.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Miami won’t cover in San Fran. Hell,
the game starts at midnight for them.
The woman catches his eye, holding out a hand. He gives her a
smoke and lights it.
RACHEL
Thank you. Rachel Hill.
Their eyes connect.

76A.
WELLS
What brings you out, Rachel?
RACHEL
I’m in Investor Relations. At Brown
Thomas. On the team.
There’s an empty seat across from her. He considers this. She
opens her hand in a gesture that says, please.
WELLS
Does that mean you relate to
investors?
RACHEL
Something like that.
Wells laughs. And Rachel laughs with him. Across the room Kay
downs her drink. She watches Wells say something and laugh
again. She doesn’t want to look at the way Rachel Hill smokes,
but she can’t help it.
WELLS
Rocks of gold as big as your knuckle
just sloshing along in the river --

77.
KAY
Hello, I’m Kay.
We realize instantly Kay is sort of drunk and emotional.
RACHEL
Hello, Kay.
WELLS
This is Kay, say hello to Rachel.
KAY
I just did.
WELLS
Rachel works at Brown Thomas. She’s on
the team.
KAY
I’m going to the washroom. Then I want
to leave.
Wells is supposed to say, “I’ll go with you,” but he doesn’t.
As Kay moves off, Wells catches Acosta's eyes on him, Acosta's
look asking: “What the hell are you doing?” But Wells's
attention is drawn back to Rachel as...
UNDER THE TABLE
Rachel’s sexy shoe drops from her sexy stocking foot, which
now moves it’s way under the cuff of Wells's pants leg.
She considers him cooly. Off his expression, WE GO...
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - LADIES’S RESTROOM - NIGHT
Kay looks into the mirror, trying to keep it together.
Two UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN enter, waiting for the mirror. The
women wait. Kay looks at herself in the mirror and WE GO...
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Rachel and Wells still talking. Wells all swept up with the
wine and newfound celebrity.
RACHEL
To go out into the wilderness and
discover something that everybody
wants... how does that feel?
They consider each other. Rachel’s foot is doing something
else under the table. In the twinkling room no one notices.

77A.
WELLS
Better than a kick in the ass.
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - BAR - NIGHT
As Kay makes her way up the stairs, she overhears:
WOOLF (O.S.)
It’s like a drunk raccoon found the
Hope Diamond. You don’t want to get
too close, but you don’t want to let
it get away either.
Laughter. It’s Woolf at the bar talking to a banker, LEWIS
HORNE. Kay pauses a moment to listen.

78.
HORNE
It’s your raccoon, Bryan. Do you let
it run a multi-billion dollar company.
WOOLF
And lose you as a client?
Woolf is shaking his head as Kay sidles up.
KAY
Who wants to buy a girl a drink?
Woolf covers:
WOOLF
Kay, meet Lewis Horne!
KAY
(to the bartender)
Three double shots of Jack.
(to Horne)
Lewis, I like that name, Lewis.
She’s flirtatious. Her cleavage like the prow of a ship. The
men share a glance: did she overhear? She raises her glass.
They raise theirs.
KAY (CONT’D)
I propose a toast-HORNE/WOOLF
Here, here -KAY
To a small creature...often taken for
granted or considered a nuisance just
because of its survival skills.
She heard.
KAY (CONT’D)
(fun fact)
Their babies are called “kits.”
(beat)
They are intelligent, fierce fighters,
and omnivorous. They eat anything.
Just like humans.
Kay--

WOOLF

78A.
KAY
And they’re cute even when they’re
waking you up ‘cause they got the lid
off your garbage can.
(beat)
To the raccoon.
She downs her shot. Smiles sweetly, leaves them there. Horne
downs his shot and watches her go, impressed and leering both.
HORNE
Do raccoons mate for life?
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As Kay approaches the table, she sees Rachel and Wells,
heating up. He turns, sheepishly. Kay picks up her bag.
KAY
Stay if you want. I’m going.
WELLS
Come on, babe, one more drink.
Kay heads for the door. Wells glances back to Rachel’s halfsmile, but suddenly Acosta is at Wells's side, standing over
him.
ACOSTA
What are you doing?
WELLS
What do you mean? Mike, Rachel --!
ACOSTA
Time to go, pal.

79.
INT. THE WALDORF-ASTORIA - WELLS'S SUITE - NIGHT
Kay walks in, Wells does his best to keep up with her. They
both make drinks right away.
KAY
...I don’t want to talk about it.
WELLS
I wasn’t doing anything.
KAY
I don’t want to talk about it.
WELLS
Okay, well maybe I should’ve banged
her right there on the table!
KAY
You’re too drunk to get it up anyway.
WELLS
I’ll take that challenge.
He tries to make a move. She shrugs away.
KAY
I don’t care about you flirting with
Miss Pneumatic ‘88. Think I haven’t
seen it before?
WELLS
Wait, her tits aren’t that big.
They’re not real?
KAY
None of this is real.
Kay --

WELLS

KAY
And you know what, none of it ever was
real. We drive up to look at that
dream ranch and it’s so nice, Kenny,
but on the way we pass through where?
What did we go right through?
He knows.
KAY (CONT’D)
Maggie’s Creek. Where your greatgrandad staked a claim.
(MORE)

79aA.
KAY (CONT’D)
And it’s a ghost town. Which is
exactly what this place feels like to
me.

79A.
WELLS
I knew if I brought you along, you’d
work overtime to screw it up for me.
KAY
You have never needed any help in that
department.
And she leaves the room. And he goes after her.

80.
IN THE BEDROOM
Kay sits on the bed, taking off her new shoes. Wells appears
in the doorway. Watches her a moment.
WELLS
You know what your problem is, Kay --?
KAY
No, why don’t you tell me -WELLS
You have no vision. It’s like your
whole world is this big -Wells holds up two fingers an inch apart -WELLS (CONT’D)
At one end is your kitchen sink and
the other end is the goddamn parking
lot of a furniture store.
That hurt, actually.
KAY
You mean an actual job that would
support a person in a place they live.
You mean that vision. You know what,
fuck you!
Fuck you!

WELLS

Now she starts packing her things, which really starts to piss
him off, and every item she drops in her bag urges him to say
more that he’ll regret later.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Yeah, run back to your crappy little
life.
KAY
I like my crappy little life. It’s
mine-WELLS
All you’ve ever wanted was a broken
bird-KAY
What the fuck are you even talking
about--?

80A.
WELLS
Oh, you said the right things, but in
your heart you didn’t believe them.
You didn’t believe in me. You like me
losing. It’s comfortable.
KAY
These people are using you. They don’t
care about you. And they certainly
don’t believe in you.

81.
She takes her old clothes into the bathroom. Door shuts.
Door opens. Herself again. Heading for the door.
WELLS
You just can’t let me have the win.
You don’t have it in you.
She passes by him without a look
WELLS (CONT’D)
Did it ever occur to you that I know
what I’m doing?
She looks at him, really looks at him.
KAY
I hope you do.
At the door of the suite, she turns.
KAY (CONT’D)
Where I’m from, if something seems too
good to be true, it usually is.
(beat)
I just never thought that applied to
us.
The door shuts automatically behind her. On the other side
find Wells staring at the door. Almost goes after her.
WELLS
I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING!
AT THE BAR -- Angry self-righteous cubes in the glass.
AT THE WINDOW -- the chasms of the city late at night -A GHOST TOWN.
CUT TO:

82.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT
More whiskey in a glass. Wells feeling no pain now either, or
maybe the same pain masked in the same way.
JENNINGS
What did you do next, Wells?
WELLS
What’d I do? What’d I do?
(beat)
I rode it. And what a ride, Jennings.
What a ride...
SMASH TO:
EXT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - LONG ISLAND - GOLDEN HOUR
The beaches of the south fork glow pink as a CHOPPER races
away from the setting sun.
EXT. DUNE ROAD LANDING PAD - GOLDEN HOUR
The landing pad on Dune Road, an X amidst sea grass and water.
As a chopper banks in over the Shinnecock Bay. Across the road
Owens and Binkert, dressed for monied summer fun, wait in a
mint VW Thing. Wells exits, ducking low. He crosses the road.
A114

INT. VW THING - DAY
Wells hops in the car. They pass him a six-pack as Owens pulls
out of the beach parking lot.
BINKERT
You know how you found the River of
Gold?
Yeah.

WELLS

OWENS
Well, it turns out, it flows to right
here.
The car toodles off down the sandy lane past massive houses
set back in the dunes.
EXT. DUNE ROAD BEACH PAD - DAY
Wells and Dresher with THOMAS CRANEPOOL, 5O’s, one of those
men who exude permanence.

82A.
CRANEPOOL
How’s it feel, Mr. Wells, to be a Rock
Star?
WELLS
Like I should be banging groupies, not
chatting up bankers.
CRANEPOOL
Oh, I imagine we can find a few of
those around here somewhere.
DRESHER
Be nice, Wells. This is our host,
Thomas Cranepool.
WELLS
I’m making a lot of these rich fucks a
lot richer, so I’m thinking I got a
little leeway.
As Wells saunters away, Cranepool smiles easily.
CRANEPOOL
Mi casa es su casa.
(to Dresher)
I hope he enjoys himself.
DRESHER
I don’t think you have anything to
worry about in that regard.

EXT. DUNE ROAD BEACH PAD - POOLSIDE BAR - LATER
The sun has dropped behind the trees. Wells gets the
bartender’s attention again.
BARTENDER
Seagrams on the rocks?
RACHEL (O.S.)
And I’ll have the same.
Wells recognizes that voice. It’s RACHEL.
WELLS
You sure you want to do that?
She signals the bartender: line it up, buddy.
RACHEL
It reminds me of my childhood.
(smiles)
So how is everything in the very
enchanted world of Kenny Wells?
WELLS
I feel like a million bucks only a few
hundred times better.
RACHEL
That must be a very nice feeling.

84.
WELLS
Looks like a few other people around
here feel the same way.
She follows his gaze. Faces of self-assured guests. Face,
face, face. In Rachel’s eyes, the net-worth of everyone.
RACHEL
...Maybe... Maybe not.
WELLS
Hey, you want to get wet?
RACHEL
That’s funny, Kenny.
WELLS
Why is it funny?
She leans in close to him, whispers something in his ear. His
expression tells us it was a direct hit.
EXT. DUNE ROAD BEACH PAD - HOT TUB - NIGHT
Wells and Rachel are in the hot tub. And she is perfection
itself, the kind of complete package used to escape every shit
backwater the world over since time began.
WELLS
So... how’d you... uh, end up out
here?
RACHEL
Well let’s see Kenny there are two
answers to that question, short form
would be, I know Tom. Tom is a friend.
She slides almost imperceptibly closer.
WELLS
I’ll bet he is.
RACHEL
Now, now. I stay with his cousin Timmy
down the lane. Timmy’s really quite a
character if you don’t know him.
WELLS
I don’t know Timmy.
RACHEL
I really don’t feel like talking.
She moves closer. He looks at the surface of the water.

85.
WELLS
Help, there’s a creature in here with
us, an octopus or something.
She leans closer to him, her chest is now against his chest,
and her hand still working, slowly, so slowly. She’s just
above him. And he’s looking at her.
RACHEL
Shhh, let’s just feel things.
And she moves again and we can tell it feels very good indeed.
Suddenly a VOICE from behind -HANCOCK (O.S.)
Wells? Kenny Wells?
Wells looks up at MARK HANCOCK. A trim, self-assured South
African mining mogul, CEO of Newport Holdings.
HANCOCK (CONT’D)
Mark Hancock. Seems I’ve caught you at
a bit of a disadvantage, Mr. Wells.
Wells doesn’t skip a beat. He stands, steps out of the tub,
completely naked, for all to see. Wells extends his dripping
hand, which Hancock, unflappable, accepts with a smile.
WELLS
Good to meet you. This is Rachel.
HANCOCK
I know the lovely Rachel.
Wells wraps a towel.
WELLS
Hancock controls more gold than anyone
else on the planet.
HANCOCK
With the possible exception now
of Mr. Wells.
Wells takes a moment, finding his smokes, checking out Rachel
in water and moonlight.
WELLS
So, this is how it happens?
HANCOCK
This is how it happens.
He lights a cigarette with his gold Dunhill lighter.

86.
EXT. THE SKYLINE OF MANHATTAN - SUNRISE
The sun rises through the buildings to the east. We’re
drifting down the Hudson, hearing the sounds of sex.
Pulling into the corporate chopper as Rachel rides Wells.
RACHEL
I’ve always wanted to do this.
WELLS
I wish to god it had occurred to me.
The chopper banks, the Statue of Liberty one direction, the
twin towers and all of Manhattan the other.
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Hancock and his lawyers are seated at one end, Wells's bankers
at the other including Dresher and Binkert. No one is
speaking, they listen to the rant coming from the next room.
WELLS (O.S.)
This isn’t a deal, it’s a goddamn rape!
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS
Wells paces like an animal. His personal banker, Stanton,
looks on, shocked. Woolf tries to talk him down.
WOOLF
Kenny, listen to me -WELLS
This is mine! I found it, me and Mike.
We were the ones up to our asses in
shit and mud and malaria and this
asshole offers a minority
partnership?!
Woolf stays cool, always reasonable.
WOOLF
Kenny, let’s keep perspective here.
When someone offers you this amount of
money, it’s a good day. You may say
yes, you may say no, but it’s not like
anyone’s trying to offend you.
WELLS
Well mission goddamn not accomplished.
Stanton steps up for Wells.

87.
STANTON
Bryan, this deal is shit and you know
it!
WOOLF
Hancock and Newport Holdings have the
expertise and the experience to bring
this home. This was always there as a
contingency. You know that.
WELLS
No. No. This is where Washoe Mining
becomes a player. Not Newport...
(looking at the papers)
I don’t even see our name. You took
our name off of it!? You took my name.
WOOLF
But again just taking a step back for
a moment, wouldn’t it not be terrible
to sit back and enjoy your success.
WELLS
Wouldn’t it not be terrible... What
kind of way of talking is that?
Wouldn’t it not be terrible for me to
just bend over and grab my ankles. You
think you can buy me out and take my
name and just vanish Kenny Wells to
the corn field?
Woolf has had enough.
WOOLF
If you hit the pause button for a
second and consider without emotion,
you’ll realize this is the kind of
very rare moment where with the stroke
of a pen, no one in your family, I’m
talking your children’s grandchildren,
will ever have to worry about money
again.
For once, Wells doesn’t respond right away. He pats for his
cigs. Stanton hands him one. Wells fires up and takes a long
drag, and finally looks at Woolf.
WELLS
See these hands? These are my father’s
hands. I clawed into the guts of the
hot earth with these hands. I will
bury you with these hands, Brian. Now
you go tell that silky sable Hancock
he works for Kenny Wells.

88.
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The air has been sucked out of the room.
HANCOCK
You know, I almost respect this
guy.
Hancock is already reaching for the phone.
CUT TO:
EXT. WASHOE SITE - DAWN
Tranquil, beautiful. Only the chickens are awake...
INT. WASHOE SITE - MAIN TENT - CONTINUOUS
Acosta at a desk, working with a slide rule planning something
cool. As the SOUND of military jeeps shatter the calm.
EXT. WASHOE SITE - MORNING
Military jeeps filled with armed SOLDIERS roaring down a
freshly cut road toward the site. A soldier steps from a
vehicle and begins a slow trek toward Acosta.
CUT TO:
EXT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - RENO -

DAY

Wells’s Caddy swings into a prime spot. It’s all fixed up now.
Fresh paint. He takes a moment to appreciate this turn of
events. And WE GO...
INT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
The chaos of a recent move-in, phones on the floor, lots of
busy employees. Wells is met almost immediately by Bobby Burns
and a few others.
BURNS
Where the hell have you been?! Mike’s
on the phone -Wells sees the panic in everybody’s eyes. Not good.

89.
He sweeps into his office, which looks out on Reno. There’s a
full bar, the elk head -- a kind of “You can take the man out
of the Greenhorns, but you won’t get the Greenhorns out of the
man” declaration.
EXT. KENSANA SITE - SAME TIME
ARMED INDONESIAN SOLDIERS herd WASHOE WORKERS out the gate
like frightened cattle, forcing them into the backs of trucks.
Acosta is caught up in a wave of workers as they’re pushed out
of the gate. Acosta speaks on a bulky satellite phone.
ACOSTA
They’re locking us out!
INT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - WELLS'S OFFICE - DAY
Wells stands at his desk, smoking.
WELLS
What? What are you talking about?
ACOSTA
They’re taking over the mine. The
military’s here, the Minister revoked
our exploration permits.
A terrifying realization begins to dawn on Wells.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
What happened at your meeting with
Hancock?
(yelling)
What happened at the meeting!?
WELLS
They were trying to push us out, Mike.
ACOSTA
Push us out? What do you mean?
WELLS
They even took our name, Mike. Right
off everything.
ACOSTA
You bloody moron.
WELLS
They can’t revoke the permit! They
can’t just steal it away from us!
Acosta is livid, screaming as he’s herded onto a truck.

90.
ACOSTA
I told you from the beginning: Suharto
can do whatever he wants!
Wells paces, he knows this could be the end.
WELLS
Oh, God... Oh, my God.
Acosta sees a SOLDIER knock one of the WORKERS to the ground
with his rifle. Fury in Acosta's face as he rushes over,
shoves the soldier out of the way.
ACOSTA
Do not touch my men.
The Soldier levels his rifle at Acosta. Acosta stares back.
Defiant. Acosta helps the worker to his feet.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
(Dayak, subtitles)
Get to the trucks. Go...
WELLS
Mike - what’s going on?...
(silence from the receiver)
Mike? Mike?!
Acosta backs away from the Soldier, turns and walks slowly
back to the phone... He picks it up. Finally -ACOSTA
We lost the site. You knew who you
were dealing with. They’re killers -Hancock first among them.
Wells seems to physically crumble -- he buries his face in his
hands. Completely at a loss.
WELLS
I’m sorry, Mike. I’m sorry.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT
Wells looks up at Jennings -- it’s not easy telling someone
what a fuck-up you are. He’s embarrassed, the pain of the
moment, the booze, the miles, all fresh on his face.

90A.
WELLS
It turned out that, in addition to
long-standing ties to Suharto, Newport
Holdings has on its Board an exPresident of the United States, who
was actually IN one of Suharto’s
weddings -- a groomsman.
(MORE)

91.
WELLS (CONT'D)
So the whole time they were looking me
in the eye offering to make my grandkids rich, they had a backup plan,
which was to steal it all away.
JENNINGS
And Acosta had ordered you to sell.
WELLS
Yes... no... he didn’t order me. We
were winging it, the negotiating I
mean, it was sort of agreed upon, the
direction, without really talking
about it, you know what I mean?
JENNINGS
Did he tell you to take the deal? Yes
or no?
WELLS
(reluctant)
...Yes.
JENNINGS
But you didn’t.
No.

WELLS

Jennings glances at the more junior men. This is significant.
Why not?

JENNINGS

Wells is now truly embarrassed. Finally, he gets it out.
WELLS
Because Kensana would become a Newport
mine and Mark Hancock's Midas touch
continues. Kenny Wells? A footnote -the lucky bastard who fell down drunk
and woke up in a pile of money.
Jennings takes a moment. Walks over to Levine. Confers for a
second. See them looking across the space at Wells. There’s
disagreement. Jennings comes back.
JENNINGS
That was a pretty foolish business
decision, wasn’t it?

92.
WELLS
It was my dream. I dreamed it. And if
you sell your dream, then what do you
have left?
EXT. KAY’S HOUSE - DAY
Wells pulls up. Sees his stuff in boxes and garbage bags on
her front lawn. He gets out. Then realizes Kay is sitting on
the stoop smoking a cigarette.
KAY
I’m just sitting here. Obviously this
is an emotional thing, but I’m not
going to let it get that way.
WELLS
What’re you doing?
KAY
What am I doing? Really? Okay. To make
this easier I’m sitting here making a
mental list. Of all the shit you never
did. A Shit Kenny Never Did List.
Kay --

WELLS

KAY
For instance... my “yard” -- it’s
pebbles and weeds. The “grass.” The
“sprinklers.” That’s next weekend. The
big hole in the back yard -- I mean,
the “pool.” Remember that? Because all
I see is crabgrass. And you. I see
you, Wells.
She starts to cry. And is mad at herself for it.

93.
And now she’s on her walk staring at the grass growing between
the cracks and through her tears she starts ripping at it and
throwing it at him.
KAY (CONT’D)
You see all this? See how hard it is?
It’s not hard. Look at me. Look. So
I’m just going to stay here with my...
Kay --!

WELLS

She starts kicking his stuff. Kicking it at him.
KAY
Take your stupid crap... Take it...
and leave my stupid crapgrass -And then she stops, realizing the thing she didn’t want to
happen --getting massively upset -- has happened.
KAY (CONT’D)
Wherever you’re going, whatever you’re
becoming, I don’t want to go with you
or become that.
WELLS
Kay... Kay, I’m sorry.
KAY
You’re always saying that where I’m
concerned. Go say you’re sorry
somewhere else for a while.
She goes inside and slams the front door behind, leaving him
outside with all his stuff. Which he now starts collecting.

94.
He throws it in the trunk of the car as HART HUBBARD,
neighbor, comes around the side of his house.
HART HUBBARD
Is this a bad time?
WELLS
Go fuck yourself, Hart.
Wells gets in and without a look back drives away.
EXT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - DAY/NIGHT
Wells pulls into the bar parking lot. The new leather interior
mocking him. Flicks ashes haphazardly at the console ashtray
and we see he’s already got a bunch of burn holes.
CNBC REPORTER (O.S.)
...Major news on Wall Street. Washoe
stock was off nearly fifty points at
the opening bell this morning...
The caddy parked outside in daytime. Then it’s night time.
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - NIGHT
Wells sits alone, unsteadily, at the bar. He watches the CNBC
MARKET REPORT. Roy watches Wells with concern as he pours the
last shot from a bottle of Seagrams.
CNBC REPORTER (ON TV)
...On news of the Suharto government’s
revocation of Washoe’s exploration
rights... There is talk of a deal in
place for Mark Hancock of Newport
Holdings to take over Washoe’s stake.
President and CEO Kenny Wells has not
commented publicly on the news.
Roy picks up the remote, about to flip...
WELLS
I’ll comment. They stole it. They
goddamn stole it.
(drinks)
I’m gonna need another.

95.
ROY
You’re gonna need to go home, Kenny.
WELLS
Yeah okay, Roy. A roadie then-ROY
How ‘bout a cab.
Wells just looks at Roy. By the look on his face, this could
go bad. But a smile comes to Wells's face as he slides off the
stool, wobbles onto his feet. It’s not a friendly smile.
WELLS
Piece of advice, Roy, and you should
take my word on this. You ain’t the
only game in town.
ROY
Go home, Kenny.
And as he sways for the door, Roy watching him sadly, WE...
STANTON (O.S.)
I’m telling anyone who’ll listen, we
have legal remedies. There will be a
settlement...
EXT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
The late afternoon sun sets the gold WASHOE sign aglow. As a
tired Mike Acosta gets out of a taxi. And takes in Reno in all
its desolate glory.
STANTON (O.S.)
...None of which I really believe by
the way...
INT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Burns and Connie listen to Stanton.
STANTON
I stemmed the bleeding for now, but
the bottom’s gonna fall out.
Scottie Nevins goes looks out the window.
NEVINS
Kenny was at the Greenhorn all nightrough. Roy bounced him. And I swung by
the house. Kay tossed him out.
Acosta enters.

96.
ACOSTA
Look at this. It’s like a clown car.
Trying to work the pedals with your
clown feet.
(beat)
Where is he?
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Kay is asleep in her bed. She’s awakened by the RINGING PHONE.
INTERCUT:
WELLS AT A PAY PHONE -KAY’S ANSWERING MACHINE (O.S.)
This is us, we can’t get to the phone
right now. You know what to do.
BEEP. ON KAY -- silence on the line.

Then -- CLICK.

WELLS -- he hangs up. He has to steady himself as he fishes
out more coins. He dials.
ON KAY -- the phone rings again. This time she turns on the
bedside lamp, sitting up listening.
WELLS (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Kay, it’s me. Are you there? If
you’re there will you pick up?
Hearing his voice hurts, but she’s not picking up.
WELLS is barely able to hold his head up, slogging through his
words. Cue the pity-party string section -WELLS (CONT’D)
Okay... guess you’re not home, then.
I was just calling to... I just wanted
to hear your voice. I screwed up,
Kay... I thought I could stake a
claim, and build something, something
real, that’s all I wanted... with
you... with Washoe...
(beat, sincere)
You were right. You were right.
The line goes silent. Kay looks stricken, but she fights the
urge to pick up. Wells leans his forehead against the phone -drifts off for a second. He comes-to with a start.

97.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Kay? It’s me... I’m gonna stop now.
I’m not calling anymore -She quickly picks up just as Wells hangs up -Hello?

KAY

Too late. Wells staggers a few paces and tries to light a
cigarette, but he’s too fucked up to pull it off. He throws it
away, turns back to the phone, searches around for change.
He’s out of change.
EXT. PAY PHONE AREA - MORNING
Wells passed out under the phone, receiver dangling. The caddy
parked at an odd angle, half over a curb. Door open. DINGING.
Then a boot pauses above him. Kicks him. Kicks him harder.
WELLS'S POV, staring up into a BACKLIT FIGURE. Another kick, a
voice from far away, the voice of God -ACOSTA
Get up. Get up.
A stunned look, the sun in his eyes, the sickness of booze.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
You don’t get to make the mistake AND
feel sorry for yourself. It’s one or
the other, mate.
WELLS
Would’ve been confused about who’s
kicking me when I’m down, then I heard
the condescension...
ACOSTA
You haven’t heard anything yet.
He starts to kick him again, but Wells pulls Acosta's legs out
from under him. And it’s on: a release of drunken pent-up fury
and failure, sloppy and real. They flail, tackle, expending
the agony of mutual failure, until they’re both wiped out,
sprawled on their backs.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
I propose a draw.

98.
INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - LATER
A JET OF COLD WATER ON WELLS.
INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - LATER
The shower is still running.
ACOSTA (O.S.)
How are you doing in there?
No answer. Acosta pulls back the curtain to find Wells sitting
on the shower floor, seemingly out cold.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Acosta holds out a Styrofoam coffee. Which he probably spiked
with Seagrams. MotherfuckingTheresa.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Here, get this down.
INT. MOTEL - ROOM - LATER
Acosta in the open doorway. Maybe a highway out there
somewhere. A gloomy day. Wells sits on the edge of a bed in
half light, the worse for wear.
WELLS
I think Kay’s done with me.
ACOSTA
Smart woman.
WELLS
(beat)
Mike, I’m sorry.
ACOSTA
You know what people say? That you’re
a drunk. Out of your league.
WELLS
Yeah? Well fuck them. I need a big
lecture from Mr. Golden Boy in his
golden glow. How hard and messed up
everything is. Tell me that from your
perch at the bar of the Jakarta Palace
after you’ve used that instinct of
yours to find some other big strike
with some other people.
Acosta stares at him a moment.

99.
ACOSTA
That’s what you think?
WELLS
That’s what I know. That’s what
everybody knows. You’re
MikeFuckingAcosta.
ACOSTA
I’ve never lacked for confidence...
Wells in agreement on that one. But Acosta seems to be
deciding whether to tell him something.
ACOSTA (CONT’D)
Okay. So we’re in North Sulawesi,
monsoon season -- this is 1980 -WELLS
The copper strike -ACOSTA
Yeah, the famous copper strike. Only
we were looking for bauxite. On the
way to where I’m planning to drill, I
get us stuck. Five feet of mud. We’ve
found nothing. We’ve drilled nothing.
We’re just sitting in the rain, day
after day, watching the metal rust.
WELLS
What’d you do?
ACOSTA
Under the theory that it’s better to
do something than nothing, I reported
this was where we were trying to get
to. Instead of being lost, we had
arrived. This was the spot... Nowhere
became somewhere -WELLS
The place you got stuck?
ACOSTA
Yeah. The place I got stuck.

100.
Wells looks up and slowly everything changes, it has a charm,
a purpose, it’s cool. It’s the place to hit bottom, part of
the legend. He goes up to Acosta. A beat. Then...
WELLS
I love that--!
Wells claps him on the back. Looks out at the same Reno he’s
always looked out at, the same grim futureless rain or dust or
whatever’s out there and now it looks different, too -- bright
and infinite and possible, just like his dream.
WELLS (CONT’D)
You were looking for bauxite and you
found copper. I went looking for gold
and I found a friend.
ACOSTA
That may be the single hokiest thing
I’ve ever heard in my life.
(off Wells's hurt
expression)
Okay, it’s true. But you did con me
into signing that goddamn napkin.
It’s the moment of truth for Kenny Wells.
WELLS
You know what we said when we started
this thing... So... you got a plan?
Don’t you?

ACOSTA

But ACOSTA has the beginnings of a slow smile. THE ROAR OF A
JET PLANE -- Wells turns and looks out the door -- and the
VIEW THROUGH A MOTEL DOORWAY is A RUNWAY IN JAKARTA as an AIR
INDONESIA JET drops out of the sky...
WELLS (V.O.)
Turns out, Suharto had a son, his
youngest, Darmadi - Danny -- bit of a
screw-up, a real problem for the old
man. So I guess you could say, we all
understood each other.
EXT. CILIWUNG RIVER - DANNY SUHARTO ESTATE - DAY
Wells and Acosta are ferried down an urban river in a swanky
taxi boat. They arrive at a colonial boathouse and disembark.

101.
WELLS (V.O.)
Suharto had been trying to get Danny
set up for years, but everything Danny
touched turned to shit. I figured if
we could bring Danny on board as a
partner, maybe he could get daddy to
change his mind and swing things back
our way. It was a Hail Mary from our
own one yard line, but it was all I
had... It also didn’t hurt that Danny
had been regularly ignored by a
certain ex-president of the United
States who was a groomsman at his
father’s third wedding and also
happened to sit on the board of
Newport Holdings.
They are led into a pool area where DARMADI “DANNY” SUHARTO
plays “chicken” in the pool with a GIRL on his shoulders.
WELLS (O.S.)
So, this guy walks into a Cadillac
dealership, okay?...
EXT. ESTATE - DAY
A massive estate. Wells and Acosta sit in the pool pavilion
with Danny, now in a lush bathrobe. Danny looks every bit the
royal child with skin that glows. He listens as Wells, in full
form, nails the joke...
WELLS
...Salesman says, “Excuse me sir, are
you thinking about buying a Cadillac?”
And the guy says, “No, I’m definitely
buyin’ a Cadillac. I’m thinking about
pussy!”
Wells laughs. Danny looks at Acosta and then back at Wells
who’s still laughing. Acosta drops his head as WE WAIT...
Danny stares at Wells. A long beat. Then...
DANNY
Cadillac is pussy magnet.
Danny smiles, then laughs. They all start to laugh. Acosta
can’t believe it.
WELLS
You like Cadillacs?
DANNY
‘62 Eldorado. Finest car ever made.

102.
INT. DANNY’S ‘62 ELDORADO - DAY
The Pixies’ “Where is my mind?” plays. Danny driving through
downtown Jakarta. Wells in the front seat, Acosta in back.
Danny on a driving pillow which raises him up in the seat.
DANNY
(yelling over music)
I love Pixies! I lived in Boston. My
sister went to Pine Manor. Dated -Points at Acosta in the backseat.
ACOSTA
Your sister’s crazy.
DANNY
My sister is so crazy. Is it too early
for a drink?
He nods at the glove box. Wells finds a bottle of BLACK LABEL.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Red label is for peasants -WELLS
That’s what I always say -INT. BAMBOO BAR - NIGHT
Danny, Wells, Acosta in a bar that hasn’t changed since the
Dutch were running things. Everyone knows Danny.
DANNY
Gerald Ford, tall man. George H.W.
Bush, a very tall man. Mark Hancock a
tall man. My father a small man. Small
in stature. But he loves his family.
WELLS
Mine, too. Then he died in the
driveway bringing in groceries.
Wells points to where his heart is. Danny raises a glass.
DANNY
To father of Wells -EXT. DANNY’S ESTATE - NIGHT
Voices in the dark, drunken, furtive. Then shapes emerge. Now
see Danny. A key tries to find a lock. Drops. Gropes.

103.
DANNY
85-15 split, if you have the balls.
ACOSTA
That’s robbery -DANNY
That’s deal. If you have balls. No
balls, no deal.
Now the key slowly fits in the lock. It makes a subtle
clicking sound.
ACOSTA
50-50 and I’d consider it.
Danny shakes his head, no. CAMERA NOW FINDS WELLS... Sweat and
true Hail Mary desperation all over his face.
DANNY
Kenny? Do you have balls?
ACOSTA
Don’t do it. It’s not worth it.
Wells looks again through the bars of a cage. He swallows.
Open it.

WELLS

The heavy bars slam shut behind him. Discover his eyes are
clenched shut. Slowly they open. Adjusting to the gloom.
WELLS'S POV -- YELLOW EYES, almost lit from within, moving,
belonging to SOMETHING VERY LARGE that paces in a circle.
DANNY
(whispered to Acosta)
Only 50 left in world.
Wells takes another step. A low GROWLING. He FREEZES. Wells
looks back at Danny and Acosta. Then takes another step -As a SUMATRAN TIGER
Moves forward into the moonlight. Crouched, ready to pounce.
DANNY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(reverent)
Sumatran tiger... very rare.
Wells slowly reaches out his hand. Closer. Suddenly -The TIGER ROARS.

104.

Wells --!

ACOSTA

Wells reaches out and touches the tiger’s head, right between
the eyes. The huge cat STILLS. Wells stills. A tableau -Kenny Wells’ hand touching a Sumatran tiger between the eyes.
Wells scratches with his knuckles.
WELLS
I’m touching a tiger! I’m touching a
goddamn tiger!!
CUT TO:
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - CORRIDOR - DAY
Big views over Manhattan on a stormy Monday morning. The
office seems dead. Woolf walks down a long hallway.
INT. BROWN, THOMAS - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Woolf steps into his office where he finds Dresher waiting.
WOOLF
Hollis. What’s going on?
DRESHER
You haven’t heard? Wells cut a deal.
WOOLF
A deal? What are you talking about?
Who’d cut a deal with him?
DRESHER
Suharto... The Indonesian government.
What?

WOOLF

DRESHER
Washoe retains fifteen percent of
the find, the other eighty-five
goes to the company of Suharto’s
choosing, which just so happens to
be owned by his son. Wells cut us
off at the knees.
Woolf is stunned.
WOOLF
What about Hancock?

105.
DRESHER
He’s gone. Can’t compete at that
number. Deal’s over, Frank. Wells and
Acosta are now the only outside
partners in the biggest gold strike in
history. We represent exactly none of
it.
WOOLF
Fifteen percent is a terrible deal.
DRESHER
Is it? What’s fifteen percent of
thirty billion dollars?
Woolf knows now he’s looking at the executioner.
WOOLF
I can explain -- you met him -DRESHER
You are going to be fine, Bryan;
you’ll land on your feet.
We stay on Woolf, in shock. The SOUND of a CHORUS of VOICES
rises, and WE GO...
INT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - DAY
Bobby Burns and the boys singing along drunkenly to some song.
As Wells enters carrying a heavy, taped-up roll of fabric, and
a small, wrapped gift. Booze and music and cigarettes as they

WELLS
Hey, Roy. Seen Kay around?
ROY
You didn’t hear?
WELLS
Hear what, Roy?
ROY
She quit. Got the promotion out at the
American Home -- Assistant Manager.
Proud of her.

...In our top money news, a story that
is being compared to David and

As someone TURNS UP THE VOLUME on THE TV above the bar -CNBC REPORTER (ON TV) (CONT’D)
Washoe Mining has secured a deal with
the Suharto government of Indonesia to
retain control of their massive gold
strike there, fending off a takeover
by Newport Holdings.
CONNIE
Kicking Hancock’s ass -More CHEERS. WELLS is the center of attention.
CNN REPORTER/WELLS SIMUL
Washoe shares are soaring on the news.
As CLIVE Coleman spots Wells. Wells sees Clive as he
approaches. Whatever he’s here for, it looks serious.
CLIVE
Got a minute?
Wells steps out with Clive.
EXT. THE THREE GREENHORNS BAR - LATE AFTERNOON
Strip plazas, dollar stores, pawn shops. And the first star in
the sky, the Northern Star. Or a planet. One of them.
CLIVE
I just got a call.
Wells freezes. Clive enjoys the moment. Giving away nothing.
CLIVE (CONT’D)
The National Association of
Prospectors is gonna honor you with
the Golden Pickaxe.
WELLS
Are you shitting me?
CLIVE
You are officially the best miner in
the world. And somewhere I’m sure your
dad is smiling.
There, outside The Three Greenhorns Bar, Kenny Wells has
finally been accepted on terms he cares about.
WELLS
Well if he’s not smiling, I’ll smile
for the both of us.

107.
He can’t speak any more. Too overcome by the moment. And then
he realizes where he’s gotta go -INT./EXT. AMERICAN HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
The Caddy pulls up. Wells gets out. Opens the trunk. Gets that
big roll of gift fabric he bought in Indo.
He’s happy. A peace offering in hand. Starts forward, then
stops. He stares, his face falling. He sees -KAY,
Wearing her own clothes, a manager now, smiling at something
her boss is saying. She rests a hand on his arm -OMIT
EXT. KAY’S HOUSE - DUSK (MINUTES LATER)
THE ROLL OF FABRIC HITS THE FRONT DOOR and drops to the stoop.
Then the wrapped gift hits the door and drops.
Wells back in his car. Door SLAMS. Car CAREENS AWAY, barely
breaking around a distant turn.
CUT TO:
EXT./INT. HARRAH’S HOTEL AND CASINO - RENO, NEVADA - DUSK
The Caddy rolls up under the awning at Harrah’s. An unctuous
MANAGER welcomes Wells personally.
MANAGER
Welcome to Harrah’s Reno, Mr. Wells.
WELLS
Thank you very much... Carissa.
MANAGER
We have you in the Prospector Suite,
which has a wonderful view of the
mountains. Will you need help with
your bags?
Oh, yeah.

WELLS

He looks back at the Caddy as the luggage trolley passes.

108.
DESK MANAGER
The Prospector Suite has a lovely view
of the mountains, Sir.
WELLS
I’ll take it.
DESK MANAGER
Will you need help with your bags?
Oh, yeah.

WELLS

INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
The boxes he took from Kay’s. Rodeo clown ashtray. A few
childhood pictures. Young Kenny holding a string of bass.
Grandfather on a side of a mountain. His father standing next
to a new Caddy, looking for all the world like Wells.
There’s a KNOCK at the door of the suite. Wells opens it to
find MIKE ACOSTA standing there.
WELLS
I didn’t think you could make it.
ACOSTA
(pure Wells)
Who you talking to, Wells?
(beat)
Besides, you’ll definitely need help
with your tie.
INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - MASTER BATHROOM - EVENING
Gold fixtures everywhere. Acosta sitting on a counter watches
Wells wrestle with the bow tie.
WELLS
I’m nervous.
And the bow tie does present a mystery.
WELLS (CONT’D)
A thousand monkeys, a thousand
years... Okay, hotshot...
Acosta quickly ties the tie. Adjusts it. And now we see a
changed Wells. He looks good. Catches himself in the mirror.
Acosta catches the same reflection.
Wells pulls cards from his jacket. Looks at Acosta. A true
friend is the one you feel comfortable practicing this kind of
speech in front of.

109.
WELLS (CONT’D)
My great granddad came out here on a
wagon. He had a horse and two mules...
(to Acosta)
Too much?
ACOSTA
No, man. It’s good.
EXT. RENO SKYLINE - SUNSET
Mountains in the distance.
INT. HARRAH’S HOTEL AND CASINO - BALLROOM - NIGHT
Wells at his table with Acosta, Bobby Burns, Stanton, Clive,
Connie, Nevins. He’s quiet. This means a lot him.
BOBBY BURNS
Kenny, you’re a star, boy. Don’t sweat
it. I mean really, don’t sweat.
He’s sweating. Someone passes him a napkin.
MC (O.S.)
It’s been a long night and I’m sure
you will soon hit the tables here at
Harrah’s Reno and make it a lot longer
night. And hit those tables people...
it’s why Verna makes the rooms so
reasonable.
Laughter around the room. A few big firms have tables. And
lots of smaller players. It’s everyone’s night.
MC (CONT’D)
They do accept gold for bar tabs...
(laughter)
Now we come to our last honor, the
1988 Golden Pickaxe for “Prospector Of
The Year,” which goes to our own Kenny
Wells! Get up here, Kenny--!
Wells rises and makes his way, showered with applause and
FLASHING cameras. The crowd rises, saluting Wells, saluting
that part of themselves that hangs on, refuses to give up.
Wells cradles the Golden Pickaxe statue, which is exactly as
it sounds, a golden pickaxe. He stares out, savoring his
moment. Then holds it up as flashbulbs flash.
Pulls his speech from his pocket. Looks out at faces, laughing
faces, no one taking this quite so seriously.

110.
WELLS
Every last one of us who calls the
great state of Nevada home arrived
here with a dream.
VOICE (O.S.)
(yelling out)
Drinks on Kenny.
Laughter. And AT WELLS'S TABLE -BURNS
Great state of Nevada?
He sees Kay. He smiles. Realizes it’s not her.
WELLS
...That was my great granddad who came
out here on a wagon. Had a horse and
two mules when they finally stopped
moving and said this was the place, he
was only about forty miles from right
here.
At the back of the room, ACOSTA IS LEAVING. He pauses and
turns to Wells. A nod of respect and congratulations passes
unspoken between them. And then ACOSTA IS GONE.
Wells looks at the statue.
WELLS (CONT’D)
What is a prospector?
(the crowd groans)
No, I’m serious. It’s someone who
believes it’s out there. Who wakes up
every morning and somehow believes.
Again and again. It’s not there.
Standing at the edge of a desert,
watching the sun rise and something in
him says, “it’s that way, just walk.”
FLASH, FLASH, FLASH! Wells walks the center aisle, drowned in
flashing light and glorious adoration. Everyone’s reaching out
to shake his hand.
WELLS (V.O.)(CONT’D)
And the sun is higher and it’s getting
hot and nobody else sees anything. And
everyone else wants to turn back...
And then IT’S LATER and EVERYONE’S CROWDED AT THE BAR.
Champagne corks are popping. POP POP POP.

111.
WELLS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
And everyone else has turned back. And
now he’s alone. And it’s burning hot.
And there is no water...
And ON THE CASINO FLOOR Wells is PLAYING ROULETTE. The WHEEL
IS SPINNING. STACKS OF MONEY are moving. SHOW GIRLS ARE
FLOCKING.
Then IT’S EVEN LATER. WELLS IS SPORTING DRINKS ALL AROUND.
Champagne. POP POP POP.
WELLS (V.O.)(CONT’D)
It’s out there... It’s out there...
It’s out there...
TIGHTER ON THE FACE OF KENNY WELLS as he sits back at his
table, accepting the congratulations of his friends. As people
call his name and cheer and FLASHBULBS POP -- POP POP POP -BACK AT THE PODIUM. Tight on Wells as he takes in all of the
listening faces.
WELLS (CONT’D)
And it doesn’t matter whether he finds
it or not. It doesn’t matter. That’s a
prospector.
He basks in it, the words vibrating for everyone in the room.
INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - MORNING
Tracking across the detritus of a huge night to find Wells in
bed, sound asleep. The phone starts to RING -- Wells doesn’t
move. Then finally he moans, rolls toward the phone -WELLS
Hello..? What..? What?
Wells is instantly awake. Hear the INDONESIAN FOREMAN saying
something FRANTIC over the and over-WELLS (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I can’t understand you. No
go? I don’t understand. Slowly. Speak
more slowly.
AT THE WASHOE SITE: THE FOREMAN YELLING INTO A SATELLITE
PHONE THE SIZE OF A SUITCASE.

112.
FOREMAN
(slowly)
No gold. There is NO GOLD.
The window behind Wells reveals sun just catching the peaks,
flaming morning gold. Wells grips the phone like a lifeline.
EXT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
A mob scene outside. As Wells pulls up in his car, the crowd
converges on him. He can barely get his car door open. He
squeezes out and pushes through the furious crowd -WELLS
I don’t know any more than you do
right now!
...But nobody’s hearing him -- PEOPLE shout out: “You fucking
thief!” “I’m gonna kill you!” “Where’s our money?!”
WELLS (CONT’D)
I will get to the bottom of this!
I promise!
Suddenly, out of nowhere -- A FIST -- WHAM -- right across
Wells's face! It staggers him. The crowd lets out a roar of
approval. This is getting real ugly, real fast.
A PAIR OF HANDS GRABS WELLS. He turns, panic in his eyes -but it’s Connie Wright. Bobby Burns is with him. They pull
Wells through the mob to the building’s side entrance.
CONNIE
Total shit storm, Kenny.
Wells is still dazed.
WELLS
I know... I know...
They fight the last few feet to the door and as they force
their way inside, WE FOLLOW THEM...

There’s no gold, Kenny. There’s no
goddamn gold. There never was.
WELLS
That’s not possible.
SEQUENCE OF SCENES -CNN NEWS CENTER -- A professorial looking MINING EXPERT
explains to a NEWS ANCHOR...
MINING EXPERT
It’s called “salting” and it literally
means, when someone sprinkles gold
dust into a sample of rock, like you’d
add salt to a steak.
GOLD DUST -- pours onto a DIGITAL SCALE.
MINING EXPERT (CONT’D)
By all appearances, Washoe’s security
protocols were iron-clad. But if the
person administering security is
fraudulent, the system breaks down.
Then, the gold dust sprinkles into a GROUND SAMPLE OF ROCKS -MINING EXPERT (CONT’D)
...It’s the oldest trick in the book.
NEWS ANCHOR
“Oldest trick in the book.” And yet
major mining corporations, investment
banks, auditors, everyone was fooled.
MINING EXPERT
We weren’t fooled; we didn’t look.
TIGHT ON: A MAGNIFIED IMAGE -- TWO GOLD SAMPLES, side by
side. The one on the LEFT has smoothly rounded edges; the one
on the RIGHT is angular and jagged.
GEOLOGIST (O.S.)
The image on the left is the type of
gold found in the Washoe samples.
This is river gold - notice how the
edges are rounded, worn smooth by the
erosion of the water.
WE PULL BACK to --

A FINANCIAL SHOW -- The GEOLOGIST is seated across from a Jim
Cramer-type financial HOST.
GEOLOGIST (CONT’D)
...What we should have found is flake
gold - the sample on the right, pulled
directly from the rock, rough edged
and angular.
The Host is nearly apoplectic -HOST
That seems like a pretty big freakin’
detail to overlook!
GEOLOGIST
It’s a big detail. But you have to
understand, everything else about the
Washoe samples was right...
HOST
...But the gold was wrong! It’s right
there, that’s what you’re saying?!
Yes.

GEOLOGIST

INT. WASHOE HEADQUARTERS - WELLS'S OFFICE - DAY
The guys are hard at work, going over financial documents.
Wells is on a phone at the center of it all -WELLS
(into phone)
Acosta? Mike Acosta? No. Yes, I do
mind waiting -- Did he or did he not
come to the Kalimantan?
Bobby Burns approaches Wells. Burns looks gut-punched.
BURNS
The New York Stock Exchange just
suspended trading. They’re taking
Washoe off the board.
Washoe is done, finished. Wells sinks back in his chair. And
slowly hangs up the phone. The news seems to take whatever air
he’s got left out of him.
A long silent moment. There’s nothing more to say, but Burns
just stands there. He looks in shock, like he’s had his soul
ripped out. Wells looks up at him...

115.
WELLS
You sold some, right? Put something
away?
Burns hesitates before answering...
BURNS
Yeah... Of course. You?
Wells nods halfheartedly. It’s clear neither sold a damn
thing.
Bobby?...

WELLS

Burns can’t meet Wells's eyes.
WELLS (CONT’D)
Goddammit, Bobby! I told you to sell
some.
BURNS
I thought...I thought... it was just
going to keep going up.
Wells is genuinely distressed. And then Burns looks up -- his
eyes are damp, on the verge of crying. He can barely speak...
BURNS (CONT’D)
Kenny, did you know, Did you know,
Kenny?
It’s like a blow to the heart.
WELLS
What? Did I know? I can’t believe you
would ask me that.
Burns looks absolutely crushed.
WELLS (CONT’D)
I’ll take care of you, Bobby.
Connie rushes in carrying a sheath of PAPERS.
Kenny...

CONNIE

Burns’ expression hardens -- fists clenched like he’s gonna
punch Wells.
BURNS
I don’t want you to take care of me!
I want you to leave me the hell alone!

Burns walks away, a busted man.

What?

Wells turns to Connie.

One

WELLS

CONNIE
I don’t even know how to say this -He dumps the papers on Wells's desk.
Look.

CONNIE (CONT’D)

Wells reads. It doesn’t take him long to understand. He throws
a glass at the wall. It shatters.
WHAT!!!???

WELLS

Connie answers Stanton’s questioning look.
CONNIE
Acosta was dumping stock. Shell
companies. Banks in the Philippines,
the Azores. Multiple layers. All offshore.
How much?

STANTON

CONNIE
Get ready for it... 164 million.
WELLS
I don’t believe it.
STANTON
Son of a bitch! What do we do? Kenny?
WELLS
There’s gotta be an explanation. We
gotta find Mike!
AT THAT MOMENT, they hear TIRES SCREECHING, CAR DOORS
SLAMMING. And look outside. DOZENS OF AGENTS rolling up, the
familiar blue jackets with the white lettering -- FBI. Hear
them entering. Then, a BULLHORN:
FBI
This is the FBI! Step away from your
desks! Take two big steps away from
your desks. Do not touch anything!

MONTAGE of FBI raid. Floor by floor. They arrive at Wells's
office. Connie and Stanton in the middle of the room, frozen.
Wells at the window. Below, he sees the SPECIAL AGENT IN
CHARGE step out of a car, already giving quiet orders -It’s JENNINGS.
Who looks up. Sees Wells at the window. Wells looks at him.
INT. NBC NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT
Sitting with ROGER MUDD is MARK HANCOCK, chairman of Newport
Holdings. Hancock as clean as snow as he rewrites history.
HANCOCK
We suspected there were problems early
on, which is why we decided not to
pursue the joint venture Washoe
offered us. We got as many of our
investors out of Washoe as fast as
possible.
An insert PHOTO of Kenny Wells and Mike Acosta appears.
ROGER MUDD
You made a lot of money. I mean before
the walls came tumbling down.
Hancock doesn't want to talk about that.
ROGER MUDD (CONT’D)
And how much money was lost in the
fraud? That we know of.
HANCOCK
Billions. Large institutional
investors lost billions of dollars.
ROGER MUDD
So one, or maybe both of them, two
outsiders took everybody on Wall
Street for a ride.
HANCOCK
Yes, it really looks like they did.
ROGER MUDD
And Acosta has vanished.
HANCOCK
With hundreds of millions of dollars.

ROGER MUDD
Kenny Wells has consistently
maintained his innocence, that he was
duped along with everyone else. Given
that, what do you make of this?
He picks up a copy of NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE -- Kenny Wells on the
cover. Mudd reads the caption out loud:
ROGER MUDD (CONT’D)
“Kenny Wells - Fool or Mastermind?”

Off Hancock, maybe for the first time, he’s at a loss...
HANCOCK
That is a very good question, Roger.

Wells stands on the steps in front of the building, a hundred
MICROPHONES and CAMERAS in his face. NEWS VANS jam the
sidewalk. A mob of ANGRY PROTESTORS held at bay by POLICE.
WELLS
Mike Acosta was my friend and partner
and he betrayed me. I had no knowledge
of the deception he perpetrated. As
CEO of this company, it was my job to
know. I take full responsibility for
my failure in this regard and I
apologize sincerely to those who have
lost their investments. Wherever you
are, Mike, it’s time to come in. Tell
what happened... Mike --?
He can’t go on. Finally, he chokes out -WELLS (CONT’D)
That’s all I have to say at this time.
The assembled reporters shout out a flurry of questions at
Wells's back as he leaves. They pursue him. Surrounding his
car. Trying to stop him from pulling out.

recorder on the table. Wells at the bar searching, finding the
stashed bottle.

Wait, what do you mean? You’re not
telling me something. What happened to
Mike?
JENNINGS
A lot of very powerful people are very
angry at Michael Acosta.
WELLS
What happened!?
Jennings searches Wells's face again for a trace of the
disingenuous.
JENNINGS
What happened? Yes. That’s what we’re
trying to put together.

121.
JENNINGS (CONT'D)
Seventeen billion dollars of value
disappeared overnight. That is
certain. What else? Michael Acosta
waves goodbye to you in the ballroom
downstairs -- ta-ta -- goes back to
Indonesia on a jet chartered with
Washoe funds, and then he does his
disappearing act. This you know...
Off Wells -- PRE-LAP:
The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS, growing louder.

Deafening...
SMASH TO:

EXT. JUNGLE - PRE DAWN
A helicopter chops at the morning air -- flying in low over
the lush jungle as the sun is about to rise.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
First, he’s locked out of the assay
lab in Kalimantan by The Minister of
the Interior. So he goes back to
Jakarta.
EXT. JAKARTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
Acosta emerges from a plane and walks down the gangway stairs.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
Where he is immediately detained by
Indonesian Military.
Waiting for him at the bottom are INDONESIAN SOLDIERS.
OFFICER
(subtitled)
This way Mr. Acosta.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
And they hold him while they try to
reproduce for themselves the lab
results claimed by Washoe.
INT. INDONESIAN MILITARY BARRACKS - DAY
Acosta watching men march in formation through a doorway.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
Which of course they are unable to do.

122.
INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - DAY
Jennings takes his time. He’s enjoying this a little.
JENNINGS
And at this point either he’s being
moved to an actual prison, or he’s
bribed one of the officers. Either
way, he’s on a military helicopter.
INT./EXT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY
Acosta sits in the hold of the chopper, two soldiers across
from him, a pilot and another SOLDIER up front, all armed.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
They fly north loosely tracking the
Kensana river.
The chopper arcs in, following the river’s course.
Acosta stares out, far into the distance, taking in the
breathtaking beauty.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
Do not underestimate the Suharto
family. They are gangsters whose turf
is a nation of 100 million.
Acosta in the back of the chopper. He’s got a six-pack of
Tuborg Gold in cans. He cracks one, holds the others out to
the soldiers, who decline. He drains the beer. He looks down
at the river as it passes far below, flashing gold in the
sunlight, a snaking golden river, golden dream -Hands suddenly undo his harness. An involuntary breath. Then a
smile creeps onto his face.
Acosta now at the open hatch door of the chopper. Tighter on
his eyes taking it in. He’s coming home.
IN SILENCE MIKE ACOSTA FALLS FROM THE HELICOPTER
Falling and falling and falling toward canpoy and water --

123.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
A thousand feet up, over the Kensana,
Mike Acosta takes a header.
ON THE PILOT -- as he turns and looks back and sees the EMPTY
SEAT, the soldiers buckling back in. He turns back around.
ACOSTA POV of ONRUSHING RIVER. CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THEN ALL
AT ONCE AS WE SMASH -INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - DAY
Wells is on the edge of his seat, eyes red from lack of sleep,
booze, cigarette smoke. He’s shaken up by the news. He doesn’t
want to believe it.
WELLS
No way. No fucking way. Mike was too
good, too savvy. He had to be planning
this. He knows what they do to you for
salting. What you think they’d do. He
faked it. Or he paid just to have the
story out.
(desperate)
164 million goes a long way in
Indonesia...
JENNINGS
(beat)
They found a body.
WELLS
Are you sure it’s him?
JENNINGS
I’m not sure of anything, except Mike
Acosta traded water filters for river
gold, but now the Indonesian
government has gone unusually quiet on
the subject and seems to have,
publicly at least, lost all interest
in finding Michael Acosta.
EXT. INDONESIAN JUNGLE - DAY
THE CRANE SHOT of the INDONESIAN MILITARY and DAYAK in semicircle around the SPLAYED BODY.
One of the soldiers breaks ranks and moves forward, kneeling
by the body. What he sees there sickens him --

124.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
Hands and face were eaten away.
Probably by wild pigs.
BANG. All heads whirl. The BIG SNAKE FALLS. Floats down river.
The soldier finds the wallet, flips it open, checks the ID.
And this time we see the name -- MICHAEL ACOSTA.
And a picture of MIKE ACOSTA, smiling.
JENNINGS (V.O.)
There was an autopsy, corroborating
the identity with dental records from
Boston.
INT. PROSPECTOR SUITE - DAY
Jennings produces documents with a sort of bemused skepticism.
Autopsy. Photos of a pig-eaten body. Affidavit of cremation.
JENNINGS
Then they sealed the report, cremated
the remains. Interestingly Danny
Suharto dumped a lot of stock as well.
So the Suhartos are even richer, Mike
Acosta is ostensibly dead and buried,
a hundred sixty four million is still
missing, and the question I’m left
with is whether or not you were in on
it?
Wells takes a moment. Slowly shakes his head. Sad.
WELLS
I can’t believe it.
JENNINGS
Can’t believe what?
Wells eyes well up. He rubs at them, making them even redder.
He lights a cig to cover the emotions.
WELLS
...Everyone in the business had
written him off, called his theories
crap, and he couldn’t let that be the
last word on him.
JENNINGS
You talking about Acosta or yourself?
Wells ignores that.

125.
WELLS
We were running out of money and I was
sick with Malaria, I think that’s when
the salting started. Mike was sure he
was right, the gold was there, but he
needed to buy us more time to find it.
I don’t think he set out to swindle
anyone, but by the time he realized he
was wrong and there was no gold, he
was in too deep. I honestly think he
just didn’t want to let me down. And I
was fooled just like everybody else.
A pregnant beat. Levine, Jennings’ underling, leans down. He’s
saying something that is mostly muffled... “Either world’s
biggest fool or...”
LEVINE
...he’s not telling the truth -WELLS
The truth!? The only truth here is
that when everyone’s getting rich
nobody gives a shit about the truth.
All anyone had to do was look. Open
their eyes. The gold was wrong. The
find was too good. Red flags
everywhere, but no one looked, because
no one wanted to know. Not me, not
you, not anyone. What we all wanted
was to believe. Why? Because we were
making so much money.
Jennings looks over at Banks and Levine. That landed.
JENNINGS
(to his coworkers)
Mark, Eric, sit down please.
Jennings checks the cassette on the tape recorder. And when he
addresses his questions to Wells we can feel it’s all coming
down to this.
JENNINGS (CONT’D)
Were you aware that Mike Acosta was
salting the Washoe core samples?
No!

WELLS

JENNINGS
You had no knowledge Mike Acosta was
perpetrating a fraud?

126.
WELLS
No. I thought I’d won the lottery.
JENNINGS
You were not in collusion with Mike
Acosta on the Kensana gold strike?
No.

WELLS

JENNINGS
Did you profit from the Kensana fraud?
WELLS
You know I didn’t. I can’t pay the
hotel bill. Hell, I can’t even get the
minibar.
JENNINGS
Did anyone close to you profit?
No.

WELLS

JENNINGS
You have gained nothing?
WELLS
My friends lost money, my neighbors
lost money, but I lost everything.
Because, the real truth is... I never
cared much about money. I cared about
gold. It’s different, Jennings. It’s
different.
Jennings, Banks, and Levine walk away and confer. It’s clear
they’re having a difficult time reaching a quorum.
Wells turns and looks at the mountains. And then Jennings
crosses back.
JENNINGS
(into tape recorder)
End of deposition, 6:45 AM, Seventeen,
October, 1988, conducted by Paul K.
Jennings - Special Agent In Charge,
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
District of Nevada, Reno.
He presses stop on the recorder. Closes his notes. He and
Wells look at each other a long moment.
JENNINGS (CONT’D)
You’re free to go, Mr. Wells.

127.
Wells seems like he wasn’t expecting this and maybe almost
like he was past caring about it.
WELLS
Look at that, somebody believes me.
JENNINGS
I wouldn’t go overboard. In fact, I
wouldn’t leave the state. Wouldn’t
start buying new stuff or chartering
any more jets.
WELLS
I gotta sneak out of here without the
front desk guy seeing me. You picking
up that tab?
JENNINGS
It’s been quite a whirlwind, hasn’t
it, Mr. Wells?
Wells has no fucking idea how to even begin to answer that
one. As the coworkers leave -BANKS
Good luck, Mr. Wells
LEVINE
We’ll be keeping an eye out for you.
Jennings starts to leave, then pauses -JENNINGS
What are you going to do now, Wells?
And as we push in on Wells, we can see deep in his eyes the
beginnings of a plan...
EXT. PARKING LOT - HARRAH’S HOTEL AND CASINO - MORNING
Wells looks back at the hotel. He sees two red-tailed hawks
perched on a balcony rail. They drop in unison and then rise
on a warm draft. Wells watches them rise and rise.
DISSOLVE TO:
ONE WHITE ROSES...
INT. SEDAN DE VILLE - DAY
Is placed on the passenger seat of his car. Wells smoking.
Driving. Flicks ashes at the ashtray, misses by a mile.

128.
Through the glass, a familiar, neater house appears.
EXT. KAY’S HOUSE - DAY
He pulls into the driveway of Kay’s house. The car shuts off.
He gathers himself. Picks up the rose. Gets out of the car.
Hart Hubbard, pruning a bush, stops snipping.
NEIGHBOR
Kenny, I’m still worried about that
mulberry over the back fence.
An old Mulberry tree grows over the shared fence. Wells
doesn’t need to look.
WELLS
I know. Good to see you, Hart.
HART HUBBARD
Good to see you too, Kenny.
He’s at the door. He takes a breath and knocks. After a while
he hears footsteps. Then the door opens. Revealing KAY. She
looks at the single flower. At Wells.
WELLS
Can I come in?
Kay considers a beat longer than is comfortable, then steps
aside to let him in.
INT. KAY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Wells sees the pool has been fixed and filled. It sparkles.
Wells sitting at the dinette looking at Kay. She looks at him.
A golden light shines through new curtains above the sink.
KAY
I made curtains.
WELLS
The house looks great. And so do you.
Kay puts the flower in a small vase. She puts two coffee cups
on the dinette. She looks at him a moment then shakes her
head. Wells takes a cup of coffee.
WELLS (CONT’D)
I called up Carl.

129.
KAY
You called Carl?
(beat)
What’d he say?
WELLS
I think he was surprised to hear from
me. He’ll see me next week. No
promises.
KAY
Wait, you really called him?
WELLS
(beat)
No... Not yet. But I’m going to.
She starts to laugh. He starts to laugh. He reaches out his
hand to hold hers across the table. They look at each other.
Goddamn.

WELLS (CONT’D)

And then they laugh at the absurdity of it all, of life, of
trying to make sense of any of it.
KAY
Oh, some stuff came for you. Some
mail.
She goes and finds a grocery bag of stuff that’s come for him.
He dumps it on the table, searching past catalogues and timeshare opportunities, until he finds what he’s looking for:
A FOREIGN ENVELOPE
Thin and light blue with PAR AVION stamped on it.
Wells looks at it. He looks at Kay. Then he takes out a small
pocket knife, uses the short blade to slice it open.
He extracts... an old napkin.
THE NAPKIN.
The one he and Acosta signed in the jungle. He unfolds it.
He reads:
Prove ‘em all wrong.
“50-50”
Whatever it takes...

130.
Followed by two faded signatures: Kenny Wells & Mike Acosta.
He stares at Mike’s signature a long moment, remembering.
KAY (CONT’D)
What? What is it?
ALSO IN THE ENVELOPE -- A DEPOSIT SLIP
$82,000,000
In his name, at THE FIRST BANK OF GIBRALTAR, exactly half what
Acosta sold, fifty percent.
He looks up at Kay mysteriously.
And he smiles.
