We HEAR A LOW-END RUMBLE.

1.

Like the GROWL OF AN UNSEEN BEAST.

Superimpose titles:
NOVEMBER 6th, 1983
HAWKINS, INDIANA
1

EXT. HAWKINS - SKY - NIGHT 1
FADE UP on the night sky.

1

Dark clouds swallow the stars.

WE TILT DOWN to find an IMPOSING BUILDING, sitting alone in a
dense woods. Superimpose titles:
HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

INT. HAWKINS LABS - SUB-LEVEL CORRIDOR

We are now inside the laboratory... SLOWLY CREEPING down a
long windowless corridor toward a STEEL DOOR. Fluorescent
lights flicker... a SIREN WARBLES... And we continue to HEAR
that LOW-END RUMBLE...
We DRAW CLOSER to the door... and closer... and...
WHOOM!

THE DOOR EXPLODES OPEN.

A SCIENTIST staggers out.

THE HINGES SHRIEKING.

Terrified.

He sprints down the corridor.

Running for his life.

Faster, faster, faster -3

INT. HAWKINS LABS - SUB-LEVEL CORRIDOR & ELEVATOR
He rounds a corner.

3

Up ahead: a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.

He mashes the CALL BUTTON. As he waits for the elevator to
arrive, he keeps looking back over his shoulder... down that
long corridor. Terrified.
The elevator arrives.

The doors grind vertically open.

The scientist leaps inside. He hits the button for the top
floor. As he waits for the doors to close, he hears:
A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE.

COMING FROM ABOVE HIM.

He looks up at the ceiling.

His eyes grow wide and --

WATCH THROUGH THE FLICKERING LIGHTS AS THE SCIENTIST IS
SUCKED UP TOWARD THE CEILING BY SOMETHING. HIS LEGS KICK
VIOLENTLY IN MID-AIR AND HE SCREAMS IN HORROR AND THEN -The elevator doors snap shut.

EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
HISS!

LAWN SPRINKLERS kick on.

We are now in a 1980s SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC.
We HEAR the VOICE OF A YOUNG BOY.

Quiet.

Calm.

Dramatic, intense.

MIKE (V.O.)
Do you hear that? Listen...
We FOCUS on a TWO-STORY HOUSE at the end of the cul-de-sac.
The mailbox reads: "THE WHEELERS."
MIKE (V.O.)
... Something is coming...
something hungry for blood...

INT. WHEELER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

5

A GROUP OF BOYS, 12 years old, play DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.
They sit around a CARD TABLE. A GRID MAP is spread out on
the table before them, along with a nearly empty pizza box,
canned Cokes, and the all-important DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
MONSTER MANUAL.
MIKE WHEELER, 12, is the "Dungeon Master" and de facto leader
of our group.
MIKE (CONT'D)
... A shadow grows on the wall
behind you... swallowing you in
darkness... it is almost here...
The other boys lean forward.

Riveted.

We survey them:

LUCAS SINCLAIR, 12, playing as a knight. He is very small
but his loud mouth more than makes up for it.
DUSTIN HENDERSON, 12, playing as a dwarf. He is the most
fearful -- and least confident -- of our group.
WILL BYERS, 12, playing as a wizard.
gentle, delicate.

He is soft-spoken,

DUSTIN
What if it's the Demogorgon? We're
in deep shit if it's the Demogorgon -LUCAS
It's not the Demogorgon --

Mike waits for them to settle down.

Then:

MIKE
An army of Troglodytes charge into
the chamber!
He slams SIX WINGED MINIATURES onto the map.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Their tails drum the floor.
Boom! Boom!

Boom!

DUSTIN
Troglodytes?!
Toldja.
Pfff.

LUCAS
DUSTIN

Mike looks over his shoulder.

His eyes grow wide.

MIKE
Wait... do you hear that? Boom!
Boom! BOOM! That sound... it
didn't come from the Troglodytes.
No. It came from something else...
Mike slams a LARGE TWO-HEADED MONSTER MINIATURE onto the map.
MIKE (CONT'D)
THE DEMOGORGON.
The boys stare.
DUSTIN
We're in deep shit.
MIKE
Will, your action.

God, he wishes it wasn't his turn.

WILL
I -- I don't know -LUCAS
Fireball him -WILL
I'd have to roll thirteen or higher -Too risky.

DUSTIN
Cast a protection spell --

LUCAS
Don't be a wimp!

Fireball him!

DUSTIN
Protection spell -- !
MIKE
The Demogorgon is tired of your
silly human bickering. It stomps
toward you. BOOM!
LUCAS
FIREBALL HIM WILL!
MIKE
Another step. BOOM!
DUSTIN
Cast protection!
MIKE
It roars in anger -LUCAS
Fireball -- !
And -FIREBALL!

DUSTIN
Protection -MIKE

Will rolls the dice. Too hard. The dice scatters to the
other side of the basement. It lands by the basement steps.
LUCAS
What is it?!

I don't know!

The boys scramble to look at the dice when -WHOOM! The basement door swings open. The boys look up to
find KAREN WHEELER, late 30s, Mike's mom, standing at the top
of the stairs.
MIKE
Mom, we're in the middle of a
campaign -KAREN
You mean the end.
She taps her watch.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Fifteen after.

Mike chases his mom up out of the basement.
MIKE
Just twenty more minutes -KAREN
It's a school night, Michael, and I
just put Holly to bed. You can
finish next weekend -MIKE
That'll ruin the flow -Michael --

KAREN

MIKE
I'm serious, Mom! It took two
weeks to plan. How was I supposed
to know it'd take ten hours -- ?
KAREN
You've been playing ten hours?
Mike's dad, TED, 45, is watching TV. Or trying to. The
signal is terrible; a snowstorm of STATIC obscures the image.
He smacks the TV.

The static flares.

Lucas, Dustin, and Will stuff belongings into backpacks.
WILL
Does the seven count?
LUCAS
(shit)
It was a seven?
Will nods.
LUCAS (CONT'D)
Did Mike see it?
Will shakes his head.
LUCAS (CONT'D)
Then it doesn't count.
The boys zip up their backpacks and race up the stairs.
Dustin holds up the pizza box.

Still one slice left.

DUSTIN
Hey guys -- anyone want this?!
No!

LUCAS/WILL

Dustin looks back at the pizza.

Considers.

INT. WHEELER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dustin heads upstairs, pizza box in arms. He walks up to a
bedroom door. Through a crack in the door, he sees...
NANCY WHEELER. This is Mike's sister, 16, girl-next-door
pretty. She is on her bed in pajamas, a phone in hand,
fingers twisting its cord, slender legs kicked in the air.

Dustin waves, getting her attention.

Holds up the pizza box.

DUSTIN
Hey Nancy, there's a slice left if
you want. Pepperoni and sausage -NANCY
(into phone)
Hold on -Nancy walks over and -SHUTS THE DOOR in Dustin's face.

EXT./INT. WHEELER GARAGE - NIGHT
WHOOM!

Dustin shuts the garage door behind him.

He's in the middle of eating the last pizza slice. The other
three boys are out here already: Lucas and Will are climbing
onto their bikes; Mike is seeing them off.
DUSTIN
(talking with mouth full)
Something's wrong with your sister.
MIKE
What're you talking about?
DUSTIN
She's got a stick up her butt -LUCAS
It's 'cause she's seeing that barf
bag, Steve Harrington -DUSTIN
Yeah, she's turning into a real
jerk.
MIKE
She's always been a real jerk -Dustin climbs onto his bike.
DUSTIN
Nu-uh. She used to be cool. Like
that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Eldertree campaign -(CONTINUED)

Dustin and Lucas bike off out of the garage.
Will lingers behind a second longer.

Turns back to Mike.

What?

MIKE

WILL
The roll. It was a seven.
Demogorgon -- it got me.

See you tomorrow.

Will smiles at Mike, then bikes away, joining the others.
BZZZZZ.

The light in the garage flicks.

Strange.

Mike switches it off and heads back inside.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

The boys bike home. Their handlebar lights wink in the
night. And good thing, because it's very dark out here.
Lucas peels off from the group.
LUCAS
See ya, ladies.
DUSTIN
Kiss your mom 'night for me.
Lucas flips him the bird and bikes up a driveway towards a
TWO-STORY HOUSE. It looks almost identical to Mike's.
Will and Dustin bike on in silence for a beat, then:
DUSTIN (CONT'D)
Race to my place? Winner gets a
comic?
Any comic?

He starts pedaling.

Hey!

Dustin pedals in pursuit.

But he's already behind.

And...

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

11

Will whizzes past a house at the far end of neighborhood.
He waves at Dustin.

Now fifty yards back.

WILL
I'll take your "X-Men" one-threefour!
Dustin stops.

Out-of-breath.

DUSTIN
(really bummed)
... Man.
12

EXT. FOREST ROAD - LATER - NIGHT

12

Will is now biking along an empty forest road.

All alone.

He lives much further out than the rest of his friends. It
is even darker out here and quiet; unnervingly so. Only the
SOUND of CICADAS and a gentle breeze to keep him company.
He bikes past a LARGE METAL FENCE.

A warning sign reads:

HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY.
RESTRICTED AREA. NO TRESPASSING.
His bike's headlight flickers. Will looks down at it. After
a beat, the light returns to normal. He looks back up and -A TALL FIGURE STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.
Will yanks the handle bars -- loses control -He veers off the road -- explodes into -13

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

13

And CRASHES. Will flies off the bike. He skids, rolls, eats
dirt. As he lies there on the ground, gasping, he hears:
STRANGE GUTTURAL SOUNDS.

COMING FROM BEHIND HIM.

He pushes to his feet and turns to the sound. Foliage
shudders. The SOUNDS GROW. Something is coming.
Will abandons his bike -And runs.
14

EXT. BYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

14

Will bursts out of the woods.

Up ahead: his HOUSE.

It is small, one story, lower class, falling apart.
15

INT. BYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

15

Will slams the door shut behind him and bolts the lock.
A shaggy dog, CHESTER THE MUTT, races to greet him.
WILL
JONATHAN?!

MOM?!

He checks his MOM'S BEDROOM.
No one is home.
16

MOM?!
His BROTHER'S BEDROOM.

He is all alone.

INT. BYERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

16

Will scrambles back to the living room window.
He cups his hands to the glass and peers out into the yard.
It is dark.

Murky.

Quiet.

A gust of wind blows and...

Day-old laundry flutters on a clothes line to REVEAL...
THAT FIGURE AGAIN. JUST STANDING THERE AMONGST THE BILLOWING
LAUNDRY. WE CAN'T MAKE OUT ANY FEATURES, BUT ITS PROPORTIONS
SEEM... OFF. ITS HEAD IS TOO LARGE. ITS ARMS ARE TOO LONG.
ITS BODY IS SWOLLEN AND BENT IN A STRANGE, TWISTED SHAPE.
Another gust of wind.

The clothes flutters again and...

The Figure is gone.
Will pales.
17

His heart in his throat.

INT. BYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Will rips the phone receiver off the kitchen wall.
911. But -It does not ring.

Just hums with LOW-END STATIC.

Hello?!

WILL
HELLO -- ?!

Will pauses. He HEARS SOMETHING on the other line. But not
a voice... it is that GUTTURAL SOUND he heard in the woods.
The pitch rises and falls, making a series of strange sounds.
Words? It is as if the figure... whoever... whatever it
is... is somehow speaking to him through the phone receiver.
Behind him, Chester begins to GROWL at the front door.
Will lowers the phone.

And looks back at the door.

A SHADOW fills the crack at the base of the door.
And then somehow, impossibly, the chain bolt begins to slide
open, as if drawn by an invisible hand. The metal SHRIEKS.
Will drops the phone and -18

EXT. BYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT
WHOOM!

18

Will explodes out the back screen door.

He sprints into an OLD WOODEN SHED and -19

INT. BYERS SHED - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
WHAM!

He slams the shed doors behind him.

His eyes dart.

19
Breathing hard.

Searching for something.

The shed is cluttered and dark, lit only by a NAKED LIGHT
BULB, hanging from the ceiling. The bulb buzzes, flickers.
At last he spots it:
AN OLD REMINGTON RIFLE.

DUSTY.

HANGING ON A WALL MOUNT.

Will yanks it down, retrieves a few AMMO SHELLS from a work
bench, and loads the rifle as fast as he can, which isn't
very fast at all; he is so scared his hands sweat and shake.
Will finishes loading the rifle. He snaps the chamber shut
and aims it at the door. The rifle trembles in his hands.
While Will keeps his eyes trained on the door, we notice a
SHADOWED FIGURE SLOWLY RISE behind him.
Will senses movement.
He just stares.

Turns.

He doesn't fire.

Paralyzed by fear.

Shock.

He fights tears.

EXT. HOPPER'S TRAILER - MORNING

21

Hopper steps out onto a decrepit porch.
He lights up a HAND-ROLLED CIGARETTE.

Drags on it.

His trailer is perched on the shore of a lake. It's a bit
lonely out here. But damn if it isn't beautiful.
Hop rubs his arms.
22

Getting cold.

Enough beauty for now.

INT. HOPPER'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER - MORNING
- Hopper showers.

22

So tiny in here his body barely fits.

- Hopper studies his beard in the mirror.
Doesn't.

Considers shaving.

- Hopper pops open a PLASTIC VIAL labeled "TUINAL." He
shakes out two capsules. Red and blue. Scoops a mouthful of
water. Washes them down.
23

INT. HOPPER'S TRAILER - BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER - MORNING

23

Hopper dresses. He yanks on a pair of brown pants... a
matching brown collared shirt... a belt with a holster... a
9MM GLOCK... a gray hat... and lastly, he clips on...
A GOLD BADGE.

It reads:
HAWKINS POLICE.

CHIEF.

Behind him, the TV continues to drones...
LOCAL NEWSWOMAN (ON TV)
... In other news, it seems like
you may want to stay in tonight -or pack an umbrella. Let's go now
to everyone's favorite morning
weatherman, Charles. Charles?
Hopper heads out the door.

The trailer door RATTLES shut.

second, realizing something. She turns back to Jonathan.

It is chaos over here.

Mike is grabbing syrup from a cabinet; Nancy is eating
scrambled eggs, HOLLY, 3, is crying; Ted is watching the

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - BACK - MORNING

As the boys slot their wheels into bike racks, they look
around at all the kids streaming in. Looking for Will.
MIKE

Weird.

LUCAS
I'm telling you: his mom's right,
he just went to class early again -DUSTIN
Yeah -- he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him a pop quiz.
Mike nods.

Feeling better.
TROY (O.S.)
Step right up, ladies and
gentlemen! Step right up and get
your tickets for the freak show!

The boys look to find two kids, JAMES and TROY, 14, headed
toward them. Our boys don't run... they just stand there
like statues. This is clearly a regular occurrence, and this
is how they deal with it: with passivity.
Troy sizes them up.
TROY (CONT'D)
Who do you think would make more
money at a freak show: "Frogface,"
"Midnight," or "Toothless?"
JAMES

Because Dustin has no collar bones, his arms stretch all the
way across.
The bullies share disgusted looks, shiver...
TROY
Gets me every time!

Every time!

They shove past our boys and head into the school, laughing.
LUCAS

growing bright, then dim, then bright, then dim, then -WHOOM.
