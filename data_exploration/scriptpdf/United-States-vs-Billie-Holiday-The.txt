INT. TBD JANKY APARTMENT/RADIO STATION - NIGHT

BILLIE, strung out, but dressed to the nines, forces a smile
as she sits for an interview with REGINALD LORD DEVINE - an
aging white gossip columnist. Think Skip E. Lowe. MISS
FREDDY, her devoted stylist, stands by watching.
Reginald grabs an item from his bar, sets it on his desk next
to the recorder, then places the microphone on top of it.
REGINALD DEVINE
I’m going to put this up here so I
can get both of us.
Reginald then starts recording. Reginald and Billie both have
drinks.
REGINALD DEVINE (CONT'D)
My next guest has played Broadway.
She’s sold out Carnegie Hall. She
played in Hollywood movies opposite
the likes of Louis Armstrong. I am
Reginald Lord Devine - and oh my
god. Oh my god. I can’t believe we
have the opportunity to interview,
as I live and breathe, the legend,
the lady, my hero - Miss Billie
Holiday, Miss Lady Day. Which do
you prefer, honey?
FREDDY
She’d prefer you pay her her money
first.
Reginald grabs the cash from his desk drawer, hands it over
to Freddy.

22
REGINALD DEVINE
(apologetically to Freddy)
Here you go.
Freddy eyes the money. It’s all there. He nods to Billie.
REGINALD DEVINE (CONT'D)
Tell me, tell me - what’s it like
being a Colored woman?
Billie and Freddy exchange a look.
FREDDY
(rolling his eyes)
Jesus.
BILLIE
Would you ask Doris Day a question
like that?
REGINALD DEVINE
Well, Doris Day’s not colored,
silly.
(then)
I wanna talk Strange Fruit. Yes our
audience wants to know. Strange
Fruit. You keep getting in trouble
for it. And you’re so determined to
keep singing it. Why?
(laughs)
Trouble maker.
BILLIE
You ever seen a lynching? It’s
about human rights. You know? The
government forgets that. They just
want me to shut up and sing All Of
Me.

EXT./INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT

VO 2

Billie performs ALL OF ME, looking beautiful in her red gown.
As Jimmy enters the club and we meet the usual suspects Monroe, Glaser etc.
REGINALD DEVINE (V.O.)
Let’s start where it all began at
the Cafe Society. You know I loved
that place.
(MORE)

32
REGINALD DEVINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I remember seeing Lena Horne
tipping in with... who? Who was it?
Oh yeah, with that drunk Tallulah
Bankhead. That’s the first time I
saw you sing, honey. Mesmerizing.
Oh, and everybody was there.
(laughs)
The wrong kinda place for the right
kinda people.
FREDDY (V.O.)
(snidely)
Like Jimmy Fletcher.
BILLIE (V.O.)
Leave him alone. He didn’t know
what he was walking into.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Yes he did.
(snide)
Soldier boy.
REGINALD DEVINE (V.O.)
You were with that famous manager
back then. What was his name?
FREDDY (V.O.)
Crook.
They all laugh.
BILLIE (V.O.)
Yeah, crooked ass Joe Glaser. He
was there with my husband Monroe.
Billie finishes singing ALL OF ME.
BILLIE
Your goodbyes left me with eyes
that cried,
How can I go on dear without you,
You took the best, so why not take
the rest.
Baby, take all of me.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY, BILLIE’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER - FEBRUARY3
1947
Backstage after the set. Her generously-sized dressing room
is shabby but chic; Billie’s the center of attention.
Champagne flows as the elegant creme of the crowd rub elbows.

42
Joe Glaser, her trusted manager (30’s) and white, rudely
instructs A PHOTOGRAPHER where to snap photos. Billie smiles
graciously. ROSLYN, 30s, with an eye patch, is her
hairdresser. She whispers -ROSLYN
Orson Welles is outside, he wants
to see you again.
Billie looks around to see if her husband’s watching. Then,
whispers back -BILLIE
Tell him tomorrow. Monroe’s leaving
town.
That said, Roslyn speaks in her usual loud voice.
ROSLYN
You got some fans in from Baltimore
that wanna see you.
Billie smiles, nods her approval.

Jimmy, awkward, way in the back of the crowd, tries to get a
glimpse of the famous Lady Day. As he inches closer, he’s
stopped by Billie’s husband, MONROE, 30s, black and rugged.
MONROE
And who are you?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Jimmy Fletcher.
MONROE
She don’t know you, soldier-boy.
Keeping Jimmy at bay, he turns his attention back to Billie.

INT. BILLIE’S DRESSING ROOM - FEBRUARY 1947

Roslyn introduces this awestruck poor black couple.
ROSLYN
Come on y’all, meet Lady Day.
Billie ever the queen greets them warmly. They share a common
look. Poor people recognize poor people. The man can barely
speak he’s so in awe.
WORKING CLASS MAN
Hello Miss Holiday.

52
BILLIE
Call me Billie.
The man too overwhelmed to talk, tears up.
WORKING CLASS WOMAN
We love you.
BILLIE
You’re sweet. You came all the way
from Baltimore to see me?
WORKING CLASS WOMAN
(beaming)
Yes ma’am. And he’s gone take me to
a fancy dinner too.
BILLIE
Geewhiz, I’m from Baltimore! Come
on, have some champagne.
(smiles)
Now you make sure he takes you to
Jimmy’s Chicken Shack up in Harlem.
That’s some good eating.
Through the crowd, Jimmy catches Billie’s eye and she gives
him the briefest smile. Monroe sees this and slams the door
in Jimmy’s face.

INT. FLETCHER HOME - SAME TIME - FEBRUARY 1947

7

Jimmy rushes into a lavish living room. He heads towards the
dining room, finding his mother, MRS. FLETCHER, late 50s,
regal, seated alone at the head of the table.
Jimmy kisses his mother on the cheek and quickly sits. Mrs.
Fletcher is not happy that he’s late and Jimmy knows it.
JIMMY
Sorry, mom. I was on a job
interview.
Mrs. Fletcher never looking up from her plate, knows he’s
lying.
MRS. FLETCHER
What job interviews are at 8:30 on
a Sunday evening, James? Your lies
are unbecoming and I’m getting
tired of it...
(disgusted)
Living off your father’s hard
earned trust.
(then)
(MORE)

62
MRS. FLETCHER (CONT'D)
You know I disdain tardiness.
Sunday dinners all we have together
now that you’ve moved out.
JIMMY
I was downtown interviewing for
this writer’s position at The Sun
News. Had to go to the editor’s
home. I got the job, mom.
Mrs. Fletcher eyes him, deciding whether or not he’s telling
the truth. She wants to believe him.
MRS. FLETCHER
Your father would turn in his grave
with all that he accomplished.
JIMMY
Mom, please.
Mrs. Fletcher searches into her son’s eyes.
MRS. FLETCHER
You’re not fooling nobody walking
around in that uniform. Just
because I don’t hang in the gutter
with your friends, doesn’t mean I
don’t know what’s going on, James.
(then)
You’re hanging out with those jazz
musicians in them clubs and god
knows what else.
Jimmy stands and hugs her from behind. He gives her a kiss on
the cheek. We see they are close.
JIMMY
I do hang out at some jazz clubs. I
even met Billie Holiday.
This brightens Mrs. Fletcher’s mood. She’s intrigued.
MRS. FLETCHER
Really?!
Jimmy knows how to play his mother.
JIMMY
Yes, really. You should be
congratulating me on my new job. I
start tomorrow. I can finally get
out of this uniform.

72
MRS. FLETCHER
I love that you’re writing, James.
I hear that Billie Holiday is quite
the lady.
JIMMY
I hear just the opposite. I don’t
think she’s a lady.
MRS. FLETCHER
Those are just rumors. Anytime
somebody colored is doing something
right, they paint us out wrong.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - AFTERNOON - FEBRUARY 1947

Monroe sternly watches Billie as he eats his lunch: a napkin
tucked in his collar, his pork chops and whiskey.
A TRUE ROMANCE COMIC BOOK - Billie’s beautifully manicured
hands holding it as she reads.
HER CIGARETTE SMOKE curling over the top of the book.
She’s wearing slacks and heels, with her feet up on the
table. Her lovely face, animated by what’s she’s reading.
It’s too early in the day for the club to be open for
business, but Billie and her team are working.
MISS FREDDY, 40s the man in charge of Billie’s outfits, has
TWO EVENING GOWNS for her to consider. But Billie doesn’t
seem to have noticed.
JOE GLASER meticulously watches over the musicians.
ON STAGE The great LESTER “PREZ” YOUNG, late 30s, shy, on saxophone,
jamming with an AUDITIONING SAX PLAYER.
BILLIE
Prez, honey, from the top.
LESTER YOUNG
Sure, Lady.
They start back in, but it’s not sounding great.
A WAITER brings Billie a freshly cooked steak on a plate.
Billie directs the Waiter to put the food on the floor. ANGLE
ON MISTER - Billie’s boxer-dog, happy eating the meat on the
plate.

82
IN BILLIE’S LAP - her chihuahua CHIQUITA, contentedly eating
treats out from Lady’s hand. She talks to him.
BILLIE
Now roll over.
The chihuahua rolls over. The boxer stops eating and rolls
over too. Billie chuckles.
MISS FREDDY
You got him rolling round in your
crotch.
MONROE
(nonplussed)
It’s a damn circus act in here.
Nobody pays attention to him.
MISS FREDDY
Vogue Magazine wants to interview
me. About your gowns and such.
MONROE
You ain’t giving no interview to no
magazine. Someone wants to hear
about her they can come talk to me.
Miss Freddy rolls his eyes.

Billie just ignores Monroe.

MISS FREDDY
(re: the dresses)
They sent these over.
BILLIE
I’ll take both of them.
MONROE
They’ll cost me an arm and a leg!
MISS FREDDY
Shut the fuck up, Monroe.
BILLIE
Miss Freddy? Let’s send the
dressmaker one of my husband’s
arms.
Folks crack up at that. Monroe’s been put in his place.
Now it’s time to give her attention to the auditioning
musician. Joe Glaser is wondering what she thinks. Billie
listens a beat. Then -

92
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Joe, he ain’t clicking.
JOE GLASER
Ok, man, thanks for coming in.
The Sax Player is crestfallen. He nods thanks to Billie,
packs up, leaves.
Monroe, reclaiming Billie’s attention, waves a newspaper
article in her face.
MONROE
Take a look.
A QUARTER-PAGE ADVERTISEMENT: “Come Hear Lady Day sing
“Strange Fruit” at CAFE SOCIETY.”
BILLIE
(smiles)
Looks good.
MONROE
They should be running half-page
ads at least. Plus, you should be
getting a bigger cut of the door.
Shit, you’re practically topping
the DOWN BEAT poll. Shit, even
Eleanor Roosevelt has to pull
strings to get in here.
BILLIE
You got a point. Glaser?
Joe Glaser lights a reefer. Never looking up from his
paperwork.
JOE GLASER
I’m working on it.
MONROE
When she started here she was a
nobody and now she’s a star.
JOE GLASER
I’m working on it, ok?
BILLIE
(to calm Monroe)
Joe’s working on it.
This seems to calm Monroe.

10

Eyeing the newspaper again, Billie flips it over to the side
Monroe didn’t show her. Sure enough, there’s something:
A PHOTOGRAPH of HARRY J. ANSLINGER, looking handsome,
pinstripe suited, seated at a bank of microphones.
THE CAPTION: “Harry Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, testifies to Congress this week.”
HEADLINE above the NEWS STORY: “Anslinger Promises Results.”
BILLIE’S FACE, studying Anslinger’s photograph.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(cutting, to Monroe)
Your friend’s in the paper.
MONROE
He ain’t no friend of mine.
BILLIE
Sure he is. Glaser’s friend too.
Monroe doesn’t answer that. Billie eyes them both up, wants
to believe them but isn’t completely sold. Glaser ignores
her, now glancing at the SET LIST.
At the bottom of the list of songs, Glaser has crossed off
“Strange Fruit.” He hands it to Billie:
MONROE
I cut Strange Fruit.
BILLIE
NO! I want to sing the damn song.
The club advertises it and people
want to hear it.
JOE GLASER
And I’ve told you a hundred times,
people in high places don’t want
you singing that song.
BILLIE
And I’ve asked you one hundred
times, what people?
Joe shrugs. Looks at Monroe for help here.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Don’t look over to him. I’m talking
to you. You work for me.

11

JOE GLASER
I’m busting my ass out there for
you kid. Why do you have to make
this shit so difficult for me?
(then, finally)
The Government.
Billie knew it all along.
BILLIE
Yeah, “the government.” People like
your buddy Anslinger, right?
MONROE
Quit it with that, huh?
BILLIE
That song means a lot to me.
JOE GLASER
Meeropol wrote it and he’s a god
damn Commie.
BILLIE
I don’t care.
(determined)
I’m making a statement about my
people.
JOE GLASER
Come on Lady.

MONROE
You’re not singing it.

BILLIE
I’ll sing what I want.
Monroe looks at Lester Young.
MONROE
You put her up to this?
LESTER YOUNG
If Lady wants to sing the song MISS FREDDY
Nigga, it’s giving a face to all
them young boys being lynched!
MONROE
Mind your business Freddy.
(bullying Billie)
We ain’t going over this again.
Monroe looks as if he’s about to hit her. Joe Glaser turns
away, not in the mood for this.

12

Billie takes another look at the newspaper then at Joe and
Monroe.
BILLIE
If you all ain’t Anslinger’s
friends then how come you both
always be sitting with him?
JOE GLASER
We don’t sit with him. He sits with
us.
MONROE
What do you expect us to do? Run
from him? He’s a FED. We’re trying
to protect your ass.
BILLIE
(looks him in the eyes)
Please don’t lie to me Monroe. I
feel alone when you do.
MONROE
I’m not lying.
Monroe grabs her, kisses her. A little too rough. Billie
doesn’t mind it at all. People turn their heads. It’s a
little uncomfortable.
MONROE (CONT'D)
I swear.
JOE GLASER
It’s for your own good, ok?
Lester’s pissed that she gave in. They both know the effect
that Monroe and Glaser have on her. Billie’s sorry she’s
letting Lester down.
LESTER
Fuck the feds and fuck Anslinger.
Lester walks out.

CONGRESSMAN JOHN E. RANKIN and CONGRESSMAN J. PARNELL THOMAS
sit annoyed with SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY
CONGRESSMAN JP THOMAS
I wish I got me a Roy Cohn.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Gentleman, you have to help me get
this budget pushed through
congress.
CONGRESSMAN JP THOMAS
We just increased your budget last
year. Why is this so important to
you, Harry?
HARRY ANSLINGER
Drugs and niggers are a
contamination to our great American
civilization!
Anslinger gives his files to Senator McCarthy’s assistant,
ROY COHN to pass out to the men.
CONGRESSMAN JOHN E. RANKIN
That’s why we helped you in the
first place.
HARRY ANSLINGER
When the niggers use drugs they
forget their place. They defy
us. That’s why this Holiday woman
must be stopped. She sings this
Strange Fruit song and it’s causing
a lot of people to think ...the
wrong way. We’ve got the husband in
the bag. But she won’t stop singing
it.
Roy Cohn looks to Senator McCarthy for permission to talk.
ROY COHN
Excuse me sir, might I add
something.
Senator McCarthy nods okay.
ROY COHN (CONT'D)
People are calling the song a
musical starting gun for a so
called civil rights movement.

14

CONGRESSMAN JP THOMAS
So what are your plans? You can’t
arrest her for singing a song.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Yes I can. She’s inciting a riot.
ROY COHN
That’s a misdemeanor at best.
(smiles)
She’s a drug addict though.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Exactly.
CONGRESSMAN JOHN E. RANKIN
Go after that bitch on the drugs.

A SPOON FILLED WITH HEROIN, HELD OVER A FLAME - as Billie
cooks up her fix.
BILLIE
Joe Guy, I came down here for you
to save my ass.
JOE GUY, 20s, black, young and recklessly handsome unstraps
his belt tied around his arm. He’s already shot up. He grabs
for his trumpet. Plays a killer tune. Billie hums along. She
smiles. He makes her happy.
JOE GUY
You don’t need me to do that. Shit,
Lady, you can do that all by
yourself.
Billie, her vein bulging, and her arm tied with a stocking,
fills the shared syringe and shoots up.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT - APRIL 1947

ON STAGE - Billie in her beautiful gown with her radiant
smile. She commands the stage and the mixed raced audience.
This time mostly made up of American soldiers. And they are
loud! Jimmy Fletcher watches.
Monroe sits next to Harry Anslinger. THE AUDIENCE - a throng
of radiant fans.

15

For the first time, Anslinger sees Billie up close. He takes
in every detail of her person, her dress, her hair, her
jewelry, her figure.
ON STAGE - LOUIS ARMSTRONG on trumpet, BOBBY TUCKER, late
20s, on piano and Billie, in fine form, smiles. She has to
practically scream over the crowd.
BILLIE
Here we are! Beautiful little show!
Billie yells out to a group of loud soldiers in the back.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(loud)
Can you hear me over there?
(beat)
Cause I can hear you.
Everyone laughs. They immediately quiet down. She can control
any audience.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Say hi to Louis Armstrong
everybody!
Louis nods. The audience applauds like crazy for them.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
We’re recording a V-disk, for all
of our men and women in the
service, and that makes tonight all
the more special.
(sincere)
You all are fighting a real fight
out there. We love you for it.
Don’t we Louis?
LOUIS ARMSTRONG
(smiles)
Yes Lady!
Folks cheer, and Jimmy joins them. Monroe applaud politely.
Anslinger looks around, not liking what he sees. Billie’s
patriotism, and her fans, white and black, some wealthy, many
working class, all loving her. Lots of SOLDIERS IN UNIFORM,
of all colors, cheering her on.
FROM THE BANDSTAND - Billie sees, Anslinger and Monroe
sitting together again. Monroe is in deep conversation with
Anslinger. She is sucker punched by this. Billie finally
catches Monroe’s attention. She smiles at him, hiding her
feelings of betrayal.

16

BILLIE
(to Louis Armstrong)
I feel lonely, Louis. How about we
try, “SOLITUDE”.
Louis throws his famous smile.
LOUIS ARMSTRONG
Anything for you, Lady.
She counts the other MUSICIANS in. Eyeing Monroe and
Anslinger she sings.
BILLIE
(singing)
In my solitude, you haunt me, with
dreadful ease, of days gone by, in
my solitude, you taunt me, with
memories, that never die...
The audience in rapt attention.

You could hear a pin drop.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(singing)
...I sit in my chair, and filled
with despair, there's no one could
be so sad, with gloom everywhere I
sit, and I stare, I know that I'll
soon go mad...
Monroe shifts uncomfortably. Anslinger’s poker face softens
under her spell. Jimmy Fletcher is spellbound.
Anslinger, leaning forward now, his eyes enchanted, something
deep within him stirring. Uncertain of what to do with
himself, he wipes his face with his hand.

INT./EXT. BILLIE’S DRESSING ROOM, CAFE SOCIETY - ANOTHER
NIGHT - APRIL 1947
The crush of friends is long gone.

Billie, high and alone.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR Miss Freddy sits. Jimmy approaches with some flowers. Miss
Freddy looks him up and down, greedy.
MISS FREDDY
What you looking for?
JIMMY
Is the lady around?

MISS FREDDY
So you finally struck up the nerve
to come see her?
He calls for Billie.
Billie?
Yeah?

MISS FREDDY (CONT'D)
BILLIE

MISS FREDDY
Lady, this writer nigga wants to
see you.
BILLIE
Send him back.
MISS FREDDY
You better not be one of those
gossip people.
(to Billie)
I’m gonna go get something to eat.
As Jimmy peeks in. Billie tries to move her drug works out of
sight.
BILLIE
No uniform tonight, soldier boy?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Hi.
BILLIE
You here all the time Jimmy
Fletcher.
Jimmy is surprised that she remembered his name. Smiles.
comes into the room. Hands her the flowers.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Great show tonight.
BILLIE
And now it’s quiet. I don’t like
the quiet. It’s so noisy, you know?
They stare at each other. Sexual tension.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
You don’t got a girl?

He

18

JIMMY FLETCHER
Nope. I served my time for our
country. Now, you know, hoping to
find a good job.
(re: the drugs)
Your boyfriend give you that?
Billie just smiles, the beautiful sphinx.
BILLIE
You want some?
JIMMY FLETCHER
No thanks.
BILLIE
It takes the edge off, you know.
Jimmy simply nods.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Pour yourself a drink?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Sure.
She hands him an opened bottle and a whiskey glass. He pours
for himself. She takes back the bottle. They clink bottle to
whiskey glass.
BILLIE
Cheers.
They drink.

Him from the glass, her from the bottle.

JIMMY FLETCHER
Why don’t you ever sing “Strange
Fruit”?
BILLIE
I gotta be pretty high to sing
that.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Never heard you sing it.
This lights up Billie a little.
BILLIE
It’s a song about important things
that are going on in our country. I
don’t think people know that I care
about that stuff. Most of my other
songs are only about love.

19

JIMMY FLETCHER
Love’s important too. Right?
Billie takes a moment, studying Jimmy. There’s something
interesting about this guy.
BILLIE
One day I’ll quit the drinking and
I’ll get off the junk too. Maybe
go to one of those hospitals, you
know. You know how to do the waltz?
That shit is so pretty.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yes.
You do?

BILLIE

Jimmy gives an encouraging smile. She laughs gently. He
laughs with her.
JIMMY FLETCHER
You’re funny.
BILLIE
Cause I know what you want.
Sexual tension again. They’re both enjoying it.
She gets up. Stands in front of him. She smells incredible.
Everything a man would want. She leans past him, her body
hanging above him, as she pulls something from a shelf. A 78
RECORD. LOVER MAN. She hands it graciously to him.
He looks at the cover and then at her. He’s never been this
close to someone so famous. She takes the record, signs it,
then gives it back.
Jimmy looks at the record, happy. Billie smiles.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Which one of my songs is your
favorite song?
JIMMY FLETCHER
“ALL OF ME”.
BILLIE
You like that song, huh? Well
that’ll be our song then.
Billie sings a piece of the song and begins to waltz.

20

BILLIE (CONT'D)
So you know how to waltz huh?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yes.

himself uncertainly, taking a seat. AT THE ALTAR - Billie
speaks with the PRIEST, white, 60s.
She turns to leave, genuflects, walks down the aisle with
Miss Freddy and Roslyn following. Jimmy stands to meet her.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Sorry about your loss. I lost my
father when I was young.
A tearful Billie meets his eyes, grateful for his kind
presence.
BILLIE
Chiquita sat on my lap every day.
Jimmy, confused, not sure who she’s referring to.
ROSLYN
(clarifying)
It was her dog. Her dog died.
MISS FREDDY
The little one. Not the big one.
Mister’s doing fine.
Jimmy tries to hide that he thinks they’re all crazy.

So tell me, you are pretty tight

Wait a minute, what’s Tallulah
Bankhead gotta do with Strange
Fruit? You said this interview was
a retrospective on her career. Cut
the tape off. Cut the tape off.
A terrified Reginald cuts it off.
FREDDY (CONT'D)

Listen bitch. You got one more time
to ask a smart question.
Reginald turns the tape back on.

TALLULAH BANKHEAD
Vogue Magazine wants to interview
me about you. Should I talk to
them?
BILLIE
Go head.
They pass the front desk manager, a white middle aged man.
Billie and Tallulah are unaware of his uncomfortable gaze.
Billie whispers in a sexy tone.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Just take me to your room.
They enter the elevator. A young BLACK MAN serves as the
elevator operator.
BLACK ELEVATOR MAN
Now you know I can’t let you in
here.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
James, don’t you know who this is?
BLACK ELEVATOR MAN
I know who it is Miss Bankhead. I
also know I want my job.
(quieter to Billie)
Miss Holiday the only negro allowed

BILLIE
Negro’s can’t, but a bunch bull
daggers can?
Black elevator man is sad but stands his ground. He wants his
job.
BLACK ELEVATOR MAN
(to Billie)
You gone have to take the service
elevator.
Billie looks at him defiantly. No one moves for a moment. The
front desk manager appears.
BLACK ELEVATOR MAN (CONT'D)

Miss Holiday, they killing us for
less down south. Lynching men and
women. Please don’t make no scene

INT. EARLE THEATRE - SAME TIME - MAY 1947

Billie walks onto the stage. The cops scattered throughout
the crowd don’t go unnoticed by her. Billie comes to the mic.
The crowd applauds.
She stares defiantly at the white cops. She’s radiant and
brave. They stand their ground. Her need to sing the song
trumps everything. She looks over to Lester for approval. He
nods.
BILLIE
(singing)
Southern trees bear a strange
fruit.
The audience, segregated, listening intently, hanging on to
Billie’s every word and note. Billie’s eyes meet Monroe.
She’s about to tear up but he doesn’t care. He turns to
leave. Carter smiles. He’s been waiting for this moment. He
turns to a nearby cop.
AGENT CARTER
Get her off that stage.
The cop signals his partners. Billie belts like a warrior.
BILLIE
Blood on the leaves and blood at
the root.
Jimmy Fletcher, in the colored seats cannot believe his ears.
ANGLE ON HIS NOTEBOOK Writing down her setlist, noting “Strange Fruit.” He looks
over to TWO COPS leaving the theatre to alert their
superiors. Then a group of policemen with BILLY CLUBS move
towards Billie and the band. They are coming for her. On
stage, Lester sees what’s about to go down. He stops playing.
Grabs Billie.
LESTER
We got to get the hell out of here
Lady.

But Billie won’t go. She is determined to sing.
BILLIE
Get off me, Prez.
On cue, the rest of her band rushes her off the stage. Chaos
erupts in the crowd as the white cops frantically try to get
to them. Billie struggles unsuccessfully to stay on stage.
Fletcher takes note of all.
BILLIE (CONT'D)

I’m singing this damn song.

BILLIE
Joe, will you do me a favor and get
me some ice cream?
JOE GUY
I don’t have any ice cream.
BILLIE
Come on honey, just go to Libby’s.
It’s right around the corner. Ice
cream sounds good.
JOE GUY
What kind of ice cream you want?
BILLIE
Chocolate ice cream.

Joe tries to get up, but falls back on the couch.

Billie cracks up. Taking charge, she steadies herself, makes
sure her clothes are on correctly, goes to the door.
ANGLE ON - Billie opening the door. Then Billie sees Jimmy’s
face and badge.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Shit.
She tries to slam the door shut but Jimmy keeps the door open
with his foot.
Billie is completely dumbfounded. Even high she’s spun.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
No! Oh my God, you’re a FED.
JIMMY FLETCHER
You’re both under arrest.
Fletcher and his white partner, AGENT MCDERMOTT, 40s, hurry
into the room, followed by two uniformed policemen.
McDermott quickly handcuffs Joe Guy who doesn’t resist.
Fletcher goes after Billie. The cops ransack the apartment
for drugs.
Billie has grabbed the drugs. She’s heading into the bathroom
to get rid of them. Then, suddenly, she stops in her tracks
and turns to face Fletcher.
BILLIE
You drank with me backstage, I was
gonna kiss you, pretending you was
a solider? ... You came to my
baby’s funeral ...all the while
you’re just some fucking Fed.
The insult is wounding, but Jimmy stays on course.
JIMMY FLETCHER

Miss Holiday -BILLIE
I gave you my record.
She’s hurt but hides it well.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
You probably don’t even like my
music.

You are under arrest.
BILLIE

JIMMY FLETCHER
Empty your hands, Ma’am.
BILLIE
Suck my ass.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Give me what’s in your hand,
please.
She throws the drug-packet at him. Powder goes everywhere.
He wipes a bit off his face, examining the stuff. Sad that
he’s found heroin. Pleased that blowing his cover won’t be
in vain.
BILLIE
Just look at you. You lying black
bitch. What did I ever do to you?
Jimmy tries not to be hurt by this. He stays the course.
JIMMY FLETCHER
A police woman will be here
shortly. She’ll search you for
further evidence.
BILLIE
You wanna search me? Come on and
search me. Police bitch is only
going to feel me up.
JIMMY FLETCHER
No, Ma’am.
BILLIE
That’s what you’ve really been
wanting.
Billie brazenly strips in front of him. She holds his gaze.
Jimmy averts his eyes to the floor.

You stay in trouble with the law
Miss Holiday. You must be
embarrassed. Don’t you want to set
an example for your race like Ella
Fitzgerald or Marian Anderson?
This hurts Billie but she smiles back.
BILLIE
You know what’s funny? The people
who are the hardest on me are my
own race.
(then)
They’ve taught us to hate each
other. Addicts are people who got a
bad illness. We need help. Not no
jail time.
She heads up the steps with dignity. REVEAL JIMMY, also
heading into the courthouse.

INT. PHILADELPHIA COURTROOM - LATER - MAY 1947

Billie looks at the PUBLIC DEFENDER that’s standing. Joe
Glaser sits behind her. Her husband Monroe is nowhere to be
found.
They face the JUDGE. THE PROSECUTOR sits at the opposing
table. Jimmy, sits with Carter and Anslinger behind the
Prosecution. Anslinger nods and smiles to Joe Glaser who
quickly looks away. Billie catches it though. She can’t
believe it.
BAILIFF
The United States vs Billie
Holiday. Docket number 14234. The
honorable Judge Cullen Ganey
presiding. All rise.
Billie scans the room like a trapped bird. She sees Jimmy. He
looks away...
LATER -

Billie on the stand.
JUDGE GANEY
We need to know the whole truth
about your addiction. We want you
to help trace the drug down to its
source. Now the police found heroin
in your room at the Attucks Hotel.
Who supplies you?

Billie stays quiet.
BILLIE
Just send me to the hospital and
get this over with.
Judge Ganey has lost his patience.
JUDGE GANEY
I hereby sentence you to serve one
year and a day -BILLIE
(interrupting)
You’re sending me to jail?!
JUDGE GANEY
You will be remanded to Alderson
Women’s Prison.
She looks at her public defender shocked. It sinks in. The
realization that Glaser has truly betrayed her. She can only
plead with him.
BILLIE
You said they’d send me to a
hospital.
Both in tears now.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
You set me up. You both set me up.
I’m not going to prison!
The gavel comes down.

The verdict has been rendered.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
It’s cause I sang that damn song.
It ain’t about no drugs!
Billie turns to Joe - hurt - as she’s handcuffed by the
bailiff.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Joe you lied to me! You said
they’d send me to a hospital! Not
no jail!
(pleads)
I’ve paid you all that money! I’m
not going to no jail! Joe I trusted
you!

1947
This is where the “Colored” Agents work.
The floor fans are going full blast, trying to cool the
stuffy, dingy, fluorescent-lit basement room. The industrial
green walls need a fresh coat of paint. The over-used file
cabinets hunkered against each other. A mop and bucket linger
in the corner as if one of the men at the desks might be
called upon to take on that task.
Each desk has only the basics. A telephone, a typewriter, a
stack of folders, a coffee cup. Varying degrees of neatness.
Everything in the office looks like it’s second-hand.
ON THE WALLS - photographs of PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HARRY S. TRUMAN, DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION, J. EDGAR HOOVER, and, DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL
BUREAU OF NARCOTICS, HARRY JACOB ANSLINGER.
IN THE CORNER - A weary American Flag on a stand.
FOUR BLACK BUREAU AGENTS hard at work. Typing up reports,
making investigative phone calls, looking through
surveillance photos, filing the paperwork.
When Jimmy enters the room, the Agents stop their work and
get to their feet treating Jimmy to a standing ovation.
Jimmy accepts the praise, but ambivalence is creeping in. His
co-worker AGENT SAM WILLIAMS, 30s, lighter shade of soul and
very dapper, takes notice.

AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
Man, smile. Don’t you realize what
you’ve done? We’ve just begun the
war on drugs and you’re leading it.
JIMMY
Yes, Sam, I guess I am.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
You’re my hero, man. All of ours.
You are paving the way. Hoover and
them white boys better get ready.
Can’t nobody do it better than a
colored man if we get the
opportunity.
Off Jimmy’s smile.

INT. MRS. FLETCHER’S HOME - NIGHT - MAY 1947
Jimmy and Mrs. Fletcher are seated in the family room just
after Sunday dinner. Mrs. Fletcher yanks a newspaper from
under her seat and throws it at him. Jimmy looks down and
sees his face on the newspaper.
MRS. FLETCHER
“YOU SHOULD BE CONGRATULATING ME ON
MY NEW JOB THAT I START TOMORROW.”
You lied to me just like you lied
to Ms. Holiday.
Jimmy looks at his mother. Busted. Conflicted.
MRS. FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Why wouldn’t you tell me that
you’re working as a Federal Agent?
Jimmy is suddenly getting a headache.
JIMMY
They swear you to secrecy, mom.
MRS. FLETCHER
You could do anything with
yourself, why that?
JIMMY
Cause I didn’t want to be an
undertaker.

Harlem upside down. I wanted to
make a difference.
(then)
I’m one of the first black Federal
Agents. Ever.
MRS. FLETCHER
They’re using you. It’s not just
about the drugs. They don’t want
her singing that song. But if she
don’t sing it, who will? Ain’t no

She’s singing it for all of us.

It’s hot. Billie lays in her bed reading a comic, fanning
herself with her metal prison plate. Women prisoners walking
past her cell, can’t help but stare. One prisoner is brazen
enough to come directly up to the cell. Never looking up from
her comic, Billie throws her plate hard at the bars.
BILLIE

The frightened prisoner runs off. Billie puts her comic down.
She stares at the ceiling frustrated. Angry.

Her record is still the only one he owns. He’s studiously
reading the liner notes. Then he gets an idea.

Jimmy looks out his window. We see that fall has turned to

He smokes a cigarette. Drink in hand. “Lover Man” plays but
the record’s scratched. He doesn’t seem to notice.

INT. BLACK-OWNED NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY - LATER - NOVEMBER 194374
Miss Freddy and Jimmy sit across from each other. Jimmy can’t
believe Freddy is wearing Billie’s mink. The waitress serves
them pigs feet, macaroni and cheese, collard greens and
cornbread separate them. Both dig in.
MISS FREDDY
You paying, right?
JIMMY FLETCHER
How she doing?
MISS FREDDY
You don’t got nobody in the jail
spying on her?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Just thought I’d ask.
MISS FREDDY
I ain’t worked a day in the last
six months. You dragged me all the
way down here.
(then)
Is this official?
Jimmy nods, no.
MISS FREDDY (CONT'D)

Why’d you do it? Why’d you really
do it?
Jimmy looks down at his coffee.

JIMMY FLETCHER
(sincere)
My father told me when I was a kid
that drugs are going to be the
death of our people. I believe that
to be true.
MISS FREDDY
You need to know something real
about the person you put in jail,
one of “OUR PEOPLE”.
Jimmy looks on.
MISS FREDDY (CONT'D)
She was raped. When she was only
ten years old.
(then)
You don’t know how it is. She’s
missing something in her life. The
fix seems to fill it. She gets
with men who treat her bad. She
steals little trinkets. Looking
like a million bucks and feeling
like nothing. Hop takes pain away
but then it comes right on back.
And harder than before. Like a
hammer. And she don’t got nobody,
really. Her singing’s her life and
she gives it away to the whole
world. Shit, at the end of the
day, she don’t hurt nobody but
herself.
JIMMY FLETCHER
I’m sorry.
Miss Freddy gives him the side eye.
MISS FREDDY
Don’t be sorry for her. Cause she
ain’t sorry for her. Be sorry for
yourself.. You put Lady away like
that.
(then, pained)
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Miss Freddy finishes her pig feet.

Jimmy has presented his file full of research on drug dealers
and users. Anslinger is looking it over.
HARRY ANSLINGER
There’s nothing on Holiday.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Well how can there be? She’s in
jail.
(then)
Pardon me for asking sir but why is
that song so important to us?
HARRY ANSLINGER
Have you heard those lyrics? Hoover
says it’s UN-AMERICAN. They provoke
people in the wrong way.
JIMMY FLETCHER
(hides his mounting anger)
Sir, what do you want me to do?
HARRY ANSLINGER
You’re a good liar. Now I want you
to go down to the prison and tell
her you’re sorry. She’ll believe
you. She’s a sucker for men.
Jimmy can’t believe his ears.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yes, sir.
HARRY ANSLINGER
We’ll make sure she never gets her
cabaret license back.
Jimmy finally sees Anslinger for who he is. We end off
Jimmy’s fake smile. This is all wrong.

I won’t.
Billie ponders this all.
BILLIE
What’s your game man?
JIMMY
I thought I was doing the right
thing.
She studies his face.
BILLIE
Right thing, huh?

You look older Soldier boy.

the papers. All them nasty things
they’re saying about me.
ED FISHMAN
Tickets went on sale yesterday, and
we’re selling pretty good.
LESTER
People just wanna hear you sing,
Lady.
Billie looks over to Roslyn. Can she pull it off?
ROSLYN
Hey, why don’t you stay at
Lester’s?
LESTER
We’ll work on the numbers and
you’ll eat some of momma’s
chitlins.
BILLIE
I know what ya’ll are thinking.

I beat it this time. And I ain’t
never planning on doing that shit
again.
Billie’s so clear and determined. They all look on with pride
wanting to believe her this time.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Headlining Carnegie Hall? HOT DAMN,
Prez!!!
Ed, Roslyn and Lester continue to offer her encouragement.
Things are looking up. Billie turns from them, looking
across, her eyes feasting on the sights and sounds of her new
freedom.
She sees Jimmy.

After a beat, she smiles, gives him a wave.

Billie enters her study. Lester plays the saxophone, Bobby
Tucker at the piano. Billie stands beside them looking
through the sheet music as they play music. A maid refreshens
her drink.
Billie sings “I Cried For You,” gently finding her voice
again.
BILLIE
(singing)
I cried for you. Now it’s your
turn to cry over me.
She pauses.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
See, it’d be better if we made the
tune more of a conversation. The
guys should take their cue from you
Prez and play it, you know, like
you do. More like they’re talking
with me.
She takes a long drag of her cigarette.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
You think that’ll work?
Sure.

BOBBY TUCKER
I’m glad you’re back, lady.

BILLIE
Yeah. I’m not feeling too bad. You

Billie pauses. BOTHERED. As much as she wants to, this isn’t

request.
BILLIE
I’m going to be honest. I’m a
little nervous up here.
We hear many screaming, “We love you Lady!”
BILLIE (CONT'D)
I love you too.

This gets a big laugh from the audience. Anslinger looks

Reporters keep asking me, Why
Billie why do you do the things you
do? Why can’t you be like this
person, or that person. This is
what I tell them.
Billie nods to Lester. The band starts. She sings directly to
Anslinger, singing “Ain’t Nobody’s Business.”
BILLIE (CONT'D)

There ain’t nothin I ever do or
nothing I ever say that folks don’t
criticize me. But I’m going to do
just as I want to anyway. And I
don’t care what people say.
Fletcher nods his head, swept away.
BILLIE (CONT'D)

If I should take a notion to jump
into the ocean, ain’t nobody’s
business If I do. If I go to church
on Sunday then cabaret all day
Monday, ain’t nobody’s business If

You ain’t figuring fuck out!

He hasn’t been able to come through for her, but, he’s also
just called her on her shit.

Of course I’m high.
Roslyn and Miss Freddy look over at Lester. Like it was their

LESTER YOUNG
Look at your band waiting for you.
We’ll figure it out like we always
do. You just handle him -JOHN LEVY, 30s, mixed-race, good looking, appears from
backstage. You’d never want to be on his bad side. Just
what Billie’s looking for.
Billie and Levy lock eyes. Damn he’s sexy. Those eyes. Billie
shakes her head, flirtatious, ready for excitement.
BILLIE
Am I gonna get arrested for singing
here?
JOHN LEVY
Don’t you worry your pretty little
head about that Lady. I’ll pay off
the right people.
Billie smiles.

Finally, here’s a man with a plan.

BILLIE
You’d do that for me?
He looks her over, liking what he sees.
JOHN LEVY
You just got a standing ovation and
three curtain calls from a sold out

He traces the curve of Billie’s face, then runs his hand
along her breasts then down to her crotch. When he tries to
shove his hand between her legs, Billie takes hold of his
wrist.
JOHN LEVY (CONT'D)
You and me could be a swell team.
BILLIE
I decide when it’s time to team up
that way.
JOHN LEVY
You got divorced from Monroe,
right?
BILLIE
(flirts)
That’s none of your business. I’m
here to sing. Make you some money.
Billie does like him. And she’s thankful to him. Seeing Bobby
Tucker at the piano and Lester on stage, she goes -ON STAGE -- Billie looks incredible. The audience applauds.
She takes it all in. She sees John Levy heading to his usual
table.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(nods)
Thank you. Geewhiz, this was last
minute. Thank you everybody. I’m
going to try something new tonight.
(to Bobby and Lester)
Follow me boys.
(back to the crowd)
I’m sure y’all heard, they ain’t
given me my cabaret card back yet.
Hoots of disapproval from the audience.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
To keep working, I gotta go sing in
Washington and Philly. I don’t need
no card there. But tonight, it’s
nice to be back home.
In the audience, Roslyn and Miss Freddy. Billie starts to
sing “Them There Eyes” directly to John Levy.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(singing)
I fell in love with you the first
time I looked into them there eyes.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
And you have a certain lil cute way
of flirting with them there eyes.
Billie sings directly to -- Levy, now sitting.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(singing)
They make me feel so happy. They
make me feel so blue. I'm falling,
no stalling, in a great big way for
you.
IN THE AUDIENCE -- Levy smiles. Miss Freddy and Roslyn take
note. AT THE BAR - Agent Sam Williams. All alone. Scouting
the scene.
BILLIE (CONT'D)

My heart is jumping, you've started
something, with them there eyes.

Jimmy pulls off his headphones.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Say again.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
Tellin’ folks I’m a musician.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Make sure they don’t ask you to
play them something.
Sam plays the trumpet. Other Agents clap as he finishes.

AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
Marlines’ closed. At least I don’t

the clap no more.
The room laughs.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Got anything on Louis or Charlie?
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
Nothing that will stick. Ever feel
strange about what we are doing
Jimmy?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Sound like my mother.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS

Sam plays the trumpet again.

Stuffy White patrons crane their necks to see Billie holding
her poodle. Roslyn is at her side as they wait for a table.
ROSLYN
(loud to Maitre’D)
Qual e la cosa migliore che avete
qui da bere?
The Maitre’D gives her a cold look.
BILLIE
I told you they don’t serve no Pina
Colada’s in here, Roz.
ROSLYN
You worry about getting us paid
from that crook.
(to Maitre’D )
Ti prego, dimmi che hai la crema

MAITRE’D
One moment Miss Holiday, let me
arrange your table.
Roslyn looks up at the entrance as Levy struts in.
ROSLYN
Oh God.
Levy gives Billie a quick kiss and an envelope with cash.
JOHN LEVY
I gotta head back to the number
house.
BILLIE
Oh. Come on Levy! You said we were
eating together tonight.
JOHN LEVY
I’m sorry dahlin but I got
business. I’ll see you back at the
club.
Levy heads for the exit passing Louis McKay (40’s), good
looking, dark, and also dangerous. Billie counts the cash.
She’s short. AGAIN! Furious, she looks back at Levy but he’s
gone, replaced by McKay. He smiles at her. Billie smiles
back. That quick she’s forgotten her money problems. Roslyn
takes note.
ROSLYN
Stay away from that one Billie.
Louis McKay. Half boxer, half
pimp, all business. He’s trouble.
Music to Billie’s ears. She perks up. McKay steps up to
Billie just as the Maitre’D arrives back to seat them.
MAITRE’D
Your table is ready Miss Holiday.
Just this way.
LOUIS MCKAY
Ain’t no need for that. She’s
eating with me.
An awkward moment between them all. Then BILLIE
Well gee whiz that’s mighty swell
of you.

Come on y’all.

LOUIS MCKAY
The table’s just for two.

INT. HOTEL - DAY - APRIL 1948
A recorder and microphone are on a table pointed towards
Tallulah Bankhead. Harry Anslinger enters the room.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Good afternoon, Miss Bankhead.
Thank you for meeting me. I’m
federal agent Harry Anslinger.
Tallulah looks at him intensely.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
Who the hell do you think you are
playing with? What is this?
HARRY ANSLINGER
I know you are friends with Miss
Holiday. We’re trying to help her.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
I just bet you are.
HARRY ANSLINGER
We have intel that you don’t
approve of her drug use.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
I’m unaware of any drug use by Miss
Holiday.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Would you consider her a friend?
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
Yes... Billie has got lots of
friends.
HARRY ANSLINGER
I hear she likes to get to know her
lady friends. Intimately.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
I wouldn’t know about that.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Are you sexually involved with Miss
Holiday?

Tallulah manages Mister on a leash while Billie walks her new
little poodle. They’re glamorously dressed in black, both are
in shades, jewels and fur. These two women look out of place
against the bright Easter colors the children wear hunting
through the park for their eggs.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
The whole things was unnerving,
darling.
BILLIE
I’m sorry you had to go through all
that Bankie.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
You’re not still using that stuff,
are you?
BILLIE
It’s such a nice day, can’t we
enjoy it please?
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
Hey, how’s John Levy treating you?
BILLIE
I’m singing in his club.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD
I heard he’s stealing your money.
Billie won’t answer her.
TALLULAH BANKHEAD (CONT'D)
You could do better. They’re all
using you.
Billie shakes her head.
BILLIE
You’ll never understand my life
Bankhead.
(then, serious)
What makes you think I’m not using
them?

49

Billie takes Tallulah’s arm. They continue down the street
watching the children and their parents play with the EASTER
BUNNY.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(re: her dogs)
Mister can beg but he can’t heel,
you know. It ain’t his fault. I
didn’t train him. I’m going to
train this one right, though.
Louis McKay walks past them. He has a beautiful woman by his
side. Louis tips his hat.
LOUIS MCKAY
Small world.
BILLIE
(flirts)
Only if you’re following me.
They smile at each other. Two ships passing in the park.
LOUIS MCKAY
I’ll follow you to the moon and
back. And train that dog for you
for free. I vote we ditch these
snow bunnies and get into some
black shit.
Oh God!

TALLULAH BANKHEAD
I loathe Easter.

In drizzling rain, Billie leaves Levy’s. She walks down his

pops her umbrella.
BILLIE
(to her dog)
He won’t miss us none. I been
singing there all this time,
packing that motherfucker... Shit,

We see Billie panicked. She’s jonesing BAD. She tries to hide
it from the many people passing her by on the street.
BILLIE
Fuck that clinic shit, Joe.
JOE GUY
Billie, man let’s go together. You

Billie and Roslyn enter laughing. They find Levy sitting at
Billie’s dressing table with a gun strapped to his holster.
BILLIE
Hey Daddy, sorry I Levy backhands Billie. She falls to the floor.
JOHN LEVY
What do you take me for?
John turns to sit back at her dressing table. Combs his hair
in her mirror as if nothing just happened. Roslyn stands
there stunned.
JOHN LEVY (CONT'D)
You sneak off with my money and
then you come sing in my club?
Levy sips his drink. Billie breaks a wooden chair over his
head. Levy stands woozy.
JOHN LEVY (CONT'D)
You cheap whore!
He punches Billie square in her jaw. On the ground again he
kicks her in the gut.
JOHN LEVY (CONT'D)
Go out there and make me some
money.

Roslyn screams, helping her up. Levy heads for the door.

Just after Billie’s fight with Levy. Miss Freddy and Roslyn
tape Billie’s ribs so she can go on stage. It’s a careful
process, a labor of love. Billie tries not to cry. THE WORKS
- syringe, and spoon, on the dressing table. Miss Freddy
applies lipstick to Billie’s mouth and Lady Day is ready to
perform.

INT. CLUB EBONY - MOMENTS LATER - OCTOBER 1948

Billie on stage. Holding her hands to her taped ribs,
underneath her gorgeous gown. She’s high and hunched over
from the beating but she’s focused. The AUDIENCE, looking on
expectantly as she sings LOVER MAN. Levy is deep in talks
with Carter. Jimmy Fletcher watches from the back of the
club.

INT. SAN FRANCISCO, MARK TWAIN HOTEL - DAY - JANUARY 1949 63
The PHONOGRAPH playing “Precious Memories.” We clock Levy’s
black eye as he and Billie eat lunch. The happy couple.
BILLIE
That gal sure can sing. Maybe I
should learn how to play the
guitar.
JOHN LEVY
Some people would say we have a
very unhealthy thing going on here.
BILLIE
Why? Cause I punched you in the eye
downstairs in the lobby?
(then)
You’ll learn to pay me on time.
He laughs. Billie laughs too.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(proud)
Can you believe I ain’t used in two
whole months?!... Well a little bit
a methadone, but that’s just to
take edge off.
JOHN LEVY
Yes I can baby. Hey, how come you
don’t ever talk about marriage? You
know how much I need you.
BILLIE
Levy, shut up. You’re already
married.
JOHN LEVY
I told you I was getting a divorce.
BILLIE
I like our arrangement just fine.
JOHN LEVY
Is that right, maybe this gift will
change your mind.
Levy goes into the next room.

Billie follows.

Levy looks at his watch.
BILLIE
What you gone and got me Daddy?
Levy takes a small package out of his pocket and slips it in
Billie’s robe pocket. Without missing a beat, Billie drops
the gift grabbing his hand.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
What is this Levy?
Billie, sensing what’s up, keeps hold tight to Levy’s hand.
Federal Agents burst into the room. Agent Carter leads the
charge with Fletcher following. Levy holds his hands up.
Billie’s caught holding the bag. Jimmy and Billie share a
look. Then Jimmy looks at Levy. And he sees a frame-up plain
as day.

JIMMY FLETCHER
The fact that the drug works, the
syringe, the spoon, and so forth,
the fact that they were found in
the wastepaper basket, that was
odd, yeah. The junkie will usually
keep their works close by. And,
yeah, she was holding the opium,
but --.
Billie sits taking this in. Her Lawyer ERLICH in front of her
still questioning Jimmy.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY ERLICH
So, this could have been a frameup?
JIMMY FLETCHER
I didn’t say that.

Jimmy walks down the staircase and meets Anslinger at the
bottom.
HARRY ANSLINGER
You looked like Nate King Cole up

went down the drain.

INT. NIGHT CLUB, BALTIMORE - EVENING - APRIL 1949

A modest hotspot. Billie and the band perform for an eager,
mostly black working class AUDIENCE. Jimmy Fletcher’s in the
audience. For some reason Billie is happy to see him. She
tries not to show it. The crowd cheer and applaud as Prez
leads the band in.
BILLIE
(sings)
Up in Harlem every Saturday night,
when the highbrows get together
it's just so right. They all
congregate at an all night hop,
and what they do is oo bop bee dap.
Billie is having the time of her life singing to her home
town. Roslyn and Miss Freddy dance together.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Oh Hannah Brown from way cross
town, gets full of coin and starts
breaking 'em down. And at the break
of day, you can hear old Hannah say
'Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of
beer, send me again, I don't care.
I feel just like I wanna clown,
give the piano player a drink

The musicians gathered. There’s a low-key party going on.
Drinking and drugs.
LESTER
You can’t be fucking around with
our cash Billie. We ain’t got none.
Before Billie can answer, Jimmy enters. Everyone gives him a
dirty look except her.
ROSLYN
I know you better get the fuck out
of here.
Lester and the boys head over to throw him out. Billie senses
a fight.
BILLIE
Leave him alone.
LESTER
You know how much trouble this cat
has caused us.
BILLIE
Leave him be.
They reluctantly back down.
MISS FREDDY
A hard head makes a soft ass. You
still ain’t learned her lesson yet.
BILLIE
(to the band)
It’s complicated.
(then to Jimmy)
Thanks for what you did in the
courtroom.
JIMMY FLETCHER
They want you to think they fired
me.
Billie takes this in.

LESTER YOUNG
If you want to fuck around with
this one that’s on you. But I want
to get paid. If the club didn’t
have the money, why’d we play?
BILLIE
He gave us what they had. We’ll
make up for it tomorrow night.
A DRUG DEALER, black, 40s, passes Billie some heroin. She
doesn’t pay until she’s tasted the stuff. There are only a
few bills in her purse, but she hands them over.

Billie cooking up her fix. The greedy junky. ROSLYN and MISS
FREDDY ROSLYN
How come she’s got her white dress,
her white flowers and her white
powder, but she don’t got money to
pay us.
MISS FREDDY
You knew what you were getting into
when you came on the road with us,
stupid.
LESTER and JIMMY LESTER YOUNG
You’re gonna follow us around the
whole country in that car?
JIMMY FLETCHER
I don’t got nothing better to do.
The musicians, overhearing, not totally buying his story.
LESTER YOUNG
I trust you about as far as I can
throw your ass.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Lady trusts me.
BILLIE
No I don’t.
Folks laugh at that.

ROSLYN
(to Jimmy)
So, hypothetically, you catch me,
and, even though I’m not holding
nothing in my hand, in the trunk of
my car, I do got a considerable
quantity.
JIMMY FLETCHER
You ride around with drugs in the
trunk of your car?
MISS FREDDY
She said “hypothetically,” man.
JIMMY FLETCHER
If it’s your car, then we could
probably bust you for possession.
ROSLYN
That’s some ridiculous shit.
The musicians fall out laughing.

Billie’s already shot up. Several other musicians have joined
her.
BASS PLAYER
(offering Jimmy heroin)
Want a taste?
Will Jimmy partake? He knows he needs to win their trust.
All eyes on him. Billie’s clocking him. Here’s his chance.
He rolls up his sleeve. Billie watches Jimmy. They’re all
watching him. Even the Drug Dealer. Bass Player helps him
shoot up. Jimmy leans back in his chair. Riding the wave.
It’s an all time high.
MOMENTS LATER, BILLIE AND JIMMY Everything is perfect and pleasant and completely free of
complication. All the notes are all in tune, conversation
makes more sense, and Billie, watching Jimmy, is more
beautiful than ever. Both are connected in a euphoric dream
state. Jimmy rests his eyes.
A young BILLIE HOLIDAY, 10, smiles at Jimmy.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
You feel it? That shit is good,
ain’t it?

Jimmy opens his eyes, shakes his head. Is this what heroin
does?

Ten year old Billie looks from bedroom to bedroom for her
mother. Jimmy follows a bit behind.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
Momma?
Whores and their Johns stagger down the hallway. They all say
hi to young Billie. They don’t notice Jimmy.

Young Billie pops her head in rooms looking for her Mother.
No luck. Finally WHORE

Young Billie enters the room, she sighs sadly after seeing no
sign of her mother. Jimmy follows. He’s completely unnoticed
by young Billie now. He rests on Sadie’s bed. Young Billie
heads for her mother’s phonograph. Play’s Bessie Smith. She
belts, “Ain’t Nobody’s Business” along with the record. She
goes for her comic book, lays on the hardwood floor, singing
while reading.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
(singing)
And I’m gonna do what I want to
anyway. And I don’t care what
people say.
The door quietly opens. It’s her mother, SADIE, 23, a short
but voluptuous black woman.

60

She marvels at her daughter’s ability to sing along while
simultaneously reading her comic. Billie’s eyes light up when
she see’s her.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE (CONT'D)
Momma! Where you been?
SADIE
(blunt)
You gotta go Eleanora.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
Why?
SADIE
Time you figure out how to make
your own money now. Go on.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
I don’t wanna go, momma.
SADIE
You’re a woman now Eleanora. It’s
a woman’s job to keep her men
happy.
TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
What you mean happy?
SADIE
What the fuck you think I mean?
Happy! Make that nigga happy! Touch
him, caress him. Love on him! (Be a

TEN YEAR OLD BILLIE
But I don’t wanna be a fuckin

SADIE
It’s good enough for me, ain’t it?
Go on now. You can do it. Ain’t no

Deeper into the woods, Billie looks around at remnants of a
picnic. She sees smoke coming from somewhere. She’s about to
take a squat but stops short when she hears crying. Billie
stands, going even deeper into the back woods. WE SEE two
black children sobbing as they watch their father try to undo
his wife’s dangling body from a nearby tree. The family’s
home has been burned to the ground. Shellshocked, Billie
walks backwards into Jimmy. Horrified, Billie runs into a
nearby shack.

INT. ABANDONED SHACK - MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy follows her into the neighboring abandoned shack. In
the abandoned living room he tries to console her. Billie is
having a nervous breakdown. She escapes him into the
abandoned dining room. From nowhere, Miss Freddy and Roslyn
appear in tears. They also try to calm Billie. She fights
them away shaking and sobbing uncontrollably into a bathroom.
From a mirror, she notices Carl the drummer who is preparing
the works for her. He smiles, encouraging Billie to shoot up.
Billie wants it bad. She goes to him. But Jimmy Fletcher
appears and yanks her violently away.

Torn between the two men she staggers into yet another
hallway where there appears to be a light at the end of it.

Billie exits the hallway onto the stage and sings Strange
Fruit to a sold out crowd.
BILLIE
(singing)
Southern trees bear a strange
fruit. Blood on the leaves and
blood at the root. Black bodies
swinging in the southern breeze.
Strange fruit hanging from the
poplar trees.
Pastoral scene of the gallant
South. The bulging eyes and the
twisted mouth. Scent of magnolia,
sweet and fresh. Then the sudden
smell of burning flesh.
Here is a fruit for the crows to
pluck. For the rain to gather, for
the wind to suck. For the sun to
rot, for the tree to drop. Here is
a strange and bitter crop.

Jimmy’s outside on a payphone. The BLACK MOTEL OWNER watches
him through his window cautiously. Jimmy keeps his voice low.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Not at all, Mr. Anslinger, I
haven’t seen her do anything but
alcohol. Home-made variety for the
most part.
HARRY ANSLINGER (O.S.)
No narcotics of any kind?
JIMMY FLETCHER
No, Sir.
Long silence.
JIMMY FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Are you still there? Sir?

HARRY ANSLINGER (O.S.)
Baton Rouge is next?
JIMMY FLETCHER
That’s right. I never knew the
musicians’ life could be so boring.
Another long silence. The hairs on Jimmy’s neck stand on end.
Does Anslinger know that Jimmy is lying to him?
HARRY ANSLINGER (O.S.)
You make sure you call me tomorrow.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yes, Sir, Mr. Anslinger.
Anslinger’s end of the line goes dead. A nervous Jimmy
returns the receiver to its cradle. SHIT! He enters back into
the hotel. We stay on the BLACK MOTEL OWNER watching it all.
He sees something we haven’t. Agent Carter, standing in the
parking lot. Carter’s been clocking Jimmy’s every move.

JIMMY FLETCHER
Thought you were asleep.
BILLIE
You were making a phone call.
Jimmy doesn’t want to answer.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
To your boss?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yeah.
BILLIE
You tell him everything I do?
JIMMY FLETCHER
No.
BILLIE
You tell him you shot up?

No.

JIMMY FLETCHER

BILLIE
You tell him you fucked me good?
JIMMY FLETCHER
No.
BILLIE
What are they gonna give you,
Jimmy? A shiny gold watch? A
brand new car? Your picture in the
paper? I get all that every day of
the week.
Jimmy leans against the wall. Billie holds his gaze.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Come back to bed.
She helps him get undressed. They get back to making love.

BILLIE
Jimmy, we need to talk.
Jimmy senses where this conversation is headed.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Let’s go back to New York. I’d

the help you need. Start taking
care of yourself.

BILLIE
Stop. Jimmy you need to get
yourself a nice girl. I’m not her.
He takes her hand. She kisses him on his forehead.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
We aren’t meant to be Jimmy. I only
know a certain kind of love that
makes me feel safe, you dig. I
don’t understand this, what we got.
I don’t feel in control.
Just then, a FANCY CAR comes barreling down the road. In the
car, it’s Louis McKay. She feels awful but she knows she’s
doing the right thing.
LOUIS MCKAY
(to Billie)
You called saying you was stranded
so I drove all night to get here!
McKay checks his teeth in the rearview mirror.
BILLIE
(to McKay)
I’m coming.
(to Jimmy)
I’m sorry, Jimmy.
McKay holds the door and Billie gets in his car.
MISS FREDDY
You just gone leave us like stray
mutts? We don’t have money for gas
to get home.
Billie heads to the car not wanting to look back.
BILLIE
Come on.
(to the Musicians)
I’ll wire money when I get home.
LESTER
I thought we was family? You don’t
do this shit to family. No Lady,
I’m done.
BILLIE
I said I’ll wire the money Prez.
Prez walks away. Billie really feels like shit now. She looks
out the car window at Jimmy lovingly.

McKay’s car takes off and they’re gone in a cloud of dust.
Jimmy is crestfallen.

have all been removed. Agent Sam Williams, deep in his own
paperwork.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Where’s my stuff? Sam what’s going
on?
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
I’m sorry Jimmy.
Both don’t believe it.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS (CONT'D)
What do you want me to say Jimmy?
They want me to pick up where you
left off.
JIMMY
Where’s my shit Sam?
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
They took it. They’re moving you
over to administration, Jimmy.
They want me to pick up where you
left off.
JIMMY
The war on drugs is just a war on
us.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
I can’t just leave this job. I’ve
got a family.
JIMMY
They’re going to fuck you too.

GEORGE JESSEL sits interview style with Billie. She looks
radiant. Louis McKay watches from the wings.
GEORGE JESSEL
Let’s get on with this straight, in
the more realistic sense the big
comeback of her career was launched
not tonight but over five years
ago, when there was a year of
darkness when she fell victim to
one of society’s most dreaded
illnesses, the use of narcotics.
Billie, it’s a privilege to have
you with us tonight.
BILLIE
Thank you George. It’s an honor to
be here.
89

INT. JIMMY FLETCHER’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME - OCTOBER 1953 89
ON THE TELEVISION GEORGE JESSEL
Well we’re glad to have you.
Now Billie, this is the usual part
of our procedure in this show to
introduce from the audience the
family of our guests. Those near
ones who were there and who are
there to give the strength and
security needed when their kinfolk
are in trouble. But there’s no one
here to remember for Billie. No
family. Not a single relative that
she knows.
Billie nods in agreement.
BILLIE
I have my husband, Mr. Louis McKay.
Jimmy stares at Billie.

her.

Billie is high and alone. She carefully re-applies her
lipstick. Jimmy opens the door.
Jimmy and Billie kiss until someone breaks the door down.
It’s Louis McKay. He charges at Jimmy. They tumble on the
floor fighting. Drug use has not been kind to McKay. And this
time it is Jimmy who gets the better of the fight. Once he’s
on top of McKay, he punches him repeatedly. Billie goes back
to applying her make up. The men fight until they’re out of
breath. They end up on the carpet breathing heavy. Billie
stares at them both.
LOUIS MCKAY
You can have the bitch.

INT. TBD JANKY APARTMENT/RADIO STATION - NIGHT
Billie, still strung out, continues her interview with
Reginald Lord Devine. Reginald rides Billie hard.
REGINALD DEVINE
Our audience wants to know, what
happened with Louis McKay? You two
seemed soooo in love, and then poof, he just vanished out of
nowhere. Poof.
BILLIE
McKay and me, we’re... separated.
He’s trying to control my estate.
But my friend Jimmy’s been with me.
He’s been helpful.
FREDDY
(sotto)
Helpful alright. Fucking FED.
Can’t nobody just let her be.
REGINALD DEVINE
What is the government’s problem
with Billie Holiday? Why is the
government always after you?
BILLIE
My song. Strange Fruit reminds them
that they’re killing us. It reminds
them. It reminds you, Reginald.

REGINALD DEVINE
(serious)
Oh Lady please don’t say that.
Please don’t say that. See this is
why you get into all sorts of
trouble.
(back to his regular
voice, to Freddy)
Don’t worry, I’ll edit this.
BILLIE
You don’t have to edit nothing for
Anslinger. He was in charge of
prohibition and you see us
drinking, don’t you?
(chuckles)
He can’t afford to lose with drugs.
REGINALD DEVINE
But it’s a war on drugs, Lady. Not
you.
This lands hard on Billie. She knows this is a lie that
everybody believes. She begins to cry.
BILLIE
That’s what they want you to
believe.
(beat)
They say they want the names of my
suppliers. They don’t. They want to
destroy me.
(sighs)
He wants me to stop singing what’s
in my soul.
REGINALD DEVINE
Stop singing the damn song then
honey. Won’t life be easier on you
if you just behave?
Billie’s tired. She wipes her tears, embarrassed to have
shown emotion. Finally, nods in agreement. The drugs are
wearing off.

I can’t seem to get these words.
Where is LADY SINGS THE BLUES?
PRODUCER
We recorded that one a few years
back, Miss Holiday.
ANGLE ON - Her sheet music. Billie can’t make heads or tails
of it. She looks up from the music and into the recording
booth.
ROSLYN
Baby, we’re going to go home, okay?
BILLIE
Geewiz, I’m a little confused.
(then)
Jimmy, is that you out there?

cleaning. Most of the plants are dying or already dead.
Billie, wearing silk pajamas chain smokes. Sister Rosetta
Tharpe’s “Cain’t No Grave Hold My Body” plays on a phonograph
as Billie sings along. She joins Jimmy on the bed.
BILLIE
I should of been a gospel singer,
you know? I like Sister Rosetta.
She brings some sunshine to death,
you know.

Prez died. His wife wouldn’t let
me sing at his funeral.

I miss him.

FLOWERS, a PHONOGRAPH, some RECORDS and some COMIC BOOKS.
Billie sitting up in bed reading a GET WELL CARD. A HOSPITAL
ORDERLY brings in yet another BUNCH OF FLOWERS. Adds them to
the other gifts.
JIMMY FLETCHER
Your fans love you. The NAACP says
Billie Holiday is the voice of our
people.
Billie ponders this. Tears well.
BILLIE
Try not to blame yourself for any
of this.
The nurse interrupts.

NURSE
You got well-wishers crowding up in
the street outside. It’s pretty
wild out there.
BILLIE
That’s swell.
The Nurse leaves the room. Billie gives Jimmy a wink. Jimmy
lights a cigarette for her. Billie takes a deep inhale. She
looks at her chipped unmanicured nails. She tries to fix her
hair.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
I must look a mess. Help me paint
my nails.
JIMMY FLETCHER
I don’t know how to do that.
BILLIE
Man. Grab me my purse. I got two
bottles in there. Give me the blood
red.
Jimmy abides. He sits painting Billie’s nails.

Jimmy steps off the elevator straight into Anslinger and
Carter.
HARRY ANSLINGER
You’re out of line being here.
AGENT CARTER
Maybe he’s supplying her too.
Jimmy goes to slug Carter. But he stops his own fist and
holds himself together.
HARRY ANSLINGER
If you obstruct us, we have enough
to tie you to her. And it’s a long
way down.
Jimmy gets in Anslinger’s face. As much as his training and
ambition will allow. We think he’s going to throttle his
boss.

75

JIMMY FLETCHER
You hate her. Despite all the shit
in her life, she’s made something
of herself and you can’t take it.
Because she’s strong, beautiful,
and black.
Jimmy’s punctured the veil and exposed the truth. But
Anslinger doesn’t even blink. Carter and Anslinger walk
away. Leaving Jimmy alone. He’s spoken truth to power. But it
might be too late.

INT. BILLIE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER - JULY 1959

Jimmy sits in the same chair. Billie and Jimmy fall asleep
looking at each other.
LATER
Jimmy’s startled awake by someone kicking his foot. It’s
Agent Sam Williams. And McKay is with him. Tension between
Jimmy and McKay. Jimmy jumps up ready to fight. Sam comes
between them. Billie stirs awake. McKay turns. All smiles.
LOUIS MCKAY
Hey baby. They say you not feeling
so good.
BILLIE
Yea, all of sudden I’m not.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
(to Jimmy)
Let me take you home.
No.

JIMMY FLETCHER

BILLIE
No.

Louis McKay balls his fist, ready to fight again. Billie sees
the possible brawl and intercepts.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Jimmy come here.
Jimmy goes over to her bed. This only infuriates McKay more.
She whispers to Jimmy.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
What the critics say about my last
record?
Jimmy’s stunned by her question...really, right now?

76

JIMMY FLETCHER
I thought you don’t care about
them?
BILLIE
I don’t...I just...I want people to
like it, ya dig?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Critics didn’t like it. But does it
matter?
BILLIE
Did you like it?
JIMMY FLETCHER
Yes.
Billie smiles.
BILLIE
Go on and scram so I can get this
man out of here.
Billie doesn’t want Jimmy in any trouble. She nods for him to
go. Jimmy reluctantly heads to the door, he turns back.
Unsure.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(winks)
Go on. I’ll see you in church,
soldier boy.
Jimmy smiles back. Somewhere in his gut says this is their
goodbye.

EXT. HOSPITAL - FOLLOWING - JULY 1959

As they exit the hospital Jimmy sees the sizable CROWD OF
FANS that have gathered in the street. Many holding “LET LADY
LIVE” picket signs. They’re quiet and respectful, keeping a
vigil for Billie. He sees Roslyn weeping on the side walk.
ROSLYN
My friend is a nurse in there. She
overheard the feds saying they gone
take her off of the methadone if
she don’t talk. She’s going through
withdrawal, man. It’ll kill her if
they do that.
She weeps in Jimmy’s arms.

77

ROSLYN (CONT'D)
Those bastards won’t let me in. She
needs me.
Jimmy looks up helpless to Agent Sam Williams. But Agent
Williams has even worse news.
AGENT SAM WILLIAMS
And if that doesn’t work, Anslinger
is going to plant heroine on her.
They plan to arrest Billie in her
bed.

another agent operating the machine.
HARRY ANSLINGER
(smiles)
So very nice to meet you finally
Miss Holiday. My wife is such a
fan.
Billie smiles back.
LOUIS MCKAY
She understands what you need.
Billie and me discussed things. She
hasn’t been well but she’s sorry
for the trouble she’s caused and
she’s ready to help.
HARRY ANSLINGER
Just for the record, I’m going to
need for you to state your name.
Billie lights a cigarette. Smiles. On a bedside table - a
stack of SIGNED LEGAL PAPERS. How much of her life has she
signed away?
BILLIE
My name is Billie Holiday.
She lets the words hang in the air, then goes quiet, smokes.
LOUIS MCKAY
Go on, Lady. Go ahead and speak
your piece.
Billie locks eyes with Anslinger and Carter. She’s down and
out but she won’t look away.

78

Billie’s eyes well up with tears. There’s an internal
struggle going on. The same fight that she’s been fighting
all her life. To somehow stay alive and thrive in this mess
of a world. She wipes at her eyes, steadies her breath.
Manages a smile. McKay gives her hand a gentle squeeze. The
tape machine goes round and round. She clears her throat.
BILLIE
You think I’m going to stop singing
that song? Your grandkids’ll be
singing STRANGE FRUIT!
(she laughs)
Y’all motherfuckers think you got
me? You don’t! You stupid bitches
don’t got shit on me
(beat)
Suck my black ass!
She laughs at them. She spits blood at Carter. McKay is
embarrassed. Carter wipes the spit.
Billie laughs harder. The men look on disturbed. Humiliated,
McKay leaves, followed by Carter. Anslinger looks on at her
though. He can’t believe the life that’s left in this dying
woman. Finally defeated, he’s the last to leave. Alone,
Billie’s laughter finally dies. She is left with that silence
she hates.

She’s in fine form.

(singing)
All of me. Why not take all of me.
Can’t you see, I’m no good without
you. Take my lips I want to lose
them. Take arms, I’ll never use
them.
Your goodbye left me eyes that cry.
How can I go on dear without you.
You took the part that once was my
heart so why not take all of me.
And the way she still makes all of us feel special, even
today, so many years after her death. She’s luminous and
she’ll live forever.
