INT. SWEET SIXTEEN’S DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT
A super-depressing dancefloor on a Thursday night. 2-For-1
shots and a sticky floor. The kind of last-resort place
people end up after work having accidentally nailed ten “just
one” drinks.
A bored DJ plays the DROELOE remix of “Boys” by Charlie XCX,
while the thin and kind of tragic crowd dances.
We linger on the men dancing in particular, their bodies, the
sweat running down their backs as they grind and thrust. The
slow-mo, the lascivious pan-up, the sort of erotic gaze
normally reserved for oiled-up music-video hotties. Except
we’re looking at regular dudes in chinos with absolutely no
dancing ability.
INT. SWEET SIXTEEN’S UPSTAIRS BAR - NIGHT
By the bar, is a group of guys still in their work suits,
ties loosened. They’re mostly good-looking, in their earlythirties, bantering and eyeing up the diminishing talent
pool. Among them are JEZ, a shy, sweet guy who is clearly
dying to leave, and PAUL, a sweaty Alpha-bro whose superfragile masculinity is always one rejection away from
shattering to pieces.
PAUL
Fuck her, man. It’s how things are
done. It’s just a fucking round of
golf! You’d think we were taking
clients to a strip club or
somethingJIM
-which we can’t anymorePAUL
-Exactly we can’t even do that
anymore because of last year’s
Christmas party.
JEZ
I think it’s because the golf club
doesn’t let women play there.
The guys stare at JEZ.
So?

PAUL

2

JEZ
So...it means we’re having client
meetings without her.

3

PAUL
Look she should focus on closing her
own shit. Not whining because we’re
all doing better than her.
Something catches PAUL’S eye.
Jesus.

PAUL (CONT'D)

The guys follow his gaze. Across the club, sprawled on a damp
leather sofa is CASSANDRA, late-20s. She is hammered, her
hair plastered to her face, mascara under her glazed eyes,
the skirt of her pinstriped work suit riding up.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Look at that. God almighty. Get some
dignity, sweetheart.
The guys all laugh, except JEZ.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You know. They put themselves in
danger, girls like that. If she’s
not careful someone’s going to take
advantage and then she’ll be the one
in tears tomorrow morning.
JIM
She’s kinda hot.
PAUL
She’s a hot fucking mess.
CASSANDRA moves on the sofa, we see her underwear.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I mean look at that.
PAUL sneers. They all look. We feel that slow, animal shift
in the group, from disgust to desire, to a heady sense of
opportunity.
JEZ
(trying to divert
attention)
Hey guys, I was thinking maybe we
should talk to Brian again. I think
he might be coming round toThe guys aren’t listening. They are all mesmerized by
CASSANDRA and the possibility she represents.

4

PAUL
I’m sorry that is asking for it.
You’d think you’d know better by her
age, wouldn’t you? Where are her
friends? Fucked off somewhere and
left her lying around for anyone to
pick up.
JIM
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.
PAUL eyes her up, thinking.
PAUL
Yeah. Maybe.
JEZ intervenes.
JEZ
I’ll go over.
The guys whoop.
Ooooooh!

PAUL

JIM
Didn’t know you had it in you!
JEZ
To see if she’s ok.
PAUL
Sure, sure. Mmmm-hmmm. Absolutely.
PAUL winks.
INT. SWEET SIXTEEN’S UPSTAIRS BAR - MOMENTS LATER
CASSANDRA is haphazardly looking through her purse. JEZ
approaches.
JEZ
You ok? What are you looking for?
CASSANDRA looks up woozily.
Phone.

CASSANDRA

JEZ sits down next to her. CASSANDRA continues to look.

5

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
S’not here.
She starts to look around the couch, he helps.
JEZ
Could you have left in...in the
bathroom maybe?
CASSANDRA
I...maybe...
JEZ
I’ll go look.
CASSANDRA watches him go. So do his friends, who are watching
them both with great interest. CASSANDRA looks back at them
warily.
INT. SWEET SIXTEEN’S UPSTAIRS BAR - LATER
JEZ returns. No phone.
JEZ
No phone in there. I’m sorry. Are
you going to be ok?
Oh yeah.

CASSANDRA

She gives him a thumbs up.
JEZ
How are you going to get home?
CASSANDRA
The ryde app.
JEZ
I think you need a phone for that.
...Oh...

CASSANDRA

JEZ looks nervously over at his friends. He makes a decision.
JEZ
Look, I’m going home now anyway. I
can drop you somewhere?
No...

CASSANDRA

6

JEZ
Honestly. It’s fine.
CASSANDRA looks up at him gratefully. He gives her his hands
and hoists her up.
JEZ (CONT'D)
There we are.
She falls onto him, leaning on him as they walk out. He looks
back at his friends who are all laughing and miming jerking
off and thrusting. JEZ rolls his eyes at them.
INT. SWEET SIXTEEN’S STAIRWELL - NIGHT
JEZ helps CASSANDRA down the stairs.
INT. PICKUP - LATER
The Pickup driver, MONTY, glances at CASSANDRA in the mirror.
The window is down and the wind is in her face, she’s
desperately trying to sober up.
MONTY
(suspicious)
I just got my car cleaned.
JEZ
She’s fine.
CASSANDRA
I’m not going to throw up...I don’t
think...
JEZ
There you are, sir, she’s not going
to throw up.
CASSANDRA gives herself a little ‘Whoo!’.
JEZ laughs. She looks over and smiles hazily. Is there...a
spark here? She is really pretty. And she seems cool, from
the five words she’s said...
JEZ (CONT'D)
Hey, you know, my apartment is only
a few blocks away. You
wanna...um...maybe have a drink
before hitting the hay?
Um...

CASSANDRA

7

JEZ
I mean, it’s literally just here.
One beer?

8

Um...

CASSANDRA

JEZ
(to the driver)
Hey, could we go to 242 Raleigh
Drive instead? It’s a couple of
blocks.
MONTY looks at JEZ, then over at CASSANDRA in the mirror. She
is obviously very drunk.
MONTY
Put the address in the app.
INT. JEZ’S APARTMENT - LATER
A small, messy apartment, gaming cords tangled on the floor,
dishes stacked up. JEZ comes in and turns the lights on,
picking up a few things from the floor and throwing them on a
chair. We’ve seen this move in many a bro movie: this could
be the start of any dude-skewed romance.
JEZ
Sorry...it’s a mess. Embarrassing. I
wasn’t expecting...
CASSANDRA ignores this, and slumps down on the couch.
JEZ (CONT'D)
What can I get for ya, milady?
He rummages through the cupboards.
JEZ (CONT'D)
We have beer...vodka...and...
He takes out a disgusting looking bottle of orange liqueur.
JEZ (CONT'D)
And a kumquat liqueur my parents
brought back from Greece.
CASSANDRA
Kumquat...?
This is a question. Not a request.
JEZ
Kumquat it is!
He pours it. CASSANDRA looks around his apartment.

9

CASSANDRA
D’you...live alone here?
JEZ
No. But don’t worry. My roommate’s
out of town.
CASSANDRA looks a little concerned by this- JEZ doesn’t
notice.
JEZ sits down next to her and hands her the bright orange
drink. He’s poured her significantly more than he has
himself. CASSANDRA drinks it. She chokes on it a little.
CASSANDRA
Ugh. That’s disgusting.
JEZ looks at her, he gently wipes the mascara from under her
eyes.
JEZ
You’re so beautiful.
Thanks.

CASSANDRA

CASSANDRA isn’t seeing straight. JEZ leans in to kiss her.
She does not respond, but she does not push him away. The
kiss is entirely one-sided, but JEZ doesn’t notice.
He pulls away, looks down at her lovingly. Overwhelmed by the
moment.
Wow.

JEZ

CASSANDRA looks on the verge of vomiting.
CASSANDRA
I don’t feel good. I need to lie
down.
JEZ
Oh...yeah of course!
INT. JEZ'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
JEZ’s leads her to his bed and she falls down onto it. He
looks down on her. A beat. Then he gets on the bed beside
her. Trailing his fingers up and down her stomach. She closes
her eyes.

10

JEZ
Hey, hey. Don’t go to sleep.
She opens her eyes a crack. He starts to kiss her, up and
down her neck.
JEZ (CONT'D)
God, you are so pretty.
He kisses her. She doesn’t respond. He starts unbuttoning her
dress. He kisses her body gently.
What...
Shhh...

CASSANDRA
JEZ

He continues to unbutton her, pulling down her bra. CASSANDRA
starts to get a little concerned.
Wait...

CASSANDRA

JEZ
Don’t worry, hey, it’s ok, you’re
ok. You’re safe.
He really believes that she is.
What...

CASSANDRA

JEZ
God, your body.
CASSANDRA
What are you...
JEZ begins to gently pull her underwear down her legs.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
(confused, super drunk)
What are you doing?
Her underwear is around her knees, JEZ is staring between her
legs.
Hey. HEY!

CASSANDRA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

JEZ looks up. CASSANDRA is sitting, looking directly at him.
She is stone, cold sober.

11

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I said: what are you doing?
JEZ looks back at her, his hands still holding her underwear,
terrified.
CUT TO BLACK. “Lovesick” by Lindstrom and Christabelle brings
up the titles.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN.
EXT. STREET - DAWN
The music continues on bare feet walking down a disgusting
sidewalk- unidentified puddles and cigarette butts. A spatter
of what looks like blood hits the paving stones. As we pull
out we reveal CASSANDRA, in last night’s clothes, high heels
in one hand, “blood” running down one elbow. It is only when
we see her fully we see she is eating a breakfast hotdog.
She looks completely remorseless, calm and, honestly, pretty
cool. Whatever the hell she’s done, it’s made her feel great.
She walks past the CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are working the
street. Someone calls out “WALK OF SHAME”.
CASSANDRA stops. She stares over at the sniggering
construction guys. They’re suddenly a little embarrassed.
She just keeps staring silently for a long while. Until, a
little spooked, they move on.
She carries on walking. Satisfied.
INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Later that morning. Silence. An ordinary, middle-class
kitchen. Too-runny eggs and the hostile sound of squeaking
cutlery on the plates. CASSANDRA has cleaned up and is poking
food around her plate. It’s like last night never happened.
Her father, STANLEY, kind and rumpled, sits opposite her,
reading the paper. Her mother, SUSAN, a woman whose
exhaustion and anxiety is horribly palpable, brings over some
coffee.
STANLEY
Didn’t hear you come in last night.
CASSANDRA continues to eat her eggs.

12

STANLEY (CONT'D)
Everything alright?

13

CASSANDRA
I had to work late.
Neither of her parents are buying this, but neither can bring
themselves to call it out.
STANLEY
The coffee shop closes at nine.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
We had to do inventory.
SUSAN comes to sit down. There’s more tense silence as they
all eat.
SUSAN
You have to do a lot of inventory at
that place. You should speak to the
manager.
I will.

CASSANDRA

INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - LATER
CASSANDRA sits behind the cashier’s desk of a multi-colored,
hipster coffee shop. She stares at the wall.
Her boss, GAIL, 40s, wonderful, is cleaning the coffee
machine.
GAIL
You look tired, Cassie.
CASSANDRA
Aw. Thank you, Gail!
GAIL
Want a coffee? Head office sent over
this new blend from Zanzibar to try.
It’s disgusting but really strong.
Sold.

CASSANDRA

GAIL starts to make it for her.
GAIL
You know, I was actually talking to
Graham earlier. He says there’s a
position opening up over there.
(MORE)

14

GAIL (CONT'D)
And- don’t freak out- I want you to
know I recommended you for it.
A pretty hipster girl, RUBY, comes into the shop. She waits
patiently at the register, CASSANDRA makes no attempt to
serve her.
CASSANDRA
(to GAIL)
Why did you do that?
GAIL
Because you’ve worked here for three
years, this is a summer job for a
stoned teenager, it’s not a career
move. I’m pushing you out of the
nest, honey. You’re stinking up the
place with your sad little face.
RUBY tries to interject but fails.
CASSANDRA
But I like it here!
GAIL
No you don’t.
CASSANDRA
Well, no, I don’t. But I like you.
And I like...
She gestures to RUBY.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Working in a customer-facing role.
RUBY
Great, could I have an oat milk,
single-shot latteNo.

CASSANDRA

RUBY storms out.
See?
Cassie.

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
GAIL

CASSANDRA
Don’t ‘Cassie’ me.
I’m fine, Gail. Really.

15

GAIL looks at her, concerned.

16

GAIL
Johnny said he saw you at Fallout
last week. Said you were completely
hammered. On your own. He was
worried. Look, it’s none of my
business butCASSANDRA
He must have seen someone else. I’ve
never been there.
GAIL doesn’t buy this for a second. She studies CASSIE. But
she lets it go.
Ok.

GAIL

CASSIE ignores her.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - LATER
Bored, CASSIE is cleaning a table at the back of the coffee
shop. Two OLDER GUYS are sitting at a table, talking,
colleagues having a coffee after work, nicely dressed- clean
shaven. Respectable.
A young teenage girl, GABBY, maybe 13 or 14, walks in and
starts looking at the pastries on the shelf. The OLDER GUYS
immediately notice, start looking over at her- she’s wearing
jean shorts. One of them, JEFF, seems particularly distracted
by her.
GABBY notices the GUYS looking at her, you can feel her
immediately shift from confidence to self-consciousness. She
tugs down her shorts, the GUYS surreptitiously watching her.
She tries to ignore them. They’re not obviously perving, but
their interest in (and awareness of) GABBY is uncomfortable.
CASSANDRA goes behind the register.
CASSANDRA
What can I get you?
GABBY
Um. A hot chocolate please.
CASSANDRA starts making it. The men are now openly staring at
GABBY, whispering.
JEFF
I’d never let my daughter go out
looking like that. Nothing to the
imagination.

17

But the way he’s looking at her is not that of a concerned
parent.
CASSANDRA glares at him. She leans forward and whispers to
GABBY.
CASSANDRA
Do you want me to freak those
fuckers out?
GABBY glances over at them.

18

GABBY
(low)
No, no! Please don’t! Please don’t
say anything. Please.
She is bright red with embarrassment. Almost in tears.
CASSANDRA
It’s alright. Don’t worry. Don’t
worry about those creeps. Fuck ‘em.
She passes GABBY her drink.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
On the house.
GABBY
(small)
Thanks.
GABBY makes her way to the door trying to keep as far from
the table as she can while the men watch, sniggering.
CASSANDRA comes over to wipe their table and- oops!- she
knocks a hot coffee into JEFF’s lap.
He leaps up.
JESUS!

JEFF

CASSANDRA
Would you look at that! Right in the
crotch!
GABBY turns and stifles a smile at CASSANDRA as she leaves.
CASSANDRA winks at her.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Let me get you a fresh one, sir.
Hope I didn’t burn you.
He watches her go, furiously.
CUT TO:
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Later, in the middle of the night. We are under CASSANDRA’s
bed. The door opens, and she creeps in, we see just her bare
feet and bruised legs. She’s dressed not unlike the girl from
the cafe, rosy cheeks and hair clips.

19

She throws her shoes on the floor. She kneels down, reaches
under her bed and takes out a little book, with a pen tucked
into it, held together with a hair tie. She opens it up at
the back.
She has been counting something. There are rows and rows of
little tally marks. The odd line in a different colored ink:
whatever this is has been going on for a while. On the
opposite side: a row of men’s names.
She adds another line. And puts in the name: “JERRY”.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - DAY
CASSANDRA is looking after the coffee shop, reading an old
copy of ‘Careful How You Go’ by Lily Ann Frith. She yawns.
The bell jingles and a customer comes in- she ignores it.
MAN (O.S.)
Can I get a cappuccino please?
Mmm hmm.

CASSANDRA

She looks up at her customer. He’s her age, sweet, nicelooking. This is RYAN. She starts making his drink.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You want chocolate?
RYAN is staring at her.
What?
Cassandra?

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
RYAN

CASSANDRA stops what she’s doing.

Yes?

CASSANDRA
(warily)

RYAN
It’s Ryan Cooper. We were in the
same class together at Forrest!
Doctor Hadid’s class.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
Oh. Yeah. Ryan. Hi.

20

RYAN
(surprised)
God. What are you doing working
here?
CASSANDRA raises her eyebrows.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Wait. No. I’m so sorry. That was so
rude. I didn’t meanCASSANDRA
You didn’t mean what’s a promising
young woman like me doing working at
a shitty coffee shop?
RYAN
No, I didn’t mean...I just
thought...Oh man. There’s no way out
of this, is there?
Nu-uh.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
Can I go out and come back in again?
I can do better next time.
CASSANDRA
Did you want chocolate?
What?

RYAN

CASSANDRA
On your cappuccino?
No.

RYAN

(beat)
But you can spit in it if you want
to. I’d completely understand.
CASSANDRA looks him dead in the eyes and spits in it. She
hands it over. RYAN doesn’t know what to say exceptRYAN (CONT'D)
Do you want to go out sometime?
Beat.
What?

CASSANDRA

21

On a date?

RYAN

CASSANDRA
Seriously? I just spat in your
coffee.
RYAN looks her right back, and drinks it.
INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
CASSANDRA is putting on make-up in the mirror. She’s wearing
a tight slogan t-shirt, plaid shirt and tight jeans. Fake
lip-ring. The deadpan hipster dream girl. Her laptop is open,
and she is following a babbling make-up tutorial on youtube.
MAKE UP VLOGGER
OK so you just line your lips like
so. You always want your liner to be
darker than your gloss.
CASSANDRA lines her lips in porno pink.
MAKE UP VLOGGER (CONT'D)
Wonderful. Now add the gloss. I like
to use the cheaper glosses and save
the money for my highlighter and
base...
CASSANDRA puts on a pastel gloss.
MAKE UP VLOGGER (CONT'D)
And voila! The perfect Blow Job
Lips!
CASSANDRA looks at her reflection. She looks hot in a
highlighted, feather-eyed, Instagram way.
She takes her thumb to her lips and smudges the meticulouslyapplied lipstick all round her mouth.
CUT TO:
OMITTED
INT. NEIL’S APARTMENT - LATER
CASSANDRA sits precariously on the couch of a small, hipster
apartment. The decorating style is Lit-Student-chic: a poster
of a french movie, paperbacks stacked everywhere.

22

A record by the record player: “Jeau Dangereux” by Clarice
Bisset. A guitar. A dream catcher.
A breathy girl is singing Enrique Iglesias’ “Hero” in Spanish
on LP. NEIL, a pretentious 30-something who absolutely
describes himself as a “renaissance man”, racks up lines on a
glass table. CASSANDRA watches him.
NEIL
Seriously, you need to read it.
‘Consider The Lobster’ is one of the
fucking greats, man. Cracked my head
open...like...like a lobster claw.
He is momentarily awed by his own perceptiveness.
He takes a snort of coke.
NEIL (CONT'D)
You know I’m writing a novel. Well,
uh, kinda. I’m a perfectionist, you
know, it’s just taking forever. I
keep going over and over and over
it. Picking at it like a scab. It’s
about, I guess, what it is to be a
guy right now? Like, how to be a guy
in this world? Kinda a fucked-up,
dirty, low-life, love story. It’s
all set in New York over the course
of one night and it’s all, like,
interwoven first person strands
which...
CASSANDRA stares at him, glassy eyed.
NEIL (CONT'D)
You know what. I shouldn’t talk
about it. Don’t want to jinx it!
(beat)
You do coke, right?
CASSANDRA
Not really...
NEIL
Oh come on!
CASSANDRA
I got work in the morning...
NEIL
Eh. So do I.

23

He scrapes the coke onto a record and brings it over to her,
he gently sicks the note in her nostril. She looks at him,
unsure. Then after a moment, snorts a line messily.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Hey! You missed most of it, silly!
He licks his finger, getting the bits she missed and rubs it
in her gums. CASSANDRA stares at him as he does this. We have
the feeling she might bite his finger off. NEIL doesn’t
notice.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Yum. There you are.
He moves her hair from her face and looks at her.
NEIL (CONT'D)
You’re so, so pretty. Why are you
wearing all that make up? Do you
mind me asking that?
(not waiting for a
response)
I never understood why girls wear so
much make up. You all look way more
beautiful without it, you know? I
just feel like women feel so much
pressure to look a certain way now.
All the extensions and fake
eyelashes and porno nails. It’s
like, guys don’t even like it, you
know? It’s just a soul-sucking
system designed to oppress women.
(another line of coke)
I wanna see you. The real you. All
your freckles and imperfections.
He kisses her nose. She doesn’t respond. But we can see she
is a whisper from tearing his face off. FinallyCASSANDRA
I don’t feel good. Could you get me
a glass of water?
He looks at her for a sec.
NEIL
(frustrated)
Sure.

24

INT. NEIL'S APARTMENT - LATER
A few minutes later and NEIL is bringing back a glass of
water. CASSANDRA is passed out face down on the couch.
He looks at her, sleeping. He’s kind of annoyed. ThenHe nudges her.

Hey.

NEIL
(gentle)

She stirs.

Hey!

NEIL (CONT'D)
(louder)

She wakes.
NEIL (CONT'D)
(quiet again, sappy)
There you are! Hi. You fell asleep.
He gives her the water, she drinks it.
Good girl.

NEIL (CONT'D)

He takes the glass from her hand. Strokes her back.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Feel better?
No.

CASSANDRA

NEIL
You know, I nearly didn’t come out
tonight. I’m so glad I did. I feel
such a connection to you.
CASSANDRA
Could you call me a cab?
NEIL
You just got here!
CASSANDRA
I should go.

25

NEIL
Don’t go...come on...we’re having
fun, aren’t we?
He kisses her gently.
I...

CASSANDRA

NEIL
We can play hooky tomorrow, stay in
bed all day. I’ll make you
breakfast... Eggs Benedict. I make
my own...
(French pronunciation)
...hollandaise.
He kisses her neck. She is rigid. He ignores it.
NEIL (CONT'D)
You are so amazing.
His hand moves up her leg.
CASSANDRA
I need to go...
NEIL
(kissing)
You don’t wanna go home. C’mon.
His hand is up her skirt.
She drops the act.
Hey. Neil.

CASSANDRA

He ignores her. She grabs his face and stares into his eyes.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I said: I need to go home.
NEIL stares at her for a second and then jumps away from her.
Holy shit!

NEIL

He’s practically on the other side of the room.
What?

CASSANDRA

26

NEIL
Woah. What...what is this? Are you
some kind of psycho or something?
CASSANDRA
Why d’you say that?
NEIL
I thought you were...
Drunk?
Yeah!

CASSANDRA
NEIL

CASSANDRA
Really drunk?
He falters a little here.
NEIL
I guess...yeah.
CASSANDRA
Well, I’m not. But that’s good,
isn’t it?
NEIL is starting to panic.
NEIL
You should leave.
CASSANDRA
Oh now you want me to leave?
NEIL
No I...Look I’m really high. Like.
Really high. I don’t know what I’m
doing. You should go.
She walks towards him. He backs away from her.
CASSANDRA
I mean, a second ago you were
determined for me to stay. Pretty
insistent actually.
NEIL
(begging)
I’m a nice guyAre you?

CASSANDRA

27

BEAT.

28

NEIL
I thought we had a connection, I
guess.
CASSANDRA
A connection? OK. What do I do for a
living?
No response.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Sorry. Maybe that one’s too hard.
How old am I? How long have I lived
in the city? What are my hobbies?
(beat)
What’s my name?
NEIL cannot answer.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You’re right! This connection is
electric!
(beat)
Of course, I know all about you.
Your mom, your sister, your job at a
digital marketing agency which it
sounds like you completely suck at,
by the way, and, oh yeah...
(she stifles a smile)
Your novel. Good luck with that,
sounds like a winner. About a guy.
And set in New York? Woah.
NEIL
ALRIGHT. Alright. Fuck. I take your
point. What do you want from me? To
say I’m an asshole? Fine, I’m an
asshole.
CASSANDRA
Why are you so freaked out, Neil?
Wow. You really need to calm down.
She keeps coming closer. He’s scared.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
At least you didn’t try to have sex
with me while I was passed out. You
do get points for that. I want you
to be proud of yourself. A few
guys...eh they don’t mind so much.
But you, you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me. That
was sweet.

29

NEIL
What are you saying, that I’m some
kind of...predator?
CASSANDRA
I don’t know. Are you?
BEAT.
NEIL
(small)
I’m a nice guy.
CASSANDRA
(kind)
You keep saying that. And there are
plenty of nice guys just like you.
You’re not as rare as you’d think.
You know how I know?
No.

NEIL

CASSANDRA
Because every week I go to a club.
And every week I act like I’m too
drunk to stand. And Every. Fucking.
Week. A nice guy just like you comes
over to see if I’m ok.
NEIL is silent.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You wanna fuck me still?
NEIL
(lip wobbling)
No thank you.
CASSANDRA
Huh. No one ever does.
She opens his front door. ThenCASSANDRA (CONT'D)
This music is terrible. Only a drunk
person would have sex to this music.
She leaves. NEIL leans against the wall, shaking. His Spanish
LP playing softly in the background.

30

INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
CASSANDRA adds a little line to her book. Writes the name
“Neil”. She sighs. All those names. She looks over at a
picture on her bedside table. Two young girls hugging each
other. She smiles.
CASSANDRA
Night, Nina.
She turns out the light.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
CASSANDRA arrives at breakfast. STANLEY is reading the paper
silently, SUSAN is eating neatly. There’s a large, neatly
wrapped present in CASSANDRA’S place. She looks at her
father: nothing.
CASSANDRA
What’s this?
Silence.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Mom, what’s this?
SUSAN
What do you mean?
This gift!

CASSANDRA

Beat.
SUSAN
It’s your birthday, Cassie.
CASSANDRA had completely forgotten.
CASSANDRA
Oh... yeah.
There is a tense silence. SUSAN is suddenly on the verge of
tears.
STANLEY
(gentle, to SUSAN)
Hey...
SUSAN
What kind of person forgets their
30th birthday?

31

STANLEY
Sweetheart-

32

SUSAN
Don’t, Stanley.
CASSANDRA
It was a mistake, Mom. You know I’m
terrible with dates. It’s not a big
deal.
SUSAN
Not a big deal? Not a big deal. You
just forgot your birthday! Not a big
deal. Ok! You don’t want to have a
party? Don’t want to see your
friends?
CASSANDRA
(dry)
You know I don’t have any friends,
Mom.
SUSAN
Don’t joke about it! You know how
strange that is? You still living at
home, working in that stupid coffee
shop? Out all hours of the night
doing god only knows what. No
boyfriend. No friends.
CASSANDRA
Mom! You should have saved all this
for my birthday card!
STANLEY
Let the kid celebrate how she wants
toSUSAN
Celebrate! Is this a celebration?
(beat)
My friends all ask about you and I
don’t know what to tell them. All
their children are getting married,
having kids. I don’t know what
happened...
A tense silence. They all know what happened.
STANLEY
Why don’t you open your gift, honey?
CASSANDRA calmly opens her present. It is a large, beautiful
suitcase.

33

INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON
CASSANDRA and GAIL are unpacking boxes.
Woah.
Yeah.

GAIL
CASSANDRA

GAIL
That’s direct.
CASSANDRA
A reeeal kick in the cunt.
GAIL
Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
CASSANDRA
Oh yeah it’s definitely the fanciest
“get the fuck out of our house”
metaphor I’ve received so far.
Beat.
GAIL
Then why don’t you?
What?

CASSANDRA

GAIL
Get out of their house? Just...I
don’t know...go on Zillow, or Single
White Female some girl, or get a
basement room in a weird guy’s
house. Anything!
CASSANDRA
I can’t afford it, Gail. Not on what
you pay me. Not even a weird guy’s
basement.
GAIL
So take this other job then. Take
any job.
CASSANDRA
Are you firing me?
GAIL
Maybe I should.

34

Beat.

35

CASSANDRA
Look. You’re making the assumption
that I want any of it. If I wanted a
boyfriend and a yoga class and a
house and kids and a job my mom
could brag about I’d have done it.
You don’t think I could walk into
any bar in this city wearing an
adorable floral dress and get all
that for myself? It would take me
ten minutes. I don’t want it.
GAIL
But you must want something?
Beat.
Suddenly, the door opens. RYAN walks into the coffee shop.
CASSANDRA
Oh. You. Hi.
RYAN
Hey. Cappuccino please. Hold the
spit.
GAIL watches, intrigued.
RYAN (CONT'D)
So I just wanted to come in because
I think you gave me a fake number
the other day.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
That doesn’t sound like me.
RYAN
Which meant that I spent hours
composing a witty, romantic text and
sent it to a oil rig worker called
Red.
CASSANDRA
Was he into it?
RYAN
Surprisingly into it. But we
couldn’t make it work because of,
y’know, the oil rig so...I thought
I’d try you again.

36

GAIL
Oh! Did I just hear the phone ring
in the back?
No.

CASSANDRA

GAIL
Yup. I’m sure I did.
GAIL goes out back.
CASSANDRA
She has to take a few imaginary
calls a day.
RYAN
Look, I don’t want to bother you so
if you’re not into this then I
totally get it.
CASSANDRA
I’m not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.
RYAN
Ok. Fair enough.
(then-)
Can I tempt you into a friendship
with a man who is secretly pining
after you?
CASSANDRA laughs.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Dating is horrible. Everyone is
horrible. I went to dinner with a
woman last month who wanted to
euthanize the homeless.
CASSANDRA
You went on a date with my mom?
RYAN
I like you. I can’t stop thinking
about you spitting in my coffee.
Have lunch with me this weekend.
Please. If you hate it we can have a
safe word and you can leave, no
questions asked.
CASSANDRA considers it.

37

INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
CASSANDRA is wearing a pretty, slightly-too-short floral
dress. She creeps across the hallway, trying to avoid her
parents who are watching tv in the tv room.
SUSAN (O.S.)
You’re dressed up.
Busted.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Where are you going?
CASSANDRA
I’m going out for lunch.
Her parents look at her, surprised.
With who?
A friend.

SUSAN
CASSANDRA

STANLEY
You look very pretty.
CASSANDRA is a little shy suddenly.
CASSANDRA
Thanks, dad.
She leaves. Her parents look at one another. They can barely
dare to hope.
INT. THE HAWT DOG - DAY
CASSANDRA and RYAN are mid-date and it’s going well.
CASSANDRA
How did she get a skeleton’s hand up
there?
RYAN
She stole it from a teaching model.
And here’s the worst part, she
looked at me right in the eyes, took
it out ...and waved it at me.
CASSANDRA pushes her food away.

38

CASSANDRA
And I am done.
RYAN
And I am wondering why I started
telling that story...

39

CASSANDRA
Hey, there is nothing more romantic
than a disturbed woman pulling a
skeleton’s hand out of her vagina.
RYAN
That’s true.
CASSANDRA
People never pull anything out of
anywhere where I work.
RYAN
So, yeah, you didn’t want to...
What?

CASSANDRA

RYAN
Carry on with med school?
CASSANDRA goes back to her food.
Nah.
Why not?

CASSANDRA
RYAN

CASSANDRA
I wanted to do something else.
RYAN
Really? What?
CASSANDRA
I don’t know.
RYAN
You were so good though. You knew
everything.
CASSANDRA
I didn’t know everything.
RYAN
You did! You were brilliant! I was
terrible. Remember when I
accidentally removed the wrong
kidney from my cadaver?

40

CASSANDRA
(proud)
And look at you now. Operating on
children.
RYAN laughs.
RYAN
Yeah. I got better. But you, you
were always way ahead of everybody.
You’d have been a fantastic doctor.
CASSANDRA
Just. Didn’t want it anymore, I
guess.
CASSANDRA shrugs. RYAN senses he’s crossed a line.
RYAN
Hey, you want coffee? Movie starts
in half an hour. I can tell you
about the guy who got his dick
trapped in a tambourine.
EXT. RYAN’S APARTMENT - EVENING
RYAN and CASSANDRA are walking down the street. There’s a
somewhat awkward, expectant silence.
RYAN
You think we look like father and
daughter from behind?
CASSANDRA laughs.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I always worry about that.
Bystanders screaming when I lean in
to kiss someone. “Get your hands of
that child...oh...sorry sir.”
CASSANDRA
I mean, don’t be so tall would be my
argument. It’s kind of...flashy.
Yeah?

RYAN

CASSANDRA
Showing off.
He laughs.

41

RYAN
Oh. This is a weird coincidence.
What?

CASSANDRA

RYAN
I think this is...yep! Huh. This is
my apartment.
CASSANDRA immediately cools. The wall goes right up.
CASSANDRA
That is weird. What a weird, weird
coincidence.
RYAN
I mean...since we’re already here.
You wanna come up for a drink? I
could clumsily try to seduce you?
CASSANDRA
(coldly)
Sure. Why not.

42

RYAN
Oh. It’s too soon, I’m sorry. I
shouldn’t haveCASSANDRA
Nope. Let’s go upstairs.
RYAN
I don’t want you to come up unless
you want to. I’m not... look, I
misread what was happening, I’m
sorry. Let me drive you home.
They start walking in silence, CASSANDRA is kicking herself.
She stops.
CASSANDRA
You know what. You’re at your place.
I can get a cab.
RYAN
Are you sure? ButI’m sure.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
I feel like I fucked this up. I’m
sorry. What can ICASSANDRA
You didn’t. It’s not you.
CASSANDRA walks off. RYAN watches, confused. He lets himself
in.
Further down the street, CASSANDRA is almost in tears of
frustration, she kicks over a garbage can, tipping its
contents over the street.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Breakfast. Everyone in their spot. CASSANDRA looks hollowed
out.
STANLEY
Did you and your friend have a nice
time?
Beat.
Mmm hmm.

CASSANDRA

43

STANLEY
You came in pretty late!
Yep.

CASSANDRA

SUSAN
You two go dancing?
BEAT.
Yep.

CASSANDRA

SUSAN and STANLEY exchange excited glances. CASSANDRA pulls
her sweater sleeve over a nightclub stamp on her hand, and on
her wrist, a significant bruise.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - DAY
CASSANDRA is staring into space, worrying she’s made a
mistake with RYAN. A gorgeous COUPLE sit in the corner. They
are laughing hysterically.
GAIL
Ew. Look at them. Take your
happiness elsewhere please.
CASSANDRA looks over at them.
CASSANDRA
You and Richard must have been like
that at some point.
GAIL thinks.
GAIL
He did make me laugh. Lucky for him
I find farting hilarious otherwise
we’d have been over after the first
date.
CASSANDRA
He farted on the first date?
GAIL
I made him laugh so hard he farted.
CASSANDRA
Fuck.
(beat)
That is so romantic.

44

INT. BATHORY HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM -

EVENING

A red balloon floats in the corner of a ceiling.
We reveal CASSANDRA looking up at it. She’s sitting in a
hospital waiting room with a few patients.
Cassie!

RYAN (O.S.)

She looks up, RYAN is walking over to her.
RYAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing here?
She stands.
CASSANDRA
I just came to pick up my herpes
medication.
RYAN
You have herpes too. That saves us
an awkward conversation later.
The MOTHER of a tragic-looking CHILD PATIENT looks over
disapprovingly.
CASSANDRA
So. I came here to see you.
Obviously.
(deep breath)
I’m not good at this stuff. I’m
trying.
RYAN
If you’re not interestedCASSANDRA
No it’s not that.
You sure?

RYAN

She nods.
CASSANDRA
(huge effort)
So, I’d like to see you again...if
that’s cool. But we’ll need to take
it slow. I understand ifRYAN
Of course that’s cool.

45

Thank you.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
What are you doing now? You wanna go
somewhere? Get dinner?

46

CASSANDRA
Aren’t you working?
RYAN
Eh, it’s only a kid with leukemia.
He can wait.
(beat)
I’m kidding. My shift has finished.
Let me just get my stuff.
CASSANDRA is watching him, she can barely stop smiling.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - DAY
GAIL and CASSANDRA are cleaning the shop listening to the
radio. CASSANDRA starts humming along. GAIL stares at her.
Oh my god.
What?

GAIL
CASSANDRA

GAIL
Are you seeing that guy?
No!

CASSANDRA

Beat.
GAIL
Good for you.
CASSANDRA feigns outrage, but is delighted.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - EVENING
RYAN is waiting at a table a little awkwardly as GAIL
scrutinizes him.
CASSANDRA locks up.
GAIL
You ever kill someone?
What?

RYAN

GAIL
You know, operating on them.

47

No!
Really?

RYAN
GAIL

RYAN
I mean...patients have died during
surgery, of courseGAIL
So that’s a yes.
CASSANDRA
Gail! Stop asking Ryan if he’s
killed anyone!
GAIL nonchalantly removes the remaining coffee cups from the
table as Cassie comes over to sit with Ryan.
GAIL
I’ll stop asking him when he stops
killing people.
RYAN
That does seem fair.
GAIL
Ok. I’m leaving you lovebirds to it.
Can you lock up, honey?
Course.

CASSANDRA

GAIL puts the cups on the counter.
GAIL
If you have sex on the counter, the
bleach is in the back room. I don’t
want to find ass prints in the
coffee grinds tomorrow morning.
(bright)
Night!
She leaves the coffee shop. RYAN and CASSIE sit awkwardly.
RYAN
She seems nice!
CASSIE laughs.
CASSANDRA
She is. She’s a good friend.

48

RYAN
Are you friends with anyone from
Forrest still?
Beat.
No.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
Really? No one?
CASSANDRA
Really. No one.
RYAN
I can’t seem to shake them off.
CASSANDRA
(ew)
You still hang out with those guys?
RYAN
They’re not that bad! You know
Madison McPhee just had twins?
Beat.
CASSANDRA
I don’t remember Madison.
RYAN
I thought you were close?
Nope.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
Huh. Oh yeah, oh my god, Al Monroe
is marrying some kind of model. She
was in a some MTV rich girl show.
Small part- but still! Classic Al.
Landing on his feet.
CASSANDRA tries to keep calm.
Al Monroe?

CASSANDRA

RYAN
You must remember himCASSANDRA
I thought he moved to London.

49

RYAN
He moved back here a couple of
months ago.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
Do you see him a lot?
RYAN
We’re not close anymore but... he’s
in the group. And we cross paths
because of work. He’s an
anesthesiologist now.
CASSANDRA
(deadpan)
Good for him. And he’s getting
married?
RYAN
I know. God help her!
RYAN laughs. CASSANDRA tries to cover her shock.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
CASSANDRA is in her bedroom trying to avoid looking at the
laptop on her desk. She’s trying to stay calm, but we can
feel the tension building.
To stop herself, she reaches for the book under the bed, and
looks at the tally marks. She counts them like a mantra under
her breath.
CASSANDRA
One two three four five six seven
eight nine...
It’s not working. She finally goes to the computer and opens
it. Dreading what she’ll see.
Shaking, she types in Al Monroe’s name into the search bar. A
few options come up, she scrolls through them until- there he
is.
She clicks.
Beautiful home, beautiful fiancee, beautiful car, beautiful
holidays: a beautiful life.

50

She scrolls through his photos compulsively, and finds one of
him and his gorgeous fiancee, her showing off her engagement
ring. CASSANDRA reads the blurb Al has written underneath it:
“SO HUMBLED TO BE MARRYING MY BEST FRIEND, AND THE LOVE OF MY
LIFE. DOESN’T HURT THAT SHE’S A BIKINI MODEL EITHER
LOLOLOL!!!!”
She scrolls down to the comments beneath the photo. “WAY TO
GO BRO!!!”, “OMG YOU GUYS!!”.
She stops at one comment:
“I cannot believe my two favorite people in the worrrrld are
getting hitched!!!”
CASSANDRA clicks on the girl who wrote it, MADISON MCPHEE.
She’s CASSANDRA’s age. Very pretty, married with two adorable
twins. Like AL, she is living a middle class dream life.
She shouldn’t have looked.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Later CASSANDRA lies in bed, wide awake. She sits up. Gets
her notebook out.
She opens her computer, goes back to AL’s page.
She turns to a fresh page in her book, and starts to write.
An idea is forming.
She combs Facebook, looking at photos, writing things down,
taking notes. And then she clicks on an event“AL MONROE’S LAST WEEKEND AS A FREE MAN”
It’s AL’s bachelor party.
“LOCATION TBC BITCHEEEEES”
Thinking. She writes something down.
Then she goes back to MADISON MCPHEE’s page.
And clicks the “Send Private Message” button. She smiles.
INT. HOTEL ST. JOAN RESTAURANT - DAY
CASSANDRA sits in a upmarket hotel restaurant. She is dressed
for success, her hair has been blown out.

51

A waiter, ALFRED, brings over a champagne bottle and a ginger
ale.
ALFRED
Welcome to the Hotel St Joan, miss.
Thank you.

CASSANDRA

ALFRED
One ginger ale, and one bottle of
champagne.
He begins to pour the champagne.
CASSANDRA
Don’t worry. I can do that.
ButThank you.

ALFRED
CASSANDRA

ALFRED leaves. CASSANDRA pours champagne into the glass
opposite hers, and fills her own champagne glass with the
ginger ale: it looks exactly like champagne. She puts the
ginger ale bottle discreetly under her chair.
Cassie?

MADISON (O.S.)

CASSANDRA looks up. There is MADISON. She’s gorgeous- wearing
tasteful but obviously very expensive clothes. On the surface
MADISON is all warmth and sunshine, but is one of those
people who has a way of making every compliment sound like a
burn.
CASSANDRA
Madison. Hi.
MADISON
Oh my gooooooood! You look amazing!
I almost didn’t recognize you!
They hug, and sit back down.
CASSANDRA
Thank you.
(beat)
You look exactly the same.

52

MADISON
You’re sweet! I look so OLD. That’s
what having twins will do to you.
Tragic. Do you have kids?
No.

CASSANDRA

MADISON gives a sympathetic pout.
MADISON
You’ll get there!
She sees the champagne.
MADISON (CONT'D)
Champagne? What are we drinking to?
CASSANDRA
To old friends.
They clink.
INT. HOTEL ST. JOAN RESTAURANT - LATER
The room is thinning out. ALFRED supervises as BUSBOY clears
the table after what has obviously been a long lunch. MADISON
is pretty drunk and gabbling.
MADISON
I thought I’d be literally bored out
of my skull looking after the kids.
But it’s great actually!
CASSIE pours the last dregs of a bottle of red into MADISON’S
glass. CASSIE’s own glass is still full- MADISON hasn’t
noticed.
MADISON (CONT'D)
Oh! Out already?
(to ALFRED)
Can we get another one?
A flicker of disapproval from ALFRED as he takes away the
empty bottle.
MADISON (CONT'D)
I haven’t been day drunk in forever!
So fun!
So fun!

CASSANDRA

53

MADISON continues.
MADISON
TBH, I know guys always say they
want their wives to work, but it’s
not true.
Really?

CASSANDRA

MADISON
They all want a feminist in college
because it’s cool to have a
girlfriend who cares about
something. And feminists are
statistically more likely do analthat’s a literal fact by the waybut when it comes down to it, all
guys want the same thing.

54

CASSANDRA
And what’s that?
MADISON
A good girl.
CASSANDRA
I don’t seem to remember you were
that much of a good girl at college!
A new bottle is set down in front of them. MADISON fills up
her glass as she talks.
MADISON
Fred didn’t know me at college. He
met me when I was working at
L'Oréal.
Poor Fred!

CASSANDRA

MADISON
What he doesn’t know won’t kill him,
right? But d’you know the really
gross part?
She leans in.
MADISON (CONT'D)
I love it. I thought I’d miss my job
but...I really don’t. I love being a
housewife. It’s a turn-on actually.
MADISON looks at her glass. She is getting super drunk.
MADISON (CONT'D)
Jeez. How much have I had of this?
Such a lightweight.
CASSANDRA
I’m glad everything’s worked out so
well for you, Madison.
MADISON
Thanks. It really has.
Yeah.
BEAT.

CASSANDRA

55

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You know. I actually wanted to meet
today, to talk about something in
particular.

56

MADISON
I did wonder. No one has heard from
you in, like, forever.
CASSANDRA
I wanted to talk to you about why I
dropped out.
MADISON takes nervous a swallow of her drink.
Ok. Sure.

MADISON

CASSANDRA
You remember what happened, right?
MADISON
It was such a long time ago now...
CASSANDRA
I know. But you remember?
MADISON is uncomfortable.
MADISON
I mean...vaguely.
CASSANDRA
Do you ever think about it?
Beat.
MADISON
Why would I?
CASSANDRA
Right. Why would you.
MADISON is already starting to shift in her chair, she’s
slightly too drunk to handle what’s about to happen.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
If a friend came to you now,
tomorrow, let’s say, if they turned
up at your house tomorrow morning,
and told you that they thought
something had happened to them the
night before, something badCassie-

MADISON

CASSANDRA
-something bad. What would you say?

57

MADISON
It was years ago...
CASSANDRA
What would you say?
MADISON
It’s complicated...Ugh. I feel a
little...weird. I’m sorry.
MADISON is getting drunker and drunker by the minute.
CASSANDRA
Would you roll your eyes behind her
back and dismiss the whole thing as
drama?
MADISON
I don’t know why you’re mad at me!
It wasn’t just me who didn’t believe
it! When you have a reputation for
sleeping around then maybe people
won’t believe you when you say
something’s happened! I mean...it’s
crying wolf.
CASSANDRA
You thought it was crying wolf?
MADISON
I don’t make the rules, ok? If you
get that drunk things happen! Don’t
get blackout hammered every night
and then expect people to be on your
side when you have sex with someone
you didn’t want to!
She shouts this a little louder than she meant to, a few
diners turn to look. She’s sloppy drunk. CASSANDRA studies
her for a while, thenCASSANDRA
That’s a shame. I was hoping you’d
feel differently.
MADISON shrugs.
Sorry.

MADISON

CASSANDRA
For your sake. I really was hoping
you’d feel differently by now.

58

MADISON
You’re mad. I... Why don’t I get the
check? My treat.
MADISON tries to get her purse, she’s so drunk, she’s having
trouble.
CASSANDRA
You ok, Madison?
MADISON
Yeah...no. I’ve drunk too much. How
did I...my head is spinning.
MADISON knocks over her glass.
MADISON (CONT'D)
Oh my god. Shit.
CASSANDRA gets up, throws some cash down on the table.
CASSANDRA
Nice seeing you again.
She looks down at MADISON, who is struggling to see straight.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You really haven’t changed at all.
She leaves.
INT. HOTEL ST. JOAN RESTAURANT - BAR - MOMENTS LATER
CASSANDRA walks up to TONY, a well-dressed, handsome young
man who has been sitting at the bar. She gets an envelope out
of her purse, and a room key.
So...?

TONY

CASSANDRA
She’s over there.
She points to MADISON, and hands him the envelope and key.
Room 25.

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)

TONY
You sure about this?

59

CASSANDRA
(ice cold)
I’m sure.

60

She leaves the hotel. TONY, disturbed, watches her go.
INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - DAY
On CASSIE’S phone vibrating. It’s MADISON. It rings off, and
reveals: 13 MISSED CALLS. CASSANDRA looks down at the phone
impassively. A few seconds as she thinks what to do. ThenShe picks up her phone, and dials. Voicemail.
MADISON (O.S.)
Cassie...hi...wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday...blast from the
past! Uh...hey I was pretty drunk, I
can’t...really
....look did you see me talking to a
guy? Like...our age...Just trying to
piece some things together...
CASSANDRA skips to the next message.
MADISON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Cassie, sorry, please call me
back...I freaking out a
little...just...will you call me..?
I woke up in one of the hotel rooms
...I think something might have
happened...
CASSANDRA hangs up, emotionless. She gets her book from out
of her bag.
CASSANDRA opens it: she crosses out a name: MADISON. On rest
of the page we glimpse a few notes: “Hotel St Joan” a phone
number, another name “Tony”, another number.
She looks at the next name on the list: WALKER.
I/E. CAR - SANTA LUCIA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
CASSIE sits inside her car, listening to sugary pop music.
It’s a mess- full of papers and a huge, professional-looking
make-up bag. Her book is there too, among the debris. She
looks different, hair in a pony tail, pink cardigan: pretty,
young and un-threatening.
She’s parked outside a high school, watching teenaged girls
as they leave at the end of the day, giggling and talking.

61

A girl walks out with her Queen Bee friends. She’s superbeautiful, long shiny hair, she looks older than her fifteen
years. This is AMBER. Her phone beeps and she stops to look
at it- her friends leave.
AMBER
See you tomorrow, bitches.
She’s alone. CASSANDRA leans over and gets her attention.

62

CASSANDRA
Excuse me? Hi! Sorry! Excuse me!
AMBER looks over.
Me?
Yeah!
What’s up?

AMBER
CASSANDRA
AMBER

CASSANDRA
I’m so sorry to bother you- my phone
has died and I’m really late for
work. Do you live round here? You
know the area?
AMBER
(impatient)
I guess.
CASSANDRA
Can you tell me how to get to the
Castle Diner?
AMBER
Sorry. I’m late, so...
AMBER begins to walk off.
CASSANDRA
Wait! Please, I’m supposed to be
shooting this music video and I’ve
got to getAMBER
Music video?
CASSANDRA
Yeah. I’m a make-up artist and it’s
my first time working with these
guys and if I’m late I may as wellAMBER looks into the car. She sees CASSANDRA’s papers, they
are covered in headshots and info on “WetDreams”, a One
Direction-style boyband.
Oh my god.

AMBER

CASSANDRA hastily covers the papers.

63

AMBER (CONT'D)
OH MY GOD. Are you working for
WetDreams?? OH MY GOD!!!!
CASSANDRA
You didn’t see that.
AMBER
I know where the Castle Diner is!
CASSANDRA
Don’t worry about it! I’ll ask
someone else!
AMBER
No way! NO WAY! Are they there? Oh
my god. ARE THEY THERE?
CASSANDRA
Look, keep your voice down, please.
AMBER
I can direct you! Please, please,
please!
Sorry, no-

CASSANDRA

AMBER
(smug)
If I don’t come and direct you then
how will you find it?
CASSANDRA thinks, she’s desperate.
CASSANDRA
I can’t. If you tell anyone or post
this online I’ll never work again.
AMBER
I swear I won’t. I swear. Take my
phone!! Seriously.
She holds out her phone. CASSANDRA relents.
CASSANDRA
Oh god. OK get in. But you have to
be cool about this.
AMBER
OF COURSE I WILL!!!
AMBER gets in. She hands over her phone to CASSIE- it’s got a
sparkly “WetDreams” phone case.

64

CASSANDRA
Woah. You really are a fan.
AMBER
I’m ob-sessed. I have a whole Insta
dedicated to George’s dog.
CASSANDRA
What a crazy coincidence.
AMBER
You know what. This is fate.
CASSANDRA
Sure seems like it, doesn’t it?
CASSANDRA pockets AMBER’S phone and starts the engine. AMBER
looks out of her window, almost dying of excitement: she only
has a second to register the car doors locking.
EXT. FORREST UNIVERSITY - DAY
CASSANDRA strides past a “Forrest University” sign, marching
through GRAD STUDENTS toward the building’s doors.
INT. FORREST UNIVERSITY WAITING ROOM - DAY
CASSANDRA disdainfully reads the cheesy university’s
prospectus. Slogan: “Forrest University: Where All Your
Beginnings Begin!”. The secretary, JEAN, calls over to
CASSANDRA.
JEAN
Dean Walker is ready if you’d like
to go on through.
CASSANDRA gets up.
INT. FORREST UNIVERSITY - DEAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
A gorgeous, wood-paneled office. Behind the desk is DEAN
WALKER, a well-dressed and polished woman in her latefifties. She has the patient warmth of a psychiatrist: a
woman used to smoothing over her students problems. A kind,
clever and reasonable person.
Daisy?
That’s me.

DEAN WALKER
CASSANDRA

65

DEAN WALKER
Come in. Welcome.

66

CASSANDRA sits down. DEAN WALKER consults her notes.
DEAN WALKER (CONT'D)
My assistant tells me you’re
thinking of resuming med school.
CASSANDRA
That’s right.
DEAN WALKER
So what prompted this desire to
finish your studies now, if you
don’t mind my asking?
CASSANDRA
Not at all. I guess... I couldn’t
stop thinking about my time here.
DEAN WALKER
It’s an extraordinary place. Of
course, we’d love to accommodate you
if we can. But, you have to
understand, this is a little
unusual.
CASSANDRA
Yes. But I left in unusual
circumstances.
DEAN WALKER looks at her blankly.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I left because of what happened to
Nina.
Nothing.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Nina Fisher.
DEAN WALKER
I’m so sorry, I’m not following you.
CASSANDRA
You don’t remember her?
DEAN WALKER
We have so many students. I wish I
could remember them all by name.
ButCASSANDRA
Then maybe you remember Alexander
Monroe, Al Monroe?

67

DEAN WALKER
Oh yes! Of course I remember
Alexander! He came and did a talk
for our students not long ago. Nice
guy. Very smart. Is he a friend of
yours?
CASSANDRA
No. So, you don’t remember the
accusations made against Al Monroe?
DEAN WALKER frowns- she genuinely can’t remember.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
He took a girl- Nina Fisher, the
girl you don’t remember- back to his
dorm where he had sex with her,
repeatedly and in front of his
friends, while she was too drunk to
have any idea what was going on.
I don’t-

DEAN WALKER

CASSANDRA
She was covered in bruises the next
day. Handprints, I guess you could
say.
DEAN WALKER takes this very seriously.
DEAN WALKER
I’m so sorry. That is terrible. Was
it reported?
Yes.

CASSANDRA

DEAN WALKER
Who did Nina go to?
DEAN WALKER opens her book to note it down.
You.

CASSANDRA

DEAN WALKER is silent. She puts her pen down.
Oh.

DEAN WALKER

CASSANDRA
But you can’t remember so...

68

DEAN WALKER looks at CASSANDRA sympathetically.

69

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
You felt there wasn’t sufficient
evidence. It was too much of a ‘he
said/she said’ situation. You
thought that his version of events
seemed, what word did you
use...”credible”.
DEAN WALKER is genuinely saddened.
DEAN WALKER
(gentle)
We get so many of these accusations.
There’s usually one or two a weekone every morning early in semester
when everyone’s partying. I have to
take each claim on its own merits.
I’m so sorry that I don’t remember
this individual case, but I can
assure you that I would have looked
into it thoroughly at the time.
CASSANDRA
His friends were all watching,
laughing. Some of them maybe even
joined in.
DEAN WALKER
I understand it must be very hard.
But if Nina was drinking, if she
couldn’t remember fully, it’s
terribly complicated.
CASSANDRA
So she shouldn’t have been drunk?
DEAN WALKER
I don’t mean that. I just mean that
it isn’t always a good idea to go
back to a dorm room full of boys
after a party. It gives them the
wrong idea...We do advise against
it. We try to warn girls to be more
careful. To teach them about selfrespect.
CASSANDRA
So it was her fault? For not
respecting herself?
(beat)
Sorry! I don’t mean to sound
critical, Dean Walker. I just want
to be clear.

70

DEAN WALKER
(kind)
None of us wants to admit when we’ve
made ourselves vulnerable. And
sometimes these kind of mistakes are
very damaging. It’s much more common
than you’d know.
CASSANDRA
I know how common it is.
DEAN WALKER
Of course, it’s...regrettable.
CASSANDRA
Regrettable?
DEAN WALKER
(patient, kind)
What would you have me do? Ruin a
young man’s life every time an
accusation is made? Have them
expelled? That wouldn’t be fair.
Accusations like this, they ruin
lives.
CASSANDRA
So you’re happy to take the boy’s
word for it?
DEAN WALKER
I have to give them the benefit of
the doubt, yes.
CASSANDRA
Of course you do.
DEAN WALKER
Innocent until proven guilty. It has
to be.
CASSANDRA
No arguing with that.
DEAN WALKER
I’m afraid not.
CASSANDRA gets up.
CASSANDRA
Thank you for your time.

71

DEAN WALKER
I wish I could do more. Is your
friend ok?
CASSANDRA
No. She’s not. But Al Monroe is,
you’ll be glad to know he’s doing
really well. He’s getting married.
DEAN WALKER doesn’t respond.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
So you did the right thing, I guess.
We have to give these boys the
benefit of the doubt.
Beat.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
That’s why I know that you won’t
mind thatShe glances at her watch.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
-three hours ago I picked your
daughter Amber up from school and
introduced her to the boys who live
in that dorm now.
BEAT.
DEAN WALKER
What did you say?
CASSANDRA
She is really pretty, huh? And she
looks a lot older than she is.
DEAN WALKER
I don’t believe you.
DEAN WALKER is trying not to panic.
CASSANDRA
I noticed that they had a few
bottles of vodka in their room too.
But I’m sure they’ll take good care
of your daughter. She seemed excited
to meet them actually!
DEAN WALKER
Is this a joke? What is wrong with
you? You’re sick!

72

DEAN WALKER, shaking, picks up her phone, tries her
daughter’s cell.
CASSANDRA’s pocket rings.
The DEAN looks at her, horrified.
CASSANDRA
Oh right! Here it is. She’ll be
wanting that later.
She gets the phone out of her pocket and places it down on
DEAN WALKER’S desk. DEAN WALKER stares at it dumbly as what
this means sinks in.
DEAN WALKER
Oh my god. Are you crazy?
No.

CASSANDRA

DEAN WALKER
Which room is she in?? Tell me right
now! What kind of monster are you?
TELL ME?
CASSANDRA
I told you. The same room Nina was
in.
DEAN WALKER is totally freaking out.
DEAN WALKER
I don’t remember it! I already
said...
CASSANDRA
That’s a shame. Then I sure hope
you’re right to trust those boys!
DEAN WALKER
I’m calling the police.
She picks up the phone.
CASSANDRA
It’ll take them a while to get
here... you think there’s time?
The Dean is in tears.

73

DEAN WALKER
Please... she’s just a little girl.
CASSANDRA
I wonder if she looks so little to
those guys...
DEAN WALKER
JUST FUCKING TELL ME!!
CASSANDRA raises her eyebrows. DEAN WALKER has shocked
herself. She switches tack, starts begging.
DEAN WALKER (CONT'D)
Look, you’re right, OK? Is that what
you want to hear? You’re right.
She means it.
DEAN WALKER (CONT'D)
You’re right!
Beat.
CASSANDRA
See. Look how easy it was! You just
needed to think about it properly,
didn’t you? I guess it feels
different when it’s someone you
love.
DEAN WALKER
Please tell me which room she’s in.
CASSANDRA waits. Watches her panic. Lets her freak out for a
moment more. ThenCASSANDRA
Hey! Relax! Honestly, Dean Walker!
Did you really think I’d do
something like that? Luckily I don’t
have as much faith in college boys
as you do!
(beat)
Amber is sitting in a diner waiting
for her favorite boyband to turn up
for a music video. It’s the Castle
Diner if you want to call and check.
You should probably call actually,
otherwise she’ll never figure out
they’re not coming.
(beat)
She’s kind of an idiot, huh?
(MORE)

74

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Gorgeous though. Who needs brains?
They never did a girl any good.
DEAN WALKER is shivering with shock. Mute. CASSANDRA opens
the door.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
There’s a girl outside in the
waiting room. I hope you’ll listen
to her if she’s coming to talk to
you about something serious.
(beat)
Good to see you again, Dean Walker.
CASSANDRA leaves. DEAN WALKER watches her go.
INT. CAR - DAY
Close on CASSANDRA. Wagner’s “Liebestod” play on the radio.
She’s sitting with her face against the steering wheel. She’s
almost in a fugue state. What the hell did she just do?
Through the music, she becomes aware of a loud honking. It’s
been going on for a while. She comes out of her daze, asA guy in a pick-up truck, GEORGE, screeches up beside her. He
honks and yells at her through his window.
GEORGE
Hey! HEY! What are you doing?
She ignores him.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You’re sitting in the middle of the
road. Are you retarded or something?
She ignores him.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Hey! I’m talking to you, look at me
when I’m talking to you!
CASSANDRA grabs a wheel lock from the passenger seat and
calmly gets out of her car.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
What are you...?
She goes over to his car and matter-of-factly smashes one of
his break lights. He can’t believe what’s happening.

75

GEORGE (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing?
She smashes in the other break light. She comes around to the
front.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Hey! HEY! STOP! STOP!
She smashes his windscreen.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You crazy fucking bitch!
CASSANDRA goes around to his window, holding the wheel lock
threateningly.
CASSANDRA
(calm)
What did you call me?
He looks at her. He actually looks scared.
Fuck you!

GEORGE

He speeds away. Leaving her standing in the middle of the
road, surrounded by glass, completely shocked by what just
happened.
EXT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - EVENING
CASSANDRA gets out of her car to find RYAN waiting outside
her house. She’s still on the edge, in no state of mind to
see him.
CASSANDRA
Ryan! What are you...?
RYAN
You weren’t picking up your phone
so...
She realizes.
CASSANDRA
Shit. The movie. I’m so sorry. I had
to work late.
RYAN
Yeah. I went past the coffee shop,
Gail said you took the afternoon
off.

76

CASSANDRA doesn’t know what to say.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Everything alright?
She’s desperate to get away.

77

CASSANDRA
It’s fine. Yeah. Sorry. I’m just in
the middle of something...
RYAN
Ok. We can still make it if we skip
dinnerCASSANDRA
(terse)
I’m really tired. Can I just call
you tomorrow?
RYAN’s a little hurt but covers it.
RYAN
Sure.
(beat)
You sure you’re ok? You seem kind
of...
What?
Wired.

CASSANDRA
RYAN

CASSANDRA
I’m fine. Too much coffee. Don’t
work in a coffee shop.
RYAN
Right.
(beat)
Goodnight then, I guess.
Night.

CASSANDRA

RYAN gets into his car. A little annoyed.
OMITTED
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
SUSAN is sitting at the table, reading a magazine. CASSANDRA
tries to creep past without stopping. No chance.

78

SUSAN
Hey! Did you catch that boy outside?
CASSANDRA reluctantly enters.
Yeah.

CASSANDRA

SUSAN
He seems nice.
He is.

CASSANDRA

CASSANDRA turns to go.
SUSAN
Come on. You just got in. Sit down.
CASSANDRA sits. SUSAN is steeling herself for something.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Are you going to be ok now?
CASSANDRA
What do you mean?
SUSAN
Is this boy...is he making you feel
better? I’m sorry to pry. It’s
just...we’ve tried everything. Me
and your dad.
CASSANDRA
Please, Mom. Please can we not talk
about this now. Please.
A silence.
SUSAN
We have to talk about it someday.
(beat)
We think about her all the time too,
you know. She practically lived here
when you two were girls. If you
think that it didn’t affect us...
Beat.
CASSANDRA
Then why didn’t you ever talk about
it?

79

SUSAN
Because you were so angry, Cassie.
We couldn’t come near you. You have
no idea what it’s like, your anger.
CASSANDRA
Of course I’m angry!
SUSAN
But...it’s taken over everything.
(beat)
And whatever you do at night... You
don’t need to tell me what it is...
but...it seemed to work for a while.
And then...
SUSAN spreads out her hands.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
So if this boy is making you feel
good then, oh god, Cassie...
SUSAN starts to cry.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
I just want you to be happy. I want
you to feel better.
CASSANDRA reaches for her mother’s hand kindly.
CASSANDRA
Momma.
(cold)
Nothing makes me feel better.
She leaves.
INT. BLUE STAR BAR - NIGHT
Close in on CASSANDRA, on edge, dressed like a cut-price
Kardashian. Pretending to be drunk again, but it’s scary this
time. She’s vibrating with anger- it’s coming off her in
waves. Finally, someone approaches her, she looks up- does
she recognize him? We stay on her face.
PAUL (V.O.)
You want a drink?
She looks up at him: gotcha.
Why not?

CASSANDRA

80

EXT. BLUE STAR BAR - LATER
PAUL, wearing a fedora, is walking CASSANDRA out, her head is
lolling. PAUL looks at his phone.
PAUL
Fucking surge prices.
He looks at CASSANDRA, barely upright.
PAUL (CONT'D)
It’s not that far, can you walk?
CASSANDRA
Um. I don’t know...
Good girl.

PAUL

They start to walk, PAUL’s practically holding her up. ThenCassie?

RYAN (O.S.)

CASSANDRA turns around. RYAN is on his way into the bar. He
looks at her, shocked. CASSANDRA immediately sobers up. Well.
She’s not completely sober this time.
CASSANDRA
What are you doing here?
RYAN
I’m meeting some friends.
(beat)
Since my diary opened up last
minute.
CASSANDRA
Let me explain.
RYAN
No need. Seriously.
PAUL looks between them: awkward!
PAUL
Sorry, dude, I didn’t know she was
taken. She’s all yours.
RYAN looks at PAUL, disgusted.
RYAN
All mine? Do you even know her name?

81

PAUL steps back nervously, racking his brains.

82

PAUL
Um...Claire...?
CASSANDRA tries to diffuse this.
CASSANDRA
Eh. Pretty close...
RYAN looks at her, shocked. Shakes his head.
RYAN
Ok. Have a good night.
CASSANDRA
Don’t go. I’m sorry. Wait.
RYAN
Could have just told me you weren’t
interested, Cassie.
RYAN leaves. PAUL is giggling.
PAUL
ICE COLD!!!! That was humiliating!
CASSIE turns on him.
CASSANDRA
Why don’t you just fuck off now ok?
Paul looks at her.
PAUL
Wait. Are you sober?
(realizing)
Oh my god. You’re the psycho who
went home with Jez.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
PAUL
Shit. Take your crazy elsewhere,
sweetheart. Not interested. You’re
not even that hot.
CASSANDRA is deadly calm.
CASSANDRA
You’re hardly dropping panties
yourself, Paul.
(MORE)

83

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
When was the last time you scored
with someone in daylight?

84

Beat.
Careful.

PAUL

She takes a step towards him.
CASSANDRA
No. You be careful. I’m not the only
one who does this, you know? And
some of the other girls...they
really are crazy.
He backs away a little, nervously.
PAUL
I don’t believe you.
CASSANDRA
There’s a woman in this city who
carries a pair of scissors.
(she glances down at his
crotch)
Personally, I think she’s taking it
a little far but...
PAUL
(scared)
You’re lying.
CASSIE shrugs.
CASSANDRA
Then try it out next time you go
out. See what happens.
PAUL looks at her, he’s a little upset.
PAUL
Why do you all have to ruin
everything??
He runs off. She watches him go. Her eyes gleaming in the
neon of the club lights.
INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
The following morning, and things are looking bleak in the
cold light of day. CASSIE looks down at her book. She’s
starting to look and feel a little scary.

85

A new name: JORDAN GREEN. She dials the number next to it.
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
Halder Mackenzie Green.
CASSANDRA
Hi. I’d like to book an appointment
with Jordan Green, please.
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
I’m sorry, ma’am. Mr Green is on
sabbatical.
CASSANDRA
Oh. For how long?
Beat.
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
Indefinitely.
The receptionist hangs up. Weird.
EXT. JORDAN’S HOUSE - DAY
CASSANDRA steps up to the front door of a nice, suburban
house. She doesn’t look so good, everything is starting to
take a toll. She rings the doorbell.
A good looking, middle-aged man opens the door. Unshaven, a
little red around the eyes. This is JORDAN.
JORDAN
Can I help you?
CASSANDRA
I really hope so.
JORDAN
I’m sorry. I’m no longer practicing
the law, if you’ve come forCASSANDRA
It’s not about that.
JORDAN senses something in her. Maybe even has a feeling of
what’s coming.
JORDAN
I’ve been waiting.
(beat)
Come in.

86

CASSANDRA looks a little unnerved, but she steps into the
house.
INT. JORDAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
JORDAN leads CASSIE into his modern, expensive living room,
which has seen better days. Curtains drawn, dead flowers,
overflowing ashtrays. He notices her glance at a stack of
dirty plates and coffee cups.
JORDAN
My wife left a while back.
CASSANDRA
And you don’t know how to work a
dishwasher?
JORDAN laughs. Fair point.
JORDAN
I guess not.
He lights a cigarette. His hands are shaking. He’s clearly
scared.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
(off the cigarette)
You mind?
CASSANDRA shakes her head. There’s a silence. He’s nervous.
CASSANDRA is still, calm. Malevolent.
CASSANDRA
Your office told me you’re on
sabbatical. It was very easy to get
your address. They just gave it to
me actually.
JORDAN
I told them to give it to anyone who
asked.
CASSANDRA
That doesn’t seem safe.
JORDAN
No use hiding from the piper. He has
to be paid.
CASSANDRA
I guess so.

87

So...

JORDAN

88

CASSANDRA
I came here to talk to you about
something that happened eight years
ago.
JORDAN braces himself.
Alright.

JORDAN

CASSANDRA
Do you remember a client of yours
named Alexander Monroe?
JORDAN
I do. Yes. Al’s father is an old
friend.
CASSANDRA
Of course he is. You probably won’t
remember why Al Monroe and his dad
employed your services back then.
And you almost certainly won’t
remember the girl who you threatened
and bullied until she dropped her
case.
JORDAN
I remember her.
CASSANDRA is shocked. He thinks for a while.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
Nina? Was that it? I’m sorry, I
don’t remember her full name. It was
Nina though, wasn’t it?
CASSANDRA tries to hold it together.

Yes.

CASSANDRA
(whisper)

JORDAN
I remember.
(beat)
Have you come here to hurt me?
CASSANDRA
Do you want me to hurt you?
JORDAN
I think so.

89

CASSANDRA doesn’t know what to do. She’s frozen.
FinallyJORDAN (CONT'D)
I had a...well...I think of it as an
epiphany. The doctors called it a
psychotic episode. It was at work.
So... I’m on ”sabbatical”.
(beat)
You know I got a bonus for every
settlement out of court. And a bonus
for every charge dropped. All of us
did.
Silence.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
We had a guy who combed through
their social media accounts for
compromising information. Contacted
friends and past sexual partners. It
is amazing how much easier the
internet has made digging up dirt.
In the old days we’d have to go
through girls’ trash. But now it’s
just one drunk photo at a party and
you wouldn’t believe how hostile
that makes a jury.
CASSANDRA can barely breathe. Jordan comes over to her,
kneels in front of her.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
You’ve got to help me. I can’t
sleep. I can’t sleep. I haven’t
slept in...
He clutches at her hands. She recoils.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
You are real, aren’t you? I haven’t
totally lost it?
I’m real.

CASSANDRA

He nods.
JORDAN
I’ll never forgive myself. I hope
you know that. I’ll never forgive
myself for any of it.

90

CASSANDRA looks down at him. A mixture of pity and scorn, but
also, somewhere, deep relief. This is it.
Then finally, quietlyCASSANDRA
I forgive you.
The relief and gratitude from JORDAN is palpable. He puts his
head on her knees. In the stark, white room it is the image
of forgiveness. The Pietà.
Thank you.

JORDAN

Beat.
CASSANDRA
Go to sleep.
EXT. JORDAN’S HOUSE - DAY
CASSANDRA walks to her car. We reveal a timid, middle-aged
man, SIMON, leaning against her car. He sees her.
MAN
Do I go in now?
Beat.
No.

CASSANDRA

She opens her car door.
MAN
Oh. I’m still getting paid though,
right?
Yeah.

CASSANDRA

She gets into her car. He gets into the passenger seat.
EXT. NINA’S HOUSE - DAY
CASSANDRA is standing across the street from Nina’s house.
It’s similar to her own, just another anonymous suburban
street. She’s trying not to cry.

91

Her phone rings. It’s MADISON. She cancels guiltily. This
whole thing is starting to feel horrible. Pointless.
When she looks up, MRS. FISHER, Nina’s mother, is on the
porch, peering over at her.
Cassie?

MRS FISHER

EXT. NINA’S HOUSE - DAY
CASSIE and MRS FISHER sit on the steps of the house. CASSIE
is sipping from a juice box MRS FISHER has given her.
MRS FISHER
I’d ask you in but...you know it
upsets George to see you.
CASSANDRA
I know. I’m sorry.
(beat)
You remember Nina’s sixteenth
birthday party?
MRS FISHER chuckles.
MRS FISHER
Yeah. That was a mess.
CASSANDRA
Nina threw up on the swing.
MRS FISHER
Not her finest.
CASSANDRA
And that boy stole your vase and
Nina made him bring it back the next
day and apologize to you.
MRS FISHER
He was so scared of her. She was
practically holding onto his ear.
“SAY YOU’RE SORRY TO MY MOM,
ASSHOLE”.
Cassie laughs.
CASSANDRA
What was his name? Was it...Simon
something...or Steve-

92

MRS FISHER tries to be kind, but she is tired.
MRS FISHER
Why are you here?
CASSANDRA
I just wanted to see you.
MRS FISHER
You need to stop this.
CASSANDRA is a little shocked.
MRS FISHER (CONT'D)
It isn’t good for any of us. It’s no
good for Nina, it isn’t good for
you.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
I’m just trying to... fix it...
MRS FISHER
(savage)
You can’t. Don’t be a child, Cassie.
You know what it’s like for us?
Having to bear this? And you, still
standing outside our house like a
ghost. Still wearing that stupid
necklace you girls gave each other
in middle school. Yanking us back
into it every time we see you.
MRS FISHER is distress, fighting back tears.
CASSANDRA
I’m so sorry. I didn’t think.
MRS FISHER
No. Well. I’m sorry too. Move on,
Cassie. For all of us.
MRS FISHER leaves. CASSIE sits on step. She knows she’s
right: this is over.
INT. RYAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - EVENING
CASSANDRA waits nervously in the hallway of RYAN’s apartment.
He answers the door. Not pleased to see her.
RYAN
Oh great. You.

93

CASSANDRA
Can I come in?
The desperation on her face makes him relent.
INT. RYAN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
RYAN leads her into his apartment. It’s cozy, but clean,
books everywhere.
CASSIE hovers nervously, unsure where to stand.
RYAN
You want anything? Coffee? Another
guy to go home with?
CASSANDRA can’t help but laugh.
CASSANDRA
Yeah actually do you have any
douchebags lying around?
RYAN
There’s a racist neighbor on the
third floor.
Perfect!

CASSANDRA

The smile awkwardly.
RYAN
What do you want, Cassie?
CASSANDRA
I came to apologize. About... I’ve
been trying to think about how to
explain.
RYAN
How’s that going for you?
She laughs.
CASSANDRA
Not great. Yeah.
RYAN
It’s fine, really.
CASSANDRA
It’s not that I’m not interested. I
really am. I really, really am.

94

RYAN
Ok. I mean, forgive me if I’m
confused but, you won’t kiss me,
you’ll barely touch me, but I find
you going home with some random
creep in a fedora.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
I admit....the fedora was
unforgivable.
RYAN can’t help but smile. He sighs.
RYAN
Why are you here?
CASSANDRA
The other night... it won’t happen
again. I promise. It’ll never happen
again. It’s hard to explain.
(beat)
Can we try again? Can I try, I mean.
RYAN looks at her, thinks.
RYAN
I don’t know.
(beat)
Are you ok?
She shrugs: I don’t know.
RYAN nods. Silence. FinallyCASSANDRA
I guess I’ll see you around then.
She leaves. She’s blown it.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
CASSANDRA stares at AL MONROE’S BACHELOR PARTY PAGE. She
spots RYAN on his time line. “Sorry I can’t make it, bro!
Have a great time.”
She looks at AL’s stupid face, all his douchey friends. She
closes her computer.
She consults her book. One name left: AL MONROE. She tears
out the page, screws it up and throws it away. Enough.

INT. MAKE ME COFFEE SHOP - EVENING
CASSANDRA is alone. The bell rings, she doesn’t look up.
CASSANDRA
We’re closed for the night.
Good.

RYAN (O.S.)

CASSANDRA looks up. RYAN is standing in front of her.
Hi.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
You wanna go to dinner you miserable
asshole?
CASSANDRA smiles.
Yeah.

CASSANDRA

He kisses her. It’s wonderful.
INT. PHARMACY - DAY
That weekend. CASSIE and RYAN are choosing snacks at the
pharmacy when Paris Hilton’s “Stars Are Blind” comes on the
speaker.
RYAN starts to nod his head slightly to the music, CASSIE
notices: Paris Hilton, huh? Then suddenly RYAN bursts into a
vamping lip synch, using the snacks as props. CASSIE ties not
to be impressed but it’s hard, she’s giggling, people are
looking. Then finally, she joins in.

INT. PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER
“Stars are Blind” is winding down. CASSIE and RYAN go to pay
for their stuff.
RYAN
God, I love that song.
CASSANDRA
Of course. It’s a masterpiece.
INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
SUSAN brings a big bowl of salad from the kitchen and sets it
down on the dining room table. Where CASSANDRA, RYAN and
STANLEY are waiting somewhat nervously, bowls full of
spaghetti in front of them. It’s a little awkward.
SUSAN
Eat! Eat! It’ll get cold.
RYAN
This looks delicious. Thank you!
STANLEY
I made the sauce!
Cassie winces. She forgotten what it’s like to introduce
people to your parents.
STANLEY (CONT'D)
Wow. That is...really great sauce.
Stanley beams.
SUSAN
So you’re a doctor, Ryan? You’re
parents must be very proud!

98

RYAN
Oh no. They wanted me to be a DJ.
Beat. Then STANLEY and SUSAN laugh. Tension broken. The
relief.
STANLEY
He’s funny! You didn’t say he was
funny, Cassie.
Daaaaad.

CASSANDRA

RYAN
You didn’t?
CASSANDRA
No. I said you were boring but rich.

99

RYAN
You know, I’m not even that rich.
STANLEY
Well. Nice knowing you, son.
They all laugh. STANLEY and SUSAN catch each other’s eye, and
smile.
INT. CASSANDRA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
SUSAN and STANLEY are doing the dishes. We hear the front
door close, and CASSANDRA reappears.
CASSANDRA
He says he wants the sauce recipe,
Dad.
STANLEY beams.
Kiss ass.

STANLEY

SUSAN
What a lovely evening.
STANLEY
He seems very nice, Cassie. Very
nice.
CASSANDRA
Eh. He’s ok.
SUSAN
You’re allowed to like someone,
honey.
I know.

CASSANDRA

She kisses CASSIE goodnight, squeezes her.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Alright, alright. Move it along.
SUSAN stops the hug.
SUSAN
Night night.
She leaves for bed. STANLEY lingers for a second.

100

STANLEY
Thank you for introducing us to
Ryan. I know it must have been hard.
Your mom is so... we are both so
glad.

101

Suddenly STANLEY is on the verge of tears. CASSANDRA is
embarrassed, she doesn’t know what to do.
CASSANDRA
Oh my god. Dad! He’s not that nice!
He laughs, and pulls himself together hastily.
STANLEY
Sorry. I must be tired.
He goes to leave. ThenSTANLEY (CONT'D)
We miss her, Cassie. But god, we’ve
missed you too.
He leaves her in the kitchen, taking this in. What these
years must have been like for her parents.
INT. RYAN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
CASSIE and RYAN are in bed.
RYAN
Your mom’s pretty hot.
CASSANDRA
You want her number? I could hook
you up?
RYAN
(hopeful)
Really?
CASSANDRA
Yeah. I think she likes you more
than I do.
He laughs.
RYAN
I hope that’s not true.
Beat.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Can I tell you something?
Sure.

CASSANDRA

RYAN sits up on his elbow and looks at her. He’s nervous.

102

RYAN
I think you’re amazingShe realizes what’s happening.
CASSANDRA
Oh no, Ryan-don’t. Please. No.
RYAN
Let me finish, you stupid bitch. I
think you’re amazing. And think,
yup, I’m pretty sure I’m falling in
love with you.
CASSANDRA is silent.
CASSANDRA
Get out. Get out. Now.
RYAN looks horrified.
What?

RYAN

CASSANDRA smiles.
CASSANDRA
I’m kidding.
(beat)
I think I love you too.
RYAN is about to celebrateCASSANDRA (CONT'D)
DON’T make a thing of it. Just be
cool.
RYAN calms down.
RYAN
Okay. I’m cool. I’m cool.
He’s not though. He kisses her. And she kisses back.
EXT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY
CASSANDRA, in an incredibly good mood, is walking to her
house with groceries, when a woman gets out of her car and
walks across the street to her. It is MADISON MCPHEE.
CASSIE had completely forgotten.

103

CASSANDRA
(under her breath)
Shit.
Hey!

MADISON

CASSANDRA
Madison! What are you doing here?
MADISON looks terrible, she hasn’t slept for weeks.
MADISON
I’m sorry, I just...I tried calling.
I left messages. I don’t know if
your number worked. Maybe I had an
old one.
MADISON is on the verge of tears.
MADISON (CONT'D)
I know this is crazy waiting for you
in my car like some kind of stalker
or something...
CASSANDRA
No, Madison, I’m sorry. I’m so
sorry. I should have called you
back. Nothing happened with that
guy.
MADISON
Are you sure...it seemed like...
CASSANDRA
I know what it seemed like. But it
wasn’t. He didn’t touch you.
MADISON is almost sick with relief.
MADISON
Oh thank god. I’ve been...so worried
that I...that we...
CASSANDRA
He just put you in bed, that’s all.
Made sure you were in the recovery
position. Nothing happened, Madison.
I promise.
MADISON believes her. The relief. She wipes away a tear.
Takes a deep breath.

104

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I’m really sorry I didn’t call
sooner. I didn’t mean to scare you
this much.
MADISON
Yeah. Well.
(beat)
Look there’s... I need to show you
something.
Ok...

CASSANDRA

MADISON
Can we go inside?
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
MADISON follows CASSIE into the living room nervously. She’s
dreading this.
CASSANDRA
You need some water or something?
MADISON
No. Thank you.
This is a struggle.
MADISON (CONT'D)
After...after we had lunch and
I...got so drunk. And I woke up in a
hotel room with that guy... I
thought about it, about what you
said about Nina. About how we
all...you know. Just. Acted like...
And I remembered something.
What?

CASSANDRA

MADISON can’t say it.
What?

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)

MADISON
There was a tape.
CASSANDRA might have been hit by a truck.

105

What?

CASSANDRA

MADISON
A stupid video. It got sent round. I
got sent it. We all did. It was
just...at the time it was just,
gossip, you know?
Gossip.

CASSANDRA

MADISON
So much...stuff happened back then,
like, all the time. You know what it
was like just...one blackout after
another. I hoped maybe I imagined
it. But.
She gets out an old blackberry. She’s shaking.
MADISON (CONT'D)
I kept all my old phones for photos
and whatever. So...here.
(she passes it)
I don’t know how we could ever have
watched it and...
What?

CASSANDRA

MADISON
Thought it was funny.
MADISON is numb with shame.
MADISON (CONT'D)
Look. You can have the phone, ok?
You don’t have to watch it...I
really wouldn’t watch it but...I
don’t know. Do whatever you want
with it. Just leave me out of it.
MADISON gets up to leave.
MADISON (CONT'D)
And please, will you do me a favor?
Yeah.

CASSANDRA

MADISON
Never fucking contact me again.

106

MADISON leaves. CASSIE is numb, everything falling down
around her.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
CASSANDRA looks at the blackberry in her hands. She has to
watch it. She knows she has to.
She starts to play the video. We can hear it but not see it:
we stay on her face. It is terrible, horrifying.
CASSANDRA
(whispers)
Oh, Nina.
We hear a group of guys are cheering AL on.
JOE (O.S.)
Holy shit!! Look at this.
(beat)
Ryan! Ryan!
And then, CASSIE’s expression changes. We hear RYAN’s voice,
slurred with drink.
RYAN (O.S.)
Don’t film me, man! Come on. Stop
filming this!
He laughs. On CASSIE: complete, earth-shattering shock.
INT. BATHORY HOSPITAL - LATER
A small smear of blood on an industrial floor.
We reveal CASSIE, in the waiting room, staring down at it.
She’s waiting for RYAN. He appears.
RYAN
Cassie, are you ok? What’s happened?
CASSANDRA
Can we go somewhere to talk,
privately?
RYAN
I’m working.

107

CASSANDRA
(calmly)
We need to talk. Right now.
RYAN can see that she’s not kidding.
INT. BATHORY HOSPITAL - RYAN’S OFFICE - LATER
RYAN takes CASSANDRA into his office.
RYAN
What’s going on?
CASSANDRA looks at him, heartbroken.
CASSANDRA
I’ve been such an asshole.
RYAN
What do you mean?
CASSANDRA
I really thought for a second it was
all going to be ok.
Cassie-

RYAN

CASSANDRA
Look at this.
She passes over MADISON’s phone. RYAN watches.
RYAN
What are you showing me? Is
that...Al Monroe? Is that his
dorm...what...
Suddenly he remembers. He passes the phone back, upset.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I don’t want to watch this.
CASSANDRA
You were happy to watch back then.
RYAN
I don’t know what you’re talking
about, I wasn’tThen he hears his own voice on the video. It’s undeniable.

108

RYAN is horrified.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I don’t...I don’t remember...
He watches for a second, the sadness as it comes back to him.
CASSANDRA
Didn’t make an impact, huh?
RYAN doesn’t know what to say.
RYAN
We were kids...
But her look silences him.
CASSANDRA
I need you to do something for me.
And I want you to think about it
very carefully. I have this video,
ready to send to everyone in your
address book. Your parents. Your
colleagues. All your old college
buddies and their wives.
RYAN
Cassie, please. Come on.
CASSANDRA
So, I can send it out right now. Or
you can tell me where Al Monroe’s
bachelor party is.
RYAN is stunned.
Why?

RYAN

Beat.
CASSANDRA
You don’t need to know why.
RYAN
What are you going to do?
CASSANDRA
It depends.
On what?

RYAN

109

Beat.
CASSANDRA
Do you think they’ll fire you here?
You work with kids so... they have
to be careful. Things have changed
so much since we were at school,
haven’t they?
RYAN
Think about this. Please. Please.
Please.
CASSANDRA
I cannot begin to tell you how much
I’ve thought about it.
She stares him down. Finally, he writes down the address on a
piece of paper, hands it over.
RYAN
There. They’re all going up there
this weekend.
CASSANDRA folds up the paper and puts it in her pocket.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(tearful)
You don’t...you don’t think I’m a
bad person now, do you? I love you,
Cassie. You’ll forgive me won’t you?
Tell me you’ll forgive me.
No.

CASSANDRA

Beat. Then a new horror dawns on RYAN.
RYAN
Are you going to tell everyone?
CASSANDRA
I don’t know.
RYAN
I just don’t...I don’t know if I can
live with the threat of this hanging
over me.
CASSIE laughs.
Right.

CASSANDRA

110

She goes to leave then-

111

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
And don’t think about telling any of
them that I’m coming. I’ll send the
video around just the same if you
do.
CASSANDRA smiles.
Bye, Ryan!

CASSANDRA (CONT'D)

She leaves him alone, reeling from what just happened.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
CASSANDRA puts her head around the door. SUSAN is gluing
shells onto a box.
CASSANDRA
Hey, Mom. I’m going away for the
weekend, ok?
SUSAN
Oh! With Ryan?
CASSANDRA
No actually. There’s this...coffee
symposium thing...it’s lame...but
Gail thought it might be good for
work.
SUSAN
Alright. Do you need me to pack you
something for the trip?
CASSANDRA
I’m not going to summer camp, Mom.
SUSAN bristles a little.
I know!

SUSAN

CASSANDRA softens.
CASSANDRA
Thanks though.
(beat)
I love you.
SUSAN is a little taken aback. She’s about to respond, but
CASSIE is gone.

112

I/E. CAR - DIRT ROAD - EVENING
CASSANDRA is pulled up on an old road in the middle of
nowhere. No cars in sight. No houses. Just the woods. She’s
doing her make up in the mirror- it’s super heightened. Big
red lips, big eyes. She’s barely recognizable.

113

She grabs a powder blue wig from the passenger seat, her old
book is underneath it, the torn out page stuffed back into
it. She puts on the wig.
She gets out of the car. She’s wearing a PVC nurse’s uniform,
she takes off her plates and tosses them into the bushes.
Then goes into the trunk to grab a matching nurse’s bag and a
huge bottle of vodka. She slams the trunk shut, and starts
the journey down the deserted road.
EXT. CABIN HOUSE - EVENING
We follow CASSANDRA as she walks up to a isolated house in
the middle of the woods. Her high heels are in her hands.
EXT. CABIN HOUSE - EVENING/NIGHT
CASSANDRA finishes putting on her shoes on and rings the
bell. A super hammered guy, JOE, answers.
JOE
YESSSSSSSSSSS! THE DOCTOR IS IN THE
HOUSE!!!!
We hear cheering from inside. A wall of choking testosterone.
INT. CABIN HOUSE - LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
JOE leads CASSANDRA into the run-down lounge. It looks like a
fart-filled frat house basement. It is full of drunk dudes
playing poker, beer pong and listening to terrible EDM.
Among them is AL MONROE, preppy and very embarrassed.
CASSANDRA is momentarily floored seeing him again. She covers
it.
JOE
This is what I’m talking about, man!
It’s stripper time, baby!!
CHIP
Nurse, I’m feeling sick, can you
take my temperature?
AL MONROE
I thought I said no strippers, you
guys! Anastasia will lose her shit.
His friends all boo him.

114

AL MONROE (CONT'D)
Who ordered her?

115

The dudes all look innocent.
JOE
Don’t look at me, man!
Not me!

CHIP

AL MONROE
No one owning up, huh? Well when
Anastasia finds out it’s your
funeral.
CASSANDRA
I take it you’re the groom?
Yeah.

AL MONROE

CASSANDRA
Then sit the fuck down.
She grabs a chair and slams AL down on it roughly. The boys
all “oooooooooooh!”
Hey!

AL MONROE

JOE
Uh oh! You’re in trouble, bro.
JOE giggles. The guys are giddy with excitement. CASSANDRA
gets out the vodka.
CASSANDRA
Now I’m going to need you all to
kneel in front of me like the
naughty boys you are. Is everybody
here? Don’t want anyone to miss out.
The guys kneel down eagerly, giggling.
JOE
We’re all present, nurse!
CASSANDRA
Good. Then I think it’s time for
your medicine.
CASSANDRA pours vodka down into their open mouths one by one.
AL MONROE
Don’t I get any?

116

CASSANDRA
No. You get something way better.

117

She turns on the music. “SPRORGNSM” by Superorganism.
Glitchy, swoony, and somewhat weird. She beings to unzip her
nurse’s dress.
But we cut away, and travel along the cheering and jeering
bros. Super-slo mo. Super detailed. We can see the bloodshot
eyes and the sweat. And the hard-ons underneath the chinos.
It’s frightening, animal: violence and desire are in the air.
Brief flashes of CASSIE, her hair, her lips, small details,
but never what the audience wants to see: the hot girl taking
her clothes off.
Finally, we speed back up to normal as CASSIE straddles AL.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Time to go upstairs.
AL MONROE
I don’t think...
CASSANDRA
(whisper)
Look, I won’t do anything if you
don’t want to, but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.
OK.

AL MONROE

CASSANDRA zips her dress back up, takes him by the hand and
triumphantly leads him up the stairs, the guys go crazy.
JOE
I wanna see her crawling out of here
in the morning, Al!! She’d better
not be able to walk!!
CHIP
Leave some for us, man!!!
INT. CABIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
A peeling bedroom. Plaid, old mouldering boar heads, and a
needlepoint sign which reads “Yeeeh Haw!” above the bed. We
can hear the music thumping from downstairs.
AL MONROE
So. What do I...
CASSANDRA
Get on the bed.

118

Ok.

AL MONROE

(jokey)
I’m a little scared of you.
CASSANDRA
You don’t need to be scared. Get on
the bed.
AL does. She gets some pink, fluffy handcuffs out of her
nurse’s bag.
AL MONROE
Wait. Sorry. I’m not sure about
this.
CASSANDRA
It’s for my safety.
AL MONROE
What do you mean?
CASSANDRA
When I give private dances...guys
can get a little handsy so...
AL MONROE
Oh. Right. Of course.
He lets her put on the handcuffs.
AL MONROE (CONT'D)
You know...you don’t have to...I’m a
gentleman.
Are you?
Yeah.

CASSANDRA
AL MONROE

CASSANDRA
You might be surprised to hear that
gentlemen are sometimes the worst.
She finishes cuffing him.
AL MONROE
Ow. Can you loosen them a little?
CASSANDRA
You’ll get used to it.

119

AL MONROE
Look. I don’t want to sound like a
pussy but...you’re not going to...do
anything, are you? It’s just, I love
my fiancee. We’re getting married
so...I don’t want any...um...
CASSANDRA
(kind)
Hey. Do I look like someone who
would make you do something you
don’t want to do?
No.
Exactly.

AL MONROE
CASSANDRA

AL MONROE
What’s your name?
Candy.

CASSANDRA

AL MONROE
I mean. Your real name.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
Nina. Nina Fisher.
AL looks like a ghost just walked into the room. She’s
standing at the foot of his bed, staring coldly down at him.
AL MONROE
What did you say?
CASSANDRA
I said my name is Nina Fisher.
AL starts to struggle against the cuffs.
AL MONROE
Can you let me out of these, please?
CASSANDRA
I’m sorry I can’t.

120

AL MONROE
Did one of the guys put you up to
this? Was it Joe? Jesus Christ this
is dark, even for him.
CASSANDRA
I don’t follow.
AL MONROE
You are not Nina Fisher.
Why not?

CASSANDRA

AL MONROE
Because...she’s dead.
Beat.
CASSANDRA
Must be another Nina Fisher. A
coincidence.
AL MONROE
I don’t think so. Please let me go.
This isn’t funny.
CASSANDRA
Why would I give you a dead girl’s
name?
AL MONROE is panicking.
AL MONROE
This is fucked up, ok? Stop it.
CASSANDRA
But, I’m not doing anything.
AL MONROE
(shouting)
GUYS! JOE! BRANDON! CHIP! GUYS! CAN
YOU GET UP HERE!
The music is throbbing.
CASSANDRA
I don’t think they can hear you. And
even if you could shout out loud...
What?

AL MONROE

121

CASSANDRA
They’re all passed out by now.
AL MONROE is really scared now.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
Because if there is one thing that I
learned at Forrest College, it is
how easy it is to slip something
into a drink. You’d think they’d
remember that. Especially Joe!
AL MONROE
Do I know you?
CASSANDRA
I’m not sure you’d remember me, Al.
You were so popular.
It dawns on him.
AL MONROE
You’re Nina’s friend. Oh fuck.
You’re Nina’s friend.
CASSANDRA
So you DID notice me after all. I’m
surprised. I wasn’t super-fuckable
at college so, I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.
AL MONROE
What do you want? Money? Are you
blackmailing me? You can have
anything.
CASSANDRA
No, I don’t need money. I just want
a conversation.
AL MONROE
Anything you want, ok?
CASSANDRA
I want you to tell me what you did.
AL MONROE
Are you talking about...?
CASSANDRA
What do you think I’m talking about?
AL MONROE
I didn’t do anything! We were kids!

122

CASSANDRA
If I hear that ONE MORE TIME.
CASSANDRA is really, really angry. It’s all coming apart now.

123

AL MONROE
Look maybe she regretted it after
butCASSANDRA
Oh yeah she regretted it.
AL MONROE
I didn’t do anything!
WRONG!

CASSANDRA

AL MONROE
What do you think the fucking story
is?
CASSANDRA
Different to you I imagine.
AL MONROE
I don’t know what you want me to
say. We did not...
She let’s him flounder.
What?

CASSANDRA

AL MONROE
You know...
(whisper)
Rape her.
CASSANDRA
No? She could barely hold her head
up, she had no idea what was going
on.
AL MONROE
It was a party! I mean...yeah we
were all drunk, of course. But...she
was into it!
CASSANDRA
Didn’t look like she was into it on
the video.
Beat.
AL MONROE
What video?

124

CASSANDRA
Oh you don’t remember? Your friend
Joe taped it. Let me tell you, that
party does not look so good in the
cold light of day.
Joe remembers with terrible clarity. He’s starting to panic,
to get tearful.
AL MONROE
I’ll give you anything. I’ll do
anything. Anything.
CASSANDRA
Aw don’t cry.
(harsh)
Really. Don’t fucking cry. Tell me
what you did.
AL MONROE
I didn’t do anything wrong though!!
CASSANDRA
She dropped out. Top of her class,
and she dropped out. I did too to
take care of her. The two of us,
gone. You graduated Magna Cum Laude
though. Did you ever feel guilty? Or
did you just feel relieved that
she’d gone?

125

AL MONROE
I was affected too, you know? It’s
every guy’s worst nightmare, getting
accused like that.
CASSANDRA
Can you guess what every girl’s
worst nightmare is?
AL’s lip wobbles.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
The thing is, you thought you’d
gotten away with it because everyone
had forgotten. But I haven’t.
She opens her PVC nurse’s bag. In it are all of her surgical
instruments from college. He’s really panicking now.
AL MONROE
You’re out of your fucking mind!
CASSANDRA
I was so sad to leave, you know. I’d
wanted to be a doctor my whole life.
(beat)
But lately, I’ve been feeling like I
might want to get back into it.
She picks up a scalpel.
AL MONROE
Stop! Please!
She sits on the bed.
CASSANDRA
You know. Nina was extraordinary. So
smart. Weirdly smart.
He struggles.
AL MONROE
Help! Help me! Fuck!

126

CASSANDRA
Shhh. I want you to know what she
was like, ok? But she’s so difficult
to explain because she was just so
completely herself. Even when she
was four years old. She was fully
formed from day one. Same face. Same
walk. And funny like a grown up was
funny. Kind of, shrewd. Perceptive.
So smart.
CASSIE is absent-mindedly holding onto her BFF half-heart
necklace, with “Nina” written on it.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I was just in awe of her. I couldn’t
believe she wanted to be my friend!
She didn’t give a fuck what anyone
else thought, except for me. Because
she was just...Nina.
(beat)
And then she wasn’t. Suddenly, she
was something else, she was yours.
It wasn’t her name she heard when
she was walking around, it was
yours. Your name all over her. All
around her. All the time. And it
just...squeezed her out.
(beat)
So when I heard your name again.
Your filthy fucking name. I wondered
when was the last time someone had
said hers. Or thought it even. Apart
from me.
(beat)
And it made me so sad. Because, Al,
you should be the one with her name
all over you.
No.

AL MONROE

CASSANDRA
Don’t worry. I’ve sterilized
everything. I really would have been
a great doctor.
AL MONROE
You’re insane.
CASSANDRA
You know what? I honestly don’t
think I am.

127

CASSANDRA unbuttons his shirt slowly.
CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
I’ll do this as quick as I can, ok?
She’s about to cut him, whenBAM!- He breaks a hand free from a handcuff and grabs her by
the throat. CASSANDRA is caught off-guard.
He turns her onto the bed, to get both hands around her
throat. She struggles. He’s choking her.
AL MONROE
You asked for this. You fucking
asked for this. This is
your...fault.
CASSANDRA is looking at him. She can’t breathe.
She somehow slips out of his grasp. There’s a struggle, with
AL’s hand tied to the bed they’re evenly matched, she manages
to get her hand free again and she raises the scalpel.
It looks like she might win when, at the last second, AL
catches her arm and twists it. The scalpel falls to the
ground.
He wrestles her back down onto the bed. One arm on her neck,
pushing down. He starts to cry.
AL MONROE (CONT'D)
This is your fault...
He can’t look at her. He grabs a pillow puts it over her
face.
He climbs onto her head, kneeling on the pillow, smothering
her with his knees. The one hand still handcuffed to the bed.
It’s clumsy. It is going on for much too long. It feels like
forever as she struggles underneath him. Every second we’re
waiting for her to turn things around.
She tries to fight back, her hands scrabbling over him. She
scratches his neck, but she’s running out of air. Her face
hidden. AL is really sobbing now, kneeling on top of her.
Finally, after a long time, her body goes limp. Her arm
falls, lifeless, to the ground.
AL stays on top of her. Crying.
He climbs off tentatively.

128

We wait for the Fatal Attraction moment when she springs back
to life. It never comes.
INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - MORNING
We are in the exact same place at the night before. A shaft
of light on the bed from above. AL is still on the bed, one
hand still handcuffed to a post. He’s been up all night,
unable to get out of it: his wrist is bleeding. A scratch
mark has come up on his neck.
CASSANDRA’s face is still under the pillow, her body in the
same position. AL is shivering, crying. We hear footsteps in
the hallway.
A bluebottle bats against the window.
We are on CASSIE’S hand, her perfect manicure, hanging off
the bed, the scalpel a few inches away on the floor. When JOE
barges in.
JOE
Oh man, what a night!!
He stops. Takes in the “sleeping” body and the handcuffs.
Starts giggling.
JOE (CONT'D)
Oh my god!! Is that the fucking
nurse? Are you kidding me? Nooooice!
Joe-

AL MONROE

JOE
Don’t freak out! Come on. Anastasia
will never know. Okay? What happens
on tour, stays on tour.
Beat.
AL MONROE
She’s dead, Joe.
JOE looks at him, then laughs.
Come on.

JOE

AL MONROE
I’m not kidding.
Beat.

129

JOE
Ohhh. Fuuuck. You’re being ironic.

130

AL MONROE
(desperate)
What?
JOE
Killing a stripper at your bachelor
party? What is this the 90s?
Classic.
(beat)
You want me to get her outta here so
you can sleep? Her money’s
downstairs, although I’m not sure we
gave her a big enough tip now I see
what’s been going on here!
He walks over, and shakes her shoulder.
JOE (CONT'D)
Time to go, babe.
No response. JOE pulls the pillow up. AL looks away,
squeamish. CASSANDRA’s face is still hidden. It takes JOE a
few seconds. He replaces the pillow.
SHIT!

JOE (CONT'D)

AL MONROE
I told you!
JOE
SHIT! Oh my god. Oh my god. The
fucking stripper is dead! YOU KILLED
THE STRIPPER! How did this happen?
AL starts to cry again. Blubbering like a child.
AL MONROE
I don’t know!
JOE goes around to comfort him. This is the beginning of
every bro comedy where a guy accidentally kills/hits/hurts a
sex worker. We’ve seen this trope before. Guys hurting women.
Guys covering for their friends. We are familiar with this
scene.
JOE
Hey man. This is not your fault ok?
AL MONROE
(sniffing)
I don’t know...it kinda seems like
it is...

131

JOE
No, it’s not!
AL MONROE
(crying)
Am I...am I going to jail? What
about the wedding? What about my
job? Anastasia is going to be so
upset. No one will understand...
JOE
It was an accident though, right?
I mean-

AL MONROE

JOE
(firm)
It was an accident, Al.
AL MONROE
Yeah. Of course. I mean, of course
it was!
JOE thinks.
JOE
Listen to me. No one is going to
jail ok? Because no one is going to
know about this. If anyone asks, we
all saw her leave last night. She
stripped and she left.
AL MONROE
(faint)
She left...
JOE
Exactly. We’ll take care of it. We
just need to hide the body til the
others go.
AL nods gratefully.
JOE (CONT'D)
Al, hey, look at me.
AL looks at JOE.
JOE (CONT'D)
This is not your fault.

132

AL MONROE
(whisper)
Thank you.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
“Something Wonderful” from The King And I plays over the next
few scenes.
A thick plume of black smoke rises above the trees.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
Everyone else has gone home. In the twilight of the woods,
JOE holds onto a crying AL.
They are standing in front of a bonfire. JOE throws on the
blue wig. AL can’t look. He’s too sad. JOE comforts him. JOE
nudges CASSANDRA’s hand back onto the fire with his foot.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
The fire is dying out. JOE throws CASSANDRA’s car keys into
the embers. He gently leads AL away. Poor AL is feeling very
sorry for himself.
BLACK.
INT. CASSANDRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Two cops, LINCOLN, a kindly, seasoned detective and TODD, his
smart, young partner, are interviewing a terrified SUSAN and
STANLEY.
SUSAN
Can’t you track her phone or
something?
LINCOLN
I’m sorry, ma’am. It was turned off
before she left. Seems like she
really didn’t want anyone to know
where she was.
SUSAN
It’s not like her to
just...disappear like this.

133

STANLEY
Well, honey, that’s not entirelySUSAN
(stern)
Stanley.
SUSAN starts to cry.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
She was getting better. She was
getting better, wasn’t she?
STANLEY comforts her.
STANLEY
Of course she was. She’ll come back.
You know what she’s like. She always
comes back.
The cops look at STANLEY. They can see from his face he
doesn’t believe this.
TODD
Was she seeing anyone? Did she have
a boyfriend?
INT. BATHORY HOSPITAL - RYAN’S OFFICE - DAY
RYAN is working when he hears a knock on the door. It’s
LINCOLN.
LINCOLN
Are you Dr. Cooper?
Yeah.

RYAN

LINCOLN flashes his badge.
LINCOLN
Detective Walker.
RYAN tries to stay calm. Has CASSIE sent the video?
RYAN
Sure, come in.
We can feel that LINCOLN is impressed by Ryan.
LINCOLN
Pediatric surgeon, huh?

134

Yeah.

RYAN

LINCOLN
That’s very commendable. Thank you
for all that you do for the
community.
RYAN is a little wrong-footed.
Sure.

RYAN

LINCOLN
Sorry to bother you at work, doctor.
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?
Beat.
RYAN
(wary)
Yeah. Yes. Why?
LINCOLN
How do you know her?

135

RYAN
We were seeing each other.
LINCOLN
‘Were’ seeing each other?
RYAN
Yeah. We...we broke up a few days
ago.
LINCOLN
Define a few days.
RYAN
Um. Last Thursday.
LINCOLN
Have you had any contact since?
RYAN
No. I’m sorry, what is this
regarding?
LINCOLN
Cassandra’s parents have filed a
missing persons report.
This is a surprise.
What? Why?

RYAN

Beat.
LINCOLN
Because she’s missing.
RYAN is reeling. This doesn’t make sense.
RYAN
Since when?
LINCOLN
Since Friday.
RYAN
Jesus. Why didn’t anyone tell me?
LINCOLN
You said you were no longer her
boyfriend.

136

RYAN
I’m not but...
LINCOLN
She told her parents something about
a work trip, but her colleague
didn’t know anything about it. Do
you have any idea where she might
have been going to this weekend?
I-

RYAN

He stops. If he’s honest he could be hugely compromised. They
could find the video.
What he’s about to say is terrible.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Yeah she...said she was going on a
work trip.
LINCOLN
Any idea where?
Beat.
RYAN
No. I’m sorry.
LINCOLN
It’s alright, doc. Between you and
me, it sounded like she wasn’t
feeling so good. Mentally, I mean.
Her father seemed to think she
was... a little unstable.
Beat.
RYAN
Yeah. She was...not in a good place.
LINCOLN
You think she might have...
LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Wanted to hurt herself?
This is the get out RYAN needs. He’s happy to believe it too.
It’ll absolve him. He can be the good guy again.

137

RYAN
(relief)
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. She could have.
LINCOLN
I thought that might be the case.
Thank you for your honesty.
(beat)
Well. I don’t want to bother you
anymore, but if you wouldn’t mind
coming to the station tomorrow, you
know, for an official statement.
RYAN
(earnest)
Of course. Anything I can do to
help.
TODD
Thank you for your time, doctor.
Appreciate it.
LINCOLN leaves. RYAN watches him go. He’s gotten away with
it, but it doesn’t feel good.
EXT. LAWN - DAY
A beautiful day. A beautiful “artisan” woodland wedding. AL
gazes at his beautiful wife. We can just see a band aid on
his neck above his collar.
He and ANASTASIA exchange vows to a ukulele version of
“You’re Still The One” by Shania Twain. As AL takes the ring
from his best man, JOE, JOE winks at him. AL tries not to
flinch.
We weave in and out as AL kisses his bride. As they run down
the aisle to cheering. Have their photos taken. As the
gorgeous guests mill around drinking champagne and laughing.
Among it, but apart from it, is RYAN. Trying to look like
he’s enjoying himself. JOE approaches him.
JOE
Do you see that bridesmaid?
He nods over.
JOE (CONT'D)
She trained with the Circe Du
Soleil. You can come on her face and
her back at the same time.

138

RYAN
That’s nice.
JOE grins and runs over to the bridesmaid. RYAN sighs. ThenHis phone goes. It’s a message, he looks at the screen.
CASSIE.
Holy shit. He looks around, furtively reads the text.
“Scheduled Message from CASSANDRA THOMAS pending”.
What?
“No Regrets” by The Walker Brothers begins to play.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE:
INT. JORDAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

MONTAGE: Jordan opens a package. Inside is MADISON’s
blackberry.
He reads the letter that accompanies it. We catch a couple of
sentences. “In the event of my disappearance...Friday May
22nd...Alexander Monroe’s bachelor party...cabin....Cassie”.
He frowns as he reads, becoming increasingly troubled. He
picks up his phone, and dials.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
MONTAGE: GAIL finds another letter in the cash register,
addressed to her. It’s the other half of the BFF necklace,
this one says “CASSIE”. She looks in the envelope. No letter.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
MONTAGE: Police, with dogs, search the woods, they come
across the pile of ashes from the bonfire. Shouting,
activity. There’s nothing left. Except for the other half of
the necklace, burnt out but still readable in the ashes:
“Nina”.
BACK TO:

139

EXT. LAWN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
“No Regrets” still playing, RYAN opens the scheduled text.
“Lucky I got insurance!”
He looks up, sirens are coming into the drive. A line of
police cars. The beautiful guests all turn to look, confused.
Series of shots:
AL MONROE looks over at JOE, both of them in a huge panic.
They didn’t get away with it.
ANASTASIA looks at her husband: what’s going on?
AL’S FATHER arguing with the police as they walk into the
wedding.
AL being put into handcuffs. He’s already crying.
His bride sobbing into her father’s shoulder.
JOE discreetly slips away.
All the guests looking on horrified.
RYAN’s phone beeps again amidst all the chaos. He looks down
at it, dazed.
From CASSIE:
“Enjoy the wedding! ;)”
THE END
