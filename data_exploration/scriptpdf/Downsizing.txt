INT. CAVE - NIGHT
The rustic yet comfortable dwelling of a 16-PERSON CLAN. All
are dressed in fur and leather, their hair long and braided.
Small fires burn for warmth and cooking.
Women clean up after a meal. Men smoke pipes and converse in
a language at once foreign and familiar, a blend of Nordic
tongues and English. Children chase one another and play with
simple wooden toys.
A young BOY intrudes on the adults to tug on the arm of
TERGEHL, an elder of the clan.
BOY
Come, grandfather, tell us a story.
A weary Tergehl gently declines.
Please.

BOY (CONT’D)
Please tell us a story.

Tergehl soon finds himself surrounded by a riot of begging
faces. The adults look on with amusement, quietly sharing the
children’s eagerness.
MAN
Yes, Tergehl, it has been many
lochnars since we have heard one.
(to all)
Shall we hear a story?
All chime in vigorously -- “Yes!

Yes!

A story!”

TERGEHL
All right. I will tell a story. But
then you must all promise to go to
bed.
The adults chuckle, the children shriek in delight, and all
vow to be good.
2

LATER --- The clan have gathered around Tergehl, the children
at his feet, eyes glimmering.
Grasping a gnarled staff, Tergehl scratches his chin as if the
story he knows so well were difficult to recall.
TERGEHL (CONT’D)
Long, long ago, the world was very
different. Giants walked the land.
There were so many giants that you
could not count them all even if you
counted for your entire life.

TERGEHL (CONT’D)
These giants had enormous brains.
They could speak to one another
across great distances. They taught
themselves to fly and traveled
wherever they wished, even to the
moon and the stars. Yet despite
these great powers, the giants were
not happy. They spoke in different
tongues, worshipped different gods,
and fought bitterly against one
another. No matter how much they
ate, the giants always wanted more.
They killed all the animals, chopped
down all the forests, fished all the
seas. And their fires warmed the
entire world, making it unbearably
hot.
As Tergehl continues, we are transported to -3

A small, tranquil “campus” of buildings.
EDVARDSEN INSTITUTE

TERGEHL (V.O.)
But in one of their lands, there
lived a clever wizard named Asborgön.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY
DR. JORGEN ASBJØRNSEN -- fifties, balding, closely trimmed
beard -- works in his private lab, weary and alone.
TERGEHL (V.O.)
Saddened by his greedy fellow giants,
Asborgön wished to change their
harmful ways and end their needless
suffering. For years he labored with
his powders and potions until one
day...
Dr. Asbjørnsen sedates a rat, then gives it an injection
before placing it inside a stainless steel device the size of
a microwave.
He makes notes, flips a switch, and watches a timer count
down to zero. DING!

Long accustomed to failure, Dr. Asbjørnsen opens the door of
the device with little expectation. Today, however, his eyes
widen in amazement.

INT. ASBJØRNSEN KITCHEN - DAY
Dr. Asbjørnsen looks out the window at his happy guests.
Unlike them, he seems troubled and uncertain.
Handsome wife ANNE-HELENE approaches to place a comforting
hand on his chest.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
What if it’s a mistake? A terrible
mistake?
ANNE-HELENE
Don’t be afraid, Jorgen. You know
it’s the right thing. We all do. You
were born to make this happen.

Dr. Asbjørnsen nods slightly. Summoning confidence, he takes
Anne-Helene’s hand and leads her outside.

Standing on the deck, Dr. Asbjørnsen clinks a knife to a glass
and speaks now in English.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Thank you, everyone. Thank you for
coming today, but more importantly I
want to thank you for your dedication
and hard work these past many months.
Smiles and applause.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Now then. You have probably guessed
that I have something very exciting
to announce -- very exciting, indeed.
(then --)
It is time.
A moment of hushed jubilation.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
No doubt the generations to come -perhaps all of humanity -- will thank
you for your bravery and commitment.
But today each of you must ask
whether you are truly ready to enter
this new world, for there will be no
turning back. So I ask you -- are
you ready?
Yes!

THE GROUP
Yes! We are ready!

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
The voice belongs to conference president DR. PAOLO PEREIRA,
who addresses a crowded hall.
DR. PEREIRA
...and today I’m sure you will agree
they have far exceeded even their
many impressive achievements of the
past. It gives me great pleasure to
welcome the director of the institute
and my old friend Dr. Andreas
Jacobsen, along with his colleague,
Dr. Jorgen Asbjørnsen.

6
Dr. Jacobsen emerges carrying a wooden box which he sets atop
the podium.
DR. JACOBSEN
Thank you, Dr. Pereira. Seventy-five
years ago, Mrs. Nellie Edvardsen,
overcome with guilt by the fortune
her late husband’s family had amassed
producing mustard gas during World
War I, founded our institute so that
the wonders of science could instead
be used to help mankind. Our mission
is to combat poverty, disease,
natural disasters and other
calamities that arise over time. In
the 1950s, the institute identified
over-population as mankind’s single
greatest long-term threat, the source
of all the catastrophes we are seeing
today -- extreme climate and weather
events, and the devastating impact on
food and water security. Among the
many solutions we conceived so many
years ago, one which seemed then so
ambitious, so outside our grasp, has
at last borne fruit. Today we are
proud to unveil what we fervently
believe to be the only practical,
humane and inclusive remedy to
humanity’s gravest problem. Dr.
Jorgen Asbjørnsen will now present
his findings. Are you ready, doctor?
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (O.S.)
(muffled, distant)
I am ready.
Jacobsen opens the front of the box to reveal -DR. ASBJØRNSEN, NOW JUST FIVE INCHES TALL.
As this miniature human walks out onto the podium, gasps of
astonishment ripple throughout the room. Many stand to get a
better look.
DR. JACOBSEN
Everyone, please take your seats.
Please!
As the audience quiets, Dr. Asbjørnsen takes his place behind
a tiny podium, dons reading glasses, and removes a speech from
his jacket pocket.

7
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Dr. Pereira, esteemed colleagues.
Five years ago, building on the
research of our predecessors at the
institute, my team and I discovered a
process by which all organic material
can be reduced at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately 2,744 to
one. Such a process converts a man
of 1.8 meters to just 12.9
centimeters. A wide array of flora
and fauna were subjected to this
process and, with the exception of
some fish and shellfish, absolutely
no side effects were detected.
Please lights.
The room dims. A GROUP PORTRAIT of the gathering at the
Asbjørnsen home appears on a screen above the stage -- the
first image in a PowerPoint presentation.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Once the safety of the procedure was
confirmed, thirty-six brave
volunteers joined my wife Anne-Helene
and me as the very first humans to
undergo cellular reduction.
A NAKED SUBJECT poses before reduction, arms extended like Da
Vinci’s Vitruvian man. Next he shows off his new TINY BODY
beside a metric a ruler held by enormous fingers.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT'D)
The exact science behind reduction
itself falls outside of our
discussion today, but the process is
short and painless, with only the
mild discomfort of removal and
replacement of dental and other
prosthetics.
Now we see a RECOVERY ROOM where, wrapped in blankets,
volunteers recline on miniature Le Corbusier lounges. One
tiny man drinks from an enormous eye-dropper.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Subjects are placed under light
sedation, and after a brief rest,
perhaps some crackers and applesäft,
fully recover within an hour or two.
Now a normal-sized SHORT-HAIRED DOG on a leash. The next
slide shows the same dog standing next to the ruler while a
GIANT HAND restrains him with a tiny leash.

8
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Of course, some of our community
could not bear to leave behind their
four-legged companions.
Now shots inside a WORKSHOP. Volunteers construct small
houses and buildings. Others sew tiny clothes.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
As the subjects of our own study, our
aim was not only to confirm the longterm viability of the process but
also to investigate the social and
psychological implications. Thus we
set about to live together in the
world’s very first self-sustaining
community of the small.
The next images show the building of a small VILLAGE. Group
members secure dollhouse-size dwellings onto foundations. Then
we see the hoisting of a TRANSPARENT DOME over the new
community.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Once complete, our little village,
just seven meters by eleven meters,
was placed inside a gas-permeable
enclosure designed to protect us from
the hazards of weather, animals and
insects.

Learning of the exciting news, other CONFERENCE-GOERS clamor
to gain access to the auditorium.

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
As Dr. Asbjørnsen concludes his talk, a FINAL SLIDE shows the
downsized group playing volleyball.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
...and finally, my colleagues and
I are happy to report new founts
of energy and vitality. Future
studies may support our suspicion
that decreased mass and volume
correlate directly to an increase
in longevity.
As the lights come up, a beaming Dr. Jacobsen strides from the
wings, holding aloft a half-full GARBAGE BAG.

16

9
DR. JACOBSEN
I hold in my hand all of the
uncompostable waste produced by 36
people over four years!
(holding for applause)
In this afternoon’s session, we will
outline our proposal for a two- to
three-hundred year transition for the
world to transform from big to small.
We believe that with a timely embrace
of miniaturization, our seemingly
unconquerable problems of overpopulation, climate change, and
insufficient food and water can
become a thing of the past, and human
life may safely thrive for millennia
to come.
(motioning off-stage)
Now we’d like you to meet some very
special people.
As the pièce de résistance, a cart is wheeled out carrying the
ENTIRE SMALL COMMUNITY smiling and waving. Among them, a
MOTHER nurses an infant, while at her side stands her fouryear-old son RONNI.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
And look -- there’s little Ronni, the
first small baby ever born, and his
new little sister Ulrikke.
All stand, applaud, and stamp their feet in unison -- an
astounding reception.

AUDREY (ON MACHINE)
Paul, it’s Audrey. I know we’re not
supposed to be talking, but I thought
you should know I had to put Bodie
down today. His seizures came back a
couple months ago, and I could have
had him operated on, but they cut
back my hours at work, and he was
getting really old, and...

This whole downsizing thing is
another example of runaway-train
technology leading us down a blind
alley. With all the holier-thanthou talk about saving the planet,
we can’t ignore the devastating
economic impact that’ll lead to
more poverty, which’ll lead to more
downsizing, and then more poverty,
and the whole world economy going
right down the toilet. Billions of
dollars in consumer spending are
already starting to vanish -construction and housing, the
automobile industry, the airline
industry, defense.

Look, Ron. Ron. In any major
transformation of society, are there
serious growing pains? You bet. But
we have to focus on the long term.
The fact is that at current mass and
volume, human life on Earth just
isn’t sustainable, and dealing with
that head-on makes good economic
sense, no matter how you cut it.
We find a balder, paunchier Paul seated in a booth, enjoying
happy hour with buddies KEVIN and TIM.
KEVIN
The one guy’s got a point. This
family on my block just moved away to
get small, and their house is just
sitting there. Making everybody’s
value take a dive is what they’re
doing. Just when I’m trying to
refinance.
TIM
I don’t know. Marlene thinks I
should do it just to lose the weight.

Yeah, I get a little carpal-tunnel of
my own sometimes.

Tell me about it. Medicine’s all
about covering your ass these days.
Say, weren’t you pre-med down in
Lincoln?
PAUL
Good memory. I got two years in, but
my mom got real sick and I had to
move back to Omaha. Plus, Organic
Chemistry.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Yeah, that gets a lot of people.
PAUL
I wanted to be a surgeon, actually.
I have small hands, which they say
is a real plus. Hey, we might have

Seated at his table, Paul takes a moment to look around, and
his eyes fall upon felt banners with inspirational sayings -“The door to happiness opens outward” and “The best way to
find yourself is to lose yourself in service to others.”
NEAR THE ENTRANCE a flurry of excitement suggests someone
special has arrived. It’s just a GUY in his mid-20s, but
judging from reactions -- gasps, pointing -- it’s the
ACRYLIC BOX he carries that’s causing the commotion.
The guy passes Paul and Audrey’s table and, like everyone
else, they gawk at what’s inside the box -A TINY COUPLE smiling and waving at old friends.
PAUL (CONT’D)
That’s Dave! Dave Johnson. And
Carol. I heard he was coming but I
had no idea... Man, I never would
have pegged him for someone who’d go

The guy carrying the box -- Dave Johnson’s younger brother
ANDY -- sets it down and removes the top and front.
Paul and Audrey join the onlookers, many of whom are taking
photos with their phones.
Dave and Carol walk out onto the table and speak through
little hand-held MEGAPHONES.
DAVE
Hey, everybody!
intruding!

Hope we’re not

Warm greetings all around. Dave places two tiny glasses where
his brother can retrieve them.
DAVE (CONT’D)
Andy, could you get Carol a...
Honey, what’re you having?
CAROL
Gin and tonic.

DAVE
A gin and tonic, and for me... You
know what? That sounds good. I’ll
have a gin and tonic, too.
Andy slides the impossibly small tumblers onto his palm and
heads toward the bar.
With lime!

DAVE (CONT’D)
ANDY
How am I supposed to do that?
DAVE
Just figure it out, okay?
As many migrate toward the new arrivals, a JESUIT turns on a
mic at the podium.

Don’t mean to break up the party, but
the silent auction closes in fifteen

very attractive items with no takers.

INT. FRIENDS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
At this informal after-party for an extended group of old
friends, the camera makes its way through the living room,
where little Carol Johnson holds court, standing on a coffee
table. Friends lean in to hear better.
CAROL
We weren’t going to come at first,
but then we started getting all the emails, plus my sister was having a
lump removed. She’s fine, thank God,
but I still needed to see her.
SOME FRIEND
So what’s traveling like? How’d you
get up here from New Mexico?
CAROL
Oh, we flew. Airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly.

THE KITCHEN
-- where Paul is amid a heart-to-heart with Dave, seated atop
a box of Ak-Mak Crackers.
DAVE
So after a couple years in Florida, I
moved out to Vegas and -PAUL
I remember. I think that’s about the
last time we talked.
DAVE
Yeah. Vegas wasn’t such a good
choice for me, as it turns out. Got
into some real bad habits. Pretty
much hit rock bottom.
PAUL
Sorry to hear that.
DAVE
Any other woman would have run for
the hills, but Carol, man, she’s a
saint. She stuck with me. But I
really had to come clean about
everything. And I mean everything.
You know, almost.
PAUL
And the decision to...
(makes a shrinking motion)
DAVE
Well, that’s the thing. We both
needed a change. You know, start all
over.
PAUL
It must feel good knowing you’re
making a real difference, too.
DAVE
You mean all that crap about saving
the planet? Downsizing is about
saving yourself. Takes the pressure
right off, especially money pressure.

DAVE (CONT'D)
I’m just not, you know, driven and
ambitious like the rest of my family.
It’s not who I am. Now Carol and I,
we live like kings -- a hell of a lot
better than my brothers and my
sister, I’ll tell you that. I send
them pictures all the time, but they
never respond.
PAUL
Well, I’m still living in the same
house I grew up in. Audrey’s dying
for us to move, but we’re pretty
strapped. Plus, my mom’s end-of-life
care really took a toll. I mean,
shit, I just finished paying off my
student loans.
DAVE
Well, listen, if you ever start
thinking about it seriously, here’s
my two cents. There are lots of
small communities cropping up out
there, but don’t mess around.
Leisureland’s where you want to be.
They are a little pricier, but they
were the first, and they’re still
way ahead of the curve.
PAUL
They’ve sure got a big marketing
budget.
DAVE
Lots to brag about. Best houses,
best appliances, best doctors, they
book all the big concert tours, got
all the great restaurants. The kids
love Cheesecake Factory and
Leisureland’s got three of them. And
I’m not just saying all this for the
referral credit.

Hey, sorry, could you back up a
little? I think there’s too much
garlic in that salsa.
PAUL
Oh, right.
DAVE

Suddenly a child’s SCREAM. Alarmed, Paul heads into the
living room, where he finds the HOSTS comforting their fouryear-old DAUGHTER, who has wandered downstairs and is scared
out of her wits by the sight of little Carol.
HOST MOM
It’s okay, Katie. It’s okay. She’s
a friend. She’s just smaller than we
are, that’s all.
CAROL
Hi, Katie! Hi!

INT. DUPLEX - NIGHT
Paul and Audrey come in the door, exhausted but still buzzing
about their unusual evening.
AUDREY
Well, that was sure interesting.
I’ll say.

PAUL
AUDREY
I liked little Carol. She’s got a
lot on the ball. She’s reading all
the books she always wanted to, and
she’s learning Italian. And she says
she’s never been fitter.
PAUL
They sure seem happy. Dave says
he’s getting pretty good on the
drums.
AUDREY
Next year they’re pulling the kids
out of school to spend six months at
a sister city in Tuscany. Cooking
classes, yoga, wine-tasting, the

Hate to say it, but your application
at First National bounced back. The
underwriter didn’t like the
adjustments in the appraisal. Like I
said, the market for a hundred-yearold duplex with structural issues is
pretty soft, and there are red flags
from an underwriter’s perspective. I
can try somewhere else, but frankly I
think you’re going to need more cash
up front if we want to get approved
on the type of property you’re

TONY DALE (V.O.)
Each dwelling would be a dream house,
a genuine estate within anyone’s
reach. Mass transit would be free
and efficient. The streets would be
neat and orderly, offering easy
access to shops, schools, parks,
medical services, and of course all
the recreation and entertainment you
can imagine.
Now RENDERINGS of different neighborhoods -- Alpine Village,

INT. LEISURELAND THEATER - DAY
Stage lights illuminate, theme music begins, and a platform
thrusts past the rising screen. On the platform sits a
downsized MANSION with swimming pool and tennis court.
Tanned sales professional JEFF LONOWSKI steps out of the front
door wearing a headset mic, trailed by a tiny CAMERAMAN who
transmits Jeff’s image onto a large screen.
JEFF
Thanks, Mr. Dale. Welcome,
everybody. I’m Jeff Lonowski, Senior
Product Specialist and happy
homeowner here at Leisureland
Estates. Are you having a good time?
(off initial response)
Come on, guys. You’re a heck of a
lot bigger than I am. Make some
noise! Are you having a good time?
Paul and Audrey join the enthusiastic response.

“Yes!”

JEFF (CONT’D)
That’s more like it. So what do you
think of my place? Pretty nifty,
huh? It’s the house of my dreams.
Heck, I’d say it’s the house of
anybody’s dreams. Why, an average
guy like me might have to work
twenty, thirty, even forty years to
be able to afford a spread like this.
And just wait until you see what’s
inside.
The house splits open to reveal the massive family room,
enormous bedrooms, airy kitchen. In the master suite
upstairs, and with a CAMERA GUY all her own, Jeff’s “wife”
LAURA sits in a bubble bath.
LAURA

Jeff, you’ve got to stop inviting
guests over without telling me!

JEFF
Sorry, Laura. I was only -LAURA
I mean, I finally got in the tub to

JEFF

Oh, no end of things. First I took a

INT. VIEWING CORRIDOR - DAY

62

The exit doors of the theater snap open.
Along with the rest of the audience, Paul and Audrey step onto
a wide walkway. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a first
glimpse at the actual city of Leisureland.
The initial impression is both impressive and banal. It’s
partially like a miniature theme park and partially like any
other mid-sized city.
But a couple of unusual features stand out. One is a giant
FERRIS WHEEL. Another is the CENTRAL TOWER, which functions
both as a “tent pole” for the overhead netting and as the
transfer station for an innovative and fanciful mass transit
system -- GONDOLAS traveling on cables above the city.
63

MOMENTS LATER -- Paul and Audrey peruse model homes ranging
from one-story ranches through three-story McMansions -- “The
Regency,” “The Barrington,” “The Aristocrat,” “The
Mediterranean,” “The Sportsman.”

63

At the top end, like a sumptuous Bel-Air estate, is “The
Versailles,” boasting a sticker price of $129,999.
64

INT. SALES AREA - DAY
A tracking shot through an ocean of sales desks ends on Paul
and Audrey, where a chipper SALESPERSON walks them through a
print-out of their finances.
SALESPERSON
So putting it all together, if you
liquidate your current home, vehicles
and other assets, and purchase a
Regency-level estate -- that’s a
12,000-square-foot-equivalent home on
a 1.5-acre-equivalent lot -- at the
base price of $63,000. Plus $4,500
for the Health and Fitness package.
That’s the gym, pool, sauna/steam,
hot tub, and tennis court. Then the
medical procedure for two adults.
That’s $15,000.

64

33
PAUL
Does insurance cover any of that?
SALESPERSON
No, but at Regency level you’re
already qualifying for a substantial
discount. And don’t forget the federal
tax credit. So, figuring in your
current debt, your retirement accounts
and your savings, you’re looking at
approximately $152,000 in equity, which
is a very comfortable number.
AUDREY
Comfortable? That doesn’t sound like
nearly enough.
SALESPERSON
You have to look at this column,
Audrey. Equivalent value. You’re
solidly inside the Blue Chip zone.
In Leisureland your $152,000
translates into around $12.5 million - to live on, for life.
AUDREY
Hold on. If this is such a great
thing, how come you haven’t done it?
SALESPERSON
I would in a heartbeat, but my
husband had a hip replacement, so
he’s ineligible. But look around
you. If you come back in a month,
you won’t see most of my co-workers
still here. People take jobs just
for the discount. Did you see Jeff’s
little show upstairs -- the house
that opens up? He used to sit right
over there. Of course, he doesn’t
have to work anymore, but he’s a real
ham -- just loves the attention.
Anyway, how’s all this sounding?
Would the Regency be your first
choice? Or should we be looking at
something a little more deluxe?
Audrey looks at Paul.
PAUL
Honey, pick anything you like.

A farewell party occupies the back. Friends and family
gather around four or five reserved tables. We catch
snippets of conversations with different FRIENDS -- first up
is GINA.
AUDREY
I mean, sure, I was on the fence
about it for most of the year. It’s
pretty scary when you think about it
at first. But then when my college
roommate Patty Loomis called to say
she and her husband were doing it,
and all the reasons why, I turned to
Paul and said okay, you win. Let’s
go for it.
GINA
(hugging her)
I’m just going to miss you so much.
AUDREY
Oh, Gina, I’m going to miss you too.
But, you know, it’s not like we’re
dying. We’re just relocating and
changing things up a bit. We’ll be
back at least once a year. And you
and Tim can come down and stay with
us anytime. We have like five guest
rooms. Open invitation. Stay as
long as you like.
Gina laughs through tears at this joke.

LATER -- BARRY talks with Paul and Audrey.
BARRY
And you guys didn’t consider Treasure
Island out in Palm Desert?
PAUL
Yeah, we checked it out, but...

I mean, I liked it all right, but
Audrey thought they were a little
stingy with the amenities, especially
for what they charge in monthly
maintenance.

Glad you made it, Larry.
AUDREY
What can I get you, Dad?
Let me.

PAUL
You guys visit.

LARRY LUSTIG
Oh, just a beer. Any beer.
PAUL
(exiting)
Comin’ right up.
AUDREY
I wish Mom weren’t taking it so hard.
LARRY LUSTIG
Well, you know your mother. To tell
you the truth, I was pretty skeptical
myself at first. You remember Jerry
Gross. Well, I called him up the
other day. He and Bev retired down
there, did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing. He says they’re
getting along just fine, never
better. Says he feels younger every
day, says one dollar buys a thousand
dollars worth of stuff.
(MORE)

37
LARRY LUSTIG (CONT'D)
Of course they need that with all the
medication Bev takes. But yeah, they
play nine holes every morning. Even
taking a two-week cruise up to Alaska
next month. First class stateroom,
gourmet food, whole nine yards. Says
the whole thing’s costing around $150.
No, I see the appeal. And apparently
there’s zero crime. That’s what I
keep telling your mother.
73

LATER -- The party has wound down, and Paul and Audrey enjoy
a final nightcap with close friends, including Tim, a friend
of Paul’s we’ve met before. A DRUNK GUY wanders over.
DRUNK GUY
Hey, you guys are getting small,
right?
PAUL
That’s right. My wife and I.
DRUNK GUY
My friend over there has a question.
No offense, but do you think if
you’re that small, you should still
have all the same rights as the rest
of us? Same right to vote?
PAUL
Why wouldn’t we?
DRUNK GUY
Well, let’s see. You’re not buying
as many products, you’re not paying
as much income tax, not really
participating in our economy. In
fact, you’re costing us money. And
jobs.
TIM
Hey, hey. That’s enough. We’re all
just having a good time here.
DRUNK GUY
I’m just asking a simple academic
question. If anything, a quartervote. At most.

Come on, buddy. Let’s take a hike.

All that remains is a mattress on the floor. Audrey sleeps as
Paul reads by the dreary light of a sconce. Without warning,
she begins to cry.
PAUL
Oh, honey.
Her shoulders convulse.

Paul pulls off his reading glasses.

PAUL (CONT’D)
Honey, honey, I know. I know this is
a big step. It’s the biggest thing
we’ll do in our lives. I know, I

AUDREY
You don’t know anything! You did
this! Why did you have to choose
such a stupid career? Why did you
have to be so... unambitious? Helping
people? What about helping yourself?
What about helping me? You’re so
goddamned stubborn! You did this!
PAUL
Hey, hey, hey, that’s completely
unfair. You’re the one who’s never
satisfied with anything. You’re the
one who says I spend too much time at
work. You’re the one who wants to
live in a palace.
You’re the one who says we can’t have
kids until we’re better off. You’re

Nervous?

A little.

PAUL
You know.

MOTHER
Don’t be. It’s the best thing you’ll
ever do. And the medical part is no
big deal. Completely painless.
Except if you have a lot of dental redos like my Dougie here. He had to
keep going back because he’d waited
too long to get a root canal while he
was still big. I said, Dougie, those
are your teeth. You only get one
set. Anyway, you don’t want to hear
about that. We just got back from
Turks and Caicos. Have you ever been
to Turks and Caicos?
No.

PAUL AND AUDREY
MOTHER
It’s so pretty. Back in Spokane, we
never went anywhere. But now it’s so
easy and so cheap. You get in this
contraption down at the travel
center, and you don’t have to budge
until you arrive at the hotel. And
the best part is you don’t have to
take your shoes off in security. I
don’t like taking my shoes off once I
have them on.

you, Audrey Lustig Safranek,
understand that, of your own free
will, you will undergo the permanent

commonly known as “downsizing?” And
that following this procedure your

AUDREY (ON PHONE)
Oh, Paul, they shaved my head, then
they started shaving off my eyebrows,

can’t leave my family, all my friends.
I can’t do it. I’m sorry, Paul. I

But I realized I was just trying to
make you happy. I should have been
thinking more about myself.

Snazzy.

Well, sir, here’s the key to your

They stock the kitchen with some
standard items, but one thing I should
warn you about is the dairy -- it takes
a while for your stomach to adjust to
milk and cheese, so go easy. Something
about the bacteria. And careful with
the hot water. It’s all on one central
system, and they keep it cranked up
pretty high. I’m surprised they
haven’t had a lawsuit yet.
PAUL
Thanks, Matt. You’re a nice guy.
Paul gets out and trudges toward his new house.
MATT
You need anything, you call me.
Anything at all. And Paul?

For years both the Department of
Homeland Security and the INS have
been warning about the ease with
which downsized persons -- from
illegal immigrants to potential

This Costco is just one of thousands

them already dead, two more dying

On Friday, the lone survivor, a 45year-old woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,
was transferred to a hospital at
Leisureland Estates in New Mexico,
widely considered the country’s top
medical center for the small.
Doctors were forced to amputate a
portion of an infected leg, and today
her condition is described as fair
but stable.

BRIAN FAKLER (V.O.)
Yesterday, U.S. officials were able
to question the woman for the first
time. According to a statement from
the Department of Homeland Security,
Ms. Tran claims to have been jailed
for her environmental and political
activism and, along with dozens of
other dissidents, was miniaturized
against her will in a Vietnamese
prison facility. If true, this would
bolster accusations by human rights
groups that repressive governments
around the world are forcibly
downsizing scores of prisoners and
political undesirables.

everything. I told them in the
kitchen. Now they’re asking to be
paid.
DUSAN
Oui, ma cherie. J’arrive.
(back inside)
Anyway, Paul, listen, if tonight
noise disturbs you, just come
upstairs and talk to me. Don’t make
big show like last time yelling like
crazy man. We are neighbors. And
neighbors are friends. What’s
better, come to the party.
PAUL
Thanks, but like I said, we’re just
trying to have a nice, quiet dinner.
So try to keep it down, okay?

64
DUSAN
Yes, darling. Of course.
Dusan puts a finger to his lips and makes a point of tiptoeing to the door, closing it without a sound.
PAUL
Kind of a jerk, right?
KRISTEN
What’s he even doing here? Aren’t
there like a ton of small cities in
Europe?

INT. PAUL’S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Their date at an end, Paul walks Kristen down the hallway.
Booming bass notes penetrate through the ceiling.
PAUL
Yeah, small party.
(imitating)
Just a few friends.
Arriving at the elevator -KRISTEN
Well, thanks for a really nice time.
Plus, cooking and all. Sorry I have
to leave so early, but, you know, the
sitter.
The elevator opens, and drunken SPANIARDS spill out.
PAUL
One floor up.
They disappear back into the elevator.
PAUL (CONT’D)
So... Sunday. I was hoping we could
bring Jonah. I’d like to meet him.
Yeah.

KRISTEN
Maybe.

Paul leans in for a kiss.

Kristen allows it, but her heart’s

PAUL
Is something wrong?

65
KRISTEN
No. I mean, you’re a wonderful guy,
Paul, and I’ve really enjoyed hanging
out with you...
PAUL
(face darkening)
Uh-huh.
KRISTEN
...but if I’m honest about how I’m
feeling, I just, well, I think it’s
still a little early for me to -Fine.

PAUL
I get it.

Fine.

Paul smacks the “down” button and walks away.
KRISTEN
No, Paul, listen, I only meant, if
we’re bringing Jonah into it -PAUL
Have a good night.

toward the party.

INT. DUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

134

Paul steps inside to find DOZENS OF PEOPLE -- various
languages, fashionable eyewear, distinctive shoes.
Dusan's chic apartment could not be more different from Paul’s
with its double-high ceilings, wide doorways, fireplaces, hip
furnishings.
Feeling instantly out of place, Paul is about to leave.

Paul!

DUSAN
You came.

And you bring the

PAUL
Peace offering.
DUSAN
Look, everybody. This is Paul, my
neighbor. Look at what he brings me - a real rose. A real fucking rose!
(to Paul)
Do you think any of these other
ungrateful sons of bitches think to
bring something to Dusan? Only you.
I like you. What about your blonde
American friend?
Paul shakes his head.

Dusan nods in approval.

DUSAN (CONT’D)
Why bring sand to the beach?
(escorting Paul)
Look, I know I said it was going to
be a small party, but it’s not my
fault. I make two or three phone
calls to close friends, and look what
happens. Everyone comes. Nothing
else to do in this fucking city after
10 o’clock. This I do not
understand. It’s not as if so many
people have work in the morning. Is
the worst trait of small people -they are lazy. Not all, but most.
Like this lazy guy. Konrad!
KONRAD is an older German in nautical attire -- turtleneck,
double-breasted blazer -- helping himself to a splendid buffet
of both normal-sized and small gourmet foods.
KONRAD
What’s that you say about me?
lies are you telling?

What

DUSAN
Just that in the small world no one
wants to work.
KONRAD
What did you expect? That is the
wonderful thing about becoming small.
You are immediately rich. Unless you
are very poor. Then you are only
small.

67
PAUL
Actually, I wouldn’t call myself
poor, but I have a job -DUSAN
Konrad is sea captain. Never more
than ten meters from his boat.
KONRAD
I do like my boat.

Come, I’ll show you.

Locking arms with Paul and speaking with sudden intimacy,
Konrad leads him onto -A135

EXT. DECK - NIGHT
Konrad points out a YACHT in the marina below.
KONRAD
There she is -- Sonja, my beauty. An
exact replica of an English yacht
from 1927. You see, I am from many
generations, all the way to my
grandfathers and my father — all sea
captains. I remember very well I was
seven years old when my grandfather
took me for the first time on his
boat. I will never forget the
rocking of the waves, the sound of
the wind, the blackness of the water.
From that moment I knew I would be a
sea captain too.
PAUL
What brings you to Leisureland?
KONRAD
Dusan. He even convinced me to become
small, mostly for the women and the
parties. And, frankly, my wife had
all the money, so after she left,
things became, let’s say, tricky.
PAUL
I can relate.
KONRAD
It’s really quite wonderful to be
small, don’t you think?
PAUL
I’d say it has its pluses and
minuses.

A135

68
KONRAD
I am here in your city about once a
year, always with Dusan. Next week I
will be in the Seychelles, and two
weeks after that I’ll meet friends for
a month of sailing on Lake Titicaca.
Can you believe I’ve never been to
Lake Titicaca?
PAUL
Wait, how do you get your boat from
place to place? You can’t sail it.
KONRAD
Fed-Ex, my boy. Sonja travels faster
than I do.

INT. SITTING ROOM/BILLIARD AREA - NIGHT
Paul wanders around the party, an amiable smile on his face.
He moseys into another room, where a handsome YOUNG MAN holds
court.
A small group of party-goers surround him, hanging onto his
every word and laughing at his jokes. Paul joins them,
standing at the back.
PAUL
(to a guy)
Who is that?
GUY
Who’s that? That’s Little Ronni.
PAUL
Little Ronni?
GUY
The first small baby ever born.

PAUL
Little Ronni? Holy shit.
Little Ronni?

You

That’s

Paul gathers his courage and makes his way over to Ronni.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry to interrupt, but are you
really Little Ronni?

69
LITTLE RONNI
Well, maybe not so little anymore,
but yes, that’s me.
PAUL
Wow. Would you mind if I got a
picture?
Paul holds out his phone for a selfie. Little Ronni gamely
puts an arm around Paul and pulls him hard into his chest.
Big smiles.
136

INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

136

Paul wanders down the steps toward the pool area, where
revelers DANCE. There he watches Dusan dancing with complete
abandon, king of the party, sandwiched between Mariette, whom
he kisses open-mouthed, and another woman.
Paul is approached by a hippie-ish YOUNG WOMAN, like one might
meet at a jam-band concert. Paul returns her enigmatic smile.
She hugs him and whispers in his ear.
PAUL
(above the music)
Thanks. So are you.
The woman begins dancing.
I’m Paul.

Paul gamely joins in.

PAUL (CONT’D)
I live downstairs.

She removes a pill from a tiny case and offers it to him.
PAUL (CONT’D)
What is it?
She wiggles her eyebrows suggestively.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I need to know what it is.
Allergies.
She places the pill on her extended tongue, sweetening the
offer. Paul demurs. She shrugs and turns away.
Wait.

PAUL (CONT’D)
Paul turns her around and kisses her, sucking her tongue and
the pill deeply into his mouth. He assumes there’s more fun
in store, but she just nods approvingly, strokes his cheek and
dances away.

Locking the door, Paul sticks his finger down his throat in an
unsuccessful attempt to induce vomiting.

INT. DUSAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A circle of people converse in Greek. Paul wanders by, eyes
wide, smiling, just enjoying the sounds.
PAUL
(interrupting)
I’m going to take off my shoes.

139

139

INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
Paul is peaking -- eyes shut, arms overhead, dancing to a
rhythm only vaguely related to the music. Dusan wanders by.
DUSAN
Having a good time?
PAUL
I just realized... There’s no reason
to be unhappy. I mean, I’m here in
Leisureland, but really I’m
everywhere. I’m connected to
everybody. Everything’s... just the
way it’s supposed to be.
PAUL’S DRUG-INDUCED POV -- streaked and vibrant.
laughs, looking directly into camera.

Dusan

DUSAN
Yes, baby! As long as the world is
going to shit, let’s make a little
money and let’s have a good time.
(in Serbian)
You’re about to enter whole new world!
FADE OUT.
140

UNDER BLACK -The sound of a DOORBELL.
INT. DUSAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
CLOSE on Paul passed out on the floor, wedged between a sofa
and a coffee table. The doorbell rings again, startling him
awake.

140

71
PAUL’S POV -- Dusan’s hairy legs stagger toward the door,
stop short, then approach him.
DUSAN (O.S.)
Who is that? Who is down there?
PAUL
It’s me, Paul.
Paul who?

DUSAN (O.S.)
Who is Paul?

PAUL
From downstairs.

You know, Paul.

The doorbell again.
DUSAN
Enough with the fucking doorbell!
He opens the door.
WOMAN’S VOICE
(unusual Asian accent)
Good morning, Mr. Dusan. We come
clean for you.
Paul watches the legs of a small cleaning crew enter, his
interest piqued by one person’s crude PROSTHETIC FOOT.
141

141

INT. DUSAN’S KITCHEN - DAY
Paul shuffles in to find Dusan rooting around.
DUSAN
Fucking hyenas ate everything. I am
surprised there is even still water
when I turn on the sink.
Paul sits on a stool, and Dusan pours him coffee.
next room comes the sound of vacuuming.
DUSAN (CONT’D)
So you had fun last night, yes? You
did not know you were so lucky to
have exciting neighbor such as me.
PAUL
Never been to a party like that. So
many Europeans. Did you know Little
Ronni was here? I mean, he’s
historic.

From the

72
DUSAN
And boring. Good looking dumb
Norwegian guy goes around the world
having sex with everybody -- women,
men, hermaphrodites, dogs, goats,
monkeys. He’ll be the first small
baby to die of syphilis. But yes,
okay, historic.
Glancing into the next room, Paul notices that the one-legged
woman is the one steering the vacuum cleaner.
PAUL
Apparently he still lives in the
original colony, you know, over in
Norway. I’ve always wanted to see
that.
DUSAN
It’s all right.
PAUL
You’ve been there?
DUSAN
I go once or twice a year.
Konrad, too. We make business there.
Good business.
PAUL
Man, that really must be something to
see. You can’t even find pictures of
it online.
Dusan studies Paul.
DUSAN
Yes, my friend. The world is filled
with things to see. I don’t know
you, Paul, but I like you. I like
you very much. And my advice is to
get out of your disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes.
Don’t be so American. Why you even
are small if you live like that, like
a rat in a cage? And that ugly
woman.
Kristen?

PAUL
She’s not ugly.

73
DUSAN
Only your furniture is more ugly.
You are nice guy, Paul, but little
bit pathetic guy. You need help -you know, how to think about life.
Last night you dance and you laugh,
but inside you cry.
PAUL
Hey, who are you to talk to me like
that?
DUSAN
I am your neighbor, Dusan Mirkovic.
And neighbors are friends. And
friends tell friends the truth.
Okay, maybe sometimes I’m a little
bit asshole, but the world needs
assholes. Otherwise where would shit
come out?
142

142

INT. DUSAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Paul sits with Dusan on the sofa. Dusan smokes a cigar.
some point Konrad wanders by on his way to get coffee.

At

DUSAN
When I see big people becoming small,
all the new small cities, I see
opportunity. I ask myself, Dusan,
why the people they become small? To
help the environment? Please. They
become small to have the things which
until now were only for the rich,
which, by the way, is the genius of
the concept. So I say to my brother
Srdjan -- I work with my brother.
He’s still big.
(low)
My wife, too, by the way.
PAUL
(also low)
Your wife? How does that work?
Dusan gives a quick, furtive “thumbs-up” sign accompanied by a
satisfied nod.
DUSAN
So I say, why not bring very special
items, luxury items, to the small
consumer? The things no one else is
thinking to bring?

74

Such as?

PAUL
Dusan holds up his cigar.
DUSAN
Cohiba Espléndido. Cuba. The best
cigar in the world. How much you pay
for this when you are big?
(Paul shrugs)
Forty-five, fifty dollars. But when
you are small, I will sell you this
cigar for one dollar.
PAUL
Still seems like a lot. I mean, a
pack of cigarettes is what, twenty
cents, most of it tax?
DUSAN
Not if you remember paying fifty
dollars for the same cigar. If now
you pay only one dollar, you say, I
am so happy to be small! And from
one Cohiba, we make more than 2000
cigars. Okay, maybe the cigars are
not actually made in Cuba. Maybe
they are rolled by little Albanians
in Podgorica, but who cares? And
this is just the one thing. Also
perfumes and colognes, wines Bordeaux
and Burgundy, brandies and Port and
Calvados, caviar, jamón ibérico,
truffles. My brother and I are now
in seven small cities. All around
the world. Seven.
PAUL
Is all that legal?
DUSAN
Baby, this is Wild West time. Who
has time to chase after some fucking
Serbian guy five inches tall over a
few cigars and some wine? And
listen, Paul, anything you want, I
can get for you. Anything, anytime.
Again Paul notices with concern the one-legged cleaning woman
as she hobbles upstairs on her way to another room.
PAUL
(rising)
Excuse me a minute.

INT. DUSAN’S BATHROOM - DAY
Paul appears in the doorway and finds the woman rummaging
through Dusan’s medicine cabinet and putting some items into
her smock.
Hello.

PAUL
She spins around, startled. We may recognize her from the
news report -- Vietnamese dissident NGOC LAN TRAN. Her
green cap reads “Jade Palace Cleansing Service.”
PAUL (CONT’D)
Can I talk to you for a minute?
NGOC LAN
These medicine too old. Too old.
clean, take away for you.
(holding out a bottle)
Na-pro-shien. What this do?

I

PAUL
Naproxen. That’s an antiinflammatory.
(off her blank stare)
It helps with pain and swelling.
She pockets the bottle and picks up another.
NGOC LAN
And this one, what this one do?
PAUL
That’s... Vicodin. That’s also a
pain killer, but it’s, well, you want
to be careful with that one.
NGOC LAN
(pocketing it)
Pain killer? Pain killer good.
PAUL
You know, this isn’t my apartment,
and I know you’re probably in a lot
of pain, but I don’t think you
should be stealing pills.
NGOC LAN
I no steal. They too old, no good.
Mr. Dusan, he say me okay I take
away things. Pills for sick friend.
(closing the cabinet)
Okay, I finish now. Bathroom clean.

She pushes past Paul, and he follows her into -A144

INT. DUSAN’S SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A144

PAUL
Well, whatever’s wrong with your
“friend,” I see you have a really,
really bad prosthetic foot. I’m sure
it’s causing pain in your right hip and
knee, probably both knees. Lower back.
NGOC LAN
How you know these things?

You doctor?

PAUL
I’m an occupational therapist. Wait a
second. I know you. You’re that -- Oh,
my God, you’re that woman from a couple
years ago, the dissident. From Thailand
or someplace. What’s your name?
NGOC LAN
Tran Ngoc Lan. Vietnam.
PAUL
Yeah, right, I remember you lost your
leg below the knee. That’s you? Wow.
(to Dusan and Konrad
downstairs)
Hey, Dusan, do you know who this is?
DUSAN
Yes, of course, the famous Ngoc Lan
Tran. Dramatic escape from
Vietnamese prison and almost died so
that now she can clean my house.
America, big land of opportunity!
Dusan and Konrad share a big laugh.
144

INT. DUSAN’S DINING ROOM - DAY

144

Ngoc Lan sits in a chair while Paul cups a kneecap and
manipulates the foreleg, then repeats the process with the
other leg. Dusan and Konrad watch, as do, from afar, the rest
of the cleaning crew.
Ngoc Lan submits to the exam but seems more interested in Paul
himself than in what he’s saying.

77
PAUL
Okay, I’m going to push down and you
try to push up. Mm-hm. You’ve got
some pretty severe asymmetrical
muscle compensation.
DUSAN
Paul, you are full of surprises. You
can do this but you work shit job
answering phones?
PAUL
When I moved here, I didn’t think I’d
be working, so I let my license
expire. And to get a license now in
a different state... it’s a boring
story.
NGOC LAN
(to the other cleaners)
Hey, you no look me! You work now.
Trabajo! Trabajo!
As they scatter, Paul places Ngoc Lan's hand on her own knee
and moves her foreleg up and down.
PAUL
You feel that crunching? That’s
arthritis. It’s already pretty
bad.
(releasing it)
I hate to say it, but if you don’t
take care of it, pretty soon you’re
going to need a new knee. And that’s
just for starters. Maybe a new hip
too. You should see a specialist as
soon as you can and get a whole new
foot.
Ngoc Lan says nothing.

Does she understand?

PAUL (CONT’D)
In the meantime, I could make a few
adjustments to your existing
prosthetic and give you some pointers
on how to walk better. I hate to see
you suffer needlessly after all
you’ve been through.
NGOC LAN
Okay, I finish work you come with me.

78
PAUL
Great. I’ll just grab some tools and
we can do it right here.
NGOC LAN
No. I say you before my friend sick,
need pills. You come with me my
house help her. You help her.
This situation is getting confusing and weird.
PAUL
I’m sorry, I guess I wasn’t clear.
See, I can help you with this, but
I’m not a doctor. Your friend,
whatever’s wrong with her, should go
to a clinic or hospital.
NGOC LAN
Clinic no good! I take her clinic
wait too long time. Stupid doctor
say no help for her, no do nothing.
He no good stupid doctor in big
world, now he small. You come with
me! You come with me now!
Paul looks to Dusan for help, but Dusan just shrugs.
145

INT. GONDOLA - DAY
Paul, now cleaned up, rides with Ngoc Lan in a crowded car.
The other PASSENGERS, many in work uniforms, are mostly
Latino.

146

EXT. GONDOLA STATION - DAY
Ngoc Lan and Paul exit the station amid a flow of humanity.
PAUL
You live near here?
NGOC LAN
Still far.
PAUL
Maybe we should grab a car.
No car.

NGOC LAN
This way.

Ngoc Lan limps past him, pointing toward a shuttle stop where
three BUSES are taking on passengers.

79
147

EXT. FAR SIDE OF LEISURELAND - DAY

147

The bus drives away from central Leisureland and enters a very
modest section of town -- smallish houses, LATINO CHILDREN
playing in the streets.
148

INT. BUS - DAY
Ngoc Lan and Paul have found a seat, but the aisle is packed.
Buoyant RANCHERA MUSIC on the speakers contrasts with the
weary faces of the passengers.
PAUL
If you don’t mind my asking, you
were so famous a couple years ago.
Everybody was talking about you. I
would’ve thought you’d be writing
books and making speeches. I mean,
how’d you wind up cleaning houses?
NGOC LAN
Need money for live. After TV box I
stay hospital so long time, almost
die. Then three host family, but too
much problems. Leisureland peoples
too selfish. Better I live only me,
work job make money.
PAUL
But after all you’ve been through, I
would have thought for sure Tony Dale
would have been happy to -NGOC LAN
Don’t say me Tony Dale!
(mocking)
Tony Dale. Tony Dale.
(a sudden tirade)
Everybody say Tony Dale so nice
guy, help people. I say he bad
man, make Leisureland people
selfish. I say you why Tony Dale
still big? Be careful you ask him
this. He no like this question. I
ask him, he say me, “You go back
Vietnam TV box, you talk like
this.” He say me, “I save your
life my hospital, make you better,
now why you make bad PR for me.”
He say me ungrateful. He say me
selfish. He say me female dog!
(MORE)

148

80
NGOC LAN (CONT'D)
Female dog okay Vietnamese, but
female dog English very bad name
call woman. Tony Dale.
Paul nods politely at the outburst. Glancing outside, he
notes that the bus is now passing through -149

EXT. NO MAN’S LAND - DAY

149

An area of undeveloped lots and fields.
One entire square block has been removed, the resulting hole
surrounded by safety barriers. NORMAL-SIZED MEN in hard hats
work down below, only their heads visible above ground.
150

INT. BUS - DAY

150

Paul now cranes his neck to look through the front windshield
and discovers that the bus is headed directly toward THE WALL
encircling Leisureland.
151

EXT. FAR SIDE OF LEISURELAND - DAY

151

The bus disappears into the wall’s shadow and heads toward a
TUNNEL in the wall. Graffiti around the entrance has made it
look like the pupil of a giant eye.
152

INT. BUS - DAY

152

The bus motors through the darkness of the tunnel, finally
emerging into the light.
153

EXT. WORKERS’ CITY - DAY
The bus comes to a stop, and Paul follows Ngoc Lan off.
This is essentially a BORDER TOWN. Here the protective
overhead netting hangs much lower and is poorly maintained -Paul notices the sagging weight of a BIRD CARCASS.
As Ngoc Lan leads him, he continues to take in a world he had
no idea existed. Most imposing is the sight of -NORMAL-SIZED TRAILERS
of the sort used for portable classrooms or construction
offices. Here they’ve been re-purposed into apartment
buildings, with rows of tiny windows and crisscrossed bootleg
wiring.

153

81
Ngoc Lan leads Paul up the entrance ramp to one particular
trailer named ALONDRA, dodging Spanish-speaking CHILDREN
tobogganing past on normal-size bottle caps.
154

INT. ALONDRA APARTMENTS - DAY

154

Stepping inside, Paul pauses to absorb the extraordinary
interior view. Like inside an Embassy Suites or a highsecurity prison, walkways on every floor surround an ATRIUM.
On the ground floor, RESIDENTS watch a 26” television, which
in this context rises three stories tall. The sound of a
garish Spanish-language program echoes throughout.
Ngoc Lan heads toward a staircase and begins to climb, her
speed impressive.
PAUL
(catching up)
Can I ask how high we’re going?
NGOC LAN
Seven floor.
PAUL
Isn’t there an elevator?
NGOC LAN
Elevator broken. You walk with me.
155

INT. ALONDRA SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

155

Paul arrives out of breath, but Ngoc Lan seems fine.
As they proceed down the walkway, Paul and Ngoc Lan navigate
around chatting NEIGHBORS and CHILDREN at play. Murals and
graffiti adorn the walls, and the rickety railings are
reinforced with dental floss.
156

INT. NGOC LAN’S APARTMENT - DAY
Ngoc Lan and Paul enter this tiny apartment decorated with
improvised furnishings -- a table made from a spray can lid,
chairs carved out of champagne corks, curtains fashioned from
old handkerchiefs.
Most striking are the images of BUTTERFLIES cut from normalsize magazines used to cover the walls.
Ngoc Lan pulls back a curtain to reveal GLADYS, a barely
conscious Salvadoran woman lying on a piece of foam.

156

82
NGOC LAN
This lady Gladys. Gladys my friend.
She very sick.
(loudly)
Gladys, how you feel? ¿Cómo está?
¿Cómo está? I bring food for you. I
bring doctor. This man doctor.
Hombre médico. Médico.
Gladys offers Paul a weak, hopeful smile.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
This lady Gladys alone, no have
nobody. Husband die Mexico when they
make small. Stupid people forget
take out gold from teeth, head
explode.
What?

PAUL
NGOC LAN
Husband head explode. Head explode.
From teeth. She come here alone, no
money. I meet her she work maid
first host family, rich Leisureland
people. Now she sick, no more work.
(pointing)
Okay you take care for her.
As Ngoc Lan goes to fill a pail from a crude faucet, Paul has
a wave of panic and pulls her aside.
PAUL
I can’t do anything for her. That
woman is really sick. She looks like
she might die.
NGOC LAN
Oh yes she die soon. Cancer. Cancer
all over stomach. I be with her die.
Most bad thing die alone.
Ngoc Lan kneels at Gladys’s side and gives her water.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
(loud whisper)
Come on, be like doctor. Make her
feel good.
(to Gladys)
Hombre médico.
Paul draws a deep breath and assumes the role he’s been asked
to play, squatting down and dredging up his medical Spanish.

83
PAUL
Hola, señora. ¿Dónde le duele?
GLADYS
Ay, doctor, me duele todo, todo.
no me queda mucho tiempo en esta
vida.

Ya

Ngoc Lan reaches into her sack and begins placing bottle after
bottle of drugs onto a table.
NGOC LAN
Which pill good for her?
she take?

How much

PAUL
I have no idea.
NGOC LAN
But you know things. One, two, five,
what? Which one most strong?
That one.

PAUL
Percocet.

NGOC LAN
(opening it)
Yes, Percocet. Very good for pain.
Try two.
Two?

PAUL
NGOC LAN
This lady very sick.

Paul helps her administer the pills.
PAUL
These are for the pain.
GLADYS
Gracias, doctor.
PAUL
You rest now.
Gladys closes her eyes.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Have you been moving her around?
know, like every few hours? You
don’t want her to get bed sores.

Ngoc Lan shakes her head.
Here.

PAUL (CONT’D)
Let’s move her.

He instructs Ngoc Lan with gestures, and they begin to roll
Gladys onto her side.
See?
157

NGOC LAN
You know things.

LATER -- Gladys now lies in a narcotized state.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
Thank you Mr. Dusan friend.
Gladys good.

You help

PAUL
Now let’s make those adjustments for
you.
(reaching for his tools)
I’ll just need you to remove your
foot.
NGOC LAN
Not now. I very tired. You go
away. I stay with Gladys. You go
away now.
With no further ceremony, Ngoc Lan goes and busies herself in
the kitchen.
PAUL
Well. Some other time, I guess. I
just don’t know when I’m going to see
you again.
NGOC LAN
You come Thursday, okay? Thursday
morning you fix leg. You come ten
o’clock.
At a loss, Paul opens the front door.

My name’s Paul, by the way.

EXT. ALONDRA APARTMENTS - NIGHT
It’s dark now. As Paul exits the building, his attention is
drawn by whooping and shouting.
A jubilant GROUP OF MEN have just rolled up a normal-sized can
of TECATE BEER. On the count of “Uno, dos, tres,” they hoist
it up and begin to spin it and shake it.
Finally, they drop it on the ground, and with practiced ease
one of them punctures the can with a screwdriver, sending a
geyser of beer high into the air.
They roll the can this way and that to guide the spray into
their mouths. Others laugh as they are hosed down with beer.
Paul watches, wistful at the spectacle of this simple
pleasure.

INT. TOLL-FREE CALL CENTER - DAY
Paul squints at his monitor, painfully aware of the
senselessness of his job.
PAUL
Let’s see. Extra Large is still
available in glacier, pebble, tulip,
cayenne, moss and aubergine.
WOMAN (ON PHONE)
Cayenne, is that like red?
PAUL
More of a brownish red.

Like brick.

WOMAN (ON PHONE)
I don’t like brick. Do you think
moss is pretty?
PAUL
You know, I don’t know, lady.
you please just pick a color?

Could

WOMAN (ON PHONE)
Don’t be short with me.
PAUL
What did you say?
WOMAN (ON PHONE)
Oooh, I see. You’re small. You’re
one of those disgusting little small

PAUL
That’s right. And you’re extra large.
Paul tosses his headset on his desk and walks away.

Carrying a small canvas bag, Paul knocks on Ngoc Lan’s door.
Soon Ngoc Lan opens it and invites Paul in.

Where’s Gladys?
She die.
Oh, no.

I think maybe I give her too much

loosens her leg.

Ngoc Lan sits and

NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
Okay, you fix my foot quick. You do
quick. One hour. Must clean house
soon.
PAUL
I can’t exactly fix it, but I can
make a few adjustments, and I can
give you some pointers on how to walk
better. It’s a process. And I think
I found the right orthopedist for
you.
Ngoc Lan slides the prosthesis off and hands it over.
162

LATER -- Paul works on the crudely constructed foot, pushing 162
and pulling on the hinges and springs. Now on CRUTCHES, Ngoc
Lan manages to bring him a cup of tea.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Oh, thank you. Very nice.

87
NGOC LAN
You finish soon okay?
Go work soon.

I very busy.

PAUL
I’m getting there.
Ngoc Lan sits.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I guess you like butterflies.
(pointing at the walls)
Butterflies.
NGOC LAN
Yes I like very much. When I little

PAUL
You must miss your village.
NGOC LAN
No more village. Government make

PAUL
Too much water?
NGOC LAN
Big water make electricity.

NGOC LAN
Yes, dam. They make dam. Many

Huh.

PAUL
What happened to your sister?

NGOC LAN
She die prison. Too much cold.
Chest fill up bad. She die.
A solemn moment passes. Then Paul applies extra force to a
stubborn coupling and -- KKRCH! -- the joint pops apart and
the entire prosthetic collapses in his hands.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)

Paul tries awkwardly to shield the broken foot from view.
PAUL

NGOC LAN
Many people depend for me! I okay

PAUL
You needed a new foot anyway.
We’re going to get you a good one.
Is that so hard to understand?
Jesus!
NGOC LAN
No say Jesus bad way!
PAUL
Now I’m supposed to watch my

He shoots her a resentful glance, then notices other CREW
MEMBERS whispering to each other and laughing.

INT. LUXURIOUS HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Paul cleans the stove. Ngoc Lan sits on a chair helping the
LADY OF THE HOUSE go through the refrigerator as they pull out
leftovers and stack them in a box.
LADY OF THE HOUSE
And you can take this -- that’s
turkey casserole from a couple days
ago. These avocados are a bit soft,
but --

90
NGOC LAN
Thank you, yes. I take all these.
LADY OF THE HOUSE
(a Tupperware container)
I think this one’s leftover pasta. It
might be a little too old.
Ngoc Lan peels open the lid and peers inside.
NGOC LAN
In prison we die for such food.

EXT. T.G.I. FRIDAYS - DAY

166

Ngoc Lan waits in a car outside this downsized version of the
familiar franchise.
Accompanied by the manager ROGER, Paul exits the front door
and heads toward the car. Both carry take-out food
containers. Paul opens the trunk.
ROGER
(to Ngoc Lan)
Not too many leftover entrées today,
but I threw in lots of baked potato
soup.
NGOC LAN
Thank you, Roger.
ROGER
Finally got yourself a helper, huh,
Ngoc Lan?
NGOC LAN
This Paul. He break my foot.
ROGER
How’d you manage that, buddy?
NGOC LAN
He stupid.
PAUL
Long story. We’re sorting it out.

INT. ALONDRA APARTMENTS LOBBY - NIGHT
Ngoc Lan threads her way on crutches through TV VIEWERS in the
atrium. Some call out warm greetings. Paul follows with
trays of left-over food.

91
They reach SEÑOR CARDENAS, a frail old man dozing in a
wheelchair. Ngoc Lan gives him a gentle nudge.
NGOC LAN
Hola, Señor Cárdenas.

¿Hambre?

SEÑOR CÁRDENAS
Ay, sí, chinita. Gracias.
She places food from Paul’s stack on the old man’s lap.
SEÑOR CÁRDENAS (CONT’D)
God will repay you.
NGOC LAN
How’s your lung? How’s your lung?
SEÑOR CARDENAS
A little better today, gracias.
Ngoc Lan nods approvingly.
NGOC LAN
Okay over here next.
168

This way.

INT. ANOTHER APARTMENT - NIGHT
A MOTHER lifts her nine-year-old SON’s shirt to reveal red
circles on his chest and back. The woman’s HUSBAND looks on.
Ngoc Lan looks to Paul for a verdict.
PAUL
Ouch. Okay. That looks painful.
Mucho dolor, verdad?
Sí.

SON
MOTHER
I give him baths and scrub him and
put herbs, but nothing helps.
PAUL
I bet that’s ringworm. I don’t know
how to say that in Spanish.
(thinking)
Ringworm’s a fungus, so... No baño.
No baño. No agua. Seco. Seco.
(to Ngoc Lan)
Maybe I can find something at the
drugstore and bring it for him
tomorrow.

NGOC LAN
Yes, you bring.

That’s it, right?

Ready to go home?

NGOC LAN
Now we go church pray Jesus.

INT. PENTECOSTALIST CHURCH - NIGHT
PARISHIONERS sing a hymn. Some shake tambourines. Trying to
be a good sport, Paul stands next to Ngoc Lan, but he has
never been more out of his element.

microphone, his words distorted by a cheap amp. The faithful
sway back and forth, eyes closed, one hand raised, Ngoc Lan
among them.

INT. ALONDRA APARTMENTS - NIGHT
Paul carries Ngoc Lan piggy-back upstairs.
NGOC LAN
You come back tomorrow morning pick

CLOSE on a door and the sound of a familiar doorbell.
DUSAN (O.S.)
Okay, okay! I’m coming!
The door is opened by an unshaven, hungover Dusan, who looks
into camera and dissolves into laughter.
REVERSE ANGLE -- It’s Ngoc Lan and her cleaning crew, among
them a fully uniformed and humiliated Paul.
NGOC LAN
Good morning, Mr. Dusan.

INT. DUSAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
As the crew enter and disperse to clean up the post-party
mess, we see that Ngoc Lan now sports a PEG LEG.
Dusan puts his arm around Paul’s shoulder.
DUSAN
Answering phones was not dignified
enough for you, I see. Now you
progress to cleaning toilets. I love
you, Paul. I really love you. You
are such a funny guy.
Yeah.

PAUL
Hilarious.

DUSAN
Like I said, Paul, you are too much
nice guy and little bit pathetic

DUSAN (CONT'D)
Konrad, Konrad! You must come see
something! This is so fucking funny!
PAUL
It’s just until she gets a new foot.
DUSAN
And how long will that be?
PAUL
I don’t know. The doctor said a
month, maybe six weeks.
DUSAN
That’s an eternity.
PAUL
Meantime she’s stuck with a peg leg,
which is almost worse than nothing at
all. She’s waddling around like a
goddamned pirate!
NGOC LAN (O.S.)
Paul! No talk with Mr. Dusan!
go upstairs with Verónica!

Paul is trained to obey but hesitates under Dusan’s gaze.

Dusan and Konrad enter behind her.

DUSAN
Yes, please, Miss Tran, take
everything. Mr. Konrad and I are
leaving day after tomorrow and don’t

DUSAN
Yes, in a minute. First there’s
something very important to discuss.
NGOC LAN
(turning around)
Yes?
176

INT. DUSAN’S KITCHEN TABLE - DAY
The four have gathered for a talk around the table.
DUSAN
Listen, here is the situation. I
don’t know exactly what, but
something big -- very big -- is
happening at the original small
colony. You know, the one in Norway.
They want me to go there right away
with a very important delivery. Too
complicated to explain. Top secret
and very urgent. Most important they
are offering us very big money.
Very big.

KONRAD
DUSAN
This means we need extra help to
do this quickly and make them
happy. And I’m sorry to say, we
need the same excellent helper
who is currently helping you.
(pointing at Paul)
Him.
The room falls silent as Ngoc Lan lets this sink in.

176

96
PAUL
Yes, Ngoc Lan, I have to go to Norway
with these guys.
NGOC LAN
So... you say... Paul go with you
Norway?
DUSAN
Yes, that is the situation.
Emergency situation.
KONRAD
And deeply humanitarian.
Instead of arguing, Ngoc Lan remains subdued.
NGOC LAN
Paul, you want go Mr. Dusan Norway?
PAUL
That’s what I just said. I mean,
look, Ngoc Lan, I’ll still be able to
help one-hundred-percent when I get
home and when you get your new foot,
and -NGOC LAN
You leave Wednesday?
Yes.

PAUL
NGOC LAN
And how long you go?
Paul looks to the men for help.
KONRAD
At least ten days.

Maybe more.

Ngoc Lan performs mental calculations, then smiles.
NGOC LAN
Yes, okay, Norway.

I go Norway too.

DUSAN
No, no, no, not you.

Only Paul.

NGOC LAN
I go Norway too. Paul, you help me
during trip.

97
DUSAN
But you’re very busy here with
humanitarian activities of your own.
And your cleaning business.
NGOC LAN
Verónica and other ladies know every
place. They do for me, I pay them
good. No problem I go.
(cheery now)
Norway colony peoples invite me so
many time but I never go. Feel so,
so guilty. They so nice peoples.
What?

DUSAN
Who invited you?

NGOC LAN
When I hospital so long time after TV
box, people all over world send me
happy card, flower, candy, make me
feel good. So many letter. One
letter very special I never forget.
From Jorgen Asbjørnsen.
Tears well up in her eyes.

The men exchange panicked looks.

NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
Dr. Asbjørnsen she write me say he
feel so, so bad I suffer for his
fault. He say he painful, he never
think make small so bad for people.
Dr. Asbjørnsen letter make me feel
so better. I write letter too, say

EXT. KONRAD’S YACHT - DAY

Paul stands at the prow, the wind in his hair, Ngoc Lan beside
him.
Paul looks up at the wheel house, where Konrad is at the helm
chatting with Dusan. Then he looks down at Ngoc Lan’s PEG
LEG. It’s all so odd, so unexpected.
179

179

EXT. REAR DECK - SUNSET
From a distance, we see Paul, Ngoc Lan, Dusan and Konrad
dining together, enjoying the splendid view. Dusan clowns to
the delight of the others, and Ngoc Lan seems unusually
relaxed and happy.

INT. CABIN HALLWAY - NIGHT
Paul helps Ngoc Lan down the steps to the sleeping area, and
she opens the door to her cabin.
NGOC LAN
Good night, Paul. I’m sure you have
very much work to do with Dusan
Konrad. Very important job only you
can do.
Um, yeah.

PAUL

Good night. Sleep well.
Paul watches her go, surprised by sudden pangs of longing.

INT. PAUL’S CABIN - NIGHT

181

Paul awakens when the engine suddenly cuts, and the boat slows
to a stop. Voices and footsteps follow.
Paul rises to peer out his tiny porthole. In the moonlight he
makes out a SKIFF pulling alongside the yacht and TWO NEW
PASSENGERS helped off the skiff and onto the yacht.
182

EXT. KONRAD’S YACHT - DAY

182

An unshaven Paul emerges onto the deck and is about to head to
the wheelhouse when he notices -NGOC LAN and an ELDERLY MAN AND WOMAN
seated on the rear deck, conversing. The woman leans forward
to clasp one of Ngoc Lan's hands in empathy and consolation.
Paul makes his way astern.
NGOC LAN
Look, Paul. This Jorgen Asbjørnsen.
And her wife.
Upon meeting the Asbjørnsens again, we see that the years of
stress have not been kind.
PAUL
Oh, my God. Jorgen Asbjørnsen.
Hello. This is such an honor.
NGOC LAN
See, Paul? Jesus smile for me.
(to the Asbjørnsens)
I say Paul I want visit Norway only
meet you.
ANNE-HELENE
I’m Anne-Helene. Please, sit. Join
us. We’re watching the world go by.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
You’ve no idea how terribly griefstricken we were by Miss Tran’s case.

100
ANNE-HELENE
Yes. Jorgen has lost so much sleep
over all the abuses.
(to Ngoc Lan)
It’s such a pleasure to meet you at
last. I just can’t tell you.
A few moments of quiet as all take in the surroundings.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
It’s humbling, no? Nature is such a
patient sculptor -- grinding a tiny
bit each day slowly, slowly for
thousands of years to make such a
supremely beautiful thing.
(overcome with sadness)
What a waste. What a dreadful waste.
Dr. Asbjørnsen rises and shuffles away, muttering to himself
in Norwegian.
ANNE-HELENE
You’ll have to excuse Jorgen. These
past few days have been especially
hard. Such a big decision to make.
And so quickly. Normally when we
visit the Colony, we like to take the
train and spend a few days in Narvik.
But then the news came and, well,
here we are, suddenly imposing on
you. We scarcely had time to pack.
PAUL
I’m sorry, but what news?
ANNE-HELENE
Why, the methane release. In
Antarctica. You must know about the
methane.
PAUL
Sure... But that’s not new, right?

INT. GALLEY - DUSK
All aboard have gathered for dinner around a table and listen
intently to the great man in their midst.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
The Earth has already seen five
major extinctions, and now there
will be another. I didn’t want to
believe it, none of us did. But
there we were in Helsinki, big and
small -- climatologists, biologists,
physicists, demographers,
immunologists, 26 Nobel Prize
winners among us. We built all the
models, did all the math, and the
conclusion was consistent. Homo
Sapiens will soon vanish from the
Earth. The only question is when.
Some say 500 years. Some say sixty.
Now with the terrible spike in
methane release, it’s out of our
grasp. Regardless how the end will
come -- unbreathable air, impotable
water, incurable disease,
environmental catastrophe, nuclear
winter, likely a combination of them
all -- relatively soon the Earth
will indeed purge itself of human
life, and God knows how many other
species. It is now an actuarial
certainty.
His mind reeling, Paul looks at Ngoc Lan. She has been
listening quietly, but tears flow down her face.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
(pouring himself a drink)
Not a very successful species, these
Homo Sapiens, even with such great
intelligence. Barely 200 thousand
years. Alligator has survived 200
million years with a brain the size
of a walnut.
PAUL
Do you really mean extinction?
about downsizing?

What

DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Yeah, yeah, too little too late. Only
3% of the world has miniaturized.
There simply isn’t enough time. Yes,
extinction is exactly the correct word.

EXT. DECK - DUSK
Paul and Ngoc Lan lean against the railing, soothed by the
stars and the wind.
PAUL
People have been predicting the end
of the world for thousands of
years, and now it’s really
happening. I guess somebody had to
be right someday.
NGOC LAN
Very sad.

So sad.

They gaze at the moonlit landscape. The moment is ripe for
love. Ngoc Lan looks at Paul, hoping he’ll sense her need,
but he seems oblivious, and she starts to walk away.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
Sleep now. Good night, Paul.
PAUL
Good night, Ngoc Lan.
Surprised by her abrupt departure, Paul watches her go.
she pauses, emitting a barely audible grunt of pain.
You okay?
I fine.

Then

PAUL (CONT’D)
NGOC LAN
PAUL
Maybe I should take a look.
Okay.
185

NGOC LAN
Yes. You look.

INT. NGOC LAN'S CABIN - NIGHT
Ngoc Lan lies on the bed with one pant leg rolled up.
PAUL
Yeah, that peg’s making the socket
chafe a little.
Paul squeezes lotion into his palm and begins to massage the
tender skin of Ngoc Lan’s stump.

185

103
PAUL (CONT’D)
You know, if someone had told me five
years ago that one day I’d be four
inches tall, divorced, helping a
famous Vietnamese dissident get a new
foot, and cruising up a fjord in
Norway discussing the end of the
world with Jorgen Asbjørnsen, I would
have said he was crazy.
Paul notices she hasn’t been listening. Her eyes are closed,
and her head is tipped back. She moans slightly.
Paul stops massaging. Ngoc Lan opens her eyes just enough to
give him a look, then closes them again. Summoning his
courage, he lies down next to her and plants his lips on hers.
She’s stiff and unresponsive, so he stops.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. I thought...
such an idiot.

Jesus, I’m

Ngoc Lan opens her eyes and gives Paul a look at once fierce
and vulnerable.
No.

NGOC LAN
Please. I want.

Paul draws a deep breath, eases his way close again and gives
her a few gentle kisses. Ever so slowly, she reciprocates.
FADE OUT.
186

UNDER BLACK --

186

A STRANGE SOUND -- OOOOEEEEOOOOO.
EXT. KONRAD’S YACHT - MORNING
Zipping up parkas as they emerge onto the deck, Ngoc Lan and
Paul discover a different landscape. The walls of the fjord
are narrower, the terrain even lusher.
187

INT. WHEEL HOUSE - MORNING
As Paul and Ngoc Lan enter, Konrad and Dusan exchange a
knowing look. There are no secrets on a boat.
OOOEEEEOOOOOO!
PAUL
What’s that sound?

187

104
KONRAD
A greeting.
Konrad blasts the foghorn in response. When Ngoc Lan looks
away, Dusan gives Paul a wink and makes a crude gesture. Paul
responds with a glare that says, “Cool it.”

EXT. ISLAND IN THE FJORD - MORNING

A tiny BEARDED MAN in rustic clothing stands on a cliff
blowing into a lacquered SNAIL SHELL. OOOEEEEOOOOOO!
189

EXT. PORT - DAY

189

Motoring into a bay, the boat approaches a loading dock. A
few downsized fishing boats are moored in the harbor, their
prows carved into dragon heads as an homage to Viking
heritage.
No dwellings are in sight -- just the dock, two cargo cranes,
and a road leading away from port. HORSE-DRAWN CARTS with
DRIVERS await the yacht’s arrival.

Dusan stands with Paul and Ngoc Lan at the railing.

Harnessed horses pull a wooden cart up a steep series of
switchbacks. Paul, Ngoc Lan, Dusan and the Asbjørnsens ride
together in back. In the distance below, cranes unload the
yacht’s cargo.
192

EXT. CART - DAY

192

Ngoc Lan is staggered by the immediacy and immensity of nature
from a small perspective -- trees tall as mountains, leaves
broad as sails. Paul shares the feeling but even more
delights in watching Ngoc Lan.
NGOC LAN
I think never in my life I will see
some place so beautiful again.

105

EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
The cart crests a hill and pauses to enjoy the remarkable
view. A lush valley cradles a village surrounded by tiered
fields. Near the village are larger, more modern buildings.
ANNE-HELENE
All this land -- everything you see -belonged for centuries to the
Edvardsen family. It was Nellie
Edvardsen’s granddaughter Solveig who
arranged for us to use this place for
our settlement.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Solveig will remind you of this many
times.
Jorgen.

ANNE-HELENE
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
(with distaste)
Solveig.
PAUL
So that’s it. The colony. And
that’s the original dome. Wow.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
We use it now as a social hall and
fitness center, but yes, this is
where we started.
ANNE-HELENE
It was a wonderful time.
Jorgen?

Remember,

DR. ASBJØRNSEN
(wistful)
I remember.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
The cart passes through a gate and into the settlement, a
marriage between a traditional Scandinavian village and a
modern eco-commune.
The residents’ appearance suggests a life of communal values
and harmony with nature -- long hair, sandals, beards, ruddy
cheeks, rustic garments. ALL RACES are represented.

194

106
There’s a sense of urgency among the villagers as they bustle
about, but they’re not too busy to cheer the Asbjørnsens as
they pass. The couple respond humbly with smiles and waves.
CROWD
Papa Jorgen! Mama Anne-Helene!
195

195

EXT. THE SHED - DAY
The cart stops near a large, weathered SHED built into the
side of a hill. A small welcoming party of SCIENTISTS and
ENGINEERS greet the new arrivals.
SOLVEIG (O.S.)
Jorgen, Anne-Helene! Oh, thank God
you’ve arrived! Why didn’t anyone
tell me?

All turn to see SOLVEIG EDVARDSEN running toward them. A plussized Norwegian woman in her 60s, she’s hiking up the hem of
her long, flowing garments to avoid the mud.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
(smiling stiffly)
Solveig.
Solveig makes a big show of embracing the Asbjørnsens, drawing
them into her ample bosom.
SOLVEIG
I love you. I love you both so much.
Ever since the decision, I didn’t
feel right without you here. And you
know how I am when I worry. I can’t
eat. I can’t sleep. Ask anyone
here, they’ll tell you. My stomach
has been so upset, like I want to
throw up all the time, but can’t.
And I’ve had an awful headache that
just won’t go away. I know you know
about my headaches. I love you so
much. Thank God you’re here -- I
feel so much better now, like a big
release.
A FELLOW SCIENTIST comes to the rescue.
FELLOW SCIENTIST
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen, but we
need your advice immediately.
Yes, yes.

DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Excuse us, Solveig.

107
SOLVEIG
Of course, darling. You’ve got
important things to do. I love you.
You’re a genius.
ANNE-HELENE
(heading away too)
You look wonderful, Solveig.
Really?

SOLVEIG
I do? You really think so?

ANNE-HELENE
Wonderful.
SOLVEIG
(grateful)
Oh, honey.
Unplugged from the attention she craves, Solveig latches onto
the other new arrivals.
SOLVEIG (CONT’D)
Dusan, Dusan, dear Dusan. Bless
you for coming so quickly. I love
you.
DUSAN
(kissing her cheeks)
Solveig, my darling, I am always
happy to help -- in difficult times,
in easy times, in happy times. Is
always a pleasure to visit you and
your lovely village.
SOLVEIG
It is lovely, isn’t it? I can’t bear
to think I won’t see it again.
(to Paul and Ngoc Lan)
You know, I’m the one who made this
colony possible in the first place.
I’ve been coming since I was just a
baby. Papa used to fly us here every
summer in his float plane. I
remember one time -(to Paul)
Wait. I know you.
Me?

PAUL
SOLVEIG
(gripping his arm)
I’m sure of it.
(MORE)

108
SOLVEIG (CONT'D)
You were in my dream last night. I
was a little girl, and I was afraid
and lonely, but there you were,
walking beside me.
PAUL
Are you sure it was me?
we’ve never --

Because

SOLVEIG
You were a horse or a pony -something very strong -- and I
instantly felt better. Then I
mounted you and rode you through a
dangerous forest. And here you are.
Right before we leave. Another
miracle. You are coming with us,
aren’t you?
DUSAN
(jumping in)
Solveig, darling, listen, we love
you, but my friends and I are just
here for the delivery, and then we
must go home.
SOLVEIG
That’s really so sad.
if you’d join us.

We’d love it

PAUL
I’m sorry, did you say you’re
leaving?
Oh. Yes.
tell you?

SOLVEIG
All of us.

Didn’t anyone

PAUL
Where are you going?
Solveig points at the shed -- isn’t it obvious?
SOLVEIG
In there. Would you like to see?
(leading them, to Dusan)
You did remember my hand cream,
didn’t you? I couldn’t survive
without it.

INT. THE SHED - DAY
Solveig escorts the group inside. To Paul and Ngoc Lan's
surprise, they find that the rustic shelter conceals the
entrance to -A LARGE TUNNEL, disappearing into the mountain like a mine
shaft.
NGOC LAN
Where it go?
SOLVEIG
To China!
(giggling)
I’m sorry, forgive me. Sometimes I’m
so silly. No, to the vault.
PAUL
The vault?
SOLVEIG
Oh, yes. We’ve been working on it
almost since the very beginning.
Actually, not many people know this,
but it was my idea
DUSAN
Of course it was.
thinking ahead.

You’re always

SOLVEIG
When Jorgen made his big discovery, I
said, look, Jorgen, you’re a genius,
and downsizing is a genius idea. No
one’s questioning that. No one. But
what if people don’t accept it? What
if it doesn’t catch on in time? Look
at me -- you know, it took me years
before I did it. I had to sell my
antiques and find homes for my cats.
They’re very old and one of them is
diabetic, needs two shots every day.
It was a complete nightmare. Anyway,
this is what they came up with. On
my suggestion.
Solveig leads Ngoc Lan and Paul toward TORVALD, an engineer
seated at a control panel.
SOLVEIG (CONT’D)
Torvald, be a sweetheart and give our
friends a little tour.

110
TORVALD
The tunnel leads to a vault 1.6
kilometers inside the Earth’s
lithosphere and encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625.
Torvald points at an array of MONITORS displaying high-angle
views of streets, homes, farms and pastures.
TORVALD (CONT’D)
In addition to maintaining a broad
spectrum of biodiversity, the vault
is equipped with fields for growing
foods, forests for lumber, livestock
for animal husbandry. The
residential areas are spacious and
easily expandable to provide for
future generations.
PAUL
Wait, that’s not underground.
SOLVEIG
Of course it is! Our new size makes
it possible. Otherwise we never
could have dreamed of preserving so
much of the world in a single safe
place.
PAUL
This is brilliant.
(to Ngoc Lan)
Isn’t this brilliant?

Like Noah’s Ark.

SOLVEIG
That’s exactly what I told Jorgen.
It’s Noah’s Ark!
PAUL
What kind of power are you using,
nuclear?
TORVALD
No, no, 100% geothermal.
Interoperable organic systems
manage production of artificial
sunlight, oxygen, CO2 elimination,
water purification, and so forth.
As Paul soaks everything up, Ngoc Lan takes his hand.
PAUL
So how long will you stay down
there?

111
SOLVEIG
What is it, Torvald?
years?

Eight thousand

TORVALD
(lips pursed)
Something like that. Until the
surface environment stabilizes.
197

INT. COMMUNITY DINING HALL - NIGHT
All the villagers -- perhaps 250 -- dine together at long
wooden tables. Tonight the atmosphere is electric.
Paul and Ngoc Lan sit near the Asbjørnsens and other
SCIENTISTS who, between chews, dispassionately explain the
project at hand. Konrad and Dusan sit nearby.
ONE SCIENTIST
You know, it’s not unprecedented what
we are doing. Less than a hundred
thousand years ago humans experienced
a near-extinction. Maybe 2,000
survived. And from that handful came
all the billions of people you see
today.
ANOTHER SCIENTIST
Rebooting the species. Nothing new.
Glasses clink. Dr. Asbjørnsen rises. Never a comfortable
public speaker, he scans the faces turned his way.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
My friends. Many years ago, when we
discovered cellular miniaturization,
the world which had seemed so doomed
felt suddenly so full of
possibilities. We knew we had found
the portal to the next stage of man’s
evolution. So until very recently, I
maintained hope that the contingency
plan we embark upon tomorrow could
remain simply that -- a plan.
He pauses, reigning in his emotions.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT'D)
But history has spoken, and this is
our final dinner in the place we’ve
called home for so many years. And
here, on this beautiful little island

112
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT'D)
(noticing Solveig’s look)
-- this island which Solveig
Edvardsen had the vision and
generosity to provide us...
Solveig nods proudly.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
...the very survival of mankind rests
in our hands. Yes, we are sad to
leave, and terribly sad for the
reasons why, but man is too beautiful,
too improbable a life form to be
allowed to disappear forever from the
cosmos.
(Norwegian)
It is no shame to look into the warm
spring sun and regret a lost limb.
The Norwegians present nod and murmur in agreement.
uses the moment to hand Asbjørnsen a note.

Someone

DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Ah, yes. The kitchen staff wishes to
remind everyone that after you scrape
your plates, you should place them in
the stacking carts, not the dish
washing belts.
(clearing his throat)
Now then, I would like to ask the
surviving members of the original
colony to stand.
Twenty people solemnly rise. Most are in their fifties or
older, but among them we recognize one handsome young man.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
Look at him -- Little Ronni, how he’s
grown.
As Ronni smiles, we note a herpes sore on his upper lip.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN (CONT’D)
(addressing the originals)
I ask you again as I asked you so
many years ago. Generations to come - perhaps all of humanity -- will
thank you for your bravery and
commitment. But you must ask
yourself whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world. For there will
be no turning back. Are you ready?

113
LITTLE RONNI
I am ready!
Yes!

ORIGINAL COLONY MEMBERS
I am ready! Yes!

Tears and embraces throughout the room.
DR. ASBJØRNSEN
Is everyone ready?
Shouts of “I am ready!” coalesce into an ebullient group chant
of “We are ready.”
Konrad, Ngoc Lan and Dusan are moved to witness these
momentous proceedings, but Paul’s reaction is even more
profound. Something deep inside him is awakening.
198

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

198

Residents throw furniture into a BONFIRE. Drunken men sing
Viking songs. A hypnotic drum beat inspires dancing.
DUSAN
Konrad, what do you think? Is the end
of civilization really coming so
soon?
KONRAD
Look here. My uncle used to say he
was born during the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, then outlived both the Third
Reich and Communism, all three of
which were supposed to last forever.
In the 1930s they discovered a
pyramid in Egypt -- a pyramid! -when a camel stubbed its toe. How
does one lose a pyramid? Or look up
at the sky. So many of those bright,
bright stars went dark before humans
even existed -- we just don’t know it
yet. All things come to an end. Why
shouldn’t we? But look at the
positive side -- if our world really
is coming to an end, it’s fascinating
to be watching.
199

EXT. HILLSIDE ABOVE VILLAGE - NIGHT
Paul sits alone, deep in thought, looking down at the tunnel
entrance.

199

114
The shed has been dismantled, and work lights illuminate a
parade of carts heading inside loaded with supplies.
Ngoc Lan approaches, struggling up the hill.
NGOC LAN
Where you go? I look many place for
you.
PAUL
I’ve been here.
NGOC LAN
(sitting)
I talk with Dusan, he say fat lady
pay, he ready go back. I happy for
that. Too long time away from Señor
Cárdenas and Mrs. López. I worry too
much for them.
PAUL
Ngoc Lan, you can’t just be worried
about a few little people thousands
of miles away. You have to look at
the big picture.
NGOC LAN
Why you say like this?
PAUL
Because Mr. Cárdenas, Mrs. López,
they don’t stand a chance, none of us
do!
(gesturing)
All of this -- it’s over. Can’t
you see what’s going on? This is a
defining moment in human history.
More than that -- in the history of
the universe. And for some reason
you and I are here.
NGOC LAN
You want go with them.
PAUL
And I want you to come with me.
NGOC LAN
You crazy man! Always I know you
stupid. Now I see you crazy too.

115
PAUL
How am I crazy? You heard them.
This is the only chance for the
survival of our species -- that’s
huge! You want to help people?
These are the people you should be
helping. The future of humanity is
down that hole!
NGOC LAN
Who you help down there? People here
needs help, not down stupid hole!
200

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT
Ngoc Lan pulls Paul by the hand toward Dusan and Konrad, by
now quite drunk.
NGOC LAN
Dusan, Konrad, talk to crazy Paul.
He say he want go down hole, me go
with him.
DUSAN
Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul... Why would
you do such a silly thing?
Why not?

PAUL
DUSAN
Because you will live the rest of
your life in a hole in the ground.
Like a worm.
PAUL
These people are saving the human
race, and I want to help.
DUSAN
Okay, fine, you want to help. Then
do what I did -- give them a semen
sample.
KONRAD
I did, too. That’s a much more
pleasant way to help.
PAUL
If I’m not supposed to be a part of
this thing, then why am I here? I
look at my life and I... I’m a nobody.
(MORE)

200

116
PAUL (CONT'D)
But now I connect the dots and see
it’s all been leading me here. Why
didn’t I become a doctor? Why did I
downsize? Why did my wife abandon me?
Dusan, how did you just happen to be
my neighbor? Ngoc Lan, why were you
the only one to survive that box and
just happen to be cleaning Dusan’s
place that day? And if you hadn’t
lost your leg, I wouldn’t have tried
to help you -- which, as usual, I
screwed up. And why did I screw up?
So I could wind up here at exactly the
right time to go into that tunnel! I
finally have the chance to do
something that matters.
DUSAN
Paul, come on, you really are
talking crazy. These people,
they’re wonderful, but -KONRAD
It’s like a cult.
DUSAN
It’s like a cult. And the
extinction’s not happening for, you
know, maybe few hundred years. Has
nothing to do with you. Forget it.
Have a drink. Besides, you think they
won’t behave as people always behave?
They’re all going to go insane down
there and kill each other. They will
go extinct long before we do.
Paul searches the faces of his three friends, seeing them as
both allies and enemies. Then he turns and marches off into
the night. Ngoc Lan watches him go, her heart breaking.
DUSAN (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, darling. He said it
himself. Nothing he ever wants to
do works out.
201

EXT. FIELD OUTSIDE VILLAGE - DAY
The Bacchanal continues on a beautiful, sunny day. Around a
pond, villagers sunbathe, picnic and skinny dip. Others
siphon vodka from a bottle lying on its side.
Now dressed in “native” loose-fitting clothes and clogs, Paul
dances with a group near the drum circle.

PAUL
Beautiful day, huh? Knowing it’s the
last time I’ll see the real sun makes
it so... vibrant.
NGOC LAN
I ask you question. You say me
truth. Okay?
(he nods)
Other night on boat... what kind of
fuck you give me?
What?

PAUL
NGOC LAN
What kind of fuck you give me?
PAUL
What kind? I don’t... I have no idea
what you’re talking about.
NGOC LAN
American peoples, eight kind of
fuck.
(counting on fingers)
Love fuck, hate fuck, sex-only fuck,
break-up fuck, make-up fuck, buddy
fuck, drunk fuck, pity fuck.
PAUL
Look, I don’t know where you heard
that, but -NGOC LAN
Third host family.
PAUL
That’s just stupid. There’s a
whole spectrum of... emotions
and... motivations. And you
shouldn’t say “fuck.” It’s vulgar.
Say “make love” or something. I
don’t know.
NGOC LAN
So... was love fuck?
PAUL
No, I mean... What’s this all
about?

Paul

118
NGOC LAN
You look for me, you want help me,
you make fuck with me, now you go
down stupid hole. So I try to think
what kind fuck you give me. I think
maybe pity fuck. For leg.
PAUL
No, no, Ngoc Lan, I care about you
deeply. You are an extraordinary
human being, and I admire you so
much. More than anything I want
you to come with me.
NGOC LAN
Peoples always say me I strong.
Okay, maybe Vietnam I organize many
protest, survive two year prison and
punish me make small.
I only person
survive TV box, everybody die. I
walk around no foot, take care for
other peoples. But I woman.

PAUL
I’m sorry. I really am. It’s so
easy for me to see who you are. But
if I don’t do this, who am I? I
mean, really. Who am I?
NGOC LAN
You Paul Safranek.
Look!

You good man.

No

A WOMAN atop a rock sings a haunting Viking song of farewell.
SOLEMN FACES, many streaked by tears, are lit by the golden
setting sun. Among them we see the Asbjørnsens standing with
great dignity, and Solveig, sobbing a bit too loudly.

202

119
Despite wounded feelings, Ngoc Lan recognizes it’s the last
time she will see Paul, and she allows herself to slip her arm
around his waist. He places an arm over her shoulder.
The sun vanishes, its amber light now streaked by pinks,
greens and blues. Spontaneous applause. Now the residents
turn to walk slowly toward the tunnel.
203

203

EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
The departure nears completion. The last of the carts
disappear inside, the final residents following on foot.
Torvald waits nearby, preparing to seal the tunnel.
Ngoc Lan, Dusan, and Konrad stand with Paul.
PAUL
I guess this is it.
DUSAN
It seems so.
Konrad?

PAUL
Very nice to have met you.

KONRAD
Pleasure was mine.

Good luck in

Paul turns to Dusan and pulls him into a firm embrace.
DUSAN
Take care of yourself.
I will.

PAUL
You too.

DUSAN
I will miss my funny neighbor.
Paul nods, then turns to face Ngoc Lan. At a loss, he
tries hugging her, but she remains limp in his arms.
Ngoc Lan.

PAUL
She places something into his hands.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Your bible.
(off her nod)
But it’s in Vietnamese.

120
NGOC LAN
Words not matter. Remember me.
Paul leans in to kiss her, but she offers only her cheek. He
looks at the tunnel, then back at Ngoc Lan, her eyes downcast.
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
You go now.
Paul turns and heads resolutely toward the tunnel, clutching
the bible and dragging his wheelie suitcase.

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
Lit by lights strung along the walls, a stream of villagers
march silently and steadily toward their destiny.

At the rear, Paul walks with an erect, dignified bearing.
Nothing in his life approaches the magnitude of this moment. He
feels many things at once -- pride, fear, excitement, regret.
Soon the tunnel begins an incline, and Paul trots forward to
speak with a fit Nigerian guy named TUNDE.
PAUL
Excuse me. Why are we going up?

PAUL
And how long is the whole walk?
TUNDE
Eleven hours. Something like that.

See you down there. Stay hydrated.
Paul slows to a stop as the last villagers pass him by.
Suddenly he hears a SIREN and senses a flashing RED LIGHT.

EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
The door is nearly shut, when from behind it comes a muffled,
panicked cry.
WAIT!

PAUL (O.S.)
The door stops, then reopens slightly.

Paul squeezes out.

PAUL (CONT’D)
Thanks, Torvald. Thanks.
(jerking something)
My bag. Do you think you could --?
Leave it.
But --

TORVALD (O.S.)
PAUL
TORVALD (O.S.)
You need to get away from here!
PAUL
Okay, sure. Yeah.
Run!

TORVALD (O.S.)
Paul releases the bag and sprints away.
207

EXT. NEARBY HILL - NIGHT
Dusan, Konrad and Ngoc Lan have taken cover behind rocks.
Dusan peeks out and, breaking into a smile, invites the
others to witness Paul scrambling up the hill in a panicked
zig-zag.
DUSAN
What did I tell you? Nothing ever
works out for this guy.
Paul!

NGOC LAN
Paul spots his friends runs straight into Ngoc Lan's arms.

207

122
PAUL
(out of breath)
I was thinking about what you said,
and I... realized... you’re right.
I am Paul Safranek. And... what
you were asking... It was a love
fuck.
Ngoc Lan bursts into tears of happiness and embraces him
tightly.
KA-BOOM! An EXPLOSION above the tunnel entrance creates a
landslide which tumbles down to conceal it forever. Our
friends take cover, but they needn’t have -- it’s all small
scale, so the dirt falls pathetically.
Soon they emerge from behind the rocks.
NGOC LAN
Okay, now we go back Leisureland.
Okay, Dusan Konrad Paul? You
promise. Nothing more here. We go
now.
The three men stare at her, reminded once again what a
monomaniac she can be.

PAUL
Nervous?

CJ
Oh, a little skittish.
PAUL
I can understand that.
MELANIE
We got cold feet and almost
bailed out once or twice. But we
sure like the idea of buying our
first house. And starting a

right to stay big much longer. I

if we can.
CJ
Plus, you know, we didn’t want to
lose that deposit.
