You can’t begin to describe it. It’s just
so... it’s...

ADAM SCOTT speaks directly into the CAMERA.
I mean...

CUT TO:

KEVIN SMITH
Like nothing you’ve ever seen.
CUT TO:
LIZZY CAPLAN
Totally, impossibly terrible.
CUT TO:
IKE BARINHOLTZ
What the fuuuuuck?
CUT TO:
J.J. ABRAMS
To say it’s a “bad” movie is offensive to
other bad movies.
CUT TO:
ADAM SCOTT
The acting, the script, the green
screen...
CUT TO:
KRISTEN BELL
The sex scenes are particularly
upsetting.
CUT TO:
KEVIN SMITH
The thing... anyone can make a bad movie.
This is something else, something...
extraordinary.
CUT TO:
J.J. ABRAMS
It’s more than a movie. It’s an
experience, a triumph...

At least 50 times. Maybe more.

ADAM SCOTT
If I had a time machine, I would love to
go back and figure out, like, what the
hell was happening on that set? You
know...
AND WE CUT TO:
TITLES: “The Disaster Artist”
INT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO
TWO ACTORS are performing a scene on a small stage. One
of them is GREG SESTERO (19, blonde, California surfer
dude handsome).
SUPER: San Francisco, July 1998
MALE ACTING STUDENT
“Unless Godot comes.”
GREG
“And if he comes?”
MALE ACTING STUDENT
“We’ll be saved.”
Greg slowly takes off his hat. Looks at it. He’s “ACTING”
but not very confidently.
GREG
“Well. Shall we go?”
Greg’s performance is painfully flat. You’ve never seen a
more self-conscious actor.
MALE ACTING STUDENT
“Pull on your trousers.”
“What?”

GREG

MALE ACTING STUDENT
“Pull on your trousers.”
GREG
“You want me to pull off my trousers?”
A VOICE from the beyond calls:
JEAN SHELTON (O.S.)
STOP! Stop! Jesus. That was...

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 3

The voice belongs to legendary acting teacher JEAN
SHELTON (60s, small in stature, huge in every other way)
in the front row of the acting school.
JEAN SHELTON
Painfully unremarkable.
We see Greg visibly deflate. This hurts.
JEAN SHELTON
Rob, your breath control is all over the
place. And Greg...
Greg waits for it.
JEAN SHELTON
So scared and insecure. Like a wounded
puppy.
Greg sighs. Knows she’s right.
JEAN SHELTER
Do you even want to be an actor?
GREG
More than anything.
Jean just sighs, shakes her head. Greg and his Scene
Partner take their seats, Jean turns to the rest of the
class...
JEAN SHELTON
Who else? Who can show me they WANT this?
Anyone?
No takers. The room too afraid of her wrath at the
moment. And then:
I go.

VOICE FROM THE BACK

The whole room turns to the VOICE.
It belongs to a long-haired, muscle-toned, serious
looking MAN with a slight hunch and a creased face. He
wears black pants, a gaudy belt, dark sunglasses - equal
parts “Jack Sparrow” and “1980s Van Damme villain.”
For the first time, Greg is laying eyes on the man who
will change his life forever. This is TOMMY WISEAU.
Everyone watches as Tommy saunters slowly up to the
stage.
Focused, intense, he turns a chair around and straddles
it, getting into character.
JEAN SHELTON
And what is it you have for us Thomas?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 4

He looks up from the chair, pushing his dyed black locks
from his face.
TOMMY
It is Tommy. Not Thomas.
(beat, serious)
Never Thomas.
Shelton rolls her eyes. Whatever. She sits.
JEAN SHELTON
When you’re ready...
Greg, too, sits back, intrigued, as if knowing he’s about
to witness something unforgettable.
The man called Tommy looks up at the ceiling, channeling,
well, something. After a few beats, he begins.
TOMMY
Stella... Stella...?
Tommy’s accent is every bit as unusual as his fashion
sense. French, German, Eastern European - impossible to
tell. Tommy says “Stella” a few more times. Then he
stands. Starts wandering the stage like a lost kitten.
TOMMY
(louder)
STELLA!
Maybe Tommy hasn’t read the rest of the play. Or maybe he
doesn’t speak English. Anything is possible right now.
Greg sees some of his fellow students looking at one
another, trying to make sense of what they’re seeing.
Tommy doesn’t seem to notice or care.
TOMMY
STELLLLLAAAA!!!!!!!!!!
Tommy shouts it at the crowd. Then he shouts it at the
floor. That he shouts it at the chair. He kicks the
chair, causing even Jean (who’s seen everything) to jump
in her seat. Everyone is aghast.
And finally, at long last, he collapses, covering his
face with his hands. He starts to rock back and forth, as
if experiencing an epileptic fit.
Greg is amazed. The balls on this guy.
TOMMY
(one last shriek)
STELLA!!!!
(and then, quietly)
Don’t ever leave me baby.
He lays on the ground another long beat. Then it’s over.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 5

Tommy stands, runs his fingers through his hair, waits
for Jean Shelton’s response. (Everyone is waiting for
Jean Shelton’s response.)
JEAN SHELTON
Where to begin...
Someone in the crowd laughs, nervously. Jean puts her
hand up to silence that person.
JEAN SHELTON
I’ll ask you this, Tommy. What was it you
were trying to accomplish with that?
Tommy doesn’t understand the question.
TOMMY
I was performing the Tennessee Williams.
JEAN SHELTON
Yes but... what is your objective? What
does Stanley want?
TOMMY
He is... hysterical.
JEAN SHELTON
No, see, that is not an objective.
Objective means pursuit. You’re pursuing
someone, trying to reach them. You’re not
screaming because you’re sick or in pain TOMMY
Forgive me, but you’re wrong.
And that takes the whole room by surprise. Jean’s eyes go
wide. No one has ever spoken to her in this way. She
can’t believe it. In fact, no one can believe it.
TOMMY
See, I know this Stanley.
(resets the chair)
I show you again -Jean raises her hand.
JEAN SHELTON
I’ve seen enough, thank you.
Tommy shrugs, walks back to his seat. To Jean, as he
passes:
TOMMY
You don’t know the Stanley.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 6

Jean doesn’t know what to make of this person. Tommy
keeps walking, passing Greg as he does. Greg looks up at
him - awed. How can anyone have that confidence? And we
CUT TO:
EXT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
Tommy beating a hasty retreat. Greg races up to him.
Excuse me.

GREG

Tommy keeps walking.
Hey man.

GREG

It’s only this second attempt that Tommy realizes someone
is talking to him.
GREG
My name’s Greg. Greg Sestero.
Tommy looks Greg up and down. Who is this guy?
GREG
Would you want to do a scene together?
And on Tommy’s face, CUT TO:
EXT GREG’S SAN FRANCISCO HOME - DAY
Greg is having a FOOTBALL CATCH with a NEIGHBOR KID when
a white Mercedes, its windows tinted, pulls up. The
windows come down. Sure enough:
Get in.

TOMMY

Tommy is dressed in an elegant white shirt and tight
black skinny jeans.
GREG
Oh. I thought we were -TOMMY
I have to eat now. I get cranky little
bit when I don’t eat.
Greg hesitates. This is already super weird. Tommy
misreads.
TOMMY
Don’t worry, I pay.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 7

Greg thinks about it. Shrugs. Why not? Hops in the front.
He looks at the car’s interior. Brand new, all the
amenities. He wasn’t expecting this.
Nice car.

GREG

Tommy turns to him, intense.
TOMMY
Don't talk about me.
What?

GREG

TOMMY
What I drive. Where I go. You understand,
yes?
Greg does not. At all. But he doesn’t say so. He sees a
toy ROBOT CRAB wiggling on the dashboard.
TOMMY
And don’t look at robot crab. He’s shy.
And with that, the car pulls out and off they go. CUT TO:
INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
Packed at lunchtime. Tommy and Greg in a booth. Tommy
still has his sunglasses on. He flags a PERSON walking by
(who definitely isn't a waiter).
TOMMY
I need to order.
CONFUSED PERSON
I don't work here.
Guy walks on. Soon enough the WAITER appears. Before he
can even speak:
TOMMY
Pesto pasta, minestrone soup, and a cup
of hot water.
WAITER
Sorry, did you say “hot water?”
TOMMY
Why you give me hard time? Hot water,
yes. And more bread with raisin stuff.
The Waiter looks at Greg, wondering if he’s equally as
odd.
GREG
Just... coffee for me, thanks.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 8

The Waiter leaves.
TOMMY
Why you ask me here?
What?

GREG

TOMMY
Scene partners. You making joke?
No. I...

GREG

Greg tries to think of the right thing to say.
GREG
Look, the thing is... when I get up
there, in front of people, all I can
think about is, “what if they laugh at
me, what if I embarrass myself.” I’m not
in the moment. But you... I mean, shit
man, you’re amazing!
Tommy sits back, listening.
GREG
I figured I could learn a thing or two,
that’s all.
Tommy considers this. For a moment, we’re not sure if he
buys it. Then he takes out 2 copies of “The Lightning Rod
Man” by Melville.
TOMMY
Let’s do scene.
GREG
You mean here?
Greg is obviously intimidated by the crowd. Not Tommy.
TOMMY
So what? Yes.
GREG
There’s like... people trying to eat -TOMMY
Are you not dedicated actor? To be
dedicated, you have to rehearse.
Greg looks around at all the crowded DINERS.
TOMMY
I will play “The Lightning Rod Man.” You
play... this other man. With a Z.
GREG
Zechariah. Ok.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 9

Ok.

TOMMY

(beat, reads)
“Good day, sir.”
GREG
(quiet, embarrassed)
“Good day.”
Louder.
What?

TOMMY
GREG

TOMMY
Louder. Really project yourself. “GOOD
DAY, SIR!”
This draws the attention of some PATRONS. Greg turns to
them, self-conscious.
TOMMY
Forget them. There is only you and there
is only me. “I said, GOOD DAY SIR!”
Greg is a little hesitant but he takes a deep breath. And
he goes for it.
GREG
(reads)
“Have I, sir, the honor of a visit from
that illustrious god, Jupiter Tonans?”
Greg looks up. What the fuck is this play?
TOMMY
That’s good, keep going...
GREG
(getting more into it)
“So stood he in the Greek statue of old,
grasping the lightning-bolt.”
Tommy nods, encouraging.
GREG
“If you be he, or his viceroy, I have to
thank YOU - for this noble storm...”
Hey, it’s actually working for Greg. And we CUT TO:
EXT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
Greg and Tommy emerge. Greg feels great!

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 10

GREG
It’s like Brando says. “You have to feel
every performance right in your bones.
That’s how you know it’s right.”
TOMMY
Bridgitte Brando?
GREG
No. Marlon Brando.
(Tommy has no idea)
The Godfather? On the Waterfront?
Nothing.
GREG
He did that “Stella” speech in the
“Streetcar” movie.
TOMMY
Ah yes. I like this guy.
Greg looks at Tommy askew. Then he smiles.
GREG
Oh man, I’m gonna show you some things
that will blow your mind!
Tommy nods. A nice beat. Greg assumes the day is done.
GREG
So I'll see you in class?
TOMMY
You brought football, no? Let's play.
In that?

GREG

Tommy smiles wide and runs into the park. Greg shakes his
head. Nothing to do but follow. CUT TO:
EXT POLO FIELDS AT GOLDEN GATE PARK - LATER
Greg throws Tommy the ball. He bobbles and drops it.
TOMMY
My God, sun shine like hell today. This
park is no place for vampire.

What?

GREG
(weirded out)

TOMMY
(changing the subject)
You ever been to Los Angeles?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 11

Tommy picks up the ball and throws it back to Greg - a
wobbly sideways pass that never comes close to reaching
him.
GREG
Once. When I was little. Universal
Studios. Graumin’s Chinese. Sunset
Boulevard.
(beat)
Best two days of my life.
TOMMY
In Los Angeles, everyone want to be star.
All these pretty boys waiting for their
chance...
Greg throws the ball back. Again Tommy drops it.
GREG
Just have to get lucky, I guess.
And that angers Tommy.
No!

TOMMY

He gets in his face. Greg has no idea what’s happening.
TOMMY
You have to be the best.
Greg nods, ok. And then Tommy drop kicks the football,
sending it flying over Greg’s head.
Touchdown!

TOMMY

Greg laughs. Tommy does too. Enjoying themselves.
CUT TO:
INT THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - GUERRERO STREET CONDO - SAME
They approach the entrance to Tommy’s condo. Tommy takes
out a KEY RING with at least fifty keys on it. As he’s
about to open the door, he stops.
TOMMY
I must ask you again. Please don’t talk
about me. Not to class. Not to anyone.
Greg nods. After a stern beat, Tommy accepts this. Opens
the door. Greg follows him inside, no idea what to
expect.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 12

INT TOMMY’S CONDO - GUERRERO STREET - SAME
And it’s weird. PAPERS strewn everywhere, BOXES spilling
over with CASSETTE TAPES (each one labeled with a
different date), VIDEOTAPES, OFFICE EQUIPMENT, a BLUE
UNICORN statue in the corner next to a random SHOPPING
CART filled with empty PLASTIC BAGS.
TOMMY
The maid’s on vacation.
GREG
Cool, cool...
That explains it. Tommy walks into another room, leaving
Greg to continue exploring. On one wall are several
framed PORTRAITS OF TOMMY, on another is the AMERICAN
FLAG. In fact, there are American Flags all over.
GREG
So where you from, Tommy?
New Orleans.
Originally?

TOMMY (O.S.)
GREG

No response. Greg keeps exploring:
On one shelf are hand-crafted SCULPTURES of DISNEY
CHARACTERS, a SKELETOR MASK, and a vase of DEAD ROSES. On
another, BOOKS about acting and film. Greg sees a framed
poem, perhaps Tommy’s favorite, called “I Do Not Choose
to Be a Common Man.”
Greg sees a bunch of shopping bags scattered around the
room, all with a particular amateurish label on it.
“Street Fashions USA.”
Tommy re-enters with two glasses of water.
GREG
“Street Fashions USA?”
TOMMY
I do marketing, you know, retail stuff.
(off Greg’s surprise)
I am man of many skills.
Greg is impressed. And now Greg’s eyes fall on a
PHOTOGRAPH of a much younger Tommy standing in front of
the Eiffel Tower. It looks to be taken in the 1960s.
GREG
When was this taken?
TOMMY
Few years back.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 13

GREG
Wow, you look so young in it.
TOMMY
I’m not so old now, you know.
GREG
How old are you?
TOMMY
Don’t be smart guy ok?
A beat. Greg quickly changes the subject.
GREG
So... how’d you get into acting?
TOMMY
It’s always been dream. Long time. But I
ignore it. And then, one day, I have
accident. Guy runs red light and SMASH!
Very bad. Like wake up call you could
say. So I stop the other things, go back
to my dream.
Greg nods, understanding.
GREG
For me, everything changed with “Home
Alone.”
TOMMY
“Home Alone?” What is that? Movie?
GREG
Yeah, it’s... “Home Alone?”
Tommy has apparently never heard of it.
GREG
Anyway, it spoke to me, man. That movie
changed my life. Ever since then, I...
TOMMY
You want to be star.
GREG
I just want to be in movies. It’s what I
was born to do.
TOMMY
I understand.
(beat)
It’s your dream...
Greg nods. Finally someone who understands him. One day
with Tommy and he can feel his confidence growing.
CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 14

A MOVIE SCENE FROM “REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.”
JAMES DEAN as Jim Stark. He’s in the holding cell at the
precinct and his parents have come to bail him out.
JIM BACKUS
“Don’t I buy you every thing you want?”
JAMES DEAN
“Oh you buy me many things...”
JIM BACKUS
“We give you love and affection don’t we?
Then what is it?!”
REVEAL we are:
INT TOMMY’S APARTMENT- ANOTHER NIGHT
Greg is showing Tommy “Rebel Without a Cause.” Tommy
watches with rapt attention.
BACK ON TV SCREEN, Dean’s Parents continue to argue with
one another, until finally, Dean just can’t take it any
more:
JAMES DEAN
(shouting)
“YOU’RE TEARING ME APART!”
Tommy slaps Greg on the arm - you see that?! Greg smiles.
Tommy, enraptured, leans forward in his chair, studying
every inflection and mannerism of Dean’s performance. His
idol.
INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER THAT NIGHT
Tommy and Greg are buzzing from the brilliance of the
film.
TOMMY
He is emotion! Moment to moment. Not
plastic.
GREG
I thought you would like that.
TOMMY
The way he speaks. Style. He has that
signature thing.
GREG
Yeah it’s called being James Dean.
TOMMY
You can be like Dean.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 15

Me?

GREG

TOMMY
My God you are behind the schedule!
Listen to me, young man... you have the
gift, you have the look. Now you watch
the Dean. Very close. And you learn.
Greg takes that in.
GREG
You really believe that?
TOMMY
I believe in you.
Greg is amazed at this. Tommy sees Greg as he wants to be
seen. As no one else sees him. It’s a powerful thing.
GREG
I believe in you too, Tommy. If I can
have a career in this business, so can
you -TOMMY
I don’t want career.
GREG
Oh. I thought -TOMMY
I want my own planet.
GREG
“Your own planet?”
TOMMY
Call it Tommy’s planet. Big lights, big
stores, big events... spectacular.
Again, Greg wants to laugh at this but he can’t. Tommy’s
enthusiasm - his unbridled confidence - is overpowering.
TOMMY
And you can live there too if you want. I
let you stay for a while.
Thanks.

GREG

Greg laughs at this. Tommy smiles. Holds Greg’s gaze a
beat.
TOMMY
Here. I have present.
Tommy takes something out of his pocket. It’s a PEN with
the Street Fashions USA label. Tommy hands it to Greg
with great drama and meaning.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 16

Greg takes it. He looks at the other side of the label
and on it is the picture of an ORB. Written beneath the
orb, “Tommy’s Planet.” On Greg’s bewildered face, CUT TO:
EXT DINER - LATER
Greg and Tommy exit, back to talking about Dean and the
film.
GREG
... three movies and just like that he’s
dead. What a tragedy.
Tommy nods in agreement.
GREG
You know he died in Cholame, south of
here.
(beat)
I want to go one day. To the crash site.
Pay my respects -TOMMY
So let’s do it.
GREG
What, now? It’s like 300 miles away...
Tommy throws him his keys.
You drive.

TOMMY

And just like that, Greg and Tommy are taking a road
trip.
INT TOMMY'S CAR - LATER
Greg drives. He's mid-story...
GREG
... we had this talent show in middle
school and I was gonna sing it.
TOMMY
In front of everyone?
GREG
The whole school - parents, teachers,
everybody. I was so excited. Learned all
the words, practiced day and night -TOMMY
So you could win the contest?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 17

GREG
No. I was just excited to do it. My first
chance to perform in front of an
audience, you know. It was a pretty big
deal.
TOMMY
Yeah, yeah, I get the picture...
GREG
So the day before the show I’m in my
room, I take a break from singing to go
down, get some orange juice. And as I’m
walking down I hear my parents. They must
have thought I was still upstairs...
Greg recalls the painful memory. Tommy sees his face
change.
TOMMY
What did they say?
GREG
My Dad was all, “who told that kid he
could sing? He sounds terrible. He’s
gonna embarrass us in front of our
friends.”
Tommy absorbs that. Wow.
GREG
And my Mom, who usually stuck up for
me...
(shakes his head)
All she could say was “when he realizes
he’s terrible... maybe then he’ll grow
out of this shit.”
Greg stares straight ahead, remembering. It hurts him
still.
GREG
Next morning, they woke me up.
(beat)
I faked a stomach flu. Stayed home for
the day.
TOMMY
You missed the whole show?
Greg keeps driving.
GREG
To this day I’ve never had the guts to
sing in public...
A long beat of silence. Greg continues to drive.
Eventually:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 18

TOMMY
My god, Greg, what a story.
They drive in silence a few beats. And then:
TOMMY
“Aruba. Jamaica. Ooh I wanna take ya.”
Tommy gestures it’s Greg’s turn. Greg laughs. But then
sees Tommy is dead serious.
No.

GREG

TOMMY
“Bermuda. Bahama. Come on pretty mama...”
A beat. Tommy looks at Greg. Won’t take no for an answer.
Greg rolls his eyes.
TOMMY
“Key Largo. Montego...”
Until finally Greg, with a smile, joins in.
TOMMY/GREG
“Baaaay be why don’t we go down to
Kokomo.
Greg appreciates what Tommy wants to do for him.
TOMMY/GREG
“We’ll take it fast and then we’ll take
it slow...”
Tommy stops singing to allow Greg to finish alone.
GREG
“That’s where we wanna go...”
TOMMY/GREG
“Way down in Kokomo!”
And on the two of them belting it out unabashed, CUT TO:
EXT HIGHWAY 46 - LATER
Somber. The car is parked by the side of the road. Its
headlights on, illuminating the spot where James Dean
died.
TOMMY
I will miss him. Very much.
Greg nods. In the moment.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 19

GREG
His whole life he hears “you’re not good
enough, you’ll never make it - but he
doesn’t listen.
TOMMY
And he shows them all...
Greg nods.
TOMMY
That will be us, Greg.
Greg laughs. Then sees Tommy is serious.
TOMMY
We will show them all. You’ll see.
He becomes serious too.
TOMMY
Gimme your pinky.
What?

GREG

TOMMY
Pinky swear...
Tommy holds out his PINKY.
TOMMY
Right here, right now. We make a pact. To
push each other. Believe in each other.
To never lose sight of our dream.
Greg nods, he’s fired up. He locks his pinky with
Tommy’s. It’s a deal. CUT TO:
INT TOMMY’S CAR - LATER
LATER. Drive back, still awash in the euphoria of their
pact.
TOMMY
We should move to LA.
Yeah right.
Why not?

GREG
TOMMY

GREG
(shoots him a look)
Tommy, I can’t just go to LA.
TOMMY
Sure you can. Why can’t you?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 20

GREG
For one thing, I can’t afford it.
TOMMY
This not a problem. We stay at my place.
GREG
Wait, you have a place in LA?
TOMMY
I have apartment that I rarely use. We
can go there together.
(beat)
Roommates. Hahaha.
Greg can’t believe it.
GREG
Are you being serious right now?
TOMMY
Hey it’s up to you. I don’t force you.
Greg is speechless. But very intrigued.
TOMMY
You ever have roommate before?
(he shakes his head)
You’ll love it. Roommates the best.
Greg is deep in thought but he can’t help but smile, his
dream in reach. Tommy sees it.
TOMMY
I see you smiling babyface. This could be
great, no? The start of something very
special.
And we hear:
MRS. SESTERO (OVERLAP)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

INT SESTERO HOUSE - DAY
Greg is lugging suitcases towards the front door. His MOM
(50s, French, overworked) isn’t helping.
MRS. SESTERO
You can’t just pack up and move to LA.
It’s absurd. What are you gonna do for
money?
GREG
I have money saved from the modeling
jobs.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 21

MRS. SESTERO
That money will last you two weeks. Then
what?
GREG
I’ll... get a job or... I don’t know,
I’ll figure it out!
MRS. SESTERO
And this “Tommy” person... You barely
know this man and you’re moving in
together.
GREG
We’re not moving in together.
MRS. SESTERO
What does he want with you, hmm? Nothing
in life is for free Greg.
GREG
It’s... I’m just gonna stay at his place
for a while...
She shakes her head.
MRS. SESTERO
Do you know how hard it is? This acting
thing? You don’t just move to LA and
things happen. You have to be lucky. You
have to be talented...
Greg shoots her a look.
MRS. SESTERO
You know what I mean.
A beat.
MRS. SESTERO
I’ve tried so hard to protect you. You
walk out that door...
GREG
I know what I’m doing, ok, Mom.
Mrs. Sestero does not seem convinced. At which point, we
hear a HORN from outside. Greg looks through the window
to see Tommy pull up in his convertible. Greg smiles.
Mrs. Sestero gets her first good look at Tommy. Her eyes
open wide. CUT TO:
EXT SESTERO HOUSE - SAME
Greg makes his way towards the car lugging a SUITCASE.
SUPER: August 31, 1998

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 22

He throws one in the back. Goes back to get another. From
behind him comes Mrs. Sestero.
MRS. SESTERO
So you must be Tommy...
I am Tommy.

TOMMY

She holds his gaze a beat.
MRS. SESTERO
I need to ask you something Tommy because
I’m looking at your eyes and they’re
completely red. Are you on drugs?
TOMMY
Drugs? Ha ha ha.
Greg comes back out with another suitcase.
MRS. SESTERO
Perhaps you can tell me why you wish to
help my son?
TOMMY
Why, what is problem? Babyface is cool
guy.
MRS. SESTERO
(to Greg)
Babyface??
Greg shakes his head. Wishing Tommy didn’t say that. Mrs.
Sestero turns back to Tommy.
MRS. SESTERO
One more thing, Tommy, and this is
important.
(beat)
No sex. Do you hear me?
Mom, Jesus!

GREG

MRS. SESTERO
Are we clear, Tommy?
A beat. And then a smile comes over Tommy’s face.
TOMMY
Well, we all do...
And even Greg is weirded out by that.
Wait, what?

GREG

Tommy ignores this, looks at his watch.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 23

TOMMY
Greg, we really gotta go.
Mom looks at Greg. Greg kisses her on the cheek - he’s
going. Tears form in her eyes.
Greg takes a moment to glance back at his window where
his FATHER is watching him leave. He’s not coming out to
the car. An unspoken beat. Greg throws his last bag in
the back. Hops in.
MRS. SESTERO
Be safe, Mon Cherie.
Tommy puts the car into gear, perhaps forgetting he’s in
a convertible, he says to Greg:
TOMMY
My god, she’s crazy!
GREG
What does that mean, “We all do?!”
TOMMY
Figure of speech.
Greg lets that go. He takes one last look back at the
window where his father was and isn’t anymore. He’s
hoping he’s doing the right thing and truly believes that
he is. Time will tell. And we CUT TO:
EXT 405 HIGHWAY - LATER
A bird’s eye view of the car driving South.
INT TOMMY’S CAR - SAME
The guys in mid-conversation.
TOMMY
... not just vampire movie. All time
greatest vampire movie. I call it
“Vampire From Alcatraz: King of
Vampires.”
Wow.

GREG

TOMMY
You would see this movie?
GREG
Fuck yeah I would.
TOMMY
Of course you would. It would be
unforgettable movie. Based on truth.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 24

GREG
Wait, what do you mean “truth?”
Greg looks at Tommy, unsure if he’s serious. Tommy
smiles. Greg shakes his head - what a joker. Tommy
points.
TOMMY
See, we’re almost there.
Greg looks out the window. Los Angeles is getting closer.
His excitement builds. CUT TO:
INT TOMMY'S CAR - SAME
Driving through Hollywood.
TOMMY
Coming to LA is not easy, my friend. But
you take your time, you are only 16 now GREG
16? Yeah, no, I'm almost 21 -TOMMY
Eh, it’s all the same.
Greg isn’t sure what that means. They pass Graumin’s
Chinese Theatre where a PREMIERE is taking place: “RUSH
HOUR” with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. The red carpet,
flashbulbs popping. Both men inches from their dream.
GREG
It’s beautiful...
EXT FOUNTAIN AND SUNSET - HOLLYWOOD, CA - LATER
Tommy drives slowly down the street, talking to himself.
TOMMY
Is it this one? Wait, no, it must be... I
think this is wrong street.
Tommy takes a left. They continue driving, looking for
the place. Greg finds it very strange that Tommy can’t
find his own apartment. He keeps that to himself.
TOMMY
Ah yes. Here it is!
They pull into the entrance to apartment complex.
TOMMY
If anyone ask you are my cousin.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 25

Cool.

GREG

(beat)
Wait, why?
INT TOMMY'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
A nice apartment. Not much furniture. The only decoration
a Doors poster. Still, Greg is impressed.
Whoa...

GREG

TOMMY
It's not castle but I think it’s ok.
GREG
Are you kidding, it’s...
But then Greg notices there's only 1 bedroom. He is
suddenly very unsure about this situation.
GREG
...a one bedroom?
Tommy sees Greg’s face.
TOMMY
What’s problem? You don’t want to share a
bed with me?
A very long beat. Greg looks like he might shit himself.
Then, Tommy smiles...
TOMMY
C’mon, I’m joking. What do you think?
Greg laughs. Phew!
TOMMY
Check this out...
Tommy shows Greg a strange portion of the room has been
partitioned off with BLACK VELVET DRAPES.
What is it?

GREG

TOMMY
Second bedroom!
Greg looks to get a closer look. A red lamp. An air
mattress on the floor. Not very homey.
TOMMY
You can have the big bedroom.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 26

GREG
Are you sure? Tommy, I can... I can try
to find a cheap room somewhere...
TOMMY
No, Greg. I want you to be my guest. Like
in Beauty and the Beast.
(beat, smiles)
I’m beauty of course.
They both laugh.
TOMMY
You’re the beast.
Ok.

GREG

Greg throws his bag down on the bed.
GREG
Man, you’ve had this place this whole
time...?
TOMMY
Several years now.
GREG
How come you never moved down here
yourself? Made a real go of it or
something, you know?
Tommy takes a moment to think about this.
TOMMY
I never had a friend to do it with.
Greg takes that in. A nice beat between them. Tommy
smiles.
TOMMY
Wait, now I show you best part!
And Tommy runs out of the apartment, excited. Greg,
smiling, follows after him.
CUT TO:
EXT ROOFDECK - TOMMY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
The city lights twinkling at night. A stunning view.
GREG
It’s incredible.
They look out together for a beat.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 27

GREG
Tommy... thank you.
(beat)
I never would have done any of this if it
wasn’t for you.
TOMMY
You’re very welcome.
They turn back to the city lights down below. On top of
the world.
GREG
Holy shit, we’re doing this! We’re really
doing it! Woohoo!
Ha ha ha!

TOMMY

And on that note of unbridled optimism and excitement,
we, CUT TO:
INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING
Greg awakens. The bedroom door is open and it seems like
Tommy’s been gone a long time. Greg picks up an old copy
of Hollywood Reporter. He blows dust off the cover, opens
it, and we CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS - Those First Days in LA.
- Greg and Tommy (separately) driving down the stunning
tree lined streets of Beverly Hills. Expensive-looking
cars in expensive-looking driveways of even more
expensive-looking homes. Both of them smiling wide,
optimistic.
- They both drop head shots off at various agencies.
- Greg eats a burrito in Poquito Mas. At the next table,
another ASPIRING ACTOR is circling the trades. Greg
observes, makes a mental note of this.
- Tommy at an open casting call.
CASTING DIRECTOR
Do I hear an accent?
TOMMY
What? What you mean?
CUT TO:
INT IRIS BURTON AGENCY - LATER
Greg sits across from CHRIS (30, executive assistant).
Chris is studying Greg’s headshots.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 28

As he does, Greg’s eyes look at the client photos on the
walls: Jerry O'Connell, Hillary Duff, Josh Hartnett. He’s
sufficiently impressed.
CHRIS
These are great, actually.
Greg wasn’t expecting that. His eyes light up.
CHRIS
Do you have any tape?
And he deflates.
CHRIS
It’s ok. Not everyone does in the
beginning.
Greg smiles, relieved. Chris hits the intercom button.
CHRIS
Can you have Iris come back here a
moment?
Greg is over the moon. They wait a beat. And then she's
there, IRIS BURTON (60s, legit). She looks at Greg,
eyeing him up and down, silently judging.
IRIS
(beat)
Miramax would fellate this guy.
CHRIS
Paramount too.
Greg can’t believe how well this is going.
IRIS
You’re not meeting with anyone else, are
you?
(before he can answer)
Don’t. You’re all mine.
With one last intense look at Greg, Iris Burton marches
out. Greg looks from her back to Chris. And Chris just
says:
CHRIS
Welcome to the Iris Burton agency.
Greg can’t believe it!
CUT TO:
INT LAS PALMAS CLUB - SAME
The dancefloor is teeming with wannabe STARLETS grooving
to the music.

Tommy and Greg sit in a booth off to the side.
TOMMY
Tell me everything!
GREG
What do you mean?
TOMMY
The acting business. How to become big
star like you.
GREG
(laughs)
Big star. Tommy -TOMMY
But you’re on your way.
Greg thinks about that. It’s true...
TOMMY
I could learn from you. Teach me.
Tommy looks at him, all ears. Greg thinks about it.
GREG
OK, so, first off:
CUT TO:
INT PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY
High end. Fashionable. Expensive. And here’s Tommy posing
for the CAMERA, his shirt unbuttoned, his lips puckered,
his hair blowing in the breeze.
GREG (V.O.)
You’re gonna need some headshots. Good
ones. With lots of poses to show your
range.
TOMMY
I need more wind machine.
CUT TO:
EXT STREET - ANOTHER DAY
Tommy looking through the ridiculous HEADSHOTS. In one,
his shirt is unbuttoned, showing his bare chest, his hair
is pinned back. He looks like a SCARY WOMAN.
In another, Tommy’s hair is free-flowing and he’s making
a come hither look at the camera. Blue steel. Tommy is
pleased.

GREG
And you’re gonna need an agent. That’s
the hardest thing.
TOMMY
But you have one.
GREG
Well yeah, but...

So you’ll tell him about me...
Greg blinks twice but doesn’t answer.
CUT TO:
INT TOMMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Tommy is scouring “Backstage” magazine, circling open
casting calls he might be right for.
GREG (V.O.)
There’s something called “Backstage”

Tommy shakes his head. That is fucked up!
GREG
Eventually you book enough gigs to get
your SAG card.
TOMMY
SAG card. What is the SAG?
GREG
It’s the Actor’s Union.
TOMMY
How do I get into Union?
GREG
You can get in through a TV show,
commercials...
TOMMY
And once I have my SAG card, I am true
actor?
Yup.

GREG

Greg notices a PAIR of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN looking over at
them. He smiles, looks away. Tommy catches it. Sees what
Greg is looking at. Frowns. Before he can say anything
the Women have walked over.
WOMAN #1
(smiling at Greg)
We just wanted to come over and say hey.
GREG
(smiling back)
Hey. I'm Greg, this is Tommy.
Tommy glowers.
TOMMY
Ladies, do you mind, we're having a
conversation. What do you have to offer?
The Women are momentarily stunned.
TOMMY
I ask what you do - something besides
drink? Any job or anything?
(turns to Woman #2)
You - what do you offer besides taking
the vodka?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 32

The Women look at each other - is this guy for real?
WOMAN #2
Have a nice night.
(under her breath)
Losers.
The Women walk away. Greg winces in embarrassment.
TOMMY
Can you believe that?
Greg look at Tommy. No words.
LATER. Tommy on the dance floor - dancing his heart out,
oblivious to how people are avoiding him. Greg sits alone
in the booth as the WAITRESS comes by with more drinks.
WAITRESS
Vodka soda. And two hot waters...
Thanks.

GREG

Tommy tries to wave Greg over to dance with him. Greg
ignores him. Turns back to the Waitress.
WAITRESS
Your friend is... unique.
GREG
That’s for sure.
The Waitress takes a beat.
WAITRESS
Hey do I know you from somewhere?
GREG
I... Wow. Really.

Yeah I mean... I’m an actor.
WAITRESS
You’re always at that Poquito Mas off
Sunset.
GREG

Yes! That place is delicious.

Greg looks at her a beat. She’s really pretty.
GREG
Maybe next time, you should come say
hello.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 33

Or you could just call me. My name’s
Amber.
Greg.

GREG

ANGLE ON Tommy, dancing his heart out. He sees the
Waitress lean over and give Greg her phone number. This
bothers him for some reason. And on his face, CUT TO:

Enter Tommy in a huff.
Hi Greg.

TOMMY

And seeing Amber, he’s doubly annoyed.
GREG
Hey man! This is Amber I was telling you
about -TOMMY
I don’t have time for this. I must change
quickly and go.
GREG
Oh, ok. Is everything alright?
TOMMY
You’ve heard of Konstantin Stanislavsky?
GREG
Yeah of course. That’s Olivier’s teacher,
right?
TOMMY

AMBER
Pretty sure Stanislavsky is dead.
TOMMY
Impossible. I just speak to him.
Amber thinks about correcting him further - decides not
to.
TOMMY

one day you join.
Tommy goes in his room, shuts the door. Amber looks at

beater and a red bandana. Finally, he turns to the
audience.

“Let me NOT to the marriage OF true

This class is a lot bigger than the one in San Francisco.
Its students more varied in age and ethnicity. But
everyone in it is as puzzled as they were up North.
TOMMY
“Love is not love. Which alters when it
alternation finds.”
ANGLE on the TEACHER (50s, goateed, ponytail poking out
of his fedora). He’s horrified.
Stop.

The Teacher stands. Tommy picks himself up off the
ground.
TEACHER
What... exactly... are you doing?
TOMMY
Sonnet. You know sonnet?
TEACHER
Yes Tommy, I know what a sonnet is. I
guess what I’m asking is why on Earth
would you choose to do that today.
Tommy doesn’t understand the question.
TEACHER
Have you seen yourself? I mean, no
offense brother but look at you. You’re a
scary dude.
Tommy is very offended by this.

Look, I’m just gonna say it cause the
earlier you learn this the better.

Tommy looks like he might cry. He jumps down off the
platform, angry.

I am NOT villain.
He grabs his coat off the chair and storms out of the
room. The Teacher calls after him.

Greg comes in from his retail job.
Hey Tommy...

TOMMY
Greg! We must go out tonight! Maybe go
dancing or a movie. Have you seen this
“Talented Ripley Man?”
GREG
Oh, uh, no but... actually Amber and I
have this birthday party...
Tommy pretends he isn’t bothered. He’s not a great actor.
Greg feels bad.
GREG
Would you like to come with us?
EXT ROOFTOP BIRTHDAY PARTY - LATER
Amber and Greg enter with Tommy in tow. The place is
packed with people, streamers and balloons for decoration
that read “Happy Birthday!” Seeing Amber and Greg,
VARIOUS PARTYGOERS approach them warmly. Hugs and kisses
all around.
Tommy stands back, sunglasses on, distant. Like he’s
never seen a birthday party before.
AMBER
Oh, and this is Greg’s roommate Tommy.
TOMMY
I don’t like this place.
No more is said. Amber looks at everyone.
AMBER
Let’s have a drink!
LATER. While Greg and Amber seem to know everyone, Tommy
stands alone in the corner, next to a table of food. He
picks up a carrot, sniffs it, then puts it back.
Tommy is approached by HENRY, a friendly partygoer.
HENRY
Try the onion dip. I made it myself.
(beat)
I made all of this.
Tommy looks at the food. Then back at Henry. Suspicious,
Tommy takes a small taste.
TOMMY
It’s disgusting. I hate it.
Henry, insulted, turns and walks away.
HENRY
(under his breath)
Wow. People are so strange these days.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 38

Tommy ignores him. Alone, he spots Greg and Amber across
the room, sitting on the steps arm in arm.
She laughs at something he says and then kisses him. He
takes in this image a long beat.
Until it’s interrupted by the arriving CAKE. Everyone
sings “Happy Birthday” to someone. Tommy takes this as
his opportunity to slip out unseen. CUT TO:
INT TOMMY’S CAR - NIGHT
Tommy drives down Sunset towards Beverly Hills, his
loneliness more palpable than ever. He talks into his
Cassette Recorder.

... Just because you have blonde hair you
think you rule the world? No, it’s
pathetic.

notices.

Awkward silence. Greg starts looking around for Tommy.

gonna go find my friend -ACTOR FRIEND
You mean the weird guy with the long
hair? I saw him leave like an hour ago.
And this is news to Greg. CUT TO:
INT SPAGO - LATER THAT NIGHT
Tommy dines by himself at the exclusive LA eatery. Around
the room, everyone else is on a date or in a big group.
And then he recognizes SOMEONE (40s, dark suit, slick).
Movie Producer JASON HAMMER. Tommy puts down his fork,
stands and approaches this table.
TOMMY
Sorry to interrupt but you are the movie
producer Jason Hammer.
HAMMER
(not looking up, dismissive)
Nice to see you. Thank you.
Hammer shakes his hand, thinking that will be the end of
it. His two FEMALE GUESTS look on.
TOMMY
I am Tommy Wiseau.
Ok.

HAMMER

Tommy just stands there.
HAMMER
Can I help you, Tommy? We’re kind of in
the middle of something.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 40

TOMMY
(not taking hint)
I won't give you the bullshit, I have a
lot of talent and many great ideas.
Please...
From one of his pockets he pulls out a headshot. Hammer
resists, now clearly annoyed.
HAMMER
This isn't the time or the place.
TOMMY
So tell me time and place and I will meet
you.
Tommy waves the Headshot Hammer won’t take in his face.
HAMMER
Come on, man.
Other tables notice the commotion. Seeing this isn’t
working, Tommy decides to try something else.
TOMMY
“To be. Or not. To be. Is the question.”
Oh my god.

FEMALE GUEST #1

TOMMY
“Whether it is nobler in the mind. To
suffer the slings. And the arrows --”
The whole room now is watching this is total disbelief.
Security!

HAMMER

Tommy ignores them, soldiering on, his big chance.
TOMMY
“Or to take up the arms against the sea
of trouble..”
And now SECURITY has arrived. They grab Tommy. As he’s
being carted off:
TOMMY
Give me chance Mr. Hammer! One chance!
HAMMER
Yeah. I'll give you a call if we decide
to remake Swamp Thing.
Laughter from Hammer’s Guests. Tommy is enraged.
TOMMY
(bangs on the table)
You are a swamp thing, I am Tommy Wiseau!

EXT/ INT GREG AND TOMMY’S APARTMENT - SAME
Greg comes home and sees the front door is open. That’s
weird. He walks in.

GREG

No response. Greg looks around. No sign of Tommy
anywhere. And then he sees the door to the fire escape is
also ajar.
EXT GREG’S AND TOMMY’S APARTMENT - ROOFTOP - SAME
Greg climbs up to find Tommy, still dressed in last
night’s clothes, looking over the edge like he could
jump.

still streaked with tears.

GREG

TOMMY
Do you think I’m villain?
What?

GREG

Another beat.
TOMMY
This town... I know they don't want me.
They don't understand me. Maybe I don't
have what it takes.
Greg stands next to Tommy. He too has been feeling the
effects of all the rejection lately.
GREG
I know what you mean.
You do?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 42

GREG
Yeah man. Of course.
(beat)
My agent’s totally stopped taking my
calls. All I hear is “no,” all day, every
day. It’s been fucking hard.
Tommy nods.
TOMMY
Nobody like me. Nobody give me a chance,
my whole life...
Greg sighs. Both of them sit there a beat. Greg sees how
low Tommy is.
GREG
But we can’t give up.
Tommy doesn’t seem so sure.
GREG
Hey. Hey, look at me. When they told
James Dean he wasn't good enough, did he
listen to them?
This approach gets Tommy's attention.
GREG
Fuck that, no, he ignored them. And he
showed them all. And that's what we'll do
too.
Tommy thinks about that.
TOMMY
I just wish I knew how.
They stand there, together, a long beat.
GREG
Maybe we should make our own movie.
Isn’t that a wild idea... But then his face changes. The
wheels turning. Something occurs to him.
TOMMY
That great idea.
And we CUT TO:

A - Tommy draws the curtains for complete darkness.
We hear:

B - Tommy sets up a typewriter on a desk. He places his
copy of “Streetcar Named Desire” next to it.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Everybody’s happy, life is perfect.
Tommy calls out to Greg.
TOMMY
Greg! How long is movie script?!
C - Tommy paces around the room, talking into his

TOMMY
But then this girl, this beautiful
girl... she betray him.
D - Tommy sits before the typewriter, his fingers on the
keys, ready to write his masterpiece.
TOMMY (V.O.)
... Sleep with best friend. We call him
“Mark” - after Mark Damon. From “Talented

E - Tommy hanging upside down from his pull up bar,
working out his frustration.

So Johnny goes crazy. Decides to kill
himself in front of the world. Then they
see. He shows them all! Haha.
F - Tommy typing as furiously as one can with two

then a gutteral yell from behind the curtain.
GREG

He hears:

Tommy and Greg in a booth. Tommy throws a SCRIPT on the
table in front of Greg. On the cover page:

A beat. Greg has no idea what to say. On closer
examination, we see he’s grown a beard, filled out a
little.
SUPER: May 7, 2001 (Five Months Later)

So what do you say?
About what?

GREG

TOMMY
I’m gonna make this thing.

Wait a minute, what director? What star?
TOMMY
Who do you think? Me! I already tell you
this! You don’t listen?
Greg is in shock.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 45

TOMMY
It’s like you say - Hollywood rejects us,
we do it ourselves.
Greg’s eyes go wide. Excitement building.
Tommy puts the script back on the table.
TOMMY
Behold - “The Room.”
(beat)
No one has read it yet. And so today, you
will be first.
Tommy sits back, expecting Greg to read it in front of
him.
GREG
Oh you mean now?
TOMMY
You must prepare yourself physically and
emotionally.
Tommy sits back again, expectant. Greg has no choice but
to read. He opens it up to the first page. Tommy puts his
hand on it.
TOMMY
And remember... is copyrighted.
Greg nods. Tommy takes his hand away. Greg starts to
read.
SERIES OF SHOTS as Greg turns the pages. We see FLASHES
of the screenplay:
- “LISA: I am not a slave here, am I?”
- “TOMMY: Old man donkey lets me know today.”
- “LISA’S MOTHER: Get your pretty little buns in here,
Lisa.”
Greg is having a tough time making sense of the pages.
Tommy sees that on his face.
TOMMY
I apologize if some of it is over your
head.
GREG
Yeah, I think... That must be it.
Greg reads some more. Tommy watches him closely.
Eventually, Greg turns the last page. Tommy looks up, his
eyes pleading for compliments.
Well...?

TOMMY

A long beat.
GREG
I mean... it’s good.
Tommy nods, excited.
TOMMY
And of course you will play “Mark.”

Wait, the guy who stabs his friend in the
back and steals his girl -TOMMY
(grabs the script)
You don’t want to do it, fine. Maybe
Johnny Dapp is available...
GREG
No I want to do it. I do...
Tommy sits back in the chair, pleased. Greg looks at him,
still in disbelief.
GREG
You’re really gonna make this thing?
TOMMY
No, Greg. We’re gonna make this thing.
(beat)
Together.
Greg and Tommy lock eyes. They’re fucking doing this!
AND WE CUT TO:
INT BIRNS & SAWYER PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
One of Hollywood’s best known rental houses for
professional filmmakers. Equipment, stages, you name it,
they lease it.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 47

Sales rep PETER ANWAY leads Tommy and Greg across the
studio.
PETER
... every assortment of lenses and
cameras, both digital and film...
Tommy admires the equipment although it’s clear he
doesn’t know what any of it does.
PETER
You’ll notice we have top of the line
Arriflex lights...
Peter waves over BILL MEURER (60s) from his corner
office.
PETER
... and here’s the owner of our facility.
Bill Meurer, this is Tommy and Greg, the
guys I was telling you about.
BILL
(shakes their hands)
Pleasure to meet you and welcome. How
long is your shoot?
TOMMY
However long it takes.
Bill looks to Peter who silently signals “let it go.”
Terrific!

BILL

Peter keeps on smiling.
PETER
Well, like I said, you’ll find everything
you need here at Birns & Sawyer. Rentals
start at TOMMY
Not rent. Buy.
Everyone looks at Tommy, confused.
PETER
I’m sorry, you said - ?
TOMMY
I buy equipment. Yes.
PETER
Tommy, that’s... why would you do that,
you don’t have to -TOMMY
“The Room” is first class production. No
Mickey Mouse stuff.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 48

Bill and Peter exchange a glance.
BILL
Hey, customer’s always right, right? So,
uh, you looking to shoot 35 or HD?
Tommy clearly has no idea what that means.
TOMMY
I shoot both.
Peter and Bill are flabbergasted. Greg tries to be
helpful.
GREG
I think he’s asking if you want to shoot
on digital or film.
TOMMY
My ears work. I want to shoot with both
cameras.
BILL
But... you can’t do both.
Why not?

TOMMY

PETER
You would need twice the equipment, twice
the crew... They’re not even lit the same
-- It’s just not done.
TOMMY
So what you’re saying is... I will be
first.
PETER
What I’m saying is... NO ONE. WOULD EVER.
Do it.
TOMMY
Exactly.
(beat)
I am not no one. I am Wiseau.
Greg high fives Tommy. Bill and Peter are stunned. Who
are these guys? Peter is about to respond when Bill
intervenes.
BILL
Can you gentlemen give us a moment?
Bill and Peter step off to the side. We can’t hear what
they’re saying but they talk animatedly while keeping a
keen eye on Tommy and Greg. After a few more beats, Peter
and Bill return. Their attitude very different.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 49

PETER
So we talked about it. We’ll sell you all
the equipment you need. And we’ll give
you a reduced rate on everything if you
decide to shoot here.
TOMMY
Good. I like this spot.
Peter looks to Bill. They’re trying to contain
themselves.
PETER
Terrific! Sounds like we have a deal.
INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATER
Tommy fidgets, seemingly restless, as Peter introduces
RAPHAEL SMARDJA (30s, arty professional) and SANDY
SCHKLAIR (affably disheveled, a Selleck mustache and
hefty glasses).
PETER
This is Raphael, one of our most
experienced DPs.
Tommy looks at Greg.
GREG
(whispers to Tommy)
Director of Photography.
TOMMY
DP, yes, sure -PETER
...and Sandy Schklair, script supervisor
on how many -32.
32 shows!

SANDY
PETER

SANDY
I’m a director too. I’ve done several -Tommy seems very impatient.
TOMMY
Great, everyone hired. I need to get back
to -RAPHAEL
Wait, shouldn’t we discuss your vision
for the movie first?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 50

SANDY
(fingering the screenplay)
And I certainly have a couple thoughts
about this script -TOMMY
You leave thinking to me, my friends. Do
your jobs, everyone wins.
Sandy laughs but then sees Tommy is serious.
Oh.

SANDY

RAPHAEL
Do you have a line producer?
TOMMY
What’s a line producer?
Raphael looks at Sandy a beat.
TOMMY
Whatever it is, Greg can do it.
This is news to Greg.
Who’s Greg?

SANDY

Greg raises his hand, a little uncertain.
GREG
I’m Greg.
(beat)
I’m also playing “Mark.”
Raphael and Sandy look at Greg, confused. What the fuck
is happening? Greg just shrugs. Buckle up, gang.
SMASH CUT TO:
INSERT: BACKSTAGE MAGAZINE from May 2001.
QUICK ZOOM: the corner of the very last page. A small
advertisement reads, “OPEN CASTING CALL - MAJOR MOTION
PICTURE. SERIOUS ACTORS ONLY. NO AMATEUR STUFF.”
INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY
Filled with aspiring actors who, like Greg and Tommy, are
hoping this is the one, the big break.
INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - AUDITION ROOM - DAY
A long plastic table separates Tommy and Greg from the
ASPIRING ACTRESS.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 51

TOMMY
That will be all, thank you.
The Actress smiles politely and walks out the door. Tommy
immediately turns to Greg.
TOMMY
My God. You see that? That is not Lisa.
Lisa is All-American girl. Very
beautiful. Very sexy. Like Angelica
Jolie. Ugh, why is this so hard?!
Greg opens the door for the next aspirant, JESSIE (20s,
perky, girl next door).
GREG
Jessie Howard.
Jessie comes in, smiling, confident. This is someone who
has been on a lot of auditions. Nothing fazes her. Not
even Tommy who takes a long beat to creepily eye her up
and down. After which he just says:
TOMMY
You may begin.
A beat. Jessie turns to Greg.
JESSIE
Um... are there sides or...?
TOMMY
No one sees script until they absolutely
must.
JESSIE
Ah. Woody Allen-style.
TOMMY
Young lady, this is not cartoon. This is
serious movie. My god.
Jessie looks to Greg for help. Doesn’t get any. CUT TO:
A DIFFERENT ACTRESS...
ACTRESS #2
(beat)
Ok, um... can you at least tell me
something about the part?
TOMMY
The part is Lisa.
A THIRD ACTRESS...
ACTRESS #3
And is Lisa... good, bad, funny, sweet,
happy, angry --

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 52

She is Lisa.

TOMMY

BACK TO Jessie, who stands there, at a loss. Tommy is
getting annoyed.
TOMMY
Your Mom just die!
Excuse me?

JESSIE

TOMMY
It is called acting. I am asking you to
show me emotion!
Jessie looks to Greg again. Nope. Nothing weird here.
TOMMY
Your Mom just die. Go!
On Jessie’s face, pretty stunned, CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS - Different Actresses Trying Out for Lisa
ACTRESS #1
(fake crying)
I miss her so much.
CUT TO:
TOMMY
You just win lottery! Go!
ACTRESS #2
(beat)
Oh my god, I won! I won!
TOMMY
Now you get parking ticket.
ACTRESS #2
(beat, trying her best)
Dammit, no, not again!
CUT TO:
TOMMY
Your sister is lesbian.
My... what?

ACTRESS #3

LATER. A petite, bubbly, somewhat timid blonde auditions
for Tommy and Greg. This is JULIETTE DANIELLE.
TOMMY
Michelle is best friend of Lisa.
She waits for more instruction but Tommy says nothing.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 53

JULIETTE
So what am I supposed to do?
TOMMY
(like it’s obvious)
Be best friend.
CUT TO:
LATER. Greg in the hallway taping something to the wall.
Tommy emerges from one of the rooms.
TOMMY
I need you to find me a bed.
GREG
(confused)
Why? Are you tired?
LATER. Tommy and a YOUNG STARLET lie on a MATTRESS that
now sits in the middle of the audition room. Tommy
explains:
TOMMY
Lisa is great love of Johnny’s life.
MODEL/ACTRESS
And who’s playing Johnny?
I am.

TOMMY

MODEL/ACTRESS
(beat)
Yeah... I don’t think I’ll be able to
work this into my schedule. Nice meeting
you, though.
And she practically runs out of there.
GREG
You think the bed is a little much?
TOMMY
(smiling)
Don’t be jealous. Who’s next?!
INT POQUITO MAS - NIGHT
Amber and Greg sit at the counter.
GREG
Well we still don’t have a Lisa but I
think we’re ready.
AMBER
I gotta hand it to Tommy. He’s weird but
he comes though.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 54

Yeah.

GREG

Amber puts a WRAPPED GIFT on the table. Greg looks at
her. What’s this?
AMBER
I’m proud of you.
Greg unwraps the gift to reveal a KEY. He’s confused.
AMBER
This way you can come and go as you
please. No pressure or anything. I just
thought -GREG
I love it. Thank you.
They kiss. A nice moment.
CUT TO:
INT TOMMY’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING
Tommy in the Driver’s seat. Greg in the Passenger’s seat.
The car is parked in the alley outside the Studio. They
look at one another. It is time. And we CUT TO:
EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO - SAME
In SLO-MO, Tommy and Greg emerge from the car.
SUPER: June 12, 2002 - DAY 1
They walk through the alley to the soundstage. They
enter:
INT BIRNS & SAWYER SOUNDSTAGE - SAME
Which has been constructed to look exactly like the real
alley outside.
Sandy and Raphael stand by a DOLLY (with two different
kinds of CAMERAS on it). A CREW of Gaffers, Electricians,
Prop people and the like mill about. It’s a real movie
set.
Tommy surveys the scene. Claps his hands and yells:
TOMMY
Everyone, gather! Come here!

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 55

They do as instructed. We see the whole cast of “The
Room” including: Juliette (as “Michelle”), PHILIP (the
actor playing “Denny”), CAROLYN (the actress playing
“Lisa’s Mom”), DAN (playing ”Chris-R”) SCOTT HOLMES (as
“Mike”) and KYLE VOGT (”Peter”).
Tommy turns to a YOUNG KID holding a CAMCORDER.
TOMMY
Markus, you ready?
The Kid nods, points the Video Camera at Tommy, its red
light starts to blink.
TOMMY
Today is our top of the mountain day. The
day we begin the first steps of a great
journey. After today, who among us will
ever be the same?
Applause all around. Speech is a little over the top but
the cast is excited. They’re making a movie!
TOMMY
This play will work if the chemistry
between all the characters makes sense.
Human behavior and betrayal applies to
all of us. It exists within ourselves.
Now it’s getting a little weird. Even Greg isn’t sure
what he’s talking about. Markus continues to record the
whole thing as Tommy continues...
TOMMY
You love somebody. Do you? What is love?
You think you have everything, but you
don’t have anything.
The cast starts looking at one another. What is happening
right now? Tommy isn’t done.
TOMMY
You have to have hope and spirit. Be an
optimist. But can you handle all your
human behavior or other’s behavior? You
don’t want to be good, but great.
(beat)
THE ROOM!
More applause. Raphael and Sandy lock eyes. Holy shit.
TOMMY
One other thing...
Tommy points to a curtained-off area at the back of the
lot with a sign that reads “Director Only.” It’s a toilet
with a curtain for a door.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 56

TOMMY
This is private bathroom. Cost me many
dollars so is only for me. No one use it.
SANDY
You know there’s a bathroom, like, right
over there. With a door and everything...
TOMMY
(like Sandy is crazy)
This is real movie set.

Ok!

(WTF)

SANDY

After a beat:
TOMMY
Enough pet talk. Let’s make a movie!
INT ALLEY SET - LATER
Raphael sets up both the digital and film cameras with
his crew.
RAPHAEL
Ready first scene...
WE TRACK with Greg as passes the cameras on his way
towards the set.
Dan (playing the drug dealer Chris-R) paces incessantly,
practicing his intense over-the-top dialogue.
CHRIS-R
I want my FUCKING money, motherfucker!
Greg slaps him on the back, encouraging. He walks on,
sees Tommy standing with Philip (playing the man-child
”Denny”), “blocking” the scene.
TOMMY
So he play with basketball here. And then
you come in here. Demand the money.
Greg nods along in support. Until Sandy appears.
SANDY
Can I ask a question?
Tommy turns to Sandy. Annoyed by this intrusion.
SANDY
If Denny already bought the drugs, why
does Chris-R want the money now? What
kind of drug dealer doesn’t require up
front payment?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 57

Greg too finds this odd. Tommy is about to answer when:
PHILIP HALDIMAN
Also... can I just call him Chris instead
of Chris-R?
TOMMY
His name is Chris-R. You call him ChrisR.
PHILIP HALDIMAN
Yeah but why?
TOMMY
Cause he is gangster.
Philip looks at Greg. Can you help? But Greg and Tommy
are in lock step.
Gangster.

GREG

Tommy makes to move on but Philip stops him.
PHILIP HALDIMAN
Oh, uh, also how old am I supposed to be?
TOMMY
I don’t know. 15, 16...
Both Greg and Philip find that odd. (Philip is quite
clearly in mid 20s.) But maybe this isn’t the time to say
so...
Ok, sure...

PHILIP HALDIMAN

TOMMY
And don’t be Brando today. You will hurt
yourself.
Philip isn’t sure what that means. Raphael comes over.
RAPHAEL
Picture’s up...
Tommy walks over to the Camera(s). He nods to Greg, who
returns it. It’s really happening!
RAPHAEL
Roll sound. Roll camera...
Tommy closes his eyes, takes a second to appreciate this
moment. And then: A CAMERA ASSISTANT holds up the
CLAPPERBOARD.
Action!

TOMMY

We see the 1st Take through the CAMERA’S POV.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 58

“Hey Denny.”

“CHRIS-R”

“DENNY”
“Hey Chris-R, I’ve been looking for you.”
“CHRIS-R”
“Do you have my money?”
“DENNY”
“Your money is coming. It will be here in
a few minutes.”
“CHRIS-R”
(pulls gun, grabs Denny)
“I need my money!”
“DENNY”
“Just give me 5 minutes...”
They wrestle a few moments longer than they need to
until:
Cut!

TOMMY

(he approaches them)
I love it!
Greg does a fist pump. So proud.
Everyone else looks at each other like “what the fuck was
that?” Sandy approaches Tommy.
SANDY
Did you want to do another?
TOMMY
Why? That was perfect.
And off his face, we HEAR:
SANDY (OVERLAP)
And that’s a wrap on day one, everybody!
INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - NEXT DAY
Greg walks through the CREW, taking it all in. His
enthusiasm for being on a movie set still evident on his
face. This is the dream.
SUPER: DAY 4
He walks towards Tommy who is sitting in make-up,
studying his lines. AMY, the make-up artist, tries to do
her work while Tommy reads lines.
TOMMY
“Oh hi, Mark.”
(beat)
(MORE)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 59

TOMMY (CONT'D)
“Oh. Hi Mark!”
(beat)
“Oh hi! Mark.”
Tommy is about to make his screen debut and he’s nervous.
GREG
You’re always nervous for your on-screen
debut. You should have seen me, I almost
threw up.
Tommy looks at Greg, more annoyed than comforted.
GREG
You’re gonna do great, Tommy. I promise.
Just relax.
Sandy appears, pointing to his watch.
SANDY
Five minutes.
Tommy stands. Looks around the place. Can’t sit still.
TOMMY
Where is wardrobe?
He walks over to the clothing racks. No one seems to know
where the costume designer is.
TOMMY
Do I have to do everything myself?!
Tommy starts grabbing CLOTHES off the rack. Picks a SHIRT
and a SPORTS COAT that neither fit nor match. He tries
both on and likes what he sees.
SAFOWA, the Costume Designer, shows up in the nick of
time.
TOMMY
Where have you been?
SAFOWA
I just went to grab ties.
TOMMY
Well now I’m already dressed. You’re too
late.
Tommy looks around for more props. Safowa has no idea
what he’s doing. He grabs some SCRUNCHIES, LOTION
BOTTLES, HAIR GEL, and a wad of fake CASH. He stuffs all
of them in his pants pockets.
SAFOWA
You’re gonna film the scene with all
those things in your pockets?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 60

TOMMY
I keep my stuff sweetie.
He walks off towards the set.
SAFOWA
Can I at least take a picture for
continuity?
TOMMY
Continuity - is in your forehead.
And with that, he’s gone. Safowa turns to Greg.
SAFOWA
What does that mean?
SANDY (OVERLAP)
And... action!
INT ROOFTOP SET - MOMENTS LATER
The crew is set up to film an OUTHOUSE which will double
as the rooftop’s entry point. The door opens and Tommy as
“Johnny” comes out.
“JOHNNY”
“It is not...”
(beat)
Line!
SANDY
“True.” “It’s not true.”
Tommy holds up his hand in apology. Re-enters the
outhouse.
SANDY
Going again. And... action.
Tommy comes out again.
“JOHNNY”
“It’s not true. I...”
(beat)
Line!
Sandy looks at Greg. Then back to Tommy
SANDY
(flatly)
“It’s not true. I didn’t hit her. It’s
bullshit. I did not.”
Tommy nods, goes back into the outhouse.
SANDY
And... action!

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 61

From the POV of the CAMERA, we see Tommy come out:
“JOHNNY”
“It’s bullshit. I hit her, it’s
bullshit...”
Tommy keeps walking, until in fact he’s completely out of
frame. Sandy can’t believe it.
SANDY
Dammit! Cut!
(beat)
Tommy... your mark.
TOMMY
(pointing to Greg)
He’s Mark.
SANDY
No, your mark. Where you need to stand.
To be in the shot.
Tommy realizes his mistake. Goes back in. Sandy exhales.
Tommy comes back out, staring at his feet:
“JOHNNY”
“It’s not true...”
Look up!

SANDY

Tommy can’t look up and talk at the same time.
CUT TO:
INT ROOFTOP SET
SUPER: DAY 5
“JOHNNY”
“I did not hit her. I...”
(beat)

No one watching can believe this.

This time Tommy SMACKS HIS HEAD in the frame of the door.
TOMMY
OW!!! My god!
CUT TO:

The SLATE says “Take 32.”
SUPER: DAY 9
“JOHNNY”
“It’s not true. I did not hit her. It’s
bullshit. I did naaat.”
(beat, still looking down)
“Oh hi, Mark!”
Sandy looks towards Raphael. Good enough?
SANDY
And cut!
(in Raphael’s ear)
I get it now. This is a huge money
laundering scheme.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP: A CHECK made out to Sandy from “Wiseau Films”
(complete with its own GLOBE logo). REVEAL we are:
INT WELLS FARGO BANK - DAY
Sandy is cashing the check, fully expecting it to bounce.
TELLER
Anything else I can help you with?
SANDY
Really? That went through?
The Teller sees the confusion on Sandy’s face. He leans
in.
TELLER
This account... it’s a bottomless pit.
And Sandy can’t fucking believe it. CUT TO:
EXT APARTMENT POOL - DAY
Amber and Greg sit by the pool. Greg is reading from “The
Room” script, studying his lines. Amber looks over.
AMBER
So how’s shooting going?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 63

GREG
Um, you know...
She doesn’t know. And neither really does Greg. But he
wants to believe.
GREG
Good. I think. It’s coming together.
Amber nods.
AMBER
And Tommy? How’s he doing?
GREG
He’s... you know... he’s Tommy. He’s
trying hard but... I think he’s nervous.
He’s put a lot into this thing.
A beat. Amber smiles, can’t help herself.
AMBER
(in “Tommy voice”)
I am Tommy Wiseau. Great American film
director.
Greg laughs.
AMBER
(in “Tommy voice”)
This is movie for the ages. Classic
drama. Like the “Gone With Wind” or the
“Dance With Wolves...”
Greg finds this hilarious. They laugh together.
AMBER
Oh man, what are you gonna do if it’s
terrible?
GREG
What do you mean?
AMBER
I mean... isn’t this gonna be on your
IMDB page?
This thought hadn’t occurred to Greg until now. Greg
thinks about it.
GREG
It won’t be terrible.
Amber doesn’t say anything.
GREG
It’s gonna be great, you’ll see.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 64

Amber picks up the script. Starts to browse through it.
Greg sits back in the chair, thinking about what she
said. On his face, we CUT TO:
INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Decorated wall to wall with American flags and Christmas
decorations. Tommy is alone, watching some of the BEHIND
THE SCENES FOOTAGE that Markus has shot: Sandy and
Raphael in video village during one of Tommy’s
performances. We hear:
RAPHAEL (O.S.)
Is he gonna do that accent the whole
movie?
SANDY (O.S.)
Pretty sure that’s just how he talks.
Tommy watches this like a detective, making mental notes.
He’s interrupted by a KNOCK. It’s Juliette, the actress
playing ”Michelle.”
JULIETTE
May I come in?
She does, admiring all the office decorations.
JULIETTE
Christmas in June.

What?

TOMMY
(quickly turning off the TV)

JULIETTE
No, I mean, I like it. And the flags...
TOMMY
I am American. Just like you.
JULIETTE
Of course. Yeah...
TOMMY
So what is it? As you can see I’m very
busy....
She sits on a chair across from Tommy’s desk.
JULIETTE
Is it true you still haven’t found a
Lisa?
TOMMY
Why, do you know someone?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 65

JULIETTE
Well I was thinking... maybe I could do
it.
TOMMY
(beat, looks at her)
Young lady...
JULIETTE
I know, I know. I don’t have much
experience but... give me a chance. I
might surprise you.
Tommy looks at her as if regarding her for the first
time.
TOMMY
Lisa is aggressive. Passionate. Very
determined. Are you those things?
JULIETTE
I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.
Juliette stands, slowly moves closer to Tommy.
TOMMY
And you also must be ok with the kissing
stuff? There is lots of -As if on cue, she kisses Tommy! He’s surprised but
quickly returns it and an intense make out ensues. A few
beats later, Juliette breaks away. Shrugs. Exits. Leaving
a very thrown Tommy with much to think about.
My god.

TOMMY

GREG AS “MARK” (OVERLAP)
“Yeah man, you never know...”
INT ROOFTOP SET - LATER
And now the rest of that scene. Tommy sits in a chair,
Greg as “Mark” stands over him.
“MARK”
“People are pretty strange these days. I
used to know a girl she had a dozen guys.
One of them found out, beat her up so
bad, she ended up in the hospital.”
Which causes Tommy to laugh. No one can believe it.
SUPER: DAY 23
SANDY
Cut. Let’s, uh, try that again...
CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 66

“MARK”
“... she had a dozen guys. One of them
found out, beat her up so bad, she ended
up in the hospital.”
Tommy laughs at that again. Sandy and Raphael share
another glance. Holy shit!
Cut!

SANDY

Sandy walks over to Tommy.
What?

TOMMY

SANDY
The story he’s telling you - the one you,
yourself, wrote - it’s not a funny story,
Tommy.
CUT TO:
“MARK”
“... he beat her up so bad she ended up
in the hospital.”
Tommy laughs uproariously again.
“JOHNNY”
What a story, Mark!
Sandy looks at Raphael who just shakes his head. Let’s
just keep going. CUT TO:
EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - PARKING LOT - END OF DAY
Greg walks with Tommy.
GREG
Good news on the Lisa front. I know a
girl, a really good actress, just got
back in town -TOMMY
Juliette is playing Lisa.
GREG
No, Juliette is playing Michelle.
TOMMY
Not anymore. She show up one day, very
pushy, manipulative. Her competition is
vicious! Perfect for Lisa!
GREG
Tommy, I’m the line producer. You have to
tell me these things...

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 67

TOMMY
But I’m director.
GREG
I know, I just... I want this to be good.
TOMMY
It won’t be good.
(beat)
It will be GREAT.
And Greg wants to believe this. But still:
GREG
So who’s playing Michelle then?
Tommy didn’t think about that. Oh shit.
GREG
You’re kidding, right? She shoots
tomorrow!
EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
Greg walks ROBYN PARIS (20s, brunette, savvy) down to the
other end of the alley.
GREG
I’m sorry it’s so last minute. I know how
this looks.
ROBYN
It looks like I’m going to be murdered.
Is anyone else auditioning?
Tommy waits for them at the end of the alley in his
pirate/vampire outfit.
Hello.

TOMMY

Robyn smiles.
Hi there.

ROBYN

Tommy looks at her a beat.
TOMMY
Do you believe in love?
Sorry?

ROBYN

TOMMY
Are you willing to give up your mind,
soul, and body to inhabit Michelle?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 68

ROBYN
(beat)
I mean, yeah I think so -TOMMY
Great! You got the part!
On Robyn’s face, unsure how to feel. She turns to Greg.
GREG
Welcome to “The Room!”
INT EL COYOTE - LATER
Jam packed and loud. Tommy sits with Greg and Amber in a
small booth.
TOMMY
(to Waiter)
I said hot water. This is not hot. Why is
everything a problem these days?!
The Waiter scurries off. Awkward silence. Amber looks at
Greg. Sending him a message. Greg seems a little nervous.
GREG
So Tommy... the reason we, uh, brought
you here... We’ve been talking and...
(beat)
We want to move in together.
Tommy looks at them, confused.
TOMMY
That’s impossible. My place can’t handle
the three of us.
No that’s --

GREG

AMBER
Greg and I are moving in together.
What?
Why?

TOMMY
(to Greg)

GREG
We found this place in Studio City. One
bedroom. Nice little yard in the back.
A very long beat. Tommy sees Amber take Greg’s hand and
hold it. He fixates on that hand for a beat. Tries to
mask whatever darkness comes over him.
TOMMY
What about the movie?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 69

That confuses Greg.
GREG
What about it? I’ll be there Monday.
Tommy shakes his head, anger building.
GREG
Tommy, just cause I’m moving out, that
doesn’t mean -Tommy stands abruptly.
TOMMY
You don’t understand.
Tommy looks at them, stewing, furious. And walks out of
the restaurant in a huff. Greg looks at Amber. Uh-oh. CUT

Greg enters, having carried most of his STUFF out to the
car. One more thing left to do:
Tommy?

GREG

He walks into the BATHROOM where Tommy is shirtless,
staring at his body in the mirror.
GREG
Tommy, we’re leaving.
Tommy says nothing.
GREG
Can we at least talk about it?
Tommy continues to admire himself in the mirror. Greg
tries one more time.
GREG
Cause I feel like maybe we should -And then, without even turning:
TOMMY
Look at my arms. Not bad, yeah. Like big
strong kid...?
Greg is disappointed.
Yeah, man.
(beat)
I’ll see ya.

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 70

Tommy doesn’t even turn around. Greg walks out, a little
saddened.
And only then does Tommy turn, hurt and betrayed and
unable to hide it any longer.
INT BEDROOM SET - ANOTHER DAY
Juliette lies in bed, the covers closely tucked around
her naked body as her hair is touched up. Documentary
Markus films her close-up in the most pervy of ways.
SUPER: DAY 44
Juliette is clearly a little uncomfortable but she’s
making the best of it. Until:
Tommy steps onto set, wearing nothing but a sock on his
dick.
Instead of getting into bed he starts barking at the
crew:
TOMMY
You. We need more lights. And you, help
him. You - come too. Raphael!
RAPHAEL
What is it, Tommy?
TOMMY
This shot is very important. It must look
like “The Titanic.”
RAPHAEL
“The Titanic.”
Yes.

TOMMY

RAPHAEL
Trust me, it does.
Raphael walks off. As more crew gather around, Juliette
pulls the covers up higher. She looks to Greg - help me.
He approaches Tommy.
GREG
Tommy, can you (holds his script down to
cover Tommy’s junk)
Is this really necessary?
TOMMY
I have to show my ass or this movie won’t
sell.
SANDY
Well at least have a closed set.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 71

TOMMY
Closed set? Why? I want everyone to see
this.
(then, to Greg)
You especially.
Greg doesn’t know what that means. Meanwhile, Tommy gets
in bed. Juliette tenses up. Even Tommy can see that.
TOMMY
Brad Pitt did this in The Legends of the
Falls.
JULIETTE
Can we put some music on? You know, to
help the mood. Like maybe an Alicia Keys
song?
TOMMY
We are not here to promote other people’s
work.
(barks at crew)
OK everyone gather closer. And... action!
He kisses her and she tries her best to return the
passion. Tommy pulls down the sheet to expose her
breasts, but then he suddenly stops.
TOMMY
Cut, cut... this is no good.
Everyone is confused.
JULIETTE
What’s the problem?
Tommy points at Juliette’s shoulders.
TOMMY
We can’t have this on camera.
(snapping at Make-Up)
See all this stuff here... these pimples
and things.
He continues pointing at her body in front of everyone.
Juliette is horrified.
TOMMY
Here and here. And what is this?
Greg has rarely seen his friend so rude.
TOMMY
(still pointing)
Take this shit out. We can’t have this.
Juliette starts to cry.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 72

GREG
C’mon man, do you have to say it like
that?
TOMMY
This is American movie! It needs to be
sexy. She needs to be beautiful.
She grabs the bedsheet and runs off.
GREG
Can I talk to you?
Tommy, slightly annoyed, walks with Greg off to the side
away from the others.
Tommy...

GREG

TOMMY
I know. I’m a little hard on Juliette
sometimes.
GREG
It’s not just Juliette -TOMMY
You think Stanley Kubrick was nice to his
actors? Or Alfred Hitchcock?
Greg thinks about that.
TOMMY
Let me tell you something. In that book
you gave me, about the Hitchcock... there
is this movie called “Birds.”
GREG
Yeah, I’ve seen “The Birds.”
TOMMY
When they make this movie, Hitchcock
would terrorize his actors. Lock them in
rooms, throw birds at them, real birds!
Nasty stuff. They would cry everyday.
(beat)
That movie wins every award. Is Mr.
Hitchcock a bad man? No. He is great
director. The very word “director,” it
comes from the word “dictator.” I rest my
case.
And that strangely makes sense to Greg.
TOMMY
If anyone has reason to be upset, quite
frankly it’s me, you know. I give them
jobs. I give them salary. I’ve spent more
than five million dollars on this movie
so far --

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 73

GREG
Wait, seriously?
TOMMY
-- and no one is grateful! No one
respects my vision! I know what they say.
I can hear them. No one trusts me, Greg.
Not even you.
I trust you.
Do you?

GREG
TOMMY

And he does. Despite everything, he still does.
GREG
I wouldn’t still be here if I didn’t.
Tommy nods. Puts his hands on Greg’s shoulders. Walks
back out to the SET.
Juliette, ever the professional, is back in bed faking it
with Tommy. Tommy rolls off her, smiles.
TOMMY
Let’s do it again.
No one thinks they need another.
Take 15...

SANDY

Tommy begins to hump Juliet. Everyone watches. He seems
to be thrusting into her at a weird angle.
SANDY
He knows where her vagina is, right? Why
is he fucking her belly button?
Tommy rolls off her, smiles.
TOMMY
Cut... Reset. I want more passion.
RAPHAEL
No, fuck that!
Tommy is stunned by this outburst.
RAPHAEL
You embarrassed that girl in front of the
crew. Do it again you’re a dead man.
What?

TOMMY

RAPHAEL
You heard me.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 74

RAPHAEL
Ok then you’re fired.
What?!

RAPHAEL

Raphael wants to charge at him. Greg holds him back.
GREG
Hey, hey. Everybody cool out.
TOMMY
I hear what you say, your jokes -- you...
(to Sandy)
... and you...
(to the Actors)
... and you too. All of you!
SANDY
The hell are you talking about?
TOMMY
Where is Markus?!
Markus emerges from behind the scrim. Camcorder in hand.
He drops it for the moment.
TOMMY
No, keep filming. Always be filming.
(to the Crew)
This is Markus. I hire him for
documentary. “The Making of The Room.”
Since our 1st day he has been filming
behind the scenes. Every nasty comment,
every laugh - he sees it all. And then I
see it.
RAPHAEL
So what you’re saying is... you’ve been
spying on your own production.
TOMMY
That’s right!
RAPHAEL
That’s fucking crazy.
TOMMY
So now you know. The next comment, the
next one to laugh - I don’t care who you
are, you’ll be out on the street!
Everyone looks to one another, trying to remember what
terrible things they probably said behind Tommy’s back.
RAPHAEL
So am I fired or not?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 75

TOMMY
(beat)
I give you one more chance.
RAPHAEL
(unenthusiastic)
Terrific. Check the gate.
CREW MEMBER
Checking the gate!
Tommy storms off. Not even Greg knows what to do. Raphael
sees Markus’s camera up in his grill. With a threatening
look, Markus turns the camera somewhere else. CUT TO:
EXT AMBER'S APARTMENT - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT
Greg nursing a beer, contemplative. A few empties by his
side. Amber comes out, dressed for bed.
You ok?
(nods)
Long day.

AMBER
GREG

Production is clearly taking a toll on him. They both see
it.
AMBER
When this is over, let’s get out of here.
Take the money you made, start over
somewhere.
GREG
You mean leave LA?
AMBER
Why not? What’s so great about LA?
GREG
I’m an actor. I need to be here. And I
can’t leave now. Things are finally
starting to happen.
AMBER
You’re not talking about “The Room,” are
you?
(off his look)
Greg I read the script. That’s maybe the
worst thing anyone has ever written.
Ever.
GREG
It’s... unconventional, sure...

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 76

AMBER
No it’s bad. And every night you come
home, completely miserable, with a
different story of how fucked up
everything is on that set. Do you really
think this is gonna work out for you,
Greg?
GREG
Do you know how many movies had bad
scripts, troubled productions? Star Wars.
Jaws. Apocalypse Now. The Shining. And
every one of those turned out amazing.
AMBER
Well this won’t, Greg. This isn’t Jaws.
And Tommy isn’t Stanley Kubrick.
Greg is annoyed by this.
GREG
You don’t really know what you’re talking
about.
Amber looks at Greg. His devotion admirable but also
maybe a little pathetic. We can see in her face Greg’s
naivete may be losing its appeal.
AMBER
I hope you’re right.
We hear:
“CLAUDETTE” (OVERLAP)
“Everything goes wrong at once...”
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON TOMMY’S PRIVATE BATHROOM.
Raphael comes out. He looks both ways to make sure Tommy
didn’t see him. He totally just took a shit in there.
Mission accomplished.
CUT TO:
EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
Claudette and Juliette sit under the lights, sweating
bullets. They’ve seemingly been waiting a while.
SUPER: DAY 68
Greg and the Make-Up Artist fan them down as they
continue to rehearse.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 77

CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”
“Nobody wants to help me.”
(beat)
“And I’m dying.”
JULIETTE AS “LISA”
“You’re not dying.”
CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”
“I got the results of the tests back. I
definitely have breast cancer.”
There’s a commotion and they turn. Tommy has finally
shown up on set. Sandy looks at his watch.
SANDY
He’s here, everybody!
Tommy ignores him, heads towards Carolyn and Juliette.
Already in a stint.
CAROLYN
Tommy, does this come back?
What...?

TOMMY

CAROLYN
The breast cancer.
(beat)
It is twist.

TOMMY

CAROLYN
But it never comes back?
TOMMY
I don’t have time to explain script to
you. And what is this? Where is make up?
You look like you just went swimming in a
lake?
CLAUDETTE
It’s 100 degrees in here.
JULIETTE
Can we at least get some water?
TOMMY
Honey. Don’t forget. No one else in
Hollywood give you water.
Juliette reacts, furious. Even Greg is surprised by that.
CLAUDETTE
(to Greg)
Someone’s in a mood today.
Meanwhile, Raphael approaches Tommy.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 78

RAPHAEL
We need to cut the alley scene.
Impossible.

TOMMY

RAPHAEL
No, we have to. We’re already four hours
behind.
TOMMY
And who’s fault is that?
Raphael can’t believe it.
RAPHAEL
It’s your fault. You showed up three
hours late - again.
TOMMY
I’m the director.
Exactly.
Exactly.

RAPHAEL
TOMMY

Raphael just throws up his hands. Tommy keeps walking. He
turns to the crew, pointing to some kleig lights.
TOMMY
Why aren’t these on?
GREG
Tommy, it’s way too hot for -TOMMY
IT IS NOT TOO HOT. IT IS NOT TOO HOT
UNLESS I SAY IT’S HOT!
At which point, Carolyn, the elderly actress playing
Lisa’s Mom, FAINTS from dehydration. HOLY FUCK!
CUT TO:
EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
LATER. Carolyn has some bottled water and a towel. She’s
eating with Greg and the rest of the actors at a lunch
table.
CAROLYN
I’m just tired. I haven’t been sleeping
well recently. I’ll be fine...
Greg studies her a beat.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 79

GREG
Can I ask you something? Why do you do
it?
(off her look)
You’ve got a husband, grand-kids. You
live fifty miles out of town. And you’re
waking up at 5, driving all this way, for
what?
Carolyn smiles.
CAROLYN
We’re actors, Greg. For you, me, people
like us... even the worst day on a movie
set is better than the best day doing
anything else.
Greg and the rest of the actors think about that. She’s
absolutely right.
PHILIP HALDIMAN
(to Greg)
Can we ask you something? What’s his
deal?
Tommy?

GREG

SCOTT
Yeah like where’s he from?
JULIETTE
How’s he have all this money?
PHILIP HALDIMAN
And what’s the hell is this movie about?
You’re the only one who’s read all of
it...
Greg is about to respond. Robyn interrupts.
ROBYN
I have a theory.
(beat)
It’s autobiographical. Someone in his
life was a Denny - kid brother, someone
he looked out for or something. Someone
else was a Mark, the better looking
friend he was always jealous of...
Greg thinks about that. Robyn continues:
ROBYN
I’m sure there was a Michelle somewhere.
And a Mike.
They all think about it. It does make sense.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 80

JULIETTE
So then who is Lisa? Who broke his heart,
stabbed him in the back, ruined his life?
ROBYN
Pretty obvious to me...
(beat)
The universe.
Greg shakes his head.
GREG
Look, Tommy is Tommy. He’s a weird guy,
no question. But I’ll tell you this...
every time I underestimate him, every
time I think maybe he’s just out of his
mind... somehow, someway, Tommy always
comes through.
(beat)
You watch. This movie’s gonna make us all
famous.
That gets some laughs. Clearly none of them believe it.
INT CANTER’S - NIGHT
Greg and Amber are on their way out when Greg notices
someone waiting in the front of the restaurant. His eyes
bug out, holy shit. He leans in, conspiratorially:
GREG
Shh. Check it out.
He gestures with his head, not too subtly. Amber looks
and sure enough - it’s BRYAN CRANSTON .
AMBER
Hey I know him.
GREG
Yeah no shit, Malcolm in the Middle.
AMBER
No, I mean...
(shouts)
Bryan!
Greg’s mouth hits the floor.
BRYAN CRANSTON
Amber, how’s it going?!
AMBER
So good to see you! This is my boyfriend,
Greg.
Cranston puts out his hand. Greg shakes it, still in awe.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 81

AMBER
He’s also an actor.
BRYAN CRANSTON
Oh yeah? Anything I would have seen?
GREG
Um, no, I doubt it.
A beat of awkward silence. But Bryan’s a pro.
BRYAN CRANSTON
Are you working at the moment?
GREG
Actually, yeah, I’m... shooting this
movie...
BRYAN CRANSTON
A movie. Nice! Good for you, man.
GREG
But I’d love to do TV someday. Sitcoms,
drama, cop shows - I love all that stuff.
Bryan thinks about this.
BRYAN CRANSTON
Funny you should say that...
(beat)
There’s this scene we’re doing next week.
The boys go missing and Hal and Lois find
them in the woods. We need a lumberjack.
You think you could you do that?
Me?

GREG

BRYAN CRANSTON
Well you got that beard...
That’s...

GREG

Greg is momentarily taken aback.
GREG
Holy shit, I would love to. Next week,
did you say?
BRYAN CRANSTON
Tuesday and Wednesday.
GREG
Amazing! Yes. I’m not shooting next week
at all.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 82

AMBER
Wait, Greg.
(beat)
You think Tommy will be cool with this?
GREG
Why wouldn’t he?
Amber shoots him a look.
GREG
Tommy’s my friend. He’ll be happy for me.
Amber says nothing to that. Greg turns back to Cranston.
GREG
Do I have to do anything?
BRYAN CRANSTON
No, just bring that handsome face of
yours.
(beat)
Oh, and don’t shave. Really sells that
lumberjack look.
GREG
I can do that! Yes! Thank you.
BRYAN CRANSTON
My pleasure.
(to Amber)
Good to see you, Amber.
He hugs Amber goodbye and walks off. Greg and Amber stand
there a beat.
GREG
How do you know Bryan Cranston?!
Pilates.

AMBER

INT A DARK BEDROOM - SAME
Tommy, as serious as we’ve ever seen him, kneels down and
makes the sign of the cross. Then he slowly raises a GUN
to his mouth. For a moment we might think this is real
but then Tommy pulls the trigger. The prop makes a tiny
POP sound.
ANGLE ON GREG, watching with the crew. He sees Tommy fall
over, start flailing around on the floor. This goes for a
long while until he grabs Lisa’s RED DRESS from the
ground CUT!

SANDY (O.S.)

Tommy turns to him, shocked.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 83

TOMMY
Don’t cut! What are you doing? This is
real acting!
SANDY
Tommy, if you plan to writhe around you
should probably do it before you blow
your brains out, not after.
(beat)
I disagree.

TOMMY

Sandy couldn’t care less at this point.
RAPHAEL
Can you at least try to stay in the
frame?
TOMMY
That is your problem. And action!
This time Tommy runs around, trashing the room. Glassware
and picture frames go flying. He breaks a mirror. He
pulls out drawers. He grunts and moans throughout the
rampage. He nearly runs into Markus, the documentary kid,
filming from off to the side.
“Why? Why?!”

“JOHNNY”

Tommy writhes around on the floor until he grabs the red
dress... which he then repeatedly rubs on his crotch.
RAPHAEL
(whisper)
Is he... why is he...?
SANDY
(has to look away)
Oh Dear God...
BACK TO TOMMY. Who is very clearly masturbating with the
dress. Upon finishing, he then SNIFFS the soiled dress!
Eventually he picks up the gun...
“JOHNNY”
“God... forgive me!”
And pulls the trigger! He falls over and remains
motionless.
ANGLE ON the entire crew. Stunned silence. No one can
believe what they just saw.
And... cut?

SANDY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 84

Tommy sits up, brushes some lint off his pants. Greg
takes a deep breath. It’s time to ask Tommy for a favor.
He approaches him, anxiously.
GREG
Dude that was amazing!
TOMMY
You think so?
GREG
Totally. So raw and intense. You really
brought it, man. Seriously.
TOMMY
(sincere)
Thank you.
Tommy nods to him, is about to walk away.
GREG
Hey, uh, listen... I know it’s last
minute but, um...
TOMMY
What is it, Greg, I’m very busy?
GREG
Well, I know tomorrow is the big beard
shaving scene -TOMMY
I know the schedule.
GREG
So I was hoping we could move that scene
maybe to next week and I could have
tomorrow off...
TOMMY
(covers his face)
Why, are you sick?
No, I -

GREG

TOMMY
(immediately suspicious)
So why you need day off?
Greg isn’t sure he should tell him. Has no idea how he’ll
react. But he doesn’t want to lie.
GREG
You won’t believe this but... I landed a
small part on a tv show. Malcolm in the
Middle.
Tommy doesn’t like the sound of this at all.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 85

TOMMY
But you’re a movie actor now. Why you do
this?
GREG
It’s a big show. Great exposure. Could be
a real boost for my career.
Tommy considers for a beat. Blank poker face.
TOMMY
What do you have to do on this “Malcolm?”
GREG
I don’t know.
(re: beard)
Just have to show up with this I guess.
Tommy says nothing. Considering Greg’s words carefully.
GREG
Which is why I can’t shave tomorrow. But
if you move the schedule just a day or
two... it would really help me out.
Tommy thinks long and hard about it. And he makes a
decision:
TOMMY
I’m sorry, Greg. I can’t help you.
GREG
(stunned)
What, why?
TOMMY
Clean shaven Mark has grand entrance at
start of 3rd Act. This is important
scene.
GREG
I know it is. But... we can shoot it next
week, can’t we?
TOMMY
I’m afraid no. Is impossible.
Tommy...

GREG

TOMMY
I can’t give you special treatment, Greg.
It would not be not fair to the others.
Greg can’t believe it. By now everyone has stopped what
they’re doing to listen.
GREG
C’mon Tommy, Jesus. I’m asking for a
favor --

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 86

TOMMY
Another favor. All you do is ask favors.
Greg flinches at that.
TOMMY
I give you place to stay, I write part
for you, I make this whole movie, Greg,
for you and for me. And you still want
more favors.
And this hurts Greg. Friends don’t do this. But at the
same time, it’s kinda true.
TOMMY
I’m sorry but my answer is no. So you
must choose. You do TV show. Or you do
movie. Our movie.
Greg is furious. All eyes are on him. What will he
decide? CUT TO:
INT MAKE-UP TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER
Greg comes in to find Amber there. Her arms folded. Her
face unable to mask her disappointment.
AMBER
I don’t understand you.
Greg ignores her. Sits on the bed, distraught.
AMBER
That was your chance to get away from
this guy and you didn’t take it.
GREG
What am I supposed to do?
AMBER
Say no! Walk out! Tell him to fuck
himself!
I can’t...

GREG

AMBER
Yes you can. Of course you can. Why can’t
you?
GREG
Cause he’s... my friend -Amber sighs deeply. Shakes her head. And then she says:
AMBER
You’re so full of shit sometimes, you
know that?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 87

And now he turns to face her.
AMBER
This isn’t about loyalty, or friendship.
This is about fear.
Greg looks at her - what is she saying?
AMBER
Your biggest fear is that you’re bad at
this. That you’d go on to that Malcolm
set and people would laugh at you.
(beat)
But with Tommy around, that wouldn’t
happen. It would never happen. Cause
there’d always be somebody worse.
Greg doesn’t want to admit it but she’s making sense.
AMBER
Tommy isn’t your friend, Greg.
(beat)
He’s your excuse.
Greg looks away, unable to deny it. She squeezes his
shoulders, walks past him out of the trailer. He watches
her go and in that moment, he knows, he’s lost her. We
hear:
SFX: The BUZZ of ELECTRIC CLIPPERS. And we are:
INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - BATHROOM - DAY
Greg, demoralized beyond repair, is being shaved with a
straight razor by Amy. If that wasn’t bad enough, Tommy
is behind him, too close, watching every pass of the
razor.
TOMMY
Mmm. Slower. Do it slower.
Take your time.
And then it’s over. Amy lifts Greg’s head up so he can
see in the mirror. He looks in the mirror, a little
heartbroken. RACK FOCUS to Tommy, right behind him.
Cheshire grin and all, purposefully ruining his friend’s
life. CUT TO:
INT THE ROOM SET - LATER
Tommy, “Denny,” and the ACTOR playing “Peter” stand
around in tuxedos. Denny inexplicably has a football.
The DOORBELL rings. Denny opens it and in walks cleanshaven Greg. Everyone gasps. A “HUGE MOVIE MOMENT.”
“MARK”
“So... you like it?”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 88

“JOHNNY”
“You look like a babyface!”
ANGLE on Sandy who looks at Raphael who just shakes his
head.
“DENNY”
“So you guys wanna play football?”
“EVERYONE”
“Sure./Great.”
“PETER”
“I don’t think so.”
TOMMY
“Come on... Don’t be chicken. Cheep cheep
cheep cheep.”
And everyone joins in...
“EVERYONE”
“Cheep cheep cheep cheep.
And.. cut!

SANDY

Tommy turns to him.
TOMMY
Did we get it?
SANDY
Oh we got it.
No one can believe it. CUT TO:
EXT GREG AND AMBER’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER MORNING
Greg waits on a street corner for Tommy. A few moments
later a VAN pulls up.
SUPER: DAY 118
Tommy rolls down the window, excited.
Road trip!

TOMMY

Greg is noticeably less enthusiastic.
TOMMY
San Francisco here we come. Like the old
times.
Tommy notices Greg’s attitude.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 89

TOMMY
What’s the matter, you don’t seem
excited?
GREG
Let’s just finish this thing.
INT VAN - DAY
Greg rides with Tommy and a 3-MAN CREW we’ve never seen.
GREG
Who are these guys?
Tommy motions to TODD (20, green, fresh out of film
school).
TOMMY
That’s Todd. That’s... friend of Todd.
And that’s... other friend of Todd.
Greg is confused by this.
GREG
Where’s Sandy?
Tommy doesn’t want to answer.
GREG
Where’s Rafael?
TOMMY
It’s over for those guys.
GREG
You fired them?!
Tommy looks away.
TOMMY
Ah forget about them. We don’t need them,
we have Todds now.
Greg just shakes his head. What can he do?
GREG
So where are we going anyway...?
And now a big smile forms on Tommy’s face. Greg does NOT
like the look of that.
TOMMY
San Francisco baby!
Oh Christ.

GREG
CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 90

INT VAN - SAME
LATER. Driving on the 405 North. Tommy and Greg in the
back. Greg doesn’t engage, just stares out the window.
TOMMY
Somebody is sad today. Can you smile
little bit or is it end of the world?
A beat. Greg doesn’t want to talk about it with Tommy.
TOMMY
Is this about your lady friend?
GREG
I don’t want to talk about it.
But then a beat later.
GREG
We’ve hit a rough patch, I guess. I don’t
know. Maybe we just want different
things...
TOMMY
That’s too bad. I always like her...
A beat.
TOMMY
I have idea! Let’s do a whole scene in
San Francisco.
GREG
What, a new scene?
TOMMY
We can use this emotion!
GREG
I thought we were just shooting
exteriors.
Tommy excitedly grabs his LAPTOP and opens it.
TOMMY
Don’t worry about this.
(beat, starts to type)
So maybe we’re in coffee shop. Johnny and
Mark talking about life and women.
EXT FISHERMAN’S WHARF - EARLY MORNING
Packed with tourists and pricey real estate.
We made it.

TODD (O.C.)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 91

INT VAN - SAME
The van pulls up in front of a huge building. Greg looks
closer and sees a small sign above the entrance. It reads
“STREET FASHIONS USA.” Greg look at Tommy, shocked.
GREG
Do you own this building?
EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATER
The crew is walking back to the van.
TOMMY
The bridges, Alcatraz...
TODD
We got everything. The whole city.
Todd and his Assistant are about to hop in. Greg stops
Tommy.
GREG
I don’t understand. If you own this
building, why didn’t we just shoot here?
TOMMY
(beat)
Script called for green screen.
Which makes absolutely no sense. Greg is about to say so
when Tommy’s eyes fall on a FLOWER SHOP.
TOMMY
I have new idea!
Tommy crosses the street, oncoming traffic be damned.
Todd looks at his TWO ASSISTANTS. They shrug and follow.
EXT FLOWER SHOP - LATER
Scene over, Tommy comes back out on the sidewalk,
excited.
TOMMY
Maybe now we shoot scene at the zoo...
He walks ahead of Todd and his crew. Greg hangs back with
them. He hears:
TODD’S ASSISTANT
It’s almost like he doesn’t want to
finish the thing.
TODD
Well of course he doesn’t. When this
movie ends, what’s he gonna do with
himself?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 92

Greg absorbs that. On his face, as it lingers, CUT TO:
EXT POLO GROUNDS - ANOTHER DAY
The exact spot they played football years ago. Greg knows
it too. He look at Tommy, wondering the point of all
this.
TOMMY
Now we throw the ball around. Like first
time.
He shows Todd where to set up the camera. Then he throws
the football towards Greg. It bounces in the dirt before
him.
GREG
(picks up the ball)
Tommy, what are we doing here?
He tosses the ball back but Tommy drops it. Tommy picks
it up with a new idea.
TOMMY
Let’s do singing scene.
What?

GREG

TOMMY
Mark wants to sing the “Kokomo” but he’s
afraid. So Johnny help him.
GREG
Yeah I don’t think so...
TOMMY
Tell the story of your Dad.
Greg realizes Tommy is serious.
GREG
I’m not doing that, Tommy.
TOMMY
I must insist. Daddy thinks you embarrass
him, no one believes in you, you’re not
good enough -Greg quickly looks towards Todd, sees the camera is
rolling.
GREG
Come on, man, I told you that in
confidence. I told you that as a friend.
Greg throws the ball back to Tommy who drops it.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 93

TOMMY
Movies are emotion. You need to be real
for us.
GREG
Fuck you Tommy, no -TOMMY
Daddy hates you, Mommy thinks you’re a
loser...
I said NO!

GREG

Greg hurls the ball at Tommy. Hard.
TOMMY
Dammit Greg, why you throw this tricky
stuff?!
GREG
You want to be real for the camera, fine.
Tell me where you were born...
Tommy quickly looks at Todd, still filming. Then back to
Greg.
TOMMY
This is not part of scene.
Tommy throws the ball back. His discomfort visibly
growing.
GREG
Where are you from, Tommy?
TOMMY
I told you we don’t talk about this.
GREG
You want an easier one? Ok...
(beat)
Where’s the money come from?
Now Tommy is getting angry.
GREG
You don’t go from selling toy birds to
owning real estate on Lombard Street?
How’d you get so much money, huh? What
did you do?
Tommy throws the ball back, hoping the camera can’t tell
how angry he’s becoming.
GREG
Too personal. Ok. Forget that. Just tell
me this:
(beat)
How old are you?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 94

TOMMY
(a warning)
Greg...
GREG
You want to be real, let’s be real. What
year were you born? Cause there’s no
fucking way you’re in your -And now Tommy EXPLODES, running over to Greg and leaping
on top of him. Fists and kicks start flying, curses too,
as they roll around in the grass. Todd and the crew keep
filming.
GREG
I believed in you. I trusted you. And for
what?
Eventually Greg shoves Tommy off of him and gets up.
Looks down at him, hurt and angry.
TOMMY
I gave you everything!
GREG
You RUINED everything!
Greg shakes his head. Starts walking. Tommy calls out to
him.
Greg!

TOMMY

Greg ignores him. Keeps walking.
TOMMY
YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE!
GREG
I don’t owe you shit anymore.
Greg walks off. Nothing left between them now. He mutters
to himself.
GREG
And this movie better be awesome...
And with that he’s gone. Todd looks at Tommy still on the
ground, emotionally spent. A beat:
Can we cut?

TODD

Tommy looks over to him. He forgot the camera was rolling
still. And with that, principal photography on “The Room”
is over.
CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 95

INT POST-PRODUCTION FACILITY - EDITING SUITE
Greg sits with a gleeful Sandy and an exasperated ERICA
CHASE, editor of “The Room.” We HEAR but don’t SEE what
they’re watching.
"MARK" (O.S.)
(suddenly explodes)
"Leave your stupid comments in your
pocket!"
Greg is confused by what he’s seeing.
GREG
I don’t understand...
ERICA
Because it doesn’t make sense. Lisa says
she's "getting ready for the party
tonight." Then it's night and there's no
party. Then it's day and she's still
getting ready for the party!
SANDY
And that’s how Tommy wants it.
Greg looks at him. What? Sandy shrugs. Typical Tommy.
GREG
So is it terrible or just confusing...?
Erica looks at Sandy.
SANDY
As crazy as the last 6 months have been,
and as much as I want to strangle Tommy this still isn't the worst movie I've
ever made.
EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
Greg drives up the street. On the phone with a New Agent:
NEW AGENT (OVER)
You’re telling me you worked on this
thing for eight months and got nothing to
show for it?
GREG
Believe me, we’ll be much better off if
no one ever -Greg’s eyes notice a giant BILLBOARD in the Hollywood
skyline. To his utter shock, it’s an AD for THE ROOM:
Oh fuck.

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 96

Greg?

NEW AGENT (OVER)

GREG
I’ll call you back.
Greg pulls over to the side. He gets a better look at the
billboard. It’s one of TOMMY’S HEADSHOTS, his lips
pursed, his eyes droopy, his whole face angled low as if
looking down on the passing commuters. The tag line
reads: “CAN YOU REALLY TRUST ANYONE?”
At the bottom of the billboard is an RSVP HOTLINE.
Greg, curious, takes out his CELL, types in the number.
INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
Tommy sits at a desk in a wife-beater. He answers
excitedly:
TOMMY
I’m listening...
INT GREG’S CAR - SAME
Greg quickly hangs up. Disbelief.
INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
TOMMY
Hello? Hello?
No one is there. Tommy deflates. He hangs up the phone.
We see his place has been turned into the de facto
operation for all things “Room” publicity. Posters,
fliers, stickers, etc.
We stay with him a beat. This is his whole life now. With
no one else in it. He continues what he was doing which
is inserting professional-looking INVITATIONS into
ENVELOPES.
CUT TO:
INT LOBBY - GREG’S NEW APARTMENT - SAME
Greg opens the mailbox downstairs at his new place. He’s
got a stack of bills. One POSTCARD stands out in
particular.
ANGLE on the POSTCARD - “You & a Guest are Invited.” It’s
an invite to The Room Premiere - below which is a faux
review: “With the passion of Tenesse Willaims!”(sic) Entertainment Today.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 97

Greg looks at it. A beat. He throws it in the trash.
CUT TO:
INT COMMUNITY THEATER - DAY
Greg in a scene from Arthur Miller’s “Death of a
Salesman.” A smattering of people in the audience. Greg
tries not to be intimidated.
"BIFF"
"No! Nobody's hanging himself, Willy! I
ran down eleven flights with a pen in my
hand today. And suddenly I stopped, you
hear me? And in the middle of that office
building, do you hear this? I stopped in
the middle of that building and I saw the sky. I saw the things that I love in
this world. The work and the food and
time to sit and smoke. And I looked at
the pen and said to myself, what the hell
am I grabbing this for? Why am I trying
to become what I don't want to be? What
am I doing in an office, making a
contemptuous, begging fool of myself,
when all I want is out there, waiting for
me the minute I say I know who I am! Why
can't I say that, Willy?"
He’s doing his best. And he’s not afraid.
EXT COMMUNITY THEATER - LATER
Greg emerges, says goodbye to some of his fellow
performers, is about to walk to his car when he hears:
Babyface.

TOMMY (O.S.)

Greg turns. None too pleased to see Tommy.
GREG
You stalking me now?
TOMMY
You’re not so hard to find.
Behind Greg is a poster advertising the play - “Death of
a Salesman” starring William Devane and Greg Sestero,
their head shots prominently featured.
GREG
Did you watch the play?
TOMMY
Nah. You know I don’t like comedies.
Greg just shakes his head.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 98

TOMMY
So how’s Amber?
GREG
I don’t know.
(off Tommy’s surprise)
She moved to Austin. It didn’t work out.
TOMMY
I’m sorry to hear this.
GREG
That why you’re here?
No...

TOMMY

(beat)
You didn’t RSVP. To the premiere.
GREG
Yeah, I don’t think I can make it. Sorry.
Tommy says nothing. Greg is about to walk away. He turns
back to Tommy.
GREG
Are you sure you even want to do that? I
mean, maybe it’s best to just... bury the
thing.
TOMMY
Why would you say this?
GREG
I’ve seen some clips...
TOMMY
Oh you don’t know what you saw. I fire
three editors since then...
Greg shakes his head. Of course he did. He starts to walk
off but Tommy stops him.
TOMMY
We made a pact, remember. To never lose
sight of our dreams. And Friday night
they’re premiering a movie - our movie in a real live movie theatre...
Greg takes that in. In that respect Tommy makes a good
point. But still, he’s hesitant.
TOMMY
I know you don’t like me anymore. So
don’t do this for me. Do it for you.
You’ll finally get to see yourself on the
big screen.
(beat)
This was your dream too, Greg.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 99

And with that Tommy turns and walks away. CUT TO:
EXT GREG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Greg stands in the very same TUXEDO he wore in the film.
There’s a strange vibe in the air. Maybe not excitement,
exactly, but some charge of anticipation, energy.
After a beat, a LIMOUSINE pulls up outside his place.
There’s no mistaking its destination - “ROOM” POSTERS
have been taped on the doors. One of the doors opens and
out pops Tommy.
He gives Greg a big, exuberant bear hug. Greg doesn’t
return it. His guard still up.
TOMMY
Can you believe this?
Greg sighs. Part of him can’t believe he’s doing this.
As they hop in, Tommy hands Greg a “Room” POSTCARD. Greg
looks it over, doesn’t want it. Tries to hand it back.
TOMMY
It’s ok. I have boxes of these things.
INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
And Tommy meant that literally. He and Greg sit amongst
various boxes of Room propaganda.
GREG
You really pulled out all the stops
tonight.
TOMMY
Wait till you see.
(beat)
Oh. And I have surprise for you.
That’s worrisome. CUT TO:
EXT HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER
The limo driving down the street. It slows in front of
Grauman’s Chinese Theatre where a CROWD of people have
gathered to see “The Matrix: Reloaded.”
They turn to see Tommy, popping out of the sunroof. With
his strange voice and dark sunglasses, he could be a
villain from that movie. He yells to the crowd.
TOMMY
Don’t see that! Come see feature movie
premiere! Tonight: The Room! You’re all
invited!

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 100

Tommy starts throwing T-shirts and Postcards to the
crowd. And to anyone else on Hollywood Boulevard who have
no idea what to make of this crazy guy.
TOMMY
(to the DRIVER)
Ok, let’s go!
EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Spotlights. Red carpet. Velvet ropes. Fanfare. Exactly
what you’d expect at a big studio movie premiere.
Except not a lot of people waiting outside. “Chris-R” is
there with “Denny” and “Mike.” Juliette and Robyn stand
with Carolyn Minnott and her Salt of the Earth elderly
HUSBAND.
The limo pulls up in front. Tommy’s HIRED PHOTOGRAPHERS
begin to snap pictures in expectation of Tommy’s exit.
INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
Greg is about to open the door when a look comes over
Tommy.
TOMMY
(to the Driver)
Drive around the block again.
The Driver shoots him a confused look.
TOMMY
We need to build the anticipation.
Greg rolls his eyes. Typical Wiseau.
EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
The gathered guests are confused as the limo pulls away.
INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
It pulls up again. Tommy looks out the window. Still not
satisfied. They keep driving.
EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Watching the limo drive off again, Robyn announces:
ROBYN
Tommy Wiseau, ladies and gentlemen.
Which gets a big laugh from the Room-mates.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 101

After a few more beats, the limo pulls up again and this
time it stops. The Photographers look at one another,
shrug, start taking pictures.
INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
Tommy nods to Greg. It’s time. The door opens.
EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Greg emerges first. Everyone cheers and shouts for him.
And, hearing the cheers and shouts, Tommy quickly follows
after. He’s ecstatic to hear the cheers increase in
volume.
TOMMY
Hello everybody!
Tommy enthusiastically enters the theatre. Greg a lot
less so. He’s curious, sure, but he already can’t wait
for this to be over.
INT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
People have started taking their seats. The MIDDLE ROWS
have all been reserved for the CAST. Tommy waves to
anyone and everyone and takes an aisle seat. It’s
starting to dawn on Tommy - this is real, people are
about to watch his movie - and it’s beginning to make him
nervous.
Greg sits next to him. No idea really what to expect. The
lights dim.
A LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE steps up to the front, holding a
microphone.
LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE
If I can have your attention...
ANGLE on “Denny,” turning to give Tommy a big thumbs. It
doesn’t appear to calm Tommy’s nerves.
LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE
Please welcome the writer/ director/
producer/ and star of tonight’s...
(looking at his notes)
... “extravaganza.” Mr. Tommy Wizz, Wise,
Wisso?
Tommy stands amongst the cheers and catcalls of his
guests. He now looks fucking terrified. Sweat pours down
face and neck. His hands shake as he grabs the mic. He
looks out on the crowd - Juliette, Carolyn, Robyn, Sandy,
the whole cast.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 102

He looks at Greg. A long, long look at Greg. And then,
fighting back, tears, finally he speaks:
TOMMY
This is my movie. This is my life.
(beat)
I hope you learn something... And
discover yourself.
He makes the “hang-loose” sign above his head.
Be cool.

TOMMY

And with that, he walks back to his seat. Greg puts his
hand on Tommy’s shoulder and squeezes. No matter what the
movie is, Greg is legitimately proud of Tommy at this
moment. Tommy puts his hand on Greg’s hand in a gesture
of thanks.
TOMMY
I’m happy you’re here.
Greg nods. Not giving Tommy anything more than that.
The lights go down and everyone claps - the movie is
about to begin.
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: the LOGO for Wiseau Films. It gets
the requisite applause. Tommy raises his arms in the air.
His shining moment.
And then comes a SECOND LOGO for Wiseau Films. This is
met with confusion, mostly. Sandy rolls his eyes. Then
some polite applause.
And now comes the opening credits. Dramatic music over
random shots of San Francisco. More loud applause. Greg
just shakes his head - “wait.”
CREDITS END
“THE ROOM”
And out comes Tommy as “Johnny.” Here are his first
lines:
“JOHNNY”
“Hi babe!”
(singsong)
“I have something for youuu.”
“LISA”
“What is it?!”
“Lisa” excitedly tries to wrestle it from behind
“Johnny’s” back. Eventually he gives it to her. A box.
She opens it to reveal “sexy red lingerie.”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 103

ANGLE ON Greg, mortified.
BACK ON SCREEN: “Lisa” re-enters the room in the
lingerie. “Johnny” likes what he sees.
“JOHNNY”
“Wow you look so sexy, Lisa. I would do
anything for my girl.”
At which point, “Denny” enters the room. This is
apparently not weird at all.
“JOHNNY”
“Oh hi Denny.”
“DENNY”
(inappropriately ogling)
“Wow look at you!”
“JOHNNY”
“Anything for my princess.”
ANGLE ON Philip Haldiman. He just shrugs.
BACK ON SCREEN:
“THE ROOM”
“Denny” eats his apple downstairs while, upstairs, “Lisa”
and “Johnny” begin their foreplay. A few beats of this
and then “Denny,” surprising them both, joins in on the
fun!
ANGLE ON Amber. She looks at Greg. Wow. He doesn’t return
her gaze.
BACK ON SCREEN:
“JOHNNY”
“Denny, two’s great. But threes a crowd.”
Denny gets the message.
“Bye Denny.”

“JOHNNY”

And Denny leaves. The music changes to what Tommy thinks
is sultry and arousing. “Johnny” and “Lisa” begin to make
out.
ANGLE ON Juliette, hiding her face. Robyn puts her arm
around her. Enjoying themselves, not yet demoralized.
BACK ON SCREEN:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 104

“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” has sex with “Lisa” as only he can. In her belly
button.
ANGLE ON the Audience. Many now start trading crazy looks
like “what the hell are we watching?” Many others
fidgeting in their chairs. You can feel it growing.
Greg is obviously slinking down in his chair from
embarrassment.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON SCREEN
“THE ROOM” INT FLOWER SHOP
“Johnny” enters a Flower Shop.
FLORIST
“Can I help you?”
“JOHNNY”
“Yeah can I have a dozen red roses?”

“Oh hi Johnny. I didn’t know it was you.
Here you go.”
“JOHNNY”
“It’s me. How much is it?”
FLORIST
“It’ll be 18 dollars.”
“JOHNNY”
“Here you go. Keep the change.”
(he pets a DOG)
“Hi doggie!”
FLORIST
“Thanks. You’re my favorite customer.”
ANGLE ON the Audience. Uncomfortable fidgeting, several
members trying desperately not to laugh out loud.
Meanwhile, Tommy watches intently. Still reveling in his
masterpiece.
BACK ON SCREEN
“THE ROOM”
Lisa’s Mom “Claudette” across from “Lisa.”
“CLAUDETTE”
“Nobody wants to help me. And I’m dying.”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 105

“LISA”
“You’re not dying.”
“CLAUDETTE”
“I got the results of the tests back. I
definitely have breast cancer.”
ANGLE ON Carolyn and her HUSBAND. He squeezes her hand,
proud.
ANGLE ON SCREEN.
“THE ROOM”
And the movie’s most famous scene. “Johnny” and “Lisa”
having it out.
“JOHNNY”
“I could not go on without you Lisa.”
“LISA”
“You’re scaring me.”
“JOHNNY”
“I did not hit you. You’re lying!”
He takes a deep breath and, in his best James Dean
impression, shouts to the heavens:
“JOHNNY”
“YOU’RE TEARING ME APART LISA!”
ANGLE on the Audience. The tittering a little louder now.
A few audience members now outwardly laughing...
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON SCREEN
“THE ROOM”
“Chris-R” threatens to kill “Denny” before “Johnny” and
“Mark” show up to rescue him. And then, just as quickly,
“Lisa” and “Claudette” are there too.
“DENNY”
“I owe him some money.”
“LISA”
“What kind of money?”
ANGLE ON ROBYN, she laughs out loud at this line.
“CLAUDETTE”
“What do you need money for?”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 106

“LISA”
(to Her Mom)
“Mom please! Denny is with me and
Johnny.”
Which gets more laughs from the crowd. The laughs are
growing in volume. Audience members getting more and more
comfortable laughing at this piece of shit. Even Juliette
is now enjoying herself.
ANGLE ON Greg, not expecting this. He too looks like he
might join in the fun. But he turns towards Tommy -ANGLE ON TOMMY, starting to realize this isn’t turning
out how he expected. Greg sees it on Tommy’s face - it’s
like he’s been punched in the gut.
This is not good...
ANGLE ON SCREEN
“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” and “Mark” on the rooftop. We saw this one being
filmed earlier but cut together, it’s even more
incredible.
“JOHNNY”
“It’s not true. I did not hit her. It’s
bullshit. I did not hit her. I did
naaht.”
(beat)
“Oh hi Mark.”
Everyone has by now lost their collective shit. They hoot
and holler, genuinely having fun at the ridiculousness.
Tommy is seemingly the only silent person in the theatre.
ANGLE ON Greg, still looking at Tommy. What was supposed
to be the best night of his life has turned into maybe
the worst. Tommy stares straight ahead. The laughter like
daggers.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON SCREEN
“THE ROOM”
The big clean shaven reveal. Greg comes through the door.
“MARK”
“So... you like it?”
“JOHNNY”
“You look like a babyface!”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 107

ANGLE on Greg in the audience, remembering this moment
and all that came after. And then BACK ON SCREEN:
“DENNY”
“You guys wanna play football?”
“EVERYONE”
“Sure./Great.”
“PETER”
“I don’t think so.”
TOMMY
“Come on... Don’t be chicken. Cheep cheep
cheep cheep.”
And everyone joins in...
“EVERYONE”
“Cheep cheep cheep cheep.”
All of which is met with loud laughter and big applause.
Tommy looks to be on the verge of tears. It’s
heartbreaking. He can’t take anymore. He stands and walks
out, not wanting anyone to see him lose it.
Greg sees this. And yeah he’s definitely still harboring
that ill will towards Tommy but, fuck man, nobody
deserves this. He decides to go after him.
CUT TO:
INT MOVIE THEATRE - LOBBY - SAME
Tommy has to lean against a wall to keep from falling
apart. Greg comes out and sees him.
TOMMY
They hate it.
GREG
No, Tommy, they’re...
Greg doesn’t really know what to say.
GREG
They’re just laughing.
TOMMY
They’re laughing at me.
Tommy starts to get emotional.
TOMMY
Maybe everyone right, Greg. Maybe it’s
true. I am a joke.
Tommy...

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 108

Tommy is lower than Greg or any of us have ever seen to
this point. It breaks Greg’s heart.
GREG
Hey, listen to me. That thing up there.
That’s your MOVIE, man. You made it - YOU
- all by yourself. Do you know how
special that is? It’s incredible. How
many people get to say they did something
like that?
Tommy is starting to slowly come around to Greg’s point
of view.
GREG
And, yeah, ok, maybe it didn’t turn out
exactly as you hoped. But listen for a
second. Do you hear that? Come with me...
Greg pulls Tommy back towards the entrance. He opens the
door. They walk back in:
INT. MOVIE THEATRE - SAME
Standing in the back, Tommy and Greg witness:
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, everyone is still laughing, in
fact it’s louder now. People going crazy.
GREG
Look how much fun they’re having. They’re
fucking loving it, Tommy. This is what
it’s all about.
Tommy is still conflicted. But maybe Greg makes a good
point.
GREG
How many times you think Hitchcock got
this kind of response?
Never.

TOMMY

GREG
That’s right. But you did.
And now Tommy is really coming around. Greg reaches out,
touches Tommy on the shoulder. A gesture that surprises
Tommy. He looks up at Greg, his old friend. Greg looks at
him with respect and admiration. With love for his friend
again. They stand there and watch:
ANGLE ON SCREEN

“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” decides to commit suicide. But first he writhes
on the ground, humps the RED DRESS, fumbles with the GUN,
and, only then, puts it in his mouth and pulls the
trigger.
CUT TO:

As the audience starts shouting “do it! Do it!” Greg
looks at Tommy. He sees a small smile cross his face. And
he knows - he’s gotten through to him. They can both
enjoy this now.

“Johnny” lying there dead - with “Denny” and “Lisa” now
also “Mark” again hovering above him - the final FADE OUT

ANGLE ON GREG AND TOMMY
A beat between them. Neither one sure how the audience
will react now.
And then RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE.
Tommy looks at Greg. Takes off his sunglasses. A big
smile on his face now. All around him, everyone is
standing, cheering, applauding his movie.
People seem legitimately enthusiastic about “The Room.”
His dream come true - if not exactly as he intended. He
nods to Greg. Greg nods back. Friends again.
And then, in an instant, he starts jogging up to the
front, his arms raised over his head in triumph. The
adulation only grows as he’s handed a microphone, heads
up to the stage.
TOMMY
So I’m glad you liked my... comedic
movie!
Everyone applauds. Greg laughs to himself at that.
TOMMY
As everybody know, I make this movie
completely by myself. People say “Tommy
you crazy” but I say “yeah so what? My
vision, my money, you must believe in
yourself.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 110

A beat. And Tommy grows somber.
TOMMY
I must be honest. There were times when
maybe I didn’t believe. But I have friend
- I have best friend. And he believe in
me.
Tommy looks at Greg. A nice moment .
TOMMY
This movie never happen without my best
friend Greg. Come on up, Babyface!
Greg smiles, a little embarrassed but also appreciative.
He walks up on stage. Gives Tommy a hug.
Tommy steps aside. Lets Greg bask in the spotlight, the
audience cheering him loudly. After a beat, Tommy joins
him. Leans into the mic:
TOMMY
Now who’s ready for after party?!
And on the cheers of the crowd, FADE UP MUSIC and over
