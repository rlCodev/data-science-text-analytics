INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (MONTAGE)

A26

This day/night sequence repeats again and again, with
only slight variations (mostly in the janitorial tasks). The
big change comes in the hands, which over time, get old:
liver spotted, wrinkled, arthritic, the occasional Band Aid
on one or another of the fingers. The image itself, through
his POV, degrades, as well, becoming softer, dimmer, less
vibrant. The sound becomes less distinct and by a constant
whispery hum.
(Note: Throughout the remainder of the film, there is a
constant whisper under everything, sometimes the wind,
sometimes a voice, sometimes both. On occasion, it will
resolve into the Voice-Over of the Young Woman, then back to
a vague, inarticulate whisper).

INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - DAY

27

Everything is slower now. The Janitor’s POV takes in the
environment as it moves toward the table with a cup of
coffee. The room is neat but old, slightly tattered, the
drapes are heavy and oppressive. It feels airless, a place
with endlessly wandering ghosts. The Janitor once again
places the coffee on the dining room table, sits, scoops
sugar from a bowl, dumps it in the coffee, stirs, turns on
the small portable TV on the table. Snow on the screen. He
switches the channel and a young couple appears, engaging, to
a bouncy musical score, in a happy dating montage. The man
sips at his coffee and watches for a long moment, checks his
watch, stands, heads to the kitchen. The bouncy music
continues but recedes as he walks away from the TV. The
whispering builds.
28

INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

28

The Janitor brings the cup and spoon to the sink and washes
them. He glances out the window above the sink at the world
outside. It is a gray, windy winter day. Old, crusty snow on
the ground. A rusted swing set sits in the yard, the swings
creaking in the wind. He dries the dishes, puts them away,
scans the kitchen for anything out of place. He refolds a
poorly folded dishrag, hangs it from its hook, spends a
moment to even it out. He exits the kitchen.
29

INT DINING ROOM - DAY
The Janitor passes the still turned-on TV, glances at it.
The couple are in a field, on their backs and under a
blanket, looking up at the night sky.

YOUNG TV MAN
How did we ever find each other in

YOUNG WOMAN
Almost makes an artist like me

He laughs. They kiss. The Janitor has passed the TV and makes
his way upstairs.
30

INT. FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

30

The Janitor brushes his teeth, never looking at his
reflection in the mirror.
31

EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

31

The Janitor exits the house, which is weathered. He carries
a paper lunch bag and thermos. The wind whistles. He climbs
into the pick-up truck, turns the ignition key.
32

INT. RURAL ROAD - PICK UP TRUCK - DAY
The Janitor drives the quiet rural road. The radio is on.

Ah-ooga!
33

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

33

The Janitor, lunch bag and thermos in hand, crunches on the
hard snow.
34

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

34

The Janitor makes his way through the empty hall. The bell
sounds, sudden and loud, and the hall is filled with raucous
students. The Janitor is invisible to them as they
carelessly maneuver their way around him. He watches their
faces, their interactions, their youth, their romances, their
enthusiasm. He spots the outliers: the lonely, the ugly, the
desperately sad.
35

INT. CUSTODIAN’S ROOM - DAY

35

The Janitor opens his locker, places his lunch and thermos on
the shelf, and removes his shirt, revealing a sagging, old
man’s torso. He changes into a dark work shirt emblazoned
with the school’s name. He closes the locker, organizes the
supplies on his cart, rolls it to the door, and waits until
the voices of the students peter out. Then he opens the door,
wheels the cart into the mostly empty hall.
36

INT. HALL - DAY

36

There are only a few student stragglers. The Janitor pushes
the cart, wheels it into the first classroom.
37

INT. CLASSROOM ONE - DAY

37

THE JANITOR EMPTIES THE ROOM’S TRASH CANS INTO THE LARGE ONE
ON HIS CART. HE WIPES A DUST RAG ALONG THE TABLE TOPS AND
THE WINDOW LEDGE. OUTSIDE SNOW HAS STARTED TO FALL. HE
WATCHES THE SNOW, SEEMINGLY TRANSFIXED.
38

EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - DAY

38

A Young Woman waits. She is dressed for the cold, her quirky,
adorable outfit topped with a cheerily colorful wool beanie.
She looks both ways down the street, waiting for someone. She
notices the snowflakes, and playfully tries to catch a few on
her tongue.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

10.

Suddenly, she feels self-conscious, glances around to see if
she is being watched, peering into dark apartment windows.
She spots a young man driving toward her. This is Jake. A
fleeting look of worry passes across her face, then she
smiles, waves enthusiastically. He smiles back, waves, pulls
to a stop in front of her. She opens the door.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s snowing!
JAKE
Winter is icummen in.
Goddamn!

YOUNG WOMAN

They laugh. She climbs into the car. They kiss.
39

INT. CAR - DAY

39

They drive through a university town; it is oddly
underpopulated. She looks out the window. Although her outfit
is the same, the colors seem more subdued now. Jake watches
the road. She glances over at him, takes in his face in
profile. Feeling her eyes on him, he glances over. She
smiles. He smiles self-consciously, looks back at the road.
She flips down her sun visor, opens the mirror, the mirror is
missing, she flips the visor back up. Her mood has turned
somber. The whispering sound increases in volume.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I’m thinking of ending things.
Silence.
Huh?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s that?
JAKE
Did you say something?
YOUNG WOMAN
(laughing)
No. I don’t think so.
Weird.

JAKE

Silence. She looks out the window.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)

Jake glances over again. She doesn’t make eye contact.
looks back to road.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
What’s the point of carrying on
like this? I know what it is, where
it’s going. Jake is a nice guy,
but... It’s not going anywhere.
I’ve known this for a while now.
Maybe it’s human nature to keep
going even in the face of this
knowledge. The alternative
requires too much energy,
decisiveness. People stay in
unhealthy relationships because
it’s easier. It’s basic physics. An
object in motion tends to stay in
motion; people tend to stay in
relationships past their expiration
date. Newton’s first law of
emotion.
JAKE
Do you want to stop for a coffee or
something? A snack? It’s going to
get pretty farmy pretty fast now.

He

12.
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh. No. I’m fine.
You sure?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t want to spoil my appetite!
Ok.

JAKE

Silence. She studies his hands on the steering wheel. He selfconsciously takes the one closest to her from the wheel, and
slips it into his jacket pocket.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Y’know, my mother hasn’t been
feeling well recently. So...
I’m sorry.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
I’m just saying that there might
not be much of a spread. She might
not be up to a lot of cooking.
(beat)
She hasn’t been well.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry to hear that.
going on with --

What’s

JAKE
I’m just saying, if you want to
stop for a snack, it would probably
be fine. In terms of appetite
spoiling. In terms of the amount of
food she might have prepared. It
might even be advisable.
I’m fine.
Ok.

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

Silence.
JAKE (CONT'D)
They really are looking forward to
meeting you.
(MORE)

13.
JAKE (CONT'D)
I don’t want to give you the wrong
impression. I’ve told them a lot
about you.
YOUNG WOMAN
(looking over at Jake)
That’s nice to hear. I’m looking
forward to meeting them, too.
She looks out the window.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
Maybe it’s unfair of me to be going
on this trip with Jake. When I’m
so uncertain about our future. Our
lack of it. After all, going to
meet your boyfriend’s parents is
the proverbial next step, isn’t it?
The truth is, I haven’t even told
my parents I’m dating Jake. I’ve
never mentioned him. And I don’t
think I ever will. I guess that
says a lot about my intentions.
JAKE
It’s just that she hasn’t been
feeling well. So...
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry. Getting old ain’t for
sissies, as Bette Davis said.
JAKE
True. Although one might take issue
with her use of the word sissy as a
pejorative.
YOUNG WOMAN
Of course. Yes. A different time.
Silence.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I guess it’s curiosity. Jake is
certainly hard to figure. Maybe
it’s like a window into his
origins. The child being father of
the man, and all.
JAKE
Oh, are you a fan of Wordsworth
then, by chance?

14.
YOUNG WOMAN
Wordsworth?
JAKE
William Wordsworth? The poet?
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not familiar, really. Why do
you ask?
JAKE
I was just thinking about him, for
some reason. He popped into my
head. His poem Ode: Intimations of
Immortality from Recollections of
Early Childhood, to be specific.
YOUNG WOMAN
Jesus, that’s the title? Seems like
an entire poem.
Ha. Yeah.

JAKE

Silence. She silently counts syllables.
YOUNG WOMAN
I tried to make it into a haiku.
Too many syllables. Damn.
JAKE
Ha. You get your words’ worth with
Wordworth.
Ha.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
(beat)
You want to hear how it starts?
Ok. Sure.

YOUNG WOMAN

As Jake recites, the young woman watches the passing bleak
farmland.

15.
JAKE
(reciting)
There was a time when meadow,
grove, and stream,/The earth, and
every common sight,/To me did
seem/Apparell'd in celestial
light,/The glory and the freshness
of a dream./It is not now as it
hath been of yore;—/Turn
wheresoe'er I may,/By night or
day,/The things which I have seen I
now can see no more.
YOUNG WOMAN
Huh. Well, that’s heavy. Sad.
JAKE
It goes on like that. More or less.
YOUNG WOMAN
You recite it well. I like your
voice.
JAKE
I guess, there’s hope in it, too.
But... I dunno, maybe they have to
do that, give people something.
YOUNG WOMAN
I confess, I haven’t read a lot of
poetry. I guess, I mostly don’t
understand it.
(joking)
I’m not a metaphorical-type gal.
JAKE
It’s just that that one speaks to
me.
Yeah.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Incidentally, Wordsworth wrote a
series of poems to a woman named
Lucy.
Like me!

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Exactly. A beautiful, idealized
woman who dies young.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

Yikes.

16.
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Ha. Well, the comparison goes only
as far as your name.
Phew.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
And that you are ideal, of course.
YOUNG WOMAN
(uneasily)
Aw. That’s sweet.
She smiles at him. Silence.
A phone rings, loud, surprising. Urgently, the Young Woman
fishes in the bag by her feet, finds the phone, pulls it out,
checks the caller: Lucy. **YOUNG WOMAN APPEARANCE CHANGE**
JAKE
Who’s that?
YOUNG WOMAN
Just a friend. I’m not going to
answer.
JAKE
You can. I don’t mind. You should.
It’s ok.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
I don’t mind.
She drops the phone back in her bag.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Mysterious.
YOUNG WOMAN
What’s that?
A friend.

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha. Not really. Someone from class.

*

17.
She looks out the window at depressed and abandoned farms.
She sees a collapsed farm house with a brand new swing set in
the front yard. It’s jarring.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
That’s odd.
JAKE
What’s that?
YOUNG WOMAN
Did you see that swing set?
JAKE
What swing set?
YOUNG WOMAN
We just passed it.
Nope.

JAKE
Missed it.

YOUNG WOMAN
It was weird. This beautiful new
swing set in front of an abandoned
house.
JAKE
I didn’t see it.
YOUNG WOMAN
Why would that be there? Clearly
no one has lived in that house for
years. Decades.
JAKE
I didn’t see it.
(beat)
Maybe someone is moving in and they
brought the swing set first?
That’s all I can think of.
YOUNG WOMAN
I suppose.
(beat)
That seems an unlikely sequence of
events.
JAKE
Well, I didn’t see it.
(beat)
Like to have something to entertain
the kids while the parents are
getting the house ready?

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

Huh. Yeah.
(beat)
Odd.

18.
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Who knows?
(beat)
They’re saying there might be a
fair amount of snow.
Yeah?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
They’re predicting it.
YOUNG WOMAN
Do you think we should maybe turn
back? I’ve got a fair amount -- a
lot actually -- of work to do
tomorrow. I need to be able to get
home tonight, so I can get to it
first thing.
JAKE
I think we’ll be ok. I’ve got tire
chains in the trunk.

Ok.

YOUNG WOMAN
(dubious)

JAKE
What are you working on?
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh, um, I have a paper due
Wednesday.
JAKE
Which one is this?
YOUNG WOMAN
Susceptibility to rabies infection
in the sensory dorsal root ganglia
neurons.
JAKE
Right. The trigeminal ganglia, as
well, right?
YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. Exactly.

*

19.
JAKE
Point for me. Interested in and
knowledgeable about my girlfriend’s
work.
She reacts to the “my girlfriend.”
YOUNG WOMAN
Point for Jake.
JAKE
How’s the paper going?
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s nowhere, actually. I really do
have to get back tonight. Deal with
it first thing.
JAKE
I’ll get you home. Chains.
Chains.

YOUNG WOMAN

YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I do like Jake. And he’s educated.
Our fields are different, but he’s
curious and keeps up. That’s a good
thing. That’s in the pro column.
She smiles over at Jake.

He smiles back, seemingly relieved.

YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
And he’s cute. In his awkward way.
We are interesting together, as
well. People look at us when we’re
together. Who’s that couple? I
don’t get looked at alone. Not
much. And Jake doesn’t either, he
tells me. Maybe that’s the way it
is in general for guys. No one
looks at them. But Jake has told
me he feels it, feels invisible.
JAKE
Want to listen to something?
He has white crust in the corner of his mouth. She fixates on
it.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry, what?

20.
He wipes away the crust, as if he knows she’s seeing it.
JAKE
I asked if you want to listen to
some music.
Oh.

Sure.

YOUNG WOMAN

Jake switches on the radio, dials through the static.
JAKE
When you get out this far, there’s
not much signal.
He finds a station playing Many a New Day from the musical
Oklahoma! The reception is iffy, giving the music an almost
underwater burble and, in addition, it sounds amateurish,
performed by high school students.
SINGER
Many a new face will please my eye/
Many a new love will find me/Never
have I once looked back to sigh/
Over the romance behind me/Many a
new day will dawn/Before I do
YOUNG WOMAN
This is an odd song. Out here in
the middle of nothing.
JAKE
It’s from Oklahoma! The musical.
Apt.
Indeed.

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t realize you were a fan of
musical theater. You’re full of
surprises.
JAKE
I’m not really. Into musicals, I

INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

The Janitor sweeps between the seats, while on stage a
rehearsal for Oklahoma! is in progress. High school girls
dance around the girl playing Laurey, as she sings along with
an inept orchestra. A high school-quality farm house set
squats on the stage behind them. A teenage girl, dressed as
an old lady, sits on a rocker on the porch.

So you like this type of landscape?

It’s beautiful, yes. Melancholy. I
do like that.

It’s the poet in you.

Ha. Yeah. I suppose so. Maybe.

You been working on anything?

You’re so good at reciting them.

Not really, but thanks.

(laughing)
“Wow” is pretty much an all-purpose
exclamation, I just realized. It
could mean you loved it or that
there are no other words to
describe how rubbish it is.
JAKE
I love it. That’s what it means.
YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah? I don’t know.
JAKE
It’s amazing. I feel like it’s
about me. Like completely.
YOUNG WOMAN
Well, thanks. I guess that’s the
thing one hopes for when writing a
poem.
JAKE
What’s that?
YOUNG WOMAN
Some universality in the specific?
I don’t know.

26.
JAKE
Yeah. A feeling of connection. It’s
like you wrote it about me. I don’t
know how you do it.
Do what?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Think in words without setting
those thoughts in stone. Use
language not to corral the world,
but to set it free.
Wow.

YOUNG WOMAN

They both laugh at her use of the word “wow.”
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Anyway, I don’t know that I do all
that, but thanks.
JAKE
You really do. It’s a marvel.
YOUNG WOMAN
A marvel, no less! Well, thanks.
Sure.

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
You’re very sweet.
The Young Woman looks out the window.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I’m thinking of ending things. Jake
is really great. He’s sensitive.
He listens to me. He’s smart.
There’s just something...
ineffable? Profoundly, unutterably,
unfixably wrong here. I almost wish
he were horrible, some monster,
that he beat me, that he was a
drunk, that he ignored me. Then my
decision would be clear.
She looks over at Jake. He glances back, fearful.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
But he’s just not right. And no
amount of more time will fix that.

27.
JAKE
Is something wrong? I’m feeling -No.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
You seem sort of far away, is all.
YOUNG WOMAN
Just thinking.
JAKE
About what?
YOUNG WOMAN
(considering, stalling)
About what? Hmm. I don’t know.
Just vague “in my head” stuff.
(beat)
I guess maybe I was thinking about
time.
Really?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
How it’s in charge of us, like
we’re on a train and it takes us
where it takes us. There’s no
veering off. No side trips. And
like Mussolini’s trains; it runs on
time.
JAKE
I read that it’s not really true
about Mussolini and trains. The
improvements in the railway system
preceded him. He just took credit.
And even so, they still didn’t
always run on time.
YOUNG WOMAN
Huh. I guess that’s not really
where I was going with that
analogy. Not really about
Mussolini.
JAKE
(beat)
Anyway, you can always jump off a
train, right?

28.
YOUNG WOMAN
In movies, maybe. In real life you
will likely die jumping from a
moving train.
JAKE
That’s true, I suppose. I watch too
many movies. That’s very true.
YOUNG WOMAN
Everyone does. A societal malady.
JAKE
I fill my brain with lies to pass
the time. And it does pass -- in
the blink of an eye. An eye blink
in excruciatingly slow motion.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s like the rabies virus
attaching itself to our ganglia,
then changing us into itself.
JAKE
Viruses are monstrous.
YOUNG WOMAN
Everything wants to live, Jake.
Viruses are just one more example
of everything.
I suppose.

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Even crappy, fake movie ideas want
to live. They grow in your brain,
replacing your real ideas. That’s
what makes them dangerous.
JAKE
But did you know there are insects
that blow themselves up? So there’s
that. Not everything wants to live.
YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. Certain ants, certain aphids.
JAKE
For the good of their communities.
YOUNG WOMAN
Suicide bombers.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

JAKE
So not everything wants to live.
YOUNG WOMAN
True. Well, they want their
communities to live, which is sort
of like themselves writ large.
(beat)
And, also, we don’t know if they
really want anything. It’s more
likely just how they’re programmed.
JAKE
Maybe we’re all programmed. Right?
He looks at her for some kind of confirmation. The Young
Woman glances over at him and makes a gesture and noise as if
she’s exploding. They laugh.
YOUNG WOMAN
Now we’re both dead.

The driveway is long and bumpy with potholes. They make their

I used to love to be outside here
when I was a kid. The stars are
amazing here when it’s not cloudy.
I would lie on my back and look at
them for hours. I don’t know when
I stopped doing that. It’s weird,
there was a last time I did that
and I didn’t know at the time that
it would be. Isn’t that
interesting? The last time you do
something is often a secret from
you at the time.
YOUNG WOMAN
It is interesting.
They park and walk towards the barn.
JAKE
Maybe we’ll come back in the spring
and we can lie out here and look up
at the universe. Then whenever
that was won’t have been my last
time. My last time will be with
you.
YOUNG WOMAN
That sounds nice.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I do like that Jake once had this
side to him. A child filled with
wonder. He’s so burdened now,

buried under all that.

it must be like to be a sheep, to
spend one’s entire life in this

nothing. Eating. Shitting.
Sleeping. Over and over.

They’re always chewing like that.
It’s their cud.

So.. They’re fine. No worries.

toward the house in the distance.
JAKE (CONT'D)
They had to put them down.

Uh-huh. That’s too bad.
JAKE
Rotten situation. The pigs. Life
isn’t always pretty on a farm.

So, what happened?

To the pigs? Forget it. I don’t

YOUNG WOMAN
You have to tell me now. You can’t
do that.
Yeah?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes! Jesus.
JAKE
Ok. Well, my father hadn’t been in
to check on the pigs for a few
days. My parents were busy. He’d
just toss their food into the pen.
But after a few days, he noticed
they were just lying in the same
corner all the time. So he went
inside to check on them. They
didn’t look well. He decided he’d
better try to move them. And
they’re heavy -- I mean, they’re
pigs, right? -- but he finally
moved one and discovered that its
entire underside was filled with
maggots. Both pigs were being eaten
alive. Life on a farm can be
brutal. Should we go in? It’s cold.

One likes to think there is always
hope. It is a uniquely human
fantasy that things will get
better, born, perhaps, of the
uniquely human understanding that
things will not. There’s no way to
know for certain, but I suspect
humans are the only animals that
know the inevitability of their own
death. Other animals live in the
present. Humans cannot. So they
invented hope.

Woman notices that the mother’s big toe has no nail.
MOTHER
So Jake tells us you’re a painter?
YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. Jake tells you correctly.
FATHER
I don’t really know much about art,
but I like pictures where you know
what you’re looking at.
JAKE
(into his plate)
Dad. For Christ’s sake.
FATHER
What do you call it -- abstract? -I don’t get that. I mean, I could
do abstract, smear paint on a, what
is it called -- a canvas? -- I
think it’s a con job, if you ask
me. I like paintings that look like
a photograph. I couldn’t do one of
those in a million years. That’s
talent.
JAKE
Why not just take a photograph,
Dad, if you like photographs? It’s
much quicker. And photographs look
exactly like photographs.

I like photographs. Mostly sports
photographs.

(to young woman)
What kind of paintings do you make,
Lucy?

Um, Well, I’m not an abstract
painter! So that’s in my favor.

Good.
(to no one in particular)
See? That’s exactly my point.
Good.
YOUNG WOMAN
I do mostly landscapes.
FATHER
Like outside paintings?
YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah. Plein Air. Which is outdoor
painting. I try to capture the feel
of the light and atmosphere.

That sounds lovely. Jake used to
paint, too, of course.

He worked really hard at it.
YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t know that! Jake!
Jake doesn’t look up.
MOTHER
He was very good.
YOUNG WOMAN
I try to imbue my work with a kind
of interiority.
FATHER
Interiority. So you paint insides?
I thought -YOUNG WOMAN
Inside my head. So a landscape
would attempt to express how I’m
feeling at the time: lonely,
joyous, worried, sad.

47.
MOTHER
That sounds very interesting. Like
that painting of that girl sitting
in a field looking at a house?
YOUNG WOMAN
Christina’s World. Wyeth. Yes.
Exactly. But without people.
FATHER
How can a picture of a field be sad
without a sad person looking sad in
the field?
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s an interesting problem.
That’s what I struggle with. I have
some pictures of my work, if you’d
like to see.
Oh, yes.

MOTHER

FATHER
Yeah, sure.
The Young Woman pulls out her phone, sees that there have
been several calls from Louisa. She ignores them, opens up
her portfolio, crosses the table, places herself between the
Mother and Father, and shows them her work. The painting are
beautiful: expressionistic, vast, lonely wintry landscapes.
FATHER (CONT'D)
I mean, they’re pretty, but I don’t
see how they’re supposed to make me
feel something if there’s not a
person in them feeling sad or
joyous or whatever other emotion
you said.
YOUNG WOMAN
Maybe think of yourself as the
person, looking out at the scene.
FATHER
I’d have to see me in them.
YOUNG WOMAN
As if you’re there. If you were
there, you wouldn’t see yourself,
right?

48-48A.
FATHER
I would if I looked down. I’m not a
ghost! Yet!
The Father and the Mother laugh.
MOTHER
I can attest to that! Especially in
the bedroom!
Jesus.

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Sure. But if you were just looking
out at it, without looking down.
You’d just see the scene and feel
something. Anything an environment
makes you feel is all about you and
not the environment, right? None
of the feeling is inherent to
place.
FATHER
Well, that’s over my head, I guess.
MOTHER
They are pretty though. You’re very
talented. I like the colors.

MOTHER
Jake, you didn’t tell us your
girlfriend is so talented.
JAKE
(to his food)
I did, actually.

So Jake tells us you’re studying
physics at the university.
Yes.

FATHER
That’s unusual for a girl, isn’t
it?
Dad.

JAKE

FATHER
I’m just asking.
YOUNG WOMAN
It is, actually. But a little less
so these days. Which is good, I
think.
MOTHER
Well, after seventh grade, I could
never understand what Jake was
saying! So it’s wonderful he has
someone he can talk to about all
his ideas!
FATHER
Jake tells us there have been a lot
of famous husband and wife
physicists.
JAKE
Jesus, Dad.
YOUNG WOMAN
I guess there have been some.
Pierre and Marie Curie shared a
Nobel Prize in Physics.
FATHER
Even I’ve heard of them. Well, her,
anyway. Radiation.
MOTHER
Radioactivity.

Yes.

YOUNG WOMAN

FATHER
I never heard of him, though.
MOTHER
It’s all so exciting. And I’m so
glad Jake has found someone. Won’t
you please tell us the story of how
you met? Jake has refused.

MOTHER (CONT'D)
I love romantic meeting stories.
Like in Forget Paris? Billy
Crystal?
FATHER
I didn’t like that movie.
The Young Woman looks over at Jake. He stares down at his
plate. She looks at the Mother, who waits, expectantly.
YOUNG WOMAN
Um, so, I went with a friend to a
bar near campus. It turned out to
be trivia night.
MOTHER
I love this so far. Jake is crazy
about trivia. We used to play the
genius edition of Trivial Pursuit
and -Genus.
What?

JAKE
MOTHER

JAKE
It’s genus edition.
MOTHER
Really? I’ve always thought the
word was genius. I’ve been saying
it wrong all these years! It goes
to show...
(punchline)
... I’m no genus!
She laughs. The Father laughs.
FATHER
That’s a good one.
JAKE
No. Genus is not the same as
genius. A genus is a category.
MOTHER
Oh. I always thought it was the
genius edition. I told everybody
you knew every answer in the genius
edition. I was very proud of that.

MOTHER (CONT'D)
Why didn’t we get the genius
edition?
JAKE
(yelling into his plate)
There is no genius edition!
The Young Woman looks at him, frightened by his anger.
MOTHER
Ok. I didn’t understand. Ok.
Silence. Everyone eats. The Young Woman tries to lighten the
mood. **YOUNG WOMAN APPEARANCE CHANGES**
YOUNG WOMAN
So Jake was with his trivia team
and my friend and I found an empty
table near them. I was watching
him.
MOTHER
Because you thought he was cute!
YOUNG WOMAN
Ha. Yeah, I did. And very serious
about the game, which I found -- I
don’t know -- charming. His team
was called... what?
JAKE
Brehznev’s Eyebrows.
YOUNG WOMAN
Right. Brehznev’s Eyebrows. I asked
him who Brehznev was. Basically
because I wanted to say something
to him. He told me Brehznev was a
Soviet engineer, General...
JAKE
... Secretary of the Communist
Party.
YOUNG WOMAN
During the Age of Starvation.
JAKE
Stagnation.
YOUNG WOMAN
Stagnation. Anyway, those kind of
team names drive me nuts, usually.
They all have them, those teams.

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Show-offy. But, I don’t know, it
didn’t bother me with Jake.
(to Mother)
Maybe I just didn’t let it, because
I thought he was cute.
MOTHER
Aw. He is cute, isn’t he?
YOUNG WOMAN
He is. So I was trying to get up
the nerve to talk to him, because
even though he had looked over at
me more than once, it was clear he
was not going to say anything.
FATHER
Didn’t you just say you talked
about Brehznev?
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh. Yes. That’s true But then we
didn’t talk anymore after that, I
guess, is what I meant.
Oh.

FATHER

YOUNG WOMAN
So I said something stupid like,
you guys seem to be doing well. I
had to yell it, practically; it was
so noisy. He held up his beer and
said, We’re helpfully fortified.
And I laughed and the ice was
broken. I think he was egged on by
my laughing, so he told me he is a
cruci...
JAKE
...verbalist.
YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t know what it meant. But I
didn’t want to admit that, so I
just said, cool. He was showing off
again and poorly, but I guess I
thought, ok, this guy is awkward.
He doesn’t have any game at all.
There was something sort of
appealing about that. But then it
kept going. He said he had wanted
the team name to be Ipseity.

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
And I was like, ugh, now it’s
getting to be too much.
MOTHER
You didn’t like him anymore?
Jake looks over at the Young Woman.
YOUNG WOMAN
No. I did. I just wanted that stuff
to stop. So I said, I don’t know
that word and you know I don’t know
that word, so why don’t you just
cut the crap? He said something
like, I’m an asshole. I’m not very
good at talking to people, and
ipseity is just another word for
selfhood. Anyway, after that he
just talked like a normal person
and he was funny. And I could see
he wanted to ask for my number but
was shy. Then my friend wanted to
go, and so I was getting up, and he
just blurted out, could he have my
number.
FATHER
Way to go, Jake! About time!
YOUNG WOMAN
And I was very glad he did. The
rest is history. That was like,
what, six weeks ago? I don’t know.
Feels longer. Feels like forever,
in a way. I can’t really remember
how long ago it is. Feels like
forever.
MOTHER
What a wonderful story! It could be
in a movie!
(beat)
“Feels like forever.” That’s very
romantic.

He is pushed out the door. Yvonne closes it behind him. He

They’re all still at the dinner table. The Mother wears a
slightly different dress now. She seems a bit older. Her
nailless toe is now wrapped in a bandage. The Father’s Band

in an outfit slightly different than earlier, slightly
reminiscent of Yvonne’s STREET CLOTHES **YOUNG WOMAN

but uncertain.

Jake was always a good boy. He was
even awarded a diligence pin at

Diligence. At eight. Can you
believe that? It was quite a thing.
His father and I never got awarded
any such pin at eight.

True enough. At no age.

The Mother shoots the father a look, gets up and makes her
way to the kitchen, touching his shoulder on the way.
MOTHER
Help me, I’ll serve dessert in the
sitting room.
There’s something in the way she says “help me” that isn’t a
casual plea for kitchen help. He nods, gets up and follows
her out of the room.

is anxious. The photos are of the family: Jake as a teen, his
parents. There are a couple of photos of his parents older
than they are now, one in which they look elderly and feeble.
JAKE
Just some old family photos.
She looks over at him and nods. When she looks back, those
photos of his parents older are gone. She searches for them.
Her eyes come to rest on a photo of a young girl. The Young
Woman is startled.
Wait.

You can’t tell?
No.

Oh, really? How fascinating.

I’ve always been interested in
problems associated with aging. I
think our society has an almost
repulsed relationship to the aged,
which is eminently foolish, because
it’s a natural and inevitable part

terribly unkind.

“Humiliations,” and “The Ways People Have Looked at Me,” and
“Recurring Dreams of Failure.” There are childhood games,
used bandages, porn magazines, a cremation urn labeled
“Jimmy.” There are books on the shelves: Wordsworth, Anna
Karenina, Virology, a collection of Pauline Kael film
reviews, A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again by David
Foster Wallace, Theory of Colors by Goethe. There’s a
collection of poems by Eva H.D. open on the night table. She
picks it up and sees the it is open to the poem Bonedog. A

Mom.

JAKE

MOTHER
Diligent. He won a pin. Maybe not
as naturally talented as some of
the other students. But he worked
so hard. And that’s even more
impressive. Being a genus is like
being beautiful.
Genius

JAKE

MOTHER
Genius. The luck of the draw,
really, the genetic lottery, as
they say. But to do as well as Jake
did with no special talent or
abilities, that’s much more
impressive.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

Yes.

YOUNG WOMAN

(to Jake)
Maybe you should put the chains on?
(curt)
Soon!

The Young Woman reacts to Jake’s tone, backing away slightly.
Ok.

JAKE
(conciliatory)
We’ll leave soon. Let me just
finish up here.

The storm is brutal. The Janitor, mumbling, empties trash
into a dumpster. He turns and watches the storm.

The Young Woman kisses Jake on the forehead. Her attitude
has shifted. She looks at him with affection. **YOUNG WOMAN
APPEARANCE CHANGE - WARMER**
YOUNG WOMAN
-- I’m impressed with your
attentiveness to your mom. It’s
rare. We tend to warehouse our
elderly. It’s really special how
devoted a son you are.
JAKE
Thanks. I’m glad to hear you say
that. It makes me feel a bit
better. Sometimes it feels like no
one sees the good things you do.
Like you’re just alone.
YOUNG WOMAN
I see. I’ll wait downstairs. Give
you some privacy.
The Young Woman turns.

She heads back to the stairs. Her expression shifts slowly to
something harder, resolved, as she walks.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I should end this. Just end it. I
Just make a clean break. No
lingering. No waiting for things to
get better. You can only wait so
long.
She’s descending the stairs now, which seem longer than on
the way up. **YOUNG WOMAN _ MULTI APPEARANCE CHANGES**
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I don’t know who I am in this whole
thing anymore, where I stop and
Jake starts. I’m a pinball. My
emotional state is bouncing all
over the place. Jake sees me ...
needs to see me as someone who sees
him. He needs to be seen and he
needs to be seen with approval.
Like that’s my purpose in all this,
in life. To approve of Jake. To
keep him going. And he needs to
see me as someone whose approval of
him is validated because I’m
approved of by others. Look at my
girlfriend. Look at what I won.
She’s smart. She’s talented. She’s
sensitive. She can do this. She
knows about that. She made this.
She cares about that.

I need to end it.

FATHER
I got your mom’s...

He holds up a nightgown. It has a post-it with the word
“nightgown” on it.
FATHER (CONT'D)
(reading)
... nightgown for her.
The Father, with a Parkinsonian tremor, holds out the
nightgown the Mother had just been wearing. The Young Woman
takes it, her hand touching some still-wet spilled baby food.
She tries to hide her revulsion, but Jake sees it, reacts.
YOUNG WOMAN
That’s very kind. But I’m going to
have to head home tonight. Soon.
FATHER
I don’t understand.
(to Jake)
What does she mean?
JAKE
I don’t know, Dad. I can’t tell
exactly. It’s not exactly clear.
YOUNG WOMAN
I have my shift tomorrow.
JAKE
She’s a waitress. We met when she
was serving me. It’s a sweet story.
I asked her what she thought of the
Santa Fe burger -FATHER
I’m feeling confused.
JAKE
(to Father)
Let’s just get you to the bathroom.
We don’t want another accident.
Remember last night?
No.

FATHER

Jake leads his father off. The Young Woman drapes the
nightgown over the stairway banister and looks out the window
at the storm.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

MOTHER (O.C.)
What’s this old thing doing here?
The Young Woman turns to see the Mother holding the
nightgown. This is a very young version of the Mother (1950s
look).
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not sure.
MOTHER
Oh my goodness. It’s filthy! It’s
got Jake’s baby food on it! What’s
it doing here? I tell you, I would
misplace my own head if it wasn’t
screwed onto my shoulders.
(laughs)
Would you be a sweetheart and toss
this in the washer. I just started
a load. My hands are full picking
up all these darn toys.
She laughs. Children’s toys are scattered around the room.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
Jake would leave his head on the
floor if it wasn’t screwed onto his
shoulders.
YOUNG WOMAN
Sure. Where is it?
MOTHER
In the basement.
She nods toward the scratched-up door.
YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t think Jake wants me down
there.
MOTHER
Jake Jake Jake. Jake can be
controlling. You can’t allow him to
control you. I think that’s the
other side of his type of
personality, of this diligence
thing. He needs to control
everything. There are so many, many
things that make him nervous that
he just keeps closing more and more
of the world off.

MOTHER (CONT'D)
I’m sure I’m to blame, but then all
that guilt just causes me to feel
obligated to bend over backwards to
accommodate his every little whim.
It’s a vicious cycle.
The Young Woman and the Mother watch each other for a long
moment.
YOUNG WOMAN
So, what exactly are you saying to
me.
MOTHER
(beat)
I’m saying, take the damn nightgown
to the basement. Live dangerously.
The Mother laughs again. The Young Woman nods, opens the
basement door. The stairs are rickety and it’s dark. There
is a bare bulb at the bottom of the stairs. She heads down.
61

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

61

The Young Woman makes her ways slowly down the dark,
makeshift staircase, the noise of a washer thumping angrily
through an unbalanced load fills the space.
JAKE (O.S.)
You sent her down?
MOTHER (O.S.)
To the washer.
JAKE (O.C.)
Mom, it’s really -(calling)
Lucy?
She looks up the stairs and sees Jake silhouetted in the
doorway.
JAKE (CONT'D)
You don’t have to do laundry for my
mother! You’re a guest! We’ll get
you a clean nightgown for tonight.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’ll just toss it in! I don’t mind!

Well, we should get on the road!

62

INT. FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

62

At the bottom, she looks back up; Jake is no longer in the
doorway, which now seems to lead directly outside to the
storm. Snow blows down the stairs. She turns to the room.
Dirt floors. Scarred concrete walls. An old washing machine
is bouncing and chugging. She opens the lid, watches the
dark, sloshing water come to a stop, the room turning silent,
aside from the howling wind. She stares down into the black
water. After a moment, she plunges her arm (sleeve and all)
into it, fishes around, and pulls out several dark green work
shirts featuring the name of a high school stitched above the
breast pocket, one after another. She puts them back, throws
in the nightgown, closes the lid. The agitator resumes. She
looks around the room. A small easel is set up in the corner
with a crude landscape painting on it. Taped to the wall
behind it are prints of the landscape paintings the Young
Woman had on her phone. Printing on the bottom of the white
borders indicate these are 19th century paintings by Isaac
Levitan. The painting on the easel is a terrible attempt to
copy one of the prints, unskilled, lifeless. She sees a pile
of paintings and flips through them; they are all miserable
attempts at copies. They are all signed “Jake.” She tries to
bring up her own paintings on her phone. They are gone. Her
phone rings again. It is from Louisa. She answers it.
MAN’S VOICE
There’s only one question to
resolve. I’m scared. I feel a
little crazy. I’m not lucid. The
assumptions are right. I can feel
my fear growing. Now is the time
for the answer. Just one question.
One question to answer
She hurries up the stairs.
63

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

63

The Young Woman, out of breath, emerges from the basement to
see Jake standing mournfully over his ancient mother, clearly
dead, lying on a hospital bed in the middle of the room.

78.
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh my God, Jake. Is your -Shh. She’s
She’s -- ?

JAKE
asleep.
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
We should go. It’s getting
treacherous.
YOUNG WOMAN
Are you certain she’s all right?
JAKE
Out like a light. A good time to
go.
YOUNG WOMAN
What about your Dad?
JAKE
He’s... puttering somewhere.
YOUNG WOMAN
Should we say goodbye?
The Father emerges from the kitchen, younger, holding a
spanner and an elbow joint.
FATHER
Disposal’s out again. It was sure
great to meet you though.
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh! Thank you. It was great to meet
you. Thank you so much for your
hospitality.
FATHER
You’re always welcome here.
That’s --

EXT. FARM HOUSE - CAR - NIGHT

Jake is laying out the chains while the Young Woman watches.
It’s windy and snowing hard.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m impressed you know how to do
such things.
JAKE
It’s no big deal.
YOUNG WOMAN
I guess I’m just not very
mechanically inclined.
JAKE
Everyone has their talent. You’re
more of an art -He stops himself, looks up at her.

Yes. That’s true.

Jake drives through the storm. She looks out at the night.
So?
What?

JAKE
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Did you like them?
YOUNG WOMAN
They’re very nice.

80.

Really?
Yes!

JAKE
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
They can be a little pushy. But
they’re basically decent people.
YOUNG WOMAN
That was eminently clear.
JAKE
Good.
(beat)
They loved you, by the way.
YOUNG WOMAN
Good. I’m glad.
JAKE
So smart, my mother said.
Did she?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Well, not to you. That would have
made you uncomfortable. When I was
helping her with the dishes.
Oh.

YOUNG WOMAN

She stares out at the storm.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I don’t remember Jake helping his
mother with the dishes. I feel
uncertain about a lot of what
happened tonight. It seems as if
everything was slightly -JAKE
When you and Dad were discussing -What was it?
YOUNG WOMAN
(suddenly recalling)
Tariffs.
JAKE
Right, tariffs.

81.
YOUNG WOMAN
I remember now. I’m a little fuzzy.
JAKE
You had a lot of wine. He was
thrilled to have someone who knew -Did I?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
You did. I don’t think you noticed,
because Dad kept topping you off.
Did he?
Oh, yes.

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Right. I did notice that. Tricky.
JAKE
Makes it hard to keep count.
It does.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
But all in all, I think it was a
successful visit.
Yes.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Everyone got to know each other.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s true. They’re very nice.
JAKE
You liked them?
YOUNG WOMAN
I did. Yes.
JAKE
Good. They both liked you. I think
that’s a good sign.
Sign?

YOUNG WOMAN

82.
JAKE
Sign is perhaps not the right word.
Thing. A good thing.
Oh.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
It’s good when people you like like
each other.
Jake looks over at her for confirmation. She nods without
back at him, watches the snow in the headlights.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
People think of themselves as
points moving through time, but I
think it’s probably the opposite,
we’re stationary and time passes
through us, blowing like cold wind,
stealing our heat, leaving us
chapped and frozen and -- I don’t
know -- dead. I feel like I was
that wind tonight, blowing through
Jake’s parents, seeing them as they
were, seeing them as they will be.
Seeing them after they’re gone,
when only I’m left. Only the wind.
JAKE
What are you thinking?
Not much.
Really?

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah. I’m tired, Jake. The wine, I
guess.
JAKE
You did have a lot.
Yes.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Alcohol is a depressant, as you
know. So -YOUNG WOMAN
Of course I know.

83.
JAKE
I think a person needs to keep that
in mind before making decisions
under its influence.
YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckling)
A woman under the influence.
JAKE
Amazing film.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not sure I agree. I’ve been
watching it over and over for my
essay due Wednesday.
JAKE
I mean, I felt a kinship with
Mabel, I guess. She’s such a
powerful and horribly wronged
character.
YOUNG WOMAN
Is she? Hmm. I think -(beat)
Mabel Longhetti is bombed out
because she has always wanted to
please everyone, so she can be
considered one more victim-heroine
for "women's liberation" -- but
only by women's liberationists who
are willing to accept textbook
spinoffs as art. The Junoesque Gena
Rowlands (Mrs. Cassavetes) is a
prodigious actress, and she never
lets go of the character.
JAKE
I agree. I thought she was great in
the role. It seemed to me she
encompassed this character as a
kind of spectrum of -YOUNG WOMAN
Now, at an indeterminate age when
her beauty has deepened beyond
ingénue roles, Rowlands can look
old or young, and shades of
expression transform Mabel
Longhetti from a radiantly
flirtatious beauty into a sad,
sagging neighborhood drunk.
(MORE)

84.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Rowlands externalizes schizophrenic
dissolution. Mabel fragments before
our eyes: a three-ring circus might
be taking place in her face.
Rowlands' performance is enough for
half a dozen tours de force, a
whole row of Oscars - it's
exhausting. Conceivably, she's a
great actress, but nothing she does
is memorable, because she does so
much.
(beat)
It's the most transient big
performance I've ever seen.
JAKE
I guess, I’m unclear what you mean
by ‘transient.”
The young woman considers this, then:
YOUNG WOMAN
Mabel tries to slash her wrist, and
Nick puts a Band-Aid on the cut:
the idiot symbolism may make you
want to hoot, but this two-hour-andthirty-five-minute film leaves you
too groggy to do more than moan.
Details that are meant to establish
the pathological nature of the
people around Mabel, and so show
her isolation, become instead limp,
false moments. We often can’t tell
whether the characters are meant to
be unconscious of what they’re
doing or whether it’s Cassavetes
who’s unconscious. Mabel’s children
keep murmuring that they love her,
and there are no clues to how to
decipher this refrain. Are the
children coddling her-reversing
roles and treating her like a child
in need of reassurance? Or are they
meant to be as unashamedly loving
as she is? And what are we to make
of Nick the pulper’s constant
assertations -JAKE
Is assertations even a word?
thought it was assertions.

I

85.
YOUNG WOMAN
It is. They’re both words. Look it
up.
(continuing)
And what are we to make of Nick the
pulper’s assertations of love? The
movie is entirely tendentious; it’s
all planned, yet it isn’t thought
out.
Jake seems embarrassed. How could he have liked this film?
JAKE
I do see what you’re saying. And
you’re certainly the expert on
things cinematic.
The Young Woman seems blurry, confused, somewhat startled by
her long-winded assessment of the movie.
Yeah.

YOUNG WOMAN
That I am.

JAKE
I guess I was just taken in by the
sympathy Cassavetes showed for her.
I feel like maybe our society lacks
a certain kindness, a willingness
to take in the vulnerabilities and
struggles of others... struggling
with issues caused by...
YOUNG WOMAN
An alienating society?
JAKE
I don’t know. I guess, yeah.
seems hopeless.
What does?

It

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Everything? It’s like, feeling old,
like, your body is going, your
hearing, your sight. You can’t see
and you’re invisible, and you made
so many wrong turns. The lie of it
all.
YOUNG WOMAN
What’s the lie of it all?

White Prod. (02/21/19)
JAKE
I don’t know. That things are
going to get better. That it’s
never too late. That good things
come to those who wait. That God
has a plan for you. That age is
just a number. That it’s always
darkest before the dawn. That every
cloud has a silver lining.

That there’s someone for everyone.

That God never gives us more than
we can bear.

Didn’t we have dessert at your
mom’s? I feel like there was some
huge cake-thing she brought out and

True. I guess I’m a sugar junkie.

No! She was lovely. She really was.
JAKE
Yeah. I don’t subscribe to that
“the mother is cause of all
psychological problems” crap.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s misogynistic claptrap.
Freudian bullshit.
JAKE
Yeah. It’s tempting to have someone
to pin it on, though.
YOUNG WOMAN
Pin what on?
JAKE
All of it. I don’t know. Why you
feel a certain way, why you are a
certain way.
YOUNG WOMAN
But it’s misogynistic claptrap.
Freudian bullshit. A person, an

responsibility for who they are,
what they’ve become. Don’t you

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Yet at one time or another in the
20th century every fucking
childhood trait was blamed on them:
schizophrenia, autism, narcissism,
homosexuality.
JAKE
Not that homosexuality is akin to
any of those other things.
YOUNG WOMAN
Of course not.
JAKE
Saying that a mother is “to blame”
for her child’s homosexuality is to
imply that homosexuality is somehow
negative.
YOUNG WOMAN
Of course. And I didn’t mean that.
But when homosexuality was
considered a pathology, in the DSM,
before 1973, a coddling mother was
often seen as the culprit.
JAKE
Right. It’s despicable how we label
people, categorize them, dismiss
them. I look at the kids I see at
school every day. I see the ones
who are ostracized. They’re
different, out of step. I see the
lives they’ll have because of it.
Sometimes I see them years later,
in town or at the supermarket. I
can tell they still carry that
stuff around with them. Like a
black aura. A mill stone. An

So Ice takes place during an

caused the world to become a frozen

sees he is unable to speak. The girls snicker.

watches them, waiting, confused.

The Young Woman glances over at Jake. He’s looking at the
haunted girl’s exposed arms, which are covered with an eczematype rash. The Young Woman follows his look and sees the
rash, too. The girl scratches mercilessly at her rash as she
makes the B-r-r-r's.

Ha. Thanks a lot.
T.T. GIRL 3
(on the verge of tears)
I didn’t mean it like that.

T.T. GIRL 3 (CONT'D)
I love the way you look. You have a
kindness. And of course you’re very
attractive. I didn’t mean it like
that.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s ok. I understand.
T.T. GIRL 3
I didn’t mean it like that. It’s
just that there seems to be a
certain... hardness that comes with
a certain kind of pretty. You don’t
have that. Maybe they suffer, too,
the pretty ones. I don’t know.
Maybe their prettiness causes them
suffering. I’m not a psychiatrist.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
What an odd thing to say. Of course
she’s not a psychiatrist. She can’t
be more than fifteen.
T.T. GIRL 3 holds the piled-high B-r-r-r's upside down, then
places them right side up on the counter.
T.T. GIRL 3
I made them extra high. Because
you’re so nice.
(beat)
That’ll be eight dollars, please.
Jake hands her a ten. The Young Woman notices that Jake has a
similar rash on his hand. Tulsey Town Girl 3, puts the money
in the register and gives the change to the Young Woman.
YOUNG WOMAN
You keep the change.
T.T. GIRL 3
(to Young Woman)
Thank you.
YOUNG WOMAN
You’re welcome. Thank you.
T.T. GIRL 3
I’m worried.
The Young Woman looks around, confused. No one else is paying
attention. The other girls are giggling. Jake is at the door,
looking at the storm.

White Prod. (02/21/19)

Excuse me?

95.
YOUNG WOMAN

T.T. GIRL 3
I shouldn’t be saying this. I know
what happens. It’s not good.
YOUNG WOMAN
(looking at other girls)
Are you ok? Do you need me to call
for help?
T.T. GIRL 3
It’s not varnish. That’s not why it
smells. You should know that.
YOUNG WOMAN
What do you mean?
T.T. GIRL 3
You don’t have to go.
The other two employees are whispering and giggling.
YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t have to go where?
T.T. GIRL 3
Forward. In time. You don’t have
to. You can stay here.
(beat)
I’m very scared.
YOUNG WOMAN
Of what? What are you scared of?
T.T. GIRL 3
I’m scared for you.
Jake looks over. T.T. Girl 3 changes her tone.
T.T. GIRL 3 (CONT'D)
Have a good night. Be careful out
there. The roads are treacherous.
67pt.1 INT. CAR - NIGHT

67pt.1

Jake drives. They pick at their B-r-r-r's..
Any good?

JAKE

96.

Yeah.

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s fine. It’s good.

They eat in silence.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Did you notice that girl’s arms?
JAKE
Which girl?
YOUNG WOMAN
At the Tulsey Town.
JAKE
(containing impatience)
Which girl. There were several.
YOUNG WOMAN
Several? There were three.
JAKE
(beat)
Several is anything more than two.
Really?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Look it up.
YOUNG WOMAN
Look it up? Now? Will you stop
saying that? Anyway, the skinny
one.
JAKE
Weren’t they all skinny?
YOUNG WOMAN
You are being willfully obtuse.
JAKE
Not my intention.
YOUNG WOMAN
(mockingly)
Not my intention.
(angry)
The one with the rash all over her
arms!

White Prod. (02/21/19)

97.

JAKE
(beat)
I didn’t notice.
Silence.
YOUNG WOMAN
Ok. Anyway...
Silence.
JAKE
How’s the Burr?

Too sweet?

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s sweet, yes. But it’s good.
Jake has placed his B-r-r-r in the cup holder.
JAKE
I always forget how sweet these
are. A little goes a long way. I
don’t think I can eat any more of
mine.
YOUNG WOMAN
You barely touched it.
JAKE
It’s very sweet.
Silence.
YOUNG WOMAN
It is a lot.
She turns up the heat.
Cold?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Probably the ice cream.
JAKE
And we’re in a snowstorm. Whose
idea was it to go to Tulsey Town in
the middle of this, anyway?
She looks over at him.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not saying a word.

It’s melting.

98.
They both laugh. She looks out at the storm, which has an
otherworldly quality to it.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
How odd. This is probably the last
time I’ll ever be in a car with
Jake. Soon this will all be a
distant memory. We’ll both be in
different places, remembering this
moment, this shared laugh. And
maybe there’ll be regret. Maybe
time will soften the harder edges
and we’ll both think, that was sort
of nice. Why did it have to end?
And there’s no way back at that
point. There’s never a way back.
Maybe it doesn’t need to end. Why
am I putting so much pressure on
this to be some bullshit out of a
movie? Maybe I will eventually fall
in love with Jake. Maybe it will
get better. Relationships take
effort. Anyone in a successful
relationship will always tell you -JAKE
You got quiet all of a sudden.
Penny?
YOUNG WOMAN
Just watching the storm.
Huh.

JAKE

Silence.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
But if you can’t even tell the
other person what you’re thinking,
that doesn’t bode well.
Jake looks back and forth several times from the road to the
Young Woman, trying to read her mood. She stares straight
ahead, watching the storm in the headlights.
JAKE
Looks like you’re done with it.
YOUNG WOMAN
(looking at him)
What do you mean?

White Prod. (02/21/19)

99.

He gestures to the two B-r-r-r's sitting in the cup holders
and melting down their sides.
Me, too.

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m a little cold, I guess.
JAKE
A bit of a wasted stop.
YOUNG WOMAN
At least I can say I’ve been to a
Tulsey Town in the middle of
nowhere in the middle of the night
in the middle of a snowstorm.
JAKE
(singing)
I’m your favorite clown/from Tulsey
Town/where ice cream grows on
trees/So have no fear/come and join
me here/and eat as much as you
please/I will turn your frown/fully
upside down/when you take your very
first bite/of vanilla, chocolate,
or strawberry/We’re open day and
night!
YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckles)
And it’s something I’ll never do
again.
JAKE
A Supposedly Fun Thing You’ll Never
Do Again.
YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. Exactly.
JAKE
Have you read that?
Read what?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
It’s a book of essays by David
Foster Wallace.
YOUNG WOMAN
I have not.

100.
JAKE
A book of essays.
YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh. No. I haven’t read it.
JAKE
We should find a place to dump
these. They’re going to melt and
get the cup holders all sticky.
Um. Ok.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
He’s got an essay in it about
television. “One of the things that
makes the people on TV fit to stand
the mega-gaze is that they are, by
human standards, really pretty. I
suspect that this, like most
television conventions, is set up
with motive no more sinister than
to appeal to the largest possible
Audience. Pretty people tend to be
more pleasing to look at then nonpretty people. But when we’re
talking about television, the
combination of sheer Audience size
and quiet psychic intercourse
between images and oglers starts a
cycle that both enhances pretty
images’ appeal and erodes us
viewers’ own security in the face
of gazes. Because of the way humans
relate to narrative, we tend to
identify with those characters we
find appealing. We try to see
ourselves in them. The same I.D.relation, however, also means that
we try to see them in ourselves.
When everybody we seek to identify
with for six hours a day is pretty,
it naturally becomes more important
for us to be pretty, to be viewed
as pretty.”
(beat)
That’s from the essay.
Huh.

YOUNG WOMAN

101.
JAKE
There’s a lot more, but I won’t
bore you.
YOUNG WOMAN
It’s interesting. Kinda longwinded.
JAKE
He killed himself.
YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. I think I knew that.
JAKE
Everybody knows it. Even people who
know nothing else about David
Foster Wallace, have never read a
word of his writing. Suicide
becomes the story. The mythology.
The cautionary tale. It’s
obnoxious. Other people’s suffering
turned into stories. They made a
movie about him. Based on a
bestselling book, published two
years after he killed himself.
Huh.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Neither of which would have existed
had he not killed himself.
Yeah.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
I don’t think we know how to be
human anymore.
YOUNG WOMAN
Who doesn’t?
JAKE
Our society. Our culture. People.
Whatever all this is. Any of us.
YOUNG WOMAN
Have you ever read any Guy DeBord?
The Society of the Spectacle?
JAKE
Exactly! Yes! Of course!

102.
YOUNG WOMAN
DeBord says, “The society cannot be
understood as a mere visual
deception produced by mass-media
technologies. It is a worldview
that has actually been
materialized.”
JAKE
Exactly. We watch the world
through this glass, pre-interpreted
for us. It infects our brains. We
become it.
A virus.

YOUNG WOMAN

Silence.
JAKE
Listen, these melting things are
driving me crazy. It’s going to
get everything all sticky.
YOUNG WOMAN
Do you have a plastic bag I can put
them in? Some napkins, maybe?
JAKE
No. Nothing like that. I want to
find some place to dump them.
YOUNG WOMAN
There doesn’t seem to be anything
around here.
JAKE
There’s a small road up ahead I
know of. There’ll be a garbage can.
YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t know. Maybe we should just
head home.
JAKE
(confused)
To the farm?
YOUNG WOMAN
What? No. To the city. I’m worried
about getting stuck out here. If we
turn off the main road and get
stuck, no one will find us.

103.
JAKE
Yeah. True.
Silence.
JAKE (CONT'D)
I’m just not going to feel right if
I don’t get rid of these. It’ll
prey on my mind. Shit. I should’ve
brought napkins. And a plastic bag.
Like you said. That was really
stupid. A plastic bag would’ve
solved everything.
YOUNG WOMAN
Not everything.
Jake pounds at the steering wheel. The Young Woman watches.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
It’s not a big deal. Really.
JAKE
Yes. I know that, Ames.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
Ames? Is that short for Amy? That
doesn’t sound right. That doesn’t
seem like my name. Or my nickname.
JAKE
Just let’s go here real quick.
Jake turns off onto a narrow dirt road -- almost a path -bordered by tall dark trees.
JAKE (CONT'D)
And I’ll get to show you my high
school.
YOUNG WOMAN
This goes to a high school?
JAKE
Yes. My high school. Where I went
every tortured day for so long. So
goddamn long.
(beat)
I did not like high school.
YOUNG WOMAN
(worried)
No one did, really.

104.
JAKE
That’s what they tell me. I am told
that.
It’s true.

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
I see people who seem to thrive
there.
YOUNG WOMAN
This road goes to a high school?
Yeah. Why?

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t know. It seems so -- It
doesn’t seem like a road at all.
JAKE
What does it seem like?
YOUNG WOMAN
Hmm. A path? A trail?
The road less travelled?
JAKE
Well, it is a bit Frosty out.
YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckling)
Fired.
JAKE
Just trying to lighten the mood.
YOUNG WOMAN
And that has made all the
difference.
JAKE
(chuckling)
Now who’s fired?
Silence.
YOUNG WOMAN
I do feel uneasy, Jake. I think we
should turn back. It doesn’t feel
right.

105.
JAKE
It’s just a high school.
YOUNG WOMAN
It feels wrong.
JAKE
Anyway, I can’t turn around. The
road’s too narrow. I’ll just get to
the school, dump the cups, and
we’ll leave.
Ok.
Good.

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
I just don’t really get this. This
road makes no sense to me. How do
school buses get down here?
JAKE
It’s a rural high school.
YOUNG WOMAN
Jake, I grew up on a farm. I went
to a rural high school. We had a
normal entrance with a paved road.
JAKE
It’s fine. It’ll be fine.
Everything is tinged. That’s the
thing you have to realize.
Tinged?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Colored. By mood. By emotion. By
past experience. There is no
objective reality. You know there
is no color in the universe, right?
Only in our brains. Just
electromagnetic frequencies. The
brain tinges them.
YOUNG WOMAN
I’m a physicist. I know what color
is.
JAKE
Yes. You are. You do.

106.
YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
Colors are the deeds of light, its
deeds and suffering.
JAKE
That’s beautiful. Not physicist
talk, but eminently poetic.
YOUNG WOMAN
Well, I am a poet, after all.
JAKE
Yes, you are. It’s beautiful.
YOUNG WOMAN
This road seems excessively long.
JAKE
Seems. That’s the operative word.
Time, another thing that exists
only in the brain.
YOUNG WOMAN
And yet we get older.
JAKE
Older and older. Or so it seems.
Sometimes I feel I am much younger
than I actually am. Like still a
kid inside. Until I pass a mirror.
YOUNG WOMAN
Is younger better?

Yes.

JAKE
(quickly, confidently)

(beat)
I think so. It’s admirable.
YOUNG WOMAN
Youth is admirable? How can you
admire a person for their age?
It’d be like admiring a specific
point in a stream.
JAKE
It’s healthier, brighter... more
fun. More attractive. Hopeful.
YOUNG WOMAN
Like a Coca Cola commercial!

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

JAKE
Almost all ground-breaking work in
science, in the arts, is done by
young people. Old people are the
ash heap of youth.
YOUNG WOMAN
Listen, Jake, I’m thinking we need
to end -Tah-dah.

JAKE

67pt.2 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
The road has opened up to reveal a large high school.
the high school in which the Janitor works.

67pt.2
It is

YOUNG WOMAN
Wow. I wasn’t expecting anything so
enormous.
JAKE
130 classroom, a gymnasium, 2
locker rooms -- boys, girls -auditorium, 10 bathrooms, 6
administrative offices, teacher
lounge, counseling center, nurse’s
office. It’s regional, so 11 towns
feed into it.
YOUNG WOMAN
You certainly know your high
school.
JAKE
Like the back of my hand.
68

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Jake pulls into the parking lot. It’s empty, except for
the Janitor’s truck.
YOUNG WOMAN
There’s someone here. That’s weird.
JAKE
School maintenance? Janitor.
Something.
(looking)
There!

What?

YOUNG WOMAN

108.
JAKE
Trash can. I knew it.
(grabbing cups)
I’ll be right back.
He opens his door, exits the car, slams the door. The Young
Woman starts at the violence of the slam. She watches Jake as
he trudges, struggling against the wind, toward the
receptacle. It’s slow going. Snow falls on the windshield,
obscuring Jake. Then he is revealed again by the scraping
windshield wipers. Obscured, revealed, obscured revealed. He
arrives at the bin, opens the lid and just stands there,
peering in.
YOUNG WOMAN
What is he doing? Jake, c’mon,
let’s go.
She glances over at the pick-up truck. Jake places the lid
back on; he’s still holding the cups.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing?? Argh!
He looks toward the car, holds one finger up to indicate “one
minute,” and trudges off, disappearing behind the school.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
What?? Jesus, Jake.
She reaches over to the driver’s side and locks the car
doors, looks behind her into the blackness. She glances at
the truck, somehow made sinister by the lot’s sodium vapor
lamps.
Ugh.

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)

For a long while, she watches the corner around which Jake
has disappeared. She seems to be willing him to reappear.
Eventually he does.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Yes! Let’s go let’s go let’s go
let’s go...
He waves and trudges toward the car: obscured, revealed,
obscured, revealed. He arrives at the car, opens the door.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Where were you?!
Jake gets in, closes the door. He is covered in snow, out of
breath.

109.
JAKE
Sorry. Sorry. That bin was filled
with road salt. For the ice. I
remembered there was a dumpster on
the other side, near the loading
dock. So... mission accomplished.
YOUNG WOMAN
Good. Let’s go.
JAKE
It’s humid in here.
His glasses are fogged. He turns the ignition key; the engine
stops.
JAKE (CONT'D)
There.
(beat)
Kind of peaceful, no?
YOUNG WOMAN
More creepy than peaceful, I’d say.
JAKE
I don’t agree.
YOUNG WOMAN
I want to go.
JAKE
What’s the rush all of a sudden?
YOUNG WOMAN
All of a sudden? All night I’ve
been a broken record about getting
home. I’ve given you, like, forty
reasons I need to get home tonight.
JAKE
I guess that’s true.
You guess?

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
I just thought, you know, since
it’s peaceful and quiet here and,
Baby, it’s cold outside -YOUNG WOMAN
Really? You’re going to quote a
rape song at me to convince me to --

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

110.

JAKE
It’s not a rape song.
YOUNG WOMAN
She keeps saying she wants to
leave. He keeps ignoring her. What
would you call that?
JAKE
She wants to stay. She’s just
afraid of what people will think.
YOUNG WOMAN
She asks him “What did you put in
my damn drink?”
JAKE
Jesus, the song was written in
1936. It’s not about roofies.
YOUNG WOMAN
Roofies or not, he’s trying to
break down her defenses with strong
liquor. And, anyway, I’m sorry,
but they had mickeys in the
thirties. It’s a song about
coercion.
JAKE
Why are you getting so angry?
YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
I just want to go home.
JAKE
To the farmhouse?
YOUNG WOMAN
No! Not to the fucking farmhouse.
To my house, Jake! To my house!
Ok, ok.

JAKE

He turns the ignition key. The car starts. He waits for the
wipers to clear the snow from the windshield.
Thank you.

110A.

111.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Regardless of her own desires.
That’s not her responsibility.
JAKE
I see that. You’ve convinced me.
I’m sorry.
He leans over to give her a conciliatory kiss, which she
accepts. The kiss turns a bit romantic. Jake suddenly pulls
away.
Jesus!
What??

JAKE (CONT'D)
YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
In the window!
YOUNG WOMAN
(looking toward school)
What??
JAKE
There was someone watching us.
YOUNG WOMAN
(scanning windows)
I don’t see anyone.
JAKE
He was there. Watching us. Like a
goddamn pervert.
YOUNG WOMAN
Let’s go. Maybe he was just looking
out the window, wondering what our
car was doing here in the middle of
the night.
JAKE
Believe me, I am very familiar with
that particular look.
YOUNG WOMAN
What does that mean?
JAKE
I’m going to give him a piece of my
mind is what it means. That is not
acceptable.

112.
YOUNG WOMAN
Jake, really, let’s just -Jake turns off the car, opens the door and exits car.
JAKE
I’ll be right back. This is not
acceptable.
Jake!
At all!

YOUNG WOMAN
JAKE

He slams the door and is gone, running toward the school.
The Young Woman shivers, looks at the ignition. The key is
missing.
Crap.

YOUNG WOMAN

She sits there, shivering, watching Jake recede. Soon he is
around the corner and gone. The Young Woman watches the
school, turns and looks back at the road, settles back into
her seat, puts her hands in her pockets and waits.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
This was a mistake. I shouldn’t
have come. I knew things between
Jake and me were not going to work
out. I think, if I’m honest, I knew
from our very first conversation.
There was something. Something
needling. In the back of my brain.
Some little voice whispering, this
isn’t right. This isn’t for you.
Turn back. But it’s hard to say no.
I was never taught that. It’s
easier to say ok. It’s smoother.
Feathers don’t get ruffled. People
don’t get hurt. And, anyway,
sometimes you’re caught off-guard.
The request comes, can I have your
number. And the easiest way out is
to say yes. And that yes leads to
the next yes and then more yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes and then you
find yourself in a relationship.
And it’s too late to say no, or at
least it has become much harder.
Because you don’t have a good
reason. He’s not a monster. He
doesn’t beat you.
(MORE)

113.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He’s a nice guy and now you need a
reason. But you fantasize about
being rid of it, the whole thing.
And none of it is fair to him, this
constant unspoken pulling away. And
you should’ve just said no thank
you in the first place. But he’s a
nice guy and I imagine we’ve had
some fun. I’m sure we have. I’m
certain we’ve laughed. I’m certain
the sex has been good, at least
some of the time. It has to have
been, although right now I have
very little actual memory of it.
Right now the whole thing seems
vague. All this time together and I
can’t feel it. Where did it go?
(trying to see through
windshield)
Where did Jake go?
The windshield is obscured; she opens the door, pokes her
head out, looks into the distance, searching for his figure
amidst the swirling snow. She gets back in, closes the door,
locks it.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
I’m so cold. Where is he? And how
long does it take to get
hypothermia? Maybe it’s not a bad
way to go, if you have to go.
Numbness has its advantages.
Sometimes it’s the only way to get
through. Just turn it all off, all
the damn signals to the brain, all
the noise, all the time.
(beat)
Slow it down.
(beat)
Slow it, slow it, until it all just
stops.
The Young Woman sits there in silence, shivering, staring at
the quiet school.
YOUNG WOMAN
Jesus, Jake. C’mon.
She sighs, opens the car door, exits, closes the door,
immediately realizes, tries the door, it’s locked behind her.
Shit.

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Shit.

Yellow Rev. (03/12/19)

114.

She tries all the other doors. All locked.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
Shit shit shit.
She looks at the school, heads toward it. As she walks, she
stares up at the school’s darkened windows, she looks behind
her, she looks at the pick-up truck in the parking lot. She
feels she’s being watched through every black rectangle. She
becomes self-conscious, and, incongruously, as she walks
through the snow and wind, she attempts to fix her blowing
hair. She rounds the corner and sees the dumpster Jake had
mentioned. She approaches it, opens the lid. It is filled
with hundreds of half-eaten B-r-r-r's. The Young Woman is
startled, jumps back, the lid slams closed with a metal clang
that echoes off the building. She makes her way to the
school’s glass front doors, peers in: a long, dim, empty
hallway. She doesn’t know what to do, she’s scared to go in;
she’s too cold to stay outside. She rests her forehead
against the glass of the door for a long moment.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
(to herself)
Jake. Please.
She girds herself, enters the building.
69

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

69

The Young Woman walks cautiously down the hall. The shot
mirrors the initial shot of the Janitor walking the same
hall.
YOUNG WOMAN
(quietly)
Jake?
The Janitor appears in the distance at the end of the hall
where it intersects with another. He is mopping, seems
unaware of her. She gasps and hides in a doorway. Breathing
hard, she peeks back down the hall; the Janitor is gone.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Jake, I want to go. Please.
She steps back out into the hall. The Janitor appears again
in the intersecting hall, now mopping in the other direction.
Again, the Young Woman jumps back into the doorway.

*

115.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
What am I doing here? This entire
night makes no sense. I’ve lost
myself in all of this, in this
relationship, in this world of
Jake. How is it one always finds
oneself in a foreign country in
relationships. In the land of Jake.
We treat you right.
(looking toward entrance)
Maybe he’s back out in the car?
Can he have passed without me
seeing him? I don’t think so. He
has to be in here somewhere. And
even if he is out there, he
wouldn’t leave without me. He’d
come looking for me. I’ll wait, in
the warmth, out of sight. Watching.
For Jake. Is it possible that the
janitor guy has done something to
him? Hurt him somehow? If he’s hurt
Jake -- killed him, even -- what
chance is there for me? I’ll just
wait. Till morning, if I have to.
Till the school opens.
(beat)
Unless it’s a snow day. It’s going
to be a snow day tomorrow, isn’t
it? Of course it is. It’s going to
be a snow day tomorrow and nobody
is coming. Shit. Jake. Ok. Still.
In daylight I can walk to the road.
There’ll be somebody. A snowplow. A
cop. I’ll just sit tight. Unseen.
She peeks down the hall.
The hall is now seen from the Janitor’s POV. He has spotted
the Young Woman’s head poking out. She sees him, pulls out of
sight. He mops toward her, slow, methodically, deliberately,
mumbling to himself. The mumbling, for the first time can
partially be made out.
JANITOR
Don’t... Don’t... You can’t...
The Janitor continues toward her, drawn like a magnet.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
Don’t... No... Mustn’t...
He arrives at the doorway in which she hides. He stops,
seemingly unable to make the final step to see her. Her
breathing is audible.

116.
Finally, he pokes his head around the locker. She is looking
at him (at us), no recognition on her face.
YOUNG WOMAN
Oh. Hello. I’m sorry. My
boyfriend... I think he came in
here. I think he went to school
here. A while back. So maybe you
know him. I don’t know if you were
here when he was a student. How
would I know? Anyway, I’m locked
out of his car. So I came in
looking for him -- I hope that’s ok
-- But I didn’t see him. So I’m
waiting here, but I can go if
that’s not all right. You haven’t
seen anyone in here, by any chance,
have you? I’m a little worried.
You haven’t seen him, have you?
Silence. Then:
JANITOR
What does your boyfriend look like?
YOUNG WOMAN
Um, It’s so hard to describe
people. Anyway, it’s so long ago.
I barely remember. We never even
talked, is the truth. I’m not sure
I even registered him. There were a
lot of people. I was there with my
girlfriend. She and I were
celebrating our anniversary.
Stopped in for a drink and this guy
kept looking over at me. It’s a
nuisance. The occupational hazard
of being female. You can’t even go
out for a drink. Always being
looked at. A creeper, you know. I
remember thinking, I wish my
boyfriend were here, which is sort
of sad, that if you’re a woman,
guys don’t leave you alone unless
you’re with another guy, like
you’ve been claimed, like you’re
property. Even then, not always.
Anyway, I can’t remember what he
looked like. Why would I? Nothing
happened. He was just one of
thousands of such non-interactions
in my life.

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
It’s like asking me if I can
describe the mosquito that bit me
on a certain evening forty years
ago.
(beat)
So have you seen someone fitting
that description.
JANITOR
I haven’t seen anyone.
YOUNG WOMAN

Ok.

JANITOR
I mean, other than you. I see you.
YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
I’m worried about him.
JANITOR
I’m sure there’s no need. He’s safe
if he’s here. It’s safe in here.
Quiet.

Ok.

YOUNG WOMAN
(studies his face)

(beat)
Is it ok, if I look around for him?
JANITOR
Maybe take your wet shoes off. I’ve
just cleaned the floors.
Thanks.

YOUNG WOMAN

The Young Woman takes off her shoes. The Janitor watches, her
feet now in the big blue slippers. She smiles back at him
briefly, sadly.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)

Bye.
Yeah. Bye.

JANITOR

The Young Woman pads silently down the hall, her voice
receding.
Jake?

YOUNG WOMAN
Jake? Jake?

118.
The Janitor mops up the small puddles left by the Young
Woman’s shoes.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

70

The Young Woman arrives at the hall intersection, stands
still and looks down it. Jake is in the distance looking at
her. A Second Young Woman, dressed identically to the Young
Woman, emerges from another classroom doorway and stands
behind her. A Young Man dressed as Jake emerges and stands
behind Jake. The real Jake and Young Woman back away leaving
only their replacements. Eerie, burbling orchestral music
begins, vague and poorly remembered. The two replacements
wave and hurry toward each other in a balletic run. They meet
in the middle of the hall and embrace. “Jake” spins “Young
Woman” around, lifts her, and the two perform a pas de deux
expressing their love. The real Jake watches, profoundly
moved, and the real Young Woman looks perplexed and anxious.
The dance continues as a wedding ceremony is performed and
the “Young Woman” walks down the school hall towards “Jake”
and a “Minister.” The Janitor appears, intercepts the “Young
Woman” and pulls her away from the ceremony. She escapes
down a surreal, dark hall, and ends up “outside” in a
stylized version of the school exterior, struggling against
the snow and wind, the Janitor in pursuit. He grabs her and
she fights to disengage. “Jake” appears in the storm, and
the Janitor and “Jake” engage in a balletic fight, ending
when the Janitor pulls out a knife and stabs “Jake,” leaving
him to die on the ground, with bright red silk scarves
spilling out around him on the snow. The Janitor grabs the
“Young Woman” and carries her away, leaving the actual Young
Woman, Jake, and dying “Jake.” Jake and the Young Woman look
at each other with resignation and walk off into the storm in
opposite directions, soon becoming obscured by the blowing
snow.
The Janitor’s POV, through which all this has been
experienced: He wheels his cart toward the body of “Jake,”
lifts it, places it and the red scarves in the trash
receptacle on the cart, and wheels it off.
71

INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

71

Various shot of the Janitor cleaning, now in silence,
punctuated by the occasional distant call of “Jake?” These
become fewer and farther between, and even more distant.
Eventually the calls cease.
72

INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET - NIGHT

72

The Janitor, changes his shirt, collects his thermos, puts on
his jacket.

EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

119.
73

The Janitor trudges toward his truck in the empty parking
lot. The truck is covered with snow. He glances over to
where Jake’s car had been parked; it is gone. He unlocks the
truck’s door, dumps his stuff on the passenger seat, pulls
out a scraper, brushes the snow off his windows, gets in the
truck, closes the door.
74

INT TRUCK - NIGHT

74

The Janitor pulls his ignition key from his pocket, brings it
to the ignition, hesitates, doesn’t insert it, puts it back
in his pocket, watches the snow fall. Gradually, it begins to
fall in a sort of time-lapse loop, otherworldly. The
windshield gets covered with a thin layer of snow, still
allowing the light from the parking lot through, casting the
inside of the cab into yellow dimness. The Janitor shivers.
The cab gets darker as more snow accumulates. His shivering
becomes more violent, turns into a jerky timelapse. He rips
off his gloves, his hat, wipes his brow. With thick, now
clumsy hands, struggles to unbutton his shirt, succeeds,
tears it off. Pulls off his boots, his socks, his pants, his
underwear. He is now naked in the ever dimming cab. The snowcovered windshield begins to sizzle and percolate like TV
screen “snow.” This jitteriness turns to maggots, which fall
away to reveal a suffering pig, who turns his head and
acknowledges the Janitor with sorrowful eyes. The pig turns
away and walks slowly toward the school. He looks back at
the Janitor, urging him to follow. The Janitor gets out of
the truck and walks, naked, behind the pig. His body shakes
with cold.
75

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

75

The Janitor follows the pig, who, on occasion, looks back as
he walks. The pig talks to the Janitor.
PIG
It’s not bad. Once you stop feeling
sorry for yourself because you’re
just a pig, or, even worse, a pig
infested with maggots. Someone has
to be a pig infested with maggots,
right? It might as well be you.
It’s the luck of the draw. You play
the hand you’re dealt. You make
lemonade. You move on. You don’t
worry about a thing.

JANITOR
That song has always made me cry.
PIG
I’ve always loved it. There is
kindness in the world, y’know? You
have to search for it, but it’s
there.
JANITOR
You’re kind.
PIG
Eh. I’m just evolving. Even now,
even as a ghost, as a memory, as
dust. As you will.
JANITOR
We’re the same?
PIG
Everything is the same. When you
look close enough. As a physicist,
you would know that. You, me,
ideas. We’re all one thing. Let’s
get you dressed.
JANITOR
But I’m so hot.
PIG
Heat, cold. Variations on a theme.
It’s not important.
The pig leads the Janitor, now dressed in tails into the
auditorium, a Nobel medallion around his neck..
76

INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

76

The Janitor steps onto the stage. The Oklahoma! set is there,
looking very much like Jake’s farmhouse. His mother, the
young version, dressed like Aunt Eller, in grease paint old
age make-up, sits in a rocking chair on the porch of the
house. She smiles at him. The Janitor looks from her to the
audience, which is filled with high school students, now
dressed in tuxes and gowns. They applaud enthusiastically.
The Young Woman, also in old age grease paint, is in the
audience, too, smiling up lovingly at him. His Father, the
Tulsey Town girls, Jake, all there.
JANITOR
Thank you. My acceptance speech:

JANITOR (CONT'D)
I accept. I accept it all. I
gratefully accept your
acknowledgement, this award. I
accept all that it entails. That
this award comes near the end of a
long, fruitful life in
acknowledgement for the work I did
decades ago. My quest has taken me
through the physical -In the audience young Jake mouths along with this.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
-- the metaphysical, the delusional
-- and back. And I have made the
most important discovery of my
life: It is only in the mysterious
equations of love -In the audience, the Young Woman watches adoringly.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
-- that any logic or reasons can be
found. I am only here tonight
because of you. You are the reason
I am. You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
The Young Woman is moved to tears. The Janitor sings, now
dressed like a farmer. A stage set of a shack interior is
rolled in behind him. It bears a striking resemblance to
Jake’s bedroom.

122.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
The floor creaks,/the door
squeaks,/there’s a field mouse anibblin on a broom/And I sit by
myself/Like a cobweb on a shelf/By
myself in a lonely room/But when
there’s a moon in my winder/And it
slants down a beam crost my
bed/Then the shadder of a
tree/starts a-dancin on the
wall/And a dream starts a dancin in
my head/And all the things I wish
fer/Turn out like I wanted them to
be/And all the things I wish
fer/Turn out like I want them to
be/And I’m better’n that smart
aleck cowhand/Who thinks he’s
better’n me!/And The girl that I
want/Ain’t afraid of my arms/And
her own soft arms keep me warm/And
her long tangled hair falls a-crost
my face,/Jist like the rain in a
storm!/The Floor creaks, the door
squeaks/And the field mouse starts
a-nibblin on the broom/And the sun
flicks my eyes/It was all a pack of
lies!/I’m awake in a lonely room/I
ain’t gonna dream about her no
more!/I Ain’t gonna leave her
alone/Goin’ outside,/Git myself a
bride/Git me a woman to call my
own.
The Janitor finishes and is met with passionate, extended
applause. He stands there for an uncomfortably long time,
taking it in.
77

EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

77

The storm has stopped. Silence. The sun is shining. The
ground is covered in drifts of snow. In the empty parking
lot, sits the Janitor’s pick-up, a white truck-shaped lump of
snow.
