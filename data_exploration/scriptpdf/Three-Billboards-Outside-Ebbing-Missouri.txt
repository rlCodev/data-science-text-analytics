EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

1

MILDRED HAYES, a woman in her early 50’s, driving along a
country road, passes an old billboard, roadside. Whatever
advert was on it is long since faded and torn. MILDRED drives
on, to a second billboard a few hundred feet along the road.
She notices this one a little more, though its old adverts
are equally ramshackle. She slows to a stop.
After looking up at the billboard a while, she slowly
reverses and stops at the first, then at all three,
stretching away to the quiet horizon.
Makes a mental note of “EBBING BILLBOARD ADVERTISING”, then
drives on again, leaving the three old billboards alone like
tombstones on the dusty road.

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - EBBING ADVERTISING - DAY

2

RED WELBY’s office, window looking onto MAIN STREET and the
town’s POLICE STATION. RED, a cool-looking young guy,
pretends to read a Penguin Classic as he observes the office
hottie, PAMELA, pass in a cute dress. MILDRED strides on in.
MILDRED
You Red Welby?
RED
Yes, ma’am. How may I...?
MILDRED
They said those three billboards out on
Drinkwater Road, you’re in charge of
renting them out, that right?
RED
I didn’t know we had any billboards out
on... Where is Drinkwater Road?
MILDRED
Road out past the Sizemore turn-off noone uses since the highway got put in.
RED checks a file. MILDRED observes a beetle on its back on
the windowsill, trying to right itself.
RED
You’re right. Got three billboards out
there. Nobody’s put nothing up out
there since... 1986. That was
‘Huggies’.
MILDRED
How much to rent out all three of ‘em
the year?

EXT. COP CAR DRIVING BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT

3

OFFICER DIXON, 35, drives up the billboard road and
approaches, FROM BEHIND, the THIRD billboard. Two LATINO
WORKMEN work on it, buckets and squeegees. As he passes he
looks up at the posters on it, double-takes, SCREECHES to a
halt.
The billboard reads, in large, stark letters “HOW COME, CHIEF
WILLOUGHBY?”.
DIXON
Hey! What the Hell’s this?!
Que?

LATINO

DIXON
“How come Chief Willoughby?” what?
What?
Yeah!
Huh?

LATINO
DIXON
LATINO

DIXON
How come what?
What?!

LATINO

DIXON
Listen, I better start getting some
straight answers outta you Mexican sons
of bitches...
The 2ND LATINO has pointed to the distant SECOND billboard,
making an odd little gesture, and DIXON looks over...

4.
DIXON’S POV: The back of the second billboard, and the BLACK
GUY finishing up with the posters there. END POV.
DIXON sighs, drives off towards it.
4

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD, SECOND BILLBOARD - CONTINUOUS

4

DIXON swings his car around to the front of the billboard. It
reads “AND STILL NO ARRESTS?” The black guy, JEROME, is
emptying out his buckets.
DIXON
(to himself)
What the Hell is this?
(to JEROME)
Hey you? What the fuck is this?
JEROME
What the fuck is what?
This! This!

DIXON

JEROME turns around and reads, as if for the first time.
JEROME
Advertising, I guess.
DIXON
Advertising what?
JEROME reads it again.
JEROME
Something obscure?
I’ll say!

DIXON

JEROME
Don’t I know your face from some place?
DIXON
I dunno, do ya?
JEROME
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
JEROME spits on the ground, looks at him with disdain. DIXON
stares back; a vicious edge between them.
DIXON
I could arrest you right now, if I
wanted to.
For what?

JEROME

5.
DIXON
For... emptying out your bucket there.
It’s against the... being bad against
the environment laws.
JEROME
Well, before you do that, Officer
Dixon, why don’t you go have yourself a
look at that first billboard over
there, and then we can have ourself a
talk about the motherfucking
environment. How about that?
DIXON looks at the distant FIRST BILLBOARD, standing all
alone, back to us, the dark sky behind it. DIXON sighs,
starts his car, pulls away.
We go with him, staying on his face, as he comes to the FIRST
BILLBOARD and slowly stops in front of it. His face falls.
Fuck me.

DIXON

He takes out his cellphone, and presses “WILLOUGHBY (HOME)”.

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

5

CHIEF OF POLICE BILL WILLOUGHBY, 50, having dinner with his
young wife, ANNE, mid-30’s, and his two daughters, POLLY, 5,
and JANE, 7. The telephone rings.
Don’t...

ANNE

WILLOUGHBY, sheepish, answers it.
WILLOUGHBY
Dixon, you goddam asshole, I’m in the
middle of my goddam Easter dinner...

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD, THIRD BILLBOARD - CONTINUOUS
DIXON is out of the car now, pacing.
DIXON
I know, Chief, and I’m sorry for
calling ya at home and all, but uh, I
think we’ve got kind of a problem...
As DIXON passes out of frame, the FIRST BILLBOARD is
revealed. It reads “RAPED WHILE DYING”.
WIDE SHOT of the three billboards stretching away to the
distance.

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

MILDRED drives ROBBIE, her 17-year-old son, past the
billboards - checking his reaction. He sees them but gives
nothing away.
7B

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

7B

She drops him at school. He heads off without a goodbye.
7C

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

7C

She drives up MAIN STREET. Sees activity outside the police
station; WILLOUGHY with his DESK SERGEANT, forcibly telling
DIXON to stay behind, then crossing street to RED’s place.
7D

EXT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

7D

She continues to the other end of town, a GIFT SHOP she works
at. MILDRED’s co-worker, DENISE, black, 28, smokes outside.
MILDRED
Sorry I’m late, Denise.
DENISE
Did you put up those billboards to fuck
with the cops yet?
They’re up.

MILDRED

DENISE
You go, girl! You go fuck those cops
up!
She pats MILDRED on the back, tosses her cigarette away, and
they go inside.
8

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - DAY
Quick-fire dialogue, RED at desk, DESK SERGEANT and
WILLOUGHBY standing.
DESK SERGEANT
What the fuck do you think you’re
doing, Welby, buncha billboards like
that, you didn’t think there’d be some
kinda ramifications? Legally?
RED
What’s the legal ramifications, Cedric?

8

7.
DESK SERGEANT
You want me to explain the legal
ramifications, a little punk like you?
And don’t call me Cedric.
RED
Ain’t contravening no laws on
propriety, ain’t contravening no laws
on any fucking thing. I checked all
this up.
DESK SERGEANT
Oh yeah, where’d you check all this up?
RED
In a... book.
DESK SERGEANT
Which book, genius?
RED
Book called ‘Suck my ass, it’s none o’
your business’.
WILLOUGHBY gives him a long cold stare.
WILLOUGHBY
How long has this person, or persons,
rented these billboards out for?
RED
Oh, the year.
WILLOUGHBY
And how long she actually paid for?
The year.

RED

WILLOUGHBY
So it’s a she, huh?
RED
(pause)
Ain’t at liberty to divulge that kinda
information, Chief.
WILLOUGHBY
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?
RED
Ain’t at liberty to divulge that kinda
information, Chief.
WILLOUGHBY
Do you really wanna fuck with the
Ebbing Police Department, Red? Do ya?

8.

I guess.

RED

INT. POLICE STATION, WILLOUGHBY’S OFFICE - DAY
WILLOUGHBY, DESK SERGEANT and DIXON.
DIXON
He said what?! To your face?!
DESK SERGEANT
No crime has been committed here.
DIXON
Defamation of character ain’t a crime?
DESK SERGEANT
It isn’t defamation if she’s simply
asking a question.
DIXON
What are you, an idiot?
DESK SERGEANT
Don’t call me an idiot, Dixon.
DIXON
I didn’t call you an idiot. I asked if
you was an idiot. It was a question.
WILLOUGHBY
(smiling)
He got ya, Cedric!
DIXON
Well I’m gonna do something about it if
yous two ain’t.
WILLOUGHBY
Where you going? Don’t fly off the
handle!
But Dixon has already stormed out.
DESK SERGEANT
Why in hell you keep that man on, Bill?
WILLOUGHBY
He’s a good man. At heart.
DESK SERGEANT
He tortured a guy in custody, Bill.
WILLOUGHBY
There was no... real evidence to
support that.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

10

As WELBY is coming out of his building, DIXON crosses the
road towards him.
DIXON
Take ‘em down.
Hah?

RED

DIXON
Take ‘em down.
RED
Take what down?
DIXON
You think I wouldn’t take you out,
right here on Main Street, Red?
RED
Thought you only take out black dudes,
Dixon...
DIXON goes to punch him, but WILLOUGHBY is suddenly there,
grabs his punching arm and shoves him towards the station.
People on the street are staring, especially the blacks.
DIXON
(to WELBY)
Ain’t nobody never goes down that road,
anyways. Unless they got lost, or
they’re retards.
13

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

13

MILDRED interviewed by GABRIELLA, CAMERAMAN filming, all
three billboards in the background.
GABRIELLA
This your first time on tv?
Uh-huh.

MILDRED

GABRIELLA
Well, don’t be nervous, is the main
thing, and it’ll be fine. Just don’t
look into the camera, obviously.
MILDRED just stares at her.
GABRIELLA (CONT’D)
In three, two, one. So, Mildred Hayes,
why did you put up these billboards?

10.
MILDRED
Well, my daughter, Angela, she got
abducted, and she got raped and murdered
seven months ago, on this self-same
stretch o’ road here, unfortunately,
and, to me... I mean, to me, it seems
like the local police department is too
busy goin’ round torturing black folks
to be bothered doing anything about
solving actual crime, so I kinda thought
these here billboards might, y’know,
concentrate their minds some.
14

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

14

DIXON sits beside his MOMMA on the couch and is just to bite
into a sandwich...
DIXON
Whatcha watching, Momma? The stupid
news?
...when he’s stopped by MILDRED’s appearance on TV...
MILDRED (TV)
Seems like the local police department
is too busy goin’ round torturing black
folks to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime...
DIXON’S MOMMA looks at him.

Fuck.
15

DIXON
(mouthing)

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - NIGHT
WILLOUGHBY and ANNE watching the end of the interview.
MILDRED (TV)
I don’t know what these policemen are
doing, to be honest with you. I just
know my daughter’s burnt body’s lying
six feet under the ground while they’re
eating Krispy Kremes and busting eight
year-olds for skateboarding in parking
lots.
GABRIELLA (TV)
And what has Chief Willoughby to do
with all this, why single him out?

15

11.
MILDRED (TV)
Well, he’s the head of ‘em, ain’t he?
The buck’s gotta stop at somebody,
don’t it?
GABRIELLA (TV)
And the buck stops at Willoughby?
MILDRED (TV)
Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.
Dead right it does.
He clicks it off, gets up, goes out of the house without a
word.
16

EXT. WILLOUGHBY’S STABLE - NIGHT

16

WILLOUGHBY moodily tending the horses in the stable just
outside the house. ANNE comes up.
ANNE
You alright there, fella?
WILLOUGHBY
Looks like we got a war on our hands.
17

EXT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAWN

17

WILLOUGHBY pulls up outside MILDRED’s poor, clapboard house.
From here we can see that the BILLBOARDS puncturing the dusty
horizon are only A MILE AWAY. MILDRED sees WILLOUGHBY from
the kitchen window, as he knocks. She opens the door.
Can we talk?
18

WILLOUGHBY

EXT. MILDRED’S GARDEN - DAY

18

MILDRED sitting on a creaky swing-set, WILLOUGHBY with hat in
hand.
WILLOUGHBY
I’d do anything to catch the guy who
did it, Mrs Hayes. But when the DNA
don’t match no-one who’s ever been
arrested, and when the DNA don’t match
any other crime nationwide, and when
there wasn’t a single eyewitness from
the time she left your house to the
time we found her, well, right now
there ain’t too much more that we can
do, except...

12.
MILDRED
Could pull blood from every man and boy
in this town, over the age of eight.
WILLOUGHBY
There’s civil rights laws prevents
that, Mrs Hayes, and what if he was
just passing thru town...
MILDRED
Pull blood from ever’ man in the
country, then.
WILLOUGHBY
And what if he was just passing thru
the country?
MILDRED
If it was me, I’d start up a database,
every male baby what’s born, stick ‘em
on it, cross-reference it, and as soon
as they done something wrong, make a
hundred percent certain it was a
correct match, then kill ‘em.
WILLOUGHBY
Yeah, well, there’s definitely civil
rights laws prevents that.
He sits on the swing beside her, the billboards stretching
out down the hill in front of them.
WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
I’m doing everything I can to track him
down, Mrs Hayes. I don’t think those
billboards is very fair.
MILDRED
The time it’s took you to come out here
whining like a bitch, Willoughby, some
other poor girl’s probably being
butchered right now, but it’s good
you’ve got your priorities straight,
I’ll say that for ya.
WILLOUGHBY
There’s something else, Mildred.
(pause)
I got cancer. I’m dying.
I know it.
Huh?

MILDRED
WILLOUGHBY

13.
MILDRED
I know it. Most everbody in town knows
it.
WILLOUGHBY
You know it, and you still put those
billboards up?
MILDRED
Well, they wouldn’t be as effective
after you croak, right?
WILLOUGHBY looks at her in disbelief, gets in his car, drives
off.
22

INT. BAR - NIGHT

22

Town’s main bar, WELBY shooting pool against JAMES, a local
dwarf, who uses a box to stand on. JAMES smacks a good one in
from a distance. DIXON comes up, drunk.
DIXON
Well looky looky, if it ain’t the
instigator of this whole goddam affair
in the first place...
RED
I didn’t instigate shit, Dixon...
DIXON
Playing pool against the town midget.
JAMES pots another.
JAMES
He’s right, Red, you are playing pool
against the town midget.
RED
Well he’s a cop, y’know, he’s
observant.
DIXON
You know, I always disliked you, Red,
ever since you was a snotty little
child, which you still look like. A
snotty little child.
RED
Well that’s unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.
JAMES plays a safety shot. WELBY takes over.
DIXON
Even your name, ‘Red Welby’. Even your
name I disliked.

*

14.
RED
Well... okay.
DIXON
Like you was some kind of a goddam
Communist or something, and proud of it.
RED
No, it’s cos I got red hair.
WELBY misses.
DIXON
Do you know what they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Welby?
RED
Wow, that’s left-field... No, what do
they do to faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?
DIXON
They kill ‘em! Which, it might surprise
you to learn, I am against.
RED
I’m not sure if they do kill faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon. I know Cuba’s
human rights record is pretty
deplorable when it comes to
homosexuality, but killing ‘em? Are you
sure you ain’t thinking of Wyoming?
DIXON
Always with the smart-ass...
JAMES smashes in another.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Jesus! He’s quite good, isn’t he?
(pause)
Willoughby’s a good man, Red. He
shouldn’t have this be the only thing
he thinks about, the last months left
to him.
RED
The last months what?
DIXON
Oh. You didn’t know. Yeah. Pancreatic.
RED is shaken. Out of nowhere, MILDRED idles over, puts a
bunch of quarters on the pool table.
MILDRED
I’m up next if any of you ole ladies
ever quit yakking.

15.
She hangs there, staring them down.
Rude.

DIXON

JAMES
Saw you on TV the other day, Mildred.
Oh yeah?

MILDRED

JAMES
Yeah, you looked good.
She stares at him. An embarrassed pause.
JAMES (CONT’D)
I mean, y’know, you came across really
good, in the things you were saying.
Embarrassed, JAMES goes back to the pool.
DIXON
I didn’t think you came across really
good in the things you were saying. I
thought you came across stupid-ass.
MILDRED
Ain’t it about time you got home to
your momma, Dixon?
DIXON
No it ain’t time I got home to my
momma. I tole her I was gonna be out
til twelve. Actually.
JAMES whacks in the black brilliantly from a distance...
Jesus!

DIXON (CONT’D)

JAMES
Me v. you, Mildred!
He smiles at her.
24

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

24

MILDRED enters, a beer in hand, a bit drunk...
MILDRED
Hey Robbie? I think that midget wants
to get in my pants...
...to find FATHER MONTGOMERY, an old priest she knows, at the
kitchen table beside ROBBIE, best teacups in front of them.

*

16.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
Father Montgomery.
FATHER MONTGOMERY
Mildred. I’m sorry for calling on you
so late, although I must say Robbie’s
been the consummate host. Despite his
having, he was just telling me,
something of a tricky day at school.
ROBBIE
Oh, no, just some of the guys on the
team was giving me crap.
MILDRED
Crap about what?
FATHER MONTGOMERY
About the billboards. Which is, uh,
kind of what I’ve come to have a word
with you about, Mildred.
Oh. Proceed.

MILDRED

FATHER MONTGOMERY
I know it’s been hard for you, Mildred,
this past year. We all do. The whole
town does. And whatever it is you need,
we’ll be there for you. Always. But the
town also knows what kind of a man
William Willoughby is. And the town is
dead set against these billboards of
yours.
MILDRED
Took a poll, did ya, Father?
FATHER MONTGOMERY
If you hadn’t stopped coming to church,
Mildred, you’d be aware of the depth of
people’s feelings. I had a dozen people
come up to me on Sunday. So, yes, I
took a poll. Everybody is on your side
about Angela. No-one’s on your side
about this.
MILDRED
Y’know what I was thinking about,
earlier today? I was thinking ‘bout
those streetgangs they got in Los
Angeles, the Crips and the Bloods? I
was thinking about that buncha new laws
they came up with, in the 80’s I think
it was, to combat those street-gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.
(MORE)

17.
MILDRED (CONT'D)
And, if I remember rightly, the gist of
what those new laws said was, if you
join one of these gangs, and you’re
running with ‘em, and down the block
from you one night, unbeknownst to you,
your fellow Crips, or your fellow
Bloods, shoot up a place, or stab a
guy, well, even though you didn’t know
nothing about it, even though you
may’ve just been standing on a
streetcorner minding your own business,
those new laws said you are still
culpable. You are still culpable, by
the very act of joining those Crips, or
those Bloods, in the first place. Which
got me thinking, Father, that whole
type of situation is kinda similar to
you Church boys, ain’t it? You’ve got
your colors, you’ve got your clubhouse,
you’re, for want of a better word, a
gang. And if you’re upstairs smoking a
pipe and reading a bible while one of
your fellow gang members is downstairs
fucking an altar boy then, Father, just
like the Crips, and just like the
Bloods, you’re culpable. Cos you joined
the gang, man. And I don’t care if you
never did shit or never saw shit or
never heard shit. You joined the gang.
You’re culpable. And when a person is
culpable to altar-boy-fucking, or anykinda-boy-fucking, I know you guys
didn’t really narrow it down, then they
kinda forfeit the right to come into my
house and say a word about me, or my
life, or my daughter, or my billboards.
So, why don’t you just finish your tea
there, Father, and get the fuck outta
my kitchen.
She goes off to another room. MONTGOMERY puts down his
teacup.
ROBBIE
But thanks for coming up anyway,
Father.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

25

DOCTOR drawing WILLOUGHBY’s blood as he looks away from it,
squeamish, out the window at the pretty landscape.
DOCTOR
How you been feeling, Bill?
WILLOUGHBY
Oh, like I got cancer in a major organ.

*

18.
DOCTOR
Well I just want you to know, we’re all
on your side about this Mildred Hayes
thing...
WILLOUGHBY
If I have to hear that one more fucking
time...!
WILLOUGHBY wrenches the needle from his arm, and tosses the
vial at a wall, where it smashes and splatters.
WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
I’m done with this shit. I can’t waste
my life waiting.
26

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - DAY

26

WILLOUGHBY breezes in, doing up his tie. DIXON’s hungover.
WILLOUGHBY
Get me the file on the Hayes case.
DIXON
The Angela Hayes case or the Mildred
Hayes case?
WILLOUGHBY
There is no Mildred Hayes case.
DIXON
We’ve had two official complaints about
the billboards, so, actually...
From who?

WILLOUGHBY

DIXON
(flipping thru pad)
A lady with a funny eye... and a fat dentist.
WILLOUGHBY
Get me the file on the Angela Hayes
case. “A lady with a funny fucking
eye”, Jesus Christ.
27

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

27

Backs of the billboards framed behind him, WILLOUGHBY has the
case file laid out on the hood of his car, weighted with
rocks. Some gruesome photos of a burned corpse that we don’t
see much of but DIXON does, wincing, nauseous.
Late night?

WILLOUGHBY

19.

No.

DIXON

WILLOUGHBY
Lay off that Welby guy.
DIXON
Or you’ll do what?
WILLOUGHBY
Or I’ll kick your Momma’s teeth in.
DIXON
No you won’t.
(pause)
Who told ya I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?
WILLOUGHBY
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Fucking midgets! I’m trying to fucking
concentrate!
DIXON shrugs. WILLOUGHBY, goes back to the file. DIXON
ambles, bored. WILLOUGHBY crouches, runs his fingers thru the
burnt soil there, looking like he might cry.
DIXON
What are you looking for, anyway?
There’s nothing to look for.

INT. DENTIST’S SURGERY - DAY
MILDRED in a dentist’s chair.
MILDRED
I don’t know what it is. The filling
feels like it’s kinda waggling.
GEOFFREY, a fat dentist, appears, with his instruments.
GEOFFREY
Well if it’s waggling it’s gonna haveta
come out.
MILDRED
(bemused)
Ain’t you gonna have a look at it
first?
GEOFFREY does so, perfunctorily.
GEOFFREY
It’s gonna haveta come out.
Bemused, she guesses he knows what he’s doing. He fiddles
among his drills, comes up with a high pitched one.

30

20.
MILDRED
Uh, can I get a little Novocaine,
there, Doc?
He puts the drill down, gets a syringe, injects in under her
gum at painful angles and length, takes it out and looks at
his watch, just sitting there.
GEOFFREY
Give it a couple minutes.
MILDRED
(pause)
Maybe it wasn’t waggling. Maybe it was
just my fingers going in and out.
Silence. He picks up the drill again, gets it going.
GEOFFREY
I just wanted to say... There’s a lotta
good friends of Bill Willoughby in this
town, Mrs Hayes, who don’t take kindly
to...
But MILDRED has already grabbed the drill hand, then grabbed
the hand that was holding her mouth open. She slowly starts
bringing one hand towards the other, the whirring drill
aiming towards his big fat thumbnail.
GEOFFREY is too flabby, and MILDRED too forceful, for him to
do anything about it but whimper, as...
CLOSE UP: The drill gets closer and closer to his thumbnail.
GEOFFREY sweating...
MILDRED determined...
...until finally the drill WHIRS INTO THE NAIL, splitting it
right down the center, then continuing DEEPER, whirring into
the bloody flesh under the nail until the nail spins off
altogether.
MILDRED
Then why don’t you tell those good
friends of Bill Willoughby to tell Bill
Willoughby to go do his fucking job,
fat boy.
She pushes the screaming bloody dentist out of the way,
rinses her mouth out with the pink stuff, spits it at his
head, and exits.
31

INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

31

DENISE behind counter, MILDRED arranging knickknacks. Cop car
pulls up, lights flashing. WILLOUGHBY and DIXON enter.

21.
WILLOUGHBY
Hey there, Mildred! You didn’t happen
to pay a visit to the dentist today,
did ya?
MILDRED’s dialogue hereon is thru a totally unintelligible,
Novocained mouth.

No.
Huh?

MILDRED
(unintelligibly)
WILLOUGHBY

MILDRED
(unintelligibly)
Said ‘No’.
WILLOUGHBY
Oh. So it wasn’t you who drilled a
little hole in one of big fat
Geoffrey’s big fat thumbnails, no?
MILDRED
(unintelligibly)
Of course not.
Huh?

WILLOUGHBY

MILDRED
(unintelligibly)
I said “Of course not.”
DENISE
You drilled a hole in the dentist?
MILDRED
(unintelligibly)
No, Denise, I didn’t.
Huh?

DENISE

WILLOUGHBY
Well, I thought it was kinda funny
myself, but he wants to press charges,
so we’re gonna have to bring you in,
I’m afraid.
32

INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
DIXON guarding door. MILDRED looking out window.

32

22.
MILDRED’S POV: Across the road, WELBY and PAMELA are looking
out at the pedestrians in the sunshine. WELBY’s obviously
into her, but shy about it. END POV.
MILDRED smiles. The novocaine’s worn off.
MILDRED
So how’s it all going in the niggertorturing business, Dixon?
DIXON
It’s ‘Persons of color’-torturing
business, these days, if you want to
know. And I didn’t torture nobody.
She idles back to the table and sits.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Goddam saying that goddam stuff on TV.
My momma watches that station!
MILDRED
And she didn’t know nothing about the
torturing?
DIXON
No she didn’t know anything about it.
She’s against that kinda thing.
WILLOUGHBY breezes in.
WILLOUGHBY
Who’s against what kinda thing?
DIXON
My momma. Is against ‘Persons-of-color
torturing’. She said ‘nigger-torturing’.
I said you can’t say ‘nigger-torturing’
no more. You gotta say ‘Persons-of-color’
torturing. Right?
WILLOUGHBY
I think I’ll be able to take care of
Mrs Hayes on my own from hereon, Jason.
DIXON
Sure, Chief, I’ll be right outside if
you need me.
DIXON gives WILLOUGHBY a pat on the back as he leaves.
WILLOUGHBY sits with some papers.

23.
WILLOUGHBY
Don’t gimme that look. If you got rid
of every cop with vaguely racist
leanings then you’d have three cops
left and all o’ them are gonna hate the
fags so what are ya gonna do, y’know?
He smiles at MILDRED, then comes round and sits on her side
of the desk, looking down on her.
WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
I wanna know something, Mildred...
MILDRED
Does sitting up high like that make you
feel more powerful, Chief?
WILLOUGHBY
I’m sorry, Mildred, I’ll go sit where I was
if it makes you feel more comfortable.
MILDRED
I didn’t say I was uncomfortable. I
don’t get uncomfortable around cops.
Sit wherever you want. It’s your police
station.
WILLOUGHBY
Why’d ya drill a hole thru poor fat
Geoffrey’s thumbnail?
MILDRED
Oh, that didn’t happen. His hand
slipped and he drilled a hole thru his
self. Is he saying I done it? Jeez,
then I guess it’s just his word against
mine, huh? Kinda like in all those rape
cases you hear about. Except, in this
instance, the chick ain’t losing.
WILLOUGHBY
It ain’t really about winning or
losing, though, is it, Mildred? I mean,
do you think I care about who wins or
loses between the two of yous? Do you
think I care about dentists? I don’t
care about dentists. Nobody cares about
dentists! I do care about, or I’m
interested in, tying you up in court so
long that your hours at the gift shop
are so shot to shit that you ain’t got
a penny to pay for another months
billboards. I’m interested in that.
MILDRED
I got some dough put away...

24.
WILLOUGHBY
What I heard was you had to sell off
your ex-husband’s tractor-trailer to
even pay for this month’s billboards,
that right?
(pause)
How is ole Charlie, by the way? He
still shacked up with that pretty
little intern works down at the zoo?
MILDRED
He’s still shacked up with some chick
who smells of shit. I don’t know if the
zoo’s got anything to do with it.
Although I’d hope so.
WILLOUGHBY
How old is she? Nineteen? That must
smart.
MILDRED
Keep trying, Officer. Keep trying.
WILLOUGHBY
What’s Charlie think about these here
billboards of yours, an ex-cop like
Charlie?
MILDRED
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater. Same
difference, I guess, right?
WILLOUGHBY
His word against yours, though, right?
(pause)
Charlie don’t know about them, does he?
MILDRED
It’s none of his business.
WILLOUGHBY
He’s kinda paying for ‘em though, ain’t
he?
MILDRED
I’m paying for ‘em.
WILLOUGHBY
This month you are. How about when...
WILLOUGHBY suddenly let’s out a short sharp cough which
spurts a spray of blood that hits MILDRED in the face, wholly
by accident. Horrified, shaking, WILLOUGHBY tries to wipe her
face with a handkerchief, MILDRED almost in tears at his
embarrassment.
WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean to...

25.

I know...

MILDRED

WILLOUGHBY
It was an accident...
MILDRED
I know, baby.
It’s blood.
I know.

WILLOUGHBY
MILDRED

They’re both in tears, and there’s a desperation in his eyes,
as he sits there shaking.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
I’ll go get somebody...
She rushes out the door.
33

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

33

WILLOUGHBY is gurneyed into an ambulance past TOWNS-PEOPLE,
DIXON beside him.
WILLOUGHBY
Just let her go.
DIXON rolls his eyes.
WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
Just let her go!
34

DIXON nods as the ambulance doors close.

34

35

EXT. LOWER MAIN STREET - DAY

35

MILDRED, still stunned, wipes the remaining spots of blood
from her face, as TOWNS-PEOPLE (including the bandaged
GEOFFREY and a LADY WITH A FUNNY EYE) come up to her angrily
and, oddly, JEROME drives a remote-controlled jeep along the
sidewalk towards them.
LADY WITH A FUNNY EYE
Take those goddam things down!
GEOFFREY
Take ‘em down.
Or we will!

LADY WITH A FUNNY EYE

26.
MILDRED
Any of you funny-eyed fuckers even
think about touching those billboards,
you will fucking die. You got that? You
will fucking die.
JEROME drives his toy car into GEOFFREY’s ankle.
JEROME
Yeah, leave her alone. Those billboards
are cool!
JEROME picks up his jeep and heads off, and MILDRED is left
to walk away alone, the TOWNSPEOPLE watching, GEOFFREY
rubbing his ankle.
From his second storey window, RED WELBY has been watching
the distant scene. He looks across at the police station, and
sees that DIXON has been watching HIM from his ground floor
window. DIXON slowly closes his blinds.
36

INT. CAR - DUSK

36

MILDRED driving ROBBIE home from school.
ROBBIE
Do birds get cancer?
Huh?

MILDRED

ROBBIE
Birds. Do they get cancer?
MILDRED
I don’t know. Dogs do.
ROBBIE
Yeah, well, I wasn’t talking about
dogs, was I?
The car turns onto the billboard road.
ROBBIE (CONT’D)
Great, the good ole “Raped While Dying”
route home.
(MORE)

27.
ROBBIE (CONT’D)
Cos if there was two seconds in a day
when I didn’t think about her, and
wasn’t thinking about how she died,
“There ya go, Robbie, think about it
some more, why don’t ya?” It’s good,
too, that as much as a person might’ve
tried to avoid the details of what
happened, cos he didn’t think it’d do
any good, and he didn’t think he could
bear it, it’s also good to be informed
in twenty foot high lettering, and a
real nice font, the precise details of
her last moments, y’know? That it
wasn’t enough that she was raped, and
it wasn’t enough that she died, no.
“Raped While Dying”. Thank you, mom.
MILDRED
I gave you the police reports...
ROBBIE
I didn’t read ‘em! I’m depressed enough
as it fucking is!
37

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

37

ROBBIE slams into his room, leaving MILDRED alone and quiet.
She goes into ANGELA’s room, sits on the bed a while.
Mom?
Yeah?

ANGELA (O.S.)
MILDRED (O.S.)

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
FLASHBACK. It’s ten months ago. MILDRED washing dishes.
ROBBIE drawing, ANGELA dressed to go out.
ANGELA
You ain’t going out again tonight, are
ya?
MILDRED
Denise said we might get us a coupla
drinks later, yeah.
ANGELA
Denise gonna be driving ya?
MILDRED
Angela, why don’t you just ask me if
you can borrow the car?

28.
ANGELA
Can I borrow the car?
No.
Bitch!

MILDRED
ANGELA

MILDRED
But I’ll give you money for a taxi if
you ask me nice and don’t call me a
bitch.
ANGELA
Why did you make me ask you borrow it
if you was never gonna let me borrow
it?
MILDRED
Cos it was funny. And cos you’ve been
smoking pot all day.
ANGELA
You are such a hypocrite!
MILDRED
‘Hypocrite,’ how?
ANGELA
You drove drunk with us in the car when
we was kids.
MILDRED
What are you talking about?
ANGELA
Daddy told me.
MILDRED
(pause)
When did you see him?
ANGELA
I see him all the time, don’t change
the subject. Did you or did you not
drive drunk with us in the car when we
was kids?
MILDRED
Once, maybe...
ANGELA
Oh, ‘once,’ okay...
MILDRED
...when he was in the middle of beating
the shit out of me...

29.
ANGELA
Which we’ve only got your word about,
right?
ROBBIE
For Christ’s sake, Angela...
ANGELA
Oh why are you never on my side,
Robbie?
ROBBIE
I’m always on your side when you’re not
being a cunt.
Hey!

ANGELA

MILDRED
(same time)
Hey..! There’ll be no more ‘Cunts’ in
this house, you got that, Mister?
ROBBIE
What, are you moving out?
Both women glare at him.
ROBBIE (CONT’D)
It was a gag!
ANGELA
So are ya gonna let me borrow the car
or what?
MILDRED
Why don’t you just walk, Angela? Why
don’t you just walk?
ANGELA
You know what, I will walk, I will
walk. And y’know what? I hope I get
raped on the way.
ANGELA storms out...
MILDRED
Yeah? Well I hope you get raped on the
way too!
Door slams. FLASHBACK over.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
WILLOUGHBY in a bed, ANNE nearby, DOCTOR checking him.

38

30.
DOCTOR
We’re gonna need to keep you in a few
days, Bill. You shouldn’t be coughing
up blood.
WILLOUGHBY
Yeah, I kinda guessed that, Doc.
DOCTOR
I’ll swing by in the morning. Anne.
DOCTOR departs, and we listen to his echoing footsteps as
they look at each other.
ANNE
Guess I’ll go get your coat, huh?
WILLOUGHBY
Well you know I ain’t staying...
ANNE
And you know I ain’t arguing.
She smiles and goes out, footsteps echo away, leaving him
alone there, in the sterile quiet. Scared.

EXT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAWN

A pretty pink sunrise over the hills behind the house.
40B

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

40B

MILDRED and ROBBIE getting their breakfasts in silence,
ROBBIE more moody than she is. She tries to make him laugh,
he ignores her. Finally, she takes a big spoonful of milk and
cereal, and she slings it straight in his face and hair.
MILDRED
Slipped. Oops.
She stares at him, deadpan, as milk and cereal drip down his
face and hair.
ROBBIE
You... old... cunt.
MILDRED
(suppressing laughter)
I ain’t old, Robbie..
ROBBIE can’t help but smile, then hears the sound of a car
pulling up on the gravel outside.
That’s dad.

ROBBIE

31.
He wipes his face, rushes to the door, MILDRED apprehensive.
41

EXT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

41

Her ex, CHARLIE, slams his car door shut and approaches the
front door as ROBBIE opens it. CHARLIE’s nineteen year old
girlfriend, PENELOPE, remains in the passenger seat.
ROBBIE
Hey dad! How you doing?
CHARLIE
Where’s the crazy lady...?
ROBBIE gestures inside and CHARLIE breezes in. ROBBIE waves
to PENELOPE, who smiles and gives an embarrassed wave back.
42

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

42

ROBBIE, CHARLIE and MILDRED, who’s still finishing breakfast.
CHARLIE
The kid’s got Rice fucking Krispies in
his fucking hair! What’s going on
around here? And what the fuck’s going
on with these fucking billboards,
Mildred?
MILDRED
Kinda self-explanatory, ain’t it?
CHARLIE
Well why don’t you just explain it to
me?
MILDRED
Guess it ain’t self-explanatory then.
Well, y’know, I guess I wanted certain
people’s minds kept on certain people’s
jobs, is all. I hadn’t heard a word
from ‘em in seven goddam months, but I
tell ya this, I heard an awful lot from
‘em since I put those billboards up...
CHARLIE
You think this has focussed their
minds? I’ll tell you what it’s focussed
their minds on. It’s focussed their
minds on how exactly are they gonna
fuck you up.
MILDRED
The more you keep a case in the public
eye, the better your chances of getting
it solved, it’s in all the guidebooks,
Charlie.

32.
CHARLIE
How much those billboards cost?
MILDRED
‘Bout the same as a tractor-trailer.
ROBBIE sniggers.
CHARLIE
What the fuck are you laughing at?
Nothing.

ROBBIE

CHARLIE
Laughed at by a guy with fucking cereal
in his hair!
ROBBIE
How’s Penelope?
CHARLIE
Huh? She’s alright.
ROBBIE
Why don’t you invite her in, save
leaving her sitting there?
She’s here?

MILDRED

CHARLIE
She’s out in the car.
MILDRED
Oh. That explains it.
CHARLIE
That explains what?
MILDRED
I knew I could smell something.
CHARLIE overturns the table violently and, as MILDRED backs
away, grabs her by the neck and pins her against the wall.
Just as suddenly, a knife is placed against CHARLIE’s throat
by ROBBIE, deadly serious.
Let her go.

ROBBIE

Just then, the sound of a screen door creaking is heard, and
PENELOPE is standing there, startled by the scene.

33.
PENELOPE
Oh, um, I kinda needed to use the
bathroom, but if it’s inconvenient,
actually it is inconvenient, isn’t it,
I can see it’s inconvenient, I can hold
it, it’s alright...
CHARLIE lets go of MILDRED and ROBBIE lowers the knife.
ROBBIE
It’s the first door, down the hall.
PENELOPE
Are you sure? I feel like I’m
intruding...
Just go pee!

CHARLIE

PENELOPE quickly heads down the hall to the toilet, leaving
the three of them staring at each other. ROBBIE sets right
the upturned table.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Since when did you grow a pair of
balls?
ROBBIE
‘Bout seven months ago.
MILDRED
Look, you’ve said what you came to say.
Okay? Why don’t ya just go get zoo girl
and get the hell out of my house?
Alright?
PENELOPE comes out of toilet, goes to the screen door, turns.
PENELOPE
Um, actually, zoo-wise, they were
letting people go at the zoo,
unfortunately, and it was a case of
“Last in, first out”, so, yeah,
unfortunately the zoo had to let me go.
But they were looking for people down
at the horse-rides for the disableds,
to look after the horses down there, so
I’m working down there now, looking
after the disableds horses, so...
(pause)
The horses aren’t disableds. The
disableds are.
(pause)
I like all animals.
She pauses again, then exits.

34.
CHARLIE
Don’t say a word.
MILDRED
I wasn’t gonna say a word.
CHARLIE
Don’t you think I don’t wish it had
never happened?! Don’t you think I
don’t wish she was here still?!
MILDRED
I know you do. I know you do.
CHARLIE
Billboards ain’t gonna bring her back,
Mildred.
MILDRED
Neither is fucking nineteen year olds,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
Yeah. But I know that.
MILDRED
(pause)
Just go.
CHARLIE
Yeah, alright, I’m such a shitty dad
and you’re such a great mom. Alright.
So how come a week before she died she
comes around asking if she can move in
with me at my place, cos she couldn’t
stand the two of yous bitching at each
other no more, and fighting with each
other no more...
MILDRED
I don’t believe you...
CHARLIE
And I said “No, stay at home, your mom
loves you.” And now I wish I hadn’t,
cos if I hadn’t she’d still fucking be
here!
MILDRED
I don’t believe you!
CHARLIE
Don’t believe me. Ask Fruit Loop boy.
CHARLIE leaves. Sound of his car pulling away.
Is it true?

MILDRED

35.
ROBBIE
I don’t know, mom.
MILDRED
Yeah, you do.
39

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - DAY

39

DIXON beside his MOMMA on couch. He’s got his tortoise on his
lap, she pours a margarita from a ready-made plastic pack.
They’re watching on TV the start of ‘Don’t Look Now’.
DIXON
Oh not Donald Sutherland again! What is
this, a Donald Sutherland season?!
MOMMA
I like him. I like his hair.
Hair!

DIXON

MOMMA
This is the one where his little girl
dies.
DIXON
Always a plus in a movie!
(pause)
It any good?
MOMMA
It’s got a great sex scene.
DIXON gives her an uncomfortable glance.
MOMMA (CONT’D)
Talking of dead kids, what’s happening
with the Billboard lady?
DIXON
Oh that cooze won’t listen to reason.
She’s as tough as an old boot!
MOMMA
Oh. Why don’t you just fuck her over
thru her friends then?
Huh?

DIXON

MOMMA
Y’know, why don’t you fuck her friends
over? Make her come around that way.
Has she got some friends you could fuck
over?

36.
DIXON thinks about it, nods.
43

EXT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

MILDRED finds the shop shut. A handwritten note on it reads
“I GOT ARRESTED! DENISE!” With an unsmiley face.
50

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - DAY
DESK SERGEANT sighs as MILDRED enters. DIXON is some desks
away across the crowded station.
MILDRED
(shouted at DIXON)
Hey fuckhead?!
Every COP turns to look at her, the audacity of it...
What?

DIXON

DESK SERGEANT
Don’t say ‘What’, Dixon, when she comes
in calling you a fuckhead, and don’t
you come in here...
MILDRED
Shut up!
(to DIXON)
You! Get over here.
DIXON
No. You get over here.
Alright...

MILDRED

She heads over to DIXON.
DESK SERGEANT
What?! Don’t... Dixon!
DIXON
What?! I’m taking care of this!
DESK SERGEANT
You do not allow a member of the public
to call you a fuckhead in the station
house!
DIXON
That’s what I’m doing, I’m taking care
of it! In my own way. Actually. Now get
out of my ass!
DESK SERGEANT sighs and goes back to work.

50

37.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Mrs Hayes. What is it I can do for you
today?
MILDRED
Where’s Denise Watson?
DIXON
Denise Watson’s in the Clank.
MILDRED
On what charge?
Possession.
Of what?

DIXON
MILDRED

DIXON
Two marijuana cigarettes. Big ones.
MILDRED
When’s the bail hearing?
DIXON
I asked the Judge not to give her bail
on account of her previous marijuana
violations and the Judge said sure.
MILDRED
You fucking prick.
DIXON
You do not call an officer of the law a
fucking prick in his own station-house,
Mrs Hayes. Or anywhere, actually.
MILDRED
(leaving)
What’s with the new hard-boiled
attitude, Dixon? Your momma been
coaching ya?
DIXON
No. My momma doesn’t do that.
MILDRED passes DESK SERGEANT on the way out.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Take ‘em down, Hayes!
She’s gone.
DESK SERGEANT
You did good, Dixon.

38.
DIXON
Yeah, I know I did.
DESK SERGEANT just sighs.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL MEADOW BESIDE LAKE - DAY

47

ANNE is looking confused, glass of wine in hand. The kids in
the middle of a blanket on the grass, holding a child’s
magnetic fishing rod each. WILLOUGHBY tosses teddy bears and
dolls two meters away from the circumference of the blanket.
WILLOUGHBY
Now, the rules here are twofold; no kid
can leave this goddam blanket at any
goddam time, and every single one of
these dolls and these teddy bears has
gotta be hooked up. Now, your momma and
I, although it won’t look like it,
we’ll be watching every goddam move you
make and the most important thing while
we’re watching you is you do not leave
this blanket. The next most important
thing is you do not at any stage allow
the fishing rods to stick into you or
your sister’s eyeballs, as this would
be counter-productive to the entire
operation. What would this be?
BOTH GIRLS
(stumbling)
Counterproductive to the entire
operation.
WILLOUGHBY
Good. Then troops... start fishing.
They do so, as WILLOUGHBY grabs a blanket, a bottle of wine,
takes ANNE by the hand and leads her uphill to the treeline.
ANNE
We. Are. Not.
We are.

WILLOUGHBY

She looks back at the kids, safe within the confines of the
blanket, and let’s herself be led.
51

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

51

MILDRED fixing flowers in pots at the billboards, making them
look nice. It’s a beautiful, blue-skied day; pretty birds
mooch around, and out of nowhere a fawn suddenly appears.

39.
MILDRED stays dead still, breathless at the beauty of it,
watching as it almost appears to look up at “AND STILL NO
ARRESTS” and cock its head at the question. It spots MILDRED
suddenly and is startled slightly, but stands its ground.
MILDRED
Hey baby. Yep, still no arrests. How
come, I wonder? Cos there ain’t no God
and the world’s empty and it don’t
matter what we do to each other? Ooh, I
hope not.
(pause)
How comes you came up here outta
nowhere, looking so pretty? You ain’t
trying to make me believe in
reincarnation or something, are ya?
Well, you’re pretty, but you ain’t her.
She got killed, and now she’ll be dead
forever. I do thank you for coming up,
though. If I had some food I’d give it
ya, but I’ve only got some Doritos and
I’d be scared they’d kill ya, they’re
kinda pointy. Then where would we be?
The fawn finally decides to amble away, off towards the hazy
sunset horizon. She almost cries but doesn’t quite.
Oh Mildred.
49

MILDRED (CONT’D)

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - DAY

49

MILDRED sitting at desk, WELBY idling shiftily by the window.
RED
Yeah, so I, uh, just happened to be
looking over our contract we drew up
back that time, and what I realised
was, I realised that although payment
is to be made on the first day of each
month, uh, the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit, wasn’t it, like
we said, so actually, in point of fact,
you’re actually behind in your payments
now, by, yeah, a month.
She gives him a look.
RED (CONT’D)
Yeah. That’s, uh, what the contract
says. Looking it over an’ all. The
lawyer says so too.
MILDRED
When do you need this next payment by,
Red?

40.
RED
Uh, well, now, really.
Another look.
RED (CONT’D)
Or Fuh uh... Friday?
MILDRED
Wow. When you can’t trust the lawyers
and the advertising men, what the
hell’s America coming to, huh?
(pause)
Who got to ya? Willoughby?
RED
Nobody got to me.
MILDRED
My fat fucking ass!
RED
He’s dying, Mildred.
MILDRED
We’re all fucking dying!
PAMELA knocks at the door.
Red?

PAMELA

RED
Oh, hi Pamela! Um, we’re a little bit
busy, at the moment, Pam, if that’s
okay...
PAMELA
Oh Red, I know, and I know you were
real anxious about talking to Mrs Hayes
this morning and all...
RED
Anxious? No...
PAMELA
But that’s the thing, there’s no need
to be, cos you won’t believe it! A
little Mexican delivery boy just
dropped in with this...
PAMELA hands WELBY an envelope, full of banknotes.
RED
What the hell’s this?!

41.
PAMELA
I know! It’s five thousand dollars! And
guess what the note says? It says it’s
to pay for the rental on Mrs Hayes’s
billboards! Can you believe it? That’s
why I butted in!
RED
Well, who’s it from?
PAMELA
Well, it doesn’t say.
RED
Well, where’s the delivery boy?
PAMELA
Well, he went.
RED
Well, did you see what company he was
from?
Well, no.

PAMELA

RED
Well, what kinda uniform did he have
on?
PAMELA
Well, he just looked like one of those
fat little Mexican boys.
(pause)
On a bicycle?
(pause)
Did I do something wrong?
RED
No, Pam, you did good.
MILDRED
Yeah, Pam, you did real good.
PAMELA
Did I? Great! Ain’t life crazy?
PAMELA smiles, gives RED the thumbs up, leaves.
MILDRED
What’s the note say?
RED
Says, er, “This here money is to go
towards the fund for Mildred Hayes’s
billboards, cos she ain’t the only one
round here who hates the pigs. Signed,
a friend.”

42.
MILDRED
Jeez, I guess ya can’t be picky who
your friends are these days, huh?
(standing)
Um, be good to get a little receipt off
ya, Red, y’know, saying the price of
next month’s is paid in full an’ all.
RED
Oh. Sure, Mildred, sure.
MILDRED
Yeah. Like, now.
Oh! Sure!

RED

WELBY hurriedly writes one out.

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - NIGHT
WILLOUGHBY tucks the kids in as they giggle.
JANE
Is mommy drunk, daddy?
WILLOUGHBY
No, no, she’s just got a little
migraine, that’s all. A little
Chardonnay migraine, now no more chit
chat out of you two, ok?
JANE
Can we stay home from school again
tomorrow, daddy?
WILLOUGHBY
We’ll see what your mommy says in the
morning, darling...
Aww!

JANE/POLLY

WILLOUGHBY
But I’m pretty sure she’ll say yes
though...
Yay!

JANE/POLLY

WILLOUGHBY
Now eyes closed and get some sleep,
okay?
He kisses them goodnight, switches the light off.

53

INT. WILLOUGHBY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

53

ANNE is lying on the couch, a small wet towel over her eyes.
WILLOUGHBY sits in beside her and kisses her.
WILLOUGHBY
You don’t smell of puke. Which is good.
ANNE
Aquafresh. Trick I learned.
Women, huh?

WILLOUGHBY

ANNE
Oh yeah. Resourceful.
WILLOUGHBY
It’s still your turn to clean the
horseshit outta the stable, y’know?
ANNE
Oh those fucking horses! They’re your
fucking horses! I’m gonna have those
fucking horses shot!
WILLOUGHBY
I’ll do it, you lazy bitch.
ANNE
Thank you, poppa.
(pause)
That was a real nice day. And that was
a real nice fuck. You got a real nice
cock, Mr Willoughby.
WILLOUGHBY
Is that from a play, “You got a real
nice cock, Mr Willoughby?” I think I
heard it in a Shakespeare one time.
ANNE
You dummy. It’s Oscar Wilde.
She puts the towel back over her eyes as he laughs.
54

INT. WILLOUGHBY’S STABLE - NIGHT

54

The horses watch as he finishes shovelling the shit, lays out
fresh hay, gives them a pat, thinks about the day, smiles.
WILLOUGHBY
“Oscar Wilde.”
He smiles again, then picks up a black hood, on the outside
of which he has pinned a note that reads “Don’t open the bag.
Just telephone the boys”.

44.
He places the black hood snugly over his head so the note is
visible, cocks a large handgun, raises the gun to his temple,
and shoots himself through the head. His dead body falls
heavily to the ground, the hood concealing all the mess.
55

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

55

ANNE pulls the towel off her eyes, having heard something.
She gets up and we go with her, camera on her face, as she
moves all the way thru the house to the kitchen, where she
stops suddenly, and her face falls...
ANNE
No. No. No...!
We see what she sees - a plain white envelope propped on the
bare kitchen table, the single word ‘ANNE’ dead center of it.
ANNE (CONT’D)
No! No! No! No!
She breaks down crying on the cold kitchen floor.
WE HEAR WILLOUGHBY’S NOTE OVER THE FOLLOWING SILENT IMAGES;
56A

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - NIGHT

POLLY and JANE framed in their dark doorway, as their mother
cries on the floor;
56E

EXT. WILLOUGHBY’S STABLE - NIGHT

The horses bemused in WILLOUGHBY’s garden, as ANNE stands
drained in the doorway of the stable, the crescent moon above
it. She slowly trudges back to the house;
56G

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - NIGHT

56G

ANNE lying on JANE’s bed, hugging POLLY and JANE to her, all
eyes open, numb, as a UNIFORMED COP stands guard outside the
room and other COPS move thru the house;
56H

EXT. BEAUTIFUL MEADOW BESIDE LAKE - NIGHT

56H

The beautiful lakeside in the moonlight, and the one teddybear laying there that they missed, its grumpy little face;
56I

EXT. WILLOUGHBY’S STABLE - NIGHT

56I

Flashing lights the COPS and AMBULANCE PEOPLE at the stable;

45.
Blood seeping along the “Just telephone the boys” part of the
note (so only the words ‘The Just’ aren’t blood-covered). The
DESK SERGEANT winces as he opens the hood.
56J

INT. WILLOUGHBY HOUSE - NIGHT

56J

WILLOUGHBY quietly finishing the note at the kitchen table,
ANNE’s drunken feet, in fun socks, visible on the distant
couch. He puts it in an envelope marked ‘ANNE’, gets up, and
quietly leaves the house;
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
My darling Anne. There’s a longer
letter in the dresser drawer I’ve been
writing for the last week or so. That
one covers us, and my memories of us,
and how much I’ve always loved you.
This one just covers tonight, and, more
importantly, today. Tonight I have gone
out to the horses to end it. I cannot
say sorry for the act itself, although
I know that for a short time you will
be angry at me or even hate me for it.
Please don’t. This is not a case of “I
came in this world alone, and I’m going
out of it alone” or anything dumb like
that. I did not come in this world
alone, my mom was there, and I am not
going out of it alone, cos you are
there, drunk on the couch, making Oscar
Wilde cock jokes. No. This is a case,
in some senses, of bravery. Not the
bravery of facing a bullet down; the
next few months of pain would be far
harder than that small flash. No, it’s
the bravery of weighing up the next few
months of still being with you, still
waking up with you, of playing with the
kids, against the next few months of
seeing in your eyes how much my pain is
killing you; how my weakened body as it
ebbs away and you tend to it are your
final and lasting memories of me. I
won’t have that. Your final memories of
me will be us at the riverside, and
that dumb fishing game (which I think
they cheated at), and me inside of you,
and you on top of me, and barely a
fleeting thought of the darkness yet to
come. That was the best, Anne. A whole
day of not thinking about it. Dwell on
this day, baby, cos it was the best day
of my life. Kiss the girls for me, and
know that I’ve always loved you, and
maybe I’ll see you again if there’s
another place.

WILLOUGHBY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And if there ain’t, well, it’s been
Heaven knowing you. Your boy, Bill.

Early morning on Main Street, DIXON can be seen thru his
window, i-Pod earphones on.
57A

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - DAY

57A

DIXON at his desk, first one in, singing along quietly to
Abba’s ‘Chiquitita’.
COPS start coming in on the other side of room, and the ones
who aren’t in tears are when they’re told. DIXON is oblivious
to all this, and because we’re with his music, we don’t hear
the sound of it either.
DIXON looks up and finally notices something is amiss when he
sees a FELLOW COP smashing a chair to pieces and being
restrained by the DESK SERGEANT and two other COPS, as he
breaks down in tears. DIXON takes his earphones out.
DIXON
(laughing)
What the Hell’s going on around here?
All the COPS turn and look at him.
What?

DIXON (CONT’D)

INT. POLICE STATION, TOILET - DAY

DESK SERGEANT holds DIXON up at the sink he’s puking into,
nose streaming, crying quietly, dizzy.
DESK SERGEANT
Can you stand now?
DIXON
I can stand, I can stand...
DESK SERGEANT
I’d better get out there, say something
to ‘em. You ain’t gonna faint again,
are ya?
DIXON shakes his head. DESK SERGEANT goes out. DIXON cleans
himself up, looks at himself in the mirror, breathes deeply,
exits.

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - DAY

DIXON pulls on his jacket and looks out his window as the
DESK SERGEANT speaks...
POV OUT WINDOW: in his second storey window, WELBY sits at
his desk, chatting with PAMELA, who laughs at a joke he’s
made. END POV.
DESK SERGEANT
...that the best thing, the only thing,
to honor that man’s memory right now,
is to go to work. Is to be a good cop.
Is to walk in his shoes. Is to do what
he did, every day of his life. Help
people.
DIXON straps on his belt, picks up his night-stick and walks
out of the station. WE TRACK HIM IN ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT...
60

EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

...as he walks across the street, cars screeching to a halt,
to WELBY’s building. He smashes its glass door with his nightstick and carries on thru it, and we continue tracking him...
61

INT. WELBY’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

61

...as he walks up the stairs to the second floor, to WELBY in
the office, startled at the glass smashing. He backs away
from him...
RED
What the hell’s going on, Dixon?
DIXON clubs WELBY in the face and WELBY goes down, PAMELA
screaming. DIXON continues calmly to the window, smashes it
with the night-stick, picks WELBY up and shoves him out of
it.
WELBY disappears out the window, his screams remaining for a
second till they’re ended with a sickening thud.
PAMELA
You fucking pig! What the fuck are you
doing?!
DIXON clubs PAMELA across the face, breaking her nose. She
collapses, and he walks all the way back down-stairs and into
the street, and we continue to track him, as...

48.
62

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

62

...he comes out, sees WELBY, broken ankle/arm/hand, trying to
get up and crawl away. DIXON comes up behind, clubs him back
down...
DIXON
See, Red? I got issues with white folks
too...
DIXON calmly walks back into the police station, passing a
well-dressed black man, ABERCROMBIE, on his way.
DIXON (CONT’D)
The fuck are you looking at?
DIXON enters the station. ABERCROMBIE lowers his coffee, and
we see his cop’s badge as he takes in the carnage on the
street. END OF TRACKING SHOT

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

MILDRED and ROBBIE, fixing cornflakes and coffee, TV on in
b.g. The local news flashes back on, an image of WILLOUGHBY,
the ANCHOR announcing...
ANCHOR (TV)
Reports, sadly, have come in overnight,
that Chief William Willoughby of
Ebbing, Missouri, took his own life
early this morning...
MILDRED reacts like she’s been punched...
ANCHOR (TV) (CONT’D)
...in the grounds of his home. This
report just in from Gabriella
Forrester.
TV cuts to GABRIELLA (who interviewed MILDRED weeks back)
outside the WILLOUGHBY home, yellow cordon tape up, etc.
GABRIELLA (TV)
Tragedy came calling today upon this
quiet family home outside of Ebbing,
Missouri; a home belonging to Chief
William Willoughby, his wife, Anne, his
two young daughters, Polly and Jane.
What appears to be a self-inflicted
gunshot wound brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby, a man highlyrespected in Ebbing for his diligence
and his service to the community, a
service that lasted more than 25 years.
What led him to take his life in the
early hours of this morning it is too
early to speculate;
(MORE)

49.
GABRIELLA (TV) (CONT'D)
there were rumors of illness; could it
simply have been the pressure of the
job; or could it have something to do
with a story we ran here just two weeks
ago, of these billboards, and the woman
who put them there, Mildred Hayes...
MILDRED flips the TV off with the remote.
65

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

65

ROBBIE gets out of the car as a GROUP of TWO BOYS and ONE
GIRL stare over at MILDRED. Suddenly a can of Coke hits the
windscreen, from their direction. MILDRED looks at the fizz.
Don’t.

ROBBIE

MILDRED gets out of the car, walks over to one of the BOYS.
MILDRED
Say, do you know who threw that can?
What can?

BOY

MILDRED kicks him hard in the crotch. He goes down. She turns
to the GIRL next to him.
MILDRED
How about you, honey? Do you know who
threw that can?
GIRL
Uh, no, I didn’t really see...
MILDRED kicks her hard in the crotch. She goes down. She
stares at the other BOY, who kinda shudders. She goes back to
the car, gets in, speeds off.
ROBBIE
(under breath)
Thanks Mom.

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - DAY

DIXON’s FELLOW COPS slap him on the back in praise, as
ABERCROMBIE quietly enters and walks up to the DESK SERGEANT.
DESK SERGEANT
And what can I do for you today, Sir?
ABERCROMBIE
What’s your name?

50.
DESK SERGEANT
Name’s on my tag, man. You hard of
reading?
ABERCROMBIE
Hard of reading, no, no. That’s good,
“hard of reading”. It’s kind of like
“hard of hearing”, but it’s actually
it’s “hard of reading’, it’s like a
play on words or something.
DESK SERGEANT
What do you want?
ABERCROMBIE
Uh, I've been sent down to uh, take
over from Chief Willoughby, in light of
last night’s unfortunate event.
DIXON
(from back of room)
You have got to be fucking kidding me!
DESK SERGEANT
Do you have any documentation to prove
that, Sir?
ABERCROMBIE
You really wanna see my documentation,
fucker?
ABERCROMBIE stares at him, cold as ice.
DIXON
Yeah, see his documentation!
DESK SERGEANT backs down. ABERCROMBIE strolls up to DIXON’s
desk, all the other COPS watching.
ABERCROMBIE
(to the others)
None o’ you cracker motherfuckers got
no work to do?
COPS go back to work.
DIXON
(quietly)
Ain’t that racialist?
ABERCROMBIE sits on DIXON’s desk.
ABERCROMBIE
What happened to your hands there,
Officer Dixon?

51.
DIXON
Oh, I just kinda banged ‘em up a little
bit while I was throwing some guy out
of a fucking window. Y’know, the usual.
ABERCROMBIE
Oh yeah? They never taught me that one
at the Academy.
DIXON
Which fucking Academy you go to?
ABERCROMBIE looks over DIXON’s cluttered desk; his MOMMA’s
photo, toy figurines, ANGELA HAYES’ case file, a comic book.
ABERCROMBIE
How’s things coming along on the Angela
Hayes case?
DIXON
How’s things coming along on the ‘Mind
your own fucking business’ case?
ABERCROMBIE
How things coming along on the hand me
your gun and your badge?
DIXON snorts, then, as he realises he means it, is sickened.
Huh?

DIXON

ABERCROMBIE
Hand me your gun and your badge.
DIXON’s eyes well up. ABERCROMBIE just stares right past him.
DIXON gives ABERCROMBIE his gun, then checks himself for his
badge. He can’t find it. He goes thru all his pockets,
embarrassed, as ABERCROMBIE waits. Still can’t find it.
DIXON
I can’t find my badge. No, seriously.
Maybe I dropped it when I was doing the
window guy?
ABERCROMBIE
Just get out of my station house, man.
DIXON rises, sadly. Looks to his FELLOW COPS. Who look away.
ABERCROMBIE enters WILLOUGHBY’s office, slams the door behind
him. DIXON shuffles up to the DESK SERGEANT.
DIXON
I think I just got fired. Fired or
suspended, I’m not sure which...
Fired.

DESK SERGEANT

52.
DIXON looks at him, eyes welling up. He nods, and leaves
before he starts crying.

INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

68

A pick-up truck pulls up outside. MILDRED, reading a
magazine, watches as a well-built, CROP-HAIRED GUY, late
20’s, enters, kinda stares straight at her a moment, then
ambles around the shop, looking at knickknacks he obviously
has no use for.
MILDRED
Anything I can help you with, just
gimme a holler.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
(pause)
Give you a what?
A holler?

MILDRED

He stares at her again, then continues with the knickknacks.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
A holler, huh?
(pause)
Give Mildred Hayes a holler. Okay.
You know me?

MILDRED

CROP-HAIRED GUY
Only from the TV, and the radio. How
much these here ‘Welcome to Missouri’
rabbits go for?
MILDRED
Seven bucks. It’s writ right on ‘em.
GUY tosses a glass rabbit against a distant shelf, where it,
and the things on the shelf, shatter, startling MILDRED.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Guess he ain’t seven bucks now.
MILDRED
What the Hell was it you come in here
for?
CROP-HAIRED GUY
What did I come in here for? Well,
maybe I’m a good friend of
Willoughby’s, how about that?
Are you?

MILDRED

53.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Or, y’know... maybe I was a friend of
your daughter’s or something. How about
that?
MILDRED
(pause)
Were you?
CROP-HAIRED MAN
Or, uh, y’know, maybe I was the guy who
fucked her while she was dying? How
about that?
They stare at each other a while.
Were you?

MILDRED

CROP-HAIRED GUY
Oh... Naw. I would’ve liked to. I saw
her picture in the paper there.
Door bell tinkles, as ANNE enters, dressed in black.
CROP-HAIRED GUY (CONT’D)
Saved by the bell, huh?
GUY turns to leave.
MILDRED
You owe me seven fucking dollars for
the rabbit.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Guess you’ll have to get it off me next
time I’m passing through, huh Mildred?
MILDRED
I guess I will.
GUY exits. ANNE, who she’s never seen before, comes up.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
You don’t know how glad I am to see
you.
What?!

ANNE

MILDRED
That guy was scaring me.
ANNE
I wouldn’t have said you scare easy.

54.
MILDRED
I ain’t the worst. What can I do for
you, ma’am?
ANNE
My husband left this for you before he
shot himself in the head last night.
ANNE hands her the letter, as MILDRED just stares at her.
MILDRED
I’m sorry, Mrs Willoughby...
ANNE
Are you? Are you really?
Of course...

MILDRED

ANNE
Surely it’s the perfect ending for you,
isn’t it? It’s proof that they’ve been
successful, these billboards of yours,
isn’t it, a dead policeman? It’s
quantifiable now.
MILDRED
Are you blaming this on me?
ANNE
No, I’m not blaming this on you. I just
came to give you the letter. Now, my
two little girls are out in the car, so
I’d better not stay and chat. I’m not
sure what we’re going to do for the
rest of the day. It’s hard to know what
to do the day your husband kills
himself. It’s hard to know what to do.
ANNE leaves. MILDRED looks out as she drives away - and sees
POLLY and JANE looking back at her thru the rear window.
MILDRED rests her head on the glass door a second, the broken
‘WELCOME TO MISSOURI’ rabbit on the shelf beside her, its
head split in two. She opens the letter in her hand and
starts reading, as dusk falls on the street outside.
WILLOUGHBY
Dear Mildred, Dead Man Willoughby here.
Firstly I wanted to apologise for dying
without catching your daughter’s
killer. It’s a source of great pain to
me, and it would break my heart to
think you thought I didn’t care, cos I
did care. There are just some cases...

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DUSK

The billboards and surrounding landscape from various angles
at sunset; including details like the half-eaten flowers and
the insects thereon; the burnt patch of dirt; and the
billboards themselves.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...where you never catch a break, then
five years down the line some guy hears
some other guy bragging about it in a
bar-room or a jail-cell and the whole
thing is wrapped up thru sheer
stupidity. I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do. Second, I
gotta admit, Mildred, the billboards
were a great fucking idea. They were
like a chess move. And although they
had absolutely nothing to do with my
dying, I’m sure that everyone in town
will assume that they did, which is
why, for Willoughby’s counter-move, I
decided to pay the next month’s rent on
‘em. I thought it’d be funny, you
having to defend ‘em a whole nuther
month after they’ve stuck me in the
ground. The joke is on you, Mildred, ha
ha, and I hope they do not kill you. So
good luck with all that, and good luck
with everything else too. I hope and I
pray that you get him.

EXT. DIXON’S HOUSE - DUSK

DIXON and MOMMA sitting on their porch at sunset, with beers.
MOMMA
Well, do you want me to go down and
talk to them?
DIXON
No I don’t want you to go down and talk
to them. Jesus! Somebody sending their
goddam mother down to talk to the
goddam police, for Christ’s sakes.
(pause)
And say what?
MOMMA
And say to give you your job back. And
to get rid of the black guy.
DIXON
They ain’t gonna listen to some guy’s
mother, asking them to get rid of some
black guy. Things have moved on in The
South!

56.
MOMMA
Well it shouldn’t’ve!
(pause)
Will they give you any money for being
laid off an’ all?
DIXON
I don’t know what the compensation
scheme is for when you throw a guy out
of a window, Mom. I guess I shoulda
looked into that beforehand. Let me
Google that!
MOMMA
A couple grand, maybe? You’ve been
there three years. Not counting the
five years at the Academy. Six if you
count the year you were held back.
DIXON pulls on his jacket.
MOMMA (CONT’D)
Where ya going?
DIXON
None of your business.
MOMMA
Off to see your fancy woman?
DIXON
I don’t got a fancy woman.
MOMMA
Yeah. I know!
He gives her a dirty look.
DIXON
You wanna watch yourself.
MOMMA
Or you’ll do what?
DIXON
Blow your goddam head off.
MOMMA laughs loudly. Dixon gets in his car and drives off.

EXT. ROAD APPROACHING BILLBOARDS - CONTINUOUS

71A

MILDRED and ROBBIE, driving a road adjacent to the billboard
road, the billboards not yet in sight.
ROBBIE
Oh, did you hear the news?

57.

What news?

MILDRED

ROBBIE
That Dixon guy threw that Welby guy out
his window this morning.
MILDRED
You’re shitting me. Is Welby okay?
ROBBIE shrugs. MILDRED is sick to her stomach, and just when
it seems like things can’t get any worse, she turns onto the
Billboard Road and suddenly sees...
MILDRED (CONT’D)
You’re shitting me!
...ALL THREE OF THE BILLBOARDS ARE ON FIRE. MILDRED speeds
towards them...
72

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT

72

We speed towards the fiery billboards; the third totally
ablaze, the second half-ablaze, words still legible, the
first just getting going. MILDRED grabs the car’s
extinguisher...
MILDRED
Go get the one from the house!
ROBBIE
Shouldn’t I call the fire department?
MILDRED
Fuck the fire department! They probably
started it!
ROBBIE
Well don’t do anything stupid!
But MILDRED’s already racing towards the first billboard,
spraying it all over from close up. ROBBIE speeds off.
MILDRED keeps spraying like a madwoman...
MILDRED
(quietly)
Scumbags, scumbags, scumbags. Fucking
scumbags.
...and finally gets the first billboard out, then sprints all
the way to the second, starts in on that. It’s harder this
time - the flames already halfway up.
She gets an idea, concentrates all her efforts on the left
side post alone and, as it starts going out, she starts
climbing up it, putting out the fire bit by bit as she goes.

58.
Finally, all the left hand post is out and, though her hands
are burnt, she gets to the top of the billboard and starts
walking along it, spraying down along its length.
This starts to work, flames edging back, until tsss tsss, the
extinguisher runs out of stuff. She tosses it violently at
the flames and stays standing there, staring at them, as the
flames slowly start to rise towards her again.
Suddenly, ROBBIE pulls up, jumps out of the car and starts in
on the flames below her.
ROBBIE
What the hell are you doing, Mom?!
The flames start to come under control as MILDRED climbs
back down. ROBBIE has the second billboard out by the time
she’s down, but the distant third is still raging. MILDRED
starts marching off towards it...
Come on...

MILDRED

ROBBIE
Leave it, Ma. It’s too late.
MILDRED storms back and tries to grab the extinguisher off
him, but he won’t let it go. It’s paining her burnt hands
terribly, but she keeps trying.
ROBBIE (CONT’D)
Mom, leave it, please!
PAUSE. MILDRED makes one final effort. This time ROBBIE lets
it be taken. She strides off to the third billboard, totally
engulfed in massive flame. He watches her start in on it,
sighs, then heads off towards her, to try and help.
73

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT

73

LATER. The fires out, the billboards smouldering. FIREMEN and
COPS idling. MILDRED’s hands are being treated by a MEDIC, as
ROBBIE looks on. ABERCROMBIE comes over.
ABERCROMBIE
How are those hands?
She ignores him. The MEDIC moves off.
ABERCROMBIE (CONT’D)
Can I ask you a coupla questions?
MILDRED
You can ask me all the questions you
want if you take me down and arrest me.

59.
ABERCROMBIE
I’m not gonna arrest you, Mrs Hayes. I
got nothing to arrest you for.
MILDRED
Not yet you ain’t.
She walks off towards the second billboard and the car.
ABERCROMBIE
(to ROBBIE)
We ain’t all the enemy, y'know?
76

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - MORNING

76

MILDRED lying awake, thinking. She slowly sits up, slips her
feet into her fluffy BUNNY RABBIT SLIPPERS at bedside, and
sits there a while; worn out, angry, depressed.
MILDRED
(quietly)
I’ll crucify the motherfuckers.
(crying)
I’ll crucify the motherfuckers.
She flexes her toes in her bunny slippers, and the bunny
noses look like they’re sniffing. It hits her how incongruous
the image is in regard to what she’s saying. She smiles.
MILDRED’s POV: of rabbit slippers, noses sniffing again.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
(rabbit voice)
What are you gonna do to ‘em, Mildred?
You’re gonna crucify ‘em, you say?
(normal voice)
That’s right, I’m gonna crucify ‘em.
(rabbit voice)
Who you gonna crucify? The
motherfuckers?
(normal voice)
That’s right, the motherfuckers.
(rabbit voice)
Jeez! Well, I guess those motherfuckers
better watch out then, huh?
(normal voice)
Fucking A!
77

I/E. CAR DRIVING BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY

77

MILDRED and ROBBIE approaching the burned out, blackened
billboards, and see GABRIELLA and her NEWS CREW at the second
of them. They slow down to a crawl, to listen...
MILDRED
What’s this shit...?

*

60.
78

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD, SECOND BILLBOARD - CONTINUOUS

78

GABRIELLA continuing, doing a little walk past the billboard
for the camera, which pans with her...
GABRIELLA
...and as sad as the spectacle of these
burned out billboards might be, in
light of the death of Chief Willoughby,
this reporter for one can’t help but
wonder whether this finally puts an end
to the strange saga of the three
billboards outside of Eb...
MILDRED calling from the car...
MILDRED
This don’t put an end to shit, you
fucking retard, this is just the
fucking start, so why don’t you put
that on your “Good Morning Missouri
fucking Wake-Up Broadcast”, bitch!
MILDRED drives off at speed from the open-mouthed GABRIELLA,
who finally gives the CAMERAMAN the sign to cut.
79

EXT. DIXON’S HOUSE - DAY

79

DIXON reading a comic book on the porch, beer in hand. MOMMA
comes out, worried.
MOMMA
I see on the TV there was a buncha
fires lit outside o’ town last night.
DIXON
Buncha fires, huh?
MOMMA
Out at those billboards.
DIXON
Yeah, well, back when I was a cop I
woulda been interested in who set those
fires cos, technically, that’s arson,
but as I am no longer employed by those
people I don’t really give a good god
damn, now do I?
Telephone rings, they look at each other. DIXON goes into the
house and gets it.
DIXON (CONT’D)
The Dixon residence. Oh, hey Sarge! How
you doing? You got any news?

61.
DESK SERGEANT (O.S.)
News about what?
DIXON
I dunno, about my job and stuff?
80

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

80

DESK SERGEANT at desk, squad room busy, ABERCROMBIE talking
to other COPS in b.g.
DESK SERGEANT
No, no. What? No. Anne Willoughby just
dropped in a letter that Bill wrote you
before he died.
81

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

81

DIXON
Oh my God! What’s it say?
DESK SERGEANT (O.S.)
I haven’t read it, Dixon, it’s not my
letter.
DIXON
Oh. Well, I’ll come right down...
82

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

82

DESK SERGEANT looks at the distant ABERCROMBIE and the COPS
listening to him...
DESK SERGEANT
Well, uh... I don’t think that’d be
such a great idea, as things stand,
Jason. Uh, you’ve still got your keys
to the station-house though, right?
Yeah.

DIXON (O.S.)

DESK SERGEANT
Well, why don’t you just come pick it
up when everyone’s gone home. I can
leave it on your desk for ya.
83

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Oh. Okay.

DIXON

83

62.
DESK SERGEANT (O.S.)
Actually, yeah, then when you’re done
you can just leave your keys, save us
picking ‘em up later.
DIXON nods, so he won’t have to cry.
85

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

85

The dark street at night. Inside the lowered blinds of the
police station there’s the faint glow of a flashlight.
85A

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

85A

DIXON in the dark, empty station with a flashlight, eating
Doritos, headphones on, looks at the “OFFICER JASON DIXON”
envelope on his desk, beside Angela’s file. He opens it.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
Jason, Willoughby here. I’m dead now,
sorry about that, but there’s something
I wanted to say to you that I never
really said when I was alive. I think
you’ve got the makings of being a
really good cop, Jason, and you know
why? Because, deep down, you’re a
decent man. I know you don’t think I
think that, but I do, Dipshit. You play
hopscotch when you think no-one’s
looking, for Christ’s sakes...
86

EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

86

Street deserted as MILDRED, with backpack, checks to see noone’s watching then slips inside thru the taped up door of
WELBY’s offices.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
I do think you’re too angry, though,..
87

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

87

MILDRED at WELBY’s desk in his swivel chair, phone-book open
to ‘Ebbing Police Precinct House’, telephone to her ear,
backpack on table, broken window looking out on the dark
police station across the street.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...And I know it’s all since your dad
died and you had to go look after your
Mom and all...

63.
88

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

88

Telephone on DESK SERGEANT’s desk starts ringing, red light
flashing, but as DIXON still has his headphones on he can’t
hear it. Phone stops ringing after a while.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...But as long as you hold onto so much
hate then I don’t think you’re ever
going to become...
89

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

89

MILDRED gets up and exits frame with her backpack, leaving
just the table, window and the police station in shot. SOUND
ONLY of four clinking bottles taken out of backpack. MILDRED
moves back into shot, looks at the phone again.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...What I know you wanna become...
90

INT. POLICE STATION, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

90

DIXON walking around the station, reading tearfully. Passes
DESK SERGEANT’s desk, as phone starts ringing again. He still
can’t hear it. After five or six rings it stops.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...A Detective.
91

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

91

MILDRED looks at the phone she’s just put down, thinking,
rolling a cigarette lighter around in her hand, thumbing the
flint but not lighting it, until...
Fuck ‘em!

MILDRED

She lights the lighter, and we pan with her and finally see
the FOUR MOLOTOV COCKTAILS she’s placed on the table.
She quickly picks up and lights the first, moves to the
window and launches it high out across the street. It
explodes BELOW DIXON’S WINDOW, setting it and the whole wall
alight.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
Cos you know what you need to become a
detective? And I know you’re gonna
wince when I say this...

64.
92

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

92

DIXON hasn’t noticed the sound or the flames. He turns the
letter to the 2nd page.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...But what you need to become a
detective... is Love.
DIXON winces.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
Because thru Love comes Calm, and thru
Calm comes Thought. And you need
Thought to detect stuff sometimes,
Jason. It’s kinda all you need.
93

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

93

MILDRED tosses the second Molotov out...
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
You don’t even need a gun. And you
definitely don’t need Hate.
94

EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

94

It hits the SECOND STOREY WINDOWS, setting them alight.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
Hate never solved nothing...
95

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

95

DIXON is wrapped up in the letter, chewing his fingernails,
flames leaping behind him...
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
But Calm did. And Thought did. Try it.
Try it just for a change. No-one’ll
think you’re gay.
96

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

96

MILDRED tosses the third Molotov out...
97

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
Third Molotov hits THE POLICE STATION DOOR, setting it
alight.

97

65.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
And if they do, arrest ‘em for
homophobia! Won’t they be surprised!
98

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

98

Flames still leap outside DIXON’s window as DIXON, his back
to it, keeps reading.
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
Good luck to you, Jason. You’re a
decent man, and yeah you’ve had a run
of bad luck...
99

INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

99

IN SLOWMO, MILDRED tosses out the final Molotov...
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
...But things are gonna change for
you...
100

EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

100

IN SLOWMO, the Molotov arcs up across the street...
WILLOUGHBY (V.O.)
I can feel it.
...and IN NORMAL SPEED, SMASHES IN THRU DIXON’S WINDOW...
101

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

101

DIXON finally notices this one, as it explodes behind him and
knocks him off his feet, his desk and that whole side of the
room set ablaze. He sees that the station door is on fire
also, blocking his exit, and the ANGELA HAYES file on his
desk on fire too.
He grabs and pats it against himself, getting the flames out
but getting petrol all over himself in the process.
DIXON looks around, checks a locked back door, and realises
there is no way out of the building other than thru his own
the fiery broken window.
Calm. Calm.

DIXON

Standing in front of the window, he looks down at the file,
places it safely up inside his shirt, hugs it tightly to his
chest, takes a few steps back, then makes a running leap,
headfirst thru the flames and out the window.

66.
102

EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

102

DIXON lands on the sidewalk in a heap, his clothes all
alight. He quickly pulls the case file out from under his
shirt and tosses it as far away from the flames as he can.
It lands in a clean spot, no flames touching it, which can’t
be said for DIXON. He rolls around, trying to put himself
out, but it’s just making it worse, he’s like a fireball...
Across the street, MILDRED comes out of the WELBY building
and sees him, horrified, just as JAMES turns a far corner and
sees DIXON on fire and MILDRED in the doorway.
He sprints over and beats out the flames with his hands and
clothes but DIXON’s head, hands and body are badly charred.
MILDRED turns away from him, horrified, and sees the case
file lying there, and realises what DIXON has done, as the
sirens and blue lights of the AMBULANCE and FIREMEN arrive.
103

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAWN

103

LATER. Fire almost out, building ravaged. MILDRED sits
exhausted on the sidewalk outside WELBY’s, JAMES beside her,
looking at her suspiciously. She looks away. ABERCROMBIE
comes over.
ABERCROMBIE
(to MILDRED)
So what did you see?
JAMES
Well when we turned the corner from
Spring, the fire was already raging,
so, and then two seconds later the cop
guy just jumps out the window...
ABERCROMBIE
Wait, the two of you turned the corner
from Spring? Where were you before
this?
JAMES
Round at my place.
ABERCROMBIE
You two are boyfriend and girlfriend?
JAMES
Well, it’s early stages, y’know.
ABERCROMBIE
(to MILDRED)
That right?
MILDRED
We’ve had a couple dates.

67.
ABERCROMBIE moves off, suspicious.
JAMES
So you wanna go out to dinner next
week?
MILDRED
I’ll go out to dinner with ya. But I
ain’t gonna fuck ya.
She heads off.
JAMES
Well, I ain’t gonna fuck you neither.
(quietly)
I guess.
104

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

104

WELBY reading. A man, face and body bandaged (it’s DIXON,
though WELBY can’t see this) is wheeled in by a NURSE.
NURSE
(to WELBY)
Burn victim. He’s pretty heavily
sedated.
NURSE leaves. WELBY hobbles over to take a look. Half DIXON’s
hair is gone and only his eyes are visible thru the bandages.
RED
Hey man? You doing okay? Jeez, you got
burned up pretty bad. You’ll be okay
though, don’t worry. You want a glass
of orange juice? I got a straw
somewheres...
The eyes behind the bandages start to cry.
RED (CONT’D)
Hey man, don’t cry. You’ll be okay.
DIXON
I’m sorry, Welby.
RED
(pause)
You know me?
I’m sorry.

DIXON

RED
Sorry for what, man?
DIXON
For throwing you out the window.

68.
WELBY realises finally, starts backing away.
Save it.
I’m sorry.

RED
DIXON

RED
I don’t care. And stop crying. The
salt’ll just fuck up your wounds.
DIXON
I thought salt was supposed to be good
for wounds.
RED
Well what am I, a fucking doctor?!
WELBY goes back to his bed. Sound of DIXON still crying.
DIXON’S POV: Thru bandages, of the ceiling, him crying still.
Then the SOUND of liquid pouring. Then the SOUND of shuffling
steps. Then the POV catches WELBY, limping over. Carrying a
glass of orange juice. He places it beside DIXON’s bed and
puts a straw in it.
POV follows WELBY a little way back to his bed then drifts to
the ceiling and remains there. As his crying continues.
106

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A knock on the front door. MILDRED looks out thru the
spyhole, doesn’t recognise JEROME, who knocks again.
Who is it?

MILDRED

JEROME (O.S.)
Oh you don’t know me really.
MILDRED
Well what you want?
JEROME (O.S.)
I come about the billboards.
MILDRED
What about ‘em?
JEROME (O.S.)
They got burned up.
I know that.

MILDRED

106

69.
JEROME (O.S.)
I’m one of the guys who put the ‘em up
in the first place.
MILDRED opens door, safety latch on, vaguely recognises
JEROME.
Jerome.

JEROME (CONT’D)

They shake fingers thru the door.
MILDRED
What can I do for ya, Jerome?
JEROME
Well, y’know, when you’re putting up a
buncha posters like that, just in case
any of ‘em gets screwed up or torn,
they give ya a set of duplicates,
y’know?
JEROME shows her what he’s brought up. Thru the crack in the
door she sees two big card rolls full of posters.
MILDRED
(smiling)
No, I didn’t know that.
107

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD, SECOND BILLBOARD - DAY

107

Later that day. MILDRED and ROBBIE sloshing up the posters on
the ‘AND STILL NO ARRESTS’ billboard, as, distantly, JEROME
is finishing up with the first billboard. JAMES is holding
MILDRED’s ladder steady, looking up at her.
MILDRED
Ladder’s pretty steady as it is, there,
James.
JAMES
Oh, I don’t mind. I like holding
ladders. It takes me out of myself.
MILDRED sighs. A car pulls up. Out gets DENISE.
Need a hand?

DENISE

Squealing, MILDRED gets down, gives her a hug.
MILDRED
When’d you get out?
DENISE
Hour ago. Judge threw it out, said the
arrest report weren’t filled out right.
(MORE)

70.
DENISE (CONT'D)
Say, you didn’t burn down the police
station, did ya?
No...

MILDRED

JAMES
No. She was with me the whole night.
DENISE looks at MILDRED.
MILDRED
(shakes head,
mouthing)
It’s a long story.
JEROME comes up, having finished the first billboards. DENISE
eyes him up, thinks he’s cute, it’s mutual, and they exchange
a ‘Hi’. JEROME holds up a part of the WILLOUGHBY poster.
JEROME
You sure you still wanna put up the
Willoughby one, him dead an’ all?
MILDRED
Why not? He paid for it.
108

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DUSK

108

Some weeks later. A grey and windy evening. The posters all
up beautifully, though the burned billboards look like they
could crumble any second.
109

INT. BAR - NIGHT

109

DIXON slouched low in a booth, morose, bandages gone, but his
burns still visible. In a distant corner, JEROME and DENISE
chat quietly.
A truck pulls up outside. The CROP-HAIRED GUY and a male PAL
enter, order a couple of beers from TONY and sit in the booth
behind DIXON, not noticing him.
110

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

110

MILDRED and JAMES at dinner at a nice restaurant, WAITER
pouring wine. CHARLIE and PENELOPE enter and pass, CHARLIE
smiling at the sight of MILDRED with a dwarf. MILDRED has a
fleeting look of embarrassment, which JAMES registers.
Who’s that?

JAMES

*

71.
MILDRED
My ex-husband. And his nineteen year
old girlfriend.
JAMES
You wanna leave?
MILDRED
No, no. A deal’s a deal.
MILDRED smiles. JAMES only partly reciprocates.
111

INT. BAR - NIGHT

111

Murmured conversation behind DIXON as he peels the label off
his beer.
CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)
It was fucking wild, man, I think I was
certifiably fucking insane for a while
back there.
PAL (O.S.)
When was this?
CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)
Bout nine, ten months ago.
PAL (O.S.)
Were you on your own or what?
DIXON is barely listening, as DENISE is staring hatefully at
him from across the bar. He ignores her, slugs some beer, as
the conversation behind him continues.
CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)
No, had a coupla buddies with me.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

PAL (O.S.)
CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)

PAL (O.S.)
They fuck her too?
CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)
I think they got their kicks just
watching, you know.
Was she hot?

PAL (O.S.)

CROP-HAIRED GUY (O.S.)
After the gasoline kicked in she was
hot.

72.
DIXON’s listening now. He gets up and ambles past their
booth, to get an idea of who’s talking, but they clam up as
they notice him passing.
112

EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

112

DIXON continues on out of the bar, lights a cigarette in
trembling hands, takes out a pen, and makes a note of the
TRUCK’S LICENSE PLATE. Finishes the cigarette, goes back
inside.
113

INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

113

DIXON ambles past their booth again, coming in on...
CROP-HAIRED GUY
I ain’t going down for that shit, last
fucking day down there...
GUY shuts up again as DIXON sits back in his booth.
CROP-HAIRED GUY (CONT’D)
(quietly)
He been there the whole time?
Who?

PAL

CROP-HAIRED GUY
Burnt-face-Jake. Keeps fucking walking
up and down.
PAL
I don’t know. I don’t think so.
GUY goes to the bar and turns to get a good look at DIXON,
who just stares at his beer. GUY gets two more beers and
returns to his own booth, staring at him the whole way. DIXON
gets up, ambles to the bar, glancing at the GUY as he goes.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Can I help you with something, man?
You’ve been looking over here all
fucking night, now, unless you got
something to say to me, why don’t you
take your burnt fucking face and get
the fuck outta here, okay?
Pause. DIXON goes over and sits in beside PAL, nudging him
over, facing the GUY.
CROP-HAIRED GUY (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you doing?!
DIXON
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

73.
DIXON holds his hands up, back and front, so the GUY can see
there’s nothing in them, and that he means no harm.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Just trust me, okay?
DIXON reaches out with his empty right hand, slowly puts it
behind GUY’s right ear, GUY flinching slightly, exchanging a
glance with PAL.
DIXON (CONT’D)
Just trust me...
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Just do the fucking trick.
DIXON smiles, then quickly and deeply rakes his long
fingernails down the GUY’s cheek, leaving a couple of deep
bloody lines there.
GUY and PAL spring at DIXON, pummelling him horrifically,
reopening all his wounds.
DIXON doesn’t fight back at all, in fact he just clutches his
fists to his chest to protect them. The two keep going and
going, stamping on him sickeningly. JEROME stands up...
JEROME
Hey! That’s enough now!
GUY approaches, menacingly...
CROP-HAIRED GUY
What’s it to ya, fucker?
JEROME
The guy’s a cop man! He’s a cop!
CROP-HAIRED GUY
Oh yeah? He ain’t wearing no badge.
DIXON
(thru blood)
I lost my badge. I can’t remember where
I lost it.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
You started this, man! I didn’t do shit
to you.
DIXON
I know I started it. I scratched you up
like a bitch.
CROP-HAIRED GUY
That’s exactly fucking right...

74.
GUY kicks DIXON viciously in the head and exits with PAL,
leaving DIXON lying there. Unmoving.
114

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

114

MILDRED and JAMES finishing their starters.
JAMES
Gotta use the little boys’ room.
JAMES goes off to the toilet. CHARLIE comes over, leaving
PENELOPE hanging, sits in JAMES’ seat, smiling.
MILDRED
You got something to say to me?
CHARLIE
If I’d known, we coulda double-dated.
MILDRED
Doesn’t shitgirl have a curfew
weeknights?
CHARLIE
No, no, in fact I was actually gonna
take her to the circus later, but
there’s no need now. Does he juggle?
MILDRED
I’m having one dinner with the guy cos
he did me a favor, okay?
CHARLIE
You don’t have to explain yourself to
me cos you’re having dinner with a
midget, Mildred.
MILDRED
I’m not explaining myself to you.
CHARLIE
You kinda are.
Across the room, PENELOPE makes a gesture about being left
alone, as JAMES comes back, sees CHARLIE in his seat.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Listen, I didn’t come over to break
your balls, you can date as many
midgets as you want. No, I came over to
say I was sorry, actually.
MILDRED
Sorry for what?
JAMES gets back onto his chair as CHARLIE gets out of it.

75.
CHARLIE
I’m sorry about what happened to your
billboards an’ all.
MILDRED
Yeah well, that’s all water under the
bridge now, I guess.
CHARLIE
Good. I’m glad. I was pretty drunk, but
it still don’t excuse it.
MILDRED just stares at him.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
All this anger, man, Penelope said to
me the other day, it just begets
greater anger, y’know? And it’s true.
JAMES
Penelope said ‘Begets’?
CHARLIE
Yeah, ‘It begets greater anger’.
(to JAMES)
Well, you take care of this little
lady, okay sport? Big lady, compared to
you, right?
CHARLIE returns to his table. Silence between JAMES and
MILDRED a while.
You alright?

JAMES

MILDRED
I think I’d like to go home now.
JAMES just stares at her.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
Aw don’t gimme any shit, James? We can
do this another time, alright?
JAMES
Why would I wanna do this another time?
You’ve been embarrassed to be here ever
since we arrived.
MILDRED
Oh for Christ’s sakes, James. I didn’t
force you to come on this date,
alright? You forced me.
JAMES
Forced you? I asked you on a date. Wow!
Well, y’know, I know I ain’t much of a
catch, okay?
(MORE)

76.
JAMES (CONT'D)
I know I’m a midget who sells used cars
and has a drinking problem, I know
that. But who the hell are you, man?
You’re that Billboard Lady who never
ever smiles, who never has a good word
to say about anybody, and who, in the
eveningtimes, SETS FUCKING FIRE TO
POLICE STATIONS! And I’M the one who’s
not a catch?!
JAMES climbs down off his chair...
James...

MILDRED

JAMES
I didn’t have to come and hold your
ladder!
JAMES leaves in tears, leaving MILDRED drained. She glances at
CHARLIE. He’s smirking at the scene. MILDRED picks up her wine
glass, picks up her half-empty bottle, and, holding it low at
her side, slowly walks over to him. He loses his smile.
CHARLIE
Now don’t make a scene.
She looks the two of them over, bottle still in hand.
MILDRED
(to PENELOPE)
Did you really tell him “Anger begets
greater anger”?
PENELOPE
Oh! Yes! I did! I didn’t make it up
myself though. I can’t claim that! No,
I read it on a bookmark.
(pause)
Which was in a book I was reading.
(pause)
About polio.
(pause)
Polo. No, which is the one with the
horses? Polio? Polo.
Polo.
Polo!

CHARLIE
PENELOPE

MILDRED looks at them a moment... then places the bottle on
the table for them to finish.
MILDRED
Be nice to her, Charlie. You got that?

77.
CHARLIE nods imperceptibly. MILDRED leaves.

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

118

DIXON staggers in, blood-soaked, past his horrified MOMMA.
Jason!

MOMMA

DIXON
Just leave me, Momma, don’t look at me.
MOMMA
(crying)
Jason! What have they done to you?
118A

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

118A

DIXON gets to the bathroom, slams door behind him, still
clutching his right hand to his chest. He looks at himself in
the cabinet mirror a second, repulsed by what he sees.
He opens the cabinet mirror left-handed, rifles thru shelves,
finds an unopened tweezer set, then finds a small clean glass
vial, a blank label on it.
He sits on the bath and very slowly uses the tweezers to
scrape out all the CROP-HAIRED GUY’S BLOOD AND SKIN trapped
underneath the fingernails of his right hand, and carefully
places each amount inside the vial.
Once all five fingernails are done he caps the vial and, pen
in shaky hand, writes on its label ‘H5T371, IDAHO’.
Finished, he clutches it to his chest and sinks to the floor,
shaking violently, MOMMA calling out, banging on the door.
MOMMA (O.S.)
Jason?! Jason?!
DIXON
I’m gonna be alright, Momma. It’s all
gonna be alright.

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAY

120

MILDRED, glass of wine on couch, TV on but not really
watching. Knock at the door. She goes to get it. Looks thru
the spyhole.
SPYHOLE POV: Convex DIXON, new scars, bandages and a beanie.

78.
121

EXT. MILDRED’S GARDEN - DAY

121

MILDRED sitting on swing-set, DIXON with beanie in hand, a
repeat of Willoughby and his hat from long ago.
DIXON
I don’t wanna get your hopes up,
alright, but there’s a guy, and I think
he might be the guy. I got his DNA. I
got a lot of it, actually. They’re
making the checks as we speak.
MILDRED
He’s in jail?
DIXON
No, but he ain’t gonna be hard to find.
MILDRED
Why do you think he’s the guy?
DIXON
I heard him talking about something
that he did to a girl in the middle of
last year. I couldn’t hear all of it,
but it sounded a lot like what happened
to Angela. Then he beat the crap outta
me. But cos of that I got a bunch of
his DNA. So I wanted to let you know
sooner rather than later. I didn’t want
you to give up hope, y’know?
MILDRED
I’ve been trying not to.
DIXON
Well, all you can do is try, as my
Momma says. Not so much about hope as
about... well, I didn’t used to be very
good at English at school, so it was
more “All you can do is try... to not
be so crap at English.” Cos you need
English, really, if you wanna be a cop.
If you wanna be anything, really.
(pause)
Unless you live in Mexico or something.
But who wants that?
He gets up to go.
MILDRED
Hey Dixon?
(pause)
Thanks.
He smiles, and she watches him drive away, out past the
billboards. She sits there a while, thinking.

INT. POLICE STATION, WILLOUGHBY’S OFFICE - DAY

126

In the burnt-out office, DIXON is sitting down. ABERCROMBIE
closes the office door and sits across from him.
ABERCROMBIE
You did good, Jason. You did real good.
But he wasn’t the guy.

What?

DIXON
(stunned)

ABERCROMBIE
There was no match to the DNA, no
matches to any other crimes of this
nature, to any crimes at all, in fact.
And his record is clean. Maybe he was
just bragging.
DIXON
He wasn’t just bragging.
ABERCROMBIE
Well, that’s as may be. But at the time
of Angela’s death he wasn’t even in the
country.
DIXON
Where was he?
ABERCROMBIE
But I’ve seen his records of entry and
exit to the States, and I’ve spoken to
his Commanding Officer. He wasn’t in
the country, Dixon. He ain’t our guy.
DIXON
He might not be our guy, but he still
done something shitty.
ABERCROMBIE
Not in Missouri he didn’t.
DIXON
Where was he?
ABERCROMBIE
That’s classified information.
DIXON
Come on, man.

*

80.
ABERCROMBIE
If the guy’s got a Commanding Officer,
and if the guy got back to the country
nine months ago, and if the country
where he was is classified, which
country do you think he was in?
(pause)
I’ll give you a clue. It was sandy.
DIXON
That doesn’t really narrow it down.
ABERCROMBIE
All you need to know is, he didn’t do
nothing to Angela Hayes. So we’re gonna
keep looking. Alright?
Pause. DIXON takes out his badge, shows it to ABERCROMBIE.
DIXON
I found my badge after all.
DIXON looks at it a few seconds, then slides it across the
table to ABERCROMBIE, and leaves.
127

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

127

MOMMA asleep, open-mouthed, on couch, TV on. DIXON watches
her a while, then dials a number on the phone, which he then
carries into his MOM’s bedroom, sitting on her bed. We now
see that he has a shotgun in his hand.
129

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT

129

MILDRED trudging the dirt at the billboards, replacing the
dead pot plants. At the third billboard, her cellphone rings.
Hello?
It’s Dixon.

MILDRED
DIXON (O.S.)

MILDRED
(pause)
Tell me.
DIXON (O.S.)
(pause)
He wasn’t the guy.
MILDRED crumples down beside the burnt patch of ground. She
cries a quiet while, lets out a long, cold breath, then picks
the phone back up.

81.
MILDRED
I guess you’re sure, right?
DIXON (O.S.)
He, um, he wasn’t even in the country
when it happened. So, whatever he did,
he didn’t do it round here.
(pause)
I’m sorry I got your hopes up.
MILDRED
It’s alright. At least I had a day of
hoping. Which is more than I’ve had for
a while. I’d better go.
129A

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

129A

DIXON idly taps the shotgun against his lips.
DIXON
Um, there was one thing I was thinking.
What’s that?

MILDRED (O.S.)

DIXON
Well,... I know he isn’t your rapist.
He is a rapist, though. I’m sure of
that.
129B

INT. BILLBOARD ROAD - CONTINUOUS
MILDRED
What are you saying?
DIXON (O.S.)
I got his license plate. I know where
he lives.
MILDRED
Where’s he live?
DIXON (O.S.)
Lives in Idaho.
MILDRED
That’s funny. I’m driving to Idaho in
the morning.
DIXON (O.S.)
Want some company?

Sure.

MILDRED
(pause)

INT. DIXON’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

130

DIXON puts the phone back in its cradle. Looks at the gun in
his arms. Leaves it on his bed. He looks in on his sleeping
MOMMA.
131

EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAWN

131

The billboards as the sun begins to rise on the horizon.
131A

EXT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAWN

131A

Sunrise behind the empty swing-set.
132

INT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAWN

MILDRED looks in on ROBBIE, sleeping quietly, a drawing of
Angela he’s done pinned on the wall above his pillow.
133

EXT. MILDRED’S HOUSE - DAWN

133

MILDRED puts a thermos, sandwiches and Doritos in the car.
DIXON places a shotgun wrapped in a blanket inside too.
MILDRED looks at it lying there. They exchange a look, get in
the car and drive.
EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - CONTINUOUS
The burned backs of the billboards framed along the roadside,
as the car heads away towards the horizon.
134

INT. CAR DRIVING BILLBOARD ROAD - DAWN

134

As the car rolls along the road, they’re both quiet, nervous.
They drive in silence a while.
Hey Dixon?
Yeah?

MILDRED
DIXON

MILDRED
I need to tell you something.
(pause)
It was me who burned down the police
station.
DIXON
Well, who the Hell else would it have
been?

83.
She smiles. They drive on in silence.
Dixon?
Yep?

MILDRED
DIXON

MILDRED
You sure about this?
DIXON
About killing this guy?
(pause)
Not really. You?
MILDRED
(pause)
Not really.
They continue on.
MILDRED (CONT’D)
I guess we can decide along the way.
DIXON nods. She smiles. They drive on.
