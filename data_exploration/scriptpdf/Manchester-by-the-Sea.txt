EXT. BOSTON -- ROXBURY -- APARTMENT HOUSE. DAY.

*

1

It’s a cold winter day on a narrow street.
In front of a small apartment building, LEE CHANDLER the
custodian, sweeps away the old snow on the pavement, then
sprinkles salt in front of the building. He is 40, wearing
janitor’s coveralls under his weatherbeaten winter jacket.

INT. MRS GROOM’S APARTMENT. DAY.

*

Standing on a ladder in a small grandmotherly apartment, Lee
changes a light bulb in the very small bathroom. MRS GROOM,
70s, is on the phone outside the open bathroom door.
MRS GROOM
(On the phone)
No, it’s my sister Janine’s oldest
girl’s Bat Mitzvah...No, I look
forward to being bored to death...
No, the girl doesn’t want it, the
father doesn’t want it. I don’t
ask. Seven hours in the car, I
could really slit my throat...Oh,
well, the little girls are
charming.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY.

Lee works on a leaky toilet while MR MARTINEZ, 50s, a big man
in an undershirt and glasses, stands by watching.

2.
MR MARTINEZ
I don’t know why the hell it keeps
dripping. All night long, drip,
drip. I’ve had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.
LEE
You need a new stopper.
MR MARTINEZ
Oh is that it?
LEE
See how it’s rotted around the
edges? It doesn’t make a seal, so
the water drips into the bowl. I
can bring you a new one tomorrow,
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

MARTINEZ
What do you recommend?

*
*

Lee starts putting away his tools and cleaning up.

*

LEE
Well, I could replace the stopper
first, and if that doesn’t work,
then I would come back and replace
the whole apparatus.

*
*
*
*
*

MARTINEZ
But you don’t have a professional
recommendation?
LEE
It’s really up to you.
MARTINEZ
Well, tomorrow I got my sister-inlaw coming over with my nephews
...and I gotta take my car in...
Lee waits while Mr Martinez works out his schedule.

Lee looks down at a stopped-up toilet. Behind him is
MARIANNE, slender, 30s, attractive, wearing everyday aroundthe-house clothes.

3.
MARIANNE
I am so sorry. This is so gross.
LEE
It’s all right.
He plunges her toilet carefully and methodically.
LATER -- He wipes up the floor. Marianne comes in.
MARIANNE
Oh Lee, you don’t have to do that,
honestly.
That’s OK.

LEE

MARIANNE
Well -- God. Thank you so much, I
am so sorry.
LATER -- He is washing his hands in her bathroom sink.
IN HER SMALL LIVING ROOM -- He comes out of the bathroom.
Marianne is now dressed up to go out. She looks great.
All set.

LEE

MARIANNE
Thank you so much. Can I give you a
tip?
LEE
You mean, like a suggestion?

*
*

MARIANNE
(Taking out a ten)
No -- I mean -- like, a tip...

*
*
*

LEE
That’s all right. Have a good
night.
MARIANNE
Oh, please. I’d feel bad.
LEE
(Takes the money)
OK, thanks a lot. Good night.
MARIANNE
Good night! And thank you so much.

10

INT. MRS OLSEN’S BATHROOM. DAY.

10

Lee is down on his hand and knees. MRS OLSEN, 40s, in a
bathrobe, is very good-looking but bad-tempered and nervous.
She’s in a bathrobe.
MRS OLSEN
How many times do we have to fix
these fucking pipes? Every time I
take a shower their entire
apartment has a flood. It’s driving
me insane.
LEE
I’ll bring the plumber tomorrow but
I’d say we’re gonna have to break
through the tile and try to isolate
the leak, because there was quite a
lot of water -MRS OLSEN
But how do you know it’s me? Why is
it automatically me?
LEE
Because it if was coming from
higher up you’d have water damage
on the ceiling too, and maybe in
your wall, and it’s all dry.
Great.

MRS OLSEN

Lee looks at the bathtub.
LEE
It might just be the caulking. This
whole tub needs to be re-caulked.
Did you take a bath or shower in
the last couple of hours?
Yes...

MRS OLSEN

LEE
Well, it could actually just be
that.
MRS OLSEN
OK. And how are you planning to
find that out?
LEE
Well, we could turn on the shower
and see if it drip downstairs...
MRS OLSEN
You want me to take a shower now?

5.

No...

LEE

*

MRS OLSEN
You want me to take a shower while
you stand there watching, to see if
the water drips down into the
Friedrich’s apartment?

*
*

LEE
I don’t really give a fuck what you
do, Mrs. Olsen. I just want to find
the leak.
Mrs Olsen goes white with shock and fury.
MRS OLSEN
No, you can get out of my apartment
and don’t ever come back.
LEE

OK.

MRS OLSEN (CONT'D)
How dare you fucking talk to
me like that? Get the fuck
out of my house before I call
the police!

*

LEE
You’re blockin’ the doorway.
11

INT. MR EMERY’S OFFICE. NIGHT.

11

The building manager’s office. MR EMERY is in his 50s. Lee
sits in the chair before the crowded desk.
EMERY
What the fuck’s matter with you?
You can’t talk to the tenants like
that!

*
*

Lee shrugs.
EMERY (CONT’D)
Look, Lee. You do a good job.
You’re dependable. But I get these
complaints all the time. You’re
rude, you’re unfriendly, you don’t
say good mornin’. I mean come on!
LEE
Mr Emery, I fix the plumbing. I
take out the garbage. I paint their
apartments. I do electrical work -which we both know is against the
law. I show up on time, I’m workin’
four buildings and you get all the
money. So do whatever you’re gonna
do.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

6.
EMERY
Would you be willin’ to apologize
to Mrs Olsen?
For what?

*

LEE

EMERY
For callin’ her a cunt...!

*
*

LEE
That’s not what I called her.

*
*

EMERY
All right, all right, I’ll talk to
her.

*

Lee gets up to go.
12

INT. A LOUD ROXBURY BAR. NIGHT.

12

> Lee drinks alone at a small, crowded neighborhood bar.

*

> AT THE BAR -- Lee is waiting for service. Someone bumps a
CUTE GIRL, 30s, into him. She spills some beer on him.

*

GIRL
Oh my God, I’m sorry! Did I
get you? Yeah. Lemme get a
napkin. Lenny, could I get a
couple of napkins? (Gives Lee
some napkins.) Here you
are...
Thanks.

LEE
That’s OK. I’m OK...

LEE

GIRL
Well, now I spilled beer all over
you, my name’s Sharon.
That’s OK.

LEE

GIRL
And you are...
Lee.

LEE

She gets the message that he is not interested. He pats
himself dry, not looking at her.

7.
13

LATER --

13

The bar is far less packed. We see SHARON across the room,
talking to a girlfriend. At the bar, Lee is drinking alone.
He’s pretty drunk by now. He is looking at two BUSINESSMEN,
40s. One of them notices and mentions it to the other. They
look at him for a moment then ignore him. He gets up and
walks toward them. They are surprised at his approach.

*
*
*
*
*

1ST BUSINESSMAN
How you doin’?
2ND BUSINESSMAN
How you doin’?
LEE
Good. I’m good. Can I ask you guys,
have we met before?
The two men look at each other then back at Lee
1ST BUSINESSMAN
I don’t think so.

No...
No.

2ND BUSINESSMAN
I don’t think so either.

*
*

LEE
So you guys don’t know me?

*

1ST BUSINESSMAN

2ND BUSINESSMAN
No, Yeah. No. Do we?

*

LEE (CONT’D)
Well then what the fuck are you
lookin’ at me for?
Excuse me?

2ND BUSINESSMAN

LEE
I said why the fuck are you lookin’
at me?
1ST BUSINESSMAN
Sir, we really weren’t
looking at you -BARTENDER
(Hurrying over)
Hey, Lee...Lee...!

2ND BUSINESSMAN
Hey! Take a fuckin’ walk. Hey
-- Paul -- No -- don’t
apologize to this asshole-(To LEE) Take a hike!

Lee HITS the 2nd Businessman and knocks him into a wall.
Several pictures fall and smash on the floor.

*

8.
BARTENDER
Oh, Goddamn it -Lee punches the 1ST BUSINESSMAN’s nose. He falls back and
grabs his face, blood streaming from both nostrils. The 2nd
Businessmen and Lee swipe at each other.
1ST BUSINESSMAN
You broke my fuckin’ nose!

2ND BUSINESSMAN
Goddamn lunatic --

The BARTENDER leaps over the bar and grabs Lee from behind -Other guys join in to break it up.
BARTENDER
Lee! Lee! Lee! Enough!

VARIOUS VOICES
Break it up! Break it up!

LEE
Lemme go. I gotta go take a hike.
General melee.
14

INT. LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT.

14

Lee turns the light on and comes in. He is a little roughed
up from the fight.
At his dresser, Lee pulls on sweatpants and an undershirt.
There are THREE FRAMED PHOTOS in imitation silver frames
standing on the little dresser. We don’t see the photos.
Lee sits on the sofa with a beer and turns the TV on to a
late-night Sports program. Slowly he falls asleep. The can in
his hand tips slowly sideways and spills onto the sofa.
15

EXT. LEE’S STREET. DAY.

15

It’s snowing. Lots of slow, heavy flakes, very pretty.
16

EXT. LEE’S BUILDING - WINTER. DAY.

16

Lee is shoveling snow. The air is clear and cold. The whole
street is beautified by the recent snow storm. His iPhone
rings. He takes off his gloves. Digs out the phone.
LEE
Hello ... This is Lee ... Oh ...
When did that happen? ... Well, how
is he? ... OK. Uh...No. Don’t do
that. I’ll come up right now ...
OK. Thank you.
He hangs up and goes inside with the shovel, leaving the snow
before the building only partially cleared and salted down.

*

9.
17

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.

17

Lee sits behind the wheel, trying to get out of Boston and
onto Rt 1. North. He’s talking on his iPhone.
LEE
(Into his iPhone)
Mr Emery, it’s Lee again. I
contacted Jose, who says he can
cover for me til Friday night at
least, and then Gene MacAdavey can
take over till I get back. I’ll be
in Manchester at least a week or
two. I’ll call again when I have
more information. Goodbye.

*
*
*

He hangs up and drives into increasingly heavy traffic.

*

LEE (CONT’D)
Come on, come on.

*

The traffic slows. He becomes increasingly anxious.

*
18

Lee’s car takes the exit for North Salem.
19

EXT. NORTH SALEM HOSPITAL. DAY.

knows exactly where he’s going. He parks and gets out. He
walks quickly to the main entrance, then breaks into a run.
20

INT. NORTH SALEM HOSPITAL. DAY.

20

We lead/follow Lee as he walks quickly through the halls
toward the ICU, navigating the twists and turns from habit.
He goes into the ICU -21

INT. ICU -- NURSE’S STATION -- CONTINUOUS. DAY.

21

-- and approaches GEORGE, around 50, a big weatherbeaten guy,
and NURSE IRENE, 40s. They both react as Lee approaches.
Hiya, Lee.

*

GEORGE

LEE
Is he dead?
George’s eyes fill with tears. He makes a helpless gesture.

*

10.
NURSE IRENE
I’m sorry, Lee. He passed away
about an hour ago.
Oh.

LEE

NURSE IRENE
I’m so sorry.
Lee looks at the floor, hands on his hips. Nurse Irene gives
his arm an awkward squeeze. Lee stares into the middle
distance for a moment.
LEE
Did you see him?

*
*

GEORGE
Yeah. I mean -- No --

*
*

NURSE IRENE
George br --

GEORGE (CONT'D)
I brought him in.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
...We were lookin’ at the boat this
mornin’, and he just -- I don’t
know, he just, like, fell over. I
thought he was kiddin’ me at first.
Then I called the ambulance...and
uh -- that was it.
Lee shakes his head, still staring at the floor.
NURSE IRENE
I’ll just call Dr Muller and tell
him that you’re here.
LEE
Where’s Dr Betheny?
NURSE IRENE
Oh, she’s on maternity leave. Oh
here he is.
DR MULLER, 40s, has just joined them.
DR MULLER
Lee? I’m Dr Muller. We spoke on the
phone.
Yeah. Hi.

LEE

DR MULLER
I’m very, very sorry.
Thank you.

LEE

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

11.
DR MULLER
Hello, George.
He shake hands with George.
Hiya Jim.

GEORGE

DR MULLER
How you holding up?
GEORGE
Oh -- Great! You know.
DR MULLER
Well...it’s a very sad day.
Yeah.

GEORGE

George starts to cry. He looks down and wipes his eyes.
LEE
Where’s my brother?
DR MULLER
He’s downstairs. You can see him if
you want.
LEE
What happened?

*

DR MULLER
Well, you know his heart was very
weak at this point, and it just
gave out. If it’s any comfort, I
don’t think he suffered very much.
I’m sorry you didn’t get here in
time, but as I told you on the
phone --

*
*
*
*
*

LEE
Aw, fuck this. (He looks at the
floor. Long Pause. He looks up.)
Sorry.
DR MULLER
That’s perfectly all right.

GEORGE
That’s OK, buddy.

LEE (CONT’D)
Did anybody call my Uncle?
DR MULLER and GEORGE glance at each other.
GEORGE
Their Uncle Donny.

*
*

12.
LEE
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle.
Somebody shoulda called them.
What?

GEORGE (CONT'D)
No, Lee -- Lee, no --

GEORGE (CONT’D)
-- Donny got a job in Minnesota,
like -Minnesota?

LEE

No.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
-- awhile ago. Yeah: He got a
job with some outfit in
Minnetonka, Minnesota, if you
can believe that. Joe didn't
tell you about that?
LEE

*
*

GEORGE
I can call ‘em if you want, Lee.
And tell ‘em what happened.
LEE
OK. Thanks...
LEE (CONT’D)
Tell ‘em...Tell ‘em what
happened. Tell ‘em I’ll call
‘em tonight, probably
tomorrow. Talk about
arrangements.

GEORGE
Oh, no problem -*

GEORGE
Sure, I can do that.
LEE
And somebody better call my wife.
There is a confused, embarrassed hesitation.
Your...

DR MULLER

LEE
Ex-wife. Yes. Sorry.
I meant Randi.

GEORGE
You mean Randi?
That's OK -- I already
thought of that. I'll take
care of it.

*

LEE
OK, thanks.

*
*

GEORGE
No problem.

*
*

13.
LEE
Can I see him now?
Sure.

DR MULLER

GEORGE
Lee -- I can wait up here, Lee, in
case you need anything.
OK.

*
*
*

LEE

*
*

Dr Muller leads Lee away. George breaks down again.
GEORGE

*
*

NURSE IRENE
Would you like a Kleenex?

*
*

GEORGE
Thanks. Yeah.

*
*

I'm sorry.

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR.

Dr Muller and Lee ride down very slowly.
LEE
How is Dr Betheny?
DR MULLER
Oh, she's doing very well. She just
had twin girls.
LEE
Oh yeah. Irene told me.
DR MULLER
Apparently weigh about eleven
pounds apiece. So she's gonna have
her hands full for a while...I’ll
call her this afternoon and tell

DR MULLER
Yes she was.

23

INT. JOE CHANDLER’S HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.

23

JOE CHANDLER, Lee’s older brother by five years, is lying in
the hospital bed. There’s a close resemblance between them.
ELISE, Joe’s wife, the same age as Joe, pretty, anxious and
high-strung -- stands near to STANLEY CHANDLER -- Lee and
Joe’s father, 70s. He sits in one chair. LEE sits in another.
They are all listening to DR BETHENY, 30s. She is small,
intense, very serious and focused and level-headed, but
thoroughly well-meaning and decent. The bed area is curtained
off from the other patients in the room.
DR BETHENY
The disease is commonly referred to
as congestive heart failure -Oh my God!

ELISE

DR BETHENY
Are you familiar with it?
No...!

ELISE

JOE
Then what are you sayin’ “Oh my
God” for?
ELISE
Because what is it?
JOE
She’s tryin’ to explain it to us,
honey. I’m sorry, Dr Beth...uh...
Betheny:

DR BETHENY

JOE
I’m sorry. I can never get it
right.

DR BETHENY (CONT'D)
Don’t worry about it. Not a
problem.

STAN
So, you were saying, Dr Beth.
JOE
It’s Dr Betheny, Dad.

LEE
Dr Betheny, Daddy, Try to get
it right..

ELISE
It’s a comedy routine!
JOE
Would you let her tell it?

STAN
Elise, please...

*
*

15.
ELISE (CONT’D)
Oh my God: When am I gonna put one
foot right?

*

JOE
Honey, for Christ’s sakes!
ELISE
How about a hint?

*
*

Stanley takes Elise’s hand and holds onto it.
STAN
Elise...Sweetheart...Let’s just let
her explain the situation to us...
Daddy...

LEE

STAN
What? She's fine. We're all upset.
We're all gonna listen, then we're
gonna ask everything we wanna ask,
and then we’re gonna figure out
what do to, together. Right?
Right.

JOE

INT. WAITING ROOM. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUS

24

PATRICK CHANDLER, 7, is watching TV, with an 18 YEAR-OLD
BABYSITTER. Two WOMEN VISITORS are chatting as he watches.
DR BETHENY (V.O.)
It's a gradual deterioration of the
muscles of the heart. It’s usually
associated with older people, but
in rarer cases it will occur in a
younger person...
25

INT. HOSPITAL - JOE’S ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
DR BETHENY
...Some people can live as long as
fifty or sixty years with just an
occasional attack. But most people
suffer periodic episodes, like the
one you had on Monday, which mimic
the symptoms of a heart attack and
which further weaken the muscle.
They can put you out of commission
for a week, two weeks.
(MORE)

*
*
*
25

16.
DR BETHENY (CONT'D)
And you’ll need to be hospitalized
so we can monitor your heart,
because the risk of cardiac arrest
is elevated for a week or two.
Oh my God.

ELISE

STAN
(Pats her hand)
OK...OK...

*

DR BETHENY
But in between these episodes, most
people feel perfectly healthy and
you can basically live a normal
life.

*
*
*
*
*

JOE
So...What do you mean that some
people live as long as fifty or
sixty years? You mean total? Or
from when they're diagnosed with
this, or what?

*

Total.

DR BETHENY

Everyone is stunned into silence, even Elise.
DR BETHENY (CONT’D)
For approximately eighty percent of
patients your age the most common
statistical life expectancy is five
years or less.

*

Elise grips Stan’s hand. Lee looks at the floor.
Wow.

JOE

DR BETHENY
But the statistics vary widely, and
they’re just statistics. You’re not
a statistic, you’re just one
person, and we don't know what’s
going to happen to you yet. But
it’s not a good disease.

*
*
*
*

JOE
What’s a good disease?
DR BETHENY
Poison Ivy.

*
*

17.
ELISE
(Rising)
I do not see where the humor lies
in this situation.
STAN
Elise, you must calm down.
JOE
Honey, please...

DR BETHENY
I’m sorry. I’m really not
trying to --

LEE
(To Dr Betheny)
Don’t -- it’s fine.
Elise pulls her hand away from Stan and waves “No” at them.
ELISE
No. No more -- I’m not gonna -STAN
Elise, let’s get you a glass
of water --

ELISE (CONT'D)
No m -- No.

LEE
Daddy. Forget it.
JOE (TO LEE)
Hey, shut up.

*

ELISE
Yeah, forget it. Forget it like you
-- No, you know what? I’m tired of
bein’ the bad guy here.

*
*
*
*

JOE
Jesus Christ! Who’s in the
fuckin’ hospital?!

Nobody th --

STAN

ELISE (CONT’D)
Right! So I’ll be the bad guy, and
you be in the hospital and explain
the jokes to your son. I’m goin’
home.
JOE
You’re goin’ home.

STAN
Sweetheart --

SHE WALKS OUT fast, her heels clicking against the floor.
STAN
Lemme get her back.
Fuck her.

LEE

JOE
You wanna stop with that
shit?

STAN
Come on with that stuff
already!

The Baby-Sitter and 7-Year Old Patrick see Elise coming down
the hall. The Baby-Sitter comes to the waiting room door.
BABYSITTER

DR MULLER
Thank you, Tony.
Lee goes in and looks down at the body. Pause.

OK.

LEE
(Hesitates)

DR MULLER
Take your time.
Lee moves closer to the body. He touches Joe’s hand. It feels
dead so he touches his shoulder where there’s a sleeve.
SEVEN YEARS AGO -29

EXT. THE SEA - JOE’S BOAT. DAY.

29

Autumn. LEE, JOE and 8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK are on JOE’S BOAT.
The Cape Ann coast is in the distance. The boat is rigged for
whale-watching and deep sea fishing charters. Lee discreetly
keeps a hand near the rod as 8 Year-Old Patrick trolls. Joe
is at the tiller. He's looking thinner but better.
Like that?

8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK

19.
LEE
Yeah, only keep your thumb off the
line, ‘cause if you get a strike
it's gonna slice it right open. And
you know what happens then.
What?

*
*

8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK

LEE
The sharks are gonna smell that
blood and rip this boat apart.

*
*

8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK
No they won’t. Dad, will they?
JOE
Oh yeah. I seen a school of sharks
tear a boat to pieces like it was
made of cardboard, just ‘cause some
kid threw a band-aid in the water.

*

8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK
No you didn’t.
LEE
Sometimes the only way to keep ‘em
off is to throw the kid directly in
the ocean to distract ‘em.
8 YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Shut up. Sharks don’t even swim in
schools.
JOE
Is this kid smart or what?
LEE
Yep. And a really smart kid is
exactly the kind of quality meal a
humongous school of sharks is
lookin’ for when they’re circlin’ a
boat.
PATRICK
Uncle Lee! Shut up!
Patrick's REEL starts SPINNING OUT with a thrilling whine.
LEE
Strike! Strike!
Ease up on the drag -And watch that fuckin’ thumb!

JOE
Look out, look out!
You got a strike!
Ease up, ease up!

PATRICK (CONT’D)
(Hits him)
No swearing!

*
*

20.
Patrick loses his balance. Lee catches him and props him up.
LEE
Don't hit me -- ! Catch the
fish! We're doin’ fine. (To
Joe) Just drive the boat.
Patty, pull up sharp! Come
on, buddy! There you go! (To
JOE) Mind your business!

JOE
What are you guys doin’? Hook
the fish! Get the hook in him
before he -- ! I’m drivin’
the Goddamn boat. Get that
hook in him!

Lee helps Patrick pull the rod back sharply a few times.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
What kind of fish is it?
JOE
Gotta be a Great White, Patty
-- Maybe a Baracudda -Shut up!

LEE
Feels like a Great White
Shark to me.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Patrick is ecstatic with nerves and excitement.
THE PRESENT -30

INT. MORGUE. DAY

Lee looks at Joe’s body. He leans over and kisses his cheek.

DR MULLER
No -- you had asked us to wait for
you to get here -LEE
(On “us”)
Yes -- Thank you. So...What is the
procedure now?
DR MULLER
Well -- You should make

everything.

Evening of the same day as the fishing scene. Lee comes into
his small house and takes off his wet things. In the living
room, his daughter SUZY, 7, is watching TV. A fire is
crackling behind a firescreen. A radio is playing O.S.

*

Hello?

RANDI (O.S.)

LEE
Hi honey! (To the girl) Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home. (Pause) Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home.
Hi Daddy.

SUZY

LEE
Hi, sweetheart.

He bends down to kiss her. She hooks her arm around his neck
and pulls him off balance, her eyes locked on the TV screen.
Hug.

RANDI, Lee’s wife, 30s, is in bed with a cold. She is tough,
loving and sarcastic. The room is littered with Kleenex and
cold remedies and clothes. KAREN, 5, is playing with colored
plastic blocks on the floor. There is a CRIB in a corner.
Hi honey.

LEE

RANDI
You have a good time?
LEE
Yeah, really good. Where’s your
mother?
RANDI
They just left.
Oh no.

LEE

*

RANDI
Yeah, she really missed you.

LEE
There’s always next time. Did you
sleep?

RANDI
Oh, yeah. It’s always restful when
my mother’s here.

LEE
That’s too bad. Hi Kary.
Hi Daddy.

KAREN

LEE
(Picking her up)
Hello sweetheart.
KAREN
Put me down.
LEE
I’m puttin’ you down. Relax.
He kisses her and starts to put her down. She wriggles and
jerks unexpectedly backward. Lee almost loses his grip.
LEE (CONT’D)
Hey, hey, hey!

Karen...!

RANDI

*

LEE (CONT’D)
(Puttng her down)
Honey, don’t jerk around like that,
I almost dropped you on your head.
KAREN
I’m making a hair salon.

*

LEE
Oh yeah? It’s really good. You
wanna cut my hair?

*
*

KAREN
It’s just for girls. I’m sorry.
LEE
I understand. (To Randi) How you
feelin’?
RANDI
Little better.
LEE
You sound better.
RANDI
Did you actually use the fishin’
tackle?

*
*

LEE
Yeah, we really did. Patrick got a
humongous bluefish. 18 pounds.

*

RANDI
Oh yeah? That’s awesome!
LEE
I never seen anybody so happy in my
life.
He crosses to her through the tissue-strewn, cluttered room.

*
*

25.
LEE (CONT’D)
It’s nice in here. You keep it
nice. What a homemaker.
Fuck off.

RANDI

He tries to kiss her. She turns her head.
RANDI (CONT’D)
Get away from me.
They kiss. She claps his hand onto her breast.
RANDI (CONT'D)
No, don't, stop, I'm sick.

*

They kiss some more. She shoves him away.
RANDI (CONT'D)
OK, get offa me.
Lee goes to the CRIB. Inside is STANLEY, 8 months old, awake
and placid, waving his limbs at a multicolored mobile.
LEE
Hi Stanny. How come you’re not
cryin’?
RANDI
Let him alone. He’s been quiet for
half an hour.
Lee picks the baby up.
LEE
Half an hour. What is that
about? Take it easy. (To the
baby) Hiya buddy. You are
very handsome.

RANDI (CONT'D)
Oh Lee, please don't pick him
up!
If he’s not makin’ any noise,
Leave Well Enough Alone.

LEE
“Leave well enough alone.” That’s
what me and Mummy shoulda done
instead of gettin’ married.
RANDI
(Opens her magazine)
Just shut up.
LEE
...but then you wouldn’t be here.
And neither would your sisters. And
I could watch the football game in
my own livin’ room. That’s right, I
could.

*

26.
RANDI
Go fuck yourself.
Lee kisses the baby and puts him back in the crib.
LEE
See? I didn’t make him cry. ‘Cause
I know how to handle him.
RANDI
How was Joe?
LEE
He’s all right. You know? He’s
doin’ all right.
RANDI
And you didn’t run outta beer? You
got through the day OK?

*
*

LEE
Oh yeah. We were very temperate.

*

RANDI
I don’t know why you guys bother
gettin’ on the friggin’ boat.
LEE
Because we love the sea.

*

LEE (CONT’D)
I only had eight beers over a seven
hour period. That’s approximately
one point four two somethin’ beers
per hour.

*
*
*
*

RANDI
No, it’s almost like a normal
person stayin’ sober.
LEE
I told you I was cuttin’ down.
Lee starts to get undressed.
RANDI
What do you think you’re gonna do?
LEE
I guess I’m gonna take a shower.
Randi, I swear to God. You shoulda
seen the look on Patty’s face when
he caught that fish. It was like
takin’ Suzy on the Merry Go Round.
It was like -- pure happiness.
She smiles at him. Lee crawls across the bed.

27.
RANDI
Get away. I’m sick. I’m deeply
sick.
They kiss. Karen plays on the floor. The baby waves his arms.

The Rockport/Manchester team is having practice. PATRICK is
on the ice. He is just 16, skinny, athletic, long-haired. He
is bright, practical, pugnacious.

*

29.
The HOCKEY COACH, 40’s, is shouting instructions. PATRICK
checks another KID against the boards. They start fighting.
They’re evenly matched but Patrick is kind of wild. The COACH
yanks Patrick off the other kid.

*

HOCKEY COACH
OK, break it up! Break it up! You!
Chandler! One more time and you are
OUT. Understand me?
Patrick sees LEE in the stands, over the coach’s shoulder..
PATRICK
Aw, fuck me.
HOCKEY COACH
What’s that, Chandler?
PATRICK
Aw, fuck my fuckin’ ass.
HOCKEY COACH
OK, you are out! You’re benched!
PATRICK
(To himself, skating away)
Ask me if I give a shit.
HOCKEY COACH
What’s that? What’s the matter?
Patrick skates over to Lee. The Coach sees Lee and hesitates.
A small scrappy kid named JOEL skates up, followed by C.J., a
big handsome athletic kid. These are Patrick’s friends.
JOEL
That’s his Uncle.
CJ
His Dad must be in the hospital.
HOCKEY COACH
Whose Dad? Chandler’s?
CJ
He’s got congestive heart
failure. Patrick’s Dad, I
mean. Not Patrick.

JOEL
...He only comes up when Mr
Chandler’s in the hospital.

Some other kids skate up and are watching Patrick and LEE.
HOCKEY COACH (CONT’D)
That’s Lee Chandler? The Lee
Chandler?
CJ
Yeah, but you know that stuff about
him’s bullshit, Mr Howard.

*

30.
JOEL
Yeah, that story’s bullshit.

HOCKEY COACH
You guys wanna watch the language?
Sorry.

JOEL

Sorry.

CJ

Across the rink, Lee is talking to Patrick. Patrick is
kicking up little shards of ice with his skate. The COACH
notices that all the kids have stopped to watch.
HOCKEY COACH (CONT’D)
OK, Everybody wanna mind their own
business? Five minute break. That
means five!
The kids break up, marginally. The Coach skates over to Lee
and Patrick. They talk briefly. The Coach puts a well-meant
but sentimental hand on Patrick’s shoulder. Lee goes back up
the aisle.
CJ and JOEL skate over to PATRICK. He tells them. They react
sincerely and with sympathy. They squeeze his shoulder, they
each hug him. All the kids are watching again by now.
HOCKEY COACH (CONT’D)
OK, show’s over! Crossovers! At the
blue line. Let’s go, let’s go! Line
up!
The kids start skating around, lining up at the blue line.
Patrick breaks away and skates toward the exit by himself.

The winter sun is getting low. Patrick sports a semi-grunge
garage-band look. Longish greasy hair, Army jacket, black Tshirt with some design on it, cargo pants maybe.
Oh well.

PATRICK

They pass a sign for MANCHESTER, BEVERLY and NORTH SALEM.
LEE
I gotta go back to the hospital and
sign some papers. Do you wanna see
him?
PATRICK
Him who? See who?
LEE
Your Dad. Do you wanna look at him?

*

31.
PATRICK
I don’t know. What does he look
like?

*

LEE
He looks like he's dead. (Pause) I
mean, he doesn't look like he's
asleep, or anything like that. He
doesn't look gross...(Pause) You
don't have to. I wanted to see him.
Maybe you don't want that image in

PATRICK
Let's just go.
At the same instant Patrick opens his door to step out and
Lee starts DRIVING. He slams on the brakes.

LEE
What the fuck are you doing?
PATRICK
I just said let’s go inside!
LEE
No, you just said “Let’s just go!”
LEE (CONT’D)
And then you get out of the

What the fuck’s the matter

I coulda ripped your fuckin’

Yeah, I meant let’s go

over-relaxed and too touchy-feely with Patrick.
SILVIE
At least he didn’t suffer. It’s
worse for the family, but it’s
better for the person.
CJ
Well, he was a fuckin’ great guy,
Patrick, I’ll tell you that.
JOEL
That’s for sure.
CJ

preservers? And I was like,
“What’s the difference, Mr
Chandler? Boat sinks in this

And he says “The lifejacket’s
to make it easier on the
sharks when you go over.”

The boys laugh.
PATRICK
Yeah, he really liked those shark
jokes.
JOEL

No its not! Ask Patrick! Ask

Then what are you asking me for?
PATRICK
No reason. Thanks.(Pause) So -- Not
that it would come up, but her
parents think she stays downstairs
when she stays over? So if it comes
up for some reason, can you just
say she stayed in the downstairs
room?
LEE
I don’t even know them.
PATRICK
Yes you do. It’s the McGanns. Frank

Yeah. So do you mind sayin’ she

They are muddy and dusty from playing softball. They drop the
softball gear, start taking off their muddy sneakers, etc.
JOE

Goddamn ball?
9 YEAR-OLD PATRICK
I’m not sulking.
JOE (To Lee)
Shut up! (To Patrick) If you

mitt you wouldn’t drop the
fuckin’ ball.
Shaddup, shaddUP, you stupid
dogs! ELISE!

LEE (To JOE)
Why don’t you stop already?
You wanna stop?
Why don’t you kill him?
I think you should kill him.

I don't need a baseball mitt.

9-YEAR OLD PATRICK
Dad! No cursing!
ELISE is PASSED OUT on the SOFA, her short nightie scrunched
up underneath her. She's got no underwear on, so the men and
9 Year-Old Patrick can see everything. There's a half-empty
bottle and a glass of liquor on the coffee table. Cigarette
butts spill over the ashtray. Joe takes immediate control.
JOE
Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs

SILVIE comes through the kitchen door, dressed, very
comfortable in the house.
Morning.
Hello.

SILVIE
LEE

Over the following she gets some juice and yogurt out of the
fridge, some herbal tea, and puts on the kettle, while Lee
watches her. Patrick enters, gets some cold cereal.

phone.

PATRICK
Pass the milk please.
LEE
So but, I don't know what I gotta
do to get his body from the
hospital to your place, but they
said ... Oh, OK...

41.
SILVIE
Excuse me, Mr Chandler? I don’t
think Patrick needs to be here for
this.
PATRICK
That’s all right.
Lee gets up and goes out. Silvie puts a hand on Patrick’s
hand. We can hear LEE’S VOICE from the other room.
LEE (O.S.)
So why is it more to drive his body
to Manchester? ‘Cause you gotta
take the highway for seven minutes?
What do you charge if the hearse
takes 127?
SILVIE
Jesus. Like that’s his focus?
PATRICK
He’s alright.
67

EXT. MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALL. DAY.

Lee’s car stops in front of the school gate. Patrick and

Thanks a lot, Mr Chandler.

He watches them walk toward the school, joining a general
swarm of kids funneling to the school entrance.
68

INT. SCHOOL. DAY.

Patrick walks thru the halls. Various kids greet him with
expressions of sympathy.

Hey, Patrick. Sorry to hear about

HOCKEY COACH
We’re gonna forget about the

the fists. But I want you take a
few days offa practice. I don’t
want you on the ice. You got enough
on your mind.
PATRICK
That’s OK, Mr Howard. To tell you
the truth, I could use the
distraction -HOCKEY COACH
The ice is not a distraction. When
you’re on the ice, you gotta be
there. Take the week and we’ll
talk. And listen: I lost my Dad
right about your age. So I know
what you’re goin’ through. So if
you wanna come in and talk, or you
just want somebody to spill your
guts to -- or you just wanna throw
the bull around, door’s open.

LEE
They all sound the same to me.
PATRICK
Where we going?
LEE
To see the lawyer.

LEE
We gotta read your father’s will.

Well, yeah -- except we’re there.
They are approaching the Manchester’s tiny business district.

They walk toward the little two story office building.
PATRICK
Who do you think he left the boat
to?
LEE
I’m sure he left you everything.
As they go up the OUTDOOR STAIRWAY to the 2nd story office,
We hear the SOUND of a PING PONG game: Ka-POP, ka-POP, plus
other growing sounds of voices and music. They take us to -FIVE YEARS AGO -73

INT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE - BASEMENT DEN. NIGHT.

73

LEE is playing PING-PONG with TOM DOHERTY -- the CAR DAD. A
bunch of his friends are drinking and making noise. Loud
music. We spot JOE and GEORGE. Lee SLAMS the BALL.
LEE
Eat my fuckin’ forehand, Tommy!
TOM
Once! That was once! He punts
the ball sixteen times and
now he’s Superman.

LEE (CONT'D)
I got it workin’ now. Just
keep away this quadrant and
you won’t go home in tears.

RANDI appears at the top of the basement stairs in a
bathrobe. Everybody looks up at her, like little boys.
RANDI
Would you keep it down, you fuckin’
morons? My kids are sleepin’.

44.
LEE
I’m sorry, honey. (To the guys) I
told you guys to keep it down.
RANDI
Lee, you wanna get these
fuckin’ pinheads outta my
house please?

THE GUYS
Yeah, Sorry, Ran/ I told you
guys to keep it down.

Randi leaves.
LEE (CONT’D)
She can’t talk that way to us.
TOM
Yeah. We’re not pinheads.
EVERYBODY LAUGHS. Randi immediately appears again, furious.
RANDI
Hey! I’m not fuckin’ around! It’s
two o’clock in the fuckin’ mornin’!
Get these fuckin’ assholes dressed
and get ‘em the fuck outta here.
THE PRESENT -74

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM. DAY.

74

Patrick sits, texting. An ASSISTANT types at her computer.
75

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUSLY.

75

WES, 40s, sits behind his desk across from LEE. Each holds a
copy of Joe’s Will.
LEE
I don’t understand.
WES
What -- part are you having trouble
with...?
LEE (On “trouble”)
I can’t be Patrick’s guardian.
WES
I understand it’s a serious
responsibility -LEE
No -- I mean -- I mean, I can’t -WES
Well -- Naturally I assumed that
Joe had discussed this with you --

45.
LEE
No. He didn’t. No.
WES
Well...I must say I’m somewhat
taken aback -LEE
He can’t live with me:
LEE (CONT’D)
I live in one room.

WES
But if you look -- Now, well,
if you look, you’ll see Joe
provided for Patrick’s
upkeep: Clothes, food, et
cetera...The house and boat
are owned outright...

LEE (CONT’D)
I don’t see how I could be his
guardian.
WES
Well, those were your brother’s
wishes.
LEE
Yeah but I can’t commute from
Boston every day until he turns
eighteen.
WES
I think the idea was that you would
relocate.
LEE
Relocate? Where? Here?

WES (CONT'D)
If you look at --

WES (CONT’D)
Well, yes. As you can see, your
brother worked everything out
extremely carefully.
LEE
But -- He can’t have meant
that.

WES (CONT'D)
And if you -- Well, you can
see see he’s allowed up to
five thousand dollars to help
you with the move. There's a
small amount set aside for
you to draw from, as personal
income while you settle in -assuming of course that you
accept...

LEE
What about Uncle Donny and Teresa?

46.
WES
Well, they did come up. But Joe
didn’t feel that Patrick really had
any special relationship or feeling
about them -LEE
I don't understand.
Minnesota.
Minnetonka, Minnesota.

WES (CONT'D)
And now, I think you know
they've moved out to
Wisconsin, I believe..
Minnesota, that's right.
So...

Wes watches as Lee flips through the 3-page Will as if
there's something he may have missed. After a moment:
WES (CONT'D)
It was my impression you’ve spent a
lot of time here over the years...
LEE
Just as backup. I came up to stay
with Patty whenever Joe was in the
hospital, after my Dad couldn’t do
it. We -- It was supposed to be my
Uncle Donny. I was just the backup.
WES
Well...I can only repeat, I’m
astonished that Joe never ran all
this by you, thorough as he was.
LEE
Yeah, because he knew what I would
say if he would have asked.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D)-76

INT. LEE’S HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS.

76

Lee shuts the front door, shivering in his shirt sleeves. The
house is empty. Outside we hear CARS DRIVING AWAY and some
rowdy shouting, which dies out as he comes in.
Randi is wrapped in a bathrobe, her arms folded. Lee shuts
the door and tries to kiss her. She turns her head.
LEE
I’ll clean up in the morning, baby.
RANDI
Yeah, right.
She lets him kiss her, then she goes off toward their
bedroom. Lee shivers and rubs his arms.

EXT. MINI-MART. NIGHT.

THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the clerk bag two 6-packs, milk,
and some Pampers for LEE. Lee comes out of the store. He has
some drunken trouble zipping his parka as he heads home. He
doesn’t notice the orange-red GLOW in the sky ahead.
THE PRESENT -82

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
WES
Lee...Nobody can appreciate what
you’ve been through...If I can say
that. And if you really don’t feel
you can take this on, that’s your
right, obviously -LEE
But who would get him?

48.
WES
The probate court would appoint a
guardian in your place.
Like who?

LEE

LEE (CONT’D)
My Uncle Donny?

WES
I don’t know -- No -- Not
necessarily. Especially, now
with the distance.

LEE (CONT’D)
Who else would there be?
WES
Well...I don’t know what’s
happening with Patrick’s mother -No. No.

LEE

WES (CONT'D)
I’m not sure where she is, or
what her condition is -- But
you can bet the judge would
certainly look into it.

EXT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

*

85

The little HOUSE is COMPLETELY ON FIRE. Fire trucks and
FIREMEN are pumping water into the blinding SMOKE. There is
also an ambulance and police cars. TWO POLICEMEN are trying
to control RANDI. She’s in a nightgown smeared with smoke and
water. She thrashes violently to shake them off so she can
run into the flaming house. She is completely hysterical.

49.
RANDI
Let me go! Get your hands off me!
Let go of me! Somebody go in there!
Let me go! Get them outta there!
We PAN the faces of a clutch of neighbors looking on,
mortified, until we land on LEE staring at the blazing house.
He still holds the paper bag from the mini-mart.
DISSOLVE TO:
86

EXT. LEE’S HOUSE. DAWN.

86

The sky is getting light. The fire is out. The smoking house
is burnt to nothing. The neighbors have been pushed back by
the police and firemen. Two EMS workers are putting Randi
into the ambulance. She's on a stretcher and wears an oxygen
mask. She is half conscious.
TWO POLICEMEN are questioning LEE. He’s still holding the
grocery bag. JOE is standing next to him now hastily stuffed
into his winter coat. He grips Lee’s arm with a gloved hand.
The ambulance with Randi in it drives away. LEE looks past
the policemen as EMS WORKERS approach the next ambulance.
They are bringing and loading THREE COVERED STRETCHERS
bearing THREE LITTLE BODIES into the ambulance as Lee
watches. In the last stretcher the smoke-blackened ELBOW of a
LITTLE GIRL sticks out a little from under the blanket. An
EMS Worker quickly pushes it under again.
They put the stretchers in the ambulance and shut the doors.
Without moving Lee starts crying hopelessly. The two cops
stop trying to talk to him. Joe holds Lee’s arm throughout.

SLOW PUSH IN ON LEE at a table, facing a POLICE DETECTIVE, a
UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, and the STATE FIRE MARSHALL.

*

LEE
You know. We were partyin’ pretty
hard. Beer, and somebody was
passin’ around a joint. Somebody
else had some cocaine.

LEE

FIRE MARSHALL

LEE
Anyway, our bedroom’s in the
downstairs. The girls sleep
upstairs. So Randi makes everybody
leave around two o’clock, maybe
three AM, and she went back to bed.
So everybody leaves, and I go
inside. And it’s really cold
inside, so I go check on the girls
and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there.
We sleep downstairs. The girls
sleep in the upstairs. But Randi
doesn’t like the central heat
because it dries her out her
sinuses, and she gets these
headaches. So I went downstairs and
built a fire in the fireplace, and
I sit down to watch TV, except
there’s no more beer. And I’m still
jumpin’ like a jackrabbit. So I put
a couple big logs on the fire so
the house would warm up when I was
gone, and I went to the minimart...It’s about a fifteen minute
walk both ways. But I didn’t wanna
drive cause I was really wasted.
And I’m halfway there, and I
remember I didn’t put the screen
back on the fireplace. But I figure
it’s probably OK.

to the store. And that’s it. One of
the logs musta rolled out on the
floor when I was gone. The girls
were all upstairs...And that’s it.
The firemen got Randi out. She was
passed out downstairs. And then
they said the furnace blew, and
they couldn’t go inside again. And
that’s all I remember.

Lee comes out of a room opposite, followed by the Detective

he GRABS a YOUNG COP from behind, pulls the GUN out of his
holster and shoves him away. SHOUTS and GUNS come out

trigger, but the SAFETY CATCH is ON. JOE is across the room

of the boat yard from Joe to
me -- No, you can’t maintain
it by yourself --

PATRICK

PATRICK (CONT’D)
It’s my boat now, isn’t it?

What does “trustee” mean?

Does that mean you’re allowed
to sell it if I don’t want
you to?

LEE
Because you’re a minor. You
can’t take it out alone. Yeah
-- But I’m the trustee. I
gotta make the payments, keep
up with the inspections -It means I’m in charge of
handling everything for you
until you turn eighteen -I don’t know. But I’d
definitely consider it --

PATRICK (CONT’D)
No fuckin’ way!
LEE
Don’t be so Goddamn sure of
yourself! There’s nobody to run it!
You’re sixteen years old!

LEE

George is taken aback, embarrassed.
PATRICK
He doesn’t wanna be my

LEE
It's not that. It's just the

Lee stops walking, then starts again.
LEE
The judge wouldn't let her. Anyway,
no one knows where she is.
PATRICK
I do. She's in Connecticut. At

Lee stops walking again.
LEE

PATRICK
She emailed me last year. So I
emailed her back. You know, email?

They start walking again.

PATRICK
Whoa, whoa, where’re we goin’?
LEE
It’s in Beverly.

*

PATRICK
There’s no funeral homes in
Manchester?
No.

LEE

*

PATRICK
This whole town is like one
gigantic graveyard for our family
and there’s no funeral homes?

*
*
*
*

LEE
No. (Pause) The cemetery's here...

*

PATRICK
Well, can you let me out? I'll just
walk home.

*

LEE
Let’s just get this done.
PATRICK
You wanna warn me if there's any
other Surprise Death Errands we
gotta run? Or is this gonna be it
for today?

*

60.
LEE
Yes. Sorry. This is it.

EXT. GALLAGHER’S FUNERAL HOME. DUSK.

Lee and Patrick walk away. The wind is punishing.
PATRICK
What is with that guy and the big
Serious and Somber Act?

*
*
*

LEE
I don't know.

*
*

PATRICK
But seriously, does he not realize
that people know he does this every
single day?

*
*
*
*

LEE
I don't know. Who cares? (Stops) I
think I parked the other way.
Sorry.

*
*
*
*

They reverse direction and start walking into the wind.

*

PATRICK
Why can't we bury him?

*
*

LEE
It's too cold. The ground’s too
hard. They’ll bury him in the
Spring.

*
*
*
*

PATRICK
So what do they do with him til
then?

*
*
*

LEE
They put him in a freezer.

*
*

PATRICK
Are you serious?

*
*

61.
LEE
Yeah. That's what they do with
them. They put ‘em in a big freezer
until the ground thaws out.

*
*
*
*

PATRICK
That really freaks me out.

*
*

LEE
It doesn’t matter. It isn't him.
It's just his body. Where’d I park
the car?

*
*
*
*

PATRICK
What about one of those mini-steam
shovels?

*
*
*

What?

LEE

PATRICK
I once saw one of those mini-steam
shovels one time in a graveyard in
New Haven. It dug a perfect little
hole in about two seconds.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

LEE
I don’t...really know how you would
get ahold of one. Or how much it
would cost -PATRICK
Why can't we just look into it?
LEE
Anyway, I’m pretty sure you can’t
use heavy equipment in the Central
Cemetary.
Why not?

PATRICK

*
*
*
*
*
*

LEE
Because there’s a lot of important
people buried there, and their
desecendents don’t want a steam
shovel vibratin’ over their dead
bodies. How do I know?

*
*
*
*
*
*

PATRICK
Why can't we bury him someplace
else?

*
*
*

LEE
That’s where he bought a plot.
Don’t ask me why.
(MORE)

*
*
*

62.
LEE (CONT'D)
But if you wanna find someplace
else to bury him, and find out how
much it costs, and change all the
arrangements with the mortician and
the cemetary, and call up Sacred
Heart and talk to Father Martin,
and change the arrangements for the
funeral service, be my guest.
Otherwise let's just leave it. OK?

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

They turn onto a SIDE STREET. The wind picks up brutally.

*

PATRICK
I just don't like him bein’ in a
freezer.

*
*
*

LEE
Oh come on! Where’s the Goddamn
car?

*

PATRICK
I don’t know, but I wish you’d
figure it out because I’m freezin’
my ass off.

*

LEE
Don’t you have a normal winter
coat?
Yes.

PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)
Why don’t you have gloves
with fingers on them?

Another gust of wind blows right through them.

*

PATRICK (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ!

*

LEE (CONT'D)
God damn it!

LEE (CONT’D)
Oh where the fuck did I park the
fucking car?

They see the car on a long sloping street and run to it. They
get in and slam the doors. Lee turns on the engine.
LEE
God damn it’s cold!
PATRICK
Why? What’s the matter with your
winter jacket?

63.
LEE
Seriously, Patty --?
It's on already!

PATRICK (CONT'D)
Just turn the heat on!

It's all the way up! It takes
a minute to warm up, so just
relax, OK?
Just be quiet.

Well turn it up a little!
It’s blowin’ fuckin’ freezin’
air on me.
What year did you buy this
thing? In the middle of the
fuckin’ Great Depression?

*

LEE
Patty, I swear to God -PATRICK
Why don’t we just keep my Dad in
here for the next three months?

*
*

LEE
Would you shut up about that
freezer please?

*

LEE (CONT’D)
You want me to have a nervous
breakdown because there's
undertakers and a funeral?

*

LEE (CONT’D)
-- Who cares?

*
*

No...!

*

PATRICK

*
*

Lee holds his hand over the vent.

*

LEE
‘K, it’s gettin’ warmer.

PATRICK
I got band practice. Can you drive
me home so I can get my stuff and
then take me over to my
girlfriend’s house?
Sure.

Lee pulls up in front of a small ranch house with a big front
yard. Patrick twists around to gets his stuff from the back.
LEE
This is the same girl as who was
over at the house?

64.
PATRICK
No. That was Silvie. This is Sandy.
But they don't know about each
other. So please don't say anything
in case it comes up.
I won’t.

Lee’s car pulls up to the curb. Stentorian thuds through the
frozen earth. Sandy’s mom, JILL, comes out and crosses the
lawn. She is 40, pretty and pleasant, hair in a pony tail.
Lee rolls down the window.
JILL
Hi, are you Lee? I'm Jill. Sandy’s
mom. I think they’re wrapping up.
Do you wanna come inside and have
beer or something?

*

65.
LEE
No, I’m fine. Thank you.
JILL
I wanted to offer my condolences
about Joe. He was such a terrific
guy. There's not too many like him.
Thank you.

LEE

JILL
I was -- I was gonna ask Patrick if
he wants to stay for supper, if
that's OK with you. You wanna join
us? I made way too much...
LEE
Oh. That’s all right. Thank you.
What time should I come back?
JILL
Oh -- I don’t know. Nine? Nine
thirty? They’re gonna do their
homework together. Supposedly. Ha
ha ha.
LEE
OK. I’ll come back at nine-thirty.
JILL
OK. You change your mind in the

Patrick and Sandy are making out on her bed. Patrick’s hand
is halfway down the front of Sandy’s complicated jeans.
SANDY
Hold on -- Hold on.
Just take your hand out.

PATRICK
Jesus Christ, I’m scrapin’
the skin off my knuckles. How
do you unbuckle this?

SANDY
Would you please take your hand
outta my cunt?

66.
PATRICK
OK, OK! (Withdraws his hand) Ow!

*

Sandy wriggles out of her jeans. Patrick tries to take off
his pants, but one leg bunches up at his ankle. He kicks to
get it off. She tries to help him.
Come on!

*

SANDY

PATRICK
I’m tryin’!
O.C., Jill KNOCKS on the DOOR. The kids both scramble away
from each other and frantically start to dress.
JILL (O.C.)
Hey kids? Come on have some dinner!
PATRICK
OK, thanks Jill! We'll be
down in just one second.
I just gotta log off...!

Lee is on the sofa with his iPhone and a beer, watching a
Celtics game. A PHONE RINGS. He looks around, confused. Looks
at his cell. Gets up and looks at the plastic bag with Joe’s
cell in it. Finally he realizes Joe’s LAND LINE is ringing.
LEE
(Answering)
Hello?
RANDI
(Over the phone)
Hello...Lee? It’s Randi. (Pause)
Hello? Lee?
Pause.
LEE
Yeah. I’m here. Sorry. How are you?
RANDI
I’m OK. How are you?
Good.

LEE

RANDI
I was callin’ -- George told me
about Joe. I just wanted to call
and say I’m sorry. I hope you don’t
mind me callin’.
LEE
No. Thank you. I don’t mind...How
are you?
RANDI
Not so good, right now. I guess we
shoulda seen it comin’, but...it’s
still kinda hard to believe...
Yeah...

LEE

RANDI
How’s Patrick doin’? Beyond the
obvious, obviously...
LEE
He’s OK. It’s hard to tell with
kids.
Yeah --

RANDI

Well, that’s good.

LEE (CONT'D)
He doesn’t really open up
with me. I think he’s OK.
He’s got a lotta
friends...So...Yeah, it is...

68.
RANDI
So, I don't know if you planned a
service yet, but I was also gonna
ask you if you wouldn't mind -- I'd
like to be there, if it's OK with
you.
LEE
Of course you can...
RANDI
OK. Thank you. It would mean
a lot to me -- OK -- Thank
you.

LEE (CONT'D)
That's fine. You should come.
I'll let you know when it's
gonna be.

RANDI
Thank you. (Pause) So, can I ask -How are you?
LEE
I don’t know. How are you?
RANDI
You know. We're doin’ pretty well.
I should probably tell you -- I’m
gonna be -- I’m pregnant. Actually.
Oh yeah?

LEE

RANDI
Yeah. Like -- Ready to pop.
LEE
Oh, I didn't know that.

RANDI (CONT'D)
I didn’t know if I should
tell you, but --

*

LEE
No, it’s fine. Congratulations.
RANDI
Thank you. You would probably
deduce it for yourself when you see
me.
Yeah.

LEE

Lee is unable to stay on the phone any longer.
RANDI
So, are you still --

LEE (CONT'D)
Actually, sorry -- I don’t
mean to cut you off. I just
gotta go pick up Patrick up
and I’m slightly late.

*

69.
RANDI
That’s OK. I just wanted to make
sure it’s OK if me and Josh come to
the funeral.
LEE
It’s totally OK.
RANDI
OK. Thank you, Lee. God bless.
So long.

LEE

They hang up. Lee tries to keep a grip on himself. He sits
and un-mutes the Celtics game on Joe’s 32” FLAT SCREEN TV.

A large grief-stricken crowd of mourners is obscuring a
burial plot in the “new” cemetary across the street from the
historic Central Cemetary. At the center of the mourners are
THREE HEADSTONES. We see RANDI, supported by her parents and
brothers. FATHER MARTIN, 50s, reads on, with a shaking voice,
and sprinkles Holy Water on the grave sites.
FATHER MARTIN
“and receive Susanna Marie,
Katherine Grace, and Stanley Joshua
into the arms of your mercy. We ask
this through Christ the Lord.
Amen.”
Amen.

As people sniffle and sob, he turns to another place he has

EXT. JOE’S BOAT - AT SEA. SUMMER -- DAY.

120

Younger slimmer Lee drives the boat. Younger slimmer Joe
talks to the boatful of summer passengers. The air is mild,
the sea is calm. The coast is visible in the distance. A
small noisy group from South Boston is clowning around.
JOE
A full grown humpback male averages
about 45 to 50 feet long, weighin’
in around 45 tons. The females are
slightly larger, averagin’ around
50 to 55 feet long, but weighin’
about the same. Which means that,
as with human beings, the female is
the more slender and domineering of
the sexes. That’s just a little
whale humor. Now, some of these
animals will migrate as far as
40,000 miles a year. But some of
them will stay in these waters year
round, and we don’t -- There we go!
See the spout? Right off the stern.
Right there -Oooooh!

THE TOURISTS

Everyone stands and points at a WHALE that has appeared a few
hundred feet away. Lee wheels the boat around to get closer.
Two more whales BLOW.
JOE
OK, we’re gonna turn around and get
a little closer...
A YOUNG SOUTH BOSTON WOMAN
Oh my God, it’s Wanda the
whale! Wanda the whale!

TOURISTS
Ohhhh/ Oh my God/ Wow, etc.

Oop, we got more -A YOUNG SOUTH BOSTON WOMAN
Oh my God, I got tears in my eyes.
I do. I got tears in my eyes. I
swear to God! It's Wanda the Whale!

More spouts blow in succession all around. There are several
whales in the vicinity now. LEE and JOE murmur to each other.
JOE
“Wanda the whale...?”
LEE
Joe, honestly? I’m gonna kill
this fuckin’ bitch.

Then a very pregnant RANDI gives Patrick a big warm hug. She
and her husband, JOSH, greet Lee. Randi says a few words to
Lee. Josh shakes Lee’s hand. Then they move away.
Others come through: Grownups and kids. DR BETHANY and her
HUSBAND. George stays dutifully by Lee.

is across the room talking to CJ, Joel and some other kids.
LATER -- PATRICK is in an armchair, watching LEE through the
press of chatting mourners. Lee holds a beer and looks lost.
TOM DOHERTY appears, shakes Lee’s hand and gives him a hug
which Lee rigidly returns. MRS DOHERTY kisses Lee.
SILVIE appears at Patrick’s side. She gives him some soda in
a plastic cup. Her eyes intrusively search his face.

I’m OK.

Yes. But that doesn’t mean I

PATRICK (CONT'D)
Anyway, what’s in Boston?
You’re a janitor.

PATRICK
You could do that anywhere. There’s
toilets and clogged-up drains all

You can’t maintain it --

No! No! No!
No! I’m just freakin’ out.
Just go away!

No we don’t --!

LEE
I said open up the door. Are
you havin’ a breakdown?
Should I take you to the

Fine, but I can’t let you
freak out with the door shut.
And if you’re gonna freak out
every time you see a frozen
chicken I think maybe we
should take you the hospital.
I don’t know anything about
this.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

You’ve expressed that very clearly.
I don't like it either. But there’s

She’s in Essex. She wants me to see
her new house and meet her fiancee.

couldn’t get in touch with me?

I hung up because I didn’t know

There is nobody else.
PATRICK
I can live in Essex with my Mom.
LEE
No you can’t.
PATRICK
But if she's not an alcoholic
anymore and she wants me to stay
with her, then I can take the bus

INT. WATERFRONT BAR & GRILLE. DAY.

187

CU LEE, very drunk. He is at the counter of a busy local
place full of fishermen eating and drinking their lunch. A
new bunch of guys comes in loudly and boisterously. One of
them accidentally clips Lee as the group passes by.
FISHERMAN
Sorry, buddy.
Lee whirls around and sucker-punches the Fisherman. He goes
down hard. His friends immediately grab at Lee en masse.
FISHERMEN
Hey! Hey! What’re you doin’? Etc.
Lee is pushed into some tables -- The whole place is in an
uproar -- He is jumped by several guys. He keeps fighting
crazily. Someone tries to pin his arms to stop the fight.
Everyone is shouting.
GEORGE appears. He uses his size to shove the other guys away
from Lee.
GEORGE
Break it up! Break it up! It's Lee
Chandler. Lee! Let him go, Eddy.
He's Joey Chandler's brother.
(MORE)

102.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Let him go! Lee. Lee! It's George.
Lee. Come on -- (To the guys who
beat Lee up) You won. OK? You won
the fight.
Lee shoves George away and swings at the nearest man.
Everybody pounces on him again. Someone hits Lee squarely and
knocks him down. Now George is fighting everybody. Chaos.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
OK, OK, OK!
188

INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

188

Lee is dazed, lying on the sofa in George's cramped living
room. George watches anxiously as George’s wife JANINE
finishes washing and bandaging Lee’s banged up face. George
is a little banged up too.
JANINE
...Should we take him to the
hospital?
GEORGE
I don't think so. Nothin’s broken.
JANINE
...What the hell did they do to
him?
GEORGE
They all just said he started
swingin’.
A FEW MINUTES LATER -- Lee is now fully awake. George stands
over him. Janine sits by him, dabbing his swollen bruises.
LEE
Where’s Patrick?
GEORGE
He’s with the kids. I sent ‘em out
for burgers.
LEE
Lemme give you some money.
Lee sits up painfully and reaches for his wallet.
GEORGE
Lee. Please. It‘s my treat.
Lee stands up and fumbles for his wallet and drops it on the
floor. George picks it up and gives it to him.

*

103.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Would you sit down please, for
Christ’s sake?
OK.

LEE

Lee sits down and breaks into tears.
GEORGE
Come on, buddy.
George looks uncomfortable. He looks up toward the kitchen.
Janine comes back in with coffee and sits next to Lee.
LEE
I’m sorry...
GEORGE
That’s OK, buddy. It’s OK...
JANINE
Lee? Have some coffee. Come on.
Drink this...
Lee takes the coffee and keeps crying. George and Janine
exchange a look.

HOMEOWNER
What do you think?
LEE
I think you’re gonna be OK.
HOMEOWNER
Are you one of Stan Chandler’s
boys?
LEE
Yeah, I’m Lee.
HOMEOWNER
I used to play a little chess with

Slowly he falls sleep...A LITTLE HAND tugs at his SLEEVE.
Daddy?

SUZY (O.C.)

He turns his head and sees without surprise his DAUGHTERS
seated next to him in their nightgowns. The BABY is in
playpen on the floor. SUZY, 7, is pulling his sleeve. Lee
smiles at them.

Everything’s OK!

Lee and Patrick eat dinner.
LEE
My Boston job came through. It
doesn’t start until July.
PATRICK
What is it?
LEE
Custodian, handyman...But just two
buildings this time.
PATRICK
And what delightful Boston
neighborhood are we gonna be
livin’ in?

LEE (CONT'D)
I was gonna tell y --

LEE (CONT’D)
You don’t have to move to Boston.

108.
PATRICK
I don't? (Pause) That's great!
LEE
I’m gonna be in Charlestown. George
is gonna take you.
What?

PATRICK

LEE
Yeah. I talked to them last month -So, but --

PATRICK

LEE
I explained the situation to them.
Georgie Junior’s goin’ to school
this Fall. Jimmy graduates next
year. We’ll have to rent out this
house. You can move back in when
you turn eighteen. When you turn
twenty-one, you’re allowed to sell
it or stay in it, or whatever you
want. Definitely have to hire the
boat out when the summer’s over -I thought when you get your
licence, we can figure that one out
as we go. I'm still the trustee,
but all the financial stuff Joe set
up for me is gonna go to George. So
everything’ll be the same, except
you don’t have to move.
PATRICK
Well...I mean, thank you. That's
great. But...like, are they gonna
be my guardians? Or do you still -LEE
They’re gonna adopt you. (Pause)
Anyway, that's how I set it up. If
you want. It's up to you.
PATRICK
So are you gonna just
disappear?

LEE (CONT'D)
You don’t have to do it. No.
No. I just set it up so you
can stay here. They’re really
glad to have you. They love
you.

PATRICK
I know. I mean, they’re great...But
why can’t you stay?
Patty starts crying.

PATRICK
I know you feel bad...!
Come on...

LEE

PATRICK
Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
I don’t mean like, you’re
ever gonna be like -- I know
you feel bad.

LEE
I can’t do it. I can’t beat
it. I can’t beat it.

LEE
...I’m sorry.
Patrick wipes his eyes. Lee comes over and hugs him.

110.

Go ahead.

LEE

PATRICK
Can I have some money?
Yes.

LEE

Lee gives him a ten dollar bill. Patrick goes inside. Lee
bounces the ball against the store wall. It takes a bad
bounce. He runs and grabs it as it rolls down the hill. He
walks back up. Patrick comes out with an ice cream bar.
PATRICK
So...When am I supposed to move in
with Georgie?
LEE
July. I don’t even have a place to
live yet.

*

PATRICK
Don’t they give you an apartment?
LEE
Yeah, but I was gonna try to get a
place with an extra room. Or room
for like a pull-out sofa.
What for?

PATRICK

LEE
In case you wanna visit sometime.
Or if you’re lookin’ at colleges in
Boston or somethin’ and you wanna
stay overnight...
PATRICK
I’m not goin’ to college.
LEE
Then I'll have an extra room for
all my shit. Do we have to talk
about this now?
Nope.

PATRICK

He tosses away his ice-cream stick.
LEE
I want...I thought we oughta stay
in touch. I don’t wanna just...

PATRICK
Then why can’t we -LEE
I would stay here if I could. But
it's impossible. Everybody wants me
to recover. But it's -- I can't -bounce back. But I don’t just wanna
go back there and die...!
PATRICK
We could call that guy about
the house and say we changed
our mind.
Why not?

LEE (CONT'D)
I'll still be the trustee.
I'll go on the boat with you.
But I can't -- No. No...

PATRICK

LEE
It's impossible...I can't explain.
PATRICK
It’s OK, Uncle Lee.
LEE
Could we discuss this plan
tomorrow?
OK, sure.
Thank you.

PATRICK
LEE

After a minute Lee wipes his eyes. He bounces the ball and
tosses it to Patrick. It goes wide and bounces crazily.
PATRICK
Great throw.
LEE
Just leave it.
Patrick runs to gets the ball. They continue to walk up the
hill, bouncing the ball across the street to each other and
chasing it when it rolls back down the hill.

STAN
Hey, hey, hey hey!

The REEL WHIRS merrily as the big fish runs...
A GRAY WHALE BREACHES the water TWENTY FEET AWAY.
Whoaaa!

EVERYBODY ON BOARD

The SPLASH drenches them. The WAKE rocks the boat.
STAN/JOE
Joe, your line, your line!/
Holy smokes!

LEE
You lost your fish, you

RANDI/ELISE
Holy Christ!/Oh My God!

SUZY/PATRICK

The WHALE BREACHES again -- even CLOSER -- beyond enormous.
Whoaaaaaa!

As the whale crashes down the SPLASH breaks over them...
EVERYONE
Whoooooooohoooooo!
The boat rocks dizzily over the enormous wake.
FROM OVERHEAD -- We see the little boat among dozens of
others bobbing in the sea, with the dark shapes of the whales
moving under the water all around them.
