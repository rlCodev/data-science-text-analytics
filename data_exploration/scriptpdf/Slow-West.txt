SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
Once upon a time, 1870 to be exact,
a sixteen year old kid travelled
from the cold shoulder of Scotland,
to the baking heart of America to
find his love. His name was Jay her name was Rose
FADE IN:
2

EXT - COLORADO FOREST - NIGHT

2

Our hero, JAY CAVENDISH lies on a blanket, a colt six-shooter
gun in his hand, and looks up to a sky full of stars
He begins his nightly recital, naming each constellation
JAY
Pegasus, The Great Bear, The
Dragon, Andromeda
JAY is sixteen, skinny, dark hair and dark eyes, handsome in
an other-worldly way
He is about to sleep fully clothed, and what fine clothes
they are - an exquisitely tailored three piece suit and fine
leather boots
JAY lifts his gun up and points to the night sky and pretends
to shoot
He makes a soft sound on each ‘pretend shot’ and a star
appears and forms Orion
JAY (CONT’D)
Orion’s Belt
JAY lowers his gun and smiles as he remembers the love of his
life, ROSE ROSS

JAY stows away his gun, tucks his wallet into his inside
pocket, rolls onto his side, shuts his eyes and falls asleep

EXT - COLORADO FOREST - DAWN

Next day, first light, dawn chorus, JAY rolls up his blanket
and grabs his duffle bag
TITLE - SLOW WEST
JAY sits on his horse. His horse is laden with many bags,
cases, blankets, boxes
JAY pulls out a small wooden box and lifts lid to reveal a
compass
JAY rides off in the direction - WEST
He rides awkwardly though the trees, holding the compass
aloft
6

EXT - EDGE OF FOREST / PRAIRIE - DAY

6

JAY rides out of the forest into an open grass prairie
The sun now beats down
Strange structures appear. Dotted across the prairie, bodies
wrapped in cloth lie on stilts facing the sky
A Native burial ground, a happy hunting ground
The stilts are adorned with feathers and beads
JAY weaves through the structures and past a group of native
women sitting, preparing dead bodies of men wrapped in cloth
JAY rides past. The women ignore him
7

EXT - FOREST - DAY
Into the forest
A line of native women and children pass JAY
The final native, carrying a baby looks at JAY as he passes
JAY rides on, bringing his compass out again and continuing
West

JAY has another flashing memory of ROSE and their time
together in Scotland

EXT - SCOTLAND - HILLSIDE - DREAM FLASHBACK

8

A strong wind blowing, a heathery landscape and beyond a
rough sea
Rose stands on top of a small rock formation and lifts her
arms causing her shawl to flap in the wind
JAY sits next to her
ROSE turns and smiles at JAY, then leaps from the small rock
and runs down the hill
CUT TO:

EXT - FOREST - DAY

JAY rides into a cloud of dense smoke
The forest air becomes ‘foggy’ until JAY is but a faint
silhouette
He and his pony begin to cough
JAY covers his mouth with cloth
The air is thick with ash
Black jagged shapes- burnt stumps of trees emerge from the
grey
Now only shades of grey
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
I was drifting west when I picked
up his trail - deep in Colorado
Territory - A jack-rabbit in a den
of wolves, fortunate to be alive
(The voice over is an older man than JAY, with an Irish
accent - Later we will meet the man who owns this voice)
JAY, now walking his horse, has covered his mouth with a
handkerchief
JAY is covered head to toe in gray ash, and so is his horse
JAY enters a clearing
Remains of tee-pee frames and tree stumps smoulder black and
smoke

4.
This was a Native camp, freshly razed to the ground
JAY leads his horse through the remains
No bodies. The dead removed
Another forest clearing
A distant gun shot startles JAY and his horse
JAY stops
Another gun shot
Then another
JAY walks slowly from his horse
More gunshots
Branches snap under foot from yonder, the sound of someone
running towards JAY
A muscular young NATIVE MAN sprints from the brush and skids
to a halt in front of JAY
Bare chested, coated in blood
Standing proud and waiting as if preparing to die by JAY’S
hand
JAY ash-grey
The young MAN blood-red
For a moment they study each other’s strangeness
Another gunshot and the NATIVE MAN looks around then bolts
past JAY
More rustling and twig snapping as THREE MEN dressed as Union
soldiers emerge
TWO BOYS in dirty old Yankee uniforms and an OLDER MAN in an
officer’s outfit
Guns are quickly raised to point at JAY
OFFICER
Arms abroad boy!
JAY raises his arms up
YOUNG SOLDIER 2
Red skinned or white?
The coat of ash covering JAY the source of confusion

5.
JAY
Sir. I am British.. Scottish
The officer barks orders to his two protegés
OFFICER
Catch the savage
The two YOUNG SOLDIERS run off into the woods
JAY and the OFFICER stare at each other for a BEAT
Two muffled gunshots then silence
The OFFICER smiles, thinking the NATIVE has been killed
JAY
I am Jay Cavendish, Son of Lady
Cavendish
OFFICER lowers his rifle and walks towards JAY
OFFICER
We’re all Sons of Bitches
Seemingly from thin air, a figure appears behind the OFFICER
and cocks his gun by the OFFICER’S ear, while taking the
OFFICER’s gun in one smooth action
This is SILAS SELLECK
Mid thirties, lean, fit
SILAS is dirt ingrained, only his eyes are clean
SILAS looks WILD, yet..
His movements are skillful, economic, fast, his posture
confident, capable and in control to the point of blasé
Succinct in words and action
OFFICER (CONT’D)
A grave play, boy
JAY draws his gun and points it at SILAS
JAY
Sir. Lower your pistol
SILAS sighs, then slowly circles round continuing to hold his
gun to the OFFICER’S head, and moves towards JAY
Hey !

JAY (CONT’D)

SILAS moves up to JAY, continuing to point the gun at the
OFFICER, and snatches JAY’S gun from him

6.
SILAS points JAY’S gun at the OFFICER and pulls the trigger,
but the gun is empty and clicks
The officer smiles at this, but quick as a flash, SILAS
raises his own gun up and shoots the officer between the eyes
Dead before he hits the ground
Without taking his eyes off the officer, SILAS throws JAY’S
gun him
SILAS
Clean it. Oil it
JAY fumbles the catch
SILAS walks over to the officer and crouches down
Pulls out a large knife and
belt

cuts a pouch from the officers

JAY looks on
JAY
What do you want?
SILAS checks the contents of the pouch and stuffs it into his
belt
JAY (CONT’D)
He was an Officer
SILAS looks through the man’s pockets and finds a tin
SILAS
Wearin’ a dress don’t make her a
lady
SILAS pockets the tin
SILAS (CONT’D)
They ain’t soldiers. Least no more.
Indian slayers
SILAS moves round and removes the OFFICER’s boots and
addresses JAY without looking up
SILAS (CONT’D)
Keep headin’ West solo you’ll be
dead by dawn. How you made it this
far is a miracle
JAY
I take care of myself

7.
SILAS
Sure kid. You need chaperonin’ and
I’m a chaperone
SILAS gets up and walks towards JAY
JAY takes a step back, still holding his gun
SILAS walks past JAY and towards JAY’s horse
JAY
Safer to travel with a killer?
SILAS
That’s right
SILAS checks out JAY’s laden horse. Too many bags and cases
for a small pony to carry
SILAS begins to cut the bags free
SILAS (CONT’D)
First lets save your pony’s life
SILAS cuts a case free and it drops to the ground
SILAS (CONT’D)
I counted a dozen of them bastards
attack them Indians back there.
Minus three that leaves.. too many
JAY’s turns and looks into the woods in all directions
SILAS, now down on his knees, rakes through JAY’s case.
Tosses out a kettle, throws a useless box over his shoulder.
Tosses boots and a shirt
Finds a book, looks at the cover and holds it up to JAY
JAY reads the title
JAY
‘Ho for the West. A traveller and
Emigrants Hand-book
SILAS keeps looking at JAY
JAY (CONT’D)
To Canada and the North West States
of America’..
SILAS keeps staring
JAY (CONT’D)
..By Edward Hepple Hall
SILAS throws the book over his shoulder

8.
SILAS
Well ho for the West
SILAS casts the whole case aside, gets up and walks towards
JAY
SILAS (CONT’D)
Dollars. Fifty now, fifty when we
split
JAY turns his back to SILAS and fumbles in his wallet
Turns back around and hands SILAS fifty dollars
JAY
Until we reach a forest called
Silverghost
SILAS snatches the cash, counts it, and walks off
Lets drift

SILAS

JAY runs around and picks up his ‘Ho for the West’ book,
grabs the reins of his pony and follows SILAS

JAY rides behind SILAS through the forest, brushing the
remaining ash from his hair and suit
JAY trots up level with SILAS
JAY
What’s your name?
SILAS snaps
SILAS
Drop back, single file
JAY drops back behind SILAS
SILAS leads, JAY follows, staying single file as instructed
JAY (SHOUTS)
Why you headin’ West?
SILAS does not respond
JAY (CONT’D)
You care not why I’m headed West?
No response

9.
JAY (CONT’D)
There was an accident - My girl and
her father fled from Scotland,
settled out West. It was all my
fault
SILAS (TO HIMSELF)
Take a hint kid?
JAY
We love each other
SILAS (TO HIMSELF)
Sure you do, kid
They ride on in silence
Close up of JAY, sound of waves breaking - Another memory of
Rose

EXT -

SCOTTISH SAND DUNES - FLASHBACK - DAY

11

Moody grey sky
Large waves crash onto a sandy beach, the beach becomes sand
dunes
JAY stands at the top of a large dune
ROSE, standing at the bottom, shouts up to JAY
ROSE
JAY! A thousand ways to die, choose
one
JAY strikes a thinking pose
JAY
Bow and arrow
She pulls a pretend arrow from a pretend quiver and pretend
fires it at JAY
JAY pretends to be shot in the heart and falls dramatically
He rolls down the dune to ROSE’s feet and lays still, face
up, eyes shut, tongue out
ROSE jumps on top of JAY and smiles. (This is the moment we
saw in JAY’s first memory at the beginning of the film)
JAY’S eyes are shut, ROSE places her hand on JAY’S chest and
leans in, her ear to his chest, continuing the charade by
checking if JAY is breathing
JAY places his hands on Rose’s hands

10.
ROSE smiles, but pulls away, breaking the moment, pushes
JAY’s head to the side
Silly boy

ROSE

ROSE jumps up
Runs up the dune, shouting
My turn

ROSE (CONT’D)

JAY looks up to the sky

EXT - LIGHT FOREST - DAY

12

JAY rides behind SILAS
Low light, long shadows
Distant echo of a pretty acapella song emanates from the
trees ahead
JAY head slumped, the music stirs him from his daydream
Three AFRICAN MEN, clothed in dusty ragged Union soldier
suits, sit in a circle, one in a makeshift wooden wheel
chair, one on crutches, wounds from the Civil War
They sing a beautiful Congolese song. (They’re Congolese)
SILAS rides straight past, JAY stops to listen
SILAS stops, grumps, spits, and turns
SILAS wolf whistles, JAY ignores
SILAS shakes his head, turns and trots off
The band smile, singing for the pleasure of singing. The song
ends and the man on crutches looks up at JAY
SINGER (IN FRENCH)
Did you enjoy our music?
JAY answers in French
JAY (IN FRENCH)
Yes. I enjoyed the song very much
SINGER (IN FRENCH)
It’s a song about love

11.
JAY (IN FRENCH)
Love is universal, like death
JAY nods to the band, who start playing again, and rides
after SILAS

EXT - DRY LAKE, DEAD TREE, FLOWERS - DAY

The Sun bakes the land. JAY and SILAS keep heading WEST
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
The kid was a wonder. He saw things
differently. To him we were in a
land of hope and good will. The way
I saw it, kick over any rock and
most likely a desperado would crawl
out and knife you right in the
heart if there was a dollar in it

EXT - RIDGE OVERLOOKING DRIED RIVER BED - DAY

14

A rag-tag posse of seven men and a woman, all on horseback,
form a row and watch a distant SILAS and JAY cross the river
bed
The posse are all distinct and characterful
A Chinese man, ‘TATOO MAN’, in traditional Chinese garb, long
black hair and beard
A Dylan-esque musician ‘THE MINSTREL’ with a feather in his
hat and a banjo strapped to his back
A Mexican woman, poncho and braids ‘MARIMACHO’
A wizened ol’ gold-digger type. Large soft hat, silver beard this is SKELLY
A good looking young kid, arrogant expression. This is ‘THE
KID’
A crazy looking goggle-eyed man, aged beyond his years by
drugs and liquor. This is PEYOTE JOE
The gang leader - PAYNE - Massive fur coat, cigar
PAYNE watches SILAS and JAY with added interest and a knowing
half smile

SILAS and JAY have set up camp
JAY sits on his blanket, SILAS up against a tree
JAY throws rabbit bones from his plate into the trees
SILAS sees this
JAY lies back and looks at the stars while SILAS is filling
bullet shells with fresh gunpowder
JAY
Same stars. Same moon
SILAS ignores him
JAY (CONT’D)
One day we’ll be wandering ‘round
that moon
SILAS ignores
JAY (CONT’D)
They’ll build a railroad
SILAS keeps ignoring
JAY (CONT’D)
But a railroad up and down the
ways. A railroad to the moon. And
when we get there, first thing
we’ll do is hunt the natives down
SILAS bites
SILAS
No Indians on the moon
JAY sits up
JAY
No. The natives of the moon. The
moon people
SILAS flashes JAY an incredulous look
JAY lies back down, points to stars and begins his nightly
recital
JAY (CONT’D)
Pegasus, The Great Bear, The Dragon
A crackle of sticks under foot in the darkness
Shh!

SILAS

JAY shuts up
SILAS gets up, picks up rifle
JAY sits up
SILAS soldier-like, cocks rifle, moves off into the woods
JAY about to follow
Sit down

SILAS (CONT’D)

JAY obeys, and now feels more alone than he did when he was
alone..
JAY brings his gun out and stays still for a BEAT
SILAS emerges from the shadows
SILAS picks up Jay’s rabbit bones and throws them into the
fire
SILAS (CONT’D)
This is the last time I’m gonna
clean up your shit
SILAS sits back up against the tree, places his rifle on his
lap and covers himself with a blanket
SILAS’ way of saying good night
JAY looks around
Wolves howl
JAY lies back and stares up at the moon and stars and slowly
and quietly un-cocks his gun

SILAS and JAY walk their horses up through a yellowish rocky
canyon
The canyon narrows forming a pass a couple of yards wide

A buffalo has got trapped in the narrow gap and died there
It has been picked clean of meat down to its gleaming white
bones
The skeleton blocks the route WEST
JAY and SILAS approach
JAY
Must have been winter when Rose
passed through here
They begin to pull the heavy bones from between the rock
JAY lifts up the skull
SILAS
What’s she like?
JAY perks up
JAY
She’s a beauty. And.. She does not
waste words. They tumble out, wit
following wisdom
SILAS
You haven’t bedded her, have you
SILAS laughs
JAY shakes his head
SILAS gestures to the buffalo rib cage
SILAS (CONT’D)
Grab that end
JAY
You’re a brute
They lift the rib cage together and dump clear of the trail

SILAS and JAY ride up to the trading post
A small one room wooden shack, a veranda running along the
front
There is a horse tied up out front. It is jet black, shiny
and muscular
SILAS looks at the horse as he dismounts
SILAS
Tie the horses round back
JAY leads the horses round the side of the building
SILAS reaches the veranda
Left of the trading post door there is a makeshift notice
board fixed to the wall
SILAS turns to make sure JAY is out of sight, then checks all
the notices
Amongst a number of wanted posters of grim faced outlaws, a
wanted poster for ROSE ROSS and JOHN ROSS
Beneath a drawing of JOHN and ROSE, a crude likeness, reads JOHN ROSS and his daughter ROSE ROSS - ‘WANTED FOR MURDER REWARD $2000 DEAD OR ALIVE’
SILAS rips the poster from the board
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
Everyone knew about the bounty,
except Jay. He was leading me right
to it.
The trading post door swings open and a man exits. SILAS
turns his head
This is VICTOR THE HAWK - He is wearing a priest’s get-up,
white dog collar, black suit, black hat, perfectly groomed.
Everything about this man is long, sharp and clean
VICTOR carries a long black case, about the length of a large
rifle and probably containing a large rifle
For a brief moment he stops and looks at SILAS. A beat of
recognition between both men. SILAS looks down at the case,
VICTOR knows he knows.. A bounty hunter can smell another
bounty hunter
VICTOR tips his hat, walks off, mounts horse, rides off

16.
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
There were few of us left, men
beyond the law
SILAS walks into the trading post
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)

Inside the trading post is dark and dusty, shelves on all
sides are filled with necessities. Native blankets, furs,
buffalo skins, pots, pans, coffee, ammunition, saddle bags,
suits, boots, shovels, pan handles, horse shoes, bags of salt
and corn, jars of honey and rolls of string. (See p. 168
Little house in the big woods)
A counter runs along the back of the shop. In front of the
counter and to the left, two small wooden tables, four
chairs. To the right, more shelves piled high, and an
entrance to a small changing room covered by a large Native
rug
An OLD MAN stands behind the counter
SILAS walks up to the counter, strikes a match on the side,
lights his cigar
STOREKEEPER
May I ask you to place your iron on
the counter while you browse?
SILAS obliges, then wanders round the room checking the stock
JAY enters, closing the door behind him
SILAS
We’ll be dining
JAY wanders over to some clothes on a rail
JAY
May I try on a suit?
STOREKEEPER
Sure, be my guest
JAY crosses the room and enters the small changing room,
pulls closed the native blanket curtain

Whisky?

STOREKEEPER (CONT’D)

JAY brings his gun out from his inside pocket and lays it on
a stool

JAY tries on the suit jacket, notices a hole right by his
heart
The hole was made by a bullet and around the hole, dried red
crusts of the blood of the previous owner
JAY sticks his finger in the hole
SHOP FLOOR
The door swings open
A man and a woman enter

18.
They are Swedish, a young couple, clothes dusty from travel
They move nervously, jittery, eyes showing desperation. The
man JOHAN is skinny. (Ref: Shame by Bergman)
The woman MARIA, skinny but wears so many clothes and rags
and shawls that she looks larger
JOHAN notices SILAS and looks at MARIA with concern
SILAS keeps his eye on the man as he nervously approaches to
the counter
JOHAN points to a blanket on a high shelf behind the
storekeeper
JOHAN (SWEDISH ACCENT)
Blanket please
STOREKEEPER
Blanket, ha..
The storekeeper climbs on a stool and reaches up for a
blanket
While his back is turned, MARIA swipes some items and places
them in her bundle of bosom
STOREKEEPER (CONT’D)
Ma’am, you have to purchase items
before baggin’ ‘em. That's how we
do it here in America
SILAS alert
MARIA throws a sharp stare at JOHAN
Johan!

JOHAN follows his wive’s orders and smacks the storekeeper in
the face with the butt of his pistol
The storekeeper falls out of sight and rises with a shotgun
and shoots JOHAN point black in the chest
JOHAN is flung backwards against a post and falls down dead
MARIA in shock, pulls out a small pistol and fires it at the

JAY and ROSE sit side by side on the bed
JAY looks mournful, ROSE happy
ROSE makes a gun shape with her hand and pretends to shoot
JAY in the heart, and smiles
JAY makes an effort to smile back
JAY
How do you feel.. About me
ROSE turns serious
ROSE
You’re the little brother I never
had
JAY gutted, almost resentful
JAY
You don’t mean that. That’s not
what you mean
JAY looks at ROSE, that same longing look from the dunes
ROSE
I’m sorry my Romeo, but these
violent delights..
ROSE grabs JAY and tickles him
ROSE (CONT’D)
Have violent ends..
JAY stands up and turns to ROSE

JAY
What choice do you have? A farmer,
a fisherman!
ROSE’s smile wiped
ROSE
Best you leave now, Jay
ROSE hears a gate shut outside and springs into nervous
action, looking around for a place to hide JAY
He should not be in here
JOHN ROSS (O.S.)
No violence, we need protection,
crofters rights..
The voices of ROSE’s father, JOHN ROSS, and another MAN
approaching the door, ROSE panics

No

ROSE does not take no for an answer and pulls JAY under the

The atmosphere cuts dead when..
Another MAN enters, flanked by two BURLY MEN. This is RUPERT,

RUPERT drags JAY by the scruff of the neck out the door of
the Ross cottage, followed by JOHN ROSS, ROSE, and some of
the other MEN
JAY breaks free of RUPERT and walks to ROSE’s side
JAY
I’m with Rose now
This is news to ROSE, news to ROSE’s FATHER, and news to
RUPERT
RUPERT slowly approaches JAY
He lifts a hand to slap JAY, but instead slaps ROSE
This enrages JOHN ROSS, he grabs RUPERT and throws him
backwards to the ground
A thud as RUPERT smacks his head on a rock
The rock drips with blood and RUPERT looks all but dead
JAY runs off into the dark of night

EXT - CAMPFIRE - FOREST - DAWN

JAY turns to look at SILAS, fast asleep
JAY quietly and slowly rises up and rolls up his blanket all
the time watching SILAS
SILAS appears not to waken
JAY glances round camp to check he’s not left anything
SILAS opens his eyes and looks at JAY, then shuts his eyes
again
JAY creeps out of camp

Noon sun, JAY sleeps as he rides WEST
32

EXT - PLAINS - LATE AFTERNOON

32

Sun low, shadows long
JAY stops
In the distance a horse and wagon, a camp fire, one MAN
A DOG trots over from the camp towards JAY, a little wolflike scrubby mongrel
Pants happily, sits looking at JAY
JAY decides to approach the camp, slowly
The MAN now stands, rifle in hand
JAY stops again - within earshot of the MAN
The MAN places his gun down and waves
This man is WERNER. He has a kind, intelligent face, middle
aged, stubbly beard, (looks and sounds like Werner Herzog)
WERNER (GERMAN ACCENT)
Good evening!
JAY smiles at WERNER
JAY
I come in peace
WERNER smiles back
WERNER
My ears hear your music!
WERNER beckons JAY to join him
Come, come

WERNER (CONT’D)

JAY dismounts
WERNER giddily runs to the back of his wagon and pulls out a
second chair, places it next to his little fire
WERNER (CONT’D)
Sit. I have coffee
WERNER sits opposite , happy to have the company
JAY sits, looks down at a journal next to WERNER

27.
JAY
You a writer?
Perhaps

WERNER

WERNER holds up his journal. A long title fills the front
cover
He reads the title slowly
WERNER (CONT’D)
I am “Recording the decline of
aboriginal tribes - their customs,
culture and habits - In the hope of
preventing their extinction or
conversion to Christianity” - The
title of my account. Too long?
Perhaps

JAY

WERNER lays the book down
WERNER
So now. East. What news?
JAY looks East
JAY
Violence and suffering, and West?
Werner looks West
WERNER
Dreams and toil
JAY
I passed though burnt remains of an
Indian camp
WERNER saddened, picks up his journal
WERNER
This is dreadful news
A race extinct, their culture
banished, their places re-named,
only then will they be viewed with
selective nostalgia, mythologised
and romanticised in the safe guise
of art.. And literature
Werner holds up the journal on ‘literature’
WERNER (CONT’D)
This is a new world for us, also
for them

28.
Sun setting, light fading
WERNER gets up walks towards his wagon
WERNER (CONT’D)
You must be hungry
He roots around the back of the wagon. He has all sorts in
there, about four saddles, many bags, much junk
He finds some bread and brings it to JAY
JAY
‘Til now my sole company’s been a
brute
WERNER
Sorry to hear this
I escaped

JAY

WERNER hands JAY bread, sits back down
JAY takes a bite of bread
Thank you

JAY (CONT’D)

EXT - WERNER CAMP - NIGHT
Camp surrounded by blackness
JAY and WERNER lit by the fire, the back of WERNER’s wagon
lit by a lamp
JAY
I killed a woman yesterday
WERNER
Part and parcel
WERNER warms his hands by the flames
JAY
You care not to share your company
with a murderer?
WERNER
I’d be a lonely man if I did
WERNER shakes his head
WERNER(CONT’D)
I am no Judge nor Father

33

29.
WERNER now looks devilish in the light of the flames
WERNER (CONT’D)
In a short time, this will be a
long time ago
Distant wolves howl
WERNER picks up his rifle and stands up
WERNER (CONT’D)
Camp here. Blanket?
JAY nods
Thank you

JAY

WERNER returns to the back of the wagon and pulls out a
blanket, brings it to JAY
WERNER
I shall dream up some advice and in
the morning dish it up with fresh
eggs
JAY
What’s your name?
Werner

WERNER

JAY
I’m Jay. Good night and thank you
Werner
WERNER nods, turns, climbs into the back of his wagon and
shuts the doors
JAY alone under the vast starry sky
34

EXT - PLAINS - DAWN

When JAY wakes up in the morning he is more than alone again.
WERNER has gone, and taken JAY’S horse, all JAY’s
possessions, clothes, everything
JAY sits up in his all-in-one long Johns and looks around
Stands up
Looks down, a chicken egg sits on a note
Picks up the egg, the note flaps along the ground
JAY runs after it, grabs the note and reads

30.
NOTE- “West” and a arrow
JAY looks at the arrow west and turns round with the paper in
his hand before realising the joke of having an arrow west
drawn..
JAY throws the note to the wind, angry and amused in equal
measure
Drapes the blanket over his shoulder
Tries to peal the shell from the egg
Picks up a small stone to chip the egg shell, and the egg
breaks, but it is raw, not boiled, and drips to the ground

JAY wanders across the vast windy plain

EXT - PLAINS - DAY

36

JAY's now staggering, hungry, tired
He spots a few mushrooms sprouting from the dust
He throws himself to the ground dramatically, like he hasn’t
eaten for a week
Sniffs the mushrooms
The wind blowing hard, has prevented JAY from hearing a horse
approach from behind him
The shadow of the man on the horse slides over JAY
JAY turns round to see SILAS and he has JAY'S horse in tow,
possessions intact
SILAS (O.S.)
You can eat those
SILAS nods at the mushrooms
SILAS (CONT’D)
Eat enough of them, you can fly to
Rose
JAY looks at his horse and looks at SILAS
JAY
You kill Werner?
SILAS takes time to shape his answer

31.
SILAS
No. No reason
JAY goes to his horse and brings out his wallet from his suit
Pulls out the rest of his money and holds it out to SILAS
JAY
This is all the money I have. Get
me there in one piece
SILAS takes the money
Sure kid

SILAS

SILAS hands JAY a biscuit
SILAS (CONT’D)

EXT - FOREST - DAY

SILAS and JAY have stopped and are looking at something in
the woods
JAY
That's a shame
Is it?

SILAS

We see what they are looking at
A tree has been chopped down and fallen on top of the feller,
completely squishing him
His arms stick out as if a cartoon, his flesh long gone, his
clothes disintegrating, his skeleton hand still grasps the
axe
JAY
No. No, it's not
Both men smile at each other

32.
Nothing like someone else's misfortune to bond a friendship
JAY (CONT’D)
Charles Darwin talks of ‘evolution

SILAS
For our sake lets hope he's wrong

The men ride on, SILAS is riding in front of JAY
JAY is singing
JAY
My lord is hunting he has gone,
hounds and hawks with him are none,
beyond Silverghost lies his game,
Rose Ross is her name
SILAS puts on his jacket for no reason other than to bring
out the ROSE and JOHN ROSS Wanted poster
SILAS checks that JAY is not looking (JAY is not)
SILAS looks at the drawing of ROSE, flips it over and looks
at the $2000, flips it back to ROSE, then pockets it
40

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER IN FOREST - DAY TO EVENING

40

A pretty clearing in the forest, dappled light through trees,
a gentle trickling stream, a campfire crackling, logs laid
out for sitting, a kettle boiling
JAY sits on a log
SILAS approaches him while sharpening a large hunting knife
SILAS walks behind JAY holding the knife up
SILAS
The knife's got to be as sharp as a
razor
JAY's face has been lathered up with soap, the irony is JAY
is still too young for even the hint of stubble
SILAS (CONT’D)
You hold the knife flush, against
the skin
SILAS holds the knife flush against JAY's throat

33.
SILAS (CONT’D)
And it's a scraping motion against
the grain, not a slicing motion
SILAS scrapes the knife up the side of JAYS face and wipes
the soap on a cloth over his shoulder
SILAS (CONT’D)
Like so.. We gotta make you
presentable for her
JAY smiles at this
JAY
I know why you need my help
SILAS pauses..
Oh yeah?

SILAS

JAY
Yeah - You’re lonely. You’re a
lonely man
The truth throws SILAS for a beat
Sure kid

SILAS

JAY
Sure kid. Lets drift. The silent,
lonely drifter
SILAS continues to shave JAY
JAY (CONT’D)
You’re a lonely, lonely man
SILAS
No need to concern over me
SILAS places the blade on JAY
JAY flinches
Hold still

SILAS (CONT’D)

JAY
All I’m saying is.. There's more to
life than just surviving
SILAS
Yeah - there's dyin’. Survival
ain't jus’ how to skin a jackrabbit.
(MORE)

34.
SILAS (CONT'D)
It's knowing when to bluster and
when to hush. When to take a
beatin’ and when to strike
JAY
Where's your folks?
SILAS
Father's in the ground in Ireland,
Mother's in the ground in Canada
JAY
So what keeps you from joining
them?
SILAS snaps
SILAS
I dunno kid, quit askin’ me shit
JAY smiles
SILAS (CONT’D)
I was fine ‘til you showed up
JAY
I showed up? You showed up
SILAS
Yeah well maybe I’m tired of
showin’ up
A distant noise like tinkling of glasses..
SILAS stops shaving JAY, half finished, and looks to the
trees, brings out his gun and cocks it
SILAS (CONT’D)
You’re done
SILAS slowly walks across camp towards the noise, gun pointed
A man wanders into view - PAYNE - we remember him as the
leader of the posse watching JAY and SILAS ride days back
We especially remember because PAYNE wears an enormous fur
coat
PAYNE is a generation older than SILAS and a generation
wilder
PAYNE chomps on a cigar, (bigger than SILAS’s cigar) carries
a couple of glasses in one hand (source of the clinking) and
a bottle of absinthe in the other
PAYNE pauses for dramatic effect, unbothered by Silas and his
gun

35.
PAYNE holds his hands out wide as he does a balletic turn
walking into the middle of the camp
Another dramatic pause, removes cigar
PAYNE
May I enter?
SILAS
It's a free country
PAYNE
Try telling the natives that
PAYNE playful, SILAS wary, JAY entertained
PAYNE (CONT’D)
I propose a trade. A mug of coffee
for the finest imported absinthe
and a cigar of unrivaled quality..
JAY
We drink tea
PAYNE ignores JAY
PAYNE pulls out a couple of cigars from his belt, hands one
to SILAS and one to JAY
PAYNE
One for you, young man
PAYNE, SILAS, JAY, all move to the logs by the fie and sit in
a triangle
PAYNE pours three glasses of absinthe as he checks SILAS out
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Still not a mark on you
JAY confused
JAY
You know him ?
SILAS smiles
SILAS
Fuck yourself Payne
PAYNE smiles
PAYNE
I’ve tried.. Believe me I have
tried
PAYNE takes a swig of the tea JAY has poured him

36.
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Oh.. That's damn fine coffee
It's tea

JAY

PAYNE passes an absinthe to SILAS, and to JAY, stands and
toasts
PAYNE
To bad times in the green hour
SILAS downs, JAY sips
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Down it boy, it's liquid joy
PAYNE casually to JAY
PAYNE (CONT’D)
So you headed West ?
SILAS interrupts quick before JAY can answer
North

SILAS

They are all lying to each other and they all know it
PAYNE
Yeah, I’m headed .. South! The
chill. I can’t stand it - Makes my
joints ache
PAYNE moves his finger like he's pulling an invisible trigger
and makes a threatening squeaky sound, moving in close to
JAY, and re-fills his glass
PAYNE (CONT’D)
So why north kid ? Someone special?
You’re sweetheart maybe ?
Now SILAS moves in close and gives JAY the ‘don’t answer’
stare
PAYNE breaks the tension
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Hey.. I’m teasing, I’m teasing. You
must be born on a Sunday, eh? You
born on a Sunday?
JAY just shakes his head
PAYNE (CONT’D)
You born on a Sunday?

37.
JAY
I don’t know
SILAS now very alert to PAYNE's line of questioning
PAYNE
So it's fortunate that you’re
headed North because West, it's
bad, big trouble, big storm coming
SILAS decides to cut this quick
SILAS
Easy Payne. He's just a kid
PAYNE
No, he's not. He's an outlaw, just
like us
This saddens SILAS but pleases JAY
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Any-hoo! Let's drink. To friends,
old.. And new
They all down another absinthe, but SILAS and JAY have drunk
way more than PAYNE
PAYNE made sure of that
CUT TO:

EXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT

An empty bottle of Absinthe on its side - lit by the moon
PAYNE sits on a log watching SILAS and JAY
SILAS is showing JAY how to draw and cock his gun quickly,
and SILAS, half-cut, is still pretty handy
SILAS shows JAY how to spin his gun round his finger
Spin it!

SILAS

JAY tries to copy but drops the gun
The nozzle lands and sticks in the dirt
SILAS (CONT’D)
That's pretty good
A swaying JAY leans down and picks up the gun, the nozzle now
packed with mud

38.
SILAS (CONT’D)
Get that dirt out of it.. Clean it
JAY tries to clean it with his cuff then looks directly down
the barrel of the gun
JAY stumbles over to a tree and taps the gun against the
trunk
The gun goes of with a loud bang and JAY drops it and falls
over
This amuses SILAS greatly and he celebrates by firing his own
gun into the air
PAYNE is sitting back against a tree, his face in shadow,
watching JAY and SILAS unravel
PAYNE shakes his head
The plan to get SILAS and JAY drunk and talking is failing,
now they are too drunk
JAY
I need to piss
SILAS flaps his gun in the direction of the forest (same path
as PAYNE came from top of scene)
SILAS
Away from camp!
JAY wanders into the dark
PAYNE waits a beat until JAY has gone
Stares at SILAS
PAYNE
Easy see how you two crossed paths.
One's a falling angel, the other's
a rising devil
PAYNE walks towards SILAS
SILAS staggers towards PAYNE
SILAS
I’m no angel
As SILAS tries to step over a log, catches his foot and falls
hard to the ground with a thump
True

PAYNE

PAYNE helps SILAS to his feet

39.
The men embrace
SILAS using PAYNE to balance, PAYNE holding SILAS close
PAYNE (CONT’D)
You think that's a smart play teaming up with him - quicker than
trackin’ him - simpler
SILAS
Ain’t no play about it
PAYNE
Yeah, I guess if you knew where
Rose and daddy was, you’d be done
babysittin’
SILAS stays quiet
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Never was a bean-spiller was ya?
Not sober, nor liquored up, never
was
SILAS stays quiet, the men still holding each other close
PAYNE (CONT’D)
What you gonna do with two thousand
dollars?
PAYNE places both hands on SILAS’ shoulders
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Come back to us
SILAS loses patience, pulls out his gun, cocks it and pushes
the nozzle into PAYNE's belly
SILAS
I’m not like you Payne
PAYNE get's it, takes a step back, and another, and another
and keeps walking backwards into the darkness

He trips and stumbles into the camp then freezes and looks
about
A group of ten folk sit round the fire. JAY recognises none
of them
(We recognise this posse. They are PAYNE's posse from the
ridge)
They all look up at JAY
THE KID, SKELLY, PEYOTE JOE, THE MINSTREL, TATTOO MAN
MARIMACHO with the TWO SWEDISH KIDS from the trading post
THE KID stands up, knife in hand itching to leap on JAY and
cut him up
JAY
What have ye done with SILAS and
PAYNE?
Sitting next to THE KID, SKELLY, oldest of the gang and 2nd
in charge after PAYNE
Nudges THE KID
SKELLY
Back down kid, Payne needs him
alive, you’ll get your chance
THE KID reluctantly obeys and sits back down in a huff
JAY confused, not realising he's wandered the wrong way and
entered the wrong camp
JAY
What have you done with the river?
PEYOTE JOE, bulging crazy eyes from way too much Peyote,
answers JAY with an ominous tone
PEYOTE JOE
They took it
JAY sits down in the circle of folk, between TATTOO MAN and
PEYOTE JOE
The SWEDISH GIRL watches him, recognising him from the
trading post
JAY doesn't recognise her
JAY turns to PEYOTE JOE

JAY
Who took it?
PEYOTE JOE
Didn’t see their faces
MARIMACHO sees the SWEDISH GIRL stare at JAY
Kid!

MARIMACHO

The SWEDISH GIRL breaks her stare and obeys MARIMACHO,
crawling under a blanket with her brother
MARIMACHO tucks them in
SKELLY, sitting next to THE KID on the opposite side of the
fire to JAY, continues a conversation
SKELLY
All I’m sayin’ is in my day we
tried to keep out o’ the papers.
You youngsters tryin’ to get in em
makes no sense
THE KID
And all I’m sayin’, Skell, is I
want folks to respec’ me. What's
the point in dyin’ if nobody knows
you dead. Same goes for killin’
SKELLY spits a gob of chewed tobacco into the fire and looks
around at his audience and clears his throat
SKELLY
I partnered with a youngling once
upon a time, by the name of Bill
Allson. Dying to be famous,
actually, killing to be famous.
Come to me one time and he said..

The men walk and talk
(SKELLY is still telling the story but the characters mouth
the words)

BILL ALLSON (SKELLY'S V.O.)
“I killed thirty men and countless
savages, and I still ain’t got me
no wanted poster”
SKELLY (SARCASTIC)
Where's the justice in that? I says
Its a one horse town and it looks deserted, dream-like
The men approach a makeshift wooden shack, operating as the
town saloon
SKELLY (V.O.)
So I’m thinking, the only way to
stop this kid croakin’ more
innocents is to draw up a poster.
Let him find it
A hand draws a wanted poster - BILL ALLISON, WANTED ~$500
DEAD OR ALIVE, its a crude poster, badly drawn

SKELLY hammers up the wanted poster on the outside wall of

A basic wooden room, walls pain'ted white, a table and chair

Two windows on the wall behind ROSE , but instead of glass,
paper, semi-transparent oiled paper
Slowly and theatrically lights fade up from outside, glowing
through paper windows
JAY is slumped against the opposite wall. Rose does not see
him, JAY is the sole audience to this strange ‘play’
He smiles as he sees ROSE
A distant crack of thunder and SILAS enters the room from a
door on the right, smiles at Rose
JAY stops smiling, looks confused, then upset
SILAS sits at the table with ROSE and starts to read a

ROSE gets up and approaches JAY (POV CAMERA), leans in and

Thunder crashes, lightning is flashes, heavy rain falls in

This is the storm SILAS and JAY are in, and it looks about a

The plain, on the other hand, is backing hot, clear blue

A house sits in the middle of the plain, freshly built,
bright yellow pine, oiled paper, not glass, on the window
JOHN ROSS stands on the porch of the house he has just built
JOHN looks at the distant storm and shakes his head - he
needs the storm to be here, to water his crops
He turns to watch a figure walk slowly towards him across the
plain
This is KOTORI, a young, handsome Native American, dressed in
'settler’ shirt and trousers
KOTORI carries two large jack rabbits, has a rifle over his
shoulder, holds up the rabbits
JOHN nods and smiles

The Ross house is simply constructed, whitewashed wood
walls, paper windows, we may recognise the room from JAY's
dream during the flood
Now it is furnished - simple furniture mad from pine- a
dresser, a table, chairs, a bed
The dresser has plates, apples, bottles of milk, glasses
There is also a milk churn, other objects of use for daily
life far from any store
There is a rifle on two nails above the door, a single bed in
the far corner (John's), a door leading to a tiny room where
Rose sleeps - and in the back a small larder full of food and
utensils, and a back door
ROSE is now dressed in trousers and shirt, more practical,
making her look more grown up, her platted hair makes her
more ‘American’

ROSE ROSS picks up a butter mould and carries it across the
room
She pauses mid stride as she hears KOTORI approach - she is
very alert
KOTORI enters, ROSE smiles
Kotori

She takes the jackrabbits from him and hangs them up on a
nail in the back larder
JOHN enters and sits down at the table with KOTORI
ROSE pours her father a cup of coffee
JOHN ROSS (SARCASTIC)
Turned out nice again
ROSE turns
Coffee!

KOTORI

ROSE turns back and pours Kotori a coffee
ROSE
You always ask for coffee and you

ROSE slowly lifts the top of the butter mould, but the butter
has not set and sinks out in a yellow splodge onto the table

PAYNE and his gang appear on the lip of the ridge and stop,
looking down the hill
They are about 500 yards behind JAY and SILAS, who have
dismounted and are at the bottom of the hill
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
I must have been Jay's age when I
joined Payne's gang
PAYNE’s gang watch as SILAS and JAY stop at the edge of a
forest at the bottom of the hill
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
Those were prosperous times in our
trade. When I split, I was lucky to
do so with my life
This forest is Silverghost, the forest JAY paid SILAS to get
him too, so they must be close to ROSE now
In fact on the far side of the forest is a plain and on the
plain sits a house and in that house ROSE, JOHN and KOTORI
SILAS turns and looks back up the hill, his fears confirmed
when he sees PAYNE and his posse at the top of the hill
JAY turns to see the posse
JAY
What do they want?
SILAS
They’re bounty hunters. You know
what that means?
JAY
They hunt bounty?
SILAS rummages in his saddlebag and pulls out the wanted
poster
SILAS
They hunt Rose. Daddy. Blood. Money
SILAS passes JAY the poster, now sodden from the flood and
breaking apart
JAY takes a long hard look at the drawing of ROSE and at the
words DEAD or ALIVE
JAY
Wanted .. Dead or ..
SILAS
Dead or dead, kid

SILAS thinks about striking JAY but changes his mind
He mounts his horse, looking into the forest
Silverghost is a silver birch forest, white trees and green
leaves make it look inviting

Local tribes call this forest ‘the
place of spirit trees’, trappers
call it ‘Silverghost’ - Legend has

JAY and SILAS are still in their long johns and have
forgotten about the washing line - their clothes now dragging
along the ground
JAY

terror of night, nor for the arrow

SILAS, now back in dry trousers, picks up his shirt from the
washing line rope and shakes the leaves from it. We see the
rope still ties the two horses together
JAY thinks he sees something move in the trees
He wanders into the middle of the clearing
A superbly camouflaged figure in between the trees pulls back
the string of a bow
JAY sees the movement but not the figure
JAY
Silas .. The trees are moving
SILAS turns to look but sees nothing

SILAS
It’s called a hangover kid. You’ll
get used to it
The figure, a NATIVE AMERICAN, is painted to look like a
silver birch tree
His bow is drawn and his arrow points at JAY
His tribe must be the reason why ‘men come in to Silverghost
don’t come out’
The arrow is released with a whizz
JAY instinctively raises his hands to cover his face
The arrow shoots right through the palm of JAY’s hand and
stops an inch before his forehead
JAY holds up his hand with the arrow stuck clean through it.
First disbelief, then panic, then pain
SILAS wanders over
Behind SILAS and JAY, TWO MORE NATIVES dart from the trees
and leap on their horses, and gallop past SILAS and JAY
SILAS and JAY can only watch
The washing line rope is still tied between the horses and
drags along the ground
The NATIVES pass each side of a tree, the rope snaps tight
around the base of the trunk, bringing the horses to an
abrupt stop and trowing the natives into the air
One lands with a roll and runs off in disbelief, the other
smacks into a tree and lands with a thud and is knocked out
cold
SILAS and JAY can’t quite believe what they’ve seen, saved by
the rope..
The NATIVE who fired the arrow at JAY cannot believe it
either, not seeing the rope and thinking magic involved, he
drops his bow and arrow and runs off into the forest
JAY grabs SILAS, the arrow in the hand still a slight issue
SILAS smiles
Nice catch

In the middle stands a ragged scarecrow
At the back of the wheatfield, crouched low, facing the house
is VICTOR THE HAWK
He opens the long case (SILAS noted at the trading post) and
in it a long rifle, snug in red velvet, and a neat row of
bullets
This rifle has a sight attached for distance shooting
VICTOR gently lifts the rifle up and looks across the field
About fifty yards to the left of the house JOHN ROSS is
building a fence
Two posts are up and JOHN ROSS is nailing up a cross spar
VICTOR places a bullet in the chamber of the rifle
JOHN ROSS lifts the long piece of wood up and hammers in a
nail, fixing the spar a post
The sun is beating down hard
VICTOR gages the distance between himself and JOHN ROSS while
adjusting the sights and aiming
JOHN ROSS, sweating, removes his hat and stares up at the sun
VICTOR is about to pull the trigger, until a sound of the
house door opening stops him
ROSE and KOTORI appear and run about fifty yards to the right

line with sheets flapping in the breeze, and a pony tied to a

In the distance a house, a washing line, a wheatfield, too
far to see people, but it is the Ross house, and ROSE is
riding, and JOHN ROSS is mending the fence and VICTOR is
crouched at the back of the field, but from JAY’s view it

JAY ignores SILAS and lets out a relieved sigh
JAY
Exactly what I imagined
As JAY looks towards the house, SILAS dismounts, unhooks the
rope from the saddle and walks towards JAY
SILAS has made a small loop in the end of the rope and he
loops it over JAYS hand, pulls the loop tight and grabs JAY
by the scruff of his neck
Hey

SILAS drags JAY backwards, JAY struggling, falls to the
ground, and is dragged along the ground on his back
JAY (CONT’D)
Silas! Silas, SILAS, what are you
doing.. Stop, no.. Silas!
SILAS hauls JAY up against the nearest silver birch tree on
the edge of the plain, moves behind JAY and passes the rope
around the trunk, and ties his hands together
JAY is sitting, his back up against the trunk, wriggling and
spitting with rage
SILAS, behind JAY, pulls out his large hunting knife
JAY sees the knife, stops wriggling, places his head against
the tree, shuts his eyes

him dead

ROSE turns, throws the rifle down and picks up her pistol,
moves up and looks out of the window, sees KOTORI lying dead
Kotori

ROSE

ROSE slumps back down below the window, this time facing JAY
The smoke from the burning field clears giving ROSE a clear
view of JAY
She looks directly at JAY for the first time
JAY tries to speak
Rose

JAY (WHISPER)

ROSE sees JAY
Jay

ROSE

JAY sheds a single tear
ROSE, still with pistol in her hand, crosses the room towards
JAY on her hands and knees
JAY smiles at ROSE and places his hand on hers

72.
ROSE begins to softly cry
Jay

ROSE (CONT’D)

ROSE holds JAY’s hand and tries to smile through the grief
Silly boy

ROSE (CONT’D)

JAY tries to talk but cannot
Light has been streaming through the front door, but it turns
to shadow, darkening the whole room
ROSE turns to look
PAYNE stands at the door
ROSE realises that PAYNE cannot see her gun from his line of
sight
ROSE slowly cocks the gun as PAYNE talks
PAYNE
Turn around Rose
ROSE turns the gun around and places it in JAY’s hand
It’s over

PAYNE (CONT’D)

ROSE leans in to kiss JAY on the cheek, giving JAY a clear
view of PAYNE
PAYNE lifts his gun to ROSE
PAYNE (CONT’D)
Doesn’t hurt
Before PAYNE can pull the trigger, JAY fires and PAYNE falls
to his knees
PAYNE falls forward onto his hands and rolls onto his back,
dead
JAY shuts his eyes and lets out his last gentle breath and
dies
ROSE sobs and lowers her head

ROSE sits in front of JAY
SILAS hobbles in through the front door, and sees JAY lying
dead
Jay

SILAS

SILAS slumps down on his knees next to ROSE
They both look at JAY and not at each other
SILAS removes his hat
SILAS (CONT’D)
He loved you with all his heart
ROSE
His heart was in the wrong place
SILAS
His spirit was true
JAY dead, we hold him for a beat
PAYNE dead and we hold on him for a beat
This is a quiet tableau vivant style montage of all the
people that died on JAY’S journey to ROSE
SKELLY lies dead in the wheat field, blackened, burnt to a
crisp
MARIMACHO lies dead on the grass
THE MINSTREL lies dead next to his banjo which now has a
bullet hole in the skin
KOTORI lies dead on the grass next to his bow and arrows
THE KID lies dead next to the house
PEYOTE JOE lies dead at the back door, his hand still frozen
to the door handle, his trousers pulled down snagged on the
nail
TATTOO MAN lies dead below the front window, the snail train
of dried blood on the wood
VICTOR the HAWK lies dead in the wheat field next to his long
case and long gun
JOHN ROSS lies dead by the fence
MARIA THE SWEDE lies dead in the trading post

74.
JOHAN lies dead in a pool of blood in the trading post
THE STOREKEEPER lies dead behind the counter in the trading
post
The Indian slaying old OFFICER lies dead on the forest floor
The two young Indian slaying SOLDIERS lie dead on the forest
floor
End of montage of the dead

EXT - PLAIN WITH PIONEER HOUSE SITTING PRETTY IN THE SUN 102
Slow track towards a double bed inside the pioneer house,
where there was a single bed before
Slow track towards the kitchen table - ROSE brings the butter
mold to the table, as the two SWEDISH KIDS (from the trading
post, then Payne’s gang) play by the table
ROSE lifts the lid of the butter, but it still has not set
and flows onto the table
Slow track towards the horse shoe that JOHN ROSS nailed above
the door, that was then shot and fell upside down
A man’s hands appear, turn the horseshoe and hammers a nail
in to hold it ‘lucky way up’
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
There is more to life than
survival. Jay Cavendish taught me
that. I owe him my life
We track back to see it is SILAS nailing up the horse shoe
SILAS SELLECK (V.O.)
Ho for the West
SILAS turns, exits frame, black screen
