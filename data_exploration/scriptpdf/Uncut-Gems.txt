EXT. OPAL MINE - ETHIOPIA - DAY
Unrest. White foremen violently argue via translators with a
group of local black miners. A fist fight breaks out and quickly
grows into a riot. Two MEN, both black, take advantage of the
chaos to sneak inside the mine.
INT. OPAL MINE - ETHIOPIA - CONTINUOUS
The MEN don head lamps and plunge into the darkness of the mine.
The sound of the riot quickly recedes behind them, overtaken by
their own heavy, echoed breaths. They stop at a ragged t-shirt
stuck in a crevice in a wall.
MAN 1 keeps look-out as MAN 2 pulls the t-shirt out and uses a
screw driver to dislodge a large clump of dirt from the crevice.
MAN 2 crumbles the dirt away, exposing a rock the size of a
grapefruit. Using an electric grinding sander, he exposes small
‘windows’ on either side of the rock and holds it up to a light
for inspection.
Twinkling electronic music fades in as the camera moves into the
gem. Light and color engulf the frame in a shifting melange of
abstract shapes and patterns.
UNCUT GEMS
A1

CREDITS accompany our psychedelic journey through the inside
A1 of
the gem. A metallic shimmer appears in the distance, as we near
it, we see that it’s a boxing gym bell.
INT. UNIVERSAL BOXING GYM, QUEENS, NY - RING -NIGHT
DING DING DING. NADAV, late 20’s, dim, strong, with a unibrow,
meets a YOUNG LATINO boxer center ring. NADAV is instantly hit 3
times in the head. He endures. Ringside, ARTHUR, 30s, black,
yells excitedly.
INT. UNIVERSAL BOXING GYM, QUEENS, NY - LOCKERROOM - AFTER
NADAV, naked, changes in front of his locker. ARTHUR enters.
ARTHUR
Me and Dev are gonna hit up Glazz
tonight. Tons of girls, come with.
NADAV
Alright, just gotta go home first.
I’m around the corner.
My nigga!

ARTHUR

2.
INT. NADAV’S APARTMENT, SUNNYSIDE QUEENS - BEDROOM - AFTER
NADAV applies gel and cologne to his body, while ARTHUR watches
from the bed. Hanging off the mirror are a dozen gold chains.
NADAV grabs one with a star of David pendant and clasps it
around his neck. Reaching into his underwear drawer, he pulls
out and adorns a gold Rolex watch. ARTHUR takes note.
ARTHUR
You mind if I smoke?
NADAV
Nah, just do it by the window.
ARTHUR walks over to the window, opens it and lights up.
INT. GLAZZ NIGHT CLUB - AFTER
At the bar, ARTHUR and DEV, also black, flirt with girls, NADAV
clings on. NADAV is one of a few white people in the club.
INT. NADAV’S APARTMENT, BUILDING HALLWAY - 12AM
NADAV, drunk, walks down his hallway, unlocks his apartment.
INT. NADAV’S APARTMENT - AFTER
The apartment has been ransacked. The bed has been turned over,
the drawers from his dresser pulled out and emptied, mirror
broken, TV and stereo clearly missing. NADAV panics.
NADAV
No, no, no, no...
NADAV searches the dresser area for his jewelry.
NADAV (CONT’D)
Mother fucker!
He bursts into tears, howls, throws the dresser over and then
fumbles for his phone. He dials.
NADAV (CONT’D)
COME ON, COME ON... HOWARD! PLEASE
HOWARD PICK UP!
INT. NADAV’S APARTMENT, SUNNYSIDE QUEENS - AFTER
BUZZZZZ! NADAV opens the door. The hallway lights halo HOWARD
NAGY, a heavyset, hardened yet handsome, early 50’s, oliveskinned Sephardic Jew with a thick mediterranean accent. NADAV
is immediately comforted by his presence.
HOWARD
What happened?

3.
NADAV
They took my mom’s jewelry! My
stereo, TV, the nice speakers. My
chains, shit hidden in my drawers.
HOWARD
One thing at a time.
NADAV
THEY TOOK MOM’S JEWLERY, they just
took the whole box! They touched
everything, put their hands on all
my stuff! Look at my bed!
HOWARD looks around the apartment and an open window.
HOWARD
Nadav, did you leave your window
open like that?
NADAV
What do you mean?
HOWARD
What are you a fuckin’ moron?!
NADAV
Shit! Arthur must’ve forgotten to
close it.
HOWARD
Who’s Arthur?
NADAV
He’s my friend from the gym, he
wanted to have a cigarette so I
told him by the window.
HOWARD
How long have you known Arthur?
NADAV
Few months.
HOWARD
He black or white?
Black.

NADAV

HOWARD
He been here before?
NADAV
No, tonight was the first time. He
said let’s go get pussy and I told
him I needed to change first.

4.
HOWARD
Where’d you go with him?
To Glazz.

NADAV

HOWARD
What is that?
NADAV
A night club.
HOWARD sees the Rolex around his wrist.
HOWARD
You put that on in front of him?
What?

NADAV

HOWARD
That watch, did you put that on in
front of him?
NADAV
Uh...yeah...
HOWARD
You flaunt that shit in front of a
schwartza?
Arthur?

NADAV

HOWARD
Arthur left the window open on
purpose dumdum. Probably texted
some of his boys that you had
jewelry and shit laying around,
clearly you have a rolex, right?
NADAV
(grows angry)
He fucking robbed me!?!
HOWARD
His friends. He left the window
open for them.
NADAV erupts. Starts punching the wall really hard. Screaming
expletives at ARTHUR.
NADAV
THAT MOTHER FUCKER!!
HOWARD lets him blow off some steam. NADAV is out of control.
HOWARD
NADAV, ENOUGH!

5.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(much calmer)
Ok, what did they take?
NADAV
I told you, all the jewelry, the
necklace you got me and everything.
HOWARD
I’ll give you another necklace.
What else?
NADAV
My TV, the stereo, all the
electronic stuff, my i-Pod...
HOWARD
We can get you a new i-pod.
NADAV
...The extra phones you gave me, my
boxing beeper thing, cd’s- oh shit,
DAD!
NADAV suddenly panics, runs to the bed and moves it out of the
way. He pulls up the carpet and using a metal shim, pries open a
floor board. Underneath sits a plastic Duane Reade bag.
NADAV (CONT’D)
(crying)
Thank god! Oh thank fucking god!
HOWARD
What is that? Cash?
HOWARD opens the bag and sees bundles of cash.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Josef gave this to you?
NADAV
Yeah, he left it to me.
HOWARD
How much is in here?
NADAV
All of it, about 235 thousand
dollars. I never touched a penny.
HOWARD laughs.
HOWARD
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
NADAV
He told me not to declare it.

6.
HOWARD
So you decided to keep it on the
floor?
NADAV
He said don’t declare it.
HOWARD’S phone vibrates loudly. He immediately silences it.
HOWARD
I understand that but he didn’t
expect you to live like a pig. He
expected you to spend it, live
nicely put the money somewhere
untouchable.
NADAV
They didn’t find it!
HOWARD
I just can’t believe that all these
years-You’re telling me you had
this money for the past 8 years?
Yeah.

NADAV

HOWARD
Do you know what a moron you are?
What an unbelievable moron you are.
NADAV just stares at him. HOWARD softens a little.
HOWARD’s phone rings again. This time, he pulls it from his
pocket, see’s “GABI” and silences it again.
NADAV
You’re right, it’s not safe here.
HOWARD
Give it to me and I’ll take care of
it, I’ll put it in a safe-deposit
box for you tomorrow.
HOWARD’S phone vibrates again, silences it. Again, sees “GABI.”
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(distracted)
That’s your inheritance... you
don’t keep your inheritance under a
bed like that. You deserve what
happened to you acting like such an
idiot around people you don’t know.
NADAV
No, I know, I... I’m sorry...
NADAV hands the Duane Reade Bag to HOWARD. HOWARD’s phone
vibrates again, he pulls it out.

7.
HOWARD
Alright! Alright.
Answers phone.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Enough! I told you I’m on my way...
Yes! FOR THE 100TH TIME YES!
GABI (O.S.)
Don’t you dare give me lip!
A woman is heard yelling in the background of the call.
CARMELLE (O.S.)
You fuckin’ piece of shit lowlife...
HOWARD
Carmelle, Carmelle! Will you hold
on a second?
(to NADAV)
NADAV, I gotta run.
HOWARD takes 40$ out from his pocket, gives it to NADAV.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Take this money and grab a cab and
go stay at the house tonight, you
can clean all this stuff up
tomorrow.
HOWARD kisses NADAV on the forehead, rushes out of the
apartment, BAG in hand, and on the phone.
NADAV
Thank you Howard!
You there?

GABI (O.S.)

EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - 2 AM
A CAB pulls up to the departures entrance at LaGuardia Airport.
HOWARD pays the driver with bills from the Duane Reade bag and
rushes into the terminal.
INT. MIAMI HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - 6 AM
HOWARD rushes down an exterior hallway. On his left are
apartment doors, on his right a sweeping view of South Beach
Miami. He stops at a door, takes a moment to collect himself and
rings the bell. Pause. The door is opened by CARMELLE NAGY,
Howard’s sister-in-law, 55, tight shiny skin, wearing a
nightgown. She bursts into rage.

8.
CARMELLE
Oh! Look at this! Look at this!
HOWARD
Carmelle. PleaseCARMELLE
No! No! You! You look at this.
CARMELLE grabs HOWARD by the wrist and jerks him into the
apartment, gesticulating wildly with her other hand.
INT. GABI NAGY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD looks around an empty room. The only visible furniture:
two crappy metal folding chairs and a card table.
LOUSIE
We come back from Puerto Rico and
this!
HOWARD
I know, I know. Listen to meCARMELLE grabs a printed note from the card table and violently
shoves it in HOWARD’s face.
LOUSIE
A $17,000 Rue de Saint Claude Gold
sofa set!
HOWARD pushes her hand away and makes a beeline for the
bathroom.
Hey! Hey!

LOUSIE (CONT’D)

Ignoring her, HOWARD opens the door to the bathroom and enters.
INT. GABI NAGY’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD closes the door on CARMELLE’s face and locks it. A
constant stream of invectives is audible from the other side of
the door. The room is filled with steam.
An extremely disoriented man, GABI, 57, naked, shouts from
behind the shower curtain.
GABI
I’m in the shower! I’m in the
shower!
HOWARD
GABI, all I’m asking is for 30
seconds to hear me out.

9.
Get out!

GABI

HOWARD
All you have to do is listenGABI
I’m in the fuckin’ shower Howard!
HOWARD
GABI. Ok... I’m having some
problems. The fact that any of it
has affected you negativelyCARMELLE (0.S)
We should’ve taken your name off
this place YEARS AGO!!!
HOWARD
(to door)
CARMELLE, I’M SORRY!
(to GABI)
We’ll change the title asap.
GABI opens the curtain and shoves his finger at HOWARD.
GABI
I DON’T WANNA HEAR IT!
GABI steps out of the shower. Grabs a towel.
HOWARD
You don’t want to hear how you
could profit from this?
GABI lunges at HOWARD, pushing him against a wall of pink tile.
HOWARD reluctantly retaliates and within seconds has GABI in a
headlock.
CARMELLE (O.S.)
Open this god damn door!
HOWARD
(calmly)
30 seconds.
Fuck you!

GABI

HOWARD tightens the headlock. CARMELLE escalates to a constant
muffled wall of noise.
Ok.

HOWARD

(raising his voice)
CARMELLE, I’M TALKING NOW!
CARMELLE quiets down.

10.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(slowly, deliberately)
CLEARLY, I’M HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.
THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD AFFECT
THE TWO OF YOU NEGATIVELY IN ANY
WAY MAKES ME SICK. THAT’S WHY I’M
HERE, IT’S WHY I BROUGHT MONEY, I
BROUGHT YOU 50 GRAND... FOR YOUR
PROBLEMS. I HAVE ANOTHER 190
THOUSAND HERE THAT WILL TAKE CARE
OF ALL OF THIS... BUT THIS ISN’T AS
BAD AS IT LOOKS. EVERYONE IS FINE.
HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO DO...
YOU’RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH AN
INSURANCE CLAIM, COLLECT WHAT
YOU’RE OWED. I’M GONNA PUT THIS
MONEY INTO AN ACCOUNT FOR THEM
TODAY, IN A FEW HOURS, ONCE THAT’S
DONE...
(readjusts self)
THEY’LL LET US KNOW WHERE YOUR
STUFF IS BEING STORED AND NEITHER
OF YOU WILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A
THING. JOANI WILL HAVE MOVERS BRING
YOUR STUFF BACK HERE AND I’LL
PERSONALLY COME BACK AND REARRANGE
IT TO THE WAY IT WAS.
(relaxes, slightly)
PLUS I GOT A STONE COMING THROUGH
THIS WEEK, IT’LL TAKE CARE OF
EVERYONE, TRUST ME. I CAN HIT YOU
OFF WITH SOME MORE CASH-DID THEY
GET TO YOUR SAFE?
Reluctantly, GABI shakes his head “No.”
HOWARD (CONT’D)
WELL, THEN LET’S EMPTY IT AND MAKE
THAT CLAIM.
GABI is not amused.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
SOON IT WILL BE LIKE NOTHING EVER
HAPPENED AND YOU’LL BE RICHER FOR
IT!
CARMELLE (O.S.)
And what, we’re supposed to eat on
the floor for the next 2 months!?!
HOWARD
Not 2 months, I’m talking a few
days. I’ll put you guys up at my
expense at the Spa hotel in South
Beach till your stuff is back.
CARMELLE
I hate that hotel! Our friends are
here Howard!

11.
HOWARD
Ok, a local hotel then! I was
trying to make it nice!
(to GABI)
I’m gonna let go now.
HOWARD lets go. Slowly, inscrutably, GABI slides away. With his
back turned to HOWARD, and breathing heavily, he begins to dry
his body.
Gabi?

HOWARD (CONT’D)

A long pause. GABI doesn’t turn around.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Are you mad?
EXT. MIAMI STREET, NEAR BEACH. 7 AM
HOWARD walks with fervor, on the phone. He smokes a cigarette.
HOWARD
(into phone)
Jim... Jim... You gotta understand,
I was in a really shitty place I’m
in- You think I, me, Howard NAGY,
wouldn’t pay... When have I ever
failed to pay what I owe... Well,
that was a ridiculous situation and
it wasn’t my money to pay back...
Ok then in this case you win, my
brother won’t talk to me and his
wife is gonna kill me... Ok, the
second the bank opens down hereI’ll be at Chase before the managerI have cash on me, I can put 175
grand into those accounts for you(long listen)
You’ll have the funds by 9, 10,
11am... I just need them to open
and then- BOOM- you’ve got your
money... So I can tell Gabi you’ll
have his shit back to him by the
tomorrow... Ok, by Friday?
HOWARD listens and turns onto the beach.
EXT. BEACH, SOUTH BEACH MIAMI - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD, barely listening, puts his phone on speaker so he can
open up his browser to check an online sports betting site.

12.
JIM (O.S.)
(via speakerphone)
-That cock-sucker what he did
wasn’t okay, and it put a real
strain on everyone, screaming all
that shit, and I don’t think this,
but everyone knows that he was your
guy, your rec and I know it’s not
always guilty by association but
you were associated and now this,
it’s not cool, you put me in a
place that I don’t want to be put
in, I’m in a spot, you know that?
How long I know you?
HOWARD
A long time.
JIM (0.S)
A long time. I don’t know many
people a long time. But it doesn’t
mean a thing if you play with my
money like that. Ok? Not again. My
partners aren’t as nice as I am.
I’m a nice guy, you know that.
HOWARD zooms in on spreads to potential bets.
HOWARD
The nicest guy in the business! I
tell everyone that.
JIM (O.S.)
(sardonically)
Don’t do that.
HOWARD sees a few betting lines that excite him.
HOWARD
Wow... Ok, okay, once the money
clears can I place a few bets with
you, I wanna do a 4 team parlayJIM tries to interrupt HOWARD.
Howar-

JIM

HOWARD
2 dimes on the Knicks to cover the over on the half there- what’s
the spread on the Hawks/Thunder
gameJIM (O.S.)
-ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NO. I WON’T
TAKE ANYTHING TILL YOU’RE ALL
SQUARED UP. NO ONE’S TAKING SHIT
FROM YOU, STOP, WHILE-

13.
HOWARD disengages speakerphone. Brings phone up to ear.
HOWARD
JIM.. Jim.. Jim! I’m on a beach! My
phone’s gonna die, don’t do this!
I’m holding 175k of your money in a
bag right now. I swear to G-d...
JIM... Jim- Yeah- Don’t letPhone dies.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to self)
Mother Fucker.
An early morning JOGGER runs by the ocean with his dog. HOWARD
hunches over and plays with it like a little kid. HOWARD falls
to the ground, the dog licks his face all over.
INT. AIRPLANE. DAYTIME, 30,000 FEET.
HOWARD sits in first class at a window seat drinking a Coke
zero. He compulsively rips pages of luxury items out of an issue
of SkyMall Magazine and puts them in his pocket.
INT. MIRAGE CASINO, LAS VEAGAS. CHIP EXCHANGE - DAYTIME
HOWARD removes money from the DUANE READE BAG and places it on
the teller’s counter.
HOWARD
Gimme them in $500 chips.
The TELLER runs the cash through a money counter. Slow zoom into
the digital counter.
MONTAGE: HOWARD gambles at the crap tables, roulette, poker...
making money hand over fist. He looks manic.
INT. MIRAGE CASINO, LAS VEAGAS. SPORTS BOOK - AFTER
HOWARD stands at a teller’s window. Flat-screen TV’s fill the
room displaying games, scores, stats and betting lines.
HOWARD
I want 60 grand on the following
parlay: Knicks to cover, with the
over on the 1st half of that same
game, the under on Amare’s points,
the Hawks to cover, and the Bulls
money line over the Cavs.
TELLER types bet into ticker.

14.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Next, I want another parlay-three
games, college football, I want
Boise State to cover, Notre Dame
money line, and the under on
Tennessee, I want that at 40 grand.
INT. MIRAGE CASINO, LAS VEGAS. NEAR SPORTS BOOK.
HOWARD stands at a blackjack table sipping from a glass of
water. He plays the DEALER alone, buying all seven hands
himself. Each hand has a short stack of $1,000 chips behind
them. He stares at faraway TV screens rolling ESPN.
Here long?

DEALER

HOWARD
On business, just for the night.
DEALER
Ah, you waiting for any games on
the east coast?
HOWARD
Yeah, all of them.
DEALER laughs. HOWARD looks at a pair of 3’s and a pair of 4’s.
He splits them both and doubles down on a 6/4 showing. A
WAITRESS approaches HOWARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Possible to get a whole bottle?
He presents his glass.
WAITRESS
Sparkling water?
HOWARD
(to DEALER)
Hit all of them.
WAITRESS
We can’t do a bottle, but I can
keep them coming.
HOWARD hits blackjack on one hand and low cards on all the
others.
HOWARD
(to WAITER)
That’s fine.
HOWARD tips her a $50 chip.
ESPN runs an interview with RAY FORECASTER, a prized
middleweight boxer, a superstar.

15.
FORECASTER wears sunglasses and multiple gold chains, showy. The
graphic underneath him reads, “RECORD PAY OUT FOR UPCOMING
VAIDANA FIGHT, $70 MILLION.”
His phone rings. “BLOCKED” number. He answers.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(calmly)
Yo... Oh, hey, yeah. Sorry, my
phone’s been off... Yeah, I went
right to the bank when they opened,
the money hasn’t cleared yet?...
That’s strange, the transaction
should be on file... Yeah, I got a
number right here...
DEALER
I’m sorry sir, there’s no phone use
on the floor.
HOWARD pays no mind to the dealer, instead he pretends to look
around for a piece of paper.
HOWARD
(to self)
Oh where is it... ah here it is...
You got a pen?... Ok, ready...
Transaction from branch 654, Palm
Beach, Florida: Transaction number
5A5889099231G, that’s G as in
Grenade...
DEALER
Sir, please...
HOWARD
(to DEALER)
One second
(into phone)
Okay, let me know.
HOWARD hangs up.
I’m sorry.

HOWARD (CONT’D)

DEALER
That’s fine.
(referring to cards)
What do you wanna do?
DEALER waits for a go on all hands.
HOWARD
Hit em all.
HOWARD busts on 5 of his 7 hands.

16.
INT. BELLAGIO HOTEL, LAS VEGAS. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. EVENING.
RAY FORCASTER, 35, middle-weight champion of the world, seen
earlier on TV, sits with a bong in his lap in a palatial suite.
SKANKS parade around in the background. A Championship Belt is
strewn over the edge of the couch. On a table sits a mountain of
$10,000 bundles arranged in a large pyramid.
RAY wears sunglasses and glances at one of his three phones.
HOWARD sits across from him, inspecting the contents of a
briefcase full of bedazzled jewelry.
HOWARD
Hey-yo, where’s the money sign
pinky ring?
HOWARD looks around the room and spots the ring on the finger of
PAC, a giant, BLACK BODYGUARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(tapping on his own pinky)
Hey big guy.
The bodyguard reluctantly hands the ring over.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to Ray)
Do they comp the bottles here or do
you have some type of deal with
them?
RAY
No, I pay for it all.
RAY watches a video of a jewel encrusted ROLLS ROYCE.
RAY (CONT’D)
How much he want for it?
HOWARD
See how it sparkles?
RAY
Yeah, I see, is it ready now?
HOWARD
Next week likely.
RAY
I gotta see it for real.
HOWARD
You know the Jews and the Blacks,
we’re the same people.
RAY reads a message on one of his phones. Then hands it to PAC.

17.
RAY
Pac... Post that, but make sure it
links TBT, TMT and shout out
Justin’s thing, say something about
catching dreams out the window.
PAC starts typing away on RAY’s phone. HOWARD continues to
itemize the contents of the briefcase.
HOWARD
The kids get their own suite?
RAY
Yeah, that staircase in the back
connects us- they put up posters in
their room and shit.
HOWARD arrives at a red diamond Cobra chain, RAY points to it as
he takes a bong hit.
RAY (CONT’D)
(while holding smoke in)
Wait... I wanna keep that one.
HOWARD
I can have something similar for
you by next week.
RAY
Fuck that. How much you want for
it?
HOWARD sends a text message to a “JO, B” asking “how much for
the red diamond cobra chain? Need to know now, w Forcaster”
RAY takes another hit. Sips from champagne. Empties a bottle.
HOWARD takes note of RAY getting more inebriated.
Reg!

RAY (CONT’D)

(beat)
Yo, Reg!
REG, a 7’4 heavy set black male, 30s appears.
RAY (CONT’D)
Grab me a few more bottles from the
fridge and a bunch of more ice,
this one is soupy.
Got you.

REG

HOWARD receives a text message, “25.”
HOWARD
I can do the cobra red for 50.

18.
50?!

RAY

HOWARD
Yeah... 50.
RAY
How bout 35?
HOWARD
You’re killing me Ray! Lowest I can
go is 45.
RAY
I’ll give you 40 right now.
HOWARD
Fuck it, gimme 40... but you know
I’m losing 5 grand on that for you.
RAY takes the chain from the briefcase, puts it around his neck
and stands up to look in a mirror.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Ray, lemme ask you something, is it
true you fly two G-6’s, one for you
and the other for your team.
RAY
You think I’m getting on a plane
with 3 Reggie’s? That’s half a ton
nigga. It’s not that much to have a
second plane, that type of shit is
over-inflated to the public. Like
people think it’s a million dollars
to fly a PJ. It’s only about an
extra 60, 70 grand. It’s my life(take bong hit, holding
breathe in)
Fuck that. They can ride in their
own plane.
HOWARD
I hear that. You got a plane going
back east tonight?
RAY
Tonight? No.
HOWARD
Shit, I gotta get back to NYC...
RAY
There’s one going back for my wife
tomorrow morning. She’s going on
some show in the morning around 10.
HOWARD
Can I hop on that?

19.
RAY
Yeah, okay.
HOWARD takes his camera out.
HOWARD
Let’s do an Instagram.
RAY
Reg, come take the bong.
HOWARD positions the phone/camera to frame both them, the
jewelry and the mountain of money behind them.
REG appears with a new bottle of champagne.
HOWARD
(while typing into phone)
Yo, Ray, gimme 50 grand.
Huh?

RAY

HOWARD
Gimme 50 grand.
RAY
(laughing)
For what?
HOWARD
For a shitty fuckin’ day. From one
bettor to another. What does that
mean to you? 50k?! I lost over 340
thousand dollars today, you know
that?
RAY
You lost 340 today?
HOWARD
I was up 200 grand and then fell, I
had a bad day- My nigga c’mon just
peel off 50k and give it to me.
RAY looks at HOWARD, now looking up and making eye-contact. RAY
slowly reaches for some cash, starts to count it out.
RAY
I’m gonna give you 50 grand, after
I just agreed to give you 35?
HOWARD
40- Yeah, but that’s for the chainRAY
-What am I gonna be getting in
return for this?

20.
Nothing.

HOWARD

RAY looks at HOWARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Nigga, it’s me. It’ll come back to
you.
RAY impulsively grabs 5 bundles and tosses it at HOWARD. HOWARD
immediately puts it in his briefcase.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You can hang onto one of those daydates too, those are mine..
RAY
Nigga, those shits are fake, you
think I don’t know that.
HOWARD
They’re not fake!
RAY
FakeWatchBusta already called a
nigga out TWICE for rockin’
those... C’mon.
HOWARD
You could sell them at a discount
for 10.
RAY
I’m not selling watches at all, let
alone fake onesHOWARD
They’re not fake!
RAY
Nigga, I know they are. It’s cool,
I feel the hustle, but I gotta a
story to tell and folex’s aren’t a
part of it.
HOWARD laughs, posts the picture of him and Ray on Instagram.
EXT. TETERBOROUGH PRIVATE AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - EARLY MORNING.
HOWARD exits the airport carrying one young black BOY on his
shoulders and an even younger GIRL in his arms. They climb off
of him as he double-kisses RAY’s wife goodbye. RAY’S FAMILY hop
into a pristine blacked out SUV.
HOWARD turns, looks around, sees YUSSI, HOWARD’S brother-in-law,
Sephardic, 36, swarthy, sits in a 7 series White BMW, and nods
in acknowledgement. HOWARD approaches the car and gets in.

21.
HOWARD
Where’s the bottles of water?
He finds a bottle under the chair.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Always keep these in the holders.
HOWARD, sweating, opens one and guzzles water like an animal.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Was there anyone waiting at Gems
when they opened this morning?
YUSSI
I came straight here, I know Dina’s
there now.
HOWARD
How do you know that?
(motions with hand)
Go, pull out of here.
YUSSI pulls the car out of its spot.
YUSSI
Because she called me 15 times this
morning.
HOWARD
What’s she saying?
YUSSI
I didn’t answer. Her texts were all
looking for you, threatening me
this that and the other.
They sit in the slow lane. This infuriates HOWARD, who motions
with his hands.
HOWARD
Go, go go! C’mon!
YUSSI laughs, HOWARD not amused.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Get out of this fuckin’ lane!
EXT. DIAMOND DISTRICT - 46TH STREET BTW 6TH AND 5TH - 11 AM
HOWARD and YUSSI jay-walk across the 46th street into an
arcade/throughway. HOWARD carries FLOWERS and a shopping bag.
INT. 47TH STREET JEWELRY ARCADE - CONTINUOUS
They enter a large arcade connecting 46th to 47th. The room is
congested, resembling a dingy bizarre.

22.
Hundreds of glass showcases divide the space into a maze of
narrow aisles. Dealers call out numbers. Others sit bored. TWO
HASIDS play cards on top of a display case. Another sucks on an
ice pop.
YUSSI and HOWARD cut diagonally across the room, using it as a
short cut to 47th Street.
HOWARD makes a quick pit-stop at one of the booths. JOSHUA, an
overweight middle-aged Jewish dealer, stands behind his
showcase, hunched over a plate of hot food.
HOWARD
You’re getting crumbs all over my
merchandise you disgusting pig.
JOSHUA
(unperturbed)
They were crumbs to begin with.
HOWARD
Look Josh, you’ve had ‘em for three
weeks nowJOSHUA
So take ‘em back. They’re wasting
valuable space.
HOWARD
I would. But I like you.
JOSHUA
Your breath smells like shit.
HOWARD slides JOSHUA’S lunch to the side of the counter, smiles
at JOSHUA and walks away.
EXT. 47TH ST BETWEEN 6TH & 5TH AVE, THE DIAMOND DISTRICT - AFTER
HOWARD and YUSSI walk east on 47th street past many HASIDIC MEN,
tourists and street peddlers. One STREET PEDDLER, runs up:
STREET PEDDLER
Howard! Take a look.
The STREET PEDDLER pulls a diamond encrusted HUBLOT watch from a
bag. Shows it to HOWARD. HOWARD can’t help but glance at it.
Eh.

HOWARD

STREET PEDDLER
All synthetic...
HOWARD
Not interested.

23.
35%.
No.

STREET PEDDLER
HOWARD

HOWARD and YUSSI move past the STREET PEDDLER and turn into a
building on “The Block.”
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
SADIE HOLMES, enters the showroom from the back. She’s tough,
she’s street, an attractive, NYC native, late 20s. She carries a
tray of small diamonds to a well-dressed WHITE GUY, 36.
SADIE
These are the VVS2’s we have in the
1 to 2 carat range.
WHITE GUY
How much more are we talking if we
went to flawless.
SADIE
At this size, probably a good
amount, the difference is big.
Unless you wanna go synthetic, I
would go with a 2 carat at this
clarity.
The WHITE GUY inspects the stones. SADIE uses a tweezer to place
them against different style bands.
WHITE GUY
I want her to feel royal. Something
that’ll impress her friends.
SADIE
When I first was proposed to he
gave me a V1 diamond, but big, and
I personally found it to be trashy,
diamonds are everywhere on that
level.
WHITE GUY laughs, inspects options.
SADIE (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
Look, get something like this, do a
Channel setting with two smaller
stones next to it. That’s classy.
WHITE GUY likes it. Takes out his phone.
WHITE GUY
You mind if I take some pictures?
SADIE
Not to show her I hope!

24.
WHITE GUY
Nah. Her girlfriends.
LARRY, mid 40’s, shaved head, track suit, interrupts them.
LARRY
What are those did you say?
Huh?

SADIE

LARRY
You said those are what type of
diamonds?
SADIE
(caught off-guard)
These are VVS-2s. You interested in
something?
LARRY
I wanna put together a ring.
SADIE
JOANI, will you help this man.
JOANI, a co-worker, late 20’s, Sephardic Jew from Long-Island,
turns from her computer.
JOANI
What can I do for you?
LARRY
How much are these?
JOANI
Depends on the cut, which one are
you interested in?
Hmmmmmm.

LARRY

JOANI
Do you have a wholesale license?
LARRY
To be honest, I’m really just
waiting for Howard... But I am
interested in this.
BUZZZZZ! SADIE looks over to the security monitor and sees
HOWARD and YUSSI waiting outside the door.
She buzzes them through the first set of doors. They enter into
a small vestibule and wait several seconds for the door behind
them to completely close.
JOANI
I’m not following you.

25.
LARRY
I wanna buy something...
SADIE buzzes them through the second door into the showroom.
HOWARD
Larry? Oh for Christ’s sake.
LARRY
No, Howard, you need to listenHOWARD hands ELAN, 19, HOWARD’s nephew and staff errand boy, his
briefcase.
HOWARD
Take that down to JO’s.
ELAN is buzzed out of the space. HOWARD hands his phone to
SADIE.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Charge this for me.
HOWARD pinches her ass. SADIE jerks away.
SADIE
(quietly)
DINA’s in the backroom.
I know.

HOWARD

YUSSI walks behind the showcase and into the backroom.
YUSSI
Oh hey, DINA.
DINA (O.S.)
You don’t wanna answer my calls?
What kind of brother are you...
HOWARD!
DINA, 40s, olive-skinned, made up, Sephardic, storms into the
showroom.
DINA (CONT’D)
(yelling)
Why is the account overdrawn?! I
went by the bank and they told me
there’s nothing they can do until
more funds are there. What is
that?!
HOWARD
It’s nothing, it’s a mistake. You
want these?
HOWARD tries to give her the flowers. She swats them onto the
floor.

26.
DINA
Shove em up your ass. Time-Warner
and Gas arent paid. We’ll have no
gas and no TV.
HOWARD
They’re not shutting anything off,
you idiot. It’s just a big
misunderstanding, I’m moving funds
around.
DINA
Why is Carmelle calling me at 1am
last night, non stop? Huh!?! Why is
she blaming me- you- for all her
furniture missing. Why is her
furniture missing?
HOWARD
(annoyed)
And what do you think I’ve been
doing for the past 36 hours?
Sailing?
DINA
I have no idea what you do.
HOWARD
It’s a big misunderstanding, Honey,
this gentlemanDINA
-The debit card isnt working eitherHOWARD
-I said don’t worry about it. It’s
all being taken care of.
DINA
Don’t lie to me Howard.
HOWARD points to the showroom. HOWARD says quietly.
HOWARD
What are you doing? Why are you
doing this in front of everyone
here?
DINA’s phone rings. She looks at it. Silences it.
DINA
I have shit I have to do!
DINA’s phone rings again. She shows the Caller ID to HOWARD.
DINA (CONT’D)
It’s Eddie... great.
She answers it.

27.
DINA (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Eddie... Yes, I’m here with daddy,
what’s up... I don’t know
(looks to HOWARD)
Are you coming home for dinner?
Possibly.

HOWARD

DINA
(into phone)
No, he’s not coming.
LARRY watches HOWARD attentively. JOANI plays on her phone. DINA
ACTIVELY avoids eye contact with SADIE and retreats to the
backroom.
LARRY
Listen HowardHOWARD, now visibly annoyed, looks down at the tray of gems.
HOWARD
What is this!?!
(to SADIE)
Sadie, put this back in the safe.
LARRY
Wait a second. You haven’t been
calling me back and the address you
gave me was no good so I figured I
would come to where you work to get
what you owe me.
HOWARD
(laughing)
You realize this stuff isn’t mine.
This is all on loan. Who am I? King
Tut?
LARRY
You can’t keep stiffing me like
this. And I hear you’re placing
bets with otherHOWARD pulls LARRY aside so no one can hear their conversation.
HOWARD
Listen, Larry I told you I would
have the money in a week.
LARRY
I don’t care, I’m not fucking
around here Howard, I need that
money! I WANT IT NOW!
WHITE GUY glances in their direction.

28.
HOWARD
Larry, will you hold on a second?
HOWARD dips into the back room...
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
DINA still on the phone, gathering her things. She now has
sunglasses on. HOWARD approaches her, she pushes him away
annoyed.
HOWARD
(whispering)
Here, take this and go get yourself
something nice at Barney’s, get
lunch at Fred’s...
HOWARD shoves a handful of cash into her jacket pocket. She
removes the bundle for a second, looks at it, pulls away from
the phone and looks at HOWARD.
See?

HOWARD (CONT’D)

HOWARD and DINA rejoin the showroom...
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
DINA, engaged with the phone, leads HOWARD.
DINA
(into phone)
Baby, no, I’m leaving Daddy now,
will you give me a second... hey!
Hold on a second.
(to HOWARD)
Okay, I’ll call you after Barney’s,
but call the bank and straighten
all this out now.
Of course.

HOWARD

DINA is buzzed out of the space.
LARRY
So there’s enough for Barney’s but
not enough for me?
HOWARD
How dare you!?! Can’t you see that
I got a lot of shit going on right
now? I haven’t touched over 5 grand
in a month, seriously. I just got
out of the hospital.

29.
LARRY
Your word is nothing, I went by the
hospital.
HOWARD
Which hospital?
Sinai.

LARRY

HOWARD
I told you Beth Israel.
LARRY
No, you didnt. But I checked there
too.
When?
Friday.

HOWARD
LARRY

HOWARD
I was let out on Wednesday...
(assures him)
You want to see the hospital
bracelet?
BUZZZZ! A large black BODY GUARD appears on the surveillance
monitor. SADIE buzzes them in. The BODY GUARD enters and
immediately barks orders to the showroom.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Larry, I’m sorry, you’re gonna have
to leave. Call me on my cell.
LARRY
Your cell’s no good.
HOWARD starts to walk him towards the door.
HOWARD
The 987 number?
Yeah.

LARRY

HOWARD
That one’s no good anymore, Larry,
I told you that... Call 917 871
4147.
LARRY enters the numbers into his phone and immediately calls
it. A pause. Howard’s cellphone RINGS.
We good?

HOWARD (CONT’D)

30.
BODY GUARD 1 tugs on LARRY’s arm.
BODYGUARD 1
Alright, pack it up, you gotta get
outta here.
LARRY looks over to HOWARD for assistance.
HOWARD
Sorry, Larry... Next week, I
promise...
HOWARD points to the bouncers.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
This could be the answers to all
our problems.
The BODYGUARDS pressure LARRY out of the office.
BODYGUARD 1
Alright, everyone out.
WHITE GUY
I was in the middle of...
(looks to SADIE)
Tell him, I just was.
SADIE
I’m sorry, hon.
Seriously?

WHITE GUY

BODYGUARD 2 walks over and begins to nudge the WHITE GUY.
HOWARD
Come back in an hour or so.
As WHITE GUY leaves, AMARE STOUDEMIRE, 30, black, a 7 foot
superstar basketball player enters the space, kissing a mezuzah
on his way in. With him are DEMANY, 30, black, flashy, wearing a
lot of jewlery, PRIVELEJ, 29, heavy-set rapper, lots of jewelry,
a YOUNGER BLACK MALE and a WHITE YOUNG WOMAN.
DEMANY embraces HOWARD.
DEMANY
What’s Gucci Howard?
Demany!

HOWARD

DEMANY introduces AMARE.
DEMANY
AMARE, that’s Howard.

31.
HOWARD
(with arms outstretched)
Baruch hashem, AMARE. I can’t begin
to tell you what an honor it is to
have you here, in MY showroom. You
happen to be a personal hero of
mine, and I want you to feel
entirely at home here, and needless
to say, what’s mine is yours.
AMARE
(sweetly, softly)
I appreciate being here. When I
enter into a new environment what I
most prefer is the freedom to
explore my space, quietly and
peacefully, and let things come to
me... do you mind if I do that?
HOWARD
Not at all... Sadie.
(to Sadie)
Can you bring AMARE some
refreshments?
HOWARD offers a hundred dollar bill to SADIE.
SADIE
What should IAMARE
I’m not thirsty. I’m not hungry.
But thank you. Can I explore?
HOWARD
Be my guest.
AMARE quietly surveys the showroom. He begins by examining the
photo gallery on the walls: a collection of famous people posing
with HOWARD...e.g. JR Smith, Patrick Ewing, Cam’ron, Cindy
Lauper, Wiz Khalifa, Ja Rule, Al Goldstein, Cypress Hill, Ray
Forcaster... etc.. HOWARD watches him in great anticipation.
DEMANY
(To HOWARD, whispering)
I hook you up or what?
HOWARD
(whispering)
You’re incredible.
DEMANY
(whispering)
I told you I’d bring AMARE, and
what I do? What I do?
HOWARD
(whispering)
You brought AMARE.

32.
AMARE explores the showcases muttering quietly to himself. The
rest of the posse start to browse as well, while PRIVELEJ sidles
up to SADIE.
PRIVELEJ
Look at you, huh.
SADIE
What about me?
PRIVELEJ
(to HOWARD)
How much for her?
SADIE reaches over and grabs PRIVELEJ’S cellphone from his hand.
SADIE
How much for you?
She starts looking through the photos on his phone. HOWARD looks
annoyed.
PRIVELEJ
Oh, you’re dangerous. I like that!
(to DEMANY)
Yo this girl is tight. Grabs my
phone like that!
SADIE zooms in on a nude picture of PRIVELEJ.
PRIVELEJ (CONT’D)
Alright, give it back to me.
YUSSI re-enters the space, he rests his arms on the showcase.
DEMANY
(to YUSSI)
That’s that Day-date with the
President bracelet?
YUSSI holds his wrist out for DEMANY.
YUSSI
Yeah, solid yellow. You like it?
DEMANY
Shit’s hot.
(to PRIVELEJ)
Yo Priv, check out this Roley.
PRIVELEJ leaves SADIE and moves over to inspects YUSSI’S Rolex.
HOWARD, again, looks annoyed.
YUSSI
I can get them for you in yellow or
Rose for cheap.
PRIVELEJ
Oh yeah, how much?

33.
23 or 24.

YUSSI

PRIVELEJ
That’s a good price. With the box
and papers?
YUSSI
With box and papers.
PRIVELEJ
(to DEMANY)
We gotta get AMARE up on this.
HOWARD approaches YUSSI.
HOWARD
(whispering)
YUSSI, please, what are you doing?
YUSSI
(whispering)
What?
HOWARD
(whispering)
Stop! Now!
HOWARD drifts back. YUSSI, upset, retreats to the backroom.
DEMANY
(To AMARE, whispering)
This nigga can encrust anything.
HOWARD
(soft, eager)
Anything you want. I’m your nigga.
AMARE
Is this true?
HOWARD
Of course...
AMARE shifts his weight from one knee to other, and stretches.
SADIE
(laughing)
You have the longest arms. Hold ‘em
out.
AMARE smiles and displays his incredible wingspan.
SADIE (CONT’D)
That’s insane.
HOWARD
Just incredible...

34.
SADIE laughs. Leaning on the showcase, AMARE looks at the gems.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You’re going to that big ball?
AMARE
How do you know about that?
HOWARD
I know everything.
AMARE
Yeah... I want something Hebrew.
HOWARD
(laughing)
Hebrew...
AMARE
Maybe a Hai with a little...
HOWARD
Don’t say ice... You’re not a
diamond guy, everyone’s got
diamonds.
AMARE
What do you mean by that?
HOWARD
You’re not an ice guy,
AMARE
(joking)
No more Mr. Ice guy.
HOWARD
(laughing)
Sure a little ice here and there,
but you’re like a pigeon vein blood
red ruby or a dancing sapphire...
(readjusting)
Look, if you want stones, I can get
that for you too... I take care of
people I love, ask anyone.
SADIE
What about that ruby Jo sent over?
HOWARD
The cushion 6? Yeah, go get that.
SADIE heads to the backroom. EMANY, AMARE and PRIVLEJ inspect
the pieces out on the showcase.
SADIE returns and places a box in front of HOWARD.

35.
YUSSI
(gruff)
I’m out. Be back in an hour.
DEMANY
I’ll let you know about that DayDate. Come by Priv’s show(redirects to HOWARD)
Yo, Howard, you too. You gotta come
to Priv’s show tomorrow night.
HOWARD
Tomorrow? Sure. Wait, fuck, I have
my kid’s play...
PRIVELEJ
(to SADIE)
You should come.
Where?

SADIE

PRIVELEJ
Webster hall. I go on around 10.
HOWARD
Oh! I can make it by then.
PRIVELEJ
(to SADIE)
What about you?
SADIE
I can be there whenever.
HOWARD
Yeah, I’ll meet up with you guys at
10, or just before, probably.
YUSSI
I can’t come tomorrow, but text me
about the Day-date. Joani, buzz.
YUSSI hands DEMANY a card and is buzzed out.
AMARE
Demany, what time is it?
HOWARD
What time you gotta be somewhere?
DEMANY
Nigga, Howard’s good people.
JOANI
Show him the ruby.

36.
HOWARD pulls a gold jeweler’s loupe from a necklace around his
neck. He hands the loupe to AMARE and offers him the ruby. AMARE
leans heavily on the showcase.
HOWARD
Amare, sorry but if you need to
lean on the case, please lean on
the edges, not the glass, please.
AMARE puts the loupe down, disinterested.
AMARE
I don’t feel this.
BUZZZZ! NADAV appears at the door with a large Styrofoam crate
over his shoulder. SADIE buzzes him in.
HOWARD
Who’s that?
Nadav.

SADIE

NADAV enters carrying an enormous wooden crate. HOWARD grows
excited, puts his arm around AMARE.
HOWARD
Oh... my... god, AMARE. You’re
gonna LOVE this.
NADAV moves towards the backroom. HOWARD follows him.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Amare, gimme a second, please. It’s
for you. Please. I’ve got a bunch
of Powerade in the fridge...
AMARE
Thank you. I’m not thirsty.
HOWARD
(to SADIE)
Show ‘em what we did with Fat Joe.
(To AMARE)
When he was actually fat!
HOWARD hurries into the back room.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD now serious.
HOWARD
(to NADAV)
It’s heavy?

37.
NADAV
(without breathing)
Yeah...
Yes!

HOWARD

NADAV puts the crate down on the desk. HOWARD grabs a crowbar
and cracks open the case. Inside is a styrofoam crate and inside
that are 4 large fish wrapped in clear vacuum sealed bags.
He slices one of them open, searches inside, nothing... He grabs
another fish, cuts it open. Nothing. He grabs another, slices
and pulls out a wet black plastic bag the size of a grapefruit.
Inside this bag is a large uncut 600 carat Black Opal (the gem
from the African mine). He grabs a loupe and looks into an
opening in the gem.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
IT’S... IT’S BEAUTIFUL!!
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD rushes out of the back room, gem in hand. NADAV follows.
HOWARD
This is your lucky day, Amare.
HOWARD presents the BLACK OPAL to AMARE who leans on the glass
showcase to look at it.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
VERY special. From an untapped mine
in Ethiopia.
HOWARD hands him a loupe. AMARE takes it and looks into the gem.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I can have it cut up and have a
couple carats set into anything,
earrings, charms, been tracking it
for a while, not easy to get...
AMARE closely inspects the gem, transfixed.
INT. INSIDE THE GEMSTONE - CONTINUOUS
The camera zooms into the GEM. Again, we see a kaleidoscope of
color, light, and swirling abstract shapes. A psychedelic trip.
Hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
CRAAAASH! All of a sudden, AMARE’s elbows break through the
glass showcase. HOWARD, JOANI and SADIE scream, DEMANY and
PRIVELEJ jump back in shock.

38.
BODY GUARD 1
AMARE! FUCK!
AMARE’S arms are covered in blood. He pulls himself out of his
reverie. SADIE runs over with some paper towels and tends to his
elbows.
HOWARD
I said don’t lean on it! You all
heard me!
AMARE
(dazed)
Let me take it tonight.
What?

HOWARD

AMARE
Lemme have it tonight. I need it.
HOWARD
I- It’s set for auction next
week... I’m already late for
appraisal...
AMARE gives him a deep soulful stare.
AMARE
One night. 16 hours. What’s 16
hours with sleep?
HOWARD
Amar’e, I’m sorry.
AMARE
I’ll gram 3 pictures of you and me
together right now- And! I’ll post
a pic of the stone afterwards and
say ‘my game shines because of it.’
HOWARD
Ah shit. Tag NAGY in the picture
and in the comment?
Of course.

AMARE

HOWARD
Follow me and ‘like’ 30 pictures.
AMARE
This very second.
HOWARD thinks long and hard.
HOWARD
Tomorrow, ok? No excuses.

39.
AMARE
You have my word, Howard.
BODY GUARD 1
You better pray he’s good tonight.
HOWARD
Wha’?! It’s glass, it’s not meant
to support all that weight.
INT. BORATTA’S RESTAURANT - EARLY EVENING
HOWARD strolls into the restaurant. ANTHONY, an impeccably
groomed Italian, mid 40’s, sits at a corner table quietly
enjoying a steak. He looks up.
ANTHONY
Howard, what are you doing here?
HOWARD
You don’t answer my calls.
ANTHONY
I don’t answer your calls because
there’s no reason for us to talk.
HOWARD
I wanna make a play.
ANTHONY
I’m done taking your action.
HOWARD
-I got cash for you baby. Not
looking for a credit line.
HOWARD pulls a manila envelope from his jacket.
65 grand.

HOWARD (CONT’D)

HOWARD slides a Rolex watch box towards ANTHONY.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
And this, for putting up with me.
ANTHONY
What do you want?
HOWARD
A parlay. 5 teams.
ANTHONY
You wanna do a 5 way sixty-five k?!
A WAITRESS passes by.

40.
HOWARD
Honey, a diet coke please.
WAITRESS
How are you Ant?
ANTHONY
Fine. Thanks.
WAITRESS leaves.
HOWARD
I want the Knicks money-line, wanna
do that with the over on Amare’s
points plus rebounds, the Thunder
to cover, King’s 2nd quarter, and
the under on the Blazers/Heat, but
I want to buy half a point.
ANTHONY
That’s like 4 to 1...
Yeah.

HOWARD

ANTHONY
Too much trouble. You gotta spread
a bet like that out over more
books.
HOWARD
I can’t take it elsewhere.
ANTHONY
And why not?
HOWARD
Look, I got the cash here now. You
want my action or not?
ANTHONY
Fuck it, I’ll lay a bunch of it
off... gimme the envelope.
HOWARD hands ANTHONY the envelope.
HOWARD
Perfect! I don’t know how you make
it in your business, being so kind.
ANTHONY
Enough. Let me eat.
HOWARD
You know what, I’ll get a bite,
what’s good here?
(to WAITRESS)
Can I see a menu?

41.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
HOWARD sits in a loud, crowded sports bar watching the Knicks
game and surveying his Instagram account. A notification pops up
to inform him that he has 549 new followers. He clicks on a
photo of himself and AMARE taken earlier in his showroom. In it,
HOWARD is making the peace sign. The comment: “@Chocol8Monsta:
peep this sweaty fatass JEWler”
ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
A mythical performance from AMARE
Stoudemire!
HOWARD looks up to the television.
COLOR COMMENTATOR (ON TV)
29 points, 15 rebounds and 7
assists and still 28 minutes of
basketball to play.
HOWARD claps his hands like a circus seal.
ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
This will go down in history. And
he’s playing with those cumbersome
bandages!
AMARE appears at the free throw with bandages on his elbows. He
adjusts them before his shot.
HOWARD
(to self)
Okay, great, that’s two...
(to BARTENDER)
What’s the score of the Thunder
game?
The BARTENDER looks at his phone.
BARTENDER
Up by 4 with six remaining.
HOWARD
Okay, I gotta run.
HOWARD throws a fifty dollar bill onto the bar.
EXT. 3RD AVENUE. AFTER.
HOWARD listens to a game on his phone while walking.
BROADCASTER (VOICE)
...12 points, 10 rebounds and 9
assists, just one shy of a triple
double.

42.
BROADCASTER 2 (VOICE)
You know, if I’m Eastrick, I’m
thinking about this victory. When
he’s not looking to score, they
function much better as a team.
HOWARD stops walking.
HOWARD
No, No... Don’t dribble it out.
BROADCASTER 1 (VOICE)
Yeah, they should just be able to
dribble this one out, 110 to 100.
BROADCASTER 2 (VOICE)
Wait, what? It looks like Eastrick
just called a time out!
BROADCASTER 1
Yes, Eastrick calls a time out with
15 seconds to go. Bizarre!
HOWARD
Yes, yes! Eastrick, go for the
triple double!
HOWARD stands in the middle of the sidewalk.
BROADCASTER 2 (VOICE)
Wow, Adelman’s upset. Looks like he
told his team to stay at center
court, allowing Eastrick a free
ride to his triple double. Adelman
doesn’t like this one bit...
HOWARD stands in shock, the biggest smile starting to emerge.
BROADCASTER 1
Eastrick catches an inbound pass,
passes to Nar Touré up-court who
slams it in for 2 points! This is
incredible. There’s the buzzer.
Yesssssss!

HOWARD

BROADCASTER 2
And with that final assist the
Thunder win it 112-100
HOWARD
Holy fucking shit! I hit! I hit!
Enraptured, HOWARD almost throws his phone against a building.
BROADCASTER 1
This will be infamous. Adelman has
already left the floor, and none of
the players are shaking hands.

43.
BROADCASTER 2
Yeah, I’m not sure I’m a fan of
this-Greedy, unsportsmanlike,
selfish, self-serving, I’m with
Adelman here.
HOWARD realizes he’s standing right in front of Wollenky’s
steakhouse.
EXT. EAST 55TH STREET - AFTER
HOWARD carries two take-out bags from Wollensky’s. He sees a bum
sleeping on his side.
Hey?

HOWARD

HOWARD leans in for another look.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Hey, you up? You like steak?
The HOMELESS GUY doesn’t move. HOWARD removes a container of
food from one of his bags and places it next to the sleeping
man. He then pulls out a bankroll of money, peels off a few
$100s and shoves ‘em into the HOMELESS GUY’s coat pocket.
The HOMELESS GUY suddenly springs up. HOWARD sees his face; a
gaunt grizzled toothless horror show.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
AAAAAAHHHHH!
HOWARD scurries away as quickly as possible.
INT. HOWARD’S APARMENT BUILDING - JUST AFTER
HOWARD approaches the door of his apartment building. A doorman
runs to open it for him.
NAGY!

ALEX DOORMAN

HOWARD walks in.
HOWARD
Alex, my friend, how are you?
All good.

ALEX DOORMAN

HOWARD asks FRANK, a concierge behind a desk.
HOWARD
Frank, anything?

44.
No, Sir.

FRANK CONCIERGE

HOWARD
If anyone comes by, we left town.
FRANK CONCIERGE
Of course, Sir.
HOWARD steps into the elevator.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT- KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - AFTER
HOWARD kicks off his shoes in a small vestibule and throws his
keys onto a side table.
HOWARD
Sadie! Baby! YO, YO! I got dinner.
The vestibule opens up onto the living room, which is littered
with gizmos and gadgets; the kind of ware only offered on
television infomercials and in-flight catalogues.
The apartment is the epitome of garish nouveau riche decor;
shiny blacks surfaces, faux marble, leather, wall to wall
carpeting, a big salt-water fish-tank.
HOWARD walks to the bedroom.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The room is a mess. Clothes spill out from the closet, the
California-King bed is unmade. The mirrors surrounding the big
bed have smudges on them.
Yo!

HOWARD

HOWARD walks into the bathroom.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT- BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
SADIE springs up in the bathtub.
HOWARD
What’s up, you don’t say hello?
SADIE
(covering herself)
I’m in the tub!
HOWARD
Why you covering yourself up?
SADIE
I don’t know.

45.
HOWARD
(looks around)
I brought you a steak from
Wollensky’s, with the crunchy onion
strings and vegetable sides.
SADIE
Thanks. I’ll eat it later.
HOWARD looks at SADIE’s legs in the tub.
SADIE (CONT’D)
(doesn’t care)
Oh, yeah. There were a bunch of
messages from the management about
rent payment not going through.
Uh huh.

HOWARD

SADIE
They were pretty upset about it.
HOWARD
I’ll deal with it.
HOWARD still annoyed that she’s covering herself.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Why’re there smudge marks all over
the mirror near the bed?
SADIE
I don’t know. I touched it.
HOWARD
You touched it?
(beat)
Ya know, I can get a maid to come
by more than once a week.
SADIE
(short)
No need to waste money.
HOWARD
Then, you should pick up around
here, a maid once a week should be
enough and she charges me more when
it gets like this, all messy, I’m
not made of money.
HOWARD flips the fan on.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You should use this, it conditions
the air, makes it feel fresh. Also
the moisture will mold up the
wallpaper.

46.
HOWARD organizes the toiletries around the sink.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Stinks like cigarettes in here.
It’s disgusting. The whole place
reeks of cigarettes.
SADIE
It’ll air out.
HOWARD
Well it hasn’t...
SADIE
Can you please give me some
privacy? I’m gonna get out.
HOWARD
Just get out with me in here, I
wanna clean.
SADIE
Howard, out.
HOWARD exits.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT- HOWARD’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD examines the smudge marks on the mirror while he
unbuttons his shirt. They look like different types of
fingerprints. HOWARD shifts out of it, turns on a 70 inch
television and leaves the room.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT- KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD grabs a remote and powers up each of his 6 flat screens,
one at a time. ESPN, NBA TV, ESPN 2, HBO, Shopping Network.
AMARE appears on one of the TV’s for a post game interview. It’s
muted but AMARE appears to be giddy. HOWARD un-mutes it.
HOWARD makes a call on his phone.
AMARE
(on TV)
Sometimes the gods beckon you from
above...
(smiles)
Tonight, I guess we saw that
communication.
HOWARD
(to TV/AMARE)
I love you!
HOWARD waltzes back into his bedroom.

47.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT- HOWARD’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
AMARE appears on his bedroom TV as well. SADIE is standing
behind an open closet door changing into a nightgown.
HOWARD
(into phone)
Demany, it’s Howard. I’m sure you
guys are out celebrating- Listen, I
have a lot riding on that gem, I
was crazy to give it to him in the
first place. Not that I mind, but I
absolutely need it back in my hands
tomorrow morning, by 9am. Alright?
You don’t have to call me back,
just please make sure you’re at the
office at 9 with the gem.
HOWARD hangs up.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
What is this hiding from me shit?!
HOWARD walks over to the closet and closes the door, exposing
SADIE topless in her underwear.
SADIE
Howard, stop!
HOWARD
Stop what? Stop buying you things?
Stop bringing you your favorite
food? You know I was in an
incredible mood when I came in. I
come home and the place is like
shit.
SADIE
The place is fuckin’ fine!
HOWARD
Who was in the apartment?
No one!

SADIE

HOWARD runs over to the smudge marks on the mirror.
HOWARD
Whose finger prints are these?
There are more than one set of
prints here!
SADIE
You’re acting like a crazy person.
HOWARD
I don’t think so.

48.
SADIE
I’m not gonna argue with you about
this.
HOWARD
What do you even have to argue?
SADIE ignores HOWARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Huh!?! I’ve had a terrible 48 hours
and you don’t even ask how I’m
doing?
SADIE
You just said you were feeling
incredible.
HOWARD
But before that I wasn’t. Everyone
asks me bullshit all day, all they
do is want! They all want something
from me, what is that? It’s not a
good feeling. Soon I’ll be all
skin, no meat.
SADIE
I’m sorry, Howard, how are you?
HOWARD
I seriously was on a high when I
walked in, felt like a million
bucks, really! I went and got you
that food, for usSADIE
I can’t help it that I ate already.
HOWARD
Did you even know I had to go to
Florida?
SADIE
No. How could I know that?
HOWARD
But you weren’t wondering where I
was. Did you even notice that I was
gone?
SADIE
Of course I did.
SADIE warms up a little, leans against wall.
SADIE (CONT’D)
You’re right. I’m sorry Howie.

49.
HOWARD
(looks at her legs)
You know what’s crazy? I just had a
sudden impulse to fuck you from
behind.
SADIE retracts.
SADIE
Jesus, Howard!
SADIE storms out of the room. On the television: a heroic slowmotion shot of AMARE flying through the air.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - MORNING
A phone set on speaker blares rings throughout the backroom,
which buzzes with morning activity. ELAN works on a setting,
NADAV trolls Instagram, YUSSI does inventory.
HOWARD sits at his desk in front of the phone waiting for
someone to pick up. He stares at the time on his computer.
10:27AM.
The call goes to voicemail: an excerpt of Biggie’s ‘Gimme One
More Chance.’
VOICEMAIL
Biggie, gimme me one more chance...
BEEP.
HOWARD
DEMANY GOD DAMMIT. It’s now 10:30!
Answer.. Your... Phone!!!
EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DIAMOND DISTRICT- AFTER
HOWARD is rushing to the subway when LARRY [the bookie that
HOWARD blew off in the first showroom scene] sidles up alongside
him.
Hi Howard.

LARRY

HOWARD
(startled)
I can’t stop and talk, I’m sorry.
LARRY
(interrupting)
Why do you think you can SON me
like this?
Not now!

HOWARD

50.
LARRY
I heard about you’re $65,000 parlay
yesterday.
HOWARD
What of it?
LARRY
I need that 80 grand. I’m really
not fucking around here. I need
something now.
HOWARD pulls up his sleeve, exposing a Rolex watch.
HOWARD
You see this watch?
HOWARD unbuckles it. Takes it off his wrist
HOWARD (CONT’D)
That’s 28 thousand brand new.
LARRY inspects it.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You can sell that easy used for 15.
Where?

LARRY

HOWARD
Anywhere. Wimpy’s.
HOWARD’s phone rings. He looks to the Caller ID: It’s GABI.
HOWARD instantly dismisses the call.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Okay, I need to take this. We good?
Good!?!

LARRY

HOWARD
I mean til the end of the week.
HOWARD descends into a subway station. Tourists clog the stairs.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
C’mon, c’mon... It’s not a fuckin’
escalator.
EXT. BED-STUY PROJECTS - AFTERNOON
HOWARD walks past a group of YOUNG BLACK MALES shooting dice. He
enters a building.

51.
INT. DEMANY’S APARTMENT
DEMANY opens the door, he looks hung over, tired.
Sup.

DEMANY

HOWARD
I said 9. 9am sharp.
DEMANY
I just woke up.
HOWARD
Utter horseshit!
DEMANY
Chill! We were in the club til 5 in
the morning.
HOWARD
You didn’t see my calls? I called
over 20 times.
DEMANY
I haven’t been using the phone at
all today. Just kickin it at home.
What’s goin’ on?
HOWARD
I was absolutely crazy to lend the
gem out. But that’s me, I’m crazy,
right?
DEMANY
You’re crazy.
HOWARD
You don’t understand. The thing is
sold. I have people waiting.
DEMANY
(annoyed)
Alright! I’ll talk to AMARE.
HOWARD
Now. Call him now.
DEMANY
I will, gimme a minute.
DEMANY opens fridge and slowly pours himself some orange juice.
DEMANY (CONT’D)
That was an insane game, huh? He
was turnt all the way up. They say
there’s never been a 40, 30, 10
game before.

52.
HOWARD
Call AMARE.
DEMANY
He’s at practice now. He’s not
gonna pick up the phone.
HOWARD
Call him and tell him I’ll give him
that ruby for a few days instead.
DEMANY
Howard, you’re not listening to me.
He... is... at... practice.
HOWARD
Okay, let’s go to practice.
DEMANY
(laughing)
You crazy.
HOWARD
This is a million fuckin’ dollar
gem. You want that chain, don’t
you?
DEMANY
Howard, you owe me that chain for
bringing you AMARE in the first
place.
INT. DEMANY’S LEXUS - DAY
DEMANY and HOWARD drive on the BQE in DEMANY’s red Lexus. Loud
hip-hop on the stereo: a track called “ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,”
which features central lyrics, “It’s all about the mother
fuckin’ money...”
HOWARD
This Privelej?
DEMANY focuses on his phone and the road.
DEMANY
Yea, Troy Ave and me produced it.
HOWARD bobs his head to the music.
HOWARD
Very good. You produced the beat?
DEMANY
Troy did. You should hook him up
with some shine for the video.
HOWARD
He should put me in the video!

53.
HOWARD listens to the music, adds:
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You know what kind of money I hit
on yesterday?
DEMANY
(not paying attention)
What’s that?
HOWARD
I hit a 5 way parlay, you know what
that means?
(beat)
It means after Amare, I’m gonna go
collect a lot of cash!
DEMANY checks his phone. HOWARD cranes his neck to see.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
That AMARE?
DEMANY
Get out my business nigga.
HOWARD
Lemme ask you a question, you fuck
a lot of your own girls, or you get
AMARE’s run off?
DEMANY
I handle my own shit.
HOWARD
Lemme ask you another question,
you’ve seen AMARE’s dick?
Aaaaa-yo!

DEMANY

HOWARD
What? I saw he did that nude thing
for ESPN magazine, was kind of
misleading.
INT. KNICKS PRACTICE FACILITY - AFTER
A crowd of press gather on the court where team officials buzz
about.
DEMANY and HOWARD walk up to the locker room entrance. DEMANY
greets the SECURITY GUARD.
DEMANY
What up big?
The SECURITY GUARD moves aside for DEMANY. HOWARD closes in
behind DEMANY. The SECURITY GUARD stops HOWARD.

54.
HOWARD
No, I’m with him.
DEMANY
I don’t know that nigga, he ain’t
with me.
What!?!

HOWARD

DEMANY, without looking back, walks towards the locker room.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(yells)
DEMANY! YO!
DEMANY disappears into the locker room.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Ohhhh you piece of shit! You son of
a bitch.
SECURITY GUARD
Sir, you need to back away.
HOWARD
You see that shit? You saw us
arrive together.
SECURITY GUARD
I didn’t see anything. Step aside.
HOWARD pulls two hundred dollar bills from his pocket.
HOWARD
I need 3 minutes. You can time me.
The SECURITY GUARD ignores the gesture and starts dealing with
the next person in line.
EXT. CITY STREET - AFTER
HOWARD rushes down a city street checking his phone.
INT. LACE STRIP CLUB - AFTERNOON
HOWARD enters smiling ear-to-ear. ANTHONY clears a chair at his
table. Before he’s at the table, HOWARD’s talking:
HOWARD
You said it was a crazy bet!
ANTHONY
Howard, sit down.
HOWARD sits.

55.
HOWARD
Look, I’m not expecting all of it
right now. Let’s say the 65 I put
down, plus half for now... so,
like, 95ANTHONY
There’s no money Howard.
HOWARD
NO MONEY!?! I HIT THE BET ANTHONY,
I HIT A FUCKIN’ 5 TEAM PARLAY.
ANTHONY
Stop acting. You know why there’s
no money.
HOWARD
What are you talking about?
ANTHONY
(calmly)
I told you I was gonna lay it off.
I went to Jim. He could tell right
away it was your bet. He told me
already you’re into him for 375.
HOWARD freaks out, starts making noises, gesticulating wildly.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
He took your 65 grand straight up.
HOWARD
He doesnt have the right to do
that.
ANTHONY
He would have done the same for me.
HOWARD
Fuck Jim and fuck you! This is
theft! You’re a thief!
ANTHONY
Howard don’t make a scene.
But I hit!

HOWARD

ANTHONY
No you did not.
HOWARD
Yes I did! I sat right in this
chair and placed a bet and I hit!
ANTHONY
I had to do the right thing. You
can’t go around playing with other
people’s money. It’s offensive.

56.
ANTHONY extends HOWARD’s Rolex watch box.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Take this back please.
EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING, QUEENS, NY - NIGHT
HOWARD moves through a crowd into a building.
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - AFTER
HOWARD sits next to DINA, his youngest son EDDIE, 7, looks like
a mini-Howard and oldest son BENI, 15, pimpled and gangly. BENI
plays a game on his iPhone.
The stage is decorated with amateurish mountain scenery. A
banner with the words ‘Snow White’ hangs from the ceiling.
HOWARD jokes around with EDDIE by tapping the MAN IN FRONT of
them on the shoulder. When The Man turns around HOWARD points to
the person a few seats over from him. EDDIE finds this
hysterical. HOWARD is his hero.
HOWARD
(to BENI)
What game is that?
BENI
(without looking up)
Knightmare Tower.
HOWARD
You set any records yet?
BENI
Yeah, 32nd rank in NY.
Out of 33.

HOWARD

BENI laughs. EDDIE leans over and taps HOWARD on his shoulder.
In jest, HOWARD, turns around, looks for who tapped him, but
instead notices TUNA, 30’s, stocky, and ROBERT, 40’s, oafish,
sitting by the aisle some 10 rows back. They look out of place.
They stare at HOWARD.
HOWARD looks away, waits a few seconds, and looks back. The two
men are still staring. HOWARD stands up.
DINA
Where you going?
HOWARD
Daddy’s gotta use the bathroom.
HOWARD gets up and moves down to the aisle.

57.
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - 10 ROWS BACK - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD approaches TUNA and ROBERT.
HOWARD
(whispering)
Do I know you?
TUNA
I don’t think so.
HOWARD
Then why are you staring at me?
Was I?

ROBERT

HOWARD
What’re you doing here?
ROBERT
We’re here to enjoy the play.
ROBERT laughs but with a fixed, menacing look at HOWARD, who
briskly walks towards the exits.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD makes a call as he walks down a hallway,
HOWARD
(into phone)
Jim, this isn’t right! My
daughter’s school, really?
ROBERT and TUNA appear in the hallway. HOWARD walks in the
opposite direction.
INT. ANOTHER SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD picks up his pace. He tries a few random doors. Locked.
ROBERT and TUNA turn the corner just as HOWARD finds an open
door and enters it.
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS
Costumed children wait by the side of the stage. Set pieces move
about. HOWARD crosses through the space. A TEACHER looks at him.
HOWARD
Wow! Everything looks fantastic!
Hearing his voice, MARCEL, 11, little girl version of DINA,
turns around.

58.
Daddy!

MARCEL

HOWARD
Baby! You’re going to kill them!
Before the TEACHER can respond, HOWARD has already exited the
room through a set of doors on the opposite side.
INT. SCHOOL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD scurries down steps to the basement. He rushes through a
labyrinthine maze of dark corridors until landing in the boiler
room.
INT. SCHOOL BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME
HOWARD squeezes himself behind the hot sooty boiler, burning his
arm in the process. A long pause.
Footsteps resound through the space, getting louder, then
stopping.
ROBERT (O.S.)
The faggot must have popped out
that other door.
TUNA (O.S.)
No, he’s in here.
HOWARD hears them move around the room, getting close to the
boiler. HOWARD, motionless, wedged behind the boiler, holds his
breath.
ROBERT (O.S.)
Ahhhh! My fucking hand.
TUNA (O.S.)
What happened?
ROBERT (O.S.)
I burned my fucking hand!
TUNA (O.S.)
Fuck this. We’ll wait out front.
HOWARD hears them drift into another part of the basement.
He opens his phone and sees a text from SADIE, “PLAY OVER YET?”
He replies, “Running late. See you at the after party”, but
there isn’t enough signal to send it. He manically tries to resend the message. Nothing.

59.
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
MARCEL (SNOW WHITE) is picking wild berries downstage stage when
the QUEEN, a young girl dressed as an old hag, approaches.
DINA checks her phone. Nothing.
QUEEN
Oh, hello fair young maiden.
Hello.

MARCEL

QUEEN
Care to share this apple with me?
MARCEL
I’m starving... but...
QUEEN
You needn’t worry... please have
this half.
MARCEL who skeptically accepts the apple and inspects it.
QUEEN (CONT’D)
(taking a bite)
Look, I’ll eat my half first. These
apples come from an ancient place,
making them the most delicious.
Convinced, MARCEL takes a bite as well.
MARCEL
Oh, it’s quite tasty.
She drops dead to the floor. The QUEEN laughs maniacally.
DINA looks incredibly irritated.
INT. SCHOOL BOILER ROOM - MUCH LATER
HOWARD readjusts himself, squinting in obvious discomfort, and
slips out from behind the boiler. He is reddened from the heat
and covered in soot and grease. He uses his cellphone to light
his way through the room.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTER
The hallways are empty. HOWARD makes his way to the exit doors.
They are locked.
HOWARD
Oh you gotta be fuckin’ kidding me.
The hall goes dark as Howard’s phone dies.

60.
HOWARD gropes around, tries a few classrooms, which are locked.
He returns the basement.
INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD rushes from sublevel window to sublevel window, pushing
on each, hoping for an opening. He finds a loose one, pulls a
few boxes over and climbs through it, barely fitting.
EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD emerges in the school playground. He runs over to the
gate. Locked. A pause. With some difficulty, he scales the
fence, ripping his pants in the process.
Fuck!

HOWARD

The moment his feet touch ground, a limo pulls up next to him.
A guy comes running out of it and whacks HOWARD in the back with
a mini baseball bat.
HOWARD shrieks and falls to the ground.
The window zips down to reveal JIM, 50s, wax-faced, heavy-set.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Jim, please I’m already very late.
I can’t be any more late, let me
go, then weJIM
Howard, get in the car.
INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD climbs in sits down between the ROBERT and TUNA, across
from JIM.
Look-

HOWARD

JIM
I don’t want to hear another word
from you.
HOWARD
You already have all my brother’s
stuff. You alreadyHOWARD is interrupted with a vicious chest punch from ROBERT.
JIM
Do you know now to listen?

61.
HOWARD
(winded)
That 65 grand you took from
Anthony, that was supposed to be
260, I was planning onROBERT jabs HOWARD in the head with a running electric razor,
shearing off a chunck of hair. HOWARD jerks forward and clutches
his head.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
What the fuck was that?!
HOWARD inspects his head in shock.
JIM
I’m offering you an out. You hear
me? You have til Wednesday to give
me 250 grand, and then we’ll call
it even. None of the interest.
We’ll be done with each other. You
won’t have to listen to me, I won’t
have to listen to you. But you’re
done. No more playing with me or
any of my guys. You’ve got 48 hours
to pay me in-full in-cash or then
it won’t be about the money anymore
and there won’t be any collecting.
(beat)
You understand that?
HOWARD
Can I speak now?
JIM
I just wanna hear yes or no. That’s
all. I’m offering you a big
discount to end this cat and mouse
shit.
HOWARD
Jim, with all due respect, I’d just
like to explain.
(waits for approval)
Please, just let me explain.
(beat)
I told you that a gem was arriving
this week. Well, it did. It’s
sitting on my desk in my office
right now. It completely drained me
of cash, but I have it. Precious
opals of this size go for 1, 2
grand a carat. It’s 600 carats!
It’s worth anywhere between 600 and
a mil and it’s up for auction next
week. Why you’re chasing me through
my kid’s school on a Thursday when
you can have your money in full on
a Tuesday is crazy to me. Crazy.

62.
JIM
(cynically)
So you were going to pay me the
full 250 on this coming Tuesday?
HOWARD
I’ll give you 300 for your troubles
on Tuesday, well on Thursday, cuzJIM
-See already you’re making excuses.
HOWARD
It’s not an excuse, if you let me
finish... the auction is on Monday
but I won’t see the funds unless
it’s a wire, but most likely I
won’t see it till later in the
week, but Wahler Loans will front
me if they see an auction ticket.
JIM listens without interest.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Look! If by next week you don’t
have your money, you can kill me!
I’ll deserve it.
JIM
I already said I’ll give you till
Wednesday. It makes no difference
to me how you get the money.
HOWARD
Fine, fine. Then we’re good!
There’s no problem!
JIM
Yes, between now and Wednesday
there’s no problem.
HOWARD refuses to acknowledge the menacing undercurrent.
HOWARD
Great! Look, you guys wanna roll
with me to Greenhouse? Meet Amare
Stoudemire? The rapper Privelej?
JIM
Are you asking me for a lift?
HOWARD
No, we all go. Into the city, to
Greenhouse. Have some drinks, sit
with Amare and Privelej. They’re my
friends. They have tons of pussy
with them always.
JIM
Where’s Greenhouse?

63.
HOWARD
On Varick, downtown.
JIM
You hear that Michael?
MICHAEL THE DRIVER
Greenhouse?
JIM
You wanna go in and get a drink?
MICHAEL THE DRIVER
And meet Amare Stoudemire? What do
you think?
JIM
Okay, we’ll go in with you.
EXT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT CLUB - AFTER THE CAR RIDE
A large crowd of YOUNG BLACK MEN and WOMEN push against velvet
ropes, all vying for the BOUNCER’S attention. HOWARD, MICHAEL
the driver and JIM approach. [Remember HOWARD looks like shit
and is now missing a piece of his hair].
HOWARD
Yo, my man, what’s happening?
HOWARD palms a $100 bill to the BOUNCER.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
AMARE’s expecting us.
BOUNCER
AMARE’s not here tonight.
JIM snorts.
HOWARD
Privelej though, right?
The BOUNCER unlocks the ropes, allows HOWARD in.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to JIM)
Come on, guys. What’d I tell you?
They enter the club.
INT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS
The nightclub is pumping. Scantily clad waitresses carry
champagne bottles with sparklers shooting out of them. The DJ
gives shout outs to VIPs in the club over blaring Hip Hop.
HOWARD and JIM are the only white people present.

64.
They snake their way through the room until HOWARD spies one of
AMARE’S BODYGUARDS standing at a banquette towards the back.
INT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT CLUB - BANQUETTE
HOWARD approaches BODYGUARD 1.
HOWARD
YO, WHAT’S UP.
BODYGUARD 1 gives HOWARD a pound, HOWARD walks past him and
approaches two blinged out, extremely cool looking young guys -KEV and PARIS -- who pass two blunts between them. HOWARD has to
scream at the top of his lungs to be heard.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
WHAT’S UP, WHERE’S PRIVELEJ AT?
KEV looks up at him. Blows smoke into his face.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I’M HOWARD, AMARE’S BOY, DEMANY

KEV
YEAH, HE’S HERE SOMEWHERE.
HOWARD
THIS IS MY BOY JIM AND HIS BOY.
PARIS

WHAT SHOULD I GET?
PARIS

HOWARD
HENNY VSOP FOR MY FRIENDS HERE.

JIM IS A G. TRUST ME.
WHAT UP!

PARIS

HOWARD
WHERE IS SHE?
DUNNO.

BODY GUARD 1

HOWARD
(to PARIS and KEV)
HAVE YOU SEEN A WHITE GIRL, YOUNG,
SHORT BANGS, DARK HAIR.
KEV and PARIS laugh. Exhale tons of weed smoke.
KEV
(laughing)
YEAH, I’VE SEEN HER.
HOWARD
WHERE IS SHE?
PARIS
BITCH HAS BLADDER PROBLEMS!
KEV laughs.
HOWARD
HAHA. What!?!
PARIS
I SAID THE BITCH HAS BLADDER
PROBLEMS!
HOWARD’s smile recedes.
HOWARD
(shouting to JIM)
I’LL BE RIGHT BACK.
INT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM HALLWAY
HOWARD sees TWO BIG MEN standing in front of the bathroom door.
He walks between them and bangs on it.
HOWARD
SADIE?! YOU IN THERE?
BIG MAN 1
YO, WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU
DOING?

66.
HOWARD
NO WORRIES. I NEED TO KNOW IF MY
GIRL IS IN THERE.
BIG MAN 1
YOU SEE IT’S IN USE.
HOWARD bangs on the door some more.
HOWARD
SADIE?!!! SADIE?!!!
BIG MAN 1 and 2 push HOWARD up against the wall.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
GET OFF ME YOU ANIMALS!
Suddenly, the door opens and PRIVELEJ appears, looking really
wasted and his pants are unbuckled. BIG MEN let go of HOWARD.
PRIVELEJ
WHAT’S UP? WHO WAS BANGING?
HOWARD
ME! I WAS BANGING!
HOWARD looks into the bathroom. SADIE sits on the sink,
underwear around her ankles. She looks beyond wasted, barely
able to keep her eyes open.
HOWARD lunges into PRIVELEJ, sending them both careening to the
bathroom floor. The BIG MEN grope to pull HOWARD up but the
floor is wet.
SADIE starts shrieking.
HOWARD is a maniac, flailing his arms and legs, throwing wild,
sloppy punches and kicks every which way. A few land on
PRIVILEJ, who is balled up, covering his head with his elbows.
Enough is enough. BIG MAN 1 and 2 lift HOWARD from the floor,
like he weighs nothing, and in a long tracking shot, carry him
through the club.
Along the way, they pass JIM and MICHAEL, who stare up in utter
disbelief.
BIG MAN 1 and 2, carry HOWARD down a grossly lit back hallway.
They kick open the metal doors to a service entrance and
violently toss HOWARD out to the street.
EXT. GREENHOUSE NIGHT CLUB - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
The metal doors slam shut. HOWARD gets up and pounds on them, to
no avail.

67.
HOWARD
YOU DIRTY MOTHER FUCKERS! YOU
FILTHY ANIMALS! YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO I AM! I’LL SUE YOU TIL YOU HAVE
NOTHING. I’LLThe doors re-open. DEMANY’s steps out and hands SADIE over to
the HOWARD.
DEMANY
Take your girl and get the fuck out
of here. Now.
The doors close.
HOWARD puts his head in his hands and has a 15 second ‘power
cry’. SADIE is too fucked up to respond.
INT. CAB - AFTER
HOWARD stares out the window in a silent rage. SADIE
continuously tries to press the “OFF” button on the Taxi-TV.
HOWARD swats her hand away and turns it off himself.
EXT. HOWARD’S BUILDING
The cab pulls up in front of Howard’s apartment. A DOORMAN
rushes to the curb and helps SADIE out. HOWARD remains inside.
HOWARD
Make sure she gets into the house.
(to driver)
Ho.
The cab drives HOWARD away.
EXT. DIAMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT
HOWARD walks down 47th street. It feels like a ghost town.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - BACKROOM - 145AM
HOWARD flips the lights on and throws his sports jacket onto his
desk. He pulls a blanket and a pillow from a cabinet and sets up
a makeshift bed on the floor.
CUT TO:
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - MORNING
An unkempt HOWARD talks on the phone. In a nearby plexiglass
enclosure, JUAN, a Mexican jewelry setter, is grinding stones.

68.
HOWARD
(into phone)
I’m sorry I can’t hear you. Hold
on.
(to NADAV)
Will you tell him to stop for a
minute!
NADAV pops up and bangs on the plexi.
Hey! Stop!

NADAV

JUAN stops.
HOWARD
(into phone)
I’m sorry...
HOWARD holds his tape dispenser as if it were the GEM.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Yeah, I’m looking at it right
now... It’s gorgeous. We’ve had it
for a few days now, it’s a
beautiful opal...
(listens)
I’ve been so busy-Would I have to
pay for the addendum? We still have
a few business days before the
auction, it could help... What
about on the Christies website, can
you add imagery of it if I got you
jpegs?
(looks at incoming call)
Oh my god. Mary... Mary, let me
call you right back, I have to take
this.
(answers other call)
Janet! Hi, yes, this is Howard
Nagy. Thank you for calling me backNo, I didn’t mean to worry you... I
just... Well, I saw online that you
represent Amare Stoudemire and I
really need- Yes, no problem. I’ll
wait.
BUZZZZZ! HOWARD looks up at the security monitor and see’s YUSSI
enter the SHOWROOM and march directly to HOWARD’S office.
YUSSI
(livid)
Jo wants to know where his red
cobra chain is.
HOWARD turns his back to YUSSI and waves him away.
No! Now!

YUSSI (CONT’D)

69.
HOWARD
CAN’T YOU SEE I’M BUSY!?!?
YUSSI
I just need you to tell me where
the chain is.
HOWARD
Oh for fuck’s sake! The cobra
chain? I sold it for 25 to Ray
Forecaster.
YUSSI
Fine. Then give me the money and
I’ll walk it down to him right now.
Not now!
Yes now!

HOWARD
YUSSI

HOWARD
You work for me not Jo!
(into phone)
HI! YES! Well, yes and no, it’s
only an emergency because of
time... Howard Nagy... No, I’m his
JewlerYUSSI slams his finger down and ends the call.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!?!
YUSSI
YOU’RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW! WHERE’S THE 25 GRAND!?!
HOWARD starts to redial.
HOWARD
I don’t have it right now. You can
tell Jo next week.
YUSSI swipes the phone off the desk.
YUSSI
I have 100 Rolexes coming this week
and without Jo I have no one to
front the costs. Are you going to
front the costs!?!?
HOWARD
Get the fuck out of my face.
YUSSI
Jo was gonna buy half of them.

70.
HOWARD
You shouldn’t be doing business
with that scumbag anyway.
YUSSI
And now he won’t have anything to
do with me because of my
relationship to you. So you know
what?! Now you’re gonna have to put
up the money for them.
HOWARD
Your stupid rolex hustle is a waste
of time- Get out of my office.
Fine...

YUSSI

YUSSI makes a beeline for the open safe behind HOWARD’S desk.
HOWARD bolts up and pulls YUSSI away.
HOWARD
Don’t you touch my stuff!
YUSSI
I’m taking my watches, I wanna have
them with me.
YUSSI pushes HOWARD aside. HOWARD leans forward.
YUSSI (CONT’D)
There’s only 4 watches in here,
where are the rest?
YUSSI keeps looking.
YUSSI (CONT’D)
Where the fuck are the rest?
HOWARD
They’re on loan.
YUSSI
Are you kidding me?
HOWARD
They’re a few hundred each. Gimme a
break.
YUSSI
They don’t belong to you!
NADAV
(interjects)
YUSSI! That’s enough! Get out!
YUSSI, full of rage stomps over to his desk and starts to pack
his things into a shoulder bag.

71.
YUSSI
I’m gonna call my sister and tell
her all about Sadie, Sara, the
money... everything.
Calling his bluff, HOWARD grabs the phone and extends it to
YUSSI, who in turn storms out of the BACKROOM.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
YUSSI makes his way past the showcases towards the exit.
HOWARD (O.S.)
(yells)
Oh, who’s a big boy!!
JOANI buzzes him out. He slams the door AS HARD AS HE CAN on his
way out. JOANI buzzes him through the second door, which he also
slams.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD
Yussi’s a BIG BOY!!!
NADAV
You alright Howard?
I’m fine.

HOWARD

NADAV reorders things around the room. On the INTERCOM:
JOANI (O.S.)
Sadie’s on the phone.
HOWARD
Tell her I’m not here. Tell her I
haven’t been in all day... NoHOWARD engages speakerphone.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Where are you?
SADIE (O.S.)
(very upset)
Just woke up, I feel like shit.
HOWARD
(sarcastic)
Ah, so you’re taking it easy today?
I’m sooo happy to hear that! I want
you to rest, be comfortable.
SADIE (O.S.)
Please Howard.

72.
HOWARD
It must be so nice to take a day
off whenever you feel like it.
What’s that like?
SADIE (0.S)
Howard, I feel horrible inside.
The other line rings.
HOWARD
No, it’s good, it’s good. Get your
beauty sleep. Take as much time off
as you need, meanwhile...
(sarcasm turns to anger)
The rest of us will continue to
work for your spoiled
unappreciative ass and keep this
fucking business afloatSADIE (O.S.)
All I want to do is see you, I just
thought you didn’t want to see me,
that’s why I didn’tINTERCOM interrupts:
JOANI (O.S.)
Knicks Player personnel on line 2.
HOWARD hangs up on SADIE and engages the other line.
HOWARD
This is Howard Nagy.
SPEAKER PHONE
Hello Mr. Nagy, how are you doin?
HOWARD
I’m not gonna lie, I could be
better. I’m in a situation with one
of your high profile players and
I’m about a moment away from making
things very ugly.
SPEAKER PHONE
Okay... can you hold for a second?
HOWARD
No, no, no. Do not put me on hold!
(listens to silence)
Look, I’m a very litigious
individual and I’m about a second
away from hanging up on you and
calling my lawyer, the police, and
then the press soon after. You’ll
be dealing with a much uglier
situation than I think you’d like
the public to know-

73.
SPEAKER PHONE
Sir, you need to calm down. I don’t
have any clue what you’re talking
about.
BUZZZZ! HOWARD looks to a security monitor and sees AMARE and
his TWO BODYGUARDS waiting in the hallway.
JOANI (O.S.)
AMARE’s here!
SPEAKER PHONE
Can you please give me your number
and I canHOWARD hangs up the phone and runs to the showroom.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
JOANI buzzes AMARE and his BODYGUARDS into the small holding
area between the two doors. AMARE waves hello at HOWARD through
the glass of the interior door. JOANI buzzes. It won’t open.
JOANI buzzes again. It still won’t open.
HOWARD
Open it, what’s going on?!
JOANI holds the buzzer down while BODY GUARD 1 yanks at it.
HOWARD runs around the showcases and up to the doors.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Try it again.
JOANI buzzes, HOWARD pushes hard. He kneels down and inspects
the lock.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Crap, it’s bent.
AMARE
(though glass)
What’s going on?
HOWARD
(yelling)
THE MAGNETIC RELEASE. IT’S NOT
CONNECTING WITH THE DOOR. HANG ON.
HOWARD tries to bend the release. JOANI joins HOWARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Shit, this is no good.
(loudly to AMARE)
AMARE! YOU GOT THE GEM ON YOU?
AMARE removes it from a bag and holds it up.

74.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Great. Look this might take a
minute. Go downstairs to Yuri’s for
a tea. I’ll come get you when this
is fixed.
BODY GUARD 1 pulls on the first door. It won’t budge either.
BODY GUARD 1
WHAT THE FUCK MAN!?!?
JOANI holds down the buzzer.

PULL HARD.

HOWARD

BODY GUARD 1 pulls hard on the door. Nothing.
JOANI
It’s not working because it thinks
the other one is engaged.
AMARE
(barely audible)
WHAT DO WE DO?!
HOWARD
FUCK!
(Beat)
OKAY, HANG TIGHT! 30% OFF ANYTHING
YOU GUYS WANT IN HERE! I SWEAR.
JOANI
(laughing)
I can’t believe this.
HOWARD
Nadav! See if you can fix this!
NADAV approaches the door.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Bend this frame back into place so
the two pieces of metal touch...
You see what I’m sayin?
NADAV
I think so.
HOWARD
(yelling to AMARE)
I’M SO SORRY GUYS!
BODY GUARD 1
IN 1 MINUTE I’M BREAKING IT DOWN.

75.
YOU CAN’T!

HOWARD

NADAV’s face contorts into a severe grimace as he tries to bend
the frame back into position.
NADAV
It’s impossible.
HOWARD grabs a phone and dials.
HOWARD
(into phone)
Tony... It’s Howard at KMA... Yeah,
the locks jammed... From the
inside... We tried that... Can you
just come and check it out. I got a
VIP stuck in there.
HOWARD hangs up, and dials ELAN.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(into phone)
ELAN! Stop what you’re doing and
run to the hardware store and buy a
sledgehammer.
JOANI lights up a cigarette. HOWARD takes a drag from it.
HOWARD (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
Then bring it here, but wait
outside on the street... Oh, and
make sure we can return it.
EXT. 47TH STREET BETWEEN 6TH AND 5TH, DIAMOND DISTRICT - AFTER
ELAN rushes down the block with the sledgehammer in hand. He
arrives in front of HOWARD’S building when he hears faint:
HOWARD (O.S.)
ELAN! HEY ELAN!
ELAN looks around, confused.
UP HERE!

HOWARD, NADAV & JOANI

ELAN looks up and sees them.
EXT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - OUT WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD
Someone dial ELAN’s cell.
JOANI picks up the phone and dials ELAN. She hands the phone out
the window to HOWARD. HOWARD watches ELAN look for his phone.

76.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(looking at ELAN)
Hey-I’m gonna lower this twine
down. Untie the dumbbell and very,
very securely... you hear me, VERY
securely... tie the rope around the
hammer... Yeah, now... and don’t
hang up, just put me in your
pocket.
HOWARD lowers the twine with the dumbbell attached. ELAN
receives the rope and dumbbell and ties it to the hammer. HOWARD
cautiously raises it back up. Half-way up, the sledgehammer
catches on a piece of concrete moulding. It sways wildly and
cracks a window on the 3rd floor.
Shit.

HOWARD (CONT’D)

HOWARD continues to pull on the rope until the sledgehammer is
in his hands. He jumps back inside.
NADAV
Want me to do it?
No.

HOWARD

HOWARD enters the showroom. JOANI, and NADAV follow.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - DAY
HOWARD smiles as he shows AMARE the sledgehammer. AMARE and CO
are now seated and covered in sweat.
HOWARD
I’M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS AMARE! 30%
OFF FOR YOUR BOYS. ANYTHING IN THE
SHOP.
HOWARD positions himself. He takes a swing at the door. WHACK!
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to JOANI)
Okay, try it.
JOANI buzzes. Nothing. HOWARD whacks wildly, to no avail.
Lemme.

NADAV

HOWARD hands it to NADAV, who starts hitting the door very hard.
HOWARD has an idea. He runs to the back room and reappears
seconds later with metal shavings and a screwdriver.
HOWARD
(to NADAV)
Enough. Get out of the way.
(MORE)

77.
HOWARD (CONT'D)
(to self)
Waste that money on the hammer...
HOWARD crouches down and shoves the metal shavings into an
opening in the door frame.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Okay, try it.
JOANI presses the buzzer. It engages. HOWARD opens the door.
AMARE and CO stand up and exit the vestibule.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Oh my god, AMARE, I’m so sorry.
AMARE
That was horrible, Howard.
BODY GUARD 1
I’m in the mind to break that
fucking showcase over you head.
AMARE silences the BODYGUARD with a look.
HOWARD
JOANI, give them a glass of water
and for them(looks to BODY GUARDS)
20% off... Lemme just see if this
works now.
HOWARD enters the vestibule and lets the doors close behind him.
JOANI buzzes. The doors work.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Voila!
(to AMARE)
Okay, back to business. You’re not
an easy man to get a hold of. But
when I do, I really do, huh?
AMARE
I’m sorry but I don’t feel very
humorous at this time, Howard.
HOWARD
Alright, lemme see the gem.
AMARE removes the GEM from an inside pocket. He delicately
extends it to HOWARD.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You know, I forgot what it even
looked like... I had only seen it
the one time...
AMARE
It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve
ever has. It feels important.
(MORE)

78.
AMARE (CONT'D)
Howard, do you know what I mean
when I say ‘important’?
HOWARD
Of course. That was a legendary
performance the other night.
JOANI hands AMARE a bottled water.
AMARE
Thank you. I’m feeling better.
(to HOWARD, quietly)
Do you think we could talk in
private?
HOWARD
Sure, let’s go to my office.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD walks to his desk, AMARE ducks down to clear the doorway.
AMARE
Howard, this stone means a lot to
me. Importance is a feeling that
comes from within. Most people
think the opposite.
Morons.

HOWARD

AMARE
This stone does something for me.
With it, I feel a connection to the
ground and, hence, the sky and of
course to the cosmos. It’s very
important to me.
HOWARD
I can tell you feel that way.
AMARE
I want to buy it.
HOWARD
Okay. How much is it worth to you?
AMARE
I have $175,000 cash with me.
HOWARD
(laughing)
Amare, buddy. I’m sorry, this stone
is worth a helluva lot more than
that.

79.
AMARE
And Court-side seats for the rest
of the season. That’s easily a 50
thousand dollar value. You could
sell each and every ticket.
HOWARD
Normally I wouldn’t give a shit.
I’d give it to you for free. But
it’s all a bit messy right now. I’m
stuck in a hole and to be honest,
my life is being threatened on a
nightly basis. I only tell you this
to emphasize why I’m obligated to
sell this gem for the most money I
can get.
AMARE
(interrupting)
This is a lot of money for me.
HOWARD
You make millions of dollars.
AMARE
It’s not what you think. I get paid
in stipends. People hold onto a lot
my cash. A lot of it is tied up in
investments. This is a number I can
do. Plus, I’ll post a picture of
you once a week on my Instagram.
HOWARD
You’re not understanding me.
AMARE grows angry but then controls himself.
AMARE
I feel like I’m being very fair.
It’s an honest price for a gem of
this kind.
HOWARD feels conflicted.
HOWARD
Look, it’s already listed with
Christies. If it means that much to
you, you’re free to attend and bid
on the item like everyone else. Who
knows, you could get it for 175
there. I doubt it but I haven’t
even had the thing appraised yet.
AMARE
When is the auction?
Monday.

HOWARD

80.
AMARE
Okay, fair enough. But you will let
me hold onto it until the auction
date. I have a game tonight and two
on the road, one in Cleveland and
one in Atlanta. I can have it back
by Sunday.
HOWARD
(laughing)
Amare, buddy, I have a million
things to do with it before the
auction, including, like I said,
getting it appraised.
AMARE stands up.
AMARE
You’re saying no again.
HOWARD
I’m sorry. I can’t. I just can’t.
Maybe if your game on Saturday was
at home... maybe JUST MAYBE, but
even then...
AMARE walks back to the showroom.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
AAAAH AMARE! Don’t be like that!
BUZZZZZ!
AMARE (O.S.)
I’m not gonna get stuck in there
again, will I?!
JOANI (O.S.)
No. I don’t think so.
BUZZZZ! HOWARD looks up to the security monitors and watches
AMARE leave KMA and head towards the elevators. The elevator
doors open and SADIE exits as AMARE and his BODYGUARDS enter.
Upon seeing SADIE, HOWARD quickly throws on his sports coat,
places the gem in the front pocket and dashes out of his office.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- SHOWROOM
HOWARD jets around the showcase.
HOWARD
(to JOANI)
I’m going to Aren’s at G.I.A, Close
up without me.
BUZZZZZ! HOWARD leaves.

81.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD opens the door to the hallway, coming face to face with
SADIE. Her face is splotchy and puffy. BEFORE SHE CAN SAY
ANYTHING, HOWARD waves a finger in her face.
NO!

HOWARD

HOWARD rushes down the hallway. She runs after him.
SADIE
Howard, I’m sorry, what do you want
me to do, I want to die.
Good, die.

HOWARD

HOWARD pushes the elevator button.
SADIE
But you told me to come in!
HOWARD laughs loudly.
SADIE (CONT’D)
Please, Howard! It was a mistake, I
was fucked up, I’m sorry!
HOWARD
I don’t give a shit.
SADIE tries to get into his field of vision.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
If I wanted to look at you, I
would.
The elevator doors open. HOWARD gets in, SADIE tries to enter.
HOWARD violently pushes her out.
Stay out!

HOWARD (CONT’D)

SADIE starts crying. The doors close.
INT. CHRISTIES AUCTION HOUSE BACK ROOM - DAY
AREN, a plump man, Jewish, late 40s, examines the gem with a wet
grinder. He dries it off, re-wets it and holds it up to a light.
HOWARD
Incredible, huh?
With a digital caliper AREN measures it’s size, then weighs it.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Can you believe that was noodled?!

82.
AREN
Sure I can.
AREN sends light through the stone and checks its refraction.
AREN (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
Well it’s certainly not the
harlequin multi color black
precious you said it was.
HOWARD
What? What do you mean, what’s
wrong with it? It’s harlequin!
AREN
Look, it’s got a basic pin-fire
pattern...
HOWARD
No, no, noAREN
(looks deeper)
Limited in color...
HOWARD
That’s a crock of shit. I had the
thing under dull lighting and saw
full spectrum.
AREN
It won’t face up across it’s
largest dimension...
HOWARD
What’s that mean? I’m not an opal
guy.
AREN
It means even with the best cutter,
you won’t get it to fully face
upright. It will undulate.
HOWARD
Okay, fine, so we’re looking at
what? a ‘G’ a carat?
AREN
It’s not even as dark as true black
should be, like you had told us.
HOWARD
It’s black as night. And the thing
is skin to skin.
AREN
But it isn’t... Maybe it’ll yield
30-40%. Look, you know noodled
opals are a gamble. Why you didn’t
tell Steven this is beyond me.

83.
HOWARD
Steven was doing me a favor. I saw
pictures, it was windowed for us
there. It’s from Welo!
AREN
I don’t know about that. Welo opals
aren’t this big-and I’m seeing that
there very well could be a flaw or
two, looks like a grain of sand
about a mil deep, there are a lot
of notches.
HOWARD
The thing’s gorgeous! I could get
650 for it in an hour.
AREN
I’m sorry Howard, I can’t appraise
it at that. We’ve already estimated
this at 750 to a mil.
HOWARD
Okay, let’s keep it at that.
AREN
You kidding me? I’d lose my GIA
certification.
(looking at gem)
We can say the 175 to 250 range.
Start bidding at 100.
HOWARD paces about.
HOWARD
175!?! Fuck this. I’m gonna bring
it to Carol’s, she’s certified and
knows a lot more bout opals than
you do, she’s already seen it.
HOWARD’s phone rings. He silences it without looking at it.
AREN
Then she told you the same thing.
C’mon Howard, I have no reason to
lie to you. You gotta hope for a
collector, a jeweler won’t even
take this on most likely.
HOWARD
But it’s beautiful.
HOWARD’s phone rings and again he silences it.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
If people see it up close they’ll
bid through the roof. Can’t we show
a video of what it looks like
inside?

84.
AREN
Won’t matter. They’re gonna
withdraw it.
HOWARD
Let me deal with Steven. He won’t
pull it. Can you guys do the video?
HOWARD’s phone rings again. This time he takes it out of his
pocket. On the caller ID it says, “DINA.”
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Oh shit. Shabbat.
INT. GOOEY’S - PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
HOWARDS distant cousin GOOEY, fat, perfectly clean shaven, sits
at the head of a formal dining table. The table is set for
Shabbos; candles, challa bread, wine, etc.
His home is expansive, rooms beyond view, expensive artwork and
decor.
Next to GOOEY is RAQUEL, his wife, an olive skinned trophy wife,
his son EDMOND, 14, chubby, bratty, braces, GINA, 9, his
daughter, a princess, NICKI, 15. The men wear yarmulkes.
On HOWARD’s side sit DINA, EDDIE, BENI and MARCEL. The two
families look related.
GOOEY recites a Hebrew prayer, dips a ripped piece of challah
bread in salt and violently throws a piece to each person at the
table; a Sephardic tradition. HOWARD’S phone rings in his
pocket. He immediately silences it without looking at it.
HOWARD notices a painting above the fireplace. A gradient of
color that resembles a sunset.
HOWARD
Is that new, I don’t remember you
guys having that up last time we
were here.
RAQUEL
When were you guys here last?
DINA
7 months ago.
HOWARD phone vibrates again, the vibration is audible. HOWARD
silences it.
Dad!

EDDIE

The kids fight over iphone games and pick at their food. MAIDS
come in and out throughout the meal.

85.
RAQUEL
That’s too long.
Dad!
What baby?

EDDIE
HOWARD

EDDIE
Beni isn’t sharing.
HOWARD
(to BENI, very serious)
Give him the phone or I throw it in
the garbage.
BENI dutifully hands phone to EDDIE.
GOOEY
That’s an Alex Israel. Jewish kid
in Los Angeles making lots of money
right now.
RAQUEL
They’re colors from his dreams!
Stupid.

GOOEY

RAQUEL
What’re they then?
GOOEY pulls an Ipad up and opens some files. He finds the piece
of art they’re talking about, reads about it.
RAQUEL (CONT’D)
Rene got it for us for nothing. But
now they go for like 1 to 200, that
one there is about 125.
DINA
I don’t get it.
HOWARD’S phone vibrates again. HOWARD immediately silences it.
GOOEY
(reading)
They are replicas of backdrops from
movie sets in Hollywood studios,
he’s from Los Angeles so the movie
industry is important for him.
(looking up)
You see, it’s not what you said.
HOWARD
Will you guys excuse me for a
second.

86.
HOWARD gets up. DINA issues a disproving look as he walks out of
the room.
INT. GOOEY’S - PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - HALLWAY TO DINING ROOM
HOWARD immediately pulls the phone out, “SADIE” appears on the
caller-ID. He answers it.
HOWARD
(into phone)
What are you doing!?! You know
where I am, why are you calling me
like this?
SADIE (O.S.)
(in tears)
Why are you doing this to me?
HOWARD turns into the first open doorway.
INT. GOOEY’S - PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - CHILDRENS BEDROOM
HOWARD enters a children’s bedroom, lavishly decorated to look
like a city playground, with monkey-bars installed on the walls.
SADIE (O.S.)
I fucked up. I know I fucked up. I
don’t even remember what happenedNo, I guess I wouldn’t.
HOWARD
It’s Shabbos! What do you want?
SADIE (O.S.)
I just want talk to you for a
minute.
HOWARD
I don’t have anything to say to
you. I’m here having dinner and
after I’m going to enjoy a nice
peaceful weekend with my family
away from your poison.
SADIE (O.S.)
You don’t have to say anything,
just give me a minute, please.
HOWARD
Okay you have 60 seconds...
Silence.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
This counts.

87.
SADIE collects herself, breathes deep. After a long pause:
SADIE (O.S.)
I hate myself. You can’t hate me
more than I hate myself. I-I-I hate
that I am this way... Shit, I had
it in my head perfect...
HOWARD
You sound like televsion.
SADIE (O.S.)
Okay, ok, I know, I’m a piece a
shit, I’m a slut, I’m a no-good-lowlife who deserves nothing but the
street.
HOWARD
If you were sorry you would have
been in the office this morning
with coffee and flowers before I
even got up. Do you know how messed
up my back is today from sleeping
on that chair? My back is in so
much pain. You caused that pain.
SADIE (O.S.)
I know. I don’t want to cause you
any pain any more... I think maybe
what we need is for me to give you
some space. I can move out
temporarily.
HOWARD
You can move out for good!
SADIE (O.S.)
If that’s what you want.
HOWARD looks at the time.
HOWARD
Yes. Out. By 10pm tonight. Are we
done?
HOWARD throws his phone against an oversized pillow shaped like
a pigeon.
INT. GOOEY’S - PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - DEN - DURING
HOWARD sits at the edge of a plush couch in a rich velvety den.
GOOEY makes him a drink. ESPN plays basketball recaps on the TV.
HOWARD
Make it louder.
GOOEY raises the volume with an IPAD remote.

88.
SPORTSCASTER (O.S.)
AMARE needs help. You gotta learn
to keep yourself in check.
Sportscenter footage of a distressed AMARE swatting a cup of
Gatorade off a courtside desk and accidentally spraying fans.
AMARE apologizes profusely. The graphic reads, “Hero to Zero.”
GOOEY
So hot one night and so cold the
next.
SPORTSCASTER (O.S.)
AMARE Stoudemire, 3 for 17...
SPORTCASTER 2 (O.S.)
And they’re hitting him with single
coverage, it’s not the defense.
SPORTCASTER (O.S.)
It’s like the boiler broke.
SPORTCASTER 2 (O.S.)
Call the super!
HOWARD grabs the remote and makes it even louder: SPORTSCENTER
shows AMARE shirtless after the game in front of his locker.
AMARE
I just couldn’t hit my rhythm.
NEWSDAY REPORTER
You couldn’t hit anything compared
to last game. Is it the elbows?
AMARE
My elbows feel fine... I didn’t
have a good game and I take full
responsibility.
AMARE looks tortured on TV.
HOWARD
Fuckin’ guy tried to steal an opal
from me.
What?!

GOOEY

HOWARD
Yeah, I lent it to him the night he
had that crazy game. Fuckin
schvartza gave me a heart attack.
GOOEY
What did you do? Call the cops?

89.
HOWARD
No, I knew he’d turn up. He just
got carried away. I know his people
really well. They wouldn’t do me
like that.
GOOEY
What did he say?
HOWARD
He thinks that the stone gives him
special powers.
Really?!

GOOEY

HOWARD
I believe it! He was possessed. You
saw his performance.
GOOEY
What kind of stone is it?
HOWARD
Precious black opal, insane color
spectrum in harlequin pattern...
top notch, HUGE! You get lost in
it.
GOOEY laughs.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
He wants the stone but was lowballing me on the price, offering
175. Stormed out after I told him
to try his luck at the auction.
GOOEY
What do you think it will go for?
HOWARD
Honestly, I think it could go for
600, I don’t see why not.
GOOEY
What’s it value?
HOWARD
1st appraisal was low and I don’t
have time to get a 2nd one.
GOOEY
What was it?
HOWARD
Eh, they appraised it around a
quarter.
GOOEY
And he offered 175?

90.
HOWARD
Yeah listen Gooey, lemme ask you a
favor.
GOOEY
Oh boy, what?
HOWARD
Come to the auction Monday at
Christies, they know you there.
Make a few bidsGOOEY
Absolutely not.
HOWARD
I’m not talking about a lot, just
ensure that it gets to 250.
GOOEY
And if I win at 250?
HOWARD
Then I give it right back to you.
GOOEY
You know I resent being put in this
position.
HOWARD
Look at the guy.
AMARE looks destroyed on TV.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
He’s gonna overpay. Trust me.
GOOEY
If it were Southeby’sHOWARD
20%. I’ll give you that off his
final price.
GOOEY
I’ll do it for 30%.
HOWARD
20% is fair.
GOOEY
But I’m the one with the
reputation.
HOWARD looks at highlights they show of AMARE’s peak performance
game. AMARE celebrating.

INT. HOWARD AND DINA’S FAMILY CAR - NIGHT
HOWARD sits behind the wheel of his family’s BMW SUV. EDDIE
plays an iphone game called “Make it Rain,” where the object is
to flip through enough money as you can. BENI/MARCEL crowd over
EDDIE.
DINA surveys Instagram in the front seat.
HOWARD sees that it’s 10:15 on the car’s clock.
DINA
Why you going down 5th?
HOWARD
I need to grab something from the
apartment.
EXT. HOWARD’S BUILDING - AFTER
HOWARD pulls the BMW up to his building. A DOORMAN approaches
the car.
DOORMAN
Anything in the trunk, Mr. Nagy?
HOWARD
No, I’m just popping up for a
second.
DINA and their children watch HOWARD enter the lobby.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE - AFTER
The door flies open. SADIE sits relaxed on the couch in a robe.
HOWARD sees her and bursts into a rage.
HOWARD
It’s half past 10 and you’re laying
around watching television?!?!
SADIE stares at him. He runs to the counter and rummages through
SADIE’s handbag till he finds her set of keys.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I’ll tell you this!
He removes the house keys from her key ring and pockets them.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Now the next time you close this
door behind you it’ll be the last
time!
HOWARD slams the door closed. LOUDLY. Seconds later the door
flies open again. HOWARD runs back into the apartment and makes
his way to the bedroom.

92.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I decided I’ll pack up for you.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD throws the closet doors open, SADIE watches from the
doorway. HOWARD grabs a suitcase from the closet and tosses it
onto the floor. He then pulls random armfuls of clothing from
the wardrobe and shoves them into the suitcase.
HOWARD
(to self/her)
You wanna go fuck black guys in the
nasty bathrooms of their clubs, GO!
Suck black dick, fuck black dick! I
gotta live my life and...
Howard...

SADIE

HOWARD grabs a bunch of shoes and throws them onto the floor,
walks over to a dresser, pulls a full drawer out of the unit and
dumps it into the suitcase.
HOWARD
Please, go! Go, stuff your little
pussy with their big black dicks,
What? I don’t fuck you nice enough?
SADIE
You’re being ridiculous!
He squeezes the suitcase closed, zips it up and rolls it out of
the bedroom.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD rolls the suitcase towards the front door.
HOWARD
I’ll leave this with the doorman,
I’m gonna tell them to throw it in
the garbage out back if you don’t
come down with two others just like
it in the next hour or so.
SADIE
Are you coming back?
HOWARD leaves the apartment, slams the door.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT - BUILDING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD rolls the suitcase to the elevator. He then opens the
door to an adjacent stairwell and hides the suitcase behind a
trash can.

93.
INT. HOWARD AND DINA’S FAMILY CAR - NIGHT
HOWARD gets back in the car.
DINA
(icy)
Did you get what you wanted?
Yes.

HOWARD

Howard falls silent, starts the engine and drives away.
EXT. STREET IN SUBURBAN QUEENS, FOREST HILLS - AFTER
The BMW drives down a tree-lined street of oversized garish
homes crammed onto small properties. The car pulls into a
driveway and cuts the engine.
INT. HOWARD AND DINA’S FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS
The NAGY family pile out of the car and ascend a decadent stone
staircase.
DINA
(to HOWARD)
Pull the recycling out before you
come in.
HOWARD walks around to the side of the house, grabs a blue bin
and slowly drags it to the curb. Lights turn on inside the house
illuminating his movements.
When the chore is done, HOWARD shuffles up the stairs and enters
his home.
INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - AUCTION FLOOR - AFTER
An AUCTIONEER, an Indian man, 40’s, British accent, stands at a
podium spouting off information about a collection of ruby
encrusted necklaces. Above him, large TV’s show the necklaces in
detail. Prices are tracked and translated into other currencies
on a second monitor. Each side of the room is lined with manned
telephones. The general public and registered bidders sit with
paddles and books in rows of chairs.
Sitting in the front is GOOEY, flipping through the auction
catalogue.
Several rows back sit one of AMARE’S BODY GUARDS and a welldressed white woman in her mid-30’s, Amare’s PERSONAL ASSISTANT.
Seated in the back are JIM and ROBERT.
HOWARD stands by the side of the room, also flipping through the
auction catalogue.

94.
The ruby necklaces go to bidder in the back. The system moves on
to the next item. Images of the Opal appear on the big screen.
Curtains open and a MODEL in a formal dress appears, holding the
gem on a pillowed cushion.
AUCTIONEER
Before we move onto item number 38,
we have a formal statement from
Christies to announce, an apology.
(reads from paper)
Those of you in attendance for our
next item for auction, Item #38 a
600 carat precious black opal from
Lightning Ridge, Australia, please
accept our sincerest apologies. We
recently learned that the opal is
in fact from the Welo mines in
Ethiopia and estimated, not in the
$750,000 to million range, but
$155,000 to $225,000.
(off script)
Under normal circumstances we would
pull such an item, but we do feel
that the gem is still a unique,
exquisite specimen.
A close up of the HOWARD’S gem is projected above.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
As you can see the rough opal has
been windowed on either side.
Before even being cut you can see a
dazzling array of color in the
classic pin-fire pattern that, with
the right cutter, could yield up to
50 or 60%. There seem to be a few
recorded totches on the backside
and cutting needs to be precise if
that is the intention of the buyer.
Let’s open this at $40,000.
Amare’s PERSONAL ASSISTANT starts the bidding off, raising her
paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
We have 40 grand, can we see 50?
A random MALE BIDDER 189 in the back raises his paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
50 to the gentleman in the back,
(to AMARE’S PEOPLE)
65, Do we have 65?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT raises her paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
65,000, 65,000, do you want 75?
MALE BIDDER 189 raises his and announces:

95.
85.

MALE BIDDER 189

AUCTIONEER
85, Do you want 95?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT responds.
100,000.

BODY GUARD 1

AUCTIONEER
We have 100.
(to MALE BIDDER)
Would you give us 110?
The MALE BIDDER doesn’t move.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
105, sir? 105?
MALE BIDDER still despondent.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
Do we have 110? Anyone, 110?
GOOEY raises his paddle. The AUCTIONEER is elated to see GOOEY’S
participation.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
110 to Mr. Dabba, nice to see you.
GOOEY nods.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
(to PERSONAL ASSISTANT)
Will you go to 125?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT raises her paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
We have 125, Mr. Dabba, 135?
GOOEY raises his paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
135! 135, 135, do we have 150? 150?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT raises her paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
150, great, 160?
GOOEY raises paddle.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
160! 170? Will you see 170?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT raises her paddle.

96.

175.

BODY GUARD 1
(shouts)

AUCTIONEER
175! Nice advance. Mr. Dabba, 190?
The crowds murmurs. JIM seems content. GOOEY looks to HOWARD,
pauses, and raises his paddle.
190!

AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)

(to PERSONAL ASSISTANT)
Will you do 200? Take us there!
PERSONAL ASSISTANT talks quietly to BODY GUARD 1, who is clearly
urging her to go higher.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
200 to counter Mr. Dabba? 200?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT is clearly reluctant.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
Will it be 200?
PERSONAL ASSISTANT shakes her head no. BODYGUARD 1 looks
annoyed. HOWARD looks on in shock. GOOEY looks panicked. JIM and
ROBERT look pleased.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
No? Okay, 200 to the room? 200?
(looks to room)
Anybody, 200 for the 600 carat
Opal... A great addition to any
gemologist’s collection. 200,000
dollars? It’s undervalued at 190.
Do we have 200?
Silence from the room.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
Okay, we’re gonna go to Mr. Dabba
for 190 then. 190 going once, 190
twice.
AUCTIONEER bangs his gavel.
AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
Sold to Mr. Dabba for 190,000
dollars. Thank you Mr. Dabba.
Weak applause spreads through the room. GOOEY reluctantly
responds with a quick wave. Amare’s retinue stand up and leave
the room.
HOWARD tries to head them off by the exit but can’t get to them
in time. GOOEY walks past HOWARD, actively avoiding contact.

97.
INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTER
GOOEY casually walks up to HOWARD in the hallway.
GOOEY
(livid)
190!?!
HOWARD
What can I say? I was wrong.
GOOEY
So now what!?!
HOWARD
(looking over his
shoulder)
Control yourself. Not here.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(whispering)
I told you, once the money clears
into my account I’ll wire it right
back to you.
GOOEY
Including Christie’s 12%?
HOWARD
That comes out of my pocket,
naturally... I just need a few
weeks on that.
GOOEY
That’s nearly 25 grand!
Shhhh!

HOWARD

Christie’s manager, LLOYD, Asian, 40’s, effeminate, stops them.
LLOYD
Mr. NAGY, Mr. Dabba, can I see you
gentlemen in my office.
HOWARD
Can this wait? We’re in a rush.
LLOYD
I’m sorry. This will only take a
minute of your time.
INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - LLOYD’S OFFICE
LLOYD enters his office, GOOEY and HOWARD right behind him. The
second the door closes:

98.
LLOYD
You both know our policy on shill
biddingHOWARD
Shill bid-- What the hell are you
talking about?
LLOYD
There’s no negotiation, I’m sorry.
You’re both banned from Christies.
HOWARD
So a friend isn’t allowed to buy a
stone of mine through auction??!
GOOEY
I do a lot of business here!
LLOYD
We are well aware of that Mr.
Dabba, which makes this even more
unpleasant.
GOOEY
You gotta be kidding me?!
HOWARD
Proof! I demand proof!!!
EXT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - 49TH ST - AFTER
HOWARD and GOOEY leave the building. GOOEY is beyond upset.
HOWARD holds a purple wooden box containing the gem. They are
immediately approached by JIM and ROBERT.
JIM
Congratulations Howard!
HOWARD
(to self)
Shit.
JIM
(to GOOEY)
Congrats to you, sir. You mind if
we had a minute alone with Howard?
GOOEY
(storming off)
You can have him.
HOWARD
Ah, come on!
JIM
Okay, so what’s next?

99.
HOWARD
Look, shit, I don’t know how to
tell you this but, yeah, the bid
was disqualified. It doesn’t count.
JIM
(laughing)
Is this a joke?
HOWARD
I wish. That guy who just left,
he’s a friend. We were trying to
drive the price up on Amare andROBERT
(deadly serious)
I don’t want to hear it.
HOWARD
Wait, wait. Before you jump to
conclusions, ask me why I don’t
look worried?
JIM
Cut the bullshit, Howard. I’m not
interested.
HOWARD
I’m not worried because I have the
option of selling it to Amare
directly. He already offered me 175
in cash for the opal just the other
day.
JIM
You’re telling me you had 175 grand
in front of you recently and said
no?
HOWARD
Well, it wasnt that simple. I had
an agreement to auction with
Christie’s. You have any idea what
kind of penalties they charge for a
last minute cancellation?
JIM
Call AMARE. Right now.
HOWARD
No problem!
HOWARD pulls his phone out. Scrolls through his contacts.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
You saw his people bidding...

100.
JIM
Put it on speaker. I want to hear
him say 175.
HOWARD activates the speaker, awaits rings: The call is sent to
Demany’s voicemail: the excerpt of Biggie’s ‘Gimme One More
Chance’
VOICEMAIL
Biggie, gimme me one more chance...
BEEP.
HOWARD
(into phone)
Amare! Baruch hashem. Was really
hoping to see your face today. As
I’m sure you’ve heard by now, the
gem went to a higher bidder. Turns
out, there’s been a mix up and if
you want it, it’s yours for 175,
just like you offered. I’m telling
you it’s yours. Call me
immediately.
HOWARD hangs up.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
He’ll call back. When he does, I’ll
set this up for tomorrow morning.
He’ll come with cash, you’ll have
your money tomorrow, I promise.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - AFTERNOON
In a thick steam cloud, HOWARD cleanses himself with a hot
shower. It’s all gonna be okay. Everything. SADIE enters.
Howard?

SADIE

HOWARD doesn’t answer. SADIE makes her way to the shower, opens
the curtain. HOWARD turns around and sees SADIE naked.
HOWARD
No, No, no, I don’t want that now.
Please...

SADIE

HOWARD
(closing the curtain)
I said no!
Fine.

SADIE (O.S.)

With closed eyes, HOWARD starts to massage shampoo into his
hair.

101.
SADIE picks up another shampoo bottle and gets up on the toilet
seat, so she can reach over the shower curtain.
She waits for HOWARD to start rinsing the shampoo out of his
hair. She then proceeds to pour more shampoo onto his head,
making it impossible for him to finish rinsing. For the next 30
seconds, he rinses, she pours, until...
HOWARD
What the fucking-!?!
SADIE laughs and squeezes out the rest of the shampoo.
Ahhhhh!

HOWARD (CONT’D)

SADIE laughs louder, HOWARD squints his eyes open and sees
SADIE’s hand dangling above him.
SADIE!

HOWARD (CONT’D)

HOWARD rips the shower curtain to the side, still with tons of
suds in his hair, though now he has a FULL ERECTION!
HOWARD’s cell phone rings from the other room.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
My phone! Hand me that towel!
SADIE hands him a towel coyly. He wraps it around him and hops
out of the bathroom.
INT. HOWARD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Dripping wet, HOWARD runs into the bedroom and grabs his phone.
HOWARD
(into phone)
This is Howard... Ah, Amare!
HOWARD breathes a sigh of great relief and lies down on the bed.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I have to say, it brings me great
joy to hear from you... I know,
it’s all so confusing... Yes,
Though I’m really sorry that it
played out this way.
The bedroom door slowly opens. SADIE enters. Rather than look at
her, HOWARD fixes his gaze on the ceiling. She lays down next to
him and awaits eye contact.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(into phone, still calm)
No, this is right. You’re the
rightful owner...
(MORE)

102.
HOWARD (CONT'D)
It’s better this way... Do you
think you can make it tomorrow
morning with the cash... okay,
how’s the afternoon for you? 4pm is
perfect...
SADIE begins to caress HOWARD. He ignores it the best of his
ability. She begins to kiss his chest, moving down slowly.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to SADIE, whispering)
Stop it.
(back into phone)
No, I’m well aware of the
significance of the number... 175
is Abraham’s number... Well, they
say- no, no you’re right, I know...
it’s true, he lived to 175...
SADIE undoes HOWARD’s towel. HOWARD listens to AMARE, while
SADIE sucks him off.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(into phone, very calm)
No you’re right, like when God told
Abraham to leave his land.... we
all need to sacrifice... The ‘6’
for the male to the ‘4’ for the
female?
Overhead shot of bed.
EXT. 47TH STREET BETWEEN 6TH & 5TH, DIAMOND DISTRICT - NEXT DAY
HOWARD moves through the district sipping from a cup of coffee.
As he nears the entrance to his building he notices Jim’s driver
MICHAEL and ROBERT standing in the front of a parked Mercedes.
HOWARD approaches.
HOWARD
Hey fellas- So, We’re all set.
AMARE said he’ll be here by 4.
A back window rolls down, revealing JIM.
JIM
Yeah we know, my friend Nico is
upstairs waiting already.
HOWARD
You think he wants something? I was
gonna go to the deli on the corner
for a coffee... This one’s done.
He’s good.

JIM

INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - BACKROOM - AFTER
BUZZ! The security monitor shows AMARE and BODY GUARD 2 standing
in the hallway. HOWARD stands at his desk next to NADAV. A
second BUZZ!
From the showroom AMARE calls to HOWARD:
AMARE
Shall I come back there?
HOWARD
Come on in. How was the shootaround?
AMARE
Very refreshing.
BODY GUARD 2 sits down next to NICO, short, stocky, tough. AMARE
heads to the back room.
HOWARD
You remember my boy Nadav right?
Hello.
Hey.

AMARE
NADAV

HOWARD starts to close the door. NICO gets up.
NICO
Keep the door open please.
HOWARD keeps the door open.
AMARE extends a leather weekend bag to HOWARD. He unzips the bag
and sees neatly stacked bundles of cash.
AMARE
Look, I know what you did at the
auction house. I have the upper
hand here, but that’s not the way I
am. I’m a man of my word.
HOWARD
(laughing)
I’ve learned that.
HOWARD turns to his safe, opens the heavy door and grabs the
purple wooden box from Christies, extends it to AMARE, who opens
it and pulls the gem out.
AMARE caresses the gem, feels its weight.

104.
AMARE
You have no idea what this will do
for me. I’ll be a different person
on the court tonight.
HOWARD
I genuinely believe that.
AMARE
I think I’ve even figured it out.
It’s like I was saying on the phoneAMARE begins theorizing about the power of the gem. HOWARD seems
to be listening until...
A jolt of energy courses through HOWARD’S body. He jerks up,
turns to his computer and brings up a betting site.
HOWARD
Nadav, quick-quick.
AMARE falls silent.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Transfer all the money into your
gym bag.
NADAV dumps his boxing gear onto the floor. HOWARD pulls money
out from AMARE’S leather bag and shoves it into NADAV’S gym bag.
BUZZ! JIM and ROBERT appear on the security cam. They are buzzed
into the showroom.
NADAV
What’re we doing?
Shhhhh.

HOWARD

NADAV now helps HOWARD transfer the money.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Nadav, listen carefully. Go
downstairs, get in the first town
car you see and tell him to take
you straight to Foxwoods. Okay?
Uh, okay.

NADAV

HOWARD
Once you get there, you’re gonna go
straight to the sportsbook, when
you get there, you’re gonna do a 2
way parlay...
HOWARD writes this down on a piece of paper.

105.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
I’m gonna write it for you: A two
way parlay. Amare’s points/rebounds
with the spread of the game. You’re
gonna put all of the money in this
bag onto that bet.
HOWARD hands NADAV the paper.
NADAV
I don’t know how to... IHOWARD
Don’t worry. Just take that and
this and go downstairs and take a
car to Foxwoods. Call me when you
get there. You can hand that note
to the teller at the sports book
and she’ll know what to do.
AMARE is genuinely amused.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to NADAV)
Don’t say anything to anyone out
there when you leave. You’re ‘goin
to the gym.’ Understand?
NADAV nods, gets up, opens the BACKROOM door, JIM, ROBERT, NICO
and BODY GUARD 1 look at NADAV, who averts his eyes.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
NADAV moves slowly behind the showcases, passing SADIE.

Oh, have fun.
NADAV moves through the space past everyone and is buzzed out.

AMARE
Okay, I gotta run to medical.
AMARE stands, gives a very earnest hug and pound to HOWARD.
HOWARD
Knock ‘em dead tonight.

You know I will.
AMARE exits the backroom.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
AMARE gives a kiss goodbye to SADIE.
AMARE
Where’s the other girl?
SADIE
Joani? She doesn’t come in on

Well, there he is!
AMARE smiles, and moves out onto the floor. He shakes hands .
AMARE

The driver’s window falls down. NADAV climbs towards the it.
NADAV
I need to go to Foxwoods in
Connecticut.
DRIVER
I can’t now. Sorry.
NADAV
I’ll give you a huge tip, 400$.
DRIVER
Which way you wanna go?
NADAV
The fastest way.

107.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - BACKROOM - AFTER
JIM and ROBERT, with NICO still in the showroom, enter the
backroom.
JIM
You didn’t want to come out with
your boy? Introduce us?
HOWARD
You’re not gonna believe it!
What?

JIM

HOWARD
We’re gonna hit it! He’s got the
gem, he’s gonna destroy the money
line.
JIM
What are you talking about?
ROBERT picks up the leather bag AMARE brought in. It’s empty.
ROBERT
What’s going on?
HOWARD
I sent my boy Nadav to Foxwoods,
paying cash, clean. Parlaying the
money-line with the over on his
points plus rebounds. Odds are 4 to
1!! 4 to 1! I’ll cut you 400 of it.
JIM
You’re out of your fuckin’ mind,
you gotta be out of your mind.
HOWARD
What’s wrong with you, we’re gonna
be rich-I can get us courtside
seats for tonight, it’ll be great!
JIM
Where’s the money right now?
HOWARD
I told you, it’s on it’s way to
Connecticut!
ROBERT pulls out a gun. HOWARD all of a sudden grows scared.
NICO runs into the doorway, closes the door to the showroom.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Guys, look, I’m here, with you
right now, telling you about a
winning ticket! C’mon I’m not
fucking you here. Why would I try
to screw you guys?

108.
JIM
(slowly, forcefully)
Call him and tell him to come back
with the cash right now.
HOWARD
(possessed, head down)
I can’t do that. I just can’t do
that. I’m sorry. I can’t. We’re
shoe-ins. Trust me.
ROBERT throws HOWARD against the safe behind him and presses the
gun up into HOWARD’s face.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(insisting)
I can’t...
JIM
I’m not fucking around! Call him
right now!
HOWARD
Why!?! It doesn’t make any sense.
ROBERT and NICO rush HOWARD over to the window. JIM opens it.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
ROBERT and NICO pick HOWARD up and thrust his body out the
window. HOWARD braces his arms against the window frame trying
to stop them.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(screaming)
STOP!
JIM pins HOWARD’S arms to his body. ROBERT and NICO slide him
out the window, hanging him upside down 12 stories above 47th
street. HOWARD flails and thrashes. SADIE hears his screams and
begins banging on the back room door.
SADIE (O.S.)
HEY! WHAT’S GOING ON BACK THERE!?!
EXT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - BACKROOM - OUT OF WINDOW
HOWARD
PLEASE, STOP, PULL ME UP! PLEASE!!!
JIM
You gonna call your boy?
HOWARD
I’LL CALL HIM! I’LL CALL HIM!
ROBERT and NICO dip his body further down.

109.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!!
JIM
You gonna listen to me?
YEEESSSS!

HOWARD

JIM backs away from the window. ROBERT and NICO pull HOWARD back
into the room.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM
HOWARD’s face is beat red. He looks like he’s going to throw up.
SADIE (O.S.)
Howie, you ok?!
HOWARD
(tremulous voice)
I’m ok baby. It’s all good, don’t
worry about it.
JIM stands over the desk, he engages HOWARD’s speakerphone.
Dial it.

JIM

HOWARD sits down. Pause.
Let’s go!

JIM (CONT’D)

HOWARD
Will you give me a second to
collect myself. My heart.
JIM
What’s the number? I’ll dial it.
HOWARD leans in over the phone, another long pause. He hits a
few numbers and stops.
HOWARD
I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I just
can’t.
JIM is dumbstruck. A guilty smile unfurls on HOWARD’s sweaty
face.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(with total sincerity)
I’m really sorry about this, Jim.
Another pause. JIM nods to ROBERT.

110.
JIM
(with menacing resolve)
Goodbye Howard.
JIM, ROBERT and NICO turn to exit the backroom.
HOWARD
(hopping out of his chair)
Jim? Jim! C’mon, we can talk about
this. This is more than an
opportunity here.
HOWARD follows them into the showroom.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE - SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD
What are you doing? Where are you
going?
JIM, ROBERT and NICO snake around the showcase and out onto he
floor. They approach the front door. SADIE buzzes open the first
door. AS soon as all three are in the vestibule and the door
closes behind them, HOWARD rushes over to SADIE and grabs her
wrist.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
STOP! STOP! STOP!
JIM pulls on the second door. It doesn’t open. He turns around
and yells through the thick glass:
JIM
(severely muffled)
BUZZ US OUT!
HOWARD walks towards the glass door, riddled with guilt and
excitement. He yells:
HOWARD
JIM, I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY!
JIM
LET ME THE FUCK OUT HOWARD!
HOWARD
YOU GOTTA TAKE A HOME DOG, THEY’RE
PLUS 275 AT HOME IT MAKES NO SENSE!
THEY’RE PLAYING THE FUCKING
HORNETS, THE HORNETS ARE 5 AND 10
ON THE ROAD! THE LINE DOESN’T MAKE
SENSE! DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
GAME AMARE HAD WITH THE GEM? A
40/20 GAME! HE’S UNDERVALUED
BECAUSE OF SHITTY PLAY WITHOUT THE
GEM. YOU JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND!

111.
JIM
(infuriated)
NO, YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND! YOU ARE
GOING TO OPEN THIS DOOR NOW OR
YOU’RE DEAD!
NICO and ROBERT start pounding on the glass.
HOWARD
JIM, I’M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THIS
TO YOURSELF!
JIM
OPEN THE DOOR!!!
HOWARD
NOT TILL THIS IS ALL OKAY.
JIM
THE SECOND YOU OPEN THAT DOOR
YOU’RE A DEAD MAN!!!!
JIM spews out profanity. HOWARD yells over him:
HOWARD
I UNDERSTAND YOU’RE UPSET, I’M
SORRY, I REALLY AM. AFTER THE GAME
IS OVER WE’LL BE IN A BETTER PLACE
AND I’LL OPEN THE DOORS, BUT TILL
THEN- I REALLY KNOW WHAT I’M
TALKING ABOUT, IT’S NOT BULLSHIT,
IT’S REAL, THIS IS HUGE. I LET YOU
GO NOW AND IT’S ALL OVER.
ROBERT pulls out his gun points it at HOWARD through the glass.
OPEN IT!

ROBERT

SADIE screams and she and ELAN hide behind the showcase.
HOWARD
WHAT’S THAT GONNA DO? THAT’S NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING?
(to SADIE and ELAN)
Sadie, baby everything is fine.
It’s bulletproof- Why don’t you
guys go wait in the back room?
SADIE and ELAN run into the back room.
Silence. Inside the vestibule JIM tells ROBERT to put the gun
away, though none of their dialogue is audible. From inside the
showroom it looks like pantomime.
HOWARD watches JIM make a phone call.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
WHO YOU CALLING? WHAT’RE YOU DOING?

112.
Instinctively, HOWARD runs to a phone behind the showcase.
HOWARD dials, awaits rings. Talks into phone:
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Dina, baby, I just got a very scary
call from ConEd, they reported a
bad gas leak all down 108th.
They’re evacuating our block, go to
Shiela’s now... No, I don’t know
why they called the office...
Howard Listens... BUZZ! MICHAEL and ANOTHER MAN (JIM’S MEN)
appear on the monitor. HOWARD listens to DINA, watches JIM.
JIM
(to other door)
WE CAN’T OPEN THE DOOR, PSYCHO’S
GOT US LOCKED IN HERE!
HOWARD
(into phone)
I don’t want to argue! Don’t ask
questions, just grab the kids and
do it. I’m very serious, I’m very
frightened.
(pause)
Yes, I’ll see you there.
HOWARD slams the phone down.
INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - SAME TIME
NADAV sits with the gym bag on his lap. He looks out the window
at bumper to bumper traffic. He checks his phone, it’s 5:45.
NADAV
(to driver)
What’s going on with this?
DRIVER
It’s rush hour traffic.
Go faster.

NADAV

DRIVER
I can’t do anything about this.
NADAV
I’ll give you an extra $200 if you
can get me there before 7pm.
The DRIVER looks at the estimated arrival time on his GPS: 735PM

113.
EXT. FOXWOODS CASINO, LEDYARD, CT. - 6:55PM.
The Lincoln town car pulls up to the entrance. NADAV pops out of
the back, runs, slips and falls, gets up immediately and runs
into the casino.
INT. FOXWOODS CASINO, LEDYARD, CT. - CONTINUOUS
NADAV looks around, immediately lost.
NADAV
(to a STRANGER)
Sports?
STRANGER is confused.
NADAV (CONT’D)
Where’s the sports betting?
That way.

STRANGER

INT. FOXWOODS CASINO, LEDYARD, CT. - SPORTS BOOK
NADAV runs past a TV broadcasting the pregame show. Shots of
Amare in a lay up line.
NADAV approaches a FEMALE TELLER at the sports book and takes
the paper HOWARD gave him out of his pocket.
NADAV
(out of breath)
I need to do a parlay. Uh. Two way.
FEMALE TELLER
Why don’t you just hand me that
piece of paper.
She reads the bet aloud. NADAV confirms it as she types into a
computer.
FEMALE TELLER (CONT’D)
What amount?
$175,000.

NADAV

FEMALE TELLER looks up at NADAV, that’s a big bet. Calls over a
SUPERVISOR. NADAV unloads cash from the bag onto the counter.
INT. KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- SHOWROOM - SAME TIME
JIM, ROBERT and NICO sit indolently on the floor of the
vestibule. They all have their jackets off and there is little
talk between them. JIM’s face is beat red and slick with sweat.

114.
HOWARD pulls a flat screen TV from the back room and positions
it in front of the glass door so JIM can see it. Using a long
extension cord, he plugs it in and turns it on.
On screen, AMARE greets an opponent center court. HOWARD looks
manic, jittery, eager. He looks to the BACKROOM, where we can
see SADIE and ELAN idly playing with their phones.
HOWARD’s cell phone rings. It’s NADAV.

So?

HOWARD
(into phone)

(listens, grows happy)
YESSSS! Listen, I’m gonna put you
on speakerphone and I want you to
repeat it loudly for some people to
hear, ok?
HOWARD places it on speakerphone.
NADAV’S VOICE
I PUT THE 175,000 ONTO THE TWO WAY
BET. AMARE’S POINTS PLUS HIS
REBOUNDS WITH THE MONEYLINE.
JIM doesn’t even make eye contact with HOWARD.
HOWARD
THE BET! THE BET IS IN!
An announcer catches HOWARD’s attention. The game has begun! On
screen, AMARE tips the ball back to a guard and immediately
sprint towards the hoop, rising for an immediate alley-oop.
HOWARD howls.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
AHAHA! That’s 2 right off the bat.
ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
Amare with the stuff and the steal!
AMARE pulls up for a jump shot.
ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
And Amare with a 20 footer! Knicks
4, Hornets 0.
ANNOUNCER 2
That’s a good sign for the Knicks
when Amare’s hitting those elbow
jumpers.
HOWARD
Nice... his shot’s falling.
(yells to backroom)
Sadie! Elan! Come!
JIM, ROBERT and NICO look at the screen. SADIE and ELAN join
HOWARD in the showroom.

115.
The Hornets are forced into a bad shot. AMARE rebounds.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to Jim)
ALRIGHT, THAT’S ONE REBOUND AND
FOUR POINTS. THAT’S 5. WE’RE AT 5
AND IT’S NOT EVEN 2 MINUTES!
ANNOUNCER
This is the AMARE the Knicks need
on a nightly basis. Focused and
Possessed.
HOWARD
Exactly, focused.
AMARE sprints up-court, engages in a pick and roll and rises for
an explosive dunk. Upon take off the image falls into slow
motion. The sound maintains. HOWARD watches.
In a series of cuts we see AMARE in highlight: each in slow
motion. Intercut, we see the Knicks lead build and build.
Another series of slow-motion AMARE highlights. HOWARD grows
more and more enthusiastic like a man possessed. JIM and Co show
no emotion. AMARE swishes through one last turn around jumper,
the ball gracefully flows through the net.
BOOM, we’re back in real time. 30 seconds left. The score
Knicks: 94, Hornets: 83. A shot of AMARE shows him smiling ear
to ear joking with another player. A graphic shows his stat
line: 34 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists. HOWARD points to the
screen.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Look at that stat line!!!! He blew
the over out of the fucking moon!
The Hornets cross the half-court line and dribble out the
remainder of the clock. The end horn sounds. HOWARD jumps:
HOWARD (CONT’D)
(to JIM)
SEE! SEE! WHAT DID I TELL YOU?! HUH
JIM? WHAT DID I FUCKIN TELL YOU?!
JIM, ROBERT and NICO stand up. HOWARD dances over to the
showcase and hits the buzzer with his fist.
BUZZZZ!
ROBERT opens the door into the space and IMMEDIATELY SHOOTS
HOWARD IN THE FACE. HOWARD drops to the floor.
SADIE
(screaming)
HOWARD!!!
We see HOWARD in a shot from above. The bullet has created a
gruesome hole under his right eye.

116.
The camera starts to slowly zoom into HOWARD’s face, keeping the
hole center frame.
SADIE runs up to HOWARD and picks up his head.
SADIE (CONT’D)
OH GOD! OH GOD!
The zoom continues into HOWARD while we hear the following...
JIM barks orders with steely composure:
JIM (O.S.)
SHUT UP...
(to ELAN)
YOU, TAKE HIM TO WHERE THE SECURITY
CAMERAS RECORD TO.
ELAN is dragged to the back room. SADIE sobs uncontrollably.
Zoom creeps tighter into HOWARD.
ELAN (O.S.)
There. It records onto that drive.
We hear machinery ripped out from a wall.
ELAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
PLEASE DON’T HURT ME.
NICO (o.S.)
OPEN THE SAFE!
ElAN (o.S.)
I DON’T KNOW THE CODE. PLEASE DON’T
SHOOT-LOOK, LOOK IT’S OPEN!
NICO (o.S.)
FILL THAT BAG WITH EVERY THING.
The zoom has reached a close up on HOWARD, keeps moving in.
JIM (O.S.)
(to SADIE)
GET UP!
SADIE hysterically falls all over HOWARD.
JIM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
GET UP AND PACK THE SHOWCASE!
SADIE (O.S.)
(crying, screaming)
FUCK YOU, YOU FAT PIG!
We hear a gun shot. SADIE’s no longer heard. ELAN yells from the
other room.

117.
ELAN (O.S.)
Sadie?! SADIE!!
The shot has now zoomed into a very tight close up on HOWARD.
NICO (O.S.)
KEEP PACKING!
ELAN (O.S.)
SADIE?! WHAT HAPPENED!?!
Commotion from the back room. Another gun shot is heard.
The zoom closes in on the bullet-hole in HOWARD’s face and
continues onward into the wound.
Swirls of red, pink and white engulf the frame as we travel
through blood, bone and tissue.
The zoom pushes through this material plane into a landscape of
kaleidoscopic abstract shapes and flickering iridescent light.
The diegetic audio in the KMA GEMS showroom decays in a wash of
reverb, overtaken by a vast sound-scape of crystal tinkles and
warm electronic tones.
END CREDITS appear and continue over this visual and aural
cosmic journey inside the consummate UNCUT GEM.
