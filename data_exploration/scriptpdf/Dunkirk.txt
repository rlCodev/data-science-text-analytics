Super title:
DUNKIRK
FADE IN:
Paper. Falling like snow. Six young, filthy Tommy's raise
their heads along a deserted street, checking rubbish bins,
windows... One crouches to check a coiled garden hose. He
tries the tap - nothing...
Title 1:
THE ENEMY HAVE DRIVEN
THE BRITISH AND FRENCH ARMIES TO THE SEA
One Tommy plucks paper from the air... Propaganda leaflets
showing their position... “YOU ARE SURROUNDED”....
Title 2:
TRAPPED AT DUNKIRK,
THEY AWAIT THEIR FATE
He wads the leaflets up, crouches, drops his trousers... The
Tommy with the hose carefully lifts each side...
Title 3:
HOPING FOR DELIVERANCE
He gets a tiny dribble of water which he licks from the
nozzle Title 4:
FOR A MIRACLE
BLAM BLAM BLAM! Tommy jolts, grabs his trousers. All six race
away from us, towards a fence twenty yards away. One by one,
five are shot down. The survivor climbs the fence. Gunfire
bursts through the fence, ten feet away Tommy tries to reload his rifle - fingers struggling with the
magazine, training forgotten. Gunfire splinters the fence,
five feet away Tommy thrusts his index finger into the breech of his rifle
again and again, scraping skin. A round jumps into the
chamber -

2.
Gunfire three feet away Tommy tries once, twice - slides the bolt forward Gunfire right next to him Tommy spins around, fires blind until empty, scrambles out
the back. He races down narrow Dunkirk streets. Breathing.
Kit jangling... Building after building... He rounds a corner
BLAM! Bullets hit dirt and bricks near him. The street ahead
is barricaded, manned by French troops.
TOMMY
ANGLAIS! AINGLAIS!
The French stop firing and wave him through.
He scrambles over their sandbag barricade, taking in their
dirty frightened faces as he passes...
A French Soldier grabs him...
FRENCH SOLDIER
Allez, Anglais.
Tommy’s mouth opens at the man’s bitterness.
FRENCH SOLDIER (CONT’D)
(contempt)
Bon voyage.
He shoves Tommy down the street behind their protection.
Gunfire behind. Tommy takes off again, hurtling down the dark
street, heading towards the blazing light of EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS
The longest, widest beach he’s ever seen, sunlight dazzling
off the water, endless dark fences snaking across the sand
and out into the water. Tommy squints - not fences, lines of
men, hundreds of thousands of men...
Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach. He clambers over a
dune, feverishly undoing his belt, dropping trousers and
squatting before he realizes He’s not alone Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with the
labour of burying a body. This is Gibson.

3.
The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses. Tommy
finishes, pulls ups his trousers and moves towards him. Tommy
helps stoop to tie over the body.
Tommy notices the corpe’s stockinged feet, then watches
Gibson stoop to tie his boots...
Gibson looks up at him. Tommy shrugs, gestures for Gibson’s
water can. Gibson hands it over and Tommy takes a swig,
carefully catching drops in his hand, then licking them off
his palm.
Tommy leaves Gibson buttoning his shirt and heads back onto
the beach.
There are destroyers out on the water, too far to reach.
Tommy wanders down to join one of the long, snaking lines
which extends into the sea, soldiers up to their chests in
water, waiting patiently for ships which do not move.
The man at the back turns to Tommy, unwelcoming. Points at
his own insignia.
MAN
Grenadiers, mate.
Tommy moves off. Looks around at other impossibly long lines,
at the unattainable ships. Futile.
A line of stretcher-bearers comes past, carrying wounded men
along the beach towards the harbour...
Looking where they’re headed, Tommy sees a long, narrow
breakwater extending out into the sea, packed with soldiers.
A hospital ship at the end of it.
This breakwater extends a kilometer into the sea. It is
called the Mole.
Super title:
1. THE MOLE
one week
Tommy becomes aware of the sound of distant aircraft.
Soldiers peer up into the sky...
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
DIVE BOMBERS!

4.
Tommy spots the distinctive kinked wings of the notorious
Stuka dive bomber, its nightmarish howl rising as it picks up
speed, diving at the beach...
The lines of men instantly vanish - soldiers scattering back
to the dunes, burrowing into the sand... The first bombs lift
sand into the air.
The stretcher-bearers put down their loads, lying across
them, protecting them as the area is hammered...
The first Stuka pulls out of its dive, revealing two more
Stukas diving. There are nine more about to follow...
Tommy sees a soldier lying on his back, rifle aimed at the
sky, firing defiantly, desperately at the attacking plane...
The ground around him lifts into the air with the second wave
of bombs.
Tommy buries his face in the sand as the bombs blast and
blast and blast The explosions stop. Tommy lifts his head. BOOM! Another wave
of bombs explodes in series up the beach. Then, finally,
quiet. Tommy rises...
The stretcher-bearers, back on their feet, lift their burdens
(four bearers per stretcher, one at each corner).
Several stretchers are left behind on the sand.
Soldiers on the beach watch in despair as one of the
destroyers is slipping below the water, smoke billowing.
MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
WHERE’S THE BLOODY AIR FORCE?!
CUT TO:
EXT. ENGLISH COAST, WEYMOUTH HARBOUR - MORNING
A lanky youth runs down to the masts of the crowded harbour.
He races along the wooden dock, jumping over the ropes as he
rushes to a large yacht, the Moonstone.
Super title:
2. THE SEA

5.
The youth, George (seventeen), leaps from the dock into the
well. Two naval officers emerge from the cabin, pushing past.
George watches them go, confused...
Mr. Dawson (fifties, civilian dress) hands George a stack of
china plates and ducks back inside.
A second young man, Peter (nineteen), emerges, carrying
boxes.
PETER
Navy’s requisitioned her - there’s
some men across the Channel, at
Dunkirk, need taking off.
(points at dock)
They told us to strip her and load
those life jackets.
George looks along at the dock. At a pile of hundreds of life
jackets. George looks at Peter. Surprised.
Some men?

GEORGE

PETER
Navy’ll be back in an hour. My dad
wants to be ready before then...
CUT TO:
EXT. SKY - DAY
Moving through billowy peaks, three sleek, beautiful
Spitfires streak into frame. Elegant. In confident formation.

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
The pilot, Farrier, has a light touch on the controls. He
checks his left and right, scanning the skies.

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier checks his chart.
FORTIS LEADER
Keep an eye on that gauge, even
when it gets lively - save enough
to get back.
With a glance at his fuel gauge, Farrier pulls on the stick.
EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
The three planes bank left in perfect harmony as we CUT TO:
EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - LATE AFTERNOON
Tommy looks down at several patients on stretchers left
behind bearers dead or disappeared...
One of them groans. Still alive.
Tommy looks around. Gibson is there.
They grab the stretcher and hustle down the beach towards the
mole...

7.
EXT. BASE OF THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
A Warrant Officer tries to keep order as men line up to start
the shuffle out along the eight-foot wide concrete mole.
The line of stretcher-bearers approaches...
From the base all you can see is the backs of helmeted heads
queuing out onto the narrow breakwater.
The Warrant Officer sees the stretchers, waves them past WARRANT OFFICER
Along the mole. All the way, she’s
leaving A ship’s whistle WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D)
That’s it.
(he turns)
MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY!
The stretcher-bearers squeeze past...
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS
Tommy and Gibson hear the ship’s whistle. They start running
with the stretcher, heading for the base of the mole...
EXT. BASE OF THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Warrant Officer addresses a group of French soldiers.
WARRANT OFFICER
NO FRENCH! NON FRANÇAISES SEULEMENT ANGLAISES! ENGLISH ONLY,
YOU’LL HAVE YOUR OWN SHIPS!
Tommy and Gibson arrive, panting. The Warrant Officer looks
up at them. The ship’s whistle - the Warrant Officer points
up WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D)
That’s two minutes - you’ve missed
it.
He turns back to arguing with the French...
Tommy pushes forward with the stretcher. Soldiers try to let
him through on the narrow mole -

8.
The Warrant Officer, seeing Tommy, just shakes his head.
EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Stretchers are loaded up the gangplank onto the deck of the
ship, supervised by a Petty Officer.
He checks his watch, then looks along the mole at the
remaining stretchers...
EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
Tommy weaves along the mole, squeezing past the mass of
troops jamming the breakwater...
Tommy leans out over the edge where the rail is missing, a
twenty-foot drop to the churning water...
Gibson follows, echoing Tommy’s route and footing.
EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS
The last of the line of stretchers is carefully, awkwardly
raised up from the mole onto the deck of the ship. The Petty
Officer speaks urgently to the last stretcher-bearer.
Last?

PETTY OFFICER

The Stretcher-Bearer nods, too breathless to speak, then
follows his colleagues back down off the ship.
An explosion hits the water nearby Everyone hits the deck as shells impacts the water.
EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
Tommy is pulled up short as Gibson stumbles An ME 109 strafes the length of the mole with gunfire soldiers hit the deck, several are hit...
Gibson struggles up.
CUT TO:

9.
EXT. WEYMOUTH HARBOUR - DAY
Peter and George rush things off the boat, then start loading
the orange life-preservers. Mr. Dawson looks up from his
charts to see naval officers and crew coming along the
harbour, assigning crew members to boats...
Peter follows his gaze INT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS
Peter bursts into the cabin, stacking life vests.
EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS
The pile of life vests on the dock shrinks... Mr. Dawson
watches the naval men coming closer CUT TO:
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier lightly brushes his fingers over the dashboard.
COLLINS
(over radio)
Dunkirk’s so far, why can’t they
load at Calais?
Farrier looks over at his wing mate, Collins (Fortis 2).
FORTIS LEADER
(over radio)
The enemy had something to say
about it.
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS
Collins scans the skies above...
COLLINS
Down here we’re sitting ducks.
FORTIS LEADER
(over radio)
Keep ‘em peeled. They’ll come out
of the sun.

10.
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier looks around into the blinding sun...
CUT TO:
EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS
The Petty Officer barks orders at the crew PETTY OFFICER
Man the bow line! Ready on the
stern!
Troops stuck down on the mole below look resentfully at the
ship preparing to depart. One Soldier calls up SOLDIER
Any more room?
The Petty Officer glares down at him.
EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
Tommy breaks through a tight crowd of soldiers and stops.
In front of him is a jagged chasm. One narrow plank laid
across it. The drop is fifteen feet to rocks and concrete
below.
The ship’s whistle sounds. Tommy stares SOLDIER
Take a run at it!
Tommy glances at the Soldier who spoke. Looks back at Gibson.
TOMMY
One, two, three!
Tommy bolts across, pure concentration, the plank bowing and
bouncing as he crosses the middle, Gibson following. Tommy’s
foot slips, he almost goes over, rights himself Helpful arms grab them as they hit the other side, a couple
of cheers from the crowd. Tommy ploughs on -

11.
EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Tommy passes the stretcher-bearers coming back down the mole.
One of them moves to help but Tommy shakes his head, pushing
past.
The Petty Officer gestures at his men to pull the gangplanks PETTY OFFICER
PULL THE GANGPLANKS!
Tommy and Gibson arrive at the end of the mole.
Oi!

TOMMY

A gangplank is shoved back down.
They struggle up it with the stretcher.
When they make it to the deck they practically drop their
burden, gasping for breath. Orderlies takes the stretcher
below.
Tommy and Gibson look around for a place to perch, catching
their breaths...
CUT TO:
EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS
Mr. Dawson sees the Naval Officers stepping onto their dock MR. DAWSON
Ready on the stern line.
George hops onto the dock, unties the stern line. Stops.
Looks at the approaching Officers. Then back to Mr. Dawson GEORGE
Aren’t you waiting for the navy?
Mr. Dawson starts the engine. Peter jumps down onto the boat
with the bow rope...
MR. DAWSON
They’ve asked for the Moonstone,
they’ll have her. With her captain.
PETER
And his son.

12.
The boat moves off. Peter looks to catch the line from
George.
PETER (CONT’D)
Thanks for the help, George.
Who, instead, jumps onto the stern, to Peter’s surprise.
PETER (CONT’D)
You know where we’re going?
France.

GEORGE

MR. DAWSON
Into war, George.
GEORGE
I’ll be useful, sir.
Mr. Dawson looks at George. Pushes the throttle forward and
they motor out of the harbour into the English Channel...

plane takes the left one (Collins), hurtling down INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS
Collins dives, rolling, glancing back -

13.
COLLINS
He’s on me!
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier banks around, lining up on Collins’ pursuer.
FARRIER
And I’m on him CUT TO:
EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - EVENING
Tommy and Gibson shuffle around the deck, looking for a spot
to settle...
The Able Seaman manning the gangplank calls over ABLE SEAMAN
You two, get a shift on!
Tommy reluctantly follows Gibson onto the plank.
EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS
As he shuffles down the gangplank he looks over at the
thousands queuing on the mole...
A Second Lieutenant on the mole waves Tommy along SECOND LIEUTENANT
Off you two! Back up the line!
As Tommy steps off the plank he hears a noise: Gibson, finger
to his lips, ‘shush’, is crouched in the crisscross structure
below the mole where he can’t be seen by the officers on top.
He beckons Tommy to join him...
PETTY OFFICER
That last barrage damaged the
rudder!
The Second Lieutenant turns to the Petty Officer. Tommy slips
down beside Gibson SECOND LIEUTENANT
Tie up again while we try to fix
it.

14.
They settle in on the beams just above the water line...
CUT TO:
EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - MORNING
Mr. Dawson comes to the back of the well, fits the tiller, to
steer from outside, Peter at his side. George, on the bow,
looks across at several naval vessels on the same course.
Suddenly he spots a bomber overhead GEORGE
Mr. Dawson!
Mr. Dawson’s eyes don’t leave his course MR. DAWSON
One of ours, George.
George looks up at the plane. A Blenheim passes over.
Looking down to his left - a fishing trawler bobbing along.
Further back down the convoy he sees a Thames paddle steamer.
A destroyer approaches from the opposite direction. As George
peers, he starts to make out shapes of men on the decks.
The destroyer passes close enough that George can see the
boat is packed with soldiers. Weary, bedraggled, dispirited
soldiers. George stares at the haunted faces.
As the Moonstone rides over the wake of the destroyer, an
ominous boom reverberates in the distance. Too sudden for
thunder, the boom multiplies into a distant barrage...
Mr. Dawson comes forward, drawn by the sound. He stares at
the horizon - distant black smoke precisely where they’re
headed. More booms. Mr. Dawson looks at George. Who is
scared. He puts his hand on his shoulder. Nods reassuringly.
CUT TO:
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier concentrates, trying to angle his plane at the tail
of the ME 109 ahead... but the German plane keeps pulling out
of his sights, turning right, pulling g’s, rolling...
FARRIER
On my mark - draw him left, Fortis
2... Three, two, one, mark -

15.
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS
Collins pulls hard left, rolling up and left as tracer fire
streaks past.
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier watches the ME 109 cut left to follow Collins. He
pushes the button on his stick to strafe the plane with his
cannons... Smoke starts trailing from the German plane.
Clear.

FARRIER

EXT. SKY OVER ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS
The ME 109 trails heavy smoke as it tips towards the water INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS
Collins straightens out, tries to look back COLLINS
Is he down?
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier watches the ME 109 smash into the water, breaking up
in a fiery mess FARRIER
Down for the count Tracer fire smashes into Farrier’s plane, sparking inside and
out. Farrier banks hard right as a second 109 streaks away.
He straightens up.
FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis leader, one bandit down...
Nothing.
FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis leader, do you read?
Nothing.
Farrier looks around, spots a Spitfire -

16.
FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis 2, I have you to port - no
eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.
COLLINS
(over radio)
Understood, Fortis 1. Orbit for a
look...
Farrier looks all around as he pulls right on the stick...
CUT TO:
EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING
Eerie quiet.
Tommy and Gibson sit in the structure, unseen, listening...
Commander Bolton checks his progress on board the hospital
ship.
COMMANDER BOLTON
How long, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They’re scrambling.
Commander Bolton turns to Colonel Winnant, the army
representative.
COMMANDER BOLTON
Colonel, you’re going to have to
decide how many more wounded to
evacuate... one stretcher takes the
space of seven standing men.
Colonel Winnant takes this in.
Tommy crouches lower as he sees a launch approach...
A high-ranking officer is helped up the ladder onto the mole.
COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
(salutes)
Rear Admiral.
REAR ADMIRAL
Commander.
(to Colonel Winnant)
At ease, Colonel. How’s the
perimeter?

17.
Colonel Winnant gestures towards the smoke-shrouded town COLONEL WINNANT
Shrinking ever day. But between our
rearguard and the French... we’re
holding the line. And the enemy
tanks I’ve stopped.
Why?

COMMANDER BOLTON

COLONEL WINNANT
Waste precious tanks, when you can
pick us off from the air, like fish
in a barrel?
COMMANDER BOLTON
How long does London expect the
army to hold out before we make
terms?
The Rear Admiral looks sharply at the idea.
REAR ADMIRAL
Make terms? They’re not stopping
here. We need to get our army back.
The Rear Admiral points across the dark water...
REAR ADMIRAL (CONT’D)
Britain’s next. Then the world.
Commander Bolton puts his field glasses to his face.
COMMANDER BOLTON
Christ, you can almost see it from
here...
What?

COLONEL WINNANT

COMMANDER BOLTON
Home.
(turns to town)
What about the French?
REAR ADMIRAL
Publicly, Churchill’s told them
bras dessous.
(off look)
Arm in arm. Leaving together.
COLONEL WINNANT
And privately?

18.
REAR ADMIRAL
We need our army back.
COLONEL WINNANT
How many men are they talking
about?
REAR ADMIRAL
Churchill wants thirty thousand.
Ramsay’s hoping we can give him
forty-five.
Commander Bolton looks out at the mass of humanity.
COMMANDER BOLTON
There are four hundred thousand men
on this beach, sir.
Down below, Tommy takes this in. Every man for himself.
REAR ADMIRAL
We’ll just have to do our best.
Bolton straightens up.
COMMANDER BOLTON
Right, this mole stays open at all
costs.
Bolton points at the funnel and masts of sunken ships.
COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
We’re in range of artillery from
the west - anything else sinks out
here, the mole’s blocked and we’re
stuffed.
REAR ADMIRAL
Can’t we load from the beaches?
COLONEL WINNANT
Better than standing out here when
the dive bombers come.
COMMANDER BOLTON
Impossible.
The Rear Admiral looks at the lines of men on the beaches.
REAR ADMIRAL
Too shallow.

19.
COMMANDER BOLTON
Anything drafting more than three
feet can’t get near. We don’t have
enough small boats to ferry men out
to the destroyers.
The Rear Admiral nods.
REAR ADMIRAL
The mole it is, gentlemen.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY
Mr. Dawson is on the bow, peering ahead. The distant smoke is
closer, small shapes in the sky move above distant ships,
accompanied by thunderous booms...
Much nearer: a shape. A wreck. Upside down.
Mr. Dawson moves quickly down the yacht to the well and takes
the helm, throttling back. He gestures for Peter to head to
the bow.
The Moonstone approaches the wreck. Bodies surround the
overturned hull.
Crouched on the hull - a soldier.
Mr. Dawson reverses the screw, slowing to a crawl. Peter
stares out at the Shivering Soldier.
PETER
Can you swim?
The Shivering Soldier stares back at Peter. Peter looks back
at Mr. Dawson.
PETER (CONT’D)
Can you get closer?
Mr. Dawson looks down the side of the boat, considers.
MR. DAWSON
Can’t risk it!
Mr. Dawson turns to George.
MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Take Peter a line.

20.
George grabs a coiled rope and heads up to the bow. Peter
takes the rope from George PETER
I’ll throw you a line!
The Shivering Soldier looks up at him, blank. Peter tosses
the line. It hits the water several feet in front of the
soldier who stares at it.
Peter gathers the line, then tosses it again.
The Shivering Soldier springs for it, grabbing it and hanging
on as Peter and George reel him in, pulling him around to the
stern ladder.
He is too exhausted to make it up the ladder, so they grab
his shirt, pulling him into the well.
George grabs a blanket and puts it around the Soldier’s
shoulders.
Mr. Dawson glances at the Soldier, then reverses from the
wreck the way they came in, and steers wide around the
visible portion of the wreck.
Once the water ahead is open, Mr. Dawson speeds up, heading
again for the dark smoke of Dunkirk.
CUT TO:
EXT. SKY ABOVE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

No, it’s Fortis Leader, over.
COLLINS
Do you think he got out?
FARRIER

The glass is cracked. He taps it with his glove. Nothing.
FARRIER
Fortis 2, what’s your fuel?
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS
Collins checks his gauge.
COLLINS
Fifty gallons, over.
INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS
Farrier takes this down with a grease pencil...
FARRIER
Keep letting me know - my gauge
took a knock back there, over.
COLLINS
Should you turn back?
Farrier methodically checks his other gauge and switches...
checks the responsiveness of rudder, ailerons...
FARRIER
I’m confident it’s just the gauge.

22.
Farrier glances at his pencil mark, sets the bezel on his
watch.
He taps his gauge one more time. Nothing.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING
Bolton watches the Rear Admiral motor away in his launch, the
engine noise fading to be replaced by A familiar, dreaded sound, building. Stukas.
The men on the mole look up at the sky.
From high above we see how trapped and exposed this line of
men stretching a kilometer into the sea really is.
Restless, the soldiers look behind and in front. There’s
simply nowhere to go. The awful whine builds. Then changes
pitch as the bombers go into their dive.
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! The bombs impact the sea either
side of the mole. Soldiers crouch as low as they can The onslaught is endless, terrible and inescapable.
BOOM! A direct hit to the hospital ship The Stukas have gone.
Screams and shouts - people start jumping over the side of
the hospital ship onto the mole...
VOICES
She’s going down! SHE’S GOING
UNDER!
Commander Bolton shouts at the men manning the lines
COMMANDER BOLTON
CUT HER LOOSE!
The crew are jumping off the side, the burning ship is
sinking.
SUB-LIEUTENANT
What about the wounded?
COMMANDER BOLTON
Cut her loose, and push her off! We
can’t let her sink at the mole!

23.
The men cast her off and push her off. Crew members and
orderlies leap from the deck into the water The bow is blazing, sinking ship drifts away from the mole.
Tommy and Gibson pull soldiers up onto the beams of the mole.
As the bow comes around, the stern scrapes along the wooden
pilings, splintering them in its path A flailing soldier is in its path, trying to swim free The steel hull is about to crush him Tommy grabs him by the shoulders and yanks with all his
might, pulling him clear just as the hull grinds against the
wood. Tommy looks down on the breathless, wet soldier. The
wet soldier focuses on Tommy.
This is Alex. He nods thanks. Tommy nods back.
Commander Bolton watches the ship slip down into the waves.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY
Mr. Dawson is back at the helm. The Shivering Soldier sits in
the well, blanket over his shoulders. Staring at the deck.
George watches him, then leans forward.
GEORGE
Come below - it’s out of the wind.
The Shivering Soldier glances at the companionway. Shakes his
head.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Really - it’s warmer.
George reaches out for the Shivering Soldier’s arm - who
smacks it away MR. DAWSON
Leave him, George.
George looks up at the Commander.
MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
He feels safer on deck. You would
too if you’d been bombed -

Commander Bolton looks over at the wet soldiers clinging to
the understructure of the mole.
COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.)
Right, Highlanders. Let’s find you
another ship.
The wet soldiers pull themselves to their feet...
Tommy, watched by Alex, slips into the water, then pulls
himself out, dripping. Gibson follows suit. Alex laugh at
them... then helps them push into the group.
They follow the wet soldiers up onto the mole, where Bolton’s
men shepherd them onto a launch.
EXT. LAUNCH - CONTINUOUS
Tommy and Gibson make themselves inconspicuous among the
Highlanders, eyes down.
As the launch pulls away from the mole, Tommy glances back at
the men lining the breakwater.
The launch motors out of the harbour.
It approaches a destroyer, its sheer iron side towering above
the launch, as it bobs up and down alongside.
Cargo nets are dropped over the side, and the men start to
step up onto the rail of the bobbing ship, waiting for the
rhythmic movement towards the iron wall, grabbing at the rope
mesh, struggling to pull themselves up.
Tommy steps up to the railing, next to an exhausted soldier
who can barely lift himself up. Tommy grabs his shoulder to
steady on the rail as the launch bounces off the iron wall of
the destroyer.
They both grab at the net, Tommy climbing up -

Or did you at least have the
decency to bury him?
“Gibson” just stares.
TOMMY
He did. I helped him. I thought it

ALEX
Maybe he killed him TOMMY
He didn’t kill him ALEX

The mole is empty but for bodies.
A Private opens his eyes. He sits up, alone on the deserted
mole, his comrades gone, mistaken for dead...
COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.)
Come on, then, Private...
The Private looks down at the water to see Commander Bolton
standing in a launch full of army officers.
COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
I know we’re officers, but it’s us
or the enemy, so now’s not the time
to be particular...

76.
The Private scrambles down into the launch, where Colonel
Winnant stands talking to Commander Bolton.
They look out at the vast deserted beach, littered with
corpses and abandoned equipment...
COLONEL WINNANT
(to Commander Bolton)
Churchill got his thirty thousand.
COMMANDER BOLTON
And then some. Almost three hundred
thousand. So far.
Commander Bolton steps back up onto the mole.
So far?

COLONEL WINNANT

COMMANDER BOLTON
I’m staying.
(off look)
For the French.
The launch pulls away from Commander Bolton on the mole.

INT. TRAIN - MORNING
Sunlight flickering on Tommy’s eyelids wakes him. We have the

window, spots a Boy near the tracks ALEX
Hey! Where are we?!
BOY
Siding. You’ll put in in a minute ALEX
What station?
BOY
(surprised)
Woking.
Alex spots stacks of newspapers waiting to be loaded.
ALEX
Grab me one of them papers.

77.
The Boy hesitates.
Go on!

ALEX (CONT’D)

The Boy pulls the paper off the top and stretches up to hand
it to Alex. Alex slumps into his seat. The headline:
CHURCHILL ADDRESSES DUNKIRK EVACUATION
IN COMMONS
Alex thrusts the paper at Tommy.
ALEX (CONT’D)
I can’t bear it. You read it.
TOMMY
Can’t bear it?
ALEX
They’ll be spitting at us in the
streets. If they’re not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

into his seat, turning away from the window...
A Civilian bangs on the glass, peering in...
ALEX
I can’t look,
TOMMY
“But there was a victory inside
this deliverance which should be
noted...”
Alex turns. The Civilian grins, holding up two beer bottles.
The platform is packed with cheering and waving civilians...
Women with sandwiches and drinks rush up to the windows...
TOMMY (CONT’D)
“Our thankfulness at the escape of

“We shall defend our island,

fight on the beaches, we shall
fight on the landing grounds...”
EXT. DUNKIRK HARBOUR - EVENING

“The New World, with all its power
and might -”
The shape of the plane is still visible beneath the flames...

the liberation of the old”.
Move in on the burning Spitfire until the flames fill the
frame and we CUT TO BLACK:
Credits.
