From a BLACK SCREEN
--we’re in the middle of a confidential conversation.
ANDY (V.O.)
The screen says it’s an
unimplemented trap but the dialogue
box is wrong, it’s a system error.
JOANNA (V.O.)
When did it happen?
ANDY (V.O.)
About 10 minutes ago, we’ve been
working it.
JOANNA (V.O.)
An unimplemented trap?
ANDY (V.O.)
It’s a system error.

INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING/CONTINUOUS

We’ll get our bearings in a moment but right now we’re in the
middle of a conversation taking place on a stage between
STEVE JOBS, JOANNA HOFFMAN and ANDY HERTZFELD--all late20’s/early 30’s.
JOANNA
So what’s the upshot?
ANDY
It’s not gonna say “Hello.”
STEVE
It absolutely is gonna say “Hello.”
ANDY
It’s nobody’s fault, (it’s a system
error).
STEVE
(over)
You built the voice demo.
Look--

I can’t.

STEVE
Who’s the person who can?
ANDY
I’m the person who can and I can’t.
STEVE
How bad are you saying?
ANDY
It’s pretty bad.
STEVE
I don’t know what that means.
ANDY
It means (the demo is more than
likely gonna crash).
JOANNA
(over)
You have to keep your voices down,
Joel Pforzheimer is sitting out in
the house.
STEVE
I don’t care if--who’s Joel
Pforzheimer?
JOANNA
GQ. He’s been shadowing you for a
week, did you notice?
Alright.

STEVE

JOANNA
Just look like everything’s fine,
he’s sitting out in the house.
We reveal the 2,600 seat house which in 40 minutes will be
filled to capacity. We’re at the launch of the Mac.

There are hundreds of seats with “Reserved For” signs on them
for the various Apple teams--”Macintosh”, “Apple II”, “Lisa”-as well as hundreds of members of the press--”New York
Times”, “Newsweek”, “Wall Street Journal”, “Financial Times
of London”, “Le Monde”, etc. JOEL PFORZHEIMER is out there,
credentials around his neck, and he gives a small wave to
Steve and so are 50 or 60 ENGINEERS, DESIGNERS and MARKETERS
who are observing the rehearsal from various vantage points.
Way in the back is CHRISANN BRENNAN, 31, and her daughter,
LISA BRENNAN, 5, who’s tucked in a big coat.
STEVE, JOANNA and ANDY are standing in front of a giant
screen showing a slide of the Mac. JOANNA is a beautiful,
brilliant, dryly-funny Polish immigrant who speaks with a
slight trace of an accent. ANDY is a sweet, cherubic young
guy--if you put a bow and arrow in his hands he’d look like
Cupid. Nobody has slept for days.
STEVE
(to ANDY)
Alright, what are your guys saying?
ANDY
Some kind of race condition but we
haven’t been able to track it down
yet.
STEVE
Is the synthesizer sampling fast
enough?
ANDY
No, so the rates are off and it
keeps crashing.
JOANNA
(to STEVE)
It’s 20 seconds out of a two-hour
launch, why not just cut it?
STEVE
We can’t cut it.
JOANNA
Yeah, you just (cut it).
STEVE
(over)
Two days ago we ran a Super Bowl ad
that could’ve won the Oscar for
Best Short Film.

There are more people who can tell
you about the ad than can tell you
who won the game.

JOANNA
I understand, but the ad said the
Mac was gonna save the world, it
didn’t say it was gonna say hello.
ANDREA CUNNINGHAM, a 26-year-old publicist for Apple, calls
from the back-ANDREA
We’re gonna open the house in five.
STEVE
(calling back to ANDREA)
Don’t open the house.
(to the house)
We’re taking a quick break.
ANDY
Part of the problem is---what?

STEVE

ANDY
We can recompile but if it’s a
hardware problem we can’t get into
the back.
Why not?

JOANNA

ANDY
(to STEVE)
You want to tell her or should I?
STEVE
(to ANDY)
Don’t start with me, man.
JOANNA
Why can’t he get into the machine?
ANDY
(to JOANNA)
You need special tools.
JOANNA
What kind of special tools, just
take a screwdriver.

ANDY
He didn’t want users to be able to
open it, you need special tools.
JOANNA
(to STEVE)
Is this for real?
STEVE
There are a hundred engineers
walking around here, none of them
have the tools?
ANDY
In fairness, not many of them were
issued the tools.
STEVE
What about you?
ANDY shrugs-ANDY
I left them at the office, it was
3 A.M and-JOANNA
Oh Jesus Christ--cut “hello.”
No.

STEVE

JOANNA
What’s the first rule of a launch?
STEVE
It’s not gonna crash.
ANDY
It just did.
STEVE
(calling out to the house)
Andy!
Which one?

ANDY

STEVE

ANDREA CUNNINGHAM, the 26-year-old publicist, calls back-Yeah.

ANDREA

STEVE
(to ANDREA)
The exit signs have to be off or
we’re not gonna get a full
blackout.
ANDREA
We’ve spoken to the building
manager and the fire marshal.
And?

STEVE

ANDREA
There’s absolutely no way they’re
letting us turn the exit signs off.
STEVE
I’ll pay whatever the fine is.
ANDREA
The fine is they’re gonna come in
and tell everyone to leave.
STEVE
You explained to the fire marshal
that we’re in here changing the
world?
ANDREA
I did, but unless we can also
change the properties of fire he
doesn’t care.
Steve--

JOANNA

STEVE
If a fire causes a stampede to the
unmarked exits it will have been
well worth it for those who
survive. For those who don’t, less
so but still pretty good.

ANDREA

STEVE
(still to ANDREA)
I need it to go to black, real
black, get rid of the exit signs
and don’t let me know how you did
it.

Fix the voice demo.
STEVE leaves the stage, followed by JOANNA and heads-2

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

JOANNA
You need special tools to open the
Mac?
STEVE
You knew it was a closed system.
JOANNA
I didn’t know literally, Jesus.
JOANNA opens a door marked “STEVE JOBS” and gives STEVE a
push into-3

INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The room’s been set aside as a place for Steve to chill, be
alone and prepare during rehearsals and before the big
presentation.
There’s a Mac (the original Mac) on a small table.
There’s also a large, unopened carton that was recently
delivered.
JOANNA
And if you keep alienating people
for no reason there’s gonna be no
one left for it to say hello to.
STEVE
It’s not for no reason. We blow
this and IBM will own the next 50
years like a Batman villain.
Remember the phone company?

STEVE (CONT'D)
That’s what Bell was called, the
phone company. IBM will be the
computer company and in 10 years
they’ll be the information company
and that’s very bad for the human
race so we don’t have time to be
polite or realistic ‘cause if we
are, this company’s next product
launch will be held in front of 26
people and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shopper’s Guide.
JOANNA
We--listen--we haven’t advertised
the voice software. We could pull
it out of the demo and no one would
be disappointed. Do you want to try
being reasonable just, you know, to
see what it feels like?
STEVE
Okay, pull the voice demo.
Thank you.

JOANNA

STEVE
And then cancel the launch.
JOANNA
I see, you just (tricked me a
little).
STEVE
(over)
You can tell me how unimportant it
is but if the computer doesn’t say
hello then neither will John
Sculley who, I promise you, agrees
with me.
JOANNA
Sculley’s not gonna cancel the
launch ‘cause he’s not insane.
STEVE
He’s also not a hack and when it
comes to the Macintosh he’s gonna
do what I ask him to do. What is in
this box?

JOANNA
Nothing you need to worry about,
don’t even open it.
STEVE opens the flaps on the box and pulls out an issue of
Time magazine. “Machine of the Year” is on the cover with a
picture of a computer. It’s a carton full of copies of Time.
STEVE
(pause)
What the fuck is--why is there a
carton of--who did this?
JOANNA
Somebody thought-Who?

STEVE

JOANNA
--doesn’t matter--thought it would
be a good idea to have copies of
that Time cover available at
everyone’s seat. It was nipped in
the bud and all the copies are
being taken out of the building-they’re probably already out of the
building so...problem solved.
STEVE
This isn’t a Macintosh.
JOANNA
I understand.
STEVE
Somebody thought it would be a good
idea to, like, enthusiastically
hand over copies of Time with a nota-Macintosh on the cover at the
launch of the Macintosh? What are
they handing out at HewlettPackard, a bushel of apples with my
face on them?
JOANNA
I’m sure the thinking was-Yeah?

STEVE

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
CONTINUED:
JOANNA
--that since the computer is Man of
the Year that that’s good for our
business but like I said I’m having
them removed from the building.
STEVE
What I’d like you to do with them
is to take them, all 2600 copies,
and stack them on Kottke’s desk and
tell him Steve says, “Happy New
Year to you.”
Okay.

JOANNA

STEVE
I gave Michael Moritz full access,
the whole campus. Bandley, Apple
II, Lisa, I gave him Sculley,
Markkula, I gave him Woz, I gave
him everybody. Betrayal, thy name
is Michael Moritz and Bozo, thy
name is Daniel Kottke. What should
I call the person who thought it
would be a good idea to hand these
out?
JOANNA
I’m not telling you who it was, it
was done without malice, it’s been
taken care of, you have a half-hour
and we have things to talk about.
Like what?

STEVE

JOANNA
Like a million in the first 90 days-Joanna--

STEVE

JOANNA
Twenty thousand a month after that.
Look--

STEVE

JOANNA
I’m begging you--

STEVE
Those are the forecasts.
JOANNA
--because this is my field. I am
begging you to manage expectations
out there.
STEVE
I’m fanning (expectations).
JOANNA
(over)
We’re not gonna sell a million in
the first 90 days.
STEVE
Everyone, everyone, everyone.
Everyone is waiting for the Mac.
JOANNA
Maybe, but what happens when they
find out that for twenty-four
ninety-five there’s nothing you can
do with it?
STEVE stares at her...
JOANNA (CONT’D)
(pause)
We were competitive at 1500 but
once you replaced the Motorola 6809
with the 68000-STEVE
--which is what supports menus,
windows, point and click, high res
graphics-JOANNA
Yeah, ‘cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.
STEVE
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.
JOANNA
(beat)
I don’t have the first fucking idea
what that means but this is how it
got to $2500.

Okay--

STEVE

JOANNA
Which is the price point on the PC
which can do a lot more.
STEVE
Who’s gonna want a PC once--what
idiot is gonna want--if I need to
tell you there’s a spot on your
shirt I point to the spot, I don’t
say there’s a spot 14 centimeters
down from the collar and 3
centimeters to the right of the
second button while I try to
remember what the command is for
club soda, that’s not how a
person’s mind works.
JOANNA
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should’ve given it some memory.
STEVE
You can complain about memory or
you can complain about price but
you can’t do both at the same time.
Memory is what costs money. And I’m
glad you’re telling me your
feelings about the Mac now because
we have a half-hour left, we can
redesign it.
JOANNA
I’m just asking you to (manage
expectations).
STEVE
(over)
Look at their faces when they see
what it is. They won’t know what
they’re looking at or why they like
it but they’ll know they want it.
JOANNA
Not instantly. When people heard
“Rite of Spring” they tore the
chairs out of the theater, they
didn’t buy the record.

STEVE
“Rite of Spring” happens to be the
most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century.
JOANNA
Yes, exactly, but Igor Stravinsky
didn’t say he was gonna sell 20,000
units a month.
STEVE
It was 1913, there weren’t--I don’t
know why we’re talking about
Stravinsky when-(holding up Time)
--I’ve been properly sodomized by
Dan Kottke in Time magazine.
JOANNA
Look, obviously--let me say this-obviously Daniel didn’t think he
was doing anything wrong.
STEVE
By talking to Moritz about it?
Yeah.

JOANNA

STEVE
What does that mean?
JOANNA
You said--when you told me the
story, you said, “Dan, did Michael
Moritz ask you if I had a daughter
named Lisa?” and Dan said, “Yeah”
and you said, “What did you tell
him?” and Dan said, “Yes.” My point
was that he answered you simply and
honestly because he didn’t think
he’d done anything wrong.
STEVE
(pause)
Except, Joanna, except--I don’t
have a daughter named Lisa!
(beat--picking up the
magazine)
And this story is now about how I’m
denying paternity and took a blood
test!

a PC on the cover instead of a
picture of me and the Mac.

I don’t know what to tell you. I
was supposed to be Time magazine’s
Man of the Year and then Dan Kottke
was born.

auditorium since seven this
morning, she wants to talk to you.
STEVE
How did she get in?
JOANNA
Who was gonna stop her?
STEVE
I’m not having a session with her
right now.
JOANNA
We issued 335 press credentials for
the launch, Steve, you piss off
Chrisann and she’s gonna stand in
the lobby and give 335 interviews
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

if you stay here, she’ll be cool.
JOANNA
I find this all excruciatingly
personal and I’m not staying.
STEVE
I don’t want to be in a room alone
with Chrisann. Come on, this is me

Good to see you.

Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa. We’ve
met before and you told me you
liked the way I talked and that was
my favorite thing anyone’s ever
said to me.
LISA
You’re from Poland.
JOANNA
Yes I am. Do you know where that
is?
LISA
(pointing to the top of an
imaginary globe)
The top of the Earth.

I think you’re thinking of the
North Pole.

Sure.

CHRISANN and JOANNA.
STEVE (CONT’D)

That, actually--do you know what a
coincidence is, Lisa? Like if you
met someone, if you made a new
friend and her name was Lisa too,
that would be a coincidence. Lisa
stands for “Local Integrated System
Architecture”. L-I-S-A. It’s a
coincidence.
JOANNA

You about done?
Yeah.

JOANNA and LISA exit.
CHRISANN
What’s the matter with you?!
STEVE
What’s the matter with you?! Why
are you telling her these things?
Why are you still telling her I’m
her father?
CHRISANN
A judge told her you’re her father-STEVE
No he didn’t.
CHRISANN

telling Time magazine that I’ve
slept with 28% of the men in
America.
STEVE
That’s not remote-CHRISANN
Where do you get off?!

STEVE
I wasn’t saying you’ve slept with
28% of American men, I was using an
algorithm based on the blood test
which said there was a 94.1% chance
that I’m the father.

We’re living in a hovel in Menlo

She’s not my daughter.

Because as reported by Time
magazine I’ve slept with 28% of the
men in America-No.

It should be noted there are a number of people--YOUNG
ENGINEERS--standing around and witnessing Steve beat up Andy.
ANDY
We’re not a pit crew at Daytona,
this can’t be fixed in seconds.

You didn’t have seconds, you had

JOANNA can’t help a smile and small laugh. STEVE looks at
her...
STEVE
Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m
going to announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch
demo--I’m gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up. The bag
was designed by Susan Kare, the
Macintosh font that’s scrolling
across the screen was designed by
Steve Capps, the starry night and
the skywriting was Bruce Horn,
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice, down to
the calculator and then I’m going
to say the voice demo that didn’t
work was designed by Andy
Hertzfeld.
ANDY laughs a little for a moment but STEVE stares at him and
ANDY realizes he’s serious. The others are looking down and
trying to make themselves look busy but there’s no saving
Andy here.
Steve--

ANDY

STEVE
Five in six is your chance of
surviving first round of Russian
roulette and you’ve reversed those
odds so unless you want to be
disgraced in front of your friends,
family, colleagues, stockholders
and the press, I wouldn’t stand
here arguing, I’d go try to get
some more bullets out of the gun.

Do it, Andy.
ANDY nods to his team that they should come with him and get
back to work. As the team starts to walk away, STEVE sees one
of the engineers take a diskette out of his shirt pocket and
a light bulb goes off in his head.

presentation will be projected. Several Macs and their
operators are at tables. We can hear the audience’s energy.
And we can see an ENGINEER with a small crowbar trying to
find a spot to open the back of another Mac while a couple of
other ENGINEERS stand around it with screwdrivers.
What?

STEVE

ANDY
It’s deceptive and borderline
unethical.
STEVE
I’m listening.
ANDY
It’ll run on the Five-Twelve.
STEVE
You tested it?
Yeah.

ANDY

JOANNA
Wait, you’re gonna demo a 128
computer on a 512?
STEVE
Nobody’s gonna know.

JOANNA
(to ANDY)
And you think that’s borderline
unethical?
ANDY
Name my other choices please.
JOANNA
Please--you have to tell me why
it’s so important for it to say
hello.
STEVE
Hollywood. They made computers
scary things.
(pointing to a Mac)
You see how this reminds you of a
friendly face? That the disk slot
is a goofy grin? It’s warm and it’s
playful and inviting and it needs
to say hello. It needs to say hello
because it can.
We hear a few dozen members of the audience--seated up in the
balcony--start to stamp their feet and clap their hands in
rhythm, rock concert style. The few dozen turn into a few
hundred.
STEVE, JOANNA and ANDY silently take it in...
STEVE (CONT’D)
We’re not committing fraud. The 512
is gonna ship in under a year. Will
you absolve me of your Eastern
European disapproval?
JOANNA
(pause--resigned)
The computer in 2001 said hello all
the time and it still scared the
shit out of-STEVE
Absolve me.
JOANNA
Just for this. And just for now.
The house lights go out and we hear the audience break into
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

We hear a WOMAN’s voice over the PA system and see her
speaking into a mic backstage-WOMAN (VO)
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome founding board member, Mike
Markkula.
We see the silhouette of MARKKULA walking to the podium and
we’ll be able to hear his opening remarks without paying much
attention to them.
JOANNA
Alright. Okay. Go make a dent in
the universe, Steven.
STEVE
See you in a couple of hours.
JOANNA heads off and disappears as MARKKULA’s opening remarks
continue. STEVE waits...
STEVE (CONT’D)
(to ANDY)
The last three run-throughs we’ve
introduced the Mac exactly 41
minutes into the-Yeah.

ANDY

STEVE
The clock on the Mac needs to read
9:41.
ANDY
The clock’s gonna read whatever the
time is, it’s a clock.
STEVE takes a moment, nods, and turns to go head to where
he’s supposed to wait backstage.
He sees a welcoming sight--the first one of the day. It’s
JOHN SCULLEY. SCULLEY’s a handsome and easygoing man about 20
years older than Steve. He’s got a bottle of wine and two
glasses. STEVE smiles and walks over to him as the opening
remarks continue in the background.
STEVE hugs SCULLEY and they speak quietly-STEVE
Thank merciful God, the cavalry’s
shown up.

SCULLEY
‘Cause I hear you’ve been worse
than usual this morning and I
didn’t think that was possible. So
I’ve been dispatched to be the
Steve Whisperer. This is a ‘55
Margaux.
STEVE
It’s nine in the morning.
SCULLEY
This is a ‘55 Margaux.
SCULLEY starts pouring two glasses-SCULLEY (CONT’D)
Is it my imagination or have you
started to dress like me?
STEVE
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.
Instead of having Markkula open we
could have just dropped water on
the audience.
SCULLEY laughs a little-STEVE (CONT’D)
You know, just big 10,000 gallon
tanks of cold water dropped from
the ceiling, save Mike some money
on index cards.
SCULLEY
Just relax.
Why?

STEVE

SCULLEY
(pause)
I don’t know, no one’s ever asked
that question.
STEVE laughs a little.

surrounded by enemies.
SCULLEY
You’re not.
STEVE
The board-SCULLEY
The board's behind you.
STEVE
Only because you see to it they
are.
SCULLEY
I think it’s a good board but if
you want me to push ‘em out one by
one we can talk about that.
STEVE
I want you to push ‘em out all at
once. Through a window if it’s the
nearest exit. The looks on their
faces when we showed ‘em the spot?
SCULLEY
I couldn’t see their faces ‘cause
they were banging their heads on
the table.
STEVE
Some of them were frozen like
they’d just seen “Springtime for
Hitler.”
SCULLEY
My highlight was the silence that
was broken by, “It’s supposed to be
a play on the Orwell book, right?”
Yeah, the spot’s called “1984.”

Yesterday, the day after it airs-once--the publisher of Ad Week
calls it the best commercial of all
time. Of all time. And it is and if
anyone ever does one better it’s
gonna be Chiat/Day who the board
wanted to replace and it’s gonna be
Lee Clow who the board thought was
out of his mind. Now listen to
this, you ready?
The “1984” ad starts playing on the screen--we’re seeing it
from behind--and as soon as it starts the CROWD ROARS.
SCULLEY
Yeah speaking of the ad-STEVE
They wanted to fire Lee Clow.
SCULLEY
Did we use skinheads as extras? A
couple of people have told me that.
Yeah.

STEVE

SCULLEY
We paid skinheads? I have skinheads
on my payroll?
STEVE

Not currently I don’t think, but-Why?

SCULLEY

STEVE
They had a look he wanted.
SCULLEY
The skinheads.

‘cause it might offend some of our
customers.

STEVE
Which ones?
SCULLEY
All the ones who aren’t skinheads.
STEVE
My point is they didn’t get it.
SCULLEY
They did not.
STEVE
They didn’t get it, they didn’t
like it, they tried to pull it,
they were wrong, we were right and
that boardroom is a big bowl of
scares-the-living-shit-outta-me.
SCULLEY
I’m running your pass blocking on
the board. Who else knows?
STEVE
Who else knows what?
SCULLEY
That we paid terrorists to be in
our TV commercial.
John--

STEVE

SCULLEY
They were wrong about the ad but
it’s a good board, they’re good
people.
STEVE
Their only problem, their problem
is that they’re people.
People...the nature of people...is
something to be overcome.

STEVE

Chrisann came and she brought Lisa.
SCULLEY
I had a hunch.
STEVE
I’m going back and forth on the
Dylan. I might quote a different
verse.
SCULLEY
What are the choices?
STEVE
“For the loser now will be later to
win,” which is what we have now.
Or?

SCULLEY

STEVE
“It’ll soon shake your windows and
rattle your walls”.
No.

lost a hundred bucks to Andy
Hertzfeld. He said you’d change it
to that verse. We’ve got 45 seconds
left and I want to use it to ask
you a question. Why do people who
were adopted feel like they were
rejected instead of selected?
STEVE
That came out of nowhere.
SCULLEY
“Your sons and your daughters are
beyond your command. Your old road
is rapidly aging. So go fuck
yourself ‘cause my name is Steve
Jobs and the times, they are achangin’”.
STEVE
I don’t feel rejected.
You sure?
Very sure.

SCULLEY

SCULLEY

Yes! Yes! I was (testing you)-(over)
Yeah.

SCULLEY

STEVE
That’s exactly--see?--that’s
exactly what--you’re the only one-God--that’s what I meant. You’re
the only one who sees the world the
way I do.
(beat)
What inspired Hertzfeld to make
that bet?
SCULLEY
He was warning me that being your
father figure could be dangerous.
I can start replacing the board
with more Steve-friendly members.
STEVE
(pause)
It’s having no control.
SCULLEY
You’re the company, you have
control.
STEVE
I wasn’t talking about the company.

You find out that you were out of
the loop when the most crucial
events in your life were set in

But this isn’t Bob Dylan’s version--it’s a woman singing and
instead of an acoustic guitar it’s a slightly fuller and
slightly more up-tempo arrangement. It’s not a Vietnam-era
protest song but a more contemporary and literal statement.

The Macintosh, Apple’s nearmythological home computer, has
gotten off to a rocky start in its
battle with industry-titan IBM.
With sales originally projected to
be a million in the first quarter,
Apple has sold only 35,000 of the
user-friendly machines in the month
since it’s been available to
consumers.

Industry experts sight the lack of

BILL TAHILL (INDUSTRY EXPERT)
The insistence by Steve Jobs that
it have what’s called end to end
control, which is a way of saying
that it’s not compatible with most
outside software or hardware, is
the Shakespearian flaw in a machine
that had potential.

STEVE’s alone on stage in a pool of light. His hair’s a
little shorter now and his haircuts cost a few hundred bucks.
But the real difference is a lighthearted air--an easy sense
of humor.
On a beautifully lit table sits a black cube shrouded in a
black cloth and next to it sits a vase of flowers. Slides
change on the screen in back of Steve to accompany what he’s
saying.
STEVE
Three thousand colleges and
universities in the United States
alone. Over 45 thousand
departments, over 600 thousand
faculty members, over 12 million
students. Stanford’s annual
budget’s 750 million dollars and
growing. The University of Michigan-over a billion dollars and
growing. Ohio State, Cal, Colorado,
UCLA, Georgia Tech--these are
Fortune 500 companies disguised as
George?
STEVE’s calling out to GEORGE COATES, the creative director
of the presentation.
GEORGE
(calling)
Yeah!

GEORGE
You can’t see it from your angle.
STEVE
I’ve seen it from every seat in the
building and from too many of them
does it look like I’m about to
produce a silk scarf. Don’t take it
personally, I’m just not a fan of
the circus aesthetic.
GEORGE
(calling out)
Alright, let’s hold here.
(to STEVE)
We’re gonna have to go up and refocus the instruments.
STEVE

Just one--the 30’s fine.
JOANNA’s walked on stage and is, of course, four years older.
JOANNA
While we’re holding there are wellwishers in the VIP room.
They start heading off stage-STEVE
I like the circus, I love the
circus, but why does it still look
like that?
JOANNA
And Woz is here.
STEVE
Those performers are unbelievable.
They have mastered incredibly hard
albeit not very useful skills--I

revolutionize the circus.

I think it’s cool they’re here.
STEVE
They’re suing me.

Still it was nice they came.
STEVE
They’re not being magnanimous, they

divorce. History doesn’t remember
Joe DiMaggio kindly for dumping

JOANNA makes a suppressed but loud sound while shutting her
eyes and shaking her fists at God.
STEVE (CONT’D)
What’s your problem?
JOANNA
I don’t know but I’m sure it can be
traced back to you. You know I’m
the one who has to explain you to
people. $100,000 to Paul Rand for a
corporate logo when we didn’t even
know what our company made. A

customers are out there thinking,
“You know I’d buy that thing except
I’m not sure I like the color of

Hang on.

You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago, I thought you left.
LISA
I didn’t wake up my mom on time

breakfast but then sometimes I
forget to see what time it is after
that.

There are six sides but you’re not

WOZ
It’s a madhouse out there.
STEVE
Good turnout.
WOZ
Great turnout.
Yeah.

STEVE

WOZ
“Insanely great.”
STEVE
Insanely great.
WOZ
You know this is the first time
ever we haven’t played for the same
team. It’s like you’re releasing
your first solo album. I appreciate
your inviting me to the launch.
STEVE
I just want to wipe the slate
clean.
WOZ
That’s exactly what I want. That’s
why I came backstage. I want you to
know I’ll be out there with you.

STEVE
Any chance I could get you to go
out there instead of me?
WOZ
I love you, Steve.
STEVE
I love you too, Woz.
WOZ
You know--some things were said-They were.

STEVE

WOZ
They were.
(pause)
I’m clumsy at this. I guess-STEVE
They were said in public.
(beat)
Yeah.

WOZ

STEVE
They were published. You knew you
were talking to a reporter from
Fortune, right? You weren’t
tricked?
No.

WOZ

STEVE
(pointing)
Watch your step.
WOZ
Look, I don’t even remember exactly
what I said. I know it was-STEVE
(no problem)
“Steve can be an insulting and
hurtful guy.”
Yeah.

WOZ

STEVE

“--but his integrity I cannot
trust.” Wait here a second.
They’re backstage now and STEVE walks onto the stage where
there’s a new pool of light waiting for him. We stay on WOZ
backstage for a moment, who now understands that Steve’s
version of wiping the slate clean and his are two different
things.
GEORGE COATES calls from out in the house-Good?

GEORGE

STEVE looks at the floor, at the edges of the pool of light-STEVE
Good. Where do you want to pick it
up?
GEORGE
The thesaurus.
STEVE
A word that’s sometimes used to
describe me-GEORGE
Hold please, they’re not cued up.
STEVE
We’ve got about 10 minutes before
we have to clear the house.
GEORGE
I doubt we’re starting on time.
STEVE
I promise you we are.
GEORGE
We still have to get through--

We make computers, we’re--I’ve had
this conversation before--we’re

The giant screen behind Steve is showing the NeXT desktop as
STEVE demonstrates the thesaurus feature.
Go ahead.

GEORGE

STEVE
A word that’s sometimes used to
describe me is “mercurial.”
GEORGE
Hold for laugh.
STEVE
Let’s look at the dictionary
definitions.
(scrolling to it)
“Of or relating to or born under
the planet Mercury.”
(scrolling down)
I think the third one is what they
mean.
STEVE glances offstage where he sees that LISA is now
watching a few feet from WOZ.
STEVE (CONT’D)
“Characterized by unpredictable
changeableness of mood.”
GEORGE
Hold for laugh.
STEVE
If we scroll down the thesaurus,
though, we see the antonym is
“saturnine.” By simply doubleclicking on it we immediately look
that up in the dictionary and here
it is: “Cold and steady in moods.
Slow to act or change. Of a gloomy
or surly disposition.”
GEORGE
Hold for laugh.

STEVE
So I don’t think “mercurial” is so
bad after all.
GEORGE
Let’s jump to 141.
STEVE
Gimme just a second.
STEVE walks to the wings-STEVE (CONT’D)
(to LISA)
It’s against the law for you not to
be in school.
LISA
My mom said I could watch.
STEVE
Where is she?
STEVE leads LISA and WOZ back into-35

INT. CATACOMBS - CONTINUOUS
LISA
Why did mercurial end up not being
a bad word?
STEVE
Do you remember asking me that the
night before last when you were
having dinner at my house?
LISA
I forgot the answer.
STEVE
The word that was the opposite of
mercurial was bad, which meant
mercurial was good.
LISA
I don’t get it.
STEVE
I think you do get it.
I don’t.

LISA

STEVE
‘Cause we also talked about it when
you came to the rehearsal last
week.
LISA
Why aren’t the angles straight?
STEVE
The angles?
LISA
On the Cube.
STEVE
The angles are straight.
LISA
I meant why aren’t they straight on
other things?
STEVE
Why does it feel like you’re
working me?
I’m not.

LISA

STEVE
Woz? Why aren’t the angles straight
on other things?
WOZ
(to LISA)
When the manufacturers make things
with 90 degree angles, they cheat
the angle a little bit--89, 91--so
that it’s easier to get the object
out of the mold. Like getting a
cake out of a pan. But on your
dad’s new computer he insisted the
angles be exactly 90 degrees.
Why?

LISA

WOZ
He’s a perfectionist.
Cool.

CHRISANN
She wants to watch her father’s

STEVE

Wait in here, I’ll be right back.
LISA

I saw the thesaurus.
STEVE closes the door behind her and stands alone in the hall
with WOZ-STEVE
Were you pressured to do it?
WOZ

What do you mean?
STEVE looks around...then WOZ follows him through a doubledoor marked “Authorized Personnel Only” and into-37

INT. ORCHESTRA PIT - CONTINUOUS

37

Empty chairs and empty music stands are arranged in a semicircle facing an empty conductor’s podium.
STEVE looks around at it for a moment...WOZ doesn’t really
know what they’re doing there. STEVE begins walking around
slowly...

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15

STEVE
Check it out. It’s the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera.
WOZ
Was I pressured to do it?
STEVE
I once met Seiji Ozawa at
Tanglewood. Thunderous conductor.
Ungodly artfulness and nuance. And
I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome
can’t do. Surprisingly-WOZ
--he didn’t beat the shit out of
you?
STEVE
(laughing at Woz’s joke)
That’s right. No, he said, “The
musicians play their instruments. I
play the orchestra.”
WOZ
That feels like something that
sounds good but doesn’t mean
anything.
STEVE
Markkula, Sculley, did they ask you
to slag me off in the press?
WOZ
I had reason (to be angry).
(over)
Did they?

STEVE

WOZ
Absolutely not.
STEVE
But they asked you to talk.
WOZ
Apple was under siege, you’d just
left the company, somebody had to
talk to the press.

I’m right here, Woz, the company
left me.
WOZ
I begged you, I begged you. The
Apple II accounted for 70% of
revenue, what’d you think was gonna
happen? You didn’t care enough
about the Apple II or the Lisa.
STEVE
Let’s be really clear, I didn’t
care at all about the Apple II or
the Lisa.
WOZ
I wasn’t pressured to do it. What I
said to the press was an honest if
tempered reflection of what I
believed.
Woz?
Yeah.

STEVE
WOZ

STEVE
What the fuck is on your wrist?
WOZ
You want to know?
STEVE
I literally can’t wait.
WOZ
Everyone’s going to be wearing this
in 10 years. It’s a Nixie Watch
made using Nixie tubes.
WOZ is showing STEVE his watch. It’s a chunky thing that
gives a large digital read-out of the time. The thing is that
the numbers look exactly like the kind of numbers that are on
a time-bomb when it counts down in the movies.
WOZ (CONT’D)
This is actually 40-year-old
technology--cold cathode tubes and
they’re running on 140 volts.

STEVE
Do me a favor--set the watch ahead
like you’re on a plane and changed
time zones.
WOZ
Not a problem.
WOZ unscrews the face of the watch, the MacGyver-bomb numbers
look even worse as WOZ starts to press tiny buttons with the
tip of his pen.
STEVE
Excuse me, flight attendant? The
man next to me would appear to be
detonating a bomb.
WOZ stops...
WOZ
(pause)
You think it looks like a bomb?
STEVE
Even right now I’m not a hundred
percent sure it isn’t.
WOZ
(pause)
Maybe once people get used to-Nope.

STEVE

They sit in silence a moment...
WOZ

maybe)-STEVE

I don’t want to see you dragged off
an airplane in plastic handcuffs,
how is that-WOZ
I get a free pass for life? From
you? You’re the one who gives out
the passes?! You give ‘em to me?!!
STEVE
You’re gonna have a stroke, li’l
buddy.
WOZ
What did you do?! What did you do?!
Why has Lisa not heard of me?
STEVE
Shit, man, how many fourth-graders
have heard of you?
WOZ
You can’t write code. You’re not an
engineer, you’re not a designer,
you can’t put a hammer to a nail. I
built the circuit board, the
graphical interface was stolen from
Xerox PARC, Jeff Raskin was the
leader of the Mac team before you
threw him off his own project...
everything! Somebody else designed
the box! So how come 10 times in a
day I read Steve Jobs is a genius?
What do you do?

I came here to clear the air. You
know why I came here?
STEVE
Didn’t you just (answer that?)
WOZ
(over)
I came here ‘cause you’re gonna get
killed. Your computer is going to
fail. You had a college and
university advisory board telling
you they need a powerful
workstation for 2 to 3 thousand,
you’ve priced NeXT at 6500, which
doesn’t include the optional three
thousand-dollar hard drive which
people will discover isn’t optional
because the optical disk is too
weak to do anything and the twenty
five hundred dollar laser printer
brings the total to twelve-thousand
dollars and in the entire world,
you are the only person who cares
that it’s housed in a perfect cube.
You’re gonna get killed and I came
here to stand next to you while
that happens because that’s what
friends do, that’s what men do, I
don’t need your pass. We go back so
don’t talk to me like I’m other
people. I’m the only one who knows
that this guy here is someone you
invented. I’m standing by you
‘cause that perfect cube that does
nothing is about to be the single
biggest failure in the history of
personal computing.
STEVE wants to tear into WOZ and he considers it for a quick
moment but instead of doing that he says this...

JOANNA
Kids do that when they’re scared
one of their parents is in a bad
mood. They try to get you talking

common and can be treated by
talking to her about things she
likes.
STEVE

will know if she doesn’t already
that that is your primary use for
her and (she will hate you for it

Imprisoned? I can’t get rid of you!

JOANNA comes over--ANDY’s taken a folded-up page from a

JOANNA
Andy, he’s only got a few minutes.
ANDY
It’s Guy Kawasaki writing in
MacWorld, you’re gonna like this.
JOANNA
Can we all enjoy it later?
ANDY
He wrote a parody press release
about Apple buying NeXT for your
OS. He imagines a near-future where
Apple needs your OS and has to buy
NeXT and you come back as CEO. He
has Gates saying there would now be
more innovations from Jobs that
Microsoft could copy. You can read
it later.
STEVE
(taking the article)
Thanks.
ANDY
She would have gotten in without
you donating a building.

the versions are different.
STEVE holds a moment...then sees an opening.
STEVE

What’s the song?
LISA
Okay, so it’s a really old song and
it’s called “Both Sides Now.”
STEVE
“Both Sides Now.”
Yeah.

LISA

That went alright so STEVE tries it again.
STEVE
(beat)
What’s it about?
LISA
(thinks)
It’s about--there are three verses.
Clouds, love and life. And the
person singing is singing that they
used to think of, that they used to
think about, you know-STEVE
--clouds, love and life.
LISA
--right, one way, yeah, but now
they look at them another way and

I can’t diagram that logic but-STEVE
We keep making it so people keep-the Mac needs to sell for $1995.
SCULLEY
There is no market research telling
us the Mac is failing because it’s
overpriced. It’s telling us that
people don’t like it because they
think it doesn’t DO anything, it’s
closed end to end. We didn’t know
it wasn’t what people wanted but it
isn’t, they want slots, they want
choices, they want options. The way
we buy stereos, mix and match

SCULLEY

STEVE
How do you figure?
SCULLEY
We’d bought three spots in the
Super Bowl--two 30’s and a 60--for
six-hundred thousand and after we
screened it the board wanted that
money back and they asked me to
sell off the spots. Chiat/Day sold
off the two 30’s but not the 60 and
I let it be known to Lee Clow that
if he didn’t try very hard to sell
the last spot I wouldn’t be
unhappy. And that’s how the ad got
on the air. Maybe remember that the

The board is tense...even a little bit scared...except

Alright, well...this guy’s outta
control. I’m perfectly willing to
hand in my resignation tonight. But
if you want me to stay you can’t
have Steve. He’ll have to sever any
connection to Apple. Settle him
out. He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.

I’m dead serious, I’d like the

SCULLEY
You’ve done an outstanding job over
the years of cultivating the press
and by that I mean manipulating it
‘cause none of them, and none of
their editors, and none of the
editors’ publishers, to this day,
have any idea that you forced it.
That you forced the board even
after I told you exactly what
they’d do. Which is exactly what
they did. Unanimously.
STEVE
I don’t have any trouble
remembering that, John, because of
it being the worst night of my life
and I forced a vote because I
believed I was right, I still
believe I’m right...and I’m right.
I bled that night and I don’t
bleed. But time’s done its thing
and I really haven’t thought about
it in a while. I absolutely
understand why you’re upset and I
want people to know the truth too.
SCULLEY looks at STEVE...he’s lying.

The thing is, when they sent it up
they didn’t know yet how they were
gonna get it back but they felt
like they were close enough that in
the eight years it was gonna be up
there they’d figure it out. They
didn’t. So after eight years it
lost its orbit and came crashing
down in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean. Little to
the left, little to the right and
somebody coulda gotten hurt.
(beat)
I really wanted to build a computer
for colleges. The technology just
didn’t catch up as fast as I needed
it to. And you know we’re outta
money. But then Apple stopped
innovating and I saw something
better. Joanna, I know schools
aren’t gonna buy a $13,000
dictionary with good speakers, you
know I know that. But Apple will
‘cause Avie Tevanian is gonna build
exactly the OS they need. And
they’re gonna have to buy me too.

Everyone is 10 years older than the last time we saw them.

STEVE’s on stage in front of a giant screen showing changing
slides that reflect whatever he’s mentioning at the moment.
He’s dressed in dark jeans, a white shirt buttoned up to the
neck and a black sport jacket. On a small table, which is in
the dark at the moment, sits a computer under a dark silk
sheet.
STEVE’s loose and having a good time with the hundred or so
employees in the audience who are revved up for the big
morning.

JOANNA
I have the correct time and we’re

A great keyboard and the coolest

the rehearsal audience who are seeing the full production for
the first time laugh.

And now I’d like to show you what
they’re going to look like

STEVE yanks the dark silk sheet off an iMac as a pool of
perfect light comes up on the table.
CHEERS and APPLAUSE from the APPLE EMPLOYEES.

STEVE
I can’t even think of an
appropriate analogy to describe

ANDY
I knew you guys would fix things,
you always do, but in the meantime
if the money wasn’t there she’d
miss a semester of school.
Yeah.

You told Chrisann that Lisa should

Steve, you’re stigmatizing--it’s

ANDY

I did.

I think it’s a miracle she’s not
robbing banks with the Symbionese

Because somebody had to.

ANDY gets up and heads to the door...
ANDY
You threatened me a long time ago.
I’m sorry?

STEVE

ANDY
A long time ago. You threatened me
once.
STEVE
People are attracted to people with
talent and people without it find
that threatening. Maybe you should
see a therapist. It certainly

an eyesore but rather sits on your

lamp--the right computer will be a
bicycle for the mind. A beautiful
object--perfect geometry, perfect
finish, something you want to look
at and have in your home. Flawless.
And then a personal computer
becomes an interpersonal computer.
And what if instead of it being in

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

The hallway’s a little crowded now with Apple employees
lining the walls including JOANNA. They’ll serve as an escort
backstage but right now, coming down the hall toward STEVE---is LISA. At 19 she’s a beautiful young woman with a
striking resemblance to her father. She’s wearing a coat and
has the same headphones around her neck that we saw her in
when she was nine. She’s nothing like a stereotypical
teenager--she’s without affect and only uses irony in very
small doses. We’re aware that she’s ill at ease and selfprotective and uncomfortable.
She walks down the hallway which is lined with “Think
Different” posters that have a picture of the iMac.
STEVE watches her walk toward him--he’s too worn out now to
have a real confrontation with her but he’ll be slowly forced
into it. He takes his arm to move her to the side of the
corridor and he does his best to speak privately while almost
surrounded by people.
STEVE
(speaking quietly in
Lisa’s ear)
I’m paying your tuition. Are you
crazy? Of course I’m paying your

This just went to the next level and JOANNA’s just seen
that...
JOANNA
Guys step away please and give them
some room.
Everyone creates a little more space but total privacy is
really impossible right now.
STEVE

When your mom is 90 and can’t feed
herself you can take care of her.

LISA can’t help but raise her voice a little. She’s not
someone who likes dramatics but she’s upset now. There’s no
way the others are going to be able to avoid hearing this.
LISA
My mother may be a troubled woman
but what’s your excuse?
(beat)
That’s why I’m not impressed with
your story, dad. It’s that you knew
and you didn’t do anything about it
and that makes you an
unconscionable coward. And not for
nothin’ but “Think” is a verb
making “Different” an adverb.
You’re asking people to “Think
