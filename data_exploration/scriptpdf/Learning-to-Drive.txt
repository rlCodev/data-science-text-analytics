EXT. DRIVING TEST SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

1

A small economy CAR proceeds down the street. Driving around
a kiddy park and public swimming pool with kids in the
background. The PLACARD mounted on top says "WINDSOR DRIVING
SCHOOL." We hear a man's voice, with a soft East Indian
accent.
MAN (O.S.)
Make a left.

EXT. DRIVING TEST SITE - STUDENT CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
ANGLE ON SIGNAL LEVER - A BOY'S HAND pushes it down.
STEERING WHEEL - BOYS' HANDS turn it counterclockwise.
MAN (O.S.)
Slow down. Execute a three-point
turn.
THE CAR stops, makes a careful U-Turn.
POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD - approaching a line of parked cars. A
man's FINGER enters frame, pointing to an empty space.
MAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
Park there.
THE CAR slides expertly into the space.
PASSENGER POV - DOOR OPENS, we see the distance to the curb:
six inches. Perfect.
NEW ANGLE - Now we see the car's occupants. At the wheel, a
16-year-old BOY who looks 12. Beside him: a Sikh man, still
handsome in his mid-50's, full beard and sky-blue turban. He
holds himself erect and formal, wears a freshly ironed shirt
and tie. He would seem severe if not for his great warm,
brown eyes. This is DARWAN SINGH.
DARWAN
Mr. Yampolsky, you have followed
all the rules. You will pass your
test tomorrow, I am sure of it.
The boy DRUMS on the wheel, mimes dancing in his seat.

DARWAN (cont'd)
(gentle but firm)
And after you get your license, I
suspect you will buy the biggest,
fastest car...and throw all the
rules out the window.
(boy grins)
It's not a joke. Remember, driving
is a freedom. I wish you to enjoy
every kind of freedom, as long you
don't hurt someone. So follow the
rules. Will you promise me?
BOY
Okay, Mr. Singh.

EXT. WINDSOR DRIVING SCHOOL - LATER - MAGIC HOUR

3

Darwan parks the student car alongside others like it, behind
the Windsor School storefront. He gets out, drops the keys in
a locked box.
4

INT. WINDSOR DRIVING SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER - MAGIC HOUR
ANGLE ON TV SCREEN
We're watching a driving instruction film made in the 60's. A
man (HAROLD SMITH) drives a wide convertible down a boulevard
in L.A. He reviews the five principles of safe driving as
they flash across the screen:
HAROLD SMITH
One: Aim High In Steering. Two: Get
the Big Picture. Three: Keep Your
Eyes Moving.
ANOTHER ANGLE - we're in a small classroom, where Darwan's
BOSS is teaching Drivers Ed. Watching the film are a
HOUSEWIFE, a couple of TEENAGERS, two IMMIGRANT MEN.
Darwan sticks his head in the room. His boss comes to the
rear of the classroom where he hands Darwan his paycheck.
HAROLD SMITH (O.S.) (cont'd)
Four: Leave Yourself An Out. Five:
Make Sure They See You.

EXT. TAXI COMPANY - LATER - NIGHT

TAXI DRIVERS gas up their CABS at a pump beside the garage.
Darwan takes over a CAB from another driver ending his shift.
6

EXT. TAXI - A LITTLE LATER - NIGHT

6

Darwan stands outside of his cab, finishing his supper of
fritters and puffed bread from an Indian deli. A radio
station plays INDIAN POP MUSIC. A KHANDA, a Sikh talisman,
hangs from the rear view mirror.
ANGLE ON HIS ID CARD mounted on the Plexiglass barrier behind
his head. We see his PHOTO and the name "SINGH, DARWAN."
WIDE EXTERIOR - Darwan's cab is parked near the entrance to
the QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE where he can see the alwaysspectacular NIGHT SKYLINE OF MANHATTAN.
The "ON DUTY" SIGN on top of Darwan's cab LIGHTS UP. He pulls
the taxi out and joins the line of CARS inching up to the
bridge.
Close in on the cabs rooftop sign going on and off
continuously, driving around the city. (As if picking up and
dropping off passengers. Until...

EXT. STREET, EAST SIDE - LATER - NIGHT

MAN tears out of an upscale restaurant, his arm up.
Darwan stops. The man (TED) jumps in the back, SLAMMING the
door.
8

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

MAN
Hudson and Jane! Quick!
Darwan throws the meter, touches his foot to the accelerator-when the REAR DOOR FLINGS OPEN again. A Woman (WENDY) hurls
herself onto the seat next to Ted. Both are in their 40's.
WENDY
How dare you run out on me!
TED
You threw a bottle at me.

Darwan drives on, checking his rear mirror nervously. The
woman's face is contorted with anger; the man is stoic.
WENDY
Brilliant maneuver! Inform me our
marriage is over, in a public
restaurant, so I can't make a scene
-- and you thought that would
work?! I wish my aim was better,
you bastard --Her arm swoops out to hit him; he catches her wrist, throws
her back.
DARWAN tries to distract them, to defuse the fireworks.
DARWAN
Excuse me, you said Hudson and Jane
Street?
Yes.

TED

WENDY
(to Ted)
Is that where she lives? You
cocksucker!
TED
I'm not going home with you.
The woman's fury gives way to tears.
WENDY
Why? Why? You can't just -- twentyone years, Ted! How long have you
been lying to me?
TED
I didn't lie.
WENDY
No, you just didn't say anything,
so how could I possibly know
anything was wrong, and now you
blindside me -Ted turns to her, his voice thick with rage, shaking his
finger in her face.
TED
Blindside?! When do you ever notice
anything, Wendy?

TED (cont'd)
On that rare occasion when you look
up from your books or your fucking
computer, you look right through
me! I felt like a ghost!
WENDY
Well, I'm seeing through you now
and you're a prick!
(more sobs; then:)
What is she, one of your students?

He looks out the window, ignoring her.
WENDY (cont'd)
That's as good as a yes. Bet you
"supervised her orals"! Bet she was
on her knees for that! God damn
you -She swings again, and WHOP! connects this time with his eye.
He lets out a YELP, pushes her away, fending off her blows.
DARWAN'S EYES widen in the rear mirror, watching them
struggle.
Ted breaks away, shouting to the driver:
TED
Pull over! Let me out here!
As the cab slows, Wendy clings to Ted.
WENDY
Please! Ted! Come home, we'll talk-TED
It won't do any good.
WENDY
I don't understand -- why? Why?
The taxi stops near the curb.
Ted is out the door, SLAMMING it firmly. He thrusts cash at
Darwan through the window.
TED
Take her to 600 West 98th.
Wendy throws open the door again to follow him. Ted pushes it
closed, blocking it with his body as he calls to Darwan:

TED (cont'd)

Darwan pulls the taxi away quickly. The momentum bounces her
back on the cushion, where she lets out a long, wounded WAIL.
Darwan maintains a pained silence as he drives the woman
home. He glances now and then in the rear mirror to see her
crumpled up and SOBBING without restraint.
9

EXT. WENDY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

9

Darwan pulls up in front of a narrow three-story brownstone.
DARWAN
We are here. Number six hundred.
Wendy stuffs a twenty in his tray and gets out. Her face is
obscured but he can tell she's crying. As she stumbles to her
door, Darwan jumps out with the money.
DARWAN (cont'd)
No, please. He paid me already -But Wendy is already inside, and the door SLAMS shut.
10

INT. FRONT HALL - WENDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

10

Wendy flicks on the LIGHT and stands numbly in the hall. We
get a better look at her. Fierce eyes in a soft, vulnerable
face. Attractive but careless about her looks.
The hallway is lined with bookcases. Piles of messengered
books and mail are on the hall table, and a bowl full of keys
and coins. Seen through an open door, the living room is full
of dusty Danish-modern furniture, and like the hall is
cluttered with books, on shelves and on every surface.
Wendy's eyes fall to the two tennis racquets leaning against
the wall. They lift to the framed PHOTO of her with Ted, a
little girl (TASHA) between them, laughing on top of some
mountain. She shakes her head in mute disbelief.
She walks mechanically to the coat closet. Removing her
jacket, she hangs it up, then pauses at the sight of the
empty hanger for his coat.

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

She opens the door, steps in, and stares at the bed.

WENDY'S POV (FANTASY) - Ted lounges in bed, wearing an old tshirt, grading test papers. He doesn't look up. RUNNING WATER
O.S.... WE PAN TO THE OPEN BATHROOM DOOR. Ted's in there, his
back to her, bare butt peeking from under the torn t-shirt,
brushing his teeth, the faucet running.... FOOTSTEPS BEHIND
HER O.S.
WENDY turns toward the sound, in the doorway.
WENDY'S POV - Ted's going downstairs, into the darkness...A
beat...The front door CLOSES WITH A LOUD REPORT --- shattering her fantasy. She starts to hyperventilate,
gasping for breath. Then she rushes past the empty bed, into
the empty bathroom. We hear her VOMITING into the toilet.
12

EXT. TAXI COMPANY - LATER - PRE-DAWN

12

Back in Queens, Darwan returns the taxi. He removes his
belongings, and checks the rear seat. He sees a PADDED
ENVELOPE ON THE FLOOR. One of his passengers must have left
something.
There is no name on the outside of the envelope. The flap is
open. He slips his hand in and pulls out a new HARDCOVER
BOOK. A letter is clipped to the dustcover.
We SKIM DOWN the letter as he reads. The letterhead is a book
publisher, addressed to a WENDY SHIELDS, The New Yorker,
"Enclosed is a copy of BEATITUDES for your review...." and an
editor's sticky note on top reads: "Messenger to 600 West 98
St."

EXT. STREET, RICHMOND HILL - LATER - EARLY A.M.

14

The envelope tucked under his arm, Darwan walks wearily up a
residential street; past small, drab one-family homes built
in the 30's. Only a few other people are on the street this
early, all bearded MEN in turbans like Darwan, jackets over
long shirts: this is the Punjabi Sikh neighborhood in Queens.
Darwan enters the basement apartment of a two-story clapboard
house, unpainted in a decade.

8/21/13

8.

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER - EARLY A.M.
We TRACK WITH DARWAN through the one-bedroom apartment. He
passes the open bathroom door where a SIKH MAN, barechested
from his shower, winds his turban around his long hair which
is knotted on top of his head.
Darwan glances inside a tiny bedroom, where ANOTHER SIKH MAN
is asleep in the one bed. Darwan's 23-year-old nephew PREET,
dressed in construction clothes, is rolling up his mattress
on the floor.
DARWAN
(WHISPERS)
Preet.
The boy doesn't hear at first, his ears blocked by the
earbuds from the iPod in his pocket.
Preet!

DARWAN (cont’d)

Preet looks up, smiling sheepishly as he pulls out the
earbuds. He joins Darwan in the hallway.
PREET
Hey. I got another job. Big
renovation, four weeks DARWAN
(interrupts; re: iPod)
Where did you get that?
PREET
I paid for it.
DARWAN
Preet, you must save your money.
PREET
(grins)
Uncle D, no. I must have music.
DARWAN
And turn that around.
Darwan is referring to Preet's head wrap which is knotted in
the back gangsta-style.
DARWAN (cont’d)
If you can't wear it properly, then
put on the dastaar. [turban]

Preet wags his finger playfully under Darwan's nose.
PREET
Uncle D, it's past your bedtime.
Darwan has to smile. He raps his knuckle on Preet's head and
lets him go.
As Preet exits for work, Darwan proceeds into the living
room, where a THIRD SIKH MAN is rising from his bed on the
couch. Too tired to talk, Darwan nods at him, taking his
place on the couch while the other man pads, yawning, to the
bathroom.
Darwan PLACES THE PADDED ENVELOPE CAREFULLY ON THE TEA TABLE,
then burrows under the blanket. Darwan then starts
unravelling his turban.

INT. NPR RADIO STUDIO - DAY

16A

An ENGINEER makes last minute adjustments to LAVALIER MICS on
a public radio HOST (50's) and his three guests: HOWARD (70),
ROSE (55) and WENDY, all seated at a round table.
Wendy has made an attempt to pull herself together, but she
seems harried and unfocussed. Self-medication: a very tall
takeout container of COFFEE she's downing.
The Engineer exits to the glass control BOOTH. Rose leans
over to whisper to Wendy.
ROSE
I heard about you and Ted. I'm
really sorry.
WENDY
(recoils)
You heard what, exactly?
ROSE
(on the spot)
Well - that you WENDY
We're just taking a breather, for
God's sake.
ENGINEER (O.S.)
(over squawkbox)
Standby.
The Engineer signals the Host to begin.
HOST
Joining me for today's topic "Are
Critics Necessary?" are three
columnists from the New Yorker:
film critic Howard Mintz, art
critic Rose Belknap, and Wendy
Shields, who reviews books. Let's
start with Wendy. No child dreams
of becoming a literary critic, so
what led you to it?
WENDY
I wanted anything to do with words.
I grew up in a house that was far
from peaceful, and books just...

job to read bad books, too, but the
great ones still carry me off.
HOST
What current authors do you enjoy
reviewing?
WENDY
Well, Martin Amis, Toni Morrison,
uh...Delia Krauss -

Suddenly the other guests go tense, exchanging alarmed
glances; Rose looks dumbfounded.
WENDY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
- I especially love her short
stories. The magazine publishes
most of them Wendy notices the others’ reactions. She laughs uncertainly.
WENDY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
What, nobody likes Delia Krauss?

INT. ELEVATOR BANK - LATER - DAY

ANGLE ON WENDY AND ROSE waiting for the elevator, backs to
camera.
WENDY
DeeDee Krauss?! That whore?!
ROSE
We thought you knew.
WENDY
I thought it was one of Ted’s
students. Now I get it. She was
Writer-in-Residence last year.
(fake-laughing)
She plowed through half the
faculty. We all said DeeDee Krauss
would fuck gravel.
ROSE
Maybe it won’t last. He’ll come
back.

ROSE

Are you heading to the office?
ANGLE ON WENDY - she doesn’t respond for a half-beat, rooted
to the spot, as the shock enters her heart.
WENDY
(distantly)
No, I’m going to work at home...for
a while...
17

INT. STUDY - WENDY'S HOUSE - DAY

17

Wendy sits in an easy chair, humped over a book, rapidly
reading and making notes. There are stacks of review books
everywhere. It's dark and hermetic; her computer SCREEN GLOWS
on the desk, amid coffee-stained mugs, plates with food
crumbs.
Mom?

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Wendy looks up.
18

INT. FRONT HALL - WENDY'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - DAY
Wendy comes down the stairs. Her daughter (TASHA, 19) stands
at the bottom, having just let herself in.
Tasha!
Hi, Mom.

Wendy digs in the bowl on the hall table for change.
WENDY
You must have had a long drive.
TASHA
Five hours. Fantastic weather. I
listened to Vampire Weekend the
whole way.
WENDY
(giving her quarters)
Ugh, not one of those stupid
paranormal books.
TASHA
(LAUGHS)
It's a band. You're such a ditz.
19

INT. KITCHEN, WENDY'S HOUSE - LATER - DAY

19

The counters are cluttered with takeout cartons and dirty
dishes. As her daughter chatters, Wendy washes out two mugs
while the water kettle heats up.
TASHA
They don't use any chemical sprays
or fertilizers. I love being up in
the tractor, I love the air and the
smells, I love dirt. Growing up in
the city I always thought dirt was,
like, grime. But their dirt is
alive, you know, it's rich, it's
nourishing --I just want to eat it.
WENDY
Nostalgie de boue, is what the
French say.
TASHA
(rolls her eyes)
Whatever. I want to skip the fall
semester so I can stay for harvest.

WENDY
Did you ask your father?

The question hangs there. The kettle WHISTLES. Wendy makes no
move, as if she doesn't hear it. Finally Tasha turns off the
fire. The WHISTLE DIES. Tasha pours water in the mugs.
TASHA
He said to ask you.
WENDY
Stands to reason, seeing I'm the
one paying your tuition. Well, do
as you like. Vermont suits you. You
look dangerously healthy.
TASHA
Mom, come stay with me. They'll put
you up on the farm. It's a great
place to write.
WENDY
The train's clear over on the other
side of the state, and I can't very
well drive up without a license.
TASHA
So get one!
WENDY
Tasha, please let’s not get into
that, not again, not now.
TASHA
But don't you want to get away?
There's so many memories in this
house -Tasha's voice catches. Her eyes fill up with tears.
Baby...

WENDY

Wendy puts her arms around her daughter, stroking her back.
WENDY (cont'd)
Why are you crying?
TASHA
When I think of you and Dad not
together, it's so sad. And you're
here all alone --

WENDY

Tasha sniffs back tears. Wendy absently hands her a crumpled
napkin with traces of duck sauce from the table.

Eew.

TASHA
(pushes it away)

WENDY
Please don't be so upset.
TASHA
I thought you'd be upset.
Wendy sets a tray as she breezily dismisses Tasha's concern.
WENDY
We've weathered this before. Every
seven years, the itch comes over
him. He gets restless, does
something juvenile. So, at twentyone years, we're on our third itch.
Or it's male menopause. Instead of
buying a a motorcycle, Daddy
decided to give adultery a spin.
As she heads into the living room with the tray:
WENDY (cont'd)
Tell you what, when he comes home,
we'll drive up to visit you.
20

INT. LIVING ROOM, WENDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

20

The living room is as dark as the study, the couch covered
with newspapers, the coffee table with unopened mail and
dirty plates. Arranging the tray on the table, Wendy sits,
but Tasha remains standing.
TASHA
Mom...Dad's not coming home.
WENDY
Look around. He didn't take his
books. What does that tell you?
TASHA
He said he filed for a separation
already.

Wendy covers her shock by pouring tea.
WENDY
And he uses you to deliver that
message? Nice of him to manipulate
you.
She sips her tea but it burns her tongue. She BANGS her mug
down and erupts.
WENDY (cont'd)
I hope she knows she'll have to pay
for his keep. Because he is a
loser. In twenty years he couldn't
get tenure. How anyone besides me
could consider him romantic
material is stupefying.
TASHA
So you are upset.
WENDY
No I'm not. I'm disgusted.
Beat.
WENDY (cont'd)
You're staying for dinner?
TASHA
Actually, I said I'd eat with Dad.
WENDY
(fury rising again)
So this is just a visit. You're
popping by to see if Mom's a basket
case? And then run that message
back to him? Thanks. You can go
now.
Wendy gets off the couch, striding to the door.
Mom -- ?

on the night table.
The DOORBELL rings O.S.: DING-DONG.

INT. FRONT HALL - MINUTES LATER - DAY

Hair matted, bathrobe askew, Wendy opens the door. She peers
blearily at the solemn bearded man in a scarlet turban on her
doorstep. He hands her a padded envelope.
DARWAN
You left this in my cab.
WENDY
Oh. Okay. Just a minute.
She puts the envelope on the pile of books on the table, and
brings the change bowl to the door, scooping a handful of
change to give to him. She stops, seeing his look of dismay.
WENDY (cont'd)
What am I doing? That's pathetic.
(replaces bowl)
Let me get you some real money.
DARWAN
I don't want anything. I like to

York.
DARWAN
Yes, I am. From Queens.
WENDY
That's not New York. But you're
very nice, and I thank you. Are you
sure I can't give you something?

He shakes his head, bowing slightly, his palms together. Then
he turns, heading back to the car double-parked in front of
her house. More awake now, she focusses for the first time on
the placard mounted on his car: "WINDSOR DRIVING SCHOOL."

He buckles his seat belt and STARTS THE CAR. Suddenly, she's

Wendy talks on the phone to Tasha. She has DARWAN'S CARD in
her hand.
WENDY
Baby, I'm sorry for what I said.
You're right, I need a change of
scenery. So guess what? I'm going
to get my license, buy a car, and
drive up to see you, sweetie. And
we'll eat some dirt together, OK?

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Darwan sits alongside Preet and two of his ROOMMATES on the
couch, watching a CRICKET GAME on TV. The third ROOMMATE
irons his shirts on the table.
They might be a bunch of guys watching the Super Bowl, but
instead of baseball caps they wear the Sikh at-home
headcover, a simple dew-rag knotted on top;

He removes his shoes, inserting them in a cubbyhole. OTHER
SIKH WORSHIPPERS are doing the same. He follows them into:
29

INT. PRAYER ROOM, GURDWARA - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

29

This is a long, carpeted room. MEN in turbans and WOMEN with
scarves sit on the floor meditating, praying, or listening to
the MUSICIANS SINGING verses from the Holy Book (Granth
Sahib) which lies open on a low platform next to them. A
WORSHIPPER sits before the Book, reading its Punjabi text;
ANOTHER flicks a horse-hair switch above him (traditionally,
to ward off flies and dust).
Darwan approaches the book with palms together (namaste),
kneeling and bowing.
The Worshipper rises and takes his turn with the switch,
while Darwan sits before the Book and reads...
We hear the sound of the music playing. We also see kids ages
six or seven seated in an a spacious room taking a Tabla
class with an Old Tabla Teacher.

Darwan shares tea, food and CHAT with other WORSHIPPERS

Darwan waits at the front door, his ear to the intercom. A
blast of STATIC, then Wendy's voice:
WENDY
(INTERCOM filter)
Who is it?
DARWAN
Darwan Singh. For your driving
lesson, please.
WENDY
Oh my God...
INTERCOM BUZZES him in.

INT. FRONT HALL - WENDY'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - DAY
Darwan gazes around, noting the clutter and the dust.
Wendy arrives at the foot of the stairs: pallid, wearing
black sweats this time, her reading glasses atop her head and
tangled in her hair.
WENDY
I completely forgot. Anyway I've
changed my mind about lessons.
DARWAN
Why, if I may ask?
WENDY
Look, I'll pay you for today. I'm
really sorry.

WENDY
Uh, I'm in the middle of work.
DARWAN
Let me do my job just a little.

ANGLE ON KEY IN CAR IGNITION - WENDY's hand turns it

DARWAN (O.S.)
First position turns on the
electrical system. Now second
position...
Wendy turns the key further. The motor THRUMS to life. ANGLE
ON MIRRORS - REAR, LEFT SIDE, RIGHT SIDE.
DARWAN (O.S.) (cont’d)
Next, you have three mirrors. Rear
view, left, and right -WENDY
(interrupts)
I really don't need to learn this.
My husband drives.
DARWAN
I never learned to cook because I
thought my mother would always be
there to cook for me. She is gone,
and I am here, so I make my own
food.

Darwan coaches her from the passenger seat.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Put on your left signal.
Wendy gropes for the signal post and turns on the wipers
instead.
WENDY
Damn. Where is it?
He indicates the signal. She flicks it down.
DARWAN
Now turn the wheel all the way to
the left.
(she obeys)
Now the gas pedal.
The car moves forward a mere foot -- she brakes suddenly.
DARWAN (cont'd)
What's the matter?
WENDY
We're moving.
DARWAN
That's good.
WENDY
I think I don't like this.
DARWAN
(twinkles)
Well, you have to go forward now
because I haven't taught you how to

Darwan looks over Preet's shoulder at the screen.
ANGLE ON CELL SCREEN - A CANDID PHOTO OF AN PUNJABI WOMAN,
about 40, gazing stiffly at the camera as if for a passport
picture.
DARWAN
She looks sour. She would complain
a lot.
PREET
Every time you find something
wrong. How many more years until
there's no one left and you're
still alone? In your head, I think
you're still in prison, Uncle D.
DARWAN
(roughly)
Be quiet! Never speak to me like
that again!
Cowed, Preet shuts up.
DARWAN (cont’d)
You were just a skinny scared boy
when I took you in. I promised your
mother to help you and now you give
me cheek, and disrespect.
They walk for a beat in silence. Cooling off, Darwan manages
a smile.
DARWAN (cont’d)
You were stinky, too. Smeared all
over with garlic paste.
PREET

I/E STUDENT CAR - ANOTHER DAY

With Darwan beside her, Wendy guides the car slowly up
Broadway, where TRAFFIC is convoluted and aggressive.
DARWAN
Teach yourself to see everything.
Your eyes should go from sidewalk
to sidewalk, and one block ahead.
A MONTAGE OF IMAGES FROM THE ROAD AHEAD - LANE MARKINGS,
TRAFFIC LIGHTS, CONSTRUCTION BARRIERS...
DARWAN (cont'd)
You see the markings on the road,
the lights, you read the signs...
RAPID-CUTTING SEQUENCE OF SHOTS OF SIGNS: "QUIET ZONE," "ONE
WAY," "NO LEFT TURN 4 PM TO 7 PM," "ALTERNATE ROUTE," "TO
EAST SIDE," STREET NAMES, SIGNS WITH SYMBOLS, ARROWS, BLOCKED
ARROWS -WENDY (O.S.)
There's too many to read.
DARWAN (O.S.)
It comes with time.
POV - PASSING PEOPLE: A WOMAN WITH STROLLER steps off the
curb; a DELIVERY MAN opens his van door; a SKATEBOARDER
curves across the lane; KIDS around an MISTER SOFTEE TRUCK...

A BICYCLE MESSENGER APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE, CUTS IN FRONT of
the car. Wendy YELPS, pumping the brake.
DARWAN (cont'd)
...and smoothly adjust so you can
stay out of their way. The driver's

WENDY'S POV - PANNING TOWARD HAPPY COUPLES eating at sidewalk
cafes, young couple kissing on the curb. A male gay couple
holding hands and an old couple arguing.
SAFETY BRAKE - DARWAN'S FOOT comes down hard.
DARWAN
That's a red light.
Wendy snaps to attention, looks up: sure enough, she almost
went through a RED LIGHT. She jokes to cover up her
embarrassment.
WENDY
Isn't it strange, that red has come
to mean "stop" and "danger"? It
strikes me that stopping is when
you're safe, whereas going is
dangerous.
DARWAN
Don't talk, Wendy. When you talk,
you don't see.
He points her eyes up. The LIGHT IS GREEN. Cars behind HONK.
Wendy drives on, trying to stay focused.
DARWAN (cont’d)
Get in the left lane.
Slow...Signal.
WENDY gropes, finds the signal this time.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Read the signs...See everything...

Don't you love me anymore?
He shakes his head: no.
WENDY (cont'd)
But why? How did I fail you? What
should I have done?
When he opens his mouth to speak, the voice is Indianaccented.

Pay attention!

Ted is gone, Darwan is beside her.

DARWAN

He's pointing up to the GREEN LIGHT.
Rattled, she tromps on the pedal and the CAR LEAPS FORWARD.
DARWAN BRAKES on his side. The car avoids hitting a JAYWALKER
with his iPod on loud.
Oh my God!

WENDY

She drops her hands to her lap helplessly with a GROAN of
frustration; lowers her head.
DARWAN
Why didn't you see him?

Darwan and his nephew Preet huddle around his cell phone.
Darwan is talking to his sister RASBIR (Preet's mother, mid40's) on FaceTime: she is seen in closeup on the phone's
screen.
RASBIR
She's not young but she can still
have one or two children.
DARWAN
Why hasn't she been married?
RASBIR
She was engaged once but the police
shot her fiance, just like they did
to our Sameer. Then her father was
ill for a long time and needed her
at home. Now he's dead and she has
nowhere to go.
PREET
(to Darwan)
She's perfect!

DEBBIE
Well hallelujah, sis, it’s about
time you learned to drive.
WENDY
I’m just doing it for Tasha, not
because I need to.
As they move to a pair of wooden chaises to sit and eat:
WENDY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
But you have to drive, Debbie,
you’re in the suburbs. Here I have
the subway, buses, taxis...
(they sit)
I also used to have a husband who
drove.
DEBBIE
(shakes her head)
Ted. Such a creep - but you know? I
can believe it. On my street alone
we’ve had three divorces caused by
philandering.
WENDY
(starts eating)
Oh well, Greenwich.
DEBBIE
(inspecting the shwarma)
What I don't understand is: how can
they cheat on their wives and still
live with themselves? I mean, it's
like pissing in the pool. Maybe
nobody saw you do it, but you know
the yellow's in the water. And you
have to swim around in it,
pretending it's clean.
Debbie manages to give Wendy the giggles.

sluts? Is there a vending machine?

Maybe that's all Ted ever really
wanted.
DEBBIE

shwarma)
Honestly, it's nirvana for them.
WENDY

Then why don't we do it?
DEBBIE
It's too much work. Why do you

The two break up, laughing harder and harder, trying to keep
their food from flying out of their mouths.

Wendy meets with her divorce ATTORNEY at a table in an empty
conference room.
WENDY
He wants "support"?!
ATTORNEY
Or a twenty-five percent share of
your income. He claims he supported
you while you pursued your career.
I know, I know -He raises a hand to forestall her rage; it doesn't work. She
POUNDS the table with her fist.

ATTORNEY
He'll let you stay in the house if
you buy him out.
WENDY
I can't possibly afford that.
ATTORNEY
Or split fifty-fifty if you sell.
WENDY
I have to move out?! I am that
house. It's like asking me to move
out of me.
ATTORNEY
Maybe it's too big now?
WENDY
I can't believe this. It's where we
raised Tasha, where we were
happy....
Her voice trails off. She realizes the word "happy" is now
moot. Obsolete.
WENDY (cont’d)
Okay. It's where we were idiots,
and squandered our marriage, and
never made love when we should have
and never fought when we should
have, and we read and read and read
and went totally fucking blind and I want my house! I want to stay
where I am!

Pausing outside his door, Darwan hears MEN'S VOICES within
speaking English.
TIGHT ON DARWAN - His face is suddenly bathed in sweat, his
breathing ragged.
XCU - HIS HAND goes slowly to the door knob. Before he can
turn it:
THE DOOR BANGS OPEN. Two of Darwan's Sikh Roommates emerge,
escorted roughly by two official-looking men (IMMIGRATION
AGENTS). His roommates look at Darwan with helpless dread as
they are rushed past.
A third AGENT brings up the rear, stopping short when he sees
Darwan.
AGENT
(flashes badge to Darwan)
I.N.S. Who're you?
DARWAN
I am Darwan Singh. American
citizen.
AGENT
Let's see your papers.
With unsteady hands, Darwan removes his driver's license from
his wallet. The Agent examines it.
AGENT (cont'd)
How come they let you in, Darwan?
DARWAN
Political asylum.
AGENT
(checks the year)
2000...you got in just under the
wire.
The Agent brusquely hands back the license and exits.
Left alone, Darwan rushes into the living room. His
roommates' half-finished tea stands on the table. An INDIAN
SOAP OPERA still plays on the TV. The closets stand open,
their contents strewn on the floor, the sofa upended,
indicating a forcible search of the premises.

where he hid by contorting himself into an impossibly tight
ball. He spills onto the bath mat, one foot still stuck in
the plumbing. Darwan helps him up.

They took Teji and Raam. Thank God

I'll find us another place PREET
I'm going to live with my
girlfriend in Chinatown.

them. Especially when you drive.
She comes to a stop at the intersection.
DARWAN (cont'd)
You are on top of the crosswalk.
Next time stop where you can see
the lines.
ON WENDY - grits her teeth. The constant stream of criticism,
even delivered in Darwan's neutral tone, is getting to her.
Traffic moves again. Suddenly a SPORTS CAR ZOOMS past, angles
abruptly in front of her, inches from the bumper, cutting her
off. Wendy POUNDS THE HORN.
WENDY
God damn it!
DARWAN
Don't lean on the horn. It's not a
boat. Just a short tap.
WENDY
Why do men have to do that? Wag
their balls in your face.
DARWAN
(controls his shock)
I think it is time to discuss road
rage. You must learn to be calm and
relaxed, not only to drive but in
your life as well.

from school.
DARWAN
Be careful to see every person
before you. They may not have the
right of way but you are the one
driving a deadly weapon...
He looks over. Wendy has a glazed look he has come to know
well. She doesn't notice she's rolling right through a STOP
SIGN.
DARWAN'S HAND WRENCHES THE WHEEL FROM HER.
THE CAR pulls over to the curb.

The urgency in his voice makes her turn back to him. She is
surprised to see the depth of compassion in his eyes,
although she has spent the lesson baiting him.

Wendy, how do you know if you've
put in enough salt and pepper when
you are making a beef stew?
WENDY
You taste it?
DARWAN
Right. So what do you do if you've
lost track of the way the car is
pointing when you parallel-park?
WENDY
You taste it?
DARWAN
You just let the car move back a
tiny bit and see which way it goes
-- you taste the direction.
WENDY
And then you correct the seasoning?
DARWAN
Right. You adjust a little bit, and
a little bit -- and now I've made
myself hungry. I will go home and
make myself a curry.
She smiles wanly, preoccupied.

You look very nice today.

WENDY
My husband gave me that on our

He'd mark a certain love poem and
ask me to read it while he lay his

It's a sweltering day: muggy, yellowish sky. Even with the
windows rolled down, Darwan and Wendy are drenched in sweat.
She drives east along Central Park South, passing
SKATEBOARDERS with their shirts off; JOGGERS pouring Evian
over their heads; mobs of CHILDREN around the ICE CREAM
SELLER. HORSES with drooping heads hauling carriages of
TOURISTS. A PEDI-CAB DRIVER pedals stoically in the heat
alongside her.

The car creeps forward. The LIGHT CHANGES before she has
reached the opposite side of the intersection. Now the CROSS
TRAFFIC APPROACHES and she's "blocking the box." More
HONKING. Wendy and Darwan shout above the noise:
WENDY
Why are you forcing me to do this?!
DARWAN
Because I know what you can do
better than you!
His calm obstinacy infuriates her, but there's no choice: she
must drive ahead, and that means mounting the bridge. Her
fingers tighten on the wheel.
GREEN LIGHT. She drives forward, slow as a tortoise.

Hi, Dad. Well, here I am. Sitting

Sleep in the back. Heat up a TV

shower.

She GIGGLES.

Pee in the gas tank. And when the
spirit moves, you just drive away.

People think I look dangerous. But
this is how I know who I am. And
here it is too easy to forget.
WENDY
Don't you go back for visits?
DARWAN
I can never go home to India. It's
part of political asylum. I could
not see my father before he died
last year.
WENDY
I didn't get a chance to say
goodbye to my dad either.
DARWAN
I missed my mother's funeral, too,
but that was when I was in prison
there.

Why?

WENDY
(taken aback)

DARWAN
For nothing. For being a Sikh. The
police had already killed my
brother. They said he was a
terrorist, and they had to shoot
him because he ambushed them, but
it was a lie. Then they punished
the rest of the family. All of us
were tortured, my father, my uncle,
even my mother. They let my sister
alone because she was too young.
Back then there was no justice for
Sikhs.

Driver punches his Darwan's turban off; KICKS the side of the
student car, leaving a dent. PASSENGER restrains DRIVER;
Darwan, humiliated, scrambles to retrieve his turban from the
ground where it has unraveled. His long hair (which has never
been cut, according to Sikh tradition) swings free, a skinny
rope uncoiling to the small of his back. He looks suddenly,
shockingly, naked without the turban.
PASSENGER (cont’d)
Stop! Can we just do the insurance
cards and get the fuck outa here!

His turban is askew, and the end of the soggy cloth has come
loose, hanging over his eyes so he has to swat it away.
The pavement empties. Then DARWAN spots a small, plump 30something INDIAN WOMAN about 50 feet away, sitting alone on
her LUGGAGE; on her lap is a clear plastic garment bag with a
long ornate red gown inside.
He holds up his sign hopefully, but she makes no sign of
recognition.
As he approaches her, she glances up, bleary from the flight.
Jasleen?
Darwan?

DARWAN
JASLEEN

She seems a bit stunned. He realizes he could not look worse,
dishevelled and drenched, his shirt sticking to his skin, his
turban askew and unravelling.
DARWAN
Hello. Did you not see my sign?
(she looks confused)
Never mind. Here is for you.
He hands her the flowers and the wrapped gift.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Please, open it.
She unwraps the paper. She stares blankly at the book inside.
DARWAN (cont'd)
These are beautiful poems for you
to read. William Wordsworth!
JASLEEN
(ill at ease)
Thank you, mister.
DARWAN
(LAUGHS)
No mister! We will speak only
English now, for practise. You will
learn fast.
She gives him a box of Indian candy from her tote.

He waits for her to say more, but she's like a deer in the
headlights.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Now I will show you New York!
He offers to take her garment bag, but she won't release it.
He picks up her three suitcases, staggering to the car. She
follows, arms full of flowers, garment bag, and poetry book.

INT. JFK PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

82

As they approach his car, he's acutely aware of what she
sees: the dented door, the smashed rear, the placard askew;
and an attractive middle-aged Caucasian woman waiting beside
the vehicle.
DARWAN
(flustered)
It's a little accident we had.
That's my student, Wendy. Wendy,
this is Jasleen.
Hi.

WENDY

Jasleen looks at her suspiciously.
JASLEEN
Hello, miss.
WENDY
(tactfully)
I'll get in the back.
Wendy is hunkered in the rear. Darwan piles Jasleen's luggage
to the ceiling next to her.
DARWAN
(to Wendy; petulant)
I cannot put these in the trunk
because it is filled with rain.
His movements are nervous; he is now so upset he seems
unhinged. He goes to take the garment bag from Jasleen, who
first clings to it.

Hang this on the hook.
As Wendy hangs the bag on the hook over her door, Jasleen
turns her head to watch, frowning.
JASLEEN
My dress...
DARWAN
(climbs into driver seat)
It's her wedding dress.
WENDY
(to Jasleen)
Oh, you're getting married?
Jasleen doesn't answer.
DARWAN
Speak slowly so she understands.
WENDY
(to Jasleen)
You get married?
DARWAN
Yes. Tomorrow. We are very happy.
Wendy is stupefied.
You two?

He is speaking so fast, Jasleen can't understand; she can
only cringe against her door, witnessing his anger with no
idea of the cause.
The car heads out of the parking lot.
DARWAN (cont’d)
(to Jasleen)
We must take Wendy home first.
(gestures out window)
Look, here is America!
Jasleen sees nothing outside but bleak concrete and sterile
streetlights through a scrim of humid exhaust.
WENDY
Excuse me, you've never met her?
DARWAN
She's from a village near where I
grew up. My sister picked her out
for me.
WENDY
(sitting back)
If my sister picked me a husband,
he'd be some dickless Republican
banker.
DARWAN
(sarcastic)
Yes, you are better off!
(mutters)
That's why you're alone and crazy.
WENDY
Listen, just drop me at the subway.
He SWERVES around ANOTHER CAR, thrusting the women against
their doors, while he shakes his finger back at Wendy:
DARWAN
No! You are my guest! You don't

DARWAN and JASLEEN stand before the GIANI, or priest, and the
HOLY BOOK. Members of the WEDDING PARTY, all Darwan's
friends, are dressed in a riot of colors: flame, fuschia,
saffron, emerald; the men in turbans and long shirts of
rainbow hues.
Jasleen, heavily made up, with henna'd hands, wears her
scarlet wedding dress and gold bangles; Darwan wears a
scarlet turban and ceremonial sword.
Darwan holds one end of a saffron sash, Jasleen the other, as
he leads her four times around the Holy Book. The Priest and
MUSICIANS SING the sacred couplets which accompany each tour:
PRIEST
(first round)
"Thus the Lord imprints the duties
of married life..."
Preet grins, winks at him as he passes by.
PRIEST (cont'd)
(second round)
"Thus the Lord leads you to your
Divine Guide..."
Jasleen follows three steps behind Darwan, staring at her
feet so as not to trip.

mind..."

The wedding GUESTS dance exuberantly, under colored LIGHTS,

DARWAN is dancing, too. JASLEEN looks on shyly from the
sidelines. Her eyelids droop: she's very tired and she
doesn't know anyone.

Wendy's taking books from the shelves to pack in open
cartons. A tragic OPERA plays faintly on a PBS station.
Wendy's mood is correspondingly stormy.
WE FOLLOW HER FEET as she approaches a box, then LINGER ON A
BOOK lying open on the floor. It's the YELLOW PAGES, open to
"DRIVING INSTRUCTION." A few ads are half-heartedly circled.
When her feet return to frame, she abruptly KICKS the book
aside.
She carries the GLASS-SHADED MOROCCAN LAMP to a box filled
with bubble wrap. She raises the lamp carefully, turns, and
with all her force SMASHES it on the floor.
She throws herself onto the couch, curling into a ball, her
hands covering her head. Then she hears a FAINT NOISE O.S.:
something brushing against the front door. Retreating
FOOTSTEPS on the stoop outside.

Approaching the car:
WENDY
How was the wedding?
She can't help the hint of jealousy in her voice. He doesn't
notice.
DARWAN
It's a very, very beautiful
ceremony. It says when a man and a
woman marry, they become one
spirit. We think and feel the same,
there's no difference between us.
WENDY
You don't mention love.
DARWAN
Of course. Love is the one road to
God. God doesn't want anyone to be
alone.
She raises a sardonic eyebrow. He opens the driver's door for
her to get in.

married to a complete stranger?

Jasleen irons Darwan's shirts; glances now and then at the
curious images on TV, where a hefty WOMAN tearfully smacks
and punches a beefy GUY beside her on a Maury Povich-type
show. The subtitle, which she can't read, is: "HER BOYFRIEND
MAKES HER WATCH HIM HAVE SEX WITH HIS WIFE."

Lying on the couch, she watches "SESAME STREET," featuring
the letter "P." A short animated sequence teaches the word
"Peligro" (danger). Jasleen mouths the word:

The Male Friend stands to pull out Wendy's chair for her.

DEBBIE
I have no idea! He was hard to

people are alone: because they
deserve to be. I ignored my
husband. I ignored my daughter. No
wonder he cheated on me. I mean, I
openly cheated on them. Because my
first and foremost love was for
words. Words! I wrapped myself in
them. And then I look at you.
He glances up.
There's a thousand things in this
world to divide two people, but you
and Jasleen manage to be one
spirit. Whew!
(calls to WAITRESS)
Miss!
She gestures her glass for a refill, well on her way to a
good drunk. Then she leans in closer.
WENDY (cont’d)
Just tell me: if she ever
disappointed you, if she ever fell
short in some way...would you ever
cheat on her?
DARWAN
No. I would never.
WENDY
Well, Darwan, you're a good man.
You give me faith.
He drops his eyes to his coffee. In the silence, the waitress
sets down Wendy's wine and departs. He doesn't look up.
WENDY (cont'd)
I don't even want this.
She pushes her glass away abruptly.
DARWAN
(softly)
I don't know how to talk to her.

Her turn to be silent. Almost afraid to breathe, she waits
for more.
DARWAN (cont'd)
She's not educated. We don't like
the same things at all. She's
scared of America. She's scared of
me. She hides. You know words,
Wendy. What do I say?
She thinks. When she speaks at last, it's from the bruised
heart.
WENDY
That you'll never stop trying. That
you'll fight for her. Every day,
you'll try to cross the divide.
Tell her she's worth it.
DARWAN
Is this what you wanted to hear
from him?
She SIGHS, averting her eyes to hold tears at bay.
WENDY
Not words. You know what I miss?
The way he touched my face.
Just...holding my face between his
two hands. As if I was treasure.
They sit, as still as two people in prayer, allowing her
sorrow to fill up the silence.

I/E STUDENT CAR #2 - LATER - NIGHT
Darwan pulls the car up in front of Wendy's house.
WENDY
(rummages in purse)
Shit. Can you come inside? I left
my checkbook at home.
DARWAN
You can pay me next time.
WENDY

No next time. I'm done with
driving.

Wendy writes out a check while Darwan tries to persuade her.
DARWAN
You shouldn't give up. You only
need a little more practise.
WENDY
I don't have it in me, Darwan. I'm
sorry.
She hands him the check.
DARWAN
You make me say goodbye.
WENDY
(suddenly uncertain)
I guess...yeah.
He bows reluctantly, namaste, his palms together.
WENDY (cont'd)
Thank you. You did your best.
DARWAN
Not enough.
A beat. He slowly brings his hands toward her. And gently
touches the sides of her face. As if she is treasure.
She releases a pained breath. She turns her face into his
touch, leaning one cheek on his palm.
He pulls his hands away. His face shows the struggle within.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Goodbye, Wendy.
Wendy watches as he leaves.
FADE OUT.

INT. BATHROOM, BASEMENT APARTMENT - DAY
Jasleen reaches opens the cabinet under the sink, takes out a
box of sanitary napkins she brought from India with Punjabi
writing all over it.
The box is empty. Her brow tightens with dismay.

INT. DUANE READE PHARMACY - LATER - DAY
Jasleen wanders the long aisles of the drugstore, trying to
compare the pictures on her box to those on the shelves. A
MALE EMPLOYEE makes no attempt to help, looking at her Sikh
clothes and veil with contempt.
She rounds the corner, approaches a FEMALE EMPLOYEE and shows
her the box.
JASLEEN
Where is...?
EMPLOYEE
I can't read that.
A hand snatches the box away. It's another Sikh woman (MATA,
40ish).
MATA
You see the picture! You know what
she wants!
No ma'am.

EMPLOYEE

MATA
You work here and you don't know
where is the sanitary napkin!
Mata's raised voice gets the attention of the MANAGER, who
looks over.
EMPLOYEE
Aisle five.
Mata grabs Jasleen's hand, pulling her toward the right
aisle.
MATA
They're so rude here. You have to
demand your respect in America!
Where are you from?
Dadiala.

JASLEEN

MATA
My uncle lives there! Why don't I
see you at gurdwara, darling?

Darwan pulls up in his taxi. He goes to his front door, then
hesitates, surprised to hear WOMEN CHATTERING within.
114

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - MAGIC HOUR
Darwan enters to find five SIKH WOMEN occupying the couches,
all YAKKING with Jasleen. He recognizes one.
DARWAN
Mata! Hello.
MATA
(re: Jasleen)
Darwan Singh! Why do you shut up
this pearl in the house?
DARWAN
(on the spot; smiles)
I assure you she's free to go
anywhere.
MATA
(to Jasleen)
What a husband! Leaving you alone
all the time. Don't worry, darling,
we make our own fun here, we don't
need him.
Jasleen casts an anxious look at Darwan, gets up to go to the
kitchen.
JASLEEN
I make dinner.
DARWAN
Never mind. Enjoy your new friends.
(goes to door)
I'll pick up something to eat.
SIKH WOMAN
(calls after him)
That's right, leave her to us. You
won't recognize her when we're done
with her!
The women HOOT with laughter. Jasleen grins.

PANNING OVER PACKING CARTONS - their flaps open, revealing
hundreds of BOOKS waiting to be put on shelves.
ANOTHER ANGLE - TASHA helps Wendy unpack in her new, bare
apartment. The dark, hermetic burrow of her old townhouse has
been replaced by open space and tall windows.
TASHA
Whew! There's so much...stuff.
WENDY
Believe me, I threw out tons.
Wendy puts her arm around her daughter.
WENDY (cont’d)
Bless you for helping. But hadn't
you better get on the road? It's a
long drive.
TASHA
Mom...I think I won't go back.
(off Wendy's surprise)
I love farming but...mainly I
wanted to be close to this guy, and
then he suddenly decided to go back
to Dartmouth, and so now I'm alone
and all the other kids are gone...
WENDY
So - what? You want to go back to
school, too? Isn't it too late for
the semester?
TASHA
Yeah...Maybe I won't go back at
all.
Tasha's voice catches; tears in her eyes; swallows a sob.
TASHA (cont’d)
I'm just so embarrassed...
WENDY
(embraces her)
Baby...
TASHA
Can I stay here with you?

Tasha. No. And not because I
wouldn't love it. But if you move
in here it will be in a spirit of
failure. And that is deadly. Finish
this thing out. Go back to Vermont
and harvest your ass off. Make it a
triumph.
Tasha nods, sniffing back tears.
TASHA
Back to the earth.
WENDY
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.

TASHA

She hugs her mother again, not wanting to let go.
WENDY
I'll visit you. I promise.
TASHA
But it's so far.
WENDY
I will find a way.

I/E MOVING STUDENT CAR - DAY

117

Wendy drives through Brooklyn with Darwan by her side. Their
conversation in the following sequence is punctuated by long,
easy silences: they are as comfortable together as an old
married couple.
WENDY
How is Jasleen?
DARWAN
She's very busy. She goes to school
now, taking classes...
They drive around Fort Tryon Park where the leaves are
changing in the amber September sun...
WENDY (O.S.)
Who do you think will win the World
Series?
DARWAN (O.S.)
Well, Indians don't know baseball.
Cricket's our game.
Passing through Grand Army Plaza, with its bronze Civil War
statue of General Sherman...
DARWAN (cont'd)
How do you like your new apartment?
WENDY
It's an adjustment. I'm tasting it.
They exchange smiles.
LATER - Passing through Carroll Gardens, with its affluent
homes guarded by elaborate wrought-iron gates...
...Williamsburg waterfront, with its decaying artistinhabited buildings and water taxis...
WENDY (cont'd)
You're so quiet.
DARWAN
You're not doing anything wrong.

He buys coffee from a STREET VENDOR.
Suddenly he sees the student car returning with Wendy at the
wheel. The TEST EXAMINER (#2) is in the passenger seat beside
her.
Abandoning the coffee and his money with the Vendor, Darwan
breaks into a run...
WIDE ANGLE - Examiner #2 emerges from the passenger side,
striding away with her clipboard. As Darwan reaches the car,
Wendy jumps from the car and flings her arms around him with
a little SHRIEK of victory.
119

I/E MOVING STUDENT CAR #2 - LATER - DAY

Darwan drives through Brooklyn, taking Wendy back to
Manhattan. She's on her cell phone to Tasha.
WENDY
(into phone)
Sweetie, I got it!...Yes!...I
wasn't as nervous this time...Soon,
I hope. When are the leaves turning
up there? I've always wanted to see
that!...
As her CONVERSATION FADES we PAN TO DARWAN'S FACE:
conflicted, as their relationship draws to a close.
Suddenly Wendy pokes his arm, breaking his trance.
Park here!

WENDY (cont'd)

She's pointing gaily to a CAR DEALERSHIP.
120

EXT. PARKING LOT, CAR DEALERSHIP - LATER - DAY

120

A SALESMAN stands with Darwan and Wendy looking at a RED
COMPACT car.
WENDY
It's a good price.
SALESMAN
You can drive it off the lot today,
if the color's okay with you.
WENDY
I never thought of red, but...?

Red is happy. It's what the bride

WENDY
But what does it say about me? I'm
a hot little number? Hussy on
board?
It says...

DARWAN

He leans in and whispers:
DARWAN (cont'd)
"Don't fuck with me."
They both break up GIGGLING, their heads together. The
Salesman eyes them, thinking they are certainly the oddest
couple he's seen in a while.
121

INT. SALESMAN'S CUBICLE - LATER - DAY
The Salesman prepares the paperwork at his desk. Darwan and
Wendy sit opposite.
SALESMAN
So, who is purchasing the vehicle,
you or your wife?
DARWAN
(taken aback)
She's -- she's not my wife.
SALESMAN
But whose name will the car be
under, sir?
DARWAN
Really, we are not together.
WENDY
(teasing)
Honey, it's okay.
(to Salesman)
I'm buying it.

EXT. PARKING LOT, CAR DEALERSHIP - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON
The salesman leads them back to the little red car and
ceremoniously hands Wendy her new car keys. Darwan CLAPS in
applause. Wendy beams. It's like a birthday.
The Salesman returns inside. Wendy opens her car door.
WENDY
Wait. How do I get home?
DARWAN
You can follow me to the bridge.
She still doesn't get in. They're both reluctant, now that
this moment is here.
WENDY
Darwan...Thank you.
(smiles)
I'll be hearing your voice in my
head for a long time.
DARWAN
That would please me.
WENDY
Well...Here goes!
She turns to climb inside her new car. His formality
crumbles; he holds her back; words rush from him heedlessly;
he knows he's begging but can't stop himself:
DARWAN
Wendy -- could we go somewhere? We
can celebrate, have dinner -please -She's already shaking her head.
DARWAN (cont'd)
Or have coffee some time, just to
chat -I can't.

WENDY

It costs her to refuse him, and her eyes show her regret.
DARWAN
I want to see you again.

She quickly wraps her arms around his neck, hugging him
close. His heart opens wide and he presses himself to her.
Then she pulls away.
WENDY (cont'd)
The trouble is...
What? Why?

DARWAN

She leans in and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek. Then:
WENDY
...You're a good man.
(smiles)
You're my faith.
He looks on forlornly as she gets into her new car, puts the
key in the ignition.
Wendy.

DARWAN

She looks up.

He realizes it's Jasleen. Her eyes are downcast in prayer,
her lips moving. He is struck by the simple, heartfelt
devotion in her face. An image out of the old country.
He retreats so she won't see him.
126

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHTFALL
Jasleen enters, her arms of with school books and grocery
bags. She stops short, seeing Darwan seated on the bed.
He's very still, just looking at her.
JASLEEN
(much improved English)
Darwan, I didn't expect you.
Something in his manner makes her put down her bags and sit
quickly beside him.
DARWAN
Jasleen...Maybe I will not work at
night anymore. Would you like that?
Oh, yes!

JASLEEN

A beat. He drops his eyes, feeling his awkwardness, his
stubborn formality. He must gather his courage to "cross the
divide," as Wendy would say.
Darwan?

JASLEEN (cont'd)

He looks up.
JASLEEN (cont'd)
If you have more time now...
can you teach me to drive?
He lights up. Gazing at her with a warmth and a need she
hasn't see before, he stretches his hand to her face.
Yes.

His fingers touch her cheek tenderly, as if she was treasure.
Her dark eyes shine, and she leans her face gratefully into
his palm...

Wendy drives slowly, with growing confidence, through the New

HER EYES flicker up, down, side to side, using the mirrors,
reading the signs, seeing the whole picture.
FANTASY: Magically, more travellers materialize all around as
if accompanying and escorting her into the traffic flow: a
TAXI, a VAN, a TEENAGER ON A SCOOTER, a PEDI-CAB, a
MOTORCYCLIST, a PUSHCART VENDOR, a BICYCLE MESSENGER, a
mighty river of travellers; all carried, like her, into the
uncharted horizon...
And as far as she can see ahead, all the TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE
GREEN.

Go on, Wendy. You have the light.
WENDY takes a DEEP BREATH.
