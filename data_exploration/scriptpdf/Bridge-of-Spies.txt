TITLE OVER BLACK:

1.

1957.

The height of the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet
Union fear each other’s nuclear capabilities - and
intentions. Both sides deploy spies - and hunt for them.
INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS
CLOSE ON AN ELDERLY MAN
Reflected in a grimy mirror. The mirror is propped up on a
chair next to an open window looking out from the fourth
floor onto a Brooklyn skyline.
Pull back to show the man sitting in a shabby
workshop/studio. He looks from the mirror down at a canvas
in front of him as he daubs paint onto a self-portrait.
The telephone rings.
The old man rests his brush on the easel and walks to a table
cluttered with papers and shortwave radios. He picks up the
phone and listens but doesn’t say anything.
FULTON STREET
The old man, Rudolf Abel, emerges from the building, walks
along the street.
TITLE: BROOKLYN
An Agent follows Abel.
SUBWAY TRAIN INTERIOR
The Agent watches Abel as the train stops at Broad Street.
The Agent, now joined by a second Agent, follows him at a
distance. Abel dabs at his nose with a handkerchief. The
agents lose him in the crush of commuters. They emerge from
the station and consult two other Agents. No sign of Abel.
First Agent heads back down the stair, smashing BANG right
into Abel, who’s coming up the stairs.
Abel looks up, surprised.
Excuse me.

Then mildly:

ABEL

The agent equally surprised watches as Abel makes his way
around him.

Abel sets down his palette.
Close on his hand, adjusting his easel, then feeling under
the bench. His hand closes on something held by a magnet to
the bench’s steel frame below the wood seat-slats: it is a
nickel.

INSIDE THE ROOM
As Abel lets himself in. A very modest room. He sets down
his portable easel and case. Sets his work-in-progress
canvass on a standing easel, drapes his jacket over a chair,
hangs his hat on the easel. He turns on a table fan.
He fishes the nickel from his pocket, retrieves a razor from
the bathroom and uses it to carefully to open it. It is
hollow.
Inside is a piece of paper, folded accordion-style into a
small square.
Abel unfolds it. Holds it up to a magnifier lamp.

ABEL’S ROOM
Its door is being busted in.
The Agents swarm in.

They have guns.

They come up short.

The small room is empty. The easel with a work in progress
upon it stands before the window, which stands open, gentle
wind playing at the sheers.
Outside, a fire escape.

The man seems to have left.

An Agent inspects a closed door. The bathroom -- Rudolf
Abel steps out, in his briefs. Standing in the doorway,
cigarette in mouth, we see him as a frail, vulnerable old
man.
He freezes, not scared, just surprised.
They look at him.

He looks at the men.

At last he speaks, with colorless, quasi-British accent.
Visitors.

ABEL

A beat.
ABEL (CONT’D)
...Would you mind if I fetch my
teeth?
Two of the agents, Blasco and Gamber, look at each other,
confused. Abel gestures back towards the bathroom.
BLASCO
Colonel, would you turn around
please.
Blasco turns Abel around, checks to make sure he’s not armed.
Sit down.

BLASCO (CONT’D)
On the bed.

Blasco and Gamber walk him to the bed.

He sits.

ABEL
(gesturing toward
bathroom)
The teeth are on the sink...

GAMBER
Look at me! We are agents from the
federal government.
Abel scans the Agents who surround him.
GAMBER (CONT’D)
Look at me! I’m talking to you. We
have received information concerning
your involvement in espionage. You
can either cooperate with us right
now or you’ll be under arrest. Do
you understand, Colonel?
Blasco heads into the bathroom.
ABEL
Not really. Why do you keep calling
me “Colonel”?
Blasco returns and with care hands him his teeth. Abel puts
them in.
BLASCO
You need to get dressed.
GAMBER
We have to search your apartment.
Abel points at the art materials on the table.
ABEL
Would you mind if I cleaned my
palette? The paints will get ruined
otherwise. Just behind you there.
I have a cloth, myself...
Abel stands.

Blasco hands him his palette.

Thank you.

ABEL (CONT’D)

BLASCO
(to the other men)
Start searching, please.
ABEL
Would you put this out in the
ashtray. On the windowsill there.

While an Agent does this and the other Agents begin the
search, Abel, holding the palette, grabs a small scrap of
paper -- the one from the nickel bearing a series of
numerals.
As the agents explore the room, Abel uses the paper to wipe
the palette clean.

Don’t want this to get spoiled.
The wet paint obliterates the code.

DONOVAN
We’re talking about a guy who is
insured by my client. So don’t make
him “my guy.”
BATES
Okay, fine, my point is he -- the
guy insured by your client -- he
doesn’t deny any of these things
happened -DONOVAN
“These things?”
Yes.

These five things.

DONOVAN
Well -- I’m sorry -- it’s not clear

me.
BATES
It’s self-evident.
DONOVAN
Okay, then tell me what happened,
tell me the story in a way that
makes sense. For five things.
Fine.

BATES
Absolutely.

Your guy --

DONOVAN
Not my guy. Insured by my client.
BATES
The guy insured by your client -- is
driving down State Highway 19 when
he loses control of his car, hits my
five guys. The five guys who hired
me to represent them because you’re
not honoring your claim.
DONOVAN
You mean my client is not honoring
the claim. The insurance company.
BATES
Mr. Donovan: we’re all clear on
who’s who here.
DONOVAN
Except, my client honors every
claim. They do, Mr. Bates, every
single legitimate claim. Up to the
limit of their liability, which is
$100,000 per accident in the case of
this man’s policy. And this is one
claim, according to your
description. “He hit my five guys.”
The guy insured by my client had one
accident, one one one, losing
control of the car and hitting five
motorcyclists.

Jim. If I go bowling and I throw a
strike, one thing happened. Ten

BATES
Jim. My clients are not bowling
pins. As much your guy might have
treated them so -DONOVAN
Lemme finish. If your house is
insured to $100,000 and a tornado
carries it away, it carried away one
house. It didn’t pick up every
stick of furniture and destroy it in
a separate incident. If that’s what
you’re saying, well, then there is
never any limit to our liability and
that is the end of the insurance
business. And then, Bob, nobody is
safe.

Donovan sets his briefcase, mail and hat down and follows

WATTERS
The accused doesn’t know any
lawyers. The Federal Court tossed
it into our lap. The Bar Committee
took a vote. You were the unanimous
choice.
GOODNOUGH
It was important to us -- it’s
important to our country, Jim -that this man is seen as getting a
fair shake. American justice will
be on trial.
DONOVAN
Well, of course, when you put it
that way, it’s an honor to be asked.
But -- Lynn -- I’m an insurance
lawyer, I haven’t done criminal work
in years.

situation. The man is publicly
reviled.
DONOVAN
And I will be too.
GOODNOUGH
Yes, in more ignorant quarters. But
that’s exactly why this has to be
done -- and capably done. It can’t
look like our justice system tosses
people on the ash heap.

Suppose I did...what’s the evidence

Pretty overwhelming.

Great. Great. Everyone will hate me,

Watters) What do you think, Tom?
The firm’ll suffer, I have work
here.
WATTERS
I think it’s a patriotic duty, this
is an important mission. I told
Lynn the firm can’t say no, and
you’d have a tough time saying no
too. I think you have to defend the
sonofabitch.

DONOVAN
The Rosenbergs were traitors -ROGER
Who are they?
DONOVAN
They gave atomic secrets to the

Doug, deaf to the irony, is innocently enthusiastic:

Good morning, sir. My name is Jim
Donovan. These are my credentials -Both men stand looking at each other, Abel still at the

After a beat he moves in further, his gaze holding on Donovan
who glances at papers on table
DONOVAN (CONT’D)
I’m a partner at Watters, Cowan and
Donovan. I was admitted to the New
York Bar in 1941.
As the guard slams the door shut, Abel picks up the papers
and inspects them. Donovan watches him, trying to read him.
DONOVAN (CONT’D)
...You’ve been charged with three
counts and nineteen overt acts;
conspiracy to transmit United States
defense and atomic secrets to the
Soviet Union; conspiracy to gather
secrets; and failing to register as
a foreign agent.
ABEL
Do many foreign agents register?
Only now does Abel look up from the credentials up to
Donovan. Donovan takes a moment, not sure if he’s being
kidded. He takes a seat at the table.

Okay, drivers, here’s the deal. You

which you are not to discuss with
anyone outside of this room. No
one. I don’t care who you trust -wife, mother, sweetheart, the good
lord when you pray at night -- you
don’t tell any of ‘em anything of
what I’m about to tell you. Each of
you drivers has met certain
qualifications -- high level
security clearance, exceptional
pilot ratings, in excess of the
required hours flight time in a
single seat aircraft. We are
engaged in a war. This war does not
-- for the moment -- involve men at
arms. It involves information. You
will be collecting information. You
will be gathering intelligence about
the enemy -- the intelligence you
gather could give us the upper hand
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union. Or it could
prevent one. For public purposes -as far as your wife or mother or
sweetheart or the good lord above -your mission does not exist. If it
does not exist you do not exist.
You cannot be shot down. You cannot
be captured.

From this moment forward, you will
not refer to the U-2 as a spy plane
or reconnaissance aircraft. You
will refer to it as “the article.”
“The article” has an eighty-foot
wingspan. Powered by a single Pratt
and Whitney J57 P37 engine. 10,000
pounds of thrust. Maximum speed of
430 miles an hour. She may not be
quick but at your cruising altitude

an airburst and if the bomb is 50

This one time, when I was the age of
your son, our house was overrun -by partisan border guards. Dozens
of them. My father was beaten. My
mother was beaten. And this man, my
father’s friend -- he was beaten.
And I watched this man. Every time
they hit him, he stood back up
again. So they hit him harder.
Still, he got back to his feet. I

just a phrase, Your Honors. It’s

...He was treated as a combatant in

our government to so treat him.
Accordingly he was not given the

to a suspected enemy, was not
appropriate to a suspected criminal.

SUPREME COURT
DONOVAN
I know this man. If the charge is
true, he serves a foreign power -but he serves it faithfully. If he
is a soldier in the opposing army -he is a good soldier. He has not
fled the battle to save himself; he
has refused to serve his captor, he
refused to betray his cause, he has
refused to take the coward’s way
out. The coward must abandon his
dignity before he abandons the field
of battle. That, Rudolf Abel will
never do. Shouldn’t we, by giving
him the full benefit of the rights
that define our system of
governance, show this man who we
are? Who we are: is that not the
greatest weapon we have in this Cold
War? Will we stand by our cause
less resolutely than he stands by
his?

Powers looks down, his legs trapped under his instrument
panel. He tries to wriggle free as the U-2 drops at two
hundred feet a second.
As the plane continues to fall, the earth rushing into view,
Powers opens the DESTRUCT button and the canopy shatters,
sucking him out of the cockpit. Powers’ faceplate freezes
instantly in the sub-zero air. He falls alongside the U-2 as
it spirals downward and cracks apart, tied to the cockpit by
his oxygen tube.
The plane’s instrument panel begins to freeze over. The
DESTRUCT button remains open but unpressed. Power’s oxygen
pipe, secured to a tank in the cockpit, begins to rip loose.
Using the oxygen pipe Powers hauls himself back towards the
aircraft. He reaches for the DESTRUCT button but cannot
quite reach it.
The pipe shears away from its tank and Powers separates from
the plane.
Man and plane continue to fall alongside one another. Then,
at 15,000 feet, Powers’ parachute automatically opens.
A piece of the fuselage barely misses him as he pulls off his
frozen face plate. He drifts down, the landmass of Russia
rising toward him.
Powers rips off his faceplate, sucks in air. Far below now,
the shattered tail of the U-2 shears off. Both wings are

Allen Dulles (70’s) hands Donovan a cup of coffee.
DULLES
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.
Thank you.

DONOVAN

Dulles lifts the letter from a sideboard.
DULLES
Okay. This letter you received. It
seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.
They’re doing it through East
Germany because they still don’t
want to acknowledge Abel is a Soviet
citizen much less a Soviet spy. So,
a lot of fiction going on.
Yes sir.

DONOVAN
But -- to what end?

DULLES
They’ve got our guy, our spy pilot,
we’ve got their guy.
He hands the letter to agent Hoffman.
DULLES (CONT’D)

Well congratulations. Red-letter

there, Powers -- a good man -- but
with a...with a head full of
classified information. Abel has a
head full of classified information,
too, but he hasn’t given us a lick.
DONOVAN
And, sir, take it from me -- he
won’t.
DULLES
Yes, we know that but the Russians
don’t. They want their man back
before he cracks and we want Powers
back for the same reasons.
DONOVAN
I think you’re saying, sir, there
might be a happy ending for
everybody -DULLES
Yes, if we, um, indulge their
fiction.
He lights a pipe, studies Donovan.
DULLES (CONT’D)
We want you to negotiate the swap
because you’re a private citizen, so
it’s not governments talking. They
don’t acknowledge Abel as a Soviet

East Germany as a sovereign country.

Correct. Which means of course you
can’t rely on any acknowledgment or

A door clicks open -- not the one Donovan entered by but one
set into a panel of the wall near the mirror behind the desk.
A man enters.
MAN
Mr. Donovan.
Donovan rises, extending a hand.
Mr. Vogel?

DONOVAN

Shaking hands, his manner dry, urbane:
SCHISCHKIN
No no, no. My name is Schischkin,
Ivan Schischkin. I am second
secretary of the Soviet Embassy. It
would not be appropriate for Mr.
Vogel to join us; he is a German
national.
DONOVAN
So you are...here to...
SCHISCHKIN
To facilitate this meeting. (to the
group on the couch) Perhaps Mrs.
Abel would like to compose herself
privately? And let Mr. Donovan and
myself to talk?
The group takes the cue and leaves by the main door, faces

SCHISCHKIN
Yes yes -- of course we should talk.
Please, have a seat. Sit down.
They sit opposite one another at a small table.
SCHISCHKIN (CONT’D)
So, how did you arrive in the
Eastern sector?
The train.

DONOVAN
The S-Bahn.

SCHISCHKIN
You were alone?
Yup.

DONOVAN

SCHISCHKIN
And you are credentialed -DONOVAN
You must know about me, sir. I’m a
private citizen, a lawyer in
Brooklyn -- in the United States -and I’ve taken some time out of a
busy schedule to help my client,
Rudolf Abel. I’m authorized to
arrange an exchange of Abel for
Francis Gary Powers -- this is a
full pardon of Abel (handing a paper
across) that will be signed when the
exchange actually takes place.
That’s the only reason I’m here. I
hope and expect to make this
arrangement quickly -- Abel for
Francis Gary Powers (a measured
beat) and -- Frederic Pryor.
SCHISCHKIN
We don’t have Pryor.
No?

DONOVAN
You don’t?

SCHISCHKIN
I’ve heard of Pryor. But he is held

by the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.
Schischkin hands him back the pardon.
DONOVAN
Well, I’ll tell you the first
problem, the names of your countries
are too long.
Schischkin smiles.
SCHISCHKIN
If we release Powers it is only to
promote good will between our
countries. So it cannot be an
exchange. Perhaps you could release
Abel as a token of good will to our
friends in Germany, and then some
months later we would release
Powers, there’s an idea.
DONOVAN
No, that won’t work for us at all,
you see we need this to be an
exchange. You can call it what you
want, but an exchange it must be. We
can have Abel within forty-eight
hours. We need Powers at the same
time we give you Abel.
SCHISCHKIN
Well this is -- can we call this
“The Impatient Plan”?
DONOVAN
Call it whatever you want.
Donovan’s cold’s getting worse.

He blows his nose.

SCHISCHKIN
I can relay your Impatient Plan to
Moscow, see what they say. But they
will wonder, why so Impatient?
DONOVAN
Because I have a cold, I don’t live
in Berlin, and I want to get home.

SCHISCHKIN
They will think, well, the Americans
must have gotten all the information
that Abel had to give. And now they
are now impatient to trade him,
hoping to get in return this man
Powers who perhaps has not yet given
up the information that he has to
give. This is not an equitable
trade, sir.
DONOVAN
But you’re saying, if Powers has
given up everything he knows, then
Moscow would trade? Why wouldn’t
they? As for Abel, if he dies in an
American prison, the next Russian
operative who gets caught might
think twice about keeping his mouth
shut...(and now he tries something
new) and, you never know, Abel might
want to see the sky again and start
to trade Russian secrets for very
small American favors.
SCHISCHKIN
How can we know this. We little
men, we just do our jobs.
DONOVAN
Like Lt. Powers. He’s just a pilot.
SCHISCHKIN
He was making photographs from
seventy thousand feet when he was
shot from the sky. People in my
country consider this an act of war.

We have to get off this merry go

countries make could be the last
one. We need to have the
conversation our governments can’t.
Schischkin takes a moment to think.

Pryor. At the same time.
VOGEL
Absolutely.
Vogel takes a photograph from a file on his desk top. The
photo is of an incarcerated Pryor, looking very young and
very scared. He hands it to Donovan.

Hoffman strides toward Donovan, who is wrapped in a blanket

Good. Good. So -- who is this
Vogel?
HOFFMAN
Him we don’t know. He might be what
you said he is, friend of the
Attorney General. Just some guy the
GDR tapped to handle this. Sounds
like the East Germans are fighting
for a place at our table. The GDR
gets Abel back for the Russians,
winning their respect, and captures
the headlines for their cause.
Which of course puts East Germany on
the map. But we don’t care about
their map. Stick with the Russians.
Stick with the Russians. It’s
Powers for Abel.
DONOVAN
So, does all this mean it might
actually -- happen?
HOFFMAN
That’s what you seem to be telling
me. We’ll put Abel on a plane,
he’ll be here Friday. So if
Schischkin gets the okay, all that’s
left is the mechanics of the trade,
how we swap our guy for their guy.

DONOVAN
What message?
HOFFMAN
From from the East Germans. They
called the number I gave you, said
they wanted to speak to you today.
DONOVAN
Vogel called?
HOFFMAN
No. Office of Harald Ott.
German attorney general.

East

DONOVAN
Wanting what -- what does he want?
HOFFMAN
To talk to you, but -- it’s okay, I
can’t ask you to go back there.
Listen, you seem to be persona non
grata to some elements. We won’t
push our luck.
DONOVAN
So he wants to see me.

What time?

HOFFMAN
No no no, now listen, you don’t need
to go -- in fact, you shouldn’t go.
In fact you can’t go. We’re set
with the Soviets, we don’t want to
screw it up.
DONOVAN
(rising)
I’m not going to screw it up.
HOFFMAN
You’re not going, don’t be a pain in
the ass.
DONOVAN
Oh, I ordered. Enjoy your big
American breakfast.
He leaves. Several waitresses deposit mountains of food
before an abashed Hoffman.

CONFERENCE ROOM
Architecturally grand in a beaux-art manner but cracked and
peeling. Furnishings sparse and poor.
A heavy middle-aged man shakes Donovan’s hand. A male
secretary to one side sits taking notes as the Ott and
Donovan take their seats at Ott’s desk..
OTT
I thought it should be negotiated at
the highest level. As a courtesy to
you.
DONOVAN
Well I thank you sir.
OTT
I don’t know how things became so
confused.
DONOVAN
Well... I guess sometimes they just
do.
Female servers clear a large conference table of dishes.
OTT
For sake of clarity, I say we are
fully prepared to exchange the socalled student Pryor for Rudolf
Abel. I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.
Yes sir.

DONOVAN
But --

OTT
We will do a memorandum to that
effect.
DONOVAN
A memorandum.
OTT
(generous)
Certainly. We commit to a bilateral
exchange -DONOVAN
Yes, sure, I’m not sure what you
mean, but -- my country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

reasons? What’s done is done, he

HALLWAY
Big echoing public space. Donovan is seated on a hard bench.
Bicycle messengers whiz by in both directions.
The secretary’s footsteps echo as he crosses to Donovan.

I am very sorry sir. The Attorney
General regrets that he had to leave
on urgent business.

No, no, the thing is, I have this
cold, I want to get back home, get

Can you give the message?
Certainly.

SECRETARY

DONOVAN
This is the message. There is no
deal for Abel unless we get Powers

It is arranged for tomorrow morning.
It will not happen unless we get two

DONOVAN
If there is no deal, your boss must
tell the Soviets. He has to tell
the Soviets that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.
Yes sir.

SECRETARY

Donovan rises.
DONOVAN
And tell him this: so far Abel has
been a good soldier. But he thinks
he’s going home. If we have to tell
him he’s not going home, the Soviets
don’t want him, that he’s never
going home -- I imagine his behavior
might change. And who will be held
responsible for that. (He chuckles)
That’s a long message! Ya got it
all?
Yes sir.

SECRETARY
Got it!

DONOVAN
Good. You’re a good man. (steps
away; turns back with one last
thought) Oh -- and also tell him, no
deal unless they let us know by the
end of business today. He has the
number. If the exchange isn’t gonna
happen, no reason for everyone to
get up first thing in the morning.
No sir.

SECRETARY
That would be pointless.

That’s exactly what you weren’t
supposed to do.
DONOVAN
My instructions were to feel out the
situation.
HOFFMAN

Your instructions were to get
Powers! Not Pryor!! That was not
the original deal! You fouled it

DONOVAN
How do you know? I feel pretty good
about it.
Hoffman hands him the change, almost too angry to speak -HOFFMAN
You fucked it all up!
DONOVAN
Oh don’t worry, I think it’ll be
fine.
Donovan reaches a phone booth, enters.
HOFFMAN
How do you know?! You don’t know
that!
Hoffman is still staring at him, anger fading as he digests
the implications. He looks around at where they are and how
public it is. Donovan drops in the coins, in broken German
places a long distance call to New York.
DONOVAN
(to Hoffman)
Look, the whole thing was just to
feel me out, will I swap one-forone. And which one. So I said No,
two-for one, so they know where we
stand, so it’ll be fine.

Hoffman as he shuts the
door on him)
I’m in London. Just for one more
meeting, then I’m on my way home.
Yeah, yeah I remember that
marmalade. It’s that shop right by
Regents Park. All right, I will if
I have the time. Hey, could I say
hi to Roger? Can I say hello to the
girls? Is anyone not busy?
Have they even noticed I’m not
around?
SAFE HOUSE
Hoffman is sitting quietly, waiting. So is Donovan. They
are freezing -- breath visible in the indoor air, and now
Hoffman has a cold. A telephone sits in the center of the
room on a small table, under a ratty lamp.
The the phone rings! Both go for it, as do Michener and
Pinker, entering from another room. Hoffman picks it up.
Donovan turns and watches Hoffman’s face. Hoffman looks at
Donovan. Donovan looks at Hoffman. Both unreadable.
Slowly, Hoffman hangs up the phone. Unreadable. Finally
Hoffman cracks the smallest smile.
We’re on.

HOFFMAN
Two for one.

Hot dog!

release him at the same time -- when
the Russians give us Powers on the
bridge, they’ll release Pryor over
at Checkpoint Charlie.

I think it means, “We wanna have the
last word.”

TITLE:

THE GLIENICKE BRIDGE

The snow-covered Glienicke Bridge. Mid-February: it’s just
before dawn. Morning fog. Gray-blue light.
Hoffman and Donovan are at the foot of the bridge, looking
east.
The other side: some guard presence, but no officialdom, no
prisoner.
Some pacing from Donovan.
DONOVAN
Where’s our guy? Where’s their guy - they’re late.
HOFFMAN

Nobody’s late. We’re early.

Because we have snipers.
Hoffman swings to the buildings on our side of the bridge,
revealing our snipers. For the first time Donovan feels the
extent to which he is out of his depth, not in control.
Engine noise nearby: two cars approaching, from our side.
They pull up. Avalon emerges, walks to opposite side
passenger door and opens it.
AVALON
Step out, sir.
Rudolf Abel steps out, takes in the environment, sees Donovan
on the bridge, waiting for him. His clothes are too big on
him as Donovan’s coat is too big on Donovan. Abel, carrying
his suitcase, walks to Jim, hand extended.
Dear Jim.

ABEL
How are you.

Donovan clasps his hand, shakes it.
DONOVAN
Happy to see you.
ABEL
Have you arranged all this for me?

TRAIN
Subway, the next day. Donovan riding into work. He sits by
the window as he did on the S-Bahn but now, finally, looks
like he’s had a good night’s sleep.
Passengers on the train are reading their newspapers,
headlines about the spy exchange. One woman - the same woman
who once looked at him disapprovingly - looks below the fold
and sees a photo of Donovan. Recognizes him sitting across
from her. She smiles. He is uncomfortable, but then he
smiles too. His look drifts to his window.
His point-of-view: Brooklyn sweeping by. More benign than
was Berlin. His peaceful expression darkens as the train
passes backyards where a group of kinds are climbing a fence,
dropping to the other side... The camera holds on the train
interior, Donovan continuing to gaze out the window...
TITLES:
Following his return to Russia, Rudolf Abel was reunited with
his wife and daughter. He was never publicly acknowledged by
the Soviet Union as a spy.
Gary Powers died in a helicopter crash in 1977, while working
for KNBC News. He was posthumously awarded the CIA
Director’s Medal and the USAF POW Medal in 2000 and the
Silver Star in 2012.
In 1962, Frederic L. Pryor received his Ph.D. in Economics
from Yale University. He is currently professor Emeritus of
Economics and Senior Research Scholar at Swarthmore College.
Following the successful conclusion of the Powers-Abel
exchange, Donovan was asked by President Kennedy to undertake
further negotiations on behalf of the US. In the summer of
1962 he was sent to Cuba to discuss with Fidel Castro terms
to obtain the release of 1,113 prisoners held after the Bay
of Pigs invasion.
When Donovan finished negotiations, he had secured the
release of 9,703 men, women and children.
