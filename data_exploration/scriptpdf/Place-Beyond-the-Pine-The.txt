INT/EXT. ALTAMONT FAIR - NIGHT

1

LUKE GLANTON; 28, handsome; is in his trailer. Deep breath.
He obsessively works with a butterfly knife in front of his
mirror, before sticking it into a table. His OCD. He zips up
a motorcycle jacket over faded prison tatoos, strides from
his trailer into the crowded fairgrounds - rides, people,
lights. He makes his way into a crowded tent.
2

INT. ALTAMONT FAIR MAIN RING- CONTINUOUS

2

Luke climbs onto his bike, revs the engine. Roadies slap his
back, give him high 5's. He is joined by 2 motorcyclists.
ANNOUCER OVER P.A.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, get ready to be rocked
by the motorcycle mayhem of...
A spherical, metal cage sits under the Big-Top.
ANNOUCER OVER P.A. (CONT’D)
Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs!
The two motorcycles ride ahead of Luke into the cage. Luke
bursts through, stops, revs his engine.
Luke drives into the cage where the other riders make long,
lazy loops. Luke guns it, guides his bike over the inside
walls of the cage. He defies gravity while weaving his way
around the other two stunt riders. He makes it look easy. But
it isn't. It is a death-defying act of bravado.
The other two drivers leave the cage and Luke performs his
finale; a slow inside loop where his bike leaps from one
facet of the cage to another. The crowd goes wild.
ANNOUCER OVER P.A. (CONT’D)
Let's hear it for Luke Glanton and
his Rough Riders, folks!

LATER

3

Lights are up. Luke sits on his bike, signing autographs and
taking pictures with a gaggle of extremely psyched 8-year old
boys. ROMINA GUTIERRES, 26, Hispanic walks against the surge
of people exiting the arena. Luke catches sight of her; he
drops what he's doing.
Hey!

LUKE

ROMINA
(shifting, awkward)
I didn't know if you'd remember...
Luke looks at her like she's crazy. His fans tug on his
clothing, vying for his attention.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 2.
He pushes through them to get closer to Romina. They give
each other a little hug, careful not to smush the youngsters
all around them.
LUKE
You wanna go somewhere? You got
plans tonight?
ROMINA
(shrugs)
I gotta go. I just wanted to see
you again.
LUKE
Can I give you a ride home?
She remembers the thrill riding on the back of Luke's bike.
ROMINA
I'm fine. I can just take the bus.
4

EXT. ROUTE 5 - NIGHT

4

Luke tears away from the Arena. Everything around looks rundown, abandoned. We are in Schenectady. It is 1994.
Romina rides on the back of his bike, her arms holding tight
around his abdomen. The wind blows hair into her indecisive
face. She really should be on the bus right now. But the air
is cold and Luke's body is warm. She buries her face into the
back of his leather jacket.
5

EXT. TWO-FAMILY HOUSE - LATER
Luke pulls up in front of an old, two-family house. Romina
gets off, looks over her shoulder; the living room light is
ON. She says, "thanks" and gives Luke a peck on the cheek.
LUKE
That's it? You don't wanna talk, or
anything...
ROMINA
(hiding something)
I can't. I think about you a lot.
LUKE
So then let’s hang. We pack up
after tomorrow night's show and I
probably won't be back this way for
another year. At least. Wanna get a
beer or something?
ROMINA
(comes close, whispers)
I'm with someone... I just wanted
to see you again...

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 3.
She kisses him again quick, wishing she could stay. Then runs
away, not looking back, up the steps of her childhood home.
LUKE
Say 'hi' to your mom.
Luke starts his bike, tears out of the neighborhood, tires
squealing smoke, blackening the street.
6

EXT. ALTAMONT FAIR. NIGHT.

6

Engine gunning, Luke circles the inside of the steel cage in
a rage. He is on the verge of crashing. The audience rapt.
7

LATER

7

ROADIES and performers pack up the steel cage. Luke wanders
through the activity and ignores the throngs of kids seeking
autographs. He searches the fair for Romina. She is nowhere
to be found. He mounts his bike.
8

EXT. ROUTE 5 - NIGHT

8

Raging, Luke drives fast through the night streets.
9

EXT./INT. TWO FAMILY HOUSE - LATER.

9

MALENA, 47, Guatemalan, opens the door in nurse's scrubs.
Instantly, she recognizes Luke.
LUKE
Hello mama.
MALENA
She's no here.
LUKE
(sighs, resigned)
Is the man of the house home?
Luke hears a BABY crying from inside. Malena tries to hide it
by closing the door so only her head is visible.
MALENA
Nobody's home...
Malena is short. And Luke peeks over her into the house. SEES
- a few baby toys scattered in the floor. Luke looks down.
Malena relents. She can't keep him away from the truth any
longer.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 4.
10

INT. TWO- FAMILY HOUSE- CONTINUOUS

10

He gets past her. Looks around the house. Follows the sound
of the crying baby upstairs. He pushes open the door to
Romina’s bedroom.
A BABY wails in the center of a twin bed surrounded by
pillows. Malena comes in, scoops him up, starts to bounce and
"shush" him. Luke stands near the door, rocked.
MALENA
You wanna hold him?
Luke is unsure. He awkwardly, but gently accepts the baby
into his arms. Luke and the baby stare at one another. Tears
well in Luke's eyes as he falls in love with his son. Malena
smiles.
LUKE
Romina still work at the diner?
Malena tries to give nothing away.
11

INT. OLYMPIC DINER - LATER

11

Luke walks into the diner. He’s pissed, looks around but
doesn’t see Romina.
Luke doesn’t sit. He waits. Romina exits kitchen with a tray
of food. Sees Luke immediately.
ROMINA
What are you doing here?
LUKE
Oh, I don’t know... You think we
have anything else to discuss
before I take off again tomorrow
forever?
Romina is frozen for a second. She knows that Luke knows her
secret. She walks to a table with her tray of food. Luke
stands still. Waits for her to come back.
When she returns, she is flustered. She walks him OUTSIDE.
LUKE (CONT’D)
You weren't gonna tell me?
ROMINA
It was just a fling.
LUKE
Still... It's common courtesy.
Might even be the law.
ROMINA
I haven't heard from you in a year.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 5.
LUKE
I know it. It's not 'cause I
haven't thought about you...
ROMINA
I haven't been waiting to hear from
you, or anything.
LUKE
What's his name?
Jason.

ROMINA

Luke and Romina look at each other in silence.
ROMINA (CONT’D)
I'm going to school nights now.
LUKE
(quickly)
Good for you.
ROMINA
I don't have a lot of time for
anything except Jason and school
and work. And my boyfriend.
LUKE
Sounds like you got everything you
need.
Luke turns and walks away from Romina. She is crushed as she
watches him walk away. She gets back to work.
12

EXT. ALTAMONT FAIR. TRAILER OFFICE.

12

The fair is packed up and ready to leave. Luke wheels his
bike up to a trailer office.
13

INT. ALTAMONT FAIR. TRAILER OFFICE-

13

JACK, weathered, 55, sips coffee and shoots Luke with venom
from his dilated pupils.
JACK
How many fuckin' times I have to
tell you? "After the show, help
everyone dismantle." Then you can
go get your dick wet and whatever
the fuck-else you need to do.
LUKE
When's this pay period end? Friday?
Why?

JACK

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 6.
LUKE
I need whatever's coming to me now.
You can cut off the next two days.
JACK
I don't give out advances.
LUKE
It's not an advance. I quit.
JACK
You can't quit.
LUKE
I'm taking the bike too.
JACK
You can't take the bike.
LUKE
It's my bike.
Jack sighs. He leans forward and pulls a wad of bills from
his back pocket. He peels off some bills.

EXT. KARL’S MOTEL - AFTERNOON

15

Luke's bike is parked in front of an old, run-down motel.
16

INT. KARL’S MOTEL- CONTINUOUS

16

Luke sits on his bed, eats McDonald's. The TV is on playing a
news report from 1994. He counts his pay-out, folds it, slips
it in his boot.
17

EXT. TWO-FAMILY HOUSE - MORNING

17

Luke rings the doorbell. Door opens. Romina stands there,
wearing her Sunday best. She is speechless and stares at Luke
through the screen door.
LUKE
Wow. You look like a princess.
ROMINA
What are you still doing here?
LUKE
I’m here. I thought I would come
over and take you guys to the park.
Romina nervously looks back into the house.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 7.
ROMINA
This isn’t a good time.
Ready?

KOFI (O.S.)

Romina turns. Sees KOFI CANKAM - 28, black, wearing a suit,
come down the stairs carrying Jason in his arms.
ROMINA
(back to Luke)
We’re going to church.
Kofi opens the door. Steps out onto the porch. Faces Luke.
KOFI
I know who you are.
LUKE
Well you got me at a disadvantage.
Luke sees his son, Jason, dressed in a white baptismal gown.
He is less frightened of his own son now. In fact, he wants
to hold him. He gestures to Kofi.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Do you mind?
Kofi doesn’t want Luke to take Jason away from him.
ROMINA
It’s okay. Let him.
Kofi hesitates. Concedes that he really has no choice in this
matter. He hands Jason to Luke.
KOFI
Watch his neck.
Luke and the baby stare at one another.
LUKE
Whoa. He’s a prince.
Romina watches Luke and Jason, smiles. Tears well in her
eyes. Kofi sees it all happen.
KOFI
So, when do you leave town?
Luke doesn’t answer. Instead, he asks his own question.
LUKE (TO KOFI)
How long you lived here?
Kofi has had enough but is playing along.
KOFI
Couple months.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 8.
LUKE
Little cheaper than having your own
place, I suppose...
ROMINA
Kofi’s helping us buy this house.
LUKE
Wow. You move fast huh?
KOFI
I’m not moving at all actually.
LUKE
How much they want for a place like
this anyway?
KOFI
Bout forty-five thousand. Why? You
in the market?
Romina reaches in and takes Jason from Luke.
ROMINA
Okay we have to go. Or we’re gonna
be late.
Luke stands on the porch, watching his family pile into
Kofi’s car and pull away.
18

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH. JASON’S BAPTISM. DAY.

18

Kofi holds Jason at the altar. Romina and Malena and KOFI’s
FATHER stand next to him. A PRIEST pours holy water over
Jason’s head.
Luke walks into the church, finds a seat in the pews, and
watches, planning his next move.

EXT. PINE BARRENS - DAY

23

Outside of town, thousands of tall, thin pines stand cheek by
jowl. Luke speeds between them with reckless abandon.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 9.
He catches sight of an ATV through the pines, plotting a
parallel course, as if in unspoken friendly competition. Luke
blows Robin away.
24

EXT. PARKING AREA OFF THE ROAD NEAR PINE BARRENS - LATER

24

Luke comes to a clearing, overlooking the parking area
adjacent to the main road. SEES -ROBIN VAN DER HOOK, 42,
white, working hard to get his ATV onto the trailer behind
his pickup. Robin sees Luke watching him from his perch.
Robin finishes loading and gets in his cab, fires up the
engine. He drives in a big circle, comes back to just
underneath Luke. Leans out his window.
ROBIN
Can I give you a lift?
Luke thinks about it.
A25

INT. ROBIN’S TRUCK. CONTINUOUS.

A25

Robin drives, eyeing Luke, admiring Luke’s physicality. He
introduces himself to Luke. Luke obliges.
ROBIN
It has been a long time since I’ve
seen anyone ride like that.
(beat)
You’d think you could make that
work for ya...
LUKE
You’d think...
25

EXT. KARL’S MOTEL - LATER
Robin pulls up to the motel, surveys the run-down motel.
LUKE
Thank you kindly.
ROBIN
You're staying here?
LUKE
Temporarily.
ROBIN
Just passing through, huh?
LUKE
Naw. I'm transitionin' in.
ROBIN
What are you doing for work?

25

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 10.
Luke looks around... not many opportunities in his sights.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
You know your way around an engine?
I do.

LUKE

ROBIN
I run a little service station back
down Washout road. I could use a
good, you know, American worker
like you, you know what I mean?
Good people. At least, that's what
you seem like.
Luke considers the offer. Robin flashes a wry smile.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Did I catch you at a busy time or
something?
26

EXT. VAN DER HOOK'S STATION - LATER

26

They pull up to into a run-down service station. Busted cars
crowd the bays. A JUNKYARD DOG named TULA barks at Luke.
Robin gets out. Show’s Luke around his little piece of
paradise. Luke looks around.
ROBIN
This is it. I can’t promise you a
lot of hours but you can keep
looking for other gigs in the mean
time.
LUKE
Sounds like fucking poverty.
Robin thinks on it. In the distance, an old trailer parked
under forest canopy.
ROBIN
I could offer you a place to
stay...
27

INT. TRAILER BEHIND SERVICE- CONTINUOUS

27

Robin opens the door to a trailer. A tiny fridge sits next to
a tiny stove, next to a twin bed.
ROBIN
It ain’t much but probably beats
that shit-hole you’ve been staying
at.
Luke looks around.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 11.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Anyway if this is helpful to you
you’re welcome to it.
LUKE
I’m not sucking your cock.
Robin laughs, awkward.
ROBIN
Okay.
(beat)
Have you been locked up?
Luke has. But he's not about to tell Robin about it.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
You don't have to be coy with me,
son. See this?
Robin points to his teeth.
ROBIN (CONT'D)
I had too many postage stamps.
Contraband, they said. They tell me
they’re gonna put me in solitary
for a month. Problem is, I had this
gum infection. Doc ordered 2 weeks
of antibiotics before they would
put me in solitary. But the
warden... he saw no need for
postponement. So he orders the
prison dentist to pull all my top
teeth. Then put me in solitary.
Damn near starved to death. Mom
smuggled in crushed penicillin
pills.
Robin punctuates his story by clacking his teeth.
ROBIN (CONT'D)
Ten years in Attica. Ten years
probation. I'm clean as a whistle
now. You ever been in jail?
Yes, sir.

LUKE

ROBIN
I knew it when I first saw you.
Birds of a feather... Wanna flock?
Luke has a mind to knock Robin's block off. Robin starts
laughing at him, deep belly laughs.
28

EXT. ROAD - DUSK

28

Luke tears down a winding road. The low sun creates a long
shadow of him on his bike on the road in front of him.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 12.
29

EXT. TWO FAMILY HOUSE, NIGHT

29

Luke sits on the side of his bike. Across the street is
Romina’s house. The kitchen is brightly lit and Luke can hear
the sound of talking and laughter. From his bike he sees Kofi
lifting Jason over his head and talking to him.
A30

EXT. STATE STREET. NIGHT.

A30

Luke stops at a red light, red light in his face. Light turns
green. He doesn’t move. He is staring at the Trustco bank
across the street.

30

INT. ROBIN'S SERVICE STATION - DAY

30

Luke, covered in grease, works diligently under a 1988 Ford
Taurus. He notices Robin's feet approach. Slides out from
under. Robin peels a few bills and hands them down to Luke.
ROBIN
Payday, my boy. Less room and
board.
Luke counts his paltry sum. Sighs.
31

EXT. ROBIN’S. PINE BARRENS - DAY
LATER. Luke and Robin sit an old tree stump drinking beer.
ROBIN
All my people were Dutch. This
town, the whole area started Dutch.
LUKE
I need to earn more money. Any
chance you give me a raise?
ROBIN
Believe me, kid. If I could give
anyone a raise, it would be you.
You're a real asset. And good
company too. The big chains bleed
me a little bit more each month.
The only regular work I get into
the shop is souping up low-riders
for niggers and spics.
LUKE
My kid is half spic. Or half
something south of the border...
Robin toasts Luke with his beer. They drink.
ROBIN
I like you. You remind me of me. A
lo-o-o-o-ong time ago.

31

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 13.
LUKE
You ain't so old.
ROBIN
Not so old I'm throwing in the
towel. I'm not just gonna sit there
and wait around til someone tell's
me I'm a dead duck. I have a
feeling you're the same way. Right?
LUKE
I don't like waiting around for
other people to give me permission
to live.
ROBIN
You're like me. You're a chisler.
LUKE
I ain't no chisler. What's that,
anyway?
ROBIN
You play all the angles... I know
you've been to jail. More than
once, right?
Luke puts down his beer and stares at Robin hard.
ROBIN (CONT'D)
Course you have. You've stolen
before.
Luke is quiet.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Oh, please do pardon me. I
certainly hope my misjudging you in
this way didn't hurt your feelings
too deeply. Tell me you've stolen!
LUKE
I've stolen.
ROBIN
But you did it stupid, right? You
got liquored up and knocked over a
convenience store or something?
LUKE
I didn't need to be liquored up.
ROBIN
Fair enough. But you got caught...
I know you like you're my own flesh
and blood. Your problem wasn't your
lack of courage. It was your lack
of foresight. Your plan failed you.
Look, how would you like to do it
right? With me? What do you say?

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 14.
LUKE
I got two things to say. First of
all, thank you, for considering me.
Second of all, fuck you. I got a
kid!
ROBIN
Well that's why we're talking here,
isn't it. I never had children,
that I know of, but I do watch a
lot of TV. Nature shows mostly.
Providing for your family, that's
something I understand. It's
animal. It's instinct. You get a
mouth to feed and all of a sudden
you got a purpose, you have a goal.
And you focus everything you have,
everything you are like a laser on
that goal, right? You gotta edge
out the competition with whatever
you have to offer. With whatever
talents are at your disposal. And
you're a man with some very, very
unique talents.
32

INT. OLYMPIC DINER - DARKEST HOUR BEFORE DAWN

32

The middle of a long shift. Romina steps from the kitchen
carrying several plates. She drops off the breakfast specials
at their destination and sees Luke - slumped in a booth.
Romina stares at the back of his head for a while.
MOMENTS LATER. They look at one another over cups of coffee.
Marry me.

LUKE

Romina tries to repress her laughter.
LUKE
Why are you laughing?
ROMINA
You're corny. You don't even know
me.
LUKE
I know I love my boy. He's
definitely my boy, right?
ROMINA
...Yeah... But you didn't even know
he existed until a few days ago.
LUKE
...Don't matter.
ROMINA
You say you want to marry me. You
don't mean it.
(MORE)

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 15.
ROMINA (CONT'D)
You might think you do. But it's
not true. You're just excited...
LUKE
How can you sit there, and tell me
what I do and don't feel? What’re
you, Carnac? I'm saying "I love
you." I'll learn to. Even when you
hurt my feelings. And I'm saying,
"I love him." That's it. There's
nothin' left to say. That's truth.
Romina soaks up his words.
LUKE (CONT’D)
I can take care of you.
ROMINA
Oh, really?
Yes.

LUKE

ROMINA
How are you gonna do that? You
don’t even have a job.
LUKE
That’s not true. I have a job now.
I’m making money. That’s not a
problem. I’m saving up. I was
thinkin’ we could buy an RV or
something. And get out of this godforsaken town. And in style, ya
know? I could show you the country.
We could raise Jason in the home of
the brave. Ya know? Let our boy
smell freedom.
ROMINA
You’re crazy.
LUKE
Why? Why do you say that? You’re
the one who’s crazy to question it.
ROMINA
I’m not leaving my mom.
LUKE
She can come. Bring her. We’ll make
room. Not a problem.
Beat.
ROMINA
What about Kofi?
LUKE
He can stay home.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 16.
Romina gets up from the booth.
LUKE (CONT’D)
So what do you think?
ROMINA
Sounds like a nice dream for you. I
need to get back to work.
LUKE
You know I never knew my dad.
ROMINA
I'm sorry about that. Me neither.
She sets the check, $1.50 face down, in front of him.
LUKE
He didn't give a shit about me.
ROMINA
But you turned out fine, right?
She walks away. Luke scans the check, digs in his pocket.
33

INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - DAY

33

Robin and Luke sit at the kitchen table. A map is spread out
before them. On it - several locations marked with red dots.
ROBIN
These are a few prospects, but I'm
sure we could find some more.
Robin places something swaddled in old flannel rags on the
table. He pushes it toward Luke.
Luke slowly unwraps the flannel - a .38 snub-nosed pistol
sits on the table. Tells him he doesn’t need a gun
necessarily. Tells him that he robbed 7 banks with a note.
ROBIN (CONT'D)
We'd split everything fifty-fifty.
LUKE
Seems like I'm taking most of the
risk. I should get most of the
reward.
ROBIN
I'll just find someone else who
will be happy with an even split.
LUKE
Really? You're gonna get someone
else to rob a goddamned bank with
you? Okay Robin.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 17.
ROBIN
Come on! Don't get lawyerly on me.
(beat)
Sixty-forty.
LUKE
Seventy-thirty.
ROBIN
Sixty-five-thirty-five or go to
hell.
Luke picks up the pistol, tucks it into the back of his sweat
pants. Now he has the power.
34

EXT. ROBIN'S SERVICE STATION - DAY

34

Robin opens his fence and pulls in a beat-to-hell cube truck.
It's white and nondescript.
ROBIN
Doesn't look like much, but it runs
fine. And the back is big enough.
LUKE
You bought this? For this?
ROBIN
You gotta spend money to make
money.
35

EXT. BANK PARKING LOT. MORNING.

35

Luke and Robin sit in the cube truck and discuss the plan.
36

INT. BANK - MORNING

36

Luke walks in the bank. There is a sign that says, “FREE
DONUTS” on the wall. Luke takes a donut. Looks around.
He walks up to the counter.
TELLER
How can I help you today?
LUKE
Hi there, sweetheart. I’d like to
start an account.
Luke sets his money down on the counter. The teller counts
it. He then watches the use a set of keys she has wrapped
around her wrist on an elastic band to open up three separate
drawers. The drawers contains different bills.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 18.
37

INT. ROBIN'S SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

Luke and Robin disseminate their plan. To Luke, it’s like
taking candy from a baby. To Robin, it’s a bit more
intricate.
38

EXT. ROBIN’S. WOODS. LATE DAY.

A40

Luke stands near a river. Contemplating. He HEARS something.
Looks off screen. SEES a doe. Quiet and still as he can, he
reaches for the gun in his waistband. Aims. Squeezes. Fires.
Moments later. He guts the animal.
B40

EXT. MALENA’S. NIGHT.

B40

Luke sets a cooler full of meat on the porch. Rings the
doorbell. Leaves.
Porch light turns on. Kofi answers the door. Sees the cooler.
Romina comes to the door. They open the cooler. Venison
steaks.
40

EXT. ROBIN'S SERVICE STATION KITCHEN - MORNING

40

Robin makes Luke breakfast.
Luke collects his plate, rinses it in the sink. He heads out
the door for his bike. He climbs on his black bike.
41

EXT. TURNPIKE - MIDDAY

41

Luke wears a motorcycle helmet as he bolts down the turnpike;
an empty child's school backpack on his back.
42

EXT. BANK - LATER

42

Luke parks, climbs off, leaves his bike running right outside
the front door of a bank. He checks the time and performs his
OCD ritual before bursting through the door.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 19.
43

INT. BANK- CONTINUOUS

43

INSIDE - Luke, still wearing his helmet, pulls the pistol
from his front jacket pocket and points it theatrically into
the air. He strolls through the bank with measured strides.
LUKE
Ladies and gentleman, listen up.
This is gonna be the fastest bank
robbery you've ever witnessed.
Clipped screams of shock echo through the bank.

The bank falls silent with fear. Luke runs up to the counter
and vaults it, slips off the backpack. 3 female tellers
huddle behind the counter. Luke squats down on his haunches
and finds the one who served Robin before. He pulls the keys
off her wrist and opens the top drawer at her station.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Open up the top two drawers all the

Luke tosses his backpack to another teller.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Hold the bag so she can fill it.

Luke is so happy, probably the happiest he has ever been in
his whole life. His eyes well up with big, heavy tears.
Romina is conflicted, but infected by the joy of the moment.
Luke goes up to the LADY WORKING IN THE ICE CREAM SHOP and

Kofi as he moves to sit on the bed.
KOFI (CONT’D)
I’m not going to say you can’t give

Luke doesn’t stop working.
KOFI (CONT’D)
I want you take all this stuff out

Kofi, anger building, stands.
KOFI (CONT’D)
Take it away.
Kofi reaches down to grab the frame of the crib that Luke is
working on and, in an instant, Luke grabs a wrench, springs
forward and cracks Kofi’s forehead open with it.
Kofi is knocked out. He crashes to the floor, hitting the
back of his head. Concussion. Romina shoves past Luke to get
to Kofi on the ground. Luke watches Romina cradle Kofi’s
head. Malena appears in the doorway.
ROMINA (O.S.)(IN SPANISH)
Mama call an ambulance.
Malena runs out, dials 911. Luke just stands there, invisible
to Romina. She is now unattainable to him.
Luke scoops up Jason in his arms. Walks out of the room with

AVERY
(shakes head “no”)
Seemed emotional though.
KILLCULLEN
Fair enough. Then what?
AVERY
I made my presence known.
KILLCULLEN
How'd you do that.
AVERY
Announced myself. "Police. Drop the
weapon." And when he didn't
respond. I kicked the door open...
and I saw him sitting on the ledge
of the window with... he was
holding a phone...
KILLCULLEN
... and he had a gun?
AVERY
Yeah...
(deep sigh)
...I saw him drop the phone.
KILLCULLEN

AVERY
After he dropped the phone...
KILLCULLEN
And then you returned fire?

Jennifer watches him leave.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI (CONT’D)
There's one thing he wants to do
more than anything else; that's
slide behind the wheel of a radio
car and go back out there and do
the same thing he was doing that
day. Hopefully with better results.
Avery’s face is illuminated by the light from the fridge as
he grabs a beer. He drinks it alone in the kitchen as the

AVERY
It happened so fast. Wasn't time to

JENNIFER
It's scary for me.
I'm okay.

AVERY

JENNIFER
I just can't really believe that
we're dealing with this you know?
It's just so weird...
AVERY
What do you mean weird?
JENNIFER
I guess the fact that you're in
this position. I just never
imagined our life like this.
AVERY
Yeah well it's just part of the job
unfortunately.
JENNIFER
Oh, please.
AVERY
What does that mean?
JENNIFER
Don’t give me these lines, Avery...
AVERY
What lines?
JENNIFER
...About this being part of the
job.
AVERY
This is the job.
Uncomfortable silence. Jennifer is stuck.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 40.
JENNIFER
I’m not a news crew looking for
sound bites about honor and
sacrifice, I’m your wife and I just
don’t get why you’re doing this.
Nobody does.
AVERY
What do you mean? What am I doing?
JENNIFER
Nobody who knows you understands
why you’re doing this.
AVERY
Who? Who are you talking about?
JENNIFER
Nobody. Look, there's just so many
things you could do.
AVERY
Why are you making me feel like I'm
doing something wrong? I'm a cop.
And I don't know why I have to
apologize for that.
JENNIFER
We are just worried about you...
AVERY
Who's "we?"
JENNIFER
I talked to your dad today...
AVERY
There it is. Now I get it. Jesus
Christ.
JENNIFER
... and he agrees with me.

AVERY
Of course he does. Of course
he does.

JENNIFER
We’re all just worried about you.
AVERY
Is that what it is? You two are
worried about me? Or maybe you’re
just worried about yourselves.
Maybe you’re just wishing you had a
lawyer’s salary now?
JENNIFER
Oh come on...
AVERY
No you come on. You go and talk to
my fucking dad about my life? What
do you expect him to say? Huh?
(MORE)

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 41.
AVERY (CONT'D)
What did you think he was gonna
say? And why do you think that it’s
OK for you to go and talk to him?
JENNIFER
I’m sorry Avery, I wasn’t...
AVERY
How ironic is it that I’m being
celebrated everywhere except by the
people who supposedly know me? The
people that supposedly care about
me. I’m a cop Jennifer. That’s it,
there’s no more to discuss.
JENNIFER
Okay, I’m sorry. I just thought
that after all this, that you’d
have had enough. That’s all.
Worried about you.

Avery fills every one’s glasses with some more red wine.
DELUCA
He’s a good looking kid. Gets that

Avery looks at Jennifer as she smiles at Deluca’s charm.
Jennifer serves.

DELUCA
So how’s it living with a hero?
CROWLEY
Probably can’t wait for him to get

Jennifer looks up at Avery. Deluca sees the look. Reads it
clearly. He knows there is underlying tension in this house.
He raises his glass.
DELUCA
To hero boy. Lucky duck. I been on

DeLuca leans in close to Romina, quietly.
DELUCA
How about you assume I have a

reporters. Local news videotapes it. Chief Weirzbowski, in
his best dress uniform, grips a podium.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
Officer Cross is the first member
of his family to join the force.
And not just any force. He joined
the Schenectady Police Department.
He said he wanted to go where the
action was. Well, careful what you
wish for, right?
Gordon beams and the audience laughs.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI (CONT’D)
We can all rest a little easier at
night now that he's on the path of
recovery. Ladies and Gentlemen...
Officer Avery Cross.
The crowd spontaneously applauds. Gordon lumbers over to
Avery and officially affixes a medal of valor on Avery's
uniform. Avery limps his way to the podium.
Thank you.

The crowd wont stop cheering. Avery can’t help but smile to
the adoring crowd.
AVERY (CONT’D)
Thank you Chief for your support...
Raises his hand to quell the clapping.
AVERY (CONT’D)
What happened to me was not special
or heroic... it’s what a police
officer does. I want to thank my
fellow Schenectady police officers
for being here today.
Clapping..
AVERY (CONT’D)
I know, as I look out upon the
faces of the men and women gathered
here today, that each and every one
of you would not hesitate to get in
the way of a bullet in order to
make our streets a safer place.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 52.
More clapping.
AVERY (CONT’D)
When I was in law school I was
surrounded by the discussion of
justice, but that’s just what it
was, a discussion. I joined the
police force because I wanted to
work along side the brave men and
women who know that there are some
problems that simply can’t be
solved by talking.
Avery glances at his father, AL in the audience.
AVERY (CONT’D)
No one wants to be in the situation
that I found myself in a couple
weeks ago. I wish it could have
happened differently... and maybe
some part of me wishes it wasn’t me
called to that house that day...
But that’s the job and for my part
I can’t imagine a line of work I’d

How’s the spotlight?
AVERY
Honestly, I'm ready for it to end.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 53.
AL
Well don't worry it will. You can
be sure of that. Police always put
on a big show when something like
this happens. Because other than
this, what else is there to keep
people motivated? The hero card is
the only one they have to play.
It's the same thing that gets
people signed up for the army.
AVERY
I'm not thinking about all that. I
just want to get back to work.
AL
Well, you can go back. Or you can
go forward. Truthfully Avery if you
had planned this you couldn't have
orchestrated it any better. But
you're not going to make it work
for you within the police
department I promise.
AVERY
What do you mean, make it work for
me? I’m not looking for anything to
work for me. Why does everything
have to be such a calculation in
your world? I’m in a different
world. My life is not a campaign.
I’m trying to give something to
this community. Not get something
from it.
AL
Depends what you want, really. It's
your choice. But for someone not
campaigning, you sure gave a hell
of a speech yesterday. You
certainly had my vote. Plus, that
knee is a goldmine.

OK. That's what I wanted to hear...

The question is can you go back out
on patrol anytime soon? And if you
went out, could you be effective?
AVERY
No, I don’t believe I can.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
I'm glad you're being clear-eyed

There are a lot of jobs that need

this cage. Name the time...
SCOTT
...You name the place.
They shake. Scott leaves, says, "see ya."
Avery heads back into the lockers. Puts the evidence inside.
Once done, he heads deeper into the room, stands in front of
another locker, opens it up. He takes out a cardboard box,
sits on the floor, spreads out evidence: gun, key to his
motorcycle, empty backpack, wallet. Inside the wallet, he
finds a picture of Luke, Romina, and Jason.

EXT. MALENA’S HOUSE TO OLYMPIC DINER - DAY

112

Avery is parked in his unmarked Cavalier across the street
from Malena’s house. He watches Romina get in her car. He
follows her as she drives to work. He can't seem to assuage
the guilt he feels for this woman.
113

INT. OLYMPIC DINER - DAY

ROMINA
What can I get you?
Romina looks up from her pad, sees Avery sitting in a booth.
She tries to hide her contempt for him, looks around for
help, but she is the only waitress on duty. Awkward beat.
AVERY
How are you? How's your boy, Jason?
ROMINA
What’re you doing here?
Avery can't keep eye contact, her eyes full of venom. He
looks down, notices that Romina is pregnant.
AVERY
I’m sorry... I'll just take a
coffee...
Romina walks back into the kitchen. Avery watches her go.
Scott Stevens approaches from behind. He jabs his finger into
Avery’s ribs.
SCOTT
Stick em up.
Avery turns, a little startled.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 57.
SCOTT (CONT’D)
You’re a tough guy to track down...
Scott sits.
SCOTT (CONT’D)
You don’t call people back? I
thought we were gonna meet up...
AVERY
Things have been crazy.
SCOTT
Yeah? You order? I'm starving.
Scott puts his hand up and waves for Romina. "Ma'am!"
SCOTT (CONT’D)
We're dealing with a case, DeLuca
and me. And it's pretty sensitive.
I'm hoping this can stay private.
Avery is listening. Romina comes back to the table, trembling
with fear and rage. She pours Avery's coffee.
SCOTT (CONT’D)
Tuna melt. Large iced tea.
Scott hands her the menu, notices who she is, makes big eyes
at Avery. She turns to Avery, waits for his order. Avery
can't tell if she is terrified or angry. Probably both.
AVERY
I'm fine with coffee.
She takes his menu, walks away. Scott looks at Avery like a
kid who has just gotten away with something.
SCOTT
You trying to fuck her? You sick
fuck...
AVERY
What'd you want to talk about?
SCOTT
Right. I knew I could come to you.
You could really help us bust this
thing wide open.
AVERY
I don't know what I can do, but I'm
here for you.
SCOTT
We have an operation going with
these low level pushers. Kids. It
could lead to their higher-ups, but
we need to convince them we're
legitimate. Now, you know how it
is.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 58.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
You want to sign out drugs or money
for an operation and the list of
regulations... It's insane. As long
as your arm, right?
Romina returns with the ice tea. Scott adds 4 sugars.
SCOTT (CONT’D)
(stirring his drink)
DeLuca and I thought, you know,
you're a stand-up guy. If we can
arrange something where we can
have, you know, temporary access to
the evidence room, and we could
borrow some stuff.
AVERY
I'm listening...
114

INT. ELAN'S STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

114

Girls on stage grind to music and will do anything for a
dollar. Avery and DeLuca share a booth with Scott.
DELUCA
We'll give you a list of what we
need and you pull it out for us.
We'll use it and then get it or
something exactly like it back to
as soon as we can.
AVERY
For this one investigation?
Scott and DeLuca look at one another.
SCOTT
Well, yeah, for this investigation.
But we were hoping this could be
like something we're all involved
in. Periodically. If we need it.
A COKE-HEAD moves quick through the club and ducks into the
bathroom. DeLuca eyes him, lets it slide.
AVERY
Like an open-ended thing?
DELUCA
What the hell? Scott told me you
wanted to help us do some real
police work.
SCOTT
Take it easy, Peter. Avery is
helping. We're just working it out.
Peter smiles. He points to Scott with his thumb.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 59.
DELUCA
My better half.
AVERY
What happens if somebody comes up
for trial and the evidence isn't
there?
SCOTT
That's not a problem...
DELUCA
You just fudge the paper work.
We'll give you cover from the DA.
Also, you should file the
occasional report about how
disorganized the evidence room is.
It's a good hedge if something
surprises us.
AVERY
Why? Why would I do this? What do I
get out of it?
DELUCA
What are you saying? You want us to
bribe you or something? To do your
fucking job?
AVERY
I'm not asking for fucking bribes.
Just assurances. I want to do
what's right, but I need
assurances.
DELUCA
The fuck? You need fucking
assurances? I don't even know what
that means. Assurance? You get that
in law school? Listen, pal, if this
blows up we're all fucked. But you,
see, you make sure it doesn't blow
up. You can walk around all day
looking down your self-righteous
fucking nose at everybody, but
you say you wanna be a cop. Do you?
AVERY
Yes, but...
DELUCA
You wanna see what we're dealing
with? C'mere.
Deluca stands, walks into the bathroom where the Coke-head
disappeared minutes earlier. He beckons Avery and Scott to
follow. Anticipating the adventure ahead, Scott stands,
sighs. Avery follows his lead.

DeLuca sees feet standing inside one of the stalls. Pants

snorting a line.
COKE-HEAD
What the fuck, man?
DELUCA
Gimme your dope.
COKE-HEAD
I’m not doing nothing, man.
DeLuca grabs the man by his hair, jerks his head back, looks
up his nostrils. He pulls the man out of the stall, head
still pulled back.
DELUCA
You’re full of shit.
(to Avery)
See this? No fucking nose hair.
It’s the absolute tell-tale sign of
a fucking coke-head.
(to the Coke-head)
Who’s your source asshole?
COKE-HEAD
I don’t know what the fuck you’re
talking about!
The man is scared, doesn’t say anything. Deluca looks at
Avery and Scott, before yanking him out of the joint.

Deluca and Scott are in front and Avery sits in the back with
the Coke-head. He looks at Avery. Avery looks away.

EXT. PINE BARRENS - LATER
DeLuca leads the cuffed Coke-head into the pines with a
flashlight. Scott and Avery follow. Deluca stops.
DELUCA
Okay shitbag, walk ahead of us and
stand by that tree.
The Coke-head is petrified. Deluca takes Avery aside.
DELUCA (CONT’D)
Okay hero, go find out who his
source is.
AVERY
This is crazy. What are we doing
here?

117

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 61.
DELUCA
This is the fucking job.
Avery looks at Scott. Unspoken, Scott urges him on. Avery
walks to the Coke-head, tries to be a human being.
AVERY
What’s your name?
COKEHEAD
Fuck you motherfucker.
Avery leans in and whispers.
AVERY
Listen. You have any idea what kind
of trouble you’re in here? I need
to know the name of your source so
I can get you outta here.
Junkie doesn’t say anything. He’s not scared of Avery.
DELUCA
What’s taking so long? Do the right
thing, hero.
AVERY
This is your last chance.
JUNKIE
Or what? Fuck you bitch.
The other cops hoot with laughter. Avery is mortified by the
man's defiance and the ultimate ghetto insult - no man calls
another man a bitch without a fight. Avery slams the junkie
up against the tree.
AVERY
Give me a fucking name.
Avery presses the man’s face against the tree. He pulls his
head back and slams against the tree again. Deluca puts his
hands on Avery’s shoulder.
DELUCA
Whoa, whoa... No need to hurt the
guy for Christ sake.
Avery’s breathing hard. He steps back. His hand, bloodied.
DELUCA (CONT’D)
Apologies for my colleague here...
He’s still learning how to be a
cop.
Deluca produces a bag of crack cocaine. He holds it up with
the flashlight on it.
DELUCA (CONT’D)
See this... It’s the real deal.
Give it a taste. It’s all yours.

Avery digs out the shoe box with the plastic bag of money he
took from Romina's place. He quietly walks back to his car.
Avery?

JENNIFER (O.S.)

Jennifer opens the back porch screen door, and comes out in
her nightgown. She sees the bag of money in his hand. He
tries to hide it. They stand there for a minute.
JENNIFER (CONT’D)
Do you wanna talk?
AVERY
I have to go.
OK.
OK.

JENNIFER
AVERY

He goes for his car.
JENNIFER
Are you in trouble?
Avery sighs. At a loss on how to answer.
No.

AVERY

Don’t give me that, Avery. I’m not

Avery can’t respond.

Romina gets off of her shift. Avery climbs out of his car.
AVERY
Excuse me. Don't worry. I'm not

Avery holds out the money for her. Romina won't touch it.
AVERY (CONT'D)

This is yours, not mine. Please.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 64.

inappropriate.
Romina walks over to her car and gets in. Avery follows.
AVERY
I'm not trying to entrap you. Take
it. You need it. For the baby.
ROMINA
I know what they call you... they
call you 'that hero cop'. But you
wanna know what I see when I look

Romina backs out and almost runs over Avery's foot. Avery
watches her drive away.

The end of another long day. But Avery has been waiting a
long time. Weirzbowski calls him in. Avery walks in, sees the
chief gathering his things to leave for the day.
Chief.

AVERY

Avery closes the door behind him. Chief finds it curious.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
What's up, Cross? Don't tell me
you're gonna ask for another
promotion.
AVERY
No. Something else...
Avery reaches in his jacket, pulls out the bag of money.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
What's that doing up here?
AVERY
It came from one of the houses.
During a search. And it's not just
this...
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
(interrupting)
Don't say another word.
Avery puts the money down on the chief's desk. They both look
at it, then at each other.
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI (CONT’D)
What do you want me to do with
this? What do want me to do. What
do you expect me to do?

Avery stands up to leave.

Whoa. Wait a minute. The fuck you
think this is? My desk is not a
place you come and deposit your
problems. You want to take a shit
somewhere then do it but I don’t
want to see it or smell it.
Unfucking believable!
Avery tries to tell him more. The chief takes a couple of
tissues from a box, uses them to pick up the bag of money (so
as not to get his fingerprints on it).
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI (CONT’D)
I want you to know that this is not
good business. This is not the way
to build a career. Now take this
shit outta my office.
He throws it at Avery. Hard.
AVERY
What should I do with it?
CHIEF WEIRZBOWSKI
Shove it up your fucking ass! I

Avery retreats out of the office. Moves through the station
with increasing determination.

He gets into his car - kind of a lengthy process with his bum
knee - has to stick his bad leg in first without bending it.
He's nervous and impatient. Finally gets in.
124

INT. AVERY'S CAR. DUSK.

His heart is racing from the adrenaline. He drives down ERIE
BLVD toward home. Not much traffic. He talks to himself.
Suddenly the lights from a cruiser flash behind him. "What

Avery is covered in sweat. He pulls over to the side. Watches
in the rear-view. The cruiser is parked behind him. Lights
still flashing. He can't make out who is driving, just hazy
silhouettes. The driver's door cracks open. Beat. DeLuca
steps out. Pulls up his pants. Approaches Avery's window.
He rolls down his window.
DELUCA
License and registration.
Avery's thrown off. He reaches into his pocket. DeLuca starts
laughing (deep laugh of a smoker).

The headlights of Avery's car illuminate endless rows of
lonely pine trees. Deluca's tail lights hover ahead, leading
Avery deeper and deeper into the darkness. Avery's heart is
in his throat. He takes his gun out of his holster, sets it
next to him. "where the fuck are you going?"
Deluca turns down a dirt road, and Avery has no choice but to
follow. "Oh my fucking god." Avery stops. Sees Deluca's brake
lights. DeLuca's door opens. Abject terror.
Avery does a super fast and messy 3-point turn to get out of
there. He is nearly hyperventilating.
He peels out sending a cloud of gravel and dirt into the
atmosphere. He straightens out on the main road and drives
like hell out of the forest.

mediator sits at the head. Awkward. Little eye contact.
MEDIATOR
There’s nothing nice about a
divorce. Nothing. But it’s always
better when two people can come to
an agreement without a judge
telling you how you are going to
live your life. Because a judge
doesn’t care about you after he or
she goes home at 5 o’clock. They
don’t care. It’s always better if
you can craft or make your own
deal. That being said I just want
to remind all parties present that
we're not locked in yet and there's
still time to revise the specifics
of this agreement but after these
divorce documents are signed of
course that window closes. Ok? Mr.
Cross, do you fully understand that
in signing this document you are
willingly giving away sole custody
of your son A.J. Cross to your
former wife Jennifer Cross and in
so doing you understand that you
are relinquishing all rights going
forward to make decisions regarding
the parenting of your son. Do you
fully understand the implications

Let me start by saying thank you to
everyone who has come out today to
honor my father's life. I know Al
had a tremendous impact on so many
of you here. He was not exactly
what you would call a low impact
man. I remember as a boy looking at
him in his judges gown and thinking
my dad is a super hero. Now looking
back I think I was not so far off.
My father had that all important
quality as a judge of being both
compassionate and ferocious at the
same time. He was not afraid to
make enemies and because of that he

into a coma I was able to tell him
that I was dedicating my run for
Congress to him.
(chokes up)
He shook his head no. I didn't
understand why he did this. And so
I leaned in close and he managed to
whisper... and he said to me, "I'll
take the win not the run."
People laugh. Jennifer doesn't.
AVERY (CONT’D)
That was Al.

Avery turns around and Jennifer gives him a meaningful hug.
AVERY
I guess this day had to come at
some point right?
Jennifer nods.
JENNIFER
I know how hard this must be for
you.
Avery knows that Jennifer knows the true depth of how hard it
is. He works to stay composed.
Thank you.

AVERY

Avery averts his eyes from Jennifer's stare.
JENNIFER
So I know this is not the ideal
time but I need to talk to you
about A.J. a little bit.
Okay.

AVERY

It's hard for Jennifer to say this...
JENNIFER
He wants to live with you... He
won't stop asking me about it.
AVERY
Really? Well I think he should at
some point.
Jennifer looks at him sadly. She would do anything to keep
him at home.
JENNIFER
This is his senior year Avery.
There isn’t going to be another
point.
AVERY
It's just... a tough time for me
right now. With the campaign and...

Avery looks at his son, shirtless, pale, standing on the edge
of his pool. As if A.J. senses his dad’s inspection, he gets
into the pool.

Yeah son!

AVERY
Who's the other kid?

A.J.
I'm really sorry dad. It was my
fault. I shouldn’t have been there.
I know you don’t have time to deal
with this kinda stuff right now. It

ears.
Not him.

AVERY

Awkward beat.
What?

A.J.

AVERY
Leave that kid alone.
Why?

A.J.

Avery pushes him into the wall. Gets up in his face. Avery's
voice is full of malice but he keeps it at a raspy whisper.
AVERY
Wipe that fucking smile off your
face.
A.J.’s smile has become a terrified quiver.

name of the case: “State of NY VS. Jason Cankam.”
THE JUDGE asks Jason to enter a plea.

Jason sits alone in the gallery of a court house with a
PUBLIC DEFENDER.
Kofi and Romina, both 16 years older, enter the room, shake
hands with the public defender. Jason can’t really make eye
contact with them because he knows how ANGRY they are.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
So, Jason. Seems like you have some
friends in high places?

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 82.
Jason is visibly confused.
PUBLIC DEFENDER (CONT'D)
Just lucky, I guess. I'm getting
some pretty strong signals from the
prosecutor that if you plead
guilty, we can bargain this down to
almost nothing.
ROMINA
What do you mean? Like it will be
dismissed?
PUBLIC DEFENDER
No. If he pleads guilty he'll have
a record. But if we bargain down to
misdameanor possession we can get
some time served from the night in
jail and at worst maybe a fine and
some probation.
ROMINA
And we get that if we plead guilty?
Defender gets up to leave, stacking folders as he goes.

It’s your lucky day, I guess.

Romina enters the room and looks around. Jason closes his
notebook and looks at her. He knows how fucked he is.
She walks over to Jason and slaps him across the face. It’s
the kind of slap that makes your eyes water.
ROMINA
Don’t you ever do that to me.
Jason looks up at his mom. It’s the first time she’s hit him.

SERGEANT
I’ve spoken to countless mothers
just like yourself who feel without
hope for their sons and all I have
to tell you is that what we do here
at the Christian Brothers Academy
works. We do not deviate from our
routine for anything or anyone.
Every cadet does physical training
starting at 6:05 sharp. Then
chores, then formation, advisory,
academics and so on until chores
and lights out at 10 pm. Cadets
have 35 minutes per day of free
time. If this is not respected it
will be promptly retracted. We
believe, Mrs. Cankam, that freedom
is earned. It all comes down to the
character of the individual.
They both look to Jason.
ROMINA
Well, I honestly don’t know what
else there is for us to do.
Jason is shocked. He’s not going here in a million years.
SERGEANT
Well let’s talk to the young man
himself. How do you see yourself
fitting in here, Jason?
JASON
I don’t. I’m not coming here. No
way.
The sergeant is not surprised by Jason’s answer. He turns and
speaks to Romina as if Jason is not there.
SERGEANT
This kind of resistance to the
program is typical Mrs. Cankam.
ROMINA
How much does it cost?
SERGEANT
Tuition for this year is 34
thousand dollars.
Moment of shock.
ROMINA
Wow. Is there any financial aid?

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 85.
SERGEANT
Yes ma’am we do offer financial
assistance to families in need and
you are certainly free to apply for
next year but I’m afraid that at
this point all our funds have been
allocated for this academic year.
Romina is silent for a moment.

No we can’t Jason. We really can’t.
But we will. Everyone’s going to

Everyone in the house goes quiet. Kofi looks to Romina to see
how she wants to answer this. This question takes her aback,
bringing to surface many conflicting emotions. She becomes a

Did you hate him or something?
Romina can’t look at Jason. She can’t look at anyone.

Jason shakes his head, "no." Looks back into the newspaper.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
That's just bullshit. Plain and
simple. Shouldn't be scared of the
truth. Gotta confront it, straight

JASON

Robin thinks about it. Kills his beer.
ROBIN
Why not? Y'need another beer?

INT. ROBIN'S SERVICE STATION. LUKE'S OLD TRAILER. AFTERNOON.

Robin spins tales and opens the door to reveal the dusty old
room where Luke used to sleep.
ROBIN
Not much of a room. Then again, he
didn't need much. Didn't take up
much space. I appreciated that
about him. I truly did.
JASON
Was he good at anything?
ROBIN
You're dad was good at a LOT of
things. Riding a bike for one. It
was like it was attached to him.
Like part of his body. An
appendage. Never saw anyone ride
like him. Unfuckingbelievable. And
he knew his way around an engine.
Oh boy, did he...
Jason is beaming with pride.
JASON
Do you still have his bike?
ROBIN
No. In fact I don't. Police
probably cut it up, and used it for
scrap.
Jason goes back into the rabbit hole of his mind.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
He used to talk about you.
Jason is listening.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Quite a lot, actually. You changed
his life in many ways.
(MORE)

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 94.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Just a shame he couldn't slow down
enough to fully appreciate it. But
I know, and this is a fact, that he
loved you. That he truly did. And I
know if he could see you now, he'd
be proud.
Jason is crying. Not slobbery sobbing cries. But the cries of
a kid who is feeling more than he's ever felt. He tries to
drown it out with a slug of beer. Robin stands in the
doorway, watching him.

Jason produces a ring pop from his pocket and hands it to
her.
VANESSA
I'm not a baby I don't need your

Eat it up. It was a steal.
Jason grabs her nose. She slaps his hand away without the

bucks, you know. But it’s cool. I’m
over it. And I hope you’re over it,

JASON
Yeah, whatever, man.
Jason walks off. A.J. gets up along side him.
A.J.
Hey dude. Dude. My dad is gone this
weekend and so, I'm having a party
at my house tonight - my dad’s
house is seriously ridiculous.
Anyway. I was thinking you should
come over. I know you have the sick

forget about the money you lost me.
JASON
Yeah? I thought we were cool, bro?
A.J.

Jason walks inside the FRONT OFFICE. No one is in there.
Jason waits for a couple beats and looks around. He ventures
into the garage. Dean looks out from under a car.
DEAN
Can I help you?
JASON
Is Robin around?
Dean yells loud for Robin. "KID'S BACK!"
Jason waits, hands in his pockets, looking around the shop,
trying to get a feel for it. It feels good.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 97.
ROBIN (O.S.)
What're you doing back here?
Jason turns, SEES: Robin, with cigarette, approach him. Not
so cordially this time.
JASON
Sorry. Just coming to say "hi." I
was wondering if anybody was
staying in my dad’s old trailer...
you might rent it out to me... or
something...
Robin ushers Jason out of the bay with a whistle and a snap
of his finger.
ROBIN
Come on. Let's get out. Can't have
you back here. Regulations.
They snake through the office and out into the front of the
shop. Robin keeps it moving the whole time.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
I can't have you just walking in on
me like that. It's not
professional. I have a lot of work
on my plate, and I am in no
position to fall behind. I wish I
could spend my days reminiscing and
getting all nostalgic with you
about your dear old daddy. All
misty eyed and shit. But I just
can't. See you down the road,
though.
Robin has walked Jason to the edge of his property.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Oops. Hang on a beat.
He turns and walks to where Jason has parked his bike. Grabs
it. Walks it back to Jason.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
Can't leave without your wheels.
Gotta outrun the woodchucks.
He holds it up for Jason, ensuring he gets on. Jason does.
Robin pats his ass and sends him on his way. Jason feels
pretty dejected. He pedals away.

INT. AUMILLER’S PHARMACY - LATER

Jason enters a pharmacy. Surveys the greeting card section
nervously. He knows what he wants and waits for the
pharmacist to disappear around the corner. He makes his move
and slides behind the counter. Finds a bottle of prescription
OxyContin. Looks nervously around - puts it in his
sweatshirt.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 98.
He makes a run for it. The pharmacist gives chase.
CLERK
Take the shit outta your pockets.
Jason keeps going. The guy tries to stop him. Jason breaks
free and runs out the door. Outside Jason grabs his bike and
tries wildly to run with it as he's jumping on. The guy
chases after him. Jason peddles like mad. Barely gets away.

Sound of music, bass thumping. Jason rides his bike up to a

The MUSIC is so loud that you cannot have a conversation

Jason makes it through the crush of dancing bodies, finds
A.J. in a crowd of kids. They shout to talk.
A.J.
Oh shit! You made it!
They give hugs. Jason is all wet and sweaty.
A.J. (CONT’D)
Damn, bro. You stink!
What?!

JASON

A.J. leans in to shout in Jason's ear.
A.J.
You got the Oxy?!
Jason produces the bottle of OxyContin from his hoodie
pockets. A.J. is beyond psyched. He grabs the bottle and
immediately shows off the score to friends around him.
A.J. walks through the party to the back pool, handing out
the drugs to party goers. An adoring group forms quickly
around him. Jason looks on somewhat dejected. He approaches
the group and waits his turn to receive.
He holds out his hand. A.J. pops the drugs into his hands.
Jason eats them like candy. Someone hands him a beer. He
takes a long slug.

In time the party starts to slow down. Lights blur. Music
seeps deep into his consciousness. He goes and sits down on a
couch. Watches ASHLEY, a girl with an endless mid-riff, dance
before him: so beautiful, so sensual. Jason falls into the
spell of everything.
The girl beckons him up off the couch. He gets up. She keeps
dancing so good. She giggles at him. He's cute to her. She
moves closer.
The room is slowing down around him and her hips and pierced
navel swallow his focus. She pulls him towards her and their
bodies grind together. A.J. checks them out from across the
crowded room.
A.J.’s friend approaches and starts grinding her from behind.
Her movements have changed. She seems to be enjoying the
crude grindings of this other guy. Jason can't get her back.
It disgusts him. His moment is being torn from him. Jason
lets go and moves away. Leaving his girl in an animal
embrace.
Drugs really setting in now, Jason's unstable. He winds his
way through the party, losing his equilibrium. He finds a
staircase, sees a few people up the stairs. He moves towards
them in a moment of pure exploration.
187

INT. A.J.’S HOUSE/AVERY’S - CONTINUOUS

THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS is crowded with dark figures. Jason
can't make out anyone's face, as hard as he squints.
He looks down at the floor to try and center himself, but the
rug is vibrating. Jason steadies himself against the wall.
The wall is covered with photos. Jason zeroes in on a photo
of A.J. when he was young sitting in Grandpa Al's lap. Jason
is sucked in, he moves to the next and the next; pictures of
a fractured and empty family.
Jason finds himself at the end of the hall looking at Avery's
rookie cop photo - the same one paired with Luke from the
paper at Robin's. The drugs are doing their thing but the
power of the picture is undeniable.
Kids shove past him. He tries to stop a few who are too
fucked up to be deterred. Jason manages to get the attention
of a girl. He screams.
JASON
Is that A.J's dad?
GIRL
Yeah. He's like the mayor or
something.
The girl keeps moving. Jason looks deeper and deeper into
Avery's eyes, Avery's smile. Suddenly Jason starts to feel
scared and uneven. Avery's face becomes more and more
menacing to him.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES FINAL SCRIPT 100.
Jason tears his gaze away from it. He moves deeper into the
house opening doors and looking in as he goes. He looks in a
room and finds 2 kids fucking on the carpet. He shuts the
door and fights past kids to another door.
This is AVERY'S MASTER BEDROOM. Jason goes in, closes the
door behind him. Music muffles. He explores the room, knows
he shouldn't be here, but he can't stop himself from
searching.
He opens Avery's drawers, sees a gun, handcuffs and an old
badge buried beneath. Jason stares at them, HEARS the door
open behind him.
A.J. (O.S.)
What the fuck, dog?
Jason closes the drawer, and turns and sees A.J. standing in
the doorway. Jason looks at them as though possessed.
JASON
What the fuck dog?
He walks toward the group with madness in his eyes.
JASON (CONT’D)
Why don’t you tell me what the fuck
A.J.?
Jason walks fast right up to A.J. and pushes him hard in the
face and goes to follow up with a punch. The crowd clears
out, surprised. Jason picks himself up off the floor and
stumbles toward the door knocking into people, creating more
and more animosity for him, as he desperately tries to
escape. A posse forms behind A.J. like a wave forming and
they follow Jason down the stairs to the driveway/yard.
Jason gets tripped up at the patio door and flails into the
lawn. He quickly picks himself up, but A.J. is on him
instantly. He turns to face his attacker, fists up, still
running backwards. Jason is scared shit-less.
A.J. All terror and angst, comes in and knocks Jason in the
side of the head. Jason swings back but his equilibrium is
shattered. A.J. smashes him in the nose, exploding it. Blood
everywhere. Jason covers his face.
Jason falls to the pavement of Avery's long driveway, curls
into the fetal position, tries to cover his body, but A.J.’s
fists and feet are everywhere. Raging. Over and over again.
Someone must have called the police, because in the distance sirens. Kids scatter leaving Jason nearly unconscious. Soon,
flashing lights illuminate his coiled body. A bloody mess.

DOCTOR
Your son has suffered head

injuries...
Romina has a hard time hearing the mention of brain injury.
ROMINA
Is he gonna be okay?
DOCTOR
If it were you or me that'd be one
thing but he's healthy and I have
no doubt that he'll bounce back
quickly. It's the gift of the young
body although we won’t know the
magnitude of his brain injury until
he wakes up. The thing he needs
most at this time is rest and
support from his family.

She turns back to Jason, rubbing his hands. Her face is a
mystery to him, full of secrets, fears, and
misunderstandings.

There's nothing for her to say. She is frozen. Jason stares
at her emotionless. Hears Kofi and Vanessa return to the

lump under the last one. He digs at the lump and unearths a
metal case. Etched crudely onto the front cover are the words
'Brandywine Ave Burner.'
Jason opens the box, finds a pistol. He hefts the beat-up

Jason notices a long hallway leading to the back of the
station. Jason walks down it slowly, comes to a half open
door.
Through the door, Jason sees Robin. Robin stares with deep
concentration at his computer. Jason stands and stares at him
until he suddenly looks up, startled by the sight of Jason...
He pushes himself back in a protective instinct.

Jason pulls out the revolver. He doesn't point it at Robin,
he just shows it to him.

Jason can't bring himself to point the gun at Robin. Robin
sniffs his weakness.

You think you're a fucking man?
Cause you look a lot like a fucking

Jason raises the gun at Robin, without conviction, bottom lip
trembling.

How come you're still alive?
ROBIN
Oh, I get it now. This is where you
come to settle your old man's
