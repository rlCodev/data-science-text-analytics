MUSIC KICKS IN HARD. Smash cut to RON BURGUNDY, 38, walking
through
the heart
of Portland
with a clear
blue sky overhead.
He has a commanding
presence
with an affable
smile
and
perfectly

He's a cross
between
Chuck Woolery
and Chuck's
brother
Sean Woolery.
As he strolls
down the
street
all

seems to embrace
him.

I"ve always been cursed

"drill

Then in high
school
I learned
how to dunk and
could hit the three
from ABA range,
but the coach wouldn't
let me play
with the boys.
So I tried
to get a
job as a lumber jack.
But they
laughed
at me. Then one day I read
the P.A. announcements
