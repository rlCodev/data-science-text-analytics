EXT. LE MANS, CIRCUIT DE SARTHE, FRANCE. NIGHT. 1959.
The Dutray clock reads 3:18 am.
IN THE GRANDSTAND : Scattered spectators, some alert, some
head in hand, some splayed across seats, sleeping.
A unshaven man on the MARSCHAL leaderboard adjusts numbered
tiles, tiles referring to positions of cars as a couple
racers buzz past below. The board indicates first position in
the race is held by CAR NUMBER 5.
IN THE NUMBER 5 PIT. (We know from the sign.) Men wait.
Apprehensive. Weary. Drawn. EDDIE (PIT CREW CHIEF) walks down
the line, clapping his hand, awaking the fuel man.
EDDIE
Coming in. He’s coming in.
Headlights appear from the mist.
The men rub hands, grab tools, take a last drag as -A ROAR RISES. AND SUDDENLY IT’S UPON US. A BEAST. A FILTHY
GREEN AND WHITE 1959 ASTON MARTIN DBR1.
It broadsides to the pits as THE HELMETED DRIVER screechstops. The team descends on the car. Checking tires,
refueling -- WHOOF -THE PETROL SUDDENLY IGNITES, ORANGE AND RED FLAME leaping
from the fuel well across the paint all around the car and
driver’s head and shoulders.
EDDIE (cont’d)
Pit fire! PIT FIRE!
THE DRIVER STUMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, ON FIRE. The men yell at
him to get down.
The flaming driver drops as the crew set upon him with
blankets and primitive extinguishers.
The driver lays there face down, smoldering. The crew moving
to him but he jumps up. Blackened, jumpsuit still smoking, he
pulls his helmet to reveal CARROLL SHELBY, 30s.
SHELBY
FINISH IT! FILL THE TANK! WE GOT TEN
HOURS TO GO! WE’RE IN FRONT!

SHELBY
(Shouts)
AM I ON FIRE?
He turns round, finding only staring, shocked faces.
Surrounded by bright lights, nightmarish hallucinatory
flashes and deafening Doppler sounds as cars rip past.
SHELBY (cont’d)
AM I ON FIRE?!
AM I ON GODDAM FIRE!!!!
PIT CREW
YOU’RE NOT ON FIRE!
They top off the tank and slam his hood as Shelby leaps into
the charred cockpit. He throws it into first and fishtails
out of the pit lane at speed.
SAVAGELY VIBRATING IMAGES

CUT TO:
SHELBY, DRIVING in his burnt jumpsuit. He paws at his
goggles, wiping residue. Determined.
He cranks the wheel of the Aston, downshifts, passing other
cars, seeing the holes before they open.
All sound begins to fade. Soon, we hear nothing but the
whistling of wind and a ticking of a clock.
Shelby...

DOCTOR’S VOICE
Trees and cars blur past out of the mist.
Huge racing tires, spin out of the turn.
Shelby.

DOCTOR’S VOICE (cont’d)
The ticking clock rises, loud.
The wall clock reads 3:18. The second hand sweeps. Out the
window, a sunny lot in the San Fernando Valley.
DOCTOR’S VOICE (cont’d)
Carroll Shelby.
CLOSE ON -- CAROLL SHELBY, maudlin, staring out the window.
He sits on an examination table in his shorts.
What.

SHELBY

REVERSE TO REVEAL -- A bald, bespectacled doctor holds
medical results.
DR. GRANGER
...This isn’t something you can ignore
anymore.
WE ARE : INT. DOCTORS OFFICE. DAY.
SHELBY
I take the pills. The pills work.
DR. GRANGER
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM,
sustained even for a short period, you
run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.
SHELBY
So I’ll race shorter format. Formula
One. NascarDR. GRANGER
The valve’s shot, Shelby. This is as
serious as it gets. In my opinion,
it’s sheer luck you’re sitting here
today.
Silence. Slowly, Shelby smiles... SUDDENLY.. He stops.
SHELBY
Oh I feel real lucky Doc. Right now
I’m the luckiest guy alive..
CUT TO:
EXT. MEDICAL PLAZA. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, CA. DAY
Shelby sits in A GREEN ASTON DB4 ZAGATO in the lot we saw out
the window. He reaches for his pills. Takes out two. Looks at
them. Glances at his reflection in the mirror.
He reaches for his keys. The engine burbles to life. He sits
back. Deep breath. Listens to the heartbeat of the cylinders.
BACK TO:
DR. GRANGER watches sympathetically out of his window at
Shelby sitting in his car. Shelby looks his way and then -FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR, FISHTAILING ACROSS VENTURA BOULEVARD,
NARROWLY MISSING A STATION WAGON AS HE REDLINES ALL FOUR
GEARS AND DISAPPEARS UP A WINDING ROAD, HEADING TOWARD THE
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.

DR. GRANGER
Jesus Christ!
BLACK. A RISING CACOPHONY.....7000 RPM...
EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE. DAY
SHELBY rips through the gears. Shooting the infamous 9 mile
section of road between Cahuenga and Beverly Glen.
SHELBY (V.O.)
There’s a point at 7000RPM where
everything fades...
UP AHEAD -- a car appears... Shelby flies into a sweeping 120
degree corner on the wrong side of the road in second gear.
SHELBY (V.O.)
The machine becomes weightless. It
disappears. All that’s left, a body
moving through space, and time.
Shelby’s Aston hammers the pavement grazing scrub bushes,
through Mulholland corners the road-racers gave names:
Deadman’s, Carl’s Jr, Sweeper, Grandstand, Euro Straight,
Sideways, the Esses, Identicals, and Fire Station 99.
SHELBY (V.O.)
At 7000 RPM, That’s where you meet it.
That’s where it waits for you..
A civilian who thinks he’s driving his Porsche materializes
OUT OF NOWHERE: Shelby reacts, instinct and muscle memory
jibing to avoid him as he flies past disappearing at 130mph.
--Asshole!

PORSCHE DRIVER
Shelby’s blood beats in his ears. He takes a ragged breath.
Road ahead looks like blurry hell. No armco barriers, no
escape lanes, just cliff edge and trees lining the road.
SHELBY (V.O.)
You feel it coming.
A shaking hand pushes a white pill into his mouth. Chews.
SHELBY (V.O.)
It creeps up on you, close in your
ear, and it asks you a question.
Shelby down shifts hard, A BURST OF ENGINE BLARE...

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

SHELBY (V.O.)
The only question that matters.
Shelby screams his lungs out whilst matching revs, lining up,
and throttles to swing the rear of the car through a turn...
SHELBY (V.O.)
Three small words.
...AND HAMMERS IT, upshifting in fractions of seconds into
the straight. Faster than impossible. Faster than death.
SHELBY (V.O.)
“Who are you”?
CU: a “Ford” Ashtray. A golf ball dropped in, rolls around.
WE ARE: INT. OFFICE, FORD MOTOR CO. MICHIGAN. DAY. 1963.
LEE IACOCCA, A slick, Brooks Brother-attired executive,
stands on his desk, nine iron in hand, addressing a tricky
lie out of his ashtray.
IACOCCA
(Under his breath)
The crowd hush. All eyes on the kid
from Allentown, Pennsylvania. Lee
Iacocca. One shot, for the Green
Jacket. One shot at Greatness.
He chips, catching the ashtray which flies across the room
like a UFO and bounces off the large plate window. He winces.
Jumps down and wipes the window. Nothing broken. No one saw.
He wipes the mark with his sleeve..
Stops. He frowns...out his window...
...far below...down twelve floors of mid century mirrored
glass and steel -- A LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE, from this
elevation the size of a cockroach, disgorges A SINGLE FAT
ANT, waving his arms, doted on by a ring of ants.
IACOCCA (cont’d)
(to intercom)
Janine, isn’t the Boss supposed to be
in Florida..
(No answer)
Janine?
Iacocca opens the door of his office to see Janine on the
phone, looking flustered. Behind her, a stream of execs are
moving toward the elevators. She hangs up.

JANINE
Sir. That was Mr. Ford’s office. They
say he wants everyone in management
over to The Rouge. Immediately.
Still holding the ashtray, Iacocca reacts.
INT. THE ROUGE, FACTORY FLOOR. DAY.
Iacocca follows the stream of suits as they file down a
corridor and onto a platform above THE FACTORY FLOOR,
assembling at a railing under a foreman’s station.
LEO BEEBE, Henry Ford II’s Right-Hand Man stands before the
assembled executives in silence. A hush falls as HENRY FORD
II marches out before them.
HENRY FORD II
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.
Beebe signals a Supervisor. LATHES STOP TURNING. PAINTSPRAYERS STOP SPRAYING. THE LINE SHUDDERS TO A STANDSTILL.
HENRY FORD II (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Hear that? Remember that sound. THAT
IS THE SOUND OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY
OUT OF BUSINESS.
He stalks the line, eyeballing them. Whips out the
CONFIDENTIAL memo, hands it to a hapless executive.
HENRY FORD II (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Read the second paragraph.
EXECUTIVE
In 1962 for every Ford driven off the
lots -HENRY FORD II can’t contain himself. He shouts over the
executive:
HENRY FORD II
FOR EVERY FORD DRIVEN OFF LOTS IN
NORTH AMERICA THERE WERE TWO, COUNT’

Grandfather was walking home from
Edison Illumination where he worked a
double shift. He was ruminating. That

Here’s what I want you to do. Walk
home. While you’re walking I want you
to ruminate. Man comes to my office
with an idea... that man keeps his
job! Rest of you second best losers
stay home. You don’t belong at Ford.
Mr. Beebe. Start the Line!
The machines strike up. As he storms out, we scan the
stricken throng, to find -LEE IACOCCA. He looks unafraid. He looks imbued..
INT. OUTSIDE HENRY FORD II’S OFFICE. DAY.
Two secretaries type primly.
SECRETARY
Do you have an appointment?
IACOCCA
Just.. Please. Tell Mr. Ford, Lee
Iacocca from marketing has an idea.
A CRAMPED GARAGE OFFICE. LATE AFTERNOON.
A SET OF WRENCHES hung with care on a peg board.
A HANDMADE SLOT CAR whizzes past on a track built around an
untidy desk, chairs, stacks of paperwork and motor oil cans.
PETER MILES, 12, controls the car, surrounded by framed
photos of a man’s illustrious racing career. He speaks
quietly to himself, lost in fantasy.
PETER
"Now it's Von Trips in the Ferrari
coming into the corkscrew, breaking
late, he's set a new lap record!"
INTERCUT WITH: INT. SERVICE BAY. SAME
In the adjacent service area. Surfaris on the radio. Tires,
Exhausts, Engine blocks. AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER (WAYNE) argues
with boiler-suited legs protruding from under a green MG.
WAYNE (CUSTOMER)
A month ago this was fun. Now it won't
even start. When it does: BOOM BOOM.
All I asked for was a regular service.
Oil change.

The legs don't answer..
BACK IN THE OFFICE -- The slot car Ferrari weaves past a
trash can overflowing with unopened mail. Peter lightens up
on the controller as the car enters a series of curves.
PETER (CONT'D)
"He's in the Esses at 108mph.
Downshifting and--”
The little Ferrari careens off the slot track.
PETER (cont’d)
“--oh, no! He lost his hold! He’s
crashed! Let’s hope he’s alright.”
Peter’s attention shifts to voices rising in THE GARAGE :
WAYNE
No! You’re not listening to what I’m
saying. I pull out the driveway and
the dog has a heart-attack.
Peter stands, accidentally knocking a picture off the wall.
He steps closer to the garage door, listening, watching as-WAYNE (cont’d)
All I'm asking is for you to MAKE IT
LIKE IT WAS.
MILES (UNDER THE CAR)
There's nothing wrong with the car.
WAYNE
Nothing what??
A hand appears from under the car, carbon blackened fingers.
MILES (UNDER THE CAR)
Inlet valves are coked up, which is
restricting intake between the
manifold and the pistons. That’s
what’s making her misfire.
WAYNE
Wanna run that by me in English?
KEN MILES, 40s, oil-smeared, slides out from under the
machine. He stands, wiping his hands.
MILES
Sir, this is a sport car. You have to
drive it like a sport car. Drive it
like a school-teacher, it clogs up.

MILES (cont'd)
Try changing up at 5,000 rpm not two.
Drive like you mean it, hard and
tight, she'll run clean.
WAYNE
Wait. Are you telling me I don't know
how to drive my own car?
MILES
No. But if you ask me this isn’t your
car. Your car’s a Plymouth. Or a
Studebaker.
WAYNE clenches his fist. Squares off. He’s big.
WAYNE
Do you and me have a problem buddy?
MILES
I don’t have a problem. I’ve got an MG
too, mine starts just fine.
WAYNE
Screw you you limey prick. I want my
money back.
MILES
I’d give it to you but you haven’t
paid for last months service yet.
Incensed the man storms around the car...yanks his door open.
WAYNE
This country the customer is always
right. You ever hear of that?
MILES
What utter nonsense.
PETER WATCHES THROUGH A WINDOW as the angry customer gets in.
MILES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I advanced the timing, so she might be
a smidge twitchy in first!
Wayne wheel-spins out, throwing up sparks on the curb,
fishtailing, looking terrified--MILES (CONT'D) (cont’d)
Revs up. Good lad.
MOLLIE (O.S)
Another satisfied customer?

10.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Miles turns to see a beautiful woman in a yellow dress and
sunglasses standing in the opening to the garage.
MILES
Can I help you Miss?
MOLLIE
Wasn’t that an MGA 1500?
MILES
You know your cars..
MOLLIE
I like them. I love the sound they
make. Goes right through you. That
vibration...
MILES
Mine’s the uh...red one. Out front.
She walks straight at him across the garage. Miles eyebrows
raise. She stands close. Stares at him. He swallows.
Is it fast?

MOLLIE

She grabs the spanner he’s holding.
MILES
Very. Wait a second. What type of girl
are you?
MOLLIE
Type of girl likes the smell of wet
gasoline...burnt rubber.
Hot grease?

MILES

MOLLIE
Uhh. I need it.
Miles looks at her. She pushes him back into the wall.
MILES
What are you some kind of deviant?
She throws her arms around him. Smiles.
MOLLIE
Only since I married you.
Miles laughs as they kiss. Peter comes out of the office.

11.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

PETER
Mom. Dad had another fight with a
customer...
MOLLIE
Well, in that case he won’t get any
lamb chops.
MILES
That was not a fight. That was a
debate. This, my boy..is a fight..
Miles picks Petey up and turns him upside down, shaking him
and roaring like a monster. Peter squeals as Miles hauls him
on his shoulder like a kit bag toward a small house across
the street.
CUT TO:
EXT. MILES’ HOUSE -- DAY
Peter fires up the woody before sliding into shotgun, putting
on A BLACK BELL HELMET: “Ken Miles” on the cheek.
Ken lugs boxes and Mollie a holdall and a bedroll into the
back of the wagon. Ken’s fireproofs poke out of the
holdall...out of his sight, Mollie shuts her eyes tight and
kisses his name badge three times, secret superstition,
before tucking them away.
MILES (CONT’D)
Tony'll drop off his Alfa round four.
And if a blue Porsche 356 shows up
tell him
(Mouths "to fuck off")
Check bounced. Otherwise should be
quiet.
MOLLIE
You don't say. Don't let him stay up
too late.
I won't..

KEN AND PETER

They look at each other.
MOLLIE
Go get ‘em boys.
The wagon drives away. She watches them go.

THE GARAGE OFFICE. LATE AFTERNOON.
Locking up the garage, Mollie steps over the slot track and
picks up the fallen picture.
A FADED PHOTO : Ken in a fire-proof suit carried shoulder
high. "Ken Miles.. SCCA Championship Winner 1956."
DING! She turns expecting to see a customer but instead
finding -- TWO MEN IN GOVERNMENT SUITS entering the garage.
MOLLIE
May I help you Gentlemen?
They don’t look like they’re here to get an oil change.
EXT. WILLOW SPRINGS RACEWAY, CALIFORNIA. MORNING.
The sun angles over the desert. Dust. Rows and ROWS of
AIRSTREAMS. Wives, girlfriends getting up. Kids run about.
OUTSIDE ONE -- PHIL REMINGTON, late 40’s, sun-bleached blue
overalls, raps hard on battered aluminum door...
INT. SHELBY'S AIRSTREAM. WILLOW SPRINGS RACEWAY. SAME.
Flat out on a tangled bed, in shorts, Shelby sleeps off a BIG
one. He opens his eyes, reacting to the banging. Huge
Mistake. Lifts his head and bellows like a wounded stag.
REMINGTON (O.S.)
Shelby. Get the hell up.
OUTSIDE -- Remington pulls himself up, peering in the bedroom
window, right behind Shelby’s head. Taps the glass.
Go away!

SHELBY
Shelby splashes water on his face. He stumbles to a table,
pushes through empty bottles, playing cards, lipstick and a
full ashtray to find a pill bottle. He knocks back four pills
with the last inch of Wild Turkey.
REMINGTON (O.S.)
Shelby up and at ‘em, buddy! It’s
6.30am, Baby. Time to roll.
OUTSIDE: Remington lights a smoke and sighs.
BOB BONDURANT
Hey Phil. ...Is Shelby here?

13.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Remington turns to see A DRIVER, BOB BONDURANT, headed toward
the track and the cars lining up for inspection.
REMINGTON
It’s touch and go, Bob.
As Boundurant moves off, Shelby appears in the trailer door,
looking TERRIFIC. Hair slick, clean shaven, cigarette lit.
REMINGTON (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Shelby. You’re up bright and early.
SHELBY
The Early bird gets the worm, Pops.
Shelby flicks green shades over his eyes, and strides off.
EXT. WILLOW SPRINGS RACEWAY. DAY.
Tuned V-8 thunder. Rows of brightly painted race-prepped
Corvettes, D-Types, XKEs stand out against a white desert
dawn. SCCA Race marshals examine each car for Vehicle
Qualification Spec. Engine size, fuel capacity, tire width.
What number?

SHELBY

REMINGTON
Rheinhart? Number 6. Red Faris and
Bill Rushton all in 327’s.
SHELBY
Corvettes. How about Bondurant?
REMINGTON
Driving for Washburn. Number 614.
SHELBY
Relax Pops. We’ll eat the ‘vettes for
breakfast. We’re lighter, we’re
faster.. that don’t work we’re
nastier.
ACROSS THE PADDOCK
In wraparound shades, MILES takes the rear wheel off a Mk 1
289 Cobra in race paint. PETER sits on the hood.
PETER
Dad.. That’s Phil Hill! And Dan
Gurney. Do you know Mr. Gurney?
MILES
Pass me a wheel wrench would you ?-

14.

Peter watches his father crawl back under the car.
PETER
I’m getting his autograph.
MILES
Don’t get lost..
SHELBY ADDRESSES THREE REPORTERS. REMINGTON STANDS BY.
REPORTER
Mr. Shelby, is there any truth to the
rumor Goodyear won’t re-up on your
sponsorship deal?
SHELBY
Son, I’m glad you asked because that’s
what I call horse-shit. We got us a
number of key partnerships. Goodyear.
Ford. AC over in England. And we just
took an order for twenty Cobras from a
franchise in Barcelona, Spain. Yes
Sir. Shelby American is a thriving
international operation.
REMINGTON
Cool. Can I get a raise?
SHELBY
No. You gentlemen have yourselves a
great day.
They walk on.
Twenty cars?

REMINGTON
SHELBY
Pops, if newspapers just told the
truth, wouldn’t be enough paper in ‘em
to wipe a squirrel’s ass.
CUT TO:
MILES TIGHTENS A WHEEL AS A CLIP-BOARD TOTING OFFICIAL
ASSESSES HIS BLUE 98 COBRA MK 1.
SCCA OFFICIAL
Paragraph 15.4 section 2b of the SCCA
standard dictates all AF class cars
must have trunk space with minimum
internal dimensions of 20 inches by 12
inches by six inches.
He puts his test “suitcase” in the Cobra trunk.

SCCA OFFICIAL (cont’d)
Your trunk cannot close. Ergo car

MILES
Can I ask a question? When you were a
little boy did think “when I grow up I
want to go to the fabled Willow
Springs Raceway and enforce Paragraph
15.4 Section 2b of the SCCA regulation
on luggage capacity?
SCCA OFFICIAL
That’s it. I’m ruling you and your
team disqualified from this race.
He slaps a red X sticker on the hood.
ACROSS THE PADDOCK.
SHELBY
Well if it ain’t Lance Reventlow!
Shelby spots a driver chatting to fat rich looking guy.
LANCE REVENTLOW
Shelby. Allow me to introduce Dieter
Voss. Runs Brumos Porsche out of
Jacksonville Florida.
He throws a hand to the fat man with a fatter cigar.
SHELBY
I know all ‘bout Mr. Voss. Having a
hell of a season with that Abarth sir.
VOSS
Seeing results from your Cobra too.
Yer guy Miles is impressive.
SHELBY
USAC road racing champ in ‘61. Won
Pikes Peak Hill Climb. Even won the
SCCA C class 3 years in a row in piece
of shit MG he built himself.

Ken? Ken’s a puppy dog. You drove
against him Lance, tell the man.
LANCE REVENTLOW
I’ve driven more behind him than
against him.
VOSS
Brumos is looking for a driver for our
number two car at Sebring. Think your
Miles could make the grade?
His attention is drawn by the huge stand up row Miles is
having with the official. A few people standing around.
SHELBY
Would you excuse me for one moment?
He marches over. The two men are yelling at each other.
SHELBY (cont’d)
Bill! How’s Patty and the kids? What
seems to be the problem?
SCCA OFFICIAL
The car isn’t within rules.
MILES
The problem is Bill’s an arsehole.
Shelby slaps Miles on the back.
SHELBY
Ah.. He doesn’t mean that.
Yes he does.

MILES
SHELBY
He’s just fooling around.
MILES
No he’s not. He really thinks Bill’s
an arsehole.
Shelby puts an arm around Bill. Leads him away.

that in any disagreement there’s
always a middle ground... I get Ken’s

IN BG, MILES approaches a mechanic. Picks up a mallet.
MILES
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
SHELBY
--So what you say we just bend the ol’
rules here a little. Next time, rest
assured we’ll make damned sure-MILES starts beating the shit out of the trunk lid. Everyone
stares at the madman smashing his car. Peter watches,
clutching his autograph book.
MILES slams the trunk shut. The case fits.
Happy, Bill?

MILES

Shelby sees Voss and the Brumos guys walk away disgusted.
Miles tears the sticker off the car, throws it at Bill.
SHELBY
I’ll handle it, Bill. You go have
yourself a great day.
The official stalks away. Miles goes back to work.

No.

SHELBY
Runs Porsche. Little German car
company. You may have heard of ‘em. He
wanted you to drive at Sebring.
MILES
I thought we felt the same way about
Germans?
Shelby stares at Miles.
SHELBY
Do you like losing?
Excuse me?

MILES
SHELBY
You heard me.
MILES
I don’t lose.
SHELBY
(points to Dieter Voss)
Without sponsors you get no car. Last
I checked, no matter how good you are,
you can’t win in the SCCA without a
car. And if you aren’t winning, Ken,
you are losing.
MILES
Don’t make me throw this at your head.
SHELBY
Did you bring your son out here to
watch you act like an idiot or to get
disqualified? Which?
Miles hurls the tool. Shelby ducks. The wrench goes straight
into the windscreen of Miles’ Cobra. Makes a hole on the
side.
SHELBY (cont’d)
Outside the rails, Ken, I don’t think
you could pour piss out of a boot if
the instructions were written on the
heel.
Shelby walks off. Miles looks to Peter.

EXT. START LINE, WILLOW SPRINGS RACEWAY. DAY
In single file with the rest of the racers, Ken drives his
blue Cobra, (with a taped-up windscreen) on the pit road. A
Race Official in the middle of the track splits the cars left
and right and they lap at a slower speed, Ken glances to his
left: DAN GURNEY in a red Stingray.
GURNEY
(Shout)
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SHIELD?
MILES
(Shouts)
NEW DESIGN...
Just behind Ken, BOB BONDURANT rumbles in his 614 Corvette.
PETER MILES watches from behind the fence. He looks to
Shelby, next to him, who shouts to Miles as he passes:
SHELBY
Let it rip, Bulldog!
Miles implacably raises a gloved thumbs up. Peter smiles.
Coming round, they approach THE GREEN FLAG! AND SUDDENLY -Rubber. Smoke. Wailing tires.
The 1 car blows a shift; Miles stabs the brakes so as not to
ram him.
Other cars fan out, avoiding the 1 and Ken. Cars 2,4,6
(Bondurant in 6) pass on his right, 5, 7 go by his left.
Ken Miles darts around the 1 car, tucking behind the 7.
Fingertip pressure contrasting with savage shifts of
momentum, tires screaming, Miles dives to the inside of 7,
into turn one, tightly packed on the turn with three others.
AT TRACK-SIDE. Shelby watches. Peter enthralled, as -Miles tucks behind the 5 car approaching turn two. As they
enter the turn, 5 gets between car 4 and Bondurant in 6),
Miles just behind and to the left of Bondurant. 2, 4 and 5
start to pull away with a better line. Miles stays side by
side with Bondurant.
Peter climbs the riser to get a better view of the drag race
between his dad and Bondurant toward turn three.
SAM (REPORTER #2)
You miss it, Shelby?

Shelby glances at the reporter, then back at the track.
SAM (REPORTER #2) (cont'd)
Guy wins the 24 hour Le Mans then
suddenly retires... Don’t make sense.
Unless the rumors are true.
SHELBY
What rumors would they be, Sam?
SAM (REPORTER #2)
Oh. That Carroll Shelby quit driving
‘cause he lost his nerve..
Shelby stays focused on the track as -- Miles out-brakes an
astonished Bondurant and storms up the hill toward turn four,
blowing by traffic, hunting the pack ahead of him, among
them, Gurney.
SHELBY
(smiles, watching)
Wanna talk about nerve, Sam? What’s a
bad day for you? Pen leaks messes up
your shirt? There’s always rumors. For
instance, rumor has it Jack Polowski
over there’s been banging your wife

Shelby slaps him on the back.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I’d take no notice. Just rumors.
OUT ON THE TRACK -- LATER.
Miles catches the pack out of a turn on the front straight -American iron thundering by at 150 MPH. Miles pressures Car
5, waiting for an opening. He takes the line away going over
the hill. Storming after the last two cars...
Miles chases down Car 4 and Gurney in his Stingray. Car four
blows its engine, sending him off the track. Miles rockets
through dust and smoke, pressuring the only man left, Gurney.
Gurney turns into the apex of Turn 9 early, thinking Miles
will go inside.
SHELBY (cont’d)
Not yet. Not yet...
Miles settles his car, staying wide, holding a perfect line,
on the edge.

Now...

SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Miles hammers the throttle, makes a late apex, a puff of dust
kicks up in the apex then to the outside of Gurney’s
Stingray. Gurney watches helplessly as-Whoosh-- Miles slingshots past him, full throttle through the
long sweeper, never lifting off, headed to the finish.
Peter cheers!
Shelby lets out a breath. Takes the wrench out of the pocket
of his overalls. He hands it to Remington.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Pops. Frame this.
INT. FORD CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY.
Ford sits brooding beneath a giant portrait of Henry Ford as
Lee Iacocca stands before the top brass, in front of the
slide projector, with his presentation. First slide. Jubilant
WW2 soldiers in New York.
IACOCCA
1945 our soldiers came home. What’s
the first thing they did? They had
sex. Seventeen years later those kids
have grown up, got jobs. Licenses.
Several slides of babies and 50’s cars.
IACOCCA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
They don’t want to drive the same dull
50’s cars their parents drove. Kids
today want glamour. They want sex.
They want to go fast.
A Lotus race car. A Porsche. A Ferrari..
IACOCCA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Gentlemen. It’s time for Ford Motor
Company to go racing.
HENRY FORD II
We’re already in racing, Iacocca.

James Bond doesn’t drive a Ford. He

HENRY FORD II
That’s because he’s a degenerate.
McQueen too.
The gray haired brass all share the Deuce’s disdain.
Don Frey tries to suppress his grin as Iacocca flicks to the
next slide: JAMES BOND IN TIGHT TRUNKS HOLDING A STUNNING
WOMAN ON A BEACH.
See?

HENRY FORD II (cont’d)
ALL THE YOUNG EXECS EYES SHINE WITH ADORATION FOR JAMES BOND.
Exec #1, leans to Don Frey.
EXEC 1
Mommy... Can I be a degenerate,
please?
Iacocca flicks again, but the carousel jumps back to Bond
with his Aston. Then back to him on the beach.
IACOCCA
Give me two seconds here.
The carousel is stuck. Click. Aston. Click. Bond. Aston....
HENRY FORD II
This going anywhere Iacocca?
BEEBE
(smells blood)
Lee. In the past three years your
Marketing Team has presided over one
of the biggest sales slumps in U.S
history. Why exactly should Mr. Ford
listen to you?
All eyes on Iacocca. Sweating. He looks at the stricken
projector like he could heave it out the window. But instead
he switches it off. And flies blind.

IACOCCA
Because we’ve been thinking wrong.
Ferrari won four out of the last five
Le Mans. We need to think like
Ferrari. They..
BEEBE
Ferrari make fewer cars per year than
we make in a day. We spend more on
toilet paper than they do on their
entire output. You want us to be more
like them?
IACOCCA
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history
as the greatest car manufacturer of
all time.
Silence. Ford eyeballs Iacocca. His jaw tenses. Iacocca keeps
rolling the dice.
IACOCCA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Why? Because he built the most cars?
No. Because of what his cars meant.
Victory. When Ferrari wins at Le Mans,
people want some of that victory. What
if the Ford badge meant victory? And
meant it where it counts. Among the
first group of 17 year olds in history
with money in their pockets.
BEEBE
This would take years. Decades of
testing and development for us to
build a race program capable ofIacocca holds up a piece of paper.
IACOCCA
Ferrari’s bankrupt. He’s spent every
lire he has chasing perfection. And he
got there, and he’s broke. We’re the
biggest automobile company in the
world. Imagine it: a Ford Badge on the
nose of that sexy, red machine.
Henry Ford listens.

Iacocca knows he has Ford on the hook. He looks at them all,
his tone serious.
IACOCCA (cont’d)
You said you wanted an idea Sir. Well
here it is. We go racing.
He looks at Beebe.
IACOCCA (cont’d)
But we don’t beat Ferrari. We buy
Ferrari.
Iacocca watches the Deuce, hardly daring to breathe.
Beebe studies his boss too.
He’s thinking about it.

MILES' station-wagon pulls up outside the house. In the
passenger seat sleeps PETER, a huge trophy in his lap.
INT. MILES’ HOME. SAME
Ken kicks open a screen door, his son on his shoulder. Mollie
is waiting. He reads her concerned face and puts a finger to
his lips, carries the boy to his room. Then reappears.
MILES

MOLLIE
The IRS came.
Miles stops. Silent. He clenches his jaw.
MOLLIE (CONT’D) (cont’d)
They padlocked the garage.

MOLLIE
So. To be clear. We're buggered.
Absolutely.

As in, not a bean. Or a pot in which

My tools. My tools were in there!
MOLLIE

No they’re not.
MILES
You stole my tools off the I.R.S?!
MOLLIE
Just the good ones. Sadly the rusty

He reaches into his pocket, counts out bills.

Ken looks at her. Taps his cigarette.
MILES
I didn't have it in the bag until the

care. Petey got his autograph.
MOLLIE
He's not shy, that one.
MILES
Getting a name for himself in the

A FORD motorcade pulls through the gates of the factory. Ford
lawyers, accountants, executives file out, matching hand

when he sees A MUSTACHIOED CAMERAMAN.
IACOCCA
Hey. Hey!

No pictures!
FREY

Striding across the factory floor to meet them. Suit. Shades-GOZZI
Il Commendatore: Signor Ferrari.
As the Ford Translator simultaneously translates.
ENZO/FORD TRANSLATOR
Gentlemen. All my life I am a huge
admirer of your founder, the great
Industrialist, Henry Ford. It is my
privilege to entertain his envoys at
our humble factory.
IACOCCA
We are honored to be invited to this
illustrious place.
INT. ENZO’S OFFICE.
Cramped. Hot. Brown. One side, Iacocca, half a dozen Ford
lawyers and accountants. On the other, behind his desk and
fan, not sweating, Ferrari. As Iacocca pitches, he is
simultaneously translated by A NO NONSENSE ITALIAN WOMAN
TRANSLATOR beside Enzo.
IACOCCA
This merger between our companies will
form two entities. Ford-Ferrari: 90
percent owned by Ford who controls all
production. Secondly, Ferrari-Ford,
the racing team: 90 percent owned by
Ferrari. In order to secure this Ford
will pay the sum of..
(In Italian)
Dieci milioni di dollari..
Enzo, unimpressed by this small burst of lingua franca,
opens the contract. As he does he catches Gozzi’s eye. Gozzi
mops his brow. Ferrari is ice cool. A silent exchange takes
place. Gozzi leaves. Enzo begins to read. Slowly.
IN THE FACTORY COURTYARD -- The sun beats down where a couple
of Ford Execs are smoking. They look to one another.
IN THE OFFICE --- Hours later, ENZO makes small notes in
violet ink. We see on a nearby scratch pad, Enzo’s doodles of
several iterations of a Ford Ferrari combined logo. Enzo
turns to an advisor and asks a question.
FREY
(To Iacocca)
What’s he saying?

29.

IACOCCA
Ssshh..
(Then, quietly)
Gary. What’s he saying?
FORD TRANSLATOR
He’s asking about the race program.
Enzo makes a small question mark in the margin. He reads.
EXT. TURIN COUNTRYSIDE. SUNSET
The sun sinks behind a stunning Italianate Villa. Roaring up
a row of cyprus trees, a MOTO GUZZI motorcycle skids to a
stop. THE MUSTACHIOED PHOTOGRAPHER (from the Ferrari factory)
sprints up the steps clutching an envelope.
He’s stopped by two security men. He looks into the garden
and sees AN ELEGANT OLDER MAN crossing, entertaining guests.
MUSTACHIOED PHOTOGRAPHER
(panting in Italian)
I’m looking for Signor Agnelli. The
chairman of Fiat. I work for him, he’s
expecting me... It’s urgent!

Gozzi waits in a stock room beside a phone, sweating bullets.
The phone rings. He picks it up.

Well... Do you have something to say?
INT. ITALIANATE VILLA. TURIN. DUSK.
The elegant man, SIGNOR AGNELLI, speaks on a fancy telephone.
Nearby is the mustachioed photographer. On the table: B&W

notes on a monogrammed scrap of paper.
AGNELLI
I have the terms. Do you have a pen?

IN THE MARGIN -- A miniature diagram of the Cobra, with its
dimensions. Calculations. Also in violet ink.
Gozzi re-enters. Enzo glances over. Gozzi makes a tiny signalENZO
I have only one small question.
ENZO looks down at the contract. In the margin next to one
clause is the small violet question mark.
ENZO/FORD TRANSLATOR
It concerns my race program. It states
that if I need to increase my race
budget, I have to request
authorization from America.
IACOCCA
Sir with respect, you’re selling your
company. You can’t dispose of it
entirely at your pleasure.
ENZO attends the translation. He fixes Frey:
ENZO/FORD TRANSLATOR
If I wish to enter Le Mans, and you do
not wish for me to enter Le Mans do we
or do we not go?
IACOCCA
In that scenario... if we can’t agree
then yes. No. I mean, that would be
correct. You do not go.
ENZO regards Frey. His mood darkens. All the air rushes out
of the room. And, slowly... he begins.
ENZO/FORD TRANSLATOR
Gentlemen. My integrity. As a
constructor. As a man, as an Italian..
is deeply insulted by your proposal.
Instant sweating. Especially the Translator. Enzo stands.
ENZO/FORD TRANSLATOR (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Go back to Michigan. To your big ugly
factory making its ugly little cars,

his smug executives are worthless sons

The Ford translator stops. Enzo continues in stiff english.
ENZO
...Tell him he is not Henry Ford.
HE IS HENRY FORD. THE SECOND.
Amid the shock, Enzo turns, mildly, to Gozzi. In Italian.
ENZO (cont’d)
Franco. I’m starving. Let’s go eat.
They walk out, abandoning the Ford men in the small office
staring at the translator.
INT. HENRY FORD’S CORNER OFFICE. NIGHT.
HENRY FORD II studies the newspaper. “Ferrari sells to Fiat
for $18 million. Retains full control.”
BEEBE
We got played. Old man Enzo had no
intention of selling to us.
IACOCCA stands before HENRY FORD II.. A few other execs in
the room, among them FREY and BEEBE. All sweating.
BEEBE (cont’d)
He used us as an opportunity to up his
price for Fiat, embarrass our company
and insult your leadership. It was a
bad idea from the start.
The Deuce sits perfectly still.
HENRY FORD II
What. Exactly. Did he say? ..Lee.
A long beat.
IACOCCA
He said Ford makes ugly little cars in
an ugly factory. And its executives
are sons of whores.

Beebe is outraged. Frey stares. Iacocca doesn’t blink.
Henry Ford II’s jaw tightens. He stands. Looks out the
window.
HENRY FORD II
I want... the best engineers. The best
drivers. I don’t care what it costs.
We’re gonna build a race car and we’re
gonna bury that greasy, good for
nothing, devious wop a hundred feet
deep under the Finish Line at Le Mans.
And I will be there to watch it. This
isn’t business. This, gentleman, is
war.

Peter wakes to a metallic klunking sound out his window. He
watches as a figure shuts a trash bin and moves off.
Peter sits up and looks out his other window to see-His father jogging off up the street in his work out clothes.
Peter takes the trophy from last night. He crosses into the

See, I know you. I’ve actually been

MILES
The garage didn’t pay the bills, Mol.
And now its locked up. Racing didn’t

That? Long story. We are goin’ from

Terrific sales. Killing it on the

Mr. Shelby, I’m not here about any

SHELBY (CONT’D)
It isn’t about speed, Lee. It’s not
like other tracks where all you do is
turn left for four hours. Le Mans is
about survival. Endurance. Man and
machine. One weak link, one wrong
move, you might as well stayed home.
You need a car that’s light enough to
travel the straights at 200 miles an
hour. But strong enough to do that for
3000 miles without a break. Not just
the best car you ever built, but
better than whatever Ferrari shows up
with. And that only gets you to the
green flag. That’s where your problems
really start.
Shelby’s assistant stands at the door with something needs
his attention. Shelby crosses, signs it. Notices Remington on
the floor, glaring at him through the glass.
IACOCCA
So it’s challenging.
Shelby turns back to Iacocca. Smiles.
SHELBY
Le Mans is a 3.5 mile loop of country
road. Narrow, ungraded, rough. No
camber on the turns. No rails. Imagine
that for 300 laps. For 24 hours.
Averaging 130. It’s dark, it’s
raining. Slower cars comin’ at you
outta the fog. You see an upturned
Porsche. Driver, pourin’ blood,
stumblin’ around the track. Maybe he’s
a friend. Maybe he’s on fire. And you
gotta hit the gas and fight on, hour
after hour, until it gets light and
finally you see the carnage. You’re
exhausted, hungry, you can’t remember
your name, what country you’re in, and
you realize you’re doing 198 on a
straight. And if at any point you blow
a gasket. A five cent washer. Whole
thing’s over.
Ferrari wins again. Like they won last
year and the year before that and the
year before that.
Iacocca absorbs this.

38.

IACOCCA
So you’re saying you don’t think Ford
can build the greatest race car the
world’s ever seen? You’re saying we
aren’t capable of winning an event
like that? Even if we had a brilliant
partner? Even if we wrote a blank
check?
SHELBY
I’m saying you can’t buy a win, Lee.
(smiles)
But maybe you can buy the man who’ll
get you a shot.

they really hate is guys like you.
Because you’re not like them. You
don’t think like them. You’re
different.
SHELBY
This comes straight from The Deuce
himself. He’s serious. They’re gonna
spend real money.
MILES
I bet they are. You know why? Because
someone and I’m not saying who but
someone told them this was actually
possible.
Miles crosses to the trash with his tray. Shelby puts his
taco down, wipes his hands.
SHELBY
This Sunday at Cloverfield, they’re
launching the new Mustang and they’re

MILES
Am I gonna get kidnapped, drugged,
wake up Monday in England?
SHELBY
(stands)
No. You have my word. Come take a
look. Listen to my speech. Bring
Petey. He’ll love it.
Shelby grins.
EXT. CLOVERFIELD AIRPORT. SANTA MONICA. DAY.
Ford Launch. Banners. Bunting. Catering. Dozens of reporters.
Photographers. Ford executives. Among them, Miles and Peter
walk, sipping Cokes.
CELEBRITY MC
May I present the new Ford Mustang.
Starting at a competitive $2800..
Peter looks in through the side window.
PETER
Wow, dad. Check it out.
MILES
It's a secretary's car, Peter.
Standing nearby is LEO BEEBE. He overhears. He comes over.
BEEBE
Is this your son?
Yes it is.

MILES

BEEBE
Would you please ask him to take his
hands off the paintwork?
Peter overhears. Embarrassed, yanks his hands away.
Sorry Sir.

PETER

MILES
You’re OK Peter. Who are you?

42.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

BEEBE
Leo Beebe. Senior Executive Vice
President Ford Motor Company, special
responsibility for the Mustang launch.
MILES
I see. Well at least now we know who's
responsible. Don't get me wrong LennyIt's Leo.

BEEBE

MILES
Don't get me wrong Leo. Looks
fantastic. But inside it's a cheap
piece of crap dressed up to fool the
public. My advice is lose the Inline 6
and that idiotic 3 speed transmission,
shorten wheelbase. Somehow lose half a
ton. Oh and lower the price. But even
then I'd still choose a Chevy
Chevelle. And that's a fucking
terrible car.
(He slaps his back.)
Nice suit. Come on Peter.
They walk away. Leo Beebe fumes.
CUT TO:
ESTABLISHING - A SMALL PRIVATE PLANE WHISKS THROUGH CLOUDS
INSIDE: Iacocca and other execs, sip Buds. Shelby drains his,
checks his watch and sticks his head in the the cockpit..
SHELBY
How we doin’ Steve..?
PILOT
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby...
SHELBY
Mind if I take a shot at landing?
The pilot looks in shock as Shelby takes the dual controls.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Used to fly B-29s outta San Antonio
back in '44. My instructor said to me
"Shelby, when this wars over do us all
a favor and stay on the ground."

DOWN BELOW -- IN THE CROWD ON THE TARMAC
Miles and Peter move toward the exit. They pass Remington and
Charlie and a few others from the garage.
REMINGTON
‘not staying, Ken?
MILES
Nah. I get the drill. I promised I’d
take Peter to the hobby shop.
...You did?

PETER

REMINGTON
Hang another minute. Carroll would
like that. Listen to his modest
speech, then run for the hills.
Uh..

MILES

CHARLIE
Here they come...
The small plane makes a swoopy, looping approach toward the
runway. It’s not lined up right. Swerves to avoid the control
tower. Wing almost clips. Circles for another approach.
Miles eyes Remington, who snorts. Charlie looks concerned.
PETER
Are they crashing? Who’s the pilot?
MILES
My guess, Peter. Someone we know.
PETER
...Is this part of the show?
MILES
I suspect it is.
INT. COCKPIT. Shelby turns back to the runway at a rough
angle.
SHELBY
Patience. It's all comin’- Whoa.

THE PLANE bounces twice, slews over the runway, and hits a
hundred yards of bumpy grass.

ON BOARD -- Knuckles white, rictus, Ford's Finest shudder as
the craft comes to slewed-stop.
IN THE COCKPIT Shelby takes off Comms. Powers the craft down.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Like riding a bike.
THE DOOR OPENS. SHELBY, STETSON, SALUTES THE CROWD..
REMINGTON
Nothing like makin’ an entrance.
Shelby mingles, works the crowd; autographs, glad-handing.
IACOCCA
Shelby this is Roy Lunn, Head of Ford
Advanced vehicles, developing our
prototype over in England.
SHELBY
I know Roy. How are ya buddy?
LUNN
Welcome to the madhouse Shelby.
SHELBY
Hold that thought.
He separates himself from well-wishers to find -MILES
Nice landing.
SHELBY
Hey Peter. How ya doin'?
PETER
Mr. Shelby, are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?
SHELBY
Well, we're going to Le Mans. Get
across the line first we’ll win.
IACOCCA
Shelby. Allow me to introduce Leo
Beebe, Senior Vice President of Ford
Motors. Leo, Carroll Shelby.
SHELBY
Pleasure to meet you Mr. Beebe. This

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

We've met.

BEEBE AND MILES

MILES
We're gonna go grab us some Cokes.
Good luck with these guys Shelby..
Miles puts his hand on his son's shoulder and walks off.
Beebe leans over to Iacocca.
BEEBE
So. Did you two have a chance to talk
on the plane?
Shelby looks to Iacocca.
IACOCCA
Shelby, step this way with me. Just
for a second.
(moving Shelby off)
There's a few points regarding
procedure we need to go over.
"Procedure"

SHELBY

IACOCCA
Yes. Before you step up there, I want
to make sure we’re on the same page.
SHELBY
What about "Procedure"?
Well--

IACOCCA

SHELBY
"Responsibility for day to day
practical affairs of said Race team
shall rest with Carroll H Shelby.."
That’d be me. That's in the contract.
IACOCCA
Absolutely. And that's why that clause
is in there. Day to day. The what's..
the how's.. that's your job. But in
regard to broader decisions, things on
a wider level, there’s gonna have to
be some give and take with, you know..
No, I don’t.

I’m confused, Lee, cause I was, until
right now, I was comfortable.
AT THE PODIUM.

IACOCCA
Look around Shelby. Whatddya see?
Managers. Marketers. Lawyers.
A-holes.

SHELBY
IACOCCA
Fair enough. But you know what I see?
A machine.
SHELBY
(re: MC)
Shh. I like listening to this.
Iacocca sees Beebe watching him.
IACOCCA
I see ten thousand moving parts
moving, hopefully, in harmony. And I'm
here to make it so, to guide you
through. And to do that, I need to
know you’re gonna be flexible. I need
to trust you, and you me.
Shelby eyeballs Iacocca. The introduction is almost over. He
knows the assurance Iacocca wants but he’s not giving it.

SHELBY
‘Scuse me, Lee.
IACOCCA
Shelby. Do not get on that stage if
you don't trust me.
SHELBY
Excuse me, Lee.
Iacocca yields and Shelby walks onto THE STAGE - Cheers,
applause as he takes the mic.
SHELBY (cont’d)
‘My daddy was here today, he'd tell me
to sit on down leave the yackin' to
the college boys. So like my cars,
I'll make this fast.
Laughter. Beebe slides up beside Iacocca.
BEEBE
What did he say?
IACOCCA
(hiding his terror)
He gets the drill.
BACK ON STAGE -SHELBY
I was ten years old when pops said,
'Son, it's a truly lucky man knows
what he wants to do. Because that man
will never have to work a day in his
life.' But there's a few, a precious
few, and hell, I don't know if they're
lucky or not.. But there's a few who
find something that they have to do.
AT THE BACK OF THE CROWD--- MILES listens. He knows Shelby is
talking to him and him alone.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Something obsesses them. That if they
can't do it, well it's gonna drive
them clean outta their mind.
Shelby stops. Breathing shallow. It takes him a moment before
he raises his head to look at the crowd.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I'm that guy.

48.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

He looks straight at Miles. Miles holds his eye.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
And I know one other man feels exactly
the same.
Neither man blinks.
His name..

SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)

Shelby smiles at Miles.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.
Applause. Cheers. Iacocca and Beebe wave.
IN THE CROWD -- Miles feels his exclusion, but hides it..
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Together, we're gonna make the fastest
automobiles in the world.
(Cheers. Whoops.)
We're gonna make something else too.
History. At Le Mans. My name's Shelby.
I build race cars.
IACOCCA watches Shelby soak up the applause. Signs autographs
at the edge of the podium. IN THE CROWD -- Miles turns to go.
Shelby watches him walk away.

CUT TO:

INT. MINI COOPER. SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND. NIGHT
Shelby drives an unbelievably cramped Mini full of luggage,
rainwater and Phil, holding a map of London. Wipers thrash.
SHELBY
Can you see anything at all?
Not a thing.

Not a clue.

REMINGTON
Last time I was here they dropped me
out of an airplane, made me kill a man

REMINGTON
Is it good if you eat a rat? I had to
eat a rat.
CUT TO:
EXT. FORD ADVANCED VEHICLES, SLOUGH. NIGHT
A very muddy Mini Cooper anchors in heavy rain outside a
redbrick factory. Windscreen wipers thrash frantically.
Shelby and Remington clamber out and are met by Roy Lunn and
others under soaking umbrellas. Pumping handshakes.
ROY LUNN
Welcome to England, birthplace of
motor racing! How do you like our
Mini? Fun eh?
SHELBY
She floats just fine!
CUT TO:
INT. FORD ADVANCED VEHICLES FACTORY, SLOUGH. NIGHT
A kaleidoscope of engineers from the 4 corners of Fords race
program stare at the chassis of the prototype GT.
SHELBY
First up is swap this fancy German 5
speed for something simpler.
ERIC BROADLEY
Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshaven have
designed and supplied gearboxes which
are a miraculous combination of
compactness and load capacity.
Shelby jabs a thumb at Remington.
REMINGTON
Seals where the input shaft passes
thru the R&P section require a higher
oil level so this area of the shaft
runs low on lubricant. Heat buildup in
a 24 hour race means it'll fail.

-In Detroit. How about you?
Shelby looks at JOHN WYER, a tall Englishman in a dark suit.
JOHN WYER
SVA has overall control under Don Frey
but we can't authorize major design
modification.
SHELBY
Eric? Can you swap a gearbox?
ERIC BROADLEY
I work for Lola. Procedure's a

now Enzo's gotta call his mommy he
wants to get under a hood? Hell no.
He's out dialin' that 275P to kick

(grabs a spanner)
Can I pick up this spanner? Or do I
need a requisition first?
WYER
You may not like it, but this is how
things are done at Ford.
Shelby glances at Remington.
REMINGTON
Ate a rat to save these guys.
Shelby rounds on Wyer.
SHELBY
Not any more. Crate this thing. Crate
all of this for shipment.
ROY LUNN
Shipment? Where?
SHELBY
Someplace where I do like how things
are done.

CUT TO:

EXT. MILES’ STREET. NIGHT.
Ken parks the family wood sided station wagon after a long
late shift and gets out, weary. Across the street -- Shelby
sits in shades, on his Cobra, flashes his lights.
Miles looks back at the glow coming from his house.
MILES
Back already? That must have gone
well. Shel, whatever it is30 minutes.

SHELBY

MILES
I’m beat. I want to take a shower.

SHELBY
You want to see this. Trust me. I know
you will. 30 minutes I’ll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.
Miles looks at the house. Sighs. Hops into the bucket.
30 minutes.

MILES

SHELBY
One hour tops.
INT. MILES HOUSE -- PETER’S BEDROOM. SAME.
Peter reads Jules Verne aloud to Mollie who sits on his bed.
She hears a sound and leans back to look through his curtains
and watches as -Shelby fires up his roadster, her husband inside, peels out.
CUT TO:
EXT/INT. LAX AIRPORT. NIGHT
The Cobra pulls up in the shipping receiver's space with
other automotive cargo. There just off the back of a twin
deck car transporter is grey lump. Shelby pulls back the
tarpaulin to reveal - the prototype GT 40.
SHELBY
Fresh off the plane from England.
She's a little on the rare side of
cooked, but there she is.
Ken looks at it. The Ford badge. An airplane screams down the
runway, rises into the air:
SHELBY (CONT'D) (cont’d)
American 212 to Tokyo. Last flight
out. Runway's closed...to air traffic,
that is.
They both look at the open runway, beckoning.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
All I want's your cold, professional
opinion. Then I'll thank you, drive
you home.
He throws him the keys. MILES pauses for a moment.

MILES
My opinion. That's all.
That's all.

SHELBY

Shelby reaches in and starts it. The GROWL is beautiful and
big. Miles smiles.
CUT TO:
Shelby watches him burn away. A dark streak burns across the
moonlit surface of the field.
Miles pushes the car. Hard. Harder. The back end shifts
around. Roar of the big engine thumping in our ears.
Miles tries a basic maneuver. Scowls. Like he’s eating
something horrible. Shoves her into a turn, gets squirrelly.
Miles corrects. Misses a gear change. Corrects again.
INT. HANGAR LAX AIRPORT. NIGHT. LATER.
Ken brings the car back into Shelby. He gets out. Adrenaline
coursing through his body. In the bg., we can see what will
become Shelby’s new and dazzling garage, being set up.
Well?
It's awful.

SHELBY
MILES

SHELBY
It's worse than awful.
MILES
Doesn't track. 3rd gear’s too high,
torque isn’t reaching the pavement.
Steering feels loose cause the front
end gets light. Above 140 it thinks
it'sBOTH
..An airplane..
MILES
..Wants to lift off fly to Hawaii.

Anything else?
Shelby can't help noticing that the engine is still running.
MILES stares straight at the open runway. ENGINE THROBBING.

Let me just...wait here.
Throws it into first. Floors it. Shelby watches. He smiles.
INT. THE MILES FAMILY STATION WAGON. DAY
Mollie drives. Farmers’ market shopping on the backseat. Ken
has a brown bag on his lap, eating chips like a teenager.
MILES
You want some of these?
MOLLIE
No. I’m fine.
Ken looks out of the window and yawns.
MOLLIE (cont’d)
So.. Back late last night.

Working late.
Work?
Uh huh.

MOLLIE
MILES

Mollie stares ahead. Not happy.
MOLLIE
Didn’t..go anyplace?
What?

MILES

MOLLIE
I’m asking did you go anyplace? Last
night.
Mollie.

MILES

MOLLIE
Simple question.
MILES
And I answered it.
MOLLIE
And the answer is?

55.

MILES
I didn’t go anyplace.
Silence. Mollie is a stone.
MILES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Honey, is something up?
Mollie puts her foot on the gas. The car speeds up.
MILES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
No -- Uh. You going too fast, Moll.
Am I?

MOLLIE

MILES
Yes. Slow up. ‘The hell is this?
MOLLIE
You tell me. See I don’t know.
Mollie swerves into oncoming traffic to overtake then back.
MILES
Look out! Whoa!! Are you nuts?
MOLLIE
Maybe. Are you?
MILES
Baby for God sake slow down.
MOLLIE
Why? Thought we love this shit.
What?

MILES

MOLLIE
Just having a little racing fun.

I saw you! OK? I saw you leaving with
Shelby and I saw you coming back.
MILES
OK. Shit. OK.
MOLLIE
All day you’ve got that goofy look on
your face.
MILES
Goofy? Me? Shit would you slow down.
MOLLIE
Only if you tell me what’s going onMILES
-I went to take a look at a car.
With Shelby?

MOLLIE
MILES
Yes with Shelby.
A race car?

MOLLIE

Mollie stamps on the gas. Wangs the steering wheel around.
Maybe.

MILES

MOLLIE
Corner coming, hang on.
Shopping goes flying. Miles hangs on for dear life. The
station wagon careens onto the highway around an onramp.
MILES
Mother of God did you lift off at all
through that?
MOLLIE
Me I like a clean racing line.
MILES
OK. Shel offered me a job! Ford’s got
a car they want to put up against
Ferrari in the GT class.
MOLLIE
You told me you quit!

MILES
I haven’t said yes!
MOLLIE
You told me you were done! Fat and old
you said! Fat and old. You told me
that.
Mollie starts to slow. She brakes and pulls over to the side
of the PCH. Looks out at the ocean waves crashing below.
Her knuckles still white on the steering wheel staring ahead.
MILES
Baby. I don’t understand. Are you
upset because I said I was done or
because I looked at a race car?
Mollie fights the emotions boiling inside her. ThenMOLLIE
Don’t lie to me, Ken! Don’t lie about
what you feel or what you want because
you think the lie will make me happy!
MILES
Baby. I don’t even know what I feel.
MOLLIE
And if you do this, make sure it’s
worth it. Worth the worry. Worth the
fear. Worth it all.
Ken looks her in the eyes. He looks totally open. Calm.
It is.

MILES

Mollie looks like something in her breaks. Shit.
MOLLIE
He better be paying you. Not like last
time. ‘Cause I can’t work any more
hours and look after Petey. The IRS
has the keys to our garage-MILES
It’s $200 a day plus expenses.
Mollie looks up. Stops crying.
MOLLIE
Shit. Really? That--

I know.

MILES

Silence. Off her stare-MILES (cont’d)
I haven’t decided.
MOLLIE
$200 a day? Are you nuts?
Miles starts laughing. Mollie laughs through her tears. A
mess of conflicting emotions. They embrace. The waves crash.
MILES
We’re gonna be OK.
I hate you.

MOLLIE

MILES
I hate you too baby.
They kiss.

thunder crackles past, rubber tire grind scattering.
INT. COCKPIT, FORD GT-40 PROTOTYPE. DAY
MILES throws the machine around the 450ft half circle of turn

ROY LUNN
I shouldn't. I've been up for seventy

BEEBE
Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.
SHELBY
Leo what are you doing at a test
track? You're gonna get Castrol on
that nice suit of yours.
Beebe laughs they shake hands and he motions for them to sit.
BEEBE
Thought I'd drop by to hear your
thoughts on a few planning decisions.
Personnel for Le Mans.
SHELBY
Hell of a line up. Ken Miles. Phil
Hill. Chris Amon. Bruce McLaren.
IACOCCA
Hill's a lock. Amon. McLaren too.
BEEBE
We're less sure about Miles.
BACK TO:
As GT40 turns into the long southern straight Miles tests the
reserves in this beast. At 5000rpm the car just soars like a
rocket ship. He smiles.
BACK TO:
Iacocca doodles on a Ford jotter.
IACOCCA
We like Richie Ginter, Masten
Gregory...Bob Bondurant?
SHELBY
You want the best driver for the car.
Understands the machine. That's Miles.
BEEBE
I may not get the finer points of
racing Mr. Shelby but I know people.
Miles is a beatnik. He dresses like
one. Ford means reliability. Ken Miles
is not a Ford man.
BACK TO:
Rubber warm, Miles lets it rip. He drops a cog and floors it.

64.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Holy shit.

BURT (TEST DRIVER)

The needle on the SPEEDO: hovers 180mph... 190... 200... 205.
BACK TO:
SHELBY
Beatnik? That man landed a bust tank
on the beach at D-Day, drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin. Is that a
beatnik?
BEEBE
Shelby, I have the full backing of-SHELBY
Long time ago, Lee here asked me
what's the one thing money can't buy.
And the real answer is a pure racer
behind the wheel. That’s Ken Miles.
BEEBE
Be that as it may, we think he may be
too pure.
SHELBY
Uh Huh. Too pure. Now explain what the
fuck that means.
BEEBE
It means he’s all about himself.

BACK TO:

Miles brakes hard into corner 6. The car getting out of shape
as he slides it through the bend and powers out of the apex.
The huge V8 exploding behind his head like a controlled bomb.
He can't help but smile as he's thumped back into the seat.
REMINGTON
What's the lap record here?
1.58.

BURT (TEST DRIVER)

REMINGTON
(holds up stopwatch)
1.50 Dead.
ROY LUNN
He’s clocking way over 200MPH.

BACK TO:

65.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

BEEBE
ABC puts a microphone under his nose.
Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.
Millions watching. Do you trust him
not to send the wrong message to
millions of potential Ford buyers?
SHELBY
Well, OK, Sure. You can put a Mr.
Clean cut all American poster boy in
that car, Mr. Beebe. Teach him what to
say. Shit, you can put Doris Day in
there if all you wanna do is lose.

BACK TO:

Miles in the cockpit absorbing g-force through a turn as he
hammers another straight. The SPEEDO: hovering around 207. He
passes the pit. Voooom. They're hit by the pressure wave.
REMINGTON
Gentlemen. That is a race car.

BACK TO:

BEEBE
You're saying you can't agree with us
on this issue?
SHELBY
I'm saying you're gonna have to trust
me on this one.
BEEBE
I'm afraid, with marketing concerns,
that's not possible. Put a Ford type
driver in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.
That's the Ford way.
Shelby looks at Iacocca, who looks at the floor. Back at
Beebe, who holds his gaze..
SHELBY
In that case, Gentlemen you don't need
a race team. You need an ad agency.
Shelby...

IACOCCA
SHELBY
Boys. You tell me I gotta perform a
miracle. You give me only a couple
months to do it.
BEBEE
And bushels of cash...

IACOCCA
Shelby, stop...

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

66.

SHELBY
And I say “okay”. You tell me I gotta
work through your committees and play
nice with all your suits and your
Poindexters. And I say “okay”.
BEEBE
We built you your own God damned
laboratory, Shelby!
SHELBY
And now, it’s quarter to midnight and
we just might be on the verge of
somethin’, and now you tell me-BEEBE
What an ungrateful-SHELBY
-- Now, you tell me I can’t have the
best man in the world behind the
wheel, who knows the thing better than
anyone, because he might step on
someone’s toes while he drives your
unholy beast to victory.
BEEBE
Yes. That’s what I’m telling you.
SHELBY
We're done here. I quit.
Shelby walks away off the rise. Iacocca pursues.
IACOCCA
Shelby’.. Shelby. Wait up.
(He catches up.)
C'mon Shelby'. Don't lose the big
picture. Today's a great day. We're in
with a shot here.
SHELBY
You got ten thousand parts, Lee, all
moving in harmony. You don't need me.
Iacocca gets in front of Shelby, slowing him down.
IACOCCA
Hey. You think Beebe gives a shit
about Le Mans? He just won his Le
Mans. By getting rid of you.

CUT TO:

67.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

SHELBY
Know what? I think you’re scared for
your job, Lee.
IACOCCA
Sure I am. And I think you are too.
Who is Carroll Shelby in five years
time? In Ten. Twenty. What is that
name gonna mean to people? Life has
given you two golden opportunities.
Driving Le Mans in ‘59 and running
this race team. No-one gets three.
Shelby looks at Iacocca.
IACOCCA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Right now, you got to think of one
thing and one thing only. Shelby
American.

CUT TO:

Miles stops the car and pops the door. He gets out. Looks at
the car. Taking its quality in.
MILES
(pulls off helmet)
I can't say how long it can keep that
up...but if it can...
Miles whistles. They all laugh.

CUT TO:

INT. SHELBY AMERICAN WORKSHOP. LAX. DAY.
The mechanics stop what they're doing and turn to the radio
on the bench. Everyone except Miles and Remington: Miles
pokes around the shop gathering wood doorstops, oblivious.
Remington puzzles on the car with a tape rule, re-measuring
the height -- 38 inches.
The radio announcers chronicle “another amazing win by team
Ferrari and its illustrious drivers Bandini and Scarfiotti”.
Miles returns with three wedges and slides himself under the
car, banging them in with a mallet.
Miles looks to Remington who re-measures the height.
MILES
Forty inches?

68.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

REMINGTON
Yeah. But now your carriage is too
high again. Y’gonna have drag down
there.
MILES
(wiping hands)
For one lap. To pass inspection. The
wedges will fall out and we’ll drop
back down to 38.
Shelby walks by. A fistful of paper work.
CHARLIE
I think the title’s in the bag for
Ferrari, boss.
SHELBY
(his mind elsewhere)
...Yeah.
(a thought, turns)
You got a passport kid?
Say what?

CHARLIE

SHELBY
Sign this. Get a passport. You got
till Friday. You too Phil..
He walks off. Charlie is stunned.
CHARLIE
I'm going! I'm going to France..
Ken Miles looks over from underneath the GT40 just feet away.
SHELBY
Ken. Can I get a word?
INT. SHELBY'S OFFICE. DAY
Shelby sits down. Miles enters and grabs Shelby’s doorstop.
MILES
Can I take this?
SHELBY
Take a seat Ken..
MILES
You know why Ford named it the GT-40?
Why they put the 40 on there?

69.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

No Ken.

SHELBY
MILES
Regulations. GT’s gotta be 40 inches
high to make the ground clearance
requirements. No more, no less. They
measure it before every race.
Uh huh.

SHELBY
MILES
Problem is, at that height, we got too
much drag under the car. So we fixed
that but now the car is only 38 inches
high. Anyway, we got a solution.
‘Gonna use wedges to lift the
suspension two inches for the-SHELBY
You're not coming, Ken.
(Miles looks at Shelby)
We're taking McLaren. Chris Amon. Phil
Hill. Bob Bondurant.
(Miles doesn't answer.)
It's Ford's call.
(Miles stares. Unreadable.)
It’s their opinion that you're not a
good image, so you cannot drive their
race car. Putting aside the fact that
you made that car whatever the hell it
is, and that you’re the best man I got
behind the wheel-MILES
(stands)
I'm going to re-route the oil line. If
there's spillage it could end up
dripping onto the rear near side disc.
Ken--

SHELBY

MILES
(stops in the door)
Tell the boys watch their pace come
sunrise. The gearbox will overheat.
EXT. LAX. DAWN.
A plane takes off in the sky. The sun low, KEN MILES runs the
perimeter of the airport.

INT. SHELBY AMERICAN. MORNING.
He arrives at an almost deserted Shelby AMERICAN workshop. An
old janitor is sweeping up. Miles towels off..grabs overalls.
JANITOR
Race is starting soon. Want it on the
radio?
MILES
Not unless you do.
The old man sweeps away. Miles puts on his overalls.
He ignites a reinforced fluo safety lamp casting ghostly
shadows around the dawn gloom of the garage.
Miles slides under the jack-standed car he’s working.
INT. SHELBY AMERICAN. LATER THAT DAY.
Working beneath the car, Miles sees the Janitor leaving.
As the door shuts. Miles looks at the clock, gets up...walks
over to the radio.
ABC'S JIM MCKAY
...McLaren and Amon run to their Ford
GT40s. Surtees runs to his Ferrari.
And the race is off! They’re off a
truly magnificent sight.
Ken walks to an electric teapot and makes some tea.
RADIO
And the leaders appear. It's the
Fords: Chris Amon in front nose to
tail with McLaren in the second Shelby
prepared GT40, Surtees chasing close
behind. The crowd roar, a race is
truly on.
Miles works on an engine. Listening to the race.
INT. SHELBY AMERICAN. LATER. NIGHT.

CUT TO:

Night falls on the vast hangar. Headlights from the cars
passing in the street outside the window cast giant car
shadows across the workshop wall. Behemothic monsters chasing
one another in light and dark.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

RADIO
Ford number 1. New lap record 3
minutes 42 seconds. Top speed 198mph.
Ford lead by 38 seconds.
Miles kneels, listening, watching the shadows. Sipping his
cold coffee... Preps a welder...
RADIO (cont’d)
McLaren in the Ford GT 40 pits, 50
seconds ahead of Ferrari.
MILES takes the welder under the Cobra. On the radio, ABC
interviews Phil Hill:
JIM MCKAY (RADIO)
What do you think Phil?
PHIL HILL (RADIO)
Well. This race is at quite a pace.
Miles works away. Welding. Sparks flying.
MILES
Racing too hot.
CUT TO:
LATER. NIGHT. Miles eats a baloney sandwich. Stops chewing
and cocks an ear to the commentary and engine whine.
RADIO
And the Number 7 Ford driven by
Bondurant seems to be losing power.
Ken’s shoulders drop. Hurts. For him. For them. For it all.
RADIO (cont’d)
Yes it seems Number 7 is out of the
race with mechanical problems.
MILES
Head gasket. Car’s not a moon rocketA plane flies right above the building coming into land.
Throwing shadows of the cobras up onto the workshop walls.
CUT TO:
LATER. NIGHT. Miles revs an engine. Testing it listening.
Then over the engine noise he drops the revs to hear.
RADIO
McLaren is flat out chasing the
Ferrari. He’s tearing through the

esses. He’s taken the lead for Ford.
Ford is in the lead.
Glances at his watch.
MILES
...too soon. Surely too soon.
CUT TO:
LATER. NIGHT. Miles works an angle grinder, sparks flying. He
stops, listening.
RADIO (CONT'D)
Smoke is pouring from McLaren’s GT40,
he’s slowing. Yes. He’s out. Surtees
takes the lead for Ferrari!
MILES
Gearbox. I told them-SUDDENLY --- He looks up.
Who's there?

MILES (cont’d)

Someone steps forward. It's Mollie. She carries a hamper.
MOLLIE
What's that you're listening to..
He looks at the radio.
MILES
Some race. Over in France.
Exciting?

MOLLIE

MILES
I wasn't really paying that much
attention...
RADIO
And it looks like the GT40 of McLShe retunes. Nina Simone. Mood Indigo. Pulls out a chair. He
sits. Miles watches her closely as she opens the hamper, and
removes a bottle and two crystal glasses.
MOLLIE
I'm afraid this isn't actually
Champagne. But it's got bubbles.

73.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

She pops the cork. Pours. Raises her glass.
MOLLIE (CONT’D) (cont’d)
What are we drinking to?
MILES
To Nina Simone.
To Nina.

MOLLIE

Drink. He offers his arm. She takes it. He leads her to the
middle of the facility. And there, among the parts, tires and
wings: they dance together.
MILES
You do know it's 6 o'clock in the
morning.
MOLLIE
It's tea-time in France.
They dance.
CUT TO:
INT. HENRY FORD II'S CORNER OFFICE, THE GLASSHOUSE. DAY
Sport Illustrated on his desk: "Murder Italian Style - Ford
humiliated by Ferrari". To the side, ever-present Leo Beebe.
In front, Iacocca. Ford drops a newspaper. "Ford Destroyed."
"Ford Hammered At Le Mans". "Ford. Humiliation at Le Mans."
IACOCCA
We made mistakes.
(He stops)
Mr Ford. There's a difference between
Ford and Ferrari. Between our methods.
HENRY FORD II
Apart from the fact he came in 1, 2, 3
and we failed to cross the finish?
Apart from the fact we're the biggest
firm in the world and I could lose his
tin-pot operation down the back of my
couch?
INT. DEUCE’S OFFICE LOBBY. DAY
Shelby sits, listening the Deuce’s voice through the door, as
he flicks through a newspaper: "Ford Craps Out. Ferrari In
Front." He takes out his pills, pops a couple, watching as-A YOUNG EMPLOYEE pushes a mail cart. He hands a manila
envelope to the Deuce’s second assistant, who opens it and

74.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

walks the enclosed red folder to the Deuce’s Secretary. She
looks at Shelby as he pops a couple more pills.
BACK INSIDE
BEEBE
Are you insane? The guy's a snake-oil
salesman. A Stetson. Yesterday man. A
good driver who's washed up.
IACOCCA
Shelby is a winner. He knows how.
BEEBE
What you're saying, what I'm hearing,
is that in light of this debacle,
you're prepared to stake your
reputation on this guy.
Neither blinks. Ford watches.
Yes I am.

IACOCCA

INT. DEUCE’S OFFICE LOBBY. DAY
Mr. Ford's secretary puts down the phone and walks toward
Shelby. He watches her closely.
SECRETARY
Mr. Ford will see you now.
SHELBY ENTERS THE OFFICE.
Before she leaves, the secretary puts the red folder on
Ford’s desk, but not before Beebe peeks at it. Shelby watches
her close the door.
SHELBY
Mr. Ford. Gentlemen.
HENRY FORD II
Shelby. Give me one reason why I don't
fire everyone associated with this
abomination, starting with you.
Iacocca shifts uncomfortably. Shelby holds Ford's gaze.
SHELBY
Well, Sir. I’ve been thinking of that
very question as I sat out in your
lovely waiting room. And while I was
sitting there, I watched that little
red folder right there go through five

SHELBY (cont'd)
pairs of hands before it got to your
mitts. And that’s not including the
twenty two Ford employees who must’ve
poked at it before it got to the 19th
floor. With all due respect, sir, you
can’t win a race by committee. It’s
like trying to run with a load in your
pants. You need one man in charge.
Iacocca looks at Shelby in total incredulity.
SHELBY (cont’d)
The good news is, you ask me, even
with the extra weight in the trunk, we
still managed to put ol’ Ferrari right
where we want him.
Did we.
Oh yes.
Expand.

FORD
SHELBY
FORD

SHELBY
Well. Sure we haven't worked out how
corner. Or stay cool. Or stay on the
ground. And a lot of stuff broke. In
fact the only thing that didn't break
is the brakes. Right now we don't even
know if the paint lasts 24 hours. But
our last lap clocked 218mph down the
Mulsanne straight. Now in all his
years of racing, Enzo ain't seen
nothing move that fast. And now, he
knows we're faster than him. Even with
the wrong driver. And the committees.
That's what he's sitting in Modena
thinking about, right now. He’s
worried this year you might actually
be smart enough to give me the control
I need to win.
(looks at them all)
So yes. I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him. You’re
welcome.
Iacocca’s jaw drops. Beebe stares, horrified at Shelby’s
insolence. Ford eyeballs Shelby for a good seven seconds. He
stands. Looks out the window. A crease of a smile.

76.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

FORD
See that little building down there?
In WW2 three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line. You think
Roosevelt beat Hitler? Think again.
This isn't the first time Ford Motor’s
gone to war in Europe. We know how to
do more than push paper. And-(points to himself)
--there is one man running this
company. And you report to him.
(He turns)
Go ahead, Shelby. Go to war.
SHELBY
Thank you, Mr Ford.
Iacocca and Shelby leave. Beebe is panicked.
BEEBE
Mr. Ford, you know I never criticize
your decisions. But Shelby's a
liability. Do you sincerely believe we
can trust him to run an entireFORD
Of course I don't. I don't trust him
an inch. And I never told him he would
be running anything. Shelby's our
wildcard. But he’s not our only card.
(Beebe turns to go)
I'm giving him slack on the leash,
Leo. For now. Come Spring, I’ll put
you in charge. You can make sure we do
things The Ford Way.
CUT TO:
INT. FORD OFFICES. CORRIDOR TO ELEVATORS. DAY.
Iacocca and Shelby walk out.
IACOCCA
I gotta hand it to you Shelby. You've
got some balls.
He smiles at Iacocca. He refers back to Ford's office.
SHELBY
Not even my wife got to screw me the
same way twice, Lee. I'll be in touch.
The lift doors close and he disappears.

EXT. MILES’ HOUSE. HOLLYWOOD. DAY
Miles in running clothes. A bit sweaty. He's carrying a
grocery bag (stopped on the way back). A dog yaps at him.
Outside his house, in the street, is a blue Cobra. Sitting on
the hood, smoking, in shades and a cowboy hat: Shelby.
SHELBY
You were right. It was the gearbox. We
ran too hot. Three out of four broke.
Rod blew on the other.
INSIDE -Mollie is folding laundry. Voices out in the street. The
window open. She looks out.
OUTSIDE -SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
We're goin back.
Miles doesn't react.
SHELBY (CONT'D) (cont’d)
They said I got "carte blanche". I
looked up and it's French for "horse
shit". They'll squeeze our nuts even
harder soon as they work out how.
MILES
The ice cream's melting.
Shelby shakes his head, he's uptight.
SHELBY
You want me to apologize? You want me
to beg?
MILES
I don't know, try it out let's see how
it feels.
Angry. Walks back and forth.
SHELBY
OK. I’m sorry. Sincerely.
(Imploring voice)
"I neeeeed you". Happy now?
(Again)
"I can't do this without yooouuu."

Do you know the shit I have had to eat
just to get four wheels on that grid?

SHELBY (cont'd)
No. YOU DON'T, because you don't to
deal with any of that "crap". Now, we
don't have time for this. You wanna go
in get a shower. We got work to do.
That race car ain't gonna fix itself.
Miles looks at him. He puts the groceries down.
AND PUNCHES SHELBY IN THE MOUTH.
Shelby staggers back.
SHELBY (CONT'D) (cont’d)
Whoa.. OK. OK.
Shelby laughs, half shocked, half impressed. Wipes the blood
from his lip. Shakes his head like he's going to laugh this
off. BUT THEN HIS RED BLOOD BOILS --- And he charges full
pelt at Miles. Picking him up and bum-rushing him backwards
into the trash cans. He both fall on the ground.
FROM THE WINDOW
Mollie looks out of the window. She doesn't react, but gives
a small sigh-DOWN ON THE LAWN
A fight ensues. Both men punching, grappling, choke-holding,
chin-locking, clawing, the whole nine. All over the front
lawn, on the sidewalk, round the Cobra. Everywhere.
FROM THE HOUSE
Mollie appears with a deck chair and a magazine. She sets it
up, sits, lights a cigarette.
Miles picks up the groceries bag and starts throwing cans at
Shelby. He defends himself with the lid of a trash can. He
hits Shelby with the bag. Ice cream goes everywhere.
Mollie glances up from her magazine. An old man walks past
with his dog.
MOLLIE
Morning, Mr. Henderson.
It goes on and on until both men lie exhausted side by side
on the lawn, fighting for breath..
Birdsong. Sprinklers.

MILES
(Panting)
Mollie, honey?
Yes dear?

MOLLIE

MILES
Can I get a soda?
MOLLIE
You want one too Shelby?
SHELBY
Yes please Mollie.
MILES
Uh-uh. Not for him. Just for me
please. He can get his own.
She goes inside. They lie there panting.
MILES (CONT'D) (cont’d)
How long is that now?
SHELBY
Must be three, four years.
MILES
Out at Riverside.
SHELBY
The SCCA Divisional. You broke my
finger.
MILES
I checked that oil pressure. Twice.
Bullshit.

SHELBY

They try to regain their breath.
MILES
That thing you do. That nippy under
the arm thing.
SHELBY
"The Llama bite."
MILES
Where’d you pick that up? The girl
scouts?

80.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

SHELBY
Oh. You wanna go again?
No.

MILES

SHELBY
Thank Christ for that.
Mollie hands them both a soda.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Thanks Mollie.
My pleasure.

MOLLIE

Miles looks at her disapprovingly but lets it pass.
MOLLIE (CONT'D) (cont’d)
Honey I'm going to the store for
groceries. You want me to get anything
special?
MILES
(starts picking things up)
Uh. Let's see. Ice cream. Ice cream
would be good.
MOLLIE
(moving off)
See you later!
Shelby pops his soda and takes out his pills.
MILES
You still taking those things?
SHELBY
Only because they're so delicious.
Shelby puts the pills in his mouth. They clink cans.
SHELBY (cont'd)
Go to hell.

Go to hell.

MILES

ON MOLLIE -- heading off, looks back at them with concern.
CUT TO:

SHELBY AND MILES SIT ON THE PORCH, DRINKING THE SODAS.
SHELBY (CONT'D)
‘Must be quite a burden walking around
with all that integrity, Ken. Must
make your legs tired.
Miles looks at Shelby.
SHELBY (cont’d)
We’re gonna have to cut some of that
weight we want this car to go anywhere
this year. Nothing's stopping you,
Bulldog. Except you.
MILES
Really. How so?
SHELBY
Last month in France, I stood by the
starting line at dawn, mist coming off
the pavement. I could smell the pines
and hear the swifts flying over, and I
had one thought. That I’d give
everything, anything to be climbing in
a car that day. I can’t. But you can.
You just gotta bend a little bit.
MILES
Ford don't get it. They never will.
SHELBY
They don’t have to get it. Ford cares
about one thing. Selling cars. Right
now they need us. And we need them.
You know anyone else got eight million
bucks?
MILES
What is it about you and bullshit
Shelby. Is it the aroma? Or the actual
taste. I mean, which is it.
SHELBY
A delicious combination of the two.
MILES
If Ford could sell one more unit by
screwing us over....
SHELBY
They’d do it. And they’d be right to.
Does Henry Ford owe you a race car
Ken? I don’t think so.

Miles looks at the ground.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
How long have we known each other. In
all that time have I ever broken a
promise to you?
Miles thinks.
SHELBY (cont’d)
I will put you in a driving seat on
the start grid at Le Mans next year,
even if it kills me. Just please try
not to be an asshole.
Shelby-

MILES

Shelby fixes Miles’ eye. He's serious.
SHELBY
Tell me one other thing you've thought
about in the past six weeks.
MILES
I've thought about kicking your assSHELBY
-Apart from that.
Miles looks at him. He stands.
MILES
Get Remington to make up the ring and
pinion gears with an offset angle in
the shims. Lower the friction caused
by vibration. That'll fix the gearbox.
Miles goes inside and shuts the door. Shelby sighs. Looks at
his watch. Starts limping to his car when he sees Mollie
approaching with the groceries.
MOLLIE
Don’t break his heart again.
SHELBY
What? I.. Mollie, he’s not the easiest
guy to-MOLLIE
He wanted a shot. To see what he could
do. You stole that from him. You
should understand what that feels like
better than anyone.

Mollie walks off, leaving Shelby there, keys in hand.
EXT. LAX TEST TRACK. DAY

CUT TO:

Ken Miles laps the GT 40 around the infield road course,
threading the car through hairpins. He pulls into the pits.
MILES
There's still lag when I hit the gas.
Get rid of the vacuum secondaries. Try
a basic cam and rod opening.
REMINGTON
Charlie. Get a Holley carb we're gonna
rebuild the throttle assembly.
The mechanics in the pit work as a unit.
MILES
Three weeks to Daytona...still feels
like a bag of squirrels.
SHELBY
Drivetrain's solid. Brake heat. That's
a whole different ball game.
MILES
We'll get it.
EXT. LAX TEST TRACK - MIDDLE OF THE TRACK. MORNING.
Peter and Miles walk the track in early morning making long
shadows. Miles stops. Rubs his shoe along a rough patch of
surface near a fracture in the asphalt at the head of a bend.
PETER
What are you doing?
MILES
See this crack. That's my marker for
turn 8.
PETER
To slow down?
MILES
Downshift. Touch of brakes.
PETER
But you'll be going a hundred and
fifty miles an hour.

84.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Yup.

PETER (cont’d)
PETER (cont’d)
So how do you see it?
MILES
You're moving fast. But as the car
speeds up everything else slows down.
You see everything.
Miles hunkers down at looks across the surface of the tarmac.
Peter watches his father.
PETER
Do you set other markers?
MILES
Indeed I do. A lot of them.
PETER
Cause you can’t just push the car the
whole way?
MILES
That’s right. You have to be kind to
the car. You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you. If you’re
going to push a piece of machinery to
the limit, and expect it to hold
together, you’ve got to have some kind
of a sense of where that limit is. It
isn’t something that shows on the
tachometer or the oil pressure gauge
or anything else.
Peter gets down on the tarmac his Dad. They are both looking
across the surface.
MILES (CONT'D) (cont’d)
See that. Out there.
See what?

PETER

Peter squints looking in the morning light.
MILES (CONT'D)
Look real hard. Get your eyes sharp.
Close them. Then open them. Out there,
Peter is the perfect lap. No mistakes.
Every gear change, every corner.
Perfect.

Peter is very still.
You see it?
I think so..

MILES (cont’d)
PETER

MILES
Most people can't. Most people don't
even know it's there. But it is. It's
there.
Peter looks up at his dad.
MILES (cont’d)
You want an ice cream?
They run alongside each other, pretending to be driving.
Laughing, as the sun rises.
CUT TO:
EXT. LAX. NIGHT.
Under a starlit sky MILES laps at speed around the track.
MILES’s concentration is total... Accelerating out of the
turn into fourth, now, he sets himself up to brake again for
the turn in at the opposite end of the oval.
Shelby stands near the crew, Mollie and Peter nearby beneath
the tower. They all watch Miles. Shelby turns when he hears a
rapping sound.
Inside the hangar office, Charlie waves a phone receiver at
Shelby through the window. Someone’s calling.
INT. OFFICE. LAX. NIGHT.
Shelby on the phone at a desk covered in papers.
SHELBY
So you’re saying Beebe’s hundred
percent in charge?
Uh. Yeah.
INTERCUT WITH :

IACOCCA

Lee leans low, exhausted. Behind him, suits file out of a
conference room door, among them Leo Beebe.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

IACOCCA (cont’d)
The Deuce is throwing everything at
it, Shelby. He wants to win.
SHELBY
And Beebe has a veto now.
A what?

IACOCCA

SHELBY
A Veto. It's Latin for "Miles won’t
ever drive a Ford."
IACOCCA
(to his assistant)
Just leave it there, Janine.
(back to Shelby, hushed)
I didn’t have to call you, Carroll.
I'm on your side. I fought it. But
it's personal with him. And yes, he
has the leverage to stick it to you.
He's flying in tomorrow to tell you in
person. He’s hoping you lose your
cool.
Shelby looks out his window as Miles roars past on the GT.
Uh huh.

SHELBY
IACOCCA
Look. I get Miles is special, but no
one’s irreplaceable. Nobody’s doubting
his ability to develop the car
mechanically but... some things are
bigger than one man, you know.
No. I don’t.

SHELBY
IACOCCA
It’s time to let it go.
INT. GT40. CONTINUOUS.
Miles, heads toward a turn, throttle wide open. He touches
the brakes. Frowns. His steering wheel shudders. The brake
pedal goes to the floor. The speedometer does not decrease.
He fights down through the gears.
Ah shit.

MILES

87.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

There's a wrenching bang and the car goes out of shape. He
wrestles the steering wheel out of a skid.
INT. SHELBY’S OFFICE / IACOCCA’S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS
IACOCCA
You can’t destroy everything for one
goddam guy.
Sure I can.
But why?

SHELBY
IACOCCA
Shelby hears the sound of the GT out of control. Turns to the
window. Stands.
SHELBY
Cause while we’ve been talking, he’s
getting it done.
ACROSS THE TRACK
REMINGTON
His brakes have locked.
Remington watches helplessly as the car skids out of control
into the turn, spins off the track at terrifying velocity,
headed for the tire wall.
Mollie sees something is terribly wrong.
MOLLIE
Go inside, Peter.
THE OFFICE
Out Shelby’s window, an explosion. Pulling back we see-Shelby is gone. The receiver sits on the table.
IACOCCA (CONT’D)
Hello?..
(Silence)
Shelby- You still there?
EXT. LAX TEST TRACK. NIGHT
Shelby runs past as -CHARLIE
He's off. GO! GO!

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

88.

A waiting ambulance scrambles. Charlie leaps aboard a moving
Firetruck towards the blaze on corner 6. Everyone runs
across.
PETER AND MOLLIE are left standing at the base of the tower
alone. Everyone rushing around and they're in the way.
PETER
What happened, Mom? Is he hurt?
The fire-truck weaves in front of the ambulance towards the
wreck. Remington and Charlie get as close as they can. The
heat holds them back. Black smoke. Roaring flames.
Shelby sprints up.
SHELBY
Get him out of there!
Out of the smoke, through the buckling haze, comes Miles.
Blackened, bloodied. But walking. Rips off gloves. His
helmet. Miles strides towards us, pulls off his hood.
Sweating. Framed in hell-fire and smoke. As he passes Shelby:
MILES
The brakes are a problem.

CUT TO:

INT. SHELBY AMERICAN HANGAR, LAX. NIGHT
Peter watches from a nearby stack of tires as-ACROSS THE SHOP -- The blackened car sits under fluorescent
lights. The men gathered around it, draped on chairs. Mollie
leans against a lift, weary.
Miles is on his feet, still sooty.
MILES
The brakes can’t hold.
CHARLIE
They do for four hours.
MOLLIE
Le Mans is twenty four hours, Chaz.
MILES
...Rip out the damned engine. You
can’t use it if you can’t stop.
Remington has been flipping through a Le Mans rule book. He
takes a pencil and picks up a pad.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

89.

CHARLIE
...Brakes would hold longer if we
slowed down a bit...
MOLLIE
--well that would defeat the point of
having the extra power, now wouldn’t
it, Charlie? You’re there to win the
damned race.
Miles smiles.
SHELBY
Yes, Mollie. That’s true.
REMINGTON
(crossing)
Maybe we could design a new brake
assembly. Instead of swapping out pads
in the pit, swap out the whole brake
system, rotors included. Put in a
fresh one.
MILES
Can we do that?
REMINGTON
(crossing)
I don’t know.
MILES
(picks up rule book)
Brakes are just a part like any other.
You’re allowed to change parts.
CHARLIE
Do we have time to do that?
REMINGTON
(moving off)
I don’t know!
MILES
Let’s make time!
SHELBY
I need coffee. Let’s take five.
Peter’s eyes follow Remington to his desk where he continues
scribbling. Meanwhile, Miles looks to Shelby, concerned by
his behavior. Mollie approaches Ken.

90.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

MOLLIE
I’m gonna take him home. You figure
this out.
Meanwhile, Peter ambles over to Remington.
PETER
So what's wrong with the brakes?
REMINGTON
There’s too much car, Peter. It’s like
trying to stop a train. ‘Brakes work
too hard, they get hot, rotors glow,
start to warp, if the fluid doesn’t
boil first, the discs just shatter.
Peter considers this.
PETER
Have you ever been on fire?
REMINGTON
Well. It’s never happened to me. The
suit's flameproof though. Keeps heat
out.
PETER
But Lewis Evans. He burned to death.
In the Moroccan Grand Prix. He had a
flameproof suit.
REMINGTON
Yeah but see he got stuck. He couldn't
breathe. So long as you get free of
the car, you're okay.
PETER
My Dad got out.
Yes he did.

REMINGTON
Peter looks to his father standing in the mouth of the
hangar. Shelby walks out to join him with a coffee. Mollie
brings the car around.
Petey!

MOLLIE
Peter crosses, jumps in.
You OK?

SHELBY

91.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

MILES
What’s going on? What’s wrong? I don’t
mean the brakes. Or me almost dying.
What is it? Is it something with the
suits?
SHELBY
It's under control.
What is it?

MILES

SHELBY
You know when we talked about how you
do you're thing, and I'll do my thing.
This is my thing.
Shelby-

MILES

SHELBY
Trust me here.
Miles looks at him.
MILES
You got a plan? For the suits.
Absolutely.
A good one?

SHELBY
MILES

SHELBY
It's high risk.
MILES
How high risk.
SHELBY
Extremely high risk.
MILES
Well, that's something.
He pats him on the back, crosses to Remington.

I'm glad we had this talk.

CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING. LAX. NEW DAY.
A large private plane, glints in the sunlight and glides into
LAX as Shelby watches it land.
INT. HANGAR. LAX. DAY
The place is buzzing. Last minute prep for Daytona. Shelby
strides back in the hangar to find Peter.
SHELBY
Peter? I need you to do something. Ask
your dad to take you to Nate's for a
coke and a hotdog.
Now?

PETER

SHELBY
Right now. Here's a fiver. You can
keep the change. Do it. Now.
Shelby flicks the bill into his hand and Peter runs away.
PETER
Dad. Shelby gave me five bucks to get
you to take me for hot-dogs.
He looks over.. Shelby stands twenty feet away. Just by
looking at him Miles knows instantly something's afoot.
Hotdogs?

MILES

Across the hangar Shelby nods.
Hotdogs.

SHELBY

Miles looks out the hangar to see the suits approaching.
Looks back at Shelby.
Hotdogs.

MILES

Shelby nods sagely.
Hotdogs.

SHELBY

93.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Miles looks at his son. He stands. They walk out past Shelby.
MILES
(To Remington)
Pops. We're going for hot-dogs.
They walk out of the hangar. Right past the entering suits.
Close by Beebe. Eyeballing him.
Ken.

BEEBE
MILES
Leo. ..You wanna hot dog?
Beebe winces. Watches Miles and Peter walk away.
Shelby comes out of the hangar at the approaching phalanx of
Ford executives. Spear-headed by H Ford II himself.
SHELBY
Mr. Ford. This is a surprise.
FORD
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion Mr. Shelby. But when a man
pays 9 million dollars for an
automobile he ought at least be able
to see it.
SHELBY
Absolutely. Right this way sir.
As they head over, Beebe button-holes Shelby..
BEEBE
Might I have a word with you?
SHELBY
Sure Leo. In private?
BEEBE
That would be preferable.
SHELBY
Phil take care of Mr. Ford, I'll be
back in a split second.
Remington unveils the GT-40 Mk II for Ford and the Execs.
INT. SITE OFFICE, LAX TEST TRACK. DAY
Shelby guides Beebe into the small office.

BEEBE
Firstly I want to clear the air. I
hope that whatever disagreements we've
had in the past we can put down to
natural red-bloodedness in the heat of
battle
SHELBY
I appreciate that Leo. Truly I do.
As he listens Shelby takes his keys off his desk.
BEEBE
It falls to me Shelby to inform you
that I've been appointed overall
Executive Director of the Racing
program. Now I don't want this to
cause a problem between us.
SHELBY
Leo believe me when I say, I promise
you it will not.
Shelby steps backwards out of the doorway and slams it shut,
turning the key and locking Beebe in the blinded out office.
Beebe starts banging and shouting furiously on the door.
Shelby throws a thumbs up to the mechanic Charlie who
reverses a car in front of the office and starts revving the
engine to cover the noise.

Leo Beebe is losing his shit.
BEEBE
Let me out! Let me out!
BACK OUTSIDE
Charlie stands by the door holding the handle: sees Shelby
signal as he gets into the GT40. Charlie unlocks the door and
finds a raging Beebe.
CHARLIE
Oh god, Mr Beebe are you OK in there?
BEEBE
Shelby, you asshole--

BACK TO:

INT. GT 40. DAY
Henry Ford II is unceremoniously lowered into the car by
every executive in his entourage. Shelby pours A HANDFUL OF
PILLS into his hand and KNOCKS THEM BACK.
HENRY FORD II
Couldn't you make these things a
little easier to get into?
Shelby sees an enraged Leo Beebe running towards them.
SHELBY
We'll bear that in mind for the next
model. Ready?
HENRY FORD II
The word in the middle of that
steering wheel should tell you I was
born ready Mr. Shelby. Hit it.
WHEELS SPIN LEAVING TRACKS OF HOT RUBBER ON THE ASPHALT.
INSIDE THE CAR
Shelby gives it everything. The hefty Henry Ford II is pushed
back, his face like fresh dough kneaded by invisible hands,
his eyeballs out of their sockets. A primal gurgle comes from
his gullet as speed reaches 140MPH.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

HENRY FORD II
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
AT TRACK-SIDE -Everybody watches. Remington leans into two Ford executives.
REMINGTON
It's round about now the uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.
AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY
Shelby turns. The car is sideways. Can practically see his
tailpipes. Anchors into backwards doughnuts, churning clouds
of smoke before whipping the runway, reaching 200MPH and then
running a zero tolerance slalom between oil drums.
The Deuce’s eyes have rolled into his skull. His mouth a
fixed rictus. Only a low groan indicates he's still alive.
They skid to a stop on the tarmac, far from everyone. The
Deuce sits panting. Suddenly, he bursts into tears.
Shelby sits there. Slightly embarrassed, as the crying
escalates. This wasn't quite what he had in mind.
SHELBY
Mr Ford...You OK?
HENRY FORD II
I had no idea.
(sobs)
No idea! Goddamn. If my father, Edsel,
could see this, feel this..beast!
SHELBY
Sir. This is not a machine just anyone
can jump in and easily control.
HENRY FORD II
Absolutely not. I had no idea.
SHELBY
If you want to finish 1st in Le Mans
sir, Ken Miles is the man to do it.
It’s a 24 hour race. It requires
precision, endurance and focus. Ken's
the best racer I ever seen, better
than me maybe, and he knows this car.
He helped friggin’ build it.

97.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

HENRY FORD II
Shelby, as you well know, I’ve
appointed Leo Beebe director of-SHELBY
Which is exactly why I'm talking to
you. I'm not asking you to trust me,
Mr. Ford. I'm here to make a bet. Let
Ken Miles race Daytona. If he wins, he
drives Le Mans.
HENRY FORD II
..And if he doesn't?
SHELBY
Then your boy Leo can fire us both.
Plus Ford Motor gets full ownership of
Shelby American, lock, stock and
brand, free of charge. Forever.
HENRY FORD II
You're very confident in this man.
SHELBY
Yes I am. ..Do we have a deal?
Ford examines Shelby.
HENRY FORD II
As a businessman, Shelby, you terrify
me. You'll risk everything, absolutely
everything, just to win.
Yes, I will.

SHELBY

HENRY FORD II
(wistful)
You remind me of my granddaddy. He
used to say you could tell our family,
if you cut us we bled gasoline.
SHELBY
I take that as a compliment.
CUT TO:
Miles pulls up. Peter is eating a hotdog. He watches through
the windscreen as-The GT 40 pulls up. Ford gets out. Walks around the car on
shaky legs.. shakes Shelby's hand. BEEBE glares furiously,
his eyes flicking to Miles.

98.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Ford whispers to Shelby.
HENRY FORD II
I’m doing you a favor today, son. When
the time comes, I'm gonna ask you for
one. Can I count on you?
He looks at him. Checkmate.
SHELBY
You have my word, Mr. Ford.
Ford smiles. Slaps him on the shoulder.
HENRY FORD II
I shall await the result of Daytona
with interest.
Shelby stands there watching the executives board the plane.
He takes a handful of pills. White as a sheet.
SHELBY
OK. People. Back to work.
Miles approaches Shelby.
MILES
What happened?
SHELBY
What? Oh. The Deuce just wanted to
take a little spin.
(Then)
And he said to say good luck at
Daytona.
He walks away. Feeling both the success of his gambit, and
the weight of his wager.
A ROAR OF ENGINGS AS WE CUT TO:
NIGHT. LIGHTS FLARE AS A PACK OF CARS ROAR PAST AT HIGH SPEED
ON THE DAYTONA TRACK. TIRES THROWING. THE RACE IS ON.
CLOSE ON -- MILES, IN HIS GT-40 IN THE SCRUM. He grits his
teeth and flies into the steeply banked turn.
IN HIS MIRROR -- the green flash of Walt Hansgen's number 95

As Hansgen catches up to Miles, the exchange a look.
Hansgen comes up too fast on a Mustang. The tail of Hansgen's
car wiggles as he brakes hard. Hansgen fights the wheel as he
skids... fish-tailing at 130 MPH.
Miles watches as -Hansgen nicks A MUSTANG which instantly loses its grip and
flies off the track HITTING A PYLON, HARD. Catches fire.
Miles expertly veers around the crash into the infield.
CHARLIE
Jesus-- you see that?
In the Shelby pits, everyone stops.
SHELBY
STILL RACING! WE ARE STILL RACING!
MILES BRINGS HIS CAR INTO THE PITS.
Hansgen right behind him, also pulling in. Wearing miners

out, Ruby leaps in.

cross the pit lane, then hops over the wall.
As Miles approaches in the GT, Shelby scribbles on the board

Tell me about the track, Dad. PleasePeter snuggles down, sharing the drawing with his father.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

MILES
Well. I guess we should start at the
start line.
PETER
But here’s the actual start, right,
because you have to run to your car at
Le Mans.
MILES
True enough. And once your old man
manages to hobble over and pull out -PETER
--and not hit anyone in the scrum-MILES
-- then you have to accelerate, hard,
up to Dunlop bridge, tricky bend,
uphill camber of the road away from
you. Then down through the trees to
the Esses. Braking. Second gear.
Accelerating up to Terte Rouge.
Critical first gear corner. Fast
entry. Keep speed for your exit onto
Mulsanne. Long straight-away. Hemmed
in by poplars. Top gear... 210mph. You
relax on the straight. Refocus.
Collect energy. Then bend down to
third but keep the revs up. Try to get
a maximum exit. Let the car run free.
Over the brow which you can't help
jump but can't damage the car, then..
wham.. the Mulsanne Corner. First
gear. A hair pin. Lot of cars go into
the sand. Oil and fuel on the track.
Third and fourth through the Kinks to

May be.

MILES
Mollie arrives at the door. Miles ruffles Peter’s hair.
MILES (cont’d)
Go to bed now, young man. I’ll wake
you up before I leave.
Peter rolls over and Miles crosses to Mollie. She kisses him.
Pulls him out of the room and he follows her to the bedroom.
CUT TO:
INT. BUS. DAY
Miles’ leans on a window as BUMP...the bus jolts and he opens
his eyes. Sits bolt upright. Where am I? Out of the window

Through the window the shops and passers look very French

EXT. LE MANS OLD TOWN. DAY
Miles gets off amongst ancient stone and timber buildings.
Clouds look like a storm is coming. A PA system announces (in
French) that the Qualifiers start in thirty minutes.
Passers by stream in the same direction... toward the track.
Some rush a car carrier lumbering into town to off-load
numbered Ferraris.
Miles follows the flow, looking for his hotel, checking a
slip of paper. A young kid sells programs of Le Mans 1966.
HANSGEN (O.S.)
Not this time, Ken.
Miles turns and meets eyes with Walt Hansgen and a couple
other drivers in their racing clothes, climbing into an
official van to the qualifier. Hansgen wags his finger.

You know where it is?
The kid points in a general direction of over there.

The kid points again. Same direction. Beyond the crowd, he
sees his hotel in the distance.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ST. PIERRE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Miles carefully unpacks. A distant siren. He pauses then goes
back to work.
He uses a heating element to boil water in his cup as he
watches the crowds outside in the misting rain.
With precision, Miles makes himself proper tea, with fresh
milk. He lays back on his bed. A sudden knock.
Yeah.

MILES
It’s Remington. Subdued.
What.

MILES (cont’d)
REMINGTON
Walt Hansgen went in the fence on his
qualifier. Hydroplaned. Smith told him

Remington says nothing for a moment. Then.

toward -- the grandstand beyond the town.
CUT TO:
EXT. LE MANS GRANDSTAND -- NIGHT
No one here but maintenance. Miles stands in the middle of
the track. Looks up at the leaderboard and down toward the
Dunlop bridge ...and the blackness beyond.
Then he hears a sound. His eyes find, Shelby, in the pits,
obsessively moving some stuff around.
Shelby looks up, feeling Miles. They both smile.
MILES

Leo Beebe conducting a driver briefing. Sixteen drivers sit
in fireproof coveralls. His eyes meet Miles.
BEEBE

Yesterday’s mishap. That's behind us.
Obey your pit signals, follow team

your assigned starting lap time of

competing drivers criss-cross in front of him. He takes a
turn to find himself in-CUT TO:

Grandstands are packed. Crew are scurrying about pushing
their cars to their pole positions for the start. Miles lands
beside Shelby. Together they look over at---Three Ferrari P3s, gleaming as they are wheeled past.

Morning sun streams in the Miles household. Mollie and Peter
in pajamas, watch the Live Satellite broadcast. On the floor
in front of Peter: a big piece of cardboard, the inside of a
cereal box, on which he's drawn every bend in the track. He
mutters to himself as his finger hovers over the start line.
IN FRANCE
Drivers line the pavement across from their cars:
KEN MILES FACES HIS PALE BLUE AND RED NUMBER 1 FORD. HIS
HEART BEATING WITH SECOND HAND OF THE CLOCK.
The second hand ticks to 12... and the Deuce ---DROPS THE FLAG WITH A FLOURISH.
MILES SPRINTS TO HIS CAR, jumps into the cockpit, fastening
his chest harness. Hits the START BUTTON and a giant V8
roars. Slamming the door but it won’t close.
Cars scream off the grid, weaving around each other.
He tries slamming it again. It’s bumping on a loose harness
strap. He fishes out the strap and tries slamming the door
and it seems to latch crookedly. He hits the throttle and
pulls out hard-And suddenly there’s -- A COLLISION! Right in front of Miles’
hood. The Ferraris weave around it out onto the track.

113.

Miles ACCELERATES HARD working his way through the fastest
and most deadly traffic jam in the world, out under--ZOOM! -- The Dunlop Bridge - he realizes his door won't
close. The wind whips in at 100mph. He swaps hands on the
wheel to hold it, swapping hands awkwardly to change gear at
top speed. As Miles struggles, Bandini comes up from behind
and passes him.
UP AHEAD - TWO CARS TOUCH FOR A NANOSECOND... Miles breaks
outside SWERVING to avoid them. Another car breaks inside.
A squealing TIRE touches a kerb and BLOWS.
The other car careens across the track and off, colliding
with a low stone wall, flailing into the air and SPINNING,
harrowing the dirt.
OUT ON THE TRACK -- WHITE HOUSE CORNER
Lorenzo Bandini weaves his superlight Ferrari through lighter
traffic, slamming the corners, having the drive of his life.
He sees McLaren's Ford ahead brake into the Whitehouse corner
and Bandini turns inside him and scorches into the lead.
He glances in his rear view and smiles.

INT. NUMBER 1 FORD. NIGHT. ESSES. RAIN. NIGHT.
CLOSE ON MILES' FACE. A mask of concentration as he expertly
weaves through pelting rain and strobing light, tailing
Gurney through the Esses at 120mph.
Gurney is struggling with a Porsche (AKA: A-hole) driving
erratically and aggressively (given the weather) near the end
of the Mulsanne Straight. Gurney moves to the right, A-Hole
blocks him. Gurney moves left, A-Hole blocks again as they
approach the mile markers for the hairpin.

right to protect his line, then jukes left. Gurney overbrakes and A-Hole opens up the gap.
ANGLE ON -- Gurney, pissed off. He guns for the Porsche
running his monster 427 to 7000RPM against the rain.
MILES
(watching)
...Easy, Dan.
Approaching White House, engine screaming, Gurney is about to
overtake the Porsche when his engine suddenly lets go, blows.
In a flash Gurney is finished and out of power.
Passing the pits, Miles drives harder, shifts higher, brakes
later. Rotors glow – more flame from the exhaust when he
downshifts. He is gaining on the A-hole.
Miles catches the A-Hole at the end of the Mulsanne straight.
Has a bit of the same dance Gurney did with him.
Miles knows this dance – waits later to brake. It’s too deep
into the corner for A-Hole to pull his same shit but tries
anyway. They are neck and neck. Miles feels his wheel
shudder.
UP AHEAD. MILES SEES OUT IN THE STORM - A FLASH OF RED PAINT.
Bandini just ahead of the A-hole.
Suddenly, A-hole pushes it. Tries to pass Miles on the inside
of the corner, but all four wheels hydroplane and he just
goes straight off the track into blackness – he’s out.

A deadly duel tearing through space against time. As they

BANDINI pushes his smaller, harder tuned engine out of the

The steering wheel shudders again. He downshifts. The brakes
go to the floor. His wheels go off the track, terrifyingly,
as he barely makes it around.
Bandini guns further ahead. Joyous. But his elation is
replaced by concern as he suddenly sees his temp gauge is in
the red. Steam rising from his hood.
Miles can no longer race hard with these brakes. Other cars
roar past him as he looks to the pits and grandstand ahead.

Shelby ignores Pops and inconspicuously leans over the

screaming at the Ferrari crew. Shelby grins.

MILES ENTERS THE MULSANNE.
He opens it right up. The awesome power of the GT40 full
bore. As he hits 220, 222, he pulls up behind Bandini.
Racing towards them is the hairpin. The mile markers count
down the distance. Bandini's confident. He knows the heavier
GT40 must brake earlier because Miles needs more time to slow
the GT. The Ferrari can brake later.
The hairpin's racing towards them.
Bandini doesn't brake. He's expecting Miles to brake.
Miles doesn't brake. Bandini glances nervously expecting it.
The hairpin is a 40 MPH turn. They're doing 223.
Bandini's eyes flicker to Miles.
Miles' face is set. Then he smiles. Is it nihilism? A game
of chicken? Does Miles intend to crash both cars?
Bandini blinks. Brakes first. Miles shoots past him. Then he
slams on the brakes. The faster, heavier GT40's velocity
battles friction. Wheels lock. Rubber burns. Tires scream.
Miles feathers his braking a bit to keep the wheels from
locking. The hairpin and destruction race at him. Miles
wrestling to slow, half-skidding. Into the turn.
GT40 slides sideways, the rear breaking loose to the right.
And Miles is already on the gas while coming off the
brakes... trail braking while accelerating through the
turn...taking the lead.
FERRARIS behind the GT40. Bandini, enraged, slams through the
gears. Redlines. Shifts. Redlines. Shifts, trying to catch up
but the GT is already in the distance.

Bandini pushes the Ferrari on the straight.
BANG. An explosion from the Ferrari. It falls back as if shot
backwards from a cannon. Smoke and steam. Bandini blew the
engine.
MILES MOVES INTO FIRST PLACE. Exhilaration as the realization
dawns. Not that he's leading Le Mans. Not that he's leading
the hardest race in the world. A smile grows. He's excelling.
He turns into the sweep of a straight. The road almost clear
of cars, dead and dying machines litter the edge. Not Ken

BEEBE
I don't follow you Lee. What's it got
to do with Shelby.
Leo-

BEEBE
What do you think Mr. Ford? Be the
icing on the cake. Make a great photo.

IN THE PITS
Shelby, exhausted clocks another lap, while Remington shaves.
Beebe comes down.
SHELBY
Not gettin' tired now are you, Leo.
Look like you could use a break.
BEEBE
Oh I'm holdin' up just fine thanks.
Beebe takes his time to exact his revenge.
BEEBE (CONT'D)
Shelby. The Deuce would like to ask a
personal favor..

CUT TO:

ON MILES. IN THE TUNNEL. He sips tea, watches the pits.
MILES’ POV FROM TUNNEL ---Beebe explains what Ford wants.
Shelby's furious reaction. Words muffled by roaring engines.
BACK TO -- The two of them :
BEEBE (CONT’D)
What's your answer?
Shelby looks at Beebe. He looks up at Ford, in the stands. He
pushes past Beebe, away.
IN THE TUNNEL
Miles sits, exhausted, finishing his tea. White as a sheet.
Focused. In his own world. Shelby sits next to him.
MILES
What does Beebe want.
Miles tenses his jaw as Hulme pulls the GT into the pit.
MILES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
You're not doing that thing. So this
is either.. ok, or it's off the
scale..
SHELBY
He wants you to slow down. You're four
minutes ahead of McLaren. The Deuce
wants three Fords to cross the line at
the same time. They want you to be a
‘team player’ and give them a picture.

127.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Miles stares ahead.
MILES
I gotta hand it to him. That's good,
even for him..
SHELBY
Bulldog, I ain't made a single order
stick on your stubborn ass since day
one. Whatever you do, it's fine by me.
Miles looks at Shelby.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Tie for first, you're still the first
man in history to win Daytona,
Sebring, Le Mans. You take the big
one, the triple crown.
Miles suddenly looks exhausted, having to calculate anything
at all after 24 hours...
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Your choice, Ken. It's up to you.
Miles puts his helmet back on. His jaw set.
My choice..

MILES

Shelby nods. Miles walks to the car, looks to Hulme.
MILES (cont’d)
How's she handlin’?
HULME
Running at boiling. Brakes are shot.
CUT TO:
The GT40 screams out of the pit back onto the track. Shelby
watches Miles go.
INT. MILES' CAR. DAY.
Miles drives the battered, stained car back out on the track.
IN THE PITS
Beebe approaches Shelby.
BEEBE
What did he say?

128.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

Shelby watches, silent.
BEEBE (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Shelby! Did you give the order?
Shelby looks at Beebe with utter contempt.
SHELBY
Leo, if there was a "Twenty Four Hour
of Kissing Ass", you'd be world
champion.
Beebe storms off and up the stairs.
IN THE CAR
Miles is very still. Weaving around slower cars.
IN THE PITS
Charlie and Remington stare at the monitor.
INT. FORD BOX.
Beebe and the Deuce and entourage watch their monitor.
IN THE PITS
Miles’ dirt spattered car streaks past. Iacocca is rapt.
Go Bulldog..

IACOCCA

IN THE CAR
Miles begins to shift like never before. Streaks through a
corner in an immaculate apex and guns out into the straight
like a rocket, threading past other cars.
IN THE PITS
All of the Ferrari team approach the track, awaiting..
IN THE STANDS
They're on their feet. Wild. Stamping, chanting Miles' name.
All feeling it viscerally..
ON THE TRACK
Miles in total control. On the Mulsanne straight, opens it
up. The trees strobe. Miles goes faster. Faster.

IN THE LE MANS COMMITTEE
BEEBE
What the hell is he doing?
Beebe crosses to the phone. Dials furiously.
IN THE PIT. THE PHONE RINGS.
Carroll Smith crosses to answer. Shelby glares:
SHELBY
Do not answer that.
ON THE TRACK
Miles slingshots into the final straight at 232MPH.
MILES is flying now. Man and machine as one...
IN THE CAR
Miles smiles and begins his final maneuver. Passing one, two,
three, four, five cars..
IN THE PITS
Shelby watches as Miles navigates the hairpin. Remington
stares at his stopwatch. Charlie looks over his shoulder.
CHARLIE
...he’s gonna break his own record.
Shut up.

REMINGTON
ON SHELBY, CLOSE:
SHELBY
Wait for it. Wait for it. Hold hold.
(Then)
Now.

Miles twitches out and threads between the two like a bullet,
just making the Apex into the final corner..

PETER
It’s a perfect lap...
IN THE PITS. SHELBY, TOTALLY STILL.
Now go..

SHELBY

ON THE TRACK
The GT-40 roars up the home straight. Two hundred miles an
hour. Two ten. Two twenty. Two thirty. And crosses the START
FINISH LINE --- the roaring heart of Miles' GT40 thunders
through at 232 MPH.
IN THE PITS
The engineers go crazy. Remington hits his stopwatches.
REMINGTON
3.30.6 that's a record!!!
THE GRANDSTAND
Explodes! The fastest lap in history, ever. By the greatest
driver ever to drive at Le Mans.
IN THE EXECUTIVE BOX
IACOCCA goes wild next to a glowering BEEBE who claps slowly.
THE TUNNELS UNDER THE STANDS
ENZO FERRARI, cocks his ear, listens to the roar of the crowd
above. The cheering fans drowning out even the engine sounds.
He walks steps out of an access tunnel to see Miles streak
past at unbelievable speed.
Bellissimo.

PETER
You did it. You did it, Dad.

MOLLIE, tears in her eyes, overflowing with love and pride.
IN THE PITS
SHELBY nods. The struggle. The heartache. This is it. More
than just a race to the finish. This...is greatness.
LEO BEEBE bursts into the pit and runs up to Shelby yelling
but no one is listening to his ravings...
BEEBE
Bring him in. He’s out of control. He
breaks that car, we won’t finish. You
need me, Shelby. If you don’t bring
him in, I’ll see to it this is the
last time you race anywhere but Willow
Springs.
Shelby steps away, toward the rail. All eyes in the Ford pit
on the track. Witnesses to history. Shelby, exhilarated,
living through his friend. Muttering shift and brake
patterns... Hands fluttering the movements.
A YOUNG FORD EXEC approaches Beebe urgently. He holds a Le
Mans Rule Book. Whispers.
YOUNG FORD EXEC
Sir, It won’t be a tie. It can’t be.
Miles can’t get a tie if he crosses
near McLaren. McLaren started further
back at the pole. So if he’s anywhere
near Miles, McLaren wins 1st.
Interesting.

BEEBE
IN HIS GT
Miles closes his eyes a moment. Apotheosis. Top of the
mountain. He exhales. Centered within himself. At peace.
Spinning through space and time. Beyond the reach of each.
From this perfection... Miles eases off the throttle.
THE BIG NUMBER ONE GT 40 SLOWS DOWN.
Dots grow in Miles' rear view. Miles starts to be overtaken.
IN THE GRANDSTAND
The grandstand can't believe it. Some realize why.
A few boos aimed at the Ford Box.
IN HIS GT.

MILES glances in his rear-view. The other GT40's are coming.
McLaren in his silver and black GT 40, Bucknam in number 5.
IN THE PITS
Beebe watches, eyes bright. Shelby approaches him.
SHELBY
Sorry Leo, were you saying something
to me?
Beebe betrays nothing.

PETER
No dad! No...
Mollie watches the screen.
MOLLIE
It’s OK Petey. Look! Your Dad’s
bringing them in. He’s bringing them
all in together.

The cars line up along side each other. Miles in the centre.
IN HOLLYWOOD
Mollie gets it. She smiles. Tears fill her eyes.
MOLLIE
Good for you Ken.
IN THE STANDS..
Fans realize what Miles is doing. Some boo. The Ford
executives watch. Some removing their hats.
ON THE TRACK
Three cars head toward the line. Side by side. The drivers
can see each other. Exhausted. Jubilant. Victorious together.

Peter watches the Ford team roll to victory. His father in

The reporters go wild. Everybody goes wild -HENRY FORD II
Just beautiful. Look at that!
The crowd erupts AS THE THREE FORDS take the flag together..
IN THE PITS
Charlie argues with a French official then spins and crosses,
struggling to explain to Shelby...
CHARLIE
They’re saying it's not a tie! McLaren
started further back! He's travelled
further. They say he won, not Ken.
Shelby turns white. He rushes towards Beebe. REMINGTON spots
it straight away. Takes off after him. Shelby spins Beebe
around. Lifts him off the ground.
SHELBY
Where's the goddamn tie!? Did you
know! Didn't you? You knew!
Easy Shel-

REMINGTON

It takes Remington and Charlie and two others to hold Shelby
back. Or they know he's going to kill Beebe.
SHELBY
You knew, you bastard!
Beebe steps back.
SHELBY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Get out of my pit lane. You don't
belong here..
BEEBE
Shelby, honestly, I had no idea I
swearSHELBY
Get out of my goddamn pit!
Beebe turns and walks away.
OUT ON THE TRACK
THE CROWDS SWARM THE CARS -- The drivers get out and embrace
each other in front of the grandstand. They are exhausted.

Mollie watches the television. Peter by her side.
PETER
He lost? Wait Dad lost the race?
MOLLIE
Your dad's fine, my darling.
OUT ON THE TRACK
In the chaos, Remington approaches Miles. Quietly.
REMINGTON
They boned you Ken.
Ken takes off his helmet. He meets eyes with Shelby as he
hears the PA. Realizes he is second, not tied for first.
Miles looks into the service tunnel behind the pits. Sees
standing there the unmistakable figure of Enzo Ferrari.
The old man slowly raising his hand and lifts his hat.
A certain gesture. A salute. From one winner to another.
Ken Miles nods back. And watches the old man walk away.
ENZO
A great achievement.
He turns to Gozzi walking alongside.
ENZO (CONT'D) (cont’d)
But the finish. All three cars. Gives
me hope. They did not come to race.
They came to take pictures. Snap snap.
Like tourists, they come, take
pictures... and they go away.
Enzo gets into a waiting car.
ON THE TRACK. Miles being congratulated, but looks numb,
headed upstream, away from the fracas. His path will cross
with Leo Beebe, hurrying to the winner’s circle. Beebe sees
Miles, slows, apprehensive. Miles raises a hand, Beebe
flinches, and Miles pats him on the back.
MILES
Congratulations, Leo.
People try to get Shelby to the winner's circle. He flings
them aside. His focus is only for... Miles.

SHELBY
I never should've asked.
Miles smiles. Looks at his old friend.
Shelby nods. They both get it. Miles looks at Shelby. Total
truth. Totally no bullshit. Miles breathes. Free.
MILES
You promised me the drive, not the
win.
SHELBY
It was a hell of a drive.
MILES
She's a hell of a machine..
She's fast.

SHELBY

MILES
...could be faster.
They look at each other.
MILES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
The 7 litre’s sweet. But we still need
a lighter chassis. Was thinking bonded
aluminum. It's a ground up rebuild,
but if it works we can lose a couple
hundred pounds..
SHELBY
What are we standing around for?
MILES
Let me take a shower, have a cup of
tea..maybe a sandwich or something.
SHELBY
(laughs)
We'll get the bastards next year.
Nearby, on the podium, the Deuce, drivers, Ford Executives,
McLaren, Amon, all celebrating with champagne.
Miles puts an arm round Shelby as they join the crew in the
pits. Passers-by head toward the podium...
Shelby says something to Miles and he laughs.

HEAT HAZE ON BLACKTOP. CALIFORNIA.
Air shimmers. Gradually the shape of a man, stripped to the
waist, steps toward the outline of a new prototype white JCLASS FORD GT. Ken Miles stretches before pulling on his
helmet and gloves. Looks to Remington on a nearby rail.
MILES
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.
REMINGTON
‘What’ya you think of those honeycomb
panels. ‘what you were looking for?
MILES
Don’t know yet.
Ken zips up and gets in the car. A gloved thumb signals OK,
flicks the fuel pump switches and pushes a red START button.
It's taut engine coughs into a throaty dragons roar. Blue and
red fire crackles from the exhausts.
WE ARE : EXT. RIVERSIDE RACEWAY. DAY
MILES cruises around the track. Remington joins Peter
watching from the bleachers.
PETER
...She looks pretty good.
REMINGTON
She does, Pete. Lotta cooks in the
kitchen now. But I’m sure your pop
will have something smart to say.
INT. 1966 FORD J-CAR PROTOTYPE. DAY
MILES throws the gearbox into first and a foot hits the gas.
The beast twitches and squirrels as it's fat back tires bite,
accelerating hard... up through the gears, onto the track.
MILES throws the machine into the corner. A huge engine
blaring right behind his head.
SHELBY (V.O.)
There's a point at 7000RPM where
everything fades. The machine becomes
weightless. It disappears.
The SPEEDO: 150mph...160...

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

137.

SHELBY (V.O.)
All that's left is a body moving
through space, and time.
Hard on the brakes again. Rubber shards peeling onto the side
of the road as the car corners, on the edge of grip.
SHELBY (V.O.)
At 7000 RPM, That's where you meet it.
That's where it waits for you.. Out
there among the ghosts.
Then off the brakes and hard onto the accelerator:
... 170... 185mph. The vehicle laps the track surfing the
limit of what driver and the machine are capable of.
SHELBY (V.O.)
It creeps up on you, close in your
ear, and it asks you a question.
KEN MILES DRIVES. Focused. At the very extremity of physics
and skill... grace ...balance. Fulfilled. All sound fades
except the wind and a ticking clock. Sees his son in the
bleachers as he comes round.
SHELBY (V.O.)
The only question that matters..
The car bursts out of a corner howling onto the back
stretch... speedo flickering above 175mph...180....190...the
world motionless but in motion.
THEN : KEN MILES HEARS the tiniest of clicks and glances at
the gear lever vibrating oddly from side to side.
SHELBY
Three small words...
THREE QUICK CUTS : Smith stands off the rail. Shelby emerges
from the airstream. Peter and Remington stand.
IN THE CAR : Miles pumps the brake. Nothing. Looks up. Calm.
SHELBY (V.O.)
"Who are you"?
FROM PETER’S POV -- The distant sound of tires locking. Metal
twisting. Smoke rises on the horizon.
INT. SHELBY AMERICAN HANGER -- DAY
SHELBY stands, watching, numb as-- A NEW GT40 COMES TO A STOP
ON THE TARMAC. Dan Gurney emerges.

CREW MEMBER
What do you think, Dan?
GURNEY
She’s fantastic! No vibration in the
box. Smooth as silk.
The crew pats each other on the back.
SHELBY
(scowls)
You drove it for less than an hour...
(walks off)
‘don’t know shit after an hour.
Shelby crosses to his office, past REMINGTON and CUSTOMERS.
REMINGTON
...we’ve widened the fenders and
lowered the ride height. She puts out
425 horse and gets you from zero to
sixty in 4.3 seconds. You should just
be careful with that cause the
throttles’ a tad sensitive.
(Customer says something and then:)
Well, they go for $7500, Bryce, but if
you're taking two, and paying cash,
well, I think I can talk Shel into
seven even. That'd be 14 all in...
Hey, Shel.
INT. SHELBY’S OFFICE -- SAME
Shelby moves to his desk, glancing at the wood wedge that Ken
Miles once left there.
REMINGTON
(enters)
Shel. That guy, the one in the hat,
he’s ready to close on two 427’s, full
freight. His and hers. They flew in
from Galveston.
Uh huh.

SHELBY

REMINGTON
I just need you to maybe come out for
a minute.
Shelby holds the wooden wedge in his palm.

139.

Final Shooting Draft 04.24.19

And do what.

SHELBY

REMINGTON
Be Carroll Shelby. Tell them a story.
Spin a few magic words.
SHELBY
What does that mean?
REMINGTON
It means come out and say hello and
make them feel good. About their
purchase.
SHELBY
That’s your job.
Shel--

REMINGTON

SHELBY
--They’re getting the damned cars.
That’s what they get for their money.
Either they want them or they don’t.
You think I’m some kind of a lounge
act?!
No.

REMINGTON

SHELBY
You think I’m here to talk people into
things!?
Shelby hurls the wedge across the room.
Remington glances at the framed wrench on the wall. Shelby
follows his eyes to the same place.
REMINGTON
It’s been six months, Shel.
(walks out)
Sometimes they don’t get out of the
car.
CUT TO:
EXT. MILES’ OLD GARAGE. MORNING.
Shelby’s Cobra pulls up. He gets out and rounds the corner
toward -- The Miles house a half block away. As he
approaches, his footsteps slow because--

The front door opens. Mollie emerges with a coffee, picks up
the newspaper. As she heads back inside, she calls out-MOLLIE
Petey! Take out the garbage please!
The door shuts behind her. Shelby sighs. He crosses back to
his car opens the door :
PETER (O.S.)
Hello, Mr. Shelby.
Shelby spins round to find Peter straddling his bicycle.
Hello Pete.

SHELBY
Peter stares at the wrench in Shelby’s hand.
PETER
..I remember that wrench. My Dad threw
it at you.
SHELBY
I believe he did.
Why.

PETER
SHELBY
I think I had some words with him.
Called him a few names.
PETER
(smiles)
That’s right.
SHELBY
(shifts)
...I came to say hello to your Momma
this morning. Check in on her. But
then, all of a sudden, I started
thinking that sometimes words are not
very... useful.
Shelby hands Peter the wrench.
SHELBY (cont’d)
..Tools are useful. You can make
things with ‘em. ..Fix things with
‘em.

PETER
(looks at the wrench)
...Thanks.
SHELBY
I.. uh... You know, your Dad...
PETER
(lets him off the hook)
...He was your friend.
SHELBY
(a breath)
...Yessir. Yes. He was that. And he
thought you was finer than frog fur.
Peter smiles.
Peter!

MOLLIE (O.S.)
PETER
...I gotta go help my Mom.
SHELBY
Okay. You do that.
Peter rides off. And Shelby meets eyes with Mollie, waiting
for her son on the front step. He tips his hat. She nods.
INT. SHELBY’S COBRA. MILES GARAGE. DAY. MOMENTS LATER.
Shelby sits in his car.
Struggles with a halting breath, unable or not wanting to
push the feeling down. He lets out a sigh. Takes a pill from
a bottle. Pops it. Then he reaches for the keys. The engine
burbles to life.
Shelby sits back. Listens to the heartbeat of the cylinders.
Then... he pulls out. Hard and fast.
