INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY

2

A dank semi-basement apartment. KI-WOO, 24, runs from corner
to corner searching desperately for a Wi-Fi signal. Various
networks pop up, but they’re all password-protected.
KI-WOO
NO. Not you too “iptime.”
Ki-Jung! Upstairs neighbor
finally locked up his Wi-Fi.
ADJACENT ROOM -Lying on the floor of the narrow room, KI-JUNG, 23, barely
moves her lips -- ‘Fuck.’
KI-JUNG
Try ‘123456789.’ Then try it
backwards.
No luck.

KI-WOO

ANOTHER ROOM -Also lying on the floor, CHUNG-SOOK, 49, the mother, scoffs at
their collective misery.
CHUNG-SOOK
What am I supposed to do if
someone calls me? What if it’s a
job? Hey, Ki-Tek!
She kicks KI-TEK, 49, who is sleeping at her feet.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
I know you’re awake, asshole.
Care to comment?
KI-TEK
(wiping his drool)
What?

2.
CHUNG-SOOK
Our phones have been suspended for
weeks, and now the neighbors have
shut us out. What’s your plan?
She kicks him again.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
What are you going to do about it?
What’s the plan, genius?
She treats Ki-Tek like shit, but it doesn’t bother him. He
rises with the most serene, enlightened smile, then plods over
to the -LIVING ROOM SLASH KITCHEN
Where he removes a bag of white bread from the sad, empty
fridge. The bread is nearly gone too. Only the ends remain.
Ki-Tek takes a piece and picks off the moldy parts.
on the bread as he watches his son’s Wi-Fi dance.

He chews

KI-TEK
Son, if one seeks Wi-Fi-He raises his hand high.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
One must reach into the heavens.
Up.
KI-WOO
Yes, Father.
Ki-Woo raises the phone high as he heads into the -BATHROOM
The bathroom is long and narrow and has a raised ‘altar’ at the
far end where the toilet sits. The odd placement is
necessitated by the semi-basement’s lower position in relation
to the septic tank.
Ki-Woo walks in and climbs onto the toilet seat.
to fish for a signal when -BOOYAH!

He continues

KI-WOO (CONT’D)

KI-JUNG (O.S.)
You got it?
Ki-Jung barges in and walks over with her phone held up.

3.
KI-WOO
You see it? “coffeenara_2G”. I
guess it’s a new coffee joint.
Must be nearby.
KI-JUNG
I’m not getting shit.
KI-WOO
Get up closer.
Ki-Jung climbs onto the altar and squeezes next to Ki-Woo. The
siblings look ridiculous. Head touching the ceiling. Huddled
on top of the toilet seat.
Chung-Sook pops in.
CHUNG-SOOK
No text from Pizza Time? 2,000
more boxes and it’s payday.

INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LATER

3

The family sits among piles of UNASSEMBLED PIZZA BOXES and
folds them in silence. The crunch of cardboard is the only
sound as the cheap Pizza Time logo comes in and goes out of the
foreground.
They hear a truck rattling closer. Through the window, they
see a STREET FUMIGATION TRUCK spewing gas as it passes by. The
fog rolls closer to the window.
KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Woo)
Close the window.
KI-TEK
Leave it. Free fumigation.
rid of the damn crickets.

Get

Ki-Woo, who was about to close the window, sits back down.
The FOG quickly envelops the family as they continue to fold.
It’s rather poignant. A family braving through tear-inducing
fumes just to make a meager living.
CHUNG-SOOK
(gasps)
Shit!
KI-JUNG
(coughing)
I told you to close it!
Fuck me.

CHUNG-SOOK

Ki-Tek continues folding despite his red, bulging face.
desperately holds back his cough.

He

Ki-Woo goes to the bathroom and returns moments later with his
phone. He shows the family a GIF he downloaded.
KI-WOO
Watch. If we all fold like this
girl, we might even get paid
today.
The GIF shows “The World’s Fastest Pizza Box Folder,” a WHITE
GIRL with dazzling box-folding skills. She’s fast.
The family watches in awe. Inspired by the clip, they start
folding with renewed vigor.
Ki-Tek also picks up speed, but he lacks the dexterity of the
others. He’s getting more and more sloppy.

INT/EXT. SEMI-BASEMENT - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

4

Through the half-open door, we see the female PIZZA SHOP OWNER
standing outside the entrance. Quirky appearance. Pizza Time
T-shirt.
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Look at this for example. This
shitty folding job here.
The Owner shows Chung-Sook a botched corner.
PIZZA SHOP OWNER (CONT’D)
One out of four. One-fourth of
the boxes are unusable.
One out of four?

The family all look at Ki-Tek.

He just smiles.

Innocent as ever.

CHUNG-SOOK
(sighs)
Still, you can’t cut ten percent
from my pay. That’s too much.
LATER -Ki-Woo helps a MAN load boxes into a van.
Ki-Tek looks out from the apartment window, watching Chung-Sook
squabble with the Pizza Shop Owner.
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
I should pay even less considering
the number of botched boxes.

5.
CHUNG-SOOK
We were barely making anything to
begin with.
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Look. It’s not that simple. Each
ruined box exponentially tarnishes
our brand’s image.
CHUNG-SOOK
Your “brand”? You only have two
stores in Seoul. Fuck this-PIZZA SHOP OWNER
What did you say?
Ki-Woo quickly steps in, diffusing the situation with an easy
smile.
KI-WOO
It’s that kid, isn’t it?
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
What are you talking about?
KI-WOO
The part-timer at your shop. He
went MIA, didn’t he? During such
a crucial time too. You have a
large group order from The Love of
Christ Church. That’s why you and
your husband are out here working
your bottoms off.
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
How do you know that? Who told
you?
KI-WOO
That kid, he’s my friend.
KI-JUNG
Totally unreliable.
stellar reputation.

Not-so-

KI-WOO
I understand you’re upset. Ten
percent? Fine, we accept. That’s
completely within your authority.
However-PIZZA SHOP OWNER
However what?
KI-WOO
Would you consider hiring a new
employee?

KI-JUNG
Fire the loser who bailed on you.
The Owner just stares at the smiling siblings.
are these people?

What the hell

KI-WOO
I can come in for an interview
tomorrow. What would be a good
time for you?
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Wait. Hold on. I need to think
about this-The Owner senses a trap and tries to get out of it. She takes
out a few bills from her fanny pack and starts counting one by
one.
The family all stare.

It’s been a while since they’ve seen

INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

5

The ‘master bedroom’ next to the entrance. Wall adorned with
pictures of a young Chung-Sook competing at a national track
and field championship as a student athlete. A SHOT PUTTER.
Great upper body glimpsed through tight uniform. No pictures
of Ki-Tek.
Early evening. It’s darker. The four family members are
gathered around a table filled with various store-bought foods.
KI-TEK
What a special occasion. The four
of us gathered here to celebrate
the partial reactivation of our
phones as well as our son’s
upcoming job interview with a
national franchise.
Ki-Tek tries to deliver a heartfelt speech like a TV patriarch
but severely lacks the gravitas. Chung-Sook and Ki-Jung are
already drinking their beers.
Cheers!

KI-WOO

KI-TEK
To family!
(re: window)
That son of a bitch.

It’s not

7.
The family turns to see -A DRUNK MAN teetering toward the semi-basement window.
Their faces slowly fill with dread.
CHUNG-SOOK
How many times did I tell you? We
need to put up a “No Urinating”
sign.
KI-TEK
It’ll make them want to do it even
more. It’s psychology.
KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Woo)
Go yell at him or something!
KI-WOO
It’s not the right timing-The Drunk Man hasn’t unzipped his pants, still hovering
uncertainly in the dark corner.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
(hesitates)
I need to catch him in the act.
CHUNG-SOOK
Isn’t it fucking obvious?
kick him out!

Just

KI-JUNG
(to herself)
I hate this place.
Ki-Woo gets up, still unsure, when -VOICE (O.S.)
HEY, MISTER!
A VOICE booms from afar. Behind the Drunk Man, we see a
handsome, well-built young man climbing off a fancy scooter.
This is MIN-HYUK, 24. He walks over with a LARGE BOX in his
hands.
KI-JUNG
Is that Min-Hyuk?
It is.

CHUNG-SOOK

Ki-Woo is surprised to see Min-Hyuk, who continues to yell at
the would-be public urinater.

8.
MIN-HYUK
What do you think you’re doing?
You think this is a public toilet?
I, uh--

DRUNK MAN

MIN-HYUK
What are you looking at!
Cowed by Min-Hyuk’s presence, the Drunk Man quickly skedaddles
away.
Ki-Tek taps Ki-Woo on the shoulder.
KI-TEK
Your friend has mucho cajones.
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s that college student glow.
Look at that confidence.
KI-JUNG
Which Ki-Woo obviously doesn’t
have.
A smitten Ki-Jung admires Min-Hyuk as he walks over to the
apartment. He enters.
MIN-HYUK
How are you, Mr. and Mrs. Kim!
Min-Hyuk!

KI-TEK
Good to see you, son!

KI-WOO
What’s with the surprise
appearance?
MIN-HYUK
I texted you.
(to Ki-Jung)
Hey, Ki-Jung.
Ki-Jung smiles shyly as she nods.
Ki-Woo searches through his text messages.
KI-WOO
We could have met somewhere else.
You didn’t have to come all this
way.
MIN-HYUK
I brought this.

9.
Min-Hyuk shows Ki-Woo the box.
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
It’s heavy so I had to bring it on
my bike.
KI-JUNG
What’s this?
Ki-Jung lifts the flap to see a UNIQUELY SHAPED STONE and a
wooden display stand inside.
MIN-HYUK
(to Ki-Tek)
When I told my grandfather I was
going to see Ki-Woo, he gave me
this.
Whoa.

KI-TEK

Ki-Tek picks up the large stone.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
This is a precious viewing stone.
Is this an abstract specimen?
MIN-HYUK
You know your stones, Mr. Kim.
Pop-Pop’s been collecting viewing
stones since his academy days.
Our house is literally filled with
these things -- living room,
study, basement... This one is
supposed to bring luck. And
money.
KI-WOO
How perfect for us.

Symbolic.

KI-TEK
Yes, how serendipitous. Please
send him our sincere regards.
CHUNG-SOOK

He should’ve brought food.
Ki-Jung stabs Chung-Sook with her finger.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STORE - NIGHT

6

Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo sit at a portable table outside the store,
drinking soju and chasing it with chips. Min-Hyuk’s expensive
foreign scooter is parked behind him. It visually clashes with
the old grocery store and run-down alley.
MIN-HYUK
I had to bring that stupid rock,
but it was nice to see your folks.
They look good.
KI-WOO
They’re not as good as they look.
They’re all jobless.
MIN-HYUK
Ki-Jung’s at home too? She
doesn’t take college prep classes?
KI-WOO
It’s not that she doesn’t want to.
She can’t.
Ki-Woo downs a shot of soju.
Min-Hyuk looks at Ki-Woo. He has something to say.
out his phone and shows Ki-Woo -A picture of a brightly smiling TEENAGE GIRL.
uniform. Innocent.
MIN-HYUK
Cute, right?
KI-WOO
Is that her? The girl you’re
tutoring?
Min-Hyuk nods.
MIN-HYUK
Park Da-Hae. A sophomore. I want
you to tutor her. Take over for
me as her English teacher.
KI-WOO
That makes no sense.
MIN-HYUK
Her family’s loaded.

The gig pays

He takes

High school

11.
That gets Ki-Woo’s attention.

He looks at the picture again.

MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
She’s a good kid. I want you to
look after her until I come back
from the study-abroad program.
KI-WOO
You have plenty of friends at
school. Why do you want a highschool grad to teach your prized
student?
MIN-HYUK
Why do you think? I shudder just
thinking about those femalestarved engineering students
drooling around her like hungry
wolves. It’s revolting.
Ki-Woo studies Min-Hyuk.
KI-WOO
(laughs)
You like her, don’t you?
MIN-HYUK
(nods)
I’m serious about her. I’m going
to ask her out in two years, once
she’s in college. I want you to
take care of her while I’m gone.
I trust you.
KI-WOO
I appreciate the trust, but you
want me to pretend I’m a college
student?
MIN-HYUK
Ki-Woo, think about it. How many
times have you taken the college
entrance exam? Twice before your
military service and twice after
-- a grand total of four times.
Grammar, vocabulary, composition,
speaking. You’re an English
master. Far more qualified as a
tutor than I am. Better than
those spoiled college brats who
drown their brain cells in booze
everyday.
KI-WOO
That may be true but-- You think
the family would accept me? I’m
not even a college student.

12.
MIN-HYUK
We’ll embellish a little. You’ll
be fine. You’ll have my
recommendation. And the mother is
a bit-Min-Hyuk picks up his glass to drink when he suddenly becomes
thoughtful. He smiles.
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
She’s simple. Young. And simple.
KI-WOO
(English)
Simple? What do you mean?
MIN-HYUK
(English)
I don’t know. Just simple.
Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo start conversing in English for no reason.
They’re fluent.
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
I hear Ki-Jung is handy with
Photoshop.

INT. INTERNET CAFÉ - DAY

7

Ki-Jung is working at the computer, clicking the mouse and
tapping various keyboard shortcuts with dizzying speed. She’s
like a magician. On the monitor is a document -“Certificate of Enrollment.”
With laser focus, Ki-Jung refines the edges of the red
certification seal.
KI-WOO
This is amazing. How come you
keep failing the art school exam?
KI-JUNG
Shut up, dickwad.
The siblings work discreetly in the corner of the large
internet café.
KI-WOO
Take your time.
(looking around)
We should hold off on the printing
until the place clears out.

INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY

Ki-Tek is on the floor laying his head on the viewing stone.
He admires the freshly printed enrollment certificate.
KI-TEK
Look at this. There should be a
major for document forgery at
Seoul National University. KiJung would be top of the class.
CHUNG-SOOK
Shut up and wish the boy good luck
for his interview.
My son--

KI-TEK

Ki-Tek sits up.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I’m so proud of you.
A slightly awkward and embarrassing moment.
Woo did nothing to be proud of.

They all know Ki-

Ki-Woo finishes touching up his hair in front of the mirror.
He picks up the fake certificate.
KI-WOO
I don’t consider this a crime.
No. Because I plan on going to
this school next year.
KI-TEK
That’s my son. Man with a plan.
KI-WOO
I’m just using some of their
administrative services in
advance.

EXT. RICH NEIGHBORHOOD - ROAD - DAY

9

A quiet road snaking up the hill of a wealthy neighborhood.
High walls. Not a pedestrian in sight. Except Ki-Woo, who
consults the map on his phone as he walks up the hill, backpack
strapped. He looks around. Walks faster.

14.
10

EXT. MANSION - GATE - DAY

10

Ki-Woo stands in front of the gate, which is at the top of a
steep stairway. He waits through the MELODIC DOORBELL until a
VOICE finally answers. The voice is middle-aged, female.
FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER)
Who is it?
KI-WOO
Mrs. Park? Hi, I’m Min-Hyuk’s
friend-FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER)
Oh, hello. Please come in.
CLANK.

The gate is unlocked, and Ki-Woo walks into --

A GORGEOUSLY MANICURED GARDEN LINED WITH MAJESTIC TREES
Ki-Woo stops midway and admires the trees, overcome with awe.
MUN-KWANG (O.S.)
Quite a view, isn’t it?
KI-WOO
Mrs. Park, pleasure to meet you.
MUN-KWANG
Oh, no. I’m the housekeeper.
Please follow me.
MUN-KWANG, 45, fashionable and poised enough to be mistaken for
the owner, leads Ki-Woo inside.
KI-WOO
Stunning garden.
MUN-KWANG
The inside is even more stunning.
11

INT. MANSION - DAY
Ki-Woo carefully follows Mun-Kwang inside. Indeed, the
interior is stunning. But not excessive. The furniture and
decorations are all tasteful.
MUN-KWANG
Do you know Namgoong Hyunja? The
famous Korean-French architect?
Ki-woo is blank.

15.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
This used to be his house. He
built it.
I see.

KI-WOO

MUN-KWANG
Now it’s just Da-Hae’s house.
Mun-Kwang stops just short of the fabulous living room
overlooking the garden, arriving at the equally fabulous and
spacious -KITCHEN / DINING ROOM
She seats Ki-Woo at the large wooden table.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Please wait here. I’ll get Mrs.
Park.
Mun-Kwang exits, and Ki-Woo is left alone in silence.
quietly gets up and looks around.

He

There’s some kind of AVANT-GARDE ART hanging on the wall. Next
to it, he sees a typical Korean FAMILY PORTRAIT taken at a
studio.
Ki-Woo walks over to the window, which overlooks the backyard.
He sees -A WOMAN dozing off at the patio table. English magazine open
on the table. Head tilted comically. Only her soft white neck
is visible. This is YON-KYO, 41.
Mun-Kwang walks over and CLAPS her hands loudly next to YonKyo’s ears.
Yon-Kyo sucks her drool in and slowly raises her head.

MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
The tutor is here.

I don’t know, but he’s handsome.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

12

Yon-Kyo sits with Ki-Woo at the dining table. She pulls out
the fake certificate halfway, glimpses at it, then puts it back
in.
Ki-Woo is nervous. Even the DOG, cradled in Yon-Kyo’s arms, is
watching him. Panting. Disapproving.
YON-KYO
I don’t care about papers. I only
wanted to see you because you were
recommended by Min-Hyuk. I guess
you two are good friends.
Ki-Woo listens quietly.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you know better than I
do, but Min-Hyuk is just the most
brilliant human being. I don’t
even care about the grades. DaHae and I absolutely adored him.
Do you know what I mean?
KI-WOO
Of course.
YON-KYO
We just loved him so much. I
wanted him to stay with Da-Hae
through her college exams next
year, but now he’s leaving to
study abroad and I’m suddenly left
without a tutor. I mean, what am
I supposed to do?
Ki-Woo listens, respectful.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Excuse my bluntness, but I just
don’t see the point of hiring
someone unless he’s as utterly
outstanding as Min-Hyuk, you know?
Mun-Kwang sneaks a glance at Ki-Woo as she brings coffee over
to the table, checking him out.
CLINK.

She sets it down loudly in front of Ki-Woo.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I guess what I wanted to ask was
-- Would it be okay if I sat in
for today’s class? I want to see
the whole thing. Judge for
myself. I would like to see your

Yon-Kyo and her dog are sitting on the

The attention doesn’t bother Ki-Woo, who is calmly focused on
DA-HAE as she works through a practice test.
KI-WOO
Are you sure about question 14?
DA-HAE
(hesitant)
Is it wrong?
KI-WOO
I’m asking you. What does your
gut say? Do you think number 14
is right?
Da-Hae shrinks.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
You were working on other
questions before you came back to
14. Am I right?
Yes.

DA-HAE

Ki-Woo suddenly snatches Da-Hae’s wrist, shocking both Da-Hae
and her mom. He presses his thumb gently and feels her pulse
like doctor.

18.
KI-WOO
If this was a real test and number
14 was the first question, you
would’ve been in trouble from the
start.
He presses harder.

See? You pulse is irregular.
Your heart doesn’t lie.
Da-Hae turns bright red.

Yon-Kyo is speechless, either

KI-WOO (CONT’D)
What are you supposed to do in a
test? You move forward. You need
to seize the flow. The rhythm.
If not, you’re screwed. I don’t
care about question number 14. I
only care about how you seize the
flow. How you conquer the test as
a whole. You get it?
Da-Hae is quiet.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
A test is all about confidence.
(English)
Attitude.
Stunned silence. Ki-Woo finally lets go of Da-Hae’s wrist,
revealing a round, pink spot where he held her.
Ki-Woo looks over at Yon-Kyo.

She’s completely floored.

KI-WOO (CONT’D)
I know. You were angry.
Frustrated. You worked so hard.

your test scores weren’t

CLOSE ON a thick money envelope being handed to Ki-Woo.
YON-KYO
I’ll pay you each month on this
day. As for the lesson, I was
thinking three times a week?
Monday, Wednesday, Friday?
KI-WOO
That sounds good.
YON-KYO
It’s a little more than what MinHyuk used to get. Cost of living
and so forth.
KI-WOO
Thank you.
As Ki-Woo puts away the envelope, Mun-Kwang brings over a fruit
plate. She’s noticeably friendlier than before.
YON-KYO
(to Mun-Kwang)
I guess it’s time to get to know
each other. Mr. Kevin will be DaHae’s English teacher.
MUN-KWANG
Of course! Mr. Kevin, you let me
know if you need anything at all
during your lessons -- snacks,
drinks, whatever.
KI-WOO
I appreciate it.
YON-KYO
Feel free to pester her if you
need anything in this house.
She’s the expert. She knows it
better than I do.
They continue exchanging pleasantries when -THUNK. A PLASTIC ARROW flies in and hits Mun-Kwang’s shoulder.
When Ki-Woo looks over -It’s a boy in a Native American costume about to shoot another
arrow. This is DA-SONG, 10, the youngest Park.

Da-Song! Behave yourself.

YON-KYO
(sighs)
I apologize. Our son is a little
--unique.
KI-WOO
Unique is good.
YON-KYO
He has trouble focusing. ADHD.
We signed him up for the Cub
Scouts hoping the discipline would
help, but he’s become an even
bigger weirdo. Now he’s obsessed
with Indians-KI-WOO
(laughs)
The Scouts have roots in American
Indian culture, so he has the
right idea.
YON-KYO
You were a Scout too?
KI-WOO
Yes, I learned a lot as a Scout.
YON-KYO
Look how fine you turned out.
What’s wrong with him?
(then, serious)
He’s actually an art prodigy, you
know. Did you see the drawings?

Those are his.

YON-KYO
Right? Strong. I knew you would
get it, Mr. Kevin.
Ki-Woo takes a couple of steps back and admires the drawings
with a serious face.
KI-WOO
I see. It’s an interpretation of
a chimpanzee.
YON-KYO
It’s a self-portrait.
Awkward. Crickets chirp as Da-Song and Mun-Kwang continue to
battle it out in the background.
KI-WOO
Of course. Us grown-ups are too
jaded to see true genius.

EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - EVENING
YON-KYO
That must be why. We’ve gone
through dozens of art teachers.
They never last more than a month.
Of course Da-Song is a bit much to

Ki-Woo nods.
Yon-Kyo has come to see him out with the dog in her arms.
The gate opens.

Ki-Woo begins to step out when he stops.

KI-WOO
Actually... Mrs. Park.
Yes?

YON-KYO

KI-WOO
Someone just happened to come to
my mind. Her name is--

Through Yon-Kyo’s POV, we see the back of Ki-Woo’s head as he
seemingly tries to remember.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Girl’s Generation. The girl
group. What was her name -- the
one who started the jewelry brand?
Jessica?

YON-KYO

KI-WOO
Right! Jessica. My cousin has a
school friend named Jessica. I
don’t know her Korean name. She
studied applied arts at Illinois
State and recently moved back to
Korea.
YON-KYO
Ah, Illinois State.
her?

What about

KI-WOO
She also tutors, and she’s known
to have a very unique approach to
teaching art. Most of all, she
knows how to handle kids.
YON-KYO
(interested)
Is that so?
KI-WOO
She’s a bit of a celebrity in
tutoring circles. Her style is a
little unorthodox, but it still
gets kids into good art schools.
YON-KYO
She sounds fantastic.

I’m so

KI-WOO
Would you be interested in meeting
her? She’s very busy so I’m not
sure if I’ll be able to get an

Why Jessica. So tacky.

Ki-Jung is getting her hair done at the neighborhood shop.
Ki-Woo is sucking on a popsicle on the sofa behind her.
KI-WOO
It has a nice ring. Anyhow.
She’s a nice lady. Young. Not
the brightest tool in the shed.
The money is good, and most of
all, she’s a ‘believer.’
CHUNG-SOOK
She’s religious?
TRACK BACK TO REVEAL -- Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek sitting next to
Ki-Jung, also getting their hairs trimmed.
KI-WOO
No, it’s just-- She tends to
trust people rather easily.
They become thoughtful.

Ki-Tek breaks the silence.

KI-TEK
She sounds like a great lady.
Right?
Yeah.

The family members all nod.

A strange excitement appears on

EXT. MANSION - GATE - LATE AFTERNOON

18

Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung both take a deep breath in front of the
gate. Ki-Jung looks like a completely new person with short,
stylish hair and makeup.
Ki-Woo is about to ring the doorbell when Ki-Jung stops him.
She suddenly starts clapping a beat with her hands.
KI-JUNG
(singing)
Jessica, only child, Chicago
Illinois / My classmate Jin-Mo is
cousin of Kevin
She sings her ‘bio’ to the tune of a catchy Korean oldie.
Woo joins. Silly. Ridiculous. But you can sense a real
sibling bond.

Finally Ki-Woo presses the button, and the DOORBELL rings
throughout the quiet neighborhood.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EVENING

We find Da-Song at the bottom of the stairs peeking inside the
kitchen where -Yon-Kyo is interviewing Ki-Jung. They talk quietly.
Serious. Ki-Woo sits a few feet away.

Formal.

Da-Hae tiptoes down from second floor and sees Da-Song peeking.
She flicks his forehead and sends him upstairs.
She then looks inside the kitchen herself.
Jung, scrutinizing, suspicious.

She focuses on Ki-

KI-WOO
I should go upstairs for my
lesson. I’ll let you two talk.
(to Ki-Jung)
Jessica, nice meeting you.
Ki-Woo gets up and nods to Ki-Jung.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
I’ll see you next time.
Ki-Jung also stands up, cordial.
KI-JUNG
Thank you, Kevin.
Da-Hae sees Ki-Woo coming and runs back up the stairs.

INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - EVENING
Da-Hae hurries back to her desk and pretends to work on her
problems.
The door opens, and Ki-Woo enters.
KI-WOO
Where did we leave off?

He sits next to Da-Hae.

DA-HAE
You know-KI-WOO
What is it?
DA-HAE
You know it’s all an act, right?
My brother.

25.
KI-WOO
What are you talking about?
DA-HAE
It’s all fake. Acting all
bizarro. Like he’s a crazed
artist. He’s a big fraud.
Da-Song?

KI-WOO

DA-HAE
You know, like he would stop in
the middle of the street and
pretend he was struck by a sudden
inspiration.
KI-WOO
(laughs)
Randomly stare up at the clouds
and ponder the shapes? Something
like that?
DA-HAE
Exactly! He’s the worst! And he
acts like he can’t behave normal.
Like he’s completely perplexed.
Makes me want to puke.
KI-WOO
So Da-Song is a fraud. What does
that have to do with your English
problems?
Dae-Hae pouts when Ki-Woo suddenly returns to tutor mode.
DA-HAE
I’m just saying.
KI-WOO
Good. Now those were all great
descriptions of Da-Song. Why
don’t we use them to compose a
paragraph in English? You must
use the word ‘pretend’ at least
twice.
Ki-Woo, master tutor, skillfully guides the conversation back
to the lesson.
But Da-Hae still has something on her mind.

DA-HAE
Can I ask you something?

She puts down her

What now?

KI-WOO

DA-HAE
The teacher downstairs. Ms.
Jessica. Is she really your
cousin’s friend?
This catches Ki-Woo off guard.

He disguises it with a smile.

KI-WOO
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
DA-HAE
She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she?
Ki-Woo relaxes and laughs. He looks at Da-Hae, who is all
worried and serious. She’s cute.
Come on.

KI-WOO
I just met her today.

DA-HAE
(pouting)
She’s very pretty.

Not even

KI-WOO
She is pretty. A beauty even.
DA-HAE
I knew it. You are interested.
KI-WOO
If you were a perfect ten, maybe
she would be a six? Six-pointfive?
A cheesy line, but Da-Hae smiles, pleased. Suddenly, she grabs
Ki-Woo’s wrist under the desk. She presses it gently, feeling
his pulse. A bold, unexpected move on her part.
Ki-Woo stares quietly at Da-Hae. Slowly, they grow closer.
Lips converge. A soft, gentle kiss held through silence until
-They hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Let’s study.
Right.

DA-HAE

INT. MANSION - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - EVENING

Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung pass Da-Hae’s room and walk toward DaSong’s. Yon-Kyo turns to Ki-Jung, nervous.
YON-KYO
I should tell you. He’s not good
at staying in one place.
(apologetic)
I hope you understand-KI-JUNG
It’s fine.
Ki-Jung has no expression. Nothing fazes her. Yon-Kyo
hesitates before finally opening the door to reveal -DA-SONG’S ROOM
A huge clutter. Covered with Da-Song’s drawings as well as
pictures of Native American tribesmen. All kinds of Indianthemed toys. A TEEPEE TENT imported from America.
Da-Song is lying on the floor with a toy arrow tucked between
his legs. Staring at the ceiling. In his own world. This may
also be an act.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Would you mind leaving?
YON-KYO
Excuse me?
KI-JUNG
I don’t allow parents to sit in
during lessons.
Yon-Kyo is surprised.
stare is unwavering.

She continues to linger, but Ki-Jung’s

YON-KYO
I just thought, since it’s the
first day-- As you can see, the
boy is a bit-KI-JUNG
You should wait downstairs.
Yon-Kyo finally backs down, subdued by Ki-Jung’s authority.
She walks out of the room.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

22

TICK TOCK TICK TOCK.
Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang nibble on nuts as they pass time in the
kitchen. The dog licks Yon-Kyo’s face, which is full of agony,
worry, curiosity.
Mun-Kwang sees Yon-Kyo’s state -MUN-KWANG
Would you like some plum extract?
I can add some honey. It’ll help
you relax.
What?

YON-KYO
Oh. Sure.

Mun-Kwang walks down a narrow set of stairs to the -STORAGE BASEMENT
Stocked with all kinds of foods, beverages, and other household
necessities. On one side is a cabinet filled with numerous
GLASS JARS -- hand-extracted plum, tangerine, and fig
concentrates. Mun-Kwang picks up the plum bottle and twists
the tightly locked lid when -Yon-Kyo hurtles down the stairs.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I have an idea! This is what
we’ll do!
What?

MUN-KWANG

YON-KYO
You’ll take two plum juices to DaSong’s room. You’re not a parent
so you can go in. You’ll just be
delivering the drinks.
MUN-KWANG
You’re right. I’ll take a quick
peek and let you know how they’re
doing.
YON-KYO
Dammit. Why didn’t I think of
this before?
MOMENTS LATER --

29.
Mun-Kwang and Yon-Kyo hurry back up the steps with a cup of
plum extract. They are startled to see -Ki-Jung and Da-Song waiting in the kitchen, already done with
their lesson.
Yon-Kyo tries to hide her surprise.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
You guys are... done?
Ki-Jung is holding a picture drawn by Da-Song.
standing politely behind her.

Da-Song is

KI-JUNG
Mrs. Park, will you please have a
seat?
YON-KYO
(nervous)
Sure.
KI-JUNG
Da-Song, you go up.
Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang are stunned to see -Da-Song obediently bowing and heading up the stairs.

What?!

Ki-Jung hands Yon-Kyo the drawing.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Da-Song drew this today.
Yon-Kyo is scared.

She has no idea what’s going on.

Ki-Jung clocks Mun-Kwang peeking over Yon-Kyo’s shoulders.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I’d like to speak to you alone.
YON-KYO
Oh, this is-KI-JUNG
Can you please give us a moment?
Yon-Kyo’s voice falters at Ki-Jung’s ice-cold demeanor.
Mun-Kwang stares hard at Ki-Jung before walking away.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I mentioned earlier that I’m also
studying art therapy.

Yes, I remember--

She quickly covers her mouth.

Her hands

KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I feel a bit cautious about
bringing this up -- it’s the first
day after all -- but I’ll need to
know what happened to Da-Song in
order to truly understand him.
YON-KYO
When he was in first grade-(tearful)
I’m sorry. I don’t know if I can
talk about this right now.
KI-JUNG
It’s fine. We can talk about it
later.
Ki-Jung puts a finger on the drawing.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Here. This lower section is
what’s called the ‘schizophrenia
zone’ in psychology. It contains
clues about the mental state of
the child. Do you see this
particular shape drawn here?
Yes.

YON-KYO
Yes, I do.

Yon-Kyo suddenly looks up from the drawing and stares at the
large framed picture on the wall.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
My gosh! It’s in the other
drawing too! Same spot!
Ki-Jung looks back at the picture.
Yes.

KI-JUNG
Same spot, same pattern.

Yon-Kyo nods fervently.

She sobs harder.

She feels like a

YON-KYO
I see that picture everyday.
Every time I eat.
(sobs)
I had no idea.
KI-JUNG
You don’t have to beat yourself
up. These drawings are records of
Da-Song’s emotions. A black box
of his soul. I’d like to try and
unlock that box. But I’ll need
time.
YON-KYO
Of course. Please take as much
time as you need. I can wait.
KI-JUNG
(calm)
I suggest four two-hour sessions a
week -- Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday. This is different from
regular tutoring -- it’s art
therapy -- so I would need to be
compensated at a higher rate.
YON-KYO
Of course. I understand.
Ki-Jung continues her performance as multi-certified art
teacher and therapist Jessica when -We hear a car pull into the garage. Moments later, DONG-IK
PARK, 45, Yon-Kyo’s husband and Da-Song’s father, emerges from
the stairs next to the front entrance.
We notice the AUTOMATED MOTION-SENSOR LIGHTS blinking above the
main entrance as Dong-Ik walks in.
YUN, 31, the driver, follows up with Dong-Ik’s things.
Oh--

YON-KYO (CONT’D)

Yon-Kyo wipes her tears.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Dong-Ik. Say hi to Ms. Jessica,
Da-Song’s new art teacher. She
just started today.
(to Jessica; in English)
Jessica, this is Dong-Ik.
KI-JUNG
(curt)
Hello.

32.
Dong-Ik looks tired. But even the fatigue adds to his mystique
and cool as a high-flying CEO. He shares a brief handshake
with Ki-Jung.
DONG-IK
Thank you for helping Da-Song.
(to Yon-Kyo)
Are they done for the day?
YON-KYO
Yes, they just finished.
DONG-IK
(to Yun)
Sorry Yun, but are you busy
tonight? Would you mind taking
Ms. Jessica home? I don’t want
her walking down the hill alone at
night.

Ki-Jung sits quietly in the back. She looks quite natural in

Yun sneaks glances at Ki-Jung through the rearview mirror.

I’ll get off at Hyehwa.
Yun looks out the window.
YUN
It looks like it’s about to rain.
I bet the Mercedes is way better
than the subway--

KI-JUNG
(cutting him off)
No. I’m supposed to meet my
boyfriend at the station.
I see.

YUN

Yun’s smile disappears.

He quietly turns the steering wheel.

Ki-Jung stares at the back of Yun’s head, thinking.

Then --

She slowly reaches under her skirt and starts rolling down her
underwear!
Her eyes twinkle in the dark as she holds the removed underwear
in her hands.

INT. BUFFET RESTAURANT - DAY

KI-JUNG
Did you drive Benzes when you were
a designated driver?
KI-TEK
Not when I was at the designated
driver service. I drove a lot of
them when I was a valet.
KI-JUNG
When were you a valet?
CHUNG-SOOK
After the fried chicken and before
the Taiwanese Castella. About six
months, I’d say?
KI-TEK
Nah. It was after the Castella
shop went bust.
Ki-Tek and family stack food onto their already mountainous
plates as they move along the buffet line. They’re at a large
budget restaurant frequented by BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS.
Ki-Woo makes sure no one is listening before -KI-WOO
We’re already starting Phase
Three?
KI-JUNG
I planted a little trap in the
Mercedes. We’ll see if he bites.

34.
KI-WOO
Then it’s begun.
(looking around)
Father, how amazing is this? We
just so happen to be eating at a
buffet for drivers. How symbolic!
Ki-Tek doesn’t get it but beams anyway.
KI-TEK
This place IS amazing! You guys

CHUNG-SOOK
You’re not even buying, you big
bum. They are.
Ki-Tek is still happy.

He puts some of his meat on Ki-Woo’s plate.

KI-WOO
Thanks, Dad!
(to Ki-Jung)
By the way, what did you say to
Mrs. Park yesterday?
Why?

KI-JUNG

KI-WOO
She was over the moon about you.
Saying that you were a godsend. A
freaking miracle FedExed from
heaven.
KI-JUNG

I just googled ‘art therapy’ and
did a little improv, and she just
lost her shit. Started crying

Dong-Ik pulls out the panties from his pocket.
Yon-Kyo gasps, shocked.

Perhaps more outraged than necessary.

DONG-IK (CONT’D)
You pay him well, don’t you? He
doesn’t have money to go to a
hotel? Is he saving that money
for something?
YON-KYO
Maybe he’s a sexual deviant? He
might get off on doing it in his
boss’ car.
Yon-Kyo sees -- Dong-Ik is in no mood.

Her husband rarely gets this

Dong-Ik calms down and looks at the underwear.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)

You know what’s even weirder?
YON-KYO
(nervous)
What?
DONG-IK
Don’t you see? Think about it.
Yon-Kyo is freaked out of her mind.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
So they have sex in the car. It’s
not unusual to leave behind a few
strands of hair, maybe an earring.
But how do you forget your
underwear?
YON-KYO
It’s true. You don’t just forget
to put on your knickers.
DONG-IK
That’s why. I’m more concerned by
his -- partner. Her mental state.
Do you know what I mean?
Dong-Ik checks the surroundings before whispering something in
Yon-Kyo’s ear.
YON-KYO
NOOOO-(turning pale)
Like methamphetamine?
Shhhh!

Cocaine?

DONG-IK

YON-KYO
What do we do? If they find some
kind of white powder in your car,
we’re all doomed!

37.
DONG-IK
Calm down, babe. Relax. We don’t
want to go too far. Not yet. For
now it’s just a suspicion. A
well-founded one.
As the Parks continue to fret over the panties, CAMERA BOOMS UP
TO REVEAL -Ki-Jung standing on the stairs with her bag, listening to the
conversation.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
We can’t even take something like
this to the police. And it would
look ridiculous if I tried to
interrogate him. What would I
say? “Yun, did you have sexual
intercourse in my car?”
(then)
That’s why I was thinking-YON-KYO
Yes, dear.
DONG-IK
You have to take care of this.
Come up with some kind of bland,
harmless reason. Let him go
quietly. Don’t even mention the
panties. Or the intercourse.
YON-KYO
I understand. We don’t want the
neighborhood birds gossiping about
the Parks’ driver sexing up the
boss’ car.
DONG-IK
Exactly. Our names will forever
be linked with his disgusting
behavior.
Yon-Kyo nods, then thinks.
YON-KYO
You don’t think Yun would post
something online, do you? Go on a
Twitter vendetta? He could
announce to the whole world that
he was unfairly fired by a famous
tech CEO.

DONG-IK
We’ll pay him severance. Enough
to keep him quiet. Just choose
your words carefully when you let
him go. Then we’ll be fine.
Just then Ki-Jung starts walking down the stairs.

Ms. Jessica, I wanted to ask. The
other night, when Yun took you
home...
Yes?

KI-JUNG

YON-KYO
This may sound weird but-- Did
anything happen that night?
No.

KI-JUNG
I went straight home.

YON-KYO
Good, good.
(relieved)
That’s good to hear.
KI-JUNG
Such a nice man. I asked him to
drop me off at Hyehwa Station, but
he kept insisting that he would
take me home.
YON-KYO
(raising her voice)
So the bastard went to your house?
At night? He knows where you
live?
No.

KI-JUNG
I just got off at Hyehwa.

YON-KYO
(sighs)
Thank God. You did the right
thing.
(English)
Nice, Jessica.
KI-JUNG
Did something happen to him?
Yon-Kyo opens the gate.
YON-KYO
He, well-- He won’t be working
for us anymore. There was a bit
of an incident. You don’t need to
know the details.
KI-JUNG
That’s too bad. He seemed like a
nice man.
YON-KYO
You’re so precious, Ms. Jessica.
So innocent. You still have a lot
to learn about this world.
Ki-Jung stifles her laughter as she walks down the steps. She
sees Mun-Kwang walking back home with the Parks’ THREE DOGS in
the distance.
Yon-Kyo waves at them.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
(sighs)
We used to like him too. We were
excited to have a driver who was
young and hip.
KI-JUNG
I thought most people preferred
older drivers.
YON-KYO
Yes, it’s true. Older drivers
tend to drive more carefully.
They’re more sophisticated.
KI-JUNG
My uncle had a driver who was like
that. Mr. Kim. A real gentleman.
Such a kind man. We used to
follow him like an uncle.
Really?

YON-KYO

KI-JUNG
Yes. He was such a warm and
kindhearted person.
Unfortunately, my uncle was
transferred to Chicago and had to
let Mr. Kim go. I don’t know what
he’s doing these days-YON-KYO
I’m very interested in this
person, Ms. Jessica. Do you think
I could meet him? As you can see,
it’s becoming harder and harder
for me to trust people. I won’t
hire anyone unless they’re
recommended by people I
absolutely, positively trust. I
just have a feeling he could be a
great candidate since you grew up
with him and all.
Mun-Kwang walks within earshot and hears the conversation.

Would you like to meet him?

She’s been in the house the

She used to work for the previous

It’s a made job. Of course she
won’t just let go.
KI-JUNG
If we want to extract her, we’ll
need to do some prep work.
KI-WOO
That’s right. We need a plan.
Chung-Sook, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung are sitting at the corner
table. We notice the tacky Pizza Time logo everywhere.
The Pizza Shop Owner (from Scene 4) begrudgingly brings a
combination pizza over to the table. She hates that she has to
serve these losers.
CHUNG-SOOK
Hey, how about some more hot sauce
here?
The Owner picks up a hot sauce from the other table and drops
it in front of Chung-Sook.
Chung-Sook mouths ‘bitch’ as the Owner walks away.
Ki-Woo studies the hot sauce. He picks it up and squirts two
drops on a blank napkin, as if testing something.

Ki-Jung picks up a PEACH from the fruit section. She holds it
in the sunlight and carefully examines the soft fuzz
surrounding it.
KI-WOO (V.O.)
The housekeeper has a severe peach
allergy. If she even goes near a
peach, she’ll turn red and start
hyperventilating. Full-on asthma

her.

Using a sharp razor, Ki-Woo meticulously shaves off the fuzz

Ki-Woo walks out of the house after another lesson. He bows to

Yon-Kyo carries a bunch of shopping bags out of the department

Ki-Tek is waiting at the Mercedes. He opens the trunk and puts
Yon-Kyo’s bags in. When he’s done, he continues to linger. He
hesitates before taking out his phone.
KI-TEK
Mrs. Park. I, um, I didn’t know
if this was worth mentioning, but
I wanted to make sure.
He shows Yon-Kyo a photo on his phone.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)

SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC builds as Ki-Jung descends the stairs. When
she removes her hand from her pocket, we see that it’s covered
in soft PEACH FUZZ. The fuzz glistens in the afternoon
sunlight as Ki-Jung walks down to the -KITCHEN

Mun-Kwang comes over and hands her a glass. As Ki-Jung takes
the glass, she casually wipes the peach fuzz on Mun-Kwang’s

We see a text from Yon-Kyo on Ki-Tek’s phone -“2nd floor sauna.

Ki-Tek looks around before quietly treading up the stairs.

INT. MANSION - SAUNA - LATE AFTERNOON
A small, phone-booth-sized sauna situated at the end of the
hallway between the dressing room and bathroom.
As soon as Ki-Tek walks in, Yon-Kyo shuts the door and pulls
down the roller shades. They are now inches away from each
other in the tight space. Light seeps in from outside,
illuminating Yon-Kyo’s bloodshot eyes and smeared makeup.
YON-KYO
Mr. Kim, you have to promise you
won’t tell my husband.
KI-TEK
Of course.
YON-KYO
He can’t find out that I’ve been
keeping that walking lung disease
around the kids this whole time.
He’ll kill me.
KI-TEK
Don’t worry, Mrs. Park.

I don’t want to step out of line,
but I had a request as well. See,
I have nothing personal against

Mun-Kwang’s face gradually turns dark.

EXT. MANSION - ROAD - LATE EVENING

Mun-Kwang carries a large bag down the hill. Still in
disbelief. Devastated. Her hair dances wildly in the rough
wind. The sky is getting darker.
Mun-Kwang keeps looking back at the house as she walks away.
She stops and stares at the firmly closed gate for a long time.

INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - NIGHT
It’s raining outside.
DONG-IK
Mr. Kim, do you know a place where
I can get some good short ribs?
Somewhere not too far.
KI-TEK
Of course.

52.
Ki-Tek turns the wheel and switches lanes.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
You’ll be eating out tonight?
DONG-IK
Yes. I suddenly had a craving for
juicy short ribs. Since I can’t
have them at home now.
Ki-Tek makes an effortless U-turn across the large, eight-lane
road. The raindrops on the window swerve diagonally.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
(smiles)
Our housekeeper used to make the
best short ribs.
KI-TEK
You mean the lady who just quit
yesterday?
DONG-IK
She was with us for a long time.
I don’t know why she suddenly
left. Mrs. Park wouldn’t even
tell me. I mean, there’s no
shortage of housekeepers looking
for work so I guess we can just
hire another one. But it’s a real
pity. She was a great lady.
I see.

KI-TEK

DONG-IK
She took care of all the little
things in the house. And she was
a tremendous cook. Most
importantly, she never crossed the
line. If there’s one thing I
hate, it’s people who cross the
line. Well, I guess she did have
one flaw.
(laughs)
She was a big eater. Ate twice as
much as other people. But I
suppose she worked twice as hard
to make up for that.
KI-TEK
I guess Mrs. Park will need to
find a new housekeeper soon.

53.
DONG-IK
(nods)
Or the house will descend into
chaos. I guarantee she won’t be
able to survive a week without
one. Shambles, I tell you. My
clothes will start smelling-(laughs)
Mrs. Park definitely wins the
worst homemaker award. Doesn’t
know her way around a vacuum, and
her cooking is just -- abysmal!
But...
you?

KI-TEK
you still love her, don’t

Ki-Tek’s suddenly serious comment catches Dong-Ik off guard.
Silence. Then Dong-Ik starts laughing. Hard.
DONG-IK
Of course I love her! I don’t
know what else you’d call this.
KI-TEK
Then maybe you should look at
this-Ki-Tek removes a business card from his pocket and hands it to
Dong-Ik.
On beautiful ivory-colored stock, only the name, “The Care,” is
printed in elegant typography. No number. No address.
The Care?

DONG-IK
What is this?

KI-TEK
I just found out about them
recently too. It’s a membershipbased total care company.
Catering to families of VIP’s like
yourself. They provide maids, inhome caregivers, also drivers like
myself. From what I hear, they
select only the best. The most
experienced workers.
DONG-IK
Looks very nice.
Dong-Ik flips the card to the other side.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
The design is gorgeous. How did
you learn about this company, Mr.
Kim?

54.
KI-TEK
They called me about working for
them. I guess I’m one of the more
experienced drivers around, so
they wanted to recruit me. I
turned them down because I was
already scheduled to meet you.
DONG-IK
I see.
(nods)
Well, I’m honored that you chose
me over such a reputable company.
I am forever grateful, Mr. Kim!
Dong-Ik laughs.
KI-TEK
(laughs)
You’re being ridiculous, sir.
They’re laughing, but there’s a subtle underlying tension
between the two men. There’s still a ‘line’ that Dong-Ik won’t
cross. He suddenly drops his smile.
DONG-IK
Well, then. I guess I’ll just
give this to Mrs. Park.
KI-TEK
Yes, you should. But don’t say I
gave it to you.
(smiles)
You should tell her that you
looked it up yourself.
DONG-IK
(laughs)
Good idea! That’s sure to earn me
some points. Thank you, Mr. Kim.
KI-TEK
They’re membership-only, so I
don’t think they have a website or
anything. There’s a consultation

fruits in front of Da-Hae and Ki-Woo.
Yay!

DA-HAE
Peaches!

CHUNG-SOOK
Please have some too, Mr. Kevin.
KI-WOO
Thank you, ma’am.
Chung-Sook pinches Ki-Woo’s earlobe while Da-Hae is not
looking. Ki-Woo nearly jumps. Chung-Sook just smiles and
walks out of the room. We continue to follow her as she pads
down the hall and enters -DA-SONG’S ROOM
Where we see the TEEPEE in the corner. The flap opens and KiJung peeks out to see who it is. Da-Song is tightly cuddled up

food outside.

she hands over the plate. She looks around at the drawings in

YON-KYO
What’s all this stuff? We just

DONG-IK
These are different. Might as

Da-Song has already opened the walkie-talkie box. He also goes
through the other items -- CAMPFIRE SUPPLIES, AN AXE FOR
CHOPPING FIREWOOD...
As Ki-Tek walks out, he quickly feels up Chung-Sook’s behind.
Chung-Sook giggles to herself as she goes to the kitchen sink.
The long STEADICAM SHOT is about to come to a glorious end
after showing the semi-basement’s family complete and
successful infiltration of the Park mansion. Wait. Not yet-Da-Song suddenly starts sniffing the air. He runs over to
Chung-Sook and shoves his nose in her belly, startling her
greatly.
Da-Song then darts over to Ki-Tek and shoves his nose in his
pant leg.
Da-Song!

YON-KYO
What’s wrong with you?

DA-SONG
Same smell. They smell exactly
the same!
Ki-Tek and Chung-Sook freeze.
Yon-Kyo, embarrassed, roughly pushes Da-Song away.

DA-SONG
That’s weird. Ms. Jessica has the

They all laugh, but no one is laughing inside.

The table teems with food. We notice the viewing stone
displayed prominently in the middle. An interesting decorating
choice.
Ki-Tek is cooking ribs and mushrooms on an electric skillet
when he suddenly smells his clothes.
KI-TEK
He scared me, the little punk.
Does this mean we all have to use
different soaps?
KI-WOO
Maybe we should all wash our
clothes with different detergent.
Different fabric softeners too.
CHUNG-SOOK
You mean I have to wash all of
your clothes separately? Fuck no.
KI-JUNG
(expressionless)
It won’t work. It’s the basement
smell.
Ki-Woo is blank.

KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
The smell won’t go away unless we
leave this place.
Truth bomb. They all fall silent at the brutal reality check,
and for a while we only hear the sizzling of the grill.
Ki-Tek picks up his Sapporo and tries to change the subject.
KI-TEK
Forget about that. This is a good
problem to have. Think about our
lives before. It’s a dog-eat-dog
world out there. Hundreds of
college graduates compete for a
security guard job for Chrissake.

Not us. We are all gainfully
employed.
KI-WOO
You’re right, Father.

Cheers!

KI-TEK
Sure we may not be getting sixfigure salaries, but it’s no small
amount if you combine our wages.
The Parks are investing a great
part of their fortune in our
family. So let us give thanks to
Mr. Park, our generous employer.
A great man. And how can I forget
Min-Hyuk! How lucky that our son
is friends with such a thoughtful
young man. It’s all because of
him that-- FUCK! Do they always
have to ruin the moment?
The family members all turn toward -The window, which is being rattled by a robust stream of urine.
A SHORT, BARELY STANDING DRUNK MAN is relieving himself in the
corner.
KI-WOO
That mother-Ki-woo jumps up. He grabs the viewing stone from the table and
walks toward the door.
Ki-Tek, worried, quickly runs after him.
KI-JUNG
(scoffs)
Oh, no. Here comes the rage
machine.

60.
CHUNG-SOOK
Why’s he acting tough all of a
sudden? Is he trying to kill
someone?
Ki-Tek catches up to Ki-Woo and wrests the stone from his
hands.
Ki-Woo picks up an umbrella instead.

He runs out.

Ki-Jung lights up. This is going to be fun. She opens the
HIGH-SPEED PHOTOGRAPHY APP on her phone and starts filming. We
see the following sequence through the app, in slow motion -Ki-Woo appears outside the window and starts swinging the
umbrella wildly at the Short Man, who sprays urine everywhere
as he falls.
Ki-Tek runs out with a bucket of water. He throws the water at
the Short Man but momentarily loses balance and splashes Ki-Woo
instead.
Ki-Jung laughs.

This is gold.

Chung-Sook has no interest. She continues grilling meat, happy
to finish the food by herself.
UNSETTLING MUSIC plays over the wild, primal thrashing of the
three men. The violent, rage-fueled dance DISSOLVES TO -63

The garden is sun-drenched. Da-Song looks up at the sky
through a piece of soot-covered glass, an improvised sunviewer. He has a bow and axe strapped to his back.

Copy that. I’m here in the

into a duck! She looks pissed,

Dong-Ik giggles as he teases Da-Hae, who looks completely
miserable in her camping outfit.
YON-KYO
What’s with the face? Let’s all
try to have a good time.
DA-HAE
Can’t I just stay home and study
with Kevin?
YON-KYO
I know you hate camping, but it’s
Da-Song’s birthday. And you’re
his sister. Come on. It won’t be
so bad. We’ll build a fire. Sing
happy birthday at midnight. Blow
out candles under the stars.
It’ll be wonderful.
Chung-Sook brings up a tent bag and a guitar case from the
storage basement.
Da-Hae gives up and puts on her large bluetooth headphones,
shutting out reality.
Yon-Kyo takes Chung-Sook to the living room where the three
dogs are.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you know all of their
names by now.

Berry, Junie, Foofoo.
CHUNG-SOOK
Of course. Berry and Junie only

Yon-Kyo emphasizes by pointing at each of the dog’s foods in

YON-KYO
Yes. And Foofoo also needs this

CHUNG-SOOK
Don’t worry!
Yon-Kyo is sitting in the driver seat, endlessly rattling off
instructions until -The garage door goes all the way up, and the Mercedes starts
rolling out.
Da-Song pretends to shoot an arrow from the backseat, and
Chung-Sook grabs her chest like she was shot.
Moments later she’s finally alone. She presses the button.
Her face gradually immerses in darkness as the shutter goes
down.

INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Chung-Sook is taking a peaceful nap on the large sofa. We hear
her soft breathing. Slanted late afternoon rays wrap her face
warmly.
She slowly wakes up and wipes her drool. When she sits up, we
see Ki-Tek sleeping behind her. Chung-Sook looks out at the
garden where -Ki-Woo is lying in the grass with the three dogs. Looking at
the sky. We notice a YELLOW JOURNAL clutched in his hand.
CHUNG-SOOK
What are you doing out there?
Come inside.
Ki-Woo takes a deep breath as he gazes up at the sky.

He’s

You should try it. It’s nice to
be able to see the sky from your

Sure.

He gives

A groggy Ki-Tek gets up from the sofa and trudges over to a
cabinet in the corner. A variety of whiskeys are on display.

INT. MANSION - 2ND FLOOR BATHROOM - EVENING

Ki-Jung is taking a bubble bath. She picks up the remote and
changes the channel on the wall-mounted TV when -A KNOCK.
KI-WOO (O.S.)
You want a water?
KI-JUNG
Read my mind. Thanks, brodie.
The door opens a crack, and Ki-Woo rolls a bottle toward KiJung. He then continues on to -68

INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - EVENING

68

Ki-Woo throws himself on Da-Hae’s bed. He reaches into the
space between the bed and the wall and finds a PRETTY WOODEN
BOX hidden there. Da-Hae’s box of secrets. It has a small
combination lock on the front.
Ki-Woo unlocks the box and puts in the yellow journal he was
reading. He then takes out ANOTHER YELLOW JOURNAL and opens
it.
Pages filled with Da-Hae’s small, thoughtful handwriting.

INT. MANSION - SAUNA - EVENING

Ki-Tek sits with a white towel across his lap, sweating it out
in the steam-filled room. He guzzles down a cold bottle of
Evian. Refreshing. He turns the HOURGLASS upside down.
The sound of myriad sand grains rolling down the glass turns
into -- THE SOUND OF RAIN.

INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

70

The large coffee table is filled with various whiskey bottles
and gourmet snacks. The four family members are comfortably
sprawled across the couch and floor. It’s like they own the
place.
They sip whiskey and watch rain falling outside the window.

64.
KI-TEK
This is classy. Sipping whiskey
on a rainy day. Enjoying the
view.
Ki-Tek takes several bottles and pours a little of each into
his tumbler.
CHUNG-SOOK
What the hell are you doing? Why
are you mixing all the booze?
KI-TEK
This way Mr. Park won’t notice.
It’ll be too obvious if we drink
from only one bottle.
CHUNG-SOOK
Nice to see you use that brain for
once.
Berry comes over to Chung-Sook wagging her tail, but Chung-Sook
kicks her away. Chung-Sook is already drunk. Her face is
bright red.
KI-JUNG
But you always get shitfaced when
you mix your drinks, Dad.
KI-TEK
(smiles)
Ki-Jung, that’s no way to talk to
your father. “Shitfaced.” No.
Not you too.
KI-WOO
Let me pour you a shot, Father.
Ki-Woo tries to lighten the mood.
he pours a shot with both hands.

He looks out the window as

KI-WOO (CONT’D)
It’s probably raining at the
campsite too. They must be having
a magical time. Da-Hae and her
family. Raindrops pattering the
tent. Playing the guitar...
CHUNG-SOOK
By the way. What’s that yellow
notebook you’ve been carrying?
This?

KI-WOO

65.
Ki-Woo picks up the yellow journal.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Da-Hae’s diary.
KI-JUNG
Oh, my God. Why are you reading
that?
KI-WOO
I just want to understand her on a
deeper level.
KI-JUNG
Disgusting. You two going out or
something?
KI-WOO
(nods)
It’s serious. She likes me too.
I’m going to officially ask her
out when she goes to college. For
real.
They all stare at Ki-Woo.

He must be shitting them.

But he’s

Ki-Tek slaps Ki-Woo’s shoulder.
KI-TEK
That’s my boy! That means this is
your future wife’s house! The
Parks will be your in-laws!
KI-WOO
(laughs)
I guess that’s true.
Chung-Sook joins the laughter.
CHUNG-SOOK
You mean I’m fucking washing
dishes for my future in-laws?
KI-TEK
Hilarious! You’re washing your
future in-law’s tighty-whities!
Your daughter-in-law’s school
socks!
Ki-Tek pretends to wash a sock, laughing hysterically, when he
suddenly feels Chung-Sook’s murderous glare. He slowly stops.
Chung-Sook downs her whiskey and turns serious.
turns to Ki-Woo.

She calmly

66.
CHUNG-SOOK
I like that girl. She’s nice.
Pretty. But not full of herself.
KI-WOO
Well, as long as we’re getting
ahead of ourselves -- If you think
about it, nowadays people barely
see their in-laws anyway. How
many times do you think families
see each other after their kids
get married?
KI-JUNG
(scoffs)
Crazy fuck.
KI-WOO
You hear about people hiring
actors to stand in for their
parents at weddings. We’ll do the
same thing. A lot of TV extras do
that kind of work.
Ki-Woo points at Ki-Jung.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
She did too. Got paid to be one
of the bride’s guests. She went
to a bunch of weddings last year.
KI-JUNG
I even caught a bouquet once.
First time I ever saw the bitch.
They pay ten bucks extra for the
bouquet.
CHUNG-SOOK
(laughs)
That’s how you became such a good
actress!
Good times continue as whiskey flows.
abound.

Jokes and laughter

KI-TEK
Sure the acting was good, but I
was surprised that the family was
so easy to trick.
CHUNG-SOOK
Especially the missus. Not the
sharpest knife in the drawer. I
guess we should be thankful for
that--

67.
KI-TEK
Yes, she’s so innocent. And kind.
A rich person who’s also
kindhearted.
Chung-Sook stops mid-sip and stares at Ki-Tek.
CHUNG-SOOK
Not “also kindhearted.” She’s
kindhearted because she’s rich.
You get it?
Ki-Tek doesn’t.

Chung-Sook looks around --

CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
If I had all this, my heart would
be overflowing with kindness!
Chung-Sook’s voice grows.

She gulps downs another glass.

KI-TEK
That’s true. Your mother has a
point. Rich people are more
naive. They don’t have a bitter
bone in them. And the kids are
happier. No wiseasses.
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s the money! Money cures all
the little wiseasses!
Ki-Jung slowly grows irritated as her parents go on and on
about rich people. She tosses back her whiskey.
KI-TEK
Ki-Woo. That guy. What was his
name? Yun? The old driver.
Yes.

KI-WOO
Mr. Yun.

KI-TEK
He’s probably doing fine, right?
I’m sure he got a new job.
KI-WOO
Of course. He’s young. Healthy.
Plenty of opportunities.
KI-TEK
Yeah, I’m sure he got an even
better job.
Ki-Jung SLAMS down her glass and yells at her family --

68.
KI-JUNG
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
KI-WOO
What the hell’s wrong with you?
KI-JUNG
Fuck rich people! Just worry
about your own goddamn family!
Ki-Jung looks like she’s about to cry. We’ve never seen her
like this before. Vulnerable. Like a hurt child.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Dad, please. Stop worrying about
other people. Look at me. Us.
Your son and daughter. We’re
right here!
Almost at the exact moment as Ki-Jung’s soulful outburst, like
a timed effect, LIGHTNING AND THUNDER strike outside the
window. Followed by heavy rain.
Ki-Tek looks out the window.
KI-TEK
(laughing)
Did you see that!

Right on cue!

KI-WOO
(imitating Ki-Jung)
“Dad, we’re right here!” POW!
Thunder and lightning! Awesome.
Ki-Woo tries to console Ki-Jung.
in a brotherly voice.

He brushes her hair and talks

KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Come on now, Jessica. Let’s
drink. Cheers!
Ki-Woo clinks his glass against Ki-Jung’s.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
You know, Ki-Jung, when I saw you
upstairs in the bathroom-- You
looked so-What?

KI-JUNG
I looked so what?

KI-WOO
You just looked so natural in that
bathtub. This house. It suits
you. You’re not like us.

69.
KI-JUNG
(smiles)
Fuck off.
KI-WOO
(to Ki-Tek)
It’s true, Dad. She was in the
tub watching TV, taking a fancy
bubble bath, and it just felt like
she belonged here.
KI-TEK
Is that right?
Ki-Woo becomes more animated at Ki-Tek’s exaggerated reaction.
He opens his arms wide and looks around at the living room.
KI-WOO
Imagine for a second that this is
our house. Let’s say we live
here. Which room would you like
to have? Out of all the beautiful
rooms designed by the great
Namgoong Hyunja, which one would
you want to be yours?
KI-JUNG
I don’t know. Buy me the fucking
house first and I’ll think about
it.
KI-TEK
We’re ‘living’ here right now,
aren’t we? We’re here in the
living room, drinking and having a
good time, just like we would if
this was our place.
KI-WOO
That’s true. We ARE currently
living here. For all intents and
purposes.
KI-TEK
This IS our house right now.
(burps)
Nice and cozy.
Chung-Sook, face bulging red, flashes a dirty grin.
CHUNG-SOOK
You’re cozy, huh? That’s real
nice. What if Park comes back
right now?
(to Ki-Jung)
He would skitter away like a
little cockroach.

70.
Chung-Sook laughs loudly at her own joke.

Ki-Tek is quiet.

CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
(snickering)
You kids know what I’m talking
about, right? Our apartment. How
when we turn on the kitchen
lights, the roaches all run away
and disappear under the cabinets.
He would be exactly like that!
Ki-Tek stares hard at Chung-Sook, who continues to howl. KiTek’s eyes are red. Hostile. This is a different Ki-Tek.
KI-TEK
(mumbling)
Fucking bitch. You’ve gone too
far this time.
Chung-Sook is silent.
What?

KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I’m a cockroach?

CRASH! Ki-Tek sweeps the table and knocks over the bottles and
plates.
Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung are stunned.
Chung-Sook is absolutely still. She glowers at Ki-Tek, who
unlike before doesn’t back down. He stares right back, tension
growing, when -His face starts cracking.
Chung-Sook does too.

He begins to snicker.

They both burst into laughter.

KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I got you! I totally got you!
The two continue to laugh their asses off. Ki-Tek seems
especially pleased with his performance. He slaps Ki-Woo on
the shoulder.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
How was that, Spielberg? Pretty
realistic right? You like my
acting now?
Wow, Dad!

KI-WOO
You totally got me.

Ki-Jung laughs, relieved.

71.
KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Tek)
Shit. You’re going to clean this
up, right?
CHUNG-SOOK
(laughing)
I didn’t believe him for one
second.
KI-WOO
Really? I thought he was really
going to kill you.
CHUNG-SOOK
He could never do that. Your
father hasn’t a single backbone in
his body. The epitome of a
spineless mo-They are all laughing uproariously when -The DOORBELL rings loudly throughout the house.
They all freeze and look at each other. Who the hell could
that be? The doorbell continues to ring.
KI-WOO
Who could it be at this time?
KI-TEK
What do you think it is?
Chung-Sook scurries over to the gate monitor.

She sees --

A familiar round face filling the screen. It’s MUN-KWANG.
She’s standing in the rain dressed in all black.
CHUNG-SOOK
What the-KI-WOO
Why is she here?
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s her, right? The old
housekeeper.
KI-JUNG
(nods)
Why do you think she’s here?
Mun-Kwang presses the doorbell again and again. It rings
loudly throughout the neighborhood. This could go on for a
while.

72.
KI-TEK
What’s she doing?
just leave?

Why doesn’t she

KI-JUNG
It’s so loud. She could go on all
night-CHUNG-SOOK
(cutting her off)
Hold on. I’m supposed to be here.
I can answer.
Before Ki-Woo can stop her, Chung-Sook presses the ‘speak’
button.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
Who is it?
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER)
Hi, how are you? I’m-- Mrs. Park
isn’t in, right?
Mun-Kwang’s speech is slightly slurred.

She’s had a drink or

You’re my replacement, aren’t you!
Mun-Kwang laughs.

Sad, drunk laughter.

Chung-Sook remains on

Mun-Kwang suddenly turns serious.
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER) (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry to bother you at this
hour. There’s something in the
basement that I left behind, and I
was wondering if I could pick it
up. I was fired without any
notice so I didn’t have time to
gather all my things.

What do we do?

Ki-Woo has no

This wasn’t in our plan.

INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chung-Sook opens the door to reveal Mun-Kwang standing in the
rain. She looks grotesque with one eye heavily swollen. Her
face is eerily and intermittently illuminated by the motionsensor light.
72

INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

72

Mun-Kwang drips water as she walks over to the kitchen. The
living room is not fully visible from her vantage point.
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung remain in the dark around the
coffee table, listening to Chung-Sook and Mun-Kwang’s
conversation.
MUN-KWANG
I’m sorry for the intrusion.
Thank you so much for letting me
in.
She looks over at the kitchen sink.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
The faucet drips if you turn it
that way.
Mun-Kwang continues to drone on deliriously.
she’s just drunk or crazy.

We don’t know if

CHUNG-SOOK
The faucet’s fine. What do you
need to pick up?
MUN-KWANG
Would you like to come down with
me?
Mun-Kwang flashes a creepy grin as she points to the stairs
descending into the dark storage basement.
Chung-Sook is spooked.

She hesitates.

CHUNG-SOOK
No thanks. Just hurry up and get
what you need.

74.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

73

CLOSE ON -- A DROP OF WATER precariously dangling from the
kitchen faucet.
It’s been a while since Mun-Kwang went down to the storage
room. Chung-Sook starts getting worried. She gets up from the
chair.
74

INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - NIGHT

74

A nervous Chung-Sook walks down the narrow staircase and peers
into the darkness. She hears a strange MOAN coming from inside
and soon discovers -Mun-Kwang levitating horizontally in the air! We realize that
she actually has her feet set against the wall and is pushing
the jar cabinet with her hands. The glass jars rattle as she
shoves with all her might.
Chung-Sook is confused.
MUN-KWANG
Can you give me a hand?
push!
Huh?

Help me

CHUNG-SOOK

MUN-KWANG
(tearful)
He’s going to die! Please!
CHUNG-SOOK
What’s going on-MUN-KWANG
Just help me first!
Chung-Sook has no idea what’s going on but starts pushing with
Mun-Kwang.
We see Ki-Woo, Ki-Jung, and Ki-Tek peeking from the staircase.
Chung-Sook sees something on the ground as she’s pushing.
Wait.

CHUNG-SOOK
Maybe this is the problem.

Chung-Sook pulls a bundle of wires stuck under the cabinet.
soon as she does --

As

75.
The cabinet smoothly rolls to the side pretty much on its own,
as if it’s set on rails. It moves out of view to reveal, to
Chung-Sook’s great astonishment -A DARK STEEL DOOR hidden behind it.
Mun-Kwang opens the door and hurries inside.
Chung-Sook shakes off her shock and follows Mun-Kwang down the
dark staircase.
75

INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT
Babe!

75

MUN-KWANG
Babe!

We get glimpses of the dark underground bunker as Mun-Kwang
waves around the flashlight on her cell phone -- low ceiling,
gray walls, a small passageway...
Chung-Sook covers her nose at the awful smell.
Kun-Sae!

MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)

Mun-Kwang’s flashlight finally finds -A PALE, SEVERELY MALNOURISHED FACE. This is KUN-SAE, 45, MunKwang’s husband. He looks up from his cot, woken up by the
sound. He blinks his large eyes.
Chung-Sook looks horrified.
KUN-SAE
Stop yelling. I’m okay...
Mun-Kwang immediately shoves a BABY BOTTLE in his mouth and
starts feeding him. It’s filled with some kind of gruel.
MUN-KWANG
No, you’re not. You’re not okay!
(weeping)
Why are you in the dark? Why did
you turn off the lights?
KUN-SAE
We have to conserve energy.

pocket.

Kun-Sae turns on the light and is startled to see -Chung-Sook standing in front of him.

76.
He springs from his bed, but Mun-Kwang pushes him back down.
MUN-KWANG
It’s fine. We’re okay.
Mun-Kwang points at Chung-Sook.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
She’s a friend. She helped me get
in here. It was the damn wires.
They were stuck under the cabinet.
KUN-SAE
No wonder.
(laughs weakly)
I tried everything but I couldn’t
get it to open. I couldn’t go up
to the kitchen.
MUN-KWANG
(sobbing)
How many days have you gone
without food? I’m so sorry, babe!
Chung-Sook is at a loss.
Ki-Woo, Ki-Jung, and Ki-Tek have followed Chung-Sook and MunKwang down and are eavesdropping from the staircase. They look
stunned.
CHUNG-SOOK
What are you people up to?
are you--

Why

MUN-KWANG
I know how this looks. You must
think we’re crazy. But please,
Chung-Sook. Have some pity. Us
domestic workers, we’re sisters-CHUNG-SOOK
(surprised)
How the hell do you know my name?
MUN-KWANG
Da-Song and I still text from time
to time. I came here because I
knew the family would be on a
camping trip. I wanted to talk to
you alone.
Chung-Sook can’t believe her ears.

Surprise turns to anger.

MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, sis. No one knows
I’m here.

77.
Mun-Kwang removes a pair of wire cutters from her pocket.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
I cut the wires on the
surveillance camera on my way in.
That’s good, right? Huh, big sis?
CHUNG-SOOK
Wait. Hold on. Aren’t you older
than me?
MUN-KWANG
I was born in 74. Year of the
tiger. My name is Mun-Kwang.
Chung-Sook is speechless.

Mun-Kwang points to Kun-Sae.

MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
This is my husband Oh Kun-Sae.
Kun-Sae smiles innocently as he continues to suck on the empty
bottle.
Chung-Sook regards the scene with disbelief.
Mun-Kwang takes out a banana from her pocket.
feeds it to Kun-Sae.
CHUNG-SOOK
So the whole time you were working
here, you were smuggling food down
from the kitchen?
MUN-KWANG
No! Everything he ate came from
my pocket. From the money I made
here. I never stole anything!
CHUNG-SOOK
Sure. And how long has he been
down here? Your husband.
MUN-KWANG
Let’s see-- About four years?
CHUNG-SOOK
You gotta be kidding me.
KUN-SAE
Four years, three months, and
seventeen days to be exact!
Kun-Sae laughs.

She peels it and

78.
MUN-KWANG
That’s right. It’s already June.
He started living here after Mr.
Namgoong moved out four years ago.
Before Da-Song’s family moved in.
Chung-Sook looks around the room. It has a toilet, sink, small
fridge, an old-fashioned TV set... Enough amenities to survive
underground.
Mun-Kwang continues to speak, blinking her swollen eyes.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
A lot of these rich people, they
build bunkers and secret rooms in
their homes. You know, in case
the North Koreans invade, or in
case creditors come knocking on
their doors. Maybe Mr. Namgoong
felt embarrassed about building
such a room. He didn’t mention it
to the Parks when he sold the
house.
Huh.

CHUNG-SOOK

MUN-KWANG
Nobody in the house knew about the
room. Except me.
CHUNG-SOOK
Some balls you got. Well, now I
know too! And I know what I’m
going to do!
Chung-Sook takes out her phone.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
Call the fucking cops.
Mun-Kwang drops to her knees and starts begging.
MUN-KWANG
Please sis!
(sobs)
We’re all in the same boat, aren’t
we? We all need a little help to
get by.
No!

CHUNG-SOOK
I’m not your fucking sister,
bitch. And I don’t need nobody’s
help.

79.
MUN-KWANG
Well, I do! I don’t have a house.
I don’t have money. All I have is
a mountain of debt.
CHUNG-SOOK
What do you want me to do about
it?
MUN-KWANG
He’s been down here for four
years, and the loan sharks still
won’t let go. They’re obsessed.
They say they’re going to kill
him!
CHUNG-SOOK
You borrowed from loan sharks?
Mun-Kwang nods.
KUN-SAE
It’s all my fault.
(laughs, embarrassed)
I started a cake shop -- Taiwanese
Castella -- and it completely
bankrupted us.
Kun-Sae laughs again.

A nervous habit.

When Ki-Tek hears the word ‘Castella,’ his face crowds with
emotion. He knows the shame.
Mun-Kwang hands Chung-Sook an envelope.
MUN-KWANG
Please, take this.
CHUNG-SOOK
What is this?
MUN-KWANG
It’s not much, I know. But I can
send you money every month. All I
ask is that you come down here
every other day and leave him
something to eat. Actually no.
Once a week is fine. There’s a
little fridge down here so-CHUNG-SOOK
Are you crazy? You people are
unbelievable-- Get away from me.
Chung-Sook lifts her phone.

80.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
I’m going to call the cops.
Ki-Tek and the kids look worried. That wouldn’t be good for
them either. Ki-Tek is awkwardly leaning over, listening to
the conversation, when -His foot slips and he falls down the stairs! He is unable to
control his large body and takes down Ki-Jung and Ki-Woo with
him. Ki-Jung screams.
Chung-Sook is startled when she sees the family spilling down
the stairs.
Mun-Kwang is even more confused.
Kim! Why are they here?

It’s Kevin, Jessica, and Mr.

MUN-KWANG
What the hell?
KUN-SAE
(laughs)
Honey, who are all these people?
MUN-KWANG
Ms. Jessica? Mr. Kim... What’s
everyone doing down here?
Mun-Kwang is speechless for a moment before the pieces slowly
come together in her head. She takes out her cell phone.
As Ki-Tek scrambles to get up, he accidentally steps on KiWoo’s foot.
Ow!

KI-WOO
Dad, my foot!

Chung-Sook and Ki-Jung immediately freeze. Ki-Woo realizes
what he just said and turns pale. He sees -Mun-Kwang recording everything on her cell phone.
MUN-KWANG
Now I get it.
(nods)
I knew something wasn’t right-Mun-Kwang plays back the footage she just shot -Ow!

KI-WOO (VIDEO)
Dad, my foot!

Ki-Woo’s face and voice are clearly recorded on video.

81.
Finally everything comes together for Mun-Kwang.
Ki-Woo is devastated.
MUN-KWANG
Now I get it. You’re all a
family. A family that scams
people together.
KI-WOO
It’s not like that-MUN-KWANG
I knew something was off when Yun
was fired for no reason. You
despicable-CHUNG-SOOK
Listen, sis-MUN-KWANG
I’m not your sister, you liferuining bitch.
Mun-Kwang shows Chung-Sook her phone.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Why don’t I send this little video
to Mrs. Park right now?
The video is already being prepped for transfer on her
messenger app.
Ki-Woo and family are sweating. Ki-Tek, still a little tipsy
from the whiskey, says quietly to Ki-Jung -KI-TEK
There’s probably no reception down
here.
Ki-Jung looks at her phone.
KI-JUNG
Actually it’s pretty good.
Fuck.

KI-TEK

KI-WOO
Please.
We really need these
jobs, and we went through a lot to
get them. We’re not scam artists.
We’re--

82.
MUN-KWANG
(cutting him off)
Shut up! I don’t give a shit! I
don’t care if we all go to prison.
I’ll fucking end everything right
here!
KI-TEK
SHUT UP!!!!
Ki-Tek thunders loudly, silencing everyone in the room.
frowns and covers his ears.

Ki-Woo

KI-TEK (CONT’D)
Are you crazy, lady!
Mun-Kwang is puzzled by Ki-Tek’s random outburst.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
Imagine how upset the Parks would
be if they saw the video.
(screaming)
They are nice people! And they’ve
shown nothing but kindness! Why

Upon seeing the atrocious acts

It was. Park would be at work.

Ki-Jung rushes back to the living room with the black bag. She
pours the contents -- A DOZEN OR SO PEACHES -- over Mun-Kwang’s

Mun-Kwang screams.
Ki-Jung picks up one of the peaches and squashes it against

Mun-Kwang sticks her tongue out and starts coughing violently.

KI-TEK
Hurry!

At Ki-Tek’s command, the family jump into action.
Ki-Jung starts clearing the bottles with lightning speed, and
Ki-Tek drags Kun-Sae toward the basement.
Ki-Woo roughly pulls up Mun-Kwang. Her eyes are heavily
swollen like she just went through ten rounds with Mike Tyson.
She coughs incessantly as she is hauled away.
Chung-Sook is solely focused on the japaguri. She looks up the

Mun-Kwang tumbles down and slams her head hard on one of the

He sees that Mun-Kwang is unconscious and starts panicking. He
slaps her in the face. He’s relieved when Mun-Kwang lets out a
weak moan.
Ki-Tek starts tying her with a cord when he hears a strange
noise coming from below. He rushes down the stairs to see -Kun-Sae, arms still tied, banging his head against a series of
electrical switches on the wall. A truly bizarre sight.
KI-TEK
What the hell are you doing?

Ki-Jung hides under the table again. Having nowhere to go, KiWoo and Ki-Tek also crawl underneath.

Da-Song running down the stairs, dressed in a raincoat. He’s
wearing a backpack and also has the folded TEEPEE strapped
across his shoulders.

Dangling all kinds of camping gear over his raincoat, Da-Song
storms through the living room and heads to the garden. He
opens the glass door and jumps out into the pouring rain.
He then starts building the teepee in the middle of the yard.
He’s quick, efficient. A true Scout.

Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik hesitate at the door, still in their

out.
Da-Song has already finished setting up the teepee and is now
working on the inside.
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung attempt to make a run while Yon-Kyo

Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung nearly shriek when Da-Hae’s wriggly
feet come within inches of their faces.
Meanwhile Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik give up on Da-Song and return to

You think that’s what Da-Song was
talking about?
DONG-IK
It’s hard to explain. I smell it
when I ride the subway sometimes.
YON-KYO
I haven’t ridden the subway in
forever.
DONG-IK
There’s this unique smell that
subway commuters have-Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung can do nothing but silently take
hit after hit. Ki-Tek is completely expressionless.
On the sofa, Dong-Ik slowly slides up his hand and caresses
Yon-Kyo’s breasts over her pajama top.
YON-KYO
(quiet)
What are you doing?
DONG-IK
It feels like we’re in the
backseat of a car, doesn’t it?
Dong-Ik sounds like a horny high school boy. He puts his hand
inside Yon-Kyo’s pajama top and continues fondling her.
Yon-Kyo looks up at the kitchen and the stairs to make sure no
one is watching. She closes her eyes and gives in to pleasure.
YON-KYO
(moaning)
Clockwise.
Dong-Ik moves his hand as instructed. It starts migrating
below Yon-Kyo’s navel. Their bodies grow closer. Breathing
becomes labored.
DONG-IK
Do you have a pair of really cheap
panties?

YON-KYO
Cheap panties?
DONG-IK
Those panties that Yun left
behind. Something like that.
Real cheap and tacky.

Ki-Jung tries to keep a cool face as the rich couple continue
to malign her underwear.
Ki-Tek’s face is dark.

He’s more humiliated than she is.

Meanwhile Yon-Kyo is pushed closer toward climax by the
underpants talk. She bites her lips but is hardly able to
suppress her moans. Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung hear
everything under the table.
A heavy fatigue comes over Ki-Tek’s face.

Hiding in the dark kitchen, Chung-Sook looks over at the living

Under the table, Ki-Tek receives the text. He signals Ki-Jung
to go first. She slides out and starts crawling toward the
garage stairs. Ki-Woo goes next. Once they are safely across,
they wait for Ki-Tek.

Ki-Tek is slowly making his way when -A STRONG BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly penetrates the living room. A

Ki-Tek curls into a tight ball to avoid the wildly roaming

We hear Da-Song’s voice through the fuzz -Mayday!

DA-SONG (RADIO)
Mayday! Dad, come in!

Ki-Tek freezes. There’s nowhere to hide. He can only close
his eyes and hope he doesn’t get discovered.
Dong-Ik wakes up and picks up the walkie-talkie. He looks out

Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik are too concerned with Da-Song to notice

Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo can’t help but laugh.

Ki-Tek and the kids trudge silently through the rain. They’re
walking on the side of a gloomy four-lane road, no longer in
the nice part of town. They don’t bother going into a store to
buy an umbrella. They don’t bother hailing a cab. They just
walk, their faces steeped in anguish.

We look down on a hillside neighborhood. A different hillside
view. Working class. Illuminated by the lights of low-income
apartments. The gates of poverty.
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung stop under an overpass, out of
breath. We see them as silhouettes.

Ki-Tek doesn’t have one.

Ki-Woo, still in a daze, mumbles to himself -KI-WOO

KI-JUNG
Min-Hyuk wouldn’t have gotten

Ki-Jung is about to lash out further when Ki-Tek calmly steps
forward.

Calm down. Both of you.
Ki-Jung seethes.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
We made it out of that house,

We did.

Total pandemonium. Sewage backflows. A SEMI-BASEMENT RESIDENT

Da-Song unzips the tent and looks at the living room across the

No.

KI-TEK
I mean this.

Dong-Ik sees that one of the feathers was pushed too far. The
tip is poking out from the bottom of the headband. He still
can’t shake the feeling that Ki-Tek was talking about a
different ‘line.’
Ki-Tek pushes up the errant feather with his finger.

KI-JUNG
(whispering)
Have you been down there?
CHUNG-SOOK
No, I’ve been too busy.
KI-JUNG
Shouldn’t we try to talk to them?
Try to reach an agreement.
CHUNG-SOOK
I think so too. We all got too
emotional yesterday.
Ki-Jung looks around before saying -KI-JUNG
I’ll go down there and see how
they’re doing.
Chung-Sook nods. From under the table, she takes out a LARGE
PARTY PLATTER filled with various foods.
CHUNG-SOOK
Here. Take this with you. I made
it for them just in case. They’ll
be more willing to talk if their
stomachs are full.
Ki-Jung nods. She takes the platter and adds a few more
meatballs from the buffet table. She is about to go down to
the basement when -She hears Yon-Kyo’s high-pitched laughter coming from the
living room.
YON-KYO (O.S.)
Jessica! I was looking for you!
What are you doing there? Come
out here.
Ki-Jung slowly puts the platter down behind her.

Chung-Sook quickly escapes, taking more food out to the garden.
Yon-Kyo comes in and pulls Ki-Jung out to the -LIVING ROOM
Where she shows Ki-Jung a GOURMET CREAM CAKE sitting on the
coffee table.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
This cake is very symbolic. It
has a therapeutic significance,
you know, related to Da-Song’s
trauma. I want you to bring it
out, Jessica. It has to be you.
It’ll be the highlight of the day!
As Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung admire the cake -We see Ki-Woo quietly walking down the stairs, out of focus in
the background. He has the GRAY BAG over his shoulder. He
enters the kitchen and walks down to the storage basement.

Ki-Woo pushes the jar cabinet to the side, revealing the dark

opens the door. He walks down one step at a time, holding up
his cell phone flashlight.

INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - DAY

The room is pitch black. Once he reaches the bottom of the
stairs, Ki-Woo removes the viewing stone from the gray bag.
His hands tremble, and he starts breathing faster. With his
cell phone flashlight tucked in his breast pocket, he carefully
makes his way in, eventually finding -A tied-up Mun-Kwang fallen next to the toilet.
Ki-Woo swallows nervously. His legs grow weak and his eyes
brim with tears as he slowly walks up to Mun-Kwang’s head.
He raises the stone to strike Mun-Kwang but -He can’t do it.
He just stands there, face covered in snot and tears, shaking
uncontrollably, when -We notice a CIRCULAR OBJECT ‘floating’ behind Ki-Woo. A NOOSE.
Kun-Sae has untied his cord and formed a noose with it. He
slowly brings it above Ki-Woo’s head.

He

Too late. Kun-Sae quickly wraps the noose around Ki-Woo’s neck

and hits his foot, which causes him to further lose his
balance. He is dragged across the floor by Kun-Sae.
We can only see Kun-Sae’s maniacal eyes in the darkness as he

Ki-Woo thrashes violently.

Kun-Sae chases Ki-Woo with the stone.
Ki-Woo has just made it past the jar cabinet when -Kun-Sae grabs the cord dragging behind Ki-Woo and pulls it
hard. Ki-Woo flies backward into the air and -SLAM! -- Falls hard on the floor.

His wind is knocked out.

Kun-Sae runs up to Ki-Woo. He raises the stone high and brings
it down on Ki-Woo’s head! We hear a horrifying crunch as we -SMASH TO:

rectangle remains where the tape covered his mouth.

Kun-Sae looks down at his feet where Ki-Woo is lying. Blood is
slowly pooling around Ki-Woo’s head, pushing out the puddles of
plum extract spilled on the floor.
Kun-Sae picks up the viewing stone from the floor and slams KiWoo’s head again! Ki-Woo’s fingers tremble. Is he still
conscious? Or was that the last flicker of life...

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

Kun-Sae trudges up the stairs and arrives in the bright
kitchen. A surreal juxtaposition. His ghostly, blood-smeared
mask against the pure white kitchen. Out in the garden he
sees, through laughing and applauding party guests -Ki-Jung, holding Da-Song’s birthday cake.
Kun-Sae picks up a large kitchen knife from the sink and walks
toward the garden. As soon as he disappears -Da-Hae comes down the stairs and pokes her head inside the
kitchen.
Kevin!
132

DA-HAE
Kevin, where are you?

EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY

132

Ki-Jung walks down the ‘aisle’ between the Party Guests, slowly
so the candles don’t blow out.
An embarrassed but obviously excited Da-Song waits in front of
the tent. He watches his favorite teacher Ms. Jessica bringing
him the cake when -Everyone SCREAMS, and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.
Ki-Jung looks back to see -Kun-Sae running toward her with the kitchen knife.
Ki-Jung shoves the cake in Kun-Sae’s face just as he swings the
knife. But a beat too late as the knife plunges into her
chest.
Kun-Sae pulls the knife, and blood plumes from Ki-Jung’s chest.
It sprays over the white cream covering exactly half of KunSae’s face.
When Ki-Jung falls, Da-Song sees Kun-Sae looming over him,
dripping with Jessica’s blood. The ghost.

126.
Da-Song screams. A truly horrible scream. Louder and two
octaves higher than the Guests. His eyes roll back, and he
goes into a full-on seizure. We hear Yon-Kyo’s scream from
somewhere in the crowd.
Kun-Sae pulls up Ki-Jung and puts the knife to her throat.
shouts to the Guests --

KUN-SAE
Don’t move!
Ki-Tek and Dong-Ik are running out from the trees when they
stop at Kun-Sae’s voice. The chaotically fleeing Guests also
freeze in their tracks.
A tense moment. A WHITE BUTTERFLY flies over to Kun-Sae and
flutters its wings above his cake-covered head.
KUN-SAE (CONT’D)
Chung-Sook! Where are you!
out you fucking bitch!

Come

Chung-Sook emerges from behind the crowd.
Ki-Jung.
Ki-Jung!

Her eyes are set on

CHUNG-SOOK
Wake up!

Ki-Jung is bleeding profusely.

She lets out a weak moan.

CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
(screaming)
Put pressure on the wound, KiJung! You have to stop the blood!
Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek are focused on Ki-Jung while Dong-Ik and
Yon-Kyo can’t look away from Da-Song. An agonizing moment for
both families. No one moves until -Kun-Sae throws Ki-Jung on the ground and makes a dash for
Chung-Sook. People scream, scatter.
Chung-Sook turns the grill over, spilling charred meat and
firewood over Kun-Sae. Smoke creates a temporary screen.
When Kun-Sae comes through the smoke, Chung-Sook quickly
snatches his wrist, pulling him into a vicious fight.
Ki-Tek heaves his toy axe at Kun-Sae as he runs toward the
fight. It misses Kun-Sae and instead bounces off Chung-Sook’s
head.
Meanwhile Dong-Ik jumps over the wounded Ki-Jung and sprints
toward Da-Song. He picks up the spasming child and runs back
through the crowd toward Yon-Kyo.

127.
Chung-Sook and Kun-Sae go at each other in the middle of the
garden like two predators. Ki-Tek comes to help but can’t find
a way to squeeze between them.
He goes to Ki-Jung and tries to stanch the blood. It won’t
stop. He looks for something to tie her with, but there’s
nothing around. Everyone is busy fleeing, and no one stops to
help.
Help!

KI-TEK
Please help us!

Dong-Ik gives Da-Song to Yon-Kyo, who barks furiously at KiTek.
YON-KYO
Mr. Kim, get the car! We can’t
wait for an ambulance!
Kim!

DONG-IK
Get the car!

YON-KYO
Fifteen minutes!
Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo scream frantically at Ki-Tek as he
desperately tries to stop the blood from Ki-Jung’s wound.
Yon-Kyo has a crazed look. Her maternal instinct has been
kicked up to 11. She doesn’t care that Ki-Jung is dying or
that two deranged people are fighting in her garden.
Dong-Ik can’t wait anymore.
Keys!

He yells at Ki-Tek.

DONG-IK
Give me the keys!

At that moment -We see the hell breaking loose in the garden in SLOW MOTION.
Party Guests continue to escape one by one, and only the
‘little people’ are left viciously fighting for their lives.
KI-TEK’S POV -He sees his daughter’s blood dripping between his fingers...
His wife flailing under a man with a knife... Dong-Ik and YonKyo yelling at him... Party Guests running away...
To add to the list of completely fucked-up shit, he sees -Da-Hae walking toward the gate with a bloody and unconscious
Ki-Woo on her back. Bawling her eyes out.

128.
Meanwhile Dong-Ik continues to yell at Ki-Tek -The keys!

DONG-IK (CONT’D)

Ki-Tek removes the car keys from his pocket and hastily throws
them at Dong-Ik. They hit one of the fleeing guests and drop
in the grass.
Kun-Sae and Chung-Sook roll over the keys as they continue
their death match. Kun-Sae picks up the fallen kitchen knife
and stabs Chung-Sook in the arm!
Chung-Sook grabs her arm as she falls into a pile of burning
logs behind her. She screams.
Kun-Sae is not done. He climbs on top of her and raises the
knife to finish her off.
Ki-Tek jumps at Kun-Sae to stop him, but Kun-Sae is too strong.
His rage has endowed him with supernatural strength. He
quickly subdues Ki-Tek and brings the knife up to stab him.
Ki-Tek closes his eyes.
when -Nothing happens?

He braces himself for the final moment

Ki-Tek slowly opens his eyes.

He sees --

A METAL BARBECUE SKEWER deeply plunged into Kun-Sae’s waist.
Kun-Sae can’t even scream. The pain of the hot skewer piercing
his innards is too much.
We see Chung-Sook holding the other end. In between we see
pieces of meat and sausage smoking on the skewer. As ChungSook lets go -Kun-Sae gradually crumbles to the ground.
Ki-Tek’s crazed, red eyes see Dong-Ik running toward him.
Dong-Ik lifts Chung-Sook and searches underneath for the car
keys. No longer the cool, poised CEO. He’s overcome with
fear, panic. He rolls over Kun-Sae and finally locates the
keys when -He smells something and frowns. It’s Kun-Sae’s body odor.
holds his nose at the awful smell.

He

Ki-Tek notices. A fleeting moment, but it triggers something
inside him. Ki-Tek picks up the TOY AXE from the ground and
stalks Dong-Ik.
When Dong-Ik hears Ki-Tek’s footsteps and turns around --

129.
Ki-Tek swings the axe and plants it right between Dong-Ik’s
neck and shoulder!
That’s when we realize -- it’s not a toy. It’s a REAL AXE.
The one the cool guy used to chop firewood for the barbecue.
We’re not sure if Ki-Tek knew it. It doesn’t matter. All that
matters is that it’s stuck deeply in Dong-Ik’s neck.
Yon-Kyo and the Party Guests are too stunned to scream.
Blood spurts from Dong-Ik’s neck as he falls on the grass.
Ki-Tek stares blankly at Dong-Ik.
foot and looks down --

He feels something touch his

It’s Da-Song’s toy axe. The real axe is still in his hands,
dripping with Dong-Ik’s blood.
Yon-Kyo faints with Da-Song in her arms. Everyone in the
garden stops and stares at Ki-Tek, the axe murderer, in horror.
Ki-Tek wakes up from his daze and realizes what he’s done.
He’s horrified. He bolts for the gate. When frightened Guests
jump out of his way, he realizes that he still has the bloody
axe. He throws it away.
Ki-Tek is scared.

As he runs to the gate, he sees --

-- Chung-Sook pressing down Ki-Jung’s chest while fighting
through her own pain. The Foreign Chef is beside her bandaging
her arm.
-- Kun-Sae, bleeding out from his punctured waist, alone and
neglected by the crowd.
-- A FEW MEN trying to stanch Dong-Ik’s blood while calling
911.
-- WOMEN helping up Yon-Kyo and Da-Song.
Ki-Tek leaves the chaos behind and runs out of the gate.

completely random. There’s a pattern. Could it be Morse code?

moving her all the way from the basement. The hole is dug in
front of a large tree.
One scoop at a time, dirt is scattered over Mun-Kwang’s face.
Ki-Tek stops shoveling and takes a break. He leans on the tree

He sees a FAMILY PORTRAIT hanging on the kitchen wall. A
GERMAN FAMILY OF FOUR, white teeth shining brightly through
their broad smiles. There are more pictures on the
refrigerator. One picture shows a FILIPINO MAID with her arms
around the family’s kids.
KI-TEK (V.O.)
The parents both work, and the

unfortunately they have a live-in

hits his face. Inside we see -Tofu, sausage, Korean gochujang paste, Japanese natto beans...

Luckily, Germans don’t only eat

Ki-Woo is at the mansion. The one that at different points
belonged to the Parks, the German family, and Namgoong Hyunja.
