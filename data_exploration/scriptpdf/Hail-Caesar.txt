WHITE SHOOTING: October 13th, 2014
BLUE REVISION: January 5th, 2015

FADE IN SOUND
INT. CONFESSIONAL - NIGHT
DISTANT, BEAUTIFUL VOICES
Male voices. A Gregorian chant.
We fade in on a crucifix in the apse of the church: a
suffering Christ.
We cut to a close shot of a small silver cross on a rosary.
The rosary is held in a man's lap next to a mouse-grey
fedora. The light is dim.
As we hear a panel sliding, more light wipes onto the rosary
beads.
Wider on the man waiting in the confessional: middle-aged,
tired.
VOICE
Son, it is so late.
MAN
Yeah, Father, work has just been...
VOICE
You work too hard.
MAN
Nah, I’m just... keepin the place
goin’. Anyhow, bless me, Father,
for I have sinned. It’s been uh,
twenty-four hours since my last
confession. I, uh...
VOICE
Yes my son.
MAN
I lied to Connie. Uh, to my wife.
VOICE
This is very serious.
MAN
I know! I promised her I'd quit
smoking. She thinks it's bad for
me. And I'm trying, but... well, I
snuck a couple of cigarettes...
Maybe three.

2.

Yes.
It’s hard.

VOICE
MAN

VOICE
Yes, my son.
MAN
——But I’m trying.
A clap of thunder.
EXT. SPANISH HOUSE - NIGHT
HOUSE AT NIGHT
We are looking, through the rain-pelted windshield of a
parked car, at a small, Spanish-style bungalow. The rattle of
driving rain does not quite cover the sound of drunken female
laughter. There are occasional flashes of lightning outside,
and occasional flashes of strobe light in the windows of the
house.
Inside our surveilling car a wrist rolls over to show a watch
face, streaked with the shadows of dripping rain: 5:00
o’clock.
A voice-over begins, authoritatively omniscient——or maybe it
only sounds so because it is British-accented:
VOICE-OVER
It is 5:00 A.M. The sun is soon to
rise. But for Eddie Mannix the day
has already begun.
Our car’s driver, Eddie Mannix——the man we saw
confessing——looks up from his watch to the house.
VOICE-OVER (CONT’D)
The movie studio for which he works
manufactures stories——each its own
daylit drama, or moonlit dream.
Flash of lightning, crash of thunder, another bout of
laughter from the house.
Eddie Mannix reaches for his door.

3.
OUTSIDE
Eddie Mannix emerges from his car——a Packard marking the
period as circa 1950. Eddie pulls down his hat brim, turns up
his collar, and digs hands into coat pockets as he strides
through the rain.
The strobe light flashes inside the house. The laughter grows
louder as we approach.
Eddie Mannix hesitates only momentarily at the front door. He
tests the knob: unlocked; turns it, enters.
VOICE-OVER (CONT’D)
But the work of Eddie Mannix cares
not for day or night... and cares
little for his rest.
INT. SPANISH HOUSE - NIGHT
On Eddie Mannix at the open door, rain dripping from his
fedora, thunder crashing behind him. His eyes narrow in
distaste.
In the living room a giggling blonde in a milkmaid’s dirndl
with overloaded bodice bends over a butter-churn.
A man with his back to us is peering through a box camera.
MAN
That’s right, darlin’, a little
lower...
The giggling girl sees Eddie Mannix and stops churning.
GLORIA
Oh, fer——ecce homo! You, here?!
The photographer turns to face Eddie: a tall weedy-looking
man with a thin mustache. A sheen of sweat on his brow and
upper lip.
EDDIE
The studio has a right to Gloria’s
likeness, Falco. Gimme the
negatives and things’ll go easier.
FALCO
You got it all wrong, Eddie! This
is f’private use!
Eddie Mannix strides to the camera, pops its back, and pulls
out a length of film.

4.

Hey!

FALCO (CONT’D)

We hear approaching sirens. Falco reacts, bolting for the
back door.
GLORIA
Can’t a girl take a few pitchas,
have a few laughs? Cheez, Eddie,
what a old stick-in-the-mud!
She giggles.
Whap! He slaps her.
She looks at him, stunned, then starts weeping.
He slaps her again.
Outside the sirens wind down and we hear car doors open.
EDDIE
Now you listen to me. You were at a
party, you had too much to drink,
somebody brought you here, you
don’t remember who. You’re going
home now and your name is Mary Jo
Scheinbrotte.
She blubbers:
GLORIA
Okay, Eddie.
The front door opens and two uniformed cops enter.
COP ONE
Hello, Mannix, saw your heap
outside.
COP TWO
Got a call. Loud, disorderly...
He looks around, sniffs.
... Possible French postcard
situation.
EDDIE
Someone was pulling your leg. Mary
Jo here was just at a costume
party. It’s not really her dirndl.

5.
He fishes a wad from his pocket and peels off some bills.
... She wants to contribute
something to your pension fund.
Sorry to drag you out in the rain.
COP ONE
Well, say, no trouble at all.
Cop Two is looking hard at the girl.
COP TWO
Aren’t you Gloria DeLamour?
GLORIA
No no, I'm Mary Jo... somethin'.
EDDIE
Scheinbrotte. Look, Brian...
Eddie hesitates, looking at one of the cops who is smoking.
We hear, distantly but growing louder, a deep thumping sound.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Can I, uh... bum a cigarette?
The thumping sound has grown closer: the tramp of many
marching feet. A fanfare on ancient horns as we cut to:
EXT. THE OLD APPIAN WAY - DAY
Down the road a Roman legion marches in brilliant
Technicolor, the sound of its stamping feet bridging the cut.
Cypress trees, regularly planted, stretch along either side
of the road to the horizon. The title of the movie fades into
superimposition:
HAIL, CÆSAR!
A Tale Of The Christ
The same voice that started the movie now intones:
VOICE-OVER
Ancient Rome! Twelve years into the
rule of Tiberius, Rome’s legions
are masters of the world, the stomp
of its sandals heard from the
Iberian peninsula in the west
through the halls of the great
library of Alexandria in the east!
(MORE)

6.
VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
As oppressed people everywhere
writhe under the Roman lash...
The regularly formed legions in the van now give way to the
slaves being whipped along in the rear:
... master and slave, freeman and
vassal, are united in one
compulsory worship: the emperor,
Cæsar, is Godhead——lord of every
man’s body and spirit! For those
who will not submit, the galleys,
the arenas, even crucifixion await!
But there is a new wind, blowing
from the east, from the dusty
streets of Bethlehem, that will
soon challenge the vast house of
Cæsar——that edifice wrought of
brick and blood which now seems so
secure!
A chariot rolls into the foreground. Its driver is a muscular
campaign-hardened man with Roman bangs. Beneath his copper
breastplate he glistens with manly sweat. He wears a helmet
topped by a bright red mohawk bristle, something like an
upside-down floorwaxer. He is Autolochus Antoninus. He gazes
off and smiles.
Another man gallops up on horseback and reins in next to him.
This is Gracchus Gregorius, and he too wears the floorwaxing
headwear of the Roman tribune.
AUTOLOCHUS
There she is, Gracchus. And ah,
what a beauty!
GRACCHUS
Aye, Autolochus! Rome! Suckled by a
she-wolf and nurturing us her sons
in turn.
AUTOLOCHUS
Tonight I bathe in Caracalla, and
wash away the dust of three hundred
miles of Frankish road! To Rome! To
Rome!
As he whips the chariot horses into motion we pan off to
reveal the hilltop view of Rome before which the weary
tribunes had halted.

7.
VOICE-OVER
Yes, to Rome! Glorious center of
Cæsar’s rule!
EXT. PALESTINE - NIGHT
A rutted rural road. A man in sandals and simple peasant garb
and using a gnarled walking staff walks through rain, thunder
and lightning.
VOICE-OVER
But far away, in Palestine...
INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY
We are panning off the image to reveal that we have been
looking at a screen in a small screening room.
VOICE-OVER
... another man is coming home.
Saul, humble merchant of Tarsus, is
about to be struck down by a
vision.
The continued pan brings us onto the screening room’s one
occupant, Eddie Mannix. After a quick furtive look
around——meaningless since he is alone——he takes a cigarette
from the ashtray next to him and sneaks a puff.
SAUL (off)
(quavering)
What thing is this?
EXT. CAPITOL BACKLOT - DAY
Eddie Mannix strides across the great studio backlot where
technicians mill and actors dressed in the wardrobe of
different ages and genres lounge. His secretary Natalie
follows at his elbow, struggling to keep up as she consults a
notepad:
NATALIE
——and Gloria DeLamour has been
checked into Our Lady of Perpetual
Rest to dry out. You have a 10:00
A.M. with Monsignor O’Reilly at the
Wallace Beery Conference Room. He’s
bringing Lester Silkwood from the
Legion of Catholic Decency and
we’ve also invited Patriarch
Vlassos for the Eastern view.

8.
EDDIE
They’ve read the script?
Roger.

NATALIE

EDDIE
Let’s also invite a rabbi, and a
Protestant padre of some sort so we
can get everybody’s two cents.
Check.

NATALIE

EDDIE
How’s production on “Tucumcari!”?
NATALIE
Principal is on schedule but second
unit has been idle in Gallup, New
Mexico for four days. Heavy rain.
Forecast?
Not good.

EDDIE
NATALIE

EDDIE
Hnn. Send an insert truck and have
‘em shoot driving plates for “Came
the Rain.”
Check.

NATALIE

EDDIE
“Jonah's Daughter” still behind?
NATALIE
Yes, director says the problem is
DeeAnna and she’s getting worse.
EDDIE
I know what it is, I’ll drop in on
her after my ten o’clock.
(pulls back his sleeve to
look at his watch)
All right, let’s call New York.
INT. EDDIE’S OFFICE - DAY
Eddie is on the phone.

9.
VOICE
Nick Schenk’s office.
EDDIE
Hi, Dorothy, Eddie Mannix. The old
man in?
VOICE
Hi, Mr. Mannix, I’ll check.
Eddie raises his voice:
EDDIE
Natalie, I want the box office on
“The Debonaires” and on “Blessed
Event.” Can you also——
Hastily into the phone:
EDDIE (CONT’D)
——Yes, good morning Mr. Schenk...
Very well, thank you. Proceeding...
Proceeding... “Merrily We Dance”
starts shooting today. Beardley
Auberon gave us a draft that’s
extremely classy. Joan Van Vechten
is playing Dierdre, but we need a
male lead and we need him now...
No, Jack Hogarth is drying out at
Cedars... Metro won’t lend us Gable
unless we give them the Comiskey
Twins... Of course not, I agree...
Swell idea but he’s waiting out a
divorce in Reno... Whuh——Hobie
Doyle?! Do you really think so?
After all he’s——he’s a dust actor!
The man barely knows how to...
talk!... Yes, of course, Mr.
Schenk, I agree, but I don’t know
if Hobie Doyle, if he has the uh
the uh the uh poise in a dinner
jacket... Yes, we do need someone
pronto... No I don’t. That’s very
true. Let me talk to Laurence
Laurentz, the director. It could
work. Hobie is a very promising
idea.
EXT. WESTERN LANDSCAPE
A BOULDER
It is a great big boulder.

10.
A beard-stubbled cowboy rises from behind its cover to fire
his six-shooter. He himself is immediately shot: he grimaces
and releases his gun which swivels around his trigger-finger,
as he staggers——and drops.
He who just shot him: Hobie Doyle, in white Western wear.
Eyes narrowed, he gauges the effect of his shot, then reacts
to the sound of retreating hoofbeats.
The other bad men are racing off, firing wildly back in his
direction.
Hobie adroitly twirls and holsters his gun.
Whitey!

HOBIE

The white horse placidly cropping the grass several yards
away flicks its ears and looks over. It nickers and shuffles
to face away from Hobie as he runs to it. He vaults its rump
and man and animal are off.
Hobie riding. A mounted bad man falls in behind him——a
bushwack. This pursuer begins to fire.
Hobie rocks forward on Whitey, low to his neck. He reaches
down to grab the saddle, one hand on either side. He pushes
himself up into a handstand atop the racing horse.
An oncoming tree limb hooks his knees and he swings up and
around as his horse races on unridered. When he loops back
around the tree limb his six-shooter is at the ready and he
fires on the swing at the oncoming horseman. The bad man
clutches his chest and falls from his horse as Hobie swings
up again.
Hobie uses his upward inertia to gracefully execute a trapezeartist dismount from the branch. His drop toward the ground
is neatly intercepted by the bad man’s galloping horse, Hobie
plops into its saddle. He reins in the snorting beast and as
it rears he fires his six-shooter into the air in an
expression of pure brio. He then twirls and holsters his gun,
calms the horse with a pat on the neck, and leaps aground. He
claps dust from his yoked white shirt.
And cut.

MEGAPHONE VOICE

A man in sunglasses rises from a canvas chair next to a
camera attended by men in creased hoist-up pants and white
shirts and ties.
DIRECTOR
Great, Hobie.

11.
HOBIE
I kin do the handstand smoother if
ya gimme another shot atter.
DIRECTOR
We’ve got four good ones Hobie, and
Whitey is tired.
An assistant trots up to Hobie with a small tin. Hobie takes
it and loads a chew into one cheek.
HOBIE
Okay, you’re the bossman. If that’s
lunch ammo grab me a plate a beans.
ASSISTANT
Hobie, the studio wants you to
escort Carlotta Valdez to your
premier tonight.
HOBIE
But she warn’t in the pitcher.
ASSISTANT
Well that’s what they want.
HOBIE
But she warn’t in the pitcher.
ASSISTANT
Well, it’s some publicity thing.
HOBIE
Ah don’t git it.
ASSISTANT
Well, the studio says you’re
bringing Carlotta Valdez. You’re
her escort.
HOBIE
But she’s Carlotta Valdez. Hit
don’t make sense. She warn’t in the
pitcher.
ASSISTANT
Who was in the picture?
Hobie thinks.
Whitey.

HOBIE

12.
ASSISTANT
Well Eddie Mannix says you're
escorting Carlotta Valdez. Guess
they’re changing your image.
INT. COURTYARD OF SESTIMUS AMYDIAS - DAY
ROMANS
They sit in the courtyard of a Roman villa——several togaed
senators and their robed wives——on chairs carved of cedar and
draped with fine silks.
Incongruous entrance: a man in sunglasses wearing a white
open-necked shirt.
He looks here and there. He raises a megaphone.
1ST A.D.
All right, kids, it’s Rome, you’re
over at this guy’s house for a
revel, and here comes Antoninus.
Llllots of energy!
Roll ‘em.

VOICE

A short, togaed extra holding a lyre lurks by a tabletop on
which sits platters of succulent feastings, and one goblet. A
furtive look around.
A.C. VOICE
Camera speed.
BOOM VOICE
Sound speed.
The extra produces a cellophane packet from the folds of his
toga. After another quick glance around he opens the packet’s
flap and taps its powdery contents into the goblet.
He hastily crumples the packet and exchanges a significant
look with:
Another extra, holding a turkey leg nearby. This man is bald
with fringe hair upcombed to make corner hair-vees.
The first extra is startled by:
1ST A.D.
What’re you doing at the table of
viands?!

13.

... Huh?

EXTRA

1ST A.D.
You’re supposed to be reclining,
with the lyre!
EXTRA
Yeah, sorry, I uh——
1ST A.D.
Recline with the lyre!
Yes, sir.

EXTRA

VOICE
We set there? Background set?
1ST A.D.
Don’t sit on the pediment! Recline!
Relaxed, festive!
Yes sir.

Set!

EXTRA

1ST A.D.
(projecting)

(narrows his eyes and
points at the extra now
reclining, hissing as he
leaves)
I got my eye on you.
Fountain!

VOICE

Water starts to gurgle as the courtyard fountain comes to
life.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Background!
The extras talk among themselves in pantomime, displaying
Roman gaiety and deep involvement in their silent
conversations. Some sip at goblets, some nibble at rich
comestibles. Occasionally, a guest tips his head back for a
peal of silent laughter.
Our extra strums his lyre not in pantomime but sounding it,
the same arpeggio, over and over again, separated by the same
beat of silence.

14.
DIRECTOR
And action!
Autolochus strides in. A senator rises to greet him.
SENATOR
Autolochus! I had heard rumors of
your return to Rome!
We are close on the reclining extra with the lyre.
Autolochus, standing before him, is only a pair of foreground
feet in sandals with leather lace-ups twining the calves. The
leather creaks as he talks:
AUTOLOCHUS
More than rumors, noble Sestimus!
The reclining extra looks steeply up at Autolochus. His pointof-view shows Autolochus mostly backlit; we see off the set
and up into the greens.
Autolochus, with great aplomb, swipes the goblet from the
table.
I see that you are the same
worshipper of Bacchus. What gaiety!
There is still truth in the adage,
“What pleasures cannot be found in
the villa of Sestimus Amydias,
cannot be found in Rome!”
(brings the goblet to his
lips but stops with a
thought)
But seriously. There is talk that
the Senate will send our legions
out again——and this time not on a
short march to Gaul. What truth to
these mutterings, Sestimus?
The reclining extra and the extra with the turkey leg
exchange a worried look.
SESTIMUS
The matter is to be taken up in the
Senate. It seems that there is
unrest in Palestine.
AUTOLOCHUS
Palestine! That backwater! They’ll
hardly be sending the Sixth Legion
to that godforsaken patch of
desert!

15.
Hearty male laughter. Autolochus ends his laugh and raises
the goblet to his lips.
Just before drinking——he is taken by another gust of
laughter.
The two extras exchange a look. The reclining extra hugs his
lyre and worriedly arpeggiates.
When Autolochus’s second access of laughter peters out he
raises the goblet again——and now takes a long draught.
DIRECTOR
Holding for a dissolve... still
laughing... holding... and... cut.
Autolochus lowers the goblet, panting, and wipes meadfoam
from his mouth with an armful of sleeve.
The extras too relax.
The director enters: Sam Stampfel, of manly middle-age.
STAMPFEL
Fine, boys, that was fine. We’ll
move on to the brasier scene.
AUTOLOCHUS
Yeah? Was I okay on “What truth to
these mutterings?” I felt a
little——
STAMPFEL
Nah, fine, we move on. Brasier
scene, twenty minutes.
AUTOLOCHUS
Popping over to my dressing room.
(to Script Supervisor)
Got the pages for the brasier
scene?
The Script Supervisor points to a spot on the page as he
hands it over.
SCRIPT SUPERVISOR
They changed “passion” to “ardor.”
AUTOLOCHUS
What? I liked passion. It’s strong.
“Passion.”
The Script Supervisor shrugs a what-can-I-tell-you?
Autolochus wanders off, muttering:

16.
AUTOLOCHUS (CONT’D)
Not so, Ursulina... My ardor is yet
as warm as the embers of this
brasier...
The extra with the lyre exchanges another look with the bald
extra. He indicates with a jerk of the head that they should
follow Autolochus who, as he examines his script, is crossing
the long dark expanse of soundstage, toward a distant glowing
exit sign.
EXT. CAPITOL BACKLOT - DAY
Outside now, the short extra cautiously leans and cranes to
peek around a soundstage corner. The bald extra is next to
him.
His point-of-view: huge stucco soundstages range into the
distance. The only person about is a small receding
Autolochus Antoninus, his sandals scuffing the road and sword
banging his thigh as he walks. He still looks at the script;
we hear his distant muttering:
AUTOLOCHUS
Such is my greeting after three
months’ sojourn in Gaul?... Not so,
Ursulina... My ardor is yet as warmHe stops momentarily, swaying. He extends a hand to steady
himself against the exterior wall of a soundstage. After a
moment, he moves on, somewhat uncertainly.
EXT. BAIRD’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
A STAR ON A DRESSING ROOM DOOR
A slow pull back reveals the name above the star: BAIRD
WHITLOCK.
Muffled, from within, we hear Autolochus/Baird Whitlock:
BAIRD
Not so, Ursulina. My ardor is yet
as warm as the embers of this
brasier... The embers of thish
brasier... Goddamn, that’s tough.
Yet as warm as the embersh of this
brasier... Not so, Urshulina...
The continuing pull back reveals the two extras standing
either side of the door. The bald one nods at the short one.

17.
At the nod, the short extra knocks.
SHORT EXTRA
They’re ready for you, Mr.
Whitlock.
The two men stand tensed.
After a short beat of clomping inside, the door swings slowly
up. Baird stands, swaying, giving the two men a glassy stare.
BAIRD
(slurred)
Not so, Ursulina——
He pitches forward into the ready arms of the togaed men.
INT. CAPITOL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Eddie Mannix strolls and speaks. His audience is a fourperson convocation of clergy sporting different hats, caps,
robes, beards.
EDDIE
Gentlemen, thank you all for
coming. I know you have parishes,
flocks and temples making enormous
demands on your time. But I’m sure
you appreciate also that great
masses of humanity look to pictures
for information and uplift and,
yes, entertainment. Now here at
Capitol Pictures, as you know, an
army of technicians and actors and
top-notch artistic people are
working hard to bring to the screen
the story of the Christ. It’s a
swell story——a story told before,
yes, but we like to flatter
ourselves that it’s never been told
with this kind of distinction and
panache.
EASTERN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH
Perhaps, sir, you forget its
telling in the holy Bible.
A wry smile from Eddie Mannix.
EDDIE
Quite right, Padre. The Bible of
course is terrific.
(MORE)

18.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
But for millions of people,
pictures will be their reference
point for the story——the story’s
embodiment...
(groping)
the story’s...
MINISTER
Realization.
Eddie points an aiming finger at the Minister, saluting his
choice of words.
EDDIE
Realization.
RABBI
You “realize,” of course, that for
we Jews, any visual depiction of
the Godhead is most strictly
prohibited.

Oh.

EDDIE
(dismayed)

RABBI
But of course, for us, the man
Jesus Nazarene is not God.
EDDIE
(brightening)
Ah-ha.
MINISTER
Who plays Christ?
EDDIE
A kid we’re all very excited about,
Todd Hocheiser, wonderful young
actor we found in Akron, Ohio, in a
nationwide talent hunt. But
Hocheiser is seen only fleetingly,
and with extreme taste; our story
is told through the eyes of a Roman
tribune, Autolochus Antoninus, an
ordinary man skeptical at first but
who comes to a grudging respect for
this swell figure from the East.
And Autolochus is played by...
He permits himself a satisfied smile.
... Baird Whitlock.

19.
Murmurs of appreciation from the assembled and one low
“that’s-something” whistle.
RABBI
Well, he is certainly a great
talent.
EDDIE
Now Hail, Cæsar! is a prestige
picture, our biggest release of the
year, and we are devoting huge
resources to its production in
order to make it first-class in
every respect. Gentlemen, given its
enormous expense, we don’t want to
send it to market except in the
certainty that it will not offend
any reasonable American, regardless
of faith or creed. Now that’s where
you come in. You’ve read the
script; I wanna know if the
theological elements of the story
are up to snuff.
PATRIARCH
I thought the chariot scene was
fakey. How is he going to jump from
one chariot to the other, going
full speed?
A frozen beat as Eddie frames an answer.
EDDIE
Uh-huh, well, we can look at that.
But as for the, uh, religious
aspect——does the depiction of
Christ Jesus cut the mustard?
PRIEST
The nature of the Christ is not
quite as simple as your photoplay
would have it.
EDDIE
How so, Father?
FATHER
Well, it is not the case simply
that Christ is God, or God Christ.
RABBI
You can say that again! The
Nazarene was not God!

20.
PATRIARCH
He was not not-God.
RABBI
He was a man!
Part God.
Nossir!

MINISTER
RABBI

EDDIE
But Rabbi, we all have a little bit
of God in us don’t we?
Well...

RABBI

PRIEST
It is the foundation of our belief
that God is tri-partite.
EDDIE
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
PRIEST
And Christ is most properly
referred to as the Son of God. It
is the son of God who takes the
sins of the world upon himself so
that the rest of God’s children, we
imperfect beings, through faith,
may enter the kingdom of heaven.
EDDIE
So God is... split?
Yes.

PRIEST

Eddie nods.
... And no!
Eddie frowns.
PATRIARCH
There is unity in division.
MINISTER
And division in unity.
EDDIE
Not sure I follow, Padre.

21.
RABBI
Young man, you don’t follow for a
very simple reason: these man are
screwballs.
(to the others)
God has children? What, and a dog?
A collie maybe? God doesn’t have
children. He’s a bachelor. And very
angry.
PRIEST
He used to be angry!
RABBI
What, he got over it?
MINISTER
You worship the god of another age!
PRIEST
Who has no love!
RABBI
Not true! He likes Jews.
MINISTER
God loves everyone!
PRIEST
God is love.
PATRIARCH
God is who is.
RABBI
This is special? Who isn’t who is?
PRIEST
But how should God be rendered in a
motion picture?
RABBI
God is not in the motion picture!
MINISTER
Then who is Todd Hocheiser?
EDDIE
Gentlemen, maybe we’re biting off
more than we can chew.
(MORE)

22.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
We don’t need to agree on the
nature of the deity: if we can
focus on the Christ, whatever his,
uh, parentage. My question is: is
our depiction fair?
PATRIARCH
I’ve seen worse.
EDDIE
So I can put you in the plus
column, Patriarch?
The Patriarch gives a musing nod. Eddie turns to the
minister.
... Reverend?
MINISTER
There is nothing to offend a
reasonable man.
Father?

EDDIE

PRIEST
The motion picture teleplay was
respectful and exhibited
tastefulness and class.
RABBI
Who made you an expert all of a
sudden?
Eddie turns to the Rabbi.
EDDIE
... And what do you think, Rabbi?
The rabbi shrugs and affects mildness.
RABBI
Eh. I haven’t an opinion.
EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR - DAY
Eddie Mannix emerges, dabbing at sweat.
NATALIE
How’d we do?

23.
EDDIE
Mm. What’s up?
NATALIE
Can’t find Baird Whitlock. He left
the set over an hour ago, said he
was going to his dressing room but
he isn’t there.
EDDIE
Out on a bender? Am I crazy, middle
of the day?
NATALIE
You’re not crazy, but no. I checked
the Til Two, Dan Tana’s, Rusty
Scupper. No soap.
EDDIE
Home, maybe? Called his wife?
Yep.

NATALIE

EDDIE
What’d Laura say?
NATALIE
He’s not home, he’s never home,
he’s a louse, try one of his
chippies.
EDDIE
Called that script girl, what’s her
name——Francie?
Check.

NATALIE

EDDIE
Any of the gals missing from the
set?
Nope.

NATALIE

EDDIE
Well...
(looks at his watch)
Gone an hour? We won’t worry yet.

INT. LINEN TRUCK - DAY
BLACK
Baird Whitlock’s head lolls in the foreground, waggling with
the motion of the vehicle. His body——he is still in wardrobe,
leather skirt and a breastplate over his white
tunic——stretches away into the background: he is laid out,
unconscious, on a paddy-wagon style bench. At the end of the
bench in the background we see, cropped and soft, a goon in a
double-breasted suit, his forearms on his knees, smoking.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - DAY
THE STREET
Hollywood Boulevard. The truck roars by. Its paneled side
says “Al’s Linens.”
EXT. STUDIO GATE - DAY
Hobie Doyle is pulling up in a chauffeured car. The guard
looks in the back window and is surprised to see the Western
star.
GUARD
How ya doing, Hobie.
HOBIE
Lo there, Scotty.
GUARD
They got you shooting on the lot?
HOBIE
Wul, Mr. Mannix pulled me off the
Western, says I’m doin’ a movie on
a soundstage. They built a drawing
room.
GUARD
Ya don’t say.

INT. STAGE / TANK - DAY
UNDER WATER
A bathing beauty in a sequined mermaid suit swims free-armed
but wriggle-tailed, constrained by her fake nether-parts.
From our underwater perspective we hear burbling music.

25.
After a beat of her swimming solo many bodies shoot down into
the water to join the mermaid, entering foreground and
background in headfirst dives that leave bubble-trails. The
beauties swim loops and then wave themselves back up toward
the surface, smiling.
But the mermaid remains. She approaches a foreground sunken
treasure chest. Atop its gold coins sits a silver crown
which the mermaid seems to recognize as her own. She reaches
for it, smiling-but as she does so a shadow travels over her,
near-to-deep. And then great jaws hinge closed behind her,
capturing her-and the lens-in the black belly of a whale.
We linger in black. Water surface slowly emerges from the
black: we are high above the water now, looking straight
down. With our change in perspective the music now blares
undistorted.
In the tank below us the bathing beauties spin in a formation
that goes through constant kaleidoscopic change. In the
center of the circle formed by the beauties a dark shape
begins to resolve itself: something is surfacing amid the
girls.
It is the whale. As it breaches amid the swimmers its
blowhole, directly beneath the lens, spouts. Jetting water
rises toward us.
Something else is rising, borne up by the jetting water: a
sundae-cup coach of sorts. In it rides the mermaid,
triumphantly ascending.
Her ascent ends high, high, high above the tank. The
spouting water recedes but her sundae cup remains magically
suspended in air.
She opens the cup's gate-door and looks down at the water,
far, far below. As a drum roll builds she prepares to dive.
And does dive.
She splashes into the water and is lost from view.
suspenseful hold, on nothing.

A

And now she emerges from the water, rising again, now on a
pedestal and now wearing her silver crown, recovered in what
offscreen neptunian rite who can say.
The mermaid is proud of herself, proud of her crown, proud of
her bathing-beauty minions-but then pride evaporates. Some
internal struggle. She seems to be getting angry.

26.
She yanks off the crown and tosses it away, squalling:
Wardrobe!

MERMAID

The music slows to sludge and stops.
The mermaid flops into the water and splashes awkwardly
toward the side of the tank, her fluke spanking the surface
as cowed bathing beauties make way and an off-mike voice
yells “Cut!”
INT. STAGE - DAY
CLOSE ON MERMAID
A minute later: she is leaned back on a canvas chair, her
face set in a grimace, a gurgle of effort building in her
throat. Two men behind hold her in place, each with an arm
looped over her shoulder and under an armpit.

After a long straining moment:
GAH!

MERMAID

With her cry there is a rubbery thwop-sound of suction giving
way, and we cut to the reverse:
A stagehand staggers back, holding the now freed bottom half
of her scaly mermaid outfit. He tips it backfin-upward and a
little water dribbles out.
The mermaid is now wearing scaly top-half of her outfit only.
Coming from beneath it, below her waist, is a conventional
Catalina swimsuit. She feels tenderly at her stomach as an
assistant director enters.

A.D.
Gas again, ma’am?
MERMAID
MA’AM? MISS? Am I married?
No miss.

A.D.

27.
MERMAID
No. Yeah, sure, gas again.
(Eddie approaches; she
indicates him)
Ask him, he knows. Okay, scram.
EDDIE
How are you, DeeAnna?
DEEANNA
How am I. Wet. And I don’t think
I’ll fit in the fish-ass after this
week.
EDDIE
Well, we should have the water
ballet in the can after tomorrow;
in the nightclub scene wardrobe’ll
have a gown for you that's more...
forgiving. Um... any more thoughts
about who you might marry?
DEEANNA
HAH! Ain't doin' that again! I had
two marriages, and it just cost the
studio a lotta money to bust’em up.
EDDIE
Well we had to have those anulled——
one was to a minor mob figure and——
DEEANNA
Vince was not minor!
EDDIE
And Buddy Flynn was a bandleader
with a long history of narcotic
use.
DEEANNA
Yeah yeah, they were both louses,
yes, and that’s what I’m sayin’. A
third louse ain’t gonnna do me no
good.
EDDIE
We’ve offered you some very
suitable, clean young men.
DEEANNA
Pretty boys, sap, and swishes! You
think if there was some good steady
reliable man I wouldna grabbed him?

28.
EDDIE
Well, what about Ärne Seslum? He is
the father, isn’t he?
Yeah yeah.

DEEANNA

EDDIE
The marriage doesn’t have to last
forever. But, DeeAnna, having a
child without a father would
present a public relations problem
for the studio. The aquatic
pictures do very nicely for us,
and——
DEEANNA
So you strap on the fish-ass and
marry Ärne Seslum!
EDDIE
The pictures do well for all of us.
And it’s a tribute to you: the
public loves you because they know
how innocent you are. Let me see if
Ärne is open to, um... matrimony.
You’re sure he’s the father?
DEEANNA
Yeah yeah. Absolutely. He’s the
father, yeah. Pretty sure.
Eddie has been nodding and making to withdraw. The last
sentence gives him pause but DeeAnna, ready to get back to
work, projects:
... Okay Maxie, bring me my ass
back!
EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
The “Al’s Linen’s” truck rattles by. We hear the crash of
surf.
Up ahead, on the right side of the road is a weathered sign
for “Rudy’s Fish Shack——500 yards.” Just before the sign is a
turn-off to the left, onto an unpaved and rutted road. The
truck makes the left turn.

29.
INT. STAGE / DRAWING ROOM - DAY
People in formal-wear lounge, chatting.
Hobie Doyle enters stiffly in a tuxedo. He tugs at his
collar.
A distinguished-looking man, middle-aged, well dressed but
not in wardrobe, hastens to greet Hobie. He is the director,
Laurence Laurentz.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
My dear boy, you look wonderful,
how do you feel?
HOBIE
Well this here collar is a little
tight.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
No no, nicely fit, looks a marvel,
just takes a little getting used
to. Now you enter here, Hobie,
having just seen Biff’s valise in
the foyer——in spite of Allegra’s
claim that he hasn’t been to the
house.
HOBIE
I’m sweet on Allegra.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Indeed you are.
HOBIE
But I seen Biff’s grip.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Indeed you have. And so here we
find you haunted by unspoken
suspicions.
HOBIE
Haunted. By Biff’s grip.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
By his valise, yes, but then here
is Dierdre,
(indicates actress on
couch who coldly examines
Hobie——a veteran with no
patience for the rookies)
... harboring deep feelings for
you, and sensing opportunity.

30.

Dierdre.

HOBIE

LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Dierdre, yes. So at her
importuning, you join her on the
couch, and conversation ensues.
Hobie is concerned.
HOBIE
(troubled)
So now she’s gonna importune, Mr.
Laurence?
Laurentz.

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

HOBIE
Oh, I’m sorry. She’s gonna
importune? Is that somethin’ I
should, uh, be concerned about——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
She’ll simply ask you to join her
on the couch, is all I mean to say,
and conversation ensues.
HOBIE
Okay, I gotcha.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Very good, very good, let’s try one
shall we?
HOBIE
Sure, I’ll give her a go.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Wonderful, splendid.
(turns away but turns back
with a thought)
The only thing I would suggest is,
before your first line, you respond
to her line with a mirthless
chuckle.
HOBIE
A mirthless chuckle.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Yes, given your unspoken suspicions
about Allegra, a mirthless chuckle.

31.
HOBIE
Okay, Mr. Laurence, I’ll give it
a——
Laurentz.

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

HOBIE
Oh, gosh, I’m sorry, Mr. Laurentz.
I’ll give it a shot.
THROUGH FILM
A clapper-boy ID’s and whacks a slate on “Merrily We Dance.”
Laurence Laurentz’s voice calls “Action!”
Those assembled in the parlor come to life in a pantomime of
civilized conviviality, chatting and laughing.
Hobie enters, an uneasy backward glance referring perhaps to
the unseen grip.
DIERDRE
Oh, Monty! Come join me on the
divan!
Briefest who-me confusion from Hobie. With a quick recovery
he manages a fairly casual saunter to the couch where he
plants himself——not close to Dierdre. She slides over to
close the gap between them, and she is now all warmth and
sympathy. Her voice is musical and upper-crust:
DIERDRE (CONT’D)
It seems Allegra's a no-show, which
is simply a bore, but I can partner
you in bridge.
(reacting to him)
Why the pout?
Gazing at the floor, Hobie gives a short loud laugh that
sounds like a Heimlich-expulsion. A flinch from the actress.
Hobie’s grin abruptly drops, and, still gazing at the floor:
HOBIE
Would that it were sooooo...
simple.
A beat, the actress looking at him, Hobie looking at the
floor.
The beat grows longer... longer...
Voice of Laurence Laurentz: “Cut!”

32.
We cut to Laurence Laurentz sitting in his director’s chair,
mouth slightly open, staring without expression as he tries
to frame his notes.
He abruptly rises and walks into the set to join Hobie.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Very good——wonderful in fact. But
let’s try it a little differently
this time——
Sure.

HOBIE

LAURENCE LAURENTZ
——let’s try, well let’s see, first
of all why don’t we dispense with
the mirthless chuckle.
HOBIE
No mirthless chuckle.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
No, no need, really——it was a bad
idea, bad directorial——my fault,
overthinking the thing.
HOBIE
Well if you say so, but I’m happy
to do another——maybe try her one
more time——I mean if you want that
chuckle I sure wanna give her to
ya——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
No no no, completely unnecessary
under the circumstances, I think
the audience can to that extent
read your thoughts, and will assume
your mirthlessness.
HOBIE
Okay, you’re the bossman, Mr.
Laurence.
Laurentz.

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

HOBIE
Oh, gosh, I’m sorry, Mr. Laurentz——

33.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Also, let’s try, this time,
actually looking at Dierdre as we
speak, looking into her eyes, and
speaking our line with a certain...
ruefulness.
Hobie nods agreement.
HOBIE
Ruefulness, okay.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Yes. Because it’s not so simple.
Not so simple as she suggests.
Okay.

HOBIE

LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Your feelings are not so simple.
HOBIE
Nawsir. Okay.
Splendid.

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

THROUGH FILM
A clapper-boy ID’s and whacks a slate on “Merrily We Dance”
identifying the scene number and Take 2.
Laurence Laurentz’s voice calls “Action!”
Those assembled in the parlor come to life in a pantomime of
civilized conviviality, chatting and laughing.
Hobie enters.
DIERDRE
Oh, Monty! Come join me on the
divan!
Smoothly this time, Hobie joins her on the sofa. When he sits
he is still not close; she slides to him. The same music in
her intonation:
DIERDRE (CONT’D)
It seems Allegra's a no-show, which
is simply a bore, but I can partner
you in bridge.
(reacting to him)
Why the pout?

34.
Hobie looks at her, somewhat shifty-eyed, not comfortable
with the eye contact.
HOBIE
(rueful)
Would that?
(slight beat; sad headshake)
It were soooo... simple.
Voice of Laurence Laurentz: “Cut!”
Hobie looks hopefully to the approaching Laurence Laurentz.
The director, feeling his look, puts on a smile.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Good, very good. Wonderful, in
fact. Let’s try, this time...
He balls a fist and brings it to his mouth and stares at the
floor, thinking.
Hobie waits, gazing up at him.
At length:
LAURENCE LAURENTZ (CONT’D)
All right, let’s try this, your
line, just say it as I say it, say
your line exactly as I’m about to.
Just as I’m about to do.
HOBIE
Sure, okay.
Beat to focus attention, and then:
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
(rueful, and Britishaccented)
Would that it’were so simple.
HOBIE
Would that ih twuuuuuuh, so simple.
Laurence Laurentz stares at him.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
My dear boy, why do you say
that——why do you say, “twuuuuuh”?
HOBIE
Well you said, say it like I say
it.

35.

Yes but——

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

HOBIE
Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Would that it’were so simple.
HOBIE
Would that ih twuuuuuh, so simple.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Would that it’were so simple.
HOBIE
Okay, I’m tryin to do that, Mr.
Laurentz——
Laurence.

LAURENCE LAURENTZ

HOBIE
I thought——um, a minute ago it was
Laurentz——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
We can use Christian names, my good
dear boy. Laurence is fine——
Okay.

HOBIE

LAURENCE LAURENTZ
——just as I call you Hobie. So,
“Would that it’were so simple.”
Trippingly.
HOBIE
Would that it twuuuuh——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
You seem to be lingering, it’s
interminable——
Oh gosh.

HOBIE

LAURENCE LAURENTZ
——I’m wondering when it’ll end, the
“were,” and we shouldn’t have to
wonder, should we, we should be
marching right along to “so
simple”!

36.
HOBIE
Would that ih...
(after hesitating, rushed)
twersasimple. Twersasimple.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Would that it were so simple. Not
“simple!” Just...
(relaxed)
simmple.
HOBIE
Simmmple. Simmmple. Gosh, I can’t
seem to cinch m’saddle up on
this’n, Larry——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Larry! Good God, Christian names,
yes, but not Larry.
EXT./INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
FROM A HIGH BLUFF
We are looking down into a hidden box cove of the Pacific
Ocean, rugged and secluded. Surf pounds into the teeth of
jagged rocks just offshore. Nestled in the canyon just above
the cove’s tiny beach is a modernist octahedral beach house.
The “Al’s Linen’s” truck is parked where the beach road ends
just in front of the house. The goon from inside the truck
now has Baird Whitlock in a fireman’s carry, taking him to
the house’s front door.
We jump down close——the surf louder here——as the goon knocks.
The knock brings furious dog-yapping from inside the house.
We are close on Baird’s head upside-down against the big
man’s back. Just past the two men the door swings open, and
as the big man steps in he turns to negotiate Baird’s body
through the doorway, Baird’s sandaled legs sweeping toward
us.
There are two men waiting inside. The one at the door is
middle-aged, with sad eyes: He is John Howard Herman.
The deeper man is the room is heavy-set, and in a cheap suit
not freshly pressed. Near him, a springer spaniel frantically
spins in place yapping, excited to have visitors.
MAN
Quiet, Engels!

37.
When the goon has passed with his Roman cargo the sad-eyed
John Howard Herman swings the door toward us, filling the
lens.
INT. EDDIE’S OFFICE - DAY
On the other side of Eddie’s desk is producer Walt Dubrow.
DUBROW
Stall?! For how long? What do I
tell the director?
EDDIE
That we’re looking for him. But we
don’t want it in the gossip
columns——Baird on a bender or in a
love nest or wherever we end up
finding him. As far as the set is
concerned it’s business as usual.
Tell the A.D. Baird is out briefly
with a high ankle sprain.
DUBROW
Fine, but what do we shoot without
him? We got the brasier scene up
this afternoon.
EDDIE
Could you get through it shooting
around him?——Maybe use his stunt
double, Chunk Mulligan.
DUBROW
Chunk can’t act.
EDDIE
Get the writer to trim his
speeches.
DUBROW
Well, maybe, but then what? All we
got left is the final
scene——Autolochus’s speech at the
feet of the penitent thief.
Eddie grimaces.
Uh-huh.

EDDIE

DUBROW
It’s the emotional climax of the
entire picture!
(MORE)

38.
DUBROW (CONT'D)
We have to see that Autolochus has
absorbed the message of the Christ!
EDDIE
Yeah, I can see that.
DUBROW
We need Baird’s star power, his
charisma.
A wave of Eddie’s hand communicates the ineffable:
EDDIE
Sure, his emotional, uh——
DUBROW
This can’t be faked! This is the
heart and soul of the picture!
EDDIE
I understand——
DUBROW
End of the movie, we can’t give
that speech to some——some——some
Roman schmoe!
EDDIE
Yeah, yeah I got it. But his
benders can last a day or two——what
does it cost to shut down?
DUBROW
Plenty. You know how big the
picture is, we’re on Stages 5 and
14, if we’re carrying everybody in
the last scene who’s up on
crucifixes that’s three-forty an
hour hardship pay eight hour
minimum——
EDDIE
Yeah yeah.
(his phone buzzes; he
punches the button)
Not now.
DUBROW
——not to mention we lose Todd
Hocheiser to Fox at the end of the
week.

39.
EDDIE
Shoulda made him exclusive; who
knew.
(another buzz from the
phone)
Not now!
NATALIE’S VOICE
It’s Mr. Laurentz, Mr. Mannix! I
can’t stop him!
The door bursts open and Laurence Laurentz storms in. Natalie
has trailed him to the door, where she hovers.
EDDIE
It’s all right, Natalie. Okay Walt,
lemme know——
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Mannix, I won’t have it! For two
decades the name “Laurence
Laurentz” has meant something to
the public!
EDDIE
What’s on your mind, uh...
Laurence?
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Hobie Doyle cannot act!
EDDIE
Hobart Doyle is one of the biggest
movie stars in the world.
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
On horseback! But this is drama,
Mannix——real drama, an adaptation
of a Broadway smash! It requires
the skills of a trained thespian,
not a rodeo clown. I begged you for
Lunt!
Natalie has been hesitant to butt in:
NATALIE
Mr. Mannix, I’m sorry but——you
wanted me to make sure you didn’t
miss your lunch at the Imperial
Gardens. You never told me who
with.

40.
EDDIE
Right.
(looks at watch, grimaces)
Nuts. Look: no one wants to see
Lunt. We’re not recasting; this
came from Mr. Schenk himself: it’s
Hobie Doyle. Is the boy game?
LAURENCE LAURENTZ
Oh, he’s game. And gamey!
EDDIE
If he needs help it's your job to
help him. I’ll have a talk with
Hobie and take a look at what
you’ve shot——but right now I’ve got
a lunch.
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
BLACK
The pounding of surf fades up, the sound close but somewhat
muffled by interior perspective.
We are fading up wide on Baird Whitlock, lying on his back,
still unconscious. He lies on a patio chaise lounge made of
thin plastic tubing stretched across an aluminum frame. We
are in a storeroom, the chaise being the room’s only piece of
furniture.
A muffled ding-dong from the front of the house. We hear the
springer spaniel, stirred by the bell to yapping.
With much plastic-squeaking Baird rolls onto his side and
nestles his head into the chaise’s tubing-upholstery. In his
sleep he murmurs:
BAIRD
What truth to these mutterings,
Sestimus...
He subsides to snoring.
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
MAIN ROOM
The sad-eyed man, John Howard Herman is opening the front
door to several visitors. The first visitor enters: murmured
greetings, solemn handshake. Another man, another sober
handshake.

41.
Then an elderly man in tweeds clutching his pipe, the
greeting for him especially deferential. Then a man with a
briefcase; he sets it down so that he may greet by means of a
hug. He picks up the briefcase, makes way for the next man.
A counter separates the entryway from a small kitchen. In it,
the man we saw shushing the dog when Baird was brought in is
carefully cutting the crusts off of finger sandwiches and
stacking them on a platter.
As the dog yaps in a frenzy of delight at all the visitors,
the man reacts without looking up:
MAN
Quiet, Engels!
INT. IMPERIAL GARDENS - DAY
A gong stings the cut to the interior of this Chinese
restaurant.
Arthur Fung, a grave-looking man in a dark suit and
conservative tie, greets Eddie Mannix.
ARTHUR FUNG
How pleasant to see you, Mr.
Mannix, your table is right over
here.
EDDIE
Thank you, Arthur.
They splash through a curtain of beads to approach a booth at
which another man sits, a drink with an umbrella before him,
an ashtray and an Imperial Gardens matchbook next to it, a
cigarette in his hand. He rises to shake.
MAN
How ya doing, Mannix.
EDDIE
Mr. Cuddahy.
CUDDAHY
Mix a hell of a mai-tai. I like
this place.
The men seat themselves facing each other.
EDDIE
Sorry to keep you hanging——it’s a
tough decision.

42.
CUDDAHY
Nothing to apologize for——we said
the offer was on the table for a
week.
Cuddahy has noted Eddie eyeing his cigarettes. He picks up
the pack and offers with a hitch of the wrist that sends four
cigarettes nosing out of the top of the foil.
Go ahead.

CUDDAHY (CONT’D)

EDDIE
Nah, I’m... I’ve been trying to...
CUDDAHY
The deadline was tomorrow, but,
frankly, we were surprised not to
get a quick yes. I just wanted to
see if there was some impediment we
could help with, or if something in
the offer isn’t clear?
EDDIE
The offer’s very clear. And very
generous.
CUDDAHY
We want to make it easy for you to
say yes. Look Mannix, we need a guy
with your talents in management,
problem-solving. And you need to
think about the future. Lockheed is
booming——it’s reflected in the
offer we made you. Everyone is
riding in airplanes, and we’re
moving into jet airplanes. It’s a
new age, Mannix, and we’re part of
it; the industry you’re in——what’s
the future there? What happens when
everybody owns a television set?
Will they still be going to
pictures every week?
Well, we——

EDDIE

CUDDAHY
I don’t mean to denigrate; I’m sure
the picture business is pretty
damned interesting. But it’s also
pretty frivolous, isn’t it?
Aviation is serious; serious
business, serious people.

43.
CUDDAHY (CONT'D)
You won’t be babysitting a bunch of
oddballs and misfits, shouldering a
lot of crackpot problems from
people who——
EDDIE
Look, we have some kooks, sure——
CUDDAHY
Course they’re kooks, it’s all makebelieve!
(quick grimace and smile;
he leans back)
I told myself I wasn’t gonna
badmouth the competition, and looka
me. Sorry, Mannix, I’ll stick to
what we’re about. Lemme show you
something.
(digs in a pocket)
Ever heard of the Bikini Atoll?
What?

EDDIE

CUDDAHY
It was a test site, couple of rocks
in the South Pacific——till a few
weeks ago. Then we blew the Aitcherino. Not supposed to be telling
you this.
(hands Eddie a picture)
The real world. Hydrogen bomb.
Fusion device.
EDDIE
Armageddon.
CUDDAHY
And Lockheed was there. We had a——
He cuts himself off. A splash of the bead curtain.
WAITRESS
Call for you, Mr. Mannix.
The waitress, in a red embroidered sheath dress, is entering
with a telephone. She plugs it in. As she leans to set it on
the table Cuddahy swipes the picture from Eddie’s hand where
it was exposed to view.
EDDIE
Thank you... Hello?... And he has
it now?... No, have him stay on
set, I’ll go to him.
(MORE)

44.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
(slams down the phone and
rises)
Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.
Still do work there, for the day
anyway.
(grabs his hat, calls back
over his shoulder)
You make a good case. I’ll let you
know.
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
There is a dull clunk and we are close on Baird Whitlock, who
opens his eyes.
Wider: Baird in his centurion’s wardrobe reclining on the
beach chaise. The sound of ocean outside.
The clunk has punctuated an ongoing machine-hum which
continues, cycling louder and softer, its loudest approach
always punctuated by a clunk.
The lawn chair makes tacky noises as Baird disengages from
it. He stiffly sits up. He gazes stupidly about, looking into
the depth of the room: where am I?
He twists to look behind himself, lawn chair crackling, and
does a modest take: out the window is the Pacific Ocean.
Another clunk and receding machine hum. Baird registers the
noise, gets to his feet and walks to the door. It is closed.
He reaches for the knob. He tries the knob. It turns. He goes
through the door.
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
LIVING ROOM
The main room, in which we saw Baird being brought in and the
mysterious visitors entering. It is now empty except for a
middle-aged woman with a bandana tied Aunt-Jemima style on
her head. She vacuums. Each forward pass of the machine ends
with its clunk against the wall.
The woman looks up, and shows no particular interest in Baird
despite his breastplate and leather skirt. She turns off the
vacuum.
WOMAN
You one of the Hollywood people?

45.
Baird stares at her, considering all the possible answers.
Finally:
... Maybe.

BAIRD

WOMAN
They’re in there.
A jerk of her head indicates a hallway. She fires up the
machine again.
Baird looks down the hallway. From one of its rooms, muffled
male laughter.
He goes cautiously down the hall, the vacuum sound fading
away, male voices fading up. One door is ajar. Baird
cautiously bumps it open further.
Another round of laughter is interrupted as all turn to look
at the Roman-attired man in the doorway. Most of the
interrupted party are seated; there are a couple of overflow
standees; several men smoke cigarettes, one smokes a cigar;
the tweedy elderly man is sunk back in an easy chair smoking
a pipe.
The springer spaniel leaps and twists and yaps, excited by
the new arrival.
DOG SHUSHER
Quiet, Engels!
Again, this does nothing to quiet the dog. Baird looks from
man to man. John Howard Herman, the man who greeted the other
arrivals at the door, the apparent host, waves Baird in.
HERMAN
Please! Enter! All are welcome!
Baird cautiously enters. One man vacates a seat for him.
Baird cautiously sits. His scabbard catches on the chair arm,
prompting chuckles from some of the men.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
Those things are a nuisance!
A nearby man leans over to help him adjust it. Baird sits
back.
BAIRD
Thank you. Uh...

46.
The men look to him, waiting for him to bring out his
thought. Herman helps:
HERMAN
Wondering where you are?
Yeah.

BAIRD

The dog has subsided and comes over to sniff at Baird’s
sword.
HERMAN
Malibu. We’ll have sandwiches in a
minute. Tea?
BAIRD
... Tea. Well. Okay. Okay. And...
and——
HERMAN
And what’s going on?
Yeah.

BAIRD

SECOND MAN
Well, we’ve just read the minutes
and Allen was about to bring up new
business.
BAIRD
So... I missed the minutes.
HERMAN
I wouldn’t worry about it.
THIRD MAN
They’re usually pretty boring.
BAIRD
Uh-huh. And——what kind of
meeting——exactly——
HERMAN
Well it’s not a “meeting,” so much
as a, a——what should we say?
BENEDICT
It’s a——more of a, a study group.
BAIRD
And you’re studying... ?

47.
HERMAN
Oh, all sorts of jolly stuff.
History.
Economics.

THIRD MAN
DUTCH

THIRD MAN
Same thing, isn’t it——history,
economics?
HERMAN
Don’t you agree?
All are looking at Baird.
BAIRD
Well... I’m... I’m not really a
student of history.
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
PLATTER OF FINGER SANDWICHES
Someone reaches in to take a sandwich off the offered
platter.
Wider: Baird sits back with the finger sandwich. It is
minutes later and the respectful quiet has now given way to
the relaxed clatter of people eating, laughing, having sideconversations.
BAIRD
Thank you. So man is... split?
HERMAN
Well, man’s functions are split.
There’s the little guy, the regular
Joe, who works for a living. He’s
the body, uh, body politic. Then
there’s the brain——the boss, the
owner——
SECOND MAN
The boss is not the brain!
ANGRY MAN
No no! The boss is parasite!

48.
HERMAN
Well, it’s true that the boss
doesn’t work, but he has a function
in the system——
Baird looks from man to man, as at a tennis match.
He controls the means of——
SECOND MAN
——production, sure, but that’s not
a function, that’s, that’s——
ANGRY MAN
Parasitism! On the body! On the
body politic! Of the regular Joe!
It’s——
A throat clearing.
Everyone instantly quiets. All look to the old man in tweeds
who is just lowering his pipe. Having claimed the floor he
now speaks with non-argumentative authority.
MARCUSE
Man is unitary——a simple economic
agent. Man’s institutions are
split, expressing contradictions
that must be worked through. And
they are worked through in a
causative, predictable way: history
is science. This is the essence of
the dialectic.
Click! A sallow thin young man with heavy beard shadow has
just snapped a picture of Baird. A sickly smile at Baird and
then he turns to face someone else in the room
and——click!——takes a picture.
HERMAN
See, if you understand economics,
you can actually write down what
will happen in the future, with as
much confidence as you write down
the history of the past. Because
it’s science. It’s not makebelieve. Like Professor Marcuse
says. There’s no mystery.
THIRD MAN
We don’t believe in Santa Claus!
Hearty guffaws.

49.
Click! The photographer is edging around the group,
continuing his picture-taking.
HERMAN
Another finger sandwich? More tea?
BAIRD
But if I——sure, thank you——if I
follow this, correctly, you——
(eye caught by man with
camera)
Who’s he?
SECOND MAN
Mr. Smitrovich takes pictures for
our newsletter.
The sallow picture-snapper smiles again at Baird.
MARCUSE
Our understanding of the true
workings of history gives us access
to the levers of power. Your
studio, for instance, is a pure
instrument of capitalism. As such
it expresses the contradictions of
capitalism, and can be enlisted to
finance its own destruction.
HERMAN
Which is exciting! It can be made
to help the little guy, the regular
Joe——
ANGRY MAN
The body politic!
HERMAN
Shutup!——help the little guy, even
though its purpose is to exploit
the little guy.
BAIRD
Okay, so you guys are for the
little guy.
HERMAN
Well——for the little guy,
against——it doesn’t matter, history
will be what it will be, and we
already know what it will be,
but——yes, we’re for the little guy,
aren’t you?

50.
BAIRD
Are you joking? Me, for the little
guy? Of course I’m for the little
guy! Is this guy a comedian?
FOURTH MAN
And you would act. To help the
little guy.
Act?
Praxis.
What?
Act.

BAIRD
FOURTH MAN
BAIRD
FOURTH MAN

BAIRD
Yeah yeah, act yeah, but——sorry
fellas, this is good stuff, but——I
oughta get back to work, they must
be goin nuts——can we cut it off and
pick it up right here at the next
study session?
The clatter subsides to quiet. Cautious looks are exchanged
among the men.
Herman, gazing at Baird and nodding, thinking, finally frames
his opening:
HERMAN
Okay, well, see: I’m afraid it’s
not that simple.
As we cut wide on the room, the same voice that narrated the
sandal epic “Hail, Cæsar!” at the beginning of our movie
returns, distinguished, British-accented, authoritative yet
plummily comforting:
VOICE-OVER
And so Baird Whitlock found himself
in the hands of Communists...
Herman starts to silently explain things to Baird. The scene
of cozy bonhomie is framed by the elemental vastness of the
ocean outside.

51.
VOICE-OVER (CONT’D)
Meanwhile, far from the crashing
surf of Malibu, Eddie Mannix, torn
from his lunch with the Lockheed
man...
EXT. CAPITOL LOT / H.C. STAGE - DAY
A montage of Eddie, a tiny, solitary figure, striding through
the canyons between enormous sand-colored soundstages.
VOICE-OVER
... hurries back to the vastness of
Capitol Pictures, whose tireless
machinery clanks on, producing this
week’s ration of dreams for all the
weary peoples of the world.
Closer on Eddie as he enters the small door of a soundstage.
The light above the door is flashing red.
INT. H.C. STAGE - DAY
INSIDE
High-ceilinged darkness and quiet. A man posted at the door
hisses at Eddie, entering:
MAN
Hey, numbskull, didn’t you see the
“rolling” li——Oh, I’m sorry Mr.
Mannix. Can I help you find
someone?
We have been hearing the distant, echoing voices of two
actors, a hoarse-voiced man and a silken-voiced woman.
Their voices bump up full as we cut to the periphery of the
scene being shot around a great flickering brasier. An actor
in centurion’s wardrobe identical to Baird’s has one hand
half-covering his face as the other arm stretches out as if
to repel the gaze of a revealingly clad slavegirl.
URSULINA
Autolochus! Why do you present
yourself in my chambers in such
humble fashion?

52.
CHUNK MULLIGAN
Do not look upon me, Ursulina. The
fires of the brasier of Sestimus
latterly burned my face, though the
unguents of Arkimideus promise
shortly to undo the damage.
In the foreground Eddie leans in to Walt Dubrow, watching the
scene, and whispers:
EDDIE

Walt.
Eddie!

DUBROW

He fishes a twice-folded paper from his pocket.
Eddie holds it up so that he may read by the flickering gaglight that simulates brasier flames. Typewritten:
We have your movie star.
Gather $100,000 and await
instructions.
Who are We?
The Future.
URSULINA
You know that my love is for you
not for your station, and neither
does it care for the transitory
blemishes that now mark your
visage.
Eddie gives a low whistle at the contents of the note.
CHUNK MULLIGAN
And my ardor for you is yet as warm
as the embersh of thish
bra——goddamnit——this brazher. I’m
sorry, goddamnit.
Cut!

VOICE

EXT. H.C. TEMPLE SET - DAY
OUTSIDE
Eddie and Walt emerge from the soundstage onto an exterior
set with thick temple columns.

53.
DUBROW
Somebody slipped it under my door
some time after we broke this
morning.
EDDIE
Mention it to anyone?
Nope.

DUBROW

Eddie gazes, unseeing, down the row of columns as two workmen
tip the farthest one, striking it.
EDDIE
Okay, let’s keep it that way.
(realizes where he is)
We shot this out?
DUBROW
Chasing the money-lenders from the
temple? Yeah, last Friday.
Eddie nods, thinking.
EDDIE
What do you think they mean, “The
Future”?
Walt answers with a beats-me shrug and headshake. Eddie gazes
back down at the note and moseys off——but turns back with a
bright finger-cock at Walt:
... Chunk sounded good in there!
INT. EDDIE’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
Eddie bangs through a door that says:
EDWARD MANNIX
HEAD OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTION
EDDIE
Natalie, could you please get me
Stu Schwartz, Accounting?
INNER OFFICE
Eddie strides in as the phone on his desk buzzes:

54.
NATALIE’S VOICE
Stu Schwartz on two.
EDDIE
Stu, how are you. I need some petty
cash... Hundred thousand. I’m
sorry, did I say “petty”?...
With the handset shoulder-clamped to his ear he stoops and
pulls on attaché case from the legwell of his desk and places
it on the desktop and pops the clasps and starts emptying it.
... Yeah, well it’s a long story
and I’ll tell it to ya sometime.
You have that much in the
office?... How much space’ll that
take up?... Okay, this might do it.
I’ll be over in a minute.
As soon as he disconnects, Natalie edges into the office.
NATALIE
Thora Thacker just came in, wonders
if you have a moment.
Eddie winces.
EDDIE
Thora Thacker. Tell her I’m stuck
on a call. I’ll leave through the
patio.
EXT. CAPITOL LOT - DAY
As Eddie marches past the executive offices with his emptied
attaché case, a tall red-haired woman arcs in to march
alongside him. He winces.
WOMAN
Call didn’t take so long, then.
EDDIE
Yes——no——fast talker. What can I do
for you, Thora?
THORA THACKER
Well, I'll be fast too. I only
wanted to notify you as a courtesy
that I’m running my story on Baird
Whitlock.

55.
EDDIE
Yeah? What story?
THORA THACKER
The story. I have a credible source
and I’m going to run it, and I
think you know what story I mean.
EDDIE
I have no idea——there’s nothing
going on with Baird——I would know,
wouldn’t I?
THORA THACKER
Don’t play dumb, Eddie, I’m talking
about...
(dramatic pause, dramatic
delivery)
“On Wings as Eagles.”
This stops Eddie in his tracks. He stares at Thora, wide-eyed
and shaken.
Finally:
What?!

EDDIE

She gives him a knowing look and a confirming nod.
THORA THACKER
Running it tomorrow.
EDDIE
First of all——first of all——first
of all——there’s nothing to that
story. I’ve heard it, it’s been
around forever, and it’s never been
confirmed. And secondly——you can’t
print that! Even if you could print
it you couldn’t print it. And you
wouldn’t want to, Thora, it’s
beneath you.
THORA THACKER
The facts are never beneath me.
EDDIE
People don’t want the facts, they
want to believe. That’s our great
industry——mine, and yours too. They
want to believe that Baird Whitlock
is a great star, and a good man.

56.
THORA THACKER
You’re admitting he isn’t.
EDDIE
No, I’m saying he is, though it’s
beside the point. There’s nothing
to it, nothing to the gossip.
THORA THACKER
I AM NOT A GOSSIP COLUMNIST!
EDDIE
No no, of course not——
THORA THACKER
Don’t confuse me with my sister!
EDDIE
Hardly. But look——do you have to
run it tomorrow?
THORA THACKER
It’s my entire column. I’m happy to
talk to Baird for comment, but
it’ll have to be this afternoon.
EDDIE
Baird is unavailable right now.
Wait one day.
A chirping hoot from Thora.
Eddie grimaces and lowers his voice confidentially:
Thora, wait one day and I’ll give
you a true story for tomorrow's
column. A little something——about
Hobie Doyle.
THORA THACKER
My readers don’t care about Hobie
Doyle. He wears chaps.
EDDIE
Do they care about Carlotta Valdez?
They’re sweet on each other. You
should see the two of ‘em together,
peas in a pod.
THORA THACKER
Trade the story of my career for a
puff piece on Hobie Doyle? I don’t
think so.

57.
EDDIE
You’re not trading anything, you’re
waiting one day on a story that’s
years old. Give me a day, I can let
you talk to Baird and show you your
story’s the bunk. And if I’m wrong,
no skin off your nose, you run the
column. In the meantime you have an
exclusive——no one else knows about
Hobie and Carlotta.
Thora eyes him suspiciously.
No one?
You’re it.

THORA THACKER
EDDIE

Eddie treats the deal as done in hopes that that will help
make it so. He smiles at her.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
What kind of name is Thora, anyway?
THORA THACKER
It’s a name that nineteen million
readers trust. Don’t play games
with them, Eddie.
As he starts to trot off, his gesture takes in the entire
studio:
EDDIE
Nobody's playing games here.
INT. STUDIO ACCOUNTING OFFICE - DAY
DESK
Attaché case on top of the desk, bank-wrapped bills stacked
inside.
The top of the case is swung down. The two halves of the case
do not quite meet: too much money inside.
Straining pressure.
Stu Schwartz arches an eye behind horn-rimmed glasses.
STU
Is that big enough?

58.
Eddie strains downward as he presses the two clasps, inward,
until——snap! snap!——they catch.
EXT. CAPITOL LOT - DAY
Eddie Mannix walks through the campus opposite-ways from last
time, the attaché case bulging under one arm.
A woman arcs in to walk with him——a tall, red-haired woman,
Thora Thacker it seems, except that her dress is different.
Eddie, as when ambushed earlier, fights to conceal surprise
and dismay.
WOMAN
Hello Eddie, I'm notifying you as a
courtesy before I run tomorrow’s
story.
EDDIE
Hello, Thessaly, I just saw——never
mind, what’s up? What’s the story?
THESSALY THACKER
It’s about Baird Whitlock.
EDDIE
There is absolutely no truth to
that old story, believe me!

Old?

THESSALY THACKER
(puzzled)

EDDIE
Old! Stale! Rotten! And——
THESSALY THACKER
I’m talking about today.
EDDIE
And there’s——
(abrupt shift from heated
to cagey)
What?
THESSALY THACKER
A little bird told me he
disappeared from the set today.
EDDIE
Oh! That. No no. Yes, he did have
to take a break. Minor injury, high
ankle sprain.

59.
THESSALY THACKER
What did you think I mean?
EDDIE
No, nothing. I saw your sister
earlier, she was trying to
resurrect some old gossip about
Baird.
THESSALY THACKER
I’m sure she was. That cow. She
couldn’t find a new story if it
were taped to her posterior.
EDDIE
Well, she’s——
THESSALY THACKER
High ankle sprain? That’s the best
you could come up with? We all know
about the drinking jags and the
womanizing and the trips to San
Bernardino.
EDDIE
Baird is a good family man. He has
a high ankle sprain.
YOUNG MAN’S VOICE
Mr. Mannix!
A freckled youth in a cardigan sweater is bicycling up the
walkway. As he furiously pedals, a Capitol Pictures pennant
snaps and flutters from a high antenna off the back fender.
He skids to a halt, close.
EDDIE
What’s up, Peanut?
PEANUT
Natalie told me to find you PDQ! I
know it sounds screwy but she said
someone's calling from the future!
EDDIE
The——good lord! Thessaly, I have to
run.
THESSALY THACKER
If you do know where Baird is, let
me talk to him.
Eddie Mannix is already hastening off.

60.
EDDIE
Sure——well, I’ll——find out where he
is, right away, Thessaly, I’m sure
he’ll——
(turns with a thought)
Say, what kind of name is Thessaly,
anyway?
THESSALY THACKER
It’s a name that twenty million
readers trust. They want the truth,
Eddie.
On his hasty retreat:
EDDIE
Truth, yes! We're gonna give it
to'm!.
He jogs off with the bulging attaché case clamped to his
side, led by Peanut on his bicycle with its fluttering
pennant.
INT. EDDIE’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
Eddie strides through the outer office.
NATALIE
On two! And Hobie Doyle is in
there.
Right.

EDDIE

INNER OFFICE
Hobie, in dinner jacket, rises from the chair facing the
desk.
HOBIE
Lo, Mr. Mannix.
As he rushes around the desk to the phone and puts down
attaché case:
EDDIE
Thanks for coming, Hobie, one
second. Mannix here, who——Damn!
He looks at the handset he has picked up, shakes his head,
cradles it. He hits a button on the phone.

61.
... Hung up, Natalie. Tell me the
second they call back.
Yes, sir.

NATALIE

Eddie looks darkly down at the attaché case.
HOBIE
‘T’s goin’ on there, Mr. Mannix,
looks like you're expectin’ rain.
EDDIE
Nah, it’s——nothing. How’s the first
day on the picture? Getting
comfortable?
Eddie is still looking down at the bulging attaché case. He
pushes experimentally down on the middle of its buldge. He
pops the clasps. He redistributes the currency
inside——blocked from Hobie’s view by the case itself——as
Hobie talks.
HOBIE
Oh, I guess it’s goin’ purt good,
that Mr. Lau——er, Laurentz, he’s an
awful good man he’s helpin me get
through it, I give him all the
credit in the world, me the new
hand in the bunkhouse, they got me
talkin; a lot which takes a little
gettin’ use to, talkin’ with the
camera lookin’ at me but heck I
enjoy.
EDDIE
Good, that’s fine.
HOBIE
Usually on a picture I just say
“Whitey!” Or “Whoa, there,” but
this-here it’s talkin’ an’t’s
people listenin’, threw me little
at first but I think I got my leg
up onner now.
Eddie has closed the case again and does the clasps. He
assesses its shape as he talks to Hobie:
EDDIE
Well that’s fine. Laurence came in
this morning to tell me how well
you’re doing, he’s very impressed.
(MORE)

62.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
You just continue to do whatever he
says. He knows how to make a
quality picture.
HOBIE
Oh that is true, he will not quit
on a take until it has quality——
The phone buzzes.
EDDIE
Hang on, Hobie.
(punches the intercom
button)
That them?
NATALIE’S VOICE
Sorry, sir——no, do you want Mrs.
Mannix on one?
He deflates; picks up the phone.
EDDIE
Hi hon... Oh, you know——busy... Uhhuh... Uh-huh... But I thought he
asked to play infield... I see...
Well, maybe we should make him
honor that commitment...
He has reopened the case and is rearranging the money.
... Well that’s true——Of course,
you’re right. Okay, okay, I’ll call
the coach... Sure. Love you too.
He hangs up.
HOBIE
Mr. Mannix, should I run out’n get
you a bigger grip? That’n looks a
little snug.
Eddie looks up at Hobie and focuses on him for the first
time. A long, appraising look.
Hobie returns the look, not sure what it means.
Finally:
EDDIE
Hobie: there’s a hundred thousand
dollars in that attaché case.
(MORE)

63.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Ransom money. Baird Whitlock has
been kidnapped.
Hobie stares, shocked. Eddie Mannix nods a grim confirmation.
Finally:
HOBIE
Well, this is bad. Bad for movie
stars ever’where.
Eddie’s mouth forms a moue of agreement.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
And you got no idea who’s mixed up
in this thang?
Eddie gives a wagging headshake.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
I would look at the extries.
EDDIE
The extras. Why?
HOBIE
Well you just never know about an
extrie. They come’n go. Everyone
else, I’m on the set, I look at the
guy settin’ the 5K I think, “Why
there’s old Bud, settin the 5K.”
Script girl, wrangler, same thang.
Extries, that’s diffurnt. Not
makin’ a blanket call here——there’s
good extries’n bad extries. All I’m
sayin: you look at an extrie, you
got no idea what he’s thankin’.
Eddie stares at Hobie, contemplating.
The silence is broken by the buzz of his phone. Natalie’s
voice comes through the unit:
NATALIE’S VOICE
He’s back——line one.
EDDIE
Hello!... Yes, I have it... Stage
8?... Right. Just leave it there?
And when do I get Baird?... I’ll do
it right now.
He hangs up, looks at the case, looks at Hobie.

64.

Can I use your belt?
INT. WATERFRONT BAR - DAY
We are coming off the lettering on the side of a boat which
identifies it as “The Swingin’ Dinghy.”
Our move reveals that behind the boat which is suspended by
two chains like a lifeboat is a backbar in the middle of
which is a clock, just now striking twelve. We move down off
the clock to find a bartender looking up at it. A dishrag is
draped over his shoulder, a well-chewed cigar stub is planted
in his mouth.
BARTENDER
The Swingin’ Dinghy is closin’,
folks. Time for me to clean up,
time for you to clear out.
He moves to get a broom. On his move we widen out to show the
bar’s clientele: about a dozen sailors and their dates, five
or six young women. The boat of which this establishment is
namesake is a quarter-size model hanging over the bar.
The girls are mounting the stairs to leave the cellar bar.
One turns back with a farewell:
GIRL
So long, fellas! See ya in eight
months!
The morose sailors all gaze up at the departing girls. The
bartender asks one sailor:
BARTENDER
Eight months?
He is addressing a sailor whose glum look stays on the
exiting girls. The look lingers on the door after it closes
behind them. The sailor sighs.
SAILOR
Yeah——we’re shippin’ out in the
mawnin.
Another sailor, seated on the stool of a piano near the
stairs, is also looking glum.
SAILOR 2
Golly: eight months without a dame.
The lead sailor, equally downcast, is played by Burt Gurney.

65.
BURT
Can ya beat it.
BARTENDER
(gruff)
Yer gonna have to beat it.
Visible through a high window-well which gives onto the
sidewalk are the gams of a girl who has stopped to adjust the
seam of one stocking.
Burt, gazing yearningly up at the legs, starts to sing:
BURT
Oh, we’re headin’ out to sea...
The production number “No Dames!” begins.
INT. CORNER OF THE SOUND STAGE - DAY
The song has developed and the dance begun, but here, off the
set, the blaring playback is echoing and not as loud. Eddie
Mannix enters the stage. He is dimly lit only by spill from
the bar set, house lights turned off for shooting.
Eddie gives cautious looks around as he hoists the attaché
case, now secured around its middle by a shiny black belt. He
gingerly stows the attaché case behind an electrical box
bearing the warning, DANGER! HIGH VOLTAGE.
INT. WATERFRONT BAR
BACK TO THE SET
The song finishes with Burt being ass-bounced and the
bartender bellowing:
BARTENDER
Now cut that out! This ain’t that
kind of place!
The general pandemonium of the dancing sailors is arrested by
a voice through a megaphone:
VOICE
And... cut! Yah, okay. Okay.
We cut behind the director seated on a canvas chair onto the
back of which his name is stitched: “Ärne Seslum.”

66.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Come here, Burt Gurney. We go
again.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
All right, kids, back to one!
Burt Gurney walks up, boyishly cheerful, and is joined by the
Bartender.
BURT
Anything different, Mr. Seslum?
ÄRNE
Yah yah yah, no no no, mostly
pretty good. But this time, don’t
put dishrag on bartender’s head.
You’re the star of the picture,
Burt Gurney. Who cares about the
bartender, you are the star.
The Bartender grumbles, walking away:
BARTENDER
That’s my whole character, the slow
burn.
BURT
(genuine)
Gosh, Mr. Seslum, I don’t mind, if
he wants me to——
ÄRNE
It is decided!
Eddie Mannix walks up.
Lo, Burt.

EDDIE

Brightly, before heading back to the set:
BURT
Hello, Mr. Mannix!
EDDIE
Ärne, I don’t want to stick my nose
in other people’s business, but,
uh, I understand you’ve been, uh,
associating with DeeAnna Moran?
ÄRNE
Yah yah we associated.

67.
EDDIE
Yes, and she’s——
ÄRNE
But no more. No more. Don’t you
worry, Eddie Mannix.
EDDIE
But Ärne, you are aware that she’s,
uh——
ÄRNE
This must not be in movie
magazines, that we associated.
EDDIE
No, of course not——
ÄRNE
My wife cannot read this.
EDDIE
Your——excuse me?
Ärne fishes out a wallet.
ÄRNE
Ilsa Pflug.
Ilsa...?

EDDIE

Ärne shows him a picture of himself and a plump woman with
braids.
ÄRNE
Ilsa Pflug-Seslum. In Malmo.
EDDIE
I was not aware of that.
Ärne flips through, showing more pictures: himself skiing;
the family posed together in cable sweaters.
ÄRNE
Yah, yah, two children.
EDDIE
(sotto)
Third on the way, apparently.
ÄRNE
Do you have physical culture, Eddie
Mannix? Do you ski?

68.
EDDIE
No, I, uh, never took it up. Seems
like a lot of fun.
ÄRNE
Yah, fresh air.
(thumps himself on chest)
Air in——
(he sucks in)
Out——
(he blows out)
Lungs. Breathe.
(takes back the wallet)
I no more associate with DeeAnna
Moran——it is decided!
Uh-huh——

EDDIE

Something on the set, past Eddie’s shoulder, draws Ärne’s
furious look.
ÄRNE
NO, no, no, don’t swing your arms
like hairy ape! This is not fat
stupid people, this is Ärne Seslum
production!
INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
Raucous male laughter hits the cut. The men are emerging from
the hall into the main room, Baird and Herman in the lead,
Baird’s arm draped companionably over Herman’s shoulder.
BAIRD
So I feel someone poking me and I
wake up and it’s Clark and he says,
”Well, her keys weren’t in there so
I guess we’re walkin’!”
Roaring laughter from the Communists.
BAIRD (CONT’D)
This was back before Gable was
Gable.
The men make themselves comfortable in the living room with
its view of the crashing surf. It is now late day; a red sun
hangs beyond the jagged rocks at the mouth of the cove.
Baird is lost in misty reminiscence:

69.
BAIRD (CONT’D)
We used to go to San Berdoo every
weekend, Bob Stack would come
sometimes, the Blue Grotto was
still open——Dave Chasen was a
busboy...
(the dramatic view finally
registers)
Quite a place! Yours?
HERMAN
Oh, gracious no. It belongs to a
member of our study group. He
couldn’t be here this
afternoon——he’ll be sad to have
missed you. He’s a fan.
BAIRD
Uh-huh, that’s swell. So I black
out, wake up here and I’m thinking,
Baird, you have got to stop doing
this!
(laughter)
But you’re saying, actually,
technically I’ve been... kidnapped.
Again, agreeable laughter from the Communists. Herman smiles
as well.
HERMAN
Well, technically, yes.
BAIRD
And there’s gonna be a ransom.
BENEDICT
I’d hardly call it “ransom.”
Herman indicates the speaker.
HERMAN
Benedict there——that’s Benedict de
Bonaventure——wrote “The House of
Ahasuaris.”
A low whistle from Baird. Herman nods.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
Yes. Enormous hit, made the studio
millions of dollars. Did you see
any of those millions of dollars,
Ben?

70.

I did not.

BENEDICT

HERMAN
Dutch over there——Dutch
Zweistrong——wrote “All The Way To
Uruguay.”
DUTCH
(testy)
I wrote all the “All The Way”
pictures.
HERMAN
All successful. You see any of the
profits, Dutch?
Dutch gives a short barking laugh.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
All of us here are writers. The
pictures originated with us,
they’re our ideas, but they’re
owned by the studio. I’m not saying
only writers are being exploited——I
mean, look at yourself, Baird.
BAIRD
Oh, you know——the studio takes care
of me.
ANGRY MAN
What’re you, a child?
HERMAN
(apology for the bad
manners)
I think what Herschel’s trying to
say is, just because the studio
owns the means of production, why
should it be able to take the
money——our money, the value created
by our labor——and dole out what it
pleases? That’s not right. So——no.
No, I wouldn’t call it “ransom.”
Payback.

DUTCH

FOURTH MAN
Partial payback.

71.
HERMAN
Now, until quite recently our study
group had a narrow focus. We
concentrated on getting Communist
content into motion
pictures——always in a sub rosa way,
of course. And we’ve been pretty
darn successful. You remember, in
“Kerner’s Corner”——the Town Hall
scene, where the aldermen overturn
the rotten election and make Gus
the mayor?
BAIRD
(getting it, nodding)
Oh! Yeah. Uh-huh.
HERMAN
I like to think we’ve changed a few
minds. But then——well, Dr. Marcuse
came down from Stanford, joined the
study group. And started teaching
us about direct action. Praxis.
Action.
Faintly gesturing with his pipe:
DR. MARCUSE
We each pursue our own economic
interest——we ourselves are not
above the laws of history. But in
pursuing our interest with vigor,
we accelerate the dialectic, and
hasten the end of history and the
creation of the New Man.
ANGRY MAN
Plus, we make a little dough.
HERMAN
Shutup! We're not even talking
about money; we're talking about
economics.
BAIRD
Uh-huh. Sure. Good. Good stuff.
So——do I get a share of the ransom?
Chuckles all around. Herman gives a weak smile.
HERMAN
Well——no, Mr. Whitlock. You could
hardly share in your own ransom.
That would be unethical.

72.
BAIRD
Well, I don’t know if that’s fair,
fellas! The whole set-up only works
if I play along, right, if I don’t
let on I know who kidnapped me?
HERMAN
Yes. That’s right.
BAIRD
So what if I don’t play along? What
if I named names?
The smiling faces around him harden.
Baird, committed, plows on:
BAIRD (CONT’D)
... Just... told the truth?
The alienation is palpable. Herman alone seems unruffled:
HERMAN
I don’t think you’ll do that, Mr.
Whitlock. What if we told the
truth, about——”On Wings as Eagles?”
Baird instantly sobers.
He looks up at the men around him, their faces set. He looks
at Herman, the one person still smiling.
INT. SID SIEGELSTEIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Eddie Mannix arrives to lean against his door jamb. The legal
bullpen, rows of decks, is at his back.
EDDIE
Sid, we have to work something out
for DeeAnna Moran.
Sid looks up from his paperwork.
SID
She get married again?
EDDIE
No, that’s the problem. Having a
child, not married.
A whistle from Sid.

73.

Tough.

SID

EDDIE
Yeah. No father. Well, of course
there is one, somewhere...
He waves airily. Sid nods understanding.
SID
But who knows...
EDDIE
Exactly. So is there any way
she——I’m just spitballing here——any
way she could adopt her own child?
Sid gazes at Eddie. His look drifts off.
SID
Interesting... As a single...
EDDIE
Mm, she disappears for a while,
reappears——
Uh-huh.

SID

EDDIE
——and she wants to share her
blessings——adopt a child.
SID
Sure, she’s always yearned to be a
mother...
That’s it.

EDDIE

SID
Well, I don’t see why not. Nothing
in California statute that
prohibits adoption by one’s own
parent.
Uh-huh.

EDDIE

SID
This is new ground here.
Technically, she’d have to give up
the baby, in order to adopt it, to
a third... party——

74.
EDDIE
Joe Silverman.
Natalie, with clipboard, approaches from the background.
SID
Joe Silverman, exactly. He’s the
foster father for a few days. She
hands the kid to Joe, he hands it
back... I’ll do some research.
(taps his desktop)
This is exciting.
NATALIE
Mr. Mannix, it’s five-thirty.
EXT. CAPITOL LOT / EDITING ROOM - DAY
It is a very late day. Eddie Mannix strides through the
campus with Natalie trailing.
NATALIE
——and asked all the assistant
directors. One of them said that an
extra in the courtyard-of-SestimusAmydias scene seemed jumpy.
EDDIE
All right, get Walt the name of the
the extra so he can bring him in
and sweat him. Walt should tell him
we won’t press charges if he tells
us where Baird’s been taken.
Check.

NATALIE

EDDIE
If he plays dumb——or if the A.D.’s
wrong and he is dumb——check the
other extras.
NATALIE
Check. Thessaly Thacker called,
said you promised her an interview
with Baird today. Check that, it
was Thora Thacker.
EDDIE
No, it was Thessaly. Tell her he
was at the doctor longer than
expected, she can see him on the
set bright and early tomorrow.

75.
NATALIE
Check. And is that last part true?
EDDIE
Let’s hope so. That reminds me: I
need a list of everyone who worked
on “On Wings as Eagles” who’s still
at the studio.
NATALIE
“On Wings as Eagles”——that’s a
while ago, now. Aside from Baird
and the director it won’t be a long
list.
EDDIE
Uh-huh, get it for me. That it?
NATALIE
One more thing: a Mr. Cuddahy
called, said you know him.
Yeah yeah.

EDDIE

They are mounting a set of steps leading to a long walkway
with many doors spaced at short and regular intervals.
NATALIE
Said it’s urgent he see you one
last time. Suggested same place,
seven this evening.
EDDIE
What?! Why? Never mind.
(checks watch)
Tell him I’ll be there.
INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY
He bangs through a door:
C. C. CALHOUN
EDITING
INSIDE
A stout middle-aged woman is at work at a clattering upright
moviola. A cigarette plumes in one hand. The room is layered
with stale smoke.

76.
EDDIE
Hello, C.C.
The woman spins around in her castored chair and the chair
creaks as she tips her body back so as to aim her face at
Eddie. Her thinkc glasses make her eyes float hugely before
her face.
The eyes blink.
Her voice is emphysemic:
C.C.
Hello, Eddie.
EDDIE
Wanna lace up what you have on
“Merrily We Dance”?
C.C.
Just working on it now. I’ll slap
on a little music.
C.C. brakes the picture, rolls to a trim bin, pulls track
from a pin, flanges it on the side of the moviola and then
lays it under a sound head. She snaps down the head and rolls
the movie forward.
Eddie leans in to look at the picture cube. Glow from the
moviola screen underlights Eddie’s face.
A fanfare. On the screen, a card:
LAURENCE LAURENTZ PRESENTS
Grease-marks on the print form a V that indicates a fade
down.
As waltz music comes up, an inverted V grease-mark indicates
a fade up on a shot of the dancing feet of many people, gowns
swirling, tuxedoed legs debonairly stepping.
Supered on the shot:
MERRILY WE DANCE!
Another fade-down mark.
Lateral track on the feet of a man and a woman, crossing a
city sidewalk. The man's feet hurry out of frame as we hear
him call “Taxi!”

77.
The woman's feet continue on to bring into frame, when she
reaches the curb, the bottom of a cab door being opened for
her by the man.
As she climbs into the cab we match cut into:
The back of the cab. The pretty young woman slides over so
that a caddish looking young man can sit in as well. The cab
starts into motion.
CAD
Back to your place?
ALLEGRA
Oh, what a bore. I rather thought
we might go to Lake Onondega for
the weekend, just the two of us.
CAD
Don't have my valise——I left it in
your foyer.
ALLEGRA
(sly)
You'll get by without a change.
CAD
(wolf)
Suits me. If you don't mind
skipping out on your own party,
Allegra.
Suits me.

ALLEGRA

CAD
(meaningful)
And skipping out on Monty.
ALLEGRA
(smile)
That suits me as well.
The man laughs.
CAD
Poor Monty.
ALLEGRA
What Monty doesn’t know...
CAD
... won’t hurt Monty.

78.
SWELL APARTMENT INTERIOR
Lateral track on a pair of feet: a man walking down a
hallway. As he enters a foyer he comes up short, feet turned
halfway toward a valise that has been left under a table.
After a considering beat he proceeds on, and we pan his feet
to a door which he opens.
A match cut around the other side of the door onto the person
entering, who is now revealed to be——Hobie Doyle. We are now
in the scene we saw being shot.
DIERDRE
Oh Monty! Come join me on the
divaaaaa...
As Dierdre beckons Monty her motion slows, and her slowing
speech becomes basso before lapsing to quiet and the
ratcheting noise of the machine also falls quiet and we are
looking at a frozen frame that slowly discolors at the
center.
The discoloration starts to spread outward as the frame
burns.
Eddie looks quizzically at the stalled picture.
A rasping voice:
Reversh.

C.C.

Eddie looks and reacts with a modest but definite take at:
C.C. bent double in her chair, the side of her face pressed
snugly to the moviola near the gearing for the sound roll.
The side of her face is squashed flat against the machine and
something cinches the folds of fat at her neck. She is being
strangled.
Reversh.

C.C. (CONT’D)

Eddie looks helplessly at the machine.
Reversh.

C.C. (CONT’D)

Eddie casts frantically about, locates the forward/reverse
switch, flips it.
The soundtrack grinds into motion, in reverse. The picture
plays likewise.

79.
As the sound relays feed out her scarf, C.C. has increasing
play such that she may slowly draw her head away from the
machine.
When she is completely free she hits the handbrake, stopping
the film.
C.C. (CONT’D)
Shouldn’t wear scarves.
She sucks greedily at a cigarette. She flips the reverse
switch and the film rolls forward again.
Hobie once again enters, looking very dashing in his tux.
DIERDRE
Oh Monty! Come join me on the
divan.
The discolored frame flashes by and Monty sits into a
brooding close shot on the divan.
DIERDRE (CONT’D)
It seems Allegra's a no-show, which
is simply a bore, but I can partner
you in bridge.
(reacting to him)
Why the pout?
A hold on Hobie as he frames a haunted answer.
Finally:
HOBIE
It’s... complicated.
INT. IMPERIAL GARDENS - DAY
A gong stings the cut to pushing in to Arthur Fung as he
gives a short bow.
ARTHUR FUNG
How pleasant to see you again, Mr.
Manni——
SPLASH! A push through the curtain of beads to see Mr.
Cuddahy, looking up from his booth, a drink with an umbrella
in front of him.
CUDDAHY
Thanks for coming back, Mannix.

80.

Sure.

EDDIE

CUDDAHY
(chuckling)
You’re taking us down to the wire,
aren’t ya?
EDDIE
It’s not a ploy——just a big
decision.
CUDDAHY
Absolutely! No foul. But the board
was concerned when I couldn’t give
‘em a yes this afternoon, and
they’ve authorized me to say this.
You sign on, your term of contract
is ten years.
Eddie gives a low whistle. Cuddahy nods.
Yeah. You get it, right? That means
your stock options are guaranteed
to vest. You’d never have to work
again if you chose to retire after
your term. Think about it: lifetime
employment; you wouldn’t be a
glorified working stiff like you
are now. And you'll be running a
business, not a circus. Drink?
(notices Eddie’s look)
Cigarette?
Cuddahy proffers the pack which Eddie has been eyeing. Eddie
hesitates, shakes his head.
EDDIE
No, no I——I have to run, I, I
should talk this over with my
wife——
CUDDAHY
Course you should. Talk it over,
think about your family, let us
know in the morning. Oh!
(grinning, produces two
packages)
Now, if you think this is a bribe,
you’re absolutely right. Two kids,
right, boy and a girl? They love
this stuff. Used to be trains.

81.
EXT. A SPANISH-STYLE HOME - EVENING
Glowing in the early evening.
Reverse on its drive. Hobie Doyle leans against a parked limo
with his arms folded, waiting, gazing at the mansion. A long,
still beat, and then he abruptly sflffs a bunch of sunflower
shells out of his mouth.
He gazes idly around.
He has a thought.
He opens the back door of the limo and takes out a length of
rope.
He starts twirling, creating a nice big loop. He expertly
tips his wrist to make the loop spin level with the ground at
a height of half a foot. He hops in and out of the loop.
VOICE
Hello Hobie.
Startled, he muffs a hop-out and the rope dies against his
shins.
HOBIE
Oh hello Carlotta.
Am I late?

CARLOTTA

He coils the rope.
HOBIE
Aw no it ain’t nothin’. Thanks an
awful bunch for goin’ to this
picture with me, I don’t know if
you like livestock but I think it’s
got moments I really do. You look
var purty.
CARLOTTA
Well, thank you, Hobie. I’m sure
I’ll like the picture——I like all
of your pictures.
HOBIE
Well I like yours too, they are
just the craziest things. Is it
hard to dance with all them bananas
on your head?

82.
She plants her purse on her head as she demonstrates a rhumba
move:
CARLOTTA
Oh no, anyone can do it, is all
inna hips anna-lips anna-eyes annathighs!
She finishes with a kick and a head-tip that launches the
purse backwards off her head to be grabbed by one hand behind
her back.
INT. MANNIX’S KIDS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
We hear a door opening and hallway light fans onto an
adorable little girl asleep in bed.
Eddie looks down at her, smiles, stoops to adjust the doll
she holds against her face. He rises to gaze down for another
beat, then moves.
The opposite bed: an adorable little boy. Eddie eases the
askew coonskin cap off of the boy, stands looking down.
Top of the boy’s wardrobe. Baseball pennants are on the wall
behind it. Eddie’s hands enter to place a soaring airplane on
a peg on a pedestal.
Top of the girl’s wardrobe. Dolls are seated on it leaning
against the wall. Eddie’s hands enter to place a folded
maroon uniform, and, on top of the uniform, a maroon cap with
“Stewardess” stiched in gold.
INT. MANNIX’S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Eddie is at a plateful of dinner. His wife bustles as he
eats.
MRS. MANNIX
Little Eddie wanted me to tell you
about his baseball game. They won.
EDDIE
That’s terrific. Gosh, I never
called the coach! Eddie played at
shortstop?
MRS. MANNIX
Mm, and he did so well he wants to
stay there now.

83.
EDDIE
Great, it took care of itself.
MRS. MANNIX
And Darlene did very well on her
Spanish test.
EDDIE
That’s good, she was worried about
that. Thanks for heating up the
roast.
MRS. MANNIX
Warm glass of milk?
EDDIE
No, thanks hon——coffee. Gotta run
back to the studio, a few things to
take care of.
MRS. MANNIX
Gee, another late night.
Eddie is ruminative:
EDDIE
Mm. You know... Lockheed improved
their offer. Darned good money. And
the hours wouldn’t be crazy like
this, either.
MRS. MANNIX
It’s nice to be wanted.
EDDIE
Yeah, sure, but——what do you think?
They wanna know tomorrow.
MRS. MANNIX
I like the shorter hours. But what
do you think, honey? You know best.
Nodding, chewing, thinking:
Uh-huh...

EDDIE

MRS. MANNIX
How’s it going with the smoking,
dear?
Eddie is startled out of his ruminations:

84.
EDDIE
Oh, you know...
INT. EDDIE’S PACKARD - NIGHT
EDDIE IN HIS PACKARD
He drives, squinting against oncoming headlights.
The plummy-voiced narrator:
VOICE-OVER
The denizens of the great city make
ready for nightlife——or for sleep.
But Eddie Mannix will have
neither...
EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
Familiar shot from high on the bluff down on the octahedral
house, now glowing with internal light. The ocean is no more
than glittering highlights caught from the moon.
VOICE-OVER
Even in westerly Malibu the sun has
moved on, leaving the vast and
tireless sea to heave itself
blindly upon the shore.
INSIDE
We are in the living room which, it being night, offers no
more view. The writers sit playing at cards, smoking, seeking
to make time pass.
A man circles the table dropping a pair of gloves next to
each card player——fingerless gloves with leather grips, as
for golfing. The card players little notice the deposit of
gloves at their places.
VOICE-OVER
Baird Whitlock has become an
acolyte of the Communists, a
convert to their cause, his belief
compelled but not grudging——no more
than was Saul’s on the dusty road
of long ago. He now seeks to learn
more from the leader from the
north...

85.
Baird is indeed sitting with Professor Marcuse, who is just
finishing talking as their conversation mixes up, with Baird
nodding vigorous concurrence.
VOICE-OVER (CONT’D)
... and becomes ever more committed
to the quest to hasten an end to
history and bring on——the New Man!
BAIRD
Herb——Herb!——That’s exactly what I
was talking about, that’s what
happened when I went to Reno with
Danny Kaye and he asked me to shave
his back! Exact same thing!
Because I'm thinking——who benefits?
Also, I gotta tell ya, everyone
thinks Danny is a jerk but he’s not
really a jerk, it’s just the theory
generating its own anti-theory...
Professor Marcuse’s brow furrows as he tries to follow
Baird’s point.
... So there we are, me and Danny,
and I’m wondering what the hell I’m
doing with this razor and he says
it’s for a part in a Norman Taurog
picture but Judy Canova is there
and she knows Norman and she says
Danny’s not doing a Norman Taurog
picture——he just wants you to shave
his back! And that’s who benefits!
INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE - NIGHT
A LOBBY CARD
It is for “Lazy Ol’ Moon,” starring Hobie Doyle. When it is
wiped by a foreground cross we cut wider:
The near-empty lobby of a grand theater. A latecoming
gentleman and his wife are opening the auditorium door to
enter, the movie’s soundtrack fanning up as they do so.
VOICE-OVER
In livelier precincts, the swells
of Dreamland gather to inspect the
complicated weave of another piece
of gossamer...

86.
INSIDE
Hobie and Carlotta are watching the movie.
VOICE-OVER
... Another movie, another portion
of balm for the ache of a toiling
mankind.
Hobie leans in to Carlotta.
HOBIE
Don’t know ’bout this part, they
only gimme one shot at the song.
ONSCREEN
EXT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
It is evening. A pretty young woman converses through a
cookhouse window with a grizzled old man in the yard. The
man——Curly——wears the union suit and the bent-back hatbrim of
a Western sidekick.
Someone offscreen is lazily chording a guitar.
CURLY
It wasn't my fault you saw me take
the pie off the sill Miz McGraw.
WOMAN
Not your fault! Whose fault was it,
Curly?
CURLY
Why, that crazy full moon! Two
weeks ago you'd a never seen me
take it!
Laughter from the audience as Curly stomps over to the man
playing guitar: Hobie, relaxing on a tipped-back chair on the
bunkhouse porch.
CURLY (CONT’D)
Durn that moon! What good is she
anyhow! Wish there never was no
moon! Wish there warn't no bossy
old women!
HOBIE
Don’t blame that moon, Curly. She
can’t do nothin’ but shine!

87.
The guitar intro has ended and Hobie launches into the first
verse of “Lazy Ol' Moon.” He looks up at the moon,
occasionally looks back to the pretty woman in the window who
listens, smiling.
As the verse ends we cut to Curly elsewhere in the yard,
looking angrily down at something off:
CURLY
Durn you! You turned Curly Strimlin
over to the authorities for the
last time!
We cut over his shoulder: he is addressing a reflection of
the moon in a watering trough. He now dives in with hands
outstretched as if to throttle the reflection.
Hobie sings on. Curly sits up in the trough sputtering and
looks around, stymied and irate.
CURLY (CONT’D)
Durn! Where'd she go?!
Roaring laughter from the audience.
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OFFICE BUILDINGS - NIGHT
Eddie Mannix pulls up in his Packard. It is late night; the
street is deserted except for one swank parked car, a creamcolored luxury sedan, that stands out on this less-than-swank
street. The car’s uniformed driver leans against the hood
smoking.
INT. INSIDE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
A wooden stairway. On the risers are painted the names of the
building’s business tenants. Eddie Mannix trudges up the
stairs in fedora and trenchcoat with collar turned up.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT
It is lined by doors with transom windows. Lettering on the
pebbled glass of each office door identifies its occupant.
One office only shows light from inside:
JOSEPH SILVERMAN
SURETIES/BONDS/ESCROW

88.
INT. JOE SILVERMAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Eddie taps at the door.
It is opened by Sid Sieglestein, the studio lawyer. An inneroffice door, standing open, shows Joe Silverman sitting at
his desk; mid-thirties and, like his office, low-rent but
neat and utterly without character.
DeeAnna Moran sits across from him in a cream-colored dress
that matches her car outside, and a black hat and veil. She
has a cigarette in one hand and with the other signs a
document in multiple places as Joe, leaning across the desk,
turns pages and points.
SID
We just got started——I’ve been
taking DeeAnna through this.
They are joining the two in the inner office, Sid now
addressing DeeAnna.
... So Joseph has done——well, just
a whole lot of good work for us in
the past. Whenever we’ve needed a
witness or a third party for, I
don’t know——a petition of grievance
or alienation of affection.
DeeAnna sneaks looks at Joe as she signs pages.
DEEANNA
And he’s reliable?
The man shows no resentment of the question and indeed no
affect at all:
JOE
I’m bonded, miss.
SID
Joe is the most reliable human
being on the planet, in our
experience. When Chubby Cregar was
intoxicated and hit a pedestrian on
Gower, we had his vehicle title
transferred to Joe’s name and Joe
did six months in the LA County
lock-up.
DEEANNA
But you’re off the sauce now?

89.
JOE
I never touch it, miss. It was a
legal fiction.
EDDIE
That’s exactly right. When the
studio needs somebody who meets the
legal standard of, uh——how did you
put it, Sid?
SID
Personhood.
EDDIE
Yeah. Joe steps in and acts as the,
uh... person.
DEEANNA
So you’re a professional——person?
JOE
That’s right, miss. And initial
here, and here.
SID
Joe will be the foster parent until
such time as you adopt the child,
which you can do as soon as Joe
takes possession of it.
DEEANNA
And he’s reliable?
JOE
I’m bonded, miss.
SID
The release papers you’re signing
are not public record. All these
documents remain sealed until the
year two thousand and fifteen.
Joe takes the document and slides its last page into an
embosser and squeezes.
DEEANNA
No one the wiser?
SID
No one the wiser. No fans, no court
officials——not even a notary
public.

90.
EDDIE
Joe himself is the notary.
DeeAnna examines Joe who is tensed, squeezing with both
hands.
DEEANNA
You must have strong forearms. Is
it hard, squeezing like that?
JOE
It’s part of the job.
EXT. STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
Scotty the guard leans out, tipping his cap, as the Packard
pulls up.
SCOTTY
Late night, Mr. Mannix?
EDDIE
Late night for both of us. Will you
call Projection Seven and have’m
lace up yesterday’s dailies on
“Hail, Cæsar!”
SCOTTY
Sure thing. Yesterday’s.
EDDIE
Yeah, thanks Scotty.
INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT
Eddie Mannix sits slumped, hand cupped to forehead, light
flickering onto him from the screen. Natalie sits on his far
side with her clipboard, waiting for his attention.
EXT. WELL OF JEHOSAPHAT SET - DAY
Onscreen: we pull Baird Whitlock, in his Roman tribune's
wardrobe, as he marches angrily up a line of parched and
dusty slaves clamoring for water. Baird curses and exclaims
“Romans before slaves!” as he bats aside those waiting.
As he reaches the front of the line our pull back has brought
into frame the man giving out water with a dipper. This man,
whom we see only from behind, wears a simple robe and has
perfectly arranged shoulder-length blond hair, slightly wavy.

91.
Baird/Autolochus——once more exclaiming “Roman's before
slaves!”——intercepts the dipper which the blond man is
handing to a slave. Autolochus is about to drink himself
when he takes in the countenance of the blond water-giver.
Something in the man's face and manner strikes Autolochus
mightily. He takes a staggering step backward, in awe.
Close on Baird, his face displaying progressive waves of awe,
puzzlement, hope, and ineffable wonder.
A flash frame and a slate for “Hail, Cæsar, Twenty-Seven
Baker Two.”
Baird steps back into close shot with the dipper again, now
displaying waves of puzzlement, ineffable wonder, some awe,
then back to ineffable wonder.
We hear an offscreen “Cut!” but before the flash frame Baird
relaxes, his eyeline shifting as he calls out:
BAIRD
Wuddya think a that one, was that,
uh, enough, awe, or——
VOICE
Yeah, good, maybe a little more
wonderment.
BAIRD
More, you mean more——
“Hail Cæsar, Twenty-Seven Baker Three.”
Baird steps back into frame in awe.
BAIRD (CONT’D)
Hold it, sorry, wait a minute,
lemme do it again.
He steps forward then immediately steps back into frame in
awe. A squinting bit of wonder.
Cut!

VOICE

BAIRD
Was that, uh, I don’t know. That
one didn’t really have a center.
VOICE
Yeah, no, it was——
“Hail Cæsar, Twenty-Seven Baker Four.”

92.
Baird steps back into frame his face oddly blank.
Hang on.

BAIRD

His eyes leave the eyeline. He looks down, arranges his
features in an expression of unutterable awe, and then jerks
his look back up to the eyeline, expression locked in place.
A long hold, expression steady: unutterable awe.
Finally, hissing out of his locked jaw as he maintains the
look:
BAIRD (CONT’D)
Howziss. Wuddya hink.
VOICE
Yeah, okay, cut.
Eddie, watching. His eyes stay on the screen throughout:
EDDIE
Go ahead, I’m listening.
From screen: “Hail Cæsar, Twenty-Seven Baker Five.”
NATALIE
Walt talked to the extra, right
guy, no info——doesn’t know where
they took Baird, but described the
truck they put him in.
BAIRD
(from screen)
Was that, uh, was that——should I
get to the wonderment faster?
NATALIE
Walt found the truck and found the
guy who borrowed it from the guy
who owns it and is talking to him.
From screen: “Hail Cæsar, Twenty-Seven Baker Six.”
Eddie nods, still looking at the screen.
EDDIE
Walt’s a problem-solver, he’s a
good man. What else?

93.
BAIRD
(from screen)
Todd, you can——you just look like
an imbecile mushed up against the
camera, can you——Sam, Todd can step
out, I’ll just take an eyeline at
the corner of the matte box. I'll
hand the dipper back to, uh, to,
uh, camera guy.
From screen: “Hail Cæsar, Twenty-Seven Baker Seven.”
NATALIE
PR just called in their report on
Hobie Doyle premier: warm
reception.
BAIRD
(from screen)
Was that——I’m sorry, did you see
that, I felt like I had some
spittle. Maybe Todd should step
back in.
EDDIE
Good. Okay.
(starts to rise, eyes
still on the screen)
Not bad, have ‘em use six. Is this
six?
INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT
An orchestra plays “Every Now and Then.”
Carlotta laughs, across a table from:
Hobie, hunched forward, very intent on what he is doing, his
body jiggling.
Wider: he has a strand of spaghetti and is doing rope tricks
with it.
HOBIE
Watchis now... Gittin’ away...
He ropes a salt cellar.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
Oh looka there now!
His other hand, on the tablecloth, is starting to walk away
on two fingers, affecting nonchalance.

94.
Thinking itself safely out of range, the walking hand starts
to walk faster.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
... Oh, she’s a gittin’ away too!
He ropes the walking fingers, tripping his hand.
Carlotta, unable to talk from laughter, points at Hobie.
Hobie ropes the pointing finger, draws her hand toward him.
She slaps at his hand with her free hand. He drops the
spaghetti to slap her hand in return then plucks the whipping
spaghetti-end out of the air in rhythm.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
This’s why I never order it with
meat sauce.
CARLOTTA
How’d you get into pictures, Hobie?
HOBIE
Got roped into it! Aw, I’m just
kiddin ya, I wrangled fer a while
and then they saw I could say a
line’r two’n I was Bad Clem or
Deppity Number Two or the guy’s
buddy fer a coupla years’n then
some’n heard me sing’n they made me
the guy.
CARLOTTA
You’re awfully cute.
HOBIE
Aw heck, you ain’t seen the half of
it, I’ll show ya cute, just second
here——little souvenir from when I
was rodeoin’...
He has lowered his head to his hand and he fiddles briefly at
his mouth. He raises his head again, beaming at Carlotta.
He has no teeth. His gums, upper and lower, are hideously
bare.
Carlotta is aghast——and then amused, more than ever. Hobie
chuckles as she laughs:

95.
HOBIE (CONT’D)
Tell ya what, I wuzh shteerbrushtin an I went down and the
shteer went up’n m’teeth headed off
fer easht Texash——Aww here, it’s
comin’ round again!
He hastily tucks his teeth back in and croons along with the
orchestra which is just now arriving at the chorus:
Every now and then...
Carlotta comes in on top:
CARLOTTA
Every now and then...
The two sing together but Hobie suddenly freezes, seeing
something.
Long-lens point of view: a bulging attaché case bound around
the middle by a shiny black belt. It rests beside a semicircular booth, half the throw of the restaurant away.
Whoever has the case is hidden by his high-backed booth. His
back is to us: the side of one leg juts out as does one
elbow, active as he eats.
VOICE
Well now, this is interesting.
Hobie’s look turns up: Thessaly Thacker stands at his booth.
THESSALY THACKER
I didn’t know you two were friends.
Hobie is distracted, his look shifting between her and the
hidden man.
HOBIE
Aw heck yeah, we——we just caught my
picture, “Lazy Ol' Moon,” ‘n I
guess we’re——
CARLOTTA
Yes, we’re friends, we’re——
HOBIE
Well we’re fixin’ t’be friendly,
tell you that.

96.
THESSALY THACKER
That’s good: “Fixin’ To Be
Friendly” can be my column
headline.
Finger-quotes and an exaggerated impression of Hobie’s accent
set off the reference. Hobie, unoffended, nods.
HOBIE
Well I guess at’d be okay.
THESSALY THACKER
Have a good evening.
As she moves off Hobie and Carlotta exchange a look: how did
we do? But Hobie’s look keeps returning to the mystery diner.
HOBIE
I mentioned the name of m’picture,
I think we’re s’posed to do that.
His long-lens point of view: Thessaly Thacker has stopped to
talk to the hidden man with the attaché case. Brief
conversation. Thessaly tips her head back laughing at some
pleasantry. Her cackle carries across the room.
VOICE
Well now, this is interesting.
Hobie’s look turns up: it is——impossibly——Thessaly Thacker
again. Or, no it isn’t, it’s Thora.
THORA THACKER
I thought I was getting an
exclusive on this.
HOBIE
What’s that now, ma’am?
She is looking off at her cackling sister.
THORA THACKER
I’d like to know what the hell is
going on here.
HOBIE
We, uhh... like I said, we just saw
“Lazy Ol' Moon”——
CARLOTTA
And Hobie and I are fixin t’be
friendly!

97.
Thora’s baleful look swings onto her. It holds for a long
moment. Then a squint:
What?

THORA THACKER

HOBIE
We’re just, uh...
His eyes widen: the mystery man is getting up. The man stands
briefly outside the booth but is turned mostly away from us,
patting at his mouth with a napkin. He angles more toward us.
It is Burt Gurney.
He finishes patting his mouth, tosses the napkin onto the
table. His face, so boyish when performing, is now a hard
mask.
He stoops to pick up the attaché case. A brief look around
the restaurant, and he heads off.
Hobie hastily shuffles himself out of his booth:
HOBIE (CONT’D)
Ah gotta skedaddle. So sorry!
(to Carlotta)
Have to catch one a yer pictures
next time——lookin’ ford to it!
EXT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT
Hobie exits the club just in time to see the passing-by
vehicle of Burt Gurney.
Hobie hurries to his car and driver waiting curbside.
HOBIE
Toss me them keys, pard——I'm takin'
the car!
INT. EDDIE’S OFFICE
Wide on Eddie behind his desk, half-in, half-out of a pool of
desktop lamplight. He sits hunched, forearms on knees.
An insert: on the desk is a letter, its copy too small to
read. But we see its letterhead: Lockheed.
Back to Eddie, but our angle now swung around so that the
desk does not hide his lower body.

98.
The hands draped across his knees hold a rosary.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD / INT. HOBIE’S CAR - NIGHT
BLEARY MONTAGE
Lots of neon: “The Garden of Allah,” restaurants, clubs,
chase lights around movie-theater marquees. Dissolving in and
out under the Hollywood Boulevard imagery is the same set-up
of Hobie driving, squinting, eyes fixed on tail lights in
front of him.
Also dissolving in and out:
EXT. H.C. SETS - NIGHT
EDDIE MANNIX WALKING
Not his purposeful daytime stride but a contemplative stroll,
his hands clasped Churchillianly behind his back. He passes
through the half-struck columns of the temple of the moneylenders; through the courtyard of Sestimus Amydias, its
fountain now giving only spare, echoing drips; and finally
through a set we have not yet seen: the road to Calvary, its
long line of crucifixes looming empty.
The montage which connects the two men ends with a dissolve
full up on Hobie, still driving, but no more city lights
reflected in his windshield. We are out, remote.
EXT. PCH - NIGHT
His point-of-view: tail lights of the car well ahead——the
only car in sight. Its headlights briefly show us the “Rudy’s
Fish Shack” sign on the right. The car turns left.
Hobie slows as he approaches the turn.
EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
HIGH FROM BLUFF
The octahedral house glows below. Burt’s car is parked.
Hobie’s car eases up.
INSIDE - NIGHT
For the first time the house has no interior noise, no
yapping dog. We hear only the muffled pounding of surf.

99.
The front door clicks, and creaks open.
Hobie enters cautiously, looking around at the quiet as he
walks toward the lens to stop in close shot, gaping now,
surprised at what he sees.
Reverse on the living room. Baird Whitlock is alone, a small
figure in the big room, still in Roman wardrobe, a copy of
Soviet Life open on his lap, martini glass in hand. He gapes
at Hobie in mirroring surprise.
Finally:
BAIRD
Hobie Doyle? You’re a Communist
too?
Hobie looks around, looks back at Baird.
A beat.
HOBIE
So it’s Commies.
BAIRD
Y’ever been in this place? Pretty
nice, huh? Just found out it’s Burt
Gurney’s!
Hobie is not really interested. He looks around a bit more,
trying to make sense of it all.
HOBIE
You here alone?
BAIRD
Everyone else went down to the
beach.
HOBIE
Well, all right pard: let’s us head
on back to town. You got Mr. Mannix
worried sick.
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT
The Communist writers man both sides of a longboat, gloves
on, pulling hard at the oars.
Burt Gurney stands in the prow gazing forward, rather like
George Washington crossing the Delaware but with a yapping
dog in the crook of one arm.

100.
Now his look turns to one side.
His point-of-view: his beach house is coming into view from
behind one of a pair of jagged rocks between us and shore.
Easy...

BURT

The writers row more slowly as the house centers up between
the rocks.
Here!

BURT (CONT’D)

The writers back-paddle to stop the boat. It settles so as to
show the house perfectly centered between the two snagglerocks.
Satisfied with the boat’s position, Burt Gurney looks about:
the vast and empty sea.
He looks at his watch: midnight.
A writer occasionally dips an oar for a short front- or backstroke, keeping the boat in position. The boat dips and bobs,
water slapping on wood. An occasional yap from the dog.
Long beat.
A huge roar. Seething water. Ocean surface just by the
longboat roils mightily——and is breached.
A huge black column rises, rises, rises from the sea.
The writers give voice to an awed “Oh...”
The column stops rising.
The roaring of great engines, and the angry hiss of water
streaming from the column, subsides to... near-silence. Just
the gentle chug of idling engines and the faint bleep. bleep.
bleep. of sonar.
Waves slosh feebly against the imposing black column: the
conning tower of a submarine.
The metallic screek-screek-screek of a hatch being opened.
The sound moves the dog to more yapping.
Burt Gurney hands the dog to one of the forward writers.
BURT (CONT’D)
Take care of him.

101.
He leaps from the longboat to the sub, grabbing brackets set
in a vertical line up its side: a ladder. Before he can
climb, though, writers’ voices exclaim “Tell him!” “Give it
to him!” “Give the speech!”
Comrade!

HERMAN’S VOICE

Burt turns, twisting from the ladder to look back a the
longboat.
Herman rises in front. A ripple of motion goes through the
writers behind him: something is being passed forward.
HERMAN
Comrade: we salute you! You are
going to Moscow to become Soviet
Man and help forge the future. We
stay behind, continuing to serve in
our disguise as capitalist
handmaidens.
Looks around, uncertain, and gets encouraging nods from the
other writers.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
But the money should go to the
cause, not to the servants of the
cause.
A chorus of ‘hear, hear’s from the writers as he gropes for a
finish.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
We——well, we...
The passed-forward object arrives at the man immediately
behind Herman who now gives Herman a nudge. He turns to take
the object, and turns back holding it out toward Burt.
It is the attaché case cinched by black belt.
HERMAN (CONT’D)
Our modest contribution to the
Comintern.
He tosses it, and Burt, with one hand anchoring him to the
ladder, one-handedly catches. He looks at the case, nodding
deep appreciation for what it represents.
He looks up.
BURT
They will be pleased.

102.
The dog, whining and writhing in discontent in the arms of
the writer in charge of him, finally breaks free and leaps
yapping toward his master.
Burt reflexively drops the case to grab the arriving dog.
The case hits the water and dipsy-doodles down, down, down
into murkiness.
The writers give a unison dismayed “Oh...”
Burt Gurney, angled out from the ladder, gazes down at the
spot where the case is disappearing. A long looking beat.
Finally, a small arch of his eyebrow——his only comment on
life’s unpredictability. He swings his body back in against
the sub and climbs one-handed, holding the dog.
A man wearing a sable cap waits at the top. When Burt arrives
the waiting man hands him a sable cap. Burt puts it on and
gazes down at the longboat.
BURT (CONT’D)
Professor! Will you join me?
Marcuse, near the back of the boat, gestures faintly with his
pipe.
MARCUSE
No. I will work from within.
Burt nods concession. The man behind Burt stoops to open the
hatch and both men climb in.
On the writers, watching.
The roar of engines, the seething hiss of water. The sub
descends.
The writers fight their oars to keep the longboat steady in
the bucking sea.
The sub disappears. The sloshes diminish. The black sea rolls
on in peace restored.
After a quiet beat:
WRITER
Well, it’s late. And I have
revisions.

103.
INT. HOBIE’S CAR - NIGHT
HOBIE AND BAIRD
In Hobie’s car they make the right turn from the beach access
road to head south on the coast highway. Hobie hums “Lazy Ol’
Moon” as he drives; Baird gazes placidly out.
Baird is struck by a thought. He looks at his watch, winces.
BAIRD
Late. I am in the doghouse.
Hobie glances at him as Baird thinks.
BAIRD (CONT’D)
Know what, better forget my place.
Drop me at the Beverly Hills
Hotel——that okay?
Sure.

HOBIE

Both men look, attention drawn by sirens: an oncoming line of
police vehicles, their rooflights spinning.
The cars whoosh past.
Baird turns to track them and Hobie looks in his rear-view.
The vehicles skid into a left turn at the “Fish Shack” sign.
Baird faces forward again.
A beat.
Huh!

BAIRD

FADE OUT
FADE IN SOUND: Morning birds, intermittent car-bys.
EXT. STUDIO GATE - MORNING
FADE IN PICTURE: Studio gate.
We are looking across the street at the main gate. There is
little traffic at this early hour. A cab pulls up and stops
curbside. Its passenger gets out.

104.
The cab pulls away and we see the discharged passenger: Baird
Whitlock. Still in breastplate and leather skirt, he saunters
toward the walk-through by the guard shack, whistling.
EXT. ROAD TO CAVALRY - DAY
We track laterally with an Assistant Director who, intent on
a clipboard, slowly walks past a foreground crucifix, the
occupant of which, facing away from us, is in frame only to
the extent of his two crossed feet. The A.D., still studying
his clipboard, slows to a halt just as we bring another
crucifix into the foreground. Its occupant too we see only
from the ankles down.
The A.D. now looks up from the list on his clipboard to the
unseen man on the foreground crucifix.
A.D.
Who’re you?
Todd.

VOICE

The A.D. looks down his list. He shakes his head, still
unclear; he looks back up.
A.D.
Do you get a hot breakfast or a box
breakfast?
VOICE
I don’t know.
The A.D. rolls his eyes.
A.D.
Are you a principal or an extra?
Beat. Then:
VOICE
I think I’m a principal.
INT. EDDIE’S OFFICE - DAY
Baird, in wardrobe, is in the chair in front of Eddie’s desk
with his legs crossed, hands clasped behind his head, the
picture of cheerfulness.

105.
BAIRD
So I’m thinkin’, “What the hell!
I’ve woken up in strange houses
before but never without a broad
next to me!”
Eddie glares.
EDDIE
(tight)
Uh-huh.
Baird, oblivious, thinks he has an audience.
BAIRD
These guys were pretty interesting,
though. They’ve actually figured
out the laws that dictate,
well——everything, history,
sociology, politics, morality.
Everything. It's all in a book
called “Kapital.”
EDDIE
That right.
BAIRD
Uh-huh. With a K. And you’re not
gonna believe this, but it even
explains the stuff we do here at
the studio. Because the studio is
actually nothing more than an
instrument of capitalism!
Uh-huh.

EDDIE

BAIRD
So it blindly follows these laws
just like any other institution,
the laws that these guys’ve figured
out. The studio makes pictures to
serve the system, that’s its
function, that’s really what we’re
all up to, here.
Is it.

EDDIE

Eddie rises from behind his desk and advances on Baird, who
prattles on.

106.
BAIRD
Yeah, we’re just confirming what
they call the “status quo.” I mean,
we might tell ourselves we’re
“creating” something of artistic
value, that there’s some kinda
spiritual dimension to the picture
business, but what it is, is this
fat cat Nick Schenk out in New York
running a factory that makes these
lollypops to pacify the——WHOOF!
Eddie has grabbed Baird by the breastplate and hauled him to
his feet. He now slaps him, forehand and backhand: Slap!
Slap!
What th——

BAIRD (CONT’D)

Eddie pulls him chest-to-chest and holds him there so that he
may stare straight into his eyes as the words pour out:
EDDIE
Now you listen to me, buster: Nick
Schenk and this studio have been
good to you and to everyone else
who works here. If I ever hear you
badmouthing Mr. Schenk again it’ll
be the last thing you say before I
have you tossed into jail for
colluding in your own abduction.
BAIRD
But Eddie, I didn’t——
Slap! Slap!
EDDIE
Shaddup. You’re gonna go out there
and you’re gonna finish “HAIL,
CÆSAR!” You’re gonna give that
speech at the feet of the penitent
thief and you’re gonna believe
every word you say.
Slap! Slap!
EDDIE (CONT’D)
You’re gonna do it because you’re
an actor and that’s what you do.
Just like the director does what he
does, and the writer and the script
girl and the guy who claps the
slate.
(MORE)

107.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
You’re gonna do it because the
picture has worth and you have
worth if you serve the picture and
you’re never gonna forget that
again.
BAIRD
(blubbering)
Okay Eddie, I won’t forget it.
The manhandling and Eddie’s harsh tone have brought Baird to
tears. Eddie releases his fistful of Romanwear with a shove
that sends Baird staggering backward.
EDDIE
You’re damn right you won’t. Not as
long as I run this dump.
Baird nods, whimpering, as he retreats to the door.
BAIRD
Okay, Eddie.
Eddie reseats himself behind his desk. Baird is reaching for
the doorknob but Eddie stops him with a sharp:
Baird!

EDDIE

Baird turns, sniveling, his hand on the knob.
Eddie smiles, points at him, and gives a tight nod:
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Go out there and be a star!
It heartens Baird. He wipes his eyes with some tunic-sleeve
and even manages a tremulous smile back at Eddie and a return
nod.
EXT. CAPITOL LOT - DAY
EDDIE WALKING
He walks purposefully across the lot. Natalie is deep behind
trotting to catch up, arms full of a flower arrangement.
NATALIE
Mr. Mannix!
He turns, waits.

108.
NATALIE (CONT’D)
Since you’re going to your car,
thought you might want to take
this.
EDDIE
What is it?
NATALIE
From DeeAnna Moran. Thank you, and
she doesn’t need to adopt her baby
after all.
Huh?

EDDIE

NATALIE
She asked Joe Silverman out for
dinner last night, I guess it went
well, they drove to Palm Springs
and were married at three this
morning.
Huh.

EDDIE

NATALIE
Will you be gone long? Today’s list
to go through.
EDDIE
Less than an hour, personal errand.
(down at the flowers he
holds)
Nice arrangement.
NATALIE
She charged it to the studio.
Right.

EDDIE

He turns from her to proceed but immediately stops with a
surprised “Gah!”
THORA THACKER
Just coming to see you.
EDDIE
Good morning. Sorry about last
night, Thora——didn’t know your
sister would show up.

109.
THORA THACKER
Well, that’s as may be, but I
certainly learned my lesson.
Whatever you say today, Eddie
Mannix, my column tomorrow is
about——”On Wings as Eagles.”
EDDIE
Thora, I wouldn’t do that if I were
you.
Thora smiles thinly.
THORA THACKER
I’m sure you wouldn’t.
EDDIE
No no, you don’t understand.
(looks around)
Let’s sit down.
EXT. SEATING AREA - DAY
Thora and Eddie seat themselves at a curved stone bench
beneath a stone table upon which Eddie puts the flowers.
Behind them is a building that says WARDROBE. A Roman
centurion sits against its exterior wall lacing up his
sandals’ calf straps. Others emerge from the building one at
a time, each cinching up the chin strap on his bristle-topped
helmet or giving the bottom of his breastplate a tug or in
some other way making ready.
EDDIE
I’m telling you not to run the
column, Thora, for your own good.
A hoot from Thora.
THORA THACKER
I can judge my own interest. This
will be the story of the year——and
it so happens the Hearst Syndicate
is looking to pick up a Hollywood
column. Hearst is four million
readers. And if I get
them——Thessaly doesn’t.
EDDIE
And you think this’ll cinch it for
you.

110.
THORA THACKER
You know it will! Baird Whitlock,
your biggest star, got his first
major part——in “On Wings as
Eagles”——by engaging in sodomy with
the picture’s director, Laurence
Laurentz.
She wears a smug smile, awaiting protestation.
Eddie only nods, equably.
EDDIE
We’ve all heard the story. But
here’s something you haven’t heard:
your source is a Communist. If you
print it, it’ll be dismissed as a
Commie smear tactic——and you’ll be
dismissed as a Commie stooge.
Her smile starts to fade.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Burt Gurney has left the country
and the cell he was part of has
been smashed by the police. You
might’ve thought he was credible
because he’s Mr. Laurentz’s
current... protegé, but——you don’t
want to be seen as Burt Gurney’s
mouthpiece after this.
Thora’s look curdles.
A beat.
THORA THACKER
How did you know Burt was my
source?
EDDIE
Talked to Laurence late last night,
put two and two together.
(rises, indicating
flowers)
Well, no need to send this since I
ran into you. It’s by way of
apology for Thessaly horning in
last night. I do value our
friendship, Thora——
(looks at watch)
——but I'm late for something
important.

111.
INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY
Light wipes onto Eddie, rosary in hand.
EDDIE
Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned.
VOICE
How long since your last
confession, my son?
EDDIE
It’s been, uh...
(looks at watch)
What, twenty-seven hours?
VOICE
It’s too often, my son. You’re
really not that bad.
Eddie grimly shakes his head.
EDDIE
I don’t know, Father. I snuck
another cigarette. Or two. I didn’t
make it home in time for dinner.
And I, uh... I struck a movie star
in anger.
A sigh from the unseen priest.
VOICE
All right. Five Hail Marys.
EDDIE
Okay. Okay. Father...
Eddie is struggling.
VOICE
Yes my son?
EDDIE
May I ask you something, Father?
FATHER
Of course, my son.
EDDIE
If there’s something that’s easy...
is that wrong?

112.

Easy?

VOICE

EDDIE
Easy to do, easy to——an easy
job——not a bad job, it’s not bad.
But then there’s another job,
that’s... that’s not so easy. In
fact it’s hard. It’s so hard,
Father, sometimes I don’t know if I
can keep doing it. But it seems
right. I don’t know how to explain.
Silence.
Then:
VOICE
God wants us to do what’s right.
EDDIE
Yeah...
(thinking, nodding)
Yeah, course He does.
VOICE
The inner voice that tells you it’s
right——it comes from God, my son.
Eddie glances at his watch again.
EDDIE
Yeah, got it.
VOICE
It’s His way of saying that——
EDDIE
(rising)
Yeah yeah, I got it.
EXT. CALVARY - DAY
Autolochus is gazing up and off-camera as we pull him through
a crowd of Israelites, his face transfigured in wonderment.
As he reaches the front of the crowd he sinks to his knees.
The camera pulls up and away to frame him before three
crucifixes on the mount.
Gracchus, familiar from our epic’s first scene, approaches.

113.
GRACCHUS
Why on your knees before this
Hebrew, Autolochus?
Baird rises, turning his attention to his friend and placing
a comradely hand on his shoulder.
AUTOLOCHUS
I encountered him before, Gracchus,
beside the well of Jehosaphat. And
what manner of man!
Gracchus doesn’t understand:
GRACCHUS
He is a priest of the Israelites,
despised even by the other priests.
AUTOLOCHUS
No. On yesterday’s march, punished
by the dust of the road, I sought
to drink first at the well——before
the slaves in my charge, whose
thirst was greater than my own.
GRACCHUS
(uncomprehending)
A Roman drinks before a slave.
AUTOLOCHUS
This man was giving water to all.
He saw no Romans, no slaves. He saw
only men——weak men——and gave
succour. He saw suffering, which he
sought to ease. He saw sin, and
gave love.
GRACCHUS
“Love,” Autolochus?
AUTOLOCHUS
He saw my own sin, and greed, and
thirst, Gracchus. But in his eyes
I saw no shadow of reproach. I saw
only light. The light of God.
GRACCHUS
You mean, of the gods.
Autolochus gravely shakes his head.

114.
AUTOLOCHUS
I do not, friend Gracchus. This
Hebrew is son of the one God, the
God of this far-flung tribe. And
why shouldn't God's anointed appear
here, among these strange people,
in this strange place? Here,
Gracchus, in this sundrenched land.
Why should he not take this
form——the form of an ordinary man?
A man bringing us not the old
truths, but a new one.
Gracchus, is willing to believe, but is confused.
GRACCHUS
A new truth?
AUTOLOCHUS
A truth beyond the truth that we
can see. A truth beyond this
world, a truth told not in words
but in light.
Gracchus’s chin crimps as he juts his jaw, absorbing this
message.
A truth we can see if we have
but...
Autolochus is staring at Gracchus. His eyes slowly narrow to
a squint. His jaw drops open as he stares. After a beat of
fixed staring:
AUTOLOCHUS (CONT’D)
... if we have but——but——
DIRECTOR
CUT. Cut. Faith. Have but faith.
BAIRD
Faith! Faith? Not, um——
DIRECTOR
No, they changed it.
BAIRD
Goddamnit. Sorry, I’ll get it,
don’t worry.
GRACCHUS
Could I get a pat down, I’m
sweating like a pig.

EXT. CAPITOL LOT - DAY
EDDIE MANNIX AND NATALIE
They stride across the lot, Natalie following Eddie with her
notepad as at the beginning of the movie.
NATALIE
Gloria DeLamour checked herself out
of Our Lady of Perpetual Rest and
showed up for work in good shape.
Nn.

EDDIE

NATALIE
Still raining in Gallup, New
Mexico, and the “Tucumcari!” crew
has shot all the plates we need for
“Came the Rain.”
EDDIE
Then——just shoot the showdown in
the weather and we’ll retitle it
“Tucumcari Tempest” “Desert Squall”
“Hold Back the Storm”...
He momentarily casts about.
VOICE-OVER
The stories begin. The stories end.
EDDIE
I dunno——bounce it off the writers.
VOICE-OVER
So it has been.
NATALIE
Check. Here’s today’s call list.
She hands a sheet forward. He studies it, hands it back.
EDDIE
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy at the
Lockheed Corporation.
NATALIE
Long call, short?
EDDIE
“Thanks but no thanks”——how long
was that?

116.
VOICE-OVER
But the story of Eddie Mannix——
NATALIE
Check. Who do we call first?
VOICE-OVER
——will never end.
Eddie pushes back a sleeve to look at his watch.
EDDIE
New York first. Time to check in
with Mr. Schenk.
VOICE-OVER
For his is a tale written... in
light everlasting.
As they head up the walk to the administration building we
boom up to bring into view the skyline of the lot beyond. In
the middle distance is the Capitol Pictures water tower, one
word painted on its face: BEHOLD.
A slanting sun, hidden by clouds, sends down golden beams.
