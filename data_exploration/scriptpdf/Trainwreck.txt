EXT. GARAGE - DUSK
FLASHBACK: AMY and KIM, ages nine and five, sitting on the
hood of the car. Kim holds a doll. GORDON is in front of
them.
GORDON
Girls, your mother and I are
getting divorced. Don’t cry. I know
you’re upset. I know you’re
confused. I don’t know what you’re
mother told you, but let me explain
it from my side in terms you can
understand. You got your doll,
right? You got your doll there.
Yeah.

KIM

GORDON
You like your doll, right? You love
your doll.
Yeah.

KIM

GORDON
You love the doll. But what if I
told you that was the only doll you
were allowed to play with the rest
of your life? How would you feel?
Sad.

KIM

GORDON
You’d feel sad of course because
there’s a lot of other dolls on
your shelf. And if you play with
the other dolls you can’t have that
doll anymore. Even though that doll
doesn’t really want to play with
you at this point. You’re both
living a lie. There’s other dolls
you like and they’re making new
dolls every year. You want a
stewardess doll?
Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
What about a slightly overweight
cocktail waitress doll?

2.

Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
What about a doll who happens to be
best friends with your main doll?
Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
It could happen, right?
Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
What about a doll you only play
with one day and never see again?
Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
What about if your friend’s playing
with a doll and needs you to kind
of man up with the other doll? You
don’t even want to play with that
doll, but you do it because your
friend’s playing with that doll and
you don’t want to sit there and
leave the other doll unattended.
Yeah.

AMY & KIM

GORDON
So that’s why me and Mom are
getting divorced. Monogamy isn’t
realistic.
AMY AND KIM
(chanting)
Monogamy isn’t realistic.
Again.

GORDON

AMY & KIM
Monogamy isn’t realistic.
Again.

GORDON

SUPER: 23 YEARS LATER
INT. OLI’S HOUSE - NIGHT
One bedroom. Shitty “Scarface” poster on the wall. Pieced
together furniture. Dirty fish tank. BOD body spray. AMY and
OLI (handsome 30’s) are kissing hard and drunk.
AMY
I never do this. This is so weird
for me.
Amy pulls out a variety of condoms from a little wallet. Oli
strips down.
AMY (CONT’D)
I really like these ones. Oh no.
Shit. That’s your dick?
Uh huh.

OLI

AMY
Too big. Your dick doesn’t end. Why
doesn’t your dick end? Have you
ever fucked someone before? Where
is she buried? That looks like the
whole cast of Game of Thrones.
Come here.

OLI

They kiss on the bed.
AMY
You know what? I’m like really shy,
so we should probably do this first
till I feel comfortable with you.
OLI
Kind of a warm up, I know.
taste like mango.

You

AMY
Just stop talking, ok? Just do the
alphabet. Hang up at the top.
Everything important’s up at the
top.
She is close. It seems like it is going to be very climactic.
She comes. It is quick and short, and then she passes out
cold and lightly snores.

4.
OLI
Amy? Hey, I think it’s my turn.
She continues to snore. Oli rolls over to sleep.
Amy smiles. She is awake.
AMY (V.O.)
Hey guys, I’m Amy. Don’t judge me
fuckers. I’m just a sexual girl. I
am fine. I am in control.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Short shots of different guys leaving her apartment.
AMY (V.O.)
This is clearly not my first rodeo.
The key is to never ever let them
sleep over.
ONE-NIGHT STAND GUY 1
I got a couple tix for The Black
Keys. Friday night.
Ooh, bye.

AMY

A different guy at the door.
AMY (CONT’D)
Alright, goodnight.
Another one-night stand stands at her door.
AMY (CONT’D)
Bye, goodnight.
He turns back and shrugs.
ONE-NIGHT STAND GUY 4
I guess I do love pussy.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
Amy is leaning against a dumpster kissing a GUY.
AMY (V.O.)
Look I have a great job and my
apartment’s sick.
(MORE)

5.
AMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And my friends and family are
awesome, and I’m sort of seeing
someone. This dude’s not him.
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
Amy and STEVEN leave the movies holding hands.
AMY (V.O.)
This guy is who I’m seeing. Kind
of. He’s hot right? He’s great, but
it is like fucking an ice
sculpture.
INT. OLI’S HOUSE - DAY
Amy wakes up hung over. She does not know where she is.
AMY (V.O.)
OK so I broke the sleepover rule.
Where am I? Scarface poster, ugh.
Please don’t be a dorm room, please
don’t be a dorm room.
OLI
There she is, buenos dias, baby. Oh
my god you look like an angel.
AMY
What time is it?
OLI
Like seven thirty in the morning. I
didn’t know if I should let you
sleep or make you breakfast. I
chose breakfast.
AMY
Where am I?
OLI
Oh, you’re in Staten Island, sugar.
AMY
Fuckkkkkkk!
EXT. STATEN ISLAND SIDEWALK - DAY
Amy in her gold tube top, mini skirt and high heels, lights
her one hitter as she heads to the ferry.

6.
EXT. STATEN ISLAND FERRY - DAY
Amy stands outside like Rose from “Titanic” on the front of
the Ferry, joint hanging out of her mouth.
“TRAINWRECK”
EXT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy walks past NOAM, a homeless man.
NOAM
Oh Amy there she is, my Princess.
What happened, did church let out
early?
Ha ha.

AMY

NOAM
Hey Amy, where you going, this
isn’t Planned Parenthood?
INT. S’NUFF MAG BUILDING - DAY
Amy rushes into a cool looking office building. Busy exciting
feel to it. Cool looking people.
Amy sits at her desk. NIKKI, is in the cubicle next to hers.
NIKKI
Oh my god, shut up. You have to
tell me everything about last
night. I saw your instagram. That
guy, is like so hot. He looks kind
of like a white Drake.
AMY
Ew, he was like a Puerto Rican
Gollum, I’m not talking about it.
Do you have to pee?
NIKKI
Yeah, totally.
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Amy and Nikki sit in stalls side by side but the camera stays
outside the whole time, so all we can see is their feet.

7.
AMY
Did you hear Johnny Depp is coming
into the office today?
NIKKI
Oh yeah, I’m all over that.
AMY
Which version of Johnny Depp would
you most like to have sex with?
Like which one does it for you the
most, because I can’t stop thinking
about it.
NIKKI
For me, it’s Pirates of the
Caribbean. I love a fully made up,
long haired, almost feminine
looking Johnny Depp.
AMY
Not almost, he looks like a
beautiful woman in that movie.
NIKKI
Yeah. Who would be yours?
AMY
I’m thinking an Edward Scissorhands
Johnny Depp.
NIKKI
You would get totally cut up.
AMY
Yeah, but he’d feel so bad about
it. He’d be like I’ll never leave
you. And I would get a sick
haircut. Also, Willy Wonka, bring
it on.
NIKKI
Totally, I would fuck the shit out
of Willy Wonka.
INT. S’NUFF - DAY
A conference room with old S’nuff Mag covers with headlines
like, “Do You Come Weird?” and “Beer and Gadgets.” They take
their seats. The room is mostly men, including SCHULTZ and
BRYSON.
Their boss, DIANNA (a goddess) enters.

8.
DIANNA
Ok, my babes, I want your
undivided. I’ve been looking at
your pitches and these are my
thoughts. Nikki, why are you
smiling?
NIKKI
I’m not smiling, I’m just very
nervous.
DIANNA
Stop smiling. That’s even more.
Nikki.
NIKKI
The more nervous I get the more I
smile.
DIANNA
Stop smiling. Stop it. Stop it. I’m
sick of your ginger nonsense. I
don’t want to see those nashers.
No, stop it.
DONALD, a young looking intern, puts a green tea down in
front of Dianna.
DIANNA (CONT’D)
What’s this?
BRYSON
That’s our new intern. Donald. I
thought we were getting a chick but
he’s here.
DIANNA
Welcome Donald. Welcome to S’Nuff.
Where we are teaching the strongwilled male how to think, dress,
eat, fuck. Do you like this
magazine Donald?
DONALD
Oh yeah, it’s pretty much all I
read.
DIANNA
Good answer. Look. This is ours. We
made this. What’s our demographic?
ENTIRE STAFF
Everyfuckingone.

9.
DIANNA
Thank you, you can go now.
DONALD
Thank you, it’s a big opportunity.
DIANNA
Right, pitch me. Pitch me hard.
Schultz?
SCHULTZ
I was thinking something called the
S’Nuff Guide to Beating Off at
Work. Where to do it? How to do it?
How not to get caught?
DIANNA
How to get caught?
SCHULTZ
Makes it more fun. Already started
the research.
Bryson?

DIANNA

BRYSON
I got one. You’re Not Gay, She’s
Boring.
DIANNA
Fantastic. I can see it.
BRYSON
Thank you. I have another to pitch.
Maybe a cover, I don’t know? You
Call Those Tits?
DIANNA
That’s good.
BRYSON
And then, like a where are they now
piece to the kids Michael Jackson
gave settlements to.
DIANNA
Good. That’s good, yeah.
AMY
I want to know.

10.
SCHULTZ
I play ice hockey with one of ‘em.
I’ll get an email.
DIANNA
Right, assignments. Schultz. You’re
covering the Ryan Phillippe piece.
SCHULTZ
Yes! “Crash” was epic.
AMY
I was thinking I would take a stab
at the Phillippe piece.
DIANNA
No, Ryan is in a major funk right
now. He’ll respond much better to a
male figure who isn’t attractive or
masculine.
SCHULTZ
Blam! That’s me right here.
DIANNA
Bryson, I’ve got a red mark by your
name, why is that?
BRYSON
I am pitching Dr. Aaron Conners. He
works with some of the Knicks. He’s
this incredible, young sports
physician on the rise. He just
created this revolutionary knee
insert that cuts recovery time in
half. He’s about to perform it on
Amar’e Stoudemire. It’ll be the
first time it’s ever been done on a
pro athlete. If we get this we’ll
have access to the biggest names in
sports. Lebron, Durant, Blake
Griffin.
DONALD
I’ve heard of that guy. He fixed
D’Brickashaw Ferguson’s knee?
SCHULTZ
Yeah and Metta World Peace’s. Thabo
Sefolosha owes his entire career to
that guy.
AMY
(to Nikki) Are these real names?

11.
DIANNA
What’s that Amy, I want your
thoughts.
AMY
I’m sorry, I just don’t know why we
treat these athletes like heroes
just cause they can skate fast or
kick a ball into a net. I just
think it’s weird. No offense, but I
just think that sports are stupid
and anyone who likes them is just a
lesser person. And has a small
intellect.
DIANNA
Killer. I want you to write the
piece.
What?
What?

AMY
BRYSON

AMY
Oh no. I literally can’t stomach
sports.
DIANNA
I know. Your opposition is
perfection.
AMY
I think this feels like a Bryson
article.
BRYSON
This feels like a me article. I
pitched it.
DIANNA
Yeah, you pitched it. I’m giving it
to Amy. What’re you saying? Are you
giving me attitude here? This isn’t
a fucking medical journal.
BRYSON
I can do opposition. I can do sexy.
DIANNA
I want that. I want that hatred.
I’m giving it to Amy. Don’t sulk at
me.

12.
BRYSON
I’m not sulking.
DIANNA
This is my decision. I’m giving it
to Amy.
BRYSON
I can do sexy though.
Sorry?

DIANNA

BRYSON
Nothing, I’m fine. I’m having fun.
DIANNA
Nikki, I want you to research
whether garlic makes semen taste
any different.
NIKKI
Oh, um, how am I supposed to get..
DIANNA
Thank you. You inspire me.
SCHULTZ
(to Nikki)
It tastes the same.
Everybody starts to leave.
DIANNA
Amy! I’m not trying to punish you.
Does it feel a little like I am?
AMY
No, no I appreciate..
DIANNA
I know you want to branch out and
cover more. And you do know I am
looking for a new executive editor,
don’t you?
AMY
Yes I do know that. And I’m very
interested. I’d love to be
considered. Especially because my
dad’s house is not selling and my
sister and I had to put him into
assisted living. You would think it
was the Waldorf it’s so expensive.

13.
DIANNA
Is this your one woman show, right
now, cause I ain’t got a ticket.
Just eviscerate the piece. I’m
giving you an assignment.
Donald rushes in.
DIANNA (CONT’D)
And Amy would you to teach this
(Donald) about this (office).
Dianna uses her fingers to signal. Amy looks at Donald. He is
excited. Dianna exits.
DONALD
So does she have a foreign accent
or is she just awesome?
Amy gives him an annoyed look.
AMY
Don’t talk to me for two weeks.
EXT. GORDON’S HOME - DAY
GORDON’S small house in the suburbs of Queens. Amy’s sister
KIM is carrying boxes and bags to the curb. Realtor sign on
the lawn. Kim and Amy walk toward the garage as they talk.
AMY (V.O.)
That’s my sister Kim. She’s cute,
right? Well back off, she’s totally
married as fuck. We’re moving our
dad out today. He needs 24 hour
care in his fifties, so he has to
live with all these elderly people.
KIM
That stuff’s Goodwill, that stuff’s
ebay and this stuff up here is
trash.
AMY
This stuff’s ebay?
Yeah.

KIM

AMY
I wanna go through this.

14.
KIM
Don’t go through it, that’s stuff
we can make money off of.
AMY
Why are they here?
TOM and ALLISTER play in the yard.
KIM
They’re picking me up.
ALLISTER
Mother look we got a croquet set.
KIM
Great job, sweet pea.
AMY
He calls you mother? That’s creepy.
KIM
Yeah, it’s his choice.
AMY
Let him call you stepmother. It’s
more accurate.
KIM
I raised that child.
Allister runs in.
ALLISTER
Mom I found a glove.
AMY
Hey buddy, how you doin?
Good.

ALLISTER

AMY
What’re you studying in school?

15.
ALLISTER
We’re learning about space and all
the celestial objects and you know
how there are planets and solar
systems and sometimes there could
be multiple universes but people
don’t know how to describe that yet
but it’s a new theory and I’m so
excited to see if they figure it
out or not.
AMY
Great. See ya round.
Ok.

ALLISTER

Allister walks outside.
AMY
Why’s he dressed like Colonel
Sanders?
KIM
He got to dress himself and that’s
what he chose. That’s what the
inside of his heart looks like. Be
nice.
AMY
Can you just be real for a second,
if you met that dude at a CVS,
you’d have a real problem with him.
KIM
Can you just pretend to like him?
AMY
I am pretending. Ooh I like Tom’s
sweater. He’s doing the To Catch a
Predator look.
Amy!

KIM

Tom approaches.
TOM
Amy what’s up?
Hey.

AMY

16.
TOM
So good to see you.
AMY
You too, looking sharp.
TOM
I just read your article about how
to talk your girlfriend into a
three way.
AMY
You read that one?
Yeah.
Wow.

TOM
AMY

TOM
(To Kim)
Would you do that?
No.

KIM

AMY
That got off the table quick. Let
him do what he wants. You guys
should make a sex tape.
I would.
Noo..

TOM
KIM

TOM
I did high school theater. I think
I’d be pretty good at it.
INT. DAD’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Amy is looking at a brochure for the home.
AMY
This nursing home is nice.
KIM
It’s too nice and it’s too
expensive. We should have put him
in a shithole.

17.
AMY
We did. This is a shithole, it’s
just the nicest shithole. Places
where the nurses don’t fuck the
patients are expensive. That’s what
you’re paying for. Not the food
sister.
They go through boxes and throw some stuff in the trash. Kim
pulls something out of a box.
KIM
Eww. Condoms ribbed for HIS
pleasure?
AMY
Eww. I better hold onto these.
KIM
Is this coke?
AMY
No. Dad didn’t love coke, he was
just a full blown alcoholic.
(sniffs it) No, must just be from a
Halloween costume.
Kim throws out Gordon’s things.
AMY (CONT’D)
Whoa whoa whoa, let’s just..
KIM
Moving on. Don't touch it.
AMY
These are his memories.
KIM
No, don’t do that. We have so much
stuff to go through.
AMY
What, he needs his wallet.
Kim rolls open a Mets poster.
Aw.

KIM

AMY
He loves that poster.

18.

I know.

KIM

Kim rips a poster slowly while smiling at Amy. Amy tries to
grab it but Kim dodges and taunts her.
AMY
Kimberly. Stop it. Come on. Stop
it. Not cool girl.
KIM
That felt good.
Kim throws away a snow globe.
AMY
No don’t throw away his snowglobes.
These are his memories. He got one
everywhere he went.
KIM
Did he get one from every one of
our teachers because I don’t see
them.
AMY
He didn’t fuck all of our teachers.
KIM
He fucked all of my teachers.
AMY
No he never fucked Mr. Hecht. I
did. I’m just kidding. No he
wouldn’t, but..
Kim is looking through pictures. Kim finds a photo of their
mom.
KIM
Aw. Look at this. Mom was so
fuckable then.
AMY
She had the best tits. When she
would lay down, they would just
stay put. Mine are just like, see
ya. My tities are like peace.
KIM
Dad was such a dick.

19.
AMY
Yeah I don’t really see it that
way.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy and Steven are having sex.
AMY
Can we mix it up a little bit? Will
you talk dirty to me? Come on.
STEVEN
Amy, no. That’s not something I do
well at. OK? I’m more physical in
how I communicate.
AMY
You’re gonna be great at it.
STEVEN
I’m gonna sound stupid. I don’t
want to sound stupid.
AMY
You’re not gonna sound stupid.
Clear your mind and say whatever
pops in it. Just try it. Just say
anything.
STEVEN
I’m gonna give you my full pecker.
OK.

AMY

STEVEN
Because of the pecs, but pecker is
kind like my dick.
AMY
I understood what you meant by
pecker.
STEVEN
I’m gonna fill you with protein.
Give you the protein you need to
survive. Making muscles. I’m gonna
put my green drink in you. Beta
keratin and vegetable mix.

20.
AMY
Can it not be about protein or
energy or nutrition? Can you talk
about like sex stuff?
Alright.

STEVEN

AMY
Yes, OK, just sexy stuff. Talk to
me.
STEVEN
There’s no “i” in team, but there’s
an “i” in win. You can’t spell
victory without t-r-y. Winning
isn’t everything, it’s the only
thing.
AMY
These are all just phrases, like
sports phrases. Are these Nike
slogans? Please.
STEVEN
Do you want just do it, do you want
that one?
AMY
No. Just have sex with me and say
some dirty shit.
Steven says something in Chinese.
AMY (CONT’D)
What is that?
STEVEN
I’m talking to you dirty in
Chinese. That’s what I’m doing.
What?

AMY

STEVEN
I’ve been studying Mandarin in my
off time. (speaks Chinese again)
Do you need to go to the bathroom?
AMY
Please don’t speak Chinese or
whatever during sex.

21.
STEVEN
Ok, I got it.
AMY
I’m sorry I don’t mean to be so
picky. You look discouraged and
you’re doing great.
STEVEN
I told you I wasn’t going to be any
good at this. Can we try something
else?
AMY
Yeah. Talk about the first time you
saw me.
STEVEN
That’s easy. I remember it like it
was yesterday. I was just getting
done in the gym. You were leaving
that pizza place, remember?
Yeah.

AMY

STEVEN
Yeah and you were holding onto that
box. And you walked out and you
were wearing those jeans. Oh god
they looked so good. From behind
you looked like a dude.
What?

AMY

Steven orgasms which you can only tell because his eyes bulge
out of his head and he makes a little pained noise. He
collapses and wraps his arms around her and smiles.
STEVEN
Don't move. Don’t move. Don’t move
at all. Don’t move at all anything.
Ah, you’re moving your arm. Fudge
ripple ice cream! Yeah. That was
great. We got to make that part of
our program. You’re really on to
something.
He high fives her.
STEVEN (CONT’D)
Amy, don’t forget to hydrate babe.

22.
Amy just stares ahead. She looks over at him. He is chugging
a gallon of water in the bathroom with a small washcloth over
his raised penis.
STEVEN (CONT’D)
We went verbal. The boys make the
noise.
EXT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Noam panhandles.
NOAM
Yes I’m loving it, rastaman.
Digging it. With the rolling bag,
mixed messages. Come back over
here, I love you on Glee.
Amy walks up.
AMY
How’s it going?
NOAM
Amy, what’s happening?
AMY
You got a new sign?
The sign says: “I blame you” on one side and “Lift me up” on
the other.
NOAM
Yeah you know I'm working a couple
ideas out.
AMY
I’m going to visit my dad.
NOAM
Oh how is he?
AMY
Eh, we put him in an assisted
living facility, I don’t know how
nice it is actually.
NOAM
I know exactly how you feel. The
car I take a shit in, they towed
it.

23.
AMY
Sucks. Sorry man, I’ll see you
later.
NOAM
See you later, I’ll be here. Hey,
I’m digging that back camel-toe.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING TV ROOM - DAY
GORDON (late 50s), in a wheelchair, eating animal crackers.
Others in the room are very old. Gordon and Amy watch TV.
NORMAN (99) has the floor, sits with MAX.
NORMAN
What a ridiculous statement, you’re
talking about the most talented
player on all levels. None of these
bums are the equal of Babe Ruth.
GORDON
Norman, Babe Ruth was awful.
Stop it.

AMY

NORMAN
How could you negate facts?
AMY
Be nice to him.
GORDON
I am nice to him. He’s not nice to
me.
NORMAN
Babe Ruth was a superhero. He was
Superman.
GORDON
It’s easy to be Superman when
you’ve never played against a black
guy your whole life.
NORMAN
What does white, black got to do
with it?
GORDON
Every twelve year-old in the
Dominican Republic right now could
probably beat Babe Ruth.

24.
NORMAN
Blah blah blah blah blah.
GORDON
Before 1947 it’s one big asterisk.
AMY
Can you just keep a low profile for
like two weeks here?
GORDON
Oh I’m sorry I don’t want to offend
any of these people, fucking each
other with viagra day and night,
God forbid.
AMY
Can you just be nice and make
friends?
GORDON
After seven o’clock, after dinner
it turns into Caligula around here,
trust me. It’s a madhouse. Like
the Playboy Mansion for Chrissakes.
AMY
This place?
GORDON
Yes. You got my Mets stuff?
Yeah.
Amy?

AMY
GORDON

AMY
I’ll bring it by.
GORDON
Amy? Look at me. Amy.
AMY
Kim made me throw a lot of it away.
GORDON
Kim made you. Your little sister.
AMY
She’s mean as a dog.

25.

Jesus.

GORDON

AMY
I tried. I’m so sorry.
GORDON
What do I care, it’s all
memorabilia? I’m memorabilia at
this point.
AMY
Don't say that.
INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY
Amy walks through the lobby.
INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY
Amy knocks on the door. DR. AARON CONNERS is at his desk.
AMY
Dr. Conners?
Hi.

AARON

AMY
Hi. Amy Townsend.
AARON
Great to meet you.
AMY
Thank you so much for letting me
come in.
Amy sits across from Aaron in his office.
AARON
How does this work?
AMY
Today’s really just to go over
schedules.
Oh ok.

AARON

AMY
If that’s cool.

26.
AARON
Yeah. That’s great. I have never
been interviewed for a magazine.
LEBRON JAMES pops his head in while knocking.
Hey..

LEBRON JAMES

AARON
Hey Lebron.
LEBRON
Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt.
Did I leave my sunglasses here?
AARON
I don’t know. Did you?
LEBRON JAMES
I was sitting...
LeBron spots them.
LEBRON JAMES (CONT’D)
Here they are.
He grabs his glasses off the couch.
AARON
Did you just drive forty minutes
back here to look for your
sunglasses?
LEBRON JAMES
Yeah, of course. You think I’m
gonna give Sunglass Hut another
thirty dollars for these? You
crazy? Hey, how you doing?
Hi.

AMY

AARON
Your watch costs more than my
apartment.
LEBRON JAMES
This? This was a gift. We watching
“Downton Abbey” later?

27.
AARON
If I get out of here on time, yeah
we could watch it. If not let’s do
it tomorrow.
LEBRON JAMES
What? Listen I’m watching it
tonight. Cause I’m not going to
practice in the morning and all the
guys are talking about it and I’m
left out.
AARON
Do what you got to do.
LEBRON JAMES
Can you validate my parking please?
AARON
I don’t validate. You should talk
to Cheryl.
Aaron points to the reception area.
LEBRON JAMES
Ok, take care. Nice meeting you.
LeBron exits.
AARON
Bye Lebron. Thanks buddy.
LEBRON JAMES (O.C.)
Cheryl, can you validate my parking
please?
Tall.

AMY

AARON
Yeah I know, right? Did you know
who that was?
AMY
Yeah I know, he’s a basketball
player.
AARON
He’s Lebron James. He’s kind of
like “the” basketball player.
AMY
Oh yeah I think I saw one of his
soda commercials.

28.
AARON
You follow sports?
AMY
Oh my God, sports. I love them.
AARON
Who’re your favorite teams?
AMY
The, uh, I like smaller teams, like
not the big leagues. Like the Long
Island... Mediums. The Acorn...
Pinecones.
AARON
I haven’t heard of them.
AMY
The Fire Island Penguins. I like
the Cincinnati Thunderwizards.
AARON
You can stop.
AMY
The Orlando... Blooms.
AARON
You can stop. You don’t follow
sports.
AMY
I’m sorry, I don’t. I don’t know
anything about sports.
AARON
That’s okay. I didn’t really follow
sports either until I got into this
field, to be honest.
AMY
Really? Oh my God you have no idea
what a huge relief that is. I was
assigned this, this was not even my
pitch.
AARON
Right, so you’re doing the article
on me?
Uh huh.

AMY

29.

Awesome.

AARON

AMY
I think they’re just kind of weird
and strange. Grown men, wearing
jerseys with another man’s name on
it. Like are you in jail? Are you
his bitch?
Aaron points a framed jersey on his wall.
AARON
Kind of like that one?
AMY
That’s different because it’s in a
frame.
AARON
I think sports brings people
together and forms a community.
AMY
That’s what I was saying.
AARON
Obviously. I’ll tell you another
thing that’s great about this job
is that I work with a lot of
athletes, which means I work with a
lot of...
Amy looks around. Lots of pictures of him and black athletes.
AMY
... Black people?
AARON
Injuries. What did you just say?
Did you say black people?
No.

AMY

AARON
Do you have a problem with black
people?
AMY
No, I love black people. I prefer
black people.

30.
AARON
Do you have black friends?
AMY
Endless black friends.
AARON
Can you show me pictures of your
black friends on your phone?
AMY
You wanna see pictures on my phone
of my black friends?
AARON
You gotta have a lot of them.
AMY
I have so many. I’m just deciding
which one because there’s so many.
Here we go.
AARON
Great let’s see.
AMY
You’re gonna be eating your words.
You ready?
I’m ready.

AARON

AMY
OK. Black friend.
AARON
That is you and a white friend and
that is a waiter. Pouring your
water.
AMY
Let me find another one, oh wait my
phone died. Alright, well, I’ll
just let you go back to doctoring.
Great.

AARON

AMY
I’ll talk to your...
Cheryl.

AARON

31.
AMY
Cheryl, about when we can meet
again.
Great.

AARON

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
On screen: title sequence of a Noah Baumbach-y black and
white indie movie. Daniel Radcliffe in The Dogwalker. DANIEL
is walking eight dogs, leashes clipped to a dogwalker belt.
DANIEL RADCLIFFE
No we’re not going into the park.
Amy approaches Steven who is sitting in the theater.
AMY
Sorry I’m late.
STEVEN
No, that’s ok.
AMY
What is the movie?
STEVEN
Daniel Radcliffe is a dog-walker.
But he’s got a chip on his
shoulder. A real edge. Sundance
loved it.
On screen:
MARISA TOMEI
What’s your technique?
DANIEL RADCLIFFE
I put them on a leash and walk
them.
Amy pulls out a small box of wine and takes a swig.
Amy.
What’s up?

STEVEN
AMY

STEVEN
Is that wine in a box?

32.
AMY
I have a red too.
GUY IN THEATER
Is this guy ever gonna shut up?
AMY
Please watch the movie.
STEVEN
Stop, that’s not right don’t do
this to me.
AMY
What? Why’s he yelling?
STEVEN
You always do this to me. You show
up at places, and I’m a big guy,
everyone wants to fight the big
guy.
GUY IN THEATER
Hey, Mark Wahlberg, shut your bitch
up.
STEVEN
Mark Wahlberg? Me?
GUY IN THEATER
Who else looks like Mark Wahlberg?
Your girl?
STEVEN
Mark Wahlberg’s like a hundred and
fifty pounds. I’m two hundred and
fifty lean. I look like Mark
Wahlberg ate Mark Wahlberg.
GUY IN THEATER
Your muscles aren’t the fucking
problem. It’s your yapping
girlfriend.
AMY
Just say fuck you.
STEVEN
I will fuck you. Alright? I will
enter you.
GUY IN THEATER
You’re gonna enter me? Did you hear
what he said?

33.
AMY
What are you talking about right
now?
STEVEN
I’m just trying to intimidate him.
AMY
You’re just talking about raping
him.
GUY IN THEATER
You’re not about that life champ. I
can see it.
STEVEN
I am about that life.
GUY IN THEATER
No you’re not.
STEVEN
No I am about that life. You like
movies? I will make a movie. We’ll
make Momma Said Knock You Out
starring my fist and your dick
hole.
GUY IN THEATER
Oh shit, what the fuck is wrong
with this dude?
WOMAN IN THEATER
He wants you.
AMY
Babe, your threats I’m telling you
are super gay.
STEVEN
Too sexual?
Yeah.

AMY

GUY IN THEATER
This has to be the corniest muscled
white dude I’ve ever seen in my
fucking life.
STEVEN
Ok Coco Beware, you’re being an
asshole. You know what I do with
assholes? I lick them.

34.
GUY IN THEATER
What the fuck?
WOMAN IN THEATER
He wants to fuck you.
EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
Amy smokes from her one-hitter.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
MARISA TOMEI
My pooch has been hurt more than
enough.
DANIEL RADCLIFFE
I will make sure no one ever hurts
your pooch again.
Amy sits back down. Starts eating popcorn.
AMY
What’d I miss?
STEVEN
Amy, what did I miss?
Steven has Amy’s phone in his right hand. It is lit up.
AMY
They pre-butter it.
STEVEN
Who’s Brody?
What?

AMY

STEVEN
Who’s Oli? Who’s Brody?
AMY
Why do you have my cellphone?
She reaches for it. He keeps it. She starts smiling.
STEVEN
Why are you smiling?

35.
AMY
I get a little high outside, like
barely a little high.
STEVEN
While you were getting high I was
putting your phone on silent for
the movie and noticed you have all
these guys in your phone. Brody. Or
this guy listed as Hot As Balls.
Who the fuck is Hot As Balls? Stop
smiling.
AMY
I’m not smiling, those are guys
from work. Could we just watch this
movie?
STEVEN
You know what, no I can’t, because
as I was turning off your phone, I
got a picture of somebody’s dick.
GUY IN THEATER
It was mine.
STEVEN
Fuck you Tone Loc, you wanna take
it to the parking lot? Fine, You
can’t find me I’ll be the closest
one on Grindr.
Steven walks out of the theater. Amy shakes her head.
AMY
That’s gay!
EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
Amy is chasing Steven down the street.
AMY
Steven, please. I am not in shape
for this. Stop walking like the
Hulk I can see that you’re mad.
You’re being crazy.
STEVEN
Am I? Cause I think you owe me an
explanation about this. Do I have
to worry about you and other guys?

36.
AMY
I’m just so high right now. Let’s
just talk tomorrow. I’m too fucked
up.
STEVEN
Amy, you’re always fucked up.
Answer the question. Are you
hooking up with other guys?
He holds her there for a moment until she finally speaks.
AMY
We never said we were exclusive.
STEVEN
Fuck. Exclusive? Amy it’s not high
school. Every single guy I work out
with, every single guy, says all
you’re gonna do is mess with my
emotions and hurt me.
AMY
You guys talk about that at the
gym?
STEVEN
Fuck Amy do I have to worry about
you with other guys?
AMY
Yes, I hook up with other guys. I
don’t go to the movies with them.
That’s our special thing.
STEVEN
I’m so fucking stupid. You know
what the sad part is? I was gonna
ask you to marry me.
AMY
Really? I didn’t even think you
liked me very much. Why are you
making me feel bad about this? You
can sleep with other girls. That’s
like every guy’s dream.
STEVEN
It’s not this guy’s dream. Yeah
this guy’s got a dream. And it’s us
making it. Getting married, moving
out to the countryside. Having a
family. Three boys and two more
boys. Enough for a basketball team.
(MORE)

37.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
And I’ll develop a cross-fit
program and patent it. And I’ll
rule the cross-fit world with you
by my side. My cross-fit queen.
That’s my dream.
AMY
Hey. Hey. Can I leave? Or can you
leave? I’m just very high, and I
just need this interaction to be
over.
STEVEN
Are you serious? Fuck you Amy. You
are not nice.
Steven walks away.
AMY
I’m totally nice.
INT. ALICE’S TEA CUP - DAY
Amy and Kim sit at sewing tables with tiny tea cups.
KIM
Maybe you should consider changing
your ways.
My ways?

AMY

KIM
You would love having a family.
AMY
You sound like Steven. I wish I
could break up with you.
KIM
Having a family is fun.
AMY
That’s fun?
Yeah.

KIM

Cut to Tom and Allister eating tiny cucumber sandwiches and
drinking tea.
KIM (CONT’D)
They’re having a boy’s lunch.

38.

Here?
Hi ladies.

AMY
WAITER

AMY
We’re going to have two mimosas.
Kim shakes her head no.
AMY (CONT’D)
You’re right, hold the orange
juice. No orange juice, too much
sugar.
WAITER
So, champagne.
Oh, okay!

AMY

KIM
No champagne for me.
AMY
Two champagnes. Ok we’ll see you in
a bit.
WAITER leaves.
AMY (CONT’D)
Oh my god, he’s like dying to fuck
me. Wait. Why aren’t you drinking?
Have a drink with me.
Kim smiles at Amy.
AMY (CONT’D)
What? No. You’re pregnant?
KIM
I’m pregnant. Tom’s the father.
Ew.

AMY

Tom and Allister gives Amy a thumbs up.
AMY (CONT’D)
They look like they’re on a speed
date.

39.
KIM
Say congratulations.
AMY
We’re telling dad.
KIM
I’ll tell him at the new nursing
home. The one that’s cheaper.
AMY
It’s not ok. You’re telling him.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING DINING ROOM - DAY
Amy, Gordon, Norman and Kim sit in a cafeteria-like rec room.
GORDON
Are you serious? Oh my God,
congratulations. You’re pregnant?
Come here.
Kim is warmed by this.
GORDON (CONT’D)
Oh my God, I’m tingling right now.
I feel high. That’s incredible. I’m
finally gonna be a grandfather.
KIM
You’re already a grandfather.
Not yet.
Allister.

GORDON
AMY

GORDON
What’s that?
Allister.

AMY

GORDON
What about him?
AMY
That’s your grandson.

40.
GORDON
Allister? No, I mean, Allister’s
your step child and my step
grandkid I guess. I’m talking about
your kid. Our bloodline.
NORMAN
I was the first kid on my block to
own a television.
AMY
That’s really not relevant right
now, Norman.
GORDON
That’s more like Tom’s kid. Tom’s
kid who you help with.
AMY
Dad, you love Allister.
GORDON
I like him. I care for him. I fear
for him. I know what happens to a
kid like that in the schoolyard. We
had a kid like that, Stewie. We
used to beat him mercilessly. Some
days I almost felt bad for him.
That’s what’s gonna happen to this
kid. I’m trying to protect him.
Teach him how to be a man.
KIM
I don’t know what you are talking
about. You were the worst father
ever.
GORDON
Come on, I wasn’t a bad father.
KIM
Mom did everything when we were
growing up. You wouldn’t understand
because you weren’t there.
GORDON
So now you’re mother’s a saint?
KIM
Of course she’s a saint.
GORDON
Of course because when you die
everybody’s a saint.

41.
AMY
Dad. Just shut up.
GORDON
We were just talking about this
yesterday. About Allister.
Amy?

KIM

AMY
No he’s lying.
Amy.

KIM

GORDON
Amy, come on, you said he’s the
kind of kid who drops his pants to
the floor when he pees at the
urinal.
AMY
No, you said that. I said he
probably pees sitting down.
GORDON
That was funny.
KIM
I can’t believe you guys are
teaming up against me again.
AMY
No, I’m on your side. I’m on your
team!
KIM
You’re not on my team.
GORDON
I’m sorry if I’m more excited about
my grandkid than some stepgrandkid.
KIM
They’re both your grandkid, God
damnit.
Kim walks off.
AMY
Kimberly, come--

42.
NORMAN
Was that your wife?
INT. REHABILITATION FACILITY - DAY
Aaron works on a PATIENT.
AMY
What is this speech you have to
make for Doctors With Borders?
AARON
Without. Doctors Without Borders.
Oh right.

AMY

AARON
Doctors Without Borders. It’s a
really good organization. We go to
places with conflict, big
disasters. And we help people.
AMY
You help people by choice, and
that’s what you like?
AARON
It’s great work. It’s very
rewarding helping these people.
Wow.

AMY

(to Patient)
What’s your story? Are you a
Division One athlete or something?
PATIENT
No, no. I was on the XBox that I
was playing, but then I got really
high and tripped on my bong.
AMY
Are you high right now?
PATIENT
Yeah. So high.
AARON
There you go, I think you got your
new article.

43.
AMY
Here we go.
INT. REHABILITATION FACILITY - ELSEWHERE - DAY
Amy and Aaron are walking around the rehabilitation facility.
AARON
This is our Sports Performance
Center. This is where most of our
athletes come and do their
rehabilitation.
Amy picks up a ball.
AMY
What does this do?
She throws it against a trampoline. It bounces back almost
hitting her.
INT. TRAINING CENTER - DAY
Amy is on a treadmill in a black leotard with reflective
white dots all over her body. Her avatar is projected on a
screen on the wall. Aaron is looking at her movements on the
monitor. She is having trouble moving around in it.
AARON
The HBN shows how your muscles are
working and moving so your rehab is
most effective. It can help you
with your posture, your gait.
My gait?

AMY

AARON
Just walk normal for a second.
AMY
This looks pretty good.
AARON
Walk naturally for one second.
Amy struts.
AMY
Like this? I look like Beyonce.
People always think I’m her, we
share an instagram.

44.
AARON
Is that how you walk down the
street?
AMY
No this is how I walk. I think the
screen’s doing different stuff than
I’m doing.
Amy marches with her arm extended.
AARON
What we can do is show how to fix
your posture and your gait. I
really wouldn’t do a Hitler march.
AMY
Like this? Alright sorry, I’m
listening.
We good?

AARON

AMY
Yeah. Wait who is this? Ready watch
the screen.
Who?

AARON

She limps and then starts to run.
AMY
Kevin Spacey at the end of Usual
Suspects.
AARON
I didn't see that movie.
AMY
Oh, he’s Keyser Soze. That’s not
important. It’s not a spoiler.
AARON
So why don’t you pick up the speed
a little bit. That’s good. Get a
nice jog going. A little faster.
There you go. See how your legs are
lighting up green. You can go a
little faster. See that’s real
nice.
A text from Kim. “Call me to talk about plans for Dad.” She
starts getting claustrophobic.

45.
AARON (CONT’D)
See you're landing on your heel you
wanna land on the ball of feet.
Like that. See that’s real good.
AMY
Can you, how do you stop?
She is panicking. Aaron helps her off the machine gently. He
sits her down.
AARON
Whoa, whoa, you’re
hyperventilating.
AMY
Can you get this off?
Amy hyperventilates and Aaron coaches her how to breathe.
AARON
Yeah. Look at me. Deep breath in.
Blow it out like a birthday candle.
That’s good, slow it down. You’re
just hyperventilating. Just take
your time. You alright?
AMY
I’m hungry. I haven’t eaten much
today. I had basically Lay’s potato
chips. Stopped in Starbucks, one
red velvet, a yogurt, two scones
but they were super small. And some
Chipotle. But that stuff runs
through you.
AARON
So you had breakfast, lunch and a
snack?
Yeah.

AMY

AARON
Let’s go get some food.
Yeah.

AMY

AARON
Let’s do that.

46.
INT. INDOCHINE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Aaron is inhaling his food and talking while eating. He is
nervous and trying to do a good job on their interview/date.
AARON
My dad is a rheumatologist. My mom
is a college professor. They’re
great, but they put a lot of
pressure on me. I was their only
child. Well maybe I just put a lot
of pressure on myself because they
did such great stuff. No they put
pressure on me. Can we not put this
in the article? I don’t know why
I’m saying this. They’re great.
Aaron’s parents are great.
AMY
Aaron’s parents are great. I won’t
put any of that in the article. If
you don’t want.
AARON
Is that alright? Just off the
record.
AMY
Just so you know, if you want to
keep something out of the article,
if you want it to be off the
record, you have to tell me before.
Oh really?

AARON

AMY
Yeah, this can be retroactive, I
won’t put your parents in it. This
article is gonna be killer.
AARON
Yeah. It’s gonna be a bummer... So
I read some of your stuff.
Oh my god.

AMY

AARON
No they were really good. It was
one thing when I saw it and I was
like I don’t know, and then I
started reading it, and it was
really funny and smart. Satirical.

47.

Thank you.

AMY

AARON
It was good.
AMY
I have other stuff I’ve written for
other places. That’s the kind of
stuff they want at this magazine.
AARON
Can I read some of it?
AMY
Yeah. You can read some of my
stuff.
AARON
Do you want to get a drink?
Yeah.
OK.

AMY
AARON

(makes check signal)
Can I get the check?
AMY
He understood. Don’t do the symbol
and yell.
AARON
What do you mean?
AMY
You can mouth the word check and
not make any noise and that’s like
the best.
AARON
What do I do?
Watch.

AMY

She shows him.
AARON
Let me try.
(does the sign)
Check!

48.

No.

AMY

AARON
Am I not doing it right? Check!!
Oh my God.

AMY

AARON
Can we get the bill please, we’d
like to pay for the food?!
INT. DUBLINS - NIGHT
Amy and Aaron sit at the bar.
AARON
First kiss, girl named Jennifer
Jennifer. Halloween party, seventh
grade. She was very short. She had
to stand up on a rock to kiss me.
It was very cute like a Norman
Rockwell painting. Oh and you see
these teeth?
Yeah.

AMY

The lights go on in the bar. They notice and start to walk
out.
AARON
They’re fake. They’re porcelain.
Ron Gardner, seventh grade. I got
brand new Air Jordans. He wanted
them. Punched me in the face,
knocked out my teeth and stole my
shoes.
EXT. DUBLINS - NIGHT
Aaron is still telling the story. They are both riding this
good vibe. Amy hails a cab.
No.

AMY

AARON
You’re getting a lot of info from
me. Off the record.

49.
AMY
Off the record. Totally.
AARON
Hey today was really fun.
AMY
Today was great.
AARON
I was really nervous about it, but
it was a lot of fun.
AMY
No, this was great.
Cab stops. Amy starts to get in the cab.
AARON
If you want to come by tomorrow.
AMY
You coming?
AARON
Oh you’re going downtown?
Uh huh.

AMY

They get in the cab.
INT. TAXI - NIGHT
Aaron leans up right away and talks to the driver.
Two stops.

AARON

AMY
One stop. You want to give him your
address?
AARON
Spring and Washington?
Awkward silence as they look out their windows.
INT. AARON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
They walk through the door still talking.

50.
AARON
(babbling nervously)
This is where I live. It’s pretty
sweet. You want a drink or
anything?
No thanks.

AMY

AARON
This is the kitchen. It’s a pretty
sweet place. I’ve been here for
about a year. You know what...
Amy walks up behind him, her shirt already off.
AARON (CONT’D)
Let’s get some tunes on in this
place.
(sees Amy)
Holy Shit.
They kiss.
AARON (CONT’D)
So we’re gonna do this now?
AMY
We are gonna do this now. Is that
ok?
AARON
That’s cool.
Amy sits Aaron on the couch. They start to have sex.
AARON (CONT'D)
Holy shit. We are doing this like
right now.
AMY
We are doing it.
AARON
We are off to the races. Alright,
that’s nice. Ah man.
AMY
Oh my god. Good for you. I didn’t
see this for you.

51.
INT. AARON’S APARTMENT - LATER
They are lying in bed. He is really happy. Amy is
uncomfortable.
AMY
Ok. I’m gonna head out.
AARON
Why don’t you stay over?
AMY
No I’m not gonna stay here. You
have an early day I bet.
AARON
No it’s fine.
He wraps his arm around her and kisses her shoulder. It’s
uncomfortable. They know it but are trying to be still. They
lie there for a beat.
AARON (CONT’D)
Are you comfortable?
AMY
No. No I’m not.
Oh. Ok.

AARON

AMY
I don’t really like to spoon.
He moves.
AMY (CONT’D)
If I stay here can we sleep in a
realistic position? Cause I’m a
light sleeper. If you move or sweat
or breathe, I’ll wake me up and
I’ll be awake all night long
resenting you. So, can we just put
a pillow there. (places pillow)
This isn’t your main pillow you
use, is it?
No.

AARON

AMY
Cool, let’s just get that in there.
They lie back down.

52.
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I’m nitpicking, you’re
just breathing on me really hard.
It’s like a strong wind. Just
breathe towards the sky.
Like this?

AARON

AMY
Do it and I’ll tell you.
He breathes upward.
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m still getting like a little bit
of a wind.
Jesus.

AARON

AMY
Do you want me to go home? I can so
sleep at home.
AARON
No, this is so worth it.
INT. S’NUFF MAG - DAY
Amy is in her cubicle. Donald is staring at her taking
copious notes. Amy is annoyed and on her phone.
AMY
Nikki, hurry up and get here.
Amy hangs up her phone.
DONALD
When you’re writing an article, do
you always use a recorder?
No.

AMY

DONALD
When you’re writing an article,
what are the ten biggest mistakes
you could make?
AMY
Plagiarizing, getting drunk,
fucking someone.

53.
DONALD
When you’re writing an article,
about someone famous that you
really like, do you become their
friend?
AMY
Why would you want to be their
friend?
Schultz and Bryson walk by.
SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen any kind of
article about guys that like to
masturbate to hockey fights?
AMY
That’s not a thing.
BRYSON
See I told you.
SCHULTZ
Then why’d it work for me?
AMY
We’re in the middle of something.
Schultz and Bryson walk away.
DONALD
Seriously right? Ok, that actually
brings me to an interesting line of
questioning.
AMY
You know what, there going to want
you to just do a bunch of web
stuff. Everyone has a boner for
young people and the internet. They
think you have the key to it.
Dianna walks by. Amy turns her attention to Donald.
AMY (CONT’D)
And that’s why I’ll do anything I
can to help you here.
Dianna smiles at them. Amy smiles back. Donald is confused.
DONALD
Yeah but, when you’re writing an

AMY
Sorry talk to me about it later.
Just write them all down.
Amy follows Dianna.
Ok.

DONALD

INT. S’NUFF OFFICES - DAY

approachable.
Thank you.

DIANNA
I want this promotion for you. I
want you to help me to help you. I
need to go up there to the men
upstairs. I need you to provide me
with the ammo to know you can their
workload. Can you handle their
load?
AMY
I can handle all their loads.
Dianna walks away. Nikki walks up. They go sit on a couch.
AMY (CONT’D)
Nikki. Where have you been?
NIKKI
I was getting a smoothie.
AMY
I slept at the doctor’s place last
night.
NIKKI
Cause you were blackout drunk?
AMY
No I was dead sober. I had like two
drinks. Three max. Four now that
I’m tallying. I was sober.

55.
NIKKI
So you barely drank, cause you’re
on antibiotics or something?
AMY
No. I spent the night on purpose.
NIKKI
I don’t understand.
AMY
I don’t understand.
NIKKI
When you think about the sex, are
you just kind of-(makes a disgusted face)
AMY
No, I’m like-(makes a satisfied smile)
Nikki, smiles awkwardly, trying to make the same face.
AMY (CONT’D)
No, that’s not what I’m doing.
Amy’s phone rings. It says “Aaron Conners.”
AMY (CONT’D)
Oh my God! He’s calling.
NIKKI
Why would he call? You just had
sex.
AMY
It’s a mistake.
NIKKI
Maybe he butt-dialed you.
Amy answers.
Hello?

AMY

AARON (V.O.)
Hey there. It’s Aaron.
AMY
This is Amy. I think you just buttdialed me.

56.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Aaron and LeBron James are sitting at a table finishing up a
meal.
AARON
No, I dialed you with my fingers.
LEBRON JAMES
What’d she say?
Amy covers the phone to whisper to Nikki.
AMY
He called me on purpose.
NIKKI
Hang up. He’s obviously sick.
Amy speaks back into the phone.
What’s up?

AMY

AARON
I had a great time last night and I
want to know if you wanted to hang
out again.
Amy holds the phone up so Nikki can hear, too.
AMY
Will you say that again please?
AARON
I was wondering if I could see you
again.
NIKKI
I’m going to call the police.
AMY
(to Aaron)
I’ll talk to you about it tomorrow
at the interview.
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
LEBRON JAMES
Oh, she said yes.

57.
AARON
Alright I’ll talk to you then. Bye.
LEBRON JAMES
Oh man. That’s pretty cool. I
didn’t get to hear the whole
conversation though.
AARON
We’re gonna talk about it when we
see each other tomorrow.
LEBRON JAMES
That’s great. Did you guys make
love?
Aaron is reluctant to say.
Yeah.

AARON

LEBRON JAMES
My boy got intimate. Sexual
intercourse.
AARON
Why don’t you just announce it to
everybody?
LEBRON JAMES
My boy’s got a girlfriend. It’s
been forever.
AARON
I’m not gonna lie, it’s been a
while.
LEBRON JAMES
It’s been like six years since
Sheila and that only lasted like
five weeks.
AARON
There was Debbie.
LEBRON JAMES
Debbie didn’t even tell you where
she lived.
AARON
She thought I was a psycho. She
kept calling me Dexter.

58.
LEBRON JAMES
What I’m saying is you gotta go for
it. Focus if you wanna take it to
the next level. You got to give it
everything if you want this one.
When I lost the championship in
2011, I worked on my game twice as
hard. Worked on my post-up game.
And we won the championship. Twice.
AARON
I don’t feel like that applies to
me. But I appreciate the thought.
LEBRON JAMES
You gotta take a risk. Like when I
decided to go back to Cleveland, I
wasn’t totally sure they were gonna
welcome me back. But they did. They
welcomed me with open arms and an
open heart.
AARON
Again I feel like that applies more
to you. I don’t even live in
Cleveland. But I appreciate the
thought.
LEBRON JAMES
Cleveland, Ohio? Home of the Rock n
Roll Hall of Fame? Or maybe we go
down to Canton to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. You know Superman was
created in Cleveland.
AARON
Yes I know. You told me that
several times.
LEBRON JAMES
Did you ever see a Cuyahoga sunset?
No.

AARON

LEBRON JAMES
Did you know Cleveland’s great for
the whole family?
AARON
Yes, I do. You tell me that all the
time. You randomly text me that.

59.
LEBRON JAMES
What’s wrong with that? I’ve got
free texting.
AARON
It’s weird. Why are you always
trying to sell me on Cleveland?
LEBRON JAMES
When are you gonna come to
Cleveland?
AARON
I’ll come when I have time. I don’t
have the time right now. I’m just
really busy.
LEBRON JAMES
You visited me in Miami all the
time.
AARON
Yeah but that’s Miami.
LEBRON JAMES
What’s the difference between Miami
and Cleveland? It’s the same.
AARON
You’re right it’s the same.
Exactly.

LEBRON JAMES

LeBron looks at the bill.
LEBRON JAMES (CONT’D)
Okay you had the salmon. Fourteen
dollars.
AARON
What are you doing man?
Two Cokes.

LEBRON JAMES

AARON
Are you trying to split the bill?
LEBRON JAMES
I told you the refills weren’t
free.

60.
AARON
We’re not splitting the bill. Just
pick up the check.
LEBRON JAMES
Why do I have to pick up the check?
AARON
Because you’re Lebron James.
LEBRON JAMES
Don’t look at me different just
cause I got a little money. I don’t
how long this could last. Anything
could happen. I’m not gonna end up
like MC Hammer. You owe thirty two
dollars and forty three cents.
AARON
I’ll pay for it. But you’ve got to
pick up a check every once in a
while.
LEBRON JAMES
No. Just pay your part. It’s better
for our friendship. Equals forever.
AARON
I’ll put my credit card in. Put a
credit card in. We’ll split it.
LeBron looks for his wallet.
AARON (CONT’D)
Fuck you. Fuck you.
LEBRON JAMES
I think I left my wallet in the
car.
Fuck you.

AARON

LEBRON JAMES
It’s right in the car.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Amy’s watching Aaron perform shoulder surgery. ‘Uptown Girl’
by Billy Joel plays over speakers. Aaron hums while he works.
We hear the song. When an incision is made, a ton of fat
pours out. Amy vomits.

61.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - SCRUB AREA - DAY
Post-surgery, Amy and Aaron talk by the sinks.
AMY
So, that was disgusting.
Yeah.

AARON

AMY
Why Billy Joel? Why Uptown Girl?
AARON
I love that song.
AMY
That’s probably the worst Billy
Joel song. I’m pretty sure even
Billy Joel hates that song.
AARON
He shouldn’t, it’s great.
Ok.

AMY

AARON
So off the record, do you want to
go grab some dinner?
AMY
Yeah, Aaron I think you are so
great. But I’m a writer, I’m your
writer and you’re my subject. From
now on we need to keep it
professional. You know?
AARON
No. I think we really like each
other and we should start dating.
AMY
No. I’m saying-- I’m confused. Am I
not communicating this right?
AARON
No, I hear you. I’m saying I
disagree. Do you like me?
Yes.

AMY

62.
AARON
I really like you, so we should be
a couple.
AMY
No, no. I have plans.
AARON
What are your plans?
Dentist.

AMY

AARON
Is that true?
No.

AMY

AARON
Then let’s go out.
Her phone rings.
AMY
I'm sorry my dad’s place is
calling.
(into the phone)
Hello. Why didn’t someone help him?
I’m on my way.
(to Aaron)
My dad fell. He’s in assisted
living. I need to change.
INT. GORDON’S ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY
Amy and Aaron rush down the hall. Gordon sits on a hospital
bed, a gash on his forehead. An attendant, TEMEMBE is holding
a rag on it.
Hi baby.

GORDON

AMY
What happened?
Nothing.

GORDON

TEMEMBE
He is supposed to ring the call
button if he needs to get out of
his chair. He fell.

63.
AMY
Where’s the doctor?
TEMEMBE
They are ignoring my pages. If I
wanted to I could treat him. I was
a doctor in my country.
GORDON
I’ll let you know if the wound gets
invaded by evil spirits.
AMY
Are you in pain?
AARON
Can I take a look at it please?
Aaron starts washing his hands.
AARON (CONT’D)
It looks a lot worse than it
actually is.
GORDON
Who’s this moondoggy?
AARON
I’m Doctor Conners. Your daughter
and I just officially started
dating.
AMY
No, not officially. Not at all.
GORDON
Welcome to a very large club.
AARON
You’re going to be getting stitches
today.
GORDON
Not a chance buster. What’s the
point? Just leave it. What do I
need to look like Kate Middleton
for? I don’t give consent. No
consent.
AMY
Shut up dad.
We see the stitches going in. We show them poke through the
skin and Gordon wincing. It is disgusting.

64.
Amy and Temembe are holding Gordon’s hands while Aaron
stitches him. There is a good amount of blood. Aaron is
humming.
AARON
I need to you to stop moving.
GORDON
I feel like a pin cushion. What’s
he humming?
AMY
Billy Joel.
AARON
Uptown Girl.
GORDON
That’s the only thing that’ll save
you. I like Billy Joel. I saw him
at Nassau Coliseum. Nylon Curtain
Tour.
AARON
That’s awesome. I saw him with
Elton John at Shea Stadium. It was
great.
GORDON
Of course you did. Nothing better
than down to earth blue collar
Billy Joel with Elton John, the
Queen of England.
AARON
Amy tells me you’re a Mets fan.
GORDON
I’m a supporter of the New York
Metropolitans. What about it?
AARON
You wouldn’t mind some trivia?
GORDON
What are you trying to distract me
like a school girl getting her ears
pierced? What do you got?
AARON
Can you name the nine major league
sports teams that don’t end in the
letter S?

65.
Gordon winces a little from pain but the distraction works.
GORDON
Child’s play. Utah Jazz, Miami
Heat, Red Sox, White Sox.
Temembe pulls Amy to the side to talk.
TEMEMBE
I shouldn’t be telling you this. He
has been hoarding his pain
medication.
Aaron continues to stitch.
GORDON
Ease up Martha Stewart.
Norman wheels by.
NORMAN
Hey. Water aerobics. You coming?
GORDON
I’ll be right there.
NORMAN
Meryl’s wearing a two-piece.
GORDON
The guy died three years ago and
nobody alerted him.
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Aaron and Amy walk to his car.
AMY
Thank you so much. My dad’s really
not a bad guy. You just caught him
on an off day.
AARON
He was fine. I’ll check up on him
next week. I told him about
Tecidera. It’s a new drug that
inhibits the immune cells. I’ll
call his doctor.
Amy is overwhelmed. After a beat.
AMY
Will you please come home with me?

66.
Aaron thinks about how to respond.
Forget it.

AMY (CONT’D)

AARON
No. You know what? Let’s get some
food. Do you want to get some
raviolis? I know a place and they
have great raviolis.
AMY
I would love to get raviolis.
They kiss.
Yeah?
Yeah.

AARON
AMY

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LITERARY WALK - DAY
Amy and Kim walk. Amy looks miserable.
KIM
Stop doing that. Why are you
breathing weird?
AMY
I’m not breathing weird.
KIM
What's going on?
AMY
I like him so much. Why do I feel
so scared?
KIM
Because you’ve always dated dummies
you weren’t at risk of actually
liking.
AMY
Can we get a drink?
No.
One drink.

KIM
AMY

67.
KIM
No, stop it.
AMY
I’ve been dating for ninety years
and something always happens. Why
not this time?
KIM
What could possibly happen?
AMY
What if I forget to flush the
toilet and there’s a tampon in
there? And not like a cute, it’s
the last day-- I’m talking like a
crime scene tampon. Like Red
Wedding, Game of Thrones.
KIM
Oh my gosh.
AMY
Like a Quentin Tarantino, like a
real motherfucker of a tampon.
There’s like an ear on it. You know
what I mean? There's like
dealbreakers, you know?
Tom and Allister roller blade over.
AMY (CONT’D)
This does not seem safe.
Hi.

KIM

AMY
They’re always here.
TOM
Is Amy crying?
KIM
She’s in love.
TOM
With Steven?
No!

AMY/KIM

68.
TOM
I love Steven. He taught me this
workout to get a beach bod.
AMY
You look amazing. Really ripping it
up.
INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
Slam dunk contest. An acrobatic dunk team is up.
AMY
That was cool.
LeBron James enters.
LEBRON JAMES
Hi, I’m LeBron James and welcome to
the Big Apple Jam Fest! Are you
guys ready to have some fun?
We hear an announcement over the speaker “And now the Knicks
City Dancers!” Infuriatingly tiny, hot dancers take center
court and do a dance. Amy is grossed out.
AARON
Knicks City Dancers!
AMY
They’re just gyrating.
AARON
These girls work really hard. I
treat them.
AMY
You treat them?
AARON
I do. They get really bad injuries.
AMY
I bet. The pole isn’t always
greased right.
(towards the girls)
You’re gonna lose us the right to
vote.
The dance ends and the girls run off the court. Amy is
horrified.

69.
AMY (CONT’D)
How long is this?
AARON
I don’t know, like an hour?
AMY
I’m just asking.
One of the tiniest girls runs up to the sideline and
addresses Aaron. ALDEN, 19, gorgeous.
ALDEN
Doctor Conners! Can you take a look
at my ankle? I think I rolled it.
Yeah sure.

AARON

Aaron stands up.
AARON (CONT’D)
I’ll be right back.
LeBron approaches.
AMY
Hi. You were so great. Everyone
flipped out when you came out
there.
LEBRON JAMES
Thanks. But seriously, what’s the
deal here? What are your
intentions?
AMY
My intentions?
LEBRON JAMES
With my boy. What’s your plan?
AMY
I don’t have a plan. We’ve been
dating for six weeks. We’re just
hanging out. Keeping it cas..
LEBRON JAMES
You get butterflies when you hear
his name?
Excuse me?

AMY

70.
LEBRON JAMES
When you look in the clouds, do you
see his face? Do you hear his name
when you listen to the wind?
Um, yes.

AMY

LEBRON JAMES
I really have to ask you a
question. Don't hurt him.
LeBron stares at her.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
AMY (V.O.)
So we did it. Okay? We fell hard
for each other.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAILBOAT POND - DAY
Aaron is showing Amy how to sail his remote control sailboat.
He is wearing a captain’s hat.
AMY (V.O.)
Welcome to the whitest couple in
America. How did no one mug us that
day? Look at his hat.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
Amy and Aaron kiss on a rock.
AMY (V.O.)
Now we’re kissing on a rock. You
know how many homeless people have
taken a dump on that rock?
INT. SUBWAY - DAY
Amy and Aaron kiss.
AMY (V.O.)
Subway kissing. Ew. I love how tall
he is.

71.
EXT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Noam panhandles. Amy and Aaron pass him.
NOAM
Whoa, easy dude. I’m a working man
too, I get it.
Hey Noam.

AMY

NOAM
Whoa, inside sex. I’m digging that.
INT. GORDON’S NURSING HOME - NIGHT
Amy, Aaron, and Gordon are having a nice dinner they’ve set
up at the dining area of the assisted living facility.
AMY (V.O.)
Even my dad likes him. He doesn’t
like anyone. He thought Mother
Theresa was full of shit.
INT. AARON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy and Aaron brush their teeth.
AMY (V.O.)
That’s my Aaron’s apartment
toothbrush. I have two
toothbrushes.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy and Aaron spoon in bed.
AMY (V.O.)
I hope this love montage ends like
Jonestown.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DUSK
Amy and Aaron sit on a bench by the Queensboro Bridge.
AMY (V.O.)
Ooh, I think this is where Woody
Allen met Soon-Yi.
She leans over to give him a bj.

72.
AMY (V.O.)
Ok, easy. That was a dare. I was
dared to do that.
INT. BASKETBALL GYM - DAY
LeBron and Aaron are talking while playing one-on-one.
LEBRON JAMES
What’s up with you and Amy, how’s
that going?
AARON
Amy? Thing’s are going awesome.
Real good. I really, really like
her, but she’s got some issues.
LeBron nonchalantly grabs the ball from him with one hand,
shoots and scores.
LEBRON JAMES
That’s going to happen.
AARON
Last night we went out drinking.
You?

LEBRON JAMES

AARON
Yeah. And I got hammered. She drank
a lot and didn’t get drunk at all.
LeBron stuffs him, grabs the ball, and then dunks.
LEBRON JAMES
You using protection?
AARON
Oh yeah, of course. She’s got
little bowls of condoms around her
apartment.
LEBRON JAMES
Condoms? I’m talking protection.
About a lawyer, non disclosure
agreement. No penetration without
representation.
He dunks on Aaron again.
AARON
Yeah you’re right.

73.
LEBRON JAMES
Because you don’t want a baby mama.
Next thing you know you’re paying
for her Ferrari, a mansion. She’s
gonna want to start a jumpsuit line
and you’re gonna have to pay for
it. Do you wanna go through that?
Convince one of your friends to say
he’s the dad and raise the child.
Who wants to go through that? Kid
ends up being six seven, your
friend’s only five two. Eighteen
years later the kid comes and
writes a book about you saying how
big of a jackass you are. Eighteen
years. Your baby momma’s car and
crib is bigger than his. You can
turn on the TV any given Sunday,
win the Superbowl and drive off in
a Hyundai. She was supposed to buy
your shorty Tyco with your money,
then she went to the doctor to get
lypo with your money.
AARON
What are you talking about?
LEBRON JAMES
It’s Kanye.
AARON
You’re quoting Kanye West to me?
You know what, Amy’s not like that.
At all. This is gonna be great. I
think she’s cool and I don’t have
to worry about that.
Aaron shoots and scores on LeBron
AARON (CONT’D)
Did you let me do that? Did I just
score on you? Yes. You are my bitch
Lebron James.
LeBron takes a step toward Aaron.
AARON (CONT’D)
But not really. You gotta admit
that was a good shot. I scored on
Lebron James, I’m never playing
basketball again. Lunch is on you
buddy.

74.
Aaron leaves the gym. He walks back in and throws up chalk,
like Lebron.
Damnit.

LEBRON JAMES

EXT. ASSISTED LIVING - GAZEBO - DAY
Gordon and Amy are sitting in a gazebo. Gordon reaches to zip
his sweatshirt. He is in pain and can’t.
GORDON
How’s work?
AMY
Work’s great actually. I think I’m
going to get that editor spot.
Aaron’s been pushing me to think
bigger. Can I just do this?
Amy zips it for him.
AMY (CONT’D)
Aaron was telling me about this
acupuncturist. He said she’s helped
a lot of his patients with pain
management. He wants her to take a
look at you, would you do that?
GORDON
I have no desire for some Oriental
woman to touch me above the waist.
AMY
Don't say that. That’s disgusting.
Say Asian.
GORDON
Why does Aaron all of a sudden know
everything about everything?
AMY
He is a doctor. He knows something.
GORDON
He’s a sports doctor, he’s not a
real doctor, let’s face it. A real
doctor tries to cure diseases, he’s
trying to get courtside seats to
the playoffs.

75.
AMY
You’re saying sports doctors aren’t
real doctors?
GORDON
Yeah. When they say what do you
want to focus on, I want to focus
on MS, cancer, what about you? I
want to focus on whatever gets me
closest to men’s locker rooms. I
want giant, athletic penises close
to my face, while I’m pretending to
look at their knees.
AMY
He’s a good doctor and does a lot
with Doctors Without Borders.
GORDON
I'm not saying he’s not a good guy,
but he’s got about a month left
before you give him the boot,
right?
AMY
What does that mean?
GORDON
He’s a reaction from the muscle
bound knucklehead so now you go for
the nerdy brainiac, I know how your
pattern works. It’s my pattern.
AMY
I really like him. I want you to be
nice to him and take it seriously.
Will you do that? I think we have a
real shot.
GORDON
You sound like a Lifetime movie.
One of the happy ones, not the
murder ones.
AMY
Don’t you want me to be happy?
GORDON
You’re building him up and you’re
gonna let yourself up for a big
fall. He’s gonna break your heart.

76.
AMY
I’m leaving. I’ll talk to you
later. I’ll tell Temembe to come
get you.
Amy exits.
GORDON
Amy. Don’t leave like this. I don’t
like it when you don’t talk to me
for a while.
EXT. OUTSIDE KIM’S HOUSE - DAY
Amy and Aaron walk toward a suburban house. They are dressed
nicely.
AMY
Thanks for doing this with me.

I’m Kim, so nice to meet you.
AARON
Nice to meet you. You’re Tom.
TOM
Hey man, how are you? Hey Amy.
AMY
Hey. Congrats on trapping my sister
with your seed.
TOM
Not all sex ends with a flush and a
cry.

77.
AMY
That’s killer.
EXT. KIM’S BACKYARD - DAY
The MEN stand outside around the grill.
AARON
I haven’t been to a baby shower in
years.
TOM
So glad you made it.
AARON
Congratulations man.
KEVIN
I hear you work with athletes?
They all try and hide the fact that they are freaking out.
They all start almost circling Aaron.
AARON
Yes. I’m a physician and a surgeon.
I mostly work with the Knicks right
now. And other athletes.
KYLE
Really? Which ones?
TIM
Specifically which athletes?
Tom Brady.

AARON

TIM
Any other athletes that you work
with?
AARON
Jay Cutler.
Whoa.

KEVIN/TOM/TIM/KYLE

AARON
Do you guys follow tennis? Roger
Federer.
Whoa.

TIM

78.
Tim and Tom high five.
AARON
Robert Griffin, Chris Paul, CP3.
The guys are all thrilled.
AARON (CONT’D)
Alex Rodriguez.
TIM
Fuck that guy!
Silence.
AARON
Clayton Kershaw.
The guys are all excited again.
Whoa.

KEVIN/TOM/TIM/KYLE

INT. KIM’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
WENDY
He’s great Amy.
LISA
Yeah, where’d you find him?
AMY
Through work.
LISA
You two are cute together.
WENDY
You would have the most perfect
babies.
KAT
I could just eat you up.
AMY
Yeah, it seems a little early for
this kind of talk.
LISA
It’s not. My life did not begin
until I had kids. You’re life has
not begun.

79.
AMY
You know I’m pretty happy right
now.
LISA
Aaron do you want a family?
AARON
Yeah. I think I’d like to have two
by the time I’m forty.
TIM
Two is tight.
WENDY
If I were you, I would start having
them as soon as possible.
INT. KIM AND TOM’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
Kim walks Amy into the dining room. Pours her a drink.
AMY
He wants to have two kids like
right now.
KIM
Amy! People talk about that.
AMY
Not really. I don’t know anyone
that talks about that.
KIM
He’s great. I really like him.
AMY
Can you tell the members of
Heaven’s Gate in there to relax?
He’s too nice.
KIM
He’s not too nice.
AMY
Yes he is. He’s too nice for me,
You know it.
KIM
He’s the perfect amount of nice you
deserve.

80.
AMY
There’s dealbreakers with him
across the board. The sex is good.
Really good. Like great. But it’s
not the best I’ve ever had.
KIM
You don’t want best sex you’ve ever
had guy.
AMY
No, no you want to stay with the
best you’ve ever had guy.
KIM
No you don’t. That’s a creepy guy.
Best sex you’ve ever had guy is in
jail.
AMY
Yeah, but I’ve been thinking about
maybe reaching out to him.
KIM
Stop it. Breathe. It’s fine, he’s
great.
Amy thinks about this. Allister walks up to Kim.
ALLISTER
Mother, if I kiss the belly hard
enough, will the baby feel it?
KIM
You wanna try?
Allister kisses her belly.
KIM (CONT’D)
I think the baby did feel it.
Allister is happy, walks away.
No.

AMY

INT. KIM’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Aaron and Tom are in the living room talking. Kevin stands
there listening uncomfortably.
AARON
Kim’s great, man.

81.
TOM
Amy’s great too by the way. But
keep her away from those pro
athletes.
Tom laughs. Aaron doesn’t.
AARON
What does that mean?
TOM
Oh, no. That was a joke. Like that
she would sleep with them.
AARON
I don’t get the joke.
TOM
Those are the kinds of jokes she
tells. Like I’m loose. I’m a whore.
AARON
That’s my girlfriend.
TOM
It’s not my joke. Those are the
kind of joke she tells which I’m
not for at all. I’m always like
don’t tell these kinds of jokes.
And then she does. Forget I said
anything. Just drag that one to the
trash and empty trash.
INT. KIM AND TOM’S HOUSE - SIDE ROOM
WENDY
Okay, so the game is skeletons in
the closet. We all have to admit
something we’ve never told anyone
before. I’ll start. Sometimes after
Kyle falls asleep, I get up and eat
Skinny Cow ice cream pops.
Sometimes a box of them. That
doesn’t leave this room.
LISA
Wendy! You should be asleep!
KIM
That’s a whole regular size ice
cream if you eat the whole box.

82.
WENDY
I know, I know! Your turn.
LISA
Last week I let my six year old
watch Glee.
Too soon!

KAT

KIM
That show is very racy.
LISA
There were some homosexual
undertones, I will say that. There
were two girls kissing in this
episode. And I haven’t even
explained to them what gay people
are.
AMY
Uh, they’re people.
WENDY
Amy, your turn.
AMY
Ok, hard act to follow. Thanks for
being brave and sharing that.
Thanks for trusting. OK. One time I
had sex with a guy I had just met.
And afterwards we couldn’t find the
condom anywhere.
The women are a bit confused.
AMY (CONT’D)
So a couple days later, I started
wondering where the condom was and
I looked online and found out that
a lot of times they get trapped
inside, like up by your cervix. It
said if that happens you need to
get it out. It says just “bear
down” (Air quotes) and fish it out.
So I sat on the toilet and sure
enough it was up there. So I made
my finger like a hook (makes finger
like a hook) and got it out. I
beared down.
The women are stunned.

83.
KAT
I let Tim and his brothers tag team
me on Christmas morning. And you
know what? It was wonderful.
AMY
I like her.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy works at her desk. Her phone rings.
Hi.

AMY

KIM
Hi. Can you come over?
AMY
No, I’m working. Is this about the
baby shower because I’m sorry I
wasn’t nicer to the Real Housewives
of Hell.
KIM
No it’s fine. It’s not about that.
What’s up?

AMY

KIM (V.O.)
Dad died. He was hoarding
medication and his heart gave out.
Amy? Are you there?
EXT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Noam panhandles.
NOAM
Little change. A penny, a nickel, a
ruble. Crowd-fund this.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Aaron is on the phone and making tea. Amy is a mess laying on
the couch. He hands her the tea.

84.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
Amy walks uphill towards the grave site.
Dianna sits with Nikki, Schultz and Bryson. Nikki leans over
to Temembe.
NIKKI
I had a black boyfriend once.
TEMEMBE
You’re mother must be proud.
NIKKI
And I’d do it again.
Amy walks to the front and pulls out a paper.
AMY
Hello. Thank you for coming. Gordon
David Townsend. Not that great of a
guy. He was kind of racist and
homophobic. He was a drunk. He was
a drunk. He once apologized to me
for missing my volleyball game.
That he was at. He had made signs
with my name on them. When I was 11
this kid Brandon Lipinsky stole my
bike. Maybe he was just borrowing
it. But our dad went to his house
and beat up his dad, and his
grandpa, and Brandon. I’ll bet he
personally offended everyone here.
Raise your hand if our dad ever
offended you.
Most people raise their hands.
AMY (CONT’D)
Yeah, he was an asshole. When I
asked him to tell me the story of
how he proposed to our mom, his
response was, who? I know he was
joking. He loved her a lot. He was
really sick for a really long time,
which isn’t fair because I don’t
think anyone else was more alive
than him when he was younger. He
thought it was payback. He thought
it was karma and that’s why he got
sick. But I don’t think so. I think
he was the greatest Dad. He always
made me feel loved and important. I
know he fucked up.
(MORE)

85.
AMY (CONT’D)
I know he probably hurt everyone
here, but raise your hand if he was
one of your favorite people.
Most hands go up.
AMY (CONT’D)
He was my favorite person. Thank
you.
Dianna is moved. She whispers to Nikki.
DIANNA
This makes me wish they had found
my father’s remains.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER
Aaron and Amy walk over to Kim, Tom and Allister.
Hey.

AMY

Amy and Kim hug.
ALLISTER
Mother, can we go to La Poubelle
now?
KIM
Sure honey.
AMY
How about a piece of pizza? So mom
doesn’t have to take you to a
French restaurant.
ALLISTER
Pizza has gluten in it.
AMY
Who gives a shit? I'm sorry.
TOM
I’ll just put Allister in the car.
Allister and Tom walk away.
AMY
Can we have one second?
Aaron walks away.

86.
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m joking.
KIM
I’m not in the mood today. I’m not
in the mood for jokes today.
AMY
I thought you’d be in a great mood.
You don’t have to pay for dad’s
nursing home anymore.
KIM
What are you doing? Don’t push me
away.
AMY
I’m pushing you away? You’ve been
running away from this fucking
family forever.
KIM
Amy, I am not a crazy person
because I got married and got
pregnant with a child. That’s what
people do.
AMY
Why are you even here? You didn’t
even like him. I did everything for
him. You don’t get to pretend today
like you gave a fuck.
Tom comes over and takes Kim’s hand. Looks Amy in the eye.
TOM
That’s enough for today, Amy.
Tom and Kim walk away. Aaron walks over.
AARON
You okay? You ready to go?
Yeah.

AMY

AARON
I just want you to know I really
care about you.
Thank you.

AMY

87.
AARON
And I love you.
AMY
What? Are you seriously saying that
to me today? They’re literally
putting dirt onto my father’s body.
Today’s the day you say that. Let’s
go.
They walk away together.
AARON
Was that bad?
AMY
Yes that’s bad. Bad timing.
(points to parked town
cars)
Is this us? Is this us? Can he pull
up, do we have his number?
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy is putting the Mets stuff out and lining up Gordon’s snow
globes like a shrine. She shakes one.
INT. AARON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy sits up awake in bed.
INT. S’NUFF MAGAZINE - DAY
Amy is sitting at her desk. Dianna approaches.
Hey.

AMY

DIANNA
How’s it going, sweetheart?
AMY
I’m getting by. Thank you for
coming. That was really nice. I
can’t believe he’s gone. I am
literally just sitting here
expecting him to call. It feels
like a dream.

88.
DIANNA
Are we still talking about this?
That was eight days ago. I’m over
it. It was hard, but I’m over it.
Best way to grieve, don’t do it.
I’ve got good news for you. You
know that story, Mr. Dr. Boring
Sports Guy. I cut it. I know you
weren’t in love with that piece
anyway.
AMY
No. I’m very in love with that
piece.
DIANNA
There’s nothing happening, there’s
just no tension there. No sex
appeal. He’s a bore. Did you see
the pictures? We did a photo shoot
with him. Look at him.
Shows a photo of Aaron looking stiff.
DIANNA (CONT’D)
Personally I don’t like his odd,
bird face. We tried everything. We
tried a ball. Supposed to be a
sports guy I don’t think he’s ever
touched a ball before. Not that
kind anyway. There he is standing
stiff as a scarecrow. We even got
him wet. I mean would you fuck
that?
Sure.

AMY

DIANNA
You would? I wouldn’t fuck that
with your dick. We’re going with
Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under Six.
Let’s get this done Amy or we are
not talking promotion. Good girl.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy puts on makeup quickly. Stops and stares at herself.
Aaron talks to her through the door. He’s wearing a nice
suit.
AARON
You almost ready?

89.
AMY
I need like two seconds. How you
feeling about Amar’e’s surgery
tomorrow?
AARON
I don’t feel any pressure at all.
If it doesn’t work it’s just the
end of his career. But I feel fine.
(he is looking at her
outfit)
You look great. Is that a formal
dress?
AMY
There’s flowers on it, and it’s
shiny kind of. Is it too short?
AARON
These people are real conservative.
It’s more gown.
AMY
Oh yeah, do you just want me to go
into my gown closet? Will you grab
my tiara, it’s right next to my
pearls?
AARON
Forget I said anything. You look
beautiful. You’re crazy hot, let’s
go.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
Amy and Aaron walk into a grand ballroom. Lots of rich older
people. A sign reads “Doctors Without Borders.”
AARON
You look beautiful.
AMY
I look like a dickhead. Why didn’t
you tell me this was so fancy?
AARON
What? No. Come on.
GUESTS congratulate Aaron.

90.
WOMAN
Dr. Conners, welcome. Do you mind
if I grab you for just a minute to
go over something?
AARON
Sure, sure.
(to Amy)
I’ll be right back.
AMY
Ok. I’m fine.
Aaron leaves Amy alone.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER
Aaron chats with others at the table, including AMAR’E
STOUDEMIRE. WAITER comes by with wine.
WAITER
Would you like some more wine?
AMY
That’d be great.
AARON
It’s a luncheon.
AMY
It’s wine. (To the waiter) I’ll
have some more.
TONY ROMO steps up to the podium. The band stops playing.
People settle in.
TONY ROMO
Thank you. I’m Tony Romo. (holds
for applause)
Soccer?
Football.

AMY
AARON

TONY ROMO
I’ll tell you what, I don’t get
cheered in New York very often.
This is a rare treat for me this
evening.

91.
AMAR’E
Dallas sucks.
TONY ROMO
That’s Amar’e Stoudemire for those
of you who don’t know. He’s been
following me around all week.
Anyway we’re here today to talk
about our esteemed recipient. No
athlete wants to go under the
knife. But when you do, you feel
comfortable with Dr. Conners. He’s
not just changing professional
athletes and the way they look at
medicine. He’s changing the world
and he’s helping everybody. From
pandemics to war torn regions to
extreme poverty situations, they
feel safe in his hands. To our MVP
and to my good friend, Dr. Aaron
Conners.
Everyone applauds. Aaron kisses Amy.
Good luck.

AMY

Aaron walks up to the podium and accepts the award.
AARON
Wow, look at this. Very nice of you
guys. Very sharp. Be doing the
surgery tomorrow with this, Amar’e.
And don’t eat anything after
midnight tonight.
AMAR’E
I’m hungry!
Big laugh from the crowd. Amar’e smiles.
AARON
But I really want to thank the
actual heroes from Doctors Without
Borders.
Amy gets a text message from Dianna: “Avoiding me? Pick up or
you’re fired!” Her phone starts ringing.
Hello.

AMY

92.
DIANNA (V.O.)
Amy it’s Dianna, we really need to
talk.
AMY
Actually it’s a really bad time. Is
there any chance I could-DIANNA (V.O.)
No, I don’t wanna hear that it’s a
bad time.
AMY
Yeah but maybe in like an hour.
DIANNA (V.O.)
You could be replaced within the
hour by ninety other girls who
graduated from better places than
whatever state school you blew your
way through.
AMY
I’m stepping out.
DIANNA (V.O.)
Thank you very much. For fuck’s
sake.
Amy walks out of the room. Aaron notices that Amy’s seat is
empty. He presses on.
AARON
This organization came into my life
at a time when I was truly looking
to make a difference.
INT. SIDEROOM - DAY
AMY
I’m listening.
DIANNA (V.O.)
Which of these can we live without,
“We Forgive you Lance Armstrong,”
“The Inventor of the Pussy Magnet,”
and “Are You Gay or Is She Just
Boring?”

93.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
AARON
This organization is a family, and
it’s a family I’m very happy to be
a part of. Thank you.
The audience claps. Aaron looks at Amy’s empty seat.
INT. SIDEROOM - DAY
Amy lights her one-hitter. Aaron walks up, still holding his
award. Amy waves away the smoke.
Hey.

AARON

AMY
I was just coming in to watch you.
AARON
You missed it.
AMY
Shit, I got a phone call. How’d it
go?
AARON
I know you are going through a lot
right now, but I really needed you
in there. And you’re out here
smoking weed.
AMY
No, I didn’t come out here to smoke
pot. I came out here because Dianna
called.
AARON
I really needed you in there. You
were my lifeline. You knew that.
AMY
I really can’t take you seriously
when you’re holding that. Why’d you
bring your award out here? You
don’t have to carry it around like
Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party,
can you just put it down?
AARON
That’s crazy Amy. You knew I wanted
to do that speech to you.

94.
AMY
I really didn’t want to miss it,
I’m just afraid I’m going to lose
my job right now.
AARON
It doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t
have your phone on in the middle of
my speech anyway. It’s so
disrespectful.
AMY
Alright goodbye.
AARON
What’re you talking about goodbye?
AMY
What, I’m leaving. We’re fighting,
we won’t talk for a while. That’s
how this works.
AARON
What are you talking about? No,
we’re just having a fight.
AMY
What are we doing? What do you
want? Why are you with me?
AARON
I love you.
AMY
Why do you keep saying that?
AARON
Because I mean it. I love you. I’m
crazy about you. We're just having
a fight. You insulted me. We’re
talking about it and we’ll work
through it.
AMY
What’s wrong with you that you want
to be with me? I’m a drinker.
AARON
I don’t care.
AMY
I’ve been with a lot of guys.

95.
AARON
I don’t care. How many?
AMY
I don’t know. How many girls have
you slept with?
AARON
I’ve slept with three women.
AMY
Me too. I have slept with three
women too.
AARON
How many guys?
This year?
This year?

AMY
AARON

AMY
Fuck this, I’m not talking about
this.
AARON
Amy, come on don’t say fuck this.
Amy walks away.
AMY
Don’t follow me.
Amy.

AARON

INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy brushes her teeth.
AMY
I’m tired. I want to go to bed.
AARON
No. We cannot go to bed angry
that’s my only rule. My parents
lived by that rule.
AMY
Your parents weren’t that happy.

96.
AARON
They’re very happy.
AMY
OK, let’s really get into it. Let’s
talk about every issue we’ve ever
encountered. I’ll start. You go
down on me too much.
What?

AARON

AMY
It’s selfish. You act like it’s for
me, but really it’s to show how
great you are, like you’re always
helping people.
AARON
I shouldn’t go down on you as much?
AMY
Don't try and spin this as a way to
not go down on me as much. That’s
ridiculous. Of course I want you to
go down on me that much.
AARON
So take it down a notch?
AMY
No keep going down on me. Forget
this whole part of the argument,
ok? Forget that.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT, LATER
Amy and Aaron are making out on the couch.
AARON
I’m so glad you apologized.
AMY
I didn’t apologize. Wow, I did not
apologize. Are you serious?
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT, LATER
Amy’s pacing. Aaron struggles to stay awake.

97.
AMY
I’ve been through a lot this year,
and of course I’m going to have
some ups and downs, but that’s why
I need stop and say am I going to
follow the river or am I going to
make decisions in my life? You’re
sleeping. You were just asleep.
AARON
No I wasn’t.
AMY
Ok, good, because I am not close to
done. I have a lot of thoughts and
I’m very comfortable right now
talking to you like this.
Aaron falls asleep with his eyes open. Sound goes out.
AMY (CONT’D)
Wake up Aaron! You’re totally
sleeping.
Nhnh.

AARON

AMY
You said we were gonna stay up till
we figure it out like your parents.
AARON
I’m listening.
AMY
What’d I just say?
AARON
You said wake up.
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY
Aaron is walking into the building looking like a zombie.
INT. PRE-OP ROOM - DAY
Aaron enters.
Amar’e.

AARON

98.

Hey Doc.

AMAR’E

AARON
How you feeling today? You ready to
do this?
Yeah.

AMAR’E

AARON
We’re gonna do this. It’s gonna be
great. You’ve met Rachel.
NURSE RACHEL walks in. Reads his chart.
NURSE RACHEL
Yes. We’ve been acquainted.
Rachel is switching the IV bag on the rack and in his arm.
AMAR’E
What’s that?
NURSE RACHEL
Just a little more sedative. To
relax you.
AARON
The good stuff.
Whoah.

AMAR’E

AARON
Alright buddy. Ok we’re going to
replace your cruciate ligament. Do
you want a coffee?
AMAR’E
I’m not supposed to drink before.
AARON
Don’t worry about it. Just one
coffee.
AMAR’E
Are you ok, Doc?
AARON
I’m great. Me and Amy got in a
little argument, but I think I’m
doing ok.
(MORE)

99.
AARON (CONT'D)
This is gonna go really well. She
really lit into me last night.
Wow.

AMAR’E

AARON
Like a side of her I’ve never seen
before. It got dark, fast.
AMAR’E
Are you sure you’re ok?
AARON
I’m good. We’re gonna get this
going.
Perfect.

AMAR’E

Aaron opens a Sharpie with his teeth.
AARON
I’m gonna mark the knee that we’re
gonna do the surgery on.
AMAR’E
That’s the wrong knee.
AARON
I’m marking this as not the knee to
do. Not the knee.
AMAR’E
Are you sure you’re ok?
AARON
Amar’e I’m great. This is gonna go
great. This is the bad boy we’re
going to split open.
AMAR’E
This is a bad idea.
AARON
You’re nervous, everyone gets
nervous.
AMAR’E
I don’t think you get it. We need
to reschedule this.

100.
AARON
No, we’re not doing that. I’ve got
to get you back out on the court.
We’ve got to get you back on the
court. I wanna see you play. I’m
here for you. You’re nervous, I’m
nervous. Amy was acting like a
psycho last night. I don’t know
what I did. I really like her, but
she’s like a fucking demon. Like
the fucking excorcist. I said I
have surgery, you gotta let me
sleep, and you know what she said?
(Exorcist voice)
No.
AMAR’E
I’m taking a rain check.
Amar’e pulls out the IV. A spurt of blood splashes Aaron’s
face.
Amar’e tries to stand up. Rachel catches him from behind and
her arms are wrapped around him. She is holding him up.
NURSE RACHEL
Mr. Stoudemire, where are you
going?
AMAR’E
I gotta get out of here.
NURSE RACHEL
Amar’e. Watch your head.
Amar’e crashes to the ground.
Oh shit.

AARON

INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy is still asleep on the couch. Aaron enters. Amy acts
totally normal.
AMY
(sweetly)
Hey. How did it go?
Aaron looks at her like she is insane.

101.
AARON
It could have gone better. Have you
just been smoking pot and watching
TV all day?
AMY
No, I got up and had some cereal at
some point.
AARON
They canceled my surgery today.
Amar’e didn’t feel comfortable with
me performing it because I was too
tired. So he fled. He was on a lot
of anesthesia and he fell. When I
tried to help him he called me a
witch.
Is he ok?

AMY

AARON
It was because of all this shit
last night. Which was crazy. I was
thinking about it on the way over
here. Can I say something? It does
bother me that you smoke pot and
drink a lot and I do care that you
slept with a lot of guys. It makes
me feel unsafe.
AMY
Yeah. You should be with a girl who
you feel safe with.
AARON
That’s not what I’m saying.
AMY
It’s very clear. Obvious. You
should be with one of those
cheerleaders.
Amy.

AARON

AMY
Go be with that kind of girl.
Little Texan with huge hair and big
tits. But when you get married she
wants to be more conservative so
she gets smaller fake tits. But
they still look amazing.

102.
AARON
You know the thing about
cheerleaders is they bring people
together and make them happy.
Unlike you and your friends at your
magazine who sit there and judge
people from afar, because if you
don’t try then you can’t fail.
That’s why you’re threatened by
cheerleaders.
AMY
That’s me. You really got me.
AARON
You know what, Amy, I have to do
the surgery in two days. Let’s take
those two days off and then I’ll
come back and we’ll work this out.
AMY
I think you’re right, that’s good.
I know we’re done here.
Done?

AARON

AMY
It’s fine. It’s fine that we’re
done, because I don’t need to talk
to you anymore. Because the
interview is over. Because your
article got canceled. My boss said
you were too boring.
You win.

AARON

Aaron walks to the door. He stops then leaves.
Amy starts to cry, then composes herself.
INT. DRUIDS - NIGHT
Amy dances with Schultz, Bryson and Donald.
INT. DRUIDS - LATER
Amy and Donald sit in a booth with drinks. Amy is way more
trashed than Donald.

103.
DONALD
How’re you doing?
So great.
Fun right?

AMY
DONALD

AMY
This is the best, I love this.
So are you gonna work at the
magazine after the internship?
Honestly?
Yeah.

DONALD
AMY

DONALD
Probably not.
AMY
Why you’re so good, and you have
such good energy.
DONALD
But being around all these
pictures, I kind of want to do
photography.
AMY
Oh yeah I can see that for you.
Like pictures and I love that
stuff.
BARTENDER
Last call for alcohol. Last call.
AMY
I’ve got to get out of here.
DONALD
Oh you want to get outta here?
Amy is surprised. Shrugs, then takes a shot.
AMY
Yeah, ok. Let’s go.

104.
INT. CARLYLE SUITE APARTMENT - NIGHT
Large echoey, rich old money shit. Donald is sober but Amy is
still trashed, looks around.
AMY
Shit Donald.
They kiss. He pushes her on the bed.
DONALD
It’s so nice to hang with you
outside the office.
AMY
This is great. I really like you.
They kiss. He tries to lick her.
AMY (CONT’D)
Ok, maybe let’s, next phase, next
phase it up.
DONALD
I know just what you mean.
He leaps on top of her.
AMY
Ooh, when did you get here?
He takes off his jacket.
AMY (CONT’D)
Let’s get that going.
He rips off his shirt.
DONALD
Shit. Shit.
AMY
Yeah. Shit.
DONALD
Feel me. Grab my tits.
AMY
I feel like I’m the one with the
tits in the equation but this is
cool.
DONALD
You wanna lick ‘em? Yes you do.

105.
He grabs her and pushes her mouth into his nipple.
You there?

DONALD (CONT’D)

AMY
Yeah I’m right there.
DONALD
Suckle it. Aw shit.
AMY
I don’t have a good angle.
She lays back down.
DONALD
Stay really still.
He pours a line of white powder on her forehead.
AMY
What is that?
DONALD
It’s Adderall. I have ADHD and it
helps me with my education.
He snorts it and moans.
AMY
This is so great, but-DONALD
Cradle my botch.
What?

AMY

DONALD
Cradle my botch.
AMY
I’m gonna take a rain check.
DONALD
You wanna get on top. You wanna
take charge, daddy?
Yeah.

AMY

They switch positions.

106.
AMY (CONT’D)
It’s momma’s turn.
DONALD
I just want you to know, my safe
word is pineapple.
AMY
Alright, got it.
Hit me.
Hit you?

DONALD
AMY

DONALD
Yeah. I want you to hit me.
Ok.

AMY

Amy slaps him softly in the chest.
DONALD
Are you serious? In the face.
Amy slaps him softly in the face.
Hit me.

DONALD (CONT’D)

AMY
I’m hitting you.
DONALD
Hit me hard.
She slaps him again.
DONALD (CONT’D)
Oh fucking do it already?
AMY
I’m hitting you.
She slaps him again harder.
DONALD
What don’t you take a little
arthritis medication and try again?
She hits him again.

107.
DONALD (CONT’D)
You pathetic, childless MILF, hit
me like this.
Donald slaps her hard.
Owww.

AMY

Amy clocks him.
DONALD
Owwww. Fuck. Pineapple. Pineapple.
Shit.

AMY

Donald weeps. TAWNY walks in the door. She is Amy’s age.
TAWNY
What’s going on in here? Donnie?
Mommy.
Mommy?

DONALD
AMY

DONALD
Mommy. My eye!
TAWNY
He’s sixteen years old!
FUCK!

DIANNA
Amy, we’ve all been there. Oh yeah.
I once fucked three quarters of
Pink Floyd. Yeah. Dark side of all
their moons.
(MORE)

108.
DIANNA (CONT'D)
Amy, you are such a strong writer.
I would say you are my most
valuable writer.
Thank you.

AMY

DIANNA
I reread through your latest draft
of the Dr. Conners piece. I have to
confess I spoke too soon. It is
very good.
Really?

AMY

DIANNA
It really is. It’s very good.
AMY
Thank you. You won’t regret this
Dianna. I know you said, don’t-DIANNA
Regret what? I’m not publishing it
here. God, no. You’re fired. Amy,
you’re so fired. How could you not
get that? I can’t have one of my
employees having sex with someone
underage AND beating them up. One
or the other, but not the combo.
See what I’m saying?
Schultz and Bryson enter.
SCHULTZ
Hey Dianna, we just...
BRYSON
Oh, you’re doing it now? Sorry.
Should we just come back, or did it
already happen?
AMY
Everyone knows?
SCHULTZ
Did what already happen?
BRYSON
Amy fucked Donald.
AMY
I didn’t fuck Donald. I tried..

109.

You tried?

SCHULTZ

BRYSON
He’s sixteen.
Oh my God.

SCHULTZ

DIANNA
Get out you guys.
BRYSON
His safe word is pineapple.
AMY
Fuck you Schultz. Should we line up
the winners you’ve fucked. The girl
who was quarantined for we don’t
even know what?
Schultz and Bryson leave.
DIANNA
I’m so sorry about that. So
inappropriate. Anyway, nice news, I
know you’re close with Nikki, she
got the executive editor position.
AMY
That’s great.
Nikki appears in the doorway.
NIKKI
Thanks Amy, that means the world.
Although, I could turn down the
position if you want me to.
AMY
Ok, yeah. Please don’t take it. I’m
serious.
Nikki looks devastated.
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m kidding.
NIKKI
You’re funny.
AMY
Congratulations.

110.
NIKKI
You scared me!
Nikki leaves.
AMY
She’s great.
DIANNA
She looks like an idiot.
Amy waits for Dianna to say “but...”
Ok, go.

DIANNA (CONT’D)

INT. SNACKEY’S - NIGHT
Aaron eats alone. Everyone else is having a nice time.
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
Amy writes alone.
EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY
Aaron watching a GIRL smoke pot. He looks sad.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING - DAY
Amy visits with Norman. He talks, she listens.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAILBOAT POND - DAY
Amy revisits the pond alone.
INT. POST-OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Amar’e is waking up. He is still heavily sedated.
AARON
Amar’e. Hey buddy.
AMAR’E
Hey, Doc. How’d we do?
AARON
You did great.

111.
AMAR’E
Did it go Tom Brady good?
AARON
It went better than Brady good.
AMAR’E
Have you seen his wife Giselle?
AARON
Yeah I have.
She’s hot.

AMAR’E

AARON
You’re on a lot of medication. Why
don’t you get some sleep?
AMAR’E
Isn’t she like a Victoria Secret
model?
AARON
I don’t know. I think so. I’m gonna
be right here. I’m gonna be on this
floor so if you need anything you
let me know, ok?
AMAR’E
I follow her on instagram.
AARON
Ok. You should go to sleep buddy.
Amar’e hugs Aaron.
AMAR’E
I love you.
AARON
Ok. And he’s asleep.
INT. AARON’S APARTMENT - EVENING
Aaron sleeps on his couch. He is a mess. Stubble, pajamas,
one sock on. He’s watching The Dogwalker.
MARISA TOMEI
Everybody’s left a dog in a hot car
at some point in there lives.

112.
DANIEL RADCLIFFE
I don’t think that’s true.
The phone rings and Aaron answers.
AARON

Hello?

LEBRON JAMES (V.O.)
Aaron? It’s Lebron. I’m at the gym.
I think I pulled something. I need
you to come down. It hurts like a
mother.
AARON
I’ll be right over.
Hurry up.
Sit tight.

LEBRON JAMES (V.O.)
AARON

INT./EXT. CULTURE FITNESS - NIGHT
Aaron runs in.
Lebron?

AARON
You ok?

We see CHRIS EVERT and MATTHEW BRODERICK sitting on each side
of LeBron. They are all drinking from red cups.
LEBRON JAMES
I’m not ok Aaron. I’m concerned
about you.
AARON
You’re not hurt?
LEBRON JAMES
This is your intervention.
AARON
My intervention? For what?
LEBRON JAMES
You ruined things with Amy.
AARON
This is about Amy?

113.
LEBRON JAMES
You’ve been so sad lately.
MATTHEW BRODERICK
Aaron, we’re concerned about you.
You’ve helped us, now we’re going
to help you.
AARON
Come on man.
MATTHEW BRODERICK
Sit. Sit down.
Aaron sits down. MARV ALBERT appears.
MARV ALBERT
Oh it started and it is on. I’m
sorry I’m late. Did I miss
anything?
MATTHEW BRODERICK
I know relationships can be
terrifying, but you don't bail out
at the first sign of trouble.
MARV ALBERT
It’s obvious, Aaron choking under
intense pressure.
AARON
I did not choke, Marv.
CHRIS EVERT
Look, if he’s not happy, and she’s
not the right one for him then
obviously it’s not meant to be.
Sometimes the right person is
sitting right in front of you.
MARV ALBERT
Chris Evert hitting on Aaron hard.
LEBRON JAMES
Chris, don’t hit on Aaron.
CHRIS EVERT
Lebron, don’t be a cockblocker.
MARV ALBERT
Evert is still at it and frankly
it’s making me uncomfortable.

114.
MATTHEW BRODERICK
You know what I think the issue
might be, you’re probably focusing
on her problems instead of looking
in the mirror.
MARV ALBERT
Aaron is playing the blame game.
AARON
Thank you, Marv.
MATTHEW BRODERICK
I bet you’re not the easiest person
to have a relationship with.
MARV ALBERT
Broderick, cutting deep with his
insights. He is on fire. His best
work since War Games.
AARON
You guys don’t understand, I tried.
She didn’t want to be a part of it.
LEBRON JAMES
You can’t just run when you get
scared.
AARON
She pushed me away.
MARV ALBERT
Aaron is fearing engulfment and
intimacy.
AARON
You know what, you’re not helpful.
You’re not helpful, you’re not
helpful. And you are really not
helpful Marv. Really not helpful.
MARV ALBERT
Marv Albert apologizes.
Bye.
Aaron.

AARON
LEBRON JAMES

AARON
Goodbye, LeBron.

115.
Aaron walks off.
MATTHEW BRODERICK
I thought you said he would look at
my hip.
LEBRON JAMES
Yeah, if things would’ve went
better.
EXT. KIM’S HOUSE - DAY
Amy knocks at the door. Kim opens it.
INT. KIM’S SUNROOM - DAY
Amy and Kim sit on Kim’s couch.
KIM
This isn’t working for you anymore.
AMY
I know. I’m sorry.
KIM
I know you’re sorry.
AMY
No, I’m really sorry. I want you to
know that I act like everything you
do in your life is so wrong and
stupid because I don’t think I can
have that. I’m not ok. I’m not ok
Kimmie. I know what I am. I know
who I am and I’m broken.
Allister walks up holding a notebook.
ALLISTER
Mother, Dad needs you.
KIM
We’re talking right now, what’s
going on?
ALLISTER
I don’t know he’s just yelling.
OK.

KIM

Kim goes inside leaving Amy and Allister alone.

116.
AMY
What’s this?
ALLISTER
My drawings. For Minecraft.
For what?

AMY

ALLISTER
Minecraft. It’s a game where you
can build a whole virtual world and
put whatever you want in it. And
make it big or small or whatever.
AMY
Let me see. If it’s a video game,
why’s it in a notebook?
ALLISTER
I draw it out first to plan it so I
know what to build and what to put
in it instead of just winging it.
AMY
What’s this?
ALLISTER
This is our house. Here’s my
bedroom. And here’s the baby’s
room.
AMY
What’s this rectangle?
ALLISTER
It’s the mattress for you and Aaron
to stay in once the baby is born.
AMY
That’s for me?
ALLISTER
You and Aaron, yeah.
AMY
That’s really cool Allister.
Thank you.

ALLISTER

AMY
But I don’t think Aaron will be
around much anymore.

117.
ALLISTER
You don’t like him anymore?
AMY
I like him more than anybody. He’s
my best friend.
ALLISTER
Then we should have him come over.
AMY
Yeah, we should.
Amy notices Kim in the door. Tom puts his arm around Kim who
is in the doorway bawling.
AMY (CONT’D)
The baby’s room is pink? It’s a
girl.
Kim nods.
ALLISTER
It’s a girl.
AMY
That’s amazing. Congrats. That’s
the best.
KIM
No it’s not.
AMY
No it’s not, it’s the worst thing
in the world.
KIM
She’s doomed.
AMY
No, she’s not. She’ll be fine.
She’s got us. She’ll be fine.
KIM
I miss dad too.
AMY
I know that. Come here.
Amy and Kim hug. Tom and Allister join.
AMY (CONT’D)
I am uncomfortable.

118.
TOM
Take the love.
AMY
Too much intimacy. Love overload.
I’m exiting this hug.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy is gathering up her bottles of booze and all the pot
hidden around her apartment.
EXT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy gives her bottles and drugs to Noam.
Hey Noam.

AMY

NOAM
What’s up, Amy?
A gift.

AMY

NOAM
Booze, pot, drugs and a place to
live. Amy you’re the best. I’ve got
to give you something. How about a
reach around?
AMY
Oh, I don’t need a reach around.
Thanks man.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Amy sits and reads aloud.
AMY
The most important play of the
season is about to take place. And
there isn’t a scoreboard, fan or
cheerleader in sight.
EXT. VANITY FAIR OFFICES - DAY
Amy is walking into the building.

119.
AMY (V.O.)
The man on the spot is Aaron
Conners, and his arena is a silent,
antiseptic operating room-INT. VANITY FAIR WAITING ROOM - DAY
Amy is sitting waiting for an appointment.
AMY (V.O.)
--on a Tuesday morning, where he is
about to sew Amar’e Stoudemire’s
battered 20 million dollar knee
together.
INT. VANITY FAIR OFFICES - DAY
Amy sits across from DAVID (fifties, well dressed). They are
in his impressive office. David is reviewing Amy’s portfolio.
AMY (V.O.)
Time is ticking, pressure builds
and he goes for it.
INT. AARON’S OFFICE - DAY
Aaron opens an envelope. He pulls out Vanity Fair and flips
to Amy’s article which is marked. He smiles tentatively.
AMY (V.O.)
I on the other hand, just woke up
still drunk with dried cheese under
my fingernails, leading me to
believe that I ordered fries before
passing out on the floor. Life
hurts. But spending time with Dr.
Conners showed me that you can’t
play scared. And maybe every
drunken night, accidental ride on
the Staten Island Ferry and awkward
sexual encounter were just practice
for this. The main event.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amy is watching the game and getting ready.

120.
MARV ALBERT (V.O.)
Since the beginning of training
camp Knick fans have wondered when
do they get back their number one.
Well, the answer is tonight. Amar’e
Stoudemire is back in action for
the Knicks. Hi everybody I’m Marv
Albert and welcome to sold out
Madison Square Garden where Knicks
fans are holding their breath to
see if Amar’e Stoudemire’s
surgically repaired knee will bring
new hope as they tip off another
season looking to get back into the
playoff picture. It’s the Knicks
and the Nets coming up next.
Amy leaves.
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
Aaron greets Amar’e on court.
AARON
How you doing? How’s the knee
feeling?
AMAR’E
Feels great. Feels awesome.
EXT. NY STREET - NIGHT
Amy tries to hail a cab. None are available.
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
Game play. Aaron watching. Amar’e going in.
MARV ALBERT (V.O.)
Amar’e Stoudamire is checking in
and it is a standing ovation.
EXT. NY STREET - NIGHT
Amy rushes to the subway.
INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
Amy swipes her card goes through turn styles.

121.
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
The subway car stops. A collective groan from the strangers.
AMY
Why are we stopped?
ANGRY SUBWAY PATRON
You know sometimes on these short
trains you know it doesn’t touch
that third rail where the
electricity is and that red light
comes on and the power just shuts
off.
Really?

AMY

ANGRY SUBWAY PATRON
No, I don’t fucking know. Do I look
like I work for MTA?
AMY
I don’t know.
ANGRY SUBWAY PATRON
I got MetroCards in my fucking
purse now? What the fuck man? You
ask me some stupid shit.
I’m sorry.

AMY

JOSTLED SUBWAY PATRON
Don’t lean into me.
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
Knicks game in progress.
MARV ALBERT (V.O.)
Pierce off the drive, it is blocked
by Stoudamire. And he comes up with
the ball. Under four to play here
in the first. Smith finding
Stoudamire. That gets the crowd
going.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
Amy runs into the Garden.

122.
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ENTRANCE TUNNEL - NIGHT
ALDEN
Hey Dr. Conners.
Hey.

AARON

ALDEN
Amar’e looked good tonight.
AARON
Yeah I’m happy for him.
ALDEN
Actually he’s looking for you. He
said to meet you on court.
AARON
On court? Right now?
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
The garden is empty. Aaron walks out. Music starts. The
Knicks City Dancers come out. Amy is among them, in the
outfit, dancing.
Amy?

AARON

Amy attempts to keep up with the steps, she struggles, but is
giving it her all. At a music change it gets very street. Amy
gets very into it. Aaron claps and smiles. Another music
change. She does the dance and is kind of nailing it.
Aaron calls Amy over to him.
Come here.
I’m sorry.

AARON (CONT’D)
AMY

AARON
No, I’m sorry. And you are really,
really good.
AMY
As it turns out I am in terrible
physical shape.
AARON
I saw that.

123.
AMY
Could you see that? I am sweating
more than I am proud of.
AARON
Hey, I really missed you.
AMY
I missed you.
They kiss. Music change.
AMY (CONT’D)
Oh shit I have to dance more.
AARON
What? Amy you really don’t need to
do that.
The acrobatic dunkers from the Slam Dunk Contest appear.
AARON (CONT’D)
Why’s there a mat? Oh shit these
guys.
Amy appears with a basketball.
AARON (CONT’D)
No. Amy. Bad idea. Cut it. No.
Amy starts running for the trampoline in slow motion. Amy
takes off, hits the trampoline to dunk, but falls flat on her
face. The music stops. Aaron runs over.
AARON (CONT’D)
Amy. Amy. You ok?
AMY
Did I get it?
AARON
Did you get the basket?
AMY
Did it go in?
AARON
Oh of course not. You didn’t get
enough height.
No?

AMY

124.

No.

AARON

AMY
I thought I got a lot of height.
AARON
No height. Usually when people hit
trampolines they go high, but for
some reason you just went down. You
went straight down.
AMY
I really wanted to impress you. I
wanted to show you I can work hard
and put myself out there.
AARON
I got that.
AMY
And not be afraid to fail.
AARON
No, I got the metaphor.
AMY
Cause with the dance I wanted to
show you us. Cause I want to try
with you.
Aaron is very touched.
AARON
I want to try too.
AMY
I love you.
Yeah?
Yeah.

AARON
AMY

AARON
I love you too Amy.
They kiss. The Knicks City Dancers cheer.
We pull out and see that they are on the JumboTron. They
smile and make out as the music plays.
