Dear Beloved,
The Soul, The Spirit And Conscious Of This Script DA 5 BLOODS Is Our
Brother MARVIN GAYE'S OPUS - WHAT'S GOING ON. All Of The Songs On This
G.O.A.T Album Will Be Interwoven Into The Fabric Of This Joint. As
Marvin Said "In 1969 Or 1970, I Began To Reevaluate My Whole Concept Of
What I Wanted My Music To Say. I Was Very Affected By Letters My
Brother (Frankie - Who Did 3 Tours In Vietnam) Was Sending Me From
Vietnam, As Well As The Social Situation Here At Home. I Realized That
I Had To Put My Own Fantasies Behind Me If I Wanted To Write Songs That
Would Reach The Souls Of People. I Wanted Them To Take A Look At What
Was Happening In The World". WHAT'S GOING ON Would Most Def Be The
Vinyl That Was Spinning In The Homes Of Our BLACK VIETNAM VETS Like
PAUL, OTIS, MELVIN, EDDIE And NORMAN, When DA 5 BLOODS Returned From
The War To The War At Home. Peace And Love. Onward And Upward,
Kevin Willmott and Spike Lee.

INT. TAXI - HO CHI MINH CITY - VIETNAM - DAY

1

OTIS, A youthful 69, The Rock Solid, Medic of The Squad, he
kept them all alive. A Family Man who recently lost his Wife
to Breast Cancer. He’s now alone and lonely. In the back seat
with him is PAUL, 69, Stormin’ Norman’s Main Man, now full of
Blue Collar resentment. He has a paranoid intensity and a
Hair Trigger Temper that’s only grown worse with age.
OTIS
Twenty hours in the air. My Black
Ass is officially kicked.
Otis rotates his stiff neck and arches his sore back. He pops
a Pill chasing it with bottled water.
PAUL
Can’t believe we back in Dis Bitch,
Saigon.
OTIS
No Saigon. Ho Chi Minh City, Baby.
Paul and Otis looking out at how the City has changed.
Skyscrapers, Office buildings. A New Modern Beautiful City!
PAUL
Damn Hands sweatin’. Ain’t felt dis
way since the last time I was “In
Country.”
OTIS
Hey, you the one suddenly got all
Gung Ho about returning. You knew I
always had my reasons to come back.
PAUL
Yeah, times running out. We ain’t
getting no younger. I Dream about
dis damn place every night. Maybe
this’ll put my PTSD Shit in check.
OTIS
Tell me ‘bout it.
PAUL
Y’know, Man, my memories grow old
wit’ me.
OTIS
What do you mean?

3.
PAUL
Da incidents never change, but I
do. I age within da memory.
Otis listens. You can see he is realizing it too.
OTIS
Yeah, weird, like the memory
changes with you. Like an update.
PAUL
Shit always stays current. I can’t
get this Country out my head, now
here I am, back in dis God forsaken
place of my own Free Will.
OTIS
I recall back in 68’ somebody
tellin’ me he volunteered to serve
his “Country, Tis Of Thee.”
Paul has to grin.
PAUL
See you remember dat Shit.
OTIS
Oh Yeah, that’s when we knew like
Richard Pryor said... Dat Niggas
crazy.
PAUL
You got to understand back then, I
was Young, Cock Strong, Dumb as a
Rock. There’s a reason dey don’t
send Old Men to Fight in The War.
OTIS
We wouldn’t go.
PAUL
You damn right. We know Death is
Real. When you Young, you think you
Ain’t Never Gonna’ Die.
Paul hands Otis something. We don’t see it. Otis looks at it,
then he looks at Paul, who remains silent. Otis slips the
envelope in his jacket looking out at the passing City.
OTIS
Yeah, War is hell. I just keep
tellin’ myself. We’re doin’ it for
Norman.

INT. HOTEL MAJESTIC - HO CHI MINH CITY - VIETNAM - DAY

EDDIE, also 69, was one of the few Black Battle
Photographers. He’s dressed in affluent Southwest style,
owner of a string of Car Dealerships, who has gone through
numerous Wives and Gallons of Courvoisier. He gives Paul a
Big Bear Hug longing for a Bloods Reunion for years. Eddie
does however have one pronounced FLAW, He is Pigeon Toed - A
LOT. Da Bloods DAP each other up.
Gawwwdamn!

EDDIE

MELVIN
Damn, Eddie. You still Pigeon Toed.
Couldn’t get that fixed?
EDDIE
Decided not to. Why Bother? Da
Ladies Love It. And also did y’know
Jackie Robinson, John Elway,
Agassi, Messi, Neymar, Mookie and
Michael Jordan are Pigeon Toed too?
MELVIN, 65, so desperate to enlist he lied about his age,
then learned War Kills and developed a “Live For Today”
selfish attitude that made him among things a Pussy Hound. He
dresses and acts way too Hip for his age. He nears Otis
breaking into a elaborate “Dap” handshake from Back In Da
Day. They all laugh! Melvin holds his hand up to give Paul
some “Dap.”
PAUL
I can’t remember none of dat
Foolishness.
They hug. It’s an Explosive Reunion as Otis and Paul greet
Melvin and Eddie after so many years.
EDDIE
Man, it’s good to see ya’ll!!!
OTIS
Can you believe dis Shit?
MELVIN
I’m tellin’ ya! It’s a Stone Cold
Trip US bein’ back in Country.
MAN!!!
OTIS
Yeah, we stepped off dat Plane and
that Heat slapped us right upside
da head just like back in ‘68.

5.
EDDIE
Brother Man, We are back!!!
MELVIN
Da Bloods iz back!!!
PAUL
Da Five Bloods don’t die, We just

Melvin does a SLAP shake with Otis. Otis corrects.
OTIS
Soon to be Five...
A joyous moment of silence.
...Amen.

MELVIN

Eddie SNAPS photos of the Bloods with his Nikon Camera. It’s

Eddie nears the Hotel Counter.
OTIS (CONT’D)
What happened to all those pictures
you took Back in the Day?
EDDIE
Had some Exhibits. Officially they
were the U.S. Army’s not mine.
Eddie hands Otis a B/W Photo. Otis is immediately moved.
OTIS
Check this out.
Melvin and Paul gather around seeing...
A PHOTO of STORMIN’ NORMAN in his Hooch. On his Wicker Chair
Throne, M-16 in one hand like a Black Panther Huey P. Newton.
MELVIN
DAMN! Brother Man in all his Glory.
Paul stares at it longer than the others.

6.
Eddie SLAPS his American Express Black Card down speaking to
The Hotel Clerk KMUE.
EDDIE
Sir, make sure all Four of The
Rooms are on My Card.
PAUL
No Thank You. I’m good.
EDDIE
On me. Remember?
PAUL
No, I got mines.
EDDIE
What? Come on, we agreed...
OTIS
...We talked about this.
PAUL
I’m not your Welfare Charity Case.
EDDIE
Nobody said that.
PAUL
We all know yo’ Black Ass Da
biggest Car Dealership in Da
Fuckin’ World. Keep your money.
EDDIE
I see your Head is still Hard as
Hell.
PAUL
Like My Swanson Johnson.
EDDIE

Before it’s too late.
Eddie stands with his drink.
EDDIE
Man, I called some Kid “Brother”
the other day and he looked like he
wanted to Fuckin’ kill me. Listen
to us. Each one of us out for
ourselves now. Back in the Day
being a Brother meant something. We
fought against The Man. We loved
each other! We became Ace Boon Coon
Blood Brothers in that Damn Jungle!
PAUL
Stormin’ Norman demanded it!

11.
Otis stands, also declaring The Mission.
OTIS
Damn right he did! We died for a
Cause that wasn’t ours, for Rights
we didn’t have. This time! We do it
for a Brotherhood we done forgot...
EDDIE
...But God willing, never lost.

OTIS
Bloods, this is our Guide Vinh.
VINH
Gentleman, welcome back to Vietnam.
ANGLE - PATIO TABLE
Vinh is seated with the others. He opens a Folder, passing
around printed itineraries.
VINH (CONT’D)
I still think hiking into The
Jungle without me as your Guide is
a Big mistake.
Da Bloods look over the itinerary, satisfied.
PAUL
We know dat Jungle.
VINH
You have the necessary Documents?
Otis pulls out an Envelope and removes Two Sheets of paper.
He passes them to Vinh.
OTIS
From The Pentagon and The
Vietnamese Government. We locate
Norman’s remains, DPM Double A will
send a Recovery Team to bring him
Home...
PAUL
...Arlington National Cemetery.
Paul isn’t listening. He’s watching a GROUP of SIX VIETNAMESE
MEN, 70’s, at a nearby table. The Men stare back.

12.
PAUL
What da Fuck do dey want?
Everyone looks over. One of the Vietnamese Men waves to Paul.
Chill.

MELVIN

DUC, A WAITER approaches with a round of Drinks, and says
something to Vinh in Vietnamese.
VINH
Those Gentlemen would like to buy
us a round. They are Former Viet
Cong and welcome you back to their
Country.
Da Bloods all turn to the former VC Soldiers. A VIETNAMESE
Male NGUYEN, HOUANG in a WHEELCHAIR next to him, they nod
respectfully to them.
VINH
One of them is my Cousin Nguyen and
my Father’s younger Brother.
EDDIE
But you are from the South...
VINH
...And they fought for the North.
Nguyen does Tours for North
Vietnamese Tourists...
Nguyen smiles, he raises his glass again.
VINH (CONT’D)
It turned Vietnamese Families
against Vietnamese Families.
The Former V.C. Raise their glasses to the Bloods. Eddie,
Otis and Melvin toast their drinks in return but not Paul.
Paul...

OTIS

PAUL
For all we know, one of those Gooks
zapped Norm.
Otis sees everyone on the Patio is watching with interest...
The slur doesn’t slip by Vinh.

MELVIN
Yeah, it’s a whole different place.
They pass McDonald’s, KFC, Burger King and Pizza Hut.

Finger Lickin’ Good.

EXT. TIEN’S APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT

Otis walks to the front door it opens. TIEN LUU, a slender
Woman in a Black Dress, stands in the doorway. She stares at
him, both speechless. She’s nearly his age, but looks Much
Younger. Tien and Otis are overcome. They haven’t seen each
other in Years.
OTIS
You’ve hardly changed.
TIEN
We both know that’s not true. But
Thank You for being so kind.
A well-appointed Penthouse with Floor-To-Ceiling windows

TIEN
Who do you have with you?
OTIS
Just The Bloods.
TIEN
Bloods. I have not heard that word
in such a long time.
She tries to remember all the names.
TIEN
...And Eddie, Paul, Melvin? They're
good too?
OTIS
Good as they’re gonna’ get.
She reflects knowing what he means. Otis moves to Tien.
OTIS (CONT’D)
We had a Bond, back then, Stronger
than The War. Hope we can find it
again.
TIEN
Still The Medic, always full of
Hope.
Otis accepts it. Tien goes back to business.
TIEN
The Gold belongs to The Vietnamese
Government. Monsieur Victor
Desroche can convert The Gold into
Cash. He's the only person I know
who can handle a transaction of
this size.
OTIS
You’ve dealt with him before?
TIEN
Yes. He’s very expensive. Could be
Fifteen, even Twenty percent.

13

21.
TIEN (CONT'D)
There's also the issue of my Cut...
I'll need Ten Percent.
OTIS
There's no other way to move it?
TIEN
International Exports are my
Business. It's why you called me.
OTIS
That’s not the only reason.
He waits but no response from her. The Front Door opens...
ANGLE - MICHON
46, Blasian, walks in with groceries, a stunning Professional
Woman. She pauses seeing Otis sitting there staring at her.
MICHON
(In Vietnamese)
I believe this is everything you
wanted from The Market.
She sets the Grocery Bags down in The Kitchen.
TIEN
Come here I want to introduce you
to someone.
Otis stands as Michon nears him.
TIEN (CONT’D)
This is my daughter Michon. This is
my Old Friend Otis... From The
American War.
They both stare into each others eyes, shaking hands,
accessing one another. You can see him in her.
OTIS
Very nice to meet you.
It is awkward, stilted, finally.
MICHON
I should go.
TIEN
Thank you, Dear.
Michon leaves, clearly affected. Otis looks at Tien.

22.
OTIS
That Our Daughter?
Tien calmly sits down.
Yes.

TIEN

Otis lowers to his seat, stunned.
TIEN (CONT’D)
She was a Bastard Child of The
Enemy. I was a Whore. Her Father
was a Moi, a Nigger...
Otis listens.
TIEN (CONT’D)
...White GI’s taught us that word.
Everyone wanted us out. We were too
Dirty to even clean Toilets. They
call our Daughter a Cockroach.
OTIS
You wanted Michon to meet me.
I did.
Why?

TIEN
OTIS

TIEN
She deserves that. So do you.
Otis is just blown away.
TIEN (CONT’D)
Michon is your Daughter. I ask
nothing of you. You have your own
Life.
OTIS

Tien is taken aback, surprised. She studies him.

An Old French Colonial Palace. Ceiling fans. Plantation
shutters. Otis enters looking around seeing
IN A SIDE ROOM (OTIS’ POV)
VICTOR DESROCHE, 70’s, a Gauloises Chain-Smoking Frenchman in
a timeless White Linen Suit. He is in the middle of an
intense conversation with Tien. She pleads to him in French.
TIEN
Ces hommes signifient beaucoup pour
moi. Je veux que tu sois honnête et
à l’avant avec eux. Promets-moi de
faire ça. (These Men mean a great
deal to me. I want you to be honest
and up front with them. Please
promise you will do that)
Otis stares, listening. Desroche gently touches her face.
DESROCHE
Ah mon chéri, tu sais que je suis
toujours honnête et à l’avant. (Ah,
My Darling, you know I am always
Honest and up Front.)
Paul comes in behind Otis seeing them.
PAUL
What The Fuck they talkin’ about?

Tien sees them, breaking it off, approaching with Desroche.
ANGLE - ALL are seated.
Otis observes Desroche’s Gold Cuff-Links, Gold Lighter,
Pocket Square and Pink Gold Pinkie Ring as Paul, Melvin,
Eddie sit across from him and Tien.
DESROCHE
How many did you say you have?
OTIS
How many can you handle?
Desroche smiles but it’s more cunning than warm.
DESROCHE
The entire amount.
OTIS
Must be. Two hundred? U.S. Eagle
with Serial Numbers.
DESROCHE
That won't be a problem. May I ask
how did they end up in your
possession?
Paul, Wound-Up Tight, cuts in.
PAUL
You ask a lotta’ Goddamn
questions...
DESROCHE
Monsieur maybe they’re from a Bank
you just knocked off in Manila.
Maybe the Authorities are looking
for them. I don’t need that kind of
trouble.
MELVIN
We ain’t no Damn International
Criminals, Ya Dig?
DESROCHE
In my line of work, I must be
careful and that means knowing what
I'm getting myself into.
PAUL
You getting on my Last Goddamn
Nerve.

25.
DESROCHE
Gentlemen, I believe Our Business

Paul stands up over Desroche.
PAUL

Paul sits down. Desroche lights another Gauloises with his
Gold Lighter, then takes a big pull and blows The Smoke Into
The Air.
DESROCHE
And I Thank You for this American
One Sided Version of World War II.
Tien tries to reassure Desroche.
TIEN
Detendez-vous, Victor. Permettezmoi de leur parler. (Relax, Victor.
Let me talk to them.)
Desroche shrugs, crushing his Gauloises Cigarette in a Gold
Ashtray. Tien turns to Otis.
TIEN (CONT’D)
You must understand. He’s taking a
big risk...

26.
PAUL
...And we ain’t ...De Roach or

STORMIN’ NORMAN

STORMIN’ NORMAN
We abscond this Gold for every

Otis looks at Paul. Eddie and Melvin, ponder it.
STORMIN’ NORMAN

Stormin’ Norman sticks his Clenched Fist out over The Gold.
Otis extends his fist. Then Eddie and Melvin. Finally, Paul.

DESROCHE
You are more informed than you

Desroche lights another Gauloises Cigarette, thinking it

to The Vets.
DESROCHE
This is my offer per Kilo, less my

OTIS
Tien said twenty.
DESROCHE

Paul grabs David by the shirt and SLAMS him against the wall.
PAUL
Ungrateful Lil’ Black Studies

David remains totally cool. Which is what scares Paul.

DAVID
Get off me.

Melvin and Paul both laugh.
On the other side of The Boat, Otis and David talk quietly.

Purpose. Taught us about Black
History, no one knew that Shit back
then. Schooled us about drinking
that Anti-Commie Kool-Aid they was

them.
David turns to see a Woman, HEDY BOUVIER, 30’s, entering.
Tall, Fit and FINE, wearing well-worn hiking gear. Her Tshirt for LAMB, features a Skull and Crossbones. The Slogan,
“LOVE AGAINST MINES AND BOMBS”.
TWO MEN in identical T-shirts, SIMON and SEPPO, 30’s, are
standing next to her, unloading gear.

46.
DAVID
Didn't think I'd meet another
American up here.
HEDY
I’m French.
The Men nod, then go back out for the rest of their stuff.
Hedy has to grin.
HEDY (CONT’D)
Traveling alone?
DAVID
I'm with a group of Vietnam Vets.
One is my Father.
HEDY
Must be amazing coming back after
all these years with him.
DAVID
Yeah. It’s amazing all right... Is
there a place to go at Night around
here?
HEDY
There is a Bar a couple of Streets
down, on the River. Can't miss it.
DAVID
I'll see you there? Maybe.
Maybe.

HEDY

She grins, grabs her backpack, and starts to head upstairs.
DAVID
What is your Name?
HEDY
Hedy, like Hedy Lamarr... Old Time
Movie Star but my last name is
Bouvier.
DAVID
Cool. I’m David like David Ruffin
from The Temptations.
They both laugh.

Paul stands at a railing looking out over the Water smoking a
Cigarette. In deep thought, he sees...
SLAP! Paul looks at Otis’ hand on his shoulder. He offers
Otis a Cigarette pack with a colorful Vietnamese Logo.
OTIS
Cancer Sticks, gave them up years
ago.
Me too.

PAUL

Paul stares at TWO VIETNAMESE MEN, QUAN 30’s, and his Brother
CHAVY 20’s. They walk up to the rail, talking quietly.
Paul eyes them warily, then flicks his Cigarette Butt into
the water. He strolls away. Otis follows.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I spotted them earlier. When we
were checking in.
Otis listens to Paul, not buying it but not showing him.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Got a feelin’ I haven’t felt in a
long time. Like I’m bein’ Hunted...
Otis looks down at the Two Men again. They appear normal.

Jammed with Local Customers.
Melvin at The Bar drinking and talking to ANH and NU. Eddie
sits near but is just drinking.
David and Hedy sit at a table, a couple of Tropical Drinks
between them. Simon and Seppo shoot Pool nearby.
DAVID
So how long are you here for?
HEDY
Head out early morning.

48.
David nods to Simon and Seppo.
DAVID
What's their story?
HEDY
Simon's my Best Friend. Seppo and I
use each other for Sex Once in a
Blue Moon.
David nods. He looks over at Seppo, who eyes him back.
HEDY (CONT’D)
What about you? Girlfriend? Wife?
Kids? Married?
DAVID
Just Me, Myself and I.
HEDY
Dey-La-Soul.
They both laugh.
DAVID
Can I buy you another?
Please do.

HEDY

David motions to The Waitress. Another Round.
DAVID
What do you, Simon and Seppo do?
HEDY
We locate old Land Mines, Detonate
Bombs too.
DAVID
Woo!!! That’s some Gangsta Shit. So
how does one end up in The Mine and
Bomb Disposal Business?
HEDY
The Bouvier’s has a History in
Vietnam.
She looks over at Eddie knocking them back at The Bar with
his Two New Friends.
DAVID
My Father... we ain’t close. Never
would talk to me about it.

49.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Heard him tell somebody being
called a Baby Killer didn’t bother
him as much as being called a Uncle
Tom.
HEDY
Uncle Tom? I do not know that term.
DAVID
Uncle Tom, A Traitor to The Race.
Everyone was back home fighting for
Civil Rights he was here fighting a
White Man’s War.
HEDY
It’s strange how War never ends for
those involved. Like the Land
Mines. Planted years ago. Still
harvesting Death all these years
later.
DAVID
Back to your Family History.
HEDY
Well, let’s just say... my
Family... benefited from The War.
DAVID
Now you got me curious.
HEDY
I shouldn’t have brought it up.
DAVID
Hey, I understand...
David backs off. Hedy says it.
HEDY
My Family made several Fortunes
owning a Rubber Plantation, then we
bought up much of The Rice Market
and made another Fortune. WHITE
GOLD.
Jezzus.

DAVID

HEDY
Was a wonderful Family Business.
One exception, We exploited the
Shit out of The Vietnamese people.

50.
She takes a sip from her Drink.
DAVID
So that’s the meaning behind The
Mines.
She nods, taking another drink.
DAVID (CONT’D)
What do the Bouvier’s Family think
of what you do?
HEDY
What Family?
She covers but David sees it still hurts her.
HEDY (CONT’D)
I joined LAMB three years ago.
Never looked back.
LAMB?

DAVID

HEDY
Love Against Mines And Bombs. I’m
leader of a Rapid Response Team.
David looks at her, listening. Impressed.
HEDY (CONT’D)
I must look like some Patty Hearst
Style Heiress who’s cast herself as
a French guilt ridden Liberal
Stereotype.
DAVID
Hey, I know all about Liberal
Stereotypes. I’m a Poverty Stricken
idiot that Loves teaching.
Hedy has to smile.
DAVID (CONT’D)
However, my guilt trip is a little
less dangerous than yours... Except
for School shootings.
Hedy laughs.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I wasn’t joking. School shootings
are no FUN.

He gestures to Eddie at The Bar. David turns seeing Eddie,
clearly loaded, standing now with Melvin, Anh and Nu.
SIMON (CONT’D)
He's getting pretty loaded.
SEPPO

Vitun Amerikkalaiset, Kannissa Ku
Kale. (Fucking Americans. He’s

Seppo leans in getting into Hedy and David’s Business.
SEPPO (CONT’D)
Do you know how many Children are

DAVID
I’m sure too damn many.
SEPPO
Do you know most of those Mines
were made in America?
DAVID
I didn’t know that.
SEPPO
Of course you don't...
SIMON
...Over 900,000 Tons of Bombs were
dropped too.
Seppo and David’s eyes meet. He is picking a Fight.
SEPPO
You Americans are Criminally
uninformed. I guess you’re too busy
watching Reality TV and electing a
Reality TV Clown for a President.
HEDY
Seppo, don't...
David raises his hand like he is being Sworn In.
DAVID
...Well, on behalf of all The Black
People of the U.S.A., who are the
ONLY group who did not vote for

Eddie draws a worn Green Boonie Hat from his pack. In faded
Black Marker is a BLACK POWER and the words "RIGHT ON.”
In Answer, Paul puts on his Trump Cap. David sprays him down
with insect repellent. Paul then sprays down David.

Melvin removes his Hat and wipes his head with a Bandanna.
MELVIN
Paul, you can still hump it out On
Point.
DAVID
What happens if one of us gets
Heat Stroke or sprains an Ankle?
EDDIE
Otis is a Medic. A Good One.
David nears Melvin holding out his hand. Melvin gives him
some “Dap” teaching him.
PAUL
Even took a couple of rounds out of
me once.
MELVIN
From your Black Hairy Ass as I
recall.
Melvin gives David a WINK. Otis limps up, struggling. Eddie
takes another Drink from his Canteen.
OTIS
What is that?
EDDIE
Water. What? You wanna smell my
breath?
Otis backs down, feeling a little Foolish.
OTIS
Let’s just keep moving.
As the Men heft their packs on, Eddie surreptitiously unwraps
a piece of GUM and pops it in his mouth.

58.
Otis adjusts his pack, wincing in pain. He takes out a Pill,
pops it in his mouth, and chews it. Grimacing at the bitter
taste, he washes it down with a swig of water.
EDDIE
What are those?
OTIS
Something for my Hip.
EDDIE
I know that! What are they?
OxyContin.

OTIS

Eddie starts LAUGHING.

Otis takes the lid off his Oxycontin and throws them in the
Bush. The Pills flying everywhere Lost Forever.
OTIS (CONT’D)
I don’t need dat Shit.
The Guys all know he does. Otis limps off, moving faster than
he should, fueled by Self-Pity. Paul holds out his hand.

DAVID
They’re Leopards out there.

PAUL

David tries to see it but Paul pulls him back.
PAUL (CONT’D)
It was just a Flash but I saw him.
DAVID
Maybe it was a Monkey.
PAUL

The Two stare into the dark for a long beat.
DAVID

Paul slowly rises, looking. It’s all clear.
PAUL

Love but I do know that. Love ya.
Father and Son return to the Fire. Melvin fights Mosquitos.
MELVIN
Where’s the Bug Spray?

Otis wakes up. He sits up seeing Melvin holding up the ‘45.

They all look at Otis waiting for an explanation.
PAUL

Otis charges Paul. They tumble to The Ground, scattering Mess
Kits and Provisions.

The Two Men grapple and trade Punches as Melvin, David and
Eddie try to pull them apart.
DAVID
Dad! Stop it!
They finally separate The Two. Paul yanks free of David.
DAVID (CONT’D)

David drops The Camp Shovel and scampers down The Hill. He
drops to his Hands and Knees and feels around in the
undergrowth.
Feeling SOMETHING, he excitedly tears away The Vegetation to

Melvin and Paul grab the handles on the sides of The Box.
They pull hard, muscles straining... SNAP!

disintegrates in a Shower of Rusted Metal Flakes. Paul
plunges a Shovel into The Dirt, desperately turning it over.
It’s just Earth. Flecked through with Rust and Bits of Metal.
The Men peer into The Dirt. DREAMS CRUSHED TO METAL BITS.
Eddie laughs, bitterly. David watches, Paul laughs too.
And Lo And Behold, despite THE PAIN Otis starts to DO A JIG.

They all get quiet.
OTIS
What about all those Car
Dealerships with your name on them?
EDDIE
I don’t own them. My Name is still

some of The Dealers choose to keep
it. They’ll pull it when it stops

Paul wearing Headphones takes a turn with The Metal Detector.
Eddie stares off. Otis turns to Melvin and David.
OTIS
If those Guys are gonna hit us.
It’ll be at night.
Great.

DAVID

Paul CALLS OUT from across the clearing.
PAUL
Bloods!!! I got something!!!
Eddie is the first on his feet. Otis, Melvin and David follow
him over to a spot where Paul is digging.
Paul pulls something out rubbing The Dirt off. It's an
AMERICAN M-16 RIFLE.
Eddie kneels next to Paul.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Let me do this.
Eddie stands back up.
CLOSE - PAUL
Digs with both HANDS, Slowly and Carefully.
Paul uncovers part of a Skull with a Dirt-Filled Eye Socket.
He digs around the Neck Area finding what he's looking for: A
PAIR OF DOG TAGS.
Paul rubs The Dirt off. The Tags read: "HOLLOWAY, NORMAN
EARL. 379-46-2286. A NEG. BAPTIST."
It’s Norm.

PAUL (CONT’D)

Paul breaks down Weeping on His Knees like A Baby. Otis looks
at him. Eddie and Melvin put their arms around each other,
GROWN MEN CRYING.
David goes to comfort his Father.
ANGLE - EXCAVATION SITE

71.
The last bit of Daylight is quickly fading. MARVIN GAYE’S
“Wholy Holy” Fades in.
Eddie pulls a Red, Black and Green Liberation Flag from his
Back Pack.
MELVIN
Like the one Norm always carried on
him.
Eddie nods. He spreads it out on the Ground. He places Norm’s
Skeletal remains on it. Melvin helps him. They fold the Flag
ceremoniously around Norman’s Remains.
The Black Nam Vets have covered Norm's Grave and roped off a
small area around it.
Otis lays some Flowers at the base of The Grave.
Otis and Melvin kneel next to The Grave. Paul just stands,
watching.
David watches from a few feet away moved by how emotional
this is for them.
Paul takes a Knee, Eulogizing.
PAUL
Hey Norm. It took us longer than we
thought but we came back, just like
we said we would. This time when we
get on that Plane to go back to The
World you’ll be coming with us.
Tears run down Melvin’s Face.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Both your Parents have passed, I
guess you know that but your
Sisters Janet and Kim will be
waiting to meet us when We land.
You're goin’ Home, Blood.
BAAM! A round just misses Paul’s Head splintering a Tree
behind him! Gunfire rips up around them! They hit The Dirt!
PAUL (CONT’D)
Where’s it comin’ from?
EDDIE
I didn’t see.
MELVIN
Anybody hit?

72.
David looks at all of them. Paul aims The Pistol, ready.
All good.

PAUL

OTIS
We should make A Run for that Open
Trail there.
Otis points in that direction.
PAUL
Tien, Da Roach, Vinh. Blood hidin’
Gun in your Bag.
Otis looks at Paul with disgust.
OTIS
You go right ahead and believe
that...
Otis head down takes off with his Back Pack for The Trail.
They all watch him disappear in The Darkness. Eddie decides
to follow. Then Melvin. David looks at his Father and dashes
off. No choice. Paul follows the others down The Trail.
55

EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - TALL GRASS MINEFIELD - DAY

Eddie and David stop to let the others catch up. Everyone's
glistening with Sweat. They take off their Packs and Stretch
their Aching Backs and Muscles.
Otis brings up The Rear, using a Bamboo as a Walking Stick.
Melvin stops. Otis and Eddie are both too winded to speak.
DAVID
I can manage another Thirty, Forty
Pounds.
Yeah?

MELVIN

OTIS
Oh Man, that’d be great.
As he starts to open his pack, Paul holds up a Hand.
PAUL
My Son plays Da Pack Mule. My Son
gets a Cut.
DAVID
It's Fine Dad.

73.
PAUL
The Hell it is. You’ve got half my
Goddamn Share.
MELVIN
When did you turn into a Grade A
First Rate Certified Tired and
Krazy Muthafucka?
PAUL
When you've been cheated as many
times as I have, you learn to spot
the signs of a Dirty Rat Bastard.
Otis just listens to him. Paul looks at Otis.
A Gold Bar lands at Paul’s Feet. Eddie stands there with an
open backpack and throws more Gold Bars at Paul.
EDDIE
How much do you want? Huh?
Eddie throws more Gold Bars.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
That enough? More?
Paul just looks at him. Eddie gets in his face!
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Do you remember! HUH! You remember
what Norm said about Money!!!
Eddie puts his Hand on Paul’s Shoulder.
SMASH CUT TO:

PAUL
I don’t remember dat.
Otis steps in trying to calm Eddie. He pushes him away.
EDDIE
NAW MAN! I’m tired a trying to make
you Fools Love each other!
Paul just looks at Eddie giving him nothing. Eddie’s had it.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Wanna tear each other apart! DO IT!

75.
Picks up a Gold Bar, walking backwards Pigeon Toed talking to
them.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Was hoping we’d be Bloods one more
time. But no, we ain’t never
getting that back. Not with this!
He holds up the Bar still walking backwards Pigeon Toed.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Traded Brotherhood for this Shit!
Means more than me, DON’T IT, PAUL!
PAUL
Muthafucka walks backward Pigeon
Toed.
Eddie takes out his Cell Phone.
EDDIE
Like a Rapper. Posing wit my Gold.
Holding the Gold Bar, kissing it. He poses for a Selfie with
his Phone. Grinning, the Gold Bar next to his Face like a
Post on his Instagram.
EDDIE (CONT’D)
Out for me, MYSELF and I now! FUCK
Y’ALL. I’M GETTING PAID.
He takes another Pigeon Toed step back...
--DIRT AND GRASS EXPLODE INTO THE AIR.
Eddie vanishes in The Blast. A FLYING GOLD BAR hits David in
the Chest, knocking him back a step. Da Bloods Hit the Deck.
MELVIN
DON’T MOVE.
As Bits of Grass float Back Down Out Of The Air, WHITE SMOKE
OBSCURES The Blast Site -- and Eddie.
Otis pushes past the others into The WHITE SMOKE.
MELVIN (CONT’D)
Otis, Stop!!! It’s a Minefield!
Otis ignores him and finds Eddie looking up at The Heavenly
Sky. Eddie’s Mouth is Full Of Blood. BOTH LEGS AND ARMS HAVE
BEEN BLOWN OFF and his Bowels are hanging out.
Gold Bars and Chunks of Flesh are scattered around Eddie.

76.
Otis kneels next to A DYING EDDIE.
OTIS
EDDIE!!! EDDIE!!!
Eddie just stares up at THE HEAVENS, mouth moving wordlessly.
A Large Bubble Of Blood forms on his Lips, then Pops.
Otis cradles a DYING EDDIE.
OTIS (CONT’D)
It’s Otis. I’m here.
Eddie’s Eyes Flick over and he seems to recognize Otis. More
Blood Burbles up Out Of His Mouth. Eddie’s Mouth moves but No
More Words come. Eddie SLIPS AWAY.
EDDIE...

OTIS (CONT’D)

But Eddie isn't looking at Otis. He stares Into THE BLUE
HEAVENS.
Bye.

EDDIE

Then Eddie is gone. Otis sits there, holding him. By now the
White Smoke has dissipated. Otis gently closes Eddie’s
Eyelids.
David steps on something!!!
WE HEAR A LOUD CLICK - David FREEZES
DAVID
Oh Jesus...
What?

PAUL

DAVID
Jezzus. I stepped on something.
EVERYONE Freezes In Place.
PAUL
Son, don’t move.
MELVIN
Muthafucka!!!
David holds tight. Not moving.

77.
Hedy, Simon and Seppo rush toward them emerging from The
White Smoke. Paul draws The ‘45!
DAVID
DAD NO!!! It’s Cool!!! They can
help!!!
Paul puts it away. Hedy and the others stop. She instructs.
HEDY
Everybody Freeze!
She looks over and sees what’s left of Eddie’s Body.
HEDY (CONT’D)
Oh my God...
Seppo notices Eddie’s Gold Bars scattered about. Otis points
to David.
OTIS
He stepped on something.
Hedy sees him.
HEDY
Could be a Field of Cluster Bombs.
Hedy directs Simon. He uses his Ground Penetrating Radar
device searching the ground moving closer to David.
ANGLE - DAVID
Now sweating Bullets. Simon reaches David’s Foot. The Device
emits a high pitched BEEPING sound.
SIMON
It’s a B.L.U., BOMB LIVE UNIT.
Hedy’s right, probably a Cluster
Bomb. Blue 26, size of a tennis
ball, but it’s enough to tear you
apart in half.
David nods. Paul, Otis and Melvin can only watch.
SEPPO
You’ve got to lead them out of
there.
Hedy points to Otis.

78.
HEDY
You stay there. And David don’t
move.
Hedy points to Paul and Melvin.
HEDY (CONT’D)
You two step back but only step in
your footprints. Nice and Easy.
Paul and Melvin both carefully back away, looking behind
themselves, stepping into their Footprints.
David watches the sweat rolling down his dark face.
Otis also watches holding his breath still clutching Eddie.
Melvin and Paul reach Hedy and Seppo. Safe.
Simon uses the Ground Penetrating Radar to reach Otis.
HEDY (CONT’D)
Slowly lay your Dead Friend to the
ground.
Otis gently lays Eddie down, and slowly gets up and joins
Simon as he leads to SAFE SPOT with the others.
David now stands there alone in the Minefield.
PAUL
What about my Son?
Hedy looks at Simon and Seppo, then to David, concerned.
HEDY
All he can do is lift up his Foot
and Pray to God it doesn’t explode.
Otis and Melvin are distraught! Paul is crazed.
PAUL
There’s got to be another way.
HEDY
If there is... we don’t know it.
OTIS
Fuck... Fuck-Fuck-Fuck!!!
Paul steps away, thinks, then turns to Otis.
PAUL
Jethro Bodine.

79.

What?

OTIS

PAUL
Remember that Big Ass Hillbilly
from Oklahoma. Remember he stepped
on that Toe-Popper. REMEMBER!
OTIS
Yeah, YEAH!
Paul points to Seppo.
PAUL
Gimme dat Rope.
Seppo produces a good amount of rope from one of their
backpacks. He hands it to Paul. Paul goes to David and
carefully ties the rope around his waist tightly. David is
sweating bullets.
Paul steps away holding The Rope out like he has lassoed
David. It stretches out 20 yards. Paul instructs the others.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I need everybody to grab the end.
Hedy, Simon, Otis, Melvin, Seppo they all grab the rope. Paul
grabs the end closest to David instructing him.
PAUL (CONT’D)
We’re gonna pull you off that Mine
before it blows. Just like we did
Jethro Bodine. Now on three we all
pull hardn’ a Muthafucka. GOT IT!
They get it. David looks down at his Foot, a Gold Bar, near
it. He then looks at Paul, who nods to him.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, Son, I got you. ONE!!!
All the hands tighten their grip around The Rope. It becomes
taunt and tight. David watches, sweating, eyes frightened.
TWO!!!

PAUL (CONT’D)

The hands tighten more. David’s eyes grow larger.
THREE!!!

PAUL (CONT’D)

80.
They pull HARD and David flies in The Air and off The Mine as
it explodes! BOOM!!!! Everyone pulled so hard they fall to
the ground like The Tug Of War Game.
David lands on his Father. He quickly turns around and looks
at his feet and the sole of his Boot is smoking. In a panic,
he kicks off his Boot examining his foot. It is fine.
On the ground, David hugs his Paul tightly. Their first
moment of Father and Son love.
Everyone erupts into Joy and Laughter! Otis and Melvin join
them helping the Two get to their feet. It is a nervous burst
of Relief and Celebration.

Simon and Seppo pat David on the back joining the
Celebration. David’s face falls looking over seeing his
Father...
ANGLE - PAUL
pointing the ‘45 at Hedy, Seppo and Simon.
PAUL
Git on your Knees. All Three of
you.
Everyone is stunned. David raises his hands trying to calm.
Dad...

DAVID

MELVIN
Put dat Damn Gun down! NOW!!
PAUL
We’re compromised!
Hedy, Simon and Seppo slowly raise their hands.
SEPPO
Okay, Okay. Just stay Cool.
HEDY
Whatever you're doing, it’s none of
Our Business. We can just go.
PAUL
The Sound of dat Blast traveled for
Miles. Whoever’s followin’ us, is
on their way here, right now.

81.
PAUL (CONT'D)
David, get Eddie’s Gold. We gotta
get the Fuck outta here!!!
David doesn’t move. Melvin stands there in Shock...
MELVIN
Are you serious?
DAVID
We gotta tell someone about Eddie.
The American Embassy...
PAUL
...We’re not tellin’ Nobody
Nuthin’.
MELVIN
SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!!!
OTIS
We have to bury Eddie.
PAUL
Are you Deaf! We got to get Da Hell
outta’ here. NOW!!!
Otis Finally Loses It.
OTIS
I’M NOT LEAVING EDDIE LIKE DAT!!!
Hedy stands up.
HEDY
Just let us help you...
Paul wheels the ‘45 toward them!
PAUL
...Can you bring back The Dead?
Huh? HUH? I said ON YA KNEES. NOW.
Hedy joins Simon and Seppo on their Knees. Afraid for their
very Life.
PAUL (CONT’D)
David, get Da Rope. Tie ‘em up!
DAVID
Not doin’ it.
OTIS
Let’s talk about this.

82.
PAUL
You're not givin’ Da orders! I’M
RUNNIN’ SHIT NOW.
ANOTHER CLUSTER BOMB GOES OFF!!! Sending everyone to the
ground.
Paul turns toward The Blast as Seppo lunges to his Feet
hurling himself at Paul. The Two Men crash to the ground.
Seppo is Younger and Stronger but Paul’s a Man Possessed.
SEPPO
Get The Gun!!!
Simon lunges to help. Everyone is against each other. Melvin
stops Simon. David grabs Seppo from behind. Otis grabs Paul
but he slings him off!
Paul pistol whips Seppo across The Face knocking him away,
who grabs his Face in pain! Paul shakes Otis loose, standing
over Seppo, The ‘45 pointing down at his Bleeding Face.
PAUL
Boy, I have killed far better Men
than you. I won’t hesitate to plug
a Hole in you.
Paul looks at David.
Tie em up!

PAUL (CONT’D)

ANGLE - DAVID
looks over at Hedy. Who gives him a challenging glare. “Do it
and we are done.”
PAUL (CONT’D)
You want your share? Tie em up!
David still doesn’t move.
PAUL (CONT’D)
You wanna remain my Son... then get
at it.
Paul grabs The Coil of Rope and tosses it to his David. Otis
holds a rag to Seppo’ face, watches. Melvin looks at Paul.
David picks it up and reluctantly ties up a disgusted Hedy.
HEDY
I had you pegged wrong.

83.
David finishes tying her. Otis presses a rag to Seppo’s
laceration. He steps away from Seppo as David ties him up.
Paul says to Melvin and Otis.
PAUL
You got something to say?
Otis and Melvin just stare at him, Silent.
58

EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - TALL GRASS - DAY

Paul nears Simon, instructing.
PAUL
Navigate us through The Mine Field.
Simon nods using the Mine Sweeper. Paul taunts The Attackers.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Try to follow us now, Bitches.
Otis and Melvin drag Eddie's Body into A Thicket. Otis places
a Blanket over him. He then picks up EDDIE’S CAMERA. He
stares at it, wiping it off, reflecting on his Friend.
Hedy, Seppo and Simon nearby watch, their Wrists bound.
Eddie’s Blood Speckled Gold is stacked up into Four Piles.
MELVIN
We should give Eddie’s share to his
Family.
Otis looks over at The Four Piles.
PAUL
It’s the Right Thing to Do.
MELVIN
What about your Son?
PAUL
Yeah, that’s my Boy. He gets a
share.
David stares at him.
Deal?

PAUL (CONT’D)

Melvin and Otis nod, agreeing.

84.
Paul goes over and starts putting his Stack in his Backpack.
Melvin and Otis step away, speaking quietly.
MELVIN
Need to get that ‘45 away from him.
OTIS
Tonight. When he’s sleeping. In the
meantime, don’t argue with him.
We’ll find our moment.
Simon has finished marking The Mines with A Trail of LITTLE
RED FLAGS.
Otis and Melvin stand over Eddie’s remains, Their Hands
Covered with His Blood.
MELVIN
So long, Blood. Rest In Peace.
Simon navigates The Minefield using the ground penetrating
Radar. Paul follows, holding Simon by A Rope Leash, The ‘45
trained on his back.
Otis and Melvin slowly get their Packs. David pulls on his
Pack, then tries to help Hedy along. Hedy jerks away.
They walk into the Minefield, dodging the Flagged Areas.
David and Otis follow. Melvin brings up the rear, plucking
The Red Flags out of the ground as He goes...

EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - TALL GRASS - DAY

59

The Vets and The Hostages hump down The Trail. Paul, Simon,
and Melvin are in The Lead. David, Hedy, Seppo and Otis bring
up The Rear. Seppo gives David a hard time.
SEPPO
I can’t believe back at that Bar I
was actually jealous of you.
David looks at him.
SEPPO (CONT’D)
You seemed so fuckin’ sure of
yourself. Should of known you were
actually a Spineless Fuckin’ Rat.
Hedy says nothing.

85.
SEPPO (CONT’D)
Hedy, you couldn’t still want him
knowing his demented Father is
about to murder us.
DAVID
Seppo, SHUT UP.
HEDY
David, he is going to Kill us. You
know that, right?
David looks at her. Paul, up front, shouts back.
PAUL
I said shut the Fuck Up back

They all go quiet.

Otis watches it all.

Paul, Melvin and Otis look over The Topo Map.
OTIS

The Rendezvous Point has changed?
PAUL
Vinh's out. He’s in Cahoots wit’
those Charlies. Right, Traitor?
OTIS
If you don’t trust me then just
shoot me when you Kill them.
Hedy, Seppo and Simon react their backs against a Tree tied
up. Paul stares at them for a long moment. Scary. Paul steps
away. Otis and Melvin exchange looks.
61

EXT. NEAR CAMP - NIGHT

61

Paul lays near Camp, 30 Yards away, scanning The Jungle with
Night Vision Binoculars. Melvin crawls over and joins him.
MELVIN
We'll never get our Money out of

Paul turns to Melvin and gives him a long hard look.

86.

How?

PAUL

MELVIN
With your Blade. March ‘em into The
Jungle. Quick and Quiet. In the
morning, we'll tell David and Otis
they escaped.
Paul ponders it, nods, agreeing to it.
PAUL
Okay, but You gotta do one of them.

MELVIN

PAUL
I gotta know you’re not going to

David mulls it over.
HEDY (CONT’D)
David, don't you want the First
Time you unzip and remove My Pants
to be under better circumstances?
DAVID
Not Buyin’ It. Ya Ain’t Playin’ Me.

87.
Hedy raises her hands. Please. A Beat, then David unties her.
Hedy pulls down her Pants and Squats. David turns his head,
stares past her, into The Darkness.
HEDY
Were you flirting with me the other
night because you were just looking
for an Easy Fuck or because you
were actually interested in me?
DAVID
Actually... I’m interested.
Why?

HEDY

DAVID
Because you left your Rich Family
behind to try to do something good,
Help People. And Ya Fine Too! Ain’t
Gonna Lie.
She stands, pulling up her pants. David shifts his gaze and
makes eye contact with her.
HEDY
Then let me go. Give me a Ten
Minute Head Start. All I ask.
Hedy steps closer to him, eyes pleading, and puts A Hand on
the back of his neck as if she might Kiss David...
Please.

HEDY (CONT’D)

Hedy stares at David. Paul has a closed Deadly Look.
MELVIN
Better do what your Father says.
David is Face to Face with his Father.
DAVID
Better not hurt them.
Or what?

PAUL

Melvin and Paul push Hedy and Simon on into The Jungle.
HEDY
David, you’re a worthless Fuck.
Hedy shouts not looking back at David.
HEDY (CONT’D)
Just so you know, I was only trying

He dashes into The Jungle, escaping.
Hedy and Simon start to run. Otis points the Gun at them.
Hold it.

OTIS

Hedy and Simon Freeze.
PAUL
Get Off me! DAVID!
DAVID
Let it go Dad!!!
They climb off Paul having tied him up. He sits bleeding
above his Left Eye from The Blow.
Paul looks up at Otis, SEETHING. Then laughs, sarcastic.
PAUL

Dope Fiend Double Cross. Don't you
see what Otis’ doin’? Playin’ right

David looks away.
PAUL (CONT’D)
Ungrateful Bastard! You're no Son
of mine! Hear me!!! You're Dead to

Coward!!!
Otis steps away with David and Melvin. Discussing quietly.
DAVID
If we don’t let them go now we
cross the line into Kidnapping.
OTIS

up.
PAUL
He’s callin’ his Partners. Makin’

Otis on the phone steps away. Melvin kneels before Paul.
David standing over him.
MELVIN
If you can behave yourself, we'll
let you put your pack on. You can
carry it out like the rest of us.
Your call.

Vinh peers into The Morning Mist and sees Figures emerging
from The Jungle. Melvin sees Vinh up ahead in the clearing
and raises A Hand.
He recognizes Melvin in The Lead and SMILES.
The Smile fades as he spots Hedy and Simon and notices Eddie
is missing. The Group is beyond exhausted. They’re Hungry,
Thirsty, covered with Mud and countless Scratches.
VINH

Melvin and David reach Vinh first. He reaches out to help
Melvin remove his pack.
MELVIN
I got it. Thanks.
Hedy, Simon and a Paranoid Paul follow. Otis struggles up The
Hill. Vinh rushes over to help him up.
VINH
Where is Eddie?
OTIS
Broke his Ankle. We left him with
Food and Water...
VINH
...I would have brought help. Why
didn't you call?
OTIS
Eddie insisted... Stubborn like a
Mule.
VINH
This is very bad. I knew you should
not go alone. I have a Friend in
The District. He'll send a Rescue
Group.
Vinh pulls out his Satellite Phone. Otis and Melvin react.
OTIS
How would you like to make the most
Money ever in your Life?
Vinh smiles. Then he notices The Blood on Otis' Pants.
VINH
Eddie did not Break an Ankle, did
he?
The Vets exchange a look. Otis decides to come clean.
No.

OTIS

VINH
You Kill him?
OTIS
No, no. Mine Field.
He’s interrupted by the sound of an APPROACHING VEHICLE.

93.
PAUL
Otis, it’s your Partners!!!
A Jeep rolls up in a cloud of dust, blocking the SUV. TWO
VIETNAMESE MEN with AK-47s hop out. Meet BAO and TAM.
VINH
Do you know these Men?
A VOICE SHOUTS in The Distance. Quan and his Brother Chavy.
As they approach, they reveal..
ANGLE - SEPPO
who has been captured and is now their very frightened
Hostage. He is tied up and looks even the worse than he did
when he was with the Bloods. Quan calls out to Vinh.
QUAN
Chúng tôi mu?n vàng c?a chúng tôi.
Cho nó lên (We want our Gold. Give
it over.)
VINH
He said you have his Gold.
PAUL
Forget that!!!
Quan approaches Otis, who tries to stand firm but is Edgy.
QUAN
We trade your Friend for Gold.
PAUL
He ain’t our Friend!
SEPPO
Hedy!!! For God sakes help me!!!
HEDY
David, you’ve got to help him.
Otis, Please!!!
Otis looks at her. He says to Quan pointing at Seppo.
OTIS
We want him alive.
Quan moves to Otis and points to bag. He grabs for The Bag,
ripping it and his Gold drops to the ground! THUD!!! Quan
picks up a couple of Bars grinning holding them up for his
Men to see. JACKPOT.

94.
Melvin closes his eyes, Fuck. Quan stunned. Smiles. Jackpot.

MELVIN

OTIS (CONT’D)
Listen. We can share it. There's
more than enough for everyone.
Amused, Quan translates for his Men:
QUAN
Ông mu?n chia s? nó v?i chúng
tôi.(You want to divide, which is
ours?)
They laugh again.
QUAN (CONT’D)
I like you, Black Uncle Sam. Okay,
We share.
He takes Otis' Hand and slaps a Single Bar into his palm,
hard, then crushes Otis' Fist with his own. Otis grimaces.
QUAN (CONT’D)
This share for you. Rest for us.
Quan shoves Otis.
QUAN (CONT’D)
Big Man mu?n chia s? ngay bây gi?
(Big Man wants to share now?)
They laugh at their Leader's witty remark.
Otis gives Melvin a look. Melvin has The ‘45. He slowly
brings his hand toward his waist.
Quan stops smiling and turns to Paul, trying to stare him
down. But Paul’s not afraid. He’s ready to explode.
DAVID
We’re Americans. If you kill him...
David points at Seppo.
DAVID (CONT’D)
...or us, you've got an
International...
QUAN

Gold in The Jeep.)
PAUL
Boy you ain’t takin’ what’s ours.

QUAN

PAUL

Quan nears Paul yanking off his Trump hat, pulling out a
wicked-looking Combat Knife, holding it to his face.
QUAN
That say USA but I don’t think so.
PAUL
Believe it. Who the Fuck are you?
QUAN

Otis and Melvin watch Bao and Tam boldly grab Two of The Gold
Packs and put them into The SUV.
PAUL

QUAN

Paul says nothing. Quan turns away from him glares at Paul.
QUAN
Do You Know Calley? Brother.
PAUL

He takes off running!

Simon SCREAM in horror! Everyone is stunned. Seppo has

Vinh pulls a Norinco M-77 HANDGUN from beneath The Driver's
seat. Quan picks up his AK marching toward Paul, SHOUTING!
QUAN (CONT’D)

Shock and Sadness. They walk over looking at the hole.

Vinh crawls from under The SUV, getting in, starting The SUV.
Melvin nears him. The GAUGE is very low! Vinh strikes the
steering wheel. He turns off The SUV.
Paul nears Otis still in the ditch. Otis ties a tourniquet
around David’s Upper Leg bandaging it up.
OTIS (CONT’D)
Relax, it’s just a Mosquito bite.

Otis and rips The Phone free SMASHING it against the SUV.
Everyone is stunned.
MELVIN

Paul squares off like He’s ready for A Showdown.

99.
PAUL (CONT’D)

OTIS

Melvin shakes his head, stepping away. Vinh Nears Otis.
VINH
We have very little Gas perhaps
enough Gas to reach some Ruins a
few miles from here.
OTIS
What advantage would that give us?
VINH
If you choose to fight these Men
you need some defenses.
PAUL

PAUL
He’s no Son of mine. He’s a Fuckin’
Muthafuckin’ Back-Stabber!
Paul gives David a Hateful look. David says nothing. Paul
spits he is finished! They sit David in the back of the SUV.
VINH
We need to go. Now.
Paul collects weapons and spare Mags from The Dead. Everyone
gets in The SUV. Paul watches. Settled they stare at him.
OTIS
You coming?
PAUL
My Share is mine again. He gets
Doodly Squat.
David looks away from him too hurt to even look anymore.
OTIS

PAUL

Head, taking off down The Trail, vanishing into Da Jungle.

OTIS
I’m a God fearing Man and Da Lawd
knows I’ve been blessed with a
Great Woman, Cindy. I’m the
Luckiest Man in The World but
between you and me sometimes, I
don’t feel that way. I feel like a
Bum. The Bum who couldn’t provide
as much as he should have for his
Saint of a Wife and Kids. Back when
we were in College all those
Bougie, Light Skin, Green Eyed,
Curly Hair, Ralph Lauren, Polo
Wearing and Shiny Penny Loafing
wearing Dudes were all over My
Cindy like White on Rice. Cindy had
her pick, coulda been living a Good
life, Summer Home in Martha’s
Vineyard and whatnot but she didn’t
Love Em’. Big Money or not. Cindy
Love Me. Married Me. I pleaded with
her, told her I’m not that Guy, I’m
just a simple Working Class
Brother. Cindy, said “I Love You”.
I wish I coulda got her all the
nice things she truly deserved.
From Day One we have been living
from Paycheck to Paycheck, trying
to make Ends meet. I did the Best I
could.

Kept Roof over our Heads, hand me
down clothes on our Kids backs,
Food on The Table, Cindy was a
great Writer in College but gave it
up and took a job as a Librarian,
never wrote one Single Word againEver. Only Reads. Cindy sacrificed
her artistic Life for my Black
Broke Ass and our Kids. I Blame
myself. Blood this is my Last and
Final Chance to make it up to my
Partner in Life, for her to live in
comfort the years she has left.
Maybe Cindy can start to write that
Novel she always talked about. I
will send our Grandchildren to
College. My share of this Gold is
for Cindy so help me God. If I go
out, I need to go out like a Man.
MELVIN

does not make their sacrifice any
greater. This is simply business.)
