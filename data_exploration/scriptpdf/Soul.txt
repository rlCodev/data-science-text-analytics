A BAD MIDDLE SCHOOL BAND PLAYS THE DISNEY LOGO THEME.
ONCE IT ENDS...
JOE (O.S.)
Alright! Let’s try something else.
Uh...from the top. Ready? One, two,
three...
INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL BAND ROOM.
JOE GARDNER, a passionate, well-dressed middle-aged man,
conducts an off-key middle school band. It’s painfully bad.
JOE
One, two, three, four! Stay on the
beat! Two, three four--that’s a C
Sharp, horns!
A TROMBONIST loses his trombone end, which lands on the floor
with a CLANK.
A TRUMPETER uses his horn to vacuum up M&Ms from the floor.
CALEB, a saxophonist, pretends to play while actually on his
iPHONE.
JOE
Two, three, I see you, Caleb!
Startled, Caleb tosses the phone into a neighboring student’s
sax.
JOE
(to another student)
Rachel, now you!
But Rachel lies across a few chairs.
RACHEL
Forgot my sax, Mr. G.
JOE
Okay, she forgot her sax! Aaand now- aaaaall you, Connie. Go for it!
Joe then motions to CONNIE, a Chinese American girl holding a
trombone. She’s his last hope.
Connie plays her solo, strong and passionate. Joe smiles.
But some of the other kids start giggling, and Connie’s
confidence (and playing) suddenly wilts.

Way to go!

CALEB

Joe taps his music stand.
JOE
Hang on, hang on. What are y’all
laughing at?
The kids quiet down.
JOE
So Connie got lost in it. That’s a
good thing!
Connie stews in her seat, embarrassed, as Joe addresses the
class.
JOE
Look, I remember one time... my dad
took me to this jazz club, and
that’s the last place that I wanted
to be.
Joe walks to the piano and starts playing while he explains:
JOE
But then I see this guy. And he’s
playing these chords with fourths
on it and then, with the minor.
Whooo! Then he adds the inner
voices, and it’s like he’s... it’s
like he’s singing. And I swear, the
next thing I know... it’s like he
he floats off the stage. That guy
was lost in the music. He was in
it, and he took the rest of us with
him.
Joe finishes with a beautiful, dreamy flourish. The class is
captivated with his music.
JOE
And I wanted to learn how to talk
like that. That’s when I knew. I
was born to play.
(beat)
Connie knows what I mean. Right,
Connie?
CONNIE
I’m twelve.
A KNOCK on the classroom door interrupts.

JOE
I’ll be right back. Practice your
scales.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Joe pops into the hall to speak with PRINCIPAL ARROYO as bad
scales emanate from the classroom behind him.
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Gardner.
JOE
Heh heh, you’re doing my ears a
favor.
A STUDENT exits the class doorway behind Joe:
Hey!

CALEB

JOE
Not you, though. You’re good.
When the student leaves:
JOE
(whispering)
He’s not.
The Principal CHUCKLES.
JOE
What can I do for you, Principal
Arroyo?
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
I wanted to deliver the good news
personally!
She hands Joe a letter:
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
No more part-time for you. You’re
now our full-time band teacher! Job
security. Medical insurance.
Pension.
JOE
Wow. That’s...great.

PRINCIPAL ARROYO
Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe.
Permanently.
Thanks.

JOE

Joe forces a smile.
He reenters the classroom and sadly looks at the wall,
covered with photos of jazz greats.
INT. LIBBA’S TAILOR SHOP.
A busy tailor shop bustling with activity. LIBBA, Joe’s
mother, hems a dress on a CUSTOMER.
Libba’s assistants, MELBA and LULU, work away at sewing
machines.
Joe is folding his laundry, poorly.
LIBBA
After all these years, my prayers
have been answered! A full-time
job!
LULU
Wonderful, wonderful!

MELBA
Workin’ man, comin’ through!

JOE
Yeah. But mom I...
Joe rolls each piece of clothing and places it in the basket.
LIBBA
You’re going to tell them yes,
right?
JOE
Don’t worry Mom, I got a plan.
LIBBA
You always got a plan.
She begins poking the customer with pins as she talks.
Ow!

CUSTOMER

LIBBA
Maybe you need to have a backup
plan too...
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft

Ow-ow!

CUSTOMER

LIBBA
...for when your plan falls
through.
MELBA
A back up plan never hurt.
Mmmhmm.
Hm.

LULU
JOE

LIBBA
Joey. We didn’t struggle giving you
an education so you could be a
middle-aged man washing your
underwear in my shop.
Libba holds up an pair embarrassing underwear from Joe’s
laundry basket.
MELBA
Mm, Mmm, Mmm.

LULU
(at sight of underwear)
walkin’ around with a hole in
his pants...

Lulu grabs the undies and checks them out, shaking her head.
Yeah, but-

JOE

Joe snatches the underwear and throws them back into his
basket.
LIBBA
With this job, you’ll be able to
put that dead-end gigging behind
you. And Lord knows, we need more
teachers in this world. And just
think, playing music will finally
be your real career!
Joe can see this is a losing battle.
LIBBA
So, you’re going to tell them yes,
right?
Joe is about to protest...

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
CUSTOMER
(pleading)
Please, say yes.
...but instead closes his mouth.
JOE
Yeah. Definitely.
Good.

LIBBA

BZZZ! Joe’s phone rings. He fishes it out and answers.
Hello?

JOE

CURLEY (O.S.)
How you been, Mr. G? Uh, It’s
Curley. Lamont, Lamont Baker.
Joe turns away from Libba as she tends to the customer.
JOE
Hey! Curley! Hey, good to hear your
voice, man. Uh listen, you can call
me Joe now, Curley. I’m not your
teacher anymore.
CURLEY (O.S.)
Okay Mr. Gardner. Hey, look, I’m
the new drummer in the Dorothea
Williams Quartet and we’re kicking
off our tour with a show at The
Half Note tonight.
JOE
Dorothea Williams?! Are you kidding
me? Congratulations, man! Wow, I
would die a happy man if I could
perform with Dorothea Williams.
CURLEY (O.S.)
Well, this could be your lucky day!
EXT. NEW YORK STREET. DAY.
Joe SPRINTS DOWN THE STREET, weaving between NEW YORKERS. He
comes up to a brick building -- the renowned HALF NOTE jazz
club.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
INT. HALF NOTE -- ENTRY HALL.
Joe catches his breath as he walks down the stairs. Photos of
jazz greats line the wall. He gazes at them, taking off his
hat in reverence.
Deep in the club we hear a jazz band WARMING UP.
CURLEY BAKER, a burley drummer in his 20s, meets Joe.
CURLEY
Woo, there he is!
JOE
Hey, Curley.
CURLEY
Leon skipping town really put us in
a bind, man.
I’ll bet.

JOE

CURLEY
I’m glad you made it. My boy Bishop
said he sat in on with you on a set
last year in Brooklyn. Said you
were great.
JOE
Well... you know, for a coffee
shop.
They enter the small club -- a low-lit New York treasure
filled with mood and history.
Warming up on stage with her sax is DOROTHEA WILLIAMS, the
regal, no-nonsense leader of the Dorothea Williams Quartet.
Joe looks on in amazement as she plays. It’s effortless and
tight. They respectfully wait for an opening.
CURLEY
Hey Dorothea, this is the cat I was
telling you about. My old middle
school band teacher, Mr. Gardner!
JOE
Call me Joe, Dorothea. I mean,
um... Ms. Williams. It’s a
pleasure. Wow. This is amazing.
She’s not impressed.

©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

7.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
CURLEY
Joe is Ray Gardner’s son.
Still not impressed.
DOROTHEA
So we’re down to middle school band
teachers now.
Joe doesn’t know what to say. Finally, Dorothea rises from
her chair.
DOROTHEA (CONT’D)
Get on up here, Teach. We ain’t got
all day.
Joe barely sits down at the piano when Dorothea starts
playing.
The bassist, MIHO AKAGI, and drummer (Curley) join without
missing a beat.
JOE
(confused)
What...what are we playing--?
Dorothea doesn’t answer.
Joe misses a few beats but jumps into the music, trying to
keep up and figure out where the music is going.
He finally eases into the tune when Dorothea stops playing
and points to him -- a signal for Joe to solo. She looks off
stage and listens.
Joe takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates on
the keys.
The music flows into an incredible solo. The room slips away
as Joe goes into the zone, a place we’ll come to know as the
Astral Plane.
He finally comes out of his trance, and looks up to see the
band has stopped playing. Everyone is staring at him.
JOE
Uh, sorry. I zoned out a little
back there. Heh.
Joe thinks he’s doomed. Dorothea just stares. Finally:
DOROTHEA
Joe Gardner, where have you been?

JOE
I’ve been uh...teaching...middle
school band, but on weekends I-DOROTHEA
You got a suit?
I...!

JOE

DOROTHEA
Get a suit, Teach. A good suit.
Back here tonight. First show’s at
9. Soundcheck’s at 7. We’ll see how
you do.
She walks offstage.
EXT. THE HALF NOTE.
Joe explodes out of the club.
JOE
YES! WHOO HOO!
(at the sky)
You see that, Dad! That’s what I’m
talking about!
A MAN passes by with a stroller. Joe runs up to him, pointing
up at the Half Note marquee.
JOE
Look up, look up! You know what
that’s gonna say? Joe Gardner! HA
HA!
Joe dances around him and heads down the street.
CUT TO:
Joe turns the corner, still on his cell phone:
JOE
You’re never gonna believe what
just happened! I did it. I got the
gig! Yes!
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS.
Joe is on his phone, spreading the good news, oblivious to
the city around him.

JOE
I know! I know! Dorothea Williams!
Can you believe it!?
CUT TO:
CONSTRUCTION SITE.
Joe walks right under a huge pallet of bricks as it’s lifted
into the air. A bunch of bricks fall, just missing him.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Hey, pal! You’re gonna get hurt!
But Joe doesn’t hear her.
CUT TO:
BUSY INTERSECTION.
Joe absently steps into traffic.
JOE
Just don’t tell my mom about this,
okay?
A huge bus misses him by inches. He doesn’t notice.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE VARIOUS STOREFRONTS.
Still oblivious, Joe walks through a sidewalk littered with
split banana peels, then through a pile of overturned nails.
Amazingly, he avoids disaster while on his phone:
JOE
Forget class. I’m in a different
class. I’m in a Dorothea Williams
class buddy. You know what I’m
saying?
CUT TO:
STREET CORNER.
Joe turns a corner, phone still to his ear. He nearly runs
into an old man with an ANGRY DOG. The dog lunges at Joe,
BARKING:
JOE
Whoa, whoa, sorry!

©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
Joe turns on his heel to avoid the dog. He starts walking
into the middle of the street. A motorcycle narrowly misses
him. WHEW! That was close. Confident he missed death, he
takes a step forward... and falls right into a manhole.
AAHHHHH!

JOE

EXT. LIMBO -- SLIDEWALK.
OOF! Joe lands with a THUD on a moving slidewalk, akin to
those in airports.
He’s now a LUMINOUS SOUL.
Joe looks into the darkness, then notices his hands and feet
are different, glowing.
JOE
What the--?
He looks around, confused.
JOE
Hello? Hello!
He looks to where the slidewalk is headed: A GIANT WHITE
LIGHT in the near distance -- THE GREAT BEYOND!
JOE
What the--?
He turns and walks the other way.
But the sliding walkway counteracts Joe, causing him to walk
in place. He looks behind him.
The Great Beyond is still there.
Joe GASPS, turns and runs.
JOE
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
In the distance he sees three figures standing on the
slidewalk. Joe runs to them.
Hello!

JOE

GEREL
Oh, what’s your name, honey?

©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

11.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
JOE
I’m Joe. Joe Gardner. Look, I’m not
supposed to be here!
The others look at each other.
GEREL
Ah, it must have been sudden for
you.
(approaching Joe)
You see Joe, I’m 106 years old.
Been waiting a long time for this.
For what?

JOE

She points ahead.
GEREL
The Great Beyond.
JOE
The Great Beyond!? As in, as in
beyond... life!?
Yeah.

AMIR

JOE
That’s DEATH right there!
MIALI
(subtitled)
This beats my dream about the
walrus.
GEREL
Exciting, isn’t it!?
JOE
No! No, no, no! Listen, I have a
gig tonight! I can’t die now!
AMIR
Well, I really don’t think you have
a lot to say about this.
JOE
Yes! Yes, I do. I’m not dying the
VERY day I got my shot. I’m due!
Heck, I’m OVER-due! Nah ah. I’m
outta here.
Joe walks away from them.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
GEREL
I don’t think you’re supposed to go
that way.
But Joe keeps walking, against the slidewalk’s flow.
JOE
(to himself)
This can’t happen. I’m NOT dying
today. Not when my life just
started!
He turns to see where the three other souls went.
The slidewalk climbs up into the distance, into the white maw
of the Great Beyond. The trio of souls ascend into it, then
disappear with a crackle -- FLZZZT!
Joe freaks:
JOE
What was that! Wait!
He bolts, running desperately against the slidewalk’s flow.
JOE
I’m not finished! I GOTTA GET BACK!
I DON’T WANNA DIE!!! I’M NOT DONE!
I’M NOT DONE!
He comes to another soul, WINSTON, strangely disinterested.
JOE
RUN!!! WHY AREN’T YOU RUNNING??
WINSTON
Idonknow...
JOE
What is wrong with you people?!
WINSTON
(shrugs)
Idonknow...
Joe keeps running. He passes another soul, JANG-MI:
JANG-MI
(in Korean)
Where are my pants?
Joe runs into a crowd of souls. Some are blissfully aware and
unaware, some freaking out in their own way, and in other
languages.
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

13.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
JOE
I’M NOT DONE!
Panicked, Joe tries PUSHING through them.
JOE
Ahh!! Oh my goodness, oh my
goodness. Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me!
Help! I’m not done! I gotta get
back!
Finally, Joe jumps onto their heads and runs. But the Great
Beyond grows even closer. Finally he tries launching himself
off the slidewalk completely. But he SMACKS against a
cellophane-like barrier.
Just in front, souls are being zapped into the Great Beyond
by the handfuls. It’s nearly his turn!
Joe CLAWS at the barrier, screaming, desperate!
Finally he RIPS through it and falls...
EXT. THE GREAT BEFORE.
A portal opens, dropping Joe in what appears to be tall
grass. He watches as the portal closes above him.
He slowly gets up and looks around another world. Beautiful
buildings, Elysian fields and glowing crowds of strange,
fuzzy beings -- NEW SOULS.
A rambunctious group of them are gathered around a COUNSELOR,
a taller, ethereal being that looks vaguely human.
The Counselor spots Joe. He quickly ducks down.
But too late.
One of the new souls finds him and pokes his face, laughing.
Joe pushes it away, but other new souls arrive, surrounding
him. One BITES him.
Ow!

JOE

The Counselor, JERRY, appears as the new souls toss Joe into
the air happily.
COUNSELOR JERRY
Now, now, everyone let’s give the
Mentor some room.
(MORE)

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
COUNSELOR JERRY
(to Joe)
Sorry -- new souls.

15.
(CONT'D)

But the souls continue to crowd Joe. One pulls at his mouth.
COUNSELOR JERRY
37, that’s enough. Hey everyone,
look here! Quiet coyote! Shh! Quiet
coyote!
Like a kindergarten teacher, Counselor Jerry holds up two
fingers. Immediately the other souls mimic her and quiet
down.
JOE
Who are you?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
I am the coming together of all
quantized fields of the universe,
appearing in a form your feeble
human brain can comprehend.
Wha?

JOE

COUNSELOR JERRY A
You can call me Jerry.
JOE
Jerry. Okay. Hey, is this heaven?
Ha ha, no!

COUNSELOR JERRY A

JOE
(cautious)
Is it... H-E-double hockey sticks?
A new soul pops up over Joe’s shoulder.
Hell!

NEW SOUL

NEW SOULS
Hell! Hell! Hell!
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Shhh. Quiet coyote!
(to Joe)
It’s easy to get turned around.
This isn’t the Great Beyond. It’s
the Great Before!

©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
JOE
The Great Before?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Oh, we call it the You Seminar now.
Rebranding.
Joe takes in the odd surroundings, filled with playful new
souls.
JOE
Does this mean I’m... dead?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Not yet. Your body’s in a holding
pattern. It’s complicated. I’ll get
you back to your group.
Jerry mutates into a bizarre, four-legged bus. The Counselor
scoops up Joe with a giant hand, setting him in a chair on
top.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Come on, little souls! Get on up
here!
The Counselor gathers the other souls and carries them
through the strange campus. The impressionable new souls are
still infatuated with Joe even as he tries to process his
surroundings.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Welcome to the You Seminar! You are
in for a treat!
EXT. LIMBO -- ABOVE THE SLIDEWALK.
Meanwhile, a pair of Counselors are watching the deceased
souls pour from the slidewalk into The Great Beyond.
While one Counselor is another Jerry, the other is shorter,
angrier, and holds a huge ABACUS. The Counselor uses it with
lightening precision to count every soul that enters the
white light. This is TERRY, the accountant.
Suddenly, Terry stops counting.
TERRY
Hmm. That’s weird.
COUNSELOR JERRY E
What is it?

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
TERRY
The count’s off.
Excuse me?

COUNSELOR JERRY E

TERRY
There's a soul missing. The count’s
OFF.
Huh.

COUNSELOR JERRY E

EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Jerry (in bus form) continues to walk Joe and the new souls
across campus.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Okay, first stop is the Excitable
Pavilion. You four. In you go!
The new souls zoom into a glistening Personality Pavilion.
They emerge from the other side, now excited.
Woohooo!

NEW SOULS

COUNSELOR JERRY A
You five, you’ll be aloof. And you
two, why not.
The new souls enter another pavilion, emerging aloof.
JOE
W-wait a minute. This is where
personalities come from?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Of course! Do you think people are
just born with them?
JOE
So uh... how do they get to Earth
then?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Well, they use the Earth Portal.
Jerry points. In the distance Joe sees a large, circular hole
in the ground. Through it, Earth beckons!
At the portal’s edge new souls jump to Earth.
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

17.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Once they get a complete
personality of course...
But Joe is gone.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Hello? Hello?
ELSEWHERE -- Joe sprints towards the portal. All around him
new souls jump to Earth below as Mentors cheer them on.
MENTORS
Congratulations! You’re going to
have a great life!
Joe JUMPS! He free-falls along with several new souls toward
the beautiful globe below, LAUGHING and CHEERING at the
thrill ride.
But as the new souls continue down towards the Earth and
disappear, Joe bounces off a weird, invisible barrier. He
careens through space and is delivered right back to the You
Seminar.
Joe tries to jump again. And again! Frustrated, he grabs a
new soul and jumps with them, hoping to sneak into Earth
behind it. But Joe is again spit back into the You Seminar.
Finally, he just stares down at the Earth, frustrated.
Counselor Jerry finds him.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
You sure get lost a lot!
EXT. MENTOR ORIENTATION TABLE.
Jerry brings Joe to where a group of older souls like him are
gathered around a table, looking for their pre-printed name
tag. These are MENTORS.
Another Counselor Jerry gives instructions:
COUNSELOR JERRY D
All righty, mentors. Just find your
name here...
The Counselor ushering Joe steps forward.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Hello Jerry! Got a lost mentor for
you.

18.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
COUNSELOR JERRY D
Thanks, Jerry.
JOE
Uh look, I’m not sure I’m supposed
to be here.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
I understand. Mentoring isn’t for
everyone. You’re more than welcome
to opt out.
The Counselor opens a portal straight to The Great Beyond!
JOE
Ah! Actually, on second thought,
you know, the mentoring sounds like
fun.
Joe quickly grabs any name tag from the table and follows the
group.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
I'm glad to hear it. Jerry will
take it from here.
COUNSELOR JERRY D
Thanks, Jerry.
(to Joe)
Head right on over there to Jerry.
The Counselor points to another Jerry, this one in the form
of a large theater.
COUNSELOR JERRY F
Thank you, Jerry.
JOE
Is everyone here named Jerry?
The first Counselor watches Joe leave.
Good luck!

COUNSELOR JERRY A

Terry the Accountant appears out of a portal.
TERRY
Jerry, we’ve got a problem!
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Oh hello there, Terry.

19.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
TERRY
The count’s off!
COUNSELOR JERRY A
(chuckling)
I seriously doubt that. The count
hasn’t been off in centuries.
Terry produces the large abacus, using it to make her point:
TERRY
151,000 souls go into the Great
Beyond every day. That’s 105.2
souls per minute, Jerry. 1.75 souls
per second. And I count every
single one of ‘em.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Yep. I’m aware.
TERRY
It’s my job to keep track of this
stuff, Jerry. I’m the accountant.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
And we all think you’re doing a
wonderful job, don’t we everyone?
The other Counselors somewhat agree.
TERRY
I’m always counting. I’m counting
right now. You blinked five times
since I started talking.
(the Counselor blinks)
Six.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Right! Since accounting is your
job, why don’t you figure out the
problem.
TERRY
Maybe I will.
Wonderful!

COUNSELOR JERRY A

The Counselor vanishes. Terry angrily stalks off to:

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
INT. THE HALL OF RECORDS.
Terry arrives in the Hall of Records. She’s greeted by
another Jerry.
COUNSELOR JERRY
Hello again, Terry!
TERRY
Don't play dumb with me.
IN A LARGE FILE ROOM -Terry opens the first file cabinet, cracks her fingers and
gets ready.
TERRY
Okay. Here we go. “A.”
Terry flips through the files, her fingers almost moving too
fast for the eye to see. At this rate, it seems like it won’t
take her very long.
However, an epic PULL OUT reveals that the file cabinets
stretch on endlessly, vanishing into the horizon. This is
going to take a while.
INT. MENTOR ORIENTATION THEATER.
Joe steps into the theater as an instructional video begins.
Other Mentors watch from stadium seats.
ON THE SCREEN -In a scratchy, well-worn corporate video, a Counselor
explains:
COUNSELOR JERRY C
Hello there, Mentors! I’m Jerry, a
Counselor here at the You Seminar.
You don’t remember it, but you’ve
been here before! But don’t worry,
forgetting the trauma of childbirth
is one of the great gifts of the
universe.
Joe finds a seat and watches:
COUNSELOR JERRY C
Here at the You Seminar, all new
souls are given unique and
individual personalities.

22.

NEW SOULS testify to the camera, while holding up their
Personality Profiles - a badge filled with circular icons
identifying which Personality Pavilions they’ve visited.
On each badge one circle is still empty.
NEW SOUL 1
I’m an agreeable skeptic who’s
cautious yet flamboyant.
NEW SOUL 2
I’m an irritable wall flower who’s
dangerously curious.
NEW SOUL 3
I’m a manipulative megalomaniac
who’s intensely opportunistic.
COUNSELOR JERRY
Oh ho! This one might be a handful!
But that’s Earth’s problem.
Joe takes this all in.
COUNSELOR JERRY
You’ll notice these souls are all
missing something.
The Counselor points to the last empty circle on a soul’s
unfinished badge.
COUNSELOR JERRY
What goes in this spot? Well, these
souls need their Spark. And that’s
where YOU come in!
CUT TO:
THE HALL OF EVERYTHING.
The video continues by showcasing an immense space filled
with everything on Earth.
COUNSELOR JERRY (O.S.)
Maybe you will find their Spark in
the Hall of Everything, where
literally anything on Earth could
inspire!
We see a NEW SOUL shoot an arrow from a bow and become
inspired. Their last box fills in with their Spark and the
badge turns into an Earth Pass.

THE HALL OF YOU.
A MENTOR ushers a NEW SOUL around a museum featuring moments
from the mentor’s extraordinary life.
COUNSELOR JERRY (O.S.)
Or perhaps you’ll prefer the “Hall
of You,” featuring a selection of
moments from your own inspiring
life!
The new soul’s badge becomes an Earth Pass.
CUT TO:
BACK IN THE THEATER:
Joe’s eyes go wide as he gets an idea.
COUNSELOR JERRY
And just what is this Spark? Well
as mentors, you’ve already learned
that...
But Joe isn’t listening. Instead, he imagines his plan:
CUT TO:
JOE’S DAYDREAM.
In the HALL OF EVERYTHING, Joe plays a lively tune on a piano
for a new soul. In no time, the soul is inspired and its
badge turns into an Earth Pass! Joe smiles, not surprised.
Without a thought, Joe YANKS the Earth Pass away, tosses the
new soul into the piano, and jumps straight to Earth.
BACK IN NEW YORK, he lands back in his stricken body. It
jolts back to life. Joe launches out of the manhole, runs
straight to his performance with Dorothea Williams, and
receives the applause of the entire city.
BACK IN THE THEATER:
As the video ends, Joe smiles assuredly.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
I know you’re all excited to get to
work, so good luck finding the
Spark!

JOE
(to himself)
Find the Spark!
The lights come on. Another Counselor steps onto the stage.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Wow, that was informative. Now it’s
time for my favorite part of the
program: matching you Mentors with
your Soul Mates!
A group of giggling NEW SOULS make their way towards the
stage as the Counselor looks into the audience of Mentors.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Our first Mentor is Maria Martinez!
Maria, come on down!
Polite applause as MARIA steps on stage.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Maria was a rare disease specialist
from the University of Mexico.
ON THE SCREEN -In a DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- The human form of DR. mARIA mARTINEZ
successfully treats a PATIENT.
I'm cured!

PATIENT

The other Mentors APPLAUD, impressed.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
She’ll be matched with, one of my
favorites, soul number 108 billion,
210 million, 121 thousand, four
hundred and 15.
The adorable and cute NEW SOUL steps on stage. The new soul
and Maria embrace, giggle, and walk off hand in hand.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Congratulations! Off you go! Our
next mentor is Bjorn T. Börgensson!
Immediate APPLAUSE. Everyone looks at Joe. He’s confused,
until he reads his name tag: Dr. Börgensson. Joe rushes up on
stage.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Dr. Börgensson is a world renown
child psychologist who was recently
awarded a Nobel Prize!
ON THE SCREEN -In a PYSCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE, GRETA, a troubled teenager, looks
at a Rorschach blot held up by a very different looking DR.
BÖRGENSSON.
GRETA
I see pain, death, destruction!
DR. BÖRGENSSON
Hmmm. How about now?
He flips it the other way.
GRETA
A pretty butterfly.
The audience of Mentors are extremely impressed. Joe forces a
smile.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Dr. Börgensson will be matched with
soul number...22!
A spotlight shines on an empty spot.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
(annoyed)
Oh we’re gonna get into this now.
Excuse me.
Impossibly, the Counselor descends into the floor, into
another dimension. As Joe watches the empty stage he hears:
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
22, you come out of this dimension
right now!
22 (O.S.)
How many times do I have to tell
you, I don’t wanna go to Earth!
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
Stop fighting this, 22. You will go
to Earth and have a life!
Make me!

OFF-SCREEN we hear the sounds of RUNNING and GRABBING.
Something BREAKS.
Finally, Jerry’s upper half emerges from the other dimension,
wrestling with a soul who doesn’t want to come out.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
22 has been at the You Seminar for
quite some time and has had such
notable mentors as Gandhi, Abraham
Lincoln and Mother Theresa.
Finally, Jerry yanks 22 out of the dimension. 22 struggles in
the Counselor’s arms like a wildcat.
22
HA HA! I made her cry!
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Ignore that.
22
Put me down! Hey! Quit it!
COUNSELOR JERRY B
We’re TRULY glad to have you here,
Dr. Börgensson. It is an honor
having you prepare 22 for Earth.
The Counselor struggles to hold 22 who melts in his arms like
a belligerent toddler. 22 glares at Joe:
22
I’m gonna make you wish you’d never
died.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Most people wish that, 22.
The Counselor “drapes” 22 over Joe. Before he can protest,
the Counselor opens a portal and quickly pushes them out.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Off you go! Bye! Bye!

Joe tosses 22 off.

Joe gawks at the room they are now in -- it’s the Hall of Dr.
Börgensson!
The museum-like displays are filled with pop-up moments of
Dr. Börgensson’s illustrious life. Glass-encased exhibits
hold artifacts and awards while holograms recreating his
greatest successes play on an endless loop.
22
Okay, look I’m sure your life was amayzing and you did a-mayzing
things but here’s what we’re gonna
do. We’re gonna stand in here in
silence for a little bit, then we
go back out, you say you tried, I
go back to not-living my non-life
and you go to the Great Beyond.
No, look-

CUT TO:
BACK IN THE HALL OF DR. BÖRGENSSON -- 22 continues, to Joe:
22
Thanks but no thanks, Doc. I
already know everything about
Earth, and it’s not worth the
trouble.
JOE
Come on, don’t you want to fill out
your pass?
22
Ehh, you know, I’m comfortable up
here. I have my routine. I float in
mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles, and
then, like, once a week, they make
me come to one of these You
Seminars. It’s not great but I know
what to expect.
JOE
Look kid. Can I just be honest with
you? I’m not Bjorn Borgenstein or
whatever his name is. I’m not even
a mentor.
22
Not a mentor? Ah, ha ha! Reverse

SOUL CARL JUNG
Stop talking! My unconscious mind
hates you!
CUT TO:
BACK IN THE HALL OF DR. BÖRGENSSON -JOE
Is there any way to show a
different life in this place?
A look of suspicion comes over 22’s face. 22 brings up a
control panel from the ground, takes Joe’s hand, and places
it flat onto a scanner.
All around them, the Dr. Börgensson exhibits vanish.
After a flourish of light and sound, 22 and Joe find
themselves standing in THE HALL OF JOE. It dawns on 22:
22
Wait, you’re really not Bjorn
Börgensson?
Joe looks around at the space. Dr. Börgensson’s awards,
citations, and victorious moments have all been replaced with
elements of Joe’s life.
JOE
It’s... my life!
The museum displays are comprised of much less inspiring,
more underwhelming exhibits.
22
...umm excuse me. What’s going on
here?
22 points to a display of Binaca Breath Spray and a bottle of
cheap Drakkar Noir cologne.
22
Binaca breath spray? Cheap cologne?
JOE
Man, who curated this exhibit?
22
Heh. YOU did.
22 walks over to a PHOTO of a TEENAGE JOE, awkwardly standing
behind a keyboard, next to a much hipper THREE-MAN HIP HOP
GROUP.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
22
Hahahahahahah!
Joe is mortified.
JOE
Oh my goodness, it’s Cedric’s rap
group. Noooo!
Joe pulls 22 away.
JOE
No, don’t look at that stuff, let’s
look over here!
Joe leads 22 to a HOLOGRAM -- a YOUNG JOE is being dragged
into the HALF NOTE JAZZ CLUB by his dad, RAY GARDNER.
YOUNG JOE
Dad, I don’t wanna go! I don’t like
jazz!
RAY
Black improvisational music. It's
one of our great contributions to
American culture. At least give it
a chance, Joey!
Joe and 22 watch as Ray brings Young Joe into the club, where
a PIANIST is jamming with his BAND. Young Joe locks in on the
pianist as Joe explains to 22:
JOE
This is where it all started. This
is the moment where I fell in love
with jazz.
We see Young Joe enthralled by the pianist’s playing.
JOE
Listen to that! See the tune is
just the starting point, y’get me?
The music is just an excuse to
bring out the YOU.
Joe leads 22 through more of his life.
JOE
THAT’s why I became a jazz
musician!
But they walk up to a HOLOGRAM of Joe auditioning for an
unimpressed CLUB OWNER.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
CLUB OWNER 1
It's not what we're looking for.
Confused, Joe walks away as 22 trails him.
JOE
Wait. That’s not how I remember it
going down. I mean I...
But they come across more rejection holograms from other CLUB
OWNERS:
CLUB OWNER 2
Come back when you have something.
CLUB OWNER 3
Sorry, Joe.
CLUB OWNER 4
We’re looking for something
different.
They keep walking through Joe’s life, past holograms of Joe
teaching middle school kids, sitting alone in a diner,
waiting for a subway.
A pathetic monument depicts him washing clothes at the
laundromat. Joe is stunned.
JOE
My life was meaningless.
Finally, they come to a hologram of Joe in a hospital bed,
unconscious after the fall. This is the current state of his
body -- still alive, but soulless. It’s a sad end to what
appears to be a depressing life.
But as Joe regards this, he becomes determined:
JOE
No. No no no! I will not accept
this!
(to 22)
Kid, give me that badge. I’m going
back to my body.
22
Oh yeah. Sure. Here.
22 removes the badge and hands it to Joe. But it vanishes and
returns onto 22.
The soul removes it again and tosses it into the distance.
Again, it returns.

22 shreds it into pieces, even lights it on fire. But it
always materializes back onto the soul.
22
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass,
I’m stuck with it.
JOE
Well what if I help you turn that
into an Earth Pass? Will you give
it to me then?
22
Wait! I’ve never thought of that!
I’d get to skip life. So yes! But
we’ve gotta get this thing to
change first, and I’ve never been
able to get it to change.
JOE
Come on! I know all about Sparks,
because mine is piano!
22 follows Joe through the Hall. They find what he’s looking
for: a HOLOGRAM of Joe’s playing piano for Dorothea Williams - the moment that was supposed to change his life.
Joe looks at 22’s badge, assured it will work. But still no
Spark, the circle remains empty.
JOE
Really? Nothing at all?
22
Meh. It’s just... music. I don’t
like music sounds. It feels like a
little too much.
JOE
Well I am not going out like this.
Where’s that Hall of Everything?
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
The HALL OF EVERYTHING looms in the distance. Joe and 22 walk
toward it, passing the Earth Portal. Joe leans to Earth:
JOE
I’ll be right back.
22
Don’t get ahead of yourself, pal.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
JOE
By the way, why do you sound like a
middle aged white lady?
22
I don’t. This is all an illusion.
Huh?

JOE

22
This whole place is a hypothetical.
22’s voice changes:
OLD MAN
I could sound like THIS if I wanted
to...
YOUNG GIRL
Or sound like THIS instead.
22
I could even sound like YOU.
22 changes into an exact replica of Joe:
22
(in Joe’s voice)
Life is so unfair! I don’t wanna
die! Somebody call the wahhhhhhmbulance! Wahhhhh!
22 switches back:
22
I just use this voice because it
annoys people.
JOE
It’s very effective.
A ball of new souls rolls past and smacks into a pavilion,
which tips over and CRASHES on top of them.
22
Don’t worry, they’re fine. You
can’t crush a soul here. That’s
what life on Earth is for.
Joe shoots her a look.
JOE
Mm hm. Very witty.

INT. HALL OF EVERYTHING
The Hall is gigantic. Everything on Earth is in here!
22
Ok. Here we are. This is the Hall
of Everything.
Amazed, Joe looks around at all of the activity.
New souls are everywhere trying out different tasks from
fishing to soccer to photography to basketball. We see some
badges turn into Earth Passes.
A SOCCER BALL rolls up to Joe’s feet. He kicks it, and it
flies over to a new soul standing next to its Mentor. The
ball hits it’s head and the new soul’s badge changes to an
Earth Pass.
22
So where do you wanna start?
Joe looks around the enormous room, filled with literally
everything on Earth.
He grabs 22 and pulls the soul towards a French bakery.
Come on!

JOE

INT. FRENCH BAKERY.
Joe and 22 tour the aisles, loaded with every sort of
delicious, baked item imaginable.
JOE
Croissants, cakes!
Joe pulls out a steamy slice of pizza.
JOE
Baking could be your Spark!
22
Yeah! But um, I don’t get it.
JOE
Just smell it!
22
Can’t. And neither can you.

You’re right, I can’t smell-Joe eats the pizza, but it comes out his bottom end, still
fully formed.
JOE
We can’t taste, either!?
22
All that stuff is in your body.
22 eats a whole slice of pizza. It comes out the other end,
still perfect.
JOE
No smell, no taste.
Or touch.

22

22 slaps him.
See?

22

22 slaps him a second time. And a third. And a fourth, etc.
Finally, Joe stops it.
JOE
Okay, I get it! Moving on.

22 tries putting out a burning building as a fire fighter.

Joe and 22 step onto the Astral Plane. Joe looks around at
the bizarre, amazing landscape.
The glitter-like dust below their feet rises and lowers
gently, like waves on an ocean.
Suspended above them are countless SOULS engrossed in tasks
like playing an instrument, writing, swimming, etc. All are
in the zone.
Joe is in awe.

twirls around the beast, bringing it to the ground.
Joe and 22 stand frozen, unsure what to make of this.

floor. Through it they see the Hedge Fund Manager’s human

BACK TO SCENE:
Seeing this excites Joe:
JOE
He got back just like that!?
Joe grabs the walking stick from Dreamerwind and draws
another circle.
JOE
So this is all I have to do to get
back to my body?
But instead of his human body, the Great Beyond appears!
AAAHHH!

JOE

MOONWIND
Ahh! Egads, man!
Moonwind quickly cover up the hole.
MOONWIND
Joe! Are you...dead!?
JOE
No! No, no. Well, not yet. Can you
help me get back?
MOONWIND
We’ve never connected an untethered
soul back to its body before. But
perhaps if we travel to a thin
spot... Yes! All aboard!
He leads them up the gangplank.
MOONWIND
Anchors away!

JOE
So, if your souls are here, where
are your bodies?
MOONWIND
Well, on Earth of course!
WINDSTAR
My body is in a trance in Palawan.
DANCERSTAR
I’m playing the saraswati veena in
Tibet.
DREAMERWIND
I’m a shamanic healer meditating in
Berkeley, California.
JOE
(to Moonwind)
Mmhmm. Lemme guess, you’re
drumming, chanting, and meditating?
MOONWIND
Yes... something like that.
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK STREET CORNER.
Moonwind’s human body expertly spins a “HOT DEALS” sign on a
street corner.

I’m not stuck with a body, so I can
go whereeeever I want. I’m a Nobody. Get it?
MOONWIND
We Mystics meet in this glorious
landscape every Tuesday.
They sail past high mountains, deep valleys, and HERDS OF
LOST SOULS. Joe looks down at them.
JOE
So many of them. Sad.
MOONWIND
Lost Souls are not that different
from those in the zone.
Moonwind points at the souls floating above them.
What?

JOE

We see a floating SOUL WITH A METAL DETECTOR, obsessed in the
hunt.
METAL DETECTOR SOUL
(muttering)
Gottafindit, gottafindit,
gottafindit, gottafindit...
MOONWIND
The zone is enjoyable, but when
that joy becomes an obsession, one
become disconnected from life.
They watch as the soul becomes ENCASED IN ASTRAL DUST,
transforming into a Lost Soul. It’s muttering becomes garbled
and scary.
MOONWIND
For a time I was a Lost Soul
myself.
Really?

EXT. ASTRAL PLANE -- THIN SPOT.
The ship sails into a sunken spot on the Astral Plane and
drops anchor.
MOONWIND
There you are! We’ll have you back
in no time.
Everyone walks down the gangplank onto the astral sand.
MOONWIND
Now, since you don’t have a
connection to your body, you will
have to tune back into your
physical surroundings.
Moonwind uses the walking stick to draw a large circle in the
dust. Dreamerwind hands 22 a tambourine and they start
playing various instruments as Moonwind kneels down next to
Joe.
MOONWIND
Close your eyes. Breathe into your
crown chakra.
Joe tries to focus, but can’t concentrate with the bad music.
JOE
Do we really need all this?
Yes!

MOONWIND

JOE
Do you have a piano on board? I
could focus with that!
MOONWIND
No pianos, Joe! You must focus!
(beat)
Imagine silence...
(beat)
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....
Joe rolls his eyes and gives in.
MOONWIND
Now concentrate on where your body
is. Listen for cues.
Joe concentrates. The dust in the circle swirls away,
revealing an overhead panorama of New York.

MOONWIND
That's it! You’re doing it!
Joe peeks. The overhead view begins to fall away. Moonwind
quickly covers Joe’s eyes:
MOONWIND
No peeking! Maintain your
meditative state or you’ll break
the connection. Now, see if you can
smell and feel where your body is!
Joe focuses again. We hear the BEEPING OF A HEART MONITOR.
JOE
I hear...a heart monitor. I can
smell... hand sanitizer!
MOONWIND
Yes! Yes! Good!
JOE
I think I can feel my feet!
(beat)
Hmm. I feel fur...?
CUT TO:

Joe’s body lies in bed. His toes wiggle. His hand is on a

But the portal begins to drop away.
MOONWIND
No! No! Joe! Don’t rush this! It’s
not the right time!
JOE
No! It’s my time!
Moonwind tries to stop Joe, but Joe runs forward. In his

22 and Joe disappear through the portal as astral dust swirls
back up, covering it. Moonwind and the others stare at the
thin spot.
Then Moonwind turns and walks away, whistling.
INT. HOSPITAL -- JOE’S ROOM.
POV from Joe, as he opens his eyes and looks around the
hospital room.
JOE
I did it. I’m back. I’m back! HA
HA!
But he looks to see his own body in front of him, lying in
the hospital bed.
He looks at his hands. They are cat paws.
JOE
What the--? No! No! No! NO! I’m in
the cat? Wait a minute! If I’m in

Joe’s body wakes up, sounding like 22:
22

JOE
You’re in my body! No no no!

You’re in the cat!?
JOE
That’s MY body!

DOCTOR
Tell you what, we’re going to keep

a bit. Perhaps our therapy cat can
go to his next appointment-The Doctor starts to pick up Joe. But he HISSES at her. The
Doctor pulls back.

DOCTOR
Uhhh, keep the cat. Just get some
rest. A lot of it, okay?
As the leave, the Therapy Cat Lady says:
CAT LADY
I’ll come get Mr. Mittens in ten
minutes.
22 and Joe are now alone.
JOE
Ten minutes! We gotta get outta

22
No way! I am NOT moving! I can’t

Joe SLAPS 22’s face with his paws.
JOE
Hey! Focus! Listen to me! We gotta

22
Take you away? You’re gonna leave

JOE
No way. That’s my body you’re in!

JOE
Okay. Gotta find Moonwind. He can
fix this.
Joe gets up on his feet, looks down at the floor. It seems
like a long way down.
JOE (CONT’D)
I’m a cat. I can make this.
He jumps, belly-flopping on the linoleum.
INT. HOSPITAL -- HALLWAY.
Joe peeks out from the door and down the hall. The coast is
clear. He stumbles into the hall, struggling to control his
new cat body.
JOE
Okay come on. You’re doing great.
Keep going. Keep going.
22 staggers after him, doing even worse in Joe’s body. The
two fumble and lurch, banging into everything.
JOE
Come on! They’ll be back any
minute!
They finally turn a corner. Joe sees the elevator. But the
Doctor approaches, looking at a file, unaware. Before she
sees them, Joe pushes 22 into another room.
JOE
(whispers)
In here!
The Doctor passes by outside, oblivious.
They rush out and head towards the elevator.
JOE
Now push the down button.
22 tries, but lacks fine motor control, pressing everything
but the elevator call button.
JOE
Careful! Those fingers are my
livelihood!
Frustrated, Joe jumps into her arms and pushes the elevator
button. The doors open.

JOE
Now get in.
The rush in.
INT. HOSPITAL -- ELEVATOR.
The two collapse in the elevator. 22 inspects Joe’s glasses,
causing a bright spot on the floor. Joe can’t stop his cat
instincts and tries to pounce on it. He catches himself and
sits back down.
JOE
Okay. What’d Moonwind say? Corner
of 14th and 7th?
22
Yeah, that’s Chelsea. Near Jackson
Square Park.
JOE
Exactly. Wait. How do you know all
that?
22
It’s all in this stupid brain of
yours.
JOE
Hey! Stay out of there!
22
Oh, relax, there’s not much here.
Jazz, jazz, jazz, more jazz. Oh and
someone named Lisa. Who’s that?
JOE
Never mind!
EXT. HOSPITAL -- LOBBY.
22 holds Joe as they emerge from the elevator and into the
lobby. They walk toward the frosted glass EXIT doors.
22 stands in front of the doors. They can hear the MUFFLED
SOUNDS of the busy city behind them. 22 tries to gather
courage.
22

The doors open and 22 steps out into:
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS. DAY.
The CACOPHONY of New York is overwhelming to 22 -- a barrage
of sight and sound. 22 freezes in fear, but is swept up in a
passing CROWD OF PEOPLE.
Ahh!

22

JOE
Don’t worry, it’s okay. Just keep
walking.
But it’s too much -- A JACKHAMMER! A POLICE WHISTLE! A FIRE
TRUCK!
22 panics and freezes.
JOE
No no! Don’t stop! What are you
doing!? This is New York City! You
don’t stop in the middle of the
street. Go GO GO!!!
Insistent, Joe inadvertently SCRATCHES 22.
AAHHHHHH!

22

22 drops Joe and runs across the street! Joe rushes after
her, nearly getting hit by traffic. But 22 is gone.
JOE
Oh no. 22! 22!
He runs up and down the block, panicking.
JOE
22!!! Oh no! Oh no! 22! 22!

Joe finally finds 22 hiding in the corner of a sub-level
stoop.

But 22 is overwhelmed.
22
Mm mm. No way. I am staying right
here until your stupid body dies!
Which will happen any minute now,
because your stomach is
earthquaking.
Joe is confused for a beat, then understands. He gets an
idea.
INT. PIZZERIA.
Steaming slices of pizza sit under heat lamps. A cat paw
grabs one.
EXT. NEW YORK -- SIDEWALK. DAY.
Joe carries the slice. He passes a RAT walking in the
opposite direction, also carrying its own slice of pizza.
They both stop, regard one another, shrug, then continue on.
EXT. NEW YORK -- DOOR STOOP. DAY.
22 watches Joe approach with the slice.
22
This place is worse than I thought.
It's loud and bright and-(sniff sniff)
What is that in my nose?
JOE
That’s smell.
22’s eyes widen slightly.
JOE
And if you think that’s good, just
imagine what it tastes like.
He walks forward to give it to 22.
Go on.

JOE
Good! You can eat on the way, let’s

But 22 chows down, completely enthralled by pizza.
JOE
Or you just take a few minutes.

22 finishes, licking her fingers.
22
Strange. I don’t feel so angry
anymore.
JOE
That’s great. Ready to find

MOONWIND
Oh! Well we’ll have to perform an
old fashioned astral transmigration
displacement.

It’s simply a way to get your souls

glorious ritual indeed, full of
chanting, dancing, and best of all,
bongos!

JOE
This would be hard even if I wasn't
wearing a hospital gown.
A cab finally stops a few yards away, about to let out
passengers.
JOE
Go! Go go go! Just run to that one!
22 hobbles over to the cab door just as it opens. They
suddenly come face to face with Dorothea Williams, the cab’s
departing passenger.
AHH!

Curley and Miho get out on the other side and GASP at 22.
Dorothea looks over 22, in stained hospital gown and gnawing
on a slice without a care.

No, it’s pepperoni.

22 and Joe step inside his small apartment. Floor-to-ceiling
shelves against a wall are lined with vinyl, surrounding an
upright piano. Next to it, an upright bass. Classic jazz
posters hang on other walls.

Finally, the phone goes silent.

Joe sees a “voicemail” pop up. He pushes play.

Hey, Mr. G. It’s Curley. Um... I

Outside is Connie, the trombonist from Joe’s middle school

CONNIE
Here, I quit! I think jazz is
pointless!
22
Oh yeah, jazz is definitely
pointless.
Hey!

JOE

CONNIE
In fact, all of school is a waste

22
Of course. Like my mentor George
Orwell used to say: state sponsored

CONNIE

Connie passes 22 her trombone. 22 quickly takes it. But as 22
talks Connie looks as if she’s just given up her dog.
22
You know, I really am glad there’s
someone else who sees how
ridiculous this place is. You’re

trombone case, opens it and pulls out the trombone:

He looks under the door to see Connie walk away. Joe jumps on
the doorknob, determined, hanging there desperately:

JOE
Because she loves to play. She
might say she hates everything, but
trombone is her thing. She’s good
at it. Maybe trombone is her Spark,
I don’t know.
22 ponders this.
JOE
Please. If I’m going to get this

Joe admires 22, now wearing his ill-fitting brown suit.

It’s a little tight in the backhere part.
22 points to the rear.
JOE
It’ll loosen. Sit down.
22 sits on the floor.
Joe pushes over a tall stack of records in front of 22, to
use as a stool. He picks up electric clippers.
22
I’ll do it.
JOE
You couldn’t call an elevator,
remember? No way. I just need to
line me up. Now be still.
Joe turns on the clippers. His entire cat body vibrates
unsteadily. He shakes as he reaches the clipper forward to
22’s hairline. 22 looks at him, leery.

Joe loses his footing on the stack of records. They shoot out
from under him. The clippers sail out of his paws and take a
big, long divot of hair out of 22’s scalp.
They hit the floor across the room, shattering.
Joe looks at the reverse-mohawk on 22’s scalp, horrified:

INT. BARBER SHOP.
Inside the neighborhood barber shop, hair gently falls to the
ground as the loud buzzing sound of multiple hair clippers
fills the shop. BARBERS are cutting and trimming the hair of
MEN and BOYS while razzing each other:

22 carries Joe into the shop. The customers and barbers all
give a synchronized silent “nod,” then go back to their
conversations.
Joe’s barber, DEZ, is about to take on a CUSTOMER.
DEZ
Hey, Joe! What’re you doing here on
a weekday? You didn’t call for an
appointment, man. It’s gonna be a

Aw, I was afraid of this. Go ahead

22 looks for a seat. Unthinking, she takes off her hat,
revealing the AWFUL CLIPPER DISASTER.
Everyone reacts:

CUSTOMER
What?! That ain’t cool, Dez!
DEZ
You could always let Harold cut
your hair. His chair’s wide open.
HAROLD, another barber, looks up from the newspaper he’s
reading while sitting in his empty barber chair. Through his
bottle-thick EYEGLASSES, he silently blinks and smiles, too
eager for a customer.
CUSTOMER
Nah. I can wait.
The customer takes a seat in the waiting area.
DEZ
Joe, get your butt in this chair.
NOW.
22 sits, still holding Joe. PAUL, the customer next to Dez,
scowls at Joe. They have a history.
DEZ
Should I even ask you how this
happened?
22
The cat did it.
JOE

Stop sounding insane.

Cool. I like being in the chair.
Everyone stares at 22. Joecat chides her.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN.
Joe finds a seat and sits, like a person -- on his butt, catfeet outstretched. He folds his paws across his cat-chest and
settles in for the ride like any New Yorker.
A NEW YORKER next to him looks at this, decides to scoot
over, not wanting any part of this weirdness.
22 remains standing as the doors close. The car is nearly
full. The train starts moving. 22 stumbles.
22
Whoah! AHH!
As the train moves, 22 has fun “surfing” it like a wave.
22
Woahahaho! Ha ha!
22 bumps into a COMMUTER.
COMMUTER
Hey! Take it easy, eh?
I’m sorry!

22

22 quickly sits next to Joe, feeling self-conscious.
JOE
Don’t worry about it. It’s the
subway. It does that to some
people.
Does what?

22

JOE
It wears you down. It stinks. It’s
hot. It’s crowded. Every day the
same thing, day in and day out.
(to self)
But once I get on that stage
tonight, all my troubles are going
to be fixed. You’re gonna see a
brand new Joe Gardner.
Joe hears a SLURPING sound. He turns to see 22 listening to
him, but now drinking a Big Gulp from a straw.
JOE
Where'd you get that?

Joe SLAPS it out of her hands.

22 and Joe walk up to his mom’s tailoring shop.
JOE
Alright, remember, I need the suit
fixed for a band recital. Got it?
22 nods. They enter.
INT. LIBBA’S CUSTOM TAILORING.
Melba and Lulu are busy behind sewing machines.
22 enters. Joe is on 22’s shoulders.
MELBA AND LULU
Joey! I’m so proud of you! Baby
boy, we heard the news!
But from the back room they hear a pointed:
Ahem!

LIBBA (O.S.)

Melba and Lulu freeze.
JOE
Oh, crap. She knows!
Melba gestures, cautiously:
LULU
Your momma's in the back.
JOE
You gotta go in there.
22
No, I don’t want to.
JOE
You have to! We need the suit
fixed!
22 gulps and starts walking. As they pass Melba:

MELBA
You forgetting something, Joey?
Melba holds out her cheek, waiting.
What?

22

JOE
Kiss her. I always kiss Melba when
I see her.
Melba leans her cheek out.
JOE
Just do it.
22 looks at Melba’s cheek, then grabs her face and goes in,
kissing her right on the lips. The women GASP.
JOE
No, no, no! Not on the lips.
LULU
(in horror)
Joey! What has gotten into you,
boy?
22 quickly releases Melba.
MELBA
(catching her breath)
Let him finish!
LULU
Cougar! I knew it.
22 and Joe walk into the back room as Melba calls after them:
MELBA
I’ll take another kiss when you get
back, Joey!

Libba spots the cat on 22’s shoulder.
LIBBA
I hope that cat isn’t supposed to
be some kind of peace offering.

Lulu and Melba press themselves against the door, trying to
hear what’s going on.
CUT TO:
BACK TO SCENE:
Joe whispers in 22’s ear, coaching:
JOE
Just say you rescued it.
22
(to Libba)
Um, no. It’s mine. I rescued it.
LIBBA
Hm. Too bad you can’t rescue your
career.
Joe sighs, not surprised.
JOE
Just ask her nicely if she can fix
my suit.
22
So, Mom... is there any way you can
fix this?
22 removes the jacket and reveals the large tear and polkadot underwear to Libba.
LIBBA
Whoah! I don’t need to see that!

No.

LIBBA
JOE AND 22

LIBBA
How long are you going to keep
doing this, Joey? You tell me
you’re going to accept the fulltime position...
JOE
Here it comes.
LIBBA
Then instead I hear you’ve taken on
another gig.
JOE
Tell her that this one’s different!
22
This one’s different!
LIBBA
Does this “gig” have a pension?
Health insurance? No? Then it’s the
same as the other ones. It’s like
you can’t even be truthful with me
anymore!
JOE
Fine, we’ll get the suit off the
rack somewhere. My mom has never
understood what I’m trying to do
with my life.
22
(repeating, to Libba)
Fine, we’ll get a suit off the rack

Can I run away now, like you
usually do?
Mom stares, waiting for a response from Joe.
Joe considers his options.
JOE
No. Not this time. Repeat after me.
Joe whispers into 22’s ear.
We SHIFT TO LIBBA’S POV -- to hear Joe talk to his mom in his
own voice:
JOE
Mom, I know we’ve had some rough
times. But you’re right. I can’t be
truthful with you. Because no
matter what I do, you disapprove.
LIBBA
Look, I know you love playing...
JOE
Then how come except for church,
you’re happiest when I don’t? I
finally land the gig of my life and
you’re upset.
LIBBA
You didn’t see how tough being a
musician was on your father. Î
don’t want to see you struggle like
that!
JOE
So Dad can pursue his dreams, and I
can’t?
LIBBA
Your father had me. Most times this
shop was what paid the bills. So
when I’m gone, who’s gonna pay
yours?
JOE
Music is all I think about. From
the moment I wake up in the morning
to the moment I fall asleep at
night.

LIBBA
You can’t eat dreams for breakfast,
Joey.
JOE
Then I don’t want to eat! This
isn’t about my career, Mom. It’s my
reason for living. And I know Dad
felt the same way.
Libba thinks about this.
JOE
And... I’m just afraid that if I
died today, that my life would’ve
amounted to nothing.
Joey...!

LIBBA

Libba looks into her son’s eyes, moved and slightly scared.
She breaks down a little, but then finally smiles.
She goes to a drawer and pulls out a large garment box.
LIBBA
Let’s make this work instead.
She opens it to reveal a tight, crisp BLUE SUIT.
We COME OUT OF LIBBA’S POV as:
Joe immediately recognizes the suit, stunned:
JOE
That’s... my dad’s suit.
LIBBA
(calls out)
Lulu! Melba! Bring your good
scissors in here. We got work to
do!
The eavesdropping Melba and Lulu almost tip over and fall
into the room as they try to cover their spying.
They get to work as Joe sits on a table, touched.

LATER.
22 surveys the NEW SUIT in a full-length MIRROR while Libba,
Melba and Lulu make adjustments.
Joe watches from the side, amazed.
22
Wow. This feels really nice!
Libba chuckles. Joe watches his mom lovingly make a few
adjustments, admiring the way her son looks in the mirror.
LULU AND MELBA
You look marvelous! This fits
perfectly! Just handsome! Mhmm.
LIBBA
That is one fine wool suit, if I do
say so myself.
22 points to a pocket-square.
22
Can I try on that?
LIBBA
Of course you can.
She puts the handkerchief square against the suit’s breast
pocket.
22
Thank you... um... Mom.
LIBBA
Ray woulda been so proud of you,
baby. Like I've always been.
Moved, Joe watches as Libba embraces 22; as Libba embraces
him. He’s awestruck at his mom’s turn.
Libba pushes 22 toward the door.
LIBBA
You heard me, right? The suit is
wool, not polyester.
22 picks up Joe.
LIBBA
So don’t go putting that cat on
your shoulders again!

Yes, ma’am!
22 walks to the door as Joe looks back at his mom, lovingly:
JOE
Thanks, mom.
EXT. LIBBA’S TAILOR SHOP.
Joe catches up to 22, now looking sharp in the blue suit.
JOE
Wow, that was amazing! Know what
that felt like? That felt like
jazz!
22
Yeah! You were jazzing!
JOE
Ha ha! Okay, jazzing!
EXT. NEW YORK - SUBWAY STAIRS. DUSK.
Joe and 22 emerge from the subway station in another part of
town, in the midst of conversation:
22
I’m telling you, Joe. You really
should call Lisa again.
JOE
I don’t really have time for a
relationship right now, 22.
22
Oh, busy right now? Want to wait
until you die a second time? Cool,

JOE
Heh heh. I can’t believe I’m
getting romantic advice from an

22
I could think of worse.

They both laugh as they turn the corner. Ahead is the Half
Note Jazz Club.
They run up to the club.
JOE
There it is! Ahh! We made it! This
is going to work!
Joe admires 22 in his dad’s suit.
JOE
Woah, I can’t believe how good I
look! The suit! The cut! Just look
at me! Heehee! Boodie-be-da!
As he looks at himself against the Half Note marquee, he gets
more excited:
JOE
Oh, just turn a little bit! Right
there!
Like this?

22

22 tries a few poses in front of the Half Note, getting into
it.
JOE
Angle the shoulders. Yeah!
22
Ha ha! Who’s that? And from this
side. Uh huh! Who’s back here?
Still me!
JOE
That’s a winner!
Right?

They sit. Joe admires the jazz club as he thinks on his
future:
JOE

This can’t be happening now! The

But as Joe talk, 22’s attention drifts to the world around

A FATHER plays with his DAUGHTER.
TWO CLOSE FRIENDS at a cafe LAUGH together.
A soft breeze lifts some fallen leaves, dancing them across
the sidewalk.
Sunlight falls across the buildings around them. 22 looks up
to see propellor seeds fall from a tree above.
One falls into 22’s hand.
22 stares at the seed. Something changes.
JOE (O.S.)
So, you ready?
22 comes out of it.
Huh?

22

JOE
To go home. Bet you’re ready to get
off this stinky rock, huh? What’d
you think of Earth anyway?
22 considers this.
22
I... always said it was dumb.
But... I mean... just look at what
I found!
22 brings out a bunch of OBJECTS from the suit pocket -- a
spool of thread, part of a bagel, a half-eaten lolly, etc.
22
Your mom sewed your suit from this
cute spool. When I was nervous, Dez
gave me this. A guy on the subway
yelled at me. It was scary... but I
kind of liked that too.
Joe regards 22, surprised.
22
The truth is I’ve always worried
that maybe there’s something wrong
with me, you know? That I’m not
good enough for living. But then
you showed me about purpose, and

Those really aren’t purposes, 22.
That’s just regular ol’ living. But

22
But I’ve been at the You Seminar

But as Joe pursues, the THERAPY CAT LADY comes up from the
same stairway, happy to see him.
She grabs Joe and tries forcing him into her cat carrier. But
Joe goes feral on her, a spinning ball of fur and claws.

But suddenly they are surrounded by darkness and they both
fall into Terry’s portal trap.

As 22 and Joe float through the inky darkness, their soul
forms emerge out from their respective bodies.
As Joe’s human body and the cat body float away, the souls of
Joe and 22 float upwards, to another portal leading back into
the You Seminar. Terry looks down on them, triumphant.

Joe sees his body far below. He frantically swims toward it,
making headway. He’s almost able to get into his own body.

As Joe walks something hits him on the back of his head.
He sees 22’s Earth Pass lying on the ground.
He locks eyes with 22, who stares angrily at him.

He absently dumps it on an end-table and puts his head in his
hand, mournfully fingering the piano keys.
Joe’s eyes fall back onto 22’s mementos. It triggers
something in Joe.
JOE REMEMBERS:
OUTSIDE THE HALF NOTE, the helicopter seed twirls into his
hand. But it is 22’s memory.
BACK AT HIS PIANO, Joe is startled. He looks at the pizza
crust.

AT THE DOOR STOOP, Joe thoroughly enjoys the pizza slice
moments after leaving the hospital. Again, this is 22’s
memory.
BACK AT HIS PIANO, Joe scoops the objects and places them on
the music ledge of the piano, studying them.
After a moment, he begins to play. Each item triggers other
specific MEMORIES:
- The BAGEL falling to the Busker’s guitar case.
- The LOLLIPOP segues into Dez’s sharp haircut.
- The THREAD SPOOL reminds him of his mother, Libba, passing
his dad’s suit onto him.
Joe smiles as other MEMORIES start to flow, inspiring the
music:
- Joe lies on the subway grate, feeling the wind beneath his
back.
- Watching Connie go into the zone while playing her
trombone.
Then deeper MEMORIES of Joe’s life emerge:
- A younger Libba gives her toddler-aged son Joe a bath.
- His father, Ray, drops a needle onto a jazz record, while
10-year-old Joe watches. They enjoy the music together.
- A teenaged Joe pedals a bike through the park, feeling the
freedom of summer.
- The morning light fills the streets of his Queens
neighborhood.
- Teenaged Joe watches a Mets game from a rooftop with his
parents. Fireworks explode against the city skyline.
The memories bring tears to Joe as he plays. More recent ones
start to come:
- In a diner, Joe sits alone eating a piece of pie, deeply
satisfied.
- Joe gives a young Curley his first pair of drumsticks,
inspiring him with a Max Roach record.
- Joe plays his piano for his ill father. Ray smiles as he
listens, lost in his son’s music.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
- Joe and his mother are alone at the beach, letting the
water wash over their bare feet.
The memories overwhelm Joe as he continues to play. He smiles
as tears fall. Slowly his perspective alters, lifting out of
himself, out of the city, off the Earth, and into the cosmos.
Suddenly another memory comes, as just voices:
22 (O.S.)
Maybe sky watching could be my
Spark. Or walking! I’m really good
at walking.
JOE (O.S.)
Those aren’t Sparks, 22. That’s
just regular ol’ living.
This snaps Joe back to Earth.
A disturbing thought takes hold. He picks up the helicopter
seed, gazing at it as he thinks about 22.
Joe makes a decision, puts the seed in his pocket, closes his
eyes, and begins playing again.
The room fades away as the music takes him into the zone.
EXT. THE ASTRAL PLANE.
Joe opens his eyes, now in the zone. He plays an astral piano
in his soul form, floating above the plane. Other souls in
the zone float on the horizon.
Joe!?

MOONWIND (O.S.)

Joe looks to see Moonwind aboard his ship, sailing toward
him.
MOONWIND
Joe! Good heavens, man! What are
you doing in the zone!
Moonwind!

JOE

Joe jumps onto the deck.
JOE
I messed up. I need to find 22.

MOONWIND
I’m afraid she’s become a Lost
Soul.
JOE
What? How is that possible?!
MOONWIND
I’ll explain on the way.
Moonwind speeds the ship across the Astral Plane.
MOONWIND
When neither of you returned to the
Half Note, I suspected something
had gone wrong.
CUT TO:
EXT. ASTRAL PLANE - FLASHBACK.
Moonwind steers the ship.
MOONWIND (V.O.)
I came back here, and that’s when I
spotted her.
Moonwind spots 22, now covered in astral dust -- DARK 22. He
waves at 22. But the Lost Soul runs off.
CUT TO:
BACK TO SCENE:
Joe scans a field of Lost Souls with a telescope as Moonwind
continues:
MOONWIND
Lost Souls are obsessed by
something that disconnects them
from life. And now that 22 has
technically lived, she’s become one
of them.
Joe finds Dark 22 in the distance.
JOE
There she is!
Good show!

MOONWIND

Moonwind steers the ship and pursues.
22!

JOE

Dark 22 HISSES at Joe and rockets off.
MOONWIND
Ready the net!
I’m on it!

JOE

Joe cocks the harpoon net and FIRES. The net wraps around
Dark 22 like a lasso. They try to reel 22 in.
But Dark 22 dives below the surface, forcing the bow of the
ship straight down into the dust.
MOONWIND
Oh no! She’s got us!
As the ship sinks, Joe jumps off.
Moonwind!

JOE

MOONWIND
(salutes)
A captain always goes down with the
ship. It has been a pleasure
serving with you-Moonwind and the entire ship is pulled down, vanishing into
the dust.
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK -- 14TH & 7TH. DAY.
Moonwind is spinning his sign. He is suddenly jolted out of
his trance.
CUT TO:
BACK TO SCENE:
Dark 22 pops up in the distance, HISSING at Joe. The soul
runs off again.
22!

JOE

Joe chases 22.
JOE
Come back, 22! It’s me, Joe!
Joe corners 22 between some astral rocks. 22 paces, animallike, cornered and scared.
JOE
Easy, 22! Easy. I just came back to
give you this.
Joe holds up the Earth Pass. But 22 panics, growing more
monstrous.
Easy...

JOE

Suddenly, 22 dives back into the sink cabinet and scrambles
through the shaft into the soul’s clubhouse.
Joe rushes after her.
JOE
22, listen! Come back!
INT. MENTOR ORIENTATION THEATER.
On stage, a Counselor presents a trophy to Terry, who beams
with pride.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
And for correcting our absentminded mistakes and setting the
count right, we are awarding you,
Terry, this trophy.
(beat)
As you requested.
A few Counselors in the audience APPLAUD with varying levels
of enthusiasm.
TERRY
I am happy to accept this very
special award I requested, but that
I absolutely deserve.
Suddenly, Dark 22 CRASHES THROUGH THE SCREEN and runs into
the audience HISSING and SHRIEKING. Joe runs after 22 as
everyone scatters.
The Counselor quickly takes back Terry’s trophy.

COUNSELOR JERRY B
And I’ll just take that back...
Hey!

TERRY

Angry, Terry pushes through the Counselors, stopping 22
before the soul can escape the theater.
TERRY
Oi, Noob! You’re not where you
belong!
But Dark 22 grows even more, towering above Terry. 22 pounces
on the accountant, tying Terry’s limbs into knots.
22 bolts out the door.
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Dark 22 runs through campus, Joe close behind. New Souls look
up at the Lost Soul in wonder.
JOE
22, stop! I have something to tell
you!
22 throws a New Soul at Joe. The New Soul LAUGHS as it
bounces off Joe’s face.
JOE
Ahh! Stop that! NO!
Joe is pelted by more New Souls before 22 runs off again.
Counselors keep the New Souls away from 22 while also trying
to calm the Lost Soul down.
COUNSELORS
There, there, calm down. Don’t
worry,You have to stop running.
Please.
22 ends up at the edge of the Earth Portal. The Lost Soul
looks down, scared and trapped.
Dark 22 runs away from Joe and ends up trapped at the edge of
the Earth Portal. She looks down, scared. She’s trapped!
22, stop!

JOE

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
22 looks at Joe as he slowly approaches. He holds out the
Earth Pass.
JOE
I was wrong! Please, will you
listen? You ARE ready to live, 22!
22 seems to calm. But suddenly the Lost Soul’s mouth opens.
It leaps and CONSUMES JOE!
INT. DARK 22.
Joe opens his eyes. He’s in total darkness. Black dust swirls
around him. He hears CRYING in the distance.
He sees 22 weeping and muttering in the middle of the storm.
22
(murmuring)
Not good enough. Nope. No point. I
just need to fill out that last
box. I give up.
Joe goes towards her, but 22 runs away.
22!

JOE

Joe follows.
Suddenly a huge, dark version of 22’s mentor, ABRAHAM
LINCOLN, appears in front of Joe, blocking him. Lincoln
appears to scold Joe, but in 22’s voice:
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
You're dishonest! All you make are
bad decisions! You are unwise, and
you won't make it in the world!
Joe tries to get around Lincoln. Mentor MOTHER THERESA
appears, blocking him again.
MOTHER THERESA
You're so selfish! No one would
ever want to be around you!
Joe struggles forward but is suddenly surrounded by other
mentors of 22 -- Copernicus, Carl Jung, Muhammad Ali, etc.
All bend down to Joe, reciting their negative opinions of 22:

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
22’S MENTORS
The world needs remarkable people,
and you're the least remarkable
soul I've ever met! The world is
better off without you in it!
You're a nitwit! Mentally unfit! An
imbecile! I cannot help you!
Joe breaks through the crowd, again finding 22 in the
distance. He runs to her as she mutters to herself:

22
There’s no point in anything I try.
Why couldn’t I fill out that last
box? I’m not good. Nothing I do is
right. I’m a loser. I don’t do
anything right. I’m not good enough
at all.
Joe nearly reaches 22, until -A final figure blocks Joe’s path: a massive version of JOE
HIMSELF.
NIGHTMARE JOE
You will never find your spark.
There's no point. Those aren’t
purposes, you IDIOT! That’s just
regular ol’ living. This is a waste
of time. You only got that badge
because you were in MY body. That’s
why you ruin everything! Because
you. Have. No. Purpose!!
Nightmare Joe SPEWS BLACK DUST from his mouth. Joe tumbles
away, the Earth Pass is knocked out of his hands. He
desperately searches for it.
JOE
Ahhh! No no no no!
All seems lost, until Joe remembers -- the helicopter seed in
his pocket. He pulls it out and walks forward, holding out
the seed to his nightmare self.
NIGHTMARE JOE
There’s no point. You’ll never find
your Spark Because you. Have. No.
Purpose!!
Nightmare Joe looks at the seed, startled. He melts away,
defeated.

Joe finally reaches 22. He puts the seed in her hand, closing
her fingers around it, holding it there. 22 appears to calm.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. HALF NOTE. DAY.
Suddenly, 22 is back in Joe’s body, sitting on the stoop and
looking at the seed, scared.
Joe, back in the cat, looks up at her, smiling.
You ready?
Huh?

JOE
22

JOE
To come live!
22
I’m scared, Joe. I’m not good
enough. And anyway I never got my
Spark.
JOE
Yes you did.
Joe motions to the world around them.
JOE
Your Spark isn’t your purpose. That
last box fills in when you’re ready
to come live.
22 looks around, taking in the beautiful, simple moments on
Earth.
JOE
And the thing is... you're pretty
great at jazzing.
22 looks at Joe and smiles.
MATCH CUT TO:
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Dark 22 smiles at Joe. The black dust surrounding the Lost
Soul melts away.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
Joe finds the Earth Pass and places it on 22. 22 smiles, but
then realizes:
22
But Joe... This mean you won’t get
to-JOE
It’s okay. I already did. Now it’s
your turn.
Joe motions to the Earth below.
22 steps closer to the edge, but gets cold feet and darts
behind Joe.
JOE
I’ll go with you.
22
You know you can’t do that.
JOE
I know. But I’ll go as far as I
can.
22 steps closer to the edge. Joe holds out his hand. 22 takes
it and holds tight as they both jump.
INTO THE EARTH PORTAL.
Eyes shut tight, 22 clutches Joe’s arm as they free-fall
toward Earth.
JOE
Hey! Take a look!
22 slowly opens one eye, then both.
The Earth slowly gets bigger as they fall toward it. The view
is spectacular.
Wow!

22

22 starts to enjoy the ride. The soul builds enough courage
to let go of Joe’s arm and hold his hand.
Hand-in-hand, 22 and Joe skydive to Earth, enjoying the ride.
22’s Earth Pass starts to glow, slowly drawing the soul away
from Joe.
22 looks at Joe reluctantly, unsure.

7/17/2020 Soul Academy Draft
But Joe smiles back, as if to say “it’ll be okay.”
Then he gently lets go.
22 pulls away from Joe. He watches the soul fall the entire
way, and then vanish.
Tears well in Joe’s eyes. He is pulled away from Earth and
back up as we:
FADE TO WHITE.
EXT. LIMBO -- SLIDEWALK.
Joe opens his eyes to find he is on the slidewalk, heading
towards the Great Beyond.
He smiles, at peace. Ready. Until:
COUNSELOR JERRY A (O.S.)
Mr. Gardner?
Joe turns to see a Counselor on the slidewalk with him.
Yes?

JOE

COUNSELOR JERRY A
Do you have a moment?
Joe walks over to Jerry.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
I think I’m speaking for all the
Jerrys when I say... thank you.
For what?

JOE

COUNSELOR JERRY A
We’re in the business of
inspiration, Joe, but it’s not
often we find ourselves inspired.
JOE
Oh, really.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
So, we all decided to give you
another chance.
The Counselor opens a Portal. On the other side is Earth.

COUNSELOR JERRY A
Hopefully you will watch where you
walk from now on.
JOE
But what about Terry?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
We worked it out with Terry.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. LIMBO -- ABOVE THE SLIDEWALK.
Again, Terry is counting souls on the abacus. Suddenly, one
of the beads draws her attention.
TERRY
Hmmm. That’s weird.
A Counselor comes running up:
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Hey Terry, what’s that over there?
Look immediately!
TERRY
What? What are you talking about?
Terry looks the other way. The Counselor’s arm stretches
behind Terry and slides the single bead on the abacus into
position, covering up the discrepancy.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Oh, nothing. You were saying?
Hmm.

TERRY

COUNSELOR JERRY B
Were you even talking? I can’t
remember.
Terry once again examines the abacus.
Nevermind.

TERRY

Terry goes back to counting.

BACK TO THE SLIDEWALK:
The Counselor motions to Earth as Joe hesitates.
Well?

COUNSELOR JERRY A

Joe considers as he looks to Earth, then smiles to the
Counselor warmly:
Thanks.

JOE

COUNSELOR JERRY A
So what do you think you’ll do? How
are you going to spend your life?
He thinks for a moment.
JOE
I’m not sure...
He steps into the Portal.
MATCH CUT TO:
EXT. JOE’S APARTMENT. DAY
Joe’s feet step out of his apartment building. He smiles as
he looks around, taking in the glorious chaos of it all.
JOE (O.S.)

every minute of it.
