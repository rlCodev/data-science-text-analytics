FINAL SCRIPT

ii.

A note on design:
The majority of the film is to be made in the studio,
on a set representing Anthony's flat.
As the film goes on, the appearance of the flat will
evolve. This development is indicated in the script by
numbers 1 to 5, thus:
1. Anthony's flat.
2. Anne's flat.
etc. In every case, the space is identical. The décor is
the only indication that we might be in a different
place. The intended aim is to create uncertainty and the
impression of being simultaneously in the same location
and somewhere different - ultimately, a hospital.

Principal characters:
ANTHONY
is about 80. He lives on his own in London. He was an
engineer and has two daughters, ANNE and LUCY.
ANNE
is ANTHONY's older daughter. She's a translator, working
in London. In the absence of her sister, she looks after
her father's daily needs; she's extremely attached to
him.
PAUL
is a banker who's worked in London for many years. He
lives with ANNE.
LAURA
is a young carer of about 30. She glows with the
freshness of youth.
THE MAN
is a stranger when he first appears. Eventually we learn
his name is BILL and that he works in a care home.
THE WOMAN
is a stranger when she first appears. Eventually we learn
her name is CATHERINE and that she works in a care home.

STREET IN LONDON

DAY

1

Music. ANNE emerges from the entrance to a tube station into
a London street. She’s in a hurry, her expression serious.
She arrives, across from a familiar block of flats. She
crosses the street in such a rush, she’s almost hit by a
taxi. She steps into the building.

ANNE climbs the stairs. She arrives on the second floor and
rings a bell. Then, impatient, she fetches a bunch of keys
out of her handbag and opens the door.

ANNE moves from one room to another, her anxiety mounting.
ANNE
Dad? It’s me... Are you there? Dad?
No answer. Tension rises. She steps into 4

OFFICE

DAY

- ANTHONY’s office and finds him. He’s sitting in his
armchair, listening to music on his headphones.
ANNE
Ah, there you are.
He’s surprised to see her. He takes off his headphones
immediately. The music we’ve been hearing cuts out, as if
it’s been coming through ANTHONY’s headphones.
ANTHONY
What are you doing here?
ANNE
What do you think?
He seems irritated by his daughter’s unexpected arrival.
She notices the curtains are closed and goes over to open
them. She turns towards him.
ANNE (CONT’D)
So? What happened?
He turns off the music.

ANTHONY
Nothing.
ANNE
Tell me.
ANTHONY
I just did. Nothing happened.
ANNE
Nothing happened?

ANTHONY looks at her as if to say: “Nothing at all.”
ANNE (CONT’D)
I’ve just had her on the phone.
ANTHONY
So? What does that prove?
ANNE
You can’t go on behaving like this.
ANTHONY
It’s my flat, isn’t it? I mean,
this is incredible. You burst in on
me as if... I’ve no idea who she
is, this woman. I never asked her
for anything.
ANNE
She’s here to help you.
ANTHONY
To help me do what? I don’t need
her. I don’t need anyone.
Abruptly, he decides to leave the room.

INT.

LIVING ROOM

DAY

ANTHONY goes to the piano and starts playing a couple of
notes.
He turns his back on her as she appears in the doorway.
ANNE
She told me you’d called her a
little bitch. And I don’t know what
else.
ANTHONY
Me?
He shrugs his shoulders.

ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Could be. I don’t remember.
ANNE
She was in tears.
ANTHONY
What, just because I called her
a...
ANNE
No. She told me you threatened her.
Physically.

ANTHONY stops playing the piano and turns back to her.
ANTHONY
Physically? Me? Obviously she has
no idea what she’s talking about.
This woman is raving mad, Anne.
Best if she does leave, believe me.
ANNE sighs. She looks desperate. ANTHONY becomes aware of
this.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Especially as...
ANNE
As what?
ANTHONY
Listen... I didn’t want to tell
you... but if you must know, I
suspect she was...
He breaks off. ANNE looks at him as if to say: “She was
what?”
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
She was stealing from me.
ANNE
Angela? Of course not. What are you
talking about?
ANTHONY
I’m telling you. She stole my
watch.
ANNE
Your watch?
ANTHONY
Yes.

ANNE
Isn’t it more likely you just lost
it?
ANTHONY
No, no, no. I already had my
suspicions. So I set a trap for
her. I left my watch somewhere, out
in the open, to see if she’d pinch
it.

He illustrates this with a vague hand gesture.
ANNE
Where? Where did you leave it?
ANTHONY
Mm? Somewhere. Can’t remember. All
I know is it’s nowhere to be found.
That girl stole it. I know she did.
ANNE sits down. She looks winded.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
What’s the matter?
ANNE
I don’t know what to do.
ANTHONY looks at her as if to say: “What about?”
ANNE (CONT’D)
We have to talk, Dad.
ANTHONY
That’s what we’re doing, isn’t it?
ANNE
I mean, seriously. This is the
third one you’ve...
ANTHONY
I said, I don’t need her! I don’t
need her or anyone else! I can
manage very well on my own!
Obviously, ANNE isn’t listening; she continues pursuing her
thread, which annoys ANTHONY.
ANNE
She wasn’t easy to find, you know.
It’s not that easy. I thought she
was really good. A lot of good
qualities. She... and now she
doesn’t want to work here any more.

ANTHONY
You’re not listening to what I’m
telling you. This girl stole my
watch! I’m not going to live with a
thief.
ANNE
Have you looked in your bathroom
cupboard?
ANTHONY
What?
ANNE
In your bathroom cupboard. Behind
the boiler. Where you hide your
valuables.

This remark seems to stagger ANTHONY.
ANTHONY
How do you know?
ANNE
I just know, that’s all.
ANTHONY
Have you been in my cupboard? Anne,
tell me the truth.
ANNE
No!
ANTHONY
Then how do you know that... I
mean... that I sometimes... with my
valuables...
ANNE
I can’t remember. I must have
opened it by accident.
ANTHONY looks appalled. He hurries off towards his bathroom.
ANNE (CONT’D)
Where are you going? I didn’t touch
anything, Dad.
He leaves the room. ANNE sighs.

LIVING ROOM

DAY

6B

ANNE is waiting for him in the living room. She sighs. She
knows they can not go on like this... She hardly knows what
to make of the situation.
She sees the painting on the wall. This is her sister’s
painting. Things would have been easier for her if LUCY were
here...
She sees ANTHONY step into the office. He turns on the T.V.
Has he forgotten she’s there?
Her father’s absurd behaviour almost makes her smile.
She gets up to go and join him 7

INT.

OFFICE

DAY

- in the office. He’s sitting in his armchair, flicking
through the channels on his T.V., until he reaches a Fred
Astaire movie. He watches Fred tap-dancing, entranced.
ANNE appears in the doorway. She looks at him for a moment
without saying anything.
ANNE
You found it.
ANTHONY
What?
ANNE
Your watch.
ANTHONY
Oh. Yes.
ANNE
You realise Angela had nothing to
do with it.
ANTHONY
Only because I hid it. Luckily.
Just in time! Otherwise, I’d be
sitting here talking to you with no
means of knowing what time it was.
It’s five o’clock, if you’re
interested. Myself, I am
interested. Pardon me for
breathing.

ANNE
Have you taken your pills?

ANTHONY uses the remote to turn off the TV.
ANTHONY
Yes. But why are you...? You keep
looking at me as if there was
something wrong. Everything’s fine,
Anne. The world is turning. You’ve
always been that way. A worrier.
Like your mother. Your mother was
always scared. Always looking for
reasons to be scared. Whereas your
sister has always been much more...
At least she doesn't keep badgering
me.
Pause.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Where is she, by the way? Have you
heard from her?
No answer from ANNE.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
I’m asking you a question...
ANNE
I’m going to have to move, Dad.
ANTHONY looks at her, not understanding.
ANNE (CONT’D)
I’m going to have to leave London.
ANTHONY
Really? Why?
ANNE
We talked about this. Do you
remember?
Brief pause. ANTHONY doesn’t seem to know what she’s talking
about.
ANTHONY
Is that why you’re so keen on this
nurse living with me? Well,
obviously it is. The rats are
leaving the ship.
ANNE
I won’t be here, Dad. I won’t be
able to come here everyday. You
need to understand that.

ANTHONY suddenly looks fragile.
ANTHONY
You’re leaving? When? I mean...
why?
ANNE
I’ve met someone.
ANTHONY
You?
ANNE
Yes.
ANTHONY
You mean... a man?
ANNE
Yes.
ANTHONY
Really?
ANNE
You needn’t sound so surprised.
ANTHONY
No, it’s just that... since your...
What was his name?
ANNE
James.
ANTHONY
That’s right. You have to admit,
since James, there hasn’t been a
lot of... What’s he do, anyway?
ANNE
He lives in Paris. I’m going to go
and live there.
ANTHONY
What, you? In Paris? You’re not
going to do that, are you, Anne? I
mean, wake up... They don’t even
speak English.
Pause.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Do I know him?
ANNE
Yes. You’ve met him.

Pause. He’s trying to remember.
ANTHONY
So, if I understand correctly,
you’re leaving me. Is that it?
You’re abandoning me...
ANNE
Dad...
He suddenly looks really anxious.
ANTHONY
What’s going to become of me?
She approaches him, her expression tender.
ANNE
You know, it’s important to me.
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be going.
I... I really love him.
Pause. He says nothing.
ANNE (CONT’D)
I’ll come back and see you often.
At weekends. But I can’t leave you
here all on your own. It’s not
possible. That’s why. If you refuse
to have a carer, I’m going to have
to...
ANTHONY
To what?
Pause. She doesn’t answer.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
To what?
ANNE
You have to understand, Dad.
ANTHONY
You’re going to have to what?
She lowers her eyes. Pause.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Anne... you’re going to have to

DAY

ANTHONY stands at his bedroom window. He’s watching his
daughter cross the street and walk away from the block of
flats. She doesn’t look back.
He can’t get over the fact that his daughter - his own
daughter - is capable of threatening him in this way.
He turns away from the window. He sits on the bed. He thinks
for a moment, his expression anxious.

INT.

KITCHEN

9

DAY

ANTHONY switches on the radio. It’s a Verdi aria. He hums
along with it.
He starts making tea.
There are shopping bags on the table. ANTHONY seems surprised
to see them. Who’s put them there?
He inspects their contents and decides to put the shopping
away in the cupboard. He seems to be on top of the situation.
There’s a poster on a wall, some French landscape with a
lake, perhaps.
Suddenly, he hears a door closing, within the flat. He
listens. He switches off the radio, listens again.
Footsteps. There’s someone in the flat.
He hesitates for a moment, not sure how to proceed. To
reassure himself, he picks up a fork.
He leaves the kitchen.

He pushes open the door. In the middle of the room, reading
his emails on his mobile, is a stranger, a tall, dark man of
about 50. The MAN glances up at him, no particular reaction:
then resumes reading his smartphone.
MAN
Everything all right?
ANTHONY
Who are you?
MAN
Sorry?
ANTHONY
What are you doing here? What are
you doing in my flat?
The MAN looks at him, astonished.
MAN
Anthony, it’s me... Paul.
ANTHONY
What?
MAN
Don’t you recognise me? It’s me,
Paul.
The MAN takes a step in ANTHONY’s direction, which causes him
to back away.
ANTHONY
Who? What are you doing here?
MAN
I live here.
ANTHONY
You?
MAN
Yes.
ANTHONY
You live here?
MAN
Yes.
ANTHONY
You live in my flat? That’s the
best yet. What is this nonsense?

MAN
I... I’m going to phone Anne.

Seeing ANTHONY’s apparent confusion, the MAN clarifies:
MAN (CONT’D)
Your daughter.
ANTHONY
Thank you, yes, I do know who Anne
is! Do you know her? You a friend
of hers?
No answer. The MAN is dialling a number.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
I’m speaking to you. Do you know
Anne?
MAN
I’m her husband.
ANTHONY is caught off guard.
ANTHONY
Her husband?
MAN
Yes.
ANTHONY
But... since when?
MAN
Coming up for ten years.
ANTHONY tries to conceal his dismay.
ANTHONY
Ah, yes. Of course. Yes, yes.
Obviously. Ten years already? Time
passes at such a lick... But I
thought... Didn’t you, aren’t you
separated?
MAN
Who? Anne and me?
ANTHONY
Yes. You aren’t?
MAN
No.
ANTHONY
Are you sure? I mean... I mean, are
you sure ?

DINING ROOM

DAY

The MAN moves into the dining room in order not to be
overheard by ANTHONY.
MAN
No, it’s just your father isn’t
feeling very well. I think he’d
like to see you.
ANTHONY doesn’t know what to make of the situation. He
realises he still has a fork in his hand. He slips it
discreetly into his pocket.
MAN (CONT’D)
Fine, but don’t be too long.
He hangs up, turns to ANTHONY.
MAN (CONT'D)
She’s just doing some shopping.
She’ll be up in a minute.
ANTHONY
She told me she was going to go and
live in Paris. She told me the
other day.
MAN
Paris?
He moves into the Living Room, takes the newspaper.

ANTHONY
Yes.
MAN
What was she going to do in Paris?
ANTHONY
She’s met a Frenchman.

The MAN frowns at him. He knows it isn’t true.
MAN
I don’t think so, Anthony.
ANTHONY
Yes, she has. She told me the other
day. I’m not an idiot. She told me
she was moving. To go and live with
him. I even remember telling her it
was a stupid idea because, you
know, they don’t even speak
English. You don’t know about this?
MAN
No.
ANTHONY
Oops.
MAN
What?
ANTHONY
Have I put my foot in it?
Brief pause. The MAN is amused.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
I’ve put my foot in it.
MAN
No, no, don’t worry. She hasn’t
mentioned it to me, but I’m sure
she was intending to...
ANTHONY
You didn’t know anything about the
Frenchman?
MAN
No.
ANTHONY
Oops-a-daisy...
Pause. ANTHONY puts a hand on his shoulder.

Never mind. Chin up. Anyway, they
all end up leaving sooner or later.
I speak from experience.

Brief pause. The MAN heads towards the kitchen to get himself
a glass of wine.
MAN
You want something to drink while
we’re waiting? Glass of water?
Fruit juice?

No, but I mean... What was I going

I’ve forgotten her name. That girl
your wife insists on handing me
over to. A nurse. You know about
this? As if I wasn’t able to manage
on my own...

continuing to talk to him in the entrance hallway.

He’s trying to remember the name of the MAN, who’s installed
himself in the armchair, resolved to read the newspaper and
to drink his glass of wine.
MAN
Paul.
ANTHONY
That’s right, Paul. Take a good
look at me. I can still manage on
my own. Don’t you think? I’m not
completely...
He hunches over like an old man.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
You agree? Of course you agree. But
her? I don’t know where this stupid
obsession comes from. She’s always
been that way. Ever since she was
little. Thing is, she’s not very
bright. Not very... you agree? Not
very intelligent. She gets that
from her mother.
MAN
I think she tries to do the best
she can for you, Anthony.
ANTHONY
The best she can, the best she
can... I never asked her for
anything. I don’t know what she’s
cooking up against me. But she’s
cooking something up. She’s cooking
something up, that I do know. I
suspect she wants to put me in a
home for...
He pulls a face representing an old man.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Yes, I’ve seen the signs. But let
me make something absolutely clear:
I’m not leaving my flat! I’m not
leaving it!
To underline his last sentence, he makes a strong gesture along the lines of a single firm hand to the table, as if to
mark his territory. His force unintentionally sends the chess
pieces falling to the ground.
The MAN decides to put down his newspaper.
MAN
This isn’t your flat, Anthony.

you were waiting for...

What?
MAN
For a new carer. Because you
quarrelled with the last one...
With Angela.
ANTHONY
Did I?
MAN
Yes. Don’t you remember? That’s why
you’re staying in our place. While
you wait.
Pause. ANTHONY looks slightly lost. He looks at the furniture
around him. It’s definitely his flat.
ANTHONY
So, James...
MAN
Paul.
ANTHONY
Yes, Paul... So you’re telling me,
I’m in your place.
MAN
Yes.

completely different WOMAN.
WOMAN is taking off her coat.
WOMAN
What’s happening?
The MAN has appeared in the corridor behind ANTHONY.
MAN
Nothing much. Your father seemed a
bit... confused.
WOMAN
Something wrong? Are you all right,
Dad?
He obviously doesn’t recognise her.
WOMAN (CONT’D)
Dad?
He recoils as she approaches. He can’t understand why she’s
calling him “dad”. To him, she’s a complete stranger.
ANTHONY
I... What is this nonsense?
WOMAN
What are you talking about?
ANTHONY
Where’s Anne?
The WOMAN looks at the MAN. Now it’s she who seems confused.
WOMAN
Sorry?
ANTHONY
Anne. Where is she?
She realises he doesn’t recognise her. She glances anxiously
at the MAN.
WOMAN
I’m here, Dad... I went downstairs
to do some shopping. And now I’m
back.
ANTHONY tries to conceal his dismay.

You look worried.

Dad, I’m not married.
ANTHONY
Sorry?
WOMAN
I got divorced more than five years
ago. Have you forgotten?
ANTHONY
What? Well, then, who’s he?
WOMAN
Who?
ANTHONY
Are you doing this on purpose? I’m
talking about... him. Who just left
with the chicken.
WOMAN
The chicken? What are you on about,
Dad?
ANTHONY
Right here, just a minute ago. Did
you not hand over a chicken to
someone?
Clearly, she doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

BEDROOM 2

DAY - PT1

He arrives in the bedroom. It occupies the same space as his
first bedroom, but some elements of the décor and furniture
have changed - as if he was indeed in a different flat.
He’s aware of this difference. He frowns. He goes to the
window. He draws the curtain.

WOMAN
What’s the matter, Dad?
ANTHONY
There’s something funny going on.
Believe me, Anne, there’s something
funny going on!
WOMAN
Come and sit down. Come on...
He goes and sits on his bed. He’s upset. The WOMAN smiles at
him and rests a hand on his.
WOMAN (CONT’D)
Now don’t worry. Everything’ll sort
itself out. Mm?
ANTHONY
I don’t know.
WOMAN
Yes, it will. Don’t worry. Have you
taken your medication?
ANTHONY
What’s that got to do with
anything?
WOMAN
Let’s give you your medication. The
evening dose. Then you’ll feel
better.
She shakes some pills out of a bottle by the bed. Anthony
stares out into space. He speaks to her as if confiding a
secret.
ANTHONY
It’s been going on for some time.
Strange things going on around us.
Haven’t you noticed? There was this
man claiming this wasn’t my flat. A
really unsympathetic-looking man. A
bit like your husband. Only worse.
In my flat, you understand what I’m
saying? It’s the best yet. Don’t
you think? In my flat. He told
me...
ANTHONY is suddenly seized by a doubt.

Brief pause.

LAURA
No, thanks.

Make yourself comfortable.
She sits down.

ANNE indicates her father’s room. She sets off in that

He’s a bit upset by the whole idea

LAURA
That’s OK.
ANNE
Yes. And that can cause him to...
Anyway, I think he’s a bit annoyed
with me. I’m telling you this just
to warn you he’s capable of
reacting... unexpectedly.
LAURA
Has he lived on his own up to now?
ANNE
Yes. In a flat, not too far from

in on him practically every day.
But eventually, we’ve had to come
to another arrangement. It wasn’t
viable any more.

He turns to LAURA.

My daughter has a tendency to

LAURA smiles at what she takes to be a joke.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Would you like something to drink?
LAURA
You’re very kind, but no thanks.
ANTHONY

ANNE’s interruption irritates ANTHONY.
ANTHONY

He turns to LAURA, his smile back in place.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
What would you like?
LAURA
What are you going to have?
ANTHONY
A small whisky.
LAURA
Then I’ll have the same.

Excellent.
He speaks to ANNE as if she’s a waitress.

ANNE goes to look for two glasses of whisky.

sister... That was quite another

LAURA
You have two daughters?
ANTHONY
That’s right. Even though I hardly
ever hear from the other one. Lucy.
All the same, she was always my
favorite.
ANNE’s expression: she’s hurt.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Do you ever hear from her? I don’t
understand why she never gets in
touch. Never. Dazzling girl. A
painter. Look. Beautiful, isn’t it?
He indicates a painting on the wall. It’s rather a haunting
image of a park, a big tree and a couple of small figures
walking hand-in-hand in the shadow of the tree. CLOSE-UP of
the painting.
LAURA
Yes, it is...

Your whisky.

Thank you.

ANTHONY (CONT’D)
You see, the situation’s very
simple. I’ve been living in this
flat... oh, for a long time now.
I’m extremely attached to it. I
bought it more than thirty years
ago. Can you imagine? You weren’t
even born. It’s a big flat. And my
daughter is very interested in it.
ANNE
What are you talking about?
ANTHONY
Let me explain. My daughter is of
the opinion that I can’t manage on
my own. So she’s moved in with me.
Ostensibly to help me. With this
man she met not long ago, just
after her divorce, who has a very
bad influence on her, I have to
tell you.

But it’s not going to happen that
way. I may as well tell you. I have
no intention of leaving any time
soon. No, you heard me. I intend to
outlive you. Both of you. Yes.
Well, I don’t know about you... But
my daughter, yes. I shall make a
point of it. I’m going to inherit
from her. Not the other way round.
The day of her funeral, I shall
give a little speech to remind
everyone how heartless and
manipulative she was.

Why? She understands completely.
You’re the one who doesn’t

well on my own. But she refuses to
listen. I don’t need any help from
anyone and I will not leave my

bugger off!
He empties his glass, fetches a banknote out of his pocket

PAUL’s a man of about 50. Unlike the MAN, there seems nothing

attentive. He’s obviously at home in the flat, which he

Mm? Yes, yes... I think so. She
said she’d start tomorrow.

So... Anthony, is it?

Yes.
He looks quite unhappy.
DOCTOR
Date of birth?
ANTHONY
31st December, 1937. Why?
DOCTOR
You’re living with your daughter at
the moment, is that right?
ANTHONY
Yes. Until she goes to live in
Paris.
ANNE
No, Dad, why do you keep going on
about Paris?
ANTHONY
What?
ANNE
I’m staying in London.
ANTHONY
You keep changing your mind. How do
you expect people to keep up?
ANNE
But there was never any question of
going to Paris, Dad.

Yes, there was. You told me.

ANTHONY (CONT’D)
She’s forgotten. Listen, Anne, I

from memory loss. I should have a

from the corridor. He looks completely helpless. Then,
flooded with compassion, she crosses over to help him.

ANTHONY allows her to help him. He looks at her with great

ANNE
Is it because of your watch? Dad,
is that the reason? I found it,
look! Shush. Come on, don’t cry.
As she speaks, she’s holding him in her arms and stroking his
hair. She looks at PAUL with a concerned expression.
ANNE (CONT’D)
You’ll be all right now. Mm? Shush.
You’ll be all right. You’ll be all
right. Let’s eat our chicken. Shall
we? You like chicken, don’t you?
ANTHONY
But what time is it?
ANNE
It’s seven o’clock. Time to eat.
ANTHONY
Seven o’clock in the evening?
ANNE
Yes, Dad.
ANTHONY
But I thought it was morning. I’ve
only just got up. Look, I’m still
in my pyjamas.
ANNE
No, it’s evening and I’ve cooked
you a chicken. Come on, let’s eat.

to dance. That you were good at tap
dancing.
ANTHONY
Me?
ANNE
Yes.
ANNE’s laughing again; ANTHONY has a childlike smile.
ANTHONY
And what did she say?
ANNE
She said she hoped you’d give her a

Funny. I didn’t even know I knew
how to tap dance. Did you?

Just to see the way you did things
and whether I could help you.

Emotion prevents her from finishing her sentence. She
searches for some less direct way of approaching the subject.

It looks on to the park.

I think you might be better off
here.
ANTHONY looks completely lost.
