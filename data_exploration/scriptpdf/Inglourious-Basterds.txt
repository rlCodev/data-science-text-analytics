EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:
CHAPTER ONE
“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .
NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”
This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:
“1941
One year into the German
occupation of France”
The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings
an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property.
However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at
this stump for the last year or just started today.
JULIE
one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on
the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a
noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:
JULIE’S POV
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in
the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles,
coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.
JULIE
Pappa.
The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his
shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.
The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans
approaching.
The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.

[2]

FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash
up with, then get inside with your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out,
splashing into the basin.
The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his
face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a
year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the
windowsill.
JULIE
Ready, Pappa.
FARMER
Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care
of your mother. Don’t run.
Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the
windowsill with the water basin . . .
. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get
LOUDER.
The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance,
like the farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the
door for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:
NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

[3]

NAZI DRIVER
Yes, Herr Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle,
carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.
NAZI OFFICER
Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left
alone.
NAZI DRIVER
As you wish, Herr Colonel.
The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH:
NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long
strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:
NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur
LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his
hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.
PERRIER
How may I help you?
COL. LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside your
home and we may have a discussion.
INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY
The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for
the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German
steps inside the Frenchman’s home.
Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s
wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen,
smiling in his direction.
The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

[4]

PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of
the French farmer’s wife . . .
COL. LANDA
Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his
hostess’s hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.
FARMER’S WIFE
Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.
While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her
eyes, the S.S. colonel says:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in
the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And each of your daughters is more lovely than
the last.
PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer
and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the
table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.
The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:
PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the
Colonel some wine?

[5]

COL. LANDA
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in
assuming you have milk?
CHARLOTTE
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.
CHARLOTTE
Very well.
The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.
The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it
down LOUDLY on the wooden table.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I
say: Bravo.
PERRIER
Merci.
COL. LANDA
Please, join me at your table.
PERRIER
Very well.
The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from
the Nazi.
The women remain standing.
Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of
confidentiality:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private. You’ll
notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t
offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies
to step outside?
PERRIER
You are right.

[6]

PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her
daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s
humble home.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve
exhausted the extent of my French. To continue
to speak it so inadequately would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I’ve been led
to believe you speak English quite well?
PERRIER
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This
being your house, I ask your permission to
switch to English for the remainder of the
conversation.
PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with
you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar
with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The farmer answers:
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve
been ordered to carry out in France?

[7]

PERRIER
Yes.
The colonel drinks more milk.
COL. LANDA
Please tell me what you’ve heard?
PERRIER
I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of
rounding up the Jews left in France who are
either hiding or passing for gentile.
The S.S. colonel smiles.
COL. LANDA
The Führer couldn’t have said it better
himself.
PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though
it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months
ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
COL. LANDA
I’m aware of that. I read the report on this
area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there’s always a
slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being
a complete waste of time, but it needs to be
done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my
department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table,
he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive
black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the
folder and referring to it:
COL. LANDA
Now, before the occupation there were four
Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers
like yourself:
the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins,
and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?

[8]

PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers:
COL. LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.
The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S.
colonel studies the papers in front of him.
COL. LANDA
Now, according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have been
accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in
the last year it would appear they have
vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve
either made good their escape
or someone is very successful hiding them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at the
farmer)
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses,
Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER
Only rumors—
COL. LANDA
—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where

rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So,
Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard
regarding
the Dreyfuses?
The farmer looks at Landa.

[9]

COL. LANDA
Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear
what the rumors are, not who told them to you.
The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.
PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor—but we
heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into
Spain.
COL. LANDA
So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?
As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards, revealing:
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human
beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what
the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has
done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that
wishes to exterminate them.
PERRIER
We were families in the same community, in the
same business. I wouldn’t say
we were friends, but members of the same
community. We had common interests.
The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then
moves to the next question.
COL. LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you
confirm for me the exact members of the
household and their names?

[10]

PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her
brother, Bob . . .
COL. LANDA
—How old is Bob?
PERRIER
Thirty—thirty-one?
COL. LANDA
Continue.
PERRIER
And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Ages of the children?
PERRIER
Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.
CUT TO
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off
the clothesline.
They can’t hear anything going on inside.
The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.
BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER
COL. LANDA
Well, I guess that should do it.
He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his
attaché case.
The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
COL. LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?

[11]

PERRIER
But of course.
The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the
carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s
glass, the German officer talks.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given me?
PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.
COL. LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?
PERRIER
I’m aware.
COL. LANDA
What are you aware of?
PERRIER
That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”
COL. LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in
repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of
Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would
hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me.
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title, precisely because
I’ve earned it.
As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the French farmer.
COL. LANDA
The feature that makes me such an effective
hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German
soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can
only think like a German or, more precisely, a
German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute the
German people share with a beast, it would be the
cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.

[12]

COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical
strength—penis size.
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast, it would
be that of the rat.
Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have
said pretty much the same thing. Where our
conclusions differ is I don’t consider the
comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world
indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it with
hostility?
PERRIER
I suppose I would.
COL. LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?
PERRIER
Rats spread disease, they bite people—
COL. LANDA
Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a
practice of biting human beings. Rats were the
cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some
time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever
caused you to be sick a day in your life? I
propose to you, any disease a rat could spread
a squirrel would equally carry.
Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity
with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
PERRIER
No.
COL. LANDA
Yet they are both rodents, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big
bushy tail, while the other has a long
repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather
look alike, don’t they?

[13]

PERRIER
It is an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.
COL. LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may be, it
makes not one bit of difference to how you
feel. If a rat were to scamper through your
door this very minute, would you offer it a
saucer of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
Probably not.
COL. LANDA
I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You
don’t really know why you don’t like them. All
you know is, you find them repulsive.
(lets the
metaphor
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat must
endure. Yet not only does he survive, he
thrives. And the reason for this is because our
little foe has an instinct for survival and
preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur,
is what a Jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he
would hide. But there are many places it would
never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the
reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in
Austria and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.
Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
(changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.
PERRIER
Please, colonel, make yourself at home.

[14]

The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped
gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues
to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.
COL. LANDA
The other mistake the German soldiers
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in wartime.
Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet
here you are.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number-one duty? Is it to fight
the Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate
victims of warfare who can
not protect themselves?
Or is your number-one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
COL. LANDA
That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this
time of war, what do you consider your numberone duty?
PERRIER
To protect my family.
COL. LANDA
Now, my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a thorough
search before I can officially cross your
family’s name off my list.

[15]

COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is, unless you have something to tell me
that will make the conducting of a search
unnecessary.
(pause)
I might add also that any information
that makes the performing of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be your family
will cease to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the rest of our
occupation of your country.
The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.
COL. LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are
you not?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
You’re sheltering them underneath your
floorboards, aren’t you?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.
The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses
are underneath.
COL. LANDA
Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,
I assume that while they’re listening, they
don’t speak English?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
I’m going to switch back to French now, and I
want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?

[16]

PERRIER
Yes.
Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,
SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and
your hospitality. I do believe our business here
is done.
The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his
men to approach the house.
COL. LANDA
Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We
shan’t be bothering your family any longer.
The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the
area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.
COL. LANDA
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,
I bid you adieu.
He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.
They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS,
SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.
With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their
gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate
silence.
UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS
The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old
SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’
bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes
for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).
COL. LANDA
hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE
moving forward between the planks in the floor.
COL. LANDA
It’s the girl. Nobody move!

[17]

VENT
is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.
COL. LANDA
as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the
cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna
is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.
SHOSANNA

COL. LANDA
changes his mind. He yells to the rat fleeing the trap, heading for
the safety of the woodpile, in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Au revoir, Shosanna!
SHOSANNA
makes it to the woods and is gone.
The S.S. colonel closes the window.
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The Nazi town car DRIVES away.

[18]

EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY
Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s
speeding away from the French farmhouse.
Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?
Out with it?
DRIVER
Why did you allow an enemy of the state to
escape?
COL. LANDA
Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much
danger, do you?
DRIVER
I suppose not.
COL. LANDA
I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,
not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteenyear-old girl and allowing
her to escape are not necessarily
the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no
shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the
massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today, it’s
highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers
to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll
probably be turned in by some neighbor.
Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or
we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from
starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll
survive. She will elude capture. She will escape
to America. She will move to New York City,
where she will be elected President of
the United States.
The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.

[19]

FADE UP
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER TWO
“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”
FADE UP
EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY
A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee,
walks down the line. He recruits the men the
Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one
defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.
The scar will never once be mentioned.
LT. ALDO
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’
together a special team.
And I need me eight soldiers.
Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers.
Now y’all might of heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little
earlier. We’re gonna be dropped
into France, dressed as civilians.
And once we’re in enemy territory, as
a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be
doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’
Nazis.
The members of the National Socialist Party
have conquered Europe through murder, torture,
intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly
what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know
’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come
down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross
five thousand miles
of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and
then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach
the Nazis
lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got
no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they
need to be destroyed.
That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find
wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.

[20]

LT. ALDO
(CON’T)
We will be cruel to the Germans,
and through our cruelty, they will
know who we are. They will find the evidence of
our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered,
and
disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us. And the Germans
will not be able to help themselves
from imagining the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands, and
our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.
And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the
Germans will talk about us.
And the Germans will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night
and their subconscious
tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it
will be thoughts of us
that it tortures them with.
He stops pacing and looks at everybody.
LT. ALDO
Sound good?
They all say:
ALL
Yes, sir!
LT. ALDO
That’s what I like to hear. But I
got a word of warning to all would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit. A debit you owe
me, personally. Every man under my command owes
me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my
scalps.
And all y’all will git me one hundred
Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
one hundred dead Nazis . . .
or you will die trying.

A huge chalet on a misty mountaintop in Bavaria.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“BAVARIA
BERCHTESGADEN
(HITLER’S PRIVATE LAIR)”
INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY
In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with
his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.
They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
HITLER
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure? They butcher my men
like they were fish bait! This pack
of filthy degenerates are doing what
the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army
couldn’t—turning soldiers of
the Third Reich into superstitious
old women!
GERMAN GENERAL
Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.
Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.
HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich,
who have brought the world to their knees, now
pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know
the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their
fear-induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear
Jew” . . . is a golem.
An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!
GENERAL
Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No
one really believes the
Bear Jew is a golem.
HITLER
Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at
will.

[22]

HITLER
(CON’T)
You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then
BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their
heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in
the sewers, for the rats of Paris
to feast!
The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and
wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.
HITLER
(disgusted)
The Bear Jew.
He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.
HITLER
Kliest!
KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
I have an order I want relayed to all German
soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as the Bear
Jew henceforth is never to be
referred to as the Bear Jew again.
We will cease to aid the Americans
any longer in their attempt to
undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you
get that, Kliest?
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?
HITLER
Who and what is a private Butz?
KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)
He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.
HITLER
Indeed I do want to see him. Thank
you for reminding me. Send him in.

[23]

CUT TO
EXT—FRENCH WOODS—DAY
CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into
the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot’s helmet, and grabs
a handful of the cadaver’s blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a
banana skin.
GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN
on their knees, hand behind their heads.
Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH:
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
Werner and I were the only ones left alive
after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the
rest removed the hair. All the Basterds wore
German scalps
tied to their belts.
CU SCALPS
hanging from belts.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
They not only took valuables . . .
WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
rings, weapons, an iron cross, and somebody digging out a gold
tooth with a knife, being removed from dead Germans.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They also took their identification
papers . . .
CU IDENTIFICATION PAPERS
taken from the inside pocket of a dead German’s uniform.
BASTERD PFC. UTIVICH
flips through the I.D. papers till he gets to the page that
contains the German soldier’s name, statistics, and photo.

Sigfried Muller.

[24]

PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They then removed their boots . . .
CU GERMAN COMBAT BOOTS
laces untied . . . boots pulled off . . .
SOCKS
removed, revealing dead bare feet . . .
BASTERDS
tossing the boots off a hill.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
Throwing them away from the bodies . . .
DEAD GERMANS
scalps removed from their heads, pink bare feet . . .
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
The Basterds took their lives, their hair,
their valuables, their identity, and finally
their dignity in death.
True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally
felt in battlefield shots.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
The dogs!
He fights his frustration, then . . .
HITLER
Continue.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut
sarge over.
BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG
KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.

[25]

PFC. HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,
An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he’s ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It’s always been his belief that
only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict,
when they put him under the earth,
his dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well, Sergeant, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands
straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his
captor.
SGT. RACHTMAN
(ENGLISH)
Sgt. Werner Rachtman.
Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.
LT. ALDO
Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.
You know what sit down means, Werner?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Then sit down.

[26]

The German sergeant does.
LT. ALDO
How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta couple fellas
can translate.
Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,
CPL. WILHELM WICKI.
LT. ALDO
Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck
outta Salzberg while the
gettin’ was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give
y’all what for.
Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd,
in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.
LT. ALDO
And another one over there you
might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of ’em?
The two German sergeants look at each other.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army’s heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.
NARRATOR (VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).
NARRATOR (VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen
Gestapo officers, mostly
majors.
WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

[27]

NARRATOR (VO)
Instead of putting him up against
a wall, the High Command decided to
send him back to Berlin, to be made
an example of.
Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
prison convoy, en route to Berlin.
NARRATOR (VO)
Needless to say, once the Basterds
heard about him, he never got there.
EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY
The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains,
stares back at them.
LT. ALDO
Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?
Hugo nods.
LT. ALDO
I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are
the Basterds. Ever heard of us?
Hugo nods his head, yes.
LT. ALDO
We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your
work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think
you show great talent, and I pride myself on
havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your
status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We
all came here to see if you wanna go pro?
BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.
LT. ALDO
Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who we
are?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Aldo the Apache.
The circle of Basterds giggle.

[28]

LT. ADLO
Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably
heard we ain’t in the
prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’
Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.
The Basterds laugh.
LT. ALDO
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill ya or let ya
go. Now whether or not you gonna
leave this circle alive depends
entirely on you.
Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front
of his prisoner.
LT. ALDO
Up the road a piece, there’s a
orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another
kraut patrol fuckin’ around
here somewhere. Now if that patrol
were to have any crack shots, that orchard
would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you
ever wanna eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
gotta show me on this map where
they are, you gotta tell me how many they are,
and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery they carrying
with ’em.
SGT. RACHTMAN
You can’t expect me to divulge information that
would put German
lives in danger.
LT. ALDO
Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong.
Because that’s exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hidin’
in trees. And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me, right now.
Now take your finger and point out
on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how
many’s comin’, and what they brought to play
with.
Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
inch the German hero facing death.

[29]

SGT. WERNER
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.
LT. ALDO
You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?
WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle.
He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones
with a baseball bat.
Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.
LT. ALDO
That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know
him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now
if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear
Jew?
SGT. RACHTMAN
I heard.
LT. ALDO
What did you hear?
SGT. RACHTMAN
He beats German soldiers with a club.
LT. ALDO
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat,
what he does.
SGT. DONOWITZ
back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
rock soaring into the atmosphere.
LT. ALDO
Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one
last goddamn time, and if you still
“respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew
over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of
his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with
it.
Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger
and point out on this map
what I want to know.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Fuck you and your Jew dogs.

[30]

Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:
LT. ALDO
Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled
ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat
Nazis to death is the closest
we ever get to goin’ to the movies.
(YELLING)
DONNY!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He turns to the CAMERA and yells:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Yeah?
LT. ALDO
Got a German here wants to die for his country.
Oblige him.
SGT. DONNY DONOWITZ
bat over his shoulder, smiles.
CUT TO
INT—BARBER SHOP (BOSTON)—DAY
Donny, cutting heads, in his pop’s barber shop, in Boston.
DONNY
. . . ya got the goddamn, fuckin’ Germans,
declaring open season on Jews in
Europe, and I’m suppose to fly to the fuckin’
Philippines and fight a bunch
of fuckin’ Japs—not me, pal.
If we just go in this against the Japs,
the whole U.S. of fuckin A can go take a
running jump at the moon.
HEAD
You know, they got a word for what you’re
sayin’ Donny. It’s called treason.
DONNY
Hey, stick your treason up your poop hole. If
I’m gonna kill my fellow man
in the name of liberty, that fellow
man will be German.

[31]

INT—SPORTING GOODS STORE—DAY
MR. GOOROWITZ’S sporting goods shop in Donny’s Jewish Boston
neighborhood. Donny walks in.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Hello, Donny. How are you?
DONNY
Ah, just dandy, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Your mother, your father—everything
good there?
DONNY
They’re just fine. I’m shippin’ off next week.
The store proprietor extends his hand to the young man.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Good for you, son. Kill one of those Nazi
basterds for me, will ya?
DONNY
That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
What can I do you for, Donny?
DONNY
I need a baseball bat.
The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny
starts going through them without saying anything.
Mr. Goorowitz watches.
MR. GOOROWITZ
You gettin’ your little brother a present
before you ship out?
Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:
DONNY
No.
Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.
DONNY
Can I try this one on for size, outside?

[32]

Extending his arm:
MR. GOOROWITZ
Be my guest.
The phone rings.
MR. GOOROWITZ
I’ll get that. You go right ahead.
The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a
conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.
Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him
clearly through the store’s big picture window.
However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny
to speak with his mother.
Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming
beating somebody to death with it. Then
he starts yelling:
DONNY
Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like
fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews?
The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !
Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into
the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.
DONNY
Is this the heaviest ya got?
CUT TO
INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY
Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston
neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
peering out at the young man.
OLD WOMAN
How can I help you?
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
State your business, young man.

[33]

DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.
My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on
Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?
DONNY
All my life.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?
DONNY
May I have a word with you?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What about?
DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
young man.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?
INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY
Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair,
holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.
DONNY
(sipping tea)
Very good.
MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table
and begins:
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones
over in Europe who you’re concerned for?

[34]

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger
such a personal question?
DONNY
Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make
it right.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?
He holds up his bat.
DONNY
With this.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do with that
toy?
DONNY
I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.
She takes another sip of tea.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together.
Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of
service?
DONNY
I’m going through the neighborhood.
If you have any loved ones in Europe whose
safety you fear for, I’d like
you to write their name on my bat.
BACK TO BASTERDS
Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .
PVT. BUTZ
watches all this . . .
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING,
WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real basterd, Donny.

[35]

DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will
join you on this journey.
She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:
He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket.
The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.
DONNY
You get that for killing jews?
SGT RACHTMAN
Bravery.
Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.
The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it
down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
the Basterds.
PVT. BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him:
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was
you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.
A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.
LT. ALDO
You wanna live?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, sir.
LT. ALDO
Point out on this map the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.

[36]

PVT. BUTZ
This area here.
LT. ALDO
How many?
PVT. BUTZ
Maybe twelve.
LT. ALDO
What kind of artillery?
PVT BUTZ
They have a machine gun dug in here pointing
north.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
How did you survive this ordeal?
WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the
Führer, but he seems okay with it.
PVT. BUTZ
They let me go.
FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.
LT. ALDO
Now, when you report what happened here,
you can’t tell ’em you told us what you
told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.
HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one
word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got away.
Not one more word.
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
Pause.
HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the other
survivors?

[37]

PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.
LT. ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the
war? When you get back
home, what ’cha gonna do?
PVT. BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her
before.
LT. ALDO
Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going
to take off your uniform?
PVT. BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to
burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he
thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like
that. You see, we like our Nazis
in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just
like that.
(snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody
gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don’t sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you
can’t take off.
BACK TO HITLER
Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He
moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HANDCARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.
BACK TO BASTERDS
BUTZ’S POV
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the
Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.

[38]

SGT. DONOWITZ
You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty
good at that.
LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t
cha? Practice.
FADE TO BLACK
OVER BLACK
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER THREE
“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen.
We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theater.
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and
wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.
We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German
omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.
The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German
dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .
UNTIL . . .
The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the
movie.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“SHOSANNA DREYFUS
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE
OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”
We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their
coats and file out.

[39]

EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS
OFF the marquee’s lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”
EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the
film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.
INT—AUDITORIUM
CU SHOSANNA
Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.
The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.
Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN
ENGLISH.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re
closed for the evening, I must assume you want
something. What can I do for you?
SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?
MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather you’re not a nurse?
SHOSANNA
No.
MADAME MIMIEUX
But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a
clever disguise. Where is your family?
SHOSANNA
Murdered.

[40]

MADAME MIMIEUX
So you’re a war orphan?
SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—
MADAME MIMIEUX
—Is this a sad story?
SHOSANNA.
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in
Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine.
Don’t bore me with yours.
SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?
MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says:
SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film.
MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.
Of course I can operate them.
SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.
FLASH ON:
CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors . . .
BACK TO SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that
show the film. It’s only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.

[41]

MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who’ve been put up
against a wall and machinegunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I
have no intention of being unlucky number
seven. How long have
you been in Paris?
SHOSANNA
A week and a few days.
MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?
SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I’m forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?
SHOSANNA
Cold.
MADAME MIMIEUX
(laughs)
I can imagine.
SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can’t.
Pause.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.
Thinks . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You
want me to teach you, in order to work here, in
order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is
that correct?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
What’s your name?
SHOSANNA
Shosanna.

[42]

MADAME MIMIEUX
I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.
DISSOLVE TO
TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.
ABOVE IT READS:
“1944
PARIS”
THEN . . .
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD
at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s
projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
month is JUNE . . .
The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.
A lyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This
will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”
A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .
SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. Onscreen LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies
horizontal as an icicle drips on her head in the old
German film “The White Hell of Pitz Palu.”
The FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-righthand corner of the FRAME (that tells the projectionist
to get ready).

[43]

As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands
ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .
WHEN . . .
SILVER SCREEN
the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the
one).
SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices. Either you
could show new German propaganda films, produced
under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at
her from below.

[44]

SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a
film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of
“The Kid,” superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use an M,
an A, and an X?
SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .
GERMAN SOLDIER
Is it yours?
SHOSANNA
Do I own it?
GERMAN SOLDIER
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl such as yourself own a
cinema?
Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts
at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

[45]

SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hosting a German night.
SHOSANNA
I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you choose the German films yourself?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl
mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s
nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of
Riefenstahl.
SHOSANNA
“Admire” would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings toward
Fräulein Riefenstahl.
GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t
you? That’s why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
private.
SHOSANNA
I’m French. We respect directors
in our country.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.
SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
You’re not finished?

[46]

SHOSANNA
I’ll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?
SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.
COL. LANDA
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very
pretty name.
SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.
She gives no response.
GERMAN SOLDIER
It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow
cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfewimposed night.
She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her.
After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody
who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.
EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting
up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.
FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist,
Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

[47]

MADAME MIMIEUX
If I ever see you light up a cigarette in my
cinema again, I’ll turn you in to the Nazis, do
you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing an open flame into my cinema,
you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish
boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think
the highest priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to
the ground, that’s what!
In my collection, I have over three hundred and
fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not
only immensely flammable but highy unstable.
And should they catch fire, they burn three
times faster than paper. If that happens . . .
POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody
burned alive. If I ever
see you with an open flame in my cinema again,
I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you
myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a
curfew pass.
Do you understand me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.
BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.
MARCEL
Are you well?

[48]

SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette
without hearing Madame’s
voice yelling at me. That’s why I
do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.
MARCEL
We both miss her.
SHOSANNA
I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.
INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine when the young German soldier from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French
girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over
to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
May I join you?
SHOSANNA
Look, Fredrick—
FREDRICK
(smiling)
—You remember my name?
SHOSANNA
Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow—
FREDRICK
—Merci.
SHOSANNA
You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop
pestering me.
FREDRICK
I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to
be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.
SHOSANNA
I don’t wish to be your friend.

[49]

FREDRICK
Why not?
SHOSANNA
Don’t act like an infant. You know why.
FREDRICK
I’m more than just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-Germanspeaking members of the movie’s audience can understand.
He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna’s eyes narrow.
SHOSANNA
Who are you?
FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
You’re not just a German soldier. Are you
somebody’s son?
FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.
SHOSANNA
Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are
you, Hitler’s nephew?
He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:
FREDRICK
Yes.
SHOSANNA
Really?
FREDRICK
No, not really. I’m just teasing you.
She leans back, annoyed.
SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German movie
star?

[50]

FREDRICK
Not exactly.
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I
asked if you were a movie star. The answer to
that question is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.
FREDRICK
When you said that just now, you reminded me of
my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.
FREDRICK
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family-operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very
much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a
German uniform.
SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?
FREDRICK
All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the
bossiest.
SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?
FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My father’s motto: “If at first
you don’t succeed, quit.” The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It’s why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them
and a little homesick at the same time.
SHOSANNA
Is your cinema still operating?
FREDRICK
Oui.
SHOSANNA
What’s it called?

[51]

FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.
SHOSANNA
How has it done during the war?
FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.
SHOSANNA
No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a
curfew.
FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) Not since before the war.
FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that would
help you out?
SHOSANNA
Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredrick’s autograph, and he signs it for
them. One of the French girls says, in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that’s it, she thinks.
SHOSANNA
So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?
FREDRICK
Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.
SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.
FREDRICK
I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers
in World War Two . . . so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
SHOSANNA
Wow.

[52]

FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled-off city in Russia. It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a bird’s nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.
SHOSANNA
What’s a bird’s nest?
FREDRICK
A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a
bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a
three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very
advantageous for marksmen.
SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill?
FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.
(beat)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the second
day. Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received a lot of
attention in Germany. That’s why they all
recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant
York.
SHOSANNA
Maybe they’ll make a film about
your exploits.
FREDRICK
Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and
guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I
did. They have posters for it in kiosks all
over Paris. That’s another reason for all the
attention.
SHOSANNA
“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride”
is starring you?
FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?
SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?

[53]

FREDRICK
Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my
pictures taken with different German
luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to
premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in
the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He’s telling anybody who will listen that
when “Nation’s Pride” is released
I’ll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch.
However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,”
like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of
things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises and says:
SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I
hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.
EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY
It’s the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.
WHEN . . .
. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of
the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

[54]

GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema.
In French the driver asks Shosanna:
DRIVER
Is this your cinema?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.
DRIVER
Come down, please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to
get in.
SHOSANNA
I don’t understand. What have I done?
DRIVER
(to major)
She wants to know what she’s done?
GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she’s done anything?
DRIVER
Who says you’ve done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant
manner.
SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about, and
where do you propose to take me?
The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German:

[55]

GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris
streets.
WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.
EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY
She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the
Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it:
Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s
Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and
mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.
TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit
together in another chair at the table.
We join the in mid-conversation:
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
GOEBBELS
—it’s only the offspring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured
in Negro sweat.
Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major.
Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not
you’d accept my invitation.

[56]

SHOSANNA
Invitation?
THEN . . .
. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:
GOEBBELS (OS)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.
FREDRICK
Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is
somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister
formally.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you
to the minister of propaganda, the leader of
the entire German film industry, and now I’m an
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.
GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite
of tiramisu.
They all laugh.
Frederick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.

[57]

NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:
NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s
French interpreter.
She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French
actress to appear in his films . . . . .
FLASH ON
FRENCH CLIP
from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG
GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my
heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:
“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)
FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet
bed.
NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act
in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGYSTYLE.
FRANCESCA
(animal-like)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!
BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.
FRANCESCA
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.

[58]

FREDRICK
And you’ve met the major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn’t introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your
service, Mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me. Have a seat.
The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered
poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small carafe on the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.
GOEBBELS
Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.
GOEBBELS
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch
with my star . . .
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Little do I know he’s become
the toast of Paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets . . .

[59]

GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, days,
to see me. For the Führer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So finally, I’m granted an audience
with the young private, and he spends the
entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts—
FREDRICK
Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed
her yet.
GOEBBELS
Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m
sure she’s figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French:
FRANCESCA
What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is
Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s
film premiere and change the venue to your
cinema.
Zoller reacts.
FRANCESCA
(FRENCH to Zoller)
What?
FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.
FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.

[60]

GOEBBELS
(GERMAN to Francesca)
What’s the issue?
FRANCESCA
The young soldier wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:
GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GOEBBELS
How many?
SHOSANNA
Three.
GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?
SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.
GOEBBELS
That’s almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn’t want to indulge every
two-faced French bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive. You’re not trying to fill
the house, they’re fighting for seats.

[61]

FREDRICK
(CON’T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German military, the
High Command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by
the exploits onscreen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:
GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I’ve created
a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When
the war’s over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.
GOEBBELS
Well, Private, though it is true
I’m inclined to indulge you anything,
I must watch a film in this young
lady’s cinema before I can say
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So, young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight and have
a private screening for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks . . .
SHOSANNA
My cinema, on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks . . . ?

[62]

SHOSANNA
I draw an older German audience in
my cinema that appreciates the
nostalgia of an earlier time.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans
are looking forward, not backward.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create will not
only be the cinema of Europe, but
the world’s only alternative to the degenerate
Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is
quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.
GOEBBELS
So it would appear. Unfortunately
for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says:
FREDRICK
Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”?
I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it.
And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That’s a great idea.
Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.
GOEBBELS
Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,”
“Lucky Kids.” When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not
only that, I
wouldn’t be surprised if sixty
years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids”
that I’m the most remembered for.
I know it doesn’t seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I’ll have a print sent
over to the Fräulein’s cinema.
We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.

[63]

As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.
GOEBBELS
Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady
in question.
The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the
first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of
the S.S. He’ll be running security
for the premiere.
CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French:
COL. LANDA
Charmed, Mademoiselle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”
The table laughs.
GOEBBELS
Oh, Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Führer said about Hans?
FRANCESCA
What thing?
GOEBBELS
You know, you were there. It was a
funny thing the Führer said,
about Hans . . . something about a pig?
Francesca’s memory is jogged.
FRANCESCA
Oh, yes, of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.

[64]

GOEBBELS
Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So
the Führer said he wouldn’t be
surprised if Hans weren’t rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the playpen.
FRANCESCA
That’s what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.
COL. LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big, hearty laugh around the table.
GOEBBELS
Do you have an engagement tonight?
COL. LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do—
GOEBBELS
—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s
cinema tonight to view
“Lucky Kids.”
COL. LANDA
Splendid.
Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino,
interrupts:
FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to
his next appointment.
GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .
As Col. Landa stands, he says:
COL. LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m
afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle
Mimieux.

[65]

Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?
COL. LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like
a soldier questioning the order of a colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth, Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation precedes
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?
GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s
simply smitten. And he’s correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make
their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.
COL. LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue’s property owner.
FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream
and walk along the Seine another
time. Right now, allow Col. Landa
to do his job.
Everybody says their farewells.
Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s
French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at
French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was
simply an interrogation technique.

[66]

They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?
SHOSANNA
No.
COL. LANDA
It’s not so terrible. So how is it
the young private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.
COL. LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last
time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least . . . disconcerting.
The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the
side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to
your secrets.
The waiter exits.
COL. LANDA
So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain . . . ?
SHOSANNA
(anxiously)
Up until a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits. To me, the private
was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke
a few times, but—
COL. LANDA
—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a
simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The strudel arrives.
The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:

[67]

COL. LANDA
I apologize. I forgot to order the
crème fraîche.
WAITER
One moment.
He exits.
COL. LANDA
(referring to
the crème.)
Wait for the crème
(back to
business)
So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
COL. LANDA
So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen that a young lady
such as yourself comes to own a
cinema?
The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.
The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking
up his fork, he says:
COL. LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her
lead.
COL. LANDA
(mouthful
of strudel)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.
COL. LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(back to
business)
So you were explaining the origin of your
cinema ownership?

[68]

SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle—
Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.
COL. LANDA
—What are their names?
SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.
COL. LANDA
Where are they now?
SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.
COL. LANDA
Pity . . . Continue.
SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.
COL. LANDA
Regrettable.
(respectful
pause)
It’s come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ. Is that true?
SHOSANNA
Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He
worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He’s the only other one who works
with me.
COL. LANDA
Doing what?
SHOSANNA
Projectionist.
COL. LANDA
Is he any good?
SHOSANNA
The best.

[69]

COL. LANDA
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
SHOSANNA
Of course I can.
COL. LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want
the success or failure of his illustrious
evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass that we hold this event
at your venue—talented, no doubt,
as your negro may be—you will
operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?
As if she has any say.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows
suit.
COL. LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is quite
smitten with you?
SHOSANNA
Private Zoller’s feelings for me
aren’t of a romantic nature.
COL. LANDA
Mademoiselle . . . ?
SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.
COL. LANDA
That doesn’t mean his feelings
aren’t romantic.
SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.

[70]

COL. LANDA
It’s sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Cigarette?
SHOSANNA
No, thank you.
COL. LANDA
Do you smoke?
SHOSANNA
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not
French, they’re German.
I hope you’re not nationalist about
your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a
sin against nicotine.
She takes one but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deeply and says:
COL. LANDA
I did have something else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh,
well, must not have been important.
Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts
on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting
Shosanna, and says:
COL. LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he’s gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and
ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man who
exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her
feet.

[71]

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”
We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.
CU GOEBBELS
watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.
CU FRANCESCA
laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.
CU TWO BLACK POODLES
pantingly watching the screen.
CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
smiling, smoking a German cigarette.
CU COL LANDA
smoking a German cigarette, amused.
CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
truly enjoying himself.
CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s
Frank Capra copy “Lucky
Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.
NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose
its minister of
propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew
hunter, all in one fell swoop.
She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s
chuckling at the German comedy.
NARRATOR (VO)
But then that thought . . .
. . . led Shosanna
To a crazy idea.
The idea flashes on her face.
Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.
Zoller looks over at her. Happy.
She’s enjoying the movie.

[72]

SILVER SCREEN
“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.
The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.
The lights go up.
Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.
NARRATOR (VO)
The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete
success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the
venue changed
to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had
an idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:
GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your cinema
has real respect, almost churchlike.
Not to say we couldn’t spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there’s a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. We’re going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.
MONTAGE
We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous
crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge,
heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium,
which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian
B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”
SHOSANNA
watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in
disbelief.

[73]

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS
in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly
escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.
NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy . . .
We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.
NARRATOR (VO)
None more so than Fredrick Zoller.
She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into
Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look
like grotesque Nazi caricatures.
The Nazis are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down
at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
SHOSANNA
It looks like we’re supposed to have
a Nazi premiere.
MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to
do?
SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.
MARCEL
About what?
SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.
MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna
has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

[74]

SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching that Boche
(said in
English)
Capra-corn abomination,
(back to
French)
I got an idea.
MARCEL
I’m confused. What are we talking
about?
SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.
MARCEL
I’m not talking about that. You’re talking
about that.
SHOSANNA
No, we’re talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.
MARCEL
Shosanna—
SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we
wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons, you and I could
physically accomplish that, no?
MARCEL
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty
nitrate film print collection,
we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?
MARCEL
You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?
SHOSANNA
Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.

[75]

SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which
I am, we both know
you’re not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both
caresses and grips her lovely neck.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And you’re the only person on this earth I can
trust.
She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now
face to face.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the
filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I
know the film
camera does. How about the sound recorder?
MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a café last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?
SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazis.
She gives him a deep French kiss.
FADE TO BLACK
BLACK FRAME

[76]

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FOUR
“OPERATION KINO”
FADE OFF
INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors
that serve as an entrance to the room.
MILITARY ATTACHÉ
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,
a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of
Bel Ami” years).
Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind
GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the
Damned”).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.
The lieutenant was not expecting him.
Hicox salutes the general.
LT. HICOX
Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.
GEN. FENECH
(salutes back)
General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?
Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment
of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox
knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t
there.
LT. HICOX
If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I
could drink a scotch and
plain water.

[77]

GEN. FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like
a good chap,
will you? Bar’s in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.
LT. HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?
GEN. FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you’ve run three
undercover commando operations in Germany and
German-occupied
territories? Frankfurt, Holland,
and Norway, to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:
LT. HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?
LT. HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
GEN. FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends . . .
LT. HICOX
I’m a film critic.
GEN. FENECH
List your accomplishments?
LT. HICOX
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews
and articles for a publication called “Films
and Filmmakers.”
As well as our sister publication.

[78]

GEN. FENECH
What’s that called?
LT. HICOX
“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had
two books published.
GEN. FENECH
Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What
are their titles?
LT. HICOX
The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the
Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema
in the Twenties.”
And the second one was called . . .
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s
whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.
LT. HICOX
“Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.”
It’s a subtextual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G. W. Pabst.
He hands the general his whiskey.
LT. HICOX
What should we drink to, sir?
GEN. FENECH
(thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.
LT. HICOX
All the way down, sir.
CLINK.
GEN. FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema under the
Third Reich?
LT. HICOX
Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.
GEN. FENECH
Explain it to me.

[79]

LT. HICOX
Pardon, sir?
GEN. FENECH
This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to
me UFA, under Goebbels?
LT. HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he’s
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema—an alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the twenties and
the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:
CHURCHILL
How’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?
CHURCHILL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to, say,
. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t
be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe
Goebbels sees himself closer to David O.
Selznick.
Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:
CHURCHILL
Brief him.
GEN. FENECH
Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to
brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from
now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—

[80]

LT. HICOX
—What film, sir?
The general has to resort to peeking at his file.
GEN. FENECH
The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”
LT. HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?
GEN. FENECH
We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what
the film that night
will be about.
LT. HICOX
But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?
GEN. FENECH
Yes.
LT. HICOX
I can tell you what it’s about.
It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He’s the German Sargeant York.
Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.
GEN. FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion
will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most
of the German High Command, including all the
high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the
Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi
propaganda-film industry.
LT. HICOX
The master race at play, aye?
GEN. FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation
Kino . . . Blow up the basket.
LT. HICOX
(reciting a
poem)
. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone
from this earth. Jolly good, sir.

[81]

GEN. FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist. The Germans call them “the
Basterds.”
LT. HICOX
“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.
GEN. FENECH
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lieutenant Aldo Raine. The
Germans call him “Aldo the Apache.”
LT. HICOX
Why do they call him that?
GEN. FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the scalps of
the Nazi dead.
LT. HICOX
Scalps, sir?
GEN. FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.
GEN. FENECH
Like a red Injun.
LT. HICOX
Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird,
isn’t he?
GEN. FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But
you’ve heard the
expression “It takes a thief.”
LT. HICOX
Indeed.
Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.

[82]

GEN. FENECH
You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four
kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will
be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a
little village called Nadine.
(He points it out
on the map.)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there’s a tavern called
La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous
with our double agent, and she’ll take it from
there. She’s the one who’s
going to get you into the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two Germanborn members of the Basterds. She’s
also made all the other arrangements you’re
going to need.
LT. HICOX
How will I know her?
GEN. FENECH
I suspect that won’t be too much
trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von
Hammersmark.
LT. HICOX
Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star
is working for England?
GEN. FENECH
For the last two years now. One could even say
Operation Kino was her brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks:
CHURCHILL
Extraordinary woman.
LT. HICOX
Quite.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She’ll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?
LT. HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.

[83]

EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema
literally making a movie.
Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low, looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.
MARCEL
We need a sync mark.
SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?
MARCEL
An action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.
SHOSANNA
How do we do that?
MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.
MARCEL
In frame, imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.
MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:
SHOSANNA
Ready.
MARCEL
Action.
WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .

[84]

THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE
LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.
MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop
that footage. How do we get
a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?
MARCEL
Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,
took care of all the experimental filmmakers.
But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what you’re talking about. If the
Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.
SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you either eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to
obliterate the Nazis,
we have to use their tactics.
MARCEL
What does that mean?
SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print. And we
make them do it or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway or they’ll turn us in.
MARCEL
Would you do that?
SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.

[85]

INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT
A old mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING
at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.
SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat
against the tabletop.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.
SHOSANNA
You either do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your
collaborating skull.
GASPAR
I’m not a collaborator!
SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do
his wife and children
know you?
MARCEL
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we’ll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .
SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!
CUT TO
GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside
the shop window, it’s morning.

[86]

INT—PROJECTION ROOM
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s
life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.
Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the
rewinds . . .
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s
film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.
BLACK FRAME
FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out
front that reads “La Louisiane.”
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“The village of
Nadine, France”
TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in
an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.
LT. ALDO
You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a
fuckin’ basement.
LT. HICOX
I didn’t know.
LT. ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?
LT. HICOX
It is a tavern.

[87]

LT. ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin’ in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being
you’re fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s
uniform.
WICKI
What if we go in there and she’s
not even there?
LT. HICOX
We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.
She’ll make the rendezvous.
WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray
uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening
chapter is dead.
Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the
room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.
Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .
Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz, right?
STIGLITZ
That’s right, sir.
He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather
strap.
LT. HICOX
I hear you’re pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade.
Stiglitz doesn’t answer.
LT. HICOX
You know, we’re not looking for
trouble right now. We’re simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I’m wrong and things prove
eventful, I need to know we can all remain
calm.

[88]

The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and
looks up at the limey lieutenant.
STIGLITZ
I don’t look calm to you?
LT. HICOX
Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:
LT. HICOX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.
LT. ALDO
Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious
type?
LT. HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.
LT. ALDO
So y’all git in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
LT. HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans or French, for that matter—
escape from that basement.
If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Donny chimes in:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?
LT. HICOX
She chose the spot.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Well, isn’t that just dandy?

[89]

LT. HICOX
Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s
just an actress.
LT. ALDO
Ya don’t got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don’t want to
fight in a basement.
LT. HICOX
She wasn’t picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on
Louisiana two o’clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.
LT. HICOX
Shit.
Sgt. Donowitz chides him:
SGT. DONOWITZ
So what do you think your Fräulein
von Hammer—
LT. HICOX
—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not
supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.
STIGLITZ
If we’re going, let’s go.
He sheaths the dagger.
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task.
Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .

[90]

INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging
basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the
only other space in the little tavern is taken
up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both
halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the
two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.
FIVE NAZIS
ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a
powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.
The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of
the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the
nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora.
The game they’re playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);
FEMALE SGT #2: (BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);
GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5:
(WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
WINNETOU
. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN
Yes, you are!
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.

[91]

EDGAR WALLACE
Well, if he’s so American, how come
he’s never been translated into
English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be
American, but he’s not
an American creation. In fact, he’s something
very different.
WINNETOU
Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from
the past. I’m American, and that’s
controversial.
BRIDGET/GENGUS
No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of
the author has nothing to do with
the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish.
So, yes, this character was born in
America.
WINNETOU
Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife,
would she be called a squaw?
He’s got it.
The table laughs.
THE TABLE
YES!
WINNETOU
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
THE TABLE
Yes!
WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
THE TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German
officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement
tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re
too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No
doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark
sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

[92]

BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies. I will join you
in moments. I’m finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.
LT. HICOX
No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Take your time. Enjoy yourself.
BRIDGET
(to Winnetou)
So who are you?
WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card
off his forehead.
The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of
the game).
Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.
MATA HARI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends
came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the movies?
BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that
at all.
MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now. Did they
teach you how to do a double take in the
movies?
BRIDGET
Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that
difficult.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The table heartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, double take.
The table loves it.

[93]

MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double
take.
EDGAR WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.
HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t
understand.
THEN . . .
Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the
table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.
BRIDGET
Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The
gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey.
The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more
champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back
behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
LT. HICOX
I thought this place was supposed to have more
French than Germans?
BRIDGET
Normally that’s true. The sergeant over there’s
wife just had a baby. His commanding officer
gave him and his
mates the night off to celebrate.
WICKI
We should leave.

[94]

BRIDGET
No, we should stay. For one drink at least.
I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would
look strange if we left before we had a drink.
LT. HICOX
She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your
booze.
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy
game. She tells them her person must be French or she
won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:
NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE
BRIDGET
There’s been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
LT. HICOX
Why?
BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a
problem. The cinema
it’s been changed to is considerably smaller
than The Ritz. So whatever materials you
brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective
here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to overreact.
The Führer will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.
Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.

[95]

BACK TO THE BASTERDS
BRIDGET
(to Hicox)
You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say
you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s
“Tiefland.” It’s the
one German production not under Goebbels’
control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a
Goebbels film affair.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily,
at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in
the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and
head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and
Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have
to speak . . .
Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her
to cool it.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking,
could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?
BRIDGET
I’d love to, Wilhelm.
(to the table)
This handsome happy sergeant just became a
father today.
The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.
The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his
superior officers.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you. Heil Hitler.
He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil
Hitler.”
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .
BRIDGET
So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this
progeny yet?

[96]

SGT. POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, Fräulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.
STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sergeant.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to
ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side “The Blue Max.”
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick,
applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured
item to the young officer.
BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not
know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in
Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no
Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his
table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you
to France?

[97]

Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been
exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.
LT. HICOX
None of your business, Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the fräulein with your drunken, boorish
behavior, but you have worn out your welcome
with me.
The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.
LT. HICOX
Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man.
This is an officers’ table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fräulein and
rejoin your table.
The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very
unusual.
The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two Germanborn imposters spring into action.
WICKI
Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to
speak to a superior officer with
such impertinence!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:
STIGLITZ
I’m making YOU . . .
(pointing at
Winnetou)
. . . and YOU . . .
(pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
. . . responsible for him.
(pointing at
Sgt. Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or
he’ll spend Max’s first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!

[98]

The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .
WHEN . . .
A GERMAN VOICE rings out:
GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:
MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young, newly christened father, I to
have an acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Wicki jumps in:
WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—I wasn’t speaking to you,
Lieutenant Saltzberg,
(turning to
Stiglitz)
or you either, Lieutenant Berlin.
(looking at
Hicox)
I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.
The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the
imposter’s table.
Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.
LT. HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Pitz Palu.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?
LT. HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.

[99]

LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch
scene?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes, I do.
LT. HICOX
In that scene were myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is
so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a
closeup.
As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette
holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her
she says:
BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch
for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he
was in the film, and his brother is far more
handsome than he.
The imposters laugh.
Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table
begins playing their game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?
BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki.
The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that’s the source of your bizarre accent?
Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here, Captain?
LT. HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fräulein?

[100]

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle . . . chuckle
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. You’re obviously not
stationed in France, or I’d know who
you are.
LT. HICOX
You know every German in France?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Worth knowing.
LT. HICOX
Well, therein lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?
LT. HICOX
Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as
the fräulein’s escort.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You’re the fräulein’s escort?
LT. HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
BRIDGET
The captain is my date, but all three are my
guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a
long time. Longer than
an actress would care to admit.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.
BRIDGET
I’ll drink to that.

[101]

They cheers.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE
They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.
BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game they’re playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t
join them, because you’re quite right, Captain,
officers and enlisted men shouldn’t
fraternize. But seeing as we’re all
officers here,
(bowing to
Bridget)
. . . and sophisticated lady friends of
officers, what say we play the game?
Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better)
interrupts him:
BRIDGET
Okay, one game.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Wunderbar.
The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card. Real
or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance,
you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his fingers.)
Eric! More pens.
(back to the players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When
you finish writing, put the card face down on
the table and move it to the person to your
left. The person to your right will move their
card in
front of you. You pick up the card without
looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on
your forehead, like so.
He demonstrates.

[102]

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(con’t)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess
who you are . . .
As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED
FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a
GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.
The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into
it.
The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The five players write their names . . .
Then move their cards to the left . . .
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .
MAJOR
HELLSTROM
is
KING
KONG

BRIDGET
VON HAMMERSMARK
is
G.W.
PABST

WILHELM
WICKI
is
BULLDOG
DRUMMOND

ARCHIE
HICOX
is
BRIGITTE
HELM

MAJ. KING KONG
I’ll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.
BRIDGET
No.
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I an American?
They laugh—but then Wicki says:
WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to—

HUGO
STIGLITZ
is
MARCO
POLO

[103]

BRIDGET
Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born
in America.
MAJ. KING KONG
So . . . I visited America, aye?
The table says, “Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Was this visit . . . fortuitous?
WICKI
Not for you.
MAJ. KING KONG
. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one
would call exotic?
The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.
MAJ. KING KONG
Hummm. That could be either a reference to the
jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first
instinct take over and ask, am I from the
jungle?
The table says, “Yes, you are.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask
whether you’re real or fictitious.
I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t
ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the
jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not
fortuitous to me, but the implication is that
it was to somebody else. When I went from the
jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?
“Yes.”

[104]

MAJ. KING KONG
When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed
in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The table says, “No.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Well, then, I must be King Kong.
He throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to
finish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who’s next?
LT. HICOX
Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of
us are very good friends. And the four of us
haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .
. .
Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the
fräulein considers my presence an
intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?
BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young
captain is immune to my charms.
The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation?
Then the major laughs.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.

[105]

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and
I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
(leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old
single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish
highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?
LT. HICOX
You’re most gracious, sir.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You
don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with
the swill you were drinking.
ERIC
How many glasses?
LT. HICOX
Five glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.
BRIDGET
Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.
Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric,
the owner.
LT. HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:
MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand-year Reich!
They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.
The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK under the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That’s the sound of
my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.

[106]

LT. HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you’ve just given yourself
away, captain. You’re no more German than
scotch.
LT. HICOX
Well, Major—
BRIDGET
—Major—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—Shut up, slut.
(to Hicox)
You were saying?
LT. HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a
gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
SGT. STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.
UNDER THE TABLE
We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well
as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.
SGT. STIGLITZ
And at this range, I’m a real
Fredrick Zoller.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.
LT. HICOX
What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going
to stand up and walk out that
door with us.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t think so. I’m
afraid you and I both know, no matter what
happens to anybody else in this room, the two of
us aren’t going anywhere.

[107]

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing at the table
behind him)
Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.
If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot
them too.
(pause)
Looks like little Max is going to grow up an
orphan. How sad.
BRIDGET
Then, Major, I implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops
gets me . . .
(pointing at
his heart)
. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your
whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get
any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished
spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt
scotch and says:
LT. HICOX
(ENGLISH)
Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope
you don’t mind if I go out speaking
the king’s?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
By all means, Captain.
The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi major bought him and says:
LT. HICOX
There’s a special rung in hell reserved for
people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily . . .
He downs the stuff.
LT. HICOX
(to the Nazi
major)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

[108]

He puts the glass down.
LT. HICOX
Now about this pickle we find
ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one
thing left for you to do.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz.
STIGLITZ
Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!
STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.
HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.
STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the
DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.
WICKI
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS
FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still
PLAYING THE GAME.
WINNETOU
is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.
EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each
other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS
it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the
floor.

WICKI and MATA HARI
both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is
HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the
whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI,
and THE BARMAID.
The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .
starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is
the
young German sergeant with the machine gun.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens . . .
The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s
direction . . .
No one goes through it.
What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one
inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.
The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:
GERMAN SERGEANT
You outside! Who are you? British, American,
what?
Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
We’re Americans! What are you?
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a German, you idiot!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
You speak English pretty good for a German!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I agree! So let’s talk!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, talk!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max!
We were in here drinking and celebrating!
They’re the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It’s not my fault!

[110]

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!
What’s your name, soldier?
GERMAN SERGEANT
Wilhelm!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
That’s the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!
WILHELM
They attacked us!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive
on our side?
WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:
BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)
I’m alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive
Bridget von Hammersmark.
The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at
the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Who’s that?
WILHELM
(to BRIDGET,
low)
Make a sound, whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?
WILHELM
Is the girl on your side?
Pause.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Which girl?

[111]

WILHELM
Who do you think—von Hammersmark!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Yeah, she’s ours!
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the Americans
now, huh? Now times are
bad?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Is she okay?
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(to Aldo)
She’s been shot, but she’s alive.
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we
make a deal?
WILHELM
What’s your name?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?
WILHELM
Yes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four
or five or six grenades down there and your
little war story ends here. But good fer you,
bad fer her.
You die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?
WILLI
Keep talking!

[112]

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little Max
gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy!
So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?
Willi thinks . . .
Bridget watches Willi think . . .
WILLI
Aldo?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
I’m here, Willi!
WILLI
I want to trust you . . . But how can I?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
What choice ya got?
WILLI
I could kill the girl!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But
something you need to know, so
you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t
none of us give a fuck ‘bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be
dead by then anyway, so
what’d you care? And let’s not
forget that little Katzenjammer
Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin’ you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?
WILLI
Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.
Aldo, with his hands up, says:

[113]

ALDO
Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine
gun? I thought we had a deal.
WILLI
We do have a deal. Now get the girl
and go.
ALDO
Not so fast, Willi. We only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff
ain’t trust.
WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican standoff.
ALDO
You got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades,
they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a
Mexican
standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.
WILLI
Just take that fuckin’ traitor and
go! See? Now you’re down here—
Now you get tricky—!
ALDO
—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’
tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m
too damn dumb to get tricky. But
(meaning
Hirschberg)
him and I lived up to the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it’s
your turn. No trust, no deal.
Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .
ALDO
I know you’re scared. I’m scared,
he’s scared, we’re all scared.
So what’s it gonna be, Willi?
Either we got a deal or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides . . .
He puts the machine gun down on the bar.

[114]

WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.
ALDO
Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab
her shoulder—
WHEN . . .
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s
WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain
(she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the
two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:
BRIDGET
He was an enemy soldier who knew who
I was. He couldn’t live.
INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT
An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
bed, in his bedroom . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .
. . . . . The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING . . .
and the sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .
his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a
.45 automatic to his head.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Doctor?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
What? What’s happening?
Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking,
scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Andiamo . . .

[115]

Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) toward the door . . .
INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country
house, with an examining table and medical instruments.
However, it’s obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING
dogs in them.
The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s
direction . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .
(pointing at
his leg)
. . . in leg . . . understand?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
No, no, no, I don’t speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!
The old man nods his head, yes.
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .
I take care of animals . . .
Bridget screams from the table . . .
BRIDGET
(ENGLISH)
He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!

[116]

SGT. DONOWITZ
He’s still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.
LT. ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor
. . .
Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
BANG
He SHOOTS another dog . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.
CUT TO
The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.
INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT
We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I
see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

[117]

A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.
COL. LANDA
And that one’s . . .
(pointing at
Wicki)
. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrianborn Jew who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites. They are
the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They’ve been known
to don German uniforms to ambush squads.
FLASH ON
three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German
soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet
holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:
SGT. GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
But that doesn’t look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he sees something . . .
Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two
pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.
COL. LANDA
It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody
fashionable.
AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:
SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)
Colonel, this one’s still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s
shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.

[118]

INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.
LT. ALDO
Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need
to answer a few questions.
BRIDGET
Few questions about what?
LT. ALDO
About I got three men dead back there, and why
don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck
happened?
BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo major saw it.
LT. ALDO
’Fore we get into who shot John,
Why did you invite my men to a
rendezvous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?
BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn’t see
what happened inside, the Nazis
being there must look odd.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English. It’s called
suspicious.
BRIDGET
Don’t let your imagination get the better of
you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His
commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment . . .
LT. ALDO
Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.

[119]

LT. ALDO
How did the shootin’ start?
BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away.
LT. ALDO
How did he do that?
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.
BRIDGET
This is the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would and did notice it.
LT. ALDO
Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and
everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to. What would of been
the next step?
BRIDGET
Tuxedoes. To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
have been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody
else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedoes tonight.
LT. ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?
BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.
BRIDGET
Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman
and his assistant.

[120]

LT. ALDO
Can you still get us into that
premiere?
BRIDGET
Can you speak German better than your friends?
No. Have I been shot? Yes.
I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up
the red carpet anytime
soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.
(pause)
However, there’s something you don’t know.
There’s been two recent developments regarding
Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue.
LT. ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not
very Germanic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?
BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.
LT. ALDO
Which is?
FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler,
aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner
with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
THE FUHRER
(GERMAN)
I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to
your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the
weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous
for us. And I’m beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.
BACK TO BRIDGET
BRIDGET
The Führer’s attending the premiere.

[121]

Donny breaks the team’s silence:
SGT. DONOWITZ
What?
LT. ALDO
When the hell did this happen?
BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Führer’s attendance, four days
ago.
LT. ALDO
And how come London don’t know
nothing about that?
BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London knows, it
learned from me. If I
don’t know, London doesn’t know.
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s
coming to Paris.
SGT. DONOWITZ
FUCK A DUCK!
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.
BRIDGET
What are you thinking?
LT. ALDO
I’m thinking getting a wack at
plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.
BRIDGET
What’s that supposed to mean?
LT. ALDO
It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.
BRIDGET
I’m going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye, acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?

[122]

LT. ALDO
The doggie doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your
gam. Then he’s gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
“how I broke my leg mountain climbing” story.
That’s German, ain’t it?
Y’all like climbin’ mountains,
don’t cha?
BRIDGET
I don’t. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.
LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it’s comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.
BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a
wall, it won’t hurt
so much.
(changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
Americans speak any other language
than English?
HIRSCHBERG
Other than Yiddish?
BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:
SGT. DONOWITZ
We both speak a little Italian.
BRIDGET
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn’t exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don’t have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and
brazen through it, is
that the plan?
LT. ALDO
That’s about it.

[123]

BRIDGET
That sounds good.
LT. ALDO
It sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?
BRIDGET
No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it
with that, I can get you in the building.
(changes tone)
So, who does what?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak the most Italian, so
I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he’ll be your Italian
cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.
HIRSCHBERG
I don’t speak Italian.
LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you
start practicing right now.
BRIDGET
(meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?
UTIVICH
Do you mean me?
BRIDGET
I didn’t mean any offense.
UTIVICH
None taken, you German cunt.
LT. ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.
UTIVICH
I can’t drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:
BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!

[124]

UTIVICH
Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.
LT. ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours
before the movie tomorrow.
More than enough time for you to learn to
drive.
UTIVICH
No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!
LT. ALDO
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And
yes, yes, yes, you will.
(changes tone)
Look, Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test.
Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a
Tennessee mountain road.
And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?
HIRSCHBERG
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Teach ’im.
BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This
is a movie premiere.
I can’t show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But
sometime tomorrow I
have to get my hair done.
All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.
LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who
went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.

[125]

BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FIVE
“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”
FADE OFF
INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT
We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the
cinema. We’ve never been in here before.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:
“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”
Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real
attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning.
This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard
coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the
Germanic miasma below.
SHOSANNA’S POV
WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests
dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up
the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally)
leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing
away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the
fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS
providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the
lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very
fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the periodstyle black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s
on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.
From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby,
all the fucking way!

[126]

INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She
takes out a key and opens it.
INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT
Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for
reel five (which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection
booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.
SHOSANNA
Shut up, fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips
meet.
SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let’s go over it again?
MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.
SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film comes on
in the fourth reel, so somewhere
toward the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!

[127]

INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi
military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German
celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne
from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with
theater stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all
their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress
uniform.
CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from
a looking-down perspective of the guests entering the building.
THEN . . .
A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s
think bubble a little scene plays out.
THINK BUBBLE
A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and
screams at everybody:
COL. LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.
COL. LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none
other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.
COL. LANDA
Can you speak, Sergeant?

[128]

SGT. WILLI
(weakly)
Yes, Colonel.
COL. LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in there.
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and
as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed
lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their
tuxedos flank her.
CU COL. LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Fräulein von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?
BRIDGET
Col. Landa, it’s been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
COL. LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.
They chuckle and air kiss.
COL. LANDA
So what’s happened to your lovely
leg? A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.
BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests to fall into that honeypot.
Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .
COL. LANDA
Seriously, what happened?

[129]

BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
COL. LANDA
Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your
leg—mountain climbing?
BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes, it is.
A brief moment passes between the two . . .
THEN . . .
The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in
fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .
COL. LANDA
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at
your misfortune. It’s just
. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein,
what could have ever
compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy
endeavor?
The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.
BRIDGET
Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell
you that.
COL. LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this
mountain, last night?
BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday
morning.
COL. LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a second.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

[130]

COL. LANDA
I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?
BRIDGET
I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of
German. They’re friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(meaning Donny)
And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing
Basterds.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel
Hans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can’t show it.
Aldo sticks out his hand . . .
LT. ALDO
Buongiorno.
The German takes his hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Margheriti . . .
(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?
LT. ALDO
(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .
. ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.

[131]

COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
I’m sorry, again . . . ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Once more . . .?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
Margheriti.
(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
What’s your name again?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Again . . . ?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg . . .
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the
group:

[132]

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Dominick Decocco?
HIRSCHBERG
Dominic Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Bravo . . . Bravo.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find their seats.
Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us. I have some friends I’d
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
Merci.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she
is our hostess for the evening.
(FRENCH)
And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and
none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is
Bridget von Hammersmark.

[133]

BRIDGET
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
BRIDGET
(FRENCH)
I’m afraid my companions don’t speak
any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio,
Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian
associates need help finding their seats.
Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind
as to escort them?
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .
Hirschberg . . .
reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .
He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because
if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says:
HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.

[134]

The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian
boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight,
she’s going to burn him alive, and says:
SHOSANNA
Prego.
BACK TO THE LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS IN GERMAN:
GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
I must call the Führer. He doesn’t
want to make his entrance until everybody is
seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The
Führer has
heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you
personally.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Me? Why?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with
your resolve. An accident like you’ve just
experienced, and
yet you still show up to an
important party event. The Führer
was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.
(to Aldo
in Italian)
I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion,
but only for a moment.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend
me.

[135]

COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain
her long.
What are either of them supposed to do, argue?
Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers
in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy
alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?
Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers
in the now-vacant lobby.
INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT
Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.
COL. LANDA
Have a seat, Fräulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and
places it in front of the fräulein.
He sits, their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?

[136]

Patting his lap.
COL. LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.
BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.
COL. LANDA
I assure you, Fräulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot
and places it in the colonel’s lap.
The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that
hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .
. . . . He removes the shoe . . .
. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .
THEN . . .
He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe
the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .
He slips it on her foot . . .
. . . . It fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.
Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
What’s that American expression . . .
“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”
He removes her foot from his lap.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Do you admit your treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.

[137]

BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
The only think I will admit to is resisting you
. . .
(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches . . .
(GERMAN)
. . . to my last breath.
COL. LANDA
“Resist to your last breath”?
SUDDENLY . . .
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat.
Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT
OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant lady’s neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF
HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
She’s dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are
TREMBLING . . .
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling
that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK
(filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

[138]

Into the phone, in German, he says:
COL. LANDA
Inform the Führer the audience has
taken their seats, and we’re ready
to begin.
Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.
He then dials another number . . .
INT—LOBBY—NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .
He’s THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modernday Secret Service, within seconds his wrists are handcuffed behind
his back and he’s searched. They find the BOMB attached to his
ankle. It’s removed, and a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his head.
Then he’s hoisted up and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the
auditorium is none the wiser . . .
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the
master race, waiting for showtime.
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red
carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.
Aldo’s put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd . . . anything.
COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner,
says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, I presume?

[139]

LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?
COL. LANDA
You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My
hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a
long time to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
COL. LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform,
bound and bagged like the lieutenant.
The truck drives off.
Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade
pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and
the rest of the entourage make their way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.
EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.
INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich is crying inside his hood.
LT. ALDO
Utivich?
UTIVICH
Is that you, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yep.

UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?

[140]

UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
LT. ALDO
No, I do not.
UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.
LT. ALDO
Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.
This bag get to anyone.
UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?
LT. ALDO
John Wayne’s a pampered movie star.
He bursts into tears if his cook
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin’ a bag over his head and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich giggles through the tears.
LT. ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin’
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.
EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La
Louisaiane).
The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.
INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open
for something else rustic tavern.

[141]

The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now
see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way
radio set up in the tavern.
Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated
American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.
COL. LANDA
Italian? Really?
(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been thinking?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak a little Italian—
COL. LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn’t begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don’t get me
wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what
with you losing your Germans. And I have
nothing but admiration for improvisation.
Still . . . Chico Marx is more
convincing. If the three of you had
shown up at the premiere dressed
in woman’s attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert outside.
They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the
private, and a German radio man in the corner.

[142]

COL. LANDA
So you’re Aldo the Apache?
LT. ALDO
So you’re the Jew Hunter?
COL. LANDA
Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
UTIVICH
Well, you do hafta admit, it is
catchy.
COL. LANDA
Do you control the nicknames your enemies
bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and the Little Man?
UTIVICH
What do you mean, the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
The German’s nickname for you.
UTIVICH
The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
Or the “Little One”, either one means you.
And as if to make my point, I’m a
little surprised how tall you
are in real life. I mean, you’re a
little fellow. But not circus-midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.
LT. ALDO
Where are my men? Where is Bridget
von Hammersmark?
COL. LANDA
Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in
whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.

[143]

COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Well, let’s just say she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paisanos
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—
LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?
COL. LANDA
Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t
interrogate every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors . . . ?
We simply aren’t operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg
and Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call it a terrorist plot, as of
this moment is still a go.
The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.
LT. ALDO
That’s a pretty exciting story.
What’s next, Eliza on the ice?
COL. LANDA
However, all I have to do is
pick up that phone right there,
inform the cinema, and your plans
kaput.
LT. ALDO
IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still
alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no
way you gonna take
them boys without settin’ off them bombs.

[144]

COL. LANDA
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die, and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you’ve done to his big night. But you
won’t get Hitler, you won’t
get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering,
and you won’t get Boormann. And you
need all four to end the war.
(pause)
But if I don’t pick up that phone
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war . . . tonight.
The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says:
COL. LANDA
So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of
ending the war . . . tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
COL. LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or
possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .
. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more
than yourselves.
Would you agree?
LT. ALDO
I guess so.
COL. LANDA
How about you, Utivich?
UTIVICH
I guess so too.
COL. LANDA
Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I
have no intention of killing Hitler, and
killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and
killing Boormann, not to mention winning the
war single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

[145]

Now they get it.
COL. LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
we have to make a deal.
LT. ALDO
What kinda deal?
COL. LANDA
The kind you wouldn’t have the
authority to make. However, I’m sure this
mission of yours has a
commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For
. . .
(thinking)
. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.
COL. LANDA
Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, that’s a bingo?
LT. ALDO
You just say, bingo.
COL. LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a
very capable two-way
radio. And sitting behind it is a
more than capable radio operator
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the power of
the pen to authorize my—
let’s call it, the terms of my conditional
surrender, if that tastes better going down.
BACK TO THE PREMIER
Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.

[146]

The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .
FILM REELS rotate . . .
35mm FILM moves through the projector’s film gate . . .
The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the
SCREEN . . .
Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .

Donowitz and Hirschberg watch . . .
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film

BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the
other end.
COL. LANDA
. . . So, when the military history of this
night is written, it will be recorded that I
was part of
Operation Kino from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S.
colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a
necessary evil to
establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last
part is actually true.
FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.

[147]

He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided
conversation.
COL. LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of “Operation
Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of
Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to purchase
property for me on
Nantucket island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I’ve saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist Party to a
swifter than imagined end. Do you
have all that, sir?
(pause)
I look forward to seeing you face to face as
well, sir.
(pause)
He’s right here.
The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his
orders:
RADIO VOICE (OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck and bring
them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir.
The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.

[148]

COL. LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success.
You too, Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson
Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.
COL. LANDA
Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.
CHEERS.
BACK TO THE PREMIERE
WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.
A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers
the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
What’s the death toll?
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.
WE HEAR A SHOT.
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must destroy
that tower!
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand
years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.

[149]

SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares
it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing
now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be
show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.
DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM
NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each
other in this hostile environment.
Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian
they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O”
to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:
They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ITALIAN-ISH)
I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.)
When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb.)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazis.
Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his
ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn’t get it.
HIRSCHBER
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.

[150]

HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a.
(They’re looking at the screen, not you.)
HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.
(Fantastic.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o
(pointing to
watch)
You-a, pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and
get out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
What-o?
(What?)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought “What-a” meant “What.”
Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)
HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.”
(Oh, sorry, I meant what.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and
get the fuck out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Good-a, luck-a.
(Good luck.)

[151]

Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark
auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the
Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.
DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’
gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through
them.
They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.
Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole washroom to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.
MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into
the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors
and peers inside.
WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.
Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.
INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either
side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one
notices Marcel’s actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE
(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE
SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies
like a junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and
pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?
He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!

[152]

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s
ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least
sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:
GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we’ll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly,
stares at him.
He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.
She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:
SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?
FREDRICK
I came to visit you.
SHOSANNA
Can’t you see how busy I am?
FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend an assist.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t
be here. This is your premiere. You
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.

[153]

FREDRICK
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains, this film
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men. Consequently,
the part of the film
that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching
this part.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but—
FREDRICK
—So, I thought I’d come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven’t lost my touch.
DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes
from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.
CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi
enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY
ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN
. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE
LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s
done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE
THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF
THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge.
As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
(GERMAN)
Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now
pay up.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring
the way.
SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel change.

[154]

FREDRICK
Let me do it?
SHOSANNA
No.
FREDRICK
Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done
a reel change.
SHOSANNA
I said, no.
FREDRICK
(cute whine)
Come on, it’s my premiere.
SHOSANNA
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass,
you’ve forgotten what the
word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you
can’t come in here. Now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.
FREDRICK
Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it’s just physical pain.
Fredrick steps forward . . .
Shosanna steps backward . . .
FREDRICK
I’m not a man you say “Go away”
to. There’s over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia that, if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me
at your peril.

[155]

BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.
SOLDIER’S POV
He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge
from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt
and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny
walks toward us . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer . . .

Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS:
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!!!
The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward
Donny’s chest . . .
WHEN . . .
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES
a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .
The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened
in front of them.

[156]

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the
door.
FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .
. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to
the floor . . .
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into
the audience . . .
The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her
weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience . . .
. . . up to the big screen . . .
. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.
The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s
heart . . .
. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .
. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .
. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still
ALIVE . . .
Shosanna moves to him . . .
. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .
. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .
. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .
. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .
BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor . . .
. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .

[157]

. . . FIRES . . .
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .
. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .
Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet
at a time . . .
. . . FIRES . . .
A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .
The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth
floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and
DYING . . .
WHEN . . .
. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring,
informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.
Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going
to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel
change.
CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German:
HITLER
Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats
his hand.
PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful
effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .
AUDITORIUM
Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle,
then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his row’s
knees.

[158]

PROJECTION BOOTH
Like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl’s mountain films,
Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was
Pitz Palu . . .
FILM ONSCREEN
Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top farright corner of the FRAME, WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK . . .
PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna hanging onto the projector, waiting for the 2nd reel
change mark. It’s an agonizing effort . . .
BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue . . .
HIRSCHBERG
gets out of his row and begins walking up the aisle in the middle
of the cinema toward the exit.
ONSCREEN
SERGIO LEONE CU FREDRICK. He SCREAMS to the Russians below:
MOVIE ZOLLER
Who wants to send a message to
Germany?
In the top right of THE FRAME, the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON . .

Shosanna TOSSES herself to the floor, as she THROWS THE CHANGE-OVER

projection booth floor. Like her family before here, dead from Nazi
bullets.

AUDITORIUM
ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICK’S EX CU
CUT TO
ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU
CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky),
SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking
down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.
HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When
he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.
BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the
EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says
in FRENCH:
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting
your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you
dispicable German swine that you’re all going
to die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.
HIRSCHBERG
reacts.
MARCEL
smiles.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
And I want you to look deep in the face of the
Jew who’s going to do it.
AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen,
behind the heads of most of them . . .
The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .
EXPLODES.

[160]

BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and
propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the
auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion
of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts . . .
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple
from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the
audience below . . .
ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the
face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!
BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling
little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE
OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .
HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”
SWARM OF BODIES . . .
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
their grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .
Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.
HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar
to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have
on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms,
heads, torsos, and asses.
THEN . . . ,
DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

[161]

COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE
THEATER.
As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .
These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military
teletype:
“OPERATION KINO A COMPLETE SUCCESS.”
FADE OUT
FADE UP
“HITLER DEAD. GOEBBELS DEAD. BOORMANN DEAD.
GOERING DEAD. ZOLLER DEAD. MOST OF HIGH COMMAND
DEAD.”

CUT TO
EXT—WOODS—MORNING
It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:
HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members
of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.

[162]

Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.
Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.
COL. LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.
DAGGER.
COL. LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your
prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the
colonel’s hands behind his back.
COL. LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo
says:
LT. ALDO
I’m a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col. Landa is appalled.
COL. LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal
with your general for that man’s life!
LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give
a fuck about him, they
need you.
COL. LANDA
You’ll be shot for this.

[163]

LT. ALDO
Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll
be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You
know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you
made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d
make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you
make that deal?
UTIVICH
I’d make that deal.
LT. ALDO
I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
you’re willing to barbecue the whole high
command, I suppose that’s worth certain
considerations. Now I don’t
care about you gettin’ pensions,
merit badges, ticker-tape parades,
who gives a damn, let’s all go home.
But I do have one question.
When you go to your little place on
Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna
take off that handsome-looking S.S.
uniform of yours, ain’t ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.
LT. ALDO
That’s what I thought. Now that . . .
. . . I can’t abide. How bout you,
Utivich, can you abide it?
UTIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.
LT. ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you’d wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m
aware that ain’t practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s
face.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give you a little
somethin you can’t take off.

[164]

CU COL. LANDA
The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
forehead.
COL. LANDA’S POV
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two
Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.
Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:
LT. ALDO
You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just
might be my masterpiece.
They ghoulishly giggle.
