On BLACK SCREEN: Run CAPTIONS:

MAY 9TH 1940: HITLER HAS INVADED CZECHOSLOVAKIA, POLAND,
DENMARK, AND NORWAY. HE IS NOW POISED TO CONQUER THE REST OF
EUROPE.

IN BRITAIN, PARLIAMENT HAS LOST FAITH IN ITS LEADER, NEVILLE
CHAMBERLAIN.

THE SEARCH FOR A REPLACEMENT HAS ALREADY BEGUN…
FADE IN....
INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER - DAY
...is in an uproar. The PRIME MINISTER, NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN
(71), sits with the MAJORITY, RULING CONSERVATIVE PARTY on
one side of the house...
...whilst the LEADER of the MINORITY, OPPOSITION LABOUR
PARTY, CLEMENT ATTLEE (57) sits with the OPPOSITION PARTIES
on the other side.
They face each other like two warring armies. Shouting.
Accusations. Wild gesturing. Paper darts thrown. Mayhem.
CAPTION:

MAY 9, 1940

ATTLEE rises to his feet, amid jeers and heckles, to denounce
CHAMBERLAIN, directly opposite him across the aisle ATTLEE
Mr Speaker! Mr Speaker!
SPEAKER
The Honourable Leader of the
Opposition, Clement Attlee!
ATTLEE
Mr Speaker--Mr Speaker--it seems I
have not been clear enough. Then
let me leave no doubt regarding my
feelings about Mr Chamberlain’s
future as Prime Minister.
(over boos and applause)
Owing to his years of inactivity
and incompetence (cheers and boos)
(MORE)

2.
ATTLEE (CONT'D)
- we find him personally
responsible, personally responsible
for leaving our nation ruinously
unprepared to face the present Nazi
peril. We are at war, Mr Speaker.
At war. And leaving aside whether
he is fit to be a leader in peacetime he has proven himself
incapable of leading us in wartime.
Cries of support to this Looking down from the LORDS GALLERY is - VISCOUNT HALIFAX
(59), appalled by what he is seeing. He exchanges a look with
the bereft CHAMBERLAIN.
ATTLEE (CONT’D)
Therefore, in the national
interest, we the Opposition, are
willing to enter into a Grand
Coalition--with the “ruling”
Conservative Party, so-called!...
An OPPOSITION MP stands and starts singing "Rule Britannia".
Others soon begin to join in.
SPEAKER
Order! Order!
ATTLEE
...but not, and I stress this,
never, under the leadership of Mr
Chamberlain...
(angle on CHAMBERLAIN)
...who has lost the confidence of
this House!
A REBEL CONSERVATIVE MEMBER rises and crosses the floor to
stand with the OPPOSITION MPs, betraying Chamberlain.
ATTLEE (CONT’D)
(directly to CHAMBERLAIN)
In the country’s interest man,
resign! Step down! And let us
find a new leader!
UPROAR, and many cry “HEAR-HEAR!” and “GO!”
SPEAKER
I said, ORDER!
The camera passes along the CONSERVATIVE benches to find
ANTHONY EDEN (43), behind him sits KINGSLEY WOOD (59).
KINGSLEY WOOD
(into EDEN’s ear)
Where’s Winston?

3.
On the bench beside EDEN, as if to reserve a space, is an old
Royal Naval Yacht Club CAP.
EDEN
Ensuring his fingerprints
are not on the murder weapon.
The singing of “Rule Britannia” continues over INT. DINING ROOM/ SIR JOHN SIMON’S COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN addresses the other CONSERVATIVE guests
gathered around a circular dining table.
CHAMBERLAIN
Accordingly--tomorrow--I will
resign as Prime Minister.
GREAT FEAR in the faces of the NOBLES. CUT BETWEEN their
FACES, during the following CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
(suppressing emotion)
As the Opposition refuse to join a
government headed by me, we must
select my successor.
(beat)
I will step down tomorrow but I
wanted my own party, the gentlemen
I most respect, to know first.
LORD LONDONDERRY.
Halifax. There’s no question!
Our Foreign Secretary SIR JOHN SIMON
No contest! HALIFAX
HALIFAX
I appreciate your confidence but my
time has yet to come. However, on
whomever the task may fall, he
shall be charged with the security
of these islands and of our Empire,
and shall be required to explore
all avenues.
CHAMBERLAIN
Including that of Diplomatic talks.
HALIFAX
Indeed, towards the restoration of
peace in Europe.
ALL
Hear Hear!!!

4.
CHAMBERLAIN
Gentlemen, I’m afraid there is only
one candidate. Only, one man that
the Opposition will accept?
ALL

Oh no.

SIR JOHN SIMON
Surely not...
INT. CHARTWELL/ COUNTRY HOUSE OF WINSTON & CLEMENTINE
CHURCHILL DAY

CAPTION:

FRIDAY, MAY 10, 1940

A plate of BACON & EGGS is set on a BREAKFAST TRAY. Then...a
glass of WHITE WINE is poured by WINSTON’s VALET, SAWYERS,
and set beside the plate. A glass of SCOTCH and SODA is also
prepared and set beside these on the tray. For Breakfast?
SAWYERS carries the TRAY through servants quarters towards
the ENTRANCE HALL of the house, where - the TRAY passes by - WINSTON’s PRIVATE SECRETARY, JOHN
EVANS (35), as he schools the NEW YOUNG SECRETARY, ELIZABETH
LAYTON. Evans, an immaculately-groomed rake, snobbishly
thinks himself infinitely superior to the Elizabeth Laytons
of the world.
JOHN EVANS
(to ELIZABETH)
...and if he stretches out his hand
and says, “Gimme”, you need to
anticipate what he wants - black
pen, red pen, paper, or “Clop”,
that’s his hole punch.
EVANS and LAYTON walk past - SAWYERS-with-TRAY, as he waits for the COOK to iron a
NEWSPAPER (DAILY EXPRESS)and as the SCULLERY MAIDS, over her
shoulder, ANXIOUSLY read the headline:
"CHAMBERLAIN TO RESIGN”
SAWYERS
Don’t smudge the ink.
MAID
How selfish to resign, time like
this.
COOK
D’you think they’ll take me to
Downing Street?

5.
SAWYERS
Not after the Spotted Dick you
served last week.
The COOK then sets the PAPER on the TRAY, whereupon SAWYERS
carries the TRAY up the stairs.
CUT TO:
EVANS and LAYTON approach a BEDROOM DOORWAY.
JOHN EVANS
...He mumbles, so it’s almost
impossible to catch everything.
And be prepared to type fast –
short bursts - and double-spaced,
he hates single-spaced--hates it!
Good luck.
EVANS knocks on the door, opens it and then pushes the nowquaking ELIZABETH LAYTON inside, closing the door again.
INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
Her POV of the dimly-lit room. And then, a MATCH is struck, a
CIGAR lit. We can just make out a MAN in bed, as SAWYERS tugs open the CURTAINS, revealing - WINSTON CHURCHILL (65), in BED, with the BREAKFAST TRAY on
his lap, in a pink silk dressing-gown (naked beneath). His
dispatch box, piled high with telegrams, stands open by his
bed . His marmalade cat, TANGO, sits at the end of the bed,
as WINSTON reads a dispatch and dictates...
WINSTON
To the French Ambassador. Come on WINSTON looks up at ELIZABETH, to see if she is writing this
down. She’s not WINSTON (CONT’D)
- telegram!
ELIZABETH realises, to her horror, that the dictation has
already begun, and she hurries to the TYPE-WRITER, which has
already been loaded with a sheet...She begins to type FAST,
in short bursts WINSTON (CONT’D)
(dictating)
With German forces crossing into
Holland...Holland alone...request
reassurance...that French forces
will now move--move at once--to
protect Belgium. Stop. Read!

6.
ELIZABETH
(nervously)
“To--to the French Ambassador.
With German forces crossing
into Holland...Holland alone...
request reassurance that WINSTON
- immediate reassurance ELIZABETH adjusts the typewriter’s carriage and paten and
types the word “IMMEDIATE” above the previous text...
ELIZABETH
“- immediate - reassurance - “
WINSTON
“ - that -” Go on - “- that “
SAWYERS enters, as ELIZABETH struggles to re-set the
carriage.
ELIZABETH
“ - that - “
The BEDROOM TELEPHONE rings

-

SAWYERS
French Ambassador sir WINSTON
Monsieur Ambassador!
(pause)
Ah. They’ve already invaded
Belgium.
(pause)
I will convey your plea to the
Prime Minister at once. Yes, the
situation is still very confused.
Goodbye.
WINSTON hangs up. A concerned pause, and then WINSTON (CONT’D)
Holland and Belgium.
ELIZABETH types this - tap,tap,tap,tap WINSTON (CONT’D)
No, no, no.

Sir?

ELIZABETH
(confused)

WINSTON
Scrap that. New telegram.

7.
In a fluster, she pulls out the old PAGE from the TYPEWRITER
CARRIAGE and quickly inserts a new page, as WINSTON (CONT’D)
To General Ismay...
WINSTON grabs his WHISKEY and SODA, as - the PHONE rings
again. SAWYERS re-appears.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Dammit Sawyers! What is it now?!
Your son.

SAWYERS

WINSTON, his concentration broken, goes to the PHONE.
WINSTON
(into Phone)
Randolph, quickly (listens)
Last night they said I may be made
Prime Minister today. But that was
yesterday. Let’s see what Neville
does today. Thank--thank you my
boy. Keep buggering on!
Puts down the phone. Turns to look at ELIZABETH.
Now...

WINSTON (CONT’D)

Sips his SCOTCH. This calms him.
ELIZABETH LAYTON
General Ismay...
Moving to the end of the bed WINSTON
Ah, General Ismay.
(to Sawyers)
Sawyers - get rid of this will you?
Winston gestures to Sawyers to move his tray away and then
swings his legs - indecorously! - out of bed. ELIZABETH
quickly turns her face away! WINSTON then begins to pace WINSTON (CONT’D)
In the light of today’s events, the
time is ripe for many preparations
to be made...
(beat)
Are you striking those typewriter
keys in a normal fashion? It’s
awfully loud, I can’t think!
(beat)
Read it back.

8.
ELIZABETH
Ahh--To General Ismay. In the light
of today’s events, the time is
right for many prep WINSTON
RIPE! Not RIGHT! God's teeth girl!
I said ripe, ripe, ripe - P-P-P!
The last sentence...
ELIZABETH LAYTON
(shaken)
The--the time is ripe...
For! FOR!

WINSTON

ELIZABETH LAYTON
(her nerve broken)
...many...many...many...
WINSTON
How many “many”s did you write?!
One many!
(sighs)
“For...for MANY preparations-to be made...”
He walks up to her and looks over her chair, and is horrified
to see WINSTON (CONT’D)
Single-spaced? What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
ELIZABETH
Someone set it on single-spaced
and before I realised WINSTON
Then why did you persist?!
I -

ELIZABETH

As she starts to rush out WINSTON
Tell Evans to send me someone who
can do it right the first time!
RIGHT! T-T-T-T!
INT. HALLWAY/ CHARTWELL - DAY
ELIZABETH comes down the stairs, and stops, her face tearstained.

9.
CLEMENTINE CHURCHILL - WINSTON’s WIFE, 55 YEARS OLD beautiful, elegant, highly-strung, is at that moment crossing
the hall, with a HANDFUL of BROWN ENVELOPES. She sees
ELIZABETH.
CLEMMIE
Ah. He shouted at you. Did he shout
at you?
ELIZABETH
Yes, but I....
CLEMMIE
He can be an awful brute.
ELIZABETH
No! I made too many mistakes.
CLEMMIE
I think you were nervous. And he
has a knack for drawing out the
very worst in those trying to
help him the most.
ELIZABETH
Oh it’s not him. It’s me. He’s he’s CLEMMIE
He’s just a man, like any other.
Wait here.
CLEMMIE climbs the stairs.
INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
CLEMMIE enters - WINSTON (on his knees) is looking for Tango
the cat under his bed.
CLEMMIE
My Darling?
WINSTON
The War Cabinet has been called.
The bloody cat is under the bed
again.
CLEMMIE indicates that SAWYERS should go and moves around
WINSTON tucking his shirt in.
CLEMMIE
Can I tell you something that I
feel you ought to know?
He looks at her -

10.
CLEMMIE (CONT’D)
I’ve noticed a recent deterioration
in your manner. You’re not so kind
as you used to be. You’ve become
rough, sarcastic, over-bearing and
rude.
WINSTON
Is this about the new girl?
CLEMMIE
If the King asks you to become
Prime Minister WINSTON
We don’t know that CLEMMIE
I don’t want you to be disliked.
WINSTON
More than I already am?
CLEMMIE
Darling, you may be on the brink,
the brink--of having tremendous
power, surpassed only by the King.
With such power you really must try
to be more kind and, if possible,
calm. I want others to love and
respect you as I do.
Clemmie falls back in the bed, shortly joined by Winstonthey share a moment of fondness.
EXT. CHARTWELL - DAY
WIDE SHOT of Chartwell bathed in sunshine. ELIZABETH LAYTON,
with hat and coat now on, is attempting to make a discreet
escape from the house but is stopped by a MOTORCYCLE COURIER
with a telegram to deliver. We do not hear what is said.
CLOSE-UP on the telegram turning in ELIZABETH’S hands as the
COURIER rides away. ELIZABETH looks back to the house, makes
her decision and re-enters the lair.
INT. STAIRS / CHARTWELL - DAY
ELIZABETH climbs the stairs holding a telegram, braced to
once more enter the Lion’s Den. She enters INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
- and finds WINSTON, CLEMMIE, JOHN EVANS, SAWYERS and a MAID all listening with rapt attention to a RADIO BROADCAST.

11.
BBC RADIO ANNOUNCER
“This is BBC Home Service. Here is
a short news bulletin. The German
army invaded Holland and Belgium
early this morning, by land, and
land parachutes-ELIZABETH
There’s a telegram.
Sssshhh!

JOHN EVANS

BBC RADIO ANNOUNCER
...”The Armies of the Low Countries
are resisting. An appeal for help
has been made to the Allied
governments and Brussels says the
Allied troops are moving to their
support...”
ELIZABETH
It’s from the Palace.
All eyes turn to look at her, as if an elephant has entered
the room. A silent beat in which no-one breathes.
WINSTON
Thank you, Miss...?
Layton.

ELIZABETH

INT. STUDY/HALLWAY, CHARTWELL - DAY
CLEMMIE hands WINSTON his watch, glasses, cigar case, matches
and a sugar cube.
CLEMMIE
You’re shaking.
WINSTON
So are you!
It’s true CLEMMIE is just as nervous CLEMMIE
You from excitement--I from terror.
You have been wanting this your
entire adult life.
WINSTON
No--since the nursery.
CLEMMIE laughs.

12.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
But do the public want me?
CLEMMIE
It’s your own Party to whom you’ll
have to prove yourself.
WINSTON
I’m getting the job only because
the ship is sinking. It’s not a
gift, it’s revenge.
CLEMMIE
Let them see your true qualities.
Your courage...
WINSTON
...My poor judgement.
CLEMMIE
...Your lack of vanity.
WINSTON
...My iron will.
CLEMMIE
(in playful rebuke)
...Your sense of humour.
Ho Ho Ho!
Now go.
Go?
Be.
Be?

WINSTON
CLEMMIE
WINSTON
CLEMMIE
WINSTON

She touches his face tenderly Yourself.

CLEMMIE

WINSTON
Which self?
CLEMMIE walks away. WINSTON turns to a wall on which are
hung many HATS - (Royal Naval Yacht Club Cap, Admiral’s hat
with plume, aviator helmet with goggles, riding hat, pith
helmet, French WW1 helmet, fez, Homburg, top hat, etc ) all
on display like HUNTING TROPHIES.

13.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Which self should I be today?
WINSTON surveys the collection, then plucks the TOP HAT from
its hook WINSTON (CONT’D)
One should have had power when a
young man. When wits were sharp,
sinews strong. Oh well.
He returns to her WINSTON (CONT’D)
Lead on Macduff-When youth departs-may wisdom prove enough.
They kiss, and she gives him a silver BOX OF MATCHES,
embossed with loving message from his children.
EXT/INT. PRINCES STREET/ WINSTON’S CAR - DAY
WINSTON, in the back seat, (with JOHN EVANS in front) looks
out the window at the human traffic - seems like he’s in a
gold-fish bowl, disconnected. He watches as - MEN IN BOWLER
HATS and YOUNG WOMEN in SUMMER DRESSES walk to work.
JOHN EVANS
Hardly seems like there’s a war
on at all.
THREE DELIVERY BOYS ride by on bicycles, notice him and wave
excitedly.
WINSTON
How odd it is.
Sir?

JOHN EVANS

They stop, waiting behind a BUS.
WINSTON
You know--I have never ridden a
bus. Never queued for bread. I
believe I can boil an egg but only
because I saw it done once.
EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
WINSTON’s car approaches the Palace gates, which are open.
The CAR drives up to the PALACE. WINSTON gets out and he and
EVANS enter the PALACE -

14.
INT. PALACE ENTRANCE - DAY
A grand hall.
Winston removing his hat and coat, hands his cane and gloves,
then hat to a LIVERIED DOORMAN whilst a LIVERIED STAFF MEMBER
waits nearby.
WINSTON
The only time I tried to ride the
Underground was during the General
Strike. Clemmie dropped me at South
Kensington station. I went down-but I got lost and came straight
back up. Awful!
(girding himself)
Well, “Here we go”...
EVANS
Good luck sir.
WINSTON strides away, following the EQUERRY.
INT. STATE CHAMBERS/ BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
KING GEORGE VI (agitated, troubled) speaks with the ill,
weak, outgoing PRIME-MINISTER NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.
CHAMBERLAIN watches the KING.
GEORGE VI
Why not Halifax? I favour Halifax.
CHAMBERLAIN
I wanted Halifax. The Lords wanted
Halifax. Halifax wanted Halifax.
GEORGE VI
Then--then why have I been forced
to send for Churchill?
CHAMBERLAIN
Because he’s the only member of our
party who has the support of the
Opposition.
GEORGE VI
His record is a litany of
catastrophe. Gallipoli, 25,000
dead. The India Policy. Russian
Civil War. The Gold Standard. The
the the Abdication. And now this
Norway ‘adventure’. What, eighteen
hundred men?

15.
CHAMBERLAIN
One aircraft carrier, two cruisers,
seven destroyers and a submarine.
GEORGE VI
Winston lacks judgement.
CHAMBERLAIN
He was right about Hitler.
GEORGE VI
Even a stopped clock is right
twice a day.
EQUERRY enters.
EQUERRY
First Lord of the Admiralty,
Mr Winston Churchill!
Early.
Keen.

GEORGE VI
CHAMBERLAIN

GEORGE VI
I accept your resignation--but I
want you to know--how--cruelly I
think you’ve been treated.
CHAMBERLAIN
Thank you Your Majesty.
He and GEORGE shake hands.
EQUERRY
This way, my Lord.
The KING waits - SIGHS deeply, until...
We hear footsteps approaching. WINSTON enters.
WINSTON
Your Majesty.
GEORGE VI
Mr Churchill.
GEORGE VI (CONT’D)
I believe you know why I--I
I have asked you here today.
WINSTON
Sir, I simply can’t imagine why.

16.
GEORGE VI
It is my duty to-to-to invite you
to take up - the position of of
Prime Minister of this United
Kingdom. Will you form a
government?
I will.
Very well.

WINSTON
GEORGE VI

WINSTON bows, and when the KING offers his hand, WINSTON
kisses it. WINSTON rises.
GEORGE VI (CONT’D)
That was--quite easy.
Yes.

WINSTON

They stare at each other in uneasy silence.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
I believe we are to meet regularly.
GEORGE VI
Once a week, I’m afraid. How are
you on--on--on Mondays?
WINSTON
I shall endeavour to be available
on Mondays.
GEORGE VI
Four o’clock?
WINSTON
(resolutely)
I nap at 4.
GEORGE VI
Is that--permissible?
WINSTON
No. But necessary. I work late.
GEORGE VI
Then perhaps lunch?
WINSTON
Lunch! Mondays.
(WINSTON bows)
Your majesty.
GEORGE VI
Prime Minister.

17.
When WINSTON backs out of the room, the KING anxiously lights
a cigarette, and broods.
EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
WINSTON pulls up in his PRIVATE CAR, alights, (followed by
EVANS) waves at the PRESS, an effortless SELF-PUBLICIST, at
total ease in the spotlight. Ever the showman - taps the
NUMBER 10 on the famous front door with his walking stick for
the amusement of the PHOTOGRAPHERS PHOTOGRAPHER
Prime Minister? First order of
business, sir?
WINSTON
A glass of Pol Roger!
He enters the building, and INT. HALLWAY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
- is greeted by EDEN.
EDEN
Prime Minister!
Anthony.

WINSTON

EDEN
How was the K-k-king?
WINSTON
Anxious. Never forgiven me for
supporting his brother’s
marriage to Wallis Simpson.
WINSTON and EDEN step into his office, with WINSTON closing
the door on EVANS in the hallway.
INT. OFFICE/ 10 DOWNING STREET - CONTINUOUS
EDEN
You only have to meet him once a
week.
WINSTON
That’s like saying you only have to
have your tooth pulled once a week.
EDEN takes out a pen, opens a notebook -

18.
EDEN
Composition of your War Cabinet.
Who should sit on it?
WINSTON
Chamberlain. And the Reverend “Holy
Fox” EDEN
(writes)
Halifax. Keeping your enemies
close?
WINSTON
More than that, without them the
party will get rid of me.
(beat)
And that sheep in sheep’s clothing,
Attlee.
MARY, CHURCHILL’s 18 year old daughter, appears in the
doorway.
MARY CHURCHILL
Come on Daddy--everyone’s waiting.
WINSTON
Be there in a jiffy, my love.
MARY exits.
EDEN
I heard that before you were asked,
they offered it to Lord Halifax.
WINSTON
(shakes head)
I doubt that. Halifax would never
turn it down. He's the fourth son
of an Earl. Fourth sons turn
nothing down.
EDEN
I only wish the position had come
your way in better times, sir. You
have an enormous task ahead of you.
WINSTON
I hope it’s not too late. I am
very much afraid it is. But we can
only do our best.
INT. LIVING ROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
CLEMMIE and the CHURCHILL CHILDREN wear GAS-MASKS as they
shout -

19.

HURRAY!
Hip Hip HURRAY!

CHURCHILL CHILDREN
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL
CHURCHILL CHILDREN

WINSTON enters - and stops, aghast, and stares at his family WINSTON
Good lord, what a frightful sight!
CLEMMIE, SARAH CHURCHILL (26), DIANA CHURCHILL(31), RANDOLPH
CHURCHILL (29) and his WIFE PAMELA (pregnant), and MARY
CHURCHILL (18) all pull off their GAS MASKS, grab their
glasses of CHAMPAGNE, then converge on him and kiss him.
He stares at them, a SMILE FORMING AT LAST, deeply touched,
actually. He is presented with a glass of champagne.
CHURCHILL
Thank you. Thank you.
PAMELA raises her glass PAMELA
A toast! Come on!
Yes!

DIANA

Mary makes her way to sit on a cushion on the floor next to
Winston.
She looks proudly at WINSTON CLEMMIE
My darling husband--Something you
all might not know is that on the
eve of our marriage I got “cold
feet”--but as I’d already called
off two engagements by the age of
21 I was in danger of gaining a
reputation for being a ‘bolter’-and it would’ve been poor form to
call off a third!
LAUGHTER. WINSTON smiles.
Hear hear.

RANDOLPH

DIANA
Lucky for Daddy.

20.
CLEMMIE
But the real reason for my wintry
feet was because I knew, even then,
that his priority would be public
life. It worried a young girl
greatly--this wretched thought of
coming second, eternally. But so it
has proven to be. And in due course
(Mary takes Winstons hand)
our children would also have to
make their own peace with this same
fact.
(directly to Winston)
We all did, you see, in our own
ways. And now, today, we all
receive our reward--proof that our
small sacrifice was for a far, far
greater good. I give you, your
father, my beloved husband - the
Prime Minister.
ALL
Prime Minister!
They raise their GLASSES in a toast CHURCHILL
Here’s to--(thinks) not buggering
it up.
FAMILY
Not buggering it up!
EXT. BIG BEN / LONDON - DAY
BIG BEN starts the WESTMINSTER CHIME -

CAPTION:

MONDAY, MAY 13, 1940

INT. WESTMINSTER HALL/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
WINSTON approaches EDEN in the ancient hall and together they
climb the steps beneath the great gothic WINDOW.
WINSTON
Belgium was a ploy. They just
punched through the Ardennes into
France and crossed the Meuse in
under 24 hours!
EDEN
No-one can cross the Meuse River in
24 hours.
WINSTON
Apparently the Germans can.

21.
INT. CLOCK TOWER - DAY
BIG BEN strikes the hour - 3 PM.
INT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
To the sound of the distant BELLS, WINSTON enters, with
EDEN, and small knuckle-knocking on woodwork, mainly from the
LABOUR benches.
WINSTON looks around, not actually surprised at the
contemptuous reception.
WINSTON
(to EDEN)
Contempt. Well, you have to
start somewhere.
In the LORDS GALLERY, above, HALIFAX enters and looks down at
proceedings, and on WINSTON, looking at his FOB-WATCH.
The HUBBUB dies down and WINSTON puts on his GLASSES.
SIR SAMUEL HOARE
(whispered, to SIMON)
Here we go.
WINSTON reaches into his waistcoat for his TYPED SPEECH, then
delivers his MAIDEN SPEECH as PRIME MINISTER...
WINSTON
Mr Speaker. On Friday evening last-I received His Majesty’s commission
to form a new administration...
ANGLE ON: CONSERVATIVE MP’s, all looking worried.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
...It was the evident wish and will
of Parliament, and the Nation, that
this should be conceived on the
broadest possible basis, and that
it should include all parties.
INT. BEDROOM / 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
CLOSE ON: TYPED PAGE (with TEXT) being rapidly tugged from a
TYPEWRITER CARRIAGE (to a LOUD explosive ratchet-whirr)!!!

CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: A FRESHLY TYPED PAGE (ROUGH DRAFT) is set down on
the desk by ELIZABETH’s hand. The stationary bears the Prime
Minister’s monogram, and we see typed TEXT plus several
phrases struck out (between parentheses).
The CAMERA moves in on the paragraph that reads...
“The three party Leaders have agreed to serve, either in
the War Cabinet, or in (positions of authority*) high

office.

WINSTON (CONT’D)
The three fighting Services have
been filled.
INT. HALLWAY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
OUTSIDE the BATHROOM DOOR - ELIZABETH LAYTON waits, with a
PAD and PAPER, taking down his dictation...

23.
WINSTON
Sawyers is she there?
ELIZABETH
Yes she is.. I mean, I am
WINSTON (O.S.)
Don’t come in!
SOUNDS of him taking a BATH, the SPONGE being squeezed over
his head...She starts to move away, but is arrested by WINSTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Don’t go away!
ELIZABETH LAYTON
No, no--I’m still here.
WINSTON (O.S.)
“With this agreement, I now invite
the House (water sounds)
- by the resolution which stands in
my name, to record its approval,
and to declare its confidence in
the new government.”
Sound of WINSTON getting out of the BATH.
WINSTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Miss? I’m coming out in a state
of nature!
ELIZABETH LAYTON flees, as the DOOR opens and as WINSTON
(naked) looks up and down the HALLWAY to see where his TYPIST
has gone.
INT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
WINSTON
I now invite the House by a
resolution to declare its
confidence in the new government.
ANGLE on the CONSERVATIVE PARTY - unimpressed.
KINGSLEY-WOOD advises A JUNIOR CONSERVATIVE, ERNLE HASTINGS.
KINGSLEY WOOD
Look to Chamberlain’s handkerchief.
If he waves it at the end of
Churchill’s speech, we show
approval, if not, keep quiet.
ERNLE HASTINGS looks over at CHAMBERLAIN.

24.
CHAMBERLAIN, still on the front bench but not in the PM’s
chair, draws a WHITE HANDKERCHIEF out of his BREAST POCKET
and folds it in his LAP.
ERNLE HASTINGS nods - understanding.
WINSTON
It must be remembered that we are
in the preliminary stage of one of
the greatest battles in history...
INT. OFFICE/ 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: A HEAVILY MARKED-UP PAGE of TYPED SPEECH (ROUGH
DRAFT) much worked-over, annotated, altered - with WINSTON’s
HAND just then adding the latest change in the margins...we
see his HAND write (in his tiny cursive scrawl) and that many (arrangements*) preparations have to be
made here at home.
WINSTON (O.S.)
...and that many preparations have
to be made here at home.
WIDE: WINSTON, alone in his OFFICE, hunkered at NIGHT, goes
through the speech, meticulous, obsessive, a perfectionist.
WINSTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Sir, I take up my task with
buoyancy and hope INT. OFFICE/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
CLOSE ON: The TYPEWRITER hammers typing the CLEAN (FINAL)
DRAFT of the speech, on SMALLER SHEETS of PAPER, the TEXT now
set out like BLANK VERSE in a POEM, or in the BIBLE, each
phrase spaced apart from the next and say to the House, as I said to those who
have joined the government WINSTON (O.S.)
- and say to the House, as I said
to those who have joined the
government INT/EXT. WINSTONS CAR, PARLIAMENT - DAY
WINSTONS car is stationary in the internal courtyard at
Parliament. WINSTON, in the back seat (with ELIZABETH LAYTON
in the front, her TYPE-WRITER on her knee, typing away)
dictates.

25.
WINSTON
- I have nothing to offer but
blood, toil--tears--and sweat.
EXTREME CLOSE ON: her keys typing:

“sweat!”

CLOSE ON: The PAGE being tugged from the TYPEWRITER.
WINSTON alights the car, and ELIZABETH passes the PAGES of
the SPEECH, which he grabs, then hurries away.
INT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
ANGLE ON: ERNLE HASTINGS, unable to take his eyes off
CHAMBERLAIN, waiting for the HANDKERCHIEF to be waved.
ANGLE ON WINSTON: readying himself for the final assault!
WINSTON
We have before us an ordeal of the
most grievous kind. We have before
us many, many long months of
struggle and of suffering. You ask,
what is our policy? I say it is to
wage war by sea, land and air, with
all our might and with all the
strength God can give us--to wage
war against a monstrous tyranny
never surpassed in the dark and
lamentable catalogue of human
crime.
ANGLE ON: HALIFAX, in the GALLERY - he shoots a look to
CHAMBERLAIN.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
That is our policy. You ask, what
is our aim? I can answer in one
word. Victory - victory at all
costs, victory in spite of terror,
victory however long and hard the
road may be. For without victory,
there is no survival.
WINSTON feels he must have won them over, but his confident
smile fades as he realises he stands alone.
Small KNUCKLE-KNOCKING begins - but it is MUTED.
SIMON and HOARE and the other CONSERVATIVE PLOTTERS all look
to CHAMBERLAIN, as he - puts his WHITE HANDKERCHIEF back in his BREAST POCKET!!!
The TORIES sit back - NONE APPLAUD.

26.
EXT - ROSE GARDEN/ DOWNING STREET - DAY
CHAMBERLAIN, attempting to catch his breath, sits on a bench
looking across the rose in bloom so ripe they’re almost
rotten.
HALIFAX sees, then approaches CHAMBERLAIN.
HALIFAX
“Our policy is to wage war--At all
costs--No survival”. Winston is
incapable of pronouncing the word
peace, let alone engaging in peace
talks.
He sits next to CHAMBERLAIN.
CHAMBERLAIN
Awful, the thought that I shall
never see my country at peace
again.
Neville?

HALIFAX

CHAMBERLAIN turns and faces HALIFAX - ashen faced.
CHAMBERLAIN
I have cancer.
HALIFAX
Oh Neville.
CHAMBERLAIN
Winston must be removed from
office.
How?

HALIFAX

CHAMBERLAIN
A vote of “no confidence”.
HALIFAX
If we can get him to declare that
he refuses to consider a negotiated
peace with Germany then perhaps you
and I will have grounds to resign.
The party wont stand for that,
you’re still the chairman for
heavens sake, that will force a
vote of “no confidence” in his
leadership and he’ll be finished.
CHAMBERLAIN
And would you agree to be Prime
Minister?

27.
HALIFAX
With Winston out of the way ... who
can say, but the important thing,
Neville, is that your policies, of
peace and the protection of this
nation, would be back on the table.
On record.
Pardon?

CHAMBERLAIN
HALIFAX

CHAMBERLAIN
He must declare on record his
refusal to engage in peace talks,
we must have it in writing.
HALIFAX’s eyes glisten with renewed purpose.
EXT. HM TREASURY - LONDON - DAY
ELIZABETH LAYTON makes her way to work, but today it’s a new
location - the grand TREASURY BUILDING in WHITEHALL,
crossing, through traffic, Horse Guards Road and entering
through the pillared main doors...
INT. TREASURY - CONTINUOUS
ECU - Elizabeth’s hand signs the Official Secrets Act which
is duly stamped.
An elderly CIVIL SERVANT hands her a security pass.
JOHN EVANS meets ELIZABETH in the lobby and leads her down to
an INCONSPICUOUS DOOR where a SOLDIER checks her security
pass.
INT. WAR ROOMS/ UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY
EVANS leads ELIZABETH down a narrow staircase that leads to
the SECRET WAR-ROOMS, the underground nerve centre of BRITISH
HIGH COMMAND.
But the place is very humble, low ceiling and narrow
hallways, the rooms small. No hint of luxury here. Austerity
Britain.
Follow me.

JOHN EVANS

ELIZABETH
What goes on down here?

28.
JOHN EVANS
That’s a need to know. And you
don’t.
JOHN EVANS keeps walking at a brisk pace through the
telephonists room.
ELIZABETH, clocking her surroundings, notices a door with a
dial lock that reads “VACANT”.
ELIZABETH
The lavatory?
EVANS
For the PM’s use only.
EVANS leads her down the corridor, through a narrow room of
bunk beds...John Evans gestures towards them.
EVANS (CONT’D)
Sleeping quarters, for when you
miss the last train.
They pass the MAP ROOM JOHN EVANS
That’s the Map Room. No women
allowed.
ELIZABETH LAYTON
What department is this?
JOHN EVANS
Indiscretion in conversation, or
any other form, within or without
these rooms regarding what happens
here is a statutory offense and
punishable by up to two years
imprisonment with hard labour.
Clear?
Crystal.
Good.

ELIZABETH
JOHN EVANS

Elizabeth follows Evans as they stop at the War Cabinet Room.
JOHN EVANS (CONT’D)
That’s the War Cabinet room--never!
Don’t mean to be rough on you but
them’s the rules.
They arrive at the TYPISTS POOL ROOM, full of NINE bust
TYPISTS.

29.
JOHN EVANS (CONT’D)
This is the typists room, you are
allowed in here.
TYPISTS
(In Unison)
Good Morning Sir.
And then indicates another Room - the door is ajar, its no
bigger than a shoe-box!
JOHN EVANS
And here’s you.
ELIZABETH enters the tiny, windowless room not much bigger
than a cupboard, containing only a desk and a chair.
CUT TO:
She arranges her effects - a BLACK PEN, a RED PEN and a HOLE
PUNCH on her desk, and then sets carefully a PHOTOGRAPH of a
HANDSOME SOLDIER.
INT. MAP ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
The CHIEFS OF STAFF brief WINSTON: IRONSIDE for the ARMY,
DOWDING (a New Zealander) for the AIR FORCE, and a NAVAL
ADMIRAL (DUDLEY POUND).
CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX are also present - as other OFFICERS
all crowd in and look up at THREE LARGE OPERATIONS MAPS of EUROPE hang on three different
walls, each full of pins and strings to show positions - ONE
for the ARMY, ONE for the NAVY, ONE for the AIR-WAR.
Down the centre of the room runs a long table bearing
MULTIPLE TELEPHONES of different colors which are always
RINGING...and being answered by OFFICERS of the three
services.
The BRIEFING begins in front of - the ARMY MAP - showing
(with pins and colored string) how far WESTWARD the GERMAN
LINE has advanced.
GENERAL IRONSIDE
Belgium and Holland may fall any
hour.
WINSTON
The French?

30.
GENERAL IRONSIDE
The entire French ninth army--some
two hundred thousand men--have
capitulated.
HALIFAX
All of them?!
GENERAL IRONSIDE
Capitulated. Surrendered. Deserted.
It was a rout. All our land forces,
roughly 300,000 men, are now in
full retreat.
WINSTON
(to DOWDING)
Air-cover? For our troops?
AIR MARSHALL DOWDING
The Luftwaffe control the skies.
We simply don’t have enough planes
to challenge them. In fact, I
strongly recommend we stop sending
our precious fighter-planes to be
wasted in France--save them for
our own defence.
WINSTON moves to the NAVAL MAP, showing WARSHIP
DEPLOYMENTS...
WINSTON
And our navy--sits idle,
neutralized, useless.
NAVAL ADMIRAL POUND
Our fleets no sooner come within
their range than we come under
blistering air attack.
WINSTON
Their speed is devastating.
WINSTON returns to the ARMY MAP GENERAL IRONSIDE
Panzer tanks. Plunging rapidly
westward, through the centre.
WINSTON
But they will have to pause for
fuel supplies.
IRONSIDE looks at GENERAL ISMAY.
Ismay?

GENERAL IRONSIDE

31.
ISMAY
This is not the last war, Sir.
Their tanks can stop for fuel at a
petrol station.
WINSTON
Petrol station?
GENERAL IRONSIDE
The road to Paris now lies open.
7 million refugees are on the move.
Collectively we are looking at the
collapse of Western Europe in a
few days.
ISMAY
Should the public be told?
WINSTON
Not yet. First, we must rouse
our old friends to an heroic
resistance. France must be saved.
CAMERA moves in on the MAP...
Over this, we start to dissolve in - footage of a FLAMINGO PASSENGER PLANE in flight - as the MAP itself dissolves into - a real rural LANDSCAPE, as seen from above...
EXT. AERIAL/ SKIES OVER FRANCE - DAY
WINSTON’s FLAMINGO PASSENGER PLANE flies over FRENCH FIELDS.
The PLANE is soon joined by two SPITFIRE FIGHTER ESCORTS, one
on each wing.
INT. FLAMINGO/ CIVILIAN PASSENGER PLANE - DAY
We see pilots in the cockpit looks down, a drink is poured
and is taken to Winston as he looks down - His face goes
grey as he sees - for the first time - CIVILIAN REFUGEES,
long meandering columns of desperate humanity.
On BOARD with WINSTON - ISMAY, DOWDING and IRONSIDE.
The SHOCK of this plays on his face.
WINSTON’s POV of: the vast tragedy. Amongst straggling
vagabonds and columns of refugees. Signs of the GERMAN
conquest - abandoned TANKS and ARTILLERY stand in flames.

32.
CLOSE ON: A YOUNG REFUGEE BOY (his POV) looks up at WINSTON’s
PLANE. He holds his left hand up to his left eye to look at
the plane.
UP WITH CAPTION:

THURSDAY MAY 16

WINSTON
This can’t go on. Must not.
INT/EXT. FRENCH AIRCRAFT HANGER - DAY
A LARGE DELEGATION of CIVILIANS and MILITARY await WINSTON,
as WINSTON alights the PLANE and approaches down a long RED
CARPET.
PRIME MINISTER REYNAUD steps forward and shakes WINSTON’s
hand.
WINSTON
(to REYNAUD)
Brace yourselves, I am about to
add to your terrible suffering-by speaking French.
They sit at a long table in the hangar.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
(in bad FRENCH)
Bien que notre situation soit très
grave ce n'est pas la première fois
que nous faisons face à une crise,
ensemble.
Subtitles:
Although our plight is grave,
this was not the first time we
has been in a crisis together.
REYNAUD
Perhaps in English, Prime Minister.
WINSTON
(after a moment’s offence)
We have--we have survived crises
before, and I am confident we will
survive this one. Tell me how you
plan to counter-attack.
REYNAUD
There is no plan.
Silence - then...
WINSTON
(in FRENCH)
You must counter-attack. Premier,
you must!
(MORE)

33.
WINSTON (CONT'D)
(in ENGLISH)
You must counter-attack!
Vous devez contrattaquer! Il le
faut! Gentlemen--I do not believe
this Panzer breakthrough is a real
invasion.
REYNAUD
Not a real invasion?
Stupefied looks from the FRENCH and ISMAY alike.
DALADIER
(in FRENCH)
Tell this to the families of the
dead perhaps.
REYNAUD
We sincerely appreciate your
efforts and optimism, but--we have
lost.
WINSTON seems unable/unwilling to process this WINSTON
As long as--as their tanks are not
supported by infantry units they
are merely little flags, stuck
on the map, because the tank crews
are unable to support themselves.
No, I refuse to see in this
spectacular raid of the German
tanks a real invasion.
Silence to this. Is WINSTON losing his mind?
EXT. FRENCH-AIRFIELD - DAY
WINSTON’s FLAMINGO takes off.
INT. FRENCH STAFF-CAR/ FRENCH AIRFIELD - DAY
REYNAUD and DALADIER, side by side in the car, watch
WINSTON’s FLAMINGO climbing into the sky REYNAUD

delusional)
DALADIER
C’est Anglais
(He’s English.)

INT. PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY - DAY
SIR JOHN SIMON and LORD LONDONDERRY walk and talk along the
libary gallery SIR JOHN SIMON
He’s an actor. In love with the
sound of his own voice.
LONDONDERRY
Oh I love to listen to him--but
we must never take his advice. Has
a hundred ideas a day. Four are
good, the other 96 downright
dangerous.
SIR JOHN SIMON
His father was a great orator
but...
LONDONDERRY
Until he lost his mind to syphilis SIR JOHN SIMON
How nations suffer for the sins of
their fathers.
Across the AISLE, STANHOPE is also talking about CHURCHILL
with SIR SAMUEL HOARE STANHOPE
My opinion? At this critical
juncture for the empire, we have a
drunkard at the wheel.
SIR SAMUEL HOARE
Wakes with a scotch, bottle of
champagne at lunch, another at
dinner, brandy and port till the
wee hours...I wouldn’t let him
borrow my bicycle!
INT. TREASURY TOILETS - DAY
KINGSLEY WOOD is talking to a COLLEAGUE KINGSLEY WOOD
He’s a Conservative, who defects to
the Liberals--lobs grenades at us

Conservative again, as it bloody
suits him! Sorry, but--he stands
for one thing: himself!

35.
INT. CHAPEL - DAY
HALIFAX is sitting with KING GEORGE VI.
HALIFAX
We might have to replace him,
Bertie.
KING GEORGE VI
Replace him?!
HALIFAX
We must strive for peace--for every
son and daughter of this land so
that we may emerge from this crisis
with something recognisable as
'home.'
KING GEORGE VI
Spoken like a true Prime Minister.
INT. KITCHEN/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY

INT. DRESSING ROOM/BEDROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
JOHN EVANS stands outside the LOO (whose door is closed),
with a note-pad and pen, ready to record WINSTON’s
instructions.
JOHN EVANS
Sir, you need to reply to the Lord
Privy Seal.
INT. LOO/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
WINSTON sits on the TOILET, reading a French newspaper whose
front page shows a picture of FRENCH SOLDIER with his arm
around his FRENCH SWEETHEART, holding up his fingers in a VFOR-VICTORY gesture (palm-outward). The headline is “V POUR
LA VICTOIRE”. Winston is sitting on the toilet.
WINSTON
The Privy Seal?
Yes sir?

JOHN EVANS

WINSTON
(reading)
“V for Victory”
WINSTON closes the newspaper, stands WINSTON (CONT’D)

Privy We hear a flush and then WINSTON appears, wearing his pink
silk dressing-gown.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
- and I can only deal with
one shit at a time!
He goes into the bedroom, followed by EVANS, where we find ELIZABETH LAYTON, typing at the nearby desk, and ANTHONY EDEN, seated in a chair beside the bed, reading
WINSTON’S TYPED SPEECH...
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Don’t spare me, Anthony--be frank.
Mmmmm.

EDEN

As EDEN reads, WINSTON stares at him, awaiting his reaction.
WINSTON
(to EDEN)
I think it’s rather good. The
ending especially.
When EDEN says nothing the wait becomes agonizing. EDEN
finishes reading the speech, turns over the last page to see
if there is more on the back. There isn’t.
WINSTON waits for the verdict. EDEN takes off his glasses
slowly and looks up at a hopeful WINSTON EDEN
I don’t think so.
WINSTON
You don’t think so, what?

37.
EDEN
You’re suggesting we’re--somehow-winning.
(beat)
We’re not.
WINSTON
No but...it will inspire them.
WINSTON (CONT'D)
You don’t understand -

EDEN
Winston, I know -

WINSTON
(stubbornly)
- no, no, no. I am going to imbue
them, Anthony, with a spirit of
feeling they don’t yet know they
have!
Silence. Stalemate. EDEN looks gravely concerned.
EDEN
You asked my opinion. I caution
against it.
WINSTON stares at his trusted ally, his hopes fading, until he snaps his finger, pointing at EDEN Cicero!

WINSTON

He’s on the move again - heading out of the bedroom, with
EVANS and LAYTON, and finally EDEN, forced to follow...
INT. HALLWAY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
WINSTON
“Live as“, “Live as brave men” da,da,da - “and if fortune is
adverse, something, something,

He then enters the INT. LIBRARY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
WINSTON
(shouting)
CLEMMIE!!! CAT!!!

CLEMMIE!!!

As he looks for his book in the library he finds
CLEMMIE...STRESSED, struggling to cope, busily writing
CHEQUES.

38.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Cat--my copy of Cicero. Did you
shelve it?
CLEMMIE
Did you hear what I said?!
WINSTON
What’s that?
CLEMMIE
We’re broke.
WINSTON
Everybody out! Get out!
He shooes JOHN EVANS, ELIZABETH and EDEN from the room as if
they were cats.
CLEMMIE
I dare not write another cheque.
WINSTON
I’ll economise - only four cigars
a day!
CLEMMIE
You’re insufferable!
(beat)
Was there something else? Anything?
WINSTON
Yes, my love for you.
CLEMMIE
How much have you had to drink
this morning?
He goes to her, drawing up a chair, close WINSTON
I see you now as I first saw you in
nineteen hundred and four across a
crowded dance-floor. I simply stood-speechless.
CLEMMIE
I must have been very beautiful to
have achieved that miraculous
effect.
WINSTON
Four years till we saw each other
again.
CLEMMIE
They went by in an absolute flash.

WINSTON
You didn’t lack for admirers. Your
fidèle serviteur in Sidney Peel.
CLEMMIE
Brilliant man.
WINSTON
Lionel Earle.
CLEMMIE
Wonderful dancer.
WINSTON
And then--at Lady St Hellier’s
dinner party--who should show up?
CLEMMIE
Pig. (little snort)
The same.

WINSTON

They look at each other, their faces very close.
CLEMMIE
Are we terribly old?
WINSTON
Yes. I’m afraid you are.
She LAUGHS and pushes him away. Winston takes her hand.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Will you hear me read my speech for
tonight’s broadcast?
EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET / TREASURY - DAY
WINSTON emerges and is accosted by... the PRESS.
TERENCE BIRKEMP
Prime Minister - the situation
in France - Is it true we’re
in full retreat? Is France lost?
He fires the REPORTER a steely look of rebuke and then spins,
faces their CAMERAS, takes his CIGAR out of his mouth with
INDEX and SECOND finger and makes, for the CAMERAS, his firstever V-FOR-VICTORY SIGN (but PALM-INWARD, the RUDE VERSION).
WINSTON crosses the road, practising a tongue-twister as he
enters the TREASURY.

40.
INT. WINSTON’S OFFICE/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
WINSTON sitting on his bed, is AGITATED, UNEASY, UNSURE now
about the speech he is to deliver on RADIO.
ELIZABETH LAYTON sits at a desk in the corner holding files
and paperwork.
Two MICROPHONES sit on a table. An ACTOR also stands by. The
Producer guides Winston to his desk.
BBC PRODUCER
So--if you will sit here - at your
desk
Mmmmm.

WINSTON

WINSTON sits, studying with CONCERN the SPEECH lying on the
table in front of him, and taking out his PEN.
BBC PRODUCER
- and speak slowly and clearly.
Into the microphone.
WINSTON starts to jot last-minute CHANGES to the SPEECH.
Increasingly PRESSURISED, he CROSSES OUT the CHANGES he just
made, and tries to write alternatives. He’s clearly in a
state.
BBC PRODUCER (CONT’D)
So--if you are ready--on the stroke
of 9 the light will go red, and we
shall go live to the nation. Nine O
Clock. Red light. You begin. Yes?
But WINSTON isn’t ready. He’s too busy trying to rewrite his
speech
The SWEEP SECOND HAND on the WALL CLOCK approaches 12.
The PRODUCER, and ELIZABETH, become very concerned now as the
last seconds vanish BBC PRODUCER (CONT’D)
Prime Minister? Are we ready?
WINSTON
(to himself)
One moment, one moment BBC PRODUCER
We are going live. Prime WINSTON
(exploding)
I SAID ONE MOMENT, DAMN YOU!

41.
This eruption stuns the PRODUCER and ELIZABETH.
WINSTON’s hand, holding the PEN, shakes now with indecision
as he fails to think of the right words in time BBC PRODUCER
Four--three--two--one...
On the stroke of 9 pm, the light goes RED, bathing him in red
light. They are LIVE.
SILENCE. TOTAL SILENCE. The PRODUCER is now in a panic.
WINSTON seems frozen for a second, until WINSTON takes a breath and begins...
WINSTON
“I speak to you for the first time
as Prime Minister in a solemn hour
for the life of our country, of our
Empire, of our allies, and, above
all, of the cause of Freedom. A
tremendous battle is raging in
France and Flanders.”
ELIZABETH sighs relief, then follows on her carbon copy,
mouthing the words, many of which she knows by heart.
CAMERA follows the WIRES that lead out of the office, down
the corridor, and into the TRANSMITTER ROOM. Reveal BBC Radio

they listen to Winston’s radio address
WINSTON (O.S.)
“...which for the first day or two
was without defenders...But!...I
have invincible confidence in the
French Army and its leaders. Only a
very small part of that splendid
Army has yet been heavily engaged;
and only a very small part of
France has yet been invaded...Side
by side, the British and French
peoples--have advanced...”
HALIFAX is disgusted by this DISTORTION of the facts.

For the last ten years I was the

Until tonight. There’s no advance.
It’s a shambles. We’re in full
retreat.
CLEMMIE
Would you be serving them tonight
by denying them sleep, terrifying
their children?
WINSTON
Even if the terror is coming?!
CLEMMIE
Because it’s coming! There is
time enough for truth.

He nods, accepting this. He walks off, still anxious. She

copy of the same PAPER ELIZABETH is giggling WINSTON passes the doorway in the corridor, then re-appears WINSTON
What’s so funny?
ELIZABETH
Prime Minister sir WINSTON
Go on. What is it?
INT. CORRIDORS - WAR ROOMS - DAY
ELIZABETH steps out into the corridor so they can have some
privacy ELIZABETH
Not sure if you know this but-the way you are doing your
V For Victory sign--well, in
the poorer quarters that gesture
means--something else.
WINSTON
What does it mean?
ELIZABETH
Wouldn’t like to say sir.
WINSTON
I was captured by the Boer. I spent
time in a South African prison.
ELIZABETH
Up yer’ bum. Sir.
WINSTON
Up yer’ bum?
WINSTON roars with LAUGHTER - which sets ELIZABETH laughing -

45.
ELIZABETH
The way you do it, sir. Yes sir.
(demonstrates)
But if you turn it around (palm out)
- that’s fine.
I see.

WINSTON

ELIZABETH
Wouldn’t like millions of people to
take it the wrong way.
WINSTON steps away, still chuckling WINSTON
Up yer’ bum!
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE / WINSTON’S OFFICE, WAR ROOMS - DAY
KING GEORGE speaks into the TELEPHONE KING GEORGE VI
Don’t wish to take too much of your
time.
(pause)
I heard you--on the--wireless.
WINSTON
Was I comprehensible?
KING GEORGE VI
The public need to be led, not
misled--not left to work it out
for them-themselves.
WINSTON
Right. Will that be all, your
majesty?
KING GEORGE VI
Yes. Good day Prime Minister.
(click)
WINSTON puts down the PHONE and turns to EVANS.
WINSTON
I believe I’ve just recieved a
royal rap on the knuckles.
INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY

CAPTION:
WAR CABINET MEETING 1

SATURDAY, MAY 25, 1940

46.
PRESENT: 17 PERSONS. The Main War Cabinet, minus WINSTON
(CHAMBERLAIN, HALIFAX, GREENWOOD, ATLEE) and the FOLLOWING
(ALEXANDER, SINCLAIR, COOPER, CADOGAN, ANDERSON, POUND,
DOWDING, IRONSIDE, BRIDGES, ISMAY, NICHOLL, WILKINSON)
CABINET SECRETARY BRIDGES is helping to seat everyone as they
move around the table looking for their placement card.
CABINET SECRETARY BRIDGES
(indicating to HALIFAX’s
seat)
Foreign Minister?
A NEW MAP shows the NEW POSITIONS of BRITISH TROOPS. SURROUNDED
at DUNKIRK.
Finally, WINSTON enters, shakes the hands of IRONSIDE and ISMAY
first, but has less enthusiasm for ATTLEE and GREENWOOD, and
nothing for CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX, who do not expect to have
their hands shaken.
WINSTON
Tiny, good to see you.
(to ISMAY)
Pug. Welcome to the War Cabinet,
such as we are.
(to ALL)
Please, sit.
He sits.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
War is usually a catalogue of
blunders, and this one is proving
no exception.
(beat)
General - its all yours.
IRONSIDE
You have this morning’s report in
front of you WINSTON
Yes. General IRONSIDE
- if you turn to page 3 Ummm - so on page 3 - are we all
Looking at page 3? - no, the other
document - second paragraph down WINSTON, agitated, reeling from the royal reprimand, taps his
wedding ring finger on the side of his chair impatiently Second?

GREENWOOD

47.
IRONSIDE
Yes, the second--no, page WINSTON can stand it no longer WINSTON
(his patience snapping)
Edmund!--why don’t you just tell us-please--in your own words-- what
kind of mess we are looking at
here. What’s going on?
IRONSIDE
Right. (beat) As of 2200 hours last
night--the Germans have encircled
sixty British, Belgian and French
divisions. On our part all our
forces under Lord Gort have now
withdrawn, or are trying to
withdraw, to the French coast, to
Dunkirk, where we cannot reach them.
Ships sunk by the Nazis block the
harbour entrance and the Luftwaffe
control the skies above.
CHAMBERLAIN
How many of our men are trapped?
IRONSIDE
All of them.
(pause)
Our nation’s entire professional
soldiery. And...
(pause)
...we can see no clear way to
rescue them.
Silence WINSTON
General--are you telling
me that we shall have lost the
British army by the next few days?
IRONSIDE
That’s correct.
ATTLEE
What are the French doing?
IRONSIDE
Premiere Raynaud sent a radio
message. He expects the defence of
Paris will soon fail.

48.
WINSTON
We must counter-attack. Anyone?
(silence)
Surely IRONSIDE
The German forces are superior in
every regard and are only fifty
miles from the coast. They are
pushing us into the sea.
ATTLEE
Fifty miles! Good God!
GREENWOOD
For a German tank, two days.
WINSTON
They must not reach the sea! Not
before we evacuate our men! General
Ismay? What have you got for us?
Everyone looks at ISMAY.
ISMAY
As it stands--I cannot see that
we have much hope of getting any
of our forces out in time.
A gasp in the cabinet.

WINSTON takes this news badly.

WINSTON
Not a man? We cannot be so totally
at their mercy!
REACTION HALIFAX: Only just holding his tongue. He looks at
CHAMBERLAIN, who does not maintain the look.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
General. What is our next step?
IRONSIDE
I’m not sure, sir, that we have one.
Silence. A pall settles. ISMAY looks at IRONSIDE, who says
nothing. CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX also exchange a look.
WINSTON
So? So where are we to look for
salvation?
(silence)
Anyone? Come on! Speak!
IRONSIDE
We still have a Garrison at Calais.
25 miles to the west.

49.
WINSTON
Well why didn’t you say so?! How
many men do we have there?
IRONSIDE
4,000. More or less.
WINSTON
Then have them go east--engage with
the German columns moving on
Dunkirk. Buy us some time. Draw the
Nazi focus away from Dunkirk whilst
we execute a maritime evacuation of
our forces. Ironside--is that
possible?
IRONSIDE
It would mean a huge sacrifice.
ATTLEE
Four thousand young men!
WINSTON
To save 300,000!
(pause)
Under whose command is the Calais
Garrison?
ISMAY
Brigadier Nicholson.
Silence. The burden falls on Winston...
WINSTON
Very well--tell...
A hint of UNCERTAINTY here, as WINSTON taps his SIGNET RING
on the wooden arm of his chair.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
...tell--Nicholson--that it is of
the greatest importance to this
island that his garrison draw the
enemy’s tanks and artillery and
bombers away from Dunkirk--invite
their wrath--and to--to fight on if
needs be until--until the
destruction of his command.
A PALL settles over the room. Almost a GASP.
ATTLEE
It’s suicide.
HALIFAX, emotions rising, can stay silent no longer.

50.
HALIFAX
Prime Minister! I have
reservations...
WINSTON
Who is free of reservations?
HALIFAX
...about such a fateful course when
we have the option of a peace offer.
WINSTON
What peace offer?!
HALIFAX
The Italians have offered to
mediate between ourselves and
Germany. And I indicated that
provided our liberty and
independence were assured, we would
consider any proposal.
WINSTON
With Hitler holding the whip hand
do you really think he would honour
our liberty and independence?
HALIFAX
It would be in his interest to do
so. He WINSTON
The only thing to do is to show
that maniac that he cannot conquer
this country, and for that we need
an army. General, tell Brigadier
Nicholson, “The Germans must not
reach the sea! Not before we get
our boys off that bloody beach!”
(pause)
I take full responsibility.
Really?

HALIFAX

WINSTON
(temper exploding)
REALLY! YES! It is the reason I sit
in this chair!
HALIFAX
Surely--before we send 4,000 men to
their graves, we must explore WINSTON
(frustrated)
What is this?!

51.
HALIFAX
What is your mind on the principle
of peace talks? Do we take it for
example, that you preclude yourself
from even considering engaging in
such negotiations?
A TENSE SILENCE.
ANGLE ON: the TWO SECRETARIES, pencil’s raised, waiting to
record WINSTON’s reply.
WINSTON, aware that history is listening, senses a TRAP

-

WINSTON
I should like to speak to Viscount
Halifax and Mr Chamberlain alone.
(to IRONSIDE)
Issue the order to the Calais
Garrison. Confirm it has been done.
(to BRIDGES)
Bridges! You too! Out! Hop it!
BRIDGES puts down his pencil. Consternation from those
departing at this breach of protocol.
INT. CORRIDOR - WAR ROOMS - DAY
At the end of the line of unneeded WAR CABINET members filing
out, comes the disgruntled BRIDGES with his TWO SECRETARIES.
INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
WINSTON lights his CIGAR, and takes his time, slowly approaching
the HALIFAX seated at the back of the room.
HALIFAX
Winston. We are facing certain
defeat on land--the annihilation of
our army--and imminent invasion!
We must be rational!
WINSTON
We are a sea-going nation. Have
been since the Bronze Age. The
Channel is ours--our moat--our
battlement and the German doesn’t
recognise an expanse of water
greater than a bloody lake! They
have first to reach this island -

52.
HALIFAX
- which will be full of terrified
men, women and children, whom we
have failed, despicably, in our
duty of protection. Germany has won-we are entirely defenceless WINSTON
And who’s fault is that ?!
CHAMBERLAIN averts his face.
HALIFAX
- facing the largest army the world
has seen. Furthermore, once France
falls, Germany can concentrate on
aircraft production and they will
then have the French fleet as well!
What is to stop Hitler then? Words?
Words, Winston? Words alone?
(beat)
If you will not permit any talk
of peace then I will be forced CHAMBERLAIN steps in, to stop Halifax from resigning.
CHAMBERLAIN
Might we not allow Edward simply to
meet the Italian ambassador,
Bastianini--discuss their possible
role as mediators between us and
Germany, and find out their price?
WINSTON is calmed by CHAMBERLAIN’s manner WINSTON
Bastianini? Ha! A man about whom
we might say there is less to him
than meets the eye.
WINSTON looks at HALIFAX, and sighs WINSTON (CONT’D)
I remain opposed to any
negotiations CHAMBERLAIN
- of course WINSTON
- which might lead to a derogation
of our rights and power.
HALIFAX
AS DO WE ALL! There is no question
that our sovereignty is nonnegotiable!

53.

Winston?

CHAMBERLAIN

With nowhere left to turn - WINSTON gives a slow inclination
of the head, and then - NODS.
CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
Good. Thank you.
WINSTON
...but! No-one outside this room
must ever know.
Of course.

CHAMBERLAIN

INT. CORRIDOR - WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
WINSTON walks through the corridors - then approaches and
opens a SMALL LAVATORY DOOR. As he enters CLOSE ON: The door’s lock, which slides from “VACANT” to
“ENGAGED”.
INT. TRANS-ATLANTIC TELEPHONE ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
Inside, it’s no LAVATORY. It is actually - a secret PRIVATE
TELEPHONE SYSTEM, linking WINSTON with the ROOSEVELT WHITE
HOUSE.
WINSTON, seated, holding the receiver, takes a few moments
before he lifts the phone to his ear WINSTON
Mr President?
Winston!

ROOSEVELT

WINSTON
How are you Franklin?
ROOSEVELT
Fine. Fine. How are you Prime
Minister?
WINSTON
I am phoning about--about your Navy
ships. If you were to loan us just
50 of your older Destroyers I feel
sure Ah! Yes!

ROOSEVELT

54.
WINSTON
- even 40 would -

ROOSEVELT (CONT'D)
Well I -

ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
- I did ask around, but just not
possible I’m afraid. The Neutrality
Act we signed last year has tied my
hands. Just can’t swing it. I
tried.
WINSTON
Then--can I--do I have your
permission to send an aircraft
carrier to pick up the P-40 fighter
planes we purchased? Mr President.
ROOSEVELT
(wincing, hating not being
able to help)
You got me there again. New law-preventing trans-shipment of
military equipment.
WINSTON
But we’ve paid for them--with the
money we borrowed from you!
ROOSEVELT
(anguished)
So sorry, Winston.
WINSTON
I need not impress upon you the
trouble faced by the Western
Hemisphere. Without your support,
in some fashion...
Silence. A tense moment...
ROOSEVELT
I know. I know. You are on my
mind day and night.
(pause)
Look. We could--possibly...
But words fail the hampered ROOSEVELT and his voice trails
off.
WINSTON
Mr President--we are facing the
gravest odds!

55.
ROOSEVELT
...we could take your planes to
about a mile from the Canadian
border--and then if you send across
a team of horses from Canada-nothing motorized--then you could
pull 'em over the border yourself.
How does that sound?
WINSTON
Horses? You said “a team of
horses”?
ROOSEVELT
I guess you could push ‘em
yourself. The damn things have
wheels. Up to you.
WINSTON is speechless ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
We could do that.
(silence)
Prime Minister?
WINSTON covers the PHONE, bunches his fist, swallows his
RAGE, and then speaks again, as calmly as he canWINSTON
Anything you can do at this time
would be welcome.
ROOSEVELT
Goodnight to you Winston.
(feeling WINSTON’s pain)
It must be late there?
WINSTON
In more ways than you could
possibly know.
He puts down the phone and sits back in his chair - stunned,
fuming. But as he stews, he slowly - slowly - conceives an
idea, a new IDEA!
INT. MAP ROOM / WAR ROOMS -

NIGHT

WINSTON enters and strides past the staff, making for the
LARGE MAP of EUROPE. He puts his finger on the FRENCH COAST,
at DUNKIRK, encircled by RED THREAD. And then looks at
ENGLAND, the COAST, and then taps DOVER on the map.
He turns, sees the DOZEN colorful TELEPHONES and addresses a
NAVAL MAP-ROOM OFFICER -

56.
WINSTON
Get me Vice-Admiral Ramsay on one
of these.
EXT. DOVER CASTLE

PRE-SUNRISE (5 AM)

HIGH AERIAL of the CASTLE atop the famous WHITE-CLIFFS.
INT. ADMIRAL RAMSAY’S BEDROOM/ TUNNELS/ BENEATH DOVER CASTLE

ADMIRAL RAMSAY is woken by a STAFFER.
STAFFER
Admiral Ramsay?
Huh?

RAMSAY

STAFFER
It’s the Prime Minister.
INT. DYNAMO ROOM/ TUNNELS/ BENEATH DOVER CASTLE - NIGHT
RAMSAY, on the PHONE with WINSTON.
WINSTON (O.S.)
Bertie? I hope I didn’t wake you.
RAMSAY
Of course not. I was just reading
the Bible.
(INTERCUT, as necessary with - )
INT. MAP ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
WINSTON, on a PHONE, studies the COAST of ENGLAND.
WINSTON
Exodus?
(smiles)
We need to evacuate our boys,
Bertie. The Navy is saying that
with one cruiser and six
destroyers, and with the Luftwaffe
controlling the skies above, we'll
be lucky to get 10% out. I want you
to order an assembly of boats.
Boats?

RAMSAY

57.
WINSTON
Yes. Civilian boats, as many as
you can get your hands on.
Country’s full of boats--let’s put
‘em to use. Bertie? You there?
RAMSAY
(sceptical)
Rrrr-ight.
WINSTON
- anyone with a pleasure craft
bigger than 30 foot that can get to
France. Longley's clipper,
Fearnley's gin palace, any halfrotten fishing boat that’ll float.
Mmmm-hmmm.

RAMSAY

WINSTON senses BERTIE’s reticence...and makes a different
appeal...
WINSTON
Help me stage this thing, Bertie.
We must at least try to bring
some of our boys home.
After a pause RAMSAY
I will have the BBC issue the
order.
WINSTON starts to put the phone down, and then remembers
something WINSTON
Oh-- Bertie--still there?
Sir?

RAMSAY

WINSTON
We need a name--for this Operation.
RAMSAY looks around him - a blazon on a generator says
“DYNAMO”.
INT. CORRIDOR/ WAR ROOMS - DAY

CAPTION:

SUNDAY, MAY 26 1940

WINSTON walks with EDEN, but then they pass an OFFICER’s
OFFICE, whose DOOR is open - and it’s then that he hears, to
his fury, the sound of a RADIO playing a SPEECH BY HITLER!
WINSTON PULLS THE DOOR SHUT, silencing the dictator.

58.
WINSTON and EDEN look at each other, then walk on, and stop
before entering the WAR CABINET ROOM, (as if before taking
the stage). WINSTON takes a deep breath and tries to shake
off his worries. Only then does he enter, followed by EDEN INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
WAR CABINET MEETING 2.
PRESENT: 17 PERSONS. The Main War Cabinet (CHURCHILL,
CHAMBERLAIN, HALIFAX, GREENWOOD, ATLEE) and the FOLLOWING
(EDEN, ALEXANDER, SINCLAIR, CADOGAN, ANDERSON, POUND,
DOWDING, IRONSIDE, BRIDGES, ISMAY, NICHOLL, WILKINSON)
A tense atmosphere - faces riven with doubt. The CABINET is
standing, conferring anxiously with each other......but then
fall silent when WINSTON and ANTHONY EDEN enter.
WINSTON
Good day. I’ve asked the Minister
for War to join us.
HALIFAX and CHAMBERLAIN share a look - this doesn’t bode
well.
All sit. WINSTON looks around the table - sees the fear and
doubt and nervousness in his CABINET right away.
WINSTON starts to tap his SIGNET RING on his right hand on
the wooden arm of his chair, until WINSTON (CONT’D)
Obviously--we are in a dangerous
situation. But - I am assured by
the French Premiere that while some
German tank units have reached the
sea, the situation generally seems
to be well in hand.
No-one looks at all convinced by this CLOSE ON: the wooden arm of WINSTON’s chair - the varnish has
worn away from three weeks of such anxious tapping.
GREENWOOD
Prime Minister. You don’t believe
that.
ATTLEE
France will fall.
Yes.

GREENWOOD

ATTLEE
And invasion of this island will
follow.

59.
WINSTON changes the subject WINSTON
What news from Calais?
What?

ATTLEE

IRONSIDE
The Garrison attacked, but was
forced back and is now surrounded
on all sides. They are being
shelled and bombed mercilessly.
Casualties are at sixty percent.
The CABINET all shake their heads - all look to have lost
FAITH in WINSTON.
CHAMBERLAIN nods at HALIFAX HALIFAX
On the question of peace talks

-

WINSTON
- We must hold our nerve. Signal
only that we are going to fight
it out to the end. A peace offer
telegraphs our weakness.
CHURCHILL looks to EDEN for support Agreed.

EDEN

WINSTON
And even if we were beaten--we
should be no worse off than we
should be if we were now to
abandon the struggle.
Let us therefore avoid being
dragged down the slippery slope
with talk of a negotiated peace.
HALIFAX
Slippery slope? The only WINSTON
-I suspect Germany and Italy -

HALIFAX (CONT'D)
-the only slippery slope -

WINSTON
-want to get us so deeply involved
in negotiations that we should be
unable to turn back!
HALIFAX
Oh nonsense! Bastianini informed me-

60.
WINSTON
The approach HALIFAX
- The only slippery slope WINSTON
WILL YOU STOP INTERRUPTING ME
WHILE I AM INTERRUPTING YOU!?
When I chose my War Cabinet I took
great care to surround myself with
old rivals. I may have overdone it.
Only GREENWOOD and ATTLEE and EDEN smile. HALIFAX and
CHAMBERLAIN look exasperated.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Viscount Halifax--the approach you
proposed is not only futile, but
involves us in a deadly danger.
HALIFAX
THE DEADLY DANGER HERE IS THIS
ROMANTIC FANTASY OF FIGHTING TO THE
END!!! What is “the end” if not
the destruction of all?
There is nothing heroic in going
down fighting if it can be avoided.
Nothing even remotely patriotic in
death or glory if the odds are on
the former; nothing inglorious in
trying to shorten a war that we are
clearly losing.
WINSTON cannot bear this talk WINSTON
Europe is still -

HALIFAX (CONT'D)
Europe is lost!

HALIFAX (CONT’D)
And before our forces are wiped out
completely this is the time to
negotiate, in order to obtain the
best conditions possible. It would
not be in Hitler’s interests to
insist on outrageous terms. He will
know his own weaknesses. He will be
reasonable.
WINSTON cannot bear this talk -

61.
WINSTON
When will the lesson be learned?
How many more dictators must be
wooed, appeased--Good God, given
immense privileges, before we
learn!--that you can’t reason
with a tiger when your head is in
its mouth!
WINSTON rises and walks out. HALIFAX, escaping CHAMBERLAIN’s
grip on his forearm, alone chases WINSTON...into INT. SMALL CORRIDOR TO TUNNEL/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
HALIFAX pursues WINSTON into the vestibuleHALIFAX
PRIME MINISTER WINSTON turns back to him - they are now enclosed in the
vestibule.
HALIFAX (CONT’D)
Winston! Yesterday you gave
permission for WINSTON
What permission?
HALIFAX
- for me to meet -

-

HALIFAX (CONT’D)
with Bastianini -

WINSTON
- I sanctioned -

WINSTON (CONT’D)
- the theoretical exWINSTON (CONT'D)
-ploration -

HALIFAX
- theoretical?! -

WINSTON
- of what price Italy would ask. No
more. I did not sanctionHALIFAX
If you will not allow any further
exploration of a peace agreement,
then--you will have my resignation.
WINSTON
Don’t be absurd. I need you
Edward. You know I do!

62.
HALIFAX
I will not stand by to watch
another generation of young men die
at the bloody altar of your hubris!
WINSTON
And you would have us die as lambs!
HALIFAX
Was Gallipoli not enough for you?!
WINSTON
(angry)
How dare you?! Our troops were
chewing barbed wire in Flanders! I
saw it! Opening a second front,
outflanking the Turks, was a
serious military idea - and it
could’ve damn-well worked if - the
Admirals and First Sea Lord hadn’t
dithered away our element of
surprise!
Silence. WINSTON realises he’s gone too far. Totally lost his
poise. He calms himself. But too late. HALIFAX, undaunted,
fixes WINSTON with a cold judicial eye HALIFAX
The choice is yours. You have 24
hours to enter into peace talks, or
I resign.
HALIFAX walks back into the war rooms. WINSTON, regretful for
his display of temper.
INT. HALLWAY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
WINSTON emerges from the ELEVATOR, to find - the YOUNG CONSERVATIVE MP, ERNLE HASTINGS, waiting for him
at the bottom of the stairs.
ERNLE HASTINGS
Prime Minister. I wonder if we
might schedule you to address the
Outer Cabinet?
WINSTON climbs the stairs, without saying a word.
INT. TREASURY TOILETS - DAY
HALIFAX, energized, and CHAMBERLAIN, looking unwell, confer
as CHAMBERLAIN dampens a handkerchief and dabs his head with
cold water...

63.
HALIFAX
I told him. It shook him.
CHAMBERLAIN
Imagine it did.
HALIFAX
Gave him 24 hours--I don’t expect
him to agree, so I will resign
first. You then join me. That’s
critical if we are to trigger a
revolt in the chamber. I’ll
announce it. The King will back us.
HALIFAX nods. CHAMBERLAIN now mentors him, paternally CHAMBERLAIN
Be sure of your motives, Edward.
Country first! Country First
always. Career third, fourth-after family, and church - and,
in your case (small smile) - fox
hunting. Come.
CHAMBERLAIN bravely leads an emotional HALIFAX out of the
BATHROOM.
EXT. WESTMINSTER/ LONDON - NIGHT
HIGH-ANGLE WIDE-SHOT of LONDON - then PAN to reveal RADIO

immediately INT. LIBRARY/ 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
WINSTON listens to the RADIO BROADCAST:
RADIO ANNOUNCER
“- if they have not already been

WINSTON turns off the RADIO, turns to face ELIZABETH LAYTON
who sits at her type-writer, waiting. They look at each
other.

64.
CHURCHILL (CONT'D)
Every hour you continue to exist
is of the greatest help to our
forces at Dunkirk. Have the
greatest possible admiration for
your splendid stand.
Your evacuation however--your
evacuation will not, repeat not,
take place.
Signed...
ELIZABETH LAYTON, has stopped typing.
CHURCHILL, looks up and sees tears in her eyes. He goes to
her, offering a handkerchief.
CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
Here.
(softening)
What is it?
ELIZABETH LAYTON
May I be excused?
CHURCHILL
You may not. Tell me what this
is about.
ELIZABETH LAYTON
No-one tells us anything. It’s all
classified and--we hear scraps and
it’s worse than knowing nothing.
CHURCHILL
What would you like to know?
She stares into his eyes ELIZABETH LAYTON
How many men will survive?
He stares at her - it’s the great PUBLIC QUESTION. It
deserves an answer.
CHURCHILL
Come with me. Come on.
INT. TUNNEL/ BENEATH 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
WINSTON leads ELIZABETH down the long tunnel INT. CORRIDOR/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
-

ELIZABETH follows WINSTON to the MAP-ROOM.
Come in.

CHURCHILL

65.
ELIZABETH
No. I’m not allowed in the Map
Room.
CHURCHILL
You are now.
INT. MAP ROOM/ WAR-ROOMS - NIGHT
She enters the MAP ROOM, which is manned with MALE personnel
who look askance at ELIZABETH. WINSTON shows her the ARMY
MAP of WESTERN EUROPE. The BRITISH FORCES are represented,
surrounded by GERMAN troops at the seaside town of DUNKIRK.
WINSTON
The German army now controls
every French port except Dunkirk,
here--and Calais, here to the west,
where a garrison is drawing fire
and delaying the German advance on
Dunkirk.
She nods.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
At both points our troops are
encircled. We’re still trying to
clear Dunkirk harbour of wrecked
ships so we can then land the boats
we need to get our boys off those
beaches, but enemy planes are
attacking us constantly. Our only
hope in Dunkirk is thick cloud
cover to thwart these attacks, but-the skies remain clear. Even then I
am told we will need a miracle to
get even 10% of our men out.
She is shocked WINSTON (CONT’D)
Courage, Miss Layton--courage.
ELIZABETH
How long have they got if we don’t
rescue them?
WINSTON
One, maybe two days.
ISMAY enters General?

WINSTON (CONT’D)

66.
ISMAY
News from Calais, the 30th
Infantry, sir. They’ve retreated to
the town’s citadel...
As a last and probably hopeless
stand-the order
“Everyman for
himself’ has been given.

(As he exits)
Good.

The CITADEL rises, ancient and proud above the town, as - a GERMAN RECONNAISSANCE PLANE flies a circle over the
CITADEL and lays a CIRCLE OF WHITE SMOKE.

reads the dispatch from CHURCHILL - grim reading. He lowers
it, stricken, afraid, as he hears...the DRONE of 50 GERMAN
BOMBERS rising...coming closer...closer...He looks up into
the dark skies...
EXT. GERMAN BOMBER - NIGHT
From the POV of a GERMAN bomber, at high altitude - the CIRCLE OF SMOKE comes beneath it, and in the middle of
the circle, perfectly targeted far below, the CITADEL.
Into the CIRCLE of SMOKE the BOMBER drops its PAYLOAD.
INT. MAP ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
ECU on: WINSTON’s EYES, as if -while staring at the map- he
is witness to this defeat...
EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT
The BOMBS fall on the town, and at last the CITADEL itself
takes a DIRECT HIT. It crumbles, and falls...

67.
INT. WINSTON’S STUDY / 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
ECU ON: A MILITARY DISPATCH, that reads:
CALAIS FALLEN. NUMBERS OF DEAD OR CAPTURED UNCERTAIN.
GENERAL GORT.
Across the room, WINSTON is at his desk, immobile, nursing a
glass of whiskey and soda, as, - CLEMMIE enters - and looks at him, with concern.
CLEMMIE
(worried)
Go to bed, Pig.
He gives no reply CLEMMIE (CONT’D)
You must sleep.
WINSTON
Leave me, Clemmie.
CLEMMIE
The opportunity for doing so
passed a long time ago.
She gets an idea, and exits urgently, leaving him alone.
INT. OFFICE/ 10 DOWNING STREET - MORNING
WINSTON, in his SILK ROBE, still sits at his desk. The
curtains are drawn. It’s MORNING. He walks to a TELEPHONE and
dials - ADMIRAL RAMSAY.
WINSTON
Bertie--what’s been the response?
EXT. BATTLEMENTS/ DOVER CASTLE - DAY
ANGLE ON: 5 SMALL CRAFT, arriving at DOVER - a packet boat, a
yacht, a fishing boat, a skiff...
ANGLE ON: RAMSAY, talking into a FIELD TELEPHONE, watching
from atop DOVER CASTLE.
ADMIRAL RAMSAY
It will take time. It’s too soon
to judge.
WINSTON
How many boats so far?
ADMIRAL RAMSAY
It will take time.

68.
WINSTON
The request for civilian boats
was not a request, Bertie.
It was an order!
In frustration, WINSTON slams down the PHONE, as - SAWYERS, the VALET, enters and draws the curtains. As LIGHT
floods the room--

CAPTION:

MONDAY, MAY 27, 1940

EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
A CROWD of ON-LOOKERS are gathered there, as - WINSTON, emerges to get into a GOVERNMENT CAR. He is angstridden now, gives the (POLITE) V-FOR-VICTORY SIGN, (PALM-OUT)
but his heart isn’t in it. Hunch-backed, his eyes downcast,
he gets in his GOVERNMENT CAR.
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
WINSTON and the KING at lunch at a DINING TABLE. WINSTON eats
heartily. The KING, with little appetite, smokes, watches
WINSTON wash down the food with hearty gulp of champagne.
GEORGE VI
(pours drinks)
How do you manage drinking during
the day?
Practice.

WINSTON

After another silence GEORGE VI
I have been asked--if plans should
be drawn--to evacuate my f-family
and I--to Canada. I wish to know
the opinion of our prime minister.
WINSTON
My opinion? My opinion would be
that you must do what you feel is
right for yourself, your family,
and for the country. Your survival
is paramount. Prime Ministers--we
seem to come and go at an
astonishing rate.
GEORGE VI
Your--p-position in parliament,
I hear, is not strong.

69.
WINSTON
My party resents how Chamberlain
was pushed aside. And many others
doubt me. I was not a popular
choice.
The KING nods - he himself resented WINSTON - and he turns
away briefly, in embarrassment.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
They want Halifax still. But why
get rid of the organ grinder and
replace him with the monkey.
GEORGE VI
Lord Halifax is a close personal
friend of mine!
WINSTON
I am unwanted. I’ve never been
trusted since the Gallipoli
campaign. Unwanted.
GEORGE VI
Perhaps--it is because--you scare
people.
Who?!

WINSTON

GEORGE VI
You scare me.
WINSTON
(scarily)
What?! What nonsense!
What could be scary about me?
GEORGE VI
One never knows what is going to
come out of your mouth next.
Something that w-will flatter-or wound.
WINSTON
My emotions are unbridled.
WINSTON drops some meat into the mouth of a CORGIE waiting at
WINSTON’s feet for food.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
A wildness. In the blood. I share
it with my father.
(beat)
Mother also. We lack the gift of-temperance.

70.
GEORGE VI
Were you close--to your parents?
WINSTON
My mother was glamorous--but
perhaps too widely loved.
This draws an eye-brow rise from the King.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
My father--to me was like God-busy elsewhere.
The KING smiles. He cannot help but like this man.
INT. CORRIDOR/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
WINSTON walks through the MEN and WOMEN en route to his OFFICE.
He stops before ELIZABETH LAYTON - looks into her eyes. She can
see the DOUBT, the SADNESS, the PAIN.
WINSTON
Miss Layton.
Sir.

ELIZABETH LAYTON

WINSTON
Reach--I need to reach--speak to...
To?
3pm.
3pm, sir?

ELIZABETH LAYTON
WINSTON
ELIZABETH LAYTON

WINSTON
Ask Bridges to summon the--the uh-the War Cabinet for 3pm. Thank you.
She watches him walk away - only for WINSTON to be stopped by JOHN EVANS with a
COMMUNIQUE.
Sir!

JOHN EVANS

WINSTON
What is it?
JOHN EVANS
Sir-from Lord Gort, in France.

71.
WINSTON reads the message -- his EYES WIDEN.
WINSTON
Belgium has fallen. They will
surrender at midnight. France
will soon follow suit.
REACTION WINSTON: Shock.
INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
WAR CABINET MEETING 3.
PRESENT: 9 PERSONS. The Main War Cabinet (CHURCHILL,
CHAMBERLAIN, HALIFAX, GREENWOOD, ATLEE) and the FOLLOWING
(EDEN, CADOGAN, IRONSIDE, BRIDGES.)
A FILM REEL is projected onto a SCREEN. We see images of
GERMAN SPEEDBOATS. We see the NAZI leadership, holding maps,
pointing out to sea toward Britain...We see a giant LONGRANGE SUPER CANNON being revealed by GERMAN soldiers. Over
this, we hear IRONSIDE
We have received reports that the
most probable method of attack,
which Germany might employ against
this country, is a large fleet of
fast motor boats, possibly up to
200, carrying 100 men apiece to
carry out a seaborne raid on a
large scale. By this means a
considerable force of the enemy
could be landed at many points on
the coast simultaneously with airborne raids inland. We do not feel
that by naval or air action we
could prevent such a landing.
HALIFAX
Could you repeat that?
HALIFAX turns to look hard at WINSTON.
IRONSIDE
We must prepare for the imminent
invasion of our island.
The shock registers on all the faces. Hold on ANTHONY EDEN, as
he lowers his HEAD.
BRIDGES opens a BOTTLE of WHISKEY and starts to pour into
tumblers for the non-military personnel.
Silence, as IRONSIDE sits.

72.
Silence. Lost looks. General state of high anxiety. They look
to WINSTON for leadership - and he appears to be about to say
something in response to this black news - BUT NO WORDS COME.
After this awkward silence - HALIFAX looks directly at
WINSTON HALIFAX
Let the record state--that I have
received word from the Italian
Embassy in London that Italy is
prepared to mediate a resolution
between Britain, its Allies, and
Germany.
The CABINET SECRETARY, records this statement for history.
WINSTON fumes that this has been put on the record and stares
with anger at HALIFAX.
WINSTON has been totally put on the spot!
WINSTON
(sunk by the news)
Perhaps--then-The CABINET waits on the final INEVITABLE words WINSTON (CONT’D)
--the time for such an offer from
us is HALIFAX nods at CHAMBERLAIN - success, surely! But WINSTON still
can’t speak the words they ache to hear.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
- is when Germany has made an
unsuccessful attempt to invade this
country.
HALIFAX throws his GLASSES on the table in DISBELIEF!
CHAMBERLAIN
Unsuccessful?!
HALIFAX
Then you leave me no other option CHAMBERLAIN
(cutting him off)
Winston--you are refusing to grasp
the realities of how precarious our
position is! Our entire army is
about to be wiped out! Terms!
Must! Be struck!
Silence. WINSTON has no room left in which to move. ALL FACES
examine his.

73.
WINSTON looks finally to ANTHONY EDEN - his staunchest
supporter.
Anthony?

WINSTON

EDEN’s face is pained - as he retains a MEANINGFUL SILENCE.
CHURCHILL looks to each MAN around the room, and their faces
proclaim their support of HALIFAX’s view.
UTTERLY ISOLATED - WINSTON has no choice now.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Then...
(pause)
Then it seems...
(pause)
...we have no choice but to at least
consider the path of negotiation.
CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX share an astonished look!
WINSTON (CONT’D)
If Hitler’s peace terms are-overlordship of Central Europe and
return of certain German colonies (pause)
- and if he will leave us our
independence, then - then I would
be thankful to get out of our
present difficulties. It’s quite
unlikely that he will make any such
offer, but...
WINSTON looks at the CABINET SECRETARY who records for
posterity his every word WINSTON (CONT’D)
...if I were told what the German
terms were, then--I would be-prepared---to--to consider them.
The SECRETARY notes down this historic concession, and
WINSTON observes this.
HALIFAX
Thank you. Prime Minister.
CHAMBERLAIN nods at HALIFAX. They have prevailed.
HALIFAX (CONT’D)
(triumphant)
I shall prepare a draft memorandum
at once.
Finally, WINSTON nods.
other again - victory!

CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX look at each

74.
EXT. TREASURY DRUM - DAY
HIGH WIDE-SHOT as WINSTON walks through the TREASURY DRUM
toward DOWNING STREET.
MILES ALDRIDGE, a lone photographer calls out MILES ALDRIDGE
Mr. Churchill! One picture, one
picture, come on sir, one picture!
How about a smile, Prime Minister?
WINSTON steps toward him, and then DELIBERATELY gives the
RUDE VERSION of the V-FOR-VICTORY sign (PALM-INWARD). Winston
walks on.
INT. BATHROOM/ TREASURY - DAY
CHAMBERLAIN, alone, steadies himself against a wall - his
health is fading. He takes out his bottle of MORPHINE and
drinks.
INT/EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
KING GEORGE walks out on to a BALCONY and looks down the MALL
in BLACKOUT, as his EQUERRY joins him...
GEORGE VI
I was--ju--just imagining never
standing--here again. Perhaps
because I am no longer alive, or-or because the palace itself-- is
gone.
EQUERRY
Canada. You must decide, sir. You
could rule in exile.
GEORGE VI
Truly? Is that my fate?
(pause)
You know what? I feel angry. In
this moment I’m aware of feeling-bloody angry.
The EQUERRY studies him, as he studies the MALL.
INT. ELIZABETH’S “SHOE-BOX” ROOM/

WAR ROOMS - NIGHT

ELIZABETH LAYTON waits, her fingers at the ready. She sneaks
a glance at the CLOCK on her DESK - it is 1.30!
WINSTON is in a BLACK MOOD. He struggles to DICTATE a
SPEECH...

75.
WINSTON
I have...come to...to
wonder...in... recent
days...whether it was...my duty...
ECU of: the TYPEWRITER hammers typing “duty” WINSTON (CONT’D)
- to consider...
EVANS enters, carrying a TRAY holding a glass and a bottle.
Elizabeth yawns.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
...consider...entering...
EVANS is standing there staring at WINSTON, waiting to knock
off for the night. WINSTON notices JOHN EVANS
Will that be all for tonight, sir?
WINSTON ignores him.
WINSTON
...entering into negotiations
with...
(unable to speak the
dreaded name)
...that...corporal...no...
EVANS departs without an answer, as - WINSTON pours himself a
SCOTCH and mumbles to himself WINSTON (CONT’D)
...gangster--no--tyrant...
...monster of wickedness, no...
WINSTON, wanting more inspiration, turns over a NEWSPAPER and
on the COVER is - a LARGE PHOTO of ADOLPH HITLER. WINSTON
looks at HITLER’S FACE with LOATHING WINSTON (CONT’D)
...butcher--no good--monstrous
savage?--bloodthirsty guttersnipe!-housepainter...
(throws newspaper on the
ground)
HOUSEPAINTER!
(his head clears)
Where were we? Where - ?
WINSTON, hearing no sound of typing, turns - and sees
ELIZABETH LAYTON staring at her TYPEWRITER, frozen Well?

WINSTON (CONT’D)

76.
ELIZABETH
(softly)
I didn’t understand you, sir.
He doesn’t reply. She finally adds You were Were?

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
WINSTON

ELIZABETH
You were - mumbling.
Mumbling.
Yes sir.

WINSTON
ELIZABETH

WINSTON, crosses to the other side of her and sits down -he
picks up a FRAMED PHOTO of A HANDSOME YOUNG SOLDIER from her
desk.
Your beau?

WINSTON

ELIZABETH maintains her composure with true grit during the
following exchange ELIZABETH
My brother.
WINSTON
Where is he now?
ELIZABETH
He was falling back on Dunkirk but
he never made it.
This rocks WINSTON to the core. He studies ELIZABETH, stirred
by the beauty of her sad face.
What?

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)

His eyes moisten - at all she represents, innocence and loss
and courage and purity.
WINSTON
I’m just looking at you.
She turns back to her TYPE-WRITER and sits there waiting,
until - feeling awkward - she offers ELIZABETH
Shall I read back what we have?

77.

Please.

WINSTON

ELIZABETH
“I have come to wonder in recent
days whether it was my duty to
consider entering into negotiations-with...”
WINSTON ponders his next line - but again, NO WORDS COME.
With...
EXT. ROOF TOP/

WINSTON

DEFENCE MINISTRY - NIGHT

WINSTON emerges on to the ROOFTOP of the building, and
proceeds to LIGHT UP a CIGAR as he takes in the CLEAR NIGHT
SKY above him.
...with...

WINSTON (O.S.)

He then hears a DRONE... it is a SINGLE SPITFIRE on NIGHT
PATROL. It comes into view, slowly crossing the sky.
WINSTON watches this GHOSTLY SIGHT come and go. The little
plane looks very small in such a big expanse of sky...
His eyes are WET with TEARS, as he ANGRILY GRINDS OUT his
CIGAR.
The CAMERA rises up - up - into an AERIAL SHOT of - WINSTON on the ROOF until - WINSTON is no bigger than a TOY
LEAD SOLDIER.
INT. SPARE ROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
CLEMMIE enters and sees - WINSTON, sitting on a large boatshaped bed in the dark staring into space, amid UNPACKED
BOXES. He’s at a very low ebb.
CLEMMIE
Darling, Winston, Darling?
No answer. She goes to him. He’s clearly in trouble I -

WINSTON

CLEMMIE
Shhh. Shhh. You’ve the full weight
of the world on your shoulders. But
these inner battles, darling -

78.

I can’t -

WINSTON

CLEMMIE
- I know, I know - but they have
actually trained you for this
moment. You are strong because you
are imperfect. You are wise because
you have doubts. From this
uncertainty the wisest words will
come. Now. I will let him in.
Who?
The King.

WINSTON
CLEMMIE

WINSTON
Which King? Our King?
CLEMMIE
Well if it isn’t him, it’s a
wonderful impersonation.
CLEMMIE closes the door. WINSTON looks DISHEVELLED, his suit
RUMPLED. A Mess. He makes a small effort to tuck in a shirt
and buttons his waistcoat.
KING GEORGE VI enters - the most ‘proper’ man in Europe. The
height of manners and decorum. Wears an IMPECCABLE SUIT.
KING GEORGE VI
Mr Churchill--I hope you can for-give the late hour but your wife
thought tonight would be a good
time.
Winston is standing by the bed.
KING GEORGE VI (CONT’D)
Shall we sit?
The KING sits in an ARMCHAIR. Winston sits on the bed.
WINSTON makes a futile effort to put on his public face...
WINSTON
Something to drink? Er KING GEORGE VI
No, thank you.
WINSTON remains seated on the edge of the bed.
KING GEORGE VI (CONT’D)
I received a visit...

79.

From?

WINSTON

KING GEORGE VI
Viscount Halifax.
(beat)
It appears--the prospect of a peace
deal with Hitler--has increased
dramatically.
WINSTON
Later today I will address The
House. The war cabinet is drafting
a letter to Mussolini, asking him
to broker talks with Herr Hitler.
GEORGE VI
Then Halifax was correct.
WINSTON
I should like to know your mind.
GEORGE VI
It would be helpful to know yours
first.
WINSTON
Mine? I should like to know it
myself.
(beat)
Nations which go down fighting rise
again, but those which surrender
tamely are finished.
Belgium?
Collapsed.
Norway -

GEORGE VI
WINSTON
GEORGE VI

WINSTON
Holland. France any hour.
After a hard silence GEORGE VI
And the mood of parliament?
WINSTON
Fear. Panic.
GEORGE VI
And are you not afraid? At all?

80.
WINSTON
I am most terribly.
GEORGE VI scrutinizes him closely WINSTON (CONT’D)
Our defeat in France is the most
crushing in the history of the
Empire. Support among my party for
a campaign of resistance has
collapsed.
Finally - GEORGE has heard what he has wanted to hear, and so
makes his pledge - He moves to sit next to Winston on the bed
GEORGE VI
You have my support.
WINSTON cannot believe his ears.
WINSTON
Your Majesty?
GEORGE VI
You have my support.
(pause)
I must confess, I had some
reservations about you at-at first.
And while some in this country
might have dreaded your
appointment, none dreaded it likelike Adolph Hitler.
WINSTON - speechless.
GEORGE VI (CONT’D)
Whomever can strike fear into that
brute heart is worthy of all our
trust. We shall work together. You
shall have my support. At any hour.
(passionate)
Beat the buggers.
WINSTON
I fear I may be defeated.
GEORGE VI
You--you once gave me some advice.
Perhaps I can give you some. Go to
the people. Let them instruct you.
Quite silently, they usually do.
But tell them the truth.
Unvarnished.
WINSTON
I shall speak to parliament, but
without support in my own party, I
must sue for peace.

81.
GEORGE VI
You warned us this day was coming.
We failed to listen to you. Lift us
up, Mr Churchill.
WINSTON
On certain matters I have few
people with whom I can talk
frankly.
GEORGE VI
Perhaps now we have each other?
WINSTON
I no longer scare you?
GEORGE VI
Only a little. I can cope.
WINSTON
Yes you can. Your majesty.
They remain sitting there, side by side on the boat-shaped
bed, friends hereafter.

ENGLISH COASTLINE, complete with the “DYNAMO” FLEET.
EXT/INT. PRINCES STREET/ WINSTON’S CAR - DAY
WIDE SHOT of - WINSTON’s CAR, moving slowly through the rainy
street. WINSTON, in the back seat, looks out the window at
the human traffic - seems like he’s in a gold-fish bowl,
disconnected. He watches as - MEN IN BOWLER HATS and YOUNG
WOMEN in SUMMER DRESSES walk to work. As they rush through
the rain shielding themselves with umbrellas and newspapers.
WINSTON, with an UNLIT CIGAR in his mouth, searches his
pockets for a MATCH. But he can’t find his matches.
When the CAR stops at a RED LIGHT - TOM LEONARD hears the car door slam. He turns, looks back,
WINSTON has jumped out of his car. Tom Leonard opens his door
and stands looking around for Winston, as crowds rush past in
the pouring rain.

The CROWD of COMMUTERS parts to reveal WINSTON, closely studying the UNDERGROUND MAP, trying to work
it out, until he is RECOGNISED for the FIRST TIME.

83.
A great commotion starts, as people watch respectfully their
PRIME MINISTER trying to work out how to use the TUBE.
ANGLE ON: WINSTON, studying the MAP, lighting a CIGAR, as - a TEENAGE GIRL stands beside him. She looks at the MAP too.
WINSTON notices her.
WINSTON
Do you know how to use this thing?
TEENAGE GIRL
(recognising him, her eyes
widen)
- yes sir.
Yes

WINSTON
So--tell me--how do I get to
Westminster?
TEENAGE GIRL
Westminster? Um, the District Line.
East. One stop.
WINSTON
District Line. East. One stop.
Doesn’t sound so hard.
No, sir.

TEENAGE GIRL

WINSTON stalks off, taking the steps down, down. Now everyone
is stopping to let him go by - PEOPLE are STUNNED SPEECHLESS.
INT. PLATFORM/ DISTRICT LINE EASTBOUND/ ST JAMES PARK TUBE - DAY
WINSTON arrives on the PLATFORM as a TRAIN arrives. The busy
CHATTER dies down at once - as everyone recognizes WINSTON.
WINSTON
So--this is the Underground!
He BOARDS.
INT. DISTRICT LINE TRAIN - DAY
He boards the TRAIN with an UNLIT CIGAR in his mouth. COMMUTERS
look up and FALL SILENT at once, all RISING to their feet, as if
a Lady has entered a room.
WINSTON tips his HAT to them.

WINSTON
What are you all staring at? Have
you never seen a Prime Minister
ride on the Underground before.
When he sits, the COMMUTERS follow suit.
The TRAIN doesn’t immediately start going.

He waits. Then he

EVERYBODY is doing their best to be well mannered and not stare,
but all are failing! They immediately avert their eyes from
WINSTON. WINSTON remembers his unlit CIGAR WINSTON (CONT’D)
Does anyone have a match?
Down the CARRIAGE an OLD MAN shakes a box of matches. WINSTON
rises and goes to him. The OLD MAN strikes a match on the
THIRD STRIKE. With a SHAKING HAND he lights WINSTON’s CIGAR.
Thank you.

WINSTON (CONT’D)

WINSTON offers his hand...
WINSTON (CONT’D)
What is your name?
OLD MAN
Oliver Wilson, sir.
WINSTON
And what do you do Mr Wilson?
OLD MAN
Brick-layer, sir.
WINSTON
Good!

We shall have great need of bricklayers soon! Business will be
looking up!
The GROUP laughs, as - the TRAIN lurches into MOTION.
Progress!

WINSTON (CONT’D)

The mood of REVERENCE lightens now, as WINSTON goes to - a WOMAN WITH A BABY, touches its head.
How old?

WINSTON (CONT’D)

Very.

Some people say it’s a lost cause.

Lost causes are the only ones worth

Fight.

And what--what if I put it to you

Never.

And the temples of his gods.”
Everyone is moved. WINSTON, himself, has tears in his eyes.
He wipes his eyes with a handkerchief.
YOUNG GIRL
Are you crying?
WINSTON
I blub a lot. You’ll have
to get used to it.
The TRAIN stops.

All are actively discussing the wording of a PEACE OFFER.
HALIFAX, leading the formulation of the offer, looks very
pleased with the current situation.
HALIFAX
The Memorandum--titled “Suggested
Approaches to Italy”--is as
follows...
CADOGAN
“If Signor Mussolini will cooperate with us in securing a
settlement of all European
questions which safeguard the
independence and security of the
allies...”
CAMERA moves in on: WINSTON’s SILVER BOX OF MATCHES.
EXT

HOUSE OF COMMONS - DAY

WINSTON comes up from WESTMINSTER TUBE STATION and crosses to
PARLIAMENT.
CADOGAN (O.S.)
“...and could be the basis of a
just and durable peace for Europe,
we will undertake at once to
discuss, with the desire to find
solutions, the matters in which
Signor Mussolini is primarily
interested...”
INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - WESTMINISTER HALL - DAY
Deep in anxious thought, WINSTON stalks in to the House of
Commons and walks down a long hallway....

89.
CADOGAN ((O.S.)
..”We understand that he desires
the solution of certain
Mediterranean questions: and if he
will state in secrecy what these
are, France and Great Britain will
at once do their best to meet those
wishes”.
INT. STAIRS AND CORRIDORS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
To the first floor and is met by a relieved JOHN EVANS JOHN EVANS
Sir! The War Cabinet is waiting!
WINSTON
I am due to address the Outer
Cabinet. I haven’t spoken to them
since the formation of the new
government.
Moving up the HALLWAY, WINSTON and EVANS pass huddled groups
of YOUNGER MP’s WINSTON STOPS, thinks, and then turns back to them.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Good day.
(pause)
I am--about to speak to my Outer
Cabinet in my rooms and--I extend
the invitation to any of you who
would care to join them.
WINSTON forces a SMILE, then departs.
After a moment, the MP’s rise, look at each other, murmur,
rise and follow him.
INT. COMMITTEE ROOM/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
The ROOM is now FULL with 40 MEN - CABINET MEMBERS and YOUNG
BACK-BENCHERS.
WINSTON enters, with JOHN EVANS - shakes the hand of YOUNG
CONSERVATIVE MP (ERNLE HASTINGS).
The DOORS are CLOSED.
WINSTON stands in front of the GATHERING.
They wait for him to speak.
At first no words come from WINSTON, and then -

90.
WINSTON
Later today--I will address the
House on the matter of our nation’s
security.
(silence)
At this very moment the War Cabinet
is drafting papers that lay out our
willingness to enter into peace
talks with Herr Hitler, via his
lacky, Signor Mussolini.
(pause)
I have thought carefully in these
last days--whether (pause)
-whether it was part of my duty-to consider entering into
negotiations with (beat)
- that Man.
He puts on his GLASSES and takes out a MATCH-BOOK - on which
is written the names of the people he met in the Underground.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
But then I spoke--with Oliver
Wilson (starts to read names from
his matchbook)
- Mrs Jessie Sutton, Mrs Abigail
Walker...
ANGLE ON: the CARD. The names of the TUBE COMMUTERS are all
written there...
REACTION: MP’s, slight confusion as they try to remember who
these people are...
WINSTON (CONT’D)
...Marcus Peters, Agnes Dillon,
Maurice Baker, Alice Simpson, and
Miss Margaret Jerome--brave, good,
true citizens of this kingdom--and
they argued, strongly, that it was
idle to think that, if we tried to
make peace now, we should get
better terms than if we fought it
out. The Germans, Mr Baker felt,
would demand - in the name of
disarmament - our naval bases, and
much else. And I think he’s right.
Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,
believes we should then become a
slave state, though a British
Government - which would be
Hitler's puppet - would be set up under Mosley or some such person.

91.

No!

ERNLE HASTINGS

WINSTON
And I join with them in asking a
further question, a question I put
to you: where should we be at the
end of all that?
He SURVEYS their silent UNCERTAIN FACES.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
(silence)
Perhaps some might benefit--the
powerful might be able to parlay
good terms--preserved in their
country redoubts, out of sight of
the Swastika flying on Buckingham
Palace, over Windsor, draped on
these very buildings Never!

BACK-BENCHER 1

WINSTON
So I come to you--to learn your
minds in this grave hour.
The FACES of the MP’s are RESOLUTE, MOVED, READY TO FIGHT.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
You see, we do still have immense
reserves and advantages...
A NOISE begins to build in the room, mumbling, turning into
shouts, over which WINSTON must shout WINSTON (CONT’D)
...and it was pointed out to me (holding up list of names
from Underground)
- by my new friends--that you might
even rise up and tear me down were
I for one moment to contemplate
parley or surrender.
A spontaneous round of emotional applause. It surprises
WINSTON. It surprises even those who are applauding.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
Were they wrong?
NO! NO!

ALL

WINSTON
Then...then...then -

92.
The DIN dies down. When silence returns...
WINSTON (CONT’D)
- then--it appears to be your will
also, that if this long island
story of ours is to end at last,
then it should only be (pause, then powerfully -)
- when each one of us lies choking
in his own blood upon the ground!
A GIANT HOORAY goes up and the YOUNG MPs RUSH UP to WINSTON,
who is soon SWAMPED by MPs shaking his HAND, PATTING HIM on
the back - a MASSIVE SIGN OF SUPPORT.
INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
WINSTON somberly addresses the WAR CABINET (plus ANTHONY EDEN).
WINSTON
And when I asked to know their
minds there occurred a
demonstration which, considering
the character of the gathering,
quite surprised me. There is no
doubt that if we falter at all in
the leading of the nation we
should all be hurled out of office.
I am sure now that every Minister on
both sides of the house is ready to
be killed quite soon, and have all
his family and possessions
destroyed, rather than give in. In
this they represent almost all the
people. It falls to me in these
coming days and months to express
their sentiments. There shall be no
negotiated peace...
(to HALIFAX)
..and you must each do now as you
see fit.
(beat)
I must now address parliament, and
I’m yet to write a word of my
speech.
WINSTON grabs his SILVER BOX OF MATCHES left earlier on the
table WINSTON (CONT’D)
There’s the buggers.
- then walks out, passing the tall IRONSIDE, and clapping him on
the shoulder.
“Tiny”.

WINSTON (CONT’D)

93.
GENERAL IRONSIDE - having his war at last - smiles.
Sir.

IRONSIDE

EDEN happily follows his LEADER now.
REACTION: HALIFAX. BETRAYAL.
CHAMBERLAIN avoids HALIFAX’s eyes.
ATTLEE and GREENWOOD smile.
INT. CORRIDOR - WAR ROOMS / ELIZABETH’S ROOM - DAY
WINSTON walks toward ELIZABETH LAYTON’s “Shoe-Box” room,
knocks, opens the door, remains in the doorway WINSTON
Miss Layton?
ELIZABETH looks up from her work Sir?

ELIZABETH

WINSTON
I’m in need of you.
INT. WAR CABINET ROOM - DAY
HALIFAX detains CHAMBERLAIN as the CABINET leaves the meeting HALIFAX
We must both now resign. Force a
vote of no confidence. I have your
word?
CHAMBERLAIN
Let us--let us go to the Commons
first. Join our colleagues. And
speak after the Prime Minister’s
address.
CHAMBERLAIN takes his coat and leaves HALIFAX worried.
INT. BEDROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
CLEMMIE is getting dressed, and then turns to look at herself
in the mirror, and reveal -

that she is in UNIFORM (Red Cross).

94.
CLEMMIE
(to her reflection)
Here lies a woman, who is always
tired--for she lived in a world
where too much was required.
EXT. PARLIAMENT - DAY
CAMERA moves in on WINSTON’S PARKED CAR, and we gradually
hear the sound of - TYPING.
Through the WINDOW of the CAR we finally see WINSTON, dictating to ELIZABETH LAYTON, her TYPE-WRITER on
her knee going clack, clack, clack. (WINSTON gesticulates as
he composes the crucial words.)
INT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
WINSTON addresses a PACKED HOUSE of COMMONS. A CROWD of some
FIVE HUNDRED listen, with more in the GALLERY. Among the
GALLERY crowd, JOHN EVANS.
ELIZABETH LAYTON arrives late, and learns over the hand-rail,
looking down anxiously at WINSTON, as he launches his final assault WINSTON
Turning once again--to the question
of invasion--I would observe that
there has never been a period in
all these long centuries of which
we boast, when an absolute
guarantee against invasion could
have been given to our people.
ANGLE ON: HALIFAX, in the GALLERY, keenly watching.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
I have, myself--full confidence
that if all do their duty, if
nothing is neglected, and if the
best arrangements are made, as they
are being made, we shall prove
ourselves once more able to defend
our island home, to ride out the
storm of war, and to outlive the
menace of tyranny INT. LIVING ROOM/ DOWNING STREET - DAY
CLEMMIE, in her UNIFORM, listens to WINSTON’s broadcast on
the RADIO, as she has her portrait photographed by CECIL
BEATON. She is awkward in front of the camera.

95.
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
The KING smokes as he listens to the same broadcast.
INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER - DAY
WINSTON
- if necessary for years, if
necessary alone. At any rate, that
is what we are going to try to do.
That is the resolve of His
Majesty's Government – every man of
them. That is the will of
Parliament and the nation.
The British Empire and the French
Republic, linked together in their
cause and in their need, will
defend to the death their native
soil, aiding each other like good
comrades to the utmost of their
strength.
ANGLE ON: ELIZABETH, who is “mouthing” these words, some of
which she already knows by heart WINSTON (CONT’D)
Even though large tracts of Europe
and many old and famous States have
fallen or may fall into the grip of
the Gestapo and all the odious
apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall
not flag or fail.
We shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France--we shall
fight on the seas and oceans, we
shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air, we
shall defend our island - whatever
the cost may be. We shall fight on
the beaches, we shall fight on the
landing grounds, we shall fight in
the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills; We shall
never surrender, and if, which I do
not for a moment believe, this
island or a large part of it were
subjugated and starving, then our
Empire beyond the seas, armed and
guarded by the British Fleet, would
carry on the struggle, until, in
God's good time, the New World,
with all its power and might, steps
forth to the rescue and the
liberation of the old!

96.
The LABOUR BENCHES begin to wave their papers in the air and
call their approval, (it is against Parliamentary etiquette
to ever clap in the House of Commons).
WINSTON’S children bang their hands on the woodwork.
WINSTON’s CONSERVATIVE colleagues all look to CHAMBERLAIN.
CLOSE ON: HALIFAX, looking down from the GALLERY at
CHAMBERLAIN, closes his eyes, knowing what is coming next - CHAMBERLAIN TAKES OUT HIS WHITE HANDKERCHIEF, and tamps
his forehead with it. It’s enough. The CONSERVATIVE
FACTION, ignited, rises to their feet in THUNDEROUS SUPPORT
of WINSTON.
REACTION HALIFAX: Defeat.
WINSTON turns to ANTHONY EDEN, registering surprise at the
strength of support, and winks EDEN grins and SHAKES his FRIEND’s HAND.
EDEN
Changed your mind?
WINSTON
Those who never change their mind
never change anything.
The UPROAR in the HOUSE continues, those in the gallery begin
to throw their parliamentary papers into the air which then
rain down into the chamber.
STANHOPE
What just happened?
HALIFAX
He just mobilized the English
language--and sent it into battle.
Every man is on his feet waving their parliamentary papers
and throwing them into the air, shouting and stamping.
Smiling with due deference WINSTON takes up his things and
walks down the central aisle of the house as papers continue
to rain down from the gallery like ticker tape or confetti.
As the GREAT DOORS of the COMMONS close behind him - the
screen becomes BLACK.
Up with END CAPTIONS:

97.
ALMOST ALL OF THE 300,000 TROOPS AT DUNKIRK
WERE CARRIED HOME BY WINSTON'S CIVILIAN FLEET
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN DIED SIX MONTHS LATER
VISCOUNT HALIFAX WAS SOON REMOVED BY WINSTON
FROM THE WAR CABINET AND SENT TO WASHINGTON
ON MAY 8, FIVE YEARS LATER,
BRITAIN AND ITS ALLIES WOULD DECLARE VICTORY
WITHIN WEEKS OF VICTORY, CHURCHILL AND HIS PARTY WERE
VOTED OUT OF OFFICE BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE.
"SUCCESS IS NOT FINAL, FAILURE IS NOT FATAL: IT IS THE
COURAGE TO CONTINUE THAT COUNTS."
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Roll End Credits.
