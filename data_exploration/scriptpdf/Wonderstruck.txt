BLACKNESS
Rising up WE HEAR:
The sound of a boy’s panting while he runs. His footsteps
crunching. Faster and faster, louder and louder.
SUDDENLY 1

EXT. SNOWY MINNESOTA WOODS - 1977 - NIGHT

1

The roar of some terrifying creature. We are close to the
BOY, age twelve, racing through the snowy dark. He is
terrified. He manages to glance back behind him.
In a shaky dark swirl we catch glimpses of what appear to be
animals, black against the blue snow, chasing after him. In a
glimpse of light their eyes flash, revealing TWO WOLVES tearing through the moonlit woods.
The boy tries desperately to pick up speed, dodging fallen
limbs and rocks along his way. Strangely, he’s barefoot, in a
thin tank-top and pajama bottoms, running through a dark,
eerie landscape.
Up ahead he sees a way to veer off from the path and dip down
along an incline. He takes the turn, tearing through brush as
he descends along the side of a hill into a slight recess,
hoping to drop out of sight.
Through the black mesh of trees he spots the wolves running
past. In relief, he exhales loudly, catching his breath. Then
he pulls himself up. He turns - and gasps.
The two wolves have reverted course and are racing right
towards him. Startled, he loses his footing, and stumbles to
the ground. His foot is tangled in some roots. He starts
yanking with all his might, glancing up to see:
The wolves are galloping toward him. Their sharp teeth glint
in the moonlight. We see the boy from the wolves’ point of
view.
The boy’s eyes flash with terror as we close in on him.
There’s nothing he can do. In the distance someone is calling
a name...”Ben...Ben...Ben...”
We hear the boy’s SCREAM.

INT. ROBBY’S BEDROOM - 1977 - NIGHT

BEN - the boy in the dream, a thoughtful, sullen kid - bolts
up in bed. His face is covered in sweat. From across the room
we hear his cousin ROBBY.
Ben!!

ROBBY

BEN
(panting, still lost in
the dream)
What?
Ben, tangled in the sheets of a fold-up cot, is wearing the
same T-shirt and pajama bottoms he was wearing in the dream.
Robby, 14-years-old, with the beginning of a mustache,
switches on his lamp, knocking two hunting magazines to the
floor. He is sweating too and whips the blanket off him.
ROBBY
What? What’s the matter? Huh? Can’t
you hear me? Are you deaf?
BEN
Stop it, Robby.
There is a knock from the other side of the wall.
AUNT JENNY (O.S.)
Go to sleep, boys!
ROBBY
(returning the call)
Sorry, mom.
BEN
Sorry, Aunt Jenny!
ROBBY
(without taking his eyes
off of Ben)
Shut. Up.
Robby makes a gun with his fingers and shoots it toward Ben,
then switches off his lamp and turns over in his bed.
We can hear the crickets for the first time.
TITLE CARD: GUNFLINT, MINNESOTA, 1977
Ben eyes Robby’s side of the room, his collection of guns and
knives, fishing rods and hunting trophies.

He turns over to face the wall. A small slip of blue paper is
tacked there. In the moonlight it reads:
We are all in the gutter, but some
of us are looking at the stars.
He glides his fingers across the words before reaching under
his pillow to pull out a leather wallet. It has stitching
around the edges and the silhouette of a wolf stamped onto
the front.
Ben covers the wolf with his hand, opens the wallet and pulls
out a folded piece of paper. It’s a newspaper item that
reads:
February 18th, 1977, Local
Librarian Dies In Auto Accident
A distant tug of MUSIC stirs up a few fleeting images:

FLASHBACK: INT. CHURCH - 1977 - DAY

Black shoes. Old people taking their seats in the pews for
the funeral. A tear skidding down a woman’s cheek. A
photograph of the woman who died, classmates sitting several
rows back with their parents.

FLASHBACK: EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - 1977 - DAY

4

An egret is being drawn in ballpoint pen in a spiral
notebook. It sits perched on a branch behind which a
crosshatch predator looms, a wolf or hound.
We see Ben hunched over his notebook, trying to get it just
right. Three boys Ben’s age stare at him.
Ben looks away from them as a yellow Gunflint bus pulls up.

Ben shakes himself out of the memory and looks again at the
newspaper clipping.
There’s a photograph of a pretty young woman with a ponytail,
the same woman in the photograph at the funeral in the
flashback.
Words and phrases from the article jump out at Ben: Elaine
Wilson... ice... lost control... darkness... survived by her
son, Benjamin...

There’s a small knock on Ben’s bedroom door. Ben, in bed,
looks up from a book on constellations. His mom, the woman
from the photographs, sticks her head in the room. She has a
her hair in a ponytail and is wearing her favorite robe.
ELAINE
Hey, guess what? We forgot a
present.
She holds up a small wrapped gift. Ben keeps reading.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
What’s that?
BEN
Constellations.
Catch.

ELAINE

She tosses Ben the gift, but it bounces off the bed and falls
to the floor. He sighs and goes to pick it up. A telescope
with a bow on it is set up beside him, near his window.
His mom approaches, picking up some cellophane, a small rock,
and a model of a whale, which she places atop his shelf.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
You really do live in a museum.
Ben’s shelf is in fact his own natural history museum: rocks
and pebbles and shells, bones and fossils, all organized into
groups, with hand-written explanatory cards. She turns back
to Ben, who is opening his last present.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
Why do you always look so sad,
Benjamin Wilson?
Ben ignores the remark, a practice he has recently and
selectively adopted. She takes a glance through the new
telescope as he opens up a small box.
It’s the wolf wallet, brand new.
BEN
Neat. Like the one we saw, on the
trail. Thanks, mom.
Elaine looks up from the telescope and smiles.

ELAINE
Sure, handsome.
So...
Yes?

BEN
ELAINE

BEN
Was my dad an astronomer?
Elaine’s expression immediately changes, as if a curtain has
come down. Ben senses this but keeps talking, aware he’s on a
dangerous cliff.
BEN (CONT’D)
Maybe that’s why I like outer space
so much. It makes sense...
His mom, with a forced smile, walks silently over and sits on
the edge of his bed.
ELAINE
Happy birthday, Mister twelve-year
old.
She gently kisses his forehead.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
Don’t stay up too long.
She exits the room, leaving Ben awake in bed, frustrated.

INT. LANDING/ELAINE’S BEDROOM - 1977 - NIGHT

7

Ben approaches his mom’s bedroom from the upstairs landing,
passing a bookshelf stuffed with old toys and science
projects.
Through her partly opened door he sees her smoking a
cigarette while standing beside an old portable record
player. She pulls her pony tail tighter, and walks to an
alcove where she has a desk. She sits. David Bowie’s “Space
Oddity” has begun to play.
Ben settles at the bedroom door as his mother closes her eyes
for a moment, listening to the music.

Mom?

BEN

Elaine doesn’t hear him.

Mom?

BEN (CONT’D)

Elaine jumps.
ELAINE
Jesus - God, you scared me. What
are you doing out of bed?
BEN
(taking a deep breath)
Why won’t you ever talk about him?
Other kids know their dads...
ELAINE
Not now, Ben. Go back to bed.
BEN
It’s what I wished for, you know,
when I blew out the candles.
ELAINE
Another time, okay? When it’s the
right time.
BEN
It’s never the right time.
Ben turns to his mother’s mirror, which is covered in
postcards of famous works of art, clippings, and some of his
childhood artwork.
Stuck on top with a piece of tape is the small blue piece of
paper with the words: We are all in the gutter, but some of
us are looking at the stars.
BEN (CONT’D)
What does this mean?
What Ben?

ELAINE

BEN
This quote - “We are all in the
gutter but some of us are looking
at the stars.” You said it the
night we saw the shooting stars,
and now it’s on your wall. What

INT. ROBBY’S ROOM - 1977 - NIGHT

Ben, back in the cot of his cousin’s room, is looking at the
quote on the wall, gently tracing its edges.
We FOLLOW each word as he whispers them to himself:
BEN
We are all in the gutter, but some
of us are looking at the stars...
The last word: “stars” fills his vision and ours, as a soft
swirl of MUSIC RISES...

The featured actress is LILLIAN MAYHEW, a silent screen star
with large eyes, a tiny mouth and long hair.
A girl’s hand caresses the page.
Then - RIP!
We see ROSE, a twelve-year-old girl, tear the page out of the
magazine. Long blonde hair, a simple light dress. Intense,
determined. Sad.
The SHOPKEEPER, hearing the noise, looks up, spots Rose and
starts yelling (though we do not hear any sounds).
A mother and daughter shopping nearby turn to look at the
commotion.
Rose, with the torn page in her hand, runs past the mother
and daughter, out of the store. The mother pulls her daughter
closer, as if out of danger.
The shopkeeper yells after Rose as she runs off down the
street. What a strange little girl...
11

EXT. HOBOKEN RIVER BANK - 1927 - DAY

11

Rose is now hurrying to a small clearing at the rocky edge of
the Hudson river.
She rushes to retrieve paper and pencil from her bag, with
the urgent need to express herself, even in her solitude.
With a shaking hand she writes across the paper: HELP ME!
TITLE CARD: HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, 1927
She then begins to fold up the piece of paper.
She tucks and folds the paper until she’s made...a little
boat.
She sets the boat onto the surface of the river.
She watches it as it floats precariously off towards
Manhattan - and the Fates.

Ben lies awake in bed, listening to the sound of the boats.
He sees something out the window.
Ben wiggles out of bed and grabs a red flashlight from his
cousin Robby’s shelf.
14

EXT. MINNESOTA WOODS - 1977 - NIGHT

14

Ben walks out of his aunt’s house along a small path leading
to the house next door. The house looks very much like his
aunt’s house, though it seems to have been abandoned. But
what’s drawn Ben is the strange, inexplicable fact that a
light has been turned on from inside the second floor, the
only interior light burning at this hour.
As we will soon learn, this is the house Ben and his mother
lived in, that Ben grew up in, until his mother died suddenly
and nothing in his life would ever be the same.
Ben walks silently past the knocking boats on his way toward
the lit windows of his old house. On the way he also passes a
small cabin that appears to have been shuttered for some
time.
Leaves crunch underfoot as Ben nears his old house,
approaching from the rear. He stops a moment when he sees the
back door is open. He thinks he hears something buzzing from
within. A voice?
He continues approaching, quietly.
15

EXT./INT. BEN’S HOUSE - 1977 - NIGHT

15

He realizes how loudly he’s breathing and stops for a moment,
suddenly understanding: it’s a record playing inside - the
song “Space Oddity.”
He switches on his flashlight and continues slowly into the
house. It all feels very spooky, like some sort of frozen
memory.
Most of the furniture is stacked or covered, standing beside
piles of sealed-up boxes and kitchenware still stacked on
counters, as if someone had begun to pack up the house but
never got around to finishing it.
Ben walks up the stairs.

INT. BEN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - 1977 - NIGHT

16

Ben’s heart is pounding as he slowly walks down the hallway,
past his old room, towards the source of the light, and the
music: his mother’s door.
It’s open slightly. He’s about to give it a shove when A shadow moves across the floor.
He stops.
He smells something, the smoke from her cigarettes...
Through the crack in the doorway he sees something
unbelievable...a blonde woman with a ponytail wearing his
mother’s favorite robe.
Ben’s hand is trembling.
BEN
(terrified)
Mom? Are you...
He pushes open the door.

INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 1927 - DAY

17

Rose is clearing the surface of her cluttered desk with one
swipe. She is carefully loading a brush full of rubber cement
onto the back of her clipping, coating the edges. She is
carefully placing it in a large bound scrapbook and pressing
down the corners. We can make out part of what it says as she
blows on it to dry:
Will our brightest star turn out to be a permanent fixture in
the heavens, or will she be a comet, who burns brightly for a
brief moment and then vanishes?
She returns a toppled post-card from its place on her window
sill. The card reads: Feb., 1927 - Happy Birthday, Rose, Love
Walter and is addressed to: Miss Rose Kincaid, 168 River
Street, Hoboken NJ.
Mostly dry, Rose begins to flip back through the pages. We
see the articles and ephemera Rose has collected, the dates
moving backwards through time as she flips from back to
front:
Is Lillian’s Career Over?

There’s a small advertisement for a movie:

Rose closes the scrapbook and gazes out her window a moment
in thought.
Out the window, through a break in the trees, is a piece of
the Manhattan skyline that Rose has stared at every day of
her life.
As we DRIFT back into Rose’s room, past her lace curtains and
across her shelves of books, we find that she too has a tiny
world on display on the shelves of her room, but hers is a
hand-made skyline. Countless buildings she has made from
newsprint and magazine and paper line her shelves as if the
city she longs for across the water has tumbled into her
room.

Light spills onto Ben’s darkened face as he stares into his

reaches up to pull her pony tail tighter.
Ben drops his flashlight and gasps.
His mom turns.
But it’s not his mom! It’s his cousin JANET, a teenage girl,
with big glasses.

She looks down at her hand, as if noticing the cigarette for
the first time, and quickly stubs it out.

Janet slips off the robe she’d put on (the same one his

wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top.
Ben watches as she dutifully puts the record back in its
sleeve, adjusting her glasses and pulling out her ponytail.

He opens up a drawer and examines its contents, and then the
next. At first it’s embarrassing, seeing his mother’s private
intimate things, but soon he finds himself opening every one
of her drawers as if unable to stop himself.
In one, he finds an old coffee tin and lifts the plastic lid
off of it. Inside he finds a wad of cash, a sort of rainy day
fund his mother must have kept hidden. He lifts out the wad
to see if there’s anything else in the tin before replacing
it with the cash and lid back inside the drawer, and resuming
his meander.
Then, in the bottom drawer, Ben spots something truly
strange. Something wrapped in a brown paper bag that’s been
wrapped up for a very long time. Just as Ben takes hold of it
in his hand A boom of thunder crashes as Ben carefully unfolds the brown
paper bag and reaches inside.
It’s a very old, blue book. On the back cover he reads:
Published by The American Museum of Natural History, New
York, New York

He spots the red flashlight and switches it on.
He moves the beam around the room, then settles back into the

WE FLOAT down the hallway, into Ben’s old room, to his old

book were describing him.
As his V.O. continues we survey his rows of shells and
strangely shaped stones and teeth and tiny animal skulls, the
fossils, pinecones, leaves from local trees, all arranged
with handwritten cards annotating every find...
BEN (V.O., READING)
“But how did the very first
curators store their collections?
They were kept in pieces of
furniture called Cabinets of
Wonder. Eventually, some
collections grew beyond the
confines of a single cabinet and
took over entire rooms. See figure

Ben, still reading on his mother’s bed, turns the page to:
Figure 9.
Lit by the red flashlight, the double-page spread features an
ancient engraving of a CABINET OF WONDERS.
BEN
(Whispers)
Oh...my god.
We see what he sees...a cabinet, perhaps, but of such extreme
unfoldability it appears to consume an entire room, leaving
little more than the edge of its checkerboard floor. The
endless drawers and shelves, filled with strange and various
objects - stuffed reptiles, decapitated heads, dried fish,
skeleton insects, to name but a few - all unfold from an
intricately carved central cabinet, crowned with a crest of
sea shells and coral. A giraffe’s head peeks up from one edge
of the cabinet.
Ben’s finger moves across the drawing, as if trying to touch
everything in it. Then he turns the page.

TITLE CARD: “Where can we find shelter from the storm?”
ON SCREEN: The Young Mother cradles a Baby in her arms.
In a murky LONG SHOT, the Young Mother runs out from under
the sheltering trees into a wild forest, wracked by savage
winds. Her hair whips and twists in the gale.
In CLOSE UP, the Young Mother looks around desperately for
protection.
She spots something: a cabin in the distance (shot in
miniature...antique special effects).
Her face brightens with hope and she begins to run towards
the cabin.
But the organ MUSIC blares as the wind picks up. And the
miniature cabin trembles in the terrible gust, which pulls
off its roof and sweeps it away. Soon the rest of the house
shakes, buckles and falls down, pulled by tiny threads.
The Young Mother screams and collapses in fright, covering
her Baby for protection, raising a single hand towards god.
In the audience, Rose watches the silent film intensely.

A powder-blue phone is sitting on the night stand, within

He dials the number printed on the bookmark. The storm grows.
Each number rolls slowly around the rotary dial - 8...7...6 with each one Ben’s heart beats faster - 8...8...9...0 ... He

INT. BEN’S HOUSE - MOTHER’S ROOM - 1977 - NIGHT

Ben’s eyes flutter open.
SILENCE.
He finds himself lying on the floor of his mom’s room.
Peaceful in the silence. The storm must have passed.
But something’s wrong.
The blue receiver is lying on the floor out of reach, black
and smoldering.
The old book he found, soft-cover blue, lies open behind him,
face down on the ground.
With a strange slowness Ben turns his head towards the
window. He sees rain still falling, shaking the trees, and
lightning still flashing from the sky... yet there is still
no sound. No sound at all.

SILENCE.
Ben’s face. His eyes wide open. He sits up suddenly.
AUNT JENNY is sitting on the bed, dressed in her work uniform
(her name, “Jenny,” stitched into her brown blouse). She
looks exhausted and scared, as Janet looks on beside her.
Robby sits sulking in the corner. Aunt Jenny strokes Ben’s
hair and speaks to him, but we don’t hear any sound.
Ben looks back, and tries to reply, but the sound of his
voice has been replaced by a deeply buried echo.
BEN
Where am I? What happened?
It sounds more like the memory of a voice than anything
anyone could actually hear.
BEN (CONT'D)
(Mouthing the words...)
What’s wrong? Hello? Hello?
Aunt Jenny puts a finger to her mouth, mouthing: “Shhh,”
indicating that she can hear him.
The nurse hands Jenny a clipboard with a piece of paper, and
a pen. Aunt Jenny writes something down. She shows what she’s
written to Ben:
It’s OK. You had an accident.
Ben doesn’t understand.
Jenny crosses out what she wrote. She turns the pad around so
Ben can see and draws a simple house - a box with a triangle
on top. She adds a curly telephone line and a stick figure
holding the line to his ear.
She draws a storm cloud over the house, and a jagged
lightning bolt coming out of the cloud, hitting the house.
Then she traces a line from the lightning bolt, through the
house, through the telephone wire, into the stick figure’s
head.
Ben’s watches with wide, stricken eyes.
BEN (CONT’D)
(mouthing the words)
I don’t remember.

He grabs the pen and paper and writes: I can’t talk!
Aunt Jenny writes back: Yes you can. You just can’t hear
yourself.
Then she underlines the word: yourself
Ben, overwhelmed by everything, looks around helplessly as he
rests his head on the pillow. Jenny kisses his temple to try
to comfort him.

The storm has ended. Rose hurries in the front door of the

INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - 1927 - NIGHT

She shuts the door behind her and turns with a start when MUSIC striking - someone stamps their foot on the floor. It’s
her father, DOCTOR KINCAID, a large man in an expensive suit
who has been waiting for her in the corner of her room. He is
glaring.
He stands, wagging his finger and scolding her in rage (in
words we do not hear but can certainly imagine):
DOCTOR KINCAID
Look at you! Just LOOK at you! Do
you have any idea what trouble and
worry you inflict on this home? Do
you?! How in God’s name do you
continue to abuse the liberty I
extend you - and throw it in my
face? Why I have half a mind to...
He remembers the note he wrote, which he thrusts out for her
(”Here - read!”):
You are in serious trouble, young lady! Your teacher comes
tomorrow. Study his book!
He shoves a large black book into Rose’s hands and storms out
of his daughter’s room, slamming the door behind him.
Rose looks down at the large black book, reading its full
title for the first time:

Rose crumples onto her bed, as if from its sheer weight. She
yanks open the book across her lap.
Its Introduction immediately proclaims:
A Deaf Child Must Learn To Speak!
Rose stares at the words. She turns the page again. Chapter
One: The Elements Classified, starting with: Mouth Cavity,
this above a lurid illustration of a splayed-open mouth, that
looks as if it were screaming. The anatomical parts are all
clinically labeled in white darts.
RIP!
Rose tears the lurid page from the big black book like she
tore out the page from the movie magazine in the drug store:
fast. She slams the book shut and looks off into space.
Upset, she cracks open her bedroom door and looks down below.

She sets it down on a central table in front of where Doctor

It’s morning, and MUSIC marks the arrival of new paper

various screaming-talking-mouth pictures from the big black

Asleep at her desk amidst the scraps and scissors, Rose’s

she blinks herself awake.

Rose sits alone with her father at the breakfast table,
trying to avoid his gaze.
Her father glares at her suspiciously between bites of eggs

Rose catches one of his steely looks and turns away, staring
into her breakfast plate. He waves his hand in front of her
and points to the salt. She passes it. His eyes linger,
staring.
He salts his eggs and straightens the paper with a mighty
shake. He turns the page of his newspaper.
An article has been cut out of the center of the last page
and Doctor Kincaid glares through the telltale hole at the
guilty face of his daughter.
He lowers the paper and starts yelling (though we don’t hear
him), unleashing far more than the minor infraction deserves.

Rose takes her postcard from her window-sill, the one that

She reads it once more before resting it on top of her

Rose finds a place amidst the crowds on the observation deck

hand inside her bag and carefully fishes out the newspaper
clipping.
As she unfolds it a gust of wind seizes the clipping from her
hand and it goes sailing. Rose looks around anxiously for the
clipping and sees it settle among the small forest of legs.
But when she goes to retrieve it the wind beats her to it and
it goes flying again. From one passenger’s leg to another she
follows the sailing culprit, squeezing past bodies as she
goes.
Finally, near the railing, she seizes hold of it, clutching
it tightly in her hands and cupping it upright to read again:

NEAR SILENCE. Ben has already been on the bus for a long
time. He looks around the bus. There is a green army satchel
wedged between his legs.
There are several conversations around him, though he can’t
hear them, nor can we.
A large BLACK WOMAN is sitting two rows in front of him. He
looks up at her, and it’s as if he’s aware of the echo of her
voice in the far far distance.
WOMAN ON BUS
(talking to someone across
the aisle from her.)
... Not to me he doesn’t, no sir Can you believe that? I don’t know
what he’s thinking, that boy... And
I’m his mother...
He stares at her mouth as she continues to talk.
The bus shakes and rattles in silence. Ben sneaks his wallet
out of his satchel. He peeks inside, revealing a thick wad of
bills, obviously taken from his mother’s rainy day fund.
Ben looks out the dirty window but can’t see anything. He
tries to peer through the grime to where he’s headed.

Inside, the filthy orange tiles and brown bricks do little to

their bags, huddled on benches or against walls, some beneath
sheets of cardboard. He sees a woman rooting through a
garbage can.
A clock on the wall reads 3:46 AM.
SILENCE. Ben tries to figure out which way to head. He
wanders upstairs to a dank waiting lounge and looks around
for a spot he can settle into.
He finds a dark corner, near a cigarette machine, and sinks
down onto a plastic seat, clutching his bag like armor.
As he tries to close his eyes we DRIFT OFF slowly, across the
sad and lonely lounge, where other clumps of lonely people
have settled in for the night.

Smart stores flickering by, smart women with short bobs and
tight cloches. And a stream of businessmen in flat straw-hats
and fedoras.
Rose continues on, caught between the seamless flow and the
constant jostle, the snaking traffic and corner venders,
dwarfed and elevated by everything she sees.
She looks up - and what a sight! Buildings jutting into the
sky, grande facades and streamline splendor. Chrome and
steel, brick and stone. Hard sharp shadows.
In the distance, the jutting spines of new construction,
shooting lines of steel into the sky.
Dizzy with the sights Rose walks headlong towards a horse and
carriage making a sudden turn onto a cross-street.
Startled, Rose falls backwards into a MALE PEDESTRIAN, and
hits the ground. The Pedestrian glances back with a flash of
annoyance as he marches on.
Rose watches as the crowd resumes its busy pace, marching
past her, oblivious.
Rose, still on the ground, looks up to see a young WORKMAN in
a cap, offering her his hand. She accepts his help and he
gets her to her feet again.
WORKMAN
Give me your hand, it’s all right.
There you go.
As he chats with her, soundlessly, she struggles to retrieve
her newspaper clipping.
WORKMAN (CONT’D)
First time in the city? Must be
from the look on your face. Got to
be careful out here. If it’s not
the horse and carriages that get
you it’ll be the cabs that knock
you down... What’s that there?
She opens up the clipping and holds it out to him,
questioningly. The Workman looks back at her, not
understanding her lack of response. She points to the address
of the Promenade Theater, framed at the bottom of the article
until he nods, finally, smiling, and pointing up and over

the doors of Port Authority. He pushes through the doors into
the swarming, teaming fray. What does he see?
People of every shape and size and color, hurtling past him,
the swirling steaming, dirty city, a riot of bright colors
and patterns. New York is in the middle of a heat wave and
everyone sweats and burns. Ben is thrilled, overwhelmed,
frightened, but knows he has a mission...
He looks up at the nearest street sign which reads: 42nd
Street. He steps beside a security booth, reaches into his
pocket and takes out his wolf wallet. He carefully retrieves
the old bookmark, turns it over to inspect the address of the
bookstore it came from: Kincaid’s Books, West 73rd Street
Ben turns to look back behind him. A block away: 41st street.
Satisfied, he turns back around, puts the bookmark and wallet
away, and sets off on his journey.
He forges past the glaring teeth of taxis and dirty buses,
joining the other pedestrians crossing the street. Suddenly
he is among their shiny stringy bodies, the clashing colors
of their skimpy clothes.
At the corner, Jazz-funk MUSIC blares from a passing car. A
newsstand is stuffed with daily papers shouting out bold-face

And the faces of people sitting on stoops or standing on

Suddenly - he is bumped hard by someone passing by - and
SOUND rips in - screaming sirens, barking dogs.
Ben spots a hot dog vendor at the corner. He is starving.
He takes out his wallet and rifles for a single dollar. A
HAND comes out of the crowd and snatches it.
Ben looks up in a panic, and spots the THIEF running away.
BEN
Hey! Stop! Give that back!
Ben tears off after him. He sees the thief tossing something
behind him before vanishing around a corner.
Ben squeezes past an elderly couple and spots something up
ahead, dropped in the gutter.
It’s his wallet.
Ben snatches it up and hovers near a doorway. His money is
gone but he’s relieved to see that both the article about his
mother and the quote about the stars have survived.
Dejected, starving, and without any money, Ben puts the
wallet back into his pocket. He forges ahead into the silent

Rose makes her way through a narrow corridor. Stepping out,
she suddenly finds herself at the foot of the stage where a
full dress rehearsal is in progress. Lights beam down from
the dusty rafters setting the stage aglow. The set is a
1920’s version of a garden in an 18th century French estate.
Rose suddenly stops dead in her tracks.
There, onstage, is LILLIAN MAYHEW herself. She is dressed in
a 18th century costume with an adorned white powder wig,
playing the young French noblewoman, ADELIS.
Onstage with her is an actor playing her young handsome
suitor, VALENTIN, and a man playing the elderly tutor,
MONSIEUR RAQUEU. Two additional actors stand on either side
of Raqueu, dressed as Sentries.
At Adelis’s command, the two Sentries have just let go of
Raqueu, who brushes off his clothing, indignantly. Lillian
then addresses him, moving from one beam of light to the
next. Despite her heavy theatrical make-up and oversized
gestures, Lillian Mayhew is every bit as beautiful in the
flesh as she is in her photographs.
[The following dialogue from the play and what follows will
not be ‘heard’ but will be performed by the actors]:

LILLIAN [AS ADELIS]
Dear Raqueu, my time with you has

heart. You remember her death and
you’ve watched as my father grew
bitter, shutting me away on these
grounds, alone. But you know not
that it was dreams of my mother
that led me to Valentin and his
poet’s heart. And it is my mother’s
advice that I now take.
Rose, who suddenly feels a tear come to her eye, accidentally
knocks her embroidered bag into a ladder. A large light-bulb
falls to the floor, shattering.
Everyone turns, startled, including Lillian Mayhew. The
DIRECTOR, seated in the orchestra, hollers

understand)

menacing. Rose takes out a pad of paper and writes something
down in reply. With great pleading eyes, she holds it up to
Lillian:

Lillian can’t take any more.

She drops the pad and in front of her daughter, pats her
roughly on the head and hurriedly replaces her wig. Then she
heads to the door, gathers her wits and leaves, closing the
door behind her.
Rose waits a moment, then goes to the door. Locked. She bangs

Remnants of a sign hang from a nail, which reads:

Ben presses his eye against a hole in the plywood. He can see
inside the abandoned store, but something darts by near his
feet.
A rat jumps out of a crack in the concrete, and Ben jumps
backwards in disgust. He stumbles into someone passing on the
street, and spins around on his heels, startled.
SOUND. Ben has bumped into a BOY, about his age, with long
curly black hair and olive skin. He is wearing a striped
shirt, a green backpack on one shoulder, and a POW bracelet
on his wrist. A Polaroid camera hangs around his neck.
BOY
Ow! Watch it!
The boy takes a harder look at Ben and realizes he’s just a
kid, a kid with a very lost expression on his face.
BOY (CONT’D)
Oh - (disconcerted)... Sorry...
The boy looks from Ben to the old storefront.

Ben sees the boy is speaking to him but he can’t read his
lips. The boy points down the block as if giving directions.
BOY (CONT’D)
If you’re looking for the
bookstore, it moved around the
corner, a few blocks down... On

BOY’S FATHER
Vamos Jamie, llego tarde.
Ben sees that the boy’s FATHER is waiting impatiently ahead,
tapping his wristwatch. The man has a black mustache and
glasses.
BOY
(joining his father)
I’m just telling him...
The boy and the father hurry off down the street. He looks
back towards Ben briefly before disappearing into the crowd.
Hey!

Ben catches the boy’s eye, and for some reason decides to
follow.

MUSIC continues as we see someone spotting Rose from across
the street. An attractive young woman with a bob haircut, we
realize it’s Doctor Kincaid’s Maid, PEARL, on her day off.
Shocked, Pearl recognizes Rose, alone and out of place on the
streets of New York.
Rose glances up from the storefront as a door opens and the
stage manager, from inside the theater, steps out for some
air. She decides she better start moving, in case he spots
her on the loose, so she gathers her belongings and continues
on her way.
Pearl, seeing Rose go, starts to follow, when TWO POLICEMEN,
on the beat, OFFICER ENGEL AND OFFICER MURTHA emerge from
around the corner, walking directly into her path.
PEARL
Officers! Wait! There’s a girl,
just turned the corner. I know her she can’t hear a thing. She’s

So?

Ben turns a corner, thinking he’s lost them. Then, half-way
up a huge concrete staircase, he spots the two of them. They
are about to enter a building on Central Park West that looks
like some kind of castle.
Ben sees a statue of a figure on horseback in the middle of
the staircase. There are giant columns across the facade, and
banners fluttering in the wind. People sit on the stairs. A
mime entertains the crowd.
The boy turns back, just before entering the building, and
catches sight of Ben. He gives Ben a smile, then vanishes
through the revolving door.
Ben wonders if the boy wants him to follow.
He sees a sign at the top of the steps with the name of the
building on it:

MUSIC. We see a large brick building, with two staircases

But in fact, it’s a photograph we are looking at, on the
postcard Rose is holding.
Printed on the white border at the bottom of the postcard we
can now see: The American Museum of Natural History, 1927.
Rose moves the postcard away to reveal the actual museum
behind it, in the exact same position as it had been in the
photo.
Rose turns the postcard over. It’s the one we’ve seen before
(though we’d never seen the front image), the one with the
words: Happy Birthday, Rose, Love your brother Walter...
Rose, with her embroidered bag at her feet, watches people
heading into the museum. She joins them.

The boy’s father shows his ID to a SECURITY GUARD and
vanishes down a hallway.
The boy is on his own now. He turns and sees Ben, in the
distance, coming through the revolving doors. He smiles to
himself. He sees Ben look around the huge lobby of the
museum, at the murals covering the walls and the quotes from
Theodore Roosevelt.
The boy watches as Ben looks toward the admissions line, and
takes out his wallet. He looks inside it, glumly.
He watches as Ben closes his wallet and absently returns it
to his pocket - but misses it. The wallet falls to the floor
with a thud - which, we understand, Ben doesn’t hear. Instead
he looks around the lobby without catching sight of the boy,
and continues on.
The boy scurries over and snatches up the wallet, then
hurries after Ben.
He taps Ben on the shoulder, who turns to see a flash of
stripes and green.
SILENCE. The boy waves the wallet with a devilish grin, then
runs off playfully.
Ben automatically checks his pocket, realizes it’s not there,
and spins around, searching for the boy.
BEN
Hey that’s mine!
He spots the boy, crouched down beneath a stanchion at the
far right end of the room. He’s smiling at Ben, waving Ben’s
wallet. He beckons him to follow.
Ben runs over, but when he gets there, the boy is gone. Ben
looks around, makes sure the guard isn’t watching, and sneaks
under the stanchion.

Ben runs through a large entry-way where he finds himself
facing down a herd of elephants. It’s the Hall of African
Mammals. The dioramas lining the walls on either side of the
room glow like windows into other worlds, and herds of school
children run like mad from animal to animal.
He glances around: Where did the boy go? He spots him through

The other boys laugh and run off. Rose looks up and sees the
penny sitting on the top of the meteorite reflected in a
mirror on the ceiling.
Rose sits down next to the meteorite, taking out a paper and
pencil to make a quick sketch.
Opposite her, THREE SCHOOLGIRLS. One girl is rummaging
through her purse looking for coins.
GIRL 1
Of course it’ll come true.
GIRL 2
That’s fountains, not meteorites!
GIRL 1
It said meteorites were shooting

Fine! Here it is! Are you going to

No! That’s not what I’m wishing at

GIRL 2
Wishes don’t come true on

GIRL 1
Yes they do!
Rose watches them from a sad reserve, their giggling and
fooling with each other. She looks down at the first few
lines of her sketch and writes:
Where do I belong?
Then she begins folding the piece of paper into a boat.
Rose steps up on the platform, and she places the paper boat
atop the meteorite, as if setting it assail on a vast black
sea.
Rose looks at it reflected in the mirror on the ceiling.

“This typical December winter scene is placed at the margin

the Museum SECURITY CHIEF, a man in his 60’s, who spots
Rose’s Guard from across the room. The Security Chief

She skulks along through the shadows, past display cabinets

plastic tarps cover tall dusty windows overlooking a

The room appears to be about half as big as it once was due
to all the masses of items stored within - half of them old

He next touches all his fingers to his thumb except for his
index finger, which he points straight up.
Jamie motions for Ben to repeat what he’s doing. When Ben has
trouble getting the shape right, Jamie adjusts Ben’s hand,
bending a finger or tightening a fist.

There are also lots of pictures of visitors, families, close
ups of shoes and coats and children, all unaware they are

up and together they unfold the rug and lay it out flat on
the floor. A tired Ben collapses. Jamie reaches down and
wraps the bottom of the rug over him to use as a blanket.
They laugh as Jamie turns off the light and heads towards the
door.
JAMIE

Thanks, Jamie.
Ben looks around the room and smiles before closing his eyes

MUSIC. Rose spots the cops and the guard returning, and she
makes her retreat down the hall toward a gathering crowd of
museum-goers.
104

INT. AMNH - CABINETS OF WONDER - MOMENTS LATER - 1927

104

Up ahead a crowd stands on line at the entrance to a newlyopened exhibition. Rose sneaks unseen towards the front of
the line.
Rose glances back, and sees the cops, the guard and the
Security Chief consulting near the stairwell. The Chief
points them in the direction of the exhibition ahead.
She approaches the entry to the exhibition. The large sign
stationed by the entrance reads:
Cabinets of Wonder. How Museums Began
She weaves her way into the exhibition, joining the mingling
spectators. What she discovers inside is something she’s
never seen before.
The exhibition is a recreation of an old Cabinet of Wonders,
right down to the fossils, strange fish, and thousand other
magnificent and fascinating objects. We recognize it
immediately from Figure 9, the engraving in Ben’s
book...except it’s real.
Rose walks towards the free-standing cabinet in the center of
the room, the one with a crown at the top made of coral and
seashells. A taxidermied giraffe’s head seems to peek up from
one edge
Rose looks back and sees the cops arriving at the exhibition.
She quickly starts looking around for a place to hide as MISS
CONRAD, a Saleswoman, informs a YOUNG MAN with glasses
working near her at the souvenir stand, about the police who
are after a girl in the museum.

Slipping behind the central display, Rose finds a hollow of
space behind a rear cabinet and slides down to the floor. She
pulls her knees up to her chin, propping her bag next to her.
WE HEAR:

his sleep.
JAMIE
Wake up! Come on!
No.

BEN

JAMIE
I told my father I was staying over

Jamie beckons for Ben to follow him into a dark hallway. Ben,
groggily follows.

The boys go through a maze of hallways, smaller now and more
cluttered with old things in storage.
They come to a sign that says Workshop and inside they
explore the place where all the exhibitions are made.

WONDERSTRUCK

61.

There are walls of metal tools and jars of mysterious liquids
and sinks and chairs. Cabinets with molds and display stands
line the walls. Animal forms hang from the ceiling.
Jamie leads Ben through a series of storage rooms and work
rooms, and the boys run their hands across shelf after shelf
of old dinosaur bones and rows of little birds in boxes and
seashells, bugs, ancient clothing, spear heads, turquoise
jewelry, ivory buttons and a thousand other fascinating
things. Ben breathes deeply. He’s thrilled.
Wow.

BEN

Ben plays with some of the objects.
JAMIE
Hey, look. See? The light goes
through.
Jamie shines the flashlight through a glass eye as Ben places
another pair of glass eyes over his own eyes like a monster.
Jamie laughs. The boys continue through the room, touching
everything from clay masks to plaster wings as they pass.
They stop at a butterfly mounted on a branch.
Wow.

JAMIE (CONT’D)

Jamie blows a breath of air against the butterfly’s wings.
The wings flutter.
Ben looks around and touches a wax sculpture of a bird and a
runs his fingers through the fur of a taxidermied mountain
goat up above.
BEN
Hey. Check this out.
Jamie emerges and approaches Ben with his flashlight.
JAMIE
Ben! Come on. Let’s go!

Jamie leads Ben to another hallway lined on both sides as far
as they could see with black filing cabinets, five drawers
high.

Ben stops and opens one of the filing cabinets. It’s stuffed
completely with papers and files and photos.
Ben opens a drawer at random, reaches into a file, and pulls
out a large black and white photo of the museum in the
1920’s. It’s the entrance that we’ve seen Rose go into.
BEN
Jamie. What is all this stuff?
JAMIE
(putting his finger to his
lips)
Shh. Secrets!
Ben puts the photo back.
He looks down the endless hallway at all the filing cabinets.
An idea starts to form in his mind, but...
Come on!

Jamie leads Ben away from the cabinet at which he was
looking. The label: Hall of North American Mammals

MUSIC. The young man with glasses has Rose firmly in hand as
he speaks to Miss Conrad, the saleswoman from the souvenir
counter. Rose looks around, anxiously, before settling on the
pile of books in front of her, on display.
They are brand new copies of the catalogue book from the
exhibition titled: WONDERSTRUCK.
The saleswoman nods and takes the man’s place at the counter.
Then the young man shuffles Rose off to a nearby office.

The young man closes the door behind them.
Inside, along the narrow office wall, there are paintings and
photographs related to the museum, collections of
butterflies, pinned inside frames, and portraits of past
museum Presidents staring down at Rose.
The young Salesman sits Rose down and grabs a piece of paper
and pencil from a desk, leaning down to write.

He turns the page to show Rose what he has written. It reads:

SOUND. Jamie and Ben are hurrying back into the storage room,
switching on the lights and catching their breath.
Open it!
What?

JAMIE
BEN

The boys fall to the floor huddled over a green folder
they’ve taken. There’s a small plastic tab at the top of the
file and inside is a piece of paper that says: WOLF: Gunflint
Lake, Minnesota
JAMIE
Come on, the file! Open it up.
They flip through the pages and see photographs of birds,
animals and trees that Ben knows from home. Photographs of
the sky and clouds and stones and wide expanses of snow.
BEN
The wolves.
JAMIE
Whoa. That is so cool.
On the bottom of most of the photos it says “1965.”
BEN
(reading)
February, ‘65... That’s the year
before I was born.
Ben and Jamie uncover several drawings of wildlife, egrets,
etc. But mostly more wolves in every possible position. Ben
marvels at the way they run and sit and jump across the
pages. He and Jamie look at each other.
Whoa.

JAMIE

Ben picks up the sketch of the wolves.

JAMIE

Ben finds drawings of Gunflint Lake. Pictures of the lake and
trees.
He comes upon a drawing of his own house, which he stares at
in shock.
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Ben? What is it?
Ben doesn’t hear him. Jamie taps him on the shoulder and
repeats: “What?” Ben can see his lips.
BEN
It’s my house.
He and Jamie look at each other. Ben searches intensely
through the file.
Next come a small group of legal papers, contracts, letters,
receipts, charts and tickets.
A letter on museum stationary has the date November 27th,
1964 typed on it. Ben reads:
BEN (CONT’D)
Miss Elaine Wilson. That’s my mom.
We scroll down the letter as Ben reads it. Jamie looks over
Ben’s shoulder...
BEN (V.O.)
“Dear Miss Wilson... I will be
spending a few months in Gunflint

The title below his name reads: Exhibition Preparator, The

“Daniel. Lobel”
Ben is holding the letter from Daniel Lobel. His hands shake.
BEN (CONT’D)
This has to be my dad. Your
father...maybe he still remembers
him! You have to ask him in the
morning!
JAMIE
Yeah. I will.
Jamie, with great seriousness, lifts his camera. Ben holds
the file to the side of his face and Jamie takes another
picture of him, documenting the moment. The flash is bright
and seems to linger in the air.
Then he solemnly hands the camera to Ben who takes a picture
of Jamie.
Jamie shares his view of the note-pad with Ben and writes:
BEN
(reading as he writes)
“I’ve... never... shown...
anyone... the museum... before.”
Jamie, continues talking casually, as if Ben could
understand:
JAMIE
But I like it here. I don’t have a
room at my dad’s place.
(suddenly remembering
something)
Oh - Hold on! I think you’ll like
this one.
Jamie gets up and lifts a cardboard hood off a plastic
battery-operated record player.
He chooses a record from a nearby stack and puts it on the
turntable.
He lowers the arm and smiles, then stops and smacks his head,
indicating he’d done something stupid.
Jamie points to his own ears.

JAMIE (CONT’D)
Oh. I forgot.
BEN
It’s okay. Keep it on. My mom had
one like that.
The bold tinny intro to The Sweet’s hit, “Fox On The Run,”
rings out. And Ben puts his hand on the black fabric
stretched across the speaker.
BEN (CONT’D)
I can feel the vibrations.
Jamie and Ben start bopping their heads to the music. They
look at each other and smile. Ben makes a shape with his
hand. He is going to spell something...

Ben struggles to remember the next correct shape, then makes

MUSIC shimmers as dazzling rows and arcs of lights flare and
fog through the window of the taxicab - a glorious idealized
vision of Times Square, sparkling and glowing, like an
exquisite miniature in an old movie.
Rose glances over at her brother Walter, who is very annoyed.
He glances back at her and rolls his eyes.
She’s happy though, and she looks back out at the lights of
the city.
118

INT. WALTER’S APARTMENT - 1927 - NIGHT

118

Walter leads Rose into his unlit apartment and flips on some
lamps, revealing a sparsely decorated, single bedroom
apartment - many books and little furniture: a student’s
apartment.
He sits down and pours himself a finger of brandy as Rose
remains standing by the door.
Finally Walter bursts, shaking his head in disbelief
mouthing:
WALTER
I can’t believe I had to hide you
from the cops!
Rose shakes her head, indicating: “what?”
Walter grabs a pad and pencil and writes: THE COPS!!
He and Rose laugh as he folds the pad and writes another
note: You know Mom - she’ll find you sooner or later.
Walter gets up and grabs a sleeping roll from the front
closet, indicating he’ll sleep on the roll and she can take
the bedroom. But she grabs the roll, to let him know that
she’ll sleep on it. They have a playful game of tug of war
until Walter tosses the roll aside and pretends that he and
his sister are in a boxing match, a game they’ve played
before. She deals him a mimed knock out punch and Walter
collapses in slow motion to the ground, much to her delight.

SOUND: Somewhere pigeons coo. Ben is asleep, wrapped in the
caveman blanket. Jamie is next to him, watching his friend
sleeping. There’s a wistfulness in his expression. He opens
the “WONDERSTRUCK” book for diversion and grabs the
flashlight. He turns a page, and stops, staring at something.
He has turned to figure 9, which intrigues him. Something
crosses Jamie’s mind, and he turns the flashlight onto the
room, sweeping the beam of light across its cluttered walls
and piles of stuff.
He looks down and sees the checker-board pattern on the floor
which is not unlike the floor in the drawing. Then...
Jamie, as if in a trance, gets up and notices a dangling rope
above the area where Ben is sleeping. He pulls on the rope. A
cloth comes tumbling down, unleashing a cloud of dust. Jamie
coughs. He shines his flashlight up high, illuminating a
large giraffe head wrapped in plastic that’s been revealed.
The giraffe’s black glass eye glimmers in the light.
Jamie stares in wonder. He runs over to jostle Ben, who
jumps.
JAMIE
Ben! Ben! Wake up. Come on!
He shines the flashlight in his eyes. Ben stands.
BEN
What - what is it? What - what is
it?
Jamie hands Ben the book and flashlight, open to Figure 9.
Look!

JAMIE

Jamie then shifts the flashlight onto the unearthed cabinet
standing before them. Ben stands, stunned, taking it all in.
BEN
It’s the same. It’s the same! We’re
in the Cabinet of Wonders! How did
this happen?
He looks at the book in his hand.
BEN (CONT’D)
Why did my father have this book?
Why was there a picture of my house
in that file?? What is going on?

Jamie does not respond. Ben can tell something is wrong.
WHAT?

BEN (CONT’D)

Jamie grabs the note pad and writes something down and shows
Ben. It says: Kincaids.
BEN (CONT’D)
What do you mean - the bookstore?
It’s gone...
Jamie drops his head and writes something more. He shows it
to Ben, who reads it back, aloud.
BEN (CONT’D)
“I tried to tell you it just moved.
I didn’t know you were deaf yet.”
Ben looks at Jamie, completely confused.
BEN (CONT’D)
But... what do you mean? You knew I
was trying to find my father.
That's why I went to Kincaid's in
the first place. Why would you wait
until now?
Jamie just drops his head, deeply ashamed.
JAMIE
(angry at himself,
confessing something he
knows Ben can’t hear)
Because I don’t have any friends.
What?

Jamie writes something in response. He shows it to Ben.
BEN (CONT’D)

“I wanted to show you” - what?
Jamie corrects a letter with his pen.

Ben starts gathering his things.
BEN
Yeah, well... If you wanted to be

JAMIE
I AM helping you! I’m helping you

On Walter’s bedside table sits a photo: a baby girl and an

the dining room of Rose’s house, back in Hoboken.
Walter turns off a lamp and approaches Rose below, in bed,
all tucked in. He playfully sticks out his tongue at his
sister.
WALTER

Good night.
Rose waves good night and Walter exits.
Rose looks around as she lays in bed. Through Walter’s
bedroom window she looks out at a slice of the shimmering
Manhattan skyline (it almost looks like something Rose
herself might have made from paper and cardboard).

Ben makes his way across the street, barely avoiding a
rushing car.

playing on a tape machine behind the counter.
OLD MAN (V.O.)
I’ll be right with you!
Of course Ben doesn’t hear this, or the radio, or the bell.
Hello?

BEN

Sunshine is pouring in through the front windows. Shelves
with books extend floor to ceiling. Ladders and boxes
everywhere. Posters on the ceiling. And that chocolatey smell
of old books.

WONDERSTRUCK

72.

In the center of the store a wood staircase rises to a second
level. Every step is lined with more books.
There are no customers. And no employees in sight.
Suddenly Ben sees a small dog barking at him from the top of
the stairs.
Ben takes a step toward the dog to calm him down but the dog
goes running off out of sight.
BEN (CONT’D)
Hello? Hello?
Ben, not hearing anything, wipes his forehead with the inside
of his shirt and saunters in further, seeing no one. He
starts up the stairs.
Upstairs he sees no one either. He sits down on a bench at
the top and decides to wait. He places his satchel beside the
banister and puts his head down on one arm. He yawns.
He doesn’t see (or hear) an OLD MAN approaching from the rear
of the store with an inventory book.
OLD MAN
(calling out)
I’m sorry... she can be a little
high strung first thing in the
morning... Hello?
The Old Man doesn’t see anyone, and shrugs. He squeezes
through the front counter and grabs a stool.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
(absently, to the dog
upstairs)
You’re scaring off the customers...
The Old Man reaches over and presses a button on a stereo on
a shelf behind him. The 1920’s music stops. He removes a
cassette then roots through a stack of other cassettes next
to the player. He picks something out, pops it into the
stereo and presses play.
Very quietly, MUSIC begins... hissing through the cassette
recording but very slowly taking hold of the room and,
seemingly, of Ben, whose eyes grow heavy, resting on the
stairs just above.
The music is ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA by Deodato, the jazzfunk version of the classical piece of music.
And then, like a dream...

MUSIC continues over the otherwise silent city scape - cars
whizzing by, the street beginning to come alive with people but all we hear is MUSIC.
Through the crowd we begin to notice an OLD WOMAN with long
greying hair, some of which is tied up in a bun at the top of
her head. She is dressed smartly in a top with a little
bohemian edge to it. She has a large purse with her.
The Old Woman is weaving her way through the crowd.
She nears her destination, turns a corner. And there it is:

The MUSIC SOFTENS. For the first time we can see that it’s
the same Old Woman from the museum. She is smiling. But we
can tell that there’s a lot of history, a lot of careful
watching, in that face.
She addresses the Old Man at the counter, who looks up from
his book, and stands.
They begin to communicate in sign language, their hands
moving gracefully through the air.
OLD MAN
(in sign language)
What took you so long? I was
getting worried!
OLD WOMAN
(in sign language,
smiling)
Sorry! A lot to do before I left.

indicating the Old Woman should wait, then picks up the phone
and begins to talk.

OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Hello, Kincaids... Yes, of course.
We have lots of Dickens... Oh yes,

Yep - open ‘til five every day. You

(he hangs up phone,
continues signing)
You can still help me with the
inventory?
OLD WOMAN
(in sign language)
Yes. You know I love making order
out of your chaos.
OLD MAN
I like you too - you’re cheap
labor!
They both laugh.
The two old people continue to sign (about how he fixed the
A/C, and just in time, etc.)
All the while, the store has become invaded by a strange
presence, a softly rising shimmer of anticipation.
Suddenly the small dog comes tearing past Ben, scrambling
down the stairs.
Ben, startled, gasps, jolting himself awake - which makes the
OLD MAN below suddenly look up. This makes the OLD WOMAN turn
as well and Ben, seeing them both looking up at him, leap to
his feet. He grabs the banister for balance, letting his bag
go sliding down the banister rail before it topples,
overturning SOUND - The satchel lands with a thud, its contents spilling
out all over the floor.
The Old Man and Woman look from fallen bag back up to Ben,
startled and confused, standing at the top of the stairs.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Oh - Hello. I didn’t see you there.
Are you... Did I wake you?
Ben stares down at him, disoriented. He shakes his head,
pointing to his ear.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)

Oh!... You can’t hear?

Ben looks at them, shaking his head.
BEN

He doesn’t know sign.
BEN
You can hear?
The Old Man nods.
Yes.

OLD MAN

BEN
But she’s deaf?
Yes.

The Old Man nods again. He translates this into sign for the
old woman. Ben, still making sense of his sudden companions,
takes a step toward them, gingerly.
BEN
I had an accident recently. That’s
why I can’t hear.
The Old Man translates this to the Old Woman.
OLD MAN
You scared us!
The Old Man holds up a finger to the boy, grabs a pad and pen
from his desk, and starts writing.
Ben continues slowly down the stairs as the Old Man holds up
his message: Can we help you?
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
(then, to Ben, enunciating
his words)
Are you okay?
Ben understands and nods.
BEN
Yeah, thanks. I’m sorry I just...
fell asleep for a second.

WONDERSTRUCK

76.

He goes to collect his fallen belongings and put them back
into his satchel.
The Old Woman kneels down to help Ben collect his things. She
picks up an old book that had fallen out, and turns it over,
revealing Ben’s copy of WONDERSTRUCK.
She stops, staring at the cover of her book, then tilts it in
the direction of the Old Man. He stiffens when he sees it and
turns to look the Old Woman in the eye. Then they both look
at Ben.
Ben stops, realizing they are staring at him with the oddest
expression. In the eyes of the Old Woman he sees confusion
and wonderment and sadness, all rolled into one.
She glances down again at the drawings and photos that Ben
had taken from the museum. When she looks back up at Ben,
tears have flooded her eyes. She sways, losing balance, and
the Old Man grabs ahold of her. She wipes the tears from her
eyes. To the Old Man:
OLD WOMAN
(in sign language)
Do you realize who this boy is?
OLD MAN
(in sign language):
Is it possible? Can it be true?
He helps her to her feet and she steps back, regaining her
balance. Overwhelmed. Almost afraid. Then, urgently:
OLD WOMAN
(signing to old man):
How did he end up here? How?
The old man gestures to indicate: I have no idea!
Ben stares back, confused and perplexed. He feels a
strangeness in his body he can’t explain.
The Old Woman takes the pen and notebook. She writes with
trembling fingers and turns the paper towards him so he can
read it. It says:
Ben?
Ben looks at her in shock.
BEN
How do you know my name?

WONDERSTRUCK

77.

The Old Man translates Ben’s words into sign, but the Old
Woman, who can lip read well, stays fixed on Ben. She writes
in the notebook: Where is your mother?
Ben, unsure how to answer at first, takes out his wallet and
hands her the article about his mom’s death.
She gasps, sharing it with the Old Man.
BEN (CONT’D)
Did you know her?
She hands Ben back the article.
The Old Man writes: How did you find us?
Ben roots around in his pockets and finds the Kincaid’s book
mark. He points to the note on the back, handing it to the
Old Woman.
Rose looks at the bookmark and reads: Elaine, I’ll wait for
you. Love, Danny.
Her eyes well with tears, she turns to Walter and shows him.
BEN (CONT’D)
I came here trying to find my
father. Do you know him?
The Old Man translates for the Woman.
BEN (CONT’D)
Who are you? How do you know my
name?
Rose writes a note for Ben: I’m Rose. This is my brother
Walter.
Rose signs their names. Walter, the Old Man, nods, smiles
gently. Ben is confused.
BEN (CONT’D)

ROSE

Walter)
I need to take him to the museum.
He deserves to know his story but I
can’t tell him here.
Walter nods, in agreement.
Rose writes a note and stands, showing it to Ben: Come with
me
Where?

BEN

She reads his lips but signs to Walter instead:
ROSE
I’ll find you later...
WALTER
(mouths)
You want me to come with you?
Rose reads his lips and shakes her head, heading to the front
door. They exchange signs that mean I love you.
She gestures for Ben. And Ben follows her out the door,
glancing back to Walter at the last moment, confused but
undeterred.

Ben follows as she leads him to an empty bench and sits,
motioning him to join her. There she pulls out the notebook
and pen, opens to a clean page - and pauses. Ben stares at
the side of her face.
Then Rose looks down and starts to write.
When Ben glances down at the page, she keeps writing but
turns slightly away so he can’t read it yet.
A crowd slowly gathers, awaiting the next bus. The bus
arrives but Rose keeps writing.

pocket. Then she grabs Ben’s hand, hurrying them onto the
bus.

SOUND. Ben and Rose are walking by the Unisphere, the giant
silver globe from the 1964 World’s Fair. Lightning flashes in
the distance.
They come to a large building and find the entrance.
Lettering over the door reads:
THE QUEENS MUSEUM
The museum is closed today, but Rose reaches into her bag and
pulls out a key. She puts the key in the door and they enter.

She opens a panel in the wall and presses a few buttons on a
control panel.
Light suddenly floods the room.
Ben’s eyes adjust to the light and he gasps.
He can’t believe what he’s seeing.
The Panorama. A scale model of the five boroughs of New York
City. 895,000 buildings, 10,000 square feet. Ben looks into
the miniature city, glimpsing the hand-painted windows and
the paper facades glued to the tiny wood buildings.
It’s glorious.
Rose leads him onto the Panorama.

BEN
What is this? Where are we?
Rose sits on a bench at the edge of the Panorama and
indicates Ben should sit too. She takes out her pad and turns
to the beginning of the story she’d written on the subway.
She hands it to Ben.
As he begins to read, we zoom across the Panorama.
BEN (V.O.)
“I need you to be patient with this
story and read it slowly. I’ve
worked in the Queens Museum for
fifteen years now, but the story I
need to tell you begins a long time
before that.
We come to the tiny Unisphere and the model of the Queens
Museum itself on the Panorama...
BEN (V.O.)
“When I was a little girl, in 1927,
I came to New York for the very
first time...”
We fly to the model of the American Museum of Natural History
on the Panorama.
BEN (V.O.)
“It was my brother Walter who
finally rescued me. I found him at
The Museum of Natural History where
he was working...”
We continue to fly across the Panorama...
BEN (V.O.)
“I begged him to help me, to get me
away from our mother and father. I
wanted to stay in New York, I
wanted to learn things!”
We come to a stop in front of the model of a school, a tiny
wooden structure with a paper facade.
Ben continues to read.
BEN (V.O.)
“The first thing Walter did was
help me find a school for deaf
children. I didn’t even know such a
thing existed!”

all-girl classroom with miniature figures of deaf students
learning sign language:
BEN (V.O.)
“My parents divorced when I was
very young. It was a big scandal
back then because my mother was
famous...”
A miniature figure of Rose sits with two girls, one of whom
shares a movie magazine with Lillian Mayhew on the cover.
Through the door to the hall, Rose spots the miniature
figures of boys coming out of the printing press room, their
hands black from typesetting.
One handsome boy, (BILL), a little older than Rose herself,
is sharing a hand rag with a schoolmate. He smiles at her,
sweetly, in his rolled-up shirtsleeves.
The miniature figure of Rose smiles back.
BEN (V.O.)
“It was there at school I met my
Bill, who was training to be a
printer. We married and before we
knew it had a baby boy.”
WE SWEEP across the streets of Manhattan.

Ben looks up at Rose. She gestures to a TV built into the
exhibition, which Ben turns to.
On the screen WE SEE:

The camera soaring over the actual city of New York, as Ben
continues reading:
BEN (V.O.)
“One of those attractions was going
to be the Panorama, a scale model
of the entire city of New York, all
five boroughs, all 895,000
buildings, the largest
architectural model ever built. It
was an opportunity I couldn’t pass
up so I left the Museum of Natural

Queens.”
The AERIAL view of Manhattan dissolves into:

BEN (V.O.)
“Sadly, my Bill had passed away by

Now the Panorama turns into:

The Panorama in miniature, being worked on and installed by a
hive of miniature women workers. We finally arrive at the

BEN (V.O.)
“Around that time, our son was
appointed the lead designer on a
new diorama at the Museum of

Ben realizes what this means. He stares at Rose.
BEN (CONT’D)

You’re my grandmother?
Rose reads his lips and nods, instinctively signing the word
for grandmother. Tears come to her eyes.
BEN (CONT’D)
Where is he? I came all the way

Rose gets up and leads Ben out onto the Atlantic Ocean.
They carefully walk up towards Manhattan, like giants.
They step over the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

Their feet clear the tiny cables of the bridge.
Rose leads Ben up the narrow stretch of the East River,
stepping over the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge and
the Williamsburg bridge.
Ben looks across the model, like Gulliver in Lilliput.
Rose points to the writing pad, indicating he should keep
reading. Of course the answer is already in his hands.
Ben looks at the page...
BEN (V.O.)

headlights.
DANNY

Miss Wilson? Is that you? Am I at

The miniature figure of Elaine emerges into the light. Her
hair is in a ponytail. She is young and beautiful.
ELAINE
You are indeed, Mr. Lobel - not an
easy feat this time of year. The
cabin is right over there.
The miniature figure of DANNY (early 30’s, handsome), calls
out again from the window of his truck.

A miniature of the hallway with the wolf diorama, just as the
rear painted sky and horizon of the actual diorama is being

Danny and his crew observe the process with acute attention,
taking in the final result: the wolves leaping, the blue
snow, the stars, the aurora borealis...

Ben has come to the end of the writing. He turns to Rose, who
pulls the last few pages from her pocket. She’s been holding
on to them. She hands them gently to Ben.
BEN (V.O.)
“Your dad was ill Ben, he had a
heart condition, the same one his
father had. It kept him out of the
war. But a few years after he
returned from Gunflint Lake, his
heart...”
Ben looks up at Rose.
Night is falling in the Panorama and the fluorescent lights
are coming up again across the city.
Ben looks away. Rose takes his hand. He lets her take him in
her arms and he starts to cry.
Soon the lights start to come up across the city. Rose has
been crying too.
She points again to the notebook. Ben doesn’t want to keep
reading, but Rose insists...

Ben and Rose are standing on the East River.
Rose leads Ben around the southern tip of Manhattan, stepping
over the bridges again. They head up the other side of the
island, along the Hudson River, until they are standing on
the blue painted water that separates Manhattan from New
Jersey.
Rose carefully leans over the Panorama, grips the American
Museum of Natural History and pulls upward. There is a little
resistance but the entire city block gives way.
Rose turns it over and picks out a piece of paper folded long
ago. She opens it and hands it to Ben.
It’s a child’s drawing of two wolves running through the
snow.
Ben thinks Danny must have drawn it, but then he looks at the
signature on the drawing and is shocked.
It’s signed: Ben.
He looks up at Rose.

gathering beneath the blue whale - which we might recognize
as the same toy whale that had been in Ben’s room earlier.
We see the miniature figure of Rose, standing with the other
mourners. She turns to see:

others, with a miniature figure of 4-year-old BEN at her

Ben and Rose look out across the Panorama. In the distance we
hear something that Ben and Rose can not: THUNDER. But
something else catches Rose’s attention.
A slight vibration.
She pauses.
We see the tiny flags on the model of the Queens Museum, far
out on the Panorama, vibrate ever so slightly with each crash
of thunder.

There is rumbling, a terrible crash that Ben and Rose don’t
flinch at.
But there’s something strange that Rose is aware of.
BEN
...that’s why I dreamed of them,

Rose looks at Ben, reminding him she can’t understand him if
he’s facing away from her. She points to the paper. She wants

Then, another much louder crash of thunder, the lights
flicker for a moment.
The flags on the model of the Queens museum vibrate again.
Then...

We watch as lightning hits the city and sections of New York
flicker off, the lighting grid going black, until the entire
city is without power, and it stands in silhouette against
the night sky.

The miniature city is plunged into darkness as well. We hear
breathing and unsteady footsteps and gasps. We hear the sound

Hello? What happened? Help!
Rose makes a strangled sound that might be the word “come,”
but it’s hard to tell...
In the dimmest dark we spot Rose taking a step toward Ben grabbing his hand. More breathing. The Panorama creaks
beneath their feet.
After several more tense moments: A flash of light with a
brief bursting sound.

From an adjoining street a van is screeching crazily along a
dark empty block. We can hear the radio from inside the van,
(and just make out the name painted on the side: Klein Gutter
Service) in the middle of a report about the blackout. The
van careens out of sight, followed by the rise of an
approaching police siren.
Rose instinctively pulls the boy closer to the door of the
museum. Then she gets an idea. She brings the boys back
inside the museum and locks the door behind her.
But we remain outside, watching as they vanish into the dark
building.
We begin to float upwards, coasting along the side of the
museum, a movement that feels as if we’re caught on a gentle
breeze.
The steadiness of the movement, however, is in contrast to
the sounds we hear, the indications of violence and danger
somewhere in the darkness.
But as we continue our ascent up the side of the building,
the sounds begin to diminish.
We find ourselves at the roof of the museum with the round
skeleton of the Unisphere silhouetted against the night sky.
Trees shake.
We travel onwards, across the roof now, past the ducts and
air vents and flag poles, the debris gathered along the
gutter of the roof.
The sounds are almost all gone now.

And finally, we reach our destination.
We’ve caught up with Rose, Ben and Jamie, who have come to

They are standing in the gutter, looking down over a low
wall.
Rose squeezes Ben’s arm, then she points to Jamie, wanting to
know who he is.
Unnoticed by Rose are more sounds in the background. A crash,
a shout.
Rose repeats herself, signing: Who is this?
Ben looks at Jamie, who looks back at him. A kind of
understanding passes between them.
Ben touches his palm to his chest (indicating: my) then
raises his right hand and begins to fingerspell:
BEN
F. R I. E. N. D.
Jamie’s eyes shift from Ben’s hand to his face. He mouths his
reply in silence, affirming what Ben has finger-spelled:
Friend.

JAMIE

Rose takes Ben’s hand. He looks up at her with love. He turns
to Jamie, with the same dazzled look, and takes Jamie’s hand.
Their faces, lit by moonlight, shine with surprise.
They turn to the unlit skyline of Manhattan: quiet, dark,
mysterious.
Above it, hovering in the sky, a canopy of stars as clear and
bright as any in Gunflint Lake. The big dipper shines like
diamonds vaulting through the night.
At this distance, in the strange silence, the city has become
a place of peace.
And at this moment the three of them are happy, looking at
the stars.
Jamie points up. Ben and Rose look.
A meteor blazes across the sky.
