INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - MORNING
We open with QUICK DETAIL SHOTS of a young boy dressing:
- a brown shirt buttoned.
- badges pinned.
- belt tightened.
- neck kerchief tied.
- shoelaces tied and shoes polished.
- socks pulled up to knees.
- hair combed.
- eye-pencil applied above top lip...??
- Shoes clicked together at the heels, one foot stomps down hard
on the floor.
He is dressed. We PULL to a CLOSE-UP, coming face to face with
our HERO...
JOHANNES BETZLER, (JOJO), a cute 10 year-old Boy. He stares into
a full-length mirror. He has drawn a HITLER moustache on his
upper lip.
JOJO
Jojo Betzler, ten and a half years
old. Today you join the ranks of the
Jungvolk. This is a great day, for
you, for your family, and for all of
Germany.
And as “BREATHLESS” by NICK CAVE kicks in, we PULL OUT to reveal
Jojo is dressed impeccably in a HITLER YOUTH uniform. He does a
little dance on the spot and then looks over to a wall covered
with pictures, posters and drawings of ADOLF HITLER.
Jojo tries to WINK at a prominent poster of the Führer however
he can’t close one eye independently so it’s more of a scrunched
up BLINK. He tries again, not happening. He turns back to the
mirror and does the NAZI SALUTE.
JOJO (CONT’D)
HEIL HITLER!!!
SUPER: “VIENNA, 1944”
EXT. STREET - DAY
With a confident stride Jojo walks down the street admiring
himself in store windows. He greets everyone he meets with the
Hitler salute.

2.
JOJO
Heil Hitler, Herr Josef!
(beat)
Heil Hitler, Frau Kirsch!
He is joined by his best friend YORKI, 11 years old, geeky, fat
and clumsy. They embrace.
Jojo!

YORKI

JOJO
Yorki! Heil Hitler!
YORKI
Heil Hitler!
They continue walking with excited energy.
JOJO
Looking good Yorki.
YORKI
You too, Jojo. Did you bring your
books?
JOJO
Of course. Now Yorki we must make a
big effort this weekend. It’s rare for
we Jungvolk to be allowed at a
Hitlerjugend training weekend and I
want to make a good impression. They
may promote us to Hitler’s Special
Guard early. Only the best of the best
get to do that.
YORKI
Yes, you and I will be best of the
best.
JOJO
The best Nazi’s the whole world has
ever seen.
They look a bit awkward and nerdy as they continue down the
street. They scream another Heil Hitler at each other, scaring
the shit out of an elderly woman walking past.
EXT. WOODS - HITLERJUGEND CAMP - DAY
Jojo and Yorki sit with other clean cut young children aged
between 10 and 13.

3.
CHILDREN
(singing)
I swear to devote all my energies and
my strength to the saviour of our
country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing
and ready to give up my life for him,
so help me God.
A group of older kids, true HITLER YOUTH, are gathered nearby. A
group of girls from the LEAGUE OF GERMAN GIRLS (BDM) march past
on their way to a separate training area. Jojo sneaks a quick
look at a pretty girl, GUDRUN (12). She returns a smile as
CAPTAIN KLENZENDORF, weathered, over looking after kids, steps
forward. He is accompanied by his camp, awkwardly enthusiastic
assistant, SUB-OFFICER FINKEL (20’s). Captain Klenzendorf
addresses the young crowd.
KLENZENDORF
Heil Hitler!
FINKEL
Heil Hitler!
KLENZENDORF
Jungvolk, welcome to our Hitlerjugend
training weekend in which we will make
men and women of you all. My name is
Captain Klenzendorf - you may call me
Captain K.
FINKEL
Captain K! Woohoo!
KLENZENDORF
...and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. You
may only call him Sub-Officer Finkel.
Over the next two days you will get a
taste of the Hitlerjugend experience
so you know what you’re in store for
once you’re old enough to join
yourself. You boys have all been
issued with your Deutsches Jungvolk
Daggers. Please take them out.
Jojo and Yorki inspect and admire their nice new DEUTSCHES
JUNGVOLK (DJ) KNIVES. Throughout the crowd we hear various yelps
as kids accidentally cut themselves with the blades.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
These are very special and expensive
weapons, you should never be without
them. And DO NOT try to stab each
other.

4.
FINKEL
No stabbing! Or you’ll die. From blood
loss.
KLENZENDORF
Now, this is your first step towards
being men. Today you boys will be
involved in such activities as
marching, bayonet drills, grenade
throwing, trench digging, map reading,
gas defence, camouflage, making traps,
ambush techniques, war games, firing
guns and blowing stuff up.
Huge cheers from the group of boys. Jojo and Yorki smile at each
other, this is going to be awesome.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
The girls will practice important
womanly duties such as nursing wounds,
making beds, and learning how to get
pregnant.
Groans of disappointment from the girls.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
Alright, let’s get to it. Are you
READY?!
CHILDREN
YES! HEIL HITLER!!!
The entire circle salutes, as do Jojo and Yorki. The BDM head
off towards a COMMUNITY HALL in a nearby field.
And “I DON’T WANNA GROW UP” by Tom Waits bursts to life, the
older boys start screaming at the smaller kids, rounding them
up, ordering them into groups and y’know, being teenage Nazi
assholes.
FINKEL
Move, move, move! On your feet you
little Hitlers!
MONTAGE - HITLER YOUTH TRAINING CAMP...
Various scenes of Jojo and Yorki training with the Hitlerjugend.
- KNIFE THROWING. Jojo and Yorki stand around with a group of
about 8 boys throwing their DJ knives from 10 FEET into a tree.
None of the knives stick, instead they fly off at dangerous
angles, one deflecting and lodging itself in another kid’s
THIGH.

5.
- GUN RANGE. Jojo stands, trying with all his might to aim a
KARABINER 98K RIFLE at a target in the distance. He fires and,
jumping from the loudness of the shot, drops the rifle.
- Inside the Hall, a group of girls attempt to dress fake wounds
on each other while in the background Sub-officer Finkel shows
other girls a sanitized and tame version of childbirth with an
anatomically INCORRECT diagram of a BABY inside a girl’s
stomach. It’s smiling.
FINKEL
Then a happy baby comes out. Yay!
- WAR GAME. The boys are separated into 2 groups, one side
wearing RED SASHES and the other GREEN. They chase each other
round a clearing, pushing each other over and taking prisoners
etc. Jojo and Yorki are taken prisoner instantly. An older boy
watches them and shakes his head disapprovingly.
INT. WOODS - GROUP CIRCLE - DUSK
Jojo sits in a group of boys and girls. One by one, sometimes
overlapping the children call out.
CHILDREN
Horns. Serpent tongue. Fangs.
Green blood. Claws.
Cut to their teacher, FRAULEIN RAHM, who proudly writes the
children’s words, along with others, on a blackboard. Above them
is the heading: THE JEW. Finkel stands nearby, observing and
taking notes.
FRAULEIN RAHM
Fantastisch! Excellent work children.
You also forgot that the Jew is the
offspring of Satan and sucks the blood
of Christian children for their
mitzvah.
Horrified gasps from the children. Finkel nods.
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
By the time the inferior race catches
up to where we are today, we’ll be way
up here.
Rahm sketches a mountain with chalk. She draws a peak too steep
to be stable. The top of the peak is all skinny and wobbly.

6.
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
It has been scientifically proven that
we Aryans are 1000 times more advanced
and civilised than any other race.
Gasps and applause from the children. Fraulein Rahm smiles.
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
Now, get your things together, it’s
time to burn some books!
Yayyyy!!!

CHILDREN

They gather together and move towards another area where a LARGE
BONFIRE burns. The children hold stacks of books. Jojo opens his
bag and pulls out a small pile.
YORKI
Is that it? Only 4 books?
JOJO
It’s all I could find on the list.
(reading the authors)
Kafka... Brecht... Hesse... Burn you
losers.
He throws them into the fire, Yorki follows suit. The books land
among other burning authors, FREUD, LESSING, MANN, PROUST,
HEMINGWAY, REMARQUE.
SLOW MOTION as the children all dance round the bonfire,
throwing books into the inferno.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Jojo and Yorki lie awake in sleeping bags under the night sky
inspecting their new DJ KNIVES.
JOJO
Imagine being in a battle, you’ve just
run out of ammo, all you have is your
DJ Knife. I would take down 20 of them
before they got me. And I’d be
laughing when they did.
YORKI
I don’t like that situation. I don’t
want to die at all.
JOJO
Live Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and
Die Laughing... that’s the motto.

7.
YORKI
I know but I wouldn’t be laughing. I’d
probably be screaming.
JOJO
Then I’m afraid you might not be cut
out for Hitler’s personal guard. It’s
really hard to get chosen y’know. You
need to have perfect vision, perfect
teeth and you’re not allowed one ounce
of fat.
YORKI
(prodding his chubbiness)
Hey, Jews sound scary, huh?
JOJO
Yeah, I didn’t know they stole the
white skins of Aryans so they could
blend in. Savages!
YORKI
Me neither. Thankfully most got sent
back to their caves so it’s not likely
that we’ll see a real one.
JOJO
If I did I’d kill it like that.
He snaps his fingers.
YORKI
But how would you know if you saw one?
They can look just like us.
JOJO
Oh I’d know. I’d feel it’s head for
horns. And they smell like Brussel
Sprouts.
YORKI
Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussel
Sprouts bit.
JOJO
Imagine catching one and giving it to
Hitler. That’d be a sure-fire way to
get into his personal guard.
YORKI
He’d be so impressed.
JOJO
Then we would become best friends.

8.
YORKI
I thought I was your best friend.
JOJO
You’re my second best friend. First
place is reserved for someone really
special - like the Führer. He, and
only he can have that spot, so unless
you’re Hitler hiding in a fat little
boy’s body I’d be happy with 2nd
place.
YORKI
I’m just a kid.
JOJO
Case closed.
Jojo rolls over and stares at the sky.
JOJO (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Night papa, I hope you come home soon.
Night Inga, I hope you’re happy up
there.
A rustling noise can be heard, Jojo turns his head to see Yorki
doing sit-ups, gasping for air and prodding his tubby belly.
EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - MORNING
Jojo sits with a bunch of other kids. Two team leaders,
CHRISTOPH and HANS, (17) smoke cigarettes and hold court.
HANS
When you stand before a Roast Beef-man
and have to end his life, which of you
will have the stomach for it?
Everyone raises their hands. Jojo too, although a little slow.
HANS (CONT’D)
There is no room in Hitler’s army for
scared little girls and those who lack
strength. We want hardened warriors
who are prepared to kill at will. Can
you do that?
CHRISTOPH
Johannes? Can you kill?
JOJO
Pff, of course. I love killing.

9.
A few murmurs and nervous “Me too”s from the other children.
Good...

CHRISTOPH

Christoph uncovers a small cage nearby - it is filled with
little rabbits. Christoph takes a bunny from the cage and
holding it by its ears, hands it to Jojo.
Kill it.
Hmm?

CHRISTOPH (CONT’D)
JOJO

CHRISTOPH
Wring its neck. Kill the rabbit.
JOJO
Oh, I’m ok. I might do it later.
CHRISTOPH
No later, NOW. Or are you scared?
JOJO
No, I’m not scared. I just... I’m
allergic to fur and I don’t want itchy
hands for the rest of the weekend.
HANS
Itchy hands? Kill the damn rabbit and
be a soldier Jojo!
JOJO
I thought soldiers killed people, not
bunnies.
HANS
You must show you have an iron stomach
to undertake the work of eradicating
the parasite.
Hans hands it to shocked Jojo who takes the bunny.
HANS (CONT’D)
Place both hands around it’s neck and
then one hard, twist, sometimes two,
he might scream but drop him and we’ll
use the boot to finish it off.
Jojo shaking, holds the bunny and looks at it directly in the
eye. He gulps. The boys start to chant.

10.
HITLERJUGEND
Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill.
Jojo looks over at Yorki who is frozen. He turns back to face
the woods away from the group. He leans down. The boys are like
baying excited wolves. They crouch in around Jojo as he leans
down. He DROPS the bunny but it doesn’t run. Christoph takes the
rabbit and snaps its neck. Shocked gasps and a few squeaks of
horror from the other kids.
CHRISTOPH
Coward. Just like your father.
JOJO
He’s not a coward, he’s in Italy.
CHRISTOPH
No one has heard from him in 2 years.
He’s a deserting coward just like you.
HANS
Yes, he’s a deserter.
JOJO
No, he doesn’t do that, he fights.
CHRISTOPH
You’re as scared as a rabbit.
He places a boot on Jojo’s head and kicks him to the ground.
Hans places a boot on his neck.
HANS
Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should
snap your neck.
KID
Rabbit. Coward.
ANOTHER KID
Jojo rabbit.
The rest of the kids taunt Jojo. He stands and runs into the
woods, laughter following close behind.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
Jojo sits alone on a log, sobbing to himself. He looks up to see
a little BUTTERFLY flitting around by his feet... and then a
voice comes from behind.
VOICE (O.S.)
Poor Jojo, what is wrong?

11.
Jojo turns around, it is none other than his fantasy friend,
ADOLF HITLER. Jojo brightens at the sight of his hero.
Hi Adolf.

JOJO

Adolf takes a seat. This is not the Adolf we know and hate, this
guy is goofy, charming, and glides through life with a childlike naivety; a real dork.
ADOLF
Why so down in the dumps little man? A
strong boy like yourself shouldn’t be
sad, you should be happy like a cloud!
Clouds don’t care about anything!
JOJO
The other kids called me a coward. And
my papa, they say he makes desserts
instead of fighting. But I know he’s
still fighting, for you, for me, and
for Germany.
ADOLF
Oh, of course he is! And he is also
making nice desserts, nothing wrong
with that. My God, his custard tarts
are the only thing keeping up morale
at the front.
JOJO
Do you think he can come home soon?
Just for a quick visit?
ADOLF
Well, I kinda need him for those
special missions and whatnot. And the
desserts are also an important factor.
Really?

JOJO

ADOLF
Mm-hm. He’s one of my top men. Now,
want to tell me about the rabbit
incident? What was that all about?
JOJO
They wanted me to kill it. I’m sorry.
ADOLF
Meh, don’t worry about it. I couldn’t
care less. I’m a cloud.

12.
JOJO
But now they call me a scared rabbit.
ADOLF
Well you want to know something?
(off Jojo’s nod)
Just because they’re small and
delightfully cute doesn’t mean rabbits
are cowards. The rabbit faces a
dangerous world everyday, hunting
carrots for his family... for his
country. Forget those boys. They have
their place and so do you. My empire
will be made up of all animals,
eagles, lions, elephants and even
rabbits.
Hitler lights a cigarette, offers Jojo a drag.
JOJO
No thanks, I don’t sm-ADOLF
But not those Egyptian horses with
bumpy-backs. I don’t trust them.
JOJO
You mean camels?
ADOLF
(laughing, condescending)
Errm, I don’t think they’re called
that.
(beat)
Remember this good advice Jojo, be the
rabbit. The bunny can outwit all his
enemies!
He winks at Jojo who tries to wink back but still can only
manage a weird double wink-blink. Adolf kicks a defenceless
stick.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
“Camels”, ha!
(aside)
What’s in those bumps I wonder? Gold?
More humps? Baby Camels? I guess we’ll
never know their secrets!
JOJO
(to himself)
Be the Rabbit...

13.
EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - DAY
The older boys are getting instructions from Captain Klenzendorf
on throwing hand-grenades. They stand around within a sort of
trench set-up. The young kids sit back, behind the trench at a
safe distance. Finkel stands nervously to the side, sort of
hiding behind Klenzendorf.
KLENZENDORF
Now lads, the hand-grenade is one of
the most effective weapons in the
German army. It can blow off a leg,
maybe 2 legs, definitely a head. It is
very dangerous. Just quietly, I prefer
the rounder, egg-shaped version used
by the British and Americans. I dunno,
it just seems silly that our ones look
like sticks.
FINKEL
Sticks... pff.
He continues talking in the background as Jojo approaches the
young kids and sidles up next to Yorki.
YORKI
Are you alright Jojo?
JOJO
Absolutely, I was just doing some pushups for my muscles.
YORKI
I thought you were crying.
JOJO
Nope. Push-ups.
(flexing his tiny arm )
And don’t just assume that because
water comes from someone’s eyes that
they are crying, okay? Are you a teardrop specialist?
No.

YORKI

JOJO
Case closed. Now, Yorki Dorky, it’s
time for Jojo to show these big pipsqueaks who is a coward. I mean, NOT a
coward - me. You’ll see what I mean.
He takes a deep breath and scurries off into the bushes.

14.
YORKI
(loud whisper)
Jojo! Where are you going? Don’t you
want to watch the hand-grenades?
We are back with the older group.
KLENZENDORF
Now you little kids stay all the way
over there and watch the action.
(to the older kids)
Each of you will be given the
opportunity to arm and throw a
grenade. ONE AT A TIME. I will
personally be supervising each-Suddenly, in a flurry of noise and action, Jojo bursts out of
the bushes and onto the scene.
JOJO
Jojo rabbit! Jojo rabbit! Hunting
carrots, Jojo rabbit!
He runs past the boys, grabs one of the GRENADES from the open
box and darts out, over the top of the trench and into the HOT
ZONE - a wooded area stretching out before the group.
KLENZENDORF
You! Get back here with that!!!
But Jojo is off, he runs from the group. Adolf Hitler runs
beside him, goading him on, screaming things like “Jojo Rabbit!”
They reach a little clearing where Jojo pulls the PIN on the
grenade and screams an ungodly war-cry.
JOJO
JOJO RABBIIIIIIIIT!!!
He hurls the grenade like a war hero. It flies through the air,
bounces off a tree, hits another one, deflects off a nearby
branch and ricochets backwards, landing only 6-feet away from
Jojo.
Scheisse.

ADOLF

He bolts, getting clear and leaving Jojo standing alone, the
grenade at his feet.
JOJO
Ooh, scheisse...
KABOOM!!! Jojo goes flying in an explosion of smoke and debris.

15.
SFX: HEAVY BREATHING...
FADE OUT.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
JOJO’S POV - The next couple of minutes are small glimpses as
Jojo comes in and out of consciousness.
- Bright lights in an operating room. A doctor hovers over us,
we see INSTRUMENTS. A concerned Adolf Hitler peeks in, smiles
and gives us the thumbs up. Jojo’s BLOODIED THUMB comes into
view.
- Over BLACK, we hear voices. Fade up to see a concerned male
doctor and Captain Klenzendorf.
KLENZENDORF
It was one of those stick-shaped ones,
not the superior oval type. Do you
know the ones I mean?
Finkel holds up one a stick grenade.
Like this.

FINKEL

KLENZENDORF
Exactly. Anyway, luckily it was only a
training grenade, half packed with
explosive. A proper one would have
blown off his leg. Maybe both.
FINKEL
Probably both. Or a head.
KLENZENDORF
(aside, to doctor)
Do you think I could get in trouble
for this?
- FADE UP as we hear the sound of Jojo’s mother, FRAU BETZLER,
entering the room. She comes in to focus, a beautiful and kind
face.
FRAU BETZLER
Darling Jojo, my cub... I’m taking you
home.
- The shot wells with tears, de-focuses, and fades.

16.
- Over black we hear sounds. We come in and out of a hazy
picture of Frau Betzler sitting beside Jojo, her hand caressing
his face. We are in his bedroom now, the Hitler posters still on
the wall. His mother comes in and out of focus. The image shifts
and we see various small, STUFFED ANIMALS, on the pillow next to
him - a LION, an ELEPHANT, a CAMEL, a RABBIT.
WE FADE TO BLACK AND HEAR WHISPERS, PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jojo wakes in a daze. Feeling something nearby, Jojo sits
absolutely silent. A creak is heard directly outside his open
door. He whispers.
Hello?

JOJO

The creaking stops. Jojo cowers under the blankets.
JOJO (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Inga, don’t scare me. Please.
FADE OUT.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - MORNING
A NEW JOJO stands before us in front of the mirror. The right
side of his face is SCARRED. His RIGHT ARM hangs limply by his
side. He wears a simple shirt, he still has his hair and
although he is half the boy he used to be, with his injuries he
now looks older, kind of cooler.
FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)
There’s my little cub.
In the mirror Jojo sees his mother standing at the door,
smiling.
JOJO
Heil Hitler, Mama!!!
FRAU BETZLER
Wow, a little louder nest time huh?
Didn’t quite hear you. Hello darling.
She approaches and hugs him tightly, smiling.
JOJO
Why so happy? Your son is a monster.

17.
FRAU BETZLER
No. Not a monster, you’re still my
beautiful Jojo. Besides the doctors
are confident you will get most of the
movement back in your hand and you
will also walk properly again. Neat
huh? I’m just happy to have you back
home.
JOJO
I’ll never be in Hitler’s guard, now.
FRAU BETZLER
Don’t try so hard to be like the
others Jojo. You’re fine as you are.
JOJO
I need to be better.
FRAU BETZLER
You need to be you, not Mr. Uber
German. Look, Mama Lion worries about
her cub, that’s all. Especially when
papa Lion isn’t here.
JOJO
Or Inga Lion.
FRAU BETZLER
Or Inga Lion.
JOJO
Mama, you don’t have to worry about
me. I’m a tough guy and I will look
after us. You wait, I’ll make you the
proudest mother in the whole wide
Reich.
She smiles sadly. Jojo tries to tie his bootlaces. He is having
trouble with only one good hand. Frau Betzler kneels down and
helps him.
FRAU BETZLER
A few more months and you’ll get it.
Round the tree, through the rabbit
hole, then pull.
(then)
Now, you better get on your way, I
told the Hitlerjugend office you were
coming in today.
JOJO
I thought you didn’t want me to be
involved with all that.

18.
FRAU BETZLER
I don’t want you involved in being
dead on some battlefield. You can’t be
a soldier but you can still help. I
think getting out of the house will do
wonders for your recuperation. Come
on, you can walk me to the food store
first. We need supplies.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo’s mother helps him put on his jacket and he catches another
glimpse of himself reflected in some glass.
JOJO
I don’t want to go out there.
FRAU BETZLER
Don’t be silly, of course you do.
JOJO
But people will look at me.
FRAU BETZLER
Let them! Enjoy the attention, kid.
(feigning sadness, stroking
her hair)
People used to look at me.
(suddenly bright)
Oh well! Now, you’re going to pluck up
your courage, walk out that door and
have an adventure. Okay?
JOJO
(nodding, unsure)
Okay.
Frau Betzler parts the blinds on the front door and peeks
outside.
FRAU BETZLER
Looks like the coast is clear. Field
Marshall Jojo, you’re our top man,
only you can accomplish this
mission... Good luck.
Jojo smiles and prepares himself, playing along.
JOJO
Is it dangerous?
His mother WINKS at him and smiles wide.

19.

Extremely.

FRAU BETZLER

She kisses him on the head and opens the door.
EXT. TOWN - STREET / RATION STORE - DAY
Jojo and his mother walk down the street. As he LIMPS, Jojo
tries to avoid peoples’ gazes. His mother enters a FOOD RATION
STORE leaving Jojo outside. He notices himself in the store
window and from his POV we see the new, crooked and damaged
version of the sprightly young boy at the beginning of our
story.
We PULL FOCUS to within the store. Frau Betzler takes a bag of
food and loads them into a shopping stroller. Other people in
the store watch her.
I/E. REICHSJUGENDAMT OFFICE - DAY
Jojo and Frau Betzler part ways outside the Reichsjugendamt
(Hitler Youth office), a small but official looking structure.
FRAU BETZLER
You have a wonderful day, cub.
(then)
Oh, you have something on your shirt.
She points and Jojo looks down. It’s the old trick where she
brings her hand up to ding him in the face. He laughs.
Don’t!

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
What? You really do have something!
Look!
She does it again and once more he falls for it.
JOJO
Stop it, Mama! Don’t hit me!
FRAU BETZLER
I’m not hitting you, you’re hitting
yourself!
She grabs his wrists and makes Jojo lightly swat himself in the
face, again and again. He giggles, absolutely powerless.

20.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
Heyyy kid, don’t beat yourself up.
You’re a good guy, no need for all
this violence!
She’s a real clown and utterly charming. She wraps him up and
gives him FIVE HUGE SMOOCHES all over his face.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
I love you. Heil Shitler.
We reveal Jojo’s face is covered in lipstick kiss-marks. She
heads off down the street, whistling.
INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo enters a large office. There is the usual Nazi Propaganda
on the walls and a large SWASTIKA FLAG hangs behind a SECRETARY
who sits at a desk looking incredibly bored. Two TEENAGE YOUTH
OFFICERS laze about while a couple of other children come and go
through the scene.
JOJO
(screaming)
HEIL HITLER!!
The secretary and Officers jump.
Jesus kid.

SECRETARY

OFFICERS
Heil Hitler.
SECRETARY
(eyeing Jojo)
What happened to you?
JOJO
Wounded in battle. I was blown up.
SECRETARY
What was it, a lipstick bomb?
Jojo realizes what she means and he quickly wipes his face.
OFFICER 1
(smirking)
A war hero! Well, how can we help you?
JOJO
Well. I am here to offer my serv--

21.
VOICE (O.S.)
I know that voice...
A figure emerges from an office - Captain Klenzendorf. Seeing
Jojo’s injuries he winces a little but covers well. He is
followed by Sub-Officer Finkel who is buttoning up his jacket.
KLENZENDORF
Heyyyy Johannes! Looking good.
JOJO
Hello Herr Klenzendorf.
KLENZENDORF
You remember Unteroffiziere Finkel.
Finkel nods to Jojo and continues to look weird and out of
place.
FINKEL
Heil Hitler, little boy.
KLENZENDORF
(to the others)
Guys this is Johannes Betzler, the kid
I told you about. Remember, he stole a
hand grenade and blew himself up and
as a result I was demoted for
negligence and now have to work in
this office.
JOJO
I am sorry you were demoted.
KLENZENDORF
Oh it’s fine. I wasn’t really
enthusiastic about that training camp
stuff. Little Nazis running around,
maniacal singing and histrionics.
Migraine hell.
(then)
Your mother came in the other day and
explained your situation.
JOJO
What did she say?
KLENZENDORF
Only that it’s just the two of you at
home now, and that you wanted to help
out here. Your father is a soldier,
no?

22.
JOJO
Yes, he is fighting with the 10th Army
in Italy. And he makes desserts.
KLENZENDORF
And you had a sister.
JOJO
Inga. She died of influenza.
KLENZENDORF
I’m sorry to hear that. Well, it would
seem you are the man of the house so
we’ll have to keep you busy.
A beat - not sure what to do next, everyone stares at Jojo.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
Ideas guys?
OFFICER 1
Umm, well, I guess you could hand out
some of this information.
He indicates a large pile of pamphlets in the corner.
OFFICER 2
And deliver these conscriptions.
JOJO
Conscripts. I don’t suppose I could
have one of those could I? I’m
actually in peak physical condition.
KLENZENDORF
Maybe later, Jojo, you’re still on the
mend. For now you can start small.
Conscripts and propaganda.
JOJO
Your wish is my command. I will
execute my orders with precision and
strength. Wait, what’s the difference
between information and propaganda?
Beat.
FINKEL
Just deliver the stuff , kid.
Ja wohl!

JOJO

He turns on his heels and is OUT.

23.
EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY
Jojo pins up some posters of HITLER in a stoic pose, looking off
into the distance. Below him is the propaganda slogan:
ONE PEOPLE, ONE EMPIRE, ONE LEADER
Jojo smiles at this image of the mighty Führer. He gives a happy
“Heil Hitler” to people who pass by, but we get the feeling the
public are losing enthusiasm in their salutes.
JOJO
Heil Hitler, Frau Baumer!
FRAU BAUMER
Hmm? Oh yes, Sieg Heil.
JOJO
Heil Hitler, Herr Koch.
Hmm?

HERR KOCH

(seeing Jojo’s injuries)
Oooh, yikes.
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - DAY
Jojo jauntily walks through a large town square where he sees a
number of locals grouped near some trees. He gets closer and
sees they are gathered before a make-shift GALLOWS. About FIVE
BODIES, men and women hang from the GALLOWS while onlookers
stare or take photos.
There are signs around their necks but we don’t see what is
written on them. Jojo moves on, taking occasional glimpses back.
I/E. GRUSCH GROCERY - DAY
He reaches a small GROCERY STORE. He enters and approaches the
quiet and sad-eyed Herr Grusch.
JOJO
Heil Hitler, Herr Grusch.
HERR GRUSCH
(seeing Jojo’s injuries)
What happened to you?
JOJO
War wound. I’ll probably get a medal.
(then)
(MORE)

24.
JOJO (CONT'D)
Herr Grusch, I have here a
conscription notice for your son.
Wait, is his name Klaus?
Herr Grusch sighs.
HERR GRUSCH
Yes, it is, but he already joined.
JOJO
Where is he?
The old man points upwards.
JOJO (CONT’D)
Oh, I’m sorry. The Führer would be
proud.
HERR GRUSCH
That’s comforting.
(Taking the letter)
Klaus is also my name.
JOJO
But you’re...
HERR GRUSCH
They’re recruiting us veterans of the
Great War now. There are no more young
people left. This whole thing is
becoming very flimsy. I don’t know how
to operate a flame-thrower or antitank gun. So stupid.
He throws his conscription down.
JOJO
(turning)
You are more able than I Herr Grusch.
Everyone must do their part and that
includes you. I hope I do not need to
tell the authorities of your
indolence.
(beat)
Heil Hitler!
A long beat. Herr Grusch smiles warmly and nods.
HERR GRUSCH
Bye Johannes.
Jojo turns on his heels and leaves.

25.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM
Jojo arrives home.
JOJO
Mama! I’m home.
He drops his satchel and heads for the kitchen.
JOJO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Maaaama, Field Marshall Jojo is home.
He returns.
Mama Lion?

JOJO (CONT’D)

We hear a noise from upstairs. A small THUD. Jojo looks up.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - LATER
Jojo slowly makes his way down the upstairs hall, looking in
rooms. He moves towards his sister’s room. He takes a moment
before stepping into the room and wandering around. He looks at
a photo of INGA, she is beautiful. He smiles and puts it down,
and then...
BANG!
The door slams shut. Jojo stands. He turns to see the window is
open, the drapes blowing. He breathes a small sigh of relief,
sits on the bed. He examines an array of Inga’s things on the
dresser in front of him, RIBBONS, DRAWINGS, PINS and MINIATURES.
He then inspects himself in the DRESSER MIRROR. He doesn’t like
his face. THEN, in the background of the reflection, he notices
the opposite wall.
Jojo is at the wall now, it is bare. On the ground sits a
picture in a frame. He picks it up and is about to re-hang it
when HE SEES IT. The wall is scratched, there is a thin cut in
the wallpaper that measures from his shoulder to the ground.
He traces the line of the cut and sees that it moves at right
angles. It is a DOOR. The hook it would hang on is also used as
a handle to pull the door open.
Jojo takes his trusty DJ KNIFE and pries the door out a little,
at the same time holding the hook and pulling the door OPEN. The
light from the opposite window doesn’t illuminate everything but
it does cast a wide beam into the darkness. As Jojo’s eyes
momentarily adjust he begins making out objects. At first it’s
only BOOKS.

26.
JOJO
Mama, the bad books. It’s not allowed.
Then he sees a candle, bedding, a plate, a fork, and then a
PALE, LONG HAIRED CREATURE hunched in the corner, its face
partially hidden beneath dishevelled long black hair, its dark
eyes staring back at him.
Jojo jumps at the sight and backs away, tripping on the rug and
stumbling to the opposite wall which he bumps into DROPPING HIS
KNIFE on the ground.
He stays still, frozen in fear, watching. He can only see the
darkness of the secret rooms interior now, that thing is around
the corner, hidden from view. Footsteps. Slowly, with listless
energy and no real purpose, a pale skinny little girl emerges
from the darkness. This is ELSA KORR (15)
She stops at the doorway, and casually leans her thin arm,
against the frame. She wears a simple knee-length dress, brown
and dirty, and has bare feet.
ELSA
You come to kill me, little boy?
I...

JOJO

He can’t say anything. A pause, and then she giggles. It is cute
and disarming at the same time. There’s something attractive and
alluring about her.
Jojo can’t speak. LEAVING HIS KNIFE he scuffles out the door,
getting out as fast as he can, down the hall, down the stairs.
He stops in the bottom hall and turns, listening.
ELSA (O.S.)
Joooooo-jooooooo...
STOMP. STOMP. STOMP. Footsteps on the stairs get louder.
Eventually Elsa rounds the corner and sits on the top stair,
they have distance between them.
JOJO
Who are you? What do you want? Are you
a ghost?
ELSA
(smiling, spooking him)
Yesssssssssss... a ghost.
She splays her arms out like a ghost.

27.
JOJO
Get out! Get out of my house!
ELSA
(normal)
Johannes, that’s no way to treat a
ghost.
JOJO
Why do you live upstairs in the wall?!
ELSA
Where else should a ghost live?
Not here!

JOJO

He runs towards the front door but is too slow. Elsa jumps from
her position and bounding like a cat she reaches him as he gets
to the front door. She grabs him by the scruff of the neck and
slams him into the wall, breathing heavily from the effort.
ELSA
Don’t make me run kid, I’m far too
hungry and y’know how much we have a
taste for your blood.
Jojo is petrified, breathing heavily too. She gets in close,
reveals his DJ Knife. She holds it to his face.
ELSA (CONT’D)
You dropped something.
(then)
I’m not a ghost Johannes, I’m
something worse. But I think you
already know that, don’t you? You know
what I am.
No.

JOJO

ELSA
Yes... Say it.

Jew.

JOJO
(he gulps, futile)

ELSA
(her smile drops)
Wunderbar.
JOJO
You can’t be here.

28.
ELSA
Well your mother invited me so I’m her
guest.
JOJO
No. It’s not allowed.
ELSA
What will you do sweet Hitlerchen?
Silence. Jojo’s eyes dart towards the door, and then the
telephone.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Of course. Go on then, go and tell
them. But you know what happens if you
do? I’ll say you helped me, and your
mother too. Then we’ll all be kaput.
And if you tell your mother you know
about me... just one word...
(raising the knife to his
neck)
I’ll do the world a great big favour
and CUT YOUR NAZI HEAD OFF. Got it?
She releases him and backs away still holding the knife.
ELSA (CONT’D)
I think I’ll hold onto this. It’s
pretty.
She wanders back up the stairs leaving Jojo absolutely stunned.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo sits on his bed, petrified.
ADOLF (O.S.)
Sheesh, that was intense.
Hitler is sitting next to him.
JOJO
Adolf, what am I gonna do??
ADOLF
Honestly, NO idea. You’re definitely
in a pickle. How the hell did she get
control like that?
JOJO
She used her Jew powers I guess. Mind
control.

29.
ADOLF
Is that a real thing?
Jojo nods.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
I really should know about that.
Jojo nods again.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Did you see how fast she moved? And
now she’s got that fancy knife.
JOJO
I know, I know! My knife! Okay, we
have to think.
Adolf lights a smoke, offers one to Jojo. He waves it away.
Hitler looks worried as he takes a drag.
ADOLF
I’ve got it. Burn down the house.
You think?

JOJO

ADOLF
It’s the only way.
JOJO
I might get in trouble.
ADOLF
Good point.
(snaps his fingers)
Got it. Burn the house down, blame it
on Winston Churchill.
JOJO
No, I can’t do that. This is MY family
home. I think I have to negotiate.
ADOLF
Even better! That’s the spirit.
Negotiate. Ooh, ooh, and remember,
don’t mention the war.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
From Inga’s room we see an empty hallway. We hear clattering and
the slow clunking sound of footsteps getting closer.

30.
Jojo comes into view wearing various household objects as
ARMOUR; A CHEESE-GRATER protects his forearm and a CAST-IRON POT
sits on his head. In one hand he now holds a KITCHEN KNIFE. He
is tip-toeing yet his get-up is making a huge racket.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo stands in his sister’s empty room. He speaks to the wall
Elsa lives behind.
JOJO
Excuse me? Hello? Little girl? Um, Jew
girl in the wall?
(beat)
Yoohoo, Jew?
Silence.
JOJO (CONT’D)
Ok well, I’ll just say what I have to
say.
(beat)
I don’t think it’s very convenient for
you to be in my house and I’m not
happy that my mother let you stay
here. I’m sure she has her reasons but
it really can’t go on.
(beat)
Now, I’m aware you have my knife. I
can’t say I’m comfortable with that
because it’s a Nazi knife and you’re
obviously... Anyway, I just want you
to know I’m not scared of you and I
think you should find somewhere else
to live. You have until tomorrow to
leave, then everyone will be happy.
(beat)
Ok?
From behind, in his ear...
Not okay.

ELSA (O.S.)

Jojo spins to see Elsa standing directly behind him, holding his
knife, a wry smile on her face. Jojo SQUEALS and stumbles back
in fright, collapsing to the floor, his armour crashing around
him. He drops the KITCHEN KNIFE as he scurries out of the room.
Arrgh!!!

JOJO

31.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - DAY
Back in his bedroom, the door firmly shut.
ADOLF
Great, now she’s got TWO knives!
I know!

JOJO

ADOLF
How are you going to chop up stuff?!
JOJO
I don’t know!
ADOLF
And she’s still up there!
JOJO
You’re the expert, you think of
something!
Hitler lights another cigarette, offers it to Jojo.
JOJO (CONT’D)
I don’t smoke! Stop offering me
fucking cigarettes! I’m TEN!
ADOLF
Sorry, sorry, this is stressful.
They start pacing, thinking, pacing, thinking... Hitler produces
a CAN OF GASOLINE and some MATCHES. Jojo waves it away. They
pace and think some more... As Jojo paces back he turns to see
Hitler has made a giant MOUSETRAP CONTRAPTION. He gestures “What
about this?” Jojo shrugs, “Maybe”... and paces some more.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Okay, let’s talk like turkeys. I guess
you can’t tell your mother or the Jew
will cut off your Nazi head. No real
way around that right now. But y’know,
there’s no reason this thing in the
attic needs to ruin your life. I think
you could use it to your advantage.
How?

JOJO

ADOLF
Well, when someone tries to use mindpowers on me, you know what I do?
(MORE)

32.
ADOLF (CONT'D)
(beat)
Use mind powers back on them.
Jojo perks up.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Remember last year when that pirate,
Von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up
with a bomb?
JOJO
Yeah, but you survived.
ADOLF
Correct-a-mundo. But the only reason I
survived, apart from having bomb-proof
legs, is because I outwitted old Von
Stauffy. I let him think I was dead
when in actual fact I was fine. By
pretending I was dead I drew out all
the traitors. So, what are you going
to do?
JOJO
Pretend I’m dead?
ADOLF
Exactly. Wait. No. I think what I mean
is this: Make her feel safe and she
will drop her guard and then you will
be the one in control.
JOJO
Is that “Reverse Psychology”?
ADOLF
Umm, I don’t think so. Let’s not
complicate things. Stick with my idea use mind-powers back on her - and
you’ll be fine.
(checks his watch)
I gotta go. Good luck and remember the
old saying: a Jew living in your wall
is better than a two Jews flying
around eating innocent Nazis.
He climbs out the window.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
And don’t give her any more KNIVES!
He winks and is gone. Out on Jojo’s worried face.

33.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Jojo sits in the living room, a look of utter fear and confusion
covers his face. The house is silent save for the ticking of a
clock.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
Jojo stands in the kitchen holding a piece of bread in his hand,
still staring into space. A tap drips to the same rhythm of the
clock.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - EVENING
Jojo waits on the steps of his house. The sound of dripping is
replaced by a man walking down the street in hard shoes. Across
the road a neighbour peers through their curtain.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRAU BETLZER’S ROOM - EVENING
Jojo sits in his mother’s room on the bed. The house is silent
save for the ticking of Jojo’s watch.
We hear a car pull up, the door close, footsteps. Frau Betzler
enters the house. Jojo runs to meet her...
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
He meets his mother at the front door.
Mama!

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Darling, darling, why are you still
up? Did you eat?
JOJO
It’s 10 o’clock. Where have you been?!
FRAU BETZLER
Oh cub, I was just taking a long walk
and having a think. I lost track of
time.
JOJO
Mama you should be careful. They frown
upon those who display sneaky
behaviour.

34.
FRAU BETZLER
Sneaky?! You goose. I promise things
will be back to normal soon. Trust me.
How was the Hitlerjugend? Did you get
some helpful work done today?
JOJO
Yes. Mama, I need to have a grown-up
conversation with you.
(under his breath)
And what did you achieve?
No answer, Frau Betzler notices one of Jojo’s laces are untied
again.
FRAU BETZLER
(crouching to tie them)
Oh, your laces, you really must-JOJO
I heard the her.
FRAU BETZLER
(jumping)
What?
Jojo keeps watching, trying to work her out.
JOJO
(staring at his mother)
Inga. Her ghost is here.
FRAU BETZLER
(laughing)
Oh for Heaven’s sake what are you
talking about?
Noises.

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Oh come on. You mean the RATS?! We
have rats in the attic and yes, I’ve
heard them too. Honestly, ghosts?!
Actually, I’ve been meaning to say;
you probably shouldn’t go up there
till I’ve caught them all, they have
diseases and I don’t need you getting
sick. Okay?
(beat)
Okay?
Jojo nods.

35.

Okay mama.

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Now, I left my gloves in a dream,
could you be a darling and go get them
for me?
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Frau Betzler tucks Jojo into bed.
JOJO
Mama, do you miss papa?
FRAU BETZLER
Like the sun misses the moon.
JOJO
And you miss Inga.
FRAU BETZLER
Like the moon misses the sun.
JOJO
Are you going to bed now?
FRAU BETZLER
Of course. I need to tidy up some
things before bed.
JOJO
What things?
FRAU BETZLER
Mama things. Boy, you really have to
trust me, I’m the boss here.
A beautiful smile appears across her face, she WINKS. Jojo can’t
help a tiny smirk, he tries a return wink but can’t.
Like this.

FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)

She demonstrates and winks again, Jojo attempts a return wink
but isn’t getting it.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
Yeah, but with just one eye. You can
do it.

36.
They continue this hopeful exchange a few more times. She
eventually places a finger over one of his eyes. He blinks his
other eye.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
There you go! You got it! Now go get
my gloves, will ya? I left them by a
rainbow.
She kisses him good-night and turns out the light.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT
Jojo lies in bed, wide awake. We hear a door creak open and
footsteps heading down the hall.
Leaving the safety of his room, Jojo creeps along the hall and
sees candle-light coming from the kitchen. He peers round the
corner and sees a glimpse of his mother’s nightgown as she
prepares something on a plate and disappears around the corner,
tiptoeing upstairs. Jojo follows...
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
Jojo reaches the top of the stairs in time to see his mother
entering his sister’s room. He stealthily makes his way to the
doorway and sees his mother knocks twice, lightly on a wall,
before removing a panel in the wall, pulling it out towards her.
She whispers something into the darkness of the SECRET ROOM. She
holds out the plate of food and a glass of water. Jojo’s eyes
widen and he trembles with fear as Elsa’s bony white arm extends
from the darkness, her spidery hand opening up and taking the
food. His mother whispers something else and then strokes the
arm, almost like a pet. Jojo steps back into the hall, backing
further away from what he has just seen.
JOJO
(whispering)
Mama what are you doing?? It’s not
allowed...
INT. REHABILITATION CENTRE - DAY
Jojo swims in a pool with various other wounded men. Jojo is
helped by an older woman, HELGA. She stretches his arms.
HELGA
Yes, stretch, you must stretch. Now
squeeze my hand. Squeeze!

37.
A man swims past. He has no arms. Another man has no limbs,
another no face at all.
Hitler swims by wearing a bathing cap, He is looking around at
all the disabled people. He turns back to Jojo, an expression on
his face that says: “How gross are these freaks??” Jojo is
carried away by Helga to the other side of the pool.
INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - DAY
Jojo collects the small pile of CONSCRIPTIONS for the day and
approaches Herr Klenzendorf’s office. He enters and we find
Klenzendorf drawing pictures of FANTASY GUNS. Finkel sits at a
smaller table playing with PINK TRIANGLE PATCHES. He holds them
together like a sash and holds them across his chest, smiling at
his pink fashion creation.
JOJO
Excuse me, Herr Klenzendorf.
Finkel drops the pink patches.
KLENZENDORF
(showing his drawing)
Ahh, Jojo. What do you think of this?
It’s a type of Gatling Gun. It is also
mounted with a radio which emits
annoying music to deflect the enemy. I
was thinking Pachelbel would be good.
JOJO
Do you do any actual real work?
KLENZENDORF
Nope. However, now and then I help out
the Grey Goons.
Who?

JOJO

KLENZENDORF
Gestapo. They are low on numbers so
sometimes they make me help them with
their investigations.
JOJO
Ah, that must be exciting, solving
crimes and finding people.
KLENZENDORF
Honestly, they couldn’t find arse in a
shit factory, but if you’re looking
for someone they’re your best bet.
(MORE)

38.
KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)
It’s actually quite boring but at
least I get out of this office and
away from the children. My true place
is at the front. I’m a soldier, not a
baby-sitter.
Jojo sits, time for business.
JOJO
Can I ask you about Jews?
KLENZENDORF
Oh God, why?
JOJO
I’m curious. What happens if I see
one?
KLENZENDORF
Hide the end of your penis!
He collapses into laughter. Finkel joins in, wobbling on his
seat like a giggling jello. Klenzendorf encourages him by miming
a CIRCUMCISION.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
Ha haha, oh boy, I needed that.
FINKEL
Oh yes, me too Captain K. I really
needed to laugh.
KLENZENDORF
Ok, so in reality if you see a Jew you
tell us and then we tell the Gestapo
and they tell the SS and then they go
and kill the Jew. And anyone who
helped the Jew. And, because these are
very paranoid times, probably some
other people just in case. It’s very
convoluted.
Jojo gulps.
JOJO
Even if the Jew hypnotised someone to
make them hide the Jew in the first
place?
KLENZENDORF
Err, yep. Though I’d be amazed if that
could happen. Did you see one?

39.
JOJO
Nope. I wouldn’t be able to tell even
if I did.
KLENZENDORF
Me neither. Without their funny hats
it’s damn near impossible. Someone
should write a book on the subject.
This sparks an idea.
JOJO
I have to go deliver these
conscriptions.
KLENZENDORF
Yes, good man. And watch your willy
out there.
He mimes a pair of scissors ‘SNIP SNIP’ and collapses into a fit
of laughter again, joined by the over-exuberant Finkel.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Jojo stands in his sister’s room, while Elsa sits in the doorway
to her hideout. She still has the knife and digs it into the
floor.
JOJO
Ok here’s the situation. If I tell on
you, you’ll be in big trouble and I
don’t think you want that. But then
you’ll tell on me and my mother, which
I don’t want. And if you tell my
mother I know, then she’ll kick you
out which you don’t want. And if I
tell my mother I know, then you’ll cut
off my head, which I don’t want.
ELSA
A stalemate.
JOJO
Indeed. So, we must make a compromise.
I have thought deeply about this and I
now conclude that it’s better to have
you locked up in the house rather than
letting you run around town causing
Jewish havoc.
I see.

ELSA

40.
JOJO
However, I have some conditions for
allowing you to stay here in my house.
ELSA
Conditions?
JOJO
Yes. I will not cause any trouble for
you if you promise to tell me
everything about the Jewish race.
ELSA
Ok. We’re like you but human. Done.
JOJO
Please take this seriously. I want to
know all your secrets, how you shapeshift, what you eat, how to tell a Jew
from a real person and, where you
build your hives. Think of it as an
exposé.
An exposé.

ELSA

JOJO
On Jews, yes. I will deliver my
findings to the authorities and
hopefully get a medal or promotion of
some sort.
Wow.

ELSA

JOJO
What? I think that’s quite reasonable.
ELSA
You’re a little bit of an idiot aren’t
you? Why do you want this?
JOJO
Because I’m interested, that’s all.
ELSA
There are already Jew hunters.
Elsa stands and enters Inga’s room. Jojo keeps his distance.
JOJO
Well they’re not doing their best are
they? You’ve been here at least a
month.

41.
ELSA
Three to be exact.
Three?!

JOJO

ELSA
You were asleep for two of them.
Elsa sits on Inga’s bed.
JOJO
Kindly refrain from sitting on my
sister’s bed.
ELSA
Why? She doesn’t need it.
JOJO
You know nothing of my sister.
ELSA
You don’t remember me do you?
(beat)
Inga and I were friends. I took violin
lessons with her when we were 10. We
practiced in this very room, sat on
this very bed. I was sad to hear of
her passing.
JOJO
You are not to talk of her.
ELSA
I remember you too. Such a funny
little boy, always trying to get in
here and play. Who knew you’d grow
into such a little... Nazi.
JOJO
Enough with the small talk. Start
telling me about your kind. I’m
interested especially in how you can
turn into animals and what your real
skin looks like.
(beat)
And the horns please.
Elsa stands. She walks to the window, peeks out.
ELSA
The neighbours are suspicious. They
always watch the house.

42.
JOJO
Then get away from the window.
ELSA
The world is paranoid isn’t it?
Everyone watching each other,
informing on each other.
JOJO
You’re really not telling me anything
useful. Now, there are some things I
already know, like the fact that you Jews - love ugliness. You don’t like
pretty things like... flowers or
butterflies.
ELSA
Where did you hear that?
School.

JOJO

ELSA
You like butterflies?
JOJO
They’re okay. I’m more into guns. What
do you like?
Elsa laughs and moves away from the window.
ELSA
Ok. We are demons who love money,
that’s clear right?
Of course.

JOJO

ELSA
But what people don’t know is that we
are also allergic to food.
What?

JOJO

ELSA
Cheese, bread and sausages. Those
things will kill us instantly. So...
if you’re thinking of ending my life,
feeding me those things is the
quickest way. And Cake. Lethal.
Jojo is puzzled. Finally gets it.

43.
JOJO
Very funny.
ELSA
I’m going back in my cave, the
sunlight weakens me.
Jojo writes that information down. She goes into her hideout and
closes the door behind her. Jojo sits there, not sure what else
to say.
JOJO
(loudly)
Ok, that’s enough for today. We’ll
continue tomorrow.
(beat)
Okay?
ELSA (O.S.)
(From the wall)
Piss off.
Jojo packs his book away and leaves.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - EVENING
Jojo waits patiently in the living room.
ADOLF (O.S.)
She’s pretty rude, y’know.
Jojo turns to see Adolf, standing in the doorway dressed as a
Native American, complete with leather tunic and feather headdress. He also smokes a long peace-pipe which he offers to Jojo.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
That’s just my 2 pfennige.
JOJO
She doesn’t want to talk to me. This
book is going to be harder to write
than I thought.
ADOLF
Do you want to play Cowboys and
Indians? It might help take your mind
off the whole secret Jewish girl in
the attic thing.
Suddenly we hear the front door open and Frau Betzler bursting
in, flustered. She closes the door loudly and in a loud voice:

44.
FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)
Hallo house! I’m home!
Hitler scurries around the room in a panic looking for somewhere
to hide and finding nothing, hugs the wall. He closes his eyes
tightly and holds his breath.
JOJO
(whispering)
She can’t see you.
ADOLF
(whispering)
I know. Especially not now that I’m
blending in to my surroundings.
We pull back to reveal Hitler, still dressed as an American
Indian, frozen in a pose that doesn’t blend in to his
surroundings.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
(whispering)
It also helps if I can’t see her.
He closes his eyes tightly. Frau Betzler enters.
FRAU BETZLER
Hello my darling!
She quickly scoots to the window and looks out to the street,
muttering to herself.
JOJO
Where have you been? It’s 6 o’clock
and I’ve had a hell of a day.
FRAU BETZLER
Sorry, my love. I was at the library.
JOJO
We can’t eat books!
FRAU BETZLER
How do you know? Have you even tried?
Don’t limit yourself, kid.
(laughing)
Come now Jojo. I’m still a mama Lion
you know. And mama Lions are the best
hunters in the pride...
She reveals a 1/2 LOAF OF BREAD, some CHEESE and a small bag of
VEGETABLES.

45.
JOJO
Where did you get that?
FRAU BETZLER
Who’s asking?
JOJO
Me. Where is it from?
FRAU BETZLER
God, What are you, the Food Gestapo?
Sheesh kid, give a girl a break. These
are tough times and I got us food; end
of discussion!
JOJO
Who was out the window?
FRAU BETZLER
Himmler. He’s cleaning the yard and
I’m making sure he doesn’t slack on
the job.
She laughs hysterically and moves off to the kitchen. Hitler
exhales and opens his eyes.
Phew.

ADOLF

Jojo goes to the window. Outside, a car drives slowly past the
house. It resumes a normal speed and disappears into the night.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Well, I guess Cowboys and Indians is
off the cards. I may as well go home
and have dinner too.
(then)
She lied by the way; your mother.
Himmler’s not out there.
Adolf leaves.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Jojo sits at the table while Frau Betzler places a large pot in
the middle of the table next to a loaf of bread. She ladles hot
stew into the plates and sighs contentedly.
JOJO
Why so cheerful?
FRAU BETZLER
Oh, I heard some good news that’s all.

46.

What news?

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Things are changing. The Allies have
nearly taken Italy. The war will soon
be over.
JOJO
God Dammit.
FRAU BETZLER
Jojo, language.
JOJO
The war will soon end but it will be
the Reich who stands tall and proud.
We will crush the Roast Beef
Englishmen like I am crushing this
piece of bread.
He tries to squeeze the bread but is too weak.
JOJO (CONT’D)
My strength hasn’t returned but you
get my point.
FRAU BETZLER
Ok! Can we just eat?!
(composes herself)
No more politics. The dinner table is
neutral ground, it’s Switzerland.
She breaks the bread for him.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
Would you like to say Grace?
JOJO
God in Heaven, please watch over our
beloved Germany, the great Third
Reich, and our father Adolf Hitler who
is the bestest, most wonderf-FRAU BETZLER
AMEN! Let’s eat.
She begins eating, Jojo fumes.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER
They are finishing their meals. Frau Betzler is clearing the
table.

47.
JOJO
Is papa really coming home?
Of course.

FRAU BETZLER

JOJO
What if he doesn’t?
FRAU BETZLER
What nonsense, of course he’s coming
home. And the whole family will be
together again.
Frau Betzler scrapes leftovers onto a plate. Jojo watches this.
JOJO
Except her.
Beat. She stops scraping. Jojo looks at her.
Who?
Inga.

FRAU BETZLER
JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
No. But of course she will be with
us... in our hearts.
JOJO
I miss her.
She smiles sadly and finishes clearing.
JOJO (CONT’D)
Maybe we should get rid of her stuff
and use the room for something else.
FRAU BETZLER
Hm. Yes, maybe when papa comes home he
can use it for a study.
Perhaps.

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Are you done? May I take your plate?
JOJO
No. I’m going to eat everything like a
good little boy. I’ll even eat your
leftovers if you don’t mind.

48.
He smiles and eats everything on his plate.
SFX: BOMBING RAID SIRENS...
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jojo sits in a chair opposite Elsa as BOMBS are dropped on the
city in the distance. They speak in hushed tones.
JOJO
Now, I want you to draw a picture of
where Jews live. A typical hive; where
you all sleep, eat and where the Queen
Jew lays the eggs.
ELSA
You really are an idiot.
Elsa takes his pen and paper and starts drawing.
JOJO
Tell me about your family.
ELSA
My father is a 3-headed space-dog and
my mother is a piglet who wears
clothes to blend in.
Jojo gives an exasperated look.
ELSA (CONT’D)
I’ll tell you about Jews but you are
not privileged to know about my
family.
JOJO
I need background.
ELSA
Ask them yourself.
JOJO
Where are they?
ELSA
(shrugging, pointing)
In the other wall. I think I heard
them chewing on diamonds.
JOJO
I don’t have time for this.

49.
ELSA
I do. I have all the time in the
world.
JOJO
I wouldn’t be sure of that.
ELSA
Let me ask you something. Why are you
hanging around with me? Don’t you have
any friends?
JOJO
Of course. Many
Who?
Yorki.

ELSA
JOJO

ELSA
“Yorki”. And...
Others.

JOJO

ELSA
Pff. You don’t have any friends.
JOJO
You don’t. You don’t have anyone.
ELSA
I have Nathan.
JOJO
Who the hell is that?
ELSA
My fiancée. I have him.
JOJO
A Jew too I suppose.
ELSA
Yes, and a very strong one.
JOJO
Where is he?
ELSA
Everywhere he is needed. He’s fighting
in the resistance. He’s eighteen.

50.
She holds out a LOCKET with TWO PHOTOS inside. One is a pretty
picture of Elsa, the other of a handsome young man, NATHAN.
JOJO
Eurgh, how ugly. You deserve each
other.
ELSA
Yes, we do.
She stares longingly at the photo. Jojo notices, he shifts
uncomfortably.
ELSA (CONT’D)
He proposed to me on the banks of the
Fluss. By Jaegerplatz. He knelt down
like a proper gentleman, recited a
poem by Rilke, and when I said ‘yes’
we danced down the street.
JOJO
Snore. Who’s Rilke?
ELSA
A great Poet, Austrian, Nathan’s
favourite.
JOJO
(childish)
Ooooooh, Naaaathan’s favourite. I
think you mean German by the way.
ELSA
Austrian. Anyway, shut up. Nathan’s
coming, he’ll rescue me and then we’ll
go live in Paris.
JOJO
Errr, News-Flash; we occupy Paris.
ELSA
Not for long. Your mother said it’s
about to fall.
JOJO
Oh God, what would she know??
ELSA
More than you think. You hear those
bombs? They are landing on your
precious Reich. It’s said that Germany
will fall within a year. Then I will
be free.
(MORE)

51.
ELSA (CONT'D)
I will leave this place and this town,
find Nathan, start a new life, and
never look back.
JOJO
You would turn your back on Germany
forever.
ELSA
She turned on me first.
JOJO
Yeah well we don’t need you. You and
your stupid boyfriend can shut up and
go live in dumb-French-land. Good
luck.
ELSA
Now, now, just because you don’t have
a girlfriend.
JOJO
Pah! Don’t need one. I’m too busy for
girls.
ELSA
One day you’ll make time.
He rolls his eyes.
ELSA (CONT’D)
You’ll think of nothing else. You’ll
meet a girl and spend your days
dreaming of the moment you can hold
her in your arms again. And she’ll
think the same of you. This is called
love.
Jojo takes a moment, under her spell. He breaks out of it.
JOJO
Okayyyyy.
(smiling, venomous)
Sorry there wasn’t enough food
tonight.
ELSA
Your mother managed to find some
bread. She is kind. She thought you
suspected something but I told her you
weren’t smart enough.
JOJO
I’m glad you’re so friendly with her.

52.
ELSA
She’s nice to me. She treats me like a
person.
JOJO
But you’re not. Not a proper person.
She looks him up and down.
Are you?

ELSA

JOJO
How dare you, Jew. You are weak
like... a weak eyelash. I am born of
Aryan ancestry, the strongest race on
Earth. My blood is the colour of a
pure red rose and my eyes are blue
like a sapphi-Suddenly Elsa has Jojo in a headlock, twisting his weak arm
behind him. He winces in pain.
JOJO (CONT’D)
Ow ow ow ow ow ow...
She covers his mouth, suffocating him.
JOJO (CONT’D)
(muffled, quiet)
Mmmph!
ELSA
Break free.
Mmrrmmph.

JOJO

ELSA
Break free, great Aryan.
(leaning in close)
There are no weak Jews. I am descended
from those who wrestle angels and kill
giants. We were chosen by God. You
were chosen by a fat man with greasy
hair and half a moustache.
His struggle is useless, he cannot break her grip. She releases
him and pushes him onto Inga’s bed.
ELSA (CONT’D)
The stronger race, huh?

53.
She tears off the paper and puts it down next to him. Jojo looks
at the picture. It is a drawing of him, it’s pretty good...
underneath she has written the word IDIOT.
JOJO
I said draw where Jews live. This is
just a stupid picture of my head.
She slinks back into her hideout -ELSA
That’s where we live.
-- and closes the wall behind her. Jojo stares at his drawing,
the distant bombing continues.
INT. GESTAPO OFFICE - DAY
Jojo enters the local GESTAPO OFFICE, a long line of people wait
to file reports and denounce other citizens. Jojo approaches a
SECRETARY who, upon seeing his face, cringes.
SECRETARY
(then, disinterested)
Are you denouncing a neighbour,
political traitor, or informing on
friends and family?
She places some forms in front of Jojo.
JOJO
I am looking for someone. I haven’t
seen them in a while. I was wondering
if you had any files on them.
SECRETARY
I’m obviously busy.
She’s obviously not.
SECRETARY (CONT’D)
Why don’t you go have a look back
there in the file room.
(calling)
Erwin!
She indicates an area filled with a HUGE MESS of files and
folders - paper piled high - complete disarray.
SECRETARY (CONT’D)
As you can see we’re understaffed and
inundated with files and reports.
(MORE)

54.
SECRETARY (CONT’D)
These days being an informant has
become a national pastime.
A large, pimply guy (20’s) named Erwin arrives.
SECRETARY (CONT’D)
Erwin, take him to the file-room.
(off Erwin’s silence)
Now!
Erwin grumbles something and beckons Jojo to follow him to the
file-room. An old local woman now approaches the desk.
SECRETARY (CONT’D)
Hello. Denouncing a neighbour,
political traitor, or informing on
friends and family?
Family.

OLD LADY

INT. GESTAPO OFFICE - FILE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo searches through a chaotically messy filing system as Erwin
scratches at something under his arm. Jojo flicks through folder
after folder. CLOSE on the folders flicking back one after the
other...
JOJO
Nathan Raame, Nathan Raaaaame, where
are you, stupid Nathan, poetry reading
dumbhead?
He sits back, NOTHING. Erwin scratches some more.
INT. TOWN - LIBRARY - DAY
Jojo walks down an aisle of the local library. He scans the
scant shelves and finds what he was looking for; RILKE: POEMS
AND ESSAYS. He pulls it out and secretly stuffs it into his
jacket. He turns around and sees Hitler stuffing his own jacket
with about 20 books. They spill out, onto the floor.
HITLER
Great thinking, Rabbit. We’ll use
these to make a fake floor that she
can fall through, straight into some
piranhas.
(beat)
Or hot lava-- no, piranhas is good.
(cackling sinisterly)
(MORE)

55.
HITLER (CONT'D)
She won’t know what hit her when she
starts getting chomped by those little
fishies!
EXT. TOWN - LIBRARY - DAY
As he leaves the library Jojo hums softly to himself. Slowly it
seems others are joining in his song. He looks around and the
sound gets louder. From around a corner, lead by FRAULEIN RAHM,
we see a group of “Jungvolk” marching and singing...
JUNGVOLK
We are marching for Hitler through
Night and Need, with the flag of the
youth, for freedom and bread.
(then)
We were born to die for Germany!
Jojo moves against the wall and watches them pass. It is
glorious - he catches the eye of a couple of the kids. They
smirk and look at him with contempt.
FRAULEIN RAHM
Come on everyone, one more time!
They keep singing as Jojo retreats into the shadows.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jojo busily writes a letter on his bed, the Rilke poetry book
lies next to him. Hitler lays on the bed next to him, reading a
book about CAMELS.
ADOLF
The humps are filled with water?!
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - LATER
Jojo and Hitler sit in darkness, listening. We hear footsteps
down the hall and then a door closing softly. Hitler makes a
military gesture to take action, Jojo moves out into the dark
hallway.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Jojo knocks on Elsa’s wall-door.
ELSA (O.S.)
I wonder who it could possibly be?

56.
JOJO
It’s Johannes Betzler. The little boy
who lives downstairs.
ELSA (O.S.)
I knowwwwww...
JOJO
Oh. Well, I have something to tell
you. I happened to be doing some
important filing today and I came
across an old letter from Nathan your fiancée - addressed to you. It’s
quite lucky I found it.
ELSA (O.S.)
What the hell are you talking about?
JOJO
I have a letter from Nathan. Shall I
read it to you?
Pause. Elsa opens the door a little. We see a piece of her face
in the thin beam of light. Jojo unfolds a piece of paper - we
can see that the writing is not that of a 17 year-old but that
of a 10 year-old.
ELSA
Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say
but I don’t want to marry you anymore.
I found another woman and we laugh and
have good talks. I’m sure there’s
better people for you anyway. It’s
like my favourite poet Rilke says:
“We need, in love, to practice only
this: letting each other go.”
So goodbye and sorry about dumping
you. From Nathan your ex-fiancée.
PS. I am not really in the resistance
I was lying. I am unemployed.
Elsa retreats into her room and we hear her begin to cry.
JOJO
Oh. Why are you doing that?
ELSA
Please leave.
Jojo shuffles out of the room as Elsa continues to cry.

57.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - LATER
Jojo is back. He knocks lightly on Elsa’s wall.
Hi.

JOJO

He knocks lightly again.
JOJO (CONT’D)
Are you still alive?
Barely.

ELSA (O.S.)

JOJO
Oh, well that’s good. Um, don’t open
the door because it’s risky today. So
I actually forgot there was a second
letter. I forgot I had it. I’ll just
read it.
(reading)
Dear Elsa. I just wanted to say that I
don’t want to break up with you now. I
changed my mind because I don’t want
you to kill yourself over me which a
couple of girls have done in the past
and it gives me nightmares.
(beat)
So, let’s still get married sometime even though I truly am unemployed and
have nothing much going for me. I
don’t even know how to tie a knot or
read a map. Yours, Nathan.
(then)
No X’s or O’s I’m afraid but it still
seems pretty positive.
A beat. Elsa’s door opens to reveal her sitting, staring at
Jojo, a peaceful look on her face. This Jojo kid’s a character.
He gives a tiny smile.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - LATER
CLOSE UP on Jojo, mid-discussion with Elsa.
Beethoven.
Einstein.

JOJO
ELSA

58.

Bach.
Gerschwin.
Brahms.
Mozart.
Wagner.

JOJO
ELSA
JOJO

ELSA
All musicians, is that all you have?!
JOJO
(laughs)
Freud then.
ELSA
Ha! You dare take Freud?!
(waving a finger)
No, no, no, never. He’s ours.
JOJO
(laughing)
He’s German!
ELSA
(laughs)
No Freud for you! Or Proust.
Rilke.

JOJO

ELSA
Oh of course, your favourite, Rilke.
Jewish mother.
JOJO
Well no one takes Goethe.
ELSA
Keep him, we have Kafka.
Durer.

JOJO

ELSA
Pah... Chagall shits on Durer. A big
Russian shit on your boring Durer.
They laugh some more.

59.
JOJO
Marlene Dietrich, then.
ELSA
(smiling, clicking her
fingers)
Houdini.
JOJO
Nooooo... impossible.
ELSA
Believe it brother. Just ask Pissaro,
Modigliani, Max Jacob, Man Ray,
Henschel, Nimzowitsch, Gertrude Stein,
Mr. Moses and Jesus Christi, Amen.
JOJO
You’re just saying any old name now.
I’ve never heard of these people and
now I’m fed up.
He stands and leaves the room. We stay with Elsa, after a
while...
Night.

ELSA

EXT. FOOD RATION STORE - DAY
Frau Betzler stands in line to receive her food allowance. She
hands three RATION CARDS to the STOREMAN.
STOREMAN
Three? I remember you only used two in
the past.
FRAU BETZLER
Ah, yes, but I have developed a more
efficient system. I now use 3 ration
cards, taking enough for 2 to eat, but
then we take twice as long to eat it,
you see? 3 for 2, which makes 6. But
here’s where it gets interesting; you
take the original number times it by
3, carry the 7, subtract 2, then add 2
again (because secretly you need the
2), then divide the whole thing by the
potatoes.
(smiling)
Simple, no?

60.
The Storeman looks puzzled and a couple of other people in line
watch the exchange suspiciously. Jojo helps his mother with the
shopping and they leave.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
Excuse me, look out, German coming
through.
EXT. TOWN - RIVER - EVENING
Jojo and his mother sit with some locals on the banks of the
river as a small, pathetic parade of RETURNED SOLDIERS go by.
Frau Betzler looks to the sky.
FRAU BETZLER
Once there were fireworks. To
celebrate them coming home. Now the
sky is empty.
Jojo sees GUDRUN, the girl from Hitlerjugend camp. They make eye
contact, he smiles but her face turns away in disgust.
FRAU BETZLER (CONT’D)
At least it’s still romantic down here
at the Fluss. There used to be lovers
walking these banks, dancing. But
now...
JOJO
Mama, there is no time for romance, we
are at war.
FRAU BETZLER
There is always time for romance Jojo.
One day you will meet someone special.
JOJO
Why does everyone keep telling me
that?
FRAU BETZLER
Who else tells you?
JOJO
Everyone. Anyway, it’s a stupid idea.
FRAU BETZLER
Love isn’t stupid, cub. It’s the
strongest thing in the world.

61.
JOJO
I think you’ll find that metal is the
strongest thing in the world, followed
closely by dynamite and then muscles
in third place.
(beat)
Besides, I wouldn’t even know it if I
saw it.
Love?

FRAU BETZLER

JOJO
Yes, that. I suppose it smells like
flowers or soap.
FRAU BETZLER
(looking down)
Oh surprise, surprise, your shoelaces
undone. Again.
(putting on a voice)
“I’m Jojo and I don’t know how to tie
my shoelaces even though I’m 10”.
(she ties his laces)
No Jojo. Love has no smell. It has no
shape and it has no sound.
JOJO
Well then how would anyone know? It
can’t exist.
FRAU BETZLER
You’ll know it when it happens. You’ll
feel it.
JOJO
Like a pain in my arse I bet.
FRAU BETZLER
Nope, in your tummy. Like butterflies.
And your heart. It’s like you’re full
of butterflies.
JOJO
Butterflies huh? Yuck.
FRAU BETZLER
Yeah, yuck. Come on Shitler, let’s get
a move on.
She stands. Jojo gets to his feet but trips. His shoelaces are
tied together.

62.

Wha??

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
Haha! Come on kid, get your act
together, don’t you know how to walk
properly?
She helps him to his feet and pushes him along, he falls again,
laughing.
JOJO
Mama, stop it!
FRAU BETZLER
What’s wrong Jojo? Get it together,
man. I’m worried about you, are you
drunk?
(to a passer-by)
Excuse me, can you help? My child is
drunk.
JOJO
(laughing)
Don’t believe her!
FRAU BETZLER
(another silly voice)
“I’m Jojo and I shouldn’t trust pretty
ladies to tie my shoelaces...”
He gets up and tries to chase her. They play like this, him
tripping over, trying to catch his mother, as locals watch.
EXT. TOWN - STREET - LATER
His shoelaces now properly tied, Jojo and his mother continue
walking. Frau Betzler notices other children staring, laughing
and pointing at Jojo behind his back. She turns and gives them a
ghostly ‘BOO!’ They scatter in fright. Jojo smiles but is
embarrassed.
Hey Jojo?

FRAU BETZLER

JOJO
Yes, Rosie?
FRAU BETZLER
Promise me one thing will you? When
this is all over and the world is
normal again, try to be a normal kid
again?

63.
JOJO
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
FRAU BETZLER
You’re growing up too fast. A ten year
old shouldn’t be celebrating war or
talking politics. You should be having
fun, climbing trees and then falling
out of those trees.
JOJO
But I must love war. Our father says
when we win, it is us young boys who
will rule the world.
FRAU BETZLER
The Reich is dying. There will be
nothing to rule. Your beloved angry
man is losing. And you already have a
father.
JOJO
And where is he? Winning the war?
FRAU BETZLER
He is more of a man than any of your
heroes... Oh Gott...
She stops suddenly. PAINTED in WHITE across their front door we
see:
O 5
Jojo is puzzled. Frau Betzler gasps. Some neighbours are
watching from their windows.
JOJO
Huh? That’s not our address.
FRAU BETZLER
(to the neighbours)
Fascinating isn’t it?! Oh so
interesting!
The neighbours close the curtains as she storms inside.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER
Jojo and his mother scrub the door with brushes and water. The
paint is slow to come off.

64.
JOJO
What does it mean, mama?
FRAU BETZLER
Oh, pff, nothing darling. Those damned
neighbourhood kids playing pranks!
It’s probably some sort of funny joke!
O-5...?

JOJO

FRAU BETZLER
It’s probably their age. Ha!
She laughs and continues to scrub.
JOJO
It’s probably their I.Q.
FRAU BETZLER
Exactly! O5! So funny, I love it!
Jojo watches her scrub, as do the neighbours. She looks back and
WINKS at Jojo.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ELSA’S HIDEOUT - NIGHT
Jojo sits on Inga’s bed, lost in thought. Elsa sits nearby. Jojo
sighs.
ELSA
What’s wrong?
JOJO
I’m just distracted. There’s a gang of
5 year-old vandals running around the
neighbourhood.
ELSA
I heard people near the house earlier.
JOJO
That’s them. Degenerate toddlers
harassing innocent people. I’m worried
about my mother.
He takes a seat.
JOJO (CONT’D)
No news from Nathan today I’m afraid.
He’s probably doing something amazing
like blowing up trains or growing a
moustache.

65.
She smiles at this.
ELSA
You want me to tell you about the
Jews?
Jojo looks at her. Really?
ELSA (CONT’D)
Get comfortable.
(she takes a breath)
In the beginning we used to live in
caves, deep, deep in the centre of the
Earth.
Wait.

JOJO

Jojo takes a pen and starts writing furiously in his book.
ELSA
Scary places full of strange and
wonderful creatures all with one thing
in common...
JOJO
(nodding, knowingly)
Stealing the ends of penises.
ELSA
(laughing)
No you idiot. A love of art and
poetry.
JOJO
No cutting penises off?
ELSA
You want the story or not?
JOJO
You may continue. But I know it’s
true, the penis thing. Rabbis use them
for earplugs.
ELSA
Aaaand moving on. So, after many years
of developing magic and spells, we
slowly moved out of the caves and into
the towns. Some of us stayed in the
caves and stayed in our normal bodies.
JOJO
Which are... blobs or something?

66.
ELSA
Well, I’ll draw them for you.
She takes Jojo’s book and starts drawing. Jojo watches her
elegant hands as they create the picture. She hands the book
back to Jojo; it is a beautiful sketch of a WEIRD creature that
is more like an ELF or FAIRY. Definitely not Jewish or a
monster.
ELSA (CONT’D)
It would be better with colour but all
I have is this blunt pencil.
JOJO
Where’s the horns?
ELSA
Um, they’re under the hair.
JOJO
Where are yours?
ELSA
I’m too young. They grow when you turn
21.
JOJO
(of course!)
Ahhh...
He writes that down too.
ELSA
Anyway, these days we live among
normal humans but often we will take
over a house and hang from the ceiling
when we sleep, like bats. Oh, one
interesting thing is that we can read
each others’ minds.
JOJO
Everyone’s minds? What about German
minds?
ELSA
No, they are too thick for us to
penetrate. We can only read Jewish
thoughts.
JOJO
So you’re weaker when you’re separated
from your hive...

67.

Exactly.

ELSA

JOJO
Oh my God, this is so good. So what
are your other weaknesses?
ELSA
Well, although we used to be able to
fly unfortunately we can’t anymore otherwise I’d be long gone.
Of course.

JOJO

ELSA
Our wings got burnt off after that
whole Jesus debacle. Punishment from
God.
JOJO
Makes sense.
ELSA
Oh, and we are attracted to shiny
things, like birds. That is why we
came to the beautiful cities of
Germany, all the glass and gold and
crystals.
JOJO
(writing)
Attracted to shiny things... but also
ugly things, Jews love ugliness.
That’s another thing we learned in
school.
(beat)
Ugly things yes? You love them?
Elsa regards this 10 year-old kid writing as fast as he can, a
manic look on his face. A small smile creeps across hers.
ELSA
No, not ugly things, exotic things.
JOJO
(ignoring her, writing)
Hmm yes, they love ugly things.
He pauses, catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror on the other
side of the room. We see his scarred face. He registers his
“ugliness” and goes back to writing.

68.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo enters his room with a pep in his step..
Ahem...

VOICE (O.S.)

Jojo turns to see Adolf Hitler sitting in his bed.
JOJO
Wha-- Hey, that’s my bed.
ADOLF
You two seem to be getting on well.
Who?

JOJO

ADOLF
You and old Jew face.
JOJO
No, I just...
ADOLF
(mocking)
I was jus-- I was jus-JOJO
I was making sure she was still alive.
ADOLF
What do you care?
JOJO
I don’t. But I also don’t want a dead
person in my house. How would you like
it?
ADOLF
(wiggling his toes)
I wouldn’t care. I’m tough. Look, I
want to believe you but part of me
doesn’t. Whatever that feeling is
called. That and all the time you guys
are spending together... I have to
admit, it makes me uncomfortable.
JOJO
Well, you suggested it in the first
place. Besides, it’s for the book.

69.
ADOLF
Okay, sorry. You’re right. Oh no, I’ve
made it weird between us, haven’t I?
Is it weird? Oh god, it’s weird now.
A moment as we take in Hitler in Jojo’s bed. Weird.
JOJO
It’s fine, look I’m just tired. I need
to go to bed.
ADOLF
Sure, I was just keeping it warm for
you.
He gets out of bed, dressed in full regalia, including those
PUFFY-HIPPED PANTS that WW2 Generals wear.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Hey do you think this uniform is
slimming? I’m not sure about the hips
on the pants. I’ve seen them on other
people and honestly, they make the
thighs look absolutely HUGE.
JOJO
You look great. As usual.
ADOLF
What about the moustache? I’m thinking
about losing it. It seemed like a
great idea at first but now I’m not
sure. It’s always there, like a little
black worm. Whenever I look at my face
I just see this stupid thing crawling
on my lip.
JOJO
Well, it’s kind of your trademark now.
ADOLF
(feeling his moustache)
You’re right. I guess I’ll keep it.
Thanks, I can always count on you to
make me feel better. You’re like an
honest and reliable son to me.
JOJO
And you’re like a fashionable dad.
Throughout this very short monologue, Adolf Hitler builds in
energy, resembling for the first time, the intense yet
charismatic Hitler we know from the famous speeches.

70.
ADOLF
Be careful Jojo, and remember this
good advice from me. Once you see
what's in her mind and where she's
trying to get you to go - in your own
head, you must go the other way. Don’t
let her put you in a brain prison! You
must be strong, you must always be
alert and ready for anything. She's
dangerous and cunning like an
unpredictable baby opossum. Before you
know it, you’ve got that thing
clinging to your face, and that, dear
Jojo, is one thing that does cannot
happen to a German! Do not let her
boss your German brain around!
He has worked himself up into quite a frenzy. Jojo stares at him
with love and admiration.
JOJO
I won’t let my brain be bossed around
by her, mein Führer.
ADOLF
Try not to. Bossing around people’s
brains is extremely rude and uncalled
for. It looks like you’ve got a lot of
good information so far. Now to share
it with others, yes?
Jojo nods. Hitler goes to leave.
JOJO
Um Adolf, do you think I’m... ugly?
ADOLF
Is that a trick question?
(he ponders, then)
Is there another word for ugly but not
quite as offensive?
JOJO
I don’t think so.
ADOLF
Well if there was, that’d be you to a
tee. Anyway, ugly isn’t a bad thing.
Field Marshal Rommel was absolutely
hideous but he made up for it with
great joke telling abilities.
(then)
Sweet dreams, little Rabbit.

71.
He winks and leaps out the window. Jojo looks in the mirror once
more. He scowls at himself and turns out the light.
INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - DAY
Jojo enters the office and is immediately greeted by Captain
Klenzendorf who sits at a desk drawing.
KLENZENDORF
Heyyy, look who it is!
OFFICER 1
The Handgrenade kid!
KLENZENDORF
So, how can we help you today? Are you
missing a pee-pee?
Finkel giggles, he loves Klenzendorf.
JOJO
I’m not missing my pee-pee.
KLENZENDORF
What? Oh, false alarm Finkel. All peepee’s are accounted for. What’s up?
JOJO
If someone turned in a Jew would they
get a medal or something?
KLENZENDORF
Have you found one?
JOJO
I’m on the lookout. I’m learning a lot
about Jews actually.
Really?

KLENZENDORF

JOJO
Did you know they are attracted to
shiny things and they sleep upside
down from the ceiling, like bats?
KLENZENDORF
(nodding, enjoying this)
Ok, bats, yes.

72.
JOJO
And another thing you might be
interested to know is they can read
each others’ minds and their true
language sounds like birds chirping.
KLENZENDORF
And where on earth did you come by
this information?
JOJO
Research. I’m writing a book.
Jojo pulls out his book.
KLENZENDORF
What’s it called?
JOJO
“Yoohoo Jew”.
KLENZENDORF
(stifling laughter)
Pardon?
JOJO
“Yoohoo Jew”. It’s an expose on Jews.
KLENZENDORF
(giggling)
“Yoohoo Jew”, oh my god, I love it!
You could also call it “Jew, Who?”
(new idea)
Ooh! Ooh! What about “Jews News”??
FINKEL
What about Jew... Spoo... Loo
He trails off, not able to make a good joke. Jojo opens his book
and the giggling officers gather to inspect his fantastical
drawings and writings, all carefully penned in the hand of a 10year old. The adults try to contain their amusement.
KLENZENDORF
Oh my, look at that. This guy is
riding a giraffe.
JOJO
One of their modes of transport.
(turning a page)
This is a drawing of their anatomy.
Look, this one here shows the inside
of their heads.

73.
KLENZENDORF
Yes, I can see, they’re filled with
sawdust! So informative! You’re
something else kid. Well, it’s all
very interesting stuff Jojo but I’m
afraid right now I have slightly more
important things on my plate. Namely
the impending invasion of our
wonderful Vienna. But boy, you do have
an imagination on you, I love it!
JOJO
But it’s real, not imagina-KLENZENDORF
Oh, of course it is! When I was your
age I had a “friend” called Kack who
used wet my bed when I was asleep. He
got me in so much trouble.
(beat)
He also shit my pants sometimes.
Naughty Kack.
JOJO
(weakly)
I already have an imaginary friend. I
know the difference.
KLENZENDORF
(not listening)
Hey, you might like to check out my
drawings. I’m re-designing the SSUniforms. A re-vamp if you will.
He holds up a sketch of a man wearing a tasselled uniform, cape,
and large PIRATE HAT.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
It’s based loosely on East Asian
fashions but also has a distinct
pirate skew. Sort of warrior meets
musketeer. Note the feathers down the
arms for aerodynamics. The sparkly
collar is to dazzle the enemy and the
pirate hat is purely decorational.
Same with the high-heel boots.
(suddenly covering the
picture with his hand)
This is all copyrighted by the way.
FINKEL
It’s copyrighted which means you can’t
copy it.

74.
Jojo gives up.
JOJO
Are there any conscriptions today?
KLENZENDORF
No, not right now. But I do have
another job for you. I won’t lie, it’s
a bit of a step-down from delivering
conscriptions but you still get some
good face time with the locals.
FINKEL
Jew. Shoe... Boo.. Hoo.
Finkel sinks his head.
EXT. TOWN - HOUSE - DAY
Jojo knocks at a house. An OLD WOMAN answers.
JOJO
Good morning Frau. Our brave troops
and wonderful Führer need your help. I
am collecting much needed metal for
the war effort which will provide our
troops with... um, bullets and
airplanes. And guns, tanks, ships, Uboats, bombs. And Iron Crosses.
What?

OLD WOMAN

JOJO
Do you have anything metal?
She stares at him a while.
What?

OLD WOMAN

Jojo wheels his barrow away.
EXT. TOWN - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - LATER
Jojo wheels his barrow through town collecting metal. In his
barrow are various items; a piece of RUSTED STEEL, a LEAD PIPE,
a few NUTS & BOLTS.
He notices that some of the Hitler Propaganda Posters he put up
earlier are falling down. He tries to stick one back up but it
immediately falls down again.

75.

Jojo?

VOICE (O.S.)

He turns to see YORKI approaching.
Yorki!

JOJO

The two embrace. Jojo steps back to take in his old friend who
dressed in a soldier’s uniform. But it’s still the same old
Yorki, clumsy and a bit pudgy.
JOJO (CONT’D)
You’re a soldier?
YORKI
At your service!
JOJO
But you’re only 12.
YORKI
I know! They think we’re just as good
as the older lads so they’re
recruiting us early. And look at this
uniform, it’s state of the art!
Jojo feels the uniform. It is made out of CARDBOARD covered in
GREEN MATERIAL.
JOJO
It’s thin. Is that... paper?
YORKI
Hmm, that’s what I thought at first
too. But it’s “paper like”. It’s the
latest material invented by our top
scientists. It keeps you warm in snow
and cool in the desert. It’s also
impervious to shrapnel, bullets and
some bombs. And, because it will never
degrade I can grow into it!
He holds up his arm, the sleeve is way too long.
JOJO
Well, I’m impressed. You finally made
it. Next stop, Hitler’s guard.
YORKI
Exactly! And I’m only 12! So geil!
(beat)
What have you been doing?

76.
Jojo shuffles on the spot.
JOJO
I... caught a Jew. A real one.
YORKI
Wow, good for you! I saw some that
they caught hiding in the forest last
month. Personally I didn’t see what
all the fuss was about. They weren’t
at all scary and seemed kind of
normal. But don’t tell anyone I said
that.
He starts off in the opposite direction.
YORKI (CONT’D)
I have to go show this uniform to my
mama. Take care Jojo, you’re looking
good!
JOJO
Yorki, can I ask a favour?
Of course!

YORKI

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - DAY
Jojo lightly taps on Elsa’s wall, opens the door and holds
something out for her.
JOJO
I got you this, it’s nothing, just
stupid pencils. It doesn’t mean
anything. They’re probably broken.
Elsa takes her gift, some sheets of paper rolled around a
collection of pencils, some coloured, tied together with string.
Thank you.

ELSA

JOJO
I doubt they even work.
Thank you.

ELSA

JOJO
Yeah well, maybe you can draw
something. Maybe more pictures for my
book. Or not. I don’t care.

77.
Jojo turns away, quiet.
ELSA
Can I draw you again?
JOJO
Don’t make fun please.
I’m not.

ELSA

JOJO
Find a real face.
ELSA
It is a real face.
JOJO
You’re blind. It’s a bad, ugly face.
No normal person would come near this.
ELSA
The outside is not what’s important.
JOJO
It makes a pretty big difference
actually. The girl from Jungvolk,
Gudrun, she used to like me but now,
no way.
ELSA
What do you care what she thinks?
JOJO
Um, because she’s only the prettiest
girl in the whole town.
ELSA
If she was that special she wouldn’t
even see your face.
JOJO
Well that’s not a problem seeing she
can’t bare to look at me. Look, it’s
fine, I’ll just accept that I’ll be
one of those guys who will never get
to kiss a girl.
(beat)
And I’m not fishing for anything by
the way. I feel quite strongly about
this.
ELSA
You will be kissed, Jojo.

78.
JOJO
By someone’s grandmother, sure.
ELSA
Do you want me to kiss you?
JOJO
Woah. Ok, 2 things. Thing number one:
it’s illegal for Nazis and Jews to
hang out like we do, let alone kiss,
so already it’s out of the question.
And thing number 2: it would just be a
sympathy kiss which doesn’t count.
ELSA
You’re not a Nazi.
JOJO
What are you talking about? Of course
I am.
ELSA
You’re not a Nazi.
JOJO
I’m into Swastikas. In fact, I love
‘em so I think that’s a pretty good
sign right there.
ELSA
You’re not a Nazi, Jojo.
JOJO
Not to be rude but I don’t think you
know anything about Nazis.
ELSA
I don’t think you do either. You’re a
10 year old kid who ‘likes’ Swastikas
and dressing up in a funny uniform.
The rest... is something else. But
you’re not one of them. Not you.
JOJO
(rolling his eyes)
Okayyyy... Let’s just agree to
disagree alright?
(beat, to himself)
Not a Nazi, ha.
He picks at an imaginary thing on the wall. Elsa stares at
herself in the mirror.

79.
ELSA
What a dirty Jew.
Jojo gets an idea.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
Elsa pours a large pot of hot water into a wash basin. She
wrings a flannel into the bowl and unties her dress, letting it
slip to the floor.
Outside the bathroom, Jojo sits against the wall, listening to
the sound of Elsa bathing. He closes his eyes.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRAU BETZLER’S ROOM - LATER
Back in his mother’s room Jojo sits on the bed as Elsa puts on
make-up and does her hair.
As he watches Elsa, Jojo shivers a little. He looks down and
puts his hand on his TUMMY, then looks back at Elsa, worried.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Downstairs, Jojo leads Elsa into the living room. She looks
around. They speak in low voices.
ELSA
‘Living room’. Funny name.
JOJO
Stay away from the windows.
Yes, Dad.

ELSA

Jojo reveals a meal of green potatoes. They are barely cooked.
JOJO
It’s all I could get.
She takes one and bites into it. It is crunchy. They laugh.
Suddenly there is a LOUD KNOCKING at the door. The children
freeze.
JOJO (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Mama’s home. You better hide.

80.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
More KNOCKING.
JOJO
(calling out)
Lost your key, Mama?
Jojo reaches the door and opens it, revealing FOUR MEN in trenchcoats accompanied by Captain Klenzendorf. The others are GESTAPO
AGENTS led by an officious CAPTAIN DEERTZ.
DEERTZ
Heil Hitler. Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Captain Herman Deertz of
the Vienna Gestapo, Floridsdorf
office. This is Herr Mueller, Herr
Junker, and Herr Frosch.
(then)
Heil Hitler.
JOJO
Heil Hitler.
(to Mueller)
Heil Hitler.
MUELLER
Heil Hitler.
JOJO
(to Junker)
Heil Hitler.
JUNKER
Heil Hitler.
JOJO
(to Frosch)
Heil Hitler.
FROSCH
Heil Hitler.
Now, we--

DEERTZ

KLENZENDORF (O.S.)
Sorry I’m late, my bicycle got a flat
tire. I carried it.
They are interrupted by Captain Klenzendorf entering, late,
carrying a bicycle, trailed by Finkel. The other agents look
down on Klenzendorf.

81.
DEERTZ
Ah, Klenzendorf. Heil Hitler.
KLENZENDORF
Heil Hitler.
Finkel joins in and the two men Heil Hitler everyone in the room
all over again. Finally...
JOJO
Heil Hitler...
KLENZENDORF
Yes Johannes, we’ve Heil Hitler’d you
already.
(then)
So, did I miss anything?
DEERTZ
No, we were just Heil Hitlering each
other and were about to ransack the
house.
He nods to the other agents who start snooping around the house,
inspecting drawers, cupboards, shelves. Deertz smiles and moves
into the Living Room. Jojo and Klenzendorf follow. Deertz
examines the plate of potatoes. Sees the nibbled one, then the
TWO SETS OF CUTLERY.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)
So, young Jojo, We hear you have been
helping out at the Hitlerjugend
office.
Yes.

JOJO

DEERTZ
Good for you. I wish more of our
citizens had your commitment.
KLENZENDORF
Johannes is a fantastic volunteer.
He’s very imaginative.
Deertz moves to the book-case, looks at the literature. The
other two officers make notes and start trudging up the stairs.
Deertz leads Jojo and Klenzendorf down the hall. They stop at
Jojo’s room. Deertz peeks inside.
DEERTZ
Your room?
(entering)
Nice drawings! Wow, look at this.

82.
He points at a drawing of David killing Goliath.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)
This kid is killing a giant. You see
this Klenzendorf?
KLENZENDORF
Yes, these are well executed. Did you
know I also draw? I have better
perspective and shading too.
Ignoring him, Deertz wanders on.
DEERTZ
(to Jojo)
I see someone vandalised your house.
The front door.
Children.

JOJO

DEERTZ
(smiling)
Children?! The brats! What is this
world coming to? What did it say? It
has almost been washed away.
JOJO
I don’t know. A number.
DEERTZ
A number? You know what it means?
No.

JOJO

DEERTZ
Oh, that’s a shame.
There is a loud bang upstairs, something being overturned. Jojo
and the Officer look up.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)
(smiling)
What on earth are those oafs up to?
Why don’t we go upstairs and see. Yes?
He puts an arm around Jojo and they head upstairs.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS
They stop at Jojo’s mother’s room. The officers are looking
through her dresser and wardrobe, under the mattress.

83.
DEERTZ
Do you know where your mother is?
JOJO
No. I think she’s in town.
Klenzendorf exhales heavily, clearly uncomfortable.
DEERTZ
Is she? Hm.
(then)
Well it’s good to see you are still
wearing your Jugend uniform.
(beat)
But... where is your DJ knife?
Jojo looks down to his little sheath, it is still empty. From
behind them.
It’s here.

ELSA (O.S.)

They turn to see Elsa standing at the door to Inga’s room. She
holds the knife in her hand and wears a dress and shirt of
Inga’s. She looks beautiful and... quite German. Jojo is wideeyed, panicked.
DEERTZ
And who might you be?
ELSA
Who might YOU be? And what are you
doing in my house?
DEERTZ
You live here too?
JOJO
This... is...
ELSA
(mocking Jojo)
Thisss... isssss...
(to Deertz)
Speak properly idiot. You’ll have to
excuse my heavily retarded brother,
I’m Inga Betzler.
There is an awkward pause. Klenzendorf COUGHS. Jojo tries to
stall.
JOJO
Heil Hitler.

84.
ELSA
Heil. Hitler.
DEERTZ
Heil Hitler.
The others agents join in and we go through another long round
of Heil Hitler salutes, this time with Elsa.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)
I didn’t know you had a sister,
Johannes.
ELSA
Well sometimes he’d prefer I was dead.
Wouldn’t you, little Frankenstein?
DEERTZ
Now, now, no need to attack his
physicality. It’s a war wound.
ELSA
I’ll speak to him how I like. Besides,
it isn’t a war wound, he was born like
that.
DEERTZ
And why do you have his knife?
ELSA
I’m guarding my room because he
refuses to stay out of it.
DEERTZ
What do you have hidden in there?
ELSA
(smiling)
Oh you know, girl’s stuff.
Deertz goes to enter Inga’s room.
May I?
Naturally.

DEERTZ
ELSA

He wanders in, inspecting the room. He walks past Elsa’s secret
door where the painting that covers it hangs crooked.
Klenzendorf enters and walks past Jojo, eyeing him.

85.
DEERTZ
You see we deal with an overwhelming
number of reports, denunciations, and
general investigations which means we
are severely understaffed and
overworked.
He opens the curtains and looks out the window. We hear a
scraping sound and reveal that Klenzendorf is straightening the
painting. He then stands in front of the wall opening,
concealing it.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)
Now, of course we are indeed
interested in problems of crime and
anti-party sentiment, but we still
have one greater concern; that of the
Goldilocksies, running around out
there taking advantage of other people
in this city. Sneaking around, taking
things, eating people’s food, wearing
their clothes... It’s simply rude.
(beat, to Elsa)
I don’t suppose we could see your
papers could I?
Elsa freezes.
Hmm?

DEERTZ (CONT’D)

KLENZENDORF
Papers! Quick, we don’t have all day.
He holds out his hand.
ELSA
Yes, of course.
Elsa goes to a drawer in Inga’s dresser and pulls out INGA’S
PAPERS. Her hand is beginning to shake, Klenzendorf takes the
papers from her and looks at them, now and then flicking a look
to Elsa.
POV of the papers shows Inga when she was sick, GAUNT and PALE;
the two girls share a vague resemblance. The DATE OF BIRTH
reads: May 7, 1929.
KLENZENDORF
How old are you in this photo?
ELSA
They’re 3 years old, I was 12.

86.
KLENZENDORF
Date of birth?
A tense moment as Elsa pauses. A pin dropping would be quite
audible right now...
ELSA
May 1, 1929.
Another long pause. Elsa wipes her sweaty hand on her dress.
KLENZENDORF
Correct.
(beat)
Thank you Inga. Get a new photo.
Klenzendorf hands the papers back while the other agents arrive
from Frau Betzler’s room. They hand Deertz some envelopes and
photos and papers.
DEERTZ
Good good. Well, we’ll be borrowing
some of these little things if you
don’t mind. Nice meeting you.
ELSA
Heil Hitler.
More Heil Hitlers. Jojo just stands there, watching.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
The men are almost out the front door.
DEERTZ
As usual, call us if you notice
anything suspicious.
The officers leave. Klenzendorf stares at Jojo then smiles.
KLENZENDORF
Listen Johannes, we are scaling down
our operations at the Jugend office so
there’s not really any work for you
right now. Your services are no longer
required.
Jojo nods.
KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
Take care Jojo. Stay home. Look after
yourself.

87.
He gives a concerned, yet endearing smile, then leaves.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ELSA’S HIDEOUT - MOMENTS LATER
Elsa sits huddled in the corner, clutching Inga’s papers. Jojo
approaches.
JOJO
Elsa, you fooled them. Elsa?
May 7.
What?

ELSA
JOJO

ELSA
She was born May 7, not the first.
Jojo takes the papers and reads.
ELSA (CONT’D)
They’ll be back. They’ll find out
she’s dead. Then I’ll be dead. I have
to leave here. I have to get out.
JOJO
No. He’s helping us. Either way no one
will know. I’ve seen the Records Room,
it’s a complete mess. They won’t
bother.
ELSA
They always bother.
JOJO
They won’t. Nobody really knows she
died. You can be her Elsa. It’s okay,
I’ll tell mama I know about you and
that we’re friends...
Elsa retreats away from Jojo.
ELSA
Jew and Nazi are not friends.
This hits Jojo, he steps back. Elsa buries her head into her
hands and begin to cry. Jojo waits a moment and then moves
downstairs.

88.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Adolf Hitler wears oven gloves and stirs a pot that is heating
on the stove, with a ladle. He smells the broth.
ADOLF
Mmm, lecker soup.
JOJO
It’s just hot water, you don’t need to
stir it.
Fine.

ADOLF

He puts the ladle down, crosses his arms.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
So that was pretty much a bust. I
can’t believe they fell for her
disguise. Mind explaining that?
JOJO
I don’t want to talk about it.
ADOLF
Well I’m not a mind reader Jojo.
(beat)
Actually I am, it’s one of my
abilities. But I still can’t work out
what’s going on here.
JOJO
Nothing. I just, I’m confused and
tired.
ADOLF
(immature)
Ewwwwwww, tired. Widdle Jojo’s tired,
and a widdle bit confused. Ewww, poor
Jojo, and he’s a widdle bit hungwy and
the only thing he can cook is this
invisible soup. Ooh, can I get you
some invisible soup Jojo?
He mime pours some soup into a bowl and mimes eating it.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Ewwww, I’m eating invisible soup
because there’s no more food. I’ll eat
anything, even ants. Ewwww, and now
I’m a robot anteater.
(in a robot voice)
(MORE)

89.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Ooh, where’s all the ants? I only eat
ants. Must eat ants.
He stops his performance, suddenly serious. He’s made his point,
whatever that is. Jojo stares at him, baffled.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Okay? To clarify: Get your shit
together and sort out your priorities.
You’re ten, Jojo. Start acting like
it.
He walks out, dramatically knocking over a cup.
EXT. TOWN - FOOD STORE - MORNING
Jojo is at the FOOD STORE. He hands over ONE RATION CARD. In
return they give him a tiny piece of bread and a small piece of
butter. He puts them in his pocket and leaves.
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - AFTERNOON
Jojo wheels his barrow down an alley which opens up into
Floridsdorfer Spitz, a town square. He rests a moment and sees a
BUTTERFLY moving past him along a row of flowers.
Jojo smiles at this, takes interest and follows the butterfly,
limping behind as it flutters along the flower bed. He moves
further away from his barrow and into the park proper, moving
around a few trees. He crouches and admires the butterfly which
has now come to a stop upon another flower. Not yet looking up
Jojo notices the light on the ground is disturbed by shadows
moving back and forth. He looks up and sees he is standing near
the site of the PUBLIC HANGING. TEN or so bodies hang from the
gallows.
A sign nailed to a nearby tree reveals these people have been
executed for treason, crimes against the Reich and involvement
with a Resistance movement. Painted in white across the bodies’
chests we see:
O 5
The bodies sway in the wind in a kind of floating waltz. Jojo
tilts his head back and forth in rhythm and shuffles along the
row of bodies. Most are men, a couple of girls. Then as he nears
the row he sees one body in a dirty dress, a woman drifting in
the breeze, twisting on the rope until she turns towards us,
fully revealing her face... his MOTHER, FRAU BETZLER.

90.
Jojo steps back, falls to the ground, eyes wide open, staring
back at her. He begins to cry, suddenly losing his brave
exterior and becoming the 10 year old child he is.
Jojo gets to his feet, goes to his mother and tries to reach her
hand. It is too high. He looks down her body and notices her
shoelace is untied. He tries to re-tie it but fumbles. He gives
up and rests his head against her leg.
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - DUSK
As the sun sets Jojo remains in the park, sitting near his
mother, quiet and still.
A pair of shiny shoes appear next to Jojo. He looks up to see
Adolf Hitler staring back at him with sympathetic eyes.
Jojo hangs his head again. Adolf touches him on the shoulder and
disappears into the night.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ELSA’S HIDEOUT - NIGHT
Elsa reads by candlelight. The panel opens and Jojo stands
before her, a knife in his hand.
Jojo?

ELSA

He runs at her but it’s more of a hobble, she stops him, they
struggle against each other.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Jojo, stop!
She pushes him away, he trips and falls, losing the knife. He
stands and runs at her again and again until he finally
collapses to the ground. He lies on his back and stares upwards.
Mama...

JOJO

Elsa covers her mouth, begins to cry.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
Jojo and Elsa stand on a ladder in the attic, their heads poking
out through the ROOFTOP HATCH. Distant bombing continues.
JOJO
She was with others. They had a number
on them.

91.

O5.

ELSA

Jojo looks at her, she knows?
ELSA (CONT’D)
The Resistance, Jojo. O-Five. The ‘O’
stands for Oesterreich, Austria. The 5
is the fifth letter of the alphabet,
‘E’. Together it makes “OE”, the way
we used to spell Austria before the
Nazi regime. “Oesterreich”. She was
part of this.
JOJO
Did you know this before?
ELSA
Sort of. She didn’t tell me much, only
that she worked with friends and that
your father was somehow involved from
afar.
JOJO
What? No, he’s fighting in the war.
ELSA
She didn’t want to tell you anything
for obvious reasons.
JOJO
(nodding, tearing up)
Because I’m a Nazi.
ELSA
No, because she didn’t want you to
know anything that would get you in
trouble. She wanted to protect you,
more than anything, more than me. You
were the most important thing to her.
JOJO
But they found out what she was doing
in the end. They got her.
ELSA
Jojo, I’m sorry. She died trying to
save lives. That is the greatest
honour any human can achieve.
JOJO
But now I have nothing. No one.
Elsa puts an arm around his shoulder. More bombs.

92.
ELSA
The last time I saw my parents was at
Westbanhof. They were put on a train,
my cousin made me run with him and
hide behind the terminus. Later we
were sleeping in the forest, others
were there. They found us. They shot
everyone, Franz too. I ran and slowly
found my way back to the city. A
friend of my fathers hid me. Then
another friend, then friends of
friends... till she took me in.
(then)
So far I am still here. But my parents
went to a place you don’t come back
from.
He leans his head on her shoulder. They sit like this in the
moonlight.
JOJO
Please don’t leave.
She smiles.
ELSA
Where would I go? As long as they’re
out there I will stay here.
The BOMBING gets louder...
MONTAGE - JOJO AND ELSA
- Jojo and Elsa hang blankets over the windows as the bombing
continues.
- Jojo barters with a local PEASANT for some OLD VEGETABLES.
- Elsa draws pictures of her surroundings; the view, the objects
in the room, Jojo.
- Jojo walks past a wall where he previously tacked pictures of
Hitler and propaganda notices. Some of the Hitler pictures have
been torn away leaving half of the Fuhrer’s face.
- Jojo peruses Elsa’s drawings. He finds one of a BUTTERFLY.
- Jojo pins the butterfly drawing to his wall, near a photo of
Hitler.
- Jojo attempts to prepare food in his kitchen. Obviously he’s a
terrible cook.

93.
- Jojo’s bedroom; Jojo pins another one of Elsa’s drawings on
the wall. There are now as many of them as his pictures of
Hitler.
- Jojo delivers a plate of pretty questionable food to Elsa.
They eat together. Mid-meal, fixated on Elsa, Jojo looks down at
his tummy again. SUPERIMPOSED over his stomach we see an image
of hundreds of butterflies fluttering around in an empty cave.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S ROOM - MORNING
Outside the window we hear birds chirping and see fresh leaves
on the trees. It’s SPRING. Jojo is reading a letter to Elsa. She
is listening with a smile on her face.
JOJO
New works by Elsa Korr. Reviewed by
Mr. Smith...son...stein...berg.
They’re Jewish; the gallery is in New
York.
(clears his throat)
I had the pleasure of seeing some
really great drawings by a young girl
from Austria named Elsa Korr. She
certainly has an eye for detail; her
pictures of butterflies are
incredible. And I loved the drawing of
the man riding a giraffe. But what
really stood out was the one of the
interesting little boy. It made me
wonder a lot about him and what he was
thinking about because he looked like
he was thinking about stuff. Overall
it was a great collection and I see a
bright future for this girl, wherever
she is. I encourage her to keep going
with the drawings.
(beat)
Four out of five stars.
ELSA
Wow, that’s pretty positive.
JOJO
Yeah.
(then)
They want to do another exhibition in
June so give me some more drawings and
I’ll send them off.
Playing along, Elsa hands him another pile of her drawings.

94.
ELSA
Thanks, Gertrude Stein.
He smiles and leaves.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo opens a drawer and places Elsa’s pictures inside. We see
there is an even bigger collection of drawings inside.
A distant explosion is heard, the rumbling causing objects and
windows to shake and rattle. The sound of gunshots comes soon
after. Jojo rushes out.
EXT. GRUSCH GROCERY - DAY
Jojo heads down a street and finds a group of civilian locals
being given weapons and instructions on how to use them. There
are a couple of women and young boys among them, all looking
very out of their element and bewildered. Two younger kids help
each other carry a huge MACHINE GUN off towards the fighting.
An explosion a few blocks away. Civilians run the opposite way
towards safety. Jojo runs too. He rounds a corner and sees
Yorki, his uniform in tatters, running on the other side of the
street carrying boxes of ammunition and a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
Yorki!

JOJO

Yorki sees Jojo, waves, trips and falls, accidentally FIRING the
Rocket Launcher. It launches a missile across the road,
completely blowing out a store front. GLASS and DEBRIS shower
the street.
YORKI
Shit! Jojo, you okay?! I’m so clumsy.
JOJO
Yorki, what’s going on?
YORKI
The Russians Jojo, they’re coming. And
the Americans from the other way. And
England and China and Africa and India
and Australia. Shit, it’s everyone!
JOJO
How are we doing?

95.
YORKI
Are you kidding? Terribly! Our only
friends are the Japanese and just
between you and me, they don’t look
very Aryan. The whole country’s run
out of money. I mean look at this
uniform, it really IS made of paper.
They just glued a layer thin cotton
over the top of it.
He turns around and see the back of his jacket has been
completely burned off. We see it is made of CARDBOARD covered in
thin COTTON.
YORKI (CONT’D)
You’re lucky you got out, this is
crazy. Go and hide, buddy.
He tries to lift the boxes of ammunition up again but has
difficulty.
YORKI (CONT’D)
Shit, and someone should tell you how
heavy guns and bullets are.
JOJO
What’s it like out there?
YORKI
Ummm... shitty. It’s fun at first but
then it’s really scary. Hans, that big
asshole from Jungvolk training, he got
killed about a week ago. His head got
shot off. I saw it - SHOT OFF! And he
was still standing holding his gun and
then he did a little dance like this.
Yorki shimmies on his feet for a second. Silly.
YORKI (CONT’D)
I know you’re not supposed to laugh
but it looked so funny. Plus he was
such an asshole.
(then)
I gotta go.
JOJO
Take me with you, I can help. I wanna
be part of it!
YORKI
Why? We’re losing.

96.
JOJO
No we’re not. We can’t lose, it’s
impossible. We’re German. We don’t
know how to lose, we’re invincible.
YORKI
Tell that to old Hans “No more head”.
(then)
Ok, come. I gotta get this ammo to the
gunners. You can help me.
Yorki puts the ammo in Jojo’s barrow and they head off.
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - BEETHOVEN PLATZ - DAY
They reach a square, the fire-fight in the distance gets closer.
There are a few other explosions, heard but not seen, down the
street. It’s loud and chaotic. Other soldiers run around, many
of them are JOJO’s AGE. Jojo is a little bewildered.
YORKI
Woah, listen, they’re getting closer.
JOJO
Remember that Jew I told you about?
YORKI
Oh yeah. You caught one.
JOJO
I still have her. She’s basically my
girlfriend.
YORKI
Good for you Jojo! A girlfriend!
JOJO
But she’s, y’know... Jewish.
YORKI
There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews Jojo. That’s the Russians
out there. They’re worse than anyone.
We’ve been told they eat babies and
have sex with dogs. I mean, that’s
bad, right?
JOJO
Sex with dogs?

97.
YORKI
Yeah, and the Englishmen do it too. We
have to stop them before they eat us
and fuck all our dogs. It’s crazy.
(then)
Wait, what’s that annoying music?
Just then, we hear PACHELBEL’S CANON in D and we see KLENZENDORF
run past, stopping near the boys. We see that he is wearing his
uniform but it has been altered according to his earlier
drawing. It has SPARKLY SEQUINS on the collar and TASSELS down
the sleeves. He wears HIGH HEEL BOOTS and is carrying a MACHINE
GUN which has a RADIO strapped to it, playing the music.
Obviously, he’s also wearing a PIRATE HAT.
Finkel runs up, dressed in a similar outfit, but he wears a cape
made of pink triangle patches. He stands proudly next to Captain
K, there is an electric energy between them. Klenzendorf gives a
triumphant smile, doffs his pirate hat and runs off, Finkel
close behind, Pachelbel swelling.
YORKI (CONT’D)
Okay, I gotta go Jojo, the guys need
these bullets.
JOJO
We were born to die for Germany.
YORKI
Yeah? Well I’m still not gonna laugh
when they shoot me.
(prodding his fat belly)
Shit, I’m a pretty big target too.
He heads across the plaza, the gunfire gets louder. Jojo calls
out.
JOJO
Yorki, you’re my best friend!
But Yorki can’t hear him, he continues around the corner, out of
sight. There are more shots and yelling. Suddenly a huge
explosion rocks the street, debris and smoke pours around the
corner and back into the square. Jojo hides behind a tree and
watches as German soldiers come running from the street, some
are gunned down, others hide behind vehicles and continue to
engage the enemy. Klenzendorf runs around too, his Pirate Hat is
on fire.
Jojo runs back up a side-street, away from the chaos.
FADE OUT.

98.
SFX: TRIUMPHANT MUSIC AND THE SOUND OF TANKS ROLLING
EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY
Jojo walks down a street, music blares, an anthem of some sort.
He stares wide-eyed as the CANNIBAL TRIBES of RUSSIA, GREAT
BRITAIN, and AMERICA parade down the street. Some people are
waving, happy. Others devastated, unwilling to accept defeat.
A Russian soldier passes by and thrusts a small Union-Jack flag
into Jojo’s hand. He says something indecipherable and continues
on. An excitable WOMAN (30 plus holding her child) runs past
them.
JOJO
What’s happening?
WOMAN
It’s over! The war is over! We will
have peace!
JOJO
What do you mean?
WOMAN
The Allies have won. The war is over!
Americaaaaa!!! Everyone is free!
Everyone is free!
Fantasy Adolf Hitler joins Jojo.
ADOLF
I have no idea what’s going on but I
do like the little flags and the
parade.
JOJO
Wha-? Adolf the war is over, what now?
We lost!
ADOLF
Good. That means your stupid freeloading girlfriend can finally go away
to Paris with Nathan. Then it’ll just
be you and me like normal.
Jojo looks worried.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
That’s what we want, right?
He skips away, waving a flag.

99.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
No more girl in the attic! No more
girl in the attic! Yayyy!
EXT. TOWN - STREET - LATER
The streets are quiet, heavy with Russian presence. Jojo stands
in line at a FOOD RATION STATION, holding a bag. Among the
GERMAN CIVILIANS and RUSSIAN TROOPS he feels like a stranger. A
tank rumbles past with the sounds of Soviet music wafting out.
He stumbles upon a make-shift morgue for the casualties of the
final battle for Vienna. He walks past many dead German boys and
men. Some are draped in their ARMY COATS. He stops near one who
lies the same way. He pulls the Army Coat off the body... it is
a stranger but a young lad all the same. Jojo rolls up the coat
and puts it under his arm.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - EVENING
Wearing the jacket, Jojo stands at the door to Elsa’s room. He
puts a hand on the door, clearly debating something internally.
He enters, Elsa is at the window, peering through a crack in the
curtain as fireworks go off and music plays in the distance.
ELSA
Jojo! What’s happening out there?
JOJO
Hmm? Where?
ELSA
Out there dummy! Listen.
JOJO
Oh, I’m not sure. Celebrations?
For what?

ELSA

Jojo doesn’t answer.
ELSA (CONT’D)
For what, Jojo? Tell me...
(beat)
Wait... is it over?
He nods.
ELSA (CONT’D)
The war is over?!

100.
He nods again.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Yes!!! It’s over!!!
She stands, hugs Jojo, skips around the room and draws the
curtains wide.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Come, we must go outside! Come on
Jojo! We are free! I can go home! I
can go!
Jojo just stares ahead, bites his lip.
JOJO
You can’t go.
ELSA
What, why? What’s wrong?
(beat)
Jojo?
She looks back out the window, her smile fades. She steps back
from the window into the room.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Who won...?
(then)
Jojo, who won the war?
Jojo takes his time and making his decision... speaks.
JOJO
We did.
(then)
Hitler won the war.
Her face drops, she slinks to the ground, broken.
ELSA
But, they said the Allies were going
to win.
Long silence as tears well in her eyes. She walks back to her
hideout.
ELSA (CONT’D)
Congratulations.
JOJO
I’m sorry.
(then)
But you can still stay here.
(MORE)

101.
JOJO (CONT'D)
That’s one good thing. You’ll live
with me. Here.
ELSA
Yes. And I’ll die here too. In this
room, just like Inga.
JOJO
No. I will look after you.
ELSA
Or they will come and find me and do
it themselves.
JOJO
No they won’t.
ELSA
(panic building)
They’re going to get me.
JOJO
I’ll take care of you!
ELSA
(snapping)
You can’t take care of anything! Not
even yourself. You’re a monster like
all of the others! Monster!!!
Elsa flops down on the bed and bursts into tears.
INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
CLOSE UP on a word written on a BLACKBOARD:
MONSTERS!
Jojo sits in a broken down classroom with some other children.
They are being addressed by a woman, a RUSSIAN TEACHER. On the
board behind her are written other words like BEASTS, KILLERS,
EVIL, ANIMALS, DEVILS, INHUMAN, BAD, UGLY...
The teacher speaks in a RUSSIAN ACCENT.
RUSSIAN TEACHER
What else do we know about the German
Nazis? Hmm? They are also HEARTLESS.
(she writes)
Now, you beautiful children are not
like these Germans, you will learn to
be better Germans, ok? More like the
Russians.
(MORE)

102.
RUSSIAN TEACHER (CONT'D)
Because Germans are bad people, they
do very bad things. They have very bad
taste in art and music, they have bad
hearts. Now, you need to learn how to
be better Germans. Who wants to be
better Germans?
A little confused the children tentatively raise their hands.
Jojo looks beside him and sees Adolf Hitler sitting in the seat
next to him, his hand is also raised. He looks to Jojo and
smiles.
ADOLF
(whispering)
I want to be a better German! Pick me!
(looking to Jojo)
Put your hand up! Don’t you want to be
better?
After a beat, Jojo joins in and raises his hand.
RUSSIAN TEACHER
Wunderbarrr! Now. Come and collect
some of these silly old German books.
We’re going to tear them to a million
pieces!
She indicates a large pile of German literature stacked at the
front of the class. She takes a thick book and rips it in half
with her strong Russian hands.
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - DAY
Jojo walks through the city, he sees some Russian soldiers
busting into a house, looting it. Others are pushing an old
piano out of a window as locals watch on. Gunshots are heard
across the city.
Jojo enters the square where he found his mother. There is some
commotion on the other side of the trees. He walks over and sees
a group of German men and women who have been rounded up by an
angry mob. Temporary police made up of Russians do little as
they are taunted and beaten and spat on.
Among the group being rounded up Jojo sees OFFICER DEERTZ,
FRAULEIN RAHM and also HERR KLENZENDORF, his revamped uniform is
tatters. Jojo’s spying NEIGHBOURS are also with their group,
stumbling around looking desperate. They are all being jostled
about by PARTISANS and LOCALS and Jojo watches as Fraulein Rahm,
his teacher from Hitlerjugend Camp gets dragged from the group.
She looks haggard and tries to break free in panic.

103.
FRAULEIN RAHM
No... I... I was helping them. I was
good to the Jews. Please, someone tell
them, I helped them!
Someone SPITS in her face. Her and FIVE OTHERS are led to a
STONE WALL and lined up. Before we see what happens next Jojo
finds himself carried with the wave of bystanders where he
passes another group of prisoners.
It is here that he meets with Captain Klenzendorf. They make eyecontact and we see Klenzendorf has been beaten up. Nevertheless,
he gives a nice warm, gentle smile.
Captain K.

JOJO

KLENZENDORF
Heya kid. Look at all this commotion,
huh?
JOJO
What’s going on?
KLENZENDORF
Not much. My dear Finkel is dead.
Sorry.

JOJO

KLENZENDORF
Mm, I was quite fond of him.
(beat, looking round)
Wow, now is not a good time to be
dressed like a Nazi.
(then)
Hey, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I
think your book is really great. I’m
sorry for laughing at it. There’s some
very important stuff in there. You
should publish it.
A PARTISAN with a rifle pulls Jojo forward.
PARTISAN
You know each other?
JOJO
(pointing at Klenzendorf)
Him. Yes.
How?

PARTISAN

104.
Jojo pauses.
PARTISAN (CONT’D)
How do you know him? He is Nazi. A
Nazi yes?
JOJO
No, he’s... He helped...
Nazi.

PARTISAN

JOJO
No, he’s just a...
PARTISAN
(to Klenzendorf)
You know the ugly boy?
A brief moment as Klenzendorf stares at Jojo.
KLENZENDORF
Oh, I’ve seen him round but I don’t
know him. Go away little boy.
PARTISAN
Yeah, go away ugly little gypsy. Scat!
Jojo is pushed back into the crowd, losing sight of Klenzendorf.
Someone calls out a command, indecipherable amongst the cries of
the crazed crowd. As Jojo pushes his way to the back of the mob
we see over the top of the crowd that Klenzendorf and some
others are standing in a line, on a platform. He doesn’t look
back and so doesn’t see all five of them drop out of sight, the
ropes around their necks going tight. All we hear are gasps and
cheers.
EXT. TOWN - RIVER - DAY
Jojo sits on the banks of the river. He watches the water flow
past him as more gunshots and cheering can be heard in the
distance.
He looks over at the bridge and sees a young couple holding
hands, happy. Coming the opposite way, towards Jojo, is YORKI.
They embrace.
Jojo!

YORKI

JOJO
Yorki! I thought you were surely dead.

105.
YORKI
No, I can never die! I fell in a hole
and luckily I’m a little bit fat so I
got stuck. Anyway, a tank parked over
the top of my hole and then that got
blown up and it was a whole 2 days
before anyone found me.
JOJO
I’m glad they did.
YORKI
Me too. I lost three Pounds!
(then)
Did you hear? About Hitler?
What?

JOJO

YORKI
He’s dead. They say he killed himself.
Jojo stares dead ahead.
JOJO
Bullshit. He wouldn’t.
YORKI
He did. He was in a bunker and the
Russians were all outside and he had
nowhere to run and so he did it. He
just blew his brains out. All over the
wall.
JOJO
He blew his brains out?
YORKI
All over the wall. Brains everywhere.
Betrayed us all. Turns out he was
hiding a lot of stuff from us. Doing
some really bad things behind
everyone’s backs. Especially in the
“constipation camps”.
What?

JOJO

YORKI
I don’t really know the details.
Also... look at this.

106.
He hands Jojo a pile of letters, all addressed to Roswita
Betzler, his mother. Jojo sorts through the mail, opens an
envelope.
YORKI (CONT’D)
There’s a whole section at the postoffice. Did I mention I’m a postman
now? Anyway, there’s a bunch of
letters that were confiscated because
of security stuff but I was snooping
around and I found them.
JOJO
They’re from my father.
(looking up, smiling)
This one is from last week. He’s been
in Switzerland.
(then)
I guess he was a deserter after all.
YORKI
That’s ok, I would have too if I had
known what it was like.
They sit for a moment.
JOJO
Can I come and stay at your place for
a while? Until my dad comes home?
YORKI
Sure. That’s probably a good idea,
they’re sending orphans to Hungary.
That’s bad, I heard Hungarians bathe
in human blood. Dracula’s from
somewhere round there so it makes
sense. Yeah, come and stay. You can be
my brother.
JOJO
I’d like that.
(then)
I’m not alone.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - DAY
Jojo enters the room wearing a suit that’s too big for him. The
sleeves and pants are rolled up. He places a sandwich on the
floor near Elsa’s door. He takes a piece of paper and facing
Elsa’s wall he reads...

107.
JOJO
I managed to find another letter for
you at the post office. It’s from
Nathan.
(beat, reading)
Dear Elsa, I hope you aren’t too sad
about the result of the war. Oh well.
But it’s not the end of the world.
There are still small areas on Earth
where it’s ok not to be a Nazi so
please stay alive. Thank God you have
your good friend Johannes to look
after you. He really is a fabulous
person, so brave.
(wincing, is this too much?)
Soooo very brave. It is important that
you stay alive and healthy until I
find you. So eat food, including
sandwiches, if there are any. I love
you, Nathan.
Silence. Jojo folds up the letter and puts it in his pocket.
Elsa opens the door again.
Hi.
Hi.

ELSA
JOJO

Pause.
He’s dead.

ELSA

JOJO
Um, pardon?
ELSA
Nathan.
(then)
Last winter. Tuberculosis.
JOJO
But then who wrote this...?
ELSA
(smiling)
Thank you, kind Jojo. You see, I was
right. You are not one of them.
(beat)
How’s it going out there?

108.
JOJO
Okay. How’s it going in there?
Fabulous.

ELSA

JOJO
We’re friends, right?
ELSA
I’m not sure we’re allowed to be,
remember the rules.
JOJO
I know but, I think it’s ok if no one
knows. I don’t mind hanging out with
you.
ELSA
I don’t mind hanging out with you
either.
JOJO
And if we’re friends you trust me,
right?
ELSA
It depends.
JOJO
Well, what if I told you I found a way
to escape Nazi Germany?
ELSA
What do you mean?
JOJO
I’ve found a way for you to be free.
ELSA
Yes, me too. I’m going to kill myself.
JOJO
Exactly. Wait. No! Not that!
ELSA
Jojo, there’s no point in going on.
There is no place for me anymore.
JOJO
Look, it’s like Nathan said in my fake
letter from him. There are still Nazifree places. I can make it happen, I
know a secret way out.
(MORE)

109.
JOJO (CONT'D)
But you have to trust me and we can’t
delay. Get your things together, we
leave in an hour.
ELSA
Why don’t we wait till night?
JOJO
Are you crazy? Night is when they
expect us to make a move. Look, I
don’t try and tell you how to do art
or poems, do I? No. So please leave
the escape plans up to me. We’ll be
fine. The key is to blend in.
Elsa picks up the sandwich and takes a bite.
ELSA
You think the suit helps?
Jojo looks at himself. It is pretty ridiculous.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jojo is now dressed in his normal clothes. He checks himself out
in the mirror and tucks in his shirt. Adolf Hitler is standing
behind him.
ADOLF (O.S.)
I’m not sure what’s going on with us.
I mean, what you’re doing right now,
I’m not comfortable with it.
JOJO
I don’t think we should hang out
anymore.
ADOLF
Okayyy, that was out of the blue.
JOJO
I can’t be your friend anymore.
ADOLF
Wow, don’t hold back.
Adolf lights a cigarette. Offers Jojo a drag. Jojo takes the
cigarette and throws it in the opposite direction.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
Very mature.
He lights another.

110.
ADOLF (CONT’D)
I gotta say, I’m pretty disappointed.
JOJO
You lied to me. You lied to everyone
and then you blew your brains out.
ADOLF
(cocky)
Brains are very overrated my friend.
JOJO
You ran away. You’re a coward.
ADOLF
That’s a big accusation young man.
Blowing your brains out is actually a
pretty gutsy thing to do. I’d like to
see you try it.
JOJO
I wouldn’t. And would you mind
explaining the constipation camps?
ADOLF
Constellation camps. We encourage
people to Stargaze.
Liar.

JOJO

ADOLF
Okay, okay, I get it, you wanna go
your own way, maybe start a Fourth
Reich or something. Fine. But you know
what, you let me down too so now we’re
even.
JOJO
Even?! How? I believed in you!
ADOLF
Yeah well, you stopped believing.
What’s more you missed my birthday
which was just last week and you ended
up making friends with that thing
upstairs.
JOJO
That thing is a little girl.
Says who?

ADOLF

111.
JOJO
Says anyone who’s ever met a little
girl before!
ADOLF
Well excuse me for not knowing any
little girls.
(then)
You’re in love with her, aren’t you!
Yes, I am.
Admit it!

JOJO
ADOLF

JOJO
I said yes.
ADOLF
I knew it. Well, she’s too old for
you. You don’t stand a chance.
JOJO
If I were bigger and more agile I’d
kick your damn head off.
Adolf steps backwards, wary, a little scared.
ADOLF
Okay look, I’m sorry things didn’t
work out with us. But y’know, we’re
more alike than you think. I’m still
quite proud of you. Intensely
disappointed but also proud.
(then)
I now like to think of you as my
strange, wayward, ugly son.
JOJO
I’m not your son. I’ve already got a
dad and he’s coming home.
He shakes one of his mother’s letters in Adolf’s face.
ADOLF
(hopeful)
What about having two dads?
JOJO
I just want the one!
Adolf nods, he knows it’s over.

112.
ADOLF
Good luck little Jojo Rabbit. I’ll see
you round the traps.
(then)
Before I go, could I give you a little
bit of advice?
Jojo stares at him for a moment.
JOJO
No. Fuck off, Hitler.
Hitler nods knowingly, as if they are sharing a really deep and
important moment of exquisite understanding... yet obviously
hiding his disappointment. He WINKS at Jojo and saunters off.
Jojo TEARS DOWN the pictures of Hitler from his wall.
INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - DAY
Jojo leads Elsa along the hall. Her hair is washed, she wears
clean clothes and holds Inga’s papers. They head down the
stairs. Elsa catches a glimpse into Jojo’s room and sees all of
her drawings on his wall. She hides a small smile and takes Jojo
by the hand.
He smiles, takes a breath and leads her carefully along the
hall, past the various rooms of the house. Pausing now and then
along the way, Jojo takes the time to savour his hand-holding
session with Elsa.
They reach the front door. Jojo looks down and notices
something. He bends down and does up Elsa’s shoelaces. It is
slow-going but he succeeds. He stands.
JOJO
(whispering)
Ready?
Elsa nods.
ELSA
Is it dangerous?
He smiles wide.
Extremely.

JOJO

Jojo WINKS a PERFECT WINK at Elsa, she takes a deep breath and
Jojo opens the door. Light fills the entrance to the house. They
step outside...

113.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Jojo and Elsa stand on the front steps of the house. Elsa looks
at Jojo and then back out to the street. Yorki sits nearby, he
waves, smiling.
On the opposite corner we see a couple of British soldiers
crossing the road talking casually, in ENGLISH. An AMERICAN and
RUSSIAN FLAG can be seen hanging from a building in the
distance.
Realising what is going on, Elsa drops her bag. Jojo shuffles
his feet nervously. After a while, he does a small fist pump.
JOJO
Yes...
(then)
We made it.
Long pause.
The silence is cut by David Bowie’s “HEROES” and we FADE OUT.
SUPER:
Let everything happen to you,
Beauty and Terror,
Just keep going,
No feeling is final.
RILKE
END.
