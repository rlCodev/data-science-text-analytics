COLD OPEN
INT. PLEASANT-LOOKING WAITING ROOM - MORNING
ELEANOR SHELLSTROP (Kristen Bell) opens her eyes. She sits
in a nice-looking waiting room. She looks around, calmly.
From her POV: written on the wall, in HUGE GREEN LETTERS:
WELCOME! EVERYTHING IS FINE.
She smiles a little at that.
Eleanor?

MICHAEL (Ted Danson) emerges.

MICHAEL
Come on in.

INT. MICHAEL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
She settles in across a desk.

He checks a CLIPBOARD.

MICHAEL
Hi Eleanor, I’m Michael.

How are you?

ELEANOR
I’m great. Thank you for asking.
(beat)
One question: Where am I, and who are
you, and what’s going on?
MICHAEL
Right. So: you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are
dead. Your life on Earth has ended, and
you are now in the next phase of your
existence in the universe.
She stares at him, placidly.
ELEANOR
Cool.
(beat)
I have some questions.
MICHAEL
Thought you might.
ELEANOR
...How did I die? I don’t remember.
MICHAEL
Yes, in cases of traumatic, embarrassing,
or sudden death, we erase the memory,
which can be upsetting. Are you sure you
want to hear it?

He checks his clipboard.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
You were in a grocery store parking lot.
You dropped a box of low-calorie fudge
cookies, and when you bent over to pick
it up, a long column of shopping carts
that were being returned to the shopping
cart collection area rolled out of
control and ploughed into you.
Oh boy.

ELEANOR

MICHAEL
You were able to grab onto the front of
the column of shopping carts, but it
swept you out into the street, where you
were struck and killed, by a mobile
billboard truck advertising an erectile
dysfunction pill called “Engorge-ulate.”
Eleanor stares, incredulously, then GIGGLES.
ELEANOR
That’s awful.
MICHAEL
It’s not great. If it makes you feel
better, there have been
(checks clipboard)
927,605 more-embarrassing deaths in
history.
ELEANOR
That does make me feel better, thanks.
(beat)
Okay, so, like, who was right? About all
this? I was a Presbyterian -- did we
totally nail it?
MICHAEL
Eh...not really. The Hindus are a little
bit right, the Muslims are a little bit
right, the Jews, Christians, Buddhists -basically, every religion guessed about
5% of it. Except for Doug Forcett.
ELEANOR
Who’s Doug Forcett?
MICHAEL
He was this stoner kid who lived in
Calgary in the 1970s.

“What do you think happens after we die?”
Doug launched into this long monologue,
and he got it like 92% correct.

I mean, we couldn’t believe what we were
hearing.
Wow.

ELEANOR

He huffed some gasoline, fell asleep, and

front of other people...
MICHAEL
I’m very sorry. You’ll never be afraid
here again, I promise.
She looks happy about that.
ELEANOR
Does that mean I’m...where I think I am?
MICHAEL
Well, it’s not the “heaven” and “hell”
idea you were raised on. But generally
speaking, in the afterlife, there’s a
good place, and there’s a bad place.
You’re in the good place.
(smiles warmly)
You’re okay, Eleanor. You’re in the good
place.
She smiles, relieved.
Well.

ELEANOR
That’s...good!

MICHAEL
Sure is. Now! You’re going to have a
million more questions. Or actually-(checks clipboard)
You’ll have 6,208 more questions.
ELEANOR
How detailed is that clipboard?!
MICHAEL
Everything will be answered in due time,

They stroll down a beautifully manicured path. There are a
lot of flowers, and a lot of fountains. WENDY, dressed
similarly to Michael (they look like a Four Seasons Hotel
Staff), waves and smiles.
WENDY
Hi Michael!
MICHAEL
Morning Wendy! Happy birthday!

She would have been 3800 years old today.

I’m just kidding, it’s not a giant
lizard.
Whew!

ELEANOR

MICHAEL
Sorry, that’s my little joke. But no,
I’m just a sort of...helper, I guess
you’d say. My job was to design this
Neighborhood. The Good Place is divided
up into distinct “Neighborhoods,” each
one containing exactly 334 people.
Why 334?

ELEANOR

MICHAEL
(waving it off)
It’s just -- it’s the perfect number of
people, trust me, we’re omniscient.

a blissful harmonic balance.
Wow.

ELEANOR

There’s a lot of frozen yogurt places.
MICHAEL
Yeah, every neighborhood has those.
People love frozen yogurt. I don’t know
what to tell you.
EXT. MAIN SQUARE - LATER
A smallish PUBLIC SQUARE, with a STAGE. PEOPLE mill around
excitedly. Eleanor sits down on one of many CHAIRS as
Michael walks on the STAGE and waves to them, humbly.
MICHAEL
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your
first day in the afterlife! You were

good lives. But how do we know that you

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Poison a river with deadly chemicals? Uh
oh -- that’s negative 4610! But it’s not
only big things: every sandwich you ate,
every time you bought a magazine...Every
single thing you did created some amount
of bad or good -- intentionally or
accidentally -- and it counted.
ON SCREEN: Good Person is now in a COFFIN, looking peaceful.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
When your time on Earth ends, we
calculate the total value of your life.
The measuring system is too complex for
you to understand, but trust me, it’s
perfectly accurate.
ON SCREEN: We pull back to see MANY PEOPLE in COFFINS.
NUMBERS are calculated on screen, for each, plusses and
minuses, rapidly. Good Person’s number ends the highest:

Only the people with the very highest
scores -- the true cream of the crop -get to come here...to the Good Place!

Everyone else goes to the Bad Place to be
tortured for eternity.

So! You are here because you lived one
of the very best lives that could be
lived.
ON SCREEN: All the people disappear except Good Person, who
floats into a WHITE ROOM; on the wall is written, in green:
THE GOOD PLACE.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Now you will reap the rewards of that
good life. And you won’t be alone! Your
true soulmate is here too!

soulmates will spend eternity together!

COUPLES -- some same-sex, some opposite-sex -- who all hold
hands and smile to camera.
IN CROWD: Eleanor looks over at JIANYU, a handsome East Asian
guy. She smiles at him, and he smiles back...

People APPLAUD.

Eleanor looks happy.

EXT. ELEANOR’S STREET - LATER
Michael and Eleanor walk down the sidewalk.
ELEANOR
So, who’s in hell, that would shock me?
MICHAEL
Again, it’s not “hell” in the ancient
Christian sense -ELEANOR
Right right right.

Who’s down there?

Ooh, you know who surprised me?

Einstein.
Really.

ELEANOR

MICHAEL
Yeah. All of his theories are wrong and
it’s set physics back like 1000 years.
If Einstein had never been born, humans
would have jetpacks by now.
ELEANOR
I knew there had to be a reason we didn’t
have jetpacks!

All those amazing people...down there.
Hard to believe.
MICHAEL
Again, it’s an incredibly selective
system. Most people don’t make it here.
But you: a veterinarian, human rights
activist, a loving daughter and
sister...you’re special, Eleanor.

By the way: welcome to your new home!
They are in front of a SMALL, NICE MODERN HOME.
Wow.

ELEANOR
So...who built this?

You built this. It came into existence

ELEANOR
That’s beautiful. And I guess it’s why
my house, for example, is a cozy little
cottage, while some other houses might be
bigger. Like that one.

We WIDEN to see: the house next door is an ENORMOUS SCARFACESTYLE MANSION, with BELLAGIO-TYPE FOUNTAINS in front.
MICHAEL

Exactly! You get it.

Let’s head inside!

INT. ELEANOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
They walk in. It’s small and minimally decorated, in a
modern/Danish way, all clean lines and right angles.
MICHAEL
As you can see, the interior has been
decorated just as you like it, in the
Scandanavian minimalist style...
Her gestures to a wall featuring PAINTINGS of CLOWNS.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
-- and obviously you also love clowns!
ELEANOR
(happy)
I do love clowns!
MICHAEL
Right! If you loved sailing, these would
be paintings of sailboats.
ELEANOR
Kind of makes me wish I had loved
something besides clowns. Like naked
Channing Tatum.
Michael laughs.

want to move in together, obviously you

Someone forked up. Forked. Why can’t I

don’t lie. I’m gonna tell Michael. It’s
the right thing to do.
He starts to walk after Michael.

She grabs his arm--

ELEANOR
(quietly)
Just...hang on, before you go ratting me
out to the feds, remember: you promised
you would never do anything to hurt me.
And unlike me, you're a good person, so
you have to keep your promises! Ha!
Gotcha!
Chidi realizes she is right, and clutches his stomach...
CHIDI
It’s getting worse. The stomach ache is
getting worse. I feel like my soul is
being strangled.
Eleanor pats him on the back.
ELEANOR
All right, buddy. Walk it off.

We walk in BEHIND Eleanor and Chidi, now dressed for a

gestures to her
ELEANOR
Sweet dress, right? Got Janet to fetch
it for me. Instant, on-demand,
everything free! This place is the best!
Now let’s go lie to some saints!
He looks pained.
CHIDI
Help me out. Tell me something good
about yourself, that I can hang on to.
What happened... the day before you died?
Off Eleanor’s look...
FLASHBACK - INT. ELEANOR’S CAR - MORNING - TWO DAYS AGO
She is pulling out of a TIGHT PARKING SPACE.
SCRAPE of metal on metal, winces.

She hears a

EXT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER
She sees that she has SCRAPED the car next to her. She
thinks. Then grabs a pen and writes a NOTE, leaving it on
the windshield.
EXT. CAR - LATER
The OWNER of the car comes back, sees the scrape and the
note. He reads it -ANGLE ON NOTE:
It reads: “YOU PARKED TOO CLOSE TO THE LINE. THIS IS ON YOU.”
The guy looks around like “what the hell?”

Eleanor is still thinking...
ELEANOR
...Don’t remember anything specific.
Look, maybe I wasn’t a saint or anything,

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
I never found a wallet outside an IHOP
and thought about returning it but then
saw that the owner lived in another state
and just took the cash and dropped the
wallet back on the ground.
CHIDI
...That’s very specific, and it makes me
think you definitely did do that.
ELEANOR
All I’m saying is, these people might be
“good,” but are they really that much
better than me?

INT. TEHANI/JIANYU’S HOUSE - LATER - MONTAGE
They talk with PAMELA and BONG-CHA (Korean).
BONG-CHA
-- That’s when I knew I had to spend my
life fighting for women’s rights in North
Korea. I knew I’d be jailed for it, but
that seemed a small price to pay.
PAMELA
What did you do for a living, Eleanor?
ELEANOR
Oh -- long story. I’m headed to the bar - would you like anything?
She scuttles off.
INT. TEHANI/JIANYU’S HOUSE - LATER - MONTAGE CONT’D
Eleanor talks to RACHEL -RACHEL
-- so we said, “If the U.N. won’t remove
those landmines, we will.” And we
personally dug up more than a thousand
unexploded mines from the area
surrounding the orphanage.

be reversed.” It was a simple decision,

ELEANOR
Wowwwwww that is so amazing!

Hey Janet?
Janet APPEARS behind her.
Hi there!

JANET
How can I help?

ELEANOR
I’ve had eight glasses of wine and I feel
nothing. Can you not get drunk here?
It’s suddenly very important that I get
drunk.
JANET
Our default setting is that alcohol has
no effect. If you want it to affect you,

ELEANOR
On it. Thanks.

There’s been a lot of bad high school
productions of “Midsummer.” Caused a lot
of agony. Anyway: you all know that I’m
the architect of this Neighborhood. What
you don’t know is: this is the very first
Neighborhood I’ve ever designed! I’ve
been an apprentice for a while now -about 300 years -- and my bosses finally
gave me my first solo project.
He gestures around him.

Everyone APPLAUDS.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
For that reason, it’s very special to me,
and I want it to be perfect. You deserve
a perfect world. Because you are all -every one of you -- good people! So if
you have any problems at all -- which you
won’t! -Everyone LAUGHS.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
-- come see me, personally. My door is
always open. Back to the party!
Everyone CLAPS.
TEHANI
Bravo, Michael! Bravo!
Eleanor turns to Chidi.
ELEANOR
Ugh, Tehani -- what a condescending
birch. Why does she still have a British
accent? No one else has an accent -- she
is choosing to have that accent!

“Hell-oooo everyone! I’m utterly perfect
and I look like a cartoon princess!”

Okay, maybe it’s time to head home.
She SLURPS DOWN the rest of her drink as he ushers her away.

She lies down.

He starts to leave.

ELEANOR (CONT’D)
Chidi, Chidi -- wait. I’m sorry.

I’m sorry for dragging you into this.
It’s not fair that your first day in
paradise is babysitting a drunk moron.
It’s okay.

CHIDI

ELEANOR
It’s not, though.
(sigh)
Do you think anyone cared that I died?
Maybe some people did, I dunno. I’m an
only child. My parents are both
dead...they were good people, so they’re
prolly in one of the other “Good Person”
Neighborhoods, like having sex with each
other.

Bleccch. Gross. Keep it in your pants,

She suddenly is DRINKING more wine.

Eleanor stumbles outside to see: houses cut in HALF. TREES
are UPSIDE-DOWN or TWISTED INTO PRETZELS. In the sky, jagged
SLASHES of RED LIGHTNING criss-cross in every direction.
PEOPLE mill around, confused. Everyone’s CLOTHES are now
BLUE and YELLOW STRIPES. Tehani walks past Eleanor, dazed...
because her HEAD is where her BUTT should be.
TEHANI

Chidi sits in disbelief.

ELEANOR
Okay: we don’t know that this is because
of me. I’m not perfect, but these people
aren’t either. A lot of them brag about
how “amazing” they were... Tehani is
totally condescending... that one guy had
a gross ear!
CHIDI
No one said they were perfect. But they
spent their lives thinking about other
people, helping other people, doing good.
ELEANOR
Ah, but here’s the point: if I’m not the
only one with flaws, how can we be sure
all this is my fault?
CHIDI
You called Tehani a butthead and now she
has a head on her butt.
...Fair.

ELEANOR
That’s a fair point.

CHIDI
This perfect utopia has been corrupted by
one rotten apple. And after your boorish
”performance” last night, it’s pretty
clear you’re that apple.

Hey, I was fine at that party! Name one

unethical.
