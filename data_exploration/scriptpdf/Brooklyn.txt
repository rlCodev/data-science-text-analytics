EXT. STREET. PRE-DAWN

1

A quiet, working-class residential street in Ireland, early
1950s. It’s morning, but it’s still dark. One of the front
doors opens, and out slips EILIS - early twenties, open-faced
pretty without knowing it. She closes the door quietly behind
her and walks quickly up the street.
There is a hissed call from behind her. She turns, and her
sister ROSE - thirty, attractive, slender, pale - is running
after her, in nightdress and bare feet, holding out a piece
of bread and jam. Eilis takes it from her, makes a face to
show how grateful she is.
EILIS
(mouthing)
Go back to bed.
Rose nods, tiptoes back to the house.

INT. CHURCH. DAY

2

It’s the early mass, and the church has only a smattering of
worshippers. Eilis is kneeling and praying with two other
women: MISS KELLY, fifties, thick glasses, a constant look of
disapproval on her face, and MARY, the same age as Eilis, but
large and simple-minded - her mouth is usually open,
indicating her lack of comprehension at more or less any
given moment. Eilis yawns. Miss Kelly shoots her a look.
Chastened, Eilis stifles the yawn and looks fixedly ahead.
3

EXT. KELLY SHOP STREET. DAY

3

Finally, there is weak daylight. Mary and Eilis wait while
Miss Kelly finds her keys and opens the side-door to her
shop. This is clearly not a normal morning for Eilis - she
has something on her mind. She watches Miss Kelly carefully,
trying to judge the right moment to speak to her. The door
opens, Mary walks into the shop, leaving Miss Kelly and Eilis
bringing up the rear.
EILIS
(suddenly)
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you
later?
MISS KELLY
Not if what you’re going to say
will cause trouble for me in some
way or another.
End of conversation. Eilis closes her eyes for a moment,
fearful of the confrontation to come.

INT. KELLY SHOP. DAY

4

Miss Kelly turns on the light, and we see the shop for the
first time. It’s a well-stocked, and well-kept, grocery
store, but it almost certainly hasn’t changed since the
1920s. Eilis walks to the back of the shop to collect the
bread, which has obviously been there since the previous day,
and places it on the counter. While Miss Kelly takes a piece
of long, yellow paper out of its packet, Mary places a ladder
carefully under the old piece, which is stuck to the ceiling
and covered with the bodies of dead flies.
Later. A male customer is buying a single cigarette from
Eilis. Miss Kelly is peering through the shop window from an
angle.
MISS KELLY
The nine o’clock mass is over,
girls. Here they come.
Later. The shop is packed - customers standing three or four
deep at the counter. Eilis and Mary are coping as best they
can; Miss Kelly is directing them, in a way designed to cause
maximum resentment. Miss Kelly spies a well-dressed woman
standing well back, and smiles at her.
MISS KELLY
Mrs Brady, what would you like this
morning?
MRS BRADY
Half-a-dozen rashers, please.
MISS KELLY
Of course. Eilis will get that for
you now.
Eilis is about to serve a shabbier woman standing right in
front of the counter. Eilis looks at her helplessly.
SHABBY WOMAN
(aggrieved)
I was next.
MISS KELLY
And you still are. Mary, if you
serve Mr O’Leary back there, will
you make a mess of it? I suppose
you will. Let’s see.
Mary is stung by the barb. Miss Kelly doesn’t notice and
doesn’t care anyway.
MARY
Mr O’Leary?

(CONTINUED)

Mr O’Leary, like Mrs Brady, is well towards the back of the
scrum. Miss Kelly’s favouritism seems designed to cause
resentment and frustration, but the customers seem used to
her arbitrary treatment of them, and there are no outward
signs of dissent. Miss Kelly turns her attention to a timidlooking woman standing right in front of her.
Yes?

MISS KELLY

TIMID WOMAN
(quietly)
I need some shoe polish.
MISS KELLY
Shoe polish? Ah, but that’s not
really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their
dinner or their tea. Why couldn’t
you have remembered yesterday?
Miss Kelly leans over the counter to stare at the timid
woman’s shoes. The timid woman stares at the counter,
humiliated.
MISS KELLY
Because it looks like you needed it
yesterday.
I’m sorry.

TIMID WOMAN

Miss Kelly sighs deeply, shakes her head, and goes to find
the offending item.
5

INT. KELLY SHOP. LATE AFTERNOON

5

Miss Kelly locks the door of the shop behind the last
customer. Eilis stops tidying up and waits until the door is
locked before speaking.
EILIS
Miss Kelly...
MISS KELLY
(tetchy)
I hadn’t forgotten. Spit it out,
whatever it is.
EILIS
I’m..I’m away to America.
Miss Kelly likes to think she knows everything, but this
gives her pause. She soon recovers.

MISS KELLY
(scornful)
Whose idea was that?
EILIS
Father Flood in New York arranged
it. Rose used to play golf with
him, when he lived here. He
sponsored me. He... he found me a
job, and got me a visa, and..
MISS KELLY
Well, we won’t be needing you back
here.
EILIS
I don’t sail for a month. I could
work every Sunday until I go.
MISS KELLY
I shall want to train a new girl up
straight away.
EILIS
But I could help.
MISS KELLY
No, thank you.
She starts to turn her back on Eilis, but she has one last
thing to say.
MISS KELLY
Your poor sister.
EILIS
(surprised)
My sister?
MISS KELLY
Oh, mothers are always being left
behind in this country. But
Rose...That’s the end for her,
isn’t it? She’ll be looking after
your mother for the rest of her
life.
This time she does turn her back and walk away.

EXT. NANCY’S HOUSE. NIGHT

6

Eilis is knocking at the door of a house not dissimilar to
her own. She scarcely has time to complete a second knock,
and the door flies open.

(CONTINUED)

Her friend NANCY, already wearing her coat, smiles at Eilis,
pulls the door shut behind her, and starts walking off down
the street with Eilis trailing in her wake.
7

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

7

Nancy and Eilis walking arm-in-arm down the street. Now we
can get a chance to look at Nancy properly: she’s
staggeringly pretty, film-star pretty. It helps that she’s
dressed up and made up to go out - Eilis looks a little wan
by comparison, even though she’s made an effort too - but
even so, she’s a stunner.
EILIS
You look beautiful, Nancy.
Thank you.

NANCY

EILIS
You look so beautiful it makes me
despair of this place.
Nancy laughs.
Why?

NANCY

EILIS
You’re the prettiest girl in County
Wexford. You should be able to
choose any man you want. And we’re
hoping that George Sheridan from
the rugby club looks your way.
The scornful way she emphasises the social institution
suggests that she doesn’t think he’s much of a catch.
NANCY
(sufficiently excited to
miss the point)
Do you think he might?
EILIS
Of course he will. I know you like
him, Nancy, but he’s not Gary
Cooper, is he? And those boys, with
their hair-oil and their blazers..
She shudders her distaste.
NANCY
He has beautiful eyes.

EILIS
And he’s going to come into a
beautiful shop in the Market
Square.
NANCY
(changing the subject)
Why didn’t you wear your blue
dress?
Now it is Eilis’s turn to look a little discomfited.
EILIS
Are you asking why I didn’t make
more of an effort?

They have reached the small hall where the dance they are
attending is taking place. They join a small queue to get in all girls.
NANCY
What if one of the boys from the
rugby club asked you to dance?
Wouldn’t you like the pleasure of
telling him it’s too late?
They laugh.
8

INT. DANCE HALL. NIGHT

8

Nancy and Eilis are leaning against the wall sipping
lemonades. There aren’t many men this early in the evening,
and the dance-floor is almost deserted. Suddenly there is a
buzz from the girls scattered around the place. Eilis’s eyes
are drawn to the same place as everyone else’s: to the door.
A group of young men, dressed almost identically, and just as
Eilis described - blazers and hair-oil - are coming in. One
of them is JIM, who we will meet much later.
These young men exude a confidence bordering on arrogance they’re hard to like en masse - and consequently the uniform
looks slightly sinister. They ignore everyone in the room and
make their way to the soft drinks bar. Eilis rolls her eyes.
Nancy is blushing.
Later. Nancy and Eilis are still waiting. Eilis is watching
the rugby club boys, Nancy is looking anywhere but. The
camera picks out George, who is tall, confident, as oily as
his friends - and no Gary Cooper.
EILIS
He’s looked over here twice
already.
He hasn’t!

NANCY

EILIS
He’s walking over here now.
NANCY
(still looking the other
way)
He’s not!
He is. We see him. Nancy, however, still has her back to him.
EILIS
(impatient)
Why would I keep lying to you about
what George Sheridan’s doing?

(CONTINUED)

George arrives. He nods at Nancy.
GEORGE
Would you like to dance?
Nancy is almost too nervous to nod her head.
Moments later. George and Nancy on the dance floor. Over
their shoulders the camera picks up Eilis, making her way
towards the door, holding her coat. A couple of the rugby
clubbers whisper and snigger as they watch her leave.
9

INT. DINING ROOM, EILIS’S HOUSE. EVENING

9

It’s Eilis’s last night at home. Eilis, her mother MARY and
her sister Rose, are eating, initially in silence. The sound
of cutlery hitting crockery only serves to emphasise the
tension and the sadness of the evening. Eilis keeps sneaking
glances at the rest of her family, trying to gauge how
unhappy they are.
There’s no outward trace. Rose and her mother are both
concentrating on their food, determined to give nothing away.
Eventually Eilis has to say what is on her mind.
EILIS
(quietly)
I wish I had written to Father
Flood about you, Rose.
ROSE
Me? I have a job. You had a couple
of hours on a Sunday working for
Nettles Kelly.
MARY
(mildly disapproving)
You shouldn’t call her that.
ROSE
I think it’s quite a kind name.
Considering she’s actually a
terrible old witch.
Mary makes a scandalised face.
EILIS
I don’t want to spend my last
evening talking about her.
Good.

ROSE

But nobody knows what they do want to talk about.

MARY
They say it’s hotter there in the
summer, and colder in the winter.
Mary puts her knife and fork down despairingly.
MARY
(with deep but clearly
displaced anxiety)
What in Heaven’s name will she do
about clothes?
ROSE
She’ll buy them, mother.
MARY
She doesn’t want to be wasting her
money on clothes.
ROSE
She won’t have much choice. She’ll
be there...
She stops herself from finishing the sentence. An even deeper
and unhappier silence falls on the table.
10

INT. EILIS’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

10

Close on an old and very large suitcase. It’s about twothirds full of Eilis’s things. Pull back to show Rose and
Eilis peering into it.
EILIS
(wry)
There. It wasn’t so hard to decide
after all.
ROSE
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis. I should have looked
after you better. I should have
taken you shopping twice a year,
summer and winter.
EILIS
You’ve bought most of the clothes
in this case. That’s one of the
reasons I’m going, because I can’t
buy my own.
ROSE
If it was just that, I’d spend
every penny I had on you, gladly.
But I can’t buy you a future. I
can’t buy you the kind of life you
need.

EILIS
(whispers)
I know. (Beat) But you’ll come to
see me there one day?
Yes.

ROSE

EILIS
And you’ll look after yourself?
ROSE
You don’t have to worry about me.
EILIS
And I’ll come home to visit, won’t
I? Because I couldn’t bear it if...
Rose has to stop this, because she can’t bear it either.
ROSE
You haven’t packed your shoes yet.
They’ll take up a bit of room.
11

EXT. LINER. DAY

11

Eilis is wedged at the deck-rail of a large passenger liner,
along with a lot of other emigres, her large suitcase in
front of her. Among the crowd on the dock below her are Rose
and Mary. There are a lot of tears, from passengers and the
people they are leaving behind. Rose and Mary, however, like
Eilis, are keeping everything in. The ship blasts its horn to
announce its imminent departure; everyone jumps and laughs
nervously, and the waving becomes more frantic. Rose and
Mary, however, suddenly turn away from the boat and push
through the crowd. Rose looks back helplessly and blows Eilis
a kiss. Eilis watches the backs of the two of them until they
disappear out of sight.
12

INT. STAIRCASE, LINER. DAY

12

Eilis bumps her case down the narrow steps deep in the bowels
of the boat. She reaches a corridor and examines the sign on
the wall directing passengers to their berths. She has to
descend still deeper into the boat.
13

INT. CABIN. DAY

13

Eilis’s cabin is tiny and windowless, and she has to share it
with someone: there are two bunk beds. She wedges her
suitcase into an available space.
She opens the bathroom door. The bathroom is tiny. It
contains a toilet and a sink.
(CONTINUED)

13

'Brooklyn' YELLOW Script Dated 24th April 2014

13

There is another door, apparently leading into the next
cabin. A sign on the door says ‘UNLOCK WHEN NOT IN USE’.
Eilis pushes it open and sees two middle-aged women
unpacking.
Sorry.

EILIS

She shuts it again quickly. She doesn’t know what to do, so
lies down on the bottom bunk with her hands behind her head,
staring. She closes her eyes, but suddenly the cabin door
bursts open and a glamorous blonde, late thirties, bustles in
to the room with a large trunk. This is GEORGINA, her cabinmate.
Off!

GEORGINA

Eilis sits up and stares at her, uncomprehending. Georgina
waves a ticket at her.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
Number one. Bottom bunk. That’s
mine. You’re on the top.
Eilis scrambles up the ladder to her bed. She can’t sit up the ceiling is too low - so she has to lie down, and is
therefore unable to make eye-contact with Georgina throughout
the scene.
GEORGINA
This is hell. Never again.
EILIS
(trying to be friendly)
Never again to America?
GEORGINA
The mistake was coming home from
America in the first place. I’d do
anything to get out of this
horrible cabin, and I mean
anything. Let’s go for a smoke.
I don’t.

EILIS

Georgina rolls her eyes.
GEORGINA
Suit yourself. I’ll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First
to smoke with.
She bustles out.

INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT

10A.
14

Eilis is on her own in the Third Class dining room. She is
eating a plate of very brown and very unappetising-looking
mutton stew. She eats as much as she can, although a lot of
the meat is gristle, which she has to extract from her mouth
with a napkin, as discreetly as possible.

(CONTINUED)

14

She finishes, dabs her mouth with the napkin. The underemployed waiter comes over immediately to clear away her
plate.
WAITER
It’s good to see that not
everybody’s put off their dinner by
the weather forecast.
Eilis looks at him blankly.
WAITER (CONT’D)
(cheerful)
It’s supposed to be a rough one
tonight, so none of the other
passengers are eating. A few
spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not
the mutton stew.
Comprehension dawns. Eilis looks stricken.
15

INT. CABIN. NIGHT

15

Eilis is standing in her nightgown, clutching her toothbrush
and toothpaste. She is waiting outside the locked bathroom.
She taps on the door. Nothing. She waits a few moments. She
puts her ear to the door, but the only noise comes from the
ships engines - in Third Class, a loud, deep constant. She
grimaces suddenly, and closes her eyes. She’s sweating. She
knocks on the bathroom door again.
EILIS
(to the door)
Oh, please unlock it.
She can’t wait any longer. She stumbles out into the corridor
looking for a toilet...
16

INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT

16

...Nothing. She tries to go upstairs to the Second Class
cabins, but the door at the bottom of the stairs is locked.
She’s desperate now. In an alcove of the corridor, she sees a
mop and bucket. She picks up the bucket, ready to throw up in
it - but as soon as she does so, she realises that her
problems are at the other end. She puts the bucket on the
floor, squats over it. She looks around desperately for
something to wipe herself with, but there is only the mop.
She hates herself, and everything that has led to her being
here. She starts to throw up.

'Brooklyn' YELLOW Script Dated 24th April 2014
17

INT. CABIN. NIGHT

12.
17

Eilis comes back in, holding the mop and the bucket. She
knocks on the bathroom door again. No answer, but this time
she hears the sound of retching. She pukes into the bucket.
For a moment there is a little contrapuntal symphony of
retching.
18

INT. CABIN. DAY

18

Eilis is asleep on the bottom bunk. Close on her face - greentinged, sweaty. A hand touches her face, and Eilis opens her
eyes. It’s Georgina.
EILIS
I’m so sorry about the smell. And
the bucket.
GEORGINA
(gently)
Oh, don’t worry. The whole boat
stinks. Even First Class. I’ve just
been thrown out of there, by the
way, so you’ll have me throwing up
in here too.
EILIS
The bathroom door was locked all
night.
GEORGINA
(angry on Eilis’s behalf)
Oh, those bastards. That’s what
people do. They keep the bathroom
for themselves on rough nights.
We’ll fix them.
She fishes in a handbag and finds a nail-file. Deftly, she
unlocks the bathroom door. There’s nobody in there. Quickly,
she pulls her trunk into the bathroom and jams it against the
door on the other side. There is now no room in front of the
toilet.
GEORGINA
It won’t be very comfortable. But
at least it’s ours now.
They smile at each other. Almost immediately there is a
furious knocking on the bathroom door. Georgina hurls herself
against the door with a fury.
GEORGINA
Fuck off! Do you hear me? Fuck off!
If you’d been nice last night, we
would have played fair.

GEORGINA (CONT'D)
But now you’ve got no toilet for
five days, you bastards.

Eilis laughs, and then winces.
GEORGINA
Go on, you can use it. I’m going to
get us some water. That’s all
you’re allowed. You’ll bring it all
up again, but you won’t feel so
bad. And you’ll be right as rain
after a night’s sleep.
19

INT. CABIN. DAY

19

Georgina comes into the cabin. Eilis emerges from the shower,
drying herself. She’s looking better.
GEORGINA
(mock-dramatic)
We have a peace treaty.
EILIS
With next door?
GEORGINA
Yes. They have given their solemn
word never to lock the bathroom
door when they’re not using it.
They know they’re out of their
depth with me.
The women smile at each other.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
Are you going to America to live?
Yes.

EILIS

GEORGINA
You have papers and everything?
EILIS
Yes. And a job.
GEORGINA
You have family there?
No.

EILIS

sometimes it’s nice to meet people
who don’t know your auntie. Just
every now and again.
20

EXT. DECK. DAY

20

Eilis and Georgina are leaning on the rails of the thirdclass deck, looking out to sea.
EILIS
I haven’t been sick for hours.
GEORGINA
It’s nice, isn’t it?
EILIS
I’m very hungry.
GEORGINA
That’s why you haven’t been sick
for hours. We can eat soon. Maybe
tomorrow.
21

INT. CANTEEN. NIGHT

21

Georgina and Eilis eating in the canteen. The journey is
nearly over, so there are more diners now. Both women look
tired and pale. Georgina studies Eilis.
GEORGINA
Oh, dear. We’ll have to do
something with you. They’ll put you
in quarantine or something if you
try to enter the country looking
like that.
22

INT. CABIN. NIGHT

Georgina is pulling clothes out of Eilis’s case.
GEORGINA
Nothing fancy. You mustn’t look

She finds a white dress with a red floral pattern.
GEORGINA (CONT’D)
That’s not too bad.
EILIS
My sister gave me that.
GEORGINA
Wear it with this...
She finds a plain cardigan.
And this.

GEORGINA (CONT’D)

She pulls out a plain scarf.
23

INT. IMMIGRATION CENTRE. DAY

23

Eilis is in the queue to get in to the immigration centre,
looking anxiously ahead of her. Her compatriots, men and
women and children, are all around her. She is wearing makeup, and she looks very different - much less naive.
Over her shoulder, we see A VISTA OF THE MANHATTAN SKYLINE.
Eilis stares at it for a little while, wide-eyed.
GEORGINA (V.O.)
Don’t look too innocent. I’ll put
some rouge and mascara on you. And
perhaps some eye-liner.
24

INT. IMMIGRATION CENTRE. DAY

24

Eilis inside, approaching the officials. We watch with her as
a family is in the process of being turned away: a man, his
wife, a toddler and a baby. The woman (and baby) are crying,
the man distraught. They are clearly poor: the man’s boots
have holes in them.
GEORGINA (V.O.)
Polish your shoes, and don’t cough,
whatever you do. And stand up
straight.
Eilis remembers to stand tall. She’s looking at all the
people around her, and the hard-luck stories they represent.

A few minutes later. Eilis is showing her papers to the
official.
GEORGINA (V.O.)
Don’t be rude, or pushy, but don’t
look nervous.
It’s as if Eilis remembers the advice even as we’re hearing
it: she suddenly lifts her eyes from the official’s shoulders
towards a point ahead of him - towards America.
GEORGINA (V.O.)
Think like an American. You have to
know where you’re going.
The official hands Eilis her papers back and ushers her
through. She walks towards the light on the other side, and
suddenly the sun blanches out everything; we just see a
silhouette, walking into nowhere.
25

EXT. MRS. KEHOE’S STREET. EARLY EVENING

25

Eilis is struggling with her suitcase down a dimly-lit
Brooklyn residential street.
26

INT. DINING ROOM, MRS. KEHOE’S HOUSE. EVENING

26

Round a dining table in a basement kitchen are five girls,
including Eilis, and a middle-aged lady. This is the
impeccably-dressed landlady of Eilis’s lodging-house in
Brooklyn, MRS KEHOE. The girls are standing and holding
hands, while Mrs Kehoe says grace, so we get a good look at
them.
Two of the girls - PATTY and DIANA - are young and
attractive. Patty is the only native American in the house the rest are Irish. Patty and Diana are a double-act, firm
friends and quick to defend each other. SHEILA is older,
glamorous in a femme fatale way, with a chequered history.
There is constant tension between Patty and Diana on one side
and Sheila on the other. MISS MCADAM is prim, plain,
bespectacled, severe-looking and from Belfast.
MRS KEHOE
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy
gifts which we are about to receive
from thy bounty through Christ our
Lord, Amen.
Amen.

MISS MCADAM

Patty and Diana exchange glances and try not to laugh at Miss
McAdam’s piety. Everyone sits down to eat.

MRS KEHOE
I saw you had a letter today,
Diana. Any news?
DIANA
Mr de Valera has had another
operation on his eyes, she says.
He’s been in Holland.
MRS KEHOE
(dismissively)
I don’t want news I can read in a
newspaper.
SHEILA
(artfully)
Anyway, we would describe Mr de
Valera as “politics”, would we not,
Mrs Kehoe? And we do not like
politics at the dinner table.
Her firmness is parodic - she’s making fun of Mrs Kehoe, who
seems not to notice.
We don’t.

MRS KEHOE

DIANA
(aggrieved)
It’s not politics, to talk about
eye operations.
MRS KEHOE
It is if the eyes belong to a
politician. And I don’t like to
talk about hospitals very much,
either. Patty, have you had any
luck with that cold cream?
PATTY
No, Mrs Kehoe. It still hasn’t come
in. I asked Miss Tyler in
Cosmetics. And I showed her the
advertisement.
MRS KEHOE
I don’t want to have to travel all
the way to Manhattan for a jar of
cold cream. Maybe you could have a
look in Bartocci’s for me, Eilis?
EILIS
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
SHEILA
Oh, Bartocci’s is bound to have it.

Patty rolls her eyes.
DIANA
She doesn’t know for sure, Mrs
Kehoe. She’s saying that Bartocci’s
is a better store than Webster’s,
just to get at Patty.
MRS KEHOE
They’re both very good, and you
girls are lucky to be working
there. Eilis, from the look of you,
you have greasy skin, is that
right? What do you do about that?
EILIS
(embarrassed)
Just...Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe.
With soap.
MISS MCADAM
There’s nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for Our Lord.
I expect.
MRS KEHOE
And which brand did he use, Miss
McAdam? Does the Bible tell you
that?
DIANA
And our Lord was a man, anyway. He
didn’t care about greasy skin.
Mrs Kehoe shakes her head in disbelief.
MRS KEHOE
(sternly)
Ladies. No more talk about Our
Lord’s complexion at dinner,
please. (Beat) Girls, you will help
Eilis find something suitable,
won’t you?
There are enthusiastic murmurings of consent. Eilis tries to
look pleased.

INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT

27

Eilis in the dark in her small bedroom, trying to sleep. It’s
hot, and the house is alive with noise, even late at night.
There are footsteps on the ceiling above her, and the sound
of a lavatory chain flushing through the wall. Down the
hallway, there is the sound of a whispered conversation
between two of the girls. Eilis gives up on sleep, opens her
eyes properly and stares at the ceiling.

The camera picks Eilis out in the bustle of people. She’s
waiting to cross the road; on the other side is Bartocci’s,
the department store where she works.

INT. STAFF ROOM, BARTOCCI’S. DAY

Eilis takes her clock card from the holder in the wall, puts
it in the machine, waits for the heavy thud of the punch,
puts the card back in the holder. She walks to her locker,
puts on the blue uniform that all the female shop assistants
wear. As she changes, a colleague, DOROTHY - the same age as
Eilis, but chattier, - and cattier - starts to change at the
locker next to hers.
Hi.

DOROTHY

EILIS
Good morning.
They change in silence for a couple of moments.
DOROTHY
Did you go out last night?
Eilis looks at her blankly. Dorothy laughs.
DOROTHY
Out. The opposite of in.
No.

EILIS

DOROTHY
I went to see a movie with my
boyfriend.
Eilis carries on changing. Dorothy becomes exasperated by
Eilis’s lack of engagement, and embarks on both sides of the
conversation.
DOROTHY
“What did you see, Dorothy?” “I saw
‘The Quiet Man’, Eilis. They filmed
it in Ireland.” “Oh, I’m from
Ireland.” “I know you are. That’s
why I thought you might be
interested.”

INT. BARTOCCI’S. DAY

32

Close on a small metal case with a hinged door on one end. We
see Eilis’s hand putting cash and a docket into the holder,
and closing the door. Eilis pushes the holder firmly into a
tube, and it whizzes up to the ceiling.
The camera follows the tube system a little way and then
pulls back, to reveal the women’s department of a beautiful
1950s department store in all its quiet, dignified splendour lots of dark wood, lots of lovingly-arranged items of
clothing. Very few of us have ever seen, or can remember
properly, a store like this, but we ache for its loss anyway.
Eilis is standing behind the counter, smiling pleasantly at a
customer, a middle-aged white woman.
EILIS
Shouldn’t be a moment.
They wait in silence. A few yards away, and unnoticed by
Eilis initially, stands Eilis’s supervisor MISS FORTINI thirtysomething, utterly devoted to the store. She’s watching
Eilis carefully.
Finally Eilis spots her. Miss Fortini clearly makes her
uncomfortable. Eilis tries to maker herself look busy. She
puts the stocking that the woman has bought into a bag, and
then starts to write something down on a docket. Unseen by
the customer, Miss Fortini tells Eilis in mime to speak and
to smile. Eilis freezes even more. Miss Fortini steps towards
her.
EILIS
(in a rush)
Is it still hot out there? I
haven’t been outside since this
morning but I can tell that it
might be. Very. It just..looks it.
She ends this awkward little speech with a forced smile, but
it’s enough to ward off Miss Fortini, who switches her
attention elsewhere for a moment, to Eilis’s visible relief.
CUSTOMER
It’s warm, yes.

The metal tube returns with a whoosh and a clank. Eilis
extracts the change and the docket, and hands both to the
customer. The moment she has gone, Miss Fortini returns.
MISS FORTINI
Remember: if people like it here,
they’ll come back.
Eilis nods, as if Miss Fortini has said something deep, or
interesting.
MISS FORTINI
So you treat every customer as if
she’s a new friend. Is that a deal?
I’ll try.

EILIS

MISS FORTINI
(gently)
It’s not a matter of trying. It’s
what you have to do. (Beat) Do you
try to wear panties every day?
The analogy is slightly off, inappropriate, and Eilis is
thrown for a moment.
EILIS
No. I mean, I don’t try. I..I just
put them on.
MISS FORTINI
You see what I’m saying?
Yes.
Good.

EILIS

INT. DINER. DAY

33

Lunch time. While Eilis eats her grilled cheese sandwich at
the counter, she watches her fellow diners - male colleagues
smoking and joking, girlfriends talking animatedly, people on
their own reading the newspaper. Everyone seems to know what
they’re doing there except Eilis - everyone seems comfortable
in their own skin, absorbed in their environment. Eilis looks
anxious and uncomfortable and lost. She finishes her
sandwich, swallows as quickly as she can, catches the eye of
the young, handsome waiter.
EILIS
Could I have the bill please?

WAITER
See you tomorrow, sweetheart.
Eilis gives a quick, thin smile and walks out.

The girls and Mrs Kehoe are eating dinner, in exactly the
same formation as the first time we saw them.
MRS KEHOE
Have they told you a date for the
nylon sale yet, Eilis? We’ve never
had a Bartocci’s girl living here.
(She taps her nose) We may get some
inside information.
EILIS
I haven’t been told anything.
PATTY
I’ll bet you wouldn’t let on if you
had.
DIANA
She’s that sort. More loyal to her
bosses than to her friends.
PATTY
Like a Red spy.
Eilis is flustered.
SHEILA

Oh, dear God.
MRS KEHOE
I’ll thank you to keep His name out

MRS KEHOE
I was glad to see you finally got
some letters from home today,
Eilis.
Eilis looks up from her plate as if electrocuted.
EILIS
Did I? I..I forgot to check.
She half-stands - she can’t wait.
MRS KEHOE
They’ll still be there after
dinner.
EILIS
Oh. Yes. I’m sorry.
36

INT. BEDROOM. EVENING

36

The door bursts open and Eilis comes rushing in, clutching
her letters. She sits down on the bed, and tears the first
one open. As soon as she starts reading she begins to weep
uncontrollably. We hear ROSE’s voice.
ROSE (V.O)
The big news here is that since you
left, Mummy has stopped shopping at
Nettles Kelly’s.
36A

INT. OFFICE. DAY.

Rose is at her desk, writing to Eilis.
ROSE (V.O.)
As you know, her bread wasn’t
always fresh, and she overcharged
for everything. And she’s awful.
36B

INT. BEDROOM. EVENING.

Rose’s voice fades out. Eilis’s crying reaches a new level she has to stop reading because she can no longer see. The
banal domestic details of her old life intensify her
homesickness to an agonising pitch.

The girls are eating their breakfast and ignoring Eilis, who
is still reading and re-reading her letters. She’s not
crying, but she’s pale and unhappy-looking.
MARY (V.O.)
I haven’t told her to her face.
There’s no need. She knows that she
overcharges and her bread’s not
fresh.
38

INT. DINER. DAY

38

Eilis at what is obviously her usual position in the diner.
Her sandwich and glass of milk are untouched in front of her.
She’s reading the letters again.
ROSE (V.O.)
We talk about you every evening, of
course. We want to know everything.
I’m sure you’re busy, but even if
your letters were two hundred
pages, they wouldn’t be long enough
for your mother. Take care of
yourself. Love.
39

INT. BARTOCCI’S. DAY

39

Eilis at her counter. Her customary look of timidity has been
replaced by something altogether more despairing, and as she
serves a customer, she is quite clearly struggling for
composure. Miss Fortini watches from a distance. The customer
takes her purchase and leaves. Miss Fortini walks up to her.
MISS FORTINI
Is it your time of the month?
Eilis shakes her head.
MISS FORTINI (CONT’D)
So what is it?
Eilis cannot stops the tears. She shakes her head again.
MISS FORTINI (CONT’D)
You cannot carry on like this. You
must either cheer up, or pretend to
cheer up. Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.

INT. STAFF ROOM. DAY

40

Eilis sitting on her own in the large, shabby staff room,
full of overflowing ashtrays and coffee-cups with lipstick
rings on them. She’s still holding her glass of water.
Dorothy, her colleague, comes in.
DOROTHY
I forgot something.
She rummages, in a desultory fashion, through a pile of
newspapers and magazines on a table.
DOROTHY (CONT’D)
I heard you pulled a stunt. Nice
work if you can get it, sitting on
a chair in the staff room sipping a
glass of water.
The door opens, and Miss Fortini comes into the room with
FATHER FLOOD. Father Flood is bearded, pleasant-looking,
clearly trustworthy. He smiles warmly at Eilis.
FATHER FLOOD
I’m so sorry, Eilis. This is all my
fault.
Eilis looks at him, surprised. Father Flood is about to
continue, but he looks at Dorothy first.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
Would you give us a moment? Thank
you.
Dorothy leaves, throwing Eilis a look. Miss Fortini notes it.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
I’d been led to believe that you
didn’t need looking after. Franco
Bartocci said you were doing great
here. Ma Kehoe said you were the
nicest lodger she’d ever had...
Eilis smiles.
What?
Ma Kehoe!

FATHER FLOOD

Miss Fortini, observing the slight uplift in Eilis’s mood,
slips out of the room.

Eilis nods vehemently.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
But at the same time, you know you
can’t, because there’s nothing
there. It would be the end of you.
She says nothing.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
I have enrolled you in a night
class. For book-keeping. Brooklyn
College, the best there is. It
will be three nights a week, but
you’ll get a good qualification at
the end of it. And I’ve paid your
tuition for the first semester.
Eilis looks at him wonderingly.
Why?

EILIS

Father Flood smiles.
FATHER FLOOD
“Why?” Not, “Thank you”?
Eilis looks stricken.
EILIS
I’m sorry. Thank you. But...Why?
Father Flood thinks for a moment.
FATHER FLOOD
I was amazed that someone as
clever as you couldn’t find proper
work. I have been here too long: I
forget what it’s like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me
about you, I said that the Church
would try to help. Anyway, we need
Irish girls in Brooklyn.
EILIS
I wish I could stop feeling that I
want to be an Irish girl in
Ireland.

Eilis thinks about this, and nods decisively.

INT. BROOKLYN COLLEGE. NIGHT

41

Eilis listening to a lecture in her night class. She’s
absorbed, anxious, furiously taking notes. She is the only
woman in the class; the men are all either Jewish or Italian.
The lecturer, MR ROSENBLUM, is in his forties, bespectacled,
and wearing a skull-cap. He’s animated by his subject, but
it’s clear that most of the class are despairingly perplexed.
MR ROSENBLUM
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co
is one of the most important
corporate cases decided in the
Supreme Court in the last twenty
years. This was the case
responsible for the Deep Rock
doctrine, so it’s maybe the biggest
milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration
proceedings alone...
He stops, looks at his students, to emphasise the point he is
making.
MR ROSENBLUM (CONT’D)
.. literally thousands of investors
may be affected by its application.
We see a close-up of Eilis’s pad: she’s underlining the words
‘literally thousands’.
42

INT. BROOKLYN COLLEGE - CORRIDOR. NIGHT

42

Eilis is sitting outside the lecture room on a wooden bench,
while the other students stretch their limbs and yawn. She’s
eating a sandwich. A young Jewish man is sitting a few feet
away from her, doing the same thing. He looks at her.
YOUNG MAN
Did you understand any of that? I
mean, a single word?
Eilis, eating, shakes her head, covers her mouth with her
hands, laughs.

the last remaining crust into her mouth.

INT. DINING ROOM, MRS. KEHOE’S HOUSE. EVENING

Dinner time, all the girls and their landlady, the usual
formation. Miss McAdam, the battle-axe from Belfast, is
holding forth.
MISS MCADAM
One of the things that ruins
Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
MRS KEHOE
So that’s one cheese sandwich for
Miss McAdam, and extra turkey for
everyone else.
The girls snigger; Diana brays.
MRS KEHOE (CONT’D)
Ladies, please. Eilis, Father Flood
told me about your Christmas plans.
DIANA
Oh, you’re not serving lunch to the
old fellas who’ve got nowhere to
go, are you? He asks us every year,
and we always say no.
SHEILA
You’re a saint, Eilis. They smell
awful.
PATTY
Sheila knows how they smell because
that’s where she goes husbandhunting.
Diana brays again.

Silence falls around the table. The other girls look at
Eilis, some pityingly, some clearly irritated.

It’s a bright, cold Christmas morning. Mrs Kehoe and Eilis
are on their way to Father Flood’s lunch. They’re both
carrying big bags of potatoes.
MRS KEHOE
I know how you’re feeling, Eilis.
The first Christmas away is hard
for all my girls, but there’s
nothing I can do. All I can say is
that the next one won’t be as bad.
Eilis cannot afford to think that far ahead, and in any case
there is little consolation in Mrs Kehoe’s words.
EILIS
(quiet)
No. I suppose not.
45

INT. PARISH HALL. DAY

45

The hall is old, and shabby, but it has been decorated with
paper streamers, and it looks cheery and welcoming. There are
several long trestle tables, each the length of the hall.
Eilis and many other women, including Mrs Kehoe, all wearing
paper hats, are laying the tables. Father Flood looks on
anxiously.
FATHER FLOOD
I think we will have to open the
doors, ready or not. Maureen?
A woman standing near the large double doors unbolts them and
opens them. Immediately, old, shabby, tubercular men start to
pour through the door in an apparently never-ending stream.
It is a haunting, moving sight: the lost, the lonely and the
defeated. Eilis forgets herself and stares at them.
EILIS
(to Father Flood)
How many are we expecting?
FATHER FLOOD
There were two hundred last year.
There may be more this.

Eilis and Father Flood watch as the men are chivvied along to
one of the long trestle tables. Almost immediately they are
served with soup and stout.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
All Irish. And all Irish men, more
or less. The occasional couple,
when the woman is too old to cook.
EILIS
Why don’t they go home?
FATHER FLOOD
If there’s nothing at home for a
young clever girl such as yourself,
there’s nothing at home for men
like these. Some of them have been
here nearly fifty years and have
lost touch with everyone. These are
the men who built the tunnels and
the bridges and the highways. God
alone knows what they live on now.
Eilis becomes fixated by one particular man. He is wearing an
old brown coat and a scarf, and his cap almost obscures his
face. She looks as though she’s seen a ghost. She puts her
hand to her mouth in shock.
FATHER FLOOD (CONT’D)
Don’t tell me you know someone
here.
Eilis can’t speak for a moment.
My da.

EILIS

FATHER FLOOD
I was told that your father had
passed away.
Eilis recovers herself.
EILIS
Yes. He did. Four years ago. I’m
sorry.
FATHER FLOOD
I understand. Christmas lunch in
the Parish Hall... It’s like seeing
faces in the fire. It’s happened to
me. I have seen men from my
childhood who must have been dead
thirty years or more. Which one?
Eilis points at the man in the brown coat.

FATHER FLOOD
No. But I know him. You’ll see why
later.
Later. The room is filled with smoke and conversation and
laughter. The tables are being cleared away, and bottles in
brown carrier bags are being passed around. In a corner of
the room, two men are playing fiddles and another a small
accordion. Father Flood pulls out a chair, stands on it and
clears his throat. Slowly, the room falls silent.
FATHER FLOOD
I don’t want to interrupt the
proceedings, but I’m sure you’d
like to show your appreciation to
all the ladies here for their hard
day’s work.
Father Flood leads the applause. Some of the men are
applauding in Eilis’s direction - she’s the youngest helper
in the room - and she blushes, smiles, looks down at her
feet.
FATHER FLOOD
And by way of a thank you
present... As many of you know,
there’s a great singer in the room
today, and perhaps he can be
persuaded to entertain us all.
Frankie?
The man in the brown coat gets to his feet and starts to sing
in Irish. The musicians in the corner join in, tentatively at
first, but then with confidence and sympathy. He sings the
slow, mournful ballad beautifully, and the smoke and squalor
of the room, the poverty of the diners, become beautiful too.
The haunting music carries on over the following montage:

The room is large, and surprisingly well-furnished: old rugs,
heavy, comfortable-looking furniture, dark pictures in gold

corner of the room, and a roaring fire in the hearth. Eilis
takes it all in while Mrs Kehoe pours her a glass of sherry.

She has the best room in the house.
The basement. It’s the biggest and
the warmest and the quietest and
the best-appointed, and it has its
own entrance.
Eilis doesn’t say anything, but she knows what’s coming.
MRS KEHOE
I can only let a certain kind of
girl stay there, do you see?
Eilis nods, while suppressing a smile. Mrs Kehoe notices her
amusement.
MRS KEHOE
Oh, and I’m not talking about
looks, here. (Beat) Although I will
admit that God gave Miss McAdam an
advantage, when I had to think
about who I could trust to live
down there. You’re a pretty girl,
Eilis, but you’re sensible. So.
You’re having the room and that’s
that. If you’re working tomorrow,
you can pack tonight, and I’ll have
your things moved in the morning.
EILIS
Will the other girls not mind?
MRS KEHOE
(with satisfaction)
Oh, I expect so. What don’t they

INT. DINING ROOM, MRS. KEHOE’S HOUSE. EVENING

There has been a significant change at the dinner table:
DOLORES, an Irish country girl - red hair, freckles, slow on
the uptake - has replaced Miss McAdam. There is an atmosphere
around the table that is new - the teasing and occasional
outbreaks of bitchiness have been replaced by a sullen and
resentful silence. It becomes clear that the ill-will is
directed at the newcomer.
Mrs Kehoe attempts to change the atmosphere.
MRS KEHOE
Girls, you’ll take Dolores to the
dance with you on Saturday night,
won’t you?
DOLORES
(delighted)
There’s a dance?
MRS KEHOE
Down at the parish hall. Father
Flood doesn’t think there’s enough
for you girls to do at the
weekends.
DIANA
Oh, there’s plenty for us to do. He
just doesn’t want us doing it.
Laughter around the table.
MRS KEHOE
There’ll be no alcohol, but you can
have fun without it.
DIANA
(with obvious insincerity)
Oh, Patty and I aren’t going this
week. We’re... going to see a movie
instead.
Eilis watches the dynamic carefully. She doesn’t want to get
involved.

a movie just as well.

SHEILA
Yes, it’s surprising, isn’t it?
You’d think it would be the other
way around.
Patty sniggers. Diana gives one of her awful laughs. The
dynamic of the group has clearly changed, with the advent of
Dolores: the relationship between Patty/Diana and Sheila is
less adversarial.
PATTY
Of course, you’d be welcome to join
us, Dolores. So long as you don’t
mind being a gooseberry.
MRS KEHOE
Ah, so you both miraculously found
boyfriends over the last couple of
days, did you? Well, I hope you
have more luck with these than you
did with the last few.
Sheila cannot resist a smile of satisfaction.
MRS KEHOE
Will you be going, Eilis?
EILIS
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
MRS KEHOE
Well, you can look after Dolores,
then.
Of course.

EILIS

INT. BEDROOM, MRS KEHOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT

53

Eilis is writing a letter in her new bedroom. It is so much
bigger and nicer than her previous room - it has a fire, a
rocking chair, rugs on the floor, and a desk, at which she is
sitting. She has photographs of Rose and her mother up on the
mantelpiece. Suddenly there is a knock on the door. Eilis
walks over and opens it - Patty and Diana are standing there.
DIANA
(whispering)
We need to talk to you.

EILIS
What is it now?
She pointedly doesn’t ask them in.
PATTY
It’s that Dolores. She’s a
scrubber.
Diana starts to laugh, and Patty claps a hand over her mouth.
PATTY
It’s true. She cleans houses. We
can’t have her at the table with
us. We’re shopgirls and
stenographers, not scrubbers.
EILIS
I’m trying to study.
She begins to close the door in their faces.
DIANA
A scrubber, from Cavan, living
under...
Eilis closes the door.
DIANA (O.S.)
...our roof?
54

EXT. PARISH HALL. NIGHT

54

Dolores and Eilis are queueing to get into the dance. We’ve
seen this before, back in Ireland, with Eilis and Nancy. But
Dolores is no Nancy. She has made a huge and grotesquely
misplaced effort for the dance. She’s wearing a cheap leather
jacket, a frilly white blouse and white skirt, black
stockings and garish bright red lipstick. Eilis’s discomfort
is acute.
And the surroundings are different, too. A group of African
American men are sitting on steps nearby, playing a game with
dice; two men wearing yarmulkes walk through the queue.
55

INT. PARISH HALL. NIGHT

Inside, however, Ireland has been successfully recreated:
there’s the non-alcoholic bar, the nearly empty dance-floor,
the Irish musicians. Eilis is sitting next to Dolores on a
wooden bench, watching the dancing. Eilis looks bored and
unhappy.

DOLORES
God, there’s nobody here. How are
we supposed to get a fella if
there’s nobody here?
EILIS
I expect most people will come
after nine.
DOLORES
People? Or fellas?
EILIS
Some of the people will be fellas.
DOLORES
I’d love to meet a fella.
Eilis closes her eyes despairingly.
DOLORES
Have you had an American fella? Are
they different?
Eilis ignores her.
DOLORES
(twittering, in a rush)
My aunt went with an American fella
once, in London, after the war. She
said he was different. I’ve always
wondered what she meant. I wish
she’d told me.
EILIS
(dry)
I don’t suppose it was anything
terribly complicated.
Eilis shuffles down the bench a little way. Suddenly the
doors burst open and a group of people come in - mostly young
women, but a couple of young men, too. Patty and Diana,
dressed up to the nines, are among them. Immediately the
atmosphere in the hall changes. More people start to dance,
there’s more laughter and enjoyment.
DOLORES
They came! The liars!
Eilis ignores her again. Dolores shuffles up to her on the
bench.

DOLORES
Did you see? What a pair of
bitches. That’s what the old woman
called them. She said they were all
bitches, apart from you.
Eilis has had enough. She has had enough of Dolores; she has
had enough of being the kind of person who will look after
Dolores. She hesitates for a moment, then stands up and goes
to talk to Patty and Diana.
PATTY
(recognising the symbolism
of the moment, and
amused)
Well, hello.
EILIS
Hello. It’s good to see you.
PATTY
I can see why. I don’t know what
you looked like, sitting there, but
you sure didn’t look like you were
having a good time.
Patty appraises her.
PATTY
Come with me.

INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

We see the reflection of the girls in the mirror as Patty
fiddles with Eilis’s hair.
I know.

PATTY

She rummages around in her handbag and pulls out a couple of
hair-grips. She uses them to put Eilis’s hair up for her.
PATTY
There. That’s better. Now you don’t
look like you’ve just come in from
milking the cows.
EILIS
Is that what I looked like?
PATTY
Just a bit. Nice clean cows. Let’s
go.

INT. PARISH HALL. NIGHT

57

Eilis is standing with Patty and a group of her friends,
including a young man with heavily oiled hair who is teaching
Eilis the steps to the dance that is currently happening on
the dance floor. She is slightly distracted by a young man
staring at her and smiling, a little distance away. This is
TONY - dark, attractive, white teeth, muscular. She ignores
him and carries on with her lesson. When she looks back, he’s
still staring, still smiling.
YOUNG MAN WITH OILY HAIR
(shouting over the music)
Maybe we could have a dance later?
I’m sorry?

EILIS

YOUNG MAN WITH OILY HAIR
A dance? Later?
Oh. Sure.

EILIS

He smiles and leads Patty onto the dance-floor, flirtatiously
enough to suggest that it was Patty he was interested in all
the time. The moment he’s gone, Tony makes a move.
TONY
Are you here with that guy? The one
who was teaching you to dance?
Unlike just about every other man at the dance, Tony is
American.
No.

EILIS

TONY
So would you dance with me?
EILIS
I’m not sure he taught me anything.
TONY
Doesn’t matter. The secret is to
look as though you know what you’re
doing.
EILIS
Ah. I wish someone had told me that
years ago.
He leads her into the middle of the other dancing couples,
and they start trying to pick up the steps. It is apparent
that Tony can dance, but he doesn’t want to show Eilis up, so
he assumes her levels of incompetence and uncertainty.

Later. Tony and Eilis are dancing cheek-to-cheek - not
smooching, but clearly relaxed in each other’s company. Over
Tony’s shoulder, Eilis catches Patty’s eye. Patty makes a soso face. Eilis ignores her.
TONY
Where do you live?
Eilis pauses, and then decides it’s OK to tell him.
EILIS
Clinton Street.
TONY
Yeah? That’s on my way home. Can I
walk you?
EILIS
I’m going to say yes, then I’m
going to tell you why.
He laughs.
TONY
So I don’t get the wrong idea?
Eilis pauses again. It wouldn’t be the wrong idea. It just
wouldn’t be the only idea.
EILIS
I suppose so. Is there a girl in a
leather jacket sitting on her own
on the bench over there?
Tony moves so that he can look discreetly. The camera picks
out Dolores, sitting on her own, picking at her fingernails.
TONY
(incredulously)
You don’t know her?
EILIS
I do. She lives in my boarding
house, and she’s awful. If I leave
with you, I’m sure she’d
understand. You’d be rescuing me.
I get it.

TONY

Tony smiles a lot, winningly and unaffectedly.
EILIS
She’ll be OK, won’t she?
TONY
Sure she will.

Eilis and Tony walking through the dark streets of Brooklyn,
huddled against each other for warmth. They walk in silence,
and then Tony blurts out
TONY
I’m not Irish.
EILIS
You don’t sound Irish.
TONY
I need to make this clear: no part
of me is Irish. I don’t have Irish
parents or grandparents or
anything. I’m Italian. My parents
are, anyway.
EILIS
So what were you doing at an Irish
dance? Don’t the Italians have
dances?
TONY
Yeah. And I wouldn’t want to take
you to one. They behave like
Italians all night.
EILIS
And what does that mean?
TONY
Oh, you know.
No.

EILIS

TONY
(mumbly)
Hands.
EILIS
Too many of them?
TONY
I think it could seem that way, if
you were a girl. Listen, I want
everything to be out in the open. I
came to the Irish dance because I
really like Irish girls.
EILIS
And I was the only one that would
dance with you?

Eilis is teasing him, and Tony knows it, but he’s not as
quick as she is. He tries to formulate a response, gives up,
grins again.
They arrive at Mrs Kehoe’s house.
EILIS
This is me.
TONY
Can I take you next week? Maybe get
something to eat first?
EILIS
I’d like that. Good night.
She smiles warmly at him, and goes into the house without
kissing him.
59

INT. DINER. NIGHT

59

Eilis and Tony getting something to eat first, before the
dance. They are eating in a cheap diner, with formica-topped
tables. They’re waiting for their food.
TONY (O.S.)
So...What do you do when you’re not
working?
She thinks.
EILIS
Well. There’s school. Just, you
know..Brooklyn College. I’m
studying book-keeping.
TONY (O.S.)
You want to be a book-keeper?
EILIS
I want to be an accountant one day.
But, yes, book-keeping first.
TONY (O.S.)
Wow. Is it difficult?
EILIS
I’m talking too much. Tell me about
plumbing.

EILIS
I don’t know anything.
TONY
You know that taps drip and toilets
get blocked and that’s all you need
to know. I don’t know anything
about book-keeping.
Suddenly it is as if Eilis has been switched on, and the
following comes out in an unstoppable, unbroken stream.
EILIS
There’s a lot to it. There’s all
the maths, of course, but that’s
not so complicated. The doubleentry system, that takes a while to
get used to. And we study company
law, too, and that terrifies
me.(Fades) So we had to read about
an insurance company that went
bankrupt in the 1930s, and all the,
the legal issues that...
Later. Tony is finishing off his food and listening. Eilis’s
food goes untouched, although several times her loaded fork
almost makes it to her mouth.
EILIS
(her voice fading in)
...she plays golf, and she’s really
good at it. And if she’d been at
the dance last Saturday, then I
don’t think you’d have looked at me
twice, because Rose is beautiful.
Tony has finished - his plate is clean.
TONY (O.S.)
I’m worried you haven’t eaten
anything.
EILIS

Too busy talking.

She looks steadily at Eilis.
MRS KEHOE
Is this all because Eilis has found
herself a young man?
DIANA
(mock-surprised)
Eilis’s got herself a young man? We
didn’t know. She won’t say anything
about him.
MRS KEHOE
And why should she, to you awful
gossip-mongers? Anyway, I met him
on Saturday night when he called
for Eilis, and he’s a gentleman.
PATTY
Well, will you tell us what you
know about him, Mrs Kehoe? We’re
starving here. We know that he’s
quite nice-looking.
SHEILA
I didn’t like his shoes much.
EILIS
What on earth is wrong with his
shoes?
SHEILA
They were a funny colour.
MRS KEHOE
I’ll tell you this much: I am going
to ask Father Flood to preach a
sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I now see that giddiness is the
eighth deadly sin. A giddy girl is
every bit as evil as a slothful
man, and the noise she makes is a
lot worse. Now, enough.

spend hours and hours talking about
one stupid item of clothing with a
woman who’s so afraid of what she
looks like. But in the winter
she’ll splash thirty-five dollars
on a coat in the blink...
Dorothy is staring into a box she has just opened.
DOROTHY
I don’t believe it.
Eilis looks at her quizzically.
DOROTHY
I’m gonna talk to Miss Fortini
about this.
She marches off. Eilis peers into the box. It contains Red
Fox stockings. She takes a packet out and examines it.
Later. Miss Fortini comes over to speak to Eilis. She’s
angry.
MISS FORTINI
Eilis, I want you to know that
Dorothy has left our employment.
Eilis looks at her wonderingly.
MISS FORTINI
As of today. She’s clearing her
locker. (Beat) Listen. Brooklyn is
changing, and we have to change
with it.
Eilis nods, even though she is mystified by the series of
apparent non-sequiturs - the stockings, Dorothy, the speech.
MISS FORTINI
Our old customers are moving out to
Long Island and we can’t follow
them, so we need new customers
every week. Which means we welcome
every single person who comes into
this store. They all have money to
spend. Remember that.
I will.

Red Fox stockings are specially

Dorothy was unhappy about us
selling them. I asked her to leave.
Are you unhappy?

Miss Fortini walks off. Eilis immediately turns her attention

Eilis comes out of her classroom with a couple of other
students, books under her arm, and begins to walk down the
stairs. In the entrance hall she can see Tony, looking around
anxiously, clearly worried about missing her. She stops - she
clearly isn’t expecting to see him. She watches him for a
moment - he doesn’t see her - and she takes in his open face,
his vulnerability... He sees her and his face breaks out into
a radiant and relieved smile. She smiles back, and walks down
the remaining steps towards him.
TONY
All I want to do is travel home
with you. No drink, no food, no
nothing. I know you have to study,
and get some sleep. I’ll take you
to your house and then say
goodnight. Otherwise it’s too long
to wait.
He says this with such unaffected simplicity that it’s
impossible not to love him. Eilis smiles her assent.

woman in her thirties.

Yeah. He’s eight going on eighteen.
He’s nice and he’s smart, but he’s
been talking and talking about all
the things he’s going to say to
you.
EILIS
What sort of things?
TONY
We don’t know. Could be anything.
I tried to pay him money to go out

Tony’s apartment is tiny, and Eilis appears somewhat wedged
in around the dinner table. Tony has two older brothers,
Laurenzio and Maurizio, as well as kid brother Frankie. His
mother and father are young - much younger than Eilis’s
mother.
The atmosphere around the table is polite and warm. It’s not
a question of Eilis having to impress the Fiorello family they want to impress her, too, or at least the adults do.
They understand that she is important to Tony, and Tony is
important to them.
Eilis is doing her best with her spaghetti, which is covered

No, no. Diana, who lives in the

cooked me some spaghetti and made
me try and eat it without making a
mess.
MR FIORELLO
What do you eat in Ireland? Just
Irish stew?
EILIS
Not just. We...
FRANKIE
So first of all I should say that
we don’t like Irish people.
There are general cries of outrage around the table.
Maurizio, who is sitting next to him, cuffs him on the top of
his head.
FRANKIE
(outraged)
We don’t! That is a well known
fact! A big gang of Irish beat
Maurizio up and he had to have
stitches. And because all the cops
round here are Irish, nobody did
anything about it.
Eilis looks at Maurizio for confirmation. He looks
embarrassed.
MAURIZIO
There are probably two sides to it.

His brothers applaud and laugh. Frankie makes a face at them
and sits down at the table.
Later. They are eating scallopini, on their own, with no
vegetables, Italian-style.
MAURIZIO
So has Tony offered to take you to
Ebbett’s Field when the season
starts?
EILIS
(to Tony)
You like baseball?
More laughter around the table.
MAURIZIO
(incredulous)
He never mentioned the Dodgers? Not
even once?

FRANKIE
You know why? Too much of this.
He makes a lewd kissing noise. Tony rolls his eyes. Eilis has
the good grace to laugh.
LAURENZIO
Anyway, you’ll have to go to
Ebbett’s Field if you want to see
him in the summer.
EILIS
They’re that important to you?
TONY
Put it this way. If our kids end up
supporting the Yankees or the
Giants, it would break my heart.
The family laughs, but Eilis can only manage a small smile.
“Our kids”? Suddenly Eilis sees that their future is all
mapped out, as far as Tony and his family are concerned.
Frankie is watching her complicated reaction.
FRANKIE
She’s not laughing, Tony. I think
it’s too late. She’s a Yanks fan.
More laughter. But Tony is watching her carefully.
73

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

73

Tony and Eilis outside Mrs Kehoe’s. Tony comes in close to
Eilis, holds her, kisses her cheek. Eilis is stiff, a little
afraid.
TONY
(softly)
I love you.
Eilis stays in the embrace a moment longer, then pulls away.
EILIS
I..Thank you for the evening. It
was lovely.
She walks down the path towards her house, leaving Tony
staring wistfully after her.

INT. BATHROOM, MRS. KEHOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT

Eilis in the bathroom in her dressing gown, cleaning her
teeth. She stops, and looks at herself in the mirror - maybe
trying to imagine herself older, married, a mother, an
American. The bathroom door rattles.

SHEILA (O.S.)

Eilis is pulled out of the reverie and opens the door.
EILIS
I’d finished. (Beat, and then,
tentatively) Sheila... Can I ask
you something? Why aren’t you
married?
SHEILA
Because my husband met somebody
else and left me.
EILIS
Oh. I’m sorry.
Sheila shrugs.
EILIS
And...Well, would you get married
again?
SHEILA
Has someone asked you?
EILIS
No. Not really.
SHEILA
I won’t ask what that means. Would
I get married again? No. I want to
be waiting outside the bathroom of
my boarding-house forever.
Eilis doesn’t know how to take this.
SHEILA
Of course I do. That’s why I go to
that wretched dance every week. I
want to be waiting outside my own
bathroom. (Beat) While some badtempered fella with hair growing
out of his ears reads the newspaper
on the toilet. And then I’ll wish I
was back here, talking to you.
She laughs despairingly, and shrugs.
75

EXT. BROOKLYN COLLEGE. NIGHT

Eilis emerges from her class, starts to walk down the stairs
and stops, scanning the entrance hall. Tony isn’t there. She
walks down the stairs slowly, still looking around. She stops
in the entrance hall and waits for a moment.

Eilis stands waiting outside, looking up and down the street

street.
Eilis!

TONY (O.S.)

She looks around. Tony is on the other side of the street,
breathless and smiling. Eilis smiles broadly back, with
visible relief.
I’m sorry.

TONY

EILIS
I thought you weren’t coming.
TONY
Yeah. I thought you’d think that.
That’s why I wanted to be here no
matter what.
EILIS
I need to say something to you.
Tony’s face falls. He thinks he knows what’s coming.
TONY
Can you... Can we talk about
something else until we get to Mrs
Kehoe’s?
EILIS
It’s not...
Please?

TONY

They start to walk along the street together.
TONY
So. Ten minutes before I’m supposed
to meet you and I’m standing ankledeep in sewage that’s pouring
through this old lady’s ceiling.
Eilis looks at his shoes, reflexively.
TONY
Yeah. Even if you were thinking of
inviting me in for a coffee, I’d
have to say no, for your sake.

EILIS
So how did you fix it in ten
minutes?
TONY
I didn’t. I spent the whole ten
minutes explaining to the old lady
that I had to be somewhere and I’d
be back. She didn’t want to let me
go.
EILIS
So the sewage is still pouring
through the ceiling?
Tony shrugs.
TONY
Oh, what’s the difference between
six inches of sewage and a foot?
Eilis laughs. Tony looks at her anxiously - is she really
going to break off their relationship? Eilis stops.
EILIS
Let me say what I want to say. I
think... I think you’ll... I don’t
think you’ll mind.
Tony takes a deep breath.
Okay.

TONY

EILIS
You remember that after I had
dinner at your house, you told me
that you loved me.
Tony nods, sombre and nervous.
EILIS
Well, I didn’t really know what to
say. But I know what to say now. I
have thought about you and I like
you, and I like seeing you, and
maybe I feel the same way. So the
next time you tell me you love me,
if there is a next time, I’ll..I’ll
say I love you too.
TONY

Are you serious?
Yes.

I mean it.

EILIS

So why aren’t you smiling?
She flashes him a quick, forced smile.
EILIS
Can I go home now?
TONY
You love me?
EILIS
Yes. But don’t ask me anything
else, and don’t talk about our kids
being Dodgers fans.
TONY
(laughing)
You want kids who like the Yankees?
EILIS
Tony, please don’t push me.
TONY
(suddenly sober)
All right. I’m sorry.
They walk on.

EXT. STREET. EVENING

77

Eilis is walking down a Brooklyn street on an early summer
evening, holding an envelope. The trees are green, children
are playing in the street, the last of the daylight is
glinting off the roofs. Eilis takes it all in; she’s happy.
She reaches Father Flood’s parish house and knocks on the
door.

FATHER FLOOD
Well. You’re marvellous. That’s all
I have to say. And it looks to me
as though you didn’t just pass
those exams. You, you flew through
them.
Eilis smiles shyly.
FATHER FLOOD
Most people who come and visit me
without notice are in trouble, of
some kind or another. I can’t
remember the last time anyone came
here with good news.
EILIS
I have saved some money. I’ll be
able to pay next year’s tuition and
pay you back for last year.
FATHER FLOOD
One of my parishioners paid. He
needed to do something for mankind,
and I won’t tell you why. He’s not
out of the woods yet, either, so he
can cough up for next year, too.
EILIS
I’d love to know what sort of woods
he’s in.
FATHER FLOOD
Yes, well you won’t hear it from
me. How’s Tony?
Eilis looks at him, surprised to be asked.
EILIS
He’s well. Thank you for asking.
FATHER FLOOD
He’s a solid man. Qualifications
and a boyfriend, Eilis. You’re not
the miserable young girl who wanted
to go home last winter.
EILIS
That seems like years ago.

Kehoe comes to the table with a large pie on a plate.
MRS KEHOE
I think this is the first time that
any girl of mine has passed an exam
while living here, so I bought us a
treat.
There are murmurs of appreciation. Mrs Kehoe sits down at the
table and starts cutting the pie into slices and putting the
slices into bowls.
PATTY
Have you told Tony, Eilis?
Of course.

EILIS

SHEILA
And is he taking you out to
celebrate?
EILIS
We’re going to Coney Island at the
weekend.
DIANA
(drily)
Oh, boy.
EILIS
What does that mean?
DIANA
You have a bathing costume?
EILIS
No. I was going to get one at...
PATTY
Do you have sunglasses?

No.

EILIS
(increasingly alarmed)

SHEILA
You need sunglasses. I read that if
you don’t have them on the beach
this year people will talk about
you.
MRS KEHOE

Mrs Kehoe rolls her eyes.
MRS KEHOE
Diana’s right, though, Eilis. You

costume. It’s the most Tony will
ever have seen of you. You don’t
want to put him off.

INT. BARTOCCI’S. DAY

Eilis in her lunch hour, choosing a one-piece bathing suit
from the racks in front of her. She picks out a black one and
a pink one, and goes off towards the dressing-rooms. As if
from nowhere, Miss Fortini appears.
MISS FORTINI
Are you going to the beach?
EILIS
Yes, Miss Fortini. To Coney Island.
With Tony.
MISS FORTINI
Well, I know he’s a saint, this
Tony, but every Italian man cares
about how his girlfriend looks in
her bathing suit. I’d better help
you.
Thank you.

EILIS

INT. CHANGING ROOM. DAY

81

Eilis walks into one of the cubicles, but before she can pull
the curtain across, Miss Fortini is in the cubicle with her.
There’s hardly room for the two of them. Eilis starts to get
undressed, as modestly as she can in the peculiar
circumstances. Miss Fortini watches her, matter-of-factly.
Later. Eilis is wearing the black suit. Miss Fortini looks at
her thoughtfully, and then reaches forward to pull down the
fabric at the top of Eilis’s thigh.

She then reaches round to cup Eilis’s bottom. Eilis is too
shocked to say anything.
MISS FORTINI
You’re all right there for the
moment. And most Italian men
appreciate the fuller figure. But
watch yourself, over the summer.
She steps back as far as she can and looks at her.
MISS FORTINI
The black’s too dark, for your pale
skin. Let’s see you in the green.
Eilis hesitates.

Tony and Eilis on the boardwalk at Coney Island. It’s a
bright, beautiful day; Eilis is, after all, wearing
fashionable sunglasses and a headscarf. They’re both eating
cotton candy. They stop and look for a space on the packed
beach.
TONY
I can see a spot down there that’s
probably big enough for one. If we
can wedge ourselves in, maybe we
can eventually create enough space
for two.

Tony is holding a towel round Eilis as she struggles in to
her bathing costume. He’s looking away, presumably at her
request.
EILIS
Why didn’t you tell me to put my
costume on underneath my clothes?
TONY
I thought you’d know.
She’s finished struggling.
I’m ready.

EILIS

He drops the towel. Eilis stands there in her costume, a
little embarrassed. Tony gives a loud and lascivious wolfwhistle. Eilis giggles with embarrassment and pleasure.
86

EXT. SEA. DAY

Eilis and Tony in the sea. Eilis swims away from Tony - she’s
a good swimmer - but he swims after her, catches her and
draws him to her. He picks her up as she tries to wriggle
away, laughing. He pulls her to him and kisses her. She
freezes a little and pushes him away.
TONY
(smiling)
I’m sorry. What’s a guy supposed to
do?
She looks at him, and then kisses him deeply.
FADE OUT.

INT. BARTOCCI’S. DAY

Eilis at her counter, serving a customer. Music, something
ominously melancholic that undercuts the banal pleasantries

tournament. You must have been
really pleased.

Mary enters the bedroom. Rose is sprawled half out of the
bed, her head nearly touching the floor; Mary rushes over to
her, touches her cheek, starts to weep.

But I think I can say that for the
first time since I’ve been in
America, I’m really happy.

At the weekend he took me to see
the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball
team he loves. They lost, so he was
annoyed.

I’ll soon be able to afford to...
Her voice trails off. We can’t hear what Father Flood is
saying to her, but she looks stricken. The music fades.

INT. STAFF ROOM. DAY

94

Father Flood and Eilis are sitting on two chairs in the
middle, knees almost touching. Eilis is staring at the floor,
in shock; Father Flood is watching her with enormous
tenderness and concern.
FATHER FLOOD
It was sudden. I think perhaps she
was ill, and she knew she was ill,
and she didn’t tell anybody.
EILIS
What will happen?
FATHER FLOOD
(softly)
What can happen?
EILIS
When will they bury her?
Tomorrow.

FATHER FLOOD

EILIS
Without me.
FATHER FLOOD
Without you. You’re too far away,
Eilis.
Eilis starts to cry, and becomes almost hysterical.
EILIS
Why did I ever come here? Why did I
ever come here?

Tony and Eilis are sitting in the diner that they use before
the Saturday night dances. They have coffee cups in front of
them, but they’re not drinking. Tony is quiet, grief-stricken
for a woman he’s never met.
TONY
I keep thinking about what it would
be like if one of my brothers died.
I’m sorry if that sounds selfish.
But it means I can feel what you’re
feeling.
EILIS
I think about it and think about
it, and then I forget about it for
a moment, and when I remember again
it’s as though I’ve just been told.
I can’t bear it, Tony.
TONY
I wish I could stay with you
tonight.
EILIS
But I’ll see you in the morning.
It’s very nice of your family, to
come to Mass with me.
TONY
They wouldn’t miss it for anything.
I don’t mean that like it sounds. I

Eilis blinks back more tears.
EILIS
And how would it be for you if I
did go home?
Tony shrugs, and then says, simply and sincerely
TONY
I’d be afraid, every single day.
EILIS
Afraid that I wouldn’t come back?
TONY
Yeah. Home is home.
EILIS
I’m not sure I have a home any
more.
Tony thinks.
TONY
You’re not going to work tomorrow,
are you?
No.

TONY
After the mass, can I take you
somewhere?

EXT. LONG ISLAND. DAY

Tony and Eilis are standing on a piece of utterly featureless
and undeveloped land. The wind is blowing, and we can hear
seagulls, although there is no view of the sea.

We’re going to build five houses
here, if we can. Mom and Dad will
have one, because Mom has always
wanted a house with a back yard.
And we’ll sell three. And the other
one...My brothers asked me if I
wanted it, and I said I did.
Tony studies her face intently.
TONY
So I guess what I’m saying is,
would you like to live here on Long
Island? I know it doesn’t look like
much right now, but all the land
around here has been sold, so we
wouldn’t be on our own. And there’d
be, there’d be telephone cables and
electricity and everything.
Eilis laughs.
EILIS
I would hope so.
TONY
We’re going to set up a company, a
building company, the three of us,
and I’m gonna do the plumbing, and
Laurence will do the carpentry,
and..
Eilis looks around her, trying to imagine the future that
Tony sees. It’s not so hard to do.
TONY
Don’t go quiet on me. At least tell
me you’ll think about it.
EILIS
I don’t need to think about it.
She holds out her hands, and Tony takes them, and she pulls
him towards her. The camera pulls back and back until we see
two tiny figures, on their own, standing in the middle of
their own future, of a part of America that doesn’t even
exist yet.

up.
EILIS
Part of me doesn’t even want to

FATHER FLOOD
It’s a difficult conversation to be
having, Eilis. You wouldn’t be
human if you were looking forward
to it.
The telephone rings. Both of them stare at it for a second,

Hello? Mummy?
She sounds noticeably more Irish throughout the conversation.
EILIS
I can’t really hear you.

Mary is in the same situation - in an unfamiliar
ecclesiastical office, with a priest watching her with
concern. Mary looks so much older than the last time we saw
her, and completely defeated. What comes out of her mouth
cannot reflect the depth of her pain.
MARY
Well, the rain held off, anyway.
Intercut phone conversation.
EILIS
That’s good.
MARY
And the whole of her golf club
came. Every single one of them. We

EILIS

MARY
Nobody knew what to say to me.
Finally, her words reflect how she is feeling.
MARY
When your daddy died, I said to
myself that I shouldn’t grieve too
much because I had you two. And
when you went to America, I told
myself the same thing because she
was here with me. But everyone’s

Eilis and Tony enter the basement room. Eilis takes off her
coat, and Tony stands there awkwardly.
TONY
So this is it? This is where you
live?
EILIS
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise
she’ll evict me.
Shyly, she walks towards him and kisses him gently. The kiss
becomes more passionate. Eilis pulls his shirt out from his
trousers and runs her hands up and down his back. They move
towards the single bed without speaking. Tony lifts Eilis’s
skirt and undoes his trousers and lies down on top of her.
All the time, there is a sense that Tony is taking his cue
from her, that he would stop the moment Eilis expressed any
doubt or fear. But she moves out from underneath him and
discreetly removes her panties. Tony pulls his trousers off
and takes off his boxer shorts.
They make love. Eilis tries hard not to panic at the feeling
of Tony inside her, but she’s clearly shocked by the
sensation; meanwhile Tony is much noisier than she would want
him to be, and that panics her further. Eventually he is
still, and he lies on top of her for a moment.
A floorboard creaks above their heads. Tony looks up, looks
at Eilis.
EILIS
Oh, there’s no point in worrying
now. Stay with me.
Tony gets off her, stands up, takes the rest of his clothes
off and gets into bed. Eilis hesitates, then starts to
unstrap her bra.

Mrs Kehoe is sitting at the kitchen table reading the
newspaper. There is a frosty silence. Patty comes in and
fills the kettle.
MRS KEHOE
Patty, I’ve put a lock on the
basement gate. Just for peace of
mind. You never know who might try
to get in there.
She folds the paper, stands up and leaves the room.
PATTY
As God is my witness, I heard
nothing last night. Nothing at all.
But it sounded lovely.
Eilis looks away, embarrassed.

Eilis and Tony walking in to City Hall, hand-in-hand. Both

107

INT. CITY HALL. DAY

107

Eilis and Tony are in the waiting room in City Hall; there
are a couple of other parties waiting to get married, but
they really are parties, with friends and parents and
siblings. The group sitting nearest to them contains an eight
or nine year-old boy, Frankie’s age, who is bored, and
getting into trouble with his parents. Tony leaves Eilis
sitting on a chair and starts fooling around with the boy:
they play bat and ball with a rolled-up newspaper and a light
plastic ball that the kid has been playing catch with. The
boy’s father comes over.
BOY’S FATHER
Is he annoying you? Because he was
annoying me.
The father is Irish.
TONY
No, no. I got a brother the exact
same age. Hey, are you Irish?
BOY’S FATHER
(grinning)
Is it so obvious?

TONY
I’m just about to marry an Irish
girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
BOY’S FATHER
Sometimes it seems as though there
can’t be anybody left at home.
Where’s your girl from?
TONY
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.
Have you heard of it?
Tony throws the kid a gentle pitch with the ball.
BOY’S FATHER
I think my wife has family there,
but she’s got family everywhere.
TONY
It’s the same thing with my family.
If you believe anything my dad
says, the Fiorellos own most of
Italy. I don’t understand why we
ever left.
The other man chuckles. Tony calls over to Eilis.
TONY
Hey, Eilis. Come here a second.
An official from County Hall emerges from an office and
addresses the waiting room.
OFFICIAL
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
TONY
Maybe another time.
Good luck.

BOY’S FATHER

Eilis takes his arm. Tony kisses her on her cheek and they
walk off to get married.

TONY
They’ll believe that we saw a movie
and ate hot dogs. They won’t
believe that on our wedding night I
dropped you off at Ma Kehoe’s and
went home.
Eilis smiles and kisses him again. The camera pans back to
show the married couple, kissing in the dark with nowhere to
go.
FADE TO BLACK
109

EXT. CHURCH IN IRELAND. DAY

109

A sunny Sunday morning. Eilis is emerging from Mass arm-inarm with Mary. Suddenly we see what we haven’t been able to
notice before: Eilis has come back from America a different
person. She’s older, and more sophisticated, her clothes are
better and brighter than those of anyone else from her town,
her hair-style classier, her skin a different colour. Mary,
meanwhile, has been aged very quickly by grief and
loneliness.
Eilis’s emergence into the Sunday morning light is
complicated. People are excited to see her, but at the same
time they know they have to be respectful of her recent loss.
Her friend NANCY - Eilis’s age, pretty, bubbly - is, however,
just overwhelmed with excitement, and pushes through the
emerging congregation to greet her. Eilis breaks into a broad
smile.
Nancy!

EILIS

In a modern age, or a less buttoned-up culture, they would
fall into each other’s arms and squeal. There is that level
of excitement, but they channel it through the clasping of
hands.
NANCY
You look so glamorous!
MARY
(sourly)
I told you so.
Eilis rolls her eyes at Nancy.

NANCY
It was a beautiful funeral, Mrs
Lacey.
EILIS
How are you?
Nancy wiggles her fingers, and Eilis sees the engagement ring
on her finger.

No!

EILIS
(excited)

MARY
I knew. But I wanted to let Nancy
tell you herself.
NANCY
I’m so glad you can come to the
wedding.
Can I?

EILIS

NANCY
Your mother accepted the invitation
on your behalf.
EILIS
When is it?
NANCY
The 27th of August.
Eilis’s smile freezes perceptibly.
NANCY
Will you come out with George and
me tomorrow night? Annette wants to
see you, too.
Eilis looks at Mary for permission.
MARY
Oh, I don’t mind. I’ll have to find
you a key. I don’t want you getting
me out of bed.

Nancy rejoins her parents, who are standing a little way
away, waiting for her.
EILIS
I’m booked to go back to New York
on the twenty-first.
MARY
(blithe)
Oh, you can wait an extra week to
see your best friend married.

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

110

Eilis walking down a path in her local church in Ireland.
She’s holding a wreath. Close on her hands - she takes her
wedding ring out of her pocket, slips it on.
She arrives at Rose’s grave. She kneels, places the wreath on
the grave, stands up. She’s sombre, near tears, but together.
EILIS
I’ve come home. Just for...
An elderly lady is coming down the path. Eilis stops, selfconscious, and waits until she’s walked past.
EILIS
Just for a month or so. I know
mother needed me home. There’s so
much to do. Mother wants me to go
through all your clothes, and take
what I want. I can’t bear to take
anything. (Beat) Rose, I got
married. I married Tony. Just
before I left. Nobody knows, not
even Mother. Only you, now. We were
married at City Hall, and when I go
back we’ll get married properly.
I’ll tell people then. I can’t
believe I’m married to someone you
will never know. But you’d like
him. I know you would. He’s sweet,
and funny, and he has these
wonderful eyes that..
She stops and sighs heavily.

Every time I hear even the

pray for you every day. I hope you
pray for us.
She closes her eyes, momentarily, and then walks away.

Eilis and Mary, sitting at the table in the front room,
plodding through the pile of letters that have to be written.
So now.

MARY

She picks up the next one in the pile.
MARY
Mrs O’Toole from Cush.
EILIS
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence
isn’t like getting a birthday
present, is it? What if Mrs O’Toole
from Cush writes back to thank you
for your thank you?
MARY
Then I’ll thank her.
EILIS
And you’d be happy to spend the
rest of your life like that?
MARY
It’s not as if I have anything else
to do. Nor anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs O’Toole
from Cush.
EILIS
(wearily)
What do you want me to say?
Just at that moment there is the sound of a car horn - two
beeps, a cheery greeting.
EILIS
That’ll be Nancy and George and
Annette.

Waiting outside in the gleaming four-door saloon car are
Nancy, GEORGE, her fiancee, and his friend JIM. Both men are
sporting the Rugby Club trademark blazers and Brylcreem.
There is no sign of Annette. The men are in the front seats it’s George’s car - and Nancy is in the back. Eilis pauses
momentarily when she sees Jim. She smiles thinly and gets in.
113

INT. GEORGE’S CAR. EVENING

113

Eilis settles herself in and George starts the car.
NANCY
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
(cool)
Hello.

EILIS

Jim turns around and shakes Eilis’s hand. He’s confident,
direct, sincere, manly. If he didn’t come with rugby-club
baggage, he might even be described as extremely attractive.
JIM
It’s a great pleasure to meet you.
Eilis nods. When Jim has turned around again, Eilis makes a
why-didn’t you-tell-me? face at Nancy.
JIM
(to George)
We could try the Connaught Hotel
bar. There may be a few of the
fellas from the rugby club there.
Eilis looks at Nancy, wanting her to say something; Nancy
doesn’t even know there’s something to say.
EILIS
(tartly)
Do you have to be with other fellas
from the rugby club all the time?
Jim turns around again. He’s amused.
JIM
No. But Nancy told us that we
wouldn’t be allowed to talk to you,
because you had too much to say to
each other. So we’re looking for
company.

Oh. Well.
She should probably apologise, but she doesn’t.
GEORGE
Do you not like the fellas from the
rugby club, Eilis?
He tries to catch Jim’s eye, but Jim doesn’t want to get
involved in this.
EILIS
I don’t, particularly, George.
Nancy nudges her and makes a pleading face. Eilis ignores
her.
EILIS
When I first went to America, I
missed every single thing about
Enniscorthy except one.
JIM
We’re not all the same.
EILIS
You all look the same. It’s the
blazer and the hair-oil.
Jim and George look at each other and laugh with recognition.
114

EXT. CONNAUGHT HOTEL DRIVEWAY. EVENING

114

They get out of the car. Jim and George walk ahead - Eilis
hangs back deliberately so that she can talk to Nancy.
EILIS
Why has he come? And where’s
Annette?
NANCY
He saw you at Mass on Sunday
morning, and he asked George if we
could arrange a drink, just the
four of us. And I knew you wouldn’t
come if I told you. He’s very nice,
so don’t be too hard on him.
EILIS
Is this the same Jim Farrell that
was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
What happened to her?

He broke it off. He didn’t think

very upset for a while, but he’s
over her now.
EILIS
Nancy, I’m..
She hesitates.
EILIS
I’m going back.
NANCY
He knows that. But you can have a
bit of fun while you’re here, can’t
you?
George and Jim wait for the girls to catch them up. George
and Nancy then walk ahead. Jim slows his pace so that he can
talk to Eilis privately.
JIM
How is your mother?
EILIS
Oh, she’s...Well, she’s sad. (Beat)
And she’s got much older, very
quickly.
JIM
(sincerely)
It was a terrible thing. We all
went to the funeral Mass. My mother
and father and myself.
EILIS
I, I didn’t know that.
JIM
My mother played golf with her, you
know. She was very fond of her. It
was... It was the saddest thing to
happen in the town that I can
remember.
Jim is so pained and so genuine that Eilis can only look at
him with gratitude. She can’t speak, and she’s close to
tears.
Thank you.

Eilis, Nancy and George watch as Jim pays for the round of
drinks at the bar: pints for the men, gin and bitter lemons
for the girls.
JIM
We can stand at the bar, George,
can’t we? And the ladies can have
their gossip over there.
He gestures towards a quiet table in the corner of the room.
After the conversation she had with Jim on the way in, Eilis
feels awkward.
EILIS
Oh, we’re not going to talk about
anything terribly exciting.
NANCY
(disappointed)
Oh, really? You’ve got nothing to
tell me?
JIM
I’d love to hear something about
New York. If I promise not to say
anything, can I listen?
Later. Jim, George and Nancy are listening to Eilis talking
about her new life.
EILIS
Ah, but that’s Manhattan. I live in
Brooklyn, and I work in Brooklyn,
and if I go out, I go out in
Brooklyn, and the skyscrapers are
across the river. I don’t even
think about them, very often.
NANCY
But you’ve made friends?
EILIS
Oh, the girls in the house aren’t
so bad, once you get used to them.
NANCY
You don’t make it sound very
glamorous.
EILIS
It’s not, really.

Bartocci’s? It sells lovely things.
But I can’t afford many of them,
and I don’t like the work.
JIM
What would you like to do?
EILIS
I want to do what Rose did. I want
to work in an office, and deal with
numbers. That’s why I’ve been
studying so hard.
JIM
You should call in at Davis’s. They
haven’t managed to replace Rose,
you know. We do business with them,
and they’ve been looking, but they
can’t find anyone who’s reliable
and qualified.
EILIS
I’ll be going back to New York
straight after the wedding.
JIM
But you might want to earn a little
money in the meantime. I’m sure
they’d be glad to have you.
GEORGE
(teasing)
Oh, you just want her to stay.
JIM
I’m only thinking of Eilis.
He says this ambiguously, and with a smile. He doesn’t mind
being teased, and he certainly doesn’t mind being teased on
this particular subject.
GEORGE
D’you hear that, Eilis? He’s only
thinking of you.
Eilis blushes. She makes eye contact with Jim, and she looks
away first.

MARY
How was your evening?
EILIS
It was very nice, thank you.
MARY
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the
car with them?
It was.

EILIS

Mary raises her eyebrows quizzically. Eilis isn’t biting.
MARY
His parents are moving, you know.
They’re retiring to the country.
He’ll be in that big house on his
own.
EILIS
Is that right?
MARY
He’s a catch for someone. (Beat)
Did you see the air-mail letter
that came for you?
EILIS
No. Thank you.
She’s embarrassed by something. Mary studies her.
MARY
One of your new friends in America,
I suppose.
EILIS
I expect so. Goodnight, Mummy.

Eilis rushes into the bedroom, sits on the bed, tears open

bustles out of the front room into the hall.
MARY
Oh, thank goodness you’re back.
EILIS
(alarmed)
What’s the matter?
MARY
A lad from Davis’s came round. They
have a problem in their accounts
department and they need you up
there straight away.
EILIS
(relieved)
Is that all? I’ll just put the
shopping away.
MARY
No, no, leave it. Straight away,
the young fella said.
EILIS
It doesn’t matter what he said,
Mother. I’m not an employee. I’d be
doing them a favour.
MARY
Please, let me do the shopping.
She blocks Eilis’s way, takes the bags off her impatiently.
Eilis sighs, turns around, goes out of the door.

MARIA, a woman in her mid-thirties, ushers Eilis through a
large outer office where several people are working into a
smaller office. On the desk there is a framed photograph of
Eilis. She sees it immediately, but doesn’t say anything.
MARIA
The problem is that it’s our busy
season, so all the drivers and millworkers did overtime last week.

She picks a pile of slips up off the desk.
MARIA
But there’s been nobody to work it
all out and add it to their wage
slips, and some of the men have
started to complain. And I can’t
blame them. As you can see, it’s
all a terrible mess.
EILIS
If you leave me for a couple of
hours, I can work out a system so
that whoever comes in after me
won’t have any trouble. I’ll come
and find you if I have any
questions.
MARIA
You’re sure you don’t need me in
here?
I’m sure.

EILIS

Later. Eilis is completely absorbed in her work - this, after
all, is what she has always wanted to do.
At the end of the day, the office is in impeccable shape Eilis has tidied up all the overtime slips, and has wage
packets lined up in alphabetical order in a box. Just as she
is standing up to go, there is a perfunctory knock on the
door and MR BROWN, owner of Davis’s, walks in.
MR BROWN
Hello, Eilis. Maria has been
telling me that you’ve done the
most marvellous job here. We should
have known you would, of course.
You’re Rose’s sister, after all.
Thank you.

EILIS

MR BROWN
I’m told you have a certificate in
book-keeping. Is it American bookkeeping?
EILIS
I got the certificate in America,
but the two systems are very
similar.

continue on a part-time basis.
Let’s see how that goes, and then
we’ll speak again.
EILIS
I will be going back to the United
States soon.
MR BROWN
As I say. Let’s you and I speak
again before we make any firm
decisions one way or the other.
Eilis hesitates for a moment.

Now, if you go and see Maria,
she’ll have your money for today.

A gorgeous, sunny, windy August day. Nancy, George, Eilis and

towels and bathing suits. Down beneath them is a gloriously
empty sandy beach.

I’d forgotten.
What?
This.

NANCY

walkers here later.
EILIS

Yes, I’m sure. It’s still not the
same.
JIM
I’m sure it’s not. (Sadly) We
don’t really know anything of the
rest of the world. We must seem
very backward to you now.
EILIS
Of course not. You seem calm, and
civilized. And charming.
To her own amazement, Eilis is flirting.

The four make their way down the path to the beach. George
holds Nancy’s hand as she jumps down the last big step; Jim
offers his hand to Eilis. She hesitates, and then takes it.
There is a moment between them as she reaches the sand.

EXT. BEACH. DAY

Jim and Eilis walk behind Nancy and George along the beach.
JIM
My mother wanted you to know that
the golf club is inaugurating a
prize in Rose’s name. A special
trophy, for the best score by a
lady newcomer at the club. She was
always very nice to the newcomers,

Lacey Trophy?
JIM
Every year. As long as there’s a
golf club.
Eilis starts to walk again, lost in thought.
JIM
I think my mother would like you to
come along and present it to the
first winner. Oh, and she’d like to
meet you, by the way. I’m supposed
to arrange a time when you can come
for tea.
EILIS
Thank you. I’d like that. (Beat) I
wish it had been like this before I
went. Before Rose died.
Like what?

JIM

EILIS
There was no place for me here
before. And now...I have a job, and
She makes a vague gesture, which seems to include Jim, and
trails off.
NANCY
(off in the distance)
Here?
She dumps the towels where she is standing.
Later. Nancy, George and Jim are engaged in the age-old and
inelegant struggle between towels and immodesty, as they try
to put their bathing costumes on. They hop on one leg, curse
and giggle. Eilis takes off her blouse and skirt to reveal
the bathing costume (and more of the tan) that she got in
America. Nancy and George are impressed with the simplicity
of the idea; Jim is just impressed generally.
NANCY
Is that an American trick?
EILIS
Yes. It’s a good one, isn’t it?

Eilis were at Coney Island; Eilis and Jim are further apart,
of course, but by no means distant, and playful with each
other. Music - the score at this point is wistful, regretful,
heartbreaking.
TONY (V.O.)
(in a halting, unconfident
monotone)
Dear Eilis, I hope that you are
doing well in Ireland. I hope that
your mother is feeling less sad. It
will not be long before your friend
gets married and you can come home.
127

INT. OFFICE. DAY

127

Eilis back at Davis’s, in her one-woman accounts department.
She’s animated, confident, her intelligence alive in her
face. She’s tallying up a row of figures in a ledger. On the
desk, there is a framed photograph of Rose. A driver knocks
on the door, she smiles, hands him a wage packet.
TONY (V.O.)
This week it is like the whole
world’s basements are flooding. I
have fixed three. I have been
working hard. I have been saving
money.
TONY (V.O.)
Everybody asks me about you all the
time.
FRANKIE (V.O.)
You missed out an ‘e’ I think. It’s
“everybody”.

EXT. BEACH. EVENING

A different beach. Jim and Eilis, walking along the water’s
edge, carrying their shoes.
TONY (V.O.)
Anyway, I think that is all my
news. Mom and Dad and my brothers
all say hello.

INT. KITCHEN, EILIS’S HOUSE. NIGHT

130

Mary gets up from her armchair, pulls back the curtains. She
sees Jim’s car parked outside on the street.
TONY (V.O.)
I think about you most minutes of
most days. Even when I go to see
the Dodgers I do not concentrate on
the games. (To Frankie) I guess I
got “concentrate” wrong, right?
Mary peers intently into the darkness. She, like us, can see
Eilis and Jim kissing chastely.
TONY (V.O.)
With love, your Tony. (Beat) So how
should I change it?
Mary smiles.
131

INT. EILIS’S HOUSE. DAY

131

Eilis comes in from work. On the hall table there is an
airmail letter. She picks it up. She is about to open it
there and then, but she decides not to.
132

INT. BEDROOM. DAY

132

Eilis sits down on the bed with the letter. She stares at the
crude but neat handwriting. She goes to open it again - and
again, she can’t bring herself to do it.
Close on the top drawer of the chest of drawers by Eilis’s
bed. Her hand opens the drawer, puts the letter on top of
several other identical letters, all apparently unopened.
132A

INT. CONNAUGHT HOTEL. EVENING

132A

Jim and Eilis are eating at the Connaught. Jim is wearing a
blazer, and he’s nervous. Eilis recognises his nerves and his
vulnerablity, and she’s grateful for them.
EILIS
No hair oil. And that’s not a
blazer, it’s a sports jacket. Have
you come out in disguise, Jim
Farrell? Are you trying to trick
me?
Jim laughs self-deprecatingly, blushes, and smooths his hair,
embarrassed.

JIM
I knew what you meant, when you
said we’re all the same. And it
made me think that my life must
seem very easy to you. I’m going to
run my father’s bar, and I’m going
to live in my parents’ house. I can
see what that must look like from
the outside. But it doesn’t feel
like that.
EILIS
What does it feel like?
Jim thinks.
Later. Eilis is eating a roast dinner. Jim doesn’t seem to
have touched the food on his plate. He is in full flow.
JIM
And I’ve never been anywhere. I
have never even been to England.
I’d like to see London, and Paris,
and Rome. And New York. It
frightens me, the thought of dying
without ever leaving Ireland. And
there are other things, too...
Later. They are drinking coffee.
JIM
I’m sorry. I wanted to ask you a
thousand things and all I’ve done
is talked.
I’m glad.
Really?
Yes.

EXT. CHURCHYARD. DAY

It’s the day of Nancy and George’s wedding. Jim, Eilis and

the back.

JIM
(smiling)
We’ll find the second-best seats in
the house, then. Would you like me
to run ahead and save a couple of
places, Mrs Lacey?
MARY
Would you mind, Jim? That would be
grand.
Jim walks briskly ahead.
MARY
He’s a real gentleman, isn’t he?
EILIS
(neutral)
He is.
MARY
He came along at just the right
time for us.
Eilis says nothing.
MARY
Is he why you changed your ticket
again?
EILIS
Oh, no. They need me at Davis’s too
much for me to think about going
for a week or two, that’s all.
134

INT. CHURCH. DAY

134

Nancy and George getting married. Nancy is looking into
George’s eyes and reciting her vows.
NANCY
I promise to be true to you in good
times and in bad, in sickness and
in health. I will love you and
honour you all the days of my life.
We see Jim, Eilis and Mary in the congregation. Jim tries to
steal a sideways glance at Eilis, but she won’t catch his
eye, and, to Jim at least, her expression is unreadable certainly she’s not smiling. If anything, she looks afraid.

EXT. CHURCHYARD. DAY

135

As Nancy and George get into the car that will take them to
the church and the reception, Eilis has been caught by one of
Mary’s friends, Mrs Byrne.
MRS BYRNE
(knowingly)
Your mother tells me you things are
working out for you very well in
Enniscorthy, Eilis.
Eilis doesn’t know what to say.
EILIS
It was a lovely service.
MRS BYRNE
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving
out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...
EILIS
(abrupt)
Yes, I know. (Beat) Jim and I
promised my mother we’d take her
back to the car. She says she can’t
remember where we parked it.
MRS BYRNE
Oh, do you hear that? “Jim and I!
Jim and I!”. It won’t be long now,
by the sound of it, and your mother
will have a wonderful day out.
Eilis smiles thinly.
EILIS
Will you excuse me?
136

INT. WEDDING RECEPTION. NIGHT

136

Jim and Eilis are slow-dancing to the band, along with
several other couples, in the ballroom of the hotel. It’s
clearly the fag-end of the evening, and many of the older
people have gone home, apart from those too incapable of
stirring themselves.
JIM
Can we talk?
Eilis pulls her face away, looks at him.
EILIS
What about?

JIM
About...Well, the future.
Eilis takes a breath. She can guess what’s coming.
Yes.

EILIS

JIM
I can’t just let you go back to
America without saying anything.
I’d regret it for the rest of my
life. So: I don’t want you to go. I
want you to stay here, with me.
Eilis stiffens perceptibly.
JIM
And that means asking you another
question, I know that, but I don’t
want to bombard you. I’ll save that
one for later.
He looks at her expectantly. She shrugs helplessly.
EILIS
Thank you. (Beat) I’m...I’m
grateful. And I’m flattered.
JIM
But that’s all?
EILIS
No. No, of course not. It’s
just...I had imagined a different
life for myself.
JIM
I understand. But your life here
could be just as good. Better,
even, maybe.

Eilis returns to her previous position: she holds Jim close
to her, and puts her head on his shoulder. That way she can
demonstrate how she feels without having to say any more.
137

INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT

137

Eilis is sitting on her bed surrounded by Tony’s letters. She
has an air-mail pad on her knee and a pen is poised above the
paper. She starts to write.
Dear Tony,

EILIS (V.O.)

She stops again. There’s a pause.
EILIS (V.O.)
Thank you for your letters.
Another pause.
I want you to know that...
She stops again.
EILIS
(out loud, agonised) I don’t know
what I want you to know.
138

EXT. THE FARRELL HOUSE. DAY

138

Jim lives on the edge of Enniscorthy, in a pretty detached
house set back from the road. It’s not big, but it’s bigger
than her mother’s house. His car turns into the gravel drive.
He jumps out, runs round, opens the door for Eilis, who is
wearing Sunday best, a nicely-cut dress that she couldn’t
have bought in Ireland.
139

EXT. GARDEN. DAY

139

Mrs Farrell, a large, homely, pleasant woman is pouring tea
for Eilis in the small back garden of the house. Jim and
Eilis are sitting on chairs at the garden table; Jim’s father
is sitting away from them, smoking a pipe on a bench at the
end of the garden. It’s a hot day, but there is plenty of
shade.
MRS FARRELL
(to her husband)
Will you finish that wretched pipe
and sit with us?
MR FARRELL
I can hear perfectly well from
where I am.

MRS FARRELL
We’re not here to provide you with
entertainment.
MR FARRELL
Oh, don’t you worry. I found that
out many years ago.
Jim rolls his eyes at Eilis. She smiles.
MRS FARRELL
(provocatively quiet)
Just ignore him, Eilis. It’s as
well Jim takes after me, not him.
MR FARRELL
(shouting)
Speak up!
EILIS
(a little louder than
necessary)
Are you looking forward to your
move?
MRS FARRELL
(still quiet)
Ah, we’ll miss Enniscorthy. But
it’s lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
Over on the bench, Mr Farrell puts down his pipe in
irritation and stomps over to join them.
JIM
Mother’s worried about leaving me
here on my own. She thinks I’ll
destroy the place.
MRS FARRELL
(carefully)
I’m hoping you won’t be on your own
forever.
EILIS
I’m sure he won’t.
Almost before the words are out of her mouth, Eilis can see
that she’s said more than she meant to, and we can see she
feels panicky. She tries to clarify her position.
I mean..

EILIS

But she can’t find words with the necessary ambiguity unsurprisingly, given that she doesn’t know what she feels.
Mrs Farrell looks at Jim meaningfully.

It’s clear that Eilis has her approval. Jim smiles. He looks
happy and proud - and, to us, vulnerable.
140

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

140

Eilis standing at Rose’s grave. She has just left fresh
flowers by the headstone.
EILIS
You’re the only person I can talk
to, Rose. There’s nobody else. Not
Tony, my husband. My husband! Not
Jim. Not mother. Oh, Rose. Can you
imagine If I told mummy that I was
going to marry Jim? That would be
everything she wanted. She wouldn’t
be alone. And I could be happy, I
know I could. I’d be happy with Jim
here, at home. And I could be happy
with Tony in America. I know that,
too... I wish I could do nothing. I
wish I could float above it all,
watching. Like you.
141

EXT. EILIS’S HOUSE, STREET. DAY

141

Eilis has just returned from visiting Rose’s grave. She is
about to walk down the path into her house when she sees
Mary, Miss Kelly’s shop assistant, walking towards her
briskly.
Mary!

EILIS

MARY
I was just coming to fetch you.
EILIS
(amused)
To fetch me? I haven’t worked for
Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary. I
may call in to see her soon, if
that’s what she wants.
MARY
(anxious)
Please come, Eilis. She told me not
to come back without you. You know
what she’s like.

MISS KELLY
You look after things for five
minutes while I’m upstairs with
Eilis, please, Mary. There are no
customers in there at the moment,
so I don’t think you can make too
much of a mess of things.
She leads Eilis round the side of the shop, where there is an
entrance to Miss Kelly’s home above the shop. She opens the
door without saying anything, and Eilis follows her inside.
143

INT. MISS KELLY’S FRONT ROOM. DAY

143

A dingy room, full of old furniture and dust and no colour.
We see the dust motes in the afternoon sunlight. Eilis and
Miss Kelly enter the room, and Miss Kelly sits down in an
armchair. She gestures at Eilis to sit on a smaller armchair
facing her. Eilis perches on it, unwilling to relax.
MISS KELLY
So. How have you been getting on?
EILIS
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
MISS KELLY
I heard that you’re working over at
Davis’s? In the accounts
department?
EILIS
That’s right.
MISS KELLY
And there’s lots of talk about you
and young Jim Farrell.
EILIS
Ah, well. You know what people are
like. They love to talk.
Miss Kelly smiles to herself.
MISS KELLY
Yes. Do you remember Mrs Brady?
Eilis thinks, or pretends to.
MISS KELLY
She usually comes into the shop on
Sunday morning for her rashers.
This hasn’t helped. Eilis still looks blank.

MISS KELLY
No? Well, you have a very busy life
now. What with one thing and
another.
Miss Kelly pauses for a moment. She’s enjoying unsettling
Eilis.
MISS KELLY
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece
living in Brooklyn.
Eilis is now beginning to feel uneasy - we can almost see the
chill that is beginning to run through her.
MISS KELLY
The world is a small place, isn’t
it? She had a letter from her a
couple of weeks back.
EILIS
And what did it say?
MISS KELLY
Oh, only that she’d been to a
wedding at the registry office, and
her husband had bumped into a girl
from Enniscorthy who was getting
married there.
EILIS
I’m not sure what you’re telling
me, Miss Kelly. He didn’t bump into
me.
This has only the virtue of being literally true. Eilis is
visibly shaking. Miss Kelly is loving this. There is
unambiguous pleasure on her face.
MISS KELLY
Oh, you can’t fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I’m not sure that’s your
name any longer, is it? He couldn’t
remember. Something Italian, he
thought.
Suddenly, Eilis finds the will to resist her.
EILIS
(quietly)
I’d forgotten.
MISS KELLY

You’d forgotten! What a thing for-

Miss Kelly? Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn’t even know.
Perhaps it was enough for you to
know that you could ruin me.
She stands up.
EILIS
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
She meets Miss Kelly’s stare and then leaves the room.

Minutes later. Eilis is leaning against the wall in a

rings. She answers it immediately.

to make a reservation for the next
available sailing from Cobh to New
York....

Eilis and Mary, eating their dinner. Eilis is drawn,
distracted; Mary is content and chatty. We join her in midflow.
MARY
I think people even spend more
money after a wedding. Nancy’s
mother must have been in every shop
in the town. She was buying
firelighters in Broom’s.
Firelighters! In August!

But she’d seen Mrs Stapleton in

detail with her, so...
Finally Mary notices her tears.
MARY
Eilis, what’s the matter? Has
something happened with Jim?
EILIS
Mummy, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m
married. I got married in Brooklyn
before I came home. I should have
told you. I should have told you
the minute I got back.
Mary puts down her knife and fork. She holds on to the table,
as if to steady herself.
MARY
And you kept it from me all this
time?
Eilis closes her eyes. She cannot bear the pain she is
causing her mother.
MARY
So you’re going back?
Eilis nods.
EILIS
Yes. Tomorrow.
A very brief expression of shock appears on her mother’s
face.
EILIS
I want to be with him. I want to be
with my husband.
MARY
Of course. Is he nice?
Yes.

EILIS

MARY
(softly, heartbroken)
He would have to be nice, if you
married him. The letters that
came... I didn’t want to ask.

EILIS
Oh, mummy...It’s not even eight
o’clock. You don’t have to..
MARY
I’m very tired. And I’d rather say
goodbye now, and only once.
Eilis stands up and they embrace.
MARY
If you weren’t married, would you
still be going back?

Yes.

EILIS
(helplessly)

And then, recognising that this admission causes fresh
pain...
EILIS
I don’t know.
MARY
Perhaps you’ll write to me about
him when you get back?
I will.

EILIS

MARY
Thank you. Have a safe journey.
Goodnight, Eilis.
She walks out of the room, dignified, determined, broken.
Eilis sits back down at the dinner table and puts her head in

Yes, it’s just like home.
The girl smiles gratefully. Eilis turns away. Suddenly she

EXT. HOUSE IN BROOKLYN. DAY

Eilis is leaning against a wall opposite a three-story
brownstone in Brooklyn. She has her eyes closed as she soaks
up the last of a late-summer sunny day. The front door of the
brownstone opens, and two men, dressed in overalls and
carrying tools, come out chatting. One of them is Tony. Eilis
sees him before he sees her, and the camera stays on him for
a moment - we notice his openness, his good humour, his
innocence.
EILIS (V.O.)
And you’ll realise that this is
where your life is.
Tony sees her. He stops in his tracks, smiles broadly, runs
across the road. For a moment he’s worried about the
reception he’s getting. Eilis’s expression is difficult to
read, and for a moment he looks at her anxiously, but she
opens her arms to him. Freeze on their embrace.
