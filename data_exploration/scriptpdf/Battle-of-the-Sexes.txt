MONTAGE

Huge on the screen, A plastic doll stares at us. A commercial
for Talky Crissy.
TALKY CRISSY
Hi! Please dry my hair.
V/O
All girls love Talky Crissy with
her growing hair....
The screen divides in two to accommodate both Talky Crissy
and a squadron of B52s unloading its cargo. Hundreds of bombs
unzip the sky.
V/O (CONT’D)
... as the last US ground troops
are withdrawn from Vietnam, the
bombing continues...
The screen divides into smaller squares accommodating the
best and the worst of the early 1970’s. Clips of Hawaii FiveO, Here’s Lucy, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, stills from
commercials, documentary footage from Town Bloody Hall, each
taking centre screen for a few seconds and then shrinking to
allow the next clip to take precedence.
“The Kenwood Chef does everything but cook. That’s what wives
are for”.
“Flying Dutchman tobacco: lead Women around by the nose”.
“Don’t worry, darling, you didn’t burn the beer. Schlitz
Malt”.
Then a news clip takes centre screen:
NEWSCASTER
Good evening, in a landmark ruling,
the Supreme Court today legalized
abortions. A majority from Texas
and Georgia said that the decision
to end a pregnancy during the first
three months belongs to a woman and
her doctor not the government.
Town Bloody Hall takes precedence as a woman in the audience
accuses Norman Mailer on the stage.
TOWN BLOODY HALL
...the dog talks, you know! That a
woman should talk at all is
something you are finding a little
hard to take...

But there’s someone new in town.

EXT. FOREST HILLS TENNIS COURT. US OPEN. DAY.

1A

BILLIE JEAN KING’s 29 year-old face, big on the screen,
concentrating hard. We hear a grunt and the noise of a serve.
A flash and Billie Jean has reached the ball, returned it.
The ball comes back, but she is across the court with
lightning speed and putting every ounce of energy into the
shot, returns it again.
We are inside her head: only the sound of her furious
breathing, the ball and the squeak of tennis shoes can be
heard.
Back comes the ball, again and again, each time, Billie Jean
punches it back until....
...The world crashes in: a sudden surge of applause and
cheering. The focus on Billie Jean’s face finally relaxes
into a huge smile of triumph.
UMPIRE V/O
Game, set and match to Miss King.
She throws the racket high into the air and we see she is

LARRY KING, Billie Jean’s husband, jumps onto the court and
embraces her.

On the TV, Billie Jean is on court holding up the trophy from
the US Open.
The TV cuts to a boardroom where she is now talking on a
speaker-phone to PRESIDENT NIXON.
BILLIE JEAN
Hello, Mister President.
PRESIDENT NIXON V/O
I just wanted to congratulate you
on your great successes this year

Bobby switches off the TV with a sigh. He bats a ball of
scrunched up paper expertly into the trash, wanders back
behind a large, largely empty desk. He sets the Newton’s
Cradle desk toy going, his eyes following it’s progress back
and forth for a while.

BOBBY RIGGS
At least that’s what Priscilla

His face briefly shines and then he remembers.
BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
She’s gonna leave me unless I quit
gambling.
A couple of ‘we hear you, Bobby’s from the room.
BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
Puzzles me, this word: gambling.
Every time she gets the car out the

That’s the thrill of it: this way

heads or the tails of being alive!
Yet here I am and here you are,
heads bowed, ashamed of ourselves.
But that ain’t right. You fellas
aren’t here cos you’re gamblerswe’re all gamblers. You’re here cos
you’re terrible gamblers. That’s
what the problem is. You lose,
right? And you end up here.
More ashamed nods from the Gamblers.
BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
I get it. But there’s one thing
worse than losing, friends: it’s
not being in the game. If you’re
not in game, what’s the point?

BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
Heads up, fellas, we can turn this

I see the problem. What you gotta

Yeah, a thing! An edge, an angle,

a gambler to a hustler, from a
loser to a winner. A thing!

A silver trophy on the bedside table, surrounded by dozens of
FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS. Billie Jean’s husband LARRY KING (28,
tall, immaculately dressed) reads the cards that came with
the flowers. Billie Jean is out of sight in the bathroom.
LARRY
Flowers from your parents! We
should have them over when we get
back to California. A home-cooked
meal, wouldn’t that be something?
Billie Jean?
In the bathroom, in a long evening gown, Billie Jean is
putting on earrings. She is lost in her own thoughts.
LARRY (CONT’D)
We should go. Car’s here. Billie?
He goes into the bathroom. Billie-Jean is just staring.
Billie.

LARRY (CONT’D)

BILLIE JEAN
Can we not go?
LARRY
Not go? You’re the champ, honey.
You’re guest of honor!
Then he sees that she’s serious.
LARRY (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?
BILLIE JEAN
It isn’t working, Larry.
LARRY
What isn’t?
BILLIE JEAN
You and me. Us. Being married.
We’re never in the same place at
the same time and when we are, we
don’t make each other happy.
LARRY
I’m happy. And if there’s more I
can do to make you happy, tell me.
BILLIE JEAN
It’s not you, Larry. You know it’s
not.
Larry comes up to her and takes the necklace from her. Starts
to put it on.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

LARRY
We’ve had our moments- which
marriage doesn’t- but we’ve got
through them before and we’ll get
through them again.
The necklace is tied.
LARRY (CONT’D)
There. You look beautiful. A bit
tired maybe which is hardly a
surprise. Stop winning everything,
honey.
A weary smile from Billie.
LARRY (CONT’D)
Tomorrow you’re staying in bed and
I’m doing everything, okay?
BILLIE JEAN
Thank you. You’re a good man, Larry
King.
He offers her his hand.
LARRY
Come on. They can’t start the
dancing without you.

The Tournament Ball. Larry and Billie Jean alone on the dance
floor, waltzing elegantly- the perfect, happy couple. They
are surrounded by hundreds of people in evening dress, all of
whom applaud as the song comes to an end. Larry kisses Billie
Jean and welcomes the rest of the party-goers to join them on
the floor.
GLADYS HELDMAN, a feisty forty-year old marches onto the
floor, interrupting Billie and Larry.
GLADYS

You want a dance?
GLADYS

Gladys waves a piece of paper in front of Billie. Billie
grabs it. Reads.
LARRY
Which low-lifes?
GLADYS
Our so-called friends, the United
States Lawn Tennis Association.
Gladys jabs a finger at one particular line. Billie Jean’s
eyes widen.
BILLIE JEAN
What?! This is outrageous.
GLADYS
It’s got Jack Kramer’s fingerprints
all over it.
BILLIE JEAN
Absolutely right. And I know where
he’s hiding. Come on, Gladys.
She grabs Gladys and they march off the dance floor.
Good luck!

JACK KRAMER and BOB SANDERS are sitting in club chairs,
relaxing. DANA, a young waitress, hands them whiskies.
JACK KRAMER
Thank you, honey.
DANA
Sure, Mister Kramer.
He follows the rear view with his eyes as she goes.
Gladys and Billie Jean come marching in.
GLADYS
Surprised in their lair.
JACK KRAMER
An unexpected pleasure, ladies. You
both look sensational, if I may
say.
GLADYS
You may not.
BOB SANDERS
You’re not supposed to be in here,
you know-GLADYS
- because I’m a woman or a Jew?
JACK KRAMER
Oh, we have a Jewish member now.
Don’t we, Bob?
BOB SANDERS
One black member as well.
Progress!

GLADYS

BILLIE JEAN
But no women.

Jack pats a seat for Gladys, oblivious to the daggers shot
his way.

Glass of something?

Gladys sits, gets out a cigarette. Bob leans forward to light
it. She pointedly lights it herself.
GLADYS
I always find it’s best to be clear
before committing cold-blooded
murder, so, to clarify: the Pacific
Southwest Tournament press release.
She bangs the offending piece of paper down on the coffee
table, rattling the china.
Ah. Yes.

JACK KRAMER

BILLIE JEAN
It says you’re offering twelve
thousand dollars to the men’s
winner and one thousand five
hundred dollars to the women’s.
GLADYS
That’s either a misprint or a
provocation. I might get off with
manslaughter.
JACK KRAMER
No, those are the terms.
BOB SANDERS
The men’s prize has to be that high
to attract the best players. We’re
trying to make this the most
prestigious tournament in America.
GLADYS
And paying the women players less
than ever makes it more
prestigious. Aha. I get it. I see
the logic. Hallelujah, my eyes have
been opened.
-Gladys.

BILLIE JEAN

Said quietly but firmly. Everybody takes notice.
GLADYS
You’re lucky she’s here. She’s like

A huff from Gladys. Silence.

BILLIE JEAN (CONT’D)
Can I just bring it back around to
the money, Jack?
JACK KRAMER
You know I’m sympathetic to your
cause, Billie Jean. We’ve talked
about this-BILLIE JEAN
We have. Many times. You promised
this year would be different.
JACK KRAMER
It’s simply a question of what we
can afford.
BOB SANDERS
People come to see the men play.
They’re the draw.
BILLIE JEAN
Eight times more of a draw?
Sorry?

BOB SANDERS

BILLIE JEAN
You’re offering the men’s winner
exactly eight times more than the
women’s winner. Do we bring in an
eighth of the crowd?
BOB SANDERS
I don’t know the percentages-BILLIE JEAN
They sold the exact same number of
tickets today for the women’s final
as the men’s final. Isn’t that
right, Jack?
JACK
I suppose so.
GLADYS
Same sales, same prize money. Seems
fair to me.
JACK KRAMER
Be reasonable, there’s no way we
can afford that.

12

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16
BILLIE JEAN
Then what’s your argument? Just
give me a logical argument why you
should pay a woman an eighth of
what you pay a man and I promise
I’ll stop asking.
JACK KRAMER
Well, for one thing, the men have
to support their families.
BILLIE JEAN
I’m the main bread winner in my

dollars, a set of car keys.

Bizarrely, two Alsatians are bounding around a tennis court,
Bobby on the end of their lead, being towed after them. On
the other side of the net is JACK, retired business tycoon
and amateur tennis player.
Equally bizarre is the location of the court; on the flat
roof of a skyscraper near the belching smoke stacks of the
Con Edison Power Plant.
Loving the show are the Boys: HANK, ex-baseball pro: retired
KEN and gentle HERB, a tennis star in the 50’s, now in a
wheelchair and LORNIE KUHLE, younger friend of Bobby’s and
tennis pro.
Somehow, Bobby manages to reach the ball and get it back over
the net. The Boys are loving it, the dogs are loving it and
most of all, so is Bobby.
JACK
Dammit, Bobby....
BOBBY RIGGS
Teach them to serve and we could
get them on the Circuit! Good boys,
good boys go, go...
He wins the point.
KEN
A chair. C’mon, guys...
BOBBY RIGGS
Two chairs and I’ll raise you both
five hundred.
KEN/ HERB
Done. Take him, Jack!
Lornie rushes two chairs onto Bobby’s side of the court that
he now has to dodge around with the dogs. Chaos. Bobby is
leaping over the chairs, getting the lead tangled in the
legs...and yet somehow, the ball keeps being returned.
More dollars are put down on the table by the Boys. There’s
big money on this game.
A fierce exchange of shots, culminating in a lot of barking
and a massive lob from Bobby. Everyone watches its progress
high into the sky and then down on the baseline. Right on the
baseline. Jack scrabbles back for it. Doesn’t get there.
Bobby leaps the net, shakes his hand.
BOBBY RIGGS
Good game, Jack.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

JACK
Dammit, I thought I had you this
time, Bobby, I really did.
Dejected, he walks off. The boys watch him go.
BOBBY RIGGS
He keeps betting me. What do I do?
HANK
Thing about Jack is- he can afford
to lose.
Jack gets the car keys from the bowl in the middle of the
table. Throws them to Bobby. Towels his face down.
LORNIE
What’s Priscilla going to say,
Bobby? That’s what you gotta ask
yourself.
BOBBY RIGGS
Don’t spoil it, Jack, you know?
HERB
Priscilla? You still married,
Bobby?
KEN
He sure will be if he turns up in a
Rolls Royce.
LORNIE
He sure won’t be if he turns up in
a Rolls Royce.
HERB
Whadd’ya mean?
LORNIE
You think Priscilla won’t know
where it came from? Even Bobby’s
gonna find it hard talking that one
away. “Hi, honey, this guy on the
corner just gave me a Silver
Shadow...” Think that’ll cut it?
HERB
What’s to talk away? You’ve just
won a damned Rolls Royce.
LORNIE
Herb, Bobby doesn’t gamble anymore.

BOBBY RIGGS
No! I’m Gamblers Anonymous once a

Riggs is as clean as Montana snow.
You are?

KEN

BOBBY RIGGS
Absolutely. A reformed character.
That’s what my psychoanalyst’s
report says and Priscilla’s very
happy about that, I can tell you.
HERB
How did you ever get the shrink to
write that?
BOBBY RIGGS
The chump keeps losing at Black
Jack. But Lornie’s got a point.
It’s a big car to hide in a drawer.
No hurry, Jack.
Bobby throws the keys back.
JACK
You saying I’m not good for a bet?
BOBBY RIGGS
No, I’m just saying keep the engine

Teak lockers, steam coming from the showers, a man on a
massage table getting treatment and a card table. Lots of men
in towels lounging around.
Hank is reading an article about Billie Jean. Bobby is
getting changed. Notices the article.
BOBBY RIGGS
“The hundred thousand dollar girl”.
Don’t see anybody on the Senior

HANK
Reckons she should get more. Same
as the men.
BOBBY RIGGS
She’s not happy with a hundred
thousand dollars, now? That Billie
Jean King. Just what is her
problem?
HANK
It’s all equality this, equality
that now, Bobby. Bra burning and
the like.
BOBBY RIGGS
Why would they pay women the same
as the guys? Why would they?
HERB
I say there’s nothing wrong with
watching a nice girl in a short
skirt running after a ball.
BOBBY RIGGS
No argument there, Jack, but I
could beat any woman on the planet.
Any of them. And what are they
paying me on the Seniors? Anybody
offering me equal prize money? No,
sir. Peanuts, that’s what I’m
getting. Peanuts.
Silence. Then:
HANK
That would be a bet.

Nine tennis player renegades are having their hair done:
Billie Jean King, ROSIE CASALS (El Salvadorian-American),
JULIE HELDMAN (Gladys’s daughter), VALERIE ZIEGENFUSS (very
blonde), PEACHES BARTKOWICZ (Polish-American), NANCY RICHEY
(always knitting), KRISTY PIGEON (only 20), KERRY MELVILLE
REID (English) and JUDY TEGART DALTON (older, Australian).

Gladys smokes as she pays the salon with a personal check.
Billie Jean can’t sit still in the chair where she’s meant to
be having her hair done by MARILYN BARNETT (late twenties).
PEACHES
Gladys? What if some of the men
decide they want to join our tour?
You know, in solidarity?
Billie Jean pops out of her seat. Marilyn’s hands reach after
her, helpless to keep her in the chair.
BILLIE JEAN
No! That’s the whole point! We have
to show everyone we can bring in
the crowds without the men.
ROSIE
How are ticket sales going?
BILLIE JEAN
Good! Fine! We’re working on it!
JULIE HELDMAN
Are we going to have our hair done
before every event? Because I could
get used to this.
Some of the women make noises of agreement.
BILLIE JEAN
Right! Um. Gladys?
Billie Jean sits back in her chair, ceding the floor to
Gladys. Marilyn resumes styling Billie Jean’s hair.
GLADYS
The salon is a once-only, because
the press are here and because I
love you. Tomorrow, the press
aren’t here and I don’t love you.
JULIE
What about me, Mom? You’ll still
love me, right?
Some of the girls laugh.
GLADYS
This is a budget tour, ladies. And
yes, you’ll be sharing rooms, so
you might as well start getting
friendly.
PEACHES
I call bunking with Valerie!

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

ROSIE
I thought you were getting us a
sponsor, Gladys.
GLADYS
I was, I am and I will. Until then,
we’re broke, so shut up.
VALERIE
Wait, what about our prize money?
ROSIE
Why are you worried, Val? You only
get prize money if you win.
Lots of laughter and mock ‘oohs’ from the girls. Billie Jean
pops back out of her chair. Marilyn frowns.
BILLIE JEAN
Listen, everyone. I know how much
you’re risking here, because I’m
risking the exact same thing.
More.

GLADYS

BILLIE JEAN
No. The same. We’re all putting our
careers on the line for this. So I
thank you. For your bravery. And
your balls.
The women applaud and whoop. Billie Jean grins.
GLADYS
All right! You’ve got thirty
minutes until we go face the press!
How long? Outrage from the girls.
GLADYS (CONT’D)
Okay, twenty.
As Gladys passes by Billie, Billie grabs her arm.
BILLIE JEAN
Anything from the USLTA? From Jack?
GLADYS
Not a word. They’re up to
something.
Gladys walks away. HANDS clasp Billie Jean’s shoulders.
Billie Jean looks up at Marilyn, who holds onto her.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

MARILYN
Sit. Please.
BILLIE JEAN
Sorry. I’m excited. Or nervous.
Something.
Billie Jean sits in front of Marilyn. BONNY, the stylist
working on Julie, pipes up:
BONNY
Sounds like you girls are getting
men to pay attention to what you’re
saying for once.
JULIE
You know what would really get
their attention? A sex strike.
PEACHES
Wouldn’t that punish us as much as
the men?
VALERIE
I don’t even think I’d miss it. My
ex went about it like he was fixing
the carburetor on the Oldsmobile.
ROSIE
And he never could get that damned
car to start.
The girls laugh.
MARILYN
(Quiet, to Billie Jean)
At least women know where the
carburetor is. Right?
Billie Jean doesn’t know how to answer. Marilyn leans over so
her face is level with Billie’s, intimate:
MARILYN (CONT’D)
So, Billie Jean. What do you want?
...What?

BILLIE JEAN

MARILYN
With your hair. What do you want to
do with it?
BILLIE JEAN
Oh, um. It doesn’t matter. Just get
it out of my face.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

24

MARILYN
You don’t care what you look like?
Someone as pretty as you?
BILLIE JEAN
What? No. I’m not pretty. I mean
thank you. But that’s not me.
MARILYN
If you say so.
Billie Jean can’t look away from this woman’s direct gaze.
BILLIE JEAN
What’s your name again?
MARILYN
Marilyn Barnett. You’re all tennis
players?
BILLIE JEAN
Yeah. You don’t watch tennis?
MARILYN
I don’t own a TV.
Marilyn runs her fingers through her hair. It feels good.
Billie Jean closes her eyes. Her face relaxes. She opens her
eyes, feeling caught.
BILLIE JEAN
Sorry. That feels nice.
We’re close on her face, Marilyn’s hands. It’s sensual.
BILLIE JEAN (CONT’D)
What is that? Is that perfume?
MARILYN
I like to put lavender oil on my
wrists. To relax the customer.
Marilyn leans over so her face is next to Billie Jean’s.
MARILYN (CONT’D)
Why don’t you let me give you a
trim? You’ll come out feeling like
a new person.
BILLIE JEAN
I don’t think a haircut has ever
made me feel anything like that.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4/7/16

25

MARILYN
Well, you’ve never had me cut your
hair. Relax. I promise I’ll make
you happy.
Marilyn goes to work on Billie Jean’s hair. Billie Jean
watches her in the mirror, transfixed in spite of herself.

stylish. She watches Marilyn sweep up.
BILLIE JEAN
Thanks again. I really like what
you did with it.
MARILYN
It was my pleasure. Good luck.
Rosie bangs on the window. They’re late.
Coming!

BILLIE JEAN

Billie Jean roots around in her bag, pulls out some fliers.
She hands them out to various HAIR DRESSERS in the salon.
BILLIE JEAN (CONT’D)
Here. We’re playing in San Diego
next month.
Billie Jean hands a flier to Marilyn. Marilyn smiles. Billie
Jean looks away, nervous.
BILLIE JEAN (CONT’D)
Okay. I gotta run. Bye.
And Billie Jean is out the door. Marilyn watches her go.
Bonny comes over, fanning herself with the flier.
BONNY
You think she knows she’s gay?
MARILYN
Dunno. But she sure she knows I am.
Billie Jean peers back over her shoulder. Eye contact.
Marilyn waves. Billie Jean quickly turns away.

He nods. There at the back is Jack Kramer. Billie moves out
of the line-up and walks through the Press.
Jack.

BILLIE JEAN

JACK
Billie Jean, what you’re doing

BILLIE JEAN
Are you here to give us another

JACK
On behalf of the USLTA, I’m here to
ask you girls not to do anything
hasty.
BILLIE JEAN
So what are you offering? Equal
prize money? Women at every
tournament?
JACK
I’m offering to keep you in the
United States Lawn Tennis
Association.
BILLIE JEAN
You’re throwing us out?
JACK
If you do this, you’re becoming our
rivals. We’ll have no option.

BILLIE JEAN
We’ll miss your pretty face, Jack,
but go right ahead.
The Nine are sat, waiting, though there’s still a hubbub
surrounding them.
GLADYS
Hey, Billie Jean!
BILLIE JEAN
One minute.
JACK
I’m not sure you understand. If
you’re not in the USLTA, you can’t
play the Grand Slams. No Wimbledon,
no Palm Springs, no nothing.
BILLIE JEAN
Oh, I get it. But what will your
Grand Slams be without the best
women players in the world? Not so
grand. I appreciate you coming,
but if you’ve got nothing to offer,
I’ve got a contract to sign. Bye,
Jack.
She walks away. Larry is waiting with paperwork.
A deal?

LARRY

BILLIE JEAN
Nope. No deal.
So do it.

LARRY

He hands a pen to Billie Jean. She looks Larry in the eyes.
BILLIE JEAN
We’re really doing this.
LARRY
Proud of you.
She adds her signature to the list on the contract. Larry
hands her a dollar bill.
LARRY (CONT’D)
You’re in. One dollar. Don’t spend
it all at once.
She goes to join the Nine.

GLADYS
Okay, hold that dollar bill up! Are
we at a funeral, or what? Smile!
Flash guns pop. The Nine hold out their dollar bills. Through
a fixed grin...
BILLIE JEAN
Keep smiling, ladies, but we’ve
just been thrown out of the USLTA.
GLADYS
Give old Jack a wave, girls. Don’t
let him see you care.
And they wave their dollar bills at him, standing motionless
in the doorway.

Yeah. A dollar. Remember that,
ladies. One dollar.

not compared to most of the kids
who went there. They were doing a

some white shorts- couldn’t afford
to buy a tennis skirt. Anyway,
there we were, all lined up and the
guy who ran the club, Perry Jones,
pointed at me and told me to get
out of the shot. Because I was
poor. I wasn’t dressed right. I
vowed, I absolutely vowed right
there, that I would change that.
And the only way I can change
anything, the only way I can have a

Larry’s in the building.
BILLIE JEAN
Oh. Shit. Right. Thanks.
Billie Jean scrambles to her feet, glances around the room
rather desperately. Grabs a robe. Shoves a short skirt and
tights under a pillow, tidies the bed, plumping one set of
pillows to look unslept in. Hides Marilyn’s suitcase under
the bed. She eyes the results dubiously.

Larry is waiting for the elevator when Marilyn comes down the

BILLIE JEAN
Larry, I’m sorry to call so late,
but I need you and it can’t wait.
LARRY
Quit apologizing. We’re married,
you can call any time. What’s
wrong?
BILLIE JEAN
Bobby Riggs beat Margaret Court.
LARRY
I was watching. It was a travesty.
BILLIE JEAN
You think I can beat him, right?
LARRY
Riggs? In a heartbeat.
BILLIE JEAN
Then call the bozo. Tell him it’s
on. But nothing gets agreed on
without my approval. Venue, date,
TV rights. Everything. Which balls
we use. I know Bobby, he’ll be
doing deals on his deals by now.
LARRY
I’ll reach out first thing in the

No, now. He calls me at midnight.

against Julie Heldman. Looking
tired and dispirited, Miss King
left the court after only one set,

No. I won’t play.

JACK KRAMER
Billie Jean, I know we’ve had our
differences, but that’s behind us.
This is between you and Bobby now.
BILLIE JEAN
Bobby? Bobby’s a clown. The whole
thing’s a big act for him. With
you, it’s different. It’s for real.
JACK KRAMER
What do you mean.
BILLIE JEAN
Your dislike of women.
JACK KRAMER
Happily married for thirty-two
years.
He spreads his hands? Go figure.
BILLIE JEAN
Oh, you like us well enough in the
kitchen and the bedroom, bringing
up the kids and doing the dishes. I
bet you’re a real gentleman- and I
mean that sincerely.
JACK KRAMER
I’ll take my compliments where I
can from you.
BILLIE JEAN
It’s when we dare to want more,
just a little bit of what you’ve
got. That’s what you can’t stand.
And to have you up there, telling
the American public what to read
into every serve, every point? I’m
sorry, Jack, but if you’re
commentating, I’m not playing.
Jack drops the smile.
JACK KRAMER
How do you think that will make the
great Billie Jean King look?
Backing out at the last minute
because she didn’t like the
commentator?

because he didn’t get to
participate.
Stalemate. Jack considers, shakes his head.
JACK KRAMER
No. This means too much to you. You
and your Sisterhood. You’d never
throw it over this.
BILLIE JEAN
Remember the last time you thought
I was bluffing? One dollar.
He stares at her for a moment. Points to her hands. They are
shaking.
