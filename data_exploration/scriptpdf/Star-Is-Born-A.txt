We hear: A distant crowd becoming restless.

A guitar

The crowd’s cheers morph into “JACKSON... JACKSON...
JACKSON.”
FADE IN:
INT. DOME TENT - BACKSTAGE - DUSK
SILHOUETTE OF A MAN IN A HAT, head down.

Spits... Then --

EMERGING FROM THE DARKNESS: JACKSON (JACK) MAINE (early
40s) pulls out a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE, dumps a FEW
PILLS into his hand -- knocks them back -- drinks deeply
from a GIN ON THE ROCKS, the alcohol spilling down his
beard... the awaiting crowd just off in the b.g... A MALE
ROADIE slaps him on the back.
JACK
All right, let’s do it.
He walks onto -INT. DOME TENT - MAIN STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The crowd erupting. With a wave, he flings off his hat
and wields his guitar, his RHYTHM GUITARIST now opposite
him...
And at once in tandem they unleash dueling guitars with
the sheer force of rock ‘n’ roll -- an explosion of sound
as the speakers scream his latest hit, “BLACK EYES” -JACK
(singing)
‘Black eyes open wide,
It’s time to testify,
There’s no room for lies,
And everyone's waitin’ for you,
And I'm gone,
Sittin’ by the phone,
And I'm all alone,
By the wayside,’
The stage lights blaze from above as the song reaches its
fever pitch... He may be a little drunk, but this is
Jackson Maine in his element, a singer-songwriter with a
mean guitar. He doesn’t just play, it’s an all-out
attack. And as the song ends, we go --

Camera flashes zip by across his face... stadium lighting

PAN ALONG the bottom of a number of stalls. The bathroom
seemingly empty... Until we hear a HUSHED VOICE and see
two feet in heels in a stall down at the end.
ALLY (O.S.)
(into phone)
Roger... You're a wonderful man,
yes, and you're a great lawyer.
We're just not meant to be
together.
ANOTHER ANGLE - INSIDE THE STALL
ALLY CAMPANA, (early 30s) is on her cell phone.
ALLY
(into phone)
No, I don’t wanna marry you -- are
you crazy?!? The hell's the
matter with you? Roger, we're
done. Oh, God.
She hangs up, opens the door to the stall, and screams
bloody murder.
ALLY
Fucking men!
She pulls herself together.
INT. BILTMORE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
She walks PAST various CATERING SERVERS AND STAFF with
her best friend RAMON -- he’s an aspiring dancer with a
sinewy body like a swimmer, flamboyant, wonderful.
RAMON
Did he cry?
ALLY
He cried. He laughed. He yelled
at me. You know, whatever.

Ally rolls her

RAMON
Come on, Bryan! She’s performing
tonight!
ALLY
Here we go. Taking out the trash.
Like your mouth.
BRYAN
I'll let you go early, but you
gotta finish your job.
ALLY
Well, you gotta keep your mouth
clean. Okay?
CUT TO:
EXT. BILTMORE - TRASH AREA - NIGHT
Ally tosses a bag of trash into the dumpster... She hums
to herself, just audible over the LOUD TRASH COMPACTOR...

‘When all the world is a hopeless
jumble,
And the raindrops tumble all

And as Ally ascends the tunnel into the night...

A STAR IS BORN
INT. JACK’S SUV (MOVING) - LATER THAT NIGHT
The driver, PHIL, 40s, looks into the rearview mirror
back to Jack, slumped against the window. Then, after a
while...
JACK
Where the fuck are we?
PHIL
East of the city.
JACK
(re: alcohol)
Is there any more?
PHIL
Sorry, Jack. And it's about an
hour-forty with traffic till we
get there.
JACK
Wait, really?
PHIL
Yeah.
JACK
Bet we can find something around
here.
PHIL
I'll find something.

JACK
How’s your kid? How old is he
now?
PHIL
He is 17.
JACK
Fuck me.
PHIL
He got a scholarship to play
baseball in college already, man.
JACK
Wow, that's great.
PHIL
I'm proud of him. My little guy
is not so little anymore.
JACK
(moving on)
I don't wanna go home.
PHIL
Wish I could find you a spot.
Sorry, Jack, I don't know this
area.
JACK
Why don't you make a right here.
INT. JACK’S SUV (MOVING) - LATER
He looks out the window... He sees a BLUE NEON SIGN with
some people standing out front...
JACK
Here we go. That looks like a
fucking bar.
As Phil slows, Jack starts to get out -JACK
What's that say? ‘Bleu Bleu.’
Here, let me just try this.
Jack gets out and slams the door behind him.

EXT./INT. “THE BLEU BLEU” - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
As Jack makes his way inside. It’s dark, his eyes
adjusting when... Ramon, the host, comes over to him -RAMON
Oh, shit! Wait, wait. My man...
Aren't you that... Aren't you,
like...
JACK
This is a bar, right?
Ramon looks around.
RAMON
Yeah, but I don't know if this is
your kind of place.
JACK
They got alcohol?
RAMON
(stammers)
Well, yeah, but...
JACK
All right, it's my kind of place.
FOLLOW JACK DEEPER INSIDE.
RAMON
Oh, shit! This is crazy!

How are

JACK
How am I doing? I'm doing all
right if I get a fucking drink.
Someone onstage lip-syncing Etta James’ “At Last.” The
place is packed... And as he settles into the bar, Ramon
gestures toward the PERSON NEXT TO JACK.
RAMON
Oh, this, this my homegirl,
Giselle de la Isma.
JACK
Hey, how you doing?

Hey.

RAMON
That's Jackson Maine.
(to the bartender)
Excuse me, papo! Can we get this
man anything he wants, please?

CONTINUED:

JACK
Can I get a gin on the rocks with
a twist, please?
Jack looks around...
RAMON
Papo, wow. Oh, my gosh. I'm,
like, freaking out right now.
He’s taking in the clientele, starting to notice -JACK
Hey, is this a drag bar?
RAMON
Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah. But,
look, we do this every Friday
night. It's crazy. It's so lit,
though, like -His drink arrives.

He downs it.

JACK
(laughing)
I thought maybe I was in some sort
of hallucinogenic state.
RAMON
No, no. All are welcome.

All are

You gonna have something?

INT. "THE BLEU BLEU" - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON an eyelash being put on. Hair slicked back
through a THREE-FOLD MIRROR cascading light from hot
bulbs in a small, crowded dressing room as MEN IN DRAG
(EMERALD, SOOKI, DONTE) and a few others dress, talk, and
prance about.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
You better get out there and kill
'em tonight.
We can’t quite make out who is at the mirror, only seeing
pieces of SOMEONE.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
All you ladies kill it tonight,
okay?
(CONTINUED)

8.
CONTINUED:

EMERALD
I’m ready.

SOOKI
I always do!

They talk shit to each other -- a little chaotic, but
it’s very familial and warm. They’re all made up as
various famous women...
DRAG BAR EMCEE
Ladies, make sure you turned in
your music already. Don't make me
have to come get you tonight.
This is a professional show.
Emerald slaps on some fake breasts.
BACK AT THE BAR
Jack is nursing another gin chatting with a drag queen,
NICKI. Ramon is surprised to see him.
You stayed!
good?

RAMON
Everything good?

You

JACK
Yeah, I'm just talking to Nicki.
You know Nicki?
Oh, Nicki.

RAMON
How you doing, baby?

JACK
Telling me her life story.
Fascinating.
RAMON
Yo. My home girl's about to
perform.
DRAG BAR EMCEE (O.S.)
(over speaker)
And y'all know her very well,
because she used to work here as a
server. But tonight, the only
thing she's serving are some
fabulous, French live vocals.
BACKSTAGE
We see a SILHOUETTE go down a short hallway, FOLLOWING
her all the way UP the side of the stage and INTO the
wings, waiting to go on, and now lit from the curtains...
It’s ALLY.

9.

BACK AT THE BAR
JACK
Is she really singing, though, or
is it one of those karaoke things?
RAMON
No, no, no. She's really singing,
papo. I promise you, she's really
singing.
JACK
Okay.
Watch this.

RAMON
Watch.

BACK AT STAGE
Ally takes a breath and goes over to the microphone...
and simply begins to sing Edith Piaf’s most famous song,
"La Vie En Rose” in French... In her voice an echo of the
brokenhearted woman’s life is a revelation...
ALLY
(singing in French)
‘Des yeux qui font baisser les
miens,
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche,
Voilà le portrait sans retouches,
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens...
And although her performance is demure in nature, she is
remarkable, her voice so exceptional, talent so
transcendent, Jack can’t help but just stop and listen -Ally sings as she wanders through the audience. She
crawls onto the bar, effortlessly lays back among the
half-made cocktails and spirits.
ALLY
Would anybody like some French
tips tonight?
She gets up onto the bar and begins walking toward
Ramon... her performance, all done to a measured
perfection minus one tiny moment where her eyes pivot and
clock Jack standing there -- only to regroup and continue
with the song.
She lies back, seductively caressing herself with a rose
and giving it to Ramon --

(CONTINUED)

10.
CONTINUED:

She locks eyes with Jack, completely engrossed by her.
Then -Ally makes her way back to the stage as the song comes to
a close. She sings the last impressive note... The
LIGHTS GO OUT as the crowd hoots and hollers.
Yes, baby!

RAMON
Yes, baby!
JACK

Oh, fuck.
RAMON
Papo, are you crying?
JACK
Ah... no.
RAMON
Yo, you have to meet her.
JACK
No, no, I can't meet her.
RAMON
Yes!

Come on.

INT. "THE BLEU BLEU" - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
ALLY at her mirror, already taking off her makeup, is
surrounded by drag queens.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
Miss Ally mama, now you done sang
in French tonight. You gonna pick
something else next week?
ALLY
I don’t know.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
Look at her, she’s doing languages

Ooh, do Moroccan.

JACK

Hi.
ALLY
I thought that might be you.
JACK

What'd you say?
ALLY
I thought that might be you.
JACK
That’s me.
Queens come in and out of the room, slipping past him,
turning back to Ally, giving looks...
DRAG BAR EMCEE (O.S.)
Straight man in the dressing room.
EMERALD
(to Jack)
Do you wanna sit down?
JACK
You can -- You've been on your
feet all night.
No, no.

EMERALD
You're our guest.

He sits down next to Ally.

ALLY
What are you dong here?
JACK
I'm here watching the show,
watching you guys.
EMERALD
Will you sign my boobs?
JACK
(unfazed)
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
ALLY
Uh-oh.

RAMON
Oh, my God!

EMERALD
(to anyone)
Give me a Sharpie!
ALLY
You know, it's BYOB around here.
JACK
Yeah, is that right?
ALLY
(laughs)
Bring your own boobs.
JACK
Oh, those aren't really her boobs?
Looking around, taking it all in.
ALLY
So why are you in here, huh?
JACK
(leaning in)
Sorry?
ALLY
What brings you here?
JACK
Oh, I was playing right around
here tonight. I'm a musician.
ALLY
How'd your show go?
JACK
I think it went all right.

Emerald returns with a Sharpie in hand.
JACK
Okay, here we go. All right.
EMERALD
(handing it to him)
Thank you!
JACK
Which one should I do?
Do 'em both!

EMERALD
I don't care!
ALLY

Slut.
EMERALD
(to Ally)
Bitch, Jackson Maine!
JACK
I’ll just...
Jackson autographs Emerald’s fake boobs -- “JACKSON.”
DRAG BAR EMCEE
She will stop at nothing.
EMERALD
You gotta blow on it!
DRAG BAR EMCEE
(to everyone)
Thank you so much! You don't
gotta go home, but you know the
phrase: You gotta get the hell up
outta here! 'Cause tonight, I'm
not losing my virginity or my
liquor license over you bitches,
so pack up!
ALLY
That’s right!
DRAG BAR EMCEE
(to Ally)
Goodbye, Roger. Have fun.
Ally shares a conspiratorial look with the Emcee as she
leaves -JACK
Do you do that often?
(CONTINUED)

14.
CONTINUED:

ALLY
Do what?
JACK
The show.
ALLY
Yeah, yeah, the girls are so nice
to me here. I mean, they would
never normally let a girl sing at
one of these shows, but they've
always loved my voice. They used
to beg me to sing. It's an honor,
really. I get to be one of the
gay girls.
JACK
Is that your real eyebrow?
ALLY
Um, no. No. I -(laughs)
I make it out of tape.
JACK
Oh, so it's, like, stuck on?
ALLY
Mm-hmm.
JACK
Can I try to take it off?
ALLY
Uh, yeah, sure.
JACK
It's incredible what they do.
Jack ever so gently pulls the tape eyebrow off.
JACK
(the tape)
Look at that.

Oh.

ALLY
(laughs)
Yep. There it is.

JACK
I should put her down somewhere.
Ally holds her hand over her eyebrow.

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED:

JACK
There we go.
(then; noticing)
Why you covering your eye?
ALLY
Oh. Just 'cause I don't have my
eyebrow on anymore.
JACK
Oh, no, no. The whole point is so
I can see your face.
Somehow Jack has grabbed Ally’s hand.
JACK
Yeah, there we go.
She hesitates, but then she looks up... their eyes meet.
It’s altogether unexpected and exhilarating.
ALLY
Why did you come back here?
JACK
Your friend brought me back here.
But I'm glad he did. Can I buy
you a drink?
ALLY
(flustered)
Oh, uh, I gotta change, and I -I've got paint in my hair and my
eyebrows are...
JACK
Oh, that's not your real hair?
ALLY
No, no, my hair is, like, your
color, but um... I paint it with
this... makeup.
JACK
Oh, okay. I'd love to see what
that looks like. I'll wait for
you.
ALLY
Um, yeah, okay. Sure. Yeah, if
you wanna wait, I'll come have a
drink with you. Sure.

REVEAL Emerald on stage, taking her guitar from its
stand.
EMERALD
Don't talk to me like that in that
bus driver wig, girl.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
Oh, I know you did not. What you
have is street appointments

Jack is sitting there laughing.
EMERALD
Excuse me! Mr. Jackson Maine,
would you mind?
JACK
What do you want me to do?
EMERALD
Just come play a little song for
me.
JACK
I don’t know.
DRAG BAR EMCEE
Can you leave the man alone,

EMERALD
I showed you mine, you show me
yours. Come on.
DRAG BAR EMCEE

EMERALD
I don't care, just look at me
while you do it.
Oh, Lord!

DRAG BAR EMCEE
Somebody kill me now.

He begins to pluck the strings, something utterly
different from that assault of “Black Eyes” -JACK

‘Maybe it's time to let the old
ways die,
Maybe it's time to let the old
ways die,
It takes a lot to change a man,
Hell, it takes a lot to try,

lights, in the flesh and blood, feet away in a private
concert for three.

Nobody knows what waits for the
dead,
I'm glad I can't go back to where
I came from,
I'm glad those days are gone, gone
for good,
But if I could take spirits from
my past and bring them here,
you know I would,
Know I would.’
Then he notices her. And sadly for everyone else, the
song comes to an abrupt end -JACK
You ready?
She nods.
EMERALD
Hmm, you know I would!

Can I ask you a personal question?
ALLY
Sure.
JACK
Do you write songs or anything?
ALLY
I don't sing my own songs.
The bartender drops off another drink of Jack.
JACK
(to bartender)
Thank you.
(to Ally)
Why?
ALLY
I just, I just don't feel
comfortable.
JACK
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?
ALLY
Um... Well, 'cause, like, almost
every single person that I've come
in contact with in the music
industry has told me that my nose
is too big and that I won't make
it.
JACK
Your nose is too big?
ALLY
Yeah.
JACK
Your nose is beautiful.
Jack looks at her, dumbfounded. She turns her head
profile, takes her finger and runs it down from her
forehead, over her nose, down to her chin.
JACK
Are you showing me your nose right
now?
She embarrassingly smiles.

(CONTINUED)

20.
CONTINUED:

ALLY
Yeah.
JACK
You don't have to show it to me.
I've been looking at it all night.
ALLY
Oh, come on.
JACK
Oh, I'm gonna be thinking
about your nose for a very
long time.

ALLY
No, you're not. You're
full of shit.

JACK
I'm not full of shit.
ALLY
Yeah, you are.
JACK
I'm telling you the truth.
ALLY
Yeah, you're full of shit.
JACK
Can I touch your nose?
ALLY
Oh, my gosh.
JACK
Let me just touch it for a second.
She laughs, but he’s serious. He reaches in, she lets
him. His finger brushes the top of her nose, intimate,
surreal.
JACK
You're very lucky.
ALLY
Oh, really?
(he nods)
Yeah, not really. My nose has not
made me lucky.
(beat)
I could've had, maybe, a hit song
if it wasn't for my nose.
JACK
That's fucking bullshit.
(CONTINUED)

21.
CONTINUED:

ALLY
Yeah. No, it's not bullshit,
because, you go into these rooms
and there’s all these fucking men
in there and they’re just staring
at you, listening to your record
going, ‘Oh, you sound great, but,
you know, you don’t look so
great.’
JACK
You know, I had a thing when I was
little. I was born with this
thing in my ear. Couldn’t hear...
What do I wind up being? A
singer. So you never know...
(then)
Look... Talent comes everywhere,
everybody’s talented. I bet you,
fucking everybody in this bar is
talented in one thing or another,
but having something to say, and a
way to say it so people listen to
it, that’s a whole other bag. And
unless you get out there and
you try to do it you’ll never
know. That’s just the truth. If
there’s one reason we’re supposed
to be here, it’s to say something
so people wanna hear it.
She’s looking at him.
JACK
Don't you understand what I'm
trying to tell you?
ALLY
Yeah, I do... I don't like it.
But I understand it.
They share a smile.
JACK
Oh, I think you like it a little
bit. I think I'm getting through
a little bit, I can see it.
ALLY
No, you can't.
JACK
It's a good thing we met...

JACK
That's the thing about when you
get famous, people start saying
your full name.
ALLY
Well, what do you want me to -JACK
Well, it’s just ‘Jack.’
The jukebox has started to play a song of Jack’s: “Too

Right.

Okay.

“I’m so sorry...”
TOMMY
Who looks just like you, that’s

Dave, take a picture...

Ally gets up, maybe to intervene.
JACK

Well, maybe that'll help her out.
(back to Tommy)
Will that help you? Would that
make you happy?
Tommy gets into Jack’s space, stumbling into him to pose
for the picture...
JACK
Okay, why don’t we take the
fucking picture.
TOMMY
Let her visualize it.
ALLY
You want someone to take your
picture?
Ally steps up to him.
TOMMY

Excuse me.
ALLY
I’ll help you take a picture.
Ally pulls his hand away and, in doing so, he gets rough
with her.
TOMMY
Get your hand off me, you fucking
little whore!
ALLY
What?!
Ally punches him in the face... sending him back into the
crowded bar. Everyone in the vicinity takes note...
Things get out of control for a second -I got you.

It’s alright...

Jack grabs her, pulling her out of the room and laughing

Fluorescent lighting... Jack walking up and down the
aisles, looking for something -- Ally trying to keep
up...
ALLY
I'm fine, honestly.
This is so stupid.

I'm okay.

JACK
You gotta get ahead of the
swelling. Just try to find
some...
ALLY
This is so embarrassing.
Jack pulls a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and puts
it on her hand.
JACK
Here we go. Put that on there.
Gotta wrap something up with it.
Find a...
Jack grabs a bag of Cheetos.
ALLY
You like Cheetos?
JACK
No, like, gauze. Some gauze or
something.
ALLY
Gauze?
Jack stops to look at her hand to see if it’s starting to
swell. He holds it, looking at it with her...
JACK
(flexing his hand)
Try to do that.
She tries, but can’t really.
JACK
With that hand. And do that hand.
You play piano?
(as she nods)
Yeah, we gotta take care of this,
then.
He walks away.

INT. SUPER A FOODS - CHECK-OUT COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER
The CASHIER is swiping their items.
JACK
It's already gotten warm, hasn't
it? Should we have gotten two?
No, it's okay.

ALLY
Thanks.

CLICK.
The Cashier is holding up her phone and just took a
picture, Ally not quite in frame...
I'm sorry.

FEMALE CASHIER
I had to.

JACK
That's all right. Have a good
one.
ALLY
It's not really all right, but...
And as they stumble out -JACK
Be careful, she'll hit ya.
EXT. SUPER A FOODS - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Jack’s SUV parked, Phil, the driver eating the Cheetos
off a ways, Jack and Ally sitting outside the store sideby-side on a parking block.
JACK
These rings are gonna get stuck if
you don't take 'em off... Does
that hurt?
Yeah.

ALLY
That's okay...

JACK
(holding her hand)
May I?
ALLY
Yeah.
Jack sucks on her finger, wetting it and slipping the
rings off, places them in his pocket.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Safe keeping.
Jack reaches for the frozen peas.
JACK
Put this on there.
ALLY
You’re sweet.
JACK
Just wrap it up... You'll be good
to go.
He puts it on her hand and WRAPS IT with GAUZE and TAPE.
ALLY
How the hell do you deal with that
all the time?
JACK
What's that?
ALLY
People just talking to you like
you're not a real person. Or
taking your picture -JACK
Is that too tight?
ALLY
It's okay.
He tears the wrap with his teeth -JACK
Did I hurt you?
ALLY
It’s fine, it's okay.
He finishes wrapping the package of peas to her hand.
JACK
There you go, now you're mobile.
Swing it around.
They start to laugh.

It looks ridiculous.

ALLY
I look like a pirate.

JACK
I told you it was worth coming
here.
A beat...
ALLY
How do you do that?
JACK
Do what?
ALLY
Don't change the subject.
JACK
Is that what I'm doing?
ALLY
Nobody ever asked you about you,
huh?
JACK
Not sure.
ALLY
Where you from?
JACK
Arizona.
ALLY
Arizona boy.
JACK
Dad had like a midlife crisis, I
think, so I've been told. Made
his way to Arizona, started
working for this family on a pecan
ranch.
ALLY
A pecan ranch...
JACK
Yeah... Knocked up the family's
daughter, she was just shy of
eighteen.
ALLY
Uh-oh.
JACK
That's when I came into the
picture.

CONTINUED:

ALLY
Okay, the son of an eighteen-yearold.
JACK
Well, she died at childbirth.
my dad --

And

ALLY
I’m sorry.
JACK
He died when I was thirteen, so, I
guess my brother will tell you
that he raised me, but I don't
know... I don't know who was
raising who. Just a hundredtwenty-seven acres of nuts,
Navajo, and nowhere to go.
She looks at him, he’s gone inside himself a bit, looking
down, doesn’t usually share this much -ALLY
(singing)
‘Tell me something boy,
Aren’t you tired tryin’ to fill
that void?
Or do you need more,
Ain’t it hard keepin’ it so
hardcore?’
A beat...
JACK
Is that me?
ALLY
That’s you.
JACK
You just write that now?
ALLY
Yeah.
JACK
It's pretty good.
ALLY
(singing)
‘I’m falling,
In all the good times,
I find myself longing for change.’
(CONTINUED)

30.
CONTINUED:

She starts to get up.
ALLY
I started writing this song the
other day, and...
She gets up off the curb and into the parking lot, her
very own stage...
ALLY
Maybe that could work, like, as a
chorus or something. I have to
think if I can remember it.
(singing)
‘I’m off the deep end,
Watch as I dive in,
I’ll never meet the ground,
Crash through the surface,
Where they can’t hurt us,
We’re far from the shallow now.’
JACK
Holy shit.
She starts to laugh, noticing her pea-wrapped hand.
ALLY
(laughing)
What is this? Was this supposed
to help me?
She sits back down next to him.

He leans into her.

JACK
Can I tell you a secret?
Closer now, and whispering -JACK
I think you might be a songwriter.
She downcasts her eyes away from him.
JACK
But don't worry, I won't tell
anybody. But I'm not very good at
keeping secrets.
He kisses her hand.
ALLY
You're a real gentleman.
(beat; then)
I think.

She places her hand on his cheek and they sit there,
holding in this moment, not wanting the night to end.
EXT. ALLY’S HOUSE (THE VALLEY) - EARLY MORNING
Jack’s SUV pulling up in front of a house with three
identical BLACK SUVs parked along the curb -ALLY (V.O.)
Thank you, sir. It's right here,
on the right.
INT./EXT. THE SUV (PARKED)/ALLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
It’s the time Ally should probably get out of the car and
yet, she and Jack sit there quietly together. They don’t
want to leave each other, the night still running through
their veins -JACK
(re: SUVs)
What’s all this?
It’s my dad.

ALLY
It’s a long story.

JACK
What's he, a sheikh?
ALLY
No, he's a driver.
JACK
Hey, I got a gig. You wanna come?
ALLY
When?
PHIL
We're headed to the airport now.
JACK
Well, it's tonight.
She looks up at the sky, the sun has come up...
ALLY
Tonight? No, I can't. I gotta go
to work later. I gotta go to bed.
She begins gathering her things.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Who's gonna take care of your
hand? I messed it up.
Me.

ALLY
I'll take care of my hand.

JACK
It's my fault I took you to that
place.
She opens the SUV door and slides out.
That’s okay.
Okay.

ALLY
You have my number.

JACK
All right.

She shuts the door and starts to walk off... Jack lowers
the window.
JACK
Hey.
Ally turns back.
ALLY
What?
JACK
I just wanted to take another look
at you.
Ally slides her finger down her nose just the way Jack
did at the cop bar. She walks inside. The SUV drives
off.
JACK
(sotto)
I don't know, maybe I fucked that
up.
INT. ALLY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ally walks up the stairs and a distinctive, manicured,
fastidious-looking man in his early sixties, wearing a
black suit and a black tie: LORENZO CAMPANA, meets her
on the landing.
LORENZO
Pretty late... pretty late.

ALLY
Oh, is it late?
LORENZO
Come on.

I wanna go to bed.
LORENZO
No, come in for two minutes. The

come on...
(as she considers)
Two minutes...
ALLY
Okay.

Wolfie!
Ally moves past him towards the kitchen.
WOLFIE (O.S.)
Yeah, sweetheart?
LORENZO
Who was the guy in the car?
ALLY
I don't know what you're talking
about.
And as they pass the dining room we see racing forms
cluttering the table; MATTY, an older driver watching a
live broadcast of a racetrack from Japan where the horses
are approaching the starting gate. The announcer
speaking rapid Japanese.
MATTY
Hey, Ally.
Ally moves into the kitchen where a waiting WOLFIE stands
reading a racing form.
ALLY

How's it going? Happy birthday.
WOLFIE
Hey, ‘happy birthday’?
ALLY
Yeah.

Ally immediately begins cleaning.
ALLY
Who the hell's betting on horses

WOLFIE
It's not breakfast time in Japan.
Wolfie laughs... A toilet flushes O.S. and LITTLE FEET
has appeared to the group.
MATTY
They're loading!
LITTLE FEET
Renzo, we're going. Come on!
WOLFIE
It'll wait, they're loading -And we see the horses loading into the starting gate as
the men assemble around the dining room table to watch
the race, clearly a ritual.

You guys are crazy.
WOLFIE
Have a sizable investment on this
thing here.

singers that make it. You know?
Ally’s not hearing this speech again and so heads back
into the kitchen. Lorenzo continues to hold court at the
dining room table.
LORENZO
I knew a couple guys, could sing
Sinatra under the table. But
Frank, he'd come on stage with the
blue eyes, the sharkskin suit, the
patent leather shoes. He becomes
Frank Sinatra. And everybody
else, all these other guys, that
really got it, that really have it

nobodies.
Ally listens until she’s had enough.

Okay. Everybody, let's go.

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Jack has a pair of headphones on. We hear a high-pitched
noise. He holds up one finger. He takes off the
headphones, revealing a HEARING DOCTOR.
HEARING DOCTOR
Unfortunately, you keep blasting
the hearing, it's not gonna come
back. I think it's time we
reconsider the inner monitors.
JACK
Mm-hmm.

We talked about that with Bobby a
couple of weeks ago.
Yup, yup.

Yeah.

Yeah, okay, that sounds great.

You're not gonna get back what you

JACK
Oh, wow. I think we're managing
pretty good.

What do you want me to do?
Jack speaks into the mic, his voice echoing through the

Yo, so you fucking hit a cop?
ALLY
Yeah, he was being an asshole to

the face.
RAMON
Yo, that is so gangster.
ALLY
And so, then we ended up in a
parking lot, and he put peas
around my hand to fix it. And
then he was singing, and I was
singing. I don't know what the

EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - TARMAC - SUNDOWN

Ally and Ramon get out of the car, Ramon pirouetting his
way onto the plane -- the music still going...

his phone, recording this once in a lifetime experience.

The music growing louder with every step... She looks
back to Ramon to pick up the pace and then he’s there,
taking up her arm and walking in stride, getting closer
and closer...
GAIL
Guys, this way.

GAIL
He's excited that you're here.
They walk around a wall of amps and through PEOPLE onto
SIDE STAGE LEFT, where we FIND Jack, drenched with sweat,
playing along with his band in the middle of the stage in
front of thousands. She squeezes Ramon’s arm... She
can't help but be taken by the overwhelming power of the
whole thing...

guitar solo, into the chorus refrain that he belts out
with two other players...
Ally watches his every move, time seems to slow down for
her, out of body, wanting to experience each and every
moment... it’s all second nature to Jack... And as the
song ends...
JACK
(into mic)
Thank you very much. That was
great... There's a friend of mine,
who came a long way to be here...
She wrote a great song, and I'd
just like her to sing it. I think
it's pretty fucking good.
The audience cheers. He motions her on the stage... and
now she is hit with severe self-consciousness, she
doesn't want that... she starts to walk off... Jack
bounds over to her, taking her hand...
How are you?

JACK
You made it!
ALLY

I'm good.

Hi!

JACK
It's so good to see you.

ALLY
How are you? That was so

She frees her hand... starting to walk off into the
shadows to hide...

stage)
That's all you gotta do. I'm
gonna sing it either way, so...
ALLY

‘Trust me.’ Okay.
RAMON
You have to go sing.
ALLY
I'm not going out there, no.
Jack starts to play a familiar melody reminding us of the
song she came up with the night before. He starts to
sing the first verse -JACK
(into mic; singing)
‘Tell me somethin’, girl,
Are you happy in this modern
world?,
Or do you need more,
Is there somethin’ else you're
searchin’ for?,’
In fact, that is exactly what it is, “SHALLOW.”

belts out the chorus.

ALLY
Jack?
She looks around for Jack for respite... but she’s lost
him. An unexpected moment of panic washing over her...
When -JACK

Hey, hey, hey. You all right?
VARIOUS CROWD MEMBERS
Jackson!/Good concert, man!/Isn't
that the girl who sang? Good
concert!
JACK
Thank you, yeah.

CROWD MEMBER
Jackson, I love you, man.

Thank

And as they are about the board the bus, Bobby is there.
Hey, Jack.

BOBBY
Killed it.
JACK

Really?
BOBBY
Yeah.
And during this moment between them, Ally feels the eyes
of a young MAN, confident beyond his years. We’ll come
to know him as REZ.
Jack pulls Ally into his trailer where a big crowd is
partying. Jack puts his cowboy hat on her head where she
receives an encore from Jack’s band.
INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - LATER
Jack stumbles down the long corridor of the hotel with
Ally in tow. A little loaded, he searches for the key,
but in which pocket? He finds it and they enter the
room.
INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT
They barge in; he turns and kisses her. Ecstatic, if not
sloppy... and as they catch their breath with the hint of
something more to come...

She pulls away as Jack stumbles, a toxic rush of blood to
the head.
ALLY
(sotto voce)
Where's the fucking bathroom?
She finds it and goes into the bathroom.
Jack makes his way to the couch, lights a cigarette, and
lies down.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Ally looks into the mirror. Jesus. What is happening
right now. Ally wets a towel, gives it the ol’ once-over
and lets out a breath and goes back into -INT. HOTEL - ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
She turns the corner in eager anticipation only to find
Jack passed out.
ALLY
Hey, Jack?
JUMP CUT TO:
RAMON’S ROOM
Ramon is shirtless at his hotel room door, music,
laughter from within which he’s inclined to return to -RAMON
I don't know, wake him up.
ALLY
I can't wake him up.

He's drunk.

RAMON
Yes, you can! Shake your titties
in his face or some shit... You
know what I'm saying? Take two
shots and --

ALLY
(sarcastic)
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.
RAMON
Let me know how it goes, baby.
She walks off.
INT. HOTEL - ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Ally returns to where Jack was but -- Bobby is putting
Jack into bed.
BOBBY
(to Jack)
C’mon, pal.
And, used to it, Bobby perfunctorily puts a pillow under
his head. Ally watches Bobby handle Jack with a
surprising tenderness -- He looks at her...
BOBBY
He’s out.
(then; laughing at
her willful naiveté)
You think maybe he drinks a bit
much? Sweetie, you have no idea.
He starts to walk off, but turns to her -BOBBY
Tell you one thing, though. He's
never brought a girl onstage
before.
(beat)
And it's been a long, long time
since he played like that.
ALLY
Well, that's good to know.
And leaving her all alone, Ally sits on the edge of the
bed, while Jack sleeps. Watching him sleep, alone with
her moment of glory.
She starts to hum the melody to “Somewhere Over the
Rainbow” ever so lightly as she undresses and climbs
under the covers with him, looking small... The two of
them quite a pair...

52.

INT. HOTEL - THEIR ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Ally under the covers, asleep beside Jack. His eyes
open. He comes awake, finding his bearings. He sees her
next to him asleep. He looks at her back.
He moves closer, tenderly kissing her shoulders. She
murmurs, coming awake. He kisses her neck. She rolls
over. He kisses her face. Her lips.
She pulls him closer as they make love in the witching
hour... what feels like a real love...
INT. HOTEL - THEIR ROOM - LATER
Jack in his shirt and underwear and Ally in a hotel robe
sitting around the dining table, eating breakfast.
JACK
One time, my brother came home...
I was playing on this upright we
used to always have in our den.
And I was, like, in my own world.
And no one was ever home, and he
comes home to take care of my dad,
who was sick. And he's sitting
there, and he's looking at me.
And I swear to God, he looked at
me like I was special or
something, and it just kind of
filled me up, and... I should've

WOLFIE
Get the fuck outta here. How do
they know how many people looked
at it?
LITTLE FEET
They call it an algorithm...
WOLFIE

He points to the growing number on the screen.
WOLFIE

LORENZO
That's how many people have

WOLFIE
Yeah, yeah, we...

We were telling him.

WOLFIE
How the fuck do they do that?
LORENZO
I watched it two hundred times

Jack races Ally back to the bed, but he grabs her,
carries her into the bedroom; they crash among the sheets
and blankets.

OUTSIDE ALLY’S BATHROOM
Jack waits while Ally showers. She comes out and sees
the motorcycle helmets in his hands. She spies his
motorcycle parked outside.

I haven't even thought about
drinking or anything else.

We'll see how long that lasts.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Lorenzo talks Jack’s ear off.
LORENZO
Actually, when I was, like, in my

fact, a lot of people thought I
was better than Sinatra.
WOLFIE
Jesus.
Frank?

JACK
Frank Sinatra?

All Lorenzo’s buddies explode with laughter.

Ally rides on the back of Jack’s motorcycle as they cross
the state line into Arizona.

Ally scribbles down some notes.

ALLY
That's my songbook. I usually use
a typewriter, but... I had this
idea on the bike, and I didn't
wanna forget it.
JACK
How do you hear it?
She mimics playing the piano, singing the percussive
beats to a song still emerging.
ALLY
(singing)
‘I’m alone in my house.’
She pours herself a glass of water and, keeping the
conversation going -ALLY
Aren't you excited to be home and
play for all your Arizonian fans?
JACK
I don't really come back here.

You avoid your home?

IT’S A VAST WIND FARM, stretching into the distance...
Jack standing, looks around... Ally in the distance looks
around as well...
ALLY
Jack?
Then to Jack... It’s as if all the life has been sucked
out of him. He tries to speak, but the words don’t
come... He bends down and sifts some dry sand through his
fingers.
EXT./INT. COUNTY FAIR/BACKSTAGE - DAY
Bobby is going over a SET LIST with a TECH.
BOBBY
Whenever he shows up. These guys
have been vamping out there for a

He looks up to see Jack -BOBBY
Don't you get tired of being...
BAM!
Jack DECKS Bobby with a hard punch sending him flat to
the ground -JACK

it into a fucking wind farm!
Bobby’s trying to get his bearings, but he’s dazed...

I bought that for you.

Where's his grave?
BOBBY
(exploding)
He washed away in a fucking storm.
His grave isn't there anymore. I
would have told you, but you were
fucking drunk. You were fucking
loaded and already pissing
yourself a swan song. Fuck if you
shed a tear for that piece of shit
you idolize for no goddamn fucking
reason. All Dad ever did for
you... is make you his fucking
drinking buddy. And you'd be
right there with him if he was
still alive, and you fucking know
it.
Ally looks at Jack, his head down, thinking god knows
what... But Bobby grabs Jack’s face, pulling him close,
nose-to-nose, nowhere to hide.
BOBBY
What did you think, that I was
gonna fucking take care of it
while I'm fucking cradling your
ass all over the goddamn world?
JACK
That's a good excuse. Raising a
little brother, so you don't have
to deal with the fact that you
were no fucking good.
BOBBY
If I was no good, why'd you steal
my fucking voice?
JACK
'Cause you had nothing to fucking
say. And you were too proud to

Erupting applause from the AUDIENCE. The music kicks in,

Ally plays the piano.

I came from,
I'm glad those days are gone, gone

But if I could take spirits from
my past and bring them here,

Know I would.’
And as their unheard performance comes to a close, Jack’s
song and words fade into the diegetic sounds of a crowd
wanting more, not wanting the concert to end, the shout
and chant which beckons an encore -They continue -END MONTAGE.

euphoria of performing still coursing through their veins

Ally pours herself another shot of tequila and gulps it
down.
There’s big applause.

Ally walks --

badly wants and what is stopping her... She looks at
Jack, who smiles his encouragement, making her feel safe,

Ally looks out at the audience... Here she goes, into the
abyss...

Burnin’ in your eyes,
You look at me and, babe, I wanna

makes the night stand still... the world at her feet...

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - DAY
Musical instruments, a microphone, recording equipment...
Jack on the sofa, hears the door open, then a chiming
sound... A LITTLE AUSTRALIAN LABRADOODLE PUPPY comes
running up to him, all love.
Hey, you?

JACK
Who are you?

Ally comes in, holding a leash, dog food by her side.
ALLY
Thought we could use some
company...
Jack looks at the new dog tag:

CHARLIE.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Ally straddles Jack in the bathtub. She puts MASCARA on
his eyelashes, he’s playfully resistant.
JACK
This has never been done before,
just so you know.
She ever so gently places a BLACK TAPE EYEBROW on his
face.

It actually has been done before.

ALLY
What are you talking about?
JACK
I have to do some soul-crushing
work there... But it keeps the
lights on and then some. So I
should be grateful, but it's just
kind of... never what I thought
I'd wind up doing.
Vulnerable to say the least.
JACK
I've made peace with it, though.
Anyway, if you wanna come, I
thought we'd have a laugh, at the
very least.
ALLY

Rez wants to keep me here because
they rushed out the single...
They were so excited that they
want me to finish the album. So
I'm working on that.

start to file into the chairs...

Jack takes out a pill bottle... he takes his boot and
smashes the pills and snorts them off the table... He
puts the remainder of the crushed pills in a glass and
chases it with a big swig of gin.
ON STAGE
The band is playing, but Jack’s not there. Everyone is
waiting for him. Then, finally, Jack, a gin on the rocks
in his hand, obviously two sheets to the wind, coming out
to join his band to large applause. Jack looking out at
the audience, a sea of name tags... He puts on his
guitar.
JACK
Oh, fuck.

Jack, you okay? Jack?
And as he plays, drunk, loaded, but good enough to be
passable and keep on his feet...

You've just been nominated for
three Grammys. Including ‘Best
New Artist.’ They just announced
it now.
She looks at him like he's crazy.
REZ

Everybody, Grammy-nominated
artist.
Ally's stunned. She sits there, gathering herself, and
the whole crew starts to CLAP for her and approach her to
congratulate her... Rez hugs her.
REZ
Congrats.
INT. JACK'S HOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - MORNING
And we see Jack, a drink in his hand, sitting on the
floor... He gets up as he sees Ally approaching.
ALLY
Have you been drinking?

Ally snatches the glass out of his hand, smells the
gin... A loaded moment between them.
JACK
I've had a couple.
ALLY
It's the morning.
He looks out the window.
JACK
Yup.
She walks out, leaving him... Charlie the dog nuzzles

JACK
Hey, buddy.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
Ally is now in the bath, a moment of respite, quietly

Thank you.

ALLY
How did you find that

JACK
Bobby told me. He called, he said
that they want me to do some Roy
Orbison tribute, some super group
thing, but...
ALLY
That’s great.
JACK
But the point is you got nominated
and it’s great. I’m just trying
to figure it out, that’s all.
ALLY
What are you trying to
figure out?

JACK
‘Why you come around with
an ass like that?’

She looks at him dumbfounded...
ALLY
What are you... You singing my

JACK
‘Why you look so good in those

ALLY
Yeah, that’s my song.

You’re worried that you’re ugly -and you’re not, I’m trying to tell

That hurts.

Yeah, I have a boyfriend.

You’re my boyfriend! You’re my

JACK
I don’t even know what that

ALLY
It means clean your shit up.
You’re fucking messy. That’s what

JACK
Well, that's not true.
ALLY
Oh, it isn’t?
He shakes his head.

You want to be my drinking buddy?
Want to practice?

You don’t?

You can’t even concentrate

That’s right.

ALLY

You don’t think I can
handle it. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go,
Jack, want me to be your
dad, be your drinking
buddy? Here we go...

JACK
Yeah, you couldn’t be my dad if
you fucking tried. He had more
talent in his fucking finger than
your whole fucking body, so don’t
even fucking go there about that,
alright? That’s over the fucking
line.
ALLY
Why don’t you have another drink
and we can just get fucking drunk
until we fucking disappear, okay?
Hey... do you got those pills in
your pocket?
JACK
You're just fucking ugly, that's

ALLY
I'm what?
JACK
You're just fucking ugly.

Jack gets up and leaves.

We STAY WITH her.

EXT. CONCERT VENUE - NIGHT
The crowd roars for an encore. We hear the ringing in
Jack’s ear. Then, from out of the darkness, Jack returns
to stage wearing his hat. He takes his guitar and sits
down... looking out into the lights, the faceless
crowd...

He begins to play the guitar, the familiar beginnings of

What’s there to say?

ALLY
I know, but... It got bad when we
were together. It’s okay, I mean,
it’s fine. I just was wondering,

ALLY
I brought something.
She goes into her bag.
ALLY
I wanna know what this is, my
love.
She hands him her songbook. It has a folded piece of
paper inside. He looks at it...
On the paper is scribbled:
“Don’t wanna feel another touch
Don’t wanna start another fire
Don’t wanna know another kiss
No other name fallin' off my lips
Don’t wanna give my heart away
to another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
-- I'll never love again”
Reading it... Remembering it...
ALLY
You hiding love songs?
JACK
I don't know, it sort of fell out
of me, I guess, and onto this
page. And I put it in here, and I
thought... I thought maybe you'd
find it when you, uh... when you
came back to you, maybe.
ALLY
Well, I found it.

JACK
Listen... I’m... I’m sorry.

Rez shakes his head in frustration -ALLY
We’ll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able
to play by himself.

REZ
You realize that's not an
option.

ALLY
He's so inside of his art in a way
he has never been.
REZ

Ally, there is no way that you can
take Jack on tour with you!
There's no way.
ALLY
He can hear himself again.

Do you understand what I'm
saying?

Ally begins to play the piano.

You know what? If you can't make
that happen, then fucking cancel

INT. BOBBY’S TRUCK (MOVING) - MAGIC HOUR
Bobby drives his TRUCK down a dirt road with Jack riding
shotgun. They’ve ridden like this across the country and
back a lot over the years... A lot of hard miles on the
odometer and between brothers... Bobby looks over to him,
then back to the road... Jack just stares out the window,
lost in thought.
BOBBY
I think if we had a better band
name, we might've made it. Or
maybe it was because we looked
like a father and son duo. Not
many of those around.
Jack laughs.

JACK
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.
BOBBY
Not my fault I couldn't find a
better guitar player in the whole
goddamn state.
They share a small laugh... Then, after a beat...
BOBBY
Where in the fuck is it?
JACK
(points)
Right here. Thanks for the ride.
They pull into Jack’s driveway.
BOBBY
Sure thing, Jack.
Jack starts to get out of the truck, but stops short...
JACK
Hey, you know, uh... when I, um...
When I said I would, you know,
when I... took your voice, you
know. It's you I idolized. It
wasn't Dad.
And with that Jack, shuts the door. Bobby takes that
in... then drives off. Jack watching him go.
INT. JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jack walks into the house, taking it all in. Altogether
familiar and somehow foreign, like riding in the backseat
of your own car. Little things are different, the
furniture has been rearranged slightly... A “La Vie En
Rose” neon sign is off...
He goes over to it. Turns it on, realizing this new
addition their home.
Then Charlie runs up to Jack, a “welcome home” bow tied
around his collar...
JACK
Hey, Charlie...

That sounded unbelievable, what

excess water off his body.
INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jack walks to the door in jeans.
INT. JACK’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Rez is standing outside the glass door as he watches Jack
walk up, zipping up his pants.
REZ

Back from the dead.
JACK

Hey, sorry. Were you waiting
long?
Hey, Jack.

REZ
No, no.

JACK
Uh, Ally's not home, uh...

No, I told her I'd meet her here,

Of course, yeah.
Rez hesitates, but then they walk in together.

REZ
Anything for her.
JACK
She told me about that European
leg. That's a hell of an
accomplishment this soon out of
the gate. Shit, I remember it
was, like, uh, ten years before I
ever went across the pond.
REZ
It was summer, two-thousand-four.
JACK
Shit, was it?
Rez sits on the coffee table, gets in Jack’s space, he
wants him to hear this.
REZ
We’re not exactly friends here.
While you've been away, we've been
back here in serious triage,
trying to clean up your fucking
mess. Barely finding our way
through it.
Jack doesn’t even know what to say.
REZ
You almost single-handedly
derailed her whole career. You
understand that? She's never
gonna say this to you. She loves
you too much. Just by staying
married to you, she looks like a
joke. It's embarrassing.
Rez motions to Jack’s drink.
REZ
Let's be honest, we both know it's
only a matter of time before
that's pushed aside again for the

him. He doesn’t say anything, just looks at her with a
warm smile.
Hey.

ALLY
I have some good news.
JACK

Yeah?
ALLY
I'm not gonna go to Europe. We're
gonna cancel the rest of the tour,
and I'm just gonna be here all
summer. Isn't that great?
JACK
What happened?
ALLY
Nothing happened. The label just
loves the record, and it's doing
so well, and they wanna keep with
the momentum and have me make
another one. Rez is super
psyched, so it'll be great.
Jack takes that in...
ALLY

EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - GARAGE - LATER
Jack is in his truck. He sits as it idles, presumably
warming it up. Then, after a beat, he backs out of the
driveway, but then -Stops. Cuts the engine. Sits and waits. We can’t see
what he’s doing, but he shifts around in his seat for a
moment, almost as if pulling something from his pocket...
INSIDE THE PICKUP
Jack fumbles with a bottle of pills in the glove
compartment.

The sound deafening... Ally prays in a circle with her
crew.

And as Ally’s BAND plays out the last few bars, her voice
holds the final note. Long and steady, the audience
exhilarated to see how long she can hold it -- which is
very long.
A beat.

A breath.

The audience on their feet, already wanting an encore...
Eruption of a CROWD going crazy as Ally, breathless,
comes UPSTAGE RIGHT down their staircase into the bowels
below the stage.
Rez is waiting -ALLY
Is he here?
REZ
He's not here.
ALLY
He's not here?
She gulps from a water bottle while the stylists change
her costume, Rez in tow.
REZ

there. Everything's gonna remain
the same, okay?
ALLY
What?
REZ
The guitar's up there.
Everything's gonna remain the

Ally turns and walks back up the stairs and out into the
thrash of people -The audience applause morphing into a chant.
The band plays a familiar intro -- the first few chords
of “Shallow”... The audience catches it, they erupt in
tandem with the band coming in full force -This is a whole new version of Jack and Ally’s song.
This song has evolved much like the performer at center
stage.

Ally plays and sings by herself at a piano on a platform
in the middle of the arena along with Jack’s guitar on

Bobby sits next to Ally, equally broken, feeling the very
same thing, quiet. He doesn’t move, although it feels
like they need to hold each other.

his songs in a bar I was in the
other night... They're playing his
songs everywhere.
He thinks about it...

how can any of these people feel
like they knew him? Who he really

But then something changed. And
it soothed me. That, well, it
wasn't all for fucking nothing.
She looks at him.
ALLY

The last thing I did was lie to
him.
BOBBY
Listen to me. It isn't your
fault. It just isn't. You know
whose fault it was? Jack. That's
it. No one else. Not you, not
me. No one but Jack.
ALLY
(crying)
I just keep going over and over
it, over it in my head.
After some moments...
BOBBY
Jack talked about how music is
essentially twelve notes between
any octave. Twelve notes and the
octave repeats. It's the same
story. Told over and over.
Forever. All any artist can offer
the world is how they see those
twelve notes. That's it.
Ally looks at him, hearing him.

hands clasping each other -- Much in the same way she

proscenium larger than we have ever seen. The lights
find her...

The crowd embraces her, “We love you Ally,” and
encouragement from all over... She puts her head down...
We see she’s a brunette. No makeup.

microphone)
Hello, I'm Ally Maine. Thank you
for being here tonight to honor my
husband.
The crowd adoring her, accepting her at her most
vulnerable...
ALLY

microphone)
He wrote a song for me. I'd like
to sing it for him tonight. And
with your help, maybe I can.
Thank you. Really. Thank you.
And with that, she begins to sing an original song, “I’ll
Never Love Again.” We SLOWLY PUSH IN -- The audience a
distant sound, their encouragement, their belief...
ALLY
(singing)
‘Wish I could,
I could have said goodbye,
I would have said what I wanted
to,
Maybe even cried for you,
If I knew it would be the last

We see GLIMPSES of Ally and Jack in bed with the glow of
the “La Vie En Rose” neon sign. She runs her finger down
his profile, they laugh together.
