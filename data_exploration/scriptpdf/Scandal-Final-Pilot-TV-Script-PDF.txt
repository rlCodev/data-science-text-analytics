INT. BAR - NIGHT

A Washington DC bar. Upscale. Young and intense in that
way that means everyone is holding a martini and scanning
the room for people more important than they are. It's not
drinks, it's a competition. And the winner is HARRISON (late
20s). At least, he ACTS like the winner. Right now, he's
at a table, drink in hand. QUINN (20s) comes in. Quinn
hates the fact that people assume that because she is pretty,
she is not smart. Because she is. Smart.

QUINN

HARRISON

QUINN
I can't stay. I'm sorry. I only
came because Lori wouldn't give me
your number so I could cancel and I
didn't want you to be waiting here

Harrison reels in his fish.
HARRISON
Quinn, this is not a blind date. On
blind dates, I like to buy a woman
dinner because it makes her more
likely to either sleep with me or
give me a second date. When I buy
you dinner, you'll know I'm

HARRISON (CONT'D)
The way I know you applied for a job
with me is that I have your resume
on my iPad. The way I know you would
kill puppies to get this job is that
you stopped breathing when I said
the name Olivia Pope. Which is a
tell, your tell, and you should look
at that because I'm going to offer
you a crap salary and you'll have to
take it because you never learned to
breathe in and out without stopping.
But don't feel bad about it because
we all get paid crap salaries because
we're the good guys. I'm a good guy
which means I don't generally lie
but I did to you. This is not a job
interview.
Wait.

QUINN
I don't...I'm confused.

HARRISON
Olivia already told me to hire you.
The job is yours. If you want it.
It's the best job you'll ever have.
You will change lives, you will slay
dragons, you will love the hunt more
than you ever dreamed. Because Olivia
Pope is as amazing as they say. And
I am not a baby lawyer, I am a
gladiator in a suit. Because that's
what you are when you work for Olivia.
A gladiator in a suit. You wanna be
a gladiator in a suit?
His enthusiasm is mesmerizing.

And true.

Quinn nods.

HARRISON (CONT'D)
You gotta say it.

OLIVIA (30s) rides up. Stylish but weary, too smart for her
own good. People tend to underestimate her. That's a
mistake. Next to her is STEPHEN (30s), he carries a SMALL
BLACK SUITCASE. STEPHEN's handsome and male and brilliant
in a way that makes you worried you'll do something
inappropriate like lick him. Right now, he's very unhappy.
STEPHEN
We're gonna get killed.
OLIVIA
Did you propose? Weren't you going
to ask her tonight?
STEPHEN
I was doing this tonight -- 'Liv,
we're gonna get killed. We're short
three million dollars.
OLIVIA
So you flaked. -- Why are we short?
STEPHEN
The Ambassador couldn't come up with
the rest, which is a problem, it's a
very big problem and why we shouldn't
even be going in there right now -And I did not flake. I'm working.
For you.
OLIVIA
Don't worry, they'll take what we
give them -- did you at least buy
the engagement ring?
STEPHEN
Olivia. Ukranian mobsters do not
'take what you give them,' they just
shoot you. So we have bigger problems
than me not proposing to my
girlfriend. We are in a situation
here. Focus. Do what you do.

Where two men in expensive suits are waiting. They look
like businessmen. Or stockbrokers. Let's call them OSKAR
(40s) and VLAD (50s). They're Russian and scary. There's a
BOX on the table in the corner. Olivia is calm, confident.
OLIVIA
Good evening, gentlemen.
OSKAR
You got the money?
Of course.

OLIVIA
All three million.

She nods to the suitcase Stephen's holding. He holds it up
as if to say 'here it is,' smiles weakly. Oskar and Vlad
glare at Olivia.
We said six.
Did we?
We did.

Olivia moves towards the box on the table. Vlad shifts, and
we suddenly notice he's got a gun resting on his thigh.
Stephen sees it right away, puts out a hand to stop her.
OSKAR
Leave the three. When you come back
with the rest, we have a deal.
OLIVIA
That's not gonna happen, Oskar.
No?

OSKAR

OLIVIA
Nyet. What's going to happen is,
you and Vlad are going to take the
three million and leave right now
for Dulles to make your flight to
the Motherland. The reason you're
going to want to go right now, besides
the fact that it's just good travel
sense to leave yourself enough time
for International check-in, is in
exactly four hours and fifteen
minutes, both of your names are going
to suddenly 'pop up' on Homeland
Security's no-fly list. Lucky for
you, you're booked on a flight that
leaves in two and a half hours. So
if it were me, I'd much rather spend
three million dollars in Kiev than
here in Georgetown, way more bang
for your buck. In fact, it may even
feel like six once you're there.
Olivia smiles sweetly at Oscar, who looks slightly worried.
He exchanges a look with Vlad, then nods.

They round a corner and inside the glass walls of the
conference room, Olivia, Stephen and ABBY (30s) are visible.
They're eating Chinese food, Olivia's sitting on the table,
shoes kicked off, the basket beside her. ABBY's cheerful
and witty but really she's a predator in sheep's clothing.

Quinn stares at the baby, stunned. Then the elevator dings
and three white men in suits rush in followed by the POLISH
AMBASSADOR and his WIFE. When she sees the baby...
BAZYLI!

WIFE

She's crying, moving forward, pulling the baby from Olivia's
hands into her arms. The Ambassador turns to Olivia.
AMBASSADOR
Thank you, thank you. When the
Russians kidnapped him, I
thought...but you've returned my son
to me. Thank you.
And he pulls her in for a hug. One of the men in suits
discreetly hands Stephen a check. He checks the amount,
smiles. The ambassador is still hugging Olivia.
AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
Anything I can do for you. Anything.
STEPHEN
If you have a second child, Olivia
is a beautiful name.
OLIVIA
Mr. Ambassador, you can take your
son back to your consulate and keep
him safe. And you can never tell
anyone about this. The FBI is sick
of me.
Of course.

AMBASSADOR
Thank you, thank you.

And they go. Stephen holds up a hand for silence and our
guys wait, a little breathless, until the Ambassador's group
is out the door before...they celebrate. Some high fives,
some cheers. Stephen spins Abby around; she breathes him
in, flustered. Olivia beams, pulls on her coat. Ready to

Olivia and the others enter. There's a MAN (32) there.
Handsome and charismatic in a John Edwards way. He has a
noticeable limp -- a war injury that only makes him seem
more heroic. Right now, though, his shirt and part of his
face are covered in blood. He eyes them panicked and lost.
And Olivia slips off her coat. Knowing her day isn't over.
MAN
I...I didn't know where else to go.

Stephen, Quinn and Olivia watch him. Abby arrives, hands
out a sheaf of papers.
ABBY
Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan "Sully"
St. James, age 32, did two tours in
Iraq, was injured saving the lives
of his entire unit. A war hero.

patriotic, comes from a long line of
soldiers. Here he is with the
President. Also? Sexiest Man Alive

He kisses her cheek. And then he heads out. And Olivia
peers out of the coat closet to watch as Stephen strides
through the restaurant to a table where GEORGIA (30s), a
pretty sweet woman, sits. As Stephen gets down on one knee.
Pulls out a ring. As he speaks, passionately but nervously.
And then Georgia squeals and kisses Stephen and he puts a
ring on her finger. As the whole restaurant applauds.
And then, as Stephen beams with happiness, Olivia ducks back
out of sight. And then alone in the coat check room, Olivia
starts to cry. Really cry. Painful gut-wrenching sobs.
Stephen's joy making her heartbreak so much more present.
She allows herself just a moment. And then she pulls herself
together, sucks her tears back in and heads out.

I honestly do. And you think you're

you. But the thing is, who you are,
who you love, that shouldn't be a

A long, long beat. And then just as Olivia's giving up,

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A cadre of reporters has gathered. Cameras and lights. And
in front of them all stands Sully St. James in a full dress
military uniform. A few soldiers stand with him. An American
flag hangs behind him. And just off to one side of him, we
see Olivia. As invisible as we've ever seen her. But just
before Sully's going to speak, he glances back at her,
nervous. And Olivia presses a gentle hand to his back.
Soothing him. Urging him forward. And Sully turns back to
the reporters. Calm. Confident. Strong.
SULLY

country. I am honored to have been
injured serving my country. And

It's a moment. A victory. Flashbulbs go off. Questions
are shouted. The press goes crazy. We pull back to find:
Abby and Stephen. Watching. Proud.

The other soldiers are a nice touch,
