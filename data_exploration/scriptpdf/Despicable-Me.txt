EXT: EGYPTIAN DESERT - DAY
FADE IN on a hot, sunny day in the Egyptian desert. Sand
dunes as far as the eye can see. A GOAT HERDER and his HERD
OF GOATS walk through frame. He looks out, over the sand
dunes, and we SEE the GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA. It’s an aweinspiring sight.
Suddenly VROOM! A TACKY TOUR BUS enters the frame and races
through the spot where the goat herder and his herd were just
standing.
Whoa!

GOAT HERDER

The goat herder is left coughing in the dust left by the bus.
EXT: TOUR BUS - SAME
A BRATTY KID squashes his face up against the window of the
bus and lowers his sunglasses to get a better view.
The bus screeches to a halt. The bulk of the tourists pile
out of the bus. Then the last TOURIST FAMILY piles out,
Bratty Kid leading the pack attached to a Kid Leash.
Justin!

TOURIST MOM

Egyptian guards stand behind a roped-off area that surrounds
the Pyramid of Giza. The Tourist Dad stands with the Pyramid
in the background, holding out his hand so it looks like he’s
holding it.
TOURIST DAD
Quick honey, take my picture!
got the pyramid in my hand!

I

The Tourist Mom snaps a couple of pictures, when through her
viewfinder she sees JUSTIN running off into the distance.
TOURIST MOM
Justin you get back here, right
now!
The bratty kid has crawled under the roped-off area.
No stop!

SECURITY GUARD #1

SECURITY GUARD #1
No-- stop him! Do not cross the
line! No!

SECURITY GUARD #2
Go back! Stop! Stop him!
The EGYPTIAN SECURITY GUARDS run after him as he is running
up some rickety looking maintenance scaffolding.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on,
easy little boy.
The kid obliviously keeps playing with his little toy
airplane.
SECURITY GUARD #1
Okay, stop child! Stop right there!
No!
The kid turns back to look at the guards. He YELLS as he
slips and falls off of the ridge, plummeting headfirst toward
the Pyramid.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Oh no, no, no, no, no! -- Oh...
there he goes.
Tourist Mom and Dad GASP.
Then-KOOOSH! The kid hits the Pyramid with his head-- and bounces
off of it.
WHOOOSH! The kid goes flying over the guards. The tourists
raise their cameras and snap away. He heads straight for his
mother. She screams even louder.
TOURIST MOM
JUSTIIIIIIN!
The mom looks up in the sky, tracking the flying boy’s
trajectory.
TOURIST MOM
I’ve got him, I’ve got him!
SPLAT! The boy lands right on top of his father.
The pyramid deflates like a giant bounce house.
PTFPTFPTFPTFFFFFSSSSSSS!

INT: TV NEWS REPORT - NIGHT
A NEWSCASTER reports on the night’s biggest story.
NEWSCASTER
Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was
discovered that the Great Pyramid
of Giza had been stolen and
replaced by a giant inflatable
replica.
FOOTAGE of EGYPTIAN POLICE attempting to re-inflate the
pyramid.
NEWSCASTER
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizen try to
protect their beloved landmarks.
We see FOOTAGE of FRENCH POLICE guarding the EIFFEL TOWER, a
huge line of CHINESE POLICE guarding the GREAT WALL OF CHINA
and a REDNECK with a shotgun guarding the WORLD’S LARGEST
BEER CAN.
NEWSCASTER
Law enforcement still has no leads,
leaving everyone to wonder: which
of the world’s villains is
responsible for this heinous crime?
And where will he strike next?
EXT: PARK - DAY

Gru walks through the park and sees a CHILD. The child is
sad about a dropped ice cream cone. He stops and makes the
child a balloon animal. He gives the child the balloon
animal...and then promptly pops it.
Gru moves the child aside and continues on his way.
EXT: STARBUCKS
Gru walks down the street to his favorite coffee shop.
INT: STARBUCKS
Gru enters. The line is a mile long. With a groan, Gru
pulls out his FREEZE RAY. He aims and...ZAP!
GRU
Freeze Ray, Freeze Ray, Freeze Ray!

Gru laughs and walks to the head of the line past the frozen
customers. He approaches the terrified barista before
daintily taking a cup of coffee from her and plopping a coin
into the tip jar.
EXT: CITY STREET

Cars drive down a busy city street. First a subcompact...
then an SUV...then an ENORMOUS metallic beast of a car, with
Gru at the wheel. He sips his coffee.
EXT: GRU’S HOUSE - MORNING
In the middle of a typical suburban street sits a black,
creepy-looking house. Gru pulls his car into the driveway.
EXT: GRU’S HOUSE - MORNING
Gru walks down from his car toward the fence.
MR. MCDADE (O.S.)
(laughs)
Morning, Gru! How you doing?
GRU
Hello, Fred. FYI-- your dog has
been leaving little bombs all over
my yard, and I don’t appreciate it.
MR. MCDADE
(laughs)
Sorry. You know dogs, they go
wherever they wanna go.
GRU
Unless they’re dead. Just joking,
of course. Although it is true.
Anyway, have a good one!
Ah, okay.

MR. MCDADE
Ah, yeah, hmm.

INT: GRU'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS
Gru walks into the living room carrying his Starbucks and a
muffin. He goes to sit on the couch and sees his dog KYLE, a
cross between a piranha and a pit-bull, SNORING soundly while
lying in the middle of the sofa. Gru frowns.
Gru uses a foot to roll Kyle over. Gru sits down to enjoy
his coffee and muffin. He just turns on the TV when--

DING-DONG! Gru grimaces and gets up from the table.
walks to the front door to see who it is.

He

GRU
Oh, you've got to be pulling on my

Gru arrives at the door, holding a club in his free hand.
hears a little girl’s voice on the other side.

He

VOICE (O.S.)
Helloooooo? Cookies for sale!
Gru stops and looks through his front door peephole,
revealing-MARGO, EDITH and AGNES. Three little girls carrying boxes of
MISS HATTIE’S COOKIES. Agnes holds a RAGGED STUFFED UNICORN.
She’s never without it.
Go away.

GRU
I’m not home.

INTERCUT with Margo and the other girls on the doorstep.
MARGO
Yes you are, I heard you.
GRU
(like a recorded message)
No, you didn’t...this...is a
recording.
MARGO
No it isn’t.
GRU
Yes it is. Watch this-- “Leave a
message--BEEP.”
EXT: GRU’S HOUSE - SAME
Edith kicks the door. There’s a MUFFLED “OW” from the other
side of the door. The girls walk off. Agnes waves.
AGNES
Goodbye recorded message!
MARGO (O.S.)
Agnes, come on!

6

INT: GRU'S LAIR - SAME
Gru walks back into the living room. Kyle is no where to be
found! He looks around and suddenly -- CHOMP! Kyle has
devoured half of Gru’s arm, along with his muffin.
GRU
Kyle! Bad dog!
My muffin!

No, no, no!

Sit!

He tries to shake the dog off when suddenly the TV flashes:
“INCOMING CALL.” It is Dr. Nefario on television. Gru stops
dead in his tracks, with Kyle attached to his arm.
Gru.

DR. NEFARIO

GRU
Ah, Dr. Nefario.
DR. NEFARIO
I know what you must be feeling. I
too have experienced great
disappointment. But in my eyes,
you will always be one of the
greats.
GRU
What? What happened?
DR. NEFARIO
It’s all over the news. Some fella
just stole a pyramid. They’re
saying he makes all other villains
look...lame.
Gru attempts to process this. Is this it?
career? Is his run on top over?

The end of his

Gru somberly replies.
GRU
Assemble the minions.
Gru shakes Kyle off his arm and runs to his Rhino chair.
Then he presses a button and immediately the room converts
into an elevator. The cannon drops from the ceiling and
turns into a pod that drops Gru down a shaft.

GRU
Minions assemble!
A minion who was about to hammer a nail being held by a
fellow minion stops in his tracks. He alerts the others and
we voyage downwards into the lab, peeking in on other rooms
populated by minions. In one room, a group of minions are
doing a form of Minion-aerobics.
As we continue to pan through the lab, we stop on two minions
who giggle as they watch the bubbles gurgle up in a water
cooler. They imitate the bubbles.
The minions stop what they are doing and race down to hear
what Gru has to say.
INT: GRU’S UNDERGROUND LAB - NIGHT
All of Gru’s minions are gathered together for a big
presentation. Gru takes the stage and they explode with
cheers and applause and whistles.
GRU
Looking good, Kevin!
Gru walks on stage.
GRU
How’s the family? Good? Alright.
That’s my Billy Boy! What up,
Larry?
The minions going even crazier, screaming like girls during
Beatlemania.
Gruooooo!

MINIONS
Gruooooooo!!!

GRU
Hello, everybody.

Alright!

Gru tries to get them to settle down.
GRU
Simmer down. Simmer down!
A minion screams.

8

GRU
Thank you, okay.
The minions quiet down.
GRU
Now I realize that you guys have
probably heard about this other
villain who stole the pyramid.
Apparently it’s a big deal -people are calling it the crime of
the century and stuff like that.
We cut back to the minions who take this in.
GRU
But am I upset? No! I am not. A
little. But, we have had a pretty
good year ourselves. And you guys
are alright in my book!
A minion eagerly raises his hand.
MINION
Ooh ooh ooh!
GRU
No, no raises! You’re not going to
get any raises.
The minion frowns.
GRU
What did we do? Well, we stole the
Times Square Jumbo Tron!
Gru gestures to the TIMES SQUARE JUMBO TRON.
GRU
Nice, huh? That’s how I roll!
Yeah, you all like watching
football on that, huh?!
The minions all cheer.
GRU
But that’s not all!
Statue of Liberty!
The minions cheer!

We stole the

9

GRU
The small one from Las Vegas. And
I won’t even mention the Eiffel
Tower!
A minion wheels in a tiny Eiffel Tower.
GRU
...also Vegas.
GRU
Okay, I wasn’t going to tell you
about this yet, but I have been
working on something very big.
Something that will blow this
pyramid thing out of the water!
And now, thanks to the efforts of
my good friend Dr. Nefario...
Gru gestures to DR. NEFARIO, an ancient Dr. Strangelove-like
scientist, in the crowd. He comes riding in on a motorized
rascal cart.
NEFARIO
Thank you, thank you.
GRU
Oh yeah, there he is.

He’s

Gru presses a button on his remote.
GRU
We have located a shrink ray in a
secret lab. And once we take this
shrink ray, we will have the
capability to pull off the true
Crime of the Century! We are going
to steal...
The minions erupt into applause and cheers.
GRU
Wait...wait! I haven’t told you
what it is yet!
They quiet down. Except for one minion who shoots off a
small rocket. KABOOM!

Hey, Dave.

GRU
Listen up, please!

10

Dave quickly calms down. A minion who was caught in the
explosion walks up to Dave and punches him in the arm.
GRU
Next, we are going to steal-- pause
for effect-- the moon!
Gru presses a button, which causes the podium to rise. When
Gru is at the top, the ceiling opens revealing the moon.
GRU
And once the moon is mine, the
world will give me whatever I want
to get it back! And I will be the
greatest villain of all time.
That’s what I’m talkin’ bout!
Gru's CELL PHONE rings.
Yes.

It's DR. NEFARIO.

GRU

DR. NEFARIO
Hello, Gru. I’ve been crunching
some numbers and I really don’t see
how we can afford this. It can’t
be done. I’m not a miracle worker.
GRU
Hey...chillax. I’ll just get
another loan from the bank. They
love me!
Gru raises his arms triumphantly.

The crowd goes crazy.

PAN UP to the moon, then DISSOLVE TO:
EXT: STREET - NIGHT
The moon shines brightly in the sky. Margo, Edith, and Agnes
walk down the sidewalk, Edith leaping from puddle to puddle.
SPLASH! Edith gets water all over Margo.
Oh, Edith!

MARGO
Stop it!

EDITH
What? I’m just walking.
The three girls enter the ORPHANAGE.

The reception area features pink flowery wallpaper and pink
furniture and perfectly stacked displays of boxes of Miss
Hattie’s Cookies. Sitting at the reception desk is MISS
HATTIE.
DING! The girls enter the room and line up behind the yellow
line before they call out to Miss Hattie.

I just wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid. That was
you, wasn’t it? Or was it a
villain who’s actually successful?
The lady of 105 cracks herself up.
INT: GRU’S CAR
Gru isn’t amused.
GRU
Just so you know mom, I am about to
do something very very big. Very
important. When you hear about it
you’re going to be very proud.
INT: DOJO
Gru’s mom isn’t swayed.

She sarcastically baits Gru.

GRU’S MOM
Hah. Good luck with that.
I’m outta here.

Okay,

With a swift kick, Gru’s mom knocks her trainer off screen.
EXT: CITY STREET - A LITTLE LATER
Gru pulls up in front of a bank. There is a small space in
between two cars. SMASH! He knocks one out of the way.
SMASH! He demolishes the other one. Then calmly gets out
and walks inside.
INT: BANK - CONTINUOUS
Gru walks in past the receptionist and into the restroom
carrying his briefcase.
INT: BANK OF EVIL RESTROOM - DAY
Gru enters the restroom. Lasers come out of Gru’s urinal,
reading his eyes. A secret door opens and he enters into the
Bank of Evil.

14

INT: BANK OF EVIL - CONTINUOUS
Gru is now inside the secret underground Bank of Evil
(Formerly Lehman Brothers), which finances all of the world’s
villainy not already financed by a government. Gru takes a
DEEP BREATH. He walks down a hallway featuring a series of
statues of a man being progressively crushed by a pillar.
He then walks to the Loans Desk and addresses the
RECEPTIONIST.
GRU
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, please have a seat.
Gru takes a seat on a red leather sofa. He unrolls a piece
of paper with his master plan on it. He stares at it.
INT: GRU’S CHILDHOOD HOME - FLASHBACK
LITTLE GRU sits in front of the TV watching the Apollo
landing.
NEIL ARMSTRONG (ON TV)
It’s one small step for man...one
giant leap for mankind.

Mom, someday I’m going to go to the
moon!
Gru’s Mom works on a needlepoint.
GRU’S MOM
I’m afraid you’re too late, son.
NASA isn’t sending the monkeys

Little Gru frowns.

His dream crushed.

INT: BANK OF EVIL - DAY
Gru puts down the plan, revealing that sitting across from
him in a black leather chair is a nerdy villain in costume
with glasses, a prominent nose, sloped shoulders, and a pot
belly. His name is VECTOR, and he is cocky way beyond any
realistic assessment of his prowess.
Hey.

VECTOR

Gru goes back to his studying his plan.
and sits next to him.

Vector comes over

VECTOR
I’m applying for a new villain
loan. Go by the name of “Vector.”
Gru is irritated and slides down the couch.
VECTOR
(gives Gru a smile)
It's a mathematical term. A
quantity represented by an arrow
with both direction and magnitude!
He points to the arrow/equation on his chest. Gru attempts
to ignore the guy. He has now moved down to the end of the
couch. Vector slides down to sit right beside Gru.
VECTOR
Vector. That’s me. Cause I’m
committing crimes with both
direction and magnitude. Oh yeah!
Gru continues to ignore the guy. But he won’t stop. Vector
holds up a futuristic-looking gun with a PIRANHA inside the
barrel gasping for air.
VECTOR
Check out my new weapon. Piranha
gun! Oh yes! Fires live piranhas.
Ever seen one before? No you
haven’t-- I invented it. You want
a demonstration?
The piranha falls out of the barrel.
VECTOR
Oh...ah...shoot. So difficult
sometimes to get the piranha back

INT: MR. PERKINS’ OFFICE - DAY
Gru sits across from MR. PERKINS, the bank’s unforgiving loan
manager, a monster of a man with devil’s horn-like hair. Gru
is surrounded by charts and models showing how he’s going to
steal the moon.
GRU
...so all I need is money from the
bank to build a rocket, and then
the moon...is ours.

Wow. Well, very nice presentation.
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

Absolutely. Will do.

Soon as I

Mr. Perkins grimaces, disappointed.
MR. PERKINS
You don't have it? And yet you
have the audacity to ask the bank
for money.
GRU
Apparently.
MR. PERKINS
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you,
Gru? With far too few of your
“sinister plots” actually turning a
profit?
Perkins walks around the room.
MR. PERKINS
How can I put it?
Mr. Perkins pulls an APPLE from his coat.
MR. PERKINS
Let’s say this apple is you. If we
don’t start getting our money
back...
Mr. Perkins squeezes the apple and it explodes.

17

MR. PERKINS
Get the picture?
Gru gulps loudly.

Mr. Perkins returns to his seat.

MR. PERKINS
Look, Gru, the point is there are a
lot of new villains out there.
Younger than you. Hungrier than
you. Younger than you. Like that
young fellow out there named
Vector. He just stole the pyramid.
Gru reacts to this.
stole the pyramid?

That loser he just met in the lobby

GRU
I've got it, I've got it. Um,
so...as far as getting money for
the rocket.
MR. PERKINS
Get the shrink ray. Then we'll
talk.
Gru sighs, defeated.
INT: BANK OF EVIL - DAY
A beaten down Gru leaves Mr. Perkins’ office. He walks past
Vector, who is trying to stick the piranha back in his gun.
Looks around, then casually pulls out his Freeze Ray gun and
freezes his head. Vector moves his eyes to look at Gru
before his body hits the floor.
The piranha jumps into the air and on top of the now
defenseless Vector. He give out a SCREAM as he is bitten.

Oh, Good luck, little girls.
Gru puts binoculars up to his face and reads Margo’s

Gru and the minions struggle to lift the heavy shrink-ray
case. While this is happening, the cookie robots seal up the
hole in the vault trapping Gru and the minions. One of the
minions SHRIEKS in panic.
EXT: VECTOR'S FORTRESS
Bye!

VECTOR

The girls leave his yard and head for the gate. Vector
finally takes a bite of the cookie. The cookie makes a funny
noise and he has a hard time chewing it-- it's a robot.

49

INT: VECTOR'S FORTRESS - AIR DUCTS
Gru and the minions struggle to get the heavy Shrink Ray into
an air duct. One minion grabs the other minion and shakes
him till he glows -- like a glow-stick, it illuminates the
darkened vent.

They race through the air duct carrying the shrink ray.
INT: VECTOR’S FORTRESS - AIR VENTS
They continue on running through the vents until they see a
way out. Gru is carrying the shrink ray and a minion.
WHOOMP! Gru falls through a weak spot in the floor.
INT: VECTOR'S FORTRESS - LIVING ROOM
Gru dangles precariously above Vector, who is mindlessly
watching TV. Below Gru is Vector's PET SHARK which swims
freely through his fortress (under his very chic glass
floors). The shark notices the tender morsel that is Gru
hanging by a thread. He is STRAINING to hold the shrink ray.
The shark LUNGES striking the glass floor.
VECTOR
What the...? Quiet down, fish.
The shark continues to hit the glass floor.
Down, boy.

VECTOR

THUMP! A huge LUNGE knocks Gru and his minions from the
ceiling, but it also knocks Vector off his couch, lodging his
head into his bucket of snacks. Gru takes this opportunity
to make a break for it.
Vector looks around, not sure what just happened.
EXT: VECTOR’S FORTRESS
Gru comes running out, waving his pants around in his arms.
GRU
(laughs)
We did it! C’mon girls, let’s go.
A split second later the minions come running out and smack
into the side of Gru’s car.

50

INT: GRU’S CAR - DAY
Gru and the girls drive home.

Gru is feeling very good.

MARGO
But what about the other people who
ordered cookies?
GRU
Life is full of disappointments.
For some people.
Agnes sees something out the window.
Aaaiighhh!

She points.

AGNES

The vehicle swerves as Gru tries to figure out what is wrong.
GRU
Don’t do that.
Out the window is the MOST FUN AMUSEMENT PARK EVER! The
girls stare out the windows at it, instantly excited.
AGNES
Super Silly Fun Land!
Please?
No.

Can we go?

GRU

EDITH
But we’ve never been! And it’s the
funnest place on earth!
GRU
Don’t care.
GIRLS
PLEASE? WE’LL NEVER ASK FOR
ANYTHING ELSE EVER AGAIN!
PLEASE???
Gru thinks to himself...
MINDFLASH:
Gru is standing at the base of a huge rocket-powered
rollercoaster frame. The girls are in the first cart. He
pulls a lever and the girls shoot off into the distance.
END MINDFLASH.

Gru snaps back to reality, his plan cemented.

The girls get

GRU
Goodbye have fun.
Gru heads towards the exit.
The PARK WORKER turns to Gru.
PARK WORKER
Uh, Sorry dude-- they can't ride
without an adult.
Gru stares at the park worker.
What?

GRU
Ugh.

EXT: ROLLERCOASTER - LATER
CLOSE ON Gru’s face. PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he is on the
rollercoaster as it slowly goes up an incredibly steep
incline. His knees stick out of the tiny car.
Then suddenly the car plummets down. The girls scream,
having the time of their lives. Gru screams, not having the
time of his.
EXT: ROLLERCOASTER - LATER
The rollercoaster goes through several loops and corkscrews
in a row. The girls are loving it. Gru is getting whipped
around mercilessly.

52

EXT: SUPER SILLY FUN LAND - DAY
Several hours of rollercoaster riding later, the girls and a
beaten and battered Gru leave the ride, passing by a photo of
them on a video screen--the girls having the time of their
life. Gru about to throw up, frowns.
Suddenly Agnes sees something off-screen and points.
AGNES (O.S.)
Oh my gosh look at that fluffy
unicorn!
A FLUFFY UNICORN is the main prize at the shooting gallery.
AGNES
He’s so fluffy I’m gonna die!!!
MARGO
You gotta let us play for it.
GRU
No, no, no.
Come on!

AGNES

Gru sighs and addresses the slimy VENDOR.
GRU
How much for the fluffy unicorn?
VENDOR
(chuckles)
Well...it is not for sale. But all
you gotta do to win it is knock
down that little spaceship there.
The vendor points to the smallest of the spaceship targets.
It’s easy!

VENDOR

Gru nods. He slaps a dollar bill on the table. The vendor
slurps on his drink, and presses a button that opens the
curtains and readies the cork guns.
Yay!

AGNES

They take aim and open fire!

This time Agnes’s cork hits the target.

The video sign above the game reads: “YOU LOSE.”

Gru reacts.

He flips through a

Hey, buddy. Let me explain
something to you.
The vendor points to the back of the range.
VENDOR
Ya see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it’s not knocked over?
Do you know what that means,
professor?
The vendor leans over the counter and gets right in Gru’s
face.
VENDOR
It means you DON’T GET THE UNICORN!
Someone’s got a frowny face.
Better luck next time!

Gru stares at the vendor, his blood beginning to boil.

He

GRU
Okay, my turn.
Gru calmly reaches into his coat and pulls out a small gun
that transforms into an enormous RAY GUN.
BLAM! A bright blue RAY BLAST connects with the back of the
shooting range, leaving no sign of the targets just a giant
gaping hole. Gru turns to the vendor.
GRU
Knocked over.
The vendor trembles, silenced. Gru pockets his weapon and
grabs the unicorn. He hands it to Agnes. Margo and Edith
cheer and Agnes hugs the animal tightly.
AGNES
IT’S SO FLUFFY!
MARGO
That was awesome!
EDITH
You blew up the whole thing!
AGNES
Let’s go destroy another game!
And then it happens: actually connecting with the girls and
enjoying being with them, Gru allows a small smile to creep
across his face.
INT: GRU’S LAIR - NIGHT
Gru and the girls return to the lair later that night,
laughing and sharing in the excitement of the day. Gru’s
arms are full of goodies and souvenirs from Super Silly Fun
Land. Gru and the girl’s faces are painted.
Gru hears a THROAT CLEARING.
They all turn and see Dr. Nefario waiting for them.

Okay, girls, go play.
The girls run off with their goodies.

Two minions carry a presentation stand to Gru.
A Large Screen TV turns on revealing Perkins at his desk.
GRU
Sorry to bother you Mr. Perkins,
but I figured that you would want
to see this.
What?

MR. PERKINS

Gru aims the Shrink Ray at a minion on his sofa and fires it.
The minion shrinks to a tiny size.
Another minion comes up from behind the couch and flicks the
shrunken minion through the air. Gru catches the SCREAMING
minion midair and squeezes it like a squeaky toy.
Mr. Perkins looks surprised.
MR. PERKINS
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.
Gru smiles. Everything’s going his way.

The fourth card is a child’s drawing of Gru sitting on the
toilet. It is crudely signed EDITH.
He shoots an angry look off to the side, then turns back to
the camera.
GRU
Sorry, sorry, would you excuse me
for just one second?
Gru smiles then slips out of frame. Mr. Perkins furrows his
brow. Gru storms over to the giggling girls, who stand in
the doorway. He whisper-yells.
GRU
I told you not to touch my things.
I told you, I told you, I told you
a thousand times!
MARGO
(not really paying
attention)

Pizza?

You just had lunch!

Dinner?! Just fine, fine, fine,

Ooooh, stuffed crust!
Gru does his best to keep it together.
GRU
I’ll stuff you all in the crust!

You’re funny.
GRU

rushes back to the podium.
Gru races back to the video monitor and smiles.
GRU
Alright, sorry about that.

...inside. Now I was saying-Suddenly a sound comes from offscreen. Gru glances over to
the door. It’s open again. Where are they?
MR. PERKINS
You don’t seem terribly focused,
Gru.
GRU
Believe me, I am completely
focused. I-Just then, the girls’ faces pop up in the TV's frame.
Hello?

Woah! That guy is huge!

Gru rushes after the girls.

Shouting in hushed tones.

The girls enter with a freeze ray and ZAP Gru!

Gru is stung by this.

We ZOOM into his face.

EXT: BACKYARD - FLASHBACK
Little Gru approaches his mom, who is watering her flowers.
He holds out a picture.
LITTLE GRU
Look, Mom! I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!
She looks at it.

Unimpressed.

GRU'S MOM

Eh.

Little Gru then produces a SCALE MODEL of the rocket in the
picture.
LITTLE GRU
Look mom! I made a prototype of
the rocket out of macaroni!
She looks at it.

Still unimpressed.

Eh.

GRU'S MOM

Little Gru then points to an ACTUAL ROCKET he's built in his
backyard.
LITTLE GRU
Look mom! I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!
He presses a button and the rocket takes off into the sky.
Gru's Mom watches it go.
Eh.

GRU'S MOM

Little Gru is crushed.
END FLASHBACK.
INT.- CONFERENCE ROOM
He falls back breaking the block of ice that had encased him.
He gets up and stares at Mr. Perkins, confused.
GRU
I...don’t understand.
MR. PERKINS
Let’s face reality, Gru. You’ve

far too little success.

Gru walks into the lab. Several minions are playing pingpong while others surround Dr. Nefario.

Now I know there have been some
rumors going around that the bank
is no longer funding us. Well, I
am here to put those rumors to
rest. They are true.
The crowd reacts. Oh no. It’s at this point we reveal
Margo, Edith and Agnes watching from just outside the door.
They exchange looks and then run off.

The crowd is even

GRU
We are doomed. Now would probably
be a good time to look for other
employment options. I know, I have
fired up my resume, as I suggest
that all of you do as well.
The crowd sags even more. Gru stares back at everyone,
feeling horrible. Then he feels a tug on his jacket. Gru
looks down and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes. He frowns.
GRU
What is it? Can’t you see I am in
the middle of a pep talk?
Agnes produces a PIGGY BANK.

Gru stares at it.

He takes the piggy bank, shakes it and it rattles. He opens
it and several coins fall out onto his hand. He stares at
them. Then looks at the girls. Feeling things he’s probably
never felt before.

61

Then one by one the minions produce their own treasured
possessions: wallets, mounted fish, wads of money, a royal
crown.
The minions pile up whatever they’ve got in front of Gru.
The girls smile. Gru looks at all of them with their
contributions. A smile creeps across his face as he gets an
idea.
GRU
Yes. Yes! We will build our own
rocket! Using this and whatever
else we can find! Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the
cars! Who needs the bank!?
The crowd, including the girls, cheers.
MUSIC KICKS IN.

Gru smiles.

MONTAGE

INT: GRU’S LAB - NIGHT
The rocket is in its very beginning stage. Just an engine,
and a frame. They are lowering a recliner into the cockpit
as Gru and Dr. Nefario watch on. A minion who is napping on
the recliner is knocked off and falls.
INT: GRU’S LAIR - DAY
Margo, Edith and Agnes practice ballet in their tutus. A
couple of minions watch, curious. One of them attempts one
of the ballet moves. The other one punches him.
INT: GRU’S LAB - DAY
Dr. Nefario and Gru are working on one of the Rocket engines.
The status screen behind them flashes from STABLE to DANGER.
Gru hands Dr. Nefario a tool and he is able to fix it. Gru
continues to assist Dr. Nefario in building the engine.
INT: LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
Gru opens up his dryer. The girls run and grab their PINK
TUTUS out of it. Gru then removes a pink sock. He next
pulls out his spacesuit. It has turned pink.

INT: GRU’S LAIR - DAY
Gru enters the main room to find his mom sitting on the sofa
with the girls, looking through an old scrapbook. She points
to a picture.
Huh?

GRU
Mom, what are you doing here?

GRU’S MOM
...and there he is in the bathtub.
Oh! Look at his little buns.
INSERT: picture of Naked Baby Gru in the bath on his stomach
with his buns sticking up.
The girls giggle.

Gru is mortified.

GRU
Mom? Not cool.
She points to another picture in the scrapbook.
GRU’S MOM
And here he is all dressed up in
his Sunday best.
MARGO
He looks like a girl.
Ha ha.

GRU’S MOM
Yes he does.

An ugly girl.

INT: GRU’S LAIR - DAY
Margo, Edith and Agnes are again practicing ballet. Now the
two minions are practicing with them. They are both really
into it.
INT: GRU’S LAB
The rocket is much further along. They do test run of the
rockets as Dr. Nefario, Gru and a minion look on.
The girls have decided to use the rocket exhaust to roast a
few marshmallows.
Gru walks over and tries a few of the warm treats. He brings
back a few marshmallows for Dr. Nefario who swats them away.

turns and hugs him.
AGNES

INT: GRU'S LAB - DAY
Gru crosses out another date on his wall calendar. The dance
ticket is paper clipped to the same day as the note STEAL THE
MOON.
The girls call to Gru. He turns and sees they have given
Kyle a makeover. He's as fluffy and prissy as a poodle.

pancakes in evil shapes: a body outline, a dagger, a time
bomb, etc.

Dr. Nefario is back working on one of the Rocket engines.

him tools. Dr. Nefario looks up trying to locate Gru. The
status screen flashes from DANGER to a FLASHING SKULL AND
CROSSBONES.

Gru is showing off for the girls who are having the time of
their lives.
Dr. Nefario walks into the room just in time to have a

And then through the door steps--

Trying to act as if everything’s okay.
Hey, Dad.

You wanted to see me?

MR. PERKINS
Yes I did, Victor.

VECTOR
Duh, back at my place.
MR. PERKINS
Oh is that right back at your
place? Oh that’s cool. I guess
Gru must just have one that LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE IT!
Mr. Perkins flips open his laptop, which displays a freeze
frame from the video conference. It shows Gru holding the
shrink ray. And the girls in the background. Vector stares
in shock. Then points to the girls.
Hey!

VECTOR
Those girls sold me cookies!

He produces a SQUID LAUNCHER. He fires it over the balcony.
It connects with a BANK CUSTOMER off screen.
BANK CUSTOMER (O.S.)

There’s a squid on my face!
Vector cocks the squid launcher as threateningly as you can
cock a fish weapon, causing a new squid to appear.
VECTOR
Don’t worry. The moon is as good
as ours.
INT: GIRLS’ ROOM - NIGHT
Gru tries to put the girls to bed, but they’re running all
over the place.
GRU
Come on, it’s bedtime! Did you

let me smell. You did not. Put on
your PJs! Hold still! Okay,

I am not kidding around. I mean

But we’re not tired.

Well I am tired!
Agnes holds up a copy of the book Sleepy Kittens.
AGNES
Will you read us a bedtime story?

66

No.

GRU

AGNES
Pretty please?
GRU
The physical appearance of the
please makes no difference. It is
still no. So, go to sleep.
EDITH
But we can’t. We’re all hyper.
MARGO
And without a bedtime story we’ll
just keep getting up and bugging
you. All night long.
The girls look up at Gru.
Ahh, fine.

He sighs.

GRU

The girls smile expectantly. Gru takes the book from Agnes
and sits down on the floor next to the girls’ beds.
GRU
Alright, alright. “Sleepy
Kittens.” Sleepy Kittens?
He opens the book, revealing that there are three KITTEN
FINGER PUPPETS attached to it.
GRU
What are these?
AGNES
Puppets. You use them when you
tell the story.
He sticks three of his fingers through the back of the book,
operating the finger puppets. Then begins reading.

“Mommy, we’re not tired at all.”
Their Mother smiled and said with a
purr,
“Fine, but at least you should
brush your fur.”
EDITH
Now you brush the fur.
There is a little BRUSH attached to the page. Gru picks it
up and unenthusiastically brushes the puppet kittens’ fur.
The girls smile.

This is literature? A two year old
could have written this. Alright.
He turns the page and continues reading.

Tears well up in his eyes. The girls look up at him.
Realizing what’s happening, he immediately slams the book
closed.
The End!

GRU
Okay, goodnight!

And he quickly runs for the door.
Wait!

AGNES

Gru stops.
What?

GRU

AGNES
What about goodnight kisses?
Gru tries to keep his emotions in check as he responds.

69

GRU
No! No! No! There will be no
kissing or hugging or kissing.
He leaves.

Margo turns to Agnes.

But scary.

INT: HALLWAY - NIGHT
Gru walks down the hallway, past the framed “Gru Family Tree”
on the wall. Does a double-take, noticing that the girls
have drawn with crayons below it to make themselves part of
the family. Nefario walks up behind him.
DR. NEFARIO
Only forty-eight hours to the
launch. And all systems are go.
Gru is uncomfortable and begins picking up after the girls:
shoes, socks, toys, goldfish crackers, etc.
GRU
Um...about that. I was thinking
that maybe we could move the date
of the heist.
DR. NEFARIO
(ready to explode)
Please tell me that this not as a
result of the girls' dance recital?
Is it?
GRU
No-- the recital? Don’t...that’s
stupid. I just think it’s kinda
weird to do it on a Saturday. I
was thinking maybe a heist is a
Tuesday thing...right?

The ship begins rumbling.

And then expands back to its normal size.

Gru carries their bags to the car as the girls line up next

The recital? I...I am the greatest
criminal mind of the century! I

Gru scoffs and turns back to the rocket, ready for his
mission.
Dave is barely able to catch the ticket without falling off
the platform. He sneaks up and sticks it in one of Gru’s
suit pockets. He whistles like nothing happened.
Gru steps into a hatch in the rocket.

Gru fastens his safety belt and the hatch door slams shut.
He continues to ready the ship for takeoff when Dr. Nefario’s

taking off from Gru’s backyard. His jaw drops.
Just then, Vector runs up beside McDade. McDade watches as
Vector pulls out his squid launcher and aims it at the rocket
and fires.
SPLAAAT! The squid connects with the rocket and sticks to
it. It’s attached to a line which is attached to Vector.
Vector hands the gun to Mr. McDade. The line quickly takes
up slack and-THWOOSH!

Vector is yanked into the sky, after the rocket.

Vector pulls a ripcord and SAILS unfurl on either side of his

The massive pale sphere floats in space. Over the horizon,
Gru’s ship appears. The rockets power down and it silently
hovers above the lunar surface.
SSSSSSSST! Doors open and Gru emerges in a space suit. He
holds the Shrink Ray in his hands and faces the enormous
lunar body.
He stares up at moon. Its size is overwhelming. He feels
like a speck floating in front of it. He smiles and takes
aim at the pale yellow world in front of him. Breathes deep,
then-ZZZZZZZZZZZZZCHEEEEEEEET! A BOLT OF ENERGY fires from the
gun and engulfs the moon. Then slowly, it begins to shrink.
Smaller and smaller. Gru’s eyes widen as the edges of the
moon come into view.

The moon continues to shrink.

Gru does a flip, unhindered by gravity and floats around and
around. He’s giddy as a school boy.
And then, subtly his mood changes. Somehow having the moon
isn’t as satisfying as he thought it would be.
Silently floating in the vastness of space, Gru looks small
and alone. And extremely unfulfilled.
Just then, something drifts out of his pocket. It’s the
ticket to the dance recital. Gru stares at it. Suddenly

Children swing on swings, dig in the sand and play tag. Then

up to the sky and...
TCHEEEWWWWWM! The spaceship roars through the sky, just

A rocket booster falls from the ship, landing on a merry-goround. It IGNITES, spinning the merry-go-round at a hundred

Gru can’t believe it. Then something catches his eye. He
makes his way over to a chair in the front row. Removes the
sign taped to it. Stares at it. Written in child’s
handwriting is-“Margo, Edith and Agnes’ Dad.”
Crushed, he stares at the paper. He turns it over and
suddenly gets a concerned look on his face.
He throws the paper aside and tears out of the Dance Studio.
The paper flutters to the ground. It lands with the backside up. It reads: BRING THE MOON - V.

directly into the camera with fire in his eyes.

Gru stares into the camera, trying to contain his anger.

The missiles launch from the fortress. Gru watches as they
launch outwards, and begin their return towards him.

He stands, determined and at the last possible second acts!
Moving like a maniac-ninja, he leaps through the missiles,
threading the delicate needle, flipping and dodging before
hopping off the last one. The missiles careen into Vector’s
fortress walls and explode!
Gru begins his unrelenting march to the girls. A shark jumps
out of Vector’s moat and dives at him. In one punch, Gru
knocks the beast back into the water.

Vector watches this on a monitor.

Beginning to panic.
