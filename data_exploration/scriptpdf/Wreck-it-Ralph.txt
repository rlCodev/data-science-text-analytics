WRECK-IT RALPH

1

FADE IN:
“INSERT COIN” blinks on the menu screen of FIX-IT FELIX, JR.
We hear a coin being deposited.
EXT. NICELAND - DAY
WRECK-IT RALPH is asleep inside his stump. A voice-over kicks
in, sounding more like a confessional than a traditional V.O.
RALPH (V.O.)
My name’s Ralph, and I’m a Bad Guy.
I’m 9 feet tall. I weigh 643
pounds. Got a little bit of a
temper on me. You know, my passions
bubble very near the surface, not
gonna lie.
A bulldozer removes Ralph and the stump. Ralph’s head pops
out of the stump.
RALPH (ON-SCREEN)
Hey, you moved my stump!
ARRRGGHHHHHH!
Ralph throws a bit of a tantrum.
The NICELAND APARTMENTS are constructed where the stump was.
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Anyhoo, what else? I’m a wrecker. I
wreck -- professionally.
Ralph appears on screen in front of the Niceland Apartments.
RALPH (ON-SCREEN) (CONT’D)
I’M GONNA WRECK IT!
Ralph wrecks the building. He throws a Nicelander.
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I’m very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.
NICELANDERS
FIX IT FELIX!!!
RALPH (V.O.)
Thing is, fixing is the name of the
game. Literally, figuratively,
meta... physically...
FIX-IT FELIX arrives and starts fixing.

WRECK-IT RALPH

FELIX
I CAN FIX IT!!!
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
So yeah, naturally the guy with the
name Fix-it Felix is the good guy.
He’s nice enough as good guys go.
Definitely fixes stuff really well.
But if you’ve got a magic hammer
from your father, how hard can it
be...?
YOO-HOO!

MARY

MARY pops up in a window with a pie. Felix eats the pie, and
a protective hard-hat appears on his head.
RALPH
I guarantee you if he had a
standard issue hammer like the kind
you’d get at the hardware store-he would not be able to fix the
things I wreck as quickly.
The damage is repaired. The screen reads “YOU FIXED IT!”
RALPH (V.O.)
When Felix does a good job, he gets
a medal.
A Nicelander places a little medal around Felix’s neck and
gives him a peck on the cheek.
RALPH (V.O.)
Are there medals for the sweet
science of wrecking? To that I say,
“Ha.”
The Nicelanders pick up Ralph and thrown him off the roof.
Ahhhhhhhh!

RALPH

He lands on the ground in the mud. KER-PLUNK.
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
... And no, there are not.
We pull back from the game console. We’re in...
LITWAK’S FAMILY FUN CENTER
The place is bustling.

WRECK-IT RALPH

CHIRON: “30 YEARS AGO.”
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It’s not like I’m complaining.
Well, it’s a little like I’m
complaining. But I get it. I been
doing this long enough to know a
steady arcade gig’s nothing to
sneeze at.
TIME LAPSE -- The arcade expands over the years. Games get
wheeled out. New games get wheeled in. Owner LARRY LITWAK
takes real good care of the place through the years.
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Seen a lotta games come and go. I
think about all those guys from
Asteroids? Boom! Gone. Centipede?
Who knows where that guy is. No, I
know I’m very lucky.
CHIRON: “TODAY”
RALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It’s just after so many years, it
becomes kind of hard to love your
job when no one seems to like you
for doing it.
The arcade is older now, and all the games are more modern. A
giant first-person shooter game gets wheeled in. The arcade
closes. The “Open” sign shuts off.
The Dance Dance Revolution screen is visible in the
background. On it we see a cycle of the dancer dancing. The
dancer suddenly stops, peeks toward the darkened “Open” sign.
INSET THE GAME: The dancer relaxes.
DANCER
(calling out)
THAT’S IT! ARCADE’S CLOSED!
She and her back-up dancers limp off, rubbing their
shoulders, limping, stretching after a long day of dancing.
INSET STREET FIGHTER GAME CONSOLE: Two fighters, RYU and KEN
stop beating each other.
RYU
What a day. Want to head to
Tappers, Ken?

WRECK-IT RALPH

KEN
If you’re buying, buddy.
They put their arms around each other and walk off screen.
BACK ON THE FIX-IT FELIX CONSOLE: Felix and the Nicelanders
are on the roof.
FELIX
Quittin’ time!
We push through the game screen...
EXT. NICELAND - DAY
The game is now in hyper-realistic 3-D.
FELIX
Good job, everyone!
Felix and the Nicelanders exit the roof as we pan down the
building and get a sense of the world.
RALPH (V.O.)
I dunno, maybe I wouldn’t be
feeling this way if things were
different after work. But as it is,
Felix and the Nicelanders go hang
out in their homes-- which he’s
just fixed.
Ralph picks himself up from the mud. He watches sadly as the
Nicelanders ignore him and carry Felix to the penthouse.
RALPH (V.O.)
And I head off to the pile of
garbage in the dump... where I
live. You might call it a lonely
cesspit of despair on the outskirts
of humanity...which would be
accurate. But I call it home.
Ralph climbs up the brick pile he calls home.
RALPH (V.O.)
I guess I can’t bellyache too much;
I got my bricks. I got my stump.
He pummels the bricks into dust and pulls a pile of bricks
over him like a blanket. He stares longingly at the building.

RALPH (V.O.)
It looks uncomfortable, but it’s
actually fine. I’m good.
CLOSE ON: Ralph, who sighs a very long sigh.
RALPH (V.O.)
But... if I’m really honest with
myself, I see Felix up there,
getting pies all the time, acting
like Captain Fancy. And sometimes I
think...
RALPH’S POV: Through the penthouse windows, he can see Felix
being ushered over by the Nicelanders to a dinner table full
of delicious, warm entrées.
CLOSE ON RALPH: As he speaks out-loud.
RALPH
Man, it must be nice being the good
guy.
Applause. Pull back to reveal...
INT. VIDEO GAME (LIKE A CHURCH BASEMENT) - NIGHT
Ralph sits in a room full of VIDEO GAME BAD GUYS. A sign on
the wall reads: “BadAnon: One Game at a Time.”
CLYDE
Nice share, Ralph. As fellow Bad
Guys, we’ve all felt what you’re
feeling, and we’ve come to terms
with it.
Really?

RALPH

ZANGIEF
(thick Russian accent)
Right here. I am Zangief. I am Bad
Guy.
OTHER BAD GUYS
Hi Zangief.
RALPH
Hi Zangief.
ZANGIEF
I relate to you, Ralph. When I hit
bottom, I was crushing man’s skull

WRECK-IT RALPH

ZANGIEF (CONT'D)
like sparrow egg between my thighs.
(smacking his thigh)
And I am wondering, why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief? Why can’t
more like good guy? Then I have
moment of clarity: If Zangief is
good guy, who will crush man’s
skull like sparrow egg between
thighs? And I say, “Zangief, you
are bad guy. But this does not mean
you are bad guy.”
Claps of understanding.
RALPH
Right. I’m sorry, you lost me
there.
ZOMBIE
(thick Zombie accent)
Arrhh. Zombie. Bad Guy.
Hi Zombie.
Hi Zombie.

OTHER BAD GUYS
RALPH

ZOMBIE
Zangief saying: labels not make you
happy -- good, bad...
(Frankenstein growl)
You must love you.
CY-BORG
Yeah! Inside HERE!
Cy-borg rips out Zombie’s heart, shows it to Ralph.
RALPH
Okay. I gotcha. Watch out; it’s
dripping.
CLYDE
Question Ralph: we’ve been asking
you to BadAnon for years now, and
tonight you finally show up. Why is
that?
RALPH
I don’t know, I just felt like
coming.... I suppose it has
something to do with the fact that,

RALPH (CONT'D)
well, today is 30th Anniversary of
my game.
SATAN
Happy Anniversary, Ralph.
RALPH
Thanks, Satan.
SATAN
It’s sai-tine, actually.
RALPH
Got it. But here’s the thing...
(exhales, then)
I don’t want to be the bad guy
anymore.
GASPS. Bowser spits out his coffee and thus fire.
CY-BORG
You can’t mess with the program,
Ralph.
M. BISON
(miming “crazy”)
You’re not going Turbo, are you?
RALPH
Turbo? No, I’m not going Turbo.
Come on guys. Is it Turbo to want a
friend, or a medal, or a piece of
pie every once in a while? Is it
turbo to want more out of life?
ZOMBIE
Yeeeeesssss.
CLYDE
Ralph, Ralph, we get it. But we
can’t change who we are, and the
sooner you accept that the better
off your game and your life will
be.
ZANGIEF
Hey, one game at a time, Ralph.
CLYDE
Now let’s close out with the Bad
Guy Affirmation.
They all get up, hold hands.

ALL BAD GUYS
I’m bad. And that’s good. I will
never be good. And that’s not bad.
There’s no one I’d rather be than
me.
Ralph doesn’t say the Affirmation. His eyes are wide open-- a
non-believer.
The TITLE burns in over Ralph:
WRECK-IT RALPH
CLYDE
Okay gang, see you next week.
The bad guys break the circle. Satan puts a supportive hand
on Ralph’s back.
SATAN
Hang in there, Ralph.
CLYDE
Hey Zombie, don’t forget your
hatchets.
We pull out to see that the meeting was held in the center
room of Pac-Man. Ralph filches two cherries and catches up
with the others.
TUNNEL TO GAME CENTRAL STATION
The bad guys climb onto a train car and shove off down the
tracks. Ralph sits on the back with the cherries.
INT. LITWAK’S FAMILY FUNLAND - NIGHT
We follow the trail of the train through the power cord of
the Pac-Man game to the power strip.
TUNNEL TO GAME CENTRAL STATION
The characters hop off the cart and make their way into...
GAME CENTRAL STATION
...a huge open concourse full of VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS
bustling about.

GRAND CENTRAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not
leave personal items unattended.
Unattended items will be
confiscated. Report any suspicious
activity to the Surge Protector.
Last call for Tapper wagon,
departing in outlet two. Tapper
wagon, last call. Soul train to
Dance Dance Revolution now boarding
in outlet twelve. All aboard the
Soul Train, outlet twelve.
Ralph passes through the entrance, and a rent-a-cop, SURGE
PROTECTOR, appears out of nowhere. A buzzer sounds.
Ugh.

RALPH

SURGE PROTECTOR
Step aside, sir, random security
check.
RALPH
Random my behind. You always stop
me.
SURGE PROTECTOR
I’m just a surge protector doing my
job, sir. Name...
RALPH
Lara Croft.

SURGE PROTECTOR

RALPH
Wreck-it Ralph.
SURGE PROTECTOR
And where you coming from?
Pac-Man.

RALPH

SURGE PROTECTOR
Ya bring any fruit with you?
Ralph hides the cherries behind his back.
RALPH
Uh... No, no. No fruit.

WRECK-IT RALPH

SURGE PROTECTOR
Okay then. Where you heading?
RALPH
Fix-it Felix, Jr.
SURGE PROTECTOR
Anything to declare?
RALPH
I hate you.
SURGE PROTECTOR
I get that a lot. Proceed.
As Ralph walks through the console. People move out of his
way and whisper things like, “Bad Guy.” “Watch out.”
ANGEL KID
(whispering)
Bad guy coming!
He passes a screen displaying a PSA video narrated by Sonic.
SONIC
If you leave your game, stay safe.
Stay alert. And whatever you
do...don’t die. Because if you die
outside your own game...you don’t
regenerate. Ever. Game over.
Ralph comes upon a group of homeless characters, Q*Bert
amongst them, who hold a sign: “Out of Order. Please Help!”
Ralph hands Q*Bert a cherry.
RALPH
Here you go buddy. It’s fresh.
Straight from Pac-Man’s. Hang in
there guys.
He approaches the entrance to the Fix-It Felix portal. The
buzzer sounds and Surge Protector appears.
Name?
Argh!

A RAGING PARTY
In a gorgeous penthouse. Disco lights spin. Nicelanders dance
and drink. SKRILLEX DJs. Felix passes out hors d'oeuvres.
EXT. NICELAND / FIX-IT FELIX
Ralph arrives on the trolley.
CRACK! SIZZLE! Ralph looks up just as “WE LOVE YOU FELIX”
fireworks burst over the Niceland apartments. Huh?
He digs two bottles out of the trash. He uses them as
binoculars, and aims them at the penthouse...
THROUGH BINOCULARS: it’s a rockin’ party.
RALPH
Happy thirtieth anniversary?
They’re having a party without me?
There are ice sculptures and dancing and a giant buffet
table. Eating his way across the table is PAC-MAN.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Pac-Man! They invited Pac-Man? That
cherry-chasing, dot-muncher isn’t
even part of this game!
He slams the bottles down. They shatter.
CUT TO:
INT. NICELAND PENTHOUSE
Felix struts through the room, happy and proud.
ROY
Great party, Felix.
FELIX
Why thank you, friend.
DEANNA
Felix, you’re needed on the dance
floor.
Deanna drags him onto a colorful dance floor. Felix does his
Fix-it Hammer dance. Everyone follows along.
The door bell RINGS.

WRECK-IT RALPH

12

FELIX
I’ll bet that’s Mario, fashionably
late, per the norm.
GENE
I’ll get it, Felix.
Gene dances to the door and opens it. A smiling Ralph fills
the door frame. Gene GASPS and slams the door.
GENE
It’s Ralph!

(CONT’D)

MURMURS of shock and confusion.
NORWOOD
He’ll wreck the party.
DEANNA
Hide the stemware.
ROY
Get rid of him, Felix.
FELIX
Oh, right. I’ll go talk to him.
Carry on everyone.
Felix pulls out his hammer and heads out.
INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY
Ralph still stands at the door. Felix slips out.
FELIX
Ralph? Can I help you?
RALPH
Hey Felix, I just wanted to check
on you. I saw a big explosion or
something go over the building
there-FELIX
Oh, those were just fireworks.
RALPH
Fireworks. Okay. Is it somebody’s
birthday or...?

WRECK-IT RALPH

13

FELIX
Well, it’s more of an anniversary.
The thirtieth anniversary of our
game, actually.
RALPH
What? Is that today?
I know!

FELIX

RALPH
I’m such a dummy with dates.
Anyway, congratulations.
FELIX
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.
Awkward silence. Finally, the door opens. A Frogger TURTLE
sticks his head out.
TURTLE
Just a heads up, Felix, they’re
bringing out the cake in a few
shakes.
Hi, Glen.

RALPH

TURTLE
(terse)
Ralph.
Turtle shuts the door, fast.
RALPH
Cake. Heard about this cake stuff.
Never had it. No one ever seems to
throw it out, so it never ends up
in the dump. Never actually tasted
it.
...yeah.

FELIX

RALPH
Always wanted to try cake.
FELIX
(shaking his head, no)
I don’t suppose you’d like to come
in and have a slice, would you?

WRECK-IT RALPH

14

INT. PENTHOUSE
Ralph throws the door open and pushes Felix inside.
RALPH
Hey-oh, everybody!
Ralph’s head slams into the ceiling. A large chunks falls
down on Felix YELPS! Felix drops DEAD.
Everyone GASPS in horror. A little flower floats above Felix,
and we hear a quick cycle of DEATH MUSIC.
Felix suddenly regenerates next to Ralph.
FELIX
I’m okay. I’m okay. Fit as a
fiddle.... Now, you all know Ralph.
RALPH
Evening...oops.
(breaking the steps)
Evening Nel. Lucy. Don. Dana.
Deanna.
Big Gene.

DEANNA
RALPH

GENE
(to Felix, annoyed)
Why is HE here?
FELIX
He’s just here for a slice of cake.
RALPH
And I am a big part of the game,
technically speaking... Why are you
here, Gene?
Ralph bends down and he and Gene face off.
Felix steps between them, breaking it up.
FELIX
Oh look, the cake.
Mary wheels out an elaborate cake of the Niceland apartment
building, complete with “We Love Felix” candy fireworks.

WRECK-IT RALPH

15

FELIX
(CONT’D)
Well, I’ll be dipped; you’ve really
outdone yourself, Mary.
The Nicelanders gather around the cake and HAIL PRAISE.
ROY
Oh and look; there’s all of us at
the top.
Ralph approaches and looks over the cake.
INSET CAKE: A little Felix stands on the roof, reaching for a
medal, surrounded lovingly by Nicelanders. But there’s no
sign of Ralph.
MARY
Each apartment is everyone’s
favorite flavor. Norwood’s is red
velvet.
Guilty!

NORWOOD (O.S.)

MARY (CONT’D)
Lemon for Lucy. Rum cake for gene,
and for Felix-Ralph looks for his figurine, and finds himself in the mud,
looking like some sort of deranged troll. His face sinks.
RALPH
Hey Mary, what’s the flavor of that
mud that I’m stuck in there?
MARY
Hmm? Oh, chocolate.
RALPH
Never been real fond of chocolate.
MARY
Well, I did not know that.
RALPH
One other little thing — I hate to
be picky but — this angry little
guy might be a lot happier if you
put him up here with everyone else.
Ralph picks up the little Ralph figurine. He puts him on the
roof, smooshing the cake a little.

WRECK-IT RALPH

My cake.

16
MARY

Ralph pushes an ugly smile onto his figurine’s face.
RALPH
See that? Look at that smile.
GENE
No, no, no. You see, Ralph,
there’s no room for you up here.
Gene knocks Little Ralph back into the mud.
RALPH
Well, what about this? We can make
room. We can take turns. Easy.
Ralph puts Little Ralph back on top of the cake and slams
Little Felix into the mud instead. The Nicelanders GASP.
FELIX
How about we just eat the cake!
GENE
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the
roof, because he’s about to get his
medal.
RALPH
Well, then how about we just take
that medal and give it to Ralph for
once. Would that be the end of the
world, Gene?
Ralph rips the medal off, breaking the delicate fireworks,
and puts it on little Ralph.
GENE
Now you’re just being ridiculous;
only good guys win medals, and you
sir are no good guy.
RALPH
I could be a good guy if I wanted
to, and I could win a medal.
GENE
Uh-huh. And when you do, come and
talk to us.
Gene takes Ralph off the cake.

WRECK-IT RALPH

17

RALPH
And then would you finally let me
be on the top of the cake with you
guys?
GENE
If you won a medal, we’d let you
live up here in the penthouse....
(off Ralph’s look)
But it will never happen...
Gene rips the medal off little Ralph, puts it on little
Felix, and puts Felix back on the top.
GENE (CONT’D)
...because you’re just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.
RALPH
No, I’m not.
Gene slams Little Ralph back in the mud upside down.
GENE
Yes, you are.
RALPH
No, I’m NOT!
Ralph slams his fist down right on the cake. SMASH! Chunks of
cake and frosting cover the Nicelanders. Pac-Man stops
eating. His mouth falls open in shock.
GENE
Yes, you are.
RALPH
All right, Gene, you know what? I’m
gonna win a medal. Oh I am gonna
win a medal! The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen. A medal
so good that it will make Felix’s
medals wet their pants! And good
night. Thank you for the party.
Ralph exits, smashing a hole in the other side of the door.
ROY
Is he serious?

WRECK-IT RALPH

18

GENE
Oh please, where is a Bad Guy gonna
win a medal? Of course he’s not
serious.
SLAM CUT TO:
RALPH’S HAND CATCHING A BEER.
We’re in a bar.
RALPH
I’ve never been more serious about
anything in my life. That’s why I
came straight here, Tapper.
TAPPER the bartender collects the empties in front or Ralph.
RALPH (CONT’D)
You’ve never given me a bum steer.
Now, where can a guy like me go and
win a medal?
TAPPER
I don’t think such a game exists,
Ralph.
RALPH
Come on, you know people. There’s
got to be-MAN (O.S.)
Tapper! Need a root beer!
TAPPER
(to Ralph)
Hold that thought.
Tapper runs off.
OUTSIDE THE GAME CONSOLE: we watch the 8-bit view of the Root
Beer Tapper game as Tapper zips down a row of bars, sliding
beers to other customers.
BACK INSIDE THE GAME: Tapper returns to Ralph’s side.
TAPPER (CONT’D)
You were saying.

I was saying, I can’t spend another
thirty years living alone in the

a medal.
TAPPER
Well, I don’t know what to tell
you. Maybe somebody left a medal
here. You’re welcome to dig through
the lost and found.
SLAM CUT TO:
INT. BROOM CLOSET
Ralph digs through the “lost and found” crate. Behind him we
see a hallway with the saloon doors on one side and restrooms
on the other.
RALPH
Okay let’s see what we’ve got here.
Ralph rummages through the box. A little cockroach scurries
out of the box. Ralph SHOOS it.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Shoo. Shoo. Go.
(back rummaging)
Mushroom. No.... What is this? No.
(picking up a pair of red
briefs)
Oh come on Zangief. Gross.
Ralph sighs, pushes the crate back into the closet, sighs.
RALPH (CONT’D)
What am I doing?
Just then, a heavily-armored space marine enters through the
saloon doors and bumps into Ralph.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Hey, excuse you.
The marine staggers on and right into the wall again and
again, in a walk cycle. Meet PVT. MARKOWSKI.
MARKOWSKI
(mumbling, shell-shocked)
We are humanity’s last hope. Our
mission, destroy all cy-bugs. We
are humanity’s last hope-Ralph stands and looks at him, curious.

RALPH
You okay there, cadet?
Markowski whips around quickly and grabs Ralph by the collar.
MARKOWSKI
We’ve only been plugged in a week.
And every day it’s climb the
building. Fight bugs. Climb the
building. Fight more bugs.
Ralph pries Markowski’s hands off of his collar.
RALPH
Yeah yeah yeah, right. Hey, easy on
the overalls spaceman. It’s tough
all over.
Ralph heads for the door.
MARKOWSKI
And all for what? A lousy medal.
RALPH
Medal? You win a medal?
MARKOWSKI
Yeah. Medal of Heroes.
RALPH
Ooooh. Is it shiny?
MARKOWSKI
Pretty shiny.
RALPH
Ooooh. And it says Hero on it?
Uh-huh.

MARKOWSKI

RALPH
And you said you win it by climbing
a building?
MARKOWSKI
...And fighting bugs.
RALPH
Right. Bugs. Listen: Is there any
chance I could go with you to your
game and get one of those medals--

WRECK-IT RALPH

Negatory.

21
MARKOWSKI

RALPH
Does that mean maybe?
MARKOWSKI
No. Look, only the bravest and the
best serve in our corps-The little cockroach climbs up the wall beside him. Markowski
sees it and squeals like a little baby.
MARKOWSKI (CONT’D)
BUG! AAAAEEEEK!
He goes to run away. But slams into the wall and passes out.
Ralph looks down at him and gets an idea.
INT. BROOM CLOSET — MOMENTS LATER
We see Markowski passed out in his skivvies. An armored foot
kicks Markowski’s leg in, slams the door, and breaks off the
door handle.
It’s Ralph in Markowski’s armor, his gut hanging out. He
SUCKS in his breath, PULLS UP his pants. Breathes a sigh of
relief. His gut pops back out.
INT. GAME CENTRAL STATION
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The arcade will open in fifteen
minutes. Please report to your

A clumsy armored RALPH steps out of the Tapper’s entrance.
RALPH
(to himself)
Okay, what was it called? HeroHero something. Hero’s...Duty!
Hero’s Duty.
He sees soldiers in the same uniform going into a game called
HERO’S DUTY. He follows. He trips over Q*Bert.

RALPH
(flipping up the visor)
Sorry Q*Bert. It’s me, Ralph.

down. He heads for the Hero’s Duty entrance.
Q*Bert watches after him.

RALPH
Rootin’, tootin’, ready for
shootin’!
Just then, SERGEANT TAMORA JEAN CALHOUN steps up before her
men.
CALHOUN
Alright, now listen up ‘cause I’m
only gonna say this once. Fear is a

wanna go pee-pee in your big boy
slacks, keep it to yourself! It’s

I love my momma!
SOLDIER 2
Heads up! First-Person Shooter
coming through.
Soldiers make way for a rinky-dink robot with a flat-screen
head that displays the count-down to game play. Stiff
mechanical arms hold a gun. The wheels are wobbly to simulate
walking. Meet the FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER (“FPS”).
GAME ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Game play in 3...2....
CALHOUN
We are humanity’s last hope. Our
mission: destroy all cy-bugs.
Ralph shoves his way to the front, right behind the FPS.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
You ready rookie? Let’s find out.
The door opens and the view is vicious!
The wind is wild. The terrain is sharp and twisted. Giant CYBUGS fly towards them. They’re part machine, part nature,
with razor-sharp pincers, thrashing metal teeth and laser
wings. A 99-story caustic building rises up out of the
twisted ground behind them.

As soldiers start killing bugs, Ralph runs around in a panic.
RALPH
Oh no, wait, wait, wait!
He raises his gun and shoots randomly.
CALHOUN
Watch it, Rookie! These monsters
are what they eat.
A cy-bug grabs Ralph’s gun out of his hands and eats it.
RALPH
My gun! Hey give that back.
The cy-bug’s arm MORPHS into a gun. It starts shooting. Ralph
SCREAMS and runs away.
CALHOUN
(to the FPS)
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!
A Cy-bug lays a bunch of eggs in front of Ralph.
RALPH
Eww. There’s something coming out
of their bottoms.
OUT IN THE ARCADE: The moppet girl looks confused. Calhoun
steps into frame, grabs Ralph, and throws him off-screen.
CALHOUN
Markowski! Get back in formation.
BACK INSIDE HERO’S DUTY: Calhoun gets back on script.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
All right people, the kitten
whispers and tickle fights stop

CALHOUN (CONT’D)
now, the entrance to the lab is
straight ahead.
Ralph peeks up from behind a rock, looks at the building.
RALPH
I’ll meet you guys inside.
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!
He runs for the building.
No!

CALHOUN

As soon as he crosses the bridge, he sets off a sensors. The
lab doors fly open and a bigger swarm of cy-bugs pours out.
Ralph runs up to the FPS, banging his head on the screen. He
pleads to the screen.
RALPH
Ahhhhhh! Ah! I thought this was
going to be like Centipede! When
did video games become so violent
and scary?
OUTSIDE THE GAME: The gamer sees his face pressed up against
the screen as he blubbers.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Save me! Get me outta here!
BACK INSIDE THE GAME: Ralph uses the FPS droid as a shield.
Take her!

RALPH (CONT’D)

OUTSIDE THE GAME: The gamer watches the camera angle whip up
to the jaws of a giant cy-bug, then flip down as if the FPS
has fallen dead.
Game over.

GAME VOICE (V.O.)

The “GAME OVER” flashes on the screen. The girl slams the gun
into its holder and marches away.
MOPPET GIRL
What a rip-off.
BACK INSIDE HERO’S DUTY: Ralph grapples with the cy-bug who
tries to eat him.

RALPH
Get off me! It’s game over. Stop
it!
BEACON UP!

KOHUT

SOLDIER 1
Cease fire. Cease fire!
A beacon light suddenly shines through the center of the
building and out the top.
The cy-bug suddenly stops attacking Ralph. It turns to the
light, charmed by it. It flies into the light and is zapped
into oblivion, along with all the other bugs.
GAME VOICE (V.O.)
Return to start positions. Return
to start positions.
The FPS robot rises back towards vertical. Ralph dusts him
off.
RALPH
Here, let me help you. Sorry about
that, I just-Annoyed, its mechanical arms swat Ralph away. It rolls off.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Well, yeah, you must be upset.
Calhoun bounds towards Ralph.
Markowski!

CALHOUN

RALPH
Who? Oh, yeah, me, I’m Markowski.
Ralph stands at attention, chin raised, to avoid detection.
Calhoun CLOCKS his helmet with the butt of her gun.
Ow!

RALPH (CONT’D)

CALHOUN
What’s the first rule of Hero’s
Duty?
RALPH
...No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

WRECK-IT RALPH

27

She clocks him again.
CALHOUN
Never interfere with the first
person shooter. Our job is to get
the gamers to the top of that
building so they can get a medal,
and that’s it. So stick to the
program, soldier!
RALPH
Right, right, aye aye!
GAME ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Quarter alert. Quarter alert.
CALHOUN
(walking away)
All right, pussy willows, back to
start positions!
RALPH
Yeah, right. No way I’m going
through that again.... so that’s
where they keep the medal, huh?
He looks up at the formidable building.
CUT TO:
LITWAK’S ARCADE
The moppet that had been playing Hero’s Duty now walks up to
a cheerful racing game called SUGAR RUSH. The marquee
advertises: “New Racers Daily” and “Build your own kart.” Two
BIG KIDS are playing it.
MOPPET
New racers daily, sweet...
I got next game.
The moppet goes to put a quarter on the console. The Big Kid
slides her quarter off with a whole roll of quarters.
BIG KID ONE
Go away, kid. We’re gonna play all
nine of today’s racers.
Yeah!
Sorry.

The Moppet sighs, goes over to Fix-It Felix, Jr. instead.
INSIDE NICELAND: The intro music plays. Nicelanders take
their positions. But Ralph does not. A quote bubble pops up
where he should be, reading: I’M GONNA WRECK IT!
BACK ON THE MOPPET: She looks confused.
MOPPET GIRL
Where’s the wrecking guy?
INSIDE NICELAND: The Nicelanders start to panic.
MARY
Where’s Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.
GENE
Shhh. Stick with the program.
NICELANDERS
Fix it, Felix!
FELIX
(jumping on screen)
I can fix it!
He GASPS in shock to see there’s no Ralph and nothing to fix,
but quickly recovers and smiles for the gamer.
FELIX (CONT’D)
(through gritted teeth)
Ralph. Quarter alert. Game on.
The Moppet Girl makes Felix bounce up the building.
MARY
Do something, Felix.
FELIX
Just act natural. I’ll fix it.
BACK ON THE MOPPET: She freaks as the joystick moves on its
own as Felix climbs down the building and runs off screen.
INSIDE NICELAND: Felix climbs Ralph’s garbage pile. Ralph’s
not there. Felix’s reassuring face turns to panic.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Oh my land. Where is he?
BACK ON THE MOPPET: She’s fed up.

WRECK-IT RALPH

29

MOPPET GIRL
Mr. Litwak!
MR. LITWAK
What’s the trouble, sweetheart?
MOPPET GIRL
The game’s busted.
Mr. Litwak takes a look. He can see the Nicelanders and Felix
panicking on screen and hears nonsensical computer chatter.
MR. LITWAK
Whoa boy, looks like the game’s
gone cuckoo...like my Nana.
(to the moppet)
Sorry, sweetie. Here’s your quarter
back.
He gives her back a quarter.
MOPPET
But what about the game?
MR. LITWAK
I’ll have someone look at it
tomorrow. But if he can’t fix it,
it might be time to put ol’ Ralph
and Felix out to pasture...like my
Nana.
Litwak hangs an OUT OF ORDER sign on the screen.
INSIDE NICELAND: The Nicelanders run out of the building and
watch in horror as the sign eclipses the arcade light.
GENE
Ladies and gentlemen, we are out of
order!
MARY
Sweet Mercy! Without Ralph, we’re
doomed.
ROY
They’re gonna pull our plug!
FELIX
(forced positivity)
Okay everybody calm down. Ralph
probably fell asleep in the
washroom of Tapper’s again.
Just then, a light approaches through the cord.

FELIX (CONT’D)
(relieved)
See? There he is now.
The push-cart arrives, cranked by Q*Bert, not Ralph.

Why it’s Q*Bert. What brings you

CUT TO:
RALPH’S STRAINED, GROWLING FACE.
Pull back to reveal, he’s still in Hero’s Duty. He’s forgone
the armor and he’s climbing the building.
Ralph reaches the top. He peers in the window, sees:
A sea of eggs leads to a chamber in the middle of the room.
Inside the chamber floats the Medal of Heroes.
RALPH
Oooh, shiny.
DOWN BELOW: Soldiers return to Start Position.

GAME VOICE (O.S.)
Attention, the arcade is now
closed.
SOLDIER 1
Did you get a load of Markowski?
Calhoun stops, squints, sniffs. She raises her hand, quieting
her troops.
CALHOUN
Shut your chew holes.
(to herself)
Cy-bug.
We hear a BLING. BLING. Felix steps out of the shadows.
Calhoun reels around starts firing-Taste it!

CALHOUN (CONT’D)

Soldiers open fire on Felix, too. He springs into action,
bouncing, dodging bullets and laser beams. BLING. BLING.
Calhoun finally tackles him, straddles him and pins him down.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Slick tiddly-winking, pint-size.
She drives her gun’s muzzle into his face.
FELIX
I’m Fix-It Felix Jr., ma’am, from
the game Fix-It Felix, Jr.
From the low angle, looking up at her.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Jiminy-jaminy.... Look at that high
definition. Your face; it’s
amazing!
CALHOUN
Flattery don’t charge these

She lets him up.

CALHOUN
Never heard of him....
FELIX
Well Q*Bert saw him come in here.
CALHOUN
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.
A CRASH is heard from above.
KOHUT
That came from the tower!
They look and see Ralph’s shadow on the top floor made giant
by the beacon light.
ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE LAB: Ralph punches the window, breaks
it, and steps in. He does his most careful TIP-TOE across a
sea of eggs.
RALPH
Nice little eggs... excuse me...
He climbs the steps up to the chamber, triggering a giant
hologram head to appear.
GENERAL HOLOGRAM
Congratulations soldier. It is my
honor to bestow upon you the Medal
of Heroes.

Wow.

RALPH
(in awe)

The medal floats down to him. As it does, we see...
RALPH’S PENTHOUSE PARTY — VISION
-Ralph is on the dance floor surrounded by Nicelanders doing
the Wreck-it Ralph dance.
-Mary wheels out a cake with a handsome Ralph on top, wearing
his Medal of Heroes and being hugged by the Nicelander
figurines.
-Gene is outside in the brick pile looking longingly up at
the party through binoculars. He cries.
BACK TO REALITY: The medal lands around Ralph’s neck.
RALPH (CONT’D)
No way. Ho-ho-ho. Wow!

WRECK-IT RALPH

33

GENERAL HOLOGRAM
Ten hut! History will long revere
your courage and sacrifice.
More holograms of space Colonels and Generals surround him.
Heroic music plays. Ralph backs down the steps, smiling and
waving to the holograms.
GENERAL HOLOGRAM (CONT’D)
You have etched in the rock of
virtue, a legacy beyond compare.
RALPH
Thank you. Thanks guys. At ease!
GENERAL HOLOGRAM
You are the universe’s greatest
hero.
CRACK! Ralph steps on an egg. SMASH! The egg shatters.
RALPH
Oops. Aye-yai-yai.
Ralph leans in for a closer look. The baby bug opens its eyes
cutely and then attacks. It attaches itself to Ralph’s face.
RALPH (CONT’D)
...The living embodiment of all
that this corps represents:
Bravery, integrity, grace under
pressure, and above all, dignity.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Ahhhhhmmmffff!
Ralph stumbles around, flies back and into one of the space
pods. A harness immediately locks him in place. The door
slams shut.
GAME ANNOUNCER
Escape pod activated.
The engine fires and then BOOM! The space pod bursts out of
the top of the building.
INSIDE THE POD: Ralph struggles to pull the cy-bug off him.
RALPH
(struggling)
Get off my face!
BACK OUTSIDE: The pod barrels down on Calhoun and Felix.

WRECK-IT RALPH

The pod flies over the heads of Calhoun and Felix. As it
passes by, Calhoun sees the cy-bug on Ralph’s face.
Cy-bug.
Ralph!

The pods flies out of the game into tunnel to Game Central.
INT. GAME CENTRAL STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Ralph’s pod blasts into the terminal, spiralling like an outof-control bottle rocket off the floor and walls. Ralph tries
to pry the bug off of his face. POP! It lets go.
Ha ha!

RALPH

But then the bug starts to grow, fast.
Oh no!

RALPH (CONT’D)

The space pod launches into the tunnel of another game. The
blackness of the tunnel turns pink. Globs of pink goo collect
on the windshield.
SHIP’S ROBOT VOICE
Engine Failure. Engine Failure.
RALPH
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
The space pod CRASH LANDS in...
A CANDY WORLD
It destroys a slice of countryside before stopping at the
edge of a cliff. Ralph and the cy-bug slam against the dash.
Something beeps. It’s the EJECT button!
RALPH
Uh-oh. Whoaaaaaaaa!!!
Ralph and the cy-bug catapult out of the ship. Ralph lands at
the top of a tree. The cy-bug continues on and slams into a
nearby tree. It falls into a taffy pool and sinks as if dead.

WRECK-IT RALPH

RALPH (CONT’D)
Sayonara, sucker!
From his vantage point Ralph can see a candy race track and a
bunch of dessert go-karts whizzing by. A giant sign glistens:
SUGAR RUSH.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Sugar Rush? Oh no, this is that
candy go-kart game over by the
Whack-A-Mole. I got to get out of
here.
He wipes the stickiness off on his shirt and realizes that
his medal is gone.
RALPH (CONT’D)
No! No-no-no-no-no-NO! My medal!
He spots the medal dangling from the highest branch of a
peppermint tree. Ralph quickly climbs down the tree as it
shakes from his weight.
CUT TO:
THE MEDAL IN THE PEPPERMINT TREE — MOMENTS LATER
The tree is surrounded by a bubbling taffy pool. Ralph
teeters across some wobbly gum drops floating in the pool. He
grabs the tree and climbs, eyes on the medal.
Hi mister!
AHHH!

VANELLOPE (O.S.)
RALPH

He looks up, terrified. But it’s only VANELLOPE VON SCHWEETZ,
a 9-year-old girl, looking down from a branch above him.
Hello!

RALPH
Man! You scared me, kid! I nearly
soiled myself!
VANELLOPE

VANELLOPE
You’re not from here, are you?
RALPH
No, well, yeah, I mean not from
right in this area. But I’m just
doing some work here.
VANELLOPE
What kind of work?
He continues climbing.
RALPH
Some routine candy-tree trimming.
You probably want to stand back. In
fact, this whole area is
technically closed while we’re
trimmin’ so-Who’s we?

VANELLOPE

RALPH
Candy-tree department.
He climbs higher.
VANELLOPE
Ah. Where is everybody else?
RALPH
Oh, it’s just me, today.
VANELLOPE
So, you just meant like the royal
we?
RALPH
Yup. That’s right.
Vanellope springs up to a branch by his face and hangs upside
down.
VANELLOPE
Are you a hobo?
RALPH
No, I am not a hobo. But I am busy,
so you go, go home.

I try to be nice.
RALPH
You’re mimicking me.
VANELLOPE

You’re mimicking me.
RALPH
Okay, that is rude, and this
conversation is over.
He climbs on.
VANELLOPE
(still mimicking)
That is rude and this conversation
is....hahaha.
(watching him)
I wouldn’t grab that branch if I
were you. It’s a double stripe.
RALPH
I’m from the candy-tree department.
I know exactly-He grabs the branch. DING! SNAP. Ralph Falls.
--WHOA!

RALPH (CONT’D)

He barely manages to catch a lower branch with one hand.
VANELLOPE
Double stripes break, ga-doi.
Hey, why are your hands so
freakishly big?
RALPH
Uh, I dunno. Why are you so
freakishly annoying?

WRECK-IT RALPH

VANELLOPE
Well, why are you so freakishly-Just then, she notices the glistening medal.
VANELLOPE (CONT'D)
Sweet mother of monkey milk! A gold
coin!
RALPH
Don’t even think about it. That is
mine.
VANELLOPE
Race you for it!
Vanellope moves like a monkey up the branches. Ralph follows.
RALPH
I don’t have to race you for it,
because it’s mine.
Grabs a double stripe. DING! It BREAKS!
VANELLOPE
Double stripe!
Vanellope makes it to the top and grabs the medal.
RALPH
Come back here! Give it back, give
it, give it!
VANELLOPE
The winner! Whoa!
Ralph grabs the branch she’s on and flings her off. She drops
the medal. He catches it. She dives for it, misses. Ralph
lands on a double-stripe. DING!
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Double stripe!
CRACK. He falls. The medal goes flying again.
RALPH
Aahhh! Nooooooo!
He grabs the bottom branch and hangs inches above the
BUBBLING taffy. Vanellope snags the medal.
Thank you.

She hops off the tree to the ground, safely beyond the taffy.
RALPH
Look, wait. Let me talk to you for
one second. Here’s the thing, I’m
not from the candy tree department.
VANELLOPE
Lying to a child. Shame on you,
Ralph.
RALPH
But I wasn’t lying about the medal.
That is my medal. That’s why I was
climbing the tree. It’s mine. It’s
precious to me.
Vanellope polishes the medal, admiring it.
RALPH (CONT’D)
That thing’s my ticket to a better
life.
VANELLOPE
Yeah, well now it’s my ticket.
Vanellope glitches.
RALPH
What the...?
VANELLOPE
See ya, chump.
She runs off.
RALPH
Come back! I’ll find you! I will
find you!
Ralph hears a DING. He looks up. CRACK!

Double stripe!
Ralph falls into the gooey taffy pool! He bubbles up, looking
like a taffy beast.

Nowhere to hide!
He disappears back beneath the sticky surface.

barreling down there into that
sweet, little game like a crazy
person.
Calhoun studies the entrance to Sugar Rush.

Do you even know what a Cy-Bug IS?
FELIX
I can’t say that I do, ma’am.
CALHOUN
(like talking to a child)
Cy-Bugs are like a virus. They
don’t know they’re in a game. All
they know is eat, kill, multiply.
Without a beacon to stop them,
they’ll consume Sugar Rush. But do
you think they’ll stop there?
Yes.

WRONG! Viruses do not stop!
She stands up straight and majestic and looks over Game
Central to all the tunnels leading to so many games.

Once those Cy-Bugs finish off Sugar
Rush, they’ll invade every other

Kohut hands her what looks like a folded surf board. Calhoun
heads down the steps to the tunnel.
FELIX
(to Kohut)
Sheepers. Is she always this
intense?
KOHUT
It’s not her fault. She’s
programmed with the most tragic
back story ever. The one day she
didn’t do a perimeter check... her
wedding day.
Calhoun stares down the dark tunnel.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. CHURCH: Calhoun and an incredibly handsome soldier,
BRAD, are about to exchange vows at the altar. Just then a
giant cy-bug crashes through the stained-glass window and
CHOMPS down on the groom. Calhoun pulls out her automatic
weapons and starts shooting through RAGING WAILS.
SMASH CUT TO:

Felix hurries up to her in the tunnel.

Wait, Ma’am! I’m going with you!

Like fun you are, short stack. You

The stands are full. Racers zip up to the starting line in
their go-karts. Bright royal music plays.

clenched between her teeth.

ON THE TRACK: We scan across the racers standing proud in all
their candy racing gear as King Candy explains the rules.

The first nine racers across that
finish line will represent Sugar
Rush as tomorrow’s Avatars.
CROWD
RACE! RACE! RACE! RACE!
KING CANDY
Yes, okay. Calm down. Listen, this
event is pay-to-play. We all know
this. The fee to compete is one
gold coin from your previous
winnings; if you’ve ever won, which
I have. Let me go first.
King Candy pulls a lever and a rainbow sweeps across the
starting line. King Candy throws his gold coin into the air.
It’s caught on a rainbow slide and swept into a giant pot.
King Candy’s name appears on a CONTESTANT board.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
King Candy!
King Candy leaps into the air with a flourish and poses. The

The first racer, a strawberry-pink, go-getter, tosses up her
coin. We follow it and watch it land in the pot, where it
turns into game code and then disappears into an abyss.

It’s Vanellope’s turn. She kisses the medal and throws it.
It’s caught by the rainbow, rims around the pot before
dropping in. The pot glitches. The medal swirls inside it,
turns into game code, and disappears into the abyss.
KING CANDY
(covering the mic)
Sour Bill, who’s that last one?
The board glitches and then a new racer appears on it:
VANELLOPE VON SCHWEETZ. The crowd gasps in horror.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

VANELLOPE
Yippee! I’m in the race!

Taffyta rips the tarp off of Vanellope’s kart, revealing a
sad kart made from recycled junk with the name “Lickity

The crowd starts to panic.

Just then a taffy-covered Ralph -- twigs and candy stuck to

creature from the taffy lagoon.

(pointing at her)
YOU! Give me back my medal right
now.
Oh boy.

What is that?
Ralph chases Vanellope.

Get back here.
Vanellope slips under a spectator’s box. Ralph lifts up the
box, revealing her.

Nowhere to hide!
Whoa!

She scurries back under the next box.
Ralph follows her, tipping box after box. Spectators scatter.
RALPH
Get out of my way!

Careful! What are you doing?!
Vanellope runs out from under then stands. Ralph follows. He
slams into a giant cupcake, water tower. It tips.

Huh?

(looking up)

The giant cupcake falls onto him. His taffy-covered head pops
out the top. He tips over.

Can’t move.
WYNNCHEL
Now we got him.
The donut cops rush up to a helpless Ralph -- who points to
where Vanellope went and mumble-yells.
RALPH
OH GOOD, THE COPS. SHE WEN DAAAWAY!
They ignore him and knock him with their batons.
DUNCAN
Hold still.
Take that.

RALPH
Hmmmmay! What’re you doing?!
KING CANDY
(into his microphone)
Okay folks. Calm down! Everything’s
all right. The monster’s been
caught. We’ll repair all the
damage. Don’t worry, we will have
our race before the arcade opens.
VANELLOPE
And I’m in it.
Vanellope hops into her kart and pedals off.

(to the other racers)
There’s no way that I am racing
with a glitch. Rancis, Candlehead,

KING CANDY (CONT'D)
(point down to Ralph)
And bring that THING to my castle.
Wynnchel switches to using a taser on Ralph.
RALPH
She took my me-- Aaaahhhhhh!!!
CUT TO:
EXT. KING’S CANDY CASTLE
OREO GUARDS march and chant outside a grand candy palace.
OREO GUARDS
(chanting)
O-re-o. O-ree-o. O-re-o. O-ree-o.
INT. KING’S CANDY CASTLE
The donut police roll the Ralph cupcake/taffy ball into a
frilly throne room. King Candy drives his kart right into the
room and backs it into his THRONE parking spot.
KING CANDY
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster
so we can see what we’re up against
here.
Mmmm-kay.

SOUR BILL

Sour Bill pulls off a giant glob of taffy, exposing Ralph’s
face and head.
RALPH
Waaahhhhhh!
KING CANDY
Milk my duds, it’s Wreck-it Ralph?!
RALPH
(getting his bearings)
Yeah. Who are you, the guy that
makes the donuts?
KING CANDY
Please. No, I’m King Candy.
RALPH
I see you’re a fan of pink.

WRECK-IT RALPH
KING CANDY
Salmon. Salmon. That’s obviously
sal-- What are you doing here?
RALPH
Look, you’re candiness, this is
just a big misunderstanding. Just
get me out of this cupcake, I’ll
get my medal, and I’ll be outta
your way.
KING CANDY
YOUR medal? Bad guys don’t win
medals.
RALPH
Well, this one did. I earned it
over in Hero’s Duty.
KING CANDY
You game-jumped? Ralph, you’re not
going Turbo are you?
RALPH
What? No, no no.
KING CANDY
Because if you think you can come
in here to my kingdom and take over
my game, you’ve got another thing
coming.
RALPH
Easy your puffiness. It’s not my
fault one of your children of the
candy corn stole my medal!
KING CANDY
Children of the candy corn? Who?
(realizing, GASP)
The glitch! The coin she used to
buy her way into the race, that was
your medal?
RALPH
She did what...? I need that back!
KING CANDY
Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
It’s gone, it’s nothing but code
now. And it’ll stay that way until
someone wins the cup at the end of
the race.

48

WRECK-IT RALPH

49

RALPH
Well, maybe I’ll just have to have
a little talk with the winner then.
KING CANDY
Is that a threat I smell-- beyond
the halitosis you so obviously
suffer from?
RALPH
Listen Nillie Wafer, I’m not
leaving without my medal.
KING CANDY
Yes, you are. Wynnchel, Duncan, get
him out of that cupcake and on the
first train back home. And if I
ever see you here again, Wreck-it
Ralph, I’ll lock you in my fungeon.
Fungeon?

RALPH

KING CANDY
Fun Dungeon. It’s a play on
words.... Nevermind. Now, I’ve got
a glitch to deal with, thanks to
you. Goodbye Wreck-it Ralph. It
hasn’t been a pleasure.
King Candy hops into his kart and drives out of the room.
Wynnchel knocks on the cupcake.
DUNCAN
This thing’s hard as a rock.
WYNNCHEL
I can see that. Get the tools.
RALPH
What tools?
Wynnchel hits Ralph with the baton.
WYNNCHEL
Quiet, you.
Duncan goes over to a chest, pulls out a chain-saw, and revs
it up.
RALPH
What? No! Ah! Stay away from me!

WRECK-IT RALPH

50

WYNNCHEL
Hey, take it easy, big boy.
Ralph flails. He rolls back onto his feet and starts hobbling
towards the door.
DUNCAN
He’s getting away!
The Oreo guards block his way, shouting “Oreo.” He turns and
eyes two giant windows.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE THE DOUBLE CASTLE WINDOWS
Ralph and the cupcake burst through the wall and fall.
BACK INSIDE THE CASTLE
Wynnchel and Duncan run to the window. They look down and see
the smashed cupcake on the ground and Ralph running away.
WYNNCHEL
Quick, call out the devil dogs.
CUT TO:
EXT. LOLLISTIX FOREST - A SHORT WHILE LATER
DEVIL DOGS on leashes bound through the trees and down the
ravine. They stop by a chocolate stream. They lose the scent
and run off down river.
A pixie stick, poking out of the stream, moves. Ralph breaks
the surface.
RALPH
Argh... I hate chocolate.
(scrambling to the shore)
Got to get my medal back.
He hears the ROAR of engines. Sees a bunch of racers speed by
on nearby road.
RALPH (CONT’D)
The pot goes to the winning racer.
He runs after them.

WRECK-IT RALPH

51

RALPH (CONT’D)
Hey, kids! Can I talk to you for a
second?
He just misses them, as they disappear around the bend and
approach Vanellope, who is working on her handmade kart. It’s
up on a jacks.
The racers sweep in and surround her. She pushes away any
evidence of fear and stands tall to meet them.
VANELLOPE
Hello, fellow racers!
Ralph peeks over the hill.
RALPH
It’s that little crumbsnatcher.
VANELLOPE
Taffyta, Rancis, you’re looking
well. Came by to check out the
competition, huh? Well, here it is,
The Lickity Split.
ON RALPH: unimpressed.
RALPH
Jeesh. Looks like she built it
herself.
BACK ON THE KIDS: Taffyta gets out of her kart and approaches
Vanellope.
VANELLOPE
Built it myself. Fastest pedalpower west of the Whack-A-Mole.
Check her out.
Vanellope hops in her kart and starts pedalling. The gears
catch and spin.
TAFFYTA
Oh, Vanellope, it’s so...you. But
you have to back out of the race,
yeah.
Vanellope gets out of her kart and approaches Taffyta.
VANELLOPE
Oh, no I don’t, because I paid my
fee. I’m on the board. So, yeah,
I’m definitely racing.

WRECK-IT RALPH

52

TAFFYTA
Well, King Candy says glitches
can’t race.
VANELLOPE
I’m not a glitch, Taffyta.
(she glitches)
I’ve just got Pixlexia, okay?
Ignoring her, Taffyta walks over to Vanellope’s kart.
TAFFYTA
The rules are there for a reason,
Vanellope. To protect us.
(getting in Vanellope’s
kart)
Say I’m you. I’m in my weird little
car, and I’m driving, and I
actually feel kinda cool for once.
And then, all of a sudden, oh no!
I’m gl-gl-gl-gl-itching!
Taffyta shudders and then rips the steering wheel right off.
Hey!

VANELLOPE

TAFFYTA
See? You’re an accident just
waiting to happen.
JUBILEENA
Oh no, I glitched, too.
Jubileena goes over to the kart, flails and crashes into it,
ripping off the brake. Vanellope rushes over to her kart, but
other racers get in her way and block her.
ON RALPH: Disturbed by what he’s seeing.
Uncool.

RALPH

BACK ON THE KIDS: The other racers tear apart the kart.
VARIOUS RACERS
Oh no, I glitched. I glitched. Look
out, I’m glitching.
VANELLOPE
Stop. You’re breaking it! No!
Please.
Vanellope grabs Taffyta and spins her around to face her.

WRECK-IT RALPH

53

VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
I just want to race like you guys.
TAFFYTA
You’ll never be a racer, because
you’re a glitch...and that’s all
you’ll ever be.
Taffyta pushes Vanellope, who goes flying back, and lands
SPLAT in the mud.
ON RALPH: That’s the last straw; he jumps up.
RALPH
Hey! Leave her alone!
He runs down the hill, flails his arms, and throws mud at the
kids. They SCREAM in terror.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Scram, you rotten little cavities,
before I throw YOU in the mud!
The racers drive off. Ralph puffs up. He turns to Vanellope.
She wipes away tears, while sifting through the wreckage of
her kart.
VANELLOPE
What are YOU looking at?
RALPH
You’re welcome, you rotten little
thief.
VANELLOPE
I’m not a thief. I just borrowed
your stupid coin. I was gonna give
it back to you as soon as I won the
race.
RALPH
It’s not a coin. It is a medal.
VANELLOPE
Coin. Medal. Just go back to your
own dumb game and win another one.
RALPH
I can’t. I didn’t win it in my
game. I won it in Hero’s Duty.
VANELLOPE
Hero’s Doodie?! Ha!

WRECK-IT RALPH

54

RALPH
It’s not that kind of duty.
VANELLOPE
I bet you really gotta watch where
you step in a game called Hero’s
Doodie. What did you win a medal
for? Wiping? I hope you washed your
hands after you handled that medal.
Listen.

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Wait. One more. One more: why did
the hero flush the toilet?
Say why...
Why.

VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
RALPH

VANELLOPE
Because it was his doodie.
RALPH
How dare you insult Hero’s Duty,
you little guttersnipe! I earned
that medal, and you better get it
back for me, toot-sweet, sister!
VANELLOPE
Well, unless you’ve got a go-kart
hidden in the fat folds of your
neck, I can’t help you.
Ralph makes like he wants to crush her, but forces himself to
smash a nearby candy tree instead. He then punches a giant
jawbreaker. It doesn’t so much as crack. He tries again.
Nothing. Incensed, he pounds on it-- temper-tantrum style.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
What a moron.
(calling to Ralph)
Hey genius, it’s a jawbreaker!
You’re never gonna break-(as he breaks it)
...that...?
That gives her an idea.
Hmmm.

VANELLOPE (CONT’D)

WRECK-IT RALPH

55

Ralph plops down on a rock, out of breath. Vanellope comes
over and leans against a nearby jawbreaker.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper
baby?
RALPH
Leave me alone.
VANELLOPE
Look, you want that medal, right?
And I want to race. So, here’s what
I’m thinking; you help me get a new
kart, a real kart, and I’ll win the
race and get you back your medal.
RALPH
You want me to help you?
VANELLOPE
All you got to do is break
something for me. Come on, what do
you say, friend?
She holds out a hand. He doesn’t take it right away.
RALPH
We are not friends.
VANELLOPE
Ah come on, pal. You son of a gun.
Come on buddy, let’s shake on it.
Come on chumbo. Ralph, my man. My
main man. Hey, my arm’s getting
tired. We have a deal or not?
RALPH
You better win.
He takes her little hand, and they shake on it.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUGAR RUSH, CRUISER, FLYING - DAY
Felix and Calhoun get a bird’s eye view of Ralph’s wreckage.
CALHOUN
I’ll say this much, they don’t call
your friend Wreck-It for nothing.
There’s the shuttle!

WRECK-IT RALPH

56

She lands the cruiser.
EXT. SUGAR RUSH, THE BROKEN SHIP
Calhoun does a military run up to the ship, gun raised. She
circles it, checks the cockpit.
Felix approaches cautiously.
FELIX
Is he in there?
CALHOUN
Nope. Lucky for him, otherwise I
would have slapped his corpse....
No cy-bug either.
She pulls out her tri-quarter bug sensor and starts scanning.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Got to find it before it lays its
filthy eggs.
CUT TO:
EXT. CANDY CANE FOREST, TAFFY PIT
Calhoun and Felix pass the pit. She’s getting a faint signal
on the sensor. It scrambles. She smacks it. It scrambles
more.
CALHOUN
(with disgust)
Argh. This atmosphere is full of
sugar particles, and it’s jamming
my Sensor with funny fudge.
They walk on.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
So, what is it with this Wreck-it
joker? Why’d he go AWOL?
FELIX
I wish I knew, ma’am. He was acting
all squirrelly last night-- going
on about cake and medals.
(distraught)
But I never thought he’d go Turbo.
CALHOUN
Go Turbo...?

WRECK-IT RALPH

57

FELIX
That’s right, guys just got plugged
in. Well, back when the arcade
first opened...
FADE TO:
INT. LITWAK’S ARCADE, EARLY 80S - FLASHBACK
Simpler days. 80s music. 80s kids play classic games -- FFJ,
PAC MAN, and an 8-bit racing game called TURBO TIME. We meet
TURBO -- basically a giant smiley face in a generic car,
racing on a generic road.
FELIX (V.O.)
... Turbo Time was by far the most
popular game.
Turbo crosses the finish line and gives us a giant thumbs-up.
TURBO
TURBO-TASTIC!
FELIX (V.O.)
And Turbo-- well, he loved the
attention.
Turbo takes the first-place spot on a podium. He blocks the
second-place racer down with a wave of his trophy and blocks
the third-place racer from view with his Turbo thumbs-up.
FELIX (V.O.) (CONT’D)
So when RoadBlasters got plugged in
and stole Turbo’s thunder, boy was
he jealous...
RoadBlasters is wheeled in. Kids abandon Turbo Time to play
it. TURBO is left mid-game. He stops and looks across the
arcade to Pole Position. His big smile turns to a frown.
FELIX (V.O.) (CONT’D)
So jealous that abandoned his
game...
POWER STRIP: We watch the little Turbo dots cross the power
cord from his game to RoadBlasters.
FELIX (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and tried to take over the new
one.
ROADBLASTERS — SHORT TIME LATER

WRECK-IT RALPH

58

A frustrated kid tries to play RoadBlasters, but the screen
is in chaos -- an 8-bit Turbo glitches all over the track,
causing the kid to crash his car.
KID 1
Is that-- that looks like Turbo!
KID 2
Aw what’s Turbo doing in this game?
(crashing)
Aw c’mon!
KID 1
Mr. Litwak!
FELIX (V.O.)
Turbo ended up putting both games
and himself out of order, for good.
A WORKER wheels out both Turbo Time and Pole Position.
BACK ON CALHOUN AND FELIX: Calhoun shakes her head.
CALHOUN
The selfish man is like a mangy dog
chasing a cautionary tale.
They step onto a fallen peppermint tree acting as a bridge
over a ravine.
FELIX
I know, right? That’s why I have to
get Ralph home, or the same thing’s
gonna happen to my game.
DING! DING! The entire tree is double stripe. It blinks.
Huh?

FELIX (CONT’D)

The tree disappears. They fall into a pit of chocolate
powder.
CALHOUN
What is this?
A sign reads: NESQUIK SAND.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Nesquik Sand?
They start sinking. Felix panics.

WRECK-IT RALPH

59

FELIX
Quik sand?! I’ll hop out and grab
you one of those vines!
Calhoun stands calm, sizing up the situation. Felix flails as
he tries to hop out of the sand. But his usual “boing” is
more like a “bllllrgh” as the sand swallows him.
FELIX (CONT’D)
I can’t hop. I’m hopless! This is
hopeless! We’re gonna drown here!
CALHOUN
Stop thrashing! Stop moving-you’re making us sink faster!
He’s still panicking. Calhoun slaps him in the face.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Get a hold of yourself.
He looks at her, shocked. Suddenly they hear GIGGLING. They
look up to see Laffy Taffy vines hanging from a tree. As the
vines giggle, they stretch and lower towards them.
FELIX
Those vines. They’re Laffy Taffy.
They’re attracted to whatever makes
them laugh. Here, hit me again.
She smacks him, lightly. The taffy vines retreat,
disappointed.
FELIX (CONT’D)
That’s not funny enough. Harder.
She hesitates.
CALHOUN
Look, you’re a nice guy, I can’t-FELIX
(unusually forceful)
No, ma’am! The arcade is depending
on us. Now do your duty, that’s an
order!
She full on belts him. The taffy howls with laughter. He’s
got a huge back eye.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Owwww! It’s working, hit me again!

WRECK-IT RALPH

60

CALHOUN
Ooh, your eye.
FELIX
I can fix it.
He hits his eye with the hammer. His black eye goes away.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Now go-- ow! San Frantastic.
WHAP! The vines howl. Felix smiles at her. He’s got teeth
missing. He hammers his teeth. BLING! His teeth reappear.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Again! Ow! You mean business! Ow!
Yikes on bikes!
She hits. BLING. He fixes his face. She hits. BLING. He fixes
his face. She hits. Bling. He fixes.
FELIX (CONT’D)
We’re... killing... them...
Finally, the vines are within reach. He grabs hold, then
pulls her into his arms.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Hold on tight, m’lady.
The vine sweeps them up and out of the quicksand. The world
slows down. Music swells. Calhoun looks up at Felix. For some
reason he looks strong-jawed and heroic. He smiles down on
her. Man, she’s beautiful. There’s a real chemistry between
them. They arrive on the tree branch.
Calhoun notices that the Laffy Taffy are singing in a Disneyesque choir and have formed a heart shape around them. She
pulls out her gun and shoots at the vines.
CALHOUN
Alright, enough with the goo-goo
eyes.
She looks at the sensor, all business.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
(climbing out of the tree)
Argh, we lost the cy-bug. Let’s go.
Come on, we’ll get a better view
from the air. Think you can fix
that shuttle?

WRECK-IT RALPH

Can do.

61
FELIX

He follows back her towards the shuttle.
Down below the tree, unbeknownst to them, something has
burrowed into the ground. We recognize the sounds of a cy-bug
coming from the hole it made.
We see a Cy Bug emerge from the hole. It eats a candy cane
and becomes striped.
CUT TO:
EXT. GO-KART BAKERY
An impressive facility shaped like a giant cake. Birthday
candle chimneys line the top. Ralph and Vanellope sneak past
a guard’s booth with BEARD PAPA snoozing inside of it.
EXT. BAKERY WALL — MOMENTS LATER
They slink up to a giant door with a hefty dead-bolt on it.
Vanellope’s face is painted huge on the door with a circleslash through it and the words: “No Glitches Allowed!”
VANELLOPE
Alright, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open.
RALPH
What’s this? You are a full on
criminal, aren’t you?
VANELLOPE
Hey, we shook on it.
SLAM CUT TO:
INT. KART BAKERY
Ralph’s fist busts through the door, destroying it.
VANELLOPE
Thank you, Jeeves.
Vanellope runs in. It’s dark. There’s nothing but a start
button.

WRECK-IT RALPH

62

RALPH
What is this place? Where are the
karts?
She hits the START BUTTON. A screen lights up. It reads:
CHOOSE YOUR KART. There are a bunch of cool candy karts to
choose from.
VANELLOPE
We gotta make one.
RALPH
What? No, no no. Look, kid, bad
idea, trust me. I don’t make
things, I break things.
VANELLOPE
Looks like you’ll be stepping
outside your comfort zone then,
Gladys.
(seeing a kart she likes)
Ooh, this is a good one.
She presses the “choose” button. Suddenly the entire place
lights up. There are levers and pulleys and bins.
GAME VOICE
Welcome to the BAKERY. Let’s bake a
kart.
RALPH
What is this, another game?
VANELLOPE
Yeah, well, it’s a mini game.
VOICE
You have one minute to win it.
What?

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Come on, Ralph!
Go!

VOICE

Oversized numbers fly through air from the background to the
foreground.
Vanellope runs over to giant steering wheel. Before her: two
shoots, a balancing platform, a bowl, and a trash can.

WRECK-IT RALPH

MIXING!

63
VOICE (CONT’D)

The word “MIXING” flies through the air and knocks Ralph on
the head.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Put the ingredients in the bowl and
throw away the trash.
Vanellope hangs on the wheel to steer it. Egg come out of the
shoot and onto the platform. She steers the wheel. The
platform tilts to drop the eggs in the batter bowl.
Other objects come out of the shoots like boots, soccer
balls, underpants, and hairbrushes.
A recipe card keeps score. Vanellope’s having trouble with
the steering and is missing the ingredients.
RALPH
Hair brush, no. Underpants. No, no!
(frustrated)
You’re getting it all wrong, kid!
VANELLOPE
I’m trying!
The clock reads: 45 seconds.
RALPH
Urgh. I’ll do it.
He jumps up on the platform, catches all the ingredients,
throws the good ones into the bowl and the bad ones all over
the floor.
RALPH (CONT’D)
No... yes... gross.. Milk, yes,
yes!
The flour hits him. He falls into the batter. The beaters
comes down and mix the batter, Ralph and all.
Batter up!

VOICE

The batter and Ralph dump into a mold. Ralph crawls out of
the batter just before it goes into the oven.
VANELLOPE
Come on, no sleeping on the job.

WRECK-IT RALPH

Baking!

64
VOICE

Ralph gets up, stumbles around, dizzy. The word “BAKING”
flies through the air and clocks him. UMPH.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Pump up the heat and hold the
perfect temperature.
Vanellope runs over and jumps on the bellows. She can’t get
it hot enough.
VANELLOPE
Ralph! A little help here.
I’m on it!

RALPH

Ralph jumps on it. He completely breaks the bellows.
Ralph!

VANELLOPE

RALPH
Yeah, no problem, just give me this
thing here-Ralph grabs the hose and blows into it himself. The mercury
rises.
VANELLOPE
Okay, good! A little more. That’s
it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
His cheeks are bulging. He turns red...then purple...then
blue.
DING! Vanellope cheers. Ralph collapses.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Yes! Come on, get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!
The door opens. The kart slides onto a conveyor belt.
VOICE
DECORATING!
Ralph manages to duck under the “DECORATING” word.
The conveyor belt goes under a bunch of candy dispensers
filled with everything from wheels to jimmies. They must

WRECK-IT RALPH

65

launch eggs off of a spatula aimed at targets on the
respective bins.
VANELLOPE
Wheels first.
How many?
FOUR, doi!
Got it.

RALPH
VANELLOPE
RALPH

Ralph hits the spatula four times hard. Four eggs launch, hit
the target and four wheels pop out of the bin.
VANELLOPE
Now frosting. A buttload of
frosting!
RALPH
No problem.
He hits the spatula several times. Several eggs go flying and
smash the entire bin, which dumps all of its frosting onto
the kart.
Then the entire bin tips, knocks the next bin. The bins
collapse like dominoes and dump all the ingredients down on
the kart.
Uh oh.

RALPH (CONT’D)

The final buzzer sounds.
The kart drops down a ramp into a fancy garage.
Times up.

VOICE

They run to the garage door, on which there’s a beautiful
image of a perfect kart. The garage door opens, revealing
their abomination beneath it.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Congratulations. You did it. And
here’s your kart!
Vanellope stares wide-eyed at the kart,.

WRECK-IT RALPH

66

RALPH
Aye yi yi. Look, kid...I tried to
warn you, I can’t make things, I
just break-I love it!
You do?

VANELLOPE
RALPH

VANELLOPE
I love it. I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!
Look, it’s got a real engine, and
look at these wheels.
(kisses the wheels)
I love it! I finally have a real
kart!
She hugs the kart. Ralph grins, pleased.
Vanellope then grabs two small pastry bags.
VANELLOPE(CONT’D)
Come on. A work of art like this
must be signed.
BACK OUTSIDE: Beard Papa wakes with a start.
He sees Vanellope on the security camera. Beard Papa GASPS.
He grabs his Red emergency phone.
BEARD PAPA
This is Beard Papa. The glitch is
in the bakery! Get me King Candy.
CUT TO:
BACK INSIDE THE BAKERY: Ralph and Vanellope finish putting
their names on the kart and stand back to admire their work.
Ralph’s smiling like a sap-- the first we’ve seen him smile.
VANELLOPE
Whoa. You have teeth? I’ve never
seen you smile before.
RALPH
I’m not smiling. I’m gassy, okay?
They start to crack up, when:
KING CANDY (O.S.)
Hold it right there, glitch!

WRECK-IT RALPH

67

King Candy, Wynnchel, and Duncan drive in. King Candy sees
Ralph and GASPS in shock!
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
(seeing Ralph)
And Wreck-it Ralph?!
Uh-oh.

RALPH

Ralph aims the pastry bag at King Candy and the donuts and
sprays them in the face, temporarily blinding them.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Start the kart!
Ralph throws Vanellope in the driver’s seat of her kart and
hops on the back.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Start the kart....
She fiddles with the buttons and knobs but nothing happens.
RALPH (CONT’D)
What are you waiting for?! C’mon,
let’s go?!
VANELLOPE
I... ah. I don’t know how to drive
a real kart.
RALPH
You don’t what?!
Duncan looks at King Candy, concerned.
DUNCAN
Are you hurt, Sire?
KING CANDY
No, he just glazed me! Get them!
Ralph pushes off the floor with his hands. The kart takes
off.
Gang way!

RALPH

WRECK-IT RALPH

68

EXT. BAKERY — CONTINUOUS
Ralph and Vanellope burst right through the wall. Ralph handpedals the ground faster. They catch a downhill and pick up
speed. King Candy and the donuts are hot on their trail.
KING CANDY
Stop in the name of the king,
that’s me!
VANELLOPE
Get off the road!
Ralph digs into the ground and takes a tight turn. The CLAW
swat truck over-shoots and goes tumbling.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!
They take a fork in the road.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Drive into the wall!
What?!

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Right there, between the two sugarfree lollipops!
RALPH
Are you crazy?!
VANELLOPE
Just do it!
Ralph aims the kart at the mountain head on! And just as we
brace for impact, Ralph, Vanellope, and the kart hit the
mountain wall, pixelate, and disappear.
INT. DIET COLA MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS
Ralph and Vanellope come sweeping into a Dali-esque world of
half-built game props. They CRASH. The kart ends up vertical
against a rock, front wheels spinning.
EXT. DIET COLA MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS
King Candy and the donut police screech to a halt. King Candy
removes his goggles and looks around.

WRECK-IT RALPH

69

KING CANDY
Where’d they go? Find that glitch.
Destroy that kart. She can’t be
allowed to race.
Wynnchel and Duncan drive off. King Candy wipes his sweaty
brow, upset.
INT. DIET COLA MOUNTAIN
Ralph picks himself up and lays into Vanellope.
RALPH
Let me get this straight; you don’t
know how to drive.
VANELLOPE
Well no, not technically. But I
just thought-Ralph gets to his feet.
RALPH
What did you think?!
(mocking voice)
Oh, I’ll just magically win the
race just because I really want to!
She grabs the steering wheel, eager.
VANELLOPE
Look wise guy, I know I’m a racer.
I can feel it in my code.
RALPH
That’s it, I’m never getting my
medal back.
Vanellope jumps up and tries to push the kart off the rock.
It doesn’t budge.
VANELLOPE
What is the big whoop about that
crummy medal anyway?
RALPH
The big whoop? Well this may come
as a shock to you, but in my game,
I’m the bad guy, and I live in the
garbage.
Cool.

VANELLOPE

WRECK-IT RALPH

70

RALPH
No, not cool. Unhygienic. And
lonely. And boring. But that
“crummy medal” was gonna change all
that. I go home with that baby
around my neck, and I’ll get a
penthouse. Pies. Ice sculptures.
Fireworks...
(off her blank stare)
...Ah, it’s grown up stuff. You
wouldn’t understand.
VANELLOPE
No, I get it. That’s exactly what
racing would do for me.
She goes back to trying to push the kart off the rock.
RALPH
Well, guess what?
What?

VANELLOPE

RALPH
News flash! Neither one of us is
getting what we want.
Ralph stomps his foot. BOOM! Something explodes nearby.
RALPH (CONT’D)
What was that?
Ralph follows the sound.
He comes to a room with a bubbling pool. He reads the signs.
RALPH (CONT’D)
(reading)
“Diet cola hot springs. Watch out
for falling Mentos?”
VANELLOPE
Yeah, check it out. Look!
Vanellope throws a rock at the stalactite. Hits it. A piece
of Mentos falls into the pool. BOOM! A giant broiling geyser
shoots up into the air.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Oh, you gotta watch out for the
splash. That stuff’s broiling hot.

WRECK-IT RALPH

71

RALPH
Yeah, I got that, thank you. What
is this dump?
VANELLOPE
I think it’s some sort of
unfinished bonus level. Yeah, it’s
pretty cool, huh? I found that
secret opening, and now I live
here. See, look, look look!
She runs over to a crudely fashioned lean-to above a bed of
candy-wrappers.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Welcome to my home! I sleep in
these candy wrappers. I bundle
myself up like a little homeless
lady...
Suddenly, it occurs to Ralph: their plights are the same.
RALPH
By yourself, with all this garbage
around you?
VANELLOPE
Well, yeah. I mean everyone here
says I’m just a mistake, and that I
wasn’t even supposed to exist. What
do you expect?
RALPH
Listen, kid... I know it’s none of
my business, but why do you even
stick around this game?
VANELLOPE
You really don’t know anything, do
you? Glitches can’t leave their
games. It’s one of the joys of
being me.
Ralph looks around at her sad life. He gets a thought. He
raises his giant fist and starts pounding the twisted,
nonsense architecture.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Hey! What are you doing?! Come on!
I know it’s a dump, but it’s all I
got!

WRECK-IT RALPH

72

RALPH
(still pounding)
If you’re going to be a racer, you
have to learn how to drive, and you
can’t do that without a track.
REVEAL: He’s made a beginner’s track around the hot springs.
Whoa.

VANELLOPE

Ralph picks up the kart and puts it on the track.
RALPH
Alright now, let’s hustle up. We
got some driving to do.
Vanellope runs in a circle around Ralph and the kart,
cheering.
VANELLOPE
I’m gonna learn to drive! I’m gonna
learn to drive! I’m gonna--Wait. Do
you know how to drive?
RALPH
Yeah! I mean, I haven’t done it,
but look, I flew a spaceship today,
okay?
VANELLOPE
You crashed it.
RALPH
Just get in. How hard can it be?
Okay, uh... start it up.
Vanellope starts it up and revs the engine.
RALPH (CONT'D)
There you go. Okay, now-VANELLOPE
There’s so much stuff in here!
RALPH
Don’t start touching anything yet.
Vanellope touches everything. She turns on the lights.
VANELLOPE
What’s this?

WRECK-IT RALPH

73

RALPH
Them’s the lights.
VANELLOPE
And what’s this?
She hits the horn, holds.
RALPH
That’s the horn. Yeah, that’s still
the horn.
VANELLOPE
I like the horn.
RALPH
Listen, we got work to do!
Okay!

VANELLOPE

She stops, focuses on him. He points to the pedals.
RALPH
So there’s some buttons on the
floor...
Pedals!

VANELLOPE

RALPH
Pedals. Right. Now, that’s the Go
pedal. That, I believe is the
stopper. And this.... Wait. What is
this?
(pressing the clutch)
It doesn’t do anything.
He picks up the kart, looks closely at the pedals, and starts
playing with them.
VANELLOPE
What does this joystick do?
She pushes the gear shift. The kart jumps forward, dragging
Ralph with it. He lands flat on his face.
AAOOWW!

RALPH

Vanellope stalls. Ralph lifts his head up.

WRECK-IT RALPH

74

RALPH (CONT’D)
Good. Let’s try that again.
JUMP CUT TO:
RALPH: standing in front of her.
She zips forward and slams into Ralph.
OUCH!

RALPH (CONT’D)
JUMP CUT TO:

RALPH: standing behind her.
She grinds the gears, flies in reverse, slams into him. He
cries out. She slams into him again.
JUMP CUT TO:
RALPH: hiding behind a rock.
Vanellope bucks forward, hits a tree. The tree falls, lands
on Ralph’s head.
JUMP CUT TO:
VANELLOPE: steering through an obstacle course. CUT to reveal
Ralph is pushing the kart from behind, guiding her around the
rocks.
JUMP CUT TO:
RALPH: motion-steering as Vanellope watches. She turns the
wheel and slams into a rock. Spitting out a tooth, she gives
a “thumbs up.”
JUMP CUT TO:
VANELLOPE: driving in first gear. She lifts her foot off the
clutch slowly and moves forward smoothly.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Hey, wait, you’re doing it.
She shifts again.
Oh, I am.

VANELLOPE

RALPH
Okay. Shift it again.

WRECK-IT RALPH

75

She makes it around the track. Shifts perfectly.
VANELLOPE
Whoa! I told you; racing’s in my
code!
She drives faster...and faster.
RALPH
Whoa, whoa whoa! Eyes on the wheel!
VANELLOPE
Hey Ralphie, watch this! I’m going
off road!
She jumps the track then drives right up a steep, natural
ramp. She jumps a part of broken track. Lands perfectly.
She makes another jump. Perfect.
RALPH
I got that medal in the bag.
She then aims for a giant jump...takes flight and....GLITCH!
Her kart glitches about in the air, out of control. She’s
headed right for the stalactite. She SCREAMS!
Look out!

RALPH (CONT’D)

She ducks, but her spoiler hits the Mentos. She glitches
again and crash lands on the track on the other side.
Giant chunks of Mentos fall into the hot springs. Geysers
shoot up. Ralph jumps out of the way of the boiling cola
falling around him.
Vanellope keeps spins out of control. She skids to a stop.
She looks spooked, but then she shakes it off.
VANELLOPE
So, how’d I do?
RALPH
Um... well, you almost blew up the
whole mountain.
VANELLOPE
Right, right, that’s a good note.
RALPH
You’ve got to get that glitch under
control, kid!

WRECK-IT RALPH

76

VANELLOPE
Okay, I will, I will! And then you
think I got a chance?
He contemplates.
...Tiny.

RALPH

She jumps up and around Ralph shouting-VANELLOPE
Yes! I’m gonna win! I’m gonna win!
I’m gonna win! I’m gonna win!
RALPH
(giving in to her
enthusiasm)
Top shelf.
Top shelf!

VANELLOPE

They fist bump.
CUT TO:
INT. KING CANDY’S CASTLE
King Candy paces in front of his kart throne. Sour Bill
follows, waving him with a fan lollipop.
The castle doors open. Wynnchel and Duncan approach.
KING CANDY
(urgent)
Did you find her? Tell me you found
her.
The donut cops shake their heads, no, solemnly.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
You didn’t? Go... leave me.
The donuts leave.
King Candy thinks, gets an idea, then storms off through the
door by his throne. Sour Bill hurries after him.

WRECK-IT RALPH

77

INT. “UNDERGROUND” CHAMBER
An elevator door opens and King Candy and Sour Bill step out
and walk along what looks like the insides of a wire.
King Candy approaches a large door, upon which rests a game
controller. He types in a cheat code. The door swings open.
King candy steps through it.
INT. THE GAME’S CODE
For the code savvy, it’s clearly a node graph. To the rest of
us it looks like an electric spider web of glowing threads
connecting an endless number of vault-like boxes.
KING CANDY
Oh the code, the sweet life blood
of the game.
The boxes are labelled with icons and text, saying everything
from: “GOBSTOPPER VALLEY” and “CHOCOLATE RIVER” to “TAFFYTA
MUTTONFUDGE” and “SOUR BILL.”
The physics are different here, and so King Candy floats as
if in zero gravity. He drifts amongst the web, cautiously.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
Where are you? Let’s see....
Stadium.... Jumbotron. There it is
the “Winner’s Cup.”
He double-clicks the box labeled “WINNER’S CUP.” The box
opens. Inside floats a bunch of smaller boxes labeled “Coin,”
interconnected with threads. Amongst the boxes, one stands
out. Its label says, “MEDAL.”
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
One of these things is not like the
others. You! We’re going to give
you a nice new home.
King Candy slides the Medal box out of the Winner’s Box and
along the network of threads. He arrives in front of a very
special box, connected with the most number of threads. It’s
labeled, “KING CANDY.” He double clicks it. It opens and he
slides the “Medal” box inside.
A string of ones and zeros gathers around his neck, then
solidifies into The Medal of Heroes.
Success.

KING CANDY (CONT’D)

WRECK-IT RALPH

78

He floats back towards the door. On his way he passes by a
box that is off alone, with no threads attached. It glitches.
Its label says: “VANELLOPE VON SCHWEETZ.”
KING CANDY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Sour Bill, I’m going out. You’re in
charge of the castle until I get
back.
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. SPACE POD
The cy-bug sensor is locked on the dash, scanning. There are
no bugs detected.
Calhoun pilots. Felix stares at her, blushing-unapologetically smitten.
CALHOUN
Your face is still red, you might
want to hit it with your hammer.
FELIX
Oh that’s not blunt force trauma,
ma’am. That’s just the honey glow
in my cheeks.
Oh.

CALHOUN

FELIX
Ma’am, I just gotta tell
you...You’re one dynamite gal.
Calhoun reacts.
FLASHBACK: Calhoun at the gun range, letting out a round.
BRAD in the cubicle next to her, turns, impressed.
BRAD
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.
FLASHBACK: Calhoun and Brad, sharing a Sunday.
BRAD (CONT’D)
One dynamite gal.
FLASHBACK: Calhoun and Brad having a flowery picnic.
BRAD (CONT’D)
Dynamite gal.

FLASHBACK: Brad on one knee proposing.
BRAD (CONT’D)
Dynamite gal.
FLASHBACK: Calhoun and Brad’s wedding.
BRAD (CONT’D)
Dynamite gal.
The glass shatters as the bug bursts in.
SLAM CUT TO:
INT. SHIP — DAY, BACK TO PRESENT
Calhoun snaps back to reality, upset, almost livid. She banks
the ship hard to the right. Felix goes tumbling.
She lands the ship in the woods by the castle.
Get out!

CALHOUN

FELIX
All I said is you’re a dynamite
gal!
CALHOUN
I said GET OUT!
He climbs out. Turns to say something else, but the glass
comes down immediately and the ship lifts off.
FELIX
(distraught)
Jimminy jamminy...
He lumbers off towards the castle.
CUT TO:
EXT. KING CANDY’S CASTLE DOOR — SHORT TIME LATER
Felix knocks on the castle door. Sour Bill opens the door.
Mmmmyes?

SOUR BILL

WRECK-IT RALPH

80

FELIX
I’m Fix-it Felix, Jr, sir, from the
game Fix-it Felix Jr. Have you seen
my friend, Ralph?
SOUR BILL
Wreck-it Ralph?
FELIX
Yes, yes, that’s him.
SOUR BILL
Shoulda locked him up when we had
the chance.
FELIX
Locked him up?
Sour Bill grabs a handle and pulls. A trap door opens and
Felix falls in.
SOUR BILL
Not making the same mistake with
you.
FELIX
(falling)
Oh my land!
CUT TO:
EXT. DIET SODA MOUNTAIN
Vanellope comes running out of the secret door. Ralph pushes
the kart out behind her.
VANELLOPE
Come on Ralph! This is it. This is
really happening. I almost don’t
believe it. I mean, I have dreamt
about it for so long, and now...now
I think I’m gonna puke, actually. I
mean I think I might puke. You
know, like a verp?
A what?

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Vomit and a burp together, and you
can taste it, and it’s just like
rising up.... Oh this is so
exciting!

WRECK-IT RALPH

81

RALPH
Yes! It is. It’s exciting!
VANELLOPE
I mean, am I ready to be a real
racer? Ralph, what if the gamers
don’t like me?!
RALPH
Who doesn’t love a brat with dirty
hair? Come on, those people are
gonna love you. You know why?
Because you’re a winner.
VANELLOPE
I’m a winner.
RALPH
And you’re adorable.
VANELLOPE
I’m adorable.
RALPH
And everyone loves an adorable
winner!
Yeah!

VANELLOPE

RALPH
Okay. Come on.
She laughs and hops in her kart. Ralph climbs on the back.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Listen to me: if you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself: “I must
win Ralph’s medal or his life will
be ruined.” And have fun. Got it?
Got it.

VANELLOPE

Vanellope starts driving away, then slams on the brakes.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Wait. Hold on!
Ralph FALLS forward. She puts it in reverse, then stops
short. He FALLS off the back.
RALPH
Where are you going?

WRECK-IT RALPH

82

VANELLOPE
I forgot something. I’ll be right
back.
Vanellope runs back into the mountain. Ralph watches after
her.
RALPH
Huh. kids...!
He sighs, content. We hear the sound of a kart engine.
KING CANDY (O.S.)
Ralph, there you are! Hello!
Ralph turns to see King Candy getting out of his kart.
You!

RALPH

KING CANDY
Now, I came alone. Unarmed. Whoa-He ducks as a boulder flies past his head.
RALPH
I’ve had enough of you, Pillow
Pants.
Ralph chases King Candy around a giant gum drop.
KING CANDY
Now, calm down! Calm down!
RALPH
I’m gonna beat the filling out of
you!
KING CANDY
(putting on giant glasses)
You wouldn’t hit a guy with
glasses, would you?
Ralph grabs the glasses off of his face and knocks King Candy
on the head with them.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
Oh you hit a guy WITH glasses, well
played.
Ralph grabs him by the lapels.
RALPH
What do you want, Candy?

WRECK-IT RALPH

83

KING CANDY
For you to close your mouth. Your
breath... Listen, I just want to
talk to you.
RALPH
I’m not interested in anything you
have to say.
KING CANDY
How about this? Are you interested
in this?
King Candy holds up the Medal of Heroes. Shocked to see it,
Ralph drops King Candy.
RALPH
My medal. How did you-KING CANDY
It doesn’t matter. It’s yours....
Go ahead. Take it.
Ralph takes the medal.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
All I ask is that you hear me out.
Ralph stares at the medal as he considers.
RALPH
...About what?
KING CANDY
Ralph, do you know what the hardest
part about being a King is? Doing
what’s right, no matter what.
RALPH
Get to the point.
KING CANDY
Point being, I need your help. Sad
as it is, Vanellope cannot be
allowed to race.
RALPH
Why are you people so against her?
KING CANDY
I’m not against her. I’m trying to
protect her.

WRECK-IT RALPH

84

KING CANDY (CONT’D)
If Vanellope wins that race, she’ll
be added to the Race Roster.
We close in on King Candy’s eye and into his mind, where we
see Vanellope pop up as one of the nine daily avatars.
A gamer selects Vanellope.
KING CANDY (V.O.)
Then gamers can choose her as their
avatar. And when they see her
glitching and twitching and just
being herself...
FLASH FORWARD: Vanellope glitching all over the track.
KING CANDY (V.O.)(CONT’D)
...they’ll think our game is
broken. We’ll be put out of order,
for good.
FLASH FORWARD: The Out-of-Order gets slapped onto the Sugar
Rush console.
King Candy’s subjects rush into Game Central.
KING CANDY(V.O.)(CONT’D)
All my subjects will be homeless.
But there’s one who cannot escape,
because she’s a glitch.
FLASH FORWARD: A scared Vanellope is sucked into the vortex
of un-plugged oblivion.
VANELLOPE
Help! Somebody help!
KING CANDY (V.O)
And when the game’s plug is pulled,
she’ll die with it.
We pull out of the FLASH FORWARD through Ralph’s eyes. He’s
horrified by the thought.
RALPH
You don’t know that’ll happen. The
gamers could love her.
KING CANDY
And if they don’t?
Ralph sits down, eyes still on his medal.

WRECK-IT RALPH

85

KING CANDY (CONT’D)
I know it’s tough. But heroes have
to make the tough choices, don’t
they? She can’t race, Ralph. But
she won’t listen to me. So, can I
count on you to talk a little sense
into her?
Ralph contemplates, then gives a small, pained nod.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
Very good.... Now, I’ll give you
two some time alone.
King Candy disappears around the bend. Ralph stares at the
medal. He hears Vanellope returning. He stands, braces
himself, and puts the medal in his pocket.
VANELLOPE
I’m back. Did you miss me?
RALPH
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, can we talk for a
second?
VANELLOPE
Wait. First, kneel down.
RALPH
What? No, no, we really-VANELLOPE
Will ya just do it!
Ok.

RALPH

He kneels down.
VANELLOPE
Now close your eyes.
Vanellope.

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Shush. Close ‘em!
He shuts them. She ties something around his neck.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Okay. Open ‘em up!

WRECK-IT RALPH

86

He looks down and sees a small, handmade candy heart on a
string, on which is hand-painted the words: “To Stink Brain.”
RALPH
(reading)
To Stink Brain. Gee, thanks.
VANELLOPE
Turn it over.
He does. On the back is painted the words: “You’re my Hero.”
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
I made it for you, just in case we
don’t win. Not that I think there’s
even a remote chance we’re not
gonna win.
RALPH
(this is killing him)
Thanks kid, Um listen-VANELLOPE
Now rise, my royal chump! I’ve got
a date with destiny!
(Ralph doesn’t move)
Ralph, come on, move your molasses!
RALPH
Um, I’ve been thinking-VANELLOPE
That’s dangerous.
RALPH
Who cares about this stupid race,
anyway?
VANELLOPE
That’s not very funny, Ralph.
RALPH
No, I’m serious. It was really fun
to build the kart and everything
but maybe you shouldn’t do it.
That gets her attention.
VANELLOPE
Ah, hello? Is Ralph in there? I’d
like to speak to him please.

WRECK-IT RALPH

87

RALPH
Look, what I’m saying is, you can’t
be a racer.
Her eyes go down to his chest and she sees something.
VANELLOPE
What? Why would you-She pulls the Medal of Heroes out of Ralph’s pocket.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Wait a minute. Where did you get
this?
RALPH
Look, I’m gonna be straight with
you; I’ve been talking to King
Candy.
VANELLOPE
King Candy? You sold me out?
RALPH
You don’t understand.
VANELLOPE
No, I understand plenty, traitor.
She throws the medal at him. It hits him in the face and
falls to the ground. She jumps back in the kart.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
You’re a rat. And I don’t need you!
I can win that race on my own.
RALPH
But I’m trying to save your skin,
kid!
Ralph grabs her and picks her up out of the kart.
VANELLOPE
Hey! Put me down. Let me go!
He sets her down. She immediately makes a dash for the kart.
Ralph blocks her way. She struggles to get around him.
RALPH
No, you listen to me. You know
what’s gonna happen when the
players see you glitching? They’re
gonna think the game’s broken.

WRECK-IT RALPH

88

VANELLOPE
I don’t care, you’re a liar.
RALPH
You better care, because if your
game goes out of order, you go down
with the ship, little sister!
VANELLOPE
I’m not listening to you! Get out
of my way!
She gets under his leg and gets back in the kart.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
I’m going to that race!
He pulls her out again and holds her by the scruff. She
thrashes and kicks at him.
RALPH
No, you’re not.
He hangs her by her hood on the edge of a pointy gumdrop.
VANELLOPE
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!
RALPH
No.... I’m doing this for your own
good.
He goes over to the kart and raises his fists. She struggles
to get free, but can’t.
VANELLOPE
Wait. Wait. Wait. No. No. No.
Please, Ralph! No! Stop!
But he doesn’t stop. He destroys the kart.
She sobs. Then she glitches and lands on her butt on the
ground.
The kart is in ruins. Ralph turns to her.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
(heartbroken)
You really are a bad guy.
She runs sobbing into the mountain entrance. Ralph hangs his
head. He sighs, then walks over and picks up his medal.

WRECK-IT RALPH

89

He starts down the road alone.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. FIX-IT FELIX, JR.
Ralph rides up on the push cart, wearing his medal. It’s
awfully quiet. All the lights are out at the Niceland
Apartments, but for a single light in the Penthouse.
CUT TO:
INT. PENTHOUSE
The door hangs slightly open. Ralph pushes it the rest of the
way and steps inside. The place looks like it’s been looted.
RALPH
Hello? Anybody home? Felix? Mary?
GENE (O.S.)
Well, you actually went and did it.
There, by the bar, stands Gene, pouring one last Martini.
RALPH
Gene? Where is everybody?
GENE
They’re gone. After Felix went to
find you and then didn’t come back,
everyone panicked and abandoned
ship.
RALPH
But--but I’m here now.
GENE
It’s too late, Ralph. Litwak’s
pulling our plug in the morning.
Gene motions towards the balcony. Ralph goes over and looks
out. He sees the Out-of-Order sign taped to the console.
GENE (CONT’D)
But, never let it be said I’m not a
man of my word. The place is yours,
Ralph. Enjoy.
Gene tosses Ralph the keys to the Penthouse. Ralph catches
them and looks at them, upset, as Gene grabs his suitcase and
heads for the door.

WRECK-IT RALPH

RALPH
Gene, wait. Listen, this is not
what I wanted.
Gene stops and turns back.
GENE
So what did you want Ralph?
RALPH
I don’t know, I just.... I was just
tired of living alone in the
garbage.
GENE
Well now you can live alone in the
penthouse.
Gene leaves.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PENTHOUSE BALCONY — SHORT TIME LATER
Ralph stands there, alone. He looks down at the Medal of
Heroes. He shakes his head, disgusted, then throws it.
The medal smacks against the game screen. The hit on the
screen causes one corner of the tape on the Out-of-Order sign
to release. The sign goes crooked.
He looks out the game screen and sees the Sugar Rush console
across the way. It reminds him of the homemade medal
Vanellope gave him. It’s still around his neck. He takes it
off and turns it to the side that says, “You’re my Hero.”
He hugs it to his chest and looks back out at the Sugar Rush
game. He notices something...
There on the console’s side, are illustrations of all the
racers, including Vanellope.
BACK ON RALPH: That makes him think...then run off.
CUT TO:
INT. SUGAR RUSH, THE BASE OF DIET COLA MOUNTAIN
Sour Bill loads the scraps of Vanellope’s kart into a candy
wheelbarrow. A shadow rises over him.

Hey cough drop. Explain something
to me...
Sour Bill turns to see Ralph, looming, fists on hips.
RALPH (CONT’D)
If Vanellope was never meant to
exist, then why is HER picture on
the side of the game console?

Uuhhhhhh...
Sour Bill makes a run for it. Ralph grabs him.

What’s going on in this candycoated Heart of Darkness?
Nothin’.

I’ll lick you.
SOUR BILL
You wouldn’t.
Oh yeah?

Ralph gives him a quick lick. Sour Bill cringes.
SOUR BILL
That’s like sandpaper.
RALPH
Hmm, wonder how many licks it’ll
take to get to your center.

I’ll take it to my grave.

Fair enough.
Ralph tosses Sour Bill in his mouth.

RALPH (CONT’D)
(puckering)
Ooh-hoo-hoo. They call you Sour
Bill for a reason.
Sour Bill SCREAMS as Ralph swishes him around. Finally, Ralph
pulls him out.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Had enough yet?
Sour Bill squeals like stoolie.
SOUR BILL
Okay, I’ll talk. I’ll talk. I’ll
talk. Vanellope WAS a racer until
King Candy tried to delete her codeAs Sour Bill spills the beans...
FLASHBACK: King Candy in the code room, tearing all the
connections off of Vanellope’s code.
RALPH (O.S.)
Tried to delete her code? So that’s
why she’s a glitch!
BACK ON RALPH: shocked.
Uh-huh.

SOUR BILL

RALPH
Why is he doing this to her?
SOUR BILL
I don’t know.
RALPH
Suit yourself.
Ralph threatens to eat him again. Sour Bill throws his arms
up.
SOUR BILL
No no no, I swear, I don’t know!
FLASHBACK: We see King Candy floating through the code room,
scooping up nodes of memory into a royal chest. He locks the
chest with a pad lock.

WRECK-IT RALPH

93

SOUR BILL (CONT’D)
He literally locked up our
memories. And I cannot remember.
Nobody can.
BACK ON SOUR BILL: Arms still up, praying he won’t be eaten.
SOUR BILL (CONT'D)
But I do know this. He’ll do
anything to keep her from racing,
because if she crosses the finish
line, the game will reset and she
won’t be a glitch anymore.
RALPH
Where is she now?!
SOUR BILL
In the Fungeon with Fix-it Felix.
Felix?

RALPH

SOUR BILL
And that’s all I know. I swear. Now
please don’t put me back in your
filthy mouth again.
Ralph licks Sour Bill, then sticks him to a tree.
RALPH
Stick around.
SOUR BILL
Yes okay, I will, I will, thank
you.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUGAR RUSH, LICORICE FIELD
Calhoun patrols the area. Her scanner goes off. She pulls out
her gun and follows the beep.
CALHOUN
Come on, I know you’re out there.
The signal suddenly drops out. She hits the tri-quarter,
frustrated.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Ugh. Saccharine-saturated
nightmare.

WRECK-IT RALPH

94

The tri-quarter suddenly goes off, loudly. She looks around
on alert.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
But-- where...
The ground gives way and she tumbles into...
A GIANT CAVERN: She grabs licorice roots to keep from falling
into the nest below, full of hatching cy-bug eggs and candycoated cy-bugs traveling in and out of long caverns.
CALHOUN (CONT’D)
(to herself)
Doomsday and Armageddon just had a
baby and it is ugly.
CUT TO:
THE TIME CLOCK IN THE SKY: The arcade opens in less than an
hour. We pull back and through a barred window into...
INT. FELIX’S CELL, KING CANDY’S FUNGEON
A frustrated Felix calls out the dungeon window.
FELIX
Hello! Somebody?! Anybody! Please
let me out!
He shakes the bars. One bar is loose.
FELIX (CONT’D)
What’s he say? How does he say it?
(imitating Ralph)
I’m gonna wreck it.
He hits the bars with his hammer. They fortify, stronger.
FELIX (CONT’D)
Oh why do I fix everything I
touch?!
Suddenly, Ralph bursts through the wall.
Felix!

RALPH

FELIX
Ralph! I’m so glad to see you.
Felix throws his arms around Ralph. Changing his mind, he
lets go and turns away from him.

WRECK-IT RALPH

95

FELIX (CONT’D)
Wait. No I’m not. What do you have
to say for yourself? Wait, I don’t
want to hear it. I’m not talking to
you.
RALPH
Ok, don’t talk, that’s fine. But
you have to fix this go-kart for
me, pronto.
FELIX
I don’t have to do boo...forgive my
potty mouth. I’m just so, so, cross
with you. Do you have any idea what
you’ve put me through? I ran
higgledy-piggledy all over creation
looking for you. I almost drowned
in chocolate milk mix. And then I
met the most dynamite gal. She just
gives me the honey-glow something
awful. But she rebuffed my
affections. And then I got thrown
in jail.
RALPH
Felix, pull yourself together.
FELIX
No Ralph, you don’t know what it’s
like to be rejected and treated
like a criminal!
RALPH
Yes, I do. That’s everyday of my
life.
It is?

FELIX

RALPH
Which is why I ran off. And I tried
to be a good guy. But I’m not. I’m
just a bad guy. And I need your
help. There’s a little girl whose
only hope is this kart. Please,
Felix, fix it and I promise I will
never try to be good again.
Felix can’t help but be moved.

WRECK-IT RALPH

96

INT. VANELLOPE’S CELL
Vanellope sits in a fungeon fortress. The door looks
unbreakable. Silly pictures and games line the walls.
Vanellope sits in the middle of the room with a “Glitch
proof” collar and chains around her waist. BAM! Ralph busts
the door down and pushes in her fixed kart.
RALPH
I know, I know, I know. I’m an
idiot.
And...?

VANELLOPE

RALPH
And a real numbskull.
And...?

VANELLOPE

RALPH
A selfish diaper baby.
And...?

VANELLOPE

RALPH
A...Stink brain?
VANELLOPE
The stinkiest brain ever.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUGAR RUSH RACE ARENA
Giant soda bottles pop and spray. The lids of the fan boxes
fly off, revealing hundreds of spectators. The racers line up
at the start. A blimp flies over head. King Candy stands in
his royal box.
KING CANDY
My sweet subjects, I can without a
pinch of hesitation assure you that
I have never been so happy in all
my life to say the following words:
Let the Random Roster Race
commence!
Cheers! King Candy slides down his royal banner. He lands in
his own kart. A MARSHMALLOW waves the checkered flag. And
they’re off!

WRECK-IT RALPH

97

BEHIND THE STANDS: Ralph and Felix ride on the back of
Vanellope’s kart, holding on for dear life, as she drives.
RALPH
Remember, you don’t have to win!
Just cross that finish line, and
you’ll be a real racer.
As they enter the arena, Ralph and Felix jump off the kart.
VANELLOPE
I’m already a real racer, and I’m
gonna win!
Vanellope speeds across the starting line. She’s in the race!
OUT ON THE TRACK: The racers enter GUM BALL PASS and must
dodge gum balls the size of bowling balls.
Adorabeezle Winterpop hits a Power-Up. Her kart transforms to
reveals an ice cream cannon.
Power up!

ANNOUNCER

She shoots a scoop of ice cream, hitting Jubileena square in
the face.
ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
Oh, Ala Mode!
King Candy hits a Power-Up. The hood of his kart opens and
unleashes a canon. He fires three fireballs at Rancis and
Minty, knocking them out of his way.
KING CANDY
Have some candy!
Red hots!

ANNOUNCER

Further back on the track, Vanellope passes Minty Zaki.
Vanellope!

MINTY ZAKI

Vanellope then catches up to Taffyta.
VANELLOPE
Pardon me. Excuse me. Hot soup!
Coming through! Lady with a baby!
RANCIS
It’s the glitch, it’s the glitch!

WRECK-IT RALPH

98

TAFFYTA
The glitch?!
Taffyta pulls ahead and up the layer cake, lined with giant
cherries. She passes Candlehead.
TAFFYTA (CONT'D)
(to Candlehead)
Light ‘em up, Candlehead!
Candlehead leans over and lights the cherry stems with the
flame on her helmet. They turn into cherry bombs that blast
as Vanellope glitches passes them.
ANNOUNCER
What’s this? Cherry bombs!
Taffyta hits a Power-Up. Sprinkle spikes shoot out the back
of her kart and hit Vanellope.
TAFFTYA
Stay sweet, glitch!
Vanellope glitches all over the place, out of control.
ANNOUNCER
Oh, Taffy-Whacked!
IN THE ARENA: Ralph and Felix watch, aghast.
FELIX
Oh no, she’s glitching!
RALPH
Come on, kid. Get it under control.
BACK ON THE TRACK:
Tafftya, Candlehead, and Rancis shoot into a giant straw.
Vanellope glitches up the rear.
TAFFTYA
I told you. You’re just an accident
waiting to happen!
She suddenly glitches between the karts and ends up in front,
driving straight.
Shocked, the racers lose control and spin out, just as the
tunnel spits them out over the sea.
Vanellope lands hard on the ramp on the far shore, stunned
and confused.

WRECK-IT RALPH

99

The rest of the racers miss and crash into giant cupcakes.
TAFFYTA
(spitting out frosting)
Waaaaaaaaa.
CANDLEHEAD
I’m a burnout!
VANELLOPE
(to herself)
Keep it under control, Vanellope.
No more glitching.
IN THE ARENA: Ralph and Felix cheer.
RALPH
Okay, kid, let’s finish this thing
without any more surprises--UMPH!
Ralph is punched in the face.
CALHOUN
Hope you’re happy, junk pile.
This game is going down, and it’s
all your fault.
FELIX
My lady? You came back.
CALHOUN
Can it, Fix-it.
(back to Ralph)
That cy-bug you brought with you,
multiplied.
RALPH
No, it died in the taffy swamp.
The earth shakes. Cracks. Cy-bugs burst out of the ground.
CALHOUN
Bull. Roar.
Ralph gasps in shock.
BACK ON THE TRACK: Vanellope catches King Candy, passes him.
She takes the lead.
BACK IN THE ARENA: Calhoun holds off bugs and ushers the
crowd out of the stands.

WRECK-IT RALPH

100

CALHOUN (CONT’D)
Listen up! Head to Game Central
Station now. Move it, let’s go, go,
go!
The spectators scream and hotfoot it out of the stands.
Ralph sees Cy-bugs swarming the finish line, attracted to the
neon glow “FINISH.”
What?

No!

RALPH

He runs over and starts punching them.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Get away. Shoo! Go on, go back to
your game!
ENTRANCE TO THE NOUGAT MINES: Vanellope enters the mines.
King Candy takes a short cut.
INSIDE THE NOUGAT MINES: King Candy sweeps in and rear-ends
her so hard that she spins out. He hits her again and her
front end goes up on his hood. She tries to shift and get off
of his hood.
KING CANDY
Get off this track!
King Candy stands up, breaks the antenna off of his kart, and
whacks at her. She screams.
KING CANDY (CONT’D)
I forbid you to cross that finish
line!
BACK AT THE FINISH LINE: Felix and Ralph continue fighting
off bugs. Felix points to the jumbotron.
FELIX
Ralph, look!

Kid!

RALPH
(seeing Vanellope in
danger)

BACK IN THE MINES:
She and King Candy wrestle with the antenna. She glitches
nervously, causing King Candy to glitch, too.

WRECK-IT RALPH

101

KING CANDY
No, no! I’m not letting you undo
all my hard work!
Vanellope grabs King Candy’s antenna and WRESTLES with him.
BACK IN THE ARENA: Felix and Ralph see it on the Jumbotron.
FELIX
Is that...?
RALPH
No, it can’t be.
ON JUMBOTRON: The more King Candy glitches, the more we lose
sight of him and get flashes of a creepy, familiar face.
TURBO!

RALPH AND FELIX

BACK IN THE MINES: Vanellope screams in shock.
VANELLOPE
What? Who are you?!
KING CANDY
I’m Turbo! I’m the greatest racer
in this arcade! And I didn’t escape
Roadblasters, learn code, and
reprogram this game to let you and
your obese warthog of a friend take
it away from me!
He aims for a wall separating a fork in the road. He’s going
to ram her right into it.
No! Stop!

VANELLOPE

The wall gets closer. King Candy laughs.
KING CANDY
End of the line, glitch.
VANELLOPE
...Glitch.... That’s it.
That gives her an idea. The world seems to slow down as she
concentrates.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Come on. You can do it.
Concentrate. And... Glitch!

WRECK-IT RALPH

102

She glitches. Disappears. Reappears to the left of the wall.
King Candy swerves, bounces off the wall, and heads down the
right hand tunnel.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did
it!
Vanellope speeds off and out of the mines. King Candy, on the
other hand, speeds right into the open mouth of a cy-bug!
BACK AT THE FINISH LINE: Ralph sees her coming. He and Felix
have a path cleared for her.
FELIX
There she is, Ralph!
RALPH
Bring it home, kid! The finish
line’s wide open!
BOOM! Cy-bugs start bursting out of the ground on the track.
Vanellope screams and swerves around them, aiming for the
finish line.
But a cy-bug bursts out right in front of her. She crashes
into it and goes flying.
No!

RALPH (CONT’D)

Ralph and Felix leave the finish line and run to her.
Ralph scoops her up out of candy debris.
RALPH (CONT’D)
Kid, are you okay?
VANELLOPE
I’m fine, I’m fine. Let’s finish
this race!
FELIX (O.S.)
Ralph, look!
Ralph turns to see that finish line is completely over-run by
bugs. It collapses.
FELIX (CONT’D)
I can’t fix that.
Let’s go.

RALPH

WRECK-IT RALPH

103

VANELLOPE
But I didn’t cross the finish line!
RALPH
There is no finish line.
They run out of the arena.
ON THE RAINBOW: Calhoun shoots bugs.
CALHOUN
Everybody out! Now, now, now!
Ralph and Vanellope come running up the rainbow.
VANELLOPE
Ralph, it’s not gonna work.
RALPH
We gotta try.
Ralph runs through the exit with Vanellope on his shoulders,
but she’s ripped back into the game.
No!

RALPH (CONT’D)

VANELLOPE
Ralph, I told you, I can’t leave
the game.
He tries to push her through, but she can’t leave.
RALPH
Come on, get through, it’s got to
work.
VANELLOPE
Ouch. Stop. It’s no use.
Felix joins Calhoun as the last of the citizens leaves.
CALHOUN
That’s everyone. Now we’ve got to
blow up this exit.
VANELLOPE
Just go without me.
RALPH
No, I’m not leaving you here alone.
Ralph and Vanellope look out at the destruction around them.

WRECK-IT RALPH

104

FELIX
But what about this game?
CALHOUN
There’s nothing we can do. Without
a beacon, there’s no way to stop
these monsters.
Ralph looks up at Diet Cola Mountain.
RALPH
A beacon?
(to Vanellope)
Stay with Felix.
He jumps onto Calhoun’s cruiser. Wobbles. Steadies himself.
RALPH (CONT’D)
(to Calhoun)
Let me borrow that, lady.
FELIX
Ralph, where are you going?
RALPH
What I do best; I’m gonna wreck it!
Calhoun steps ahead of Felix and Vanellope and shoots at the
advancing bugs.
CALHOUN
Fix-it, get behind me!
Ralph flies off, through the air, most ungracefully. Bugs
attack. He punches them out of his way, sways, almost falls.
Ralph reaches the top of Diet Cola Mountain and jumps off the
hover board. The crater’s center is like petrified Mentos
(think Giant’s Causeway). Ralph punches it with all of his
might. RUMBLE.
INSIDE VANELLOPE’S LAIR: Small pieces break off the giant
stalactite and land in the hot cola beneath. Bright glowing
geysers shoot up all around.
BACK ON THE CRATER: Ralph gives it all he’s got. The crater
cracks all around. He prepares for a final blow.
One more!

RALPH

SLAM! Ralph is knocked aside by what we assume is a cy-bug.
He slams hard into the rim of the mountain. He shakes it off,
as we hear a familiar sinister LAUGH.

WRECK-IT RALPH

105

Ralph looks up to see he is face-to-face with a giant,
monstrous King Candy Turbo Cy-bug mash up.
Uh-oh.

RALPH (CONT’D)

KC TURBO BUG
Hello, old friend. Like what you
see? Be honest.... Because of you,
I’m now the most powerful virus in
the arcade. I can take over any
game I want. I should thank you,
but it’d be more fun to kill you.
Turbo lunges at him.
KC TURBO BUG (CONT’D)
Have some candy.
Ralph gets past him. Turbo grabs him, throws him back again.
Ralph gets to his feet and dives for the crater.
KC TURBO BUG (CONT’D)
Get back here little guy.
Turbo catches him by his feet and flies him way up into the
air.
Up we go.
No!

KC TURBO BUG (CONT’D)
RALPH

BACK AT THE RAINBOW: Calhoun struggles to fight off the cybugs as they swarm the exit. Felix pushes Vanellope behind
him protectively.
Ralph!

VANELLOPE

Calhoun runs out of Ammunition. She resorts to swatting away
bugs with the butt of her gun, but they close in.
Fall back!

CALHOUN

She and Felix fall back through the exit. Vanellope stands
before the bugs, alone.
BACK IN THE AIR: Ralph sees the bugs closing in on Vanellope.

WRECK-IT RALPH

Vanellope!

106
RALPH

KC TURBO BUG
Look at that. Your little friend is
doomed. Let’s watch her die
together, shall we?
No!

RALPH

Turbo flips Ralph around and catches him by his collar.
KC TURBO BUG
Guess, it’s game over for both of
you.
Ralph looks down at Vanellope, then looks to his goal, the
volcano now so very far below him.
RALPH
(determined)
No. Just for me.
Ralph breaks free from Turbo’s grasp.
BACK ON THE RAINBOW: Vanellope sees Ralph falling from such a
great height.
Ralph!

VANELLOPE

A bug closes in on her. She glitches and lands on top of the
cy-bug. Glitches again and lands on top of another one,
heading towards the mountain.
Vanellope!

FELIX

BACK IN THE AIR: Ralph recites the Bad Guy Affirmation on his
way down.
RALPH
I’m bad, and that’s good. I will
never be good, and that’s not bad.
Vanellope’s medal slips out of his shirt. He grabs onto it
and hugs it to his chest.
RALPH (CONT'D)
There’s no one I’d rather be than
me.

WRECK-IT RALPH

107

He slams his fists down on the volcano’s Mentos crater. It
cracks all around.
IN DIET-COLA MOUNTAIN: The stalactite falls towards the
broiling hot diet cola. Ralph falls with it. This is it.
Suddenly, Vanellope rides up the side ramp in a kart. She
makes the big jump and catches Ralph on the hood of her kart.
Kid?

RALPH (CONT’D)

VANELLOPE
Don’t worry, I got it under
control!
She bounces off the stalactite, and glitches through the
other side of the mountain, just as the mountain erupts.
The cy-bugs instinctively stop fighting. They turn and fly
towards the geyser's bright light. ZAP! ZAP! ZAP!
Up in the air, Turbo looks around at the other bugs.
KC TURBO BUG
You fools! Why are you going into
the light-Turbo looks at the light and his eyes suddenly bulge like an
entranced cy-bug. He flies towards the light.
KC TURBO BUG (CONT’D)
No, no.
(laughs)
I must go into the light!
He flies right into the light and is zapped.
Ralph and Vanellope crash land in the chocolate river, safe.
RALPH
(laughs)
Chocolate? I love chocolate.
Felix and Calhoun see it all from the rainbow.
FELIX
You did it, Ralph! You did it,
brother!
He laughs for joy. Felix hops up and gives Calhoun an 8-bitkiss on her cheek. A little ten-point heart rises up. She
looks at him like she’s going to kill him. Yanks him up by

WRECK-IT RALPH

108

his collars and slams her lips on his. It’s worth ten
thousand points.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SUGAR RUSH RACE ARENA
Felix puts the finishing touches on the finish line.
All fixed!

FELIX

Ralph puts Vanellope into her own, dented kart.
RALPH
You ready for this?
VANELLOPE
As ready as I’ll ever be.
Ralph gives Vanellope a push. She rolls across the line.
Sparkles flicker everywhere.
INT. CODE ROOM: The threads flicker. Vanellope’s lonely box
is suddenly attached to the giant web by dozens of threads.
EXT. SUGAR RUSH LANDSCAPE: The landscape resets back to all
its beauty.
THE POWER CORD ENTRANCE: The citizens of Sugar Rush flood
back into the game in amazement.
BACK ON THE TRACK: Vanellope rises up out of her kart, into
the air, and twirls.
VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
Whoa. What’s with all the magic
sparkles?
A beautiful princess dress forms on her body. A crown appears
on her head, a wand in her hand.
IN THE CODE ROOM: The memory box unlocks and strings of
memory pour out of it.
BACK ON THE TRACK: Vanellope’s eyes widen as her memory comes
rushing back.
The faces of her citizens brighten as they remember, too.
Sour Bill returns, a candy tree limb stuck to his back.

WRECK-IT RALPH

109

SOUR BILL
(kneeling down)
Now I remember. All hail the
Rightful Ruler of Sugar Rush:
Princess Vanellope.
The kids look to each other in panic; the horrible way they
treated her coming back to haunt them.
TAFFYTA
(cool-headed)
Hey Vanellope, you know all that
stuff we said earlier, that was all
a joke, you know that, right?
VANELLOPE
(a voice like Snow White)
Tut-tut. As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree that everyone who
was ever mean to me shall
be...executed.
RACERS
What?! No, please!
They cry. They wail. Felix and Calhoun share a look -- this
is getting creepy.
FELIX
Oh my land!
CALHOUN
This place just got interesting.
VANELLOPE
(back to her normal voice)
Ahhhh....I’m just kidding. Stop
crying, Taffyta.
TAFFYTA
(a total mess)
...I’m trying... it won’t stop.
RALPH
Wow, so this the real you, a
princess.
VANELLOPE
Ralph, what are you, nuts? This
isn’t me.
Vanellope concentrates and glitches right out of the dress
and crown and back into her regular clothes.

WRECK-IT RALPH

110

VANELLOPE (CONT’D)
This is me.
What?

RALPH

VANELLOPE
Look, the code may say I’m a
princess, but I know who I really
am, Ralph, I’m a racer with the
greatest superpower ever. I was
here. I was there. I was glitching
through the walls. I’m not giving
that up.
WYNNCHEL
Pardon me for asking, but without a
princess, who’s gonna lead us?
Yeah, who?

DUNCAN

VANELLOPE
Uhhhhh ME. I’m thinking more along
the lines of a constitutional
democracy. President Vanellope Von
Schweetz. Has a nice ring to it,
don’cha think?
CALHOUN
Fix-it, Wreck-it, the arcade’s
about to open. Let’s move ‘em out!
Felix joins Calhoun in the shuttle parked by the finish line.
Ralph turns to Vanellope. She runs into his arms.
VANELLOPE
You know, you could just stay here
and live in the castle. You’d have
your own wing where no one would
ever complain about your stench, or
treat you bad ever again. You could
be happy.
RALPH
I’m already happy. I’ve got the
coolest friend in the world....
(off her smile)
And besides, I’ve got a job to do,
too. It may not be as fancy as
being president, but it’s my duty.
And it’s a big duty.

WRECK-IT RALPH

Ha.

111
VANELLOPE

FELIX
Ralph? Are you coming, brother?
Ralph sets Vanellope down. They fist bump.
RALPH
See ya later, President
Fartfeathers.
VANELLOPE
Au revoir, Admiral Underpants.
RALPH
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.
VANELLOPE
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!
RALPH
Hasta la vista...
Ralph!

FELIX

RALPH
Alright, to be continued.
Yeah!

VANELLOPE

Ralph jumps in the shuttle and watches her until the door
closes.
CUT TO:
INT. BADANON
Ralph sits amongst the usual BadAnon folk.
RALPH
So yeah, I’m taking life one game
at a time, and I gotta tell ya, I
feel like a new Ralph.
The bad guys all clap.

WRECK-IT RALPH

112

INT. LITWAK’S ARCADE
Litwak grabs the out-of-order sign, just as Ralph rushes into
the game.
RALPH (IN GAME)
I’m gonna wreck it!
LITWAK
Hey, look at that! The gang’s all
here. False alarm.
Litwak crumples up the sign. The Moppet Girl starts to play
the game.
EXT. NICELANDER APARTMENTS — GAME PLAY: The same building.
Same game. Ralph falls in the mud. SPLAT.
RALPH (V.O.)
Course, the job hasn’t changed. But
the Nicelanders are actually being
nice to me.
The Nicelanders bring him a Penthouse cake. His ugly figurine
is on the roof of it with everyone else this time.
RALPH (V.O.)
And that got me thinking about
those guys left without a game.
EXT. NICELAND APARTMENTS: The homeless characters hang out
the windows and scream along with the Nicelanders as Ralph
and Coily wreck the building.
RALPH (V.O.)
So we asked some of our friends to
help us out on the bonus levels.
And I swear our game hasn’t been
this popular in years. The gamers,
they say we’re retro, which I think
means old but cool.
INT. LITWAK’S ARCADE: Kids line their quarters up on the Fixit Felix console while the moppet happily plays.
RALPH (IN GAME)
We’re gonna wreck it!
FELIX (IN GAME)
We can fix it!
EXT. NICELAND DUMP — AFTER HOURS: The dump has a new sign. It
reads “WELCOME TO EAST NICELAND.”

WRECK-IT RALPH

113

RALPH (V.O.)
Oh, and I decided that living in a
dump wasn’t making me feel very
good about myself.
Dig Dug helps dig as Ralph builds a rudimentary home. Nearby,
Felix completes a row of professional-looking homes. The
homeless characters cheer.
RALPH (V.O.)
So I cleaned it up. Built houses
for our new co-workers, too-- well,
with a little help from Felix.
INT. CHURCH DAY: Felix and Calhoun are getting married. Ralph
stands beside Felix as his best man.
RALPH (V.O.)
And guess who was the best man at
his and Calhoun’s wedding? Old hamhands himself.
All the soldiers are on Calhoun’s side of the aisle. All the
Nicelanders and random game characters on are Felix’s side.
RALPH (V.O.)
Very elegant affair-- lotta
grandeur. Not one bug.... And I’d
be a liar if I said no tears were
shed.
Felix goes in for the kiss. Calhoun first glances up to the
window, expecting a bug attack. The entire congregation cocks
their weapons. No bugs. Calhoun kisses Felix.
EXT. NICELAND APARTMENTS, ROOFTOP: Felix wins another medal,
which lowers from the sky, as the Nicelanders take Ralph onto
their shoulders.
Ralph is on the roof. He watches Felix get his medal. It
doesn’t phase him. He smiles and looks pretty darned content.
RALPH (V.O.)
But by far the best part of my day
is when I get thrown off the roof.
Because when the Nicelanders lift
me up... I get a perfect view of
Sugar Rush.
As they carry him to the edge of the roof, he looks out-RALPH’S POV: Through the arcade, a kid is playing as
Vanellope as she speeds through the Sugar Rush racetrack.

WRECK-IT RALPH

114

RALPH (V.O.)
Vanellope is a natural. And the
players, they all love her. Just
like I knew they would.
She tries to get around two racers, and with a glitch and a
flip, she takes the lead as the race ends. She wins!
She holds out a fist to the gamer. Words on the screen say,
“TOP SHELF.” The player fist-bumps the screen.
Vanellope then looks over at Ralph and gives a little wave.
EXT. NICELAND APARTMENTS ROOFTOP: Ralph beams with pride. He
waves back.
RALPH (V.O.)
Turns out, I don’t need a medal to
tell me I’m a good guy. ‘Cause if
that little kid likes me, how bad
can I be?
FINAL FADE OUT.
