EXT. GRANITE COUNTRY HOUSE - ICELAND - DAWN

In the grey dawn, a formidable house in the Icelandic
wilderness. A single light burns in an upper window.

July 20th, 1972

In the distance, a POLICE CAR approaches, lights flashing.

The

The HAND belongs to an intense young man with black hair
swept back. He sits motionless, peering at a chess game
which is a few moves old. The man is BOBBY FISCHER.
A SINGLE FLY begins to buzz against the window.
Bobby eyes the fly. The movement of his eyes is immense.
Murderous. The thread he has been picking at suddenly TEARS
with a THUNDEROUS RIPPING SOUND.
The fly is trying to get out the window.

BOBBY'S PERCEPTION

The BUZZING of the fly is a howling hurricane from hell.

BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE ROOM
Silence.
Bobby stalks the fly -- CRUSHING IT with a coffee cup.
He sits back down in a business-like way and stares at the
board again, his fingernail beginning to work another thread.
HEADLIGHTS sweep the room and we HEAR a car door SLAM.
Bobby's face betrays no reaction -- but his whole hand CLAWS
the arm of the chair like an animal in a trap.
At the SOUND of someone running upstairs, he glances from
the chessboard to the door, as a knock comes on the door:

BOBBY'S PERCEPTION

Someone is POUNDING on the door -- it SOUNDS like the Gestapo
in an old war movie.
6

BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW

The knock on the door is polite.
Bobby grips the armchair, can't stand the noise that only he
can hear -- and he gets to his feet, UPENDING a lamp.
Another knock.
Bobby pinballs around like the fly trying to escape -breaking shutters as he tries to close them, tripping over a
table. ANOTHER KNOCK, even louder.
Then, just as suddenly, his eyes FOCUS on the chess board.
A new light comes into his eyes as he stares at it -- and
his breathing begins to slow.

ALL SOUND BEGINS TO FADE

As he moves toward the board -- his fingers reaching out -in ultra slo-mo -- to make...a...single...move.

BACK TO THE SCENE
Bobby closes his eyes.

B7
Content.

He has solved the puzzle.

CAPTION: This is the true story of Bobby Fischer.
The door opens. A guy stands there -- mid-40's, pugnacious.
This is MARSHALL. He stares at the debris of the room. And
at Bobby, who appears perfectly calm.
BOBBY
There was a fly. It's dead now.
A huge agenda between the two men.

Marshall composes himself.

MARSHALL
(quoting)
"Never before in human history has
the outcome of an entire global war
of ideas rested on the shoulders of
one man."
The slightest smile begins to form on Bobby's lips.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)
I'm quoting the President of the
United States. He was talking about
you. To me. The President of the
United States talking to me. He
called three times. Three.
Marshall lifts the receiver, places a phone back on the hook.
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
He's been trying to reach you.
Bobby refuses to be intimidated. If anything, his smile
widens. Marshall rights an upturned chair.
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
In Moscow, Brezhnev opened his only
bottle of 1868 Louis Roederer. Left
over from the revolution. You know
why?
(hammering it home)
Because. He. Heard. You Quit.
Bobby walks to the window, looks out at the half-light.
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
There are boys your age in Vietnam
giving their lives right now in the
fight against Communism. And all
you have to do is win a game of chess.
(plaintively)
...Say something. Bobby, please...
Bobby?
Bobby doesn't answer. Instead, he stares out into the night,
and we HEAR another voice.
...Bobby?

Bobby, age 8, stands looking out another window.
JOAN, Bobby's sister, 14, comes up beside him.
JOAN
Bobby, it's bedtime.

It is 1952.

BOBBY
That man's out there.
Joan looks out. A SEDAN is parked under a streetlight. A
LIT MATCH briefly illuminates a MAN'S FACE as he lights a
cigarette. Is that a telephoto lens in his hand? She subtly
turns him away from the window.
JOAN
Have you eaten anything? There's
actually food in the house. Go.
Bobby heads back into a party in full swing. The apartment
is packed with Boho's, Eastern European emigres, NY
intellectuals. A banner reads, "Brooklyn-Bed Sty American
Communist Party PARTY! Coltrane wails on the record player.
BOBBY IS INVISIBLE IN THIS ADULT WORLD
Adults LOOM above him, laughing. A MIXED COUPLE making out,
open-mouthed. A man smoking reefer smiles beatifically. He
pauses to scribble chess notations in his little notebook.
PARTY GUEST #1
Half the witnesses they call are
Communists, the other half are Jews!
PARTY GUEST #3
If you're both, do you testify twice?
PARTY GUEST #1
You can make jokes, Mr. Liberal -your entire family wasn't gassed in

Regina, meanwhile, is in the middle of of an intense
conversation with a BALDING MAN. They WHISPER harshly.
REGINA
We agreed he wouldn't know who you
are--!
Fine.

BALDING MAN
But that doesn't mean----

Bobby is making a sandwich. The BALDING MAN approaches.
BALDING MAN
Howdy doody, Bobby...
Hullo.

BOBBY

BALDING MAN
Remember me...?
Sort of.

BOBBY

BALDING MAN
I'm your Uncle Paul. From Denver.

BALDING MAN
Studying hard?

BOBBY

BALDING MAN
Ever heard of Physics?
No.

BOBBY

BALDING MAN
But you're good in Math?
I guess.

BOBBY

The man stares at him -- there's something pregnant and
unspoken in his regard -- but also somehow thwarted.
BALDING MAN
I hear you like chess.

Yellow Revision 10-11-13
Yeah.

6.

BOBBY

He looks around, takes a five dollar bill from his pocket.
BALDING MAN
Here. Buy a new set. Just don't
tell your mother where it came from...
Bobby's eyes widen as he stares at the bill. The man reaches
out to HUG him, but Bobby shrinks away. Uncle Paul frowns,
settles for patting Bobby on the head and then walks away.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

A heated discussion of Zionism, the Rosenbergs. Bobby wanders
past, looks out the window. The DARK SEDAN is still there.
Regina is nearby, deep in conversation -- IN RUSSIAN.
Mama--

BOBBY

REGINA
Not now, honey.
BOBBY
I have to talk to you.
REGINA
Honey, it's past your bedtime.
BOBBY
That car's down there again.
Regina's antennae go up.
What car?

REGINA

BOBBY
You told me to tell you... A red,
1951 Chevy, NY license plate HI62579.
Regina apologizes to her friend in Russian, kneels down.

Yellow Revision 10-11-13
REGINA
Honey, it's okay-BOBBY
But you told me-REGINA
Bobby, you remember what I said about
not letting them intimidate us?
Yes, they watch us -- because we
represent something very threatening
to them, to the status quo. You
remember what that is?
BOBBY
(by rote)
Revolution.
REGINA
Yes! And sometimes these bad people
want to know about our work so they
spy on us. So if someone comes up to
you on the street and asks you
questions about me, or Mommy's
friends, what do you say?
BOBBY
(by rote)
I have nothing to say to you.
REGINA
That's my big boy.
(to Joan)
Joanie, he's got mustard on his shirt.
He has to wear that to school
tomorrow. Soak it for me?
Love to.

She takes Bobby's hand and leads him away.

Bobby lies in bed, wide awake. We HEAR the noise of the
party outside -- loud conversation, boisterous laughter.

Bobby stares at the window -- is the man still out there?
We feel his anxiety building as he LISTENS INTENTLY to the
sound of the shade SLAPPING against the window sill.
Suddenly, he sits up, opens a drawer. He works fast -- like
someone breaking the rules -- lights a candle -- rolls the
wax into balls and stuffs them into his ears.
The laughter outside is muted.
Bobby stuffs a ball into his other ear. With both ears
blocked -- a sudden and wonderful silence!
Bobby carries the candle to a CHESSBOARD. In absolute silence
he stares at the chessboard. In his hand is the NOTEBOOK.
CLOSE on Bobby's face, candlelit, a study in intensity.
As Bobby stares at the chessboard, everything else in the
room literally begins to disappear. The bed, the crummy
dresser -- until all that is left is a boy and a chessboard.

THE CHESSBOARD

Pieces move on their own. Multiple exposures. A move yields
hundreds of options. The counter offers thousands more.
CLOSE on Bobby's face.

Ethereal Music. Bliss.

Then...

THE DOOR TO HIS BEDROOM IS FLUNG OPEN
Light floods in. Harsh SOUNDS. The spell is broken. The
two open-mouthed kissers are looking for a place to fuck.
KISSING MAN
Whoopsee-daisy...
(sees Bobby)
Sorry, kiddo.
BOBBY
Get out of my room.

GET OUT!

Regina appears behind them.
REGINA
Bobby! Those are our guests!
(sees his chessboard)
Jesus, enough already with the chess!
She reaches for the board.

Pieces fall, ruining the game.

As Regina returns to the party. Joan kneels to pick up the
fallen pieces. Bobby looks up at her.
Please...?
Okay.

She sits beside him on the bed and sets up the board.

Bobby, Joan and Regina sit in a waiting room. Regina smooths
Bobby's hair.
REGINA
Now Bobby, don't suddenly start acting
normal and make me look ridiculous...
15

INT. DR. MENGARINI'S OFFICE - LATER
On DOCTOR MENGARINI's desk is a LARGE WOODEN CHESS SET.
Across the desk we find Bobby. The game is fifteen moves
old. Smoke from Megarini's pipe wafts among the chess pieces.
MENGARINI
So Bobby, you go to the movies?
(Bobby nods without
looking up)
You like Westerns? Bang, bang?
Bobby nods again.

Mengarini glances at Regina.

REGINA
Bobby, have you ever been to the
Moon on the subway?
Bobby nods and moves a piece.

He's in a kind of trance.

REGINA (CONT'D)
Once I poured a glass of water over
his head...
Mengarini studies Bobby as Bobby studies the board.
REGINA (CONT'D)
If I take the pieces away he just
plays in his head. Day and night.

MENGARINI (CONT'D)
You like Parchesi? Monopoly?
(to Joan)
Does he play other games with you?
JOAN
He says chess is the only game that
doesn't need luck.
Mengarini has barely finished moving when Bobby makes a move.
This startles Mengarini, who frowns at the new positions.
JOAN (CONT'D)
And he cries when he loses.
Bobby glares at her briefly then returns his focus to the
game. Mengarini squints at the board, then makes his move.
MENGARINI
I play chess at quite a high level.
His game is pretty good. Not
exceptional, though.
(magnanimously)
A draw?
Bobby isn't listening. He's in the zone. He initiates an
exchange: his Queen takes Mengarini's Bishop.
Mengarini grunts, makes another move.

Then Bobby pounces.

Mengarini tries to escape but the trap has been sprung.
After several moves it's clear he's doomed.
Mengarini is astonished. Bobby looks up at him -- something
new and...well...murderous in his expression.
JOAN
He hates draws.
MENGARINI
Where the hell did that come from?
REGINA
So now you see.
Mengarini is still staring at the board in disbelief.
MENGARINI
Who taught him to play like this?

Joan takes Bobby's hand and leads him out the door.
So, Doctor.

REGINA
What do you think?

MENGARINI
Mrs. Fischer, there are worse things
than playing chess. Believe me.
REGINA
He wants there to be nothing else.
Mengarini is now writing on a pad.
MENGARINI
I think he should see a professional.
REGINA
I thought you were a professional.
He hands her the note. "Carmine Nigro, Brooklyn Chess Club."

Bobby stares at the board, his face reddening. He has lost.
He HATES to lose. He pushes his chair back and walks away,
fighting back tears. Carmine turns to Regina.
CARMINE (CONT'D)
Well, I am officially the twentyfifth best chess player in New York
City. But he has great potential.
Suddenly, a piece is SLAPPED back on the board. Bobby has
returned and starts replacing pieces.

Nearby, two RUSSIAN PLAYERS have finished their game -they're shaking hands. A draw.
Bobby looks over, studying their board. Suddenly he stands
up from his game and approaches an ARBITER.
BOBBY

Excuse me. Over there -- the Russians -TBD has an opening on Petrosian,
instead he draws in fourteen moves?
ARBITER
If you'll take your seat please, Mr.

Carmine comes over.

Bobby, sit down, you don't want to

BOBBY
You see what they're up to? No matter

BOBBY
Didn't know you had a key.
JOAN

Say hello to your Uncle.
The girl shyly mumbles a hello.
BOBBY
You like chess, Lizzie? This is the

MARIA

Did you count them?
BOBBY
Are you interested in politics?
MARIA
I'm a Republican actually.
BOBBY
Right there, that's why you're a
virgin. Republicans only have sex
to have babies. Democrats have sex
because they can't help themselves.
Maria laughs again. Bobby is puzzled by her laughter. He rearranges the sugar cubes with his long fingers...
MARIA
Are you going to eat something?
Bobby puts a sugar cube into his mouth.

Peers at her.

BOBBY
Do you play chess?
No.
Good.

BOBBY

Maria takes a breath, decides to be bold.
MARIA
Joan said you've quit traveling all
over to tournaments and maybe you'd
like to start doing regular things.
Maria thinks maybe she is one of the regular things he might
do. He smiles then peers at Maria's face. After a moment...
Beautiful.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
Black King here.
He touches her chin. As Bobby names different chess pieces
he gently touches her eyes, her cheeks, her ears, placing
each piece as if Maria's face were a chessboard...
BOBBY (CONT'D)
White Knight, black pawn, white rook,
black Bishop to your chin-Maria has closed her eyes, his touch is gentle.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
--your ear to your nose and taking
out an eye for a cheek bone. Move

A pause. Bobby stares at her face and looks troubled...

Beautiful like a Picasso.
Maria opens her eyes -- overwhelmed by his gentle physicality.

You believe in love.

BOBBY
Like a rock. Like a baseball bat.
MARSHALL
You told the truth about the Russians.

Sometimes the truth is a hand grenade.

Marshall produces a chess magazine, drops it on the table.
MARSHALL
There's been an announcement.

'Soviet invasion to hit California

BOBBY
Yeah. They're coming to California
to play in The Piatigorsky.
MARSHALL
They say it's just a game, for fun,

Bobby has slept on the beach. His clothes are rumpled and
his hair is wild. As he sits up he sees an odd sight.
A hundred yards down the beach, a big black limo has disgorged
three MEN. Two are KGB. The third is wearing a Beverly Hills
hotel bathrobe. It's Boris Spassky, come for his morning
swim. The KGB men carry his clothes.
Bobby watches, fascinated, as Boris shrugs off his bathrobe
and begins an exercise regime. Bobby gets to his knees as
Boris walks into the ocean and begins to swim. The KGB guys
smoke cigarettes, waiting for Boris to finish.
As Boris steps out of the ocean, a KGB guy holds out a towel
for him. Bobby leaps to his feet and yells...
BOBBY
Hey!! Asshole!! They're not
bodyguards, they're jailers!! They've
got your brain. They're inside your
mind! They wouldn't even let you
kill yourself if you wanted!!
Boris looks up as Bobby yells, but he is far away and looks
like a bum, so he doesn't immediately recognize him...

Just some drunk sleeping it off.
America is full of them.
Bobby, meanwhile, is laughing to himself. He steps into the
ocean, fully clothed, and begins to splash around...

Look at me man, I'm free!
He jumps into the waves and begins to play. Boris stares and
slowly realizes it's Bobby.

get ready -- 'cause I'M...COMING!!

The walls, the camera, eventually even Spassky DISAPPEARS.
Until it is only Bobby and the chessboard -- which begins to
GLOW as the lines of infinite possibility present themselves.
Bobby makes his move and SLAPS his clock. Boris examines
Bobby's move with more than a little confusion. He looks up
and sees no expression on Bobby's face.
Bobby is in the zone. He has reached some kind of absence
