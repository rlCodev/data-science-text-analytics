INT: MICROSCOPIC VIEW

The beginning of all there is. We follow simple AMOEBAS
floating about. They are shapeless single-celled organisms
which bob to and fro. Suddenly, a BIGGER AMOEBA begins to
PUSH AROUND the smaller amoebas, asserting its dominance.
Three tiny YELLOW (MINION) AMOEBAS observe, but then an EVEN
BIGGER AMOEBA gobbles up the smaller one. The tiny Minion
amoebas follow the carnivorous one off-screen.
As bigger and more EVIL CREATURES present themselves, the
Minion Amoebas start following THEM. Yes, ever since the
beginning of time, Minions just wanted to serve the most
wicked master.
We FOLLOW THE MINION AMOEBAS through time, as they slowly
evolve, growing eyes, arms, etc. Their masters evolve as
well. Eventually they begin following EVIL FISH, and then an
EVIL AMPHIBIAN.
As the Evil Amphibian swims to the surface, the three Minions
are joined by HUNDREDS of OTHER MINIONS, as they happily
follow their new master out of the water.

The T-Rex walks along, followed by a group of Minions.
Numerous Minions ride on top of him, scratching his back and
scrubbing his head.
NARRATOR (V.O)
Making their master happy was the
tribe’s very reason for existence.
That’s not to say that they didn’t
have OTHER passions....
Two Minions notice bananas growing on a bush.
Oh, hey!

MINION 1
Looka! C’est un banono!

One tries to pull a banana from beneath a large boulder.
finally pulls it out and holds it above his head
triumphantly.

The boulder then rolls down a steep hill toward the T-Rex.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Finding a boss was easy. But
KEEPING a boss, therein lies the
rub.
The boulder hits the T-Rex and sends him rolling down the
hill, balancing on the boulder with his hind legs. The
Minions follow him frantically.
Boss!

The T-Rex dodges tree branches as he heads toward the edge of
a cliff, which launches into a volcano. He manages to stop
at the very edge.
Three Minions look down after him, wanting to help, but are
accidentally pushed forward when the others arrive. They
roll down toward the T-Rex. Two are stopped by rocks, but
the last one stops just short of the boulder. As he sits up,
he accidentally knocks his head against the boulder, which
sends the T-Rex plummeting into the volcano. The Minions
begin to CRY. One SLAPS the Minion who caused the boulder to
fall.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Nope, it wasn’t easy for these
guys. BUT they never gave up.
THE IMAGE DISSOLVES into a CAVE PAINTING depicting the TRex’s plunge into the volcano.

The Pharaoh proudly SNAPS HIS WHIP before HUNDREDS OF

The Dark Ages were actually fun

The Minions pull open his coffin, waking him up...

Years passed, as the Minions forged
their own civilization. They truly
made a life for themselves.
More Minions throw snowballs at each other as their
UNDERGROUND VILLAGE builds up behind them. As time goes on,
we see their snowball fight become lethargic and boring.

became aimless, and depressed.
A Minion plays ping-pong with his buddy, but his friend is SO
DEPRESSED he lets the ball bounce off his head.

cards with his speech.

He was EXCITED to share his idea
with the tribe. He’d been
preparing for days, weeks,
months...but now he was ready!
The Minions start lumbering toward him.

THIS IS IT.

...but Kevin fumbles his cards.

They’re all out of order.

He makes up his mind to go ahead with it and defiantly tosses
them to the side.

The Queen smiles, goes to scratch her head--THE QUEEN
Ha ha, yes, good show, good show!
I-----only to find her CROWN IS GONE!
THE QUEEN (CONT’D)
My crown is gone! It’s gone!!
The Bobbies and Royal Guard begin searching the crowd...
Blimey!

...but Kevin sees SCARLET AND HERB RUNNING FROM THE SCENE.
Hey!

HEY!

KEVIN
Scarlet!

Kevin runs after them.
SCARLET OVERKILL
They took everything from me! My
castle! My reputation! Things
look bleak, baby, I’m not gonna
lie! But now AT LEAST I HAVE MY
CROWN!
SUDDENLY, Scarlet and Herb are hit by a RAY which FREEZES
THEM IN A BLOCK OF ICE.
The ice SLIDES across the ground until it is stopped by a
FOOT. We see that the foot belongs to a YOUNG GRU. He is
holding a FREEZE-RAY.
Gru takes the crown.
SCARLET OVERKILL (CONT’D)
Child, give me that BACK!
LITTLE GRU
No, I don’t think so.
SCARLET OVERKILL
You have NO IDEA who you’re messing
with! I am the greatest super
villain of all time.

Gru hops on his bike. LITTLE KYLE waits for him in the side
seat. He puts the crown on Kyle’s head.
Gru GUNS IT.

The bike CONVERTS into a jet...

Kevin CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

He points to Gru!

KEVIN (CONT’D)

He runs after Gru.

The Minion tribe follows.

Ah! Get back here--Are you really

THE END
The CREDITS ROLL, interspersed with animated vignettes of Gru
and the Minions:
--The Minions follow Gru in a single-file line. They bump
into him and he shoos them away, but they only IMITATE his
shooing gesture. They begin to imitate all his other
movements, until he begins RUNNING IN PLACE and they get
tripped up and FALL OVER.
--Gru peels a BANANA. The Minions see this and begin to
surround him, until he RUNS AWAY offscreen with the Minions
giving chase. Norbert FALLS while running and places his
STARFISH strategically on his chest, as he did in the film.
--Bob runs across the screen wearing the FAR OUT STRETCH
SUIT. Gru follows, wearing his own suit, except he has
clusters of Minions attached to the legs, making it difficult
for him to walk.
--Gru sneaks up on a SLEEPING KYLE. He gestures the Minions
to come over, carrying a BATHTUB. They place the tub on the
ground, and as Gru is about to ambush Kyle, Stuart snaps a
PHOTO. The flash awakens Kyle and he ATTACKS Gru. Stuart
snaps photos of Gru being attacked.
--The Minions approach a giant PAINTING of GRU’S MOM. They
begin to vandalize it, drawing googly eyes and an afro on her
image. Gru appears onscreen and considers the vandalized
painting for a moment, before drawing a YELLOW MUSTACHE on
it. The Minions laugh until Gru’s Mom appears, when they
unabashedly BLAME GRU.
--The Minions gather around Gru, embracing him in a large
GROUP HUG. A pile of Minions fills the screen. Gru’s head
pops out of the pile, SMILING HAPPILY.
--POST CREDITS: The Minions and other characters from the
movie sing a version of The Beatles’ “Revolution.”
