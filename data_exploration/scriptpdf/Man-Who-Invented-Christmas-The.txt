A STAGE MANAGER knocks and calls out in a Brooklyn accent:
STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
Five minutes...five minutes
Ink stained fingers fumble with silver CUFF LINKS. A pair of
BOOTS is smartly buffed. A brightly coloured SILK SCARF is
adjusted.
DICKENS (V.O.)
Of the crowds that pour in and out
the whole day; of the people that
line the streets when I go out...
In the mirror, the writer (CHARLES DICKENS) looking like an
English rock star in his prime (silk blouse, tight trousers,
velvet jacket), fusses with the locks on his forehead, then
steps back and regards himself critically.
DICKENS (V.O.)
....of the balls, dinners,
speeches, parties, assemblies
without end. There never was a king
or Emperor upon the Earth, so
cheered.
He breaks into a wide grin.
DICKENS
‘Ello, Charlie.
Another knock at the door breaks the moment.
STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
Places, please. Places.

PARK THEATER. CORRIDOR & STAGE- CONTINUOUS

Dickens moves along the corridor. The sounds of the crowd
stomping their feet and clapping their hands gets louder as
he nears the stage.
DICKENS (V.O.)
They come from the lakes, the
rivers, the back-woods, the loghouses, the cities, factories,
villages and townsA PRESENTER is making a flowery introduction on stage. The
sound of the crowd is deafening.
PRESENTER
....The great magician of our time,
whose wand is a book. The
Shakespeare of the novel. The
people's author.
Dickens reaches the wings. He breathes in deeply through his
nose, steadying himself. He nods at the Stage Manager.
Ready?
Ready.

STAGE MANAGER
DICKENS

PRESENTER (O.S.)
... the one and only, the
inimitable, the great and
marvellous Boz! Ladies and
gentlemen- Mr. Charles Dickens!
The stagehands raise the curtain. Dickens takes a deep breath
and steps into the light. At the sight of him, the audience
rises to its feet as one.
Behind him “TABLEAUX VIVANTS” appear, depicting sights and
scenes of London, Beef Eaters roll out canons, characters
from Oliver Twist come to life, urchins dance along to the
band.
Dickens taking this in.

DICKENS (V.O.)
Americans are friendly, earnest,
hospitable, kind, frank,
accomplished, warm-hearted, fervent
and enthusiastic...
Uncertainly, he raises his arms above his head. The crowd
goes wilder still, BLANKETING the stage with flowers and
SCREAMING “BOZ, BOZ, BOZ”.
Dickens attempts to speak to the crowd.
DICKENS
Dear friends, you have welcomed me
to your country with such open arms
that I fear that IBut his speech is cut off by a deafening volley as the
cannons behind him fire ticker tape into the air. Dickens
shrinks, covering his ears.

INT. DICKENS STUDY - MORNING

Dickens sits at his desk, pen in hand, in front of a blank
piece of paper, as if willing something to appear.
After a moment, he throws the pen down and gets up to look in
the mirror, making a face.
He picks up an ACCORDION and plays a few squeaky NOTES.
DICKENS

Yanky doodle, doodle dandy
Turn right round in the bottom of

There is a tentative KNOCK at the door. He throws it open in
frustration.

Mrs. Fisk. I have told you
repeatedly not to disturb me when
I’m working.

MRS. FISK, the housekeeper, a rather severe Scotswoman, is

DICKENS

INT. DICKENS HOUSE/HALLWAY - MORNING

The front hall is full of workmen, including the energetic
SIGNOR MAZZINI, who is busy directing traffic, as various of
the DICKENS CHILDREN run in and out of the chaos.
SIGNOR MAZZINI
Adesso! Subito! Veni qui!
Kate gives a tour to Dickens’ friend and de facto literary
manager, JOHN FORSTER -- a big, pleasant-looking man with a
Geordie accent.
KATE
You see, Mr. Forster, we’re having
all new wallpaper. French. New
doors, new roller blinds for the
windows, new book-cases in the
library, all chosen by Charles, of
course. And the staircase is to be
painted green
(to Signor Mazzini)
— though not too dull a green,
Signor Mazzini.
SIGNOR MAZZINI
Si, si. Capice.
KATE
(to Forster)
You know how Charles is.
FORSTER
The best is good enough for me!
KATE
I wish he’d redecorate that study
of his. It’s like an animal’s den.
But he won’t let anyone touch it!
Two workmen pass between them carrying a large chandelier.

FORSTER
Splendid, Mrs. Dickens. In fact, I
intend to ask her to bestow upon

ever know.
Kate stares at him, uncomprehending.
FORSTER (CONT’D)
To marry me.
Oh!

KATE

She embraces him, causing him to flush a deep crimson.
KATE (CONT'D)
I am very glad to hear it.
Dickens comes thundering down the stairs.
DICKENS
Forster. Good Lord. I completely
lost track of the time.
Kate puts out a hand.
KATE
Charles. We need to pay Signor
Mazzini. For the parlour mantle.
How much?

DICKENS

SIGNOR MAZZINI
Seventy-five pounds.
Dickens staggers back.
DICKENS
Seventy-five — what is it made of,

less.

Forster bows to Kate.
FORSTER
Good day, Mrs. Dickens.
KATE
Good day, Mr. Forster.
Dickens is nearly out the door, where a WORKMAN is busy
attaching a shiny new knocker.
FORSTER
I’ll hail us a cab.
DICKENS
Waste of money. We’ll walk.
FORSTER
Walk? Are you mad?
Dickens rushes out, followed by Forster. They head down the
street at pace, the London skyline in the distance.
DICKENS
The best way to lengthen our days
is to walk steadily and with a
purpose.

A publishing house in The Strand. In the outside office, a
nervous young CLERK listens to a heated conversation in the
other room.
FORSTER (O.S.)
Gentlemen, we don’t seem to
understand one another. I asked you
a simple question: where is the
money?
CHAPMAN (O.S.)
The money, Mr. Forster—

FORSTER (O.S.)
Yes. Money. You know: Pounds,
shillings, stumpy, shiners, joeys—
A huge CRASH, then silence. The clerk winces.

INT. CHAPMAN AND HALL. INNER OFFICE - DAY

11

Forster stands by an overturned tea trolley. Crockery
everywhere. He gestures apologetically at the two publishers,
CHAPMAN (rather portly and florid ) and HALL (tall and
angular).
FORSTER
I do apologize.
He attempts to pick up the broken crockery.
FORSTER (CONT’D)
Bull in a china shop.
CHAPMAN
Please don’t trouble yourself.
Forster resumes his tirade.
FORSTER
Charles Bloody Dickens! The bestselling bloody author in the
history of English bloody
literature —
He gestures towards Dickens. Dickens’ lips are pressed
together, his attention on a magazine publication. The
headline on it reads “Martin Chuzzlewit, A Tedious Journey.”
FORSTER (CONT’D)
Three of his books you’ve published
in the last year and a half. Three.
So— where is the money?
CHAPMAN
Mr. Forster. Like you, we are as
Puzzled as the Egyptians in their
Fog.
Howzat?

FORSTER

HALL
The Excitement with which a Popular
Reputation is Kept up to the
Highest Selling Mark will always be
Subject to Lulls too Capricious for
Explanation.

No joke. I heard they were burning
copies in the streets.
Forster notices Dickens pained look.
FORSTER (CONT’D)
Mad as snakes, the Yanks.
Forster renews his attack.
FORSTER (CONT’D)
And what about this fifty pounds a
month you’re withholding from his
royalties? What’s the explanation
for that?
The two publishers squirm uncomfortably. Chapman produces the
contract and peers at it to cover his nervousness.
HALL
You May Remember that when Mr.
Dickens Approached us about the
Tour to America, we were Pleased to
Provide Him with an Interest-Free
Loan —
He falters. Chapman continues.
CHAPMAN
With the Provision That— In the
Unlikely Case of Profits being
Inadequate to Certain Repayments—
Forster erupts.

wouldn't exist without this man!
Chapman gives Dickens a nervous look.
CHAPMAN
Actually, we do have a Suggestion—
HALL
– very Popular with the Reading
Public —
CHAPMAN
Perhaps Mr. Dickens might consider—
HALL
— and a lot of Money to be Made in–
CHAPMAN
— a Railway Edition of his works?
Dickens is frowning.
FORSTER
You’re not serious? Those cheap
yellow-backed jobs? With adverts
for fig syrup on the cover?
They all watch as Dickens gets to his feet. He turns the
magazine publication over to obscure his bad Chuzzlewit
review.
DICKENS
What about an advance?
-- on?

CHAPMAN

DICKENS
(bluffing)
...A new book.
HALL
You have a New Book in mind?
FORSTER
Of course he does...

Gentlemen. I bid you good day.
He sweeps out of the room.
CHAPMAN
Mr. Forster: Please. We had no
Intention of Causing Offense.
FORSTER
Ay. He’s in a fettle now. Give him
a day to calm down —
HALL
And then... It's Most Awkward...
“He” was in last week. In some
Difficulty. Again.
FORSTER
No, that’s not possible. He’s in
the countryside. Under strict
instructions to remain there.

FORSTER (CONT’D)
What is it this time?
Chapman hands him a letter and an envelope.
FORSTER (CONT’D)

“...need money immediately or
productive of fatal consequences...
I beseech you to do the needful...”
Forster shakes the envelope, causing several SLIPS OF PAPER
to fall out, each one torn from a letter, each with a
signature: Charles Dickens. Forster makes a face.

EXT. GARRICK CLUB - AFTERNOON

12

A Georgian building near Covent Garden, once a private house,
now a gentlemen’s club, with a brass plate beside the door:
THE GARRICK CLUB. And underneath, the motto: “ALL THE WORLD’S
A STAGE.” FORSTER rushes in, umbrella in hand.
13

INT.

GARRICK CLUB. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

13

A cozy dining room, typical of a Victorian men’s club. Beside
the bar, a group of SMART YOUNG MEN are gathered, gossiping
and making quips. At the centre of the group is a tall fellow
with a braying laugh (WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY).
Dickens stands by the cloak room, holding a newspaper in
front of his face.
Charles?

FORSTER (O.S.)

Dickens folds down a corner of the newspaper.
Shhh...

DICKENS

FORSTER
What are you doing over here?
Dickens gestures towards the group.
DICKENS
I’m hiding. From Thackeray. He’ll
want to commiserate with me on my
Chuzzlewit reviews. Which he will
quote by heart.
Forster walks into the dining room. Dickens scuttles after
him, taking care not to be seen by Thackeray. Forster grabs a
chair and cranes his head around.

An elderly WAITER appears and bows low, losing his balance.
He fixes his gaze somewhere above their heads.
Gentlemen?

WAITER

FORSTER
You’re not Robertson.
WAITER
The name is Marley, sir.
Marley?

Dickens gets out a pencil and a notebook.

The waiter’s eyes flicker with apprehension.
Yes, sir.

Don’t worry. He collects names.
Let’s have some oysters. And a
bottle of champagne.

Very good, sir.
The waiter exits, at a stately pace.

Thackeray has somehow materialized at their table, an evil
glint in his eyes.
DICKENS
Thackeray. How are you?
THACKERAY
Tolerable I thank ye. Charles. I
must say, I’m relieved to see you
out and about.
Relieved?

DICKENS

THACKERAY
You know. After those vile things
they wrote about Chuzzlewit. I
won’t even call them reviews.
DICKENS
No matter, I never read them.
Forster shoots him a skeptical look.
THACKERAY
Quite right. Scandalous, what one
is allowed to print nowadays.
He waits. Dickens grits his teeth.
DICKENS
Why? What did they say?
THACKERAY
“Dull, vapid, and vulgar... Not a
single character capable of
exciting the reader's sympathy.”
(beat)
I certainly didn’t think it was
vulgar.
Dickens gives him a tight smile.
THACKERAY (CONT’D)
Oh, look! There’s Macready. Poor
thing. His Macbeth was absolutely
shredded in The Times. I must go
and give him my condolences.
Thackeray wafts away to rejoin the group at the bar.
DICKENS
I’m sick of London. Over-crowded,
over-priced--

It’s your inspiration. You’re whatdo-you-call it? Magic lantern.
The waiter arrives. He opens the bottle with some difficulty,
then bangs a plate of oysters down on the table and leaves.
DICKENS
I tell you, Forster, my lamp’s gone
out. I’ve run out of ideas. I feel
old.
FORSTER
Old. Whssht. You’re a puppy.
Forster pours some champagne.
FORSTER (CONT’D)
You’re exhausted, that’s what. Too
many speeches.
DICKENS
I’ve got one tomorrow, for the
Children’s Refuge.
FORSTER
You have to learn to say no.
DICKENS
How can I? If I can be useful.
FORSTER
You’ll have to. What with your new
commission.
DICKENS
Forster, I just told you—
He stops himself.
DICKENS (CONT’D)

FORSTER
From Chapman and Hall. For your
next book.

He grins and helps himself to the oysters.

INT.

STUDY - NIGHT

14

Dickens goes through a complicated pre-writing ritual:
straightening everything on his desk, paper, ink, pen knife,
quills; then rapidly touching his desk ornaments one by one:
a CUP with fresh flowers in it, a pair of BRONZE TOADS, a
RABBIT, and a CERAMIC MONKEY.
He places a blank sheet in front of him, dips his pen in ink,
then stares at the paper, once again willing something to
appear.
INK drips slowly from the pen onto the page.
He hears a strange, unearthly cry coming from nearby.
VOICE (O.S.)
Ul-ul-alul-alu!
He opens the door, listening.

INT. DICKENS HOUSE. NURSERY - NIGHT

15

Dickens descends the stairs to the nursery. A young
nursemaid, TARA is telling a bedtime story to the children in
a soft Irish lilt.
TARA
... And on Christmas Eve, they say,
the fairy mounds open wide, and the
fire spirits pour into the night...
and then the Lord of the Dead leads
all of the spirits in a Wild Hunt.
And he calls to them...
She throws back her head.

Charley adores her.
The candle sputters. She lights a new one.

end up in the Poor House.
Kate laughs.
KATE
You are funny.
DICKENS
I’m not joking.
KATE

insist on moving to a bigger house,
and order all new fixtures, and
then you complain about a new
candle.
Dickens speaks with a fervid intensity.

A match flares and touches the wick of a magic lantern.
VOICE (O.S.)
And now for this year’s Christmas
present!
Above it, the genial face of a middle-aged man appears,(whom
we will come to know as JOHN DICKENS). He is dressed in the
elaborate headdress of a stage magician.
MR. DICKENS
I am the necromancer, Rhia Rhama
Rhoos, educated cabalistically in
the Orange Groves of Salamanca.
Behold!
He CLAPS his hands, theatrically.
YOUNG CHARLES (AGE 10) and his six brothers and sisters are
settled in front of a sheet hanging from the clothes horse.

holly and mistletoe.
Mr. Dickens slips a painted slide into the magic lantern and
an image appears on the sheet: an angel, hovering above a
group of shepherds.
Ohhh...

CHILDREN

Then, a bearded hunter, with a stag over his shoulder.
Ahhh....

CHILDREN(CONT’D)

Then, Aladdin and his lantern.
Hooray!

CHILDREN(CONT’D)

On the faces of the children, there is a look of utter
enchantment, but most particularly Young Charles.
A terrifying ghost appears next. Young Charles covers his
face with his hands.
YOUNG CHARLES
No. Go away.
Mr. Dickens puts his hand on the young boy’s head to comfort
him.
Mr. DICKENS
It’s all right, Charlie. I’m here.
You’re safe.
Young Charles climbs into his father’s arms.
MR. DICKENS (CONT’D)
Here. Now. I’ll show you how to get
rid of bad spirits. Ready?
They CLAP their hands together. The light on the magic
lantern goes out, and the Ghost disappears.

He moves on to Walter, standing as straight as he can.
Dickens salutes.

Master Corporal Skittles. Sir.
He stares fixedly at Walter’s shoes.
Ahem.

The little boy self-consciously rubs one on the back of his
leg. Dickens nods, approvingly. He moves on to Kate.

Hello, Lucifer Box.

Hello, Papa.
Dickens offers her his handkerchief.

I see you’ve made a conquest.
Tara ruffles Charley’s hair.
Dickens (CONT’D)
What were you telling the children
last night? About the fairies?
Tara glances at Mrs. Fisk, nervously.
TARA
Only a story my gran used to tell
us, sir. Back home in Ireland. She
used to say that on Christmas Eve
the veil between this world and the
next thins out. And that’s when the
spirits cross over, and walk among
us.
Dickens reflects on this.

Pickpockets, streetwalkers, charity
boys. Those people don’t belong in
books.
DICKENS
Those people? You mean, the poor?
They continue outside the building where Dickens indicates to
a knot of BARE-FOOT URCHINS, watching from the shadows.
Grimsby straightens up.
MR. GRIMSBY
Look here, Mr. Dickens. I’m a selfmade man. I pulled myself up by my
own bootstraps, never asked for
anything from anyone that I wasn’t
willing to pay for.

DICKENS
No help from anyone?
None.

MR. GRIMSBY

MRS. GRIMSBY
Well, Papa did give us a very small
cotton mill for our wedding.
Mr. Grimsby ignores this, whilst shoeing away a poor urchin
begging for money.
DICKENS
What would you suggest we do about
“those people”?
MR. GRIMSBY
Are there no workhouses?
DICKENS
Do you know that many people had
rather die than go there?
MR. GRIMSBY
Then they had better do it, and
reduce the surplus population.
Dickens struggles to control his temper.
DICKENS
Will you excuse me? I have a -- I
must-- good evening.
He strides off.
21

EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

21

Dickens strides angrily through the chaotic, noisy streets of
London, past WAITERS thrusting handbills into the hands of
passersby, CABBIES soliciting fares, a BALLAD SINGER croaking
out a tune, a barefooted CROSSING SWEEPER leaping into the
street to clear away the manure.
A TOOTHLESS MAN in a long cloak approaches emerges out of the
crowd and flashes Dickens a lop-sided grin.
TOOTHLESS MAN
Care to buy? Hard workers. Suitable
for factory work or chimney
sweeping.
Moving aside his cloak he reveals two CHILDREN, a boy and a
girl, pale and emaciated, clinging to his legs. Dickens reels
back in shock.

DICKENS
Let them go! Let them go, or I’ll
have the police after you.
The man turns and runs, the children in tow. Dickens tries to
give chase across the street, but is nearly knocked over by a
large cart drawn by four horses. On the side the words are
written: “Warren’s Blacking: The Pride of Mankind”.
Dickens freezes. He looks around. The toothless man and his
children are gone. Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he gives chase down a
darkened alleyway. Faster he goes, left, right, until he is
completely disorientated.
22

EXT. CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

22

Turning a corner, Dickens finds himself in the graveyard of a
church and collapses under a tree, exhausted. He closes his
eyes.
VOICE #1 (O.S.)
I lift up mine eyes unto the hills
From whence cometh my help
My help cometh even from the Lord
Who hath made heaven and earth-A gravelly voice cuts him off.
VOICE #2 (O.S.)
-- All right. I’m not paying you by
the hour. Skip to the end.
Dickens opens his eyes. In the glow of a lantern, a graveside burial is taking place, attended only by a red-nosed
CLERIC in a threadbare black coat, and a LONE MOURNER in a
black silk hat, and two stalwart GRAVE-DIGGERS.
CLERIC
(rapidly)
Rest eternal grant to him, O Lord:
And let light perpetual shine upon
him. Amen.
Amen.

LONE MOURNER

The Lone Mourner presses a coin into the clergyman’s hand and
strides away, clearly anxious to be gone.
The Grave-diggers shuffle towards the grave, spades in hand.
Grave Digger #1 points towards the coffin.
GRAVE DIGGER #1
Shame, innit? All that money and noone to mourn him.

GRAVE DIGGER #2
-- except Old Scratch there.
He nods towards the departing Lone Mourner.
Who is he?

GRAVE DIGGER #1

GRAVE DIGGER #2
His business partner. The meanest
cur on two legs, so they say.
Dickens shrinks against the wall as the Lone Mourner passes
him, shooting him a look of pure malice.
Humbug.

LONE MOURNER

Dickens recoils.
23

EXT./INT. DICKENS HOUSE - NIGHT

23

Dicken returns home, in a state of agitation, muttering to
himself.
DICKENS
Old Scratch... all that money...
shame...
He reaches for the doorknocker when suddenly the door flies
open. Dickens reacts as the knocker comes away in his hand.
MRS. FISK
Good evening, sir.
DICKENS
Indeed, Mrs. Fisk.
He hands her his hat, and heads for the stairs, holds on to
the knocker, not quite sure what to do with it, past the
dining room where the whole family sits waiting for him.
Charles?

KATE

Dickens is oblivious.
Humbug!

DICKENS (CONT’D)

Forster and the publishers nod their heads with enthusiasm,

He chortles at his own joke.
CHAPMAN

Who Never misses an Opportunity to

Dickens stares at them. Hall shifts uncomfortably. An awkward
silence.
CHAPMAN
What We Mean to Say, Mr. Dickens,
is, Not Much Market for “Christmas

Dickens tries to control his rising temper.
Dickens
It is a Christmas book because
Christmas is— or ought to be— the
one time of the year when men and
women open their shut-up hearts,
and think of the people below them
as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave, and not

Forster and Dickens, in his new clothes, perch on
uncomfortable chairs in the office of his solicitor.
Dickens’s eyes dart around the room: at the PAPERS stained
with coffee, GLASSES WITH MOLD halfway up the side. A SAFE,
wound round and about with heavy chains.
The door flies open and THOMAS HADDOCK, appears, in a faded
coat over a threadbare waistcoat.
HADDOCK
Mr. Dickens. Mr. Forster. How do
you?
DICKENS
Very well, thank you, Mr. Haddock.
HADDOCK

DICKENS
Well, sir, it’s about the loan-MR. HADDOCK

something I wanted to tell you.
What was it?
Haddock gets up and starts to rifle through some DOG-EARED
FILES on the desk.
HADDOCK
It was rather good news, as I
recall-Haddock finds a plate of biscuits under one of the files them
and offers them to Forster.
FORSTER

HADDOCK
Bankrupt... Disappointing, I

Dickens shakes his head, repulsed.
DICKENS
No. No. No.
HADDOCK
As you wish. Meanwhile, if you

Haddock unlocks a METAL CASE wrapped round with CHAINS and
takes out a paper, stamped “Payment on Demand”.
HADDOCK (CONT’D)
Here’s my bill. No rush. Next week

Haddock dips his biscuit in his tea, placidly. Dickens
attempts to stifle his anxiety.

I’m waiting for a big royalty
cheque from America. A trifling

Forster?
Forster nearly chokes on his biscuit.
FORSTER
Mm? Something like that.
The solicitor listens attentively.
DICKENS
Tell you what... why don’t we defer
this bill until, say January. And,
while we’re at it, perhaps you
might add a little more to it. I’ll
make it worth your while.
HADDOCK
More? You mean, borrow more?
DICKENS
Not much— perhaps 300 pounds?
Until— until, January.
Forster reaches for the tea. The solicitor thinks. Dickens
looks pale, wipes his brow.
HADDOCK
I’m sure we can work something out.
At, say, twenty-five percent?
Forster can’t contain himself.
FORSTER
God’s teeth!
The cat leaps off Forster’s lap with a piteous MEOW. Dickens
is not well. Ashen.
HADDOCK
However, I will require the money
to be repaid at the end of January
without fail.

Of course. Forster here will sort

Tara’s takes out a Penny Dreadful magazine and reluctantly
hands it over to Dickens. Dickens examines the cover: a
winged vampire with bloody teeth.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
“Varney the Vampire: The Feast of
Blood.” Any good?
TARA
Oh, yes, sir. Thrilling.

Oh, Mr. Scrooge. You and I are

Dickens starts scratching away, while Scrooge peers over his
shoulder, smiling.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
Oh, but he was a tight-fisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge. A
squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,
from which no steel had ever struck
out generous fire; secret, and selfcontained and solitary as an
oyster.
Dickens glances over his shoulder. Scrooge immediately
rearranges his features into a scowl.
There is a KNOCK at the door.

angrily. Scrooge immediately reappears, a look of alarm on
his face.
SCROOGE
Don’t do that.

The lights in the room dim one by one. Suddenly, the door
flies open and the ghost of JACOB MARLEY (bearing a strong
resemblance to his solicitor, Haddock), covered in chains,
padlocks, cash-boxes and steel purses, appears. Scrooge
attempts a smile.

benevolence, were, all, my
business. But I did none of these.

He was never one for a straight

Marley clanks into the room, dragging his chains.

You are in chains. Tell me why.

will, and of my own free will I
wore it.

Or would you know the weight and
length of the strong coil you bear

takes a careful step towards Marley.

Marley leans towards him, confidentially. He walks around
Dickens, circling him with a loose chain.
MARLEY
Chains man, all around you. Past...

Dickens stares at him, his mind racing. And with that, Marley
pulls the loose chain tight around Dickens.

INT. DICKENS FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

39

The children crowd around the Christmas table. Mr. Dickens at
the head, in a richly patterned waistcoat.
A cheer goes up as Mrs. Dickens, sets a large turkey down on
the table. Mr. Dickens holds up his hands for silence. He
intones.
MR. DICKENS
Hail to thee blithe turkey. Whose
exquisite odours now perfume the
circumambient air. So let this day
be fragrant with the love we bear
each other. And may God bless us
everyone.
He winks at YOUNG CHARLES, who stares up at him with
adoration.
YOUNG CHARLES
....every one.
Suddenly, the door flies open. A BAILIFF fills the door
frame, accompanied by two burly Deputies.
BAILIFF
Mr. John Dickens?
MR. DICKENS
That is my name.
BAILIFF
Come with me.
MR. DICKENS
What is the meaning of this
termagant breach of our Yuletide
feast?
Eh?

months in arrears.
The bailiff holds out a set of handcuffs.
BAILIFF (CONT’D)
If you please.
The deputies enter the room, and start loading household
goods onto a cart, furniture, silverware, books, anything
they can get their hands on.
MR. DICKENS
Gentlemen! Please! This is all a
misunderstanding. A circumstance of
great moment to me is to be decided
in the ensuing term —
Young Charles bursts into tears.
YOUNG CHARLES
Tell them to stop. Tell them to
stop!
A handcuffed Mr. Dickens is helpless to comfort him. As he
struggles to reach Charles, he knocks the magic lantern and
it falls, shattering on the ground.

DICKENS
Four wood cuts and four etchings.
The cover in red. Hand-coloured.
The title in rustic writing. The
end papers to be green and all
three edges to be gilded.
LEECH
Gilded? That will cost you.
DICKENS
It must be exquisite. That’s why we
came to you.
LEECH
You’ll have to sell every copy to
make your money back.
DICKENS
That is my intention, Mr. Leech.
Leech purses his lips together.
LEECH
Have you brought the manuscript?
DICKENS
I’ll have something for you in a

LEECH
A week? That leaves only four weeks
to do the illustrations and get it
to the printers in time for
Christmas.
DICKENS

A theatre curtain is pulled aside to reveal a puppet show,
performing to a watching crowd in the COVERED market. All is
bustle and colour.
Dickens wanders amongst the stalls overflowing with brightly
coloured goods, tin pans, second-hand clothes, baskets of
chestnuts, pears and apples, piles of filberts.
Suddenly, a figure is there, tugging on his sleeve. It’s
Scrooge.

Dickens, a hand pops out of it, and thrusts a flyer in his

version of Henry) are seated round a table, staring joyfully
at a very modest Christmas dinner of mashed potatoes, apple
sauce, gravy, and a very small roasted goose.

lamp aloft, poses uncomfortably while Dickens applies makeup

EXT. LONDON/HATCHARD’S - NIGHT

Dickens is stopped outside of Hatchard’s. In the store window
a sign advertises “A New Christmas Book by Mr. Dickens. Order
Now and Avoid Disappointment.” Dickens peers through the
window lost in thought.
Suddenly, a POSSE of Characters from the book appears behind
him, Scrooge amongst them, staring in at the window.
SCROOGE
(to Cratchit)
In stores by Christmas? That will
be a miracle.
The posse sniggers.
Go away.

DICKENS

SCROOGE
Three flops in a row. Up to your
eyeballs in debt. I’d think you’d
be glad of some advice.
The POSSE nods in agreement.
DICKENS
All right. I’ve had a few flops,
what of it? I’m still young. It’s
not as if I--

Suddenly the surrounding area falls into darkness as the gas
lamps dim one by one. Scrooge turns pale as shadows take over
the street. Dickens turns to see the POSSE and SCROOGE
staring at a dark STATUE across the road.
Slowly the statue comes to life, its robes float eerily in
the wind, giving form to a terrifying Phantom, its face
obscured by a hood. (The GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET-TO-COME).
Dickens and Scrooge exchange fearful looks.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
Are we in the presence of the Ghost
of Christmas Yet to Come?
The Spirit nods.
SCROOGE
(to Dickens)
Why doesn’t he speak?
DICKENS
Shhh.
(to Ghost)
You are here to show us the shadows
of the things that have not
happened but will happen, is that
so?
The Spirit slowly raises a shrouded arm and points down the
street, the giant shadow of its finger comes to a stop at a
small door.
SCROOGE
(whispering to Dickens)
Where does it want us to go?
DICKENS
I think I know.
With that he heads towards the door, SCROOGE and the POSSE
following.
SCROOGE
I have a bad feeling about this.
DICKENS (O.S.)
They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s
house and found the mother and the
children seated round the fire.

Mrs. Cratchit and the children, dressed in black, huddle
together by the fire. Tiny Tim is not among them. We see his
lonely crutch leaning against the fireplace.

DICKENS (V.O.)
Then Bob came in the door.
MRS. CRATCHIT
You went today, then Robert? To the
cemetery?
Cratchit struggles to be cheerful as he enters the room.
CRATCHIT
Yes, my dear. I wish you could have
gone to see how green a place it
is. But you’ll see it often. I
promised him that I would walk
there on a Sunday.
He smiles through his tears.
CRATCHIT (CONT’D)
My little child. My little, little
child!
His voice cracks and he covers his eyes.
Oh no!

Tara has been listening to the story, her eyes wide with
emotion.
TARA
Is Tiny Tim dead?

Of course he is. Imbecile.

Scrooge rolls his eyes.

He’s been this way for a long time.
I’m not sure he can change.
TARA
Of course he can. He’s not a
monster.
DICKENS

Dickens stares at them a moment, now plagued with doubt.

Inside the noisy, squalid factory, Young Charles is led by a
Foreman to a score of pale-faced, miserable-looking CHILDREN,
all of them busy pasting labels on bottles or packing them in
casks.
FOREMAN
Boys. This here is Charlie Dickens.
And what was it you was just
telling me, lad? About your Dad?
Young Charles draws himself up proudly.
YOUNG CHARLES
My father is a gentleman.
The boys jeer. Young Charles flushes with embarrassment.
One of the boys, POLL, calls out.
POLL
Where is he, then? Dining with the
queen?
Another boy calls out.
BOY
I ‘eard he’s in the stone jug.
FOREMAN
Hush, you lot. Where’s your

The Foreman addresses him with elaborate politeness.
FOREMAN (CONT’D)
Master Dickens. Perhaps you would
be so good as to join us at work?
If you’ve nothing better to do?
The Foreman thrusts him down hard onto the work bench. Young
Charles looks around, miserable, at his surroundings.
FOREMAN (CONT’D)
No shirking here.
A rat scuttles nearby, to reveal a sheer drop to the giant
blacking VATS below. Poll sits down beside him and hisses at
him.

Dickens sits at his desk. He looks at the clock. It’s the
middle of the night. He once again goes through his ritual of
straightening everything on his desk.
He tidies his manuscript, picks up his pen, dips it in ink,
then stares at the paper.
There is a racket in the hallway outside the door.
MR. DICKENS (O.S.)
'Tis now the very witching time of
night,
MRS. DICKENS (O.S.)
Shhh, dear.
Mr. and Mrs. Dickens are in the hallway outside the door.
MR. DICKENS (O.S.)
When churchyards yawn and hell
itself breathes out—
Scrooge appears.
SCROOGE
Shakespeare. Now there’s a man who
could write. I doubt he ever had a

MR. DICKENS (O.S.)
Now could I drink hot blood!
Dickens grips his hair in frustration.
SCROOGE
(egging dickens on)
Self-preservation is the first law
of nature. That’s just a fact.
Dickens throws open the door to find Mr. Dickens, drunkenly
negotiating the stairs with the help of Mrs. Dickens.
MRS. DICKENS
That’s right dear. Just a few more

Mrs. Dickens is a little afraid of her son.
MRS. DICKENS
We’ll get him straight into bed,
Charles, dear. We were up the river
to Kew and I think perhaps it was
too long a day.
DICKENS
Kew! What about your newspaper
article?
Article?

MR. DICKENS

DICKENS
The one you’re writing on the Bank
Charter Act? It’s been over a
month.
Mr. Dickens shifts, uncomfortably.
MR. DICKENS
Oh, that. As it happens, the editor
was not able to— that is to say—
due to pecuniary involvements of a
complicated nature— he found it
necessary to— to cancel the
commission.
DICKENS
So. No newspaper article.
MR. DICKENS
However, I rejoice to say that I
have every hope of something
turning up —
Dickens sees Scrooge hovering behind him, scowling.

No-one is useless in this world who

In the room, the characters (including Cratchit, Mr. and Mrs.

knitting or doing the crossword. Dickens picks up a pen, and

Candle/scandal... flirt/hurt...

You look terrible. Is something

It’s the book. I’m having trouble

DICKENS (CONT’D)
Several of them, actually.

What exactly is the problem?
Dickens picks away at Forster’s dinner.

The problem is, could a man as meanspirited, as evil as Scrooge— could
he become a different person
overnight?
FORSTER
What is so evil about him?
DICKENS
Well, he’s a miser.
FORSTER
That doesn’t make him evil. It just
makes him cheap.

No, but he worships money. It’s the

You knew, when you married me, what
I was like: how ideas take

KATE
I did. But you don’t know what it’s
like to live with you, always
walking on eggshells, trying to
guess your mood, to know which of
your commands is a whim and which
is in earnest. Sometimes I think
your characters matter more to you
than your own flesh and blood.
DICKENS
I am who I am.
KATE
And who is that? It’s as if there
are two of you, Charles. One that

self, that no-one is allowed to

FLASHBACK:

INT. WARREN’S BLACKING FACTORY - DAY

83

Young Charles is sitting at his bench, looking frail. His
clothes are torn and dirty. His eyes are hollow. A ragged
cough shakes his body.
Young Charles chants to himself, to keep from crying.
YOUNG CHARLES
Blood of iron, heart of ice. Blood
of iron, heart of ice. ...
POLL (O.S.)
Got a present for the young
gent’lmun. Seeing as it’s
Christmas.
Young Charles, open his eyes to see one of the older boys,
POLL, approaching, hands behind his back. In a sudden
movement, he flings a DEAD RAT at him.
The other boys laugh.
With a howl of rage, Young Charles launches himself at Poll.
But Poll easily pushes him away.
POLL (CONT’D)
You’re no better than me, cocker,
and you know it.
The other boys gather round to cheer as Poll commences
pummelling Young Charles.

EXT. WARRENS BLACKING FACTORY

Dickens stands outside decrepit Warren’s Blacking Factory.
Slowly, fearfully, he pulls a board off a door and peers
inside.

INT. WARREN’S BLACKING FACTORY - NIGHT

86

Dickens walks through the dusty, abandoned warehouse,
remembering.
In his imagination, he hears the SOUNDS of SQUEAKING RATS. Of
boys LAUGHING.
In the basement, he finds a low bench beneath the window on
which are a few dusty POTS OF SHOE-BLACKING.
Scrooge materializes behind him holding a lamp.
SCROOGE
‘ello, Charlie.
Dickens turns to see him.
SCROOGE (CONT’D)
So. This is your miserable secret.
The famous author, the inimitable
Charles Dickens, was once a scabby
little factory boy.
DICKENS
Leave me be.
SCROOGE
A common bit of riffraff, living on
scraps, a squalid wretch of no
worth to anyone—
Dickens lunges at Scrooge, grabbing at thin air, he falls to
the ground, his face reflected across a broken mirror lying
on the floor. Scrooge looms over Dickens.

SCROOGE (CONT’D)
Look! What do you see there? Hmm? A
nothing. A nobody. A debtor’s son.
Who could ever care for you?
Certainly not your father. He
abandoned you.
Dickens struggles to his feet, putting distance between him
and Scrooge.
DICKENS
He didn’t -- he -- It wasn’t his
fault.
A rotten railing blocking his path. Dickens looks down at a
sheer drop into a huge empty blacking vat below. The railing
gives way, the squeal of a thousand rats disturbed by the
falling woodwork.
SCROOGE
He failed you. Again and again. You
said it yourself. Nothing but a
drag and chain upon your life.
Dickens turn to look at the fall below. Dickens looks at
Scrooge in horror.

DICKENS
Who are you?
Scrooge advances on him, holding his lamp high, forcing
Dickens to back up against the sheer drop.
SCROOGE
You know me, Charlie. I’m hunger.
I’m cold. I’m darkness.... I’m the
shadow on your thoughts, the crack
in your heart, the stain on your
soul... And I will never leave you.
Dickens holds up his hands as if to block Scrooge’s words.
Go away.

DICKENS

SCROOGE
But we’re having such fun. (beat)
People don’t change, Charlie.
DICKENS
They can. They do.

SCROOGE
Lies. Look around. You’re still
that scabby boy. No use to anyone.
Just like your father.
DICKENS
(enraged)
No...
Dickens take a sharp breath in. His eyes blaze.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
“No one is useless in this world
who lightens the burden of
another.”
Eh?

SCROOGE

DICKENS
(emboldened)
My father taught me that.
Scrooge turns to see an empty grave, with a blank HEADSTONE
in the middle of the warehouse floor. Scrooge nervously edges
towards it.
SCROOGE
(confused)
Whose grave it that? There’s no
name on the headstone.
DICKENS
Why should there be? The man to
whom this grave belongs never made
himself useful to anyone but
himself. No friends. No family.
Never felt love, or joy, or took
any kind of pleasure in life...
It’s time. Mr. Scrooge. We’ve come
to the end-Scrooge unnerved, turns back to Dickens only to see an earth
wall where Dickens was stood.
Turning again and then again he realizes he is surrounded by
earth walls. Looking up he sees the blank headstone. He
realizes he is now inside the empty grave. Dickens appears
above, framed by the blacking factory ceiling.
Suddenly the walls of the grave start closing in on Scrooge.
SCROOGE
Please. - I- don’t want to die like
this, alone, unloved, forgotten.

SCROOGE
Never too late! Oh, never too late.
Please. I’ll change.
The grave walls keep closing.
SCROOGE (CONT’D)
—- I will honour Christmas in my
heart, and try to keep it all the
year. I will live in the Past, the
Present and the Future. I will not
shut out the lessons that they
teach.
He looks directly at Dickens, imploring him.
SCROOGE (CONT’D)
Give me another chance. I beg you.
Let me do some good before I die.
The walls stop closing, a beat, then they start opening.
Scrooge is delighted, laughing, crying as the walls pull
back. He smiles, genuinely transformed. Dickens smiles back.
DICKENS
And so we come to the last chapter.
Somewhere, a church bell CHIMES twelve o’clock. Dickens looks
around, shocked to discover that the warehouse is empty and
he is all alone. He lets out a sharp breath.

He enters taking a deep, steadying breath, then goes over to
his desk and pulls out a new sheet of paper. He writes:
“Stave Five: The End of It.”

INT. DICKENS STUDY

- EARLY MORNING

89

Early morning light filters in through the windows as Dickens
bends over his writing, his pen SCRATCHING AWAY:
DICKENS (V.O.)
Scrooge was better than his word.
He did it all and infinitely more;
and to Tiny Tim who did not die, he
was a second father. And so, as
Tiny Tim observed, God bless us
every one!... The End.
Dickens bundles up the manuscript and rushes downstairs.

Dickens looks at Kate.
KATE
Your father makes it his business

Tara hands him back his book, Aladdin.
TARA
Thank you for the loan.
DICKENS
Did you like it?
Tara brightens.
TARA
Oh, yes, sir. It was fizzing.
This delights Dickens.

DICKENS
Fizzing! Delightful. You must read
Robinson Crusoe next.
Tara looks at him, in surprise.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
Tara. I’m sorry for sending you
away. It was a mistake. Will you
stay?
Tara nods, moved. Dickens smiles.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
And by the way, you were right
about Tiny Tim. He doesn’t die.
Scrooge helps him to get better.
TARA
Of course. And doesn’t he help
Scrooge get better, too?
DICKENS
He does. He does, indeed.
Dickens looks at the mantelpiece, where a magic lantern is
sitting.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
Where did that come from?
KATE
A gift. For the children. From your
father.
DICKENS
He was here?
KATE
You can still catch him if-Dickens hesitates, then stuffs the manuscript into his jacket
as he rushes towards the door, turns around abruptly, grabs
Kate and kisses her.
Kate--

DICKENS

KATE
I know, you don’t deserve me. Go.
He rushes out of the house.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

Outside the station, Dickens’ cab pulls up. He jumps out and
dashes past an enterprising VENDOR who is attempting to
interest the passersby in his selection of “Christmas trees”.
VENDOR
...the very latest, the same as
what’s in the Queen’s own drawing
room...

Dickens enters the station and sees his father and mother on
the platform about to get on the train. He leaps over the
barrier and runs towards them.
CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
Last call. All aboard.
Stop!

DICKENS

A CONSTABLE sees him and blows his whistle.
Stop!

CONSTABLE

Mr. and Mrs. Dickens, just getting on the train, turn to see
their son running along the platform.
DICKENS
What do you think you are doing?
MRS. DICKENS
Please, dear. Don’t make a scene.
We’re going away.
DICKENS
Oh, no you don’t.
Hi! You!

CONSTABLE

Mr. Dickens sees the Constable, rushing to catch up to them.
MR. DICKENS
What have I done?
DICKENS
Done? It’s what you haven’t done.
Mrs. Dickens flinches.

I don’t understand—
Dickens laughs, a touch maniacally.
DICKENS
Who is going to carve the turkey?
(to his mother)
Who is going to make the Christmas
pudding? It won’t be the same
without you?
Mrs. Dickens softens.
MRS. DICKENS
Oh, the pudding. The secret is to
warm the treacle first.
Mr. Dickens turns to his wife.
MR. DICKENS
There you see, my dear? I told you
something would turn up.
MRS. DICKENS
(through tears)
You did, you did.
Dickens laughs again, joyfully. He embraces them warmly.
The Constable has finally caught up with them. His eyes widen
in astonishment.
CONSTABLE
You’re that Charles Dickens.
Guilty.

CONSTABLE
I’m a huge fan.
Thank you.

Dickens waits nervously. He straightens at the sight of
Forster, making his way through the crowded room. Finally, he
arrives at the table.
DICKENS
Well? For God’s sake man, don’t
prolong the agony.
Forster pulls out a package, wrapped in gold paper and tied
with a bright red ribbon and hands it to Dickens.
Dickens opens it carefully. Inside is the book. The cover is
red, the title stamped in gold: A Christmas Carol, By Charles
Dickens. Dickens handles it with awe, turning the pages
slowly.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
It’s exactly as I’d imagined it.
THACKERAY (O.S.)
Hello, gents. Extraordinary
weather, isn’t it? Looks like snow.

Through the parlour windows we see the first Christmas
snowfall. The gleaming new chandelier takes pride of place
next to a Christmas tree as a splendid party is underway.
Fanny, Henry Sr. and Junior are there, watching as Mr.
Dickens, dressed as a conjuror, does some magic tricks for
Tara and the children. Mrs. Dickens chatters away to an
uncomprehending Signor Mazzini. Mrs. Fisk has been into the
punch.
MRS. FISK

Kate appears.
KATE
Good heavens, what is that?
DICKENS
The Germans call it a Tannenbaum.
Now that the royal family has one,
it’s going to be all the rage.
Grip, the raven, flies onto a branch and eyes Mrs. Fisk.
GRIP
Halloa, old girl. Halloa.
Forster arrives, a blushing Charlotte in tow.

DICKENS
Not now please, Forster...
FORSTER
(ignoring charles)
“It was a blessed inspiration that
put such a book into the head of
Charles Dickens...a happy
inspiration of the heart, that
warms every page. It is impossible
to read without a glowing bosom and
burning cheeks, between love and
shame of our kind....”
The group applauds. Smiling, Dickens holds up a glass of
punch:
DICKENS
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls.
He smiles at Kate.
DICKENS (CONT’D)
...and those on the way. A toast: I
wish you all many merry
Christmases, friendships, great
accumulation of cheerful
recollections and heaven at last
for all of us.
At that moment, Grip sees an opportunity and flies up the
staircase towards Dickens’ study. We follow him...
