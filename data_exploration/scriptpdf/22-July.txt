MOTHER UTØYA
So welcome to the first seminar for
today. We are going to do an
exercise, which I have called ‘If I
were Prime Minister.’ One of the
good things about Utøya is that you
can meet friends, and you can play
music and maybe stay up a bit
late... Yeah?
Laughter in the crowd.
MOTHER UTØYA (CONT’D)
But it’s also an opportunity to
think about your future. You grow
up so fast, and one day it will be
you who will be the leader of your
community. Viljar, can you start?
VILJAR
Yeah, sure...
VILJAR laughs and then goes up to the stage.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
So let’s see... OK, so in Svalbard
where I come from, everyone is
welcome, regardless of nationality.
We’ve got Norwegians, Russians,
Chinese, Croatians. All living and
working together. And we work
really hard to integrate everyone.
AUF MEMBER 1
But in Svalbard it’s only like two
thousand people, how do you
translate that to the rest of
Europe?
VILJAR
It’s the principle. Thats what’s
important and if I was Prime
Minister, that’s what I’d stand
for.

OK.

CHRISTIN

TRAUMA SURGEON
So I needed to do emergency surgery
on him. It was complex. There are
several bullet fragments close to
his brain stem.
SVEINN
But what - what does this mean?

That means that if he survives, we
will have to perform another
surgery. But his condition is
critical.

PRIME MINISTER
... and aluminum nitrate, and there
were no red flags?
HEAD OF PST
Our focus has been on Islamist
terror.
PRIME MINISTER
But we know the Far-Right is
growing fast.
SECURITY OFFICIAL LARS
We can’t stop every threat. We did
the best we could, Sir.
PRIME MINISTER
We all know that this is not good
enough.
(beat)
I want to upgrade our national
security. Intelligence. Defence.
Policing. Everything. And I’m
ordering a public inquiry. An
inquiry into what happened and how
we responded. Something went badly
wrong. And we need to find out
what. It’s the only way we’ll get
through this.

TRAUMA SURGEON
(shakes their hands)
Nice to see you. I just came from
the operating room. And I’m sorry
that I don’t bring better news than
this. I tried to get the bullet
fragments out, and I managed to
take some of them out... but not
all. Some of them were too close to
his brain stem. It would have been
too dangerous unfortunately.
SVEINN
So it’s ...if he wakes up now, he’s
not the same as he was?
TRAUMA SURGEON
To evaluate his brain injury, we
have to wait and see if he wakes
up. It’s up to him now. But we are
trying to do everything to save
Viljar’s life.

Thank you.

Boxes of police evidence on the table. LIPPESTAD, VIBEKE DEF.
LAWYER, and TWO ASSISTANTS leaf through files.
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER (V.O.)
It was a very dysfunctional family.
Breivik’s parents split
acrimoniously when he was very
young.
Insert: LIPPESTAD looks at ABB’s SOCIAL SERVICES FILES.
VIBEKE DEF LAWYER
She wrote to Social Services asking
for help. They had serious doubts
about his mother’s capacity to
parent.
LIPPESTAD
And his father?
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER
After the marriage collapsed, his
father cut him off.
LIPPESTAD
What about his half-sister?
Insert: LIPPESTAD looks at a photo of YOUNG BREIVIK.
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER
She emigrated to California. When
he was about 16 I think.
LIPPESTAD
16? 17?… Yeah ok… Thank you.

59.
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER
It was just him and his mother
after that.
Insert: LIPPESTAD looks at photos of TEENAGE BREIVIK.
LIPPESTAD
So he was obviously very isolated
all the way into adulthood.
LIPPESTAD ASSISTANT 2
Not exactly the picture he painted.
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER
No, no it’s not.
INSERT: LIPPESTAD opens a file of crime scene photos. Photos
of DEAD BODIES.
LIPPESTAD
So what are we talking about here?
Developing insanity as a defense?
LIPPESTAD ASSISTANT 2
I think so.
VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER
How else do we explain it?
LIPPESTAD looks back at the desperate photos. Closes the

Yes.

LIPPESTAD
Now I know he doesn’t have a
relationship with his father. So I
wanted to ask you some questions.
What was Anders like as a child?
BREIVIK’S MOTHER
Oh he was a normal boy. Kind,
clever. Lots of friends. He loved
affection. Since his father left
up, I was a single parent.
LIPPESTAD
Any mental health issues?
No.

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

LIPPESTAD
Was he ever violent?
Never.

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

LIPPESTAD
Did he ever have any dealings with
social services?
BREIVIK’S MOTHER
After his father left, I thought I
needed their help, but I didn’t. He
was fine.
He sees her hands shaking. She’s on the edge.
LIPPESTAD
And did you have any sense recently
that Anders was having problems?
No.

BREIVIKS MOTHER

(beat)
I told the police that I saw he had
guns in his bedroom. But he told me
he needed them for hunting. And I
believed him.
LIPPESTAD
Would you consider testifying in
Anders’ defense?
BREIVIKS MOTHER
What would I say?

61.
LIPPESTAD
Just that there were problems, in
his childhood. It would help him.
BREIVIK’S MOTHER
But then everyone will know who I
am.
LIPPESTAD
Anders is entitled to a defense,
just like everyone else.
BREIVIKS MOTHER
(crying)
I can’t do it.
LIPPESTAD
(packing up)
Thank you for your time.
LIPPESTAD goes to the door.
BREIVIK’S MOTHER
He’s kind of right though, isn’t
he. The way the country’s going.
It’s not like it used to be.

GJORV (ON TV)

I have just met with the Prime
Minister. He has asked me to
conduct a searching and independent
inquiry into the attacks on 22
July. I have accepted and our work
will begin immediately. Thank you.
He wakes SIGNE.
As she gets up:
PRIME MINISTER (ON TV)
This public inquiry is of vital
importance. Whatever went wrong we
must confront it. If we fail to do
so, the terrorist will surely win.
SIGNE
Who was that?

SVEINN
That’s kind.

Hi, you ok?
TORJE
Hi. Yeah...
CHRISTIN
Do you know Viljar well?
LARA
I think everyone knows Viljar. I

TORJE
Yeah, he foaled you.

Yeah

LARA
(laughs)

SVEINN smiles. An awkward silence.
LARA (CONT’D)
But I will leave you.

LIPPESTAD
My recommendation is that you plead
insanity. The court will have you
assessed by psychiatrists. They
will give a diagnosis. And the
court will then decide whether to
accept it. If they do, you’ll go to
hospital for treatment.
Not jail?
Not jail.

BREIVIK
People will be very angry.

TRAUMA SURGEON
OK. That’s good news. I think we

I know. And there’s a difference.
DR. HUSBY
Do you think people can read your
mind?

BREIVIK
Sometimes. I think they try.
DR. HUSBY
Did you feel like that before the
attacks, or is it a new feeling?
BREIVIK
It’s not new. But it got worse when

...the Norwegians Anders Behring
Breivik who killed 77 people in
July is criminally insane. Breivik
who has admitted carrying out the
attacks in Oslo and on Utoya Island
has been diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia that developed over a
long period of time... The
psychiatric evaluation may mean
that he will not be sent to prison.
VILJAR turns a corner. Comes face-to-face with BREIVIK on the

TV REPORTER
According to his critics, Prime
Minister Stoltenberg has been
accused of wasting a once in a
lifetime economic boom. His Labour
Party is still predicting to win
the most votes, but polls suggest
overall power will go to a
coalition of centre-right parties.
In many ways it’s a peculiar shift.
One change Norwegians may get as a
result of this election is the
Progress Party. It’s a populist
anti-immigration movement that masskilled Anders Breivik used to be a

I know it’s very unlikely, but we

Hi Anders.

LIPPESTAD

BREIVIK
I want to change my plea.
What?

LIPPESTAD

BREIVIK
I’m not insane. I was playing a
role.
What role?

LIPPESTAD

83.
BREIVIK
I was playing the monster in a
nightmare. But I’m not a monster.
I’m a soldier in a war, doing my
duty. A leader. And a leader does
not give away his power. I’ve
allowed the families to take
control, but this is my trial. I
decide how it ends. I have to prove
these attacks meant something.
LIPPESTAD
You’ll go to prison. For the rest
of your life.
BREIVIK
I have to finish what I’ve started.
And standing up in the court.
That’s the third attack. That’s the
whole point of this. That’s why I
surrendered. That is how I win.

He wants to stay in control.
VIBEKE DEF LAWYER
And he knows the consequences?

84.
LIPPESTAD
He wants to stand up and be
accountable for his actions.
LIPPESTAD ASSISTANT 2
The psychiatric assessment was
clear. And the Prosecution are
legally obliged to stick with it.
So how do we get around that?
LIPPESTAD
Ok so we have to start again. And
show that he knew what he was
doing. Every step of the way. That
only someone rational could have
planned and executed something this
complex. And then we have to look
into the Far-Right. Find witnesses
who share his beliefs. So we can
show that he’s not alone in his
views. That’s the only way we can
do this.

SECOND DOCTOR
So Viljar, how are you?
VILJAR
My head hurts, all the time. My

SECOND DOCTOR
OK phantom pains are normal when
you have a serious head injury. The
bullet fragments are sitting deeply

stem, and if they move just the
slightest bit...
VILJAR

Did you ever meet him?

He asked. But I’m careful who I
work with. What I do. And he’s not

FAMILY LAWYER
The court has to preserve his
rights.
CHRISTIN enters and slips into the back as the argument
rages.
ANGRY FATHER
They are talking about the man who
killed my son! I would hang him
from a tree!
ANGRY PARENT 3
He shouldn’t be allowed to turn
this trial into propaganda!
FAMILY LAWYER
I agree, I agree, and I’m going to
be there to make sure that doesn’t
happen. We are closing the trial
with victims’ testimonies. That’s
why it’s important that those who
survived speak about their
experience to stand up against his
defense. I think it will be a very
very strong statement.
ANGRY PARENT 3
He gets to speak? My daughter’s too
scared to leave her bedroom!
ANGRY MOTHER
What about my daughter’s voice?!

They will be the voices of those
who cannot speak. Because they were
there. And we need to hear their

assassination in Europe since World

I want to begin to explore to what
extent Government was aware of the
threat posed by Anders Behring
Breivik prior to his attacks on
22nd of July.
PRIME MINISTER
That was obviously a question that
concerned me greatly. The Security
Services told me they had no
warnings. That he operated
completely out of sight.
GJORV
Prime Minister, our investigation
suggests something different. We
have discovered that Mr. Breivik’s
purchase of chemicals that he used
in the construction of the bomb
came to the attention of the
customs services in January 2011.
But this was not acted on.
PRIME MINISTER
That was not what I was told, Madam
Chair.
GJORV
Can we turn now to the issue of
physical security around the
Government Quarters? You can turn
to tab 3.

It appears from the papers there
were proposals discussed inside

Minister’s Office.

Mr. Breivik, the police have

It was a covert meeting.

There is a calmness. A serenity to
him.
RADIO REPORTER 3 (V.O.)
When he first walked in, and I

he does. This courtroom was built

go than let him hear that.
SVEINN
Then what is it you want?

VILJAR
I want to smash him into a bloody
pulp. I want to smash his fucking

there who support me. And this is
the best you can do?
LIPPESTAD
He was the only one.
BREIVIK
I’m a commander in the Knight’s
Templar Europe.
(beat)
What about my mother? She could say
I was normal.
LIPPESTAD
She won’t do it either.
See BREIVIK. This lands.
BREIVIK
Pathetic. You know there’s not once
when I could rely on her. Not even
once.
LIPPESTAD
Anders, there’s not one single
person who will agree to defend
your actions.

110.
BREIVIK
I don’t need anyone.

EXT. SVALBARD - DAWN
VILJAR walking up hill. One foot in front of the other.
Behind him: the endless snows of Svalbard.
CUT TO:
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 6

- SAME TIME

LARA
We were refugees. We were running
from war. It took a long time for
Norway to feel like home. And some
people were suspicious of us. They
were angry that we were even here.
LIPPESTAD looks at BREIVIK. No reaction.
LARA (CONT’D)
But my sister Bano, she really
helped me. She told me that Norway,
Norway’s great. It could mean
security for us, and freedom, and
hope. And that exactly what I felt
around the campfire on Utøya. The
night before.
(pauses)
But the next day, when we were
attacked - and when my sister died I just lost all that...
CUT TO:
INT. SVALBARD. VILJAR'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
VILJAR watches Lara’s testimony on TV.
LARA (V.O.)
I just had to live in a world of
pain and fear. And so much anger...
CUT TO:

111.
INT. COURTROOM - SAME TIME
LARA
And I-sorry...
(holding back her tears)
I’ve just been feeling so guilty. I
just keep on wondering how did I
live when she died? And how do I
face my parents? And what do I say
to my brother? And I just couldn’t
understand why anyone would want to
kill us.
(beat)
I don’t understand what’s so
frightening about me.
See BREIVIK, no reaction.
Thank you.

LARA (CONT’D)

You OK?

LARA

VILJAR
Yeah, I’ll be fine.
LARA
It’s nearly over.
VILJAR
(covering)
Definitely.
(beat)
Look. I’m sorry I got lost. The
last few months. I just...
LARA
It’s OK. So did I.
They walk on.

113.
VILJAR
How close is he? I couldn’t tell
from the TV.
LARA
(holds her hands apart)
He’s really close.
See VILJAR.
LARA (CONT’D)
You don’t have to look at him, if
you don’t want to.
(beat)
Do you know what you’re going to
say?
VILJAR
I’ve tried to think of things, but
I get confused. I just don’t want
to be weak. That’s all. Not in
front of him.
LARA
You can be weak and still strong,
you know that right.
See VILJAR. They hug.
LARA (CONT’D)
You’re going to be great.
Thanks.

VILJAR

LARA
I should get back. See you
tomorrow.
VILJAR
See you tomorrow.

His PARENTS watching. LARA too.
JUDGE ARTNZEN
Please, sit down Viljar.
VILJAR sits.
Looks up at BREIVIK.

116.
Who’s looking right at him.
VILJAR looks away.
FAMILY LAWYER
Can you tell us what happened to
you on Utøya, Viljar?
Yes.

VILJAR

(begins to remember)
He tried to... He tried to kill me.
I remember seeing him. And running
away. Trying to find somewhere to
hide. And protecting my little
brother. And I remember being shot.
(using his right hand)
Five times. When I was lying on the
beach. I was... all alone. In a
kind of pain I couldn’t imagine.
BREIVIK looks up momentarily. Catches VILJAR’s eye.
FAMILY LAWYER
But you’re here now.
VILJAR steels himself, keeping his emotion at bay.
VILJAR
But everything is different. I’ve
had to relearn how to use my body.
Learn to walk again, how to feed
myself again. I have little use of
my left arm. And I’m blind in one
eye - but that’s... that’s a
relief.
PROSECUTION
A relief? How do you mean?
VILJAR
A relief. A relief in that at least
now I don’t have to look at him.
Sudden laughter. Breaking the spell. BREIVIK looks around the
room. Sees EVERYONE laughing. Can’t help but smile himself.
And VILJAR sees it. Knows he’s got through. LIPPESTAD sees
too.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
But of course it’s not that simple,
I have a fragment of his bullet
lodged in my brain, that could kill
me at any time.

117.
His voice falters.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
And I don’t look like the person I
used to anymore. My body. It’s
broken... And the worst is that
he...
(begins to cry)
Killed Anders and Simon. My best
friends. Stopping them from making
their mark on the world. They would
have made it a better place. And I
miss them every day.
VILJAR stops, swallowing back his pain, trying to keep
control. Head down. EVERYONE watching him.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I didn’t want to cry. I
so much didn’t want to cry in front
of him. I wanted to stay strong.
Because I do this for them. So they
will not be forgotten.
VILJAR looks right at BREIVIK. Tears, but an unwavering
stare.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
When he shot them and left me alone
on the beach, I didn’t know if I
was living or dying. And I’ve been
stuck there ever since.
On BREIVIK, looking right back at him.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
But now I realise that I got a
choice. Because I still have
family. And friends. And memories.
And dreams. Hope. And love.
(beat)
And he doesn’t. He’s completely
alone. And he’s going to rot in
prison, whereas I...
(beat)
I survived and I choose to live.
And at that moment, BREIVIK looks away. And VILJAR sees it.
VILJAR knows he’s won and BREIVIK knows it too.
VILJAR (CONT’D)
(to the JUDGE)
I’m done.

118.

Hi.

PRIME MINISTER

(tearful)
It’s good to see you.

PRIME MINISTER (CONT’D)
Thank you for meeting me. First of
all, I want to say, I’m sorry.
His voice breaks.
PRIME MINISTER (CONT’D)
We should have done better. I
should have done better.
For a moment there is silence.

119.
MOTHER
We all think that the
responsibility lies with the
terrorist. Only him. Not you.
See the PM, stunned by her grace.
JUDGE ARTNZEN (V.O.)
The verdict is unanimous...
CUT TO:

The court finds Anders Behring
Breivik guilty of all charges. And
we judge him accountable for his
actions. Anders Behring Breivik is
therefore sentenced to indefinite
solitary confinement. For as long
as he remains a threat to society.

BREIVIK
Do you think you will you visit me?
LIPPESTAD
I don’t think so, Anders.
BREIVIK
So we’re done.
LIPPESTAD
Yes. My job is finished.
BREIVIK holds out his hand. LIPPESTAD doesn’t take it.
As stands and he reaches the door:
BREIVIK
Geir? I’d do it all again if I
could.
LIPPESTAD stops. Turns to face him.
LIPPESTAD
You didn’t win, Anders. You failed.
BREIVIK
(beat and then)
There will be others. To finish
what I have started.
LIPPESTAD
We will beat you. My children, and
their children. They will beat you.
BREIVIK
You can’t even see us.
LIPPESTAD
Goodbye, Anders.
LIPPESTAD leaves.
BREIVIK sits for a moment and then stands to be taken away by
a GUARD.
