LOVE IS STRANGE
by
Mauricio Zacharias & Ira Sachs

INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT, BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
The early morning sun fights to get in the bedroom
through the edges of well drawn shades.
BENJAMIN HULL(”Ben”), early 70s, is in bed awake. Next to
him lies GEORGE GAREA, early 60s, turned on his side,
still asleep.
Ben is still. The only movement is in his eyes,
shimmering with expectation.
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT, BATHROOM - DAY
George, handsome, well groomed and with an impeccable
white shirt, is in front of the mirror tying the knot on
his tie. He tries once and, not happy with the result,
repositions the tie around his neck, and tries it again.
Voices can be heard in the background.
Ben enters dressed in a suit and a bow tie - the man has
style. He’s looking in the bathroom for something he
might have lost. He looks on top of a pile of magazines
by the toilet.
What?

GEORGE

BEN
My glasses. I can’t find my
glasses.
Ben looks around the sink where George is, briefly
interrupting his concentration with the tie.
GEORGE
Oh, no. Not today. Please.
Ben walks out, without his glasses. George hasn’t gotten
a good knot on his tie yet.
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
ZLATA, the housekeeper, Polish and in her 40’s, comes in
from the kitchen bringing a big vase of flowers, which
she places on the coffee table.
The living room is spacious, high ceilings, comfortable
furniture. There’s a piano in the corner, art on the
wall, a dining table for 6 people and an umbrella holder
by the front door.

(CONTINUED)

2.
CONTINUED:
Ben is rearranging books and objects around, while
looking for his glasses. EUGENIA, early 30’s, ZLATA’s
pretty younger sister, is dusting off the book shelves.
She finds a pair of reading glasses - EUGENIA speaks with
a heavy Polish accent.
EUGENIA
I find Mr. Ben.
Ben comes to look.
BEN
Yes! Thank you, sweetie. Where’s
the list?
EUGENIA
(in Polish)
Zlata, you have the list.
ZLATA
It’s in the kitchen.
Ben goes into the kitchen.
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT, KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Ben is reading a small list on a piece of paper. Zlata is
cutting up more flowers by the sink.
BEN
I think 40 will do. Maybe Eugenia
can go to the grocery for you?
Ben opens his wallet and realizes he only has a couple of
single dollar bills.
BEN (CONT’D)
And the lasagna?
ZLATA
I’ve just put it in the oven.
Ben can’t resist; he goes to take a peek inside the oven.
BEN
Looks delicious.
George comes in, in a suit and a tie, his face and hair
perfectly fresh.
Let me see.

GEORGE

(CONTINUED)

3.
CONTINUED:
He can’t resist and also goes to peek at the lasagna in
the oven.
BEN
(to George)
Honey, do you have any cash?
GEORGE
(to Zlata)
It’s not too early to be heating
this up?
ZLATA
Close the door! I know what I’m
doing.
Zlata slaps his hand. George closes the oven.
GEORGE
So how do I look?
Zlata opens a big smile and gives George a hug and a
kiss.
ZLATA
Fabulous. Both of you.
BEN
It’s almost eleven, George. We
have to go.
GEORGE
I’m waiting for you.
BEN
Sure. I need some cash for
Eugenia.
ZLATA
You smell so good too.
George takes out his wallet.
Thank you.

GEORGE

Before George can ask how much, Ben grabs two 20 dollar
bills and leaves them on the counter. George is used to
these kind of dynamics, and simply folds the wallet and
puts it back into his pocket.
BEN
Let’s go. Thank you Zlata.

(CONTINUED)

4.
CONTINUED: (2)
GEORGE
We’ll be back around 1:30.
BEN
Honey said she’d stop by before
the ceremony, but I don’t know
where she is.
GEORGE
(laughing)
Honey and her monsters.
ZLATA
It’s okay, I’m here.
INT. BENJAMIN & GEORGE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
(CONTINUOUS)
Eugenia is still cleaning. Ben looks around, moves the
vase of flowers on the table by a few inches.
BEN
Eugenia, I left some money with
Zlata for the things we still
need.
EUGENIA
Okay. I go to the grocery on 14th.
BEN
No. Go to the nicer one, the one
on 23rd. This is a special
occasion.
Ben gets the keys on the table and moves towards the
door.
BEN
Do you have the papers?
GEORGE
Yes. I have them. Let’s go.
EXT. STREETS OF CHELSEA - DAY
Ben and George are on the streets trying to catch a cab.
A couple of OCCUPIED ones rush by as George still tries
to convince them to stop.
BEN
We should’ve left earlier.

(CONTINUED)

5.
CONTINUED:
It’ll be okay.

GEORGE

George keeps waving as OFF DUTY or busy cabs fly by.
BEN
(impatient)
They’re full, George.
GEORGE
Let’s go to Seventh. Come on!
George starts to trot towards the Avenue.
Wait!

BEN

Ben tries to follow, but after a few fast steps, he is
too tired, or too old to run. He simply walks towards the
corner.
BEN
I don’t want to get all sweaty.

INT. 6BC BOTANICAL GARDEN - DAY

8

A lush community garden in the middle of the city,
surrounded by NYC buildings. Friends and family of all
ages are gathered for the ceremony, standing and sitting
in a small clearing to the side. The MARRIAGE OFFICIANT,
a very enthusiastic man in his 40’s, is standing in front
of the audience, with George and Ben next to his side,
smiling, paying attention to every word.
OFFICIANT
Welcome everybody, it’s really
wonderful to have all of you here
in this oasis in the middle of
Manhattan. And thank you George
and Ben for asking me to do this.
And thank you two for allowing me
to do this. I want you to know
that it’s an honor for me.
George dries out a few drops of sweat on his forehead
with a handkerchief.

CONTINUED:
OFFICIANT
And for everybody who’s here, I
would like to ask you to get rid
of everything that’s in your head
about anything else, and
concentrate only on this moment,
and the ceremony, and these two
people who we’re about to join
together.

Sitting on the chairs, in the audience, are Ben’s nephew
ELLIOT and his wife KATE, in their 40s. She reaches for
his hand.
OFFICIANT (O.S.)
Try to stop thinking about your
jobs, your marriage, your
schoolwork, what you have to do
tomorrow and what you forgot to do
today. Let’s just focus all our
energies, and all our love on
these two men here: George and
Ben.
A cell phone rings, with a cutting edge rap song,
interrupting the speech. There’s laughter all around.
Kate pokes her 15 year old son JOEY, who immediately
silences his iPhone.
OFFICIANT
I’d also like to ask the audience
here to be part of this ceremony
today. You are already a part of
the community that made this love
possible. You have made this
moment possible.
Right behind them is ROBERTO, dark skin, DomenicanAmerican, early 40’s. Sitting next to him is his partner
TED, a good looking all American man, early 30’s. And
HONEY (late 50s), an old friend of the couple’s, in an
elegant dress, conservative but also a touch glamorous.
Roberto shoots a picture with his phone, while Ted fights
a yawn - maybe from a sleepless night.
OFFICIANT
And so I ask all of you, if you
would commit to support and honor
these two individuals in their
life, and in their love, and in
their marriage together...

CONTINUED: (2)

George raises his eyes up above, as if silently thanking
God, as Ben, standing next to him, absorbs each word with
a smile.
OFFICIANT
...through the bad times and the
good times, through rain and
shine, in sickness and in
health...
There are a few other FRIENDS and COLLEAGUES, and last,
but not least, MINDY, Ben’s nervous looking older niece,
who’s already crying, next to her boyfriend JOHN, a
friendly looking man her own age.
OFFICIANT
Will you make that commitment
today?
Smiles all around. Honey has an enthusiastic response,
while Mindy raises both arms, sending good vibes. Roberto
raises his iPhone, registering the moment on filming
mode.
Yes!

ALL AUDIENCE

OFFICIANT
Now, under the training that we
get, there’s something I have to
ask, and the answer may seem
obvious but still, it is a very
important question: are both of
you making this decision of your
own free will?
Somebody in the audience laughs, and it’s contagious.
George looks at Ben, both wanting to laugh.
Yes.
Yes.

GEORGE
BEN

OFFICIANT
All right. We are gathered here in
the presence of these witnesses
today, with the purpose of uniting
in matrimony...
George reaches for Ben, and they hold each other’s hands
as they look in each other’s eyes, and smile.

OFFICIANT (O.S.)
...George Esteban Garea and
Benjamin Arthur Hull. Let me
remind you that the contract of
marriage is not to be entered into
lightly, but thoughtfully and
seriously and with a deep
realization of its obligations and
responsibilities...
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - DAY
The party is going. PIANO MUSIC can be heard in the
background. Honey walks around with a TRAY OF COOKIES.
HONEY
(with a deep Texas
accent)
Please, take one. I made them,
they’re delicious!

She goes around to the grand piano, where GUESTS are
gathered around George, who is playing and singing BABY
YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES.
GEORGE
(singing)
Well now it takes more than a
robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips for fire to
melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts that are
cookin' to make a fie grow
And baby you've got what it takes.
Ben sits next to George, sharing the piano seat and the
song - they sing very well together, very much in tune
with each other. It’s a delight to see.
BEN
You know it takes alot of kissin'
to make a romance sweet
Oh it takes alot of lovin' to make
my life complete
Oh well it takes somebedy special
to knock me off my feet
And baby you've got what it takes.
There’s laughter all around. George keeps on playing, and
the two sing together.

(CONTINUED)

9.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE & BEN
I said ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Aha ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Because it takes alot of effort to
stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime
to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to
make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes
C'mon say that again honey
You've got what it takes [x5]
George jazzes it up on the piano for a grand finale he’s a true musician. The guests applaud. The dogs bark.
Kate starts clinking her glass.
KATE
Guys, guys. Quiet everyone. Quiet!
I just wanted to say something-ROBERTO
(already tipsy)
Not now! Encore, guys, encore!
Ted discreetly pulls his shirt, trying to shush his
partner.
ROBERTO
This better be good.
KATE
(in good spirits)
It is. It is.
Everybody has quieted down now.
KATE
When I met my husband Elliot
here...
ELLIOT
Is there another one?
Laughter.

(CONTINUED)

10.
CONTINUED: (2)
KATE
When I met Elliot, you all know my
Elliot..., but when I met him, he
was walking around with a camera,
making these amazing videos with
people he met on the streets,
creating scenes out of the most
ordinary situations - I’m sure
you’ve all seen them. Anyway, I
was trying to finish my first
novel and I immediately thought
we’d be such a great pair: two
independent spirits, committed to
our art, but alas, he wouldn’t pay
any attention to me. He had no
time for romance. Actually, he had
no time to eat - he was always
hungry, so I started to invite him
over for left overs, which was
actually food I had made specially
for him... but he thought they
were leftovers. One day he called
and said he was starving, so I
told him to come over, but this
time I had no food - just a bottle
of wine, and that’s when he
finally started to pay attention
to me.
Laughter. Zlata and Eugenia come from the kitchen.
GEORGE
Zlata, Eugenia, come here, get
your glasses.
KATE
We started to go out, and one day
he said he wanted me to meet his
Uncle Ben. I asked why, and Elliot
said since his mother had passed
away, his uncle was his favorite
person in his family.
MINDY
Thank you, Elliot.
KATE
Not including siblings, Mindy.
Laughter.

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED: (3)
KATE
I said okay, let’s meet the uncle,
but I kept postponing, ‘cause I
didn’t want to meet anyone: I just
wanted to spend time alone with
Elliot. So finally we came here
one night - you guys had just
moved into this apartment, and I
met Ben, and George, who had made
a delicious spaghetti bolognese
for us, and we drank wine and sang
and drank some more - it was just
wonderful. When we left, Elliot
said: “I wanted you to meet them,
because they’ve been together for
more than 20 years...”. So I
understood...
Kate gets emotional, tears up.
KATE
Oh my God, I’m gonna cry.
Everybody is quiet, listening. Mindy starts to cry again,
but Kate swallows her tears. Elliot comes over and puts
his arm around his wife.
KATE
I understood at that moment that
Elliot was proposing to me...
(to Ben and George,
raising her glass)
because you guys... Your love,
your dedication and your
commitment to each other are an
example to be followed. May this
marriage, may this love, last
forever and beyond. To Ben and
George!
Everybody raise their glasses and toast.
EVERYBODY
To Ben and George!
And to Petra!
To Petra!

BEN
EVERYBODY

ELLIOT
To Petra Von Kant!

Ben and George, on the piano seat, look at each other and
kiss. Some applaud, some whistle, a noisy crowd.
FADE OUT.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL / AUDITORIUM - DAY
FATHER RAYMOND is sitting alone in the back of a large
auditorium where a choir rehearsal is taking place. His
eyes are closed, his head tilted down, as if in prayer.
In the background, the voices of the chorus sing the
powerful Miserere, by Allegri.
Up on stage, BOYS and GIRLS sing together, wearing their
own casual clothes, under a modern sculpture of Christ on
the cross. They sing in Latin; Tibi soli peccavi et
malum, coram te fecci: ut justificeris in sermonibus
tuis, et vincas cum judicaris (Having sinned against none
other than You, having done what You regard as wrong, You
are just when you pass sentence on me).
It’s a very democratic group: different ages, races and
attitudes. Each face has a story, and together they give
extraordinary power to the music.
In front of them, George conducts with passion for the
music, moving his arms, mouthing some of the words that
he knows by heart.
In the back of the auditorium, Father Raymond continues
to pray, invisible to the people on stage.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL / OFFICE - DAY
The small administrative office of Father Raymond. He is
reading from a piece of paper, a computer in front of
him.
FATHER RAYMOND
“All who serve in the Archdiocese
should: believe in God, support
belief in Jesus Christ, engage in
prayer, respect ecclesiastical
authority, possess a basic
knowledge of the Catholic Church,
not take a public position
contrary to the Catholic Church,
demonstrate a public life
consistent with the teachings of
the Catholic Church-George is sitting across his desk. Both men look tense.
(CONTINUED)

13.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
(interrupting)
Father. You’re not going to read
me the whole Witness Statement,
are you?
Father Raymond hands him the piece of paper.
FATHER RAYMOND
The Christian Witness Statement,
George. You signed it when you
took this job.
GEORGE
Father, how long have we known
each other?
FATHER RAYMOND
I wish I didn’t have to do this,
George.
GEORGE
Twelve years. Twelve years,
Father.
FATHER RAYMOND
You must understand that...
GEORGE
Understand what?
FATHER RAYMOND
That day when you announced you
were getting married, at the
spring semester meeting?
GEORGE
You’ve all known this whole time
that Ben and I have been living
together.
FATHER RAYMOND
Word got out to the Archdiocese.
And then someone showed the Bishop
pictures of you and Ben in Petra on Facebook, of all places.
GEORGE
I wouldn’t have done it any
differently, Father.
FATHER RAYMOND
I’m not saying you should have,
George. But the Bishop wasn’t
happy.
(CONTINUED)

14.
CONTINUED: (2)
GEORGE
What about the students? I’ve
known them since they were kids. I
know their parents. They’ve been
to my house, and played on my
piano. They’ve sung with Ben and
me.
FATHER RAYMOND
George, you understand I signed
the same Witness Statement, right?
We all did it here. Believe me: I
wish I didn’t have to do this, but
it’s not a choice for me.
GEORGE
I need to talk to the students.
FATHER RAYMOND
Of course. I could go talk to them
with you; or maybe you prefer to
go on your own? It’s up to you.
GEORGE
What about regionals next month?
Father Raymond picks up a print out email from his desk,
and reluctantly shows it to George.
FATHER RAYMOND
The decision is effective
immediately.
Oh.

GEORGE

George takes a moment to process what’s just happened.
Silence.
FATHER RAYMOND
Let’s pray, George.
George stands up, ready to leave.
FATHER RAYMOND (CONT’D)
It’s important that you don’t
question your faith.
GEORGE
Thank you, Father. I believe in
Jesus Christ as my savior, and
that won’t change. But at this
moment, I need to pray on my own.

15.
EXT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL - DAY
St. Grace’s Church and Catholic school in Manhattan.
The School and Church are located on a quiet street in
Chelsea, lined with trees, off the main avenue. There’s
barely any traffic. A small group of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
in school uniform hang out outside, chatting and smoking
cigarettes.
The door opens and out comes George, carrying a backpack
and a heavy shopping bag.
He passes by the students without saying a word.
It’s hot outside. George walks down the street alone,
sweating, passing the shopping bag from one hand to
another. Busy New Yorkers pass by him, not noticing he
has to stop for a moment, placing the heavy bag on the
ground, cleaning the sweat off of his face. After a
moment, he picks it up again, and continues on his way,
disappearing down a busy avenue.
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT
George is pacing nervously by the piano, holding a pen.
He uses an old fashioned calculator that’s on top of the
piano, as he scribbles something on a piece of paper.
GEORGE
Let’s not forget that the real
estate agent gets a first month
commission. The coop board gets
one month also, and charges a 5%
administration fee.
A month?

MINDY

Roberto, Ted, Honey, Mindy, Ben and Kate are sitting in
the living room. Roberto and Ted are both in police
uniforms. They drink soft drinks, water and beer for
Roberto and Ted, but this time, it’s definitely not a
party.
Yes.

GEORGE

MINDY
That’s ridiculous! Why do they
have to charge an administration
fee?

(CONTINUED)

16.
CONTINUED:
ROBERTO
They just want to discourage
rentals in the building.
I hate coop’s.

MINDY

HONEY
But it’s so hard to find a condo
in Manhattan.
TED
Nowadays it’s not.
GEORGE
Anyway, I’m just trying to explain
that renting wouldn’t help us,
because...
George is still finishing his calculations.
MINDY
You’ve been to my house, right?
You know how much my real estate
taxes are? 3000. That’s for the
whole year!
BEN
It’s Poughkeepsie, Mindy.
GEORGE
Renting would leave us owing about
a thousand a month. If we can find
a studio for 1,500 dollars, which
isn’t easy, we’d start our month
at almost 3,000. That’s including
the Cobra insurance.
KATE
And you can’t afford that?
GEORGE
Well, between my private lessons
and Ben’s pension...
George is interrupted by a knock on the door.
MINDY
Why did you guys have to go on
such a fancy honeymoon?
Ben gets up and walks towards the door.

(CONTINUED)

17.
CONTINUED: (2)
BEN
Mindy!! That’s none of your
business.
MINDY
Of course it is. Otherwise I
wouldn’t be here.
Shush, Mindy.

ROBERTO

MINDY
I’m just saying... there’s nothing
wrong with Provincetown.
Ben opens the door. It’s Elliot.
ELLIOT
Sorry I’m late.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Anyway, we’d still have to pay one
month’s rent to the agent and one
month to the coop board right
away. That’s 4,600 right there out
of our pockets.
BEN
Come in. We’re all in here.
Elliot seems surprised to see everybody there. He notices
the serious mood.
ELLIOT
Everything okay, Uncle?
BEN
Yes, we just want to talk to you.
George stands to greet him.
GEORGE
Sit down. We just want to talk to
you all. We invited you all here
tonight, because you are our
family.
BEN
Do you want something to drink?
Elliot goes to sit next to Kate. She gives him a kiss.

(CONTINUED)

18.
CONTINUED: (3)
ELLIOT
Water, please. Are you going to
tell us you’re getting divorced
already?
ROBERTO
Ha! That’s what I thought also.
GEORGE
No. We have to sell the apartment.
We’ve already found a buyer, so
very soon we’ll have to move out.
Ben returns with water for Elliot. He and George sit
together on the piano seat with their backs to the
instrument. They face their guests.
GEORGE
It won’t take long for me to find
another job, and for us to find an
apartment. But in the meantime...
BEN
It’s just for this transition
phase. Probably just a week or
two.
GEORGE
We need a place to stay.
Elliot looks around at the Guests, and at Ben and George.
Nobody says anything.
ELLIOT
Wait a minute. Did I miss
something?
BEN
The last weeks have been tough on
us, Elliot. Losing the job,
looking for health insurance... We
just need a breather.
GEORGE
Believe me, moving out is the last
thing we want to do.
BEN
And it’s just temporary. We’ll
find a new place very soon.
ELLIOT
(angry)
Uncle Ben, how did we get here?

19.
INT. CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT
Outside Ben and George’s apartment, the guests say their
goodbye’s to the hosts.
ELLIOT
I’m sorry if I was a bit rough,
Uncle. I’ve had a bad day.
KATE
Let’s go, Elliot.
TED
Think positive, Ben.
HONEY
I love you guys. I’ll call during
the week.
ROBERTO
Hey buddy, thanks for the beer.
MINDY
Good night, sweetheart.
BEN AND GEORGE (O.S.)
Good night. Good night.
The door shuts. The Guests walk down quietly towards the
elevator for a moment. Roberto and Ted stop in front of
another apartment, down the corridor.
We’re here.

ROBERTO

They start to say their good-byes, with hugs and kisses.
HONEY
I feel bad that I can’t help out,
but you guys have seen my
apartment.
MINDY
It’s okay. They can stay with me
for as long as it’s necessary.
HONEY
I just had this feeling that they
were hoping they’d stay with one
of us, here in the city. Didn’t
you guys see the look on their
faces?
Yes, they saw that look on their faces. All but Mindy.
(CONTINUED)

20.
CONTINUED:
MINDY
What are you talking about?
HONEY
I’m just saying... They don’t want
to go live Upstate. George and Ben
country boys, all of a sudden? I
can’t see that.
MINDY
It’s temporary!
ELLIOT
Honey is right. Maybe there’s
something else we can do.
MINDY
I thought we had it all figured
out already!
HONEY
Shhh, Mindy. Quiet.
MINDY
Why are we even having this
conversation? I’m the only one
with the extra bedroom.
ELLIOT
It’s not that, Mindy. It’s
Poughkeepsie.
MINDY
When was the last time you were
there?
ELLIOT
Doesn’t matter. George has his
private students here. Ben has his
galleries.
ROBERTO
And they’ll need to look for a new
apartment.
HONEY
It just doesn’t make sense that
they go live 2 1/2 hours away.
MINDY
It’s an hour and a half, actually.
TED
Not by bus, it’s not.
(CONTINUED)

21.
CONTINUED: (2)
By car.

MINDY

HONEY
They don’t drive!
MINDY
They can very well learn how to.
HONEY
Are you really serious, Mindy?!
MINDY
Shut the fuck up, Honey. You’re
not even family, so you don’t get
to decide anything!
They realize at this moment that they can’t let their
friends go live with crazy Mindy.
TED
Pshhh... Quiet. They’re right
there.
KATE
Elliot, let’s go. I still need to
do some work tonight.
ROBERTO
Since we’re all here, why don’t
you come inside for a minute?
Roberto puts his key on the door, opens it. Kate holds
Elliot’s hand, signaling that she wants to go.
KATE
(whispers)
It’s almost 10 o’clock.
ELLIOT
Honey, we need to figure this out.
ROBERTO
Come in, please.
Come in.

TED

Reluctantly, Kate follows her husband Elliot. They all go
inside.

22.
INT. BEN AND GEORGE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
In the kitchen, Ben is washing the drinking glasses used
by the guests. He washes thoroughly, slowly, taking this
moment alone maybe to reflect, almost meditative.
George comes in quietly carrying two plates. He leaves
the left over cheese on the counter and pours the left
over crackers in the trash. He gives Ben a kiss on his
cheek, then leaves.
After Ben finishes washing the last glass, he turns the
water faucet off and proceeds to wrap the leftover cheese
in plastic wrap, and then puts it inside a zip lock bag.
He turns the water on again, and washes this last item the plate that carried the cheese.
Ben turns the water off, finally, and looks around. All
is clean.
INT. CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT (CONT.)
George leaves the door to his apartment ajar and walks
down the corridor, carrying a full trash bag. As he
passes by Roberto’s apartment, he seems to hear voices
coming from inside. He continues down towards a door at
the end of the corridor. He opens it and throws the bag
down the chute. On his way back, he stops in front of
Roberto’s apartment for a moment. He can’t make out what
people are saying, but he can definitely hear voices: a
woman’s voice, and then a man’s voice - an argument
coming from inside the apartment. He knows it’s Kate,
Elliot, Roberto. He feels sad that it’s come to this.
George goes back inside his apartment, and shuts the door
behind him.
The empty, silent corridor with its cold light.
FADE OUT.
EXT. PARK SLOPE - DAY
A busy corner in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Old ethnic
restaurants share the street with hip cafés. Young
couples walk by with their kids, as an Older Indian
couple open the doors to their store.
On the street, a couple of teenagers on skateboards rush
by noisily, crossing the screen.

23.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
The spacious living room of this Park Slope apartment is
bright, with big windows that face a tree-lined street.
The apartment is just high enough so that the leaves of
the trees filter the sun, and cast shadows inside the
apartment in this early fall afternoon.
ELLIOT (O.S.)
We have the crew, plus 4 actors
and 25 extras, so you tell me how
or where we are going to
accommodate this crowd if we can’t
close the street at 7.
Elliot is on the phone, sitting at a desk by the window,
with papers scattered around: a budget sheet, a couple of
actors’ 8 x 10, Polaroids of locations, a shot list.
ELLIOT
(...) You told me we had the
permit already!
Joey shows up at the desk.
JOEY
Dad. Dad. Can I talk to you for a
second?
ELLIOT
James, hold on.
(to Joey)
What’s going on, Joey?
JOEY
That geography presentation I have
to do.
Which one?

ELLIOT

JOEY
The one on sustainable
development. I told you.
ELLIOT
Oh, that one. Yeah?
JOEY
Vlad and I are doing it together,
as a team. They’re painting his
house, so I told him to come here.

(CONTINUED)

24.
CONTINUED:
ELLIOT
(the phone calls his
attention)
No, no, no. It was from 7pm to
5am. That’s what I requested. Hold
on a second.
JOEY
Do you need the living room all
afternoon?
ELLIOT
Joey, I’m sorry but this is
urgent. Can you give me just a few
minutes? I’m sorry, Son.
(back on the phone)
You know as well as I do that two
hours will make all the
difference, because if we have to
wait till 9 to close the street...
Joey waits quietly for a moment next to his dad. But
soon, the BUZZER rings.
Joey opens the entrance door, and VLAD, his buddy, is
standing there. Vlad is 16, Russian, only one year older
than Joey, but more developed, bigger. Whereas Joey still
has boyish looks, Vlad already looks like the man he’ll
be one day. He comes in, carrying a backpack, and a
SKATEBOARD.
VLAD
I found the book on the Amazon
Rainforest. There’s some really
cool old pictures, with naked
natives and everything.
Nice.

JOEY

ELLIOT (O.S.)
...it means the crew won’t be
ready until 11, or 12, do you
understand? (...) No! That’s not a
possibility.
VLAD
Your dad is home.
They both look at Elliot sitting by the desk in the
living room, still busy on the phone.
I know.

JOEY

(CONTINUED)

25.
CONTINUED: (2)
VLAD
Let’s go to your room?
Not yet.

JOEY

VLAD
Okay. Can I get some water?
Yeah.

JOEY

INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Vlad enters, and sees Eugenia at the sink, doing dishes,
pretty as ever.
Hi there.

VLAD

EUGENIA
(Surprised)
Oh hello. I’m sorry. I didn’t see
you there.
I’m Vlad.

VLAD

EUGENIA
My name is Eugenia.
Vlad’s staring. He makes her a little uncomfortable.
EUGENIA (CONT’D)
I work for Mr. And Mrs. Hull.
VLAD
Are you Russian?
Yes.

EUGENIA

Vlad reaches his han19d out. Eugenia dries her hands on
the towel and they shake.
VLAD
(in Russian)
Very nice to meet you, Eugenia.
EUGENIA
(in Russian)
Nice to meet you too.

26.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - DAY
Kate is sitting on her bed, with her laptop on a pillow.
The door is ajar, and Joey enters.
Mom.
Yes?

JOEY
KATE

JOEY
Vlad is here. We have to do our
presentation on Sustainable
Development today.
KATE
Oh wow. I can’t wait to see it.
JOEY
I think we’re going to the
library.
KATE
But isn’t Vlad here?
JOEY
I told you, yes.
KATE
So why don’t you guys just stay
here?
INT. JOEY’S BEDROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Joey’s bedroom is small, with a bunk bed and a small desk
by the window with a computer. There’s a bookshelf full
of books, photos and some quirky objects. On the wall a
faux vintage poster of the Titanic (the boat, not the
movie).
And there, propped up on the lower of the beds, with an
open book lying on his chest, is Ben. He is shirtless,
and wearing only his boxer shorts underwear. His eyes are
closed, his head tilted to the side - he has fallen
asleep, his reading glasses dangling from his nose.
The door opens, and Joey comes in, followed by Kate. Both
take in the unexpected vision of the old man’s nearly
naked body.
KATE
(whispering)
Wake him gently.
(CONTINUED)

27.
CONTINUED:
You do it.

JOEY

KATE
(impatient)
Oh, c’mon, Joey...
She moves gently towards the bed and gives Ben a
tentative poke. He opens his heavy eye lids slowly.
KATE
Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben, hi. Sorry
to wake you. Joey wants to ask you
something.
JOEY

Mom!

Kate steps back and gently pushes Joey closer to Ben.
JOEY
Uncle Ben, my friend Vlad is here.
We need to do a presentation for
school, and there’s nowhere for us
to study.

Who?

(dazed)

BEN

Vlad steps in from behind Joey, curious to finally see
the old man in person.
BEN
Ah, Vlad, it’s so good to meet
you. I’ve heard a lot about you.
Hi.

VLAD

BEN
I’m sorry, I guess I’ve fallen
asleep.
He sits up, but still doesn’t move to get dressed.
BEN
What time is it?
2:05.

VLAD

BEN
So what is this presentation
about?
(CONTINUED)

28.
CONTINUED: (2)
Ben looks at Joey, who’s looking at his mother, who’s
looking at him. Nobody says anything.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
The desk in the living room now has been taken over by
Kate, and her computer. Elliot is nowhere in sight. Only
a few pages of notes neatly piled up next to the
computer, while Kate seems concentrated, writing away.
BEN (O.S.)
Did I tell you that my gallerist
friend is a big fan of yours?
It takes Kate a moment to register that someone is
talking to her.
On the other side of the room, Ben has created a makeshift studio, with an easel and a drawing pad. He has a
few photos tacked to the wall beside him, and a box of
charcoals that he is sketching with.
BEN (CONT’D)
Did I tell you?
A fan of mine?

KATE

BEN
She loves your book.
That’s nice.

KATE

Kate, after this brief exchange, is back to the computer,
trying to finish that one sentence interrupted a moment
ago.
Ben puts his charcoal back in its box.
BEN
I need some tea. Do you want some?
KATE
I’d love some, thanks.
Ben walks towards the kitchen.
BEN
You remember her, right?
Kate types the rest of the sentence before pausing again.

(CONTINUED)

29.
CONTINUED:
Who?

KATE

BEN
Ada. My gallerist friend.
Ben goes into the kitchen
KATE
When did I met her?
BEN (O.S.)
That group show I had? She’s the
owner of the gallery.
KATE
In the Lower East Side? Yes, I met
her, I think.
Tall blonde.
(pause)
Swedish.

BEN (O.S.)

KATE
Yes, I met her.
BEN (O.S.)
She’s very nice.
And pretty.

KATE

BEN (O.S.)
Gorgeous, that’s the one. Last
week I stopped by the gallery and
she was reading your book. I
screamed. I absolutely screamed.
Oh yeah?

KATE

INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - DAY
Ben washes a couple of dirty dishes. He cleans the
kitchen top with a paper towel. He opens the top cabinet,
and takes his time selecting two mugs amongst the large
selection.
BEN
She had no idea you were my niece.
That’s funny.

KATE (O.S.)
(CONTINUED)

30.
CONTINUED:
The kettle on the gas burner starts to steam. As the
speed of the releasing steam increases, the vibrations
become louder, whistle, and Ben turns the oven off.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
Kate is concentrated on her writing, typing and drinking
tea.
Ben is now sitting on the couch, blowing invisible steam
from his cup, carefully taking tiny sips of tea, pensive.
BEN
You know my favorite story of
yours? The one about the old high
school friend who shows up at the
diner.
Kate keeps on typing, trying to avoid another long
interruption.
BEN
She sees him, but I don’t remember
why she can’t be sure it’s her
friend.
Kate doesn’t take the bait. She’s still typing.
BEN
The worst thing about getting old
is the memory.
(pause)
It only gets worse with time, let
me tell you.
Kate can’t let this go on much longer. She stops typing
once again.
KATE
She can’t see him because he’s
outside and it’s snowing.
BEN
Of course! He’s in the car, right?
KATE
She’s not really sure if it’s him.
BEN
Because of the blizzard.
(pause)
And then there’s that awful hit
and run at the end.
(CONTINUED)

31.
CONTINUED:
Right.

KATE

BEN
That was shocking. I really lost
my breath at that part. How she
knows it’s him, her old friend,
even though she never really saw
him. So beautiful, Kate, really.
It’s such good writing.
Ben drinks some tea and it burns his tongue.
BEN
Ouch. It’s hot.
Kate downs her tea. She glances at the computer screen,
unable to actually write anything.
BEN
Which is your favorite?
KATE
I don’t have a favorite.
BEN
That’s just like me with my
paintings. I don’t have a favorite
either. George does. He loves that
one that hangs in our bedroom. Or
used to hang in our bedroom. I
gave that to him-KATE
--on his 40th birthday, I know. I
love that one too...Maybe you can
start a new painting soon.
BEN
That’s the hardest thing, to be
honest with you, Kate. I brought
all my stuff, but...
What?

KATE

BEN
Well... It’s just that... I can’t
really work if there’s someone
else around. I can’t concentrate.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
The door opens, and Elliot comes in.
(CONTINUED)

32.
CONTINUED:
He is coming from work, with a messenger bag and some
envelopes in hand. He sees Kate in bed, asleep in an
awkward position with a book on top of the covers and the
reading light on. He comes to pick up the book, places it
on the bedside table and turns the light off.
Kate opens her eyes, awake, and sees Elliot going into
the bathroom.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Elliot is washing his hands in the bathroom sink. He
looks at himself in the mirror for just a brief moment,
and seems disappointed at his own image. He looks down at
his hands again, and washes them thoroughly, letting
water run through them.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Elliot comes from the bathroom wearing boxer shorts and
an old T-shirt. He finds Kate reading the book in bed,
pencil in hand.
How was it?
Good.
And Jeremy?

KATE
ELLIOT
KATE

He gets into bed, gives his wife a kiss on her cheek and
turns the other way to lie down under the covers.
ELLIOT
Better than we could’ve ever
expected.
KATE
See, I told you.
I know.

ELLIOT

KATE
I called to see if you were coming
to dinner.
You did?

ELLIOT

(CONTINUED)

33.
CONTINUED:
KATE
Left a message.
ELLIOT
I didn’t even have a moment to
check my messages.
That busy?

KATE

ELLIOT
Yeah, but we got it all in the
can.
That’s great.
I’m exhausted.

KATE
ELLIOT

Elliot is trying to fall asleep, while Kate keeps reading
next to him. He turns around, ends up facing her but
talks with his eyes closed, afraid the light would
disturb his sleepiness.
Sleep baby.

ELLIOT

Kate doesn’t respond.
Sleep.

ELLIOT (CONT’D)

Kate underlines a passage on the book. Elliot finally
opens his eyes, looks at her.
ELLIOT (CONT’D)
What’s going on, Kate?
KATE
Unlike you, I didn’t have a very
productive day.
Is it Joey?

ELLIOT

KATE
Joey? Joey hardly said a word to
me today, but if you were around
more, you’d see that that’s the
norm.
ELLIOT
What is it, Kate? The neighbor
again?
(CONTINUED)

34.
CONTINUED: (2)
KATE
No, Elliot. It’s your uncle. When
it’s loud music, it’s easy to tell
them to turn it down. But if it’s
Uncle Ben chatting away, it’s a
lot harder to tell him to shut up.
INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY
A tiny hole-in-the-wall law office. A LAWYER is sitting
at his desk, typing on his computer.
LAWYER
Your mortgage was for $480,000, on
a 30 year fixed rate.
George is sitting on the chair in front of him. He is
holding a manila file folder with a bunch of loose papers
in it.
GEORGE
Yes, but we bought it for
$600,000.
LAWYER
In 2007, is that correct?
GEORGE
Yes, when it went co-op.
LAWYER
And we’re getting $750,000 now.
That’s robust.
I thought so.

GEORGE

LAWYER
You’re lucky things have gone up
since ‘08. Many people who bought
when you did have lost money
selling.
GEORGE
But that’s why I’m trying to
understand why we are only
seeing....
He opens his folder and looks through a few pages,
searching for the number.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Why we are only seeing $17,535 in
profit?
(CONTINUED)

35.
CONTINUED:
LAWYER
Well to start with you have to
take into account the closing
costs, which I told you about
previously.
GEORGE
Can you just remind me.
LAWYER
There’s the 1% New York City
transfer tax, the .04% New York
State tax, plus the 6% to me,
that’s $60,000 right there.
GEORGE
I understand all that. But from my
calculations...
He looks down at his paperwork.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
....that should still leave...
LAWYER
Don’t forget your co-op, also, has
a flip tax of 25% on whatever
profit you make, if you sell
before 5 years, so that’s
another...
GEORGE
But this is 5 years!
George bangs his fist on his lap.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
It’s been five years. We bought in
2007 and it’s 2013 now.
LAWYER
But Mr. Garea, you didn’t actually
close until January, if you
remember, so that was 2008, and
they go by the calendar year, so
you would actually have to sell in
2014 to avoid the flip tax.
GEORGE
This is really like Kafka.

(CONTINUED)

36.
CONTINUED: (2)
LAWYER
If you had been able to pay a
little more of your principle,
either as a down payment, or with
your mortgage. As of the sale..
The broker looks at his computer screen.
LAWYER
...$12,996 is what you had paid
off of your principal, Mr. Garea
GEORGE
After we paid $1,900 dollars every
month to the bank?
LAWYER
That’s because of the amortization
schedule. Your payments in the
beginning are largely going
towards the interest, and only a
smaller part towards the
principal. I hope someone
explained that to you previously.
GEORGE
It just never sounds very fair to
me.
LAWYER
Look at it this way: you’ve lived
in a nice apartment for 20 years,
five of that...
(he catches himself,
laughing awkwardly)
...or nearly five, as an owner,
and now you sold it at a profit.
You’re getting...
(looking at his
screen)
$17,535 dollars, which is all
yours.
George looks completely at a loss, like a bag of heavy
stones.
LAWYER
Listen, I won’t charge you for
today, if that is any help. We’ll
call it a courtesy.

37.
ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
The family is sitting at the dinner table, finishing
their dinner. Elliot, Kate and Joey have their plates
empty, while Ben still works on his meat, very, very
slowly.
JOEY
Ours was about “mixed farming”
which is when farmers manage a mix
of different crops and animals.
ELLIOT
And why is that eco-friendly?
JOEY
Nobody says eco-friendly anymore,
dad.
KATE
It’s eco-efficient now.
JOEY
No, we say “sustainable”.
Sustainable agriculture.
I see.

ELLIOT

Kate looks at Ben, still cutting his meat. Elliot looks
at Kate, looking at Ben, then at his own empty plate.
Joey also looks at Ben’s plate, then up to the ceiling,
impatience starting to boil in him.
ELLIOT
So why is mixed farming
sustainable?
JOEY
Cause that’s when crop residues
are used to feed the animals and
the... the excrements from animals
are used as nutrients for the
crop.
KATE
Eewwww. Your uncle is still
eating, Joey.
I’m sorry.
What?

JOEY
BEN

(CONTINUED)

38.
CONTINUED:
Ben wasn’t paying attention to the conversation, lost in
his thoughts while cutting the fat off his meat with an
obsessive focus.
JOEY
Can I be excused? I still need to
study tonight.
KATE
You don’t want dessert?
ELLIOT
What do we have?
KATE
Strawberries and frozen yogurt.
No thanks.

JOEY

Joey gets up, takes his plate to the kitchen sink and
leaves.
Ben takes a bite. Elliot looks at Kate, looking at Ben,
chewing slowly...
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Roberto and Ted’s apartment is the same size as their exneighbors, but a very different decor. Where Ben and
George’s was thoughtfully put together, with style and
art, this one is simply functional. Where in the other
one the piano commanded the space in the living room, in
this one it’s the giant flat screen TV.
The TV is on, and Ted has a small control in his hand
which commands the screen. He’s setting up his new Apple
TV, going step by step. George is sitting next to him,
eating a bowl of ice cream. Ted has a bottle of beer in
front of him.
TED
It’s all through the wi-fi. This
little box over there connects
directly with our Netflix account,
iTunes and with YouTube. Here let
me show you.
Ted sips his beer, then manipulates the controls while
the screen changes with different images.
TED
Have you seen this?
(CONTINUED)

39.
CONTINUED:
A huge dragon, a slave in a leather harness, a sexy
princess - a Game of Thrones style show on TV.
GEORGE
No, what is this?
TED
You’ve never seen this? Game of
Thrones! It’s my favorite. Look,
that’s King Baratheon and Queen
Cersei. She hates him. Look, and
that’s Ser Jaime, with whom she
has an affair.
He’s sexy.

GEORGE

TED
He’s her twin brother and they’re
lovers but it’s okay because it’s
like medieval times in the future.
I’m so glad you haven’t seen this,
because you and I are going to
watch it together.
Oh, are we?

GEORGE

TED
I have the whole first two seasons
on my computer.
GEORGE
So your computer has to be on.
TED
No, not at all. It’s all sync’d
through the Cloud.
GEORGE
What’s the Cloud?
TED
The Cloud is like an imaginary
hard disk. It has all your info so
all your different gadgets can be
synch’ed through the wi-fi.
George is not listening. He’s tired. He stares at his
empty bowl.
GEORGE
Is there any more ice cream, Ted?

(CONTINUED)

40.
CONTINUED: (2)
TED
Yes, I think so.
The door opens, and in comes Roberto in his police
outfit, with his police woman buddy, DOREEN, both coming
from work. He carries a bag of groceries and a six pack
of beer.
I’m hungry!

ROBERTO

TED
Look, baby. I got it hooked up.
Hey guys!

DOREEN

Without ever letting go of the mini control, Ted stands
up and high fives Doreen - she’s clearly one of the guys.
Doreen!

TED

ROBERTO
Hey George, you’ve met my friend
Doreen, right?
George stands up to shake her hand, as she drowns herself
on the couch.
Hi George.

DOREEN

ROBERTO
Babe, come help me in the kitchen?
TED
In two minutes.
Roberto disappears into the kitchen. Ted keeps playing
with the remote.
George sits again, and Doreen taps him on his thigh,
friendly.
DOREEN
So how are your two new daddies
treating you?
GEORGE
Oh I can’t complain.
DOREEN
I’ve always liked this couch. I’ve
taken good naps here.
(CONTINUED)

41.
CONTINUED: (3)
GEORGE
It’s a good bed too.
DOREEN
If I drink too much... Maybe I’ll
sleep with you here tonight.
ROBERTO (O.S.)
Adams or Corona?
DOREEN
(screams)
Whichever is colder!
(to Ted and George)
You guys?
TED
I think I’ll have wine.
GEORGE
(to Ted)
What happened to my ice cream?
TED
Did you mean to ask me if I would
get you some ice cream, George?
GEORGE
Yes. I think because you’re from
Manhasset, you don’t understand
the subtlety.
TED
No, I understood perfectly well. I
just prefer when people are
direct.
A beat of silence. Doreen takes the remote control from
Ted’s hands.
DOREEN
Go help Roberto. I’ll finish this
for you.
TED
Do you even know how to?
DOREEN
Show me some respect, soldier.
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT
Ted takes out the groceries from the bag, while Roberto
gets a heavy tupperware out of the refrigerator.
(CONTINUED)

42.
CONTINUED:
He opens it, sniffs it out and shows it to Ted.
TED
That’s not enough. Who else is
coming?
Just Linda.

ROBERTO

TED
Should I invite Marco?
ROBERTO
Sure. I’ll add some chicken to the
curry, and what else?
They’re briefly interrupted by Doreen’s voice coming from
the living room.
DOREEN (O.S.)
(...) your iPhoto as screen saver?

Sure!

TED
(screams to the other
room)

(back to ROBERTO)
I can make the basmati with
broccoli, and a big salad.
Perfect.

ROBERTO

INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sitting alone at the dinner table, away from everybody
else for privacy, George talks on the phone. He looks on
as Doreen takes her boots off and drinks beer, making
herself comfortably at home.
GEORGE
(on the phone)
...it seems like they’re just
starting dinner now. (...) No,
tomorrow I have a student in the
morning....
George keeps talking on the phone, and he sees Doreen
going to open the door. From afar, he now sees Doreen
hugging and kissing a newcomer: her partner LINDA, who
arrives with a BABY.

(CONTINUED)

43.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Me? I’ve eaten already. (...) I
stopped at the diner and had some
matzo ball soup. (...) No, no
grilled cheese, I swear.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Ben is alone by the large window in the dark living room
of his nephew’s apartment. All around is quiet, the whole
apartment seems to be asleep - only the light from the
street outside, and a quiet conversation that Ben is
having over the phone.
BEN
(on the phone)
I made beef stew tonight. (...) I
think they did. They ate the whole
thing, but they didn’t say
anything.(...) No, they’re very
nice, but sometimes when you live
with people, you know them better
than you care to - that’s all.
(...)
The large, empty and dark living room. Silence. Ben stays
by the window, his profile catching the outside light.
EXT. ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG - DAY
Ben is behind his standing easel on this Park Slope
outdoor rooftop. Around him, there are only tree tops and
neighboring rooftops, the sun and a nice breeze. Ben,
wearing his dirty painters’s apron, is sketching away
with a thin paintbrush on a new canvas.
He looks up and back down to the canvas.
And in front of him, standing proud as a statue, is Vlad
wearing a tank top and holding HIS SKATEBOARD, the model
of Ben’s new painting.
Ben uses his fingers to blur and fix a couple of lines,
redrawing details on the canvas.
The noisy metal door to the rooftop opens with a CLANK.
Ben raises his eyes above the canvas, to see that an out
of breath and very surprised Joey is standing between him
and his subject Vlad.
JOEY
What the fuck, Vlad!
(CONTINUED)

44.
CONTINUED:
VLAD
I’m posing for your uncle’s new
masterpiece.
JOEY
(to Vlad)
That is so gay!
An awkward silence, as Ben continues to paint.
BEN
People have been modeling for
painters for centuries now. All
kinds of people.
Joey looks at Vlad one more time, to see that his friend
continues to “pose”, enjoying his 15 minutes of fame.
VLAD
He doesn’t mean homosexual, Ben.
He just means stupid.
BEN
Don’t worry Vlad. Joey and I
understand each other.
Joey walks behind Ben and looks over his shoulder at the
painting.
JOEY
You’re not a good artist anyway.
BEN
I know you don’t mean that, Joey.
JOEY
But I do. If you were, you
wouldn’t have to crash on a bunk
bed in your nephew’s house!
Joey walks away. A door in the distance CLANKS shut.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
(CONTINUOUS)
Kate is writing at the desk in the living room. Joey
comes in.
KATE
Did you find him?
JOEY
He’s on the fucking rooftop with
Uncle Ben.
(CONTINUED)

45.
CONTINUED:
KATE
Hey! Watch your language.
Joey goes into his bedroom.
Kate takes a deep breath, a sip from her tea and tries to
go back to her writing. But soon Joey storms out of his
room.
I’m going out.
And Vlad?

JOEY
KATE

JOEY
Uncle Ben is making him pose for a
painting.
He’s what??
You heard me.

KATE
JOEY

KATE
Joey, wait a minute. I suggested
to your Uncle Ben that he take his
painting to the roof. It was my
idea. Don’t you see? I need to
work here.
I need to go.

JOEY

And he leaves.
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
In the dark stairwell of the building, Ben is carrying
his painting box and canvas, while Vlad comes from
outside helping him with all the rest: easel, skateboard
and the box of paintings. Suddenly, he stops.
BEN
You okay there?
The bottom of the easel got stuck on the door. Vlad gives
it a little kick, and the door closes with a CLANK.
We’re good.

VLAD

(CONTINUED)

46.
CONTINUED:
Ben tries a switch on the wall, but the main light
doesn’t go on.
Oh well.

BEN

It’s dark, and Ben is careful step by step.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
Kate is concentrating on work, typing away on her
computer, when Vlad comes in loaded with Ben’s easel,
painting materials and his skateboard.
Kate stops writing and goes to Vlad.
KATE
Vlad, what were you doing up
there?
VLAD
I was helping Ben with his
painting.
KATE
Weren’t you supposed to be
studying biology?
VLAD
It’s going to be all about this
book on seasons and migrations,
and I know the book pretty well.
KATE
But if you flunk the test
tomorrow, what am I going to tell
your mother when she calls and
asks if you and Joey were really
studying or just playing here?
I don’t flunk.

VLAD

Ben arrives, in his paint splashed apron, carrying the
canvas with him.
VLAD
Ben, where should I leave this?
BEN
Just leave it there. I’ll take
care of it.

(CONTINUED)

47.
CONTINUED:
KATE
Listen, Vlad, when you’re here,
you’re my responsibility.
Kate makes sure Ben is listening to this as he picks up
his easel on the floor.
KATE (CONT’D)
So if you have a biology test
tomorrow, you should be studying
with Joey, instead of taking art
lessons on the roof.
Where is Joey?

VLAD

KATE
He went to the library.
VLAD
I guess I’ll go meet him there.
KATE
I think that’s a good idea.
Vlad gets his skateboard and backpack, and heads to the
door.
KATE
Do you want to take some food,
some water or anything?
VLAD
I’m okay. Thank you, Mrs. Hull.
Bye, Ben. I’ll see you soon.
Bye Vlad.
Okay, Bye.

BEN
KATE

Vlad leaves. Kate goes back to her desk, while Ben takes
the rest of his stuff into the bedroom.
Kate is quietly typing away.
BEN (O.S.)
I didn’t know they were supposed
to be studying.
Kate turns and sees, to her surprise, Ben on the couch
with a book. She keeps on typing, trying to write.

(CONTINUED)

48.
CONTINUED: (2)
BEN
Joey got very upset. He called
Vlad “gay” in quite an offensive
fashion.
KATE
Kids have broadened the meaning of
the word “gay” far beyond sexual
orientation, so don’t get
offended.
BEN
I didn’t, really. I guess it just
means ‘stupid’ now.
KATE
I think you’re right.
BEN
I don’t know if Joey felt left
out, or what in the world was
going through his mind.
Kate stops typing, and closes her laptop and stands up,
gathering all of her things, impatient.
KATE
They’re teenagers. And is it
really appropriate to be using
Joey’s friend as a model?
She walks towards her bedroom, carrying her laptop,
notebooks and pen.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
A very steamy bathroom, one can hardly see anything
inside. Someone is quietly taking a very hot shower. The
water gets shut off, but the person still stays inside
the box for a moment, as if enjoying the last drops from
the shower - a quiet meditative moment.
Finally, the box opens, and Ben grabs a towel. He starts
to dry himself off.
INT. MINDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
A small house with bland worn out furniture, and dog toys
scattered around the place. It’s quite dark inside, and
there are three DOGS of different breeds, each lying
lazily in his/her own cushion. They pretty much own the
place.
(CONTINUED)

49.
CONTINUED:
The phone rings. Mindy enters. She has a slight dazed
look on her face, maybe from a nap - or a couple of
martinis. She has to get around one of the dogs to get to
the phone, and knocks her foot onto the table.
MINDY
Ouch! Son of bitch. Ouch, oh!
(on the phone)
Hello? (...) Oh hi, Kate! How are
you? (...)
As she listens, she sits on the couch and grabs a
cigarette from a pack on the coffee table.
MINDY (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Oh, I’m good. Everything is great amazing, actually. Yes, I went to
see this chromotherapist up in
Kingston.
She lights the cigarette.
MINDY (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Chromotherapy! (...) The guy talks
to you for 15 minutes, then he
floats his hand all over your body
and he feels whatever type of
energy you’re lacking - physical,
emotional, spiritual. It’s hard to
explain. But he feels the energy
levels and then prescribes colored
lights to restore your balance. I
was just taking a nap under a
greenish light he gave me. You
wouldn’t believe it, but I feel
like I’m a different person. I
have much more energy, and (...)
Hun-hun, I know. And how’s Uncle
Ben? (...) Uh-hun, I know. It must
be hard for him. (...) I know, I
see.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT - NIGHT
Ben, in a bath robe, his hair still wet, is standing
outside the closed door to Kate’s bedroom. For a moment
he hears her voice, then knocks on the door.
Come in!

KATE (O.S.)

(CONTINUED)

50.
CONTINUED:
BEN
Sorry, I didn’t want to interrupt.
Yes, Ben?

KATE

BEN
I wanted to talk about earlier.
KATE
Oh no, it’s fine.
Are you sure?

BEN

KATE
Yes, I’m talking to Mindy.
(a voice on the
phone)
She wants to know when you’re
going to visit her in
Poughkeepsie.
BEN
Ah, send her my love. We can talk
tomorrow.
Okay.

KATE

Ben shuts the door. He stands still for a moment, taking
in what he’s just heard, and then walks away.
INT. WAITING ROOM / AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CITY HALL - DAY
Ben and George sit in a typically bureaucratic waiting
room amongst other NEW YORKERS in search of a solution to
their housing problems. The light is dim, and the mood is
downcast.
Ben watches an old-fashioned TV set that hangs from the
corner of the ceiling, showing a day time soap opera.
George is searching through the files he has in a satchel
on his lap.
A door opens and a SOCIAL WORKER, a woman in her 50s,
enters.
SOCIAL WORKER (O.S.)
(to both men)
Mr. Garea?

(CONTINUED)

51.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
That’s me. This is Mr. Hull. I’d
like him to come with me.
SOCIAL WORKER
(cool, efficient)
Right this way.
She motions them both to follow her.
INT. OFFICE / AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CITY HALL - DAY
The Social Worker searches for and separates brochures,
applications and other paperwork from piles on her messy
desk.
SOCIAL WORKER
These apartments are city
sponsored and are currently
accepting applications. Tenants
are selected by a lottery, but
first you need to meet the
criteria for the specific
development. Each one has its own.
She hands some paperwork in their general direction.
SOCIAL WORKER
I only have one, I’m sorry.
We can share.

BEN

SOCIAL WORKER
The city itself does not rent the
apartments. If you get selected,
this will be a private real estate
transaction between you and the
real estate developer, understand?
George is trying to. Ben less so.
SOCIAL WORKER
You need to contact the developer
or the marketing agent directly you’ll see the phone numbers and
other info on the list I just gave
you.
GEORGE
I have a question.
George pauses, quite suddenly. The Social Worker looks up
from her paper work, expectantly.
(CONTINUED)

52.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
We’re married. We would be
applying together.
First time he says “married”. It feels funny to say that.
George and Ben both look at the Social Worker searching
for a reaction, and see no reaction at all: she’s a NYC
Social Worker after all.
Okay.

SOCIAL WORKER

GEORGE (CONT’D)
So, for example:
(reads from the list)
One bedroom in Ft.
Greene/Wallabout. Rent $511.00.
Minimum income $19,509, maximum
income $23,240. Would that be for
both tenants?
SOCIAL WORKER
Yes. Both, together. Anything you
find interesting there, check to
see if you meet the criteria, and
if you do, you’ll need to ask for
an application directly from them.
Remember to include a self
addressed envelope with your
request.
Okay.

GEORGE

George takes a look at some of the lists she gave him. A
moment of silence between them.
SOCIAL WORKER
That’s all I have for now.
BEN
Sounds like a good start.
SOCIAL WORKER
Typically demand exceeds supply
for those apartments, so we
suggest that you enter multiple
lotteries, and use other means for
pursuing housing such as
classified ads, online listings,
brokers, and word-of-mouth.
GEORGE
Thank you very much.
(CONTINUED)

53.
CONTINUED: (2)
SOCIAL WORKER
Use common sense and beware of
deals that sound too good to be
true.
Thanks.

GEORGE

The Social Worker observes Ben getting up from his chair.
SOCIAL WORKER
Sir. Can I ask a question?
Yes?

BEN

SOCIAL WORKER
How old are you?
I’m 71.

BEN

SOCIAL WORKER
Because you might want to try the
DFTA also?
DFTA?

GEORGE

She hands him yet another piece of paper.
SOCIAL WORKER
Department for the Aging.
BEN
They have a whole department just
for us? Isn’t that encouraging...
George doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry.
SOCIAL WORKER
They have a list of affordable
senior housing. It usually has a
waiting list, but it’s worth a
try.
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
George comes into an almost surreal scene in front of
him:

(CONTINUED)

54.
CONTINUED:
Ted, wearing a medieval warrior hat, Roberto, Doreen, and
Marco’s boyfriend, VINNIE, heavy set, with a beard,
wearing a heavy metal band T-shirt, are sitting around
the dinner table, which is covered with Dungeon & Dragons
paraphernalia: the game’s navigation maze, miniature
snakes, monsters, vampires and medieval warriors;
polyhedral multicolored dices, different manuals and, of
course, lots of beer, popcorn and bags of Doritos.
There’s also a bottle of Tequila.
TED
Hey George, do you want some beer?
Tequila?

ROBERTO

GEORGE
I’m kind of hungry, actually.
ROBERTO
We’re still waiting for Marco.
DOREEN
Don’t you guys think George would
be a great Lycanthrope?
A Cockatrice.

VINNIE

DOREEN
He’d be a perfect Lamia.
George strikes a pose as what/who he thinks Lamia is.
(sexy)
Lamia!

GEORGE

They laugh. Roberto laughs a little too much, his face
flushed from the alcohol.
GEORGE
You guys seem to be having fun.
TED
Come play with us, you’ll love it.
GEORGE
It looks very complicated.
DOREEN
Have a beer and just watch - best
way to learn this game.

GEORGE
I will, but I think I’ll eat a
little something first.
ROBERTO
There’s curry in the fridge.
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT
(CONT.)
George puts a plate in the microwave, and enters two
minutes on the timer.
He picks up a paper towel and cleans the counter, waiting
for his food, as he listens to chatter coming from the
living room.
DOREEN (O.S.)
I’m going to roll a perception
check.
(dice rolling)
31.
TED (O.S.)
You see a door.
DOREEN (O.S.)
I got a 31! All I see is a door?
TED (O.S.)
It’s a spooky door.
ROBERTO (O.S.)
That’s fucked up.
DOREEN (O.S.)
I open the door.
TED (O.S.)
Wait! Strength check.
On a door?

DOREEN (O.S.)

It’s a heavy door.
Is it locked?
Yes.

The microwave beeps next to George. He picks up a hot
plate of curry.
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guys continue to play the game in full force. Vinnie
jumps from his chair.
ROBERTO
I have dark vision. Can I see
what’s at the end of the hallway?
DOREEN
You cannot, because...
(with excitement)
It’s a Vampire Queen.
ROBERTO
(pretends a fright)
Uh! What’s her challenge rating?
DOREEN
Her challenge rating is 18.
ROBERTO
18? That’s kind of high for a
Vampire Queen, don’t you think?
I said 18!

DOREEN

ROBERTO
C’mon! Okay, you’re the DM but you
can’t do that.
DOREEN
Yes I can. I’m the DM; I can do
whatever I want.
Bitch.

ROBERTO

Roberto picks up a baton from the table.
ROBERTO
I’m going to use the wand of
wounding.

CONTINUED:
No way!

DOREEN

Doreen is fast and takes the baton from Roberto’s hand.
Give me that!

ROBERTO

Roberto grabs Doreen, who hugs the baton tight, so
Roberto can’t take it away from her. She’s laughing, but
Roberto is seriously upset.
Stop!

TED

Frustrated, and drunk, Roberto ends up pushing Doreen,
and grabbing the baton and cleaning out the table,
effectively messing up the whole game.
Oh c’mon baby!

TED

There are boos and protests from Doreen and Vinnie.
They don’t even notice as, in the background, George
crosses the room towards the door.
He opens the door and Marco is there in a camouflage
raincoat. He is closing an umbrella, dripping wet.
MARCO
George! You don’t want to go out
there, my friend. It’s really
coming down.
George passes by him.
GEORGE
Thank you. I’ll be fine.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kate and Elliot are washing dishes, while Ben is still at
the table, slowly eating his dinner.
We can hear the rain falling heavily outside.
ELLIOT

enjoy the Louvre?
KATE
He’s obsessed with the French
Revolution.

intrusion.
ELLIOT
Speak of the devil.
Who?

KATE

ELLIOT

watch)
10PM. That would be Vlad.
The buzzer rings again, as Kate reaches for the intercom.
Who is it?

KATE

GEORGE (O.S.)

intercom)
It’s George.

INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Ben opens the door, and George comes in, all wet from the
rain outside.
BEN
What happened??
George gives him a hug, a very tight hug, and starts to
cry.
GEORGE
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
BEN
Stop it. Don’t be silly.
They hug each other tightly, George now crying like a
baby.
Elliot observes the scene from a distance. Kate wants to
step forward to help out, but Elliot stops her from
moving.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, JOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Joey is at his desk in front of the computer. Elliot

ELLIOT
Son, I need to ask you a favor.
What is it?

JOEY

ELLIOT
Do you mind sleeping on the couch

C’mon, Dad.

JOEY

smart. He really wants to bring
back a music program.
BEN
Do they have the budget for it?
GEORGE
Not right now, but he seems like
he might be very good at raising
money. He has a very attractive
personality.
BEN
That doesn’t really help us much
right now, does it?
GEORGE
I haven’t finished my story. Can I
finish it?
BEN
They don’t have a job for you,

No, it’s not. You’re such a
pessimist.
BEN
I’m being realistic.
Let me finish!

BEN
Okay. Go ahead.
GEORGE
Thank you. They have all kinds of
kids there: lots of black and
latin, but also white, a few
Asians. This really cute girl,
Filipino, I think she was. She
played Frere Jacques for me on her
flute.
BEN
George, why don’t you come down
here so I can hear you better.
GEORGE
It’s a bunk bed.
So?

BEN

GEORGE
You told me Joey was already
losing his patience with you. Can
you imagine if you broke his bed
trying to shag your husband.
BEN
I have missed having your body
next to mine too much to have it
denied to me for reasons of bad
engineering.
George sits up, and moves to the edge of the bed. He
awkwardly maneuvers himself on to the ladder and down the
side.
Ben is squished as far as he can be to the wall, waiting
for George with the sheets pulled back.
George gets into the bed with him.
They take each other in for a long moment.
GEORGE
Do you ever blame me for all of
this?
BEN
Why would I blame you? We did it
together.

But I knew what might happen. I
knew more than you what we were
risking.

you. This situation we’ve gotten
ourselves in is really fucking
with my sleeping patterns.
INT. PIANO STUDENT’S HOME - DAY
A YOUNG GIRL plays at the grand Steinway piano, in this
upper middle class apartment. Even though the metronome
on top of the piano is giving a certain rhythm, the Girl
seems to be following no one in her interpretation of
this Prelude by Chopin.
George walks around the Girl, and the piano, listening
carefully. And as soon as the Girl finishes...
What happened?

GEORGE

The Girl looks at him somehow surprised at his reaction
GEORGE
What was that?! That wasn’t what
we talked about last week.
GIRL
Interpretation.
GEORGE
Yes, and I insist that it is
crucial to let the music take you
someplace, to be surprised by it,
even to allow yourself to be
overwhelmed sometimes. That is as
important as knowing the
difference between a semitone and
a half-step. But at the same time,
you have to stay focused on the
instrument you’re playing, and
listen. Always - listen! What is
the metronome telling you...
(clap his hands)
...tik - tok - tik!! You-ha-ve-to-fol-low! You can’t just create
your own rhythm to Chopin. Let’s
do it again.

63.
CONTINUED:

The Girl is back at the Prelude. George paces back and
forth for a moment, listening, then sits on a bench
behind her. He sees when the Girl’s MOTHER shows up
quietly, discreetly, peeking from the corridor, smiling
at George and listening.
The Chopin Prelude soars. The girl plays it well. George
listens with attention to the music, and seems moved by
it.
GEORGE (V.O.)
Dear parents,
By now you have all heard of my
joyful news, and of my sad news.
To be able to finally marry my
partner of almost 40 years,
Benjamin Hull, in a small ceremony
here at the New York City Hall was
one of the happiest moments of my
life. Unfortunately, later I found
out that I could no longer
continue to teach music at St.
Grace’s.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/CLASSROOM (DOCUMENTARY STYLE) DAY
A PRIEST drawing numbers of an equation on the
blackboard, teaching math to a class.
At their desks, the UNIFORMED STUDENTS, some paying
attention, some absent-mindedly looking out the window,
others making notes.
The Chopin Prelude continues to play over these scenes.
GEORGE (V.O., CONT.)
Most of you, and everyone at the
school, knew that I was gay and
that Ben was my life-long partner.
I have always had nothing but
support from all of you, so I
would like to thank you, and also
to emphasize that I understand
that what happened is not the
fault of St. Grace’s and its
leadership.

64.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY
Students in the hallways, at their lockers, some running,
while others confering with a teacher, and with each
other.
GEORGE (V.O., CONT.)
Above all, I urge you to take this
opportunity to have a conversation
with your children about whether
or not justice was served here.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/GYMNASIUM - DAY
A basketball court; the boys sweating, playing,
competitive.
INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY
Students get ready for a dress rehearsal. They put on
their gowns, and walk up the steps of the chorus.
GEORGE (V.O., CONT)
The last thing I want them to take
from this is that they should hide
who they are, or what they think,
if they believe it will get them
into trouble. Life has its
obstacles, but I’ve learned early
on that they will always be
lessened if faced with honesty.
The students arrange themselves on the steps, playfully
at first, but gradually become solemn and organized, as
the new CONDUCTOR seems ready to start the music.
INT. CORRIDOR OF BEN AND GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT
George walks the same corridor of his old apartment,
towards Roberto’s door.
GEORGE (V.O., CONT’D)
I believe the world is a better
place if people aren't lying.
In the words of the apostle Paul
to the Corinthians: “Love does not
delight in injustice, but rejoices
with the truth.” Yours sincerely,
George Garea.

sitting next to each other on his bed, with some books on
their laps, which they quickly hide however they can.

dot polka.
They laugh. It helps clear the air.
What is that?

KATE

BEN
A Busby Berkeley musical.
ELLIOT
It’s like an acid trip with Alice
Faye and Carmen Miranda. The
dancers hold these huge bananas...

they have huge penises.
BEN
Oh, not really. It’s not like
that.
ELLIOT
Yes it is. It’s totally phallic.
KATE
I know that scene!
BEN
They have a wonderful new print.
And I have to say Elliot, I was so
happy when they came out with VHS,
we could watch all those old
movies again, and I’m glad I
showed them to you. But watching
this in the big screen, it’s
something else. It’s not even the
same movie.

Have you ever been in love?
I’m not gay!

JOEY

I didn’t mean to imply that, Joey.
JOEY
So what do you mean?
BEN
Love. You know what love is.
Silence.

I was 14. We were on vacation in
Saint Croix. That’s in the Virgin

There was another family renting a
house on the same beach as ours.
They had a daughter, she was 16

BEN
And if you do, would you say hello
to her this time?
I don’t know.

JOEY

BEN
I think you should.
Ben turns his reading light off. All is quiet, the room
is dark.
EXT. ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG - DAY
On a used palette, full of different colored spots, some
green paint is mixed with a little brown. The result is a
dark green, so the brush adds a little cream, and the mix
become the perfect color for the Park Slope outdoors.
Ben sits on his portable stool, painting the canvas on
his easel.
The painter starts to fill up the contours of his picture
with green and blue.
It is a breezy, quiet afternoon.
The Skateboarder at the center of the painting seems to
be done, and the trees, rooftops and sky around him start
to gain life with brush strokes of color.

71.
EXT. ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG -- END OF DAY
The light has changed, it’s later in the day now. Ben
applies subtle brush strokes to the canvas in front of
him. With his finger, he rubs the fresh mix of green and
brown on the painting, for effect. He takes a step back
to look.
Ben looks at the sky. A wind blows, sending dead tree
leaves flying through the air.
INT. STAIRWELL - END OF THE DAY
Ben opens the door from the roof to the stairwell loaded
with his painting materials, carrying his canvas, a box
and the easel all at once. The security door to the roof
shuts and suddenly Ben can’t move. The bottom of the
easel is stuck in the door.
He looks down to see the stairwell of the building
looming underneath. He tries to pull the easel past the
door, but it doesn’t move. Little drops of sweat start to
show on his forehead.
He gives up trying to do everything at once, and places
the canvas on the floor, then he kicks the door with his
foot. He is now able to get the easel past the door,
which closes with a loud clank.
He leaves the canvas behind, and carries the easel and
the rest with him down the stairs.
It’s still a lot to carry, and the place is dark. He
stops midway. A drop of sweat rolls down Ben’s forehead.
He gets nervous, and takes a deep breath. His eyes get
foggy, he has a hard time focusing them. The air gets
rarer. Ben feels faint, and takes a deep breath. The
stairs seem to move from under his feet.
First the easel drops, then the box, which opens and all
the painting materials roll down the stairs.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
In the waiting room of the hospital, Roberto, in his
policeman uniform, Kate and George are crowded around the
DOCTOR, all ears on each word he says.
DOCTOR
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket
joint;

CONTINUED:

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
the ball of the upper arm bone
fits into the socket in the
shoulder blade, and is kept there
by the rotator cuff. He had what
we call a full thickness tear, or
a complete tear.
Can he paint?

GEORGE

DOCTOR
No. I don’t want him to even comb
his hair for a while.
Poor Ben.

GEORGE

KATE
His legs are okay?
Legs are fine.

DOCTOR

KATE
It was so hard to get him to stand
up, and move. I thought he had
broken his leg, he was in so much
pain.
DOCTOR
He dislocated the shoulder, which
means his arm came out of the
socket, and that is very painful,
so any action, any movement with
the body, makes it even worse.
ROBERTO
What about surgery?
DOCTOR
I wouldn’t recommend it right
away. First he needs to rest.
We’re going to put his arm in a
sling, and he should just let it
rest for a couple of months. Then
we’ll try some strengthening
exercises and physical therapy.
Now, George, when was the last
time he had a full cardiac
checkup?
GEORGE
We have our regular checkup every
year.
(CONTINUED)

73.
CONTINUED: (2)
DOCTOR
You have to take him to see a
cardiologist.
Why?

GEORGE

DOCTOR
It’s not okay for anyone to be
having fainting spells, especially
not at his age.
ROBERTO
I thought he’d just fallen down
the stairs.
DOCTOR
No, he fainted.
GEORGE
He’s felt dizzy before.
DOCTOR
And shortness of breath?
GEORGE
Maybe. I think so. Did he complain
to you, Kate?
KATE
No. Doctor, finish, please.
DOCTOR
A heart condition would explain
the dizziness and the fainting
spells, and nowadays heart surgery
is so advanced... Anyway, I’m not
going to speculate here. I’m an
orthopedist, I’m not a
cardiologist.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
Ben, a large band-aid above his eye, his right arm on a
sling, is propped up on the couch with two pillows,
reading a book.
Kate comes from the kitchen with a glass of water, and
some medication.
KATE
Here. You should take this now.

(CONTINUED)

74.
CONTINUED:
Oh, thank you.

BEN

KATE
I have to leave, but there’s a
plate of pasta for you in the
microwave.
BEN
Thank you, Kate.
KATE
Are you sure you’re going to be
okay?
BEN
Oh yes, I’m fine.
Okay, then.

KATE

Kate grabs her purse, makes sure she has everything she
needs and walks to the door.
Bye bye now.
Bye.

KATE
BEN

The door closes behind her. Ben is alone in the
apartment. With some difficulty, he moves on the couch to
reach the medication and water. He drinks a couple of
sips, and takes a deep breath before slowly returning to
his previous position. He picks up the book and starts
reading again.
EXT. STREETS OF BROOKLYN - DAY
Kate approaches a corner with a stop light. She waits for
a couple of cars to rush by, but crosses the street right
after, without waiting for the light to turn. She
continues to walk fast, in a hurry to get somewhere on
time.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Kate crosses the street in a hurry and rushes inside the
gates of this private High School in Brooklyn - an old
big building, a place that exudes tradition and solid
education.

75.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL, THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY
A small room with books and files everywhere. Kate is
sitting on the guest chair in the Principal’s office. The
PRINCIPAL leans on her busy desk while talking to Kate.
PRINCIPAL
I don’t want you to worry too
much, it’s not a very big deal. We
deal with similar problems every
day here. But it is serious.
KATE
I’m shocked. He’s such a serious
kid, and such a good student. And
so is Vlad.
PRINCIPAL
There’s been some rivalry between
the two senior classes. It started
between two students, but then it
trickled down to everything from
who’s the most popular to who’s
the smartest. Maybe it’s something
related to this, but I don’t
really know. Did you notice
anything different?
KATE
No. Maybe. Actually, now that I
know this...
What?

PRINCIPAL

KATE
Last night he watched a DVD with
me. It was my pick - a French
movie, and Joey usually would
never sit for the whole thing. He
seemed very interested and stayed
until the very end. We even had a
conversation about it after. That
was sort of unusual.
PRINCIPAL
Vlad has confessed that he took
the books out, and gave them to
Joey, but your son denies having
them.
KATE
Vlad seems to have great influence
on my son. Joey doesn’t have that
many friends.
(CONTINUED)

76.
CONTINUED:
PRINCIPAL
Have you noticed any new books in
the house?
KATE
I haven’t paid attention. I’m
trying to finish my new book. And
Elliot’s Uncle Ben is staying with
us, sleeping in Joey’s room. It’s
a bit of a complicated situation.
PRINCIPAL
Well, I don’t understand why they
would steal these books, they’re
all French literature books.
KATE
I have no idea.
PRINCIPAL
Truth of the matter is that the
books need to be returned to the
library. You can tell your son we
won’t ask any questions now. But
if they’re not returned, Joey will
not be able to graduate. Do I make
myself clear?
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - END OF THE DAY
Ben, with his right arm in a sling, is lying on the
couch, trying to read a book; it is a hard cover French
edition of Cyrano de Bergerac. He doesn’t seem
comfortable, can’t concentrate.
Ben puts the book down, and raises from the couch with
some difficulty.
The sunset light comes through the window of the living
room. Kate’s desk is empty, neatly clean. All is quiet.
Ben goes to Kate’s desk, and punches a number on the land
line telephone.
BEN
George
(...)
After the operation, I think it’s
better if I go stay with Mindy.
(...)
Yes, George.

But it’s really not fair with
Elliot and Kate. And poor Joey.

BEN (CONT'D)
(...)
You’ll come on the weekends.
(...)
We should have an answer from
those places soon.
(...)
Why not?
(...)
Of course I trust you. But I want
us to have options.

The door suddenly opens and Kate and Joey come in. Joey
runs into his bedroom, without even saying hello, clearly
upset. The door slams shut.
Ben, still on the phone, looks on as Kate goes inside her
bedroom and shuts her door behind her.
INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
A tense dinner at the Hull home tonight. The family is
sitting around the table, their plates empty after
dinner. Ben is the only one still eating. It’s only
pasta, but having his right arm on a sling and trying to
use the left hand only doesn’t help.
ELLIOT
This is the last thing I expected
from you, Joey. The last thing.
You’re not a boy anymore, you’re a
man. You’re lucky this happened in
high school, so the principal can
call your mother. In the real
world, you would’ve gone to jail.
JOEY
But I didn’t steal anything.
A cell phone rings. It’s Elliot’s, and he picks it up.
ELLIOT
(on the cell)
Hello.
KATE
Ben, some more water?
Yes, please.

BEN

Kate serves Ben water, then herself. For a long moment,
there’s silence at dinner. Ben is slowly eating his food,
Joey plays with his fork, and Kate is observing Elliot,
who listens to the caller on the other end of the line.
(CONTINUED)

78.
CONTINUED:
ELLIOT
(on the cell)
No, let’s just go with what we
have. I don’t want to make changes
at this point.
Still more silence.
KATE
(to Elliot)
Can you do this later, please?
ELLIOT
(on the cell)
I can’t really talk right now, let
me call you back in half an hour.
Thank you.

KATE

Elliot hangs up his cell phone, and is lost for a moment.
Where was I?

ELLIOT

Ben looks around, mouth full of pasta - nobody but him
seems to remember. He chews and swallows.
Jail.

BEN

ELLIOT
Yes. You have a father and a
mother who taught you all that is
right and wrong. There’s no excuse
for this. Look at your mom. Look
at her! Do you think your mother
deserves to be called in the
middle of the day to hear that her
son is involved in some kind of
robbery? I mean, what’s going to
be next, carjacking?
Joey doesn’t answer. He’s done with dinner, he’s ready to
get up. But Uncle Ben’s plate is still full of pasta.
ELLIOT
Do you have anything else to tell
me?
JOEY
What do you mean?

(CONTINUED)

79.
CONTINUED: (2)
ELLIOT
If there’s something else, I’d
rather hear it from you now, than
later from the principal or
someone else.
JOEY
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
ELLIOT
When guys your age steal things,
there’s usually drugs involved.
No!

JOEY

ELLIOT
Is Vlad involved with drugs?
Dad... no.

JOEY

KATE
How are you feeling, Ben?
BEN
Oh, I’m fine. It’s a bit
challenging to maneuver the
silverware, but I’m fine.
ELLIOT
(to Joey)
You don’t sound very sure. Is he?
JOEY
Not that I know of.
ELLIOT
Not that you know of?? You’re
together all the time! The only
way I can understand why a boy
like Vlad would steal a bunch of
books in the French language is if
he were high.
JOEY
I’m done here, can I get up
please?
KATE
(to Joey)
You don’t want any dessert?

(CONTINUED)

80.
CONTINUED: (3)
I’m full.
Answer me!

JOEY
ELLIOT

JOEY
I don’t know, Dad! I’m not Vlad!!
They all want this dinner to be over. Silence at the
table.
JOEY
Can I go to my room, please? I
still have work to do.
ELLIOT
We haven’t finished eating.
Joey looks at Ben’s plate, the only one still eating. Ben
becomes self-conscious.
BEN
It’s okay, I’m almost done. I’m
sorry...
KATE
(to Joey)
Okay then. You can go.
Joey gets up and leaves.
ELLIOT
Unbelievable.
(to Kate)
You’re too nice to him.
KATE
You don’t even know.
Kate gets up and starts cleaning the table, taking the
dirty plates to the sink. Elliot follows, and looks for a
clean container for the leftover pasta.
Ben stops eating, and puts his fork down.
BEN
I know where the books are.
Elliot is rinsing dirty dishes in the sink, while Kate is
dumping bits and pieces in the garbage.
BEN
I said, I know where the books
are.
(CONTINUED)

81.
CONTINUED: (4)
Elliot and Kate stop what they’re doing, and turn to Ben,
who looks down at his plate, not able to face them right
now.
BEN
I’ve been in the house by myself,
unable to work, to paint or do
anything. I was looking for
something to read, and I found
these books under my bed, so I
picked one up.
KATE
Ben! Why didn’t you say something?
BEN
I didn’t think much of it. They
were just books.
ELLIOT
Are those the books?
BEN
The one I picked up was Cyrano de
Bergerac. My French is a little
rusty, but I got most of it. I
know the book so well...
KATE
Frankly, who cares, Ben?
ELLIOT
Those are the books.
KATE
(angry, to Ben)
You’ve been listening here the
whole time, you should’ve said
something!
ELLIOT
Calm down, Kate. He didn’t know.
KATE
You think I’m too nice to Joey?
ELLIOT
Oh please, Kate.
KATE
Well, let me tell you: you’re too
nice to your uncle, Elliot. And
it’s very easy being nice when
you’re not the one who’s around
all day.
(CONTINUED)

82.
CONTINUED: (5)
Kate drops the plates in the sink, and walks out. Elliot
follows her.
Ben, alone at the table can hear them knocking on Joey’s
bedroom door. He can hear the door opening and then a
loud BANG - the door slams shut. Kate’s and Elliot’s loud
voices, muffled. And Joey’s shouting, his voice full of
teenage emotion.
The rest of the food remains untouched on Ben’s plate. He
feels bad, and can’t really eat anymore. He can hear the
door slam open, and everybody’s voices loud and clear
now.
JOEY (O.S.)
Because we're the only ones who
will ever learn French and read
those books in this stupid school!
Including the dumb ass teacher!
KATE (O.S.)
That is so arrogant.
ELLIOT (O.S.)
Not even! It’s just plain stupid.
Suddenly, Joey bursts in the kitchen, his face red with
rage, his voice trembling with anger.
JOEY
What the fuck, Uncle Ben?!!
Elliot comes right after, and grabs Joey by the arm.
ELLIOT
Don’t talk like this to your
uncle.
JOEY
You guys talk like this all the
time!
ELLIOT
Say you’re sorry.
Joey is almost crying. Kate comes in, holding some books.
ELLIOT
Joey, you know you won’t graduate
unless these books are returned.
I’m sorry.

JOEY

ELLIOT
The trip to Paris this summer?
Forget about it.
INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A party at Roberto and Ted’s. The apartment is crowded
with people - men and women, friends of the couple chatting, drinking beer, laughing and being social.
George sits on the couch, alone, with a drink in his
hand, observing the scene. He sees in the corner of the
room TWO MEN having what seems to be a heated
conversation, which quickly turns into an argument. Some
people around them look on, and they realize that this is
not the place nor the time to be having this
conversation. They rest their case for a moment. One of
them, IAN, attractive, early 30’s, goes into the kitchen.
The other one, a MAN IN HIS 40s, is clearly upset. He
suddenly turns around and walks out the door. George
witnesses the whole scene from the couch.
Ian comes back from the kitchen with two beers, and walks
around looking for his friend. He looks and looks but
doesn’t find him. Disappointed, he ends up on the couch,
next to George.
IAN
Would you like a beer?
George notices a countryman in Ian’s heavy British
accent.
No, thank you.

GEORGE

IAN
I got an extra one for my friend,
and now I can’t find him.
GEORGE
I think he left.
Ian realizes George was witness to his scene with the
guy. He places one of the beers on the coffee table in
front of him, and keeps the other one, drinking a sip.
IAN
We had an argument.
(pause)
I’m Ian by the way.
GEORGE
George. I’m a friend of Roberto’s.
(CONTINUED)

84.
CONTINUED:
Who’s Roberto?

IAN

GEORGE
Well, I think this is his party.
IAN
Oh, right. I don’t know anybody
here.
GEORGE
That’s Ted over there. The cute
one. He’s Roberto’s boyfriend.
IAN
Yes, I met Ted. Not my type.
GEORGE
They’re both cops believe it or
not.
IAN
Really? Gay cops.
GEORGE
We call them the Police Women.
Ian laughs.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Terrible, isn’t it? But they are
actually both very nice. Roberto
is not here yet, he’s still at
work.
Pause. George has a sip of his drink. Ian looks on at the
people coming and going for a moment.
GEORGE
Where are you from?
IAN
Chippenham, originally. Near
Bristol.
GEORGE
South London, myself, but moved to
New York when I was a teenager.
IAN
Did you come alone?
GEORGE
With my mother.
(CONTINUED)

85.
CONTINUED: (2)
IAN
I mean to this party tonight.
Ah. Yes.

GEORGE

IAN
Do you live in Chelsea also?
GEORGE
For the moment, yes.
IAN
I live in the Village. I was on my
way to have dinner with my friend,
and he said let’s stop by this
party first. I said sure, and now
he left, and... well, here I am.
GEORGE
You must be hungry.
What?

IAN

GEORGE
I said, you didn’t have dinner, so
you must be hungry.
Starving. You?

IAN

GEORGE
Yes. Hungry as Rodolfo.
Rodolfo?

IAN

GEORGE
From La Boheme. The opera.
(pause)
Sorry, I don’t mean to be
pretentious.
IAN
Rodolfo the poet, of course. He’s
so hungry and poor that he burns
his own manuscript for fire.
That’s right.

GEORGE

Another pause. Ian looks at George, looking at the scene
in front of him.
(CONTINUED)

86.
CONTINUED: (3)
IAN
Should we go eat?
Right now?

GEORGE

IAN
Why not. I don’t have to stay
here. Do you?
Well, I...

GEORGE

IAN
Sorry, you don’t even know me.
It’s just that I hate to eat
alone. Don’t you?
GEORGE
No, on the contrary. I’m never
bored with myself, whereas people
sometimes can drive me crazy.
Ian gives no response - does that mean George wants to be
alone? He takes a sip of his beer, and George looks at
him.
GEORGE
Don’t get me wrong. I love people.
It’s crowds I have a problem with.
I prefer to relate one on one,
than to just stand there with a
drink in your hand, and a smile on
your face.
IAN
I know what you mean.
(pause)
Are you waiting for Roberto?
GEORGE
Not really. I don’t think Roberto
will miss me when he gets here.
IAN
Oh, you’re waiting for someone
else!
GEORGE
It’s not that romantic of a
situation.
IAN
So what are you waiting for?
(CONTINUED)

87.
CONTINUED: (4)
GEORGE
I’m waiting for the orchestra to
play its last note, so the curtain
can fall.
Are you high?

IAN

GEORGE
Hardly. Before I started talking
to you, I was about to doze off.
IAN
That’s not the best place to
sleep.
GEORGE
And yet, you’re sitting on my bed.
George looks at the people coming and going, as Ian looks
at him. A moment of recognition in Ian’s face.
IAN
You’re homeless!
GEORGE
(laughing)
Yes, it’s a long story. It starts
with me marrying my partner of 39
years and getting fired. We’re
looking for a place we can afford,
but I won’t bore you with details.
IAN
Well, I happen to have, right here
in my pocket, the key to a rent
controlled apartment on Morton
Street in the West Village, soon
to be vacated.
How come?

GEORGE

IAN
It’s a long story. Should we go
eat?
George, a bit reluctant, looks on to see that Ted is in
the middle of a loud group, drinking and laughing. The
party goes on, and they won’t miss him.
IAN
C’mon. I don’t feel like staying
here, and neither do you.
(CONTINUED)

88.
CONTINUED: (5)
Ian gets up and walks away.
Already close to the door, Ian stops and turns. He sees
that George is coming after him.
INT. APT. IN THE WEST VILLAGE - NIGHT
A small but very comfortable, cozy living room of an old
apartment in the West Village. The place feels well lived
in, very quiet, functional, with personality. George
looks around, and Ian picks up a few items that were out
of place.
IAN
My uncle used to live here before
me, so after he moved back to
England, I got the lease from him.
That was 20 years ago, and I’ve
been very happy here. I love this
place.
GEORGE
So why are you leaving?
IAN
Because of work. I got a job with
the Anthropology Museum in Mexico
City.
GEORGE
That’s an amazing place.
IAN
You’ve been there. So you know it
doesn’t get much better than that
for an archaeologist. Do you want
something to drink?
Just water.

GEORGE

While Ian goes away to get some water, George looks at
the books and pictures on the shelves along the wall.
Pictures of Ian in a Mayan city in Central America, in
Paris, and Ian with the older guy seen at the party, in a
romantic embrace on a beach.
Ian comes back with water, sees George looking at the
picture.
GEORGE
That’s the guy.

(CONTINUED)

89.
CONTINUED:
IAN
Yes, John. We’ve been going out
for about a year. I told him about
Mexico tonight, and he wasn’t
happy.
GEORGE
You’re a heartbreaker.
IAN
On the contrary. When I first met
him, I was so in love, I didn’t
want to leave his side. Unlike
many gay men, I’ve never been
afraid to show my feelings. So I
think I scared him off a little.
He never wanted to commit, really,
and kept pushing me away. It’s no
coincidence that I interviewed for
this job in Mexico. Now he finds
out that I’m leaving and he
decides that I’m the man of his
dreams? It’s so typical, and so
disappointing, frankly.
George goes to the window, to see the view.
IAN
Do you know how much I pay here?
No idea.

GEORGE

IAN
I’m even embarrassed to say.
Eleven hundred. They can’t raise
the rent too much. It’s controlled
by the city.
GEORGE
Bless this city.
Outside, the faint light of old lamp posts illuminate a
large, beautiful internal patio - one of those oldfashioned buildings. A sense of peace fills George, and
he smiles.
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
A SINGER sings in Latin a beautiful, solemn piece of
music. He is accompanied by a PIANIST and a few OTHER
MUSICIANS on this elegant stage.

(CONTINUED)

90.
CONTINUED:
The small theatre has an intimate feeling, the audience
is composed of music lovers of all ages: MUSIC STUDENTS
and OLD TIMERS mixed with NOVICES who came to listen to
Durufle’s music for the first time.
Amongst them are Ben and George, dressed in jackets and
ties - Ben with a bow tie, stylish even if his arm is in
a sling (a dark blue sling that goes with his dark blue
tie).
The music takes a romantic turn. Ben looks at George - he
knows that’s his favorite part. George keeps his
attention on the stage, but brings his hand down to
George’s side, as they discreetly hold hands.
EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
A small crowd of serious CONCERTGOERS come out from the
side door to the Concert Hall. Ben and George are amongst
them.
They walk down the street, George is humming the music.
BEN
So what did you think?
GEORGE
Not bad, though she was milking it
a little.
BEN
Did you think so?
GEORGE
With a piece as romantic as that
you don’t need to embellish.
BEN
I don’t know. I loved it. I kept
thinking about him and his beloved
Isabella.
GEORGE
That’s not true, though. That
whole he-wrote-it-to-convince-herparents-to-let-him-marry-her,
that’s a myth, you know.
BEN
I’m not like you, though. I prefer
a little embellishment.

91.
INT. JULIUS BAR - NIGHT
George and Ben are on stools at the bar. George tries to
catch the BARTENDER’s attention, with no success. They
are a little out of place among the mostly young and hip
PATRONS.
More YOUNG PEOPLE start to arrive, chatting, flirting,
moving around.
The Bartender comes to help Ben and George.
Finally.

GEORGE

BARTENDER
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. You guys
look very thirsty. What can I get
you?
GEORGE
Scotch on the rocks for me. Vodka
tonic with half a lime and no ice
for the gentleman here.
Ben smiles, George knows him well.
GIRLS flirt with GIRLS who dance with BOYS who flirt with
BOYS.
The Bartender brings the two drinks.
GEORGE
How come it’s so busy here
tonight?
BARTENDER
Thank God it’s Friday!
GEORGE
(to Ben)
The kids have taken over our spot.
Good for them.

BEN

BARTENDER
Are you guys new in the
neighborhood?

(CONTINUED)

92.
CONTINUED:
BEN
Are you kidding? There was a
famous “sip in” that happened
right here, in this bar, to
challenge the New York State
regulation that prohibited bars
from serving homosexuals.
BARTENDER
Sure, we have a clipping from The
New York Times framed here
somewhere.
Ben points the finger to himself.
BEN
1966. Me and four other guys. We
came here accompanied by five
reporters, and when we were denied
service, we denounced the State
Liquor Authority.
BARTENDER
Oh my God! You’re the guy?
BEN
I’m one of the guys.
BARTENDER
Wow. This round is on me, fellows.
The Bartender goes to help other Patrons. George and Ben
pick up their drinks, and turn their backs to the bar.
They try to hold it in, but soon start to laugh.
GEORGE
You’re such a liar!
What?!

BEN

GEORGE
You’ll do anything for a free
drink!
BEN
But I knew the guy who did the sipin.
Frank?

GEORGE

BEN
That was his claim to fame.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
GEORGE
(raising his
eyebrows)
I thought his claim to fame was
something else.
BEN
Oh, that too. God bless him.
George raises his glass.
BEN
Here’s in memory of Frank.
They toast and drink up.
And to Ivan.

BEN

GEORGE
And who is that?
BEN
The angel from Chippenham who got
us the apartment.
It’s Ian.

GEORGE

BEN
Ivan, Ian, doesn’t matter. I’ll
drink to him, the handsome
stranger.
GEORGE
Do I hear some jealousy in your
voice?
BEN
I have wondered what you’ve been
doing with all your free nights
without me.
GEORGE
That’s not for me, Ben. You know
that.
BEN
For all these years?
GEORGE
For all these years.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
BEN
Amazing. I’m sorry I can’t say the
same to you, George. But at least
I’ve always been honest.
GEORGE
Sometimes I think that ignorance
would have been a lot easier.
BEN
I’m sorry, George.
George takes a long sip, observing the young people
around them.
GEORGE
(softening)
But now that I think about it,
some things you couldn’t have
hidden even if you wanted to.
BEN
What are you talking about?
GEORGE
I’m talking about the time you got
crabs.
BEN
Oh, thanks for reminding me.
GEORGE
And a black eye, that night in
Rio.
BEN
That was a crazy motherfucker
trying to rob me!
They laugh. George raises his glass.
GEORGE
To all the strangers!
BEN
Particularly the ones that bring
us a rent controlled apartment in
the Village. Cheers.
A toast, and the party goes on.
The CROWD drink and flirt, swaying to the beat of the
music, a happy bunch.

95.
EXT. WEST VILLAGE - NIGHT
Ben and George walk silently side by side on the quiet
streets of the West Village at night.
As they’re about to cross the street, Ben stops for a
moment, taking a deep breath. George notices it, and
holds his arm.
Are you okay?

GEORGE

BEN
Felt a little dizzy.
GEORGE
Too much to drink.
BEN
Yes. I’m fine now.
George lets go of Ben’s arm, and they cross the street.
Side by side, they walk on a side street towards 6th Ave.
George.
What?

BEN
GEORGE

BEN
Remember we used to go to Castelli
and Mary Boone, and you’d say that
one day we’d go there to see my
one man show?
And we will.

GEORGE

BEN
No, we won’t, George.
GEORGE
How do you know? Nowadays you read
about a new “hot artist” every
week.
BEN
Okay, maybe it will happen but not
in my lifetime.
GEORGE
How do you know? It’s all a matter
of taste, and trends.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
Some new curator might look at one
of your paintings one day and
think it’s the greatest thing.
BEN
I just would like to know. Is that
disappointing to you?
GEORGE
Not at all. I say it because I
believe it’s a real possibility,
but it’s not important to me. I
love your paintings, and I don’t
really care what other people
think.
BEN
I guess I did make a couple of
good ones, didn’t I?

They arrive at the Subway Station by the Waverly Diner on
6th Avenue.
BEN (CONT’D)
We’ve had our ups and downs,
George, and I know I wasn’t always
the best husband to you.
GEORGE
I’d rather be your husband, Ben,
than anyone else’s in the world.
And if I had a chance to go back
in time, I would live the same
life all over again. I wouldn’t
change a thing.
George takes Ben’s hand, and they walk down the Subway
Station.
INT. SUBWAY STATION / 6TH AVE - NIGHT
There’s minimal traffic this time of night inside the
station. Even then, maybe out of habit, George and Ben
find a dark, private corner to say goodbye, next to an
empty ticket booth.
It’s time for them to separate for the night. They reach
out to embrace each other, made only slightly awkward by
the sling on Ben’s arm.
Ouch.

BEN

(CONTINUED)

97.
CONTINUED:
Sorry.

GEORGE

BEN
Careful with my arm.
A YOUNG COUPLE walks by, without noticing them.
They walk towards the entrance to the trains. Ben passes
though the turnstile with his card.
BEN
Good night George.
Night, Ben.

GEORGE

George watches as Ben waves and disappears down the
platform.
FADE OUT.
EXT. STREETS OF WEST VILLAGE - DAY
George walks alone on the not so crowded streets of the
West Village, crossing South on 7th Avenue.
EXT. STREETS OF WEST VILLAGE / COURTYARD BLDG. - DAY
George turns the corner into a very quiet, tree lined
street in the Village.
He arrives at the old brick building, and goes through
the gate.
EXT. COURTYARD BLDG. - DAY
The sun reflects on the freshly watered garden, which is
nicely landscaped and well taken care of. The old
building surrounding this central courtyard is low, only
5 stories high. The place is quiet, and has a sort of a
monastic feeling.
As George crosses the yard towards the entrance to the
left, he doesn’t notice a young man coming from the other
side.
Hey, George.

JOEY (O.S.)

It is Joey, carrying a shopping bag and a skateboard.
(CONTINUED)

98.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
Joey! I didn’t see you.
JOEY
I was waiting over there.
GEORGE
Let’s go up. I want you to see the
new place.
INT. APT. IN THE WEST VILLAGE - DAY
The same apartment seen before, but now with George and
Ben’s furniture spread around, their books and objects on
the shelves, Ben’s painting on the wall, and George’s
piano occupying center space in the room.
Joey is by the window, looking at the courtyard below.
Here.

GEORGE (O.S.)

George brings in two glasses of ice tea.
JOEY
This place is so nice.
GEORGE
I know, thank you. I got lucky.
JOEY
And really close to the river too.
The new park is awesome.
GEORGE
It’s changed so much. When I first
moved to New York, that was a no
man’s land. Look at it now.
Joey drinks his ice tea, as George goes to sit on the
piano seat, with his own tea cup.
They remain in silence for a few moments, an awkward
intimacy between them.
JOEY
George, I’m sorry I didn’t go to
the service.
The service?

GEORGE

JOEY
Uncle Ben’s service.
(CONTINUED)

99.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
Oh, it’s okay. Funerals can be
strange. Especially for people
your age.
JOEY
I wanted to remember Uncle Ben
like I remember him now. I’ve
never even been to a funeral
before, and I was afraid that if
I’d gone to his, that would always
be what I remembered when I
thought about him.
GEORGE
That makes a lot of sense to me,
Joey. I hope you didn’t come all
the way here just because you felt
guilty about it.
JOEY
No. Actually, I came because I
wanted to give you something.
Joey goes into the shopping bag he brought, and takes out
a painting. It is The Skateboarder, the painting that Ben
made of Vlad.
George walks closer to the window, where the light is
brighter and he can see better the unfinished painting.
As if holding a piece of Ben in his hands, his eyes tear
up.
GEORGE
Wow, that’s very nice.
JOEY
I picked it up at the top of the
stairs the day Uncle Ben had the
accident on the roof. It was funny
because everything fell down to
the bottom of the stairs,
including Uncle Ben, as you know,
but the canvas was neatly placed
on top, as if he had had the time
to save it before coming down.
GEORGE
You know that’s very possible. His
paintings meant everything to him.
I think that when he realized he
couldn’t use his arm after the
operation, he gave up. The heart
was just a consequence. Is that
the view from your roof?
(CONTINUED)

100.
CONTINUED: (2)
JOEY
Yes, it’s South.
GEORGE
Is that you here?
No.

JOEY

GEORGE
I didn’t think so.
JOEY
That’s my friend Vlad. He’s a
friend who used to come over a lot
when Uncle Ben was living with us.
GEORGE
You sure you don’t want to keep
this? It’d be a nice memento.
JOEY
No, it’s his last painting, it’s
unfinished. You can look at it and
always imagine what he would’ve
done with the colors here.
GEORGE
Nice. Very nice. Let me get a
hammer, so you can help me hang it
on the wall.
EXT. COURTYARD BLDG. - DAY
JOEY’S GIRLFRIEND sits on a bench in the middle of the
courtyard, with a skateboard by her side, playing with
her smart phone. She sees someone approaching, and gets
up. Joey comes to greet her. He holds her hand, and they
start to walk away, each holding their own skateboard.
INT. APT. IN THE WEST VILLAGE - DAY
George watches the young lovers from the window.
After a moment, he turns around and sees himself alone in
the apartment. He walks to the Skateboarder painting,
looks at it and tilts it a tiny bit, making sure it’s
squared on the wall.
EXT. MORTON STREET - DAY
The quiet street is covered by an arc of trees.

Joey’s girlfriend drops her skateboard on the asphalt,
jumps on board, and rolls towards the river. Joey comes
surfing by, and catches up to her. They roll side by
side, towards the setting sun.
