EXT COUNTRYSIDE
A carriage crosses the landscape.

INT CARRIAGE DAY

A man in a military uniform with one arm. Inside the
carriage,(think overloaded modern taxi) seven or eight people
are crammed in. ABIGAIL, an open, friendly innocent woman is
crushed to the side. She clutches a dirty purse and a letter
in her hands. Two kids, snot streaming from their noses,
cough TB into the air. The military man smiles at her. She
smiles back empathetically, then notices his other arm
jiggling. She looks down. He has his hand inside his pants
and is jerking off.
Must you?

ABIGAIL

INT PALACE COURTYARD / SF GATE DAY

3

A shout and the carriage stops. Abigail gets up. Stands and
yanks the door open, a man grabs her arse. She pulls away but
trips and launches off the edge of the carriage falling face
first into the mud.
She grabs her bag. Looks up at the castle before her. To her
right soldiers are standing around a fire warming themselves,
a few amputees.

EXT KITCHEN

The servant’s entrance to the busy kitchen of the castle. At

Abigail steps through into the busy basement kitchen.
MRS MEG
Grab a hunk of bread. Sally will
take you to clean up and then to

They head up the stairs. And through a door.

INT HALLWAY / A&E

DAY

8

They walk along the hallway, wooden, lined with rugs.
Beautiful, ornate and opulent.
Abigail stares at her surroundings. She sniffs herself, aware
of her stench.
ABIGAIL
This mud stinks.
SALLY
They shit in the street round here.
Political commentary they call it.
Sally opens a door.
SALLY (CONT’D)
Go through here. Clean yourself up.
ABIGAIL
Thank you so much.
Abigail goes through. Sally shuts the door behind her with a
smile.
Abigail in darkness, finds herself behind a thick curtain.
She fumbles her way and pushes through it to find...

INT DRAWING ROOM

DAY

GODOLPHIN, MARLBOROUGH and SARAH staring at her.
SARAH
I didn’t know the new sewer ended
in here.
Godolphin and Marlborough laugh.
ABIGAIL
Lady Marlborough.
She curtseys.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
It is I Abigail. Dear cousin. I had
a letter from our aunt and... I’m
sorry, I did not to mean to present
as a ... I fell out of the
carriage,.. and a man was pulling
his... never mind the man. My
letter from our aunt...

She holds out the mud soaked letter but stops, flustered, as
two flies arrive to buzz around her.
SARAH
Friends of yours?
ABIGAIL
I am sorry... I.
She shoos at them.
SARAH
Your name girl. If we are blood,
name it.
ABIGAIL
Oh. I did not... Abigail Hill.
SARAH
The Somerset Hills?
GODOLPHIN
The one who went mad and burnt his
own house down, himself in it.
MARLBOROUGH
Lost all his money at whist.
GODOLPHIN
No one bets on whist.
SARAH
My uncle was one of a kind.
ABIGAIL
I apologise for my appearance I do.
The staff led me here. A harmless
prank of some sort I suspect.
SARAH
And you want?
ABIGAIL
I hoped I might be employed here by
you... as something.
SARAH
A monster for the children to play
with perhaps?
ABIGAIL
Yes. If you like.
She raises her hands and makes a ‘Gggrrr’ sound. They smile
at this. Sarah considers her.

SARAH
Go back to that gouty old slattern
Mrs Meg and tell her I said to give
you quarters, food and something to
do. Take your flies with you.
Abigail, thrilled, curtsies, turns and fights her way back
through the curtain. They are all amused.
9A

INT ANNE’S APARTMENTS

DAY

9A

Queen Anne stands, crown on her head, regal cape on. From
behind her hands reach up and remove her crown. Another maid
undoes her cape and takes it. Sarah watches on. They leave.
Anne limps to a chair.
ANNE
How was my speech?
SARAH
You were brilliant.
ANNE
Did I have a lisp?
SARAH
You don’t lisp.
ANNE
I know that’s what was troubling
about it. The thought I suddenly
did.
Sarah, you must say hello to the
little ones.
No.
Please?

SARAH
ANNE

Sarah looks over at the fenced off hay-filled pen that
contains seventeen white rabbits.
SARAH
It is macabre. I love you but that
I will not do.
ANNE
If you love me...
SARAH
Love has limits.
ANNE
It should not.

INT SECRET PASSAGE

5.

DAY

10

ANNE waits. Breathing a little bit fast. Sarah steps in.
Through the darkness Queen Anne and Sarah walk. Anne puts a
blindfold on Sarah, she starts to bump into walls. Anne
laughs and rights her.
They get to a door. Anne uses the key which is around Sarah’s
waist. Finds the lock, slides the key in, turns the lock, the
door opens.
11

INT SARAH’S APARTMENTS

DAY

11

Sarah stands in front of a model of Blenheim Palace. Anne
watches on excitedly as she removes the blindfold. A model
sits there. Sarah considers the model and walks round it.
SARAH
You do not lisp but you are mad.
Giving me a palace?!
ANNE
I’ve been wanting to get you
something for a while. It seemed a
good opportunity. Marlborough
winning. Were the Tories alright
about it? I couldn’t tell.
They stare at each other through the apertures of the model.
A moment between them. Sarah shakes her head.
SARAH
It is a monstrous extravagance Mrs
Morley. We are at war.
We won.

ANNE

SARAH
It is not over. We must continue.
ANNE
Oh... I did not... know that. Well
Mrs Freeman, you will... be clever
as keeper of the privy purse... and
afford it.
12

INT GREAT HALL

EVENING

12

The men and women of the court (COURTIERS) and some of the
politicians (WHIGS & TORIES) mill about having drinks. A man
carves bloody slices off a roasting elk (CARVING MAN), its
head still intact. Marlborough addresses the group.

THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 (BLUE REVISIONS 14 MAR 17)

6.

MARLBOROUGH
Gentleman! Ducks!
We see a makeshift ring has been fashioned out of chairs and
upturned tables. Godolphin holds a duck, he lets it go at the
same time a tory next to him does the same. Money is thrust
to a CENTRAL BOOKIE (TORY) who holds bets. The ducks race to
cheers.
Sarah enters, grabs a glass of wine off a FOOTMAN (3) who is
holding a tray of them. Her husband looks over at her. She
nods hello.
HARLEY walks up beside Sarah.
A palace!

HARLEY

SARAH
You seem angry at my good fortune.
And I thought we were friends.
HARLEY
I really doubt you’ve made that
mistake.
SARAH
Well I was actually just teasing. I
thought you’d see that.
HARLEY
It will not stand.
SARAH
Well it will if I build it using
the best craftsmen in the land. I
hope it will stand for a hundred
years as a symbol of my husband’s
gallant victory.
HARLEY
And I applaud your husband’s
gallant victory. However
considering the parlous state of
the treasury, it seems something
the Queen should have taken advice
from the loyal opposition on.
SARAH
But then it would’ve lost that
delightful surprise element. You
know like Christmas morning? If St.
Nicholas bills you first it loses
its frisson.

THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 (BLUE REVISIONS 14 MAR 17)

7.

He stares at her. Building to something.
Cunt!

HARLEY

SARAH
And there I was expecting something
witty that rhymed.
An ‘Aaah’ goes out from the crowd. Godolphin and Marlborough
approach. Godolphin leading a duck.
GODOLPHIN
Horatio has done it again.
Sarah warmly squeezes Marlborough’s hand as he settles beside
her.
HARLEY
Prime Minister we need to discuss
who will go to the French with the
peace treaty proposal.
SARAH
We do not need a peace treaty. We
have them on the run.
HARLEY
So they will give in to us.
GODOLPHIN
One battle will not win the war.
HARLEY
I have held my party together, as
we the country landowners have
essentially paid for this entire
war.
GODOLPHIN
And grateful we are.
HARLEY
While city merchants have enriched
themselves from it.
MARLBOROUGH
Yet I do not see your fat tweedy
dead when I look out on the field
of battle.
HARLEY
We are out of money. My point.
GODOLPHIN
We will raise taxes again.

THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17

8.

HARLEY
You would be wise to rethink that
Godolphin. I helped unite
parliament for this. I will not do
it again.
SARAH
The French are chastened but not
defeated Harley. We must destroy
them. Make them sue for peace, with
broken backs and begging hearts.
HARLEY
What a sweet wife you have
Marlborough.
MARLBOROUGH
Sweet. And right.
HARLEY
I cannot agree. We must take it to
the Queen. If you would be kind
enough to arrange a time Lady
Marlborough.
She nods.
Of course.

SARAH

INT SERVANTS’ QUARTERS

NIGHT

13

An empty room of stone. A dozen Female Servants are crammed
in. Dressed in sleeping wear, they smoke, drink, some try and
sleep.
Abigail enters and looks around for somewhere to sleep,
stepping over people’s feet. A servant (GIRL WITH GLASS)
pushes her and she falls, knocking the drink out of Sally’s
hand. Abigail crawls apologetically to some space in the
corner.
Abigail curls up on the floor. Closes her eyes. A splash of
liquid hits her face. The others laugh. She doesn’t even
bother to open her eyes to see what it is.
14

INT. SERVANTS’ QUARTERS DAY

14

A row of naked servants including Abigail, all various ages
and shapes. Sally soaps up armpits and crotch, then passes
the soap to the next. Abigail, takes the soap, finding it
utterly distasteful. An old woman with a large bucket throws
water at them. Very cold water. Abigail grimaces.

INT GOLDEN HALLWAY

9.

DAY

15

A hallway. A FOOTMAN (2) outside a door. Sarah waits. Anne
enters from her rooms, dramatic dark make up around her eyes.
ANNE
I am ready for the Russian
ambassador.
SARAH
Who did your make up?
ANNE
We went for something dramatic. Do
you like it?
SARAH
You look like a badger.
Oh.

ANNE

Her eyes start to tear.
SARAH
You’re going to cry? Really?
She stops her. They look in a mirror.
SARAH (CONT’D)
What do you think you look like?
ANNE
(sadly)
A badger.
Sarah smiles ruefully.
SARAH
And do you really think you can
meet the Russian delegation looking
like that?
She shakes her head.
SARAH (CONT’D)
I will manage it. Go back to your
rooms.
She nods sadly.
Thank you.

ANNE

Sarah walks off. Anne walks back toward the Footman (3). He
looks straight ahead.

ANNE (CONT’D)
Did you just look at me! Did you?!
He shakes his head no. Looks at the ground.
ANNE (CONT'D)
Do not avert your eyes! Shut them!
He shuts them. She goes back into her rooms.
16

INT KITCHEN

16

DAY

The busy, bustling kitchen. Maids scurry. Cooks cook.
In a corner piles of Dishes and dirty caked on plates in
front of her. Steaming hot water in troughs. Abigail works on
the dishes. Sally comes in carrying a bucket and brush.
Morning.

SALLY

ABIGAIL
(bright and friendly)
Oh hello. I was thinking of playing
cards later if you would like to
join me.
SALLY
Sounds brill. The old bag says you
are to scrub the floor until she
can see her toothless fat face in
it.
She hands her the bucket full of liquid.
Sorry.

SALLY (CONT’D)

Abigail shrugs. Gets down on her hands and knees. She plunges
her hand in the bucket. Intense pain shoots through her hand.
She pulls it out.
SALLY (CONT’D)
You might need gloves. Lye is
dangerous. It burns bad.
Abigail writhes in pain. The girls laugh and saunter off as
she sticks her burning hand into a sink of cold water.
17

INT KITCHEN

NIGHT

17

The kitchen is quiet. A few servants work but it’s late.
Abigail works her way through the dishes in the near empty
kitchen, the red raw pain in her hand excruciating. Mrs Meg
rushes in. Sees Abigail.

Anne is lying on the floor, her leg raised up on a chair.
Sarah is there, examining Anne’s foot. Anne screams. Footman
1 brings a bottle of brandy past hurriedly. The QUEEN’S MAID
stands by as the QUEEN’S DOCTOR examines her leg.
Mrs. Meg motions to her, Abigail puts the bucket down.
Sarah glances briefly at Abigail, The Doctor, who is laying a
leech on Anne’s leg. She flinches.
Sarah!

ANNE

SARAH
I’m here. I’m here.
Brandy!
She pushes a shot of brandy to Anne’s trembling lips.
Abigail watches on.

THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 (PINK REVISIONS 23 MAR 17)

They hurt.

12.

ANNE

SARAH
I know my dearest I know. The beef!
Mrs Meg uncovers the bucket to reveal thin slices of raw
beef. Abigail starts laying the slices on her leg. Anne
screams.
SARAH (CONT’D)
Gently cousin.
Abigail nods. The Queen focuses on Abigail for a second, then
a new wave of pain comes on her. Anne closes her eyes
grimacing.
SARAH (CONT'D)
(to Anne)
It’s alright. Tell me a story.
(to Mrs Meg and the
Doctor)
You two may go.
(to Abigail)
You, start wrapping that.
Mrs Meg and the Doctor nod and exit. Abigail wraps the leg in
bandages. Anne, Sarah and Abigail are left there. But to
Sarah it’s just her and Anne.
ANNE
I... can’t. I...
SARAH
How we first met. Tell me that.
Come on.
Anne struggles to focus, but tries.
ANNE
The... wretched... Cheever boy had
me down on the ground and was
holding me... dropping spittle in
my face.
SARAH
He is still a pig. Then what?
Blood leaks through some pores. She mops it up.
Then what?

ANNE
I heard footsteps, fast footsteps,
and saw these pink shoes running
towards me...

ANNE (CONT'D)
.. and then they disappeared and I
heard a crack. And then he fell off
me, and I looked over and... ughh.
SARAH
Remember how his jaw just hung
there?
ANNE
I do. You took my hand and said
‘Hello, I’m Sarah. You’re covered
in spittle. Let’s wash you off’.
They laugh. Abigail is awkward at being present to this
private moment.
SARAH
You must try to sleep.
Anne nods. She clasps Sarah’s hand.
SARAH (CONT’D)
(to Abigail)
You may go.
She goes.
ANNE
Don’t leave.
I won’t.

corner. She raises her hand and unwraps the bandage to see
it, blistered and sore.

Pre dawn. Abigail passes a sleeping groom by the stable door.
24

EXT PARK

24

MORNING

A forested area. Abigail, one hand on the reins, races
through the dawn light.
She comes to a halt, breathless and happy for a moment. She
dismounts the horse and scans the forest floor for a
particular plant. Upon finding it, she breaks off some
leaves. She crushes the leaves with a stone on another stone
and then unbandages her hand, places the pulp against her
blisters and redresses her hand. She reaches down and bundles
together some more leaves before getting back on her horse.
Through the trees, she spies a handsome Equerry in his
twenties, MASHAM. His eyes are closed and his head rests on
his horse’s neck. He looks peaceful. Abigail watches him,
transfixed. Suddenly his eyes blink open and he looks
straight at her.
She kicks her horse and shoots away.

the night before guarding the door.
ABIGAIL
For the Queen. The doctor has
ordered it immediately. It is a
matter of extreme urgency
FOOTMAN 1
She’s sleeping.
ABIGAIL
Shall I tell the doctor you
imperiled the Queens health and let
you rue the ramifications.
FOOTMAN 1
What does ramifi...mean.

THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 (BLUE REVISIONS 14 MAR 17)

ABIGAIL
It means he will have you whipped.
He nods, waves a hand to let her through. She goes into the
Queen’s bedroom.
27

INT ANNE’S APARTMENTS

DAY

27

Anne lies sleeping, snoring slightly. Abigail examines her
legs. They are still inflamed. She removes the dressing,
pulls out the leaves she found on her ride and places them
gently on her legs. Anne stirs a little.
Sarah enters. Stares at her.
SARAH
What are you doing?
ABIGAIL
I am... I... these are peleatis,
the herb. I cut them this morning.
They remove swelling and
inflammation. I saw them and I
thought it may help the Queen.
SARAH
You cannot just walk in here! Why
did the footman let you through?
ABIGAIL
I lied to him. It is not his fault.
I just wanted to help her. She
seemed to suffer so much.
Sarah sees a group of three military men, Godolphin and
Marlborough enter at the far door. She nods to them.
SARAH
Footman take her downstairs. Tell
Mrs. Meg she is to receive six of
the birch. Go!
Abigail is stunned. She nods and walks with the footman 1 out
past the entering men.
Sarah goes to the woozy Anne.
SARAH (CONT’D)
You must focus Anne. Much is at
stake.

We gather forces here. The

Anne focuses on the map.
ANNE
Is that... which country again?
Listen!

SARAH

She hits the map with the pointer.
SARAH (CONT’D)
Marlborough.
MARLBOROUGH
This is the town of Lille, in a
valley. We lure them in by sending
a small force to engage them. They
give chase. We descend in numbers
from above them.
Hear hear.

GODOLPHIN

Others concur.
SARAH
It is a brilliant plan. Queen Anne,
you agree?
ANNE
The people expect it to be over.
Sarah takes her hand.
SARAH
We all want it over, but wishing
does not make it so Anne. We could
sue for peace, but we will not get
it.
ANNE
It does help.
They turn. Anne stirs. She sits up woozy, as if slightly
drugged.
ANNE (CONT’D)
Something soothing on my legs, it
takes the burn out. What is it?
SARAH
Oh. Herbs. Of some sort.

He takes her to a side bench by the wall. Pushes her over it.
MRS MEG
Do her in the barn if that is what
is, not in my kitchen.
FOOTMAN ONE
Her Ladyship says six of the birch
for this one.
Mrs Meg shrugs and nods.
He pulls down the back of Abigail’s dress to reveal her bare
back.
Mrs Meg goes to the corner and gets a hard stick of birch.
The other girls stand around eating biscuits, excited for the
show.
Abigail focuses on a smiling Sally.
Mrs Meg lifts her arm and lashes the birch across her back.
Abigail flinches.
SALLY
She really is a lady, look how soft
that skin is.
Mrs Meg pulls her arm back, strikes her again.
Stop!

DAY

Sarah and Abigail in a small hallway off the kitchen.
SARAH
So you are perhaps too kind for
your own good.
ABIGAIL
It has been said.
SARAH
Which leads to stupidity. But the
Queen is soothed somewhat so I
thank you. You shall get me more of
those herbs. And not overstep
again.
ABIGAIL
Yes Maam. My father always spoke
highly of you.
SARAH
I liked your father, he had charm
to burn.
And then I guess he did.
Abigail nods.
SARAH (CONT’D)
You have fallen far.
ABIGAIL
Yes. When I was fifteen my father
lost me in a card game.
SARAH
You are not serious?
Abigail
Oh he was very upset about it. Took
off into the forest with nothing
but a scullery maid and a dozen
bottles for solace.
SARAH
And you went?
ABIGAIL
We honour our debts. They would
have hurt him.

SARAH
Foolish. A woman should not let
herself be chattel.
ABIGAIL
I wanted to do right by my father.
The debt was to a balloon shaped
German man with a thin cock.
Thankfully I managed to convince
him a woman has her blood in twenty
eight days a month.
Sarah considers her, notices her bandage hand.
SARAH
What happened to your hand?
ABIGAIL
Some of my colleagues are immune to
my charms.

DAY

31

Mrs Meg opens a door. Abigail enters a cell like room
containing a single bed, a small table and a wash basin.
Abigail puts her battered bag on the floor. She can’t believe
it. She is thrilled and bounces on the bed. Her own room.
Mrs Meg leaves with a leer. Abigail goes and shuts the door
and notices there is no lock.
32

INT HALLWAY / CG

DAY

32

Abigail, now dressed in a new dress, walks along the halls
with Sarah. Sarah carries a document with the royal seal on
it. A chubby aristocrat, EARL STRATFORD, sees Sarah and heads
toward her.
SARAH
Earl Stratford, do not come near me
whining today or I will crush your
tiny heart to liver.
He backs off.
A French woman elegantly dressed, MADAME TOURNEE.
SARAH (CONT’D)
Madame Tournee. You may have the
tapestry budget you have asked for.
Spend one penny more and I will
take your finger nails in lieu.
Merci.

SARAH
The Queen will ride on Tuesday
morning.
MASHAM
Yes, Lady Marlborough.
He loiters.

Would you like a bite of my new

He bows, a small smile exchanged between he and Abigail, and
departs. Sarah sees the smile between them.

Godolphin and Harley sit on couches smoking. Horatio sits

HARLEY
You should know, I have canvassed
my party. They are waiting for us
to announce an attempt at peace.
GODOLPHIN
We shall both make our case to the
Queen.
Harley stabs his pipe out, infuriated.
HARLEY
Where is the Queen? We have been
waiting an hour.
Sarah enters with Abigail.
I’m here.

SARAH

HARLEY
Might I remind you, you are not the
Queen.
SARAH
She has sent me to speak for her.
She is unwell.
Abigail goes to a side table set with cakes. She starts
cutting a piece.
GODOLPHIN
What says she?
SARAH
That Harley is a fop and a prat and
smells like a ninety six year old
French whore’s vajuju.
HARLEY
I really doubt you’re quoting.
SARAH
She has decided to continue with
the war. She feels another victory
in will put us in a stronger
position for a treaty. Her letters.
She places a folded document with the royal seal on the
table.
HARLEY
And how are we to pay for this?
Abigail delivers the cake.
SARAH

She relies on you and your love of
England to hold the Tories
together.
HARLEY
There are limits.
SARAH
To love of your country? To me
there is no limit on that. Our last
farthing to protect England if we
must.
HARLEY
And our last man too? The dead pile
up as do the resentments. Or that
does not concern you?
SARAH
I grieve them all, in my heart a
scar for each, and I send my own
beloved with them, chest bared. So
do not lecture me on the cost. You
do not count the cost in men until
you need something heavy to toss on
the scales with your greed.
HARLEY
A treaty would save money and
lives. A win for all Englishman.

We go to them after one victory,
they know we are scared. We bury

You will need to pay for the repair
of that. We have a war to finance.
Every penny counts.

Come on, old bean. One more

the time it takes for a treaty

Harley ignores him, just staring angrily at Sarah. Suddenly
Harley runs at Sarah, stopping just in front of her. She
doesn’t flinch. His breath is ragged, she breathes calmly. He
breaks and storms from the room.

A middle aged man (MUSIC TEACHER) directs them. He has a

doing what they should. But it’s beautiful and fresh, joyful

Anne and Abigail watch through the window, entranced. Then
Anne becomes melancholic, a reminder of her own losses.

HARLEY
May I speak a moment, with Her

the chamber to roar a mighty hurrah
for Her Majesty in her brilliant
decision to not raise the land tax.
There is a hurrah from the Tories. Anne is thrown a bit.
HARLEY (CONT’D)
For the doubling of the tax would
have been a disaster, and the
fields would have run with blood as
the countryside rose up against our
city friends. To add to the piling
dead of our sons on the field of
this war. Again to our Queen for
her deep wisdom in knowing where to
draw the line in holding our
country together. For there is no
point winning a war abroad if we
are to start one at home.

More scurrying and a sound like the cry of a wolf. She drops

He grabs at her. She pulls away. Stands, her crotch at his

He starts to push her dress up.

What man?

When we drove through town. He
stared at me in such a way. I felt
my blood chill.
Abigail takes a cup of tea over to Sarah.
So kind.

SARAH

Sarah drinks her tea. Takes a petit four, tosses it in the
air and catches it in her mouth.
Abigail smiles at Sarah, unnerving her.
ANNE
Abigail. Do you think people are
angry?
SARAH
Anne! She does not know.
ANNE
We should ask people. Bring a group
of people from the villages in and
ask them.
SARAH
That is not how matters of state
are dealt with. People are led,
they do not lead!
Would you leave Marlborough
exposed? He needs another battalion
ready to join him. And that means
money.

Do not yell at me! I am the Queen!

Then for once act like it!
Sarah walks out.

EXT WOODS

DAY

Sarah is galloping through a wooded area.
Sarah suddenly doubles over with pain, a flop sweat breaking
out across her face. She pulls the horse to a walk. Sarah
blinks hard trying to pull herself together. She suddenly
throws up.
The horse starts to gallop. She pulls listlessly at the
reins.
Her bowels suddenly open noisily. She topples over. Gets her
foot caught in the stirrup. The horse gallops on as her head
hits the ground and she is dragged, unconscious.

INT GOLDEN HALLWAY

Abigail walks the hallway determinedly. Shrieking, giggling

INT DRAWING ROOM

DAY

A group of painted up Tories including Harley have a young
man naked (POMEGRANATE TORY) and are playing dodgeball with
him, using pomegranates as balls. The wall is spattered
bright pink. The young man tries to dodge but gets hit with
one. He goes down and they all slam more pomegranates into
him.
Abigail appears in the doorway.
The men all yell lewd things at her.
A pomegranate juice spattered Harley comes to her.
ABIGAIL
I have thought on the terms of our
friendship.
HARLEY
I thought it was unconditional
love.

ABIGAIL
I will get you an audience with the
Queen if you ask her a favour for
me.
HARLEY
Wench. You willABIGAIL
Harley you do not need me as an
enemy. As it turns out I am capable
of much unpleasantness.
As am I.

HARLEY

ABIGAIL
(angrily)
It’s so tiring to be like this!
(calmer)
The Queen has taken a shine to me
and I will drip poison into her ear
regarding you, until she is mad
with hatred for you. Or we will
have a mutually advantageous
friendship. Count of three. Yes or
no?
He stares at her.
HARLEY
If you are so close to the Queen,
why not just ask this favour
yourself?
ABIGAIL
I do not want her to ever think I
want anything from her.
HARLEY
And have you counselled her for our
side?
No.

ABIGAIL

HARLEY
Why not? The country’s future hangs
in the balance.
ABIGAIL
Uh huh. My thing is what I wish to
talk about.
HARLEY
You do not care? I thought you were
on our side.

it is a happy coincidence for you.

save the country.

NIGHT

The horse walks through the woods. The woods are thicker now,
darker.
In the moonlight they pass a man fucking a woman against a
tree. The woman MAE, watches impassively as the horse drags
Sarah past her. The man pulls up his pants and goes.
Mae leaves her tree, walks, takes a look at Sarah, then takes
the horse’s lead and leads it away, Sarah dragging along
behind it.

Harley walks beside the Queen.

Abigail watches on from a distance.
HARLEY
You do not like the war. I know
that.
ANNE
No. I do not. But we must...
fight... for what we fight for.
HARLEY
Godolphin and Lady Marlborough seem
to have corralled you, so that you
do not get to hear from your loyal
opposition.

I am briefed appropriately.

I am often ill.

HARLEY
True. Sadly true. The war with the
French will bleed us dry even if we
win. We are in our strongest
position now. If Marlborough loses
this next battle we could lose all.
Anne takes this in for a beat.
HARLEY (CONT’D)
The people hate the war you
realise. They begin to hate you.
Anne is quiet as she considers what Harley is saying.
HARLEY (CONT’D)
Lady Marlborough has not told you
of the riots in Leeds?
ANNE
No. But there was a man with one
eye that was...very distressing.
HARLEY
All I ask is that you search your
heart.
Of course.

her sips from a flask of whisky.
SARAH

MAE
You’re in heaven. That’s God.
You’ll meet him later.

Sarah tries to get up but throws up over herself.

HARLEY
I apologise. I hope we find her,
and she is not dead in a ditch. The
business of state however cannot
stop. The Prime Minister has a
ludicrous and costly idea toGODOLPHIN

word from the front in two weeks.
There is no doubt that Marlborough
is in trouble. We need to send a
division immediately to help him.
HARLEY

your paranoia and walking into God

Beat. Anne nods, but struggles as to what to do. Abigail
suddenly speaks up from her position seated at the wall.
ABIGAIL
Is it somewhat like going late to a
party. If the party’s going well,
they did not need you and resent
the intrusion. If it is going
badly, you cannot save it, but tend
to get excruciatingly bored and
regret you ever put on your nice
gown for it.
They look over at her.
GODOLPHIN
It is not like a party!
ABIGAIL
I’m sorry Prime Minister, a passing
thought.
ANNE
I think it is like a party.
HARLEY
A perfect analogy.
ANNE
We will wait. But they should be in

scabbed over.

He looks at up her. Shrugs.
KEVIN
Mae says no.
SARAH
I’m leaving. Help me up.
KEVIN
Shut up. Or I’ll give you something

Sarah stands up. He stands up. He pulls a hard leather cosh
out of his pocket, lazily smashes the cup that sits on a
table next to him. Stares at her.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Mae says no. Mae says no.
SARAH
Why don’t you think for yourself?
KEVIN
I can hurt you if I have to. She
said. But I get to decide if I have
to. So that is thinking for myself.
Mae enters the room.
MAE

SARAH
Is my horse alive or did you eat
it?
MAE
I sold it. Still didn’t pay for
your upkeep. But you look better.
Don’t worry about the face, some

ABIGAIL
She is strong. She will be fine.

She seems devastated.
ABIGAIL
That is not true. You are the

I am tired. It hurts, everything
hurts. Everyone leaves me. Dies.
Finally her.
She closes her eyes for a beat. Then suddenly opens them. An
anger in them this time.

If she is not dead, I will cut her
throat. She may be trying to hurt

Suddenly takes the letters and throws them in the fire.
A Courtier (SPEAKING COURTIER) enters.

The Queen requests the return of

She presses her forehead on the door.
SARAH (CONT’D)
I will not come back. Do you
understand! I will go and be gone!
Abigail has done this.
She does not love you!
ANNE
Because how could anyone? She wants
nothing from me! Unlike you.
SARAH
She wants nothing from you, and yet
somehow she is a Lady with two
thousand a year, and Harley sits on
your knee most nights.
ANNE
I wish you would love me as she
does.
SARAH
You wish me to lie to you?!
‘Oh you look like an angel that

Some days you look like a badger.
And you can rely on me to tell you.

I have. I have over the last

Abigail goes and gets a silver dish of the paste. She wobbles

No.

Abigail starts massaging the paste into her legs..

and is slightly surprised to see she is surrounded by a dozen
members of the cabinet. Harley holds court.
HARLEY
Now that the peace with France has
been madeA cheer goes up from half the cabinet. Godolphin looks glum.
HARLEY (CONT'D)
Marlborough’s return back to
England is imminent. I wonder Your
Majesty whether it is right that he
is left as head of our forces?

Godolphin is outraged.
GODOLPHIN
He is a hero who won the peace for
us!
HARLEY
Indeed. But he would have launched
us into a bloody war that would
have ruined us. So there’s that.
GODOLPHIN
We have made a poor peace that we
will rue.
Anne grunts and tries to compose herself, sit up. Sally comes
and picks her arm up and places it on the pillow on her lap.
Harley forges on.
HARLEY
Well, our people are happy. I
suggest, Queen Anne, that as a
gesture of our graciousness to
France perhaps he should be stood
aside? A new era of peace and
prosperity, a new day, a door to a
new future, metaphors abound.
GODOLPHIN
It will look like we surrendered
and the palace will be surrounded
with men who lost eyes and arms in

their leader.

They will stare in at us with rage.

Quite. Lady Marlborough is a woman
of passion. Perhaps she behaved
rashly and is apologetic for her
behaviors?
ANNE
You know this?
GODOLPHIN
I... believe it to be so.
Anne takes this in.
GODOLPHIN (CONT’D)
Her love and loyalty to you and
this country are her reasons for
living. Perhaps she could write you
and we could attempt to repair at
least one wound in our Queen?

it is pointless and I would dash

I am of course, perhaps mistaken in
the bookkeeping. Sometimes all
these numbers are dizzying. And
they often do add up on second or
third attempt. They are as fickle
as humans. A simple explanation I
am not seeing. We shall banish it
from our minds. We should take the
