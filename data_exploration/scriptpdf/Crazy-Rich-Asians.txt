INT. CALTHORPE HOTEL - CLOSE ON A PORTRAIT - NIGHT
of a modern ENGLISH LORD. The brass placard reads:
“Lord Rupert Calthorpe-Cavendish-Gore.”
REVEAL we’re in the lobby of an ostentatious hotel. It’s
deserted except for TWO CLERKS at the front desk. It is
the middle of the night and RAINING HEAVILY outside.
ANGLE ON HOTEL ENTRANCE
The revolving doors start to swing as TWO CHILDREN (NICK
8, ASTRID 8) and TWO CHINESE WOMEN, ELEANOR and FELICITY
YOUNG (30s) enter. They’re DRIPPING WET, dragging their
soaked luggage behind them.
Nick SLIDES his feet around the polished floor, leaving a
MUDDY CIRCLE in his wake. The clerks look horrified.
Eleanor makes her way to the front desk, while
complaining to Felicity about having to walk in the bad
weather.
ELEANOR
(in Cantonese;
subtitled)
If you didn’t make us walk, we
wouldn’t be soaked.
Felicity grabs the children by the hand and follows
Eleanor to the front desk.
CLERK #1
May I help you? This is the
Calthorpe, a private hotel -(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Eleanor goes to the desk and replies in PERFECT ENGLISH -her pronunciation is BRITISH, with a lilt unique to uppercrust Chinese from former British colonies.
(NOTE: The specific accents of our players are important
character details, indications of their background,
education, and socioeconomic status.)
ELEANOR
I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. I have a
reservation. The Lancaster suite.
(sees his name tag)
We spoke on the phone when I
confirmed yesterday.
CLERK #1
Sorry, don’t seem to have your
reservation.
Clerk #2 surreptitiously presses a BUTTON under the
counter. Eleanor and Felicity exchange glances.
Felicity rolls her eyes, sensing what’s going on.
REGINALD ORMSBY (50s, pompous) pops out of a door behind
the front desk and the clerks move aside.
ORMSBY
Good evening. I’m Reginald
Ormsby, hotel manager. Is there a
problem?
ELEANOR
I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. My family
and I would like to be shown to
our suite. We’ve had a long
flight.
Ormsby takes in Eleanor et al, makes a snap judgment.
ORMSBY
We’re fully booked, madam. You
must have made a mistake. I’m
sure you and your lovely family
can find other accommodations.
May I suggest you explore
Chinatown?
FELICITY
(in Cantonese;
subtitled; mutters)
You can explore Hell. You dog
turd.

(CONTINUED)

3.
CONTINUED:

ELEANOR
Please, may I use your phone to
call my husband? It’s the least
you can do.
Eleanor levels a glare at Ormsby, who looks at her with a
tight smile.
EXT. CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT
RAIN POURS on the children and Felicity as they watch
Eleanor in a PHONE BOOTH. “THE CALTHORPE” sign casts a
glow over them. We don’t know what she’s saying, but we
hear Eleanor angrily speaking on the pone.
INT. CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT
Eleanor bursts through the front door with her family
right behind her. Eleanor approaches the front desk
again. Ormsby is not pleased.
ORMSBY
Mrs. Young! I must ask you to
leave, or I’ll have to call the
police.
ELEANOR
Please, go right ahead.
Ormsby is taken aback. He moves to stop her when the
elevator DINGS and OPENS and an ELDERLY MAN IN A SILK
ROBE AND SLIPPERS comes out -- LORD CALTHORPE, the same
man in the opening portrait and owner of the hotel.
Ormsby snaps to.
ORMSBY
Lord Calthorpe! My apologies for
this disturbance -Lord Calthorpe ignores Ormsby and beelines for Eleanor.
LORD CALTHORPE
Eleanor! I just got off the phone
with your husband.
Lord Calthorpe kisses Eleanor on the cheek, and snaps at
the clerks.
LORD CALTHORPE
Get the Lancaster suite ready.
Now.
Ormsby reacts, confused.
(CONTINUED)

4.
CONTINUED:

ORMSBY
Surely you’re joking, sir.
LORD CALTHORPE
I assure you, I’m not. As of this
evening, my family’s long history
as custodians of the Calthorpe is
ended. I am selling the hotel to
my dear friends, the Young family
of Singapore.
Ormsby looks at Eleanor, shocked.
LORD CALTHORPE
Meet the new lady of the house,
Eleanor Young.
(to Eleanor)
Join me for a toast.
ELEANOR
We’d be delighted.
(turns to address
Ormsby)
Do get a mop. The floor’s wet.
Eleanor winks at Nick, who grins and looks back at
Ormsby.
ORMSBY
(to Clerk #1)
Get a mop.

RACHEL
All right, so, how did I beat T.A.
Curtis so very, very badly? Well,
I know for a fact that Curtis is
cheap.
The students all smile and laugh, totally engaged.
RACHEL
So, he’s not playing using logic
or math, but using his psychology.
Our brains so hate the idea of
losing something that’s valuable
to us, that we abandon all
rational thought and make some
really poor decisions. So Curtis
wasn’t playing to win. He was
playing not to lose.

INSERT - MAP OF SINGAPORE
CUT TO:
INT. PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - MORNING
ELEANOR reads a Bible verse aloud to a group of ladies.
ELEANOR
‘If then you have been raised with
Christ, seek the things that are
above, where Christ is seated at
the right hand of God.’
It’s been twenty years since we’ve seen Eleanor, but she
looks amazing. She sits with FOUR FABULOUSLY DRESSED,
BEJEWELED WOMEN: JACQUELINE LING (50s), ALIX YOUNG
(50s), NADINE (30s), AND LORENA (40s). Uniformed MAIDS
serve tea and “kuih,” local cakes.
ELEANOR
‘Set your minds on things that are
above, not on things that are on
Earth.’
Eleanor’s interrupted by BUZZING. She looks disapproving
as Alix and Jacqueline check their messages.
These matriarchs speak with UPPER-CRUST CHINESE
SINGAPOREAN ACCENTS (perfect grammar with local
flourishes). Jacqueline reacts, surprised.
JACQUELINE
Eleanor, is Nicki bringing a girl
to Colin’s wedding? My Amanda
heard it from her friend,
Francesca...
Eleanor is surprised, but tries not to let on.
ALIX
(looking at phone)
Eddie says her name is Rachel Chu?
NADINE
Oh! I thought that Nick was
coming alone. Did you know he had
a girlfriend?
All eyes are on Eleanor who covers, not wanting to get
into the details.

CONTINUED:

ELEANOR
Nick dates many girls.
to keep track.

It’s hard

JACQUELINE
Amanda knows everyone and she has
never heard of her.
NADINE
Rachel Chu. Or maybe she’s from
the Taiwan plastics Chu family?
ALIX
(low; conspiratorial)
If you want, I have a private
investigator. Very discreet -ELEANOR
(interrupting)
I think we should return to the
word of God. Alix?
The women reluctantly return to their Bibles.
ALIX
Ephesians. Chapter six, verse
four. ‘Bring up your children in
the discipline and instruction of
the Lord.’
(can’t help herself)
Oh, I do hope she’s a good,
Christian girl.
JACQUELINE
Well, if he’s bringing her home,
it must be serious.
NADINE
Exactly.
The women all look at Eleanor.
INT. CAKE & CARRY - NIGHT
RESUME Rachel and Nick.
It’s my mum.

Nick’s phone rings.
NICK
Do you mind?
RACHEL

Mm, go ahead.
Rachel is about to dig into pudding #2.
(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED:

NICK
(to Rachel)
All right. Save me some of that.
RACHEL
Okay.
Nick gets up to take the call away from the counter.
NICK
(into phone)
Hey, Mum, everything okay?
ELEANOR (V.O.)
Does something have to wrong for
me to call?
NICK
Yeah, usually.
Ha, ha, ha.

ELEANOR (V.O.)
Very funny.

INT. PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - DAY
Eleanor is on her phone standing away from her Bible
group. Keeps her voice low, casual.
INTERCUT AS NECESSARY with Nick and Eleanor talking on
the phone.
ELEANOR
Are you bringing the girl you’re
seeing to Colin’s wedding?
NICK
(confused)
Hmm. We were literally just
talking about that. How could you
know?
ELEANOR
Everybody knows.
Nick sees Celine (the only other Asian in the restaurant)
leaving through a revolving door.
NICK
Radio One Asia.
Eleanor notices the other women trying to eavesdrop.

(CONTINUED)

13.
CONTINUED:

ELEANOR
(to ladies)
Move on to Corinthians, I’ll catch
up.
ALIX
Ah, yes.
ELEANOR
(back to phone; low)
We’re looking forward to having
you home. And your room is all
ready... for you.
Nick hears this, gets the implication.
NICK
Thanks, Mom. But Rachel and I
will be staying together.
Eleanor is disappointed, makes another attempt:
ELEANOR
I see. Well, I’m having the house
redone. And it’s not ready for
guests. If Rachel comes, I think
she might be more comfortable
staying somewhere else?
Nick returns to the counter, to see the second sticky
toffee pudding is gone, except for a TINY PIECE.
All right.

NICK
Sorry about that.

RACHEL
I saved you a piece.
NICK
You did, did you? A very small
piece at that. Thank you very
much.
RACHEL
How’s your mom? Everything okay?
Mm.

NICK
Couldn’t be better.

Rachel kisses nick.
RACHEL (V.O.)
(pre-lap)
Hey, Mom, this one’s kind of cute.

14.

INT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY
Rachel looks at her reflection in a mirror as she holds a
blue and white dress to her body. Her mother, KERRY
(50s, real estate agent, Chico chic), shakes her head.
Kerry has a slight Chinese immigrant accent.
RACHEL
What do you think?
KERRY
No! No! No! No! You can’t wear
that to meet Nick’s Ah Ma. Blue
and white is for Chinese funerals.
Now this, this symbolizes good
fortune and fertility.
Kerry holds up a conservative RED dress.
RACHEL
Great! I was really going for
that ‘lucky baby-maker’ vibe.
KERRY
Hey! You are the one who asked
for my help picking out a dress to
meet Nick’s family.
RACHEL
It’s only ‘cause I hardly know
anything about them. Every time I
bring them up Nick changes the
subject.
KERRY
Maybe he’s embarrassed. Maybe his
parents are poor, and he has to
send them money. That’s what all
good Chinese children do.
Rachel chuckles and they keep searching for the right
dress.
KERRY
Oh, you are going to have a
wonderful time. You’ve always
wanted to go to Asia and who
knows, if all goes well in
Singapore, you might just come
back with a souvenir.
RACHEL
Mom, stop! Nick and I haven’t
even talked about that.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED:
RACHEL (CONT'D)
I mean, his parents can’t not like
me, right?

Kerry has a sour look on her face and turns away to begin
rummaging through a clothes rack.
RACHEL
What was that look?

I saw that.

KERRY
Nothing. It’s just, Nick bringing
a girl all the way there to meet
them can mean a lot to these
overseas families. Eh, they’re
different from us.
RACHEL
How are they different? They’re
Chinese, I’m Chinese. I’m so
Chinese, I’m an economics
professor with lactose
intolerance.
KERRY
Yeah, but you grew up here.
(in Mandarin;
subtitled)
Ni kan qilai shi huaren, ni jiang
de shi zhongwen. Keshi zheli he
zheli... [Your face is Chinese.
You speak Chinese. But here...
(points to Rachel’s
head and mouth)
... and here...
(in English)
You’re different. But wearing a
lucky color will make a good first
impression.
CUT TO:
EXT. JFK - CURBSIDE - DAY
Amid the hectic bustle, Nick and Rachel exit a taxi. An
airport sign behind them reads: Kuwait Airways, Pacific
Asian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Malaysian Airlines, Cathay
Pacific.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Attention, the white zone is for
passenger loading and unloadings
only.

RACHEL
Okay, game plan. Check our bags,
get through security, and then we
could eat one of the three
homemade Tupperware meals my mom
packed for us.
An elegant PACIFIC ASEAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ATTENDANT
approaches, flanked by TWO PORTERS with luggage carts.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Good afternoon, Mr. Young, Ms.
Chu. We’ll take your bags and get
you checked into first class.
NICK
Great.
Rachel looks confused as the porters take their bags.
RACHEL
Oh. No, there's a mistake. We're
not first class. We’re economy
people.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
This way, please.
Nick puts a hand in the small of her back:
NICK
Just go with it. Come on.
RACHEL
But...
NICK
Yeah, they’ll be fine.
them there.

Just leave

INT. PLANE - ON NICK - DAY
FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 pulls back a gold, silk curtain
revealing a luxurious part of the plane that looks more
like a hotel. Another attendant serves them champagne.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2
Welcome aboard, Mr. Young, Ms.
Chu. Here’s the way to your
private suite. And some
champagne.
They walk up to a full bar where champagne is poured for
them. Rachel turns to Nick like “what’s going on?”
(CONTINUED)

17.
CONTINUED:

NICK
(to serving flight
attendant)
Thank you.
Rachel is blown away to see the leather armchairs, two
huge flatscreen TVs, even a full-length wardrobe.
NICK
Thank you very much.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2
You’re welcome. After takeoff,
would you like to enjoy the lounge
chairs or should we convert your
suite into a bedroom?
Rachel clobbers Nick with a bag to keep him from
responding.
RACHEL
Uh, we’re good. Thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2
Enjoy.
Nick looks to Rachel.
The Flight Attendant leaves. As Nick settles in, Rachel
looks at the complimentary pajamas.
RACHEL
Nick. We can’t afford this.
These pajamas are fancier than any
of my real clothes.
NICK
Hmm? My family has business with
the airline. The tickets, they’re
a perk.
Rachel senses there’s more to this.

Pursues it:

RACHEL
What kind of business?
NICK
Real estate, investment, other
things. Nothing interesting.
(reading menu)
Dim sum.
RACHEL
So your family is, like, rich?
(CONTINUED)

18.
CONTINUED:

NICK
Uh, we’re comfortable.
RACHEL
That is exactly what a super rich
person would say. It’s not a big
deal, obviously. I just think
it’s kind of weird that I had no
idea. I mean, you have a Jamba
Juice card, you use my Netflix
password. You play basketball at
that Y that kind of smells.
Nick sees Rachel is a little thrown.
NICK
I really like that place, thank
you very much. And yes, my family
has money, but I’ve always thought
of it as theirs. Not mine.
RACHEL
I get that. But I’m going all the
way over there to meet them...
Kind of just wanna know what I’m
getting into. And, you know,
they’re your family.
NICK
Well... My family is much like
anybody else’s. There’s half of
them that you love and respect,
and then there’s the other half.
RACHEL
Which half am I meeting?

INT. MOVIE SET (TAIWAN) - NIGHT
A HERO faces off against a VILLAIN. In the b.g., a BUXOM

ACCENT.
KITTY
Alistair. You like it? I was

Can you feel it?
Kitty grabs his hand and places it forcefully on her
boob.
ALISTAIR
Oh, I can feel all of you.
all of me.

And

Alistair grabs Kitty’s left thigh and yanks it up onto
his hip. The DIRECTOR and Hero/Actor have an aside. On
the back of the chair “TAIPEI TIGER 2.”

NICK
Well, Eddie is a big finance guy

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (HONG KONG) - MORNING
Eddie, his wife FIONA CHENG (30s, Hong Kong Chinese, in a
simple but elegant dress), and their three sons (all
under 8 and wearing matching Gucci outfits) are frozen in
“natural” poses -- Eddie and Fiona “laugh” as their boys
“play” with wooden airplanes that look more like props
than toys -- as photographer RUSSELL WONG takes their
portrait. Behind them, wide, floor-to-ceiling windows

RUSSELL WONG
Uh, then we’re done.
As Russell wraps up, Eddie scurries over, all smiles.
EDDIE
Russell, thank you so much. It’s

you.
FIONA

FIONA
Thank you, Russell.
Eddie beams, but the moment Russell and his ASSISTANTS
exit, Eddie loses his smile. Turns on his wife, annoyed.
EDDIE
Hong Kong Vogue? I knew it. Your
dress is a disaster. If you wore
a Bottega gown, like I told you
to, we’d be in the American Vogue.
FIONA
You can wear that gown to Hell,
Eddie.
Fiona walks off as the children jump into 2 TOY BENTLEYS

Then there’s Astrid.

RACHEL
I remember Astrid. She’s like who

But her mother waves her away, busy looking over baubles

LITTLE GIRL’S MOTHER
No, not now, not now.
But the customers, including the Little Girl’s mother,
soon notice Astrid and sneak looks and whisper to one
another about her.
Astrid walks by them and goes to the Little Girl, much to

RACHEL
So, if you have all this family

NICK
Well, because A) I’m not that good

EXT. TYERSALL GROUNDS/AUDI - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
In the middle of nowhere, a MASSIVE GATE looms with
TYERSALL PARK written across the top. The gate is
closed. The guard on the walkie walks to the gate
looking back at Peik Lin and Rachel.

As Peik Lin drives through the gates, she and Rachel look
around, entranced. STREET LIGHTS/LANTERNS illuminate
both sides of the large driveway, which seems to wind
endlessly up through a hilly rainforest. Unlike the rest
of developed Singapore, it feels old, untouched. Peik
Lin has her mouth hanging open, amazed.
RACHEL
Oh, my God, it’s beautiful.
The forest finally gives way to rolling grounds and an
avenue lined with tall palms. A VAST COLONIAL MANSION
comes INTO VIEW. This is not a house, it is a palace.
PEIK LIN
Beautiful? It’s two hundred mil
worth of real estate.

... It’s spectacular.
They drive up to the front of the house. Servants are
posted in various locations outside. Two of the servants
open the front doors and Nick, in a linen suit and
perfectly-tousled hair, walks out. Looking every bit the
prince of the manor.

The DISTANT JAZZ RIFF CONTINUES as we ENTER a bustling
scene with MAIDS plating food, choppers chopping veggies

CHILDREN sneaking snacks. Amidst it all is Eleanor in
Carolina Herrera, presiding over everything. She
inspects various dishes, dispatching orders with calm

She’s clearly used to running a great house and being
obeyed. She pauses when she sees Nick enter. She’s
delighted, but keeps her composure.
Nick gives his mother a peck on the cheek.
NICK

Eleanor affectionately touches his hair.

the conversation to inspect a tray of hors d’oeuvres.

Self-made woman. She must be so
proud of you.
Eleanor continues fiddling and fussing with the table,
inspecting the food, coldly turning her back on the
couple.
RACHEL
Well, she knows that I’m
passionate about what I do, and
she’s always wanted that for me.
ELEANOR
Pursuing one’s passions. How
American. Well, your mother is
very open-minded, not like here,
where parents are obsessed with
shaping the life of their
children.
It sounds like a compliment, but Rachel isn’t entirely
sure. Eleanor turns away again to talk to a passing COOK
before returning to Rachel:
Eleanor shoots Nick a look. He shifts, uncomfortable,
and is relieved to hear a MUSICAL GONG from upstairs.
Hmm.

Oh.

NICK
That’s dinner.

ELEANOR
Hmm. Go ahead. I’ll be out in a
minute. Rachel, it was lovely
meeting you.
Thank you.

She takes a little minute to warm

Rachel is uncomfortable with the implication.

Oh, speaking of the grande dame...
Rachel turns to see guests make way for an elderly lady,
Nick’s AH MA (80s). She’s regal, elegant, but frail,
leaning on Eleanor to help her walk. She doesn’t say a
word, but everyone, her own family included, acts in
total deference and respect to her.

Ah Ma enters with her Thai maids. Oblivious to the
tension, she smiles to see Nick and Rachel.
NICK
Ah Ma.
ASTRID
Ah Ma.
ALIX
Ah Ma.
NICK

Thank you.

arm)
Ah Ma.
AH MA
Oh, Nick.
NICK
Come and sit.
AH MA

O, Nicki. O, ni ba Rachel ye

Ah Ma looks at Rachel’s face, scrutinizing it.

Rachel is unsure what to make of it, but it feels like
approval.

Sit, sit, grandson.

Right, right. We're almost done

Ah Ma looks at the dumplings.

[You made those dumplings? They
don’t look very good. You lost
your touch.]
Astrid watches this exchange, then looks at Rachel.
ELEANOR
Hmm.
INT. TYERSALL - HALLWAY - DAY
Rachel exits the dining room, looking for anywhere to go.
She walks up the long staircase, takes a few steps one
way, realizes she’s going the wrong direction, then turns
around to find Eleanor standing in front of her.
RACHEL
(surprised)
Oh. Hi. I think I’m a little
lost. This house is pretty big.
Eleanor comes to Rachel and they walk and talk through
the halls of Tyersall.
(CONTINUED)

96.
CONTINUED:

ELEANOR
I’m glad I found you. I’m afraid
that I’ve been unfair.
RACHEL
Oh, no, you know what? I'm sorry
I made an assumption. I didn't
mean to offend you.
ELEANOR
Not at all.
(then)
You asked about my ring. The
truth is Nick’s father had it made
when he wanted to propose to me,
because Ah Ma wouldn’t give him
the family ring. I wasn’t her
first choice. Honestly, I wasn’t
her second.
RACHEL
Gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no
idea.
ELEANOR
I didn’t come from the right
family, have the right
connections. And Ah Ma thought I
would not make an adequate wife to
her son.
Rachel is surprised how Eleanor is seemingly opening up.
RACHEL
But, she came around, obviously.
Eleanor gives a tight smile.
ELEANOR
It took many years, and she had
good reason to be concerned.
(off Rachel)
Because I had no idea the work and
the sacrifice it would take.
There were many days when I
wondered if I would ever measure
up -Eleanor pauses, looks at Rachel.
ELEANOR
But having been through it all, I
know this much...
(gets close; gently)
You will never be enough.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Rachel is eviscerated. Eleanor draws back, placid, calm.
Then, as if they’ve been talking about the weather
Eleanor walks off:
ELEANOR
We should head back. I wouldn’t
want Nick to worry.
INT. CAR - DAY
Nick drives as Rachel sits in the passenger seat, silent.
NICK
You all right?
RACHEL
Yeah.
NICK
I know my mum can be tough at
times, but there isn’t anything
she wouldn’t do for me...
(off Rachel’s
silence)
And there is a reason why I lived
with Ah Ma growing up. It’s
because my mother knew she wasn’t
the favorite. So she let her
raise me so I would be.
RACHEL
You were just a kid?
NICK
Yeah. But... It's hard to
understand from the outside. But
she did what she thought was best
for the family... For everyone
involved.
Rachel hears the tiny reminder of her otherness.
RACHEL
Mm-hmm.
Rachel takes it in, hears Nick’s regard for his mother.
Which makes her feel even more unsettled.
NICK
Anyway, I think I've had enough
with dumplings for the rest of my
life. What should we do? Sushi,
movies, anything you like.
Really.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - PATIO - DAY
Wait, what?

PEIK LIN (O.S.)
Was she like --

TILT DOWN -- Peik Lin and Rachel sit at a table.
PEIK LIN
(Eleanor impression)
‘You will NEVER be good enough for
my son,’ OR was it like, ‘YOU, YOU
will never be good enough for my
son.’
RACHEL
It’s like the second one.
PEIK LIN
Oh.
RACHEL
Except for in a way that made me
wanna, like, cry and puke at the
same time.
PEIK LIN
God, she’s so badass.
(idea)
You know, I bet if you told her
you’d leave Nick for a million
dollars, she will write that
check. They do that around here -RACHEL
-- And she looked at me like I was
nothing...
PEIK LIN
-- Like a ten million dollar
check. I feel like she would do
that.
RACHEL
I don't even know what I should
do. I mean, I can't even tell
Nick because he like worships her.
PEIK LIN
Yeah, Chinese sons think their
moms fart Chanel No. 5. What
about the Ah Ma? Does she hate
your face, too?

(CONTINUED)

99.

RACHEL
Okay, nobody said they hated my
face. And Ah Ma, she liked my
face. She said I had a lucky
nose.
PEIK LIN
That’s great! You know, Eleanor
can hate you all day long, but you
can’t beat two thousand years of
Chinese filial piety.
RACHEL
I feel like I shouldn't even go to
the wedding. You know, it's Colin
and Araminta's day, I don't wanna
cause any drama there. I feel
like I should just sit it out.
You know? Tell Nick I had food
poisoning or something.
(off Peik Lin’s look)
What?
PEIK LIN
That’s bullshit. You’re just
scared.
RACHEL
No, I’m not.
PEIK LIN
Okay, here's what you need to
understand, all right? It's not
about getting Eleanor to like you.
It's about getting her to respect
you. All right? Right now, she
just thinks you're some like
undeserving, clueless, golddigging -RACHEL
Okay, yeah, I got it.
PEIK LIN
-- trashy, unrefined banana,
yellow on the outside, white on
the inside -RACHEL
I know what a banana is -PEIK LIN

Eddie trails off as the photographers suddenly head to --- a custom GOLD BENTLEY MULSANE. It’s driven by Peik
Lin, who wears a fetching driver’s uniform. Seeing the
car, Oliver steps up as Peik Lin opens the door -- a
shapely stilettoed leg steps out. It’s RACHEL in a
glittering gown. Her hair is swept up, her jewelry
catches the light, she’s a VISION.
It’s an EXPLOSION OF FLASHES as photographers, reporters,

This gets Astrid’s attention.
ASTRID
That’s Cassian’s birthday.
MICHAEL
Yeah, I know. I hate to miss it,
but this is important.

MICHAEL
Oh, Jesus, Astrid.
ASTRID
Let’s just get through the wedding
and we’ll deal with it after. I
don’t want to make a scene.
Michael looks at her, incredulous.
MICHAEL
You find out I’m having an affair
with another woman, and you’re
worried about making a scene?
ASTRID
You’d rather I scream and carry
on?
MICHAEL
Yes. Honestly, I wish you would.
It would show you cared about more
than what people thought of you
and your family -ASTRID
Don’t try and turn this on me.
I’m not the one who screwed up!
MICHAEL
Of course not. You’re always the
prettiest, richest, most perfect
girl in the room. While I’m just

How can you say that?
As the driver pulls over, Astrid reacts, thrown.
Michael gets out of the car. Just like that, he’s gone.
Shell-shocked, Astrid starts to break down... then
quickly pulls herself together.
INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - DAY
The interior of the church has been transformed into an
ARTFUL ABSTRACT FOREST.
Eleanor, Jacqueline, Alix, and Felicity hold court with
other SOCIETY WIVES by the front pews. Eleanor looks at

ELEANOR
Is this a church or a paddy field?

They turn to see PRINCESS INTAN, 40s, a lofty Southeast

What's all this

Ah Ma turns to Rachel.
AH MA
(in Mandarin;
subtitled)
Rachel... suiran wo renshi ni de
rizi bu chang, ke wo kan de

[Rachel. I’ve only known you a
short time, but it’s clear you’re
a very smart woman.]
Nick smiles at Ah Ma’s seeming endorsement of Rachel.
AH MA
(in Mandarin;
subtitled)
Ke wo buneng rang ni hui le wo de
sunzi gen wo de jia. [But, I will
not permit you to ruin my grandson
with your ambition.]
Rachel is stunned.

Nick, reacts, shocked.
NICK

Ah Ma!
ELEANOR
I’m sorry to tell you, but Rachel
has been lying to us about her
family and her mother...

RACHEL
(guard up)
What, uh... What are you talking
about?
ELEANOR
I hired a private investigator to
look into her past -NICK
Mum, you didn’t -ELEANOR
She said her father passed away in
China, but that’s not true.
(to Rachel)
Your mother’s husband is very much
alive. During her marriage she
cheated on him and became pregnant
with another man’s child, and
before he found out she ran away
to America.
Rachel is gutted, doesn’t know what to think.
Eleanor opens a DOSSIER on the table. Chinese news
articles and police missing person reports featuring
Kerry’s picture.
ELEANOR
It’s all in here.
NICK
You had no right -ELEANOR
We had every right.
RACHEL
Stop -- You’re lying.
NICK
You did not!
ELEANOR
Do you have any idea the scandal
this would have caused? For Rachel
to hide something like this -NICK
She wouldn’t have.
Eleanor sees Rachel is clearly shocked.

(CONTINUED)

ELEANOR
We cannot be linked to this sort
of family.
Rachel looks at Eleanor, backs away, reeling.
RACHEL
I don’t want any part of your
family.
He reaches for her, but Rachel pulls away, stung.
NICK
Rachel -Rachel takes off, Nick starts after her, when:
AH MA
(in Mandarin;
subtitled)
Buxu zhui ta. Zaojin ni ziji.
Buxu dong. Ni yao gen ta zou, jiu
bie huilai! [Don’t chase after
her and degrade yourself. I
forbid it. If you go with her,
you can’t come back!]
Let me go!

NICK
Rachel.

Nick pulls away and runs after Rachel.
ELEANOR
Ah Ma!

Nick!

AH MA
(in Mandarin;
subtitled; turns on
Eleanor)
Dou shi wei le ni, dou shi ni ya

Ni kan jintian! [This is your
fault. You let this happen by
allowing him to stay away so long.
Now, look!]
Eleanor stands there, submissive. Ah Ma reacts, stunned,
furious. OFF Eleanor, her worst fears coming true...

FEMALE WEDDING GUEST #2

She hears a SCREAM and turns to see several guests
POINTING and LAUGHING at:
A HALF-NAKED Bernard and Kitty behind some bushes.
Bernard is completely drunk and paws at Kitty, who’s
mortified at being discovered.
The crowd LAUGHS, derisive, as Kitty struggles to pull
her dress up as she flees.
It’s sickening to Rachel -- it feels like people are
talking about her as much as Kitty. She flees...
Among the crowd, we FIND Nick searching for Rachel, but
he’s too late...
NICK

Oh, Nicki have you...?

Oh, Amanda. Yes. Thank you,
Amanda. Thank you, Amanda. No,

It's good to see you.
For old times' sake.

Let's talk.

Nick frantically looks around the party for Rachel.
LAPSE as the crowd clears and it starts to rain.

TIME

EXT. GOH HOUSE - NIGHT
A PAIR OF BARE FEET walks up to the gate.
RACHEL, her once-flawless hair, makeup, and dress are a
mess. She carries her HIGH HEELS IN HER HANDS. Peik Lin
rushes to Rachel, who bursts into tears and collapses
into her friend.
INT. GOH HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY
Rachel lies on the upholstered bench at the end of the
bed, unmoving, staring into space. Sparse sunlight
filters into the room. Peik Lin enters.
PEIK LIN
Rachel? Come to breakfast. You
need to eat. Or, use the
bathroom, or maybe a shower. It's
there if you need it.
But Rachel doesn’t move.
TIME LAPSE SEQUENCE
-- It’s NIGHT: Rachel still lies in bed, awake, but not
moving. The door opens. It’s Neenah and Wye Mun with a
dinner tray. They have the twin girls bring the tray to
Rachel.
WYE MUN
(whispering)
Here, take this tray, okay. Take
this to Rachel. Okay, go to her.

GOH TWIN GIRL #1
Here, Rachel, this is your dinner.
RACHEL
Thank you.
The girls run back to Neenah and Wye Mun and they all
leave Rachel who’s just staring at the dinner tray.
-- Darkness gives way to dawn, but Rachel is still in
bed, unmoving. On the bedside table, her PHONE RINGS.
It’s NICK, Rachel presses ignore and places the phone
face-down on the table. Nick leaves a message -NICK (V.O.)
(pre-lap)
I’ll stop by again tonight.
INT. RAFFLES HOTEL - SUITE - DAY
Nick is on the phone, leaving Rachel a message.
NICK
(then)
Rachel, please, just give me a
call. Anytime. Please.
Nick hangs up.
INT. GOH FAMILY HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY
Peik Lin enters the dark room.
PEIK LIN
Rachel, someone’s here to see ya.
Rachel doesn’t move.
RACHEL
I don’t want to see him.
PEIK LIN
It’s not Nick.
Someone steps in from behind Peik Lin.
Rachel stirs, can’t believe her eyes.

It’s KERRY.

RACHEL
Mom!

Rachel rushes to her mom, hugging her. Rachel tears up,
finally with the person she needed the most.
TIME CUT TO:
INT. GOH FAMILY HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY
The blinds are open and Rachel sits up, looking better,
as Kerry fusses over her, bringing her herbal soup.
KERRY
Drink more. The dong-quai and the
ginseng will give you more energy.
RACHEL
Thanks.
Rachel lets herself be mothered, but Kerry sees the toll
the last few days have taken.
KERRY
Your spirit has always been so
strong, ever since young. You
will get through this.
Rachel nods, needing to hear that.

But:

RACHEL
Why didn’t you tell me about my
father?
Kerry nods, she’s been expecting this.
KERRY
My husband wasn’t a good man. He
hurt me.
(off Rachel)
But an old schoolmate of mine
helped me through things and we
fell in love and I got pregnant
with his baby, that’s you. I was
so afraid my husband would find
out and kill us both, so I just
took you and I ran to America.
Rachel is stunned.
RACHEL
Did you ever...? I don't know,
think about trying to talk to him?
I mean, do you think about him?

(CONTINUED)

125.
CONTINUED:

KERRY
Every day. When we first came to
America all I could think about
was reaching out for him, but I
was so afraid my husband would
find us. And now, I, I just don't
want to cause any trouble.
RACHEL
I’m really sorry.
Kerry shakes her head, smiles through the tears.
KERRY
Oh! Don’t be sorry. You listen
to me, everything that happened in
my past life is the reason why I
got you.
Rachel tears up, vulnerable.
KERRY
My brave and clever girl.
Rachel flops back on the bed.

Her mother lies down next

RACHEL
I really thought he was the one.
OFF Rachel as this sinks in.
RACHEL
Now, I just wanna go home.
KERRY
You know, Nick was the one who
called me and brought me out here.
Before we go, I think you should
go and talk to him.
Rachel sighs. Then they hear a clicking sound and turn
to see P.T. at the doorway holding his phone and taking
photos of them.
P.T.
I'll e-mail the photo later.
RACHEL
P.T., how long you been standing
there?
P.T.
Just a short while.

Rachel and Kerry laugh.
EXT. RIVERFRONT - DAY
Rachel sits on a bench, when she sees Nick approach,
tentative, hopeful. He sits next to her.
NICK
I’m so sorry about everything.
What my mother did to you is
unforgivable -RACHEL
It’s not your fault -NICK
It is. Ever since I can remember,
my family has been my whole life.
And I am done making excuses for
them.
He pulls out the ring he’s been carrying.

Marry me. Marry me and we’ll

York, just you and me. I’ll leave
all of this behind.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Eleanor, wearing sunglasses, walks by the row of old
terraced shophouses, pausing when she hears a familiar
CLACKING sound. She walks through an unmarked door,
into:
INT. MAHJONG HALL - DAY
Eleanor enters to see Rachel playing mahjong with two
WOMEN at a back table.
It’s a FLUID, RHYTHMIC RITUAL -- the staccato clacking of
tiles, stacks being formed and moved like clockwork.
Eleanor is surprised to see how adept and effortless
Rachel is. Eleanor walks up to the table.

127.
CONTINUED:

RACHEL
Thanks for meeting me here.
(re: women)
Don’t worry about them. They’re
half deaf and they only speak
Hokkien.
WOMAN
(hands Eleanor dice)
Mm-hmm.
Eleanor sits down at the table, and tosses the dice in
the middle of the stacks of tiles. She starts playing
the game.
RACHEL
My mom taught me how to play. She
told me mahjong would teach me
important life skills.
Negotiation, strategy,
cooperation.
(NOTE: The game goes on throughout the scene. With
cards thrown, picked up, chips exchanging hands, etc.)
ELEANOR
You asked me here. I assume it’s
not for a mahjong lesson. Pung.
She puts down a power card combo.

The women toss red

ELEANOR
My mother taught me, too.
Rachel tosses her a red chip.
RACHEL
I know Nick told you the truth
about my mom. But you didn’t like
me the second I got here. Why is
that?
ELEANOR
There’s a Hokkien phrase. Ka gi
lan. It means ‘our own kind of
people.’ And you’re not our own
kind.
RACHEL
‘Cause I’m not rich? ‘Cause I
didn’t go to a British boarding
school or I wasn't born into a
wealthy family?

ELEANOR
You’re a foreigner. American.
And all Americans think about is
their own happiness.
RACHEL
Don’t you want Nick to be happy?
ELEANOR
It’s an illusion. We understand
how to build things that last.
Something you know nothing about.
RACHEL
You don’t know me.
ELEANOR
I know you’re not what Nick needs.

Well, he proposed to me yesterday.

He said he’d walk away from his

The other women

RACHEL
Don’t worry, I turned him down.
Eleanor tries to regain her composure.
ELEANOR
Only a fool folds a winning hand.
RACHEL
There’s no winning. You made sure
of that. Because if Nick chose
me, he would lose his family. And
if he chose his family, he might
spend the rest of his life
resenting you.
Eleanor grabs a tile that Rachel had just discarded.
ELEANOR
(realizing)
So you chose for him.
RACHEL
I’m not leaving ‘cause I’m scared
or because I think I’m not enough.
Because... maybe for the first
time in my life, I know I am.

RACHEL (CONT'D)
(beat)
I just love Nick so much. I don't
want him to lose his mom again.
So I just wanted you to know that
one day, when he marries another
lucky girl, who is enough for you,
and you're playing with your
grandkids while the tan huas are
blooming, and the birds are
chirping, that it was because of
me... a poor, raised by a single
mother, low class, immigrant
nobody.

Rachel SHOWS HER HAND -- a WINNING COMBINATION -- but she
FOLDS. The game is mucked (no one can win). Rachel gets
up.
As Rachel reaches the door, REVEAL Kerry has been sitting
quietly at another table. As Kerry joins Rachel, she
turns to see Eleanor and the two mothers exchange a look.
INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
Astrid enters as Michael packs a bag. Michael is
uncomfortable, not wanting to do this in front of her.
MICHAEL
Hey. I'm gonna send someone for
the rest of my stuff. But I wanna
talk to you about my visitation
rights with Cassian.
ASTRID
Stop talking.
MICHAEL
What?
ASTRID
Don’t worry about packing your
things. You bought this

Michael takes her arm, holds her

MICHAEL
Hey! Look, you know, it's not
just my fault that things didn't
work out.
Astrid pauses, then:
ASTRID
You’re right. I shouldn’t have
kept things from you. Hidden my
shoes, turned down jobs, charity
work, worrying that it might make
you feel lesser than. But let’s
be clear -- the problem with our
marriage isn’t my family’s money.
It’s that you’re a coward. You
gave up on us. But I’ve just
realized -(then)
It’s not my job to make you feel
like a man. I can’t make you
something you’re not.

Peik Lin helps Rachel load SUITCASES into a waiting TAXI.
PEIK LIN
