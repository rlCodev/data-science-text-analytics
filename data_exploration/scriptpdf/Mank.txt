MANK
An Original Screenplay by
Jack Fincher

PROLOGUE:
In 1940, at the tender age of 24, Orson Welles was lured to
Hollywood by a struggling RKO Pictures with a contract
befitting his formidable storytelling talents. He was given
absolute creative autonomy, would suffer no oversight, and
could make any movie, about any subject, with any
collaborator he wished...

FADE IN:

EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - DAY

From a lanyard, hangs a rustic sign reading NORTH VERDE
RANCH. The only sound is a distant WHINE, the only movement
a boil of dust on the horizon. As the WHINE rises to a
ROAR, the boil of dust grows until it becomes a car that
flashes past the sign and sets the lanyard swinging. No
sooner does it settle back down than a second car,
following the first, slams by and starts it waggling again.

EXT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY

The cars stop in front of a small sun-bleached house.
SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:
EXT. VICTORVILLE - GUEST RANCH - DAY - 1940
The occupants of both cars get out. The driver of the first
is JOHN HOUSEMAN, a swart, officious young man already
verging on middle age. His passenger is RITA ALEXANDER, a
crisp young woman with an air of quiet competence. She
falls in step behind him as they walk to the bungalow. The
driver of the second car, a CHAUFFEUR, joins a NURSE in
carefully removing from its back seat a FIGURE whose bottom
half is encased in a huge plaster cast. Taking his arms on
either side they slowly help him to the waiting bungalow.
The cast figure reassuring them and himself...
FIGURE IN CAST
It’s all right. I- I've got this.
I'm - I'm good.
He doesn't. He isn't.

Efficient, HOUSEMAN fusses, feeling for dust. RITA opens
windows and turns on a fan. The door slams open, the NURSE
and CHAUFFEUR staggering through the frame with the FIGURE
IN THE CAST, putting him to bed.
ANGLE FAVORING HOUSEMAN
Approaching the FIGURE in bed. The NURSE plumps his pillow.
HOUSEMAN

Here.
(wiping dust off hands)
Well, I've had them set you up out
here, so you wouldn't feel quite
so confined. The ladies will
scandalize the neighborhood by
occupying both bedrooms.
There is no response. He's adjusting to his new environs.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
I will be staying in town at a
bucolic spa called, if you can
believe it, The Shoulder Arms. I
will do my editing there.
Still nothing from the Figure in the Cast.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Now as you know, Fraulein Freda is
not only a nurse and physical
therapist, she studied nutrition
back in the old country. Ja,
liebes fraulein?
FRAULEIN FREDA
(speaking German)
Jawohl, Herr Houseman.
HOUSEMAN
It's a dry house, the owner of the
ranch doesn't permit alcohol. But
you're from Pennsylvania, you're
no doubt used to it...

3.
The figure in the cast struggles to get out of bed. The
ladies scramble to stop him; it's futile. The CHAUFFEUR
enters, lugging a small, heavy cabinet.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Saved by the proverbial bell.
(to Chauffeur)
Set it here, please? Careful,
careful...
The CHAUFFEUR does, putting the heavy cabinet down...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)

Thank you.

He sets it, then leaves. Houseman crosses to it...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)

Observe...

HOUSEMAN presses a button, and a hidden door springs open,
revealing a dazzling array of miniature liquor bottles
aligned in a row.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Well, naturally you'll do your
damndest to get at it. By the time
you finish the first draft, which
is to say ninety days, you should
be a world-class sprinter.
Houseman snaps shut the cabinet.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Rita? Come in here, will you?
RITA approaches the bed, her manner professional.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
This is Mrs. Alexander. She types
a hundred perfect words a minute
and takes dictation like a
clairvoyant. Rita Alexander Herman Mankiewicz.
RITA
(clipped British accent)
How do you do, Mister Mankiewicz.

4.
MANK
That's a big question.
CLOSE UP OF MANK - OUR FIRST LOOK
The wrecked face of a 43-year-old alcoholic, a bloat of
chalky flesh pocked by two eyes - like puckering wounds.
But his gaze has an intelligent, devilish glint, he may be
drunk...
HOUSEMAN
Well, since you like working
nights -- Rita here runs on London
time. Her husband is one of our
bold lads in the RAF. Flies -what is it, Rita? Spitfires?
RITA
Hurricanes.
MANK
My sympathy and prayers.
RITA
I beg your pardon?
MANK
Given the speed, climb, and
turning radius of the
Messerschmitt Bf 109...
RITA
I hope we won't need your
sympathy, Mister Mankiewicz. We'll
do the praying. And the fighting.
HOUSEMAN
I will meet with Orson weekly.
Keep him to date on our progress.
We're expecting great things. What
is it a writer says? "Tell the
story you know?"
When the phone RINGS. RITA answers...
MANK
I don't know that writer.

5.
RITA
Hello. Yes...yes he's right
here...
HOUSEMAN
Well, you should have everything.
If I've forgotten, there's a
clipboard.
She hands it to Houseman.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
(to Welles)
Yes? Hello?
RITA
They're getting him...
HOUSEMAN
Our wunderkind does have the gift
of theatrical timing...
As he waits, they all do...

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY
HOUSEMAN
Orson, hello. We just got in. Oh?
He listens, GRUNTS, then passes the phone over to MANK.
ANGLE ON MANK
Hello?

MANK

WELLES (V.O.)
(that voice)
Mank! Houseman tells me we have
you just where we want you.
Lucky me.

MANK

WELLES (V.O.)
How's the leg?
MANK
Thigh bone's connected to the hip
bone.

6.
WELLES (V.O.)
Excellent. Ready and willing to
hunt the Great White Whale?
MANK
Just call me Ahab. I understand
we've 90 days.
WELLES (V.O.)
Let's aim for sixty.
Mank cups the phone.
MANK
He's just cut a month.
(on phone)
I used to do it in five for you at
The Mercury. This is leisurely.
WELLES (V.O.)
Sixty days and then we can noodle.
MANK
Nothing like a good noodle. Is the
reason you lopped 30 days to run
it past RKO legal?
Welles laughs his contagious baritone laugh.
WELLES (V.O.)
I thought I told you, Mank. I have
final cut, final everything. There
are no studio notes. We'll have no
one but ourselves to blame.
MANK
Sixty days and a noodle.
WELLES (V.O.)
Gotta run...I'm doing tests for
"Heart of Darkness."
MANK
Oh, little that, lesser Joe
Conrad.
WELLES (V.O.)
If anyone should ask, tell 'em
you're adapting.

7.
MANK
Oh, you don't know this sunbleached sewer yet, my friend.
Break wind at Hollywood and Vine
and a producer in Santa Monica
reports a ruptured main.
WELLES (V.O.)
No, I don't know this Burgh, not
yet. I'm toiling with you in
spirit, Mank. And I don't hear any
typing.
He hangs up. Mank gives Houseman the phone back.
MANK
No notes. And then he turned 24.
Mank lays back.
Trapped.

SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:
INT. MANKIEWICZ HOME - NIGHT - WEEKS EARLIER
A door BANGS open. Light spills in, illuminating a bedroom.
MANK and his wife SARA are silhouetted in the doorway, his
arm over her shoulder, she drags him to the bed.
MANK
(grunts)
Uh-uh.
SARA
Let me take off these clothes.
She starts doing that.
MANK
They let me go just as I'd
achieved perfect equilibrium.

8.
MANK (CONT'D)
I won't work with half the
producers on the lot and the other
half won't work with me.
SARA
What's this? A racing form?
MANK
Hmm, you stop reading, you stop
learning.
SARA
Hold still. Lie back...
MANK
Hmm... cigarette please.
SARA
Hermie, if a match gets anywhere
near your breath -- you'll burst
into flames.
MANK
Even the dog's name is awful.
Sounds like a Japanese houseboy.
You mark my words, Sara, The
Wizard of Oz is gonna sink that
studio.
SARA
Sleep. You're driving to New York
tomorrow.
MANK
(melancholy)
Remember when you used to take the
train from back east? I'd sneak
aboard in Albuquerque and climb
into your compartment naked.
SARA
I also remember how I spent my
honeymoon in Berlin, with hookers
running up and down the stairs all
night...
He laughs.

9.
SARA (CONT'D)
...because my dashing
correspondent couldn't afford a
nice hotel...
MANK
Weren't those the days?
SARA
(an old refrain)
Yeah, yeah, 'and the nights
weren't bad either.'
Schnutz?

MANK

SARA
For the last time, what?
MANK
What year is it?
Herman...

SARA

MANK
I should have done something by
now.
Hermie...

SARA

MANK
Give me a sign, oh Lord, I am as
your servant Moses -- though I
won't work half as cheap.
SARA
(kissing him)
Go to sleep, Meshuggener.
She crosses to open the door. She turns off the light...
Schnutz?

MANK

SARA
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!???
MANK
Why do you put up with me?

10.
She looks at his figure in the dark.
SARA
(honestly)
I don't know.
She starts to close the door...
MANK
(out of the dark)
That bush in the front yard. If it
catches fire tonight - you will let
me know?

EXT. MOJAVE DESERT (1939) - NEXT DAY
A speeding convertible. MANK is a passenger in the front
seat. A young man named TOMMY is driving. He is agitated,
gesturing...
TOMMY
..I mean, you know all kinds of
things -- iambic pentameter, the
words of the great poets...What
about the way she signed it,
"Always, Ethel." Can you beat
that? Not just, Ethel. "Always,
Ethel."
MANK
Tommy, if we can find civilization
by sundown, I hope to climb out of
this crate and into a cold
martini.
TOMMY
She's not the kind to use 'always'
if she didn't mean it. If she
meant just 'Ethel' she'd write
just 'Ethel', not 'always.'
Wouldn't you think?
MANK
The road, Tommy.
TOMMY
I know - you read it... see what I
mean.

11.
As TOMMY takes the letter from his pocket, the wind
snatches it and rips it down the side of the car. Lunging
to grab it, TOMMY loses control of the wheel.
7

EXT. CRASH SCENE - NIGHT

A play of headlights catches AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS laboring
to free MANK. TOMMY stands over them, woozy but unhurt.
TOMMY (V.O)
She loves me, don't you think?

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

CLOSE-UP OF MANK
Buried in hospital sheets, his head swathed in bandages.
Distantly he hears the SOUND of FOOTFALLS. Turning his head
groggily, he peers down the corridor.
MANK'S POV
From a narcotic haze he sees - A SPECTER in black opera
cloak and shepherd's hat. As it reaches MANK it vanishes
(seating itself), then reappears as a disembodied face -large, distorted, floating, moonlike.
WELLES
Mank? It's Orson Welles.
MANK
(etherized)
Of course it is.
WELLES
I think it's time we talked.
MANK
I'm all ears.

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW (1940) - NIGHT

We see the result of some days (nights) work...a small stack
of notepads. And Mank is propped up in bed in his pajamas,
squinting into the darkness as he talks. RITA sits
scribbling on a pad.

12.
MANK
(dictating)
Once a castle on a hill, now a
memory of what once was... alone
in his unfinished, already
decaying pleasure palace... aloof,
seldom visited, never
photographed...
(thinking)
We see an OLD MAN in a robe,
smoking a pipe, sitting alone by
his pool, discarded pages
scattered at his feet. Narrator:
"...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing
empire...vainly attempting to
sway, as he once did, the
destinies of a nation which had
long since ceased to listen to him
- No. H-had ceased to trust him. "
(beat)
We see through the trees as an
AIDE pushes this OLD MAN in a
wheelchair across neatly groomed
lawns...
Mank thinks, taking up a swatter, he takes casual aim at a
housefly.
MANK (CONT'D)
Narrator: "There, last month - as
it must to all men, death came to"
(SWAT! The fly is swot)
Let's have that cuppa, Mrs. A.
Rita gets up to get their tea.
RITA
Oh...I know who it is, or who it's
meant to be...
MANK
What makes you think it's meant to
be anybody.

13.
RITA
Oh come now. Everyone in the
English-speaking world will
recognize him instantly.
(returning with cups)
MANK
Exactly what he would say.
RITA
(serving)
Did you know the man?
MANK
Maybe -- I used to.
RITA
You wrote for one of his papers?
MANK
(ladling sugar)
Oh, no. Praise God. I met him
after he started bankrolling his
girlfriend's pictures.
RITA
(sipping hers straight)
You knew Marion Davies?
MANK
(shrugs)
If anyone did.
RITA
Really? What's she like?
MANK
Why is it when you scratch a prim,
starchy English schoolgirl, you
get a swooning moving-picture fan
who has forgotten all she ever
learned about the Battle of
Hastings?
RITA
(smiling)
Hastings: Fourteen, October, Tensixty-six. 10 centigrade...

Beneath a stall LEDERER sees two hairy legs sticking out
from a glorious pair of plaid boxer shorts at half mast.
Mank?

LEDERER

JOE MANKIEWICZ explodes out, jacking up his trousers. His
florid looks might be MANK'S in better days. He charges the
sink, washing his hands.
LEDERER (CONT'D)
Sorry. Somebody told me Mankiewicz
was in here.
JOE
He is... I'm the "promising"
brother, Joe.
LEDERER
I didn't know Herman had a
brother.
JOE
Neither does anyone else.
(drying his hands)
Let me guess.

15.
JOE (CONT'D)
"There are millions to be made and
your only competition is idiots,

LEDERER
How did you know?
JOE
I hate to tell you, anyone who can

MOVING WITH THEM down a hallway, up some stairs -- past a
pool of typing women that never avert their eyes... They
enter a door marked "GENIUS AT PLAY - KEEP OUT."
JOE (CONT'D)
It's after lunch, and we're on a
deadline - he may be busy...
LEDERER
Oh. I promise I won't be a bother.
JOE
Not exactly what I meant...
12

INT. WRITERS ROOM - DAY

12

A fool’s paradise. Dominated by a conference table covered
with the lavish remains of a catered lunch and a disrupted
poker game. The WRITERS are NOISILY clustered around
something we cannot see. JOE points at LEDERER, then sits
down and picks up where he left off dictating to, this is
true, a NUDE SECRETARY.
REVERSE ANGLE ON
The WRITERS are watching MANK flip a coin with comedian
EDDIE CANTOR. Among them, standing out of the way is
cinematographer SHELLY METCALF.
MANK
Come on! You know I'm goodferitt.
MANK nods grimly. CANTOR tosses it high in the air...And we
see young CHARLIE LEDERER has eased among them...
Fellas --

LEDERER

16.
HECHT
Shhhhh -- these are high stakes...
CANTOR
Go on (catching coin, after a
beat, showing him...)
- Ooh! Tails! That's six!
MANK
Goddammit. Alright, double or
nothing. And this time, you banjoeyed sonofabitch, let it hit the
floor.
JOE
Banjo Eyes.
HECHT
(aside to LEDERER)
Mank once bet me a five spot to
see how long it would take a
falling leaf to hit the ground.
Had to go to management to cover
it.
LEDERER
For five bucks?
HECHT
(like he's from Mars)
Five thousand.
MANK
Come on, come on. Heads, you
bastard!
Cantor tosses the coin. As the coin strikes the floor -the writers GROAN. MANK has lost again. CANTOR CLAPS,
CHORTLES, and skips out the door like a child. All the
SPECTATORS but LEDERER drift back to their poker game,
GRUMBLING. MANK notices him for the first time.
CANTOR
Oooh! Pleasure doing business with
you, gentlemen.

17.
MANK
Hey Charlie! Yeah, you all
remember the Algonquin cabin boy,
Charlie Lederer -- a poor but
somewhat talented magazine writer
come west to join our merry band.
(to Charlie)
Well... you know almost everyone.
LEDERER
(with the greatest
respect for each)
Mr. Kaufman...
KAUFMAN
George is fine, kid...
LEDERER
Mr. Perelman.
PERELMAN
Nice to meet you, son...
LEDERER
Do you prefer Sidney or S.J.?
MANK
Uh, he takes what he gets. Uh, the
great Charles MacArthur...
MacArthur waves.
LEDERER
Good to see you again, Mr.
MacArthur.
MANK
(motions at Shelly)
My resident jack of all trades...
Shelly Metcalf.
Hey, kid.

SHELLY

LEDERER
Mr. Metcalf.

MANK
Oh, save the Mister for the

JOE
...Have Cyclone say, "I don't mind
the heat as much as I do the
humanity."
MANK
And the one and only, Ben Hecht.
Hecht laughs.
HECHT
(to Charlie)
Have you been laid yet?
PERELMAN (O.S.)
Do you have to think about that?
The phone RINGS. Kaufman answers it:
KAUFMAN
Hello, yeah, right away...
Kaufman checks watch, hangs up.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
Selznick, everyone. Five minutes.
They all jump up.
MANK
Well you've arrived in the wellknown nick, Charlie. Just in time
for a story conference with the
great David O.
A general SCRAPING of chairs as the poker game breaks up.
PERELMAN
Once more unto the breach KAUFMAN
Breach hell, unto the wire MACARTHUR

Cue?

JOE

INT. SELZNICK'S OFFICE

13

The WRITERS file in and take seats, helping themselves one
after another to cigars from an elegant humidor. They
engage in the ritual of clipping, lighting and savoring a
fine Havana. SELZNICK is a large, ungainly man with a
flashing smile. Beside him stands a whippet-thin man with
wavy hair, polished military boots, and riding crop.
SELZNICK
Boys, come in. Ah, make yourselves
at home. Now, you all know Joe Von
Sternberg.
MANK
(pointing to HECHT,
mouths)
He loved The Blue Angel.
Von Sternberg grunts.
SELZNICK
You wanted 72 hours, you got 72
hours, tell us what you have so
far. Ben, whyn'tcha start.
HECHT removes his cigar, speaks, then puts it back - a
signal for the next man to remove his cigar and take up the
narrative. The effect is not unlike an invisible medicine
ball being tossed -- as all improvise with utmost gravity.

20.
HECHT
Well, this was tough - David, in
the beginning we couldn't agree on
an approach...
SELZNICK
Really; and why was that?
HECHT
Well, we see - a different kind of
Paramount picture.
SELZNICK
Different how?
MACARTHUR
Frankenstein and The Wolfman, all
rolled into one, only -SELZNICK
(stopping them)
I don't make cheap horror
pictures, Universal does...
MANK
This is different. This is about
something.
Selznick's skepticism fairly drips off of him.
Okay...
Sidney...

SELZNICK
MANK

PERELMAN
Imagine a mad scientist touring
the boonies, with a mechanical
freak he's..."fabricated."
SELZNICK
What does he mean, "fabricated?"
MANK
...and displays it to
superstitious hayseeds in a giant
silk-lined casket, for the price
of admission.

21.
Selznick grunts.
KAUFMAN
...but every full moon, the
monster awakens and raises unholy
hell with the villagers.
MACARTHUR
Give it an Eastern European look,
men in leather shorts, gals in
tattered peasant blouses.
SELZNICK
Let me guess, they think it's the
devil?
VON STERNBERG
Villagers always think it's the
devil.
MACARTHUR
(undeterred)
And the scientist and his creation
are forced to flee during a raging
electrical storm PERELMAN
- flee from outraged peasants KAUFMAN
- who pursue them mit torches PERELMAN
- overturn their creaky wagon MANK
- and set fire to it.
A pregnant lull. MANK points his stogie at LEDERER.
MANK (CONT'D)
Tell him about the finale,
Charlie.
LEDERER
(swallowing hard)
Oh, well...

22.
LEDERER (CONT'D)
the rain turns to sleet, puts out
the fire, and entombs the monster
in solid ice...While nearby, an
old priest weeps.
Selznick ever so slightly softens.
SELZNICK
Hmm! A weeping priest?
MANK
(puffing grandly)
Thunder, lightning, blood, fire,
religion...
SELZNICK
All in one film?
MANK
...and...with an unseasonal
thaw... a sequel.
SELZNICK
I thought you said this was about
something, this was different.
They all turn to the sage, Ben Hecht.
HECHT
Plus, the ominous futility of man
playing God KAUFMAN
- the Faustian bargain of life
everlasting PERELMAN
- and the triumph of the human
spirit over the beast incarnate in
our far too solid flesh.
MANK
(flourishing cigar)
It’s director-proof.
VON STERNBERG bristles.

Joe?

SELZNICK
(to VON STERNBERG)

23.

B picture.

VON STERNBERG

SELZNICK
It's not for Joe...
(shaking his head)
Boys, this is serious, we need
your help. We've got to get people
into theatres, but how?
A cathedral QUIET. Then:
MANK
Show movies in the streets?

You obviously don't know my aunt.
If you're not doing anything, come

Oh. You mean "Poor Sara."

No, she and the kids are back
east.

EXT. GLENDALE STATION, LOS ANGELES - END OF DAY

15

LEDERER, carrying an overnight bag, paces the sidewalk,
shooting glances at his wristwatch. Suddenly an UPROAR.
HIS POV
A gleaming white convertible glides into view, a COP
clearing it's way. Matinee idol JOHN GILBERT is at the
wheel. His paramour GRETA GARBO lounges beside him
bestowing smiles on FANS who jog in their wake. MANK is
draped over the seat back, splendidly drunk, throwing
kisses to the uncaring multitude.
The Rolls inches to a stop and is surrounded by an ARMY of
ADMIRERS. GILBERT and GARBO sign autographs as MANK half
climbs, half falls to his feet. He carries not so much as a
shaving kit. Wordlessly he kisses GARBO'S cheek. GARBO
LAUGHS famously. GILBERT REVS, ROARS off.
LEDERER leads a weaving MANK toward their coach.
LEDERER
Herman... Herman.
And with that, like an exclamation point, he literally
passes out onto a luggage cart. The Porter doesn't miss a
beat, wheeling him to his train.
Charlie!

MANK saunters into a world of gilt diptychs, Oriental

EXT. GROUNDS

18

Tents dot the endless lawn. Servants ply the chosen. And
absurdly there is a huge stack of firewood resembling a
Viking funeral pyre, where a screaming woman threatened by
"Injuns," is enticingly tied atop, being filmed.
TWO MEN IN RIDING TOGS are sitting over refreshments under
a tent. The younger man is IRVING THALBERG, M.G.M.
production chief, who has the dark, fine-boned features of
a coiled and restless Valentino. Next to him is studio
head, LOUIS B. MAYER, a stumpy, otter-sleek ogre in silver
spectacles.
THALBERG
(seeing)
What is Mank doing here?
Who?

MAYER

THALBERG
Herman Mankiewicz.
MAYER
Do I know him?
THALBERG
He wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
Ahhhhh...
Mank!

MAYER
THALBERG

MANK
Thalberg! The boy genius...
THALBERG
I am shocked to see you here.

26.
MANK
(smiles)
I'd be shocked to see me here too,
Irving...if only I knew where here
was...
MAYER
You wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
MANK
Among many.
Pictures?
Writers.

MAYER
MANK

THALBERG
At M-G-M, movies are a team sport,
Mank.
MANK
Which may be why I'm at Paramount.
MAYER
Since when don't Paramount use
writers by the truckload?
MANK
But all at once, not in relays.
Helps spread the blame around.
THALBERG
You remember our chairman, Louis
B. Mayer?
MANK
By reputation only...
MAYER
Long night?
MANK
A short one. Plagued by "spirits."
Hell of a way to spend the
sabbath, fellas.
MAYER
Here in support of a friend.

27.
THALBERG
His leading lady is making a midcareer adjustment.
Mank sees SHELLY METCALF, the thin - erudite cameraman, is
loading film.
MANK
Oh, I'm on my way over. Any notes
from the oversight tent?
As he walks away...
MAYER
Who was that again?
THALBERG
Just a writer.
TRAVEL WITH MANK
As he strolls by all the machinations of movie-making,
including MAKEUP ARTISTS putting warpaint on the faces of
CAUCASIAN ACTORS playing Native Americans...the elaborate
equipment of a real movie, with the MGM trademark...He
approaches Shelly.
MANK
Slumming on Saturday, Mr. Metcalf?
SHELLY
(glad to see him)
Mank! No sir, helping out on B
Camera -- it's a home movie -- but
HIS idea of a home movie.
MARION (V.O.)
I know you.
Mank looks up and sees MAKEUP and HAIR PEOPLE clearing from
the BLONDE ACTRESS on the top of the FUNERAL PYRE, MARION
DAVIES.
MANK
Well, what's at stake here?
MARION
We met at John Gilbert's birthday.
You're Herman Mankiewicz.

28.
MANK
Guilty. And I remember you - Miss
Davies. Regaling us with stories
about dodging trolley cars in
Brooklyn...
She laughs...
MANK (CONT'D)
Your Flatbush was showing.
She laughs even louder.
MARION
Oh! You fractured Wally Beery's
wrist Indian wrestling.
MANK
Admittedly, a lucky break.
MARION
Boy - was he surprised. You're
stronger than you look.
MANK
And from what I understand, you're
smarter.
She squints.
MARION
That was a compliment.
They smile at each other.
MANK
See what I mean?
MARION
You are interesting.
(whispers)
I need a favor but you're gonna
have to promise you won't laugh.
MANK
Given the state of the world, a
tall order.
MARION
You're gunna, I just know you are.

29.
MANK
I have got such a hangover right
now, there's just a fighting
chance I won't.
MARION
(whispers)
I'm being burned at the stake and
I am dying for a ciggie-boo.
MANK LAUGHS, then winces.
MARION (CONT'D)
Ha! There - God's punishing you.
Watch those stairs, they're
treacherous.
MANK
(walking up)
Every moment of my life is
treacherous.
MARION grabs a cigarette out of his pack.
MANK (CONT'D)
Any last words?
MARION
'Welcome to San Simeon.'
She puts it between her lips, Mank lights it. MARION takes
a deep draw, motions him to take it away.
MANK
(mouthful)
I've written worse.
MARION
You've never seen it?
MANK
No, but George Bernard Shaw was
right...
MARION
How's that?
MANK
"It's what God might've built had
he had the money..."

30.
MARION
Well, as they say in the Bronx,
"make yourself to home," Mister
Mankiewicz. Or shall I call you
Herman?
MANK
No, please, call me Mank.
LEDERER APPEARS.
MARION
Good morning, Charles.
Charlie.

MANK

LEDERER
Aunt Marion... Mank.
MANK'S eyebrows REGISTER their relationship.
MARION
Sleep well?
LEDERER
Until your rather dramatic "wakeup" call.
MARION
This is all Pop's idea. He wants
me ready "to take on the talkies."
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
First positions, please!
Everybody scatters. Mank and Lederer start to clear. Marion
assumes her subservient position. The Native Americans
ready to do their worst.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Riders ready! Rolling!
Speed!
Action!

CAMERAMAN (V.O.)
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

We see FOUR RIDERS in buckskins, guns a-blazing, riding to
save Marion.

31.
Ahead of the riders, a CAMERA CAR films the riders. In the
camera car is the DIRECTOR along with a MAN in his sixties
of some substance, with a stillness, a confidence, a kind
of elegance about him. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST.
MARION
Help! Please! Someone save me!
Once the Riders arrive at the pyre to save the day:
Cut!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

MARION
(calls)
Pops, this is Herman Mankiewicz
but we're to call him Mank.
HEARST
(from the car)
Mankiewicz? Herman Mankiewicz? New
York playwright and drama critic?
Mank approaching the car...
MANK
(bowing)
Turned humble screenwriter. Mr.
Hearst.
HEARST
Why, no need to be humble Mister
Mankiewicz, pictures that talk are
the future. They're gonna need
people who honor words to give
them voice. There's a golden age
coming when all the world will be
a stage - and you, perhaps their
Shakespeare.
MANK
Oh, I wouldn't have thought you'd
be that keenly interested in the
honoring of words.
Mank smiles. Marion laughs at the thought, a look and a
sound that seldom greets HEARST'S ideas face to face.
HEARST
What's so funny?

32.
MANK
I'm just surprised, that a vaunted
muckraker like yourself sees
Hollywood's future as such a shiny
penny.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(to the Driver)
Back to one...
The DRIVER, accommodating Mank and Hearst's conversation,
starts very slowly rolling the car towards its initial
position...Mank walking alongside, keeping pace with the
car...
HEARST
Times are changing, Mr.
Mankiewicz, and I'm not just
referring to this Depression.
MANK
Oh, that bother.
HEARST
When all this is over, picture
makers are gonna have to service
this new entertainment. I intend
to make pictures with the help of
real literary minds.
MANK
I support that.
HEARST
Instead, what do most studios give
us? Gangster flicks! Zanies!
Too true.

MANK

HEARST
Now, how many gangsters do
Americans meet in a lifetime? How
many families are like the Marx
Brothers?
MANK
You mean besides my own?

33.
HEARST
Ha! Very good.
(to AD)
Hearst whispers to the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. As the camera
car with the crane carrying William Randolph Hearst drives
to its first position...
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(through megaphone)
Miss Davies, Mr. Hearst would like
Mr. Mankiewicz seated to his left
at dinner.
MARION
(sharp inhale to Mank)
Oh. Pops likes you.
DISSOLVE TO:
19

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW (1940) - MANK'S BED - NIGHT

19

FRAULEIN FREDA enters, a liniment bottle in one hand, a
letter in the other. The letter she hands to RITA, the
liniment she begins slapping on MANK'S arms. He is lying on
his back, editing pages which RITA proofreads.
MANK
Why is it, when Houseman edits
everyone ends up speaking like a
constipated Oxford don?
As RITA opens the letter, the phone RINGS. She answers.
RITA
Hello?...Yes he is, no, not at
all... please hold on.
(to MANK)
It's "Poor Sar-," I'm sorry -it's your wife.
She hands MANK the phone.
Schnutz.

MANK

34.
SARA (V.O.)
I heard that... Hermie, Joe called
four times in the last three days.
He wants your number out there.
MANK
So give it to him.
SARA (V.O.)
(some disturbance)
Knock it off!
(to Mank)
The boys are remodeling.
He seemed concerned about
something. Is everything okay?
MANK
If I could swim, I'd be doing
swimmingly. And don't mind Joe,
he's a worrisome old woman in
disguise.
SARA (V.O.)
Well, he wants to offer you work.
MANK
Baby Joe offering me? Well, if he
calls again give him this number,
Schnutz. I - I've got to run. Kiss
the offspring.
MANK hangs up. FRAULEIN FREDA continues to knead his
shoulders. MANK sees that RITA is reading her letter.
MANK (CONT'D)
(in a British accent)
I say, a letter from the gallant
leftenant?
(reverting to American)
Let us hope it makes more sense
than the last. Fighters off the
decks of aircraft carriers.
Whoever had that idea...
FRAULEIN FREDA
Is not good?

35.
MANK
Not good? German U-boats are
starting to hunt in packs and a
Stuka dive bomber can drop one
down your stack from five hundred
feet.
(to Rita)
What's our valiant laddie have to
say for the cause?
RITA is still reading silently. Now, she wads the letter
up, dropping it, and rising, leaves. MANK motions FRAULEIN
FREDA to hand it to him.
FRAULEIN FREDA
It's not from her husband...His
ship's been sunk off Norway...
presumed lost at sea.
As Mank looks out at the desert...
MANK
(to himself)
Always the smartest guy in the
room.
20

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - NIGHT

20

We hear footsteps approaching. MANK'S bed shrouded in
darkness. He lies unmoving as the front door eases open and
RITA enters, her steps tentative.
RITA
You're right, of course. Aircraft
carriers are a shitty idea. But I
don't appreciate the callousness.
I expect more of you.
Silence.
RITA (CONT'D)
(adamant, won't accept)
Presumed means they don't know.
So, I choose to believe he is
alive until s(drawn by his silence)
Mank?... Mank?.... Mister
MANKIEWICZ!?...

36.
INSERT
MANK'S hand opens and a miniature scotch bottle rolls out
of it, like the swirling glass snowball in Citizen Kane.

EXT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Houseman's taxi arrives, Houseman hurries inside.
22

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

22

RITA and FRAULEIN FREDA hover over MANK as a DOCTOR is
packing up to leave. HOUSEMAN arrives.
DOCTOR
He's all right. Just sleeping.
HOUSEMAN
Well, I shouldn't wonder. There's
enough Seconal in those little
bottles to bring down a bull
elephant in heat.
(as others stare at him)
Young Orson doesn't believe in
chance.
23

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - NEXT DAY
CLOSE-UP, MANK
Framed against the pillow, MANK opens his eyes.
HIS POV
A homey, ranch-style tableau. RITA and HOUSEMAN sorting
through pages.
MANK
(gazing at the ceiling)
Houseman, you sly thing. You
slipped me a mickey.
HOUSEMAN
So we did. Though how you managed
to reach it so early in your
rehabilitation I cannot imagine.
How was it - mother's milk?

23

37.
MANK
On balance, better than nothing. I
plan to use it as a nightcap.
RITA
As you Yanks say, he 'went out
like a light.'
Grasping the bar over his bed, MANK pulls himself upright.
MANK
I couldn't have put it better
myself, Mrs. A. Which may be why I
write for the movies.
RITA
Will you stop? You write for the
movies because you're super at it.
Excuse me, you two. I've masses of
typing to do.
RITA goes back to typing. The MEN exchange looks.
HOUSEMAN
(putting pages in
order...)
76 pages...by the time she
translates your red chicken
scratches it will be less than
forty - At this rate, you will
never finish...
MANK
What I want to know is what you
think of it?
HOUSEMAN
(after a beat)
Of course the writing is firstrate, but you know that. His lust
for power, your exquisite
evocation of his hunger for love
from those who fear his worst
side. ButMANK
The dreaded, yet foreseeable BUT...
FRAULEIN FREDA comes with MANK'S food tray. He digs in.

38.
HOUSEMAN
You're asking a lot of a motion
picture audience. All in all it's
a bit of a jumble.
MANK
Did you say jumble or jungle?
HOUSEMAN
A hodgepodge of talky episodes. A
collection of fragments that leap
around in time, like Mexican
jumping beans.
MANK
Welcome to my mind, Old Sock.
HOUSEMAN
The story is so scattered I'm
afraid one will need a roadmap.
MANK
You mean it's a mess.
HOUSEMAN
Would you consider simplifying?
MANK
As Pascal once said, "if only I'd
had more time I would have written
a shorter letter."
HOUSEMAN
All I am saying is, no one can
write like that.
MANK
But I can write like that
Houseman. I have. The narrative is
one big circle, like a cinnamon
roll. Not a straight line pointing
to the nearest exit. You cannot
capture a man's entire life in two
hours...all you can hope is to
leave the impression of one.

39.
HOUSEMAN
Nobody expects Shakespeare. People
aren't spending their hard earned
25 cents to see Macbeth.
MANK
“Maestro the dog-faced boy”
Macbeth.

did

HOUSEMAN
"Voodoo Macbeth." Don't be fooled.
He's a showman. A busker reveling
in sleight of hand. Save yourself
the trouble, be done in sixty
days...
MANK
He'll get this. And the audience
will, too. Stop worrying. Have a
pickle.
HOUSEMAN
No thank you, I'm not hungry.
Haven't been since we got here.
(collecting pages)
Cheerio. Write hard. Aim low.
HOUSEMAN leaves.
RITA gets her pad, comes to MANK'S bed.
MANK
Where were we, chief?
RITA
What are you going to do?
MANK
About what?
RITA
He's right you know. You won't be
done 'til Christmas.
What?

MANK

RITA
You made a promise.

40.
MANK
I did what?
RITA
60 days is two weeks from now.
He doesn't say anything...annoyed.
MANK
Where were we?
RITA
(consulting her notes)
Bernstein's speech...The young
woman on the ferry boat.
MANK
Read it back, please.
As she reads:
24

EXT. FERRY BOAT DECK - DAY

24

The YOUNG WOMAN idling on the deck of a ferry, all in
white. It is SARA.
RITA (V.O.)
A white dress she had on - and she
was carrying a white parasol - and
I only saw her for one second and
she didn't see me at all - but
I'll bet a month hasn't gone by
since, that I haven't thought of
that girl.
25

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY
RITA looks up at MANK, smiles warmly.
RITA
A snapshot from the Mankiewicz
family album?
MANK
You might say that.
RITA
It really is a gorgeous -

25

41.
MANK
(overlapping)
- spot to get stuck.
Mank's lost momentum, thrown off by Houseman's admonitions.
RITA
Is Bernstein meant to be Louis
Mayer?
MANK
If form follows function...
RITA
Mayer's the same pathetic sort of
lap dog to our Charles Foster?
MANK
Oh, Bernstein's a far nicer
character.
RITA
You don't much like Mayer.
His face gone to granite.
MANK
If I ever go to the electric
chair, I'd like him to be sitting
in my lap.

LEGEND:

EXT. MGM STUDIOS - DAY - 1933 (FLASHBACK)
MANK and his brother JOE stride toward MAYER'S office.
JOE
Seven-fifty a week? That's half
what you make, Herman.
MANK
You're a junior writer, Joe.
So?

JOE

42.
MANK
So you're only half the wit your
big brother is. How many half-wits
make that?
JOE
(sarcastic)
Ha! Herm. How do I look?
MANK
You look like you - fine.
JOE
What should I be expecting?
MANK
You're related to me. He already
thinks you're a genius.
Enough...

JOE

MANK
The job will be yours if you can
do two things. One. Don't roll
your eyes. Two. Try not to fall
asleep.
27

INT. MAYER'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

27

MAYER'S SECRETARY, and two other ASSISTANTS, sit busy at
their desks, case-hardened to the RUCKUS seen through the
open door to MAYER'S inner office.
MAYER (O.S.)
This isn't Gower Gulch. You want
us to make a picture about a
prostitute?
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Oh, what's wrong with that? My
mother was nothing but a whore.
There is the SOUND of a CRASHING BLOW and JOHN GILBERT
catapults through the doorway. MAYER charges out and hovers
over him, fists balled, face contorted in a fury.

43.
MAYER
You would talk about your own
mother that way? The woman who
gave you life? You ungrateful
bastard! I oughta cut your balls
off!
GILBERT
Do it, you fucking junk dealer!
I'll still be the better man.
MAYER decides he won't dirty himself by going any
further... Gilbert walks away rubbing his chin...Mank
brings Joe over...
MANK
L.B., this is my brother, Joe.
MAYER
Nice tameetcha Joseph, I'm Louis
Mayer.
MANK
I can't tell you what this means
to him, Louis.
Joe gives him a look.
A MAYER SECRETARY
They're all there Mr. Mayer...
MAYER
I'm on my way. Joe, walk with me.
He moves quickly along the hallway, Joe and Mank at his
side.
MAYER (CONT'D)
My boy, there are three work rules
at this studio. Rule number one.
Ars Gratia Artis. Art for Art's
sake.
A MAN passes by, giving L.B. an anxious wave...
MAYER (CONT'D)
(to employee)
How ya doing?
(to Joe)

44.
MAYER (CONT'D)
One million dollars a year we
spend on stories we never even
film.
He slows to sign something thrust at him, then charges on.
MAYER (CONT'D)
Why not? I'll tell you. They don't
make me cry. What makes me cry?
Emotion. Where do I feel emotion?
Here -(he taps his forehead)
here -(he taps his heart)
-- and here.
(he grabs his crotch)
They turn the corner, wheeling like Grand Prix racers.
MAYER (CONT'D)
Rule number two: You may have
heard M-G-M has more stars than
there are in the heavens. Do not
believe this.
A woman walks by and gives a tentative wave...
MAYER (CONT'D)
Hi'ya (moving on)
We have only one star, that is Leo
the Lion. Never forget that. Many
stars have, and now they twinkle
elsewhere. Rule number three - People think M-G-M stands for
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It does not.
It stands for Mayer's Ganza
Mishpoka - Mayer's Whole Family.
Never forget that. You got a
problem, you come to poppa. This
is a business where the buyer gets
nothing for his money but a
memory. What he bought still
belongs to the man who sold it.
That's the real magic of the
movies and don't let anybody tell
ya different.

45.
WHEELING HURRIEDLY TOWARD A SOUND STAGE DOOR
Where a fearful AIDE waits to usher MAYER in.
MAYER stares at the floor a beat, gearing himself up, then
looks up at the Aide and nods. He's worked himself up, his
eyes gleam with tears. He makes his way inside. Mank and
Joe follow.
28

INT. SOUND STAGE - DAY

28

The sound stage has bleachers and all the STARS in the
heavens sit waiting for him, typifying Hollywood's most
glamorous and powerful studio. The other members of the M-GM family, the laborers, stand crowding the soundstage.
Seeing him, there's an eruption of applause. Mank and Joe
find space against a wall, fascinated.
THEIR POV
Mayer standing, head down with "humility," taking their
applause. He lifts his hands as if to say, "It's too
much..." When they've finished:
MAYER
I find myself in a horrendous
position...And I come to all of
you on bended knee...
He stops to let that resonate...the all powerful L.B. Mayer
laid low...
MAYER (CONT'D)
We are suffering, as all Americans
are, from our country's terrible
economic woes. Good people -everyday people can't afford to go
to the movies, so even our preeminent dream-factory is in grave
financial difficulty.
He bows his head at even the thought...
MAYER (CONT'D)
(raising his head, chin
out, mock dignified)

46.
MAYER (CONT'D)
I am asking everyone in the M-G-M
family to take a painful step. I
am asking to roll back salaries.
He looks at each and every face...
MAYER (CONT'D)
I don't want to, but for this
hallowed place to continue to
exist, I am forced to. I won't
break up this family over
something like money.
There, he's said what he had to...He stands still as if
stricken to his core. Once they've digested that...
A MAN'S VOICE (OVER)
How long are you asking for?
MAYER
Shouldn't be long.
ANOTHER MAN
How much are you asking for?
Half...
Half?

MAYER
ANOTHER MAN

MAYER
Could be less...
ANOTHER MAN
Is everybody going to be "pitching
in?" Are you, Mr. Mayer?
MAYER
Real families root for each other
in the good times. Take care of
each other in tough ones.
OLDER MAN
We're with you, L.B.
The Stars shine bright with that...but there's a lone
VOICE...

47.
YOUNGER MAN
You may be, Mister Barrymore -but a fifty percent pay cut for
grips and electricians?
The stars murmur looking with contempt at the young man.
MAYER
Eight weeks, my friends! Eight
short weeks! As soon as FDR
reopens the banks... you'll get
back every penny! On that...you
have the sacred word of L.B.
Mayer.
ELDERLY FEMALE STAR
(easing to her feet)
Well, I vote yes.
MOVIE STAR #2
I do as well.
CHILD STAR
(leaping up, his muppet
voice)
Me, too!
Which brings them to their feet CHEERING. And MAYER hurries
out, as if unable to handle the torrent of emotion that
engulfs him. MANK and JOE look at each other...
29

INT. SOUND STAGE - DAY
MAYER
(softly)
How'd I do, Ben?
BEN
It was great, Mr. Mayer.
MANK and JOE watch MAYER and his AIDE stride off.
MANK

Not even the most disgraceful
thing I've ever seen...

EXT. PATIO VICTORVILLE (1940) - NIGHT

The camera TRACKS through shadows toward MANK'S bed, amid
muted ORGIASTIC MOANS and urgent WHISPERS: "You like zat?"
"Ummm...That's wonderful." "A little to zuh left, maybe."
"Yeah." FRAULEIN FREDA is raking under MANK'S cast with a
CHINESE BACK-SCRATCHER. MANK twists over just as RITA
enters in a hurry.
RITA
I've got to rush into town to get
typewriter ribbon. Here are the
morning's pages.
MANK
Dreck. It's all dreck!
RITA
Don't flagellate. At least you're
writing again.
MANK
(downcast)
None of it sings. None of it. Not
a note.
RITA
(walking away)
You're not writing an opera.
As she leaves: The PHONE RINGS.
FRAULEIN FREDA
(answering)
Hello?
MANK
(to himself)
But I am writing an opera.
FRAULEIN FREDA
It's for you.
MANK answers the phone.
Yeah?

MANK

JOE (V.O.)
Herman it's Joe -

49.
MANK
Hey, hey, kid...what's up?
JOE (V.O.)
Checking in. How are you getting
around?
Gingerly.
Any rest?

MANK
JOE (V.O.)

MANK
Haven't seen a sunrise yet.
JOE (V.O.)
You've never seen a sunrise.
MANK
Sara said you wanted this number.
JOE (V.O.)
Just to hear your voice.
MANK
Oh, she said you had some work you
wanted to talk about...
JOE (V.O.)
Ahhh, I was thinking about that
old play, "The Wild Man of
Borneo." The one you wrote in the
Ice Age.
MANK
One never remembers one's
disasters. It's considered gauche.
JOE (V.O.)
A play is never a disaster, till
the movies say it is. I brought it
to my people at the studio. We
want W.C. Fields, and we want you
to adapt...
MANK
Uh, I'm kind of on something right
now.

50.
JOE (V.O.)
I can get you paid for the play
and the adaptation.
MANK
Sounds great...But I'll have to
think about it.
JOE (V.O.)
You know how these things have
their moment.
MANK
So this isn't an offer, it's a
subtle ultimatum.
JOE (V.O.)
Nobody could ever tell you what to
do.
MANK
Did Sara put you up to this?
JOE (V.O.)
Not at all. But I know how things
are... I can tell by her voice.
MANK
How bad is that, baby brother?
JOE (V.O.)
How bad? I went to a party last
night where Scott Fitzgerald
referred to you as a "ruined man."
That's how bad things can get.
MANK
(laughing)
That's good. I may use that.
Herman --

JOE (V.O.)

MANK
Please stop Joey, and just tell me
what's on your mind.
JOE (V.O.)
I hear you're hunting dangerous
game.

51.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Word on the street is radio's
Golden Boy wants to go toe to toe
with Willie Hearst and you're
helping in the kitchen.
MANK
Oh? And...?
JOE (V.O.)
And? Herman, and?
MANK
How stupid of me. I thought I was
rejecting a humiliating handout
when all the time I was nixing a
respectable bribe.
JOE (V.O.)
And I'm sorry I ever cared.
The phone CLICKS DEAD in MANK'S ear and ours.
Oops.

MANK

He hangs it up. But he's rattled.

SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:

INT. SAN SIMEON ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT - 1933 (FLASHBACK)
We crane from on high through a huge chandelier looking
over what was called The Assembly Room. A birthday cake
with sparklers (honoring the 4th of July) is being wheeled
to L.B. Mayer. The cake says "Happy Birthday L.B." with
Lady Liberty on it. Mayer is standing before a large
gathering of people, studio moguls, most famously Irving
Thalberg and David O. Selznick, as well as stars like
Chaplin, Lombard, Garbo...The wives cluster, as do young
men looking for available prizes. Marion is in a gaggle of
actresses, and we see Mank straddling the two worlds. Sara
is protectively near Mank, who, for courage and solace,
grabs two drinks off a waiter's passing tray.

52.
The cake arrives, the gathered singing 'Happy Birthday,'
Mayer basking in the light of the sparklers...he tries to
blow them out which isn't physically possible. The cake is
taken away to be cut. There's the sound of a spoon tapping
glass...host William Randolph Hearst commands the room...
HEARST
Marion and I are so pleased you
could all come stay for the
weekend. I hope the train ride
wasn't too arduous.
Which they appreciatively chuckle at. Hearst, raising his
glass...
HEARST (CONT'D)
And tonight we're celebrating our
great friend's birthday in our
little hillside home.
Charlie And with that, the room sings "Happy Birthday" to MAYER...
HEARST (CONT'D)
Louis, you should be joyous, you
don't look a day over forty-eight.
MAYER
I feel thirty-five.
Great applause.
MAYER (CONT'D)
Mister Hearst, Marion, all of you,
my heart is full to bursting. I
can't express in words...
MANK
(to himself)
Please don't try.
MAYER
W.R., nothing is more precious to
me than your friendship and sage
advice. I am blessed to call you
my friend. God bless William
Randolph Hearst.
Everybody agrees...

53.
MANK
("Tiny Tim")
God bless us everyone.
They affectionately applaud...
MANK (CONT'D)
A very happy birthday Louis. Our
country should be flattered that
you picked its birthdate as your
own. The rest of us have to be
satisfied with the one we happen
to be born on.
Mank --

SARA

MANK
(a mock toast)
Here's to your rich Canadian
imagination.
They all repeat "Rich Canadian imagination..." And all
applaud against a round of "hear hear's." Sara reaches over
to stop Mank going any further...
ANGLE ON MAYER
Cake mid-mouth, his expression stuck...when Hearst, as if
the comment has just reached him, roars his appreciation of
Mank... Thalberg makes sure the moment passes by
toasting...
THALBERG
Here's to banks re-opening!
Which is roundly cheered by one and all...
HEARST
(raising his glass)
And to freedom.
They echo him, "To Freedom." They drink their appreciation.
HEARST (CONT'D)
I believe you've met our
distinguished guest, Mr. Rexford
Tugwell. Now, Rex is special
assistant to President Roosevelt.

54.
HEARST (CONT'D)
And we're all interested in what
you might share with us.
There are incongruous chuckles at the mingled politics, and
applause for the special assistant...
HEARST (CONT'D)
And...we all want to welcome the
Thalbergs back from Irving's long
convalescence in Europe.
More applause.
THALBERG
Thank you, W.R.
HEARST
Good to see you, Irving.
NORMA SHEARER THALBERG
Thank you, Mister Hearst.
Norma.

HEARST

And as the "ceremonial" part of the evening ends and starts
to settle into...
CHARLIE CHAPLIN
(at the piano - suddenly
tickling the ivories)
Anybody seen anything good
lately...?
MARION
(enthusiastic)
I just saw 42nd Street.
(Brooklyn-ese)
It blew my wig.
MANK
You can take the girl out of BedStuy...
HEARST
(to Marion)
When was that?

55.
MARION
Over the weekend - you were in
D.C. I went to the pictures in
Santa Barbara.
HEARST
We have a fine screening room here
MAYER
A Warner's picture -- why waste
money on that?
HEARST
Next time, I'll go with you.
MARION
Of course.
(going on)
I am bonkers about Movietone News,
I love Lowell Thomas' voice...
ACTRESS #1
Oh! Is he single?
ACTRESS #2
I sat across from him at the Brown
Derby once. He bought me a drink.
ACTRESS #3

He didn't!

ACTRESS #2
Not - technically. But I made sure
to run into him in the parking lot
after. I asked him, "Do you need a
lift?"
ACTRESS #3
You didn't! What'd he say?
ACTRESS #2
I'll never tell.
She secretly smiles...which brings gales of laughter,
including Marion's.
HEARST
(to no-one in particular)
There is a point to this dear?

56.
MARION
Well yes, they showed that Hitler
giving a speech...kissing
babies...He's (a shiver)
creepers...
MANK
Lederhosen and suspenders,
terrifying.
CHARLIE CHAPLIN
Oh, no. It's the moustache that's
the horror...
HEARST
Don't be alarmed, Marion. He won't
be around for long. The Germans
are a thoughtful, considerate
people. Enough about Nazis.
Irving, tell us about your
travels. Where were you?
THALBERG
Uh, Berlin, in fact.
There's an audible groan.
THALBERG (CONT'D)
But it was quite interesting -NORMA SHEARER THALBERG
Thugs in brown shirts goosestepping past our hotel all night,
screaming anti-Semitic slogans...
I was terrified the whole time.
MARION
This Hitler sounds like an utter
drip. Shouldn't the United States
do something, Mr. Tugwell?
TUGWELL
We are weighing all options.
THALBERG
Can't last. Who in the world takes
a lunatic like that seriously?

57.
MANK
Well, the last time I looked,
forty million Germans.
SARA
Sweetheart --

HEARST
(deep throated laugh)
Mank, you are always so
wonderfully contrary!

MARION
(giggling, to build on
his joke)
"Chase and Sanborn's der coffee,
can forty million Nazis all be
wrong?"
Which falls flat, except to Mank who gives her the courtesy
of a chortle...
MANK
I just read they've opened their
first concentration camps and
started burning books. What's
next, movies?
SARA
(quietly)
Enough.
MAYER
Is that true, Irving?
Yes, L.B.

THALBERG

MAYER
Hitler Shmitler. You don't turn
your back on a market as big as
Germany.
(aside to THALBERG)
What's a concentration camp?
HEARST
Please, it's upsetting enough
Marion had to endure the man in
newsreel.

58.
MARION
It was fascinating. Those people
adore him.
(self conscious)
I'm probably talking nonsense.
MANK
You're the first tonight that
isn't.
Which causes Hearst to laugh, changing the conversation...
SELZNICK
Speaking of socialists, how about
Upton Sinclair's new book?

No..

HEARST
(overlapping)

SELZNICK
He wants to turn private
enterprise over to the state of
California.
MAYER
There's one we won't be optioning - eh Irving?
NORMA SHEARER THALBERG
Well, it's selling like crazy.
IRENE SELZNICK
Walter Winchell says Sinclair may
run for governor next election.
MAYER
That rat Bolshevik belongs right up
there with Hitler on the list of
people not to be taken seriously.
MANK
There's a world of difference
between Communism and Socialism.
MAYER
They both want something for
nothing.

59.
MANK
Like a work force for free?
THALBERG
...Half -- and only in the
interim...
HEARST
I think it’s safe to assume that
none of us here would welcome a
crusading Socialist as
California's political savior.
Certainly not FDR. Am I right,
Rex?
TUGWELL
Off the record? The president says
the man bears watching. Especially
now that Republicans seem bent on
running... (looks to Mayer) Frank
Merriam again.
Others LAUGH derisively. MAYER GRUNTS.
THALBERG
Sinclair's run twice before and
got what, two percent of the vote?
HEARST
(a genial put-down)
Good people: the man is an author.
Which brings sounds of accordance...all except for:
MANK
As was Thomas Jefferson.
HEARST
Come now, Mank - Upton Sinclair as
Thomas Jefferson?
MANK
No, you're right. W.R. Jefferson
never got Federal laws passed to
ban oil monopolies, the railroad
trusts, or cleaned up the
stockyards.

60.
THALBERG
He's an angry scribe - a
provocateur.
MANK
Because he provokes thought.
THALBERG
You always side with the "writer",
Mank. Poor souls surviving a
depression on five grand a week.
Commies.

MAYER

THALBERG
L.B.'s not wrong.
MANK
Irving, you're a literate man. You
know the difference between
Communism and Socialism. In
Socialism, everyone shares the
wealth. In Communism, everyone
shares the poverty.
THALBERG
Thank you, Mr. Mankiewicz -MANK
Upton just wants you to apportion
some of your Christmas bonus,
Irving, to the people who clean
your house.
HEARST
(enjoying)
Now that's why I always want Mank
around!
Me too!

MARION

THALBERG
(scoffing)
"Upton," Mank? Nobody's asking to
hear you sing "The
Internationale."

61.
MARION
What's that?
HEARST
The Communist National Anthem,
darling.
MARION
(taking him literally)
I would. Do you sing?
MANK
No one should have to hear me
sing. Isn't that right, Sara?
SARA
If at all possible.
MAYER
Well, as Republican State chairmanelect, I'm telling you: nothing's
going to happen here. The people
who count in California won't let
it. All this talk is so much
pissing in the wind.
MANK
Nicely put.
MRS. MAYER rouses herself to a fearful, nervous smile.
Marion, wanting to redeem herself in the eyes of Hearst:
MARION
I heard Pops on the phone helping
pick the president's cabinet, like
casting a movie. They can stop a
guy like Sinclair. Couldn't you,
Pops?
A LEADEN SILENCE descends.
MARION (CONT'D)
Pardon. I don't know what I'm
saying.
She stands unsteadily and leaves. Mank looks after her. He
looks at Sara.
Go.

SARA

62.
Mank leaves.
ANGLE ON SARA
Her expression warring between sad, uncertain and lost.
32

EXT. SAN SIMEON GROUNDS - NIGHT

32

Mank follows...He sees Marion stop on a grassy hill, plop
herself down, and grope the base of a marble bench looking
for something. Mank sits, and sees she's pulling out of all
things, a radio-telephone, which sets her off on a geyser
of giggles.
MARION
'Lo, Tokyo? London, you theah?
Ah, nerts!
MANK
What is that?
MARION
Aaahhhhhhhh, Pops' radio-phones.
Nevah, evah be out of touch with
your empire!
MANK
No, no, what's nerts?
MARION
Oh, nerts is Brooklynese for
"nuts"...
Jeepers.

MANK

Which again breaks her up as she puts the phone
back...She's found a half-drunk gin bottle. They sit on the
bench.
MARION
What did I do that was so
terrible? I guess I shouldn't have
said that thing about the cabinet
in front of Tugwell. But since
when does anybody care what I have
to say? Those things just pop out
of my mouth. And the moment they
do I feel like - like --

63.
MANK
Like you got caught "Jambes en
L'air..."
MARION
(gasps)
No!...Well... Do you always just
say whatever you think?
MANK
You're blushing.
MARION

Am not.
Are, too.

MANK

Am not...

MARION

MANK
Are, too. I can see it -- even in
the dark...
MARION
Well, what I can tell you, Mank.
Marion Douras went to convent
school.
MANK
HEDDA? LOUELLA! Where's a gossip
columnist around this castle when
you need one?
They LAUGH together.
MARION
I hate shoptalk! I never know
what's going on.
(confiding)
The one thing you nevah evah talk
about is Upton Sinclair.
MANK
I noted. The moment he's mentioned
the evening turns.
MARION
It's sort of a sore subject.

64.
Mank pulls her to her feet.
MANK
Really? Do tell.
33

EXT. ANIMAL PARK - NIGHT

33

They walk a series of terraced stairwells -- passing
wrought-iron fences, behind which scream all manner of
primates.
MARION
I don't even know who this Mister
Sinclair is...but he wrote about
us for a book. I used to quote it
word for word.
(closing her eyes)
"I saw our richest newspaper
publisher keep his movie mistress
in a private city of palaces and
cathedrals, furnished with
shiploads of junk imported from
Europe, and surrounded by vast
acres reserved for use by zebras
and giraffes..."
(going on)
" -- telling in jest that he had
spent six million dollars to make
his lady's reputation, and using
his newspapers to celebrate her
change of hats..."
MANK
It must be hard to be on the
receiving end of that.
Marion opens her eyes.
MARION
People think because you're on the
cover of "Modern Screen," they
know you.
Mank nods sympathetically. But she is a perennial optimist.
MARION (CONT'D)
Awww nerts, what do I have to
complain about?

65.
MARION (CONT'D)
I live in a fishbowl, but anything
I want is mine... (pause) If I
could I'd share with everyone, you
know that Mank. This "Upton"
doesn't know a thing about the
real...
The sound of the monkeys intrudes...she smiles...
MARION (CONT'D)
Nobody but nobody makes a monkey
out of William Randolph Hearst!
They wander off, giggling...
34

EXT. ANIMAL PARK - NIGHT
MANK
I understand why Mayer loathes
him.
Why?

MARION

MANK
Sinclair caught Louis with his
pants down.
MARION
(shivers)
Yikes.
MANK
He wrote that Mayer took a bribe
to look the other way so a rival
could buy M-G-M...It's
complicated.
MARION
Over my head?
MANK
Over mine. You'd need a degree in
larceny.
MARION
Isn't bribery a crime?

34

66.
MANK
That's what Sinclair said. The
little sausage might have gone to
jail.
Jeepers.

MARION

MANK
Oh, the hypocrisy. "My Ganza
Mishpoka." "My Mishpoka."
MARION
(giggles)
I don't speak a lot of Jewish...
MANK
Really. "My Mishpoka." "My
Family." Everything he does is for
family. Except when it comes to
selling his last name to a
competitor in the middle of the
night.
MARION
Wow, he would do that to his own
studio?
MANK
He doesn't own MGM any more than
Sam Goldwyn...They just run it for
the money-boys back east.
(meaning elephants)
And jail is not something an
animal like Mayer is likely to
forget.
35

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ANIMAL PARK - NIGHT
They walk by the GIRAFFES.
MARION
Irving must be clean. He looks
like he shaves three times a day.
MANK
Well, there's clean and there's
clean. Irving bought one of
Sinclair's novels.

35

67.
MANK (CONT'D)
Sinclair demanded a guarantee that
not one word could be changed, in
writing, on the back of the
purchase check.
MARION
(in mock horror)
He didn't want notes from Irving
Thalberg?
MANK
When Thalberg refused, Sinclair
took his money and ran off to
Mexico, and financed a picture
about the Russian Revolution.
(points to giraffes)
Now that's sticking the old neck
out...
They arrive at a FORMAL GARDEN.
36

EXT. A FORMAL GARDEN - NIGHT

36

Full of statuary. MARION begins to dance. As MANK watches,
she whirls about, faster and faster, until she comes out of
it dizzy. MANK catches her.
MANK
Sorry...instinct.
MARION
My fault...I've been a little
sixes and sevens recently...
(a pause)
Tell me something Mank, the
truth...could you see me playing
Elizabeth Barrett Browning? Or
Marie Antoinette? Irving's bought
'em both, ya know -(sotto voce)
Because of Pops. What'd'ya think,
and... Honestly?
MANK
I see you more as Dulcinea.

68.

Who?

MARION

MANK
Dulcinea. From the Spanish for
sweetness.
OHHH?

MARION

MANK
Her hair gold, her cheeks roses -Nice!

MARION

MANK
-- her lips coral, her neck
alabaster, her bosom marble...
MARION
(giggling)
Marble?! Maybe, once!
MANK
- Ivory her hands, and her
whiteness snow.
MARION
You wrote that?
MANK
No, a fella named Cervantes.
(clears throat)
"There are meters of accent/ And
meters of Tone/ But the best of
all meters/ Is to meet her alone."
MARION
Ah ha! A pome with a message!
They sit on a bench among the statues.
MANK
That's just the first verse. The
last: There are letters of accent/
And letters of tone/ But the best
of all letters/ Is to let her
alone.

69.
MARION starts to LAUGH...
MANK (CONT'D)
(continuing; gently)
Now, those I wrote.
She looks at him. And tired as much as anything, she puts
her head on his shoulder. And Mank lets her keep it there.
DISSOLVE TO:
37

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - THAT NIGHT

37

We see a good number of pages with scribbled notes all
crumpled on the floor. Rita has to avoid them so as not to
bother Mank. She bends to the wastebasket and seeing there
are two empty miniature bottles this time, she retrieves
them. As he sleeps the sleep of the dead...
38

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW (1940) - DAY

38

The stack of notebooks has grown knee-high...Mank works in
bed, pages scattering, blown by a ceiling fan that clanks
from overuse. Mank, sweating, looks like he's been up all
night -- and he has -- although how much is usable may be
reflected by the number of wadded up pages...He's in
trouble. There's a knock on the door.
MANK
(scribbling)
Do come in.
And Rita comes in, bringing in with her the harsh light of
day. Mank, like a vampire, shields his eyes...
MANK (CONT'D)
Jesus! What is that?
RITA
Sunlight. It's nearly noon.
MANK
...Mother of God...where did the
night go?
RITA
Your support device is here.
MANK
Oh good, send it in.

70.
RITA
(the bad news)
As is Mr. Houseman...
Rita is concerned about something beyond the usual...a
whiff of deception in the air...
RITA (CONT'D)
What would you like me to do?
MANK
Well, send him in too.
But first she motions to someone else. The resort's
handyman, SLIM, enters...surveying the room.
MANK (CONT'D)
(motioning)
Uh, put it over there, please...
The handyman moves a chair and ottoman, making space, and
shuffles back out...Rita clears the door. Houseman stops
dead in his tracks seeing Mank in flop sweat. Mank gathers
his pages.
MANK (CONT'D)
You're early...
Seeing Houseman's solemnity, he realizes there's serious
business...
HOUSEMAN
(quietly)
I thought we should talk...
Mank nods. Houseman slowly takes off his hat, and neatly
folds his coat.
MANK
Why are you wearing a coat?
HOUSEMAN
I always wear a coat.
MANK
Must be 108 degrees.
Houseman shifts to sit on the bed...trying to maintain his
dignity despite it sagging under him...When Slim returns,
wheeling a big wooden box, Fraulein FREDA trails him.

71.
HOUSEMAN
We're at a Rubicon moment, Mank.
MANK
(listening)
Uh-huh -HOUSEMAN
It's not the work, that's
everything we'd hoped it would be.
MANK
(to Slim)
Enough room there?
SLIM
Ah, it should be...
And he starts, wielding a crowbar, loudly prying open the
crate...Rita and FREDA watch him work...
MANK
I'm sorry, John.
HOUSEMAN
(despairing)
You've only written ninety
pages...
MANK
(correcting)
Ninety-one.
HOUSEMAN
And in my expert opinion, you're
hardly out of the first act... I
mean, how do you hope to be done
in 14...?
(looks at watch)
... 13 days...? We gave him our
solemn word we would deliver...
"We?"

MANK

HOUSEMAN
I don't think he is going to take
it very well, not very well at
all.

72.
MANK
You said ninety days. Welles said
sixty. I'm doing the very best I
can.
But Houseman has a one track mind.
HOUSEMAN
We are surely to be axed.
The lid pops off, revealing a hanging maze of steel cable,
pulleys, winches, bars, and ropes. Rita, Freda, and
particularly Mank, look at it with wonder...Slim starts to
take off a large board...
MANK
Not just yet...
Rita, Freda and Mank share a look. Houseman's oblivious.
HOUSEMAN
I've never been fired.
MANK
I've never not been fired.
HOUSEMAN
I don't get fired.
MANK
It's not as unpleasant as you
might imagine. You worry too much,
John. What do you do for pleasure?
The PHONE RINGS. Rita answers it...
RITA
Hello? Yes, he's here... It's
Orson...
HOUSEMAN
(to Mank)
You talk?
Mank is about to take the phone...
RITA
(to Houseman)
He'd like to speak with Mr.
Houseman.

73.

Me?

HOUSEMAN

She nods yes. Houseman reluctantly takes the phone.
Orson.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)

He takes the phone around the corner...out of sight/earshot
of Mank and the others...Mank, Rita and Freda watch the
handyman with the apparatus.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
I came early to see where we were
with -- No. Not at all. Everything
is going absolutely according to -...he can barely finish a sentence without being
interrupted...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Well, that's difficult to say
exactly. Ye-yes, I know the clock
is -- And, as I've told you it's
quite unique... In fact, I would
venture to say one of the most -Yes... well, it will absolutely
need your marvelous -Another interruption...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
-- He's on the mend -And another...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
-- Working tirelessly -And a final...
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Of course. When -- ? I'm on my
way...Yes, hang on...he's right
here...
He brings the phone back to Mank, he, Rita and Freda all
share a look.

74.
HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
He wants to see me right away.
Wouldn't tell me why -(giving him the phone)
- perhaps he will you.
MANK looks to the phone as HOUSEMAN leaves. Then...
Orson.

MANK

WELLES (V.O.)
Tell me what's up, Mank?
MANK
He's getting on my nerves.
WELLES (V.O.)
I sensed that. I told him I had to
see him at once. Hopefully I can
think of a reason before he gets
here.
Welles laughs.
WELLES (V.O.)
I've finished my test for Heart of
Darkness. I'm turning my full
attention to our little project.
MANK
Let there be light.
WELLES (V.O.)
Tell me what to expect?
MANK
I thought you'd want to be
surprised.
Welles laughs.
WELLES (V.O.)
Ha! You're always surprising.
That's why you were my only
choice. No one else is Mankiewicz.
Mank motions to Slim. SLIM removes a plywood panel
revealing two dozen or so quarts of premium scotch secured
in straw for safety and stowed in a rack beneath it.

75.
WELLES (V.O.)
I can almost hear the finish line.
MANK
Uh, we're about to turn a corner.
WELLES (V.O.)
Unto the breach!
And MANK hangs up, nods at SLIM as the others watch...
MANK
Slim, you may tote those lovely
highland beauties to the kitchen.
Fraulein Freda, empty the Mickeys
and start replacing their contents
- raus schnell!
Slim...
As both FRAULEIN FREDA and SLIM start, Mank slips Slim a
ten-spot:
RITA
Thank you, Slim, you may go.
As SLIM leaves, MANK stares at RITA. FRAULEIN FREDA begins
collecting bottles for transport.
RITA (CONT'D)
Mister Mankiewicz, please don't
ask us to help you in this sad
deception.
MANK
My dear Mrs. Alexander. Charlie
Lederer and I went to a great deal
of trouble to engineer this sad
deception. My deadline is two
weeks away - and I intend to...
RITA
It could mean our jobs.
MANK
I do my best thinking before I
fall asleep. And I am sick and
tired of having my evenings end
with the abrupt sensation of being
struck on the head with a croquet
mallet.

76.
RITA
A way of putting it.
MANK
I am not asking you to help.
RITA
You're not.
MANK
I am telling you.
RITA
I'm sorry. I won't be bullied.
You'll have my resignation in the
morning.
RITA turns on her heel and walks out the door. She turns.
RITA (CONT'D)
And I know Fraulein Freda's been
sneaking you nightcaps from the
cabinet. If she continues to
cooperate in this cheap ruse I
shall have no choice but to report
the both of you.
MANK
(beat; grimly)
Fraulein Freda?
FRAULEIN FREDA
Ja, Herr Mank?
MANK
Please do as I instructed.
FRAULEIN FREDA
Ja, Herr Mank.
FRAULEIN FREDA trudges to the kitchen.
39

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

39

FRAULEIN FREDA is methodically pouring Mickeys down the
drain one bottle after another as RITA strides in angrily.
RITA
Freda, you mustn't let him
intimidate you like that!

77.
FRAULEIN FREDA
I am not intimidated Frau
Alexander.
RITA

Then, why?

FRAULEIN FREDA
Herr Mank sponsored my family's
entry into this country. He is
responsible for us getting safely
out of Germany...Legally and
financially...
Really?

RITA

FRAULEIN FREDA
Our entire village he brought
here.
RITA
Entire village?
FRAULEIN FREDA
Over a hundred people. Josef,
Goebbels, the propaganda minister,
will not allow his films to be
shown in the Fatherland.
RITA
I di - I didn't realize.
FRAULEIN FREDA
He wrote a picture about the
Nazis, which no studio anywhere
will dare make.
(looking up)
I assume, If he wishes to drink,
he is a grown man, a good man and
should be treated as such. Nicht
Wahr?
40

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
RITA comes out with two scotches. One she hands to MANK.

40

78.
RITA
Here's to Mank-town. Or is it Mankville?
MANK
Dear Freda. WHAT'S GERMAN FOR
BLABBERMOUTH?
RITA
(raising her glass)
Either you demonstrate you can
handle this, Mankiewicz, or we
will all end up getting sacked.
MANK
(raising his glass)
There's nothing like a vote of
confidence from one's peers.
RITA
(a small smile)
To Mank-berg. Prosit!
MANK
(a big grin)
Mank-heim. Bottoms up.
41

EXT. M-G-M STUDIO - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

41

GRUBBY MEN mill about the gates, hustling small change.
SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:
EXT. MGM STUDIOS - DAY - 1934 (FLASHBACK)
MANK walks toward the entrance. He pauses to light a
cigarette, strikes the match against a MERRIAM-FOR-GOVERNOR
poster.
As he reaches the gate an UNSHAVEN MAN blocks his path.
C.C.
Hey! Mank? You remember me?
MANK
Oh. My God! Of course I remember
you, C.C.
C.C. Starts to shake hands, thinks better of it.

79.
C.C.
C.C. fer Central Castin'. How you
been Mank?
MANK
What happened?
C.C.
What happened? The Goddamned
Depression happened. I ain't had
so much as a walk-on since Tugboat
Annie. Listen: I hate tuh, you
knowMANK pats his pockets, turns to the STUDIO GATE GUARD.
MANK
Uh- yeah. Ed? Lend me a buck?
ED scowls but does so reluctantly. Mank gives it to C.C.
Another PANHANDLER immediately drifts over to join them.
C.C.
Me an' Grady here been thinkin' a
bummin' east tuh Miam-uh.
(secretive,
conspiratorial...)
I heard it from somebody who
knows, the Hollywood studios are
moving to Florida.
MANK
Who told you that?
C.C.
(nods his head, meaning
studio)
Oh, I can't say, but somebody in
the know...(whispers) In certain
echelons, it's common knowledge.
MANK
People in "certain echelons" don't
usually trust me with sensitive
information. But the studios
aren't moving anywhere. That's
just company-town propaganda.

80.
C.C.
Believe what you want. But...Say (indicating GRADY)
You think you could spare Uh, Ed?

MANK

C.C. (O.S.)
Bless you, Mank.
MANK glances again at the GATE GUARD. Shrugging, ED turns
his pants pockets inside out. They are eloquently empty.

INT. M-G-M - COMMISSARY - DAY
MANK and JOE eating lunch.
JOE
The bastard reneged. You were
there...Yes, he reinstated
salaries - but he never gave back
the money he promised.
MANK
Giant surprise.
JOE
Come on, Mank, we need guys like
you to keep people like Mayer
honest.
MANK
I'd refer you for that, to the
power of prayer.
JOE
The Writers Guild doesn't have to
hit the bricks for the twenty-five
hundred-a week guy. We're doing it
for the two-hundred-and-fiftydollar-a-weeker.
MANK
Joe: All the two-hundred-fiftydollar-a-week writers I know, are
getting twenty-five hundred.

42

81.
MANK (CONT'D)
Stop crying for your just desserts
they're liable to give them to
you. Then we'll all be working for
seventy-five bucks a week.
JOE
I don't know if you've ever walked
a picket line...You might have to.
MANK
Dave Chasen'll cater. JUNIOR
WRITERS ONLY PAID SEVEN HUNDRED
FIFTY A WEEK! If that happens, you
better run before real folk with
real troubles stone you to death.
MANK signals for the check, gets it, gives it to JOE.
JOE
Hermie, the Guild's in its
infancy, it needs you.
MANK
(getting up)
You're telling me. What writer
failed to notice the Screen
Writer's Guild needs an
apostrophe.
As Groucho always said: Never
belong to any club that would have
someone like you for a member.
Leaning over, MANK flips JOE'S tie into his coffee.
JOE
And look at him. The most
miserable bastard on God's green
earth.
MANK
I'd tell him you said that... only
he'd think you were brown-nosing.
43

INT. THALBERG'S OFFICE - DAY
Mank enters, seeing Thalberg bending over his fireplace,
batting smoke with a newspaper.

43

82.
THALBERG
Close the door.
He does.
MANK
Aaaaahhhhhhhh. Summer.
THALBERG crosses to his desk.
THALBERG
(into the intercom)
Inez? You're not to let the
Brothers Marx wait in my office,
ever. They've been grilling hot
dogs again.
Mank laughs.
Sit down.

THALBERG (CONT'D)

He takes a chair.
MANK
You wanted to see me?
THALBERG
Not that I care, but why aren't
you contributing to M-G-M's antiSinclair fund...?
MANK
Well, call me old-fashioned,
Irving, but I don't like being
told which side of a fight I'm
already on.
THALBERG
How's it going to look if the GOP
chairman himself can't get
unanimous support from his own
studio?
MANK
You're serious.

83.
THALBERG
(he is serious)
I was taught by my parents to be
straightforward - to ask simply
for what I want, and expect that I
may have to elucidate my position.
MANK
I was encouraged by mine to use my
imagination...but I taught myself
to avoid the consequences.
Which even has Thalberg smile.
THALBERG
It's $10, Mank. You piss that away
between hopeless bets.
Mank doesn't say anything.
THALBERG (CONT'D)
I hate to think what L.B. might do
if he knew you were the only
holdout.
MANK
(delighted)
...I am? And he doesn't?
THALBERG
...And we're not going to tell him.
I could let you go for this.
MANK
It is... a hanging offense...
THALBERG
But I'm just going to add the
appropriate amount to your
gambling debt and forget we ever
had this conversation.
MANK
You do that. And the brandspanking new Writers Guild might
find it verrrry interesting. Not
to mention the newspapers.

84.
THALBERG
I'm not sure the guild intends to
cover "games of chance". And you
won't go to the press, because in
California that means Hearst.
MANK
(disappointed)
Irving, you are the shrewdest
executive in this town, why are
you acting like some dumb ward
heeler? You don't need my
donation. You don't need
anybody's. You have everything it
takes right here.
Mank gets up to go.
Meaning?

THALBERG

MANK
(he stops, turning)
Meaning, you can make the world
swear King Kong is ten stories
tall, and Mary Pickford a virgin
at forty - yet you can't convince
starving voters that a turncoat
Socialist is a menace to every
thing Californians hold dear?
You're barely trying.
And as he leaves THALBERG to think...
44

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES (1934) - DAY

44

MANK and SHELLY stride out of the Biltmore bar to find:
The lot next door thronged with milling SPECTATORS. The
atmosphere is that of a church social. Workers folksily
hawk lemonade, cakes and cookies. On a flatbed truck
festooned with bunting, stands a stooped, graying FIGURE in
a tie and white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up.
UPTON SINCLAIR is speaking. The pince-nez glasses perched
on his nose give him a professorial air that this dry
platform and low, hypnotic monotone do nothing to dispel.

85.
SINCLAIR
(reading his speech)
Millions of Californians (squints as it flaps)
Are being taxed out of their homes
yet the Depression is one of
abundance. Fruit rots on the
ground and vegetables are dumped
into the ocean because there are
no markets for them.
HECKLER
Aimee Semple Macpherson says
you're a godless commie, Upton!
SINCLAIR
Too often, sir, the religion of
Jesus is used by the ruling
classes to keep themselves in
power and the poor ever poorer.
Mank, for the first time really hears him.
SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
And that, my friends, is a sin and
an error -- and I say with Thomas
Jefferson...
Mank smiles to himself at the echo of the reference.
SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
..."Truth has nothing to fear from
error where reason is left free to
combat it."
ANGLE ON MANK AND SHELLY
Listening. There is a SPATTERING OF APPLAUSE. In MANK'S
eyes glints a glimmer of interest. He glances around him.
MANK'S POV
A WOMAN WITH A BABY begins nursing it; a TOOTHLESS OLD MAN
yawns; SINCLAIR is in danger of losing their attention.

86.
SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
(with a quiet passion)
My friends, income in this country
is going to be redistributed by
one of two methods: Legal
enactment or violent revolution.
We haven't much longer to exercise
our choice. Thank you all for
coming.
SUPPORTER
Tell us about Hollywood! Are the
studios really moving to Florida
like they've been sayin'?
SINCLAIR
(more animated)
Absurd, sir! If they were at all
serious why have the brothers
Warner just broken ground on an
additional 100,000 square feet of
sound stages... while M-G-M has
the most contracts with stars in
their history?
SINCLAIR jumps nimbly off his makeshift stage and vanishes
into a crowd of WELL-WISHERS.
TWO-SHOT OF MANK AND SHELLY, FAVORING MANK
SHELLY
Well he might not get Mayer's
vote, but he gets mine.
SINCLAIR (O.S.)
Jobs will be here in California.
Thank you all for coming!
MANK'S eyes are on the CANDIDATE. From his expression we
can guess that SINCLAIR may get his vote too.
45

INT. VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY

45

MANK and TEAM are having a celebratory drink... MANK now
sports a boot-cast and his crutches lean against the wall.
Rita and Freda, never ones to waste a moment's time are
busy boxing up interim drafts, along with discarding pages
of useless ideas...

87.
Houseman is sitting across from Mank, his hand, on the
script as if its very presence is fragile to the touch...
HOUSEMAN
Well, I have seen some miracles in
my day. But I have -(with some kind of awe)
Over two-hundred pages in thirteen
days. I never would have thought
it possible.
MANK
(lifting his glass)
To support devices.
RITA
(her eyes dancing)
Support devices.
FRAULEIN FREDA stifles an embarrassed TITTER. All drink
honoring Mank, including Mank...mostly Mank.
HOUSEMAN
It's good, Mank. Damn good -RITA
(with mischief, TO MANK)
I have it on highest authority:
It's the best thing he's ever
done.
An excuse for Mank to drink again. Houseman moves closer,
private. Mank lights a cigarette.
HOUSEMAN
...As a moving picture it's more
than good...I'm at a loss to even
express...How wealth and influence
can crush a man...It's Lear...the
dark night of the soul...and I was
completely mistaken, the shifting
point of view is revolutionary. I
never thought one could care so
much about a sled...
MANK
It's kind of you to say...
Mank... waiting for the inevitable...

88.

But...

HOUSEMAN

MANK
"But," again...
HOUSEMAN
It's 327 pages...An embarrassment
of riches...When the Dogface Boy
gets here, there will be plenty
branches to prune.
MANK
"A far too long screenplay for the
ages.", John Houseman. I built him
a watertight narrative and I
suggest a destination. Now, where
he takes it, that's his job...
Houseman becomes very quiet. He leans ever more forward, as
if to reveal something at the core of his worries...
HOUSEMAN
I was looking to get you paid...I
don't know if you were aware or
not...you signed your rights to
"the Mercury." You agreed not to
take screen credit.
MANK
I needed the work.
HOUSEMAN
You may want to reconsider.
MANK
All I currently want is a real
shower... a cocktail...and my Sara
to wake up to.
HOUSEMAN
Are you certain?
MANK
It worked out.
Houseman digests that, still troubled...

89.
HOUSEMAN
Mank, if I may be so bold. Why
Hearst? Lord knows, outside his
own blonde Betty Boop you were
always his favorite dinner
partner.
Mank gives it a moment's thought, looking into himself...
MANK
John, are you familiar with the
parable of the organ grinder's
monkey?

INT. MANK'S CAR - MORNING - (FLASHBACK)

SARA wearing a head scarf drives along Wilshire Boulevard.
SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:
EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY - 1934 (FLASHBACK)
THE RADIO PLAYS, Mank - sits beside her, smoking a
cigarette... He scans the Los Angeles Times.
INSERT. FIVE-COLUMN PHOTOGRAPH
A GANG OF HOBOS RIDE A FREIGHT CAR TO CAMERA.
MANK looks at the photograph a little longer maybe than he
needs. Just then his eye catches a passing billboard. 'I
EXPECT HALF THE UNEMPLOYED IN U.S. TO FLOCK TO CALIFORNIA
IF I AM ELECTED' - UPTON SINCLAIR. DO YOU WANT THIS TO
HAPPEN? THE CALIFORNIA CRUSADERS SAY DEFEAT SINCLAIR.
He looks to Sara to see if it caught her attention, but it
didn't...He looks back to the NEWSPAPER considering.

EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

47

Mank, in an unfortunate swim suit, slathered with zinc, is
wrestling an umbrella. Sara, sitting on a blanket near a
portable radio plays music. Mank, making sure not a grain
of sand touches him joins her. He lights another cigarette.
MUSIC ON THE RADIO GIVES WAY TO A COMMERCIAL.

90.
THERE'S THE SOUND OF SOMETHING PLOPPING INTO WATER. THEN A
REFRESHING FIZZING SOUND..."THAT’S THE SOUND OF ALKASELTZER GOING TO WORK!" Mank fiddles with the radio's dial
alights on a station:
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
- Today our roving reporter is
visiting Mrs. Elsie Hammontree of
Azuza. Elsie, would you mind
telling the folks at home why
you're voting Republican.
ELSIE (V.O.)
Young man, I'm a widow and this
little home may not be much, but
it's all I have left - and I
intend to protect it.
SARA
Poor old woman...
It captures both Mank and Sara's ATTENTION.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Mrs. Hammontree, would you mind
telling the folks at home why
you're voting for Frank Merriam?
ELSIE (V.O.)
Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam
because I wanna keep our way of
life.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
You don't think a Democrat would
protect you in these hard times?
MANK
I know that voice...
SARA
(a beat)
It is familiar.
MANK
(realizing)
That's Maude Anderson.

91.
SARA
It is, Aunt Bertha from "Lonely
Trails".
MANK
Well, she's no widow. And she's
absurdly rich. That "poor old
woman" has got enough oil wells
south of El Segundo to buy us
both, Schnutz.
Sara changes the radio channel.
MANK (CONT'D)
I'd know that whiskey gargle
anywhere.
48

EXT. BIG DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

48

MANK and SARA come out. She is overladen with packages, a
fact he ignores as something else catches his attention.
MANK'S POV
It is C.C. He carries a VOTE FOR SINCLAIR sign and patrons
streaming out of the store shun him like the plague.
TRAVEL WITH MANK
C.C.

Hey! Mank.

MANK
(approaching)
Well, well...Looks like you found
work, C.C.
C.C.
Don't nose it around but - yeah,
just in the knick...
Patting his pocket, he takes out a dollar repaying Mank.
MANK
Who's hiring?

92.
C.C.
M-G-M. They cleaned out the
Washington and Culver gates like a
dose a Ex-Lax. Grady gets a
speakin' part. They told us come
dressed as we are...I don't know
who thought of it, but it keeps a
lot of us off the streets.
MANK
Don't forget to vote.
C.C.
(chuckles)
Okay.
49

INT. WRITER'S BUILDING - DAY
The writers are playing poker. SHELLY METCALF eases into
view watching them but he has something on his mind.
KAUFMAN
He's hopelessly confused with
Sinclair Lewis. So many hicks
think he wrote Elmer Gantry -it's cost him the Dust Bowl vote.
I'm in.
MACARTHUR
Ah, poor sap... not only has he
got no money -- he's an idealist,
for Crissakes. Talk about
political handicaps. I'm out.
PERELMAN
Times says he'll lose by twohundred-thousand. It's amazing
what ten million bucks against him
bought. Raise.
HECHT
That's what he gets for
surrounding himself with amateurs.
They not only charge admission to
rallies, they pass a plate once
the suckers are inside. Call.

49

93.
PERELMAN
He's the most famous shlub after
FDR, Hitler and Mussolini. That
oughtta count for something...
Hiya, Shel. Sit in?
SHELLY shakes his head.
HECHT
The bookies know. Soon as ole
Maude's radio spots started
running the odds went from 7-5 for
to 2-1 against.
MANK
Could you effete political snobs
please shut up and play?
SHELLY
Mank, can I talk to you?
MANK
(studying his hand)
I'll see you guys and bump you two
big ones.
SHELLY
It's important.
MANK
(tossing in his cards)
Now, Shelly? It better be. That's
the first good hand I've had all
day.
KAUFMAN
I didn't know he knew what a good
hand looked like.

INSERT. MOVIE SCREEN
A "NEWSREEL" IS RUNNING. AND WE SEE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
BEING "INTERVIEWED," AS TO THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THE
ELECTION WITH A NARRATION BY "YOUR ROVING REPORTER..." Some
are reasonable Merriam supporters, others are claiming to
be for Sinclair.
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
Would you mind telling us who you
favor in this Fall's election?
MAN ON STREET (O.S.)
I'm going to vote for Frank
Merriam...
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
Would you mind telling us your
principle reason?
MAN ON STREET
Well, I want Merriam - Because I
want a job - if you drive all the
capital out of the country - who's
gonna pay us?
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
So you think, erm - that Merriam
would be safest for all of us?
MAN ON STREET
Absolutely - It's no time to trade
horses in the middle of a
stream...
ANOTHER INTERVIEW:
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
Mr. Butler, are you going to vote
in the coming election?
MR. BUTLER
I most certainly am...
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
Who would you wish to vote for?

95.
MR. BUTLER
I'm sure that I'm going to vote
for Mr. Sinclair...
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
You must have a good reason to vote
for Mr. Sinclair...
MR. BUTLER
Well, Mr. Sinclair got something
new - he got that "Epic Plan" and I feel as though it's time we
should try something new out
again... I need prosperity.
ANOTHER INTERVIEW:
MAN IN FRONT OF FENCE
Well, First of all, I'm an
American. And I believe that Mr.
Merriam will support all the
foundations and principles that
this country has stood for in the
past 150 years. I have a job now,
and I want to keep it. My wife and
I love California and we'd like to
stay. But, in case we should have
to leave, I'd like to have at
least a couple dollars.
Cut!

MALE DIRECTOR (V.O)

AND WE SEE IN STOCK FOOTAGE IN A TRAIN YARD A NUMBER OF
"BUMS" HOPPING OFF FREIGHT TRAINS...
AND THEN WE SEE THE FULL INTERVIEW OF ELSIE HAMMONTREE
(MAUDE ANDERSON). "ELSIE" SITS ON THE PORCH OF A SMALL,
NEAT FRAME HOUSE, ROCKING AND KNITTING. A MAN IN A SUIT
(THE ROVING REPORTER) HOLDS OUT A MICROPHONE TO HER.
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
Mrs. Hammontree, would you mind
telling the folks why you are
voting for Frank Merriam?
ELSIE HAMMONTREE
(there's that distinctive
VOICE)

96.
ELSIE HAMMONTREE (CONT'D)
Well, I'm voting Frank Merriam
because I want to keep our way of
life.
ROVING REPORTER (V.O.)
You don't believe a Democrat would
protect your way of life?
ELSIE HAMMONTREE
Why, that man's a Socialist! I
don't know much about politicsbut I do know this: If Upton
Sinclair wins this election,
private ownership in California
won't amount to a hill o' beans.
WIPE LEFT:
INSERT. MOVIE SCREEN - ANOTHER SEQUENCE
The ROVING REPORTER confronts a "BLUE COLLAR WORKER" in a
rundown coastal neighborhood. It is C.C.'s pal, the other

rejuvenation of our system....
So - I vote for comrade Upton, his

There is NO SOUND. On-screen is a moving version of the
front-page photo in the Times. As the Moviola CLICKETYCLICKS, BUMS ride into view atop a caravan of boxcars like
a victorious invading army, smirking into the camera,
waving hello to camera. At the end of it there is some outnegative footage of SHELLY directing the ROVING REPORTER.

SHELLY
What'd'ya think?
MANK
Truthfully, Shelly, if the
performances were any better,
you'd be ashamed of yourself.
SHELLY pours them coffee.
SHELLY
Only half of them are actors...But
it's got that raw newsreel feel,
hasn't it?
MANK
But it isn't news and it isn't
real.
SHELLY
I wasn't looking to have an
ethical debate, Manky.
MANK
When did they cook these up?
SHELLY
At a meeting in production - they
were passing around a pamphlet
Sinclair wrote called "Ending
Poverty in California."
MANK
(knowing)
"America's unemployed will invade
the Golden State..."
SHELLY
Mayer was practically giddy to use
it against him.
MANK
Yeah, I bet he was.
Mank's quiet, troubled.

98.
MANK (CONT'D)
Well, it's enough to persuade me
that the writer is more of a
menace to an unsuspecting public
than a party hack...
Mank...

SHELLY

Shelly starts to hand him a mug and spills the steaming
coffee all over himself.
You okay?

MANK

SHELLY
Just nerves...
Shelly, embarrassed, tries to wipe himself off with
napkins.
MANK
If it's bothering you, Shelly, why
get involved?
SHELLY
They gave me a chance to direct.
Mank nods.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
You don't think anyone old enough
to vote is gonna buy this shit?
MANK

Only the ones that believe King
Kong's ten stories tall or Mary
Pickford a virgin at forty.

INT. THALBERG'S OFFICE - DAY

52

THALBERG and an ART DIRECTOR stand pouring over sketches as
MANK walks in without fanfare. The TWO MEN look up at him.
THALBERG
Thanks, Cedric, these are fine.
The ART DIRECTOR leaves. THALBERG crosses to his desk.

99.
MANK
I've just watched our Sinclair
films.
THALBERG
Ah? What did you think?
MANK
Well, with all due respect to
Shelly, King Kong they ain't.
Though I do think footage of
invading hobos has a certain
xenophobic power - when frontpaged in the Times and backed by
those tacky billboards.
THALBERG sits down. He doesn't invite MANK to do likewise.
THALBERG
Shelly got a chance to direct and
I canceled your twelve thousand
dollar gambling debt. I'd call
that a fair return on a one-minute
lecture for uninspired studio
chieftains.
MANK
Your director's been stricken with
a bout of conscience.
THALBERG
I'm sure he'll tell me himself.
MANK
Don't do this, Irving...
THALBERG
(pausing)
When I was just a boy passing out
Socialist leaflets in the Bronx, a
couple Tammany goons came to show
me the error of my ways. One of
them crushed my testicles until I
volunteered to distribute my wares
into the East River. That's
politics. I didn't invent it, I
don't apologize for it.

100.
MANK
Mayer's not paying for this. He
never pays for anything.
Thalberg slightly smiles.
Willie?

MANK (CONT'D)

Thalberg smiles thinly again.
MANK (CONT'D)
Marion might be interested.
THALBERG
Well, you're gonna have to hurry.
Mayer's over there now giving her
the company kiss off.
MANK just stares.
THALBERG (CONT'D)
Oh. Haven't you heard? She's
taking her playpen to Warner
Brothers. Permanently.
Warner's?

MANK

THALBERG
I wouldn't let her do Marie
Antoinette. Goldwyn's right for
once: "A comedienne in that role
is to laugh." Besides, her
pictures haven't made a dime in a
decade.
He shuffles papers on his desk, signifying dismissal. Mank,
on his way out the door...
MANK
Congratulations, Irving.
THALBERG looks up.
THALBERG
I know what I am, Mank. When I
come to work I don't consider it
slumming.

101.
THALBERG (CONT'D)
I don't use humor to keep myself
above the fray and I always go to
the mat for what I believe in. I
haven't the time to do otherwise.
(a devastating smile)
But you, sir. How formidable
people like you might be if they
actually gave at the office.
(lowering his head)
Close the door.

No, that almost killed me. Where's
Willie?
MARION
Cairo. I think.
MANK
Can you phone him?

MARION
I don't phone him - he phones me.
MANK
When's he due back?
MARION
After November 6.
(a beat)
I'm joining him in Europe next
week.
MANK
Marion, I need a favor. It's just a little joke on Willie.
MARION
Sure, Mank, anything MANK
I want you to go back and tell
Mayer, Willie wants the phony
Sinclair films pulled.
MARION
Which phony Sinclair films?
MANK
There isn't time to explain, I
just need you to tell him that...
MARION
Oh, I couldn't, not even as a
joke.
Why not?

MANK

MARION
You know I don't lie.
MANK
And that's why he'd believe you.
Marion, please, you're not in
convent school anymore.
MARION

sun hat and a khaki windbreaker. RITA, with a pen, a note
pad, and binoculars, is bird-watching.
RITA

Manky!

MANK

RITA
It's an ash-throated flycatcher!
MANK
Congratulations. Best kind.
MANK looks at LEDERER, waits.
LEDERER
What can I say? She's my aunt.
MANK
Oh, it's not about her, it's about
him.
Oh?

LEDERER

MANK
Or rather, it's him but it's not
her.
LEDERER
It isn't? The lonely showgirl,
trapped in a castle, doing jigsaw
puzzles?
MANK
It's more - her as people who
don't know her imagine her to be.
LEDERER
I see. It's her as they imagine
her, but it's "him" as you knew
him.
MANK
Damnit, Charlie LEDERER
You asked me out here. I was
honored to come and read your
latest. Is this a test?
MANK
A test? Of what?
LEDERER
Friendship? Loyalty?

105.
MANK
Oh come now LEDERER
- Or just your way of avoiding
responsibility?
MANK
What do you mean?
LEDERER
Are you hoping I might absolve you
of such a personal betrayal? I
won't give you that.
It honestly hadn't occurred to Mank.
MANK
(he thinks about that)
Are you going to say anything?
LEDERER
I have to think about it.
Why?

MANK

LEDERER
Because I haven't made up my mind
how she might react.
MANK
What does instinct tell you?
LEDERER
That it's mighty strong medicine
for a lifetime of starry-eyed self
absorption.
(pause)
It's one of those cures that could
be worse than the disease. But you
of all people should know about
that.

EXT. TROCADERO NIGHTCLUB - ELECTION EVE - NIGHT - 1934
(FLASHBACK)
There's a California mist in the air, and klieg lights
bathe a nightclub on a wide boulevard...People arrive in
expensive cars, dressed as if for a premiere...We find Mank
and Sara arriving...Sara tugs self-consciously at the waist
of her skirt, making an attempt, if she doesn't feel
fashionable, to at least feel symmetrical.
They make their way through the crush of people inside...

INT. TROCADERO - NIGHT

The CLUB is jammed with MOVIELAND ELITE. A huge FRANK
MERRIAM FOR GOVERNOR banner is draped above the ORCHESTRA,
which plays for the FEW who fox-trot.
THE ROOM:
We find Mank and Sara behind a velvet cord queuing for
their table.
MANK
(shrugs)
Sinclair's yesterday's fishwrap.
Never stood a chance...

107.
SARA
Make up your mind. Are we home
licking our wounds, or are we here
making the best of it?
MANK
(kisses her forehead)
We're making the best of it.
MAITRE 'D
Good evening. Name?
SARA
Mankiewicz.
MAITRE 'D
I'm sorry, what was that?
SARA
(used to it)
M-a-n-k-i-e-w-i-c and outta nowhere... a "z."
MAITRE 'D
(consulting list)
Table fourteen.
SARA
Ends of the earth. A clean exit...
But Mank, having a moment's hubris...
MANK
(to Maitre'D)
Mankiewicz, Herman.
MAITRE'D
(re-consulting)
Oh. Terribly sorry, table one.
Right this way.
Sara gives Mank a look, "who are you?"...
SARA
(fake smile, reminding
him)
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything at all.

108.
The Maitre 'D leads them through busy tables with jeroboams
of champagne and centerpieces designed to look like the
state of California...On the BANDSTAND behind everything is
a TOTE BOARD with a TELEPHONE. An EMCEE IN A TUX and a
SCANTILY-CLAD SHOWGIRL, like a Round Card girl at a prize
fight, are minding oversized numbers to post results. Not
far from them is a RADIO ANNOUNCER doing a live SHOW. At
their table, L.B. MAYER, THALBERG, and SELZNICK along with
their wives. Mayer, taken by surprise, sees Mank, and
graciously rises...
Sarah!

WIFE #1 (O.C.)

MAYER
Good grief! Look who's here! How
about that? What a loyal friend
you are! I never thought we would
see Mank!
Mank, wearing a plastered smile, "holding his water," nods,
takes his hat off. Sara smiles, seeing he's on his best
behavior. Thalberg, equally shocked to see him:
THALBERG
(pleasantly, yet warily)
I'm surprised. I would have
imagined you in pajamas by now...
Sara and Mank exchange "Hollywood kisses" with the wives, a
swirl of inane comments that Mank endures with a smile.
WIFE #1
Mank, turns out we have the same
dentist on Camden.
WIFE #2
Sara, we have to plan a day of
shopping and catch up.
WIFE #3
Herman, I met your brother -- he's
a chip off the old block. Quite
handsome!
Mank smiles, still not saying anything, Sara shocked by his
restraint.

109.
MAYER
Please, sit.
He holds out chairs for them...
MAYER (CONT'D)
I can't tell you how much it
means. I'm touched you would come.
Thank you for this...
And Mank smiles, as if holding his breath. They take their
seats. He looks at Sara.
SARA
(shakes her head)
Why do I love you?
And to emphasize he pours himself a drink from a huge
champagne bottle.
MANK
What's everyone else having?
As they laugh, Sara and Thalberg looking at him both for
different reasons...

Mank, two drinks at his elbow, silently watching: People
dancing...A Man dressed as Uncle Sam on stilts walking
between the tables...A Photographer taking various couples'
pictures...The Radio Announcer doing his show... Mayer,
Thalberg laughing at something, enjoying themselves
immensely. There's a drum roll. The Emcee with the help of
his partially clad helper puts up the most recent
results...giving Sinclair's numbers first, and then
Merriam's. Which brings a loud cheer. Mank stops a waiter,
motioning, "two more." As he stews:

MAYER
What a great night. Great result.
Thalberg sees Mank is listening to them.
THALBERG
I'll drink to that.
And he does.
MAYER
(smug, to Thalberg - but
including Mank)
You see, if you just give people
what they need to know in an
"emotional" way, you can expect
they'll do the right thing.
MANK
I think what you mean, if you keep
telling people something untrue,
loud and long enough, they're apt
to believe it.
Thalberg hears him loud and clear...
THALBERG
That's not what he was saying.
SELZNICK
What's going on here? Are we
quoting Goebbels?
MANK
I'd like to debate that with L.B...
SELZNICK
I'd like to see that.
THALBERG
(trying to defuse...)
Mank -- have another...
MANK
It's early. Every vote counts.
Maybe the informed of California
were late leaving work... Last I
heard, Irving, it's still a
democracy.

111.
THALBERG
Of the people...
MANK
"By the people."
MAYER
What are you two talking about?
MANK
(to hell with it)
I tell you what...How bout -double or nothing?
MAYER
What's he saying?
Herman --

SARA

MAYER
You really will bet on anything.
Keep your money...I'm happy enough
just to nail that Utopian
sonofabitch to the wall.
Which has the ladies laugh, embarrassed...Mank looks into
his glass.
THALBERG
(sotto voce)
I told you. Your obligation was
cancelled, out of gratitude.
MAYER
(overhearing)
Wait a minute. What? He wants to
wager double or nothin' on a debt
he dudn't even owe us?
Mank -- ?

SARA

MANK
It's a matter of principle, L.B.
You wouldn't understand.
MAYER
I understand plenty -- I'll take
that bet --

OK, Mank, you're on. Twenty-four

We see the most recent posting of vote totals. Merriam
still ahead by a healthy third. Mank, stewing looks around
the room. A drunk man teeters, seems to right himself, and
then falls over to his table's delight. Even the man on
stilts has found a place to rest. Sara returns...
SARA
I needed some air...
Music cranks up... He takes her onto the dance floor.
MANK
Why do you love me?
Her answer is to put her head on his shoulder...There's
chiming of spoon on glass...Mayer calling the room to
attention...
MAYER
Excuse me, friends.
(clears throat)
The final incomplete count for
tonight is: Upton Sinclair...
(looking up)
The lousy Bolshevik...
Mocking laughter and CATCALLS.
MAYER (CONT'D)
- Seven-hundred-twenty-eightthousand-six hundred and fifty

Republican - nine-hundred There's a ROAR.

MAYER (CONT'D)

Mayer raises his arms in triumph...
MAYER (CONT'D)
My friends!... My friends! Sing
with me. Everybody, up and sing!
MAYER begins to SING, "America the Beautiful." Others stand
and join them. Mank comes to the table to get Sara's
coat...
THALBERG
(toasts Mank)
It was a team effort. Thanks...
Mank doesn't dignify it with a response...grabbing Sara's
coat...
And while people sing they cross the room to leave...They
pass the Maitre 'D, who stops him...
MAITRE 'D
Mr. Mankiewicz, I'm so sorry to
bother you, but there's a
telephone call for you. Right back
this way...
He leads him to the phone...
MANK
(into phone, under the
SINGING)
Hello?
SHELLY (V.O.)
Mank? It's Shelly...
MANK
(whispers to Sara)
It's Shelly...
SHELLY (V.O.)

He lost, Mank.

114.
MANK
Yeah, it's been a bad night.
SHELLY (V.O.)
It's my fault.
MANK
Easy fella, you only voted once.
SHELLY (V.O.)
He was just on the radio. He said
the phony newsreels cost him the
election.
MANK
That shows how naive he is. FDR
cost him the election by staying
on the sidelines.
(shielding his listening
ear)
Sleep it off.
SHELLY
I'm not at home.
MANK
Where are you? Let me call you a
cab.
SHELLY (V.O.)
Nevermind...I'll take the Pasadena

election night.
The line has gone dead. Mank clicks the cradle on the phone
to get the operator.
MANK
Hello? Hello? Normandie 4761...

He's shit-faced.
It's answered immediately.
YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
Shell? Is that you?
MANK
It's Herman Mankiewicz. Where is

Joe looks at him...
JOE
Herman: This is me. You pick a

Nobody can. Especially the boy
genius from New York.
MANK
You're far too political, Joe.
JOE
Self preservation is not politics.
He studies his older brother...
JOE (CONT'D)
Him I get. But what did Marion
ever do to deserve this?
MANK
(defensive)
It's not her! You know better than
anyone: not all characters are
headliners. Some are secondary.

JOE
Well, that's why I'm here. On
behalf of the secondary
characters.
Mank's quiet...
JOE (CONT'D)

there's a rumor in town that
you're out to get Hearst because
they dropped you from L.B.'s
payroll, that they didn't want you
around anymore.

JOE

Hey, you made yourself court
jester.
Mank's still.
JOE (CONT'D)

W.R.'s pet name for Marion's
genitalia... now I know you'd
never stoop to that...

Charlie tells me you're up for
Thalberg's old job.
JOE
Not anymore.

JOE
Don't flatter yourself, Herman. I
did it all alone.
MANK
Now, there's a first!
JOE
I "exposed myself" not entirely
metaphorically in court.
Do tell.

MANK

JOE
Somebody was bitching about Mervyn
LeRoy running over budget on
Wizard of Oz.
MANK
- That goddamn movie again JOE
- And I said, 'LeRoy s'amuse.' I
was then forced to spend the next
twenty minutes having to explain
that 'Le Roy' is 'Le Roi' -luh
r'wah- in French and means the
King. Or to be specific, Francois
the First and his royal habit of
s'amus - ing himself by diddling
all the ladies of his court...
MANK
You know, Pop was right. You
should'a been a professor.
JOE
Nobody knew what the fuck I was
talking about! They say I was
passed over because I'm not a team
player (beginning to break up)
But I know better. It was that
GODDAMN FRENCH PUN THAT DID ME IN!

Shelly lapses into CHUCKLES.

That surprises you? You're the

MANK
Then you deserve better.

MARION
That's very sweet... always wanted

Willie came to the show. Same seat

girls said to watch out, he was too
old for me and too interested.
MANK
Come now, he wasn't your only
admirer...
Marion smiles to herself: "please..."
MARION
The thing you got sooooo right in
your script was how lonely he'd
been as a boy. When my own mother
heard he was one of the richest
men in America...she said, "Kick a
little higher." (after a beat) He
has always been so kind to me...
Mank doesn't say anything.
MARION (CONT'D)
I love the old guy, Mank. Maybe I
didn't always. Back when he was my
"Social Security." But now, there
are things about us -- together -that no one could possibly -(coming out of it)
Am I persuading you at all?
And realizing the depth of her feeling...
MANK
I hope - if this gets made, you'll
forgive me.
And what makes her unforgettable...

WELLES (V.O.)
I understand you're in touch with
your Hollywood crowd?
MANK
Good old Houseman WELLES (V.O.)
- so perhaps you've heard. None of
the theatre chains will touch us.
It looks like RKO will have to sue
for restraint of trade. They'll
countersue, of course. If you own
any part of that lovely home of
yours it might be a good idea to
put it in Poor Sara's name.
MANK expels a smoky SIGH.
WELLES (V.O.)
You still there, Mank?
MANK
Oh yes, where else would I be?
WELLES (V.O.)
I've saved the best for last.
Guess who phoned with an offer to
buy out RKO's investment and
shelve the picture permanently.
MANK
Not Hearst?
WELLES (V.O.)
Mank, I'm surprised. Would Othello
snoop on Desdemona when he has
Iago?

131.
MANK
Ahh Mayer. What did RKO say?
WELLES
No dice - for now. But they're on
their uppers, whether they can
hold out MANK
You'd better drive up.
WELLES (V.O.)
I plan to, just as soon as I'm
doneMANK
Today. If possible.
WELLES (V.O.)
Dear Jove, did I say something I
shouldn't have? I hope you haven't
lost your nerve.
MANK
Nerve's about all I've got left.

SUPERIMPOSE THE
LEGEND:
INT. SAN SIMEON DINING HALL - NIGHT - 1937 (FLASHBACK)
A symphony of noise, a long table is filled with people
dressed absurdly in CIRCUS COSTUMES, eating, drinking, all
talking at once. At the middle of the table, reigning
supreme, are HEARST, MARION. Sitting at Hearst's elbow,
MAYER basks in reflected glory. Without Thalberg he has
flourished.
HEARST
What a year you've had, Louis. How
have you weathered it?
MAYER
Despite everything, the M-G-M
ship, I'm happy to say, is full
steam ahead.

132.
MAYER (CONT'D)
We're on track with this recent
slate -- for our most successful
year ever.
And we hear OFF-STAGE some commotion...
HEARST
Well, that's great news...
A MAN (O.S.)
Would you like to go to a bungalow
and lay down...?
MANK (O.S.)
I think I'd rather stay upright...
A MAN (O.S.)
Perhaps we could find you a
costume...
MANK (O.S.)
Well, why would I need a cos...
Suddenly MANK, a cigarette in one hand, his hat in the
other, as drunk as we've yet seen him, catapults
inside...All heads turn...
MANK (CONT'D)
Hello everyone...Better late than
ever...
Someone asks...
FEMALE PARTY-GOER ONE
Mank. Where's Sara?
Mank, correctively slurring...
MANK
Uh, caring for clan Mankiewicz.
MALE PARTY-GOER ONE
What train did you take?
MANK
Glendale...I- I missed my stop.
Got a taxi from Morro Bay.
MAYER
(to Mank; for the
enjoyment of everyone)

133.
MAYER (CONT'D)
I'm confused, I thought the
invitation called for "circus"
attire, not "flea circus"...?
MANK
I was cornered by a man who sold
vacuum cleaners. A show of hands,
who knows what a vacuum cleaner
is?
HEARST
(overlaps)
Sir The room titters...And as Mank looks to see where he is
meant to sit, we see W.R., very upset, nod his head
imperceptibly to move Mank's plate...
HEARST (CONT'D)
Martin, would you set a place for
Mr. Mankiewicz, somewhere where he
might get some air...
And the Butler, with plate and napkin and silver in hand...
MARTIN
Would you follow me this way,
sir...
Thirty feet away, Martin places his table setting...Another
Server helps Mank to his seat. Mank looks at his unfamiliar
seatmates in their absurd costumes.
HEARST
And offer him some coffee...
MAYER
(to the delight of the
other guests)
Yeah. Mr. Monkeywitz could use
some coffee...
Mank, oblivious, slips from a passing waiter a glass of
wine he's been pouring for nearby guests. Mank's eyes meet
Marion's, but she looks away. The guests all return to
drinking and conversation. And Mank begins to eat his fish,
silently swallowing.

134.
HEARST
And how's Marie Antoinette coming
together?
MAYER
Previews have been a struggle for
general audiences. We made some
trims, but I should've known...
Versailles, all those costumes and
wigs...you can't tell those
stories without overhauling them
for a modern audience...
HEARST
And how's the performance of your
leading lady? The picture depends
upon her.
MAYER
Norma put her heart and soul into
it. I should have insisted she
take some time...It's a lot to
deal with a loss like that...
HEARST
Marion would have made it her own.
MAYER
Marion would have been perfection.
MANK
(mumbling to himself)
Marion Antoinette...Marionette...
MAYER
But it was Irving's picture. It
takes a kind of patience to make
"literary" pictures. I'm not
interested in educating our
customers. You want to send a
message? Call Western Union.
(smiles)
"Let them get cake..." Who needs
to see that?
Mank, prompted to say something, taps his glass with a
cocktail fork...All ignore him...He takes up a hefty soup
spoon and decapitates his glass into a thousand pieces...

135.
MANK'S POV
EVERYONE - in costume a surreal caricature of Old Hollywood
- falls deathly SILENT.
CUT TO:

INT. BUNGALOW - VICTORVILLE (1941) - DAY

76

MANK'S two year-old daughter JOHANNA bounces gaily off his
bedside. RITA and SARA ease up behind them.
RITA
(to the little girl)
Johanna, come along now. I'll show
you those horses we talked about.
She ushers her out, leaving MANK and SARA alone. SARA
saunters around, touching things.
SARA
She's very pretty.
MANK
Also very bright, bull-headed, and
British. Are you here to try your
luck too, Schnutz?
At what?

SARA

MANK
Changing my mind.
SARA
I never had much success with
that, Herman. In the end, you'll
do what you need to.
MANK
Charlie's been here, Joe's been,
Marion's been. For one reason or
another, all of them want me to
walk away. You care to hear what
I've decided?
SARA picks up a knick-knack, examines it, puts it down.

136.
SARA
Not really.
MANK
After twenty years of connubial
bliss, blind loyalty can get a
little suffocating.
SARA
Okay. Here goes. God knows I've
rehearsed it enough...
(faces him)
I've raised your kids kosher and
all but by myself. I've put up
with your suicidal drinking, your
compulsive gambling, your silly
platonic affairs. You owe me,
Herman. So: Joe says he can't
promise but he thinks if you make
nice with Mayer, you can have your
old job back. Is that what you
want me to say? I know what your
answer will be -- so don't ask me
to give you "Poor Sara's" Seal of
Approval.
MANK
(a rueful smile)
Why do you put up with me,
Schnutz? My movie-star looks or my
diplomat's charm?
SARA
I suppose because being married to
you, Herman, I'm never bored.
Exhausted, yes. Exasperated,
usually. But having devoted so
much, I have to stick around to
see how it all turns out. And
whatever you decide... Please be
mindful of those who care about
you most.
(a beat)
I'm going riding. I haven't seen a
horse's face in years...
SARA turns and goes to the door, where she looks back.

137.
SARA (CONT'D)
Oh, and one last thing, Herman.
ALTERNATING CLOSE-UPS OF SARA AND MANK
Who looks at her as if what she will say may save him.
SARA (CONT'D)
(burlesquing her Brooklyn
accent)
I don't want nobody calling me
"Poor Sara" no more.
77

INT. SAN SIMEON - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - CONT'D)
ANGLE ON MANK
As he teeters to his feet and faces the COSTUMED CROWD.
MANK
I've got a great idea for a
picture, Louis...A picture I just
know you're gonna love. It's a
modern-day version of Quixote.
ANGLE ON HEARST AND MARION
HEARST and MARION look at MANK, guarded but attentive.
Following their lead, all of the GUESTS do likewise.
ANGLE ON MANK
MANK (CONT'D)
(swaying)
Now, I know none of you read, but
you know what it's about: a
deluded old nobleman who tilts at
windmills. So how might we update
this story? How about we make our
Quixote a newspaperman! Who else
could make a living tilting at
windmills? But that's not enough -no, he wants more than readership - he wants more than adulation, he
wants love.
MANK teeters, about to fall, then rights himself.

77

138.
MANK (CONT'D)
So he runs for public office and
because he's notably rich, he
wins! No, no, wait a minute.
Notably Rich-and-Powerful can't
win over an audience unless
Notably Rich-and-Powerful sees the
error of his ways in the final
reel. Notably Rich-and-Powerful
and making no goddamn excuses for
it is only admirable in real life.
Isn't that right, Louis? So: What
do we do? Anybody?
MANK begins to move around the table, navigating from one
chair back to another, a spellbinding spieler when he's on.
MANK (CONT'D)
We give him ideals! Ideals that any
dirt-poor, Depression-weary
audience can identify with. Our
Quixote is against crooked trusts.
He's for the eight-hour work day.
Fair income tax. Better schools.
Why, he's even for government
ownership of railroads! And you
know what we call those people?
A VOICE (O.S.)
Communists!
A VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Anarchists!
TENSION-RELEASING LAUGHTER. MANK grins, doesn't join in.
MANK
No. Our Quixote he's a two-fisted
"muckraker." In fact, someone
predicts that he will one day win
the Presidency and bring about -Get this -- a Socialist
revolution!
MAYER
What a bunch of bullshit.
Is it?

MANK

139.
He points at Hearst.
Tell him.

MANK (CONT'D)

ANGLE ON HEARST
As everyone turns to look at him. At this moment HEARST
could pass for an Eskimo bone carving of a leviathan.
MANK (CONT'D)
Tell him! Upton Sinclair used
exactly those words to describe a
young William Randolph Hearst!
A few people, feeling they're witnessing a brutal family
argument, slowly move to stand under the arches. MARION
puts a hand on HEARST'S arm protectively.
MAYER
You miserable bastard!
Louis...

HEARST

MANK
How do you do. Our Quixote, he
hungers, he thirsts, he lusts for
voters to love him -- love him
enough to make him president. But
they won't and they don't.
MANK looks around, as if defying his LISTENERS to dispute.
MANK (CONT'D)
How do you suppose that could
happen? Could it be because in
their hearts they know that he
values power over people?
ANGLE ON HEARST
Who just shakes his head, a human metronome.
MANK (CONT'D)
Disillusioned in Congress he
authors not one single piece of
legislation in two terms!

140.
MANK (CONT'D)
Can you believe that? That'll take
some writing.
Mayer starts to say something angrily to Mank...Hearst puts
his hand on Mayer's shoulder, stopping him as if to say,
"Let him hang himself." MANK is walking again -- he may
pass out should he stop.
MANK (CONT'D)
Placed in nomination for
president, but too radical for the
boys in the back -- His bid goes
nowhere...but we're doing
something, we're building sympathy!
MANK BELCHES again, LOUDLY. His stomach spasms. More people
get up, leaving quietly. Those that are left are the
loyalists, Hearst, Marion and Mayer.
MANK (CONT'D)
Rejected, he flees to Lotus Land,
where his faithful troll, Sancho,
has prepared a mythical kingdom...
Wait a minute -- I've forgotten
the love interest!
MANK is fighting down the heaves now.
MANK (CONT'D)
Her name... Dulcinea.
REACTION SHOT OF MARION
Who is silently spiking her drinking water.
MANK (CONT'D)
Funny -- adventurous -- smarter
than she acts. She's a-- she's a
showgirl, beneath his social
stratum, but that's okay...
because true love on the big
screen, as we all know, is blind.
And she? Yeah, she loves him too!
So, he takes her away to his mmythical kingdom.
(to Martin)
Can I get a bicarb?

141.
One MESMERIZED GUEST goes for his pocket, catches himself.
Mank picks up someone's wine glass and drains its contents.
MANK (CONT'D)
Now, along comes Nemesis. That's
Greek for any guy in a black hat.
Nemesis runs for governor and he's
a shoo-in to win. Why? Because
he's exactly what our Don used to
be. An idealist. You get it? Not
only that, Nemesis is the same guy
who once predicted our Quixote
would one day preside over a
Socialist revolution. Our Quixote
looks into the mirror of his youth
and decides to break this glass, a
maddening reminder of who he once
was. Assisted by his faithful
Sancho, and armed with all the
black magic at his command he does
just this. Destroying in the
process not one man, but two...
Well, what'd'ya think, Louis? Hmm?
You think it'll play?
And on that, MANK pitches forward and vomits...
MANK (CONT'D)
(wiping his mouth)
Don't worry, folks. The white wine
came up with the fish.
A STAFF-MEMBER glides forward to silently supply MANK with a
napkin...MARION glides from the room in tears. The
remaining guests but MAYER rise and float away on an eddy
of strained small talk.
MAYER
Who the fuck do you think you are,
Mankiewicz? You're nuthin' but a
court jester! And lem'me let you in
on a little secret. Do you have
any idea who pays half your
salary? He pays half your fuckin'
salary! (meaning Hearst) Him! You
fuckin' INGRATE!
MANK stares at MAYER, who jabs a finger into his chest.

142.
MAYER (CONT'D)
You didn't know that, did you? You
wanna know why?
MANK cannot bring himself to speak.
MAYER (CONT'D)
Because he likes the way you talk.
Not the way you write. The way you
talk. Don't that chap your ass!

WELLES, in safari suntans, lumbers through the front door.
Houseman, loaded up with papers, follows close behind him.
WELLES
Rise and shine, hombre, Shoot-out
at the OK corral.
(pulling up a chair)
Before we buckle down, I gather
you have something to get off your
chest.
MANK
As a matter of fact, I do.
WELLES
Frankly, I think what I said upset
you. I know your health's not what
it might be. And I understand that
comes first...
Really?

MANK

WELLES
This studio fuss - this lawsuit God only knows what pressure's yet
to come - at your age you'd be
justified in wanting out.
MANK
Uh, I'm forty three, but that's very understanding.

143.
WELLES
Mayer's buy-out was rejected, so
the fat's only starting to hit the
fire. Now, I talked to RKO and
I'll tell you what they're ready
to do. In recognition of the
outstanding work you've done so
far they're prepared to relieve
you of the rewrite and still honor
your full pay. Plus 10,000
dollars. How's that?
MANK
That's more than generous. But, I
don't intend to walk.
WELLES
Alright. What's bothering you,
then?
MANK
You're not going to like this,
Orson. I want credit.
WELLES
Come again?
MANK
It's the best thing I've ever
written.
WELLES
(a deadly pause)
Jack, get me some Cuban cigars.
HOUSEMAN
In Victorville?
WELLES
(his eyes on MANK)
Do what you can, Jack.
MANK
Oh, stay, Houseman. You'll miss
the third-act complicator.
WELLES

Get going, Jack. Muy Pronto.

HOUSEMAN
I believe that means right away.
79

INT. SAN SIMEON - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK - CONT'D)
MANK faces HEARST, motionless in the great, shadowy,
echoing chamber.
HEARST
Mank, Mank...
MANK
What I said - was more in sorrow
than in anger, Willie.
It's dead still. The two men alone in the room. HEARST
crosses to MANK, and putting a fatherly hand on his
shoulder, turns and guides him toward the exit.
HEARST
Are you familiar with the parable
of the organ-grinder's monkey?
Now, the organ-grinder's monkey is
tiny in stature, and having been
taken from the wild, he's
naturally overwhelmed by the
enormous world around him. But
every morning, a sweet elderly
woman dresses him in a fine suit
of clothes. She fits him with a
red velvet vest adorned with pearl
buttons and a handsome red fez
with a silk tassel...she slips on
brocade shoes that curl at the
toe...and he's paired with a fine
gilt music box on an exquisite
gold chain, fastened to his neck,
and his neck alone. Whenever he
ventures into the city to perform
he thinks: what a powerful fellow
I must be. Look how patiently
everyone waits just to watch me
dance.
MANK
(softening blow)
Wha- Willie -

79

145.
Hearst grips Mank's shoulder a touch more.
HEARST
And wherever I go, he
thinks...this music box must
follow - and with it, this poor,
downtrodden man. And if I chose
not to dance, this sorry street
peddler would starve...
As they reach the front door:

HEARST as he eases MANK out.
HEARST
And every time I do decide to
dance - every time - he must play.
Whether he wishes to or not.

You've had a bit too much to
drink, Herman. I'll get Raymond to
drive you to the station. Good bye.

81

INT. BUNGALOW - VICTORVILLE (1941) - DAY (CONT'D)

81

HOUSEMAN has gone. MANK and WELLES face each other across
the coffee table like the wily poker players they are.
WELLES
Put aside gratitude, Mank - That
you've done your best work was no
accident...I removed any
distraction...eliminated every
excuse... your family, your
cronies, liquor... I gave you a
second chance...
MANK
And for that, I cannot thank you
enough.

146.
WELLES
But with credit for a risky
undertaking must go the weight of
real responsibility! Given your
current health, I wonder if you're
up to it?
MANK
And frankly, I wonder, too. But
we'll find out.
WELLES
You may never work in this town
again, Mank!
MANK can only LAUGH.
MANK
Orson, please...
WELLES
Then you force me to remind you:
We have a contract that you
understood and agreed to! If you
fight this, it will go to what
your new guild calls arbitration.
And you, my friend, will lose.
Script... Money...And assuming
such a thing still exists in
Hollywood, the respect of those
who honor their word.
MANK
(beat)
How can I put this nicely? I may
be a loose cannon but you, my
friend, are an outsider -- They're
exasperated by me - and I've
earned it - but, you- a selfanointed Savior Hyphenate? They're
just waiting to loathe you.
WELLES sits in silence.
WELLES
Remind me never again to work with
a washed-up alcoholic.

147.
MANK
Duly noted. Nelson Algren please
copy.
Welles climbs to his feet and begins to stride around, a
boiler about to blow.
WELLES
All right. No doubt you'll get
your credit. But ask yourself:
Who's producing this picture?
Directing it? Starring in it?
Abruptly he stops, his seething gaze caught and fixed on
INSERT - MANK'S LIQUOR CABINET
Almost empty now. Rebuking his entire plan.
ANGLE ON WELLES
As he BELLOWS and seizes the cabinet in both hands, and
with adrenaline-driven rage hoists it over his head and
hurls it CRASHING against the fireplace. Purged, he looks
upon it, his breath jetting forth in hard, rhythmic gasps.
MANK
(quickly jotting a note
to himself)
That's just what we need when
Susan leaves Kane. An act of
purging violence.
Welles slows.
WELLES
(his eyes say: "perfect"
but his lips say)
May - be.
They look at each other. Welles turns on his heel and blows
out the door, leaving it open. We can see the people
outside, some of the hands and help, have stopped, watching
the famous wonder boy who gets into his limo and is driven
off.

EPILOGUE:
Herman Mankiewicz would die 11 years later of complications
from alcoholism. He would never work with Orson Welles nor
write an original screenplay, or fight for screen credit again.
He confided in a friend, "I seem to have become more and
more a rat in a trap of my own construction, a trap I
regularly repair whenever there seems to be danger of an
opening that will enable me to escape".
He was 55.
