FADE IN:
INT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
Jesse and 14-year-old Hank are walking through an airport in
Greece.
JESSE
So you got everything?
Mmm-hmmh.

HANK

JESSE
You going to play video games the
whole flight, or do you think you
might actually crack a book?
HANK
Probably read some.
JESSE
If I write you an email, don't be
scared to write me back, okay? It
won't kill you to let your old man
know what you're thinking about and
what's going on, you know?
Yeah.

HANK

JESSE
If we want, we could try Skyping
once a week or something.
All right...

HANK

JESSE
You got the drawings for your science
deal?
HANK
Yeah, think so.
JESSE
Alright, well they turned out great
by the way. Like, really great.
Thanks.

HANK

They've arrived at the concession stand.
of snacks.

Hank grabs a couple

2.
JESSE
Is your computer charged?
Yeah.

HANK

JESSE
What do you think's the first thing
you're gonna do when you get home?
I dunno.

HANK

JESSE
I really cherish this communication
we have. You know, it's just - your
answers are so...
HANK
(interrupting)
What?
Jesse is paying.
JESSE
Just keep practicing the piano, okay?
You're really good and they spend so
much time at that school of yours...
just remember that music is actually
something you will use in your life.
Right, and don't forget to - you
want those sesame things, right?
They're really good.
Yeah.

HANK

JESSE
Right.
(to cashier)
Yassou. Here you go.
Okay.

Thank you.

He gets the change and they head to the gate.
JESSE (CONT'D)
I'll probably make it over there in
October, you know? Try to see you
in that first recital and then
hopefully catch a soccer game while
I'm there.
(to cashier)
Efharisto.

3.
HANK
I might not even play soccer this
year.
JESSE
Oh, that'd be a big mistake.
me.

Trust

HANK
I'm not that good.
JESSE
Oh, no, you're pretty good.
are.

You

HANK
I mean, I missed summer training
camp, so the chances of me starting
are minuscule.
JESSE
Yeah, well, just tell the coach the
situation - your dad lives in Europe,
you really wanted to be there, blah
blah blah. Blame me. My parents
stink, but I'm really serious.
HANK
But I'm not serious, Dad.
care that much.

I don't

JESSE
Well, you don't have to decide right
now. You know, just think about it.
All I'm saying is that team sports
are important, you know?
They've arrived at the security line.
Here we are.
don't you?

JESSE (CONT'D)
I love this airport,

HANK
It's awesome.
JESSE
I know, it's cool, right?
about seeing your mom?
HANK
Yeah, and all my friends.

You excited

4.
JESSE
Yeah, right. What about your boarding
pass, passport...? Okay. You feel
confident about making the connection?
HANK
Yeah, I've done this before.
JESSE
Yeah, but not with a tricky connection
like this. Just remember, when you
land, you stay in your seat. Somebody
from the airline's going to come get
you and take you to the gate, right?
HANK
It's not a problem.
JESSE
Okay. All right. Oh, boy. Well,
looks like maybe we should just do
this thing, huh? Okay. Come here.
They hug.
JESSE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna do my best to make that
recital, okay?
HANK
You know, I wouldn't bother.
JESSE
What makes you say that?
HANK
Look, I'm not being mean, but it'd
be easier if you didn't come to the
recital.
How come?

JESSE

HANK
It'd just be better if you visited
on another weekend.
JESSE
But... I want to see you play.
HANK
Look, it's because Mom hates you so
much. She'd be really stressed if
you were there, and then it'd be
tense for me.

5.
Jesse motions to the person behind him to go ahead.
HANK (CONT'D)
We wouldn't have any time to hang
out, anyway.
JESSE
Don't worry about her, we'll figure
that out, we can... Just don't want
you to worry about it. You know? I
mean... you know how much I miss
you, right?
Hank nods.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Why do you think she still hates me
so much?
HANK
I don't know. I think she hates
Daniel more than she hates you.
Hank playfully punches Jesse.
HANK (CONT'D)
Hey, don't worry about it. I'll
figure something out. We should
just do this though.
JESSE
Yeah. But I mean, is there anything
I can do to help?
HANK
I don't know.
JESSE
But you know that I love you, right?
Yeah.
Right, okay.

HANK
JESSE

HANK
Yeah, I know. This has been the
best summer of my life.
Really?
Yeah!

JESSE
HANK

6.
JESSE
Well, me too. See, I told you, I
told you this whole Greece thing was
going to be great.
And it was.

HANK

A final moment.
Okay.

JESSE
All right. I love you, pal.

HANK
I love you too, Dad.
JESSE
Okay, shake my hand.
go.
HANK

Bye.
Bye.

All, right,

JESSE
See ya.
(sighs)

He goes into security. Jesse watches him walk away, and
then slowly heads toward the exit.
EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
We follow Jesse back through the airport as he finds his way
to the parking lot, revealing Celine, standing outside of
the car, talking on the phone.
CELINE
(speaking french)
Oui, oui.
(continues in french)
Okay.
As Jesse and Celine settle inside the car, the camera pans
over toward two 6-year-old girls who are asleep in the back
seat. That's right, twins NINA and ELLA. They start driving
away from the airport.
INT. CAR - AFTERNOON
As they hit the highway, Celine lowers her volume as she
wraps up her conversation.

7.
CELINE
(into phone)
Okay. Bon. Tr√®s bien. Merci.
Oui, oui, Lucia. Au'voir.
(hangs up, speaks
french)
JESSE
What's going on?
CELINE
They voted against it.
JESSE
What, the wind turbines?
CELINE
Six months dealing with those people,
they were all for it. Everyone agreed
it was great for the region...
Oh.

JESSE
So what happened?

CELINE
...And now they've decided that they
don't like the way it looks on that
hill. It's ruining their view.
JESSE
No, no, I thought it was a done deal.
It was!

CELINE
It practically was--

Well, can--

JESSE

CELINE
That's what's so infuriating.
JESSE
Can they do that?
CELINE
Yes, of course. They've done it.
That's it. It's over, fini.
I'm sorry.

JESSE

CELINE
No, no, it's just so frustrating.
can't take it anymore.
(MORE)

I

8.
CELINE (CONT'D)
(beat)
I'm gonna take that job with Remy.
JESSE
No. No, you don't want to work for
him.
Why not?

CELINE

JESSE
For the government?
CELINE
Well, I think this government is
different. We need laws. That's
the only way anything is going to
happen.
JESSE
It's not the only way. You guys
have been getting a lot of good work
done.
CELINE
Well, I've been thinking about it.
This is the way to go.
JESSE
Okay. Well then, let me remind you
that you do not like that guy. The
whole time you worked for him before,
you complained about him constantly.
CELINE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He can be an
asshole, but he gets things done.
That's how I'm gonna be from now on-Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
A real bitch, okay?

That's it.

JESSE
Okay. Well every time I look at
that guy, all I see is ambition. I
mean, I'm sorry, I just don't trust
him. The only reason he's going
from non-profit to government is to
have people kiss his ass.

9.
CELINE
I don't care about him, okay?
JESSE
All right, and I think you're gonna
be miserable, all right? Just with
all that politicking and compromising-CELINE
Whatever. I've made my decision.
I'm tired of being the do-gooder
that rolls a boulder up a hill and
watches it roll down again.
JESSE
Isn't he the guy that used to throw
his pens at his assistant and stuff?
CELINE
Okay, I should have taken this job a
year ago. You know, and I was scared
because of the amount of work, but I
think it's the best opportunity ever
and it's more money and... I'm doing
it.
Okay.

JESSE
Are you sure?

CELINE
No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
JESSE
All right, all right-CELINE
I mean, you know, what's gonna happen
to everyone if I leave? Like
Francoise, and I mean, they count on
me. What do you think? Should I
take it or not, should... Should I?
JESSE
Ah, no, no, no, I don't have an
opinion. I just don't want to see
you rush into a decision because of
this wind turbine crap.
CELINE
No! It's not just that, okay? It's
been stirring in me all summer...
JESSE
Well, I know it has.

I know.

10.
CELINE
...And I should do it.
it!

And I'm doing

JESSE
All right then, just - then do it.
CELINE
I'm doing it, all right? Oh, god.
I wish things were simpler. I mean,
if I leave I get fucked, if I stay I
get fucked...
JESSE
(laughs)
There's always a catch.
CELINE
Yeah, the world is fucked.
Yeah, baby.

JESSE

CELINE
Oh, god. We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for the first
two weeks.
JESSE
Or the perfect son who lives a million
miles away.
CELINE
Or the love of your life can't clean
up after himself or learn how to
shave.
JESSE
Who's that? You're not, you're not
talking about Captain Clean-up over
here, are you? You don't mean-CELINE
Captain Clean-up! The one that's
been missing in action all these
years!
JESSE
What did you expect at this point in
your life, missy?
Celine turns back to look at the twins.

11.
CELINE
God! Oh, look at them; they're so
cute! They look like conjoined twins!
Oh my god, I gotta take a picture.
She takes out her cell phone and takes a picture.
reaches back for something he can't quite find.

Jesse

JESSE
Hey, did uh, did Ella finish that
apple?
CELINE
You're going to take food out of
your child's mouth?
JESSE

Yeah.

Celine reaches back and grabs a half-eaten apple off the
seat.
Okay.

Well.

CELINE
It's all brown.

JESSE
Oh, there's a spot here.
He takes a bite from the green part of the apple.
now filming him with the camera.
CELINE
Ella - this is evidence of your father
stealing food from you. If you become
bulimic or anorexic, it is not my
fault. Don't blame it all on your
mother, okay?
JESSE
Ella, this is a family apple. I'm
teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you honey.
CELINE
Ohh, so sweet. You girls will
remember this vacation very
differently than we will.
JESSE
That's for sure. I see that with my
mom. She remembers my childhood
entirely differently than I do. Can
you please stop filming me.
Celine puts the phone away.

Celine is

12.
CELINE
God. I love your mom.
so hard on her.

You're always

JESSE
It's because you missed the fucked
up years. You're just getting the
good era.
CELINE
The "fucked up years." That reminds
me, talking about fucked up... did I
ever tell you the story of my little
Cleopatra kitty? No? Okay, I think
you would remember if I did. When I
was a little girl I had this cat
named Cleopatra and every spring she
would jump the fence and get pregnant
and always end up with a litter of
exactly two kittens.
Two kitties?

JESSE

CELINE
Two kitties. Every time, every year,
two cats. I mean it was just...
amazing. Then one day, I was around
30 and I was having lunch with my
Dad, I was remembering, mentioning
little Cleopatra and he was like 'the hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens'and I was like WHAT? It turns out-listen to this--there were sometimes
up to 7 kittens in that litter-Oh, no.

JESSE

CELINE
But he would take five of them-Oh, no.

JESSE

CELINE
--Put them into a plastic bag with a
bunch of ether.
JESSE
(laughs)
That's terrible.

13.
CELINE
He had forgotten the lie he and my
mom had told me as a kid.
JESSE
How did he decide which ones he wanted
to kill?
CELINE
Well, I actually asked him that.
Did you take the fluffiest, cutest?
He just started to cry.
Oh.
Poor Daddy.

JESSE
CELINE

They realize they're driving by some ancient ruins.
CELINE (CONT'D)
Oh, we said we were going to stop.
They wanted to see the ruins.
JESSE
Yeah, but should we?
CELINE
Well, Ella really wanted to.
JESSE
Yeah, but should we wake them up?
CELINE
I don't know.
JESSE
You know what, let's do this. On
our way back to the airport we can
catch them.
CELINE
You know we won't.
JESSE
Yeah, probably not.
Okay.

CELINE

JESSE
We'll be like, so long, ancient ruins!
What's so great about you anyway?

14.
CELINE
Psh! Seen one, seen them all!
my god, we are shitty parents.
should have stopped.

Oh
We

JESSE
Aw, it's okay.
CELINE
It's culture. Come on, go back.
JESSE
Ah, we gotta put some character in
these kids somehow, you know what I
mean?
Yeah, yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
We're teaching them a valuable lesson,
you know. You snooze, you lose in
this world.
CELINE
And when the girls are in rehab,
recovering from ten years of addiction
to coke and speed, they'll say, "oh,
we just never felt comfortable going
to sleep because our daddy always
used to tell us, "you snooze, you
lose." And that'll be your fault
again.
JESSE
(laughing)
Okay, okay. Well, we are shitty
parents.
I know.

CELINE

JESSE
Saying goodbye to Hank sucked.
CELINE
Why, was he upset?
JESSE
No, no. He said it was the best
summer of his life.
CELINE
Well, that's great!
(MORE)

15.
CELINE (CONT'D)
I mean, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. We spoke a bunch, and
you know what his main concerns in
life are?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Pimples and how girls perceive him.
The apple doesn't fall far from the
tree, I guess.
JESSE
What do you mean? I'm not like that.
Oh, please!
What?

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
That's all you think about!
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Women! I mean--I'm not complaining.
I'm getting a lot of attention. But
you never stop ogling girls.
JESSE
I don't ogle girls.
Yeah you do.

CELINE

JESSE
I don't ogle girls!
(sexy Spanish accent)
I make love to them with my eyes.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
I like the Spanish guy.
Greek?

Or is it

16.
JESSE
(Spanish accent)
I don't know where I'm from, but I'm
very hairy.
CELINE
(laughs)
Well, I think... You know, Henry
might have, you know.
What?

JESSE

CELINE
That little Melina girl.
JESSE
I don't know. He had a crush but...
CELINE
Oh, are you kidding?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Why do you think he said it was the
best summer of his life?
JESSE
Because he and I had a good time
together?
Jesse...

CELINE

JESSE
No, huh? So what, you think they...
you think they what-Of course.

CELINE

JESSE
You think they kissed?
CELINE
Yeah, they kissed! Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I was sworn to secrecy but he
told me. They kissed. Okay.
JESSE
What'd he say?

17.
CELINE
I'm not supposed to tell you anything,
so I'm not gonna talk but-Come on.

JESSE

CELINE
Okay. He told me he was worried you know, concerned about the kissing.
You know, tongue, no tongue.
JESSE
What, he asked you that?
CELINE
Yeah. But he was so - he was so
cute. All nervous, all red, biting
his cheek like when he was little.
So cute.
JESSE
Wow. So he and Melina were a real
thing.
Yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
What's gonna happen now?
CELINE
I don't know. They must be friends
on Facebook, so they'll keep in touch,
at least for a while.
JESSE
Hey - what if they end up spending
their whole life together? You know?
CELINE
You're so corny! Sometimes I'm just
like JESSE
No, I just - I mean CELINE
What are you, a twelve-year-old girl?
JESSE
I'm just, it's -

18.
CELINE
I mean, first love, do you even
remember who it was?
JESSE
Uh, yeah, I do. It was you.
CELINE
Oh, please. Like you were a virgin
at twenty-three. I don't JESSE
No, you said "first love", not first
sexual experience, okay?
CELINE
Okay. Fine. Like I'm the first
woman you ever fell in love with?
JESSE
Yeah. Pretty much. The first one I
felt truly connected to. Sure.
CELINE
I don't think so.
JESSE
What, I wasn't your first love?
CELINE
(beat)
No, of course not.
Oh.

JESSE
No, I just - I thought I was.
CELINE

No!

(laughs)
Jesse, stop this.

It's dumb.

JESSE
It's okay, it's okay.
big deal.
No?
on!

Okay.

It's not a

CELINE
How old are you?

Come

JESSE
I'm forty-one and I have loved only
you.
A beat of silence, then they both laugh.

19.
CELINE
You are so, so working on our little
night, aren't you?
JESSE
Hell yeah. I've got a Trojan in my
billfold and a rocket in my pocket.
CELINE
I'm stuck with an American teenager.
Can't believe it. Do we have to do
all that stuff later?
JESSE
What? Oh, yeah, come on. It means
a lot to Patrick. Ariadni and
Stefanos are probably already there
prepping, the kids wanna have one
more big time together - it's gonna
be fun.
CELINE
No, no, no, but I meant the hotel,
later. I just, I'm not sure I want
to go Her phone rings.

She picks it up.

CELINE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hi, sweetie. Yeah. Oh, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Well, well, it's fine.
It's fine! Call me from London.
Have a good flight. Bye.
Jesse gestures for the phone, but she's already hung up.
But - but -

JESSE

CELINE
They were telling them to turn
everything off, they were about to
take off and I asked him to call me
from the plane; you know, I don't
like when he flies.
(a beat)
What?
JESSE
I don't - I dunno. I dunno.
(sighs)
I just don't think I can keep doing
this.

*

20.
CELINE

Why?

JESSE
Just every summer, every Christmas,
you know, it's like I know.

CELINE
It makes me ill every time.

JESSE
It just wouldn't be so bad you know
if I - like if we were sending him
to boarding school or something.
Just - I dunno. ...If his mom and I
got along a little bit better.
CELINE
I know. It's like we're sending him
back across enemy lines.
JESSE
I know. It really hit me this time,
you know? I mean, he's going to be
a freshman in high school! Four
more years and then he's gonna be on
his own.
CELINE
Well, maybe that's the good news.
We only have four more years of this.
JESSE
No, no, no. This is the crucial
time. I just feel like I should be
there for him. Like it's now or
never, you know?
No.

CELINE
What do you mean?

JESSE
I guess I just thought somehow he'd
end up living with us. Somewhere
along the way, you know. Now time's
going by so fast and here we are!
It's high school, you know. There's
girls... next thing you know it's
college applications.
CELINE
Yeah, you're right! Maybe it's time.
I mean... I really think it's time.
(MORE)

21.
CELINE (CONT'D)
Just tell his mum all this and ask
if he can come and live with us.
He'd love it, we can put him in that
bilingual JESSE
That's never gonna happen, all right?
She's never gonna give me one thing
that she's not legally obligated to.
CELINE
Do you want to call that lawyer again?
JESSE
No. I don't like that guy.
terrible.

He's

CELINE
Should I call his mother?
Uh, no.

JESSE
Please. Never again.

No, I know.

CELINE

JESSE
Look, he doesn't even know how to
throw a baseball.
Who cares?

CELINE

JESSE
He just... he leads with his elbow.
He throws like a girl.
CELINE
That's not your fault.
JESSE
No, it is my fault. A father is
supposed to teach you that.
CELINE
Okay, he just doesn't like baseball
does he? Who can blame him.
JESSE
No, it's an example, okay? It's a
metaphor for everything. He's turning
fourteen and he needs his father.

22.
CELINE
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.
JESSE
Well, did I ask you to?
Celine rolls her eyes.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Where'd that come from, huh? I'm
just thinking out loud. I mean,
this is the one thing I promised
myself I would never do and I look
up and I'm doing it.
CELINE
Well... listen, you're a wonderful
father. He loves the relationship
you have, he loves the letters you
send him and he JESSE
He doesn't even read the letters
that I send.
CELINE
No, of course he reads them; he just
doesn't compliment the writing the
way you want.
JESSE
I just know that if I miss these
years, they are never coming back.
Oh, my god.
What?

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
This is where it ends.
JESSE
What're you talking about?
CELINE
This is how people start breaking
up.
JESSE
Oh, my god. What'd you just... you
just jumped off a cliff.

23.
CELINE
No, no. I'm marking this. This is
the day you light the ticking bomb
that will destroy our lives.
Jesse laughs.
Yeah.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Watch.

JESSE
Okay. Well, first off, you don't
light a ticking bomb, okay, you set
it and it's a timer CELINE
Oh, okay, whatever!

Whatever, okay.

JESSE
- That's why it ticks.
CELINE
It has a timer. Well, you know what?
It's ticking. Right now. And this
is how it happens.
Right.

JESSE

CELINE
You're unhappy, you blame it on the
other person, resentment grows,
everything slowly rots and you break
up. That's it.
JESSE
You're just doing this to shut me
up.
Not at all.

CELINE
Not at all!

JESSE
I know you are. That's what you're
doing. Yeah.
CELINE
No-no-no-no. I'm actually surprised
we lasted this long.
Okay, Okay.
hyperbole-

JESSE
So here comes the

24.
CELINE
We were on parallel tracks for a
while but now our tracks have crossed
and I'm going west and you're going
east. And believe me, this is how
it happens. I've seen it, okay?
Catherine Alexander JESSE
You're kidding, right?
kidding.

You're

Well, no! I'm kidding.
not. All right?

Just - this is it.

And I'm

groggily says:

One of the girls, ELLA,

ELLA
How much longer to the ruins?
CELINE
Oh, they were closed.
JESSE
Yeah. Sweetie, you know what we
decided, we're gonna catch them on
the way back, when we're going to
the airport.
Exactly.

CELINE
JESSE

Okay?

CELINE
We'll leave early, right?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

JESSE

ELLA
What happened to my apple?
CELINE
Your apple. La pomme, elle etait
fini, cette pomme. Right?

25.
EXT. FISHING VILLAGE STORE - AFTERNOON
They pull up at a small store in a coastal fishing village
and start getting out of the car. Celine is speaking in
French to the girls.
CELINE
Give me the list.
JESSE
I don't have it.
CELINE
It's in your wallet.
Oh.

JESSE

CELINE
In your wallet.
Okay.

JESSE

He gets out his wallet and hands it to Celine.
out the list instantly.
Voil√†!

CELINE

She turns to the girls.
CELINE (CONT'D)
Okay, I'm the General! Captain Nina,
(tells her what to do
in french)
Oui!

NINA

JESSE
Who made you General?
CELINE
The General, okay?
Oh.

JESSE

CELINE
Captain Ella,

in french)

She pulls

ELLA

Oui!

CELINE
Private Clean-Up, you don't touch
anything.
Oui.

JESSE
D‚Äôaccord.

EXT. ARRIVAL HOME - AFTERNOON
The car pulls up outside an estate by the shore.
out and the girls sprint through the entryway.

They get

EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
On the patio outside the house, a soccer game is going on
with Jesse and many other participants.
EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
At a wonderful seating area, PATRICK listens to a story
NATALIA is telling him.
EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
In a small garden, Celine, Nina and Ella pick vegetables.
Celine has a nice moment where she's just looking at her
little girls in nature, engaged with the earth.
The red one.
Cela?

CELINE
ELLA

CELINE
Tr√®s bien... Okay. Pepper.
EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Jesse, PATRICK, and STEFANOS are relaxing at the far end of
the patio where there's a beautiful ocean view.
STEFANOS
I actually read them both. The first
one is called THAT TIME, the second
one is called THIS TIME.
JESSE
The first one is THIS TIME, the second
one is THAT TIME.

27.
Yeah.

STEFANOS

JESSE
We've got a joke in our family that
"This" brought us back together and
"That" paid for our apartment.
Okay.

PATRICK

STEFANOS
Well, it must be a little weird for
Celine, man, the way she's in a book
like that, no?
Why?
it.

JESSE
I think she's gotten used to

STEFANOS
But the second one is sexy, man.
When he misses the plane and they
black out the windows and they have
sex for days and days and days like
there's no tomorrow. I mean wow,
did you guys actually do that?
Jesse shrugs his shoulders.
STEFANOS (CONT'D)
You did that, uh?
PATRICK
Have you read Jesse's third book?
It's actually better than the first
two.
JESSE
It certainly took longer to write
than the first two put together.
STEFANOS
No, the third one I didn't read. I
mean, my wife gave it to me but it's
just a little bit too long for me,
man. Even the title is long. What's
the title?
JESSE
"Temporary Cast Members of a Long
Running But Little Seen Production
of a Play Called Fleeting."

28.
STEFANOS
Well, exactly my point.
JESSE
Ah, well, you're not alone. Everybody
else thought it was too long.
PATRICK
It's a better book. It's so much
more ambitious.
(in Greek)
The first two were so so.
STEFANOS
(speaks Greek)
Really? Do you think?
What's that?

JESSE

STEFANOS
No, he says he likes all the books.
He does..
Jesse laughs.
INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
Natalia, Ariadni, and Celine are sitting at a table in the
kitchen, chopping vegetables.
CELINE
I mean, I love it here. This place
is amazing. These tomatoes are so
amazing. I can... I can smell them!
They smell so good.
ARIADNI
Yeah, Patrick is very proud of them.
CELINE
I know it's stupid but when we were
about to leave Paris I was a little
nervous to come here. And now that
we're about to leave, I don't want
to go.
NATALIA
Why were you nervous?
ARIADNI
Yeah, why was that?

29.
CELINE
I don't know. This place is so full
of thousands of years of myth and
tragedy and I thought something tragic
was going to happen.
NATALIA
What, you thought the Minotaur was
going to eat your children or
something?
Yes.

CELINE
Exactly.

All three women laugh.
EXT. PATIO - AFTERNOON
Back with the guys...
JESSE
All right, well, the whole time I've
been here, I've been working on this
idea about a group of different people
with all these brain abnormalities.
So the book would be like a day in
their life from all their unique
points of view, right? Like there's
this older lady who has a condition
that makes you feel like you're in a
perpetual state of d√©j√† vu. Every
single experience she has, she feels
like she's had it before. I mean
she can be sitting here with us,
talking seemingly functional right?
And in her head, she's thinking:
Didn't he already say that? I mean;
weren't we here yesterday having
this exact same conversation.
STEFANOS
So just like Deja Vu.
JESSE
Yeah, except all the time.
Ah.

STEFANOS

JESSE
Right, that's the thing, right?
Everything she takes in. Breakfast,
a newspaper, a movie. She's convinced
she's encountered it already.

30.
STEFANOS
So that's a real condition?
JESSE
Yeah. It's called persistent deja...
It's real but I can't pronounce it.
The men chuckle.
JESSE
Then there's these two other
characters with facial recognition
extremes. Like there's this one guy
and he can't recognize his wife of
twenty years. He looks at himself
in the mirror and he feels this
disconnect with that man he's looking
at. Then the other character is the
opposite, middle-aged housewife with
a categorical exacting memory of
every face she's ever seen; so she
lives in a big city but to her, it's
a small town. Like, a taxi drives
past and she thinks 'Oh, that's the
driver who dropped me off at Place
de Vosges three Christmases ago.'
And some old lady walking on the
street, she thinks; 'Oh, she sat two
seats down from me on the Metro last
year.' So, everyone she meets,to
her feels intimate and connected.
STEFANOS
Well, I'm just like the first guy.
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time, man.
We see Patrick's grandson, Achilles, and girlfriend, Anna,
come walking by, just from the beach. Anna slaps his butt
playfully before heading indoors while Achilles joins the
guys.
JESSE
Oh, Achilles! Anna!

Hey, you guys.

PATRICK
Hey, look at this kid. He's having
the best summer of us all.
ACHILLES
Hello, Pappou.
STEFANOS
So you were saying... there's three
characters, right?

31.
JESSE
No, it's not just three characters,
it's a whole group of people. It's
like, I'm working on a chapter right
now about a young Greek man named
Achilles.
Me?

ACHILLES

JESSE
Well, he's named after you. And
this guy is caught in a loop where
all he sees is the transient nature
of everything, right? Like he looks
out to sea and thinks of the day
it's gonna be dry and littered with
fossils.
STEFANOS
Well... I dunno. It sounds a little
pretentious to me.
JESSE
Ah, no-no-no. It won't be
pretentious, I promise. No, it's
gonna be funny. Really funny. He
picks up a book and he immediately
wonders: Who's gonna be the last
person to read this?
STEFANOS
And that‚Äôs funny?
All laugh.
ACHILLES
Sometimes I kind of think like that.
STEFANOS
Well, okay, so he doesn't get excited
about tits, cars, booze, nothing.
He just thinks about death.
JESSE
Well, not so much death, right?
It's just like transformation, you
know. Like he's seeing too far into
the future.
Okay.

STEFANOS

32.
PATRICK
I like this idea for a novel. But
you should add a character of an old
man like me - a poor sap who can't
remember what he had for breakfast,
but he can still hear the song that
was playing when Sheila Campbell
danced topless on the bar at Jury's
when he was 14 years old.
JESSE
That'll work.
STEFANOS
Okay. You have these people lost in
time, right ok? But what's the
connection? Are they going to have
sex? Don't you need something like
that?
JESSE
It's not time that they're lost in,
right? It's like perception. That's
the deal. No, I'm thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie. Like,
every character in some way comes in
contact with the film 'On the
Waterfront.'
(to Achilles)
Have you seen "On the Waterfront"?
He's not sure until Stefanos tells him the Greek title.
ACHILLES
Oh, with Brando!
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

JESSE
ACHILLES

JESSE
Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, the first
chapter of the book is opening
weekend, Times Square, 1954. That
old lady, with perpetual deja vu
walks into the matinee screening,
right? Except the whole time she's
thinking: haven't I already seen
this?
Yeah.

STEFANOS

33.
JESSE
Right. And then another chapter is
a 1979 Paris film studies class.
Then we have a Kazan retrospective
in Munich, 1993.
STEFANOS
Well, man, that is time.
that not time?

How is

JESSE
Yeah, it's time but, it's more
perception. You don't like it.
STEFANOS
I think it's going to be too long.
They laugh.
PATRICK
Well, I like it. Don't listen to
him - he makes bicycles. Send it to
me in galleys.
Will do.

JESSE

EXT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
All five kids are playing a game together somewhere on the
property.
INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
Ariadni, Stefanos, and Celine are in the kitchen, preparing
the meal.
CELINE
In France we stuff the tomatoes with
tomatoes and the peppers with peppers.
ARIADNI
Oh, really? Because we use the same
stuffing for both, because of the
way it reacts differently, in terms
of taste. Oh, and Celine, make sure
you don't stuff them too much because
of the way it overflows in the oven
later and gets kind of nasty.
CELINE
Okay okay, yeah.
STEFANOS
You're doing fine, Celine.

34.
ARIADNI
And especially don't listen to
Stefanos here because he's never
made this dish before, or any other
dish for that matter.
He takes her knife.
CELINE
(Laughing)
Okay.
STEFANOS
You know, I mean...
ARIADNI AND STEFANOS
(Yelling, Speaking
Greek)
STEFANOS
Let go of me,
(Greek)
Let go of me!
ARIADNI
(in Greek)
Stefanos, why are you taking my knife?
Stop stealing people's knives. Here
is a knife perfectly good for what
you're doing.
STEFANOS
(in Greek)
Sweetie, I cannot cut with this little
fucking knife.
CELINE
Are you guys fighting, with knives?
Okay, stop it! Stop fighting with
knives.
ARIADNI
We're not fighting. We're
negotiating.
Anna enters the kitchen and goes over to the refrigerator.
CELINE
Okay, negotiating, that's what you
call it? Wow,
(in French)
Negotiating with knives.

35.
ARIADNI
(in French)
Exactly.
CELINE
(In French)
Not bad.
STEFANOS
This is a system that we have.
CELINE
Wow, so you found a system that works
for you.
Mm-hm.

ARIADNI

CELINE
I thought it was called a
relationship. But I like "system",
that's pretty good. That's ready,
right?
Ariadni walks over and takes a drag off his cigarette.
STEFANOS
That's ready.
Celine takes a platter of appetizers and begins to leave.
CELINE
(to Anna, in French)
And you, what's your system?
Anna gestures oral sex.
CELINE (CONT'D)
(in French)
What about this system?
Celine puts her tongue between her fingers by her lips.
ANNA
(in French)
Not bad.
Celine exits.
STEFANOS
We used to have that system.
Anna laughs.

36.
EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
Jesse leads the kids down the rock steps to the little patch
of rocky beach under Patrick's house.
JESSE
Not too far, you guys!
We catch a nice moment where Jesse is looking out at the
sea, and at the kids, soaking it all up. He checks a text
and the moment is gone.
EXT. DINNER TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON
Now in the middle of their dinner, Jesse taps his wine glass
and gets everyone's attention.
JESSE
All right, I don't want to let this
meal go by without saying thank you
to everyone. And especially you,
Patrick. We had no idea what we
were getting into these last six
weeks. A letter arrives from the
university, inviting us to the
Southern Peloponnese of Greece, to
the guest house of a great writer?
'Sure, why not?' And then at the
airport earlier today, Hank turns to
me and he says this has been the
greatest summer of his life.
GROUP
(Reacting)
JESSE
And I have to say the same. So,
thank you Patrick, and not just for
what you have done for me and my
family but for all the ways you've
given back, all right. So, to
Patrick!
OTHERS
To Patrick...
Glasses clink.
PATRICK
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, when I first saw you at
the airport I thought, 'No way a man
dressed like that could be a man of
letters.'

37.
GROUP
(Laughing)
PATRICK
But now, now I think I've learned
your secret. We've had many great
writers here over the past decade
but never one who had a partner more
interesting than themselves.
GROUP
(Reacting)
Ohh. Oh.
(Laughing)
CELINE
I keep telling you.
PATRICK
And Celine, it's been so great to
have you and your daughters' wonderful
vitality around here, and I'm so
happy you've been able to meet my
dear friend, Natalia, who's husband
Elias was like a brother to me.
CELINE
(to Patrick)
I'm so sorry about the curtains.
Don't worry.

PATRICK
It's nothing.

JESSE
I know. I shouldn't have thrown
those cherriesCELINE
No, I mean, really JESSE
It was my fault.
No, no.

PATRICK/CELINE
That's sweet of you.

ACHILLES
And Grandpa, thanks for including
Anna and me this summer... because
you know he usually puts me to work
but when I bring Anna he lets me sit
at the table of the grown-ups.

38.
JESSE
Welcome to the grownups table!
hear!

Hear

CELINE
(to Anna)
How long have you two been together?
ANNA
Since last summer.
ACHILLES
We met one year ago in my last few
days here with grandpa before I had
to go back to Athens.
ANNA
Yeah, we met at my closing night
cast party. I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros...
JESSE
So, who did you play?
ANNA
I was Perdita in "A Winter's Tale".
STEFANOS
And she was fantastic! Remember,
Patrick, we went to that?
PATRICK
Ahhh Perdita... "When you do dance,
I wish you a wave of the sea, that
you might ever do nothing but that."
GROUP
(Reacting, Applauding)
Bravo!
STEFANOS
The way he just performed that was
much better than the guy at the play!
ACHILLES
Actually, people are still talking
about that production.
ANNA
Yeah but... the after party was even
better. It's where we met.
ACHILLES
I had an old BSA motorcycle.

39.
JESSE

Nice.

ACHILLES
Yeah. We drove around all night.
And then I had to drive her back to
the theater to get her stuff. And
it was dawn.
ANNA
I'll never forget it. It's outdoors
and seats 12,000 people, but it was
now completely empty.
ACHILLES
Yeah. And she was sitting way up in
the back row. So, I went up on stage
and whispered to her...
ANNA
Yeah, the acoustics there are
incredible. I could see his mouth
move and then, three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.
JESSE
(to Anna, quietly)
What'd he say?
Anna just smiles, not saying.
Woah!

Okay!

JESSE (CONT'D)

ARIADNI
(Laughing)
That's private.
ACHILLES
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.
CELINE
How did you keep in touch?
ACHILLES
We Skyped. Pretty much everyday
since then.
ANNA
Yeah, and when we're apart we have a
thing of putting our laptops by the
pillow and falling asleep together.

40.
CELINE
Ah, that's the new romance!
ACHILLES
And when I wake up the screen is
usually frozen... and Anna's face is
in some funny position like...
(Mimes)
STEFANOS
Okay. Can I ask you a question?
Please?
ANNA

Yes.

STEFANOS
When you guys Skype, do you, you
know, do you go a little crazy?
ARIADNI
God, you're being so vulgar!
STEFANOS
No, I'm not being vulgar. I'm just
being an amateur anthropologist who
is interested in virtual words, on a
theoretical level.
ARIADNI
So now you're an anthropologist?
STEFANOS
Yeah. For instance, the sex of the
near future, okay, and I'm not making
this up but, it's gonna be just like
plugging in, attaching something to
your genitals - I'm sorry - and then
you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice. You
will be able to program in all your
preferences. You'll be able to type
in exactly what you want Marilyn
Monroe to whisper in your ear.

Hm..

GROUP
(Reacting)

CELINE
Oh, I might like that.
Come on.

JESSE

41.
ACHILLES
I mean, why not? I mean, more and
more of our experiences are going to
take place in the virtual world.
ANNA
Yeah... And you are a writer, how
are you going to feel when a computer
can write a book better than "War
and Peace"?
PATRICK
It'll never happen.
ACHILLES
I think it's only a question about
WHEN it's going to happen, grandpa.
JESSE
You know, I think I'm probably gonna
feel about the same way as Kasparov you remember how all those chess
players felt when they could no longer
compete with that big-ass computer STEFANOS
The Big Blue.
JESSE
Right, right, right! Remember at
first nobody thought a computer could
ever beat our best.
Right.

STEFANOS

JESSE
(Accent)
A machine lacks that ineffable human
instinct.
GROUP
(Laughing)
JESSE
And now we can't even compete.
CELINE
I saw this documentary where they
were doing an experiment on a lab
rat and he was wired up and he could
push a switch and have an orgasm.
(Laughs)

GROUP

42.
CELINE
And so scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little
creature while it ignored its food
and water and didn't do anything
else, and eventually it just died.
I mean, I think that's the future of
humanity. You know, just
(Demonstrates Rat
Dying)
... And die.
GROUP
(Laughing)
PATRICK
Well, maybe so but every generation
believes that they're witnessing the
end of the world but... I feel that
I'm actually living it.
JESSE
Okay. All right, I have a question
for you Patrick. I think a lot of
people are feeling that way. You
know, that we're this kind of pleasure
obsessed, porn-addled materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology...
At the same moment that computers
are becoming sentient, right? So
what my question is: what is this
notion of self to begin with?
PATRICK
It's written over the portals to the
Temple of Apollo at Delphi: It says
"Gnothi seauton", which means "Know
Thyself".
JESSE
Yeah, but we're kind of 99% automated
already. Our personality - or this
thing we think of as ourself right it's just a tiny fraction of what
the brain is doing, right?
Yeah.

STEFANOS

JESSE
Most of it's just automated body
function.
Okay.

CELINE

43.
JESSE
So then what is it we're actually
ceding?
CELINE
(Interrupting)
If this notion of self is such a
small percentage of you, sweetie...
JESSE

Yes.

CELINE
How come I always hear so much about
it?
(Laughs)

GROUP

STEFANOS
Well, it's just like my penis. I
mean, it's not that big, it's a small
part of myself, but it needs a lot
of attention.
CELINE

His too!

ANNA
And how did you two meet?
ARIADNI
You don't know?
ANNA

What?

STEFANOS
Well, you have to read Jesse's books.
CELINE
Yeah, especially if you want to know
exactly what it's like to have sex
with me, read away.
Read away!

STEFANOS

CELINE
Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.
No, no.

STEFANOS
I mean it's well written.

44.
JESSE
Thank you. We met about 18 years
ago. We kinda, sort of, fell in
love a little bit, and then we lost
track of each other and a decade
later we ran into each other.
CELINE
No, no, no, we didn't run into each
other, sweetie-pie.
We didn't?

JESSE

CELINE
No. You wrote a book "inspired" by
our meeting...
JESSE
Yeah, yeah...
CELINE
And I read about it and went to look
for it.
ANNA
That's pretty romantic.
JESSE
It was really romantic.
CELINE
Not really. Not really. He neglects
to mention he was married, had a
kid...
JESSE
Details, details...
CELINE
Yeah, that part was a disaster.
JESSE
It wasn't a disaster.
inevitable.

It was

CELINE
Yeah. Okay. And the first time we
have sex without a condom, twins!
JESSE
Yeah, one pitch, one homerun.

Boom!

45.
CELINE
And I've been chained to the sink
ever since! I'm sorry to say that,
but ANNA
It's not that bad, is it?
are so beautiful.
Thank you.

The girls

JESSE

CELINE
They're cute.
GROUP
(Laughs, Reacts)
CELINE
Okay, no no, it has some upsides.
Let me tell you right now, Anna, how
to keep a man.
Anna nods.
CELINE (CONT'D)
You've gotta let them win at all the
silly little games...
Oh, okay.

JESSE

CELINE
... They like. When I met Jesse,
the first night we were playing
pinball, and of course I was
winning...
JESSE
Is the foundation to our entire
relationship a lie? It is. It is.
CELINE
... And at the last minute I let the
ball go down the middle. It builds
their confidence.
JESSE
No, she can't beat me at one game,
not any game.
CELINE
If I didn't let him win at every
game... we would never have sex.
(MORE)

46.
CELINE (CONT'D)
I mean, I'm sorry to say it, but
he's actually a closet macho. He
dreams of having a bimbo for a wife.
(Laughs)
Dreams!

GROUP
CELINE

JESSE
It's my greatest aspiration.
that's it.

A bimbo,

Celine changes her demeanor and voice, playing really dumb.
STEFANOS

Whoa!

CELINE
(Baby voice)
So...
Uh-oh.

STEFANOS
JESSE

Yes?

GROUP
(OS, Laughing)
CELINE
So you're a writer?
Yeah.

JESSE
Yeah, sure.

CELINE
So you write like... books?
GROUP
(Laughing)
JESSE
I've written a few, sure.
yeah.
Wow.

Sure,

CELINE
I've never met a writer before.

JESSE
(Laughing Nervously)
Really. Yeah?

47.
CELINE
You must be really smart.
JESSE
Well, I - you know.
CELINE
You know, I can't even write my own
name sometimes when I'm tired.
JESSE
What kind of books do you like?
CELINE
Well, I like stories with a meaning
behind them, like a really beautiful
love story...
JESSE
Oh, sure, yeah.
CELINE
You know, I read this book once,
"Romeo and..."
JESSE
"...Juliet". Right?
Yeah!
Oh, yeah.

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
Wow, you know it!
JESSE
It's very good, yeah.
actually, not a book.

It's a play
A play.

CELINE
Oh, I thought it was a book based on
the movie.
No -

JESSE

(Laughs)
No, a play, yeah.
GROUP
(OS, Laughing)

48.
CELINE
Okay, it was a play. Wow. Well,
actually I didn't read the whole
thing because you know, sometimes I
have to keep up and read those
magazines to know exactly what is
going on in all those people's lives.
JESSE
Well, that is important.
CELINE
Okay. Well, you're very, very smart
and
(whispering)
I bet you have a gigantic penis.
JESSE
Why am I finding myself so attracted
to this woman!
CELINE
Yes, he is - calm down!
(Reacts)
Wow.

GROUP
STEFANOS

CELINE
And that's the funny part of it!
The not-so-funny part of the closet
macho, okay -- is that today, after
we drop Henry off, he tells me that
even though I have an offer for an
amazing job, he wants me to throw it
all away and move to Chicago.
JESSE
That's not what I said.
Yes.

CELINE

JESSE
I said I missed him. You were
expressing something you felt
conflicted about and I did the same.
CELINE
So we can baby sit every other weekend
for his ex-wife! I mean hilarious.

49.
ARIADNI
Hey, hey, hey! You guys stop it.
It must have been so hard saying
goodbye to Hank today, right?
CELINE
Yeah, of course.
ARIADNI
I mean, he's such an amazing kid.
ACHILLES
Tell him I already miss my chess
partner.
Right away.

JESSE

ARIADNI
When Stefanos and I split up...
STEFANOS

Yeah?

ARIADNI
I'm getting full custody.
STEFANOS
Oh. Well that's ok for a while
because me and my 20 year old
girlfriend will be a little
preoccupied.
(Laughs)

GROUP

ARIADNI
(laughter)
I love men.
STEFANOS
And I love you.
ARIADNI
Ok, I have a story that my husband
here loves and that's going tell you
everything you need to know about
masculine and feminine. Right?
Okay, ready?
Yeah.

JESSE/STEFANOS

50.
ARIADNI
My mom used to be a nurse. So she
was there when people were coming
out of their comas.
STEFANOS
Oh, that story. Yeah.
Listen!

ARIADNI
Listen.

STEFANOS
I'm listening.
ARIADNI
It's an interesting story.
STEFANOS
I'm listening.
ARIADNI
So she was the one to tell them,
"Hi, my name's Katerina. You're
coming out of a coma."
Stefanos is mouthing words behind her.
ANNA
(Laughing)
I'm sorry.
ARIADNI
"You've been in a really bad
automobile accident. You're going
to be okay."
Ariadni puts her hands over Stefanos' mouth.
ARIADNI (CONT'D)
"You're going to be fine," and you
know, stuff like that. She said
that every woman, the very first
thing, the first reaction she would
have would be to ask about everybody
else. "How are my kids? How's my
husband? Is anyone else hurt?"
Every man - with no exception - when
they were told this, what was the
first thing they did? Looked down
at their cock.
(Laughs)

GROUP

51.
JESSE
Well, you know what? You've gotta
make sure it's still there, all right?
You've gotta make sure it's still
working, you have to!
ARIADNI
Of course, of course!
STEFANOS
Alive and kicking.
ARIADNI
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
STEFANOS
Yeah, all that.
ARIADNI
And only eventually, eventually,
they would come around to asking
about their kids, or about someone
else they might have accidentally
killed. Stuff like that. Important
stuff.
CELINE
Doesn't that just say it all? Penis
first, then the rest of the world.
ARIADNI, ANNA, WOMEN
(Chanting)
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis,
penis-JESSE
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. If you can
explain it all on strictly gender
terms, why do you or why does any
woman waste time getting mad at or
bother trying to change a man?
STEFANOS
Exactly. It's all biology.
the problem?

What is

CELINE
(to Jesse)
And you're so, so good at turning
things around. I mean, he is a
genius!

52.
JESSE
No, I'm just trying to say it's like
being pissed at a frog for being
green.
STEFANOS

Exactly.
Yeah.

CELINE
Yeah, exactly!

ANNA
Hearing all this, I wonder if this
idea of a love affair that lasts
forever is still relevant to us? I
mean, we know that we are going to
break up eventually.
Definitely.

ACHILLES

JESSE
(to Anna and Achilles)
Okay, but are your parents still
together?
No way.
No.

ANNA

JESSE
And what about you?

They are.

ACHILLES
But they could be divorced.

JESSE
Yeah, they could.
ACHILLES
(Laughs)
I mean, I think that if they had
more money they wouldn't still be
together.
ARIADNI
God, you guys are so practical! I
was born into the wrong generation.
ANNA
My grandmother's mother wrote to our
whole family a twenty-six page letter
from her deathbed. And she spent
three pages on the costumes she did
for a play and only one paragraph on
her husband.

53.
JESSE
Was she an actress too?
ANNA
No, she was a...
(in French)
How do you say, seamstress?
CELINE
(in English)
A seamstress. Seamstress.
ANNA
Seamstress...and she had all these
wonderful friends. About my great
grandfather she mentioned three
events: He went to the war, we moved
because of his job, and he died.
Her big advice was not to be too
consumed with romantic love.
Friendships and work, she said,
brought her the most happiness.
ARIADNI
I couldn't agree more. I mean, that's
the thing that fucks us up, right?
This idea of a soul mate, of someone
who will come to complete us and
save us from having to take care of
ourselves. With Stefanos, I set the
bar extremely low - I know he is not
going to meet any of my needs.
GROUP
(Laughing)
STEFANOS
Definitely not!
ACHILLES
(to Patrick)
So what about grandma?
soul mate?

Was she a

PATRICK
Well, sounds appealing, but actually
your grandmother was more rational
than that. She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same, with
plenty of room to meet in the middle.
ANNA
Yeah that sounds ideal.

54.
STEFANOS
Yeah, it is, actually.

It is.

PATRICK
But it must be obvious that my wife
is not here today. We were never
one person, always two. We preferred
it that way.
ARIADNI
That's so beautiful. I think my
husband is always trying to almost
colonize me, you know.
STEFANOS
I colonize you?
ARIADNI
Yes, but I colonize you, too, darling.
STEFANOS
Well okay then.
PATRICK
But at the end of the day, it's not
the love of one other person that
matters, it's the love of life.
STEFANOS
That's good to know, Patrick, because
life I can handle, Ariadni, on the
other hand... We all know that the
Greeks invented tragedy, right, and
on top of that she's from the region
of Mani, which is short for maniac!
(Laughs)

GROUP

CELINE
Ask about the hotel.
JESSE
Hey, you guys, if we can't make that
hotel room tonight, could you get a
refund, or use it yourselves or STEFANOS
No, no, we don't get a refund.
ARIADNI
Are you trying to get out of it?
Because you're going.

55.
STEFANOS
You gotta go.
CELINE
No, it's such a great gift you've
given us, but I'm so stressed getting
all the packing ready, the girls and No, no, no -

ARIADNI

STEFANOS
We made a deal, guys, you watched
our kids. You're gonna love it.
ARIADNI
We're going to watch yours.
STEFANOS
It's really, really good.
ARIADNI
It's a fantastic, fantastic walk to
the hotel, and you won't regret it.
And we'll be very offended if you
don't go.
It is.
Okay.

STEFANOS
CELINE
Thank you.

ARIADNI
You're going.
NATALIA
Well, when I think of Elias, what I
miss the most about him is the way
he used to lie down next to me at
night. Sometimes his arm would
stretch along my chest. I couldn't
move, I even held my breath, but I
felt safe... complete. I miss the
way he was whistling walking down
the street. Every time I do
something, I think of what he would
say: "Well its cold today, wear a
scarf." But lately I've been
forgetting little things. He's sort
of fading and I'm starting to forget
him and it's like losing him again.
(MORE)

56.
NATALIA (CONT'D)
Sometimes, I make myself remember
every detail of his face - the exact
color of his eyes, his lips, his
teeth, the texture of his skin, his
hair - that was all gone by the time
he went. And sometimes, not always,
but sometimes I can actually see
him. It is as if a cloud moves away
and there he is. I could almost
touch him, but then the real world
rushes in, and he vanishes again.
For a while, I did this every morning,
when the sun was not too bright
outside because the sun somehow makes
him vanish. He appears and he
disappears like a sunrise or sunset,
anything so ephemeral. Just like
our life - we appear and we disappear
and we are so important to some,
but, we are just passing through.
JESSE
(Toasting)
To passing through.
EXT. WALK - EVENING
Celine and Jesse are walking through a very old area, in midconversation.
JESSE
... And eventually he catches his
face in the window's reflection.
And he realizes he's no longer a
nine-year-old boy, right? He's
suddenly old, he's got a beard, his
eyes are watery, and he's still CELINE
Oh, this one seems sad. At first I
thought you were going to tell me
the story about the guy that has an
imaginary friend.
Which one?

JESSE

CELINE
And when he's in his fifties the
imaginary friend shows up again,
right?
JESSE
With the hummingbird?

57.
CELINE
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah.

JESE
Oh, you like that one?

It's funny.
Oh.

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
Remember that letter that you let me
read that you wrote when you were
twenty, to yourself at forty?
JESSE
Yeah, I remember the first sentence:
Dear Forty-Year-Old Jesse, I hope
you're not divorced.
CELINE
No, I didn't even remember that part.
I meant all the other things in that
letter...you were the same guy.
Yeah...

JESSE

CELINE
I mean, we always think we're
evolving, but maybe we can't change
that much.
JESSE
You know how I think I've changed
the most?
How?

CELINE

JESSE
When I was younger I just wanted
time to speed up. You know?
Why?

CELINE

JESSE
Well. So I could be on my own. So
I could be free from my parents and
school and all that shit. You know?
(MORE)

58.
JESSE (CONT'D)
I just wanted to close my eyes and
wake up and be an adult. And then I
kind of feel like that all happened
and I just want everything to slow
down.
CELINE
Hm... it's strange - I've always had
this feeling, no matter where I am
in my life, that it's either a memory
or a dream.
JESSE
I know, you've always thought that.
And me too, it's like, is this really
my life? Like, is it happening right
now?
It is.
I know.

CELINE
JESSE

Celine and Jesse laugh.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Every year I just seem to get a little
bit more humbled and more overwhelmed
about all the things I'm never going
to know or understand.
CELINE
That's what I keep telling you.
know nothing!

You

JESSE
I know, I know! I'm coming around!
Celine and Jesse laugh.
CELINE
But not knowing is not so bad. I
mean, the point is to be looking,
searching. To stay hungry, right?
JESSE
I know, it's true. I just wish it
was a little easier.
CELINE
How do you mean?

59.
JESSE
Well, just to maintain a certain
level of passion, you know? I mean
it used to come so naturally. I
remember when I was younger, me and
all my writer friends, we just felt
like we were doing something
important, you know? Like this was
our time.
CELINE
But you were all a bunch of arrogant
little pricks, right?
JESSE

No, we Sounds like.
(Laugh)

CELINE

JESSE
All right, maybe. I don't know, it
just grew out of all this energy you
know, this creativity or whatever
ambitions people had. You know, I
think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.
CELINE
Young men have this thing about
comparing themselves all the time.
They have all these signposts they
judge themselves by. You used to do
that all the time.
Do what?

JESSE
What do you mean?

CELINE
With like: Rimbaud read this by
seventeen, F. Scott Fitzgerald did
this by thirty...
JESSE
And Balzac wrote a book before
breakfast every day, so what the
hell am I doing?
CELINE
Yeah. But women don't think that
way as much.
JESSE
You don't think so?

60.
CELINE
No. We have much less to compare
ourselves to maybe. Most women who
achieve anything in life, the first
time you hear about them, they're in
their 50's, because it was so hard
for them to get any recognition before
then. They struggle for 30 years or
they raise kids and were stranded at
home before they could finally do
what they want. Actually, you know
what? It's kind of freeing. We
don't have to spend our lives
comparing ourselves to Martin Luther
King, Gandhi, Tolstoy...
JESSE
(Laughing)
Well, what about Joan of Arc, right?
I mean, she was a teenager and she
saved France. So...
CELINE
Who wants to be Joan of Arc, okay?
No?

JESSE

CELINE
Forget France. She was burned at
the stake and a virgin! Okay?
Nothing I aspire to. What a great
achievement!
JESSE
(Laughing)
Okay! All right, all right, all
right. Whatever.
(Laughs)
Oh, god.
What?
No, nothing.
What?

CELINE

JESSE
CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
It's just so weird.

61.
JESSE
What do you mean?
CELINE
Oh, just this. Us.
a conversation...
Oh, I know.

Walking, having

JESSE

CELINE
... About something else than
scheduling, food, work.
JESSE
Yeah, I mean, how long's it been
since we just wandered around
bullshitting?
CELINE
Do you hear what I hear?
The sea?
No.

JESSE
CELINE

JESSE
What, oh! No small feet. Nothing
being knocked over, nothing we have
to clean up, no injustices being
done.
Yeah.

CELINE
So when was the last time?

JESSE
When we had nowhere we had to be?
Yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
You remember walking around Luxembourg
Gardens?
Yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
Do you? I used to kick your ass at
ping pong on those concrete tables.

62.
CELINE
Hey, congratulations! You beat a
woman pregnant with twins!
JESSE
Well, it's better than losing to a
pregnant woman with twins.
CELINE
Such a gentleman! Yeah.
JESSE
(a beat)
Hah-ha! You know what I think? I
think its from the time we leave our
parents house until we have kids that's the only time your life is
completely your own. You know I
think I had about a decade of that.
It was great. It was just like one
long, flowing... a day, a week, a
year, there wasn't much difference.
CELINE
No, I used to keep track of time
through jobs and boyfriends and stuff
like that. Now I can tell you every
detail of the past seven years based
on what was happening in the girls'
lives.
Yeah, right.

JESSE
Totally.

CELINE
You do that too?
JESSE
Yeah, I mean time's demarcated now...
Really?
Why?

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
No, no, I'm just surprised. I'm
surprised you do that too. No but,
okay - quick test.
Oh, no...

JESSE

63.
CELINE
August 2009. Come on, it's a quick
one. What was happening?
JESSE
August 2009 - we were on vacation
with your parents. Nina got the
chicken pox first, quickly followed
by Ella.
CELINE
I'm so impressed.
Yeah.

JESSE
So do I get a gold star?

Maybe. Hey.
question?

CELINE
Can I ask you a
JESSE

Sure.

CELINE
If we were meeting for the first
time today on a train, would you
find me attractive?
Of course.

JESSE

CELINE
No, but really, right now as I am?
Would you start talking to me? Would
you ask me to get off the train with
you?
(Laugh)

CELINE/JESSE

JESSE
Well, I mean, you're asking a
theoretical question. I mean, what
would my life situation be? I mean
technically, wouldn't I be cheating
on you?
Okay.

CELINE
Why can't you just say "yes"?

No, I did.
That was -

JESSE
I said, "of course"!

64.
CELINE
No-no-no! I wanted you to say
something romantic and you blew it.
JESSE
Oh, okay. Alright, wait - if I saw
you on a train, okay, listen. I
would lock eyes with you.
CELINE

Uh-huh.

JESSE
And then I'd walk right up to you
and I'd say, "Hey, baby. You are
making me as horny as a billy goat
in a briar patch."
He grabs her ass.
CELINE
Stop it, that's disgusting! Billy
goat. No, the truth is, you failed
the test. And the fact is, you would
not pick me up on a train. You
wouldn't even notice me, a fat-assed
middle-aged mom, losing her hair.
JESSE
Okay.
(Laughing)
Losing her hair?
CELINE
Yeah, that's me!
JESSE
You set me up to fail.
you did.
Okay, true.

Honestly,

CELINE
True.

JESSE
Alright? Alright? But in the real
world, baldy, on game day when it
mattered, I DID talk to you on a
train. I did that, it was the best
thing I ever did.
Really?

CELINE
Look at the goats.

Hello.

65.
JEESE
Hey. Alright. You know, that's not
even a good question, all right?
The real question would be if I DID
ask you to get off a train...
Yeah?

CELINE

JESSE
Would you get off with me?
CELINE
No, of course not. I have people
waiting for me.
JESSE
Yeah, see, so?
CELINE
You know, and
(Laughing)
A forty-one-year-old horny billy
goat? How creepy! I'm creeped out
right now. Help, politzia!
JESSE
I can't believe I'm 41.
CELINE
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so
old. I never thought I'd sleep with
anyone over 40.
JESSE
Yeah, yeah... what?
CELINE
Actually, you know what? You're the
oldest guy I've ever slept with.
JESSE
Well, that's something.
It's true.

That's good.

CELINE

JESSE
I know I'm not the oldest guy you've
ever blown.
What?

CELINE

66.
JESSE
That conference in Warsaw?
CELINE
What conference?
Lech Walesa.

JESSE

CELINE
Lech Walesa... oh, what are you
talking about?
JESSE
It's okay. It was before we were
together, you can admit it. I can
remember the way you talked about
how he "opened your heart". You
definitely blew him. Definitely.
CELINE
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.
That was Gorbachev, okay? You
geographically challenged, football
obsessed, donut loving American.
That was Gorbachev.
JESSE
I'm sorry, I got my Eastern Bloc
leaders mixed up. Okay?
CELINE
And I didn't blow him at all!
Take it back!
Okay.
God!

JESSE
All right, okay.

Okay?

Okay!

CELINE

JESSE
So was it Vaclav Havel?

Or -

CELINE
All right, you know..
EXT. WALK PART TWO - EVENING
They're now walking through a small, very old town.
JESSE
Listen to this. I was going to wait
to tell you this until later but,
whatever. I'm so bad with secrets.

67.
CELINE
What? You have a tumor in your brain?
You're going to die?
JESSE
No, no, no, no. Nothing like that
alright? Well actually, it's kinda
like that. My grandmother died.
What?

When?

CELINE

JESSE
Yeah, my dad texted me right before
we ate.
CELINE
Oh, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you
tell me?
JESSE
Ah, I know. Well, everybody's been
expecting it. You know, she lived a
long time, had a great life. She
was ninety-six.
CELINE
Okay. She didn't live much longer
after your grandfather died, though.
JESSE
No, barely a year. I mean the funny
thing is, this woman was a frickin'
saint.
Yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
She was a nurse in the war, she took
care of all of us, you know. I mean,
she never said an unkind word about
anybody.
CELINE
Ah, I wish I'd met her.
JESSE
No, it's okay, because by the end,
you know, she just really wasn't
into meeting new people. I mean
after a lifetime of being sweet as
pie - once grandpa died, she got
kinda ornery.

68.
CELINE
Well you know, it happens, she was
in mourning, no?
JESSE
Well, my dad said she was just waiting
to die.
CELINE
How long were they married?
JESSE

74 years.

CELINE

Fuck!
(Laughs)
Yeah.

JESSE

CELINE
How is that even possible? How old
will we be if we're together seventyfour years?
JESSE
Mm... well, when would we start
counting from?
CELINE
I guess from the first time we had
sex. No?
JESSE
Okay. Yeah, good. So, so um, 1994.
(Muttering, Calculating
Under His Breath)
Okay.
now.
Okay.
Ugh!!!

CELINE
'94... fifty-six years from
JESSE
We will be ninety-eight.
CELINE/JESSE

CELINE
Will you be able to put up with me
for another fifty-six more years? I
need to know! Okay? 'Cause I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to put up
with you.

69.
JESSE
It's crazy if you think about all
the change they saw. I mean, when
they met neither one of them had
electricity. He used to take her to
school on his horse, right?
CELINE
Oh, that's so romantic... it's
incredible.
JESSE
I know. When they graduated, he was
valedictorian and she was
salutatorian.
CELINE
What is that?
JESSE
He was top of the class and she was
second.
CELINE
I bet she knowingly got a couple of
answers wrong just to make sure he
didn't feel threatened.
JESSE
Well, if she wanted to get laid,
she'd better have.
CELINE
Yeah, obviously like you-know-who.
JESSE
Right. Well, anyway, so I called my
dad, right? After I got the text,
just to...
CELINE
Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
JESSE
... You know, tell him I was sorry...
but I think I kind of screwed up.
At some point I told him 'Hey Dad,
you're an orphan now.' He didn't
think that was funny.
CELINE
No, it's not funny at all.
JESSE
Yeah, I guess not.
(MORE)

70.
(Laughs)

JESSE (CONT'D)

CELINE
He's next, then you.
JESSE
I know. Well, he told me that my
grandparents want to have a joint
service. They want to have their
ashes intermingled and be buried as
one.
CELINE
Your grandfather didn't have a
funeral?
JESSE
No, remember? They vowed to each
other they'd never have to attend
one another's funerals.
CELINE
Oh, yeah. I kind of like the idea
of you attending mine.
(Laughs)
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Imagining you in a suit, clean shaven
for once... and holding hands with
the girls... I don't know, I like
it.
JESSE
You're gonna outlive me.
CELINE
Well, I'll see. I guess one of us
will see.
JESSE
You think you want to go to the
service with me?
To Texas?

CELINE

JESSE
Uh, it's not going to be in Paris.

71.
CELINE
How bad do you want me there? I
mean I would come but it's really
expensive with the flights...
JESSE
Just skip it - it'd be simpler to go
alone.
CELINE
(To Barking Dog)
Oh, hello.
JESSE
Hello, buddy.
CELINE
Well you know, if I'm not there it'll
be easier for you to fuck your
cousins.
JESSE
(Laughs)
Yes, that's true.
CELINE
Yeah. Isn't that common where you
come from? I mean... you didn't
answer the question.
JESSE
What question?
CELINE
Will you be able to put up with me
for another 56 more years?
JESSE
I am looking forward to it.
CELINE
Shit, you're really working it.
JESSE
(Spanish accent returns)
Ze nectar of your sex ages like a
fine wine.
CELINE
Uh-oh, my hairy Spanish lover is
back.
JESSE
Greek. I'm Greek now, for sure.
Greek, yeah.

72.
CELINE
(a beat)
Oh! Look at this! Wow. This place
sort of reminds me of this film I
saw when I was a teenager. It was a
black and white film from the 50s.
I remember a couple walking through
the ruins of Pompeii, looking at
bodies that had been lying there for
centuries. I remember the bodies
caught in their sleep, still lovingly
holding each other. I don't know
why, sometimes I have this image in
my mind when, you know, we're asleep
and you hold me.
JESSE
What, of being buried alive under
molten ash, that's what you're
thinking about?
CELINE
Yeah!
(Laughing)
JESSE
That's not very fun.
CELINE
(Laughing)
Well... I don't know, it's not
horrible. They had some bodies with
little kids sleeping between them...
JESSE
Oh, that's nice!
CELINE
Yeah! I guess I was young and a bit
morbid - I mean at that age you
romanticize the idea of dying with
the person you love.
JESSE
Well, you wanna die with me?
CELINE
Maybe, if it were, you know, our
first night together, then, a long
time ago. But now, no. I'd like to
live!

73.
JESSE
Well, I just wanted you to say
something romantic and you blew it!
Putain de merde!
CELINE
Oh, no! Putain de merde, I blew it.
Okay, if we're both 98 you can ask
me again, but anytime sooner...Ehhnt!
(Whispers)
Sorry.
They are walking by an old, tiny Chapel.
JESSE
Hey, this is the chapel I was telling
you about. It's from the Byzantine
era, it's like a thousand years old.
CELINE
Can we go in?
JESSE
Yeah. I think so.
Hello? Hello.
Oh, wow!

Check this out.

CELINE

They enter.
INT. CHAPEL - AFTERNOON
JESSE
It's a shrine to Saint Odilia, a
patron saint to eyesight. People
come from all over, they leave little
dedications to the blind, to help
restore sight.
CELINE
I'm sure it works.
He is looking at the old faded paintings on the walls.
JESSE
Maybe. These paintings here, they
make me think of those Japanese monks,
you know, with their deal on
impermanence. They like to paint
with water on rock on a hot day so
by the time they're done it's already
evaporated.
Celine notices all the icons have been subtly defaced.

74.
CELINE
All the eyes are scratched out.
that about the blindness?

Is

JESSE
No, I thought that too, but the
caretaker guy, he told me that the
Turks did that during the Occupation.
CELINE
That's it! I'm never eating Turkish
food again.
JESSE
Oh, okay. Well, that'll send a shiver
through the international community.
CELINE
Okay fine, then I'll never suck
another Turkish cock.
JESSE
(Laughs)
Now THAT's gonna have a global impact.
CELINE
Oh, that's terrible. No, I forgot
you're a closet Christian. Is it
really bad to make blow-job jokes in
a church?
Jesse just shrugs.
JESSE
Kind of is, okay? But we've done
worse.
CELINE
(a beat)
The girls asked me again what our
wedding was like.
Yeah?

JESSE
What'd you say?

CELINE
I said it was very low key.
JESSE
Yeah, very low key. So low key I
don't even remember it.
Very Quaker.

CELINE
(MORE)

75.
CELINE (CONT'D)
I don't know why they want us to be
married so badly. It's important to
them.
JESSE
We're in a church.

No.
No.

You want to get

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
It's just all those fairy tales they
like so much, you know? Remember
when they were little, at the end of
every cartoon they watched, they'd
be all "Oh they're getting married!"
Even if it's Pinocchio and his dad,
or Donald Duck and his nephews.
EXT. WALK PART THREE- EVENING
They are now walking through the town on their way to the
shore.
CELINE
So if we're going to spend another
fifty-six more years together...
Yeah?

JESSE

CELINE
... What about me would you like to
change?
JESSE
(Smirks)
That's another one of your can't-win
questions. I'm not answering that.
CELINE
What do you mean? There's not one
thing you'd like to change about me?
I'm perfect?
Okay.
Okay.

JESSE
CELINE

76.
Actually...
One thing.

JESSE
CELINE

JESSE
... If I could change one thing about
you...
CELINE

Uh-huh.

JESSE
... It would be for you to stop trying
to change me.
CELINE
You're a very skilled manipulator,
you know that?
JESSE
Well, I'm onto you.
work.
You think?

I know how you

CELINE

JESSE
Yeah. I know everything about you.
Here we go. Let's go through here.
CELINE
I don't think you do, actually.
(Laughs)
JESSE
(Laughs)
No? Well, I know you better than I
know anybody else on the planet.
But... maybe that's not saying much.
CELINE
I mean right now?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
This is great. You know?
Right.

JESSE
Yeah.

77.
CELINE
I feel close to you.
JESSE

Yeah.

CELINE
But sometimes, I don't know, I feel
like you're breathing helium and I'm
breathing oxygen.
JESSE
(helium voice)
What makes you say that?
See?

Huh?

CELINE
I'm trying to truly connect -

JESSE
(Helium voice)
What? Come on, I'm just being
myself!
CELINE
- And you make a joke! That's exactly
what I'm talking about!
JESSE
Oh, listen, come on, come on. If
we're ever going to truly know one
another, I think we'd probably have
to get to know ourselves better first.
CELINE
Yeah. Do you remember this friend
of mine? George, from New York.
No.

JESSE

CELINE
Oh, no, that was before.
before.
What was?

That was

JESSE

CELINE
He was this friend of mine that,
when he found out he had leukemia,
and he was probably going to die, he
confessed to me that the first thing
that came to his mind was relief.

78.
Relief?

JESSE
But why?

CELINE
Well, before he found out he had
nine months to live he was always so
worried about money, and now his
thought was, great! I have more
than enough money to live for the
next nine months, I've made it!
JESSE
(Laughing)
Oh, okay.
CELINE
And then he was finally able to enjoy
everything about life, even like
being stuck in traffic. He would
just enjoy looking at people...
staring at their faces. Just little
things.
JESSE
And then what happened?
CELINE
What do you mean?
JESSE
Well, like, is he still alive?
No, he died.

CELINE
A long time ago.
JESSE

(a beat)
Last night I had this dream where I
was reading a book. It was a lost
classic, "The Rovers".
CELINE
"The Rovers"?
JESSE
Yeah, like roving around, you know,
wandering? It was all these young
people.
Okay.

CELINE
Is that a real book?

No, no, no.

JESSE

79.
No?

CELINE

JESSE
But it was really great.
Okay.

CELINE

JESSE
It was fresh, funny, experimental,
it had all this energy...
CELINE
I love that you read books in your
dreams.
JESSE
I know, and they're always really
good.
CELINE
I have major action hero dreams,
like I'm flying around like a
superhero, breaking through walls.
And at the end, I have an orgasm.
JESSE
(Laughs)
Well, I'm gonna try to make your
dreams come true, babe.
They arrive at the waterfront.
the ocean.

The sun is now setting over

EXT. CAFE - EVENING
They are now sitting at an outdoor table with a couple of
glasses of wine, staring at the last bit of the fireball,
quickly disappearing.
CELINE
Still there. Still there. ... Still
there. Still there. ... Gone.
They sit in silence. Eventually, Jesse looks over at Celine
and notices she's moved. He just takes her hand. The sun
is now gone.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
As they are checking into the hotel, Jesse is signing various
paperwork.

80.
HOTEL CLERK #1
I need your credit card.
JESSE
Oh, I think the room is paid for.
HOTEL CLERK #1
Yes it is, but the credit card is
for
(Speaks Greek)
Incidentals.

CELINE

JESSE
Right, of course.
Another HOTEL CLERK (#2) emerges from office with his two
books.
Mr. Wallace?

SOFIA
JESSE

Yeah?

SOFIA
I am such a fan of these two books.
My husband gave me your book on our
first date and then when your second
book came out, we read it out loud
together.
Oh, wow.

JESSE

SOFIA
Would you please sign them to us?
JESSE
Yeah, of course, of course.
Thank you.

SOFIA

JESSE
I love the art work on these Greek
editions, it's really nice. Uh,
what do you need?
SOFIA
Make it to Sofia and Pavlos.
Okay.

JESSE
How's the Greek translation?

81.
As Jesse signs the books, the Hotel Clerk starts paying
attention to Celine.
SOFIA
Well, it's called "Afti ti Fora,
Ekini ti Fora"
JESSE
"Ekini ti Fora."
SOFIA
But I'm not sure it's a great one.
JESSE
Well, that's because you never read
it in English, right?
SOFIA
Exactly. ... That's great.
you sign them too?
CELINE

Me?
Yes.

Could

SOFIA
You're the real Madeline, right?

CELINE
Madeline? Not really. People assume
it's me but it's - it's not me at
all. He's got a big imagination.
SOFIA
Would you be so kind? It would mean
so much to my husband.
The book is passed to Celine.
CELINE
I can't sign a book I didn't write.
It doesn't make Jesse passes the books to Celine.
JESSE
She'd be happy to.
Okay.

SOFIA
Thank you.

CELINE
I'm happy to.
She begins to sign.

82.
Efharisto.

JESSE

Okay.

CELINE
Thank you.

Great.

SOFIA
Thank you so much.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Celine and Jesse enter the room.
JESSE
Check it out!
CELINE
Wow, this is nice!
Yeah.

JESSE

CELINE
Clean... air conditioning... I love
it! Oh my god.
It's great.

JESSE

CELINE
Wow, oh wow, that bath tub.
Jesse goes over to the table to examine what's on it.
JESSE
Hey, check this out. Stefanos and
Ariadni got us a bottle of wine and
a couple's massage.
CELINE
They are so nice, we have to get
them a present before we leave.
JESSE
I know, we should remember to get
something for the kids, too.
CELINE
Yeah, I know. For sure.
miss the girls.
Jesse seductively touches her.
JESSE
Mmm, I don't.

Wow.

I

83.
Then kisses her.

She eventually looks out the window.

CELINE
This is such a nice view.

Look.

JESSE
The only view that I am interested
in...
CELINE

What?

JESSE
... Is right... here.
see this.

Here.

Let's

He slowly undoes her top, revealing her still-perfect breasts.
They kiss passionately.
JESSE (CONT'D)
(Whispering)
What?
CELINE
(touches his chin)
It's funny. I never noticed until
today but... all the red in your
beard is gone. It used to be one of
the things that made me fall for
you, it's crazy.
JESSE
Well, it's not gone, it's just white.
You're not gonna tell me that your
love is dependent on pigment, are
you? No?
CELINE
No, but you know, I see the red in
our girls' eyelashes. I look at
them and it makes me think of when
we met.
JESSE
You know what I'm looking forward
to?
Yeah?

What?

After uh...
After?

CELINE
JESSE
CELINE

84.
JESSE
Yeah.
(Laughing)
What?

CELINE

JESSE
Is waking up next to you alone.
CELINE
You mean without Nina and Ella jumping
on our heads.
JESSE
Exactly. I haven't heard you think
in years now.
Think?

CELINE

JESSE
I used to wake up to that sound of
your eyes opening and closing, and
that brain of yours going two million
miles an hour. I miss it, hearing
you think.
CELINE
When you said you could hear me think,
I really thought you could. But it
was just my eyelids. How dumb and
romantic of me.
JESSE
It's my favorite thing.
CELINE
I miss thinking, too. No more
thinking in the morning, no more
morning sex.
Tomorrow...

JESSE

CELINE
I'm looking forward to it so much, I
don't think I will sleep.
JESSE
I'm looking forward to right now.
CELINE
Okay, then stop talking, so we can
fuck.

85.
They kiss until Celine's cell phone rings.
CELINE (CONT'D)
(Laughs)
Oh, shit, who is it?
The kids.

JESSE

Celine crawls out of bed and heads across the room toward
her bag.
CELINE
I said they could call in case of
emergency only. Hope the girls are
okay. Okay. Oh, it's Henry. Okay.
Celine picks up.
CELINE (CONT'D)
Hi sweetie - are you okay? Are you
in London? Oh! Oh, already?
(listens)
Oh, no, we found it. Uh, we'll mail
it tomorrow morning.
(listens)
Yeah. Ohh, they miss you, too.
I'll kiss them for you. Okay, I'll
tell him. Good luck with your mom I love you too. Bye.
Celine hangs up.
ignored.

Jesse gestures for the phone are again

CELINE (CONT'D)
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.
JESSE
Why can't I talk to him? That's
twice you've done that. C'mon, you
could have just handed me the phone.
You know I want to talk to him.
CELINE
Well, he didn't have time to talk he said they were boarding.
JESSE
And what'd he forget?
Jesse glares.

What was that?

86.
CELINE
His science project. But we'll mail
it tomorrow. It'll be fine.
JESSE
You shouldn't have said that about
his mom.
What?

CELINE
What did I say?

JESSE
"Good luck with your mom."
(Laughs)
I mean, come on CELINE
I didn't mean anything by it.
JESSE
I know, but it's not good. It just
reminds him of the whole thing. I
just wish you wouldn't do that...
CELINE
Oh, like you think he forgets?
No...

JESSE

CELINE
That's so American to just sweep it
under the carpet and act as if it
didn't happen.
JESSE
Why put it into his head? You know?
What if he doesn't want to be thinking
about that right now? He's too
stressed.
CELINE
It means nothing.
JESSE
It means something.

It does.

CELINE
Alright, I even made a joke the other
day that his mom and I should try to
settle it in one big mud wrestling
contest.
JESSE
Mud wrestling? You said that?

87.
CELINE
And he laughed. He might have more
of a sense of humor than you do.
Come on.
JESSE
We just talked about that. When you
say bad things about his mom, what
he hears is bad things about himself.
CELINE
Well, I didn't say anything bad about
his mom. I made a joke; it's as
much on me as it is on her.
JESSE
Well you're right. I know, I know,
I know. Just why conjure it up at
all, you know?
Jesse gets up out of bed and goes across the room, goes to
Celine's purse and turns off her phone.
CELINE
I think he's old enough now. I mean,
he knows how bad it is between his
mother and I.
JESSE
His mom and me.
CELINE
And I didn't do anything, it's all
coming from her towards me. Okay,
she hates me; yes, I fucked her
husband a long time ago. Or should
I say, he fucked me?
Yeah, right!

JESSE

CELINE
Making a joke about the fact that
his mom and I don't love each other
is not the issue. That's not going
to traumatize him. That already
happened, alright, and now you're
trying to transfer your guilt and
blame me?
No, I'm not.

JESSE

88.
CELINE
You know, on the contrary, if he can
make a joke about it, maybe he'll be
able to live with it better. That's
what I think.
JESSE
Okay. You're right. As always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?
CELINE
It's nobody's fault if his mom is a
drunk and abusive psychologically.
JESSE
Don't say that!
CELINE
I mean, it makes me sick that he has
to be with her, but I guess judges
assume that women have the mother
instinct. She has the mother instinct
of Medea!
Jesse goes to the bathroom and washes off his face.
Medea, huh?

JESSE

CELINE
Yeah, after all, it is a Greek myth.
JESSE
It's actually a play by Euripides,
but CELINE
A woman killing her kids to punish
her ex-husband? That's basically
what she's doing, she's hurting him
to get to you.
JESSE
No, she's making my life hell through
him, that's what she's doing. You
know, sometimes, you say things that
just go too far.
CELINE
Okay, stop blaming me for everything
that is wrong in this whole thing
with your wife, okay?
Ex-wife!

JESSE
Ex-wife for a long time!

89.
CELINE
Okay, you should have dealt with it
a little better back then. She
wouldn't have hated us so much.
JESSE
Okay--I screwed up. And I love this
little re-write you do: everything
that isn't perfect in our life gets
laid at my feet...
CELINE
And now you're putting this shit on
me about Henry?
What shit?

JESSE
What're you talking about?

Jesse takes off his pants and returns to the bed. Celine
immediately begins putting on her top and gets up.
CELINE
Let me tell you what I'm talking
about: the moving to Chicago and
giving up of my life. Now that you
mention that Henry needs you, how do
you think that makes me feel? I'm
miserable! Alright? How can I take
that job now? Tell me!
Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty!
no-no-no-no!

No-

JESSE
Look, look. That's a choice you're
making, to look at it like that,
alright?
CELINE
It is in the nature of women to be
the nurturah.
The what?

JESSE

CELINE
Nur-tchur-yer.
JESSE
The nurturer?

90.
CELINE
Okay, I can't even say that fucking
word! I just naturally feel bad
about everything. And you give me
that look, like it's my fault.
What look?

JESSE

CELINE
That look, the I-forgot-to-put-inthe-bag-the-science-project-look. I
know you blame me.
JESSE
I didn't say anything.
CELINE
No. You didn't say anything. You
didn't have to. Yeah, yeah, it's
always my fault.
Yeah right.

JESSE

Celine walks across the room, sits on the couch, and turns
on her phone again.
CELINE
I read on the fridge at work - you
know those magnet words that people
make sentences with? Someone had
put together, "Women explore for
eternity in the vast garden of
sacrifice."
JESSE
(Laughs)
Wow! That's a sure sign from God!
CELINE
Yeah. That line is so damn true and
it's been for ten thousand years.
But that's enough! Okay. I don't
want to be one of these women. Like
marriage is important to gays or
contraception to women rights - it's
the same with giving up my hopes,
with the millions of women that have
had to give up their hopes. I am
not going to do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.
Jesse bursts into applause.

91.
JESSE
Wow! Bravo! The Nobel committee is
taking note. I'm just - hold on a
second, I'm gonna alert Sweden, okay?
I mean, it must be a full-time job
carrying that much feminine
oppression.
It is.

CELINE

JESSE
You suffered so much growing up in
middle-class Paris! I mean, the
agony in the trenches of the Sorbonne
in the post-feminist era. I can't
imagine.
CELINE
You're an asshole. You know what
sweetie, when are we moving to
Chicago? I want to make sure we are
able to find a nice house and I can
sew the drapes and pick matching bed
covers.
JESSE
So this is how you now want to be
spending this evening? I mean, this
is what you wanna do tonight?
CELINE
Well, you started it.
JESSE
No. You are the one who will not
shut up about it. But if you want
to talk about it, I mean, really
talk about it. I would prefer to
have an unemotional, rational
conversation. I mean, do you think
we can do that? Would that be
possible?
CELINE
Here we go. Unemotional, rational.
You always play the part of the one
and only rational one and I'm the
irrational, hysterical, hormone-crazy
one because I have emotions. Yeah,
you sit back and you speak from your
big perspective which means everything
you say is level-headed and true.

92.
JESSE
I don't always do anything.
CELINE
The world is fucked by unemotional
rational men deciding shit, alright?
Politicians going to war for no
reason, corporate heads deciding to
wreck the environment, Cheney,
Rumsfeld - very rational men.
JESSE
Cheney and Rumsfeld?

Yeah, okay.

CELINE
The final solution?
thinking behind it.

Very rational

JESSE
(Laughs)
Oh, okay, so we're there now? Us
versus the final solution? Okay!
Let's do it, alright? Let me ask
you this, alright? Do you think
Henry's life would be helped by a
more consistent presence by you and
me?
CELINE
Here we go...
Jesse gets up from the bed, puts his pants back on, and joins
Celine on the couch.
JESSE
No. You won't drop it, so let's
talk about it. Alright? Let me
just ask you one question. Do you
think Hank's life would be better
served by a more consistent presence
from you and me?
CELINE
Yes! I think it'd be better if he
lived with us...
Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
... And I think his mom is a fucking
alcoholic, hateful cunt that used
the time that we were in Paris and I
was giving birth and almost dying to
(MORE)

93.
CELINE (CONT'D)
legally move Henry out of New York.
Fuck her.
JESSE
Okay. I agree with you.
Unfortunately, we cannot go get him
out of America but we could, if we
wanted to, go to him. Now, I know
it would be a big move, but what do
you think? I mean, is there any way
you could be happy in the U.S.? Is
that just out of the realm of
possibility? That you could find a
comparable job there?
CELINE
Comparable job? Are you kidding?
No.

JESSE

CELINE
Why am I the one that always has to
make the compromises?
JESSE
Oh, Jesus Christ. Don't be so
dramatic, okay?
CELINE
Well, moving to Chicago is pretty
fucking dramatic to me.
JESSE
I'm not saying we should move. I
just want to talk about it. Can you
be my friend for like two seconds so
we can talk?
CELINE
Okay, two seconds.
JESSE
Alright. Do you remember that time
that you were like 35 minutes late
to pick the girls up from school and
you were so stressed out because you
knew they were out there in the
playground wondering what the hell
had happened to you. Okay, that is
the way I feel all the time, you
know like I fucked up. I mean, I
left him behind and I just wanna go
get him.

94.
CELINE
You always get like this when you
drop him off. You're sad, so you
start a fight. He's fine. He's a
great kid. Okay? But the truth is,
he doesn't need you the way he used
to. You missed the opportunity to
be with him everyday of his childhood,
you just did. And you can cry about
it but he's growing up. You're a
great father in other ways. You got
divorced, like millions of other
people. Was it ideal? No. Listen,
if in one month, you still want me
to quit my job and give up everything
I have ben working towards all these
years, just ask me. But right now I
feel the same way I always have. I
would move back to the US if that
diseased ex-wife of yours would give
us joint custody. But every other
weekend amounts to shit Jesse, that's
less than thirty days a semester and
I don't think it's worth it for us
to change our entire lives over that
kind of time.
JESSE
I know, you're right.
CELINE
Right, right? See?
rational one.

I'm being the

JESSE
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know? I mean Hank didn't do
anything but he's the one getting
kicked in the teeth.
CELINE
We all get dragged through our
parents' lives. If it wasn't me,
your marriage would have ended over
something else and you know that.
Absolutely.

JESSE

CELINE
Or even worse, he would have been
raised by two miserable parents.

95.
I know.
up.

JESSE
I just really fucked that

CELINE
You mean you fucked up by moving to
Paris to be with me?
No.

JESSE
That's not what I meant...

CELINE
I knew that was going to cost too
much.
JESSE
That's not what I meant at all!
CELINE
I told you not to do it.
Stop it.

JESSE

CELINE
I moved to New York with you for two
years and gave up everything, but I
needed to be home to give birth to
the twins because it was a complicated
birth and I wanted to be with my
mother. And you wanted it too!
Yes.

Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
Okay. That's the one thing I asked
from you, the one thing. And now
you're going to blame me forever.
JESSE
Stop it will you? Stop it. If you
don't want to move back to the States
we won't. End of story. I'm just
trying to find a way where I can be
more of a consistent presence in his
life, and ideally I'd like to do
that as a family.
CELINE
'As a family?' Or what?
JESSE
What the fuck does that mean?

96.
CELINE
I feel a passive aggressive threat
in everything you say. Either do
this, or I will resent you for the
rest of our lives.
Silence.
CELINE (CONT'D)
No? Am I Right? You know what?
I'm sensing something... I think the
problem is that you don't want me to
have a more substantial job. On
some level, you feel threatened by
my achieving anything that could
diminish your status in our
relationship.
JESSE
My status in our relationship? I
teach two courses a semester at the
fucking American school. Ok wow,
that's really some status.
CELINE
Now I don't think it's any coincidence
that you feel that way at the same
time that I have a truly exciting
job opportunity.
JESSE
This whole train of thought is
complete horse shit and you know it.
CELINE
I have a question for you. If we
didn't have the girls, all our crap.
Would we even still be together?
JESSE
What? I mean you are the fucking
mayor of crazy town, do you know
that? You are.
CELINE
You know what I think? I think you
need to move to Chicago. I think
Henry needs you and I think I need
to stay in Paris with the girls and
take this job.
JESSE
Why are you doing this, huh?
is a ridiculous idea.
(MORE)

That

97.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Like I'm gonna lose you and the girls?
No. Why do you make everything so
difficult?
CELINE
Jesse, you're unhappy with me. You're
blaming me for taking you away from
your son.
JESSE
That is a completely irrational
response to something I am just trying
to feel my way through.
CELINE
Listen, Jesse. We've just spent the
last six weeks here and it's been
great. You've been able to write
everyday and the weather's been nice.
But I didn't want to come to Greece
originally.
I know.

JESSE

CELINE
All right? There could be a
revolution any second...
Don't.

JESSE

CELINE
People eat a lot of feta and olive
oil, they act all happy but they
actually talk about how "angry" they
are... and it confuses me and I don't
know what's going to happen in the
next few weeks.
JESSE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me tell you
what's going to happen alright. The
same thing that always happens:
Nothing.
CELINE
Alright. You know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself, I
have ten thousand emails I have to
answer that I didn't answer...
JESSE
And you think I don't?

98.
CELINE
I spend all day making dinner, wiping
both you and your son's pee off the
toilet seat, while you talk to your
fellow novelists. Blah, blah, blah,
you're a genius, blah, blah, blah,
no, you're a genius. And the second
we say goodbye to Henry, you suggest
that maybe I should give up my dream
job because you feel bad.
JESSE
Oh. Okay, now it's your dream job?!
This afternoon you weren't even sure
you wanted it but now it's your dream
job. Do you ever listen to yourself?
CELINE
Yes it is my dream job! Just because
I have doubts doesn't mean I don't
want it.
Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
All right? But what do you care?
Every day you go on your two hour
"contemplative" walk under the olive
trees. Socrates... you should get a
robe.
JESSE
It's an hour.
CELINE
No, by the time you leave, and by
the time you're actually with us
again, two hours. You know, I could
never do that. You're very good at
taking care of yourself. I take
care of myself, AND everything else.
We're going somewhere, you pack your
bag, I pack EVERYTHING else.
JESSE
You would never let me pack the girls'
shit. Never!
CELINE
Because there would be no shoes and
plenty of dirty underwear.
So says you.

JESSE

99.
CELINE
I'm happy you have time to contemplate
the universe and have existential
problems because I don't - I barely
have time to think. I work, I babysit, I work, I baby-sit.
Jesse wanders off into the bathroom to take a pee.
JESSE
Could you hold on a second? I just
have to tune up the string section...
CELINE
You know what? The only time I get
to think now, is when I take a shit
at the office. I'm starting to
associate thoughts with the smell of
shit.
JESSE
Well, that is a good line - I want
to use that in a book someday.
CELINE
I'm sure you will - and that'll be
the best line in the book.
She walks over and talks to him directly while he's in the
bathroom.
CELINE (CONT'D)
And by the way, you may never, EVER,
use me or anything I say or do in
one of your fucking books again!
And that goes for the girls, too.
Jesse comes back out.
JESSE
Well, A) You shouldn't have hooked
up with a writer. B) You weren't
in the last book or the one I'm
writing now. C) I'm gonna write
about whatever the fuck I want.
CELINE
As always, OUR life works for YOU.
JESSE
No, no, no. Don't give me this put
upon housewife bullshit. Okay this
is not the 50's.
(MORE)

100.
JESSE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry to ruin your perfect little
narrative of oppression with the
truth but I am the one who's at home
everyday dealing with the bullshit
cause you're at work until 6:30.
6 o'clock.

CELINE

JESSE
You take the girls to school, and I
pick them up. That's fair, that's
our deal. We live in Paris, France
for chrissakes.
CELINE
Yeah, and you remind me of it every
single day.
JESSE
I have orbited my entire life around
you and you know it. So I am sorry
if this Summer's vacation - and it
is a vacation - because all I've
seen you do is frolic in the sea and
shove greek salad down your throat.
Ok, but it is not indicative of you
spending your life in some kind of
domestic servitude.
CELINE
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic. Little
fairies around who pick up their
socks, little fairies unload the
dishwasher, little fairies sunscreen
the kids. Little fairies who make
the fucking Greek salads that you
eat like a pig.
JESSE
Okay, listen to me, all right? You
are great at taking care of us. You
are. I mean you take care of the
kids, you take care of your friends,
you take care of the world. Alright?
And you were like that before you
were a mom and now its only magnified.
But, and I've been telling you this
for years - you gotta do a little
bit better job taking care of
yourself. Ok, you do.

101.
CELINE
Okay, stop patronizing me, all right?
I'm the one at home every night at
6.00, not 6.30. I am reliable.
Have you ever booked a baby sitter,
ever, in your entire life? NO.
What is the name of their
pediatrician?
JESSE
Stop quizzing me, all right?
really fucking boring.

It's

CELINE
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at
home every night and I make dinner,
I give baths, and I read bedtime
stories. Sometimes you're there,
sometimes you're at a university
event or a publicity tour. Ok?
When you get "inspired" you keep on
writing. I get inspired too
sometimes, you know that?
JESSE
You want to write?

Great.

Write.

CELINE
No, but you remember I used to sing
and play guitar and write songs?
I'd still like to do it. But I don't
get to - there isn't time.
JESSE
Okay. Well, first off, my writing
isn't a hobby. Secondly, I wish you
would find the time. You somehow
manage to find the time to complain
about 8 hours a day. I mean, I love
the way you sing. Okay? I fucked
up my whole life 'cause of the way
you sing. Alright? If you took one
eighth of the energy that you spend
on bitching, whining and worrying...
If you put that energy into playing
scales, I mean you would be like
fucking Django Reinhardt.
Celine exits...
JESSE (CONT'D)
Okay. All right. Whoops. You forgot
your shoes.
(sighs)
Goddamn. Hell.

102.
And quickly re-enters.
CELINE
You think you're winning?!
(almost losing her
temper)
Very few people realize what it is
like for an active or passionate
woman to have a child. Some friends
told me, "you'll see, you'll want to
throw them out the window." Okay,
but the truth is I never wanted to
hurt them once but I thought about
ending it all for myself a hundred
times. I was so confused, and you
were always away on a stupid book
tour or because of Henry's custody
shit and I didn't want to be a burden.
Now I know why Sylvia Plath put her
head in a toaster.
JESSE
It was an oven.
CELINE
(losing it)
Don't play with words. You know
what I mean - toaster, oven. Same
thing. You know how many times I
was alone with the girls crying with
no clue what to do? Do you know the
guilt a mother feels when she doesn't
know what to do?
JESSE
Do you think you have sole ownership
of that feeling?
CELINE
I don't think you understand, okay?
(a beat)
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man? Is that they all
want to turn me into a submissive
housewife.
JESSE
Okay, no one could EVER do that, all
right? I promise, it would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster than
to turn you into anything submissive.
The whole conversation has taken on a calmer tone.

103.
CELINE
I don't think I've recovered since
giving birth. When they were born,
I had no idea what to do. People
expect women to have instinct that
kicks in, like a female baboon. But
I had no idea how to do anything. I
loved them so much, and I was doing
everything wrong. And you were away
so often, calling me, asking me how
my day went, and I couldn't even say
it to you because I felt so ashamed
for being so clueless.
JESSE
Look, I think you did great.
CELINE
No, I didn't.
JESSE
No, you did. Well, you did a good
job faking it, then.
CELINE
I remember the only way I could get
them to sleep was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs and
walk them for hours and hours in the
middle of the night, all the way to
Pigalle and back. I almost got mugged
once... I mean, the only reason why
the guy didn't attack me was is that
I looked so pathetic. The only upside
of being over 35 is that you don't
get raped as much. I read it - its
true.
Jesse laughs.

The tone shifts.

JESSE
Oh, Jesus.
(he takes her hand)
Once I remember I was watching the
twins on a trampoline, you know, and
they looked so beautiful. And I was
happy because they were happy, you
know. One of them had this hulahoop that she was using as a jump
rope, but then the other one wanted
it so they started fighting over it.
All of a sudden I saw it all, this
petty jealously and selfishness... I
remember thinking: this is the natural
(MORE)

104.
JESSE (CONT'D)
human state - always a little
dissatisfied, perpetually
discontented, you know? I mean,
look at us, here we are, in a garden
of Eden and we can't stop fighting.
CELINE
I don't think there is one natural
human state. The human state is
multiple. If that's what you see
when you're watching the girls play,
that means you're depressed.
Okay.

JESSE
Maybe I am.

Celine is slowly getting revved up again.
CELINE
When I see them fight, I see beautiful
energy of going forward in life and
not letting anyone step on them or
take away what they want. I like it
when they fight - it gives me hope
for them.
JESSE
Well that's because you see anger as
a positive emotion, you know, and
you only end up hurting yourself,
your work, your kids, me.
CELINE
And you never get angry?
JESSE
When I do, I don't see it as a
positive.
CELINE
You know something? The way you
write in your book, people come up
to me and think I make love to some
wildcat Henry Miller type... HA!
You like to have sex the EXACT same
way every time.
JESSE
When you got it, you got it.
CELINE
Kissy, kissy. Titty, titty.
(snoring)

PUSSY.

105.
JESSE
I'm a man of simple pleasures.
CELINE
Yeah, very simple, and I've been
meaning to tell you that lately.
You're no Henry Miller, on any level.
You know what, this room gives me
the creeps, I was expecting something
quaint, like the real Greece.
JESSE
This place is pretty real.
CELINE
What the hell are we doing here
anyway? This is all too planned,
like we're supposed to have this
great evening. There's no room for
spontaneity, it is all gone from our
lives. It's stupid and it's not
working...
Okay.

JESSE
Well, obviously, right?

CELINE
Right, yeah ... and I curse Ariadni
and that perv Stefanos for doing
this. A couples massage - what the
fuck is that? That sounds sleazy to
me.
JESSE
We don't have to do it! Okay? C'mon,
this place isn't so bad. I like
hotel rooms... I think they're sexy.
CELINE
Yeah, I know you do, Mr. Book Tour.
Mr. Radisson Hilton. And I know
that time when you were doing that
reading in Washington, when your
cell phone supposedly broke that
night - how convenient. Swear on
our kids that you didn't fuck that
lady from the bookstore. Emily.
Swear to me you didn't fuck that
Emily girl. And I'm not jealous
because I'm not the jealous type but
I just wanna know, be a man and admit
the truth.

106.
JESSE
I am giving you my whole life, okay?
I've got nothing larger to give.
I'm not giving it to anybody else.
If you're looking for permission to
disqualify me, I'm not going to give
it to you. I love you and I'm NOT
in conflict about it. But if what
you want is a laundry list of all
the things about you that piss me
off, I could give it to you.
CELINE
Yeah - I want to hear.
JESSE
Okay! Well, uh, let's start at number
one - okay, number one, you're fuckin'
nuts, alright? You are, good luck
finding somebody else to put with
your shit for more than like 6 months.
But I accept the whole package, the
crazy and the brilliant. I know
you're not going to change, and I
don't want you to. It's called
accepting you for being you.
CELINE
Yeah okay, I asked you a question.
If, while I was carrying the double
stroller down the stairs and getting
ass-raped in Pigalle, you fucked
that little Emily Bronte girl?
JESSE
Ok I don't know. Emily... what Emily?
What are you even talking about?
CELINE
The one who wrote the nice emails
about Dostoevsky? "Oh Jesse, you're
so right, "The Grand Commander" is
the deepest passage of all Russian
literature."
JESSE
If you're asking me if I'm committed
to you, the girls, and the life we've
built together, the answer is a
resounding YES.
CELINE
So you DID fuck her!
much.

Thank you very

107.
JESSE
Do I ever ask you about the time you
went to go visit your old boyfriend
after his mother died? No. You
want to know why? Because I KNOW
the way that your fucking French ass
works, and I guarantee that you at
least blew that guy, but I also know
that you love me, okay? I'm okay
with you being a complicated human
being! I don't wanna live a boring
life where two people own each other,
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created - because
that is a bunch of stifling bullshit.
Petrified, she exits.
Jesse sits alone waiting for her to return.
Enter Celine.

She walks in, sets her room key down.

CELINE
You know what's going on here? It's
simple - I don't think I love you
anymore.
She exits. Jesse sits there, gazing from the cold cup of
tea, to the door, to the full glasses of wine, to the rumpled,
empty bed. Celine doesn't come back.
EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE/BAR - NIGHT
Jesse finds Celine sitting near the same table where they
saw the sunset earlier.
Miss?

JESSE

CELINE
I don't want to talk right now.
JESSE
Are you by yourself?
for somebody?

Are you waiting

CELINE
Yeah, I'm by myself and happy to be.
I'm an angry person and I hurt my
kids, my work, and everyone I love.
Oh.

JESSE
Well, just my type.

Jesse sits down right across from her.

108.
CELINE
Okay, I'm not in the mood - I came
here to be alone.
JESSE
Yeah, listen. I've just been checking
you out from across the cafe and I
don't want to make you uncomfortable,
but you're by far the best looking
woman in this place.
CELINE
Thank you very much.
JESSE
I'd love to buy you a drink, maybe
talk to you, get to know you a little
bit... you know. Are you here on
business?
Nothing.
Ok..

JESSE (CONT'D)
You have a boyfriend?

Not anymore.

CELINE

JESSE
Sorry to hear that.
to talk about it?

God, you want

CELINE
I don't talk to strangers.
JESSE
But that's the thing, I'm not a
stranger. No, we've met before...
summer '94.
CELINE
You are mistaking me for someone
else.
JESSE
No, we even fell in love.
CELINE
Really? I vaguely remember someone
sweet and romantic, who made me feel
I wasn't alone anymore. Someone who
had respect for who I was.
That's me.

JESSE
I'm that guy.

109.
CELINE
I don't think so.
JESSE
Well, see, I know something about
tonight that you don't know.
Really.

CELINE
What is that?

JESSE
Something important. See, I know
because I've actually already lived
through this night.
How?

CELINE

JESSE
I'm a time traveler.
Okay.

CELINE

JESSE
I have a time machine up in my room.
I've come to save you just like I
said I would.
CELINE
Save me from what?
JESSE
Save you from being blinded by all
the little bullshit of life.
CELINE
It's not bullshit.
JESSE
I assure you, that guy you vaguely
remember, the sweet romantic one who
you met on a train? That is me.
That's you?
Yeah.

CELINE
JESSE

CELINE
Guess I didn't recognize you... you
look like shit.

110.
JESSE
What can I say? I mean, it's tough
out there in time and space. You,
on the other hand are even more
beautiful than I remember.
CELINE
Bullshit! Jesse, this is not a game.
You get all cute, you get in my
panties and the next thing I know,
I'm buying peanut butter in Chicago.
You're not going to make it better
by some little pick up line.
JESSE
I'm not trying to pick you up - no,
no, you misunderstood me. I'm only
here as a messenger. I've just
traveled all the way from the future.
I was just with your 82 year old
self who gave me a letter to read to
you. So here I am.
CELINE
I'm still alive in my 80's?
JESSE
OOOHHHH YEAH.
CELINE
How's my French ass?
Nice.

JESSE
Really nice.

CELINE
I don't care about the way I look.
JESSE
Let's just say, there's even more of
you to love. Okay, do you want me
to read the letter to you?
CELINE
Do I have a choice?
JESSE
Oh sure, I mean, if you're not
interested in what you have to say...
No, no, no.

CELINE
Read it.

111.
JESSE
Okay, here I go. Dear Celine, I'm
writing to you from the other side
of the woods. This letter is lighting
a candle...
CELINE
Okay stop it. I would never write
this - it's too flowery, "Other side
of the woods," what fucking woods?
What're you talking about?
JESSE
May I please continue?
CELINE

Okay.

JESSE
I am sending you this young man.
Yes, young - and he will be your
escort. God knows, he has many
problems and has struggled his whole
life connecting and being present
even with those he loves the most.
And for that he is deeply sorry but you are his only hope. Celine,
my advice to you is this: you are
entering the best years of your life.
Looking back from where I sit now
these middle years are only a little
bit more difficult then when you
were 12 and Mathieu and Vanessa danced
all night to the Bee Gee's "How deep
is your love." Celine, you will be
fine. Your girls will grow up to
become examples and icons of feminism.
Nice one.

CELINE

JESSE
Yeah, well, you know what I just
noticed, there's a Post Script at
the bottom, looks kind of important.
Maybe I should just skip over the
rest of this boring stuff and get to
that?
CELINE
Yeah, skip away. Please, skip away.
Okay.

JESSE
You sure?

112.
Yeah.

CELINE

JESSE
Okay, all right, well.
CELINE
The boring stuff.
Jesse scoots his chair closer to her.
JESSE
Yeah. Okay.
(looks around, lowers
his voice)
Yeah, it's like financial tips,
horoscopes, boring stuff. Okay, here
it is... P.S. By the way, the best
sex of my life happened one night in
the Southern Peloponnese. Don't
miss it. My whole sexual being went
to a new, ground-breaking level.
CELINE
Ground-breaking. Great.
JESSE
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
CELINE
Okay, Jesse, can you stop this stupid
game? We're not in one of your
stories. Okay? Did you hear what I
said to you back in the room? Did
you hear me?
JESSE
Yes, I heard you - that you don't
love me anymore. I figured you didn't
mean it but if you did, then fuck
it. You know something? You're
just like the little girls and
everybody else - you want to live in
some fairy tale. I'm just trying to
make things better here. I tell you
I love you unconditionally, I tell
you that you're beautiful, I tell
you that your ass looks great when
you're 80. I'm trying to make you
laugh. I put up with plenty of your
shit, and if you think I'm just some
dog who's gonna keep coming back
then, you're wrong. But if you want
true love - this is it.
(MORE)

113.
JESSE (CONT'D)
This is real life. It's not perfect,
but it's real. And if you can't see
it, then you're blind, alright? I
give up.
Jesse crumples up the napkin/letter he was reading from and
tosses it on the table. What follows is a lengthy silent
sequence where they just sort of stare at each other,
seemingly going through everything past and present.
CELINE
So what about this time machine?
JESSE
What do you mean?
CELINE
How does it work?
JESSE
Well... it's complicated.
CELINE
Am I going to have to get naked to
operate it?
Jesse's mood shifts, and the camera starts to slowly pull
away from them as they continue talking.
JESSE
Yeah, actually. Yeah, it's been a
real issue, you know, clothes don't
travel well through the whole spacetime continuum.
CELINE
(bimbo voice)
Wow. You're so smart.
Oh, Jesus.

JESSE

CELINE
Space-time...?
Continuum.
'Continuum.'
Yeah.

JESSE
CELINE
JESSE

114.
Wow.

CELINE

JESSE
You know, there's something I have
been thinking about, about your
letter. You mention something about
the southern Peloponesse? We're in
the southern Peloponesse.
Yeah?

CELINE

JESSE
Do you think it could be tonight
that you're still talking about in
your 80s?
CELINE
Well, it must have been one hell of
a night we're about to have.
The camera has now pulled far away and the conversation has
become inaudible. We leave them as just another couple
sitting and talking at a table on a beautiful night on the
coast of Greece.
FADE OUT
