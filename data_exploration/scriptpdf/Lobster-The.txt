EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
A WOMAN drives. She is on a country road, with fields on
either side. She reaches a deserted spot where three donkeys
stand on the right side of the road. The woman pulls over,
puts on a pair of gloves, gets out of the car, checks to see
if there is anyone nearby or if she is being watched, runs
towards the donkeys, shoots one of them many times over, runs
back to the car and drives away.
OPENING CREDITS.
I. THE TOWN

INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING
A MAN around 45 years old, DAVID, sits on a sofa. His WIFE,
around 40 years old, stands and leans against a bookcase.
David is shortsighted and wears glasses. His wife also wears
glasses. Next to David lies a DOG, an Alsatian. David is
crying. The woman is not.
DAVID’S WIFE
I’m really sorry.
(Pause)
DAVID
Does he wear glasses or contact
lenses?
Glasses.

DAVID’S WIFE

(Pause)
David doesn’t look at her. He stares at the floor. He swivels
a glass of grapefruit juice on the table with his hand.
David’s wife seems sad. She looks at her watch a couple of
times. She hesitates, but finally talks.
DAVID’S WIFE (CONT’D)
You’ll have to hurry up. They'll be
here quite soon.
David leaves the room. As he goes up the stairs to the
bedroom, his wife keeps talking to him.
DAVID’S WIFE (CONT’D)
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find
the right woman really soon. A
woman of average shortsightedness,
just like you.

INT. TOWN HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
David picks out clothes from the wardrobe and gets dressed.
His movements are slow and unhurried, as if he doesn’t want
these final preparations to end. He stares at his slippers
next to the bed. He decides not to take them with him.
FEMALE V.O.
He decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.
He went down the stairs into the
sitting room. There he saw the
other man for the first and last
time. He was very handsome.

4

INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING
David goes down the stairs that lead to the sitting room. In
the sitting room sits a MAN who is not handsome. He too is
shortsighted and wears glasses. He eats a tuna-mayonnaise
sandwich.
FEMALE V.O.
He was eating a tuna-mayonnaise
sandwich and wearing a pair of
black lace-up shoes. She was in the
kitchen. David sat in the armchair
and looked at his watch. His wife
entered the room and left a glass
of Coca-Cola Light for the man
eating the sandwich and then went
to the window.

5

INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING
David sits in the armchair. The two men do not look at or
talk to each other. The woman enters holding a glass of CocaCola with ice and a slice of lemon. She leaves the glass in
front of the man eating the sandwich and then goes over to
David. She looks at her watch and then out the window.
Everyone waits in silence. They all avoid making eye contact.
David grabs a coffee table book from the coffee table next to
him. He flicks through the pages quickly, looking at the
pictures without any real interest. He just goes through the
motions. The dog sits next to him.
FEMALE V.O.
David picked up a book called “The
Most Famous Lighthouses in the
World” and pretended to read. He
was thinking his wife didn’t love
him at all anymore. He didn’t burst
into tears and he didn’t stop to
think that the first thing most
people do when they realise someone
doesn’t love them anymore is cry.

3.
The doorbell rings. The woman gets up and answers the door.
Two men dressed as WAITERS enter.
50-YEAR-OLD WAITER
Good afternoon.
DAVID’S WIFE
Good afternoon.
50-YEAR-OLD WAITER
Which of these two gentlemen is the
one you’re breaking up with?
DAVID’S WIFE
Not the man eating the sandwich.
The man with the brown shoes.
David gets up. His wife goes over to him. He closes the book
and leaves it on the table.
DAVID’S WIFE (CONT’D)
You can take the book with you, if
you like.
DAVID
No, that’s okay.
He buttons up his jacket and fixes his hair with his hands.
DAVID’S WIFE
Are you ready? Did you pack that
pain relief cream for your back?
Yes.

DAVID

DAVID’S WIFE
You’re healthy, you have many
interests, you have good taste.
Everything will be fine.
David looks at the waiters.
I’m ready.

DAVID

EXT. TOWN ROAD - MORNING
The waiters lead David to a coach. The dog follows them and
gets into the vehicle with David.

7

EXT. HOTEL COACH - MORNING
There are another four people sitting on the coach. Two
WOMEN, a BALD MAN and a BLOND MAN. They all sit in different
parts of the coach. David takes a window seat.

4.
The waiters sit together behind the WAITER-DRIVER. One of the
two women gets up from her seat and goes over to where David
sits. She looks at the dog and smiles at him but does not
stroke him. She looks a little afraid of him. She strokes the
dog above his hind legs, as far from the animal’s mouth as
possible.
BISCUIT WOMAN
Your dog is so beautiful. What’s
his name?
Bob.

DAVID

BISCUIT WOMAN
Hello, Bob. I’m Anna. I love dogs
so much. I’m sure Bob senses this
and knows that we’re going to get
along famously. I’ve heard the
journey takes over an hour. I’ve
got butter biscuits and hazelnuts
in my bag. I can give you some if
you’re hungry. I mean, we can share
them. I can give the dog some
hazelnuts too, or a biscuit.
One of the waiters gets up from his seat and goes over to the
woman.
30-YEAR-OLD WAITER
I’m afraid you’ll have to return to
your seat until we reach our
destination.
BISCUIT WOMAN
I see. How long will that be,
roughly?
50-YEAR-OLD WAITER
The journey lasts a little over an
hour.
The woman goes back to her seat. She opens her bag and eats a
butter biscuit. She takes a quick look around at the other
people in the vehicle.
8

INT. HOTEL COACH - MORNING
David looks out the window. They have left the town and there
are some woods beside the road. Suddenly a rock hits the
window. David is a little shocked. He notices that the
waiters do not react. David sees some people wearing ponchos
running alongside the coach. They are shouting but we cannot
hear what they are saying. More rocks strike the vehicle. The
driver speeds up and gets away. He is completely unfazed by
the incident.

5.
9

EXT. HOTEL CARPARK - MORNING
The coach goes through the hotel gates and comes to a stop.
The gates are opened by TWO WAITER-GUARDS, who wave to the
driver. The waiters have automatic rifles slung across their
backs. The hotel is a large building surrounded by a tall
fence. It looks quite well-maintained and clean. The plants
are in excellent condition and it is immediately clear that
this is one of those large hotel complexes that can
accommodate a large number of guests. At the entrance, the
flags of various countries fly on tall poles. A number of
people stand and watch from the room balconies. One of them
waves. Biscuit Woman, filled with optimism, waves back. The
passengers get off the coach. The two waiters lead them to
the entrance in a line. Blond Man is slow and falls behind
because of his limp. We will call him LIMPING MAN from now
on.
II. THE HOTEL NEAR THE TOWN

10

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
The hotel lobby is empty. There is nobody around apart from
the RECEPTIONIST. On the walls are various classic-looking
paintings, all of which show couples in a characteristic
pose: the man seated in an armchair with the woman standing
by his side. There are also some paintings, again in a
classic style, of animals, such as a horse, a duck or some
other bird. The receptionist is a young woman with a friendly
face and a calm voice. Biscuit Woman and the other woman,
David, Limping Man and the Bald Man stand in front of the
reception desk.
RECEPTIONIST
Welcome. Have any of you stayed in
the hotel before?
I have.

BISCUIT WOMAN

RECEPTIONIST
Excellent. Then you know the rules.
If you like, you can wait in the
lobby. You’ll find today’s papers,
and we can bring you tea or coffee
or a soft drink.
BISCUIT WOMAN
I’d like to hear the rules again,
if you don’t mind. I mean, it’s
been ten years since I was last
here and I’ve forgotten a number of
things. Like the bit with the days
where you hunt the people in the
woods with a bow and arrow, the
night of the slaughter and so on.

6.
RECEPTIONIST
Some things have changed. We use
tranquilliser guns now instead of
bows and arrows and the night of
the slaughter has been done away
with. I’ll go over everything again
with you. I don’t mind at all.
BISCUIT WOMAN
Does Toby still work here?
RECEPTIONIST
Who’s Toby?
BISCUIT WOMAN
Toby. The outdoor bar waiter.
RECEPTIONIST
I don’t know. You’ll have to ask
one of the outdoor bar staff. I’d
like you all to form a line. I
suggest the gentlemen allow the
ladies to go first, although this
isn’t compulsory. You can sort this
out amongst yourselves.
The gentlemen allow the ladies to go first.
11

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING
David is the last to be served. He keeps hold of the Alsatian
with one hand and rests his other hand on the reception desk.
The dog seems anxious, and barks. David tries to calm it down
but doesn’t succeed. The dog barks throughout the exchange
that follows.
RECEPTIONIST
Well, sir, you said you’ve never
been on your own before, correct?
No, never.

DAVID

The receptionist fills in a form.
RECEPTIONIST
Are you allergic to any foods?
No.

DAVID

RECEPTIONIST
Your last relationship lasted how
many years?
DAVID
Around twelve.

7.
RECEPTIONIST
Do you remember how long exactly?
David tries to calm and quieten the dog but fails.
DAVID
Eleven years and one month.
RECEPTIONIST
Any children?
No.

DAVID

RECEPTIONIST
And the dog?
DAVID
My brother. He was here a couple of
years ago but he didn't make it.
You might remember him. Medium
build, 48 years old, bald patch,
blond.
RECEPTIONIST
I'm afraid not, sir. Okay, now I’d
like you to write your name clearly
on this form.
She hands him the form to fill in.
RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
In capital letters.
We see the golf course and squash courts, empty. On a
basketball court we see a MAN and a WOMAN playing one on one.
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) (CONT’D)
You’re not allowed to use the
basketball or volleyball courts,
these are only for the couples. You
can use the facilities for
individual sports, such as squash
and golf.
At the hotel bar, the BARMAN mixes a cocktail. Someone is
drinking alone.
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) (CONT’D)
You can stay in the hotel for up to
45 days. You'll be staying in a
single room. If everything goes
well and you make it, you’ll be
moved to a double room. Every
Saturday there's a dance in the
main hall. You're in luck, because
tomorrow's Saturday. Here’s a
leaflet with the hotel rules.
(MORE)

8.
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I’d like you to read it carefully
and if you have any questions,
don't hesitate to ask me for help.
In the hotel kitchen, WAITERS wash the dishes. They then lay
out a buffet. One of the waiters has dirtied his shirt.
Another sprays his shirt with stain-removal fluid, waits for
it to dry and then wipes at the stain with a cloth.
Thank you.

DAVID

RECEPTIONIST
You're in Room 101. You should
always keep the dog there. You’re
excused from today’s programme, so
you can spend the rest of the day
however you like.
12

INT. HOTEL RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
A large room, most of which is empty. In one corner of the
room are four desks arranged in a row with some chairs. David
gets undressed. He leaves his clothes with a WAITER and a
MAID, who store them in a box. Sitting on chairs in just
their underwear are the rest of the people who arrived with
David on the coach.
Shoe size?

MAID

DAVID
44 and a half.
MAID
44 or 45. There are no half sizes.
45.

DAVID

They give him a pair of black shoes, a pair of brown shoes
and a pair of flip flops.
MAID
Please pick a CD for the sound
system in your room.
There are four CDs to choose from, their titles handwritten
on their cases: BEST EVER LOVE SONGS VOL. I, BEST EVER LOVE
SONGS VOL. II, BEST EVER LOVE SONGS VOL. III, and BEST EVER
LOVE SONGS VOL. IV. David pauses to think.
DAVID
Volume three, please.

9.
MAID
If you need a haircut, call
reception one day ahead. Smoking is
not allowed. That way you’ll be
able to run for longer during the
hunt without getting tired and your
breath won’t smell when you kiss.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.

DAVID

BISCUIT WOMAN
Excuse me, if we need a haircut we
must call reception for an
appointment the day before?
MAID
That’s right.
Great.
13

BISCUIT WOMAN

INT. ROOM 101 - MORNING
The room is typical of a nice hotel. It has a single bed, a
single chair beside a small table and a teacup upturned on
its saucer on the table. The floor is carpeted.
FEMALE V.O.
His room number was 101. A
tranquilliser gun was hanging on
the wall above his bed. On the
bedside table were 20 tranquilliser
darts.
We watch David enter the room in just his underwear. He holds
the dog by its leash. David looks around the room: a single
bed and a wardrobe beside it. Hanging on the wall above the
bed is a tranquilliser gun. There are tranquilliser darts on
the bedside table. David takes the leash off the dog and
looks around.
FEMALE V.O. (CONT’D)
Inside the wardrobe were four
identical khaki chino trousers,
four identical claret polo shirts,
a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer,
four sky-blue shirts, a striped
tie, a black plastic watch, a pair
of sunglasses, a white bathrobe and
Acqua di Parma cologne for men. He
thought they most probably give the
women the same cologne but for
women. Maybe the man with the bad
leg could become his friend.
(MORE)

10.
FEMALE V.O. (CONT’D)
But not if he was courting the same
woman he was. Then they’d surely
fight, he thought. He’d never reach
the point where he’d kill him but
they’d fight, that’s for sure.
David opens the wardrobe. Inside the wardrobe are four
identical khaki chino trousers, four identical polo shirts, a
belt, socks, underwear, a blazer, four sky-blue shirts, a
striped tie, a black plastic watch, a pair of sunglasses, a
white bathrobe and Acqua di Parma cologne for men. David sits
down on the edge of the bed. He reads the leaflet. The dog
looks out the window.
14

INT. ROOM 101 - MORNING
David looks out the window. The coach pulls up outside the
hotel entrance. Men and women, residents of the hotel, climb
out of the coach carrying unconscious people. They dump the
limp bodies next to a WAITER, who counts them, and the Maid
takes notes in a folder. The phone rings. David answers it.
Yes?

DAVID

BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
Good afternoon.
DAVID
Good afternoon.
BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
I’m calling from Room 180. I’m 45
years old but I look 40 because I
follow a healthy diet and I’ve
worked out ever since I was young.
How about you?
David answers, but hasn’t yet figured out who he’s talking
to.
DAVID
I’m 45 years old too.
BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
How was your day?
Fine.

DAVID

The dog barks.
BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
You have a dog?
Yes.

DAVID

11.
BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
I love dogs very much and they take
to me right away. I think we’re
going to get along famously. Do you
like butter biscuits?
Now he gets it.
Yes.

DAVID

BISCUIT WOMAN (O.S.)
I don’t just like them, I like them
a lot. Let’s have tea or coffee
sometime with biscuits. You sound
like a very interesting person.
Feel free to call me whenever you
like, morning or night, until 10
o’clock. If I don’t answer, try
again. I take these pills for my
thyroid gland, they told me they
might make me drowsy. My room
number is 180, so my phone number
is 180. I have to go now because
I’m feeling sleepy. We’ll talk
later. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

DAVID

He hangs up and stands there staring at the phone for a
minute.
15

INT. ROOM 101 - EVENING
David sleeps in his clothes on the bed. The dog sleeps on the
floor. There is a knock at the door. David wakes up, fixes
his hair a little and answers the door. The HOTEL MANAGER and
her HUSBAND enter. The Waiter and the Maid who were handing
out shoes to the new guests follow them in. The Hotel Manager
is a woman of around 55. She is dressed formally and her hair
is carefully styled. Almost like a sculpture.
HOTEL MANAGER
Welcome. I am the Hotel Manager and
this gentleman is my partner.
You’re one of the lucky ones
because your room is one of our
superior rooms. That means it has a
view.
The Hotel Manager sits on the only chair and her partner
stands beside her. They resemble the paintings on the lobby
wall, only in reverse.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Did you read the leaflet?

12.
DAVID
I did, yes.
HOTEL MANAGER
Very good. The fact that you'll
turn into an animal if you don't
manage to fall in love with another
person during your stay here is not
something that should upset you, or
get you down. Just think, as an
animal you'll have a second chance
to find a companion. But even then
you must be very careful. You'll
need to find a companion who is the
same type of animal as you are. A
wolf and a penguin could never live
together, nor could a camel with a
hippopotamus. That would be absurd.
Think about it. But there are
certain combinations in particular
that are worst of all - for example
a bear with a fish, or a lion with
an antelope, or a fox with a
chicken. I realise that this
discussion is a little unpleasant
for you but I have a duty to
prepare you psychologically for
every possible outcome. Have you
decided what animal you would like
to be if you end up alone?
A lobster.

DAVID

HOTEL MANAGER
Why a lobster?
David seems to have thought this through rather well.
DAVID
Because a lobster lives to be over
100 years old, has blue blood just
like an aristocrat and stays
fertile all its life. And I like
the sea very much. I water-ski and
swim quite well, ever since I was a
teenager.
HOTEL MANAGER
I must congratulate you. Usually
the first thing people think of is
a dog and that’s why the world is
full of dogs. Very few choose to
become unusual animals, which is
why they are endangered.
(MORE)

13.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT'D)
Rarely does someone choose to be a
tuna fish, due to the dangers it
faces, or a polar bear, due to its
adverse living conditions. A
lobster is an excellent choice. One
more thing, before we leave.
The Hotel Manager signals to the Waiter and the Maid. They
take David’s arm, twist it behind his back and bring out a
special leather accessory consisting of a belt and a bracelet
linked together. They fasten the belt around his waist and
the bracelet around his wrist, so that his hand is held tight
behind his back and he cannot move his arm. The belt buckle
in front is then locked with a small key, so that he cannot
take it off.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
This is so you see how easy life is
when there are two of something
instead of just one. We forget this
from time to time. The handcuff
will be removed at the same time
tomorrow. But that’s enough for
today. I imagine it was a trying
day. Good evening and enjoy your
stay.
They leave and close the door behind them. David looks down
at the belt and bracelet.
16

INT. ROOM 101 - NIGHT
David has placed his toothbrush on the bathroom sink and
tries to squeeze toothpaste onto it. He then tries to screw
the plastic cap back onto the toothpaste tube, and fails over
and over again. He finally brushes his teeth.

17

INT. ROOM 101 - NIGHT
David stands beside his bed. He tries to pull off his
trousers with the belt still on in order to free his hand. He
struggles. He lies down, sucks in his belly and pushes his
trousers down. After much effort, he manages to free one leg.

18

INT. ROOM 101 - MORNING
David sleeps in his underwear. He has managed to take his
trousers off, which are still attached to his wrist by the
bracelet. He is woken up by the music of a very well-known
love song, “A Groovy Kind of Love” by Phil Collins. He looks
at his watch. David gets up and sits on the side of the bed.
He fixes his hair with both hands, lifting up the trousers on
his wrist as he does so. He puts some water in a plate for
the dog.

14.
19

INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING
David enters the breakfast room wearing his trousers as
normal. The breakfast room is very tidy and clean. David
walks quickly, trying to find an empty table to sit at.
Everybody looks at him as he walks by. He looks straight
ahead the whole time. All the men wear the same clothes. All
the women do too. They all sit alone. There is only one chair
at each table in the room. He sees Limping Man, who was with
him on the coach. He too has his arm tied behind his back.
All the new arrivals wear this same accessory.
FEMALE V.O.
His first day was one he would
never forget so long as he lived.
Beside the window opposite his
table at breakfast sat a young
woman with her head tilted back.
Later he would learn that she often
got nosebleeds. Next to her sat her
best friend. Near the door, the
woman who was with him on the coach
offered a biscuit to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.
He then looked behind him and saw a
man and a woman he would meet in
due course, and some others he
would never meet during his stay at
the hotel.
We see NOSEBLEED WOMAN, her BEST FRIEND who stares at her,
Biscuit Woman (with one hand tied behind her back), CAMPARI
MAN, LISPING MAN and HEARTLESS WOMAN, characters we will get
to know later. Lisping Man is around 50 years old and
Heartless Woman is around 35 and very beautiful. David
spreads butter and marmalade on a slice of bread with one
hand and eats. Limping Man and Lisping Man come up to his
table.
LIMPING MAN
I’ve decided to go for a walk
outside with my new friend. Let me
introduce you. This is Robert, he
stays in the room next to mine and
has a lisp.
David puts down his cup of coffee and offers his hand to
Lisping Man. They shake hands.
DAVID
Pleased to meet you. I’m staying in
Room 101.
LIMPING MAN
Would you like to join us?
Why not.

DAVID

15.
20

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Limping Man, David and Lisping Man sit on the beach. Three
yachts are moored at the pier in front of them. The pier is
guarded by TWO ARMED WAITERS.
LISPING MAN
She’s much older than he is, you
know that right?
Yes.
Yes.

DAVID
LIMPING MAN

LISPING MAN
When Melanie was with Don, I could
understand what brought them
together clearly. He was more her
age and their hair colour really
matched as they were both
strawberry blond. But now with
Antonio it’s really strange, it
doesn’t really make sense. I mean,
he’s much darker than she is and,
as you know, much younger.
LIMPING MAN
Maybe there’s something we don’t
know. I’ve heard he has his own
business, he sells this aftershave,
you know, named after himself.
DAVID
Maybe she has an aftershave or a
cologne named after her too.
LISPING MAN
Maybe. I don’t know. What I do know
is that these two are a shining
example to us all. Whenever I feel
down, I think of these two and tell
myself that I’m going to make it,
that everything’s going to be
alright. I keep hold of this
thought and I know that my days at
this place are numbered. One of
these days it’s going to be me on
one of those three yachts.
21

INT. LECTURE HALL - MIDDAY
The new arrivals at the hotel sit on four chairs on stage.
David sits last in line. There is a wireless microphone which
they each take to speak. Behind the podium stands the Hotel
Manager. Her husband stands beside, and a little behind her.

16.
All the residents attending the event are sitting very
quietly. The hall is half empty. Waiters and Maids stand
randomly around the room, in pairs.
HOTEL MANAGER
Room 206, Day 2.
LIMPING MAN
Hello, everyone.
LIMPING MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
My mother was left on her own when
my father fell in love with a woman
who was better at maths than she
was. She had a postgraduate degree
I think, whereas my mother was only
a graduate.
22

EXT. ZOO - DAY
We see Limping Man walking normally, without a limp, in a zoo
and holding a carrier bag. He passes various caged animals
and reaches the wolf enclosure. He takes pieces of raw meat
out of the bag and throws them into the enclosure at various
places. The wolves draw close.
LIMPING MAN (V.O.)
I was sixteen at the time. My
mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.
I really missed her. I found out
she'd been moved to a zoo. I often
went there to see her. I'd give her
raw meat, I knew wolves liked raw
meat but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,
so I used to give a little bit to
each of them.
Limping Man climbs up the enclosure fence. The wolves come
over to where the man is. Only two wolves stand motionless
and watch from a corner of the enclosure.
LIMPING MAN (V.O.)
One day I decided to enter the
enclosure. I really missed her and
I wanted a hug. I climbed the fence
and jumped in. All the wolves
charged at once and attacked me.
All but two, who stood motionless.
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother. The zoo
guards got to me quite quickly and
took me to the hospital. Thankfully
I didn't lose my leg, I just have
this limp, which is also my
defining characteristic.
(MORE)

17.
LIMPING MAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My wife died six days ago. She was
very beautiful and I loved her very
much. She had a limp too.
We see a zoo guard hosing down the blood in the wolf
enclosure. A tiger sleeps in the next cage.
23

INT. LECTURE HALL - MIDDAY
The audience applauds. Some stand. The waiters also clap. The
Hotel Manager waits for the applause to peter out.
HOTEL MANAGER
Reference letters. 1 - “He is very
sensitive and a very good friend. I
lent him money in 1989 and he paid
me back before the repayment date.”
2 - “John is wonderful. He loves
kids and is a first-class
conversationalist.” Let’s move on
to our next guest. Room 104, Day 2.
GUEST FROM ROOM 104
Hello, everyone. This is only my
second day here but already I feel
like a member of a wonderful group.
My defining characteristic is that
I have a very beautiful face.
The guest from Room 104 does not have a very beautiful face.

24

INT. BALLROOM - EVENING
A big room, cheerfully decorated. Instrumental music plays.
Some strobe lights hang from the ceiling and there are two
tables laden with sandwiches and refreshments. Couples dance.
Two women sit at a table: Nosebleed Woman and her Best
Friend. A woman sits on her own at the next table. She is the
Heartless Woman we saw at breakfast. Biscuit Woman enters and
goes over to her table.
BISCUIT WOMAN
May I join you?
HEARTLESS WOMAN
No, you may not. And don’t you dare
come near my table again.
I’m sorry.

BISCUIT WOMAN

Biscuit Woman goes to the table where Nosebleed Woman and her
Best Friend sit.
BISCUIT WOMAN (CONT’D)
Can I sit with you?

18.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
Of course. You are third in line.
I’m first, then it’s my best
friend, then you.
BISCUIT WOMAN
Thank you very much.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
She has no feelings whatsoever.
Feels nothing at all. Just be
careful around her, keep your
distance. Understood?
Okay.

BISCUIT WOMAN

NOSEBLEED WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND
She’s the best hunter in the hotel.
Silent and very fast. She’s the
women’s record holder. 192
captives.
BISCUIT WOMAN
Who’s the men’s record holder?
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
An assistant university professor.
He’s not at the hotel any more. He
left in 2009 after a year here. 282
captives.
David approaches their table.
DAVID
Who’s first?
I am.

NOSEBLEED WOMAN

They go to dance. Romantic instrumental music plays. There
are around ten couples on the dance floor. Limping Man dances
with a woman next to them and Lisping Man dances towards the
back. Next to them, the Hotel Manager dances with her
partner. She smiles at him. He smiles back at her, trying to
be polite. Nosebleed Woman’s nose starts to bleed, staining
David’s shirt.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I’ve got blood on you.
But don’t worry. There are many
ways to remove blood stains from
clothes quite easily. One is to
wash the item in cold water and
then rub it with sea salt. Another
is to scrub the stains with cotton
wool dipped in ammonia.
(MORE)

19.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN (CONT’D)
The third way is to use water and
flour mixed into a paste, like
toothpaste, especially if the
clothes are delicate or brightly
coloured. But never use hot water
on blood. Ever.
David doesn’t seem to mind much. An alarm goes off. They all
run from the ballroom.
25

INT. ROOM 101 - EVENING
David quickly enters his room. He takes the tranquilliser gun
off the wall and loads it. He leaves the room. The dog looks
at him but doesn’t react.

26

INT. HOTEL COACH - EVENING
David gets into the coach with the others and sits next to
Limping Man, who seems very nervous.
LIMPING MAN
I wish I didn’t have this limp. I
used to be very good at running but
not anymore. I’m sure I’ll be
slower than them.
DAVID
If I were you, I’d think of some
tricks that use the element of
surprise instead of speed.
LIMPING MAN
You’re right. That’s what I’ll do.
A glimmer of hope lights his face.

27

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
We see male and female residents of the hotel get off the
coach armed with their tranquilliser guns. They run off,
holding powerful torches, in different directions to hunt
LONERS who live in the woods. Some seem really excited.
Others look bored. The waiters get off the coach and stand in
front of the vehicle. The driver switches off the coach
headlights.

28

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Limping Man struggles to run. He tries to climb some rocks
but doesn’t manage it.

20.
29

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Heartless Woman spots a YOUNG LONER WOMAN picking and eating
nuts off a tree. The Young Loner Woman notices her and starts
to run. Heartless Woman chases after her. After a hard chase
she catches her and beats her into unconsciousness, then gets
up and shoots her with the tranquilliser gun as well.

30

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
TWO HOTEL GUESTS stand over the UNCONSCIOUS BODY of a loner.
They both start to drag the body away in different
directions. They then stop and hit each other.

31

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
David spots a LONER MAN in the distance trying to hide. He
takes aim with his gun, shoots and misses. The Loner Man
notices him and starts to run. David starts shooting over and
over again. He misses and runs after him. After a while David
stops, out of breath. He realises he’s also out of
tranquilliser darts. He sits on a rock. He looks at his
watch.

32

EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - EVENING
The hotel guests are lined up in front of the coach. Some of
them have unconscious bodies of loners beside them. The Maid
holding a folder goes to each hotel guest in turn and
announces to them how many extra days’ stay at the hotel they
have earned based on the number of loners they have captured.
She first shines a light in their faces and then on the
bodies beside each guest. She comes first to Lisping Man.
MAID
Room 186, one loner, one extra day.
38 days’ stay left, plus one, 39.
She then goes to Heartless Woman.
MAID (CONT’D)
Room 290, four loners, four extra
days. 154 days’ stay left, plus
four, 158.
Next is Limping Man.
MAID (CONT’D)
Room 206. The days of your stay
remain unchanged.
She then goes to David. He has taken no prisoners.

21.
MAID (CONT’D)
Room 101. The days of your stay
remain unchanged.
The Maid moves on.
Room 302?

MAID (CONT’D)

One of the waiters who escorted the hotel guests to the hunt
answers her.
WARDEN WAITER
He never returned. Either he was
lost in the woods, was captured or…
he escaped.
MAID
If he doesn’t show up by noon
tomorrow, arrange for Room 302 to
be cleaned and prepared.
Alright.
33

WARDEN WAITER

EXT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING
David sits alone at a table. He drinks milk. Behind him the
Hotel Manager, a waiter and the Maid are speaking with
Lisping Man. We cannot see him. We can only hear him.
HOTEL MANAGER
Are you the man in Room 186?
I am, yes.

LISPING MAN

HOTEL MANAGER
I imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted in
the rooms or in any other area of
the hotel.
Yes.

LISPING MAN

HOTEL MANAGER
And yet it has been brought to my
attention that you continue to do
it. [To the Maid] Had he ejaculated
when you found him?
MAID
We don’t know. There was water
everywhere in the bathroom because
he’d just had a shower, so we
couldn’t tell.

22.
HOTEL MANAGER
Were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating?
Yes.

LISPING MAN

HOTEL MANAGER
What did the photograph show?
LISPING MAN
A naked woman on a horse in the
country.
HOTEL MANAGER
Do you have it with you?
LISPING MAN
No. It’s in my room.
HOTEL MANAGER
If I were in your shoes I wouldn’t
be ogling the naked woman but the
horse. I’m sure that horse used to
be a weak and cowardly man, just
like you.
Lisping Man does not reply. We then hear screams.
LISPING MAN
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
David pours some more milk from the bottle into his glass.
His eyes don’t move. He doesn’t glance back. He looks down at
his hand. He stares at it, trying to see if it’s trembling.
He looks up and then back down at his hand again.
34

INT. LECTURE HALL - EVENING
The Maid and the 50-Year-Old Waiter stand in the middle of
the stage. The hotel guests sit and watch. The Hotel Manager
talks to the audience with a microphone. Besides her stands
her partner, as usual.
HOTEL MANAGER
Good evening, everyone. With the
help of this reenactment, we’d like
to show you what it’s like when
someone lives on their own and what
it’s like when they live with
someone else.
One. Man eats alone.
The 50-Year-Old Waiter opens a folding table on stage and
places a plate on it. He pretends to eat and then suddenly
chokes, falls off his chair and pretends to die.

23.
He then gets up and sits back down on his chair. This time
the Maid sits opposite him.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Two. Man eats with woman.
The 50-Year-Old Waiter again pretends to eat and choke but
this time the Maid gets up, performs the Heimlich manoeuver
on him and he recovers. They then hug.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Three. Woman walks alone.
The Maid walks across the stage. A WAITER-EXTRA stands in the
middle of the stage, blocks her path, pulls down his trousers
and pretends to rape her.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Four. Woman walks with man.
The 50-Year-Old Waiter and the Maid walk together across the
stage and pass in front of the rapist waiter. Nothing
happens. The audience applauds.
35

INT. ROOM 101 - MIDDAY
David throws a ball for his dog to fetch. The dog looks very
happy. David doesn’t praise the dog when it brings the ball
back. The phone rings.
DAVID
Hello? Yes, send them up. Thank
you.
David goes to the bathroom and looks at himself in the
mirror. He washes his face and brushes his teeth in a rush.
Someone knocks on the door. David opens the door. An ELDERLY
COUPLE stand outside. They are his parents. He is hugged
first by his father, then by his mother. His mother then hugs
the dog.
DAVID’S MOTHER
Easy now, darling. Look at how he
wags his tail when he looks at his
father. Where’s your father? Go to
your father.
The dog doesn’t move. His father goes to him and strokes him.
DAVID’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Look at him. He’s wagging his tail.
That’s what dogs do when they’re
happy.
They sit on the edge of the bed.

24.
DAVID’S FATHER
This is a very nice room.
DAVID
It’s one of their superior rooms.
It has a very nice view. Go to the
window and take a look.
DAVID’S FATHER
It’s really a very nice view.
DAVID
Mother, go and take a look too.
DAVID’S MOTHER
Really very nice.
DAVID
Would you like something to drink?
I can call room service and order
anything you like.
DAVID’S MOTHER
I’d like a glass of sparkling
water.
DAVID’S FATHER
The same for me. That’s a lovely
idea.
They sit back down. David calls room service and orders the
water.
DAVID’S FATHER (CONT’D)
It’s tragic what’s happened to you
but I think everything will be
alright in the end. We’re both very
optimistic. You have another 26
days. That’s three weeks. What am I
talking about, that’s more than
three weeks. You should get a
haircut as soon as you can. You’re
much more handsome with your hair
short. Your sister sends her
regards. She said she’d visit you
the first chance she gets. She’s in
Switzerland with Mark. They’re
having a wonderful time. Skiing all
day. Mark didn’t know how to ski
but he’s doing very well. He
managed to ski down the whole piste
all by himself on Monday. Your
mother told them that they have to
be careful though. Skiing’s no
laughing matter. You can easily get
hurt.

25.
His parents drink the sparkling water they ordered, down in
one go. They then get up and put on their coats. They say
their goodbyes at the door.
DAVID’S FATHER (CONT’D)
We’ll come again soon.
DAVID’S MOTHER
We’ll come again soon. Give this to
your brother. It’s sirloin steak.
Okay.

DAVID

David closes the door and continues to play with the dog and
the small ball.
36

INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING
Limping Man and David sit alone but at adjacent tables and
eat their breakfast. Limping Man looks a little sad. David
tries to cheer him up.
DAVID
New guests arrived yesterday.
LIMPING MAN
Yes, I saw that.
DAVID
I think I saw a woman with a limp.
LIMPING MAN
It’s only a sprained ankle. She’ll
be walking normally again in a few
days. I asked her.
DAVID
That’s a shame.
Limping Man looks back down at his plate and plays with some
butter and his knife. David tries to find something to say
but can’t. They sit silently. The alarm bell goes off. They
all get up and leave the room.

37

INT. HOTEL COACH - MORNING
David sits in a seat and looks out the window.
FEMALE V.O.
One day he sat next to the woman
with the biscuits on the coach. He
gazed out the window, not looking
at anything in particular, just
trying to avoid talking to her.

26.
Biscuit Woman sits beside him.
How’s Bob?
He’s fine.

BISCUIT WOMAN
DAVID

David tries to be polite but the pretence is obvious.
Although she bores him, he feels sorry for her for some
reason.
BISCUIT WOMAN
I’d give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.
DAVID
The dog’s not allowed out of the
room, I’m afraid.
FEMALE V.O.
There are some excuses that no-one
can argue with, he thought. Some
excuses are without doubt better
than others. And that was a really
good one.
BISCUIT WOMAN
These biscuits are for Bob. I want
you to give them to him whenever
you want to reward him for
something and tell him they’re from
me.
Thank you.

DAVID

He looks out the window again. She doesn’t give up though.
BISCUIT WOMAN
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat? I could give you a blow
job or you could fuck me. I always
swallow after fellatio and I have
absolutely no problem with anal
sex, if that’s your thing. My exhusband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he’d ever
seen in his life but let’s not talk
about him. I’m in Room 180. My
telephone extension number is 180.
I hope I catch some loners today
because I didn’t catch any the last
few times. I hope you catch lots
too.
DAVID
Thank you very much.

27.
BISCUIT WOMAN
If I don’t find a suitable partner
soon I’m going to kill myself by
jumping from one of the room
balconies. I want you to know that.
My room is on the first floor. Room
numbers that start with a “1” are
on the first floor, those starting
with a “2” are on the second floor
and so on. So 140 is on the first
floor and 308 is on the third floor
and 190 is also on the first floor.
So I’ll have to jump from some room
that’s high up. 380, for example,
or 420, that would be even better.
FEMALE V.O.
When she stopped talking, he stared
at her blankly, not knowing what to
say. He then opened the window,
looked out at the woods and thought
once more about how good his excuse
had been.
38

EXT. THE WOODS - MIDDAY
Lisping Man walks carefully through the woods. In the
background we see a few hotel residents firing their
tranquilliser guns and some loners running away. The animals
in the woods do not react, as if they are used to the
procedure, as if it is something that happens often and is
not terribly interesting. On the other hand, something really
exciting happens to Lisping Man. He notices a YOUNG LONER
WOMAN hiding behind a tree. He stealthily approaches her and
the woman, realising there’s no escape, starts pleading with
him to let her go. The young woman has a lisp. Lisping man
notices it as soon as she starts speaking. His eyes sparkle.
LISPING YOUNG WOMAN
Please don’t shoot me. I’ll give
you this rabbit. It’ll make a great
supper.
Lisping Man shoots her. He smiles and leans over her
unconscious body, pushing her hair away from her face so that
he can take a better look at her.

39

INT. COACH - MIDDAY
David and Lisping Man sit together. We hear the cries of a
hotel guest injured during the hunt throughout their
conversation.
DAVID
If you two are so well suited, I’m
sure they’ll make an exception.

28.
LISPING MAN
I hope so. It’s not just that she
can’t pronounce her s’s, she’s also
blonde. Her hair is the exact same
colour as mine. We’d make a perfect
couple.
DAVID
If you’re so well suited, I’m sure
they’ll make an exception.
40

INT. INDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING
Hotel guests are shooting at targets, so the room is really
noisy. David, Limping Man and Lisping Man sit on a bench
waiting their turn to shoot at a training target with a gun.
Lisping Man looks excited. Limping Man does not look at
Lisping Man, but is listening to what he says. David seems
more involved in the conversation.
LISPING MAN
I spoke with the Hotel Manager and
she said that no one should get
involved with a loner. She said
it’s dangerous and suggested that
if I really love her that much, the
right thing to do is to keep her in
my room as a pet. She suggested I
turn her into a parrot and I
agreed. The only problem is I can’t
open the windows in my room
anymore, or when I open them I can
only open them a little. Yesterday
she flew around the room and around
the ceiling light and hit against
the walls and windows, and when I
turned the light off she kept on
flying for a little bit and then
stopped. I guess she fell asleep.
Have you thought what animal you
want to be if you don’t make it?
A lobster.

DAVID

Lisping Man takes a plastic bag out of his jacket pocket.
Inside are various coloured feathers he has plucked from the
bird. His eyes are full of joy as he opens the bag and shows
the feathers to David and Limping Man.
LISPING MAN
It’s such a beautiful parrot. It
has green, blue, yellow and red
feathers. Take a look.

29.
Limping Man stands up and doesn’t even bother to look at the
contents of the bag. He puts his hands into his trouser
pockets and his face turns very serious.
LISPING MAN (CONT'D)
If I don’t make it, I’m going to
become a parrot. We’ll live
together. That’s for sure. Why
don’t you become parrots too? Then
we’ll all be together.
LIMPING MAN
You’re a complete idiot, picking
one of the few animals that can
talk when you have a speech
impediment. You’ll lisp, even as an
animal. [To David] As for you,
they’ll catch you and throw you
into a pot of boiling water until
you die and then they’ll crack open
your claws with a tool like pliers
and they’ll suck out what little
flesh you have with their mouths.
You’re pathetic, both of you. I’m
not going to be turned into some
animal. I’ll come visit you though
with my partner when we’re walking
together in some park or when we’re
swimming in the sea or when we’re
on one of our trips.
Lisping Man punches him in the stomach. Limping Man has his
hands into his pockets, and so doesn’t have time to react.
David separates them. The waiters do not interfere, they just
watch the fight. As soon as David manages to calm them down,
it’s his turn to take a shot at the range.
TRAINER WAITER
Room 101, please.
David goes and stands beside the waiter. The waiter hands him
the gun.
TRAINER WAITER (CONT’D)
It’s no coincidence that the
targets are always shaped like a
single person and not a couple.
Kill the loner. Shoot him through
the heart.
41

INT. ROOM 101 - MORNING
There’s a knock on the door and the Maid enters. She makes
the bed. David watches her every move. He seems on edge. He
keeps out of her way while she does what she has to do.

30.
MAID
How many darts did you use
yesterday?
Twelve.

DAVID

The Maid leaves twelve tranquilliser darts on the bedside
table. She notes something down in a folder.
MAID
Please take off your trousers and
sit on the bed.
DAVID
Can we not do this today? It’s
awful.
MAID
I know. But I’m afraid we have to
do it. And you have no idea how
much it helps you psychologically
in your search for a partner.
David takes off his trousers and sits on the edge of the bed.
The Maid sits in his lap and jiggles about. She reaches down
to grab his cock every so often. David looks like he is
enjoying it against his will. He closes his eyes and lays
back. Suddenly she gets up.
MAID (CONT’D)
Today you became erect quicker than
on other days. That’s good. Have a
nice day.
DAVID
Please, just a little bit longer.
The Maid takes her trolley and leaves. David gets up and runs
after the maid. He’s pathetic and desperate.
DAVID (CONT’D)
That’s awful. Just awful.
42

INT. HOTEL POOL - MORNING
Nosebleed Woman is swimming. Limping Man limps up to the
pool’s edge and dives into the water. He swims up to her.
David lies on a lounger by the pool and watches them chat.
Hello.
Hello.

LIMPING MAN
NOSEBLEED WOMAN

31.
LIMPING MAN
Do you like to swim breast stroke,
front crawl, butterfly or back
stroke?
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
I like all the strokes equally. I
perhaps like back stroke a little
less because I can’t see where I’m
going. I’m always afraid I’m going
to hit a rock or bump into someone.
LIMPING MAN
You’re absolutely right. You know,
I love breast stroke. No, really,
my friends often tease me and say,
“Stop swimming breast stroke all
the time!” and then they laugh.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
Breast stroke is great. Excellent
exercise for the back.
Nosebleed Woman turns her head away to the left. When Limping
Man is certain she can’t see him, he purposely knocks his
head on the side of the pool and his nose starts to bleed. He
acts as if nothing has happened.
LIMPING MAN
When swimming breast stroke, men
shouldn’t wear swim shorts as it
really limits movement in the
buttocks. But you knew that, didn’t
you?
He shows her his breast stroke kick.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
I think your nose is bleeding.
LIMPING MAN
Really? Oh no, not again. This
happens to me all the time. It’s
very, very annoying.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
I know. I have a nosebleed problem
too.
43

INT. ROOM 101 - EVENING
David is sleeping. The dog is sleeping too. There’s a knock
at the door. David gets up and answers it. Limping Man stands
outside.
DAVID
What’s the matter?

32.
LIMPING MAN
I want to talk to you.
DAVID
Have a seat.
LIMPING MAN
I came to say goodbye.
DAVID
I saw what you did. It must have
hurt.
The man bangs his nose against the wall and it bleeds.
LIMPING MAN
I’m going to ask you a question and
I want you to answer me honestly.
What’s worse, to die of cold and
hunger in the woods, to become an
animal that will be killed and
eaten by some bigger animal, or to
have a nosebleed from time to time?
DAVID
To become an animal that will be
killed and eaten by some bigger
animal.
Exactly.

LIMPING MAN

DAVID
She doesn’t suspect that you’re
lying?
No.

LIMPING MAN

Limping Man hugs David. He stains his shirt with blood.
LIMPING MAN (CONT’D)
Don’t worry about your shirt. Rub
it with salt or scrub it with
ammonia and it’ll come out right
away but whatever you do, don’t use
hot water. Goodnight.
44

INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT
All the residents are dressed up - black tie and gowns. This
is obviously a special occasion. The Hotel Manager is
presenting the new couple: Limping Man and Nosebleed Woman.
They are now formally together, a confirmed couple.

33.
Their life together will begin with everyone’s blessing. It’s
like an instant wedding, a non-ritual ceremony.
HOTEL MANAGER
I’m very happy because we have a
new couple. They met just two days
ago but they are very much in love
and perfectly suited. They both
have the same problem with their
noses. They bleed quite suddenly.
The rest of the hotel guests clap. Nosebleed Woman’s Best
Friend cries. She realises she is losing her best friend
forever and feels abandoned. David hesitates at first, but
after a while he claps too. But he doesn’t smile, and seems
worried. A WAITER holds a velvet cushion with tassels, with a
room key on it. The Hotel Manager hands the couple the room
key.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D)
Tomorrow they will be transferred
to a double room with a larger
wardrobe and a larger bathroom.
They will be allowed to use the
group sports facilities and to eat
together in the restaurant. They
will stay in a double room for two
weeks and then their final test
awaits. The pier.
The rest of the guests clap once more. Limping Man takes the
microphone. He speaks loudly, with excitement and joy.
LIMPING MAN
I’m very happy.
Me too.

NOSEBLEED WOMAN

HOTEL MANAGER
What are your thoughts on
paedophilia?
LIMPING MAN
I’m against it.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
I’m against it.
HOTEL MANAGER
Good. Do either of you have a
serious illness that could prove
fatal within the next five years?
No.

LIMPING MAN

34.

No.

NOSEBLEED WOMAN

HOTEL MANAGER
Very good. The course of your
relationship will be monitored
closely by our staff and by me
personally. If we notice any
problems, any fighting or tension
between you which you cannot
resolve yourselves for whatever
reason, you will be assigned
children. That usually helps. A
lot.
The couple leaves the room, waving the audience goodbye.
45

EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON
David, Nosebleed Woman, her Best Friend and Limping Man are
looking at some children locked behind some railings in a
large enclosure. They all wear identical clothes, tracksuits.
Most of them are playing. One of the children comes up to
them.
CHILD
Hello. My parents split up two
years ago. They are both animals
now. I’m ten years old. I’m very
good at algebra and even better at
geometry. If you choose me, I’m
100% sure you won’t be
disappointed. I’m seriously
thinking of going to study at the
university. Come closer.
Limping Man goes closer. The child strokes Limping Man’s
cheek and hair.
CHILD (CONT’D)
I love you so much, daddy. Don’t be
sad, daddy, everything will be
fine, you’ll see. I love you so
much. You’re so strong, stronger
than any of my classmates’ dads.
Here you are, daddy, here’s that
cold beer you asked for.
David, Nosebleed Woman, her Best Friend and Limping Man
leave. The child can be heard from afar.
CHILD (CONT’D)
Look, daddy, I can ride my bike
with no hands. If you don’t pick me
I hope you die alone and that they
find your body days after you die.

35.
DAVID
I’m sure you won’t need a child.
You’ll get on just fine.
46

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON
Nosebleed Woman’s Best Friend and David are walking back to
their rooms, side by side. David looks at her, notices her
figure, the way she walks, her hands, her necklace, her hair.
David’s voice grows softer. His tone changes.
DAVID
You have really nice hair.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND
I know. Look.
Nosebleed Woman’s Best Friend flicks her head to show David
how smoothly her hair moves.
DAVID
How do you like mine?
NOSEBLEED WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND
Well, I think you have quite dry
hair. It’s also quite obvious
you’ll be bald in a few years.
DAVID
There are ways that you can get
your hair back. You can get hair
transplants nowadays.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND
They are rarely successful. You can
always tell when someone has had a
hair transplant. Nice hair is not
something you can get, it’s
something you’re born with. And
something that needs lifelong care.
Her strictness on the hair issue ends their conversation and
David can’t muster the courage to have another try.
Disappointed, he now walks behind her and not next to her.

47

INT. HOTEL BAR - MORNING
The Hotel Manager, Nosebleed Woman and her Best Friend sit at
a table. The Best Friend is crying. Nosebleed Woman is not.
HOTEL MANAGER
Today is your last day. As is
customary, you can choose how you
would like to spend your last
night.
(MORE)

36.
HOTEL MANAGER (CONT'D)
What I always say in these
situations is that it would be wise
to choose something you cannot do
as an animal, like read a work of
classic literature or sing a song
you really like. It would be silly
if you chose, for example, a walk
in the grounds or to have sexual
intercourse with someone because
these are things you can also do as
an animal. But first, your best
friend would like to read something
she wrote for you that is really
very touching.
Nosebleed Woman unfolds a sheet of paper.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
We always sat together at school
and whenever I had a problem I
talked to you about it because you
always gave the best advice. When
we didn’t manage to find dance
partners at the school prom, the
fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.
I’m sorry things have come to this.
I’m sure that if you had a few more
days you’d find someone, just like
I did, because you’re an admirable
person and you have very beautiful
hair and very nice breasts. I was
always jealous of your hair, you
know that. You were, are, and
always will be my best friend and
I’ll think of you often and I’ll
always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday. I’ll
miss you and however many new
girlfriends I make in a few days
when I move back into town, I don’t
think I’ll find another as true or
as beautiful as you.
Nosebleed Woman’s Best Friend gets up and slaps her. The
Hotel Manager separates them. Nosebleed Woman’s nose is
bleeding from the blows.
NOSEBLEED WOMAN’S BEST FRIEND
I’d like to watch the film “Stand
By Me” with River Phoenix, Kiefer
Sutherland and Richard Dreyfuss.
Alone.

37.
48

INT. ROOM 101 - DAY
David looks out of his room window. The Maid holds a pony by
its reins. She opens the gate to the hotel grounds and sets
the pony free. Nosebleed Woman and Limping Man hug in the
hotel entrance and wave goodbye to the pony. The pony doesn’t
run off. It just stands there, swishing its beautiful tail.
The room phone rings. The display reads 180. He doesn’t pick
up.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Room 101. Please leave a message
after the tone.

49

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
David holds a bag of golf clubs and watches a couple playing
basketball one on one in the court from behind the wire
fence. They’re having fun, they yell and kiss. David is
fixated by them.
FEMALE V.O.
When I was at the hotel, I never
much left my room. Hardly ever. I
went there around four years ago.
From the very first day I knew
there was no one there who
interested me. I used to listen to
a lot of French music back then,
and no one else listened to French
music there. I stayed for 19 days.
I let a waiter fuck me in order to
help me escape. After he’d fucked
me he said that he wouldn’t let me
go and that I’d better just go back
to my room and quick. I killed him
and left. I also killed a resident
who tried to stop me leaving
because he said he liked me.

50

EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY
David heads back towards his room carrying golf equipment. He
sees a crowd of people. Biscuit Woman lies on the ground,
covered in blood. She isn’t dead and is screaming in pain.
David runs towards the crowd. He sees the injured woman lying
on the ground and shuts his eyes. He turns away as he can’t
stand to see her suffer. He spots Heartless Woman and
instantly changes his facial expression. He tries hard to
look calm and indifferent.
DAVID
What happened?

38.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
She jumped from the balcony of Room
180.
DAVID
I hope she dies right away. On
second thought, I hope she suffers
quite a bit before she dies. I just
hope her pathetic screams can’t be
heard from my room because I’m
thinking about having a lie down
and I need peace and quiet. I was
playing golf and I’m quite tired
and the last thing I need is a
women dying slowly and loudly.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
I can’t hear you with all this
screaming. We’ll talk some other
time when it’s quieter. Bye.
Heartless Woman leaves. David turns and watches her leave.
TWO WAITERS arrive with a stretcher.
51

INT. ROOM 101 - AFTERNOON
David plays the message Biscuit Woman left on his answering
machine before she committed suicide. The incident has
obviously upset him. There’s a hint of regret in his face.
The dog stands beside him, as if listening to the message
too.
BISCUIT WOMAN (MESSAGE ON ANSWERING
MACHINE)
Hello. You’re probably in the
bathroom, that’s why you can’t
hear the phone ring. There’s
nothing better than a cold shower
in the morning.
(pause)
I’ll call again a little later when
you’ve finished your shower so we
can chat.
He pushes play to hear it again. The dog wanders off.

52

INT. BALLROOM - EVENING
Heartless Woman sits alone at a table. David goes up to her.
He now seems confident.
DAVID
May I join you?
Heartless Woman looks at him and doesn’t answer right away.

39.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
I don’t care. Sit if you like.
Heartless Woman looks at him. They don’t talk, they just
watch the other couples dancing on the dance floor. He takes
his jacket off and stirs the ice cubes in his glass with his
index finger. She takes a cherry from a bowl and pops it in
her mouth. She chokes. Her face turns red. She slumps over
the table and her body jolts about in the chair. David does
not react. After a while she stops her charade.
HEARTLESS WOMAN (CONT’D)
I think we’re a match.
DAVID
Yes, I think so too. Would you like
for us to live as a couple from now
on?
HEARTLESS WOMAN
Yes. We’ll inform the reception
desk in the morning.
Great.
53

DAVID

INT. DOUBLE ROOM 202 - EVENING
David, Heartless Woman and the dog enter the room. This room
isn’t much bigger than the old one but there is a double bed
and two bathrobes in the closet. Heartless Woman gives the
dog a plate with water. The dog laps up the water. David
looks happy. He checks the bed and the sheets, he takes his
clothes off and sits on the chair.
DAVID
Do you normally sleep on the left
or the right side of the bed?
HEARTLESS WOMAN
The left. You?
DAVID
The right. Perfect.
They sit down on their respective sides of the bed. David
takes off his trousers. Heartless Woman sits on his lap and
jiggles about, just like the Maid used to do. She reaches
down to grab his cock every so often. Eventually they fuck.
David is behind her. During intercourse he whispers “mmm” and
Heartless Woman stops and turns to look at him.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
What was that sound? Did you say
something?

40.

No.

DAVID

HEARTLESS WOMAN
Do you mind if we fuck in a
position where I can see your face?
Sure.

DAVID

HEARTLESS WOMAN
Turn the light on please, so I can
see you better.
David turns the light on and they carry on having sex, during
which he tries desperately not to grimace or show signs of
overexcitement. She looks him straight in the eye to see if
he makes any facial expressions. During his orgasm, David
tries hard to remain cold. This is the most difficult part of
the process. His face is sweaty, his eyes wide open.
Heartless Woman, on the other hand, is naturally
expressionless. As soon as they are done, they get dressed.
DAVID
Should I turn off the light or
would you like to read?
HEARTLESS WOMAN
I’d like to read. Does the light
bother you?
DAVID
No. I’m not bothered by light or
noise. I’m a deep sleeper.
Heartless Woman reads. David gets under the covers and turns
his back to her. He then turns again and he puts his arm
around her waist. He closes his eyes and sleeps. Heartless
Woman eyes him suspiciously.
54

EXT. HOTEL GARDENS - MORNING
David, Heartless Woman and the dog are out for a walk. The
couple walk hand in hand. They meet Limping Man, who is out
walking with Nosebleed Woman and a LITTLE GIRL.
LIMPING MAN
Good morning.
DAVID
Good morning.
LIMPING MAN
Congratulations.
Thank you.

DAVID

41.
LIMPING MAN
This is our daughter. Her name is
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, give the nice
man a kiss. He’s a friend of mine.
The girl goes up to David. He does not bend down to be
kissed.
DAVID
The last thing I want right now is
a kiss from a silly little girl.
They stand there a little, motionless and then David kicks
the child on her shin. She bursts into tears and Nosebleed
Woman takes her into her arms.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Don’t cry, Elizabeth. You should
thank me, now you’ll have a limp
and be more like your father.
David and Heartless Woman leave with the dog.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
You should have punched her in the
face too and bloodied her nose and
then said, “Don’t cry, Elizabeth.
You should thank me, now your nose
is bloody and you’ll be even more
like your father.”
DAVID
You’re right. Why didn’t I think of
that.
55

INT. DOUBLE ROOM 202 - DAY
David wakes up. Heartless Woman stands over him in a quite a
threatening way.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
Good morning.
DAVID
Good morning.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
I killed your brother. I left him
to die very slowly. He may not be
dead yet, even as we speak. I was
kicking him for ages.
She shows him her leg. Her shoe is covered in blood. David
tries very hard not to show his true feelings - he’s
devastated but pretends that he’s indifferent to what’s
happened.

42.
DAVID
It doesn’t matter.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
He whined a little. A strange kind
of bark. Something like this. Woof
ow-woof. It must’ve been from the
pain. You didn’t hear anything?
No.

DAVID

HEARTLESS WOMAN
You really are a deep sleeper.
Would you like some coffee?
DAVID
I’d love some.
David goes to the bathroom.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
Right. I can’t wait to hear the
story you promised to tell me last
night, about that student of yours
at the university and his awful
final project.
DAVID
It’s really a very funny story. His
name was Ryess. R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.
David splashes water on his face and then finally bursts into
tears. Heartless Woman enters the bathroom and slaps him.
DAVID (CONT’D)
These aren’t tears. It’s just
water.
HEARTLESS WOMAN
I knew you were lying. I can’t
understand why you did it when you
know as well as anyone that a
relationship cannot be built on a
lie. We’re going to the Hotel
Manager right now and you’ll get
the punishment you deserve.
DAVID
What’s the punishment for this?
HEARTLESS WOMAN
They turn you into the animal no
one wants to be. You know which
one.
DAVID
Yes. I know.

43.
56

INT. HOTEL CORRIDORS - EVENING
David and Heartless Woman are walking around to find the
Hotel Manager. She holds him by the hair. The pain is visible
on his face. David suddenly kicks her in the stomach and gets
away. He takes the lift. She runs up the stairs.

57

INT. HOTEL FIRST-FLOOR CORRIDOR - EVENING
Heartless Woman reaches the first-floor corridor and tries
each door one by one. She sees a door slightly ajar. She
pushes it open and enters. She sees a WOMAN giving a WAITER a
blow job. A second waiter, the 30-year-old waiter, is fucking
her while a third, the 50-year-old waiter, sits watching in a
chair and wanks off.

58

INT. HOTEL STAIRS - EVENING
Heartless Woman exits the room, walks down the corridor and
goes up to the second floor. She is absolutely cool, she
doesn’t look angry or nervous, just determined.

59

INT. HOTEL SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR - EVENING
Heartless Woman sees the Maid in the middle of the corridor
holding a tray with a glass of Campari and soda.
MAID
I saw a man running back that way.
He looked frantic.
As soon as Heartless Woman turns back, David emerges from one
of the rooms with a tranquilliser gun and shoots her. The
Maid leaves the glass of Campari next to Campari Man, who is
also unconscious inside the room, and then helps David lift
Heartless Woman.
FEMALE V.O.
At first he wanted to kill her in
some horrible and painful way, like
the death she had inflicted on his
brother. He thought about kicking
her in the stomach over and over
again and then stabbing her in the
same spot, in the stomach. But then
he thought that there wouldn’t be
much point because she was already
unconscious and so she wouldn’t
feel any pain from the kicks or the
knife.
David carefully carries Heartless Woman through the hotel
with the help of the Maid. They meet no one in the corridors.
He takes her to the room where they transform people into
animals. The Maid unlocks the door.

44.
60

INT. ANIMAL TRANSFORMATION ROOM - EVENING
The Maid asks David to shoot her with the tranquilliser gun
too, so that no one will suspect her of helping him. He
shoots her and she falls down unconscious. David shuts the
door behind him.
FEMALE V.O.
And so he decided to turn her into
an animal. A hotel maid helped him
and he never understood why she did
it. I asked him many times what
sort of animal he turned her into,
but he always gave the same answer.
“That’s none of your concern”. That
night he left the hotel, once and
for all.

61

INT. ROOM 101 - EVENING
The Hotel Manager runs to the couple’s room with two waiters.
She sees the dead dog. She signals to the waiters to set off
the alarm. “You Give Love A Bad Name” by Bon Jovi plays
loudly throughout the building.
FEMALE V.O.
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed but he was
headed towards us. This was the
start of his new life and back
then, he didn’t know how much it
hurts to be alone, how much it
hurts when you cannot reach to rub
tiger balm on your upper back and
you are constantly in pain.

62

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING
David cautiously disappears down the end of the corridor.
III. THE WOODS NEAR THE HOTEL

63

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David walks very quickly, almost at a jog, as if he is too
tired to run but too scared to walk. He stops beside a river.
He washes his face and drinks some water. He steams up his
glasses with his breath and rubs them clean with his t-shirt.
He continues to walk quickly. He gets tired. The woods are
quiet and the only thing you can hear is the birds and the
sound of water. Everything is still and there are no animals
around that he can actually see. He lies down on the ground
but doesn’t close his eyes.

45.
He just rests but it’s obvious that he isn’t relaxed at all.
He used to visit these woods as a hunter but now he is the
prey.
64

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David washes his hair in the river with little bottles of
shampoo he stole from the hotel. Suddenly, he hears a noise.
A LONER MAN is swimming. David goes towards him.
Hello.

DAVID

LONER SWIMMER
Don’t shoot. I can tell you where
the others are hiding. What would
you prefer, one extra day or a
whole extra week, maybe even two
weeks?
DAVID
I’m alone. I just escaped from the
hotel.
LONER SWIMMER
Did your time run out or did you
lie and get caught?
DAVID
My time ran out.
LONER SWIMMER
Okay. I got away about a year ago.
Don’t worry. There’s nothing to be
afraid of now. So long as they
don’t catch you.
65

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Loner Swimmer takes David to the LONER LEADER, a woman of
around 30. She and the rest of the LONERS wear the same
waterproof capes and carry backpacks with their personal
belongings. David seems a little bit lost as he tries to
adapt to the current situation which he wasn’t prepared for.
He looks around amazed at all these loners who form this
autonomous community in the forest.
LONER SWIMMER
I found him out in the woods. He
escaped from the hotel. He didn’t
lie, his time ran out.
LONER LEADER
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

46.

No.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
That’s a pity, we need a doctor. We
had one but they caught him a
couple of months ago.
DAVID
I’m an architect.
LONER LEADER
That’s okay. Are you on any
medication these days we should
know of?
DAVID
Well, not really. I have pain in my
upper back and I often put some
heat rub cream on it, but that’s
all. Nothing important, really.
LONER LEADER
Alright. So, welcome. You can stay
with us for as long as you like.
You can be a loner until the day
you die, there’s no time limit.
DAVID
Thank you very much.
David smiles. Loner Leader gives him an awkward hug.
LONER LEADER
By the way, any romantic or sexual
relations between loners are not
permitted and any such acts are
punished. Is that clear?
DAVID
Can I have a conversation with
someone?
LONER LEADER
Of course you can, so long as there
is no touching or flirting or
anything like that. That applies at
dance nights too. We all dance by
ourselves, that’s why we only play
electronic music. We have dance
nights every now and then.
DAVID
That’s nice.

47.
66

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
Loner Swimmer, aided by a BANDAGED LONER with bloodied
bandages over his mouth, gives David a waterproof cape, a
portable CD player, a pocket-sized game of solitaire, the
book “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck and a knife. David
realizes that he’s going to be a proper member of this group.
As these changes are taking place David acts in a mechanical
way, without really thinking where all this will lead him. He
looks at Bandaged Loner. There’s fresh blood on his bandages.
DAVID
What’s wrong with your mouth?
LONER SWIMMER
He can’t talk. He was given the Red
Kiss.
DAVID
What’s the Red Kiss?
LONER SWIMMER
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner and
we forced them to kiss each other.
That was a few days ago now but the
cuts were deep and they’re still in
pain. They were flirting, you know.
Check if the portable CD player
works properly otherwise I’ll have
to find you some new batteries.
Davis presses play on the CD player. Music plays. He pushes
the stop button.
DAVID
It works just fine.

67

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David takes off his t-shirt and rubs Tiger Balm cream onto
his upper back, as far as he can reach. He cannot reach most
of his upper back properly.

68

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
Loner Leader watches a pig eating some weeds. She creeps up
without making a sound and slips a lead around its neck. They
start walking in the woods. Wherever the animal stops, the
leader digs into the ground with her hands as if looking for
something. She then gets up, wipes the soil off her hands and
continues walking the pig.

48.
69

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
The loners stand in rows and exercise. Loner Leader checks
their technique, corrects them whenever necessary, and yells
at the lazy ones.
FEMALE V.O.
That was the first time I saw him.
He was exercising three rows behind
me but because I’m shortsighted, I
couldn’t see him clearly. In any
case, he seemed quite presentable.
We see a woman, whom we’ll soon get to know as SHORTSIGHTED
WOMAN, exercising and looking at David. David does what the
others do, a little confused but determined at the same time.
FEMALE V.O. (CONT’D)
The next day, in town, I found out
that he was shortsighted too, just
like me and I knew for sure that he
liked me. That night, in my sleep,
I dreamt that we lived in a big
house together in the town with a
large, well-lit kitchen and I was
wearing dark blue trousers and a
tight cream blouse and he took my
clothes off and fucked me up the
arse and as he was fucking me a
thug came into the kitchen and took
the steak knives from the second
drawer and attacked us, stabbing
the knives into our bellies one by
one. I woke up terrified.
The loners then form a line and start jogging through the
woods. A LONER gets caught in a foothold trap. He screams.
The others stop but don’t help him. They talk amongst
themselves and give him advice on how to free himself. David
watches. Shortsighted Woman stands behind him.
LONER LEADER
Try harder. Pull the trap open with
your hands. Positive thinking is
everything at times like this.
Don’t give up. You know, you
should’ve been more careful. Try
harder. Or they’ll find you and
you’ll be turned into an animal. A
weak one.
The other loners laugh.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
We must get a move on now. It’s
really too dangerous to stay here.
The hotel guests could be here any
minute.
(MORE)

49.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
If you manage to free yourself, run
as fast as you can and come find
us. If you manage to free yourself
but think that you’ll die from the
bleeding, go straight to your
grave. Have you dug your own grave?
Yes.

TRAPPED LONER

LONER LEADER
Very good. That’s enough for now.
Let’s split up and spread out.
We’ll rendezvous tonight at meeting
point four.
70

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David hides and hears the sound of people running and guns
firing. He tries to cover himself with leaves, moving slowly
and quietly, and smears mud on his face. Silly little things
out of inexperience and despair. Despite his efforts, he is
quickly discovered by Lisping Man, who takes aim at David
with his tranquilliser gun. David puts his hands up.
LISPING MAN
What you did to that woman was
dreadful. I can’t understand why
you would turn her into a dog and
then kick her to death.
DAVID
She killed my brother. I would have
done the same thing if she’d killed
you. You’re like a brother to me.
You’re my best friend in the whole
world.
LISPING MAN
I don’t believe I’m your best
friend in the whole world. You used
to spend a lot more time with the
man with the limp.
DAVID
That doesn’t matter. We didn’t
speak much but we both knew that in
a pinch we’d be at each other’s
side. Did the man with the limp
make it?
David is not very convincing. But Lisping Man mellows.
LISPING MAN
They’re getting ready for the pier.
It all begins next week.
(MORE)

50.
LISPING MAN (CONT'D)
Everyone says they’re going to make
it as they’re very well suited and
the child will help them get past
the fighting. What time do you get
up in the morning?
DAVID
Whenever we like. And we eat
whatever we like.
LISPING MAN
You’re not thinking of coming back?
You know, if you told the Hotel
Manager about your brother she’d
probably forgive you.
DAVID
No. It’s really nice being on your
own. There’s no one tying you down.
You listen to music whenever you
like, go for walks whenever you
like, have a chat whenever you
like. I don’t miss companionship at
all. I only miss you because you
were my one true friend. Are you
going to shoot me?
LISPING MAN
I’m afraid I have to. I only have
two days left.
David becomes aggressive all of a sudden.
DAVID
What did you say? I can’t
understand you, the way you speak.
LISPING MAN
I’m going to shoot you. I only have
two days left and I need more time.
DAVID
You really believe another day will
make a difference? Have you seen
how ugly you are? You haven’t got a
chance. If I were a woman, I’d…
Lisping Man prepares to shoot him. Shortsighted Woman jumps
out from behind a bush and stabs a knife into Lisping Man’s
leg, then David grabs Lisping Man’s tranquilliser gun and
shoots him.
Thank you.

DAVID (CONT’D)

51.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Don’t tell anyone I helped you. If
you want to repay me, there is a
way. If you kill a rabbit, bring it
to me to eat. Do you promise?
Yes.
Bye.

DAVID
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

Shortsighted Woman leaves. David stands still and watches her
walk off through the trees until she disappears. As soon as
he realizes what has just happened he searches through the
still-unconscious Lisping Man’s pockets. He finds some bird
feathers, which he throws away. He strips off Lisping Man’s
clothes and takes them with him, along with his gun and
shoes.
71

EXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - MORNING
The waiter-driver and the Maid, who joined him for the
journey, sit outside the coach. The Maid is the one who
helped David escape. She picks up a bag and slings it over
her back.
MAID
I’m going to go hunting for
truffles. They’re delicious and
quite rare. A kilo can fetch up to
2,000 pounds.
DRIVER WAITER
You’re going to need a pig. They’re
impossible to find, otherwise.
I know.

MAID

DRIVER WAITER
Don’t be long. We have to take them
back in 50 minutes.
Okay.
72

MAID

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
The Maid walks and stops under a tree. She looks left and
right, as if she’s waiting for someone. She then looks at her
watch. Loner Leader appears. She kisses the Maid’s hand.
MAID
Good morning.

52.
LONER LEADER
Morning. Did you bring the stuff I
asked for?
MAID
The gun is in the bag, as is the
key to the small door. The numbers
of the double rooms are in this
blue folder. Try not to lose the
key, I have to put it back where I
found it. I suggest Saturday
because after the dance everyone is
quite tired and many of the staff
are off work on weekends.
LONER LEADER
What about the shampoo?
MAID
I forgot it. I’ll bring you two
bottles next time.
LONER LEADER
You’re terrific, you know that?
MAID
I don’t know how much longer I can
take living in that horrible house
with that fat dentist. He’s always
asking whether I’ve flossed and
forces me to brush my teeth after
every meal, however small. The
other day he kissed me on the
cheek. When all this is over I’m
going to kill him in his dentist’s
chair. I’m going to shove the drill
into his belly.
The Maid sits on a rock and covers her face with her hands.
It looks like she’s crying, but she’s not.
LONER LEADER
It’ll all be over soon. Be patient
and don’t forget to take your birthcontrol pills. I’ll say it again,
it’s terrific what you’re doing.
Loner Leader hugs the Maid.
73

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Loners sit around the woods and rest after the hunt. Loner
Swimmer eats fruit, Shortsighted Woman listens to music on
her headphones, Bandaged Loner reads a book. Beside him sits
a female loner who also has bandages on her mouth - she’s
probably the other loner punished with the Red Kiss torture.
David sits next to Loner Leader.

53.
She rubs a hydrating cream onto her hands and face. She
offers some to David but he declines with a shake of his
head.
LONER LEADER
Tomorrow we’re going into town.
We’re going to buy some new books
as some people have been
complaining that they’ve read the
same book two or three times over.
Also, someone lost the second
volume of “Crime and Punishment”
during a chase and lots of people
have read the first part and are
waiting to see what happened next.
You can come, if you like.
I’ll come.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
Excellent. Then you should clean
up. We must look like very decent,
presentable couples tomorrow. Make
sure you cut your nails and comb
your hair.
DAVID
Should I put some aftershave on?
LONER LEADER
No, that won’t be necessary.
74

EXT. THE WOODS, TREE HOLLOW - EVENING
Loner Leader pulls a plastic bag out of a tree hollow and
takes some “civilian” clothes from inside. She hands David a
suit.
LONER LEADER
Hope it fits.
Thank you.

DAVID

The suit actually fits.
75

EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING
A typical urban environment. Couples, cars, buses, kids,
shops. David has his arm around Shortsighted Woman and Loner
Leader has her arm around Loner Swimmer. They’re dressed like
office workers. They walk through the town and enter a
shopping centre. They seem happy. They stare at the shop
windows, then browse random things like nail polish, paint
brushes, cotton sheets and wooden frames.

54.
76

INT. SHOP - MORNING
They buy knives, a pair of trainers, bandages, a wrist watch
and small individual cartons of orange juice.

77

EXT. SHOP - MORNING
David waits for the others. Next to him are three police
officers and a woman on her knees. The head officer talks
into a mobile CB Radio. The other is checking the woman’s
nails and asks her to show him the soles of her shoes.
POLICE OFFICER
Woman. Blonde. Approximately 30-35
years old. Certificate expired two
months ago.
WOMAN ARRESTED
My husband is a lawyer. You’re all
going to be sued.
The police officer with the CB looks to the officer who was
been checking the woman and gives him a nod.
POLICE OFFICER
No dirt under her nails or mud on
her shoes. 9 Belsize Road.
One of the police officers approaches David.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Good morning, sir.
DAVID
Good morning, officer.
David tries to remain calm. Shortsighted Woman comes out of
the store and hugs David.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I’m sorry, darling. They had such a
huge variety of knives. I bought
this one, it’s ideal for meat.
DAVID
That’s wonderful, dear. Excuse me a
moment. How can I help you,
officer?
Shortsighted Woman kisses him on the cheek.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Do you know this woman, by any
chance?

55.
DAVID
Actually I’ve never seen her
before.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Thank you, sir. You have a nice
day.
DAVID
You’re welcome, officer.
The officer leaves. Shortsighted Woman hugs David again with
the knife in her hands.
78

EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING
Out on the street again. David holds Shortsighted Woman’s
hand. They don’t look at each other, but if anyone took a
look at them they’d swear they were a real couple.
DAVID
If I’m walking too slowly just say
and I’ll up my pace.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
This pace is fine. Maybe don’t
squeeze my hand so tight, my palm’s
getting a little sweaty.
Better?

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Yes, much better.
DAVID
Are you planning on buying anything
for yourself in town?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Yes, contact lens solution and a
Parker Rollerball.
DAVID
I didn’t know you were
shortsighted. I’m shortsighted too.
They stop talking knowingly, as if there’s nothing more to be
said.
79

EXT. HOUSE - DAY
The four loners stand outside the front door of a house.
Loner Leader rings the doorbell. An elderly gentleman opens
the door.

56.

Dad?

LONER LEADER

The gentleman hugs her.
80

EXT. HOUSE GARDEN - DAY
Loner Leader talks to a dog near a kennel, but we can’t hear
what’s being said. The rest sit around a large table and
drink orange squash. The couples are very tender with each
other. David checks on Loner Leader from time to time. We
don’t know what connects her to the animal; if it was her
brother, sister, uncle or just some normal dog. She comes
back to the table and sits down.
LONER LEADER’S FATHER
Will you stay a few days?
LONER LEADER
I’m afraid not, Dad. We’re heading
back again today. Tomorrow I’m
going away on a business trip. You
know how demanding my job is, don’t
ask if I can stay a few days every
time I come.
LONER LEADER’S FATHER
Do you all work for the same
company?
Yes.

DAVID

LONER LEADER’S FATHER
My daughter tells me it’s a very
fine company. Do you agree?
David struggles to keep things vague but consistent.
DAVID
It’s a rather good company, yes.
One of the best, I’d say. The only
problem with the job is that I
don’t have enough time for my wife
and kids. We have four beautiful,
healthy children.
LONER LEADER’S FATHER
Congratulations.
DAVID
But even if we’d never had
children, I’d never dream of
leaving my wife.
(MORE)

57.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own, we’d go on trips, we’d
go to Portofino in Italy or to a
Greek island for the summer and so
our relationship would be as
intense as it was at the start. I
love her so much I could die for
her. That’s how much I love her.
He takes Shortsighted Woman’s hand and kisses her on the lips
in front of everyone for quite some time.
81

EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY
The two supposed couples walk down the street. David and
Shortsighted Woman walk in perfect sync.
LONER LEADER
Well done. For your first day in
town, you did great. That bit about
holiday destinations in the
Mediterranean was brilliant.
DAVID
Thank you very much.
They feel proud. Shortsighted Woman tightens her grip on
David’s hand.

82

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David prepares to hunt rabbits. He sets up rabbit traps using
three wooden sticks and a big stone. He joins the sticks
together to form the shape of a 4 and then places the stone
on the biggest stick. When the rabbit tries to take the bait
under the rock, the trigger stick moves and the stone falls
on the animal.
FEMALE V.O.
You carefully flay the rabbit with
a sharp knife and cut off its head.
You then slice open its belly and
stuff it with well-washed red and
green peppers, not too spicy, and a
little garlic and mint.
We see that David has caught three rabbits. His hands are
covered in blood from the slaughtered animals. He puts the
dead rabbits in a large sack, dripping with blood.

58.
FEMALE V.O. (CONT’D)
You then soak it in lemon juice and
leave it a while to marinate the
flesh, skewer it on a stick and
roast it over the fire for about an
hour. That’s my favourite food,
rabbit.
He leaves two of the rabbits beside the sleeping Shortsighted
Woman.
83

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David sleeps. His digital wristwatch alarm beeps and wakes
him up. He turns off the alarm, gets up and goes to the
river’s edge to wash his face. As he pulls up his shirt
sleeves, he sees a phrase written on his hand in biro: “River
bank, beside the tree, 11 a.m.” He rubs the note off with
water, looking round to see if anyone is watching.

84

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David and Shortsighted Woman sit side by side. In front of
them sprawls a seal. It’s the first time they are alone
together, so they are both a bit tense. At first they avoid
making eye contact and talk with long pauses. He is more shy
than she is.
DAVID
When did you become shortsighted?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
When I was 16. You?
DAVID
When I was 12.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
What make were your first pair of
glasses?
DAVID
I don’t remember.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Do you have astigmatism too?
Yes.

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back, on the bits you can’t
reach on your own?

59.
DAVID
I’d like that.
Shortsighted Woman takes the jar of Tiger Balm from his bag
and rubs it onto his back.
85

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Loner Leader gives the other loners clothes like the ones
worn by the hotel guests and a few pistols. She opens the
blue folder the Maid gave her. The loners pay close
attention. They are silent and highly disciplined.
LONER LEADER
Good evening everyone and good
luck. I hope you can read my
handwriting without any trouble.
The room numbers are as follows.
Room 206, couple with nice voices.
Room 240, couple who both love to
ski. Room 282, couple who both
studied, I’m sorry, I can’t quite
make it out, couple who both
studied… I think it’s social
sciences. Pier, couple prone to
nosebleeds.
David waits in line. He also takes a set of clothes.

86

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
The loners walk through the woods with flashlights. They
don’t talk, or if they do they whisper. First in line is
Loner Leader. Shortsighted Woman follows. David is last in
line. He looks slightly worried.

87

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING
The loners open a small gate using the key the maid gave them
and enter the hotel gardens. They check to see if there are
any waiter guards around and hide behind some bushes. David
goes up to Loner Leader.
LONER LEADER
You and you take 206, you and you
take 240, you, you and you take
282, you take the pier.
David jumps in.
DAVID
Can I go to the pier?

60.
LONER LEADER
Okay then, you go to the pier and
you go to 282. We have half an
hour.
The loners split up and head off in different directions.
88

INT. ROOM 206 - EVENING
Loner Leader, Loner Swimmer and Shortsighted Woman stand over
a couple naked in bed. Loner Leader speaks to the couple,
aiming her gun at them. She takes a look at the note the Maid
gave her.
LONER LEADER
So, you both have nice voices, is
that right?
Yes.

MAN WITH A NICE VOICE

LONER LEADER
Do you prefer singing duets or when
one of you sings the lead and the
other does backing vocals?
MAN WITH A NICE VOICE
Duets, mostly.
As the dialogue plays out, Shortsighted Woman picks up a pen,
a notebook and two CDs marked BEST LOVE SONGS EVER: VOL. III
and slips them into her bag without anyone noticing. Loner
Leader addresses the Man With a Nice Voice.
LONER LEADER
You, if we kill this woman, do you
think you’ll manage on your own or
will you get involved with someone
else?
MAN WITH A NICE VOICE
I don’t know.
LONER LEADER
Do you think this woman can survive
on her own, or not? What’s your
opinion?
MAN WITH A NICE VOICE
If you’re going to kill someone,
kill me. I love her more than
anything in the world. If you’re
going to kill someone, kill me. I
love her more than anything.
Loner Leader now aims her gun at the Woman With a Nice Voice.

61.
LONER LEADER
If we kill this man, do you think
you’ll manage on your own or will
you get involved with someone else?
WOMAN WITH A NICE VOICE
No, I wouldn’t get involved with
anyone else, I’d live alone.
Without a shadow of a doubt.
LONER LEADER
Do you believe this man can make it
on his own?
WOMAN WITH A NICE VOICE
No. I can live alone, but he can’t.
I’m on my own for hours while he’s
at the pool or at the bar. I like
sitting in the room, it relaxes me,
calms me, I like it a lot. I think
you should kill him. I won’t
disappoint you.
Loner Leader hands the Woman With a Nice Voice the pistol.
She’s startled at first. Then she looks at the Man With a
Nice Voice in the eyes and mercilessly pulls the trigger.
The gun doesn’t fire. It isn’t loaded. The three loners
leave them alone together.
89

EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - EVENING
David walks quickly. He holds a tranquilliser gun. He spots
hotel signage pointing towards various locations. He stops in
front of a sign. It reads “BEACH/PIER/MINI GOLF”.

90

EXT. PIER - EVENING
Two waiters guard the yachts moored at the pier. Automatic
rifles are slung across their backs. But they seem relaxed
and not very alert. The light is on in one of the three
yachts.
30-YEAR-OLD WAITER
The only thing that troubles me is
when someone orders something and
then they insist they ordered
something else. For example,
someone says they want an espresso
and then say they didn’t order an
espresso but a cappuccino and get
all rude about it and annoyed. I
find that quite troubling.

62.
50-YEAR-OLD WAITER
In situations like that you need to
be polite and make them realise
their mistake. If this gets you
nowhere then take back their
espresso and bring them a
cappuccino, that way you avoid any
hassle. If the problem doesn’t go
away, if they use physical violence
or if they continue to change what
they asked you for, you just have
to speak with the manager.
Understood?
Yes.

30-YEAR-OLD WAITER

David walks towards them. He hides the tranquilliser gun
behind his back.
50-YEAR-OLD WAITER
Room number and reason for being
out, please.
David swiftly shoots them both with the tranquilliser gun.
They fall down unconscious.
91

INT. YACHT - EVENING
David climbs aboard the yacht. He carefully looks through the
cabin window. Limping Man and Nosebleed Woman wear identical
nautical striped outfits. His is stained with blood. Their
child, Elizabeth, also sits with them.
LIMPING MAN
A basketball weighs between 550 and
650 grams. Did you know that?
NOSEBLEED WOMAN
No, I didn’t know that.
LIMPING MAN
Yes. It’s weight is different for
men’s and women’s games, but that’s
roughly how much they weigh. Do you
know how much a volleyball weighs?
ELIZABETH
No, but I’d love to find out.
David startles them, appearing behind the little girl. He
sits down beside them at the table and places the gun next to
him.
DAVID
Good evening.

63.
He takes a glass from in front of Limping Man and the knife
from next to the little girl’s plate and taps the glass with
the knife.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I have an announcement to make. His
nose doesn’t really bleed on its
own. He bangs it against a wall or
a piece of wood or some other hard
surface, or else he cuts it with a
pen knife while you aren’t looking.
So the answer to the question “Are
you suited?” is 100% “No, you’re
not”.
ELIZABETH
Shut up. Dad, tell him to leave.
I’m sleepy.
DAVID
I’m sure that the stain on his tshirt is not blood but cherry juice
or tomato ketchup or red
watercolour paint or something like
that.
Limping Man and Nosebleed Woman get up and start to hit him.
One holds him down while the other kicks him. David drops the
knife.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Or beetroot juice.
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the floor.
ELIZABETH
Kill him. Mum, here’s the knife.
Kill him.
Limping man pushes David out of the cabin.
LIMPING MAN
Get out of here while you still
can.
David looks at them with a weird mix of shame and contempt
and then leaves. The hotel alarm sounds from the yacht’s
speakers. He jumps to the pier and starts to run towards the
fence where the others are waiting for him. Shortsighted
Woman smiles slightly the moment she sees him returning safe.
92

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
The loners dance, everyone on their own. Electronic music
plays. David does not dance. He tries to find Shortsighted
Woman amongst the others. He sees her but before he has time
to approach her, Loner Leader goes up to David.

64.
LONER LEADER
Why aren’t you dancing?
DAVID
My leg hurts a little.
LONER LEADER
Did you dig your own grave?
Not yet.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
I don’t mean to pressure you, or to
ruin the mood now that we’re
celebrating, but at some point
you’ll have to do it. Don’t expect
anyone else to dig your grave for
you, or to carry your corpse. We’ll
throw some dirt over you but that’s
about it. Tomorrow find a spot you
like where the ground isn’t too
rocky and make a start. Enjoy the
rest of your evening.
93

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David spies another loner taking rabbits to Shortsighted
Woman. She smiles and says something to RABBIT LONER, who
then says something back. It must have been something very
funny because he laughs loudly then waves her goodbye and
leaves. As soon as Rabbit Loner is gone, David goes up to
her. He’s obviously upset but tries to hide it.
DAVID
Did you catch rabbits?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
No, someone brought me them.
Who?

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
A friend of mine. You want one?
No.

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
You’re jealous?
DAVID
No, I’m not jealous. It’s just you
don’t need to accept rabbits from
other people.
(MORE)

65.
DAVID (CONT'D)
If you need more rabbits, just tell
me and I’ll bring you more.
Catching a rabbit is difficult, but
I’ll try harder. There’s no need
for you to be indebted to the
others.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Thank you very much.
DAVID
That man who brought you the
rabbits, is he shortsighted?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I don’t know. I don’t think so.
94

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David goes up to Rabbit Loner who’s shaving his face in the
river. He stares at him for a while then speaks loudly.
DAVID
Afternoon. Is that a sparrow up in
that tree?
RABBIT LONER
I can’t really see that far, but I
don’t think so.
DAVID
Are you shortsighted?
No.

RABBIT LONER

DAVID
You’re lying.
RABBIT LONER
It’s the truth.
DAVID
What does it say here?
David shows him the zip on his jacket.
YKK.

RABBIT LONER

DAVID
You knew that already. All zips say
the same thing.

66.
RABBIT LONER
I’m not shortsighted. I don’t
understand why you won’t believe
me. I can see very clearly. I used
to be a pilot.
DAVID
You’re wearing contact lenses.
RABBIT LONER
I’m not wearing contact lenses. I’m
not shortsighted, I swear.
DAVID
You are. You think I’m an idiot and
can’t tell.
David hits him, kicks him and pins him down. He pulls open
his eyelids.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Look up. I said, look up.
Rabbit Loner obeys. David fingers his eyeballs to check
whether he’s wearing contact lenses or not.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Now down. Left and right.
David gets up. Rabbit Loner stays down on the ground.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. I thought you were
trying to fool me. I’m sorry.
95

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David and Shortsighted Woman put CDs into their portable
players. Beside them stands a pony, it might be that girl
from the hotel.
DAVID
We need to concentrate, we both
have to press play at the same
time. I’ll count down from five and
we’ll push the button on zero.
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
The both push their buttons and dance in each other’s arms.
We hear the same song playing twice, overlaid, the two
streams a little out of sync.

96

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
During the voice over, we see various scenes from the lives
of the loners.

67.
Loners watching a dog attacking a seal in the middle of the
woods, a loner fighting with another loner, a loner lying
dead, loners washing themselves in the river, Loner Leader
feeding the pig.
FEMALE V.O.
We’ve developed a code so that we
can communicate with each other,
even in front of the others,
without them knowing what we are
saying. A handstand means “I miss
you so much”. When we turn our
heads to the left it means “I love
you more than anything in the
world” and when we turn our heads
to the right it means “Watch out,
we’re in danger.” We had to be very
careful in the beginning not to mix
up “I love you more than anything
in the world” with “Watch out,
we’re in danger.” When we raise our
left arm it means “I want to dance
in your arms”. When we make a fist
and put it behind our backs it
means “Let’s fuck, I’m horny”. The
code grew more and more as time
went by and within a few weeks we
could talk about almost anything
without even opening our mouths.
About history, music, our
childhood, everything.
97

INT. LONER LEADER’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - MORNING
Loner Leader, Loner Swimmer (her supposed husband), her
father and her mother, sit on the sofa. They all seem
relaxed, they’ve been drinking and they’re enjoying the
stories told by the elderly couple. David and Shortsighted
Woman sit in a corner.
LONER LEADER’S FATHER
I met your mother when we were at
school. We were both top of the
class in music. I was a little
better than her on the guitar
because my fingers are longer and
stronger, which is very important
when playing chords. She was better
at singing. We began meeting to
study together. We became a couple
just a month before leaving school.
If we’d waited one more month, we’d
have been sent to the hotel. Can
you imagine?

68.
LONER SWIMMER
Let’s not talk about unpleasant
things. I can’t wait for you both
to play us some music.
Loner Leader’s father begins to play the guitar. Her mother,
sitting beside him, begins to sing. David kisses Shortsighted
Woman on the hand. She begins to stroke his hair and then
french kisses him for a long time. Loner Leader, annoyed,
slaps them.
LONER LEADER
That’s enough. Show my parents some
respect, they’re playing you music.
LONER LEADER’S MOTHER
That’s okay.
LONER LEADER
No mother, it is not okay. Please,
continue.
LONER LEADER’S MOTHER
Do you want us to perform the same
song, or something else?
LONER LEADER
Something else.
98

EXT. TOWN STREET - MORNING
Loner Leader and Loner Swimmer go on ahead. David and
Shortsighted Woman follow behind. They regret being so
intimate at the gathering. David tries to read Loner Leader,
to figure out if she suspects them or not.
DAVID
We were great today, weren’t we?
Maybe even better than last time.
Loner Leader says nothing. They walk quickly.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Didn’t her parents sing and play
beautifully?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
It was wonderful.
David and Shortsighted Woman smile but seem worried.

99

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
The loners eat fruit together. Loner Leader hands out
bananas. They sit around a tree trunk. David covers his left
eye with his hand. Shortsighted Woman does a handstand.

69.
All part of their secret code that nobody else understands. A
pink flamingo stands in the distance.
100

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
A LONER WOMAN reads from a notebook. Her voice is that of the
female V.O. we’ve heard throughout the story. Loner Leader
listens beside her.
LONER NARRATOR
“We love each other and we suit
each other. That’s the reason why
we’ve decided to leave and stay
together forever in the town.
Tomorrow, during the hunt, we’re
going to disappear and everyone
will think we’ve been captured and
that we’re going to be turned into
dogs or canaries or something. I
think the first thing I’m going to
do when I get into town is buy a
bathrobe and then we’ll go to a
pool with a high diving board
perfect for diving. And we’ll do
lots of different things together,
serious things not silly ones, like
go for walks in the park or play
the guitar together”. That’s where
it ends. There are some notes at
the back but I don’t think they’re
important.
Loner Leader stands perfectly still. She seems shocked and
enraged even though she kind of suspected it.
LONER LEADER
Read me the notes.
LONER NARRATOR
“Portofino: Italian fishing village
and upmarket resort famous for its
picturesque harbour. Population:
439. Beaches nearby: Paraggi Beach,
Camogli, Chiavari and Lavagna.
Serifos: Greek island located in
the western Cyclades. Population:
1,414. The Miners’ Strike of 1916.
In the 20th century, the mines of
Serifos were exploited by the
mining company “Société minière
Sérifos-Spiliazeza” under the
direction of the German
mineralogist A. Grohmann, who died
in 1905”.

70.
LONER LEADER
That’s enough. Where did you find
it?
LONER NARRATOR
In the woods. Someone probably
dropped it during the hunt. Do you
think it belongs to one of us?
LONER LEADER
No. One of the hotel guests must
have dropped it. None of us would
have written such drivel.
She takes the notebook and leaves.
101

EXT. THE WOODS - EVENING
Loner Leader goes up to Shortsighted Woman. She’s reading a
book by torchlight. Loner Leader sits next to her and talks
to her in a really friendly tone of voice.
LONER LEADER
You’re reading?
Yes.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

LONER LEADER
Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could
read without the help of glasses or
contacts?
Yes.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

LONER LEADER
I’d like to ask you a favour.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
What sort of favour?
LONER LEADER
Do you have a sheet of white paper,
by any chance? I want to make a
list of the stuff we need from town
and there’s no paper left in my
notebook.
Shortsighted Woman looks in her backpack for her notebook.
She starts rummaging, distressed.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
It’s fine if you don’t have any.
I’ll ask someone else.

71.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
But I do. I’m sure I have a
notebook with white pages, it’s in
here somewhere, I’m sure of it.
LONER LEADER
Don’t worry. It doesn’t matter.
Tomorrow when we go into town I’ll
make a note to buy you a new one.
Loner Leader tenderly touches Shortsighted Woman on her
shoulder and leaves.
102

INT. DOCTOR’S SURGERY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Loner Leader, Loner Narrator and Shortsighted Woman are in a
waiting room. The three women are seated on a sofa. There is
a coffee table with past issues of various magazines in front
of them. Loner Narrator reads one of these magazines.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
It’s very dangerous for three women
to be alone in town together. It’s
highly likely the doctor will
suspect us. I suggest we leave the
first chance we get. Right now, in
fact.
LONER LEADER
Don’t be afraid. No-one will
suspect a thing. I bet you weren’t
expecting this surprise. Isn’t it
wonderful?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Yes, it is. Still, I’d like to
think it over for a few days, and
maybe I’ll have the surgery done
when we’re next in town.
LONER LEADER
What’s there to think about? If
it’s better to see clearly or to be
shortsighted, is that it? That’s
absurd, you know that. Anyway, this
doctor is the best there is, it’s
really very difficult to get an
appointment. I called him months
ago to get him to see you today.
A SECRETARY goes up to them and shows them the door to the
doctor’s office.

72.
103

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MORNING
The DOCTOR sits behind his desk. Loner Leader and
Shortsighted Woman sit in two chairs opposite him. This is a
typical doctor’s office: big wooden bookcase, a mix of oldfashioned and modern furniture, some framed prints of famous
paintings. The doctor’s hands are shiny and clean, like the
hands of most doctors.
DOCTOR
This operation is what we call
“routine surgery”. It has a 90%
success rate, so there’s no need to
worry. There are no scalpels
involved, the entire procedure is
done by laser. There’s no reason
why you shouldn’t see clearly when
you’re swimming in the sea or when
you first wake up in the morning.
Contact lens solution, contact lens
cases, eyeglasses, all that will be
a thing of the past.
LONER LEADER
Thank you very much, doctor.
Shortsighted woman doesn’t speak. She makes quite an effort
to appear happy but doesn’t make a very good job of it.

104

INT. OPERATING THEATRE - MORNING
Shortsighted Woman lies frightened on an operating table. She
looks around, sweating. The Doctor anaesthetises her by
intravenous injection. He then lays out various scalpels on a
metal tray.

105

INT. DOCTOR’S SURGERY WAITING ROOM - DAY
Loner Leader sits and waits. The Doctor brings out
Shortsighted Woman, whose eyes are bandaged up. Loner
Narrator approaches Shortsighted Woman and gives her a hug.
She then puts her jacket over Shortsighted Woman’s shoulders
and fixes her hair with her hands. Loner Leader pays the
Doctor. He has a quiet word with Loner Leader but we cannot
hear what he says very clearly.
DOCTOR
(whispers)
She is blind, as you wished.

106

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
Shortsighted Woman, kneeling on the ground, holds a knife. It
looks like there’s just been a fight. She’s flushed red.

73.
Unable to see, her eyes still bandaged up, Shortsighted Woman
threatens anyone who might be close to her with her knife.
Loner Leader and Loner Narrator keep their distance.
LONER LEADER
Throw down your knife and stand up.
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

LONER LEADER
You’re being completely irrational.
I understand you’re upset by the
unexpected results but to accuse me
is very insulting to say the least.
The doctor said there were some
unforeseen complications after your
surgery. That is all. Who would
have guessed such a simple
procedure could have such
catastrophic results? No one.
Anyway, what reason could I
possibly have had to do such a
hideous thing on purpose?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Why did you have to blind me? You
could have blinded him.
LONER LEADER
I have no idea what you’re talking
about. The drugs are messing with
your head. If I were you, I’d try
and be a little braver about the
whole thing. Now get up and give me
the knife, or I’ll hit you and take
it by force.
Shortsighted Woman says nothing. She’s still holding the
knife in a threatening manner.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Here I come.
Loner Leader signals to Loner Narrator, who goes over to
Shortsighted Woman. She grabs the hand holding the knife and
they begin to fight. Loner Leader speaks close to Loner
Narrator’s head, so that the Shortsighted Woman, who is now
blind, thinks she’s wrestling with Loner Leader.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I swear I’m going to kill you.
LONER LEADER
No, don’t, please. Let go of my
hair, you’re hurting me.

74.
Shortsighted Woman has grabbed Loner Narrator by the hair and
now stabs her in the stomach. Loner Leader stays close so
that it seems it’s really her fighting Shortsighted Woman and
groans in pain with each stab.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Have mercy, please, [groans] don’t
kill me. Just think [groans] that
when someone [groans] goes blind,
one of their other senses [groans]
is heightened. Touch, hearing,
smell [groans]. You’ll smell
better, hear better. You’ll feel
things with your fingers and know
what it is you’re touching
[groans].
Silence. Loner Narrator has been dead some time now.
Shortsighted Woman raises herself up a little. She feels out
the dead woman’s body with her hands and takes her pulse. She
puts down the bloody knife, wipes her hands and gets up. That
is when Loner Leader begins her monologue again. Shortsighted
Woman jumps in fear.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
You could also catch a dog in the
woods and train it to guide you.
Dogs can do that, you know. I’ll
help you catch a dog myself. Now
that I think of it, your sense of
touch may already be heightened.
Let’s find out right now. I’ll put
something in your hand and you tell
me what it is. Okay?
Loner Leader gives her something and closes her hand around
it tight.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Make a fist. Feel what it is, feel
its shape. It’s not difficult.
Shortsighted Woman falls down and screams. Loner Leader
continues to squeeze her fist.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
What is it? What is it? I’ll give
you a little more time to guess but
I can’t wait much longer. What is
it?
Shortsighted Woman screams. Loner Leader lets go of her hand.
She opens her fist and her palm is covered blood.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Time’s up. It’s a small razor
blade.
(MORE)

75.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
It seems your sense of touch hasn’t
improved yet but it’ll happen,
you’ll see. Now get up. If you
carry on acting like this I’m going
to leave you here and I don’t think
you’ll manage to find meeting point
two on your own.
107

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David meets with Shortsighted Woman. She sits on a rock. She
has taken the bandages off and wears sunglasses. She tries to
act calm.
DAVID
Did you have a nice time in town?
Sure.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
What happened to your hand?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I was cutting a tree branch with a
knife, and cut myself by accident.
You look handsome today. Did you
get your hair cut?
DAVID
Thank you. No, I didn’t get a
haircut, I’m going to have my hair
cut today. Look what I brought you.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Thank you very much. I’m so hungry,
I’ll eat it right away.
David is momentarily puzzled.
DAVID
It’s a bigger flashlight.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I’m sorry, it’s so big I thought it
was a rabbit. It’s the biggest
flashlight I’ve ever seen.
DAVID
Are you ready for tonight?
Shortsighted Woman decides to drop her act.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Of course I am. I want to tell you
something but please don’t get
angry.

76.
DAVID
What happened?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I can’t see a thing. I’m blind.
DAVID
What do you mean?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
There’s no point lying to you,
you’ll find out sooner or later.
I’ve lost my sight. Loner Leader
blinded me this morning, in town.
She must have realised that I love
you and you love me and that we
were going to leave for the town.
DAVID
How did she find out?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I don’t know. I think she found my
notebook.
DAVID
What notebook?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
My notebook. I had a notebook,
where I’d write my thoughts about
us, about how suited we are. I’m
sorry.
DAVID
You can’t see at all?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
No, not at all.
DAVID
And when you asked if I’d had a
haircut?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I said it so you wouldn’t realise I
can’t see. I’m sorry.
David kicks some dirt. He seems frustrated and disappointed.
He turns towards Shortsighted Woman.
DAVID
Don’t cry. Crying will make your
eyes hurt even more. We’ll find a
way.

77.
108

EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT
Some loners sleep, others listen to music around a batteryoperated lantern. David lies on the ground and seems very
sad. Loner Leader goes up to David, holding a pig on a leash.
LONER LEADER
I’m going to hunt for truffles. Do
you want to come and keep me
company?
DAVID
I’m a little sleepy.
LONER LEADER
We won’t be long. I’ve found a spot
where there are lots of them. We
won’t be long, I promise. Come on.
David gets up.

109

EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT
David and Loner Leader walk through the woods holding
flashlights. David looks scared. He doesn’t know if he‘s
about to be punished as well.
LONER LEADER
Thanks for coming with me.
Something terrible happened today
and I needed some company.
DAVID
What happened?
LONER LEADER
Didn’t you hear what happened in
town?
No.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
Shortsighted Woman had an operation
and went blind. It’s so very sad.
And then my deputy leader was
killed on our way back. She was
attacked by a jaguar. I’m really
very upset because I was thinking
of making Shortsighted Woman deputy
leader as she’s very capable and
loyal. But then I gave it some
thought and realised that now it
will be difficult for her to
command so many people. The next
person I thought could take on such
a responsibility is you.

78.
DAVID
Thank you very much.
LONER LEADER
Don’t thank me. I trust you
completely and I consider you one
of the best loners I’ve seen in
years. I know you won’t disappoint
me in any way. If something happens
to me, you will take over. Take a
few days to think about it and let
me know when you’re ready. Here’s
the place with the truffles. You
can’t imagine how many there are. I
wanted you to come with me and see
it for yourself. If you become
deputy leader, you’ll need to know
where in the woods you can find
lots of truffles.
110

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
Shortsighted Woman lies under a tree. David stands beside her
holding four carrots and a fish. Apparently he’s decided not
to give up yet.
DAVID
What blood type are you?
B.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

David thinks some more.
DAVID
Do you like berries? Blueberries?
Blackberries?
No, no.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
Can you play the piano?
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
Do you speak German?
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

79.
DAVID
I could teach you German but it
would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics, not
fluently. So there’s no point. You
know, German is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to
learn because its grammar is very
complicated.
David wakes up, terrified.
111

EXT. THE WOODS, MIDDAY
Shortsighted Woman lies under a tree. David goes up to her
holding four carrots and a fish. He looks at her, a little
lost in thought.
DAVID
What blood type are you?
B.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

David thinks some more.
DAVID
Do you like berries? Blueberries?
Blackberries?
No, no.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
Can you play the piano?
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
Do you speak German?
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
I could teach you German but it
would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics, not
fluently. So there’s no point. You
know, German is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to
learn because its grammar is very
complicated.

80.
112

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David hands Shortsighted Woman a plastic cup. She feels it
with her fingers.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
A plastic cup.
DAVID
That’s right. Very good.
He then hands her a tennis ball.
A kiwi.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
That’s right. Ten out of ten,
again.
She smiles.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m making a fist behind my back.
Shortsighted Woman now becomes serious.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
That can’t happen. I can’t thank
you enough for keeping me company,
for the games and activities but
you know we can’t do that any more.
Do you want to play another round
of “touch-think-guess-win”?
DAVID
No, that’s enough for today. In any
case, I’ve run out of things to
test you with. Maybe tomorrow, or
one of these days.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Tomorrow morning?
We’ll see.
113

DAVID

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David sings a duet written for a man and a woman all on his
own. He only sings the male part and leaves out the female
part. A rabbit comes up close to him. David looks at it but
does not kill it. He has no reason to hunt rabbits anymore.
The rabbit hops off.

81.
114

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David walks through the woods with Loner Leader. He stops at
some point and looks around.
LONER LEADER
How do you like this place here?
It’s nice.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
It is nice, and more importantly
very quiet because of the rocks you
have to climb to get here. Can you
imagine why I brought you to such a
quiet place today?
No.

DAVID

LONER LEADER
Because I think it’s the perfect
spot for your grave. It was my
second choice for my own grave, but
in the end I decided on a place a
little to the north of here because
there are fewer dogs around there,
digging all the time for bones.
She takes a small pickaxe from her pocket and gives it to
him. David starts to dig. After a while he gets tired and
stops. He’s only managed to dig a small hole. He climbs into
it but his whole body won’t fit. He tries to fit as best he
can.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
You have to make it bigger so
you’ll fit better. As I said, there
are a lot of dogs around here. Now
cover yourself with soil. Use your
hands.
He scoops some soil onto his body and sits there a little,
motionless.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Over your face too. You wouldn’t
want your face to get eaten, would
you?
David puts more soil over his face and body. He seems
terrified.
LONER LEADER (CONT’D)
Can you see how great this spot is?

82.
DAVID
Yes. Thank you very much.
Loner leader cuts a flower and puts it on David’s grave.
LONER LEADER
If you die before me, I’ll visit
you as often I can. I promise.
David stays motionless.
115

EXT. WOODS - MORNING
David walks in the forest and comes across a pony. The animal
is probably the woman with the nice hair at the hotel,
Nosebleed Woman’s Best Friend. David stares at the pony with
a mixture of confusion and anger. His face is still full of
dirt.
DAVID
Hi, how are you? It’s very nice
meeting you again.
He cuts the pony’s mane with a pair of scissors. The animal
stands still. He then looks the pony in the eye and hits it
across the face.
DAVID (CONT’D)
How do you like my hair now?

116

EXT. THE WOODS, MORNING
Shortsighted Woman and two other loners are down on their
knees trying to set a rabbit trap. David approaches them.
DAVID
Good afternoon.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
How are you?
Fine.

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I’m hungry. You haven’t brought me
a rabbit in days. Or things for me
to touch and guess.
DAVID
I’ve got good news. I’ve had a
great idea. Have you got a minute?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
What sort of idea?

83.
David takes Shortsighted Woman aside and describes his idea
to her using the physical code they’ve developed between
them, but now describing the movements to her orally.
DAVID
I raise my left foot. I bring my
elbow to my knee and tap it twice.
I bring my foot to my knee and tap
it three times. I lie face down.
I kneel down. I touch my left cheek
and then lie face up.
Shortsighted Woman thinks for a minute.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Are you sure you are prepared to do
that?
DAVID
It’s the only way.
She doesn’t speak.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Yes, of course I am. I wouldn’t
propose it if I wasn’t.
When?

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
Tomorrow morning?
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Tomorrow morning.
David leaves. Shortsighted woman smiles but seems unsure at
the same time.
117

EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT
David attacks a woman in the dark. He hits her. She falls
unconscious and we see the face of Loner Leader. He takes a
roll of gaffer tape from his pocket, ties her up and gags her
mouth. He then drags her away.

118

EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT
Loner Leader, tied up, lies in David’s freshly dug grave.
Dogs circle the shallow pit. Loner Leader tries in vain to
cut herself loose.

84.
119

EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
David and Shortsighted Woman walk quickly, as if running with
very small steps. David walks a little ahead, and
Shortsighted Woman holds his hand and follows behind. They
are wearing their civilian clothes but David’s suit doesn’t
fit him very well. It’s a little tight. They talk as they
walk.
DAVID
Are you thirsty?
No.

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN

DAVID
It’s not much farther. I can
already see the buildings.
There are no buildings in sight yet.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
That’s perfect.
Shortsighted Woman continues to walk, a little faster now.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN (CONT’D)
We should speed up a little bit.
DAVID
These trousers are too tight. I’m
sorry. It was dark and I couldn’t
see clearly and I didn’t have the
time to try them on. I’m sorry.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Never mind.

120

EXT. MAIN ROAD - MIDDAY
David and Shortsighted Woman come out of the woods and onto
the road. They walk more slowly now. David hears a noise. He
turns and sees a vehicle coming in the distance. He pulls
Shortsighted Woman off the road and they hide in some bushes.
The vehicle passes them. It is the hotel coach heading into
town.
DAVID
It’s gone. They didn’t see us.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
I’m a little hungry. If you see a
rabbit, kill it and we’ll eat.

85.
DAVID
We don’t have time to hunt. We’ll
eat when we get into town.
Everything has to happen as we
said, without delay, without
wasting time for no reason. We have
to reach the restaurant before rush
hour. It’ll be much easier if there
aren’t lots of people coming and
going in the toilets.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Have you decided how you’re going
to do it?
No.

DAVID

SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Alright. Let’s not waste any more
time talking. Let’s go.
They get up and head off again down the road.
121

IV. THE TOWN

122

INT. TOWN RESTAURANT - DAY
David and Shortsighted Woman sit at a table. There aren’t
many people in the restaurant, just another couple sitting a
few tables further back. In front of them are two glasses of
water. They are silent.
Profile.

DAVID

Shortsighted Woman turns her head to the left, holds it
there, then turns it to the right and holds it there.
Fingers.

DAVID (CONT’D)

Shortsighted Woman shows him her fingers. David looks at them
carefully.
Elbows.

DAVID (CONT’D)

Shortsighted Woman pulls up her sleeves and shows him her
elbows.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Would you like me to show you my
belly?

86.
DAVID
No, I remember your belly very
well. Smile.
Shortsighted Woman smiles. She holds the smile for a long
time. David signals to a RESTAURANT WAITER. The waiter comes
to their table.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Can I have a knife and fork,
please? Not a butter knife. A steak
knife.
Certainly.

RESTAURANT WAITER

The waiter brings him a knife and fork wrapped in a napkin.
David examines both pieces of cutlery. He takes the knife and
wraps the fork back up in the napkin.
DAVID
I’m going to do it with a knife.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Do you want me to come with you?
DAVID
I’d rather you didn’t.
SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN
Don’t worry. It’s strange at first
but you get used to it. And your
other senses are heightened. Touch,
for example. Your hearing.
I know.

DAVID

David gets up from his chair. He heads towards the toilets.
123

INT. TOWN RESTAURANT TOILETS - DAY
David pulls lots of paper towels out of the dispenser. He
tucks them into his shirt collar and lays them over his
shoulders to keep the blood off. He looks at himself in the
mirror, checks to see if his hands are trembling and then
raises the knife, bringing it close to his eye. Closer and
closer. He can’t do it, and lowers the knife again. He then
takes a few deep breaths and tries again.

124

INT. TOWN RESTAURANT - DAY
Shortsighted Woman sits on her own at the table and waits.
The waiter fills her glass with water and leaves. We hear
many different voices and a door opening and closing. A
couple sits down at the table next to her.

87.
Shortsighted Woman takes a small sip of water and puts her
glass back down on the table. Beside her is the restaurant
front window, which looks onto a main road. Cars go by.
Various couples walk past, some of them have kids, others a
dog. The scene lasts some time.

THE END.
