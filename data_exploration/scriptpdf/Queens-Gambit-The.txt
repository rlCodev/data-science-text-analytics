INT. PARIS HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

1

A KNOCK ON A DOOR. Then-VOICE
Mademoiselle?
A SPLASH. Someone stirs in a bathtub. MORE KNOCKING.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Mademoiselle Harmon? Etes-vous La?
We can just make out a A FACE in the dark. Breathing.
Watching. FRANTIC POUNDING ON THE DOOR. Followed by-VOICE (CONT’D)
Mademoiselle! Ils vous attendant!
Finally, from the darkness-BETH
I’m coming...
MORE SPLASHES and SPILLING WATER as she hoists herself out of
the tub. A BOTTLE GETS KICKED OVER-Shit-2

BETH (CONT’D)

INT. PARIS HOTEL ROOM - DOOR/HALLWAY - NEXT

She stumbles through the dark room. THE DOOR IS CRACKED OPEN
and over her shoulder is the face of a MAN in a suit, out in
the hallway, clearly mortified at the sight of her.
BETH
Je descend tout-de-suite.
She shuts the door, taking us to black again. More stumbling.

INT. PARIS HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NEXT

THE BATHROOM LIGHT IS TURNED ON and there she is, staring at
herself in the mirror-- BETH HARMON. All of 20. In the same
dress she wore the night before, but now soaking wet.
Fuck.

BETH

Yeah, fuck. She looks awful. Well, she looks like what she
is: still drunk, high, whatever. Her hair, stringy and wet.
She starts to pull the soggy dress over her head--

INT/EXT. PARIS HOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER

4

She comes back into the room and opens the curtains to reveal
a grey PARIS morning outside. Having changed into a different
dress, she steps into one shoe, hunts for the other...
She shakes A GREEN PILL from a vial, spots a mini bar-sized
bottle of Vodka on the dresser with a bit still left inside,
puts the little bottle to her lips when-SOMEONE STIRS ON THE BED.
She turns, sees a shape under the covers. She stares, clearly
trying to do the math as to just who the fuck is in her bed.
She pops the pill. Drains the bottle. Grabs her shoes...

INT. PARIS HOTEL - HALLWAY - SAME

FOLLOW HER DOWN THE HALL to a grand staircase. She holds her
shoes in one hand, runs the other over her dress, smoothing
the wrinkles the best she can.
Beth hurries down the stairs, passing a MAN holding the hand
of a LITTLE GIRL on the way up. The little girl stares up at
Beth as they pass...
Beth crosses the ornate lobby, heads for another hallway-6

INT. PARIS HOTEL - ANOTHER HALLWAY - SAME

6

As Beth hurries along the quiet hallway, pauses in front of
large pair of doors and pulls on her shoes. She then pushes
through the doors into-7

A GIANT BALLROOM

7

As a hundred heads turn towards her. While the room is packed
with people, it’s dead silent. They’ve been waiting. For her.
And now we hear one sound: THE WHIR OF CAMERAS. A DOZEN
PHOTOGRAPHERS gathered at the entrance snap her picture.
The crowd parts to reveal A TABLE at the very center of the
room. A CHESSBOARD sits on top. TV CAMERAS have been set up.
The size/look hinting that it’s sometime in the mid sixties.
Seated at the table waiting for her is VASILY BORGOV, forty.
A frightening figure in a dark suit, Borgov is all eyebrows
and frown. Beth approaches, quickly shakes his hand and sits
down across from him.
I’m sorry.

BETH

He nods, says nothing. A few more photos and then SILENCE.
Beth watches Borgov make his first move. PUSH IN ON HER--

EXT. KENTUCKY HIGHWAY - DAY

VOICE
What are we supposed to do with
her?
AND NOW BETH AT 20 BECOMES BETH AT 9
The little girl staring at Camera.
ANOTHER VOICE
They’re sending someone.
BEGIN PANNING AWAY FROM BETH...
TO LOOK DOWN a ribbon of empty Kentucky Highway, hung with
low fog, as the PAN CONTINUES ACROSS THE HIGHWAY-VOICE
Not a scratch on her.
--to A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT. Car versus Truck. Head on. The car
flattened, is wedged deep under the front end of the bigger
vehicle. The TRUCK DRIVER stands away from it smoking, eyes
on A BODY that lies on the asphalt covered in a sheet. Now-CONTINUE PANNING TO LOOK UP THE HIGHWAY...
TO FIND A COUPLE OF COPS standing there holding a LONG LINE
OF TRAFFIC, the makes of the cars put us in the late fifties.
SIRENS and FLASHING LIGHTS of rescue vehicles in the distance
driving up the shoulder...
COP #1
It’s a miracle.
The other cop looks back down as CAMERA COMPLETES ITS CIRCLE
and once again FINDS BETH, in a cotton dress, staring at the
body on the ground.
COP #2
I doubt she’ll see it that way.
AS THE SIRENS GET LOUDER-9

INT. CAR - DAY

Beth stares at the mole on the face of the chatty MATRON from
Social Services behind the wheel.
MATRON
You understand, dear, your mother’s
passed on? You know what that
means, do you, passed on?
(Beth nods)
(MORE)

CONTINUED:

MATRON (CONT'D)
Well, I’m sure she’s gone on to a
better place and, someday, you’ll
get to see her again.
When?

BETH

The woman looks at Beth, smiles, then looks ahead as they
pull up to a trailer in the woods-MATRON
I imagine it must be very quiet
living way out here.
(more to herself)
Very quiet...

INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

10

The door opens and Beth follows the woman into the ragged and
tired space. Dirty dishes are piled up around a small sink.
Oh, my...

MATRON

The woman stays soft in the doorway as Beth enters, stares at
a nearly empty glass of milk on the table sitting across from
a coffee cup, LIPSTICK visible on the rim. From the b.g...
MATRON (CONT’D)
The funeral will be in a few
days...
Beth puts the cup to her lips as...
MATRON (CONT’D)
Of course, given the... scope of
her injuries, the casket will be
closed.
The woman steps forward, puts a meaty hand on her shoulder.
MATRON (CONT’D)
Have you got a suitcase?
11

EXT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

11

Beth exits with a paper grocery sack full of her belongings.
The Woman droning on as they walk to a dusty sedan, “KNOX
COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES” stenciled on the door-Elizabeth?

MAN’S VOICE

She looks to where A MAN gets out of a car, a CAMERA around
his neck. A REPORTER-- He snaps her picture...

MRS. DEARDORFF -- a tall statue of a woman in horn rims -reads the paper at her desk. A FILE open in front of her.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Elizabeth, nine, was left without
family by the crash...

EXT. KENTUCKY COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

As the sedan moves through the Kentucky countryside, Beth
rests her head on the door, letting the wind hit her face.
MRS. DEARDORFF (V.O.)
Her mother, Alice Harmon, was
pronounced dead at the scene.

INT. MRS. DEARDORFF’S OFFICE - DAY

Mrs. Deardorff looks through a file... Not much in it outside
of the paper. A photo of ALICE, a school photo of Beth.

FERGUSSEN, a young black orderly (24) stands in front of the
desk as Mrs. Deardorff peers at the file...
MRS. DEARDORFF
Doesn’t say. I would guess, though,
that, like most men who live around
there, he was yet another victim of
a carefree life.
A HORN HONKS OS and Mrs. Deardorff looks up.

EXT. METHUEN HOME FOR CHILDREN - DAY

17

Mrs. Deardorff exits the building, smiles as the sedan pulls
up alongside her. She opens the passenger door and smiles-MRS. DEARDORFF
You must be Beth.
Beth gets out, clutching a brown grocery bag, takes in Mrs.
Deardorff, the woman all put together in a woolen skirt and
matching silk blouse ringed with big pearls.
18

INT. METHUEN HOME - DAY

As Mrs. Deardorff carries Beth’s bag inside, the Social
Worker in the sedan already peeling rubber out of there
behind them. Beth watches her go.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Mr. Fergussen, this is Elizabeth
Harmon.
Fergussen nods to Beth as he quickly passes by, goes through
a door, opening it long enough for us to hear the following
goodie from inside-GIRL’S VOICE
You’re all fucking cocksuckers!
She looks at Fergussen, who gives her an I’m on it look.
FERGUSSEN
(calling off)
Jolene! That mouth is gonna be the
death of you!
MRS. DEARDORFF
(smiles at Beth)
This way, dear-Other girls nod stiffly to Mrs. Deardorff as they pass.
GIRLS
Good-morning, Mrs. Deardorff.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Good-morning, girls.
19

INT. GIRLS' WARD - DAY

19

Mrs. Deardorff shows Beth to a metal bed by the door to the
bathroom. Clearly the worst spot in the room. Made even more
apparent as we hear the TOILET FLUSH and a GIRL exits, looks
surprised to see the head of the orphanage right there.
Shoo.

MRS. DEARDORFF

The girl hurries off as Mrs. Deardorff opens the drawers
under the bed...
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
You can put your clothes down here.
And there’s a shelf for your tooth
brush and any other personal items
there.
She watches as Beth unpacks her few things from the bag.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
I know that, at this moment, all
you’re feeling is loss. But after
grief brings you low, prayer and
faith will lift you high... high
enough for you to see a new path
for yourself.
Beth just keep unpacking, doesn’t look at her.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
I think, Elizabeth, you’re going to
find a much different life here, a
better one than you might have had.
Mrs. Deardorff puts a hand on Beth’s shoulder.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
And I’m certain that you and I are
going to be good friends.
Now Beth turns around and looks up at her.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Now about that hair...
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Mrs. Deardorff watches MRS. LONSDALE cut Beth’s hair.

20

INT. LINEN SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

20

Shelves full of clothing arranged by color. Mrs. Deardorff
turns to the newly shorn Beth and holds up a plain shift to
the girl’s body.
MRS. DEARDORFF
That should do nicely.
She nods to Beth’s dress.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Off with that rag.

CONTINUED:
Beth pulls her old dress over her head, looks at her name
hand embroidered in the shape of a heart. Mrs. Deardorff
takes it from her, holds it out away from herself.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
I think we’ll burn this one.

Beth looks at her, is about to react when she hears LAUGHTER,
turns to see a couple of girls watching her from the doorway-A few GIRLS peek in as Beth hugs her skinny self.
Shoo.

MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)

A BELL SOUNDS and Mrs. Deardorff smiles at Beth.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
One more stop.
21

CUT TO A LARGE JAR OF GREEN PILLS

21

BOOM UP to reveal CHILDREN LINED UP beyond a window where now
Fergussen passes out pills and cups of water. NOW TRACK DOWN
TO THE END OF THE LINE TO BETH as Mrs. Deardorff rests a hand
on her shoulder-MRS. DEARDORFF
Mr. Fergussen will take good care
of you. I’ll see you at Dinner.
She moves off and Beth watches as each kid is given one green
pill and another brown pill. Mr. Fergussen watching, making
sure they swallow both..
VOICE
The green ones are the best.
Beth sees a girl, black, taller than the others, 14, looking
back at her. JOLENE. Another girl stands beside her.
BETH
What are they?
JOLENE
(winks at the other girl)
Vitamins.
OTHER GIRL
Magic vitamins.
For some reason that cracks up the two of them.
JOLENE
What’s your name, girl?

CONTINUED:
Beth.

BETH

JOLENE
Jolene.
(lowers her voice)
I were you, Beth, I’d save the
green ones up for the nighttime.
Otherwise they turn off just when
you need ‘em to turn on. If you
know what I mean.
Jolene watches as Beth looks around THE MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM
where the pharmacy is located. At the books, the religious
magazines and posters.
JOLENE (CONT’D)
Your mother and daddy dead?
(as Beth nods)
What’s the last thing they ever
said to you?
(leans close)
I ask everybody that one. You get
some really fun answers.
BETH
I don’t remember.
JOLENE
Well, someday you might. You let me
know if you do.
She then turns away, leaving Beth to stare at the back of her
hair.
ON THE WINDOW
As Beth gets to the front of the line and Fergussen hands her
the two pills and a cup of water. Beth looks at them...
FERGUSSEN
Green is to even your disposition.
Orange and brown’s for building a
strong body.
(holds them out)
Take them both.
(as she hesitates)
Go on.
Beth does as she’s told.
22

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Beth walks back to the Girls’ Ward. She’s unsteady, reaches
out for the wall. She’s never had “vitamins” quite like
these...

CONTINUED:
BETH’S POV AS SHE WALKS
The world seems more vibrant, the colors, the sounds. The
other kids. All of them looking at her.
Beth moves on, a dreamy expression on her face.

Up ahead a JANITOR, heavyset, his back to us, mops the floor.
He turns to watch her a moment. He’s BLURRY. No face. KEYS at
his waist JINGLE.
She stares at him, fascinated by the action of the mop in the
bucket, the sound of the keys. The Janitor turns and looks at
her and she moves on.
23

INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

23

As Beth stares as her tray is filled, mesmerized by the food.
She turns to face the room. Doesn’t know where to sit. After
a moment, she realizes Jolene is waving her over...
AS BETH SITS DOWN
Jolene takes one look at Beth’s dreamy face and laughs.
BETH
I feel funny...
JOLENE
You look funny. Thought I told you
to wait, and take them vitamins at
bedtime?
Beth stares at her plate. Pokes at it with her fork...
BETH
What is this?
Fish.

ANOTHER GIRL

JOLENE
Far as we know.
ANOTHER GIRL
We eat it every Friday.
The “fish” comes in squares and is covered in a thick orange
sauce, like French Dressing. Beth gags on her first bite.
ANOTHER GIRL (CONT’D)
You gotta eat every bite or they’ll
tell Mrs. Deardorff about you, and
you won’t get adopted.
Beth looks at her. Sees Mrs. Deardorff eating with other
teachers, staff at another table. She looks at Beth.

11.
24

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

24

Everyone in bed. Beth is the only one awake. She lies there
listening to the girls in the other beds, coughing, turning
and muttering. A SHADOW crosses her bed as the NIGHT ORDERLY
walks past. A DISTANT PHONE RINGS, A TOILET FLUSHES. VOICES
DOWN THE HALL.
She looks up at the ceiling. BRANCHES from the trees outside
the window form eerie, CRISSCROSSING SHADOWS on the ceiling.
She sees Jolene, a few beds over, taking her pill NOW. Jolene
looks back at Beth, shakes her head and lays down.
Beth rolls over on her side and curls up tight.
25

INT. GIRLS' WARD - MORNING

25

As Beth wakes up, doesn’t feel so good. Mrs. Deardorff walks
into the ward and everybody straightens up. Good Morning Mrs.
Deardorff.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Good morning, Girls. This is Mr.
and Mrs. Spellman.
A YOUNG COUPLE shyly enters behind her, apparently “shopping”
for a kid. Beth watches as the girls all quickly put delicate
HEADBANDS in their hair. Beth doesn’t have one.
She turns as the couple comes her way. But Beth looks awful.
They take one look at her and turn away.
26

EXT. EXERCISE YARD - DAY

26

The girls are all doing various forms of exercise. Beth
watches Jolene and some other girls on a jump rope. She
invites Beth over.
BETH
I’ve never done it.
Never?
No.
Try it.

JOLENE
BETH
JOLENE

Beth tries to jump in with Jolene, but catches the rope with
her foot. Beth feels like an idiot. Jolene smiles and takes
her hand--

CONTINUED:
JOLENE (CONT’D)
Hang onto me and jump when I
jump...
Beth does and misses.
Try again.

JOLENE (CONT’D)

Beth does and soon she’s doing it in rhythm with the older
girl.
JOLENE (CONT’D)
Now you’re getting it.
27

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - “VITAMIN LINE” - DAY

27

As Beth receives her pills, turns to go without taking them-FERGUSSEN
Hey-- Harmon!
She turns back. He points to the cup.
FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
Take your pill.
She has no choice. Takes the pills.
28

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

28

Another night of no sleep. Movement and voices down the hall.
The shadows from the trees on the ceiling more menacing than
ever. Beth curls up, knows it’s going to be a long night.
KNOCKING ON A DOOR OVER...
29

INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
A younger Beth lying on the couch, awake, listening to the
hushed conversation.
MAN’S VOICE
Alice, come on. Open the door. It’s
taken me a whole month to find you.
ALICE/BETH’S MOTHER
For good reason.
Beth slips out off the couch...
ALICE
You shouldn’t be here.
MAN’S VOICE
I could say the same to you.

CONTINUED:

Beth looks to the doorway of the mobile home, it’s ajar, her
mother ALICE stands there calmly talking through the crack to
a MAN we can’t quite see.
ALICE
I’m living my truth.
MAN
Your truth? You went to Cornell.
ALICE
That was a mistake. One of many.
Beth creeps closer, tries to see who’s out there.
MAN
Alice. Sweetheart. Whatever you’re
doing, whatever this is, it’s nuts,
even for you.
ALICE
I don’t expect you to understand. I
don’t expect anyone to understand.
MAN
What I understand is that you’re
not taking care of yourself.
And with that, Beth watches as he drops a VIAL OF PILLS
THROUGH THE CRACK. Alice ignores them.
MAN (CONT’D)
Just let me come in and talk to
Lizzy. Make sure she’s okay.
ALICE
You think I’d hurt her? She’s happy
here. She’s where she belongs.
MAN
Do you honestly think our daughter
belongs in a trailer, the middle of
nowhere.
ALICE
Who says she’s “our” daughter?
MAN
Alice, don’t do that--

ALICE
And she doesn’t like being called
Lizzy.

29

CONTINUED: (2)
And she closes the door. Listens. Then-ALICE (CONT’D)
Are you still there?
Then from outside-MAN’S VOICE
Alright, Alice, you win. I can’t
fight you anymore. And I can’t keep
chasing after you just to have you
run away again. But I also can’t
keep on lying awake every night
worrying about the two of you.
ALICE
You don’t have to. We’re fine.
MAN’S VOICE
Once I drive away, I’m not coming
back. So... I’m just gonna ask one
last time, is that what you really
want? For me to disappear?

Alice closes her eyes, leans against the door, presses one
hand against it. Finally-ALICE
You need to go live your life.
MAN’S VOICE
What does that mean?
ALICE
I’m sorry, Paul.
She turns, sees Beth looking at her. Then moves away into the
dark. Beth bends down PICKS UP THE VIAL OF PILLS. FOOTSTEPS.
She moves to a window, sees a FIGURE get into a car. The dome
light enough to glimpse her Beth’s Father’s face. He looks at
the trailer a moment. Then starts the car...

Jolene gets her cup of pills. And pops them in her mouth for
Fergussen to see. Then she turns around, faces---Beth waiting behind her and opens/closes her mouth, giving
Beth a flash of the GREEN PILL still on her tongue. Beth
turns, watches as Jolene casually spits the pill into her
palm on her way out the door.

The kids take a test. MISS GRAHAM patrols the rows of desks,
stopping when she finds Beth staring out the window.
MISS GRAHAM
Miss Harmon?
(Beth turns to her)
Finished already?
Beth nods, hands her the paper. Miss Graham looks at it.
Hmm.

MISS GRAHAM (CONT’D)

She looks at Beth, seems to see her differently now. She
glances at the clock, then-MISS GRAHAM (CONT’D)
Why don’t you take the erasers down
to the basement and clean them...
34

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

34

As Beth moves down a quiet corridor, tosses one of the dusty
blackboard erasers in the air. She looks off as she hears-JOLENE
...they’re all fucking cocksuckers.
And you’re the biggest fucking
cocksucker of them all...
She pauses as Fergussen passes in the other direction,
dragging Jolene down the hall by the ear...
FERGUSSEN
I never met someone, liked the
taste of soap much as you do...
Mr. Fergussen gives Beth a look-FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
Where you going, Harmon?
She holds up the erasers, keeps her eyes on Jolene who winks
at her as Fergussen drags her to a door marked SUPPLIES.
Beth carries on down the hall, gets to a staircase in the
back, goes through a door marked BASEMENT.

16.
35

INT. BASEMENT - SAME

35

Beth comes down the stairs, comes around the corner, and THE
BACK OF THE JANITOR comes into view. He sits on a metal stool
near the furnace, a single bare bulb overhead, scowling at
the green and white board in front of him.
Beth looks at the board. The funny-shaped pieces on the green
and white squares. He glances at her, then back to the board.
Beth moves to the far side of the basement and clops the
erasers together, watching the janitor the entire time.
She stares at the man through the billowing cloud of chalk
dust growing all around her-The janitor is in his fifties, heavyset, nothing particularly
friendly about him. MR. SHAIBEL.
She finishes the job and starts to leave, this time crossing
closer to the game, getting a good look at THE BOARD as she
passes. Fascinated by it. It almost seems to move.
He looks up at her and she bolts up the stairs...

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

Beth lies awake, listening to the noises of the night, but
this time, instead of gutting it out, she reaches down and
dumps the PILL from her toothbrush holder into her palm and
swallows it. She lies back and stares up at the CEILING...
...The CRISSCROSSED SHADOWS FROM THE TREES OUTSIDE begin to
SLOWLY STRAIGHTEN OUT AND FORM SQUARES. Beth stares at them,
watches as the ceiling becomes a GIANT CHESSBOARD.
The door opens, the shaft of light from the hall ruining the
chessboard on the ceiling as Mr. Fergussen checks in on the
girls, then backs out again.
Beth looks up at the ceiling as the board reappears...
38

INT. GIRLS' WARD - MORNING
Beth wakes up, refreshed, feeling better than she has.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Good morning, girls.

MRS. DEARDORFF

She walks over to A LITTLE BLOND GIRL who listens to the head
mistress. Mrs. Deardorff turns to go, but turns back with one
more thought-- she snaps her fingers and points to the little
girl’s head. Clears her throat.
The little girl quickly puts on her little headband.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Don’t dawdle.
And she walks out. Beth watches as the little girl starts
quickly collecting her things.
Not fair.

JOLENE

Beth turns to see Jolene now standing beside her.
JOLENE (CONT’D)
She came here after you.
(turns to Beth)
Most of us are lifers. Been here a
long time. Nobody’s gonna come for
us now. We’re too old.
(then)
Or too black.
Beth takes that in, watches as Mrs. Deardorff helps her pack
up her things.

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - “VITAMIN LINE” - MORNING

corner and then pockets the green one. She looks up and sees
Mr. Shaibel far down the corridor go into the basement. HEAR
THE GIRLS SINGING OVER...
40

INT. CHAPEL - MORNING

40

Miss. Lonsdale leads the girls in singing Bringing in the
Sheaves. Beth, bored out of her skull, slips out of her seat,
motions to MISS. LONSDALE that she “has to go.”
Miss Lonsdale frowns. Beth indicates “really bad.”

Beth slowly comes up behind Mr. Shaibel. He reaches out and
touches one of the knights... thinking... She comes closer,
the shadow of her head falling on the board-MR. SHAIBEL
What do you want, child?
She stands still. He turns to her.
MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)
You should be in chapel.
Saying the word like he bit into something rotten.
BETH
What’s that game called?
MR. SHAIBEL
You should be upstairs with the
others.
BETH
I don’t want to be with the others.
I want to know what game you’re
playing.
He looks up at her a moment, then shrugs.
MR. SHAIBEL
It’s called chess.
She takes a step back and he resumes his game. Beth watches
as he stares at the pieces. Motionless. As if he hates them.
She watches him reach out and pick a piece up by its top with
his fingertips, hold it for a moment as though holding a dead
mouse by the tail and then set it on another square.
BETH
Will you teach me?
Mr. Shaibel says nothing, doesn’t even register the question.
All we get are the DISTANT SINGING VOICES. She tries again...
BETH (CONT’D)
I want to learn to play chess.
Mr. Shaibel reaches out a fat hand to one of the larger black
pieces, picks it up deftly by its head and sets it down on a
square on the other side of the board. Not looking at her-MR. SHAIBEL
I don’t play strangers.

A43

As the girls all jump into their beds. Beth sneaks a pill and
lies back just as Fergussen turns off the lights.
FERGUSSEN
Sweet dreams, ladies.
And shuts the door. Beth concentrates on the ceiling, watches
as it once more forms squares...
43

EXT. EXERCISE YARD - DAY

43

Jolene plays dodge ball. Beth steps up beside her, watches as
the older girl catches the ball one handed, and sends it back
like a bullet, knocking over the girl who threw it.
BETH
You were right, the vitamins work
better at night.
JOLENE
How many you take?
BETH
I don’t know-- Sometimes I skip a
day, or a bunch of days, then take
two or three. I like the way it
feels.
JOLENE
I bet you do.
And now Jolene lifts a cigarette she’d been keeping at her
side to her lips, takes a quick hit. Jolene sees Fergussen
looking her way, smiles, shows him some leg as she says to
Beth-JOLENE (CONT’D)
You just be careful you don’t get
too used to that feeling.
44

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

44

As Beth runs up the corridor with the erasers...
45

INT. BASEMENT - DAY
Beth cleans the erasers, watching Mr. Shaibel at the chess
board. He doesn’t look up. Finally she walks over. Takes a
breath. Then--

CONTINUED:
BETH
I’m not a stranger.
(then)
I live here.
(no answer)
I already know some of it, from
watching.
MR. SHAIBEL
(finally)
Girls don’t play chess.

Beth takes a step closer, points at, but doesn’t touch, one
of the rooks-BETH
That one moves up and down or back
and forth. All the way, if there’s
space to move in. But that one can
only go up. That tall one can go
any way it wants.
Mr. Shaibel remains quiet. She’s turning to go when-MR. SHAIBEL
And this one?
And her heart leaps as he points to a bishop.
BETH
On the diagonals.
He points to a knight.
BETH (CONT’D)
One square diagonal plus one square
straight.
He looks up at her. Considers. Then-MR. SHAIBEL
Let’s play a game...
(turns to the board)
I play white.
BETH
I don’t have much time.
MR. SHAIBEL
Now or never.
BETH
I have Geography in ten minutes.
MR. SHAIBEL
Now or never.

45

21.
45

CONTINUED: (2)

She drops the erasers, drags an old milk crate from behind
the furnace to the other side of the board-Okay.

BETH

And they begin to play. He beats her in four moves. She
stares at the board.
MR. SHAIBEL
That’s called Scholar’s Mate.
BETH
How do you do it?
Not today.
Show me.
Not today.

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

46

Beth bursts out of the basement and runs for class. STAY WITH
HER as she rounds a corner, runs smack into MRS. DEARDORFF.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Elizabeth-The Head Mistress brushes stray chalk off herself as if she’s
just bumped into a drooling, shedding dog.
BETH
I’m sorry, Mrs. Deardorff-MRS. DEARDORFF
Why are we in such a hurry?
BETH
I’m late for class.
MRS. DEARDORFF
And why is that?
Beth holds up the erasers.
BETH
I clean them for Mrs. Graham.
MRS. DEARDORFF
(brushing at herself)
Apparently not enough.
(then)
(MORE)

46

CONTINUED:

MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT'D)
Here, at Methuen, we don’t run in
the halls. It’s unseemly.

22.
46

BETH
Yes, Mrs. Deardorff.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Exercise is for the outdoors.
BETH
Yes, Mrs. Deardorff.
Go on.

MRS. DEARDORFF

She watches as Beth walks off. Briskly.
47

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

47

Beth takes ONE PILL and lies back in bed. Stares up at the
ceiling. The usual noises down the hall. Tonight, however,
she hears none of them, watches the board appear above her.
REVERSE - FROM THE CEILING DOWN TO BETH
Beth concentrating. Now A DARK SHAPE MOVES ALONG THE CEILING
ABOVE BETH. And then ANOTHER, LIGHTER SHAPE MOVES INTO FRAME.
REVERSE - FROM BETH UP TO THE CEILING
CHESS PIECES HANG UPSIDE DOWN FROM SQUARES FORMED BY THE
CRISSCROSSED CEILING. The pieces are shadowy, like LARGE
BATS.
Beth looks at an eerie-looking BISHOP. It starts to slide
along the diagonal...
MOVING BISHOP POV - FROM THE CEILING DOWN TO BETH
CAMERA TRACKS at the same angle as the bishop moves over the
beds towards Beth. VOICES SINGING A HYMN OVER...
48

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

48

As Beth sneaks out of the back...
49

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

49

Beth and Mr. Shaibel move their pieces in silence until he
corners and then takes her queen. She’s clearly angry.
BOOM DOWN TO HER LEGS UNDER THE TABLE as they tightly cross
over twice.

49

23.
49

CONTINUED:
Beth stares at the board, is about to play on despite the
mortal loss when he reaches out and stops her hand-MR. SHAIBEL
You resign now.
Resign?

BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
That’s right, child. When you lose
the queen that way, you resign.
She stares at him. Not comprehending. He lets go of her hand,
picks up her black king and sets it on its side on the board.
It rolls back and forth a moment, finally lays still.
No.

BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
Yes. You have resigned the game.
BETH
You didn’t tell me that in the
rules.
MR. SHAIBEL
It’s not a rule. It’s
sportsmanship.
BETH
I want to finish.
She picks up the king and sets it back on its square.
No.

MR. SHAIBEL

BETH
You’ve got to finish.
No.

MR. SHAIBEL

He stands up, has to stoop to keep his head from hitting the
rafters.
You lost.
Please.

MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)
BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
The game is over.

49

24.
49

CONTINUED: (2)
BETH
You greedy cocksucker!
He looks at her, then-Get out.

MR. SHAIBEL

She gets up from the board and walks out. He watches her in
silence, then turns back to the board and says quietly...
MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)
The game’s over.

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - DAY

50

Beth moves away from the pharmacy window. Pockets her pill.
Sees Jolene on one of the couches wink at her.
MISS LONSDALE (V.O.)
Dancing looks like fun...
51

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

51

MISS LONSDALE, the chapel teacher, intones breathlessly-MISS LONSDALE
The music is loud and has a pumping
rhythm which makes one want to move
one’s young body right along with
it. But we all know, don’t we, that
dancing isn’t safe. It isn’t an
evil thing in itself, but we know
it can lead to evil things, don’t
we?
Jolene watches as Beth slips out the back.
52

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

52

Beth walks to the basement door, finds it LOCKED. She’s
devastated. Sits down on the floor right there. Lost.
53

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - “VITAMIN LINE” - DAY

53

As Beth receives her “vitamins.”
54

INT. GIRLS' WARD - FROM THE CEILING - NIGHT

54

As Beth takes a pill, lies back-- waits for the pieces to
appear. THEY DO... and she begins to play...
55

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
As Beth again tries the door. And again finds it LOCKED.

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

Beth lies in bed. MOVING CHESS PIECES ABOUT THE CEILING...
BETH
(quietly)
Check.
57

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

57

Beth once more walks to the basement door, tries it. LOCKED.
She smacks it with one of the erasers, then walks away.
58

EXT. METHUEN HOME - DAY

58

Beth walks out into a grey day and begins clopping the
erasers together. LAUGHTER OS. Beth looks off and sees
several LOCAL KIDS standing just outside the grounds.
One of the BOYS lights a cigarette, waves-A BIT OF THUNDER and Beth hurries back inside.
59

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

59

LIGHTNING AND RAIN out the windows. WHISPERED VOICES and Beth
turns to see SHADOWS IN THE BATHROOM. Beth gets out of bed...
60

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

60

VOICES INSIDE. Beth enters, comes around the corner and sees
Jolene and Fergussen. She sits in his lap, facing him.
Shit--

FERGUSSEN

Beth runs out.
61

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

61

As Beth gets into her bed and pulls the covers up over head.
Jolene comes into the dark room and stands over Beth’s bed a
moment. She then REACHES OUT AND BRINGS HER FIST DOWN ON THE
SHAPE UNDER THE COVERS. Beth’s cry cut off as Jolene rips the
sheet back and leans close to her-JOLENE
What did you see?
Nothing.

BETH

JOLENE
That’s right. You saw nothing. So
you say nothing.

61

26.

CONTINUED:

Beth nods and Jolene then flings the sheet back over her and
quietly slips back into her own bed.
62

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

62

Beth walks to the basement door. Half-heartedly reaches for
the door, but this time-- IT’S UNLOCKED. She stands there a
moment, caught off guard. Then-63

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

63

She goes down the stairs, comes around the corner to see Mr.
Shaibel sitting at the chessboard, the pieces ready. Beth
begins cleaning the erasers. Risks glancing at him-Mr. Shaibel nods to the board. As if nothing happened.
She hesitates, then comes over and sits down across from him.
He’s already made the first move. They begin to play.
They say nothing to each other, but respond quickly to the
other’s moves. Beth glances up at him, can see tension and
likes it. She begins to push a pawn toward the sixth rank.
He responds. Moves his knight. She moves the pawn. He moves
his knight back. She smiles at the wasted move, trades her
bishop for the knight. Soon, her pawn is one move away from
becoming a queen.
He looks at it sitting there. Reaches out and angrily topples
his king. Neither of them says anything. But it’s her first
win and we see on her face that it feels pretty damn good.
MR. SHAIBEL
You’re gloating.
I’m not.

BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
It was close.
BETH
I still beat you.
MR. SHAIBEL
You could have beat me sooner.
(then)
You should learn the Sicilian
Defense.
BETH
What’s that?
He reaches for the board--

63

27.
63

CONTINUED:
MR. SHAIBEL
When white moves to king four,
black does this.
He moves the pieces on the board into position.
Then what?

BETH

He moves the knight as-MR. SHAIBEL
Knight to KB 3.
BETH
What’s KB 3?
MR. SHAIBEL
King’s bishop 3. Where I just put
the knight.
BETH
The squares have names?
MR. SHAIBEL
If you play well, they have names.
Show me.

BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
Not now.
(then)
Let’s play again.
64

A SEQUENCE OF SHOTS

64

Beth running up the corridor with the erasers. Beth in line
for her pills. Beth playing with Mr. Shaibel. Beth stashing
the pills. Beth watching the boy and girl from town making
out at the fence. His hand up her shirt. Beth’s desk empty.
Beth slamming down her queen and-65

INT. BASEMENT - DAY
BETH
--Checkmate.
Mr. Shaibel sits back, looks at her.
MR. SHAIBEL
There’s other strategies you’ll
need to learn down the road.
As he shows her the different variations:

65

65

28.
65

CONTINUED:
MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)
The Levenfish Variation...
(then)
The Najdorf Variation...
She watches, taking in every single move. He sits back.
Show me.

MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)

And now she starts moving the pieces as he did-BETH
Levenfish...
(then)
Najdorff...
She looks at him, pleased with herself. He gives her nothing.
MR. SHAIBEL
Let’s play again.
He makes a move. She stares at the board.
BETH
That isn’t one you taught me.
So?

MR. SHAIBEL

BETH
Don’t you want me to practice?
MR. SHAIBEL
I want you to play.
BETH
But is that one of those things,
like the Sicilian Defense?
MR. SHAIBEL
Those things are called Openings.
BETH
Is that one of them?
MR. SHAIBEL
Yes.
(then)
The Queen’s Gambit.
66

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
As Beth carries her tray. Jolene comes up behind her--

CONTINUED:
JOLENE
You are the ugliest white girl
ever. Your nose is ugly and your
face is ugly and your skin is like
sandpaper. You white trash cracker
bitch.

Jolene moves on and sits down with the others, leaving Beth
standing there, saying nothing. Willing herself not to cry.
67

INT. GIRL’S WARD - NIGHT

67

Beth exits the bathroom and gets into her bed. Watches the
parade of girls exiting, the TOILET FLUSHING OVER AND OVER
O.S. Can feel Jolene’s eyes on her as she passes.
MR. FERGUSSEN
Good night, good night! Parting is
such sweet sorrow, that I shall say
good night till it be morrow.
And out go the lights.

69

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

69

Mr. Shaibel watches as a now tired Beth sits down.
MR. SHAIBEL
You’re late.
She looks at the board, the WHITE PIECES in front of HER.
BETH
I’m playing white?
MR. SHAIBEL
From now on we take turns. It’s the
way the game should be played.
BETH
Then how come I couldn’t go first
before?
He doesn’t answer, nods to the board. Move. She moves the
king’s pawn. Her eyes remain fixed on the board as they play.
Whatever she’d been feeling only a few moments earlier is
gone: she’s all killer now.
He looks up at her, the barest glance, then back down at the
board. It’s not long before-Check.

BETH (CONT’D)

Another glance. He moves. And then--

69

30.
69

CONTINUED:
Mate.

BETH (CONT’D)

He looks up at her, but doesn’t scowl like he usually does
when she beats him. Instead, he reaches to the floor for a
nearly empty pint bottle. Tilts his head back and drinks.
BETH (CONT’D)
Is that whiskey?
MR. SHAIBEL
Yes, child. And don’t tell.
I won’t.

BETH

She follows the bottle as he sets it back down on the floor,
now grabs a heavy PAPERBACK off a shelf and hands it to her.
BETH (CONT’D)
Modern Chess Openings.
MR. SHAIBEL
It’s the best book for you. It will
tell you what you want to know.
Beth begins turning the pages and we glimpse headings such as
QUEEN’S PAWN OPENINGS and INDIAN DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
MR. SHAIBEL (CONT’D)
You’ll need to know chess notation
before you read it.
(off her look)
The names of the squares.
(then)
I’ll teach you now.
BETH
(looks up from the book)
Am I good enough now?
He starts to say something, then stops.
MR. SHAIBEL
How old are you?
Nine.

BETH

MR. SHAIBEL
Nine-years-old.
BETH
I’ll be ten in November.
He leans forward as much as his paunch will allow.

MR. SHAIBEL
To tell you the truth of it, child,
you are astounding.

INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

MR. ESPERO, the English teacher, a tweedy aesthete in his
thirties, paces and reads at the front of the room...
MR. ESPERO
Nobody heard him, the dead man,/
but still he lay moaning...
TRACKING BACK PAST JOLENE who glances back TO WHERE Beth sits
at her desk, staring down at her lap...

INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Beth and her mother lie on the couch in the dark.

CONTINUED:
ALICE
In fact, I’d go as far as saying
there’s nothing to be afraid of,
anywhere. Fear is just a phantom.
(suddenly thoughtful)
Huh--

She sits up, turns on the light, grabs a pen and writes that
on the wall of the trailer. Beth watches her, looks about at
the other scribbles on the walls...
ALICE (CONT’D)
Fear is just a phantom...
She shuts off the light and lies back down with Beth. Rambles
on-ALICE (CONT’D)
Strongest person is the person who
isn’t scared to be alone. See, it’s
other people you gotta worry about.
It’s other people that tell you
what to do, how to feel. And before
you know it you’re pouring your
life out in search of things other
people told you to go look for.
College is a waste of time. Only
relationship between college and
knowledge is that they rhyme. Hey-She turns the light back on and starts to scribble that last
bon mot on the wall. Beth watches her a moment, then-BETH
I thought you met papa in college.
ALICE
That’s how I know. Listen-And as she once more shuts off the light, we-74

CUT BACK TO THE GIRLS' WARD - DAY

Beth rolls onto her back.
ALICE (V.O.)
Someday you’re going to be all

JOLENE
Morning, Cracker.
Her voice is easy. No anger in it. She moves on-Jolene.

BETH

Jolene pauses, steps over to her.
JOLENE
What do you want?
BETH
I want to know what a cocksucker
is.
Jolene stares at her a moment, then laughs.
JOLENE
Shit. Okay...
(then)
You know what a cock is?
BETH
I don’t think so.
JOLENE
That’s what boys have. In the back
of the health book. Like a thumb.
(Beth nods)
Well, honey, there’s girls likes to
suck on that thumb.
Do you?

BETH

JOLENE
Haven’t tried one yet.
Beth thinks about that, then-BETH
Isn’t that where they pee?
JOLENE
I expect it wipes clean.
And she walks off, stranding Beth with her thoughts.
76

INT. BASEMENT - MORNING

76

FOLLOW BETH down the stairs to where a nice looking MAN -striped suit, tie, stands in the basement with Mr. Shaibel.

76

34.
76

CONTINUED:
MR. SHAIBEL
This is Mr. Ganz, from the chess
club.
BETH
Chess club?
MR. SHAIBEL
We play at a club.
MR. GANZ
I’m also coach of the high school
team. Duncan High?
She shakes her head, doesn’t know it.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
Would you like to play me a game?

In answer, Beth sits down on the milk crate. Mr. Shaibel
eases himself into a folding chair beside the board as Mr.
Ganz takes the janitor’s usual stool across from her.
He reaches forward in a quick nervous movement and picks up
one black and one white pawn. He cups his hand around them,
shakes them together, then extends both arms towards Beth,
his fists clenched. She just looks at him.
MR. SHAIBEL
You play the color you choose.
She reaches out and barely touches Mr. Ganz’s left hand.
This one.

BETH

He opens it to reveal the black pawn. Smiles-Sorry.

MR. GANZ

Mr. Ganz puts the pawns back and rotates the board. He makes
a move. She calmly responds. PAN AWAY NOW TO MR. SHAIBEL WHO
watches intently, almost nervously. His glances alternating
between the board and Beth. PAN PAST MR. GANZ who no longer
smiles. After a few more moves, he lays down his King.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
Well...
(quick glance at Mr.
Shaibel, then)
You certainly know the game, young
lady. Do you have a team here?
She looks at him uncomprehending.

76

35.
76

CONTINUED: (2)
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
The other girls. Do they have a
chess club?
No.

BETH

MR. GANZ
Then where do you play?
Down here.

BETH

MR. GANZ
Mr. Shaibel said you play a few
games every Sunday. What do you do
in between?
Nothing.

BETH

MR. GANZ
But how do you keep up?
BETH
I play in my head.
MR. GANZ
In your head.
BETH
On the ceiling.
He doesn’t know how to respond to that, glances up.
BETH (CONT’D)
Do you want to play another?
He hesitates. Mr. Shaibel looks at him.
MR. SHAIBEL
Now or never, Mr. Ganz. Beth has
class.
MR. GANZ
Alright. It’s your turn to play
white.
They start again. After the first few moves, he nods.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
The Reti Opening.
Again, Mr. Shaibel watches the board, watches Beth. After a
shorter period than last time--

76

36.
76

CONTINUED: (3)
BETH
Mate in three.

Mr. Ganz stares at the board. She demonstrates. Looks up at
him. As does Mr. Shaibel. Mr. Ganz topples his king, shakes
his head in disbelief.
MR. GANZ
I’ve never seen anything like it.
He stands up and walks to the furnace where Beth now sees a
SMALL SHOPPING BAG hanging.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
I have to go now. But I brought you
a present.
He hands her the shopping bag. She looks inside, no doubt
hoping to see another chess book. Something is wrapped in
pink tissue paper.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
Go ahead. Unwrap it.
She lifts it out, pulls away the loosely wrapped paper to
reveal A PINK DOLL in a blue print dress with blond hair,
puckered up mouth. Beth holds it by the arm a moment and
looks at it.
Well?

MR. GANZ (CONT’D)

She sees Mr. Shaibel giving her a look.
BETH
Thank you very much.
(then)
Do you want another game?
MR. GANZ
I really have to go. Maybe I’ll
come back next week.
77

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

Beth emerges from the basement with the doll. TRACKING BACK
with her as a trash can comes into f.g. She drops the doll
into it as she passes.
78

INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY

78

MR. HUME at the front of the room writes the name of various
vegetables on the board...

78

37.
78

CONTINUED:
MR. HUME
You should have green leafy
vegetables at least once a day,
legumes a few times a week, and
stay away from tobacco and any and
all forms of alcohol. They will
counter all the good effects and
vitamins you get from greens. I
also like to inspect my stool at
least three times a week. It should
appear firm, but not hard, a clear
sign of dehydration...

GIGGLES. Beth stares at the HEALTH BOOK on her desk, has
flipped to the back. One page is a woman and the facing page
is a man. Line drawings with shadings. Beth stares at the
two.
She looks out the window as Mr. Hume drones on. The pink
Japonicas are blooming. She looks at the trees a moment.
Trying to make sense of the pictures she’s just seen.
79

EXT. METHUEN HOME - DAY

79

The kids are all out in the sunshine. Beth is off by herself,
staring off at the fence. The local kids are there, watching
the Methuen kids. One waves. She’s walking toward them, when-Hooligans.

MRS. DEARDORFF

She turns and sees Mrs. Deardorff standing there. The other
children already heading back inside behind her.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
There’s only trouble on that side
of the fence.
The town kids melt into the woods. Mrs. Deardorff looks down
at Beth.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
But on this side... there’s love.
Friendships. Family. All you need
is right here, with us.
(then)
Unless, of course, we’re not enough
for you.
And with that, she turns and heads back inside. Over her
shoulder...
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Come along now.

INT. GIRLS' WARD - NIGHT

Beth takes several of the green pills. Lies back and begins
to play on the ceiling.
MR. GANZ (V.O.)
I brought my own set...
81

CUT TO A WOODEN BOX

81

As it’s opened to reveal polished wooden chess pieces nestled
in red felt. As they’re lifted out, we WIDEN TO REVEAL:
THE BASEMENT. A chess board of black and white squares now
set up on the table. Nobody speaks while...
Mr. Shaibel, having set up his board in the usual place, now
sets another milk crate for Mr. Ganz’s board, the two boards
side by side. Beth sits on a crate in the foot or so of space
between them. None of them speak.
Beth reaches out and hefts one of the wooden knights, feels
the weight of it, looks at the fine wood grain, the felt at
the bottom. She instantly wants this chess set.
Mr. Ganz gently takes back the knight from Beth’s hand and
sets it on its home square.
MR. GANZ
We thought you could play us both.
BETH
At the same time?
He nods. She has white for both games. She makes a move on
each board. As they both respond, She doesn’t even have to
pause to think about the continuations for either board.
She makes her moves and now looks out the window and waits.
She seems deeply relaxed, almost in a dream.
MR. GANZ
Beth? I’ve moved my bishop to
bishop 5.
BETH
(not looking)
Knight to K-5.
He nods, studies the board, moves-MR. GANZ
Bishop to Knight four.
BETH
Queen to queen four.

81

39.
81

CONTINUED:

She still hasn’t looked at the board. The bush and its pink
blossoms outside the high window has her attention.
MR. SHAIBEL
Knight to queen’s bishop three.
BETH
Bishop to knight five.
As opposed to Mr. Shaibel’s gruff tone, Mr. Ganz’s voice now
has a strange softness...
MR. GANZ
Pawn to knight three.
BETH
Queen to rook four check.
Behind her, JUST OUT OF FOCUS, Mr. Ganz inhales sharply. A
moment, then-MR. GANZ
King to bishop one.
BETH
(still not turning)
That’s mate in three. First check
is with the knight. The king has
the two dark squares, and the
bishop checks it. Then the knight
mates.
MR. GANZ
Sweet Jesus.
He shakes his head, checks his watch.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
I have to go now.
He stands, grabs his satchel, remembers something, pulls out
a CAMERA... looks at Beth...
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
Would you mind, Beth, if I took
your picture? I’d love to tell the
kids in the chess club about you.
She’s not sure. Looks at Mr. Shaibel.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
How about you stand beside Mr.
Shaibel?
She gets up, moves to Mr. Shaibel’s side. Both are awkward.
She rests her hand on his shoulder. Startling him.

A FLASH AND-82

INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY

82

The kids are all watching a movie called “HOW TO ACT AT
DINNERTIME.”
ON BETH
Watching the movie with a bored detachment as now behind her
Fergussen makes his way into the room and scans their faces.
He spots Beth, sitting with Jolene. He leans over the older
girl and taps Beth on the shoulder.
Jolene notes the closeness of his lean, gives him a look, as
Beth gets up and follows Fergussen out of the room-83

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

83

A frightened Beth follows a silent as usual Fergussen, her
thick brown shoes squeaking on the linoleum behind him.
He leads her to the door with the frosted glass window, HELEN
DEARDORFF. SUPERINTENDANT. Beth takes a breath-84

INT. MRS. DEARDORFF’S OFFICE - SAME

84

Beth walks in and sees Mr. Ganz -- in a brown suit -- smile
self-consciously and half rise from a red armchair, but sit
back down as-MRS. DEARDORFF
Close the door, please, Elizabeth.
Beth closes the door, looks at Mrs. Deardorff, seated at the
desk, peering at her over tortoise shell glasses.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Mr. Ganz tells me that you are a-(adjusts her glasses)
--gifted child.
Mrs. Deardorff looks at her as if she expects her to deny it.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
He has an unusual request to make.
He would like you to be taken to
the high school on...

84

41.

CONTINUED:
She looks at Mr. Ganz.
MR. GANZ
On Thursday.
MRS. DEARDORFF
On Thursday. In the afternoon. He
maintains that you are a phenomenal
chess player. He would like you to
perform for the chess club.
Beth says nothing, still frightened.
MR. GANZ
We have a dozen members, and I was
suggesting to Mrs. Deardorff that
you come and play all of them in a
simultaneous.
In a what?

BETH

MR. GANZ
At the same time.
MRS. DEARDORFF
We like to give our girls a chance
for experience outside whenever we
can.
Beth looks at her. Really?
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
But... I am a bit wary of letting
Elizabeth go off to the local high
school.
MR. GANZ
I would chaperone. I’d pick her up
and bring her to the school, then
bring her straight back here.
MRS. DEARDORFF
I was thinking a young lady might
also accompany her.
MR. GANZ
I assumed that you would come. As
my guest.
Beth watches as Mrs. Deardorff blushes at that one.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Oh, no... I couldn’t possibly
abandon my duties here.

84

42.
84

CONTINUED: (2)
MR. GANZ
Well then what if Shirley Munson,
club treasurer and one of my best
students, comes along?
Mrs. Deardorff processes that a moment-MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
I’m sure I could get someone from
the local paper to be there, write
it up. I imagine that it could be a
very good thing, fund raising wise,
to have a story like this.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Yes, I’m sure it would be.
He gives her a warm smile.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
What do you say Elizabeth? Do you
want to go play chess at the high
school?
BETH
Yes. I’d like to.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Okay. It’s settled, then. Mr. Ganz
and-- Charlotte, did you say?
Shirley.

MR. GANZ

MRS. DEARDORFF
Shirley yes. They will pick you up,
let’s say, after lunch on Thursday?
Perfect.

MR. GANZ

He gets up to go. Smiles at Beth.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
See you then.
He leaves and Beth is turning to follow when-Elizabeth.

MRS. DEARDORFF

Beth turns back, now alone with Mrs. Deardorff.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
I’m told that you’ve been playing
chess with our custodian.

Beth isn’t sure what to say
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
With Mr. Shaibel.
BETH
Yes, ma’am.
MRS. DEARDORFF
This is very irregular, Elizabeth.
Have you gone to the basement?
BETH
Yes, ma’am.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Well, we can’t have that. As much
as Methuen believes in excellence,
we can’t have you playing chess in
the basement.
Beth looks crestfallen as a PHONE BEGINS RINGING IN THE OUTER
OFFICE.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
I believe we have chess sets in the
game closet. I’ll have Fergussen
look into it.
And now a LIGHT BEGINS TO FLASH on the phone on her desk. She
reaches for the phone as-MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
That will be all, Elizabeth. Mind
your manners at the high school and
be sure your nails are clean.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Beth opens a dictionary, rifles the pages until she finds

go, looks down into it, sees TWO ORANGE VITAMIN TABLETS and
turns back to him.
BETH
There’s one missing.
FERGUSSEN
That’s it. Next.
Beth doesn’t move as the girl behind her pushes against her.
GIRL BEHIND HER
It’s my turn, Harmon.
BETH
Where are the green ones?
FERGUSSEN
You don’t get them anymore.
Beth stands on tiptoe, looks behind Fergussen to the BIG
GLASS JAR FULL OF GREEN PILLS. Still there and still nearly a
third full. She points at it-BETH
There they are. Right behind you.
FERGUSSEN
I know where they are, Harmon. But
I’m not giving you any. It’s a new
State law-- No more tranquilizers
for kids. Go figure.
GIRL BEHIND HER
Harmon. It’s my turn.
Fergussen waves at her.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Beth stands at the sink brushing her teeth when Jolene comes
up to the sink beside her, begins brushing her own teeth.
JOLENE
I hear tell you’re going to exhibit
yourself.
Beth looks at her.
JOLENE (CONT’D)
Going to play chess in front of
people.
BETH
Who told you?
JOLENE
Child, I just know things.
BETH
Did Mrs. Deardorff tell you?
JOLENE
Never go near that lady. It was
Fergussen. He told me you were
going to the high school downtown.
Day after tomorrow.
Fergussen?

BETH

JOLENE
As you well know, he and I been
friendly from time to time.
(then)
I appreciate you keeping your mouth
shut. I wasn’t sure you could.
Beth nods. Jolene resumes brushing...
BETH
Did Fergussen give you any green
pills? Extra ones?
Jolene turns and looks at her hard. Then her face softens.

91

46.
91

CONTINUED:
JOLENE
No, honey. I wish he would. But
they got the whole state after ‘em
for what they been doing with those
pills.
BETH
They’re still there. In the big
jar.
JOLENE
That a fact? I ain’t noticed.
(keeps looking at Beth)
You having withdraw symptoms?
BETH
I don’t know. What are those?
JOLENE
You getting edgy?
(then)
Yeah, you are.

Jolene finishes drying her hair. Beth stares up at her, the
light coming behind her frizzy hair, her big wide eyes. Beth
looks at herself in the mirror, far less impressed.
JOLENE (CONT’D)
You look around, they’ll be some
jumpy orphans around here the next
few days.

Do you play the King’s Gambit?

SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Did you know Chess is older than
Checkers?
No.

BETH

SHIRLEY
By like four hundred years.
They’re at the front door when-Wait!

JOLENE (V.O.)

They all turn to see Jolene come running up to them. She
gives Mr. Ganz one of her sly smiles...
JOLENE
Is it okay if I talk to Beth for
just a second? Wish her luck?
MR. GANZ
(checks his watch, then)
Sure. Go ahead.
Jolene takes Beth hastily aside and puts something in Beth’s
hand. Kisses her on the forehead.
Good luck.

JOLENE

She then waves at Mr. Ganz, and skips off to class. Beth
looks at her hand, sees THREE GREEN PILLS.
96

INT. DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

96

Quiet as Beth now follows Shirley and Mr. Ganz through the
school. She takes in the posters and banners that line the
walls. The trophy cases. Another world. All of this-97

INT. DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

97

A SERIES OF SHOTS-- Desks stacked in a corner. Three folding
tables set up in the shape of a U in the center of the room.

97

48.
97

CONTINUED:

On each table are four green and beige paper chessboards with
plastic pieces. Metal chairs sit inside the U, facing the
black pieces. And finally, “WELCOME BETH HARMON” written on
the blackboard.
Beth stands in the room, taking it all in. A BELL RINGS and
now the hallway echoes with FOOTSTEPS and SHOUTS. Students,
mostly boys, begin to come into the classroom. Some big as
men.
Beth is half the size of these easy, insolent students with
their loud voices and their bright sweaters. The room fills
until Beth is blocked by their bodies and she disappears.
MR. GANZ
Take your seats and be quiet,
please.
As they all begin to sit and REVEAL HER ONCE MORE.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
Charles Levy will take Board Number
One since he’s our top player.
Beth looks at CHARLES LEVY as he takes his proper seat.
MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
The rest can sit where they want to.
There will be no talking during play.
And like that, everyone is quiet and looking at Beth. She
looks back at them, something rising in her face. Hatred.
BETH
Do I start now?
MR. GANZ
With board number one.
BETH
And then I go to the next one?
MR. GANZ
That’s right.
She steps over to the first board where Charles Levy sits,
picks up the king’s pawn and moves it to the fourth rank.
She goes from board to board making the same move. At one
point she hesitates as she sees no one is responding. She
looks at Mr. Ganz-MR. GANZ (CONT’D)
They can’t respond until you’ve
opened at every board.

97

CONTINUED: (2)

49.
97

Oh. She continues making her opening move on each board. She
gets to the last board, moves, then turns and watches as
everyone responds at once. She starts going around again...
BETH (V.O.)
What surprised me was how bad they
played...

attacks...

Beth shrugs, eats another chocolate-BETH

INT. DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

101

As Beth calmly takes apart the Chess Club Number One...
BETH (V.O.)
I had his pieces tied up in fifteen
moves. I mated him in six more with
a knight-rook combination.
As Beth moves from board to board, the energy of her amazing
mind crackles in the room for everyone bearing witness. She
beats the last player, steps back and looks around her-BETH (V.O.)
Mr. Ganz told me that I beat them
all in an hour and twenty minutes.
Captured pieces sit in clusters beside each board. A few
students stare at her, but most avoid her eyes. They’re
afraid of her. SCATTERED APPLAUSE and--

Quietly watching her. What’s that on his face? Concern?
Admiration? Both? Hard to say. Finally-MR. SHAIBEL
You should get back.
She gets up, slides the box his way.
BETH
You can have the rest.
She leaves. He stares at the box. Lost in thought.

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - “VITAMIN LINE” - DAY

Hello, Samantha.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Dark. THE LIGHT COMES ON to reveal Beth coming down the
stairs. Mr. Shaibel isn’t here. She looks at the board,
around the room, sees the TOOLS hanging on the pegboard
opposite the furnace.
106

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

106

The Saturday movie, The Robe, plays for the entirety of the
Methuen Home. The staff sit in a row of chairs at the back.
Beth slouches in her chair, can barely focus on the movie.
Her legs crossed angrily in that double cross over...
She glances back at the faculty and staff, spies Fergussen
near the door, proctoring. She gets up and edges her way to
him and whispers...
Bathroom.

BETH

He nods, his eyes, along with everyone else’s, on Victor
Mature, bare-chested in the arena.
107

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME

107

She hurries down the hallway, slips into-108

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - SAME

108

She moves past the racks of Christian Endeavour magazines and
the Readers Digest Condensed Books to the far wall and the
pad-locked window that says PHARMACY.
She grabs one of the wooden stools from the room and drags it
to the window. She climbs onto it so her face is level with a
HASP and PADLOCK.
There’s no one in the room, so the only sounds are the
gladiatorial shouts from the movie in the library.

108

CONTINUED:

52.
108

The window up close is made of frosted glass with chicken
wire in it and framed in painted wood. Beth examines the
screws that hold the painted hasp.
The shouts from the film arena rises to a roar, and the
volume of the frenetic music rises with it.
She puts the blade of the screwdriver in the slit of the
screw and twists it as hard as she can. Nothing happens.
She grips the screwdriver in both hands, hunches her
shoulders together and twists with all she has.
SOMETHING SQUEAKS and the screw loosens. She keeps twisting
until she can take it out the rest of the way and put it in
her blouse pocket.
Now she goes to work on the other screw. She gets that one
out and puts it in her pocket. The end of the hasp comes
loose by itself with the padlock still hanging there, the
other end supported by the two screws that hold it to the
window frame.
She pulls open the window, leaning back so it can go by her,
and puts her head inside. The light’s off, but she can see
the outline of the big jar. She puts her arms inside the
opening, stands on tiptoe, pushes herself as far forward as
she can, until her belly is on the sill.
She begins to wriggle and her feet come away from the stool.
She keeps on wriggling forward, feels and hears her blouse
ripping on the sharp edge of the sill, but keeps going.
Her hands finally reach the narrow metal table just below the
window. She inches forward again and her weight comes down on
her hands. She pushes a few boxes aside and makes a place for
herself on the table.
She lets her weight come forward until she’s able to flop
onto the table, twisting at the last moment so that she
doesn’t fall off it.
She takes a couple of deep breaths and climbs down. There’s
enough light for her to see alright. She walks to the far
wall and faces the dimly visible JAR.
She lifts the glass cover and sits it silently on the table
under the window. She then slowly reaches inside with both
hands, burying them up to the wrists. She takes a deep breath
and removes her right hand with a fistful of pills.
She doesn’t count them, but simply puts them in her mouth and
swallows them ALL.
She stuffs three handfuls of pills into her skirt pocket. She
looks around.

108

53.
108

CONTINUED: (2)

On the wall beside the window is a DIXIE CUP DISPENSER. She’s
able to reach it on tiptoe and pulls down four paper cups.
She fills them one at a time. Then steps back and looks at
the jar. The level is now half of what it was. Whatever.
She moves to the door, to go out that way, but can’t open it.
It’s locked in some serious way and she’s now a bit unsteady.
She looks at the four Dixie cups, and then at the window. How
can she climb out with them?
She grips the doorknob. Controls her breathing. Carries the
cups two at a time to the table under the window. She looks
back at the jar. At the remaining pills. And thinks.
She takes the jar to the table and pours the contents of the
Dixie cups back inside. She climbs onto the table and puts
her head out the window into the empty multi purpose room...
The jar of pills is only inches from her knee. She wriggles
her way through the window and onto the stool. Standing up
high there, she leans forward and dreamily grabs the jar by
the rim in both hands.
She goes limp, stares down at the green pills in the jar,
STATELY MUSIC now coming from the library. She lies there
over the sill like a rag doll.
As her eyes lose focus, the green in the jar becomes a bright
luminous blur-Elizabeth!
Mama?
Elizabeth!

WOMAN’S VOICE
BETH
WOMAN’S VOICE

She hoists the jar in a kind of slow motion, lifting it with
both hands as she turns, the bottom of the jar hitting the
window ledge with a dull ringing sound and coming loose from
her hands and-IN HER STONED POV
--exploding on the edge of the stool at her feet. The
fragments, mixed with hundreds of green pellets, cascading to
the linoleum floor. Bits of glass caught like rhinestones and
lay in place while the green pills roll outward like a bright
waterfall toward Mrs. Deardorff.
Elizabeth!

Behind her stands Fergussen in his white pants and T-shirt.
Next to him stands the other teachers, and behind them,
crowding to see what had happened, are the other children.
All of them staring at her, high on the miniature stage of
her stool with her hands a foot apart as though she’s still
holding the jar.

INT. GIRLS’ WARD - DAY

Beth wakes up. She’s alone in the Girl’s Ward. The only one
in bed. Fergussen comes to the door-FERGUSSEN
Welcome back.
She blinks at him, looks around. Swallows, winces-BETH
My throat hurts.
FERGUSSEN
I bet it does. They put a tube down
it. Pumped your stomach.
She looks at her stomach.
FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
I guess you don’t remember me
driving you to the hospital either?
No.

BETH

FERGUSSEN
Jesus, kid. I thought Deardorff
would explode.
Beth just sits there, tries to get her bearings.
FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
How many did you take? Twenty?
BETH
I didn’t count.
FERGUSSEN
Well, I hope you enjoyed ‘em. It’ll
be cold turkey tomorrow.
Beth sees her clothes at the foot of the bed. She’s putting
them on when she reaches into her pocket and makes a
discovery: TWENTY-SOME PILLS STILL INSIDE. So many she has to
take her toothbrush out of the holder to get them all in.
MRS. DEARDORFF (V.O.)
I pray you’ve learned your lesson.

Beth stands facing Mrs. Deardorff. Several of her teachers
ring the room.
MRS. DEARDORFF
Your behavior has come as a
profound shock to all of us.
Nothing-- nothing-- in the history
of the Methuen Home has been so
deplorable. It must not happen
again.
BETH
I can’t sleep without the pills.
MRS. DEARDORFF
All the more reason why you should
not have them.
BETH
You shouldn’t have given them to us
in the first place.
MRS. DEARDORFF
I will not have back talk from a
child.
(stands, leans forward)
If you speak to me like that again,
you will regret it.
Beth already regrets it, takes a step back. Mrs. Deardorff
adjusts her glasses.
MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
Your library and playground
privileges have been suspended. You
will not attend the Saturday movies
and you will be in bed promptly at
eight o’clock in the evenings. Do
you understand.
(Beth nods)
Answer me.
Yes.

BETH

MRS. DEARDORFF
Furthermore, you will be in chapel
thirty minutes early and will be
responsible for setting up the
chairs and then putting them away
once chapel has finished. If you
are in any way remiss in this duty,
Miss Lonsdale has been instructed
to report to me.

MRS. DEARDORFF (CONT'D)
If you are seen whispering to
another child in chapel or in any

given ten demerits. You understand
the meaning of ten demerits,
Elizabeth?
(Beth nods)
Answer me.
Yes.

56.

BETH

MRS. DEARDORFF
Miss Lonsdale informs me that you
have often left chapel for long
periods. That will end. You will
remain in chapel for the full
ninety minutes on Sundays. You will
write a summary of each Sunday talk
and have it on my desk by Monday
morning. And Elizabeth...

Mrs. Deardorff now sits back down.

As Beth gets to the front, the hasp has been replaced with a
much stronger one. Four screws each. Fergussen looks at her

Wanna help yourself?
She shakes her head and holds out her hand. He hands the
vitamin to her, watches her swallow it and move off.

you.
BETH
It felt funny.
JOLENE
Shit, I bet it felt good.

What you gonna do at night?
BETH
I’m gonna stay awake as long as I
can reading my book, learning the
Sicilian Defense.
Jolene just looks at her. What?
BETH (CONT’D)
There’s fifty-seven pages about it
in the book with a hundred and
seventy lines stemming from P-QB4.
I’m gonna memorize them and play
through them all in my mind.
Poor mind.

from the basement carrying erasers. Beth tries to see down
the stairs as the door slowly closes behind him.

INT. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - SAME

A CHRISTMAS TREE in the center. Decorations ring the room.
JOLENE (V.O.)
There’s always more adoptions
around Christmas.

INT. GIRL’S WARD - DAY

118

Jolene and Beth look at TWO EMPTY BEDS.
BETH
Both pretty ones.
JOLENE
Both blonde.
Jolene walks out of the room. Beth starts to put on her socks
when Fergussen comes into the ward, calls from behind her-FERGUSSEN
Harmon!
(She turns to him)
You’re moving. Follow me.
She goes with him across the ward to the far wall where one
of the empty beds sits, under the window. It’s a bit larger
than the others and has more space around it.
FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
You can put your things in the
nightstand.
She looks at him. Really?
FERGUSSEN (CONT’D)
It’ll be nicer over here.
She looks around the ward. This is the best bed in the ward.
Fergussen is making a note on his clipboard when she reaches
out and touches his arm-Thank you.

BETH

CONTINUED:
Thank you.

FERGUSSEN

He nods towards Jolene. For keeping quiet. He walks out. Beth
sits down on the bed and stares out the window at the falling
snow.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

119

The kids all come out of class. Beth looks down the corridor
and sees Mr. Shaibel at the end of the long hallway mopping.
While the kids go the other way, towards the door that leads
to the yard for recess, she starts down the hallway to him...
She stops where the floor is wet and stands for a good long
while before he finally looks up at her.
BETH
They won’t let me play anymore. I’m
sorry.
(he says nothing)
I’m being punished. I-She looks at his face. It registers nothing.
BETH (CONT’D)
Please... Mr. Shaibel...
She touches his arm. He freezes.
BETH (CONT’D)
Can you help me?
He looks at her for a moment as if he’s going to speak. But
instead, he resumes mopping. Beth watches him, then-BETH (CONT’D)
I wish I could play more with you.
She then turns and walks back down the hall. She watches as
he mops his way to the end, then, glances once her way, and
then drops the mop in the bucket and opens a door-Beth stands there in the hallway watching as he rolls the
bucket inside, the door shutting behind him. She stares at
the door another moment, then turns and runs away.

INT. GIRLS’ WARD - NIGHT

120

As Mr. Fergussen sticks his head in the ward and shuts off
the lights...
MR. FERGUSSEN
The darkest night is the bridge to
the brightest tomorrow.

Beth reaches under the mattress and takes one of her stashed
green pills. She sees Jolene slip into bed, the two share a
look, then lie back on their respective beds.
ON BETH FROM ABOVE
As she looks up at the ceiling. And now... slowly... THE
UPSIDE DOWN PIECES LINE UP IN OUR PERIPHERAL-FROM BETH UP TO THE CEILING
As she begins to play a game. The pieces move faster and
faster. Before long, she’s playing two games. Now three.
Four. Five... and so on. The light in the room changing,
going from dark to slowly lighter and... THE PIECES FADE.
BOOM DOWN as Fergussen sticks his head in the doorway of the
Girls’ Ward, now wearing a beard.
FERGUSSEN
For crying out loud-- get up you
two! You’re gonna miss breakfast.
121

INT. GIRLS' WARD - SEVERAL YEARS LATER - DAY

121

He moves off. And now JOLENE sits up in the b.g. and yawns.
SHE’S SEVERAL YEARS OLDER. She pulls a pack of cigarettes
from a spot behind her bed, lights up, looks towards CAMERA.
JOLENE
Hey. Cracker.
And now A TEENAGE BETH sits up in the f.g. Hair in her face.
Jolene opens the window by her bed, lights up and tosses the
pack to Beth-JOLENE (CONT’D)
You don’t wanna miss another
delicious breakfast, do you?
BETH
(shakes out a smoke)
I’ve been dreaming about it.
She opens her own window, lights up and they both smile.

EXT. METHUEN HOME - DAY

PULLING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW as the two of them sit there
smoking, looking out at their uncertain futures. A SEDAN
PULLS INTO IMMEDIATE F.G.
FROM THE WINDOW
As Beth and Jolene watch as a MAN in a grey suit gets out of
the driver’s side. And now a WOMAN in blue dress and sweater
gets out of the passenger side.

JOLENE
Who do we think they come for?

The woman pauses, looks right up at the window, right up at
Beth. There’s a moment between the two of them, broken by-MAN
Alma? Are you coming?
The woman smiles at Beth, then follows the man into the
building and we then-CUT TO BLACK
