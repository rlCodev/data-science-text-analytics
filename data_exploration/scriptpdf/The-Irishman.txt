FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

1
SOMEONE’S POV - MAYBE OURS
Moving along a hallway of an ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY,
past doors - some open, some closed - as if looking for
somebody - and maybe not for benign reasons.
FRANK V/O
When I was young, I thought house
painters painted houses.
We glimpse some of the elderly men and women in the
rooms, but like everyone else in their lives, disregard
them and keep looking for someone else.
FRANK V/O
What did I know?
We turn a corner into another hallway, keep looking FRANK V/O
I was a working guy.
We drift into a rec room where more elderly men and women
watch TV, play cards, stare off at nothing FRANK V/O
A business agent for Teamster
Local One-O-Seven out of South
Philadelphia...
We approach a particular man sitting apart from the
others in a wheelchair. He’s about 80, better dressed
than everyone else here, white dress shirt, cuffs
monogrammed FJS, dark slacks, aviator sunglasses.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
One of a thousand working
stiffs...
This is who we’ve been looking for - Frank Sheeran perhaps to kill him. But he pays no attention to us,
even as we come in close enough to see his gold watch
encircled with diamonds, and the distinctive ring made
from a gold coin on a finger.
INT. EMPTY HOUSE - A BLANK WALL - DAY
We see a young man’s hand with the same gold and diamond
encrusted watch and diamond pinky ring raise a gun at an
unseen target.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
... until I wasn’t anymore...

2
TWO QUICK GUNSHOTS to the back of an UNKNOWN MAN’S head.
The blank wall explodes in red, as though a bucket of
blood had been thrown against it. The blood begins to
slowly ooze down the wall covering it with red streaks.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
... And started painting houses
myself.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
BACK in the ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, Frank gives us a
moment to grasp what he’s said. Then:
FRANK
In this particular matter, the
whole thing was built around the
wedding.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
A wedding invitation sits on a bureau next to Frank’s
gold watch.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
Bill Bufalino’s daughter was
getting married in Detroit.
Frank puts the watch on his wrist. The gold ring is on
his finger next to his wedding band. He’s quite a bit
younger than when we saw him at the assisted living
facility. About 55.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
Bill was a Teamster lawyer, but
more important, he was Russell
Bufalino’s cousin.
He zips a suit and shirt into a garment bag like a body
in a body bag.
EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
Frank arranges luggage in the trunk of his black Lincoln
Continental, leaving a space for more.
FRANK V/O
Russell didn’t want to fly.
wanted to take care of some
business along the way.
(MORE)

He

3
FRANK V/O (CONT'D)
Business in Russell’s case means
one thing: collecting money. So
we’d drive. Him and his wife
Carrie and me and Irene.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
While his wife Irene talks on the kitchen phone to
Russell’s wife Carrie about what to wear, Frank marks
towns on a AAA map of the eastern states that he knows
Russell will want to stop.
FRANK V/O
We’d take 476 out of Philly up to
Pittston - then I-80 West through
the rest of Pennsylvania - across
Ohio to Toledo - then 75 North to
Detroit.
EXT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - PITTSTON, PA - DAY - 1975
Irene and Carrie smoke cigarettes on the sidewalk
outside a modest suburban house while Frank and Russell
Bufalino add his and his wife’s luggage to the trunk.
Russell’s about 15 years older than Frank.
FRANK V/O
It was gonna take three days with
all the business breaks and
cigarette stops since Russell
didn’t allow smoking in the car.
He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer
Lansky convinced him to stop when
they were getting kicked out of
their casinos in Cuba and getting
shot at by Castro. I don’t know.
It might have been one of those:
“Please-God-if-I-ever-get-out-ofthis-alive-I’ll-never-smoke-againthings”, but I do know that from
Castro on Russ wouldn’t let
anybody smoke in the car, even
Carrie.
INT. FRANK’S LINCOLN - WILKES-BARRE - DAY - 1975
Frank drives along a city street with Russell in front,
the women in back, Carrie putting on some lipstick.
CARRIE
Can we stop soon?

4
BUFALINO
We’re not even to the highway.
CARRIE
You won’t stop on the highway.
BUFALINO
It’s not safe to stop on the
highway.
CARRIE
Then we’ll smoke in the car.
BUFALINO
The smoke’s bad for my cataracts.
CARRIE
I’ll crack the window.
BUFALINO
Carrie - I made a vow.
CARRIE
And I can’t smoke in the car?
BUFALINO
Or on the highway.
Carrie isn’t having it; snaps open her little gold lamé
cigarette clutch. She cracks the window. Russell glances
over at Frank through his thick glasses and sighs.
EXT. HIGHWAY I-80 - DAY - 1975
While Irene and Carrie sit on a guard rail smoking,
Russell leans on the hood looking off at cars and trucks
driving past. Frank comes over.
FRANK
You see where we are?
BUFALINO
What are the odds?
They regard the unremarkable surroundings like they
weren’t so unremarkable, including a Stuckey’s/Texaco gas
station up the road. A tractor-trailer roars past and INT/EXT. HIGHWAY I-80 - DAY - 1956
Frank, in his 30s, behind the wheel of a refrigerated
truck.

5
He’s driving on the same highway he’ll drive to Detroit
on twenty-some years later with Russell and their wives,
when the engine starts making noises it shouldn’t. Up
ahead through the windshield is the same Stuckey’s-Texaco
station EXT. STUCKEY’S/TEXACO GAS STATION - I-80 - DAY - 1956
Frank has the truck’s hood open and is listening to the
misfiring engine. He has a cloth tool kit, with various
sized wrenches, open on the truck’s fender. Russell - who
he doesn’t know yet - appears out of nowhere wearing no
glasses.
BUFALINO
What’s the matter, kid?
I don’t know.

FRANK
Sounds funny.

Frank runs the engine manually from under the hood as
Russell listens.
BUFALINO
(finally)
It’s your timing chain.
He selects a wrench from Frank’s tools and makes an
adjustment.
In a few moments the engine is sounding normal again.
BUFALINO
This fix won’t last forever.
Russell wipes his hands on a rag and heads off.
FRANK
Jeezus! Thanks. What do I owe you?
Russell waves back, ‘nothing,’ and Frank watches him walk
into the gas station.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
I thought maybe he owned the gas
station. He owned something, you
could tell.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
Frank where we left him, in the wheelchair in the rec
room with his aviator glasses.

6
FRANK
It turns out he owned the whole
road.
INT. MOTHER OF SORROWS CHURCH - DAY - 1950
A priest performs a baptism. Frank and his first wife
Mary’s second daughter, Peggy.
There are so few people in attendance, it seems like a
private ceremony. But it’s just they don’t have a lot of
friends or relatives.
INT. LIVE CHICKEN MARKET - DAY - FLASHBACK - 1946
“SKINNY RAZOR” swiftly runs his razor across a squawking
chicken’s neck that gushes blood. Skinny then dumps the
fluttering chicken head-first into a metal funnel to let
it bleed out while grabbing his next victim.
FRANK V/O
Skinny Razor got the name because
he started out as a kid killing
live chickens at his father’s
butcher shop.
EXT. SOUTH PHILLY - NIGHT - 1956
A place called The Friendly Lounge according to its sign
which has “STEAKS AND CHOPS” in neon.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT - 1956
Frank hangs out with some other truck drivers, all
Italians except him. Across the room at another table
sits a group of mid-level mob guys, eating dinner.
Indicating one of them JOHNNY
That’s Skinny Razor. He owns
the place. He shylocks and runs a
little book out of the joint. You
should meet him.
FRANK
Did you say razor?
JOHNNY
He used to work at a butcher shop.

7
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - LATER - 1956
Frank’s POV of Johnny talking to Skinny and gesturing for
Frank to come over.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - CONTINUED - 1956
Frank and Johnny standing at Skinny’s table.
JOHNNY
Skinny, this is Frank.
SKINNY
You got something for me?
FRANK
You like steak?
SKINNY
I own the joint don’t I?
FRANK
I deliver steak.
SKINNY
That’s what I hear.
FRANK
I could deliver you steak.
Johnny gives Skinny a nod that says “yes”.
Have a drink.

SKINNY

As the bartender serves drinks, Skinny toasts the group.
EXT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY - 1956
It’s summer. As loading dock workers in short sleeves
carry hindquarters and hang them in Frank’s refrigerated
truck, he signs for the load - 25 beef carcasses.
FRANK V/O
It’s harder to steal in the
summer when the weather’s nice.
He shuts the truck’s rear doors.
an aluminum seal on the lock.

The yard manager slaps

8
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY - 1956
Frank backs up to the store’s loading dock and climbs
out as the store’s manager approaches with a clipboard
and breaks the aluminum seal. Workers begin unloading
the hindquarters, the store manager noting the number.
FRANK V/O
Winter’s a different story.
EXT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY - DEC. 1956
The same loading dock as before, but now it’s winter.
Snow on the ground.
INT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY - DEC. 1956
A heater glows in the yard manager’s dock office.
signs for 25 hindquarters.

Frank

YARD MANAGER
It’s freezing out there.
FRANK
I don’t mind it.
YARD MANAGER
Not me. I hate it. Will you do me
a favor and put on the seal?
FRANK
Sure. I’ve gotta be out there
anyway.
The Yard Manager hands Frank the aluminum seal, and turns
away to warm his hands over a small floor heater.
I owe you one.

YARD MANAGER

EXT. MEAT COMPANY - CONTINUOUS - DEC. 1956
Frank emerges from the office, crosses the freezing cold
dock, shuts the doors of the loaded truck but pockets the
seal instead of putting it on the lock.
EXT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - LATER - DAY - DEC. 1956
Skinny watches guys carry five hindquarters into the back
of the Friendly Lounge as he pays Frank cash.

9
After the delivery is done and Skinny goes inside, Frank
puts the seal on the truck door’s lock.
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - LATER - DAY - DEC. 1956
The store MANAGER rubs his gloves together to restore
some circulation and breaks the seal on the lock.
FRANK
(to some dock guys)
I’ll give you a hand.
INT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY - DEC. 1956
Frank helps the dock workers carry the 20 (not 25)
hindquarters to the store’s walk-in refrigerator. They
hang them on one side and leave, but Frank stays behind
and re-hangs five hindquarters that were already there
on the other side to those he just delivered.
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY - DEC. 1956
Back on the dock, the store manager signs for the
shipment - 25 side of beef - and Frank hops back into
his truck.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT - DEC. 1956
Frank and Johnny and drivers at the bar with Christmas
decorations. Skinny and mob friends eating Frank’s
stolen steak. Skinny waves Frank over to the table.
Delicious.

SKINNY

FRANK
It’s all Prime meat. I don’t go
near “Choice”.
SKINNY
Then keep’em coming, Frank.
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY - FEB. 1957
Another winter’s day. The store manager comes out to
Frank’s truck and breaks the seal on the doors.

10
FRANK V/O
First I was stealing five
hindquarters at a time. Then ten.
Twelve. Things were missing
everywhere I went. I was doing
real good, but then The doors open revealing no hindquarters inside.
looks mystified.
What the fuck?

Frank

FRANK

STORE MANAGER
What the fuck is this?
FRANK
I don’t know, it’s not my job to
load. Maybe the loaders didn’t do
their job.
Everyone on the dock looks at Frank.
STORE MANAGER
You didn’t notice you were driving
a light horse?
FRANK
No, I thought I had a good horse.
EXT. LOCAL 107 - PHILADELPHIA - DAY - 1957
The familiar two-horses-and-a-wheel International
Brotherhood of Teamsters logo on the door of the Local.
BILL (PRE-LAP)
Under the contract, thanks to
Jimmy Hoffa, management can only
fire a driver on specific charges.
INT. LOCAL 107 - DAY - 1957
Frank sits with Teamster lawyer Bill Bufalino, whose
daughter’s wedding Frank and Russell will drive across
three states to attend 25 years later.
BILL
Ever show up late?
No.

FRANK

11
BILL
Any moving violations?
No.

FRANK

BILL
You drink on the job?
No.

FRANK

BILL
Ever hit anybody?
On the job?
Yeah.
No.

FRANK
BILL
FRANK

The lawyer nods to himself - all this seems to be
satisfactory to him - and he seems to have exhausted the
list of fireable offenses.
FRANK
Stealing isn’t grounds?
BILL
Can they prove it?
FRANK
I don’t think so.
Then no.

BILL

They regard each other.
BILL
If they could prove it, all
they’re going to want from you is
names. Accomplices. You could
keep your job and walk away.
Would you give them names to keep
your job?
No.
Bill nods.

FRANK

That’s the right answer.

Then -

12
BILL
You know I don’t care if you did
it or not.
Yeah.

FRANK

BILL
It makes no difference to me.
here to defend you. Right?
Yeah.

I’m

FRANK

BILL
(whispers)
But did you?
Frank isn’t sure if he’s supposed to admit it or not to
his lawyer. Eventually FRANK
I work hard for that company when
I’m not stealing from them.
Bill smiles. He likes Frank. He won’t be the last to
appreciate his honest dishonesty.
INT. COURTROOM - DAY - 1957
At the plaintiff’s table - the Food Fair lawyers. At
the defense table - Frank and his lawyer, Bill Bufalino,
who addresses the judge BILL
Your Honor, if this were about
right and wrong, the company would
have sought Mr. Sheeran’s
dismissal. They didn’t. They
only brought charges against Mr.
Sheeran because the company hoped
that he would name the
conspirators he couldn’t give them
because they don’t exist. They
don’t exist because he never stole
anything. He never stole anything
because he’s an exemplary employee
who in eight years has never taken
a day of sick leave.
(MORE)

13
BILL (CONT'D)
The only rule he ever broke was
his own union’s, by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck
to their refrigerators in the dead
of winter.
With that and all else he’s heard, the judge renders
judgement JUDGE
I’m dismissing this case with a
warning FRANK
Yes, your Honor.
JUDGE
Not you, Mr. Sheeran. The
plaintiff. You bring another
workingman before this court with
threats instead of evidence,
believe me, you’ll be sorry.
(shakes his head)
If I owned stock in this company,
I’d sell it.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1957
ANGELO BRUNO, humble-looking and simply dressed is seated
at a table with Skinny Razor when Frank and Bill Bufalino
walk in. Skinny whispers something to Bruno.
FRANK V/O
I don’t know how he did it, and
I’m not gonna ask.
Angelo Bruno watches Frank walk from the entrance to the
hat checking area with Bill Bufalino.
FRANK V/O
All I know is that Bill Bufalino
got me out of a case where I
should’a gone down for the count.
Angelo Bruno continues to watch as a WAITRESS helps Frank
and Bill with their coats.
FRANK V/O
Instead, we went out celebrating
and I met what was gonna turn out
to be the rest of my life.

14
Bill Bufalino is surprised to see his cousin, RUSSELL
BUFALINO, at the restaurant and headed for a table. Bill
Bufalino acknowledges his cousin with a kiss.
BILL
Frank, this is my cousin, Russell
Bufalino.
Frank recognizes Russell Bufalino as the man who helped
him with his truck.
FRANK
(to Russell)
Hey, didn’t you help me out with
my truck a couple of months ago?
BUFALINO
Yeah. It was nothing. It was that
timing chain. They’re tricky. Did
you get it fixed?
FRANK
Yeah. The next day. Thanks again.
BUFALINO
(teasing)
Watch yourself with these tough
guys around here. Alright, maybe I
see you around. (You did the right
thing.)
A smiling Russell shakes hands with Frank and walks alone
toward his own table as Bill and Frank are led to theirs.
FRANK
(to Bill)
Your cousin saved my ass. I could
have lost the whole load.
BILL
Yeah. He knows everything about
trucks. He worked for Canada Dry.
Frank looks over to where Russell is being seated.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - ANGELO BRUNO TABLE - CONTINUOUS
Frank sees Russell Bufalino being seated at Angelo
Bruno’s table. Skinny Razor is gone. Bruno rises as
Russell kisses Bruno’s cheek. Frank sees there are empty
tables on either side of the Bruno table despite the
restaurant being full with diners waiting.

15
FRANK V/O
I might not have known who Russell
Bufalino was back then, but I had
seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers to know he was
eating with Angelo Bruno, the new
boss of Philadelphia, who ran
everything from Philadelphia to
Atlantic City. That was all I had
to know that Russell Bufalino was
no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT
Dinner’s over. Russell has joined Bill, Frank and Skinny
Razor for coffee and anisette at Bill Bufalino’s table.
Bill and Skinny Razor are talking about Skinny ducking a
subpoena.
FRANK
(Italian, subtitled)
It’s very good bread. Thank you.
BUFALINO
(Italian, subtitled)
Where’d a Paddy learn to speak
Italian?
FRANK
(Italian, subtitled)
In Sicily. The war.
Russell is pleased and impressed with Frank’s Italian,
but even more so that he was in the war. They continue in
Italian (wherever italicized)Where?
Catania.

BUFALINO
FRANK

BUFALINO
I’m from Catania. How long?
FRANK
Four years. 411 combat days.
(in Italian)
122 at Anzio.
(back to English)
45th Infantry.

16
BUFALINO
It was bad there.
Frank nods, but doesn’t elaborate.
BUFALINO
Did you think you’d die?
FRANK
You think about it... you’re
scared... but once the action
starts, the fear goes away because
you’re too busy fighting... I made
it through the war so now, I look
around... I think... what happens,
happens.
Fuck it.

BUFALINO

Russell nods, leaves it at that.
FRANK
You got orders, you’d follow them.
They tell you take some prisoners
out to the woods - they don’t say
“what to do” - they’d just say...
like... “Hurry back”.
That’s war.

BUFALINO

EXT. ITALIAN FOREST - DAY - FLASHBACK
Frank holds a rifle on GERMAN SOLDIER #1 and #2 as they
dig holes in the forest floor.
FRANK V/O
You know it’s crazy but I never
understood how they would just
keep digging. Their own graves,
y’know? Maybe they thought if they
did a good job... the guy with the
gun...
German Soldiers #1 and #2 have finished digging and look
up plaintively at Frank for mercy.
FRANK V/O
... would change his mind.
Frank shoots the Germans. They fall into the hole.

17
BACK TO THE VILLA DI ROMA
To Frank and Russell BUFALINO
People cling to hope.
FRANK V/O
Russell took a shine to me. It
wasn’t long before he had me doing
little things for him and Angelo
Bruno, himself.
EXT. RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - 1975
The road ahead as the Lincoln drives a rural stretch of
I-80 West.
INT. FRANK’S LINCOLN - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Russell naps in the passenger seat while Frank drives,
their wives in back.
FRANK V/O
Carrie’s family went back to the
same town in Sicily as the
Bufalinos. They talked about it
all the time. She came from the
Sciandras. To them it was like
they came over on the Italian
Mayflower.
INT. BUFALINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1958 - FLASHBACK
Russell comes in late at night through the back door into
the darkened house. He’s surprised by Carrie who is still
up. He’s got blood splattered on his shirt and face,
which does not alarm her as it might most wives.
What happened?

CARRIE

Russell gives her a look.
CARRIE
Go get washed and give me the
shirt, I’ll put it in the wash.
He takes off the bloody shirt and hands it to her.

18
CARRIE
Don’t forget your shoes.
As Carrie goes off to wash his shirt, Russell bends down
to remove his bloodied shoes. He sets a gun down.
INT. FRANK’S LINCOLN - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Endless, boring trees, whiz by.
CARRIE
Can we stop, Frank?
EXT. RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - 1975
Frank pulls the car to the side of the highway. The women
get out to smoke. The car doors shutting wakes Russell.
Where are we?

BUFALINO

FRANK
Outside Lewisburg.
BUFALINO
I got some things to do in
Lewisburg. Wake me up when we get
there.
Russell closes his eyes to nap.
INT. PENN DRAPE & CURTAINS, PITTSTON, PA - DAY - 1957
A succession of guys in suits and ties sit in chairs in
the rear of Russell’s fabric shop quietly waiting their
turn. They do not speak or acknowledge each other as two
female clerks hustle around checking bolts of fabric for
curtains and drapes.
FRANK V/O
He had a piece of everything, but
mostly he ran his business out of
Penn Drape and Curtains. Who knew
what it all was? I’m sure the man
had partners. They always have
partners. Nobody keeps all the
money, but everybody listened to
Russ. And when you did something
for Russ, you did it yourself.
Like he said -

19
BUFALINO
I don’t need two roads coming back
to me.
INT. PARK SHERATON HOTEL - DAY - OCT. 25, 1957
Arthur Grasso’s barber shop. Four barbers, two
bootblacks, a manicurist, and three customers, one of
them with his head back, eyes closed, getting a shave.
The man’s bodyguard leafs through a magazine as he waits,
then sets it down, gets up, and We follow him out to the adjacent lobby of the hotel
where he walks past shops, presumably to buy something at
the kiosk up ahead, passing two other men coming the
other way without acknowledging them And we go back with these two as they walk past the same
shops to the barber shop. They go in, but we keep going
to the florist next door, settling on flower arrangements
as ten shots ring out in the barber shop FRANK V/O
When Anastasia got killed in the
barber shop, it was Russell who
calmed things down so they weren’t
killing each other before it could
all get straightened out.
INT. LINCOLN TOWNCAR - DAY - OCT. 25, 1957
Fingers raise the volume on the car radio.
EXT. PENN DRAPE & CURTAINS - DAY - OCTOBER 25, 1957
Russell, in shirtsleeves, calmly talking to the men
inside the car. We hear nothing over the loud car radio
music.
FRANK V/O
Still, you’d never know it by
looking at him. But all the roads
led back to Russ.
EXT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - PITTSTON - DAY - 1957
The same modest house the Bufalinos will still be in
twenty years from now.

20
EXT. SKINNY RAZOR’S HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY - 1957
Frank sits in an idling car, the tailpipe breathing
steam into the chilly air.
FRANK V/O
I was helping out Skinny and his
friends with collections.
Skinny comes down the steps of his house in a robe and
slippers.
FRANK V/O
That’s all Skinny did. Grill
steaks and collect money.
Skinny pokes his head in the passenger window.

Doesn’t

SKINNY
Where’s the money?
FRANK
He didn’t have it. He (said) SKINNY
Don’t tell me, let me guess.
His mother died and the funeral
set him back.
Yeah.

FRANK

SKINNY
His fuckin mother’s been dying
over and over for ten years.
Don’t leave.
Skinny scampers back into the house and reemerges a
moment later with a paper bag in his hand.
Don’t use it.

SKINNY
Just show it to

Skinny sets the bag on the passenger seat and trots back
to his house. Frank sees a gun in the bag and drives
off.
INT/EXT. FRANK’S CAR - PHILLY STREET - DAY - 1957
Frank in his parked car, watching a street corner.
DEADBEAT #1 come around it.

Sees

21
We stay in the car to watch Frank approach the guy on the
sidewalk, showing that he is holding a gun in the paper
bag.
FRANK V/O
In those days, you took along a
gun just to show a guy. Today,
they shoot you with it.
The guy is terrified by the mere sight of the gun in the
open bag. They both get into the car.
FRANK V/O
In those days, you wanted your
money tomorrow. These days, they
want it yesterday.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - LATER - DAY - 1957
Skinny regards the guy standing before him.
SKINNY

Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

DEADBEAT
I swear.
SKINNY

Here.
Here.

DEADBEAT
Tomorrow.

Skinny nods, Okay, go.
What.

But the guy doesn’t go.
SKINNY

DEADBEAT
How am I going to get home?
SKINNY
Take a fuckin bus, get out of
here.
The deadbeat leaves.

22
INT. FRANK & MARY’S HOUSE - EVENING - 1958
Frank comes in to find Mary cooking and his daughter
Peggy sulking.
FRANK
What’s the matter with her?
MARY
Nothing. She knocked over
something in the grocery store and
made a mess. The grocer yelled at
her and shoved her out.
He pushed her?

FRANK

Frank turns to Peggy.
He pushed you?

FRANK

Peggy nods.
FRANK
The grocery on the corner?
Peggy nods.
FRANK
(to Peggy, sweetly)
Come with me sweetheart. Show me.
MARY
Frank, it was an accident.
EXT. GROCERY STORE - EVENING - 1958
Frank leads Peggy to the corner store where the burly
GROCER is alone.
That him?

FRANK

Peggy nods.
FRANK
You go home, sweetheart. Tell your
mother I’ll be right there. Okay?
Okay?
He kisses her on the top of her head and sends her home.
He then turns toward the grocery store.

23
INT. GROCERY STORE - EVENING - 1958
The GROCER is alone whacking away at a leg of lamb with a
meat cleaver as Frank enters.
GROCER
Frank, I’m sorry, but your kid was
out of line. I only did what you
and your wife should have done at
home.
Frank pulls the Grocer clear over the counter and slams
him on the floor. Frank then takes aim for a second and
stomps on the guy’s hand with all his weight.
EXT. GROCERY STORE - CONTINUOUS
Peggy has not gone home and is peeking into the store
where she sees her father stomping up and down on the
screaming Grocer’s hand.
Terrified, Peggy turns and runs home as her father stomps
on the Grocer writhing on the ground.
INT. FRANK & MARY’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT - 1958
The family eats in silence.
father, afraid of him now.

Peggy steals glances at her

INT. MOTHER OF SORROWS CHURCH - DAY
Frank and Mary’s daughter, DOLORES, is being baptized.
Unlike the last time, there are a lot of attendees mobsters from Downtown including Russell, Carrie, Bill
Bufalino, his wife, Johnny the trucker, Skinny Razor and
other assorted blue collar truckers and part time hoods.
Peggy watches her father, all she sees is the image of
her father’s heel crushing a hand.
FRANK V/O
It was a beautiful occasion.
Everybody showed up.(more to come)
INT. MELROSE DINER - PHILLY - DAY - LATE FALL 1958
Frank sits at a table with a cup of coffee when Whispers
DiTullio sits down. Frank nods.

WHISPERS
You wanna pick up a quick ten
grand?
Whispers is true to his name speaking so softly Frank has
to lean over to hear.
FRANK V/O
This is not the Whispers they blew
up in that car around the same
time...
FLASHCUT to a car blowing up. Then back to the diner Whispers continuing to fill Frank in on the job.
FRANK V/O
This is the other Whispers. The
good one who knew how to make
money.
WHISPERS
It’s a great business.
INT. DAISY LINEN SUPPLY - DAY - 1958
A big industrial laundry service, but with a lot of idle
machines.
WHISPERS (OVERLAP)
We supply all the bed sheets,
towels, and linen to most of the
Atlantic City casinos and hotels.
We pick it up, wash it, iron it,
and deliver it. Until recently,
it’s been a license to print
money.
INT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DAY - 1958
This place looks a lot like the other place, only busy.
WHISPERS (OVERLAP)
Except there’s this fuckin’
laundry down in Delaware that’s
knocking us dead. They’re cutting
the price. They’re scaring our
drivers. They’re sucking up more
and more of our business. I’m a
little concerned.

25
INT. MELROSE DINER - CONTINUED - 1958
Frank leans in closer as Whisper talks.
FRANK V/O
Whenever anybody says they’re a
little concerned, they are very
concerned. When they say they’re
more than a little concerned,
they’re desperate.
WHISPERS
I’m more than a little concerned.
EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DAY - 1958
As workers haul laundry out to trucks with the name
Cadillac Linen Service painted on them INT. MELROSE DINER - CONTINUED - 1958
Whispers passes an envelope across the table.
WHISPERS
We’ve gotta put these fuckin guys
out of business somehow.
Yeah.

FRANK

Frank takes a quick look inside the envelope.
FRANK
This isn’t ten grand.
WHISPERS
I know. Don’t worry. You know I’m
good for it. I didn’t wanna go on
the street asking for that kind of
money and have anybody asking
questions.
Frank looks at him, not sure he can trust him to pay up.
WHISPERS
What’s the matter, Frank? Take it.
What am I gonna do stiff you for
the money. You think I’m nuts? I’m
looking to put these Delaware
bastards out of business and we’ll
all be good.

26
Frank finally puts the envelope in his pocket.
WHISPERS
And remember, please! This is
between us. Don’t mention nothing
to nobody, even Skinny. That’s
why I didn’t wanna borrow the ten
grand off the street.
INT. FRANK & MARY’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1958
Frank takes five hundred from the $2000 stack of bills in
the envelope and gives the rest to Mary, at the kitchen
table with their three girls.
FRANK
I hit on a ten-dollar daily
double.
She knows it isn’t true, but doesn’t care.
it isn’t true and does care.

Peggy knows

EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DELAWARE - DAY - 1958
Frank drives slowly past the front of the Cadillac Linen
Service building. Then around the side. Then around the
back. He notes a burglar alarm box.
EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DELAWARE - NIGHT
He sits in his parked car, having a look at the building
at night. He gets out and crosses past the trucks, peers
in one of the industrial windows at the washing and
pressing machines inside.
EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT - 1958
At his car, Frank takes out a red 5-gallon gasoline tank.
He unscrews his car’s gas cap and shoves a two foot
length of rubber hose into the tank. He sucks on the hose
for a few seconds and quickly spits out the taste of
gasoline before he shoves the hose into the red gasoline
tank. He puts the red tank in the trunk of his car where
there are two more red tanks and a box of dynamite.
INT. FRANK & MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
He puts on a dark jacket over his dark clothes and heads
for the door.

27
EXT. FRANK & MARY’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1958
As he comes out and walks toward his car, he sees Skinny
standing next to his own, and stops.
SKINNY
Angelo wants to see you.
Frank jumps in Skinny’s car.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - LATER - NIGHT - 1958
Skinny leads Frank into the restaurant. Empty except for
Angelo, Russell and Phil the bartender.
Phil closes the door as they walk in. The door snaps as
he locks it. He puts the closed sign up.
BRUNO
Sit down, Frank.
Frank sits.

Listens to a silence before -

BRUNO (CONT’D)
What’re you doing in Delaware?
Frank glances from Angelo Bruno - who’s studying him to Russell Bufalino - who isn’t - and wisely decides to
tell the truth.
FRANK
Bombing out a laundry service.
BRUNO
For who?
(nothing from Frank)
This is not one of those times to
not say.
For Whispers.

FRANK
The other Whispers.

BRUNO
You know who owns the Cadillac
Linen Service?
FRANK
Some Jews in the laundry business.
BRUNO
They own part of it. Somebody
else has an interest in that. You
know who?

28

No.
I do.
Who.

FRANK
BRUNO
FRANK

BRUNO
No. I do. I own the other part.
Not I know who owns the other
part.
FRANK
I didn’t know that.
BRUNO
Whispers didn’t tell you it was
the Jew mob?
FRANK
He said Jew washerwomen.
BRUNO
Jew washerwomen. What else he
say? I’ll bet he said keep it to
yourself. Don’t say nothin’ to
nobody Downtown.
Frank nods.

Listens to the amplified sounds.

FRANK
I didn’t check. I’m sorry, I
should’ve checked. You want me to
give him his money back?
BRUNO
He won’t need it. You can keep
it.
You sure?

FRANK

BRUNO
He won’t need it.
Thank you.

FRANK

BRUNO
Thank Russell. I wouldn’t have
wasted my time. I’d have let the
Jews have you.

Then -

29
FRANK
(to Russell)
Thank you.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - 1958
Whispers waits on the street.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
It’s best to use something brand
new. Right out of the box.
Otherwise, you don’t know where
it’s been. What somebody did with
it you don’t even know about.
Whispers sees Frank come around the corner and walk
toward him - a friend walking toward a friend - as if to
give him a tip on a race or football game.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
So I recommend something new right
out of the box.
Frank shoots him with a .32 and keeps walking.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
Frank is seated at a small table before a soundless
television set.
FRANK
Naturally, the next thing you want
to do is throw it away.
(ALT: ...get rid of it.)
EXT. SCHUYLKILL RIVER - NIGHT - 1958
Frank drives slowly across the empty bridge, slows down
and scales the gun into the river as effortlessly as a
frisbee.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
There’s a spot in the Schuylkill
River everybody uses. They ever
send divers down there, they’d be
able to arm a small country.

30
INT. FRANK & MARY’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1958
Frank sits at the kitchen table reading a newspaper.
Glances up at his daughter Peggy, then back down at the
paper with a WeeGee-like photo of a body on the sidewalk
surrounded by cops and passersby. Next to it is a full
face mugshot of Whispers.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
With Whispers, it broke the ice.
EXT. SCHUYLKILL RIVER - ANOTHER NIGHT - 1958
Frank pulls up, gets out, throws a gun in the river.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
It was like the army.
EXT. SCHUYLKILL RIVER - ANOTHER NIGHT - 1958
Frank throws another gun in the river.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
You followed orders.
EXT. SCHUYLKILL RIVER - ANOTHER NIGHT - 1958
Another gun hits the water, and this time we go
underwater with it as it sinks to the bottom, where
there’s an arsenal of discarded guns.
FRANK V/O
And when I handled things for
Russell it was never for money,
but as a show of respect. You ran
a little errand, you did a favor,
you got a little favor back if you
ever needed it.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1958
As Frank approaches Russell’s table, the two sitting with
Russell leap to their feet, nod at Frank and move away.
FRANK V/O
And you always hurried back.
IRENE, the waitress, smiles and affectionately touches
Frank’s shoulder as she clears the dishes.

31
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT - 1958
Frank walks down a rain-slicked Downtown street with the
Villa di Roma waitress - Irene - stepping on reflections
of lights and neon signs on the wet pavement.
FRANK V/O
No time is a good time to leave
your wife, but that’s when I left
mine.
They disappear into a cheap hotel.
EXT. MOTEL - LEWISBURG, PA. - DAY - JULY 28, 1975
Frank pulls the Lincoln into the lot of a roadside motel
set down next to the highway.
INT. MOTEL OFFICE - LEWISBURG, PA. - DAY - 1975
While their wives smoke outside, Frank and Russell
check in. Only instead of taking money from either of
them, the manager gives Russell an envelope of cash.
INT/EXT. LINCOLN - LEWISBURG, PA. - DAY - 1975
Russell and Frank drive along a street in Lewisburg.
Here it is.

BUFALINO

Frank pulls to the curb in front of a fur shop. Gets out,
leaving the motor running, goes inside. Comes back out a
moment later with an envelope of cash which he gives to
Russell who puts it in the glove compartment, shuts it.
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - LEWISBURG - DAY - 1975
Russell waits in the Lincoln, Frank comes out of the

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY - 1959
Russell and his wife Carrie, along with Frank and his
second wife, Irene, and his two older daughters, Peggy
and Maryanne - bowl.

32
Peggy - about 10 now - and even more uncomfortable with
him - keeps her distance.
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATER - DAY - 1959
Frank and Russell drink beers and watch the women and
children bowl.
BUFALINO
I think that kid’s a-scared of me.
FRANK
She’s a-scared of me, too. She’s
one of those sensitive kids. You
know.
BUFALINO
That’s not good, Frank. She
shouldn’t be a-scared of you. You
gotta be close with your
daughters, you know. You gotta be
close with your family. You’re
blessed to have them. I told you
Carrie and I, you know, we can’t
have kids, you know. So you’re
blessed.
Bufalino motions Peggy to join him and her father.
BUFALINO
Sweetheart, do you know why God
made the sky so high?
No.

PEGGY

BUFALINO
Because he didn’t want the birds
to bang their heads.
Peggy is expressionless.
BUFALINO
(still trying)
You want candy or something to
eat?
No.

PEGGY

Peggy goes back to bowling and starts laughing with
Maryanne.

33
BUFALINO
Maybe it’s okay that she’s ascared of me, but she shouldn’t be
a-scared of you. You’re her
father. You’ve got to keep an eye
on that.
You’re right.

FRANK

BUFALINO
It happens sometimes in a divorce.
The kids get nervous. They start
resenting you.
FRANK
I’m lucky the way Mary and Renie
get along. The kids move back and
forth with no problems.
BUFALINO
It can make all the difference,
when the parents ain’t at war.
Russell looks over and smiles and waves to Peggy, but she
looks away.
BUFALINO
You good with the union?
FRANK
You kidding? Best union in the
world.
BUFALINO
Well, a good friend of ours is
gonna need some help.
Yeah? Who?

FRANK

BUFALINO
I mean the top guy. He’s gonna
need some help.
FRANK
You mean Hoffa?
BUFALINO
He’s got people who are looking to
make trouble. Some bastards tried
to pipe him over a workman’s comp
case.

34
FRANK
I heard he beat the shit out of
them.
BUFALINO
Yeah, but he’s still gonna need
somebody he can trust.
EXT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1959
A thunderstorm throws rain down on Frank he hurries from
his car to the Villa di Roma.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT
Russell and Skinny Razor are lingering at one end of the
bar. Frank is sitting on his own at a table having a
glass of wine. Russell is checking his watch. The bar
phone rings.
Right on time.

BUFALINO

Skinny answers the phone.
SKINNY
(into the phone)
Skinny. (listening) How you doing?
Good. And the family? Yeah, we’re
all good. Knock wood. Oh yeah,
Angelo’s fine. He got a good
physical with the doctor last
week. He’s in the pink. Knock wood
again. Let me give McGee the
phone. You take care of yourself,
you hear.
Skinny hands the phone to Russell. But Russell doesn’t
talk into it he walks the phone over to Frank’s table and
sits down. He puts an envelope on the table.
BUFALINO
(into the phone)
I got that friend I told you
about. He’s sitting here with me.
He’s a good union man. I want him
to meet his president. See what
you think of him.
Russell hands Frank the phone.

35

Say hello.

BUFALINO

FRANK
(into the phone)
Hello?
HOFFA
Hi Frank. It’s Jimmy Hoffa.
The image of Frank and Russell at the table slows down.
FRANK V/O
Nowadays, young people don’t
know who Jimmy Hoffa was. Maybe
they know he disappeared, that’s
about it. But back then, there
wasn’t an American alive who
didn’t know who he was.
INT. TEAMSTER’S WXDC HEADQUARTERS

- OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Hoffa is behind a large desk wearing a low-cost black
suit with a white shirt and black tie.
HOFFA
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.
Glad to meet you, even over the
phone.
EXT. DETROIT - DAY - 1957 - FLASHBACK
Jimmy comes through a large crowd of workers eager to
shake his hand.
FRANK V/O
In the 50’s, he was as famous
as Elvis. In the 60’s, he was as
famous as the Beatles. Next to
the President he was the most
powerful man in the country.
INT. TEAMSTER RALLY - DETROIT - DAY - 1957 - FLASHBACK
Jimmy orating before the crowd of workers - televised.
HOFFA
If you got it, a truck brought it

Russell at the table returns to normal HOFFA
I heard you paint houses.
FRANK
I do my own carpentry too.
HOFFA
That’s what I wanted to hear. I
understand you’re a brother of
mine.

HOFFA
Our friend speaks very highly of
you.
Thank you.

FRANK

HOFFA
He’s not an easy man to please.
I do my best.

FRANK

BACK TO THE TEAMSTER RALLY
Hoffa speaking to the workers HOFFA
We are facing a struggle as never
before. The most important thing
the labor movement cannot do
without is solidarity. Big
business has been on the attack BACK TO THE VILLA DI ROMA
Frank still on the phone with Hoffa HOFFA
- they want to tear the union
apart.
(MORE)

37
HOFFA (CONT'D)
Big business is working with the
government to sow the seeds of
dissent at a time when we need
unity. We need solidarity more
than ever in our history. Not just
our history but the history of the
working man in America.
Yes.

FRANK

HOFFA
You want to be a part of this
fight?
Yes I do.

FRANK

HOFFA
You want to be a part of this
history?
Yes I do.

FRANK

HOFFA
Can you be in Chicago tomorrow?
Russell pushes the envelope on the table toward Frank.
FRANK V/O
For a minute there, I thought it
was Patton.
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY - 1959
Cars pull into a parking lot behind a building.
HOFFA V/O
Go to Chicago. Speak to Joey
Glimco at Local 777. You’ll be
working in Public Relations.
Frank and Joey Glimco climb out of one of the cars.
They, and several other men enter the back door of the
building INT. CHICAGO BATHHOUSE - 1959
Frank is seated with JOEY GLIMCO, head of the Chicago
taxicab drivers union.

38
They are seated on a white tile counter draped in towels.
Glimco is smoking a fat cigar in the steam-filled room.
JOEY
You’re only here because Jimmy’s
getting screwed. It’s the
Seafarers Union trying to sign up
the same non-union cab drivers we
are. Lesbians, a lot of them, for
some reason.
EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT - 1959
A woman cab driver walks into a diner.
JOEY (OVERLAP)
This is what we have to deal
with, how to get these drivers to
join us rather than Paul Hall’s
union. He’s bullshitting people
that he can get a better contract
than Jimmy.
Frank walks over to the woman’s cab, opens the door and
hot-wires it.
JOEY (OVERLAP)
You understand, you’re here
because nobody knows you or what
the fuck you’re doing.
EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NIGHT - 1959
Frank and the other Local 777 guys push stolen non-union
cabs into Lake Michigan while cops stand around watching.
JOEY (OVERLAP)
Jimmy has Daley’s cops’ okay on
this. They won’t help us push but
they’ll make sure nobody stops us.
JOEY
This is a lot of work.
FRANK
Have you thought about using
candy?
Joey just looks at him, not sure what he’s saying.

39
EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT - 1959
The trunk of a car opens revealing boxes of dynamite.
Joey and Frank carry the boxes to a back door of a cab
garage, held open by another man.
EXT. CAB GARAGE - NIGHT - 1959
The place is silent.

Full of taxi cabs.

Suddenly they start exploding EXT. GROCERY STORE - CHICAGO - NIGHT - 1959
Frank and Joey Glimco approach a fruit stand.
JOEY
One thing about Jimmy, never make
him wait. You have a meeting with
him, get there on time. Get there
early. I can’t stress this
enough. He goes by time.
Joey taps at some watermelons.
FRANK
We should get going then.
JOEY
The other thing about him is he
doesn’t drink. Imagine that? He’s
the head of all the truck drivers
in the world and don’t drink. He
won’t even let you drink around
him. He calls it idiot juice.
INT. EDGEWATER HOTEL SUITE - CHICAGO - LATER - NIGHT
As Joey carefully cuts a hole in a watermelon, Frank
checks his watch.
JOEY
The other thing about him - he
doesn’t like watermelon.
Joey pours a fifth of rum into the hole in the watermelon.

40
INT. EDGEWATER HOTEL SUITE - LATER - NIGHT
They sip from bottles of ginger ale - Joey, Frank and
Jimmy Hoffa - but only two of them are eating the slicedup spiked watermelon.
JOEY
(excited)
You shoulda seen them sink right in
the water. One after the other.
I’ll bet this morning, when they
went looking for their cabs, they
didn’t know what hit them.
HOFFA
Sinking the cabs. Great idea Joey.
JOEY
It wasn’t my idea. It was Frank.
Hoffa looks at Frank, impressed.
FRANK
It’s not complicated. You just push.
JOEY
He just took over the pier. They
did exactly what he said.
(gobbles up watermelon
slice)
I never seen a guy walk through a
crowd like he does and he doesn’t
touch a single person! I’m not
kidding. I swear. Guys who didn’t
even know him, never saw him
before in their lives, still got
out of his way. I’m telling you it
was like “the parting of the
waves” - like Moses!
Hoffa looks over at a clearly mortified Frank listening
to Glimco’s excessive praise.
HOFFA
(to Joey)
You need him to stay another
couple of days?
JOEY
Yeah. We still got some dribs and
drabs.
Glimco hands Frank a slice of rum-laced watermelon.

41
HOFFA
(curious)
You two sure like watermelon.
INT. EDGEWATER HOTEL LIVING ROOM SUITE - LATER - NIGHT
Joey has left. It’s just Jimmy and Frank now. Jimmy in
pajamas and slippers. (Frank, still fully clothed,
stands near a utility rolling cot.)
HOFFA
Everybody has to be united in the
same direction, or there’s not
progress for the worker, Frank.
You saw it firsthand. To me those
guys ain’t union. They’re like
Nazi collaborators. Operating
behind our lines. You were in the
war. You know what I mean.
I do.
Good!

FRANK
HOFFA

Jimmy gets up in his pajamas and goes into his bedroom
leaving the door open. Frank arranges the pillows on the
cot. He looks into the bedroom and sees that Hoffa is
already sound asleep. Frank stretches out on the cot but
he’s fully awake.
FRANK V/O
Back in the 1950’s, Jimmy was
already the president of the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. The most powerful union
man in the country. Still, he
didn’t make me stay in his suite
in Chicago because he liked me. He
made me stay with him because he
didn’t want me registering in my
name at the hotel. By staying with
him in the big suite, there was no
proof I was even in Chicago. It’s
all about secrets. Just like
Whispers, except for Whispers it
didn’t turn out so good.

EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY -

Jimmy and his wife Josephine, and Frank and Irene and
his still-growing family including infant Connie in a

After Chicago, Jimmy and I got
close. Our wives hit it off and

EXT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT - 1959
Jimmy sets a tray of ice cream sundaes on the table,
placing the first one in front of Peggy.
FRANK V/O
To Peg, Jimmy wasn’t like Russ, or
Skinny or even me. For one thing,
Jimmy didn’t have a nickname like
the “Razor” or “The Hunchback”.
Also, to her, he was helping
people make more money, live
better lives. He wasn’t stomping
on somebody’s hand.
Jimmy really does love ice cream, dipping his spoon into
his sundae and savoring its taste like fine wine.

43
INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - 1960
Peggy stands in front of a blackboard reading an essay
from a piece of paper. A banner above the blackboard
reads: “CAREER DAY”.
PEGGY
“If you have it, a truck brought
it to you.” This is what Mr.
Hoffa says, and it’s true. He’s
the president of the Teamsters
Union with over a million members.
They all support him because they
now have steady jobs, great pay
and a pension for when they
retire.
Frank sits in a chair off to the side at the head of the
class. It’s his turn at career day. Peggy and Frank are
both wearing gold and blue enamel “A Friend of Jimmy
Hoffa” buttons written across a miniature trailer truck.
FRANK V/O
The Teamster Pension Fund had
eight billion dollars in it and
Jimmy had complete authority over
every bit of it.

JAKE GOTTLIEB
One five is all I need for the

Hoffa waves at Bill.
HOFFA

Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.
Gottlieb remains seated beaming as Bill and Frank leave
the office.
INT. HOFFA'S OFFICE - ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS
Frank and Bill open a large ebony credenza with an
elaborate Chinese design. Bill opens the credenza to
reveal stacks of cash in neat bank banded units reading:
$10,000, $50,000, etc.
Bill rummages around the stacks until he piles twelve
stacks marked $100,000 into Frank’s arms.

Sign reads: “ALLEN DORFMAN INSURANCE.”
Allen Dorfman is seated wearing a “Friend of Hoffa” pin
in his lapel.

45
FRANK V/O
There was so much paperwork back
then that Jimmy had to use an
insurance company, run by his
friend, “Red” Dorfman’s son,
Allen, to process the loans.
A title appears:
Allen Dorfman, shot eight times in the head in a Chicago
parking lot, 1979.

loans and then tack on a tenpercent finder’s fee.
BUFALINO
I appreciate what he did. He’s
okay. You make sure you thank
Marteduzzo from me.
BILL
He’d be glad to hear that.
EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY - 1956-1960
Cranes building the casinos such as the Stardust, the
Dunes, the Sands etc. in BG.
FRANK V/O
Back then, because the money was
for gambling, a lot of snooty
banks wouldn’t lend casinos money
for construction. I’m serious. But
without the regular banks, it was
the Teamsters’ billion-dollar
pension fund that stepped in and
lent the money that built Las
Vegas.

no idea she had twenty-two percent
of a Florida land deal called “Sun
Valley”, some charter fishing
boats, and a ski lodge with its
own mountain.

Some parked cars. In the backseat of one sits a man
wearing sunglasses and a fedora - SAM “MOMO” GIANCANA.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
One of Jimmy’s clients was Sam
“Momo” Giancana, who was friends
with the Kennedys from back when
Jack’s father made his fortune
(alongside the Italians) as a
bootlegger during Prohibition. The
old timers worked with him. Momo Sinatra - they all partied with
the Kennedys. Momo and Kennedy
even had the same girlfriend.
Together. At the same time.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - CHICAGO - DAY
Some mob guys walk across the lawns of a graveyard,
jotting down the names on the tombstones.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
So it was easy for the Mob to help
Joe Kennedy get his son elected
president by making sure he won in
Illinois.

INT. POLLING PLACE - CHICAGO - DAY - 1960
The men from the graveyard sign the names from the
tombstones on voting registers, then get back in line to
do it again.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
In exchange, the new president was
going to get Castro out of Cuba so
our guys could get their casinos
and race tracks and shrimp boats
in Havana back.
TV NEWS IMAGES - ELECTION NIGHT & RESULTS
Kennedy vs Nixon. Election night shows tight race. The
next day, Nixon’s press secretary reads the concession
letter to Kennedy.
INT. ARMORY LOUNGE - DAY
Chicago boss, SAM “MOMO” GIANCANA, and New Jersey boss,
TONY “TONY PRO” PROVENZANO, are watching the Kennedy
election victory on television. Momo, Tony Pro, and the
roomful of hoods cheer and toast each other with the
Kennedy victory.
FRANK V/O
The Italians wanted Kennedy the
Irishman as President... and they
got him.
On TV, Jack Kennedy goes up to stage to make his victory
speech.
INT. HOFFA’S LAKE ORION HOUSE - DETROIT - DAY - 1960
Jimmy, Jo, and their kids James P., Barbara and adopted
son Chuckie - all in their late teens - watching Kennedy

around a stage in Hyannis Port for his victory speech.
HOFFA
Jeezuschrist! God damn Kennedys.

HOFFA
Why? They’re gonna have to learn.
We’re going to war.

me through.

BOBBY
Are you saying you don’t remember
doing any favors for Johnny Dio or
you don’t remember the
conversation?
HOFFA
I’m saying, to the best of my
recollection, I must recall on my
memory, I cannot remember.
BOBBY
Where did this twenty thousand
dollars come from?
HOFFA
From individuals.
BOBBY
Which individuals?
HOFFA
Offhand, that particular amount
of money I borrowed I don’t know
at this particular moment, but the
record of my loans, which I
requested, I have, and out of all
the moneys I loaned over this
period of time I went into these
ventures.
Everyone looks at each other to see if that made any
sense to them.

INT. VILLA DI ROMA - DAY - 1960
Russell enters and distributes JFK election materials to
some regulars. A “Kennedy For President” poster hangs on
the restaurant’s mirror.
FRANK V/O
Even Russ did his part getting
Kennedy elected, too.
INT. BUFALINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1960
Christmas Eve. Lights glow on a tree. Music on the hifi.
The Bufalinos, and Frank and Irene and the girls sit
around the Christmas tree, opening the gifts Russell has
given them - jewelry for Irene, clothes and toys for the
girls.
FRANK V/O
For guys like Russ, it couldn’t
have been better.

Thank you.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
So what’s the first thing Jack
Kennedy does to repay Chicago for
all their help?
TV IMAGE - 1961
Of John F. Kennedy being sworn in at his inauguration.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
He puts his crazy brother in
charge of the Justice Department.
And what’s the first thing
Bobby does? He goes after not
just Jimmy - which in a way you
could understand - Jimmy hated the
Kennedys so much he gave Nixon a
half a million in Teamster cash.
They were the only union to back
Nixon - but Bobby also goes after
Giancana and all the other guys
who put his brother in the White
House.

EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - MARCH 1961
Frank stands on the front lawn in his robe and slippers,
watching a repairman on a telephone pole down the street
working on the lines, phone company van parked below.
FRANK V/O
Everybody was sure everybody’s
phone was bugged. I mean you
couldn’t say any names on the
phone. Everybody was “your
friend” or “our friend,” whether
they were your friend or not.
Even when you talked about Bobby
Kennedy. He was “our friend”.
EXT./INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - 1961
CAMERA looks down from above as upon a chessboard where
Hoffa, Bill Bufalino and Frank inch their way across the
courthouse’s polished marble floor surrounded by a small
army of reporters, cameramen, and TV anchors waving
microphones. The press keep shouting questions at Hoffa
and his trio until they are finally rescued by burly
Court Officers who shove the press aside and drag Hoffa,
Frank and Bill through a courtroom door.
FRANK V/O
It really got much worse when
Bobby became Attorney General.
When he ran the McClellan
Committee he held lots of bullshit
hearings, but he couldn’t put
anybody in jail. Now, he was the
Attorney General and he could send
anybody to jail, and, no question
Jimmy was at the top of Bobby’s
hit list. He even set up a special
“Get Hoffa Squad” where he had his
own guys from the FBI and IRS
working around the clock. Their
only job was trying to put Jimmy
Hoffa in jail. I’m serious. That’s
all they did.
INT. HOFFA’S OFFICE - TEAMSTERS’ WXDC HQ - DAY - 1961
An agitated Jimmy listening on a phone behind his desk
stares angrily at six large, tough, teamster officials,
including Frank.

51
HOFFA
(slams phone)
I’m working with a room full of
fuckin’ idiots. You pricks! You
motherfuckers put Johnny
O’Rourke’s kid on as a “general
organizer” for thirty-six grand at
the same time you let him sell
insurance to his father’s locals.
Don’t you know I’m under the gun?
I’ve got that Kennedy cocksucker
sticking his nose up my ass and
you let this shit happen in
public. You dumb motherfuckers
trying to put me away?
Frank turns and leaves the office.
HOFFA
Tell me now so I can kill you
worthless fucks right here.
FRANK V/O
I could see it was getting to him.
He was acting crazy. He was not
the same Jimmy. He was vicious. It
was really hard just being around
him.
Hoffa sees Frank leave. Stops.
INT. HOFFA’S OFFICE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Jimmy catches up with Frank.
HOFFA

FRANK
I quit. You ain’t calling me a

HOFFA

FRANK
Then let me know that. They wanna
take what you’re saying-- they can
take it. Not me.
HOFFA
But I said it don’t apply to you.

FRANK
You got a problem pull me aside.
Don’t insult me and then say it
don’t apply to me.
HOFFA
(walks Frank back toward
office)
Okay. Okay. Come on. You know me
better that.
FRANK V/O
In the end, I had to stick by him.
I knew the bullshit he was going
through.

Frank and Russell alone at a table, floating three coffee
beans in their after-dinner Sambuca shots.
FRANK
Russ, I don’t know how Jimmy’s
running the union with Bobby and
the FBI up his ass all the time.
He’s going crazy.
BUFALINO
Tell Jimmy I’m sorry for his
troubles, but if worse comes to
worst, the old timers know the
father. They talk... and they
could straighten things out.
FRANK
But he can’t understand why you
guys helped the Kennedy pricks get
elected in the first place. It
don’t make sense to him.
BUFALINO
Jimmy don’t have to know
everything. You understand?
Sometimes it’s better.
Yeah.

He’s too emotional. He gets caught
up in bullshit like some guy being

BUFALINO
They had a word with the old man.
And he had a word with his son,

who he fuckin owes.
EXT. PHILLY - DAY - 1961
Frank pulls into a South Philly trucking company lot,
climbs out of his car and speaks to a guy.
BUFALINO (OVERLAP)
So, I want you to go see Phil at
Milestone Hauling. He’s gonna
have a rig for you.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY - 1961

EXT. CONCRETE PLANT - BALTIMORE - DAY - 1961
Frank pulls the rig onto the grounds of the plant.
There’s a little landing strip next to it.
BUFALINO (OVERLAP)
A guy will meet you there. A
fairy named Ferrie.
Dave Ferrie, whose alopecia has him wearing a homemade
reddish wig, drawn eyebrows and makeup, directs Frank to
back his rig up to where some army trucks are parked.

BUFALINO (OVERLAP)
You’ll pick up some things and
he’ll give you some paperwork for

Frank watches some Maryland National Guardsmen transfer
weapons, ammo, and uniforms from their trucks to his.

Frank drives the rig down Route 13.

A deserted greyhound race track. Stuffed rabbit on a

BUFALINO (OVERLAP)
A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there and give you a
car to get you back to Philly.
As the guy gives Frank the keys to a car, Frank regards
his ears. They don’t look so big.
BIG EARS
What are you looking at?
looking at my ears?

You

FRANK
I ain’t looking at your ears.
BIG EARS
I had an operation, so there’s no
need for anyone looking at my ears

FRANK
I ain’t looking at your ears.
Big Ears walks away. Frank climbs into the car and
watches as a bunch of Cubans begin unloading the weapons
and ammo from the truck he just drove down.

Castro fulminates making an anti-American speech on TV.
INT. HOFFA’S OFFICE - TEAMSTERS’ WXDC HQ - DAY APRIL 1961
A furious Hoffa in his office with Bill Bufalino. Hoffa
is going through a stack of subpoenas.
HOFFA
Just like I predicted. Right after
they fuck up Cuba, Boobie starts
coming after me and the union.
He’s looking for some cheap
publicity. That’s what he’s doing.
BILL
It’ll blow over, Jimmy.
HOFFA
(annoyed)
What’s the matter with you? It’ll
never blow over. You think they’re
ever gonna forget the money I gave
Nixon? Never!
Hoffa sweeps the subpoenas off his desk.
BILL
Jimmy, please, calm down. Some of
the old timers are trying to reach
the old man Kennedy now. He’s
supposed to be sick, but...

56
HOFFA
(interrupts)
Are you nuts? The old man ain’t
“sick”. He just had a stroke. He’s
useless. He turned into an
eggplant.

Oh shit! You can’t blame anybody
for that.

I can! I blame his kids. The two

Nothing, Jimmy. I don’t mean it as

Yeah? Tell me.

Sure, the guy’s loyal. He’s even a
nice guy, but he’s not too sharp.
You know, he plays a lot of golf.
HOFFA
But that’s who you want for a

but somebody you can have walking

Maybe you’re right, Jimmy. That
makes sense.

Guys like that give unions a bad
name. Something’s got to be done.
FRANK
Him being him, that could be
tough.
HOFFA
No. No. I don’t want that. I mean
getting working guys who know the
union, card-carrying teamsters
like you and me, to start running
to take over some of the locals.
FRANK
He’s not going to like that.
HOFFA
So what? I’m the president. I run
the union. All I need is some guys
who know their way around and know
how to handle themselves. That’s
all.
(Hoffa claps Frank’s
shoulder)
That’s why I want you to run for
president of Local 326.
Frank is stunned by Jimmy’s belief in him.
HOFFA
You’re like family to me, Frank.
You, Irene, the girls. Lovely
Peggy. But that’s not why I’m

The owner, surprised, puts the envelope back in the desk

With the jury out of the room, attorney Bill Bufalino the same Teamster attorney who represented Frank in his
trucking theft case - appeals to Judge William Miller to
have a case thrown out - this one against Hoffa.
BILL
Your Honor, Mr. Hoffa was
advised by counsel that it was
perfectly legal for his wife to be
part owner of a trucking business.
Still, when the McClellan
Committee challenged its legality,
she immediately withdrew from the
company.
Among the spectators, and there aren’t that many beyond
some print journalists, is a young man in a raincoat.

This should have been the end
of the matter. There has been no
indictment secured against my
client in thirteen grand juries.
The nut in the raincoat walks down the aisle toward the
defense and prosecution tables -

Your Honor, this is an example of
a personal vendetta against my
client and his family by a
frustrated Justice Department and
Attorney General, Robert Kennedy The nut pushes open the gate, pulls out a gun, points it
at Jimmy, who rushes him, grabs him. The gun - a pellet
gun - goes off and everyone scrambles for cover as Jimmy
wrestles the guy to the floor.
Jimmy’s adopted son/bodyguard, Chuckie O’Brien - who
looks Italian because he is - jumps over the railing and
beats the guy in the head until the marshals get there
and take over. Jimmy is thrilled with Chuckie HOFFA

The Caddie driver who rendezvoused with the trooper out
on the highway, EWING KING, is called to the stand. As
he raises his right hand and is sworn in, Jimmy, at the

fingers. The man nods almost imperceptibly as he sits in
the box.

He gets up to see what’s going on. The attorneys and

Frank and Bill Bufalino just watch.
TV IMAGES - NOV. 25, 1963
The slain president’s solemn funeral procession that
Jimmy isn’t part of.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy was right. Almost. After the
assassination, Bobby’s own
vendetta against everybody
stopped.
INT. COURTROOM - NASHVILLE - DAY - 1964
Jimmy stands before the judge and jury. Frank watches
from his usual spot behind Jimmy in the gallery.
FRANK V/O
But the prosecutors just kept
coming. A year after Dallas, while
Bobby was running for the New York
Senate, the government still
brought a jury tampering and fraud
case against him.
JUDGE
Mr. Hoffa, most defendants who
stand before this court for
sentencing have either violated
the property rights or personal
rights of other individuals.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
You stand here convicted of having
tampered with the very soul of
this nation.
INT. PROSECUTOR NEAL’S OFFICE - DAY
Hoffa’s prosecutor Jim Neal, reporters, the Judge, FBI
agents, and Ed Partin, the teamster who wore the wire
against Hoffa, are all celebrating their victory at
Hoffa’s conviction in Neal’s tiny office.
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - 1967
A prison bus roars past on Highway 15.
EXT. LEWISBURG FEDERAL PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1967
The black bus pulls past the gates of the penitentiary.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1967
Jimmy Hoffa - Inmate No. 33298-NE - is fingerprinted
and photographed and given a blue denim prison uniform.
INT. SILVER SHOP - PITTSBURGH, PA - DAY - 1975
As a shopgirl wraps the sterling silver gifts Irene and
Carrie have chosen in silver wedding paper, Russell talks
with the store owner with Frank at his side BUFALINO
You know, everybody likes to shop
in your store but your son is
“s’feigatta.” He’s acting wild.
You can't control him, you know,
there’s nobody's going to want to
come into your shop anymore. And
that’s not good for you and it’s
not good for me, it’s not good for
anybody. You gotta, you gotta,
take control of this kid.
INT. VISITORS ROOM - LEWISBURG - DAY - 1967
A glass partition separates Jimmy from his lawyer Bill
Bufalino and his pension fund lawyer, ALLEN DORFMAN.
They’re on the visitor phones.

70
FRANK V/O
Jimmy set it all up. Fitz was
running things alright, but that
was for show. Fitz got his orders
from Jimmy through Bill and Allen
Dorfman who ran Jimmy’s loans.
Where is he?

HOFFA
He’s late.

Bill and Dorfman look at the ceiling. Finally Frank
“Fitz” Fitzsimmons comes in and sits down next to Bill
and Dorfman, taking a phone.
FITZ
Sorry I’m late. We’ve got a lot
going on.
FRANK V/O
Fitz’s main qualification was
he was weak. Jimmy could control
him. He liked to drink and play
golf and that was about it.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY - 1966
Fitzsimmons whacks a golf ball off a tee. The other
golfers in his group are mobsters, including Tony Pro.
FRANK V/O
As much as Jimmy was getting
pissed at Fitz, everybody else
liked him, cause they got things
out of Fitz they could never get
out of Jimmy. It’s what happens
when you go away.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1967
Russell at dinner with Frank.
BUFALINO
We like Fitz, but Jimmy’s got that
ball busting Dorfman holding up
loans that Fitzie already okayed.
And that Dorfman’s one tough Jew.
Which Frank takes as his order to get rid of Dorfman. He
nods, he’ll take care of it.
So... uh...

FRANK

71
BUFALINO
No. No. Just put a firecracker up
Dorfman’s ass. That’s all. Fitz
will get the message. If you did
it to Fitz, that lush would run to
the Feds and screw everything up.
EXT. ALLEN DORFMAN’S HOUSE - CHICAGO - DAY - 1967
A garage door opens automatically.
Cadillac backs out.

Allen Dorfman’s

The windows of the Caddie suddenly explode from shotgun
blasts. Holes erupt in the body of the car.
Dorfman yanks the glove compartment open to get to his
gun as the shotgun blasts keep pocking the car.
Tires screech and then it’s silent. Dorfman pokes his
head up to see a Lincoln driving off, not quite believing
he’s not dead.
EXT. WRECKING YARD - DAY - 1967
The Cadillac is destroyed. Dorfman is fine and doesn’t
even look that concerned anymore, though Fitz does as he
nervously regards the shot-up car.
FRANK V/O
Fitz got the message. He was
terrified. After that, anybody
who wanted anything from the
Pension Fund got it.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1967
Jimmy sitting at a table by himself. A kitchen inmate
makes a special ice cream sundae. Jimmy turns to look
around.
FRANK V/O
But in Lewisburg, Jimmy had the
other thing to be concerned about:
The Little Guy.

72
EXT. PRO’S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY - 1966
As Tony Pro relaxes by the pool of his Miami house in
shorts and unbuttoned linen shirt, a drink and a cigar,
playing Greek rummy with some guys amidst statuary of
wild animals and cherubs and nudes, some FBI agents
approach with their badges out.
FRANK V/O
They got Pro for extortion and
gave him seven years. And by now
things had got tense between him
and Jimmy.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1967
The kitchen inmate delivers the ice cream sundae to Jimmy
at his table.
HOFFA
This is a work of art, Pete.
Thank you.
The kitchen inmate leaves to let him enjoy it. Jimmy
takes a bite, savoring the ice cream. But then, spoiling
the moment, Pro sits at the table with his tray of food,
in a prison uniform now instead of pool attire.
PRO
I got to talk to you about a
problem I got with my pension.
HOFFA

I know.
You know?

PRO
What do you know?

HOFFA
I know it’s a million-two and
there’s a problem with it.
PRO
So you’ll look into it for me.
HOFFA
There’s nothing to look into.
It’s what it is.
What is it?

PRO

73
HOFFA
You lost it. You forfeited it
when you came here.
PRO
Yours is forfeited, too?
No.

HOFFA

Pro can’t imagine why his pension is gone and Jimmy’s
isn’t, but Jimmy doesn’t elaborate, just eats his ice
cream. Eventually PRO
Yours is still there. Your
million-five or whatever it is.
Uh-huh.

HOFFA

PRO
We’re both sitting here.
HOFFA
We’re both sitting here for
different things. You’re sitting
here for extortion. I’m sitting
here for fraud.
So?

PRO

HOFFA
So that’s the difference.
PRO
What’s the difference.
HOFFA
I didn’t threaten anybody, you
did.
So what?

PRO
That makes no sense.

HOFFA
It does if you think about it.
PRO
It doesn’t, but I don’t want to
debate. Just do something about
it.

74
HOFFA
There’s nothing I can do.
PRO
There’s always something you can
do.
HOFFA
It’s Federal law.
PRO
I don’t care. You can still do
something about it.
I can’t.

HOFFA
What can I do.

PRO
You can get me my fuckin money.
How?

HOFFA

PRO
Some other way.
What way.

HOFFA

PRO
The same way you got your money.
HOFFA
I earned my money.
PRO
You’re here for fraud. You stole
money. I stole money. Okay, in a
different way. Fine. Still. I
want what I’m owed.
You people.
What?
What?

HOFFA
PRO
HOFFA

PRO
What did you say?

75
HOFFA
I can’t help you.
PRO
You people, you said. What does
that mean, you people.
HOFFA
I’m done talking about this.
You people?

PRO

Jimmy ignores him. Eats his ice cream like Pro’s not
there. Suddenly Pro lunges across the table, and grabs
him. They tumble to the floor and fight until the guards
get there to break it up.
INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - 1967
As LBJ looks on, Ramsey Clark raises his right hand to be
sworn in as Attorney General.
FRANK V/O
With Bobby gone, Ramsey Clark got
upped to Attorney General.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1967
Frank, Skinny, Russell and the rest of the regulars are
watching Ramsey Clark questioned by a Senator on the bar
TV.
RAMSEY CLARK
Public safety will not be found in
wiretapping. Security is to be
found in excellence in law
enforcement, in courts and in
corrections - not wiretapping.
Nothing so mocks privacy as the
wiretap and electronic
surveillance. They are
incompatible with a free society.
SENATOR
So in your judgment, the enactment
of this bill will in no way affect
your department’s war on organized
crime?
RAMSEY CLARK
That’s correct.

76
Cheers erupt, glasses are lifted, the mobsters shouting
‘To Pamsey,’ and, ‘We love you, Pamsey.’
BUFALINO
You know what this means. We can
speak English on the phone again.
EXT. RURAL OHIO - DAY - 1975
The Lincoln flies past a highway sign: Columbus 64,
Dayton 86, Detroit 272.
EXT. GAS STATION - RURAL OHIO - DAY - 1975
Russell in a phone booth talking to someone. Frank
paying an attendant for gas and getting a receipt,
glancing over there. The wives off smoking by the
highway of this gas station with nothing else around it.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1972
Frank and Russell at Russell’s usual table.
BUFALINO
That crazy bastard thinks he can
do that right there in Columbus
Circle in front of 5,000 people
and get away with it? That’s not
right. You hear me Frankie?
FRANK V/O
He was right. Who else runs around
with show business people like
he’s Errol Flynn, getting his
picture in the papers, drawing
attention to everybody.
INT. SENATE CHAMBERS - DAY - 1958 FLASHBACK
Unlike every other organized crime figure the McClellan
Committee has dragged in, Joe Gallo has gone out of his
way to look the part - black shirt, slicked-back hair,
dark glasses, pinky ring, smoking a cigarette - playing
to the news cameras during his testimony.
FRANK V/O
He was known downtown as “Joey the
Blonde”, but everybody, especially
the newspapers, called him “Crazy
Joe”.

77
SENATOR
Mr. Gallo, do you have an opening
statement?
GALLO
(looking down at the
carpeting)
Yeah. This rug would be great for
a crap game.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
Frank sitting where we left him.
FRANK
Right then, you knew it was all
gonna fall apart.
EXT. THE COPA - NIGHT - 1972
Crazy Joe gets out of a car with his new young wife,
actor friends, and bodyguard Pete the Greek. Flashbulbs
pop. He signs a couple of autographs. He jokes with those
on line as he and his entourage enter swept in by Copa
doormen.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
He went against everything and he
didn’t give a damn. Growing up, he
kidnapped his own bosses. I don’t
even know how he lived after that.
When he went away he recruited
black guys instead of his own
kind, and when he got out, nobody
knew what he was doing or who he
was doing it with.
EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - DAY - FLASHBACK - 1971
An Italian-American Unity Day rally. 5,000 people.
Italian flags, American flags. Italian-American Civil
Rights League signs and buttons.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
You don’t like what he’s doing?
Say something...
As Joe Colombo gets up to speak at the podium, a black
man walks up and shoots him in front of his family, and
is in turn shot by Colombo’s men.

78
FRANK (IN SYNC)
... and see what happens.
INT. THE COPA - NIGHT - 1972
An Italian-American Civil Rights League pin with a
diamond in it, worn by Russell, who’s with Frank at a
table. DON RICKLES is in the middle of a set.
BUFALINO
Who does that? I tell you who does
that. Nobody. Like him and Oswald,
that’s it. And even in Dallas it
was just Jackie there, not the
kids.
DON RICKLES
...That’s how I get hired. I work
everybody. I work Jews. I work
Blacks. I work Gypsies. I work
Italians.
(seeing Gallo)
Uh oh!
(points)
Not those Italians.
(waves)
Hiya! Joey! Hiya! Cent’anni!
L’Chaim! Au Salud!
(aside to crowd)
I was told to be very careful of
what I said.
Gallo feigns anger and grabs a champagne bottle from a
bucket and pretends to throw it.
DON RICKLES
(hands in prayer)
No! Please. It’s okay, Joey, I got
the money. Don’t shoot me. Madonna
Mia. Maaa! Maaaaa!
Gallo laughs and puts the bottle back.
DON RICKLES
(waves shyly)
Happy birthday, Joey.
INT. THE COPA - LATER - NIGHT - 1972
The show’s over. Gallo walks past Russell’s table. Frank
is standing by Russell. Gallo nods respectfully. Russell
raises a glass.

79
GALLO
Hey Russ,
(taps Russell’s pin)
What’re you doing with that? You
really believe in that bullshit
league?
FRANK
Joey, that’s nothing to talk about
here.
GALLO

What?
He’s a boss.

FRANK

GALLO
(laughs)
So he’s a boss. So am I a boss.
We’re all supposed to be brothers.
FRANK
Joey, let’s not have a beef.
Gallo walks off.

Russell looks at Frank looking at Joey.

INT. A ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT - 1972
Various calibers of pistols laid out on a bed.
FRANK V/O
For something like this you want
two guns: The one you intend to
use, and a backup.
Frank regards the guns while the man who gathered them red-haired John Francis - waits.
FRANK V/O
You want something with more
stopping power than a .22.
(moves the .22s aside)
You certainly don’t want a
silencer. You want noise to send
the witnesses running so they’re
not looking at you.
(moves the silencers
aside)
But not the noise a .45 makes
that you could hear in a patrol
car blocks away.
(moves the .45s aside)
(MORE)

80
FRANK V/O (CONT'D)
The cops call a .32 a woman’s gun
because it’s easier to handle and
doesn’t do the damage a .38 does,
but it does enough.
He picks up a .32 and a .38.
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT - APRIL 7, 1972
Little Italy on a mid-evening Spring night.
FRANK V/O
It would be late so the tourists
from Idaho would be in bed. And
being in Little Italy would relax
him.
We - our POV - find and enter Umberto’s Clam House INT. UMBERTO’S CLAM HOUSE - NIGHT - 1972
The POV regards the interior - the two entrances on
Mulberry and Hester - the arrangement of tables - like
making a mental diagram of the place.
FRANK V/O
It was his birthday, so he’d be
there with his wife and kid, which
in this case, is the point. They
should have to see what it’s like.
A waiter comes past with plates of spaghetti with clam
sauce.
FRANK V/O
He’d have some champagne in him,
which would slow him down a
little.
The POV finds the only empty table, a reserved card on
it.
FRANK V/O
His bodyguard would be with him,
and he himself might be carrying
too, but it’d probably be in the
wife’s purse.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT - 1972
John Francis’s car, heading into Manhattan.

81
FRANK V/O
You never got a lot of advance
notice. And all you knew was your
part of it, since three people can
keep a secret only if two of them
are dead.
INT. JOHN FRANCIS’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT - 1972
Frank and John Francis, not talking as John drives.
FRANK V/O
John the Redhead only knew he
was going to drop me off, circle
the block, and pick me up.
EXT. LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT - 1972
It’s 4:00 am. Umberto’s Clam House is the only place
open this late. Crazy Joey’s Lincoln pulls up in front.
He climbs out with his wife Sina, her 12-year-old
daughter Lisa, his sister, and his bodyguard.
FRANK V/O
You want to take out the bodyguard first. Not kill him, just
disable him. You got no argument
with him, so not in the face or
chest.
The Gallos and the bodyguard disappear into Umberto’s.
FRANK V/O
Sometimes with something like
this you want to go to the
bathroom first.
John Francis pulls the car to the curb a block away.
Frank gets out and the car pulls away.
FRANK V/O
It gives you a chance to make
sure nobody followed you in. It
also gives you a chance to make
sure nobody’s in the bathroom you
have to worry about.
Frank walks toward Umberto’s Clam House.

82
FRANK V/O
It also gives you a chance to go
to the bathroom. You don’t want
to be uncomfortable.
Frank opens the Mulberry Street door of Umberto’s FRANK V/O
But I went before and in a place
this small, this late, you may as
well just get to work.
INT/EXT. UMBERTO’S CLAM HOUSE - NIGHT - 1972
Frank steps inside. Notes the bodyguard at one table,
and Gallo, his wife and sister and the little girl at
another.
Frank walks toward the tables and shoots Pete the Greek
in the thigh with the .38. Gallo’s wife and sister dive
for cover, pulling the girl down with them.
Gallo pushes away from the table. Frank fires, hitting
him in the elbow. As he runs for the door, Frank shoots
him in the back. He collapses on the sidewalk and Frank
puts two more in him, then walks up the block just as
John Francis pulls around it. He gets in the car.
EXT. YONKERS - LATER - DAWN - 1972
Frank throws the .38 into the Hudson while John Francis
waits in the car.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1972
A TV report on the hit at Umberto’s.

Neither says anything about the news report or anything
else. She just leaves.

Frank washes his hands in the men’s room.

Comes out and

83
He can’t be sure but it seems Russell maybe stops talking
to whoever he’s talking to until Frank is out of earshot.
He joins Irene and Carrie at a table.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1972
Jimmy is escorted down the cell block by guards.
FRANK V/O
What can I say. The guy organized
a prison. Give him six more months
in there and he would have got
them a pension plan.
EXT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY - 1972
Jimmy’s lawyer, Bill Bufalino, stands with his client
before reporters and photographers as he’s released from
prison.
HOFFA
The first thing I’m going to do is
register with the Federal
Probation Office, as I’m required
to do. Then I’m going down to
Florida with my wife to get some
sun.
REPORTER
Any plans after that?
HOFFA
Yeah. Take back control of my
union.
EXT. LUMS - MIAMI - DAY - 1972
Frank waits at the pick-up counter of a hotdog place.
A TV by the grill - like every TV in America - reports on
the arrest of burglars at the Watergate.
FRANK V/O
And the first thing I did was
pick us up some chili dogs from
Lums, which Jimmy loved almost as
much as ice cream.
Frank watches as his order is being cooked.

84
FRANK V/O
The secret is they steam them in
beer. There’s not a better hotdog
in America.
INT. JIMMY’S CONDO - MIAMI - DAY - 1972
The Watergate break-in report on the TV here, too, as
Frank and Jimmy eat their chili dogs. But Jimmy’s less
interested in that than the current Teamsters newsletter
he’s reading. Jo, just in from the pool, is making
herself some lunch.
HOFFA
What am I going to do with Fitz.
He tosses the newsletter to Frank.
Fitzsimmons accepting some award.

A cover photo shows

HOFFA (CONT’D)
He actually thinks he runs things?
I appointed him! He didn’t win
any election! Now he thinks he’s
somebody? Accepting fuckin
awards?
Jo comes over with her lunch to join them.
FRANK
He’s very popular with certain
people.
HOFFA
Of course he is! He loans money
to every goombah who asks. If the
banks did that - can you imagine? we’d have a financial crisis.
FRANK
It don’t matter. You run against
Fitz and you win hands down.
JO
You’ve got the Southwest and
Central locals locked up. All you
need is enough votes in the
Northeast and you can win it all.
FRANK
(to Jo, offering her a
chili dog as Hoffa
continues to talk)
Sure you don’t want one?

85

No. No thanks.

JO

HOFFA
Yeah, I just can’t believe I’ve
got to go to that prick Tony Pro
to get them.
Frank nods, but his silence says something.
What.

HOFFA

FRANK
Like I said, Fitz is popular.
HOFFA
Wiseguys don’t run this union!
FRANK
With Fitz, they do.
JO
But once you’re back as President
you can fire anybody, right? You
can even fire Tony Pro.
That’s right.

HOFFA

JO
You can even watch him clean out
his desk so he doesn’t steal the
pencils.
HOFFA
(to Frank)
See that. Everybody thinks she’s
the nice one and that I’m the bad
guy.
(kisses her cheek)
It’s just the opposite. I’m the
nice guy and she’s the killer. I
hate I gotta deal with that
cocksucker - he’s fucked
everything up.
FLASHCUT TO
Tony Pro attacking Jimmy over the ice cream in the prison
cafeteria And right back here, to the CONDO -

86
HOFFA
I know that cocksucker is
campaigning for Fitz on the sly.
FRANK
It’s because of his pension.
HOFFA
Because of the pension he doesn’t
deserve.
FRANK
He still got a lot of votes over
there.
HOFFA
Because of me! I gave him that
power! Now I got to make peace
with the cocksucker? I gotta ask
him to endorse me? I hate the
idea of that.
FRANK
Without Pro’s locals, Fitz loses.
JO
There’s no doubt about that.
Jimmy tries to picture sitting down with Pro, and it’s
enough to ruin his otherwise nice Lum’s lunch.
HOFFA
If I sat down with him, would
you come along?
Of course.

FRANK

INT. PRIVATE CLUB - MIAMI - DAY - 1972
Frank and Jimmy wait at a table for Tony Pro to show up.
Jimmy checks his watch. Looks at Frank.
Fuck it.

HOFFA
Let’s go.

FRANK
Let’s give him a few more minutes.
HOFFA
This isn’t right. You don’t do
this. You don’t make a man wait.

I know.

HOFFA
The only time you do is when?
When you want to say something.
When you want to say, Fuck you.
That’s the only time.
Frank nods.

They wait, Jimmy getting madder by the

Finally, a white Cadillac pulls up out front and Pro,
wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt, comes in with
his cousin-in-law ‘Tony Jack’ Giacalone, who, unlike Pro,
is wearing enough clothes to conceal a piece, and join
Jimmy and Frank at the table.
PRO
Can you believe this weather?
People are freezing to death in
New York and look at us. It’s 80
outside. It’s perfect. Why we
don’t live here year-round is what
I want to know.
It’s summer.
What?

HOFFA
PRO

HOFFA
It’s summer. People aren’t
freezing to death in New York.
PRO
In my mind it’s always 8 degrees
in New York. I’m making a point.
Jimmy regards Pro’s casual attire and his tan.
HOFFA
This is how you dress for a
meeting?
PRO
(re: Hoffa’s clothes)
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?
HOFFA
For a meeting, if it’s Florida or
Timbuktu. And you’re late.

88
PRO

What?
You’re late.

HOFFA

PRO
There was traffic.
HOFFA
I’ve never been late for a meeting
in my life.
PRO
(to his cousin-in-law)
Wasn’t there traffic?
There was.

TONY JACK

HOFFA
I’ve never waited for anybody
who’s late more than ten minutes.
PRO
I’d say fifteen. Fifteen is
right.
No.

Ten.

HOFFA

PRO
I don’t think so. Ten is not
enough. You have to take traffic
into account.
HOFFA
That is taking traffic into
account. That’s why it’s ten.
PRO
I still say fifteen.
Ten.
Fine.

HOFFA
PRO
We disagree on that.

HOFFA
More than ten is saying something.
Are you saying something to me.

89
PRO
I’m here. That says what it says.
What can I do for you?
Jimmy can barely think straight as mad as he is about Pro
being late, but eventually collects himself.
HOFFA
I want to ask you for your
endorsement (for) PRO
Wait, before you tell me, let’s
get the other thing straightened
out.
HOFFA
I can’t do anything about your
pension. Not with Fitz in there.
With Fitz there, you should talk
to Fitz about it.
PRO
I did. He says he’ll take care of
it. No questions asked. You
wouldn’t do that, but he will. I
meant the other thing.
HOFFA
The other thing.
PRO

You know.
I don’t know.
Your apology.
My apology.

HOFFA
PRO

HOFFA
For what.

PRO
For what you said when you were
sitting there eating your fucking
ice cream like some fucking king.
That was an ethnic slur - “you
people.”
Jimmy just looks at him.

Then -

90
HOFFA
I’ll apologize for that - after
you apologize for being late - you
mother fucking wop cocksucker.
Now Pro just looks at Jimmy while Frank shakes his head
wearily. Eventually PRO
I’ll apologize for being late after I kidnap your granddaughter,
rip her guts out and send them to
you in a fuckin envelope.
Jimmy goes for him. Frank and Tony Jack try to pull them
apart - like the guards did in the prison cafeteria but, just like then, it isn’t easy.
INT. CAR - MOVING - MIAMI - DAY
Frank drives Jimmy back to his condo after the disaster
with Pro. They drive in silence. Then HOFFA
You think Russell would do
something about the Little Guy?
FRANK
That would be complicated.
HOFFA
I know, but maybe you could talk
to him. Have a conversation. See
what he says.
EXT. HARLEM - NIGHT - 1972
Frank and Russell climb out of Frank’s car and head for
a storefront on 115th Street - the Palma Boys Social Club
- outside which some Genovese guys hang out.
INT. PALMA BOYS SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT - 1972
Frank and Russell share a table with Anthony Fat Tony
Salerno.

SALERNO (CONT'D)
But Pro isn’t nobody, Jimmy knows
that. I’m not going to tell him
what he can and can’t say.
BUFALINO
He’s very upset, I understand.
SALERNO
I’m sure he is. But Jimmy says
things too he shouldn’t sometimes.
Somebody should calm him down.
Frank looks to Russell.
FRANK
I don’t know what to tell him to
calm him down.
SALERNO
I don’t know if it will calm him
down but you can tell him I always
liked him and won’t stand in his
way trying to get his job back.
INT. HOFFA’S DC HOTEL ROOM - DAY - 1972
The TV is on, but Jimmy and Frank aren’t watching it.
HOFFA
That doesn’t calm me down. Not
standing in my way is not the same
as doing something about a fucking
out of control lunatic.
FRANK
He’s not nobody, The Little Guy.
HOFFA
He’s a cocksucker. Fitz is a
cocksucker. I’ll deal with both
these cocksuckers myself.
EXT. TEAMSTERS’ WXDC HEADQUARTERS - DAY - 1973
Jimmy, always a magnet for reporters, stands outside
what used to be his office building, giving a televised
interview.

92
HOFFA
This used to be my office. Frank
Fitzsimmons travels around the
country to every goddamn golf
course there is. Who is he to run
around with Nixon and the Attorney
General?
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY - 1973
Fitz plays golf with Richard Nixon, John Mitchell and
Tony Pro.
HOFFA (OVERLAP)
He does this and collects a fulltime salary. How do you do that?
There’s not enough hours in a day.
I went to prison for fraud; this
is fraud what he’s doing.
EXT. DETROIT RIVER MARINA - DAY - 1973
A man and his wife walk along a dock carrying fishing
tackle and a cooler.
FRANK V/O
Fitz responded to Jimmy by sending
a message to Jimmy’s old friend,
Dave Johnson.
As they near their 45-foot cabin cruiser, it suddenly
blows up INT. HOFFA’S DC HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - 1973
A report on the TV shows the aftermath of the Dave
Johnson boat bombing. To Frank HOFFA
This is how Fitz says he wants
Dave to step down so his son can
run Local 299? By blowing up
Dave’s boat? This is how I say no
to Little Fitz.
EXT. NEMO’S BAR - DETROIT - EVENING - 1973
Fitz and his adult son Richard comes out of Nemo’s Bar.
As they walk toward Little Fitz’s white Lincoln, it blows
up, knocking them both off their feet.

93
INT. LOCAL 299 - DETROIT - DAY - 1973
Josephine Hoffa puts personal items from her desk into a
file box.
HOFFA (OVERLAP)
This is how Big Fitz says he
doesn’t like who I say runs the
299?
EXT. LOCAL 299, DETROIT - DAY - 1973
She puts the file box in the trunk of her car and climbs
in behind the wheel.
HOFFA (OVERLAP)
Firing my wife from her fortyeight-fucking-thousand-dollar-a
year union job?
Her hand shakes as she turns the key in the ignition, but
the car doesn’t blow up.
INT. HOFFA’S DC HOTEL ROOM -

NIGHT - 1973

Jimmy paces back and forth, a ginger ale in his hand,
paying no attention to the Watergate hearings on the TV.
Fine.

HOFFA
Fuck them all.

Frank is a little distracted by the Watergate witness.
E. Howard Hunt according to the TV chyron.
HOFFA
What’re you looking at.
It’s Big Ears.
What? Who?
so big.

FRANK

HOFFA
His ears don’t look

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - 1973
Jimmy is the guest on a news program.
HOFFA
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold this
union out to his underworld pals.

94
HOFFA (CONT'D)
The mob controls him, which means
it controls our Pension Fund. I’m
talking about a billion dollars in
low and no-interest loans this man
has given to known racketeers for
their illegal enterprises. Not
anymore. It’s time the rats
abandoned ship.
INT. PALMA BOYS SOCIAL CLUB - DAY - 1973
Salerno, Russell and Frank at Salerno’s table again.
Is he serious?

SALERNO

BUFALINO
He doesn’t mean any of this.
SALERNO
Maybe he got religion in prison.
He didn’t.

BUFALINO

SALERNO
People do. Remember Whispers.
The other Whispers.
BUFALINO
Not Jimmy. It’s all for the
publicity. He’s running for
office. He’s putting on a show.
SALERNO
I don’t know. When I hear a
thundering stampede I think of
getting run over by hoofs. Maybe
he means what he says.
BUFALINO
He’s campaigning. He’ll say
anything.
SALERNO
I don’t care. I don’t like it.
It’s no good. Talking like that.
Maybe he should cash in that
pension and spend more time with
his grandchildren.
Like the last time, Salerno looks to Frank.

95
SALERNO
Word should get back to him.
INT. HOFFA’S DC HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - 1973
Who said that?

HOFFA

FRANK
It doesn’t matter. It was said.
HOFFA
Was it Russell?
No.

FRANK

HOFFA
Was it the Little Cocksucker from
the Miami Fiasco?
No.
Then who.

FRANK
HOFFA

FRANK
The other Tony.
HOFFA
Which other Tony? They’re all
named Tony. What’s the matter
with Italians - they can only
think of one name.
Salerno.

FRANK

That Tony means something to Jimmy. It gives him pause.
But not enough to convince him to change what he’s doing.
HOFFA
I don’t care who said it, they’re
not going to shut me up. Somebody
can tell him that.
INT. PALMA BOYS SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT - 1973
Back at the same table with Salerno and Russell.
Tony looks at Frank -

Fat

96
SALERNO
He said that?
(Frank nods)
Before he says things like that,
he should remember: Crazy Joe
liked to make a lot of noise too.
Somebody should tell him that.

Watergate

HOFFA
He said that? This fuckin
guinea said that? That does it.
I’m never retiring. Somebody can
tell him that.
I have, Jimmy.

FRANK
Over and over.

HOFFA
Then there’s nothing more to talk
about. Let me enjoy my ice cream.
Jimmy spoons at his ice cream.
though not really to watch it.
What.
What?

Frank glances at the TV,
Eventually -

HOFFA
FRANK

HOFFA
You’re thinking something.

What

FRANK
It’s not the right time.
What isn’t.

HOFFA

FRANK
(pause)
The Local’s putting together a
testimonial dinner for me. I was
thinking of asking if you might
present the award.

97
HOFFA
Who’s going to be there?
Everybody.

FRANK

HOFFA
Tony, Tony, Tony and Tony.
FRANK
(nods)
Everybody from Downtown.
Jimmy knows he won’t exactly be safe at a place with
“everybody” there.
FRANK
It’s not a good idea right now.
I understand.
HOFFA
No, I don’t give a fuck who’s
there. They’re not going to keep
me away from your big night.
These cocksuckers. You deserve
this. I’d be honored. I’ll be
there.
Jimmy thinks about it a moment longer, then glances to
the TV. John Dean testifying, his wife sitting stoically
behind him.
HOFFA
Good looking broad, that Mo Dean.
EXT. THE LATIN CASINO - NEW JERSEY - NIGHT - 1973
The Vegas-style supper club looks like it was plucked
off Fremont Street and dropped here, but in fact was just
moved five miles from Philly across the Delaware River.
Usually it’s someone like Al Martino or Dean Martin or
Liberace on the marquee, but tonight it reads: ‘Frank
Sheeran Appreciation Night.’
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - NIGHT - 1973
We come past a poster on an easel with Frank’s picture
on it and make our way into a banquet room, past an open
bar, follow waiters serving dinner to 1,500 people. At
the microphone -

98

MCCULLOUGH
We’ve got a great turnout for
Frank tonight, because Frank’s a
man with a lot of friends. From
his army buddies who fought with
him in Italy under General George
Patton, to the drivers, national
organizers, business agents, local
presidents, joint council chairmen
and regional trustees. Tonight,
we’re all “Friends of Frank’s”,
like NAACP president, Cecil Moore;
District Attorney, Emmett
Fitzpatrick; Philadelphia Mayor,
Frank Rizzo...
As he continues introducing the dignitaries on the dais
with Frank, a title comes up on screen Roofers Union President John McCullough, shot six times
in the head in his kitchen, 1980.
MCCULLOUGH
And of course, our featured
speaker, James Riddle Hoffa.
Meanwhile, outside, in the trees,
we’ve got the FBI.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - CONTINUED - 1973
Waiters sets down plates of prime rib in front of Russell, Angelo Bruno, Tony Salerno and Tony Pro and
their wives at one table.
Skinny and other mid-level Philly guys and their wives at
another.
Frank’s wife Irene and his four grown daughters at
another table with Jimmy’s wife Jo and theirs, Barbara
and James P. Hoffa, and foster son Chuckie - Irene and Jo
marveling at how big each others’ kids have gotten.
Russell and Salerno regard Jimmy cutting into his prime
rib on the dais next to Frank.
SALERNO
He’s not even the goddamn
president and he’s holding up
people’s loans.

99

We sure? How?

BUFALINO

SALERNO
He’s using his pension fund
trustees - his guys to hold back
loans for a new hotel in New
Orleans for Carlos and loans to
build up Caesar’s on the Strip.
BUFALINO
What about Fitz? He’s gotta be
able to help.
SALERNO
The money comes through the
trustees. They gotta sign off.
They’re supposed to rubber stamp
whatever Fitz says, except Jimmy’s
got a couple of them to stop
rubber stamping.
BUFALINO
Son of a bitch.
SALERNO
He said to somebody, once Fitz is
out and he’s in, he’s going to
call in old loans. Real estate,
casinos, whatever it is, you don’t
pay him the full thing and
interest in two seconds, he’s
taking them over.
He said that?

BUFALINO

SALERNO
Who does he think he is, Castro?
Hoffa can’t hear what they’re saying down there, but
doesn’t shy from looking them in the eye when they look
up at him.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
As dessert is served, a line of fishnet-stockinged
dancers high-kick on stage.
Peggy, at the Sheeran family table, glances from the
dancers to a corner of the room Russell has found where
he can speak to Jimmy in confidence.

100
BUFALINO
I don’t understand why you’re
doing this. You don’t need the
money.
HOFFA
It’s not about money.
BUFALINO
Then I don’t understand what all
this talk is about.
It’s my union.

HOFFA

BUFALINO
I don’t know. It seems maybe it’s
about something else.
Nothing from Jimmy.
BUFALINO
Some people - not me - are a
little concerned. Some people not me - feel you - might be Might be -

HOFFA

BUFALINO
Demonstrating a failure to show
appreciation.
HOFFA
I’m not showing appreciation?
BUFALINO
Some people - not me - might think
so.
HOFFA
I went to school for five fuckin
years. I didn’t name one fuckin
name.
I know.

BUFALINO

Jimmy glances over to where Tony Pro is talking to
Salerno at his table.

101
HOFFA
I had to sit there listening to
that whining cocksucker from New
Jersey when all I wanted was to
eat my ice cream in peace.
I know.

BUFALINO

HOFFA
This cocksucker shows up to a
meeting fifteen minutes late in
fucking shorts. Who wears shorts
to a meeting?
I know.

BUFALINO

HOFFA
I’m not showing appreciation?
BUFALINO
According to some people - not me.
Fuck them.
Hoffa.

HOFFA
Nobody threatens

As Jimmy walks away, everything in room slows down. From
the dais, Frank watches, more than a little concerned.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy shouldn’t have walked away
first. He should have let Russell
walk away.
Russell just stands there, looking after Jimmy, no doubt
thinking the same thing.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
Russell, Salerno and Pro watch Jimmy up at the podium,
finishing his presentation to Frank HOFFA
Frank has devoted his life to
this union. As a driver, as an
organizer, as a mediator - he’s
been tireless in his service to
the working men and women of this
country.
(MORE)

102
HOFFA (CONT'D)
He also holds a record you may not
know, which I don’t think anybody
will ever beat: Most arrests on a
picket line - 26 times in 24
hours - beating my record!
The guests applaud and laugh.
HOFFA
I’ve known Frank a long time.
I respect him. I rely on him.
He is a union man to his bones,
and he’s my friend. I’m honored
to present this award - and this
beautiful watch - to Frank
Sheeran.
Frank joins him at the podium as everyone applauds.
Jimmy straps a gold diamond-encrusted watch on his wrist,
pats him on the back, turns the microphone over to him.
FRANK
Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you all.
Thank you to my wife Irene and my
lovely daughters, Maryanne,
Dolores, Connie - Peggy - for
putting up with me all these
years.
Three of his daughters are smiling.

Peggy isn’t.

FRANK
And to Jimmy. I can’t tell you
what this means to me to get this
honor from you. Jimmy’s the only
guy to get the job done and I
promise all my support and help to
you, Jimmy.
(mild applause)
Russ bet me I was going to mess up
my speech... so all I can say is,
thank you all from the bottom of
my heart. I know I don’t deserve
all this tonight. But I have
bursitis and I don’t deserve that
either.
(laughs)
See Russ, I didn’t mess up my
speech.
Everyone laughs.

103
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
A photographer motions Frank and Jimmy to stand together
for a picture HOFFA
Look at all these people who
came out for you. Even the mayor.
I truly had no idea you were this
strong.
FRANK
It’s a free steak and an open bar.
HOFFA
No, they’re here for you, my
friend.
The camera flashes.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Couple more, please.
FRANK
I’m sorry Pro’s here.
HOFFA
You have no control over that.
The camera flashes.
HOFFA
I really do appreciate all the
support you’ve given me, Frank.
I mean it. It’s not just words.
I’m glad you’re on my side.
Frank forces a smile for the photographer as the camera
flashes again taking a photo of Frank with Jimmy, another
with Cecil Moore, another with Mayor Rizzo, another with
Jimmy’s kids.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
Jerry Vale’s singing ‘Spanish Eyes’ as couples dance.
Jimmy’s dancing with Frank’s daughter Peggy, and each
time they turn, she looks over at Russell and Salerno looking right at her - or rather at
Jimmy - as they quietly converse at their table. Salerno
doesn’t look happy, gets up and leaves, followed by Pro.

104
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
Back at the Sheeran family table, Peggy’s watching her
father with Russell who have found a semi-private spot to
talk across the room.
BUFALINO
I didn’t want to do this in front
of everybody.
He hands Frank a small jewelry box. Inside it, Frank
finds a gold ring with a gold coin on top.
BUFALINO
Only three people in the world
have one of these, and only one
of them is Irish. I have one.
Angelo. And now you.
(pause)
You know what this means.
Frank does. It’s as close to a made-man any non-Italian
will ever get.
FRANK
I don’t know what to say.
Put it on.

BUFALINO
Let’s see if it fits.

Frank slips the ring on.
another song.

It fits.

Jerry Vale starts

BUFALINO
There’s something else. It just
got out of hand with your friend.
Some people have a serious problem
with him. Talk to your friend.
Tell him, it’s what it is.
Frank isn’t sure he heard right.
FRANK
It’s what it is?
BUFALINO
Yeah. Talk to him.
FRANK
I’ll do my best. You know
yourself, Russ; he’s tough to talk
to.

105
BUFALINO
He’s got no choice. It comes from
high up.
FRANK
Jimmy’s pretty high up himself.
BUFALINO
You’re dreaming, my friend. If
they can take out the President
they can take out the president
of a union.
And, as it’s supposed to work, Russell walks away first.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT - 1973
As the dancing continues, Frank and Jimmy, off by
themselves, talk.
FRANK
I just spoke to Russell. He just
spoke to Tony. He means what he’s
saying.
Who?
Tony.

Russell?

HOFFA
FRANK

HOFFA
Well, I mean what I say. He
can’t seem to get that through his
fat fuckin Sicilian head.
Jimmy notices how ashen-faced Frank looks.
HOFFA
Don’t look so concerned.
FRANK
I’m a little concerned.
HOFFA
They should be concerned, not
you.
FRANK
They are. They’re more than a
little concerned. There’s
widespread concern.

106
FRANK (CONT'D)
Tony told Russell to tell me to
tell you what it is.
Jimmy looks at Frank a bit stunned finally.
HOFFA
They wouldn’t dare.
FRANK
Don’t say that, Jimmy.
HOFFA
Something funny happens to me, I
got stuff ready to go. To the
press. To the right people. They
do something to me, something is
gonna be done to them, and those
guinea motherfuckers know that.
They know I know things that I
know. They know I know things they
think I don’t know.
FRANK
Jimmy, what am I supposed to do.
I got to go back and tell the old
man - what. That you’re still not
listening to him? He ain’t used
to people not listening to him.
Neither am I.

HOFFA

Frank has run out of ways to make him see.
FRANK
Then I don’t know, you should
maybe keep some bodies around for
protection.
HOFFA
I’m not going that route, they
could go after my family. You
should keep some bodies around,
they could go after you since
you’re with me.
Frank isn’t sure who he’s with anymore, so caught in the
middle.
HOFFA
Tell Russ I got nothing but
respect for him. I would never
hurt him. But this is my union.

Jimmy leaves him to go to the Sheeran family table.
HOFFA
You know what I love, Peggy?
Ice cream.

Jimmy dancing with Peggy. Frank, at his family’s table
now, watches them, a more-than-a-little-concerned look on
his face, though Peggy, noticing it, can’t imagine why.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
The same concerned look on Frank’s face here.

Then -

FRANK
The wedding was all well and
good, but the real point of our
trip to Detroit was a peace
mission.
EXT. GAS STATION - OHIO - DAY - 1975
An attendant checks the oil. The women are buying
cigarettes from a machine while Russell buys some candy
from another. Frank’s making a call in a phone booth.
INTERCUT with Jimmy at his Lake Orion house outside
Detroit.
FRANK
I’m with the old man. We’re
driving up. He hopes this thing
can be worked out.
What’d he say?

HOFFA

FRANK
He said let’s work this thing
out. Sit down after the wedding
and work it out.

108
HOFFA
I’m not going to the wedding.
Too many people I don’t like are
going to be there.
FRANK
We could do it at your place if
you want.
HOFFA
At the lake, huh.
Or anywhere.

FRANK

HOFFA
From day one I wanted to work
this out.
I know.

FRANK

HOFFA
From day fucking one.
I know.

FRANK

HOFFA
Just you two, right?
Little Guy.

Not the

FRANK
Of course the Little Guy.
No.

HOFFA
Just the three of us.

FRANK
There’s no point just the three of
us.
HOFFA
I’m not sitting down with that
cocksucker.
FRANK
It’s time to sit down, Jimmy.
Everybody says so.
Not with him.

HOFFA

109
FRANK
You’re making me work hard.
Just us.

HOFFA

Jimmy hangs up. Frank lets himself out of the booth.
Russell comes over unwrapping a candy bar.
What’d he say?

BUFALINO

FRANK
He’s thinking about it.
BUFALINO
That’s good. That’s progress.

The Sheerans and Bufalinos checking into a Howard
Johnson’s motel.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSON’S - OHIO - LATER - DAY - 1975
Russell hangs up a pay phone and crosses a patio past
Irene and Carrie wading in the pool with swimming caps on
to where Frank’s at a patio table with a Tab, sits.
BUFALINO
You should give Jimmy another
call, don’t you think? See if
he’s thought about it.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSON’S - OHIO - LATER - DAY - 1975
Frank on the same pay phone near the pool Russell was on,
again INTERCUT with Jimmy at his Lake Orion house HOFFA
When you getting in?
FRANK
Tomorrow morning.
HOFFA
Good. I changed my mind about
the other thing.

110

You did?

FRANK

HOFFA
I’m meeting with the Little Guy
tomorrow afternoon.
FRANK
With the Little Guy.
HOFFA
Tony Jack set it up.
FRANK
With the Little Guy.

Where?

HOFFA
In public, where do you think.
The Red Fox. On Telegraph. You
know it?
FRANK
Tony Jack is Pro’s cousin.
HOFFA
They’re all fucking cousins,
what are you going to do. But
Jack’s okay. I talked with him
several times after the Fiasco-InMiami.
FRANK
I’d feel better if I was there.
HOFFA
So would I, that’s why I asked
when you’re getting in.
FRANK
What time’s the meeting?
HOFFA
2:30, and he better not be late.
Or wearing fuckin shorts.
The Red Fox.

FRANK

HOFFA
On Telegraph. I’ll be there at 2.
So you should be there at 2.
FRANK
I’ll be there at 2.

111
HOFFA

Good.

Jimmy hangs up. Frank hangs up, a little puzzled about
Jimmy’s change of heart. Walks back to the patio table.
What’d he say?

BUFALINO

FRANK
He’s going to meet with Pro.
That’s good.

BUFALINO

FRANK
Tony Jack arranged it.
That’s good.

BUFALINO

And that’s it. No other comment. Which Frank finds a
little odd after all that’s gone on with this.
FRANK V/O
Maybe Jimmy was counting on Pro
to act like Pro so Tony Jack could
see Jimmy being reasonable and Pro
being unreasonable like in Miami,
and tell Salerno.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSON’S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING - 1975
Frank and Irene change into something nice for dinner,
like people used to do.
FRANK V/O
Or maybe this wedding really was
bringing everybody together.
There’s a knock on the door. Russell and Carrie dressed nicely, too - Russell holding the bag with a
loaf of prosciutto bread in it. As they all leave FRANK V/O
Whatever it was, you’d think
Russell would’ve asked when the
meeting was, where it was, whether
he was supposed to come or not.
Something.
The door closes.

We remain in the empty motel room.

112
FRANK V/O
But he didn’t ask anything.
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - OHIO - NIGHT - 1975
Carrie and Irene sit alone at the best table in the
restaurant, sipping cocktails and smoking like you used
to be able to do.
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - SAME TIME - 1975
Russell, who owns the place, or part of it, prepares
his special salad dressing in the restaurant’s kitchen,
mixing olive oil, balsamic and ginger root, the loaf of
prosciutto bread next to it.
BUFALINO
By the way, we got a little
change in plans. We’re going to
hang around here tomorrow morning
and drive up in the afternoon.
FRANK
I told Jimmy we’d be there in
the morning.
I know.

BUFALINO

FRANK
That I’d be at the meeting with
him and Pro.
I know.

BUFALINO

Frank does okay not showing it, but is reeling from
Russell telling him he’s not going to let him be with
Jimmy at the meeting.
BUFALINO
We did all we could for the man,
Cheech.
Russell looks to Frank for a nod that he understands,
but Frank doesn’t nod. Russell swirls the salad dressing
in the jar around and dips a finger in to taste it.
BUFALINO
Don’t call him.

INT. HOWARD JOHNSON’S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - 1975
Frank lies awake in bed next to his sleeping wife,
staring at the phone on the night stand next to him.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSON’S LOBBY - EARLY MORNING - 1975
Frank comes down to the breakfast room. Russell is the
only other guest there this early, filling a plastic bowl
from an individual-serving box of cornflakes.
Morning.
Good morning.

How’d you sleep?
Fine.

BUFALINO
Want some Total?
Okay.

won’t be gone long. Three hours
tops.

Russell eats his.

FRANK
What’s in Port Clinton?
A plane.

BUFALINO

Frank

114
FRANK
A plane.
(Russell nods)
To where?
Detroit.

BUFALINO

This isn’t making any sense to Frank.
FRANK
We’re going to Detroit now?
BUFALINO
You’re going to Detroit now.
Then you’re coming back. Then
we’ll take our time driving up
there. Nice leisurely drive.
And fuckin cigarette breaks.
Frank has no idea what he’s talking about, but doesn’t
like it, whatever it is.
BUFALINO
I got to put you into the thing,
Frank. Otherwise you’d never let
it happen. And it’s gonna happen.
Russell looks at Frank like a father to a son.
BUFALINO
Either way, Jimmy will be gone,
but this way, and it’s only out of
respect for me they agreed to it
by the way, everything will be
okay for you and Irene, because
you’re with me.
He eats his cornflakes.
INT. LINCOLN - MOVING - HIGHWAY 80, OHIO - DAY - 1975
As Frank drives, Russell sits in the passenger seat
looking placidly out at the scenery through his thick
glasses.
EXT. AIRSTRIP - PORT CLINTON - OHIO - DAY - 1975
They drive onto a grass airstrip on the edge of Lake
Erie where a small plane waits. Frank parks, shuts it
off, leaves the keys in the ignition, gets out. Russell
stays in the car.

115
Frank climbs the steps of the plane and sits in one of
its six seats. The pilot closes the door without looking
at him and returns to the cockpit. As the plane begins
to taxi, Frank looks out the window at the Lincoln.
EXT. MICHIGAN - DAY - 1975
The plane descends over the north shore of Lake Erie.
Lands on the Pontiac Airfield.
The pilot lowers the steps and Frank climbs out and walks
to a parked Ford that’s empty. He gets in, finds its
keys under the mat, starts it up.
INT/EXT. FORD - MICHIGAN - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Frank drives along Telegraph Road. Opens the glove
compartment, notes the little .22 in it, closes it, sees
Machus Red Fox restaurant up ahead, checks the gold watch
Jimmy presented him with at the Latin Club: 2:05.
As he passes the Red Fox, he can see Jimmy sitting in his
green Pontiac in the lot.
INT. HOFFA’S CAR - PARKED - SAME TIME - 1975
Jimmy doesn’t notice the Ford pass by. He’s looking at
his own watch, and beginning to get annoyed Frank is five
minutes late.
EXT. PONTIAC, MICHIGAN - DAY - 1975
Frank makes a left onto Seven Mile Road. Drives across a
railroad bridge. Then down a residential street with old
modest houses on half acre lots.
He checks an address scribbled on a Howard Johnson’s
napkin. Pulls over and regards a brick-and-shingled
house.
He notes a Buick parked at the end of a single-lane
driveway running alongside the house. Opens the glove
box and takes out the .22.
He gets out of the car, shoves the pistol in his back
waist-band under his jacket, climbs the steps of the
house and opens the unlocked front door -

116
INT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS - 1975
A man on his hands and knees looks up at Frank through
Coke-bottle glasses.
Hi, Frank.

SALLY BUGS

Sally has a matte-knife in his hand and uses it to cut
some linoleum he’s laying out on top of the wood floor of
the entry.
Sally.

FRANK

Frank surveys the entry. Then walks into the adjacent
living room, glimpsing as he goes two young Italian guys
in the kitchen down the hall, playing cards. Sally Bugs
comes over, parts the living room blinds and looks out.
SALLY BUGS
Chuckie’s late.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy’s son Chuckie, his foster
son, he was in the thing, too, but
didn’t know it.
Sally Bugs sees a car pulling to the curb.
Is that him?

SALLY BUGS

It’s a maroon Mercury Marquis with just the driver in it.
Frank nods.
FRANK V/O
All Chuckie knew, he was picking
up one of Pro’s guys and me and we
were all picking up his dad at the
Red Fox for a meeting.
Chuckie gets out of the car. Leans against the car,
waiting, wearing a wide-collared paisley shirt and gold
chains.
FRANK V/O
He was in it, as you say,
stupidly.

117
EXT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - MOMENTS LATER - 1975
Frank and Sally Bugs come out of the house and approach
the Mercury.
I’m Sally.
Hi.

SALLY BUGS

CHUCKIE
Hi, Frank.

Chuckie.

FRANK

SALLY BUGS
Let’s go. I don’t want your
father yelling at me for being
late. You can sit in front,
Frank.
Frank doesn’t want to sit in front. Sally Bugs, we may
recall, strangled that poor Teamster Treasurer in a front
seat. But Sally already has the car’s back door open and
is sliding in.
SALLY BUGS
The fuck is this?
What.

CHUCKIE

SALLY BUGS
It’s wet back here.
CHUCKIE
I had a frozen fish I had to drop
off to someone.
A fish?

Sorry.

SALLY BUGS
The seat is wet from a

FRANK
I’ll sit back there.
SALLY BUGS
No, no, no, it’s all right, you
take the front.

118
As Frank reluctantly climbs into the front passenger
seat, Sally Bugs lays his handkerchief on the back seat
and sits on it.
INT. MERCURY - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Chuckie makes a right off Seven Mile Road onto Telegraph.
Frank is still uneasy, concerned Sally might strangle him
from behind.
SALLY BUGS
What kind of fish.
What?

CHUCKIE

SALLY BUGS
What kind of fish.
I don’t know.

CHUCKIE
A fish.

To eat.

SALLY BUGS
You don’t know what kind?
No.

CHUCKIE

SALLY BUGS
Where’d you get it?
CHUCKIE
At a fish place.
Frank checks his watch.

It’s 2:40.

EXT. MACHUS RED FOX RESTAURANT - DAY - 1975
Jimmy hangs up a pay phone behind the restaurant and
heads for his Pontiac. Wearing a polo shirt and slacks
there’s no way he’s carrying a piece. The Mercury honks.
Jimmy stares at it a moment, then comes over.
CHUCKIE
Sorry I’m late.
HOFFA
Late? What the fuck you even
doing here? Who invited you?
Hi, Jimmy.

SALLY BUGS

119
HOFFA
Who the fuck are you?
I’m with Pro.

SALLY BUGS

HOFFA
You’re with Pro. You’re with this
cocksucker who’s late again? I’m
not waiting for this cocksucker
again. He was supposed to be here
at 2:30. It’s 2:40. I don’t wait
for anybody more than ten minutes.
Mother fucking cocksucker.
SALLY BUGS
He’s at the house.
HOFFA

What house?

SALLY BUGS
He’s with Russ.
HOFFA
He’s with Russ ... What the fuck
is going on here?
SALLY BUGS
Look who’s here.
Jimmy leans down to see who’s in the passenger seat.
FRANK

Hi, Jimmy.

HOFFA
Frank. What the fuck’s going on
here? Where were you? You were
supposed to be here at two. What
is this?
FRANK
Russell decided to come. But not
here. He doesn’t know the place.
It’s not comfortable for him.
McGee is here?

HOFFA
In Detroit?

FRANK
To help straighten all this out.
That changes things.

Jimmy relaxes a little.

120
SALLY BUGS
We’ll bring you back after to get
your car.
Sally Bugs pushes open the back door for Jimmy to get in
and the motion slows down FRANK V/O
No way in a million years Jimmy
would ever get in a car with one
of Pro’s guys in it ... unless I
was in it, too. Which is why I
was in it. I made it safe.
The motion returns to normal as Sally Bugs taps the seat
next to him.
SALLY BUGS
There was a fish in here, but I
cleaned it up.
What?

HOFFA

SALLY BUGS
Chuckie had a fuckin fish in
here, he doesn’t even know what
kind, but it’s okay now, I wiped
it up.

For Bobby Holmes. Bobby likes

SALLY BUGS
I cleaned it up, Jimmy. It’s all
right.
HOFFA
You cleaned it up, the fuck you
know about fish? You ever caught
a fucking fish in your life?
No.

SALLY BUGS

HOFFA
Then you don’t know.

121
Jimmy glances off to his own car, then back to Frank
again as if to say, Promise me this is okay. Frank nods.
FRANK
It’s all right.
Jimmy finally gets into the back seat next to Sally.
HOFFA
Chuckie, never put a fish in
your car, you’ll never get the
smell out. Unless it’s wrapped
up good.
I know.

CHUCKIE

The Mercury pulls out of the lot.
INT. CHUCKIE’S MERCURY - MOVING - DAY - 1975
The Mercury drives the same route Frank took earlier.
HOFFA
Frank. You couldn’t come by at
2:00 and tell me this? I had to
wait there forty minutes like a
fuckin moron?
FRANK
I came as soon as I got in.
HOFFA
You got in this morning.
FRANK
No. Russell had some business in
Port Clinton this morning.
HOFFA
This morning. Okay. But it’s
this afternoon. All due respect
to Russ but nobody could come over
at 2:00 and tell me it was 2:30?
2:40? At the very least?
(like Sally’s not there)
And who the fuck is Pro sending a
fucking errand boy.
FRANK
Sally’s not staying.

122
HOFFA
That’s right he’s not staying.
But Pro sent him is the point I’m
making, when he should’ve come
picked me up himself.
(to Sally)
Can you even see out those
glasses?
SALLY BUGS
I can see, Jimmy.
EXT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS - 1975
The Mercury pulls into the driveway behind the Buick and
the Ford and idles. Jimmy and Frank get out. Sally Bugs
comes around and gets into the passenger seat.
As Chuckie backs the car out, Jimmy and Frank head for
the house. Jimmy - as he always does with whoever he’s
with - walks ahead.
HOFFA
You got your friend with you?
Glancing back, he sees Frank touch the small of his back.
HOFFA
Good. You never know with this
cocksucker, with or without Russ
there.
He opens the front door and INT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS - 1975
As soon as he’s inside, Jimmy knows there’s a problem.
He should hear voices - but it’s quiet. And there’s no
one in the living room, which he can see from here in the
entry. And there’s this badly-cut piece of linoleum
under his feet.
The motion slows to a stop.
FRANK V/O
He knew right away what it was.
FIVE QUICK VIGNETTES (1975):
A flurry of feathers: Tony Pro with his racing pigeons
on the roof of Union Hall in New Jersey -

123
A Yankees game on a TV: Tony Salerno watching it in the
Palma Boys Social Club in East Harlem A golf ball chipped out of a sand trap:
on a golf course in San Clemente -

Fitz and Nixon

Frank’s Lincoln: Russell napping in the parked car on
the Port Clinton airstrip Reflections in the Howard Johnson’s pool. Irene and
Carrie next to it on chaise lounges, smoking cigarettes maybe putting suntan lotion on each other.
FRANK V/O
Just not my part of it.
BACK TO THE HOUSE - THE IMAGE UNFREEZING - 1975
HOFFA
Let’s get out of here, Frank.
As Jimmy bumps past Frank to leave, grasping the knob of
the door Frank just closed, Frank shoots him twice behind
his right ear.
He slumps to the floor. Blood runs onto the temporary
linoleum. Frank glances down the hall to see if someone
is going to come kill him now - which wouldn’t surprise
him - but no one appears.
Frank tries to open the front door but Jimmy’s body is
against it. He gently tugs Jimmy away from it, gets it
open, wipes the .22 with a handkerchief and sets it on
Jimmy, wipes the door knob, and leaves.
EXT. PORT CLINTON AIRSTRIP - LATER - DAY - 1975
The plane lands, taxis to a stop. The pilot, again
careful not to look at Frank, lowers the steps. Frank
comes down them and crosses to the Lincoln, where Russell
is napping.
Frank climbs in, shuts the door. Russell wakes at the
sound of it. Just by looking at Frank, he can tell the
little errand in Detroit has been taken care of.
Frank starts the car and they drive off to pick up their
wives at the Howard Johnson’s.

124
INT. CHURCH - DETROIT - NEXT DAY - 1975
Teamster lawyer Bill Bufalino - who represented Frank
against the meat packing company long ago - and Hoffa in
Nashville - escorts his daughter down the aisle.
The church is packed with friends and relatives of the
bride and groom, union and mob guys, Russell and Carrie
with Frank and Irene. Frank just stares straight ahead.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - PHILADELPHIA - DAY - 1975
A TV broadcasts a news report on Hoffa’s disappearance.
He’s been missing a couple days now. Frank comes in from
outside, takes his coat off, regards the TV and his wife
and daughters who are watching it.
Still no word?

FRANK

Irene shakes her head no.

Frank pours himself a drink.

FRANK
I should call Jo.
IRENE
You haven’t called her yet?
Frank shakes his head no. Irene turns back to the TV
report. Peggy doesn’t. She studies her father.
Why.
Why what.

PEGGY
FRANK

PEGGY
Why haven’t you called her.
The image of the family slows ...
FRANK V/O
Maybe it was I looked hard
instead of worried. Or that I
should have been rushing out to
hurt somebody, and wasn’t.
Whatever it was, she knew.
The image returns to normal.
FRANK
I’ll call her now.

125
Peggy watches her father turn and head upstairs.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
She stopped talking to me that
day. August 3rd, 1975.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
Frank looks as thoughtful and concerned as he ever has.
FRANK
She’s got a good job and lives
outside Philly now but my daughter
Peggy disappeared from my life
that day.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY - 1975
Alone in his bedroom, Frank sits on the edge of his bed
dialing a phone. He can hear the report from downstairs
faintly up here as people who know nothing theorize about
the disappearance. The call connects.
FRANK
It’s Frank.
(listens, nods)
Whatever you need, anything I can
do, I’m here.
Jo?

She’s crying now. He puts the receiver to his head like
it’s a gun ... then back to his ear.
FRANK
It’s gonna be all right.
sure he’s all right.

EXT. HOUSE - PONTIAC, MICHIGAN - FOUR NIGHTS BEFORE
The two Italians who were playing cards in the kitchen
carry the body, in a body bag, out the back door and dump
it in the trunk of the Buick. They toss in the bloody
linoleum and .22 pistol.
EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - PONTIAC - FOUR NIGHTS BEFORE
They lift the body from the trunk and carry it to the
back door of a funeral parlor.

126
FRANK V/O
Anybody that says Jimmy was
shipped in a 55-gallon drum to a
dump in New Jersey or to the end
zone in Giants Stadium never had a
body on their hands.
INT. CREMATORY - PONTIAC - FOUR NIGHTS BEFORE
They put Jimmy’s body in a cardboard coffin into a
cremation oven. Toss in the linoleum and the empty .22.
The gas jets burn so hot they turn everything to ash bones, teeth - even melting the pistol and Jimmy’s watch
and wedding ring - and the spent bullets in his head.
The furnace finishes. The cinders of the coffin have
fallen away to reveal the form of an ashy body, like at
Pompeii.
The two Italians poke at it with rubber-gloved hands,
reducing it to gritty sand-like ashes.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
FRANK
It was no more complicated than
that.
INT. GRAND JURY COURTROOM - DAY - 1976
Frank is being questioned by an Assistant U.S. Attorney.
FRANK V/O
Everybody who ever had anything
to do with Jimmy was hauled in and
questioned. And everybody took
the Fifth, which is what you do.
FRANK
On the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to answer
that question under the protection
afforded me by the Constitution,
on the grounds that my answer
might tend to incriminate me.
ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY
Let me ask you this: What color is
my pen?

127
FRANK
On the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY - 1976
Frank and his lawyer head for the back exit.
FRANK V/O
Still, everybody got indicted
and convicted of one thing or
another, just not for that.
Nobody, as you know, even went to
jail for that. And nobody talked.
Which is unusual since usually
three people can keep a secret
only when two are dead.
INT. THE HOUSE IN PONTIAC - DAY - FLASHBACK - 1975
The two Italians playing cards in the kitchen FRANK V/O
Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi got
twenty years for squeezing cash

Tony Pro walks down a cell block with other inmates FRANK V/O
Pro was convicted with them, but
he was already back in school for
that other matter I mentioned
before INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY - FLASHBACK - 1961
The man in the passenger seat finds the radio station he
wants and sits back.
FRANK V/O
That poor union Treasurer Tony

Pro on.

As the nylon rope loops around the guy’s neck to strangle
him, Coke bottle glasses on a face come into frame.
FRANK V/O
Sally Bugs, you recall, did that
one.
EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - 1978
From far away, someone watches Sally Bugs walk from his
car to the building.
FRANK V/O
One day he was seen walking into
the Federal building.
INT. VILLA DI ROMA - NIGHT - 1978
Russell and Frank sitting together at the usual table.
BUFALINO
That by itself isn’t a crime.
Everybody gets called in there
sometime. But Sally - who knows
better - didn’t tell nobody about it.
Not a word to anybody. And then, you
know, between one thing and another,
it meant one thing: He wasn’t going
in there for lunch.
Frank nods. He knows he’s just been told what to do by
not being told not to do it.
EXT. LITTLE ITALY - NEW YORK - NIGHT - 1978
Sally comes out of the Andrea Doria Social Club on
Mulberry Street. Frank and John Francis walk up to him.
Hi, Sal.
Hi, Frank.

FRANK
SALLY BUGS

Sally looks at John Francis, who he doesn’t know. As
he waits for an introduction, Frank shoots him twice in
the head - one of the bullets shattering a lens of his
thick glasses. He hits the ground and John Francis fires
three shots into Sally’s belly. As they walk away -

129
FRANK V/O
It turns out Sally did tell
somebody he had to go in there.
They just forgot to tell somebody
else. So it was a bad hit.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY - 1978
Tony Salerno on a surgical table getting a colonoscopy.
FRANK V/O
Fat Tony Salerno they got on an
income tax thing. A little while
after he was diagnosed with
prostate cancer.
INT. VESUVIO - DAY - 1976
Russell having what seems to be a normal conversation
with another man at a table, Jimmy The Weasel Fratianno.
BUFALINO
You know there’s a pork store in
Walnut Creek, California, Jimmy.
It’s right near where you live.
You ever go there?
FRANK V/O
Russell got hooked for telling
Jimmy “The Weasel” to strangle
Jack Napoli over 25 grand of
jewelry Jack took on credit and
never paid for.
EXT. PENN DRAPE & CURTAINS - DAY - 1976
Russell is escorted out in cuffs by federal agents.
FRANK V/O
Only The Weasel flipped. They
called it Conspiracy to Kill a
Witness, though it was Napoli who
was clearly in the wrong.
EXT. CAR WASH - DAY - 1978
The conveyor draws a 1978 black Lincoln Continental into
the car wash tunnel. Overhead nozzles turn on and spray
the car with water.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY - 1980

and labor racketeering charges and
some other things A title appears: Murder, Attempted Murder, Intimidation,
Embezzlement, Arson
Frank in the witness box where he’s been for awhile.
FRANK
I’m going to say to you one time,
I’ve listened to you, now you
listen to me. I’ve worked for 44
years, and I never took one dime
illegal off Boffa or nobody else.
What you think don’t interest me.
All I know is I paid him. What he
does with the money is his
business.
EXT. CRANE COMPANY - MARYLAND - NIGHT - 1977
Silhouettes of some building cranes and other heavy
equipment against the night sky outside Baltimore.
FRANK V/O
But all they got me for was
blowing up the office of a crane
company that fired two of my shop
stewards for no good reason The place blows up.
FRANK V/O
And for my Lincoln.
INT. CAR WASH - DAY - CONTINUED - 1978
Frank’s car inches through the car wash covered in suds.
FRANK V/O
I bought it from Eugene Boffa,
who leased truck drivers to
freight companies and paid them
substandard wages, skimming the
difference.

131
Frank peers through soapy windows of the car wash at
his Lincoln as leather tongues shimmy and sway and push
the suds around.
FRANK V/O
They said I paid under-market
value for the car, and I had no
receipts to prove otherwise. They
said the car was a bribe to let
Boffa continue to pay his nonunion wages.
Frank watches the Lincoln as spray-hoses rinse it and the
dryer blowers switch on.
FRANK V/O
I loved that car, but it wasn’t
worth the eighteen years they gave
me for it.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD PRISON - DAY - 1991
A prison set down amidst bare trees in Missouri.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD PRISON - DAY - 1991
Bundled up against the cold, Russell, Salerno and some
other old inmates in wheelchairs roll bocce balls on a
snow-patched fenced-in rooftop exercise yard.
FRANK V/O
Russell had a stroke. Fat Tony
Salerno couldn’t control his urine
anymore. My arthritis that
started in the foxholes of Anzio
was eating at my lower back now,
and I couldn’t feel much in my
feet neither. I needed a cane,
but they won’t give you a cane in
prison since you could use it as a
weapon. Neurontin helped a little
but it also makes you loopy.
Frank, who’s getting no younger himself, watches from the
sidelines.
FRANK V/O
We were all falling apart in the
freezing fucking cold.

132
INT. SPRINGFIELD PRISON CAFETERIA - DAY - 1991
Frank comes in with a paper bag, limps across the
cafeteria, sits with Russell. Seeing the bag You got it.

BUFALINO

Frank nods. Takes grape juice and prosciutto bread from
the bag and begins breaking it into pieces. Eventually BUFALINO
Jimmy was a nice man. Nice
family. I didn’t want it to go
that far.
I know.

FRANK

Frank pours two glasses of grape juice. Russell’s hand
tremors a bit as he dips a piece of bread in the juice.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD PRISON - DAY - 1991
Frank comes out to the exercise yard as Russell in his
wheelchair is being pushed by another inmate the other
way.
FRANK
Where you going?
To church.
To what?

BUFALINO
FRANK

BUFALINO
Don’t laugh, my friend, you’ll go
too, the time comes.
Frank watches Russell as his wheelchair rolls along the
frozen ground.
FRANK V/O
Russell went to church. Then
he went to the prison hospital.
Then he went to the graveyard.

133
EXT. GRAVEYARD - YEADON, PA - DAY - 1995
The number of people in attendance seems too small for
someone of Russell’s stature, which makes sense since it
isn’t his funeral.
FRANK V/O
I got out that October. Irene
died in December. December 23rd.
Lung cancer. No surprise.
Frank stands at his wife’s grave with three of his
grown daughters, supporting himself on two aluminum canes
like a polio victim.
Peggy’s there, too, but stands apart from her sisters and
father. He looks at her, but she won’t look at him.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT - 1995
Frank moves around the house on his canes, emptying
ashtrays of butts with his wife’s lipstick marks on the
filters.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY - 1996
He sits in a chair in front of a TV he’s not watching,
drinking wine alone.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY - 1996
He fills a plastic container marked with the days of the
week with dozens of pills, gets confused and starts over.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1998
He comes past in his pajamas to go to the bathroom,
negotiating a dark hallway on his canes. Trips and falls
and can’t get up.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - LOUNGE ROOM - DAY - 1998
The elderly men and women, dotting the rec room like
checkers on an abandoned board, playing cards and dominoes
and Candyland.
Frank sits apart from them in a wheelchair, the white
shirt, the gold watch, the gold ring, his eyes hidden
behind the aviator sunglasses.

134
He’s been here for months. And no one but him is
watching the TV with the sound down low: Images of the
war in Kosovo. Bombs. Carnage. Death.

INT. BANK - DAY - 2000
He comes in on his canes. Stands in a short line.
Looks around like he’s casing the place. Makes it to
the front, but lets someone go ahead of him so he can
wait for a particular window.
The customer there leaves and he starts toward it. The
teller, his daughter Peggy, sees him coming and puts her
“closed” sign up before he gets there.
Peggy, don’t.

She walks away from the counter toward the back. Goes

to her.

FRANK
Tell her I want to talk

135
DOLORES
Talk to her and tell her what?
FRANK
I want to tell her I’m sorry.
For?

DOLORES

FRANK
I know I wasn’t such a good
father. I tried to be. I tried
to protect her. All of you.
From what?

DOLORES

Now that he thinks about it, he’s not sure what.
DOLORES
You have no idea what it was
like for us. We couldn’t come to
you with a problem because of what
you’d do. We couldn’t go to you
for protection because of the
terrible things you’d do.
FRANK
But I was just trying to keep you
from getting hurt.
Dolores regards him a moment. He looks helpless.
Hapless. Hopeless. Eventually DOLORES
No. No. You weren’t a bad father.
That’s what he wants to hear, but by itself, it seems
qualified, which it is.
DOLORES
We were just afraid of you.
INT. CASKET STORE - ANOTHER DAY - 2000
They build them and sell them here. It’s more like a
workshop inside a warehouse. The salesman used to be a
rock and roll promoter, but now he does this, wearing a
porkpie hat.

136
SALESMAN
I could sell you something for
a lot of money but I’ll be honest
with you: It makes no sense going
with anything more expensive than
particle board for cremation.
Will it be cremation?
Burial.

FRANK

SALESMAN
Okay, that’s going to be more.
That’s okay.

FRANK

Frank surveys the rows of caskets from his wheelchair,
the orderly by his side.
SALESMAN
Is it for a man or a woman?
It’s for me.

FRANK

His eyes settle on a metal one, green as the green on the
Irish flag.
That one.

FRANK

EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY - DAY - 2000
The orderly again waits for Frank outside, smoking
another cigarette, idly looking off at a backhoe digging
a grave. He notices a parked black car. Two men in it.
Just sitting.
INT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY - DAY - 2000
A marble wall of mausoleum crypts. Most - the good
ones at eye-level or thereabouts - have names on them. A
few - the undesirably-placed available ones - are bare.
FRANK (IN SYNC)
We're all terminal. And sooner or
later. Everybody put here has a
date when he’s gonna go. And I
think... it could be... there's
gotta be something somewhere.
(MORE)

137
FRANK (IN SYNC) (CONT'D)
There's gotta be something when
you go cause how the hell did this
whole thing start? What they
taught you as a kid? People
smarter than me can't figure it
out. But there's gotta be
something to it. So if there's
something good... if it is... I
want a shot at it. That’s why I
would never go for cremation. It's
so final. That’s the hardest part
of anybody when they bury is when
they go into the ground. Because
it's so final. You know what I
mean? If you go into a building.
The building's there. Your crypt
is there. It has to be a metal
casket and they have you in the
room. And all that there. It's
just not as final - you're dead but it's not as final.
Frank stands before them, considering them. There’s no
good choice - or bad choice for that matter. A girl from
the office with a diagram on a clipboard waits for him to
decide. Doesn’t rush him. Finally, he points.
FRANK
That one, I guess.
EXT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
The same black car from the cemetery parked here now.
The two men who were in it - young FBI agents - sit with
Frank on the porch of the building. He actually seems
fine having them here. At least they’re visitors.
FRANK
I’m sorry but I have to direct
you to my attorney Mr. Ragano if
you want to talk about Mr. Hoffa or any other matter for that
matter. I got nothing new to say.
He’s dead.
Who’s dead?

FBI AGENT
FRANK

FBI AGENT
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

138

He’s dead?
Cancer.

FRANK
Who did it?
FBI AGENT

Frank didn’t know.
FBI AGENT
Everybody’s dead, Mr. Sheeran.
Russell, Angelo, Salerno, Pro,
Dorfman, Sal Briguglio. But Mr.
Hoffa’s children aren’t dead.
They live with not knowing, and
that’s hard to do. You have
children. You know. It’s time to
say what happened.
Frank actually seems like he might be thinking about
telling them. But then FRANK
You seem like nice fellas. And
I appreciate you coming to see me.
But I can’t help you.
INT. CHAPEL - ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000
Frank sits in his wheelchair in the chapel of the
assisted living facility, a few faded snapshots in his
lap.
He slowly runs a hand through his hair as he looks at a
snapshot of himself with Russell. Eventually - we see
that there’s a young priest with him.
PRIEST
Do you still remember the Hail
Mary and Our Father?
FRANK
Say it. See if I do.
PRIEST
Try it.
(Frank hesitates)
Should I say it?
FRANK
You say it then (I’ll follow) -

139
PRIEST
Well if you say it, I’ll know
whether you remember.
FRANK
I go so far - “Hail Mary full of
grace, Our Lord is with thee PRIEST
(prompting)
Blessed art thou FRANK
- amongst women -- That’s about as
far as I go.
PRIEST
You want me to say it?
FRANK
Yeah, why don’t you.
PRIEST
Hail Mary, full of grace. / The
Lord is with thee / Blessed art
thou among women / And blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus Frank joins in the prayer, saying it along with the
Priest.
FRANK AND PRIEST
- Holy Mary, Mother of God / Pray
for us sinners / Now and at the
hour of our death. Amen.
FRANK
Well, I say what I know - forgive
me for not knowing the other half.
The intention is there.
Silence.
PRIEST
You feel nothing for what you did (the killings)? [Contrition talk]
No.

FRANK

PRIEST
You don’t feel anything?

140
FRANK
I know you’re supposed to feel
something. But I guess the fact
that I’m here talking to you that’s something... I guess. It’s
a different world where I’m from.
There are things you have to do.
That’s the life you’re in. You
give your word. You do the wrong
thing you gotta pay - You don’t
know...
PRIEST
So you don’t feel anything?
FRANK
No, they deserved it.
PRIEST
You feel no remorse.
FRANK
Water under the dam.
PRIEST
Nothing for their families.
FRANK
I didn’t know their families.
Except one...
Silence as Frank regards the photo that’s now on top in
his hands: One of Jimmy and Frank taken at Frank Sheeran
Appreciation Night.
FRANK (CONT’D)
Did I have any choice?
PRIEST
If you had a choice, would you
have done the same thing?
FRANK
Let’s put it this way, if I didn’t
do it, nothing was gonna change.
They would’ve done it anyway. And
then done it to me, too... What
kind of man makes a phone call
like that?
PRIEST
What do you mean?

141
FRANK
That’s all I can tell ya.
It kills Frank to keep looking at the photograph of
Jimmy, but he forces himself to for several more moments.
Nothing can dull the guilt he feels for what he did to
Jimmy, and as the priest studies him, he thinks he sees
something in Frank that was hidden before. Not just
remorse, but some faint remnant of humanity.
PRIEST
Would you like to pray now?
Yes.

FRANK

PRIEST
God we come before you sinful and
sorrowful, aware of what we have
done and what we have failed to
do. We ask you to help us see
ourselves for who we are, just as
you do, and we ask your
forgiveness for anything that we
might have done wrong, because we
know that you are all good and all
loving, and love us even when we
fail.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - ANOTHER DAY - 2000
Frank sits in his wheelchair in his room, hooked up to a
trolley IV, a few faded snapshots in his lap. A young
nurse opens the door and comes in to check the IV and
take his vitals. As she does it FRANK
This is my daughter Peggy.
It’s the snapshot of Peggy and Jimmy at the miniature
golf course. The nurse gives it a perfunctory glance.
Is it.

NURSE

Frank nods to himself.
NURSE (CONT’D)
I don’t think I’ve met her yet.
FRANK
She hasn’t been around much.

142
The nurse cuffs his arm to check his blood pressure.
And, just making conversation, like she does with all
patients NURSE
She’s your only child?
FRANK
I have four daughters.
Really.

NURSE

Frank nods. None of them have been around much. She
glances down at the photo again.
NURSE (CONT’D)
Who’s that with her?
Who’s that?
know?

FRANK
You really don’t

She takes a closer look at the picture.
FRANK (CONT’D)
That’s Jimmy Hoffa.
Oh...

NURSE

She clearly doesn’t know who that is. Frank doesn’t
bother telling her. She puts her fingers to his wrist to
check his pulse rate. He looks at the next snapshot:
Jimmy and himself at Appreciation Night.
FRANK
You only know how fast time goes
when you get there.
She’s used to old people saying things that make no
sense, and says as much Uh-huh.

NURSE

He looks at her two fingers touching his wrist like a
hand of benediction.
FRANK
Did I have any choice?
She gives him the kind of ‘shhh’ you give your kid to
comfort their crying. But it’s not that.

143
NURSE
I’m trying to take your pulse,
Mr. Sheeran, please don’t talk.
Silence as she counts his heartbeats... then takes her
hand away and writes it down.
Okay.

NURSE (CONT’D)
You’re free.

He looks at her.
NURSE (CONT’D)
Until later today (when I put you
through all this again).
I’m here.

FRANK

The nurse smiles and we follow her as she heads out into
the corridor.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING CORRIDOR / ROOM - DAY TO NIGHT
We follow action in the corridor as we begin to hear the
priest giving absolution.
Day changes to night.
From out in the corridor we’re only allowed a partial
view into Frank’s room, and even that is intermittently
obscured by nurses in white coming past.
It’s as if what’s going on in there is too sacred to
intrude on, the priest’s hands extending over Frank’s
head, giving him absolution, the words only sometimes
audible over the routine hospital sounds.
PRIEST
...through the ministry of the
Church may God give you pardon and
peace, I absolve you from your
sins in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and the Holy
Spirit.
Amen.

FRANK

INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - FRANK’S ROOM - NIGHT
We find our way back into Frank’s room.

144
PRIEST
Give thanks to the Lord, for He is
good....
Frank doesn’t remember the prayer. The priest prompts
him.
His mercy -

PRIEST (CONT’D)

FRANK
His mercy endures forever.
PRIEST
May He bring you safely to His
kingdom in Heaven. Amen.
FRANK

Amen.

The priest readies to leave.
PRIEST
I can come see you again if you
want, after the Christmas
holidays.
FRANK
It’s Christmas?
Almost.
Okay.

PRIEST

FRANK
I ain’t going nowhere.

The priest heads out.
FRANK (CONT’D)
Father, could you do me a favor?
Don’t close the door all the way.
I don’t like that. Leave it open a
little.
Sure.

PRIEST

From outside the room, the door starts to close, but then
stops just short of covering up our view of Frank in the
room.

145
As the priest’s footsteps echo in the hospital corridor,
we can just make Frank out in the sliver of light between
the edge of the door and frame - alone in his wheelchair
with the little stack of photographs in his lap, slowly
leafing through them.
