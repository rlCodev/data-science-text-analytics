This play can be played without any age restriction. It will
work if the chemistry between all the characters makes sense.
Human behavior and betrayal applies to all of us. It exists
within ourselves. You love somebody. Do you? What is love?
You think you have everything, but you don't have anything.
You have to have hope and spirit. Be an optimist. But can you
handle all your human behavior or other's behavior? You don't
want to be good, but great.

ACT I
SCENE 1
YOU CAN SEE THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SUNRISE BEHIND THE BAY.
THEN AN EXTERNAL SHOT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING SOUTH OF
MARKET STREET. THERE IS A SHOT OF A WINDOW OF THE ROOM. IT IS
FURNISHED SIMPLY.
AS WE PAN ACROSS THE ROOM WE SEE A MAN AND A WOMAN ASLEEP AND
PARTIALLY NAKED. THE ALARM CLOCK RINGS. THE MAN REACHES TO
THE CLOCK AND TURNS IT OFF. HE SLEEPILY AROUSES AND PUTS ON
HIS SHORTS AND WALKS SLOWLY TO THE BATHROOM. HE CLOSES THE
DOOR. PAN BACK TO THE WOMAN WAKING UP. THE MAN COMES OUT OF
THE BATHROOM AND SMILES TENDERLY AT HER.

I am not a slave here, am I?
JOHNNY
Did you like last night?
LISA
Yes, I did.
(PAUSE)
What time do you have to be there?
JOHNNY
(HE PULLS A SUIT FROM THE CLOSET AND THROWS IT ON THE BED
AND STARTS DRESSING.)
JOHNNY
Where is my coffee?
LISA
(SHE GETS OUT OF BED AND PUTS ON A REVEALING GOWN AND GOES TO
THE KITCHEN.)
What time do you have to be there?
JOHNNY
(HE IS YELLING.)
I told you many times! 9:30! I have my promotion to think
about.
LISA
Promotion! Promotion! That's all I hear about. Here is your
coffee and English muffin and burn your mouth.
JOHNNY
(HE SITS DOWN AT THE TABLE DRINKING AND EATING.)
Old man Donkey lets me know today. I have to think about our
future.

LISA
Well at least I don't have a promotion to think about.
JOHNNY
You have too much competition in the computer field.
LISA
I can handle it. You worry about yourself.
JOHNNY
You sound like we have separate lives. We will be married
next month Lisa.
LISA
Yeah.... Yeah.... Well.
JOHNNY
(HE STANDS UP.)
Thank you for breakfast.
(HE KISSES HER ON THE CHEEK AND LEAVES.)
See you later.
LISA
(LISA WALKS TO THE PHONE AND DIALS A NUMBER.)
Hi mom. How are you doing?
CLAUDETTE
(CLAUDETTE IS TALKING ON THE OTHER PHONE.)
I'm fine. What's happening with you?
LISA
Nothing much.
CLAUDETTE
What's wrong? Tell me.

CLAUDETTE
Why not?

I don't think I want to get married.
CLAUDETTE
(CLAUDETTE RAISES HER VOICE.)
Why not?
LISA
I don't love him anymore.
CLAUDETTE
Why not? Tell me why.
LISA
He's boring.
CLAUDETTE
Well you've known him for over five years. You're engaged!
You said you loved him. You should reconsider. He supports
you, he provides for you, and you can't support yourself. He
is a good guy and he loves you very much. His income is very
secure and he told me he wants to buy you a home.
LISA
That's why he's boring.
CLAUDETTE
What are you going to do?
LISA
Um, I don't know. I don't mind living with him.

CLAUDETTE
You can't do that. Did you tell Johnny about it?
LISA
No. I don't know what to do.
CLAUDETTE
He's a very nice person and you know he's getting a promotion
soon. He bought you a car, a ring, clothes, whatever you like
and now you want to dump him. It's not right. I've always
thought of him as my son in law. You should marry him. He
would be good for you.
LISA
Oh, I guess you're right about that, mom.
CLAUDETTE
Of course I'm right my dear, I know about men. I was not born
yesterday. I'm glad you listen to your mother. Nobody else
listens to me. I work so hard and nobody appreciates it. I
try to tell them what they should do, but they don't listen.
LISA
I guess I'll try. See you later, mom.
CLAUDETTE
Okay. Take care of yourself, Lisa. Bye.
LISA
Bye mom.

Hey baby, how are you doing?
MARK
Oh hi, I'm very busy. How are you doing?
LISA
I just finished talking to my mother and she just finished
giving me this big lecture about how big and great Johnny is.
MARK
We'll talk about it later. As I already told you I'm very
busy.
LISA
Busy doing what? We'll talk about it now. Whenever you say
we'll talk about it later, we never do. I can't wait till
later, we have to talk right now. You owe me one anyway.
Remember when Johnny saved your life? Remember it was all
because of me telling him to do it?
MARK
Okay you win. What do you want to talk about?
LISA
She is a stupid, fucking bitch. She wants to control my life.
I will not put up with that anymore. She's not the boss of
me, and nobody's going to tell ME what to do! I'm going to do
whatever I want and that's it! What do you think I should do?
I need your advice.
MARK
Why do you ask me? I mean you've been very happy with Johnny.
What do you want me to say? You should enjoy life. What's the
problem?
LISA
Maybe you're right. Can I see you for coffee tomorrow?

Did you get your promotion, honey?
(SHE TAKES THE FLOWERS TO THE KITCHEN, UNWRAPS THEM AND
SHOVES THEM IN A VASE. JOHNNY LIES DOWN ON THE COUCH. SHE
BRINGS THE FLOWERS TO THE ROOM AND PLACES THEM ON THE COFFEE
TABLE.)
You didn't get it did you.
JOHNNY
That son of a bitch told me I will get within three months.
It's not right. I save them bundles, they are crazy. I don't
think I will ever get it. They trick me, they didn't keep
their promise, they betray me, and I don't care anymore.
LISA
(LISA IS SITTING IN THE CHAIR NEXT TO THE COUCH.)
Did you tell them how much you saved them?
JOHNNY
Of course I did. What do you think? They already put my ideas
into practice. Already the bank saves tons of money. They
should be grateful to have someone like me who is so good at
doing the things I do there. Instead old man Donkey is using
me and I'm the fool.
LISA
I still love you.
JOHNNY
You're the only one who does.

dozen of my old clients and they don't need me.

Do you want me to order a pizza or something?
JOHNNY
Whatever I don't care.
LISA
What kind of topping do you want?
JOHNNY
I don't care.
LISA
Are you alright? What is the matter? It's just a lousy
promotion.
(SHE ORDERS PIZZA.)
I'll fix a cup of chocolate. That will make you feel better.

HOLD THE DRINK IN HIS HAND.)
If you love me, you will drink this, my darling.

You are not drinking your cognac, dear. It will taste good
with the pizza.
JOHNNY
(HE TAKES A SMALL SIP AND EATS PIZZA.)
You're right, it's good.

JOHNNY

I don't have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me.

Next Friday at six. It's a surprise. You can bring someone if
you want.

Well, sure, I can come, but I don't know if I'll bring
anybody. Oh that jerk Harold, he wants me to give him a share
of my house. That house belongs to me, he has no right. I'm
not giving him a penny. Who does he think he is?
LISA
He's your brother.
CLAUDETTE
He is always bugging me about my house. Fifteen years ago we
agreed that house belongs to me. Now the value of the house
is going up and he's seeing dollar signs. Everything goes
wrong at once. Nobody wants to help me and I'm dying.
LISA
We already discussed this. You're not dying mom.

CLAUDETTE
I am Lisa. I finally got the results of the test back. I
definitely have breast cancer.
LISA
Look, don't worry about it, everything will be fine. They are
curing lots of people everyday and Johnny says it's not a big
deal anymore.
CLAUDETTE
I'm sure he's right. I'll be fine. Oh I heard Edward is
talking about me. He is a hateful man. I'm so glad I divorced
him. I really think he gave me the breast cancer after he
slept with that hooker. That type of riffraff carry all sorts
of things. Don't you agree?
LISA
Look, don't worry about it. You just concentrate on getting
well.
CLAUDETTE
Well at least you have a good man.
LISA
You're wrong, mom. He's not what you think he is. He didn't
get his promotion, and he got drunk last night and he hit me.
CLAUDETTE
Johhny doesn't drink. What are you talking about?
LISA
He did last night, and I don't love him anymore.
CLAUDETTE
Johnny is your financial security. You can't afford to ignore
this.
LISA
Yeah, ok mom. Can I just talk to you later?

I don't know. A couple of hours at least.
MICHELLE

those ingredients for!?
BILLY
I'll come back later.
(BILLY EXITS THE FLAT. LISA GOES OVER AND SITS DOWN NEXT TO
HER MOTHER.)
CLAUDETTE
Tell me, what does Billy do for money? You're not lending him
any I hope.
LISA
Johnny wanted to adopt Billy after you disowned him. It's
really a tragedy how many kids out there don't have a great
friend like Johnny. When Billy turned eighteen, Johnny found
him a little apartment here in this building and he is paying
for it until he graduates from school. Johnny is very caring
about the people in his life, and he gave Billy his own set
of keys to our place. Billy has a thing for Johnny, but I
don't like it, so we try to discourage it.
CLAUDETTE
That boy has been nothing but trouble. First the cesarean and
now this. It's time Billy grew up and took care of himself.
LISA
Johnny really cares about Billy, but Billy is so annoying.
That's another reason why I don't love Johnny anymore.

you really don't love Johnny so be it, but you should wait
till after you're married before you tell him. That way he
has to split his assets with you 50/50 if he wants a divorce.
BRAN
(BRAN COMES RUSHING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND RIGHT TO THE
COUCH. HE REACHES UNDER THE SEAT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.)
I forgot my book.
(BRAN GRABS HIS UNDERWEAR AND CLAUDETTE GRABS IT FROM HIM.)
CLAUDETTE
Some book! What's it called, "The Week Bran Forgot To Change
His Underwear"?
BRAN
Oh, that's nothing.
(BRAN GRABS HIS UNDERWEAR BACK AND STORMS OUT, CLOSING THE
DOOR. LISA AND CLAUDETTE CACKLE HYSTERICALLY.)
CLAUDETTE
Homework?
LISA
Don't worry about it.
CLAUDETTE
If I were a burglar, you would be my best friend.

Do you know who I am? I have 9 black belts, 15 Master's
degrees and a PhD in Agricultural Economics. That's right,
you know I'm way better than you, and all my friends will
gladly tell you just how great and awesome I am! Have you
seen my power level? It's over 9,000! You know what that
means? It means I have more than 9,000 units of POWER. It
also puts my total adjusted force rating at 22,000! That's
more than triple, so you don't want to make me mad, because
anger is my middle name!

Why Lisa! Why Lisa! Why don't you talk to me! Come on Lisa!
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Talk to me please! Without you I would be
nothing. You are my life, my everything, I could not go on
without you Lisa.
LISA
You're scaring me.
(LISA STANDS UP AS IF TO HEAD UPSTAIRS. JOHNNY STANDS IN HER
FACE.)
JOHNNY
You are lying! I never hit you. You are taking me apart,
Lisa!!!!!
LISA
Why are you so hysterical!?
JOHNNY
(HE TAKES HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND SHAKES HER.)
Do you understand life? Do you understand life? Do you?
LISA
(LISA GETS UP AND WALKS UP THE STAIRS.)
Don't worry about it. Everything will be alright.
(SHE IS KISSING JOHNNY ON THE CHEEK AND GOES INTO THE
BATHROOM.)
JOHNNY
You drive me crazy!
(HE IS SITTING ON A CHAIR AND THINKING. HIS FACE LOOKS VERY
WORRIED.)

LISA
You look really tired today mom, are you feeling okay?
CLAUDETTE
I didn't get much sleep last night.
LISA
Why not? What's wrong?
(LISA TOUCHES CLAUDETTE ON THE SHOULDER.)
CLAUDETTE
You remember my friend Shirley Hamilton? She wants to buy a
new house and I asked Johnny if he could help her with the
down payment. All he can tell me is that it's an awkward
situation. I expected your husband to be a little more
generous.
LISA
He's not my husband.
CLAUDETTE
I know, but Johnny is part of our family.

You can't be serious.

CONVERSATION BETWEEN CLAUDETTE AND LISA.)
LISA
You don't understand.
CLAUDETTE
Who, who is it?
LISA
I don't want to talk about it.
CLAUDETTE
Oh no! It's that homework character with the underwear, isn't
it! I gave you strict orders not to sleep with that goofball.
Well, that's it. You leave me no other option than to disown
y...
LISA
(LISA STARTS TALKING AND CUTS OFF CLAUDETTE BEFORE SHE CAN
FINISH.)
It's not Bran! Look, I just don't want to talk about it.
CLAUDETTE
You don't want to talk about it. Then why did you bring it up
in the first place? Have you lost your mind? Next thing
you'll be turning tricks like your brother.
LISA
I don't know why I brought it up?

You don't know? You really are going crazy.
(CLAUDETTE POINTS THE FINGER AT LISA.)
I have to go pick up my breast cancer medicine. Can you
believe it's going to cost me $ 120.00? I think the whole
thing was made up just so they can make some easy money.
Imagine, taking advantage of an old defenseless lady who's
losing her life.
LISA
Mom, just take the medicine and you'll be fine. Are you
coming to the party?
CLAUDETTE
Sure, I suppose so.
(CLAUDETTE WALKS TO THE DOOR. SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND LISA AND
CLAUDETTE EXIT. JOHNNY IS STILL BEHIND THE STAIRCASE. HE IS
IN SHOCK.)
JOHNNY
How can they say this about me? I don't believe it. Lisa has
been unfaithful and that woman, her mother, cares more about
her "life threatening" cancer than she does about me.
(HE MAKES QUOTATION SIGNS WITH HIS FINGERS AS HE SAYS "LIFE
THREATENING".)
I'll show them, I'll record everything.
(JOHNNY WALKS DOWN THE STAIRCASE AND OVER TO THE TABLE WHERE
THE PHONE IS AND SITS DOWN. HE PULLS OUT A TAPE AND PLACES IT
INTO THE TAPE RECORDER, HE INSTALLS THE RECORDING DEVICE INTO
THE PHONE AND HIDES IT UNDER THE TABLE. JOHNNY THEN WALKS

BRAN
Actually Johnny, I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands.
JOHNNY
Did Michelle betray you or something?
BRAN
No, nothing horrible like that! I'd probably kill myself if
she ever did that.
JOHNNY
Who wouldn't? So tell me what happened.
BRAN
Me and Michelle were making out, at your place.
JOHNNY
Uh huh.
BRAN
And Lisa and Claudette sort of walked in on us in the middle
of it. That's not the end of the story.
JOHNNY
Go on, I'm listening.
BRAN
We're going at it and I get out of there as fast as possible.
I get my pants, I get my shirt, and I get out of there. And
then about half way down the stairs, I realize that I had
misplaced, I had forgotten something....my underwear.

Claudette, she saw it sticking out of my pocket, and she
pulls it out and she's showing everybody me underwears.

SCENE 14
JOHNNY IS SITTING NEXT TO THE PHONE. HE LOOKS AROUND TO CHECK
THAT NO ONE IS AROUND THEN PULLS OUT THE TAPE RECORDER FROM
UNDER THE TABLE. HE PRESSES SOME BUTTONS ON THE ANSWERING
MACHINE AND MUFFLED VOICES ARE HEARD AS THE TAPE PLAYS.
JOHNNY IS SHAKING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING VERY DISTURBED. HE
SUDDENLY TAKES OUT THE TAPE AND HURLES IT ACROSS THE ROOM AS
HE SCREAMS.
THERE IS A RING OF THE DOORBELL AND JOHNNY WALKS OVER AND
OPENS THE DOOR. PETER, AN INTELLECTUAL AND A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO
WEARS GLASSES IS AT THE DOOR. JOHNNY INVITES HIM IN.
JOHNNY
Oh hi Peter, I'm so glad you stopped by. Come in and have a
seat, I'll get some water for us to drink.
(PETER SITS DOWN ON THE COUCH AND JOHNNY GOES TO THE KITCHEN
AND COMES BACK WITH TWO GLASSES AND A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH
HE POURS FOR BOTH OF THEM. JOHNNY SITS DOWN.)
I don't understand women. Do you Peter?
PETER
Of course I do. I'm a psychologist. What's the problem?
JOHNNY
They never say what they mean, and they always play games.
(JOHNNY HANDS PETER A GLASS OF WATER.)
PETER
Okay, what do you mean?
JOHNNY
I have a serious problem with Lisa. I don't think she's being
faithful to me. In fact, I know she isn't.
PETER
Lisa? Are you sure?

JOHNNY
I'm sure. I overheard a conversation between Lisa and her
mother, and I recorded some phone conversations she had with
a guy who has a voice that coincidentally sounds very similar
to the voice of Mark, who is my best friend. What should I do
Peter?
PETER
This is Lisa we are talking about?
JOHNNY
Yeah.
PETER
Are you sure?
JOHNNY
Yes.
PETER
What would you like me to say?
JOHNNY
You are a psychologist, Peter. Don't you have some advice?
PETER
(PETER IS STANDING AND DRINKING WATER.)
I am an expert, that's true, and it's not a very complicated
situation. But Johnny, you are my friend and I don't want to
get between you and Lisa. Look, I think you should confront
her and show her who's the man of the house.
JOHNNY
I can't confront her, I have to give her a second chance.
After all she's my future wife. You know what they say, love
is blind.

PETER
It's not about love, Johnny. It's about control, and the best
way to control a female is to make them emotionally dependent
on you. You didn't do that, so Lisa found it somewhere else.
(THE DOORBELL RINGS.)
Did you hear the door?
JOHNNY
Yeah.

Oh hi Mark, come in.
MARK
(MARK ENTERS WITH A BIG SMILE.)
Oh hey Johnny. Hey Peter.
JOHNNY
We are just talking about women.
MARK
(MARK CLOSES THE DOOR AND WALKS OVER TO THE CHAIR.)
Women, man, women just confuse me. Can't live with them,
can't live without them, but we need them for baby making.
(MARK SITS DOWN ON THE CHAIR.)
I have a girl, but she's married. She's very attractive. It's
driving me crazy.
PETER
Why didn't you mention this before? I'm a psychologist. Is it
anyone I know?

JOHNNY
Oh I see. You mean she's too old or you think I will take her
away from you? Huh?
(JOHNNY AND PETER LAUGH.)
MARK
No!
JOHNNY
I have my own problems.
PETER
Tell me about your problems Johnny.
JOHNNY
Peter, you always play psychologist with us.
PETER
Look, I may be your friend, but by profession I am a
psychologist, and that makes me an expert on these issues.
JOHNNY
Lisa is teasing me about whether we will get married or not,
and we haven't made love in awhile. I don't know what to do.
PETER
What kind of man are you Johnny? People are people. Sometimes
they can't see their own faults, so they need someone to tell
them. You have to give it to her straight. It takes two to
tango Johnny, and if all she has are two left feet she'll
just end up stepping all over your toes. You're going to get
hurt.

You guys proved my point. You are both weird. You guys want
to play cards?
JOHNNY
No, we can't. I expect Lisa any minute.
MARK
Hey, who's king of the house?
PETER
Yeah, you have to establish these guidelines before you get
married. How did you meet Lisa? you never told us.
JOHNNY
It's a very interesting story. When I moved to San Francisco
I had two suitcases and I didn't know anyone. I hit the YMCA
with a two thousand dollar check that I couldn't cash.
MARK
Why not?
JOHNNY
Because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, I was working as
a bus boy in a hotel and Lisa was sitting, drinking her
coffee and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. That's
how we met.
MARK
So, what's the interesting part?

Oh give us a break Mark! Isn't it obvious? A two thousand

Ha Ha! That's quite the conundrum. I'll bet it's never been
cashed, has it.
JOHNNY
You're right Peter, on both counts. I had the uncashed check
laminated and placed in a photo album, which is indeed very
interesting. But, even more interesting is that Lisa was
living in San Francisco at the time.
MARK
So?
(JOHNNY TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND PETER LOOKS AT THE FLOOR.)
JOHNNY
Don't you see, Mark? Lisa had her own home in the city. She
did not need to stay in a hotel. She had some kind of
inexplicable urge to spend the night in that very hotel,
during my shift. It was meant to be!
MARK
What, no tips from your job?

PETER
How did this happen? If Johnny finds out that will be the end
of your friendship. What were you thinking? Look, life is
very complex, but you have to face it. You should have to be
responsible. My advice to you is that you should stop
thinking about her, and never do sex with her. Find another
girl. That's my advice. Lisa's a sociopath. She only cares

No, I mean what happened at the police station. Didn't you

A LONG BOMB.)
Go, go...
(PETER RUNS DEEP AND FALLS FLAT ON HIS FACE. HIS LEG IS HURT.
MARK, BILLY, AND JOHNNY RUSH OVER TO SEE IF HE'S OKAY.)
BILLY
Gee Mark, why don't you try NOT hurting someone for a change.
PETER
It's not his fault. It's those damn drugs!
JOHNNY
Come on, let's go see a doctor.
(MARK, JOHNNY, AND BILLY HELP PETER GET UP AND THEY ALL WALK
OFF TOGETHER.)

SCENE 18
JOHNNY IS IN THE KITCHEN GETTING READY FOR WORK, AND LISA IS
STILL ASLEEP. HE FINISHES HIS BREAKFAST, THEN HE GOES OVER TO
THE ANSWERING MACHINE AND PRESSES A FEW BUTTONS. THE TAPE
RECORDER STARTS PLAYING AND MUFFLED VOICES ARE HEARD. JOHNNY
LOOKS VERY ANGRY. HE PRESSES SOME MORE BUTTONS THEN REGAINS
HIS COMPOSURE.
JOHNNY
(JOHNNY GOES OVER TO LISA AND KISSES HER ON THE CHEEK.)
Bye Lisa.

Hello mom. How are you?
CLAUDETTE
I'm okay. How are you?
LISA
There it us again.
CLAUDETTE
What are you talking about?
LISA
That clicking noise. The phone's been making a strange sound
lately.
CLAUDETTE
You should report it to the phone company. Utilities are very
expensive these days. Did you call a repair technician?
LISA
No, I think I'll just by a new phone. There's a Radio­Shack
nearby.
CLAUDETTE
Well, as long as Johnny's paying for it. So, how are you?
LISA
I'm fixing the apartment for Johnny's birthday, but I'm
really not into it.
CLAUDETTE
Why not?

LISA
Oh, I don't want to get married. I love Mark. Don't you
understand that?
CLAUDETTE
It's not right Lisa. You should still keep Johnny because
he's very independent, and you ain't. Think about the money.
LISA
Yeah, but I'm not happy anymore. Before I met Mark I didn't
think he would blow my mind.
CLAUDETTE
What are you talking about? You weren't meant to be happy. I
haven't been happy since I got married for the first time. I
didn't want to marry your dad either. I've been miserable
since then. It's true, men are all assholes. You have to use
them and abuse them. There's nothing wrong with that.
LISA
I know. Johnny's okay, and I have him wrapped around my
little finger.
CLAUDETTE
Well, then you should be happy.
LISA
But, I don't love him.
CLAUDETTE
Don't throw your life away just because you don't love him.
That's ridiculous. You've got to grow up and listen to me.
LISA
Okay, I'll see you at the party then.
CLAUDETTE
Bye.

Hi, can I have a hot chocolate please?

Oh hi Johnny! I didn’t know it was you. What size would you

Excuse me? 'MY' stupid comments!? Here's some words of wisdom
for YOU, you comment making idiot. You think your opinions
are so important and that you possess some natural­born
expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say
that your comments are even more stupider than you, the very
person making them. Now, I have a lot of experience, so when
I say something, it counts. That's because I'm very important
and I know what I'm talking about, unlike feeble­minded you.
I see you want to make a retort with a comment, do you?

MICHELLE
Me too. There's no simple solution to this.
LISA
Don't worry. You guys worry entirely too much about me.
MICHELLE
Lisa, we're not worried about you, we are worried about
Johnny. You don't understand the psychological impact of what
you are doing here. You're hurting yourself, you are hurting
OUR friendship.
PETER
Actually it's more like a thermonuclear bomb I'm sitting on,
using the primary fission reaction from the atomic bomb I was
previously sitting on to compress and ignite a secondary
hydrogen based fusion reaction.
LISA
I am not responsible for Johnny. I'm through with that. I'm

Hey Peter, What's the difference between a psychologist and a

One's a quack, the other's a duck.
JOHNNY
The fight's over folks, everything's fine.
