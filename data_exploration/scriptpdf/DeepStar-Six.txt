EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY
Light blue sky fills the screen.
The CAMERA PANS lower revealing some thin clouds.
Finally the CAMERA SPLASHES below the surface of
the water and continues to descend.
Hund.reds of bubbles rise past as the camera swims
lazily through azure seas sparkling with sunlight
and teeming with brightly colored tropical fish.
The bubbles swirl past as we dive down, the water
turning paler, the fish becoming duller and more
scarce.
A large shark swims past us, on the prowl.
Deeper and deeper we dive.
Soon the water is black as night. Only the
faintest slivers of light penetrate down here, and
then quickly flicker and die.
Large shadowy creatures _of the ultra-deep haunt the
edges of our vision.
Strange luminescent fish with long poin~y teeth
dart past.
The sea bottom draws near, a flat plain scarred by
an enormous impact crater, miles in diameter. WE
glide over the outer wall, the crater floor looms
beneath us.
On the bottom, a faint light glimmers.
It is an undersea station, a series of five
cylinders linked by a central hub.
It looks like a
giant starfish resting quietly on the ocean floor.
Several hundred yards beyond the station, the faint
lights of the bio-lab can be seen. This is where
all the genetics research is done.

INT. GALLEY
Breakfast.
Nine people are seated in the galley.
Nobody is talking, only the sound of CLANKING
dishware.
DR. ABERNATHY glances across at DR. JERKINS.
Jerkins is late fourties, high strung. His eyes
are a little red and a little swollen. He has the
appearance of someone who is not sleeping well at
night.
Abernathy takes out a small harmonica from his
breast pocket.
Jerkins freezes in mid-bite at the sight of the
harmonica.
Abernathy takes his hankerchief, polishing the
harmonica. He taps it i~ his palm, breaking the
reeds free.
Abernathy puts the harmonica to his lips and and is
about to blow ...
Jerkins starts to say something ...

DREW PIERCE takes a seat at the other end of the
table with three of his fellow ·"support group",
JAMES RICHARDSON (Diver), TONY SNYDER
(Communications), and JOYCE COLLINS (Diver). There
is already a plate of food at his place.
PIERCE
Good morning, campers.
(looking down at his
plate)
I thought we were out of oatmeal.
COLLINS
That's eggs ...
Pierce gingerly shoves them around on his plate,
then looks up at Richardson, who is reading a fax
letter written in a childish scrawl.
PIERCE
What have you got there, Ace?
RICHARDSON
Letter from Julie.
COLLINS
Check it out .••
Collins holds up a fax of a picture drawn in crayon
-- it's a stick figure man in a dive suit adjacent
to a house under the water. All around are
brightly colored trees, flowers and fish.
The
caption at the top reads: MY DADDY AT WORK
Pierce leans over to get a -look.
PIERCE
Hey, that's pretty good ...
RICHARDSON
Well, it ain't Rembrandt, pal .•. but to
me it's priceless.

COLLINS
Isn't that sweet?
RICHARDSON
I told her it was beautiful down here.
With flowers and trees •••
Snyder starts laughing, his mouth gorged with food.
SNYDER
Whata buncha shit •..
COLLINS
Must be nice to have a family waiting
for you ...
This is a conversation they've had a thousand
times, only this time Pierce gives Collins a
strange look.
RICHARDSON
After six months, it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

·-·

PIERCE
I could go another six months .•. as long
as they keep laying on that "extra-duty
pay".
COLLINS
Come on, admit it, Pierce. Wouldn't
you like to have a rug-rat of your own
waiting for you when you go topside?
But Pierce is busy looking at his watch.
PIERCE
Better get the eggheads to work.
(standing up, calling to
the other end of the
table)
Let's go! The bus for the fish factory
leaves in five minutes!
Valdez, Craven, Abernathy, and Jerkins get up,
shuffling towards the hatch. Collins and
Richardson also rise.
Snyder grabs Richardson's arm as he starts to
leave.

DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT

SNYDER
(almost whispering)
Did ya get them?
RICHARDSON
Yeah, I got 'em. You gonna fax my
letter to Julie this morning?
You bet.

SNYDER
First thing.

Richardson glances around the galley to make sure
no one is watching, then digs into his pocket. He
palms Snyder a small bottle of pills.
PIERCE
If Norris finds out where you got
these, you're dead meat, pal.
SNYDER
She won't ... thanks, man.

I owe you

RICHARDSON
(somewhat disgusted)
Yeah, yeah.
SNYDER
Hey, I just use them to help me to
sleep, you know? Christ, what do you
think I am? A fucking junkie?
He gives Snyder a scrutinzing stare, then exits the
galley. As soon as he is gone, Snyder opens the
bottle and pops two of the pills.
SNYDER
(continuing - to
himself)
Asshole.

INT. DOCKING BAY
As Pierce leads the others into the DSRV, he
Pierce starts to sing.
PIERCE
Hi-he, hi-he! It's off to work we go!
Come on, eggheads ... sing along!

DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT

The scientists start to sing, half-heartedly along
with Pierce.
PIERCE/OTHERS
Hi-ho, hi-ho!
It's off to work we go!
(some funny verse in
here)
The scientists start to file into the minisub.
Laidlaw stands by the airlock, shrugging into his
"woolies" -- insulated coveralls. Norris walks up
behind him.
NORRIS
Can I have a word with you, Captain?
LAIDLAW
Can it wait until I get back from the
lab?
NORRIS
It'll only take a minute.
Laidlaw sighs, nodding his head.

INT. MEDICAL BAY
Norris enters the medical bay followed by Laidlaw,
she closes the hatch after he is in.
NORRIS
Have you made a decision about rotation
yet?

Laidlaw leans against the bulkhead, sipping his
coffee.
LAIDLAW
No. V~ldez says they're on the verge
of a major breakthrough. He just needs
a few more days ...
NORRIS
Valdez has been saying that for weeks
now. He's part of the problem ••• he's
pushing too hard.
(then)
I think we should rotate the whole
science team out.

DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
What's another week?
NORRIS
To a veteran like you ••. nothing. But
these men aren't Navy, they're
scientists. They've been trapped in a
can at the bottom of the ocean for more
than six months now. They need a
break.

I don't want to go over your head on
this ..•
LAIDLAW

Look, Doctor ... it's your call .•.
NORRIS
I'm telling you ... I'm worried about
them.
Laidlaw takes a moment to think.

LAIDLAW
Tell you what ... why don't we review
these requests on a case by case basis?
Fine.

NORRIS
Here's a list ...

LAIDLAW
(reading over the list)
Why do you want to transfer Collins?
NORRIS
(simply)
She's pregnant.
LAIDLAW
Does he know?
NORRIS
Of course she knows, she asked me to
run the ...

NORRIS
He's not my friend.

Laidlaw is cut off by the videocom BUZZER. He
crosses to the panel and punches the XMIT switch.

Pierce's face blinks on the tiny monitor.
PIERCE

INT. DOCKING BAY/MAINTENANCE - MOMENTS LATER
Laidlaw enters the hatch to the DSRV.

INT. DSRV
Laidlaw crawls into the mini-sub.
It's very cramped. Pierce is in the pilot's seat
in the conning tower, donning a headset. He starts
flipping switches, humming quietly to himself.
Collins sits directly beneath Pierce, surrounded by
video monitors, sonar equipment, recorders, etc.
To her left is the cluster of forward viewing
ports. They are covered to protect them from
scratching.

DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT

9

In the passenger section in back, Drs. Valdez,
Craven, Abernathy, and Jerkins are already strapped
in.
Laidlaw takes his seat next to Collins, activating
his monitors. Three screens labeled: PORT
FORWARD STARBD flicker to life.
Pierce calls down to Richardson.
PIERCE
Close us up.
Richardson closes the hatch, sealing them in.
Pierce works more controls, we hear a loud WHIRR,
then a metallic THUD.
The DSRV start to sway back and forth as it drifts
free of the Deepstar.
Pierce breaks from his humming into a song.
PIERCE
... so we sailed on to the sun, 'til we
found a sea of green ..•
Oh, God please.

LAIDLAW
Not again.

PIERCE
(starts to sing MUCH
louder)
••. and we lived beneath the waves in a
yellow SUBMARINE!
In back, we can HEAR Abernathy join in on
harmonica.

Laidlaw concentrates on the constantly shifting
sonar display.
LAIDLAW

Pierce backs off on the throttle, the engine
WHINING down as he hits the navigation lights.

Two powerful work lights blaze to life on the
minisub, their beams scattered by suspended
particles in the water.
Ahead, the shadowy form of the Bio-Lab looms up.

Valdez and Craven turn on monitoring equipment
while Collins hits the lights.
Through the glass wall of the control room, the
bio-lab lights flicker on, revealing the vast
experimental laboratory.
Abernathy and Jerkins, zipping up their sterile
suits, step into the "HOT BOX".

The "Hot Box" is the long narrow corridor for
disinfecting persons entering or leaving the bio
lab. At either end there are two small pressure
doors, set high off the deck.
Abernathy and Jerkins move silently through the
"Hot Box". Neither speaks or looks at the other.

Laidlaw and Valdez watch through the control room
window as Abernathy and Jerkins go to work, setting
up the day's experiments.

VALDEZ
Any day now we should have a

LAIDLAW
Norris is putting a lot of pressure on
me to rotate your team out.
VALDEZ
You can't let he~ do that, Captain.
LAIDLAW
She's threatening to go over my head.
VALDEZ
All I need is a few more days.
LAIDLAW
I can't run interference for you much
longer. Let's go, Pierce.
Pierce and Laidlaw head for the docking bay.

INT. BIO LAB - DOCKING BAY
Pierce and Laidlaw are crossing the docking bay,
headed back for the minisub.
LAIDLAW
Look, I don't like butting into other
people's problems ...
PIERCE
Uh, oh.
Is this a Captain/Sailor or
Father/Son talk?
LAIDLAW
More like nosey fuck to dickhead.
Pierce "ahhhs" in recognition.

LAIDLAW
(continuing)
It seems to me that you had something
nice going with Collins and then you
just let it die. Collins is great gal
and she's crazy about you, so I ask
myself "why is Pierce acting like an
asshole?"
Pierce scowls.
PIERCE
It didn't work out .•• so what?

LAIDLAW
Don't you think you owe her an
explaination?
PIERCE
What's there to explain?
LAIDLAW
Drew, I was there when you got married,
I was there when she died, I was there
when you put her in the ground.
I know
how much you loved her, but you can't
let Kathy's death hold up the rest of
your life. You've got to get on
with ...
PIERCE

Okay, you've spoken your piece.

Pierce starts to leave.
LAIDLAW
Want some advice?
PIERCE
No.
LAIDLAW
Tough, here it comes anyway ... give the
thing with Collins another chance.
PIERCE
Is that an order?

DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
No, it's just advice ... good advice.
Just then, Craven enters the docking bay from the
control room.
CRAVEN
Captain, you better come quick ..• it's
Jerkins!

INT. CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Craven, Laidlaw, and Pierce re-enter the control
room. Valdez and Collins watch Jerkins storm
around the bio-lab through the window.
LAIDLAW
Okay John, what's the problem?
VALDEZ
It's Jerkins ... he's trapped Dr.
Abernathy in the dive well and locked
us out of the lab. He says he won't
come out until he gets to talk to you.
LAIDLAW
(to Collins)
Can you get into the lab?
COLLINS
He's pressurized the hatch. We can cut
through it, but i t ' l l take time.
LAIDLAW
Let me talk to him.
Laidlaw presses the intercom button.
Robby.

LAIDLAW
This is Captain Laidlaw.

JERKINS
Captain! I want to go home right now!
If you don't send me home right now I'm
going to flood the airlock and kill
that noisy fat bastard!
LAIDLAW

It helps me relax.
Laidlaw rolls his eyes. He fights to control his
temper in dealing with these "men of science".

LAIDLAW
Dr. Abernathy, I want you to promise
not to play your harmonica in front of
Dr. Jerkins, okay?
ABERNATHY
Yeah, sure.
I just thought he was· a
music lover.
LAIDLAW
Now Dr. Jerkins, how about letting Dr.
Abernathy out of the airlock. He's
promised not to bother you with his
harmonica anymore. Okay?
JERKINS
I want to go_ home. How many times do I
have to tell you?
LAIDLAW
I told you ... we're working on it.
Abernathy rakes his lips across the harmonica,
SCREECHING up and down the scales several times in
quick successsion.
JERKINS

GODDAMMIT! There he goes again!!
I'm
going to KILL that SON OF A BITCH~!!

Abernathy snickers. He knows this makes Jerkins
nuts and delights in it like a schoolboy.
Sorry.

Valdez reaches over and presses the MUTE button on
the intercom. He turns to Laidlaw.
VALDEZ
Captain, we have to get him out of
there before he does something stupid.
If he harms those specimens, we could
lose weeks of hard work.
LAIDLAW
What do you want me to do, John? All I
can do is try to talk him into coming
out.
VALDEZ
Let me talk to him.
Laidlaw thinks about this for a long moment.

Through the window, Jerkins has been shouting and
waving his arms. Suddenly, he throws something at
the window where it bounces off with a loud BONK.

Valdez tries to reason with Jerkins, his voice
BOOMING over the intercom.
VALDEZ
Jerkins, nobody has asked you to
compromise anything here. You're part
of the scientific elite and we're on
the verge of a new age. ·
JERKINS
What a bunch of bul·lshit!
VALDEZ
The life we are creating now will help
mankind tame the underwater frontier.
Just like our forefathers used the ox
and the dog .•.
What?

JERKINS

Jerkins plunges his hand deep into one of the
smaller specimen tanks, pulling out
small,
disgusting-looking sea creature. The thing
~CREECHES loudly, thrashing about in Jerkins' hand.

Jerkins shakes the sea creature at the monitor, it
SCREECHES again as h~s gr~p t~ghtens~
JERKINS

And what about 1138?!! What good is
that thing to anyone?
He gestures to a large cryogenic chamber, frozen
vapor trailing off its side. A large red sign on
the door reads:
DANGER:
HOSTILE LIVE SPECIMEN

VALDEZ
1138 was a mistake, I admit that.
But ...
JERKINS
They're ALL mistakes!
VALDEZ
Mistakes are important steps in the
scientific process ..•
JERKINS
No!! We don't know what we're doing!!!
Can't you see that?!! ARE YOU BLIND?!!
Just at that moment, Dr. Abernathy starts up with a

chorus of "Mary had a little lamb."
Jerkins goes beserk.
JERKINS
(screaming into the
airlock)
GODDAMNIT! ! !
And with that, ~ins heaves the SQUEALING s~a

the escape hatch ·marked:
//LIFE RAFT//LIFE RAFT//LIFE RAFT//
He pulls the arming pins.
Reaching down, he picks up the flare pistol and
tucks it into his waistband.

Pierce shouts down.
Let's go!

PIERCE
Abandon ship!

Collins is trapped under the control panel.
She's trying to wrestle it off, but it won't
budge.

water down the hatch.

Pierce grabs the control panel and heaves.
It
just won't move. The sub heels over the other
way, water pours into the hatch, drenching them.
Water rises up past Collins shoulders, splashing
over her face.
She gulps for air, getting only
ocean.

Pierce is really tired of all of this shit -- he
grabs the goddamn panel and hauls on it.
His fingers slip on the heavy, wet metal.

Pierce looks around at the wreckage, searching
quickly as another big wave comes down the hatch,
totally immersing Collins head.
He finds a piece of pipe, wedges one end under
the panel and jumps on the other end.
The panel lifts a little.
Collins bursts clear, sputtering seawater from
her lungs.
Pierce helps her up to the hatch.
Scrambling out the hatch, Collins trips and
falters.
Pierce puts both hands on her ass and shoves her
out the hatch. Climbing out after her, he
pauses to turn back to the instrument panel.
With his foot, he kicks the FUEL DUMP switch.

EXT. DSRV-1
The fuel is ejected from the minisub with a ROAR,
two geysers of. fuel and seawater shooting up
into the air.
Collins clings to the conning tower.

A growing pool of fuel forms around the sub.
CLOSE ON THE THING - as .it rips free of the remote aJ?l,
leaving a large clump of bloody tissue.
Pierce pushes Collins into the now-inflated life
raft and shoves it off with his foot.
He
remains on the sub.
COLLINS
What are you doing?
PIERCE
Get clear of the sub!
COLLINS
Don't be crazy, come on!
He steadies himself on the rocking sub, grabbing
the flare pistol -- the fuel dump is nearly
complete,
fizzling out. He checks the load.

Suddenly:
COLLINS
BEHIND YOU!
Pierce turns to look -- the thing heaves itself
up the side of the sub towards Pierce. It's
~en mouth a torn, bloody mess.
Pierce takes careful aim on the thing, pulling
the trigger.
CLICK!
Nothing happens.

·-----

The thing gets a clawhold, pulling itself closer.
Pierce's nostrils flare at the stench as he
checks the flare pistol. This time he remembers
to cock it.

The thing HISSES.
PIERCE
Merry Christmas, dickweed!
Pierce FIRES.
The flare shoots right down the thing's mouth.
KA-BOOM!!!
The ocean explodes in a ball of flame.

BACK TO SCENE
Collins grabs the paddle, ready.
WOOOSH!!!
A black figure rockets to the surface.

She screams.

It's Pierce.
Gasping for breath, he tries to pull himself aboard,
but he's so goddamn tired he can barely move.
Collins helps Pierce into the raft, the fuel tanks on
the minisub EXPLODE.
They turn and watch as the sub burns, slipping slowly
beneath the sea.
Then it's gone.
Pierce and Collins lay in the bottom of the raft,
exhausted, not really believing they made it.
After a long, long time, Collins sits up.
COLLINS
Now what do we do?
Pierce sits up with a groan
burned in a couple of places.
He scans the horizon --

he is pretty bad!¥

nothing but water.

Pierce just stares at Collins, her wet and matted
hair, torn underclothes that aren't hiding much.

He smiles, then picks up one of the small plastic
paddles in the bottom of the raft and hands it to
Collins.

PIERCE
Row.
She sighs as she dips the paddle into the water.
Pierce picks up the other paddle and digs in as well.
