1/92

(0100 PRO) PROLOGUE
BLACK
A child’s whispered voice HISSES through the darkness...
CHILD’S VOICE (V.O.)
If you must blink, do it now!
A full moon fills the screen like a giant, unblinking eye.

*

An eerie wind HOWLS through the night sky, and a wave
suddenly rises in front of the moon, eclipsing it from view.

*

Another giant wave swells and we CUT WIDER to reveal-EXT. OCEAN - STORMY NIGHT
A tiny wooden fishing boat comes into view, tossed about by
enormous waves, cresting hundreds of feet high.
That’s when we hear it, weaving throughout the howls of wind.
Hopeful, inexplicable MUSIC. A sweet, chromatic MELODY.

*
*

It is being played by the boat’s lone passenger. A beautiful
Japanese woman with long black hair whipping in the wind. She
kneels as she plays a stringed shamisen instrument.

*
*
*

CHILD’S VOICE (V.O.)
Pay careful attention to everything
you see and hear...No matter how
unusual it may seem.
On the woman’s back we catch a glimpse of a woven bag
embroidered with the image of a beetle.
Before we can get a better look, our attention turns to a
tsunami-sized wave, rising up silently in front of the boat,
threatening to consume everything in its path.
The woman raises her hand, strikes the strings on her
shamisen, and the sea literally parts in front of her,
allowing safe passage clean through the center of the chaos.
The boat floats onward, approaching a rocky coastline beneath
high windswept cliffs, and at the sight of land the woman
gives an almost imperceptible smile.
CHILD’S VOICE (V.O.)
And please be warned. If you
fidget. If you look away.

CHILD’S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If you forget any part of what I
tell you, even for an instant, then
our hero will surely perish.

*
*

Before the narrator can finish his sentence, another wave,
larger than the others, surges menacingly behind the woman...
EXT. ROCKY BEACH
Propelled by that huge wave, the fishing boat violently rams
into the rocky shore, throwing the woman from the boat.
Tossed through the turbulent undercurrent, the woman’s head
smashes hard against a rock.
And as the ocean recedes, she’s left lying in the sand, her
body limp and unmoving and blanketed by her tangled hair.

*

And then another sound. The CRYING of an infant.
The woman’s eyes snap open.
Slowly, painfully, she begins crawling across the sand
towards the crying. It’s coming from inside that woven bag.
CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
His name is Kubo. His grandfather
stole something from him.

*
*
*
*

As she reaches the bag and draws back the folds of cloth, we
see the face of a baby underneath. We can see his head is
wrapped in a bloodied bandage, covering his missing left eye.

*
*
*

We watch them from a HIGH ANGLE, like we’re standing
somewhere up on those cliffs, as the narrator adds...

*
*

CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
And that really is the least of it.

3/92

A serious monkey. Staring right at us. Fixed expression.
That’s because this monkey is actually a carved wooden charm,
also known as a netsuke, standing about four inches high.
Next to it a young boy, perhaps ten years old, sleeps on a
thin mat on the floor. He is curled up within a robe
emblazoned with the crest of a beetle, just like the one we
saw on the bag earlier.
The boy rolls over, revealing his left eye is covered in a
patch. He is the baby from the prologue, grown into a wiry
youth, with thick black hair tugged into a messy topknot. He
is our hero. KUBO.
INT. KUBO’S CAVE - EARLY MORNING (PRE DAWN)

*

Kubo gets up and begins to tidy up the place, picking up
dozens of strewn pieces of paper that inexplicably litter the
ground. The paper is creased and wrinkled as if it has been
repeatedly folded and unfolded. He smooths each sheet out,
then stacks it and places it back on a shelf.

*
*
*
*
*

By the light of the full moon outside, Kubo walks to a little
kitchen area and strikes a flint, starting a fire.
He gracefully pours and heats a pot of water, preparing both
rice and tea for two place settings on the ground.

*
*

He then turns to regard a sleeping woman, lying on a mat in
the corner of the cave, barely noticeable in the dark. The
folds of her gown move gently as she sleeps.
Kubo steps over and kneels down by her side, and we see this
is the same woman from our prologue, only now she seems older
and paler. Her face is creased and wrinkled like the crumpled
paper scattered around her, and her long black hair is
streaked with silvery grey. She is Kubo’s MOTHER.
Kubo watches her for a moment, then gathers himself and
extends a hand to gently push her hair out of her face.
Her eyes flutter open. She sees Kubo, kneeling there, and he
gives her a small smile. An unspoken “good morning.”

*

Kubo helps her up and to the mat where the rice and tea are
waiting, her movements are slow and feeble.

Kubo serves his mother rice, even blowing on it to cool it
for her.
His Mother eats just a little. A bit of rice falls onto her
chin.
Kubo uses his chopsticks to gently put the grains of rice
back into her mouth. There is clearly something wrong with
his mother.

*

INT. ENTRANCE KUBO’S CAVE - EARLY MORNING

*

Kubo walks his mother over and she kneels on a mat in the
shadow of the cave entrance, staring down at the angry white
crests of the waves.

*

Kubo sits beside her. He works intently, folding those sheets
of paper he stacked earlier into an assortment of origami
figures.
There is a tiger, a deer, and a snake, each as impressive as
the next. His nimble hands make swift and expert work of it.
It’s kind of incredible.
Kubo leans forward, grinning from ear to ear as he plays with
a paper samurai, showing it to his unresponsive mother.

*
*

But then Kubo stops, and gets closer to lean on his mother’s
shoulder as the sun rises.

*
*

A BELL CHIMES in the distance, triggering him instantly into
action.

*

As the orange light of dawn begins to fill the cave, he
hurries over to where the shamisen leans against the wall and
scoops it up with one hand. He grabs the netsuke and all his
origami figures, hastily packs them into his bag and it over
his shoulder.

*
*
*
*
*

Before he leaves he notices a strand of hair has fallen in
front of his mother’s face. He gently reaches out and pushes
it back into place.

*
*

Kubo looks at his mother’s staring empty eyes and rests his
hand on her shoulder for a moment before running off.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - DAWN
Kubo scrambles down the rocky path with practiced ease, his
shamisen occasionally smacking against his hip with a dull
harmonic BUMP, like when you jostle a guitar.
In the distance a cluster of buildings peek out from behind a
brightly ornate gateway. Kubo plays with his origami samurai
as he walks.

*
*

Kubo continues along the path over a bridge into the village,
to a hubbub of activity beyond --

(0400 STT) STORY TIME
EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - DAY
It’s later in the morning and the main thoroughfare has
become a vibrant pageant of peasantry and peddlers
celebrating the second day of the Obon Festival.
- A puppeteer operates an elaborate dragon marionette over
the heads of SQUEALING CHILDREN.
- FISHERMEN proudly waggle their pungent produce. Crustaceans
crawl over each other in open crates.
- A PATIENT DAD AND HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER browse the lanterns
being crafted by skilled artisans.
-HIGH CLASS LADIES barter and haggle for the most fashionable
festival garments.
- MERCHANTS pitch their wares to VILLAGERS from dusty carts.
- MEN gamble on elaborate tile games. Two old curmudgeons sit
in stony-faced contemplation over a chess-like game of Shoji.
And lining the street is the feudal Japanese equivalent of
the Venice Beach boardwalk. A row of BEGGARS and STREET
PERFORMERS, competing for coins, handouts, and attention:
- A hunched beggar woman, KAMEYO sits in the street, with a
bowl in front of her.
She smiles warmly when she sees Kubo walking toward her. She
miraculously straightens up and seems much less woeful.
KAMEYO
Well hello, Kubo!
He slides his shamisen off his shoulder and sits down next to
her. Kubo peeks over the lip of the bowl.

KUBO
How is it today?
KAMEYO
Not a bad crowd. I got two pennies
and a lint ball.
She fishes around in the bowl and pulls out a clump of fluff.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
This is pretty good lint.
Kubo CHUCKLES and the old woman turns to him.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
And what do you have planned today?
KUBO
Oh, you know. The usual.
KAMEYO
(grins)
Monsters?
Of course.

KUBO

KAMEYO
You think you can work in a fire
breathing chicken?
Kubo fixes her with a look.
KUBO
The chicken again?
KAMEYO
(defensive)
The chicken is funny.
Kubo rolls his eye, but he’s clearly enjoying this.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
A touch of comedy to balance the
whole thing out. They’re going to
be throwing money at you, I just
know it.
(thinks this over)
Or they’ll throw something at you,
I don’t know.
KUBO
(LAUGHS)
Okay, I’ll see what I can do.

Kubo stands to leave, but the old woman has one more thing.
KAMEYO
And do you plan on finishing the
story this time, young man?
Kubo just smiles and walks into the center of the square.
In one graceful motion, Kubo drops his bag of origami
creatures on the ground and spins his shamisen around.

*

He grabs the bachi pick from his belt and raises it into the
air, ready to strike.
KUBO
IF YOU MUST BLINK, DO IT NOW!
He then brings it down across the strings, striking a
beautifully resonant chord.
With this, the entire dynamic of the marketplace changes.
- Mid-haggle, merchants and their customers GASP.
- The Shoji players look up from their game. One takes
advantage of the distraction and cheats a winning move while
the other is facing the other way.
- Children watching the puppeteer look over and the puppeteer
turns the head of his dragon, to see what is going on before
the children cheer and run towards Kubo.
SHOUTING ceases, CHATTER trails off. Even the TRILLING of
songbirds in their cages and a distant dog’s BARKING stop.
Everything is silent. All heads are turned.
Kameyo moves through the gathering onlookers, pushing a man
aside.
Kubo stands confidently in the center, his shamisen gleaming
in the sun. Excited WHISPERS ripple through the crowd.
KUBO (CONT’D)
PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING
YOU SEE AND HEAR. NO MATTER HOW
UNUSUAL IT MAY SEEM!
As he paces, Kubo sizes up the circle forming around him.
KUBO (CONT’D)
AND PLEASE BE WARNED. IF YOU
FIDGET. IF YOU LOOK AWAY. IF YOU
FORGET ANY PART OF WHAT I TELL YOU,
EVEN FOR AN INSTANT...

And by this point, there’s really no more need for Kubo to
shout. The entire crowd has fallen still and silent.
He points to a woman and WHISPERS dramatically.
KUBO (CONT’D)
Then our hero will surely perish!
He suddenly shifts into a dramatic pose, plucking his
shamisen like a rock star. He strums a simple theme, and a
red blur shoots from his pack, somersaulting the full length
of the circle before landing at Kubo’s feet.
The crowd CHEERS at the appearance of this origami hero.
Kubo puts up a hand to silence them again, and continues:
KUBO (CONT’D)
Hanzo was a mighty samurai. But he
was alone; his family taken from
him, his kingdom in ruins, and his
army destroyed by the dreaded Moon
King! You may recall, Hanzo was
roaming the distant Farlands in
search of a magical suit of armor;
the only weapon in the whole world
that could protect him from the
power of the Moon King. This armor
was made up of three pieces. The
first...
Kubo pauses waiting for the audience to participate and spins
suddenly, pointing to a group of children. HASHI is standing
behind them, pushes his way through to answer.
HASHI
Oh, oh, oh!!! I know! I know! The
Sword Unbreakable!
Kubo smiles and continues to play. A sheet of paper shoots
from his bag and forms into a samurai sword that hovers in
the air before the crowd.
Kubo sprints over to an adorable little girl, skidding to a
halt in front of her.
KUBO
The second...?
MARI
The Breastplate Imp...
(struggling)
Impen...

Her father, HOSATO leans down and WHISPERS something into her
ear.
MARI (CONT’D)
Impen-a-truh-bubble! Yeah!
The crowd LAUGHS and APPLAUDS the little girl whose cheeks
bloom red with pride.
Kubo plucks the second string and we see an ornate
breastplate form and hover next to the sword.
KUBO
And finally, the third weapon, the
final piece of the armor...
KAMEYO
I know this one! Pick me!
Kubo nods at her.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
The Helmet Invulnerable!
The expectant crowd turn to Kubo for affirmation. He plucks
the third string and a beautiful helmet forms. The crowd
CHEERS. He begins circling the audience, building the
tension.
KUBO
Before Hanzo could claim the armor
and unite the pieces to reveal
their true power, he was attacked
by the Moon King’s beasts!

*

Kubo plucks a dissonant chord and spins suddenly.
A sheet of paper shoots up, folding in mid air, transforming
into a monstrous spider.
The spider creature springs forward and Hanzo charges to meet
it, slashing at its legs with his little paper sword.
The crowd cheers.
KAMEYO
Whoa! Ha Ha Ha!
Kubo launches into a dizzying display, playing his shamisen
like a demon. He’s good!

MONTAGE
In a series of quick cuts we catch various glimpses of Kubo’s
story... one fantastical battle after another, an incredibly
violent display of origami theatrics, with paper body parts
raining like confetti around the square.
- A FEROCIOUS SHARK swallows Hanzo whole, until he slices it
open from inside, shredding it into ribbons.
- An over-excited samurai grasps the shoulders of two women.
Oh yes!

HASHI

- A FIRE-BREATHING CHICKEN forms and belches paper flames at
Hanzo.
- The Beggar Woman CLAPS and CACKLES uncontrollably.
KAMEYO
HA HA! Kill the chicken! Rip it to
pieces!
- Hanzo runs and turns into a flat piece of paper again
shooting under the chicken’s legs to escape. The paper folds
back into Hanzo to the cheers of the crowd.
- Hanzo gets hit by a flying paper egg shot at him by the
chicken. Hanzo turns, runs, and back-flips over the chicken,
lopping off its head with one swipe of his sword.
- The patient dad covers the eyes of his young daughter, who
moves his hands, not wishing to miss a beat.
Oh my!

HOSATO

- The day grows later. Hashi cheers wildly and another man
gags as Kubo continues to entertain the crowd with his
performance with Hanzo.
KUBO
Hanzo was filled with rage, his
soul tormented by the grief of a
family stolen from him...
Kubo begins playing a more ominous tune and paper creeps out
of his pack, folding as it rises into the air, forming the
dark silhouette of the Moon King.
There’s a gravitas to Kubo as he continues.

KUBO (CONT’D)
At last, our hero was face to face
with his nemesis, The Moon King!
The two paper figures fly up in the air at each other poised
for battle, then as they reach fighting distance...
BONG! BONG!
Kubo turns and sees the ringing bell. He lowers his hand and
the origami figures instantly unfold and glide back into his
pack.
KUBO (CONT’D)
(smiling brightly)
So be sure to come back tomorrow!
He hurriedly gathers up his belongings and collected coins as
the crowd behind him realize that’s all they’re going to get
today. They give a MURMUR of disappointment.
HASHI
What? Oh come on! People like an
ending, please! Where are you
going? No....You can’t leave!
(0600 FDM) FADED MEMORY
INT. ENTRANCE KUBO’S CAVE - EVENING
Just as the bell finishes chiming, Kubo arrives breathlessly
at the entrance to the cave, to find his mother still sitting
there like she hasn’t moved at all.
He smiles gently and sits next to her. They both stare out
at the setting sun, sinking down behind the ocean. The last
rays creep down their faces until shadow covers them
completely. Then, Mother slowly blinks awake.
MOTHER
(whispers)
Kubo.
Kubo’s Mother looks around the cave.
Kubo.

MOTHER (CONT’D)

KUBO
Yes, Mother, I’m here.
Kubo smiles softly and takes her by the hand. She smiles at
him.

INT. DINING AREA KUBO’S CAVE - EVENING
CLOSE ON A BOWL.
MOTHER (V.O.)
And even though he could barely see
his own hand in front of his face,
Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai
pressed on through the blizzard.
They’ve finished dinner and Kubo, the monkey, and little
paper samurai sit next to each other watching his mother. She
moves freely now, reminding us of Kubo during his story time.
We can see where Kubo inherited his talents as she pretends
to step through the deep snow, her arm in front of her face
protecting her from imaginary winds.
Kubo stares intently like a child watching his favorite show.
MOTHER
And suddenly, as quickly as it had
started, the storm cleared before
him. Hanzo breathed a sigh of
relief, for he was home!
KUBO
His fortress?! The Beetle Clan
Castle?!!
MOTHER
Yes! At the very edge of the
Farlands, hidden from the Moon King
by powerful magic...
KUBO
And then what happened? When he got
to the castle?
MOTHER
When who got to the castle?
KUBO
Hanzo, my father.
She is genuinely confused.

MOTHER
Hanzo... Hanzo was at the castle?
He... Just give me a
second...I’m...no, no...its gone. I
can’t...I’m sorry, Kubo. Perhaps I
could recall a different story?
This obviously happens a lot... her memory is deteriorating.
Kubo tries to play it down.
KUBO
Mother, what was father like?
MOTHER
(smiles)
Oh, this one is easy. Hanzo was a
mighty warrior, skilled with sword
and bow...
KUBO
No. What was he really like? When
he wasn’t fighting... when he was
with us.
She pauses, caught off guard, then smiles softly. For the
first time, she seems really lucid.
MOTHER
He was just like you.
Kubo smiles.
Like me?

KUBO

MOTHER
Strong and clever and funny. And oh
so handsome!
She leans over and playfully grabs his cheek. Embarrassed,
Kubo squirms and GIGGLES and pushes her away.
KUBO
Ugh, Moth-er!
MOTHER
Aw, Come on!
She gets more serious.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Never forget how much he loved you,
Kubo. He died protecting us.

Kubo hesitates, wondering if he should ask the next question.
KUBO
Did the Moon King-MOTHER
Your Grandfather.
KUBO
Did Grandfather and your sisters
really kill my father? It can’t be
true, can it? They’re family!
His mother is now deadly serious and grabs Kubo’s shoulders.
MOTHER
No, they are monsters! Grandfather
and my sisters stole your eye,
Kubo! They must never find you
again! NEVER! You must always stay
hidden from the night sky, or they
will find you and they’ll take you
away from me! Promise me you will
never let this happen. Promise me
Kubo!

*

Kubo looks into Mother’s eyes and nods timidly. She realizes
she has gone too far and calms a little, backing away.
She has a thought and reaches down to the ground, grabbing
the little monkey statue.
She holds it up to Kubo and speaks in a funny voice.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Don’t be sad Kubo. Kubooo...
Kubo looks up with the hint of a grin. Sariatu continues with
the voice.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Remember what you must do, Kubo? Remem-ber?

She leans across and tickles Kubo with the netsuke.
MOTHER (CONT’D)

Re-mem-ber?
KUBO
Yes, Mr. Monkey
Good boy.

MOTHER

They LAUGH together, until his mother’s brow suddenly creases
and she stops and yawns. It’s clear whatever lucidity was
there before has gone. Kubo sees this every night, but it
never gets easier.
Bedtime.

KUBO

Kubo walks her over to her mat and lays her down. She looks
up at him, innocent as a child.
He sits for a moment longer, watching as his mother drifts
off to sleep, and then he blows out the candle.
FADE TO BLACK.
A beat, and then:
(0700 MON) MOTHER’S NIGHTMARE
INT. KUBO’S CAVE - NIGHT
A SKITTERING sound. Kubo’s origami paper starts flying off
the cave shelf over Kubo, lying fast asleep.
Kubo blinks his bleary eye. Sits up.
CUT WIDE to reveal the roof of the cave is swimming with
origami. A constellation of paper bodies, magically twisting
and animating all around him in the air.
He looks over to see his mother on her mat, tossing and
MUMBLING in her sleep, clearly in the midst of an intense
dream.
Suddenly awake, he runs to his mother.

MOTHER

As she wakes almost instantly the paper throughout the cave
rains down, unfolded and crumpled, onto the floor.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Kubo! Kubo, is that you?
KUBO
Yes, Mother. I’m here.
This seems to comfort her. A confused look comes across her
face.
MOTHER
Kubo, what happened to your eye?
Kubo just looks at her sadly and she goes back to sleep.
Kubo is left staring at the mess of strewn paper, just as
before, and now we understand exactly how it all got there.
(0800 OBF) OBON FESTIVAL
EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - DAY
We see the market square is once again bustling with
activity. Everyone wears their finest clothes and the
buildings all around have been decorated with colorful
Japanese lamps. The Festival is underway.

*
*

Many of the village women are participating in an elaborate
line dance made up of sweeping movements and subtle gestures.
They weave and skip past camera, revealing a busy festival
scene.
Kubo stands watching all of this. He rubs his eye and YAWNS.
KAMEYO (O.S.)
Paper boy! Here! Here!

*

Kubo turns to see that same old woman. She gives a gummy grin
and looks suspiciously like she may have washed her face.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
C’mon, c’mon. Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.
Kubo ambles sleepily in her direction and sits next to her.

Ahhh... I do so love the festival.
A time to celebrate. Y’know, it’s a

There’s fireworks and singing and
dancing and feasting of course...

She playfully tickles Kubo.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
But the best part of all...

*

The beggar woman grabs Kubo about the shoulder, drawing him
in close as she gestures around the square.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
Do you see those lamps and altars?
We use those to speak to the loved
ones that left us behind.
Kubo hears this and his eye widens a little.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
We listen to their tales and guide
their safe return to the blissful
pure land.

*

KUBO
Really? Did you speak to someone?

*

KAMEYO
Yes I did. My husband! His voice
was as clear and loud as the one
you use for your stories.
(shrugs)
In seventy two years he never had a
thing to say. Now he’s gone, I
can’t shut him up.
She LAUGHS fruitily and Kubo’s eye widens more as her words
sink in. In the background, the dance concludes to the CHEERS
of the spectators.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)

She CACKLES conspiratorially into his ear.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
I bet you could make a really nice

Kubo realizes what she’s getting at. His eye darts this way
and that as his mind fills with the possibilities.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
Y’see? Not just a pretty face, huh?
She grins broadly and gives him a friendly nudge.
KAMEYO (CONT’D)
Now hurry along! Go! There’s still
time before dark! Go! Get out of
here.
Smiling excitedly, Kubo runs away through the crowd, pausing
only to wave at the old woman.

(0900 MEA) MEETING ANCESTORS
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
Carrying his bag and lamp, Kubo emerges from a wooded road
that opens onto a serene cemetery beside a river. Replete
with beautiful plants and flowers, there’s nothing macabre
about this peaceful place.
Dozens of families are gathered among the grave markers,
setting up lamps and altars. Nearby, a HOSATO is teaching

Kubo finds some space and fashions a rough altar from stones.
He dumps the origami out of his bag, then creates a simple
yet beautiful lamp from an ivory sheet of paper as he watches
the patient dad discuss the ritual with his daughter.

Then, copying the family, he gets on his knees and begins to
pray. He speaks quietly, awkwardly, under his breath.

KUBO
Hello, father.

I hope you’re well. Uh. I mean, I
know you’re dead, but I hope
everything is... okay...
Kubo thinks about that opening for a moment. He hates
everything that just came out of his mouth. He starts over,
raising his arms and gesturing to his baggy robe.
KUBO (CONT’D)
Look. It’s your robe! Mother says
I’ll grow into it.

Still Kubo’s lamp remains steadfastly unlit. The cemetery is
practically deserted by now. Behind Kubo in the river, dozens
of lit lamps are slowly floating out to sea as the village
bell begins RINGING out the fall of night.
Kubo just stands there defiantly. He glares at his altar,
patience spent. He grabs his unlit lamp and crumples it up,
tossing it angrily to the ground.

WHISPERED VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Kubo looks around, heart racing. He follows the direction of
the voice and sees, across the river, a lone woman clad in
flowing robes, billowing in the breeze.
She has long black hair and wears a wide-brimmed peasant’s
hat pulled low so we cannot see her face. In her bone white
hand she holds a long wooden pipe. This is a SISTER.
THE SISTERS
Little boy. What happened to your
eye?
Kubo takes a step backwards, sensing something is very, very
wrong here.
The strange woman with the hidden face LAUGHS. A horrible,
high-pitched sound, joined by another nightmarish GIGGLE as a
second woman emerges from the shadows, her face also obscured
by a wide-brimmed hat. This one is the other SISTER.
KUBO
Who are you? How do you know my
name?
THE SISTERS
We’re your family, Kubo. Your

looking for you for so long.
Kubo’s eye widens and he takes another step back.
THE SISTERS (CONT’D)
It is so lovely to meet you, Kubo.
Face to face.
As they say these words, they raise their heads in unison and
look up at Kubo to reveal their faces are covered by the
blank features and fixed smiles of terrifying “NOH” masks.
THE SISTERS (CONT’D)
Come, Kubo. Come to your aunties.
Kubo stands frozen and horrified as they begin gliding like
the mist across the river towards him.

her long pipe up to the mouth hole of her mask and takes a
deep puff.
The smoke she exhales twists and coalesces into horrible
shapes that grow and move of their own accord. They are the
DEMONS OF THE PIPE, and they’re after Kubo.
Kubo tears up the path leading back to the village, SHOUTING

And then it is too late.
As Kubo races through the market, the demonic smoke breaks
off from its pursuit of him, rolling like a bank of fog into

In a storm of smoke, fire, and terrified SCREAMS, the demons
tear through the square, destroying everything in their path.

Through their writhing, ethereal bodies he catches sight of
his masked aunts, inexorably gliding up the path toward him.
THE SISTERS
We’re here, Kubo. Your family has
come for you.
Kubo recoils in horror, but has nowhere left to run.
And then a hand appears out of nowhere, pulls Kubo’s shamisen
out of his bag and strikes the strings!
The notes reverberate, rippling out through the demons like a
shock wave.
Kubo turns to see his mother standing over him.
KUBO!
MOTHER!

MOTHER

MOTHER
KUBO, YOU MUST FIND THE ARMOR! IT’S
YOUR ONLY CHANCE! REMEMBER THIS!
She gives him the shamisen and smacks the beetle crest on the
back of his robe, causing two flapping beetle wings to emerge
magically from the robe’s folds!
The wings pump furiously, lifting Kubo up into the air!
Kubo clutches at his mother, accidentally tearing out a few
strands of her hair as he rises up into the sky.
The flapping wings take him higher and higher, away from the
village and towards the ocean. All Kubo can do is watch as
below, the two masked aunts advance on his mother, one
pulling a bladed chain from her robes, the other drawing a
menacing sword.
Mother narrows her eyes and squares off against them, and
there’s a strength and power to her that we’ve never seen
before. She pulls her own sword from her robes and raises it
defiantly.
And then, as if to conceal the horrors from him, Kubo’s robe
envelopes him, cocooning his body and face. The last thing it
covers is his one eye, taking us to -BLACK.

Night has long since fallen, and they’ve made camp inside the

Kubo looks less than thrilled as he huddles amidst frozen

tends to a large conch shell balanced over a small cooking
fire. She uses a splinter of bone to stir at a cloudy liquid
simmering inside.

For a moment, Kubo doesn’t have anything to say. He simply
stares down at the ground with his one eye, glassy in the
moonlight. Whatever thoughts are running through his head, he
keeps them in. Whatever emotions might be at work, he buries.
Monkey watches him thoughtfully and then returns to the fire
and pours some of the mystery stew into a scavenged clam
shell. She holds it in front of Kubo.

She is pointing at a figure, standing smartly to attention at
Kubo’s feet. It is LITTLE HANZO, only bigger, fashioned out
of several sheets of paper folded together.
Still a bit puzzled, Kubo steps over to inspect the origami.
MONKEY (CONT’D)
He’s been standing there for hours.
Quietly judging us. I’m not even

Kubo reaches out to touch the origami, but Little Hanzo
parries his hand, blocking it with his paper sword before
marching away somewhat huffily.

Ow! Back home in the cave, it was
my mother’s dreams that did this.
And the paper always unfolded
itself by morning.

They both look over as Little Hanzo climbs on top of Kubo’s
bag and strikes a regal pose, pointing his sword in the
direction of the blow hole.
MONKEY
What’s that about?
Struck by an impulse, Kubo suddenly reaches forward and turns
the bag that Little Hanzo is standing on slightly, so that
the figure is now pointing his sword in a different
direction. Little Hanzo immediately moves back into his
previous position, pointing his sword in the direction of the
blow hole.
Kubo moves the origami again, so he’s pointing away from the
blow hole. And again, Little Hanzo immediately moves back
into his previous position, pointing his sword in the
direction of the blow hole.

Little Hanzo remains perched on Kubo’s shamisen, pointing the
way beyond the glacier’s broken edge. The ground rises and
rolls through a series of foothills stepping up to a
mountainous wall of cliffs, upon which snow blazes bright in
the midday sun.
Kubo looks up at the sound of melodic CHIRPING above him and
spies a bird, fluttering overhead.

*

Kubo has never seen anything quite like it and lags behind,
taking up his shamisen.
As Kubo plucks the strings, a few sheets of paper spring up
out of his bag, folding themselves into a paper duplicate of
the live bird, which soars up to greet its twin.
Kubo gives a joyous LAUGH that makes Monkey stop in her
tracks. She turns, scowling, only to see the boy skipping and
GIGGLING through the snow as he plays his shamisen. A
contented child, concerns momentarily forgotten.
She sits down to watch, allowing him this moment of relief.
Exhilarated, Kubo plays faster on his instrument, and more
paper shoots out of his bag, spiraling up and forming a
glorious cloud of paper birds in the sky. Startled, the bird
darts away into the clouds.
Kubo’s birds fly and frolic at his command, glittering in the

Kubo is thrilled, and from her perch across the way, Monkey
is also mesmerized.
Kubo falls on his back, CACKLING, facing up into the bright
blue sky as his magnificent flock flutters overhead.
And then Monkey’s face is looking down on him. Serious, of
course, but also a little curious.
MONKEY
You’re growing stronger.
Kubo LAUGHS. He feels it.

You might not want to look quite so
pleased about that.
She sits him up, ushering him onto his feet and brushing down
his robe.

We grow stronger. The world grows
more dangerous. Life has a way of
keeping things balanced.
Kubo reacts to this cynical wisdom by making a face.

As Kubo follows Monkey, something spies on them from behind a
nearby rock. Something big and spiky with freakish claws. Its
gaze seems to be fixed on Hanzo Origami.
Unaware, Kubo is hatching a mischievous idea. As he walks
behind Monkey he delicately PLUCKS the strings on his
shamisen, and one of his paper birds stealthily breaks away
from the flock and dives down from the sky, nipping Monkey
playfully on her backside.
Monkey whirls around, searching for the culprit. But the bird

With no evidence to convict, Monkey turns back around.
But now Kubo notices that, unbidden by him, more birds are
swooping down for a second assault on Monkey, and as they
dive down they reform into three huge paper mosquitos.
They’re already circling Monkey, but just as they get close
enough to strike, Monkey springs into action. Without turning
around, she shoots out an arm and snatches the first
mosquito, grabs the second with her foot and launches into an

KUBO
What? What did you say?
For the first time, Beetle appears to register Kubo and
Monkey’s presence. He looks up at them, and there’s something
a little unhinged about his eyes.
BEETLE
We had a crest! A samurai crest!
He suddenly leaps up and enthusiastically digs into the pile
of scavenged objects, pulling loose the fabric which he
flourishes in front of Kubo and Monkey. It’s a large samurai
war banner, emblazoned with the familiar beetle emblem.
BEETLE (CONT’D)
Have you seen this crest before?
Wordlessly, Kubo turns to show Beetle the same crest on the
back of his robe. Beetle’s eyes light up with excitement.
BEETLE (CONT’D)
THIS IS A MIRACLE! YOU HAVE OUR
ROBES! YOU’RE WEARING OUR ROBES!
(suddenly suspicious)
Why are you wearing our robes?
Before Kubo can answer, Monkey interrupts.
MONKEY
He doesn’t have to answer your
questions. Anyway, who are you?
BEETLE
Many years ago I was cursed,
trapped in this cursed state.
Cursed to wander the Farlands.
Cursed! Or Cur-sed.
As Beetle talks, Kubo casts a curious eye over the scattered
objects. Many have the beetle crest on them. He admires a bow
and arrow leaning against the wall.
BEETLE (CONT’D)
No comrades. No master. Not even a
name or a single memory of the
noble warrior I once was.
KUBO
You used to be a man?

Not just any man... a samurai! I

I mean, I’m either a samurai or a
really bad hoarder.
(rallies)
Either way, inside my thorax beats
the heart of a warrior!
MONKEY
(still suspicious)
If you have no memory, how can you
be certain of anything?
BEETLE
Because I get... flashes. They come
about from objects I find on my
travels. Or sometimes it’s a sound.
Or a smell.
Monkey SNIFFS the air.
MONKEY
(mutters)
You must get a lot of flashes.
Beetle looks sadly at Little Hanzo on his shoulder.
BEETLE
But the memories, they fade, and
all I’m left with is the sense that
I was once part of something much
greater.
Kubo looks up at Beetle sympathetically, and then turns to
Monkey with a pleading face.
KUBO
Monkey! Can I tell him?

KUBO

Beetle’s eyes are wide.
BEETLE
Ha! This is a miracle! I HAVE FOUND
THE SON OF MY MASTER!
Beetle scoops Kubo up into an ecstatic hug, dancing him
around in a circle, then goes to do the same with Monkey.
MONKEY
Don’t even.
He decides against it and goes and hugs Kubo again instead,
then abruptly drops to his knee in front of the boy.
BEETLE
Whatever brings you to these lands,
whatever your quest, it is now my
quest too. I will join you. I’ll
give my life for you if necessary!
KUBO
Wow. You will?

flies in between Monkey and Beetle to get their attention.

Monkey, you said it yourself, our
quest is a difficult one. A
samurai, even a cursed one with no

be helpful.
BEETLE
Yes, I am certain I could be
helpful! Indispensable!

In what way?!
Snatching up his bow & arrow, Beetle suddenly launches an
arrow into the wall.

Firing an arrow into a wall is

Beetle fires four more arrows rapidly, splitting the first
down the middle.

She gestures at the little origami guide, who has positioned
himself further along the tunnel and is pointing the way with
his sword.
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, DEAD END
As they make their way through the labyrinthine tunnels, we
catch up on the end of Kubo’s story. Beetle is obviously
enjoying what he’s hearing. Monkey, less so.
BEETLE
So you used to be a toy monkey?!
MONKEY
Kubo, I really don’t see how this
part is important to the story.

I wasn’t a toy, I was a charm.
Beetle barks out a LAUGH.

Suddenly, Little Hanzo leaps from Kubo’s shoulder, runs ahead
to a bend in the tunnel and slips through a crack in the
wall.

Beetle breaks through the wall to follow him, but as they
round the corner a horrifying monument is revealed: a giant
and grotesque relief carved into the rock wall. It’s a dead
end, but Hanzo continues to point steadfastly ahead.

*

BEETLE (CONT’D)
Well, that doesn’t look good.
Kubo approaches the wall, squinting his eye. Beetle is close
behind him, but Monkey holds back.
MONKEY
Don’t touch anything!
But Beetle is already running his hand over the rock, and
beside him Kubo is prodding his finger into the conspicuous
empty eyehole of one of the carved creatures.

There’s an ominous CLICK.
Beetle and Kubo turn to Monkey, guilt written all over their
faces. Beetle points at Kubo.
He did it.

And then the floor falls away beneath them and they plummet
into darkness.

In a confusion of limbs and SCREAMS they hit solid ground.

themselves from a heap on the ground.
Kubo hears a series of GRUNTS behind him. Beetle is lying on
his back, rocking back and forth on his carapace like a
stranded turtle in a futile effort to get back on his feet.
Okay...

Monkey SIGHS and walks away, leaving Kubo to offer a helping

They catch up with Monkey and the three take in their
surroundings -The chamber is vast, with a shadowy vaulted ceiling above and
a floor covered in a wall to wall carpet of enormous bleached
bones. Tibias, fibulas, ulnas, all piled on top of each other
in a tangled heap. Whatever creature they belonged to was
huge. In the center of the chamber, glowing balefully under a
shaft of light, is a giant disembodied skeletal hand, and on
its palm rests a beautiful golden sword.

Kubo steps forward towards the hand, but Monkey reaches out
and holds him back.

It could be a trap.

Kubo backs away as Beetle scuttles toward the hand.

An eerie CLICKING sound echoes through the chamber as the
ground beneath Beetle’s feet begins to shake. The bones are
twisting and jittering of their own accord and rising up.

*

Monkey and Kubo hop around trying to retain their balance as
the bones lurch and dance under them.

*

Beetle hurries back to his companions, who are staring up
over his shoulder into the shadows of the ceiling. Two fires
are floating high above them... the burning eyes of a giant
skull, peering down as the other bones lock together and
begin to form a horrifying skeletal body, many storeys high.

Poking out of Kubo’s bag right beside his ear, Little Hanzo
points his sword up to the top of the Odokuro’s skull.
Look!

KUBO

Kubo points, as the Odokuro SCREAMS and the flames in his
eyes explode with fury, fully illuminating his head. For the
first time, everyone sees his ghoulish crown: dozens of
swords lodged Excalibur-style in his skull.

The Sword! It’s in his head. Hey!
I’ve got a bone to pick with you!

You see, because he’s made of
bones.

You’re an embarrassment.

Beetle lets loose a stream of arrows, one after the other,
but they bounce harmlessly off its bones or just fly straight
through the gaps.
BEETLE
Uh. This is problematic.

*

*

Odokuro’s outstretched hand reaches down and scoops Monkey up
into the air.

*

Beetle unleashes another volley of arrows. They zip past
Monkey’s head as she is lifted higher.

*

MONKEY
Enough with the arrows!

*

Monkey grabs at swords from the Odokuro’s skull and smashes
them against the hand that is holding her. Each sword
shatters on impact.

Odokuro dangles Monkey over his awful maw, SCREAMING in
triumph, but before he can swallow her there’s another sound.
A melodic BIRD SONG, like we heard earlier, and it signals an
entire flock of paper birds, fluttering out of the shadows
and circling Odokuro’s head in an angry squall.

Below on the temple floor, Kubo plays his shamisen for all he
is worth, maneuvering the origami assault while Beetle
watches on in disbelief.

Beetle draws back his bow and challenges the creature.

The paper birds dive and swoop and Odokuro SHRIEKS with
frustration, swiping and swatting at them.

Odokuro waves his arms, swatting birds out of the air. He
flails madly, dancing back and forth across the temple floor.
Kubo is in danger of being crushed by Odokuro’s stomping
feet, but Beetle throws himself through the air, covering
Kubo as the Odokuro’s foot comes down.
Oh, foot!

A beat, and then both Beetle and Kubo realize they’re
hovering a few feet above the floor. They are stunned to see
a pair of wings BUZZING out from beneath Beetle’s shell.
KUBO
You can fly?!
BEETLE
Apparently, yes!
Beetle is no less surprised but doesn’t waste any time. With
a quick flex of his new wing muscles, he rockets them further
up into the air, careening wildly towards the beast.

*

Monkey watches, dumbfounded, as they crash upon the skull
beside her.

Odokuro ROARS in outrage, as Kubo and Beetle pull at the
remaining swords, frantically trying to find the real deal.

Beetle’s hand grabs a hilt that will not budge. He gives it a
tug, but the blade is stuck tight.

mouth.

As Kubo is flying through the air, an arrow zips by and pins
his robe to the wall, saving him from the fall.

Kubo’s robe starts to rip and he begins to fall again. Monkey
frees herself from the beast’s grip and races up the skeleton
to save Kubo. Just before she gets to him, the Odokuro’s hand
grabs her again.

it free.

Monkey and Beetle look up and see Kubo standing victorious,
the Sword Unbreakable in his hand.

EXT. THE LONG LAKE SHORE - DAY
Beetle, carrying Monkey and Kubo, flies out of the Hall of
Bones and crash lands on the beach below.
Beetle lies on his side as Monkey squats behind him, slapping
mud and leaves onto his wounded wings as a bandage. Little
Hanzo sits on the horned crest of his helmet, swaying every
time Beetle winces.
They are on the shore of a vast lake that stretches so far
into the distance that it’s hard to pick out the horizon from
the sky. All around, great barnacle-encrusted driftwood
wrecks tell tales of feckless fishermen dashed against the

Trying to find its way out. It was
beautiful.

Monkey & Beetle look at each other, not quite sure how to
respond to this. Finally, it is Beetle who offers...
BEETLE
You know something, Kubo? Back when
you just told stories...Before you
went on this great adventure, you
were still very much a hero.

Kubo looks up at Beetle, liking the sound of that. Monkey
does too. She gives Beetle an approving nod.
They go back to eating. Sitting a bit closer together now. We
hold on the moment, savoring it, until...
...it’s interrupted by the distant sound of THUNDER.
Monkey turns sharply and leaps onto the mast. She clambers to
the top where she sits like a silent sentinel.
Mountainous thunderclouds roll across the distant horizon; a
black smudge beneath a vast fiery sky. A storm is coming and
the sun is sinking into the ocean.

We’re going to have to head for
shore. Find a hiding place. And...

Monkey has now switched focus to the bow of the ship.

Monkey drops down to the deck as Kubo and Beetle turn to see
Hanzo Origami standing on the very end of the ship pointing
into the dark waters.

Beetle and Monkey stare at him a moment. Beetle resumes his

It’s the same spot where Kubo and Monkey first crash-landed.
The scrap of cloth is abruptly speared by a metal spike
attached to a long chain. At the other end of it are the

A Sister winds in the scrap of Kubo’s robe and nods.

As she jumps something snags her ankle and yanks her
violently back across the deck. Her leg is ensnared in a
chain, and a flash of lightning reveals the grim silhouette
of a masked Sister, holding the other end of it as she floats
above the boat.
The Sister stares down at Monkey, her WHISPERS inexplicably
audible over the sounds of the storm.

Kubo swims through columns of kelp and schools of flitting
fish. They scatter as lightning FLASHES far above.

An unnatural light, glowing between the inky strands, beckons
Kubo deeper.

He pushes his way through the kelp and there, suspended in
the sea, is the second piece of armor! A golden, shimmering
breastplate, unmoved by the current; a white hot beacon in

Kubo swims faster, reaching out for the breastplate. He then
slides his body into it, the armor magically shrinking to fit

It’s a giant, luminous eye atop a serpentine stalk that

Before he can stop himself, Kubo is staring directly into it.
His eye widens. His limbs fall limp by his side. He is
transfixed.

The sea creature’s body slithers closer and its dreadful arms
open to embrace him.

Monkey moves to strike a death blow, but the Sister suddenly
vanishes into the darkness of the torrential rain.

The Sister lunges at her with a ROAR. Monkey pivots and
raises her sword but as she parries one piece of the broken
chain, the other coils around her body and drives her into

Beetle emerges from the water, triumphantly holding an arrow

The Sister attacks Beetle and disarms him before she is

The Ningen drags Kubo down deeper and deeper into the water,
its eerie light illuminating Kubo’s face while indecipherable
WHISPERS chatter through the gloom. As they descend, the

rimmed with thousands of razor sharp teeth, surrounded by
dozens more of those staring eyes.

filled with SCREAMS as Beetle appears through the water. He
follows up with a volley of arrows, spearing one eyeball

Kubo is suddenly released from the Sea Creature’s grasp, and
blinks himself awake, but he’s out of air and fading fast.

and a thin trickle of blood begins to stain the white of her
fur.

Torn banners displaying the beetle crest flap in the evening
wind as the trio moves through the ruins.
BEETLE
I remember this place.

It’s clear this place was once splendid, filled with weapons
and armor and beautiful works of art. Now all that remains is
covered over in dust and encroaching weeds and bamboo.

There are drawings of Ningen and Odokuro, even sketches of
the armor itself. It seems this place was entirely dedicated
to Hanzo’s search for the armor.
KUBO
This was where my father prepared
for his quest.

*

*

Our heroes walk through it, gazing around in wonder at the
various memories of their journey. Monkey examines up a piece
of paper with an image of the Helmet on it.

*

Kubo spies a stand of intricately printed screens in front of
a doorway across the room. Upon one of them is an
illustration of an amazing golden helmet, just as in Kubo’s
dream! The sweeping lines of the helm curve around an elegant
war mask that mimics the facial features of Hanzo.

Kubo excitedly pushes through the screens.

Moonlight seeps through a tangle of high bamboo growing out
of the ragged remains of a once grand courtyard. Kubo runs
out across a floor strewn by the broken remnants of hundreds
of pieces of ornate samurai armor.

*
*
*
*

BEETLE
There’s something I don’t
understand...Why would the helmet
be here?
Kubo!

MONKEY

*
*

Monkey and Beetle are right behind him, but already smoke is
seeping amongst the shattered armor, thin tendrils snaking up
beneath breastplates, gauntlets, and greaves.

*
*
*

Fingers of smoke slither up around our heroes, constricting
and hoisting them into the air. Beetle’s bow falls from his
hand and CLATTERS to the ground.

*
*
*

A familiar LAUGH echoes through the courtyard.

*

The other Sister, stark and ominous against the full moon,
floats down in front of her captives, smoking pipe in hand.

Oh, Sister. I remember how we

I think we have very different
definitions of family.

The Sister reaches out to Kubo.

*

BEETLE
Don’t you touch him, you witch!

The Sister turns her horrible NOH mask to face him.

*

SISTER
And then there’s you. The thieving
insect who stole my sister’s soul.
What?

MONKEY

*
*
*
*

Noticing the confusion in Beetle’s and Monkey’s eyes, the
Sister throws back her head and GIGGLES again.
SISTER
Oh, this is precious! You’ve been
together all this time and you
haven’t even realized?

*
*
*
*
*
*

A beat of stunned silence.

*

A puff of smoke drifts from the Sister’s pipe across the
ground to Hanzo Origami, and lifts him into the air. She
speaks directly to Beetle as she motions to Monkey.

*
*
*

SISTER (CONT’D)
You took her from us. It was only
fitting we took something from you!
How swiftly those memories spilled
from your head. Wiping out all

Beetle turns to Monkey. Neither can believe what they’re

Monkey looks at him with sympathy.

The Sister CACKLES, finding this scene perversely enjoyable,
and throws Beetle into a wall.

And then she notices Kubo, frantically struggling behind her.
SISTER
(laughing)
I’m forgetting what I came here
for...

*
*
*
*

As the Sister glides toward him, Kubo is finally able to
reach into the back of his belt. With a blur of his hand he
slashes at her with his bachi pick, cracking her mask in half
and breaking the pipe!

*
*
*
*

The smoke demons disappear, the source of their power
destroyed, dropping Monkey and Beetle to the ground.

*
*

The Sister SCREAMS into Kubo’s face, the lower half of her
mask broken away.

*
*

She tosses him across the courtyard, knocking him
unconscious.

*
*

Monkey hefts her sword and launches herself at the Sister.

*

Just as her blade is about to make contact, the Sister spins
and produces two crescent-shaped blades seemingly from
nowhere. Sparks flash across their faces as weapons collide.

*
*
*

The two spin, strike and dodge, a beautiful dance illuminated
by the light of their magical blades.

The Sister’s assault is relentless, and Monkey’s wound is
hampering her defense. Slowly but surely the Sister is
gaining the upper hand.

*
*
*

She rains down blow after blow, forcing the sword from
Monkey’s hand, LAUGHING as she gains the advantage.

*
*

Nearby, Kubo begins to come to, groggy and disoriented. He
suddenly CRIES out...

*
*

Mother!

Monkey sees Kubo and crawls towards him.

*

And then, as the Sister floats into the air preparing to
deliver a fatal blow, a rusted sword spins at her, knocking
her to the ground.

*
*
*

The projectile came from Beetle, and he grabs more swords
from the pile of armor around him.

Beetle runs to where Kubo is comforting Monkey.

Beetle slumps down beside Monkey, who looks up, dazed and
horrified, as the Sister stands over them.

She raises her blade above Monkey’s head.

Monkey looks over to Kubo.

Time seems to slow down. The only sound we hear is the quiet
THUMPING of Monkey’s weakened heartbeat.

Kubo races towards the shamisen, reaching out his hands.

*

*

The Sister’s sword carves through the air toward Monkey’s
neck.

Kubo grabs the shamisen, raking his bachi across the strings
so violently that two of them actually snap in half, and the

Kubo kneels, cradling the shamisen with the two broken
strings in his lap as a steady stream of teardrops fall from
his face and repeatedly strike the one remaining string.
Behind him, with the sound of each tear, shredded scraps of
paper surge up into a tiny blizzard. Within it a pathetic,
flimsy version of Little Hanzo begins to take shape.
Sensing something, Kubo turns to see the figure there. A
pitiful, torn version of its former self.
But Hanzo Origami is not giving up. Using all of his
strength, he drags himself across the floor and points his
sword again.
He slowly rises and goes over to the place where Hanzo fell,
and sees the diminutive figure, damaged but undeterred,
pointing with his sword and staring up at Kubo beseechingly.
Finally, Kubo turns to see what he was pointing at. It’s an
illustration of the Helmet Impenetrable. Only from here it
looks exactly like the bell in Kubo’s village.
CLOSE ON his face, staring as realization dawns.
Kubo packs his bag with the sword, Hanzo Origami, and the
broken netsuke. He ties the straps of the breastplate onto
the side and then steps over Beetle’s broken bow. He pauses
for a moment as he looks at it. Then he kneels down and takes
the bowstring from the shattered wood and wraps it around his
wrist alongside his mother’s bracelet.
And then he picks up his shamisen, closes his eye, and stands
for a moment in the center of the courtyard, the only sound
the FLAPPING of the frayed beetle banners as they billow in
the wind.
Kubo plays one last note, PLUCKING the string as hard as he
can, snapping it completely.
With a RUSTLING, the beetle banners flutter more violently,
twisting and folding and breaking off their mounts. The
banners envelope him, intertwining with his own robe to
become a magnificent pair of wings that lift him up into the
air, soaring above the ruins...

Kubo‘s new wings fly him across the landscape and land him on
central avenue near the bell tower.

*
*

Kubo struggles to his feet and stares up at the bell.

*

Kubo steps over to the blackened wooden scaffold of the bell
tower. It’s quiet enough to hear his footsteps CRUNCH as he
walks. And then, face determined, he starts hitting the
broken tower until it crashes down with the bell.

*
*

Kubo reaches in the rubble and frees the helmet.

*

KAMEYO (O.S.)
Kubo? Is that you?

*
*

The voice surprises him. He turns around.

*

From somewhere across the other side of the main street, a
soot-stained face peeks out from the charred ruin of a house.
It is Kameyo, and she watches the unfolding scene with wide
eyes.

*

Behind Kameyo are Hosato with Mari, and other familiar faces
looking at him with awestruck curiosity.

*
*

KUBO
You have to leave this place. The
Moon King, he is coming.

*
*
*

The survivors see the look on his face and don’t ask
questions. They hurry through the market place toward the
gate out of town.
Kubo waits a moment for them to leave, puts on the helmet and
then takes a deep breath. His hand tightens its grip on the
sword hilt, and he looks up at the full moon hanging
ominously in the sky. Unblinking.

EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - NIGHT
Grandfather throws open his arms and his entire body breaks
apart like a cocoon. We see the blur of a hideous head
trailing a long serpentine body as it launches a hundred feet
into the air. Seeming smaller than ever, Kubo stands there
looking up at this towering beast.
The Moon Beast LAUGHS, shaking the very foundation of the
devastated village.
Kubo YELLS, and runs at the beast, sword held high.
It lunges down at him, fangs bared. Kubo leaps, spinning over
its head and slashing at its pearly white flesh. The sword
connects with a flash of sparks, like metal on metal.
The beast recoils, but whether it’s out of pain or surprise
is not immediately clear. Kubo is upon it again, a dazzling
barrage of blows forcing the monster further back.
Gaining the advantage, Kubo lunges with his sword, slicing
deep into the creature’s vast white eye. The beast ROARS and
thrashes, its enormous tail decimating a scorched building
behind it.
Furious, the beast twists around and comes at Kubo. He ducks
through a charred doorway and somersaults out of a window,
the creature bulldozing the entire building behind him.
Kubo jumps and weaves as the monster lashes out. Each time he
evades its claws or maw, he scores a hit with his sword.
The beast relentlessly pursues him through the blackened
shells of ruined homes. Despite his agility and tenacity,
Kubo is running out of breath. It seems he’s fighting a
losing battle.
Exhausted, he stumbles, and the beast’s jaws lock down around
his body. The armor buckles and cracks around him, and Kubo
is spat out, SMASHING through the remains of a wall.
Painfully, Kubo crawls back onto his feet, bruised and
bloodied.
The creature snaps its tail like a whip, coiling around
Kubo’s body and pulling him up in front of its terrible face.
The spiky tip of its tail hooks under the lip of Kubo’s
helmet and flips it off his head.
Giant tendrils of saliva fly out of its mouth as it hisses...

Kubo CRASHES through branches and bushes, cartwheeling
through the undergrowth leading down to the riverside
cemetery outside the village.
He eventually comes to a stop, barely conscious. His bag
lands nearby, its contents strewn around him.
In the distance we hear the Moon Beast ROAR as it smashes
through the village on its way to finish Kubo off.
Kubo blinks. Slowly pulls himself off the ground.
He reaches out for his sword. From beneath his robe sleeve
the two bracelets around his wrist are exposed. His mother’s
hair and Beetle’s bow string.
Kubo’s fingers pause over the top of the sword hilt. And then
withdraw.
And then, as quickly as he can, he deftly begins re-stringing
his shamisen, using both string and hair.
The Moon Beast thunders closer through the woods.
Two strings in place, Kubo stares at the empty space where
the final string should go.
The Moon Beast appears, and finds Kubo kneeling on the

He then reaches up and plucks out a hair from his own head,
and stretches it across the shamisen.
The Moon Beast CACKLES.

For every horrible thing down here
there’s something far more
beautiful. My mother saw it. So did

As the Moon Beast goes to strike, Kubo plucks the first
string on the shamisen, producing a single BOOMING NOTE.

The Moon Beast stops, surprised.
All the dead paper lanterns in the river suddenly ignite
again, a trail of light snaking from the river all the way to
the broken lanterns scattered throughout the marketplace.

And now, emerging from behind trees and grave markers, come
the surviving villagers. They hold glowing lanterns as they
march to take their place alongside Kubo.
Kubo plucks the final string, producing a NOTE that echoes
endlessly, and the Moon Beast stares down with an expression
of shock. Yet more figures are joining the ranks of Kubo’s
army, but these are glowing with the same otherworldly light
that we saw surrounding the blue herons. These are the
spirits of the dead.
He gestures to his army.
KUBO (CONT’D)
It makes us stronger than you’ll
ever be. These are the memories of
those we have loved and lost. And
if we hold their stories deep in
our hearts, then you will never
take them away from us.
Kubo stands there defiantly, looking up at the Moon Beast,
who has clearly heard enough. The beast rears back and
strikes down at Kubo like an enormous snake.
But as his fanged head lunges at Kubo’s army, it is deflected
by a field of blue light that has appeared around them, just
like the glow that protected Mother’s boat in the prologue.
The Moon Beast is stunned. Shakes his head. Then he strikes
again. And again. Each time he is repelled by the field which
keeps on growing larger and brighter.
KUBO (CONT’D)
And that really is the least of it.
With that, he brings his hand down on his shamisen, STRUMMING
all three strings at once.
The blue glow explodes, and everything is swallowed up in a

up into the moonlight. It is Kubo, his face still partially
hidden in shadow, but we can see he’s wearing a huge smile.
And now we see why...
Standing on either side of him, their hands resting gently on
his shoulders are HANZO & MOTHER, young and resplendent. If
there is a “spirit glow” around them, we can’t quite see it
in this light. They seem as alive and tangible as Kubo
himself.
His eye sparkles in the moonlight as he looks up at the heron
soaring above the sea in the night Sky.
The end.
