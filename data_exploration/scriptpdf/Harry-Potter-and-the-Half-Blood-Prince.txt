EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY
... Diagon Alley just as the front window of OLLIVANDER’S
WAND SHOP EXPLODES. Witches and wizards flee. In the
drifting smoke, DEATH EATERS appear, accompanied by a
tall, sinewy beast of a man, FENRIR GREYBACK. With a
casual sweep of his hand he sends a wizard flying and a
witch screams. In deep b.g., two Death Eaters abduct a
SHROUDED FIGURE (Ollivander). Greyback grins, then
APPARATES, along with the others...
... leaving Diagon Alley behind. The streets of London
appear below once more, and then the river. Black trails
-- the Death Eaters -- streak across the sky and then
turn TRANSLUCENT as they encircle the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE.
Pedestrians peer upward, bewildered, sensing a shift in
the atmosphere. And then...
The BRIDGE CRUMBLES into the THAMES, the image
horrifyingly beautiful, as is the SOUND of it, a ROAR, a
wail, the last cry of a lion. Then the image begins to
FADE and all goes slowly SILENT, until only a WHISTLING
WIND is heard and...

EXT. MILL TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
... tall grasses toss dreamily in a SLANTING RAIN. An
OLD MILL lists like an ancient ruin against a charcoal

she turns for the town in the distance, another witch
materializes: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.
BELLATRIX
Narcissa!

is the SILHOUETTE of a YOUNG WIZARD and a HEADLINE:

Snape fills the last of three goblets with wine.
NARCISSA
I’ve nowhere else to turn,
Severus.
Snape hands her a goblet, extends one to Bellatrix.
BELLATRIX
You must be joking.
Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his own lips.
NARCISSA
I know I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself has
forbidden me to speak of this -SNAPE
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

Put it down, Bella. We mustn’t
touch what isn’t ours.
Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it back
down.

Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly.

Bellatrix goes on MUTTERING as she splashes some wine
into a goblet. Snape turns back, anger flashing in his
eyes.
SNAPE
Take out your wand.
Bellatrix freezes, goblet to her lips. As she lowers it,
a rivulet of red runs out of the corner of her mouth.
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Snape faces Narcissa. Bellatrix, hand faintly trembling,
places the tip of her wand over their LINKED hands.
BELLATRIX
Will you, Severus Snape, watch
over Draco Malfoy as he attempts
to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes.
I will.

A SINGLE STRAND of LIQUID FIRE issues from Bellatrix’s
wand and wends its way around their hands.
BELLATRIX
And will you, to the best of your
ability, protect him from harm?
I will.

A SECOND STRAND of FIRE intertwines with the first.

Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At a
food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.
CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror -LANDS ON... the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. The
HEADLINE: “HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?”
But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM,
tucked at the bottom corner of the back page: “Malfoy
Sentenced to Azkaban.” TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the
piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa and
DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Draco’s eyes look
distant, haunted.

looks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of
GLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As a
TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering
windows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS
DUMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across the
platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.
13

EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME
ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her
teeth: “Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.”
DUMBLEDORE
I once knew a Muggle girl from
Liverpool with hair like spun
silk. No light could resist it...
(turning)
You’ve been reckless this summer,
Harry.
HARRY
I like riding round on the trains.
It takes my mind off... things.
Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore’s hand is ASH BLACK.
DUMBLEDORE
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t
it? The tale is thrilling if I do
say so myself, but I’m afraid now
is not the time to tell it. Take
my arm.
(extending it)
Do as I say.
Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled
Waitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches
out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND
and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a
tornado. Seconds later...

Dumbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street lined
with darkened houses.
DUMBLEDORE
Welcome to the charming village of
Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I

wondering why I’ve brought you

Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW
HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but
nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward the
OPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comes
INTO VIEW:

INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the
floor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner,
keys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the Daily
Prophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.
As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
“CHOSEN.” His gaze rises.
He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered
upon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. The
ceiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this one
strikes Harry’s SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away,
Dumbledore grabs his hand.
Training his light on Harry’s forehead, Dumbledore flicks
a blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to his
tongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on an
OVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wand
into the plump seat cushion.
ARMCHAIR
Merlin’s Beard!
Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though
briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING,
SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or
two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELLWORN lilac pajamas appears.
SLUGHORN
(rubbing his rump)
There’s no need to disfigure me,
Albus!
DUMBLEDORE
I must say, you make a very
convincing armchair, Horace.
SLUGHORN
It’s all in the upholstery.
(patting his stomach)
I come by the stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?
DUMBLEDORE
(nodding to the
ceiling)
Dragon’s blood.
SLUGHORN
Yes, well, I couldn’t very well
use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho!

Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. The
blood on Harry’s forehead only serves to highlight his
scar.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah yes. Introductions. Harry,
this is an old friend and
colleague of mine, Horace
Slughorn. Horace, this is, well,
you know who this is.
(a droll whisper)
Apparently there’s some thought he
may be the Chosen One.
Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.
DUMBLEDORE
So why all the theatrics, Horace?
You weren’t perhaps expecting
someone else, were you?
SLUGHORN
(blinking)
S-someone else? I’m sure I don’t
know what you mean.
Dumbledore raises an eyebrow.

Slughorn caves.

SLUGHORN
Oh all right! The Death Eaters
have been trying to recruit me for
over a year. Do you know what
that’s like? One can only say no
to these people so many times
before they...
DUMBLEDORE
Take matters into their own hands?
Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.
SLUGHORN
I never stay anywhere more than a
week. The Muggles who own this
place are in the Canary Islands.
DUMBLEDORE
Well, I think it should be put
back in order for them, don’t you?
Mind?

Dumbledore raises his wand. Instantly, the grandfather
clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns reignite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just as
the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant
MUSICAL run.
That was fun.

DUMBLEDORE
May I use the loo?

As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.
SLUGHORN
Don’t think I don’t know why
you’re here, Albus! The answer is
still no! Absolutely,
unequivocally no!
Dumbledore doesn’t respond. Slughorn glances at Harry.
The silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then:
SLUGHORN
You look very like your father.
Except for your eyes. You’ve
got -HARRY
My mother’s eyes, yeah.
SLUGHORN
(smiling softly)
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright -- your mother.
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.
HARRY
One of my best friends is Muggleborn. She’s the best in our year.
SLUGHORN
Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m
prejudiced! No, no, no! Your
mother was one of my absolute
favorites! Look, there she is.
Right up front.
Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS.
SLUGHORN
All mine, each and every one. Exstudents, I mean. You recognize
Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor
of the Daily Prophet.

Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particular
BOY, a boy who resembles... Sirius. Seeing Harry thus
distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.
SLUGHORN
Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no
doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I
taught the whole Black family
except Sirius. Shame. Talented
boy. I got Regulus when he came
along, of course, but I’d have
liked the set.

values. Professor Slughorn is

Harry. You would be his crowning
jewel. That is why he is
returning to Hogwarts. And it is
crucial he return...
Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before
he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the
moon.
DUMBLEDORE
I fear I may have stolen a
wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was, truthfully, very pretty.
The girl.
HARRY

The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY -- Welcome to Diagon
Alley! -- as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath. All
around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or
SHATTERED. People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of
the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY
POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST. Bellatrix is
there: “KNOWN DEATH EATER,” And Greyback: “WEREWOLF.”
And LUCIUS MALFOY: “CAUGHT.”
HERMIONE
How is it Fred and George are
doing it? Half the alley’s closed
down.
RON
Fred reckons people need a laugh
these days.

Reckon he’s right...
Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking halfsmile.

(BORGIN). He POINTS. Draco walks to a LACQUERED
CABINET, plays his fingers over its glassy surface.
Narcissa speaks and Draco turns, finds Borgin holding the
curtain to the back room aside. Draco hesitates, then
follows his mother through.
RON
What’re they playing at?
Dunno.

HARRY

RON

Hey. Where’s Hermione?

Hermione moves through the shadows, alone, peering down
side streets, each darker than the next, lost, but
holding it together, when... a SHADOW FLICKERS overhead.
She looks up, sees a FIGURE (Greyback) leap from one roof
to another. She stands perfectly still, then... hears
VOICES.

Harry and Ron race down one passage then another.

Hermione creeps to the end of a narrow passage, toward

FIGURES encircle an old cauldron, among them Greyback,
Bellatrix, Narcissa, and in the very center... Draco.
Hermione squints against the brilliance of the FIRE, the

left arm... when a SHADOW falls over Hermione, fingers
find her arm. She wheels, terrified.

A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining
the interior a deep scarlet. Students read, play cards.
In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.
As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR
SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches
them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the
accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting
with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a
sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI).
Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the
accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry
reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK
LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes
the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump
into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of
the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- just
as it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes
softly, raining DARK POWDER.

say, has agreed to resume his old
post of Potions master. Meanwhile

confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously
at him.
SLUGHORN
Now Amortentia doesn’t create
actual love, of course. That’s
impossible. But it does cause a
powerful infatuation or obsession.
For that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this
room.
Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into
the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the
cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds
Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing,

rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the
resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers
the instruction again.
As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to the
margin, where a modification has been written in the
tight scrawl:
“Crush with blade -- releases juice better.”
Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the
flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk
runs RED with juice.
HERMIONE
How did you do that?
Crush it.

HARRY
Don’t cut it.

HERMIONE
No. The instructions specifically
say to cut.
No.

Really --

Sh!

Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into
his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins.

Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding

bubbling potion.

So perfect I daresay one sip would

He briefly balances the ring upon the tip of an ashen

face is troubled. A KNOCK. He takes the ring and diary,
slips them inside a drawer. The door swings open,
reveals Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Harry. You got my
message, I see. Come, come. Sit.
Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously.
So.

Sits.

DUMBLEDORE
How are you?

Fine, sir.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE
Enjoying your classes? Professor
Slughorn, for one, is most
impressed with you.
HARRY
I think he overestimates my
abilities, sir.
Do you?
Definitely.

Dumbledore smiles affectionately, nods.
DUMBLEDORE
And what of your activities
outside the classroom? Do they
bring you satisfaction?
Sir?

In any event, I’m sure you’re
wondering why I’ve summoned you
here tonight. The answer lies
here.
Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS
of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers.
DUMBLEDORE
What you see before you are
memories. In this case pertaining
to one individual: Voldemort. Or
as he was known then... Tom
Riddle.
Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes
a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age.
DUMBLEDORE
This vial contains a most
particular memory -- of the day I
first met him. I’d like you to
see it. If you would...
Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises,
gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips
the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and
Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking
the surface...

A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads
Dumbledore down a drab corridor. CHILDREN’S VOICES carry
from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the
midst of some game.

MRS. COLE
I must confess to a bit of
confusion upon receiving your
letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all
the years Tom’s been here, he’s
never once had a family visitor.
Frankly, I was stunned to find
that someone knew of his
existence.
DUMBLEDORE
I am not family. But his name has
been known to me since birth.
I see...
But she doesn’t really.

MRS. COLE
She stops, frowns.

MRS. COLE
I think I should tell you. He’s a
funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There
have been incidents with the other
children. Nasty things.
DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps you could give me an
example.
Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves
off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing,
depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and
a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.

MRS. COLE
Well, I’ll leave you two to

Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door. Dumbledore studies
Riddle, then begins to tour the room. Carefully placed
upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS. A grouping of
SEVEN STONES... A book containing SEVEN MATCHES. SEVEN
BRASS KEYS...
Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing his
FINGERS over its surface, as if the wood’s grain were
Braille, as if somehow “seeing” what lies within.
Then Dumbledore pauses. Strewn on a small table are a
grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS. A BOY and GIRL, their
faces anguished. A sea-swept CAVE. The same cave from
the photograph. Dumbledore begins to reach out...
Don’t.
Dumbledore stops, turns.

Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and
INTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back
and forth.
TOM RIDDLE
You’re the doctor, aren’t you?
No.

DUMBLEDORE
I am a Professor.

Tell me some of the things you can

TOM RIDDLE

I can make things move -- without

happen to people who are mean to

Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up.
Who are you?

TOM RIDDLE

DUMBLEDORE
I’m like you, Tom. Different.
Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.

Open it. Open. It.
Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and
throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail
of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.
Take it out.

DUMBLEDORE

As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing
the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE -the only sound in the now-silent room.
DUMBLEDORE
Is there anything in that box you
ought not to have?
Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He
spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE,
and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN.
DUMBLEDORE
Why did you want these things,
Tom?
TOM RIDDLE
(looking off)
I like having things that belonged
to other people. It makes me feel
... close to them.
Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this.
DUMBLEDORE
Thievery is not tolerated at
Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will
be taught not only how to use
magic, but to control it.
Understood?

I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave

Did I know that I had just met the
most dangerous Dark Wizard of all

Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks
up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented
face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE
Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
Tom Riddle grew close to one
particular teacher. Can you guess
which teacher that might be?
HARRY
You didn’t bring Professor
Slughorn back simply to teach
Potions, did you, sir?

seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a

Slughorn. They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.
Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry -blocking his view.
No, no.

HARRY
Sit next to me.

Ron stops, exchanges another glance with Hermione.

Slughorn in view.

action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards
him with amused curiosity.
Hello, sir.

Wonderful to see you.

Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths:

As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as

Good to see you, Wallenby.
Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry.
RON
What’re you playing at?
HARRY
Dumbledore asked me to... get to
know him.
RON
Get to know him?
HARRY
Dunno. But it must be important.
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.
Slam! Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug
as well. Ron gestures to her upper lip.
RON
Um... You’ve got a little...
Without a thought, she flicks her tongue up, wipes it

The snow falls heavily now. Ron and Harry walk together,
while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting
happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue.
RON
Bit worried about her. Did you
hear that rubbish she was talking
back in the pub? Her and me
snogging. Ha. As if...
LEANNE (O.S.)
Katie. You don’t know what it
could be!
Up ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting
snow, ARGUING. Katie holds a SLENDER PACKAGE. Hermione
comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys.
HERMIONE

What’s up?

At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE
AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face
remains eerily placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and
Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she
FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED
UP in her skull.
I warned her!

Hermione looks.

LEANNE
I warned her not to

Lying in the snow is the PACKAGE, TORN.

RON
Harry, she’s swallowing her

Hagrid.
Get back!

He says this so forcefully the others instantly obey.
Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie’s thrashing body and
then, as if calming a terrified animal, presses his face
close to hers and WHISPERS with great TENDERNESS:
Now, now.

HAGRID
Now, now...

Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like
a mantra, until Katie’s lids flutter and her body goes
limp.
HAGRID
Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the
wrappin’s. Unnerstan’?
Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry
kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL
NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds
package and rises. Then, along with the others, he
watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms. In
seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound
is the ROAR of the WIND.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
You’re sure Katie did not have
this in her possession when she
entered the Three Broomsticks,
Leanne?
LEANNE
It’s like I said. She went to the
loo and when she came back she had
the package. She said it was
important she deliver it.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Did she say to whom?
Leanne shakes her head.

McGonagall nods. Snape takes his wand, lifts the
necklace like a dead snake. Eyes it with fascination.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What do you think?
SNAPE
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be
alive.
HARRY
She was cursed, wasn’t she? I
know Katie. Off the Quidditch
pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly. If
she was bringing that to someone,
she wasn’t doing it knowingly.
Snape eyes Harry levelly.
Yes.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
She was cursed.

It was Malfoy.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That’s a very serious accusation,

Indeed.

HOURGLASS sits in the center of the table.

Hermione exchanges a wry glance with Harry, who notices

For those of you who don’t know,
Marcus’ uncle invented the

As he speaks, Belby never once looks up from his plate.

Slughorn steps to a makeshift bar, begins to construct a
drink.

Slughorn gestures to the PHOTOGRAPHS seen earlier, now
ranged like a menagerie atop a low bookcase. Once again,
Lily Potter and Regulus Black up front.

I don’t really know how to answer

Your mother was modest too. Your

Slughorn smiles genially, turns back to his drink, using
a pair of TONGS to drop ice into his glass.
HARRY
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf,
sir?
Slughorn stiffens, his back to Harry. His hand trembles
and the ice slips from the tongs. Harry notices.

Slughorn turns, studies Harry.

SLUGHORN
Of course. It’s only natural that
you should want to know more. I’m
afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry. When I first met young Mr.
Riddle, he was simply a quiet,
albeit brilliant, boy committed to
becoming a first-rate wizard. Not

WHISPERS CONSPIRATORIALLY.

As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the
Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.
One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS

and... almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain
as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry

goal. Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron
streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in
the opposite direction. Ginny pauses on her broom,
stunned.

She glances up at Harry, circling high above and he
grins. Just then, Dean streaks by:
Ginny!

the cabinet and places it within. Shuts it. Closing his
eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible.

Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then
exits, taking Harry’s gaze with him, to Slughorn once

Ginny, copper hair gleaming, races through the reeds.
Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly.
Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers

forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of
smoke evaporates, reveals... Greyback. Bellatrix makes

edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him
and revealing...

No, Harry!

Harry falters, looking toward Ginny’s voice and spies
Greyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks

she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER
of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels
away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face

Greyback, sharp teeth glittering.

He grins... when Bellatrix’s odd, CLICKING signal carries
through the night once again. Turning away, he exits.
Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at
each other wordlessly. Then... Ron, Fred, George, Arthur

Harry slumps into the darkened dormitory. Stops. On the
floor, glittering in the moonlight, is a trail of CANDY
FOILS. A bit further along, Ron sits in his PJ’s upon
the window sill, a HEART-SHAPED BOX by his side.

It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

RON
I can’t stop thinking about her,
Harry.
HARRY
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she
was starting to annoy you.
RON
She could never annoy me. I
think... I think I love her.
Excuse me?
Ron nods.

HARRY

Harry looks bewildered.
HARRY
Well... Brilliant.
RON
Do you think she knows I exist?
HARRY
Bloody well hope so. She’s been
snogging you for three months.
Snogging?

Harry stares at Ron... then grins.
Okay.

HARRY
Very funny.

He turns to his bed, throws back the covers when... the
heart-shaped box caroms off his head.
HARRY
What the hell was that for?
It’s no joke!

RON
I’m in love with

HARRY
Okay! Fine! You’re in love with
her! Have you ever actually met
her!
No.

RON
Can you introduce me?

Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then
glances at the candy box at his feet. There is an
envelope. Taking it, he slides out a card: “Dear Harry.
Thinking sweet thoughts of you. Happy Valentine’s Day.
Romilda.” He suppresses a smile.
HARRY
Ron, these chocolates, they’re -C’mon. I’m going to introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

The door OPENS. Slughorn stands in a GREEN VELVET
DRESSING GOWN and matching NIGHTCAP, looking bleary-eyed
and annoyed. Something SMOKES on the floor behind him -the FLOOR LAMP he’d sent wobbling the night of the dinner
party.
SLUGHORN
Yes???!!!!
(warily)
Oh. Potter. It’s you. I’m
afraid I’m busy at the moment -He starts to close the door.

Harry sticks his foot in.

HARRY
Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t
bother you if it weren’t
absolutely -RON
Where’s Romilda?
Slughorn squints over Harry’s shoulder at Ron who is
doing precisely the same from the other side.
SLUGHORN
What’s the matter with Wenby?
Harry leans forward, WHISPERS into Slughorn’s ear.

INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of
powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a
mirror. As he paces, Harry passes “the shelf” and finds,
front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn -the one taken at the Christmas party. In deep b.g. is
photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching his
POTIONS TEXTBOOK.
SLUGHORN
I’d have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time,
Harry -- an expert potioneer like
you.
HARRY
I figured this called for a more
practiced hand, sir.

RON
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
Slughorn and Harry turn, watch Ron WINK into the mirror.
Hm.

SLUGHORN
Perhaps you’re right.

As Slughorn goes back to mixing, Harry eyes him
furtively.
HARRY
I’m sorry, sir. About the other
day. Our... misunderstanding.
Slughorn eyes Harry briefly, looks away.
SLUGHORN
Yes, well, water under the bridge
as they say, correct?
HARRY
I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of
it, after all these years. The
questions. About... Voldemort.
Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly.
SLUGHORN
I’ll ask you not to use that name.
Slughorn’s stare is fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in
hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery.
HARRY
Yes, sir. It’s just, well,
Dumbledore once said that fear of
a name only increases fear of the
thing itself. It seemed sensible.
SLUGHORN
With all due respect, Dumbledore
sometimes forgets that most of us
do not possess powers so great
that we can risk offending the
most dangerous Dark Lord who ever
lived.
Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away.
SLUGHORN
Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up!

Then his grin sags.

RON
What happened to me?
HARRY

Love potion.

SLUGHORN
And a bloody strong one at that.
RON
I feel really... bad.
SLUGHORN
Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy.
(eying Harry again)
Do us all good, I think. I’ve got
butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a
dazzling oak-matured mead. I had
other intentions for this but
given the circumstances...
Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.
As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry.
SLUGHORN
There we are, Potter. To life!
CRASH! -- Ron’s glass hits the floor and he crumples to
his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING
horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to
him.
Ron!

Ron!!!

HARRY
Professor, help him!

SLUGHORN
I d-don’t understand -Professor!

HARRY
Do something!!

Slughorn shuffles haplessly through his bag, MUMBLING, at
a loss. Harry turns back to Ron -- his skin is turning
BLUE.
He’s choking!!

Harry glances about, then leaps up, and frantically
begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking
for something, anything. A box tumbles, something
spills: a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robin’s
egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open
Ron’s jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. Instantly
Ron stops moving, paralyzed. The room is suddenly
silent. He’s not breathing. Harry places both hands
behind Ron’s head and gives it a SHAKE. Another.
HARRY
Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a
prat. Breathe! BREATHE!
Harry shakes him again and again... then stops. Ron’s
head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on,
mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great
hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and
Ron is back. Breathing.
RON

Harry grins.

INT. HOSPITAL WING - EARLY MORNING (LATER)
Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Ginny and a very
somber Hermione circle Ron’s bed as MADAM POMFREY
ministers to him. Slughorn sits off to the side, in a
chair, looking stunned.
DUMBLEDORE
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must
be very proud of your student, eh,
Horace?
Hm?

Oh.

SLUGHORN
Yes... very proud.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I think we all agree that Mr.
Potter’s actions were heroic. The
question is: Why were they
necessary.
Why indeed.

Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still
bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.

This appears to be a gift, Horace.

remarkably subtle hints of
licorice and cherry when not
polluted with poison.
SLUGHORN
Actually I had intended to give it
as a gift myself.
DUMBLEDORE
To whom might I ask?
SLUGHORN
You, Headmaster.
Just then -- the DOOR BURSTS OPEN:

Lavender Brown.

LAVENDER BROWN
Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won!
Has he been asking for me?

daggers)
What’s she doing here?
HERMIONE
I might ask you the same.
LAVENDER BROWN
I happen to be his girlfriend.
HERMIONE
I happen to be his... friend.
LAVENDER BROWN
Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t
spoken in weeks. I suppose you
want to make up with him now that
he’s suddenly all interesting.

He’s been poisoned, you daft
dimbo! And for the record, I’ve
always found him interesting.

Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione
takes his hand. Instantly, he falls unconscious again.
Lavender, vibrating with rage, stalks out. Dumbledore
beams.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah, to be young and feel love’s
keen sting. Come, everyone, I
think Mr. Weasley is well tended.
As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies
him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she
indicates Ron and Hermione.
GINNY
‘Bout time, don’t you think?
Harry watches her go, hopelessly smitten, sees that
Slughorn has paused in the doorway.
SLUGHORN
I’ve always cherished my students.
They’re my life...
Then he is gone too. Harry turns back, studies Hermione,
hand enfolded over Ron’s. She looks up, sees his faint
smile.
Oh shut up.

INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

Harry spoons soup into his mouth while perusing the HalfBlood Prince’s Potion book, his eyes lingering, as
before, over the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: “For Enemies.” Ron
absently twirls his wand as he covertly eyes Lavender.
Hermione frowns over the Prophet when... a snowflake
falls upon her nose.
Ron. Stop.

Harry pauses on his soup, exchanges a glance with
Hermione, who carefully withdraws her hand from Ron’s.
HERMIONE
Um, well, she came to visit you in
the hospital, you see, and you
talked -- I don’t believe it was a
long conversation -RON
Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody
thrilled to be shot of her. It’s
just she seems... a bit put out.
As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are
rewarded with a lethal squint.
HERMIONE
Does, doesn’t she? And you say
you don’t remember a thing from
that night? Not one thing?
RON
Well... there is... something.
(as Hermione hangs)
But no. It can’t be. Besides, I
was completely boggled, wasn’t I?
Right.

HERMIONE
Boggled...

Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his
attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls
surrounds a new arrival.
That’s Katie.

HERMIONE
That’s Katie Bell.

Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls.
After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing
before her.
HARRY
How are you, Katie?
KATIE BELL
Give me a moment, girls.
The girls drift off.

Katie’s eyes shift. She goes ashen. Harry turns,
follows her gaze and finds... Malfoy, staring at her.
Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry
watches her go, then looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing
the Hall.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Malfoy hurtles past, forehead gleaming with sweat, passes

he passes the birdcage... we HOLD. It’s now EMPTY.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME - DAY

Malfoy lurches to the mirror, steadies himself against
the sink. Then, with a great, heaving shudder begins
to... CRY.
In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open:
Harry. He stops, stunned. Malfoy’s eyes shift.
Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand.
WHOOSH! The LAMP next to Harry’s head SHATTERS. FLAMES
spider up the ceiling.
Harry draws his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind
Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the ceiling, rains down.
Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself.
MALFOY
Cruci-HARRY
SECTUMSEMPRA!
BLOOD SPURTS from Malfoy’s face and SCARLET SLASHES OOZE
through the white of his shirt. He staggers, HOWLS again
and COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his wand in horror, then
slushes across the floor, the water running red with
Malfoy’s blood.

Harry stops dead... transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING
DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy’s
shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.
Seeing Malfoy -- and the nature of his injuries -- he
eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces the
TIP of his WAND over Malfoy’s wounds, MURMURING an EERIE
INCANTATION. Instantly, the skin begins to knit itself
together. Harry backs away, Snape’s ancient CHANT
ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers
on the floor, backing away until he reaches the door...

INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY

Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his

Over the years, if someone had a

HARRY
Who showed you this?

First.

GINNY
Fred and George. First year. I

As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a
SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby. They turn, look off.
GINNY/HARRY

What was that?
They turn back, look at each other.

Ginny smiles.

Then:

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND VANISHING CABINET
Harry and Ginny approach. The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER.
Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry. Reacts.
The cabinet door VIBRATES. Slowly, he opens it and...

wings.

See, you never know what you’ll

Harry nods, looks back to the cabinet, mystified.

blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead.

Harry, looking a tad dazed, walks aimlessly.
So.

RON (O.S.)
Did you and Ginny do it?

Harry jumps, watches Ron appear.
HARRY

What?
You know.
Oh.

RON
Hide the book.

Yeah.

HARRY

Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor
and -- spying Harry -- does a little Oliver Hardy “Oops”
and retreats.
RON
Still no luck with Slughorn, I

Harry shakes his head -- then stops cold, stares at the
empty space where Slughorn stood moments before.
HARRY

The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harry’s palm

Filch paces, standing guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly

Mrs. Norris -- who HISSES. The mouse makes a quick
retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down. As Filch

TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds. Harry
approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the
last second, something on the ground catches his eye. He
KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning
helplessly. Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny
bug gain purchase, then tips it upright...

Harry HUMS placidly. Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond
the steamy panes of the Greenhouse. It’s Slughorn,
hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily,
resisting his attentions. Snip! He stealthily removes a
sprig, looks up and JUMPS.
SLUGHORN
Merlin’s beard, Harry!
HARRY
Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced
myself. Cleared my throat.
Coughed. You probably feared I
was Madam Sprout.
SLUGHORN
Well, yes, actually -(paranoid)
Why would you think that?
HARRY
Just the general behavior, sir.
The sneaking around. The jumping
when you saw me. By the way,
those Tentacula leaves -- they’re
quite valuable, aren’t they?
SLUGHORN
Ten galleons a leaf to the right
buyer -- not that I’m familiar
with such back alley transactions.
One hears rumors is all. My own
interests are purely academic, of
course.
HARRY
Personally, these plants have
always kind of freaked me out.
Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.
Slughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly.
SLUGHORN
Exactly how did you get out of the
castle, Harry?
HARRY
Through the front doors, sir. I’m
off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a
very dear friend and I felt like
paying him a visit. So if you

Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along...

SLUGHORN
Harry, I must insist you accompany
me back to the castle immediately!
HARRY
That would be counterproductive,
sir.
SLUGHORN
And what makes you say that?
No idea.

Slughorn frowns impatiently -- then stops, blinks.
SLUGHORN
Merlin’s beard...
Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump.
Nearby, Aragog’s massive body lies legs up.

making a CLICKING sound. Hagrid eyes Harry curiously.
HAGRID

HARRY
Through the front doors.
SLUGHORN

vial or two -- purely for academic
pursuits...

human friends find solace for the
loss they have sustained.

Hagrid wipes his eyes, then rises. He walks to Aragog,
studies him lovingly, then puts a shoulder to the big
beast’s body... and sends him tumbling into the freshlydug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK.

HAGRID/SLUGHORN
To the place he’d known as a lad,
They laid him to rest with his hat
inside out and his wand snapped in
two, which was sad...
As they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops off

SLUGHORN
It was a student who gave me

discovered a bowl upon my desk
with a few inches of clear water.
There was a flower petal floating
upon the surface. As I watched,
the petal sank, but just before it
touched bottom... it transformed.
Into a wee fish. It was beautiful
magic, wondrous to behold. The
petal had come from a lily.
Hearing “lily,” Harry looks up.

Slughorn nods.

bowl empty... was the day she...

She didn’t just die for me that
night. She died for you too. She
died for everyone who’s ever woken
in the middle of the night afraid
a Death Eater waited on their
doorstep.
Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him.
HARRY
Professor. I’m going to tell you
something, something others have
only guessed at. It’s true. I am
the Chosen One.
Slughorn looks up.

Harry nods.

HARRY
Only I can kill him. But in order
to do so, I need to know what Tom
Riddle asked you that night in
your office all those years ago.
And I need to know what you told
him.
Slughorn’s eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.
HARRY
Be brave, Professor. Be brave
like my mother. Otherwise you
disgrace her. Otherwise she died
for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl
remains empty forever.
Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle.
Finally, slowly, he removes his wand.
SLUGHORN
Don’t think too badly of me once
you’ve seen it. You don’t know
what he was like... even then.
Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one with the WORM
-- but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to
take it. Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to
his temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD. Harry
extends the vial and... it drops within.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of

SLUGHORN

TOM RIDDLE
I was in the library the other
night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic and I
thought perhaps you could
illuminate me. It’s called, as I
understand it... a Horcrux.
Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.
Excuse me?

SLUGHORN

TOM RIDDLE
Horcrux. I came across the term
while reading and I didn’t fully
understand it.
SLUGHORN
I’m not sure what you were
reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark
stuff, very Dark indeed.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. Which is why I came to
you. I mean no disrespect to the

if anyone could tell me... it
would be you.

SLUGHORN
A Horcrux is an object in which a
person has concealed part of their
soul.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, I thought it might be
something like that. But I don’t
understand how that works, sir.
SLUGHORN
One splits one’s soul and hides
part of it in an object. By doing
so, you are protected should you
be attacked and your body
destroyed.
Protected?

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN
That part of your soul that was
hidden, lives on. In other words,
you cannot die.
Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the
MIRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his
eyes.
TOM RIDDLE
How does one split his soul, sir?
SLUGHORN
I think you can guess the answer
to that, Tom.
Murder.

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.
After, one is never the same.
TOM RIDDLE
Out of curiosity, sir -- can you
only split your soul once? For
instance, isn’t seven the most
powerfully magical number -SLUGHORN
Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom!
Isn’t it bad enough to think of
killing one person? To rip the
soul into seven pieces...

palpable.

things that are unimaginably

him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames
above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.
HARRY
Do you mean to say he succeeded,
sir? In making a Horcrux?

Oh he succeeded. And not just
once. Think, Harry. He’s just

It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years

of magic. Very dark. Very
powerful. But until tonight, I

Just then, as the flash of Harry’s fingers make contact
with the ring, IMAGES FLASH by in DIZZYING succession:
VOLDEMORT’S FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE,
deep in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as
it tumbles from an old woman’s hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI)
slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore slipping the
ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays...
DUMBLEDORE
... leaves traces.
Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring
skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand
to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face.
Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at
Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching
the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen
fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow
“see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation -- and recognition
-- flicker over his face.
HARRY
It’s where you’ve been going,
isn’t it, sir? When you leave the
school.
Harry’s eyes drift once again to the postcard on the
desk. Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still
studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes. And I think... perhaps... I
may have found another. But this
time I cannot hope to destroy it
alone.
Harry peers into Dumbledore’s eyes.

Dumbledore nods.

As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears
VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering
up through the grid-like floor above: Dumbledore and
Snape.
SNAPE
Have you ever considered that you
ask too much? That you take too
much for granted? Has it ever
crossed your brilliant mind that I
don’t want to do this anymore?
DUMBLEDORE
Whether it has or hasn’t is
irrelevant. I will not negotiate
this with you, Severus. You
agreed. There’s nothing more to
discuss.
Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore
squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his
back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can
react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape
falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As
his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.
Dumbledore turns. Smiles.
DUMBLEDORE

friend.
Harry runs his hand over his face.

eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder. As Harry
glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes
beyond. Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a
towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the
light from his wand.
DUMBLEDORE
This is the place. Oh yes, this
place has known magic.

Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle

when he was but a poor orphan boy
with a penchant for cruelty...
Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face
registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.
He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the
rock.
DUMBLEDORE
One wintry afternoon, he lured two
younger classmates to this cave.
What happened is unclear. But
this much is known: the children
were damaged.
Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his
fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open.
He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade
across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet
beads.

The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble,
forming a narrow opening.

Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry’s horror walks right to
the lake’s edge. As the dark water laps over the toes of
his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the
air, then closes it... as if gripping something
invisible. Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a
TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin
air, extending from the water to Dumbledore’s hand.

Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he

hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling
water.
Harry tips the water into Dumbledore’s mouth. Dumbledore
blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns

darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.

Dense with shadow. Strange slashes of light. Malfoy, a

Vanishing Cabinet, steps back...
He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and
begins to CHANT eerily. The surface of the cabinet
glimmers, atremble in the ambient light. Almost alive.
Then he stops. Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips

Okay.

Harry gently disengages from Dumbledore, leaves him
leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell
door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING
WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.
HARRY
Sir, are you... praying?
DUMBLEDORE
(smiling faintly)
No, Harry. I do not pray. I was
merely closing a window -- the one
that had allowed us to Apparate.
Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS
sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head,
listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his
infirmity.
DUMBLEDORE
Hide yourself below. And do not
speak or show yourself without my
permission. No matter what.
Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to
the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER.
DUMBLEDORE
Do as I say, Harry.
Harry hesitates.

Dumbledore’s eyes blaze...
DUMBLEDORE

Trust me.
Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and
slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below,
the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the
grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Draco. What brings
you out on such a fine Spring
evening? Or is it Summer?
Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.

Who else is here? I heard you

DUMBLEDORE
I often talk aloud to myself. I
find it extraordinarily useful.
That which sounds sane at a
whisper can seem utterly mad when
said for all the world to hear.
Haven’t been whispering to
yourself, have you, Draco?
Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease.
DUMBLEDORE
You are not an assassin, Draco.
MALFOY
How do you know what I am? I’ve
done things that would shock you.
DUMBLEDORE
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping
she would, in turn, bear a cursed
necklace to me? Like replacing a
bottle of mead with one laced with
poison. Forgive me, Draco, but
these are attempts so feeble I
cannot help but question if your
heart has been really in them.
I’m curious. When Voldemort gave
you this task, when he asked you
to kill me, was it in a whisper?
He trusts me!

MALFOY
I was chosen!

Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls back his sleeve and
reveals the DARK MARK. Dumbledore barely looks at it.
DUMBLEDORE
Then I shall make it easy for you.
Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand.
Instantly Malfoy raises his own.

trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows.

Harry peers up, eyes flashing angrily at the sound of
Bellatrix’s voice. He draws his wand slowly.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think
introductions are in order.
BELLATRIX
Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid
we’re on a bit of a tight
schedule.

Do it.
Malfoy’s wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,
aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW
splinters through the columns to his right. He looks,
finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.
Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a
finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
Silent. A ghost again.
GREYBACK
He doesn’t have the stomach. Like
his father. Let me finish him.
In my own way.
BELLATRIX
No! The Dark Lord was clear. The

Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to
make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s arm
rises.
SNAPE
Avada Kedavra!
A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the
chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the
ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.
HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking
Harry’s cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT,
mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s
arm drops limply to his side.
SNAPE
You can no longer stay here.
Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by
the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then
follows.
Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the
ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers
down. Agony wrecks Harry’s face and he has to steady
himself. He looks up into the leering skull above. Rage
fills his eyes.

solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY
BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a

SNAPE
Go on!
NEW ANGLE - HARRY
Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in
his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and
black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely
lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
and takes aim again.
HARRY
Cruciatus!
Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.
HARRY
Incacerata!
Once again, Snape deflects the spell.
HARRY
Impedimenta!
Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.
Harry drops his arm in frustration.
Fight!

HARRY
Fight back, you coward!

With staggering quickness, Snape’s wand whips forth and
Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.
SNAPE
Don’t ever associate that word and
my name again.
Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand
when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into
the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.
No!

Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.
Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.

Harry goes still.

His eyes shift, meet Snape’s.

SNAPE
You may have gotten your mother’s

Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining
Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming
ruins of Hagrid’s Hut. They head for the darkness of the
treeline. And VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the
ground, then stops.
HARRY

Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its
hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard
SMOKING.

Hagrid goes still.

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MIDDLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn
and watch the throng of students part for Harry and
Hagrid.
Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry
pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his
face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon
spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered
cheek.
Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen
hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his
body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps
forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls
on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks
on. Understands all.
McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly
the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and
staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As
CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING

Dumbledore’s wand.

Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and
bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a
strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb
lightly over the wood, transfixed, when...

*
*
*
*

... McGonagall enters.

Potter.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes
drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She
frowns, trying to call forth some words.

*
*

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Potter, in light of what’s

Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words

Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks
