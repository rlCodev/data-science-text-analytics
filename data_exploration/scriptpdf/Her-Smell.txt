INTERLUDE #1 (5 YEARS AGO)
GRAINY VHS HOME MOVIE FOOTAGE: Becky, Mari and Ali are
laughing, happy, young, giddy and supportive. All reaching
aggressively for a copy of SPIN MAGAZINE, tearing it in
excitement, laughing, smiling. The camera zooms in on it.
You see the cover: the three of them are on it. Headline
reads: “SOMETHING SHE. Back and ready to conquer.”
BECKY
What have we here? Oh just some
bullshit magazine.
MARI
There’s the infamous Becky Something,
Ali van der Wolff and the craggy witch
Marielle Hell. Back and ready to
conquor.
ALI
Major label corporate whores! Sell out
bitches get on the cover of magazines!
BECKY
Oh, is that me?
MARI
Would you sign out magazine for us
please?
BECKY
That’s me. On my magazine cover. We
look pretty cool.
MARI
It’s pretty fuckin’ cool.
Beaming, laughing, smiling. Not the good times: Great Times.
ACT ONE: BLUE&GREEN/STEADICAM (The Present)

INT. THE VENUE, BEHIND THE STAGE - NIGHT
This is a story that hums like neon and moves like
electricity and reverberates like an echo. Lights flash:
disorienting, rhythmic and eerie. They bring with them
cheering (all female voices). The strobing lights slow down
enough to illuminate three Hard Women.
They stand in a battle-ready position, bathed in different
color lights from every direction, blinking on/off. An
electric haze of mismatched bulbs, signs, spotlights,
reflections consolidated into a haze of color.

1

2.
The crowd’s chanting is rising and rising.
CROWD
BECKY. BECKY. BECKY. BECKY.
Center: BECKY SOMETHING. Peroxide blonde, smeared everything
on her face from the preceding hour of show. Sweaty hair
smashed to forehead. Glitter all over her face.
Becky Something is a rock goddess nearing the end of her
reign at the top. You can see in her glassy half-gone eyes
that Becky is doped up.
Becky ticks her head back and forth in rhythm to people
chanting her name, closes her eyes, really digs it, throws up
a pair of middle fingers to the ladies flanking her.
BECKY
(under breath, quietly)
I always flirt with death.
On one side: MARIELLE HELL. Bass. (Mari, casually.) Mari is
super chill, dark, mysterious, smoking, half the mess that
Becky is and with none of the hang ups. The long term
relationship with her girlfriend is proof that she can
succeed as a fun time drug user rock star where Becky cannot.
The other side: ALI VAN DER WOLFF. Drums. Dependable, sane,
sober. Ali keeps the rhythm and the band on track. She
handles business while Mari and Becky are using. Ali is fun,
devoid of her partners darkness and perpetually has that joy
denied her by the sinking ship she is stuck on, with no life
preserver.
BECKY (CONT’D)
(under breath/halfsinging)
I always flirt with death.
The crowd still chants and when the fever pitch has been
reached, Becky, Ali and Mari storm the stage to cheers.
Encore time at last. Becky steps into the spotlight, a halo
forming around her from the bright hair.
All three have fans blowing their hair, adding to the
dramatic effect. Behind them is a banner with the band’s name
and logo: SOMETHING SHE.

THE VENUE, THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS
BECKY
It’s not over. No. I’m not fuckin’
finished. You know this one.

3.
BECKY (CONT'D)
You love it. You want it. I always
flirt with death!
(singing, no backup)
I always flirt with death.
I look ill but I don’t care about it.
Becky looks to Ali and Mari, Ali gives a drumstick countdown.
Becky takes it from the top. Rough, raw and beautiful:
grinding rock sung with feminine aggression. Crowd goes nuts.
(It is ‘Another Girl, Another Planet’ by The Only Ones.)
BECKY (CONT’D)
(singing)
I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don’t care about it
I can face your threats and stand up
Straight and tall and shout about it
I think I’m on another world with you
With you.
I’m on another planet with you
You get under my skin
I don’t find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won’t need rehabilitating oh no
I think I’m on another world with you
With you
I’m on another planet with you.
Another girl. Another planet.
Another girl. Another planet.
Becky’s drugged out/stage adrenaline euphoria is a thing to
behold as she sings, snarls and wails on her guitar. Mari
looks cool as anything, cigarette dangling as she plays bass.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Space travel’s in my blood
There ain’t nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out
But I don’t care anything about it.
I think I’m on another world with you
With you
I’m on another planet with you.
Another girl, who’se loving you now?
Another planet, is holding you down.
Another planet.
Here, on stage, you see the extent to which Becky fancies
herself a god. Not a rock god(dess) but an actual,
untouchable, invincible god.

4.
Becky is way lost in her illusions but the band sounds great.
She holds it together when get sloppy and she misses a note
or word here or there.
The song ends and Becky drops her guitar. Screeching feedback
wails as the crowd goes nuts and she stumbles, dizzy and
headsick, off the stage banging into things and colliding
with the wall and twirling. (Feedback continues....)
3

THE VENUE, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

3

Follow from behind as Becky stumbles down a long, fluorescent
lit corridor with humming and buzzing lights everywhere and
the ringing of feedback and crowd sounds fading slowly,
though the feedback lingers because it’s in her head too.
Becky is light headed from a combination of exhaustion, a
head rush, adrenaline all augmented with dope. KAT, an
assistant, appears from nowhere to give her water and a towel
to wipe face and sweat. She uses it to half deliberately
smear her makeup even further. Becky gives no fucks.
You see the way the silent assistant treats Becky: eggshells
at all times. Becky throws the towel at Kat as Mari catches
up, gives them a knowing nod and flicks her cigarette away.
Kat is gone like a whisp of smoke as Mari and Becky duck into
a dressing room that says ‘SOMETHING SHE’ on the door and
close it mostly, open just a crack.
MARI
I am a free woman. No more fuckin’
tour.
(ref: Wayne’s World)
Party time!
Excellent!

BECKY

MARI
Right this way my pretty.
Ali catches up to the door and looks in the crack, watching
her bandmates pour booze and remove little foil packages of
drugs. Ali brushes her own sweaty hair back as Kat reappears
with a bottle of water. Clean living Ali.
Kat is now also holding a baby of like 1 1/2. She stands next
to Ali and peers into the door crack as well. Ali looks away
from the door to Kat, at the baby, full of agonizing sadness
for the life Becky has created for it.

5.
ALI
Sorry, Kat. I’ll take her. Did she
eat?
KAT
An hour ago.
Ali holds Becky’s baby, lovingly, tenderly.
ALI
Hello baby. Mommy’s busy right now so
aunt Ali’s gonna play with you.
Kat hands over some forms, paperwork.
KAT
The venue needs these signed.
ALI
I’ll handle it.
Ali sticks an arm out and Kat wedges them under. Ali walks
with the baby to the next dressing room down.
4

THE VENUE, ALI’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

4

Ali catches her reflection in the mirror and puts down the
paperwork. It’s clear that the sight of herself holding a
baby gives her a rise and she holds for a moment. It’s a
quiet lull before Hurricane Becky storms in just as Ali
starts to sign the official forms on behalf of the band.
Ali sees Becky come in to this room via the mirror and now
Becky is twice as gauzy as before and has a half crazy half
disoriented look on her face as she goes right for the baby.
BECKY
There’s my little princess Tama. Momma
missed you. Momma missed you!
Ali instinctually hesitates, holds the baby away which makes
Becky give her a confused, lost look but then it passes and
Ali hands the baby to Becky, who deeply loves her. Becky
holds Tama, kisses her, but Becky herself is such a sloppy
looking mess that as Ali steps back to watch it, there’s
something painfully tragic and hopeless about this messed up
Madonna and child tableau that Ali wants to scream.
BECKY (CONT’D)
There she is, the princess. Danny
brought her?

6.
ALI
I don’t know. Kat had her.
BECKY
Danny’s not here?
ALI
Haven’t seen him.
BECKY
Did he not see the show and is Ya-Ema
here?
ALI
Beck. C’mon. I don’t know.
Becky is mile a minute. Ali has to keep up. Here’s the
pattern with Becky: she has next to no idea about the world
around her, her awareness is dim and nothing gets through.
Kat enters. Nervous, always ready to be yelled at.
KAT
There you are.
BECKY
Here the fuck am I but where’s Danny’s
where’s Ya-Ema?
KAT
Danny’s saying goodbye to people. Ali
has forms the venue wanted signBECKY
And was she with him?
She was.

KAT

BECKY
(to nobody)
I want her away from my kid.
(as if a new girlfriend is worse than this squalor.)
BECKY (CONT’D)
Now is he gonna come pick her up
tonight or am I supposed to or what’s
happening because we have that thing
tomorrow so he’ll have to come pick
her up first thing in the AY-EM.
(yelling)
Ya-Ema! You here? Show yourself!

7.
KAT
I assumed you worked it out with him.
BECKY
That’s not true. That’s not true. I
hadn’t worked it out. That’s not true.
An imposing, strikingly handsome black man appears in the
room. He is YA-EMA, Becky’s shaman/spiritual guru of
indistinct beliefs. He is dressed in mystical ways: a big
amulet around his neck, some sort of a curious hat.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Ya-Ema, darling! Becky need guidance.
YA-EMA
(nodding, confident)
Dymoke prepares.
BECKY
(to Ali)
Time to exit this realm for a spell.
If you see anything you identify as a
pollutant to the energy of this space
our mortal husks occupy let us KNOW so
we can purge it while we have all the
tools and the KNOW HOW to save us. YaEma onward! C’mere Tama.
They exit, Ya-Ema and Ali giving a distrusting look. Becky
isn’t making sense, obviously, and the casualness with which
she carries Tama makes Ali and Kat really nervous.
KAT
What’s his deal?
ALI
She calls him Ya-Ema but I think his
real name is Alvin. We call him
Sauron.

THE VENUE, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - THAT SAME MOMENT

5

Becky has Tama down in a chair and is at the mirror, looking
at herself with total satisfaction. Not a ‘what am I doing
messed up on drugs while I have my baby?’ moment. Becky half
wipes and makes messier-therefor-cooler her makeup. Glitter
in her hair and everything now. Pretty rad look, actually.
Behind her, Ya-Ema’s helper DYMOKE has arranged the making of
a seance with burning things, a pot of some witch-like
origin, crystals, potions, things to drink. The works. The
origin of their beliefs are vague. Voodoo? Zulu? Flim flam.

8.
Becky sits and we have a pause, a lull for an eternal three
seconds. Ya-Ema holds out a hand to her.
The item?

YA-EMA

Becky produces a photograph and an item of jewelry. Ya-Ema
hands them to Dymoke who places them at the center of the
ceremonial table. This shit is weird. Dymoke rubs some sort
of powder on the objects and lights candles around them.
DYMOKE
We purge the essence of invasive
forces from this place.
Becky closes her eyes and takes Ya-Ema’s hand. She buys
whatever this is 110%. She is focused and at peace. This
peace is ruined by a knock/enter which stirs her and in walks
DANNY and a young pretty girl named TIFFANY.
BECKY
What’s she DOING here, can’t you see
this is a fucking religious ceremony
and you have to respect that?
Danny doesn’t respect or buy Ya-Ema at all. He ignores him.
DANNY
Good show tonight.
BECKY
You’re a liar. You didn’t see it.
TIFFANY
Don’t call people liars, Becky, unless
you know they’re lying.
BECKY
I’m sorry was anybody speaking to you
Lil’ Miss Tiff-a-knee? Tiffany.
Tiffany! I can’t believe you’re
raising our daughter around a woman
named Tiffany. Tiff-ant the pissant.
TIFFANY
You’re an angel.
BECKY
True. It’s all true!
(sticks tongue out, makes
a thhhhhp noise)
DANNY
Can you excuse us?

9.
BECKY
Excuse us, Tiff.
Tiffany looks at the seance table. She picks up the
photograph and holds it: it is of her.
TIFFANY
The fuck...where did you get these?
DYMOKE
Ya-Ema requested items to envision the
purity of people whose auras we must
to investigate before Mistress Becky
allows them around the child.
TIFFANY
(to Danny)
Is this for real?
DANNY
(hemming and hawing)
...it’s important that she feel safe
when Tama is with us. That’s all.
TIFFANY
So you put a curse on me?
BECKY
We didn’t curse you yet and we
probably won’t unless Ya-Ema sees
something in the smoke that you he
doesn’t like.
TIFFANY
This is sick. You’re sick.
DANNY
That’s not helping. Just - can you
just - give us a minute.
BECKY
(like a game show host)
Gooooooooodbye Tiffaneeeeee!
Tiffany exits swiftly, super angry, and Becky throws a fist
full of snacks at the wall behind her.
DANNY
Don’t be such a cunt, Beck.

10.
BECKY
C-U-N-T! Everyone’s accusing me!
(to the tune of the
Ramones “D-U-M-B /
Everyone’s accusing me”
from ‘Pinhead’)
Danny goes to Tama, rubs her head lovingly and lowers by her
side. Becky is way zonked and getting tired. The rush of
finishing a show and the rush of drugs after finishing a show
winds down. Ya-Ema and Dymoke sit like statues, watching,
quietly.
Ya-Ema nods once. This is all you can get from him.
DYMOKE
We must resume the ritual.
BECKY
Yeah we must so what can we do ya for,
Dan-O?
DANNY
I wanted you to see her. It shouldn’t
be this difficult.
BECKY
Why would I want to see Tiffany? Yuck!
(barfing noises)
DANNY
See your child. Unless you’d rather
walk out on her, too. In which caseBecky bumbles to Tama. Danny lifts her before Becky arrives.
DANNY (CONT’D)
How can you let yourself be like this
around her?
BECKY
(real loopy)
Listen man I’m working and you’d said
Tuesday not Friday which so how am I
supposed to keep track if you keep
changing your mind?
DANNY
I thought you’d want to see her before
going to Europe.
BECKY
You-rup I-rup we all rup for Eu-rope.

11.
Becky is moving around, taking off accessories and pieces of
theatricality from the show. She doesn’t hold still at all as
she kicks off boots, de layers sweaty dirty clothing. Within
a minute of this quite serious conversation, she’s down to a
bra, necklaces, tight pants. Ya-Ema and Dymoke respect her
rituals and face forward, completely unmoving from the
direction of the table.
DANNY
Oh. I forgot. You’re not going to
Europe. Did you know that?
BECKY
Of course I knew.
DANNY
You didn’t act like I was wrong when I
said it.
BECKY
I was testing you there’s no European
tour I’d know if there was.
You would?

DANNY

BECKY
Because I’d have packed a bag which as
you can see clearly I have not.
Becky motions to an area on the floor that, to her total
confusion and surprise, does contain a packed bag.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Whoooooa. What’s that!
DANNY
You’re a mess.
BECKY
No you’re a mess. No you’re a mess.
DANNY
Okay Becky.
Instead of engaging, Becky has begun reapplying her makeup in
the mirror because with the show over, she is on her way to
the after party all night.
Mari enters, nearly as buzzed as Becky but not quite. At
least, she wears it better. Her girlfriend, LAUREN, is with
her and she looks incredibly stylish in a non rock n roll
way. More slick. They are wrapped around one another.

12.
MARI
Danny boy.
(singing)
The pipes the pipes are calling. From
glenn to glenn and down the mountain
siiiiiide.
DANNY
Mari. You seem...well.
He is wryly joking because she is all fucked up too. But her
outfit (changed from the show, ready to party) and general
demeanor are sharper and more hip than messy Becky.
LAUREN
We ready to rock?
Becky has put on a ‘clean’ top (stained/tattered) and is
doing something to her hair which could be called abuse.
BECKY
Laurie baby! We just finished rocking.
Rocking and a rolling! The only
problem is I did not get to visit the
other place with Ya-Ema because ol’
Dan-O came in and interrupted my
spiritual journey it was postponed so
we’ve still got that to tend to
because you know that I’m not myself
if I don’t get a moment to visit other
realities where the fuck is my
lighter.
Danny hurts to see this. He holds Tama close. Becky is barely
present on this plane of reality right now.
DANNY
(to Mari)
Why would you let her do this?
MARI
Not the fuckin’ baby sitter, mate.
BECKY
Why? Why? B-E-C-K-Whyyyy? Because I
gotta!
MARI
Hey man don’t discriminate against
whatever gives people spiritual
balance. That’s like f-f-fucked up.
BECKY
Hello exactly!

13.
Becky hi-fives Dymoke. Ya-Ema leaves her hanging for a second
before giving a reluctant hi-five. Mari slides for a hi-five.
DANNY
You’ll hate yourself forever if you
miss these years with her.
LAUREN
Heavy shit, Dirtbag Danny.
DANNY
Nobody calls me that anymore.
MARI
(mock radio DJ voice)
This is the Night Show with DJ Dirtbag
Danny, playing all the dirty nasty
rock you can only hear after dark!
DANNY
Becky. Becky?
Mari goes to Becky to show off/examine something secret in
Mari’s little drug carrying pouch. Danny, disgusted by this
affront to responsibility, takes Tama and exits the dressing
room and we follow him. Lauren is ice cold when he looks to
her for some support or validation. She shrugs, blankly.
6

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

6

Danny walks down the corridor looking for Tiffany. The door
to Ali’s dressing room is open. He sticks his head in.
Ali is doing her balanced post show ritual: washing her face
with scrub, drinking a warm herbal tea and other treatments
for a quality exhausting life. She too has changed from her
show outfit to something more sloppy and casual, but still
very cool and stylish. The forms are signed and neatly back
in their folder, which Kat is exiting with as Danny lands.
Hey.
7

DANNY

THE VENUE, ALI’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Danny lingers in the door.
DANNY
You seen Tiffany?
ALI
Just you, Danny boy.

7

14.
Danny steps in, carrying stress and negativity with his body.
ALI (CONT’D)
You shouldn’t come around and see her
like this.
DANNY
What choice do I have? I’m the loser
who always crawls back.
ALI
Twice she fired me from this tour and
forgot about it the next morning. We
all crawl back.
DANNY
How much does she pay the shaman?
ALI
We’re not sure. In all likelihood, the
answer would upset you and me both.
DANNY
How’s business?
ALI
Euro tour’s cancelled. But I guess you
already knew that. They’re opening the
vaults for an EP or something.
DANNY
She’s gonna fuck this up for all of
us. It doesn’t end well.
ALI
Don’t be so negative, dude. What’s it
about? You need cash?
DANNY
Tama needs more than I can give. Becky
has to take responsibility.
They share a brief, quiet moment. Ali looks at Tama, who she
really does love. Her hand reaches out slowly.
May I?

ALI

Danny offers Tama to Ali, the opposite of protecting her
around Becky.

15.
ALI (CONT’D)
Howard might cancel the dates we’re
holding for the new record. He knows
we’re not ready.
DANNY
What does that mean?
ALI
It means I hope you’ve got a plan B to
put this one in private school.
DANNY
She in breech? Do I need to talk to
somebody?
ALI
Our lawyer’s got it all sorted. I
dunno. No one’s really expecting much
of her at this point.
Ali sits down with Tama. Weary, from the show and cradles
Tama’s head, lovingly. Danny gets close, and the two of them,
holding Tama, it’s almost like a portrait of an actual
functional family.
Ali catches Danny looking at her and thinking this very
thought. Her look lets on a lot: before Becky, Ali and Danny
were involved. There’s a linger here. Ali breaks away.
DANNY
She handed me my walking papers and
seven months later hands me Tama. Ever
since then my life’s been a nightmare.
In some ways.
ALI
Um, wow. Heavy, man. My fault. I
thought you two would be a match made
in heaven.
DANNY
Don’t listen to me. I shouldn’t be
here.
ALI
DJ Dirtbag Danny used to roll hard.
DANNY
Don’t desire being a damn dirtbag come
forty. I’m putting down roots for my
daughter. I bought WABK for her
future.

16.
ALI
They’re opening the vaults for an EP
or something. Sorry, did I say that
already? Because you know, a contract
is a contract?
DANNY
‘Lies’ is deeply underrated.
ALI
You used to love her.
Becky enters, forcefully. It’s obvious that in the interval,
she took another hit of something strong and unnecessary to
repair her lagging energy. She isn’t doing so well with
standing up straight and is giddy, light headed and daffy.
She looks at Tama like Tama is the devil.
BECKY
I want her out of here.
Danny sort of blocks her from getting to Tama.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Hey get the fuck outta my way.
DANNY
Christ Beck, don’t talk like that.
What’s got into you?
BECKY
She has to go. She has to go now.
DANNY
You can’t be serious.
Dymoke and Ya-Ema enter, obviously having had to chase Becky.
BECKY
We saw it in the smoke. ‘The child
will be your downfall.’ Tell them, YaEma. TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW!!
She is shrieking. Ya-Ema looks afraid, like he has lost
control of Becky. He looks at Danny with calm eyes.
YA-EMA
I did not decree this.

17.
BECKY
You did you did you did you did! You
saw a prophecy and when we were in the
Other Place you told me that the child
will be my downfall so we’ve got a lit
stick a’ dyn-O-MITE that needs tossing
out the tank.
DANNY
This is your child you’re talking
about. Please. Be reasonable.
Becky grabs for Tama and Danny sees the fear and insanity in
her eyes. It’s nutty. He protects Tama.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Can we take a minute? Ya-Emu, calm her
down somehow? Do whatever it is you
do.
Ya-Ema and Dymoke come to Becky, apprehensive, but it’s clear
she trusts them. They hold her head. She closes her eyes and
falls back into their arms. They carry her to the couch and
lay her down. There’s silence, and people wonder if the worst
is over. Calm for a moment.
DYMOKE
Mistress Becky! Look at my Ting.
Becky looks at his amulet and then breaths deep and slowly.
DYMOKE (CONT’D)
Tell us what you see.
BECKY
I see The Void of Eternity.
YA-EMA
(chanting)
Ammmmmm nahhhhhhh.
Ammmmmm nahhhhhhh.
Becky opens her eyes and sits up. It’s insane: like she is a
different person. Still messed up but fear of Tama is gone.
BECKY
(to Tama)
Hello baby. Mommy missed you.
Danny looks at Becky like she is dangerous. He doesn’t know
how to proceed dealing with her right now. He tries normal.

18.
DANNY
Ali said you’re doing an EP instead of
a full record.
BECKY
Yeah who knows I mean it might not
even happen. Like it probably won’t
work out or anything even though some
of the ‘92 sessions we dug up are
powerful and maybe a track or two from
earlier that I’d forgotten.
Becky pulls Ali down into her lap. Her energy is all over the
place and totally toxic to Danny and Ali. Ya-Ema and Dymoke
are in a trance, as if trying to control Becky’s mind.
Enter HOWARD GOODMAN, the manager, (50). His life is defined
by trying to stay afloat and stay one step ahead.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Howard. How-ard you tonight? Good show
huh?
HOWARD
They love you. And I love that they
love you. Danny. What’s happening?
DANNY
Holding it together. You wouldn’t
understand.
Sarcasm. They both sort of nod like, yeah, right, ha ha.
HOWARD
Becky, Zelda is waiting.
BECKY
Ah fuck it I forgot. What’s that bitch
want?
Mari and Lauren enter.
Easy now.

MARI

BECKY
Stuck up holier than thou too good for
it all wench.
LAUREN
Why don’t you tell us how you really
feel?

19.
BECKY
Yeah whatever what does she want?
HOWARD
Express regards. Cheer. Celebratory
remarks? She said you were great
tonight.
BECKY
Did she come only with fucking obvious
things I already know or what of
course I was great I’m always great so
don’t be late.
HOWARD
I believe I saw her with an olive
branch. Would I lead you astray?
BECKY
(rolling her eyes)
Nooooo Howarrrrd you wouldn’t.
HOWARD
Do it for me. She’s not lying. You
were great tonight.
Becky looks to Ya-Ema and Dymoke for consultation.
DYMOKE
She brings negativity.
BECKY
You see! What is Zelda E. Zekial
coming and doing here anyways coming
backstage at our show when where I am
spending qual-ah-tee time with my
family and demand an audience?
ALI
Chill out with that, okay girl?
Zelda’s alright.
BECKY
Okay FINE I’ve decided to go. Where is
she Howard, and while we’re on the
topic can you please tell me are we
doing those recordings at R-Trax like
last time because I can’t get a
straight answer on the matter.
Becky prances about triumphantly when saying this last part.
The room is cramped: Ali, Mari, Lauren, Becky, Danny, Tama,
Howard.

20.
All obstacles for Becky to shimmy around and out of the room.
Everybody follows her like the Pied Piper except Ya-Ema and
Dymoke, who we leave behind for now.
HOWARD
Of course. Anything you need.
Becky throws her arm around Howard as they exit the room.

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

BECKY
That’s because you understand me don’t
you! I can’t count on anybody cah-rist
what kind of world is this where we
don’t even have the straight
information about whether or not we
are like making an album nobody is
helping me write or some E fucking P
with just I don’t know, an acoustic
guitar? Can somebody please help Dear
Howard and give me an answer and
please make it an honest one!
HOWARD
Let’s say hello to Zelda and I’ll
confirm this while you’re with her.
She’s excited to see everybody.
BECKY
We’re all going? Why didn’t you say
so! I don’t wanna do it alone. To me,
my X-Women!
Becky leads Mari (sort of digging this) and Ali (dying
inside) down the corridor. Lauren follows. Howard stops a
ways back with Danny. Stay with them as the ladies walk away.
HOWARD
To your right then on the left.
BECKY
To the right and to the left and to
the right and to the left...
Howard, Danny and Tama. Quiet after a whirlwind. Deep breath.
DANNY
I wish I had your patience.
HOWARD
I’m a communicator. I communicate.
How’s she doing?

21.
He lovingly pats Tama.
DANNY
Good. She’s good.
HOWARD
How’re you doing?
DANNY
She turned her back and walked away
ninety nine times. I need an even
hundred. You ever have a bad habit you
just can’t quit?
HOWARD
No. But hey: you know who does?
They both laugh. A sad, tender moment between the men who
suffer for Becky. Howard’s eyes are full of empathy.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Anything I can do?
DANNY
Help her. That’ll help me.
Howard looks down the hall at where Zelda’s room is.
HOWARD
I’m trying. I’m always trying.

THE VENUE, GREEN ROOM - THAT SAME MOMENT

9

Becky, Ali and Mari burst into a room with snacks and
whatnot. In it is ZELDA E. ZEKIAL, smoking, looking cool and
fashionable. She faces down the three amigos in the door
(Lauren hangs back just a little). Becky enters dancing,
annoyingly singing a song. Mari claps for the beat.
Zelda is in with the cool crowd, the art crowd. (Like Kate
Bush/St. Vincent/PJ Harvey.) Her hair is outrageous and
exciting and her makeup is glam. Becky resents her deeply.
BECKY
(clapping)
Miss Ezekial don’t get no bones...
Ezekial don’t got no tones...
And here’s the word of the lord.
Well the finger bones connected to the
hand bone
(middle fingers up, Mari
joins in singing now)
(MORE)

22.
BECKY (CONT'D)
The hand bone’s connected to the fuck
bone
The fuck bone’s connected to the butt
bone.
(Becky aggressively rubs
her butt on and around
Zelda’s head/shoulders.)
And that’s the turd of the lord.
Zelda brushes Becky’s butt away and fixes her awesome hair.
ZELDA
Great show, Beck.
BECKY
Easy for you to say from the comfort
of that chair.
Zelda looks down, bummed that this is going to be one of
“those” Becky conversations.
ZELDA
Ladies. Brilliant work.
Ali gives Zelda a friendly hug/air kiss hello. Mari gives her
a much more intimate kiss. They were briefly a thing.
ALI
Hey there babe.
MARI
Zee Zee. Sweetie. This is Lauren, my
love.
ZELDA
You’re a beauty.
LAUREN
C’mon. Mari’s told me all about you.
BECKY
I CAN JUST GO if you all want some
alone time.
ALI
Hey, chill.
BECKY
I agree let’s all of us just take it
down a notch and take stock of the
situation.
Becky sits, mockingly overly proper and business like.

23.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Zelda darling what to do we owe the
pleasure of your visitation?
ZELDA
You guys are killers. The new shit for
myself.
Zelda is cool as a cucumber and cold as ice. Drags her
cigarette.
MARI
What’d ya think?
ZELDA
I’m green with envy.
MARI
Thanks, doll.
Becky jumps up and starts rummaging around the snack area and
lightly stuffing her face.
ZELDA
Howard said that you guys are almost
wrapping this one up-BECKY
Yeah I don’t know. Whatever. I’m not
really feeling the stage life right
now, ya get me? I dunno why do you
ask.
ZELDA
(eyes at Mari and Ali)
I’ve got a string of dates coming up.
Want to see if guys would be
interested in joining.
Pregnant pause. Becky freezes. Mari and Ali brace for impact.
BECKY
Um I dunno Z-grade. What, you mean
like opening act for you? Hardly makes
sense don’t ya think? What is this,
six years ago? Oh wait if it was six
years ago you’d be opening for M. E.
me and you’de be trying to run off
with this one.
Points to Mari. No shame. Becky is buzzing about like a
nervous bird, touching everything and moving things around.

24.
ALI
When are the dates?
BECKY
What are the dates?
Becky pauses. She nearly chokes on rage and sadness. She
takes a short, Becky-sized moment to regain herself.
BECKY (CONT’D)
How about a simple ‘no thanks’ and
also thanks for the gesture of coming
here to personally bitch slap us in
all our faces. Nah. We do rock music
to rock people and didn’t I hear that
on your last record didn’t even have
any guitars??
(mock snoring noises)
Zelda stands, graceful and elegant, and takes a tiny bird
like bite of the snacks Becky has made a mess of.
ZELDA
End of the winter. March ish.
BECKY
Don’t fuckin’ talk to her. Don’t even
look at her. Here’s an idea. How about
you march-ish right out of the room
into your limousine and take that
fuckin’ offer with you? We need a
break, not a tour. I mean, we just
finished this one like an hour ago so
who’se interested in another tour not
me that’s who.
ZELDA
You brought me on my first tour, Beck,
and I’ll never forget it. I’m not your
enemy. I never was despite what you
thought happened at that festival
thing. You gonna make me beg to get
you to bury the hatchet?
BECKY
Uh your music used to be awesome and
now it sucks so I don’t want to tour
with you and now you’ve come to bury
me. I speak for everybody when I say
that there is zero interest in
retreading the past which includes
your fabled tour.
(MORE)

25.
BECKY (CONT'D)
I’m trying to move for-ward here, not
backwards and that means I don’t wanna
slip down your bill. Don’t you have
like the next generation of pansy art
rock babes dying to share your light
so why don’t you ask one a’ them. My
answer is no and where I go they go.
Motioning to Ali and Mari, both mortified, silent and sad.
LAUREN
I should go.
BECKY
Stay PUH-lease I feel like we’re done
here.
ZELDA
(wry, smiling)
You’re one of a kind, Beck.
BECKY
You got that right, a true original,
stick to your guns and your roots and
never buy into the BS just the Becky
Something, that’s what I always say. PU-R-E spells Becky and PEE-YOU spells
Zelda.
Zelda cannot process the aggravation, having come here to do
something nice and have it thrown back at her so angrily.
Howard appears with an optimistic smile on his face.
HOWARD
So! Do we have a deal?
BECKY
Howard how could you? I trusted you
and you set me up!
HOWARD
I thought you might feel this way but
hear us out.
ZELDA
It’s not what you’re thinking. It’s
not clubs. It’s theaters. An intimate-BECKY
BORING. Pass!

26.
ZELDA
I’m sorry that--BECKY
Oh my god if you aren’t going to leave
I will. I have an interrupted journey
to complete and by the way you’re all
being incredibly rude to Ya-Ema and
the spiritual calm he requires.
(to Howard)
I am not done with you. You’re in big
trouble.
Becky storms out. The room takes a moment to catch it’s
breath. Don’t shit talk the hand that feeds you.
Ali looks back at the door where Becky exited. Zelda is
perceptive, deceptively so. Sly, eyes narrowing.
ZELDA
“Having fun in Beckytown.”
ALI
Whatever could you mean?
ZELDA
Say it. Cut the “B.S.”
MARI
There’s nothing.
Ali wants to stay. Mari takes comfort in Lauren’s hands.
Howard looks a little disappointed, but not really.
ZELDA
Who’se Ya-Ema?
ALI
Sauron, the all seeing guru.
Mari and Lauren smile. They are fascinated by Becky’s weird
relationship with Ya-Ema.
I’ll go.

ZELDA

ALI
I...think that might be for the best?
HOWARD
I’m so sorry. Worth a shot, though?
Maybe we take another swing when she’s
not so...so...I can’t find the word.

27.
ZELDA
Door’s open and I’m all ears. You used
to pack places twice this size. What
happened?
ALI
Canceling tours twice at the last
minute has untested side effects.
ZELDA
I wouldn’t know.
MARI
It’ll be fine.
ZELDA
And if it isn’t?
MARI
It’ll be fine.
Zelda studies them. She is very sharp, respectable and
impeccable. The scuzziness of this place, this level of filth
and revelry is years behind her. She looks at Mari and Ali
like abused children, afraid to speak out.
Zelda puts on her very nice jacket and a stylish hat.
ZELDA
If you change your mind--Becky bursts back into the room like Kramer. She has had
another hit of whatever she is on and is all wired up and now
has Tama with her. Danny and Tiffany trail behind, panicked.
Ya-Ema and Dymoke are there as well.
BECKY
Holy smoking crap you’re still here?
Zelda has left zee building. Take a
hint! The Legend of Zelda A Stink to
the Ass must come to an E-N-D if you
please.
ZELDA
I’m leaving. Don’t overreact.
BECKY
I hardly think I’m overreacting just
normal react.
She is wired, unwell, fraying at all edges. Like a bee,
buzzing around and you couldn’t swat her if you tried.

28.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I mean, Zelda, baby, like excuse me
for being so fuckin’ naive but how
dare you invade this space?
HOWARD
It was entirely my idea. Don’t blame
her.
Becky motions to Ya-Ema and Dymoke, cleansing the air with
some sort of burning reed, purifying the room for her.
ZELDA
I’m leaving. Peel it the fuck down.
Zelda makes for the exit, waving away Ya-Ema’s smoke. She and
Mari exchange an intimate look. A little silent side story
plays out with Zelda saying bye to Mari, Ali and Howard while
Danny and Becky engage on the other side of the room.
DANNY
Let me take her.
BECKY
What no. Get away from me? Dymoke
needs to purify her weren’t you
listening?
DANNY
You shouldn’t be holding her in the
state you’re in.
BECKY
What state is that Dan-O? The state of
rage or the state of New York I don’t
know where I am anymore you dumb
fuckin’ clown, ha ha!
She tries to hold Tama away and moves from Danny but trips
and falls, forward, managing to spin quickly landing on her
back, Tama up in the air.
People rush in, freaking out. Becky is on the ground laughing
and holding Tama.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Wheee that was a fun ride! You wanna
go on another sky ride? With mommy!
Danny grabs Tama. Becky refuses to let go but he gets her.
Tiffany puts her arm around Danny, protective.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Dude chill I’ve got this.

29.
DANNY
Get off her you fucking mess.
There’s black rage in his eyes. He’s finished playing nice.
TIFFANY
I think we need to leave.
HOWARD
Perhaps we should all retreat to our
separate rooms for a bit?
Becky starts rolling on the floor, slowly slinking up, arms
and limbs clumsily draped over the furniture, like a crab.
She reaches for Tama and falls again, at Howard, Mari and
Ali’s feet. They all look afraid and upset.
BECKY
What you two suddenly have nothing to
say? Just watching the show. Ha ha
you’re doing a better job of it than
playing in it that’s for sure. Oh look
at me running my mouth but let’s not
say anything we might regret later.
Hey maybe if you run you can catch up
with Zel-duhhh. She can have you.
She’s easy and boring and no fun isn’t
that what you want?
Mari has been hurting watching this. She and Ali look down at
Becky with lumps in their throats. This pains them, a lot.
ALI
Don’t. Not now. Not with us.
BECKY
Don’t what? Be awesome and show people
a G-O-O-D time?
MARI
Cone on. Please.
Becky stumbles trying to grab Tama. Ya-Ema holds her up.
BECKY
Tough job but somebody’s gotta do it
and I gotta get out of here. I gotta
go to Becky’s room. It stinks of Zelda
shit. So I bid you adeiu and hibbida
hibbida that’s all folks!

30.
She snatches Tama from a shocked Danny and then pushes him,
park bench style, over a chair and he falls to the ground
while she scurries off. This is all happening so fast.
She exits. The room is empty of aggression. Just silent,
shocked faces of people who want so badly to care about her.
Ya-Ema and Tiffany help Danny up.
Seconds pass. It’s very few seconds but after what’s just
happened, it feels like a lot. Time stands still, dissolves
allude to the collapsing of real time and we see, in slow
motion, the devastation wrought by Becky. Hurt feelings,
smashed stuff. Seconds pass like hours in silence.
ALI
I just want to play music in a band.
It breaks the tension. People smile and just as there is
laughter again, the crying of Tama off in the distance sets
them all on high alert. Danny springs into action.
10

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

10

Follow Danny running like mad. Behind him, Ali and Mari,
Lauren, Howard, Tiffany, Ya-Ema and Dymoke. Danny knocks a
chair that is in his way. Kat comes back out of the hallway
when she hears the commotion and joins.
Follow Danny into Becky’s dressing room, his perspective, to
reveal:
11

THE VENUE, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

11

Becky is on the ground, vomit in front of her face and on her
mouth. Bloody forehead. Tama is on the floor crying,
screaming.
It’s not clear exactly what happened and it doesn’t matter.
Danny holds Tama close (Tama is crying: wailing) as Ali and
Mari drop to their knees, right in the vomit, prop Becky up,
start shaking her, throwing water on her. Her eyes flutter.
Fingers into Becky’s throat. Nothing happens. Becky is limp.
Looks are quickly exchanged. Howard runs in, says nothing.
Mari and Ali are breaking out in sweat. Dymoke is quickly
mixing some potion in a thistle and rubs it on Becky’s neck.
Ya-Ema begins to chant, slowly, deep, otherworldly.
YA-EMA
Innnn-connn-immmm
Tama is still crying and crying.

31.
Ali rips off her vomit covered shirt and props it under
Becky’s head, grabs a coke mirror and puts it under her nose
to see if she is breathing. Dymoke’s hands are in the way,
spreading his elixir on her chest.
YA-EMA (CONT’D)
Innnn-connn-immmm
Tama is still crying and crying and crying.
Becky’s eyes flutter faster. She vomits some more onto Ali’s
hands and struggles to open her eyes, to breath, and doesn’t
even try to hold her head up.
YA-EMA (CONT’D)
(chanting)
Innnn-connn-immmm
ALI
Come back Becky. Don’t do this again.
Becky locks eyes with everybody around her, cradled on the
floor like an invalid covered in puke and blood. Silence.
Pausing. Breathing that rises and falls. Anxiety everywhere.
BECKY
(garbled, mouth full of
puke and mucus)
We go way beyond.
Tama’s crying echoes through all of this and it’s awful.
END OF ACT ONE.
INTERLUDE #2 (4 YEARS BEFORE ACT 1)
GRAINY VHS HOME MOVIE FOOTAGE: Becky/Mari/Ali. Full of
positivity, excitement, happiness. The contrast of what we
just saw is shocking. They are holding framed platinum
records for their second album BABY I’M SICK.
ALI
We could get at least a hundred bucks
for these.
MARI
The first and only girl rock band to
sell this many records. I’d like to
say!
BECKY
Two hundred! Nah I’ll keep it. First
and last.
(MORE)

32.
BECKY (CONT'D)
The well of inspiration has run-a dry!
Never gonna make a record this good
again. Good as gold!
They all keep laughing. Becky clumsily drops the framed
record, breaking the glass. She loses it, starts laughing
hysterically. Mari and Ali follow.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Oh shit! We’re never gonna make a
record this good again.
MARI
Howard! We need a new one.
ACT TWO: YELLOW & ORANGE/DOLLY TRACKING SHOTS/ZOOMS
12

INT. RECORDING STUDIO

12

Golden, yellowish brown lights buzz bask this past it’s prime
studio in a ancient haze of wood and history. The place is
laden with signs of the amount of time Becky has spent here
in the sprawling, open ended eight months of recording that
have gone poorly.
Tapestries hang over crystals and other items from Ya-Ema,
shitty candles, no fewer than twenty packed ash trays. The
place is capital D Dingy and Becky the decrepit centerpiece.
Becky is wearing scarves and a threadbare t shirt with one
sleeve nearly gone tucked into skin tight pants. She’d look
iconically cool if she wasn’t so tragic. Her messy ponytail
is a caked with grease, a heart barrette in her hair, her
skin is bad and she feels 1,000% like a goddess.
She poorly makes feeble attempts to strum an acoustic guitar
and sing a weak sounding half finished song. Warbling, barely
making notes and words find one another.
(the song is called Pulled Down and has been written by
Alicia Bognanno/aka Bully)
BECKY
You rotted away
Left to your own mistakes
I never wanted to be the crutch for you
I’m falling behind
With every word you break
I meant to try and piece it back for you
And I’m back to the same shit I was
Drowning in mud
If I’m gonna be pulled down
I’m taking you with

33.
The whole scene is rocky as we pan to the side and see Mari
and Ali. They are behind glass in the booth with Howard and
the distanced hush shows off the tension.
13

RECORDING STUDIO MIXING BOOTH

13

Silently, Ali, Mari and Howard watch Becky, smoke a cigarette
or two of their own and recognize how dead end this feels.
They are holding one another in a protective, loving embrace.
KEITH the engineer mutes her and though Becky still plays,
half assed, they turn so she cannot see and quietly talk,
like Bowman and Poole keeping secrets from HAL9000 in 2001.
HOWARD
I finally understand why you begged me
to stop checking in.
ALI
Fuckin’ bummer. Told you you
shouldn’ta come back.
HOWARD
I had to see for myself who was
occupying this studio I stopped paying
for. Did they not give you the memo?
MARI
Becky decided to pay for it. Shoulda
told you. But didn’t want to. Out of
respect, I guess.
HOWARD
Isn’t that nice of her. I have this
room booked for my new group but it’s
not yet vacated.
ALI
So that’s why you came back.
HOWARD
Did they not tell you you had to
leave?
They did.

ALI

HOWARD
And what did they say?
ALI
I’d rather not repeat it.

34.
HOWARD
If this is the best she has to show
after nine months I’m very screwed.
MARI
To be fair, it’s nine next week so we
still have time to pray for a third
trimester disaster.
ALI
I know you’re out on a limb big time
for us with on this record.
HOWARD
Laid off staff to cover overages?
Mortgage on my beach house? I’m not on
a limb, I’m lying on the ground next
to the damn tree.
ALI
I didn’t know that. I’m sorry.
HOWARD
Releasing their new album this year
would help cover your mess.
Interrupted by Becky, pounding on the window looking mean,
nasty. Throughout, her voice is muted. Sound proofing.
BECKY
What is this. Talk and tea time? Are
we doing a session or a goddamn book
club jesus christ am I the only one
here who cares about the work we’re
doing?
Mari looks right at her but speaks under her breath.
MARI
This is the first day in two weeks she
stayed for longer than an hour.
ALI
And also she came at two.
(Howard checks his watch)
A.M. We’ve been here. She’s in a self
proclaimed groove.
Howard notices how tired and bleary eyed they are and the
massive amount of coffee cups, tea pots and drugs.
Becky storms into the booth, fuming, nostrils flaring and
dripping snot and moisture. Mari and Ali finally detach.

35.
BECKY
Show a’ hands, who is committed to
greatness and will do whatever it
takes to achieve greatness and show of
hands who is lazy and doesn’t care
about this music that we are
recording?
(she raises her hand with
vigor)
That’s one for greatness. Anyone else?
Keith sheepishly raises his hand.
BECKY (CONT’D)
THANK you Keith, nice to know someone
is on my side, the winning side and we
all know who writes history. You all
can go home and take a nap or
something now that your level of
dedication is exposed. Right Howard?
Did you come to check up on your
prized project? Thank you for giving
us space lately but I gotta tell you
I’m sorry but things are going
terribly, at best.
Speechless reactions. Becky is super messed up, sweating,
barely coherent, blind to it all. All four just stare at her.
A quiet pause as we zero in on Becky: see and feel with quiet
dignity the lack of understanding behind her bright blue
eyes, the smoke screen of delusion which she hides behind.
Slow motion. Linger...there is nothing but truth and honesty
on her tired face. She believes every word she says and when
we see Mari, Ali, Howard and Keith, the extent of pity and
sadness for Becky transmits off them. It’s a small moment
that becomes a big moment without announcing itself.
HOWARD
There’s a solution to this. I need to
figure out what it is. Let’s take a
step back and think for a second.
BECKY
That is a graaaand idea. Why can’t
you two be team players like Howard!
ALI
Give it a rest lady. The show’s
exhausting and I’ve seen it too many
times to stick for the finale.

36.
BECKY
Sorry what. What did you say.
KEITH
She said--BECKY
Oh I heard her but I just wanna make
sure I heard it correct-lee. Ali
darling. Care to take it one more time
from the top with feeling see vous
play?
ALI
Look at yourself.
Easy now.

HOWARD

Becky does just that in the glass window reflection and it’s
obvious she loves what she sees. She blows herself a kiss.
ALI
Would Becky Something wither and die
if she interacted on an adult level?
HOWARD
Let’s not. Let’s be calm. Let’s
withdraw to somewhere neutral place
and talk compromises.
BECKY
BORING. Bore snore.
Ali grabs a coat, brushes past Becky with a final icy dagger
stare. Howard is chin-in-palm, in agony, losing everything
because he isn’t thinking fast enough.
BECKY (CONT’D)
WELL the least you could make some
sort of grand final statement right?
ALI
I took care of this band while you
took care of yourself. I never asked
to be thanked. I never wanted the
gloss. That was your thing. You
plucked me into it. So why should I
explain myself when you’re just going
to remember your version.
She kisses her fingers and makes a ‘peace’ sign.

37.
Ali gives the briefest pause on her exit, to Howard, then
Mari, not expecting her to follow, but to say with her eyes
‘that’s that.’ Mari half opens her mouth like she is going to
say something but doesn’t because Ali is already gone.
BECKY
It’s just as Ya-Ema prophesized!
Ha ha, what a fitting moment just when
I was seriously doubting your
commitment. I mean it’s been a rotten
year stuck carrying this mongoloid to
term but today was the final straw and
I knew it when I walked in the d-o-or. I felt the fetid stink in the
elevator. Biggggg whoop. Want to see
how quickly we bounce back? Watch me.
I’m Ali now.
14

RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

14

She storms back into the studio and bangs on the drums with
no rhythm. It’s a cacophonous mess and just dreadful noise
and Becky is screaming over the banging. It’s godawful and
she grabs her guitar, strums with one hand and smashes a
cymbal with the other and screeches into a mic.
BECKY
(voice of Old Prospector)
Keith hit record we’ve struck gold!
15

RECORDING STUDIO MIXING BOOTH

15

Howard is mortified about the collapse of a profitable act as
Mari chokes back lumps of emotion because she is tethered to
this sinking ship. Move in tight on her face as Becky’s noise
becomes even worse. It’s all happening for Mari now. Ali is
gone. This is rock bottom.
HOWARD (O.C.)
I’m so fucked. The next band’s going
to show up any minute. You shoulda
told me you were still here. I need
time to think.
Excuse me.

MARI

HOWARD
Hey don’t just leave me here--(his talking fades out)
Follow Mari out into the hallway and then the ladies room.

38.
16

RECORDING STUDIO, LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

16

It’s grim and dirty because only the band uses it. Mari takes
a small hit of her own drugs, a few pills, and pauses, not to
the mirror, just by the sink area. It’s all crashing down.
This is ending and she knows it more than she feared.
Time gets wobbly. Slow motion/hazy dissolves. Stay with Mari
and feel her studying the years of her life which have been
invested in this band. She is stoned and lapses into a memory
tunnel. Sounds that aren’t there can be heard, echoing from
the back of her memory. It’s woozy.
17

RECORDING STUDIO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

17

Mari comes out into the hallway. Something is off. The lights
are different than before and all seems quiet. Not a sound at
all. Mari seems confused. Then she hears girlish chatting
echoing down the hall, hollow and chipper.
She follows it and drifts back into the mixing room.
18

RECORDING STUDIO MIXING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

18

An unexplained element: a trio of younger, raw girls.
Uh---

MARI

This girls are all younger than 25. The next generation. They
are THE AKERGIRLS: DOTTIE O.Z., CRASSY CASSIE and ROXIE
ROTTEN. They are all cool as anything and stripped down
somehow stylish even beyond what Becky and co. could ever
imagine. Greasy hair, boys clothes, either no makeup at all
or a ton and it’s really styled. They run the gamut. Dottie
has pink hair. Roxie washes hers once a month. Cassie’s is
styled and really well cut, shaggy, simple.
DOTTIE
Marielle Hell. Fuckin’ fuck what an
honor.
The Akergirls bow, take hands like the witches they are and
surround Mari, who is slow and perplexed. After they break
off, Dottie and Roxie stay holding hands, embracing.
MARI
Mari’s fine.
DOTTIE
We’re booked. I mean, we were booked
here. Like, Howard said--

39.
MARI
I heard. It’s just a whole nightmare
right now.
She looks through the glass: in the studio Becky is banging
on silly instruments, plastic toys: lit up and glazed down.
CASSIE
Are you kidding, we only want this
place because you guys record here.
ROXIE
Shameful to say it’s an honor to be
bumped by Something She. Like, the
top. I’m rambling. Sorry, nerves!
MARI
It’s alright. But uh, this is a
terrible time. We’re down a woman and,
um, this is all going, like, the worst
it’s ever gone.
She looks around. Keith seems to be managing the schedule.
MARI (CONT’D)
Keith, where’s Howard?
KEITH
Back office. Might wanna check on
him. He doesn’t look good and I
think he’s dry heaving.
MARI
See, exactly. Not to get too deep but
shit’s like, falling apart big time
now so maybe actually we move out and
you girlies take over.
She’s losing them. The Akergirls are transfixed, watching
Becky, somehow having pulled it together and singing a song
with acoustic guitar.
All watch for a moment and just briefly, through the POV of
the Akergirls, you see the attraction to Becky: she is
brilliant and powerful. The song is ‘Because You’re Young’ by
Cock Sparrer.

40.
BECKY
Because you're young, you're torn between
A world of hate and a world of dreams
So much to lose, so much to gain
So much to fight for, so much to change
You don't look back, you don't look down
You gotta turn everything around
You live your life like a loaded gun
Because you're young
Stop talking back, get off the phone
You're late again,
you missed the last bus home
This ain't the way you want to live
I know something's got to give
(song continues over the next bit of dialogue)
ROXIE
Fuck man. She’s the queen.
MARI
I wouldn’t let her hear you say that.
Does she already know you’re here?
Unclear.

CASSIE

MARI
So I don’t know if she’s going to be
into that. The behavior around here is
shall we say erratic lately. Erratic
on a good day.
CASSIE
On a bad day?
MARI
They’re all bad days nowadays.
Howard enters, pale and chomping antacid tablets. He tries
not to let anybody see: he wants to make a solution happen.
HOWARD
Seems we’ve got a logjam!
MARI
I can see that.
HOWARD
We’re all family here, right? Business
family. One big happy business family.

41.
DOTTIE
If there’s some probl-HOWARD
Nonsense. No problem at all!
Everything’s fine. We record your
album. Release it. Everything will
work out. Easy as pie. Becky will
understand.
Roxie Rotten is still just watching Becky, who now looks up:
an animal at the zoo aware of being watched. Everybody
freezes because her playing stops. The lioness sees.
DOTTIE
I’d say she knows we’re here now.
Keith subtly turns off the recording. The room freezes as
people watch Becky slowly make the realization that she has
an audience. She stares them all down. One by one. Direct eye
contact. She speaks softly. Nobody can hear the words. Her
face is a mystery. No screaming, no smiling, just talking and
motioning to her instruments and pointing directly at Mari.
It’s almost dead silent.
MARI
Here she comes.
Becky stands up slowly in continued agonizing silence and
makes her way to the booth. She enters and faces this massive
crowd: Keith, Howard, Mari, Cassie, Dottie, Roxie. There’s an
unfamiliar look on her face, one Becky Something doesn’t
display very often. Absolute confusion and vulnerability. For
a rare moment, she is quiet. Nothing exits her mouth save for
tiny, nervous gasps of air.
Mari shakes her head slightly, making sure to convey that she
doesn’t know what’s going on and had nothing to do with it.
BECKY
Who the fuck are these bitches?
HOWARD
The Akergirls. Did I not send you
their seven inch? You’re gonna love
them. You’ll love them. I’ve, yeah,
I’ve signed them and now theyROXIE
We’re not interrupting. No disrespect
Miss, uh Something.
Huge fans.

DOTTIE

42.
They all do the circle thing around Becky who is still slow.
HOWARD
As thrilling as it is to see your
passionate commitment, I was counting
on the studio being free by now.
Perhaps that’s my mistake. I haven’t
exactly been around.
BECKY
You cut us off. They tried to evict
me. Why would you do that to us?
HOWARD
A misunderstanding! I was giving you
space and freedom without me breathing
down your neck. I did what I had to do
to tighten my belt. Can you blame me?
Everyone is calm, assuming Becky will explode.
BECKY
Okay.
(to Mari)
You know about this?
CASSIE
We just showed. She had no idea.
Becky still thinks. We don’t ever see her think. She usually
acts without it. She takes it all in. Studies the girls.
BECKY
Howard you fucking genius!
Becky lapses happily into the Akergirls witchy circle and
gently touches each of their faces.
BECKY (CONT’D)
What are the odds. What are the ODDS
that we’d find ourselves one apple
short of a bushel and today of all
days you unknowingly bring a solution
to all the world’s problems. Who plays
drums?
Cassie raises her hand. Becky high fives it.

43.
BECKY (CONT’D)
The rest of you ready to jam? If I had
to guess I’d say we’re fifteen maybe
twenty minutes away from pure magic
exploding into this room and silly old
me lost a drummer on the way to
grandmother’s house. Here I thought
we’d have to scrap paper and go home
but what should happen instead? Three
witches come to my rescue. I mean just
look at all of you. You’re all so
beautiful. Stunning.
The Akergirls blush at Becky’s kindness. Their idol! Becky
touches all their hair and generally paws at them in a weird,
grope-y way. Mari stands back, still and silent and loopy.
CASSIE
I’m Crassy Cassie. This is Dottie O.Z.
And Roxie Rotten. She’s the life of
the party and we’d be honored.
Becky looks at Roxie and Dottie, celebrating this minor
victory with a loving embrace. Becky studies it, dubious.
BECKY
Cut the shit you’re making me feel a
hundred years old but god damn I just
feel a connection to you babes. Mari,
you feel that?
Mari is dead silent. Becky gives her a look, like: ‘are you
in or out?’ And Mari knows it’s now or never.
MARI
Yeah Beck. I feel it. I’ve been out
here feeling it for what feels like
ever waiting for you to feel it.
BECKY
That’s what I’m talking about. Howard
my Goodman. I’m ready to party and
make a album and I have been sent
angels to help me work the angels if
you dig. What better way to introduce
new blood into this turgid process
than actual new blood.
Becky bites Dottie on the neck, then bites Cassie.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Let’s Bathory these bitches and learn
a thing or two about what kids are
feeling nowadays!

44.
Dottie and Cassie rub their necks. Becky actually bit them
pretty damn hard.
Inward ho!

BECKY (CONT’D)

Becky commands them into the studio area. Howard holds Mari
and Becky back.
HOWARD
Keith, could you give us a minute?
Keith exits.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
What the hell are you doing?
BECKY
It looks like I’m saving your asshole
and keeping this record right on
schedule. Don’t worry about
reimbursing me for the studio. It’s my
treat.
HOWARD
I can’t afford eight more months. I’ll
go bankrupt while you your “opus.” I’m
on my last credit line and you’re on
life number nine. These girls might be
our salvation so it’d be swell if you
didn’t torpedo them in the process of
drowning.
BECKY
What is this, the scared straight
express? Howard, you confuse
torpedoing that I don’t know about
with making an album which if you’ll
excise me I’m quite eager to resume
before my juices dry up again.
HOWARD
(to Mari)
Can you make her aware?
BECKY
What, do I need a translator? I got
it. Loud and clear and as ear on the
rear of a deer.
MARI
We don’t have to do this. I mean, we
just met them. We can take a day to
regroup and call Ali--

45.
BECKY
Who?I don’t know anybody by that name.
Kind of a funny name isn’t it? ‘cept
for a Muslim.
Mari slaps Becky hard across the face. It’s silent again and
through the glass, the Akergirls notice and look in. Becky
smiles like a psychotic. Howard continues to suffer silently.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Mari. My love. You have my attention.
Becky grabs Mari’s cheek and pinches it real hard and then
smacks her on the butt at the same time, holding her close.
BECKY (CONT’D)
And I yours. Now is there something
you wanted to say or was that merely a
challenge to a duel.
MARI
We don’t get another chance. If we
fuck this up...sorry...if you fuck
this up, it’s bye bye Something She.
You dig?
HOWARD
That’s the short of it.
This is the first moment Becky doesn’t act like the Tazmanian
Devil. Not Becky Something. Rebecca Adamczyk. Clear eyed.
BECKY
I’m going to finish this record. You
have my word cross my heart and hope
to die.
She transforms for six seconds. Just as quick her eyes switch
back: Becky Something returns and she skips into the studio
with the Akergirls. Mari and Howard eye one another.

BECKY
One two, skip to my lou. Three four,
skip to my door. Cows in the pasture,

The Akergirls joined in and they all spin in a circle and
Becky claps and leads a forced sing a long.

HOWARD
It’s over. That’s that. I trusted you
to be alone and you burned down the
house. I’m so sorry. I’ve tried
everything I can.
MARI
I’ll sort it. The lioness saw
threatening cubs and forced ‘em into
the pride rather than kill and eat
them.
HOWARD
Can you handle her?
MARI
It’s been almost seven years. What’s
another seven days.
HOWARD
You’re one on one without Ali. I can’t
help you. But I need you.
MARI
I’ve got this, man.
HOWARD
You need your rocket fuel?
Mari looks into the studio. The sing a long is over and the
Akergirls bring in gear and Becky is ducking into a tent in
the corner, head down, and Mari knows what that means. It’s a
small/big moment on Mari, quiet, lingering.
MARI
I’m need all the help I can get.
21

RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

21

Follow Mari in. She surveys the room. The Akergirls are
unloading their bags of gear and tuning up a little and Mari
sees the tapestry tent of Becky’s corner rustling.
Mari joins. From afar the Akergirls see their feet under the
cloth and know the deal.

47.
Show each of their faces, linger on the moment where they
should know better and split. They each give one another a
subtle look.
22

RECORDING STUDIO, BECKY’S LITTLE TENT

22

Mari and Becky share a rare, quiet, intimate moment. We jump
back in here just after they’ve each had a little something
and they’re both buzzing and ready to pop.
Becky is lighting a cigarette so the tent is lit via Zippo.
MARI
You okay to do this?
BECKY
Any second now. I’ll be fine.
Mari gives Becky a look of extreme compassion and empathy.
BECKY (CONT’D)
(half normal)
Give me a minute?
Mari exits. We stay with Becky. In silence, for a moment,
just a fleeting instant of adult awareness, that Becky
understands that this is it. There’s no chance after this.
Becky is still, starting to slip into a daze when her doubt
fades away and she lights up like a fire cracker, slams her
Zippo closed and storms out into the room.
23

RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

BECKY
Who’s ready to do this shit!
The Akergirls are stoked, in a tizzy that so quickly they
have been welcomed to the inner sanctum. They are comfy.
Shoes off (sneakers/no socks/very cool boots). Ready to work.
DOTTIE
Anything you say.
BECKY
Easy there. Easy easy. It’s not as
simple as that. I’m comfortable in a
leadership role but let’s slide into
this hot spring.

48.
ROXIE
You want us to look at any sheets or
just follow along.
BECKY
Whoa you chicks read music? Fuck what
a loser I am. There are some pieces
we’ve been playing with but wouldn’t
it make more sense for us to not rely
on table scraps and make a feast as a
new family instead?
MARI
The album is written if that’s what
you all mean.
CASSIE
Let’s hit it? We’re here for you.
Whatever you need. Say the word.
BECKY
Sure there is an album. There is some
music but maybe they’re the problem?
They’re cursed. Done to death. We need
the new sound. Show me what the kids
are doing.
Akergirls just look at one another.
DOTTIE
What, just play?
BECKY
Could I have made myself any clearer
YES play. If we’re gonna be working
together lets see what you’ve got.
There’s tension. The Akergirls are afraid of being cast out
and feel Becky’s judgement lurking. They strap on guitars (no
bass), Cassie gets to the drums and they launch into a super
sweet sounding melodic screechy early 90s Riot Grrrl inspired
song you could dance to, and indeed Becky does dance. Cassie
sings from behind the drums while Roxie and Dottie bring
harmonies and backing on the chorus. It’s a fully
collaborative song.
(the song is called ‘Can’t Wait’ and has been written by
Anika Pyle.)

49.
AKERGIRLS
Sweet tooth let it consume you
You know you want to, you know you want to
But baby I can’t wait around for you
Tell me what you think you’re gonna do
You know that I’m still in love with you
But baby I can’t wait around for you
I keep comin’ round but you’re not home
I keep callin’ you won’t pick up the phone
Am I such a fool to assume
You think about me the way I think about you?
You say it could change for just fade away
But I feel the same have you fallen from grace?
Yeah I’m here today but I can’t wait around
Won’t wait around, can’t wait around for you
So tell me what you think you’re gonna do
You know that my love will always be true
But baby I can’t wait around for you
I can’t wait around, can’t wait around,
I can’t wait around, I can’t wait for you
Can’t wait around, I can’t wait,
Baby I can’t wait for you
Can’t wait around for you
It’s great and runs like 90 seconds. Tight, fast and lovely.
Becky dances like a maniac, bobbing her head like a
bobblehead. Mari is feeling it, tapping her leg.
BECKY
SMOKIN’! I love it. Love love love.
Becky kisses Dottie, Roxie and Cassie in the weird way they
are now used to. She is super affectionate and keeps her
hands all over them while throwing her body on theirs.
(IN THE BOOTH YOU SEE KEITH AND HOWARD, WATCHING, DIGGING IT)
BECKY (CONT’D)
This is what its about my sisters. Who
wrote it?
DOTTIE
(pointing one by one)
Music, melody, lyrics.
BECKY
All of you? Brilliant. I’ve always
longed for that connection but for
some reason it never worked. I always
did it all. By. Myself.

50.
Akergirls look at Mari, who doesn’t disagree but it’s clear
this credit hogging is a long time scab being picked at.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Oh sure Mari, your contributions have
been helpful. But I’m talking about a
ground up collaboration. I wish I
could give it to you now but I know
myself too well. Highway or her way.
(thumbs at herself)
CASSIE
We’re here to jam. Back you up.
Anything.
BECKY
See, that’s what I need. Followers.
Silent peons to worship at my feet.
Mari is being beaten down silently. Becky is fully aware of
how much she is hurting her long time partner as she begins
to prowl about the recording studio, moving like a spider,
preparing to launch into a messy soliloquy.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Ladies ladies, what harmony you have
found within one another! What spirit,
shared, divided three ways. Alas. The
rarest of things and not to be taken
lightly. Capture it, my sisters, hold
on to it and n-n-never release from
the bond you share.
Dottie and Roxie share a loving look. This all pains Mari.
Becky is showboating for the Akergirls and making her last
ally feel terrible. During Becky’s speech, we are on Mari’s
face as realization sets in.
MARI
Wise advise from a true original. Are
you fucking kidding me? I hope you
girlies don’t buy this bullshit. You
seem smart. Smarter than me, dumb ol’
Mari. Grade A sucker, bought it hook
line and sinker, fool me once, shame
shame shame.
BECKY
Um sorry but what?
MARI
Who better than the great Becky
Something to dispel wisdom on the
value of others?
(MORE)

51.
MARI (CONT'D)
Who does more to express appreciation
and dedication to those who support?
BECKY
I support. It’s not a two-a-day two
way street darling.
MARI
A dead end, darling.
BECKY
Mari Mari Mari. Careful now. You’re
gonna offend our guests.
MARI
Sorry sorry sorry.
DOTTIE
We can leave? We don’t wanna be flies
on the wall. You sort this out alone.
BECKY
Now you’ve done it. Alienating the
acolytes. Vanquish the venerating.
Exile the exuberant. This is a blessed
thing! The next. Hold them close, we
should. Not expel them from our midst.
ROXIE
It’s not expulsion--BECKY
Quiet, all! This is important.
MARI
It always is. And then it’s not.
Mari is cool as ice, calm, chill, slick. Eyes half open, dead
tired of this. She keeps it together and begins to pace
about, gathering her things: packing a bass into a travel
bag. Ali leaving and Becky’s togetherness monologue reveal
what Mari repressed. She’s pushed over the edge, finally.
BECKY
Run away! Flee flee. Big bad bossy
Becky makes maudlin Mari mope. Get the
bullshit outta here. It belongs, it
belongs on fuckin’ Mars!
(in the style of Heavy
Metal Parking Lot)
Mark pauses her exit. Turns to Dottie, Cassie and Roxie.

52.
MARI
Enjoy it. It could be fun.
BECKY
Now that’s the first logical thing
I’ve heard all day!
Mari exits with a final look back at Becky, who returns it
not as Becky Something but as Rebecca Adamczyk.
BECKY (CONT’D)
(to Akergirls)
All I’ve ever asked is respect and if
you can’t get that in the work place
then where can ya get it? You dig,
right?
Becky jumps on Cassie’s back, piggy back style and starts
whacking her with a drumstick like a pony.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Mush mush! Onward! Into the future.
The Akergirls, Dottie Cassie and
Roxie. The latest greatest girl
rockers found right here under a wing
of the eternal Becky Something. The
backing on the final Something She
record and a smash debut album
produced by none other than talent
finder and nurturer Becky herself. Ah
ha! On the wings of angels, a goddess
and three witches. Something Rotten
Crassie and O.Z.!
Becky jumps down, knocking herself and Cassie and some gear
to the floor. Dottie and Roxie help Cassie. You can tell for
them that in the past fifteen minutes, the luster has faded.
Becky has alienated those who the Akergirls believed to be
true partners. The attitude on display fills them with dread.
ROXIE
Maybe we should come back. This
doesn’t seem like the right time.
BECKY
Night time is the right time. Bed ways
is right ways. Tally ho!
DOTTIE
Not that we aren’t knocked on our ass
flattered. We are.

53.
BECKY
Then let the wild rumpus begin!
Becky grabs an electric guitar and poorly shreds: “Garbage
Dump” by Charles Manson.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Oh Garbage dump, oh garbage dump
Why are you called a garbage dump?
You could feed the world with my garbage dump
You could feed the world with my garbage dump
CASSIE
Mari just left. We don’t need to be
here right now. We can give ya your
space. Like, this must not be super
easy? Us showing up when shits all
going down.
BECKY
ERRRRR. Wrong. I am the heart and soul
of the band. I mean hello I named it
after myself. I found those girlies
and they were not the first and they
will not be the last. I put Something
She together from the ashes of failed
junk bands, wanting to put one out
there in my own name like god spewing
mankind. That’s ancient history and so
are those ungrateful wenches who
suckled at the teet of success that I
placed upon their mouths. All I ask,
before the four of us embark on this
journey, is that you show me honesty
and I’ll do the same. That is the
pillar of my music so enough with this
jibber jabber and let’s rock.
(back to the Manson song)
That sums it up one big lump.
Becky is mile a minute, machine gun rat a tat fast. It’s like
reading billboards from a roller coaster. She keeps strumming
her guitar, not well but not terribly either. The Akergirls
look on, dazed.
DOTTIE
What should we do?

54.
BECKY
Well for starters go into that booth
and wake those turds up and tell them
that its blast off to the stars we go
hit the fucking switch because the
circus is leaving town and it ain’t
comin’ back.
There’s a silent pause where you can feel the Akergirls
deciding if they should do this or turn tail and go home.
Becky looks at them, aware of this indecision. She is static:
sweaty, messed up, total maniac. Trying to catch her breath,
nearly ten years of her life torpedoed in the last half hour.
It’s in her eyes: she looks beyond vulnerable and scared.
DOTTIE
(half afraid)
We’ll go get the rest of our gear.
BECKY
(like the Kool Aid Man)
OH YEAH!
We follow the Akergirls from behind as they walk into the
booth. Slow. Sheepish.
24

RECORDING STUDIO MIXING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

24

Only Keith is in here and there is a quiet moment where
Dottie, Roxie and Cassie are alone. It’s the first honest to
god silence we’ve had in ten minutes. Dottie and Roxie
embrace in the exact spot where Mari and Ali embraced at the
beginning of this act. They look through the glass at Becky.
She is actually focused, in real musician mode, tuning up and
getting ready.
The Akergirls are connected and know what one another are
thinking without saying it. They look like they sold their
souls to Satan. Keith points to the door; Cassie knocks it.
She opens it. Slowly.
25

RECORDING STUDIO HALLWAY

25

Cassie sticks her head into the hallway. She/we see Howard
talking to Mari. Face puffy and wet with tears. She wipes
them off both cheeks, looking cool.
Zero in on this tough, hard woman undone by her friend. She
left the studio a confident warrior, but it’s all surface.

55.
Dottie and Roxie look at her too and this tells them more
about what they are dealing with than anything they’ve
witnessed. It’s silent. Howard pushes past the girls, leaving
Mari to give one final look of warning.
MARI
You can’t be fully acquainted with
Becky Something until you want her to
fuck off. Remember that.
She turns and walks away and we linger on the Akergirls,
taking this omen to heart. One by one they file back in.
26

RECORDING STUDIO MIXING BOOTH

26

A moment of continued silence. Howard is, finally,
uncharacteristically nervous. Focus on each Akergirl. Each
has a silent beat to convey how excitement turned to shock to
nervousness to unease to fear. It’s hard for them.
All look through the glass at Becky. We zero in on her,
closer, slowly creeping as she finds her fingers lapsing away
from the guitar and snarls into the microphone, voice only.
27

RECORDING STUDIO

27

Half melodic. Half guttural. The messy but salvageable stuff
you hear as the secret track at the end of a CD.
Eyes closed, into the mic, she’s giving it her all and it’s
passionate and if this was her first record instead of
possibly her last, maybe it would be raw enough to impress
but as it is, it’s just kind of sad. It’s the end of the song
she was playing at the beginning.
BECKY
You look like you die, then apologize
But fuck it
I didn’t mean to see this through.
And I’m back to the same shit I was
Drowning in mud
If I’m gonna be pulled down
Then I’m taking you with
And I’m back to the same shit.
I was drowning in mud
If I’m gonna be pulled down
Then I’m taking you with.
Back on the Akergirls as this plays out. We zero in on them,
letting the worried looks on their faces do all the talking.
END OF ACT TWO.

56.
INTERLUDE #3 (3 YEARS BEFORE ACT 1)
GRAINY VHS HOME MOVIE FOOTAGE: Backstage at a club before a
show. Becky seems nervous, aloof and distant. She is quietly
standing away from Mari, Ali and her mother: ANIA. She has
the faintest trace of an accent.
Ania is being friendly and hugging Mari and Ali.
ANIA
Girls girls! I’m so proud of you.
ALI
My mom would never ever ever come to a
show.
ANIA
I never missed a show, a concert, a
school play. Tell them Becky.
MARI
Basically you’re our mom, too.
Okay mom.

BECKY

Ania goes to Becky and squeezes her face with love and joy.
ANIA
Oooh my baby’s nervous! So nervous!
BECKY
Stop it mom!
She pushes Ania a little.
ANIA
You’re so amazing. I’m so proud.
She laughs with Mari and Ali. But Becky’s not laughing.
ACT THREE: RED/SHAKY HANDHELD
28

INT. ROCK CLUB

28

A modest club really full with the eager and anxious. A
bird’s eye, overhead shot shows how packed it is. Moving
through the crowd, we zero in from above, on Danny pushing
through the crowd to the backstage door. He is waved through
by a bouncer.
The place glows red like Hell, which is what it feels like.

DANNY
Have you seen Becky? Has she checked
in?
To everyone and no one, busy bodies in the corridor. People
shake heads. He is agitated. This has gone on for a while,
playing the waiting game and when you play the waiting game
with Becky, you lose.

ROCK CLUB, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Danny’s feeling of relief is denied when he finds only Ania.
ANIA
How’s my grandbaby?
DANNY
She’s home with Tiffany.
ANIA
You are great to that child.
DANNY
I couldn’t do it alone.
ANIA
You did, when Rebecca left. Poor
Daniel. Drawn into the family saga.
DANNY
Time for a new family. Life goes on.
ANIA
Hopefully, it does.
A pregnant pause. Contemplating: what if it doesn’t.
DANNY
She’s not here. Everybody’s looking.
ANIA
What happened to my baby Rebecca. Did
I do something that wrong? Oh Daniel.
All we’ve put up with. For what?
For love.

DANNY

ANIA
Ah. Yes. For love.

58.
A quiet beat and then a knock on the door. This sequence has
a really rotten energy building, noise and motion growing
more extreme. Things in the background, distance, hallway
bump, fall and clatter. We’re heading toward motion sick
territory. The crowd sounds and venue noise and neon lights
make this all feel pretty agitating.
It’s just some RANDOM ROADIE who knocks.
RANDOM ROADIE
She in here?
Daniel and Ania shake heads. Roadie checks watch. Exhibits
stress.
RANDOM ROADIE (CONT’D)
We’re forty minutes behind. Venue’s
lights out at midnight.
DANNY
Don’t set your watch to Becky time.
Roadie exits. Another moment of silence.
ANIA
What are we doing here? She won’t
perform.
DANNY
She has to.
ANIA
Has to? Why?
DANNY
Because I have a bad feeling that this
is it for Becky.
ANIA
Opening a small venue with proteges?
She’s sold out arenas. Why do you fall
for it.
DANNY
She cut the head off our life
together. Swiftly and with no mercy.
Apparently I’ll never come to terms
with that.
He picks up some forms.
DANNY (CONT’D)
She’s way beyond what we agreed on for
Tama.
(MORE)

59.
DANNY (CONT’D)
We’ve been trying to get her and these
in the same room for three months.
ANIA
Her lawyer quit. He called me.
DANNY
Her plan is to ignore all the people
suing her and hope they give up. Or
die.
Another knock on the now ajar door. It’s Ali. She’s had a
pretty slick makeover since Act 2 and looks calm, measured
and reasonable. She scans the room. No Becky.
ALI
Shoulda known.
She cheek kisses Danny and then goes to Ania for a hug.
ANIA
Alexandra, dear.
ALI
We fell for it didn’t we.
DANNY
She’ll be here.
ALI
Where do you find the faith?
DANNY
It’s a curse. I’d kill to have none
and never be waiting.
ALI
Can’t believe I got talked into this.
DANNY
She needs you.
ALI
Every bully needs a weak punching bag
to swing back for one more smack.
Ali goes to the mirror. Applies more lip gloss to her already
extreme and ready-to-go show look. She looks awesome with
pink eye shadow and glitter and feathery hair.
ALI (CONT’D)
Who gives a shit about the players,
right? They’re just here for Becky.
What do I do? Quit and be nobody?
(MORE)

60.
ALI (CONT’D)
I don’t belong in this world. I used
to play church basements. I was happy
there. I never wanted shows as big as
this. Poor Ali van der Wolff. Plucked
from the underground. A footnote in
the defining oral history of the era.
Silence falls after Ali’s speech, delivered to the mirror.
DANNY
We all rely on her for something.
ALI
We rely on Miss Something for
something. Fame, work, money, love
support. Opportunity. The golden goose
sprays golden piss in our faces.
ANIA
She’s supported me for many years.
ALI
Me too. What a wretched feeling. As
you know.
DANNY
She’ll be here.
ALI
I envy envy envy that optimism. What’s
she ever done for you?
DANNY
She gave me our daughter.
ALI
She drop kicked Tama to your doorstep
from a speeding tour bus. Don’t
confuse that with sainthood.
DANNY
It’s not that simple. She wasn’t
ready.
ALI
Oh Danny boy. I wanna believe you. You
see our list? Nobody. Not a soul could
be bothered. Such is the end of the
saga of Something She. Ignominious.
Fitting. So let’s go.
ANIA
I’m going to go talk to security.

61.
Burst through the door: The Akergirls. You can tell in two
seconds that tonight is their night because they are
perfectly styled in the coolest, most influential way a rock
band of girls in their early 20s.
You see on their faces, though: the Becky panic. Because this
is a big show for them and the favor of letting Becky open
has already blown up in their young faces.
ALI
She ain’t here.
DOTTIE
Fuck fuck I fucking knew it.
ROXIE
She’ll show.
DOTTIE
Just don’t fucking talk to me okay?
DANNY
That’s the spirit.
CASSIE
Hey, Dirtbag Danny! It’s really you.
DANNY
Just Danny.
CASSIE
I taped your show religiously every
night.
DANNY
No shit? I don’t even have copies of
the early years. You got some special
stuff there.
ROXIE
(interjecting)
Anyway its just, this is like a big
fuckin’ deal for us and all.
Always is.

ALI

Nasty looks. Dottie won’t look at Roxie. They’ve split, and
it’s created awkwardness between the whole band. They never
speak, make eye contact, or get close. It’s tense.
ALI (CONT’D)
Don’t mind my trivializing your
professional dilemma.
(MORE)

62.
ALI (CONT’D)
I’ve been in your shoes more times
than I can count.
DOTTIE
Give us a success ratio. Anything. I’m
dying here. This is not okay. It’s not
okay! Like, there are rules, right?
Like we’ve gotta stick to the plan and
the plan is written in ink, right?
ALI
She’ll be here. Might be any second...
Pause. All look at door. Nothing.
ALI (CONT’D)
Might be in two hours. Its real cool
and all what you’re doing for Becky.
And me, I guess. Beck’s not used to
not headlining. She forgets that
nobody waits for the opener.
CASSIE
We figured with all the people here
for us-ALI
Because there’s industry in the room
Becky would take this ten percent more
seriously? Tried that one. If she
didn’t know about all that, maybe
she’d be here.
ROXIE
What do we do.
ALI
Vocal warm up? I dunno what your pre
show is. You wanna jam?
DOTTIE
This is beyond me. Find me when the
nightmare’s over.
Dottie storms out, shooting daggers at mostly Roxie.
CASSIE
She’s under a lotta pressure. We all
are.
ROXIE
And shit’s wobbly with us right now.
There’s heartbreak afoot.

63.
ALI
Wiser folks tried and failed. But hey
I signed the contracts for today so if
she don’t show you can sue her too. I
think that’ll be a baker’s dozen.
ROXIE
(to Danny and Ania)
Sorry. I’m Roxie. That was Dottie and
this is Cassie.
ANIA
Thank you for giving her this chance.
She doesn’t make it easy.
CASSIE
She’d do it for us. Already did,
actually.
DANNY
How’d you repay her? By fucking it all
up?
Silence. Knowing.
DANNY (CONT’D)
She’ll be here. The pattern is:
disappear, leave you hanging, make you
miserable and come back when she’s out
of options.
Ania takes Danny’s response in. She chuckles.
CASSIE
My mom wouldn’t step foot in a place
like this.
ANIA
I’m not here to watch Becky inflict
pain on others. There’s been enough of
that to last lifetimes. I’m here
because she needs me.
Another silence. The energy in this room is tense and there
keep being sounds in the hallway that make people jump,
thinking it’s Becky. Howard enters.
Nothing?
Nada.

HOWARD
ALI

64.
HOWARD
Well this is great. That’s it. I’m
done. It’s over. She’s cost me a
house. Half my company. Can you accuse
me of not trying hard enough? Did I
not present opportunity after
opportunity? And this is how it ends.
(sees Ania)
Forgive me, Ania. Lovely to see you.
ANIA
I know it, you know it.
Howard checks his watch. Looks at Cassie and Roxie.
HOWARD
Does it even matter how much longer we
wait?
CASSIE
We were supposed to start five minutes
ago so as of now, we’re going on hour
two of a sold out crowd waiting for
something to happen.
HOWARD
I’m deeply sorry. If I’d known--Cassie and Roxie shake their heads.
You can hear it. Building outside this room. The tremble of
noise, anticipation growing louder.
(BACK TO THE OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE CROWD. IT’S READY TO POP.)
Howard and co. listen like it’s a Godzilla attack. Eyes wide,
open, alarmed for how much longer they can survive in here.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
Give her ten more minutes. No. Five.
Then it’s over.
(to Ali)
I’m sorry. You know nobody wants this
night to go off more than me.
ALI
Wanna flip for it? I don’t suppose
there’s any benefit in an Ali van der
Wolff acoustic solo set.
HOWARD
At this point any one on stage but
Becky will make matters worse.

65.
ALI
Figured as much.
ROXIE
So wise, are you.
Ali puts her hands together and bows to them.
ROXIE (CONT’D)
So what now?
Just then, they hear it. The crowd is going wild over
something. Something is happening. (pun intended).
(OVERHEAD SHOT OF VENUE: EVERYBODY IS ERUPTING. IT’S
HAPPENING.)
The following utterance is of both relief and inevitability:
ALI
She’s here.
31

ROCK CLUB CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

31

Roxie, Cassie, Danny, Howard, Ania and Ali exit the dressing
room.
Procession down the hall, one after the other, closer to the
stage. The further they walk, the more things change.
The energy is stepping up a notch. There’s cheering, yelling,
chanting coming through the walls and the looks on our
character’s faces are equal parts fear and curiosity.
The ph balance of the building shifts, the temperature drops.
Our group gathers for the oncoming storm and focus shifts to
Ania, speaking to nobody, sadness and worry in her voice.
ANIA
I wanted the best for my baby girl.
Music lessons. Rides to concerts. She
played guitar in our church.
In like a tornado comes Becky and if she knows she’s two
hours late, she shows no sign. Her appearance backstage fades
out the cheers and applause as the exits the venue.
A corridor where each open door offers a different sliver of
high contrast, neon light. Becky is riding high as she walks
towards her throng of dependents chanting and clapping.

66.
BECKY
Dem bones dem bones dem dry bones
Dem bones dem bones dem dry bones
Dem bones dem bones gonna walk around
Dem bones dem bones gonna walk around
Now hear the word of the lord
Disconnecting dem bones, dem dry
bones...
She has an entourage in tow: Ya-Ema, looking dark and
controlling and a documentary camera/boom mic crew of two.
Sad looking, down and out but they create some sense of
heightened attention to what is otherwise not important.
Becky wears an open leather jacket with just a pink bra
underneath and the words ‘OLD SCRATCH’ scrawled on her torso.
Her hair is huge, very 80s metal. Her makeup is theatrical.
Because of the video camera, Becky plays everything up to the
Nth degree in an effort to put on a good performance. It’s
insufferable. She talks to the video camera, via to other
people who are not listening. Rather than saying hello to her
mother, she is on lap three already.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Ding dong the bitch is back. Who
missed me show of hands?
Howard pounces.
HOWARD
Two. Hours!
BECKY
Two. Minutes. To midniiiight!
(Iron Maiden song)
You’re actually suing me, right? Or
was that somebody else. I’ll see you
in court. Your honor. Is it a crime in
this country to prefer the witching
hour? I was born with an internal
clock. The doctor left it inside me ha
haaaa!! I call to the stand my mother,
Mrs. Ania Adamczyk nee Smolinska. Mrs.
Adamczyk, do you swear solemnly that
your daughter was born with a rare
neurological condition which renders
the passage of time an enforced
illusion of the external world?
(as herself)
Judge, please. I just can’t seem to
get goin’ until later at night. You
think I want to be late?
(MORE)

67.
BECKY (CONT'D)
There’s people deserve a show and you
have no idea the hell I’ve been
through because I’m wishing there is
any way on earth I could get going but
just knowing I’m not going to make it.
Promise me momma. When I die, have the
coffin arrive half an hour late and
written on the side in gold letters
are the words ‘sorry for the delay.’
Ha HA!
Oof. A terrible silence because, due to everything about
Becky, the idea of her dying before her mother feels so real
and perhaps inevitable. Everyone has been swept back away
from the stage into the dressing room again.
32

ROCK CLUB, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

32

It’s jam packed. Insanity, people moving everywhere to avoid
bumping into others. Ya-Ema has dropped to his knees and
wraps Becky’s ankles and places crystals from a bag on each
of her legs and feet and is lighting little sticks by her
feet in some odd purification ritual.
It’s pretty nutso looking and Becky’s camera gets it all,
including an increasingly despondent Danny and Ania.
ANIA
(tears in her eyes)
Rebecca. My sweet Rebecca.
BECKY
Mommmmmm, you’re embarrassing me in
front of my friends. I told you to
wait in the car. They’re making a
movie and I want them to see the real
me so ix-nay on the ebecca-Ray.
ANIA
How can you inflict such pain?
Becky looks at Ania and for a moment, the clouds of her mind
clear and her eyes change and if it’s remotely clear to
anybody what she is thinking, they don’t let on.
BECKY
Fuckin’ stop it with the dramatics,
mom! I haven’t seen you in months and
you lay this down?
Danny and Becky study one another, a major look passing.
Becky looks at Ania, whose hands now reveal an envelope from
her pocket.

68.
ANIA
Don’t be ungrateful. Tell me you know
I was always there.
BECKY
You get a pass. You did your time in
the trenches but you were alone. Don’t
you remember how alone you always
were? You remember how you were always
always alone.
ANIA
Your father wanted me to give you this
letter.
BECKY
Great throw it in the trash! Where was
he fifteen years ago when I was nobody
but his daughter?
Becky grabs the envelope and tosses it.
ROXIE
We should go.
BECKY
How’s married life, Dirtbag? Give my
best to Tiffany.
CASSIE
This is none of our business.
BECKY
Stay babes. Your loyalty will be
rewarded. That’s how it works. Isn’t
that right, Ali?
She pronounces it like Muhammad “Ali.” Ah-lee.
ALI
Funny, I didn’t know you saw me here.
BECKY
Kid, your energy is so foul I could
see you in the dark.
Ania losing her composure. She came in here, brave and
confident, but as usual, Becky is breaking her. She stands by
Danny silently asking for and receiving support from him.
ANIA
(quietly, to Danny)
Oh Daniel. Why?

69.
Ya-Ema, clearing Becky’s aura, gives Ali a mean glance. She
ignores it, and Becky’s rude remark. Taking the high road.
ALI
You ready to rock?
BECKY
I was born ready. Doesn’t everybody
know that by now? You think I need to
warm up like some mere mortal? I don’t
think so, Tim. Would I have stepped
foot in this joint if I wasn’t ready
for a double-V victory and if that
means a great show two hours later
than a crummy one people can thank me
later alligator.
(to Roxie/Cassie)
Children, join me in the sacred circle
of spiritual cleanse. Where’s the
third member of your coven?
(screaming)
DOTTIE O.Z. you your butt in here this
instant you are guh-rounded!
(to Ania/Danny)
How’m I doing mom? Mother of the year
over here, ya dig!
Ania steps away from Becky, unwilling to play this game.
Dottie runs in, frantic. Surveys Becky, seated with wraps and
crystals, smoke around her, everybody else buzzing nervously
around, Danny and Ania moving away, Cassie and Roxie in
shock. The video camera whips to get her entrance.
Finally.

DOTTIE

BECKY
Girls, gather round. Join the circle
of energy. Anybody who does not to be
here you can leave or avert your gaze.
(to video camera)
Not you.
Becky closes her eyes. Ali and the Akergirls do the same.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Dear goddess of creativity and
positivity, Becky here. How’s it
going? I’m speaking to you tonight not
only on behalf of myself but also my
little sisters Dottie O.Z., Cassie
Crassy and Roxie Rotten.
(MORE)

70.
BECKY (CONT’D)
This is a big night for them so let’s
take care of Akergirls. They’re swell
kids and deserve the best.
She pauses. The energy shifts and people sense something. Ali
leans in, alarmed, like Becky is about to drift away. Becky’s
breathing changes and it’s really weird.
BECKY (CONT’D)
As for me. Lady, if you’re listening
still, I need this. I need this bad.
This is it for ol’ Beckster. I’m gonna
need your help here because the last
train is leaving the station and if
I’m not on it when the whistle blows,
that’s it for me. Lights out. Last
call. Soup’s cold. Ice cream’s
melting. Beer’s warm. Yuck. Let’s
rally, one more time, then you can
take that soul I promised you.
Danny shuffles, alarmed, when she says this. Becky stops the
prayer. Everybody is silent. The doubt of Howard and Ali
about her not grasping the importance of tonight is gone.
Maybe Becky was late because she actually wants to make this
perfect. Maybe she is all clear headed and aware of herself,
finally. Becky looks right at the video camera.
BECKY (CONT’D)
You get it? Perfect. Start with that
it’ll be fucking phenomenal now let’s
burn this fucker down for the big
finish.
She jumps and crystals fall and she lands with jazz hands
when saying ‘big finish.’ The room is in shock.
HOWARD
Let me...let me go tell them you’re
ready.
He exits and Becky is gone. You see her ducking into the
bathroom and slamming the door. Danny looks at Ali, sad.
Junkie ducking into the bathroom...bad news.
DANNY
Another poor decision. I’m leaving.
Make sure she takes these.
He throws down legal forms.
ANIA
I’ll join you, in a moment.

71.
ALI
You’re not gonna watch the show?
ANIA
I don’t want to see what happens next.
But I have one thing to say to my
daughter.
Danny kisses Ali on the cheek.
DANNY
I’m sorry things turned out this way.
ALI
You and me both, Danny boy. You know
I’m always rootin’ for ya.
DANNY
The legal stuff was meant to light a
fire under her ass.
ALI
Joan of Arc she ain’t. Flames or not.
Go home. We’ll talk tomorrow.
Both look at the bathroom door. There’s an unspoken thing
here but Ali’s going to speak it. She holds back tears.
ALI (CONT’D)
Hopefully not sooner.
(pause)
Love you, Dan-O.
She blows him a kiss. Danny exits. It’s Ali, Ania, Ya-Ema and
the Akergirls now. Ania picks up the letter she brought and
holds it in her hands.
CASSIE
She gonna be okay?
ANIA
(utmost certainty)
No she’s not..
Ya-Ema prepares a spiritual area for Becky to be in when she
gets out, placing mystical objects carefully. The video
camera is getting close on all of it.
ALI
I know that you need to listen to an
old has been like me but you’re gonna
kill it tonight. And after tonight.
Please love one another.

72.
Zero in on the Akergirls. This is all about the people around
Becky and how she affects them. We stay on the Akergirls and
it’s clear, following Act 2, that they are through the
looking glass with Becky. Now they want to tell her to fuck
off.
There’s silent sadness among the Akergirls. They watch Ali
and Ania walk to Becky’s bathroom and they exit, giving them
privacy. A quiet moment in a story light on them.
33

ROCK CLUB CORRIDOR/AKERGIRLS DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

33

Follow the Akergirls to their dressing room. More orderly and
less intense than the one we just left. Silent. They look in
their mirrors, grab a water, a cigarette. They start lighting
candles around a small table on the floor. Finally:
DOTTIE
Is there something we should do?
CASSIE
(real shook up, still)
What else can we do.
ROXIE
We shouldn’t have asked her to play.
She’s not straight.
DOTTIE
We gave her a chance. That’s only
right.
ROXIE
Kill your idols.
CASSIE
Give em enough rope and they’ll do it
themselves.
The girls take hands and close their eyes, ready to lapse
into a mystical seance which is their tradition before shows.
34

ROCK CLUB, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - THAT SAME MOMENT

34

Ali and Ania lean on the door. We are close to Ali, close
enough to see the tears and anxiety on her face. Talking to a
wall. No better metaphor for dealing with Becky.
ALI
I didn’t want it to be like this. Why
did you make it have to be like this?
I blame you, Beck. You found me.
(MORE)

73.
ALI (CONT'D)
You invited me. I never wanted any of
it. I only wanted to rock with you and
Mari. Not all this.
The door opens. Becky is glassy eyed, doped up. She looks
like a tranquilized animal. In a way, she is. She looks at
Ania, holding the letter she brought.
BECKY
What the fuck is that still doing
here?
ANIA
He has things he wants to say to you.
I see no harm in that. Do you
understand forgiveness? Can you
understand regret?
BECKY
You weak stupid wimp. After everything
he has put us through. I uses to look
up to you.
Ania is gutted. She is in agony, as usual, because of Becky.
ANIA
I always hoped you were better than
this. Deep down I knew you weren’t.
You’re more like your father than
you’ll ever know.
Ania takes the letter and grabs Becky’s hand, shoving it in.
The forcefulness of Ania’s negativity momentarily stuns Becky
silent, static, stunned. (So this is where she gets it...)
Ania exits quickly as the letter falls to the floor. Ali
picks the letter up but Becky grabs at it and they become
attached. Becky has slipped into a trance.
BECKY
Destroy it!!
They struggle for control of the paper as it tears in their
hands.
ALI
Stop...Beck...stop...
She takes Ali by the face and squeezes her head hard, the
pain is real and they fall to the floor and Becky begins
chanting/yelling.

74.
BECKY
Negative forces! I cast you out! Be
gone from here and wipe this room of
evil. Let in the light and forsake the
darkness.
They are rolling on the ground and Becky doesn’t let go. Ali
grabs for stuff, lamps and tapestries and furniture and
around them the entire room crumbles and collapses inward. YaEma watches silently and the video camera gets it all.
ALI
You’re hurting me-Becky has a hand on Ali’s throat as well as her forehead. She
is out of her mind hallucinating.
BECKY
Demon, speak not to me. To hear your
words is to open myself to your
trickery.
She puts her hand over Ali’s mouth and Ali continues to
struggle to protect herself.
ALI
Beckpthhhh sttttppp
Becky takes a glass bottle, breaks it and brandishes with her
free hand. We go close to see the abject terror and
uncertainty in Ali’s eyes.
BECKY
I’ve fought you in eleven other lives
and in eleven other lives you’ve
destroyed me. I’ve seen the faces
you’ve used and my demise at your
hands across the centuries. Now at
last I’ve looked across time and I see
how to defeat those who will see me
destroyed!
Becky is scratching herself and Ali with the glass. Red marks
and pricks of blood are forming. Ali tries to yell for help
but she is out of breath. It’s not loud enough and she makes
direct eye contact with Ya-Ema who stands with folded hands
and will not move a finger to help and the camera crew,
filming and not helping.
BECKY (CONT’D)
For the first time I have the power to
do what must be done and for the last
time we struggle.
(MORE)

75.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Alight in me, eternal powerful
goddesses and give me the strength to
vanquish my enemies once and for all.
On battlefields and at the stake.
Ali somehow gets free, knocks Becky in the face. Bloody nose.
Her weapon falls and the blood runs down her exposed chest
under the jacket.
Ali stumbles to the door, heaves at it, tears it open and
screams as loud as she can.
ALI
HELP HELP SOMEBODY HELP.
She turns around. Becky is standing in front of Ya-Ema,
laughing. A crazed look on her face like ‘can’t you take a
joke’ but because her nose is bloody and she has OLD SCRATCH
written on her sweaty, bloody torso and all the rest, she
looks truly dangerous.
The two old friends stare at one another across the trashed
room, bloody, out of breath, frenzied. Becky’s stupid insane
smile is infuriating.
BECKY
THE ARISTOCRATS!
And she laughs for a few seconds before losing her balance
and steading herself on a chair just as Howard rushes in with
a big security guard. They are prepared for an OD so when
they rush in are surprised to see Becky has the upper hand,
survey the mess and injuries and Ali looks the most afraid.
Security goes to Becky to restrain her and even though he is
6’4” and 300 pounds she puts up a hell of a fight. She claws
and kicks and is lifted off the ground but lands a few blows.
BECKY (CONT’D)
(faux 1930s moll voice)
I don’t give a rat’s! Put me in the
slammer. I’ll be back on the streets
by noon. There’s no clink in the world
that can hold the likesa me.
SECURITY GUARD
Miss, shut your mouth and stop
attacking me please.
BECKY
Who’safraid of the big bad wolf! I’m
afraid of the van der Wolff! Ali! Back
me up here. Ah I don’t get no respect
at all.

76.
Becky bites the security guard and is able to get free. She
grabs the glass bottle again and points it at him. The guard
lunges forward and she slices his arm. It’s bleeding and he
kicks her, pretty hard, to get her to drop the weapon and
finally pins her against a wall and puts handcuffs on her.
Like a rabid dog, Becky barks and tries to bite people but
never stops looking happy, grinning, smiling because somehow
it hasn’t sunk in yet that this isn’t a game. She barks and
snarls right at the video camera lens.
Off to the side, Ali is regaining herself and cleaning wounds
and standing in the doorway, which we haven’t seen until now,
are the Akergirls, watching Becky bite and snarl.
The documentary crew is getting it all. Becky, fallen to
floor, handcuffed, bleeding, looks up at her audience with
delight and joy. There’s a physical fight in her body because
the adrenaline is wearing off and it’s fighting the drugs and
she is starting to get wobbly.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I confess. It was me! I robbed the
savings and loan and I shot the
sheriff and I fought the law and the
law won. Now when do I get my lousy
phone call?
Speechless. Turn to Howard and Ali, still composing herself.
The Akergirls are truly shocked.
HOWARD
(to Ali)
Can you...anything?
ALI
No. It’s over.
Ali wipes the blood off her neck and lip and throws the cloth
in Becky’s face. Pauses. She’s thinking about hitting or
spitting on Becky. Instead she turns to leave. Silent.
Humiliated. Battered. It somehow hits Becky.
BECKY
Hey. Hey! Sorry I messed up your
pretty face.
Nobody is listening. Becky stands to run, chase after Ali.
35

ROCK CLUB CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

35

Ali is already gone, somehow. Becky turns side to side but is
being pursued by the video camera, Howard and security.

77.
She runs to a door and throws her body at it. It opens. It’s
the wrong door. The door Danny entered backstage from at the
start of this act. She is somehow in the middle of the venue.
36

ROCK CLUB, FLOOR AREA - CONTINUOUS

36

Bloody, shackled, people turn to look because the light on
top of the video camera draws attention. Cheering and
applause start, as though it is all part of the act.
The crowd throbs as Becky pushes through it, parting for her
like the Ten Commandments Red Sea. She is given a clear path
to the stage as people chant her name.
CROWD
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!
The crowd closes, swallowing up Howard. The Akergirls stay in
the door, not entering the floor space. This is crazy, shaky,
hazardous looking stuff. Flashing red lights and yelling and
screaming abound. The Akergirls know to fall back.
37

ROCK CLUB, THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

37

Becky feebly climbs up which is hard without hands. The sweat
is mixing with blood and the OLD SCRATCH marker writing so
she’s pretty colorful. Her white pants are tie dyed looking.
CROWD
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!
She leans to the mic.
BECKY
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!
This goes on for several seconds as the crowd slowly stops,
sensing that this isn’t an act and they are actually
witnessing the actions of a damaged and troubled woman.
The camera crew is at the foot of the stage, getting it all.
Security climbs to the stage. Becky slips away from him and
grabs the mic.
BECKY (CONT’D)
D’ya ever get the feeling you’re being
followed?
Muted but loud cheers. Becky, clutching the mic and being
grabbed at by security, launches into an epic rant that, no
matter how hard she is being chased, doesn’t stop.

78.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I’ve been back through the ages of
earth and I’ve witnessed centuries of
conflict. I regressed to the moment of
conception and watched myself being
born. That’s why I’m leaving now. When
I needed it, nobody ever put a hand on
my back and told me it was gonna be
alright dude. It’s the little things.
Security senses she isn’t a threat but is still holding her,
or at least blocking her from going anywhere and she’s
stumbling, backed up against the speakers with nowhere to go.
Faint response. People are alarmed. Becky is fading.
She takes a guitar and tries to play but it’s impossible with
her hands cuffed and she spins the guitar, falls hard off the
stage into the equipment area and people rush to her, huddle
around and she’s clutching the guitar which broke her fall.
Feedback starts to wail.
Becky isn’t laughing or talking. She looks up at people, her
eyes like a dying animal and she looks like someone waking up
from amnesia and finally understanding where she is. A little
girl, lost and afraid. She reacts with shaky fear.
Feedback is still wailing and the video camera is in her face
and flash photos are going off and security is trying to pick
her up but she’s like a protestor, heavy and inert.
He lifts Becky, guitar and all. She’s dead weight as she is
carried through the venue to the exit, toward a police car
whose sirens we can already hear and whose red/blue flashing
lights get brighter the further he walks. The look on her
face is fear and panic. Like she just woke up here and
doesn’t know what is happening. Her energy dangerously alive.
Feedback is still wailing, fading away from the stage. Becky
looks at the faces of the Akergirls as she passes. They are
next to Howard and Becky is all bloody and weak.
BECKY (CONT’D)
(quiet, pause before, a
big sense of ceremony)
Sometimes I don’t even own myself.
Mom?
With that, she stares, eyes wide open as if trying to process
a world, a realm of reality she doesn’t comprehend and is
carried in the arms of security out the door into the
waiting, wailing bright lights of oblivion.

79.
People look around, back at the stage. They see The Akergirls
and Howard off to the side. There is still feedback which
Dottie puts a stop to as Howard draws the club’s little
curtain down, concealing them from view.
END OF ACT THREE.
INTERLUDE #4 (1 1/2 YEARS BEFORE ACT 1)
GRAINY VHS HOME MOVIE FOOTAGE: Backyard of Becky’s new house.
It’s nice and has a pool. Becky, in a pool chair, holds a 6week old Tama. She is smoking a cigarette and dozing.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I wanna stay home with my baby. No
tour. No record. I like it here.
Danny shows up, around the corner. He looks confused about
why a camera is there. Becky doesn’t look up at him.
DANNY
Oh. I see. You ready for me to take
her home?
BECKY
Take her. Take her. I’m so tired.
ACT FOUR: BEIGE/SUPER STATIC UNMOVING TABLEAUS
38

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

38

Soft, breeze blown curtains. A big, empty, isolated, somewhat
dilapidated house with windows open. Glowing, soft light is
everywhere and this looks like a cartoon idea of heaven,
contrasting with the red hell we just left behind of Act 3.
Becky is dwarfed by the huge space. Paint is chipped and
peeling, floorboards warped and scuffed. She bought a fixer
upper and will never fix it up.
This is going to be slow, static, locked off. (So even though
this is half the page length of other acts, it’ll be roughly
the same amount of time.)
The camera never moves and seldom cuts. Becky’s life is
immobile now. She’s in a thin, soft sweater over a tattered
old Evergreen College shirt. Beyond natural. No makeup. Soft
clean hair. The mask of theatricality is no more. Looking at
her, you’d almost think she’d been lobotomized.
Becky Something doesn’t live here. Just Rebecca Adamczyk.
The tea kettle boils and whistles in the kitchen.

80.
39

COUNTRY HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

39

Becky oozes out of a stupor and floats like a ghost to the
kitchen. It has signs of detox: dozens of lemons, ginger,
jugs of expensive water. This is all slow: feel time passing.
Becky pours the water and marks a tally on what is obviously
a sobriety calendar: it’s approaching a full year.
She borders on catatonic and the silence here at this point
in our story is extreme and shocking as anything. We’ve heard
nearly two minutes of it which is one minute fifty seconds
more than we ever heard so far. It’s haunting and you should
think that Becky is dead, this is the afterlife, and this
story is going someplace unexpected.
From where her tea steeps, Becky sees a car pull up. She
turns away and prepares to have to see somebody.
40

COUNTRY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

40

Walking through a room with a bunch of South American
religious artifacts, crystals, new age stuff and a pin ball
machine, Becky sits and waits for the knock on the door.
Danny enters with Tama. He looks pretty sharp, hair a bit
cleaner, clothes more sophisticated. Tama is now four and a
half. She doesn’t seem comfortable here, since the place is
so empty and not homey.
The tea is in her hand and the silence is broken by the tea
timer ringing. She removes the tea basket and, though it is
dripping, puts it on a table with no dish.
Becky and Tama look at each other for a moment. Becky’s stoic
face finally changes into a smile.
BECKY
(horse voice, weird
sounding)
Baby.
Mommy.

TAMA

They hug. Becky swallows her tragedy because the pain of
confronting the reality of how bad she fucked up kills her.
BECKY
Momma missed you.
TAMA
I missed momma.

81.
Becky is dying inside. This is agony.
DANNY
Kiddo, mom and dad need to talk. Do
you want to play pinball?
Yeah okay!

TAMA

There is already a Tama stool by the machine for her monthly
visits. She begins to play. The game noises are soft and
fading as Becky and Danny walk to another big, sparse room.
41

COUNTRY HOUSE, MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

41

This one is full of instruments and simple, vintage recording
gear to prove that Becky is still active. Like the other
rooms, it has big open windows and feels quiet and soft and
in addition to pinball, you hear birds and bugs and wind.
Becky cannot make eye contact with Danny, ashamed and full of
self loathing. But she isn’t fully broken. Always, embers of
danger are within her, and the threat is there.
You see it on Danny’s face. He isn’t sure she can stay sober
forever, but is impressed as this is the longest she has
gone. This year came after a relapse or two. It’s about
sixteen months since Act 3.
Becky, in recovering addict mode, can feel people looking for
cracks when they are with her. It feels awful. She holds her
tea in both hands, like it will shield her.
DANNY
You look good.
BECKY
Bullshitter.
Silence.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I have a year next week.
DANNY
I know. That’s really great.
Silence.
DANNY (CONT’D)
She’s been asking about you all the
time.

82.
BECKY
She misses me?
DANNY
She doesn’t really know you.
Immediately, this makes Becky choke up, but no tears. She’s
too isolated from her emotions for tears.
DANNY (CONT’D)
She has no memory of living with you.
Becky pauses, composes herself.
BECKY
I had this dream. We were brothers in
a past life and we were Native
American. You killed all the children
in our tribe. And that’s why I was so
horrible to you in this life.
Danny cannot fathom a response to this. He reaches into a bag
and hands her legal looking documents.
DANNY
Before I forget.
Becky takes it and tosses onto a table without studying.
DANNY (CONT’D)
You need to look at those.
I will.

BECKY

DANNY
Today. I’m taking them back with me.
BECKY
Does it make a difference.
DANNY
Yes. It does.
BECKY
Including you, do you know how many
lawsuits I have against me?
Yes. I do.

DANNY

BECKY
Care to say it out loud.

83.
DANNY
Would it make a difference?
BECKY
Settling with M and A. Child support.
Breach of contract. Contracts.
Promoters. Howard. I’ve lost track.
DANNY
Don’t lump us in with all of that.
Pinball noises. A reminder of Tama.
BECKY
There’s nothing left. They gave me my
band name in exchange for publishing.
I don’t own my own music. I’m broke. I
can’t give you anything.
DANNY
I don’t want you to sell the house.
But I need to know half of whatever
dollars you find go to Tama.
BECKY
I can’t leave this house. I can’t go
back into the world.
A moment of silence. She sips her tea. Becky seems afraid.
She talks of leaving the house like she is in a horror movie.
DANNY
Mari’s here.
BECKY
Excuse me what?
DANNY
She drove up with me.
BECKY
You shouldn’t have done that.
DANNY
It’s okay. She just wants to talk.
BECKY
She took everything I built.
DANNY
She didn’t take it. You lost it. And
besides you built it together.

84.
BECKY
(thinking)
I can’t see her like this.
DANNY
She’s seen worse.
BECKY
Why did you do it. Why did you bring
her?
DANNY
She’s sober too. She’s been through
it. She understands.
Becky looks out the window and sees Mari waiting by the car.
Holding a gift. At least bringing her in ends this talk.
BECKY
I need a minute. Go get her and count
to a hundred.
Danny stands, exits. We stay on Becky, stiff, thinking. After
a moment, Tama comes running in.
TAMA
Momma? I lost my three balls.
Becky picks her up, standing herself.
BECKY
Oof. You’re getting big, kiddo. What’s
daddy feeding you?
TAMA
Chicken fingers and fish fingers.
BECKY
Yum. I wish I had some of those.
TAMA
And noodles.
BECKY
Oh boy. Well I don’t know if have any
of that but if you’re not too big
maybe we can can you peanut butter and
jelly if that’s okay.
TAMA
‘eanut butter!
BECKY
Alright alright!

85.
It’s fun and shocking for this normal mom/kid moment. Becky
puts Tama down. Tama runs to the piano and taps keys.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Careful baby.
Becky is finding herself choked up by this all. It’s coming
to the surface and she is trying to keep it inside, sort of.
TAMA
Play me a song mommy.
BECKY
(she sits on piano bench)
What kind of a song?
TAMA
A song that reminds you of me.
Static. Still, from far away: we see the two of them, Becky,
posed and ready at the piano. She rolls her head back.
BECKY
A song that makes me think of you.
Hrmmm...okay. You ready?
Ready-o!

TAMA

And just for this moment, it’s too bad that Becky has an
audience of one because what she is about to deliver is the
most achingly beautiful, soul-deep performance of maybe her
entire life. And if she were to be playing this for an
audience of 10,000, there wouldn’t be a dry eye in the house.
It’s deep, tender, emotional. From a place deep within
herself where the pure love lives. The love so deep it was
protected from all the drugs, pain and misery she caused
herself and others. It’s closer to a hymn, filling up a
church with tones of reverie and spiritual meaning and the
reason she can muster all that is because it’s all for Tama.
One of the best songs ever written: HEAVEN by Bryan Adams.
BECKY
This next one’s a cover.
Piano keys tap out the sublime first notes of the song. Wind
up to lyrics. Bum da bum bum bum. Bum da bum bum bum.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Oh thinking about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
(MORE)

86.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Now nothing can take you away from me
We’ve been down that road before, but
that’s over now.
You keep me coming back for more.
Baby you’re all that I want.
When you’re lying here in my arms.
I’m finding it hard to believe.
We’re in heaven.
And love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn’t too hard to see.
We’re in heaven.
Oh once in your life you find someone.
Who will turn your world around.
Bring you up when you’re feeling down.
Yeah nothing can change what you mean to me.
There’s lots that I could say.
But just hold me now.
Cause our love will light the way.
(Tama holds onto Becky now, arms around her waist.)
Baby you’re all that I want.
When you’re lying here in my arms. I’m
finding it hard to believe.
We’re in heaven.
Yeah love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn’t too hard to see. We’re in heaven.
I’ve been waiting for so long.
For something to arrive.
For love to come along.
Now our dreams are coming true.
Through the good times and the bad.
Yeah I’ll be standing there by you.
And baby you’re all that I want. When
you’re lying here in my arms. I’m
finding it hard to believe.
We’re in heaven.
And love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart. It
wasn’t too hard to see.
We’re in heaven.
One shot. This is the most amazing performance of Heaven by
Bryan Adams that you have ever heard or will ever hear.
The emotion is unfathomable. Becky has never given anything
as much as she is giving this.

87.
Tama loves it, bobs her head the whole time and when the song
ends and we finally cut to see Danny and Mari standing in the
door, he looks like he’s never seen anything like this and
Mari just saw for the first time in a decade the Becky she
first knew and Mari, like every viewer watching this scene,
is crying right now.
Becky kisses Tama. She heard them come in and knew they were
there the whole time. She doesn’t turn to face them.
Hey M.

BECKY (CONT’D)

MARI
(swallowing a lump)
Hey B.
The room opens up when Becky takes Tama in her lap and turns.
TAMA
Aunt Mari did you hear? Mom sang a
song just for me.
MARI
Yeah. I heard.
TAMA
You should sing for me too sometime.
MARI
I will. Promise.
Danny is moved. This represents a total change in Becky.
MARI (CONT’D)
Been playing anything else?
BECKY
Uh huh. You wanna hear?
MARI
Yeah. I do.
DANNY
Sweetie, why don’t you come fix lunch
with daddy?
TAMA
Mom said she’d make me a sandwich.
BECKY
Dad can get this one. I’ll make the
next one.

88.
TAMA
Okay momma but you have to make the
next one.
Tama kisses Becky and runs to Danny, who swoops her up. He
looks at Becky and Mari, knowing they should be alone. He
exits.
Mari and Becky feel it out. They haven’t seen one another in
coming up on three years.
MARI
She’s so beautiful.
BECKY
I lost so much time with her.
MARI
She’s lucky to have you back.
BECKY
I had a vision of you holding her at
my funeral. I saw you and Danny,
holding her hands and I was so happy
that you were godmother. I’ve seen my
death a dozen times in a dozen
different ways. In every vision I’m
surrounded by people. I never die
alone.
MARI
You’re alone now. You should leave
this place.
BECKY
There’s an ache in my bones.
Mari takes a minute. This is a crushing thing to respond to.
She sits down near the piano. Puts the present she has been
holding down. Becky looks at it, devoid of curiosity.
MARI
It’s from Howard.
BECKY
Thanks Howard. How’s he doing?
MARI
Well, actually. The Akergirls hit big.
Their new stuff isn’t my cup of tea
but they’ve done well for him. He’d
love to see you.
Becky squirms. Wants to change the subject.

89.
BECKY
Thank you for taking my call. Back
then. You didn’t have to.
MARI
I was always the bigger person.
BECKY
Ali didn’t.
MARI
You never tried to stab me. Except in
the back. Which you did.
BECKY
How’s she been?
MARI
Good. She just put out an album with
her husband. It’s kinda great.
Husband?

BECKY

MARI
Roy. They’re amazing together.
BECKY
I should get a copy.
MARI
Mine’s out in the car.
BECKY
I’ll buy my own.
MARI
I don’t think she’s mad at you
anymore. I don’t think I’m mad at you
anymore either. You were horrible. But
it never made me not love you.
Becky nods. Insulted, but Mari had to get it out.
MARI (CONT’D)
Lauren’s seven months pregnant.
BECKY
Danny told me. That’s rad. I’m happy
for you.
(pause)
You’ll be a really good mom.
Silence. This is getting harder, not easier.

90.
MARI
You ever jam?
BECKY
Alone. A lot.
You wanna?

MARI

Nobody has offered Becky this much of an inch of opportunity
in years. It’s major for her and you see it in her eyes. She
tries to downplay how much it means to be given a shot.
BECKY
Sure. You wanna hear some stuff?
MARI
(equally downplaying)
Sure.
For a moment, it’s almost old times. Sisterhood and creative
energy between them. Becky goes to the reel to reel she has
been using to record demos in exile.
It plays out slowly. Becky moving, having finished her tea,
the precision of somebody whose brain isn’t quite right. She
cues up the device and hesitates before pressing play. Looks
over her shoulder and off in the distance sees Tama lurking
in a far off door frame holding a triangle PB&J sandwich
half. Danny is behind her, maintaining Becky and Mari’s
distance and space.
Becky looks back to Mari, slumps down, on the floor,
surrounded by instruments and gear.
BECKY
Don’t like, tell people anything about
what you hear.
MARI
I wouldn’t--BECKY
Just...if anybody asks. Does anybody
ask?
MARI
(pause)
Not as much as they used to.
BECKY
It’s okay. Only...be kind, alright?

91.
Becky never expressed any sensitivity or need for approval,
not once in their entire career together so Mari knows it’s
actually a different person, draped in soft fabric hanging
off her lithe, weakened frame. The ghost of Becky future.
MARI
Just between us.
Becky presses play and sits with her back to Mari: she can’t
hear her own recording while playing and look her in the eye.
Two women, facing forward, Becky holding her guitar, Mari
staring at Becky’s back.
The song starts. It’s simple, raw, rough, emotional, and
pure. Becky accompanies the recording, strumming and also
singing live. The record is a 4-track, simple stuff. It’s
short and is, as the critics would say, Classic Becky.
(This song is called ‘Expected to Grow’ and was written by
Alicia Bognanno/aka Bully)
BECKY
Slipping out
I’ve caused you pain
I shake at the thought of it
Anyone could shift the blame
But I’m the root the cause of it
I don’t think I’ve learned
Anything since you
Taking ten steps back
Polarize the view
And how can I be expected to grow
If I’m stuck living in what I
Already know and
I don’t wanna quit
I just wanna be in control of it
I don’t wanna quit
I just wanna be in control of it
What I recall
Is cold and mean
I owe good health and time to you
But I get stuck
To the wrong things
And only space shows me the truth
I have not learned
I have learned nothing since you
Taking ten steps back
Polarize the truth
It’s clear to Mari that this is exactly what they were trying
to make in Act 2, a return to form that is also a leap
forward. Somehow, Becky exorcised the demons and created it.

92.
MARI
Beck it’s incredible.
BECKY
Just a little thing.
Mari looks and see stacks of recordings around the machine.
Becky has enough for a double album and four bootlegs here.
An epic amount of music. She sees Mari looking.
BECKY (CONT’D)
It’s mostly junk.
MARI
You know I’d follow you anywhere.
Still?

BECKY

MARI
That’s my bad habit. Yours is, well,
everything. Mine is coming back and
coming back for more.
BECKY
I fucked you over a hundred times.
MARI
Hundred and one.
BECKY
I don’t know if I can let people hear
this. I think it’s just too, too, just
too much.
Yeah okay.

MARI

BECKY
I don’t deserve another chance.
MARI
You’re gonna get it whether you want
to or not. You’re lucky I’m a
masochist who, still, just wants to
get dressed up, feel pretty and play
new music plus the hits. They still
love you.
BECKY
They always loved me. It’s not loving
them back that got me here.

93.
MARI
So what? You stay here and die in this
house?
BECKY
I always thought I’d die on stage.
There’s nothing here than can hurt me.
I have to stay here, or else...
MARI
It’s not over until you get what’s
yours.
BECKY
Somehow I’ve cheated it. It’s very
real. It wasn’t that time, so maybe
it’ll be next time. So there can’t
ever be a next time.
MARI
Becky that’s insane.
BECKY
No. It isn’t. Ya-Ema once told me that
Tama would be my downfall. I thought
he meant she would bring my downfall.
It wasn’t until later that I realized
he meant my love for her is my true
weakness.
MARI
I don’t buy any of that. And you
shouldn’t still talk about him. He’s a
fraud. He took advantage of you and
lots of others and he’s in jail now
for it.
BECKY
He understood me.
MARI
Okay whatever. You don’t need him and
you never did. You never knew how to
rely on others. That’s your weakness.
People are waiting to see who Becky
Something really is.
BECKY
Who is she?
Mari smiles and makes an ‘I don’t know’ shrug.
MARI
She’s a woman.

94.
BECKY
She’s a user.
MARI
She’s a mother.
BECKY
She’s a deadbeat.
A person.
A persona.

MARI
BECKY

MARI
You’re healthy.
BECKY
Recovering.
MARI
Okay then. Who was Becky Something?
BECKY
A way to hide from Rebecca Adamczyk.
MARI
Who was she?
BECKY
I dunno. Nobody’s seen her since I was
sixteen.
Tama comes in, interrupting. Leaps at Becky.
TAMA
Momma I’m bored.
BECKY
I know sweetheart. Mommy’s just
catching up with Aunt Mari.
TAMA
Can we go outside to play?
BECKY
Yeah. Let’s go outside.
They stand up and slowly get together. Mari knows this
conversation is over but the seed has been planted. Offer is
on the table.

95.
Danny joins from the kitchen as they walk to the door which
leads to the backyard.
42

EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

42

This is the first time in this story we have been outside and
it’s shocking. Vampiric. Becky shrinks a little and adjusts
her eyes, breaths fresh air, reacts to nature. We’ve never
seen her outdoors, ever. Tama runs off into the yard.
Danny puts his hand on Becky’s shoulder as they watch Tama
lovingly and he gives her a small look of acceptance and
reassurance and that’s all she ever wanted.
Becky steps away from it and into the light and walks off the
porch into the yard and follows Tama into a thicket of trees
and lets the sun light and wind and all the rest wash over
her and her clothes are flowing and she looks like a ghost in
a movie whose spirit is finally let go and dissolves or
evaporates into the air.
It has that eerie vibe about it.
END OF ACT FOUR.
INTERLUDE #5 (No context)
GRAINY VHS HOME MOVIE FOOTAGE: Becky, Mari and Ali are
collapsed in delirious laughter on the floor in front of a
paper photo shoot backdrop. This is the photo shoot for the
Spin cover from Interlude 1.
Their faces are turning red, they are gasping for air as they
laugh: just them together, physically, emotionally, having
fun and loving being in a band. The Best of Times.
ACT FIVE: BLUE&GREEN/STEADICAM
43

INT. THE VENUE, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM

43

The same venue from Act One. Same camera patterns with
lighting that starts off different, a transition from the
balanced, calming hues of Act 4 back to the familiar neon
buzz of Act One. This is the end of a full circle.
Becky looks different: classy and kind of amazing. She has a
stylist now and wears designer-ish clothes. Her hair is cool
and her makeup is mature and appropriate without being a
departure from her true style.
Becky is alone, bouncing about like a pinball. We feel the
anxiety and confusion of this experience.

96.
She is about to re-enter the public eye and this is the final
moment to herself before the final moments of Becky’s story.
Everything here, every image, gesture, word and suggestion
point towards a definitive conclusion. It’s looming.
Stay with her as she appreciates the quiet but see also how
wrecked with anxiety she is. It feels like she may be about
to snap. You faintly hear a concert happening already.
Knock on the door. Becky breaths deep. It’s all now or never.
Yeah.

BECKY

Ali and Mari come in. Obviously they’ve been practicing and
stuff so this isn’t the reunion but it’s a reunion of the
public personas and that feels substantial.
The women circle one another, silent, smiling, looking at
their stage outfits.
ALI
So bitchin’, babe.
BECKY
Thank you.
(she curtseys)
Mari is happy and not hiding it; she brought this together.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Is this a mistake.
MARI
Nope. It feels good.
Becky looks to Ali for backup.
ALI
It’s pretty alright.
Another knock. It’s a PHOTOGRAPHER with the event. Howard is
with him and beams with pride at seeing the gang back
together. He has on a suit and tie. He has flowers for Becky.
He kisses them all on the cheeks and hands. Hands her the
flowers.
HOWARD
You all look incredible. Thank you.
Really, thanks for doing this.

97.
BECKY
Christ Goodman, we’re not Lady Lazarus
the damn Phoenix.
HOWARD
It’s my night. You tried hard as you
could to torpedo my business but
somehow the company has survived for
twenty years so let me throw a living
wake.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Anybody mind if we get a few quick
photos?
ALI
Ahhhh, so that’s why you’re here.
HOWARD
You don’t think I actually wanted to
see any of you?
They all push back against a wall and pose, Howard and Becky
in the middle. Smiles all around. Show Mari, Ali and Becky’s
faces as the flashes go off. Holding smiles. Faking it. Like
King Kong having his photo taken. Feel the pressure on Becky
as the press and the publicity machine begins to consume her.
PHOTOGRAPHER
That’s it. Thanks.
He exits.
HOWARD
See you out there?
Uh huh.

MARI

HOWARD
(to Becky)
It means a lot to me that you’re here.
I mean it. I’m nearly speechless.
BECKY
Not nearly enough ya big sap. Get
outta here. Tonight’s not about me.
Howard exits and pauses at the door.
HOWARD
Why couldn’t you be this smart ten
years ago?

98.
BECKY
I never thought I’d live this long and
wanted to avoid it.
HOWARD
See you ladies on stage.
BECKY
Hey. Thanks for sticking by me.
HOWARD
There was never a question.
Mari blows a kiss and Ali waves with both hands. You can hear
the current band finish, yell ‘THANK YOU AND THANK YOU
HOWARD’ and applause and they exit the stage.
Mari and Ali are noticing how jittery and on edge Becky is.
You okay?

ALI

BECKY
Yeah’m. Yeah. Fine. It’s iffy and it’s
odd being back. Do you hear the
ghosts? The bones and chains rattling?
Do you feel the spirits of the past?
MARI
It’s different. This space is the same
but we’re different.
BECKY
I’ve never seen it sober before.
ALI
I told you. It sucks.
INT. THE VENUE, BECKY'S DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
It’s the Akergirls and they just got off the stage so they
are sweaty but very awesome looking. They too have matured
styles, even though they are still like 26. Super chic, no
longer rocker slobbish. Like Zelda in Act 1, they’ve found
the art crowd and have even done advertising campaigns. They
sit in the front at some fashion shows now.
BECKY
Oh fuck looky here.
All hug, smiles, kisses.

99.
CASSIE
Shit you look ah-may-zing.
BECKY
Still breathing.
CASSIE
That must be it.
DOTTIE
Look at this hair.
BECKY
Alright alright you’re making me feel
like a specimen.
ROXIE
We like, ran from the stage when we
heard you were here.
BECKY
How’re things?
ROXIE
Our new record just came out.
BECKY
I know. It’s the best one yet.
DOTTIE
Everybody says the one we made
together is the best.
BECKY
That’s because they’re assholes who
don’t want artists to change. I’m
serious. It’s on repeat. I love it.
Thank you.

CASSIE

ROXIE
What about you? Doing anything after
this?
Tonight?

MARI

ROXIE
No, like in the futurrre, man.
Something She look at one another....elephant in the room.
Becky averts her eyes.

100.
MARI
Ahhhh. Um--ALI
Unknown. We’re here for Howard. Just
trying to get through tonight.
DOTTIE
Yeah how crazy is this? Did you see
Zelda’s here?
(looks at Becky)
Shit, sorry. I forgot.
BECKY
It’s fine. We’ve spoken. She heard
what I had to say. Actually: she still
around?
CASSIE
Down the hall.
BECKY
Maybe this means something. Excuse me.
Becky exits swiftly. The room is quiet for a moment.
ALI
It’s great to see you girls. I’m glad
you’re here for this.
She looks at Roxie and Dottie, who are warm and affectionate.
DOTTIE
Yeah man. Life goes on.
CASSIE
It’s amazing to see you together. She
looks like she’s doing great.
MARI
I think she is.
CASSIE
You know there’s like, a lot of shit
around tonight. She cool with that?
ALI
Probably maybe. Hopefully.
ROXIE
People are getting real fucked up.
ALI
We’ll keep an eye on her.

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - THAT SAME MOMENT

44

Becky looks at the doors. None have individual names, all
just say ‘Talent’ so she peeks into some open ones and
finally finds an ajar one and knocks on it.
45

INT. THE VENUE, OTHER DRESSING ROOM

45

A tattooed girl and a few guys are inside: the girl is VIVVY
and she knows Becky, of course. Vivvy is equally cool, but
night and day from Becky. Dark hair, dark look.
VIVVY
Becky, whoa fuck you look awesome.
BECKY
Hey Vivvy. Thought you’d be here.
VIVVY
Yeah for Howard. Right?
Right on.

BECKY

Becky looks past Vivvy into a room with people around a table
with booze and drugs and joints and so on.
VIVVY
You wanna hang?
BECKY
(in a trance, almost)
Uhhhhhh. No. No. I’m, um, I’m good.
I’m just Zelda?
VIVVY
She’s partying with us. Just stepped
out. Wait for her.
Becky looks at the drugs.
BECKY
No. I can’t. Just tell her I’m
looking.
VIVVY
It’s great to see you. You doing the
thing after?
BECKY
Maybe. Probably not. My daughter’s
here.

102.
VIVVY
How’s Tama?
BECKY
She’s good. She’s big. Almost seven.
VIVVY
I wanna see her.
BECKY
Yeah sure. I’ll find you.
Becky exits, starting to be disoriented.
46

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

46

She is losing her focus in the hallway which is full of crowd
noises and the deja vu and the drugs are putting her on edge.
She hasn’t been around drugs since getting clean.
There’s a circular disorienting moment where Becky gets light
headed. She pauses and then resumes looking for Zelda.
She opens Vivvy’s door again, confused.
VIVVY
Change your mind?
BECKY
Oh, uh no. Sorry I didn’t realize this
was...yeah sorry.
She closes the door and walks off and just as she does Zelda
is coming towards her.
Zelda looks incredible and is wearing some giant floor length
gown/cape thing which is extreme and would look not absurd on
exactly four people on earth and she is one of them.
ZELDA
Becky Something. As I live and breath.
BECKY
(flustered, eternally
uncool next to Zelda)
Zee. Hey. I was uh, I’s looking for
you.
ZELDA
What’s it all about? Are you guys on
soon? I’ll be honest, I never thought
I’d see the day.

103.
BECKY
You and me both, girl.
ZELDA
You look good. Really good.
Ummmmm...

BECKY

ZELDA
Looking for me?
BECKY
Oh, uh. I mean you can say no and you
probably will but I’m going to have a
little seance right now. Very pure,
really find a clearing on my path
before we go, like, do this thing. I
know it’s just this song and I know
it’s not about me but I want some
women around me to help--She is rambling. Zelda gets it and tries to sooth Becky.
ZELDA
Relax. I’d love to. Everything’s cool.
Time passes.
They turn and start walking to Becky’s dressing room. They
walk in silence, Zelda nearly floating on whatever special
air she breaths and Becky, shorter and more anxious than
Zelda has ever been. They enter Something She’s room.
47

THE VENUE, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

47

Becky moves her fingers like a conductor but she is summoning
all the women into a circle. She puts her hands down,
motioning for everybody to take one another’s hands.
Becky starts setting up. Her belief in mysticism is still
powerful. She places small items, crystals, rocks, glass, in
the hands of all the women, puts ribbons on them and drapes a
cloth over a stool in the center. She lights some smoking
thing atop it. She has formed a prayer circle.
Everybody eyes one another silently, going with it. It’s
reminiscent of AA where people take hands. It shows Becky’s
belief in powers and a program that has worked for her.
Focus on Becky as she does finishing touches. It’s clear: she
is feeling weak right now and is putting this on to support
herself in a time of crisis. The circle nears completion.
Becky takes her place between Mari and Ali.

104.
One by one, we see the faces of the six other women, starting
and ending with Becky. They look at one another with
confidence, dedication, style and togetherness. Becky takes a
final silent pause, closes her eyes, and others follow suit.
Becky is humming, some form of Ya-Ema’s chanting. Nobody
joins. But after a moment, Becky speaks up.
BECKY
I am Rebecca Adamczyk. I rely on the
strength of others for support. Thank
you all for being here with me.
Silence. Then:
MARI
I am Mary Louise Heller. I am here for
you. Thank you all for being here with
me.
ALI
I’m Alexandra Derringer. I am here for
you. Thank you all for being here with
me.
CASSIE
I am Caroline Schlesinger. I am here
for you Thank you all for being here
with me.
DOTTIE
I am Danielle Zakien. I am here for
you. Thank you all for being here with
me.
ROXIE
I am Rochelle White. I am here for
you. Thank you all for being here with
me.
ZELDA
I am Zelda Ellen Benson-Hartman. I am
here for you. Thank you all for being
here with me.
One face to another. Ritualistic. Calm and beautiful, to see
these women together, no energy, no attitude. After a moment:
DOTTIE
Your name really is Zelda?
Uh huh.

ZELDA

105.
DOTTIE
Fuck that’s so cool.
Everybody laughs, smiles, except Becky, who is still
thinking. Open their eyes. Enjoy the feeling this has given.
Becky looks like she is about to say something but closes her
mouth. She turns to leave the room and gives everybody a warm
look. Finally, at the last moment, she turns back.
BECKY
No matter what happens next, thank you
for letting me be who I am. I’ve tried
and I’ve tried and I’ve tried and you
all stuck with me. Until the very end.
Becky exits. The women are still feeling good.
ZELDA
I should finish getting ready. Thanks
for letting me crash. I know I wasn’t
always front row at the Becky Show.
ALI
C’mon. You’ve been backstage at the
Becky Show.
Zelda blows double kisses with both hands and exits.
ZELDA
See you in a few.
ROXIE
We should change. Still all gross.
DOTTIE
We’re watching your set though.
CASSIE
Oh shit, yeah. That’s the one thing I
absolutely can’t miss tonight.
MARI
Hope we don’t disappoint.
Never!

CASSIE

ALI
(breaking out of a
thoughtful silence)
What do you think she meant by ‘until
the very end’?

106.
ROXIE
It’s just a thing people say.
ALI
Yeah. Maybe.
MARI
What? You think...?
ALI
I mean what did we just do? What did
Becky want from us?
CASSIE
Strength to overcome?
ALI
Uh huh. Or?
MARI
No. She...she’s...not now.
ALI
I hope you’re right.
48

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - THAT SAME MOMENT

48

Zelda is walking down the hall. A roadie approaches her.
RANDOM ROADIE
Miss Z, can I get you anything?
ZELDA
No, thank you.
RANDOM ROADIE
If you need anything, don’t hesitate
to ask.
ZELDA
Thank you, sweetheart.
Zelda floats away: Becky as she could have been. All the
fame, the talent, none of the problems.
Zelda turns a corner and sees Danny, Tiffany (with round
pregnant belly), Ania with Tama, Lauren and Ali’s husband ROY
(scruffy fellow with a beard). Another roadie is showing them
to a private area to watch the show.
Danny!

ZELDA (CONT’D)

107.

Zelda. Hi.

DANNY

OTHER ROADIE
Talent only, that way.
ZELDA
They’re with me.
They hug and Lauren and Zelda give a more intimate hello,
showing that in the last five years they hang out sometimes.
ZELDA (CONT’D)
(to Ania)
You must be Becky’s mother. From down
the hall I thought you were her.
Oh stop.

ANIA

ZELDA
True story.
Zelda is so charming and makes people so happy.
DANNY
You remember my wife, Tiffany.
ZELDA
Congratulations.
Thank you.

TIFFANY

ZELDA
How’s radio, Dirtbag?
DANNY
Ha. Good. Merging with competition.
Payout. Can’t complain. You seen the
girls?
ZELDA
I just came from their room. You want
me to show where it is?
DANNY
I think I remember the way.
LAUREN
They’re taking us to the balcony.

108.
ZELDA
Nonsense. Watch from back here. C’mon,
let me take you.
(to roadie)
It’s fine. I’ve got them.
She leads the group back where she came from.
ZELDA (CONT’D)
(to Roy)
I’m Zelda.
Roy.

ROY

ZELDA
Ali is such a beautiful singer. I
always knew. I love the record you two
did.
ROY
Ah. You’re the one.
ZELDA
Stop. It’s marvelous. Really. And here
you are. See you all soon.
She stops at the dressing room and keeps walking, exiting.
49

INT. THE VENUE, DRESSING ROOM

49

Back into the Something She room. Only Mari is here. She sees
the group and wonders what’s going on.
MARI
Everything okay?
LAUREN
Plus ones looking for plus funs.
ANIA
Where’s Rebecca?
Mari kisses Ania hello, same to Danny.
MARI
Hey Tiffany. Congrats.
(to Tama)
Hi darling.
Aunt Mari!

TAMA

109.
MARI
She went to unwind or something before
we play.
DANNY
Which is when?
MARI
Ten minutes?
Nobody is as concerned as they were in Acts 1, 2 and 3. And
the lack of concern makes people concerned.
MARI (CONT’D)
She’s probably meditating or
something.
The first roadie comes in, clipboard in hand.
RANDOM ROADIE
Eight minutes until Something She.
MARI
Eight? Jeez okay let me go look for
her. Um, you all wait here.
50

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

50

Mari walks to another room, quickly, with purpose and worry.
51

THE VENUE, CATERING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ali is here with Vivvy at a table of food, wine, champagne
and other celebratory provisions. It’s lavishly catered.
Mari. Hey.

VIVVY

MARI
Hey V. You guys seen Becky?
ALI
Not since she left.
I saw her.
When?

VIVVY
MARI

VIVVY
Like two minutes ago. In our room.

51

110.
MARI
But you’re here.
VIVVY
Yeah I left.
MARI
Right but when?
ALI
What’s going on?
MARI
Nothing. I mean, come with me?
Excuse us.

ALI

They exit the room and we follow them.
52

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
ALI
I’m sure it’s fine.
MARI
You see how stoned Vivvy was?
ALI
So? That’s Vivvy.
MARI
Becky shouldn’t be hanging with her.
ALI
I think they just said hey.
MARI
It’s not good to be around that.
ALI
C’mon. Give her the benefit. She’s
probably in our room.
MARI
Was just there. That’s why I’m here.
ALI
She’s somewhere else then. Relax.
You’re nervous about the show.

52

111.
MARI
You’re probably right. It’s nuts that
we’re here at all.
ALI
No kidding.
They share a brief moment of victory and pride in the journey
that has led them to this point.
Instantly, Howard appears around a corner with a champagne
bottle.
HOWARD
Have we lost Becky already?
MARI
And that is the big question of the
moment.
HOWARD
I’ll have a stroke! I was joking.
Goddamnit not this again ahhh
sonofabitch where is she?
MARI
Around. Relaxing, we assume.
ALI
Zelda said we could switch with her if
we need more time.
HOWARD
One smooth night. After all these
years is that too much?
ALI
I’m sure she’s back by now.
HOWARD
I’ll say hello to Danny.
They walk back to the Something She dressing room. Vivvy
crosses opposite with several others loopy and in party mode.
Mari studies this: she doesn’t like how the signs are piling
up. There’s a chill, a tension here that walking behind
Howard, Mari and Ali express to one another.

112.
53

THE VENUE, DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

53

This is all getting very fast again. We’re heading back to
the speed of Act 1. Present in the room: Ali, Mari, Howard,
Danny, Tiffany, Lauren, Roy.
Everybody looks around. There’s tension mounting. A roadie
pops his head in. Howard puts the bottle down.
RANDOM ROADIE
Five minutes.
HOWARD
Where is she?
DANNY
Tama had to use the bathroom so Ania
said she’d look there.
ALI
With the Akergirls?
HOWARD
Negative. Just saw them.
Vivvy?
Nope.

LAUREN
ALI

TIFFANY
This isn’t because I’m here, is it?
DANNY
We’re long past that.
ROY
Is she already at the stage?
MARI
First time for everything, I guess.
Lauren takes Mari’s hand. Roy takes Ali’s. Everybody is being
silent, trying hard not to say it.
HOWARD
Do we have faith?
MARI
She’s earned it.

113.
ALI
She has. The last few weeks have been
great, actually.
ROY
She stayed with us upstate. It was
rad.
ALI
It’s the old Becky.
DANNY
Which Old Becky, though?
Silence.
MARI
The good one.
ALI
We have to play. So let’s go to the
stage and we’ll find Becky waiting
there.
Ali and Mari lead the group out of the room.
54

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

54

We follow the big train of people.
LAUREN
We’ll let you do your thing.
(to Roy)
Let’s get our seats.
TIFFANY
I’ll come with.
Mari kisses Lauren and they break off with Tiffany, who
kisses Danny, seeing how nervous and unhappy he is.
55

THE VENUE, BEHIND THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

55

Cut away to the back of Becky’s head. Far away. Isolated.
Mysterious. (Act 4 type moment.) It’s slow motion, curious
and different from how the rest of things move here.
We can’t see her face. We drift with her and see that she is
with guitar, strap on shoulder, She is looking out at the
stage as it calls to her for the first time in many years.

114.
From behind Becky, you see the gang approaching. We see her
see them but it’s still far enough away to be mysterious.
Nobody can see her face because she is lit from behind.
56

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

56

Back to the group.
MARI
Holy shit look. She’s there. She’s
ready.
Roadie pops in.
RANDOM ROADIE
Four minutes!
ALI
We were right.
HOWARD
Why is she standing like that?
ALI
She’s nervous. I know I am.
Danny registers something slightly off. He isn’t sure what.
DANNY
She’s nervous. She’s alone.
57

THE VENUE, BEHIND THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

57

Back behind Becky who hasn’t waved or moved yet. It plays
like she might be paralyzed with anxiety and it isn’t until
now, when we see from behind Becky that people are finally
pretty close to her that, one by one, in close up and in slow
motion, we individually see people are they come closer and
Becky steps one step forward into the light.
We see: Howard and Danny. Ali and Mari. Each shows different
emotions, from confusion to relief to uncertainty. Becky
remains far away, backlit by a spotlight.
ALI
We need to go to her.
D--Just us.

HOWARD
MARI

115.
Mari and Ali walk towards Becky. We stay behind, watching the
three women from afar, the perspective of spectators.
Still silent. Still calm. Slow. See people’s reactions again.
This moment is about seeing Danny and Howard. Their faces are
unambiguously ambiguous. Each is certain of something else:
the worst. The best. Nobody knows for sure.
From a distance we see the emotional huddle of Something She.
Becky is shuffling. Mari is strong and confident as she puts
Becky’s head on her shoulder. Ali seems more reluctant to
embrace. It’s not clear what is being said but it is clear
what is happening: they trust one and love one another.
Mari and Ali look Becky in the eyes and clearly she gives a
definitive answer. They pause. Her head is forcefully
nodding, even though she seems wobbly and weak.
Becky and Mari walk back to Howard and Danny.
MARI (CONT’D)
She’ll be fine.
RANDOM ROADIE
Three minutes!
HOWARD
She’ll be fine? What does that mean
she’ll be fine? Is she straight? Is
she messed up? Can she perform?
ALI
She’s good. We’re good.
HOWARD
Find Zelda! See if she can go on.
The roadie runs to find Zelda.
ALI
Zelda isn’t going on now. We are.
Everybody looks at Becky: nervous, by the stage.
Becky looks up as Ania and Tama return from the bathroom. She
pauses: the appearance of her mother and daughter make Becky
freeze. She looks directly at them.
Ania sees her in the backlight, wobbly and loopy. She looks
like she knows something nobody else knows about Becky.
DANNY
Tell me. What does this mean?

116.
MARI
It means what you want it to mean,
Danny boy.
ANIA
Does she-- has she taken anything?
Tama runs from the group over to Becky. We go with her,
swooping towards Becky, getting close, finally.
Becky swoops up Tama, so energized and happy to finally see
her mom play for a crowd. This happiness makes Becky break.
TAMA
I wanna say good luck before your
concert mommy.
She kisses Becky. At this, Becky breaks down. Not into tears
but into herself. It all goes in rather than coming out.
Danny, Ania, Howard, Mari and Ali have all come to Becky now.
She hands Tama to Danny and with the weight of a world of
shame crushing her, faces her supporters.
BECKY
At the end I have to be me. I caused a
lot of pain and I’m sorry. I was so
nervous. I am so nervous. I don’t know
how to go out there like that. All by
myself.
Rambling in her own stream of thoughts, newly laden with
regret, disappointment, sadness and a sense of self awareness
we’ve never seen before. Everybody moves towards her, not
angry, but with love. Ready to embrace her, because that’s
all she ever wanted or needed.
ANIA
All I ever wanted was for you to be
yourself.
The roadie comes back with Zelda.
RANDOM ROADIE
Forty five seconds. Forty five to
show.
Zelda looks at what is happening and tries to catch up.
ZELDA
Oh Becky. Becky, darling. Are you
okay?

117.
BECKY
Things are okay. Things will be okay.
She looks to Mari and Ali. They are there for her.
Everybody is confused, but there’s nothing more to say. There
are no answers here, except one: the show must go on.
RANDOM ROADIE
We are ready for Something She in
Thirty.
Danny and Ania step aside. The band stays together. Zelda is
off to the side by the roadie.
DANNY
We should go.
Leave?

ANIA

DANNY
No. Go watch the show.
They exit. Mari and Ali face Becky. Just the three of them.
Fifteen.

RANDOM ROADIE

MARI
Are we okay?
Becky nods, a little weakly.
RANDOM ROADIE
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
BECKY
Rebecca never went on stage exposed
and alone. She never knew how.
ALI
You’re not on your own.
MARI
You never were on your own.
BECKY
Yeah. Okay.
RANDOM ROADIE
Three, two, one. Show time folks.
That’s a cue for Something She.

118.
He motions to the stage and the house lights go down and a
spotlight hits the on stage microphone.
RANDOM ROADIE (CONT’D)
Howard? Introduce the band.
Howard looks at Becky, unsure what to do.
BECKY
It’s okay. I’m ready to go.
Ali and Mari nod to him to go. Howard steps to the stage and
the perspective of him remains in the wings as he starts
talking. We hear his story while mostly watching Becky, Mari
and Ali hold one another’s hands and faces and get ready.
HOWARD
I first saw this next band...almost
ten, god, no, eleven years ago. They
were opening for, well, it doesn’t
matter who they were opening for
because I left right after their set.
Ran backstage. Dropped to my knees and
begged to let me sign them. And this
woman, this once in a lifetime, never
been anyone like her in the world,
fire brand of a woman, her hair dyed
bright blue, looks down at me, a
desperate pathetic adult man in a
leather jacket and no established
career, a label that I ran out of my
mother’s basement, begging to work
with her. And at this time, she’s a
nobody. Keep in mind, this was maybe
their ninth show. And you know what
she does? She looks me in the eye and
says ‘Who the fuck are you to want to
work with a star like me?’
(CROWD LAUGHTER)
This woman, who had nothing, nobody
even knew her name, made me beg.
Tortured me for months as I pursued
her, followed her, sweetening the
offer until finally she gave me a
chance to talk terms. So we plan to
meet for breakfast. She shows up at
two and I realize we’ve only ever
spoken at shows. The band is hung over
as hell, and I probably was too.
(MORE)

119.
HOWARD (CONT'D)
She sits down and looks me in the eye
after months of making me chase, beg,
everything, she looks at me and she
says ‘who are you again and what is
this about?’
(CROWD LAUGHTER)
We are still on Becky, Ali and Mari. Zelda is behind them.
Becky looks up to the balcony/VIP area at Tama and this gives
her strength to get her head straight, close her eyes and
focus. She gives her head to Ali and Mari and they hold her.
HOWARD (CONT’D)
We’ve been together ever since.
Through the ups, the downs, a friendly
lawsuit or two, but mostly, it’s the
good times I think about. Both of
them.
(CROWD LAUGHTER)
I love and respect the hell out of
these and am proud to call them
family. Please give a Paragon welcome,
together for the first time in nearly
four years: Becky Something, Ali Van
Der Wolff and Marielle Hell. Ladies
and gentlemen: SOMETHING SHE!
The crowd goes insane. It’s unreal to see these women
together again. Howard gestures to the stage and Becky
freezes like a deer in headlights.
She looks out at him, the spotlights, the audience, hears the
applause and she can’t move. Mari and Ali are by her side.
BECKY
Is it today? Is today the day I don’t
make it?
MARI
No. Today is not the day.
ALI
We’re with you.
58

THE VENUE, THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

58

Something She takes the stage and it’s nuts. Totally electric
and you feel the excitement of them being together. It feels
iconic because it really is. People never thought it would
happen, including Mari and Ali.

120.
Becky looks up at Tama, who gives her a big happy thumbs up
and Becky catches it with a kiss and puts it in her pocket.
The applause goes on and it hits Becky as strong as huge dose
of anything she’s ever taken. Whatever she was dealing with,
the anxiety, the years of recovery, it’s nothing compared to
this. She becomes old Becky: arms out receiving the love,
begging for more. Eating it up.
Ali and Mari are beaming and all three embrace for a pre show
pose and flash bulbs are exploding and the stage lighting is
dramatic and colorful and it’s amazing and Becky is really
happy and looks luminescent in the spotlight.
She steps to the microphone.
BECKY
Where ya been?
WILD APPLAUSE.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Oh and thanks Howard for the bullshit
story because I don’t remember it
happening like that at all.
Side of the stage: Howard laughs and finds another mic.
HOWARD
Do you remember it at all?
BECKY
I do remember the blue hair.
(LAUGHTER FROM CROWD)
Oh but what to say what to say what to
say! Okay so I know this is all about
Howard but I’ve heard enough kind
things about him to last a lifetime
and those are the ones he says about
himself.
(LAUGHTER FROM CROWD)
So I dunno what else is there?
(MORE)

121.
BECKY (CONT'D)
I used to think of myself as an island
and it took me a lifetime to realize
that without people like these women
beside me nobody is nothin’ and I
dunno if you heard but I haven’t
exactly done this lately and I’m like
a little pee shy or whatever and I
know I didn’t ask them about this and
Howard if I know you you’ve got some
big bullshit finale planned and I
wasn’t included and I don’t wanna ruin
it bit I’m gonna because I’ve been
through some shit and there’s lotsa
people who I wouldn’t be here without
and only like eight of em are here and
only like four of em are musicians not
in this band so if Crassy Cassie,
Roxie Rotten, Dottie O.Z. and cause I
am full of love tonight, Zelda E.
Zekial care to come up on stage and
help me stumble through this bullshit?
Becky is wired and, drugs or no drugs, she is fun, energetic
and workable. Not a disaster.
The crowd goes more insane for this super group gathering as
one by one these women come out and bow to the applause.
Becky hugs each one and makes eye contact with Danny, Ania
and Tama (near Lauren, Tiffany and Roy) in the balcony.
She puts her arm around Zelda and steps to the mic and is
bursting with adrenaline and might explode.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Cut the bullshit and love each other,
okay?
People applaud and cannot wait to hear music and Zelda kisses
Becky. It’s really complete to see a rivalry buried publicly.
Becky pulls the women in and huddles, muttering the plan.
They take positions and the Akergirls get instruments and
Zelda gets a tambourine or some noisy hand instrument and
Becky and Mari and Ali exchange a warm and loving look and
Ali gives a drumstick count and the song starts.
It’s rousing, singalong ready. Everybody can take half a
verse and sing together, beautifully, on the choruses. Two
minute long burst of pure punk and the song has a narrative,
about the ups and downs of being on tour in a band with
nothing. One by one they share the mic to tell this story.
(the song is written by Alicia Bognanno/Bully)

122.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I stopped counting
Lost track of time
Ran out of patience
I know what’s mine, I know what’s mine
You get me angry
You read me wrong
I kinda like it.
Kills to belong, kills to belong.
If I don’t breath I can feel her barely walking
Take over me
She’s alive and I’m on to something
I’d give ten years for a piece of her mind
I would
I’d give a hundred just to hit rewind
My hands are easy
And my aim is blind
Resist the feeling
Control my mind, control my mind.
I beg politely.
To lie alone
Nothing’s forever.
This much I know. This much I know.
If I don’t breath I can feel her barely walking
Take over me
She’s alive and I’m on to something
I’d give ten years for a piece of her mind
I would
I’d give a hundred just to hit rewind
If I don’t breath....If I don’t breath...
It’s so fucking awesome and the crowd goes insane at the end.
Glorious beyond all belief. From the stage wings, Howard is
cheering and deeply touched.
(The VIP area: Ania, Danny, Tiffany, Lauren and Roy love it.
Danny makes quick eye contact with Becky and takes Tama
through an exit door.)
All seven women bow and things are so positive and Becky is
sweating like crazy and on her face there’s tears with the
sweat and she falls into a loving embrace with Mari and Ali,
who has come out from behind the kit.
Zelda and the Akergirls step back to let Something She have
this. Becky hugs all of them and the moment feels complete.
Becky has been occupied with where Danny was headed and is
laser focused on it and without saying anything walks off
quickly to intercept them. Drifting away from the victory.

Mari and Ali leave the stage and walk past Howard who doesn’t
know what will happen, alone now. The crowd is chanting:
CROWD
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!

THE VENUE, BEHIND THE STAGE - THAT SAME MOMENT

59

Stay with Becky, behind her, hoping to catch Danny. She only
makes it a few steps before seeing him standing there with
her daughter. He is proud and hands Tama to Becky once again.
Becky is standing in the exact same spot off the side of the
stage where she was in the first shot of the movie, pre
encore, and just like then the crowd is chanting.
CROWD (O.S.)
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!
She holds Tama who is happy and smiling because she’s never
seen her mom be so wild and has never heard rock before so
this is her first concert and first exposure to rock.
BECKY
Did you see mommy up there?
TAMA
Best song I ever saw!
Becky is woozy from adrenaline (and maybe more) and holds
Tama close to her. She can’t stand up. She leans on the wall.
BECKY
Momma is gonna be better, baby, for
you. I promise.
CROWD (O.S.)
BECKY! BECKY! BECKY!
Mari and Ali have been watching Becky with Tama.
Everybody knows that Becky only needed to get this one thing
out of the way to move on with the rest of her life. Becky
Something, on stage again. Drugs or no. Sober on stage for
the first time or simply back on stage after years away.
It’s all mostly over now. She’s not a junkie, really,
anymore. But recovery is a long process and Danny, Mari, and
Ali all know that and know that they need to be supportive of
Becky right now, as they always have been.
CROWD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
BECKY! BECKY!

124.
Howard comes back to find them. He looks so excited.
HOWARD
They want more. You got one more?
Becky looks at Mari and Ali and then down at Tama, just
holding her mom’s chest and being so happy because she now
loves rock and roll.
TAMA
Go play more momma!
Becky pauses and thinks. Mari and Ali are ready to go for one
more. Becky is now clear headed and determined once again.
Becky looks around at her loved ones. The crowd keeps
chanting as Mari and Ali embrace and look like acceptance and
peace have found them at last.
BECKY
No. That’s all I got. It’s over.
Becky holds Tama and closes her eyes as she leans back on the
wall.
END OF ACT FIVE.
THE END.
