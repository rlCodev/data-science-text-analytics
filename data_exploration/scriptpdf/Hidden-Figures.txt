Pulling up, we reveal: KATHERINE COLEMAN (8,) a peculiar,
quiet, mouse of a child, wearing glasses bigger than her
bookish face. Counting to herself.
A VOICE (her Mother’s) in the distance hollers out:
Katherine!

JOYLETTE COLEMAN (O.S.)
Come on now!

Katherine looks up. Sees a car stopped at the end of the
path. She runs off. Counting all the way.

their hands as they enter.
INT. WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS GRAMMAR SCHOOL - DAY - CONT.
A long hallway lined with windows. Sitting on a bench,
outside a Principal’s office, Katherine sketches (in a small
notebook) the window panes, highlighting all the geometric
shapes she discovers within:
KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
Isosceles, scalene, obtuse, equilateral,
rhombus...
On the windows opposite her: the tetris-like patterns of her
mind’s eye come alive.
KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) (CONT’D)
Trapezoid, tetrahedron, octahedron,
dodecahedron...

EXT. ROAD - INSTITUTE, VIRGINIA - DAY
The Coleman family car, hauling a trailer with all their
belongings, drives past a pasture dotted with COWS. A road
sign reads: Welcome to Institute, Virginia.
INT. COLEMAN FAMILY CAR - DRIVING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Katherine’s crowded in the back seat with her siblings
(CHARLES, MARGARET and HORACE.) She stares out the window,
studying the cows whizzing by, the patterns on their hides
forming shapes in her mind. She studies the shapes, only now
she’s...
INT. WEST VIRGINIA COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE - ANOTHER DAY
...staring out another window in a new classroom. A fancy
classroom in a prestigious academy. The class is full of
OLDER STUDENTS dressed in the best they have.
Unbeknownst to Katherine, her new teacher, PROFESSOR GRAVES,
is standing right in front of her.
PROFESSOR GRAVES
Ms. Coleman.
Katherine whips back to reality.

Embarrassed.

PROFESSOR GRAVES (CONT’D)
You find something out there more
interesting than quadratic equations?
Yes, sir.

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
I mean no, sir.

Professor Graves holds out a piece of chalk.
PROFESSOR GRAVES
Why don’t you figure out the equation on
the board?
Katherine looks at the chalkboard.
symbols, signs, parentheticals.

The equation looks Greek:

Professor Graves pushes the chalk closer.
Go on.

PROFESSOR GRAVES (CONT’D)

Katherine takes the chalk. Stands. Walks sheepishly to the
front of the class. Every eye on her.

CONTINUED:
She stands in front of the blackboard, the equation. Studies
it for the longest time. Inspecting every number, sign,
symbol. Wheels churning.
Then she starts to write. Slow and meticulous at first.
Then fast. Faster. With passion and fury.
The Students crane their heads.
Professor Graves rubs his temple.
And Katherine writes on, chalk dust dropping like snow from
her chalk stick. On and on and on...until she’s at the very
bottom, far side of the board. She circles the answer.
Stands and faces the class. The equation behind her dwarfing
her in stature. She clears her throat...
KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
If the product of two terms is zero, then
common sense says at least one of the two
terms has to be zero to start with. So,
if you move all the terms over to one
side, you can put the quadratics into a
form that can be factored, allowing that
side of the equation to equal zero. Once
you’ve done that, it’s pretty straight
forward from there...
You can hear a pin drop. There’s nothing to say.

The police car screams down the road at a million miles an
hour. Dorothy’s car lunges right on its tail.
INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Mary’s driving like a mad-woman. Loving every minute of it.
Dorothy’s in the passenger seat, white knuckling the
dashboard. And Katherine’s in the back, holding onto the
ceiling. Praying.
DOROTHY
Slow down, Mary! You’re too close!
MARY
He said to follow him.
DOROTHY

EXT. NASA - LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER - DAY - LATER
The sprawling campus of NASA: hangars, wind tunnels, research
buildings, surrounded by tall, barbed wire fences and
SECURITY.
The police car slows, pulls to the shoulder, as Dorothy’s car
speeds past. The White Cop waves them on.
And our camera floats up to...
EXT. SPACE - DAY
From the vast blackness of space...looking down on Planet
Earth. Quiet. Picturesque. Peaceful.
Then: a rumbling sound creeps up. And the camera pans to
find...a massive ROCKET burning up through the earth’s
atmosphere. Atop the rocket, a capsule shakes, rattles,
grinds. The noise is deafening.
We then hear a RUSSIAN VOICE, military-esque. The VOICE then
translates into TURKISH...matter of fact. And finally: The
CRACKLING VOICE of a radio communication in English. Not
happy at all. Tense.
CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO)
Approximate speed: 17,400 mph. Ascend

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The Oval Office. President Kennedy is handed a briefing doc.
He’s worried. The VOICE OF AN AIDE:
PRESIDENT’S AIDE (O.S.)
Latest intelligence on the Soviet booster
rocket still in relay, Mr. President.
INT. US CENTRAL COMMAND - CONTINUOUS
A room packed with US MILITARY BRASS. JIM WEBB, NASA
ADMINISTRATOR, a hard, powerful man, is front and center.
All eyes are on the radar screen plotting the rocket’s
trajectory.
CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO)
Disengage booster rocket. We are go.

The booster rocket falls back to Earth, as the dislodged
capsule floats at us, into the black of space.

He leans forward, owl-eyed on the massive screens tracking
the rocket. And then:
CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO)
Orbital entry is...go.
SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The capsule twists on axis, revealing...the blood-red hammer
and sickle of the Soviet Union. This is Korabl-Sputnik-4.
The Russian Military Communication crackles in:
RUSSIAN MILITARY ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

All systems safe. Confirmed. Orbital
entry is established.

A SCREENING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
A black and white film reel plays.
Conference.

It’s a Russian Press

A RUSSIAN SCIENTIST is holding a small, wiry dog in a
cosmonaut vest. This is ZVEZDOCHKA, the world’s first space
traveler: a Jack Russell Terrier mix. He barks.
RUSSIAN SCIENTIST
(in Russian, subtitled in English)
Zvezdochka is ready to go again.

The hoarse voice of Jim Webb breaks in:
JIM WEBB (O.S.)
A goddamn dog! And a goddamn mannequin!
Webb steps up out of his seat, the news reel plays across his
back. The screening room is packed with MILITARY BRASS and
NASA ENGINEERS. Including: Al Harrison, Lead Engineer, PAUL
STAFFORD, Associate Engineer, SAM TURNER, and Harrison’s
Secretary, RUTH.
JIM WEBB (CONT’D)
And then a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead drops down in the
middle of Des Moines.
Harrison stands, holds up his hand. The news reel abruptly
stops. Lights come up. It’s funeral wake quiet. Until,
Paul Stafford speaks out of turn.
PAUL STAFFORD
Well, that’s a pretty big jump, sir.
Bad move.

Webb turns to Stafford.
JIM WEBB
Who the hell is he?

Harrison defends his man.
AL HARRISON
Paul Stafford...our Lead Engineer, Mr.
Webb. I think what he meant to say is
that speculation, at least on our side of
the equation, can be dangerous.
Webb wags a finger at Stafford.
JIM WEBB
You know what’s dangerous...inaction.
Inaction and indecision. The Russians
have a spy satellite lapping the planet.
Taking pictures of God knows what. The
President is demanding an immediate
response. No more delays. Alan Shepard,
John Glenn, your uncle Bob. Doesn’t
matter, just get us up there, Harrison.
We can’t justify a space program that
doesn't put anything in space.

EXT. HALLS OF NASA (IBM COMPUTER HALLWAY) - CONTINUOUS
Footsteps echo off the marble floor, as Harrison walks with
Paul Stafford, Sam Turner, Ruth, and the rest of the TEAM.
AL HARRISON
(to Stafford)
How did that feel in there, Paul? Do you
think you enlightened the Administrator?
Stafford has no response.
AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
He didn’t look enlightened to me.
Harrison stops.

He cleans his glasses.

Addresses SAM.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
He look enlightened to you, Sam?
SAM TURNER
Not particularly.
Paul nods.

Harrison walks away.

The Team keeps up.

AL HARRISON
And just so you know, he’s not wrong
about what he said in there. You know
that, right? Because now that they can
get up there, a bomb will follow. That’s
what happens to all our good ideas.
Harrison stops again. Stands in front of a window staring at
something we can’t see. He’s quiet for the longest time.
AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Where’s the machine?

have a single person, in this entire
building, that can handle Analytic
Geometry?
RUTH
That’s what I’ve been told.
AL HARRISON
Well, tell me something else, Ruth. Like
we’re going to find such a person, before
the Russians plant a flag on the damn
moon.

At the back of the room, Harrison paces in his glass bubble,

For the briefest moment, everyone seems to be looking at the
black woman who just entered their world. But it’s just a

Katherine walks to her station, way at the back of the room,

She looks at the Engineer toiling aside her, it’s Paul
Stafford. He looks at Katherine. Doesn’t smile. Just
studies her.
Harrison (with Zielinski) steps out of his office, eating a

that they’ll be asking questions about
our work. Do I need to remind
everyone...that we are putting a human on
top of a missile and shooting him into
space? It’s never been done before. And
